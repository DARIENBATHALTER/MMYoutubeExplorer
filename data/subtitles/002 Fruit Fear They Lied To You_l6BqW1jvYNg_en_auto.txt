[25.88 - 31.24] fatigue or any other symptom or
[28.44 - 34.52] condition you're far from from
[31.24 - 38.64] alone living with symptoms has become
[34.52 - 41.72] The New Normal so no more guessing games
[38.64 - 45.92] it's time to get answers welcome to the
[41.72 - 49.28] medical medium podcast I'm Anthony
[45.92 - 53.24] William let's talk about fruit fear and
[49.28 - 56.04] how dangerous fruit fear has become they
[53.24 - 59.04] lied to you and they lie straight to
[56.04 - 62.48] your face so that you do the dirty work
[59.04 - 66.16] for them and spread their lies and
[62.48 - 69.56] disinformation far and wide over time
[66.16 - 73.28] they rob and steal any chance for you to
[69.56 - 77.12] heal they keep you lost and scared and
[73.28 - 81.28] keep you in fear fruit is bad fruit can
[77.12 - 84.68] harm you fruit can kill you avoid fruit
[81.28 - 87.84] they say there's some realities you must
[84.68 - 90.84] know about the war on fruit did you hear
[87.84 - 93.12] that I said the war on fruit
[90.84 - 96.56] yeah and where it's leading us in our
[93.12 - 99.56] coming days the results of what happens
[96.56 - 102.68] when fruit fear in the health movement
[99.56 - 105.52] completely gets its way and no one wants
[102.68 - 108.52] to eat any fruit because they're totally
[105.52 - 110.64] afraid and scared so let me give you a
[108.52 - 113.88] picture of what will take place not too
[110.64 - 116.00] far off in the distant future and so let
[113.88 - 119.04] me tell you a story so let's go into it
[116.00 - 121.84] now the demand for fruit grows smaller
[119.04 - 124.60] and smaller as as the years go by
[121.84 - 128.32] grocery stores worldwide are throwing
[124.60 - 131.60] away more and more fruit because people
[128.32 - 133.76] aren't buying it this leads us to the
[131.60 - 136.80] health food stores and grocery stores
[133.76 - 139.24] ordering less and less fruit fruit
[136.80 - 142.16] juices such as apple juice and other
[139.24 - 144.88] organic Whole Food pure juices just sit
[142.16 - 147.88] on the store shelves and collect dust
[144.88 - 150.88] and no more is restocked and ordered
[147.88 - 155.32] because of the fear spread by the fruit
[150.88 - 158.52] demonizer that 100% pure organic juices
[155.32 - 162.08] are dangerous for your health and can
[158.52 - 164.52] even kill you more and more anti fruit
[162.08 - 167.48] propaganda keeps on being promoted
[164.52 - 170.56] nonstop without any science and research
[167.48 - 175.00] showing us evidence that fruit is bad
[170.56 - 178.24] for us Fruit Farms Orchards orange
[175.00 - 181.64] groves Bramble Farms watermelon patches
[178.24 - 184.16] melon patches banana Farms pineapple
[181.64 - 187.28] Farms are not making enough money to
[184.16 - 190.00] keep equipment running and Manpower they
[187.28 - 192.40] just shut down land that's owned by
[190.00 - 194.72] these fruit farmers both small farms and
[192.40 - 197.20] big farms have to burn their Orchards
[194.72 - 201.00] and Groves down in order to clear the
[197.20 - 204.80] land to try to reestablish a new way of
[201.00 - 207.40] living fruit farm land that is least
[204.80 - 210.56] they build housing on and also burn all
[207.40 - 213.00] the Orchards down the amount of burning
[210.56 - 215.24] worldwide of these fruit trees and
[213.00 - 217.88] brambles will be
[215.24 - 220.32] catastrophic this will admit tremendous
[217.88 - 223.44] amounts of smoke and Ash into the
[220.32 - 226.24] atmosphere hindering Wildlife
[223.44 - 228.28] globally and because there's that much
[226.24 - 230.76] ancient fruit land and Farms that have
[228.28 - 233.28] been here feeding the populations for
[230.76 - 235.52] hundreds of years and when it goes up in
[233.28 - 238.36] flames it's
[235.52 - 240.40] disastrous every season as the fruit
[238.36 - 243.28] naturally drops and sits on the ground
[240.40 - 247.20] in The Orchards it feeds animals and
[243.28 - 250.00] Wildlife like deer and moose bear Fox
[247.20 - 253.04] birds and other Wildlife before winter
[250.00 - 256.28] comes it keeps them alive and gives them
[253.04 - 259.28] a fighting chance to survive the Year
[256.28 - 261.16] this disappears and so does a large
[259.28 - 264.32] portion of wildlife that has been
[261.16 - 266.80] feeding on Fallen fruit for hundreds of
[264.32 - 269.36] years bees already are losing the
[266.80 - 271.48] ability to thrive in the future they're
[269.36 - 274.52] lack last chance of survival will end
[271.48 - 277.64] with the loss of the blossoms from the
[274.52 - 280.16] cherry blossoms apple blossoms pear
[277.64 - 282.04] blossoms Peach blossoms nectarine
[280.16 - 284.44] blossoms and Plum blossoms and
[282.04 - 285.60] watermelon blossoms and virtually every
[284.44 - 289.04] other
[285.60 - 292.12] fruit bees rely on fruit trees and their
[289.04 - 294.28] fruit blossoms worldwide to sustain and
[292.12 - 296.88] survive and because there aren't enough
[294.28 - 298.68] wild flowers to feed them already never
[296.88 - 300.64] mind in the future they're going to
[298.68 - 302.72] suffer greatly
[300.64 - 305.08] experts in the health field are unaware
[302.72 - 307.64] of this environmental change that's on
[305.08 - 310.64] its way and the ecosystem shift that
[307.64 - 313.96] will occur fruit is one of the most
[310.64 - 316.68] important parts of our ecosystem without
[313.96 - 319.72] its balanced it will be thrown off and
[316.68 - 321.76] it will trigger famine and loss of life
[319.72 - 326.00] and the slow destruction of our
[321.76 - 330.52] environment on an inner way and every
[326.00 - 333.48] way meat butter milk cheese yogurt has
[330.52 - 336.24] become scarce and hard to find without
[333.48 - 339.28] the pollinators it will affect
[336.24 - 342.20] livestock grass-fed beef from grass-fed
[339.28 - 344.44] cows don't eat grass only they are in
[342.20 - 347.68] the fields eating wild flowers from
[344.44 - 350.80] herbs that prevent the cows from getting
[347.68 - 354.48] disease with the loss of the pollinators
[350.80 - 356.60] Bine viruses and bacteria will dominate
[354.48 - 360.00] and livestock will have to be put down
[356.60 - 362.20] in the masses because the bees spread
[360.00 - 365.76] immune system building properties to
[362.20 - 368.52] each Wildflower for the cow to consume
[365.76 - 370.80] and now that the bees are gone the cows
[368.52 - 373.72] at graze are not getting their
[370.80 - 376.56] medicine phytochemical compounds pass
[373.72 - 379.52] from flower to Flower by the bees in the
[376.56 - 382.64] fields the livestock grze in support
[379.52 - 385.36] their immune system meanwhile Health
[382.64 - 388.40] influencers on social media will Echo
[385.36 - 390.84] the no fruit propaganda more than ever
[388.40 - 393.44] before while they are battling their new
[390.84 - 397.52] found symptoms and conditions not
[393.44 - 400.20] realizing how important fruit was and is
[397.52 - 402.80] for the world or their own healing
[400.20 - 405.60] process the largest percent of the food
[402.80 - 408.52] supply for the bees are fruit trees and
[405.60 - 410.96] fruit blossoms now that these are gone
[408.52 - 413.64] there will be pockets of be famine in
[410.96 - 415.76] areas all around the world where they
[413.64 - 418.12] just disappear quickly until they're
[415.76 - 420.84] finally finished and when the bees are
[418.12 - 423.28] gone the butterfly flies follow and
[420.84 - 426.44] these Godly pollinators are a big part
[423.28 - 429.04] of how our whole food chain survives
[426.44 - 431.36] honey which is a medicine that will be
[429.04 - 434.04] needed in the future because of our
[431.36 - 437.52] broken immune systems and the viral
[434.04 - 440.52] plagues to come will be rare and too
[437.52 - 443.36] pricey for almost anyone to purchase
[440.52 - 446.68] propolis will be a critical Hidden Gem
[443.36 - 449.56] that is sparse and needed and finally
[446.68 - 452.96] disappears hummingbirds that migrate in
[449.56 - 455.36] the spring rely on fruit blossoms to
[452.96 - 458.68] survive because there's not enough wild
[455.36 - 461.08] flowers in Blossom during the spring so
[458.68 - 463.52] large portions of the hummingbirds will
[461.08 - 465.92] disappear and die because they can't
[463.52 - 468.52] make their Journey without the fruit
[465.92 - 470.12] blossoms then there's the industries
[468.52 - 472.88] that will capitalize on The
[470.12 - 475.16] Disappearance of fruit fruit flavorings
[472.88 - 477.36] will explode in the marketplace
[475.16 - 480.04] synthetic fruit flavorings that will be
[477.36 - 482.92] deemed safe by paid for science and
[480.04 - 485.96] research will be in high demand because
[482.92 - 489.20] of the loss of the real fruit in the
[485.96 - 492.16] world and people will long for Fruity
[489.20 - 493.16] sweet flavoring of raspberry strawberry
[492.16 - 496.00] and
[493.16 - 498.04] watermelon the chemical industry will go
[496.00 - 500.68] into production and the amount of
[498.04 - 504.08] chemical byproduct produced will be
[500.68 - 506.36] destroying the ecosystem even more
[504.08 - 507.96] children will never get to experience
[506.36 - 511.32] eating a piece of fruit in their
[507.96 - 514.28] childhood and won't receive bioavailable
[511.32 - 517.24] vitamin C and other antiviral compounds
[514.28 - 520.04] from fresh fruit during a critical time
[517.24 - 522.56] their immune system is in development
[520.04 - 525.28] infertility will be on the rise more
[522.56 - 528.16] than ever before women's reproductive
[525.28 - 531.44] system diseases will worsen and be at a
[528.16 - 534.12] level we have never even dreamed of
[531.44 - 538.00] women's diets will be lacking fruit more
[534.12 - 541.12] so than ever before it will be rare a
[538.00 - 543.40] woman has one piece of of fruit a year
[541.12 - 545.80] which will worsen infertility and this
[543.40 - 548.72] will threaten the existence of the human
[545.80 - 552.24] race how did we get to this place at
[548.72 - 554.80] this point in time in the future no one
[552.24 - 558.04] realized that they were being used and
[554.80 - 560.92] lied to about fruit so let's talk about
[558.04 - 563.68] today you guys did you ever think about
[560.92 - 567.24] what could happen like if fruit is just
[563.68 - 569.72] done like gone there's a Tipping Point
[567.24 - 572.64] where stuff just goes wrong just like
[569.72 - 574.44] when someone's sick and they get sicker
[572.64 - 576.40] and sicker and sicker there's a Tipping
[574.44 - 579.56] Point there too that you never want to
[576.40 - 580.96] be in or never want to go to so in the
[579.56 - 583.28] present moment right now women's
[580.96 - 586.80] infertility is on the rise you know
[583.28 - 589.52] fibroids endometriosis PCOS reproductive
[586.80 - 591.24] cysts reproductive cancers because women
[589.52 - 593.28] aren't eating enough fruit that's
[591.24 - 595.16] actually a part of it I mean there's a
[593.28 - 597.76] lot of part of it but that's a part of
[595.16 - 600.64] it there a lot of pieces instead women
[597.76 - 603.32] are told to eat eggs eggs that's what
[600.64 - 605.56] they're told to do it's like replace
[603.32 - 608.52] fruit something that's been around
[605.56 - 610.00] forever and just no just eggs replace
[608.52 - 612.80] everything I guess because that's what
[610.00 - 615.40] it is is everybody's told to eat eggs
[612.80 - 618.08] which ironically eggs worse in
[615.40 - 622.36] reproductive system conditions by
[618.08 - 625.36] feeding the very viruses that cause
[622.36 - 628.04] women's reproductive system diseases and
[625.36 - 631.48] symptoms and conditions right and so
[628.04 - 634.52] I've talked about that for eggs feed
[631.48 - 637.36] viruses viruses that are in the
[634.52 - 642.44] reproductive system creating fibroids
[637.36 - 645.32] cysts PCOS infertility you know fruit is
[642.44 - 647.76] antiviral and it's being taken away and
[645.32 - 650.16] you're like what no way it's not being
[647.76 - 651.64] taken away how's that possible you know
[650.16 - 655.36] people can make choices they can have
[651.64 - 658.04] fruit or not yeah well everybody's being
[655.36 - 660.72] told not to eat fruit these days fear
[658.04 - 663.56] fruit fear big time and it's
[660.72 - 665.56] infectious it really is infectious it's
[663.56 - 667.52] easy to get tricked I mean you haven't
[665.56 - 669.24] yet maybe you're maybe you're like a
[667.52 - 672.08] lucky one that's like didn't even know
[669.24 - 674.12] about it or something but it's so
[672.08 - 675.96] infectious where it's like instantly
[674.12 - 678.20] like what fruit's bad well it's going to
[675.96 - 679.92] feed mold it's going to feed something
[678.20 - 682.44] what is it going to do create candida
[679.92 - 684.64] it's going to make me sick is it what
[682.44 - 687.28] and that's what everybody's doing now
[684.64 - 689.76] and look fruit is critical in keeping
[687.28 - 692.28] our immune system strong
[689.76 - 694.08] I'm just scratching the surface right
[692.28 - 696.92] here of the
[694.08 - 700.00] sabotage that a small group of health
[696.92 - 701.28] authori started more than 10 years ago
[700.00 - 705.16] did you hear
[701.28 - 708.56] that because I hope you heard that
[705.16 - 712.72] Sabotage by a small group of Health
[708.56 - 717.72] authorities over 10 years ago that had a
[712.72 - 720.04] master plan and we just buying into it
[717.72 - 724.04] yes there were certain individuals who
[720.04 - 726.16] started fruit fear yeah get that message
[724.04 - 729.28] get that memo now because it's a big
[726.16 - 732.52] deal and and they were purposely planted
[729.28 - 736.40] into the health world to spread one of
[732.52 - 740.08] the largest greatest deceptions in lies
[736.40 - 743.20] of our day that fruit is bad fruit is
[740.08 - 745.28] harmful fruit's dangerous I'll spell it
[743.20 - 747.64] out for you okay I'll just spell it
[745.28 - 751.28] right out just straight out people were
[747.64 - 755.32] planted by IND Industries to purposely
[751.28 - 758.16] spread disinformation about fruit in the
[755.32 - 760.60] holistic health movement to stop people
[758.16 - 764.08] from eating fruit and it's
[760.60 - 767.08] ingenious ingenious because it's
[764.08 - 769.44] working it's actually brilliant because
[767.08 - 772.04] it's working that's how good at it they
[769.44 - 773.64] are and it convince good-hearted
[772.04 - 775.24] professionals and health like look
[773.64 - 777.00] you're probably thinking no no my

[781.52 - 786.52] great person they got Pure
[783.72 - 789.96] intentions absolutely but they get
[786.52 - 791.88] convinced that fruit needs to be avoided
[789.96 - 793.44] you see especially the sweeter fruits
[791.88 - 795.12] have you heard that one like oh yeah
[793.44 - 798.20] stay away from sweet fruits stay away

[800.64 - 806.64] reality see I know there is something
[803.52 - 809.00] you guys know a lot of people in health
[806.64 - 811.56] know okay and it's that there are
[809.00 - 816.88] certain industries in the conventional

[839.68 - 843.40] Keep Us Alive with like drugs and stuff
[841.56 - 845.76] or you can look at it this way to keep
[843.40 - 848.12] us sick however you want to look at it
[845.76 - 851.40] they go broke if we stay healthy or
[848.12 - 855.68] we're just not really that sick at all
[851.40 - 859.52] sickness is the money making machine duh
[855.68 - 861.28] duh and you guys know this totally right
[859.52 - 862.52] but there's something you don't know I'm
[861.28 - 864.84] going to drop a whole bunch of more
[862.52 - 867.52] stuff you guys don't know and it's this
[864.84 - 870.68] it infected a part of the alternative
[867.52 - 870.68] medicine world
[870.92 - 875.96] Jeepers it got to the herbalist who once
[874.12 - 878.96] knew fruit was good for us many years
[875.96 - 880.52] ago it got to the Cairo in the village
[878.96 - 882.32] the chiropractor in the village who
[880.52 - 885.00] never had a problem with bananas until
[882.32 - 886.76] now forget it chiropractor is not going
[885.00 - 889.04] to recommend bananas anymore very few
[886.76 - 891.24] have ever unless they got reignited by
[889.04 - 892.80] fruit information that's been spreading
[891.24 - 895.76] around from medical medium information
[892.80 - 897.68] all these years to fight this battle and
[895.76 - 899.88] and this information even you know this
[897.68 - 903.04] misinformation fruit fear got to the
[899.88 - 905.28] Healer in the next town that loved
[903.04 - 907.56] giving people apples to help them heal
[905.28 - 911.12] recommended them but now no more no way
[907.56 - 913.60] stay away from those sweet apples the
[911.12 - 917.16] strategy was to put out the word that
[913.60 - 919.16] fruit causes multiple problems right you
[917.16 - 921.04] heard it diabetes oh stay away from
[919.16 - 924.52] fruit with diabetes you know

[932.48 - 938.00] with sibo or anything like that just
[934.84 - 940.48] don't eat fruit uh it feeds
[938.00 - 942.88] candida if you got candida or it's going
[940.48 - 945.56] to give you candida causes it or you got
[942.88 - 947.92] lime disease stay away from fruit and
[945.56 - 949.84] causes cancer don't eat a piece of fruit

[949.84 - 954.08] going to cause cancer oh wait don't have
[952.68 - 957.28] any fruit because it's going to rot your
[954.08 - 961.00] teeth or causes UTI you guys might have
[957.28 - 963.20] heard that before right yeah yeah it's
[961.00 - 967.12] unbelievable and any other condition you
[963.20 - 969.76] can think of so fruit was weaponized oh
[967.12 - 972.60] man how can like something that like
[969.76 - 974.76] simple something that pure something
[972.60 - 976.64] that natural be weaponizing like
[974.76 - 978.08] weaponized like what is he talking about
[976.64 - 980.40] right you're probably like thinking it
[978.08 - 983.64] was weaponized it was weaponized
[980.40 - 986.84] purposely against the chronically ill
[983.64 - 989.00] the underdog it was weaponized against
[986.84 - 991.48] the underdog slowly against the
[989.00 - 993.00] chronically ill not all at once though
[991.48 - 996.28] this is a slow progression and it's
[993.00 - 999.84] kicking in gear more and more and here's
[996.28 - 1002.44] the thing you guys partly why it's slow
[999.84 - 1004.44] is because people's Common Sense
[1002.44 - 1007.88] understands that fruit probably isn't
[1004.44 - 1010.68] bad that's what's funny everybody's
[1007.88 - 1012.52] Common Sense knows somewhere in the back
[1010.68 - 1015.36] of their mind somewhere in the back of
[1012.52 - 1019.44] their skull somewhere in there that
[1015.36 - 1023.40] fruit is actually good or fruit can't be
[1019.44 - 1026.64] bad it's in all of us it's in our heads
[1023.40 - 1029.16] okay all of us it can't be bad how can
[1026.64 - 1031.40] it be and that's what made this whole
[1029.16 - 1034.48] fruit take down this weaponizing the war
[1031.40 - 1036.92] on fruit take longer because people are
[1034.48 - 1039.32] like not totally getting tricked they're
[1036.92 - 1042.12] just like what and so people still eat a
[1039.32 - 1045.36] little bit of fruit in places so the
[1042.12 - 1046.88] industries planted fruit demonizes in
[1045.36 - 1049.16] health movement and this is the next
[1046.88 - 1052.76] part I'm going to talk about the
[1049.16 - 1057.36] industries planted fruit haters fruit
[1052.76 - 1061.12] fear creators okay demonizes to inspire
[1057.36 - 1062.88] good intentioned health experts good
[1061.12 - 1066.44] intentioned health
[1062.88 - 1070.28] authorities that fruit was bad and then
[1066.44 - 1072.84] have that shrinkle down to local Hol
[1070.28 - 1074.96] holistic health experts like in your
[1072.84 - 1077.60] town like in your village on social
[1074.96 - 1080.16] media cool people doing their thing you
[1077.60 - 1082.64] know like health health coaches and you
[1080.16 - 1085.00] know and trainers and all kinds of
[1082.64 - 1086.64] people have incredible intentions that
[1085.00 - 1089.16] actually want their people better and
[1086.64 - 1091.88] stronger but they get totally
[1089.16 - 1094.48] confused and that's how it worked they
[1091.88 - 1097.60] became convinced that fruit is harmful
[1094.48 - 1100.68] for anyone so they attack Fruit on
[1097.60 - 1103.40] social media in the doctor's offices
[1100.68 - 1105.88] this doesn't mean that everyone who fell
[1103.40 - 1107.68] sucker into this attack on fruit is
[1105.88 - 1110.20] involved so I don't want you thinking if
[1107.68 - 1112.88] someone is ripping down fruit ripping it
[1110.20 - 1115.28] apart right you're like oh my God they
[1112.88 - 1117.16] must be one of those planted people in
[1115.28 - 1120.28] the industry that you know no that's not
[1117.16 - 1123.32] it it I'll talk about who those might be
[1120.28 - 1128.48] in a minute but it's spreading like
[1123.32 - 1132.12] wildfire by good people not purposely
[1128.48 - 1133.80] but it got to all the good people and so
[1132.12 - 1135.28] all the good people with good intentions
[1133.80 - 1137.44] doing good stuff in health they're like
[1135.28 - 1139.96] no fruit's bad stay away from it watch
[1137.44 - 1143.52] out no sweet fruit fruits don't eat that
[1139.96 - 1146.76] don't eat this okay but there are
[1143.52 - 1149.64] certain individuals that played a role
[1146.76 - 1152.92] in starting this fruit fear in the
[1149.64 - 1156.12] beginning they started the war on fruit
[1152.92 - 1160.04] and started the lie that fruit causes
[1156.12 - 1163.04] harm it was a bad seed man planted in a
[1160.04 - 1167.20] dark way to bring us where we are today
[1163.04 - 1171.16] with no merit no science no evidence no
[1167.20 - 1175.40] proof in any way way that fruit causes
[1171.16 - 1178.04] anything or is bad for you no proof and
[1175.40 - 1181.80] even the most basic lie of all at the
[1178.04 - 1183.00] start that fruit feeds candida or fruit
[1181.80 - 1185.80] causes
[1183.00 - 1189.36] candida you know an apple doesn't feed
[1185.80 - 1191.36] candida you guys but chocolate cake will
[1189.36 - 1194.04] you know vegan or animal-based chocolate
[1191.36 - 1195.68] cake so let's talk about what what's in
[1194.04 - 1198.24] Fruit let's go into that a little bit
[1195.68 - 1201.20] cuz I think that's important right there
[1198.24 - 1203.04] trace minerals did is that something you
[1201.20 - 1205.84] don't want in you trace minerals is that
[1203.04 - 1208.08] bad uh phytochemical compounds that are
[1205.84 - 1210.84] critical for healing like anti-cancerous
[1208.08 - 1213.20] compounds wait a minute fruits loaded up
[1210.84 - 1215.60] with anti-cancerous compounds uh you
[1213.20 - 1217.52] don't want that in you um vitamin C you
[1215.60 - 1220.68] don't want that in you either right no
[1217.52 - 1223.32] that's bad vitamin C uh anti-cancerous
[1220.68 - 1225.36] compounds antiviral compounds are in
[1223.32 - 1226.76] Fruit oh you don't want that in you
[1225.36 - 1228.92] especially right now with what's going
[1226.76 - 1232.08] down especially every
[1228.92 - 1234.76] scared crapless right now just you know
[1232.08 - 1236.88] and locked in their homes okay so you
[1234.76 - 1239.44] don't you don't want antiviral compounds
[1236.88 - 1242.68] that's in Fruit antibacterial compounds
[1239.44 - 1244.16] antifungal compounds nutrients totally
[1242.68 - 1247.52] packed with nutrients all kinds
[1244.16 - 1250.92] undiscovered also antioxidants Living
[1247.52 - 1254.44] Water critical glucose no everybody
[1250.92 - 1256.64] would rather not have any fruit but
[1254.44 - 1258.56] drink some maybe coffee from a coffee
[1256.64 - 1262.12] shop that has straight tap water right
[1258.56 - 1263.88] from City tap water and but stay away
[1262.12 - 1266.12] from a piece of fruit with living water
[1263.88 - 1271.36] in it that's pure and you know what else
[1266.12 - 1273.60] fruit has fruit has worm expelling
[1271.36 - 1275.52] properties so everybody's freaking out
[1273.60 - 1276.84] about worms are looking in the toilet
[1275.52 - 1278.48] you know and they're looking in the
[1276.84 - 1281.00] toilet they're looking for a worm that's
[1278.48 - 1283.88] 5 in long that's really just some food
[1281.00 - 1286.68] all like interwined and wrapped around
[1283.88 - 1289.16] itself and or maybe you know I always
[1286.68 - 1291.32] tell people the matter what if you're
[1289.16 - 1293.28] going to see a worm go in the toilet it
[1291.32 - 1295.04] better be moving and it better be
[1293.28 - 1298.08] swimming then you can guarantee that was
[1295.04 - 1300.80] a worm and but I'll tell you right now
[1298.08 - 1304.32] fruit has worm expelling
[1300.80 - 1307.80] properties what's in Fruit they say that
[1304.32 - 1311.00] they say okay the demonizer say sugar
[1307.80 - 1312.84] and sugar is bad so hey you you know
[1311.00 - 1314.24] that right sugar is bad you hear it all
[1312.84 - 1317.84] the time that's what you hear fruit
[1314.24 - 1321.88] sugar sugar bad what huh did you know
[1317.84 - 1324.36] with without sugar you die interesting
[1321.88 - 1327.08] so without sugar you die uh that's a
[1324.36 - 1331.04] funny one did you know every single
[1327.08 - 1335.72] movement you make task you do thought
[1331.04 - 1338.68] you think uh words you speak hello is
[1335.72 - 1341.84] because of glucose that's
[1338.68 - 1344.56] glucose and there are sugar in the foods
[1341.84 - 1346.76] you think have no sugar check this out
[1344.56 - 1351.16] all right let's go into it a little bit
[1346.76 - 1354.64] there is sugar in Foods you think ain't
[1351.16 - 1357.64] got no sugar all right meat for example
[1354.64 - 1361.12] I can't have sugar in it meat are you
[1357.64 - 1364.96] kidding caramelized sugar when you cook
[1361.12 - 1367.40] meat it's caramelized sugar in there
[1364.96 - 1369.28] where' it come from well no one talks
[1367.40 - 1370.88] about it because I guess nobody knows or
[1369.28 - 1374.72] something let me tell you where it comes
[1370.88 - 1378.64] from it comes from the blood of the
[1374.72 - 1382.84] animal which was loaded with sugar
[1378.64 - 1385.80] glucose the animal can only survive say
[1382.84 - 1388.28] like a cow eating grass which is sweet
[1385.80 - 1390.64] believe it or not right down to the root
[1388.28 - 1394.44] there's a lot of Sweetness in there all
[1390.64 - 1396.96] that Sugar from that grass all right
[1394.44 - 1401.28] that gets munched up and munched up and
[1396.96 - 1404.52] and basically Juiced in that cow's mouth
[1401.28 - 1408.40] and that sugar right there is their
[1404.52 - 1412.44] glucose for grassfed beef and and the
[1408.40 - 1414.48] animal's blood sugar so it could survive
[1412.44 - 1417.68] and stay strong and
[1414.48 - 1419.80] Thrive so when you cook a piece of meat
[1417.68 - 1421.92] which I'm Pro meat I'm Pro plant-based
[1419.80 - 1423.44] too you know but when you cook a piece
[1421.92 - 1425.20] of meat because that's what you like if
[1423.44 - 1427.40] that's what you like when you're cooking
[1425.20 - 1429.32] it there's sugar in it and then when
[1427.40 - 1431.60] you're cooking it it
[1429.32 - 1433.88] caramelizes that's what happens with
[1431.60 - 1437.12] sugar the minute you put heat to it the
[1433.88 - 1439.56] minute you cook with it it caramelizes
[1437.12 - 1441.84] so that's that's the the blood sugar and
[1439.56 - 1443.68] it's never measured it's not measured on
[1441.84 - 1445.36] any scale science and research doesn't
[1443.68 - 1446.88] care about it no I just care about
[1445.36 - 1450.40] protein they don't care about the sugar
[1446.88 - 1452.56] and meat you know they never dial it in
[1450.40 - 1455.88] they will never tell you how much sugar
[1452.56 - 1458.16] is in a piece of meat or Animal product
[1455.88 - 1459.92] and this isn't an anti-animal product
[1458.16 - 1461.52] campaign I don't have a diet belief
[1459.92 - 1464.12] system anybody who's know knows medical
[1461.52 - 1465.56] medium information is whatever diet
[1464.12 - 1467.36] belief system you have I'm about
[1465.56 - 1470.28] plugging in powerful tools so you can
[1467.36 - 1472.92] make it work work for your belief so you
[1470.28 - 1476.52] can heal so I'm Pro meat I'm Pro
[1472.92 - 1478.52] plant-based but listen without sugar you
[1476.52 - 1482.56] hit the floor you lay down and you
[1478.52 - 1485.48] slowly die and there is sugar in the
[1482.56 - 1487.92] foods that you love that are fat-based
[1485.48 - 1490.68] so you're thinking that's ridiculous I
[1487.92 - 1493.20] don't die when I eat all my fatty foods
[1490.68 - 1497.40] I'm not dying yeah because avocado has
[1493.20 - 1500.24] sugar in it avocado has plenty of sugar
[1497.40 - 1501.56] in it by the way hey you know remember
[1500.24 - 1504.48] that story I told you at the beginning
[1501.56 - 1506.32] in this podcast avocados won't be around
[1504.48 - 1508.32] either in the future cuz they're going
[1506.32 - 1510.44] to need to be pollinated by a lot of
[1508.32 - 1514.52] bees in order to keep the supply of
[1510.44 - 1516.64] avocados going and avocados hey if you
[1514.52 - 1518.28] love them and they're part of our trendy
[1516.64 - 1520.84] diet now they won't be here in the
[1518.28 - 1522.96] future cuz the bees will be gone if the
[1520.84 - 1525.04] war on fruit continues there won't be
[1522.96 - 1528.32] any more bees there won't be enough
[1525.04 - 1530.52] avocado trees or bees this is say people
[1528.32 - 1532.72] who love them you know byebye avocado
[1530.52 - 1535.32] toast it's gone it's
[1532.72 - 1538.80] toast which is kind of funny because
[1535.32 - 1541.68] toast anyway which is sugar even though
[1538.80 - 1543.52] it's gluten-free it's still sugar but
[1541.68 - 1545.12] you didn't think you eat really any
[1543.52 - 1547.08] sugar right because a lot of people say
[1545.12 - 1548.96] I don't eat any sugar really and they're
[1547.08 - 1550.72] like hey I'm really enjoying my avocado
[1548.96 - 1552.20] toast which is great because avocados
[1550.72 - 1553.68] are the healthiest one of the healthiest
[1552.20 - 1556.56] fats right if you're going to have fats
[1553.68 - 1558.44] it's one of them but think about that
[1556.56 - 1559.68] there's plenty of sugar in the avocado
[1558.44 - 1562.32] cuz that's what keeps you functioning
[1559.68 - 1565.20] it's that sugar and in that gluten-free
[1562.32 - 1567.84] toast it's sugar but don't eat a piece
[1565.20 - 1570.28] of fruit have that but never touch fruit
[1567.84 - 1573.00] oh it's bad because it's sugar fruit's
[1570.28 - 1575.12] sugar now and so don't touch a piece of
[1573.00 - 1577.36] fruit but have avocado toast which the
[1575.12 - 1579.60] toast is sugar basically straight sugar
[1577.36 - 1582.16] it's all sugar and then avocado which
[1579.60 - 1585.76] has sugar in it there is sugar in nuts
[1582.16 - 1588.20] and seeds too you guys your nut Butters
[1585.76 - 1590.20] peanut butter almond butter
[1588.20 - 1593.24] that sugar is what allows you to
[1590.20 - 1595.96] function it's not the fat allowing you
[1593.24 - 1598.04] to function and keeping your brain
[1595.96 - 1601.84] functioning but that's what someone
[1598.04 - 1604.32] wants you to believe that was planted
[1601.84 - 1607.32] quite a few years back you know one of
[1604.32 - 1610.60] the moles the plants the fruit demonizes
[1607.32 - 1612.48] paid for to actually distract people
[1610.60 - 1615.80] scare them out of fruit creating fruit
[1612.48 - 1618.16] fear along the way they were there for a
[1615.80 - 1621.56] reason to try to sabotage fruit this is
[1618.16 - 1624.28] the waron fruit the milk cheese butter
[1621.56 - 1626.88] yogurt kefir people eat it's all got
[1624.28 - 1630.04] sugar in it did you know that it's the
[1626.88 - 1632.60] lactose so here you are you're having
[1630.04 - 1634.56] your cheese you're having your milk
[1632.60 - 1637.44] you're having your butter you know
[1634.56 - 1640.88] Butter's got a sweet Edge to it it's all
[1637.44 - 1644.96] got sugar in it nut milks have sugar in
[1640.88 - 1647.04] it oat milk is sweet and they even add
[1644.96 - 1649.12] some sugar in it too so I see people
[1647.04 - 1650.28] they're like no I don't do fruit I won't
[1649.12 - 1652.00] touch any fruit and they're pouring
[1650.28 - 1655.32] their oatmeal milk you know from a
[1652.00 - 1657.36] container on their food and in the
[1655.32 - 1659.36] container it even says added sugar it's
[1657.36 - 1662.04] got like cane sugar in there added to
[1659.36 - 1664.60] their oat milk it's got like agave
[1662.04 - 1667.28] nectar added to the oat milk it's got
[1664.60 - 1670.96] like coconut sugar added like all kinds
[1667.28 - 1672.92] of things natural flavoring which is
[1670.96 - 1674.88] sugar too they put a little sugar in
[1672.92 - 1678.04] natural flavoring they're allowed to do
[1674.88 - 1682.12] that and and not say it so so it's like
[1678.04 - 1684.88] okay let's just pour sugar on top of my
[1682.12 - 1687.64] sugar and does that make any sense but
[1684.88 - 1690.52] never touch a piece of fruit because
[1687.64 - 1693.08] we're we're afraid of fruit We Exist
[1690.52 - 1695.48] because of sugar but most of those Foods
[1693.08 - 1699.40] I mentioned earlier don't even have
[1695.48 - 1702.52] enough of it or any antiviral compounds
[1699.40 - 1705.80] like I said antibacterial compounds
[1702.52 - 1708.08] antimicrobial compounds phytochemical
[1705.80 - 1710.40] compounds critical an
[1708.08 - 1713.36] antioxidants and immune building
[1710.40 - 1716.20] properties but fruit does what's
[1713.36 - 1719.48] interesting is we're being told not to
[1716.20 - 1721.56] eat fruit by people who don't know why
[1719.48 - 1724.64] we are sick so you walk around with a
[1721.56 - 1726.96] symptom you walk around with a condition
[1724.64 - 1729.92] and nobody knows why you're sick because
[1726.96 - 1732.20] research and science doesn't know and
[1729.92 - 1734.68] there's no answers to why you have a
[1732.20 - 1736.08] condition they just tag it as autoimmune
[1734.68 - 1738.48] or something but not give you any
[1736.08 - 1742.24] answers cause unknown that's the saddest
[1738.48 - 1744.84] part chronic illness is on the rise and
[1742.24 - 1749.00] it's not from the one banana someone
[1744.84 - 1752.20] eats a month or the one apple they eat
[1749.00 - 1754.16] every 3 months no one even eats fruit I
[1752.20 - 1756.40] mean I bet you guys like plenty of you
[1754.16 - 1758.60] out there listening right now don't even
[1756.40 - 1761.44] eat any fruit right I mean it's not on
[1758.60 - 1763.72] your radar and some people do and if
[1761.44 - 1766.36] they do they don't eat much at all and
[1763.72 - 1768.04] by the way the world is sitting in the
[1766.36 - 1770.24] dentist office chair
[1768.04 - 1773.12] right now getting their teeth drilled I
[1770.24 - 1776.72] mean that's the thing like our world
[1773.12 - 1779.44] that we live in now people by the Yeah
[1776.72 - 1781.20] billions are in you know they're in the
[1779.44 - 1784.44] dentist office and they're getting their
[1781.20 - 1787.44] teeth drilled and it's not because of
[1784.44 - 1790.56] fruit we could even argue it's because
[1787.44 - 1792.96] they are not eating enough fruit you
[1790.56 - 1794.88] know you might have had some fruit a
[1792.96 - 1797.60] moment in your life a little bit and
[1794.88 - 1799.48] then a dentist blamed a cavity on it but
[1797.60 - 1802.68] billions of people are not touching
[1799.48 - 1806.88] fruit and getting root canals implants
[1802.68 - 1810.12] teeth drilled Bridges all day long no
[1806.88 - 1813.96] matter what but fruit gets the blame the
[1810.12 - 1817.80] irony is is it gets the blame more than
[1813.96 - 1820.92] junkie sweets do right now like right
[1817.80 - 1823.64] now at this time we're in Fruit gets
[1820.92 - 1826.20] more blame for problems than junky
[1823.64 - 1828.00] sweets right now and chocolate Delights
[1826.20 - 1830.24] and cane sugar
[1828.00 - 1832.68] you guys eating chocolate but you're
[1830.24 - 1835.32] afraid of fruit I'm just wondering right
[1832.68 - 1837.00] there there's a lot of people I've seen
[1835.32 - 1838.28] out there and I talk to and stuff and
[1837.00 - 1840.32] people come to me are like hey I can't
[1838.28 - 1841.92] eat a piece of fruit but no no I'm doing
[1840.32 - 1843.16] my chocolate it's medicinal right I'm
[1841.92 - 1845.20] doing my chocolate you can still eat
[1843.16 - 1848.48] your healthy chocolate bar with Organic
[1845.20 - 1850.68] cane sugar or coconut sugar and do your
[1848.48 - 1853.60] Healthy organic cheat meals and
[1850.68 - 1856.60] self-care meals with coconut sugar cane
[1853.60 - 1859.16] sugar gluten-free grains and those
[1856.60 - 1861.40] sugars and chocolates won't get the
[1859.16 - 1863.48] blame ever they'll never get the blame
[1861.40 - 1868.08] now no way not with the war on fruit
[1863.48 - 1869.80] going on but fruit will H it's
[1868.08 - 1872.24] interesting right chewing that for a
[1869.80 - 1876.32] minute think about it you guys check
[1872.24 - 1879.60] this out the same people who sabotage
[1876.32 - 1882.72] fruit in the health industry back over a
[1879.60 - 1885.04] decade ago also
[1882.72 - 1888.20] simultaneously started pushing
[1885.04 - 1893.24] disinformation that are brain runs on
[1888.20 - 1896.76] fat not sugar it happened at the same
[1893.24 - 1899.28] time okay the same time same time the
[1896.76 - 1901.52] sabotage happened all right the
[1899.28 - 1904.44] propagandists and fruit demonizes the
[1901.52 - 1906.44] paid for people involved the moles and
[1904.44 - 1909.88] plants they did a
[1906.44 - 1914.68] Switcheroo fruit is bad but your brain
[1909.88 - 1917.76] runs on fat now the new rule no signs
[1914.68 - 1922.48] behind it just runs on fat now and and
[1917.76 - 1926.04] if we eat sugar we gain fat and fruit
[1922.48 - 1929.36] makes you gain fat is what they say
[1926.04 - 1932.20] interesting the same early crew that was
[1929.36 - 1935.40] planted by a dark industry and put
[1932.20 - 1939.48] people into Fruit fear also push the
[1935.40 - 1941.88] high fat Trend that defies Common Sense
[1939.48 - 1945.76] saying sugar from fruit makes you gain
[1941.88 - 1948.64] weight but all the fat you eat doesn't
[1945.76 - 1950.84] and you know what this add part is about
[1948.64 - 1953.08] that think about it other health
[1950.84 - 1956.12] professionals buy into it and then
[1953.08 - 1958.36] spread it around first of all people
[1956.12 - 1960.00] don't eat enough fruit that's not why
[1958.36 - 1962.84] they're gaining weight look come on
[1960.00 - 1966.40] let's be straight you've been tricked
[1962.84 - 1970.80] bottom line fat makes you gain fat in
[1966.40 - 1975.20] the end not fructose natural sugar
[1970.80 - 1979.68] that's in an apple a pear a watermelon a
[1975.20 - 1984.12] kiwi doesn't make you fat Okay a kiwi
[1979.68 - 1987.72] okay okay a kiwi is not going to make
[1984.12 - 1989.56] you fat but will what will make you gain
[1987.72 - 1992.04] weight is fatty
[1989.56 - 1994.40] meals you see right there so what will
[1992.04 - 1998.16] make you gain weight is the fatty meals
[1994.40 - 1999.92] that causes a stagnant sluggish liver
[1998.16 - 2003.24] medical medium information that put it
[1999.92 - 2005.24] out there okay quite a while is way back
[2003.24 - 2007.84] so it causes a stagnant sluggish liver
[2005.24 - 2009.40] when you're eating all those fatty meals
[2007.84 - 2012.04] that's all and your then your liver is
[2009.40 - 2014.84] already filled with Metals toxic heavy
[2012.04 - 2017.16] metals bugs fats from a lifetime of
[2014.84 - 2019.84] eating fatty foods of all kinds healthy
[2017.16 - 2021.84] or not healthy or not fats healthy fats
[2019.84 - 2024.08] or not and in each person the weight
[2021.84 - 2027.04] comes on at different times in their
[2024.08 - 2031.84] life because your liver has a tipping
[2027.04 - 2033.64] scale too that does before it gets sick
[2031.84 - 2036.80] and all of a sudden gets stagnant and
[2033.64 - 2038.84] sluggish depending on each person and
[2036.80 - 2041.16] get guess what all right come on let's
[2038.84 - 2043.80] be honest let's be honest with ourselves
[2041.16 - 2046.76] let's not me a denial about this fruit
[2043.80 - 2048.68] isn't doing it no one even eats fruit
[2046.76 - 2051.12] really and the amount of fruit they eat
[2048.68 - 2053.92] is really so small it's
[2051.12 - 2056.92] ridiculous it wasn't the sugar in a
[2053.92 - 2060.24] chocolate chip cookie or the blueberry
[2056.92 - 2064.00] in the blueberry muffin gluten-free or
[2060.24 - 2067.28] not that made you gain weight it was the
[2064.00 - 2071.32] fat in the food the oils in the cookie
[2067.28 - 2073.64] or muffin the fat in the eggs the fat in
[2071.32 - 2076.60] the chocolate yeah the fat in the
[2073.64 - 2079.64] chocolate the fat in the milk the fat in
[2076.60 - 2081.04] the butter the canola oil think about it
[2079.64 - 2083.48] you better work out in the gym two hours
[2081.04 - 2085.28] a day while you're young still young and
[2083.48 - 2087.04] feeling strong whatever and you just
[2085.28 - 2089.28] better be in the gym three hours a day
[2087.04 - 2091.04] so you can eat all that fat and you know
[2089.28 - 2093.24] and not touch fruit until finally it
[2091.04 - 2094.52] catches up to you and you know no matter
[2093.24 - 2096.20] how hard you work off you're just
[2094.52 - 2098.88] working out you're like what is this why
[2096.20 - 2098.88] am I gaining weight
[2098.96 - 2106.12] think about it any snack treat Delight
[2102.64 - 2109.28] gluten-free or not you have had has fat
[2106.12 - 2112.96] and sugar combined and no one is talking
[2109.28 - 2115.56] about that fact that it has fat and
[2112.96 - 2117.92] sugar combined they're acting like all
[2115.56 - 2121.00] is great all is great but don't eat that
[2117.92 - 2122.92] piece of fruit cuz it's sugar see where
[2121.00 - 2124.76] you're tricked out you see where you're
[2122.92 - 2127.68] tricked out you know I'm just being
[2124.76 - 2131.32] straight out honest because that you
[2127.68 - 2134.44] know yeah and each new generation of
[2131.32 - 2136.68] young adults whose parents made them
[2134.44 - 2138.16] scrambled eggs lovingly in the morning
[2136.68 - 2140.08] and then they went out for pizzas at
[2138.16 - 2143.04] night end up getting their first
[2140.08 - 2145.44] symptoms maybe some bloating maybe some
[2143.04 - 2147.96] acne maybe some eczema maybe some brain
[2145.44 - 2150.08] fog fatigue or a little weight gain
[2147.96 - 2152.56] listen to some health podcast out there
[2150.08 - 2156.08] and instantly get scared to death of
[2152.56 - 2158.36] fruit that's how it works so it's not
[2156.08 - 2161.96] doing the younger generation's Justice
[2158.36 - 2163.68] for sure cuz they just getting fed total
[2161.96 - 2166.52] misinformation and then they end up
[2163.68 - 2169.88] believing every ridiculous unfounded
[2166.52 - 2172.88] logic defying deception about fruit and
[2169.88 - 2175.64] then they Echo it that's how it's done
[2172.88 - 2178.36] and yes yeah they get taught to eat
[2175.64 - 2179.72] healthier sure right younger Generations
[2178.36 - 2181.32] now it's pretty amazing you get a
[2179.72 - 2184.76] symptom and you get taught to eat
[2181.32 - 2187.40] healthier like Whole Foods no gluten no
[2184.76 - 2190.48] processed food maybe balanced
[2187.40 - 2192.16] diet and now they're eating more eggs on
[2190.48 - 2195.08] their salads they're trying to do some
[2192.16 - 2197.16] food combining twists and turns and
[2195.08 - 2199.76] they're doing some fermented foods
[2197.16 - 2203.24] healthier oils cuz wow I heard this oil
[2199.76 - 2206.32] is healthy and avocado toast uh
[2203.24 - 2208.80] gluten-free toast protein shakes and
[2206.32 - 2212.76] sure it's an upgrade until they get
[2208.80 - 2215.08] sicker later or sick again later and
[2212.76 - 2217.12] they're still not eating
[2215.08 - 2218.72] fruit while there's while they're
[2217.12 - 2221.32] looking for the next diet belief system
[2218.72 - 2222.96] like where do I go what do I do I got a
[2221.32 - 2224.48] symptom I got another symptom I was
[2222.96 - 2226.68] doing good pretty good being off
[2224.48 - 2228.80] processed foods now where do I go I'll
[2226.68 - 2231.36] go plant-based no wait I'll go animal
[2228.80 - 2233.88] based which one do I jump into you know
[2231.36 - 2236.40] what's funny fruit is so
[2233.88 - 2239.36] demonized that you're encouraged to eat
[2236.40 - 2241.64] cacao with caffeine in it which tastes
[2239.36 - 2246.20] awful on its own and add sugar to it to
[2241.64 - 2247.64] sweeten it and it's heralded as God so
[2246.20 - 2251.20] cacao
[2247.64 - 2253.20] right take sugar put it into it and no
[2251.20 - 2255.40] one talks about the added sugar
[2253.20 - 2257.96] everybody talks about fruit being crap
[2255.40 - 2261.36] fruit's crap it's sugar it's bad for you
[2257.96 - 2263.12] but Cacao is heralded as God see how
[2261.36 - 2264.96] Darkness works I'm not saying you can't
[2263.12 - 2267.60] have your chocolate I'm just saying the
[2264.96 - 2270.24] caffeine industry is even part of this
[2267.60 - 2272.56] whole gig all right but you're not
[2270.24 - 2276.08] allowed to pick a piece of fruit off a
[2272.56 - 2278.36] fruit tree and eat it God forbid or peel
[2276.08 - 2280.28] a nav Orange in front of someone you're
[2278.36 - 2281.92] going to be ostracized for that you're
[2280.28 - 2284.96] going to be totally ripped apart for
[2281.92 - 2288.16] that God forbid hypocrisy is off the
[2284.96 - 2291.80] charts man it is think about that look
[2288.16 - 2295.20] you guys check this out okay our brain
[2291.80 - 2297.84] runs on Sugar by the way if you eat
[2295.20 - 2301.20] brain which maybe some of you have tried
[2297.84 - 2304.52] Brain before because it's you could if
[2301.20 - 2307.92] you eat brain you'll notice it's sweet
[2304.52 - 2311.40] creamy sweet and a little
[2307.92 - 2314.80] salty interesting a little salty too
[2311.40 - 2318.80] it's hardened glycogen that is a
[2314.80 - 2321.88] carbohydrate your brain is a hardened
[2318.80 - 2323.76] carbohydrate kind of like a sweet potato
[2321.88 - 2326.84] with some with some mineral salts in
[2323.76 - 2328.96] there it's hardened carbohydrates still
[2326.84 - 2331.36] kind of soft and to some degree but
[2328.96 - 2334.40] hardened and it takes like a it tastes
[2331.36 - 2337.04] like banana and a celery stick together
[2334.40 - 2339.52] the brain tastes like a banana and
[2337.04 - 2341.04] celery stick together like why would I
[2339.52 - 2343.16] know that I've talked to people who have
[2341.04 - 2344.32] eaten brain okay and I've talked to a
[2343.16 - 2346.08] lot of people over the years that have
[2344.32 - 2348.12] eaten brain and they're like well I kind
[2346.08 - 2350.24] of like it it's a delicacy because I've
[2348.12 - 2352.28] talked to people all over the world for
[2350.24 - 2355.52] years and years and years thousands upon
[2352.28 - 2357.12] thousands over the years and I would say
[2355.52 - 2359.52] well and they would ask me well how can
[2357.12 - 2361.32] I simulate this brain flavor since it's
[2359.52 - 2363.84] not a good idea that I'm eating
[2361.32 - 2366.56] brains of different animals and I'd say
[2363.84 - 2368.56] well put celery sticks and you know make
[2366.56 - 2370.20] a banana salad celeries celery sticks
[2368.56 - 2373.08] and bananas together kind of mix it
[2370.20 - 2375.76] together and see what you think and the
[2373.08 - 2378.84] consensus was always it's so close to
[2375.76 - 2382.36] brain so close to The Taste there's a
[2378.84 - 2383.04] reason because a banana has tiny amounts
[2382.36 - 2387.96] of
[2383.04 - 2391.00] Omega-3 right and lots of sugar okay and
[2387.96 - 2394.04] then the celery has got those mineral
[2391.00 - 2397.52] salts and that is the
[2394.04 - 2400.28] combination your brain is made out of
[2397.52 - 2402.84] mostly sugar that's glycogen stored
[2400.28 - 2405.08] glycogen tiny amounts of Omega-3 and
[2402.84 - 2407.40] lots of mineral salts okay and those
[2405.08 - 2409.68] mineral salts help feed your
[2407.40 - 2413.08] neurotransmitters some varieties of of
[2409.68 - 2417.08] Omega-3 that our body even produces
[2413.08 - 2419.64] itself from a healthy liver will be in
[2417.08 - 2421.64] your brain but that's only a tiny bit
[2419.64 - 2423.40] compared to the glycogen level I'm
[2421.64 - 2426.00] talking about the stored
[2423.40 - 2428.12] carbohydrate our brains heat up when we
[2426.00 - 2429.80] think are you thinking now like are you
[2428.12 - 2432.84] thinking like hey should I eat a piece
[2429.80 - 2435.24] of fruit like should I think about it is
[2432.84 - 2436.92] what should I do well electricity is
[2435.24 - 2438.40] spinning around right now electrical
[2436.92 - 2441.52] impulses are going around in your brain
[2438.40 - 2444.00] right now and our brain needs a vast
[2441.52 - 2446.20] amount of sugar which is glucose in
[2444.00 - 2448.84] order to keep it cool you get a breakup
[2446.20 - 2451.72] in a relationship your boyfriend you
[2448.84 - 2453.84] know cheats or your girlfriend doesn't
[2451.72 - 2456.36] want to be with you anymore or something
[2453.84 - 2459.92] happens you go into a shock your brain
[2456.36 - 2461.56] goes in the shock and or you you have a
[2459.92 - 2464.00] you have a relationship issue of any
[2461.56 - 2466.80] kind or any kind of trauma that's what
[2464.00 - 2468.72] happens and you need those electrical
[2466.80 - 2470.72] impulses to be working electricity off
[2468.72 - 2473.60] sudden fires up and goes crazy when that
[2470.72 - 2476.12] happens and our our brain needs a vast
[2473.60 - 2479.28] amount of sugar which is glucose in
[2476.12 - 2482.16] order to keep it cool kind of like
[2479.28 - 2485.08] antifreeze to a car engine antifreeze is
[2482.16 - 2486.76] Sy synthetically sweet it cools the
[2485.08 - 2489.40] engine down
[2486.76 - 2492.12] don't ever drink it God forbid but the
[2489.40 - 2498.04] sugar cools heat see how it works sugar
[2492.12 - 2502.64] cools heat not fat fat creates more heat
[2498.04 - 2507.56] sugar cools heat fat creates more heat
[2502.64 - 2510.56] so if your brain was all about fat it
[2507.56 - 2512.96] lives all fat whatever you know it's all
[2510.56 - 2516.76] made out of fat however it goes it's
[2512.96 - 2518.56] going to overheat overheat and and what
[2516.76 - 2520.20] happens is this is why instinctively
[2518.56 - 2522.08] when you have a stressful event I was
[2520.20 - 2525.76] mentioning before like a breakup or any
[2522.08 - 2528.24] kind of trauma you crave something sweet
[2525.76 - 2529.92] afterwards like ice cream that's one
[2528.24 - 2531.84] thing right there after a breakup
[2529.92 - 2534.28] relationship breakup that's a big one
[2531.84 - 2538.08] all in its own I've heard it a thousand
[2534.28 - 2542.52] times I need my ice cream like every day
[2538.08 - 2544.76] you know the reason is glucose sugar
[2542.52 - 2547.72] stops your brain from
[2544.76 - 2551.32] overheating and burning up and getting
[2547.72 - 2554.44] damaged and even mild tiny Strokes that
[2551.32 - 2556.84] are undetectable from being that upset
[2554.44 - 2559.88] after your brain goes into a electrical
[2556.84 - 2561.40] storm of trauma when you see that
[2559.88 - 2563.40] breakup message on your phone you're
[2561.40 - 2566.16] like oh my God what is this I can't
[2563.40 - 2568.44] believe this right or you get that news
[2566.16 - 2570.36] like you're getting a divorce boom those
[2568.44 - 2571.96] neurotransmitters they're like firing up
[2570.36 - 2574.20] they're like burning up they're like
[2571.96 - 2576.36] just falling apart left and right those
[2574.20 - 2578.52] neurotransmitters just just like going
[2576.36 - 2580.36] left and right and you don't have enough
[2578.52 - 2582.36] glucose your blood sugar isn't
[2580.36 - 2584.64] stabilized for that you don't have that
[2582.36 - 2586.68] storage been in the brain I mean you
[2584.64 - 2590.76] could suffer greatly with all kinds of
[2586.68 - 2592.92] afterwards PTSD trauma injury you know
[2590.76 - 2595.20] look you'll hear okay check this out
[2592.92 - 2598.12] right now this is a whole another thing

[2725.04 - 2728.68] all the time
[2726.40 - 2730.88] the sugar aspect is what allows you to
[2728.68 - 2732.72] function out of all those Foods I just
[2730.88 - 2735.36] mentioned you crave or that you want to
[2732.72 - 2739.00] eat but God forbid you touch a piece of
[2735.36 - 2741.96] fruit I mean for real and then you top
[2739.00 - 2744.36] it off all that food you top it off with
[2741.96 - 2746.00] what you believe might be a sweet that's
[2744.36 - 2749.00] kind of on the edge and a little off the
[2746.00 - 2752.80] chart like some ice cream or chocolate
[2749.00 - 2755.60] in your diet okay so do you drink coffee
[2752.80 - 2758.88] you put your oat milk or dairy or soy
[2755.60 - 2761.08] cream steamer or nutmilk in your coffee
[2758.88 - 2763.12] that's all sugar but you won't eat a
[2761.08 - 2766.92] piece of fruit in the morning cuz you're
[2763.12 - 2770.20] scared all these milks have sugar in
[2766.92 - 2772.52] them so think about this next time you
[2770.20 - 2776.28] hear someone say you don't crave sugar
[2772.52 - 2778.24] like you what's funny next time you know
[2776.28 - 2780.20] you tell somebody out there I don't
[2778.24 - 2781.64] crave sugar just think about that a
[2780.20 - 2783.52] little bit and next time you hear
[2781.64 - 2785.24] somebody tell you that like I don't
[2783.52 - 2786.60] crave sugar like the if they're out
[2785.24 - 2789.40] there or you watch somebody's YouTube I
[2786.60 - 2791.80] don't crave sugar okay sure and if you
[2789.40 - 2794.64] believe that you've been stupified
[2791.80 - 2796.52] tricked by not smart
[2794.64 - 2798.40] information and then you know it's
[2796.52 - 2800.52] everybody's smart I mean it's not about
[2798.40 - 2802.96] that it's about the information being
[2800.52 - 2805.08] not smart that's you have to see it
[2802.96 - 2807.16] because that's what it is and people get
[2805.08 - 2809.08] stupified all along I mean all around
[2807.16 - 2812.52] it's like all you hear out there I don't
[2809.08 - 2815.00] crave sweets I don't crave sweets oh man
[2812.52 - 2818.60] meanwhile everything they're eating is
[2815.00 - 2821.68] packed with sugar and it could be a slow
[2818.60 - 2823.92] burn like oats sure Slow Burn
[2821.68 - 2826.96] carbohydrate still sugar that's what
[2823.92 - 2830.32] you're living off of or a faster burn
[2826.96 - 2832.80] it's still sugar it's all the same in
[2830.32 - 2837.08] many ways actually in every way when it
[2832.80 - 2840.88] enters your cells and fat doesn't enter
[2837.08 - 2844.32] your cells from your blood and become
[2840.88 - 2846.08] energy that's a farce do they call it
[2844.32 - 2848.08] blood fat are they measuring that every
[2846.08 - 2850.20] time you go into the the doctor's office
[2848.08 - 2852.80] well we better check your blood fat we
[2850.20 - 2855.24] better make sure no because that's not
[2852.80 - 2858.00] what keeps you alive they're not
[2855.24 - 2861.40] measuring your blood fat it's your blood
[2858.00 - 2866.12] sugar they're measuring we need sugar to
[2861.40 - 2870.68] survive it's what our cells run on sugar
[2866.12 - 2875.36] has to attach itself to insulin to get
[2870.68 - 2878.48] into our cells to Keep Us Alive the fat
[2875.36 - 2880.72] doesn't attach itself to insulin and go
[2878.48 - 2883.68] into our cells where the heck does it go
[2880.72 - 2887.72] then that's what I'm trying to say the
[2883.68 - 2889.84] fat actually doesn't enter your cells
[2887.72 - 2892.80] interesting it's not its job it's not
[2889.84 - 2894.44] attaching to insulin so they're not like
[2892.80 - 2897.24] you go to doctor's office let me check
[2894.44 - 2900.76] your uh blood fat oh where is it at hm
[2897.24 - 2902.40] too fat too too high too low um what's
[2900.76 - 2905.88] going on nothing it's not even on
[2902.40 - 2908.28] anybody's radar but fat gets in the way
[2905.88 - 2911.44] of sugar entering your cell so it gets
[2908.28 - 2913.20] in the way it's a menace I'm not saying
[2911.44 - 2915.24] you can't eat any healthy fats it's not
[2913.20 - 2916.80] it at all I'm just saying are you ever
[2915.24 - 2918.80] going to eat a piece of fruit or are you
[2916.80 - 2921.64] just going to stay scared scared scared
[2918.80 - 2923.56] stay sick sick sick misinformation
[2921.64 - 2927.44] disinformation never touch a piece of
[2923.56 - 2930.12] fruit and just get you know exactly so
[2927.44 - 2934.68] insulin resistance occurs from the fat
[2930.12 - 2937.48] and the sugar combined right but fruit
[2934.68 - 2939.96] does not cause insulin
[2937.48 - 2942.88] resistance you have been taught that
[2939.96 - 2944.92] your oatmeal is a slow burn okay you
[2942.88 - 2947.16] probably heard that like no it's a slow
[2944.92 - 2949.04] burn it's it's you know it makes it it
[2947.16 - 2951.24] last it sustains you and you've
[2949.04 - 2953.80] experienced that yourself it's like and
[2951.24 - 2955.80] oh oats are okay I'm not anti oats but
[2953.80 - 2959.04] you've experienced it yourself it
[2955.80 - 2961.52] sustains you for many hours when maybe
[2959.04 - 2964.52] you tried one or two pieces of fruit on
[2961.52 - 2966.08] its own and you got hungry fast and felt
[2964.52 - 2968.12] like it wasn't getting you through the
[2966.08 - 2970.24] day or getting you through the morning
[2968.12 - 2973.56] because you didn't eat enough fruit
[2970.24 - 2976.88] because it's not that high in calorie in
[2973.56 - 2979.12] fact it's not even high in calories and
[2976.88 - 2981.52] that's one of the mistakes there's not
[2979.12 - 2984.68] even a lot of sugar in fruit that's the
[2981.52 - 2986.88] irony and you know and what you're not
[2984.68 - 2990.80] realizing is that when you eat your
[2986.88 - 2993.72] oatmeal you probably added fat to it
[2990.80 - 2995.28] which also increases your calories you
[2993.72 - 2997.16] threw the nut Butters in there you threw
[2995.28 - 2999.68] the avocado I see people throw avocado
[2997.16 - 3003.48] in their in their oatmeal you stick milk
[2999.68 - 3007.04] in there nut milks nuts nut Butters
[3003.48 - 3009.08] coconut cacao almonds soy you add that
[3007.04 - 3012.76] to your oatmeal so now you have this
[3009.08 - 3015.80] really high dense dense caloric meal
[3012.76 - 3018.52] with a ton of fat on top of it mixed
[3015.80 - 3021.08] with sugar and you think you found the
[3018.52 - 3022.48] perfect meal when you're you know hey if
[3021.08 - 3024.08] you're not really sick or you don't have
[3022.48 - 3026.84] a lot of symptoms you got nothing going
[3024.08 - 3028.72] on yeah it feels like a perfect meal but
[3026.84 - 3030.96] now you have a problem you don't know
[3028.72 - 3036.24] about though that's going to bite you
[3030.96 - 3039.32] over time and it's insulin resistance
[3036.24 - 3041.20] that sits there and goes long sustaining
[3039.32 - 3043.88] so you have this long sustaining insulin
[3041.20 - 3046.96] resistance that catches up to you over
[3043.88 - 3048.88] time and eventually you have to then
[3046.96 - 3050.36] learn how to intermittent fast so now
[3048.88 - 3052.84] you're 25 years old and is like well I'm
[3050.36 - 3056.72] intermittent fasting now I have to not
[3052.84 - 3059.88] eat at all all morning all afternoon and
[3056.72 - 3061.92] try to exercise and stimulate on coffee
[3059.88 - 3064.08] drinks I got to I I have to intermittent
[3061.92 - 3066.20] fast now because you're putting the
[3064.08 - 3067.76] weight on you're seeing like a pound
[3066.20 - 3070.24] come on you're like oh my God that's my
[3067.76 - 3071.88] first pound that's my first pound I've
[3070.24 - 3074.80] ever seen why am I getting a couple of
[3071.88 - 3076.92] pounds on me I exercise um I'm eating
[3074.80 - 3078.84] healthy meals I'm doing my peanut butter
[3076.92 - 3081.36] butter smoothie bowls and oatmeal with
[3078.84 - 3083.16] nut Butters and I'm doing all that
[3081.36 - 3086.04] having avocado toast in the morning
[3083.16 - 3087.76] maybe I should intermittent fast and and
[3086.04 - 3090.72] and that's what people do so now they're
[3087.76 - 3092.36] doing that and maybe you get a little
[3090.72 - 3095.24] bit of low energy or a little bit of
[3092.36 - 3096.72] brain fog and if you're putting on a
[3095.24 - 3099.80] little weight and you're like okay
[3096.72 - 3101.88] intermittent fasting time and guess what
[3099.80 - 3104.08] all these things going wrong putting on
[3101.88 - 3106.92] a little bit of weight a couple extra
[3104.08 - 3110.16] pounds getting a little brain fog little
[3106.92 - 3113.16] acne starts kicking in or anything like
[3110.16 - 3115.56] that low energy it's not because of the
[3113.16 - 3117.84] fruit it's not because of a few few
[3115.56 - 3120.08] berries you might have thrown on one of
[3117.84 - 3123.80] your oatmeal
[3120.08 - 3125.76] bowls or you know or maybe a piece of
[3123.80 - 3127.84] banana or a half a banana you threw on
[3125.76 - 3131.04] an oatmeal Bowl it's not going to be
[3127.84 - 3134.44] that the underlying insulin resistance
[3131.04 - 3137.76] and stagnant sluggish liver caught up to
[3134.44 - 3140.32] you so you stop your oatmeal Bowls in
[3137.76 - 3143.12] the morning you stop your avocado toast
[3140.32 - 3145.36] in the morning you stop your eggs in the
[3143.12 - 3148.48] morning yeah you stop your eggs in in
[3145.36 - 3151.36] the morning and then everybody has to
[3148.48 - 3154.56] eventually intermittent fast and the
[3151.36 - 3158.00] only reason it seems to help is because
[3154.56 - 3161.68] you gave your body a break from eating
[3158.00 - 3166.32] fats for most of the day you went fat
[3161.68 - 3169.32] free by default without realizing it by
[3166.32 - 3172.40] accident without anybody knowing or
[3169.32 - 3174.80] realizing it it has nothing to do with
[3172.40 - 3177.24] fruit and that's just one thing that has
[3174.80 - 3178.96] nothing to to do with fruit everything
[3177.24 - 3181.68] has nothing to do with fruit that goes
[3178.96 - 3183.44] wrong and eventually your intermittent
[3181.68 - 3186.60] fasting doesn't seem to work anymore
[3183.44 - 3189.40] either later on because you get these
[3186.60 - 3191.28] cravings and you still have insulin
[3189.40 - 3194.48] resistance because you're still eating
[3191.28 - 3198.20] fats at the end of the day and you never
[3194.48 - 3201.80] know how to escape it and you don't know
[3198.20 - 3206.28] you even have it the insulin resistance
[3201.80 - 3209.68] and still you stay away from fruit
[3206.28 - 3213.04] unbelievable but you still cheat on
[3209.68 - 3215.84] pizza ice cream whether it's plant-based
[3213.04 - 3218.36] or animal-based so you swing from
[3215.84 - 3220.88] craving to craving and then holistic
[3218.36 - 3222.28] doctor to doctor and guess what you get

[3233.28 - 3236.88] day people aren't even eating fruit but
[3235.16 - 3238.56] they remember eating a piece of Apple
[3236.88 - 3240.20] like or they remember eating half an
[3238.56 - 3241.88] Apple 4 days ago and they're at the
[3240.20 - 3243.64] doctor's office and their holistic
[3241.88 - 3245.32] doctor's like stay off of fruit that's
[3243.64 - 3247.32] number one that's your problem here oh
[3245.32 - 3251.12] whoa as if you're eating fruit all day
[3247.32 - 3253.88] long but what's crazy is everyone who
[3251.12 - 3255.32] gets sick for the first time never
[3253.88 - 3258.72] really ate
[3255.32 - 3261.80] fruit how much fruit did you guys eat
[3258.72 - 3264.28] before you first got sick and if you did
[3261.80 - 3265.76] eat a lot of fruit you're a rarity I'm
[3264.28 - 3268.96] talking like a RAR
[3265.76 - 3271.24] think about it when someone first gets
[3268.96 - 3274.48] sick and they start to clean up their
[3271.24 - 3276.80] diet and try fruit more they instantly
[3274.48 - 3278.76] get told to stop either through
[3276.80 - 3281.64] something they see either through you
[3278.76 - 3283.12] know a podcast they heard you know from
[3281.64 - 3285.48] a professional being on a podcast
[3283.12 - 3287.76] telling you stay away from fruit do low
[3285.48 - 3290.44] glycemic or don't do none at all
[3287.76 - 3293.76] claiming it's going to make you sicker
[3290.44 - 3297.48] when the person already got sick before
[3293.76 - 3300.40] eating the fruit and now the person is
[3297.48 - 3303.32] afraid of fruit because of anti-f fruit
[3300.40 - 3307.08] propaganda and misinformation without
[3303.32 - 3310.80] anybody realizing it the very thing they
[3307.08 - 3313.00] never ate the fruit was medicine so
[3310.80 - 3315.64] without realizing it you guys the very
[3313.00 - 3317.80] thing no one ever even ate was their
[3315.64 - 3320.24] medicinals was their
[3317.80 - 3322.80] medicine they just didn't know how to
[3320.24 - 3327.60] use it as a healing
[3322.80 - 3330.48] tool you must learn how to use it
[3327.60 - 3332.16] properly so when you try the medicine a
[3330.48 - 3333.64] piece of fruit it scares them because
[3332.16 - 3335.88] you don't know how to use it and that's
[3333.64 - 3337.32] what happens you know it's like a lot of
[3335.88 - 3338.80] things it's like anything if you don't
[3337.32 - 3341.64] know how to do something or you don't
[3338.80 - 3345.00] know how to use something and understand
[3341.64 - 3348.00] its power or what it holds or what it
[3345.00 - 3351.00] does it scares you you don't use it
[3348.00 - 3352.56] right no one teaches you and right now
[3351.00 - 3354.52] in this world no one wants to teach you
[3352.56 - 3356.52] how to use a piece of fruit no way they
[3354.52 - 3359.08] want the opposite they want to scare you
[3356.52 - 3362.28] scare you out of it and that's the whole
[3359.08 - 3364.32] thing they are they they are told the
[3362.28 - 3366.48] fructose is bad for them that's what
[3364.32 - 3370.00] everybody gets told by Health experts
[3366.48 - 3372.20] it's like fructose it's a scary word Now
[3370.00 - 3374.84] by Health experts who don't know why
[3372.20 - 3377.76] they're sick to begin with meanwhile the
[3374.84 - 3380.08] fruit is medicine when you are eating
[3377.76 - 3383.52] cleansing fruits and they are dropping
[3380.08 - 3386.56] into a dirty environment your
[3383.52 - 3390.08] body that's the dirty environment stuff
[3386.56 - 3392.60] starts flying crap hits the fan the
[3390.08 - 3395.48] fruit is house cleaning it's cleaning
[3392.60 - 3398.08] your toilet the fruit is cleaning your
[3395.48 - 3400.32] toilet bottom line it's cleaning the bad
[3398.08 - 3403.44] inside of you all the sludge that's
[3400.32 - 3406.32] built up in your gallbladder the fruit
[3403.44 - 3409.04] is sweeping out bugs that colonized in
[3406.32 - 3412.00] your gut and liver for years that's what
[3409.04 - 3413.92] the fruit is sweeping out the bacteria
[3412.00 - 3417.08] in your small intestinal tract it's
[3413.92 - 3419.28] helping to dis olve rancid fats and
[3417.08 - 3422.00] rotting proteins in the lining of the
[3419.28 - 3425.16] intestinal tract and colon and
[3422.00 - 3429.08] dadum it's helping to detox your liver
[3425.16 - 3431.80] of all the poisons and helping to starve
[3429.08 - 3435.24] viruses and then if you're still dumping
[3431.80 - 3437.84] in eggs dairy too many nut Butters lots
[3435.24 - 3440.60] of chicken right down the pike and then
[3437.84 - 3442.28] throwing fruit on top of it that fruit
[3440.60 - 3444.92] you're dropping down is going to be like
[3442.28 - 3447.36] oh my God this is a serious mess right
[3444.92 - 3449.92] right here and there's going to be a
[3447.36 - 3452.28] large conflict going on in here a larger
[3449.92 - 3454.68] conflict of interest because the fruit
[3452.28 - 3458.68] is going to have to try to clean up a
[3454.68 - 3462.56] mess on top of a new mess it wants to
[3458.68 - 3465.28] digest fast and push out all the bad and
[3462.56 - 3468.16] then it gets misconstrued as fruit being
[3465.28 - 3471.96] the problem instead of your dirty system
[3468.16 - 3474.52] that's a mess so the messenger gets shot
[3471.96 - 3476.48] you got a mess inside of you there's a
[3474.52 - 3478.76] whole bunch of dirty going on inside
[3476.48 - 3481.60] there like a whole bunch of sludge all
[3478.76 - 3484.04] kinds of bugs all kinds of troublemakers
[3481.60 - 3487.36] and you drop fruit in there to clean
[3484.04 - 3490.16] that mess and the messenger gets shot
[3487.36 - 3492.12] it's fruit and it's that you know it's
[3490.16 - 3494.16] the Apple the banana the mango the
[3492.12 - 3497.12] orange the peach one time a year and the
[3494.16 - 3499.56] melon that didn't do any harm and it
[3497.12 - 3502.84] didn't do any wrong it's only there to
[3499.56 - 3504.32] help you and you shoot it in the back
[3502.84 - 3507.04] you shoot the messenger in the back you
[3504.32 - 3509.60] don't even give it a blindfold or its
[3507.04 - 3512.20] last cigarette meanwhile these fruit
[3509.60 - 3515.64] haters and fruit demonizes don't know
[3512.20 - 3518.88] how to even eat fruit and I know because
[3515.64 - 3521.04] I actually talked to one many years ago
[3518.88 - 3523.08] that was also onto the bandwagon of
[3521.04 - 3525.84] trying to destroy fruit create the war
[3523.08 - 3528.84] on fruit and I said do you even know how
[3525.84 - 3531.00] to use fruit or eat fruit and they just
[3528.84 - 3533.48] knew that you cut a grapefruit in half
[3531.00 - 3535.76] and you try to cut the little squares
[3533.48 - 3538.64] out the triangles out that was the most
[3535.76 - 3540.92] they knew and from what I heard talking
[3538.64 - 3542.76] to this one person this professional
[3540.92 - 3545.80] they were putting sugar on top of their
[3542.76 - 3548.08] great fruit on top of it and fruit they
[3545.80 - 3549.92] didn't even know how to eat it or didn't
[3548.08 - 3553.16] even know what kind of fruits were out
[3549.92 - 3557.36] there but fruits evil totally evil it's
[3553.16 - 3561.88] unbelievable so look and there's
[3557.36 - 3564.24] therapeutic nature to these fruits and
[3561.88 - 3566.64] that's the power that's within him so
[3564.24 - 3570.72] that he healing happens all around
[3566.64 - 3573.52] inside our bodies fruit can be used
[3570.72 - 3577.60] therapeutically you know and when you
[3573.52 - 3581.00] align other therapeutic foods with fruit
[3577.60 - 3583.68] extra healing occurs so then there's a
[3581.00 - 3585.36] crowd that's sick for the first time you
[3583.68 - 3586.76] guys hear this all the time maybe out
[3585.36 - 3588.16] there you get the crowd that's sick for
[3586.76 - 3590.88] the first time maybe they got a little
[3588.16 - 3594.12] bloating maybe a little weight gain
[3590.88 - 3596.52] maybe some acne a little eczema and they
[3594.12 - 3599.08] never really eat fruit and don't start
[3596.52 - 3601.16] eating it either sure they get rid of
[3599.08 - 3604.04] their processed foods you know they're
[3601.16 - 3606.52] eating healthier fats which is which is
[3604.04 - 3609.04] good they're eating vegetables they may
[3606.52 - 3611.44] see an improvement in their symptoms
[3609.04 - 3615.12] maybe they throw in a few berries some
[3611.44 - 3618.80] assai told to stay off sugar but still
[3615.12 - 3620.32] eat sugar bad sugar and Grains
[3618.80 - 3623.76] especially on their cheat days or
[3620.32 - 3626.88] self-care days but they don't eat fruit
[3623.76 - 3629.88] or ever enough fruit and they hate on
[3626.88 - 3631.84] fruit and spread that hatred around like
[3629.88 - 3633.48] they just hate it they they'll just
[3631.84 - 3635.88] comment about it they'll talk about it
[3633.48 - 3638.24] they'll post about it they hate fruit
[3635.88 - 3639.92] even if it's done in a nice way like
[3638.24 - 3642.04] even if they it's done in a really nice
[3639.92 - 3644.08] thoughtful way like what seems to be
[3642.04 - 3646.88] kind of like a kind manner of what their
[3644.08 - 3648.88] experience is like someone will say
[3646.88 - 3650.96] everybody's different I'm different you
[3648.88 - 3654.20] know you it might work for you but it
[3650.96 - 3655.88] didn't work for me I tried fruit because
[3654.20 - 3657.96] of what what they learned from the
[3655.88 - 3660.44] health podcast out there the Talking
[3657.96 - 3663.00] Heads of health or that piece of fruit
[3660.44 - 3665.24] bothered my stomach and didn't make me
[3663.00 - 3667.52] feel right or something meanwhile that
[3665.24 - 3669.24] piece of fruit just dropped into a dirty
[3667.52 - 3672.56] environment and it's trying to clean up
[3669.24 - 3674.44] the mess and no one understands cuz when
[3672.56 - 3675.92] like I said they listen to maybe a
[3674.44 - 3677.84] health podcast or something like that
[3675.92 - 3679.64] that fruit is bad they instantly just
[3677.84 - 3681.52] all of a sudden go with it they get
[3679.64 - 3683.52] suckered into it and they listen to the
[3681.52 - 3686.16] talking heads out there that just want
[3683.52 - 3689.48] to climb the ego ladder in health rip
[3686.16 - 3691.56] rip down fruit on social media Health
[3689.48 - 3693.96] experts spreading the same tricks and
[3691.56 - 3697.56] game that was originally planted by the
[3693.96 - 3700.48] industries to start the war on fruit and
[3697.56 - 3702.92] we get suckered into it and we lose
[3700.48 - 3706.00] something that was really going to help
[3702.92 - 3708.64] us but we didn't understand it we just
[3706.00 - 3710.72] didn't understand it and it was actually
[3708.64 - 3713.08] going to be a Saving Grace for the
[3710.72 - 3715.08] future if you get sicker down the road
[3713.08 - 3717.80] you know you'll hear things like like
[3715.08 - 3720.28] some low glycemic fruit is okay but
[3717.80 - 3722.04] overall fruit is bad you know it's too
[3720.28 - 3725.28] sweet and then there's the people who
[3722.04 - 3727.72] never even ate fruit got sick tried a
[3725.28 - 3729.24] piece of fruit and they're still sick
[3727.72 - 3732.52] because they don't know the cause of
[3729.24 - 3734.80] their symptoms and how they got sick and
[3732.52 - 3738.80] why they're still sick they blame it on
[3734.80 - 3741.12] fruit though okay and maybe saying it
[3738.80 - 3743.68] made me sick when I tried it it gave me
[3741.12 - 3745.88] that tummy ache fruit always gets the
[3743.68 - 3748.92] blame aren't you glad you're not a piece
[3745.88 - 3751.68] of fruit shunned alienated
[3748.92 - 3754.24] underappreciated undervalued shot in the
[3751.68 - 3755.84] back maybe some of you guys can relate
[3754.24 - 3758.68] and with other things in your life or
[3755.84 - 3761.96] something you know chronic illness is on
[3758.68 - 3766.20] the rise like never before and no one
[3761.96 - 3769.52] eats fruit pretty much no one eats fruit
[3766.20 - 3771.32] and fruit gets the blame neurological
[3769.52 - 3773.60] symptoms are on the rise like never
[3771.32 - 3777.68] before in history anxiety do you have
[3773.60 - 3779.32] anxiety depression Lyme disease vertigo
[3777.68 - 3782.12] tunitis I'm all I'm going to do future
[3779.32 - 3785.12] shows on all those so I hope you listen
[3782.12 - 3788.40] neuropathy focus in concentration brain
[3785.12 - 3790.88] fog migraines head pain neck pain back
[3788.40 - 3793.16] pain joint pain that's
[3790.88 - 3796.36] mysterious which we'll cover you know in
[3793.16 - 3800.16] upcoming episodes these are all nervous
[3796.36 - 3802.88] symptom conditions nervous system
[3800.16 - 3805.64] conditions and symptoms and people with
[3802.88 - 3808.96] these symptoms didn't get sick because
[3805.64 - 3812.64] of eating fruit they didn't eat any
[3808.96 - 3815.20] fruit practically nobody does but what
[3812.64 - 3817.28] you need to know is an important part of
[3815.20 - 3820.88] recovery from these neurological
[3817.28 - 3822.52] symptoms that I just mentioned requires
[3820.88 - 3827.16] consistent
[3822.52 - 3831.24] uninterrupted levels of glucose sugar
[3827.16 - 3834.40] from a natural source sugar from
[3831.24 - 3837.92] fruit because your nervous system is
[3834.40 - 3841.52] made up of nerve cells you guys nerve
[3837.92 - 3843.56] cells exist on sugar whether anybody
[3841.52 - 3845.48] likes it or not I should say it again
[3843.56 - 3847.76] all those nervous system conditions your
[3845.48 - 3849.60] Vagas nerve causing all these different
[3847.76 - 3851.48] problems people don't even know about
[3849.60 - 3853.16] like medical medum information of what
[3851.48 - 3857.32] what causes what in your your Vegas
[3853.16 - 3859.60] nerve it needs sugar to exist that's
[3857.32 - 3862.68] what the nerve cells are made up of they
[3859.60 - 3865.92] draw it in they need it
[3862.68 - 3867.96] desperately meanwhile fruit is a way for
[3865.92 - 3871.52] these people with neurological symptoms
[3867.96 - 3876.32] to recover and heal and it's kept from
[3871.52 - 3879.24] them on purpose by the industries and by
[3876.32 - 3881.80] accident by well-meaning practitioners
[3879.24 - 3884.56] and influencers who are you know who are
[3881.80 - 3886.76] well-meaning and doing cool things but
[3884.56 - 3889.24] don't know why they have stomach pain
[3886.76 - 3892.84] and bloating and gastritis
[3889.24 - 3895.40] hypoglycemia acne fatigue eczema weight
[3892.84 - 3899.56] gain anxiety and don't know how to use

[3911.84 - 3916.60] anti-aging as if that's an answer for
[3914.32 - 3919.04] why a 20-year-old can't get out of bed
[3916.60 - 3922.28] and has severe neurological fatigue and

[3966.56 - 3971.84] embarrassing and the sad part is
[3969.12 - 3975.40] anti-aging experts don't even know why
[3971.84 - 3977.76] anybody is sick they don't know why the
[3975.40 - 3981.52] 25-year-old like can't do anything
[3977.76 - 3983.76] function laying in bed fatigue headaches
[3981.52 - 3985.52] migraines floaters in the eyes and
[3983.76 - 3987.32] they're anti-aging experts and they're
[3985.52 - 3989.52] on the circuit like they have all the
[3987.32 - 3992.60] answers you know that's bad enough to
[3989.52 - 3996.12] begin with as it is all of it aging
[3992.60 - 4000.20] means we're oxidizing oxidizing means
[3996.12 - 4002.52] our cells die the question is how fast
[4000.20 - 4005.40] are we oxidizing and what causes the
[4002.52 - 4008.12] oxidizing I'll give you a hint we have
[4005.40 - 4009.44] toxins pathogens in us more than every
[4008.12 - 4011.64] before in a history I've been talking
[4009.44 - 4013.80] about it for 35 years I call them
[4011.64 - 4015.76] troublemakers take for and think about
[4013.80 - 4017.96] this toxic stuff right here take for
[4015.76 - 4020.36] example air fresheners plug-in air
[4017.96 - 4023.28] fresheners colog perfumes conventional
[4020.36 - 4026.56] scented candles conventional cleaning
[4023.28 - 4028.96] supplies gasoline petrochemicals
[4026.56 - 4031.36] pesticides herbicides fungicides
[4028.96 - 4035.32] pathogens like Epstein bar shingles
[4031.36 - 4038.20] herpes simplex strep cyeg virus hhvs of
[4035.32 - 4041.08] all kinds and all their mutations and
[4038.20 - 4044.00] varieties and more and guess what you
[4041.08 - 4047.08] age fast with all of that and everybody
[4044.00 - 4051.04] is peppered with it all men and women
[4047.08 - 4053.12] are saturated with colog perfumes sended
[4051.04 - 4055.68] candles air fresheners and living with
[4053.12 - 4057.48] bugs pathogens inside of them and
[4055.68 - 4059.48] meanwhile they won't even touch a piece
[4057.48 - 4062.24] of fruit they get told don't touch a
[4059.48 - 4064.96] piece of fruit the very thing that's
[4062.24 - 4068.16] anti-aging one of the most powerful
[4064.96 - 4071.64] anti-aging tools and healing tools to
[4068.16 - 4075.12] get those aging troublemakers out of the
[4071.64 - 4078.68] body and prevent premature aging and the
[4075.12 - 4080.92] anti-aging clowns on the circuit they're
[4078.68 - 4084.20] all against fruit except maybe few
[4080.92 - 4088.92] berries or something or a green banana
[4084.20 - 4091.48] and or a green apple you know fruit has
[4088.92 - 4093.72] undiscovered antioxidants that are
[4091.48 - 4095.96] critical to our survival in today's
[4093.72 - 4100.20] world especially the stress all that
[4095.96 - 4103.56] stress and it's the largest array of
[4100.20 - 4107.16] antioxidants that is non-toxic in any
[4103.56 - 4109.52] way meaning you can get large amounts of
[4107.16 - 4112.24] undiscovered antioxid and a few
[4109.52 - 4114.96] discovered ones but large amounts of it
[4112.24 - 4118.68] without having to deal with toxic things
[4114.96 - 4122.92] involved in other Foods or other places
[4118.68 - 4124.88] you can find an antioxidant in caffeine
[4122.92 - 4127.12] right in a caffeine beverage but it
[4124.88 - 4128.76] comes with a price so there'll be all
[4127.12 - 4131.28] the science of research to protect the
[4128.76 - 4134.12] caffeine indust rate right and it'll be
[4131.28 - 4136.84] like let's find an antioxidant and in
[4134.12 - 4138.20] coffeee let's find it in some kind of
[4136.84 - 4140.60] caffeinated beverage let's find it in
[4138.20 - 4142.52] MCH tea let's find it in black tea let's
[4140.60 - 4144.48] find it in chocolate so all the science
[4142.52 - 4146.36] will be paid for for that to try to find
[4144.48 - 4148.36] that one antioxidant that two
[4146.36 - 4150.72] antioxidants and then they Herald that
[4148.36 - 4153.60] antioxidant like God like that's going
[4150.72 - 4156.96] to be your savior but no matter how much
[4153.60 - 4160.24] caffeinated beverage or cacao you eat
[4156.96 - 4162.00] one blueberry or one bite of an apple
[4160.24 - 4165.32] will give you more
[4162.00 - 4169.08] antioxidants than pound of chocolate
[4165.32 - 4171.52] cacao can ever offer see sence doesn't
[4169.08 - 4174.04] look at antioxidants and fruit anymore
[4171.52 - 4176.68] they don't because it would spur on a
[4174.04 - 4179.88] massive upsurge of fruit intake and
[4176.68 - 4183.00] fruit production and anti-aging experts
[4179.88 - 4185.44] they don't Echo the power of fruit and
[4183.00 - 4187.84] all the antioxidants they don't they
[4185.44 - 4189.72] just look for these obscure items and be
[4187.84 - 4191.00] like oh that's good for long lasting
[4189.72 - 4193.88] Health that's good so you can live
[4191.00 - 4196.40] forever oh that's good too and this is
[4193.88 - 4198.80] they they don't even they ignore fruit
[4196.40 - 4203.36] there was you know look there was some
[4198.80 - 4205.88] food science done on some fruits at one
[4203.36 - 4209.40] point like 20 years ago and it spawned
[4205.88 - 4212.60] on interest in Fruit being good and it
[4209.40 - 4215.36] was instantly crushed and discredited
[4212.60 - 4217.68] you can guess all the reasons why you
[4215.36 - 4219.84] know you can know you can guess right
[4217.68 - 4222.44] because Corruption of course corruption
[4219.84 - 4225.32] everywhere instead science
[4222.44 - 4228.88] scrambles as it's being paid off by the
[4225.32 - 4231.32] caffeine industry to search for one or
[4228.88 - 4235.00] two types of antioxidants in a coffee
[4231.32 - 4237.32] bean cacao matcha tea or caffeinated tea
[4235.00 - 4239.56] meanwhile caffeine blows out and
[4237.32 - 4241.88] destroys years worth of
[4239.56 - 4244.92] antioxidants so you know what I mean
[4241.88 - 4247.96] it's like okay let's have our caffeine
[4244.92 - 4251.08] beverage get those two antioxidants in a
[4247.96 - 4254.28] small dosage of it and then let's just
[4251.08 - 4256.28] blow out with all that caffeine
[4254.28 - 4258.60] killing off your adrenals and everything
[4256.28 - 4260.84] else because it it Spurs on corrosive
[4258.60 - 4264.24] adrenaline you get an adrenaline Spike
[4260.84 - 4266.28] from caffeine and that adrenaline ages
[4264.24 - 4269.24] you quickly it's
[4266.28 - 4272.60] corrosive it actually injures cells and
[4269.24 - 4274.28] nerves over time when it's every day
[4272.60 - 4275.68] every day and then your hair starts
[4274.28 - 4277.36] falling out when you get older and now
[4275.68 - 4279.36] you're 38 years old and my hair's
[4277.36 - 4281.40] thinning what's going on let me go buy a
[4279.36 - 4283.32] supplement that's Hair Skin and Nails
[4281.40 - 4286.16] let me go to a natural doctor and look
[4283.32 - 4289.08] for some collagen let me go do something
[4286.16 - 4291.72] and your hair is falling out and your
[4289.08 - 4295.16] skin is getting all dry and crazy and
[4291.72 - 4297.00] you're like you're aging at 38 39 when
[4295.16 - 4299.72] you're not supposed to you're aging at
[4297.00 - 4301.24] 30 and here you are thinking you're
[4299.72 - 4303.96] getting your antioxidants because paid
[4301.24 - 4306.28] for science is just totally tricking you
[4303.96 - 4309.84] out and everybody's keeping you away
[4306.28 - 4312.56] from fruit and you need fruit to counter
[4309.84 - 4315.12] your habit that whole thing your
[4312.56 - 4317.24] addiction cuz when you get on that
[4315.12 - 4318.92] Addiction on that caffeine and your
[4317.24 - 4321.00] adrenaline is running fight or flight
[4318.92 - 4323.52] every day because of that caffeine and
[4321.00 - 4325.68] you're aging yourself quickly you better
[4323.52 - 4327.60] be eating a lot of fruit in the mix to
[4325.68 - 4330.48] battle it and counter it with its
[4327.60 - 4333.92] antioxidants to stop you from aging so
[4330.48 - 4337.00] you can so you can keep your habit going
[4333.92 - 4339.56] so all right you guys let's cover some
[4337.00 - 4342.64] of the fruit the fruit hater talking
[4339.56 - 4344.56] points in the health movement and these
[4342.64 - 4346.20] are a couple of my personal favorites
[4344.56 - 4347.56] okay the fruit hater talking points you
[4346.20 - 4350.32] might be ready for this if you're into
[4347.56 - 4353.12] fruit or not or hating fruit they say
[4350.32 - 4356.48] that fruit is hybridized extra sweet
[4353.12 - 4358.48] because it's manipulated by man first of
[4356.48 - 4361.60] all they trick people out with that one
[4358.48 - 4366.36] by confusing them by saying fruit is
[4361.60 - 4369.16] hybridized most people think GMO is what
[4366.36 - 4373.44] it is then they hear hybridize so saying
[4369.16 - 4376.00] oh GMO it's not GMO so hybridize does
[4373.44 - 4380.00] doesn't mean GMO one thing fruit haters
[4376.00 - 4382.96] don't know is we have been hybridizing
[4380.00 - 4385.96] grafting and coveting fruit in different
[4382.96 - 4389.24] ways for thousands of years all around
[4385.96 - 4390.72] the globe this is how the human race
[4389.24 - 4393.40] adapts and
[4390.72 - 4395.60] survives fruit haters and fruit
[4393.40 - 4398.08] demonizes will tell us that we make the
[4395.60 - 4400.44] fruit too sweet now and fruits were not
[4398.08 - 4402.48] sweet a thousand years ago you know
[4400.44 - 4404.20] that's kind of funny because that's
[4402.48 - 4406.44] funny how does they know what fruit
[4404.20 - 4409.08] tasted like thousands of years ago think
[4406.44 - 4411.88] about that one for a minute you guys
[4409.08 - 4414.72] wild blueberries are way more sweeter
[4411.88 - 4418.96] than regular cultivated blueberries did
[4414.72 - 4422.32] you hear that wild blueberries wild are
[4418.96 - 4425.52] way more sweeter than any regular
[4422.32 - 4428.32] cultivated blueberry that instantly
[4425.52 - 4430.20] debunks it I guess we debunked it then
[4428.32 - 4431.76] okay there you go that's a wild food
[4430.20 - 4433.92] that's been around for thousands of
[4431.76 - 4436.36] years wild blueberries
[4433.92 - 4439.12] thousands of years growing here and it's
[4436.36 - 4441.68] sweeter than a cultivated blueberry
[4439.12 - 4444.52] instantly debunked it's the opposite
[4441.68 - 4448.16] fruits aren't sweet enough today fruit
[4444.52 - 4451.64] haters don't realize that fruit was
[4448.16 - 4454.12] sweeter in the past it's not even sweet
[4451.64 - 4455.44] enough today that's that's why you know
[4454.12 - 4458.08] what that's a lot of reasons why people
[4455.44 - 4461.32] hate it right there it's not sweet
[4458.08 - 4463.40] enough they cut open to a mango and it's
[4461.32 - 4465.84] not sweet enough they're like uh what is
[4463.40 - 4467.08] is this they cut they cut open a papaya
[4465.84 - 4470.60] and it's not sweet enough and they're
[4467.08 - 4473.80] like gross what is this this the problem
[4470.60 - 4476.68] is bananas aren't even sweet you peel a
[4473.80 - 4479.36] banana and you eat it you can't even
[4476.68 - 4482.52] taste the sugar sometimes on any level
[4479.36 - 4484.52] in there and so people don't even like
[4482.52 - 4487.20] fruit because it's not even sweet enough
[4484.52 - 4489.56] if it was that sweet and tast it that
[4487.20 - 4492.80] that good and sweet people would be like
[4489.56 - 4495.16] I want that I want that all right the
[4492.80 - 4498.12] bottom one many of the people that I
[4495.16 - 4500.68] know the reason why they hate fruit
[4498.12 - 4502.96] because it doesn't taste sweet that's
[4500.68 - 4505.04] why they actually hate it they'll taste
[4502.96 - 4507.24] some berries they're like tart there's
[4505.04 - 4509.24] really no sugar in them they'll taste
[4507.24 - 4511.24] you know an apple it's just boring it's
[4509.24 - 4512.56] not really that sweet apple pie it's a
[4511.24 - 4513.72] different story I have a friend that
[4512.56 - 4516.60] would be like well I would love this
[4513.72 - 4519.56] apple and an apple pie with sugar table
[4516.60 - 4521.32] sugar added to it okay unless someone
[4519.56 - 4523.36] runs into the sweetest watermelon
[4521.32 - 4526.00] they've ever had like once in a blue
[4523.36 - 4527.84] moon in their life or the only other way
[4526.00 - 4529.60] they actually like fruit is when they
[4527.84 - 4531.28] stop eating all the other sugar in their
[4529.60 - 4533.36] diet all the other sugar that I
[4531.28 - 4535.68] mentioned like get rid of all that cane
[4533.36 - 4537.44] sugar all the nut milks all everything
[4535.68 - 4539.24] that has sugar in it that's sweet all
[4537.44 - 4540.60] the things all the pizza with the pizza
[4539.24 - 4542.00] crust and the cheese and the sauce and
[4540.60 - 4543.56] once they get rid of all that for a
[4542.00 - 4545.52] little while and they eat a piece of
[4543.56 - 4547.40] fruit they're like oh my God this is the
[4545.52 - 4550.20] best thing I've ever tasted in my life
[4547.40 - 4552.96] it's because they basically went without
[4550.20 - 4555.20] all the bad sugar and then finally had a
[4552.96 - 4556.92] PE piece of fruit which isn't even that
[4555.20 - 4559.32] sweet but thought it was the best thing
[4556.92 - 4562.28] ever okay here's a talking point with
[4559.32 - 4565.24] fruit haters heirloom foods that have
[4562.28 - 4567.96] seeds is what counts and that counts
[4565.24 - 4570.52] only well first of all yeah that counts
[4567.96 - 4573.72] true you know and these fruit haters say
[4570.52 - 4578.08] fruit that isn't heirloom and doesn't
[4573.72 - 4581.12] have seeds is bad for us this isn't
[4578.08 - 4585.16] accurate they say it with no evidence at
[4581.12 - 4588.36] all the truth is a Loom heirloom fruits
[4585.16 - 4591.32] heirloom foods are just older varieties
[4588.36 - 4593.84] with seeds or No Seeds there are
[4591.32 - 4596.08] heirloom varieties of fruit with little
[4593.84 - 4599.12] to no seeds and there are heirloom
[4596.08 - 4602.24] varieties with lots of seeds nutrient
[4599.12 - 4605.08] density in phytochemical compounds don't
[4602.24 - 4608.72] discriminate on how many seeds are in a
[4605.08 - 4611.12] fruit so it's like that's another psych
[4608.72 - 4613.40] out they throw at you right there okay
[4611.12 - 4616.32] nutrient density phytochemical IAL
[4613.40 - 4618.88] compounds antioxidants minerals and
[4616.32 - 4622.04] trace minerals have nothing to do with
[4618.88 - 4625.36] if a fruit has a ton of seeds in it or
[4622.04 - 4631.04] very few seeds in it so there you go
[4625.36 - 4634.12] bottom line people harp on non GMO fruit
[4631.04 - 4636.44] and the funny thing is get this point
[4634.12 - 4639.28] right here the people that are harping
[4636.44 - 4641.84] on non GMO fruit meaning fruit that's
[4639.28 - 4644.84] not GMO on any level okay whether it's
[4641.84 - 4647.80] hybridized or air Loom or just
[4644.84 - 4650.40] cultivated or graft it just natural
[4647.80 - 4652.20] things we've done for hundreds of years
[4650.40 - 4654.48] all right to sustain ourselves here on
[4652.20 - 4656.72] planet Earth when people harp on all
[4654.48 - 4658.56] that you know what the funny thing is
[4656.72 - 4663.76] these fruit demonizes are most likely
[4658.56 - 4666.68] consuming GMO soy GMO corn GMO beets the
[4663.76 - 4669.96] anti-aging experts on the circuit with
[4666.68 - 4672.28] podcast they're eating GMO corn GMO
[4669.96 - 4674.52] beets animal products raised on GMO
[4672.28 - 4677.44] grains in restaurants as they're
[4674.52 - 4679.52] traveling periodically in their diet
[4677.44 - 4682.68] unpurified water in restaurants and
[4679.52 - 4686.04] coffee shops GMO canola oil natural
[4682.68 - 4688.56] flavors with MSG nutritional yeast which
[4686.04 - 4690.96] is natural occurring MSG caffeinated
[4688.56 - 4693.12] beverages with GMO soy in it
[4690.96 - 4697.32] occasionally gluten in some way while
[4693.12 - 4699.48] ripping down fruit all day long it's
[4697.32 - 4701.60] sitting there and ripping apart fruit
[4699.48 - 4704.00] and ripping down fruit and they're
[4701.60 - 4706.40] sitting there too on their po podcast on
[4704.00 - 4709.56] their platforms talking about how bad
[4706.40 - 4712.40] fruit is and they're getting GMO stuff
[4709.56 - 4715.00] in their diet left in right is what
[4712.40 - 4718.44] they're doing another difficult part of
[4715.00 - 4721.00] fruit fear and fruit hatred is is the
[4718.44 - 4723.44] very early disinformation that's
[4721.00 - 4726.04] misinformation purposely put out there
[4723.44 - 4728.76] that was strategically placed in the
[4726.04 - 4731.36] health Movement by these paid for moles
[4728.76 - 4733.32] and plants that spark the lies about
[4731.36 - 4735.60] fruit having something to do with poor
[4733.32 - 4737.28] health or causing sickness and not
[4735.60 - 4740.20] helping in any way in someone's healing
[4737.28 - 4742.72] or recovery these moles and plants these
[4740.20 - 4746.68] fruit demonizer I'm talking about that
[4742.72 - 4748.88] did that are still out there now yeah
[4746.68 - 4750.24] yeah they're still out there now you
[4748.88 - 4752.60] better believe
[4750.24 - 4755.20] it they're spouting out and here's the
[4752.60 - 4759.12] funny thing too they're still out there
[4755.20 - 4763.16] now spouting out encrypted biological
[4759.12 - 4768.84] theoretical terminology about anti-aging
[4763.16 - 4771.48] anti-aging DNA DNA telr telr genetic
[4768.84 - 4775.28] codes molecular mimicry genetic
[4771.48 - 4778.92] mutations a leaky gut bofilm
[4775.28 - 4781.80] microflora microbiome and more it makes
[4778.92 - 4785.12] the person who is sick and has already
[4781.80 - 4787.40] been to plenty of doctors believe that
[4785.12 - 4789.60] there is this rainbow of Glorious
[4787.40 - 4791.40] alternative medicine research and
[4789.60 - 4793.28] science that the person with symptoms
[4791.40 - 4795.28] and is sick just doesn't doesn't
[4793.28 - 4798.24] understand or has to tap into it or
[4795.28 - 4800.56] haven't tapped into it yet like like the
[4798.24 - 4802.84] information's out there the message is
[4800.56 - 4805.60] out there these guys are echoing it
[4802.84 - 4807.00] these anti-aging experts with encrypted
[4805.60 - 4809.88] terminology
[4807.00 - 4811.60] telr okay it's interesting when a
[4809.88 - 4813.52] person's laying in bed and they've been
[4811.60 - 4815.92] to their 10th specialist 10th
[4813.52 - 4818.12] neurologist and they're they're 28 years
[4815.92 - 4820.60] old 35 years old they can't even get
[4818.12 - 4822.84] into a car they've got crippling anxiety
[4820.60 - 4825.40] suffering with fatigue and everything
[4822.84 - 4827.32] everything I don't think teles is going
[4825.40 - 4829.16] to help I don't think DNA is going to
[4827.32 - 4831.72] help them and I don't think talk of
[4829.16 - 4834.64] these things really helps and that's the
[4831.72 - 4837.36] irony to it all but these plants and
[4834.64 - 4839.52] moles these these beginners of the fruit
[4837.36 - 4841.60] war on fruit movement from the start
[4839.52 - 4844.56] going back years ago that are still
[4841.60 - 4847.04] around make it seem like there's these
[4844.56 - 4849.64] mysterious options to get everybody
[4847.04 - 4852.16] better and meanwhile everybody's getting
[4849.64 - 4855.08] sicker like ever before you know and it
[4852.16 - 4857.72] makes that sick person feel like they
[4855.08 - 4860.00] just need to find a genius or someone
[4857.72 - 4862.44] who understands anti-aging or someone
[4860.00 - 4864.36] who understands the gut in some way and
[4862.44 - 4866.76] everything else that these moles and
[4864.36 - 4869.52] plants put out there by the industries
[4866.76 - 4872.40] are spouting out in hopes to be healed
[4869.52 - 4874.08] or if a person who is not so sick and
[4872.40 - 4876.24] they haven't suffered or been to five
[4874.08 - 4877.76] doctors they will think these anti-
[4876.24 - 4879.36] fruit moles and plants are on to
[4877.76 - 4880.64] something so if you're not so sick and
[4879.36 - 4882.72] you're not really suffering that much
[4880.64 - 4884.56] you got a little acne got some little
[4882.72 - 4886.56] bumps on your skin you got a little
[4884.56 - 4888.44] tummy thing digestion thing once in a
[4886.56 - 4890.48] while you got a little energy loss and
[4888.44 - 4892.40] you watch one of these Geniuses that are
[4890.48 - 4894.12] on podcasts and other platforms and
[4892.40 - 4895.72] other places that tear down fruit in
[4894.12 - 4899.08] some way and you hear them talk about
[4895.72 - 4901.32] telm and mimicry and and you know
[4899.08 - 4904.20] microflora and you're like oh my God
[4901.32 - 4906.32] these Geniuses and whoa and they got
[4904.20 - 4909.88] answers and they must be working with
[4906.32 - 4912.44] today's science it's a great
[4909.88 - 4914.48] distraction you know while laying around
[4912.44 - 4916.20] with a few symptoms listening to
[4914.48 - 4918.28] podcasts and watching YouTubes and
[4916.20 - 4920.32] hearing about telr and then getting out
[4918.28 - 4922.84] of bed walking to your kitchen wondering
[4920.32 - 4924.56] what to eat and they don't care as they
[4922.84 - 4925.56] spout these theories out and you're like
[4924.56 - 4929.12] well I'm not going to eat a piece of
[4925.56 - 4931.76] fruit today and they kick fruit down as
[4929.12 - 4934.96] if it's crap meanwhile all that
[4931.76 - 4938.16] encrypted genetic anti-aging
[4934.96 - 4941.28] inflammation talk and gut health
[4938.16 - 4943.48] rhetoric doesn't get someone's tenius
[4941.28 - 4946.16] better I'm sorry it doesn't you can
[4943.48 - 4949.12] listen to all those podcasts you want
[4946.16 - 4951.96] and your tenius is going to ring ring
[4949.12 - 4953.40] ring until you learn the true cause
[4951.96 - 4955.52] until you learn the true cause of your
[4953.40 - 4957.96] eye floaters until you learn the true
[4955.52 - 4960.40] cause of your mysterious jaw pain so all
[4957.96 - 4963.72] that Health Ric out there and anti-aging
[4960.40 - 4965.80] and encrypted genetic talk and Tome

[4980.04 - 4983.44] going to get your vertigo better it's
[4981.84 - 4985.44] entertaining I guess because you sit
[4983.44 - 4988.12] there and be like whoa Geniuses that got
[4985.44 - 4990.32] all the answers on the podcast or on the
[4988.12 - 4992.64] YouTube they're so smart they must be
[4990.32 - 4994.92] tied into science and all the key parts
[4992.64 - 4997.20] of healing it's not going to get your
[4994.92 - 4998.88] eczema better you can hear that stuff
[4997.20 - 5001.96] all you
[4998.88 - 5003.96] want but it does lead you to think there
[5001.96 - 5006.48] is this pain fantasy of information that
[5003.96 - 5009.84] these guys know and you just need to
[5006.48 - 5012.96] learn it that anti fruit rhetoric makes
[5009.84 - 5015.92] sense fruit is bad and it will not help
[5012.96 - 5018.32] you heal I'm not saying everyone talking
[5015.92 - 5020.80] this way is an anti-f fruit Moler plant
[5018.32 - 5022.64] or a bad person they just follow all the
[5020.80 - 5026.44] lead and they'll just they'll also speak
[5022.64 - 5028.36] this you know leaky gut tmrs DNA
[5026.44 - 5030.12] anti-aging whatever it is it doesn't
[5028.36 - 5032.04] mean everybody's bad that's not it I'm
[5030.12 - 5034.64] just saying they're The Originals that
[5032.04 - 5037.28] are still out there now setting
[5034.64 - 5040.40] everybody up and they're fed the
[5037.28 - 5043.16] information to set them up and still
[5040.40 - 5046.56] bring down fruit at the same time that's
[5043.16 - 5047.92] what that is and they you know but the
[5046.56 - 5050.36] but there's people out there that just
[5047.92 - 5052.28] take their lead that fruit is bad
[5050.36 - 5053.84] because they don't like fruit anyway cuz
[5052.28 - 5056.24] exactly it's not even
[5053.84 - 5058.80] sweet so it's an easy
[5056.24 - 5061.84] knockdown you know anti- fruit
[5058.80 - 5065.36] propagandists don't want anyone to know
[5061.84 - 5067.96] someone has healed while having fruit in
[5065.36 - 5071.36] their diet check that out I'm just
[5067.96 - 5074.48] saying it like it is they don't want
[5071.36 - 5076.32] anybody knowing someone healed by having
[5074.48 - 5078.84] fruit in their diet they ignore the
[5076.32 - 5081.84] healing Stories the healing recoveries
[5078.84 - 5084.68] that fruit played a role in spirit of
[5081.84 - 5087.20] compassion has always told me you can
[5084.68 - 5089.28] heal with meat in your diet did you hear
[5087.20 - 5090.72] that one Spirit of compassion always
[5089.28 - 5093.76] told me you can still heal with meat in
[5090.72 - 5097.32] your diet depending on your condition
[5093.76 - 5099.84] meat but Spirit of compassion has also
[5097.32 - 5102.64] always told me that you can heal with
[5099.84 - 5105.20] fruit in your diet too and it's critical
[5102.64 - 5108.56] to have it in everyone's diet but the
[5105.20 - 5111.56] fruit haters and the fruit fear creators
[5108.56 - 5113.84] put a blind eye to this very truth the
[5111.56 - 5116.88] truth that so many people have healed
[5113.84 - 5119.96] already using fruit critical recoveries
[5116.88 - 5122.08] life-saving recoveries I'm not biased
[5119.96 - 5122.84] towards meat everybody knows that about
[5122.08 - 5124.40] me
[5122.84 - 5126.84] it's in medical medium books starting
[5124.40 - 5130.48] with medical medium book one but they
[5126.84 - 5132.96] are biased towards fruit interesting the
[5130.48 - 5135.96] this this disinformation they put out
[5132.96 - 5139.36] there purposely about fruit has worked
[5135.96 - 5141.00] its way into the plant-based movement so
[5139.36 - 5143.28] that people trying to heal in that
[5141.00 - 5146.28] movement don't have a shot in hell if
[5143.28 - 5148.08] they're really sick so people who go
[5146.28 - 5150.48] plant-based they don't have a shot in
[5148.08 - 5152.48] hell if they're really sick or keep on
[5150.48 - 5155.04] getting sicker that that's what happens
[5152.48 - 5157.04] and just being gluten-free isn't enough
[5155.04 - 5159.52] and Animal product free isn't enough for
[5157.04 - 5162.56] a lot of people who go plant-based and
[5159.52 - 5165.60] they become afraid of fruit scared to
[5162.56 - 5168.00] death of fruit so they live off of fats
[5165.60 - 5170.56] and then they try to go keto plant-based
[5168.00 - 5173.12] and then their symptoms worsen and then
[5170.56 - 5175.68] another one bites the dust and a plant-
[5173.12 - 5177.64] baser then runs for the hills to eat
[5175.68 - 5180.44] salmon and eggs to start with and
[5177.64 - 5182.24] becomes an animal baser again and starts
[5180.44 - 5184.80] eating animal protein and leaves the
[5182.24 - 5187.20] plant-based movement and if they ate one
[5184.80 - 5190.84] piece of fruit their symptoms will be
[5187.20 - 5194.96] blamed on that seen that 100 times out
[5190.84 - 5196.80] there fruit has become a scapegoat it's
[5194.96 - 5198.76] so you don't have to look at the real
[5196.80 - 5202.20] problems and issues that are causing
[5198.76 - 5205.20] symptoms it protects the industries it's
[5202.20 - 5208.92] above everybody the sabotage the war on
[5205.20 - 5212.84] fruit is above everybody which really is
[5208.92 - 5215.44] the war on people staying healthy what's
[5212.84 - 5218.60] funny is the industries that want to
[5215.44 - 5220.68] keep a sick choose professionals who
[5218.60 - 5223.24] haven't suffered from chronic illness
[5220.68 - 5227.04] yet in their life to spread the fruit
[5223.24 - 5229.60] fear these professionals are easy to
[5227.04 - 5233.12] convince because they don't know what
[5229.60 - 5235.36] it's like to suffer and not get answers
[5233.12 - 5237.76] at least yet in their life even though
[5235.36 - 5240.36] it comes to them too where they get sick
[5237.76 - 5243.84] and they look for answers eventually so
[5240.36 - 5246.20] they don't know what it's like to be so
[5243.84 - 5249.08] sick and to have tried
[5246.20 - 5251.12] everything and they're at that tipping
[5249.08 - 5252.84] scale on the edge with their symptoms
[5251.12 - 5254.88] and illness where they know the
[5252.84 - 5256.96] difference where fruit is really keeping
[5254.88 - 5258.84] them alive they've never experienced
[5256.96 - 5261.56] that where it's keeping them from
[5258.84 - 5265.36] falling more ill having beautiful fruit
[5261.56 - 5268.16] and how important it is to find fruit as
[5265.36 - 5271.32] well they don't know about
[5268.16 - 5274.80] this and they don't know how to use
[5271.32 - 5276.92] fruit as has this healing tool I'm not
[5274.80 - 5280.36] talking about only eating fruit and
[5276.92 - 5282.76] fruit only and nothing else at all
[5280.36 - 5287.16] nothing I'm talking about using it
[5282.76 - 5289.68] specifically in ways as a healing tool I
[5287.16 - 5291.84] have seen so many people with colitis
[5289.68 - 5294.68] and Crohns there are millions of them in
[5291.84 - 5297.16] the world that if they knew how to use
[5294.68 - 5300.00] fruit it could have saved them from
[5297.16 - 5303.12] years of Agony same with people with
[5300.00 - 5305.88] gastroparesis Celiac IBS gastric spasms
[5303.12 - 5309.04] and so many more because yes the ones
[5305.88 - 5310.84] that learn how to use fruit realize fast
[5309.04 - 5313.28] how much it
[5310.84 - 5315.32] matters and these anti- fruit
[5313.28 - 5317.44] professionals that haven't suffered you
[5315.32 - 5319.52] guys that take their queue from
[5317.44 - 5322.08] disinformation spread by moles and
[5319.52 - 5324.72] plants believe they have it all figured
[5322.08 - 5327.28] out and they think they're smarter and
[5324.72 - 5329.48] Superior in health because they haven't
[5327.28 - 5331.48] fallen ill yet but they also take that
[5329.48 - 5333.36] little humble nature to they play that
[5331.48 - 5336.28] games there's a little humbleness going
[5333.36 - 5337.56] on so you're thinking huh you know and
[5336.28 - 5339.68] then you end up thinking maybe they're
[5337.56 - 5341.80] just eating all the right things when
[5339.68 - 5344.00] they are just lucky they can still eat
[5341.80 - 5346.88] pizza drink wine on the
[5344.00 - 5349.04] weekends and here's the thing they teach
[5346.88 - 5351.24] younger people who haven't been sick or
[5349.04 - 5352.96] suffered yet in the health movement who
[5351.24 - 5354.52] also can still eat pretty much what they
[5352.96 - 5356.16] want you know who you know some people
[5354.52 - 5357.88] right you know probably who they are you
[5356.16 - 5360.00] probably see people and they're like
[5357.88 - 5364.16] whoa they can still eat what they want
[5360.00 - 5365.76] they teach them that fruit is bad so
[5364.16 - 5368.16] these younger people naturally spread
[5365.76 - 5370.32] disinformation about fruit other places
[5368.16 - 5372.56] and other things around too and being
[5370.32 - 5374.68] that they know nothing about what causes
[5372.56 - 5377.24] illness even if they're a health
[5374.68 - 5380.20] professional they still have influence
[5377.24 - 5384.32] to take a powerful healing tool like
[5380.20 - 5386.12] fruit and toss it away away from someone
[5384.32 - 5388.08] who could have used it to save their
[5386.12 - 5390.44] life or get a better life or better
[5388.08 - 5393.12] their life I hear it every day check
[5390.44 - 5395.00] this out I hear healing stories of
[5393.12 - 5397.28] people who say they were kept away from
[5395.00 - 5398.68] fruit by all of the propaganda and all
[5397.28 - 5401.04] the different people talking about it
[5398.68 - 5403.40] out there and they were told it was
[5401.04 - 5406.16] going to hurt them maybe even do worse
[5403.40 - 5408.08] than hurt them it would cause their gut
[5406.16 - 5410.60] health problems make them worse cause
[5408.08 - 5412.56] candid or leaky gut but they had nothing
[5410.60 - 5414.28] to lose because they weren't getting
[5412.56 - 5417.04] better any other way because they got
[5414.28 - 5419.44] that sick they got too sick so they took
[5417.04 - 5422.08] the plunge and learned how to use fruit
[5419.44 - 5425.00] as a healing tool properly and it blew
[5422.08 - 5428.28] their minds as they healed fruit
[5425.00 - 5430.68] demonizes don't know how to use fruit
[5428.28 - 5434.00] health professionals who are anti fruit
[5430.68 - 5436.68] don't know how to use fruit health
[5434.00 - 5438.80] professionals that like fruit and are
[5436.68 - 5441.60] Pro Fruit still don't know how to use
[5438.80 - 5444.64] fruit either but it's important to know
[5441.60 - 5447.20] that fruit demonizes especially not only
[5444.64 - 5449.68] don't know how to use fruit but let
[5447.20 - 5452.40] their ego control them so they don't
[5449.68 - 5457.24] even stay open to the possibility that
[5452.40 - 5459.24] fruit heals and they just stay
[5457.24 - 5461.84] misinformed and they are making a
[5459.24 - 5464.32] mistake a mistake that leaves countless
[5461.84 - 5467.44] people chronically ill who are eager to
[5464.32 - 5470.32] learn a way to heal occasionally fruit
[5467.44 - 5474.04] demonizer will say some berries are fine
[5470.32 - 5476.24] green Apple's fine green banana even
[5474.04 - 5479.56] they do that to appease levelheaded
[5476.24 - 5482.72] sensible people that don't fall for the
[5479.56 - 5484.64] anti Fruit game so it's a trick to make
[5482.72 - 5486.60] it look like they're still Pro Fruit but
[5484.64 - 5488.68] they're doing it sensibly you know like
[5486.60 - 5490.60] no just a little this little that but
[5488.68 - 5493.48] who cares if you're sick and you're kept
[5490.60 - 5495.80] from an answer one of the real answers
[5493.48 - 5498.88] one of the real healing tools and one of
[5495.80 - 5501.48] the answers that fruit is good see how
[5498.88 - 5505.48] there's Darkness behind everything when
[5501.48 - 5508.64] you scratch the surface people suffer
[5505.48 - 5510.80] when there's healing tools available you
[5508.64 - 5514.20] know does the word Darkness like bother
[5510.80 - 5516.16] you I look at it this way if innocent
[5514.20 - 5518.92] good people are suffering from chronic
[5516.16 - 5522.52] illness and answers are kept from them
[5518.92 - 5525.60] for devious reasons of any kind and
[5522.52 - 5527.04] someone's laying in bed with no answers
[5525.60 - 5530.48] and one of the things that can be
[5527.04 - 5533.08] helpful is kept from them it's
[5530.48 - 5536.44] darkness and just because professional
[5533.08 - 5537.68] fruit haters don't know how to use fruit
[5536.44 - 5540.44] as a
[5537.68 - 5544.48] tool they would rather throw it under
[5540.44 - 5548.64] the bus along on with the people who are
[5544.48 - 5551.92] sick the spiritual war we are facing
[5548.64 - 5555.52] both here around us and above us can
[5551.92 - 5559.84] only be one if we know the game Darkness
[5555.52 - 5562.88] plays and darkness is uncaring of anyone
[5559.84 - 5564.76] and it holds no compassion and it
[5562.88 - 5568.52] despises the
[5564.76 - 5569.80] light the fruit trees and the brambles
[5568.52 - 5572.32] and the fruit
[5569.80 - 5576.04] Vines have given us love life throughout
[5572.32 - 5580.20] the centuries because they are of the
[5576.04 - 5583.92] light but like anything and everything
[5580.20 - 5586.72] Darkness trains us to take it all for
[5583.92 - 5589.60] granted and why was fruit mentioned over
[5586.72 - 5592.60] 300 times in the Bible because it
[5589.60 - 5595.28] mattered to someone and there's a deep
[5592.60 - 5597.60] connection because fruit is a
[5595.28 - 5601.00] lifegiver not a
[5597.60 - 5602.12] lifetaker fruit signifies renewal of
[5601.00 - 5604.72] life
[5602.12 - 5608.60] as the darkness shuns the fruit and the
[5604.72 - 5609.84] evildoers kill the fruit trees over time
[5608.60 - 5612.48] the Angels
[5609.84 - 5616.36] Cry as the fruit trees
[5612.48 - 5619.12] die ignorance and greed is a great part
[5616.36 - 5621.80] of why we are sick the ones that are
[5619.12 - 5624.76] supposed to protect us here on Earth
[5621.80 - 5627.68] only Mastermind how to harm
[5624.76 - 5630.24] us and hold us back from what's
[5627.68 - 5632.72] rightfully ours as we are led the wrong
[5630.24 - 5636.72] way regardless of who who we
[5632.72 - 5640.12] are fruit hatred gives us Insight that
[5636.72 - 5643.12] the spiritual war is real you can see
[5640.12 - 5645.48] the signs everyone knows there's
[5643.12 - 5648.72] corruption in all the industries and
[5645.48 - 5651.84] they're seeing it more than ever before
[5648.72 - 5653.64] but oddly enough no one thinks there's
[5651.84 - 5655.76] corruption in alternative holistic
[5653.64 - 5658.40] medicine and the Alternative Health
[5655.76 - 5662.16] Information that goes around we think if
[5658.40 - 5665.36] it's holistic it's pure and holy
[5662.16 - 5668.24] no ill intentions at all and for some
[5665.36 - 5671.08] reason the conventional medicine World
[5668.24 - 5673.16] released a magical fairy that has
[5671.08 - 5676.64] allowed the Alternative Health movement
[5673.16 - 5677.52] to be creative and do as it pleases but
[5676.64 - 5680.04] that's
[5677.52 - 5683.44] impossible there are facets of it we
[5680.04 - 5686.08] don't realize ruled by the hierarchy
[5683.44 - 5688.76] over time as they work on breaking our
[5686.08 - 5691.52] thoughts and breaking our minds so what
