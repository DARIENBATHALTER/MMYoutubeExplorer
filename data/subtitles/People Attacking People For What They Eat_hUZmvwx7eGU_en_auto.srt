you know today's food Wars and what you

29
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:13,119
see in front of me is a whole bunch of

30
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:16,240
food whole bunch of food that a lot of

31
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:18,520
people do eat a lot of people don't eat

32
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:22,680
right what does it matter we shouldn't

33
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:27,280
hate them we shouldn't hate

34
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:30,960
people but people do people attack

35
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:33,439
people people attack people and then

36
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,640
people attack people and then people

37
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:38,439
attack people you haven't seen it I'm

38
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:40,360
not talking about trolls on social media

39
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:44,159
I'm not talking about bots on social

40
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:46,920
media I'm talking about just people in

41
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,439
general they attack people and other

42
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,439
people attack people and what comes down

43
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:54,079
to it is judgment on food it's all about

44
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:56,560
judging people about what they're eating

45
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:58,960
and what they're doing but really what

46
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,719
it's all cracked up to be or what it all

47
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,920
amounts to is is two sides of the aisle

48
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:06,280
that's what it amounts to so food Wars

49
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:10,440
means there's a war between the

50
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:15,239
plant-based vegan movement against the

51
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:18,160
animal eating movement the animal

52
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:20,840
eaters they judge and hate the

53
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:25,000
plant-based eaters the plant-based

54
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:27,840
eaters judge and hate the animal eaters

55
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,760
that's the food Wars and then the whole

56
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:33,720
bunch of crap in between Queen and

57
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,400
everybody's also dabbling and flipping

58
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,120
over and everything else here flipping

59
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,239
over there flip flopping there flip

60
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,440
flopping there so everybody's doing all

61
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:43,080
of that

62
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:44,599
too and then when it comes down to

63
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,840
people being sick that takes us to

64
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:47,200
another level which we're going to talk

65
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,519
about as well people with chronic

66
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,400
illness people who are suffering and

67
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:52,519
struggling and where that leads them

68
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:56,440
when it comes down to eating and what

69
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:57,720
kind of eating where and what and how

70
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:00,840
you don't want to miss this episode

71
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:02,440
let's cut right into it now okay now I

72
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,000
don't know what side of the ID aisle

73
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:06,480
you're on you might be on the

74
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,879
plant-based aisle you might be on the

75
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,280
animal protein aisle maybe you're

76
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,640
somewhere in

77
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:14,599
between but years and years and years

78
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,319
ago there used to be just a small amount

79
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:21,360
of plant-based people it's so small like

80
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:23,599
a grain of rice to a silo of rice and

81
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,720
The Silo of rice is the animal eaters

82
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:29,319
right or a grain of sand on the beach

83
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,280
would be the plant-based movement vegan

84
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:32,400
movement

85
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:35,080
and then the rest of the beach filled

86
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:38,360
with sand tons and tons and tons of sand

87
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:41,239
would be the animal eating movement an

88
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:44,040
animal eaters right so that's what it

89
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:46,480
used to be and then over time the vegan

90
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:48,519
movement got a little bigger and a

91
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,040
little bigger and there was a vegetarian

92
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:51,840
movement in the middle but remember the

93
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,720
vegetarians just ate basically

94
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:57,239
everything except for red meat so

95
00:03:53,720 --> 00:04:00,079
vegetarians ate everything except for

96
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:03,239
red meat that's what the old days was

97
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:06,319
like by the way so they ate cheese

98
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:09,439
vegetarians ate cheese they drank milk

99
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:11,959
they ate every o yogurt they did

100
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:13,079
everything ate fish and then the only

101
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:14,720
thing they didn't do is like I'm

102
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:16,680
vegetarian you know what does that mean

103
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,359
oh I can still eat everything except

104
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,120
meat right the vegetarians you guys

105
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:22,520
remember that whole thing there's a few

106
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:25,120
of those old dogs out there there are

107
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:26,840
there's a few of those old dogs left

108
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,880
right where they're eating everything

109
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:32,479
eggs dairy cheese milk butter they're

110
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:35,080
eating everything all of it and they're

111
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:37,280
like but I don't eat red meat you know

112
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:39,280
the vegetarian thing am I just like

113
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,800
entertaining myself on that I mean think

114
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,960
about that that's really funny do you

115
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,240
guys remember and there might be a

116
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:48,280
couple of you guys who are still doing

117
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:51,400
that but overall okay the vegan movement

118
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:55,039
grew and it grew and it grew a little

119
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:58,560
bit more a little bit more okay and then

120
00:04:55,039 --> 00:05:00,479
as it grew all

121
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,600
right

122
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:05,440
a bunch of vegans and plant-based people

123
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:08,840
that were in the movement decided to run

124
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:10,440
back to animal base and then the animal

125
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,240
based movement is interesting because

126
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,919
it's changing and changing where people

127
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,960
are trying keto then they're trying low

128
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,759
carb then they're trying all these

129
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,840
different things and then there flipping

130
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:22,360
over to vegan for a little while but

131
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:25,960
it's become like a dabbling situation

132
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:28,479
where it's a blend a h Posh of everybody

133
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:31,560
pretty much eating anything at any time

134
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:33,000
now there are some staunch vegans out

135
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,039
there still left and there are some

136
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,400
staunch plant- paced people still left

137
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:40,560
out there sure but for the most part

138
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,199
most vegans and most vegans and

139
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,319
plant-based people they just went boom

140
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,960
into eggs they went back into eggs and

141
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:48,160
back into cheese and they go into that

142
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,039
for a while and then they say I got to

143
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,280
be plant-based again for like a week or

144
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:53,720
two I have to someday then a year later

145
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:56,400
they're plant-based for a little while

146
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,960
or they're vegan for a little while and

147
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,560
then boom they're back to eating animal

148
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,759
products do you know anybody like this

149
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,039
back to eating animal products then

150
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:03,039
they're back to being plant-based

151
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:04,960
because they're like you know I need to

152
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:06,199
go plant-based I need to clean things up

153
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,520
I need to and then they're back to

154
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:11,319
eating my animal products right and then

155
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:13,039
there's a lot of Animal product people

156
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:14,400
they're like I'm going to go vegan for a

157
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,680
while I'm going to try it out they try

158
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,919
it for a year something happens where

159
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,560
they were doing good for a little while

160
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:22,039
then something flips a switch Clicks in

161
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,560
maybe they get a symptom they don't feel

162
00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:26,280
good maybe somebody told them they need

163
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:28,240
protein you need protein you need more

164
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:30,360
protein they freak out they freak out

165
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:33,000
boom they're back to animal

166
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:34,720
products and then there's pressure peer

167
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,400
pressure from friends and peer pressure

168
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,800
from family peer pressure from the

169
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:41,720
internet telling you you should be going

170
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,639
one way or another and then someone

171
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:45,759
chimes in it's like this and this and

172
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:48,120
this and everybody gets

173
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:51,319
confused it's the wild west out there

174
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:53,479
still till this day and really

175
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:55,199
everybody's flip-flopping and not

176
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:57,000
certain where they want to go and what

177
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:00,120
they want to do because they might be

178
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,560
vegan or vegetarian or S vegan

179
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:06,160
and plant-based for a couple of

180
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:08,440
years and then they're back to dabbling

181
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:11,199
into animal stuff they're over there and

182
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:13,599
the animal stuff all over again right

183
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:16,840
and that's what they do and the same

184
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:19,039
thing goes for animal as well but the

185
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:22,080
vegans and the plant-based people have

186
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:26,039
it harder than the animal people because

187
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:29,000
the animal people usually stay animal

188
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:31,080
for the most part don't really flip that

189
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,639
much into vegan vegetarian or

190
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:36,120
plant-based

191
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:39,240
long but the plant-based people take the

192
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:42,280
most heat they take the most heat still

193
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:45,560
till this day and they're desperate for

194
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:47,960
science to somehow some way back them up

195
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:51,440
and support them so they can shove that

196
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:53,639
science right up the animal eater asses

197
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:56,840
and that's what they try and want to do

198
00:07:53,639 --> 00:08:00,039
desperately out there is the plant-based

199
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:03,560
movement are desperate for science and

200
00:08:00,039 --> 00:08:05,759
have been forever it's like a desert and

201
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,599
a drop of water falls into the desert

202
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:10,360
and that drop of water is there's

203
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:12,440
protein in Spinach there's protein in

204
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:15,280
Greens I'm going to go to all those

205
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:17,199
animal protein people and scream it out

206
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,759
screaming out to them there's protein in

207
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:22,680
this there's protein in this there's

208
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:24,479
protein in this and the plant-based

209
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:26,319
people and the vegan people kind of

210
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:28,759
picked it up from the old vegetarian

211
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:31,000
people that stopped eating red meat that

212
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:33,519
Fe felt like they were getting their

213
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,599
protein from their soy or their

214
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:39,120
tofu and their tofu and their soy beans

215
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:41,080
were giving them protein so they always

216
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,399
felt like I'm getting my textured

217
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:46,720
protein I'm getting that protein in some

218
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:49,200
way Gina says over there on Facebook

219
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,519
this is so true a friend of 20 years

220
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,720
posted a nasty video about plant-based

221
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:58,720
eating that was directed towards me I

222
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,640
was like what the F this is important to

223
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,000
understand when you're you're struggling

224
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,600
with chronic illness so I want you to

225
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,800
know this isn't just this isn't just a

226
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,160
rant on you know what you eat what you

227
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,519
don't eat what's going on on the

228
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,680
internet I I'm not trying to do that

229
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:15,000
today what I'm trying to tell you is

230
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:16,480
when you're chronically sick that's when

231
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,120
everything shifts and we're going to get

232
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,680
into that this is why this is so

233
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:23,040
important right here

234
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:24,839
okay so the plant-based people in the

235
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:28,120
vegan people I find this really

236
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:30,360
interesting you guys they're

237
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:33,000
desperate

238
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,160
desperate for Science and they have been

239
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,200
for

240
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:39,480
years because they somehow need to tell

241
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:42,000
all their doctors and all their family

242
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:44,720
doctors that I can be plant-based and I

243
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,560
can be vegan and here's some science

244
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:50,800
right here doctor

245
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:55,240

it's the end of the day I'm doing my

276
00:11:17,079 --> 00:11:21,440
best okay let's go into it a little bit

277
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:23,560
food Wars we hear moderation often as

278
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,880
advice about food itself we don't see a

279
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:27,560
lot of moderation in how people debate

280
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:29,480
about food it's very common to see

281
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:31,920
people go to extremes and Def in their

282
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:33,519
chosen food belief system and one thing

283
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:36,200
I'll tell you right now this is

284
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:39,160
incredible the plant-based and the vegan

285
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:41,480
movement on the animal based movement

286
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:45,360
think they're so far apart they think

287
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:50,279
they're so different from each other

288
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:53,560
they believe they are opposite people

289
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:55,320
opposite Everything But the irony is

290
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:57,760
they're closer to each other than

291
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:59,600
anybody knows and the irony is they're

292
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:02,120
more alike

293
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:05,200
than anybody can ever

294
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:06,959
imagine and they're very similar in so

295
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,800
many ways we're going to cover that that

296
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:11,240
anyone ever imagines imagined either if

297
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:13,199

definitely so I want you to know that

311
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,760
there is a war out there and the war

312
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:48,480
does exist and you can end up on one

313
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:50,240
side of the other or just eating alive

314
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,880
in the middle of

315
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:56,120
it if you're somebody who's chronically

316
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:58,399
sick that's when we're susceptible to

317
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:00,519
the BS that's out there within this war

318
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,959
that's going going on the war that

319
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:05,320
ensues right now with the plant-based

320
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:06,880
people against the animal-based people

321
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:09,480
the animal based people against the

322
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:11,519
plant-based people they don't care who

323
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:14,399
gets hurt in the middle and they don't

324
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:16,920
care who gets hurt in any way possible

325
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:20,160
this is important to know they're just

326
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:23,240
so gung-ho and stuck on their darn food

327
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:25,760
belief system it doesn't matter if you

328
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:28,920
get confused or you get persuaded into a

329
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:32,199
different direction or you get hurt that

330
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:37,399
doesn't matter because no one

331
00:13:32,199 --> 00:13:40,079
cares let me repeat no one freaking

332
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:42,639
cares that's how it

333
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:45,120
works because right now there's this

334
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:47,279
like industry war going on right now

335
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,680
okay and it's all about the money money

336
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:51,759
money money it's all about the ching

337
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:55,320
ching ching is what's happening right

338
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:59,000
now okay so you got the plantas vegan

339
00:13:55,320 --> 00:14:01,399
people and they're just rising up trying

340
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,680
to sell [ __ ] 24/7 in programs and

341
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:04,519
courses and everything else rightfully

342
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:06,639
so everybody's doing that just sell sell

343
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:08,639
sell sell sell they got the food belief

344
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,480
system they think they figured it all

345
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,360
out they think they got it down out

346
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:15,000
there and they're out there and they're

347
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:16,360
screaming their their their their Roar

348
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,639
screaming the Roar and you got the

349
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:21,040
animal based people and they're like

350
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:22,720
boom trainers and fitness trainers and

351
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,199
boom protein and everything else and

352
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,839
they're rising up and they're selling

353
00:14:24,199 --> 00:14:27,320
everything under the sun and they're

354
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:29,560
doing this and this but what you'll find

355
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:32,279
out that many of the people that are

356
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:35,079
making the most noise are the least sick

357
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:38,639
they are not in a place where they ever

358
00:14:35,079 --> 00:14:40,680
got sick enough yet they just partially

359
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:43,240
got sick for a little while cleaned up

360
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:45,160

though they experienced limits in their

368
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:05,320
health to some degree with conventional

369
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:07,759
medicine they haven't experienced being

370
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:11,759
really sick where alternative medicine

371
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:14,399
is not helping them where holistic

372
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:17,160
medicine functional medicine alternative

373
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:19,000
medicine hasn't helped them and that's

374
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:21,040
the problem what people don't realize

375
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,639
okay the people making the most noise

376
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:28,160
out there haven't been sick enough yet

377
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:31,360
chronically ill enough to understand

378
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:34,079
that even even alternative medicine has

379
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:36,480
limitations holistic medicine

380
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:39,920
alternative medicine

381
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:42,319
intergrative medicine has

382
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:44,399
limitations and so what happens that the

383
00:15:42,319 --> 00:15:47,720
people screaming out there on both sides

384
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:51,759
of this aisle of plant-based and vegan

385
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:53,680
then animal protein right both sides

386
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:55,360
right of the aisle they're taking all

387
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:58,199
kinds of signs that they're desperate to

388
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,839
fling at the other side and post and put

389
00:15:58,199 --> 00:16:01,880
out there there and scream in people's

390
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:04,000
ears they're desperate to throw their

391
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:06,079
Sciences back at each other over and

392
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,440
over again they're desperate to say you

393
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:10,519
shouldn't be eating animal protein and

394
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:12,800
you should be eating animal protein and

395
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:15,440
it's back and forth and they're into

396
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:17,920
that whole thing we'll go into it

397
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:20,000
deeper and what you'll find is these

398
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:23,839
people screaming and part of the

399
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,440
industry now are hobbyists that never

400
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:28,079
got sick yet and when they do get sick

401
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:30,240
everything changes but they never got

402
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:31,480
reled sick yet this is an important

403
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,519
piece of all of

404
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:36,720
it for example the not so sick that's

405
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:38,720
what they are may know that the ant

406
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,759
asset given to them at the conventional

407
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:44,560
doctor's office didn't work they know

408
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:46,880
that and they know that they can maybe

409
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,920
take some apple cider vinegar shots and

410
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:51,880
see if that could make their problem go

411
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:54,040
away in alternative medicine they know

412
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:56,600
that if they get rid of some some

413
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:58,519
processed food some fried greasy Foods

414
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,839
or whatever they know that if they get

415
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:02,880
get rid of some of the junk Foods they

416
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:04,520
get rid of some of the pizza that they

417
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,799
can start feeling good maybe they can do

418
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:09,400
a little bit of intermittent fasting and

419
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:11,240
they can start picking the pace up and

420
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:13,640
they're feeling better and they think

421
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:15,559
they found the Holy Grail they think

422
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:18,079
they found

423
00:17:15,559 --> 00:17:20,839
Atlantis so people in the plant-based

424
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:22,880
movement and vegan movement know that an

425
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:24,520
anti-acid maybe didn't help them at the

426
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,000
conventional doctor's office but yet

427
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:28,919
they found a little bit of intermittent

428
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,760
fasting get rid of pizzas every day and

429
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:32,520
clean things up a little bit get

430
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:36,640
exercising a little bit more and now

431
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:39,360
they are a guru now they're a guru same

432
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:41,120
thing in the the animal-based People Too

433
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,120
cut your carbs down a little get rid of

434
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:45,679
the fried greasy

435
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:47,400
Foods maybe they'll do some carnivore

436
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:49,120
stuff I'll do some carnivore stuff where

437
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,720
I pretty much get rid of everything that

438
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:53,840
is bad for me and then I'll just focus

439
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:55,840
on some mono eating some chicken for

440
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:58,720
like a week and then I'm starting to

441
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:01,039
feel a little bit better and then boom I

442
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:03,480
found the Holy Grail I found Atlantis

443
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:05,880
deep underneath the ocean the bottom of

444
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:08,039
the ocean I found Atlantis but what you

445
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:10,039
have to understand is they were never

446
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:13,600
really that sick to begin with so now

447
00:18:10,039 --> 00:18:15,440
they're gurus though I'm Guru I'm a guru

448
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,080
now I figured it all out I did a little

449
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,880
intermittent fasting for a month I

450
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:21,720
picked it up in the gym yeah now I'm

451
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:23,520
doing it I'm I'm talking to my

452
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:25,559
alternative medicine people I'm online

453
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,000
figuring some stuff out maybe I can make

454
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:28,919
a business out of this so you got

455
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,320
millions of these people now in the

456
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:33,559
world doing this very thing it's two

457
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:35,120
sides of the aisle you got the

458
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:36,960
plant-based people and the vegan people

459
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:39,600
and then you got the animal based people

460
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:41,240
and the carnivore people they're all

461
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,919

think they're actually the experts and

464
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:50,120
gurus now because they fixed their

465
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:52,440
little problem that they had easily by

466
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:56,760
just cutting out the processed

467
00:18:52,440 --> 00:19:00,080

they're doing their selfies and they're

530
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,440
building up their social and now they're

531
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,080
trying to sell crap and they got their

532
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:38,039
brand going and they're building their

533
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:40,720
brand up you're just in the way if

534
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:42,679
you're chronically sick they're for

535
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,919
those people that just came out of

536
00:21:42,679 --> 00:21:47,279
college been eating pizza and drinking

537
00:21:44,919 --> 00:21:49,760
beer and staying up all night and they

538
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:52,679
get their first UTI and they're like oo

539
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:54,440
I got a second UTI now and a third utti

540
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:57,480
I better start looking into alternative

541
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:59,039
medicine now they look into alternative

542
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:01,640
medicine they clean up this this they

543
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:03,960
find some dude or some chick on the

544
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:05,400
internet on social it seems like they

545
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:07,400
got it all together they're doing the

546
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:09,640
training they sell the programs they got

547
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:11,640
everything and little do they know that

548
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:13,640
they're really not that sick either so

549
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:16,440

Panacea but what people don't realize is

554
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:28,120
the chronically sick who man they got

stuff it's not working they're trying

575
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,960
this person's program this person

576
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:13,120
they've already gotten rid of the

577
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:15,200
processed greasy fried food but they're

578
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:17,200
sick and they're really struggling with

579
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,600
chronic illness and they're in the way

580
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:22,039
of the food

581
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:24,279
Wars they're in the way because it's a

582
00:23:22,039 --> 00:23:26,360
different situation nobody's identifying

583
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:29,400
it or acknowledging it or understanding

584
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:33,039
it and the chronically sick

585
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:37,720
person is dealing with so much more and

586
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:38,679
you got a whole bunch of ego ego Maniacs

587
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:42,240
in the

588
00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:44,360
industry that are in the food War

589
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:47,080
screaming my science is better than

590
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:49,520
yours my science is better than yours

591
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:52,279
mine is and the wars between the

592
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:55,240
plant-based movement trying to prove

593
00:23:52,279 --> 00:23:57,120
themselves all the time to the animal

594
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:58,960
based movement and the animal based

595
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,600
movement's trying to prove themselves

596
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:03,320
all the time to the plant-based movement

597
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:05,200
and that war is ensuing with a bunch of

598
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:07,400
people that never really got that sick

599
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,640
yet that thinks think they know

600
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,880
everything and they're the ultimate

601
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,279
gurus and then everybody who's

602
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:14,600
chronically sick is getting confused

603
00:24:12,279 --> 00:24:18,200
confused confused

604
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:20,279
confused and don't realize that the dude

605
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:22,840
that's like oh I was sick before and

606
00:24:20,279 --> 00:24:24,760
let's just do my program and look I got

607
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:26,880
it going on and I'm doing the

608
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:29,640
weightlifting the jam and I got the

609
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:32,480
selfies in my videos and by my programs

610
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:35,080
you can get as strong as I am and they

611
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,760
don't get it they don't get it that

612
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:38,440
person's got braak that person that's

613
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:41,120
chronically sick has got brain

614
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:45,440
inflammation that no one's picking

615
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:47,640
off they got cranial nerve inflammation

616
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:50,200
they got the ringing in the ears their

617
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:52,200
tongue is buzzing and vibrating their

618
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:54,080
eyes are going like this they get the

619
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:56,200
vertigo the dizziness or the eggs and

620
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:59,520
pains or the fatigue or the brain fog

621
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:03,440
and I could list a 100 other symptoms

622
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:05,799
but they got the nerve the neurological

623
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,799
problems and they got the metals that

624
00:25:05,799 --> 00:25:09,240
are deep in the organs and they're

625
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:12,240
suffering and

626
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:14,919
struggling and they're just in the way

627
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,919
of the food

628
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:22,000
Wars a Noto sick person may believe it's

629
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:25,600
saage sacrilege

630
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:28,840
if you're complaining still after trying

631
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:31,440
to do alternative medicine

632
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:33,520
and that alternative medicine doesn't

633
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,480
have its limits that's what they say

634
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,960
that's what the people who are not so

635
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:38,640
sick it's like alternative medicine

636
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:41,240
doesn't have its limits I went to a

637
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:43,120
great alternative doctor I'm fine I got

638
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:45,559
off of all the junk food I did my

639
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:47,720
research I'm a researcher I'm a

640
00:25:45,559 --> 00:25:49,399
researcher how many times you hear that

641
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:52,080
now you see that in people's profiles

642
00:25:49,399 --> 00:25:52,080
it's like

643
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:58,240
researcher the not so sick person is

644
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,840
also unaware

645
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,399
that as much as a practitioner has

646
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,640
expertise in alternative medicine it

647
00:26:01,399 --> 00:26:04,880
doesn't mean that they have all the

648
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:07,919
tools and knowledge that means

649
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:09,720
that just because you're an alternative

650
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:12,320
practitioner it doesn't mean you have

651
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:13,440
all the tools in the knowledge if you're

652
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,240
really

653
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:18,279
sick and you're not well and you've been

654
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,240
there you know that just because you're

655
00:26:18,279 --> 00:26:21,919
an alternative practitioner it doesn't

656
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:25,279
mean you have all the

657
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:25,279
answers it just

658
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:31,600
doesn't

659
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:34,480
some not so sick individuals can get

660
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:36,559
very staunch about their remedies even

661
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:39,399
vindictive so what here's what it means

662
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:43,840
so in the food Wars some animal-based

663
00:26:39,399 --> 00:26:47,440
people can be staunch on their

664
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:50,360
stuff on their remedies just staunch and

665
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:52,080
then the plant-based vegan movement some

666
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:54,320
of those not so sick people there in the

667
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:57,320
food Wars man they could be staunch

668
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:58,880
about their remedies even vindictive

669
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:00,559
they you can be quick to ridicule

670
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:03,320
anything that doesn't seem part of the

671
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:06,320
norm of alternative

672
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:09,640
medicine anything that's not part of the

673
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:11,720
norm Right medical medium is not part of

674
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:14,240
the

675
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:15,919
norm people who come to Medical medium

676
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,640
information have tried everything

677
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:19,919
they're not just going to go and come to

678
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:22,760
Medical medium

679
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:24,000
information just for any old reason oh

680
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:26,240
I'll just come to Medical medium

681
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,919
information I won't try the millions of

682
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:30,720
other alternative crap that's out there

683
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:32,360
they come to medical medum information

684
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,799
because they've tried it all they've

685
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:36,799
done it all they've been through hell

686
00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:39,679
and back that's why they come

687
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:43,320
here this leads to Alternative Medicine

688
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:45,840
sometimes acting as a cult all doing the

689
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:47,120
same thing all saying the same thing so

690
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:49,519
what you'll notice in alternative

691
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:52,159
medicine and the plant-based movement

692
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:55,799
and the vegan movement is they all parir

693
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:58,880
it the same thing as if it's one big

694
00:27:55,799 --> 00:28:01,960
ugly cult

695
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:04,919
same thing with the animal uh protein

696
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:09,440
animal-based people all

697
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:12,279
parting the same thing protein protein

698
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,600
amino acids amino acids it's like a

699
00:28:12,279 --> 00:28:16,000
goddamn

700
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:18,760
cult that's what it

701
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,600
is because it's really just nothing but

702
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:24,360
like no protein protein that's what you

703
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:27,720
have to do families break up because of

704
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:30,399
the whole protein talk families family

705
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:33,640
members break up because of the whole

706
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:35,279
protein talk there's like Calamity that

707
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:37,320
happens out there that's

708
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:41,600
unbelievable about where you get your

709
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:44,399
protein it's one of those like epic epic

710
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,840
topics that just doesn't stop it just

711
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:48,600
doesn't

712
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:50,600
stop and so many people are up against

713
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:52,240
it and so they're up against peer

714
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:54,880
pressure which is

715
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:58,240
cultish insanely

716
00:28:54,880 --> 00:29:01,519
cultish because what happens here is

717
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:04,880
that the people in the food Wars the

718
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:07,320
staunch animal protein and staunch

719
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:10,559
plantbase they stand with such

720
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:12,960
conviction that the other side is wrong

721
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:15,880
they'll do everything they can to prove

722
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:18,960
that point in somehow some

723
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:21,799
way and so they'll just go and attack so

724
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,799
the attacking

725
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:27,440
happens this leads Salter medicine

726
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:29,360
sometimes acting as a cult all doing the

727
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:32,000
same thing all saying the same thing all

728
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:34,120
belief systems tied together even if

729
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,240
there are subgroups where one Camp

730
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:38,600
believes in plant-based diet and another

731
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:40,240
Camp believes in animal proteins they're

732
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:41,640
still tied together with the same

733
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:44,480
cultish

734
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:48,039
Concepts this mentality can lead some of

735
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:50,360
the not so sick to quickly interrogate

736
00:29:48,039 --> 00:29:53,200
and ridicule and even bully someone

737
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:56,360
who's sick and seasoned someone who's

738
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:57,679
been doing something else so what

739
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:00,159
happens is that there's a lot of

740
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:03,240
bullying going on out there and

741
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:06,399
social for whatever your belief system

742
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:07,279
is the bullying is insane like the

743
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:08,880
medical

744
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:11,320
medium

745
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:14,039
Community was about protecting people

746
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:17,760
from the bullying because it was so

747
00:30:14,039 --> 00:30:19,640
harsh so harsh out there I mean people

748
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:21,080
scream at you if you're eating one way

749
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:24,960
they scream at you if you're eating

750
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:28,399
another way and that's what it's like in

751
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:30,640
Social out there medical me Community is

752
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:34,880
a supportive place for the chronically

753
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:38,480
ill people who are really chronically

754
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:40,720
sick this mentality can lead some of the

755
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:42,640
not so sick people who aren't that sick

756
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,880
people who didn't get really sick yet to

757
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:47,039
quickly

758
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:49,080
interrogate and Bully the person who's

759
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:52,120
really

760
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:55,360
sick at the same time some of the not so

761
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:56,880
sick exalt alternative medicine and

762
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,519
you'll see that out there the not so

763
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,159
sick out there they've never been sick

764
00:30:58,519 --> 00:31:02,000
enough but they're building their brands

765
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:03,960
they're building up they'll exalt

766
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,799
alternative

767
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:10,000
medicine they'll say cold plunging is

768
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:13,320
the answer like cold plunging is the

769
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:15,799
answer and they'll just exalt it on a

770
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:18,159
pedestal they'll put it up there as an

771
00:31:15,799 --> 00:31:21,360
idol to pray

772
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:23,559
to and if cold plunging didn't fix you

773
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:26,200
then you're just screwed

774
00:31:23,559 --> 00:31:28,240
up if cold plunging didn't fix you

775
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:30,799
you're just yeah you're just screwed up

776
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,799
that's what you

777
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:38,840
are at the same time some of the not so

778
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:41,080
sick people exalt alternative medicine

779
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:43,480
they tend to believe that if the world

780
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:45,240
of alternative medicine did fail them

781
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:47,440
certainly conventional medicine would

782
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:49,919
redeem itself and be there to catch

783
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,440
their fall they believe this even after

784
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:53,480
having a spell with conventional

785
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,760
medicine that wasn't fixing them that's

786
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:57,159
another thing that happens in the food

787
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:59,799
Wars the not so sick people both PL

788
00:31:57,159 --> 00:32:02,080
plant-based and vegan believe that if

789
00:31:59,799 --> 00:32:05,279
they fail somehow if alternative

790
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:08,720
medicine failed them somehow then

791
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:11,200
conventional medicine will save them

792
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:13,960
they really believe that and then the

793
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:17,559
animal protein based people who are not

794
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:19,799
so sick right they believe that if they

795
00:32:17,559 --> 00:32:22,159
ever failed and alternative medicine

796
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:25,399
failed them they believe conventional

797
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:28,080
medicine will then come in and fix it

798
00:32:25,399 --> 00:32:30,720
and make all their troubles go

799
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:32,519
way both the not so sick and the sick

800
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:35,240
are looking for answers though at the

801
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:37,720
same time The Not So Sick can partake in

802
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:39,559
past present and future Trends they

803
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:41,519
usually won't realize the needles not

804
00:32:39,559 --> 00:32:43,519
being moved and they're not making real

805
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:45,519
progress so if you're not that sick you

806
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:49,840
can still partake in everything cold

807
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:53,279
plunging breathing exercises any

808
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:56,159
meditation um and the list goes on right

809
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:58,120
this water that stuff you know water

810
00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:01,639
fasting

811
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:03,399
juice fasting longterm whatever it is so

812
00:33:01,639 --> 00:33:05,159
they believe that they can partake in

813
00:33:03,399 --> 00:33:06,720
all of that but they don't know what's

814
00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:08,880
moving the needle or not cuz they were

815
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:12,039
never that sick it's like taking

816
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:14,240
somebody who never got ill yet they only

817
00:33:12,039 --> 00:33:16,240
had a couple little things that they got

818
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,960
better just by cleaning up their diet a

819
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:20,039
little bit and you just you could put

820
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:22,039
them through anything really for a while

821
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:23,440
you can have them try anything and they

822
00:33:22,039 --> 00:33:26,399
really don't know what moves the needle

823
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:28,960
they just think it's working because hey

824
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:28,960
they're not

825
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:34,440
sick their good health or their health

826
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:36,159
that's good enough is overriding any

827
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:38,519
effects of anything negative that

828
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:40,960
they're doing all right so I want to cut

829
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:44,559
into a couple of other things too you

830
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:47,480

right both sides of the aisle animal

840
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:13,320
based and

841
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:14,520
plant-based believe that protein is the

842
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:16,320
answer for

843
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:20,040
everything they

844
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:23,359
do they're married to the protein

845
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:24,250
concept the protein Theory the protein

846
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:25,320
belief

847
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:27,520
[Music]

848
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:29,760
system their

849
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:32,159
married for

850
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:34,520
life it's there in their psyche and

851
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:38,440
their Consciousness and you can't remove

852
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:40,839
it they learn it at a young age and they

853
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:43,639
take it from there when they go into the

854
00:34:40,839 --> 00:34:45,800
alternative medicine world it's still

855
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:48,720
there it started in conventional

856
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:51,000
medicine it is in the alternative

857
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:53,440
medicine they think the reason they're

858
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,240
alive is protein so people believe

859
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:57,400
they're alive because of the protein

860
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:58,560
they're eating if they're plant-based

861
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:00,320
they believe they're alive because of

862
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:02,000
the plant-based protein they're eating

863
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,560
if they're animal based they think

864
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,760
they're alive because of the protein

865
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:10,000
they're eating is an animal based person

866
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:12,640
okay this partly comes from most people

867
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:15,440
being raised on animal protein vegans

868
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:17,480
and plant-based people won't adopt this

869
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:20,320
way of eating unless someone convinces

870
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:22,320
them in a confident manner that there's

871
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:24,000
protein in plant in a plant-based diet

872
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:26,560
so that's another thing

873
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,200
too what you'll notice is people moving

874
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:30,280
into plant

875
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:33,200
base the only way they're going to move

876
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:36,000
into plant-base is if they're confident

877
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:41,880
there's enough protein there because all

878
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:45,119
it takes is one boo one boo that's it

879
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:47,160
not enough protein and the person runs

880
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:48,640
screaming it's like you got somebody

881
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:50,720
that's starting off of the plant-based

882
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:52,359
movement a little bit doing plant-base

883
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:55,040
they're trying it they're feeling a

884
00:35:52,359 --> 00:35:56,359
little better they're they're excited

885
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:58,280
about what they're eating they're proud

886
00:35:56,359 --> 00:36:00,319
of what they're eating and then someone

887
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:03,520
all they have to do is just whisper in

888
00:36:00,319 --> 00:36:07,000
their ear it's got no protein and they

889
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:11,920
will scream and go

890
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:16,319
running because that is a weapon it's

891
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:16,319
weaponized and that's happening right

892
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:22,079
now both animal-based and plant-based

893
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:25,079
folks are brainwashed to think it's all

894
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:28,040
about protein because protein sounds

895
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:31,839
scientific got to keep in mind that

896
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:32,720
anybody doing a diet of any kind for

897
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:35,319
their

898
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:37,480
health they they have to feel their

899
00:36:35,319 --> 00:36:40,000
science behind it in some

900
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:42,119
way because science becomes like that

901
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,280
comfortable blanket they got a nice

902
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:46,040
comfy blanket it's a science blanket and

903
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:48,680
everything's going to be fine cuz

904
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:51,920
science has all the checks you know

905
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:53,680
marked off and it's all good and they

906
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:56,000
feel confident because they're in

907
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:59,119
they're basking in that warmth and that

908
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:01,720
comfort of science saving them so if

909
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:04,119
science says protein and proteins in my

910
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:06,520
food I'm good they have to feel that

911
00:37:04,119 --> 00:37:11,760
their diet belief system no matter what

912
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:14,079
kind of name it gets to fancy it up is

913
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:15,640
science-based people believe if they're

914
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:17,480
going to be eating something different

915
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:19,640
or start eating things that are

916
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:21,800
different and start traveling into that

917
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:25,640
place of alternative medicine both

918
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:27,119
animal or or plant they need to think

919
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:29,560
that there's definitely

920
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:31,520
science-based within it all both sides

921
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:34,240
are also brainwashed for

922
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:36,400
confrontation before people who've gone

923
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:38,200
plant-based eventually revert to animal

924
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,319
products first they fight back

925
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:43,839
plant-based folks don't look at animal

926
00:37:40,319 --> 00:37:47,160
based folks and say look we're all

927
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:48,880
sick inside each side seeks out their

928
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:50,520
weapons of choice in the form of studies

929
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,720
and research papers because that's

930
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:55,200
another thing too they

931
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:56,839
weaponize they weaponize science and

932
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:58,960
science studies and what you'll not Noti

933
00:37:56,839 --> 00:38:01,040
in the science study Department which is

934
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:05,319
hilarious is that when someone throws

935
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:07,200
out a science study or science article

936
00:38:05,319 --> 00:38:09,720
what's in the article isn't even what

937
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:11,560
they're talking about what's in the

938
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:13,440
study isn't even what they're talking

939
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:14,440
about people aren't going to take the

940
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,920
time they're not going to take the time

941
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:18,200
to read the study they may not even

942
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:21,400
understand the study if they ever did

943
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:24,160
read it so that's a weaponized situation

944
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:26,240
all on its own so when you see somebody

945
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:28,680
and they're like look this plant-based

946
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:30,400
diet and this here does this here's a

947
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:32,480
scientific study for it no one's going

948
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,079
to read it and if they did read it

949
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,640
they'd be like I'm missing something

950
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:37,560
here because that's not what the person

951
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:40,480
was even talking about but yet it's

952
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:43,319
weaponized and used to that

953
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:45,400
degree both the committed and committed

954
00:38:43,319 --> 00:38:47,599
animal protein people and the committed

955
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:49,680
plant-based and vegan people call

956
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:51,480
themselves researchers now I covered

957
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:53,400
that earlier they spend a lot of time on

958
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:55,839
the internet looking around for

959
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:57,319
information so they're researching but

960
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:59,400
what are they researching searching

961
00:38:57,319 --> 00:39:01,000
that's another thing all on its own star

962
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:03,240
catcher says over there on YouTube as a

963
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:06,760
vegan I don't feel desperate for science

964
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:08,400
we have tons of science behind it well

965
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:10,480
that's the whole thing that tons of

966
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:12,839
science behind it is that warm comfy

967
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:15,119
blanket I was just talking about and

968
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:17,119
that has to be there for you to actually

969
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:18,599
probably want to be vegan because you're

970
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:20,000
saying you have a ton of science behind

971
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:22,440
it now I'm not against vegan I'm not

972
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:25,880
against the animal protein that's not

973
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:28,960
what this is but what you just said

974
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:31,880
proved my my point that there's a ton of

975
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:35,160
science behind plant-based so you're not

976
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:37,560
desperate for science what that means is

977
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:40,599
this exactly what I said that's your

978
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:43,359
comfy warm blanket that there's science

979
00:39:40,599 --> 00:39:46,280
behind it and everything's

980
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:49,400
fine they throw articles at each

981
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:51,040
other that are science-based so the

982
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:52,800
plant-based movement is throwing

983
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:55,400
articles at the animal based the animal

984
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:58,319
based is throwing articles at the

985
00:39:55,400 --> 00:40:01,079
plant-based that's huge it's happening

986
00:39:58,319 --> 00:40:04,000
every day right now they say well this

987
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:06,480
keto study says this when it isn't even

988
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:09,240
a real study it's a survey or an

989
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:10,680
uninformed observation or a theoretical

990
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:12,800
paper put together by health

991
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:15,640
professionals with limited experience on

992
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:18,040
the subject and if they do reference an

993
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:20,160
actual clinical study how reputable was

994
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:22,040
it who funded it was it based on a

995
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:24,480
handful of paid participants from the

996
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:27,720
same age and background monitored over a

997
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:29,160
very short time or was was it something

998
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:31,680
better than

999
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:33,400
that meanwhile they're all still getting

1000
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:37,640
sick so let's go into this a little bit

1001
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:40,400
plant-based and animal based people they

1002
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:43,640
fall they might be not so sick to start

1003
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:44,720
with maybe they're healthy enough but

1004
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:46,640
they

1005
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:51,240
drop they

1006
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:54,839
fall over time it happens every day it's

1007
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:58,359
out there and when they start falling

1008
00:40:54,839 --> 00:41:01,880
they doubt everything they've ever

1009
00:40:58,359 --> 00:41:04,720
done they doubt everything they ever did

1010
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:07,560
what they used what they may may have

1011
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:10,680
should have they thought used whatever

1012
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:14,640
strategy they had whatever belief system

1013
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:18,079
all of it turns into a mud

1014
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:20,400
puddle the minute something happens to

1015
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:22,920
you like you get the exposure or a virus

1016
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:25,520
comes out of dormy and now you're sick

1017
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:27,400
and you're really Doctor shopping

1018
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:29,680
everything

1019
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:31,240
is either on the table or everything is

1020
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:35,079
either off the

1021
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:37,760
table that's when it's like whoa and it

1022
00:41:35,079 --> 00:41:42,319
happens every single day I

1023
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:45,599
know because at Medical medium we get

1024
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:48,839
thousands and thousands of

1025
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:50,880
DMS and in those DMS are I was never

1026
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:53,839
sick before in my life I ate good I was

1027
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:56,319
really healthy I'm a trainer of 10 years

1028
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:57,960
I'm desperate in needing your help

1029
00:41:56,319 --> 00:42:00,160
because I can't function and I have a

1030
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:02,319
brain fog that's making it so I'm taking

1031
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:03,960
benzo as aines and I don't know what to

1032
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:07,520
do

1033
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:10,839
anymore I thought I had it down every

1034
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:12,480
single day you know I had this one

1035
00:42:10,839 --> 00:42:14,680
symptom and it was doing great when I

1036
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:16,440
started intermittent fasting and then I

1037
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:19,760
you everything was great for about 3

1038
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:21,839
months four months I was doing good and

1039
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:23,559
all of a sudden now I can't feel my legs

1040
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:25,559
anymore I've been to five doctors I

1041
00:42:23,559 --> 00:42:28,200
don't know what's wrong with me and if

1042
00:42:25,559 --> 00:42:32,520
they fall and then it all turns to

1043
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:35,240
Mud every single week every single year

1044
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:38,119
we see it thousands upon thousands of

1045
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:39,680
people that had good health seemingly

1046
00:42:38,119 --> 00:42:41,680
everything was good they were

1047
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:46,000
researchers they were connoisseurs of

1048
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:47,839
alternative medicine they they many were

1049
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,640
like I don't like Pharmaceuticals and

1050
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:52,280
many were like I don't like this and

1051
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:53,839
they all had this belief system and they

1052
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:55,599
were on either side of the aisle they

1053
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:59,040
were plant-based and vegan or they were

1054
00:42:55,599 --> 00:43:01,640
animal prot R and they

1055
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:04,559
fell and many of them are like I'm an

1056
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:06,960
Olympic Athlete aw and I can't even get

1057
00:43:04,559 --> 00:43:08,880
out of bed right now and I've been keto

1058
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:11,440
all these years I've tried carnivore I

1059
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:14,400
did good on Carnivore for a while and

1060
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:17,040
I'm Olympic Athlete I'm a gold medalist

1061
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:18,160
I need your help and I'm desperate and I

1062
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:20,680
don't know what to do anymore and I've

1063
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:23,119
been to my like 20th doctor every single

1064
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:26,160
day it's like

1065
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:29,480
this and that's how it works but the

1066
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:31,480
chronically sick who are trying to heal

1067
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:33,040
don't know they're not aware of all this

1068
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:35,440
that's happening they're not aware of

1069
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:39,079
the games in the industry whole bunch of

1070
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:42,280
not so sick people building their brands

1071
00:43:39,079 --> 00:43:44,160
screaming science back at each other

1072
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:46,480
confusing

1073
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:48,760
everybody two sides of the aisle you're

1074
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:50,200
either on one aisle or the other and

1075
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:52,240
anybody who's chronically sick and

1076
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:53,880
between you're just kind of like caught

1077
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:58,079
in the mucket of all even if you don't

1078
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:58,079
realize it it happens

1079
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:02,240
I want to talk about how both sides of

1080
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:04,280
the aisle are brainwashed I want to just

1081
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:06,640
cover that one little spot right

1082
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:08,440
here and the thing the thing you know

1083
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:11,079
what happens is things change when

1084
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:12,960
people find medical medium

1085
00:44:11,079 --> 00:44:15,040
information you know but I'm just

1086
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:18,760
telling you this is what's happening out

1087
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:20,480
there okay both sides are brainwashed

1088
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:22,880
this is really

1089
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:24,760
interesting the bottom line is that both

1090
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:27,240
sides are brainwashed they're

1091
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:30,559
brainwashed that they can trust the

1092
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:30,559
science behind their

1093
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:36,280
diet the brainwashed that they can trust

1094
00:44:34,359 --> 00:44:38,880
the science behind their

1095
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:41,119
diet that one's one of my

1096
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:43,800
favorites they're brainwashed that

1097
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:45,880
protein is

1098
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:48,200

Wars all right so their brain washed to

1114
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:31,000
confront each other their both sides are

1115
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:32,760
Brainwashed the intermittent fasting is

1116
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,200
healthy and you might hear that right

1117
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:37,599
now and say intermittent fasting is

1118
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:40,800
healthy because it is healthy it

1119
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:42,920
is but it's not healthy medical me

1120
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:46,920
information talks about why in the whole

1121
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:48,440
bit why it's critical not to go too long

1122
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:50,640
without

1123
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:52,839
food because of what happens to the

1124
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:56,280
adrenals and what happens to other

1125
00:45:52,839 --> 00:45:58,160
situations with your body so both sides

1126
00:45:56,280 --> 00:46:00,119
believe intermittent fasting is healthy

1127
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:01,200
both sides are brainwashed that caffeine

1128
00:46:00,119 --> 00:46:05,079
is

1129
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:06,800
good yeah that's right plant-based

1130
00:46:05,079 --> 00:46:10,079
doctors all have their caffeine every

1131
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:12,640
single morning the plant-based podcast

1132
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:14,839
doctors have their caffeine plant-based

1133
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:17,640
people think cacao caffeine is really

1134
00:46:14,839 --> 00:46:20,319
good for you but the animal based people

1135
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:22,359
believe Cacao is good for you carnivore

1136
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:24,800
people even believe that now everybody

1137
00:46:22,359 --> 00:46:26,440
believes that cacao's good for

1138
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:30,359
you

1139
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:32,400
both sides are Brainwashed the quality

1140
00:46:30,359 --> 00:46:35,720
salt to

1141
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:38,640
food is good and that Apple CID of

1142
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:41,319
vinegar is good but there's such thing

1143
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:42,800
as too much salt and both sides don't

1144
00:46:41,319 --> 00:46:45,200
believe that

1145
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:46,720
now both sides are brainwashed that you

1146
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:48,760
can fix all your problems through

1147
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:51,520
breathing techniques or through

1148
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:53,839
manifesting so right now and I'm not

1149
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:56,040
saying other or different I'm just

1150
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:59,200
saying that both sides plant B based

1151
00:46:56,040 --> 00:47:00,960
movement and the animal based movement

1152
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:04,200
believe

1153
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:06,839
okay that they can solve their problems

1154
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:09,119
through breathing techniques and through

1155
00:47:06,839 --> 00:47:10,079
manifesting not saying manifesting is

1156
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:12,280
bad or

1157
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:14,839
good I'm just saying that's what they

1158
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:17,440
believe both sides are brainwashed that

1159
00:47:14,839 --> 00:47:19,760
chocolate is plant

1160
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:21,839
medicine and it's good for you so that's

1161
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:24,359
one thing that's really interesting too

1162
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:26,440
because it's just like the whole caca

1163
00:47:24,359 --> 00:47:29,040
thing but they even believe

1164
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:32,119
chocolate which yeah it's cacao but it

1165
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:34,480
moved into chocolate bars that's even

1166
00:47:32,119 --> 00:47:36,800
good it's not just like cacao and you

1167
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:39,280
got like a high quality cacao which

1168
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:40,680
still has caffeine in it still a problem

1169
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:42,680
I know that people eat it fine they

1170
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:46,079
could do what they want but even

1171
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:48,520
chocolate bars like 90% 80% 70%

1172
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:50,119
chocolate with sugar in it the whole bit

1173
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:52,400
you know it's good for you it's plant

1174
00:47:50,119 --> 00:47:53,760
medicine people eat chocolate bars every

1175
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:55,760
single day they think they buy the

1176
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:58,480
organic healthy chocolate bars

1177
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:59,760
sustainable and they're like all good so

1178
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:02,319
that's one right

1179
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:04,680
there both sides of the aisle are

1180
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:08,359
brainwashed that you that they don't

1181
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:10,520
create any waste with their food

1182
00:48:08,359 --> 00:48:12,160
decisions so whatever food decision

1183
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:14,119
you're making and how you do your diet

1184
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:15,960
and what you do you believe that you

1185
00:48:14,119 --> 00:48:18,240
probably don't create that much waste if

1186
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:21,319
you're on one of these sides of the

1187
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:22,480
aisle and both believe that if you ever

1188
00:48:21,319 --> 00:48:24,839
challenged

1189
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:26,599
anybody if you ever talked with them or

1190
00:48:24,839 --> 00:48:29,599
interviewed them you think they'd be

1191
00:48:26,599 --> 00:48:32,040
like oh yeah I create tons of food

1192
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:34,720
waste it's like if you talk to some

1193
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:37,079
animal protein Guru and you tell them

1194
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:38,720
like are you sustainable are you not you

1195
00:48:37,079 --> 00:48:42,240
know are you creating too much food

1196
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:43,760
waste they say no way not creating any

1197
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:45,440
food waste and the same thing with

1198
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:47,839
plant-based people like are you creating

1199
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:50,720
any food waste they'd be like no way

1200
00:48:47,839 --> 00:48:53,960
we're not contributing to food waste

1201
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:57,599
both sides believe that they're both

1202
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:57,599
brainwashed to believe that

1203
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:03,000
Alicia over there on IG Anthony why do

1204
00:49:01,319 --> 00:49:05,000
you think

1205
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:08,119
people bash

1206
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:10,599
mm info after healing with

1207
00:49:08,119 --> 00:49:12,559
it so here's how it works with the

1208
00:49:10,599 --> 00:49:13,760
bashing medical meme information after

1209
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:17,480
healing with

1210
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:20,839
it it's about brands starting your own

1211
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:22,760
brand okay so what they do is they have

1212
00:49:20,839 --> 00:49:25,680
to bash mm

1213
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:27,799
information or people won't go and buy

1214
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:32,079
their new product they're selling which

1215
00:49:27,799 --> 00:49:34,440
is like a course a class or some kind of

1216
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:36,040
program so what I'm noticing is the

1217
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:39,200
people that bash medical medium after

1218
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:42,000
using it to heal they're all doing their

1219
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:45,960
business and businesses I'm just telling

1220
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:48,680
you how it is and how it works okay so

1221
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:50,079
if you don't bash medical medium people

1222
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:54,280
are going to be like why should I buy

1223
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:56,440
your $500 course or your $3,000 course

1224
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:58,000
when I can just get free information

1225
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:59,640
from medical medium's books you can get

1226
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,000
out the library or just listen to all

1227
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:03,680
his stuff and get free you know lectures

1228
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:06,480
every day from them or whatever it is

1229
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:08,960
and free information and his podcast and

1230
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:11,040
so forth and so what happens is they

1231
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:13,160
bash medical medum information because

1232
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:16,799
they want them to come to

1233
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:19,359
them I'm selling a $3,000 course medical

1234
00:50:16,799 --> 00:50:22,040
medium can't do it for you it's it

1235
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:23,160
doesn't work oh yeah know I did heal

1236
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:25,720
from

1237
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:27,240
it and then they changed their tune too

1238
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:30,119
so anybody who's

1239
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:32,200
bashing anybody who's healed using

1240
00:50:30,119 --> 00:50:34,520
medical medum information and then they

1241
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:36,480
start their business on social and their

1242
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:38,720
brand and then they bash medical medium

1243
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:40,520
information stop saying medical medium

1244
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:43,240
information heal them and they delete

1245
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:43,240
all their past

1246
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:50,920
posts so that's what they do too and

1247
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:52,599
they say by my products you know by my

1248
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:54,040
you know ionizer water machines and what

1249
00:50:52,599 --> 00:50:56,000
you'll notice is a lot of the people

1250
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:58,720
that bash medical Med information their

1251
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,960
ionizer water machine sales people the

1252
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:02,119
pyramid

1253
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:03,720
scheme and they know that medical medium

1254
00:51:02,119 --> 00:51:07,400
doesn't support the ionizer water

1255
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:11,640
machines so they purposely bash mm for

1256
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:13,680
that but it's about building your brand

1257
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:16,880
and then stepping on the very thing that

1258
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:18,880
healed you and then not telling anybody

1259
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:22,480
it healed you

1260
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:24,680
anymore and then leading them into your

1261
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:26,079
feed and then trying to sell them

1262
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:28,839
whatever program thing you're doing

1263
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:29,960
that's $3,000 $5,000 or $2,000 whatever

1264
00:51:28,839 --> 00:51:32,839
it

1265
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:34,079
is I got I don't care if anybody's

1266
00:51:32,839 --> 00:51:36,480
trying to make money and doing things

1267
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:38,280
and selling things whatever it is that's

1268
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:39,359
the world we live in that's what

1269
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:42,400
everybody

1270
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:44,839
does but yeah but that is what that's

1271
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:48,400
how they're doing it so that question

1272
00:51:44,839 --> 00:51:50,640
you just asked I'm just answering it to

1273
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:53,200
you know how it's done and there's a lot

1274
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:55,760
more info along with that and I can talk

1275
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:57,559
about that for like quite a while but

1276
00:51:55,760 --> 00:52:00,680
that's what they do it's about building

1277
00:51:57,559 --> 00:52:03,839
your brand hiring like you know taking a

1278
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:06,720
course that teaches you how to take the

1279
00:52:03,839 --> 00:52:09,960
information poach it and not cite it

1280
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:13,040
anymore and then re repackage it for

1281
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:15,000
your own program and then [ __ ] on the

1282
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:17,680
person who created that

1283
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:20,319
information and then sell it to some

1284
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:22,559
other people and then bash medical

1285
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:25,799
medium in what seems to be like a kind

1286
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:28,319
of like way where yeah well

1287
00:52:25,799 --> 00:52:30,520
it doesn't really help that much and it

1288
00:52:28,319 --> 00:52:32,520
didn't really help me that much and you

1289
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:34,599
know try my stuff and a whole bunch of

1290
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:37,160
stuff like that a lot of misinformation

1291
00:52:34,599 --> 00:52:39,839
people have mixed in with medical

1292
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:41,839
medium info a lot of people don't

1293
00:52:39,839 --> 00:52:43,400
actually learn the info and read the

1294
00:52:41,839 --> 00:52:44,559
books themselves so there what's

1295
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:46,119
happening out there too is they're

1296
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:47,440
packaging up medical medium information

1297
00:52:46,119 --> 00:52:49,640
they're mixing it with a whole bunch of

1298
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:51,799
other information and they're try to

1299
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:53,839
sell it or they'll just take mm info and

1300
00:52:51,799 --> 00:52:55,240
pack [ __ ] up and and try to sell it so

1301
00:52:53,839 --> 00:52:57,920
that's what's happening and that's why

1302
00:52:55,240 --> 00:53:02,240
while you're seeing that people bashing

1303
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:04,960
medical medium info it's it's a way also

1304
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:07,640
it's a way to try to like get some

1305
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:10,000
haters on board haters are like they're

1306
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:11,720

it's like you get a few haters on board

1308
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:16,240
the haters are now screaming and then

1309
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:18,559
you get a few extra people in and then

1310
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:22,119
you get lucky it's like and it's like

1311
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:24,440
the scratch off tickets at the you know

1312
00:53:22,119 --> 00:53:27,079

1313
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:32,000
lucky and all of a sudden you just won a

1314
00:53:27,079 --> 00:53:35,200
new person who buys your program for

1315
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:37,040
$1999 and it's like whoa this really

00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:44,000
medium and then they throw a bunch of

1319
00:53:41,839 --> 00:53:46,240
like psychological warfare in the mix

1320
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:49,079
where they're just like yeah medical

1321
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:51,280
medium didn't really work it kind of did

1322
00:53:49,079 --> 00:53:53,440
but it did meanwhile PE they posted

1323
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:56,119
hundreds of posts about how it saved

1324
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:57,880
their life a like they showed how

1325
00:53:56,119 --> 00:53:59,520

they delete all of

1329
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:10,079
that I'm it's just crazy also there are

1330
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:12,440
people in the community pretending to be

1331
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:13,960
a part of the community when they're not

1332
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:16,400
and they're faking it so they can

1333
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:18,680
mislead people and push them off to some

1334
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:20,040
other place and ruin their health that

1335
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:21,440
happens every day in the medical meme

1336
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:22,960
Community it's a whole bunch of people

1337
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:24,440
with fake accounts that are actually

1338
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:26,640
trying to basically dismantle the

1339
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:28,960
medical meme community and they have

1340
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:31,480
like 20 fake

1341
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:33,319
accounts and we know this and they're

1342
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:36,760
out there and they're just in the

1343
00:54:33,319 --> 00:54:41,839
community trying to actually persuade

1344
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:44,119
people to not do their hmds to not do

1345
00:54:41,839 --> 00:54:46,720
the stuff they need to do for

1346
00:54:44,119 --> 00:54:49,160
themselves yeah it's

1347
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:51,200
crazy both sides of the aisle

1348
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:54,000
unknowingly get too much blood drawn

1349
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:56,280
when they get a blood test by the way

1350
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:59,240
Uma over there on YouTube yeah we

1351
00:54:56,280 --> 00:55:02,799
witnessed that yeah I

1352
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:04,720
bet it's out there every day both sides

1353
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:07,240
of the aisle believe their food choices

1354
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:11,559
now make them spiritually

1355
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:13,000
enlightened okay so here's how it goes

1356
00:55:11,559 --> 00:55:14,040
with the spiritual enlightenment which

1357
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:16,079
is

1358
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:17,359
interesting I mean you see people out

1359
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:18,880
there you can have somebody that they go

1360
00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:20,880
plant-based they go

1361
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:23,000
vegan they start doing all this

1362
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:24,480
meditating they start changing their

1363
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:27,200
lives they're doing their yoga they're

1364
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:29,440
doing everything everything and suddenly

1365
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:31,839
now they're spiritually

1366
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:33,960
enlightened right and you would hope

1367
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:36,240
they're spiritually enlightened they're

1368
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:38,319
plant-based they're doing yoga they're

1369
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:40,400
taking care of themselves you would hope

1370
00:55:38,319 --> 00:55:42,440
that they're spiritually enlightened but

1371
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:44,039
then what if there's somebody and

1372
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:46,920
they're just an

1373
00:55:44,039 --> 00:55:48,680
[ __ ] seriously because there's plenty

1374
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:50,440
of them out there I mean did you ever

1375
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:52,760
run into somebody that's just like they

1376
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:55,119
weren't really a nice person and they

1377
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:56,280
kind of like they betrayed you or they

1378
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:57,799
said something terrible they say

1379
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:59,640
terrible things to you there's people

1380
00:55:57,799 --> 00:56:01,200
that get abused by people all the time

1381
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:03,880
out there right there's people that are

1382
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:08,520
gas lit by people all the time out there

1383
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:10,240
okay so are they spiritually enlightened

1384
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:13,200
CU I'm confused I scratched my head on

1385
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:14,599
that one so everybody in a yoga class

1386
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:16,839
every single person and I'm not anti-

1387
00:56:14,599 --> 00:56:19,119
yoga I love when people do yoga the

1388
00:56:16,839 --> 00:56:21,000
point is everybody's everybody that's in

1389
00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:24,240
a yoga class say there's 50 people in a

1390
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:27,079
yoga class every all 50 of them are

1391
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:28,640
doing yoga they're doing their Machi te

1392
00:56:27,079 --> 00:56:31,119
they're taking care of themselves

1393
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:33,240
they're they're watching what they eat

1394
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:36,920
they're like into all kinds of cool

1395
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:39,079
stuff all 50 are spiritually enlightened

1396
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:41,440
all 50 people in the yoga studio would

1397
00:56:39,079 --> 00:56:44,079
never stab somebody in the back every

1398
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:46,599
last of one of those all 50 would would

1399
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:48,240
be unconditional to other people would

1400
00:56:46,599 --> 00:56:49,680
never turn against them would never turn

1401
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:51,880
against a friend would never let

1402
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:54,119
somebody down would never be an [ __ ]

1403
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:56,079
to somebody so every single person in

1404
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:57,920
that yoga class all 50 are spiritually

1405
00:56:56,079 --> 00:57:00,400
enlightened and would never hurt

1406
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:02,160
anybody I find that hard to believe

1407
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:03,400
there's bad people there's good people

1408
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,680
you see it out there and there's

1409
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:05,760
terrible things that happen every day

1410
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:08,920
out

1411
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:11,799
there and you can have a bad person with

1412
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:15,160
a cold heart doing terrible things

1413
00:57:11,799 --> 00:57:18,200
eating just right a little bowl of

1414
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:21,079
berries a little dollop of yogur yogurt

1415
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:23,799
on there or whatever anything like that

1416
00:57:21,079 --> 00:57:26,640
you can have a person that's just you

1417
00:57:23,799 --> 00:57:28,720
know eating what somewhat clean and

1418
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:29,720
doing like what seems like all this

1419
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:32,079
great

1420
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:33,520
stuff and they're eating say plant-based

1421
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:35,720
or animal based and they're doing it

1422
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:36,920
really good and then they're also mean

1423
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:39,960
and they're mean-hearted and they're

1424
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:42,640
cold blooded and they just let people

1425
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:45,000
down and do terrible things that's just

1426
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:45,000
how it

1427
00:57:46,599 --> 00:57:51,920
works both sides believe very much that

1428
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:55,720
they're different than the other

1429
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:58,640
side I talk to plant-based people

1430
00:57:55,720 --> 00:58:01,240
right that are in the movement and they

1431
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:03,319
believe they are so different than the

1432
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:06,400
animal- based

1433
00:58:03,319 --> 00:58:10,400
people so different and I talk to

1434
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:12,839
animal- based people right that are like

1435
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:15,119
out there in the health

1436
00:58:12,839 --> 00:58:16,599
movement and they're doing stuff out

1437
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:18,680
there and they're known in the health

1438
00:58:16,599 --> 00:58:21,440
movement I talk to them and they believe

1439
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:23,839
they're so different than the other

1440
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:27,559
side but it's laughable because they're

1441
00:58:23,839 --> 00:58:27,559
not they're they're very much

1442
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:32,920
alike they are the same side the same

1443
00:58:30,839 --> 00:58:35,039
belief systems and they shop at the same

1444
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:37,760
markets to get their

1445
00:58:35,039 --> 00:58:40,559
food and the only difference is that one

1446
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:43,160
eats meat and the other

1447
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:46,440

00:59:09,079 --> 00:59:14,799
lot of agendas out

1458
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:18,520
there and it's not about the chronically

1459
00:59:14,799 --> 00:59:21,039
sick it's just about how people can

1460
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:24,920
move you know

1461
00:59:21,039 --> 00:59:27,640
up in the world of The Healing Art

1462
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:31,200
wasn't like this 30 years ago so much it

1463
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:34,960
wasn't like this 20 years ago but right

1464
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:37,359
now there's this game on kind of thing

1465
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:40,240
people are stepping on people and

1466
00:59:37,359 --> 00:59:42,799
they're doing everything they can to

1467
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:46,440
just climb up in the ranks of the

1468
00:59:42,799 --> 00:59:49,920
alternative social media market and

1469
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:51,920
they're running hundreds of ads and

1470
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:55,319
they're they're spending millions of

1471
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:57,400
dollars a month believe it or not yeah

1472
00:59:55,319 --> 01:00:00,920
and they're doing all of this so they

1473
00:59:57,400 --> 01:00:04,599
can be like I'm your Guru I'm your

1474
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:06,680
Guru and while all that's happening

1475
01:00:04,599 --> 01:00:10,880
there's this food war going on about

1476
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:12,799
belief systems in the mix and in the end

1477
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:14,520
nobody cares about The Chronic Leo I

1478
01:00:12,799 --> 01:00:17,319
could see it out there I see it out

1479
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:18,720
there every day they don't really care

1480
01:00:17,319 --> 01:00:21,160
they want you to be

1481
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:22,760
fine they want your health to be just

1482
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:24,799
good enough to just buy all their

1483
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:26,359
programs or whatever it is and or

1484
01:00:24,799 --> 01:00:28,799
whatever it is they selling and they

1485
01:00:26,359 --> 01:00:30,799
want you to just be you just do it and

1486
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:32,599
shut up and no

1487
01:00:30,799 --> 01:00:34,480
complaints because they don't want to

1488
01:00:32,599 --> 01:00:36,920
know that you're so sick and you tried

1489
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:39,760
everything and it's not working they

1490
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:42,000
don't want to know that and they don't

1491
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:43,760
understand the exposures and the history

1492
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:46,480
of somebody and what they've been

1493
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:48,400
through I mean they're poaching mm info

1494
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:50,119
and acting like they're they do know

1495
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:52,640

1497
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:58,880
don't and it's it's just crazy

1498
01:00:56,520 --> 01:01:00,680
crazy if you're not aware of what's

1499
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:03,240
Happening you can be tricked and

1500
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:05,799

1502
01:01:05,799 --> 01:01:11,480

1506
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:22,720
pour in and it's people being confused

1507
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:24,839
and they're just like I was just told

1508
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:27,440
that celery juice is bad for me and when

1509
01:01:24,839 --> 01:01:29,079
you look into it the person that told

1510
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:30,960
them that Cel is bad for them are

1511
01:01:29,079 --> 01:01:34,559
selling these like

1512
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:35,960
programs these multi-tiered programs and

1513
01:01:34,559 --> 01:01:38,039
they're and they're doing all this other

1514
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:40,079
stuff it's actually

1515
01:01:38,039 --> 01:01:40,920
deranged and that's what's happening out

1516
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:43,440
there you

1517
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:45,280
guys but look my job is to be a

1518
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:47,960
messenger to just tell people who are

1519
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:50,440
chronically sick okay about this

1520
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:54,760
information out there and how it's

1521
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:57,640
rigged because [ __ ] is rigged out there

1522
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:59,760
see PC says I saw an influencer the

1523
01:01:57,640 --> 01:02:02,160
other day he claims that all physical

1524
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:04,240
illness can be healed with positive

1525
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:06,680
thoughts

1526
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:09,279
alone positive thoughts are

1527
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:11,400
critical we don't want negative thoughts

1528
01:02:09,279 --> 01:02:14,359
eating our brain

1529
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:18,920
away they're not good for

1530
01:02:14,359 --> 01:02:21,279
us but when someone's sick with chronic

1531
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:22,680
illness it doesn't mean that all these

1532
01:02:21,279 --> 01:02:25,000
positive thoughts are going to be the

1533
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:28,279
answer to get them out of bed

1534
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:31,880
it can be critical to sustain help

1535
01:02:28,279 --> 01:02:35,039
sustain them positive thoughts is

1536
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:37,760
important but I've seen people where

1537
01:02:35,039 --> 01:02:40,160
like moms that have kids that are so

1538
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:43,440
sick with chronic illness you guys and

1539
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:47,279
the kids like the moms will tell me how

1540
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:50,240
positive the kids are and all they do is

1541
01:02:47,279 --> 01:02:51,920
positive mantras and and happy thoughts

1542
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:53,920
while they're sick and

1543
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:55,520
suffering but they're sick and they're

1544
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:57,680
sick and

1545
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:59,880
suffering because there's so many other

1546
01:02:57,680 --> 01:03:02,680
things involved it's not negative

1547
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:05,000
thoughts don't make

1548
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:07,160
somebody sick with autoimmune and

1549
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:10,680
chronic illness and fibromyalgia and

1550
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:13,319
hashimotos thyroiditis and ra and lupus

1551
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:14,839
and every symptom in between a negative

1552
01:03:13,319 --> 01:03:18,319
thought doesn't do

1553
01:03:14,839 --> 01:03:20,240
that but yes positive thoughts are got

1554
01:03:18,319 --> 01:03:23,279
to have positive

1555
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:26,359
thoughts yeah totally get it what you

1556
01:03:23,279 --> 01:03:28,920
said youy guys all right check out

1557
01:03:26,359 --> 01:03:31,839
medical mean podcast at Apple podcast I

1558
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:33,559
put out three new episodes recently you

1559
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:36,240
probably already listened maybe you guys

1560
01:03:33,559 --> 01:03:39,559
didn't some of you check it out onig

1561
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:41,880
vegan is not based on us it's based on

1562
01:03:39,559 --> 01:03:41,880
the

1563
01:03:43,599 --> 01:03:49,799
animals so it's a lot of different ways

1564
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:53,279
to think about that one right

1565
01:03:49,799 --> 01:03:54,880
there so so vegan is not based on us

1566
01:03:53,279 --> 01:03:59,520
it's based on animals

1567
01:03:54,880 --> 01:04:02,640
animal so many people who claim that

1568
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:08,000
they are vegan run back to eating

1569
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:10,039
animals every single day um this is

1570
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:12,119
Infamous

1571
01:04:10,039 --> 01:04:13,319
Infamous if that's the word of choice

1572
01:04:12,119 --> 01:04:17,640
for this that

1573
01:04:13,319 --> 01:04:20,480
works but so many plant-based people got

1574
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:23,559
sick and then they ran back to eggs that

1575
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:25,920
was the first thing they went back to is

1576
01:04:23,559 --> 01:04:27,119
eggs

1577
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:28,359
and they're screaming that you have to

1578
01:04:27,119 --> 01:04:31,559
be on

1579
01:04:28,359 --> 01:04:35,200
eggs I'm not anti- plant-based I'm not

1580
01:04:31,559 --> 01:04:38,720
anti-animal I'm anti-

1581
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:43,160
misinformation I'm anti- lacking

1582
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:45,880
tools I'm anti missing the

1583
01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:48,920
knowledge and so you can heal

1584
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:53,200
plant-based and you can heal animal

1585
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:57,799
protein you can heal and medical medium

1586
01:04:53,200 --> 01:05:02,520
info is so laxidasical

1587
01:04:57,799 --> 01:05:05,440
in the sense where you can come into it

1588
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:08,160
and try any of the tools and customize

1589
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:11,039
it to what you want to do in your life

1590
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:13,440
that's how unbelievable it is it's not

1591
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:15,640
this one thing just got to do it this

1592
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:17,799
way and it's one size fits

1593
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:20,760
all it's the

1594
01:05:17,799 --> 01:05:23,400
only thing out

1595
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:25,920
there that you can come into it any way

1596
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:28,119
you want and just start applying it and

1597
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:30,520
take it as far as you want to go even if

1598
01:05:28,119 --> 01:05:33,640
they say they are vegan and they did it

1599
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:36,480
just for the animals not their health

1600
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:39,960
the minute they get sick or too many

1601
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:41,680
symptoms they run back to eating animals

1602
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:45,079
and they run back to their doctors for

1603
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:47,839
antibiotics to boot this is exactly what

1604
01:05:45,079 --> 01:05:50,920
has happened every day and still does

1605
01:05:47,839 --> 01:05:52,799
even people that go plant-based because

1606
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:54,920
of it I can't tell you how many times

1607
01:05:52,799 --> 01:05:56,440
I've seen people that were plant-based

1608
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:58,079
that started eating animal products

1609
01:05:56,440 --> 01:06:00,160
again and you know what they told me

1610
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:02,160
they told me that they they were vegan

1611
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:04,440
because they didn't want to hurt animals

1612
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:07,119
all of that but because they're sick

1613
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:09,400
they their body needed the protein I

1614
01:06:07,119 --> 01:06:12,400
swear to

1615
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:14,720
God I heard that so many times if I had

1616
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:18,960
a feather for every time I heard that I

1617
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:20,920
would be able to fly that's how many

1618
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:22,680
times I've heard that from vegans and

1619
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:24,559
plant-based people that were vegan and

1620
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:27,119
plant-based because they were you they

1621
01:06:24,559 --> 01:06:29,839
didn't want to eat any animals and they

1622
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:31,839
were against that and again against

1623
01:06:29,839 --> 01:06:34,559
animal testing rightfully so they didn't

1624
01:06:31,839 --> 01:06:37,279
want to eat any animals and then they

1625
01:06:34,559 --> 01:06:40,319
used they actually got sick and they

1626
01:06:37,279 --> 01:06:42,880
used the whole protein thing to justify

1627
01:06:40,319 --> 01:06:44,520
it in their mind that their body was

1628
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:46,000
missing protein that must be why they're

1629
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:47,359
sick so they started eating animal

1630
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:50,039
products

1631
01:06:47,359 --> 01:06:52,680
again oh my God have you heard someone

1632
01:06:50,039 --> 01:06:54,599
do that yet I mean I've heard so many

1633
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:58,440
not judging them

1634
01:06:54,599 --> 01:06:58,440
but I've heard it and I've seen it out

1635
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:06,760
there and I've seen a lot more than

1636
01:07:07,599 --> 01:07:11,599
that another thing too is restrictions

1637
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:13,799
like

1638
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:16,520
restriction diets and stuff you know

1639
01:07:13,799 --> 01:07:18,880
what you know what restriction

1640
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:20,599
is I'll give you a couple things you

1641
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:22,400
know with that oh also I want to say

1642
01:07:20,599 --> 01:07:24,480
this also behind closed doors people

1643
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:25,559
don't always do what they should on

1644
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:28,279
social

1645
01:07:25,559 --> 01:07:29,640
media even if they say they are vegan

1646
01:07:28,279 --> 01:07:32,520
and they say they did it just for

1647
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:35,480
Animals yes even if they say they're

1648
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:37,720
vegan or they say they're animal basted

1649
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:40,319
and they're doing it a certain way it

1650
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:43,279
doesn't mean behind closed doors that it

1651
01:07:40,319 --> 01:07:46,039
isn't different like the fly on the wall

1652
01:07:43,279 --> 01:07:49,640
if you could be that fly on the wall and

1653
01:07:46,039 --> 01:07:54,279
see what some people do after what

1654
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:57,440
they've said you would be like oh my God

1655
01:07:54,279 --> 01:08:01,079
you can do a TV show on that

1656
01:07:57,440 --> 01:08:03,000
stuff easily a whole series on everybody

1657
01:08:01,079 --> 01:08:05,160
saying one thing and then behind closed

1658
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:09,480
doors they're doing something different

1659
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:12,839
it would be a hit show and a hit

1660
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:16,159
series and it happens every

1661
01:08:12,839 --> 01:08:20,440
day Tara fruit fear restriction is

1666
01:08:27,719 --> 01:08:31,839
carnivore that's restriction you didn't

1667
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:33,000
think the carnivore died restriction you

1668
01:08:31,839 --> 01:08:36,080
know what's happening to the carnivore

1669
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:37,880
diet it's actually blown to shreds I

1670
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:40,279
predicted it years

1671
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:42,640
ago I think I haven't even on I have it

1672
01:08:40,279 --> 01:08:44,600
on video I predicted it where it would

1673
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:46,799
fall apart because you can't just live

1674
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:49,279
on meat you can't just live on this and

1675
01:08:46,799 --> 01:08:51,400
this only so they started adding things

1676
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:54,159
they added like lemon and then they

1677
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:57,040
added like honey and then they add it

1678
01:08:54,159 --> 01:09:00,359
like berries this carnivore diet is now

1679
01:08:57,040 --> 01:09:03,040
a keto diet carnivore diet is now back

1680
01:09:00,359 --> 01:09:04,759
back is now an Atkins diet that's what

1681
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:07,520
the carnivore diet turned into it's

1682
01:09:04,759 --> 01:09:10,600
crazy now they're adding orange juice to

1683
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:12,440
the carnivore diet so the carnivore diet

1684
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:14,839
is basically what gets this

1685
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:16,520
crazy and they're adding fruits now to

1686
01:09:14,839 --> 01:09:19,000
the carnivore diet there is no carnivore

1687
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:20,719
diet you might get a few people left

1688
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:24,440
over and they're bumping in the walls

1689
01:09:20,719 --> 01:09:26,000
they like I'm only on meat I can't I

1690
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:28,679
don't have any energy

1691
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:30,719
anymore and they're bumping in the

1692
01:09:28,679 --> 01:09:33,159
walls you might have two or three of

1693
01:09:30,719 --> 01:09:35,239
them left but everybody left carnivore

1694
01:09:33,159 --> 01:09:36,199

1705
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:09,000
