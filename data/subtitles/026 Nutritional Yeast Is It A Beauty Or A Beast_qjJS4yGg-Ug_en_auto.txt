[1.32 - 7.76] how many people do you know who struggle
[4.32 - 10.24] with their health chances are whether
[7.76 - 14.52] they show it or not most of the people
[10.24 - 17.60] in your life do and chances are you're
[14.52 - 21.40] one of them whether you're dealing with

[25.92 - 31.24] fatigue or any other symptom or
[28.48 - 34.52] condition you're far from from
[31.24 - 38.64] alone living with symptoms has become
[34.52 - 41.76] The New Normal so no more guessing games
[38.64 - 45.56] it's time to get answers welcome to the
[41.76 - 48.28] medical medium podcast I'm Anthony
[45.56 - 50.84] Williams we're talking about nutritional
[48.28 - 54.56] yeast now I'm not trying to get the
[50.84 - 57.12] nutritional yeast people upset God knows
[54.56 - 60.48] it may happen when they hear what I got
[57.12 - 64.24] to say but this is about the chronically
[60.48 - 67.56] ill and we got to put aside all those
[64.24 - 70.12] bad feelings because we have to remember
[67.56 - 73.16] there's somebody sick out there laying
[70.12 - 76.20] in their bed putting things inside their
[73.16 - 79.08] body and it's important that they know
[76.20 - 82.16] what it is now the yeast world isn't
[79.08 - 85.76] just black and white there's a gray area
[82.16 - 88.84] to be had get ready fasten your seat

[173.84 - 180.76] yeast loves their nutritional yeast
[177.88 - 184.00] everybody who eats nutrition East
[180.76 - 188.04] without knowing it's nutritional East
[184.00 - 190.64] loves their nutritional East see it's in
[188.04 - 192.80] a lot of packaged food it's an
[190.64 - 195.12] ingredient that's added to a lot of
[192.80 - 197.28] different chips a lot of different corn
[195.12 - 200.68] Puffs and different kinds of rice puffs
[197.28 - 202.60] and everything else it's like a batter
[200.68 - 204.08] you know like a batter you know when
[202.60 - 206.56] you're like putting batter on some
[204.08 - 209.32] chicken or some fried chicken you roll
[206.56 - 213.48] it in batter it's like rolling it in egg
[209.32 - 216.84] and that just kind of gooey wheat flour
[213.48 - 218.00] batter drop it in a frying pan it's like
[216.84 - 222.44] having this
[218.00 - 224.96] coding and it tastes so yummy now you
[222.44 - 226.40] may be like I had never had it I don't
[224.96 - 230.52] eat nutritional
[226.40 - 232.68] yeast yeah you had it you had it there's
[230.52 - 234.32] no question it's in so many different
[232.68 - 237.12] things all you got to do is just buy a
[234.32 - 239.80] hummus chances are it's going to be in
[237.12 - 241.80] the hummus all you have to do is buy a
[239.80 - 245.20] hummus behind the deli counter that was
[241.80 - 246.76] pre-made in any store they scoop it out
[245.20 - 249.00] they put it in a container it's like
[246.76 - 250.92] here you go sir thank you can't wait to
[249.00 - 252.96] put some chips in there it could be
[250.92 - 255.72] loaded with nutritional yeast and
[252.96 - 259.44] usually is my friend got me a bag of
[255.72 - 261.12] kale chips I was like oh cool kale chips
[259.44 - 262.88] I said thanks man I really appreciate it
[261.12 - 264.72] like no problem he opened up the bag he
[262.88 - 268.16] was eating it he's like these are so
[264.72 - 271.36] good like I bet they are I bet they're
[268.16 - 274.48] good flip over the pack man he flipped
[271.36 - 276.72] it over and he was like crunching and
[274.48 - 280.44] like sunflower
[276.72 - 284.32] oil olive oil nutritional
[280.44 - 287.36] yeast natural flavors I said wait did
[284.32 - 290.40] you did you read that goes what go
[287.36 - 292.36] nutritional yeast natural flavors too
[290.40 - 295.48] but that's another story but nutritional
[292.36 - 297.24] yeast he was like what is that yeast
[295.48 - 300.24] like the kind of baker's yeast I was go
[297.24 - 302.44] no no no no it's different than that so
[300.24 - 305.60] he said it's got to be good for you
[302.44 - 309.64] right I mean it's a health food it hits
[305.60 - 312.76] all the marks it's non GMO I'm like yeah
[309.64 - 315.12] yeah it says that on the bag glutenfree
[312.76 - 318.76] yeah says it on the bag no additive
[315.12 - 321.76] preservatives uh-huh but I said to him
[318.76 - 324.44] it's not as good as you think it is it's
[321.76 - 328.24] not as good for people to eat as they
[324.44 - 330.84] think it is but he said kale Kale's
[328.24 - 333.52] amazing right I mean it's incredible I
[330.84 - 337.72] said Kale's incredible Kale's amazing
[333.52 - 339.52] for you yeah but it's dressed up to be
[337.72 - 341.56] something more than just kale it's got
[339.52 - 343.92] the nutritional yeast in it he goes okay
[341.56 - 347.20] okay okay just tell me what's wrong with
[343.92 - 349.84] the nutritional yeast so there's little
[347.20 - 353.80] things about nutritional yeast that
[349.84 - 356.68] aren't good and there's bigger things
[353.80 - 357.72] about nutritional yeast that aren't good
[356.68 - 361.00] we're going to start with the little
[357.72 - 364.04] ones the nutritional yeast World hangs
[361.00 - 366.80] their hat on the nutrition aspect of
[364.04 - 368.80] nutritional yeast the nutrients like
[366.80 - 370.40] you'll hear out there well it's got a
[368.80 - 372.20] lot of vitamins it's got a lot of
[370.40 - 375.00] minerals in there it's got a lot of
[372.20 - 377.20] nutrients and it's like whoa I'm sold
[375.00 - 379.20] right there and the nutritional yeast
[377.20 - 381.36] World they got to be in it for the
[379.20 - 382.92] goodness of everything the well-being of
[381.36 - 385.68] everything because there's a lot of
[382.92 - 388.32] nutrients in there and so that's the hat
[385.68 - 391.04] right there they hang up on the hook so
[388.32 - 393.56] it's this nutrient profile that makes it
[391.04 - 395.88] really intriguing because you think
[393.56 - 398.04] about it there's vitamins there's
[395.88 - 400.72] nutrients there's minerals in there
[398.04 - 403.60] where can you go wrong and that's the
[400.72 - 406.84] whole point of nutritional yeast it's
[403.60 - 409.40] yeast that happens to create
[406.84 - 413.24] nutrients and so the nutrients inside
[409.40 - 415.96] nutritional yeast are good for us so if
[413.24 - 418.76] we're sick and unhealthy and have
[415.96 - 421.32] problems this seems like a viable source
[418.76 - 424.16] of nutrients to help our health and
[421.32 - 426.96] well-being it's kind of an easy cell
[424.16 - 428.88] it's like whoa nutritional yeast it's
[426.96 - 430.36] loaded with vitamin A it's got some B's
[428.88 - 433.64] in there it's got some different
[430.36 - 436.36] nutrients this is perfect I need that
[433.64 - 438.28] right now because I'm kind of sick I
[436.36 - 441.40] don't feel good I'm always into my
[438.28 - 446.64] health I'm looking for things to help me
[441.40 - 449.36] so this works and whoa it tastes really
[446.64 - 451.60] good so what's my problem withut
[449.36 - 454.12] nutritional yeast all the nutrients it
[451.60 - 455.20] has that's awesome think about it that's
[454.12 - 458.16] really
[455.20 - 461.72] incredible well to begin with it's not
[458.16 - 464.16] that many nutrients that's just a start
[461.72 - 467.48] because it's not as packed it's not as
[464.16 - 470.44] dense the amounts of nutrients aren't
[467.48 - 473.56] high that alone is tricky you can eat
[470.44 - 476.00] one orange and you supersede it what
[473.56 - 480.04] nutritional yeast could ever offer you
[476.00 - 483.32] if you eat one banana one tomato
[480.04 - 486.60] one artichoke one asparagus you
[483.32 - 491.44] superseded those nutrients and then some
[486.60 - 494.40] quadruple Su tfold 20 fold a piece of
[491.44 - 497.12] kale you blew nutritional yeast out of
[494.40 - 499.88] the water the nutrient profile in the
[497.12 - 502.12] nutritional yeast could not even stand
[499.88 - 505.32] up to one leaf of
[502.12 - 508.60] spinach one leaf of spinach the nutrient
[505.32 - 509.88] profile through the roof nutritional
[508.60 - 514.36] yeast
[509.88 - 518.08] not really at all it's so mild part of
[514.36 - 521.00] why they fortify it a lot of companies
[518.08 - 524.20] fortify it they add you know like white
[521.00 - 528.40] bread processed white bread they got to
[524.20 - 531.04] fortify it you got to enrich it it's
[528.40 - 534.72] enriching that's what the companies do
[531.04 - 537.04] the big manufacturers do so big
[534.72 - 540.48] manufacturers they throw a whole bunch
[537.04 - 543.72] of bulk vitamins in into the nutritional
[540.48 - 545.84] yeast because in the end there really
[543.72 - 548.64] isn't a lot of vitamins in the
[545.84 - 551.88] nutritional yeast so they got to fortify
[548.64 - 554.80] it just like white bread look I know the
[551.88 - 557.60] deeper I get into this episode the more
[554.80 - 560.08] friends I lose I understand that when it
[557.60 - 562.56] comes down to n people are highly
[560.08 - 565.08] protective over their n but let's go to
[562.56 - 567.68] the other little problem I have so this
[565.08 - 569.80] one's a little different think about
[567.68 - 573.24] this yeast
[569.80 - 575.36] is not a plant right now I know there's
[573.24 - 578.00] a lot of plant-based people out there
[575.36 - 580.44] they want to eat plants I know there's a
[578.00 - 583.60] lot of animal protein people out there
[580.44 - 585.48] that want to eat plants you want to eat
[583.60 - 588.48] your animal proteins if you're an animal
[585.48 - 591.48] protein person and your plants and if
[588.48 - 596.80] you're vegan or plant-based you want to
[591.48 - 599.72] have your plants and your plants right
[596.80 - 602.28] so where does the yeast come in that's
[599.72 - 605.16] not a plant why are we getting all
[602.28 - 607.80] excited about it why are we supporting
[605.16 - 610.36] it so much why are we fighting for it so
[607.80 - 615.76] much it's not a
[610.36 - 618.00] plant plants are medicine plant food
[615.76 - 619.32] medicine right if you believe animal
[618.00 - 621.40] products are medicine because you eat
[619.32 - 625.40] animal products well there you go you
[621.40 - 627.40] can say that too but where's the yeast
[625.40 - 629.92] what's going on with that see that's a
[627.40 - 631.68] fungus that's fungi
[629.92 - 634.68] that's not a
[631.68 - 637.40] plant oh I get it wait wait wait wait
[634.68 - 640.24] wait you're thinking mushrooms now think
[637.40 - 642.00] like what's this guy talking about fungi
[640.24 - 647.48] yeast it's a
[642.00 - 652.36] mushroom no it's not it's different a
[647.48 - 654.08] mushroom doesn't feed off of bad
[652.36 - 656.32] things a
[654.08 - 661.08] mushroom doesn't
[656.32 - 665.40] feed off of Bad Things things in order
[661.08 - 670.04] to survive an edible mushroom so edible
[665.40 - 673.72] mushrooms don't feed off of Highly toxic
[670.04 - 675.52] substances in order to survive a yeast
[673.72 - 679.48] will and then you're thinking well wait
[675.52 - 681.16] a minute the yeast nutritional yeast is
[679.48 - 685.48] feeding off of
[681.16 - 688.36] beets so that's not a highly toxic thing
[685.48 - 690.16] it's feeding off of beets that shouldn't
[688.36 - 693.24] be a problem
[690.16 - 695.88] it's a really big problem I told you you
[693.24 - 699.16] better fasten your seat bels so now
[695.88 - 702.24] let's talk about this a bit an edible
[699.16 - 706.84] mushroom doesn't just care about
[702.24 - 710.20] itself an edible mushroom knows
[706.84 - 713.72] someone's going to feed off of it a wild
[710.20 - 716.56] animal an animal in the woods a certain
[713.72 - 720.04] variety of insect specifically large
[716.56 - 724.48] insects too people
[720.04 - 728.40] humans it doesn't grow for itself edible
[724.48 - 731.52] mushrooms grow for the person they grow
[728.40 - 735.16] for human life animal life to
[731.52 - 738.60] consume yeast grows for
[735.16 - 742.08] itself it devours what it wants for
[738.60 - 746.56] itself and it doesn't matter if what it
[742.08 - 749.36] devours is extremely highly toxic sure
[746.56 - 752.28] we can take yeast and we can throw it on
[749.36 - 755.16] something that's not highly highly toxic
[752.28 - 759.28] and it'll feed off of it but it will
[755.16 - 763.60] feed off of it only for itself not for
[759.28 - 767.80] consumption of itself not for an animal
[763.60 - 770.92] or a human to feed off of but wait wait
[767.80 - 776.04] wait wait you got me you think you got
[770.92 - 778.40] me candida candida I talk about that you
[776.04 - 782.28] know it's inside our intestinal tract it
[778.40 - 785.96] feeds off of things right but you're not
[782.28 - 786.88] supposed to be scraping someone's colon
[785.96 - 790.04] of
[786.88 - 791.76] candida and eating it you're not
[790.04 - 794.16] supposed to be scraping out your own
[791.76 - 796.64] candida or somebody else's candida out
[794.16 - 799.56] of their intestinal track trying to grow
[796.64 - 802.12] it so you can package it up and then
[799.56 - 804.72] sprinkle it on all the food you want eat
[802.12 - 806.60] it every single day hey I got my candido
[804.72 - 808.60] over here you guys I got a big bag of it
[806.60 - 809.40] you want it on your popcorn let me put
[808.60 - 812.56] on
[809.40 - 815.36] hey you guys did you get your popcorn I
[812.56 - 820.08] got a whole big bucket of candida right
[815.36 - 822.56] here came out of a a a guy down the road
[820.08 - 824.56] he said he would grow it for me so he
[822.56 - 827.68] kept on eating all this crappy food and
[824.56 - 830.08] he's just yes candida was Goblin all
[827.68 - 832.08] that garbage he was eating all that
[830.08 - 834.96] stuff in his gut and he had so much
[832.08 - 837.92] candida that you know he had a a
[834.96 - 840.44] physician scrape it out and a colon
[837.92 - 843.44] hydrotherapist uh get it out and then
[840.44 - 845.20] they grew it I got barrels of this stuff
[843.44 - 847.60] man it's better than nutritional yeast
[845.20 - 850.32] you got to try this hey bring your
[847.60 - 852.60] popcorn over here okay here here it goes
[850.32 - 856.52] what do you think it's good right it's
[852.60 - 858.48] real good if you think that a portella
[856.52 - 861.08] mushroom you know the big old portabella
[858.48 - 863.00] mushrooms you buy in the store it's like
[861.08 - 864.36] honey I want to throw one on the grill
[863.00 - 866.44] I'm going to make everybody some
[864.36 - 869.40] portella mushrooms I got a whole package
[866.44 - 874.72] of them here if you think that the Cella
[869.40 - 877.96] mushroom is the same thing as yeast then
[874.72 - 880.48] you're terribly mistaken no disrespect
[877.96 - 883.52] but terribly mistaken so you might be
[880.48 - 886.60] somebody that's like he's wrong still
[883.52 - 889.20] all fungi fungi family they're all the
[886.60 - 892.40] same they're all doing the same thing
[889.20 - 894.48] he's wrong well let's take a look at the
[892.40 - 899.16] plants for a second so I said before
[894.48 - 902.64] plants are plants right fungi fungi okay
[899.16 - 905.52] I get it but not even all plants are the
[902.64 - 906.88] same so I'm scratching my head on this
[905.52 - 909.40] one
[906.88 - 911.20] because I just told my friend he can
[909.40 - 913.24] actually take all the poison ivy out of
[911.20 - 914.96] his yard he pulled it off of the oak
[913.24 - 920.16] tree and then picked it up all the
[914.96 - 923.36] ground and he had a barrel of poison ivy
[920.16 - 926.12] and I said since it's a plant it's the
[923.36 - 930.64] same thing he can do what he wants with
[926.12 - 933.16] it so he made a poison an ivy bed and he
[930.64 - 934.76] slept on it last night he said it was
[933.16 - 937.88] soft and comfortable he's in the
[934.76 - 941.56] hospital right now but the point is is
[937.88 - 944.08] that I think I made a mistake because I
[941.56 - 947.52] since it's a plant I told them it's all
[944.08 - 950.24] plants and he's a vegan by the way and
[947.52 - 952.04] this plants are all the same so because
[950.24 - 955.84] fungi are all the same too PTO Bell
[952.04 - 957.28] mushrooms same thing as yeast uh that's
[955.84 - 960.48] what everybody tells me out there all
[957.28 - 962.48] the Geniuses so so I I just figured the
[960.48 - 964.88] poison ivy is the same thing as
[962.48 - 966.76] asparagus and so he decided cuz it was
[964.88 - 969.12] really soft and comfortable he made this
[966.76 - 973.88] massive bed of poison IV and he slept on
[969.12 - 975.88] it last night and um his his partner and
[973.88 - 979.20] him are both in the hospital right now
[975.88 - 980.84] on steroids because the truth is yeast
[979.20 - 983.64] is not a
[980.84 - 987.16] mushroom that's the truth a big old
[983.64 - 990.60] portella mushroom a shant tril a button
[987.16 - 994.36] mushroom a baby Pella a bear's mushroom
[990.60 - 996.60] whatever it's not the same thing as
[994.36 - 999.36] yeast they're different
[996.60 - 1002.36] creatures oh wait I think somebody out
[999.36 - 1005.16] there has me again uh-oh they're saying
[1002.36 - 1007.56] well poison ivy yeah that's a poisonous
[1005.16 - 1011.96] plant duh it's not going to be an
[1007.56 - 1014.32] asparagus so um excuse me aw but
[1011.96 - 1017.48] nutritional yeast isn't poisonous we
[1014.32 - 1019.24] don't get poisoned when we eat it so got
[1017.48 - 1021.84] you there
[1019.24 - 1026.00] well all right let me just tell you this
[1021.84 - 1029.24] one now yeast is a cleaner upper it's a
[1026.00 - 1033.36] fungi that's there to clean and eat
[1029.24 - 1036.00] anything and everything okay poison ivy
[1033.36 - 1038.28] is a plant it's growing out of the
[1036.00 - 1039.80] ground same Earth as you can grow
[1038.28 - 1042.92] lettuce and everything else and you can
[1039.80 - 1044.84] have a garden with lettuce tomatoes
[1042.92 - 1046.68] cucumbers anything you want in there
[1044.84 - 1049.16] asparagus and then you can have poison
[1046.68 - 1050.52] ivy growing right out of that garden
[1049.16 - 1054.16] soil
[1050.52 - 1056.48] too yeast is a whole different Beast you
[1054.16 - 1059.48] can have that growing on something
[1056.48 - 1061.68] highly toxic even
[1059.48 - 1064.44] dangerous and it will
[1061.68 - 1067.08] grow right off of it and doesn't have a
[1064.44 - 1070.88] filter or a processing system like a big
[1067.08 - 1074.40] old mushroom portello can grow out of
[1070.88 - 1077.40] some poop but it will take in the good
[1074.40 - 1080.16] stuff to make it into a portabella
[1077.40 - 1083.60] mushroom same way a tomato plant can
[1080.16 - 1086.72] grow out of poop it'll take in the good
[1083.60 - 1089.52] stuff turn it into a juicy tomato and
[1086.72 - 1093.12] it's safe and you can eat
[1089.52 - 1095.00] it well yeast isn't like that yeast will
[1093.12 - 1096.56] grow off something highly toxic and if
[1095.00 - 1100.88] you eat that yeast you
[1096.56 - 1103.64] die okay nutritional yeast well it's not
[1100.88 - 1106.52] highly toxic and you can eat it and you
[1103.64 - 1108.88] don't die because they didn't throw that
[1106.52 - 1112.60] yeast onto something super high
[1108.88 - 1116.52] toxic but if they did there'd be no
[1112.60 - 1119.28] filter there'd be no body and no filter
[1116.52 - 1124.00] system it actually will grow and become
[1119.28 - 1125.20] as toxic to what it's growing on equal
[1124.00 - 1129.12] and that's a
[1125.20 - 1132.72] difference similar to snails and slugs
[1129.12 - 1135.56] snails and slugs don't have a filtration
[1132.72 - 1138.44] system they can feed off of something
[1135.56 - 1142.36] highly toxic and then if you eat that
[1138.44 - 1146.08] snail or eat that slug you can die now
[1142.36 - 1149.80] if a snail and a slug is not feeding off
[1146.08 - 1153.40] of foliage or any kind of waste that is
[1149.80 - 1155.24] highly toxic you can boil that snail and
[1153.40 - 1156.64] you can have your escargo or any kind of
[1155.24 - 1158.48] other snails there's so many different
[1156.64 - 1161.64] snails and varieties out there fresh
[1158.48 - 1164.52] water salt water whatever but if your
[1161.64 - 1168.28] snail is feeding on something that's not
[1164.52 - 1170.08] highly toxic and your slug slugs too are
[1168.28 - 1172.96] feeding on something that's not highly
[1170.08 - 1175.88] toxic you can then boil them up and eat
[1172.96 - 1178.76] them but that slug if you don't know
[1175.88 - 1183.40] where that slugs been if that slug was
[1178.76 - 1186.36] on some dangerous plants dangerous
[1183.40 - 1188.32] foliage dangerous sludge somewhere and
[1186.36 - 1190.80] you picked up that Slug and said whoa I
[1188.32 - 1192.84] know I can boil you and eat you you can
[1190.80 - 1195.44] you actually eat slugs and you go and
[1192.84 - 1198.28] boil it and eat it and then you die or
[1195.44 - 1200.80] get deathly ill because that slug didn't
[1198.28 - 1204.20] have filtration system and actually ate
[1200.80 - 1206.28] what was toxic stayed in it and it
[1204.20 - 1210.00] became highly toxic well that's what
[1206.28 - 1214.24] East can do so let's head now to what
[1210.00 - 1218.00] really bothers me like the big boy let's
[1214.24 - 1221.16] go there now okay yeast nutritional
[1218.00 - 1224.68] yeast is not toxic because you're eating
[1221.16 - 1226.72] it you got your yeast it's all good and
[1224.68 - 1230.16] I'm going to grab mine right
[1226.72 - 1231.60] now I got my nutritional use right here
[1230.16 - 1234.72] and you know what's interesting about
[1231.60 - 1236.16] this nutritional use bag that I have
[1234.72 - 1239.96] well it says n
[1236.16 - 1239.96] GMO n
[1241.40 - 1247.64] GMO I got peace in my heart peace in my
[1245.28 - 1250.28] mind peace in my soul I'm doing a little
[1247.64 - 1254.48] happy dance right here got my n GMO
[1250.28 - 1258.24] stuff going and uh that's just freaking
[1254.48 - 1262.76] awesome you know put wait I got a bomb
[1258.24 - 1265.76] to drop oh my God I just realized right
[1262.76 - 1270.40] now what a fool I've
[1265.76 - 1275.08] been stupid ass I am the primary food
[1270.40 - 1278.68] source for yeast nutritional yeast is
[1275.08 - 1279.84] GMO beats what the hell was I thinking
[1278.68 - 1282.64] all these
[1279.84 - 1285.68] years I've been gobbling this stuff by
[1282.64 - 1285.68] the truckloads
[1286.08 - 1293.72] man I just realized it just now this
[1289.24 - 1298.48] very second the primary source of food
[1293.72 - 1302.60] for the yeast to grow on is GMO beat
[1298.48 - 1304.92] it's sugary beats it's sugar beats like
[1302.60 - 1308.60] oh my God like
[1304.92 - 1310.04] du anyway you guys that's the big boy
[1308.60 - 1311.56] right there and I'm going to tell you
[1310.04 - 1317.28] something about that big boy that really
[1311.56 - 1318.96] scares me the yeast becomes what it eats
[1317.28 - 1323.52] you have to remember remember that yeah
[1318.96 - 1326.68] of course I get it on paper they can say
[1323.52 - 1328.84] technically it's not GMO so they can put
[1326.68 - 1330.52] that on the package they can put it
[1328.84 - 1332.64] right on there I'm grabbing the package
[1330.52 - 1336.40] again says n
[1332.64 - 1342.52] GMO that's interesting because all this
[1336.40 - 1344.96] yeast that grew grew on GMO beats whoa
[1342.52 - 1348.76] you guys are sneaky man you guys are
[1344.96 - 1350.12] really really sneaky the type of yeast
[1348.76 - 1354.24] they're using
[1350.12 - 1357.20] sacris is growing on GMO sugar beet
[1354.24 - 1358.04] remember when I said that yeast becomes
[1357.20 - 1361.96] what it
[1358.04 - 1367.24] eats that means nutritional yeast
[1361.96 - 1369.68] becomes that GMO product but Legally
[1367.24 - 1372.56] Legally they don't have to make that
[1369.68 - 1374.80] connection for you on the package they
[1372.56 - 1377.52] don't have to and they're not going to
[1374.80 - 1380.40] shut down their yeast factories just
[1377.52 - 1383.88] because of that minor little detail oh
[1380.40 - 1385.80] wait oh my God you think I'm wrong again
[1383.88 - 1388.96] because your nutritional East that
[1385.80 - 1391.92] you're eating it's growing on molasses
[1388.96 - 1396.16] they grow that one on molasses right so
[1391.92 - 1399.72] I must be wrong again molasses is sugar
[1396.16 - 1401.56] beat oh wait wait you got me again now I
[1399.72 - 1404.08] think I think he got me again right
[1401.56 - 1408.92] you're saying that the company you talk
[1404.08 - 1414.08] to the sugar beads they use aren't GMO
[1408.92 - 1416.60] oh really really all sugar beads are GMO
[1414.08 - 1419.24] cross-contamination has happened the
[1416.60 - 1421.08] majority of sugar beads used in
[1419.24 - 1424.00] nutritional yeast making and
[1421.08 - 1427.20] Manufacturing are 100%
[1424.00 - 1431.24] GMO the small portion of sugar beads
[1427.20 - 1432.40] that aren't 100% GMO are still 100% GMO
[1431.24 - 1434.72] by cross
[1432.40 - 1437.08] contamination the nutritional yeast
[1434.72 - 1439.00] factories their phones are going to be
[1437.08 - 1440.36] ringing off the hook after this podcast
[1439.00 - 1443.32] comes out and they're going to be
[1440.36 - 1446.68] telling everybody a really nice bedtime
[1443.32 - 1450.24] story they're going to say oh no no no
[1446.68 - 1452.80] no no not our Factory we have the best
[1450.24 - 1456.20] quality beets you've ever seen our
[1452.80 - 1457.96] nutritional yeast is all good and pure
[1456.20 - 1460.56] they're going to make you feel nice and
[1457.96 - 1462.04] good so you can keep your addiction
[1460.56 - 1464.36] strong and we're going to go into the
[1462.04 - 1466.32] addictive nature of it pretty soon but
[1464.36 - 1470.24] we still have some horror stories to
[1466.32 - 1474.08] tell with the GMO Factor now the problem
[1470.24 - 1477.56] with fungus yeast that type of fungus it
[1474.08 - 1478.92] has the ability to adapt change change
[1477.56 - 1483.24] its chemical
[1478.92 - 1486.04] structure change its nature to
[1483.24 - 1487.92] survive that's what yeast does that's
[1486.04 - 1490.88] why when someone has a yeast
[1487.92 - 1492.00] infection they go to the doctor they
[1490.88 - 1495.40] take an
[1492.00 - 1498.36] antifungal it goes away they get another
[1495.40 - 1499.80] yeast infection go to the doctor
[1498.36 - 1502.88] take the same
[1499.80 - 1505.56] antifungal and it's very tricky and
[1502.88 - 1507.92] stubborn and it doesn't go away and then
[1505.56 - 1511.44] they have to give that patient extra
[1507.92 - 1513.80] antifungal finally it goes away then
[1511.44 - 1516.80] they get another yeast infection go to
[1513.80 - 1520.12] the doctor and then they have to give
[1516.80 - 1522.16] them another type of antifungal because
[1520.12 - 1524.76] you can't use the other antifungals it
[1522.16 - 1527.52] adapted to those antifungals it
[1524.76 - 1528.64] acclimated it over roded it Rose above
[1527.52 - 1532.84] it
[1528.64 - 1535.60] yeast has an intelligence to save itself
[1532.84 - 1539.92] it has the ability to change so when
[1535.60 - 1543.92] it's on top of GMO food molasses GMO
[1539.92 - 1547.20] sugar beat it actually Alters itself
[1543.92 - 1550.84] because GMO foods are toxic they have
[1547.20 - 1552.36] toxins in them GMO toxins the yeast
[1550.84 - 1556.28] changes its
[1552.36 - 1558.60] structure it changes its actual cell
[1556.28 - 1562.40] structure but no no one's monitoring
[1558.60 - 1564.68] that no one cares just pump that stuff
[1562.40 - 1568.44] out to the masses have them eat it all
[1564.68 - 1571.32] they want more GMO sugar beets come in
[1568.44 - 1574.52] which is highly toxic because it's a GMO
[1571.32 - 1578.16] product and then the cell structure of
[1574.52 - 1581.04] the yeast changes and changes meanwhile
[1578.16 - 1583.04] no one's going to get $250 million the
[1581.04 - 1585.00] magic number to get a group of
[1583.04 - 1588.68] scientists together to take a little
[1585.00 - 1592.28] lucky L at what's going wrong like
[1588.68 - 1594.24] Frankenstein yeast Franken yeast no
[1592.28 - 1596.36] one's going to take a peek into it you
[1594.24 - 1599.76] know rosec colored glasses got to have
[1596.36 - 1601.32] them on rosecolor glasses call the
[1599.76 - 1603.00] nutritional yeast Factory and you're
[1601.32 - 1607.72] going to
[1603.00 - 1610.92] get nutritional yeast Factory here hello
[1607.72 - 1613.24] hello yes yes what's your concern
[1610.92 - 1616.36] customer uh
[1613.24 - 1618.44] GMO there's no GMO in our nutritional
[1616.36 - 1621.56] yeast huh
[1618.44 - 1623.96] what kind of talk is that I'm sorry are
[1621.56 - 1626.48] you saying that we're using GMO sugar
[1623.96 - 1629.80] beat well um
[1626.48 - 1633.00] maybe yeah and the and the yeast is
[1629.80 - 1635.40] growing off the sugar beat uh yes it's
[1633.00 - 1636.24] growing off our molasses yes yes our
[1635.40 - 1639.16] good
[1636.24 - 1641.40] molasses yes and and then uh what the
[1639.16 - 1644.08] yeast is turning into something you mean
[1641.40 - 1648.16] it's it's growing off the GMO and it's
[1644.08 - 1650.92] changing its cell structure the hogwash
[1648.16 - 1654.32] oh goash that doesn't even make any
[1650.92 - 1656.72] sense yes yes we have the Finest
[1654.32 - 1659.80] nutritional yeast there is we sell it to
[1656.72 - 1662.68] all great places health food stores use
[1659.80 - 1666.12] it I actually take it myself I like my
[1662.68 - 1668.36] nutritional yeast um I just don't really
[1666.12 - 1671.68] think there's a lot of Merit in this
[1668.36 - 1673.68] this uh this GMO thing we're not GMO we
[1671.68 - 1676.08] say it on the package we have every
[1673.68 - 1678.28] legal right to say it's not GMO on the
[1676.08 - 1681.28] package but yes
[1678.28 - 1682.96] well I believe oh we'll we'll bring this
[1681.28 - 1686.72] up in the next meeting and the next
[1682.96 - 1688.64] board meeting but I mean I listen I'll
[1686.72 - 1691.00] give you some free would you like a free
[1688.64 - 1693.60] order I'll give you a free order sent to
[1691.00 - 1697.60] your address would that make you feel
[1693.60 - 1701.56] better okay okay that's what we'll do
[1697.60 - 1704.12] see yeast doesn't like to die and yeast
[1701.56 - 1708.04] doesn't like to be challenged so when
[1704.12 - 1710.12] it's up against a predator like GMO
[1708.04 - 1712.64] because GMO foods are actually a
[1710.12 - 1718.08] predator food that's not a food to help
[1712.64 - 1720.36] nurture us help heal us help fortify us
[1718.08 - 1723.28] it's actually a predator food it's
[1720.36 - 1727.56] designed in a lab it's dangerous we know
[1723.28 - 1730.20] that about GMO food but fungus likes to
[1727.56 - 1732.88] rise above it when it's up against
[1730.20 - 1737.64] confrontation like that it changes its
[1732.88 - 1739.64] cell structure it changes how it thrives
[1737.64 - 1741.92] and how it grows because the yeast
[1739.64 - 1744.92] doesn't want to die it wants to live
[1741.92 - 1747.76] forever that's what yeast does that's
[1744.92 - 1749.48] why a baker with Baker yeast which is
[1747.76 - 1753.04] still yeast it's a little different but
[1749.48 - 1756.20] it's still yeast can keep yeast alive
[1753.04 - 1758.76] for a thousand years it can be in the
[1756.20 - 1761.20] lineage of somebody in their home and
[1758.76 - 1764.28] they can keep that yeast alive for
[1761.20 - 1767.08] centuries it could be centuries old
[1764.28 - 1769.56] yeast it doesn't like to die instead it
[1767.08 - 1772.28] likees to adapt and when you give it
[1769.56 - 1775.36] something toxic and dangerous to adapt
[1772.28 - 1779.44] to you don't have the same yeast you
[1775.36 - 1781.32] once had you have more of a
[1779.44 - 1785.00] non-world
[1781.32 - 1788.92] non-natural more of a super fungus just
[1785.00 - 1792.04] like a super bacteria like MCA but you
[1788.92 - 1795.76] end up with a super fungus fungus can
[1792.04 - 1798.08] alter its own cell structure so it never
[1795.76 - 1801.88] has to Forfeit a battle
[1798.08 - 1805.12] and die it won't succumb to the law of
[1801.88 - 1807.64] nature meaning the law of death it won't
[1805.12 - 1811.16] succumb to being poisoned by something
[1807.64 - 1813.96] unnatural and highly toxic instead it'll
[1811.16 - 1816.40] supersede it and that's when yeast turns
[1813.96 - 1819.80] into a Frankenstein yeast a Franken
[1816.40 - 1822.80] yeast and it holds that toxin Superior
[1819.80 - 1826.16] within itself it's being that GMO
[1822.80 - 1829.48] product and reproduces itself over and
[1826.16 - 1832.56] over again with that GMO product within
[1829.48 - 1834.84] itself and that leads to another scary
[1832.56 - 1838.48] thing kind of get ready for this one
[1834.84 - 1841.36] fast in your seat belts nutritional
[1838.48 - 1844.28] nutritional nutritional vitamins
[1841.36 - 1846.40] minerals nutrients we're eating the
[1844.28 - 1847.80] nutritional yeast because obviously
[1846.40 - 1849.52] we're addicted and we'll talk about the
[1847.80 - 1851.72] addiction part A little later but we're
[1849.52 - 1856.28] eating it too because we think it's good
[1851.72 - 1858.60] for us we keep on being told that it's
[1856.28 - 1861.72] packed with vitamins and minerals and
[1858.60 - 1864.36] nutrients so we say okay great this is
[1861.72 - 1868.08] nutritional it's got vitamin B it's got
[1864.36 - 1870.40] all this in it and this is great but no
[1868.08 - 1872.52] one's realizing
[1870.40 - 1876.04] something those are
[1872.52 - 1878.76] GMO vitamins and nutrients that's what
[1876.04 - 1881.36] nutrients those are the nutrients and
[1878.76 - 1885.96] vitamins that the yeast
[1881.36 - 1887.76] created from the GMO sugar beat becomes
[1885.96 - 1891.96] a GMO new
[1887.76 - 1895.04] nutrient GMO nutrients aren't fit for
[1891.96 - 1898.28] human consumption they're not fit for
[1895.04 - 1901.52] the human body our bodies can't thrive
[1898.28 - 1904.64] on those nutrients they don't help us
[1901.52 - 1907.32] heal they don't refill our
[1904.64 - 1912.96] deficiencies they help us become
[1907.32 - 1915.36] deficient GMO food pushes a person into
[1912.96 - 1917.88] deficient land into
[1915.36 - 1921.52] deficiencies the yeast is is growing off
[1917.88 - 1926.08] of the GMO sugar bead developing and
[1921.52 - 1928.60] creating its own Frankenstein vitamins
[1926.08 - 1930.84] and that's what we're consuming another
[1928.60 - 1934.68] thing which is really interesting
[1930.84 - 1938.04] there's no regulation determining that
[1934.68 - 1940.24] your yeast you're growing has to be on
[1938.04 - 1942.84] molasses GMO
[1940.24 - 1945.68] molasses you can grow your yeast on
[1942.84 - 1947.80] anything you choose as long as that
[1945.68 - 1950.64] yeast will feed on it
[1947.80 - 1955.28] grow you can then package it up and sell
[1950.64 - 1959.08] it so the gray area is really scary so
[1955.28 - 1962.84] yes the majority of the production is
[1959.08 - 1965.32] all about molasses which is GMO but
[1962.84 - 1967.48] there are some people out there they're
[1965.32 - 1970.32] picking anything they want to choose
[1967.48 - 1972.80] from doesn't matter what food it is GMO
[1970.32 - 1975.64] food for sure it could be anything it
[1972.80 - 1978.44] could be sewage it could be engine oil
[1975.64 - 1981.88] it can be petroleum
[1978.44 - 1984.24] petroleum ready it can be petroleum
[1981.88 - 1988.76] byproduct did you know that there is
[1984.24 - 1992.20] Baker yeasts that grow off of oil waste
[1988.76 - 1994.72] petroleum byproduct so that means
[1992.20 - 1996.88] anybody can legally do that you can open
[1994.72 - 1999.32] up a nutritional yeast Factory get a
[1996.88 - 2002.16] petroleum byproduct or something toxic
[1999.32 - 2004.20] like a sewage or a sludge from petroleum
[2002.16 - 2007.16] byproduct throw a whole bunch of yeast
[2004.20 - 2009.20] on it in it in your own of course
[2007.16 - 2012.32] sterile containers it doesn't matter you
[2009.20 - 2015.16] can still use the same facility the same
[2012.32 - 2017.24] structure but you're using the sludge or
[2015.16 - 2019.32] the engine oil or the petroleum
[2017.24 - 2021.84] byproduct and waste and you're growing
[2019.32 - 2023.72] the yeast off of that and that's the
[2021.84 - 2026.92] yeast you're creating and now packaging
[2023.72 - 2029.48] and selling it's been done before they
[2026.92 - 2031.44] do it with baker's yeast they can do it
[2029.48 - 2034.00] with nutritional yeast and there's no
[2031.44 - 2037.32] rules there's no regulations and there's
[2034.00 - 2040.16] no nutritional yeast police police leing
[2037.32 - 2043.64] it and governing it just like there's no
[2040.16 - 2046.12] real marijuana cannabis police that are
[2043.64 - 2048.60] governing if someone sees an apit attack
[2046.12 - 2050.96] on marijuana leaves that they can take a
[2048.60 - 2053.04] can of raid and just shoot it all over
[2050.96 - 2055.44] the place and shoot the plant down to
[2053.04 - 2058.56] kill off those aphids no one's watching
[2055.44 - 2061.04] that either the regulations aren't there
[2058.56 - 2064.36] so what happens when we eat nutritional
[2061.04 - 2065.92] yeast and it's Franken yeast so we're
[2064.36 - 2067.40] chewing it we're eating it we're
[2065.92 - 2070.68] swallowing it
[2067.40 - 2073.84] it's this yeast That Grew off of GMO
[2070.68 - 2076.68] beads it altered its self structure it
[2073.84 - 2079.04] became something different it adapted we
[2076.68 - 2082.72] then consumed it ate it it went down
[2079.04 - 2085.60] into our intestinal tract and now it
[2082.72 - 2088.60] becomes food for something else so this
[2085.60 - 2090.40] will be interesting to know but yeast
[2088.60 - 2095.08] eats
[2090.40 - 2097.40] yeast yeast consumes yeast so now you
[2095.08 - 2099.88] have yeast inside your gut you have
[2097.40 - 2101.80] yeast in your small intestinal tract you
[2099.88 - 2105.00] have yeast in your large intestinal
[2101.80 - 2107.76] tract people have yeast on the rectum
[2105.00 - 2109.76] every day just a big hunk of yeast is
[2107.76 - 2115.64] just right on the edge of the
[2109.76 - 2119.20] rectum yeast devours yeast problem here
[2115.64 - 2121.52] though you have yeast inside of you like
[2119.20 - 2125.28] candida that's going to have to then
[2121.52 - 2128.60] feed off of this yeast the nutritional
[2125.28 - 2131.56] yeast that has died you've consumed it
[2128.60 - 2133.56] you've eaten it and it's not the same
[2131.56 - 2136.00] kind of yeast it's a different yeast but
[2133.56 - 2140.48] it's an altered yeast it's made
[2136.00 - 2144.28] primarily out of GMO food so here you go
[2140.48 - 2148.12] your yeast now is consuming a different
[2144.28 - 2149.04] yeast that has information in it yeast
[2148.12 - 2152.76] is
[2149.04 - 2156.32] intelligent it holds information as it's
[2152.76 - 2157.48] gobbling up the Franken yeast it's
[2156.32 - 2159.72] computing
[2157.48 - 2162.56] it's digesting information it's
[2159.72 - 2165.40] receiving information it can change the
[2162.56 - 2169.12] structure of the yeast that we naturally
[2165.40 - 2171.20] have in us now we have bad yeast in us
[2169.12 - 2173.36] we got good yeast in us we got a
[2171.20 - 2175.40] combination of a few different yeasts
[2173.36 - 2177.80] some people have even more some people
[2175.40 - 2181.48] may have 10 varieties of yeast some
[2177.80 - 2183.60] people may just have two but either way
[2181.48 - 2187.32] it changes the yeast that we naturally
[2183.60 - 2190.68] have in us because as that yeast is
[2187.32 - 2193.04] cleaning up all that dead GMO yeast that
[2190.68 - 2195.76] changed and the cell structure changed
[2193.04 - 2197.64] and everything about it altered for
[2195.76 - 2200.48] survival for
[2197.64 - 2203.40] adaptation as our yeast gobbles up that
[2200.48 - 2206.24] yeast our yeast starts to adapt and
[2203.40 - 2209.60] change and if it's a bad yeast inside of
[2206.24 - 2213.24] us it could adapt and change and create
[2209.60 - 2215.60] infections that won't respond to
[2213.24 - 2217.96] antifungals at the doctor's office or in
[2215.60 - 2219.76] the hospital so now we're in trouble
[2217.96 - 2223.72] there and then if it's a good yeast
[2219.76 - 2226.64] inside of us it can alter and change and
[2223.72 - 2229.24] end up becoming a bad yeast and so the
[2226.64 - 2231.24] good yeast inside of us eats the bad
[2229.24 - 2232.84] yeast and starts to change now what if
[2231.24 - 2236.24] you're somebody that collected a lot of
[2232.84 - 2239.00] yeast in your day public bathrooms
[2236.24 - 2241.56] collecting it there restaurants eating
[2239.00 - 2244.08] out a lot collecting it there
[2241.56 - 2246.48] relationships Partners collecting it
[2244.08 - 2248.84] there hospital visits collecting it
[2246.48 - 2250.56] there there you could be somebody that
[2248.84 - 2253.72] has a lot of different varieties of
[2250.56 - 2255.44] yeast all kinds of yeast and then we're
[2253.72 - 2257.64] putting in that nutritional yeast and
[2255.44 - 2259.12] we're training and teaching all these
[2257.64 - 2262.24] other different yeasts that are inside
[2259.12 - 2264.40] of us to be different and that's where
[2262.24 - 2268.08] things can go wrong that's where chaos
[2264.40 - 2270.16] can ensue it's because our yeast will
[2268.08 - 2272.48] start to learn behavior taking
[2270.16 - 2275.40] information from yeast that isn't
[2272.48 - 2278.08] supposed to even be here on any level
[2275.40 - 2279.72] meanwhile somebody's micro biome doctor
[2278.08 - 2280.92] like who's trying to help somebody with
[2279.72 - 2282.76] the good of their heart and they're
[2280.92 - 2285.36] using all their expertise that they have
[2282.76 - 2287.20] doesn't even know any of this and they
[2285.36 - 2289.68] might even be like hey nutritional yeast
[2287.20 - 2292.04] is fortified and it's got vitamins and
[2289.68 - 2294.32] minerals and oh you can keep that in
[2292.04 - 2296.48] there just make sure you don't do any
[2294.32 - 2299.60] celery juice but make sure you have your
[2296.48 - 2301.80] nutritional yeast there okay so let's go
[2299.60 - 2303.72] to the next big one if you're still into
[2301.80 - 2305.64] your nutritional yeast I don't blame you
[2303.72 - 2307.60] it's hard to let it go and it's
[2305.64 - 2310.24] addictive and we we'll head there don't
[2307.60 - 2312.80] worry but there's one other pink
[2310.24 - 2316.36] elephant in the room and we're gonna
[2312.80 - 2319.08] have to talk about it it's glutamic acid
[2316.36 - 2321.44] whoa I know it I know it I know it I
[2319.08 - 2324.40] know what's happening right now a bunch
[2321.44 - 2325.80] of Ed guys are probably like okay he
[2324.40 - 2328.76] doesn't know anything about this there's
[2325.80 - 2331.84] no MSG in this at all my nutritional
[2328.76 - 2336.08] yeast doesn't have MSG it's welln it's
[2331.84 - 2339.40] not MSG so he'll say glutamic acid he's
[2336.08 - 2343.68] trying to trick us but he's
[2339.40 - 2347.44] wrong all right here it goes glutamic
[2343.68 - 2352.08] acid isn't all plants it's in all
[2347.44 - 2353.48] foods it's an acid that's everywhere so
[2352.08 - 2356.76] why is it a big deal that's in
[2353.48 - 2359.32] nutritional yeast like who hears it's in
[2356.76 - 2362.88] everything because nutritional yeast is
[2359.32 - 2366.64] a yeast that's why we're talking about
[2362.88 - 2370.04] glutamic acid in a yeast we're not
[2366.64 - 2373.68] talking about glutamic acid in an
[2370.04 - 2378.88] asparagus artichoke Brussels sprout
[2373.68 - 2380.88] banana potato green apple berry we're
[2378.88 - 2385.04] not talking about that we're not talking
[2380.88 - 2388.68] about glutamic acid in Dairy yes in eggs
[2385.04 - 2391.24] and meat and chicken even pork that's
[2388.68 - 2393.64] got glutamic acid in it but it's in all
[2391.24 - 2397.48] the different foods but how much is it
[2393.64 - 2401.20] in the different foods for example Le if
[2397.48 - 2405.68] it's in an asparagus a Brussels sprout a
[2401.20 - 2409.16] potato a carrot it's a lot less it's a
[2405.68 - 2414.32] lower amount of glutamic acid another
[2409.16 - 2418.48] thing too fungi is not a plant it's a
[2414.32 - 2423.52] different form of glutamic acid animal
[2418.48 - 2425.96] products most animals are eating plants
[2423.52 - 2429.68] so those animals are eating plants
[2425.96 - 2432.08] they're lamic acid is coming from
[2429.68 - 2433.36] concentrations of the plant Foods
[2432.08 - 2437.32] they're
[2433.36 - 2440.00] consuming but ounce for ounce pound for
[2437.32 - 2443.60] pound it's not a lot of glutamic acid
[2440.00 - 2445.16] compared to yeast and people get carried
[2443.60 - 2446.84] away with their yeast do you know
[2445.16 - 2449.08] anybody who gets carried away with their
[2446.84 - 2452.48] nutritional yeast because I know some
[2449.08 - 2455.76] people they throw it on everything they
[2452.48 - 2458.96] make a lot of food with it there's not a
[2455.76 - 2461.92] lot of glut GLC acid in a carrot not a
[2458.96 - 2465.56] lot of glutamic acid in a cucumber or
[2461.92 - 2468.96] green apple or red apple or a Cherry
[2465.56 - 2471.80] Berry a watermelon but it's highly
[2468.96 - 2474.28] concentrated in yeast highly
[2471.80 - 2478.20] concentrated in nutritional yeast
[2474.28 - 2480.88] because nutritional yeast is a small
[2478.20 - 2483.44] microorganism a small microorganism with
[2480.88 - 2485.80] a lot of glutamic acid within it and
[2483.44 - 2489.08] then we take a large amount of that
[2485.80 - 2492.64] microorg organism we concentrate it it
[2489.08 - 2495.88] becomes a powder it turns out it becomes
[2492.64 - 2499.04] an MSG powder without having to add
[2495.88 - 2501.40] MSG now remember the scientists they're
[2499.04 - 2502.84] not going to do that looky L into things
[2501.40 - 2505.24] they're not going to look at the yeast
[2502.84 - 2507.32] that's feeding off of the GMO beats and
[2505.24 - 2509.48] determine that that yeast is changing
[2507.32 - 2513.32] and adapting they're not going to spend
[2509.48 - 2515.04] the $250 million from a grant to get a
[2513.32 - 2517.20] group of scientists to do that but
[2515.04 - 2519.80] they're also not going to get a grant
[2517.20 - 2521.36] for $250 million to have a bunch of
[2519.80 - 2524.20] scientists look at the different
[2521.36 - 2525.72] glutamic acid structures because they're
[2524.20 - 2528.40] different compounds coming from
[2525.72 - 2531.16] different places so a green apple
[2528.40 - 2533.44] glutamic acid much different than a
[2531.16 - 2535.24] yeast glutamic acid and they're not
[2533.44 - 2537.44] going to take the time to do the lookie
[2535.24 - 2541.16] look to do the looky L to take a look
[2537.44 - 2543.84] and be like whoa wait a minute that
[2541.16 - 2547.76] yeast that produces a different form of
[2543.84 - 2548.84] glutamic acid and it's more concentrated
[2547.76 - 2551.76] and it's
[2548.84 - 2555.32] aggressive because that's what it is a
[2551.76 - 2560.04] yeast glutamic acid is an aggressive
[2555.32 - 2562.52] nature different than a carrot than a
[2560.04 - 2564.64] steak but what they need to do the
[2562.52 - 2568.64] scientists need to isolate the glutamic
[2564.64 - 2571.36] acid from yeast take that isolation take
[2568.64 - 2574.88] that concentration and feed it to mice
[2571.36 - 2577.84] and they can watch the mice and their
[2574.88 - 2581.00] behavior hey did you give the mouse the
[2577.84 - 2584.80] glutamic acid tablet the glutamic acid
[2581.00 - 2588.40] tablet the mouse ate the other Mouse the
[2584.80 - 2591.64] Mouse is dead he ate the other Mouse he
[2588.40 - 2594.68] had an anchor fit and now he wants more
[2591.64 - 2597.96] glutamic acid tablets I went to the cage
[2594.68 - 2601.20] and he ran up to me and he jumped up and
[2597.96 - 2604.12] he want my other glutamic acid
[2601.20 - 2607.16] tablet yeah he killed the other
[2604.12 - 2609.28] Mouse but no one's keeping tabs they're
[2607.16 - 2611.08] not keeping tabs of the GMO beats
[2609.28 - 2612.96] they're feeding the yeast they're not
[2611.08 - 2615.88] keeping tabs of the yeast and how it
[2612.96 - 2617.92] actually evolves they're not keeping
[2615.88 - 2619.64] tabs of the glutamic acid production
[2617.92 - 2623.68] inside the yeast and the fact that the
[2619.64 - 2627.20] glutamic acid production is actually GMO
[2623.68 - 2630.12] it's a glutamic acid that's GMO no one's
[2627.20 - 2632.08] keeping tabs of that and of course
[2630.12 - 2633.76] they're not keeping tabs of the fact
[2632.08 - 2636.08] that the glutamic acid is different than
[2633.76 - 2638.28] any other type of glutamic acid than the
[2636.08 - 2641.76] the type of glutamic acid that's in meat
[2638.28 - 2644.20] beef poultry vegetables fruit to
[2641.76 - 2646.44] different Beast all on its own and no
[2644.20 - 2649.08] one's informing anybody about the
[2646.44 - 2651.60] dosages how much they're consuming how
[2649.08 - 2654.52] much they're eating and is it storing up
[2651.60 - 2658.80] somewhere glutamic acid can store up in
[2654.52 - 2660.60] the brain so wait a minute here we're
[2658.80 - 2663.32] eating all this glutamic acid
[2660.60 - 2666.04] concentrated forms of it in a lot of
[2663.32 - 2667.92] yeast we're putting on our food we're
[2666.04 - 2671.20] assuming large amounts of this gamic
[2667.92 - 2676.00] acid where is it going it goes to the
[2671.20 - 2678.48] brain so all this GMO gamic acid ends up
[2676.00 - 2680.24] inside our brain no one's keeping tabs
[2678.48 - 2682.52] on that either now let's talk about
[2680.24 - 2685.28] dosages I see people they're pouring it
[2682.52 - 2687.24] on they're giving it to their children
[2685.28 - 2689.80] and it's not their fault they're just
[2687.24 - 2692.44] being told it's good for them so that's
[2689.80 - 2694.72] the sad part all on its own people are
[2692.44 - 2696.60] being very generous with the helpings I
[2694.72 - 2698.64] know somebody there like taking a
[2696.60 - 2700.12] scooper and it's a scooper they use and
[2698.64 - 2701.92] they use this big old scooper and it
[2700.12 - 2704.24] just goes in all their food they make
[2701.92 - 2707.40] dishes they make rose you know where
[2704.24 - 2709.72] you're making soups and stews or making
[2707.40 - 2712.32] dressings and ruse people throw it on
[2709.72 - 2714.08] their salads they throw it on their meat
[2712.32 - 2716.40] they throw it on their chicken they
[2714.08 - 2718.16] throw it on all the food they're making
[2716.40 - 2720.12] some people just eat it out of their
[2718.16 - 2722.08] hand they're just popping it in their
[2720.12 - 2724.84] mouth left and right right out of the
[2722.08 - 2726.68] bag they put it on their granola they
[2724.84 - 2728.72] have it on their snacks
[2726.68 - 2729.88] they have it on everything people just
[2728.72 - 2731.64] pop it in their mouth as they're
[2729.88 - 2734.20] coughing and choking on it sometimes
[2731.64 - 2738.16] because you can inhale it by accident
[2734.20 - 2741.44] it's extremely addictive because yeast
[2738.16 - 2744.88] glutamic acid mimics
[2741.44 - 2747.36] MSG it becomes the ultimate comfort food
[2744.88 - 2750.76] for so many people and I don't blame
[2747.36 - 2753.20] them one bit I'm not judging anybody
[2750.76 - 2755.44] okay I know we go through a lot of
[2753.20 - 2757.32] hardships and struggles a lot of stress
[2755.44 - 2760.44] and when we we find a comfort food that
[2757.32 - 2763.88] feels good to us an emotional connection
[2760.44 - 2766.40] happens and we use it as an anchor
[2763.88 - 2769.36] nutritional yeast is a comfort food for
[2766.40 - 2771.60] so many people I feel bad for somebody
[2769.36 - 2773.96] who's listening to this episode when I
[2771.60 - 2776.00] think about it because they may be
[2773.96 - 2779.28] really eating a lot of it and then it's
[2776.00 - 2781.96] about whoa what do I do do I wean myself
[2779.28 - 2785.32] off how do I move this out of my life
[2781.96 - 2787.96] it's really hard the problem with MSG is
[2785.32 - 2790.88] it goes to the brain it gets into the
[2787.96 - 2792.64] nerves it gets on the neurons in the gal
[2790.88 - 2796.44] cells it
[2792.64 - 2799.44] crystallizes MSG deposits build up
[2796.44 - 2801.68] around neurons creating these little
[2799.44 - 2804.00] crystallizations that interfere with
[2801.68 - 2807.44] electrical impulses in our brain
[2804.00 - 2810.24] chemistry creating a brain response
[2807.44 - 2812.08] that's highly addictive I talk more
[2810.24 - 2815.32] about this in the brain saver books
[2812.08 - 2819.04] coming out and then there's gut health
[2815.32 - 2821.76] intes tract Health glutamic acid from
[2819.04 - 2825.00] nutritional yeast aggravates nerve
[2821.76 - 2826.72] endings in the intestinal tract lining
[2825.00 - 2829.36] if someone's got gas and bloating
[2826.72 - 2832.84] Crohn's colitis or Celiac or some kind
[2829.36 - 2835.08] of distension some kind of cramping
[2832.84 - 2837.88] maybe flatulence maybe gastroparesis
[2835.08 - 2840.64] maybe some type of intestinal tract
[2837.88 - 2844.00] disorder nutritional yeast is the last
[2840.64 - 2847.44] thing you want to eat it's an intestinal
[2844.00 - 2850.28] irritant a colon irritant it's
[2847.44 - 2852.80] problematic inside the intestinal tract
[2850.28 - 2855.92] causes a lot of problems with the lining
[2852.80 - 2858.08] a lot of food sensitivity doctors food
[2855.92 - 2859.80] allergists they'll test you for a lot of
[2858.08 - 2861.64] different allergies they'll have a big
[2859.80 - 2864.16] old list of your food
[2861.64 - 2867.24] sensitivities and most of the time if
[2864.16 - 2870.12] not all the time nutritional yeast won't
[2867.24 - 2871.80] be on the list and you'll be free to eat
[2870.12 - 2875.40] all the nutritional yeast You Ever
[2871.80 - 2878.88] Wanted by your doctor's orders Katie the
[2875.40 - 2881.72] doctor will see you well Katie it looks
[2878.88 - 2884.40] like your food allergist has came in and
[2881.72 - 2887.96] it doesn't seem like you have a food
[2884.40 - 2887.96] allergy a food
[2889.00 - 2894.08] allergy a food allergy to nutritional
[2891.88 - 2899.24] yeast after
[2894.08 - 2903.08] all it saddens me so many good people
[2899.24 - 2907.16] doing good things for themselves wanting
[2903.08 - 2910.20] the best out of life wanting to heal
[2907.16 - 2915.04] wanting to make sure that everything
[2910.20 - 2917.44] they do is right it matters to them life
[2915.04 - 2919.76] matters health is
[2917.44 - 2923.36] everything they care about their loved
[2919.76 - 2926.68] ones they care about their friends the
[2923.36 - 2929.08] people they know they want what's best
[2926.68 - 2934.40] for everybody around them and they want
[2929.08 - 2936.36] to learn and they want to grow but then
[2934.40 - 2940.76] comes Darkness
[2936.36 - 2944.60] you just can't see blinders on and we
[2940.76 - 2948.92] don't understand how capable Darkness
[2944.60 - 2951.96] can be and we don't see behind the
[2948.92 - 2954.68] mirror as we're looking at ourselves
[2951.96 - 2957.60] that there are obstacles in the way of
[2954.68 - 2961.04] our healing that have taken us and our
[2957.60 - 2965.00] health but once we learn and find our
[2961.04 - 2967.88] way we strengthen and never let anything
[2965.00 - 2970.84] ever again again get in our way
[2967.88 - 2974.76] knowledge is power and power of the
[2970.84 - 2978.68] light so bright it kills the yeast that
[2974.76 - 2981.80] grows as it fights and how do we trust
[2978.68 - 2985.24] to find our way there's so much out
[2981.80 - 2988.44] there we don't know that contributes and
[2985.24 - 2990.88] it makes our body pay we want to feel
[2988.44 - 2994.52] better than less than we want to feel
[2990.88 - 2997.00] our best we don't want to be sad we
[2994.52 - 3000.60] don't want to be left out we want to
[2997.00 - 3003.56] know all of the rest when we think about
[3000.60 - 3006.08] it we get tricked into putting things
[3003.56 - 3009.68] into our mouth by telling us it's
[3006.08 - 3013.04] healthy and it will provide a way out
[3009.68 - 3016.40] but not all the things we eat are really
[3013.04 - 3020.00] good for us and not all foods are the
[3016.40 - 3022.72] same and are really safe for us when you
[3020.00 - 3027.44] have the truth in your hands you got the
[3022.72 - 3027.44] freedom to choose
