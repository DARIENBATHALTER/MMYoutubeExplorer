doctor visits all the time and you're

46
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,320
doing all that and you know it takes

47
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:47,909
them it really takes the toll on people

48
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,799
when you're running around in your whole

49
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:51,780
life is about visiting doctors or

50
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:53,579
visiting nutritionists doctors

51
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:54,840
dieticians and then you think this and

52
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:57,119
this and then you're on the internet and

53
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,649
you're looking for something else and so

54
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,659
you guys are here because hey we're

55
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:03,030
trying to make sure you have the answers

56
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:04,500
that you know that this is powerful

57
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:06,240
information that works and that's what

58
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,649
it's about I mean it's about the mission

59
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,270
of getting medical medium information

60
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:12,390
out there and I can't believe I got you

61
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:13,190
here again yeah you know there is

62
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:15,290
something that

63
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:17,870
that we were talking about before which

64
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:20,090
is if I'm not mentioning something if

65
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm not talking about a product like

66
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:26,360
Moringa powder collagen or something

67
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,240
else if I'm not behind something I'm not

68
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:33,500
behind beets you know what I mean don't

69
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:34,940
you louder exactly if I'm not behind

70
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:37,100
something like that meringue that's not

71
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:39,800
go G berries if I'm not behind something

72
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:42,290
that means you don't need to have it in

73
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:44,690
your regimen because it's not gonna make

74
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:46,760
or break your movement forward with like

75
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:49,070
a real problem with like real sickness

76
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:50,120
real health issues the whole bit I mean

77
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:52,010
you hear about it all the time right

78
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:54,560
people always like what about this right

79
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:56,720
absolutely so let's let's take beets for

80
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,670
example yeah so a lot of people ask me

81
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,350
about beets and I had just on my own

82
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:02,030
notice through all of the books that

83
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:03,680
that I had read in the healing foods

84
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:06,110
book he never says anything about bees

85
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,180
and one time I it might have been on

86
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:10,490
your podcast or an Instagram live or

87
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:12,740
something one time I heard him say beets

88
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:14,060
and you don't need to you know use beets

89
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:15,950
you don't need to like go out of your

90
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:17,840
way to have some beets and I remember

91
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:19,850
that lodging in my brain I'm thinking

92
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,740
okay well I don't know why but I'm just

93
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:23,480
not going to bother and I like beets but

94
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:25,670
there are so many other foods to be

95
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:27,620
eating that are healing foods that are

96
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:29,570
gonna help you process or pull out your

97
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:32,240
heavy-metal detox you know all your

98
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:34,070
heavy metals and so why not focus on

99
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,780
those so what is it with beets what's

100
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:38,180
your count of the beets man well beets

101
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:39,980
is like God what about their growing you

102
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:41,570
know what's your problem I know I know

103
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:43,040
you can eat them you could totally them

104
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:44,959
to find I mean you can do that they're

105
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,250
fine they're not gonna hurt you you know

106
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,930
there's no okay beets out there

107
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:49,610
obviously there's heirloom beets out

108
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:52,820
there but one of the things is that the

109
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:54,800
GMO beets have really cross pollinated

110
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:57,170
okay so like people were worried about

111
00:03:54,800 --> 00:04:00,290
GMO well you get these crops were there

112
00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:02,900
GMO beets now justice fields and fields

113
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:06,260
and fields of GMO B and so what happens

114
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:08,150
is pollination time boom cross pollinate

115
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:10,489
then the other beets and other fields

116
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:13,190
get affected so beets essentially are

117
00:04:10,489 --> 00:04:15,770
not really GMO free it's but it's

118
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:17,030
impossible got to have a GMO for it it's

119
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:19,609
just impossible that's number one number

120
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:21,739
two is it's a filler it's a great way to

121
00:04:19,609 --> 00:04:24,020
make money in supplement world for years

122
00:04:21,739 --> 00:04:24,830
the whole beet thing mm-hmm it's a great

123
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:26,599
way to make money

124
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:28,430
it's a great way to be like yeah this is

125
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:29,930
gonna be good free than you put it in

126
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:31,879
supplements you'll see it in all these

127
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:34,009
different supplement blends where it's

128
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:35,300
like you know you got this in here this

129
00:04:34,009 --> 00:04:36,800
in here this here you got a little bit

130
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:38,960
of this this this this like 50

131
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,220
ingredients and one of those powders you

132
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,289
know you got the powders and you'll see

133
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:43,849
beet powder in their spinach powder this

134
00:04:42,289 --> 00:04:46,250
powder carrot powder and it goes all the

135
00:04:43,849 --> 00:04:48,409
way down which really is just a little

136
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:49,940
speck of this in a speck of that and it

137
00:04:48,409 --> 00:04:51,860
just rips people off and then you pay

138
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:53,479
like 100 bucks for a big protein powder

139
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:56,270
thing or fifty bucks for a protein

140
00:04:53,479 --> 00:04:58,340
powder thing or whatever a juice powder

141
00:04:56,270 --> 00:05:00,020
or whatever that might be and so beet

142
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:01,520
greens would be the same thing because

143
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:04,009
it's all the whole thing is GMO without

144
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,530
corn it's the same thing the beet green

145
00:05:04,009 --> 00:05:08,900
is actually healthier for you okay then

146
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:10,759
the beet but it still got the GMO

147
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:12,050
tendency your possibility that's why I

148
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:14,060
always tell people you know you don't

149
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:15,740
really have to have beets and it was a

150
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:18,050
filler in the juice world back in the

151
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:19,729
old days you juice you juice your carrot

152
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:22,250
to juice your beets you make it nice and

153
00:05:19,729 --> 00:05:24,680
sweet you put a little spinach in there

154
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:26,870
was always a filler it was always look

155
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:29,960
does it have healing benefits sure it's

156
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:32,210
a healthy root vegetable it is a healthy

157
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:34,550
root vegetable it's true what is it is

158
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:36,889
it a game-changer no does it clean the

159
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:39,199
liver like wild blueberries no that's

160
00:05:36,889 --> 00:05:41,270
the whole point how do you get better if

161
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,889
you're getting information everywhere

162
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:44,539
else so then all of a sudden someone's

163
00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:46,400
not doing their frozen wild blueberries

164
00:05:44,539 --> 00:05:48,440
anymore and now the brain worried about

165
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,419
beets and beet powder and beat this and

166
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,889
eat that it's always a confusion now

167
00:05:50,419 --> 00:05:54,020
they're bringing in their collagen now

168
00:05:51,889 --> 00:05:55,639
they what about the Moringa powder doing

169
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,199
they're doing all the stuff and then

170
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:58,759
they lose track and then they get

171
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,440
another doctor telling them oh you got

172
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:02,300
your microbiome off another doctor

173
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:04,400
telling oh you've got Candida oh you got

174
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:06,800
this you got that and then what happens

175
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,180
is you're lost and five years go by and

176
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,129
then you still got your Hashimoto's

177
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:11,810
coming on and nobody realizes that you

178
00:06:10,129 --> 00:06:13,370
still got your autoimmune diagnosis

179
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:14,779
coming you still got all these other

180
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:16,430
things because the Medical mean

181
00:06:14,779 --> 00:06:18,349
information is about the truth about

182
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:20,240
what you really need and you have to

183
00:06:18,349 --> 00:06:21,680
adhere to it and you have to keep to it

184
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,330
so you can really stay on track

185
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,310
absolutely and you find that people end

186
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:27,409
up saying what the the medical medium

187
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:29,270
stuff didn't work for me but if you're

188
00:06:27,409 --> 00:06:31,610
combining it with five other people's

189
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:33,740
ideas or philosophies yeah that's not

190
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:34,780
fair really to any of the philosophies

191
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:36,970
you have to

192
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:39,070
you have to jump in well normally that

193
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:40,990
mixing yeah they're always mixing right

194
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:43,030
and that's a human nature because you

195
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:45,070
know a and P if people are in trouble

196
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:46,810
and they're sick they want yes they want

197
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:48,400
to get well right away and it's hard to

198
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:49,930
be patient and I understand people's

199
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,510
frustration if it's their skin or

200
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:54,520
whatever's going on and they want may

201
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:56,020
want results but that's where you have

202
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:57,640
to trust you have to look at some of the

203
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:59,560
posts on your Instagram and stuff of

204
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:01,960
people the changes and listen to their

205
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:03,820
stories and understand that there's

206
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:05,920
nobody writing that I did this in a day

207
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:08,230
later I was cured they commit to

208
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:09,760
something it takes time and patience and

209
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:11,470
you have to be have to be kind to

210
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:13,630
yourself and your process because it

211
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:15,370
just it's not like taking you know

212
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:17,080
medication it doesn't change overnight

213
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:19,690
it takes time and everybody's different

214
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:21,490
I see a lot of comments I looked at the

215
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:23,230
comments from our last live and also

216
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:25,480
whenever I'm watching Instagram or the

217
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:27,490
Facebook stuff and there's a lot of

218
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,810
comments in the community and that's one

219
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:31,570
of the things that I wanted to say was

220
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:34,090
there's so much information in a the

221
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:36,760
books be the podcasts to see the

222
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:38,830
Instagram live posts all everything at

223
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:40,780
all of the medical medium information

224
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:42,970
that is gettable there's so much

225
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:44,560
information there and in the community

226
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:45,940
because the qalaat of the community has

227
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,280
been through a lot and they know and

228
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:50,500
they'll put things on comments and

229
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:52,720
answer questions so that keep keep aware

230
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:55,300
of that and keep watching that but also

231
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:58,390
all of the all of the questions that I

232
00:07:55,300 --> 00:08:00,250
saw from last time and in all of the

233
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:02,260
years I've been you know following what

234
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:06,040
Anthony and medical medium says they're

235
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:07,990
all in the books they truly are so I get

236
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:09,640
it some people aren't readers I would

237
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:10,990
suggest maybe getting the audiobook

238
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:13,000
because they aren't their audience so

239
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:14,830
you could get them on audio and listen

240
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,350
in the car if you're driving or you know

241
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:19,030
on the subway or whatever cuz really the

242
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:21,310
answers are in the book it's not as

243
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:23,110
direct as like Anthony what's the answer

244
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:24,700
to this like getting the opportunity to

245
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:26,170
speak to him directly but I didn't even

246
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:27,850
do that I'm his friend and I don't call

247
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:29,740
him with all the questions that I have

248
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:31,810
or one of my friends had it it's tough

249
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:33,340
cause yeah I don't want to bother him I

250
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:35,200
respect and honor his well you guys

251
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:36,490
stopped calling yeah you guys stopped

252
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,770
calling you're like let's leave him

253
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:40,510
alone he's no he's got too much going on

254
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:43,690
he's got he's got so much going on but

255
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:44,740
seriously the answers are all in the in

256
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:46,750
front of all the medical medium

257
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:48,220
information it is there you you have to

258
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:50,230
read and you have to listen and you have

259
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:52,959
to go through it and you have to put it

260
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:55,089
all together and it you'll find your

261
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:56,830
answers there's a lot of sand traps out

262
00:08:55,089 --> 00:08:58,510
there set for the people there's a lot

263
00:08:56,830 --> 00:09:00,910
of potholes there's a lot of sand traps

264
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:02,649
and they're set purposely they want to

265
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:04,630
keep your brain washed about protein

266
00:09:02,649 --> 00:09:06,760
whether you're vegan or your or your

267
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:08,560
animal protein diet or keto diet

268
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:11,050
high-fat diet they want to keep you all

269
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:13,149
we still set on protein being law

270
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:15,010
somewhere in one of your diets it

271
00:09:13,149 --> 00:09:17,080
doesn't matter because meanwhile

272
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:19,209
everybody has enough protein has been

273
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:20,740
getting enough protein has always got

274
00:09:19,209 --> 00:09:23,260
enough protein but it doesn't stop

275
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:24,880
chronic illness and the keto diet I know

276
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:26,860
they talk about how it's just a high fat

277
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,209
diet high fat diet but anybody I've

278
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:29,440
talked to doing the keto diet they're

279
00:09:28,209 --> 00:09:31,089
still worried about how much protein

280
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,899
they're eating they're still worried

281
00:09:31,089 --> 00:09:33,550
about where they're getting their

282
00:09:31,899 --> 00:09:35,110
protein because no matter what it's

283
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:36,640
always about protein so you got

284
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:38,320
everything you know protein warning

285
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,690
shakes protein this protein not what

286
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,399
happens is that's a sand trap setting

287
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:44,500
the stage so you never have answers to

288
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,820
what causes chronic illness and so say

289
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,290
you're in good you say you're in good

290
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:48,730
health right now and you're just focused

291
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:50,860
on protein sure but when you start

292
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:52,120
getting sick later then then you're

293
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:53,410
third you're still going to be focused

294
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:55,480
on protein meanwhile you've been getting

295
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:58,120
enough protein everybody yeah you can't

296
00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:00,700
not get enough protein no matter what at

297
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:02,589
all times it's not it's not you know

298
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:04,089
it's always been like that and I'm going

299
00:10:02,589 --> 00:10:06,339
to talk about fats a little bit too

300
00:10:04,089 --> 00:10:08,110
because when you're doing high fats

301
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:10,270
where that gets you in trouble so here

302
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:12,730
there's so many traps you got the high

303
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:14,649
fat trap that just bogs down your liver

304
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:16,870
and pancreas sex your sets the stage for

305
00:10:14,649 --> 00:10:18,850
sickness later on - even if it's healthy

306
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:20,620
high fat diets then you get the pie

307
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:22,570
protein where it's all about protein no

308
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:24,940
matter what you see so these traps

309
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:26,500
receptors yeah and the hydrating I mean

310
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:28,120
the animal protein has so much fat in it

311
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:30,279
now the problem with these include

312
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:31,839
exactly I mean it's fine if you I guess

313
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:33,970
we want to have animal protein but

314
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,829
you're automatically having fat when you

315
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:36,940
have the animal for exactly and if you

316
00:10:35,829 --> 00:10:38,200
want to go claim pee so you guys are

317
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:40,630
plant-based but you don't innovate

318
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:42,160
yourselves with fats 24/7 and that's

319
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:43,480
what they're doing so you got two

320
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,100
plant-based people so many of you guys

321
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:47,740
are and you're bringing in the facts all

322
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:50,199
the time and so it's all about always

323
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:51,120
setting potholes there's reasons for

324
00:10:50,199 --> 00:10:52,650
this that you don't

325
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,200
so you don't move forward there's a

326
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:57,240
reason for why that's happening the

327
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,190
industry's all of them including the

328
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:02,070
other alternative industries are set up

329
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:04,080
so you fail somewhere down the line one

330
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:05,910
way or another and that's the difference

331
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,440
between the macro medium information and

332
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:08,730
making sure people have a chance because

333
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,650
I want people to have a fighting chance

334
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:12,000
because sure when you don't have much

335
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:13,890
going on and you have a little bit of

336
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,290
acne and you got a few symptoms and your

337
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:17,940
digestive tracts a little off and you're

338
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:19,500
yelling you're young it's just who cares

339
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:21,270
right you just try this you're doing

340
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,040
this you're trying to do this but man

341
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:24,810
when you start it you're now in your 30s

342
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,550
now in your 40s you get diagnosed with

343
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:28,650
autoimmune or something else and then

344
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:31,200
you'll feel fine just sinking ship fast

345
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:33,990
between the high protein or the high fat

346
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:36,240
or the collagen you'll find that that

347
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:38,820
ship sinks it starts to sink and people

348
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,339
start learning whoa until they know what

349
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:43,740
it's like to go on the path of doctor to

350
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:46,320
doctor to doctor looking for answers

351
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:48,120
trying to find you all of it is when you

352
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,620
know it breaks my heart it breaks my

353
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:51,270
heart I've been watching this for so

354
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:53,040
long I have a specific question about

355
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:55,080
this so one of the questions was

356
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,880
heavy-metal detox smoothie which we do

357
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:59,670
every day or I do the liver rescue

358
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:01,709
smoothie and I have generally I always

359
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:03,600
do water but a lot of times I'll do cook

360
00:12:01,709 --> 00:12:05,850
will do coconut water in the heavy metal

361
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,970
toxicity is that okay because I know

362
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:11,040
you're late I know coconut meat has fat

363

it's not easy and you know we've been at

502
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:54,460
it you know if even when you start to a

503
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:56,320
simple you know achievable it's like the

504
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:58,690
pikelet Kloster that's another thing but

making sixteen ounces at least of celery

512
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:17,160

else and that's all you can do that's

514
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:20,160
fantastic

515
00:17:22,089 --> 00:17:27,669
yes so is it is there a specific amount

516
00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:30,039
of lemons I mean I used to do two in 16

517
00:17:27,669 --> 00:17:32,470
ounces now I do one I mean is there a

518
00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:33,850
specific amount and also when how soon

519
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:35,350
should you hydrate when you get up in

520
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:37,809
the morning I mean I do it pretty much

521
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:39,159
right away yeah is is there because your

522
00:17:37,809 --> 00:17:40,870
the body needs to hydrate as soon as you

523
00:17:39,159 --> 00:17:43,110

dehydrated if you have anything

527
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:51,520
neurological going on it's really a cool

528
00:17:49,029 --> 00:17:53,110
point right there this is so critical if

529
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,330
you have aches and pains that are kind

530
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:56,770
of unexplainable if you've got tangles

531
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:59,110
and numbness ringing in the ears

532
00:17:56,770 --> 00:18:01,090
dizziness balance issues any vertigo in

533
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:03,580
the past if you have focus and

534
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:05,590

00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:15,100
mentioned that that are neurological

540
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:17,049
tics spasms and so forth maybe I did

541
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:18,610

542
00:18:17,049 --> 00:18:20,740
anything like that maybe you've been

543
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:22,480
diagnosed with neurological Lyme maybe

544
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:24,159
you have a diagnosis that involves the

545
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,990
nervous system and you don't know it and

546
00:18:24,159 --> 00:18:27,880
it's all based around central nervous so

547
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:30,010
the whole point is we wake up in the

548
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:33,220
morning dehydrated and our nervous

549
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:35,620
system is is desperate for like a lemon

550
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:37,630
water desperate for something like that

551
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:40,480
lecture lights and everything else and

552
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:43,000
it's so important we all night long your

553
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:45,549
liver is packing up the garbage is what

554
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:48,070
it's doing and if you had a really high

555
00:18:45,549 --> 00:18:50,529
fat dinner at night then it's really

556
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:52,690
packaged working hard it's over labored

557
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:54,039
it's trying to cleanse but there's the

558
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:55,360
fats are in the bloodstream that's

559
00:18:54,039 --> 00:18:57,700
really hard for the liver when we have

560
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:59,679
really high fat dinners so here we are

561
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:01,659
you know the whole high fat movement is

562
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:04,510
supposed to be so good for you but man

563
00:19:01,659 --> 00:19:05,710
when you have a high fat dinner and okay

564
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:07,299
maybe someone's like well what does that

565
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:08,980
mean how fat dinner you know what I'm

566
00:19:07,299 --> 00:19:10,720
saying if you're putting oil on

567
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:12,490
something and on your dinner if you're

568
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,679
if you're doing too many nut butters at

569
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:16,600
night if you're doing if you're doing

570
00:19:14,679 --> 00:19:18,580
two avocados at night if you're doing

571
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:20,409
you know oil on on your food whether

572
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:23,350
it's vegan or some other different meal

573
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:25,000
or whatever eat whatever it is and maybe

574
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:27,789
you're doing CMM you're doing animal

575
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,770
proteins at 92 plus oil on your salad

576
00:19:27,789 --> 00:19:32,330
you're just doing it's just too much fat

577
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:34,789
right there your bloodstream but yeah

578
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:36,950
but err exactly whatever it could be you

579
00:19:34,789 --> 00:19:38,870
got and then and then all night long

580
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:41,330
your blood fat is really high you have

581
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:43,700
less oxygen to your brain less oxygen to

582
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:46,070
your organs any kind of illness can

583
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:49,190
actually move forward and getting worse

584
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:50,659
over time versus getting better because

585
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:52,700
the fats are too high it's not like you

586
00:19:50,659 --> 00:19:54,470
had a half an avocado it's not like you

587
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:56,269
had you might have had nut butters that

588
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:57,769
day if your plant-based but that should

589
00:19:56,269 --> 00:19:59,600
be about it if you had nut butters that

590
00:19:57,769 --> 00:20:02,390
day maybe dinner time shouldn't be so

591
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:04,340
high in that and so it's it's in that

592
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:06,769
kind of you know on that kind of level

593
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:08,690
so all night long your liver struggling

594
00:20:06,769 --> 00:20:10,990
it's indicated with fat it goes up the

595
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:13,850
paddock portal highway into the liver it

596
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:15,889
soaks into there so your livers battling

597
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:17,360
to take out the garbage to detoxify by

598
00:20:15,889 --> 00:20:19,789
morning time you're extra hot

599
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:22,880
dehydrating because fats the hydrate us

600
00:20:19,789 --> 00:20:25,039
so we're extra dehydrated and so by

601
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:27,590
morning time if you don't get that lemon

602
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:30,620
water you know that flush in the morning

603
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:32,690
not hydration and flush you can be it

604
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:34,760
compiles it then the new livers backed

605
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:36,799
up another day another week in your life

606
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:38,360
then another month in your life because

607
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:41,000
your liver can even though it's still

608
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:43,370
working it can back up weeks and weeks

609
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,010
and in years and then become diseased

610
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:49,760
like stagnant sluggish fatty liver

611
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:51,440
diabetes type 2 diabetes anything like

612
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,510
they get the hot flashes you get the

613
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,519
weight gain and the weight gain comes on

614
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:57,679
and all that because your liver is just

615
00:20:55,519 --> 00:20:59,450
too stagnant and sluggish over time and

616
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:04,429
they work we can be dehydrated for

617
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:07,519
decades where's my lemon water well and

618
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:10,279
I'm sorry Kiwi I remember you saying and

619
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:12,019
the dehydration gets us off yeah yeah

620
00:21:10,279 --> 00:21:13,909
okay so go ahead no I just saw her so

621
00:21:12,019 --> 00:21:16,250
then the lemon water will take that

622
00:21:13,909 --> 00:21:17,929
liver and give that liver flushes in our

623
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:19,250
yeah it helps it flush in the morning

624
00:21:17,929 --> 00:21:21,470
that's the thing it flushes out

625
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:23,299
delivering nobody knew that nobody knew

626
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:25,639
that that's medical medium information I

627
00:21:23,299 --> 00:21:28,850
mean people put squeezing lemon in water

628
00:21:25,639 --> 00:21:29,720
for centuries okay centuries that's what

629
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:31,190
they've been doing they've been

630
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:34,159
squeezing lemon in water that's that's

631
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:36,409
been around long before me but as far as

632
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:38,059
it's flushing out the liver as far as it

633
00:21:36,409 --> 00:21:39,950
flushing out toxins out of the body

634
00:21:38,059 --> 00:21:42,230
that's a medical medium information now

635
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:44,360
it's become law out there meaning it's

636
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:46,549
out there and after people know

637
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:50,570
that information region eights from my

638
00:21:46,549 --> 00:21:52,370
source that's the whole point and so you

639
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:54,920
know look the whole the whole point is

640
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:56,660
and I've actually talked about that on

641
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:58,490
the years about the lemon water doing

642
00:21:56,660 --> 00:22:00,890
this through lectures in the past right

643
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:02,600
many years ago this isn't just three

644
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:04,940
years ago five years ago is doing

645
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:07,100
lectures thirty years ago in places I

646
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:10,040
mean I was on the bottom of churches I

647
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:11,690
was in church basements I doing last

648
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:13,580
year's four to three hundred people at a

649
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:15,110
clip then going to the next church to

650
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:17,000
three hundred people at a clip the next

651
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:20,030
church at war health food store or

652
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,980
whatever back in the old days teaching

653
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:24,200
people about these various things about

654
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:26,630
all of it including avocados are good

655
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:28,100
for you teaching people that avocados

656
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:29,660
are good for you yeah okay

657
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:31,370
meaning you don't want to over eat them

658
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:33,500
but they're good for you yeah that

659
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:35,690
people thought avocados were poison back

660
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:37,760
thirty years ago doctors wouldn't let

661
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:39,590
you eat them people people they know in

662
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:42,140
the health movement you can find one in

663
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:44,450
the health food store okay and and

664
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:47,210
literally I went from state to state

665
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:48,890
over the decades teaching people you can

666
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:50,780
eat this at Mikado it's actually good

667
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:53,000
for you now everybody's over here and so

668
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:54,799
now I'm actually doing the opposite slow

669
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,750
down I mean out of the two hundred and

670
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:58,730
fifty thousand individuals I helped out

671
00:22:56,750 --> 00:23:00,440
in the last thirty five years one on one

672
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:03,380
not even the lectures and other things I

673
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:05,330
taught them about the lemon water so

674
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:07,850
when someone says he didn't delete it

675
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:09,740
knows what lemon water he didn't he

676
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:11,570
wasn't the guy that's know about

677
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:13,340
flushing out the liver flushing out the

678
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:15,410
toxins and hydrating you first thing in

679
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:17,840
the morning not originated from a mean

680
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:19,490
and it does help and it's critical so if

681
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,679
you're doing that in the morning it

682
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:22,100
makes a huge impact on how does it

683
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:24,440
matter

684
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:25,850
yeah two lemons oh it doesn't matter one

685
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:27,950
lemon two lemon there's eight ounces

686
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:29,390
sixteen ounces I mean more that's a

687
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:30,980
really good point you know some people

688
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:32,960
they don't like the lemon it's sharp

689
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:35,419
they don't like the hit by and you know

690
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:37,700
they feel kind of like it's too intense

691
00:23:35,419 --> 00:23:40,190
they can do a half a lemon in sixteen

692
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:42,110
ounces if they really want that's fine I

693
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:44,809
like a whole lemon in sixteen ounces

694
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:47,419
what I do yeah in some limits are much

695
00:23:44,809 --> 00:23:49,340
more juicier yeah so you just got this

696
00:23:47,419 --> 00:23:51,860
game going on and then you wait how long

697
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:54,110
before the celery juice yeah yeah half

698
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:56,000
an hour's past 20 minutes you could do

699
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:56,720
probably and the question I get all the

700
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,950
time is why

701
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:03,580
sixteen ounces of celery juice in the

702
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:08,210
celery book I know it's in the celery

703
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:10,730
right now in the book but I just was in

704
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:12,950
the book yes but we're not gonna tell ya

705
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:14,240
no no yeah we're gonna let him tell ya

706
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:17,000
it's people asked all the time yeah I

707
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:19,820
want the short cut what yeah yes okay so

708
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,710
yeah 16 ounces because you need the

709
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:25,010
travel time it has so many obstacles

710
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:27,230
that celery juice has so many problems

711
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:30,010
meaning it's gonna run into because

712
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:32,659
everybody's a mess they're a mess inside

713
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:34,280
everybody is a disaster inside meaning

714
00:24:32,659 --> 00:24:35,750
you know and that's what happens so you

715
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,260
said whatever you know basically what

716
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:38,539
that means

717
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:40,159
you got you got streptococcus e.coli

718
00:24:38,539 --> 00:24:42,559
people got all kinds of different levels

719
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:44,570
of bacteria they could viruses in their

720
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:45,710
system in their livers they got bacteria

721
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:47,870
in their intestinal tract lymphatic

722
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:49,159
system they have that to begin with you

723
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:51,559
know that's just to start with they have

724
00:24:49,159 --> 00:24:56,150
putrified and you guys everybody has

725
00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:58,429
this putrified fats that are lined up on

726
00:24:56,150 --> 00:25:02,390
the intestinal walls just sitting there

727
00:24:58,429 --> 00:25:04,700
and what's behind it is is bacteria okay

728
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:06,740
and that is why this has nothing to do

729
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:08,299
with microbiome crap that you hear out

730
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:10,100
there like the new like that's just a

731
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:12,350
new talk because Candida is dying out

732
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:14,750
that whole fad and shrank basically I

733
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:16,370
knocked out the Candida trend back yeah

734
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:18,799
the first publication of medical media

735
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:21,080
but I hurt that trend so bad good

736
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:23,390
because because it was completely

737
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:25,760
misguided right because Candida without

738
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:27,980
Candida we died right so the whole thing

739
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,840
about Candida being died for you and and

740
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:31,580
and how do you have to get rid of all of

741
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,320
it we stopped that the medical medium

742
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:34,669
information so then they had to move

743
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:36,740
into something else they had to move

744
00:25:34,669 --> 00:25:38,539
into the SIBO they had to move into

745
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:40,549
their microbiome and now I got to

746
00:25:38,539 --> 00:25:43,580
actually work on that now where that's

747
00:25:40,549 --> 00:25:45,980
not it either because what it is is we

748
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:47,780
have purified protein and fat lining on

749
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:50,299
the intestinal lining is just on the

750
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:52,970
walls of the gut right and that's the

751
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:56,480
problem with with Lobel reserves in the

752
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:58,070
liver weak livers low hydrochloric acid

753
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,620
in their stomach and that's where the

754
00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:02,870
real main problem is so then bacteria

755
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:05,210
harbors behind this fat lining that's in

756
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:07,250
the intestinal in intestinal walls and

757
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:09,800
and behind that protein fat that's

758
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:11,900
actually been it's rancid and it's cake

759
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:13,910
on all the way down which is why when

760
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:14,900
people have this this feeling of like

761
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:16,400
they have to go to the bathroom right

762
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:17,750
away when they and they drink it and a

763
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,110
lot of people have that I had it for two

764
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:19,790
years

765
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:21,380
yeah so learn to use I dream my celery

766
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:23,240
juicers went to the bathroom and then it

767
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:26,090
stopped because that 16 ounces is

768
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:28,280
working on dissolving that lining it's

769
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:30,140
dissolving the sodium cluster salt said

770
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:33,350
science research has no idea about is

771
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:35,960
actually dissolving the fats the rancid

772
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:37,970
fats and rancid proteins on the walls of

773
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:40,070
the intestinal tract and starting to

774
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:41,960
break it away and your body wants to rid

775
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:43,580
that poison so it's just like yeah I got

776
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:45,470
to rid this poison I got rid of it and

777
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:47,570
get it out so it's trying to push it out

778
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:49,250
fast some people are so toxic you guys

779
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:51,350
know you probably know somebody some

780
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:53,210
people are so toxic where they haven't

781
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:55,040
hit something it's like whoa yeah and

782
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:56,930
and so yeah and if you're and if you're

783
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:59,210
not you know if you could do more

784
00:26:56,930 --> 00:27:01,130
sellers you should do more and you if

785
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:02,960
you can handle it you do more you do 32

786
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:04,700
ounces or whatever but that's how it

787
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,290
works but just stick with it if that's

788
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:07,940
the effect on you and you're like I

789
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:09,440
can't do this because I have to run to

790
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:11,210
the bathroom right away get up a little

791
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,740
bit earlier you have your celery juice

792
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:14,390
being home so you can run to the

793
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:17,030
bathroom when you need to because

794
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:19,370
literally I had that for two years and

795
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:21,410
after about two years year and a half it

796
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:22,790
started changing and now I don't have it

797
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:24,800
anymore and all I can assume is that

798
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:26,750
most of that sludge that was packed on

799
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:28,490
the sides of the intestine have has gone

800
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:30,860
away and now everything is normal in

801
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:32,480
terms of I get up you know well then

802
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:33,830
then the sodium plus the salts of the

803
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,630
celery juice can kill off the

804
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:37,790
streptococcus and people say well I

805
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:39,200
don't have strep well did you have strep

806
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:41,480
throat when you were a kid because it's

807
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,980
day menu it's still there yeah and it

808
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:46,130
causes acne later

809
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:49,730
it causes UTIs bladder infections

810
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:52,430
interstitial cystitis right it causes

811
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:55,280
you know overactive bladder kidney

812
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:56,930
infections it causes yeast infections so

813
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:59,180
when people get the yeast infection

814
00:27:56,930 --> 00:28:00,830
diagnosis that's streptococcus behind

815
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:04,100
that interes that's what that is

816
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:06,320
so yeah people don't know that there's

817
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:09,110
so much work so when you says the celery

818
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:11,060
juice has so many obstacles there's you

819
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:12,800
need 16 ounces because there's a lot to

820
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:14,450
do there's a lot to do right there's a

821
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,980
lot to break down and each person

822
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:17,600
there's a lot of poison to move out of

823
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:19,070
the liver there's a lot of poison to

824
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,740
move out that you test the line you ever

825
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:21,390
dissolve that

826
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:23,880
that and that old protein that's been

827
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:25,710
caked on and then then you got

828
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:27,300
everybody's pharmaceuticals inside their

829
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:29,100
liver they've got things inside their

830
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:31,020
liver then you got to push all that down

831
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:33,929
old pharmaceuticals you guys ever taken

832
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:35,580
antibiotic well you need 16 ounces or

833
00:28:33,929 --> 00:28:37,830
more soda juice because you got to flush

834
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:40,440
out those old antibiotics and push them

835
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:42,870
out yeah you know and so it's got so

836
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:44,429
much work to do and then then what if

837
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:47,460
somebody had a big dinner the night

838
00:28:44,429 --> 00:28:49,290
before that's in the way the celery just

839
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:50,730
has to find its way into your liver it's

840
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:52,650
got to go down your intestinal tract

841
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:55,800
it's got to go up the hepatic portal

842
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:57,840
veins right up into the liver and then

843
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:59,550
it's got to go out of the liver and back

844
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:03,090
into the system it's unbelievable what

845
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:06,690
it has to do right and it's kind of

846
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:09,090
simple it's simple if you just accept

847
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:11,100
that and try it yes and then be amazed

848
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:13,140
and then you got people that got focused

849
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:15,870
concentration issues they got they got

850
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:17,070
brain issues and and yeah they got the

851
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:18,990
high anxiety they get focus

852
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:20,880
concentration they got it different

853
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:22,440
brain issues and then the sodium cluster

854
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,970
salts have the electrolytes have to find

855
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:25,710
their way to your brain so you need the

856
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:28,320
16 ounces to go all through that and

857
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:30,380
then find the way to the brain so you

858
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:32,160
can get sharp so you can get your your

859
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:33,570
neurotransmitters back so you can start

860
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,770
thinking see your electrical impulses

861
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:36,660
can do what they need to do so they

862
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:39,630
could run down the neurons and actually

863
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:41,910
fire so you can be sharp and quick it's

864
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:43,620
all of that I have a question so yeah

865
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:44,910
we're talking about the internal body

866
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:47,790
and there were a couple of questions

867
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:49,230
that came up on the last life about one

868
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:50,790
person said oh I had back pain but when

869
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:52,380
I started doing celery juice it went

870
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:53,970
away and another person said that they

871
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:56,010
had tennis elbow and when they started

872
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:58,080
consistently doing that so talk a little

873
00:29:56,010 --> 00:30:00,809
bit about like the external physical

874
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:04,110
skeletal muscular part of celery juice

875
00:30:00,809 --> 00:30:06,150
helping that yeah tennis elbow if you

876
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:07,950
have an injury it's one thing if you

877
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:10,020
have something mysterious happening like

878
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:12,840
tennis elbow mm-hmm where it's not

879
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:15,150
really an injury it's just not it's just

880
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:17,580
inflammation that's there you're dealing

881
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:19,020
with low-grade viral activity so when

882
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:20,880
you're drinking your celery juice you're

883
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:22,350
lowering your viral activity or you're

884
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,850
knocking down your Epstein Barr virus

885
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:26,580
you're knocking down your

886
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:29,250
hhv-6 or shingles viruses like the back

887
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:29,860
pain yeah back pain Epstein Barr doesn't

888
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:31,720
necessarily

889
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:33,250
go to the back to off minutes it's

890
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:36,280
actually rare that it heads to the back

891
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:38,320
too much but shingles always goes to the

892
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:39,970
back and you don't need a rash to have

893
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,890
that right you're drinking your celery

894
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:43,330
juice you're knocking down your shingles

895
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:45,370
inflammation right because that's what

896
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:45,910
happens people get this the sciatic

897
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:47,470
nerve

898
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:49,000
yeah and they get the static problem

899
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:50,559
since that's the whole point and you're

900
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,320
going every much jingles you should be

901
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:55,120
on celery juice mom yeah yeah that's for

902
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:57,520
my mom I played tennis my whole life

903
00:30:55,120 --> 00:31:00,340
very seriously very competitively and

904
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:02,610
the amount of tennis elbow that I came

905
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:05,080
across in my life that was always

906
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:06,640
unexplicable nobody knew really what to

907
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:09,490
do they tied a little band around your

908
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:11,020
forearm here to somehow relay and some

909
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:12,700
people would do it it still didn't work

910
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:16,540
and there was no there was it was

911
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:18,700
completely undiagnosed and and random

912
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:20,410
and I literally played thousands and

913
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:22,150
thousands of hours of competitive tennis

914
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:23,620
Wow and there was no reason for why one

915
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:25,179
person would have everybody's hitting

916
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:26,559
the same ball the same way to graça

917
00:31:25,179 --> 00:31:28,120
there's no reason but one person would

918
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:29,679
have it why wouldn't everybody get it

919
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:31,270
everybody's playing the same amount of

920
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:32,440
tennis and that makes a lot of sense

921
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:34,210
when you describe it

922
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:36,220
yeah when you're viral what happens is

923
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:38,140
that when you use a part of your body

924
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:41,320
when you use a part of your body a lot

925
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:43,270
and you've got a low-grade virus that's

926
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:46,090
in the body it takes advantage of

927
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:47,770
anything you're using too much interest

928
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:49,960
that's what happens I don't even know if

929
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:51,730
I talked about that in a radio sure if I

930
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:53,260
talked about this it's probably talked

931
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:54,520
about that in the focus I definitely

932
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:55,870
know I probably talked about that in the

933
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:57,940
books for sure but I haven't talked

934
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:59,919
about it only about that too much

935
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:01,330
if you're using too much of something

936
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:06,970
like you're using your back too much

937
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:08,440
you're using your leg to your knee if

938
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:09,640
you're using someone like that you got

939
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:11,320
the little great viral thing that we

940
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:13,030
cleaned up with you yeah that's what

941
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:15,669
happens saying the tennis elbow same

942
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:18,460
with tendonitis the whole tendinitis

943
00:32:15,669 --> 00:32:23,290
thing that whole thing that's all

944
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:25,179
yeah yeah all of that is low-grade viral

945
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:27,309
activity when you're using something too

946
00:32:25,179 --> 00:32:28,990
much whatever it is then what happens

947
00:32:27,309 --> 00:32:30,549
there yeah you start taking care of

948
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:32,020
yourself you get celery juice in you get

949
00:32:30,549 --> 00:32:34,150
the right information you're not doing

950
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:36,520
all that collagen junk powder which will

951
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:38,830
just make you sick I'd be doing yeah

952
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:40,600
yeah exactly gotta be careful whatever

953
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:41,890
dye you subscribe to does it matter

954
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:43,150
you got to be care and then you can

955
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:44,380
clean these viruses up

956
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:46,150
you know the protocols you learn the

957
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:49,110
supplements I get a new book coming out

958
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:51,340
that I'm not announcing it's a surprise

959
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:53,920
I've been announced a new book for him

960
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:55,930
know in the old days this is a

961
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:59,350
retraction but it's a live retraction

962
00:32:55,930 --> 00:33:00,880
right I mistakenly last time we were

963
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:03,880
here I said they haven't he was working

964
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:06,820
on a brain book and people responded

965
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:08,680
very positively about that instantly

966
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:11,140
about it it was a complete fabrication

967
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:12,910
on my part I misunderstood something

968
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:17,230
that I thought I knew I thought I'd

969
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:19,510
heard and he is not working on a brain

970
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:22,210
book so I I just want to say that

971
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:25,600
publicly so pleased I apologize for

972
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:27,940
getting people's hopes up there will be

973
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:29,800
a great book down down the road he gets

974
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:31,630
to say that yeah I don't there will be

975
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:36,090
there will be my bad I got a surprise

976
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:44,350
daddy myself from YouTube video I just

977
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:45,760
rated myself on the island yeah no I got

978
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:48,040
a surprise book coming I'm gonna talk

979
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:49,750
about the gut involved in there it's

980
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:51,580
gonna be like some of me a lot of that

981
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:53,350
it's gonna be really it's gonna be

982
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:55,570
mind-blowing I think when people get

983
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:56,620
this but I also so you want me to let

984
00:33:55,570 --> 00:33:59,050
you announce that you don't want me to

985
00:33:56,620 --> 00:34:01,270
announce yeah that's right but I will

986
00:33:59,050 --> 00:34:04,059
say I'm you know give people a hint know

987
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:05,740
I have over 200 different like illnesses

988
00:34:04,059 --> 00:34:08,139
conditions and symptoms in this book

989
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:10,780
also with how to address it with the

990
00:34:08,139 --> 00:34:13,600
right dosages great of supplementation

991
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:15,280
how to really move people forward like

992
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:17,470
never before even though all the books

993
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:26,710
do that yeah sure this is going to be

994
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:29,110
quite a surprise this comes directly

995
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:30,190
from me on the questions but again I

996
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:32,740
know a lot of people that suffer from

997
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:34,450
allergies and people always say oh my

998
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:36,280
gosh my allergies are horrible the

999
00:34:34,450 --> 00:34:38,530
pollens out there I've never had

1000
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:40,149
allergies and so but I do i do empathize

1001
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:41,440
because I have friends and family

1002
00:34:40,149 --> 00:34:44,379
members that suffer from it

1003
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:46,690
so why do we blame nature for allergies

1004
00:34:44,379 --> 00:34:48,129
like isn't it something because I mean

1005
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:49,870
if we're doing all this shouldn't we

1006
00:34:48,129 --> 00:34:52,210
eventually shouldn't that ologies

1007
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:53,679
eventually be cleared up why do we do

1008
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:54,740
when you take care of yourself they do

1009
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:56,810
it

1010
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:58,700
one just gets off of gluten their

1011
00:34:56,810 --> 00:35:01,820
allergies start to actually improve

1012
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:04,040
mm-hmm it's it's incredible because

1013
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:06,619
gluten and this is medical medium

1014
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:09,230
information feeds bugs nobody knew it

1015
00:35:06,619 --> 00:35:11,750
fed bugs like they took the whole gluten

1016
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:13,570
thing the wheat thing being bad all that

1017
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:16,010
information but not one single

1018
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:18,410
professional whether they come out with

1019
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:20,000
books are not new gluten feeds bugs

1020
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:21,710
until the medical media information came

1021
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,900
to town to teach people that's the

1022
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:25,730
reason why you get sick when you have

1023
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:27,740
gluten versus somebody else who doesn't

1024
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:29,420
get sick when they have gluten he says

1025
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:32,510
they don't have the bugs feeding off it

1026
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:34,940
as someone else does so that's how the

1027
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:36,680
warming okay so if you're if you're if

1028
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:39,710
you're somebody is high you know prone

1029
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:42,650
to allergies you have pathogens like

1030
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:44,390
bacteria and viruses in your liver and

1031
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:47,210
in your lymphatic system and in your

1032
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:48,560
sinuses and in places in your body so

1033
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:50,810
think you're gonna be now sensitive to

1034
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:52,910
other other things so we're gonna Paul

1035
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:54,920
and it's going those triggers those

1036
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:56,330
triggers but it's because you've got

1037
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:58,040
those things in your the blood in your

1038
00:35:56,330 --> 00:36:00,590
bio Buster because the bugs are already

1039
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:02,000
producing toxins like Mars has produced

1040
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:04,040
neurotoxins to actually make you

1041
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,980
chemical sensitive so the epstein-barr

1042
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:09,080
actually makes people chemical sensitive

1043
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:11,060
you know and then and then streptococcus

1044
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:14,390
gives people sensitivities in their

1045
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:15,010
lungs and in their sinuses and even in

1046
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:17,510
their bladder

1047
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:19,700
it gives them sensitivities they'll get

1048
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:21,470
the status feeling stuff go get the

1049
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:23,450
bladder irritation still get the sinus

1050
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:25,400
problems to sinus headaches they'll get

1051
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:27,560
the lung stuff they'll have you know all

1052
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:29,750
of that going on because they got this

1053
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:31,820
long-term chronic streptococcus

1054
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:33,560
infection and there's over 50 groups of

1055
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:35,330
streptococcus undiscovered by research

1056
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:37,640
and science with all with so many

1057
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:39,290
strains it's not even countable you can

1058
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:40,670
pick them up in a public bathroom you

1059
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:42,470
can pick them up in a restaurant doing

1060
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:44,270
we're eating restaurant food you can

1061
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:45,920
pick them up for relationships you can

1062
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:47,660
get a new strap that's highly enigmatic

1063
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:49,730
resistant from somebody who's got a

1064
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:50,750
strep you know in a relationship and

1065
00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:52,730
they've actually been you know

1066
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:54,230
bombarding it for antibiotics for 20

1067
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:56,090
years then you pick up the strep and now

1068
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:59,630
you got this strip and then strep is

1069
00:36:56,090 --> 00:37:01,400
just everywhere and so what happens is

1070
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:03,290
that you become sensitive you sensitive

1071
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:05,150
allergies pollen you can be sent you can

1072
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:07,100
be a young child that senses pollen

1073
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:08,880
because it's trap because children have

1074
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:11,489
strap they just

1075
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:13,410
they do they do and so you end up with

1076
00:37:11,489 --> 00:37:15,390
these long-term allergies but when you

1077
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:17,849
knock down that strap that streptococcus

1078
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:20,099
bacteria your allergies go away you get

1079
00:37:17,849 --> 00:37:23,220
rid of gluten your allergies can improve

1080
00:37:20,099 --> 00:37:25,140
great you get rid of dairy products your

1081
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:27,390
allergies actually start to improve you

1082
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:29,640
get rid of eggs they really start to

1083
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:30,839
improve and then okay and then you get

1084
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:32,339
somebody else they don't really have

1085
00:37:30,839 --> 00:37:33,599
much going on inside of them make it eat

1086
00:37:32,339 --> 00:37:34,859
whatever I mean I know people they're

1087
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:36,660
like nine years old they can eat what

1088
00:37:34,859 --> 00:37:39,089
they want sure I mean but they don't

1089
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:40,920
have maybe as many bugs so very very

1090
00:37:39,089 --> 00:37:42,690
little and they just they're just some

1091
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:46,440
of those old dinosaurs out there that

1092
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:47,819
that that don't exist anymore coming up

1093
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:49,920
the world has changed

1094
00:37:47,819 --> 00:37:51,809
yes mr. Silva this next question is

1095
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:54,180
exactly about that there was a question

1096
00:37:51,809 --> 00:37:55,529
that why do we have more pathogens today

1097
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:58,019
than we did in the yesteryear and there

1098
00:37:55,529 --> 00:38:00,690
was a flight attendant who said she's

1099
00:37:58,019 --> 00:38:03,960
been you know flying for over 20 years

1100
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:06,150
and she noticed that seems to be so much

1101
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:07,829
more chronic illness from she was seeing

1102
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:09,930
customers coming on the plane you know

1103
00:38:07,829 --> 00:38:11,789
every day in her in her career just

1104
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:13,559
saying so many more chronic illnesses

1105
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:15,719
now than there was when she started from

1106
00:38:13,559 --> 00:38:18,180
yeah yeah because because what's

1107
00:38:15,719 --> 00:38:20,279
happening well that's why the industry

1108
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:22,950
wants to blame it on your genes they

1109
00:38:20,279 --> 00:38:25,650
want to say that literally yeah the

1110
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:27,930
global population our genes went bad in

1111
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:30,059
the last 30 years that's what they want

1112
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:32,880
to say yeah they want it they want us to

1113
00:38:30,059 --> 00:38:35,009
believe and they want women to believe

1114
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:38,940
especially women yeah they want women to

1115
00:38:35,009 --> 00:38:41,099
believe their genes are bad that's what

1116
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:43,589
they want because it's a way to control

1117
00:38:41,099 --> 00:38:46,200
women it's disempowerment yeah that's

1118
00:38:43,589 --> 00:38:50,700
how the industry's work if women get too

1119
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:53,069
much power the world gets better that's

1120
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:54,839
how it works I mean I mean what happens

1121
00:38:53,069 --> 00:38:55,739
so you have the key to land without keep

1122
00:38:54,839 --> 00:38:58,229
them in the dark

1123
00:38:55,739 --> 00:39:01,200
keep them sick teach women that their

1124
00:38:58,229 --> 00:39:03,509
bodies attacking itself which is which

1125
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:05,910
is evil yeah that's the autoimmune

1126
00:39:03,509 --> 00:39:07,319
theory that your body's attacking itself

1127
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:09,869
so they want to teach women that your

1128
00:39:07,319 --> 00:39:11,700
body's attacking itself and it's sad

1129
00:39:09,869 --> 00:39:15,150
because they'll use women doctors to do

1130
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:17,519
it the only thing women doctors they'll

1131
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:19,410
use women doctors to actually do it to

1132
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:21,150
carry that on then you know your bodies

1133
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:22,510
are destroying itself it's actually your

1134
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:24,130
body's immune system is just

1135
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:26,110
- thyroid causing Hashimoto's your

1136
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:28,810
body's immune system is destroying your

1137
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:31,150
skin causing eczema psoriasis it's a

1138
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:34,150
technique of the industry to use

1139
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:37,030
something that has no science behind it

1140
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:39,120
that's valid whatsoever because they've

1141
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:42,100
never seen the auto antibody they

1142
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:45,160
supposedly see they've never seen it

1143
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:47,350
create an issue in an organ ever it's

1144
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:49,330
not possible so they have no proof

1145
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:52,420
whatsoever it was a theory that came out

1146
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:55,930
in the 1950s no really in the 1950s when

1147
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:58,390
when technology was what in 1949 and

1148
00:39:55,930 --> 00:40:00,040
1950 52 think about it so it was a

1149
00:39:58,390 --> 00:40:03,070
theory that your body's attacking itself

1150
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:05,770
so they want to control women disempower

1151
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:07,330
them kick them down keep them down by

1152
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:09,340
keeping everybody sick with chronic

1153
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:11,440
illness especially women by telling them

1154
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:13,030
their body's attacking itself or it's

1155
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:15,670
your genes or bowles

1156
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:17,230
yeah and so there's a reason for this

1157
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:18,370
because then you think your genes are

1158
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:21,670
bad so you better get your breasts

1159
00:40:18,370 --> 00:40:23,410
removed yeah that's how it's done your

1160
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:23,830
genes are bad so you better something

1161
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:26,500
else

1162
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:28,960
Eugene and the reason why they do this

1163
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:31,330
is because the industry has to protect

1164
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:34,480
itself because it doesn't have the

1165
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:36,310
answers right right so it doesn't have

1166
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:38,110
the answers it just does and one

1167
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:40,540
examples Lyme disease medical medium

1168
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:43,600
information has moved to the Lyme

1169
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:45,370
disease diagnosis the industry changed

1170
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:48,340
it because of medical media right they

1171
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:52,230
took it out of bacterial and they put it

1172
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:54,850
in autoimmune because of the books

1173
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:57,490
because the books have went around to so

1174
00:40:54,850 --> 00:41:01,810
many doctors so many people around the

1175
00:40:57,490 --> 00:41:03,430
play had to put it into something else

1176
00:41:01,810 --> 00:41:05,200
they had a shifted because the Lyme

1177
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:07,420
disease is viable right it's not

1178
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,800
bacterial this is a prime example so you

1179
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:10,960
stuck it in autoimmune now they're

1180
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:12,220
trying to shift the game they put it not

1181
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,780
on me to mean the meaning they don't

1182
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:15,190
know what causes Lyme disease now and

1183
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:16,480
the Lyme labs are hurting because of

1184
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:18,070
this will leave me there hurt and

1185
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:20,290
they've note the big industry off of

1186
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:22,270
that and they're hurting so they moved

1187
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:24,790
it off often to autoimmune into the

1188
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:27,700
history it's it's shifting and to miss

1189
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:29,800
realness but then they can say it's your

1190
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:32,140
genes that's causing a lot of disease

1191
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:33,130
now or autoimmune and your body keeps

1192
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:35,170
swimming down because you're

1193
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:38,320
disempowered you don't please

1194
00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:41,170
you don't have the answers to really

1195
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:43,120
help yourself heal yeah and so you think

1196
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:44,890
your body's the problem isn't that body

1197
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:47,770
shaming you have been saying this for a

1198
00:41:44,890 --> 00:41:49,840
feel ever it's it this is the new body

1199
00:41:47,770 --> 00:41:52,570
shaming that's happening with the

1200
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:54,340
industries and no one even sees it they

1201
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:56,920
just accept it like we're just supposed

1202
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:58,390
to be brainwashed and accept it and you

1203
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:00,100
know what ability when said when a

1204
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:01,900
doctor tells that to you and I had one

1205
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:04,960
talk how many years ago before I had

1206
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:06,640
thyroid issues it come I can remember

1207
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:08,020
the feeling the minute the doctor said

1208
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:10,570
it to me I remember the feeling it's

1209
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:12,160
like I can sit remember it to in one

1210
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:13,450
second I was sitting in a chair he said

1211
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:16,000
it and there was a feeling that went

1212
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:18,310
through my entire body that just it felt

1213
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,690
horrible that my body would be attacking

1214
00:42:18,310 --> 00:42:20,890
itself and it's I've never ever

1215
00:42:19,690 --> 00:42:22,540
forgotten it and I was probably about

1216
00:42:20,890 --> 00:42:24,400
thirty years old so that was 32 years

1217
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:27,790
ago yeah well you know when you're

1218
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:29,290
telling a 16 year old a daughter when

1219
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:30,760
they're telling you know 16 year old a

1220
00:42:29,290 --> 00:42:32,470
15 year old and they're looking online

1221
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:34,330
and they see they have Hashimoto's and

1222
00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:38,320
then they see that their bodies are

1223
00:42:34,330 --> 00:42:41,050
attacking itself at age 15 this is on

1224
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:43,900
purpose because they've never ever seen

1225
00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:45,910
in a study or a test that the body is

1226
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:49,030
attacking itself so why would they do

1227
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:51,130
that to our kids why would they do that

1228
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:54,310
when they have no proof there's never

1229
00:42:51,130 --> 00:42:56,290
been a study to prove it yeah how is it

1230
00:42:54,310 --> 00:42:58,270
possible that they're actually putting

1231
00:42:56,290 --> 00:43:01,270
that I'm in right now that information

1232
00:42:58,270 --> 00:43:04,240
out there because they want to yeah

1233
00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:07,720
that's what they want for desperate for

1234
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:09,840
answers and they they want that you go

1235
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:11,980
into it we've been trained to go into it

1236
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:14,620
believing everything their doctor says

1237
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:17,620
yeah because and instead of my dad have

1238
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:21,070
a saying said if you don't know say you

1239
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:22,960
don't know yeah but but no that's if

1240
00:43:21,070 --> 00:43:25,180
that's honest that's yeah we don't know

1241
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,590
so maybe there's some other medical

1242
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:28,120
people saying what do you mean you don't

1243
00:43:26,590 --> 00:43:29,470
know you're my doctor you if you don't

1244
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:32,740
know then what's gonna happen to me

1245
00:43:29,470 --> 00:43:34,630
there are doctors who say to me

1246
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:36,490
the world is changing there there are a

1247
00:43:34,630 --> 00:43:39,460
couple of doctors that have said to me a

1248
00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:41,050
couple of Surgeons actually and another

1249
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:42,790
doctor that just said we just we don't

1250
00:43:41,050 --> 00:43:44,530
know we don't have the answers and that

1251
00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:46,420
was the most honest thing and I

1252
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:47,470
respected those doctors because it takes

1253
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:49,660
a lot of courage to say

1254
00:43:47,470 --> 00:43:51,880
doctors are incredible yes science and

1255
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:53,770
research that's not coming out and

1256
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:55,359
saying we don't have the answers right

1257
00:43:53,770 --> 00:43:57,760
because they're protecting its

1258
00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:59,320
protecting its of course and and so it's

1259
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,520
not being honest and saying we don't

1260
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:02,410
have the answers of why you have

1261
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:04,060
excellent psoriasis we don't have the

1262
00:44:02,410 --> 00:44:05,050
answers where you have Hashimoto's we

1263
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:06,670
don't have the answers where you have

1264
00:44:05,050 --> 00:44:09,490
multiple sclerosis we don't have the

1265
00:44:06,670 --> 00:44:12,310
answers with whatever this is and so

1266
00:44:09,490 --> 00:44:14,710
instead they don't care doctors care

1267
00:44:12,310 --> 00:44:17,230
yeah doctors care they care what they

1268
00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:18,910
care they're in it to care yeah but

1269
00:44:17,230 --> 00:44:21,400
science and research doesn't care about

1270
00:44:18,910 --> 00:44:23,230
the doctors doesn't care about the

1271
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:26,230
doctors that get sick doesn't care about

1272
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:28,840
anybody because if it did it wouldn't

1273
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:30,520
torture 15 year old 16 year old 17 year

1274
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:32,470
olds I know mom's talk to me all the

1275
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:35,200
time or all through the years that

1276
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:38,140
literally their child is sitting there

1277
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:40,510
like thinking this is it it's over yeah

1278
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:42,400
because they found that wait a minute

1279
00:44:40,510 --> 00:44:46,060
there's this it's autoimmune

1280
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:49,240
and so that system set up to hurt people

1281
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:51,070
and you know what and then when you put

1282
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:53,349
out something to help reverse it all

1283
00:44:51,070 --> 00:44:54,849
help you know get people better they

1284
00:44:53,349 --> 00:44:56,380
attack someone is using say there's no

1285
00:44:54,849 --> 00:44:57,580
science of research behind celery juice

1286
00:44:56,380 --> 00:44:59,500
meanwhile there's no science and

1287
00:44:57,580 --> 00:45:01,630
research about the body attack so that's

1288
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:03,420
actually valid right but no they'll

1289
00:45:01,630 --> 00:45:05,290
still turn around and say there's no

1290
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:08,200
soldiers use meanwhile people are

1291
00:45:05,290 --> 00:45:10,359
actually healing that's the good news

1292
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:12,310
do the celery juice for six months and

1293
00:45:10,359 --> 00:45:14,200
you see how you feel and you look at

1294
00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:15,700
your numbers my girlfriend I just went

1295
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:17,890
through breast cancer and she reversed

1296
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:19,750
her 100 180 degree with her diet

1297
00:45:17,890 --> 00:45:21,730
she no celery juice every day and you

1298
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:24,970
know very very little fat no added salt

1299
00:45:21,730 --> 00:45:27,160
or sugar she's really like amazing and

1300
00:45:24,970 --> 00:45:28,780
all of her numbers have drastically

1301
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:29,800
changed in less than a year and all of

1302
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:31,900
her doctors have said how are you doing

1303
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:34,510
and she's like through diet through all

1304
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:36,160
of this food and it's been amazing and

1305
00:45:34,510 --> 00:45:37,960
that is science that's her own science

1306
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:40,030
and research she's done okay I'm gonna

1307
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:41,770
move on to something light-hearted will

1308
00:45:40,030 --> 00:45:44,440
you tell the story you tell the story I

1309
00:45:41,770 --> 00:45:45,849
think Anthony told the story maybe in

1310
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:48,550
one of your podcasters oh no you're

1311
00:45:45,849 --> 00:45:50,680
scaring me no no I'm scared it's really

1312
00:45:48,550 --> 00:45:51,569
a great story because I want to try one

1313
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:54,029
of the things that Ivan

1314
00:45:51,569 --> 00:45:56,400
wanting to do is to try to find somebody

1315
00:45:54,029 --> 00:45:57,779
who can teach like wild food gathering

1316
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:59,940
and that what does it call like I'm

1317
00:45:57,779 --> 00:46:02,699
foraging I kind of want to do that and

1318
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:03,390
it reminded me of the story of the

1319
00:46:02,699 --> 00:46:08,160
fiddle firm

1320
00:46:03,390 --> 00:46:10,410
oh yeah the fiddlehead ferns because you

1321
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:12,719
can eat fiddlehead ferns so it's

1322
00:46:10,410 --> 00:46:14,839
inedible to wild edible plant you know

1323
00:46:12,719 --> 00:46:18,209
I've spent a lot of my early childhood

1324
00:46:14,839 --> 00:46:19,650
like gathering wild food because my

1325
00:46:18,209 --> 00:46:21,839
source tells me what's good what's bad

1326
00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:23,849
whatever and I would eat all kinds of

1327
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:26,880
weird mushrooms out in the field you

1328
00:46:23,849 --> 00:46:28,680
come across a mushroom and yeah all

1329
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:30,420
right I'm gonna risk it don't do that

1330
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:31,709
though don't pick wild mushrooms don't

1331
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:34,289
play with that don't risk

1332
00:46:31,709 --> 00:46:37,829
don't risk that it's not worth it no I

1333
00:46:34,289 --> 00:46:40,650
mean I have known professionals that

1334
00:46:37,829 --> 00:46:43,319
know their mushrooms huh data burn their

1335
00:46:40,650 --> 00:46:46,259
tongue out of their mouth literally

1336
00:46:43,319 --> 00:46:47,699
because of putting the wrong wild

1337
00:46:46,259 --> 00:46:49,829
mushroom on their tongue why they were

1338
00:46:47,699 --> 00:46:51,989
out in the field you know and I've

1339
00:46:49,829 --> 00:46:54,209
always said just I don't just don't play

1340
00:46:51,989 --> 00:46:56,579
with it yeah yeah don't play with

1341
00:46:54,209 --> 00:46:58,440
mushrooms and you know and I would you

1342
00:46:56,579 --> 00:47:00,900
know but fiddlehead ferns they taste so

1343
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:03,059
good and you know so I just Saturday

1344
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:05,459
take I just sat in this little area that

1345
00:47:03,059 --> 00:47:07,920
I found a big crop and I just ate one

1346
00:47:05,459 --> 00:47:09,359
after another until the spirits say

1347
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:12,059
don't eat too much don't eat too many

1348
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:15,299
because they're so they're so not only

1349
00:47:12,059 --> 00:47:18,119
medicinal but they have like an alkaloid

1350
00:47:15,299 --> 00:47:19,769
on them that you're just really tough on

1351
00:47:18,119 --> 00:47:22,019
the intestinal tract if you've eaten way

1352
00:47:19,769 --> 00:47:24,239
too many of them there so they have this

1353
00:47:22,019 --> 00:47:26,219
bitter alkaloid that it just could make

1354
00:47:24,239 --> 00:47:28,410
you just feel so sick if you overeat

1355
00:47:26,219 --> 00:47:30,539
these you know maybe four or five of

1356
00:47:28,410 --> 00:47:33,029
them are fine you know and I don't know

1357
00:47:30,539 --> 00:47:37,079
I must have eaten 30 or 40 or 50 of them

1358
00:47:33,029 --> 00:47:40,319
I was just laying in a patch just I was

1359
00:47:37,079 --> 00:47:43,859
in fetal position I was laying in a

1360
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:45,329
patch I was so sad and then you know

1361
00:47:43,859 --> 00:47:46,920
what after I got over it

1362
00:47:45,329 --> 00:47:49,559
I picked a whole you know I picked a

1363
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:51,180
whole like bale of a more and just

1364
00:47:49,559 --> 00:47:52,739
brought him back to the house and ate

1365
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:55,589
him again and then that was it I was

1366
00:47:52,739 --> 00:47:58,010
just it was the stupidest thing it was

1367
00:47:55,589 --> 00:48:04,790
the stupidest thing

1368
00:47:58,010 --> 00:48:06,980
yeah you ain't even tell the story good

1369
00:48:04,790 --> 00:48:08,750
and you know there was - two times it

1370
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:11,540
happened there is a time work there's a

1371
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:13,250
store that had into while yeah

1372
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:15,740
I've been mean and then I bought a

1373
00:48:13,250 --> 00:48:17,930
marinade over ate them because you know

1374
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:20,930
what it is it's like it's like it's like

1375
00:48:17,930 --> 00:48:23,210
when something tastes so good and it's

1376
00:48:20,930 --> 00:48:26,320
so good for you you just say you know

1377
00:48:23,210 --> 00:48:26,320
what a little bit more why not

1378
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:38,839
you know I've sat in a while too many

1379
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,970
Oreo

1380
00:48:38,839 --> 00:48:43,490
picking wild blueberries until I

1381
00:48:40,970 --> 00:48:45,410
couldn't eat another like I just like

1382
00:48:43,490 --> 00:48:48,410
just till I just laid in a wild

1383
00:48:45,410 --> 00:48:51,050
blueberry feels like blue from my toe

1384
00:48:48,410 --> 00:48:52,880
and just stuff that wild blueberries

1385
00:48:51,050 --> 00:48:54,800
because it's just that one moment where

1386
00:48:52,880 --> 00:49:06,800
you know you get a chance to do that in

1387
00:48:54,800 --> 00:49:08,569
your life it's a special moment okay so

1388
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:09,980
some people wanted to know what we ate

1389
00:49:08,569 --> 00:49:11,810
the rest of the day because on the last

1390
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:14,300
live I guess it sounded like all we ate

1391
00:49:11,810 --> 00:49:19,099
was donors you the celery juice and the

1392
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:20,690
lemon water and Alan and and and our

1393
00:49:19,099 --> 00:49:23,450
heavy-metal detox smoothie which is not

1394
00:49:20,690 --> 00:49:24,980
all we eat but we obviously we do a lot

1395
00:49:23,450 --> 00:49:27,319
of recipes that are in Anthony's books

1396
00:49:24,980 --> 00:49:29,960
we love the spaghetti bolognaise that's

1397
00:49:27,319 --> 00:49:32,329
amazing and we do that for gas a lot

1398
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:33,890
that come over we I make the quiche a

1399
00:49:32,329 --> 00:49:36,170
lot probably once every couple of weeks

1400
00:49:33,890 --> 00:49:38,270
and I was going to say if you're able to

1401
00:49:36,170 --> 00:49:41,960
make your own food and do some of the

1402
00:49:38,270 --> 00:49:45,680
recipes do them in bulk because you can

1403
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:47,690
like I made the the quiche last week and

1404
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:49,490
Scott was in you know New Orleans and I

1405
00:49:47,690 --> 00:49:51,770
had a girlfriend over and we both had

1406
00:49:49,490 --> 00:49:52,849
and then I had it like for lunch the

1407
00:49:51,770 --> 00:49:54,170
next day and then the next day for

1408
00:49:52,849 --> 00:49:56,119
dinner I just threw it with a bunch of

1409
00:49:54,170 --> 00:49:58,010
greens and a little bit of lemon on the

1410
00:49:56,119 --> 00:50:00,920
greens and a quarter of an avocado and

1411
00:49:58,010 --> 00:50:02,900
that was my dinner and we also do the

1412
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:05,300
lentil I do the lentil tacos that's

1413
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:06,800
really fabulous and easy it's mostly

1414
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:09,650
chopping it doesn't really take a lot of

1415
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:10,840
time the potato pancakes we've done for

1416
00:50:09,650 --> 00:50:13,090
a lot of our

1417
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:15,820
dinner parties those are delicious and

1418
00:50:13,090 --> 00:50:17,110
then ours kind of standard dinners like

1419
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:19,360
when we're running around we don't have

1420
00:50:17,110 --> 00:50:21,370
time to you know cook or plant a menu is

1421
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:23,500
just stick and potato and you know in

1422
00:50:21,370 --> 00:50:25,900
the oven or steamed potatoes with some

1423
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:27,880
kind of steamed veggies and a salad we

1424
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:29,740
do that a lot or we have a rice dish

1425
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:31,150
that's really easy to make we'll prepare

1426
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:33,250
the rice ahead of time and there's this

1427
00:50:31,150 --> 00:50:35,560
great rice here in California called

1428
00:50:33,250 --> 00:50:38,920
Kota Kota farms and it's there it's

1429
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:40,330

do rice and then we'll roast a sunflower

1434
00:50:49,990 --> 00:50:55,690
seeds and some sesame seeds in a pan

1435
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:57,730
with no oil and then we'll take the rice

1436
00:50:55,690 --> 00:50:59,320
and mix the seeds up and put a little

1437
00:50:57,730 --> 00:51:01,300
Bragg's the coconut Bragg's

1439
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:05,070
a great side for you know all the

1440
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:11,380

00:51:05,070 --> 00:51:19,750
veggie that you want people mango frozen

that and we do a homemade granola we'll

1444
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:27,520
mix in with some coconut you know fresh

1445
00:51:25,450 --> 00:51:29,050
coconut that is not fat-free so we'll I

1446
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:30,610
usually I used to have that in the

1447
00:51:29,050 --> 00:51:31,840
morning but ever since the liver rescue

1448
00:51:30,610 --> 00:51:33,610
came out I do that either in the

1449
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:35,170
afternoon or sometimes even if I'm

1450
00:51:33,610 --> 00:51:36,430
really tired and I don't feel like

1451
00:51:35,170 --> 00:51:38,290
making dinner I'll do it at night for

1452
00:51:36,430 --> 00:51:42,490
dinner and that'll be it gluten free

1453
00:51:38,290 --> 00:51:44,650
pasta with tomato spinach those kinds of

1454
00:51:42,490 --> 00:51:46,630
things we also just learned that we

1455
00:51:44,650 --> 00:51:48,970
don't we make zoodles we make noodles

1456
00:51:46,630 --> 00:51:50,560
from zucchini yeah and we get to I just

1457
00:51:48,970 --> 00:51:52,150
got like a little doodle you know in a

1458
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:55,830
little what do they call it where you

1459
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:58,300
make the spiralizer just to put the

1460
00:51:55,830 --> 00:52:00,190
zucchini in there and you turn it and it

1461
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:03,100
makes little noodles and I'll make like

1462
00:52:00,190 --> 00:52:04,750
a really fresh red sauce and anything

1463
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:06,640
that you want to saute if you want it to

1464
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:08,350
be fat-free like he says and all of his

1465
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:10,360
lectures and stuff that you can just

1466
00:52:08,350 --> 00:52:12,790
saute your onions and garlic or whatever

1467
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:14,710
in either water or I use vegetable broth

1468
00:52:12,790 --> 00:52:16,930
that I make from scratch so I freeze a

1469
00:52:14,710 --> 00:52:19,120
lot of vegetable broth and little you

1470
00:52:16,930 --> 00:52:21,580
know jars and then I just defrosted and

1471
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:23,160
I sauteed in that and then I'll throw

1472
00:52:21,580 --> 00:52:25,170
them in like fresh tomato

1473
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:26,760
and then you throw the zoodles in and

1474
00:52:25,170 --> 00:52:28,830
you just turn the zoodles over like for

1475
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:30,330
even a minute and it just barely cooks

1476
00:52:28,830 --> 00:52:32,250
it if you overcook it then it releases

1477
00:52:30,330 --> 00:52:33,720
that sort of zucchini taste which if you

1478
00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:35,550
like that that's great or if you want it

1479
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:39,480
to be al dente I'm not kidding it tastes

1480
00:52:35,550 --> 00:52:42,480
like capellini pasta yes so great and

1481
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:45,540
it's agression yummy so we do that once

1482
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:46,830
in a while and yeah so those are a lot

1483
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:50,040
of the other things a lot of leafy

1484
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:51,660
greens that we you know the rest of the

1485
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:54,270
day it's not just celery juice all day

1486
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:57,260
that's amazing that's incredible I'm

1487
00:52:54,270 --> 00:52:57,260
like actually getting hungry now

1488
00:53:02,150 --> 00:53:05,670
no that's incredible and people could do

1489
00:53:04,470 --> 00:53:07,080
a little bit of fat you know they can

1490
00:53:05,670 --> 00:53:08,880
put a little bit of their fats they're

1491
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:10,950
high quality fats in their food it's

1492
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:12,540
just so much but it's such an over

1493
00:53:10,950 --> 00:53:15,030
an intimidation as that yeah that's

1494
00:53:12,540 --> 00:53:16,530
going on people are overdoing it it's

1495
00:53:15,030 --> 00:53:19,020
like look if you got a chronic illness

1496
00:53:16,530 --> 00:53:20,790
if you got symptoms you don't want there

1497
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:22,500
if you got you know if you're dealing

1498
00:53:20,790 --> 00:53:24,390
with even acne you mean you're doing

1499
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:26,190
that or something else you want to make

1500
00:53:24,390 --> 00:53:28,140
sure you lower them or even eliminate

1501
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:31,290
them for a while art or to maybe like

1502
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:33,030
exactly one of the you know the 20 day

1503
00:53:31,290 --> 00:53:35,400
cleanse in the first day can keep the

1504
00:53:33,030 --> 00:53:37,320
paxil or whatever it is but yeah yeah no

1505
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:39,510
that's a credible diet though like

1506
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:41,400
that's an amazing diet yeah that's kind

1507
00:53:39,510 --> 00:53:43,350
of our our standard and then a lot of

1508
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:45,780
people are asking are we 100% no we're

1509
00:53:43,350 --> 00:53:48,120
not 100% I mean we make mistakes or we

1510
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:50,310
yes everybody's everything stuff

1511
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:51,870
sometimes it yeah sometimes we're like

1512
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:54,630
we don't have the time to do it or

1513
00:53:51,870 --> 00:53:56,310
whatever but and it's also a process

1514
00:53:54,630 --> 00:53:58,140
like I've been doing this for six years

1515
00:53:56,310 --> 00:54:00,090
so it didn't we didn't get to this place

1516
00:53:58,140 --> 00:54:01,770
where we're at right now two years ago

1517
00:54:00,090 --> 00:54:03,720
you know or four years ago we've been

1518
00:54:01,770 --> 00:54:05,670
slowly shifting and changing and cutting

1519
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:06,960
more and more things out and we like

1520
00:54:05,670 --> 00:54:09,030
Scott was saying on the way here we eat

1521
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:10,440
it out at restaurants way way less

1522
00:54:09,030 --> 00:54:12,600
because if you've heard the restaurant

1523
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:16,440
podcast on restaurants oh that's scary

1524
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:23,670
but we eat a lot less than when we drew

1525
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:25,530
and everybody's oh my god but when we

1526
00:54:23,670 --> 00:54:27,600
went to a restaurant about a year ago

1527
00:54:25,530 --> 00:54:29,640
and we had heard about it I'd seen it

1528
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:30,770
being promoted by a bunch of different

1529
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:32,600
people on Instagram and different

1530
00:54:30,770 --> 00:54:34,550
places and it was close to her so I was

1531
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:37,850
like oh yay a new place so we went there

1532
00:54:34,550 --> 00:54:39,350
and I for some reason I got a hit to ask

1533
00:54:37,850 --> 00:54:41,000
a general ill ask do you use control

1534
00:54:39,350 --> 00:54:42,410
oiled and I'll ask questions and you

1535
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,640
know if I see corn on the minyak make

1536
00:54:42,410 --> 00:54:45,650
sure you know please don't put any corn

1537
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:46,820
on and whatever I'm ordering for some

1538
00:54:45,650 --> 00:54:48,530
reason I asked about nutritional yeast

1539
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:49,760
and I said well what about then they

1540
00:54:48,530 --> 00:54:51,590
said oh we have a nutritional yeast in

1541
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:53,930
that like okay what about this literally

1542
00:54:51,590 --> 00:54:56,210
everything on the menu happy release so

1543
00:54:53,930 --> 00:54:58,820
beware of the vegan restaurants I mean I

1544
00:54:56,210 --> 00:55:01,580
know that they're vegan but there can be

1545
00:54:58,820 --> 00:55:02,840
lots of toxic ingredients in vegan well

1546
00:55:01,580 --> 00:55:04,220
you know no one else are pretty even

1547
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:08,150
even here's the funny everybody thinks

1548
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:10,460
he's great yeah everything's right all

1549
00:55:08,150 --> 00:55:13,160
the vegans use it they live off of it

1550
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:16,300
it's disastrous yeah I know people they

1551
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:19,160
put on a pop yeah it's toxic so oh no

1552
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:21,740
and be church leaders yeah yeah it's

1553
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:24,500
it's not it basically it's why it's a

1554
00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:26,150
form of glutamic acid that's what it is

1555
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:28,550
you can't have nutritional yeast without

1556
00:55:26,150 --> 00:55:30,860
glutamic acid being present so it's like

1557
00:55:28,550 --> 00:55:32,510
a form of MSG you know say you know a

1558
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:34,190
nutritional yeast company be like no

1559
00:55:32,510 --> 00:55:36,290
there's no MSG in our product there's no

1560
00:55:34,190 --> 00:55:38,270
way we don't have msg in here it's not

1561
00:55:36,290 --> 00:55:40,370
true there's just glutamic acid derives

1562
00:55:38,270 --> 00:55:42,500
from the gusto literally nutritional

1563
00:55:40,370 --> 00:55:44,470
yeast in the way it's created it's just

1564
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:47,930
it's naturally occurring but it's bad

1565
00:55:44,470 --> 00:55:49,580
and it's toxic so if you know if you're

1566
00:55:47,930 --> 00:55:51,230
putting in a nutritional yeast and

1567
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:52,580
everything yeah and people will be safe

1568
00:55:51,230 --> 00:55:54,110
why why isn't he talking about

1569
00:55:52,580 --> 00:55:55,940
nutritional miso because if I'm not

1570
00:55:54,110 --> 00:55:57,530
talking about it don't do it

1571
00:55:55,940 --> 00:56:00,260
yeah don't do it that's the whole thing

1572
00:55:57,530 --> 00:56:02,210
and or if I'm talking about it bad like

1573
00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:03,890
I have before I have mentioned don't you

1574
00:56:02,210 --> 00:56:05,990
don't do the nutritional yeast

1575
00:56:03,890 --> 00:56:07,460
it'll slow down your healing if somebody

1576
00:56:05,990 --> 00:56:09,110
be like I did his medical medium

1577
00:56:07,460 --> 00:56:10,490
information I did it for a year it

1578
00:56:09,110 --> 00:56:12,470
didn't move me forward they did

1579
00:56:10,490 --> 00:56:13,160
nutritionally East all the time I got a

1580
00:56:12,470 --> 00:56:16,040
whole thing

1581
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:18,320
I mean seriously think I don't know this

1582
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:20,060
like I'm blinking there's a spice in

1583
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:21,920
that you recommend in a lot of the

1584
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:24,080
recipes and in the spaghetti bolognaise

1585
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:25,520
and it's the poultry seasoning and

1586
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:27,590
remember seeing that - like poultry

1587
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:28,580
seasoning what because I'm thinking

1588
00:56:27,590 --> 00:56:30,020
there's poultry nut but then of course

1589
00:56:28,580 --> 00:56:33,680
you read the ingredients and it's just a

1590
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:36,050
bunch of herbs and it's it's there it's

1591
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:37,580
recommended for some of the recipes so I

1592
00:56:36,050 --> 00:56:38,870
would think whatever you're putting

1593
00:56:37,580 --> 00:56:40,010
nutritional yeast on get rid of the

1594
00:56:38,870 --> 00:56:41,810
nutritional yeast and maybe try the

1595
00:56:40,010 --> 00:56:43,220
poultry seasoning on stuff you'll have a

1596
00:56:41,810 --> 00:56:43,470
better shot with it you know the thing

1597
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:46,380
is

1598
00:56:43,470 --> 00:56:48,660
with msg it's it sneaks into everything

1599
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:50,640
it sneaks into all these different

1600
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:51,660
things and what happens is migraines

1601
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:53,820
nutritional yeast

1602
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:55,830
it can give you migraines it can give

1603
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:57,630
you headaches it can up your anxiety

1604
00:56:55,830 --> 00:56:58,980
game you can do all these different

1605
00:56:57,630 --> 00:57:01,380
things even if you're just using a

1606
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:03,119
little bit same with natural flavors

1607
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:04,890
it's another thing someone will say yeah

1608
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:06,300
look I did medical medium information

1609
00:57:04,890 --> 00:57:08,220
for a month and it helped me a little

1610
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:09,990
bit but didn't take me all the way they

1611
00:57:08,220 --> 00:57:12,270
were doing natural flavors and 10 items

1612
00:57:09,990 --> 00:57:16,050
I mean I've talked to people that do

1613
00:57:12,270 --> 00:57:18,060
everything labors and also like natural

1614
00:57:16,050 --> 00:57:21,030

1615
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:23,160
right yeah you know what extract is not

1616
00:57:21,030 --> 00:57:25,680

based you know flavoring so vanilla

1618
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:30,960
extract is different but vanilla

1619
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:33,900
flavoring you know a flavoring organic

1620
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:36,720
flavoring is msg if you see organic

that's msg if you see raspberry flavor

1626
00:57:48,170 --> 00:57:53,700

1627
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:55,380
it says no GMO all whatever all

1628
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:57,570

1629
00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:58,140
thing and there's flavor yeah in there

1630
00:57:57,570 --> 00:58:01,530
somewhere

1631
00:57:58,140 --> 00:58:03,750
that's msg that's how it's done so you

1632
00:58:01,530 --> 00:58:05,040
know and people don't know that so

1633
00:58:03,750 --> 00:58:06,510
they're getting the natural flavors

1634
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:10,260
they're pounding the nutritional yeast

1635
00:58:06,510 --> 00:58:12,420
are doing the high fats you know they do

1636
00:58:10,260 --> 00:58:14,580
the celery juice for two weeks and go on

1637
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:16,320
YouTube and say why I quit celery juice

1638
00:58:14,580 --> 00:58:19,440
after two weeks meanwhile celery juice

1639
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:21,660
to save countless lives yeah around the

1640
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:23,730
globe literally from death defying

1641
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:25,740
diseases so there's so much

1642
00:58:23,730 --> 00:58:28,200
misinformation and how it works and how

1643
00:58:25,740 --> 00:58:30,210
it's all set up out there it's

1644
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:33,000
incredible so I mean but yeah that's a

1645
00:58:30,210 --> 00:58:36,510
really good thing boys are we are we

1646
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:38,040
close to being over I think yeah we're

1647
00:58:36,510 --> 00:58:39,630
close do you want to say we're close

1648
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:41,040
we're almost at an hour do you want to

1649
00:58:39,630 --> 00:58:43,200
say anything about disinformation

1650
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:45,300
or misinformation that's out there yeah

1651
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:47,210
absolutely because it's hard sometimes I

1652
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:49,589
think it's hard for people to discern

1653
00:58:47,210 --> 00:58:51,170
whether it's misinformation and there is

1654
00:58:49,589 --> 00:58:53,880
so much information out there it's crazy

1655
00:58:51,170 --> 00:58:56,550
for me I just follow what Anthony says

1656
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:58,140
that's how like that's how I I am

1657
00:58:56,550 --> 00:58:59,220
dissect the misinformation and people

1658
00:58:58,140 --> 00:59:00,450
ask me all the time what about this one

1659
00:58:59,220 --> 00:59:01,950
that I'm like I don't know if it's in

1660
00:59:00,450 --> 00:59:03,780
the book if he's talking about it that's

1661
00:59:01,950 --> 00:59:05,250
what I do if he's not I just let it go

1662
00:59:03,780 --> 00:59:07,830
misinformation has been out there for

1663
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:10,950
decades people been sick for decades

1664
00:59:07,830 --> 00:59:13,200
because of it it's not new it's just

1665
00:59:10,950 --> 00:59:17,310
that the younger people haven't learned

1666
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:20,010
yet yeah but the people who are 50 or 40

1667
00:59:17,310 --> 00:59:20,940
they medically the hell or 60 they've

1668
00:59:20,010 --> 00:59:23,220
been through the hell they've been

1669
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:24,900
through years of misinformation finally

1670
00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:26,670
found the right source which is the

1671
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:29,700
American medium information finally knew

1672
00:59:26,670 --> 00:59:31,560
how to heal meanwhile when you're young

1673
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:34,020
you're just gonna get swamped in all

1674
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:36,570
that misinformation because every 10

1675
00:59:34,020 --> 00:59:39,210
years everybody forgets that the whole

1676
00:59:36,570 --> 00:59:40,920
Candida theory didn't work they know

1677
00:59:39,210 --> 00:59:43,260
they keep on forgetting and they

1678
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:45,090
repackage and remain things and then

1679
00:59:43,260 --> 00:59:47,520
they threw like the lectin thing at you

1680
00:59:45,090 --> 00:59:48,990
which is actually all rubbish then they

1681
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:50,280
throw something else at you and then

1682
00:59:48,990 --> 00:59:52,440
they throw something else at you then

1683
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:54,300
they think it's endless and you just get

1684
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:58,170
tangled up in the misinformation and

1685
00:59:54,300 --> 01:00:01,020
it's all backed by paid-for studies when

1686
00:59:58,170 --> 01:00:03,810
you can I could get a paid for stuff

1687
01:00:01,020 --> 01:00:05,580
sort of me you can get a pay for I think

1688
01:00:03,810 --> 01:00:08,220
it a paid for study and make it look

1689
01:00:05,580 --> 01:00:10,710
like oh okay this is now cited rice is a

1690
01:00:08,220 --> 01:00:13,560
paid for study all you need is money and

1691
01:00:10,710 --> 01:00:15,390
then you do the money okay and then you

1692
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:17,790
get the study done yeah and then you

1693
01:00:15,390 --> 01:00:20,520
haven't support your cause which you

1694
01:00:17,790 --> 01:00:22,380
will make money that's the game so all

1695
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:25,140

1696
01:00:22,380 --> 01:00:27,300
