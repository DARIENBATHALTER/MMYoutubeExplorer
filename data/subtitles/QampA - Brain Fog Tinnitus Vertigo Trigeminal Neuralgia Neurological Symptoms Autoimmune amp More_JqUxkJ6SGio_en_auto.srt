Machinery every single person back 20

74
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,920
years ago 30 years ago whatever every

or some kind of like sound going off in

77
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:15,720
the a or some kind of buzzing were told

78
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:17,599
they were like deciel damaged by

79
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:21,040
something were you around Machinery were

80
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:24,400
you around this did did a baseball were

81
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:26,319
you at a baseball park and a baseball

82
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,439
flew and hit you in the head did it hit

83
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:31,000
you in the ear ma'am that's how it was

84
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:33,040
people have no idea about this how it

85
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,760
worked the medical industry and you go

86
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:38,360
to the doctor's office back boom years

87
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:42,480
ago and you had ringing in the years it

88
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:45,480
was always a diagnosis of well you have

89
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:48,080
a damaged ear because you must have

90
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:50,280
listen to loud music way too much loud

91
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,760
music before and so people are always

92
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:55,480
told that it's like loud music gave me

93
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:57,239
the the ringing the year gave me the t9s

94
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:00,319
and you know not only that the New Age

95
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:03,760
movement really really spelled out the

96
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:05,319
whole ringing in the a as as something's

97
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,640
talking to you or somebody's talking to

98
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:09,079
you or it's a message right and that

99
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:11,079
happened all the time too it's these

100
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:13,159
people would suffer from the worst ttis

101
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:15,640
and then they would go to like a psychic

102
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:18,440
and then the psychic would be like well

103
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:20,280
that's because you know things are

104
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,840
talking to you that's because fairies

105
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:23,639
are talking to you that's be you're

106
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,800
ringing in the ears because something's

107
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:28,720
talking to you or somebody's talking

108
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:30,320
about you and that happened too so it

109
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,720
was all this confus you went to the

110
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,600
regular doctor with ttis and you were

111
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,280
told you just have a damaged Year from

112
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:38,039
loud music and then you're trying to

113
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:40,120
think about when did I listen to of loud

114
00:04:38,039 --> 00:04:42,800

115
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:45,680

around Machinery did I what's going on

117
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,000

185
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:42,599
their face is congested just everything

186
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:45,400
is like every sinus cavity sinuses

187
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:46,960
everywhere completely clogged up and as

188
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:49,039
the stuff's moving in the middle of the

189
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,560
night you might hear a pop you can't

190
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:53,759
hear good and then you hear a pop right

191
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:55,879
that happens because you're sick right

192
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,120
you're sick with that flu or C or

193
00:07:55,879 --> 00:08:00,000
something like

00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,479

Thank you thank you for being here thank

you for your comment that's

198
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:13,520
awesome but if you don't have like the

199
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:15,120
flu and you know and c and whatever if

200
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:18,400
you don't have any of that and you're

201
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:22,080
getting popping or ringing or fluttering

202
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:25,520
or crackling or whoosing whoosing I

203
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:27,800
never heard whoosing described until the

204
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:30,000
medical medium books were published

205
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:33,640
never heard that and I heard somebody

206
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,320
running an ad recently on

207
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:39,200
IG and they were just like whoosing in

208
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:42,599
the a I'm like

209
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:45,240
really never heard that one before out

210
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:47,800
there when someone has the high pitch

211
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:50,600
ringing in the ear it can change alter

212
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:52,080
and dance about this is one thing that

213
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:56,480
that's really hard on tonight's

214
00:08:52,080 --> 00:09:00,120
sufferers When someone tells me aw I got

215
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:04,399
ttis okay look if first thing that comes

216
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:08,600
to my mind is the whole

217
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:10,519
dancing that whole dancing sound okay

218
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,880
because when you have tenius and that

219
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:16,600
ringing is going on all you need is

220
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:18,920
background noise like a fan going or the

221
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:22,040
refrigerator starts running do you know

222
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:24,399
about this or your laundry is running in

223
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:28,040
the back there something you got your

224
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:30,000
laundry running and it changes the tone

225
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:31,720
of the ringing now not for everybody but

226
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,360
there's a lot of cases where people and

227
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:35,760
it's changing their tone it's going like

228
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:39,279
instead of

229
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:41,399
like it's going

230
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:43,519
like it's doing this thing where it's

231
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:45,560
going crazy all over the place if some

232
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:48,279
Fan's going and air conditioning is

233
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:50,320
running if something's like happening if

234
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:52,120
there's some wind or something or you

235
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,640
got a window open and there's a plane

236
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:57,560
flying by it Alters the

237
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:59,760
tentis and if you're just laying there

238
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:01,200
in bed or laying there on the couch or

239
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,360
trying to fall asleep at night with the

240
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:06,760
ttis and the ringing what happens is

241
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:09,040
that any noise can alter the ringing and

242
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:10,640
and shift it up to the point where it

243
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,440
makes it so you can't go to sleep so you

244
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,440
actually have a difficult time falling

245
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:16,000
asleep or going to sleep that's really

246
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:18,040
hard it's like the first thing comes to

247
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
my mind is are you tortured by that

248
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:22,399
because so many people get tortured by

249
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,360
that oh my God James says oh my God yes

250
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,160
right and here's one right here that you

251
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:28,640
might not even have heard and maybe you

252
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:31,680
experienced this right Denise said that

253
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:35,160
is exact my problem yes I have that too

254
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:37,320
Vanessa whoa whoa and here's the thing

255
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:39,760
though you guys check this out this is a

256
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:41,120
big deal right here and and maybe you

257
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:44,880
experienced this maybe you didn't

258
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:46,639
experience this all right but tonius

259
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:51,399
there's a variety of

260
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:53,680
ttis okay that when the sound is going

261
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:57,279
right

262
00:10:53,680 --> 00:11:01,279
that that if there is a fan

263
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:05,560
running or an A running or something

264
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:09,959
blowing air or some noise it can alter

265
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:12,279
the ringing and turn into songs so you

266
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:14,160
actually can recognize some of the

267
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:17,399
ringing where the ringing starts to

268
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:19,519
fluctuate so much you hear music in the

269
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:21,920
ringing but yet there's no music you're

270
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:24,760
not there's no music playing nobody's

271
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:28,720
playing music but you're hearing music

272
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:29,680
within it so as it's doing that right so

273
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,680
I I don't know if you've ever

274
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,480
experienced that but that's a hard one

275
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:36,040
for a lot of people where they hear

276
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:38,680
songs within their ttis but there's no

277
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:41,040
music playing but they hear Melodies

278
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:43,399
going up and down these Melodies these

279
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,560
chains of Melodies going up and down and

280
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:47,399
songs they can recognize through the

281
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:50,920
ringing in the ear that's being altered

282
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:52,920
by a fan but yet it's not no song that's

283
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:54,839
playing there's no song that's going on

284
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:58,200
no one has the music on but you're

285
00:11:54,839 --> 00:12:01,959
hearing it and that that's just really

286
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:04,200
really bizarre how it does that Molly

287
00:12:01,959 --> 00:12:07,040
says Rell says over there on YouTube I'm

288
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:11,279

thank you aw and so s so so appreciates

293
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:26,760
that Janessa says what about air candle

294
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:30,800
burning along with the ringing okay good

295
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:33,639
question right there okay um not into

296
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:35,120
the the air you know air Canal I see

297
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:36,800
that okay not the air candle I want to

298
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,160
tell you about air candles too okay

299
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:41,320
that's something that's important was on

300
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:42,800
my mind the other day too is that makes

301
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:45,480
tonight's

302
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:49,120
worse so ear

303
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:51,680
candles actually make tenius worse I'm

304
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,279
forewarning people right there because a

305
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,279
lot of people do that well they'll

306
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:57,639
they'll burn the the candle they'll

307
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:59,440
stick it in their ear and they'll do

308
00:12:57,639 --> 00:13:04,040
that practice PR practice has been

309
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:06,120
around for a long time it worsens

310
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:08,480
tenius aggravates it because the

311
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:12,120
Labyrinth if the inner ear is so

312
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:14,480
inflamed that when you're doing that it

313
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:17,760
aggravates that inflammation that's

314
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:21,040
already hot wire don't do the air the

315
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:23,399
ear candle burning thing that's

316
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:27,040
something I wanted to you know

317
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:29,680
say um Kelly says this is mind-blowing

318
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:32,800
information I'm honored I'm glad you're

319
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:35,800
here so on the music front I want to

320
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:37,959
just cover that for another second okay

321
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,800
um that's a difficult tonight is for a

322
00:13:37,959 --> 00:13:43,120
lot of people because as they're trying

323
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:45,920
to sleep or rest they're catching those

324
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:48,000
songs and those rhythms and The Melody

325
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,120
of that rigging going into all these

326
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,639
songs and tunes that they actually can

327
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:55,920
recognize and sometimes recognize or not

328
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:57,399
sure but yet there's no music playing

329
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,040
and that one right there is difficult

330
00:13:57,399 --> 00:14:05,240
for a lot of people I don't know if

331
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:07,480
you've ever had that before you know um

332
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,759
see all right let's go let's move into

333
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:13,519
it a little

334
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:15,120
bit okay all right when someone has the

335
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,079
high pitch ringing in the ear it can

336
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,199
change alter and dance about when a fan

337
00:14:17,079 --> 00:14:20,680
or air conditioner is on and music is

338
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:22,800
playing some people experience what

339
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:27,680
sounds like air rushing through their

340
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:29,360
ear air rushing through their ear

341
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,680
like

342
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,199
then it backs down or it stays there

343
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,079
permanently it's a ttis without the

344
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:37,600
ringing so I want to cover that for a

345
00:14:35,079 --> 00:14:40,440
second do you guys know of that like do

346
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,920
do some of you have the ttis without the

347
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:46,120
ringing how about that well there's no

348
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:46,120
ringing but there's a

349
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:56,839
constant that's there all the time okay

350
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:59,040
all right some people experiencing

351
00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:01,759
popping like they're popping pop popcorn

352
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:04,759
in the ear pop tonight us can vary from

353
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:06,240
mild to extreme some people get small

354
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:08,519
moments when they hear a ringing in the

355
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,800
ear and it goes away this has been

356
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:14,240
pasted office someone's speaking about

357
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:15,880
you that's what everybody said and the

358
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,920
problem is with that one where someone

359
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:19,399
is speaking about you and you got a ring

360
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,040
in the ear and it's like someone's

361
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:23,920
talking about you the problem is with

362
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:27,959
that is that

363
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:29,199
early early sufferers of tontis in their

364
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:32,560
very early

365
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:35,560
stages who get just a

366
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:37,680
quick and it goes away it's like someone

367
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:41,440
must be talking about

368
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:44,920
me and it goes away well those people

369
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:46,440
end up hearing it more a year later like

370
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:48,240
there a little more it's like whoa

371
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:50,759
someone's talking about me again but a

372
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,560
lot more today another year later

373
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:54,279
someone's talking about me a lot this

374
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:57,560
week like twice this

375
00:15:54,279 --> 00:15:59,880
week a year goes by another year goes by

376
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:02,519
someone's talking about me like once a

377
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:05,440
day wow what's going on and then boom

378
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:08,800
they got ttis and now they're ringing

379
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:11,120
all the time it was just basically early

380
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:13,000
warnings and then finally it went into

381
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,680
chronic ttis and now they're like I

382
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:19,519
guess nobody was talking about me darn

383
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:22,199
it it was tonius all these

384
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:24,399
years what most of okay so here's

385
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:26,240
another thing too all right let's see

386
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:29,079
sometimes it takes years of intermittent

387
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:31,360
ringing in the ears to be diagnosed with

388
00:16:29,079 --> 00:16:32,720
ttis like okay here's another thing too

389
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,720
you go to the doctor like I got a ring

390
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,759
in the ears it doesn't mean you're going

391
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:38,079
to get a

392
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:40,120
ttis diagnosis at all you know I'm

393
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:43,519
reading out of the brain someone asked

394
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:45,839
just now um I'm reading out of the brain

395
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:48,839
saver book it's an Incredible

396
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:51,120
Book it'll blow your mind this book be

397
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:52,360
prepared when you get it it's so packed

398
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,560
with

399
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:58,639
information um such a great book

400
00:16:55,560 --> 00:17:01,079
life-saving life saving tool seriously

401
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:05,160
Epstein bar is the number one reason why

402
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:10,039
people have mystery tontis Epstein

403
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:13,959
bar yes EBV is the number one

404
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:18,799
reason why most people have tentis it's

405
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:23,400
epine bar getting into the ear working

406
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:25,439
its way on the nerve root hairs so the

407
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,480
nerve rout here so let's go into that a

408
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:30,960
little bit another way it does it

409
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:31,760
through neur toxins look it here I got a

410
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,640
quick

411
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:39,440
board all

412
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:42,840
right so that nerve channel in the ear

413
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:44,400
okay what happens is when a virus gets

414
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:47,080
to that nerve

415
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:49,799
Channel and it

416
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:52,919
does so when that virus gets to the

417
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:54,840
nerve Channel there you are the Epstein

418
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:57,880
bar

419
00:17:54,840 --> 00:18:00,280
EBV right when it finally gets to that

420
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:03,400
nerve Channel Channel and it gets into

421
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:05,280
those nerves and gets into the

422
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:08,240
Labyrinth right

423
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:10,159
there it clings on to it but it only

424
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:13,480
clings on to it if you got root hair

425
00:18:10,159 --> 00:18:17,360
sticking out a lot of people have frayed

426
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:19,039
nerves in their ear channels Fray nerves

427
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:22,200
little root hairs popping out you see

428
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:24,640
these root hairs and as you get older

429
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:26,840
and you're not taking care of yourself

430
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:32,000
and all the stuff's happening you get

431
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:33,559
more Fray on that nerve and that Fray

432
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,000
that's on that nerve right see the

433
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:39,799
little Fray stuff what happens is the

434
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,640
viruses look for that the Epstein bar

435
00:18:39,799 --> 00:18:46,080
looks for that it goes and it finds that

436
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:50,240
root hair coming off the

437
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:53,720
nerve sticks on there camps out makes a

438
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:56,200
home and then when it makes a home you

439
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:59,080
get a whole bunch of

440
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:02,679
inflammation in that area

441
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:04,280
now that nerve is inflamed just like

442
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:06,000
that and the whole nerve can get

443
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:11,280
inflamed it's

444
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:16,559
inflamed it ends up making noise yes it

445
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:20,120
vibrates what you're hearing are bugs in

446
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:25,360
the ear you're actually physically

447
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:28,000
hearing bugs on the nerve vibrating

448
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:30,559
because it's such a sensitive area where

449
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,000
you can hear the inflamed nerve because

450
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:36,360
of the bugs so that's what happens right

451
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,360
there move this

452
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:41,600
over

453
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:43,200
okay A lot of times too if the bug

454
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,320
doesn't get in there yet and it's

455
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:48,480
releasing a lot of neurotoxins that's

456
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:52,840
Epstein bar feeding off of mercury

457
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:55,240
aluminum copper herbicides fungicides

458
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:58,400
and whatever and fragrances when the

459
00:19:55,240 --> 00:20:00,960
epine bar is feeding off of that and

460
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:03,919
that's releasing all this

461
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:07,559
poison that poison can get in there and

462
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:11,480
inflame both ears and you got tentis in

463
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:12,440
both ears just ringing ringing ringing

464
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,880
once

465
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:17,960
neurotoxins released from the

466
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:22,760
virus they have an injuring effect on

467
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:26,120
the canal nerves nerves of the inner ear

468
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:28,320
so clear nerve that one these nerves can

469
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:30,840
swell from the neurotoxins constantly

470
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:34,000
saturating them so neurotoxins from the

471
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:35,840
viruses saturate the neres so that takes

472
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:40,039
us to this right

473
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:44,360
here okay so you got a nerve right here

474
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:44,360
nice new nerve right there it gets

475
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:49,360
inflamed

476
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:52,520
okay and neurotoxins from the viruses

477
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:54,640
that get released out of the viruses all

478
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:55,360
that poo that comes out of the viruses

479
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,679
right

480
00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:01,919
there it ends up getting on the nerves

481
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:04,200
and it just inflames it so neurotoxins

482
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:06,679
as well all

483
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:09,720
right see guys I'll show you that right

484
00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:12,520
there all right let's move on so when it

485
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:15,400
comes down to you know healing ttis

486
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:18,520
killing off the viruses is

487
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:21,440
critical that is important killing off

488
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:23,440
the viruses is critical so there's

489
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:26,240
different protocols right here so I have

490
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:28,960
protocols for that in the protocols book

491
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:31,640
here got them also in medical Med M book

492
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:34,640
one New Edition there are protocols in

493
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:37,880
here to adhere to if you adhere to them

494
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:39,880
and work with them um you can be like

495
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:43,159
thousands of others that got rid of

496
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:46,159
their tenius like gone like bye Gone

497
00:21:43,159 --> 00:21:49,400
With the Wind just that's it moved on

498
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:51,559
with their lives out of that tontis

499
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:53,880
problem okay over there on YouTube My

500
00:21:51,559 --> 00:21:55,440
vertigo is gone with medical medium

501
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:58,960
vertigo let's talk about vertigo for a

502
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:03,159
little bit too so all right most cases

503
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:05,640
of vertigo are caused by viral infection

504
00:22:03,159 --> 00:22:08,320
unless you have a serious physical

505
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:11,320
injury or you've had a concussion and so

506
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:13,440
forth like a injury exactly so most

507
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:15,360
cases of vertigo are caused by viral

508
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:19,400
infections some are caused by physical

509
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:20,840
injury or a growth or a tumor right but

510
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,120
if you're all cleared you went to the

511
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:25,080
doctor and you're all cleared of a

512
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:27,360
growth or a tumor and so forth okay and

513
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:30,080
you're all good there you did not get

514
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:31,880
into accident you didn't get to a car

515
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:34,480
accident you didn't something didn't

516
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:38,480
somebody didn't hit you you weren't you

517
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:40,880
know seriously injured then that

518
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:43,240
vertigo is

519
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:46,440
viral it's important to

520
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:48,279
know um unless you're having some crazy

521
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:50,679
side effect from a

522
00:22:48,279 --> 00:22:53,400
medication something like that you know

523
00:22:50,679 --> 00:22:55,559
like some crazy side effects but even

524
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:58,600
then you have to have a sensitive Vegas

525
00:22:55,559 --> 00:23:00,520
nerve or set of veg nerve that have to

526
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:03,919
be you know

527
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:05,840
sensitive um if no such thing exists you

528
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:08,720
weren't injured and so forth and someone

529
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:11,320
is dealing with mysterious vertigo

530
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:13,720
mystery balance problems you feel like

531
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:16,279
you're on a boat you feel dizzy you

532
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:18,320
don't feel stable or you're getting the

533
00:23:16,279 --> 00:23:21,039
whole bed spins where you're laying on

534
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:23,120
the couch or bed and it's going like

535
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:24,200
this constantly so you got that vertigo

536
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,320
where it's your you feel like your

537
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:28,279
head's moving like this you shut your

538
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:30,200
eyes and everything's moving moving

539
00:23:28,279 --> 00:23:32,360
around you know like that kind of

540
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:34,440
vertigo which is brutal so many people

541
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:36,919
suffer from that it's

542
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:38,679
awful the theory goes that if you move

543
00:23:36,919 --> 00:23:41,960
your neck or head a certain way it

544
00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:45,880
disrupts the crystals and triggers a

545
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:48,919
bout of vertigo so the medical industry

546
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:50,279
believes vertigo get this important to

547
00:23:48,919 --> 00:23:53,120
know the medical industry believes

548
00:23:50,279 --> 00:23:56,400
vertigo is some kind of inner ear

549
00:23:53,120 --> 00:24:00,080
problem that may involve crystals and

550
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:03,440
particles or stones inside the inner ear

551
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:06,159
I called BS on that many many years ago

552
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:09,720
and the industry is starting to shift

553
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:11,840
oo published First Medical meme

554
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:14,039
information but now they're saying

555
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:17,679
maners which is

556
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:20,640
vertigo man's disease may not be the

557
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:22,600
stones that were in everybody's ears

558
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,600
decade after decade after decade the

559
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:26,200
stones that nobody saw that science

560
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:28,679
never saw nobody saw them under a

561
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:32,120
microscope they didn't exist the stones

562
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:34,799
in their ears might not be it ooh viral

563
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:37,960
inflammation looks like that might be

564
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:39,480
what it is and so now it's changing

565
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:41,039
they're taking medical meme info

566
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:43,320
published first now they're saying like

567
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:46,640
maners could be

568
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:50,080
viral it is viral Theory goes on that if

569
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:52,880
you move your neck right like you go get

570
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:55,240
some help somebody works on you you move

571
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:57,760
your neck and your head just right they

572
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:59,520
try to adjust you maybe a chiropract

573
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:01,200
doors adjusting you maybe you're going

574
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:03,080
to massage therapist maybe you're going

575
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,440
to a clinic where they actually have a

576
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:07,399
system where you lay on the table they

577
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,799
lock your head in and they they try to

578
00:25:07,399 --> 00:25:11,520
give you a jolt and they try to move

579
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:13,559
your head in a certain way hopes that

580
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:15,840
your vertigo goes

581
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:18,760
away that's

582
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:20,360
scary then the the the whole theory

583
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:23,960
behind it was the crystals would

584
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:26,399
actually move so the stones in your ears

585
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:28,520
would move they try to move your head

586
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:30,559
around a certain way shake your head

587
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:31,679
around and everything they hope that the

588
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:34,399
stones

589
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:37,960
move but they don't move because they

590
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:41,320
never existed there are no stones and

591
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:43,640
crystals that get in the way that create

592
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:45,200
vertigo the real

593
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:49,240
cause

594
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:52,919
Indiana says YouTube in the podcast you

595
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:55,760
mentioned global cooling but the ice is

596
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:58,679
melting in the ocean temperature is

597
00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:01,200
rising please explain

598
00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:04,360
and much love well that's a good

599
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:06,360
question right there okay but yeah in

600
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:08,399
the podcast global cooling is what's

601
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:11,080
happening because what's going on is the

602
00:26:08,399 --> 00:26:13,799
atmosphere and this is important to know

603
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:17,480
first of all caps are melting from the

604
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:19,880
hole in the ozone okay because that's

605
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:22,960
the whole thing the ozone layer right

606
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:24,919
the atmosphere is basically dissolved on

607
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:28,600
on the opposite spectrums of the planet

608
00:26:24,919 --> 00:26:31,159
okay so it's the one reason why and the

609
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:33,080
the Chemtrails aren't saturating up

610
00:26:31,159 --> 00:26:34,559
there they're not D they're not dumping

611
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:37,559
chemtrail after chemtrail after

612
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:39,080
chemtrail over the Bergs that's really

613
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:41,919
important to know right listen to the

614
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:44,080
podcast and I'll go into more about that

615
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:46,440
too sometime so check out the podcast

616
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:47,320
episode in in medical mean podcast at

617
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,399
Apple

618
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:51,120
podcast but it's important to know

619
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:53,000
what's happening with that okay but yes

620
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:55,000
we're getting global cooling we're

621
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,760
getting poorer

622
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:02,440
crops because it is getting cooler

623
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:05,919
because the sky is filled with so much

624
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:08,960
metal that they're dropping out of

625
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:10,559
PLS the atmosphere is filled with so

626
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:13,760
much

627
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:17,200
metal that it's reflecting the

628
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:19,399
Sun and the Earth is getting cooler

629
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:22,000
because it's one of the reasons right

630
00:27:19,399 --> 00:27:24,360
there and yeah the Caps are melting

631
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,279
because they're not dumping those Trails

632
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:28,159
on the Caps they're not dumping them

633
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:31,600
there

634
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:35,159
number one plus that's where that that

635
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:38,760
hole is that's why the burgs are melting

636
00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:40,399
faster All By Design anyway we'll go

637
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:42,039
into like a deeper understanding and

638
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:44,840
I'll go into details on that but I love

639
00:27:42,039 --> 00:27:47,360
talking about that it's just

640
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:49,880
depressing all

641
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:51,919
right the real cause of most case of

642
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:54,600
vertigo is the epsteam bar virus because

643
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:56,039
epine bar creates ttis and vertigo and a

644
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:58,679
lot of people get

645
00:27:56,039 --> 00:28:01,600
both they get get both they get the

646
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:02,880
tenius and the vertigo they get them

647
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:05,880
both

648
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:07,919
together yes and if they don't have them

649
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:10,519
together in that moment they get them

650
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:13,000
later together could start out with a

651
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:15,840
vertigo Boop end up with tenius 5 years

652
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,399
later start out with tenius Boop end up

653
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:20,799
10 years later with a vertigo or a year

654
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:23,159
later they end up having both most

655
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:26,240
people end up having both because epine

656
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:28,440
bar creates a crap load of symptoms and

657
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:33,080
has disrupted people's lives in so many

658
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:36,000
ways what a really really annoying

659
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:38,880
virus

660
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:41,840
okay which area of the Vegas nerve is

661
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:43,519
inflamed affects the variety of vertigo

662
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:46,799
okay let's go into that a little bit

663
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:49,840
we'll go into Vegas nerve talk a little

664
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:52,840
bit about Vegas nerves okay

665
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,840
whoa

666
00:28:53,760 --> 00:29:01,760
see well the best we can get for now now

667
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:03,840
that's what happens when you use a wet

668
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:07,399
sponge

669
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:09,840
okay all right so you got your Vegas

670
00:29:07,399 --> 00:29:12,840
nerves yes Vegas

671
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,840
nerves

672
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:20,919
okay all right see what we got here your

673
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:22,559
Vegas nerves you got your viruses epin

674
00:29:20,919 --> 00:29:26,080
bar

675
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:29,519
virus Epstein bar virus loves the Vegas

676
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:32,519
nerves typ in the chest tightness in the

677
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:34,480
throat all kinds of different ver

678
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:37,240
versions of

679
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:40,360
gastroparesis yes Vegas

680
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:42,360
nerves that's right so you got a A lot

681
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:44,200
of people are just loaded with Epstein

682
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:45,880
bar they're loaded with different

683
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:47,799
varieties of Epstein bar they might have

684
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:50,320
two varieties of Epstein bar here's one

685
00:29:47,799 --> 00:29:52,960
variety of Epstein bar here's a second

686
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:54,960
variety of Epstein bar different strain

687
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:58,240
then they might pick up a third

688
00:29:54,960 --> 00:30:01,200
one a lot of people have more than that

689
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,840
okay different varieties of epine bar

690
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:08,840
they release different varieties of

691
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:08,840
poisons the poisons come out of the

692
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:15,279
virus and as the poisons come out of the

693
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:17,519
virus the poisons end up touching the

694
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:21,720
vagus

695
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:25,480
nerve okay the vagus nerves the poison

696
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:28,519
ends up touching the nerves the nerves

697
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:31,360
get inflamed and start to sweat

698
00:30:28,519 --> 00:30:36,200
when they start to swell vertigo

699
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:38,399
occurs the higher the inflammation on

700
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:40,399
the vagus nerves

701
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:45,080
are brain

702
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:47,960
stem cranial nerves the higher they

703
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:50,880
are more problems with your

704
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:53,559
vertigo the lower they are the vertigo

705
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:56,480
can change and be different and

706
00:30:53,559 --> 00:30:58,480
shift so a lot of people might be

707
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,320
swelling

708
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:02,360
their Vegas nerves are

709
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:07,279
swelling up

710
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:11,080
higher creating a real crappy vertigo

711
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:14,080
just downright ugly vertigo where

712
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:17,440
they're throwing up they're puking their

713
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:21,679
guts out because the vertigo is so bad

714
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:25,519
okay some people the viral poison that

715
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:27,720
comes out will inflame a lower section

716
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:31,200
of their Vegas nerves

717
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:32,799
and so their their dizziness and their

718
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,360
balance issues are going to be different

719
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:36,919
it's going to be a different type of

720
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:41,080
vertigo so I want to kind of run that

721
00:31:36,919 --> 00:31:45,600
critical information I find it's

722
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:45,600
critical I find it's critical in

723
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:52,919
information I mean I do I can't say

724
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:55,039
everybody thinks it is but I think it is

725
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:56,360
when you're suffering from vertigo and

726
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:58,360
it's like driving you crazy you can't

727
00:31:56,360 --> 00:32:00,519
drive anymore you can't do anything you

728
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:02,519
got to like you you can't live your life

729
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:03,919
the way you want to and you're living

730
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:06,480
with this constant vertigo this

731
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:09,480
dizziness this balance issue problem

732
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:14,320
it's devastating it's

733
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:18,120
devastating all right some rare cases of

734
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:22,440
vertigo can be inflammation to the brain

735
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:25,000
the brain stem higher okay mild

736
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:28,200
undiagnosed incilius or even brain

737
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:30,240
inflammation caused by a viral infection

738
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:32,919
predominantly

739
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:35,360
EBV vertigo symptoms can range from

740
00:32:32,919 --> 00:32:38,519
feeling like you're on a

741
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:40,720
boat to not feeling balanced when you're

742
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:43,080
walking to feel like you're falling

743
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:45,720
forward that's another one too you're

744
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:47,039
falling forward right that that falling

745
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:50,840
forward

746
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:53,519
thing and or you're walking sideways and

747
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:56,760
you're like walking like this

748
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:59,159
right and you're just gosh there's so

749
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:02,880
many versions that just throw

750
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:07,919
people it could become so severe that

751
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:07,919
you get what I call the bed

752
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:12,320
spins as you lie in bed the room is

753
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:14,799
spinning or rocking back and forth when

754
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:16,960
you shut your eyes you close your eyes

755
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:20,240
and the room is literally

756
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:23,600
spinning that is brutal some people live

757
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:26,120
with that every day every waking day and

758
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:28,799
sleeping day of their life it's awful

759
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:30,720
some cases of ver or severe where you're

760
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:33,039
vomiting where you get the vertigo

761
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,679
attack and you're like

762
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:38,960
vomiting

763
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:41,600
awful it's a rough one and there's and

764
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:43,519
okay so these are more acute viral

765
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:46,039
infections where someone's immune system

766
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:48,200
strength dropped and the EBV took over

767
00:33:46,039 --> 00:33:49,679
fast and now you're throwing up because

768
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:52,000
you're really tripped up you're

769
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:53,880
triggered so now you're really triggered

770
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,480
into the vomiting one you're triggered

771
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:58,880
into the bed spins it's when the viruses

772
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:01,000
all of a sudden kind of explode and they

773
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:05,120
proliferated to such a degree and so

774
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:09,159
fast and they lit that Vagas nerve

775
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:11,240
Channel up boom open the heel says I got

776
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:14,079
hospitalized for vertigo several years

777
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:16,919
back they had nothing for it they seem

778
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:18,560
to never do Margie said falling forward

779
00:34:16,919 --> 00:34:20,119
yes and to the right so you got the

780
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:22,119
falling to the right thing so it's

781
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:24,119
falling forward into to the right yeah

782
00:34:22,119 --> 00:34:25,520
that's brutal that's that's really

783
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:28,639
difficult and I'm sorry you actually

784
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:31,919
have that that's brutal

785
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:34,480
Susie Sunshine says it makes me want to

786
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:36,800
die I've heard that I've heard that

787
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:39,000
before because that's how bad it can be

788
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:41,679
where it just takes away your quality of

789
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:44,240
life and and you just feel like okay

790
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:47,280
wait a minute I'm stuck with this it's

791
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:49,839
just such a painful

792
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:53,760
situation

793
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:55,720
um okay in many cases it's not just EBV

794
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:58,599
neurotoxins inflaming the Vegas nerve

795
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:59,960
it's EBV itself so I showed you on the

796
00:34:58,599 --> 00:35:01,720
on the Whiteboard right there that it

797
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:03,720
was toxins coming from the virus

798
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:05,920
inflaming the Vegas nerves but it can

799
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:07,880
also be the EP scene bar some cases

800
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:09,599
there's different varieties of EP bar so

801
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:11,560
if you take a look at this board really

802
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:13,599
quick for a second you see one variety

803
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:15,520
of EP bar right here the red little

804
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:17,960
right red is the virus you see two

805
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:20,200
variety of of the virus right there it's

806
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:22,040
another variety you see three varieties

807
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:25,200
right here it's another variety right

808
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:27,320
there and so what happens is you can

809
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:31,079
have one variety just infl

810
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:34,880
the channel the veg nerves inflame it

811
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:36,720
another variety of epine bar actually

812
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:40,400
going on the nerve and that's an

813
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:43,680
entirely different situation so you get

814
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:46,359
another type okay so maybe you get

815
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:50,000
another version of epine bar it's a

816
00:35:46,359 --> 00:35:51,599
different strain of evv okay and that

817
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:56,480
one actually

818
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:58,720
heads to the nerves and it clings on to

819
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:01,359
the nerves and it inflames them directly

820
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:05,079
and it takes time to heal it takes time

821
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:06,079
to heal these you know it takes dis some

822
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:08,599
dis

823
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:12,040
discipline right some

824
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:14,839
compliance it takes a little time but

825
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:18,520
you can heal the one thing about medical

826
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:20,440
medum information is people have healed

827
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:21,839
it's not this whole thing does it work

828
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:24,800
does it

829
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:26,800
not no it works and that's the thing

830
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:29,920
with medical Med information this book

831
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:33,839

834
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:39,720
decade who moved out of chronic illness

835
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,960
who healed the vertigo and their ttis

836
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:42,720
and so much more that we're talking

837
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:45,079
about trigeminal neuralgia and brain fog

838
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:50,119
and everything else they healed it

839
00:36:45,079 --> 00:36:53,359
healed I mean healed gone boom symptoms

840
00:36:50,119 --> 00:36:57,040
out of the way out of here carola

841

says over there on x minus so

842
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:02,160
life-altering so few people understand

843
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:03,839
what we go through and it goes back to

844
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,319
that unless you experience it yourself

845
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:07,599
you won't know what the other person is

846
00:37:05,319 --> 00:37:08,920
going through you think they're crazy or

847
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:09,920
you think there you don't even know what

848
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:12,240

the

892
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:07,520
competitors that are coming into the

893
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:08,760

move forward amazing all right let's

904
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:39,680
talk about brain fog a little

905
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:42,599
bit let's go there severe cases of brain

906
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:42,599
fog can be

907
00:39:44,359 --> 00:39:49,760
devastating

908
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:51,200
man I mean that line doesn't cut it

909
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,720
doesn't cut it at

910
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:57,800
all severe cases of brain fog can be

911
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:59,720
devastating nope doesn't cut it

912
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:02,079
terrifyingly

913
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:03,920
devastating I should have put

914
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:06,400
terrifyingly

915
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:08,520
devastating because I've seen brain fog

916
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:11,319
cases where you can't make yourself

917
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:14,839
something to eat you can't walk

918
00:40:11,319 --> 00:40:17,839
somewhere you can't drive a car you're

919
00:40:14,839 --> 00:40:19,599
it just it creates Madness you just feel

920
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:22,079
like you're losing yourself and you're

921
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:23,480
losing hope brain fog can be oh I'm a

922
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:26,440
little foggy I'm a little foggy I need

923
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:28,359
my coffee you know use coffee to mask

924
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:30,240
your problem you're living with brain

925
00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:31,839
fog you're struggling with brain fog you

926
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:33,880
don't even really know it you have no

927
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:35,800
idea but you need coffee because you

928
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:37,520
can't function without the coffee

929
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:39,520
without the caffeine taking over and

930
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:42,599
running your adrenals and exploding your

931
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:46,560
adrenals cuz that happens so brain

932
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:49,880
Foggers are huge huge caffeine

933
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:52,760
consumers huge caffeine consumers that's

934
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:56,960
what they are and University student

935
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:59,480
brain Foggers are Aderall consumers

936
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:03,280
right they're they're medication

937
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:06,280
consumers right 80% of the colleges it's

938
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:08,800
everybody's on adol right so that's how

939
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:11,160
it works that's how brain fog is masked

940
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:16,240
brain fog is an epidemic all on its own

941
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:19,280
out there big time I mean millions

942
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:21,800
billions have brain fog

943
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:24,480
billions 50 billion people on this

944
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:27,760
planet have brain fog anybody catch that

945
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:30,240
one yet did I contradict myself at all

946
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:33,079
50 billion people have brain fog on on

947
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:34,920
planet Earth did you catch that one

948
00:41:33,079 --> 00:41:37,880
anybody going to put that one out there

949
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:39,800
see I told you he's bad look he said 50

950
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:43,319
billion people are on this planet no

951
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:47,319
it's 8 point something said

952
00:41:43,319 --> 00:41:50,200
whatever um Deborah says my brain fog is

953
00:41:47,319 --> 00:41:52,440
gone with medical medium

954
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:54,599
incredible the thing the thing is is

955
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:58,240
that coffee will

956
00:41:54,599 --> 00:42:02,240
mask the

957
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:05,520
illness and chocolate will mask the

958
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:09,560
illness and matcha tea and green tea

959
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:11,720
will mask and black tea the

960
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:15,400
illness

961
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:19,200
right and there we go Tom just said 50

962
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:22,839
billion question mark and there it

963
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:26,240
starts yeah so anyway so so many people

964
00:42:22,839 --> 00:42:27,960
have brain fog and they have to hide it

965
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:30,520
by using the caffeine but what happens

966
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:32,599
is when you do that you're creating

967
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:35,480
future brain

968
00:42:32,599 --> 00:42:37,640
fog and that really things Victoria

969
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:40,559
Rising said but what do you mean by 50

970
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:43,720
billion I am curious is it a joke or

971
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:46,960
something else could be something else

972
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:49,319
it's a joke though all

973
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:52,160
right when your adrenals are sitting

974
00:42:49,319 --> 00:42:53,960
there every single day getting beaten

975
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:59,680
down by the

976
00:42:53,960 --> 00:43:01,280
Aderall right and and in the prescribed

977
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:03,240
amphetamines and they're just the

978
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:07,480
adrenals are getting clobbered because

979
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:10,599
they're squeezing every last bit of gold

980
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:12,839
out of them so that the brain can

981
00:43:10,599 --> 00:43:15,839
override because what adrenaline is it's

982
00:43:12,839 --> 00:43:19,960
like basically fuel for the brain to

983
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:22,160
override a problem and so the brain then

984
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:23,839
kind of shakes out of the brain fog so

985
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:25,720
whatever those metals that are in there

986
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:29,839
creating brain fog toxic heavy metals

987
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:32,599
Mercury aluminum copper lead cadmium

988
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:34,000
arsenic right all those toxic heavy

989
00:43:32,599 --> 00:43:37,240
metals that are in the

990
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:40,960
brain they're creating a problem in the

991
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:44,119
brain and then you do the

992
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:45,240
caffeine and you do the amphetamines

993
00:43:44,119 --> 00:43:47,640
prescribed

994
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:50,200
amphetamines and then the adrenals just

995
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:52,280
explode right every single day like boom

996
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:54,440
I need my adrenaline fixed and then the

997
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:56,160
adrenaline shoots out and that

998
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:57,920
adrenaline is strong stuff it's

999
00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:00,040
corrosive and it goes shoots right to

1000
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:01,800
the brain and when it gets into the

1001
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:04,680
brain it lights everything on fire the

1002
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:06,200
electrical grid gets lit right up boom

1003
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:08,119
and then it overrides the toxic heavy

1004
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:10,400
metal inflammation the to the viral

1005
00:44:08,119 --> 00:44:12,040
inflammation the heavy load of toxins

1006
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:13,359
and poisons that are in the brain the

1007
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:15,480
fragrances and everything else that

1008
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:18,359
we're Poisoned With and then it moves

1009
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:20,480
that over in a way and it lights the

1010
00:44:18,359 --> 00:44:22,760
grit up so you can start shaking out of

1011
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:25,240
that brain fog but you can get brain fog

1012
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:28,040
so bad that that doesn't work anymore

1013
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:30,319
and the amphetam means and the caffeine

1014
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:32,640
doesn't shake you out of it and then

1015
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:34,240
you're just in the pit you're just

1016
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:36,720
really in the pit struggling and

1017
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:38,960
suffering and then later

1018
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:41,400
on later

1019
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:45,480
on it gets

1020
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:48,000
worse 10 years later so you were 20 and

1021
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:49,400
you're in you're in you know college and

1022
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,920
you're 20 years old and you're using all

1023
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:53,119
the amphetamin in the caffeine and

1024
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:57,839
you're pushing through pushing through

1025
00:44:53,119 --> 00:45:00,960
and you're robbing Peter to pay hey

1026
00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:03,319
Paul and then 10 years later now you're

1027
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:05,200
30 years old and you're Doctor shopping

1028
00:45:03,319 --> 00:45:06,720
everywhere for every functional medicine

1029
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:08,760
doctor you can find on the planet or

1030
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:11,240
whatever conventional doctor because you

1031
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:13,319
got brain fog that's so bad and you want

1032
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:14,760
your medications to be like adjusted and

1033
00:45:13,319 --> 00:45:16,960
you want your amphetamines to be

1034
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:19,839
adjusted and you want all

1035
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:22,680
that and it just gets worse worse from

1036
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:26,000
there and no one no one you know was

1037
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:30,520
going to be like let me help you and get

1038
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:30,520
you out of that and people just get

1039
00:45:31,079 --> 00:45:37,599
stuck talking about brain

1040
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:40,319
fog are there other planets that have 50

1041
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:44,480
billion people on

1042
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:46,319
them certainly there are bigger

1043
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:48,680
planets

1044
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:51,040
okay all right I want to go into this a

1045
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:53,280
little bit one major factor behind brain

1046
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:54,880
fog is a liver that's saturated with

1047
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:57,599
toxic heavy

1048
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:59,240
metals Ed candles air fresheners

1049
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:02,319
fragrances

1050
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:04,640
pesticides herbicides other toxins and

1051
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:07,359
so forth so a

1052
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:11,760
liver that's saturated and soaked up

1053
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:14,400
clogged stagnant sluggish

1054
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:18,680
overheated burnt out

1055
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:21,800
fatty fatty liver all burnt up and then

1056
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:24,319
boom you can have brain fog just from

1057
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:26,559
that when Epstein bar feeds on these

1058
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:30,079
poisons neurotoxins get released and

1059
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:33,839
they go to the brain so what happens

1060
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:35,040
is when viruses such as epine bar feed

1061
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:38,480
off

1062
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:39,960
of right feed off of these poisons and

1063
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:41,280
the fragrances and all the different

1064
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:43,520
chemicals and the

1065
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:45,640
herbicides and everything else right and

1066
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:48,599
the metals and they feed off of them

1067
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:50,839
those chemicals those neurotoxins now

1068
00:46:48,599 --> 00:46:52,720
being released from the viruses get into

1069
00:46:50,839 --> 00:46:54,800
the neurons and now you're just fogged

1070
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:56,800
up and your grit's

1071
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:59,440
going it's

1072
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:01,680
happening P Robinson over there on

1073
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:03,880
YouTube I have been off caffeine for

1074
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:06,720
three years my sister is quitting now

1075
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:10,000
with help from medical medium but she

1076
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:13,760
didn't want to but knew it had to be

1077
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:16,319
done it's really hard my mother would be

1078
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:19,000
on a couch would be on couch Island

1079
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:21,000
without Aderall and

1080
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:23,720
coffee yeah it's

1081
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:27,040
brutal so many people would be on couch

1082
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:30,960
Island and only there without Aderall

1083
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:33,200
and coffee I know it's not their fault

1084
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:37,040
it's not the person's fault always

1085
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:39,800
remember that always remember that it's

1086
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:42,040
not and it's not easy out there

1087
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:43,480
neurotoxins have the ability to diminish

1088
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:45,319
neurotransmitter activity and

1089
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:47,599
neurotransmitter chemicals themselves

1090
00:47:45,319 --> 00:47:49,359
meaning that when an electrical impulse

1091
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:51,319
tries to run down a neuron the

1092
00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:53,240
electrical impulse can misfire as it's

1093
00:47:51,319 --> 00:47:56,400
approaching any kind of contamination

1094
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:58,119
and inconsistent uh inconsistency see so

1095
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:00,440
what happens is that your electrical

1096
00:47:58,119 --> 00:48:02,119
Grid in your brain right all that

1097
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:04,119
electricity spinning around and going

1098
00:48:02,119 --> 00:48:05,800
through neurons all of a sudden hits all

1099
00:48:04,119 --> 00:48:08,000
those toxins and poisons and all that

1100
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:10,240
garbage and then boom diminishes and

1101
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,960
when it diminishes you your brain fog

1102
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:15,200
gets worse and by 9:00 in the morning

1103
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:17,559
you slept a good night by 9:00 in the

1104
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:20,240
morning you're brain fogged again you

1105
00:48:17,559 --> 00:48:22,640
woke up and were less brain fogged for a

1106
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:25,280
half an hour in the morning you got up

1107
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:27,880
at 7:30 8:00 in the morning you were up

1108
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:30,520
for half an hour your brain fog was not

1109
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:33,440
as bad by 10:00 in the morning it came

1110
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:35,599
on worse and worse electrical grid is

1111
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:37,720
circulating it's hitting more toxins and

1112
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:39,520
poisons after you had a good night's

1113
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:42,400
sleep it takes a few hours and then

1114
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:47,599
you're back in the saddle again into

1115
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:47,599
brain fog Nightmare and

1116
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:55,599
troubles another factor in brain fog is

1117
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:59,559
the heavy metal load inside the brain

1118
00:48:55,599 --> 00:49:02,839
brain itself Metals that's why the

1119
00:48:59,559 --> 00:49:07,040
hmds and the medical medium heavy metal

1120
00:49:02,839 --> 00:49:10,160
detox and the the advanced and the

1121
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:12,559
regular and all of that in the medical

1122
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:15,480
medium books is critical heavy metal

1123
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:18,040
detox is critical for so many people you

1124
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:20,680
can't get out of the brain fog until you

1125
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:23,960
get the metals out until you get them

1126
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:27,240
out easily and safely without any

1127
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:28,760
problems that's how you heal you get

1128
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:30,319
through brain fog and you get through

1129
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:32,960
other conditions when you take those

1130
00:49:30,319 --> 00:49:37,400
Metals out you move forward you get your

1131
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:37,400
life back that is critical

1132
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:42,559
critical

1133
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:46,200
indeed

1134
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:47,599
indeed another factor in brain fog was

1135
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:50,160
the

1136
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:53,640
metals and here's the problem like in

1137
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:55,200
the brain right here's the problem okay

1138
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:58,480
you can have Metals in one part of the

1139
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:59,839
brain tissue and then they move Metals

1140
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:04,240
actually

1141
00:49:59,839 --> 00:50:09,599
move they leech and they discard and

1142
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:12,680
they corrode and they out gas and they

1143
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:15,680
basically push out more

1144
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:17,799
metal like methyl metal off of the

1145
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:20,160
original metal itself and that metal

1146
00:50:17,799 --> 00:50:22,079
leeches like a leech field into other

1147
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:24,799
neurons and other Leo cells and then the

1148
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:28,319
brain fog gets worse and worse and if

1149
00:50:24,799 --> 00:50:30,160
it's not bought and cleaned up and no

1150
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:32,359
one's working on it and getting it out

1151
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:34,520
and getting the metals out and it ends

1152
00:50:32,359 --> 00:50:36,799
up into a bigger problem down the road

1153
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:39,359
and then down the road a bigger problem

1154
00:50:36,799 --> 00:50:39,359
and a bigger

1155
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:45,280
problem and that's how it

1156
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:48,240
rolls there's so much information in

1157
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:51,640
these books you guys you should get them

1158
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:54,440

are they're on sale right now and

1161
00:50:57,799 --> 00:51:04,119
there's protocols in these books so I

1162
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:06,359
have the

1163
00:51:04,119 --> 00:51:08,160
protocol Brain book right here with all

1164
00:51:06,359 --> 00:51:11,880
the protocols you want to get both of

1165
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:14,680
these it was one book two big the

1166
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:18,680
publisher wouldn't publish it two big

1167
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:22,680
books it became it was one massive

1168
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:26,400
book okay it's one massive

1169
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:29,200
book and then how to be

1170
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:29,200
turn into two

1171
00:51:29,319 --> 00:51:35,119
books there you go customize a protocol

1172
00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:38,200
for yourself take control over your

1173
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:39,880
health I know a lot of people they think

1174
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:41,760
okay what I'll go listen this person

1175
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:44,079
I'll go Len that person this person's

1176
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:45,559

00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:59,160
expert become your own own

1183
00:51:56,599 --> 00:52:00,880
expert that's what people need to do and

1184
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:02,960
take the book to your doctor or to your

1185
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:04,799
healthare provider and be like look can

1186
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:07,160
you help me with

1187
00:52:04,799 --> 00:52:11,520
this all

1188
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:13,760
right trigeminal neuralgia one of my

1189
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:16,280
favorites one of my favorites because

1190
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:17,520
when you heal somebody with brutal

1191
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:21,960
trigeminal

1192
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:25,319
neuralgia it is it the ultimate blessing

1193
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:28,160
it feels so good anybody struggling with

1194
00:52:25,319 --> 00:52:30,359
trinal neurology long term do not lose

1195
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:35,040
Faith do not lose

1196
00:52:30,359 --> 00:52:40,200
hope there is a way to

1197
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:42,160
heal important words you need to live by

1198
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:44,079
and have in your database your

1199
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:47,000
subconsciousness your Consciousness that

1200
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:50,760
there is a way to heal when it comes

1201
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:54,400
down to trigeminal neuralgia timeline

1202
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:57,160
right in time some people heal it fast

1203
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:59,240
some people need a few years when it's

1204
00:52:57,160 --> 00:53:02,799
brutal and they've had it too me too

1205
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:06,799
long okay trinal neuralgia is one of

1206
00:53:02,799 --> 00:53:08,240
those annoying annoying conditions very

1207
00:53:06,799 --> 00:53:10,799
annoying

1208
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:13,880
because

1209
00:53:10,799 --> 00:53:17,119
because when those nerves get inflamed

1210
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:20,680
they're in a really really sensitive

1211
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:22,640
spot real sensitive spot when they get

1212
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:25,359
inflamed

1213
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:30,079
okay so let's let's set up a set of

1214
00:53:25,359 --> 00:53:30,079
nerves here trigeminal

1215
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:38,160
nerves get a set of trigeminal nerves

1216
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:40,799
here okay here we go looks like a

1217
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:43,280
heart indeed it

1218
00:53:40,799 --> 00:53:47,200
is all

1219
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:49,240
right okay trigeminal

1220
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:51,680
neuralgia the

1221
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:56,240
shingles definitely interferes with

1222
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:58,440
these nerves greatly herpes simplex one

1223
00:53:56,240 --> 00:54:03,079
definitely interferes with these nerves

1224
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:06,040
greatly leeching out poisons and

1225
00:54:03,079 --> 00:54:08,040
toxins shingles virus a lot of people

1226
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:11,240
have different varieties I did I did a

1227
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:14,599
shingle live the other

1228
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:16,440
day okay here's little viruses

1229
00:54:14,599 --> 00:54:19,920
everywhere all

1230
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:19,920
right some are

1231
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:27,319
shingles some are it's just be one

1232
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:31,000
herpy

1233
00:54:27,319 --> 00:54:34,720
simplex and both these viruses have the

1234
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:37,599
ability to cling to the root hairs of

1235
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:42,040
the nerves so root

1236
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:44,400
hairs okay trinal nerves they root hair

1237
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:48,280
out very

1238
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:50,720
easily they do they Fray so keep that in

1239
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:53,240
mind it's why people suffer long

1240
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:54,720
term that's why they can have it so bad

1241
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:56,760
where they're getting you know they're

1242
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:59,079
getting injections in the back of their

1243
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:01,720
neck they're getting

1244
00:54:59,079 --> 00:55:03,040
injections in their jaw I mean they're

1245
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:04,640
getting all kinds of different things

1246
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:06,880
all kinds of different

1247
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:09,599
therapies and what happens is the reason

1248
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:11,799
why they suffer from it long term is

1249
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:13,599
because the root hairs coming off of

1250
00:55:11,799 --> 00:55:16,079
these

1251
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:20,079
nerves seem to be a little bit more than

1252
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:21,680
a lot of other nerves it frays easier

1253
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:23,359
that's what the trigeminal nerves do

1254
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:28,359
they Fray easier there's a lot of

1255
00:55:23,359 --> 00:55:30,920
reasons for that but um when the viruses

1256
00:55:28,359 --> 00:55:33,480
get on the trigeminal

1257
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:36,440
nerve they usually

1258
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:39,200
hit the molar

1259
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:41,640
areas

1260
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:43,280
molers those areas down in there in the

1261
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:45,559
jaw and that

1262
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:46,839
nerve so people end up getting tons of

1263
00:55:45,559 --> 00:55:50,200
rot

1264
00:55:46,839 --> 00:55:52,319
canals rot canals without needing a r

1265
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:55,160
Canal you need a rot Canal you need a

1266
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:56,880
rot Canal but people get a lot of of

1267
00:55:55,160 --> 00:56:00,599
root

1268
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:03,240
canals when they don't need a root canal

1269
00:56:00,599 --> 00:56:05,480
they get a lot of teeth drilled because

1270
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:08,480
their trigal neurologist so bad and back

1271
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:11,680
20 years ago 30 years ago was huge huge

1272
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:14,480
mess a huge mess dentists always just

1273
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:16,720
pulled teeth or drilled teeth with any

1274
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:18,280
kind of pain it didn't matter if what

1275
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:22,559
what it looked you know like in the

1276
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:25,799
digital x-rays or the pre-digital X-ray

1277
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:28,119
era the pre-digital X-ray

1278
00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:31,640
where is just like

1279
00:56:28,119 --> 00:56:34,400
radiation supersonic amounts of

1280
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:36,240
radiation not just like the digital

1281
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:38,760
where it was a little bit more it was

1282
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:39,640
it's a little bit more pinpointed and a

1283
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:41,160
little

1284
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:44,039
less

1285
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:47,400
radiation but either way what would

1286
00:56:44,039 --> 00:56:51,160
happen is if you had pain and even

1287
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:56,559
though the teeth checked out okay they

1288
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:58,520
drilled them and the 80s the 19s 90s and

1289
00:56:56,559 --> 00:57:01,680
the first decade of the

1290
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:04,359
2000s people they just were literally

1291
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:07,240
drilled drilled drilled to

1292
00:57:04,359 --> 00:57:09,200
death it's not happening as much because

1293
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:13,480
right now dentists are actually

1294
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:15,039
understanding that wait a minute and you

1295
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:16,839
know they're like wait a minute

1296
00:57:15,039 --> 00:57:20,000
something else is happening

1297
00:57:16,839 --> 00:57:23,640
here but so these nerves get highly

1298
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:23,640
inflamed they get inflamed

1299
00:57:23,799 --> 00:57:27,240
easy

1300
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:29,160

I don't know you might be interested

meme newsletter to get the announcement

1314
00:58:01,799 --> 00:58:06,400
because I'm going to be announcing it on

1315
00:58:04,599 --> 00:58:08,319
the medical mem newsletter if that makes

1316
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:09,200
any sense because that's what I'm going

1317
00:58:08,319 --> 00:58:11,400
to be

1318
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:14,880
doing all

1319
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:18,440
right trino neural just really annoying

1320
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:20,480
shingles fires many many times probably

1321
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:23,359
the

1322
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:25,760
majority and then the herpes simplex one

1323
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:28,119
a big one there too

1324
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:30,839
some people can have both they could

1325
00:58:28,119 --> 00:58:34,480
they could have the herpes virus simplex

1326
00:58:30,839 --> 00:58:37,440
one and shingles inflaming their jaws or

1327
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:40,280
their nerves but trial trigeminal nerves

1328
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:41,760
aren't just in the jaw cranial nerves

1329
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:44,440
and they can be inflamed all the way to

1330
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:48,920
the brain stem and it can be brutal

1331
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:52,200
giving people pain that is beyond

1332
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:52,200
pain like

1333
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:58,400
just terrifying pain and and so with

1334
00:58:55,599 --> 00:59:00,480
that we want to heal and people do heal

1335
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:02,160
they rid their trigeminal neurologia

1336
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:04,880
when they do medical mum information

1337
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:06,119
they learn it they learn how to heal and

1338
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:09,079
they do the

1339
00:59:06,119 --> 00:59:11,000
information if I had it I would be

1340
00:59:09,079 --> 00:59:14,680
killing off the viruses with medical be

1341
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:16,920
protocol I would be getting the metals

1342
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:19,359
out so they're not being fed because a

1343
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:22,680
lot of times herpes simplex one and the

1344
00:59:19,359 --> 00:59:25,039
shingles will feed off of those

1345
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:26,079
Metals so let's talk about Auto immune

1346
00:59:25,039 --> 00:59:28,599
for a little

1347
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:30,240
bit so what you're going to hear out

1348
00:59:28,599 --> 00:59:32,000
there is so many people being diagnosed

1349
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:33,799
of autoimmune you probably already had

1350
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,760
an autoimmune

1351
00:59:33,799 --> 00:59:38,880
diagnosis

1352
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:41,880
and pretty much everybody's going to be

1353
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:45,000
handed some form of autoimmune diagnosis

1354
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:49,599
in the coming years we're at a place now

1355
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:52,240
where everybody is getting sick even

1356
00:59:49,599 --> 00:59:55,200
when they look fine they seem fine five

1357
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:58,160
years from now they're sick it's there's

1358
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:59,920
not going to be a person left on this

1359
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:03,280
planet that is in struggling with a

1360
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:07,039
symptom at some point so autoimmune is

1361
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:09,200
going to be the big overhanging umbrella

1362
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:10,400
and I talk about that in the books so

1363
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:12,400
the first thing I just want to tell you

1364
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:14,440
about autoimmune is it's not your body's

1365
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:15,880
immune system attacking itself so it's

1366
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:17,839
not your body's immune system going

1367
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:20,680
after your organs and glands so if you

1368
01:00:17,839 --> 01:00:21,880
get Hashimoto thyroiditis you get a

1369
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:24,839
thyroid

1370
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:28,160
condition and they say it's autoimmune

1371
01:00:24,839 --> 01:00:29,799
it's not your body attacking the thyroid

1372
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:32,720
keep that in mind because it doesn't

1373
01:00:29,799 --> 01:00:35,400
help your immune system when you believe

1374
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:37,799
it has turned against you so if there's

1375
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:42,359
anything I can tell you with autoimmune

1376
01:00:37,799 --> 01:00:45,440
is you have to support your immune

1377
01:00:42,359 --> 01:00:46,880
system subconsciously consciously from

1378
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:51,280
your

1379
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:53,680
soul with your spirit with everything

1380
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:55,960
wholeheartedly have to support your

1381
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:58,200
immune system and know that it's working

1382
01:00:55,960 --> 01:01:01,000
for you and it hasn't turned against you

1383
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:04,319
and it's not giving you

1384
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:06,799
autoimmune because the system is rigged

1385
01:01:04,319 --> 01:01:09,200
so that you think your immune system has

1386
01:01:06,799 --> 01:01:10,799
failed you and yes you're out there

1387
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:13,160
working with somebody or a doctor or

1388
01:01:10,799 --> 01:01:15,319
somebody and you're trying to get your

1389
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:17,000
immune system more balanced and you're

1390
01:01:15,319 --> 01:01:18,240
doing things and you're eating better

1391
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,559
and you're doing keto or you're doing

1392
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:23,079
something else or whatever it is out

1393
01:01:19,559 --> 01:01:25,039
there and sure but if you think in the

1394
01:01:23,079 --> 01:01:27,039
back of your mind somewhere and you

1395
01:01:25,039 --> 01:01:29,039
think somewhere in your Consciousness

1396
01:01:27,039 --> 01:01:31,720
subconsciousness that your immune system

1397
01:01:29,039 --> 01:01:34,400
is causing this and you're now just

1398
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:38,720
battling your immune

1399
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:42,400
system not a way to win the

1400
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:45,000
healing it's not the way to win over the

1401
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:49,079
Beast the system is

1402
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:51,400
actually set up so we have these pot

1403
01:01:49,079 --> 01:01:53,079
holes that chip away at us and try to

1404
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:55,440
bring us down one of them is the

1405
01:01:53,079 --> 01:01:57,200
autoimmune Theory telling you that your

1406
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:59,480
body is attacking itself it's faulty

1407
01:01:57,200 --> 01:02:01,880
it's destroying itself and when that

1408
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:03,400
happens it does not support your immune

1409
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:05,119
system your your immune system needs to

1410
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:07,000
know you're on board because your immune

1411
01:02:05,119 --> 01:02:10,640
system can

1412
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:12,760
actually understand you it knows what

1413
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:15,559
you want it works with you it's

1414
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:19,920
connected to you like none other it's

1415
01:02:15,559 --> 01:02:21,440
it's a supernatural Force so your immune

1416
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:23,039
system is a

1417
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:24,920
supernatural

1418
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:28,760
force that

1419
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:31,200
can understand what you're

1420
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:34,839
thinking what you're

1421
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:34,839
saying and what you're

1422
01:02:35,279 --> 01:02:39,480

the medical meme

1455
01:04:00,319 --> 01:04:07,760
Community is the PE is is the place

1456
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:11,160
where the most sick come because they've

1457
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:12,559
tried everything else out there and they

1458
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:15,839
they didn't just come into the medical

1459
01:04:12,559 --> 01:04:17,920
medium community and buy a book or

1460
01:04:15,839 --> 01:04:20,279
whatever and or take a book out of the

1461
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:22,520
library they didn't just come in because

1462
01:04:20,279 --> 01:04:25,920
that's the first place they wanted to

1463
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:28,480
go millions of people people that have

1464
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:31,440
the books around the world they tried

1465
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:33,039
everything everything and they exhausted

1466
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:36,000
themselves

1467
01:04:33,039 --> 01:04:38,240
financially emotionally and physically

1468
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:39,680
and couldn't find the answers and so the

1469
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:41,640
people in this community really do

1470
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:43,920
struggle and they really do suffer and I

1471
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:46,240
don't lose sight of that even though I'm

1472
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:49,039
