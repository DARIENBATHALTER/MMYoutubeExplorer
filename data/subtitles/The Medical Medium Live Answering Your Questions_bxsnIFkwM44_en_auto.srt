geneva says premenstrual syndrome

17
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,360
yeah we what happens with that is

18
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,399
because 80

19
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,239
of the immune system goes to

20
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,239
your reproductive system during your

21
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,879
cycle and right before your cycle you

22
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:48,559
start

23
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,480
you start what happens with women is

24
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:52,640
their immune system starts to

25
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,079
to reduce everywhere else in the body

26
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,960
and right when you're coming on to your

27
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,239
cycle

28
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,079
the immune system goes to the

29
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:00,160
reproductive system

30
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,199
and then all this pms happens and the

31
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,359
pms could be

32
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,479
anything because anything else you're

33
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,159
struggling with

34
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:11,200
anything it comes to surface

35
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:14,640
and it comes to surface in a big way and

36
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:17,840
then it gets blamed on the woman

37
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,200
in so many ways like oh it's your pms oh

38
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,080
it's just your pms

39
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,680
your pmsing you know that's your problem

40
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,040
that's your hormones you're hormonal

41
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,720
you're just crazy

42
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,080
you know that's what they did all these

43
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,159
years they blamed it on the women it's

44
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,320
just like oh it's your pms that's what

45
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,320
it is but really that's not what it is

49
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,560
going to your reproductive system

50
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,159

51
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,759

here

79
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,599
why don't we have more help to support

80
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,239
our cycles

81
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:46,720
um well that's the thing you know it's

82
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,959
the the things that we deal with now

83
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,000
in our life in the last 100 years didn't

84
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,360
exist 200 years

85
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,640
ago didn't exist 300 years ago and what

86
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,760
people don't realize is

87
00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:01,519
chronic illness with women that's new

88
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:05,120
yeah yeah there was disease sure

89
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,519
but it but not what we have today as far

90
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,720
as

91
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:11,120
all of the path pathogen and heavy metal

92
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:14,239
toxicity based conditions

93
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,959
and other toxin based conditions and

94
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,239
we never had all this and so women are

95
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,080
up against things that

96
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,920
weren't meant they weren't meant to be

97
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,360
up against this wasn't supposed to

98
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:27,040
happen in human nature

99
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,640
but but you know evil evil evil people

100
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,440
on this planet

101
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,080
created a lot of bad situations and it

102
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,879
fell upon

103
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,480
women and men too it fell upon men too

104
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,159
but it fell upon women and

105
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,239
that's how this world's designed i mean

106
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,360
this world is can be a really dark place

107
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,480
i mean let's be

108
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:48,000
let's be straight about that i mean you

109
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,480
you gas and and murder six million jews

110
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,159
yeah

111
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,920
that think about and then genocide all

112
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,599
around this planet in different ways and

113
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,680
places and you think about that this

114
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:57,439
place is a really dark place

115
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,120
and yeah we could see the light in it

116
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:01,040
and we can see the good in it too

117
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,239
i mean the good that is here on earth

118
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,040
but wow

119
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,920
some bad stuff and from bad people and

120
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,519
so

121
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,040
and so yeah we're not supposed to have

122
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,840
all these pathogens that

123
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,599
medical research and science the private

124
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,480

125
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,320

we're not adapting though we are we are

134
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,880
we just have to use the tools to adapt

135
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,440
we have to keep on using the tools to

136
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:39,600
adapt and we can override these things

137
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,280
we can get better we could rise above it

138
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,720
absolutely so i don't want you thinking

139
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,919

216
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,440
that

217
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,080
you guys are you guys are taking

218
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:10,560
advantage of those free meditations

219
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,400
um and i'm glad you guys you guys don't

220
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,919
want me to charge for him or anything

221
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,360
because i was asking you guys i think i

222
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,280
was asking on tick tock

223
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,639
i was asking do you guys want me to

224
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,639
charge for those maybe

225
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,759
that should that should that happen or

226
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,560
it's like 500

227
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,280
for a package of meditation so this way

228
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,280
this way

229
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,880
people feel like you know they they

230
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,000
since they pay for it because that's the

231
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,680
word out there in the street

232
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,520
once you pay for something then people

233
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,240
really take it seriously

234
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:38,560
and um i don't believe that's true i

235
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,319
think that i call bs on that

236
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,240
i think if you make it free and it's a

237
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,680
quality product actually a quality

238
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,000
healing tool and practice somebody can

239
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,840
get their

240
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,199
life back i think people can recognize

241
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,240
that i know you guys do

242
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,039
um rachel brown says suggestions for

243
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,840
healing with

244
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,479
graves disease that's the epstein-barr

245
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,400
okay

246
00:07:54,479 --> 00:08:00,479
so it's it's it's in order to get better

247
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,560
it's important to in order to get better

248
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,400
it's important to know

249
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,160
like the information of why you're sick

250
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:09,759
it's one thing to have graves

251
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:12,160
but what is it um okay well

252
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,080
you know you had you had a blood test

253
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,680
the doctor says well you got a thyroid

254
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,400
problem you got graves

255
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,360
it's an autoimmune condition but where's

256
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,440
the answer

257
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,199
like i want to know where's the answer

258
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,879
so if i had graves disease i want to

259
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:27,440
know what that's going on like

260
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,960
what's wrong like what what's happening

261
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,680
does that mean my body's attacking

262
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:33,680
itself what's going wrong and

263
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,719
so that's what i would want and i would

264
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,880
want an answer

265
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,560
you get an answer and then you could

266
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,839
really heal because then you know what

267
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,320
