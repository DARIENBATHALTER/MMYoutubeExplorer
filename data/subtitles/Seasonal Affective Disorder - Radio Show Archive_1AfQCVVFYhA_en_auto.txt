[0.32 - 4.68] hello I'm Anthony William and you're
[2.72 - 7.20] listening to the medical medium radio
[4.68 - 10.56] show where each week I talk about the
[7.20 - 12.88] most advanced healing information and
[10.56 - 16.28] secrets about health much of which is
[12.88 - 18.36] not found anywhere else and is decades
[16.28 - 20.64] ahead of what's out there now as I've
[18.36 - 23.32] always said who has 10 or 20 30 years to
[20.64 - 26.64] wait for answers to their illnesses life
[23.32 - 29.52] is precious and there's no time to spare
[26.64 - 30.60] so let's get to the healing now Today's
[29.52 - 33.96] Show
[30.60 - 36.80] is about Seasonal effective disorder
[33.96 - 38.84] sad are you guys experiencing any of
[36.80 - 41.24] that do you know anybody in your family
[38.84 - 45.12] do you have any friends that say they
[41.24 - 47.72] get so you know emotional or or
[45.12 - 48.40] depressed or anxiety ridden throughout
[47.72 - 50.76] the
[48.40 - 52.56] winter do do you know anybody who's
[50.76 - 55.20] dealing with that or they feel low
[52.56 - 58.72] energy and they just there feel listless
[55.20 - 61.48] and no motivation and when fall comes
[58.72 - 63.64] around and we go into winter and you
[61.48 - 65.72] just don't want to function and aches
[63.64 - 68.60] and pains and all this other stuff that
[65.72 - 70.80] comes along with it there is some
[68.60 - 72.28] serious things going on with this whole
[70.80 - 75.80] thing and people suffer and they
[72.28 - 77.56] struggle and and they fight through this
[75.80 - 79.68] and you know fighting to survive
[77.56 - 82.76] fighting to get through the day fighting
[79.68 - 85.76] to just push through and persevere you
[82.76 - 88.64] know when that sad comes popping around
[85.76 - 91.28] and but it's it's much more than this
[88.64 - 93.08] it's much more than that so you know if
[91.28 - 95.68] I sound kind of sarcastic and I got that
[93.08 - 98.48] little funny laugh going on that's
[95.68 - 103.36] because what's out there as far as
[98.48 - 104.88] information on sad is ridiculous it's
[103.36 - 108.12] hilariously
[104.88 - 109.48] utterly you know you know silly I mean I
[108.12 - 113.20] don't even know I can't even find words
[109.48 - 114.96] it's really because it's that bad so you
[113.20 - 117.72] know they're like oh okay wait a minute
[114.96 - 119.52] you know maybe um you know when fall
[117.72 - 121.04] late fall comes in Winter and you're
[119.52 - 125.36] getting the these different symptoms
[121.04 - 127.80] that's Sab it's a real thing I'm glad at
[125.36 - 131.00] least the medical communities I'm glad
[127.80 - 134.32] at least the World Views it as something
[131.00 - 136.88] thank God we're there but that's not
[134.32 - 140.28] where it stops and that's not what it's
[136.88 - 142.32] all about it's much bigger than that and
[140.28 - 144.36] that's what we're doing today that's in

[361.36 - 366.08] and and and and more so that's a little
[363.92 - 368.56] bit about me so let's go into sad that's
[366.08 - 370.80] what we're that's what we're waiting for
[368.56 - 372.40] that's what we're here for today so
[370.80 - 375.28] Seasonal effective
[372.40 - 378.16] disorder um here's the thing about this
[375.28 - 379.48] this sad that's so important to
[378.16 - 384.12] understand
[379.48 - 388.00] sad is really just a red flag it's a
[384.12 - 390.80] sign it's a sign something else is going
[388.00 - 393.36] on that's what it is is see what we do
[390.80 - 395.52] in the medical communities today um both
[393.36 - 397.44] conventional and even some alternative I
[395.52 - 399.04] I I mean I will say that and look I love
[397.44 - 400.96] both sides I love conventional I love
[399.04 - 403.72] alternative medicine of course and
[400.96 - 406.16] everything in between and you name it
[403.72 - 409.08] but here's What's Happening Here is we
[406.16 - 412.72] we don't know what's causing
[409.08 - 414.92] something so we give it a label and a
[412.72 - 418.20] tag that's what we do give it a label in
[414.92 - 420.16] a tag like sad and we say well it's
[418.20 - 422.28] obviously happening for people in the
[420.16 - 423.60] winter so it must be the seasonal thing
[422.28 - 427.12] they start feeling better in the spring
[423.60 - 429.88] and summer so it must be that's what it
[427.12 - 432.16] must be but that's where it stops it
[429.88 - 433.60] stops right there and then if we get a
[432.16 - 436.16] little smarter we're like well maybe
[433.60 - 438.04] they need Vitamin D maybe they need
[436.16 - 441.40] Vitamin D from the Sun maybe they need
[438.04 - 445.16] supplementation of vitamin D and it kind
[441.40 - 446.60] of stops there and that's pretty much it
[445.16 - 448.40] and you know I mean sure we could go a
[446.60 - 450.08] little farther and say well maybe you
[448.40 - 453.24] know they're lacking some other things
[450.08 - 455.72] and so forth but it's it's way bigger
[453.24 - 458.40] it's way bigger than that so I want to
[455.72 - 459.84] start with the fact that sad developed
[458.40 - 461.80] where you know a lot of people were
[459.84 - 464.16] experiencing these strange symptoms
[461.80 - 466.80] during the winter and they felt better
[464.16 - 469.44] in the summer and the strange symptoms
[466.80 - 472.16] were you know the you the sadness the
[469.44 - 474.84] the loneliness the depression a little
[472.16 - 477.12] bit of anxiety some nervousness right a
[474.84 - 478.84] whole bit and that's kind of you know
[477.12 - 483.08] that kind of caught on over the years
[478.84 - 485.92] and became sad but there's just as many
[483.08 - 489.24] people experiencing that in the spring
[485.92 - 492.76] and summer too so they experience it in
[489.24 - 494.44] the spring or summer and it's also kind
[492.76 - 495.56] of random some people experience it in
[494.44 - 497.32] the spring and summer some people
[495.56 - 498.88] experience it in the winter some people
[497.32 - 501.72] experience it in the fall some people
[498.88 - 505.84] it's only in the spring it's really a
[501.72 - 507.52] hot mess what I mean a hot mess is it's
[505.84 - 509.48] it's not even labeled right it's not
[507.52 - 512.32] tagged right there's nothing going on
[509.48 - 513.88] with as far as the advancement of it it
[512.32 - 516.44] it it that's why I was saying earlier
[513.88 - 518.24] how ridiculous the whole thing is first
[516.44 - 520.24] of all there are real problems people
[518.24 - 523.12] are suffering with and dealing with
[520.24 - 525.40] there are real issues sad is real in a
[523.12 - 527.00] sense where you're not feeling good
[525.40 - 529.88] that's as real as it gets you're not
[527.00 - 532.68] feeling good and because there's just as
[529.88 - 535.00] many people getting it in the summer and
[532.68 - 537.64] then maybe they only get it one year out
[535.00 - 539.00] of three years does that mean it's sad
[537.64 - 542.04] and there's people that okay they get it
[539.00 - 543.76] every every winter but then there's
[542.04 - 547.80] different levels and
[543.76 - 550.60] severities now here's where we go wrong
[547.80 - 553.80] if it gets too severe it's not sad
[550.60 - 557.76] anymore come on so if it gets too severe
[553.80 - 561.44] it's not sad so if it's just mild it's
[557.76 - 563.16] sad you know what I'm saying you are you
[561.44 - 566.24] are you you know you're you're following
[563.16 - 569.20] me with this because so if it's more
[566.24 - 571.28] severe so the ache and pain is not just
[569.20 - 573.72] kind of feeling like oh listless and a
[571.28 - 576.60] little low energy and a little kind of
[573.72 - 578.68] achy it's you know I got bad aches and
[576.60 - 580.00] pains I got problems now all of a sudden
[578.68 - 582.68] it's not
[580.00 - 584.80] sad but but the little
[582.68 - 586.64] achiness and the little you know the
[584.80 - 590.04] little symptoms of low energy versus
[586.64 - 594.32] severe fatigue and heavy achiness is
[590.04 - 596.80] just basically the beginning or a milder
[594.32 - 599.12] version of something else that's
[596.80 - 601.48] happening but instead of like coming
[599.12 - 603.76] coming to that conclusion or or or
[601.48 - 607.80] coming to the to the you know to
[603.76 - 610.08] realization and revelational I idea of
[607.80 - 611.84] understanding that hey you're dealing
[610.08 - 613.56] with low-grade something you're dealing
[611.84 - 617.28] with mild
[613.56 - 619.40] versions mild versions of something
[617.28 - 623.32] that's bigger and in some people it gets
[619.40 - 625.12] worse and a lot of people it gets worse
[623.32 - 627.88] and I me there's people that have sad
[625.12 - 629.60] every year for 10 years where they come
[627.88 - 631.80] into the fall
[629.60 - 635.60] they come into the winter the fall of
[631.80 - 637.92] the winter and they're they're they're
[635.60 - 640.48] feeling you know depressed they're
[637.92 - 642.28] feeling achy and tired they're feeling
[640.48 - 644.64] the low energy they're feeling
[642.28 - 646.08] completely disconnected you know and
[644.64 - 647.40] they have this and then it Sparks up and
[646.08 - 648.52] they're feeling better in the spring and
[647.40 - 650.44] summer and it goes on like that for
[648.52 - 654.68] eight or 10 years and then one winter is
[650.44 - 657.84] exceptionally bad all of a sudden severe
[654.68 - 661.84] fatigue aches and pains that are crazy
[657.84 - 663.52] um real serious severe depression um all
[661.84 - 666.88] kinds of symptoms tingles and numbness
[663.52 - 668.12] everything else with it and then finally
[666.88 - 670.24] it's like now they're not what they're
[668.12 - 672.84] not in the sad category anymore what
[670.24 - 675.36] they were experiencing for eight years
[672.84 - 679.44] before it got really bad or a bad year
[675.36 - 682.44] hit was the mild versions of problems
[679.44 - 685.92] real problems real
[682.44 - 688.72] situations like forget this whole sad
[685.92 - 689.52] thing what the hell I mean we're talking
[688.72 - 692.56] like
[689.52 - 694.32] that's what I'm trying to tell you is if
[692.56 - 697.00] you're not feeling good in the
[694.32 - 699.52] winter okay that means that because it's
[697.00 - 702.76] winter because it's winter because it's
[699.52 - 704.68] fall and yes the sun isn't there and all
[702.76 - 707.84] these things that do support our health
[704.68 - 710.48] and it's freezing freezing but cold and
[707.84 - 712.76] it's just oh my God you know wind
[710.48 - 716.68] blowing and snow piled up there and a
[712.76 - 719.56] lack of light yes those are all things
[716.68 - 722.48] that don't support us as much so if we
[719.56 - 726.64] have something happening underneath it
[722.48 - 728.52] it could worsen if someone has some ra
[726.64 - 730.76] or a little bit of arthritic thing going
[728.52 - 733.08] on or arthritic thing it's going to get
[730.76 - 735.60] worse if someone has some btis
[733.08 - 737.24] inflammation of a shoulder or something
[735.60 - 740.72] which could be from a viral thing like
[737.24 - 743.40] shingles or something yes it could get
[740.72 - 747.12] worse without those you know the
[743.40 - 750.32] beautiful sun without you know without
[747.12 - 753.76] having snow piled up lack of Light
[750.32 - 756.36] freezing cold temperatures you know dry
[753.76 - 761.20] temperatures being real dry in the house
[756.36 - 764.56] all winter long and yeah your btis could
[761.20 - 764.56] act up is that
[765.40 - 771.20] sad could you know could you be feeling
[769.36 - 773.04] you know more tired because you have
[771.20 - 774.56] adrenal fatigue and and it doesn't help
[773.04 - 776.96] you're not getting any sun and adrenal
[774.56 - 779.64] fatigue gets a little worse yes is that
[776.96 - 783.72] sad that's insane
[779.64 - 785.56] it's insane to just call it sad I'm
[783.72 - 787.20] sorry and look if you guys somebody's
[785.56 - 790.20] getting mad at me right now saying I got
[787.20 - 792.92] sad that's what's he talking about look
[790.20 - 794.60] just hang in there hang in there because
[792.92 - 798.44] it's it's about getting you answers for
[794.60 - 802.44] your sad it's about getting you answers
[798.44 - 805.96] and I am not undermining or you know or
[802.44 - 809.16] or making fun of the severity of sad or
[805.96 - 812.44] sad itself I'm just letting you know
[809.16 - 815.48] that when we get tricked when we get
[812.44 - 819.44] tricked and fool into something it's
[815.48 - 822.36] worse it's worse than than you know so
[819.44 - 824.40] what that means is anybody with a
[822.36 - 826.28] symptom should be taken completely
[824.40 - 828.76] serious no matter what and it should
[826.28 - 831.28] never be thrown into sad it should be
[828.76 - 833.12] taken dead serious it should be taken
[831.28 - 835.64] really serious do you know what I'm
[833.12 - 839.00] saying like really
[835.64 - 841.32] serious no joke that means you got Got
[839.00 - 843.00] Something Brewing and it's in the middle
[841.32 - 845.76] of the winter it shouldn't be just
[843.00 - 848.84] thrown into this sad thing it should be
[845.76 - 850.92] like wow what's going on that means that
[848.84 - 854.12] when conditions aren't perfect in your
[850.92 - 856.04] life so ma'am sir when we should really
[854.12 - 858.92] look at this if conditions aren't
[856.04 - 861.76] perfect in your life you start not
[858.92 - 864.04] feeling good so something's obviously
[861.76 - 868.12] happening we shouldn't just throw some
[864.04 - 869.20] some lame label that puts it in a
[868.12 - 871.68] category
[869.20 - 876.32] that makes it not
[871.68 - 878.48] serious if you know what I mean I so so
[876.32 - 880.32] it's like okay you got some fatigue
[878.48 - 883.80] kicking on in the fall and
[880.32 - 885.64] winter and somebody else doesn't so that
[883.80 - 888.60] means you just get affected by fall and
[885.64 - 891.44] winter no your condition is getting
[888.60 - 894.36] affected by fall and winter what's going
[891.44 - 896.56] on inside your body that's already there
[894.36 - 898.84] that's not happening with someone else
[896.56 - 901.12] that's getting affected by Falling
[898.84 - 903.52] winter not fall and winter is the
[901.12 - 906.08] problem and you're just
[903.52 - 907.80] sensitive it's yeah of course you could
[906.08 - 910.12] be sensitive overall but you got there
[907.80 - 912.40] could be something else happening so
[910.12 - 914.76] look let's talk about the symptoms they
[912.40 - 916.68] can range from feeling kind of sad to
[914.76 - 919.84] severely depressed that mean suicidally
[916.68 - 922.04] depressed is really bad and you know it
[919.84 - 924.28] could be like a little bit of anxiety
[922.04 - 927.40] nervousness to severe anxiousness and
[924.28 - 929.88] severe anxiety it could be feeling a
[927.40 - 932.04] little tired when fall and late fall
[929.88 - 934.64] winter come along to feeling really
[932.04 - 937.92] fatigued where your arms are heavy your
[934.64 - 940.84] legs are heavy if a practitioner or
[937.92 - 943.52] doctor diagnoses someone who has heavy
[940.84 - 946.48] legs and heavy arms and is that fatigued
[943.52 - 949.72] in the winter and they diagnosed it as
[946.48 - 952.72] sad they should be
[949.72 - 956.56] fired they should be fired by the
[952.72 - 958.88] patient okay so because if it's in the
[956.56 - 960.48] middle of the winter you got you can't
[958.88 - 962.08] lift up your arms you can't lift you
[960.48 - 963.96] can't move your legs too good you got
[962.08 - 965.84] severe fatigue that's chronic fatigue
[963.96 - 967.52] syndrome and it's not Lyme disease
[965.84 - 969.88] that's chronic fatigue syndrome that's
[967.52 - 971.72] Epstein bar virus that is literally an
[969.88 - 974.56] Epstein bar coming on heavy in the
[971.72 - 977.20] middle of the winter and you know so
[974.56 - 978.88] it's and look you know hey could be
[977.20 - 980.96] other things too meaning like someone
[978.88 - 983.08] has you know more getting more problems
[980.96 - 985.00] in the middle of the winter they could
[983.08 - 987.44] have something else too that's Brewing
[985.00 - 989.32] no matter what so that you know the
[987.44 - 992.84] symptoms can range from
[989.32 - 995.44] feeling kind of achy to severe arthritis
[992.84 - 997.52] to feeling really arthritic or constant
[995.44 - 999.68] you know a little bit of aches and pains
[997.52 - 1002.24] to severe aches and pains if you're
[999.68 - 1004.80] dealing with some aches and pains and
[1002.24 - 1006.20] you and they come on in the winter and
[1004.80 - 1008.76] your doctor kind of doesn't know what
[1006.20 - 1010.84] they are and and blames that on sad it's
[1008.76 - 1012.96] because they don't have an answer to
[1010.84 - 1016.00] something else that's subtly there or
[1012.96 - 1018.68] missing on tests or the labs and so it's
[1016.00 - 1021.32] better just say you got sad sad needs to
[1018.68 - 1024.60] be just kicked out just kicked out gone
[1021.32 - 1026.92] someday and instead you got some
[1024.60 - 1028.80] depression you probably got something
[1026.92 - 1030.52] else like let's figure out how many
[1028.80 - 1032.68] heavy metals you have in your brain
[1030.52 - 1036.56] that's causing your depression you know
[1032.68 - 1038.24] let's figure out how toxic your liver is
[1036.56 - 1040.04] you know your liver struggling then if
[1038.24 - 1042.08] you have depression you know cuz it's
[1040.04 - 1043.56] probably got a lot of toxins if you got
[1042.08 - 1045.72] severe exes and pains then it's
[1043.56 - 1047.68] obviously there's a virus there's a
[1045.72 - 1049.28] viral issue do you have the shingles in
[1047.68 - 1050.88] the system do you have an Epstein bar do
[1049.28 - 1052.88] you have cyto magler virus do you have
[1050.88 - 1055.04] something else what happens is if if
[1052.88 - 1057.08] you're not you know if you're you know
[1055.04 - 1059.44] if you're you're stayed away from
[1057.08 - 1061.88] getting sick and you just get a little
[1059.44 - 1063.92] extra tired or lonely not lonely but a
[1061.88 - 1065.68] little lost feeling or tired or feeling
[1063.92 - 1070.12] a little bit unmotivated when winter
[1065.68 - 1073.12] comes along and you know there just just
[1070.12 - 1075.92] little tiny signs that maybe 10 years
[1073.12 - 1077.64] from now it could be even more and so
[1075.92 - 1080.28] let's nip it in the butt let's clean
[1077.64 - 1082.52] things up let's get things better and
[1080.28 - 1084.16] stronger in your health so that your sad
[1082.52 - 1086.80] isn't worsen because you know in all the
[1084.16 - 1089.76] years the decades I've been doing this
[1086.80 - 1091.80] and helping people I've seen people have
[1089.76 - 1094.48] you know symptoms of sad tell me they've
[1091.80 - 1097.96] had symptoms of sad for you know for for
[1094.48 - 1100.48] a long time okay for a good 10 years and
[1097.96 - 1103.32] then it seemed to get worse and then it
[1100.48 - 1105.04] was then it was called finally something
[1103.32 - 1106.80] else from a you a really good
[1105.04 - 1109.64] practitioner or something said you know
[1106.80 - 1111.72] what you got something else going on on
[1109.64 - 1113.16] and and what was really happening and
[1111.72 - 1115.28] I've had people tell me too what was
[1113.16 - 1117.04] really happening Anthony said for 10
[1115.28 - 1120.72] years I was just getting a little tiny
[1117.04 - 1124.88] symptoms of that I thought it was
[1120.72 - 1126.12] sad yeah and and and so we need to take
[1124.88 - 1128.56] it
[1126.12 - 1130.40] seriously if you're feeling depressed
[1128.56 - 1131.60] when that winter comes along and okay if
[1130.40 - 1134.76] you're feeling depressed when summer
[1131.60 - 1137.12] comes along you know we just have to
[1134.76 - 1139.08] know what's going on are you detoxing
[1137.12 - 1142.40] you know it's funny because when we hit
[1139.08 - 1144.60] Spring our bodies detox themselves our
[1142.40 - 1146.84] liers start to detox and if there's
[1144.60 - 1148.52] enough poison and garbage and viral
[1146.84 - 1151.16] byproduct and heavy metals and
[1148.52 - 1154.44] pesticides and Plastics sitting inside
[1151.16 - 1156.56] your liver and prescription drugs maybe
[1154.44 - 1158.32] antibiotics from you know from 30 years
[1156.56 - 1161.36] ago in your life and it's all sitting
[1158.32 - 1163.56] inside your liver and that Springtime
[1161.36 - 1165.76] comes on your liver is going to be like
[1163.56 - 1167.28] giving it a kick like kick kick it's
[1165.76 - 1169.04] going to start trying to you know it's
[1167.28 - 1171.04] going to try to start pushing some of
[1169.04 - 1174.40] that out of there pushing some of that
[1171.04 - 1176.44] out of your liver so and that stuff that
[1174.40 - 1179.24] stuff hits the bloodstream when it hits
[1176.44 - 1181.28] the bloodstream look out and that could
[1179.24 - 1182.96] be the onset of Boom um you know the
[1181.28 - 1185.44] whole Seasonal effective disorder for
[1182.96 - 1189.08] the spring and summer because that once
[1185.44 - 1191.72] that neurotoxin and the byproduct and
[1189.08 - 1194.08] pesticide byproduct and Plastics and you
[1191.72 - 1196.28] know whatever it is and you know um all
[1194.08 - 1199.04] of that radio you know Isotopes all that
[1196.28 - 1201.60] stuff that gets trapped in livers
[1199.04 - 1204.68] whatever it could be it gets in there
[1201.60 - 1206.60] when that starts kicking out then you
[1204.68 - 1208.44] know you can get you know onset of some
[1206.60 - 1210.68] depression you get onset of some anxiety
[1208.44 - 1212.92] can get onset of something and boom you
[1210.68 - 1216.04] get diagnosed with Asad for
[1212.92 - 1217.40] summer and you know it's ignored of
[1216.04 - 1220.68] what's really
[1217.40 - 1223.56] happening and in the fall you know our
[1220.68 - 1226.64] body does another systematic change in
[1223.56 - 1229.40] the fall you know our spleens tend to
[1226.64 - 1231.92] detox in the fall and spleens get filled
[1229.40 - 1233.84] up with all kinds of stuff spleens get
[1231.92 - 1236.44] really heavy they're like they become
[1233.84 - 1238.40] like little footballs and they get heavy
[1236.44 - 1241.00] and they do a little kick out in the
[1238.40 - 1242.64] fall too you know and the liver does its
[1241.00 - 1244.20] little kick out sometimes in the fall
[1242.64 - 1245.60] people are different not in everybody
[1244.20 - 1247.96] but it can kick out in the fall and
[1245.60 - 1249.32] spring what I'm saying is you know
[1247.96 - 1252.20] there's a lot of different reasons there
[1249.32 - 1254.28] another thing too is late fall is when
[1252.20 - 1256.52] sad you know comes on with with the
[1254.28 - 1257.80] majority of people it's late fall so and
[1256.52 - 1261.52] probably the majority of the people it's
[1257.80 - 1265.20] late fall fall and that's when the you
[1261.52 - 1266.60] know foods change in people's diets and
[1265.20 - 1268.28] they put a lot of you know I mean you
[1266.60 - 1270.20] got the Thanksgiving thing so you're
[1268.28 - 1272.36] doing all the Thanksgiving holiday food
[1270.20 - 1274.08] then right after Thanksgiving you got
[1272.36 - 1276.24] the whole Black Friday thing then after
[1274.08 - 1277.80] that you got whatever you got Christmas
[1276.24 - 1279.68] and the holidays and you're at work and
[1277.80 - 1280.92] you're eating cookies and then you're
[1279.68 - 1282.16] you know over your aunt's house and
[1280.92 - 1284.12] you're eating cookies and then you're
[1282.16 - 1285.80] over here and you're doing this and yeah
[1284.12 - 1288.36] it may not seem like it's a lot but it
[1285.80 - 1290.76] adds up and you might have a drink or
[1288.36 - 1293.64] two or just something else or an eggnog
[1290.76 - 1296.36] or whatever it is and you know you've
[1293.64 - 1298.32] already probably most people I mean most
[1296.36 - 1300.64] people you know who are not really
[1298.32 - 1303.28] health-minded probably already not
[1300.64 - 1304.88] eating that great anyway summer and fall
[1303.28 - 1306.28] but they're probably exercising a little
[1304.88 - 1308.60] more they're a little bit more active so
[1306.28 - 1310.52] they're keeping the poisons at Bay and
[1308.60 - 1312.92] then come late fall they get a little
[1310.52 - 1314.92] bit more sluggish because they're not as
[1312.92 - 1317.00] active they're not get you know making
[1314.92 - 1318.28] time to go walk in the park and then
[1317.00 - 1321.24] they're eating a little bit more more
[1318.28 - 1322.92] then the liver starts getting clogged up
[1321.24 - 1324.96] the bloodstream starts getting thick
[1322.92 - 1328.00] like oil and grease gets in the
[1324.96 - 1331.28] bloodstream and you know o less oxygen
[1328.00 - 1333.08] to the brain and then you start getting
[1331.28 - 1335.20] symptoms whether you're starting to get
[1333.08 - 1336.64] a little bit of viral symptoms or
[1335.20 - 1339.92] something else you start getting
[1336.64 - 1342.72] symptoms and then it's blamed on sad
[1339.92 - 1347.20] instead of everything else that's really
[1342.72 - 1349.76] happening so look I could support the
[1347.20 - 1352.28] the um diagnosis of nsad kind of
[1349.76 - 1355.44] diagnosis and I can I can you know but I
[1352.28 - 1358.24] know I could support it if it helps you
[1355.44 - 1361.40] to think it's sad I support it but what
[1358.24 - 1364.12] I'm trying to say is sad is a name for
[1361.40 - 1365.96] we don't know what's wrong with you we
[1364.12 - 1368.20] don't know why you start feeling weird
[1365.96 - 1370.04] in the spring and summer we don't know
[1368.20 - 1371.68] why you start yeah that's the the people
[1370.04 - 1373.00] who actually get the as sad in the
[1371.68 - 1376.00] spring and summer we don't know why
[1373.00 - 1379.12] you're feeling weird for going into fall
[1376.00 - 1381.92] and winter and we don't have have a clue
[1379.12 - 1385.20] that's what the label means the label
[1381.92 - 1387.64] means maybe it's the seasons because
[1385.20 - 1391.12] it's winter time and you're Fe not
[1387.64 - 1393.48] feeling so good and that's what it means
[1391.12 - 1396.48] so let's just be let's just have it on
[1393.48 - 1399.52] the table and be straight up on it
[1396.48 - 1400.84] straight honest about it because if I'm
[1399.52 - 1402.36] honest about it and we're straight up
[1400.84 - 1405.44] about it and it's just on the table
[1402.36 - 1408.44] right then you know then then you get
[1405.44 - 1411.44] better you get better you know can't it
[1408.44 - 1413.72] can't be you know you can't get snowed
[1411.44 - 1415.28] on this stuff so when the snow starts
[1413.72 - 1418.20] falling and you're getting diagnosed
[1415.28 - 1420.72] with sad you can't get snowed as well on
[1418.20 - 1423.12] that angle okay so we got to get we
[1420.72 - 1425.60] can't get tricked it's important so what
[1423.12 - 1429.36] do we do about this how do we handle it
[1425.60 - 1430.48] what do we do first of all realize
[1429.36 - 1431.92] that's you're a little bit more
[1430.48 - 1436.64] sensitive because something else is
[1431.92 - 1439.20] brewing inside so the change of season
[1436.64 - 1440.92] and the lack of things that we need like
[1439.20 - 1442.36] so going into lead fall we're not
[1440.92 - 1443.88] exercising as much we're not taking
[1442.36 - 1446.60] walks in the air we're not doing all
[1443.88 - 1450.20] kinds of things you know the cold damp
[1446.60 - 1452.88] air outside and then the dry heat air
[1450.20 - 1454.84] inside the house you know like here's an
[1452.88 - 1457.52] example which is with people who have
[1454.84 - 1459.44] sinus stuff that goes on their sinuses
[1457.52 - 1461.60] start getting worse when they're trapped
[1459.44 - 1464.88] in the house and it's you know you got
[1461.60 - 1468.68] the heat the dry heat or the forced air
[1464.88 - 1472.60] in it's winter sinuses get so bad
[1468.68 - 1474.08] I've seen diagnosis of of sad for people
[1472.60 - 1475.20] who their sinus problems start coming on
[1474.08 - 1476.76] in the winter and they say well it's got
[1475.20 - 1479.52] to be sad because it's coming on in the
[1476.76 - 1482.72] winter and it seems to only do that then
[1479.52 - 1484.28] and meaning what's really happening is
[1482.72 - 1487.12] they have other things going on in their
[1484.28 - 1488.96] sinuses mean not so bad but something's
[1487.12 - 1491.48] happening in there so that when
[1488.96 - 1493.76] conditions aren't perfect it acts up
[1491.48 - 1494.96] it's not sad there's just it's acting up
[1493.76 - 1497.36] cuz something's going in there maybe
[1494.96 - 1498.68] they got a little bit of of strap maybe
[1497.36 - 1500.60] they got some some scar tissue in their
[1498.68 - 1502.68] sinus from years ago from a sinus
[1500.60 - 1504.92] infection from 30 years ago whatever it
[1502.68 - 1509.32] is there's something else
[1504.92 - 1511.80] happening so what I like to do with with
[1509.32 - 1514.64] the whole thing if someone says hey I'm
[1511.80 - 1516.56] an sad sufferer I got sad like I'd say
[1514.64 - 1519.36] what I do is say look let's try some
[1516.56 - 1520.84] things let's get a little zinc in you
[1519.36 - 1523.16] let's get a little extra zinc to
[1520.84 - 1524.68] strengthen your immune system because
[1523.16 - 1527.80] your aches and
[1524.68 - 1529.88] pains okay we can call it sad fine we
[1527.80 - 1532.52] can call it we can call it anything we
[1529.88 - 1535.96] can call it you know you know D we can
[1532.52 - 1538.32] call it D we can call it you know re
[1535.96 - 1540.60] whatever we want to call it you know
[1538.32 - 1542.12] let's let's let's just get some more
[1540.60 - 1544.84] zinc in your system let's build that
[1542.12 - 1548.72] immune system up let's get it stronger
[1544.84 - 1551.40] and zinc is critical for sad sufferers
[1548.72 - 1554.36] critical like one of the biggest ones
[1551.40 - 1556.80] and you know I like the liquid sync sulf
[1554.36 - 1558.12] sulfate um I have that listed on my
[1556.80 - 1560.44] website if you want want to know which
[1558.12 - 1562.08] one's the right one and stuff because
[1560.44 - 1563.72] you got to get one that doesn't have
[1562.08 - 1565.20] preservatives you have to get a zinc
[1563.72 - 1567.36] that doesn't there's some zinc out there
[1565.20 - 1569.40] that are like poison when they hit your
[1567.36 - 1571.24] mouth you know um I might have told you
[1569.40 - 1573.12] this before but I've tried so many
[1571.24 - 1574.60] different supplements myself with Spirit
[1573.12 - 1575.84] meaning asking Spirit then I would you
[1574.60 - 1577.40] know would get the supplements I would
[1575.84 - 1579.84] ask spirit I would try them I would test
[1577.40 - 1582.08] them all these different things and the
[1579.84 - 1585.56] zincs that are out there they're they
[1582.08 - 1588.72] have so much citric acid in them and
[1585.56 - 1590.84] that literally it burns your mouth mouth
[1588.72 - 1592.96] in such a way that it's unbelievable so
[1590.84 - 1595.24] just be careful about like those kinds
[1592.96 - 1597.80] of zincs get the one that you know I
[1595.24 - 1601.24] recommend or one like it identically
[1597.80 - 1603.80] like it then you're good um if you like
[1601.24 - 1605.48] zinc capsules like Z zinc panate from a
[1603.80 - 1609.08] really reputable company like the ones
[1605.48 - 1611.20] that I list then then you do that um
[1609.08 - 1615.08] that could work too but I would you know
[1611.20 - 1617.72] the liquid one's always best B12 is like
[1615.08 - 1620.60] one of the godsends one of the most
[1617.72 - 1623.00] beautiful God sense of you know that we
[1620.60 - 1625.28] have on this planet is B12
[1623.00 - 1628.52] supplementation the right kind for
[1625.28 - 1630.88] knocking out sad so what is the B12
[1628.52 - 1633.56] doing what's it doing how can it you
[1630.88 - 1636.04] know get sad better you know like I
[1633.56 - 1637.88] found it to get it better well it's not
[1636.04 - 1639.48] because you know someone's just dealing
[1637.88 - 1641.64] with the Seasonal effective disorder and
[1639.48 - 1644.48] the B12 you know is fixing their
[1641.64 - 1646.12] Seasonal effective disorder it it's not
[1644.48 - 1647.92] that it's because something else is
[1646.12 - 1651.04] happening like a lot of s when you're
[1647.92 - 1652.96] dealing with depression and the Mel Mel
[1651.04 - 1656.80] colly thing the feeling lonely feeling
[1652.96 - 1658.68] lost feeling you know like like hopeless
[1656.80 - 1660.08] feeling that feelings of hopeless and it
[1658.68 - 1662.08] gets worse in the
[1660.08 - 1664.76] winter that's
[1662.08 - 1669.20] neurological see that's neurological if
[1664.76 - 1670.96] you look at most sad symptoms okay if
[1669.20 - 1673.00] you want to pop on or something one of
[1670.96 - 1675.84] the websites what you want to look up
[1673.00 - 1678.16] the sad symptoms they don't say
[1675.84 - 1681.04] neurological of course not because
[1678.16 - 1682.08] they're trying to pin these they're not
[1681.04 - 1684.00] because they don't want you thinking
[1682.08 - 1686.12] it's neurological they don't want you
[1684.00 - 1688.44] thinking your depression is neurological
[1686.12 - 1690.72] depression is neurological no matter how
[1688.44 - 1692.48] you slice the cake how you slice the pie
[1690.72 - 1694.28] whatever it is it's neurological and if
[1692.48 - 1696.60] it's depression that was set off by
[1694.28 - 1698.32] losing a loved one it's still your
[1696.60 - 1701.96] nervous system suffering from the loss
[1698.32 - 1704.52] of a loved one so even emotionally
[1701.96 - 1706.72] speaking so something terrible happens
[1704.52 - 1708.28] in somebody's life because you know we
[1706.72 - 1709.84] all we all face struggles throughout our
[1708.28 - 1711.96] life and we all have to we have to wear
[1709.84 - 1713.56] our armor and we have to be strong
[1711.96 - 1714.92] spiritually and emotionally and we have
[1713.56 - 1716.48] to you know we have to get through our
[1714.92 - 1719.24] battles and we have to push through
[1716.48 - 1721.12] everybody goes through things we all do
[1719.24 - 1722.64] and when that happens and it hits us
[1721.12 - 1725.52] hard and it really hits us hard and it
[1722.64 - 1727.32] breaks our armor down you know and slams
[1725.52 - 1729.84] us on the ground and we're hurting and
[1727.32 - 1732.80] we're flapping on the ground you know
[1729.84 - 1735.40] and um it's it's it's the nervous system
[1732.80 - 1738.24] that's getting hit we get let down when
[1735.40 - 1741.20] we get betrayed we get backstabbed by a
[1738.24 - 1743.72] partner or a friend or a lover or
[1741.20 - 1747.40] whoever or a spouse or whatever it is in
[1743.72 - 1749.60] our lives we get you know backstabbed or
[1747.40 - 1752.12] betrayed in some way or some kind of
[1749.60 - 1755.40] commun communication goes disastrous and
[1752.12 - 1758.84] breaks down that's hitting us
[1755.40 - 1761.04] neurologically it's hitting us our mind
[1758.84 - 1763.64] it's hitting our mind it's hitting our
[1761.04 - 1766.00] brain but and then if none of that's
[1763.64 - 1767.92] going on and there's none of that going
[1766.00 - 1769.88] on you don't have any of that there's
[1767.92 - 1772.04] nothing happening there like there's no
[1769.88 - 1773.56] big losses and there's no you know
[1772.04 - 1775.28] there's no betrayal and there's no
[1773.56 - 1777.52] heartbreak and there's none of all this
[1775.28 - 1779.00] stuff and but yet you're feeling that
[1777.52 - 1780.36] depression and you're feeling that
[1779.00 - 1783.64] sadness and you're feeling all these
[1780.36 - 1787.40] other things it's still neurological
[1783.64 - 1789.04] it's still central nervous system so if
[1787.40 - 1791.36] you look at symptoms and stuff they're
[1789.04 - 1792.84] not even they don't even go there if you
[1791.36 - 1794.80] find something on the Internet this why
[1792.84 - 1796.24] I always say at the beginning of the
[1794.80 - 1797.12] show you're going to you're going to
[1796.24 - 1798.76] hear about stuff here you're not going
[1797.12 - 1801.96] to hear anywhere else it just doesn't
[1798.76 - 1803.64] exist out there and so when you're
[1801.96 - 1807.12] dealing with the with with all these
[1803.64 - 1808.92] different feelings including physical
[1807.12 - 1811.12] feelings like anxiety that's
[1808.92 - 1813.32] neurological anxiousness is nervous
[1811.12 - 1816.20] system okay so it's not just depression
[1813.32 - 1818.04] it's anxiety's nervous system okay if
[1816.20 - 1819.52] you're feeling um if you're feeling
[1818.04 - 1822.92] aches and pains those are nerves that
[1819.52 - 1826.04] are hurting aches and pains are nerves
[1822.92 - 1827.56] you see and you know focus and
[1826.04 - 1831.00] concentration issues that's a big one
[1827.56 - 1832.80] with sad guess what focus is
[1831.00 - 1834.68] neurological that's
[1832.80 - 1836.64] neurotransmitters concentration that's
[1834.68 - 1837.92] neurological that's neurotransmitters
[1836.64 - 1839.28] all you need is a good dose of heavy
[1837.92 - 1841.56] metals in the brain like we talked about
[1839.28 - 1843.76] in the heavy metal detox show and you
[1841.56 - 1846.44] got focus in concentration problems
[1843.76 - 1849.36] that's nervous system that's not
[1846.44 - 1851.08] sad but that's what I mean when you look
[1849.36 - 1853.04] at all these feeling disconnected that's
[1851.08 - 1857.60] central nervous system feeling you know
[1853.04 - 1860.04] all those feelings and you know when you
[1857.60 - 1862.40] the only one that's not central nervous
[1860.04 - 1864.24] system that really is you know a symptom
[1862.40 - 1868.24] too like another symptom that we really
[1864.24 - 1870.56] deal with is weight gain and that's not
[1868.24 - 1872.12] neurological that's liver that's your
[1870.56 - 1874.12] liver getting real sluggish in the
[1872.12 - 1875.72] winter could be the foods that you've
[1874.12 - 1877.28] eaten anything like that could be the
[1875.72 - 1879.36] fact that you got a l gr viral thing in
[1877.28 - 1881.32] the liver could be um you know more
[1879.36 - 1883.16] pesticides and antibiotics stored up in
[1881.32 - 1886.28] your liver from years ago could be
[1883.16 - 1889.60] anything and and then that's what the
[1886.28 - 1891.40] weight gain you know can happen too um
[1889.60 - 1893.12] but that's not neurological that one but
[1891.40 - 1896.68] most every
[1893.12 - 1900.00] symptom with sad is central nervous
[1896.68 - 1904.36] system it's neurological so for that to
[1900.00 - 1905.88] be just taken off the table thrown away
[1904.36 - 1907.44] that in meaning why that information
[1905.88 - 1909.72] doesn't exist maybe they didn't Discover
[1907.44 - 1911.56] it yet maybe maybe I'm giving them too
[1909.72 - 1916.72] much credit they just didn't Discover it
[1911.56 - 1919.96] yet or something and you know fine but
[1916.72 - 1922.72] hey you got sad and that's the answer so
[1919.96 - 1926.84] okay so that's that's what it comes down
[1922.72 - 1928.68] to so so what can we do to battle it B12
[1926.84 - 1929.72] is like for the central nervous system
[1928.68 - 1931.56] so that's what I was talking about
[1929.72 - 1933.28] before before I ran off a little bit on
[1931.56 - 1935.00] you guys before I ran off I'm sorry
[1933.28 - 1937.80] about that
[1935.00 - 1941.64] B12 is for the central nervous system
[1937.80 - 1943.76] sad improves from every aspect of it
[1941.64 - 1946.52] from the depression from the anxiety
[1943.76 - 1947.84] from from the aches and pains from the
[1946.52 - 1949.96] fatigue
[1947.84 - 1952.76] and and hey fatigue that's neurological
[1949.96 - 1954.92] too unless it's just adrenal fatigue but
[1952.76 - 1956.36] most people who are experiencing more
[1954.92 - 1958.24] than just adrenal fatigue are
[1956.36 - 1961.00] experiencing neurological fatigue with
[1958.24 - 1964.64] the adrenal fatigue so the
[1961.00 - 1966.44] B12 is is for all of this including
[1964.64 - 1968.72] somebody who's got weight gain issues
[1966.44 - 1972.56] because the liver needs more B12 if it's
[1968.72 - 1974.52] sluggish so that's a weapon secret
[1972.56 - 1977.40] weapon so where are we now we're going
[1974.52 - 1979.68] into the winter is that what it is so
[1977.40 - 1981.72] you know this is such a that's look
[1979.68 - 1983.40] whether we're going into the summer
[1981.72 - 1985.44] whether we're going into the spring
[1983.40 - 1987.96] whether we're going into the fall it
[1985.44 - 1991.52] doesn't matter okay it doesn't matter in
[1987.96 - 1993.28] the end cuz cuz sad originated at first
[1991.52 - 1995.28] where it was just winter then for some
[1993.28 - 1998.48] reason it broadened and became exactly
[1995.28 - 2001.44] more summer but it's really anytime any
[1998.48 - 2003.28] season overall and look if you're
[2001.44 - 2005.16] somebody who it's definitely hardcore
[2003.28 - 2007.52] winter where Winter's when it happens
[2005.16 - 2008.80] and I start feeling worse then yeah but
[2007.52 - 2010.80] everybody feels it different at
[2008.80 - 2011.88] different months and different times
[2010.80 - 2014.08] different times of the year different
[2011.88 - 2016.32] times of the seasons So Different
[2014.08 - 2019.40] Seasons so it's you know so it's
[2016.32 - 2022.60] important to do the B12 that's a big one
[2019.40 - 2026.28] spirulina I love that one because
[2022.60 - 2029.76] spirina holds so many powerful nutrients
[2026.28 - 2033.80] to support it's not just about vitamin D
[2029.76 - 2036.00] believe me if if if I literally had two
[2033.80 - 2038.52] options like someone someone it say I
[2036.00 - 2041.76] didn't feel good okay and I knew what
[2038.52 - 2045.84] that was Spirit told me whatever or say
[2041.76 - 2048.44] I didn't say say whatever I mean you
[2045.84 - 2050.40] know say spirit said both these things
[2048.44 - 2052.72] say Spirit didn't want to tell me what
[2050.40 - 2054.84] what what was better for me okay so
[2052.72 - 2055.92] let's let's just say that because I know
[2054.84 - 2057.24] it's hard to say because spirit always
[2055.92 - 2058.80] tells me what's better for everybody
[2057.24 - 2060.32] what's better for me too and all that
[2058.80 - 2063.16] but say spirit said well you got two
[2060.32 - 2065.32] options here in front of you or somebody
[2063.16 - 2067.60] put two options in front of me it was
[2065.32 - 2069.52] spirulina and vitamin D they said you
[2067.60 - 2072.56] can only have one option you can only
[2069.52 - 2075.68] choose one option for you not feeling
[2072.56 - 2078.80] good and let's just label it
[2075.68 - 2080.04] sad okay um you're feeling a little this
[2078.80 - 2082.92] feeling a little that let's just label
[2080.04 - 2084.04] it sad I would go with the spirina 100%
[2082.92 - 2086.64] go with the
[2084.04 - 2089.96] spirulina because the spirulina is going
[2086.64 - 2092.32] to have so many more nutrients for real
[2089.96 - 2094.52] reasons why you have
[2092.32 - 2096.32] sad so if you're dealing with a little
[2094.52 - 2097.72] fatigue you might be experiencing a
[2096.32 - 2099.16] little bit of a viral load you might
[2097.72 - 2101.92] have some heavy metal spirina is good
[2099.16 - 2103.32] for all those if you have deficiencies
[2101.92 - 2105.16] let's just pretend sad is just
[2103.32 - 2107.24] deficiencies well spirulina outweighs
[2105.16 - 2109.12] vitamin D any day if you're going to
[2107.24 - 2111.28] take vitamin D take vitamin D3 and I
[2109.12 - 2115.24] support vitamin D3 I'm just saying
[2111.28 - 2118.36] spirulina overrides it and so there's
[2115.24 - 2122.88] things we can do that are just amazing I
[2118.36 - 2126.16] like lemon balm for sad cuz lemon balm
[2122.88 - 2128.36] is is like a nerve tonic it's not only
[2126.16 - 2130.00] antiv my role in case your sad is low
[2128.36 - 2132.32] grade Epstein bar low- grade chronic
[2130.00 - 2134.44] fatigue low grade shingles low grade
[2132.32 - 2136.68] some other kind of bug low- grade stpa
[2134.44 - 2139.00] cacus whatever it is lemon bomb is great
[2136.68 - 2141.00] because it's an anti- viral
[2139.00 - 2143.68] antibacterial it's like an
[2141.00 - 2145.48] antibiotic but I would I would you know
[2143.68 - 2149.08] I would use lemon bomb in a second
[2145.48 - 2150.84] because lemon bomb is also relaxing to
[2149.08 - 2152.56] the central nervous system and it's
[2150.84 - 2156.88] strengthens the central nervous system
[2152.56 - 2159.56] and like I said sad really is 95%
[2156.88 - 2162.64] neurological symptoms that are mild and
[2159.56 - 2165.48] some severe unless a doctor you know
[2162.64 - 2167.80] unless you go to 10 15 20 30 doctors and
[2165.48 - 2169.76] finally some doctor says hey you got
[2167.80 - 2171.28] something else going this ain't sad you
[2169.76 - 2173.80] got something you know something's
[2171.28 - 2175.72] happening here and even if that's the
[2173.80 - 2177.96] case regardless of whatever lemon bomb
[2175.72 - 2181.40] is going to be helpful for it so lemon
[2177.96 - 2185.80] bomb is another secret weapon now out of
[2181.40 - 2188.24] the foods get foods that have life to
[2185.80 - 2190.40] them in your diet you're coming into
[2188.24 - 2192.52] winter chances are you're eating a
[2190.40 - 2194.96] little differently in the summertime we
[2192.52 - 2197.72] might eat a pint of
[2194.96 - 2201.48] strawberries we might eat a pint of
[2197.72 - 2204.20] blackberries we might have more apples
[2201.48 - 2207.64] maybe in the early fall or something or
[2204.20 - 2210.04] late fall but we get into winter and we
[2207.64 - 2212.20] forget and don't realize these Foods
[2210.04 - 2214.40] disappear and these foods help protect
[2212.20 - 2217.20] us they protect our nervous system they
[2214.40 - 2218.72] keep us strong they keep us healthy so
[2217.20 - 2222.08] if you're someone that's afraid of fruit
[2218.72 - 2223.68] to begin with and you got sad or you you
[2222.08 - 2225.68] you believe you have sad or you've been

[2227.92 - 2232.56] with that but if you got sads you know
[2229.96 - 2235.92] happening then you can't keep fruit out
[2232.56 - 2238.44] of your diet 100% you can't be on a

[2238.44 - 2242.32] fruitless diet I'm not saying stop
[2241.08 - 2243.60] everything else you like and what you
[2242.32 - 2245.08] eat and all the whether it's animal
[2243.60 - 2246.96] protein or not or whatever it is I'm not
[2245.08 - 2249.96] saying that you just can't keep fruit
[2246.96 - 2253.24] completely out fruits holding that
[2249.96 - 2255.68] sunlight even if you're in it's in Dead

[2255.68 - 2261.88] was ripened in South America it was
[2259.40 - 2264.84] ripened in you know whatever Costa Rica

[2270.80 - 2278.08] wherever it was it still was harboring
[2274.48 - 2279.88] that seasonal sunlight light the power
[2278.08 - 2283.04] that's in there the minerals that were
[2279.88 - 2285.24] ignited by the sun and the whole process
[2283.04 - 2287.44] and that is helpful because it holds all
[2285.24 - 2289.84] these different nutrients and and and
[2287.44 - 2291.64] chemical uh function function nut
[2289.84 - 2293.36] nutrients and phytochemicals and stuff

[2360.92 - 2365.80] you know the nervous system you do a
[2362.88 - 2367.76] handful of walnuts handful of hemp seeds

[2385.56 - 2391.64] sad well what am I saying sad well it
[2388.96 - 2393.52] means something else is going on you
[2391.64 - 2396.00] know could be the neurological stuff
[2393.52 - 2397.88] could be the liver being sluggish and
[2396.00 - 2400.68] stag stagnant and
[2397.88 - 2404.16] toxic um you know it could be it could
[2400.68 - 2406.92] be all of that and it usually is and it
[2404.16 - 2409.92] really is so that's really important to
[2406.92 - 2411.36] know um when we're low grade viral when
[2409.92 - 2412.60] we when we have these different things
[2411.36 - 2414.12] going on in with us and we're
[2412.60 - 2416.20] chronically ill because we got the
[2414.12 - 2418.20] low-grade viral thing so say somebody
[2416.20 - 2420.12] with Hashimoto thyroiditis you guys know
[2418.20 - 2422.60] how how everything I talk about that
[2420.12 - 2424.52] we're Epstein bar causes Hashimoto that
[2422.60 - 2427.52] means the Epstein bar virus is sitting
[2424.52 - 2430.72] inside your thyroid when you have hasim
[2427.52 - 2433.00] well when winter time comes symptoms of
[2430.72 - 2435.08] you know Hashimoto can can amp up
[2433.00 - 2437.00] Hashimoto can get the thyroid can get a
[2435.08 - 2440.96] little bit worse sometimes during the
[2437.00 - 2442.60] winter and um because anything you have
[2440.96 - 2445.16] whatever that might be whether you're
[2442.60 - 2447.88] prone to UTI whether you're whether you
[2445.16 - 2451.08] have um you know gastritis intestinal
[2447.88 - 2454.80] tract disorders you know IBS they tend
[2451.08 - 2457.88] to worsen anyway under winter
[2454.80 - 2460.00] conditions everything we have regardless
[2457.88 - 2462.96] of what it is we walk around in life
[2460.00 - 2465.00] tends to worsen now sometimes when it
[2462.96 - 2467.88] worsens in the summer it's also because
[2465.00 - 2469.72] of the bad air in the summer we have um
[2467.88 - 2473.00] we have those heat waves that are filled
[2469.72 - 2475.92] with extreme amount of toxins we're
[2473.00 - 2478.12] talking loads of heavy metals in the sky
[2475.92 - 2481.36] during these humidity heat waves that
[2478.12 - 2483.56] hit that hit you know um up there in the
[2481.36 - 2485.84] north and you name it in the summertime
[2483.56 - 2489.64] where it's really humid the humidity is
[2485.84 - 2491.72] up but the air quality is down there's
[2489.64 - 2494.16] less oxygen in the air it's filled with
[2491.72 - 2496.36] tremendous amounts of toxins falling out
[2494.16 - 2498.64] of the sky you know radiation you name
[2496.36 - 2500.04] it so we get waves of that in between
[2498.64 - 2502.76] when the air gets a little better and
[2500.04 - 2506.00] nicer days happen those waves of that
[2502.76 - 2507.44] swell people up when when you have
[2506.00 - 2508.52] chronic illness going on if you're
[2507.44 - 2509.88] dealing with a little bit of chronic
[2508.52 - 2511.56] fatigue and you got a little bit of
[2509.88 - 2513.28] Edema and you got a little bit of flute
[2511.56 - 2516.04] retention and that heat wave comes on
[2513.28 - 2518.28] with that bad air you might feel it you
[2516.04 - 2519.80] might feel like the effect of it and
[2518.28 - 2521.04] have to be in the air conditioning and
[2519.80 - 2522.68] everything else because if you go
[2521.04 - 2524.68] outside you feel it and then that's
[2522.68 - 2527.20] blamed on
[2524.68 - 2528.48] sad see that's blamed on Seasonal
[2527.20 - 2530.72] effective disorder so you go to the
[2528.48 - 2533.68] doctor and you're like well in the
[2530.72 - 2535.16] summertime I I can't handle the heat I
[2533.68 - 2537.88] suffer more that's because something
[2535.16 - 2539.12] else is happening and then you know hey
[2537.88 - 2540.72] your doctor might say well you just got
[2539.12 - 2542.28] Seasonal effective disorder and then you
[2540.72 - 2544.12] start feeling depressed you can't go out
[2542.28 - 2546.60] enough you can't you know you don't feel
[2544.12 - 2548.28] that great when you're outside and
[2546.60 - 2550.28] there's there it's because of these
[2548.28 - 2552.24] different circumstances so when we're
[2550.28 - 2554.48] sensitive with all kinds of different
[2552.24 - 2556.88] issues whether it's sinuses whether it's
[2554.48 - 2558.28] UTI whether it's stomach problems
[2556.88 - 2559.84] whether it's aches and pains whether
[2558.28 - 2563.40] it's fatigue whether it's depression
[2559.84 - 2565.24] anxiety you name it they tend to worsen
[2563.40 - 2568.32] when the winter comes on and for some
[2565.24 - 2570.52] people when the summer comes on not for
[2568.32 - 2573.72] most people but a lot of people does it
[2570.52 - 2577.68] could hit and like I said even in
[2573.72 - 2579.76] between at different times too so let's
[2577.68 - 2582.60] look at other options to get rid of you
[2579.76 - 2584.04] know to get rid of what is called sad
[2582.60 - 2586.00] what is called Seasonal effective
[2584.04 - 2587.32] disorder you know to help the mood and
[2586.00 - 2589.76] everything else well you want to you
[2587.32 - 2590.60] want to do the heavy metal detox okay
[2589.76 - 2592.28] because if you're dealing with
[2590.60 - 2594.92] depression and you're dealing with
[2592.28 - 2597.32] anxiety and you're dealing with um the
[2594.92 - 2598.64] mood the mood swings and even if
[2597.32 - 2601.08] someone's giving you a diagnosis a
[2598.64 - 2603.00] bipolar which isn't it's another thing
[2601.08 - 2604.92] that they don't know what's wrong that's
[2603.00 - 2606.92] just you know a term for being up or
[2604.92 - 2609.92] down that's not a real diagnosis that's
[2606.92 - 2611.28] another label and um so if you're
[2609.92 - 2612.72] somebody that's been up and down you're
[2611.28 - 2614.92] all over the place and it's hard for you
[2612.72 - 2617.36] to focus and concentrate and you're on a
[2614.92 - 2619.96] high 1 minute not a low one minute toxic
[2617.36 - 2622.00] heavy metals and so you want to get on
[2619.96 - 2624.96] that that heavy metal detox that I talk
[2622.00 - 2626.96] about in the recent show um and you can
[2624.96 - 2629.84] go to my blog you can go to my blog and
[2626.96 - 2632.72] find the the tox the heavy metal detox
[2629.84 - 2635.76] you can go there and find it it's in the
[2632.72 - 2637.32] books but the bottom line is you getting
[2635.76 - 2639.44] these different things in you so let's
[2637.32 - 2642.76] cover a few more the lemon bomb was
[2639.44 - 2647.44] critical that's a big one even golden
[2642.76 - 2650.96] seal is good to test out for sad golden
[2647.44 - 2652.96] seal is antiviral antibacterial so if
[2650.96 - 2654.80] whatever condition you're dealing with
[2652.96 - 2656.68] and it's worsening a little come winter
[2654.80 - 2659.88] or worsening a little come summer do a
[2656.68 - 2662.36] week on golden seal um people their
[2659.88 - 2665.08] lives turn around do a week or two on
[2662.36 - 2666.64] golden seal so you know and then always
[2665.08 - 2669.40] look for the right one a whole bit like
[2666.64 - 2671.48] I said you know you know um we recommend
[2669.40 - 2674.12] the stuff that I believe is the safest
[2671.48 - 2677.80] and the best and and the body's
[2674.12 - 2680.60] friendliest and so that's one I like too
[2677.80 - 2682.68] that's a great one and there's other
[2680.60 - 2684.84] things you can do ibrite ibite is an
[2682.68 - 2687.24] herb that is incredible it's an
[2684.84 - 2690.88] antiviral antibacterial but I like
[2687.24 - 2693.20] ibrite because ibrite has um it's not
[2690.88 - 2695.12] just about being antiviral antibacterial
[2693.20 - 2696.48] it it it allows us to clean up our blood
[2695.12 - 2698.48] a little bit
[2696.48 - 2700.84] um it's kind of like a blood cleanser
[2698.48 - 2702.08] same thing with red clover red clover so
[2700.84 - 2704.76] if you go to your health food store or
[2702.08 - 2706.56] go online we have some sources too that
[2704.76 - 2708.76] we list if you go and check out the
[2706.56 - 2711.24] sources and you get red clover
[2708.76 - 2713.48] flowers and you make tea with it every
[2711.24 - 2717.04] single day all winter
[2713.48 - 2718.44] long it's going to help clean the blood
[2717.04 - 2720.40] while you're going through winter it's
[2718.44 - 2721.92] going to help keeping your blood clean
[2720.40 - 2724.96] it's a great blood
[2721.92 - 2726.52] cleanser and so what that does is it's
[2724.96 - 2731.48] helping your liver because a lot of
[2726.52 - 2733.32] people's sad is liver problems but liver
[2731.48 - 2736.24] problems that could set off neurological
[2733.32 - 2738.28] symptoms so the liver could be sluggish
[2736.24 - 2740.28] stagnant filled with heavy metals filled
[2738.28 - 2742.44] with poisons and then it's it's
[2740.28 - 2744.76] releasing into the bloodstream affecting
[2742.44 - 2746.68] the central nervous system so you want
[2744.76 - 2750.40] to clean up the blood so red clover is a
[2746.68 - 2753.12] great one too nettle Leaf is remarkable
[2750.40 - 2755.16] for sad it's anti-inflammatory it's
[2753.12 - 2757.16] incredible anti-inflammatory what
[2755.16 - 2759.24] happens is is our sad is blamed on you
[2757.16 - 2761.16] know our symptoms of sad like I was
[2759.24 - 2764.24] saying before aches and pains which is
[2761.16 - 2766.76] inflammation of the nerves is blamed on
[2764.24 - 2770.44] sad at the doctor's office you go on
[2766.76 - 2772.20] nettle leaf and it starts to calm down
[2770.44 - 2774.64] those nerves brings down the
[2772.20 - 2779.32] inflammation then you're just addressing
[2774.64 - 2781.40] the sad diagnosis turmeric turmeric tea
[2779.32 - 2783.80] you can buy turmeric and its whole form
[2781.40 - 2786.96] at all the health food stores now I like
[2783.80 - 2789.12] that simmer it in you know in a mug of
[2786.96 - 2791.04] hot water squeeze a little lemon in
[2789.12 - 2792.92] there with the turmeric throw a little
[2791.04 - 2797.00] ginger in there it's another secret
[2792.92 - 2799.08] weapon to sad whether it's summer or
[2797.00 - 2800.52] winter and you could have your turmeric
[2799.08 - 2802.68] pieces in there and they could be you
[2800.52 - 2805.08] know sitting in a hot cup of hot water

[2805.08 - 2808.52] you can simmer it making like almost
[2806.60 - 2811.36] like a sou soup and then there's the
[2808.52 - 2813.20] healing broth the healing broth we have
[2811.36 - 2814.72] the blog post on the healing broth we

[2827.56 - 2833.68] soothes the nervous system helps calm
[2830.32 - 2835.88] the liver down helps clean the blood out

[2851.72 - 2855.92] fruits and in the vegetable Department
[2854.48 - 2858.60] you know there's a lot of good veggies
[2855.92 - 2860.16] you can you can use for sad okay like I
[2858.60 - 2862.40] said before you know celery's and Herb
[2860.16 - 2864.24] that's a great one cucumbers you know
[2862.40 - 2867.00] people shy away from cucumbers all
[2864.24 - 2870.08] winter long it's the worst time to shy
[2867.00 - 2872.04] away from them bring them back in no
[2870.08 - 2873.80] matter what you know even if they're not
[2872.04 - 2876.08] that great looking at the store peel the
[2873.80 - 2878.44] skin off if you have to and bring
[2876.08 - 2881.48] cucumbers do a cucumber juice maybe
[2878.44 - 2884.64] cucumber apple juice just once a day and
[2881.48 - 2888.36] watch the sad lift watch the sadness
[2884.64 - 2889.76] lift watch things start lifting up and
[2888.36 - 2891.80] you know and so that's something to
[2889.76 - 2893.92] consider too is is just bringing in more
[2891.80 - 2896.64] cucumbers have salads with cucumbers
[2893.92 - 2898.60] avocado is really good for sad that's
[2896.64 - 2902.60] another one helps support the nervous
[2898.60 - 2904.64] system it's easy on the liver so avocado
[2902.60 - 2906.68] you bring more in you know some people
[2904.64 - 2908.12] that tell me about their C and they're
[2906.68 - 2909.60] like you know what I'm like what do you
[2908.12 - 2913.16] eat they're like I only eat oatmeal in
[2909.60 - 2916.32] the morning um you know and and then for
[2913.16 - 2918.28] lunch I have um I have chicken salad for
[2916.32 - 2920.04] lunch I'm like well we had a salad
[2918.28 - 2921.40] that's good and a chicken fine but then
[2920.04 - 2923.08] it gets you know and they say well then
[2921.40 - 2925.48] it go goes all
[2923.08 - 2928.40] downhill towards the end of the day and
[2925.48 - 2930.16] it's like cookies in the winter and I
[2928.40 - 2932.24] can't help it in 3:00 in the afternoon
[2930.16 - 2934.16] I'm having piece of cake like piece of
[2932.24 - 2935.64] pound cake or something and then it just
[2934.16 - 2938.36] starts getting worse towards the end of
[2935.64 - 2940.60] of the day and you know that's when it
[2938.36 - 2942.48] should be like handful of walnuts
[2940.60 - 2945.96] handful of hemp seeds celery sticks
[2942.48 - 2949.76] apple slices um oranges secret weapon
[2945.96 - 2952.24] sad is oranges tangerines and oranges
[2949.76 - 2954.32] these are like liquid Sunshine so if you
[2952.24 - 2955.88] juice them you know with like little
[2954.32 - 2958.40] Tangerine juice or orange juice or
[2955.88 - 2962.40] whatever think about that how the
[2958.40 - 2964.84] sunlight that's in that fruit that
[2962.40 - 2966.84] sunlight holds a lot of different
[2964.84 - 2968.80] nutrients meaning it UPS the nutrients
[2966.84 - 2971.00] in the tangerine and the orange it UPS
[2968.80 - 2973.80] it the sunlight and that sunlight
[2971.00 - 2975.52] physical sunlight that hits the orange
[2973.80 - 2979.40] and you know ripens it orange over time
[2975.52 - 2983.76] and makes it that that beautiful color
[2979.40 - 2986.48] that powerful medicine develops right
[2983.76 - 2988.56] there between the Sun hitting it and
[2986.48 - 2990.40] entering into it along with the
[2988.56 - 2991.80] phytochemicals and the tangerines and
[2990.40 - 2992.96] the oranges and the vitamin C and the
[2991.80 - 2995.08] calcium and everything else and it
[2992.96 - 2997.60] really UPS the game it can change your
[2995.08 - 3000.44] Chemistry it's amazing let's talk about
[2997.60 - 3003.72] melons melons contain highly active
[3000.44 - 3005.32] fluids that bind to poisons that cause
[3003.72 - 3006.84] sad you know the poisons I'm talking
[3005.32 - 3009.68] about like the toxic heavy metals that
[3006.84 - 3011.28] affect our nervous system um pesticides
[3009.68 - 3013.60] that old pesticides that are in our
[3011.28 - 3015.44] liver all kinds of different issues that
[3013.60 - 3018.20] affect our nervous system our liver our
[3015.44 - 3019.68] toxic blood that we can get all of it
[3018.20 - 3022.08] you know these melons they have this
[3019.68 - 3025.52] highly active fluid that's
[3022.08 - 3028.68] life-changing um mangoes mango strength
[3025.52 - 3031.84] the nervous system with their bioactive
[3028.68 - 3034.16] Trace magnesium combined with phenolic
[3031.84 - 3036.00] acids so just know that the mango has
[3034.16 - 3038.72] this bioactive Trace magnesium sitting
[3036.00 - 3042.52] inside of it with this with these
[3038.72 - 3046.64] phenolic acids combined it strongly
[3042.52 - 3049.56] supports our nervous system and and just
[3046.64 - 3051.56] as I was saying before our sad Seasonal
[3049.56 - 3054.16] effective disorder is central nervous
[3051.56 - 3056.68] system based it most of it literally
[3054.16 - 3059.52] almost every part of sad is central
[3056.68 - 3062.08] nervous system based papaya incredible
[3059.52 - 3064.48] for sad because by far it's one of the
[3062.08 - 3067.40] most powerful gut restoratives and our
[3064.48 - 3071.60] guts are tied to our nervous systems so
[3067.40 - 3073.52] papayas are that powerful see the papaya
[3071.60 - 3077.12] has not only this digestive enzyme thing
[3073.52 - 3080.92] going on it's got 500 over 500
[3077.12 - 3082.88] undiscovered enzymes in papaya they're
[3080.92 - 3085.00] incredible for our guts and our guts are
[3082.88 - 3087.36] so wired to the nervous system so think
[3085.00 - 3089.80] about bringing in some of these Foods in
[3087.36 - 3092.72] any way you can a half a papaya here and
[3089.80 - 3096.12] there maybe you could find a good mango
[3092.72 - 3098.16] get a tangerine in there and literally
[3096.12 - 3100.80] this could be lifechanging and will be
[3098.16 - 3103.24] lifechanging so do it when you can take
[3100.80 - 3107.28] one day at a time even if you just bring
[3103.24 - 3110.04] in one food a day so one food a day one
[3107.28 - 3112.36] food every other day you know one food
[3110.04 - 3115.56] hey look if all you can do is bring in
[3112.36 - 3117.64] one food a week it can help it really
[3115.56 - 3121.60] can't even if it's subtle even if it's
[3117.64 - 3124.76] just mildly there you know a little bit
[3121.60 - 3128.72] help it matters because your body will
[3124.76 - 3130.72] actually use that food it'll use it for
[3128.72 - 3132.04] you even if you don't feel the effect
[3130.72 - 3133.80] yet but if you can get it every day then
[3132.04 - 3134.88] you'll feel the effects faster of course
[3133.80 - 3138.40] because your body's going to be able to
[3134.88 - 3140.24] get more of it and that matters and you
[3138.40 - 3142.52] know all these things make a difference
[3140.24 - 3144.96] to build up you know build up your
[3142.52 - 3148.04] immune system build up your neurological
[3144.96 - 3150.44] system build up your liver and get you
[3148.04 - 3153.56] out of this
[3150.44 - 3157.80] diagnosis and also protect you so that
[3153.56 - 3160.40] your sad doesn't get worse down the road
[3157.80 - 3162.80] and develop into more Depression more
[3160.40 - 3164.44] anxiety you know and and all these other
[3162.80 - 3166.76] different symptoms along with it more ex
[3164.44 - 3169.20] and pains more fatigue you name it let's
[3166.76 - 3172.36] not go there let's let's head it off at
[3169.20 - 3173.92] the past Lord knows enough people have
[3172.36 - 3175.76] enough symptoms and they can't even get
[3173.92 - 3176.96] out of bed you guys know know I know
[3175.76 - 3178.56] many of you are dealing with it and
[3176.96 - 3181.44] can't function and you you know it's
[3178.56 - 3184.08] enough of that's going on so let's all
[3181.44 - 3185.76] work on getting better and moving to the
[3184.08 - 3189.04] right direction moving to the right
[3185.76 - 3192.88] place with all of this so the bottom
[3189.04 - 3196.16] line is realize hey you know let's not
[3192.88 - 3199.60] get tricked let's not get fooled about
[3196.16 - 3202.40] the labels were handed so much let's get
[3199.60 - 3204.76] down to the bottom of what's going on
[3202.40 - 3206.28] what's really happening you know what's
[3204.76 - 3208.20] the deal
[3206.28 - 3209.92] and that's the direction we need to go
[3208.20 - 3211.20] that's the key so I would just
[3209.92 - 3213.48] incorporate some of these different
[3211.20 - 3216.00] supplements bring in some of the foods
[3213.48 - 3218.64] without a doubt if you know somebody
[3216.00 - 3220.80] going through this you know offer them
[3218.64 - 3223.28] some of these options it could be really
[3220.80 - 3225.92] helpful really life-changing and make a
[3223.28 - 3227.52] big difference in their life you know I
