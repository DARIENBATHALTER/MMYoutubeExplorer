[207.68 - 211.68] about eggs a little bit
[209.44 - 213.28] because can't get enough of it there's a
[211.68 - 214.96] lot of confusion people say well if you
[213.28 - 216.56] cook the egg
[214.96 - 218.08] if you cook the egg then you don't have
[216.56 - 218.96] to worry you can eat all the eggs you
[218.08 - 222.32] want
[218.96 - 225.44] no that's not how it works cooked raw
[222.32 - 226.64] the bacteria the viruses they're not in
[225.44 - 228.72] the egg
[226.64 - 230.00] they're not in this egg no they're not
[228.72 - 233.12] in the eggs
[230.00 - 234.96] they're not see they raise pathogens in
[233.12 - 237.12] the egg they take the top off the egg
[234.96 - 238.96] like in the video on tick-tock they take
[237.12 - 242.08] the top off the egg
[238.96 - 244.16] and they and they they place
[242.08 - 245.12] the pathogen inside the egg they grow it
[244.16 - 246.64] and so forth that's what they've been
[245.12 - 249.84] doing for 100 years right
[246.64 - 252.48] but when you eat the egg you feed your
[249.84 - 254.32] epstein bar you feed people are like
[252.48 - 255.68] reactivated epstein-barr my doctor's
[254.32 - 257.20] looking for reactivated epstein-barr
[255.68 - 258.48] yeah medical medium information that's
[257.20 - 259.12] the only reason why they're looking for
[258.48 - 262.72] it right
[259.12 - 265.84] but what they don't know details matter
[262.72 - 267.20] details matter when you eat the egg you
[265.84 - 269.52] feed the epstein bar barr
[267.20 - 270.64] epstein-barr gets re-activated we'll
[269.52 - 272.56] talk about that a little bit
[270.64 - 275.24] lorraine oh my god egg confusion is

[660.00 - 664.72] didn't want to let it go
[662.08 - 665.76] so you mean okay so my life before this
[664.72 - 667.68] lifetime
[665.76 - 669.44] i was really sick is that what you're
[667.68 - 671.12] saying okay
[669.44 - 672.80] and i just didn't want to let it go
[671.12 - 676.00] right i wanted to stay sick
[672.80 - 679.44] so i brought it into this next lifetime
[676.00 - 683.52] wow i was also the queen of england
[679.44 - 687.52] in 1342 and i had my head chopped off
[683.52 - 690.00] and that's why my neck hurts um
[687.52 - 691.68] that whoa wait a minute i was queen
[690.00 - 694.64] victoria
[691.68 - 695.44] is that what it was i was queen victoria
[694.64 - 699.20] okay and
[695.44 - 701.28] okay i gotta hang up now thank you
[699.20 - 704.00] have you guys ever heard that one right
[701.28 - 704.88] have you linda blood draws show what our
[704.00 - 706.96] bodies are
[704.88 - 709.60] doing yeah it's great it gives the
[706.96 - 712.72] doctor who doesn't know why you're sick
[709.60 - 713.84] a window into hopefully guessing more to
[712.72 - 715.84] what's going on
[713.84 - 716.88] because that's how it works people with
[715.84 - 718.80] chronic illness
[716.88 - 720.16] they go they go they go they go they go
[718.80 - 720.64] to the doctor they don't know what's
[720.16 - 722.16] wrong
[720.64 - 723.68] they have all the dizziness tingles
[722.16 - 725.04] numbness chest tightness and now they're
[723.68 - 726.00] going to a specialist another
[725.04 - 727.60] neurologist
[726.00 - 729.12] and they get all this blood taken right
[727.60 - 731.28] linda totally
[729.12 - 733.12] and yeah to try to get a window and i
[731.28 - 734.64] believe in blood tests i want people to
[733.12 - 736.56] go get a blood test but there's a way to
[734.64 - 737.92] do it that can protect you and save your
[736.56 - 739.68] life because they take
[737.92 - 741.52] too much blood and you lose your immune
[739.68 - 743.04] system listen to the episode linda
[741.52 - 744.96] that's what you should do right there
[743.04 - 747.12] it's important so
[744.96 - 748.32] when they take your blood you lose your
[747.12 - 751.44] cbc
[748.32 - 751.92] cbc you were good to me now you're going
[751.44 - 754.48] off
[751.92 - 756.00] bye bye you know you know that's how it
[754.48 - 758.00] works because they take your your
[756.00 - 760.40] complete blood count right a piece of
[758.00 - 761.52] it a piece of it you lose your white
[760.40 - 764.32] blood cells they take
[761.52 - 765.76] 20 vials 30 vials they'll take 24 vials
[764.32 - 767.92] they'll take 14 vials
[765.76 - 769.68] and you just lose lose lose and the
[767.92 - 772.32] whole 7 vials
[769.68 - 773.44] 5 full vials but complete vials right
[772.32 - 775.84] full vials
[773.44 - 777.76] and we lose our immune system and it
[775.84 - 778.40] takes months to get our immune system
[777.76 - 780.96] back but
[778.40 - 781.52] while that's happening a little buggy is
[780.96 - 784.16] coming up
[781.52 - 785.28] reactivated epstein-barr that now signs
[784.16 - 787.36] research takes
[785.28 - 789.44] by information and they're using it now
[787.36 - 792.16] right i published it first
[789.44 - 793.28] but anyway reactivated epstein-barr and
[792.16 - 795.52] what happens is
[793.28 - 796.96] that reactivated epstein-barr comes out
[795.52 - 797.28] because you're losing your immune system
[796.96 - 799.36] from
[797.28 - 800.88] all the blood draws right and then in
[799.36 - 802.48] the end sure
[800.88 - 804.08] the doctor might see something in your
[802.48 - 807.12] blood draw but
[804.08 - 810.32] also when they keep on taking blood
[807.12 - 811.20] they keep on making you deficient so now
[810.32 - 814.72] it's like
[811.20 - 816.88] if now it's like this whole thing really
[814.72 - 819.68] the last blood test i had i'm more
[816.88 - 821.76] deficient than i was before
[819.68 - 823.36] my my nutritional my nutritional
[821.76 - 826.56] profiles worse
[823.36 - 828.40] why is that huh i got to start eating
[826.56 - 830.16] better i am eating better
[828.40 - 832.32] what it is is they start removing
[830.16 - 835.60] everything from you from all that
[832.32 - 838.24] deb scott surprised to find find you
[835.60 - 841.44] making fun of spiritual advisors
[838.24 - 843.28] and all that airy fairy stuff you know
[841.44 - 846.16] like when spirit told you to tell your
[843.28 - 849.04] grandmother she had lung cancer i think
[846.16 - 849.52] we've been duped you come a long way you
[849.04 - 851.68] know
[849.52 - 853.60] deb what happens with me okay just so
[851.68 - 856.72] you know is i've had to undo
[853.60 - 860.00] a lot of spiritually damaged
[856.72 - 862.40] people through 35 years of work okay
[860.00 - 863.84] so people who are chronically ill and
[862.40 - 866.56] really sick
[863.84 - 867.20] come pouring into my office okay
[866.56 - 869.36] including
[867.20 - 871.04] patients that doctors would send right
[869.36 - 875.04] pouring into my office
[871.04 - 876.72] and people were so mind damaged
[875.04 - 878.56] they were told they had a fear of
[876.72 - 879.28] healing they were told they manifested
[878.56 - 881.84] their sickness
[879.28 - 883.04] can you imagine you're being told that
[881.84 - 886.08] so i created it
[883.04 - 888.08] like i created my sickness and then they
[886.08 - 890.16] they do that right they've also told
[888.08 - 893.28] people it's all because you didn't
[890.16 - 894.72] solve something in a past life right so
[893.28 - 897.92] that's another thing too
[894.72 - 899.04] i've had people just so head screwed so
[897.92 - 902.80] duped
[899.04 - 903.92] so fooled okay and we're really hurt and
[902.80 - 905.84] bad because of it
[903.92 - 907.20] because if yeah i'm not saying spiritual
[905.84 - 909.28] advisors are bad
[907.20 - 911.20] i'm just saying i've seen some damaged
[909.28 - 914.24] people being told
[911.20 - 914.96] some crazy stuff and they walked into my
[914.24 - 917.12] office
[914.96 - 919.20] and guess what spirit of compassion did
[917.12 - 921.60] told them what was wrong
[919.20 - 923.20] so their doctor can help them uh spirit
[921.60 - 925.60] of compassion didn't say
[923.20 - 928.24] that they had their they were beheaded
[925.60 - 930.08] okay in 1645
[928.24 - 932.24] the spirit of compassion didn't say they
[930.08 - 933.12] manifested it spirit of compassion never
[932.24 - 935.20] said to anyone you
[933.12 - 937.44] created it spirit of compassion never
[935.20 - 939.68] said you got a fear of healing
[937.44 - 941.76] and spirit of compassion never said your
[939.68 - 942.56] body is attacking itself like medical
[941.76 - 944.08] science
[942.56 - 945.92] and they never said anything else like
[944.08 - 946.88] that he never said anything else like
[945.92 - 949.60] that but they
[946.88 - 951.28] always tell people that it's your body
[949.60 - 953.92] attacking itself that's what they say
[951.28 - 954.32] so what that's the difference right
[953.92 - 956.64] there
[954.32 - 957.60] and i have respect for any spiritual
[956.64 - 959.12] advisor
[957.60 - 961.60] even when they're making massive
[959.12 - 964.24] mistakes like i've seen along the way
[961.60 - 965.76] and that's just that's just how it is
[964.24 - 967.04] you guys making nora rolls about
[965.76 - 968.64] starting a little bit i know you guys

[1037.36 - 1042.08] your consciousness
[1038.40 - 1045.28] and it hurts it hurts lunell
[1042.08 - 1046.88] soc is more practical than most you know
[1045.28 - 1048.40] the whole thing with
[1046.88 - 1051.36] yeah well i mean that's interesting and
[1048.40 - 1052.80] true so you
[1051.36 - 1055.52] you guys stop fooling around going
[1052.80 - 1055.52] around too much
[1058.88 - 1063.12] seaweed hero says seaweed hero good to
[1061.12 - 1066.08] see you why does facebook always say
[1063.12 - 1067.76] content can't be played right now so
[1066.08 - 1069.20] glad i can see you on youtube the reason
[1067.76 - 1070.16] why is because they're kicking everybody
[1069.20 - 1071.76] off of facebook
[1070.16 - 1073.44] facebook's supposed to have probably up
[1071.76 - 1075.36] to 10 000 people on there
[1073.44 - 1076.72] live and they kick them all off while
[1075.36 - 1078.72] you're trying to come on
[1076.72 - 1080.08] um so we only have like a few people
[1078.72 - 1081.28] they're only allowing a few people
[1080.08 - 1084.88] tonight that's what they do
[1081.28 - 1086.56] same thing on instagram um margot so
[1084.88 - 1089.68] getting viruses is completely
[1086.56 - 1091.04] random no no karma at all and there's no
[1089.68 - 1093.28] karma involved
[1091.04 - 1095.36] absolutely not absolutely not we come
[1093.28 - 1096.88] into this world of viruses we come into
[1095.36 - 1099.52] this world with ebv
[1096.88 - 1101.68] and shingles that we get from utero we
[1099.52 - 1104.56] get passed down from our parents we come
[1101.68 - 1104.96] into this world like that we easily can
[1104.56 - 1107.64] get
[1104.96 - 1109.52] viruses here i'll talk about that too
[1107.64 - 1112.40] relationships
[1109.52 - 1113.28] friendships drinking off of somebody's
[1112.40 - 1116.80] glass
[1113.28 - 1119.44] you can just it's easy to get pathogens
[1116.80 - 1119.84] you didn't ask to be sick like there's
[1119.44 - 1122.56] no
[1119.84 - 1124.16] karma involved that's not you're not
[1122.56 - 1126.56] paying back
[1124.16 - 1127.44] you're not paying back on the karmic
[1126.56 - 1129.36] channel
[1127.44 - 1131.76] you know so that's important too you
[1129.36 - 1134.84] know bugs were
[1131.76 - 1136.16] created by well they were they were
[1134.84 - 1138.80] manipulated
[1136.16 - 1139.92] bugs were manipulated a hundred years
[1138.80 - 1143.28] ago
[1139.92 - 1146.00] by some mad men okay in the industry
[1143.28 - 1147.52] they were manipulated they were raised
[1146.00 - 1149.92] propagated
[1147.52 - 1152.24] they were proliferated they were put
[1149.92 - 1154.32] into the system along the way
[1152.24 - 1155.60] and that's how it works darkness and bad
[1154.32 - 1159.04] people okay
[1155.60 - 1162.72] darkest bad people um
[1159.04 - 1164.48] your spiritual advisor so there's no bad
[1162.72 - 1166.08] people in the world
[1164.48 - 1169.60] what do you mean there's no bad people
[1166.08 - 1172.96] in the world you mean everybody's good
[1169.60 - 1176.88] so there's people aren't bad
[1172.96 - 1179.04] really that's hard to believe though
[1176.88 - 1180.72] because what about the six million jews
[1179.04 - 1184.24] that were gassed
[1180.72 - 1186.80] and murdered that there wasn't a
[1184.24 - 1189.36] bad thing or something well the people
[1186.80 - 1191.60] weren't bad that did it to them
[1189.36 - 1192.48] um so there's no bad people out there so
[1191.60 - 1195.76] what about
[1192.48 - 1196.32] all the viruses that they raised in all
[1195.76 - 1198.80] the
[1196.32 - 1200.40] eggs and stuff and then somehow escaped
[1198.80 - 1203.92] the labs
[1200.40 - 1206.24] bad people weren't creating bad bugs
[1203.92 - 1208.16] okay then how did it happen and that's
[1206.24 - 1210.48] how it works it's really kind of
[1208.16 - 1213.36] strange i'm gonna make some food can't
[1210.48 - 1213.36] fool around all night
[1214.32 - 1218.48] and um so
[1219.12 - 1223.12] so anyway i'm going to move the eggs and
[1221.44 - 1225.52] i'm also going to wash my
[1223.12 - 1227.60] hands really quick okay you guys bear
[1225.52 - 1229.68] with me please
[1227.60 - 1230.64] um i got a sink right here i don't know
[1229.68 - 1232.64] if you can see it you're probably
[1230.64 - 1235.68] catching a little bit of it there
[1232.64 - 1236.88] um touching eggs and i don't think it's
[1235.68 - 1239.28] a smart move to touch
[1236.88 - 1241.20] eggs and to be making minority rolls to
[1239.28 - 1242.40] start making normal let me get the blood
[1241.20 - 1245.04] off of the
[1242.40 - 1248.48] counter too if that's okay maybe even
[1245.04 - 1250.40] get my phone over here
[1248.48 - 1253.52] terry went against medical advice
[1250.40 - 1254.24] refused the meds and went with the 369
[1253.52 - 1258.40] protocol
[1254.24 - 1259.92] a1c from 100 from 10.5 to 6.5 in three
[1258.40 - 1262.24] months thank you anthony
[1259.92 - 1263.68] terry you're working hard you're working
[1262.24 - 1266.08] hard okay
[1263.68 - 1267.28] and you know you're you're working on it
[1266.08 - 1271.60] you're doing it
[1267.28 - 1273.36] okay so i thank you for doing the work
[1271.60 - 1275.28] and that's really you know if you guys
[1273.36 - 1276.72] get kicked off go to youtube if you guys
[1275.28 - 1278.16] get kicked off facebook i i always
[1276.72 - 1282.16] forget to say that go to youtube
[1278.16 - 1285.04] youtube live right now um
[1282.16 - 1285.60] anyway let's make some noise so what i'm
[1285.04 - 1288.40] gonna do
[1285.60 - 1288.88] is and i'm gonna make noise and talk
[1288.40 - 1290.56] about
[1288.88 - 1292.64] the vagus nerve a little bit too i just
[1290.56 - 1295.20] want to thinly slice
[1292.64 - 1295.76] i want to thinly slice some celery right
[1295.20 - 1297.04] here
[1295.76 - 1299.04] if you guys are okay with that we're
[1297.04 - 1300.08] going to do a little celery slicing
[1299.04 - 1302.16] right here
[1300.08 - 1303.68] the thing is with the vagus nerve it's
[1302.16 - 1305.60] always been a mystery
[1303.68 - 1307.92] no one knew it had anything to do with
[1305.60 - 1309.68] these symptoms before medical medium
[1307.92 - 1312.56] put the information out there so medical
[1309.68 - 1314.72] medium information was the vagus nerve
[1312.56 - 1316.16] becomes inflamed and you get the tingles
[1314.72 - 1318.64] and numbness and the tightness of the
[1316.16 - 1321.52] chest this 35 years of work
[1318.64 - 1323.28] and now the vagus nerve has seemed to
[1321.52 - 1324.80] get popular because just like medical
[1323.28 - 1326.24] medium information getting out there
[1324.80 - 1328.64] people pick up on it
[1326.24 - 1330.56] you guys can't even imagine or maybe you
[1328.64 - 1331.76] can't imagine how many practitioners and
[1330.56 - 1333.68] how many doctors
[1331.76 - 1335.20] have read the medical medium books never
[1333.68 - 1337.12] mind how many i've talked to before the
[1335.20 - 1340.64] medical meeting books came out
[1337.12 - 1344.32] and how medical immune information has
[1340.64 - 1345.60] has renovated the medical world or the
[1344.32 - 1349.28] holistic world too
[1345.60 - 1352.88] renovated refurbished
[1349.28 - 1356.32] because um no one knew what did what
[1352.88 - 1356.32] with all these mystery symptoms
[1356.56 - 1361.28] linda says so nobody's ever known what
[1359.04 - 1363.28] to do with the vagus nerve until the
[1361.28 - 1365.44] medical medium has
[1363.28 - 1367.68] spoken okay that's a bunch of charlton
[1365.44 - 1367.68] talk
[1369.04 - 1376.56] that's a good one there linda
[1372.80 - 1380.00] hey linda linda linda
[1376.56 - 1383.04] um just so you know
[1380.00 - 1388.80] medical medium book was published
[1383.04 - 1391.92] six and a half years ago yeah yeah and
[1388.80 - 1396.24] it was all unique and original
[1391.92 - 1399.60] fact yeah and then science and research
[1396.24 - 1400.32] took the information and published it
[1399.60 - 1402.40] later
[1400.32 - 1404.00] but you don't like that right so linda
[1402.40 - 1406.88] you don't like that
[1404.00 - 1407.60] okay so someone's not allowed to
[1406.88 - 1410.40] actually
[1407.60 - 1411.92] start something original and unique and
[1410.40 - 1414.80] take any credit
[1411.92 - 1416.00] okay okay so let me just bow down i
[1414.80 - 1419.04] can't take any credit
[1416.00 - 1421.04] ever i started all this new information
[1419.04 - 1423.92] that never was out there in the world
[1421.04 - 1424.56] published first by medical medium so i
[1423.92 - 1427.84] guess
[1424.56 - 1431.20] is it because i have a big ego linda and
[1427.84 - 1432.88] the ego needs to be fed it's not because
[1431.20 - 1434.40] i need people to heal so they could find
[1432.88 - 1435.76] out where it originated so they have
[1434.40 - 1438.96] answers
[1435.76 - 1442.08] uh okay all right i will bow down
[1438.96 - 1444.56] um i i didn't start anything new
[1442.08 - 1446.88] okay all right i i don't want to get you
[1444.56 - 1449.20] upset linda i know it's too much for you
[1446.88 - 1449.92] okay i'm gonna go i gotta go you're
[1449.20 - 1452.08] you're just
[1449.92 - 1454.40] you're really hard to talk to you guys
[1452.08 - 1456.24] have to understand this that
[1454.40 - 1458.72] what linda doesn't understand and it's
[1456.24 - 1461.76] really hard for her is that medical
[1458.72 - 1462.48] medium information started a tremendous
[1461.76 - 1464.16] amount
[1462.48 - 1466.00] of original and unique information
[1464.16 - 1468.16] that's in our system today yeah we knew
[1466.00 - 1472.08] about the vagus nerve of course we did
[1468.16 - 1473.28] we did not know that it gets inflamed we
[1472.08 - 1475.44] did not know
[1473.28 - 1476.48] that the epstein-barr inflames it we did
[1475.44 - 1478.32] not know
[1476.48 - 1480.24] that the vagus nerve causes tingles and
[1478.32 - 1482.96] numbness okay
[1480.24 - 1483.84] nausea we didn't know that tightness in
[1482.96 - 1486.96] chest
[1483.84 - 1487.84] alright anxiety we did not know of any
[1486.96 - 1491.04] of this information
[1487.84 - 1492.80] 35 years of work just like the blood
[1491.04 - 1495.12] draw information okay
[1492.80 - 1497.04] medical medium is the first to put out
[1495.12 - 1499.36] the information
[1497.04 - 1501.12] that they're removing too much blood
[1499.36 - 1502.40] removing your immune system and people
[1501.12 - 1505.04] are going backwards with
[1502.40 - 1506.40] their health that is unique and original
[1505.04 - 1508.56] medical mean information
[1506.40 - 1510.16] so why is it that i got to keep on
[1508.56 - 1511.36] coming out with unique original
[1510.16 - 1512.80] information that's never been heard
[1511.36 - 1514.32] anywhere else
[1512.80 - 1515.84] and then doctors take the information
[1514.32 - 1518.24] and then it goes around and goes around
[1515.84 - 1520.48] and then somebody named linda just
[1518.24 - 1522.32] doesn't want to hear it
[1520.48 - 1524.24] just doesn't even believe it and doesn't
[1522.32 - 1527.20] want to hear it when it's
[1524.24 - 1528.72] fact including other public publishing
[1527.20 - 1530.96] too
[1528.72 - 1532.88] linda says neurologist do you know that
[1530.96 - 1535.44] why are you acting like
[1532.88 - 1537.20] nobody knew that see this is arrogance
[1535.44 - 1538.00] right there and it's an appropriate
[1537.20 - 1541.28] neurologist
[1538.00 - 1544.40] know that that's possible and noted its
[1541.28 - 1546.80] medical journals really because
[1544.40 - 1548.48] millions of people went to neurologists
[1546.80 - 1549.28] and they didn't know their tingles and
[1548.48 - 1553.44] numbness
[1549.28 - 1556.88] came from their vagus nerve you are 100
[1553.44 - 1557.92] wrong they didn't know the nausea that
[1556.88 - 1559.92] was mysterious
[1557.92 - 1561.04] came from the vagus nerve they didn't
[1559.92 - 1562.80] know the vertigo
[1561.04 - 1565.04] ever came from the vagus nerve guess
[1562.80 - 1566.40] what they still don't
[1565.04 - 1568.16] medical research and science doesn't
[1566.40 - 1570.24] know any of this doctors are
[1568.16 - 1572.24] using the information now for medical
[1570.24 - 1575.60] media anxiety
[1572.24 - 1577.20] vertigo mysterious nausea is all from
[1575.60 - 1579.20] the vagus nerve that's medical medium
[1577.20 - 1580.40] information i'm really sorry but you're
[1579.20 - 1583.28] a hundred percent
[1580.40 - 1584.48] wrong call it arrogance call it what you
[1583.28 - 1586.96] want i'm a bad
[1584.48 - 1589.52] person you don't like me whatever
[1586.96 - 1592.08] doesn't matter
[1589.52 - 1592.64] michelle l my neurologist never told me
[1592.08 - 1594.80] that
[1592.64 - 1595.92] no neurologist has ever told anybody
[1594.80 - 1599.76] that not
[1595.92 - 1602.16] one neurologist pre-medical medium books
[1599.76 - 1604.08] probably don't even tell people that now
[1602.16 - 1606.88] and so i'm just saying but not one
[1604.08 - 1607.84] neurologist has ever told millions of
[1606.88 - 1610.48] women
[1607.84 - 1611.76] filing into doctor's offices the 35
[1610.48 - 1614.08] years work i've done
[1611.76 - 1614.88] the doctors i've talked to the over 200
[1614.08 - 1617.44] like 200
[1614.88 - 1618.40] 000 people i've talked to over all these
[1617.44 - 1621.12] decades
[1618.40 - 1622.32] not one person found a neurologist that
[1621.12 - 1623.76] knew the vagus nerve
[1622.32 - 1626.16] did any of those symptoms including
[1623.76 - 1629.20] vertigo not one not one healer
[1626.16 - 1630.32] not one doctor call it arrogance call
[1629.20 - 1632.80] what you want
[1630.32 - 1634.24] i don't care it's just a fact you know
[1632.80 - 1637.60] it's a fact
[1634.24 - 1638.72] and it's a proven fact if you do your
[1637.60 - 1640.64] research linda
[1638.72 - 1643.04] you look in the books and you do your
[1640.64 - 1646.40] research yeah it's a proven fact
[1643.04 - 1649.76] um anyway michelle exactly michelle so
[1646.40 - 1651.92] many thousands and thousands of women
[1649.76 - 1655.68] walked into the neurologist's office
[1651.92 - 1658.72] and never got told any of that exactly
[1655.68 - 1660.64] um ichota i'm looking at chota too it
[1658.72 - 1664.16] showed him a neurologist and i had
[1660.64 - 1666.48] many and never said anything even close
[1664.16 - 1669.12] to that either they told me
[1666.48 - 1670.16] they told me my post-concussion vertigo
[1669.12 - 1673.20] five months
[1670.16 - 1675.44] sorry five months on was all in my head
[1673.20 - 1676.56] so they just thought it was all in your
[1675.44 - 1677.60] head they thought you were making it up
[1676.56 - 1679.44] each other and that was
[1677.60 - 1681.36] that was many neurologists you went to
[1679.44 - 1684.64] right
[1681.36 - 1688.72] um and then uh let's see
[1684.64 - 1689.76] uh ud says bs we all know what the vagus
[1688.72 - 1692.64] nerve does
[1689.76 - 1693.76] oh you do it came from medical medium
[1692.64 - 1696.80] information
[1693.76 - 1699.68] so guess what you're talking bs
[1696.80 - 1700.80] sorry but you're talking bs see you know
[1699.68 - 1703.52] what's interesting
[1700.80 - 1703.92] this is how it's done like i noticed
[1703.52 - 1707.04] that
[1703.92 - 1707.92] trolls they ch you know they and and
[1707.04 - 1711.12] certain people
[1707.92 - 1713.76] haters and naysayers they just
[1711.12 - 1714.72] don't like the truth they don't they
[1713.76 - 1717.84] make stuff
[1714.72 - 1719.92] up monica i went to a neurologist
[1717.84 - 1721.12] vanderbilt could not tell me what was
[1719.92 - 1723.28] going on
[1721.12 - 1724.88] yeah incredible neurologist right could
[1723.28 - 1727.28] not tell anybody
[1724.88 - 1729.20] a marjorie i would have never known the
[1727.28 - 1730.64] reason why i was losing my voice it was
[1729.20 - 1733.68] the vagus nerve
[1730.64 - 1736.56] yeah exactly um
[1733.68 - 1737.28] sandra so the vagus nerve is inflamed by
[1736.56 - 1739.68] the ebv
[1737.28 - 1740.80] yes the shingles can inflame it too and
[1739.68 - 1742.16] i'm gonna cover that
[1740.80 - 1744.00] gotta make some food though we're having
[1742.16 - 1745.36] a good time tonight it's great
[1744.00 - 1747.52] jennifer it's frozen shoulder
[1745.36 - 1750.56] neurological if it's not an
[1747.52 - 1753.20] injury if it's not a bad injury
[1750.56 - 1753.92] my neurologist diagnosed me with it and
[1753.20 - 1756.16] can't
[1753.92 - 1757.76] sorry and believes it to be viral it's
[1756.16 - 1760.80] medical medium information
[1757.76 - 1763.76] so the shingles
[1760.80 - 1764.96] is the virus this is that's medical
[1763.76 - 1768.48] medium information
[1764.96 - 1771.44] originates from here not one doctor
[1768.48 - 1771.76] on the planet knew that frozen shoulder
[1771.44 - 1774.64] was
[1771.76 - 1775.36] viral this is you got to remember
[1774.64 - 1778.84] millions
[1775.36 - 1780.24] of this first edition went around the
[1778.84 - 1782.16] world
[1780.24 - 1783.68] patients brought their books into
[1782.16 - 1786.64] doctors there's not a doctor
[1783.68 - 1788.40] out there that a patient didn't bring in
[1786.64 - 1791.04] a medical medium book to them
[1788.40 - 1791.76] there's not one out there and so the
[1791.04 - 1794.00] shingles
[1791.76 - 1795.68] i released to the world how the shingles
[1794.00 - 1798.96] is behind frozen shoulder
[1795.68 - 1801.44] so yeah you guys i mean
[1798.96 - 1802.24] i don't need the credit for an ego thing
[1801.44 - 1804.56] just so you know
[1802.24 - 1806.32] okay so i know that someone might think
[1804.56 - 1808.16] that i don't need the credit for these
[1806.32 - 1810.88] incredible discoveries of
[1808.16 - 1812.64] medicine right that are being used right
[1810.88 - 1814.16] why everybody just dumps on me you know
[1812.64 - 1816.08] what i mean and says that where's my
[1814.16 - 1818.00] research papers where's my studies
[1816.08 - 1820.48] how come i'm not a doctor right and
[1818.00 - 1821.12] again i get peed on constantly all the
[1820.48 - 1824.88] time
[1821.12 - 1825.28] and i don't want credit because i got
[1824.88 - 1828.32] this
[1825.28 - 1829.84] like it's got to feed my ego i want
[1828.32 - 1831.84] people to be able to find out where they
[1829.84 - 1832.48] can hear how they can heal it it's one
[1831.84 - 1834.08] thing when
[1832.48 - 1836.80] a neurologist picks up the medical
[1834.08 - 1840.32] medium information tells a patient
[1836.80 - 1841.84] hey this is what's going on it's another
[1840.32 - 1844.48] for the patient to be able to actually
[1841.84 - 1846.48] find information and get and get better
[1844.48 - 1848.48] they they project their own darkness
[1846.48 - 1850.80] michelle ell says
[1848.48 - 1852.72] constant my dog constance my doctor
[1850.80 - 1853.44] looked at me like i had a third eye
[1852.72 - 1855.44] growing
[1853.44 - 1857.20] when i mentioned my vagus nerve was
[1855.44 - 1860.16] irritated and taking
[1857.20 - 1860.96] and and taking lemon balm helped relax
[1860.16 - 1864.00] it
[1860.96 - 1866.72] exactly but uh but
[1864.00 - 1868.24] constance i thought everybody knew about
[1866.72 - 1869.84] what the vagus nerve does i thought
[1868.24 - 1870.88] every single doctor knew what the vagus
[1869.84 - 1874.16] nerve does
[1870.88 - 1876.40] you know exactly luno
[1874.16 - 1878.08] it's frustrating the thing is is yeah it
[1876.40 - 1879.92] is lunalle says it must be so
[1878.08 - 1881.68] frustrating to share the info first and
[1879.92 - 1883.36] then so many plagiarizing and signs
[1881.68 - 1885.68] catching up with the mm info
[1883.36 - 1886.40] and still mm info gets dragged in the
[1885.68 - 1889.60] mud
[1886.40 - 1890.96] it's part of i guess the you know the
[1889.60 - 1893.28] entire
[1890.96 - 1894.80] journey exactly it's just it's
[1893.28 - 1897.12] incredible road let's make some noise
[1894.80 - 1899.20] rules let's get going on this
[1897.12 - 1900.64] but you know what i don't lose sleep
[1899.20 - 1905.04] over it
[1900.64 - 1907.76] because i figure it this way that
[1905.04 - 1908.16] look the information's getting out there
[1907.76 - 1910.16] okay
[1908.16 - 1911.68] people won't heal if they don't get the
[1910.16 - 1914.80] rest of the information
[1911.68 - 1917.84] right or if some of these some of these
[1914.80 - 1919.20] doctors or practitioners or health gurus
[1917.84 - 1921.52] take some of the information it look
[1919.20 - 1924.00] like heroes themselves fine
[1921.52 - 1925.76] i'm all right with that i just want
[1924.00 - 1928.40] people though to be able to get back to
[1925.76 - 1930.16] all the info to heal that's what gets my
[1928.40 - 1934.16] goat right there
[1930.16 - 1935.60] uh rachel paid 1 000 for the doctor
[1934.16 - 1938.08] and they couldn't explain my heart
[1935.60 - 1941.44] flutters took your microc
[1938.08 - 1944.80] no flutterings heart fluttering that's
[1941.44 - 1945.44] topic ectopic heart flutters that are a
[1944.80 - 1949.52] topic
[1945.44 - 1950.96] um uh mystery heart palpitations which
[1949.52 - 1952.64] i'm going to talk about medical medium
[1950.96 - 1954.00] it's the epstein-barr virus it's low
[1952.64 - 1958.24] grade viral right
[1954.00 - 1961.12] so um let's do like a little heart thing
[1958.24 - 1962.48] really quick we got a bigger heart
[1961.12 - 1965.20] you guys okay i'm taking a little food

[1967.28 - 1971.44] there's this sticky stuff
[1969.04 - 1972.16] that gets created by the epstein-barr
[1971.44 - 1974.80] virus
[1972.16 - 1976.08] okay advanced information the head of
[1974.80 - 1978.16] science and research of course
[1976.08 - 1979.92] and they're going to steal this too so
[1978.16 - 1980.56] they'll steal everything from me down
[1979.92 - 1982.56] the road
[1980.56 - 1983.76] which i don't care but people won't be
[1982.56 - 1985.28] able to find their way back
[1983.76 - 1987.04] to get all the information to heal all
[1985.28 - 1990.56] the way and that's what's scary to me
[1987.04 - 1993.36] so the virus sits inside the liver okay
[1990.56 - 1994.88] and it releases all of this byproduct
[1993.36 - 1995.60] and i'm talking about information right
[1994.88 - 1997.60] out of here
[1995.60 - 1998.72] new addition it releases all this
[1997.60 - 2000.80] byproduct
[1998.72 - 2002.48] the byproduct builds up in your liver
[2000.80 - 2004.40] and builds up in your liver and builds
[2002.48 - 2007.28] up in your liver this is the sludge
[2004.40 - 2008.64] and it builds up in your liver right and
[2007.28 - 2011.76] then eventually
[2008.64 - 2014.72] it puffs out of the liver and
[2011.76 - 2015.68] heads up the highway highway is your
[2014.72 - 2018.80] bloodstream
[2015.68 - 2022.48] heading directly to the heart
[2018.80 - 2023.68] that junk sticky jelly starts to build
[2022.48 - 2025.84] up in the valves
[2023.68 - 2027.76] becomes a mystery to the doctor it
[2025.84 - 2031.36] builds up in the mitral valve
[2027.76 - 2033.84] okay uh tricuspid valve it
[2031.36 - 2036.00] bicuspid valve if you're somebody with a
[2033.84 - 2039.20] bicuspid valve right
[2036.00 - 2042.32] and um aortic valve right
[2039.20 - 2046.56] so it gets in there okay and it and
[2042.32 - 2049.28] and then it sticks and all of a sudden
[2046.56 - 2050.40] it sticks for like like less than a
[2049.28 - 2051.52] millisecond
[2050.40 - 2053.52] and when it does that because the
[2051.52 - 2054.32] jelly's in there you get the heart
[2053.52 - 2055.68] flutters
[2054.32 - 2058.00] so when you start taking care of
[2055.68 - 2060.56] yourself like medical beam information
[2058.00 - 2062.08] the celery juice and everything else
[2060.56 - 2064.56] you're cleaning up your liver
[2062.08 - 2067.36] you're cleaning up that gunk all right
[2064.56 - 2070.40] and the heart palpitations go away or
[2067.36 - 2071.44] topic heartbeat or flutters they go away
[2070.40 - 2073.84] right
[2071.44 - 2075.44] there's a heart palpitation protocol in
[2073.84 - 2078.40] medical medium new addition too
[2075.44 - 2078.64] just just so you know right so let's go
[2078.40 - 2081.04] and
[2078.64 - 2082.16] just just cover one last thing with it
[2081.04 - 2086.84] but
[2082.16 - 2089.60] vagus nerve can also cause the problem
[2086.84 - 2093.36] electrically electrical
[2089.60 - 2096.88] your vagus nerve nerve nerves nerve
[2093.36 - 2097.92] signaling to the heart from toxic heavy
[2096.88 - 2101.52] metals
[2097.92 - 2103.60] and viruses inflaming the vagus nerve
[2101.52 - 2105.68] it could go that way or the junk in the
[2103.60 - 2107.76] heart it could go either or
[2105.68 - 2108.80] and then you got it right advanced
[2107.76 - 2111.44] medical information
[2108.80 - 2112.56] linda how do you like that just
[2111.44 - 2116.08] wondering
[2112.56 - 2117.44] um are you gone yet so let's think about
[2116.08 - 2122.08] vertigo in a second
[2117.44 - 2124.72] um okay right to vertigo
[2122.08 - 2127.52] natalie so what what do we do now vagus
[2124.72 - 2130.56] nerve exercises i want my life back
[2127.52 - 2133.92] from vertigo okay so
[2130.56 - 2136.64] if i had vertigo like what what um
[2133.92 - 2137.76] i was just talking about i mean for
[2136.64 - 2140.72] family members
[2137.76 - 2141.60] friends if i had vertigo i'd be on the
[2140.72 - 2143.60] micro sea
[2141.60 - 2145.12] and the microc was helping the other
[2143.60 - 2147.84] person with
[2145.12 - 2150.16] her vertigo because it was cleaning up
[2147.84 - 2152.32] the viral junk so that epstein-barr
[2150.16 - 2153.36] viral junk was getting cleaned up it was
[2152.32 - 2157.84] getting cleaned up
[2153.36 - 2159.60] out of the liver plus the vitamin c
[2157.84 - 2162.00] it does is it supports the immune system
[2159.60 - 2162.96] so your immune systems eat eating up the
[2162.00 - 2164.80] vitamin c
[2162.96 - 2166.80] your immune system your white blood
[2164.80 - 2168.40] cells they're there those are the things
[2166.80 - 2172.08] that actually fight the virus
[2168.40 - 2175.44] right so when you give your white
[2172.08 - 2176.96] blood cells vitamin c okay
[2175.44 - 2178.32] and you can get any vitamin c you want
[2176.96 - 2179.44] to get out there this is just the one i
[2178.32 - 2180.64] use for my for me
[2179.44 - 2183.04] my friends and family this is the
[2180.64 - 2184.80] vimergy microc and i'm not sponsored
[2183.04 - 2187.76] just letting you guys know which one i
[2184.80 - 2190.16] use and which one i give to my family
[2187.76 - 2191.12] so anyway the bottom line is your white
[2190.16 - 2193.76] count
[2191.12 - 2194.40] feeds off of vitamin c gets nice and
[2193.76 - 2196.96] strong
[2194.40 - 2198.48] then goes and kills off the epstein bar
[2196.96 - 2200.00] less epstein-barr
[2198.48 - 2201.68] heart flutters that are mystery
[2200.00 - 2204.16] mysterious from to the doctor
[2201.68 - 2205.28] start to go away that that's important
[2204.16 - 2207.12] right there okay
[2205.28 - 2208.32] um let's talk about vertigo a little bit
[2207.12 - 2211.60] too
[2208.32 - 2214.88] so okay let's go back to this so vertigo
[2211.60 - 2217.52] you got your epstein-barr virus okay
[2214.88 - 2218.56] the epstein-barr virus is releasing a
[2217.52 - 2220.80] neurotoxin
[2218.56 - 2222.64] it's feeding off of toxic heavy metals
[2220.80 - 2225.12] so say you're somebody that's
[2222.64 - 2226.96] into tuna you got all that mercury how
[2225.12 - 2227.76] much tuna have you had in your life
[2226.96 - 2229.52] right
[2227.76 - 2231.04] how much tuna have you eaten in your
[2229.52 - 2233.20] life so
[2231.04 - 2236.16] your epstein bars feeding off of all
[2233.20 - 2239.28] that mercury then it releases
[2236.16 - 2241.60] a neurotoxin the neurotoxin clings
[2239.28 - 2242.40] to the vagus nerve so it clings to the
[2241.60 - 2245.04] vagus nerve
[2242.40 - 2247.20] that's what the neurotoxin does and when
[2245.04 - 2247.76] it clings to the vagus nerve it inflames
[2247.20 - 2251.20] it
[2247.76 - 2253.84] and game on anything
[2251.20 - 2255.28] and everything can happen because that
[2253.84 - 2257.12] vagus nerve can inflame
[2255.28 - 2259.76] at the bottom it can inflame in the
[2257.12 - 2262.08] middle it can inflame at the top
[2259.76 - 2262.96] it can inflame even higher and when it
[2262.08 - 2264.72] gets inflamed
[2262.96 - 2266.40] you'll get the boat thing you're like
[2264.72 - 2267.12] rocking on the boat you're trying to
[2266.40 - 2268.96] walk
[2267.12 - 2270.80] you get the spins where you're just like
[2268.96 - 2272.72] this is going on and you're spinning
[2270.80 - 2274.88] you lay in the bed you're laying in your
[2272.72 - 2277.44] bed and you're at night and and the room
[2274.88 - 2277.44] is doing this
[2278.00 - 2281.60] like that you're not even spinning the
[2279.52 - 2284.48] room is going one way stopping
[2281.60 - 2286.08] going stopping like this and if anybody
[2284.48 - 2288.16] has vertigo now i'm really sorry that i
[2286.08 - 2289.84] hope i'm not creating a little bit of me
[2288.16 - 2290.88] not creating but i hope i'm not like
[2289.84 - 2292.40] tweaking you out
[2290.88 - 2293.92] that's how sensitive people get with
[2292.40 - 2296.40] vertigo where anything
[2293.92 - 2298.56] moving and if they can't watch
[2296.40 - 2300.80] television they can't watch a show
[2298.56 - 2302.88] they can't watch it's really hard right
[2300.80 - 2304.16] and protocols are in medical medium book
[2302.88 - 2306.24] one so
[2304.16 - 2308.08] i mean if you guys don't have this linda
[2306.24 - 2310.16] take the book to your doctor
[2308.08 - 2312.00] okay the the person that was hating on
[2310.16 - 2315.04] me take the book to your doctor ask
[2312.00 - 2317.52] your doctor what they think um
[2315.04 - 2319.76] candy says listen i get it but it's a
[2317.52 - 2320.64] little over the top today i think we
[2319.76 - 2323.92] have to hold
[2320.64 - 2326.00] respect for all points of view i believe
[2323.92 - 2329.28] what he says is excellent and what
[2326.00 - 2331.04] not but it's just triggered me candy
[2329.28 - 2332.72] this is kind of i totally see what
[2331.04 - 2335.76] you're saying like in one way
[2332.72 - 2338.32] right but linda had no respect
[2335.76 - 2338.96] for me okay she called me a charlatan so
[2338.32 - 2342.24] is that a
[2338.96 - 2345.20] point of view or is that just a hater
[2342.24 - 2346.80] and if i don't stick up for myself i'm
[2345.20 - 2347.60] going to be kicked down and kicked down
[2346.80 - 2349.28] and kicked down
[2347.60 - 2351.20] right i mean do you want me to be like
[2349.28 - 2354.32] that see if i lose
[2351.20 - 2356.32] that ability to stand up for myself
[2354.32 - 2357.68] i might also lose that ability to stand
[2356.32 - 2359.60] up for you
[2357.68 - 2362.40] okay did you ever think about that
[2359.60 - 2365.92] because i'm standing up for you

[2481.12 - 2488.88] ever has and i got to tell you guys
[2484.00 - 2491.12] it was really bad back years ago like
[2488.88 - 2492.40] if you got sick with anything that was
[2491.12 - 2494.96] mysterious
[2492.40 - 2497.04] families turned against you i've seen
[2494.96 - 2498.80] families turn against people i've seen
[2497.04 - 2500.80] friends turn against people
[2498.80 - 2502.32] i've seen doctors turn against people
[2500.80 - 2505.20] i've seen people lost
[2502.32 - 2506.48] no hope for years and years now it's a
[2505.20 - 2507.76] little better you can go to your
[2506.48 - 2509.52] functional medicine doctor and they'll
[2507.76 - 2510.72] be like hearing your symptoms now for
[2509.52 - 2511.60] the for you know because you're hearing
[2510.72 - 2513.12] them more and more
[2511.60 - 2515.04] and then they might have some respect
[2513.12 - 2517.84] but it wasn't like that
[2515.04 - 2518.08] kristin jay cohen he never said vitamin
[2517.84 - 2520.96] c
[2518.08 - 2520.96] solves vertigo
[2521.28 - 2528.00] um that's just one thing first of all
[2524.64 - 2530.08] so kristen that's one thing so it
[2528.00 - 2532.40] very important to know that vitamin c
[2530.08 - 2538.16] feeds your immune system and gives you
[2532.40 - 2539.76] a chance right so let you know um
[2538.16 - 2541.36] oh yeah you're correcting someone thank
[2539.76 - 2544.40] you thank you kristen thank you
[2541.36 - 2545.28] exactly exactly but it's one of the
[2544.40 - 2546.72] tools
[2545.28 - 2548.24] anyway that's the micro seed that's the
[2546.72 - 2549.76] one i give my friend and family just so
[2548.24 - 2551.76] you know because there's some bad
[2549.76 - 2552.40] vitamin c's out there that irritate the
[2551.76 - 2554.24] stomach
[2552.40 - 2555.76] that cause problems all of that's the
[2554.24 - 2559.20] only one i trust
[2555.76 - 2560.56] right here uh constance said lorraine
[2559.20 - 2561.52] for the win
[2560.56 - 2562.80] all right let's start let's start
[2561.52 - 2563.84] working on this a little bit i still
[2562.80 - 2566.00] want to talk about vertigo and
[2563.84 - 2569.68] everything
[2566.00 - 2571.60] i mean right
[2569.68 - 2573.52] i'm gonna grate some carrot are you guys
[2571.60 - 2578.72] okay with that it's kind of like
[2573.52 - 2580.40] just do a little bit this like
[2578.72 - 2583.12] kind of like great it's not really great
[2580.40 - 2586.32] but i'm making like um
[2583.12 - 2587.84] carrot noodles in a way right julianning
[2586.32 - 2589.44] them
[2587.84 - 2592.80] i think that's the right word for this
[2589.44 - 2595.28] process and
[2592.80 - 2596.72] all right there we go want a little bit
[2595.28 - 2599.84] of this grated
[2596.72 - 2601.52] carrot okay you can even do the same
[2599.84 - 2602.48] thing to a celery stick by the way with
[2601.52 - 2604.84] this
[2602.48 - 2607.84] say if you do this i like this right
[2604.84 - 2607.84] here
[2608.16 - 2611.84] so you can just do this as well to
[2610.24 - 2612.88] celery so you got it kind of like
[2611.84 - 2615.28] shredded
[2612.88 - 2617.68] which is nice i got some shredded celery
[2615.28 - 2620.80] got some shredded
[2617.68 - 2623.04] okay russell says the power of medical
[2620.80 - 2625.52] media and info is undeniable
[2623.04 - 2627.12] if you work at 100 and study the info
[2625.52 - 2629.68] and the books to a t
[2627.12 - 2631.44] it's miraculously russell i'm honored
[2629.68 - 2634.48] truly
[2631.44 - 2637.84] i am i am i am it matters

[2637.84 - 2640.48] i'm gonna put some orange in here if you
[2639.76 - 2642.48] guys don't
[2640.48 - 2649.44] mind i like to i'm gonna kind of like
[2642.48 - 2652.16] moisten it with some orange
[2649.44 - 2654.64] so these nori rolls are versatile you
[2652.16 - 2657.36] can do anything with them okay
[2654.64 - 2658.96] now if you're plant-based or vegan you
[2657.36 - 2661.20] can have a fat-free nori roll
[2658.96 - 2663.36] not put avocado in there or tahini but
[2661.20 - 2665.12] you can put tahini and avocado in this
[2663.36 - 2668.08] so i'm letting you know you can
[2665.12 - 2669.36] put tahini and avocado in there right so
[2668.08 - 2670.88] that's an option for you
[2669.36 - 2672.40] i have steamed potatoes over here i
[2670.88 - 2675.04] might do a little bit of that too as
[2672.40 - 2677.28] well you guys so

[2677.28 - 2682.48] here it was in my steamer
[2679.36 - 2683.92] right i always keep those handy
[2682.48 - 2685.76] but i got to tell you guys something
[2683.92 - 2689.04] interesting what people don't know
[2685.76 - 2690.96] is the amount of haters and the amount
[2689.04 - 2694.88] of hate and attacks
[2690.96 - 2696.40] that that i get and it's really gotten
[2694.88 - 2699.36] out of control like
[2696.40 - 2700.00] it was bad years ago but it's taken this
[2699.36 - 2703.12] new
[2700.00 - 2706.00] height that's just been immense
[2703.12 - 2707.76] and like my family tells me like how
[2706.00 - 2708.32] long are you gonna do this like how long
[2707.76 - 2710.56] can you
[2708.32 - 2711.52] stand it you know and it's and i'm like
[2710.56 - 2713.92] well no i'm in it
[2711.52 - 2714.88] i'm in it i'm not i'm not breaking from
[2713.92 - 2716.48] it i gotta
[2714.88 - 2718.80] fight for the people i gotta get them
[2716.48 - 2721.76] what they need if i disappear
[2718.80 - 2722.32] and just and and take a vacation or
[2721.76 - 2724.08] whatever
[2722.32 - 2725.60] and not a vacation whatever you call and
[2724.08 - 2727.68] i decide to like
[2725.60 - 2729.52] split the scene or whatever it's just it
[2727.68 - 2730.80] just wouldn't be fair to everybody and i
[2729.52 - 2733.84] always say that i'm putting some
[2730.80 - 2733.84] scallion in here

[2791.92 - 2795.36] the community know
[2793.60 - 2796.80] like if i don't let the community know
[2795.36 - 2799.68] though some things
[2796.80 - 2800.88] it's important because we're kind of all
[2799.68 - 2803.76] in this together
[2800.88 - 2805.52] because there are millions of people
[2803.76 - 2807.20] around the world right
[2805.52 - 2808.64] that would have never gotten this
[2807.20 - 2811.76] information
[2808.64 - 2814.24] if i wasn't standing up for myself
[2811.76 - 2814.96] or delivering this important information
[2814.24 - 2816.48] you know
[2814.96 - 2818.96] and here's the other thing jake what you
[2816.48 - 2821.84] don't understand okay is that there's
[2818.96 - 2822.48] there's trolls and haters that also try
[2821.84 - 2826.32] to
[2822.48 - 2828.00] confuse medical medium people who are
[2826.32 - 2829.52] working on their healing process so say
[2828.00 - 2830.08] you're somebody brand new when you're
[2829.52 - 2832.08] like
[2830.08 - 2833.28] you've been sick for years you've been
[2832.08 - 2835.28] to your 10th doctor
[2833.28 - 2836.80] you're losing your life you're losing
[2835.28 - 2839.04] everything right
[2836.80 - 2840.00] and you stumble across medical medium
[2839.04 - 2843.36] information
[2840.00 - 2845.12] okay and then somebody like jake
[2843.36 - 2846.64] maybe not you jake but somebody like
[2845.12 - 2849.12] jake says no
[2846.64 - 2850.24] he's a bad guy or his information
[2849.12 - 2853.36] doesn't work
[2850.24 - 2854.64] or ignore his stuff or he's just the
[2853.36 - 2857.60] celery juice guy
[2854.64 - 2858.00] and they get derailed and now they're on
[2857.60 - 2860.16] this
[2858.00 - 2861.92] path for another 10 years chronically
[2860.16 - 2863.44] ill they can't even get the right
[2861.92 - 2865.60] answers right information
[2863.44 - 2867.52] so if i don't kind of like make things
[2865.60 - 2869.68] well-rounded and talk about

[3271.20 - 3275.12] that they can start with a few things
[3274.08 - 3276.88] read the book
[3275.12 - 3279.44] though that's why it's so important to
[3276.88 - 3281.68] read the book and to read the chapter
[3279.44 - 3283.76] it's critical to to know what you can do
[3281.68 - 3285.28] or not do meaning what's easiest to do
[3283.76 - 3286.72] or what a great way to start
[3285.28 - 3288.40] but you'll see here fresh celery juice
[3286.72 - 3289.28] work up to 32 ounces if that's the only
[3288.40 - 3290.80] thing you do
[3289.28 - 3292.80] and that's how you start then that's how
[3290.80 - 3296.24] you start right and you see how you go
[3292.80 - 3298.56] now and then it says um
[3296.24 - 3299.44] celery force right so it's a celery
[3298.56 - 3301.36] force and that
[3299.44 - 3303.12] that is a great i don't even have it
[3301.36 - 3304.72] right here but celery force is an option
[3303.12 - 3307.92] for a lot of people it helps
[3304.72 - 3310.08] it is barley grass juice powder which um
[3307.92 - 3311.76] is the vimergy stuff that i use but you
[3310.08 - 3313.76] can if you want to use somebody else's
[3311.76 - 3315.12] barley grass use powder you can
[3313.76 - 3317.76] i'm just telling you the one i use that
[3315.12 - 3320.72] i trust the best and then it says b
[3317.76 - 3322.40] complex then it says cat's claw so
[3320.72 - 3324.24] here's a cat's claw here that
[3322.40 - 3326.32] i recommend for my family and friends
[3324.24 - 3329.52] that's the one i use right
[3326.32 - 3330.00] so it's cat's claw and it shows dosages
[3329.52 - 3332.40] in
[3330.00 - 3333.60] the book now you can ask your doctor any
[3332.40 - 3335.36] of this information you can take the
[3333.60 - 3337.36] book to your doctor
[3335.36 - 3339.28] i'm just telling you what i do for
[3337.36 - 3340.96] myself or for my family members i've
[3339.28 - 3343.44] never had vertigo
[3340.96 - 3345.28] but um but it doesn't mean i don't
[3343.44 - 3346.80] understand it and it doesn't mean i
[3345.28 - 3347.60] don't understand the pain and suffering
[3346.80 - 3350.48] involved
[3347.60 - 3352.08] and the hell people go through that cat
[3350.48 - 3352.64] cat's claw doesn't have alcohol in it
[3352.08 - 3354.40] and that's
[3352.64 - 3356.16] one thing that goes wrong when people be
[3354.40 - 3357.60] like all right i'll go get a cat's claw
[3356.16 - 3361.76] right that's the vimergy
[3357.60 - 3365.20] the uh v is victor i am as mary e r g y
[3361.76 - 3366.72] and um the there's no natural flavors
[3365.20 - 3367.92] there's no alcohol in here
[3366.72 - 3369.44] someone will get a cat's call and
[3367.92 - 3370.40] they'll just get one with alcohol and if
[3369.44 - 3372.88] this matters
[3370.40 - 3373.76] because someone could go out there buy a
[3372.88 - 3375.92] cat's claw
[3373.76 - 3377.28] anthony williams said do a cat squad and
[3375.92 - 3379.60] they go buy a cat's claw
[3377.28 - 3381.44] and i'm not getting better i'm getting
[3379.60 - 3384.40] worse or i'm not feeling good
[3381.44 - 3384.96] because the cat's got alcohol in it corn
[3384.40 - 3388.24] grain
[3384.96 - 3389.12] alcohol or natural flavors or citric
[3388.24 - 3391.52] acid
[3389.12 - 3392.80] right they had that in there so people
[3391.52 - 3394.16] got to understand like
[3392.80 - 3396.48] there's all these problems with
[3394.16 - 3398.32] supplements too so i have a directory at
[3396.48 - 3400.16] medical media.com for what i think is
[3398.32 - 3403.04] the safest and best right
[3400.16 - 3404.08] so cat's claws in here right there is an
[3403.04 - 3406.00] option um
[3404.08 - 3407.76] chaga mushroom that's a good mushroom
[3406.00 - 3410.00] for vertigo
[3407.76 - 3412.00] um curcumin that's one right there
[3410.00 - 3414.08] that's also a good option for
[3412.00 - 3416.16] don't have it right here but like i
[3414.08 - 3418.72] recommend the vimergy curcumin
[3416.16 - 3421.12] so and then um and then it goes on and
[3418.72 - 3424.16] it talks about lysine now
[3421.12 - 3427.60] that's a critical one right there
[3424.16 - 3429.20] lysine is critical for vertigo
[3427.60 - 3430.80] critical because you're dealing with the
[3429.20 - 3434.32] epstein-barr virus right
[3430.80 - 3435.92] so it's so important to know um
[3434.32 - 3438.16] these are these are the details that
[3435.92 - 3440.64] matter lemon balm
[3438.16 - 3442.32] right then it has the lemon balm there
[3440.64 - 3444.00] um there's a licorice root
[3442.32 - 3445.68] has the licorice root right there so
[3444.00 - 3448.16] there's a licorice root
[3445.68 - 3449.84] right and so you can just start out
[3448.16 - 3451.20] little at a time i talk about it in the
[3449.84 - 3452.56] book where you can just start out with a
[3451.20 - 3455.20] little b12
[3452.56 - 3456.64] a little bit of lemon balm um some
[3455.20 - 3458.80] vitamin c
[3456.64 - 3460.56] but but you know you can do that but the
[3458.80 - 3462.00] point is is that
[3460.56 - 3464.08] these are the different these are the
[3462.00 - 3466.16] different supplements and dosages
[3464.08 - 3468.00] this is what i recommend for family and
[3466.16 - 3469.84] friends right like the bimraji
[3468.00 - 3471.52] but like i said take the book to your
[3469.84 - 3472.88] doctor ask your doctor what's right for
[3471.52 - 3473.52] you maybe your doctor doesn't want you
[3472.88 - 3474.88] to use
[3473.52 - 3476.64] anything in the book and your worker
[3474.88 - 3480.08] wants to go different direction
[3476.64 - 3483.20] for you you know um i know and so
[3480.08 - 3485.28] the bottom line is the information is
[3483.20 - 3487.36] there though for vertigo because vertigo
[3485.28 - 3489.52] is caused by epsine bar
[3487.36 - 3491.04] barr likes to feed off of foods we like
[3489.52 - 3492.08] stepsim bar likes to feed off the eggs
[3491.04 - 3493.44] that are right there which i don't want
[3492.08 - 3496.72] to touch right now
[3493.44 - 3497.68] um so anyway these nori sheets got
[3496.72 - 3498.96] really wet
[3497.68 - 3502.16] from sitting here and not rolling them
[3498.96 - 3503.76] in time but i'm just gonna
[3502.16 - 3506.40] so guys i just made a few nori's gonna
[3503.76 - 3506.40] make one more
[3506.96 - 3510.72] i'm gonna do another potato one
[3510.96 - 3518.24] so thin sliced potato in here
[3516.48 - 3520.16] i'm going to use a little bit of lime in
[3518.24 - 3521.60] this one so you can you can like do
[3520.16 - 3524.32] different things just a little lime
[3521.60 - 3527.92] juice on here
[3524.32 - 3530.72] doctors can't help vertigo jason
[3527.92 - 3532.72] i agree they don't have any options they
[3530.72 - 3535.36] don't have anything that can
[3532.72 - 3536.96] i agree i know medical medium
[3535.36 - 3539.76] information has reversed
[3536.96 - 3541.52] so many people's vertigo conditions just
[3539.76 - 3544.32] thousands
[3541.52 - 3545.68] yeah i mean i totally understand i'm
[3544.32 - 3548.00] going to put a little bit more spinach
[3545.68 - 3548.00] in here
[3548.40 - 3552.00] and i'm going to put a little bit more
[3549.92 - 3552.64] of this dulce right here as a seaweed
[3552.00 - 3554.80] right
[3552.64 - 3556.64] i think i'll get a little red pepper
[3554.80 - 3558.24] here i'm having a great time tonight
[3556.64 - 3560.96] with you guys
[3558.24 - 3560.96] i always do
[3566.00 - 3572.96] um so let's put a little bit of red bell
[3570.16 - 3576.16] pepper here
[3572.96 - 3576.16] and i'm going to roll this up
[3580.48 - 3586.80] sigridowski says evil people can be very
[3584.00 - 3587.52] covertly hostile and are always in bad
[3586.80 - 3589.68] mood
[3587.52 - 3591.04] most people have a hard time to see what
[3589.68 - 3593.52] is true or not
[3591.04 - 3596.08] i know everything mm says is true i do
[3593.52 - 3597.04] health food since 40 years oh my god 40
[3596.08 - 3600.08] years in it
[3597.04 - 3602.80] wow wow
[3600.08 - 3604.16] you got me beat been doing this for 35
[3602.80 - 3607.68] years yeah since age
[3604.16 - 3609.20] four i've been giving uh people advice
[3607.68 - 3610.08] with their health and spirit compassion
[3609.20 - 3611.68] talking to me
[3610.08 - 3613.60] so i guess you could say since age four
[3611.68 - 3617.28] so it's a lot more than 35 years
[3613.60 - 3619.84] but you know really hardcore
[3617.28 - 3619.84] is different
[3620.40 - 3624.80] so yeah okay guys i just made a few of
[3622.32 - 3629.28] these let me cut them for you too
[3624.80 - 3630.80] okay let me move the cat's claw out okay
[3629.28 - 3632.64] did you guys get your wild blueberry
[3630.80 - 3634.16] juice yet i'm so pumped up about this
[3632.64 - 3636.56] stuff it's so incredible
[3634.16 - 3636.56] um
[3637.36 - 3640.56] so let's talk about titus in the chest
[3639.04 - 3642.24] what happens is when the vagus nerve
[3640.56 - 3645.76] gets inflamed okay
[3642.24 - 3648.56] see how i'm cutting these right
[3645.76 - 3649.20] i'm cutting them a little smaller so
[3648.56 - 3652.32] they're not
[3649.20 - 3654.00] huge pieces right when the vagus nerve
[3652.32 - 3655.52] gets inflamed you can get the tightness
[3654.00 - 3658.32] in the chest which is really in
[3655.52 - 3658.88] a difficult one now the vagus nerve when
[3658.32 - 3663.12] it gets it
[3658.88 - 3665.52] inflamed higher like higher up
[3663.12 - 3666.96] brain or down lower in the neck you can
[3665.52 - 3668.64] still get tightness to the chest you can
[3666.96 - 3671.20] still get tightness in the chest
[3668.64 - 3671.92] when the vagus nerve is inflamed at the
[3671.20 - 3673.60] bottom
[3671.92 - 3675.68] but what you usually get when the vagus
[3673.60 - 3676.48] nerve is inflamed at the bottom is a lot
[3675.68 - 3681.68] of
[3676.48 - 3682.80] nausea that's unexplainable right nausea
[3681.68 - 3685.76] so i'm going to start putting some of
[3682.80 - 3689.12] these here for you guys
[3685.76 - 3689.12] you can make a dipping sauce
[3690.40 - 3695.12] too like so many different dipping
[3692.16 - 3695.12] sauces you can do
[3696.84 - 3701.92] right
[3699.60 - 3701.92] um
[3704.08 - 3708.08] jessica i had my blood taken recently
[3706.48 - 3710.88] and have been crazy hungry
[3708.08 - 3712.48] since yeah that's a glucose deficiency
[3710.88 - 3714.80] when they take out your blood
[3712.48 - 3715.60] did you look at did you you did you
[3714.80 - 3718.56] listened to the
[3715.60 - 3719.04] medical mean podcast at apple podcast
[3718.56 - 3720.72] okay
[3719.04 - 3722.08] medical meeting podcast at apple podcast
[3720.72 - 3723.84] the blood draw
[3722.08 - 3725.44] episode link is in description share it
[3723.84 - 3728.08] with everybody you know i mean i would
[3725.44 - 3729.28] beg you guys like i want to beg you guys
[3728.08 - 3731.68] to share
[3729.28 - 3732.72] that podcast with everybody and anybody
[3731.68 - 3735.04] you know
[3732.72 - 3736.64] um because i want to help people so
[3735.04 - 3737.20] badly when they remove too much blood
[3736.64 - 3738.80] from you
[3737.20 - 3740.24] or remove blood from you they're
[3738.80 - 3741.68] removing glucose
[3740.24 - 3743.04] and here's how it works and i want to
[3741.68 - 3746.08] give you that i want to give you a quick
[3743.04 - 3746.08] rundown on that okay
[3746.16 - 3750.00] when they remove your blood your glucose
[3748.64 - 3753.20] from blood draws
[3750.00 - 3754.24] right that glucose is what's keeping
[3753.20 - 3757.60] your brain
[3754.24 - 3759.68] strong so the minute that glucose
[3757.60 - 3761.84] get disappears from the blood draw your
[3759.68 - 3765.84] brain will know it's starving
[3761.84 - 3767.36] it's starving um within five seconds of
[3765.84 - 3768.32] not getting glucose your brain starts to
[3767.36 - 3770.40] die
[3768.32 - 3772.24] i mean it's really five seconds it just
[3770.40 - 3773.68] starts it's like it needs glucose
[3772.24 - 3775.36] and you still have glucose that's why
[3773.68 - 3777.60] you're okay but
[3775.36 - 3779.84] even some taken out like on the blood
[3777.60 - 3782.24] draw even with some taken out
[3779.84 - 3784.16] you can feel it and be just starving be
[3782.24 - 3785.76] hungry for a long time
[3784.16 - 3788.00] so that happens all the time to drop
[3785.76 - 3790.72] that that happens all the time
[3788.00 - 3792.88] um but anyway i'm gonna just cut these
[3790.72 - 3796.72] up and then we're almost there you guys
[3792.88 - 3800.40] look at how crazy these are right here
[3796.72 - 3802.48] all right so um listen to the blood draw
[3800.40 - 3804.00] podcast
[3802.48 - 3805.76] there's no commercials there's no
[3804.00 - 3808.24] advertisers that's

[3833.20 - 3835.84] messy but
[3834.16 - 3838.40] this stuff just gets messy with these
[3835.84 - 3840.96] sometimes putting these in
[3838.40 - 3840.96] right here
[3841.68 - 3846.72] okay let's get these going
[3848.24 - 3850.64] all right
[3851.76 - 3858.08] so a little messy but
[3855.92 - 3859.52] that's just you know we're live and i'm
[3858.08 - 3860.16] kind of paying attention to the comments
[3859.52 - 3862.24] and everything
[3860.16 - 3863.84] so it's not going to be perfect but
[3862.24 - 3865.44] that's it that's the dory rolls you can
[3863.84 - 3867.44] do a lot with there's potato in this one

[3869.20 - 3876.64] shredded shredded celery
[3873.68 - 3877.68] alicia so donating blood hurts us does
[3876.64 - 3880.64] our blood donation
[3877.68 - 3881.28] hurt the recipient do they get our ebv
[3880.64 - 3884.32] and other
[3881.28 - 3886.32] viruses they get our ebv yeah they do
[3884.32 - 3888.32] they get her up they get her ebv's they
[3886.32 - 3888.96] get her simplexes they get her other
[3888.32 - 3892.88] viruses
[3888.96 - 3895.44] they get hhv sixes but
[3892.88 - 3896.08] but i mean this is life i mean it's it's
[3895.44 - 3898.64] either
[3896.08 - 3899.12] the the thing is with blood donation is
[3898.64 - 3901.36] is
[3899.12 - 3902.96] we need blood donations right because we
[3901.36 - 3903.68] need to save people's lives for
[3902.96 - 3907.60] surgeries
[3903.68 - 3909.20] life-saving medicine car accidents um
[3907.60 - 3910.96] all kinds of issues right with heart
[3909.20 - 3913.12] surgeries all of it so we need
[3910.96 - 3914.96] we need blood transfusions for a lot of
[3913.12 - 3915.60] different conditions so we need that so
[3914.96 - 3917.68] yeah
[3915.60 - 3918.64] people might pick up you know somebody
[3917.68 - 3922.00] else's ebv
[3918.64 - 3924.48] but ebv doesn't ebv is not really in the
[3922.00 - 3925.12] blood a lot so that's why it's it's okay
[3924.48 - 3926.88] because
[3925.12 - 3928.24] even though you could potentially
[3926.88 - 3930.00] somebody could get potentially get
[3928.24 - 3932.16] somebody's ebv but that's if it's more
[3930.00 - 3934.16] of an infectious stage in that moment
[3932.16 - 3936.00] but if it's not an infectious stage not
[3934.16 - 3938.00] reactivated or anything like that
[3936.00 - 3940.00] then they won't get it chances are they
[3938.00 - 3941.20] won't get it because ebv tends to stay
[3940.00 - 3942.96] in all the organs
[3941.20 - 3944.72] and it hides in all the organs but
[3942.96 - 3946.72] someone could potentially get one from
[3944.72 - 3948.00] somebody's shore through that it it does
[3946.72 - 3950.00] happen but that's
[3948.00 - 3951.44] not my concern is this is listen to the
[3950.00 - 3953.12] podcast though right the blood draw
[3951.44 - 3954.80] podcast my concern is
[3953.12 - 3956.40] and your number one question is does
[3954.80 - 3959.60] blood draw does does
[3956.40 - 3962.80] donated blood hurt us and
[3959.60 - 3965.20] i talk about how it takes away our
[3962.80 - 3966.56] immune system so that our ebvs can come
[3965.20 - 3969.04] out of dormancy
[3966.56 - 3970.32] they can get reactivated we can have
[3969.04 - 3972.24] more problems with their health we can
[3970.32 - 3974.40] go backwards with their symptoms
[3972.24 - 3976.32] so it's not it's not i don't want you to
[3974.40 - 3978.24] not donate blood but i talk about maybe
[3976.32 - 3979.60] a better way of doing it like preparing
[3978.24 - 3980.64] yourself taking care of yourself
[3979.60 - 3983.68] beforehand
[3980.64 - 3984.48] i also recommend uh more men donating
[3983.68 - 3986.32] blood because
[3984.48 - 3987.92] it's just women that donate blood and i
[3986.32 - 3989.60] know that's a pretty
[3987.92 - 3991.04] bold statement that it's just women
[3989.60 - 3993.28] donating blood
[3991.04 - 3994.08] because there are men donating blood yes
[3993.28 - 3996.48] but there's
[3994.08 - 3998.00] mostly women and mostly women that don't
[3996.48 - 4000.80] feel good donate blood
[3998.00 - 4002.64] women that uh there's this small
[4000.80 - 4004.24] percentage of women that feel healthy
[4002.64 - 4005.68] and strong and don't have any symptoms
[4004.24 - 4008.00] that ever donate blood
[4005.68 - 4009.20] they're just but but what's interesting
[4008.00 - 4011.52] is it's like
[4009.20 - 4012.48] women that are living with symptoms and
[4011.52 - 4014.24] not feeling good
[4012.48 - 4015.76] and dealing with issues of all kinds
[4014.24 - 4017.12] they're the ones donating blood for the
[4015.76 - 4018.24] most part they make up the majority of
[4017.12 - 4019.68] the blood donations which is
[4018.24 - 4020.40] unbelievable when you think about it
[4019.68 - 4023.76] right
[4020.40 - 4026.72] and those are the people that
[4023.76 - 4028.00] that need their reserves and need their
[4026.72 - 4029.68] immune system strong
[4028.00 - 4031.44] and then they're the ones giving out all
[4029.68 - 4032.96] the blood and weakening themselves more
[4031.44 - 4034.48] and more
[4032.96 - 4036.80] that's scary all in its own when i
[4034.48 - 4038.40] really think about it but
[4036.80 - 4039.92] the bottom line is you can protect
[4038.40 - 4041.52] yourself before a blood donation you
[4039.92 - 4043.04] protect yourself after a blood donation
[4041.52 - 4043.68] so i talk about that in the medical mean
[4043.04 - 4045.60] podcast
[4043.68 - 4047.68] at apple podcast link is in the
[4045.60 - 4049.76] description the blood draw episode right
[4047.68 - 4051.68] and you can learn more about it and i
[4049.76 - 4052.40] believe we need to donate blood yeah but
[4051.68 - 4054.48] but there's
[4052.40 - 4055.92] ways to do it especially if you have a
[4054.48 - 4057.60] symptom or you have a condition that's
[4055.92 - 4058.40] when i tell people you know don't do it
[4057.60 - 4060.56] for now
[4058.40 - 4062.08] don't donate blood now when you're sick
[4060.56 - 4063.44] because then you lose your immune system
[4062.08 - 4065.76] through the blood donation they take a
[4063.44 - 4067.04] pint of blood they take a large part of
[4065.76 - 4069.12] your immune system and then you can go
[4067.04 - 4069.44] backwards and even get so sick you might
[4069.12 - 4071.04] be
[4069.44 - 4072.40] ending up needing a blood transfusion
[4071.04 - 4072.72] down the road because sickness gets you
[4072.40 - 4074.88] know
[4072.72 - 4076.32] it takes over so but listen to the
[4074.88 - 4078.16] podcast episode
[4076.32 - 4080.40] for sure it's it's all important
[4078.16 - 4082.64] information
[4080.40 - 4084.56] janelle i never seen a man donating
[4082.64 - 4088.16] blood at the blood bank
[4084.56 - 4091.52] um no it's rare it's rare
[4088.16 - 4093.60] so the system has and i'll tell you one
[4091.52 - 4096.64] of the reasons why this is interesting
[4093.60 - 4099.20] the system has trained women to do it
[4096.64 - 4100.48] you know and now the system works like
[4099.20 - 4102.80] the medical system
[4100.48 - 4104.08] trains women they want to train women
[4102.80 - 4106.88] like dogs
[4104.08 - 4107.28] like like dogs that's what they do and
[4106.88 - 4109.12] it's
[4107.28 - 4111.44] higher up it's not the doctors but it's
[4109.12 - 4112.72] higher up and they train women to give
[4111.44 - 4115.36] out all their blood
[4112.72 - 4117.52] that's what they do they train women who
[4115.36 - 4119.20] are sick to give out all their blood
[4117.52 - 4120.88] okay is there something wrong with that
[4119.20 - 4122.24] don't you think like is there something
[4120.88 - 4125.12] wrong with that or what
[4122.24 - 4126.80] and and then this is like this is
[4125.12 - 4130.00] unbelievable when i think about it
[4126.80 - 4130.64] right um and so this is just some of
[4130.00 - 4132.00] this stuff
[4130.64 - 4133.84] anyway you got to hear the podcast
[4132.00 - 4134.48] medically and podcasted apple podcast
[4133.84 - 4137.20] and you're right
[4134.48 - 4138.32] no there's there's it's ever it's rare
[4137.20 - 4139.76] oh here's another thing
[4138.32 - 4141.44] it's rare you're going to see women
[4139.76 - 4142.00] donating blood at the blood donation
[4141.44 - 4144.72] clinic
[4142.00 - 4146.00] that are strong healthy with no symptoms
[4144.72 - 4147.28] how's that
[4146.00 - 4148.32] women that are just out there living
[4147.28 - 4151.36] their life don't even know what it's
[4148.32 - 4153.28] like to be sick never had a symptom yet
[4151.36 - 4155.04] they're not donating blood ever they're
[4153.28 - 4156.80] just like it's they're not
[4155.04 - 4158.72] thinking about it i don't know i think
[4156.80 - 4162.00] but for some reason
[4158.72 - 4163.76] women that are not well and struggling
[4162.00 - 4165.28] they're like for some reason they're
[4163.76 - 4168.16] hurting them in like
[4165.28 - 4169.92] cattle or something to just or sheep to
[4168.16 - 4170.64] just get in to just dump all their blood
[4169.92 - 4174.16] out
[4170.64 - 4175.92] it's the most bizarre thing um
[4174.16 - 4178.00] clearly nature what do you do for chest
[4175.92 - 4180.32] tightness so chest tightness is an
[4178.00 - 4181.28] eptine epstein-barr shingle so these are
[4180.32 - 4184.48] viral
[4181.28 - 4187.44] symptoms vagus nerve gets inflamed and
[4184.48 - 4188.32] look ask your doctor what he or she
[4187.44 - 4190.32] thinks okay
[4188.32 - 4192.00] you take the book to your doctor right
[4190.32 - 4193.36] but if it was me and i had chest
[4192.00 - 4196.08] tightness that was
[4193.36 - 4197.44] uh mysterious to the doctor if it was me
[4196.08 - 4198.96] i'd be going through here
[4197.44 - 4201.44] i'd be looking at the epstein-barr
[4198.96 - 4203.44] protocol that's what i would be doing
[4201.44 - 4205.60] i would discover it's the vagus nerve
[4203.44 - 4207.36] being inflamed that's what i would do
[4205.60 - 4209.28] if it was happening to a family member i
[4207.36 - 4212.40] would look in here and i'd be like okay
[4209.28 - 4214.40] well i want my uncle on the micro sea
[4212.40 - 4215.92] that's what i want my uncle on i mean
[4214.40 - 4217.44] you do what you need to do and you you
[4215.92 - 4218.72] talk to your doctor and do what he tells
[4217.44 - 4221.12] you to do but i'm just saying
[4218.72 - 4221.76] that i would have my uncle on some lemon
[4221.12 - 4224.16] balm
[4221.76 - 4225.28] i'd be like you know that's what i would
[4224.16 - 4227.36] do is
[4225.28 - 4228.96] it and i'd be looking in here you know
[4227.36 - 4230.56] and saying okay well my uncle needs to
[4228.96 - 4232.64] beyond lysine
[4230.56 - 4234.72] and i'm looking at the dosages in here
[4232.64 - 4238.16] and it says dosages
[4234.72 - 4240.40] and well you know let me ask my doctor
[4238.16 - 4242.64] you know sure but i would just say to my
[4240.40 - 4244.32] uncle here it is
[4242.64 - 4245.84] gina says i had a doctor recommended i
[4244.32 - 4248.88] donate to to
[4245.84 - 4251.92] rid iron overload
[4248.88 - 4254.00] um that's
[4251.92 - 4255.92] modern day bloodletting just like blood
[4254.00 - 4256.48] draws in general are they take so much
[4255.92 - 4257.84] blood
[4256.48 - 4260.32] they don't need to take this much blood
[4257.84 - 4263.36] i mean i look i talked about this before
[4260.32 - 4264.96] um so that's all the blood they need
[4263.36 - 4266.56] just for an a1c you guys probably can't
[4264.96 - 4268.24] even see it i got a lot of lights on me
[4266.56 - 4270.64] right now you see that little dot
[4268.24 - 4272.32] that's all they need for just an a1c
[4270.64 - 4272.96] that's all they need for just a blood
[4272.32 - 4274.24] test
[4272.96 - 4277.04] but when you're talking about high in
[4274.24 - 4278.96] iron and being like being high in iron
[4277.04 - 4280.80] instead of science research learning how
[4278.96 - 4282.32] to fix the problem learning how to work
[4280.80 - 4284.16] with the liver the spleen
[4282.32 - 4285.68] and and the bones and the toxic heavy
[4284.16 - 4288.08] metals that are inside
[4285.68 - 4290.08] a woman's body that are causing that and
[4288.08 - 4291.36] the viral issues that are causing high
[4290.08 - 4294.88] iron instead of
[4291.36 - 4297.20] signs of research trying to discover why
[4294.88 - 4298.56] someone has high iron right instead of
[4297.20 - 4300.56] them doing that
[4298.56 - 4302.24] they just do the bloodletting so they
[4300.56 - 4304.64] just say hey dump your blood
[4302.24 - 4306.64] you know let's let's you know let's take
[4304.64 - 4308.24] out your blood let's draw blood from you
[4306.64 - 4310.24] so they draw blood or they tell you to
[4308.24 - 4312.00] donate blood right
[4310.24 - 4313.84] and instead of them trying to find out
[4312.00 - 4315.44] what's going on and with medical medium
[4313.84 - 4317.44] books you'll find out it's it's
[4315.44 - 4319.76] it's the low-grade viral issues it's the
[4317.44 - 4320.64] toxic heavy metals mercury is a really
[4319.76 - 4322.96] big one for
[4320.64 - 4324.64] why iron goes all over the place so
[4322.96 - 4326.16] these just information that's really
[4324.64 - 4327.44] helpful i made some noise you guys i'm
[4326.16 - 4330.00] heading off soon to
[4327.44 - 4331.92] on average they draw two tubes cbc and
[4330.00 - 4335.60] cmp
[4331.92 - 4339.44] on average um no
[4335.60 - 4342.64] it's not on average um diana
[4339.44 - 4343.44] average seven tubes seven tubes for
[4342.64 - 4345.60] anything
[4343.44 - 4347.20] seven tubes everybody goes to get blood
[4345.60 - 4347.76] work no matter what blood test the
[4347.20 - 4351.28] doctor
[4347.76 - 4353.04] orders seven tubes five tubes is way too
[4351.28 - 4356.16] much and five tubes they do
[4353.04 - 4359.68] it a lot of times five tubes go out
[4356.16 - 4361.84] right yeah if they just want a complete
[4359.68 - 4362.64] blood count and you lock your doctor
[4361.84 - 4365.84] down on that
[4362.64 - 4368.88] cbc and you hold your doctor to it
[4365.84 - 4370.28] then yes they may take two tubes but
[4368.88 - 4373.60] that's not how it works
[4370.28 - 4375.36] 99.9 of everybody goes
[4373.60 - 4376.80] to their doctor their doctor orders the
[4375.36 - 4380.32] blood tests and five
[4376.80 - 4382.96] tubes minimum they get they take minimum
[4380.32 - 4384.32] no matter what seven tubes 14 tubes 10
[4382.96 - 4386.64] tubes and that's not when you
[4384.32 - 4388.00] if you're getting sick so say you're
[4386.64 - 4389.44] somebody and you've never had a symptom
[4388.00 - 4390.80] in your life and you're at a checkup at
[4389.44 - 4392.88] your doctor's office and they just want
[4390.80 - 4394.80] to look at your cbc
[4392.88 - 4396.88] yeah you might get that one doctor that
[4394.80 - 4400.40] says just takes two tubes
[4396.88 - 4401.92] but i'm sorry 99.9 percent of them will
[4400.40 - 4403.44] take five
[4401.92 - 4405.04] tubes and they'll be like oh we're gonna
[4403.44 - 4406.24] check your vitamin d2 we're gonna check
[4405.04 - 4409.44] this yeah you gotta
[4406.24 - 4411.20] hold your doctor down you gotta hold
[4409.44 - 4413.60] your doctor down
[4411.20 - 4416.32] but yeah i mean and right now people are
[4413.60 - 4418.32] going backwards fast right now because
[4416.32 - 4419.84] of new medical treatment so i'm just
[4418.32 - 4420.96] gonna do a whistle are you guys okay
[4419.84 - 4423.44] with the whistle right now
[4420.96 - 4423.44] are you ready
[4424.16 - 4432.08] new medical treatment
[4427.76 - 4432.08] making people go downhill fast
[4432.40 - 4436.40] real fast give it six months to eight
[4434.72 - 4441.84] months to a year
[4436.40 - 4441.84] people are gonna be a real sick
[4443.44 - 4447.04] giving everybody like a little heads up
[4445.12 - 4448.48] there and
[4447.04 - 4450.08] that's why this is probably the most
[4448.48 - 4453.68] important book of the
[4450.08 - 4454.00] century because we're heading to a very
[4453.68 - 4457.44] bad
[4454.00 - 4459.92] place with a lot of sick people
[4457.44 - 4462.24] and um and they're gonna need to know
[4459.92 - 4463.76] why the reactivated epson bar
[4462.24 - 4466.32] is reactivating and they're going
[4463.76 - 4469.12] downhill fast so we have to make sure
[4466.32 - 4470.40] they get the information there i think
[4469.12 - 4471.28] some of you guys know what that whistle
[4470.40 - 4473.20] means
[4471.28 - 4474.32] i have a feeling i think probably a
[4473.20 - 4475.52] bunch of you are like why is he
[4474.32 - 4478.72] whistling
[4475.52 - 4478.72] why the heck is he whistling
[4479.84 - 4483.84] christina bailey i have been getting 14
[4482.08 - 4484.72] tubes of blood drawn every four months
[4483.84 - 4487.04] for years
