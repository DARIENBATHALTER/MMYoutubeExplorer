[1.28 - 7.72] how many people do you know who struggle
[4.32 - 10.24] with their health chances are whether
[7.72 - 14.48] they show it or not most of the people
[10.24 - 17.56] in your life do and chances are you're
[14.48 - 21.40] one of them whether you're dealing with
[17.56 - 25.88] anxiety depression endometriosis acne
[21.40 - 28.44] eczema autoimmune thyroid lime brain fog
[25.88 - 31.20] fatigue or any other symptom or
[28.44 - 34.52] condition you're far from from
[31.20 - 38.64] alone living with symptoms has become
[34.52 - 41.72] The New Normal so no more guessing games
[38.64 - 46.16] it's time to get answers welcome to the
[41.72 - 46.16] medical medium podcast I'm Anthony
[46.72 - 52.36] William hey everybody we're talking
[49.36 - 54.88] about modern-day vampirism now before
[52.36 - 57.56] you jump into any conclusions we're not
[54.88 - 59.56] talking about people with fangs in Black
[57.56 - 60.48] capes leaving two bite marks on your
[59.56 - 63.12] neck
[60.48 - 65.64] that would be scary it's way worse than
[63.12 - 68.96] that because it's real and it's
[65.64 - 72.16] happening to you and it defies all
[68.96 - 75.32] sensibility of the medical system what I
[72.16 - 77.04] have to tell you is not an old folklore
[75.32 - 79.36] story about
[77.04 - 82.72] Transylvania instead it's about your
[79.36 - 84.76] life your family your loved ones your
[82.72 - 86.80] safety and life
[84.76 - 91.20] preservation and if you have a chronic
[86.80 - 93.84] illness it's make or break do or die
[91.20 - 97.76]  or get off the pot we're talking
[93.84 - 100.44] about blood draw your blood tests I'm
[97.76 - 103.52] not against getting your blood tested
[100.44 - 106.12] it's important it can be a window into
[103.52 - 109.12] important information about your overall
[106.12 - 111.92] health but blood testing is still
[109.12 - 114.60] Antiquated it's running on Old stats and
[111.92 - 117.20] averages of people that have long since
[114.60 - 119.88] been gone during a time period in
[117.20 - 122.24] history when so much was so much
[119.88 - 124.80] different than what it is today normal
[122.24 - 127.88] standards in today's blood profile comes
[124.80 - 130.44] from long ago past and hasn't been
[127.88 - 134.24] updated blood testing is not a
[130.44 - 136.52] definitive accurate 100% clear method of
[134.24 - 139.72] providing somebody with answers to why
[136.52 - 143.40] they're chronically ill but it's still
[139.72 - 146.20] important lifesaving and good doctors
[143.40 - 148.08] are learning to read between the lines
[146.20 - 150.44] when they're drawing blood and see
[148.08 - 153.12] subtle differences that can be very
[150.44 - 155.96] helpful through those blood tests with
[153.12 - 159.48] that said we have a bigger problem the
[155.96 - 161.80] medical system has gone unchecked no
[159.48 - 164.32] one's questioned it and it's one of the
[161.80 - 168.80] biggest scams of our modern day Health
[164.32 - 172.64] System it's modernday blood leing the
[168.80 - 176.32] draining of our blood on a level that's
[172.64 - 178.80] unprecedented and unneeded every time
[176.32 - 181.16] you get a blood test and you see those
[178.80 - 184.08] pretty little tues tubes fill up with
[181.16 - 187.48] red blood right before your eyes there's
[184.08 - 189.72] a few things that are terribly wrong
[187.48 - 193.20] first thing is they're going to throw
[189.72 - 197.00] all that beautiful blood away in the
[193.20 - 201.60] garbage almost all of it or preserve it
[197.00 - 204.20] not for you but for who knows second of
[201.60 - 205.48] all the blood you see in those tubes has
[204.20 - 209.08] your hard-earned
[205.48 - 210.48] systematically produced body's precious
[209.08 - 215.00] resource
[210.48 - 217.84] sacred protection and health Shield your
[215.00 - 221.04] immune cells your white count your
[217.84 - 224.56] killer cells your white blood cells they
[221.04 - 227.44] go into the tubes see you later
[224.56 - 230.08] alligator bye-bye Miss American Pie
[227.44 - 234.44] drove my Chevy to the levy and the levy
[230.08 - 237.72] went dry you lost your immune system it
[234.44 - 239.84] went out the window not all your immune
[237.72 - 242.60] system left your body and went out the
[239.84 - 246.40] window but depending on how much blood
[242.60 - 249.60] was drawn a large part of the most
[246.40 - 252.52] important part of your immune system the
[249.60 - 256.20] weight count that patrols your
[252.52 - 258.72] bloodstream has left the house as you're
[256.20 - 262.28] walking away from your doctor's
[258.72 - 264.92] appointment less full and more
[262.28 - 267.80] empty sometimes you're told to drink a
[264.92 - 270.20] little apple juice have a cookie you'll
[267.80 - 273.72] build your blood back quick they say if
[270.20 - 276.48] they say anything at all that's reckless
[273.72 - 280.68] a reckless statement and a ridiculous
[276.48 - 284.68] one if we're all about science specifics
[280.68 - 288.28] details truth facts then this is the
[284.68 - 291.72] most blatant negligent careless process
[288.28 - 294.64] we have to date what do you mean build
[291.72 - 297.88] back your blood quickly the variables
[294.64 - 300.36] range on all levels how much blood was
[297.88 - 304.48] drawn how weak is your immune system to
[300.36 - 307.84] begin with how chronically ill are you
[304.48 - 311.24] what kind of symptoms do you live with
[307.84 - 314.52] what kind of Demands stress and load is
[311.24 - 318.12] on your plate or your life what's your
[314.52 - 321.60] diet like are you a man or are you a
[318.12 - 324.60] woman and when was the last time you had
[321.60 - 326.80] a blood draw it's not as simple as
[324.60 - 329.56] you'll be fine eat enough food and
[326.80 - 332.80] you'll level out you're lucky if the
[329.56 - 336.04] even give you a tip to eat the system
[332.80 - 339.20] will never get its thirst quenched they
[336.04 - 341.48] will bleed you to death steal your blood
[339.20 - 346.00] shorten your life by weakening your
[341.48 - 348.92] reserves and never ever ever be held
[346.00 - 350.76] accountable for it you might hold them
[348.92 - 353.52] accountable after you hear what you're
[350.76 - 356.64] about to hear you wake up with your
[353.52 - 359.96] first symptoms you start Doctor shopping
[356.64 - 362.32] like so many do and they take your your
[359.96 - 365.24] blood no one knows why you're really
[362.32 - 367.76] sick it's mostly low-grade viral
[365.24 - 369.56] infections and toxic heavy metals like
[367.76 - 372.24] I've always said causing your future
[369.56 - 374.92] diagnoses you're autoimmune at your
[372.24 - 378.92] doctor's office when they take your
[374.92 - 385.56] blood how much blood are they drawing is
[378.92 - 389.84] it four vials five vials s 10 14 18 24
[385.56 - 394.68] 28 more let's say they take five vials
[389.84 - 397.16] those are five full vials in that blood
[394.68 - 400.56] is your immune system and your immune
[397.16 - 403.68] system took time to build it's keeping
[400.56 - 406.60] you from getting sicker it's patrolling
[403.68 - 409.88] your body looking for Invaders looking
[406.60 - 412.76] for pathogens and even toxins and doing
[409.88 - 415.44] their job gobbling them up when they see
[412.76 - 418.40] them those toxins and Invaders are
[415.44 - 419.96] mostly why you're at the doctor's office
[418.40 - 424.00] Hashimoto's
[419.96 - 428.80] fibromyalgia ra multiple sclerosis lupus
[424.00 - 431.48] eczema psoriasis acne rosacea Vitiligo
[428.80 - 434.36] dizziness tingles and numbness like so
[431.48 - 436.52] many have fatigue especially that
[434.36 - 438.68] neurological fatigue people get where
[436.52 - 440.92] they just can't even walk and they don't
[438.68 - 445.04] even feel like they're living their life
[440.92 - 448.20] brain fog depression anxiety loss of
[445.04 - 450.88] libido body pain neck pain back pain
[448.20 - 455.04] hives asthma heart palpitations cold
[450.88 - 458.48] sores TMJ trigeminal neuralgia back pain
[455.04 - 459.88] migraines colitis digestive problems IBS
[458.48 - 463.00] Crohn's
[459.88 - 466.36] bloating caused by all these Invaders
[463.00 - 469.76] and toxins that are inside our blood so
[466.36 - 473.04] as they draw blood they're taking away
[469.76 - 476.16] your offense and defense at the same
[473.04 - 479.88] time that would probably be somewhat
[476.16 - 484.60] okay acceptable if they didn't almost
[479.88 - 487.76] throw all of your blood away but they do
[484.60 - 490.68] they take a few drops at best a thimble
[487.76 - 495.56] and toss the rest out to toss it
[490.68 - 498.84] somewhere you go home and it takes weeks
[495.56 - 502.52] even months to get that CBC that
[498.84 - 504.92] complete blood count back to normal
[502.52 - 507.40] white blood cells red blood cells
[504.92 - 509.84] platelets but most importantly that
[507.40 - 512.72] white blood count decide
[509.84 - 515.80] the condition you are going to be in
[512.72 - 518.68] with your symptoms and conditions no
[515.80 - 521.56] one's aware or monitoring if they should
[518.68 - 524.52] be careful with how much blood they draw
[521.56 - 527.56] from you at any given time you could be
[524.52 - 529.28] someone with a compromised immune system
[527.56 - 532.84] meaning your white blood cells are
[529.28 - 535.08] weakened low in numbers or on the edge
[532.84 - 538.48] so your doctor is supposed to be
[535.08 - 542.16] cautious keep your vials two or three
[538.48 - 545.16] max if sensitive and maybe for max if
[542.16 - 547.92] you're stronger and really it should be
[545.16 - 551.72] half vials going to talk more about that
[547.92 - 554.64] later but your doctor they're not taught
[551.72 - 557.44] by the industry your doctor's boss the
[554.64 - 560.88] industry that your immune system gets
[557.44 - 564.28] taken out of your body with your blood
[560.88 - 568.68] goes unused and is destroyed thrown out
[564.28 - 571.08] thrown away or Worse stored somewhere
[568.68 - 573.68] you may someone that doesn't build their
[571.08 - 576.96] immune system back quicker than others
[573.68 - 578.64] so instead of it taking four to 6 weeks
[576.96 - 581.80] just to get your white blood cells
[578.64 - 584.88] stabilized it takes four months and your
[581.80 - 588.52] red blood cells instead of 3 months 6
[584.88 - 591.44] months during this course of time your
[588.52 - 595.16] symptoms can worsen it prompts you to
[591.44 - 599.24] call the doctor again he's concerned so
[595.16 - 603.32] he draws more blood this time he may
[599.24 - 607.16] draw five to 10 vials wants to look for
[603.32 - 609.92] additional problems uncover the mystery
[607.16 - 613.36] you go home two weeks later your
[609.92 - 616.92] symptoms persist and it's even worse
[613.36 - 619.08] your doctor recommends a specialist your
[616.92 - 621.20] specialist he doesn't care about the
[619.08 - 624.72] blood work you had in the past most of
[621.20 - 627.76] the time they never do he or she wants
[624.72 - 630.92] to order their own blood work they may
[627.76 - 635.92] want another five vials but they can
[630.92 - 637.92] also maybe want another 14 vials or more
[635.92 - 640.80] while they're busy looking at all your
[637.92 - 644.00] numbers metabolic panel thyroid panel
[640.80 - 645.84] your liver enzymes you're struggling now

[666.80 - 675.20] giant blood bag a feeder for the system
[670.76 - 677.80] the system that's broken your specialist

[677.80 - 684.92] need another 7 to 14 vials they won't
[681.72 - 687.56] tell you you need another 7 to 14 vials
[684.92 - 689.60] it's just that when they stick you and
[687.56 - 691.48] they're putting another tube in taking a
[689.60 - 692.72] tube out put another tube in taking a
[691.48 - 694.96] tube out wait a minute where's this

[739.16 - 744.16] most god-given things you got inside
[741.48 - 747.96] your body that stops you from getting
[744.16 - 750.36] sicker your immune system they take it
[747.96 - 753.84] and they're throwing it out out this all
[750.36 - 756.24] too often happens to a lot of people
[753.84 - 760.88] some people this just takes them
[756.24 - 763.44] completely down bedridden for years some
[760.88 - 767.16] over time it just ends their life
[763.44 - 770.00] earlier they were blood L it to death
[767.16 - 773.48] blood let it and the sicker you get they
[770.00 - 776.44] draw more and more blood you get sicker
[773.48 - 779.40] they take more blood 6 months later
[776.44 - 782.40] you're sicker they take more blood
[779.40 - 784.76] and they don't stop till you drop say
[782.40 - 787.32] you're someone who's not sick and you
[784.76 - 790.36] get your routine blood tests you get
[787.32 - 792.84] five to seven vials every 6 months you
[790.36 - 796.04] might be someone that's lucky you don't
[792.84 - 799.52] have an Epstein bar shingles virus
[796.04 - 801.64] simplex cega virus hhv6
[799.52 - 804.28] hhv7 two or three strains of
[801.64 - 805.88] streptococus bacteria that's about to
[804.28 - 809.08] increase in numbers and give you your
[805.88 - 812.56] first symptoms but the blood draw will
[809.08 - 815.08] get you there quicker which means if
[812.56 - 817.52] your viruses and bacteria were
[815.08 - 821.88] designated to cause a problem when you
[817.52 - 825.68] are 55 years old weight gain more acne
[821.88 - 828.52] more problems fatigue the blood draws
[825.68 - 830.60] combined with not the best food choices
[828.52 - 832.32] and other factors your immune system
[830.60 - 835.24] might get low at certain times in your
[832.32 - 838.80] life it's going to happen when you're 35
[835.24 - 841.88] not 55 your routine blood draw will
[838.80 - 844.40] knock you slowly down as the years go by
[841.88 - 847.44] and get you a symptom or a condition
[844.40 - 850.84] sooner than it would have been and when
[847.44 - 854.56] it does you'll be required to give more
[850.84 - 857.44] blood and end up in the vampires Lair
[854.56 - 860.56] now you're in everyone who gets a blood
[857.44 - 863.56] draw walks around with a weakened immune
[860.56 - 868.80] system and now you're exposed to the bad
[863.56 - 871.56] flu covid mono strep staff Mera eoli
[868.80 - 874.56] food poisoning shingles or anything else

[885.32 - 890.56] entire immune system practically stay
[887.32 - 893.36] safe no one says that if you're lucky
[890.56 - 896.16] after a large blood draw they may say
[893.36 - 899.60] have a piece of candy a lollipop some
[896.16 - 901.96] orange juice or apple juice or a cookie
[899.60 - 904.72] and don't worry see you
[901.96 - 908.56] later it's not anyone's fault at the
[904.72 - 911.56] bottom this is a deception from the top
[908.56 - 914.08] it's not the FLOTUS it's not the nurses
[911.56 - 917.08] it's bigger than everyone it's big
[914.08 - 921.16] Pharma and the handful of people at the
[917.08 - 924.20] top with a mission to drain your blood
[921.16 - 928.00] you don't believe me you know then why
[924.20 - 930.64] else are they doing it because they made
[928.00 - 933.92] a simple mistake or something someone
[930.64 - 937.40] didn't get a memo nothing was fixed no
[933.92 - 940.60] one thought about it if it's not on
[937.40 - 943.44] purpose then it shows you that stupidity
[940.60 - 945.24] controls the top of the medical system
[943.44 - 947.20] you should bite your tongue next time
[945.24 - 950.44] you think science knows everything and
[947.20 - 953.32] has your back then it's Reckless Twisted
[950.44 - 956.40] horrifying and downright demonic harsh
[953.32 - 958.84] words you have no idea how many people
[956.40 - 961.64] have died from getting blood testing
[958.84 - 964.80] while living with chronic illness died
[961.64 - 967.88] early in their life so let's talk about
[964.80 - 970.08] cancer whether you believe in the truth
[967.88 - 973.08] that cancer is caused by viruses and
[970.08 - 975.44] toxins or you just think cancer is
[973.08 - 978.60] genetic you still need your immune
[975.44 - 980.92] system to keep your cancer in check your
[978.60 - 982.80] white count controls your cancer your
[980.92 - 985.48] white count gobbles up and destroys
[982.80 - 988.16] cancer cells and most importantly
[985.48 - 990.96] gobbles up the viruses that create
[988.16 - 993.96] cancer cells you get diagnosed with
[990.96 - 996.52] cancer most likely you've already had
[993.96 - 998.80] symptoms and conditions you've been sick
[996.52 - 1001.28] already and you've had enough blood
[998.80 - 1004.36] draws previously knocking your immune
[1001.28 - 1006.96] system down prior to your cancer
[1004.36 - 1009.36] diagnosis or your blood draws started
[1006.96 - 1012.72] right with your cancer diagnosis either
[1009.36 - 1016.04] way they step up your blood draws you go
[1012.72 - 1018.20] into rapid routine blood testing this
[1016.04 - 1021.20] puts a constant drain on your immune
[1018.20 - 1023.88] system system the one thing keeping you
[1021.20 - 1026.64] from worsening think the cancer doctor
[1023.88 - 1030.40] will mention anything no take blood at
[1026.64 - 1033.56] will take no hostages and ignore any
[1030.40 - 1036.24] Common Sense sensibility any reason or
[1033.56 - 1039.44] reasoning your white count lives inside
[1036.24 - 1041.80] of you in your blood for the most part
[1039.44 - 1043.28] it's tragic when it has to leave its
[1041.80 - 1045.60] home un
[1043.28 - 1048.60] necessarily the sicker you get as a
[1045.60 - 1050.80] cancer patient the more blood they take
[1048.60 - 1054.64] the sicker you get the more blood they
[1050.80 - 1056.72] take they drain you dry it's
[1054.64 - 1059.84] devastating look if you have the
[1056.72 - 1062.72] opportunity in the truth you have to use
[1059.84 - 1065.80] that to keep people safe healthy and
[1062.72 - 1069.80] alive I can see it now a lot of unhappy
[1065.80 - 1072.68] doctors Specialists blood Labs what an
[1069.80 - 1075.36] inconvenience this next bomb is as it
[1072.68 - 1079.16] leaves the medical medium Cannon and
[1075.36 - 1082.40] causes a crater in the broken health
[1079.16 - 1085.64] system when the people find out they've
[1082.40 - 1090.92] been screwed over they know they've been
[1085.64 - 1094.16] screwed over big time see blood letting
[1090.92 - 1098.04] never went away let's go back in time a
[1094.16 - 1102.60] little bit 1600s 1700s 1800s you got
[1098.04 - 1105.68] sick they cut your arm you drain into a
[1102.60 - 1109.16] pan if you didn't recover from whatever
[1105.68 - 1113.56] you were sick with they cut your arm
[1109.16 - 1115.76] again and drain it into a pan you still
[1113.56 - 1120.16] haven't recovered you're not one of the
[1115.76 - 1124.24] lucky ones they cut your arm again drain
[1120.16 - 1127.52] it in a pan and now you're
[1124.24 - 1131.20] finished why is this much different than
[1127.52 - 1134.24] today because it's not it's conventional
[1131.20 - 1137.12] medicine's finest f up that of course
[1134.24 - 1139.88] alternative medicine adopted as well CU
[1137.12 - 1142.56] alternative medicine always adopts all
[1139.88 - 1144.00] the conventional medicine fups they
[1142.56 - 1146.64] don't know what's wrong with you with
[1144.00 - 1149.00] chronic illness so they draw your blood
[1146.64 - 1151.04] draw your blood keep drawing your blood
[1149.00 - 1152.60] drawing your blood again draw it again
[1151.04 - 1155.04] oh need more Blood let's draw it more
[1152.60 - 1157.68] and more hey by the way you guys you got
[1155.04 - 1159.36] to get more blood drawn and then hey we
[1157.68 - 1161.24] need your blood get back in here got to
[1159.36 - 1164.76] draw some more blood and throw it all
[1161.24 - 1167.20] away you get sicker they draw more blood
[1164.76 - 1171.16] and throw it away they don't drain it in
[1167.20 - 1175.20] a pan but still you get sicker a
[1171.16 - 1178.20] specialist will draw 7 to 28 vials and
[1175.20 - 1181.16] throw it away you got a better chance of
[1178.20 - 1184.40] living through it than a 100 years ago
[1181.16 - 1187.56] than 200 300 400 years ago because we
[1184.40 - 1190.72] have resources to help stabilize us at
[1187.56 - 1193.08] our fingertips right we got still some
[1190.72 - 1195.00] good medical technology I won't say we
[1193.08 - 1197.00] don't we really do and that's the
[1195.00 - 1200.44] difference back then they just laid in a
[1197.00 - 1202.76] bed blood Le with no water for days
[1200.44 - 1205.88] terrible environmental conditions
[1202.76 - 1207.88] shortages on food no proper blankets no
[1205.88 - 1211.64] IVs to support their organs while their
[1207.88 - 1215.32] blood was being removed no oxygen tanks
[1211.64 - 1217.60] but it's still all the same the handful
[1215.32 - 1220.64] of people at the top of the Medical
[1217.60 - 1223.68] Science and the medical industry carried
[1220.64 - 1226.64] blood leing all the way over to the
[1223.68 - 1230.20] heads of the medical industry now it's
[1226.64 - 1232.92] still the same but it's done differently
[1230.20 - 1235.36] you might be someone thinking no way I
[1232.92 - 1238.60] get my blood work I'm fine yeah I got a
[1235.36 - 1240.68] little acne my doctor checks my hormones
[1238.60 - 1243.36] I'm doing good after my blood work this
[1240.68 - 1245.52] is not me or maybe you're someone that
[1243.36 - 1248.76] gets your thyroid checked after 6 to8
[1245.52 - 1251.24] weeks or every 6 to8 weeks or every 3
[1248.76 - 1253.88] months you're doing okay maybe you're
[1251.24 - 1256.44] someone diagnosed with sibo got a little
[1253.88 - 1258.28] eczema your routine blood draws seem
[1256.44 - 1261.64] normal maybe you're someone with with
[1258.28 - 1264.80] Celiac everything seems to be up to par
[1261.64 - 1268.20] your symptoms or conditions come and go
[1264.80 - 1270.92] you get your blood work everything seems
[1268.20 - 1274.08] okay or maybe you're someone your
[1270.92 - 1277.36] symptoms are on an even kill you're
[1274.08 - 1281.04] eating better taking supplements and all
[1277.36 - 1284.56] this seems a little farfetched but
[1281.04 - 1287.36] little do you know you're still getting
[1284.56 - 1289.64] a hunk of your immune system removed and
[1287.36 - 1292.36] you have a lot lot of years ahead of you
[1289.64 - 1295.68] for things to go wrong because of it it
[1292.36 - 1297.72] happens when you least expect it at the
[1295.68 - 1300.52] worst moments in life too you're
[1297.72 - 1302.24] coasting along everything's going okay
[1300.52 - 1305.52] you're used to your symptoms here and
[1302.24 - 1308.28] there but then comes that one blood draw
[1305.52 - 1311.52] that pushes you too far and knocks you
[1308.28 - 1314.72] on your ass you're dysfunctional
[1311.52 - 1316.68] fatigued brain fogged can't think right
[1314.72 - 1318.28] a little dizzy and now you think it's
[1316.68 - 1320.00] something in your diet wait AE minut
[1318.28 - 1322.20] it's something I'm doing that's what
[1320.00 - 1324.60] it's got to be my diet maybe it's this
[1322.20 - 1326.76] thing I took uh maybe it's something
[1324.60 - 1329.24] else you're checking your supplements
[1326.76 - 1332.80] but you have no clue it was your last
[1329.24 - 1336.04] big blood draw even if it was weeks ago
[1332.80 - 1338.72] or even months ago it was the blood draw
[1336.04 - 1342.16] that pushed you over the edge it was the
[1338.72 - 1344.64] straw that broke the camel's back before
[1342.16 - 1347.24] that you had a strong Constitution you
[1344.64 - 1349.68] weren't that sick you might be still
[1347.24 - 1352.00] young you're you're in your 20s and it
[1349.68 - 1355.20] sneaks up behind you and bites you on
[1352.00 - 1357.44] the ankle like a snake and you're up 10
[1355.20 - 1360.52] notches with your symptoms and you're
[1357.44 - 1363.24] down 10 notches with your health and the
[1360.52 - 1366.04] confusion of why you're getting worse
[1363.24 - 1368.12] only gets worse and now it's the
[1366.04 - 1371.24] guessing games time the real guessing
[1368.12 - 1374.16] games not the mini guessing games the
[1371.24 - 1376.96] major big guessing games more than ever
[1374.16 - 1380.84] before and once you burned out your most
[1376.96 - 1383.28] recent doctor or he or she Burns you out
[1380.84 - 1387.24] it's off to another doctor and more
[1383.28 - 1389.20] fresh blood work and suggestions such as
[1387.24 - 1391.72] did you try apple cider vinegar that
[1389.20 - 1394.04] might help are you doing your charcoal
[1391.72 - 1396.28] um yeah no keto that could be a good
[1394.04 - 1398.52] direction to go uh paleo how's that
[1396.28 - 1400.16] working for you is that a good way to go
[1398.52 - 1402.16] are you getting your healthy fats CU
[1400.16 - 1404.80] your brain needs all that fat are you
[1402.16 - 1406.92] staying away from sugar and carbs are
[1404.80 - 1408.96] you getting your fermented foods in are
[1406.92 - 1411.44] you doing your probiotic iotics the
[1408.96 - 1414.72] confusion goes on and it Carries On and
[1411.44 - 1416.76] On you become fresh meat fresh meat
[1414.72 - 1419.76] walking into that doctor specialist
[1416.76 - 1422.12] office or the meat market you're a fresh
[1419.76 - 1425.36] feeder happens to everybody with blood
[1422.12 - 1428.72] draws over time there's a trend out
[1425.36 - 1430.96] there not backed by any science just a
[1428.72 - 1433.64] theory and the theory is becoming the
[1430.96 - 1437.04] mantra for all alternative doctors and
[1433.64 - 1438.48] practitioners it's your immune system is
[1437.04 - 1440.80] all in your gut
[1438.48 - 1443.56] heard that one yet that's a head
[1440.80 - 1446.08] scratcher for me how can anybody trust
[1443.56 - 1449.00] this since all practitioners and doctors
[1446.08 - 1451.44] blood let everybody to begin with
[1449.00 - 1454.60] they're wrong about the most important
[1451.44 - 1457.00] aspects of medicine there is possible
[1454.60 - 1459.84] the one they rely on the most for
[1457.00 - 1462.76] answers your precious blood work and
[1459.84 - 1466.96] blood supply but now they're right about
[1462.76 - 1469.16] this your gut all your immune systems
[1466.96 - 1471.64] working in your gut your entire immune
[1469.16 - 1474.72] system is in your gut uh most of your
[1471.64 - 1477.08] immune system is is in your gut do you
[1474.72 - 1479.40] know where that came from it came from
[1477.08 - 1482.12] probiotic and gut health companies
[1479.40 - 1485.28] that's who came up with that theory uh
[1482.12 - 1487.72] bias information anyone I hate to break
[1485.28 - 1490.28] it to them but the majority of your
[1487.72 - 1493.12] immune system is in your
[1490.28 - 1496.04] bloodstream it's in your bloodstream to
[1493.12 - 1498.80] protect your brain and your heart it's
[1496.04 - 1501.72] in your bloodstream to try to stop
[1498.80 - 1504.84] pathogens from going to your brain and
[1501.72 - 1507.68] causing strokes and brain inflammation
[1504.84 - 1511.20] it's in your blood stream to try to stop
[1507.68 - 1513.88] pathogens from getting to your heart and
[1511.20 - 1517.20] causing a blood clot or inflammation of
[1513.88 - 1520.64] the ventricles it's in your bloodstream
[1517.20 - 1523.44] to stop sepsis or blood poisoning or an
[1520.64 - 1526.24] infection to your heart valve it's not
[1523.44 - 1529.96] in your gut yes some of your immune
[1526.24 - 1533.20] system is but the majority is in your
[1529.96 - 1536.60] bloodstream your brain and heart are
[1533.20 - 1541.00] Target number one for the enemy and both
[1536.60 - 1543.80] are VIP to your immune system your heart
[1541.00 - 1546.56] your brain are the VIPs to your immune
[1543.80 - 1549.72] system but that's how misinformation
[1546.56 - 1551.92] Trends are it's all in your gut immune
[1549.72 - 1555.24] systems all in your gut just like they
[1551.92 - 1557.00] said it's all in your head and then also
[1555.24 - 1558.84] caffeine is good for you they say that
[1557.00 - 1560.24] too it's good for pregnant women that's
[1558.84 - 1564.20] what they say
[1560.24 - 1567.12] now really or plunging in ice is good
[1564.20 - 1571.16] for the body puts you in shock kills
[1567.12 - 1573.44] your adrenals gives you mild hypothermia
[1571.16 - 1575.92] but no it's good for your body uh how
[1573.44 - 1578.76] about this when your brain lives on fat
[1575.92 - 1581.80] oh really uh is that why they tell you
[1578.76 - 1583.28] to eat sugar drink apple juice after you
[1581.80 - 1587.36] donated
[1583.28 - 1591.04] blood because someone at the top knows
[1587.36 - 1594.12] if they don't give you sugar after they
[1591.04 - 1596.28] theft at your blood you ain't walking
[1594.12 - 1599.72] out of that blood donor's clinic or
[1596.28 - 1601.72] doctor's office they don't say hey um
[1599.72 - 1603.88] you just donated a pint your blood
[1601.72 - 1606.12] here's a cup of coconut oil or here's a
[1603.88 - 1609.16] cup of olive oil that's because your
[1606.12 - 1611.68] brain is hungry it's hungry for sugar if
[1609.16 - 1614.92] it goes without glucose for more than 5
[1611.68 - 1617.12] minutes it starts to die but yet the
[1614.92 - 1619.92] trend is to tell you your brain runs on
[1617.12 - 1623.16] fat which contradicts what they tell you
[1619.92 - 1625.96] after you've given blood who's right
[1623.16 - 1629.32] who's wrong well next time you donate a
[1625.96 - 1631.52] pint of blood or get a big blood draw
[1629.32 - 1633.40] drink a cup of oil or eat a few
[1631.52 - 1635.64] tablespoons of peanut butter and see if
[1633.40 - 1638.36] you hit the sidewalk face down walking
[1635.64 - 1640.28] out of there and if you're compromised
[1638.36 - 1643.16] sensitive or sick with symptoms you'll
[1640.28 - 1645.64] hit the sidewalk faster and harder but I
[1643.16 - 1648.80] wouldn't do it because you need more
[1645.64 - 1651.16] glucose for stabilization after having a
[1648.80 - 1654.08] good amount of glucose removed from your
[1651.16 - 1657.32] blood you remove the glucose you better
[1654.08 - 1660.20] be putting some back in your sugar your
[1657.32 - 1664.00] blood sugar as they're taking too much
[1660.20 - 1667.48] blood from you they also took your
[1664.00 - 1669.84] glucose not just your immune system when
[1667.48 - 1673.60] you got your blood drawn the glucose
[1669.84 - 1676.44] that keeps your brain alive which leads
[1673.60 - 1678.24] to the next problem they not only drain
[1676.44 - 1680.32] you of your immune system but they drain
[1678.24 - 1683.80] you of your glucose reserves which for
[1680.32 - 1686.56] the chronically ill means everything
[1683.80 - 1690.40] neurological problems and symptoms that
[1686.56 - 1693.24] The Chronic Leo have do worsen with the
[1690.40 - 1696.48] loss of glucose and they take that away
[1693.24 - 1698.76] from you too your blood sugar there's a
[1696.48 - 1702.36] reason they measure blood sugar not
[1698.76 - 1705.08] blood fat you can live without fat you
[1702.36 - 1707.96] can't live without sugar the trendy
[1705.08 - 1710.84] Health gurus think it's fat
[1707.96 - 1713.12] that's real smart but hey they think all
[1710.84 - 1716.36] your blood draws blood work blood tests
[1713.12 - 1721.08] and how it's done is great normal F to
[1716.36 - 1723.88] do until they hear this podcast and then
[1721.08 - 1725.68] maybe start copycatting but they also
[1723.88 - 1728.64] think your immune system's all in your
[1725.68 - 1730.16] gut and many gurus think you're sick
[1728.64 - 1732.60] because you haven't trained your neurop
[1730.16 - 1734.96] Pathways to manifest your sickness to go
[1732.60 - 1737.80] away because it's all in your head yeah
[1734.96 - 1740.48] I love that one you know as if if your
[1737.80 - 1742.08] mind is going to reverse the trauma the
[1740.48 - 1744.72] physical trauma that's caused by
[1742.08 - 1748.32] constantly getting your blood drawn yeah
[1744.72 - 1751.44] okay okay every time they do a blood
[1748.32 - 1753.76] draw your white count and red count go
[1751.44 - 1758.36] out the door and whatever's making you
[1753.76 - 1761.16] sick stays inside pathogens like viruses
[1758.36 - 1763.80] such as Epstein bar the very bug behind
[1761.16 - 1766.64] Hashimoto thyroiditis Lyme disease
[1763.80 - 1770.04] multiple sclerosis lupus eczema Celiac
[1766.64 - 1773.28] PCOS fibroids endometriosis stays in
[1770.04 - 1775.56] your body because these Critters are not
[1773.28 - 1777.84] in your bloodstream for the most part
[1775.56 - 1780.68] that's why it's nearly impossible with
[1777.84 - 1783.88] the blood testing they have now to find
[1780.68 - 1787.00] active Epstein bar it's not a fullblown
[1783.88 - 1790.76] infection in your bloodstream they're in
[1787.00 - 1794.56] your organs glands and tissue where they
[1790.76 - 1796.84] can survive your immune system and hide
[1794.56 - 1799.60] and when your immune system is strong a
[1796.84 - 1803.08] white blood blood cell sees an Epstein
[1799.60 - 1806.44] bar virus Peaks its ugly head out of an
[1803.08 - 1809.96] organ your killer cell Stomps on it and
[1806.44 - 1813.20] destroys it but after a blood draw a lot
[1809.96 - 1815.64] of your killer cells went bye-bye and
[1813.20 - 1819.72] that Epstein bar Peaks its head out and
[1815.64 - 1821.40] says I'm in the clear time to spread you
[1819.72 - 1823.88] would think if your immune system's
[1821.40 - 1827.00] being drawn out with your blood that
[1823.88 - 1830.32] your pathogens would be drawn out and go
[1827.00 - 1832.48] with it but they don't your blood cells
[1830.32 - 1835.68] white count killer cells guard your
[1832.48 - 1838.36] brain and heart making sure that Epstein
[1835.68 - 1841.04] bar or any other pathogen doesn't get a
[1838.36 - 1844.16] tollfree ride through your blood Highway
[1841.04 - 1846.44] making a pit stop to another organ I
[1844.16 - 1849.56] can't tell you how many times I
[1846.44 - 1852.72] witnessed so many people get fullblown
[1849.56 - 1855.28] mono after a blood draw because an
[1852.72 - 1857.84] important portion of the immune system
[1855.28 - 1860.80] that's inside their bloodstream has been
[1857.84 - 1864.36] removed people get the flu after a blood
[1860.80 - 1867.12] draw or any other bug going around
[1864.36 - 1869.28] you're more susceptible or they get more
[1867.12 - 1872.40] symptoms of what they're already
[1869.28 - 1875.16] battling because pathogens travel when
[1872.40 - 1877.96] they're not being controlled that's why
[1875.16 - 1881.44] the immune system in your bloodstream is
[1877.96 - 1884.24] so important but up until medical medium
[1881.44 - 1886.64] information no one knew pathogens caused
[1884.24 - 1888.80] any chronic illness just like they don't
[1886.64 - 1891.64] know about the blood draw problem
[1888.80 - 1893.92] Chinese medicine was unaware atic
[1891.64 - 1896.24] medicine didn't know science and
[1893.92 - 1898.64] research didn't know the vegans didn't
[1896.24 - 1901.64] know the paleos didn't know Western
[1898.64 - 1904.12] alternative medicine didn't know now
[1901.64 - 1906.64] Doctors medical research and science are
[1904.12 - 1909.36] using medical medium information that
[1906.64 - 1913.24] Epstein bar is responsible or even
[1909.36 - 1916.12] linked to a host of diseases after it
[1913.24 - 1918.64] was already published but oh yeah
[1916.12 - 1920.80] where's your science well science has
[1918.64 - 1923.60] taken medical medium information
[1920.80 - 1927.04] plagiarizing it and using it now leads
[1923.60 - 1930.12] me to another critical point anyone
[1927.04 - 1933.88] who's sick with any neurological symptom
[1930.12 - 1936.88] brain fog depression anxiety bipolar
[1933.88 - 1941.12] aches and pains Twitches spasms ticks
[1936.88 - 1943.12] jerks chronic fatigue sleep apnea asthma
[1941.12 - 1945.52] migraines jaw pain tingles and numbness
[1943.12 - 1948.40] vertigo ttis burning skin weakness of
[1945.52 - 1952.12] the limbs tightness of the chest needs
[1948.40 - 1954.36] needs needs electrolytes and a large
[1952.12 - 1957.68] amount of your electrolytes are in your
[1954.36 - 1960.80] blood as it leaves your body during a
[1957.68 - 1963.48] blood draw we get in trouble and then
[1960.80 - 1966.44] your brain your neurons and your
[1963.48 - 1968.72] neurotransmitters get hit hard and lose
[1966.44 - 1971.80] those critically needed Trace mineral
[1968.72 - 1974.80] salts and electrolytes this isn't even
[1971.80 - 1977.52] considered these blood draws the petus
[1974.80 - 1980.36] of deep-seated electrolyte Reserves no
[1977.52 - 1983.52] one's checking that no one's caring no
[1980.36 - 1986.08] one's talking about it no one even knows
[1983.52 - 1987.76] your neurological symptoms worsen but
[1986.08 - 1990.52] that won't take the blame the last blood
[1987.76 - 1993.36] draw you call your doctor you're feeling
[1990.52 - 1995.84] worse weeks after your blood draw and he
[1993.36 - 1999.20] or she's going to need another blood
[1995.84 - 2002.52] draw and not even realize that you're in
[1999.20 - 2006.28] a glucose electrolyte and immune system
[2002.52 - 2008.88] deprivation from your last blood draw
[2006.28 - 2012.40] you know what the say bad thing is blood
[2008.88 - 2015.76] draws they Spike our adrenals too every
[2012.40 - 2018.36] time the needle goes in your arm ow or
[2015.76 - 2020.88] anywhere else in the body your adrenals
[2018.36 - 2023.44] release fight or flight
[2020.88 - 2027.24] epinephrine your adrenals react to a
[2023.44 - 2028.92] foreign Invader in this case the needle
[2027.24 - 2032.56] that adrenaline can power you through
[2028.92 - 2036.12] the blood test though it's a needle High
[2032.56 - 2038.56] keep in mind blood draws take from us
[2036.12 - 2041.48] it's not like an intravenous vitamin or
[2038.56 - 2044.72] saline bag that offers nourishment to
[2041.48 - 2047.88] counterbalance the adrenals during their
[2044.72 - 2050.68] fight or flight response this adrenaline
[2047.88 - 2052.72] response to the needle alone takes time
[2050.68 - 2055.48] to recover for people who are weakened
[2052.72 - 2058.96] in sick that calls for any needles or
[2055.48 - 2060.84] treatments with needles needles can also
[2058.96 - 2064.28] make you high from the adrenaline that's
[2060.84 - 2068.12] released the medical industry secretly
[2064.28 - 2071.92] relies on you getting this high from the
[2068.12 - 2073.96] pin prick it Band-Aids the moment the
[2071.92 - 2077.24] damage being done with too much blood
[2073.96 - 2080.04] being drawn some people feel a temporary
[2077.24 - 2083.68] lift like a temporary high as a needle
[2080.04 - 2087.64] leaves the arm before they feel worse
[2083.68 - 2090.80] later as the adrenaline surge wears off
[2087.64 - 2094.32] check this out if someone gets an injury
[2090.80 - 2097.84] and they get cut and they bleed two
[2094.32 - 2101.00] three or four vials of blood worth
[2097.84 - 2104.96] which is roughly around 40 m of blood F4
[2101.00 - 2107.60] vials with 10ml vials right they feel it
[2104.96 - 2111.52] they're traumatized can you imagine
[2107.60 - 2115.84] getting a blood draw of 14 vials even
[2111.52 - 2118.24] seven or 10 vials full vials or more
[2115.84 - 2122.12] which leads us to the next part
[2118.24 - 2125.28] hemorrhagic shock this is an under
[2122.12 - 2127.88] studied area and even if it was a
[2125.28 - 2131.88] heavily studied area it doesn't mean it
[2127.88 - 2134.28] would be solid understood Ironclad it
[2131.88 - 2137.24] could still end up as bad as cheap tin
[2134.28 - 2139.20] foil research and science is known for
[2137.24 - 2142.88] dedicating its resources to areas of
[2139.20 - 2144.64] medicine and failing miserably it's why
[2142.88 - 2146.96] they don't have any real answers for
[2144.64 - 2149.40] chronic illness except for oh yeah I
[2146.96 - 2151.28] forgot it's your genes it's all your
[2149.40 - 2154.44] genes that's the answer for everything
[2151.28 - 2156.48] now it's your jeans what a way out blame
[2154.44 - 2159.44] the person don't blame science and
[2156.48 - 2163.72] research CH it's your fault when it
[2159.44 - 2165.56] comes to blood loss they believe 750 mL
[2163.72 - 2169.24] of blood equates to a class one
[2165.56 - 2172.48] hemorrhagic shock but for what body
[2169.24 - 2176.24] weight I'm trying to figure that one out
[2172.48 - 2178.80] um what condition someone has and what
[2176.24 - 2179.84] body weight it's a heads scratcher again
[2178.80 - 2184.88] it's not
[2179.84 - 2189.16] studied what if you're 100 lb 750 ml
[2184.88 - 2194.16] could be extreme ragic shock to a person
[2189.16 - 2197.40] what if you're a 200 lb male and not 130
[2194.16 - 2200.84] lb woman what if you're sick chronically
[2197.40 - 2203.80] ill and 90 lbs like so many people who
[2200.84 - 2206.00] get their blood constantly drawn are no
[2203.80 - 2209.12] one in science and research are studying
[2206.00 - 2211.08] the details or seeing the reality and
[2209.12 - 2214.24] possibility of what kind of a effect
[2211.08 - 2216.84] this could have on sensitive people
[2214.24 - 2219.56] hemorrhagic shock is just a loss of
[2216.84 - 2222.68] blood which means less oxygen and sugar
[2219.56 - 2225.76] to the brain glucose but it means more
[2222.68 - 2228.68] than that it means subtle but definite
[2225.76 - 2231.20] shocks to other organs and when you lose
[2228.68 - 2235.00] your immune cells to a blood draw what
[2231.20 - 2237.52] about shock to your bones bone marrow
[2235.00 - 2240.48] has to go into rapid production and deep
[2237.52 - 2242.48] reserves are lost uh see you later Mrs
[2240.48 - 2245.60] Fergenson thanks for giving giving us
[2242.48 - 2247.96] all your blood today um hey look out
[2245.60 - 2250.20] your bones are going to have to go into
[2247.96 - 2251.84] a major workout there they're going to
[2250.20 - 2254.92] have to develop a whole bunch of immune
[2251.84 - 2257.08] cells fast as heck and uh you better
[2254.92 - 2260.16] rest because your bones are freaking out
[2257.08 - 2263.04] right now and when you're sick it's a
[2260.16 - 2265.64] lot to ask for on your body your immune
[2263.04 - 2269.12] systems already up against environmental
[2265.64 - 2272.64] toxins pharmaceutical toxins toxic heavy
[2269.12 - 2275.20] metals perfumes colon scented candles
[2272.64 - 2278.24] air fresheners those are immune system
[2275.20 - 2280.64] Busters smile car exhaust
[2278.24 - 2282.28] Chemtrails coming out of the sky you're
[2280.64 - 2284.36] breathing in when you go outside
[2282.28 - 2287.36] pesticides herbicides fungicides
[2284.36 - 2290.44] cleaning supplies detergents Cosmetics
[2287.36 - 2293.36] fire retardant coming out of couches and
[2290.44 - 2297.48] beds for Malahide leaking out of walls
[2293.36 - 2299.72] mold dust radiation everywhere gasoline
[2297.48 - 2303.44] petrochemicals Plastics and the biggest
[2299.72 - 2305.72] one pathogens so it's a big Demand right
[2303.44 - 2308.56] to call upon the bones in your body to
[2305.72 - 2310.96] go into Mass production of immune cells
[2308.56 - 2313.84] and to drain your spleen reserves of
[2310.96 - 2316.20] stored white count your bank your white
[2313.84 - 2318.84] blood count Bank you'll get told it's no
[2316.20 - 2320.56] big deal no big deal you got plenty of
[2318.84 - 2324.68] blood and your body will replenish it
[2320.56 - 2326.80] the next day there's no definitive scale
[2324.68 - 2329.16] that determines hemorrhagic shock
[2326.80 - 2332.48] there's no guarantee there's no
[2329.16 - 2334.60] guarantee it's perfect sloppy textbook
[2332.48 - 2339.16] jargon from the science department once
[2334.60 - 2342.00] again sloppy means careless understudied
[2339.16 - 2344.72] never considered it basically boils down
[2342.00 - 2347.68] to a phrase it's not enough blood to
[2344.72 - 2351.16] kill you so who cares so you should be
[2347.68 - 2353.88] good chalk it up we never tested their
[2351.16 - 2356.80] theory on people to prove what level of
[2353.88 - 2360.76] blood missing kills you we never did the
[2356.80 - 2363.60] Fine Line testing but I think something
[2360.76 - 2365.52] happened like 800 years ago someone
[2363.60 - 2367.20] signed up for the experiment they they
[2365.52 - 2370.88] walked into somebody
[2367.20 - 2372.56] office they cut him bled him to death
[2370.88 - 2376.20] and they calculated how much blood it
[2372.56 - 2378.92] was that's a long time ago what about
[2376.20 - 2381.32] the details we just assume that the
[2378.92 - 2384.24] people who have led to death lost around
[2381.32 - 2387.96] 40% which is roughly half gallon of
[2384.24 - 2391.60] blood well which is two quarts which is
[2387.96 - 2395.40] roughly 2,000 milliliters no variables
[2391.60 - 2399.88] no details no feline
[2395.40 - 2405.44] definitions pregnant or not pregnant man
[2399.88 - 2408.16] or woman thin or overweight healthy or
[2405.44 - 2411.56] sick total guess workor on hemorrhagic
[2408.16 - 2414.56] shock and how much blood it takes to die
[2411.56 - 2417.44] also lacking all information and details
[2414.56 - 2419.28] on what a healthy person versus someone
[2417.44 - 2422.16] who is struggling with a health
[2419.28 - 2425.00] condition of any kind with all the
[2422.16 - 2428.36] science and research and technology and
[2425.00 - 2433.88] factchecking and experts it's just a
[2428.36 - 2437.08] shot in the dark a dart thrown at a barn
[2433.88 - 2440.16] guess work the blood draw world is an
[2437.08 - 2444.08] empty void of solid facts and data and
[2440.16 - 2447.20] evidence and studies dead empty it's a
[2444.08 - 2450.52] classic example of a broken system and
[2447.20 - 2454.24] people lining up like paddle and sheeple
[2450.52 - 2456.68] without any reason to question it uh uh
[2454.24 - 2459.20] how much blood do you need um those
[2456.68 - 2461.16] tubes are filling up pretty quick I'm
[2459.20 - 2463.12] not supposed to question it right no
[2461.16 - 2466.20] don't question it ever you guys know
[2463.12 - 2468.12] what you're doing you know uh I had an
[2466.20 - 2470.52] uncle that knew how much antifreeze it
[2468.12 - 2472.64] took to take out of a radiator before
[2470.52 - 2474.60] the car overheated I figured you guys
[2472.64 - 2476.52] got to know way more than that and how
[2474.60 - 2479.44] much blood it takes without hurting me
[2476.52 - 2482.04] in any way uh what' you say come back
[2479.44 - 2485.00] next month okay we'll do it all again
[2482.04 - 2487.12] all right oh I'm done oh thanks oh I
[2485.00 - 2489.72] just had a dizzy spell
[2487.12 - 2492.28] the abusive nature of blood draw and its
[2489.72 - 2494.96] unnecessary consequences is a prime
[2492.28 - 2497.68] example of failure and even the best
[2494.96 - 2500.68] doctors and health experts walk around
[2497.68 - 2503.84] with a blood stain blindfold on let's
[2500.68 - 2508.08] talk about the Fine Line before you draw
[2503.84 - 2511.20] blood are you a female or a male women
[2508.08 - 2513.60] have a constant revolving immune system
[2511.20 - 2516.28] because they have the responsibility of
[2513.60 - 2519.12] childbearing continuing human life here
[2516.28 - 2521.48] here on Earth women's immune systems
[2519.12 - 2524.40] drop in the rest of their body when
[2521.48 - 2527.12] they're having their menstrual cycle 80%
[2524.40 - 2529.88] of their body's immune system go to the
[2527.12 - 2533.24] reproductive system to protect it during
[2529.88 - 2535.56] its shedding cycle 40% of a woman's
[2533.24 - 2539.04] immune system goes to
[2535.56 - 2542.40] ovulation 50% of their immune system
[2539.04 - 2546.28] goes to pregnancy in over 90% of their
[2542.40 - 2548.56] immune system during childbirth it's why
[2546.28 - 2551.12] women get symptoms or more symptoms
[2548.56 - 2553.20] around these timelines it's why more
[2551.12 - 2556.40] women are sick with chronic illness than
[2553.20 - 2558.40] men men's immune systems are steady they
[2556.40 - 2561.16] have this Advantage when it comes to
[2558.40 - 2564.08] health a man can burn their immune
[2561.16 - 2566.88] system to the ground yeah and destroy it
[2564.08 - 2569.44] many do but it's a steady burn as it
[2566.88 - 2572.36] crashes and goes to the ground if a man
[2569.44 - 2577.20] and a woman get blood drawn for the same
[2572.36 - 2579.36] problem on the same day the 220 PB male
[2577.20 - 2582.88] will get the same amount of blood drawn
[2579.36 - 2587.32] as the 120 lb woman if it's seven vials
[2582.88 - 2589.76] or 14 vials they both get the same same
[2587.32 - 2593.32] as if they both donated blood they both
[2589.76 - 2596.84] get roughly 473 Millers or one pite
[2593.32 - 2599.76] drawn regardless of their differences
[2596.84 - 2602.04] that's a huge problem an embarrassment
[2599.76 - 2604.64] for the medical system for research in
[2602.04 - 2607.60] science it's humiliating for medical
[2604.64 - 2610.00] research in science and people are being
[2607.60 - 2612.80] trained to believe medical research and
[2610.00 - 2615.60] science can do no wrong and that it's
[2612.80 - 2618.80] above God the light the universe
[2615.60 - 2621.84] whatever you believe in it's a cult at
[2618.80 - 2626.44] this point it's become a cult instead of
[2621.84 - 2629.36] what it should be or once was a work in
[2626.44 - 2632.92] progress that has left a trail of
[2629.36 - 2634.92] mistakes but perseveres forward let's
[2632.92 - 2637.76] talk about your immune system your
[2634.92 - 2640.48] immune system fights for you every day
[2637.76 - 2642.52] it's gobbling up mold spores poisons
[2640.48 - 2645.48] that float in the air other air
[2642.52 - 2647.68] contaminants or pathogens like the flu
[2645.48 - 2650.36] when a toxic mold Spore enters your
[2647.68 - 2654.24] bloodstream a white blood cell has to
[2650.36 - 2657.48] trap it and consume it gobble gobble it
[2654.24 - 2660.48] lessens the lifespan of that immune cell
[2657.48 - 2662.76] it weakens it let's talk about if you're
[2660.48 - 2664.52] eating out at a restaurant everybody
[2662.76 - 2667.88] loves to eat out in restaurants right
[2664.52 - 2670.52] it's fun get out enjoy the night or
[2667.88 - 2672.44] maybe a lunch out there's contaminants
[2670.52 - 2674.52] in the food that you're eating you're
[2672.44 - 2678.16] eating a sandwich from a restaurant
[2674.52 - 2681.04] breathing in perfume cologne aftershaves
[2678.16 - 2684.32] hair products scented body lotions and
[2681.04 - 2686.64] oils air fresheners and scented candles
[2684.32 - 2688.64] pesticides used for cockroaches and ants
[2686.64 - 2692.16] in the kitchen conventional floor
[2688.64 - 2694.08] cleaner table cleaner your plate has a
[2692.16 - 2696.72] little leftover bleach on it from the
[2694.08 - 2699.12] kitchen the waiter was just counting
[2696.72 - 2702.44] money before he or she brought over your
[2699.12 - 2704.76] plate the lettuce on your sandwich has a
[2702.44 - 2706.68] little eoli on it from some raw meat in
[2704.76 - 2709.00] the refrigerator that was sitting next
[2706.68 - 2711.36] to it the vinegar in your dressing
[2709.00 - 2713.60] that's a toxin all on its own coupled
[2711.36 - 2716.32] with some sweat drops that contained
[2713.60 - 2718.48] some staff or strep flew off the chef's
[2716.32 - 2720.84] head along with a little dander filled
[2718.48 - 2723.16] with liver toxins that you can't see on
[2720.84 - 2725.36] your slices of bread or your sandwich
[2723.16 - 2728.08] kitchen helpers in the back unpacking
[2725.36 - 2730.52] greasy boxes off the delivery truck and
[2728.08 - 2732.68] changing out the ice containers touching
[2730.52 - 2734.32] the ice and their unwashed hands we're
[2732.68 - 2736.76] touching everything in the kitchen
[2734.32 - 2738.48] including needing a bathroom stop in
[2736.76 - 2740.64] between it all loading boxes and then
[2738.48 - 2742.72] having to use the bathroom yeah did they
[2740.64 - 2744.52] wash your hands that good nobody knows
[2742.72 - 2746.52] they weren't in there with them any
[2744.52 - 2748.48] Airborne pathogen such as the flu that
[2746.52 - 2750.44] you might breathe in from everybody else
[2748.48 - 2753.44] being around in the restaurant your
[2750.44 - 2755.88] immune cells they're being poisoned
[2753.44 - 2758.44] poisoned fast because they have to
[2755.88 - 2761.72] gobble up as much of these chemicals
[2758.44 - 2764.08] contaminants and pathogens as they can
[2761.72 - 2765.76] in a short amount of time to protect you
[2764.08 - 2767.24] while you feel all good in the
[2765.76 - 2769.64] restaurant feeling okay eating your
[2767.24 - 2772.40] sandwich all is fine all is well an
[2769.64 - 2775.28] immune cell can get filled up quick
[2772.40 - 2778.56] filled up fast and it slows down
[2775.28 - 2783.04] sometimes at a stand still it sacrifices
[2778.56 - 2785.88] its life for you it gets overloaded your
[2783.04 - 2788.12] white blood cells the Warriors got their
[2785.88 - 2790.84] swords out they're swinging their swords
[2788.12 - 2793.24] they're slaying dragons for you they're
[2790.84 - 2796.04] engulfing multiple toxins and even
[2793.24 - 2797.64] pathogens at any given moment when a
[2796.04 - 2800.88] white blood cell is overwhelmed and
[2797.64 - 2804.56] losing a battle two or three others come
[2800.88 - 2806.92] to its rescue they got its back there's
[2804.56 - 2810.08] communication between white blood cells
[2806.92 - 2811.80] just like dolphins in the ocean which is
[2810.08 - 2814.80] not even partly understood by research
[2811.80 - 2818.24] and science but just like a boat can
[2814.80 - 2821.52] instantly wipe out about half a dozen
[2818.24 - 2824.12] dolphins swimming in the water a school
[2821.52 - 2827.08] of white blood cells can get trashed and
[2824.12 - 2830.20] thrashed hit hard injured and weakened
[2827.08 - 2832.20] in A Storm of toxins and pathogens or a
[2830.20 - 2834.16] larger School white blood cells can
[2832.20 - 2837.24] disappear within minutes as you're
[2834.16 - 2840.40] getting your blood drawn immune cells
[2837.24 - 2843.04] are soldiers they're not indestructible
[2840.40 - 2845.16] they can burn out we already have to
[2843.04 - 2847.40] deal with that but the health system
[2845.16 - 2850.36] trains us to think our blood is
[2847.40 - 2854.68] disposable not really important seven
[2850.36 - 2857.44] vials 10 mlit hey 70 ml here out the
[2854.68 - 2859.92] door no problem 3 months later another
[2857.44 - 2862.52] seven vials again out the door 3 months
[2859.92 - 2865.80] later another seven vials again out the
[2862.52 - 2869.04] door disposable in 6 months 140 MERS or
[2865.80 - 2873.20] more disposable and I'm not even talking
[2869.04 - 2876.28] about a 14 vile blood draw 24 vile blood
[2873.20 - 2879.24] draw 30 vile blood draw
[2876.28 - 2882.12] even more than that 48 times a year when
[2879.24 - 2884.88] you're sick or more out the door how
[2882.12 - 2887.52] many schools of immune cells clusters of
[2884.88 - 2889.12] immune cells have been removed that's
[2887.52 - 2892.20] like schools of
[2889.12 - 2894.84] dolphins swimming in the Bermuda
[2892.20 - 2897.84] Triangle and just
[2894.84 - 2899.88] disappear thrown away without the
[2897.84 - 2903.00] understanding of what it takes for your
[2899.88 - 2904.84] body to reproduce them or what it takes
[2903.00 - 2907.52] for your body to keep everything in
[2904.84 - 2910.04] check that we just talked about and what
[2907.52 - 2912.76] about when you get your blood drawn
[2910.04 - 2915.36] who's keeping track of what's happening
[2912.76 - 2917.96] in your life at the time you're getting
[2915.36 - 2920.96] your blood drawn did the doctor's office
[2917.96 - 2923.24] ask if you're under any stress where you
[2920.96 - 2926.52] might need your immune system really
[2923.24 - 2928.40] strong is a doctor's office asking you
[2926.52 - 2931.60] if you got enough sleep the night before
[2928.40 - 2934.04] your blood was drawn are they asking you
[2931.60 - 2936.48] how much caffeine you consume coffee
[2934.04 - 2939.16] matcha tea green tea tea black tea
[2936.48 - 2941.64] energy drinks caffeine pills including
[2939.16 - 2943.56] caffeine Pharmaceuticals how much
[2941.64 - 2946.60] chocolate you do because chocolate
[2943.56 - 2948.48] contains caffeine too because caffeine
[2946.60 - 2951.36] breaks down the immune system every day
[2948.48 - 2953.96] weakens it because it's defending itself
[2951.36 - 2955.48] against your adrenal and highs and lows
[2953.96 - 2958.08] like when you down your caffeine and
[2955.48 - 2960.80] chocolate and it ignites your adrenals
[2958.08 - 2963.24] to the overload point and your heart
[2960.80 - 2966.84] rate increases as adrenaline floods your
[2963.24 - 2969.16] system adrenaline is so toxic it wears
[2966.84 - 2972.80] down your immune system white blood
[2969.16 - 2974.52] cells can get torched by epinephrine
[2972.80 - 2977.52] which means they can have a short
[2974.52 - 2980.08] lifespan or shorter lifespan which means
[2977.52 - 2983.36] your bones have to produce more immune
[2980.08 - 2986.12] cells which means your doctor should be
[2983.36 - 2988.48] drawing less blood from you during your
[2986.12 - 2990.52] blood test to account for the stress
[2988.48 - 2994.28] your immune system is under from the
[2990.52 - 2996.56] caffeine alone are you a woman about to
[2994.28 - 2998.76] go into your menstrual cycle or
[2996.56 - 3000.52] ovulation where your immune system is
[2998.76 - 3002.88] about to reduce dramatically in your
[3000.52 - 3004.48] bloodstream and at the same time you're
[3002.88 - 3006.96] eating half a bar of chocolate and three
[3004.48 - 3009.96] cups of coffee a day and in this case
[3006.96 - 3012.36] the doctor's office should want to know
[3009.96 - 3015.16] to account for the amount of VI they're
[3012.36 - 3017.40] about to draw but they don't they're not
[3015.16 - 3021.48] asking about anything are you going
[3017.40 - 3023.48] through a divorce a breakup a tough time
[3021.48 - 3026.48] that can have an effect on your immune
[3023.48 - 3031.12] system which leads me to another area
[3026.48 - 3033.08] that's important pregnancy when 50% of
[3031.12 - 3036.24] the woman's immune system is protecting
[3033.08 - 3038.92] and monitoring the baby leaving her with
[3036.24 - 3041.12] only half of her immune system for the
[3038.92 - 3044.64] rest of her body so when a pregnant
[3041.12 - 3047.68] woman gets a blood draw she's losing
[3044.64 - 3050.28] another percentage of her white count
[3047.68 - 3052.80] her immune cells which could be a big
[3050.28 - 3054.92] trigger into postpartum illness of any
[3052.80 - 3057.56] kind and even health issues while
[3054.92 - 3060.56] pregnant and most importantly that blood
[3057.56 - 3062.40] draw could compromise the baby instead
[3060.56 - 3064.64] you'll hear pregnant women have more
[3062.40 - 3066.76] blood and they should come in regularly
[3064.64 - 3068.28] for routine blood tests while pregnant
[3066.76 - 3070.84] doesn't matter how much blood we take
[3068.28 - 3072.92] from them they'll throw away almost all
[3070.84 - 3075.24] the blood with the mommy's immune system
[3072.92 - 3078.28] in it which is needed to protect the
[3075.24 - 3081.04] baby with no consideration of how her
[3078.28 - 3083.92] immune system is juggling this depletion
[3081.04 - 3086.28] at some point the body has to rob Peter
[3083.92 - 3088.96] to pay Paul especially when it comes
[3086.28 - 3090.36] down to protecting the baby and then
[3088.96 - 3093.60] there's something else very important to
[3090.36 - 3096.40] consider new relationships sharing
[3093.60 - 3099.76] microorganisms and pathogens from people
[3096.40 - 3101.72] we're living with newer old friendships
[3099.76 - 3104.24] finding new partners in our life to
[3101.72 - 3107.16] share a life with we all have our own
[3104.24 - 3110.00] Petri dishes built inside of us and our
[3107.16 - 3112.88] immune system has to adjust to normal
[3110.00 - 3115.16] circumstances in life with us spending
[3112.88 - 3117.52] time or being around others you may need
[3115.16 - 3120.36] your immune system at its best and
[3117.52 - 3122.80] strongest when you're falling in love or
[3120.36 - 3125.52] moving in with someone to share the rent
[3122.80 - 3128.00] and sharing bathrooms and kitchens or
[3125.52 - 3131.32] immune systems adjust to these new
[3128.00 - 3133.84] interactions with others as bacteria and
[3131.32 - 3137.32] viruses and fungi cross-contaminate from
[3133.84 - 3140.96] person to person it's normal but blood
[3137.32 - 3143.96] drawn at the wrong time can happen and
[3140.96 - 3146.80] the doctors they're not inquiring to
[3143.96 - 3149.40] determine how many is safest in that
[3146.80 - 3151.36] moment in your life to draw weakening
[3149.40 - 3153.44] the immune system when the immune system
[3151.36 - 3156.56] is already being weakened by protecting
[3153.44 - 3160.56] you and keeping you balanced from new
[3156.56 - 3162.92] exposures but details don't matter to
[3160.56 - 3166.28] the alternative and conventional system
[3162.92 - 3168.88] when it comes to drawing blood they
[3166.28 - 3172.24] don't get to know the people good enough
[3168.88 - 3174.96] before they Vamp them Vamp them steal
[3172.24 - 3178.08] their blood throw almost all of it away
[3174.96 - 3179.40] or sell it on the black market to
[3178.08 - 3182.60] experimental
[3179.40 - 3184.64] Labs we act like getting our blood drawn
[3182.60 - 3187.36] is another errand during the day it's
[3184.64 - 3190.84] just another errand let's see um I got
[3187.36 - 3193.36] to go to the store I got to get a facial
[3190.84 - 3196.24] afterwards um I got to pick up the kids
[3193.36 - 3197.60] from school I got to stop and get 14
[3196.24 - 3200.36] vials of blood
[3197.60 - 3204.20] drawn um I got to get some takeout for
[3200.36 - 3207.08] dinner it's just another errand for many
[3204.20 - 3211.12] let's talk about donating blood they
[3207.08 - 3216.08] take way too much blood in one donation
[3211.12 - 3218.20] 471 to 473 milliters one pint I'm not
[3216.08 - 3221.60] against donating blood we are always in
[3218.20 - 3224.52] need of it it's a lifesaving tool a
[3221.60 - 3227.64] resource for the people who need blood
[3224.52 - 3231.08] transfusions life-saving surgeries from
[3227.64 - 3234.80] accidents with that said it's still a
[3231.08 - 3237.28] bloody mess no matter who you are when
[3234.80 - 3240.56] you don't donate that much blood you go
[3237.28 - 3242.84] into Uncharted Territory there should be
[3240.56 - 3245.80] parameters and critical guidelines when
[3242.84 - 3248.48] donating blood to protect the person
[3245.80 - 3251.32] giving the blood and figuring out how
[3248.48 - 3253.44] much blood is safe for them to give any
[3251.32 - 3256.00] amount of blood is going to compromise
[3253.44 - 3259.12] them but the goal should be about
[3256.00 - 3262.36] compromising the least possible over a
[3259.12 - 3265.40] dozen variables should be set in place
[3262.36 - 3268.28] are you under stress are you sleeping
[3265.40 - 3271.36] are you male or female what's your
[3268.28 - 3273.76] height what's your weight do you plan on
[3271.36 - 3276.96] getting pregnant in the next 3 to six
[3273.76 - 3279.88] months are you in a new relationship or
[3276.96 - 3283.68] did you move in with someone new do you
[3279.88 - 3285.76] use or been exposed to colog perfumes
[3283.68 - 3288.56] sended candles air fresheners hair
[3285.76 - 3291.64] products sended lotions aftershave
[3288.56 - 3295.56] chemical cleaning supplies have you been
[3291.64 - 3298.80] to the dentist recently a female are you
[3295.56 - 3301.52] in ovulation or close to menstration do
[3298.80 - 3304.80] you have any symptoms did you have
[3301.52 - 3309.08] symptoms ever in your life do people
[3304.80 - 3311.36] rely on you do loved ones rely on you
[3309.08 - 3314.16] are you driving the next couple of days
[3311.36 - 3317.16] are you hydrated are you jacked up on
[3314.16 - 3320.48] caffeine or chocolate what's your diet
[3317.16 - 3323.24] like why are you donating blood this is
[3320.48 - 3326.04] not even exhausted list in order to
[3323.24 - 3329.48] donate blood they should not make a
[3326.04 - 3332.36] standard a pint they should take a half
[3329.48 - 3335.60] pint at a time for a male who's healthy
[3332.36 - 3337.72] and strong and less than a half pint for
[3335.60 - 3339.52] a woman depending on many variables
[3337.72 - 3342.56] height weight and everything we
[3339.52 - 3345.88] discussed so far because Women's Health
[3342.56 - 3348.88] and Men's Health is not the same far
[3345.88 - 3350.84] from it care should be taken to protect
[3348.88 - 3354.36] yourself from exposures after a blood
[3350.84 - 3357.64] donation or a blood draw and important
[3354.36 - 3359.96] steps should be taken before and after
[3357.64 - 3363.68] to build the blood and Quicken immune
[3359.96 - 3366.44] cell production without robbing Peter to
[3363.68 - 3368.44] pay Paul you're still going to have to
[3366.44 - 3371.28] take from Peter and you're still going
[3368.44 - 3373.52] to have to pay Paul but the goal is to
[3371.28 - 3376.64] not leave Peter homeless and you still
[3373.52 - 3379.68] want Paul to get enough look we need
[3376.64 - 3382.36] blood donations but we also have to look
[3379.68 - 3384.64] out for the people who are donating if
[3382.36 - 3386.92] we're giving them a pint of blood let's
[3384.64 - 3389.52] make sure we're strong and healthy and
[3386.92 - 3393.08] we take care of ourselves before and
[3389.52 - 3395.88] after donating more on that later let's
[3393.08 - 3399.00] talk about blood draws now if you're a
[3395.88 - 3403.84] woman who's healthy no symptoms and
[3399.00 - 3406.52] strong and above 150 lbs the maximum
[3403.84 - 3409.44] amount of vials they should recommend
[3406.52 - 3413.64] should be four whole vials no bigger
[3409.44 - 3417.32] than 10 mlit each try to ask for half
[3413.64 - 3420.84] vials and smaller tubes if possible
[3417.32 - 3423.16] which becomes two whole vials if you're
[3420.84 - 3428.00] healthy and strong under the weight of
[3423.16 - 3431.80] 150 lbs it should be three whole vials
[3428.00 - 3434.80] try to ask for half vials not whole
[3431.80 - 3438.08] vials if you are compromised in any way
[3434.80 - 3440.84] with symptoms or condition also
[3438.08 - 3446.16] considering the concerns I talked about
[3440.84 - 3449.32] earlier maximum ask for two full vials
[3446.16 - 3452.40] best if you do half vials with those two
[3449.32 - 3456.00] full vials make sure it's half vials for
[3452.40 - 3458.36] those two which will equal one full vial
[3456.00 - 3462.04] if your health is really compromised and
[3458.36 - 3465.84] you're under 100 lb maximum one full
[3462.04 - 3468.44] vial and try to ask for a half vial keep
[3465.84 - 3471.32] in mind they throw almost all of your
[3468.44 - 3473.32] blood away very little is needed
[3471.32 - 3476.12] regardless of what they tell you they
[3473.32 - 3478.56] need ask your doctor doctor if it's okay
[3476.12 - 3480.00] if they can take half FS so in the worst
[3478.56 - 3482.00] case scenario you're worried about
[3480.00 - 3484.64] speaking up or they convince you they
[3482.00 - 3487.48] need the amount of vials they need and
[3484.64 - 3492.00] they're about to draw five or more vials
[3487.48 - 3494.40] ask for half vials the labs will take it
[3492.00 - 3498.52] regardless of what the doctor says or
[3494.40 - 3501.92] the labs say or the FLOTUS says this way
[3498.52 - 3503.92] if you're pressured into 14 vials like
[3501.92 - 3506.72] so many are pressured into by
[3503.92 - 3509.72] specialists it would only equal seven
[3506.72 - 3511.56] vials when they are half filled this is
[3509.72 - 3513.52] still too much blood drawn especially
[3511.56 - 3516.00] for someone who's sick with symptoms or
[3513.52 - 3519.04] a chronic illness but it can help
[3516.00 - 3521.68] protect the person avoiding large blood
[3519.04 - 3523.96] draws is the best thing to do if the
[3521.68 - 3527.12] doctor allows for half files to be
[3523.96 - 3529.92] filled and sends them to the blood lab
[3527.12 - 3532.40] the blood lab will receive them and
[3529.92 - 3534.84] follow through with the testing the
[3532.40 - 3537.68] blood lab may say to the doctors's
[3534.84 - 3541.68] office we want full vials so we can do
[3537.68 - 3543.76] additional tests later on not true once
[3541.68 - 3545.92] they run those tests they don't go back
[3543.76 - 3548.00] to that blood you have to get another
[3545.92 - 3551.24] blood test if something went wrong at
[3548.00 - 3553.72] the blood lab this happens all the time
[3551.24 - 3557.40] you get a call from the doctor's office
[3553.72 - 3560.20] hello what I need to come back in again
[3557.40 - 3564.88] for another blood test uh something
[3560.20 - 3567.60] happened at the lab um oh okay and you
[3564.88 - 3570.64] have to come in for a few more vials if
[3567.60 - 3572.96] you do have to go back in ask for half
[3570.64 - 3576.56] vials and give yourself a little time
[3572.96 - 3579.68] between to recoup doctors tend to try to
[3576.56 - 3583.04] get as many tests done in one blood draw
[3579.68 - 3586.00] as possible if this requires more than
[3583.04 - 3589.12] four full vials of blood for a healthy
[3586.00 - 3590.76] person and more than 1 to three full
[3589.12 - 3593.08] vials of blood for a person who's
[3590.76 - 3594.92] struggling with a health condition then
[3593.08 - 3598.44] you have the option of asking to to
[3594.92 - 3600.48] separate or divide the tests and to come
[3598.44 - 3603.48] back another day for additional blood
[3600.48 - 3606.12] draws for additional tests breaking them
[3603.48 - 3609.68] up so it's not a shock on your immune
[3606.12 - 3612.84] system taking at least 5 days between
[3609.68 - 3616.00] blood draws is best unless it's more
[3612.84 - 3618.60] urgent then sooner is an option there's
[3616.00 - 3622.52] a lot of wastage and mistakes made at
[3618.60 - 3625.52] the blood Labs they're blood hungry it's
[3622.52 - 3628.56] a machine they're like wolves a
[3625.52 - 3630.28] bloodthirsty machine it's not the people
[3628.56 - 3632.56] working there at the blood Labs that are
[3630.28 - 3634.56] the problem they're great they're mostly
[3632.56 - 3637.72] good people doing critical life-saving
[3634.56 - 3640.92] work it's not the doctor's fault they're
[3637.72 - 3644.36] not the problem it's the system that
[3640.92 - 3648.40] shrouds them it's broken it hasn't been
[3644.36 - 3652.40] upgraded adjusted checked in over 80
[3648.40 - 3655.08] years it's Antiquated even if the tests
[3652.40 - 3658.16] become more advanced as medic medicine
[3655.08 - 3660.76] advances it's like that decked out car
[3658.16 - 3664.12] that's got Wi-Fi it still has rubber
[3660.76 - 3666.28] tires gets a flat in the end because he
[3664.12 - 3669.36] just got a rubber tire with air in it
[3666.28 - 3671.88] there's parts of it that are Antiquated
[3669.36 - 3675.08] blood draw for blood tests and donation
[3671.88 - 3677.08] practices need to upgrade they need to
[3675.08 - 3679.32] change for the sake of the People's
[3677.08 - 3682.56] Health and the level of stress on
[3679.32 - 3685.92] doctors watching patients get sicker and
[3682.56 - 3688.12] deteriorate without realizing in it that
[3685.92 - 3690.20] because of the blood draws it's one of
[3688.12 - 3692.96] the biggest triggers to prolonging
[3690.20 - 3695.56] chronic illness let's talk about other
[3692.96 - 3697.56] forms of support if you're someone who
[3695.56 - 3700.64] knows your blood draws scheduled you
[3697.56 - 3703.40] know it's coming you're dreading it you
[3700.64 - 3705.20] know hey I got to get blood and it's not
[3703.40 - 3706.96] a surprise at the doctor's office that
[3705.20 - 3708.60] you're unaware of that day like you
[3706.96 - 3709.76] visit the doctor you're sitting there
[3708.60 - 3712.68] and they're like hey let's take some
[3709.76 - 3716.28] blood then there's a lot of great things
[3712.68 - 3718.76] you can do to prep one week Advance is
[3716.28 - 3722.40] an ideal place to start if you're a
[3718.76 - 3725.60] woman try to time your blood draw before
[3722.40 - 3728.20] you enter menstration ideally a week
[3725.60 - 3731.00] after your cycle even a week before your
[3728.20 - 3733.84] cycle because at these times your immune
[3731.00 - 3736.84] system is strongest in your whole body
[3733.84 - 3739.24] hydration is an ideal way of helping
[3736.84 - 3741.68] your immune system stay strong before
[3739.24 - 3743.76] you get the blood draw so starting a
[3741.68 - 3746.88] week before you get your blood test
[3743.76 - 3749.08] reduce or eliminate your caffeine intake
[3746.88 - 3752.40] if you regularly participate in it
[3749.08 - 3754.28] caffeine is extremely dehydrating no
[3752.40 - 3757.68] matter how much water and juices you're
[3754.28 - 3760.92] consuming it dehydrates the cells your
[3757.68 - 3764.04] hydration never gets to a maximum level
[3760.92 - 3766.12] because caffeine sucks a person dry
[3764.04 - 3770.00] during this week incorporate celery
[3766.12 - 3772.40] juice 16 to 32 ounces every morning do
[3770.00 - 3776.16] not add anything to that celery juice no
[3772.40 - 3779.04] lemon no water no ice no other fruit
[3776.16 - 3782.96] vegetable when you drink water always
[3779.04 - 3785.32] add a little lemon or lime to the water
[3782.96 - 3787.52] this brings in calcium vitamin C and
[3785.32 - 3791.84] other critical trace minerals glucose
[3787.52 - 3796.48] too and nutrients also replenishing your
[3791.84 - 3799.48] cells melons watermelons cantaloupe
[3796.48 - 3802.16] honeydew try to stock up on melons you
[3799.48 - 3803.60] can get a canary melon you can get khaw
[3802.16 - 3807.16] there's other melons out there you can
[3803.60 - 3809.96] find try to eat the melon Blended don't
[3807.16 - 3814.80] add water don't eat the skin of the
[3809.96 - 3817.08] melon 16 o to 32 o of Blended melon
[3814.80 - 3820.52] daily best to do in the morning after
[3817.08 - 3823.28] celery juice the melon helps build up
[3820.52 - 3826.96] electrolytes and glucose reserves in the
[3823.28 - 3830.20] brain tissue melon helps to hydrate bone
[3826.96 - 3832.64] marrow during the day or dinner try to
[3830.20 - 3836.88] bring in some steamed potatoes or sweet
[3832.64 - 3840.16] potatoes keeping them oil oil free and
[3836.88 - 3842.56] free of butter too sour cream cheese or
[3840.16 - 3846.08] any other fat whether your animal
[3842.56 - 3850.00] protein eater or vegan or plant-based
[3846.08 - 3852.48] try to keep your fats lower be cautious
[3850.00 - 3855.88] on how many radical fats you consume in
[3852.48 - 3858.24] a week before your blood test radical
[3855.88 - 3861.20] fats are foods that have a large
[3858.24 - 3865.08] percentage of fat residing in it like
[3861.20 - 3869.76] milk cheese butter oil
[3865.08 - 3874.48] eggs meat chicken turkey fish lamb nuts
[3869.76 - 3876.88] seeds nut Butters avocados soy too nut
[3874.48 - 3879.92] milks almond milk even oat milk it's
[3876.88 - 3883.56] high in fat try to keep any of these
[3879.92 - 3885.88] options to once a day ideally for dinner
[3883.56 - 3888.80] for example having your fish with your
[3885.88 - 3890.80] dinner that's it snack on some fruit
[3888.80 - 3892.28] throughout the day like apples and
[3890.80 - 3894.52] strawberries and
[3892.28 - 3898.72] blueberries wild blueberries would be
[3894.52 - 3902.92] best bananas papaya mango and bring in
[3898.72 - 3905.24] lots of leafy greens spinach preferably
[3902.92 - 3907.04] for all the mineral salts they're
[3905.24 - 3909.44] critical for building your blood and
[3907.04 - 3913.24] strengthening your immune system medical
[3909.44 - 3914.96] medium spinage soup is ideal daily if
[3913.24 - 3917.84] you can't plan a week ahead of your
[3914.96 - 3922.52] blood test then try to apply this days
[3917.84 - 3926.36] before even if it's just one day before
[3922.52 - 3929.60] carry these practices 3 to 7 days after
[3926.36 - 3933.52] your blood test with the addition of 16
[3929.60 - 3936.52] to 32 o of pure straight cucumber juice
[3933.52 - 3939.28] in the afternoon or evening cucumber
[3936.52 - 3943.12] juice helps to improve red blood cells
[3939.28 - 3945.40] after a blood draw two apples a day
[3943.12 - 3948.24] extra papaya and bananas where you can
[3945.40 - 3951.52] for extra potassium and glucose any of
[3948.24 - 3954.28] these food tips applied before and after
[3951.52 - 3957.40] a blood draw will be helpful do do the
[3954.28 - 3960.76] best you can even if it's just getting
[3957.40 - 3963.36] your celery juice in Daily so the sodium
[3960.76 - 3965.36] cluster salts can really charge up those
[3963.36 - 3968.16] electrolytes in those neurotransmitters
[3965.36 - 3972.00] as needed now let's talk about some
[3968.16 - 3973.52] helpful supplements before and after hey
[3972.00 - 3976.12] you can check with your doctor see if
[3973.52 - 3978.12] it's right for you the supplements I
[3976.12 - 3980.60] recommend are the ones that I use for
[3978.12 - 3982.68] myself they don't have any alcohol no
[3980.60 - 3984.56] natural flavors no preservatives the
[3982.68 - 3986.40] cleanest and the best quality it's the
[3984.56 - 3989.60] vimergy company they have something
[3986.40 - 3991.92] called micro it's a form of vitamin C
[3989.60 - 3994.12] for your immune system support vitamin C
[3991.92 - 3997.20] is critical because your immune system
[3994.12 - 3999.00] needs it more than ever because a part
[3997.20 - 4001.92] of your immune system was drawn out of
[3999.00 - 4004.88] your body with the blood draw another
[4001.92 - 4008.56] supplement liquid zinc sulfate from
[4004.88 - 4011.44] vimer G2 zinc is to support the immune
[4008.56 - 4013.28] system that's going to be left over so
[4011.44 - 4016.16] as part of your immune system is lifted
[4013.28 - 4018.52] out of your body removed and thrown away
[4016.16 - 4022.40] the part that's left needs the zinc more
[4018.52 - 4024.68] than ever zinc also keeps viruses doile
[4022.40 - 4027.40] so they don't proliferate so
[4024.68 - 4030.60] easily there's also liquid
[4027.40 - 4032.76] B12 form of adinos silk bamin and
[4030.60 - 4036.20] methylcobalamin that's something I take
[4032.76 - 4038.16] and Trust greatly the right B12 supports
[4036.20 - 4040.48] all bodily functions especially the
[4038.16 - 4042.96] brain function the reason why I like the
[4040.48 - 4045.24] vimer gb12 It doesn't have the
[4042.96 - 4047.28] preservatives in it the citric acid the
[4045.24 - 4049.92] alcohol the natural flavors and other
[4047.28 - 4052.80] stuff they throw in all the other junky
[4049.92 - 4055.92] companies when a tree is ready to be
[4052.80 - 4059.40] planted and taken out of its container
[4055.92 - 4062.52] or root ball it goes into shock as you
[4059.40 - 4065.52] place that tree into the Earth to plant
[4062.52 - 4068.36] you want to slow its shock down you must
[4065.52 - 4071.16] give it a feeding a range of nutrients
[4068.36 - 4075.96] that includes even B vitamins for faster
[4071.16 - 4078.96] recovery B12 is that shock Buster for us
[4075.96 - 4081.00] it feeds us so when we're uprooted like
[4078.96 - 4083.24] when we're getting the blood draw our
[4081.00 - 4086.28] body gets the shock and we need to take
[4083.24 - 4090.08] care of our body so the shock is eased
[4086.28 - 4093.80] so it's less of a shock also magnesium
[4090.08 - 4096.08] glycinate helps to ease any nerve spasms
[4093.80 - 4098.60] that are affected from the missing
[4096.08 - 4101.68] magnesium that disappears when we get
[4098.60 - 4104.76] the blood draw after blood draws muscles
[4101.68 - 4107.04] tend to tighten spasm and
[4104.76 - 4109.92] twitch if you have other supplement
[4107.04 - 4111.52] questions check out medical medium.com I
[4109.92 - 4113.84] have a directory so you can look at the

[4126.04 - 4132.52] expanded New Edition
[4128.96 - 4136.00] version our blood is ancient thousands
[4132.52 - 4139.04] of years old millions of years old it
[4136.00 - 4142.40] gets passed on from generation to
[4139.04 - 4146.64] generation our blood has the history of
[4142.40 - 4149.76] lineage it's a sacred precious resource
[4146.64 - 4153.04] we can't live without it we can't create
[4149.76 - 4157.16] new life without it there's a hidden
[4153.04 - 4160.16] code and messaging in our blood that
[4157.16 - 4164.28] hidden code in messaging is bigger than
[4160.16 - 4166.76] genetics or genes itself uncovered Ing
[4164.28 - 4170.00] and learning the mystery of what sits
[4166.76 - 4171.96] inside our blood is far away from what
[4170.00 - 4176.36] they believe is in our
[4171.96 - 4178.84] DNA the evildoers on the planet know
[4176.36 - 4181.60] there is information inside our blood
[4178.84 - 4184.32] they just haven't cracked it they've
[4181.60 - 4187.28] been experimenting with our blood since
[4184.32 - 4190.64] World War I trying to make sense out of
[4187.28 - 4194.36] it and at the same time pretending it's
[4190.64 - 4197.56] all for us and our health and well-being
[4194.36 - 4201.68] if they had access to the secrets inside
[4197.56 - 4205.20] of us they would gain more control over
[4201.68 - 4208.44] the human race they would clone humans
[4205.20 - 4212.36] at a rate that would surpass all
[4208.44 - 4215.36] imagination where does all our blood go
[4212.36 - 4218.80] it's not used in the blood tests some
[4215.36 - 4221.56] believe it goes down the drain there's a
[4218.80 - 4224.52] great possibility it goes straight to
[4221.56 - 4227.48] medical testing for reasons that are
[4224.52 - 4227.48] totally
[4237.92 - 4240.92] insane
