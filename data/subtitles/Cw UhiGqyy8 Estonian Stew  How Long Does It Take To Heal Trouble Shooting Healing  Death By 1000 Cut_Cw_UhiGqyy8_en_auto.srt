219
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,520

day

301
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:24,959
okay it it wakes up my mind

302
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:26,640
and that's kind of scary because my

303
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,680

304
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,560
already away

305
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:32,480

306
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,720
going going going going and

307
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,160
you know like all day and i don't stop

308
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,240
and i'm on the phone and everything

309
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,560
and that's without celery force but i

310
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:43,839
take celery force myself personally

311
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:46,320
when i get three hours of sleep at night

312
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,360
not because i can't sleep but because i

313
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,399
push myself

314
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:52,160
to the limit to a dangerous limit

315
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,519
and with all the information i got to

316
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,959
put out with the books i'm trying to

317
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:58,160
write everything right

318
00:11:54,959 --> 00:12:00,320
and so what i'll do is i'll like uh

319
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,920
spirit is it is it okay is it okay if i

320
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,160
take some celery force right now

321
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,839
it's rid of compassion soc is like go

322
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,360
ahead take it i know you're only on

323
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,760
three hours two and a half hours of

324
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,200
sleep

325
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,480
but take it you can push yourself a

326
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,320
little harder if that's what you want to

327
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,920
do but take the celery force

328
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,920
next thing you know two and a half hours

329
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,440
of sleep in me and i'm actually going

330
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,680
like as if i didn't even feel like the

331
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,480
sleep even hit me and that's how i use

332
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,240
it i don't know

333
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,720
a lot of people use it because it gives

334
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:28,000
them this focus and concentration

335
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,680
and it clears their mind and

336
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,200

00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,320
those are the ones

375
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:46,000
that end up on things that died right

376
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,440
because because a fermented vegetable

377
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,320
means it died

378
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,440
right it's not like you picked parsley

379
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,360

00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:28,480
elevated biotics

398
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,160
they end up on the parsley it's like a

399
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,680
miracle they appear

everybody's chasing fermented foods

406

after the death the death

407
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:50,000
micro microorganisms they appear on

408
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,120
things that

409
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:57,040
die when something dies right

410
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:58,399
when a body dies all that stuff starts

411
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:01,920
happening when an

412
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:04,880
animal dies all this stuff starts

413
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,199
happening it's all microorganisms that

414
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,000
we

415
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:09,040
that don't do anything for us except for

416
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,880
devour

417
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,399
things that have died and that's the

418
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,120
mess up with fermented foods and i talk

419
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:15,680
about

420
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,440
why people do why fermented foods is so

421
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,560
old in culture right

422
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,959
it's ancient it was to survive crops so

423
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,880
because

424
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:24,079
at the end of the year you died if you

425
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,959
didn't have any food throughout the

426
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,800
winter

427
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:28,320
so you had to throw everything you had

428
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:31,680
in the garden in a giant

429
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:34,160
vat in hopes to god that it preserves

430
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:36,399
through a process of the micro

431
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,519
microorganisms just eating away at it

432
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,320
right just keeping that

433
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:42,240
slop that stinky slop alive that

434
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,360
fermented slop alive right

435
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,040
and then you think the the

436
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,639
microorganisms are giving you all this

437
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,759
stuff but that's not how it works

438
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:52,639
it's just a preserved technique for for

439
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:54,320
villages 2 000 years ago that knew there

440
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,639
would be no food for the winter i took

441
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:59,920
all about it in here

442
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:02,079
suzanna asked for a half file of blood

443
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,920
being drawn tech asked if i was

444

449
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,399

thank you i love you for it alexandra

460
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,440
why would someone without a thyroid have

461
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:46,959
hashimoto's antibodies

462
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:48,880
exactly why would they

463
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:51,120
the reason why they would is because

464
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:53,519
hashimoto's thyroiditis is nothing like

465
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,600
anybody knows

466
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,600
hashimoto's thyroiditis is a mystery to

467
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,800
medical research and science

468
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:03,440
they don't know what it is okay but

469
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,959
it's epstein-barr virus thyroid or no

470
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,559
thyroid you're still going to have the

471
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,559
epstein-barr virus

472
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,679
see the epstein-barr virus caused the

473
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:11,520
thyroid to begin with

474
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:13,120
we end up having your thyroids removed

475
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,679
because of epstein-barr

476
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:17,679
that's how how it works epstein-barr

477
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:19,280
gets into the thyroid causes thyroid

478
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,199
problems thyroid diseases thyroid

479
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,799
conditions we end up losing thyroids

480
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:25,360
many times we don't have a thyroid

481
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:27,520
anymore afterwards and then

482
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,799
we end up still keeping the epstein bar

483
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,520
it's in her system and that's why it's

484
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:31,440
critical

485
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,880
to work on healing it take this to your

486
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,960

500
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,799
raw reiki i tried celery juice years ago

501
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:10,880
but it gave me

502
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:13,600
all my bad food intolerance symptoms huh

503
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,080
i tried celery juice years ago but it

504
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,840
gave me

505
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:20,080
all my bad food intolerance symptoms

506
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:24,160

508
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:33,200
hello yeah

509
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,679

my celery juice

511
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:42,400
yeah i thought it'd be a great idea

512
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:44,000
even though what even though aw in his

513
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,000
book says just don't mix it with

514
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,120
anything

515
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:52,320
but it might help it's gonna make the

516
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:54,840
celery juice not work really so the

517
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:58,080

right

528
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:25,120

and who said it was giving you

533
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:35,520
intolerances

534
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:38,720

535
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:40,559
interesting all in its own okay like

536
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,720
who said it was giving anybody

537
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:45,280
intolerances in general right

538
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,559
when it's amazing the all cat all the

539
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:49,120
food intolerance um

540
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:51,360
all the food intolerant tolerance tests

541
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:54,000
all the food sensitivity tests

542
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,600
all of that are never accurate they've

543
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,120
never been accurate

544
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,520

751
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,840
somebody might be working in a gas

752
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,440

753
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:36,640
it on their hands every day

754
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:38,559

755
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,399
right someone might be eating lots of

756
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:41,600

841
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,640

976
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:49,040
that's the stew right here estonians do

977
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,640
it's really hearty

978
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,079
really good now here's here's what i

979
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,960
recommend if you're an animal protein

980
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:54,079
person

981
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,520
you don't even need to have animal

982
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:56,240
protein that night this thing's gonna

983
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:59,280
hold you

984
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:01,040
over and then some you know

985
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,320
even more than animal protein really if

986
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,599
you're a plant-based

987
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,760
person you don't have to put a whole

988
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:09,200
bunch of fat in this this is fat-free

989
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:10,480
now if um

990
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,640

991
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:14,960

00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:49,280
just the the really most solid

1009
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:50,640
solid based information you could ever

1010
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,240
find on the play

1011
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,920
the amount of crap i've heard out there

1012
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:55,440
since it started has been just utterly

1013
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:57,760
ridiculous

1014
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,960
so this is really this is really a spot

1015
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,800
where you can you can

1016
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:02,320
hear about this and this is about

1017
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,160
healing after the plague

1018
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,599

1019
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,760
the plague or you you

1020
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:09,839
know somebody that had it or you know

1021
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:11,760
and you're beaten down from it and then

1022
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:13,359
you get the reactivated epstein-barr

1023
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,960
and that's that information comes

1024
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:19,839
originally from medical medium so you'll
