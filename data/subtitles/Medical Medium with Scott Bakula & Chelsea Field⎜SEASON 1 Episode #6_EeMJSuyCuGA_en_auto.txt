[98.01 - 102.24] issues and the complications and the
[100.14 - 104.13] doctor visits all the time and you're
[102.24 - 106.32] doing all that and you know it takes
[104.13 - 107.91] them it really takes the toll on people
[106.32 - 109.80] when you're running around in your whole
[107.91 - 111.78] life is about visiting doctors or
[109.80 - 113.58] visiting nutritionists doctors
[111.78 - 114.84] dieticians and then you think this and
[113.58 - 117.12] this and then you're on the internet and
[114.84 - 118.65] you're looking for something else and so
[117.12 - 120.66] you guys are here because hey we're
[118.65 - 123.03] trying to make sure you have the answers
[120.66 - 124.50] that you know that this is powerful
[123.03 - 126.24] information that works and that's what
[124.50 - 127.65] it's about I mean it's about the mission
[126.24 - 129.27] of getting medical medium information
[127.65 - 132.39] out there and I can't believe I got you
[129.27 - 133.19] here again yeah you know there is
[132.39 - 135.29] something that
[133.19 - 137.87] that we were talking about before which
[135.29 - 140.09] is if I'm not mentioning something if
[137.87 - 143.00] I'm not talking about a product like
[140.09 - 146.36] Moringa powder collagen or something
[143.00 - 149.24] else if I'm not behind something I'm not
[146.36 - 153.50] behind beets you know what I mean don't
[149.24 - 154.94] you louder exactly if I'm not behind
[153.50 - 157.10] something like that meringue that's not
[154.94 - 159.80] go G berries if I'm not behind something
[157.10 - 162.29] that means you don't need to have it in
[159.80 - 164.69] your regimen because it's not gonna make
[162.29 - 166.76] or break your movement forward with like
[164.69 - 169.07] a real problem with like real sickness
[166.76 - 170.12] real health issues the whole bit I mean
[169.07 - 172.01] you hear about it all the time right
[170.12 - 174.56] people always like what about this right
[172.01 - 176.72] absolutely so let's let's take beets for
[174.56 - 178.67] example yeah so a lot of people ask me
[176.72 - 180.35] about beets and I had just on my own
[178.67 - 182.03] notice through all of the books that
[180.35 - 183.68] that I had read in the healing foods
[182.03 - 186.11] book he never says anything about bees
[183.68 - 188.18] and one time I it might have been on
[186.11 - 190.49] your podcast or an Instagram live or
[188.18 - 192.74] something one time I heard him say beets
[190.49 - 194.06] and you don't need to you know use beets
[192.74 - 195.95] you don't need to like go out of your
[194.06 - 197.84] way to have some beets and I remember
[195.95 - 199.85] that lodging in my brain I'm thinking
[197.84 - 201.74] okay well I don't know why but I'm just
[199.85 - 203.48] not going to bother and I like beets but
[201.74 - 205.67] there are so many other foods to be
[203.48 - 207.62] eating that are healing foods that are
[205.67 - 209.57] gonna help you process or pull out your
[207.62 - 212.24] heavy-metal detox you know all your
[209.57 - 214.07] heavy metals and so why not focus on
[212.24 - 215.78] those so what is it with beets what's
[214.07 - 218.18] your count of the beets man well beets
[215.78 - 219.98] is like God what about their growing you
[218.18 - 221.57] know what's your problem I know I know
[219.98 - 223.04] you can eat them you could totally them
[221.57 - 224.96] to find I mean you can do that they're
[223.04 - 226.25] fine they're not gonna hurt you you know
[224.96 - 227.93] there's no okay beets out there
[226.25 - 229.61] obviously there's heirloom beets out
[227.93 - 232.82] there but one of the things is that the
[229.61 - 234.80] GMO beets have really cross pollinated
[232.82 - 237.17] okay so like people were worried about
[234.80 - 240.29] GMO well you get these crops were there
[237.17 - 242.90] GMO beets now justice fields and fields
[240.29 - 246.26] and fields of GMO B and so what happens
[242.90 - 248.15] is pollination time boom cross pollinate
[246.26 - 250.49] then the other beets and other fields
[248.15 - 253.19] get affected so beets essentially are
[250.49 - 255.77] not really GMO free it's but it's
[253.19 - 257.03] impossible got to have a GMO for it it's
[255.77 - 259.61] just impossible that's number one number
[257.03 - 261.74] two is it's a filler it's a great way to
[259.61 - 264.02] make money in supplement world for years
[261.74 - 264.83] the whole beet thing mm-hmm it's a great
[264.02 - 266.60] way to make money
[264.83 - 268.43] it's a great way to be like yeah this is
[266.60 - 269.93] gonna be good free than you put it in
[268.43 - 271.88] supplements you'll see it in all these
[269.93 - 274.01] different supplement blends where it's
[271.88 - 275.30] like you know you got this in here this
[274.01 - 276.80] in here this here you got a little bit
[275.30 - 278.96] of this this this this like 50
[276.80 - 280.22] ingredients and one of those powders you
[278.96 - 282.29] know you got the powders and you'll see
[280.22 - 283.85] beet powder in their spinach powder this
[282.29 - 286.25] powder carrot powder and it goes all the
[283.85 - 288.41] way down which really is just a little
[286.25 - 289.94] speck of this in a speck of that and it
[288.41 - 291.86] just rips people off and then you pay
[289.94 - 293.48] like 100 bucks for a big protein powder
[291.86 - 296.27] thing or fifty bucks for a protein
[293.48 - 298.34] powder thing or whatever a juice powder
[296.27 - 300.02] or whatever that might be and so beet
[298.34 - 301.52] greens would be the same thing because
[300.02 - 304.01] it's all the whole thing is GMO without
[301.52 - 306.53] corn it's the same thing the beet green
[304.01 - 308.90] is actually healthier for you okay then
[306.53 - 310.76] the beet but it still got the GMO
[308.90 - 312.05] tendency your possibility that's why I
[310.76 - 314.06] always tell people you know you don't
[312.05 - 315.74] really have to have beets and it was a
[314.06 - 318.05] filler in the juice world back in the
[315.74 - 319.73] old days you juice you juice your carrot
[318.05 - 322.25] to juice your beets you make it nice and
[319.73 - 324.68] sweet you put a little spinach in there
[322.25 - 326.87] was always a filler it was always look
[324.68 - 329.96] does it have healing benefits sure it's
[326.87 - 332.21] a healthy root vegetable it is a healthy
[329.96 - 334.55] root vegetable it's true what is it is
[332.21 - 336.89] it a game-changer no does it clean the
[334.55 - 339.20] liver like wild blueberries no that's
[336.89 - 341.27] the whole point how do you get better if
[339.20 - 342.89] you're getting information everywhere
[341.27 - 344.54] else so then all of a sudden someone's
[342.89 - 346.40] not doing their frozen wild blueberries
[344.54 - 348.44] anymore and now the brain worried about
[346.40 - 350.42] beets and beet powder and beat this and
[348.44 - 351.89] eat that it's always a confusion now
[350.42 - 354.02] they're bringing in their collagen now
[351.89 - 355.64] they what about the Moringa powder doing
[354.02 - 357.20] they're doing all the stuff and then
[355.64 - 358.76] they lose track and then they get
[357.20 - 360.44] another doctor telling them oh you got
[358.76 - 362.30] your microbiome off another doctor
[360.44 - 364.40] telling oh you've got Candida oh you got
[362.30 - 366.80] this you got that and then what happens
[364.40 - 368.18] is you're lost and five years go by and
[366.80 - 370.13] then you still got your Hashimoto's
[368.18 - 371.81] coming on and nobody realizes that you
[370.13 - 373.37] still got your autoimmune diagnosis
[371.81 - 374.78] coming you still got all these other
[373.37 - 376.43] things because the Medical mean
[374.78 - 378.35] information is about the truth about
[376.43 - 380.24] what you really need and you have to
[378.35 - 381.68] adhere to it and you have to keep to it
[380.24 - 383.33] so you can really stay on track
[381.68 - 385.31] absolutely and you find that people end
[383.33 - 387.41] up saying what the the medical medium
[385.31 - 389.27] stuff didn't work for me but if you're
[387.41 - 391.61] combining it with five other people's
[389.27 - 393.74] ideas or philosophies yeah that's not
[391.61 - 394.78] fair really to any of the philosophies
[393.74 - 396.97] you have to
[394.78 - 399.07] you have to jump in well normally that
[396.97 - 400.99] mixing yeah they're always mixing right
[399.07 - 403.03] and that's a human nature because you
[400.99 - 405.07] know a and P if people are in trouble
[403.03 - 406.81] and they're sick they want yes they want
[405.07 - 408.40] to get well right away and it's hard to
[406.81 - 409.93] be patient and I understand people's
[408.40 - 412.51] frustration if it's their skin or
[409.93 - 414.52] whatever's going on and they want may
[412.51 - 416.02] want results but that's where you have
[414.52 - 417.64] to trust you have to look at some of the
[416.02 - 419.56] posts on your Instagram and stuff of
[417.64 - 421.96] people the changes and listen to their
[419.56 - 423.82] stories and understand that there's
[421.96 - 425.92] nobody writing that I did this in a day
[423.82 - 428.23] later I was cured they commit to
[425.92 - 429.76] something it takes time and patience and
[428.23 - 431.47] you have to be have to be kind to
[429.76 - 433.63] yourself and your process because it
[431.47 - 435.37] just it's not like taking you know
[433.63 - 437.08] medication it doesn't change overnight
[435.37 - 439.69] it takes time and everybody's different
[437.08 - 441.49] I see a lot of comments I looked at the
[439.69 - 443.23] comments from our last live and also
[441.49 - 445.48] whenever I'm watching Instagram or the
[443.23 - 447.49] Facebook stuff and there's a lot of
[445.48 - 448.81] comments in the community and that's one
[447.49 - 451.57] of the things that I wanted to say was
[448.81 - 454.09] there's so much information in a the
[451.57 - 456.76] books be the podcasts to see the
[454.09 - 458.83] Instagram live posts all everything at
[456.76 - 460.78] all of the medical medium information
[458.83 - 462.97] that is gettable there's so much
[460.78 - 464.56] information there and in the community
[462.97 - 465.94] because the qalaat of the community has
[464.56 - 468.28] been through a lot and they know and
[465.94 - 470.50] they'll put things on comments and
[468.28 - 472.72] answer questions so that keep keep aware
[470.50 - 475.30] of that and keep watching that but also
[472.72 - 478.39] all of the all of the questions that I
[475.30 - 480.25] saw from last time and in all of the
[478.39 - 482.26] years I've been you know following what
[480.25 - 486.04] Anthony and medical medium says they're
[482.26 - 487.99] all in the books they truly are so I get
[486.04 - 489.64] it some people aren't readers I would
[487.99 - 490.99] suggest maybe getting the audiobook
[489.64 - 493.00] because they aren't their audience so
[490.99 - 494.83] you could get them on audio and listen
[493.00 - 497.35] in the car if you're driving or you know
[494.83 - 499.03] on the subway or whatever cuz really the
[497.35 - 501.31] answers are in the book it's not as
[499.03 - 503.11] direct as like Anthony what's the answer
[501.31 - 504.70] to this like getting the opportunity to
[503.11 - 506.17] speak to him directly but I didn't even
[504.70 - 507.85] do that I'm his friend and I don't call
[506.17 - 509.74] him with all the questions that I have
[507.85 - 511.81] or one of my friends had it it's tough
[509.74 - 513.34] cause yeah I don't want to bother him I
[511.81 - 515.20] respect and honor his well you guys
[513.34 - 516.49] stopped calling yeah you guys stopped
[515.20 - 518.77] calling you're like let's leave him
[516.49 - 520.51] alone he's no he's got too much going on
[518.77 - 523.69] he's got he's got so much going on but
[520.51 - 524.74] seriously the answers are all in the in
[523.69 - 526.75] front of all the medical medium
[524.74 - 528.22] information it is there you you have to
[526.75 - 530.23] read and you have to listen and you have
[528.22 - 532.96] to go through it and you have to put it
[530.23 - 535.09] all together and it you'll find your
[532.96 - 536.83] answers there's a lot of sand traps out
[535.09 - 538.51] there set for the people there's a lot
[536.83 - 540.91] of potholes there's a lot of sand traps
[538.51 - 542.65] and they're set purposely they want to
[540.91 - 544.63] keep your brain washed about protein
[542.65 - 546.76] whether you're vegan or your or your
[544.63 - 548.56] animal protein diet or keto diet
[546.76 - 551.05] high-fat diet they want to keep you all
[548.56 - 553.15] we still set on protein being law
[551.05 - 555.01] somewhere in one of your diets it
[553.15 - 557.08] doesn't matter because meanwhile
[555.01 - 559.21] everybody has enough protein has been
[557.08 - 560.74] getting enough protein has always got
[559.21 - 563.26] enough protein but it doesn't stop
[560.74 - 564.88] chronic illness and the keto diet I know
[563.26 - 566.86] they talk about how it's just a high fat
[564.88 - 568.21] diet high fat diet but anybody I've
[566.86 - 569.44] talked to doing the keto diet they're
[568.21 - 571.09] still worried about how much protein
[569.44 - 571.90] they're eating they're still worried
[571.09 - 573.55] about where they're getting their
[571.90 - 575.11] protein because no matter what it's
[573.55 - 576.64] always about protein so you got
[575.11 - 578.32] everything you know protein warning
[576.64 - 580.69] shakes protein this protein not what
[578.32 - 582.40] happens is that's a sand trap setting
[580.69 - 584.50] the stage so you never have answers to
[582.40 - 585.82] what causes chronic illness and so say
[584.50 - 587.29] you're in good you say you're in good
[585.82 - 588.73] health right now and you're just focused
[587.29 - 590.86] on protein sure but when you start
[588.73 - 592.12] getting sick later then then you're
[590.86 - 593.41] third you're still going to be focused
[592.12 - 595.48] on protein meanwhile you've been getting
[593.41 - 598.12] enough protein everybody yeah you can't
[595.48 - 600.70] not get enough protein no matter what at
[598.12 - 602.59] all times it's not it's not you know
[600.70 - 604.09] it's always been like that and I'm going
[602.59 - 606.34] to talk about fats a little bit too
[604.09 - 608.11] because when you're doing high fats
[606.34 - 610.27] where that gets you in trouble so here
[608.11 - 612.73] there's so many traps you got the high
[610.27 - 614.65] fat trap that just bogs down your liver
[612.73 - 616.87] and pancreas sex your sets the stage for
[614.65 - 618.85] sickness later on - even if it's healthy
[616.87 - 620.62] high fat diets then you get the pie
[618.85 - 622.57] protein where it's all about protein no
[620.62 - 624.94] matter what you see so these traps
[622.57 - 626.50] receptors yeah and the hydrating I mean
[624.94 - 628.12] the animal protein has so much fat in it
[626.50 - 630.28] now the problem with these include
[628.12 - 631.84] exactly I mean it's fine if you I guess
[630.28 - 633.97] we want to have animal protein but
[631.84 - 635.83] you're automatically having fat when you
[633.97 - 636.94] have the animal for exactly and if you
[635.83 - 638.20] want to go claim pee so you guys are
[636.94 - 640.63] plant-based but you don't innovate
[638.20 - 642.16] yourselves with fats 24/7 and that's
[640.63 - 643.48] what they're doing so you got two
[642.16 - 645.10] plant-based people so many of you guys
[643.48 - 647.74] are and you're bringing in the facts all
[645.10 - 650.20] the time and so it's all about always
[647.74 - 651.12] setting potholes there's reasons for
[650.20 - 652.65] this that you don't
[651.12 - 655.20] so you don't move forward there's a
[652.65 - 657.24] reason for why that's happening the
[655.20 - 659.19] industry's all of them including the
[657.24 - 662.07] other alternative industries are set up
[659.19 - 664.08] so you fail somewhere down the line one
[662.07 - 665.91] way or another and that's the difference
[664.08 - 667.44] between the macro medium information and
[665.91 - 668.73] making sure people have a chance because
[667.44 - 670.65] I want people to have a fighting chance
[668.73 - 672.00] because sure when you don't have much
[670.65 - 673.89] going on and you have a little bit of
[672.00 - 676.29] acne and you got a few symptoms and your
[673.89 - 677.94] digestive tracts a little off and you're
[676.29 - 679.50] yelling you're young it's just who cares
[677.94 - 681.27] right you just try this you're doing
[679.50 - 683.04] this you're trying to do this but man
[681.27 - 684.81] when you start it you're now in your 30s
[683.04 - 686.55] now in your 40s you get diagnosed with
[684.81 - 688.65] autoimmune or something else and then
[686.55 - 691.20] you'll feel fine just sinking ship fast
[688.65 - 693.99] between the high protein or the high fat
[691.20 - 696.24] or the collagen you'll find that that
[693.99 - 698.82] ship sinks it starts to sink and people
[696.24 - 701.34] start learning whoa until they know what
[698.82 - 703.74] it's like to go on the path of doctor to
[701.34 - 706.32] doctor to doctor looking for answers
[703.74 - 708.12] trying to find you all of it is when you
[706.32 - 709.62] know it breaks my heart it breaks my
[708.12 - 711.27] heart I've been watching this for so
[709.62 - 713.04] long I have a specific question about
[711.27 - 715.08] this so one of the questions was
[713.04 - 716.88] heavy-metal detox smoothie which we do
[715.08 - 719.67] every day or I do the liver rescue
[716.88 - 721.71] smoothie and I have generally I always
[719.67 - 723.60] do water but a lot of times I'll do cook
[721.71 - 725.85] will do coconut water in the heavy metal
[723.60 - 728.97] toxicity is that okay because I know
[725.85 - 731.04] you're late I know coconut meat has fat
[728.97 - 735.84] yeah but I keep googling coconut fresh
[731.04 - 738.03] coconut coconut water coconut water is
[735.84 - 739.83] is the sugar I mean that's the glucose
[738.03 - 742.11] that's the yeah that's the you know the
[739.83 - 743.91] minerals with the glucose coconut orders
[742.11 - 746.58] and it's an amazing electrolyte there's
[743.91 - 748.89] not but is it good but it's great you
[746.58 - 750.60] can even find a trace of fat no there
[748.89 - 752.28] would be a trace of back okay that's
[750.60 - 754.11] that's nothing it's like it's like but
[752.28 - 756.66] what people are doing you got to have
[754.11 - 758.25] your two avocados you got to have your
[756.66 - 760.32] nut butters you have to have your peanut
[758.25 - 762.36] butter smoothie Bowl in the morning you
[760.32 - 765.09] have to it's nothing but lots of fat yes
[762.36 - 766.47] movement now and you know what it's
[765.09 - 768.15] great when you're working out in a gym
[766.47 - 770.19] for two hours a day it's great when
[768.15 - 772.98] you're 24 years old but you take someone
[770.19 - 774.96] who's 35 and they're not in the gym you
[772.98 - 777.45] know two hours a day and they're you're
[774.96 - 779.31] locking on to the high fat movement
[777.45 - 780.51] whatever it is and they're but they're
[779.31 - 781.98] getting sicker and they've got the
[780.51 - 782.92] thyroid problems and they're too getting
[781.98 - 784.36] diagnosed with
[782.92 - 786.10] this and getting the eczema and
[784.36 - 788.68] psoriasis are getting the rashes
[786.10 - 791.53] everywhere and in all of a sudden it's a
[788.68 - 792.91] sand trap right it's like constantly
[791.53 - 794.47] there right so no matter what
[792.91 - 796.63] alternative medicine you think it's
[794.47 - 798.13] advanced it's actually not advanced
[796.63 - 803.11] they're teaching people to do green
[798.13 - 805.03] juices they're teaching people to do why
[803.11 - 807.49] would you place the amazing taste of an
[805.03 - 809.86] avocado in a smoothie I mean like save
[807.49 - 813.70] that avocado like to put on your salad
[809.86 - 815.74] or or you know in your baked potato you
[813.70 - 817.45] know if you want to do that but don't
[815.74 - 819.28] stick it in a smoothie especially I mean
[817.45 - 821.11] if you're doing a heavy metal and it
[819.28 - 823.15] look here's the thing you know you guys
[821.11 - 825.13] like it it's okay to have a little bit
[823.15 - 826.63] of fats whether you're animal protein
[825.13 - 828.49] whether you're not whether you're vegan
[826.63 - 830.11] plant-based it's okay to have a little
[828.49 - 832.45] bit in there but right now we're being
[830.11 - 834.07] taught by complete mistakes just like
[832.45 - 835.99] we're always making guessing games and
[834.07 - 838.69] mistakes all the time we're being taught
[835.99 - 841.15] high fat high fat high fat you know it's
[838.69 - 842.77] taking advantage ration and guess what
[841.15 - 844.98] it just means heart palpitations it
[842.77 - 847.99] means hot flashes later on it means
[844.98 - 850.12] sluggish stagnant liver it needs all
[847.99 - 852.40] these things and it means eczema eczema
[850.12 - 854.32] can't go away on the high fat diet you
[852.40 - 856.45] might improve it once you've gone off of
[854.32 - 858.70] processed foods high fat so here you are
[856.45 - 860.23] processed foods high fat you got to
[858.70 - 862.03] winter of donuts cakes cookies whatever
[860.23 - 864.25] I'm doing right and you move on to the
[862.03 - 866.23] you move on to the better diet where
[864.25 - 868.42] you're now you know at the clean keto or
[866.23 - 870.28] a clean high-fat diet right yes you're
[868.42 - 871.63] gonna get some improvements your skin
[870.28 - 873.97] might show some improvements in the more
[871.63 - 875.92] in the moment all of that but sure later
[873.97 - 877.48] you're destined it's just getting here
[875.92 - 879.91] it's just the whole point yeah the
[877.48 - 881.95] system is set up no matter what because
[879.91 - 883.18] by mistakes just total mistakes there's
[881.95 - 884.89] reasons for that I mean there's a whole
[883.18 - 886.33] bunch because then you get the art you
[884.89 - 889.45] get the articles backing up those
[886.33 - 891.16] mistakes you get the propaganda you get
[889.45 - 893.26] the studies that are really not even
[891.16 - 894.79] real and you get all of that and then
[893.26 - 896.41] everybody hops on the internet they're
[894.79 - 898.57] like oh this article here this study
[896.41 - 900.79] here on this person said this and then
[898.57 - 902.95] they try to validate what they want to
[900.79 - 904.87] do and they're still doing it all wrong
[902.95 - 906.55] right and look I'm only saying this
[904.87 - 908.26] that's not like I'm it's not like I'm
[906.55 - 910.06] sitting here selling something now I'm
[908.26 - 912.82] gonna do an infomercial on hey so buying
[910.06 - 914.23] this product right no no I'm not so

[936.01 - 938.65] long you been doing they're like well
[937.27 - 940.78] I've been doing that for like three
[938.65 - 942.97] months now and I'm like no wonder why
[940.78 - 944.71] and they're like I thought it was your
[942.97 - 946.66] information I'm like why would it be my
[944.71 - 948.46] information so that's what's happened he
[946.66 - 950.32] said there's so many different landmines
[948.46 - 952.06] out there about what to do and I'm not
[950.32 - 953.86] ripping apart the keto diet still better
[952.06 - 956.62] than any standard American diet I'm not
[953.86 - 958.12] ripping apart you know I Pro Paleo diet
[956.62 - 960.64] I'm not ripping apart the best vegan
[958.12 - 962.95] diet I'm not ripping apart that it's
[960.64 - 964.68] just about you guys are spits and pieces
[962.95 - 967.00] miss and that's what you guys see
[964.68 - 969.10] writing this up absolutely I had a
[967.00 - 970.78] family member just last week asked me
[969.10 - 972.04] why is Anthony bah bah bah bah bah I
[970.78 - 973.42] said well where did you get that he goes
[972.04 - 975.37] oh I heard it from some people at the
[973.42 - 977.68] office and I'm thinking okay well hey
[975.37 - 980.14] that's not true and B you have to you
[977.68 - 982.21] have to understand what he's about by
[980.14 - 983.32] what listening to other people no you
[982.21 - 985.09] have to read the book so you have to
[983.32 - 987.01] watch his Instagram you have to you know
[985.09 - 989.29] do the work unfortunately there is some
[987.01 - 991.06] work on your part you know and and you
[989.29 - 993.64] need to take responsibility for your
[991.06 - 995.71] healing in that just talking to people
[993.64 - 998.14] and just listening to what they say is
[995.71 - 999.61] is not good enough read the books the
[998.14 - 1001.23] information there I probably want to
[999.61 - 1003.75] encourage you that if you do that that
[1001.23 - 1006.00] the results are there their results good
[1003.75 - 1008.07] results to be had but and and also at
[1006.00 - 1010.17] the same time saying we recognize it
[1008.07 - 1012.03] it's not easy and you know we've been at
[1010.17 - 1014.46] it you know if even when you start to a
[1012.03 - 1016.32] simple you know achievable it's like the
[1014.46 - 1018.69] pikelet Kloster that's another thing but
[1016.32 - 1021.30] you what what can a three point three
[1018.69 - 1022.86] foot talks yeah what can I do today for
[1021.30 - 1025.76] myself can I get up every day and say
[1022.86 - 1029.13] can I do my 16 ounces of lemon juice
[1025.76 - 1030.93] lemon water yeah with with two lemons in
[1029.13 - 1033.63] it squeezed in it are can I commit to
[1030.93 - 1035.01] making sixteen ounces at least of celery
[1033.63 - 1037.16] juice every day and forget everything
[1035.01 - 1040.16] else and that's all you can do that's
[1037.16 - 1040.16] fantastic
[1042.09 - 1047.67] yes so is it is there a specific amount
[1045.33 - 1050.04] of lemons I mean I used to do two in 16
[1047.67 - 1052.47] ounces now I do one I mean is there a
[1050.04 - 1053.85] specific amount and also when how soon
[1052.47 - 1055.35] should you hydrate when you get up in
[1053.85 - 1057.81] the morning I mean I do it pretty much
[1055.35 - 1059.16] right away yeah is is there because your
[1057.81 - 1060.87] the body needs to hydrate as soon as you
[1059.16 - 1063.11] get up and start cleansing right wait we
[1060.87 - 1065.37] wake up dehydrated yes just we just
[1063.11 - 1066.87] automatically every morning we wake up
[1065.37 - 1069.03] dehydrated if you have anything
[1066.87 - 1071.52] neurological going on it's really a cool
[1069.03 - 1073.11] point right there this is so critical if
[1071.52 - 1075.33] you have aches and pains that are kind
[1073.11 - 1076.77] of unexplainable if you've got tangles
[1075.33 - 1079.11] and numbness ringing in the ears
[1076.77 - 1081.09] dizziness balance issues any vertigo in
[1079.11 - 1083.58] the past if you have focus and
[1081.09 - 1085.59] concentration issues if you have any
[1083.58 - 1087.20] kind of insomnia if you have any kind of
[1085.59 - 1089.85] sleeping issues all of it anything
[1087.20 - 1091.62] neurological migraines headaches all of
[1089.85 - 1093.36] this including things I haven't even
[1091.62 - 1095.10] mentioned that that are neurological
[1093.36 - 1097.05] tics spasms and so forth maybe I did
[1095.10 - 1098.61] mention that but the bottom line is
[1097.05 - 1100.74] anything like that maybe you've been
[1098.61 - 1102.48] diagnosed with neurological Lyme maybe
[1100.74 - 1104.16] you have a diagnosis that involves the
[1102.48 - 1105.99] nervous system and you don't know it and
[1104.16 - 1107.88] it's all based around central nervous so
[1105.99 - 1110.01] the whole point is we wake up in the
[1107.88 - 1113.22] morning dehydrated and our nervous
[1110.01 - 1115.62] system is is desperate for like a lemon
[1113.22 - 1117.63] water desperate for something like that
[1115.62 - 1120.48] lecture lights and everything else and
[1117.63 - 1123.00] it's so important we all night long your
[1120.48 - 1125.55] liver is packing up the garbage is what
[1123.00 - 1128.07] it's doing and if you had a really high
[1125.55 - 1130.53] fat dinner at night then it's really
[1128.07 - 1132.69] packaged working hard it's over labored
[1130.53 - 1134.04] it's trying to cleanse but there's the
[1132.69 - 1135.36] fats are in the bloodstream that's
[1134.04 - 1137.70] really hard for the liver when we have
[1135.36 - 1139.68] really high fat dinners so here we are
[1137.70 - 1141.66] you know the whole high fat movement is
[1139.68 - 1144.51] supposed to be so good for you but man
[1141.66 - 1145.71] when you have a high fat dinner and okay
[1144.51 - 1147.30] maybe someone's like well what does that
[1145.71 - 1148.98] mean how fat dinner you know what I'm
[1147.30 - 1150.72] saying if you're putting oil on
[1148.98 - 1152.49] something and on your dinner if you're
[1150.72 - 1154.68] if you're doing too many nut butters at
[1152.49 - 1156.60] night if you're doing if you're doing
[1154.68 - 1158.58] two avocados at night if you're doing
[1156.60 - 1160.41] you know oil on on your food whether
[1158.58 - 1163.35] it's vegan or some other different meal
[1160.41 - 1165.00] or whatever eat whatever it is and maybe
[1163.35 - 1167.79] you're doing CMM you're doing animal
[1165.00 - 1169.77] proteins at 92 plus oil on your salad
[1167.79 - 1172.33] you're just doing it's just too much fat
[1169.77 - 1174.79] right there your bloodstream but yeah
[1172.33 - 1176.95] but err exactly whatever it could be you
[1174.79 - 1178.87] got and then and then all night long
[1176.95 - 1181.33] your blood fat is really high you have
[1178.87 - 1183.70] less oxygen to your brain less oxygen to
[1181.33 - 1186.07] your organs any kind of illness can
[1183.70 - 1189.19] actually move forward and getting worse
[1186.07 - 1190.66] over time versus getting better because
[1189.19 - 1192.70] the fats are too high it's not like you
[1190.66 - 1194.47] had a half an avocado it's not like you
[1192.70 - 1196.27] had you might have had nut butters that
[1194.47 - 1197.77] day if your plant-based but that should
[1196.27 - 1199.60] be about it if you had nut butters that
[1197.77 - 1202.39] day maybe dinner time shouldn't be so
[1199.60 - 1204.34] high in that and so it's it's in that
[1202.39 - 1206.77] kind of you know on that kind of level
[1204.34 - 1208.69] so all night long your liver struggling
[1206.77 - 1210.99] it's indicated with fat it goes up the
[1208.69 - 1213.85] paddock portal highway into the liver it
[1210.99 - 1215.89] soaks into there so your livers battling
[1213.85 - 1217.36] to take out the garbage to detoxify by
[1215.89 - 1219.79] morning time you're extra hot
[1217.36 - 1222.88] dehydrating because fats the hydrate us
[1219.79 - 1225.04] so we're extra dehydrated and so by
[1222.88 - 1227.59] morning time if you don't get that lemon
[1225.04 - 1230.62] water you know that flush in the morning
[1227.59 - 1232.69] not hydration and flush you can be it
[1230.62 - 1234.76] compiles it then the new livers backed
[1232.69 - 1236.80] up another day another week in your life
[1234.76 - 1238.36] then another month in your life because
[1236.80 - 1241.00] your liver can even though it's still
[1238.36 - 1243.37] working it can back up weeks and weeks
[1241.00 - 1246.01] and in years and then become diseased
[1243.37 - 1249.76] like stagnant sluggish fatty liver
[1246.01 - 1251.44] diabetes type 2 diabetes anything like
[1249.76 - 1253.51] they get the hot flashes you get the
[1251.44 - 1255.52] weight gain and the weight gain comes on
[1253.51 - 1257.68] and all that because your liver is just
[1255.52 - 1259.45] too stagnant and sluggish over time and
[1257.68 - 1264.43] they work we can be dehydrated for
[1259.45 - 1267.52] decades where's my lemon water well and
[1264.43 - 1270.28] I'm sorry Kiwi I remember you saying and
[1267.52 - 1272.02] the dehydration gets us off yeah yeah
[1270.28 - 1273.91] okay so go ahead no I just saw her so
[1272.02 - 1276.25] then the lemon water will take that
[1273.91 - 1277.93] liver and give that liver flushes in our
[1276.25 - 1279.25] yeah it helps it flush in the morning
[1277.93 - 1281.47] that's the thing it flushes out
[1279.25 - 1283.30] delivering nobody knew that nobody knew
[1281.47 - 1285.64] that that's medical medium information I
[1283.30 - 1288.85] mean people put squeezing lemon in water
[1285.64 - 1289.72] for centuries okay centuries that's what
[1288.85 - 1291.19] they've been doing they've been
[1289.72 - 1294.16] squeezing lemon in water that's that's
[1291.19 - 1296.41] been around long before me but as far as
[1294.16 - 1298.06] it's flushing out the liver as far as it
[1296.41 - 1299.95] flushing out toxins out of the body
[1298.06 - 1302.23] that's a medical medium information now
[1299.95 - 1304.36] it's become law out there meaning it's
[1302.23 - 1306.55] out there and after people know
[1304.36 - 1310.57] that information region eights from my
[1306.55 - 1312.37] source that's the whole point and so you
[1310.57 - 1314.92] know look the whole the whole point is
[1312.37 - 1316.66] and I've actually talked about that on
[1314.92 - 1318.49] the years about the lemon water doing
[1316.66 - 1320.89] this through lectures in the past right
[1318.49 - 1322.60] many years ago this isn't just three
[1320.89 - 1324.94] years ago five years ago is doing
[1322.60 - 1327.10] lectures thirty years ago in places I
[1324.94 - 1330.04] mean I was on the bottom of churches I
[1327.10 - 1331.69] was in church basements I doing last
[1330.04 - 1333.58] year's four to three hundred people at a
[1331.69 - 1335.11] clip then going to the next church to
[1333.58 - 1337.00] three hundred people at a clip the next
[1335.11 - 1340.03] church at war health food store or
[1337.00 - 1341.98] whatever back in the old days teaching
[1340.03 - 1344.20] people about these various things about
[1341.98 - 1346.63] all of it including avocados are good
[1344.20 - 1348.10] for you teaching people that avocados
[1346.63 - 1349.66] are good for you yeah okay
[1348.10 - 1351.37] meaning you don't want to over eat them
[1349.66 - 1353.50] but they're good for you yeah that
[1351.37 - 1355.69] people thought avocados were poison back
[1353.50 - 1357.76] thirty years ago doctors wouldn't let
[1355.69 - 1359.59] you eat them people people they know in
[1357.76 - 1362.14] the health movement you can find one in
[1359.59 - 1364.45] the health food store okay and and
[1362.14 - 1367.21] literally I went from state to state
[1364.45 - 1368.89] over the decades teaching people you can
[1367.21 - 1370.78] eat this at Mikado it's actually good
[1368.89 - 1373.00] for you now everybody's over here and so
[1370.78 - 1374.80] now I'm actually doing the opposite slow
[1373.00 - 1376.75] down I mean out of the two hundred and
[1374.80 - 1378.73] fifty thousand individuals I helped out
[1376.75 - 1380.44] in the last thirty five years one on one
[1378.73 - 1383.38] not even the lectures and other things I
[1380.44 - 1385.33] taught them about the lemon water so
[1383.38 - 1387.85] when someone says he didn't delete it
[1385.33 - 1389.74] knows what lemon water he didn't he
[1387.85 - 1391.57] wasn't the guy that's know about
[1389.74 - 1393.34] flushing out the liver flushing out the
[1391.57 - 1395.41] toxins and hydrating you first thing in
[1393.34 - 1397.84] the morning not originated from a mean
[1395.41 - 1399.49] and it does help and it's critical so if
[1397.84 - 1401.68] you're doing that in the morning it
[1399.49 - 1402.10] makes a huge impact on how does it
[1401.68 - 1404.44] matter
[1402.10 - 1405.85] yeah two lemons oh it doesn't matter one
[1404.44 - 1407.95] lemon two lemon there's eight ounces
[1405.85 - 1409.39] sixteen ounces I mean more that's a
[1407.95 - 1410.98] really good point you know some people
[1409.39 - 1412.96] they don't like the lemon it's sharp
[1410.98 - 1415.42] they don't like the hit by and you know
[1412.96 - 1417.70] they feel kind of like it's too intense
[1415.42 - 1420.19] they can do a half a lemon in sixteen
[1417.70 - 1422.11] ounces if they really want that's fine I
[1420.19 - 1424.81] like a whole lemon in sixteen ounces
[1422.11 - 1427.42] what I do yeah in some limits are much
[1424.81 - 1429.34] more juicier yeah so you just got this
[1427.42 - 1431.86] game going on and then you wait how long
[1429.34 - 1434.11] before the celery juice yeah yeah half
[1431.86 - 1436.00] an hour's past 20 minutes you could do
[1434.11 - 1436.72] probably and the question I get all the
[1436.00 - 1440.95] time is why
[1436.72 - 1443.58] sixteen ounces of celery juice in the
[1440.95 - 1448.21] celery book I know it's in the celery
[1443.58 - 1450.73] right now in the book but I just was in
[1448.21 - 1452.95] the book yes but we're not gonna tell ya
[1450.73 - 1454.24] no no yeah we're gonna let him tell ya
[1452.95 - 1457.00] it's people asked all the time yeah I
[1454.24 - 1459.82] want the short cut what yeah yes okay so
[1457.00 - 1461.71] yeah 16 ounces because you need the
[1459.82 - 1465.01] travel time it has so many obstacles
[1461.71 - 1467.23] that celery juice has so many problems
[1465.01 - 1470.01] meaning it's gonna run into because
[1467.23 - 1472.66] everybody's a mess they're a mess inside
[1470.01 - 1474.28] everybody is a disaster inside meaning
[1472.66 - 1475.75] you know and that's what happens so you
[1474.28 - 1476.26] said whatever you know basically what
[1475.75 - 1478.54] that means
[1476.26 - 1480.16] you got you got streptococcus e.coli
[1478.54 - 1482.56] people got all kinds of different levels
[1480.16 - 1484.57] of bacteria they could viruses in their
[1482.56 - 1485.71] system in their livers they got bacteria
[1484.57 - 1487.87] in their intestinal tract lymphatic
[1485.71 - 1489.16] system they have that to begin with you
[1487.87 - 1491.56] know that's just to start with they have
[1489.16 - 1496.15] putrified and you guys everybody has
[1491.56 - 1498.43] this putrified fats that are lined up on
[1496.15 - 1502.39] the intestinal walls just sitting there
[1498.43 - 1504.70] and what's behind it is is bacteria okay
[1502.39 - 1506.74] and that is why this has nothing to do
[1504.70 - 1508.30] with microbiome crap that you hear out
[1506.74 - 1510.10] there like the new like that's just a
[1508.30 - 1512.35] new talk because Candida is dying out
[1510.10 - 1514.75] that whole fad and shrank basically I
[1512.35 - 1516.37] knocked out the Candida trend back yeah
[1514.75 - 1518.80] the first publication of medical media
[1516.37 - 1521.08] but I hurt that trend so bad good
[1518.80 - 1523.39] because because it was completely
[1521.08 - 1525.76] misguided right because Candida without
[1523.39 - 1527.98] Candida we died right so the whole thing
[1525.76 - 1529.84] about Candida being died for you and and
[1527.98 - 1531.58] and how do you have to get rid of all of
[1529.84 - 1533.32] it we stopped that the medical medium
[1531.58 - 1534.67] information so then they had to move
[1533.32 - 1536.74] into something else they had to move
[1534.67 - 1538.54] into the SIBO they had to move into
[1536.74 - 1540.55] their microbiome and now I got to
[1538.54 - 1543.58] actually work on that now where that's
[1540.55 - 1545.98] not it either because what it is is we
[1543.58 - 1547.78] have purified protein and fat lining on
[1545.98 - 1550.30] the intestinal lining is just on the
[1547.78 - 1552.97] walls of the gut right and that's the
[1550.30 - 1556.48] problem with with Lobel reserves in the
[1552.97 - 1558.07] liver weak livers low hydrochloric acid
[1556.48 - 1560.62] in their stomach and that's where the
[1558.07 - 1562.87] real main problem is so then bacteria
[1560.62 - 1565.21] harbors behind this fat lining that's in
[1562.87 - 1567.25] the intestinal in intestinal walls and
[1565.21 - 1569.80] and behind that protein fat that's
[1567.25 - 1571.90] actually been it's rancid and it's cake
[1569.80 - 1573.91] on all the way down which is why when
[1571.90 - 1574.90] people have this this feeling of like
[1573.91 - 1576.40] they have to go to the bathroom right
[1574.90 - 1577.75] away when they and they drink it and a
[1576.40 - 1578.11] lot of people have that I had it for two
[1577.75 - 1579.79] years
[1578.11 - 1581.38] yeah so learn to use I dream my celery
[1579.79 - 1583.24] juicers went to the bathroom and then it
[1581.38 - 1586.09] stopped because that 16 ounces is
[1583.24 - 1588.28] working on dissolving that lining it's
[1586.09 - 1590.14] dissolving the sodium cluster salt said
[1588.28 - 1593.35] science research has no idea about is
[1590.14 - 1595.96] actually dissolving the fats the rancid
[1593.35 - 1597.97] fats and rancid proteins on the walls of
[1595.96 - 1600.07] the intestinal tract and starting to
[1597.97 - 1601.96] break it away and your body wants to rid
[1600.07 - 1603.58] that poison so it's just like yeah I got
[1601.96 - 1605.47] to rid this poison I got rid of it and
[1603.58 - 1607.57] get it out so it's trying to push it out
[1605.47 - 1609.25] fast some people are so toxic you guys
[1607.57 - 1611.35] know you probably know somebody some
[1609.25 - 1613.21] people are so toxic where they haven't
[1611.35 - 1615.04] hit something it's like whoa yeah and
[1613.21 - 1616.93] and so yeah and if you're and if you're
[1615.04 - 1619.21] not you know if you could do more
[1616.93 - 1621.13] sellers you should do more and you if
[1619.21 - 1622.96] you can handle it you do more you do 32
[1621.13 - 1624.70] ounces or whatever but that's how it
[1622.96 - 1626.29] works but just stick with it if that's
[1624.70 - 1627.94] the effect on you and you're like I
[1626.29 - 1629.44] can't do this because I have to run to
[1627.94 - 1631.21] the bathroom right away get up a little
[1629.44 - 1632.74] bit earlier you have your celery juice
[1631.21 - 1634.39] being home so you can run to the
[1632.74 - 1637.03] bathroom when you need to because
[1634.39 - 1639.37] literally I had that for two years and
[1637.03 - 1641.41] after about two years year and a half it
[1639.37 - 1642.79] started changing and now I don't have it
[1641.41 - 1644.80] anymore and all I can assume is that
[1642.79 - 1646.75] most of that sludge that was packed on
[1644.80 - 1648.49] the sides of the intestine have has gone
[1646.75 - 1650.86] away and now everything is normal in
[1648.49 - 1652.48] terms of I get up you know well then
[1650.86 - 1653.83] then the sodium plus the salts of the
[1652.48 - 1655.63] celery juice can kill off the
[1653.83 - 1657.79] streptococcus and people say well I
[1655.63 - 1659.20] don't have strep well did you have strep
[1657.79 - 1661.48] throat when you were a kid because it's
[1659.20 - 1662.98] day menu it's still there yeah and it
[1661.48 - 1666.13] causes acne later
[1662.98 - 1669.73] it causes UTIs bladder infections
[1666.13 - 1672.43] interstitial cystitis right it causes
[1669.73 - 1675.28] you know overactive bladder kidney
[1672.43 - 1676.93] infections it causes yeast infections so
[1675.28 - 1679.18] when people get the yeast infection
[1676.93 - 1680.83] diagnosis that's streptococcus behind
[1679.18 - 1684.10] that interes that's what that is
[1680.83 - 1686.32] so yeah people don't know that there's
[1684.10 - 1689.11] so much work so when you says the celery
[1686.32 - 1691.06] juice has so many obstacles there's you
[1689.11 - 1692.80] need 16 ounces because there's a lot to
[1691.06 - 1694.45] do there's a lot to do right there's a
[1692.80 - 1695.98] lot to break down and each person
[1694.45 - 1697.60] there's a lot of poison to move out of
[1695.98 - 1699.07] the liver there's a lot of poison to
[1697.60 - 1699.74] move out that you test the line you ever
[1699.07 - 1701.39] dissolve that
[1699.74 - 1703.88] that and that old protein that's been
[1701.39 - 1705.71] caked on and then then you got
[1703.88 - 1707.30] everybody's pharmaceuticals inside their
[1705.71 - 1709.10] liver they've got things inside their
[1707.30 - 1711.02] liver then you got to push all that down
[1709.10 - 1713.93] old pharmaceuticals you guys ever taken
[1711.02 - 1715.58] antibiotic well you need 16 ounces or
[1713.93 - 1717.83] more soda juice because you got to flush
[1715.58 - 1720.44] out those old antibiotics and push them
[1717.83 - 1722.87] out yeah you know and so it's got so
[1720.44 - 1724.43] much work to do and then then what if
[1722.87 - 1727.46] somebody had a big dinner the night
[1724.43 - 1729.29] before that's in the way the celery just
[1727.46 - 1730.73] has to find its way into your liver it's
[1729.29 - 1732.65] got to go down your intestinal tract
[1730.73 - 1735.80] it's got to go up the hepatic portal
[1732.65 - 1737.84] veins right up into the liver and then
[1735.80 - 1739.55] it's got to go out of the liver and back
[1737.84 - 1743.09] into the system it's unbelievable what
[1739.55 - 1746.69] it has to do right and it's kind of
[1743.09 - 1749.09] simple it's simple if you just accept
[1746.69 - 1751.10] that and try it yes and then be amazed
[1749.09 - 1753.14] and then you got people that got focused
[1751.10 - 1755.87] concentration issues they got they got
[1753.14 - 1757.07] brain issues and and yeah they got the
[1755.87 - 1758.99] high anxiety they get focus
[1757.07 - 1760.88] concentration they got it different
[1758.99 - 1762.44] brain issues and then the sodium cluster
[1760.88 - 1763.97] salts have the electrolytes have to find
[1762.44 - 1765.71] their way to your brain so you need the
[1763.97 - 1768.32] 16 ounces to go all through that and
[1765.71 - 1770.38] then find the way to the brain so you
[1768.32 - 1772.16] can get sharp so you can get your your
[1770.38 - 1773.57] neurotransmitters back so you can start
[1772.16 - 1774.77] thinking see your electrical impulses
[1773.57 - 1776.66] can do what they need to do so they
[1774.77 - 1779.63] could run down the neurons and actually
[1776.66 - 1781.91] fire so you can be sharp and quick it's
[1779.63 - 1783.62] all of that I have a question so yeah
[1781.91 - 1784.91] we're talking about the internal body
[1783.62 - 1787.79] and there were a couple of questions
[1784.91 - 1789.23] that came up on the last life about one
[1787.79 - 1790.79] person said oh I had back pain but when
[1789.23 - 1792.38] I started doing celery juice it went
[1790.79 - 1793.97] away and another person said that they
[1792.38 - 1796.01] had tennis elbow and when they started
[1793.97 - 1798.08] consistently doing that so talk a little
[1796.01 - 1800.81] bit about like the external physical
[1798.08 - 1804.11] skeletal muscular part of celery juice
[1800.81 - 1806.15] helping that yeah tennis elbow if you
[1804.11 - 1807.95] have an injury it's one thing if you
[1806.15 - 1810.02] have something mysterious happening like
[1807.95 - 1812.84] tennis elbow mm-hmm where it's not
[1810.02 - 1815.15] really an injury it's just not it's just
[1812.84 - 1817.58] inflammation that's there you're dealing
[1815.15 - 1819.02] with low-grade viral activity so when
[1817.58 - 1820.88] you're drinking your celery juice you're
[1819.02 - 1822.35] lowering your viral activity or you're
[1820.88 - 1823.85] knocking down your Epstein Barr virus
[1822.35 - 1826.58] you're knocking down your
[1823.85 - 1829.25] hhv-6 or shingles viruses like the back
[1826.58 - 1829.86] pain yeah back pain Epstein Barr doesn't
[1829.25 - 1831.72] necessarily
[1829.86 - 1833.25] go to the back to off minutes it's
[1831.72 - 1836.28] actually rare that it heads to the back
[1833.25 - 1838.32] too much but shingles always goes to the
[1836.28 - 1839.97] back and you don't need a rash to have
[1838.32 - 1841.89] that right you're drinking your celery
[1839.97 - 1843.33] juice you're knocking down your shingles
[1841.89 - 1845.37] inflammation right because that's what
[1843.33 - 1845.91] happens people get this the sciatic
[1845.37 - 1847.47] nerve
[1845.91 - 1849.00] yeah and they get the static problem
[1847.47 - 1850.56] since that's the whole point and you're
[1849.00 - 1853.32] going every much jingles you should be
[1850.56 - 1855.12] on celery juice mom yeah yeah that's for
[1853.32 - 1857.52] my mom I played tennis my whole life
[1855.12 - 1860.34] very seriously very competitively and
[1857.52 - 1862.61] the amount of tennis elbow that I came
[1860.34 - 1865.08] across in my life that was always
[1862.61 - 1866.64] unexplicable nobody knew really what to
[1865.08 - 1869.49] do they tied a little band around your
[1866.64 - 1871.02] forearm here to somehow relay and some
[1869.49 - 1872.70] people would do it it still didn't work
[1871.02 - 1876.54] and there was no there was it was
[1872.70 - 1878.70] completely undiagnosed and and random
[1876.54 - 1880.41] and I literally played thousands and
[1878.70 - 1882.15] thousands of hours of competitive tennis
[1880.41 - 1883.62] Wow and there was no reason for why one
[1882.15 - 1885.18] person would have everybody's hitting
[1883.62 - 1886.56] the same ball the same way to graça
[1885.18 - 1888.12] there's no reason but one person would
[1886.56 - 1889.68] have it why wouldn't everybody get it
[1888.12 - 1891.27] everybody's playing the same amount of
[1889.68 - 1892.44] tennis and that makes a lot of sense
[1891.27 - 1894.21] when you describe it
[1892.44 - 1896.22] yeah when you're viral what happens is
[1894.21 - 1898.14] that when you use a part of your body
[1896.22 - 1901.32] when you use a part of your body a lot
[1898.14 - 1903.27] and you've got a low-grade virus that's
[1901.32 - 1906.09] in the body it takes advantage of
[1903.27 - 1907.77] anything you're using too much interest
[1906.09 - 1909.96] that's what happens I don't even know if
[1907.77 - 1911.73] I talked about that in a radio sure if I
[1909.96 - 1913.26] talked about this it's probably talked
[1911.73 - 1914.52] about that in the focus I definitely
[1913.26 - 1915.87] know I probably talked about that in the
[1914.52 - 1917.94] books for sure but I haven't talked
[1915.87 - 1919.92] about it only about that too much
[1917.94 - 1921.33] if you're using too much of something
[1919.92 - 1926.97] like you're using your back too much
[1921.33 - 1928.44] you're using your leg to your knee if
[1926.97 - 1929.64] you're using someone like that you got
[1928.44 - 1931.32] the little great viral thing that we
[1929.64 - 1933.03] cleaned up with you yeah that's what
[1931.32 - 1935.67] happens saying the tennis elbow same
[1933.03 - 1938.46] with tendonitis the whole tendinitis
[1935.67 - 1943.29] thing that whole thing that's all
[1938.46 - 1945.18] yeah yeah all of that is low-grade viral
[1943.29 - 1947.31] activity when you're using something too
[1945.18 - 1948.99] much whatever it is then what happens
[1947.31 - 1950.55] there yeah you start taking care of
[1948.99 - 1952.02] yourself you get celery juice in you get
[1950.55 - 1954.15] the right information you're not doing
[1952.02 - 1956.52] all that collagen junk powder which will
[1954.15 - 1958.83] just make you sick I'd be doing yeah
[1956.52 - 1960.60] yeah exactly gotta be careful whatever
[1958.83 - 1961.89] dye you subscribe to does it matter
[1960.60 - 1963.15] you got to be care and then you can
[1961.89 - 1964.38] clean these viruses up
[1963.15 - 1966.15] you know the protocols you learn the
[1964.38 - 1969.11] supplements I get a new book coming out
[1966.15 - 1971.34] that I'm not announcing it's a surprise
[1969.11 - 1973.92] I've been announced a new book for him
[1971.34 - 1975.93] know in the old days this is a
[1973.92 - 1979.35] retraction but it's a live retraction
[1975.93 - 1980.88] right I mistakenly last time we were
[1979.35 - 1983.88] here I said they haven't he was working
[1980.88 - 1986.82] on a brain book and people responded
[1983.88 - 1988.68] very positively about that instantly
[1986.82 - 1991.14] about it it was a complete fabrication
[1988.68 - 1992.91] on my part I misunderstood something
[1991.14 - 1997.23] that I thought I knew I thought I'd
[1992.91 - 1999.51] heard and he is not working on a brain
[1997.23 - 2002.21] book so I I just want to say that
[1999.51 - 2005.60] publicly so pleased I apologize for
[2002.21 - 2007.94] getting people's hopes up there will be
[2005.60 - 2009.80] a great book down down the road he gets
[2007.94 - 2011.63] to say that yeah I don't there will be
[2009.80 - 2016.09] there will be my bad I got a surprise
[2011.63 - 2024.35] daddy myself from YouTube video I just
[2016.09 - 2025.76] rated myself on the island yeah no I got
[2024.35 - 2028.04] a surprise book coming I'm gonna talk
[2025.76 - 2029.75] about the gut involved in there it's
[2028.04 - 2031.58] gonna be like some of me a lot of that
[2029.75 - 2033.35] it's gonna be really it's gonna be
[2031.58 - 2035.57] mind-blowing I think when people get
[2033.35 - 2036.62] this but I also so you want me to let
[2035.57 - 2039.05] you announce that you don't want me to
[2036.62 - 2041.27] announce yeah that's right but I will
[2039.05 - 2044.06] say I'm you know give people a hint know
[2041.27 - 2045.74] I have over 200 different like illnesses
[2044.06 - 2048.14] conditions and symptoms in this book
[2045.74 - 2050.78] also with how to address it with the
[2048.14 - 2053.60] right dosages great of supplementation
[2050.78 - 2055.28] how to really move people forward like
[2053.60 - 2057.47] never before even though all the books
[2055.28 - 2066.71] do that yeah sure this is going to be
[2057.47 - 2069.11] quite a surprise this comes directly
[2066.71 - 2070.19] from me on the questions but again I
[2069.11 - 2072.74] know a lot of people that suffer from
[2070.19 - 2074.45] allergies and people always say oh my
[2072.74 - 2076.28] gosh my allergies are horrible the
[2074.45 - 2078.53] pollens out there I've never had
[2076.28 - 2080.15] allergies and so but I do i do empathize
[2078.53 - 2081.44] because I have friends and family
[2080.15 - 2084.38] members that suffer from it
[2081.44 - 2086.69] so why do we blame nature for allergies
[2084.38 - 2088.13] like isn't it something because I mean
[2086.69 - 2089.87] if we're doing all this shouldn't we
[2088.13 - 2092.21] eventually shouldn't that ologies
[2089.87 - 2093.68] eventually be cleared up why do we do
[2092.21 - 2094.74] when you take care of yourself they do
[2093.68 - 2096.81] it
[2094.74 - 2098.70] one just gets off of gluten their
[2096.81 - 2101.82] allergies start to actually improve
[2098.70 - 2104.04] mm-hmm it's it's incredible because
[2101.82 - 2106.62] gluten and this is medical medium
[2104.04 - 2109.23] information feeds bugs nobody knew it
[2106.62 - 2111.75] fed bugs like they took the whole gluten
[2109.23 - 2113.57] thing the wheat thing being bad all that
[2111.75 - 2116.01] information but not one single
[2113.57 - 2118.41] professional whether they come out with
[2116.01 - 2120.00] books are not new gluten feeds bugs
[2118.41 - 2121.71] until the medical media information came
[2120.00 - 2123.90] to town to teach people that's the
[2121.71 - 2125.73] reason why you get sick when you have
[2123.90 - 2127.74] gluten versus somebody else who doesn't
[2125.73 - 2129.42] get sick when they have gluten he says
[2127.74 - 2132.51] they don't have the bugs feeding off it
[2129.42 - 2134.94] as someone else does so that's how the
[2132.51 - 2136.68] warming okay so if you're if you're if
[2134.94 - 2139.71] you're somebody is high you know prone
[2136.68 - 2142.65] to allergies you have pathogens like
[2139.71 - 2144.39] bacteria and viruses in your liver and
[2142.65 - 2147.21] in your lymphatic system and in your
[2144.39 - 2148.56] sinuses and in places in your body so
[2147.21 - 2150.81] think you're gonna be now sensitive to
[2148.56 - 2152.91] other other things so we're gonna Paul
[2150.81 - 2154.92] and it's going those triggers those
[2152.91 - 2156.33] triggers but it's because you've got
[2154.92 - 2158.04] those things in your the blood in your
[2156.33 - 2160.59] bio Buster because the bugs are already
[2158.04 - 2162.00] producing toxins like Mars has produced
[2160.59 - 2164.04] neurotoxins to actually make you
[2162.00 - 2165.98] chemical sensitive so the epstein-barr
[2164.04 - 2169.08] actually makes people chemical sensitive
[2165.98 - 2171.06] you know and then and then streptococcus
[2169.08 - 2174.39] gives people sensitivities in their
[2171.06 - 2175.01] lungs and in their sinuses and even in
[2174.39 - 2177.51] their bladder
[2175.01 - 2179.70] it gives them sensitivities they'll get
[2177.51 - 2181.47] the status feeling stuff go get the
[2179.70 - 2183.45] bladder irritation still get the sinus
[2181.47 - 2185.40] problems to sinus headaches they'll get
[2183.45 - 2187.56] the lung stuff they'll have you know all
[2185.40 - 2189.75] of that going on because they got this
[2187.56 - 2191.82] long-term chronic streptococcus
[2189.75 - 2193.56] infection and there's over 50 groups of
[2191.82 - 2195.33] streptococcus undiscovered by research
[2193.56 - 2197.64] and science with all with so many
[2195.33 - 2199.29] strains it's not even countable you can
[2197.64 - 2200.67] pick them up in a public bathroom you
[2199.29 - 2202.47] can pick them up in a restaurant doing
[2200.67 - 2204.27] we're eating restaurant food you can
[2202.47 - 2205.92] pick them up for relationships you can
[2204.27 - 2207.66] get a new strap that's highly enigmatic
[2205.92 - 2209.73] resistant from somebody who's got a
[2207.66 - 2210.75] strep you know in a relationship and
[2209.73 - 2212.73] they've actually been you know
[2210.75 - 2214.23] bombarding it for antibiotics for 20
[2212.73 - 2216.09] years then you pick up the strep and now
[2214.23 - 2219.63] you got this strip and then strep is
[2216.09 - 2221.40] just everywhere and so what happens is
[2219.63 - 2223.29] that you become sensitive you sensitive
[2221.40 - 2225.15] allergies pollen you can be sent you can
[2223.29 - 2227.10] be a young child that senses pollen
[2225.15 - 2228.88] because it's trap because children have
[2227.10 - 2231.49] strap they just
[2228.88 - 2233.41] they do they do and so you end up with
[2231.49 - 2235.39] these long-term allergies but when you
[2233.41 - 2237.85] knock down that strap that streptococcus
[2235.39 - 2240.10] bacteria your allergies go away you get
[2237.85 - 2243.22] rid of gluten your allergies can improve
[2240.10 - 2245.14] great you get rid of dairy products your
[2243.22 - 2247.39] allergies actually start to improve you
[2245.14 - 2249.64] get rid of eggs they really start to
[2247.39 - 2250.84] improve and then okay and then you get
[2249.64 - 2252.34] somebody else they don't really have
[2250.84 - 2253.60] much going on inside of them make it eat
[2252.34 - 2254.86] whatever I mean I know people they're
[2253.60 - 2256.66] like nine years old they can eat what
[2254.86 - 2259.09] they want sure I mean but they don't
[2256.66 - 2260.92] have maybe as many bugs so very very
[2259.09 - 2262.69] little and they just they're just some
[2260.92 - 2266.44] of those old dinosaurs out there that
[2262.69 - 2267.82] that that don't exist anymore coming up
[2266.44 - 2269.92] the world has changed
[2267.82 - 2271.81] yes mr. Silva this next question is
[2269.92 - 2274.18] exactly about that there was a question
[2271.81 - 2275.53] that why do we have more pathogens today
[2274.18 - 2278.02] than we did in the yesteryear and there
[2275.53 - 2280.69] was a flight attendant who said she's
[2278.02 - 2283.96] been you know flying for over 20 years
[2280.69 - 2286.15] and she noticed that seems to be so much
[2283.96 - 2287.83] more chronic illness from she was seeing
[2286.15 - 2289.93] customers coming on the plane you know
[2287.83 - 2291.79] every day in her in her career just
[2289.93 - 2293.56] saying so many more chronic illnesses
[2291.79 - 2295.72] now than there was when she started from
[2293.56 - 2298.18] yeah yeah because because what's
[2295.72 - 2300.28] happening well that's why the industry
[2298.18 - 2302.95] wants to blame it on your genes they
[2300.28 - 2305.65] want to say that literally yeah the
[2302.95 - 2307.93] global population our genes went bad in
[2305.65 - 2310.06] the last 30 years that's what they want
[2307.93 - 2312.88] to say yeah they want it they want us to
[2310.06 - 2315.01] believe and they want women to believe
[2312.88 - 2318.94] especially women yeah they want women to
[2315.01 - 2321.10] believe their genes are bad that's what
[2318.94 - 2323.59] they want because it's a way to control
[2321.10 - 2326.20] women it's disempowerment yeah that's
[2323.59 - 2330.70] how the industry's work if women get too
[2326.20 - 2333.07] much power the world gets better that's
[2330.70 - 2334.84] how it works I mean I mean what happens
[2333.07 - 2335.74] so you have the key to land without keep
[2334.84 - 2338.23] them in the dark
[2335.74 - 2341.20] keep them sick teach women that their
[2338.23 - 2343.51] bodies attacking itself which is which
[2341.20 - 2345.91] is evil yeah that's the autoimmune
[2343.51 - 2347.32] theory that your body's attacking itself
[2345.91 - 2349.87] so they want to teach women that your
[2347.32 - 2351.70] body's attacking itself and it's sad
[2349.87 - 2355.15] because they'll use women doctors to do
[2351.70 - 2357.52] it the only thing women doctors they'll
[2355.15 - 2359.41] use women doctors to actually do it to
[2357.52 - 2361.15] carry that on then you know your bodies
[2359.41 - 2362.51] are destroying itself it's actually your
[2361.15 - 2364.13] body's immune system is just
[2362.51 - 2366.11] - thyroid causing Hashimoto's your
[2364.13 - 2368.81] body's immune system is destroying your
[2366.11 - 2371.15] skin causing eczema psoriasis it's a
[2368.81 - 2374.15] technique of the industry to use
[2371.15 - 2377.03] something that has no science behind it
[2374.15 - 2379.12] that's valid whatsoever because they've
[2377.03 - 2382.10] never seen the auto antibody they
[2379.12 - 2385.16] supposedly see they've never seen it
[2382.10 - 2387.35] create an issue in an organ ever it's
[2385.16 - 2389.33] not possible so they have no proof
[2387.35 - 2392.42] whatsoever it was a theory that came out
[2389.33 - 2395.93] in the 1950s no really in the 1950s when
[2392.42 - 2398.39] when technology was what in 1949 and
[2395.93 - 2400.04] 1950 52 think about it so it was a
[2398.39 - 2403.07] theory that your body's attacking itself
[2400.04 - 2405.77] so they want to control women disempower
[2403.07 - 2407.33] them kick them down keep them down by
[2405.77 - 2409.34] keeping everybody sick with chronic
[2407.33 - 2411.44] illness especially women by telling them
[2409.34 - 2413.03] their body's attacking itself or it's
[2411.44 - 2415.67] your genes or bowles
[2413.03 - 2417.23] yeah and so there's a reason for this
[2415.67 - 2418.37] because then you think your genes are
[2417.23 - 2421.67] bad so you better get your breasts
[2418.37 - 2423.41] removed yeah that's how it's done your
[2421.67 - 2423.83] genes are bad so you better something
[2423.41 - 2426.50] else
[2423.83 - 2428.96] Eugene and the reason why they do this
[2426.50 - 2431.33] is because the industry has to protect
[2428.96 - 2434.48] itself because it doesn't have the
[2431.33 - 2436.31] answers right right so it doesn't have
[2434.48 - 2438.11] the answers it just does and one
[2436.31 - 2440.54] examples Lyme disease medical medium
[2438.11 - 2443.60] information has moved to the Lyme
[2440.54 - 2445.37] disease diagnosis the industry changed
[2443.60 - 2448.34] it because of medical media right they
[2445.37 - 2452.23] took it out of bacterial and they put it
[2448.34 - 2454.85] in autoimmune because of the books
[2452.23 - 2457.49] because the books have went around to so
[2454.85 - 2461.81] many doctors so many people around the
[2457.49 - 2463.43] play had to put it into something else
[2461.81 - 2465.20] they had a shifted because the Lyme
[2463.43 - 2467.42] disease is viable right it's not
[2465.20 - 2468.80] bacterial this is a prime example so you
[2467.42 - 2470.96] stuck it in autoimmune now they're
[2468.80 - 2472.22] trying to shift the game they put it not
[2470.96 - 2473.78] on me to mean the meaning they don't
[2472.22 - 2475.19] know what causes Lyme disease now and
[2473.78 - 2476.48] the Lyme labs are hurting because of
[2475.19 - 2478.07] this will leave me there hurt and
[2476.48 - 2480.29] they've note the big industry off of
[2478.07 - 2482.27] that and they're hurting so they moved
[2480.29 - 2484.79] it off often to autoimmune into the
[2482.27 - 2487.70] history it's it's shifting and to miss
[2484.79 - 2489.80] realness but then they can say it's your
[2487.70 - 2492.14] genes that's causing a lot of disease
[2489.80 - 2493.13] now or autoimmune and your body keeps
[2492.14 - 2495.17] swimming down because you're
[2493.13 - 2498.32] disempowered you don't please
[2495.17 - 2501.17] you don't have the answers to really
[2498.32 - 2503.12] help yourself heal yeah and so you think
[2501.17 - 2504.89] your body's the problem isn't that body
[2503.12 - 2507.77] shaming you have been saying this for a
[2504.89 - 2509.84] feel ever it's it this is the new body
[2507.77 - 2512.57] shaming that's happening with the
[2509.84 - 2514.34] industries and no one even sees it they
[2512.57 - 2516.92] just accept it like we're just supposed
[2514.34 - 2518.39] to be brainwashed and accept it and you
[2516.92 - 2520.10] know what ability when said when a
[2518.39 - 2521.90] doctor tells that to you and I had one
[2520.10 - 2524.96] talk how many years ago before I had
[2521.90 - 2526.64] thyroid issues it come I can remember
[2524.96 - 2528.02] the feeling the minute the doctor said
[2526.64 - 2530.57] it to me I remember the feeling it's
[2528.02 - 2532.16] like I can sit remember it to in one
[2530.57 - 2533.45] second I was sitting in a chair he said
[2532.16 - 2536.00] it and there was a feeling that went
[2533.45 - 2538.31] through my entire body that just it felt
[2536.00 - 2539.69] horrible that my body would be attacking
[2538.31 - 2540.89] itself and it's I've never ever
[2539.69 - 2542.54] forgotten it and I was probably about
[2540.89 - 2544.40] thirty years old so that was 32 years
[2542.54 - 2547.79] ago yeah well you know when you're
[2544.40 - 2549.29] telling a 16 year old a daughter when
[2547.79 - 2550.76] they're telling you know 16 year old a
[2549.29 - 2552.47] 15 year old and they're looking online
[2550.76 - 2554.33] and they see they have Hashimoto's and
[2552.47 - 2558.32] then they see that their bodies are
[2554.33 - 2561.05] attacking itself at age 15 this is on
[2558.32 - 2563.90] purpose because they've never ever seen
[2561.05 - 2565.91] in a study or a test that the body is
[2563.90 - 2569.03] attacking itself so why would they do
[2565.91 - 2571.13] that to our kids why would they do that
[2569.03 - 2574.31] when they have no proof there's never
[2571.13 - 2576.29] been a study to prove it yeah how is it
[2574.31 - 2578.27] possible that they're actually putting
[2576.29 - 2581.27] that I'm in right now that information
[2578.27 - 2584.24] out there because they want to yeah
[2581.27 - 2587.72] that's what they want for desperate for
[2584.24 - 2589.84] answers and they they want that you go
[2587.72 - 2591.98] into it we've been trained to go into it
[2589.84 - 2594.62] believing everything their doctor says
[2591.98 - 2597.62] yeah because and instead of my dad have
[2594.62 - 2601.07] a saying said if you don't know say you
[2597.62 - 2602.96] don't know yeah but but no that's if
[2601.07 - 2605.18] that's honest that's yeah we don't know
[2602.96 - 2606.59] so maybe there's some other medical
[2605.18 - 2608.12] people saying what do you mean you don't
[2606.59 - 2609.47] know you're my doctor you if you don't
[2608.12 - 2612.74] know then what's gonna happen to me
[2609.47 - 2614.63] there are doctors who say to me
[2612.74 - 2616.49] the world is changing there there are a
[2614.63 - 2619.46] couple of doctors that have said to me a
[2616.49 - 2621.05] couple of Surgeons actually and another
[2619.46 - 2622.79] doctor that just said we just we don't
[2621.05 - 2624.53] know we don't have the answers and that
[2622.79 - 2626.42] was the most honest thing and I
[2624.53 - 2627.47] respected those doctors because it takes
[2626.42 - 2629.66] a lot of courage to say
[2627.47 - 2631.88] doctors are incredible yes science and
[2629.66 - 2633.77] research that's not coming out and
[2631.88 - 2635.36] saying we don't have the answers right
[2633.77 - 2637.76] because they're protecting its
[2635.36 - 2639.32] protecting its of course and and so it's
[2637.76 - 2640.52] not being honest and saying we don't
[2639.32 - 2642.41] have the answers of why you have
[2640.52 - 2644.06] excellent psoriasis we don't have the
[2642.41 - 2645.05] answers where you have Hashimoto's we
[2644.06 - 2646.67] don't have the answers where you have
[2645.05 - 2649.49] multiple sclerosis we don't have the
[2646.67 - 2652.31] answers with whatever this is and so
[2649.49 - 2654.71] instead they don't care doctors care
[2652.31 - 2657.23] yeah doctors care they care what they
[2654.71 - 2658.91] care they're in it to care yeah but
[2657.23 - 2661.40] science and research doesn't care about
[2658.91 - 2663.23] the doctors doesn't care about the
[2661.40 - 2666.23] doctors that get sick doesn't care about
[2663.23 - 2668.84] anybody because if it did it wouldn't
[2666.23 - 2670.52] torture 15 year old 16 year old 17 year
[2668.84 - 2672.47] olds I know mom's talk to me all the
[2670.52 - 2675.20] time or all through the years that
[2672.47 - 2678.14] literally their child is sitting there
[2675.20 - 2680.51] like thinking this is it it's over yeah
[2678.14 - 2682.40] because they found that wait a minute
[2680.51 - 2686.06] there's this it's autoimmune
[2682.40 - 2689.24] and so that system set up to hurt people
[2686.06 - 2691.07] and you know what and then when you put
[2689.24 - 2693.35] out something to help reverse it all
[2691.07 - 2694.85] help you know get people better they
[2693.35 - 2696.38] attack someone is using say there's no
[2694.85 - 2697.58] science of research behind celery juice
[2696.38 - 2699.50] meanwhile there's no science and
[2697.58 - 2701.63] research about the body attack so that's
[2699.50 - 2703.42] actually valid right but no they'll
[2701.63 - 2705.29] still turn around and say there's no
[2703.42 - 2708.20] soldiers use meanwhile people are
[2705.29 - 2710.36] actually healing that's the good news
[2708.20 - 2712.31] do the celery juice for six months and
[2710.36 - 2714.20] you see how you feel and you look at
[2712.31 - 2715.70] your numbers my girlfriend I just went
[2714.20 - 2717.89] through breast cancer and she reversed
[2715.70 - 2719.75] her 100 180 degree with her diet
[2717.89 - 2721.73] she no celery juice every day and you
[2719.75 - 2724.97] know very very little fat no added salt
[2721.73 - 2727.16] or sugar she's really like amazing and
[2724.97 - 2728.78] all of her numbers have drastically
[2727.16 - 2729.80] changed in less than a year and all of
[2728.78 - 2731.90] her doctors have said how are you doing
[2729.80 - 2734.51] and she's like through diet through all
[2731.90 - 2736.16] of this food and it's been amazing and
[2734.51 - 2737.96] that is science that's her own science
[2736.16 - 2740.03] and research she's done okay I'm gonna
[2737.96 - 2741.77] move on to something light-hearted will
[2740.03 - 2744.44] you tell the story you tell the story I
[2741.77 - 2745.85] think Anthony told the story maybe in
[2744.44 - 2748.55] one of your podcasters oh no you're
[2745.85 - 2750.68] scaring me no no I'm scared it's really
[2748.55 - 2751.57] a great story because I want to try one
[2750.68 - 2754.03] of the things that Ivan
[2751.57 - 2756.40] wanting to do is to try to find somebody
[2754.03 - 2757.78] who can teach like wild food gathering
[2756.40 - 2759.94] and that what does it call like I'm
[2757.78 - 2762.70] foraging I kind of want to do that and
[2759.94 - 2763.39] it reminded me of the story of the
[2762.70 - 2768.16] fiddle firm
[2763.39 - 2770.41] oh yeah the fiddlehead ferns because you
[2768.16 - 2772.72] can eat fiddlehead ferns so it's
[2770.41 - 2774.84] inedible to wild edible plant you know
[2772.72 - 2778.21] I've spent a lot of my early childhood
[2774.84 - 2779.65] like gathering wild food because my
[2778.21 - 2781.84] source tells me what's good what's bad
[2779.65 - 2783.85] whatever and I would eat all kinds of
[2781.84 - 2786.88] weird mushrooms out in the field you
[2783.85 - 2788.68] come across a mushroom and yeah all
[2786.88 - 2790.42] right I'm gonna risk it don't do that
[2788.68 - 2791.71] though don't pick wild mushrooms don't
[2790.42 - 2794.29] play with that don't risk
[2791.71 - 2797.83] don't risk that it's not worth it no I
[2794.29 - 2800.65] mean I have known professionals that
[2797.83 - 2803.32] know their mushrooms huh data burn their
[2800.65 - 2806.26] tongue out of their mouth literally
[2803.32 - 2807.70] because of putting the wrong wild
[2806.26 - 2809.83] mushroom on their tongue why they were
[2807.70 - 2811.99] out in the field you know and I've
[2809.83 - 2814.21] always said just I don't just don't play
[2811.99 - 2816.58] with it yeah yeah don't play with
[2814.21 - 2818.44] mushrooms and you know and I would you
[2816.58 - 2820.90] know but fiddlehead ferns they taste so
[2818.44 - 2823.06] good and you know so I just Saturday
[2820.90 - 2825.46] take I just sat in this little area that
[2823.06 - 2827.92] I found a big crop and I just ate one
[2825.46 - 2829.36] after another until the spirits say
[2827.92 - 2832.06] don't eat too much don't eat too many
[2829.36 - 2835.30] because they're so they're so not only
[2832.06 - 2838.12] medicinal but they have like an alkaloid
[2835.30 - 2839.77] on them that you're just really tough on
[2838.12 - 2842.02] the intestinal tract if you've eaten way
[2839.77 - 2844.24] too many of them there so they have this
[2842.02 - 2846.22] bitter alkaloid that it just could make
[2844.24 - 2848.41] you just feel so sick if you overeat
[2846.22 - 2850.54] these you know maybe four or five of
[2848.41 - 2853.03] them are fine you know and I don't know
[2850.54 - 2857.08] I must have eaten 30 or 40 or 50 of them
[2853.03 - 2860.32] I was just laying in a patch just I was
[2857.08 - 2863.86] in fetal position I was laying in a
[2860.32 - 2865.33] patch I was so sad and then you know
[2863.86 - 2866.92] what after I got over it
[2865.33 - 2869.56] I picked a whole you know I picked a
[2866.92 - 2871.18] whole like bale of a more and just
[2869.56 - 2872.74] brought him back to the house and ate
[2871.18 - 2875.59] him again and then that was it I was
[2872.74 - 2878.01] just it was the stupidest thing it was
[2875.59 - 2884.79] the stupidest thing
[2878.01 - 2886.98] yeah you ain't even tell the story good
[2884.79 - 2888.75] and you know there was - two times it
[2886.98 - 2891.54] happened there is a time work there's a
[2888.75 - 2893.25] store that had into while yeah
[2891.54 - 2895.74] I've been mean and then I bought a
[2893.25 - 2897.93] marinade over ate them because you know
[2895.74 - 2900.93] what it is it's like it's like it's like
[2897.93 - 2903.21] when something tastes so good and it's
[2900.93 - 2906.32] so good for you you just say you know
[2903.21 - 2906.32] what a little bit more why not
[2914.96 - 2918.84] you know I've sat in a while too many
[2918.00 - 2920.97] Oreo
[2918.84 - 2923.49] picking wild blueberries until I
[2920.97 - 2925.41] couldn't eat another like I just like
[2923.49 - 2928.41] just till I just laid in a wild
[2925.41 - 2931.05] blueberry feels like blue from my toe
[2928.41 - 2932.88] and just stuff that wild blueberries
[2931.05 - 2934.80] because it's just that one moment where
[2932.88 - 2946.80] you know you get a chance to do that in
[2934.80 - 2948.57] your life it's a special moment okay so
[2946.80 - 2949.98] some people wanted to know what we ate
[2948.57 - 2951.81] the rest of the day because on the last
[2949.98 - 2954.30] live I guess it sounded like all we ate
[2951.81 - 2959.10] was donors you the celery juice and the
[2954.30 - 2960.69] lemon water and Alan and and and our
[2959.10 - 2963.45] heavy-metal detox smoothie which is not
[2960.69 - 2964.98] all we eat but we obviously we do a lot
[2963.45 - 2967.32] of recipes that are in Anthony's books
[2964.98 - 2969.96] we love the spaghetti bolognaise that's
[2967.32 - 2972.33] amazing and we do that for gas a lot
[2969.96 - 2973.89] that come over we I make the quiche a
[2972.33 - 2976.17] lot probably once every couple of weeks
[2973.89 - 2978.27] and I was going to say if you're able to
[2976.17 - 2981.96] make your own food and do some of the
[2978.27 - 2985.68] recipes do them in bulk because you can
[2981.96 - 2987.69] like I made the the quiche last week and
[2985.68 - 2989.49] Scott was in you know New Orleans and I
[2987.69 - 2991.77] had a girlfriend over and we both had
[2989.49 - 2992.85] and then I had it like for lunch the
[2991.77 - 2994.17] next day and then the next day for
[2992.85 - 2996.12] dinner I just threw it with a bunch of
[2994.17 - 2998.01] greens and a little bit of lemon on the
[2996.12 - 3000.92] greens and a quarter of an avocado and
[2998.01 - 3002.90] that was my dinner and we also do the
[3000.92 - 3005.30] lentil I do the lentil tacos that's
[3002.90 - 3006.80] really fabulous and easy it's mostly
[3005.30 - 3009.65] chopping it doesn't really take a lot of
[3006.80 - 3010.84] time the potato pancakes we've done for
[3009.65 - 3013.09] a lot of our
[3010.84 - 3015.82] dinner parties those are delicious and
[3013.09 - 3017.11] then ours kind of standard dinners like
[3015.82 - 3019.36] when we're running around we don't have
[3017.11 - 3021.37] time to you know cook or plant a menu is
[3019.36 - 3023.50] just stick and potato and you know in
[3021.37 - 3025.90] the oven or steamed potatoes with some
[3023.50 - 3027.88] kind of steamed veggies and a salad we
[3025.90 - 3029.74] do that a lot or we have a rice dish
[3027.88 - 3031.15] that's really easy to make we'll prepare
[3029.74 - 3033.25] the rice ahead of time and there's this
[3031.15 - 3035.56] great rice here in California called
[3033.25 - 3038.92] Kota Kota farms and it's there it's
[3035.56 - 3040.33] amazing brown rice Wow no I gotta bring
[3038.92 - 3041.86] you a package I'm sorry there was
[3040.33 - 3046.42] something else I was gonna bring into oh
[3041.86 - 3049.99] yeah we'll look out so that we just will
[3046.42 - 3052.72] do rice and then we'll roast a sunflower
[3049.99 - 3055.69] seeds and some sesame seeds in a pan
[3052.72 - 3057.73] with no oil and then we'll take the rice
[3055.69 - 3059.32] and mix the seeds up and put a little
[3057.73 - 3061.30] Bragg's the coconut Bragg's
[3059.32 - 3062.92] in it and it's really delicious and it's
[3061.30 - 3065.07] a great side for you know all the
[3062.92 - 3071.38] vegetables or salads or steamed any
[3065.07 - 3079.75] veggie that you want people mango frozen
[3071.38 - 3083.14] mangos bananas milk tumeric on top of
[3079.75 - 3085.45] that and we do a homemade granola we'll
[3083.14 - 3087.52] mix in with some coconut you know fresh
[3085.45 - 3089.05] coconut that is not fat-free so we'll I
[3087.52 - 3090.61] usually I used to have that in the
[3089.05 - 3091.84] morning but ever since the liver rescue
[3090.61 - 3093.61] came out I do that either in the
[3091.84 - 3095.17] afternoon or sometimes even if I'm
[3093.61 - 3096.43] really tired and I don't feel like
[3095.17 - 3098.29] making dinner I'll do it at night for
[3096.43 - 3102.49] dinner and that'll be it gluten free
[3098.29 - 3104.65] pasta with tomato spinach those kinds of
[3102.49 - 3106.63] things we also just learned that we
[3104.65 - 3108.97] don't we make zoodles we make noodles
[3106.63 - 3110.56] from zucchini yeah and we get to I just
[3108.97 - 3112.15] got like a little doodle you know in a
[3110.56 - 3115.83] little what do they call it where you
[3112.15 - 3118.30] make the spiralizer just to put the
[3115.83 - 3120.19] zucchini in there and you turn it and it
[3118.30 - 3123.10] makes little noodles and I'll make like
[3120.19 - 3124.75] a really fresh red sauce and anything
[3123.10 - 3126.64] that you want to saute if you want it to
[3124.75 - 3128.35] be fat-free like he says and all of his
[3126.64 - 3130.36] lectures and stuff that you can just
[3128.35 - 3132.79] saute your onions and garlic or whatever
[3130.36 - 3134.71] in either water or I use vegetable broth
[3132.79 - 3136.93] that I make from scratch so I freeze a
[3134.71 - 3139.12] lot of vegetable broth and little you
[3136.93 - 3141.58] know jars and then I just defrosted and
[3139.12 - 3143.16] I sauteed in that and then I'll throw
[3141.58 - 3145.17] them in like fresh tomato
[3143.16 - 3146.76] and then you throw the zoodles in and
[3145.17 - 3148.83] you just turn the zoodles over like for
[3146.76 - 3150.33] even a minute and it just barely cooks
[3148.83 - 3152.25] it if you overcook it then it releases
[3150.33 - 3153.72] that sort of zucchini taste which if you
[3152.25 - 3155.55] like that that's great or if you want it
[3153.72 - 3159.48] to be al dente I'm not kidding it tastes
[3155.55 - 3162.48] like capellini pasta yes so great and
[3159.48 - 3165.54] it's agression yummy so we do that once
[3162.48 - 3166.83] in a while and yeah so those are a lot
[3165.54 - 3170.04] of the other things a lot of leafy
[3166.83 - 3171.66] greens that we you know the rest of the
[3170.04 - 3174.27] day it's not just celery juice all day
[3171.66 - 3177.26] that's amazing that's incredible I'm
[3174.27 - 3177.26] like actually getting hungry now
[3182.15 - 3185.67] no that's incredible and people could do
[3184.47 - 3187.08] a little bit of fat you know they can
[3185.67 - 3188.88] put a little bit of their fats they're
[3187.08 - 3190.95] high quality fats in their food it's
[3188.88 - 3192.54] just so much but it's such an over
[3190.95 - 3195.03] an intimidation as that yeah that's
[3192.54 - 3196.53] going on people are overdoing it it's
[3195.03 - 3199.02] like look if you got a chronic illness
[3196.53 - 3200.79] if you got symptoms you don't want there
[3199.02 - 3202.50] if you got you know if you're dealing
[3200.79 - 3204.39] with even acne you mean you're doing
[3202.50 - 3206.19] that or something else you want to make
[3204.39 - 3208.14] sure you lower them or even eliminate
[3206.19 - 3211.29] them for a while art or to maybe like
[3208.14 - 3213.03] exactly one of the you know the 20 day
[3211.29 - 3215.40] cleanse in the first day can keep the
[3213.03 - 3217.32] paxil or whatever it is but yeah yeah no
[3215.40 - 3219.51] that's a credible diet though like
[3217.32 - 3221.40] that's an amazing diet yeah that's kind
[3219.51 - 3223.35] of our our standard and then a lot of
[3221.40 - 3225.78] people are asking are we 100% no we're
[3223.35 - 3228.12] not 100% I mean we make mistakes or we
[3225.78 - 3230.31] yes everybody's everything stuff
[3228.12 - 3231.87] sometimes it yeah sometimes we're like
[3230.31 - 3234.63] we don't have the time to do it or
[3231.87 - 3236.31] whatever but and it's also a process
[3234.63 - 3238.14] like I've been doing this for six years
[3236.31 - 3240.09] so it didn't we didn't get to this place
[3238.14 - 3241.77] where we're at right now two years ago
[3240.09 - 3243.72] you know or four years ago we've been
[3241.77 - 3245.67] slowly shifting and changing and cutting
[3243.72 - 3246.96] more and more things out and we like
[3245.67 - 3249.03] Scott was saying on the way here we eat
[3246.96 - 3250.44] it out at restaurants way way less
[3249.03 - 3252.60] because if you've heard the restaurant
[3250.44 - 3256.44] podcast on restaurants oh that's scary
[3252.60 - 3263.67] but we eat a lot less than when we drew
[3256.44 - 3265.53] and everybody's oh my god but when we
[3263.67 - 3267.60] went to a restaurant about a year ago
[3265.53 - 3269.64] and we had heard about it I'd seen it
[3267.60 - 3270.77] being promoted by a bunch of different
[3269.64 - 3272.60] people on Instagram and different
[3270.77 - 3274.55] places and it was close to her so I was
[3272.60 - 3277.85] like oh yay a new place so we went there
[3274.55 - 3279.35] and I for some reason I got a hit to ask
[3277.85 - 3281.00] a general ill ask do you use control
[3279.35 - 3282.41] oiled and I'll ask questions and you
[3281.00 - 3283.64] know if I see corn on the minyak make
[3282.41 - 3285.65] sure you know please don't put any corn
[3283.64 - 3286.82] on and whatever I'm ordering for some
[3285.65 - 3288.53] reason I asked about nutritional yeast
[3286.82 - 3289.76] and I said well what about then they
[3288.53 - 3291.59] said oh we have a nutritional yeast in
[3289.76 - 3293.93] that like okay what about this literally
[3291.59 - 3296.21] everything on the menu happy release so
[3293.93 - 3298.82] beware of the vegan restaurants I mean I
[3296.21 - 3301.58] know that they're vegan but there can be
[3298.82 - 3302.84] lots of toxic ingredients in vegan well
[3301.58 - 3304.22] you know no one else are pretty even
[3302.84 - 3308.15] even here's the funny everybody thinks
[3304.22 - 3310.46] he's great yeah everything's right all
[3308.15 - 3313.16] the vegans use it they live off of it
[3310.46 - 3316.30] it's disastrous yeah I know people they
[3313.16 - 3319.16] put on a pop yeah it's toxic so oh no
[3316.30 - 3321.74] and be church leaders yeah yeah it's
[3319.16 - 3324.50] it's not it basically it's why it's a
[3321.74 - 3326.15] form of glutamic acid that's what it is
[3324.50 - 3328.55] you can't have nutritional yeast without
[3326.15 - 3330.86] glutamic acid being present so it's like
[3328.55 - 3332.51] a form of MSG you know say you know a
[3330.86 - 3334.19] nutritional yeast company be like no
[3332.51 - 3336.29] there's no MSG in our product there's no
[3334.19 - 3338.27] way we don't have msg in here it's not
[3336.29 - 3340.37] true there's just glutamic acid derives
[3338.27 - 3342.50] from the gusto literally nutritional
[3340.37 - 3344.47] yeast in the way it's created it's just
[3342.50 - 3347.93] it's naturally occurring but it's bad
[3344.47 - 3349.58] and it's toxic so if you know if you're
[3347.93 - 3351.23] putting in a nutritional yeast and
[3349.58 - 3352.58] everything yeah and people will be safe
[3351.23 - 3354.11] why why isn't he talking about
[3352.58 - 3355.94] nutritional miso because if I'm not
[3354.11 - 3357.53] talking about it don't do it
[3355.94 - 3360.26] yeah don't do it that's the whole thing
[3357.53 - 3362.21] and or if I'm talking about it bad like
[3360.26 - 3363.89] I have before I have mentioned don't you
[3362.21 - 3365.99] don't do the nutritional yeast
[3363.89 - 3367.46] it'll slow down your healing if somebody
[3365.99 - 3369.11] be like I did his medical medium
[3367.46 - 3370.49] information I did it for a year it
[3369.11 - 3372.47] didn't move me forward they did
[3370.49 - 3373.16] nutritionally East all the time I got a
[3372.47 - 3376.04] whole thing
[3373.16 - 3378.32] I mean seriously think I don't know this
[3376.04 - 3380.06] like I'm blinking there's a spice in
[3378.32 - 3381.92] that you recommend in a lot of the
[3380.06 - 3384.08] recipes and in the spaghetti bolognaise
[3381.92 - 3385.52] and it's the poultry seasoning and
[3384.08 - 3387.59] remember seeing that - like poultry
[3385.52 - 3388.58] seasoning what because I'm thinking
[3387.59 - 3390.02] there's poultry nut but then of course
[3388.58 - 3393.68] you read the ingredients and it's just a
[3390.02 - 3396.05] bunch of herbs and it's it's there it's
[3393.68 - 3397.58] recommended for some of the recipes so I
[3396.05 - 3398.87] would think whatever you're putting
[3397.58 - 3400.01] nutritional yeast on get rid of the
[3398.87 - 3401.81] nutritional yeast and maybe try the
[3400.01 - 3403.22] poultry seasoning on stuff you'll have a
[3401.81 - 3403.47] better shot with it you know the thing
[3403.22 - 3406.38] is
[3403.47 - 3408.66] with msg it's it sneaks into everything
[3406.38 - 3410.64] it sneaks into all these different
[3408.66 - 3411.66] things and what happens is migraines
[3410.64 - 3413.82] nutritional yeast
[3411.66 - 3415.83] it can give you migraines it can give
[3413.82 - 3417.63] you headaches it can up your anxiety
[3415.83 - 3418.98] game you can do all these different
[3417.63 - 3421.38] things even if you're just using a
[3418.98 - 3423.12] little bit same with natural flavors
[3421.38 - 3424.89] it's another thing someone will say yeah
[3423.12 - 3426.30] look I did medical medium information
[3424.89 - 3428.22] for a month and it helped me a little
[3426.30 - 3429.99] bit but didn't take me all the way they
[3428.22 - 3432.27] were doing natural flavors and 10 items
[3429.99 - 3436.05] I mean I've talked to people that do
[3432.27 - 3438.06] everything labors and also like natural
[3436.05 - 3441.03] vanilla flavor natural almond labor
[3438.06 - 3443.16] right yeah you know what extract is not
[3441.03 - 3445.68] a natural flavoring that's not an MSG
[3443.16 - 3447.48] based you know flavoring so vanilla
[3445.68 - 3450.96] extract is different but vanilla
[3447.48 - 3453.90] flavoring you know a flavoring organic
[3450.96 - 3456.72] flavoring is msg if you see organic
[3453.90 - 3459.18] flavors that's msg if you see all of
[3456.72 - 3462.93] that if you see the word flavor flavors
[3459.18 - 3465.30] or flavoring all three of those if you
[3462.93 - 3468.17] see berry flavor strawberry flavor
[3465.30 - 3471.12] that's msg if you see raspberry flavor
[3468.17 - 3473.70] msg doesn't matter if you see a product
[3471.12 - 3475.38] it says no GMO all whatever all
[3473.70 - 3477.57] plant-based all whatever it is the whole
[3475.38 - 3478.14] thing and there's flavor yeah in there
[3477.57 - 3481.53] somewhere
[3478.14 - 3483.75] that's msg that's how it's done so you
[3481.53 - 3485.04] know and people don't know that so
[3483.75 - 3486.51] they're getting the natural flavors
[3485.04 - 3490.26] they're pounding the nutritional yeast
[3486.51 - 3492.42] are doing the high fats you know they do
[3490.26 - 3494.58] the celery juice for two weeks and go on
[3492.42 - 3496.32] YouTube and say why I quit celery juice
[3494.58 - 3499.44] after two weeks meanwhile celery juice
[3496.32 - 3501.66] to save countless lives yeah around the
[3499.44 - 3503.73] globe literally from death defying
[3501.66 - 3505.74] diseases so there's so much
[3503.73 - 3508.20] misinformation and how it works and how
[3505.74 - 3510.21] it's all set up out there it's
[3508.20 - 3513.00] incredible so I mean but yeah that's a
[3510.21 - 3516.51] really good thing boys are we are we
[3513.00 - 3518.04] close to being over I think yeah we're
[3516.51 - 3519.63] close do you want to say we're close
[3518.04 - 3521.04] we're almost at an hour do you want to
[3519.63 - 3523.20] say anything about disinformation
[3521.04 - 3525.30] or misinformation that's out there yeah
[3523.20 - 3527.21] absolutely because it's hard sometimes I
[3525.30 - 3529.59] think it's hard for people to discern
[3527.21 - 3531.17] whether it's misinformation and there is
[3529.59 - 3533.88] so much information out there it's crazy
[3531.17 - 3536.55] for me I just follow what Anthony says
[3533.88 - 3538.14] that's how like that's how I I am
[3536.55 - 3539.22] dissect the misinformation and people
[3538.14 - 3540.45] ask me all the time what about this one
[3539.22 - 3541.95] that I'm like I don't know if it's in
[3540.45 - 3543.78] the book if he's talking about it that's
[3541.95 - 3545.25] what I do if he's not I just let it go
[3543.78 - 3547.83] misinformation has been out there for
[3545.25 - 3550.95] decades people been sick for decades
[3547.83 - 3553.20] because of it it's not new it's just
[3550.95 - 3557.31] that the younger people haven't learned
[3553.20 - 3560.01] yet yeah but the people who are 50 or 40
[3557.31 - 3560.94] they medically the hell or 60 they've
[3560.01 - 3563.22] been through the hell they've been
[3560.94 - 3564.90] through years of misinformation finally
[3563.22 - 3566.67] found the right source which is the
[3564.90 - 3569.70] American medium information finally knew
[3566.67 - 3571.56] how to heal meanwhile when you're young
[3569.70 - 3574.02] you're just gonna get swamped in all
[3571.56 - 3576.57] that misinformation because every 10
[3574.02 - 3579.21] years everybody forgets that the whole
[3576.57 - 3580.92] Candida theory didn't work they know
[3579.21 - 3583.26] they keep on forgetting and they
[3580.92 - 3585.09] repackage and remain things and then
[3583.26 - 3587.52] they threw like the lectin thing at you
[3585.09 - 3588.99] which is actually all rubbish then they
[3587.52 - 3590.28] throw something else at you and then
[3588.99 - 3592.44] they throw something else at you then
[3590.28 - 3594.30] they think it's endless and you just get
[3592.44 - 3598.17] tangled up in the misinformation and
[3594.30 - 3601.02] it's all backed by paid-for studies when
[3598.17 - 3603.81] you can I could get a paid for stuff
[3601.02 - 3605.58] sort of me you can get a pay for I think
[3603.81 - 3608.22] it a paid for study and make it look
[3605.58 - 3610.71] like oh okay this is now cited rice is a
[3608.22 - 3613.56] paid for study all you need is money and
[3610.71 - 3615.39] then you do the money okay and then you
[3613.56 - 3617.79] get the study done yeah and then you
[3615.39 - 3620.52] haven't support your cause which you
[3617.79 - 3622.38] will make money that's the game so all
[3620.52 - 3625.14] the things that are out there are all
[3622.38 - 3627.30] contaminated with the bad bad game yeah
[3625.14 - 3628.80] Ford for for reason
[3627.30 - 3631.08] that's the whole reason that's a whole
[3628.80 - 3633.69] new kombucha tea all of that that's all
[3631.08 - 3635.16] backed everything's backed and then you
[3633.69 - 3636.72] just go into the trends and then you
[3635.16 - 3638.52] just get sucked into the trends and the
[3636.72 - 3638.91] painfulness information and all the sort
[3638.52 - 3641.07] of stuff
[3638.91 - 3644.58] this information is pure untampered with
[3641.07 - 3650.16] and look be open to it so you can work
[3644.58 - 3652.50] on healing because I love to always bark
[3650.16 - 3655.50] that out and you don't have the same
[3652.50 - 3659.81] agenda as a lot of these so that's a
[3655.50 - 3662.55] huge difference okay anyway if you like
