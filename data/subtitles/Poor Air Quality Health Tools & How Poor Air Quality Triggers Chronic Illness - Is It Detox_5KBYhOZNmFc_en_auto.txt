[0.00 - 5.04] matter if you don't have any symptoms or
[2.82 - 7.98] conditions you have nothing wrong with
[5.04 - 9.18] you at least in the moment maybe down
[7.98 - 11.04] the road you'll have something wrong
[9.18 - 12.00] with you because everybody's going to
[11.04 - 15.18] have something wrong with them
[12.00 - 16.92] regardless of what's going on but
[15.18 - 18.30] it could be a trigger that you're
[16.92 - 20.10] sensitive to because there's lots of
[18.30 - 22.08] triggers out there all over the place
[20.10 - 23.64] everywhere one of the triggers that's
[22.08 - 25.14] happening right now for people that's
[23.64 - 26.10] not good for their health because of
[25.14 - 28.20] what they're struggling with and
[26.10 - 31.02] everything else is environmental
[28.20 - 33.20] disaster air quality stuff going on
[31.02 - 35.04] fires
[33.20 - 37.28] fires right
[35.04 - 43.58] fires that have been saying for years
[37.28 - 43.58] are not just naturally caused
[43.68 - 47.34] so and that's a whole other story but
[45.84 - 50.10] regardless
[47.34 - 52.26] fires that are happening is a big
[50.10 - 54.42] problem and it isn't just the smoke
[52.26 - 57.12] itself
[54.42 - 59.70] it's the Smoke Plus
[57.12 - 62.58] so many other things burning within that
[59.70 - 65.16] fire so it's not just the wood smoke of
[62.58 - 70.02] the trees and the leaves and the woods
[65.16 - 72.96] it's more than that it's much more it's
[70.02 - 75.66] when junk in the woods gets lit up with
[72.96 - 79.14] it it's when houses get lit up with it
[75.66 - 83.28] with all that treated lumber
[79.14 - 85.32] and then it's all of the fire flame
[83.28 - 87.66] retardants that are dropped over and
[85.32 - 89.94] over and over again from the sky onto
[87.66 - 91.80] the fires and that stuff travels
[89.94 - 94.80] hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of
[91.80 - 97.56] miles and it's in the air and it's just
[94.80 - 100.68] white powder that's floating in the air
[97.56 - 103.26] and it floats endlessly endlessly
[100.68 - 105.00] endlessly and then we breathe it in so
[103.26 - 106.08] I'm talking about air quality tools but
[105.00 - 107.52] I'm going to talk about some other stuff
[106.08 - 109.20] too because there's lots of triggers
[107.52 - 112.44] that bring people down and bring their
[109.20 - 115.02] health down and brings them to such you
[112.44 - 117.36] know a susceptible place and we don't
[115.02 - 120.24] want to be so susceptible
[117.36 - 121.74] we want to be empowered no matter what
[120.24 - 124.14] we're up against no matter what we're
[121.74 - 126.36] breathing in no matter what we're seeing
[124.14 - 131.04] no matter what's going on in our life we
[126.36 - 133.56] want to be empowered and strengthened
[131.04 - 135.00] and that's really a critical part of it
[133.56 - 136.62] anyway you guys
[135.00 - 138.60] I want to talk a little bit about all of
[136.62 - 142.86] it I have a PDF
[138.60 - 147.66] and it's not 99 and it's not 250 dollars
[142.86 - 152.10] and it's not 39.99 the PDF is free
[147.66 - 154.26] it costs money to make I had to have a
[152.10 - 156.78] whole team working on it
[154.26 - 158.58] it's an incredible PDF
[156.78 - 159.92] and it's free
[158.58 - 162.84] free free
[159.92 - 164.76] because it's not always about the money
[162.84 - 167.22] it's about making sure you can provide
[164.76 - 170.28] whatever you can for people so they got
[167.22 - 172.08] every fighting chance so I wanted to
[170.28 - 174.60] make sure I do another free pdf
[172.08 - 176.70] environmental disaster air quality tools
[174.60 - 178.98] by Anthony William
[176.70 - 181.98] the medical medium
[178.98 - 184.70] it's a free download
[181.98 - 188.04] medicalmedium.com
[184.70 - 190.20] environmental disaster air quality tools
[188.04 - 192.42] environmental disasters happen all the
[190.20 - 194.10] time on this planet
[192.42 - 196.14] purposely
[194.10 - 198.66] or not on purpose
[196.14 - 202.26] causing the air to become polluted and
[198.66 - 204.60] toxic often from smoke burning and fires
[202.26 - 206.76] it's not just the smoke itself that
[204.60 - 208.80] causes harm to our health but also the
[206.76 - 210.24] chemicals in other toxins that are in
[208.80 - 212.88] the air
[210.24 - 214.32] the link is in the profile and the link
[212.88 - 216.36] is in the description you can download
[214.32 - 219.42] it free right there right in the link in
[216.36 - 221.28] the profile description how cool is that
[219.42 - 223.44] it's not just the smoke itself that
[221.28 - 225.24] causes harm to our health but also the
[223.44 - 226.26] chemicals and other toxins that are in
[225.24 - 230.58] the air
[226.26 - 233.10] for example when a building Burns there
[230.58 - 235.26] are countless chemicals that burn and
[233.10 - 238.14] get into the air or when fire retardants
[235.26 - 241.62] are sprayed dumped on the fires
[238.14 - 245.10] endlessly their chemicals in that float
[241.62 - 246.78] around forever toxic heavy metals are
[245.10 - 248.94] one of the thing that's in those Flame
[246.78 - 250.74] retardants
[248.94 - 252.90] and they become a part of the dust and
[250.74 - 256.08] smoke that people and animals are all
[252.90 - 257.22] breathing in all the time you may be
[256.08 - 258.42] somebody that's like well you know what
[257.22 - 259.80] I don't need to watch this right now
[258.42 - 261.12] because I'm not dealing with any kind of
[259.80 - 262.50] fire stuff but I'm going to talk about
[261.12 - 264.66] other triggers I'm going to talk about
[262.50 - 266.40] sensitivities
[264.66 - 269.96] things that break down our immune system
[266.40 - 269.96] and make us susceptible
[270.12 - 273.60] aside from causing a more obvious
[271.86 - 278.10] breathing and lung issues poor air
[273.60 - 280.32] quality can lower the immune system what
[278.10 - 282.60] poor air quality can lower the immune
[280.32 - 284.46] system and be a trigger to all kinds of
[282.60 - 286.92] chronic illnesses symptoms and
[284.46 - 288.96] conditions both in the short term and
[286.92 - 290.52] long after the environmental disaster or
[288.96 - 292.50] exposure has occurred so here's the
[290.52 - 294.06] thing you might be out of the woods by
[292.50 - 296.76] now maybe you don't smell anything
[294.06 - 298.40] anymore but then something kind of
[296.76 - 301.20] develops later
[298.40 - 302.28] Aftershock it's kind of like that car
[301.20 - 304.92] accident
[302.28 - 307.50] that you were in
[304.92 - 309.30] everything felt fine
[307.50 - 310.56] you open your car door you got out
[309.30 - 313.86] you're like wait a minute I think I'm
[310.56 - 315.48] okay I think I'm all right okay let me
[313.86 - 317.58] just go find out this person's insurance
[315.48 - 320.46] information maybe we'll call the police
[317.58 - 323.16] and have a you know traffic cop out here
[320.46 - 324.48] and everything's good you go home you
[323.16 - 326.70] don't need to go to a hospital you go
[324.48 - 329.34] home and then it hits you as the night
[326.70 - 331.52] goes on or the next day or two weeks
[329.34 - 331.52] later
[334.26 - 340.14] so our immune system can be lowered
[338.10 - 341.88] triggering chronic illness symptoms
[340.14 - 343.74] conditions both in the short term and
[341.88 - 345.66] long after the environmental disaster or
[343.74 - 347.70] exposure has occurred guys are wondering
[345.66 - 350.40] what I'm reading reading the free pdf
[347.70 - 352.86] you can download link is in a profile
[350.40 - 355.32] link is in the description good to see
[352.86 - 357.30] you guys by the way
[355.32 - 359.22] One Way pollutants in the air can be
[357.30 - 361.32] problematic is because they not only
[359.22 - 363.66] lower the immune system
[361.32 - 365.58] yeah
[363.66 - 368.22] lower the immune system they also
[365.58 - 371.10] provide food for viruses
[368.22 - 374.00] that then release neurotoxins and
[371.10 - 374.00] dermatoxins
[374.10 - 378.54] mm info has been all about viruses for
[376.68 - 382.52] years and years and years decades and
[378.54 - 382.52] now everybody they're a virus genius now
[383.82 - 388.26] symptoms and conditions such as
[385.68 - 390.24] headaches and migraines fatigue eczema
[388.26 - 392.16] psoriasis aches and pain sleep problems
[390.24 - 394.68] autoimmune disorders brain fog and so
[392.16 - 396.36] much more a flare-up and worsening of
[394.68 - 397.98] symptoms and conditions you already have
[396.36 - 400.26] struggled with or currently struggle
[397.98 - 402.18] with or the onset of new symptoms and
[400.26 - 405.18] conditions can occur especially after
[402.18 - 407.10] heavier prolonged exposure to poor air
[405.18 - 408.36] quality or if your immune system is
[407.10 - 410.28] already struggling sounds like a drug
[408.36 - 414.32] commercial almost like
[410.28 - 414.32] right look out for side effects
[417.24 - 421.44] your side effects may be bleeding your
[418.86 - 423.18] side effects may be
[421.44 - 424.32] what happens is that people don't
[423.18 - 425.40] realize what they're dealing with
[424.32 - 428.04] they're dealing with a lot of different
[425.40 - 429.78] viruses inside their body low grade
[428.04 - 432.36] viral issues
[429.78 - 434.22] bacterial like streptococcus those
[432.36 - 436.86] things amp up when your immune system
[434.22 - 439.98] drops so we walk around with our immune
[436.86 - 441.84] system hopefully intact and strong and
[439.98 - 443.34] then as our immune system drops and it
[441.84 - 446.12] gets triggered by chemicals and
[443.34 - 449.88] pollutants in the air and all that then
[446.12 - 452.28] viral issues rise up
[449.88 - 454.68] Dr Fawn says it's true nowadays when you
[452.28 - 456.24] Google autoimmune disease plus EBV there
[454.68 - 458.28] are so many articles one to two years
[456.24 - 459.66] ago it wasn't there four years ago
[458.28 - 464.40] definitely wasn't there five years ago
[459.66 - 467.06] no MM info putting it out there
[464.40 - 467.06] yep
[468.00 - 472.20] we don't need to be fearful of these
[470.46 - 475.02] kinds of events out there that happen
[472.20 - 477.54] and their impact on our health they're
[475.02 - 481.32] outside of our control
[477.54 - 483.42] we can't control we can think of fire to
[481.32 - 485.22] not happen we can try to stop a fire
[483.42 - 487.02] with our mind
[485.22 - 489.90] we can stand there on the edge of the
[487.02 - 492.24] woods and just say fire die down
[489.90 - 493.98] and we can use every single thing we
[492.24 - 496.68] have we can use our psychic of power
[493.98 - 498.66] that powerful psychic abilities we can
[496.68 - 500.04] try to stop that fire but it doesn't
[498.66 - 502.40] mean you're going to be able to stop it
[500.04 - 502.40] that way
[502.62 - 506.90] some things are going to be out of our
[504.54 - 506.90] control
[506.94 - 513.24] and these fires that are started by
[509.64 - 515.46] evildoers or just started because two
[513.24 - 518.04] bunny rabbits in the woods
[515.46 - 520.70] we're rubbing two sticks together and
[518.04 - 520.70] started a fire
[524.64 - 529.52] I think this
[526.32 - 531.78] natural fire disaster that's taken over
[529.52 - 534.48] thousands upon thousands of countless
[531.78 - 537.60] Acres was started with two bunny rabbits
[534.48 - 541.44] that were trying to start the fire by
[537.60 - 543.90] whittling together two pieces of wood
[541.44 - 546.12] because they were cold because you
[543.90 - 547.86] believe everything right
[546.12 - 549.24] just put it on the news two bunny
[547.86 - 552.30] rabbits
[549.24 - 553.92] were chilly that night and they were and
[552.30 - 556.02] they were rubbing sticks together and
[553.92 - 559.28] they started the fire that's what our
[556.02 - 559.28] research has shown
[561.60 - 566.28] we don't need to be fearful of these
[563.58 - 568.44] kinds of events
[566.28 - 571.20] and other events too that happened you
[568.44 - 575.52] remember Fukushima
[571.20 - 577.02] yeah what was it 2011 Fukushima all that
[575.52 - 579.18] radiation heading to the West Coast
[577.02 - 582.42] heading to California
[579.18 - 586.16] oh all that radiation particle just
[582.42 - 586.16] heading to California coast in Hawaii
[586.68 - 590.58] people in Hawaii would glow in the dark
[588.72 - 594.18] after that
[590.58 - 596.16] I just it's unbelievable really when you
[594.18 - 598.74] think about it
[596.16 - 601.20] that's why it's critical to do some of
[598.74 - 603.78] the medical medium tools because to work
[601.20 - 607.08] on like radiation exposure
[603.78 - 610.32] I have a friend that lives in Hawaii
[607.08 - 611.76] and they're still doing my friend is
[610.32 - 614.22] still in their family are still doing
[611.76 - 617.34] medical medium tools for anti-radiation
[614.22 - 619.50] and everything else
[617.34 - 621.66] because of that whole Fukushima thing
[619.50 - 623.58] there and it's not like anybody told
[621.66 - 625.92] everybody in Hawaii like you might want
[623.58 - 629.12] to leave Hawaii for a little while but
[625.92 - 629.12] no that's not how it works
[629.58 - 634.94] we're off the beaten path right now so
[631.56 - 634.94] hang on we'll get back on the path
[636.84 - 641.46] we need to be equipped and empowered for
[638.88 - 644.04] those times when we do have to live with
[641.46 - 646.02] poor air quality and toxic exposures and
[644.04 - 647.82] give our bodies the extra care they need
[646.02 - 651.06] you guys if you just got on here reading
[647.82 - 653.16] this incredible PDF I printed it out you
[651.06 - 657.06] can print it out download it for free
[653.16 - 660.24] it's not 39.99 or anything else it's for
[657.06 - 661.86] free and it's a killer one it's packed
[660.24 - 666.24] I'll talk a little bit about what it has
[661.86 - 666.24] in it but it's jammed jam-packed

[684.72 - 689.46] on this planet
[686.82 - 692.10] and we need tools like this which is
[689.46 - 694.44] great which is great
[692.10 - 696.32] so I want to make one of the tools if

[813.66 - 820.46] I'm gonna put it on top of here so let
[816.24 - 820.46] me just get it into my little strainer
[825.18 - 830.28] don't use hot water just you know just
[827.64 - 834.54] regular temperature water
[830.28 - 837.42] and I will definitely not
[834.54 - 842.24] and I repeat not
[837.42 - 842.24] spill it on my PDF I just print it out
[846.36 - 849.48] so I'm going to let that sleep for 15
[847.80 - 851.52] minutes that's what you do this is so
[849.48 - 855.32] simple
[851.52 - 855.32] but it's powerful
[855.36 - 861.48] don't underestimate ever
[858.42 - 864.90] lemon ginger and honey
[861.48 - 868.02] in water don't underestimate it it's
[864.90 - 870.12] powerful makes a difference big
[868.02 - 872.64] difference all right
[870.12 - 874.26] I want to show you this little trick too
[872.64 - 875.70] before we talk about that as well first
[874.26 - 877.02] of all I got my celery juice right here
[875.70 - 880.20] it's been sitting for a little while
[877.02 - 881.82] made it earlier you know how it settled
[880.20 - 884.04] sometimes right we can shake it up
[881.82 - 886.92] before you drink it celery juice that's
[884.04 - 889.80] another powerful tool for when you're
[886.92 - 891.30] dealing with immune system antagonizers
[889.80 - 893.30] because that's what I call it so not
[891.30 - 895.32] just air quality issues or immune system
[893.30 - 896.52] antagonizers but so many other things
[895.32 - 899.82] are too
[896.52 - 901.62] and um I love that celery juice for that
[899.82 - 904.62] it's about keeping our immune system
[901.62 - 906.84] strong why why even bother keeping our
[904.62 - 909.48] immune system strong what's the what's
[906.84 - 912.06] the reason who cares who cares if
[909.48 - 914.64] everybody's immune system gets dropped
[912.06 - 918.96] or gets tackled
[914.64 - 921.06] or starts to break down who cares
[918.96 - 923.34] we should all care so when our immune
[921.06 - 926.34] system starts to break down
[923.34 - 928.38]  hits the fan and we have to be
[926.34 - 930.66] careful we want our immune system nice
[928.38 - 933.84] and strong we want it to do its job
[930.66 - 935.28] wanted to conquer Invaders so I'm
[933.84 - 936.72] letting this steep for a little bit I
[935.28 - 938.90] want to show you this little trick right
[936.72 - 938.90] here
[939.12 - 942.90] now I know there's a lot of people out
[940.62 - 946.08] there just freaking out about masks
[942.90 - 949.32] right there's a massive mask War out
[946.08 - 950.94] there Mass need Master mask right don't
[949.32 - 953.64] wear masks ever they're killing you
[950.94 - 955.74] master good Master bad Master's doing
[953.64 - 957.00] bad bad good bad bad everyone wants to
[955.74 - 958.68] kill each other
[957.00 - 963.18] over masks
[958.68 - 964.56] this is not a freaking mask
[963.18 - 966.96] so I just want to make that clear
[964.56 - 968.04] because someone's going to think this is
[966.96 - 969.96] a mask
[968.04 - 972.78] and then they're going to want to cancel
[969.96 - 977.82] aw over that
[972.78 - 979.98] this is a wet cloth right
[977.82 - 982.08] so
[979.98 - 983.34] see doesn't even ring out oh it rings
[982.08 - 985.26] out a little bit
[983.34 - 987.24] so it's nice and
[985.26 - 989.52] nice and good
[987.24 - 991.86] so what am I doing with this
[989.52 - 993.78] this is an incredible tool right here
[991.86 - 995.88] when you're dealing with smoke and smoke
[993.78 - 997.98] pollutants all that inhalants all that
[995.88 - 1000.68] stuff all the toxins that are in the air
[997.98 - 1003.92] from the fires
[1000.68 - 1007.28] right here now somebody
[1003.92 - 1008.66] who's really really smart
[1007.28 - 1011.18] they believe they're really smart
[1008.66 - 1013.16] they're going to say how is this going
[1011.18 - 1016.94] to filter smoke
[1013.16 - 1020.36] it's thin it's a dish cloth washed towel
[1016.94 - 1020.36] whatever washcloth
[1020.48 - 1025.34] how is it going to do it what happens is
[1022.64 - 1028.70] when you wet it
[1025.34 - 1031.28] it swells the cotton
[1028.70 - 1033.98] it swells the fabric
[1031.28 - 1035.66] and it swells it together like it
[1033.98 - 1038.30] spreads it out
[1035.66 - 1040.52] so this is important to know
[1038.30 - 1044.72] and then when it's wet
[1040.52 - 1047.84] the moisture is what captures the flame
[1044.72 - 1049.70] retardants the dust the pollution the
[1047.84 - 1052.48] sea trails
[1049.70 - 1052.48] the whatever
[1052.64 - 1058.94] now it's not perfect
[1055.16 - 1061.34] by any means some will escape but it
[1058.94 - 1062.30] brings it down greatly if you're in a
[1061.34 - 1064.46] serious
[1062.30 - 1066.74] situation especially if you're running
[1064.46 - 1068.42] from the house to the car especially if
[1066.74 - 1070.76] you're you know if you're out somewhere
[1068.42 - 1072.98] whatever it is and you're stuck in it if
[1070.76 - 1076.40] you have a bottle of water and you have
[1072.98 - 1079.46] a piece of cloth even a t-shirt in your
[1076.40 - 1081.86] car whatever and you wet that it's
[1079.46 - 1084.14] really powerful
[1081.86 - 1087.14] and so what you can do with this
[1084.14 - 1088.40] is you can put it just like this
[1087.14 - 1090.74] now what you're doing is you're giving
[1088.40 - 1093.38] yourself lots of room in there so you're
[1090.74 - 1097.58] making a pocket in there
[1093.38 - 1100.22] and those pollutants that smoke that Ash
[1097.58 - 1101.66] those flame retardants those chemicals
[1100.22 - 1103.82] all of it
[1101.66 - 1105.62] start getting trapped
[1103.82 - 1108.86] in here
[1105.62 - 1111.92] because the moisture is what does it
[1108.86 - 1114.56] if this was dry it wouldn't do it
[1111.92 - 1116.96] it just would not work the fabric
[1114.56 - 1118.70] wouldn't swell
[1116.96 - 1122.12] because that's what it does it like
[1118.70 - 1123.98] swells itself shut when it's wet
[1122.12 - 1126.62] and so as you're breathing you're
[1123.98 - 1127.58] pulling in all that stuff through the
[1126.62 - 1130.04] water
[1127.58 - 1133.28] in the fabric the water is what captures
[1130.04 - 1135.92] everything so it has to be moist like
[1133.28 - 1139.52] that don't
[1135.92 - 1142.28] run towards a fire in the smoke and be
[1139.52 - 1144.68] like it doesn't matter I have I have my
[1142.28 - 1146.96] wet towel I'm gonna go find some fire
[1144.68 - 1149.00] I'm gonna go find somebody's fire pit
[1146.96 - 1152.72] then go look over the fire pit and just
[1149.00 - 1154.36] like don't do that whatever you do
[1152.72 - 1156.92] but
[1154.36 - 1159.68] Death By A Thousand Cuts
[1156.92 - 1161.66] quiet Roseman says
[1159.68 - 1165.62] IG
[1161.66 - 1166.94] Death By A Thousand Cuts medical medium
[1165.62 - 1169.88] term
[1166.94 - 1170.96] used in health regard regarding to our
[1169.88 - 1172.82] health
[1170.96 - 1174.56] breaking down our immune system breaking
[1172.82 - 1177.38] down our body breaking down our organs
[1174.56 - 1179.42] all the different cuts out there I can
[1177.38 - 1182.36] name so many in a row really quick too
[1179.42 - 1184.52] it's not even just stuff like that or
[1182.36 - 1187.46] triggers but stuff that's out there that
[1184.52 - 1189.50] people are using every day
[1187.46 - 1190.88] there's so many triggers out there that
[1189.50 - 1192.50] don't help us there's so many different
[1190.88 - 1194.12] things that are not that are not helpful
[1192.50 - 1196.94] right let's finish making this right
[1194.12 - 1199.64] here if you guys don't mind
[1196.94 - 1202.12] straining this
[1199.64 - 1202.12] okay
[1202.40 - 1210.34] 210 15 minutes I like 15 minutes
[1206.48 - 1210.34] that should be pretty good right there
[1211.82 - 1218.20] get a lemon in here I'm gonna squeeze
[1214.04 - 1218.20] some lemon in here it's like this
[1226.22 - 1230.74] of course I got lemon juice on my PBF
[1231.26 - 1236.32] all right and then we're gonna get some
[1233.54 - 1236.32] honey in here too
[1239.72 - 1243.22] I like doing things live
[1243.44 - 1248.78] cut cut gotta edit that we got to do an
[1246.08 - 1250.40] edit you guys we gotta edit this
[1248.78 - 1251.78] I don't want that on there for everybody
[1250.40 - 1254.86] to see
[1251.78 - 1254.86] I want it to be perfect
[1256.34 - 1263.06] lemon honey ginger water
[1258.86 - 1265.22] honey is antimicrobial antibacterial
[1263.06 - 1267.44] but it's more than that it's glucose
[1265.22 - 1270.40] glucose protects the brain when you're
[1267.44 - 1270.40] in fear
[1270.86 - 1275.12] it's a glucose it's so easy to get to
[1273.86 - 1278.06] the brain
[1275.12 - 1279.86] honey goes right to the brain and then
[1278.06 - 1282.14] you got all the trace minerals
[1279.86 - 1285.14] phytochemical compounds
[1282.14 - 1288.64] and the liver too mm info the glucose
[1285.14 - 1288.64] that's preserved in the liver
[1288.92 - 1294.08] all of that right
[1291.14 - 1296.30] the liver helps flush out toxins too
[1294.08 - 1298.04] that's what it does the liver helps to
[1296.30 - 1300.62] flush out toxins
[1298.04 - 1302.60] and then more glucose is used out of
[1300.62 - 1307.30] your liver the body needs the glucose
[1302.60 - 1307.30] the honey is a great source of glucose
[1307.58 - 1314.00] regenerator
[1310.22 - 1314.00] storm okay
[1314.66 - 1318.74] I like trying to use some different
[1316.10 - 1321.80] words right sometimes they're not so
[1318.74 - 1324.44] great but they're good enough I think
[1321.80 - 1327.58] all right so that's this can I sip this
[1324.44 - 1327.58] if you guys don't mind
[1328.04 - 1333.98] that's so good ah I love it
[1331.88 - 1336.38] love that very much
[1333.98 - 1338.06] all right
[1336.38 - 1338.90] so I want to go through this PDF a
[1338.06 - 1341.00] little bit for a couple of minutes
[1338.90 - 1344.30] before I read a little bit more
[1341.00 - 1346.16] so what I really like about this PDF is
[1344.30 - 1347.78] you got the seven top supplements right
[1346.16 - 1349.94] there
[1347.78 - 1354.10] and you'll see them I have them out here
[1349.94 - 1357.38] seven top supplements four air quality
[1354.10 - 1358.88] problems immune system building all of
[1357.38 - 1361.46] it you got the propolis right there you
[1358.88 - 1363.26] got the B12 you got the zinc you got the
[1361.46 - 1365.06] micro C you got the glutathione it's
[1363.26 - 1366.62] incredible for detoxification right
[1365.06 - 1370.76] there
[1366.62 - 1372.50] helps the body to naturally detox bodies
[1370.76 - 1374.24] that are sick and filled with garbage
[1372.50 - 1375.92] and filled with junk livers that are
[1374.24 - 1378.50] sick and filled with garbage and filled
[1375.92 - 1381.38] with junk for years decades
[1378.50 - 1382.76] and then on top of that we get problems
[1381.38 - 1385.40] where all of a sudden we're breathing in
[1382.76 - 1387.02] all the fire smoke or breathing in Sea
[1385.40 - 1388.82] Trails that's another one all on its own
[1387.02 - 1391.82] all the sea trails that were inhaling
[1388.82 - 1394.76] and breathing in dumping on us we live
[1391.82 - 1396.08] in it it's being you know dropped on us
[1394.76 - 1398.30] every day
[1396.08 - 1400.40] so I love things like the glutathione
[1398.30 - 1402.20] that's the Imaging one you guys know I
[1400.40 - 1403.22] endorse these guys the best stuff out
[1402.20 - 1406.76] there
[1403.22 - 1408.92] and that's the micro C doesn't burn a
[1406.76 - 1410.90] hole in your stomach
[1408.92 - 1413.44] when someone says vitamin C to me I'm
[1410.90 - 1413.44] always just like
[1413.66 - 1418.64] vitamin C really yeah yeah I'm on
[1416.00 - 1421.16] vitamin C really I hope you're not
[1418.64 - 1423.86] burning a hole in your gut
[1421.16 - 1427.22] with that ascorbic acid and so I love
[1423.86 - 1429.86] about the vermergy micro C it's not all
[1427.22 - 1431.36] that ascorbic acid so hard on the
[1429.86 - 1433.40] stomach so hard on the intestinal
[1431.36 - 1434.96] Linings you know to worry about that
[1433.40 - 1436.88] with people
[1434.96 - 1438.56] when they're doing vitamin C out there
[1436.88 - 1442.58] and they think they got a good vitamin C
[1438.56 - 1444.56] and it's just like eek eek so we got the
[1442.58 - 1446.66] zinc liquid zinc sulfate where we got
[1444.56 - 1450.26] that one we got the B12 we got the
[1446.66 - 1452.42] propolis so good all of those immune
[1450.26 - 1453.92] system Builders keeping our immune
[1452.42 - 1456.26] system strong
[1453.92 - 1459.20] and it matters because what happens
[1456.26 - 1461.48] after we breathe in toxins and poisons
[1459.20 - 1464.24] and environmental junk and garbage and
[1461.48 - 1465.92] everything else and sea trails and Flame
[1464.24 - 1467.84] retardants and that's just some things
[1465.92 - 1470.78] and pesticides herbicides whatever it is
[1467.84 - 1472.82] that we're breathing in or taking in
[1470.78 - 1475.64] especially if it's burning
[1472.82 - 1477.62] whatever it is it drops the immune
[1475.64 - 1479.60] system why because our immune cells have
[1477.62 - 1481.46] to gobble it up
[1479.60 - 1484.22] and that's something people don't
[1481.46 - 1487.34] realize that our immune cells have to
[1484.22 - 1489.74] eat all the garbage and junk so if
[1487.34 - 1491.78] you're breathing in smoke all of the
[1489.74 - 1494.00] immune cells in the body are now just
[1491.78 - 1496.16] eating smoke that's all it's doing and
[1494.00 - 1498.02] then the ball is dropped
[1496.16 - 1500.78] that's how it goes wrong it's one thing
[1498.02 - 1502.22] to say oh yeah immune system yeah I
[1500.78 - 1505.58] learned something the other day you know
[1502.22 - 1507.80] the immune system is uh it weakens when
[1505.58 - 1510.50] you breathe in fire
[1507.80 - 1512.36] I heard some guy talking
[1510.50 - 1514.22] um when you breathe in bad stuff your
[1512.36 - 1515.66] immune system has a problem right it's
[1514.22 - 1517.40] one thing to look at it that way it's
[1515.66 - 1521.54] another to know why it's because your
[1517.40 - 1524.84] immune cells are eating all of that crap
[1521.54 - 1528.82] that was in that smoke that smoke enters
[1524.84 - 1528.82] into your body
[1528.98 - 1533.60] it's like you know go to a barbecue or
[1531.26 - 1537.26] go to a barbecue restaurant and they're
[1533.60 - 1540.68] smoking or like yeah we use oak wood to
[1537.26 - 1542.86] smoke our pigs and look let's open up
[1540.68 - 1545.60] this big old thing
[1542.86 - 1548.54] there it is right there we got a whole
[1545.60 - 1551.06] half a pig here we got a whole brisket
[1548.54 - 1553.04] here we got a whole another half a pig
[1551.06 - 1555.44] we got two turkeys here we've got four
[1553.04 - 1558.08] chickens down here and we're smoking
[1555.44 - 1560.06] this stuff and we got the oak we're
[1558.08 - 1563.12] doing the oak logs that's what we do in
[1560.06 - 1565.66] our our you know bar at our Grill at our
[1563.12 - 1565.66] barbecue
[1565.94 - 1573.38] and that smoke enters into every pore
[1569.48 - 1576.08] and every single cell in that Pig's body
[1573.38 - 1578.48] and in that brisket
[1576.08 - 1581.30] in that cow's body
[1578.48 - 1583.46] and in those chickens body it enters in
[1581.30 - 1586.58] it goes Cuts right through it like no
[1583.46 - 1588.68] tomorrow that's what it does
[1586.58 - 1590.90] and when we get it on our skin it cuts
[1588.68 - 1592.82] through in in us and we get it in our
[1590.90 - 1594.56] lungs it cuts through in US
[1592.82 - 1596.78] it's like we're feet where it's like
[1594.56 - 1599.66] we're smoked pigs you know ready for a
[1596.78 - 1601.94] barbecue and
[1599.66 - 1604.04] then our immune system has to gobble up
[1601.94 - 1607.46] every single bit of it every little
[1604.04 - 1609.26] particle it can possibly gobble up every
[1607.46 - 1611.12] toxin it can gobble up and that's what
[1609.26 - 1613.76] happens is our immune system has to
[1611.12 - 1616.28] clean up the mess and then our immune
[1613.76 - 1618.08] cells get filled up
[1616.28 - 1620.36] and they die
[1618.08 - 1624.56] it's not like
[1620.36 - 1627.26] they can restore their
[1624.56 - 1630.14] their actually ending their life cycle
[1627.26 - 1633.62] because of this stuff
[1630.14 - 1636.74] so when we get exposure our immune cells
[1633.62 - 1640.04] have to eat it all up
[1636.74 - 1641.36] and then our immune cells are spent
[1640.04 - 1643.76] they're spent it's not like they
[1641.36 - 1645.38] recharge many of them eat all that
[1643.76 - 1647.42] garbage up
[1645.38 - 1649.10] and they die with that stuff
[1647.42 - 1652.58] and you can see it and then it leaves
[1649.10 - 1655.28] your body inside those dead immune cells
[1652.58 - 1656.36] which is really interesting
[1655.28 - 1659.18] so
[1656.36 - 1660.74] but then we're lowered immune system two
[1659.18 - 1662.30] reasons why we have the lowered immune
[1660.74 - 1664.46] system one is because our immune system
[1662.30 - 1666.56] is working so hard eating all the junk
[1664.46 - 1668.30] and garbage that we're breathing in or
[1666.56 - 1669.92] getting exposed to
[1668.30 - 1671.24] and the other
[1669.92 - 1673.70] is
[1671.24 - 1676.64] because it's just in the end takes time
[1673.70 - 1678.80] to restore immune cells we stay low for
[1676.64 - 1681.38] a while when that happens so when we're
[1678.80 - 1683.30] exposed to something it could be a week
[1681.38 - 1684.92] later two weeks later and we start
[1683.30 - 1686.84] getting symptoms and then we're like
[1684.92 - 1689.00] wondering why are we getting symptoms
[1686.84 - 1691.64] like why am I getting symptoms what did
[1689.00 - 1693.80] I do to two weeks ago what happened or
[1691.64 - 1695.48] what did I do today is what it is so
[1693.80 - 1697.46] people are like what did I do today what
[1695.48 - 1699.20] did I do wrong
[1697.46 - 1701.00] how come I'm kicked back a couple of
[1699.20 - 1703.58] steps how come I don't feel good how
[1701.00 - 1705.86] come I feel like I'm three steps back
[1703.58 - 1708.02] four steps back what am I doing wrong
[1705.86 - 1709.40] right now oh I had a celery juice this
[1708.02 - 1711.68] morning maybe it was the celery juice
[1709.40 - 1714.02] that did it no it was the fire and the
[1711.68 - 1716.06] smoke and the stuff from a month ago
[1714.02 - 1719.12] from three weeks ago it was an emotional
[1716.06 - 1720.80] experience from a month ago it was from
[1719.12 - 1722.48] that breakup from a month ago let's hit
[1720.80 - 1723.56] other different let's triggers let's hit
[1722.48 - 1725.68] a lot of different triggers let's go
[1723.56 - 1725.68] there
[1728.78 - 1733.88] here's some common triggers right here
[1730.82 - 1735.98] lowers the immune system greatly mold is
[1733.88 - 1738.50] one right there all on its own
[1735.98 - 1740.42] you're exposed to mold extensive blood
[1738.50 - 1742.82] draw I talk about that all the time you
[1740.42 - 1745.22] guys right you have a blood test a month
[1742.82 - 1748.28] ago and you're and you're literally
[1745.22 - 1749.84] feeling that effect a month later talk
[1748.28 - 1751.04] about that I'm not against blood tests
[1749.84 - 1752.66] you guys know the whole blood draw
[1751.04 - 1753.74] information for medical medium it's
[1752.66 - 1756.74] really
[1753.74 - 1756.74] comprehensive
[1758.06 - 1763.22] hey W how important are supplements
[1760.52 - 1765.26] while healing
[1763.22 - 1767.84] well
[1765.26 - 1771.32] let's cover that a little bit
[1767.84 - 1774.08] I take supplements I'm under stress
[1771.32 - 1776.60] I burn the Midnight Oil I've burned the
[1774.08 - 1777.44] candle at both ends I mean that's what I
[1776.60 - 1780.98] do
[1777.44 - 1783.02] so I use supplements for sure if I was
[1780.98 - 1785.00] somebody that was sick
[1783.02 - 1786.44] if I had symptoms I would use
[1785.00 - 1788.72] supplements
[1786.44 - 1791.42] if somebody in my family was sick I
[1788.72 - 1792.56] would have them doing supplements but it
[1791.42 - 1794.60] depends on what supplements you're
[1792.56 - 1796.82] talking about because there's a lot of
[1794.60 - 1799.58] supplements out there that are not a
[1796.82 - 1801.14] great thing not helpful they have all
[1799.58 - 1802.82] those natural flavors in it all that
[1801.14 - 1804.68] citric acid in it all the junk and
[1802.82 - 1807.02] garbage into really low quality if
[1804.68 - 1808.76] that's the case I mean I'm not thrilled
[1807.02 - 1810.80] about taking stuff like that I don't
[1808.76 - 1812.78] take stuff like that I'm very fortunate
[1810.80 - 1814.70] lucky that there's a company out there
[1812.78 - 1817.52] that puts the greatest stuff I've ever
[1814.70 - 1820.16] seen out there for for people
[1817.52 - 1822.44] but overall
[1820.16 - 1823.94] if your suffering is struggling you've
[1822.44 - 1825.86] got chronic fatigue syndrome you've got
[1823.94 - 1827.42] aches and pains you've got brain fog you
[1825.86 - 1830.00] got dizziness you've got ringing in the
[1827.42 - 1831.68] ear you've got tinnitus you got vertigo
[1830.00 - 1832.64] you got skin problems and everything
[1831.68 - 1835.46] else
[1832.64 - 1837.80] supplements are critical they are
[1835.46 - 1840.62] and it all depends like when I say that
[1837.80 - 1842.72] I'm not saying that just like hey you
[1840.62 - 1844.70] know one size fits all out there just go
[1842.72 - 1846.32] find supplements in the world I'm
[1844.70 - 1847.88] talking about medical medium protocols
[1846.32 - 1850.22] ask your doctor if the right for human
[1847.88 - 1852.74] medical needing Protocols are critical
[1850.22 - 1855.50] for people who are sick and struggling
[1852.74 - 1857.24] for many years and that's why people use
[1855.50 - 1858.68] medical meeting information they tried
[1857.24 - 1860.12] everything they did that they tried
[1858.68 - 1862.64] supplements out there they've tried
[1860.12 - 1865.40] diets out there they've tried everything
[1862.64 - 1867.68] and they still were sick so it's not
[1865.40 - 1869.60] just about the loose term supplements
[1867.68 - 1871.58] it's about the right tools The Details
[1869.60 - 1873.08] Matter and that's critical supplements
[1871.58 - 1875.18] that don't have alcohol in them
[1873.08 - 1877.58] supplements that aren't toxic
[1875.18 - 1879.38] supplements that aren't hiding
[1877.58 - 1882.32] ingredients in them that you shouldn't
[1879.38 - 1885.62] be consuming all of that matter so it's
[1882.32 - 1888.08] a question that takes a lot of
[1885.62 - 1889.10] information a lot of details to answer
[1888.08 - 1890.84] it
[1889.10 - 1892.64] but straightforward
[1890.84 - 1894.80] if you're somebody who's really sick
[1892.64 - 1897.32] you've been through hell and back
[1894.80 - 1900.02] it's good to know where to start maybe
[1897.32 - 1902.42] one or two supplements maybe something
[1900.02 - 1903.98] that can be really helpful
[1902.42 - 1906.86] and so yeah
[1903.98 - 1909.92] The Details Matter David
[1906.86 - 1912.76] so let's move through here a little bit
[1909.92 - 1912.76] celery juice
[1912.80 - 1916.30] that's a detail that matters
[1916.40 - 1920.78] um something you know about celery juice
[1918.20 - 1923.30] if you mix it with stuff if you're
[1920.78 - 1925.10] putting lemon in it you're killing a
[1923.30 - 1927.02] part of its power if you're adding water
[1925.10 - 1928.88] to it ice you're killing a part of its
[1927.02 - 1930.38] power don't add things to your celery
[1928.88 - 1934.48] juice
[1930.38 - 1938.54] celery juice is anti-viral antibacterial
[1934.48 - 1941.84] restores your HCL makes your HCL Rock
[1938.54 - 1944.60] Solid over time so you can digest those
[1941.84 - 1947.00] proteins break them down kill off
[1944.60 - 1949.34] pathogens that's mm info about HCL
[1947.00 - 1951.68] killing off pathogens and bacteria and
[1949.34 - 1954.86] all of that and
[1951.68 - 1957.40] so celery juice if it's used right can
[1954.86 - 1959.72] be so helpful for people
[1957.40 - 1961.52] there's people out there that only do
[1959.72 - 1963.38] celery juice and that's it they do that
[1961.52 - 1966.16] one medical medium tool and it's

[2019.24 - 2022.48] are breathing in poor air quality first
[2020.98 - 2024.40] of all all of us on the planet breathe
[2022.48 - 2028.18] in poor air quality
[2024.40 - 2029.38] all of us I don't care where you are on
[2028.18 - 2031.90] this planet
[2029.38 - 2034.96] the air is circulating
[2031.90 - 2037.90] you're not somewhere where the air
[2034.96 - 2039.28] hasn't been somewhere else there's no
[2037.90 - 2042.46] such thing
[2039.28 - 2044.62] you're not in a dome or a bubble
[2042.46 - 2047.44] somewhere where the only area breathing
[2044.62 - 2049.48] is in that Dome or bubble
[2047.44 - 2053.26] wherever you are on this planet you can
[2049.48 - 2056.86] be on a crisp clean fresh Mountain Top
[2053.26 - 2059.92] far away from civilization and you can

[2059.92 - 2065.28] Trail and dust and garbage and junk and
[2063.76 - 2068.50] everything else
[2065.28 - 2071.08] easily and not realize it sure it's not
[2068.50 - 2072.52] maybe cleaner than being up against that
[2071.08 - 2074.86] junk in those pollutants and everything
[2072.52 - 2078.58] but still there's nowhere on the planet
[2074.86 - 2080.80] right now where you're you are free
[2078.58 - 2083.02] from breathing in toxins poor air
[2080.80 - 2085.18] quality everywhere on planet Earth I'm
[2083.02 - 2086.26] so sorry that I deliver bad news about
[2085.18 - 2088.30] that
[2086.26 - 2089.44] I can't help it I'm not gonna lie to you
[2088.30 - 2092.14] and be like oh

[2104.62 - 2110.44] heavy metal detox smoothie why heavy
[2108.16 - 2113.98] metal detox movie because of the heavy
[2110.44 - 2117.28] metals that are in the air sea trails
[2113.98 - 2121.36] traveling pesticides DBT
[2117.28 - 2124.30] right DBT also poor air quality from
[2121.36 - 2127.90] fires remember the two bunny rabbits
[2124.30 - 2131.38] that Lit the fire because they were cold
[2127.90 - 2135.24] actually the real story is a deer was
[2131.38 - 2135.24] playing with a pack of matches
[2135.34 - 2139.30] so the deer had little deer hoofs and
[2137.86 - 2141.58] was trying to
[2139.30 - 2144.54] actually strike a match found a pack of
[2141.58 - 2144.54] matches in the woods
[2144.64 - 2150.52] you know and then it went up okay
[2147.76 - 2152.26] extractor smoothie so back to the heavy
[2150.52 - 2154.42] metal smoothie sorry about this it's
[2152.26 - 2157.24] there to bring heavy metals out of the
[2154.42 - 2161.02] body and other pollutants and toxins out
[2157.24 - 2163.96] of the body so the scale gets tipped the
[2161.02 - 2166.24] more goes in and doesn't leave us the

[2175.18 - 2182.02] visiting doctors visiting therapists
[2178.68 - 2183.46] visiting psychiatrists because no one

[2315.16 - 2318.40] so
[2316.36 - 2320.74] keep that in mind when you get a chance
[2318.40 - 2322.00] it's a great tool has so many great
[2320.74 - 2323.80] Tools in it
[2322.00 - 2325.54] it's really incredible
[2323.80 - 2327.58] so I want to make sure you guys have
[2325.54 - 2329.56] these options empowerment is about
[2327.58 - 2331.60] having information
[2329.56 - 2334.78] and information that can help you heal
[2331.60 - 2336.88] strengthen you help power you through
[2334.78 - 2339.52] so it's not about fear or anything like
[2336.88 - 2341.50] that we don't want to walk into
[2339.52 - 2344.44] a storm
[2341.50 - 2347.62] because we just don't fear it it's not
[2344.44 - 2349.84] that if we have to walk into a storm we
[2347.62 - 2352.78] want to know what we can do to support
[2349.84 - 2354.52] our body and strengthen it as we're
[2352.78 - 2356.68] walking into a storm and that's
[2354.52 - 2358.72] important right there all of it
[2356.68 - 2362.08] so here's a question right now how long
[2358.72 - 2364.24] should we expect to feel detox symptoms
[2362.08 - 2365.86] so keep in mind with a lot of people
[2364.24 - 2369.16] okay
[2365.86 - 2371.02] everybody's different in so many ways
[2369.16 - 2373.42] somebody
[2371.02 - 2375.22] could think they're having a detox
[2373.42 - 2379.18] symptom
[2375.22 - 2382.12] but they're dealing with a symptom
[2379.18 - 2384.04] so that's important to know right there
[2382.12 - 2386.26] somebody could be thinking they're doing
[2384.04 - 2387.76] something that's making them detox but
[2386.26 - 2390.46] they're not doing something that's
[2387.76 - 2393.28] making them detox
[2390.46 - 2395.68] keep that in mind too I've seen people
[2393.28 - 2397.60] out there in the world right they've
[2395.68 - 2399.10] seen people on social media saying
[2397.60 - 2400.78] they're detoxing and then they talk
[2399.10 - 2402.70] about what they're eating and doing in
[2400.78 - 2405.22] them and looking at them like I don't
[2402.70 - 2406.78] think you're doing some detoxing with
[2405.22 - 2408.52] that right there
[2406.78 - 2410.20] they're eating cheese or whatever it is
[2408.52 - 2412.84] that they're eating
[2410.20 - 2414.88] so there's so much misinformation about
[2412.84 - 2417.16] detox I'm gonna do a podcast episode
[2414.88 - 2420.82] just letting you know it's a word that's
[2417.16 - 2423.64] way overused all the time by everybody
[2420.82 - 2425.62] okay and it's way overused by people
[2423.64 - 2428.14] outside of the medical medium
[2425.62 - 2429.94] information so a lot of people be like
[2428.14 - 2432.04] all medical medium does is talk about
[2429.94 - 2434.38] detox that's kind of strange because
[2432.04 - 2436.84] that's not what medical medium only
[2434.38 - 2438.76] talks about so that's kind of a term
[2436.84 - 2440.62] that's used out there in the world
[2438.76 - 2442.78] throughout the years when someone
[2440.62 - 2444.82] doesn't know why someone is sick and
[2442.78 - 2447.34] what's happening to them medical name
[2444.82 - 2448.30] info cleared the air with that by giving
[2447.34 - 2451.78] people
[2448.30 - 2453.58] their information that allowed them to
[2451.78 - 2455.38] find out why they were sick and why they
[2453.58 - 2457.02] were struggling what these symptoms were
[2455.38 - 2460.18] and what was happening with their health
[2457.02 - 2463.00] that information was critical for people
[2460.18 - 2465.58] to heal but detox is thrown into
[2463.00 - 2468.16] everything now out there it's also a
[2465.58 - 2469.90] term that's used to sell products now so
[2468.16 - 2471.64] all you're going to do is hear the word
[2469.90 - 2474.40] detox out there
[2471.64 - 2476.86] because detox they're just they're
[2474.40 - 2480.34] basically aligning detox with products
[2476.86 - 2481.90] so everybody you know becomes like a
[2480.34 - 2484.90] sales pitch out there with the detox
[2481.90 - 2488.26] word so keep that in mind too
[2484.90 - 2490.66] but a lot of people don't realize it if
[2488.26 - 2494.20] they have a flare up with something or
[2490.66 - 2497.02] they were sick with something anyway
[2494.20 - 2499.48] they don't realize what's detox or not
[2497.02 - 2502.78] that's important to know I'm going to go
[2499.48 - 2505.72] into deep Hill on the whole process
[2502.78 - 2507.76] about detox a lot of people blame real
[2505.72 - 2510.40] symptoms on detox
[2507.76 - 2512.62] which is wrong it's not detox it's a
[2510.40 - 2514.72] symptom that was already there
[2512.62 - 2517.12] that's critical to know too so I'm just
[2514.72 - 2518.68] giving you little tidbits about detox
[2517.12 - 2520.78] but I see it all the time on social
[2518.68 - 2523.06] media I see people saying they're
[2520.78 - 2525.70] detoxing and then you're seeing what
[2523.06 - 2528.16] they're eating and
[2525.70 - 2530.86] then you're like okay
[2528.16 - 2533.92] um with what you're eating I don't know
[2530.86 - 2537.22] what kind of real detox you're doing
[2533.92 - 2540.28] because it's impossible to detox when
[2537.22 - 2542.68] you're on nuts and seeds it's impossible
[2540.28 - 2545.80] to detox when you're on nut Butters it's
[2542.68 - 2548.32] impossible to detox when you're on olive
[2545.80 - 2550.48] oil I'm not saying anything these things
[2548.32 - 2553.00] are good or bad so don't don't get
[2550.48 - 2555.10] scared I'm not saying that also people
[2553.00 - 2557.68] blame detox when really they are
[2555.10 - 2560.50] emotional because they are not drowning
[2557.68 - 2563.02] their emotions out
[2560.50 - 2564.64] so a lot of people have emotions that
[2563.02 - 2566.56] are surfacing
[2564.64 - 2568.78] because they're not suppressing those
[2566.56 - 2571.30] emotions with food
[2568.78 - 2573.16] so it's it's a tricky situation we can
[2571.30 - 2575.02] get into when we're doing Comfort Foods
[2573.16 - 2576.82] including vegan Comfort Foods out there
[2575.02 - 2577.90] I've seen a lot of intense vegan Comfort
[2576.82 - 2581.26] Foods
[2577.90 - 2584.56] we can suppress our emotions with eating
[2581.26 - 2587.68] no judgment It's Hard Out Here on planet
[2584.56 - 2591.04] Earth it's not an easy place to live
[2587.68 - 2592.96] and so we can easily suppress our
[2591.04 - 2595.54] emotions with food
[2592.96 - 2597.64] and that happens a lot with so many
[2595.54 - 2600.16] people so once you're taking some of
[2597.64 - 2602.20] those Foods away the emotions are just
[2600.16 - 2604.42] gonna pour out
[2602.20 - 2607.06] and it's like as they're starting to
[2604.42 - 2609.40] surface and pour out it's like we've got
[2607.06 - 2612.04] to get that food in us we gotta get that
[2609.40 - 2614.08] emotional food to suppress it that
[2612.04 - 2616.14] comfort food to suppress it
[2614.08 - 2619.12] program
[2616.14 - 2620.86] understandably so and rightfully so
[2619.12 - 2623.50] a lot of people have it really hard they
[2620.86 - 2626.80] lean on food completely understand I've
[2623.50 - 2629.92] seen this out there it's a normal human
[2626.80 - 2631.24] experience and a difficult one for so
[2629.92 - 2632.98] many people
[2631.24 - 2637.42] but
[2632.98 - 2639.76] that alone can create an emotional detox
[2637.42 - 2643.24] and that's really intense all on its own
[2639.76 - 2645.88] so detoxing is you can't patch it all in
[2643.24 - 2648.94] one word like it's detox it's detox it's
[2645.88 - 2651.82] detox there's a lot of there's a lot of
[2648.94 - 2653.14] people in health that don't know what's
[2651.82 - 2655.48] happening with there's a lot of people
[2653.14 - 2657.16] that work in the health space they have
[2655.48 - 2658.90] clients
[2657.16 - 2662.02] and there's a lot of health coaches that
[2658.90 - 2664.42] have clients and they don't know why no
[2662.02 - 2668.26] disrespect but they don't know why
[2664.42 - 2670.90] their client is having a symptom or
[2668.26 - 2674.14] their client is having something happen
[2670.90 - 2675.46] and so it's so easy just to say you're
[2674.14 - 2677.62] detoxing
[2675.46 - 2679.12] that's what it is you're detoxing that's
[2677.62 - 2680.26] what it is
[2679.12 - 2682.48] so
[2680.26 - 2685.18] it's kind of easy to do that
[2682.48 - 2689.40] I'm not and I'm not judging any health
[2685.18 - 2689.40] coach or anybody around that
[2689.86 - 2693.28] it's not what I'm doing I'm just saying
[2691.78 - 2695.02] it's an easy word
[2693.28 - 2696.94] to throw around
[2695.02 - 2700.30] and toss about
[2696.94 - 2702.82] one that's tossed about way too much in
[2700.30 - 2705.82] too many ways too many
[2702.82 - 2708.46] too many times so
[2705.82 - 2711.82] so is detoxification
[2708.46 - 2713.56] you know a real thing yes it is
[2711.82 - 2717.30] but it's such
[2713.56 - 2720.28] a mixed bag of nuts and there are people
[2717.30 - 2722.14] who don't know
[2720.28 - 2723.22] what's happening with their body or
[2722.14 - 2724.90] inside their body because they haven't
[2723.22 - 2727.18] been taught why they're sick and what
[2724.90 - 2728.68] their symptoms are and so they'll come
[2727.18 - 2734.26] across somebody that just tells them
[2728.68 - 2736.30] they're detoxing and it's like uh no
[2734.26 - 2738.94] I've seen this with friends I've seen
[2736.30 - 2742.42] this people I've known out there
[2738.94 - 2745.24] they did not know why they were sick and
[2742.42 - 2746.68] somebody told them it's detox it's like
[2745.24 - 2747.46] uh no
[2746.68 - 2750.40] um
[2747.46 - 2752.86] she's dealing with a viral infection
[2750.40 - 2754.60] so there's so many different levels of
[2752.86 - 2757.06] how it works so I'm just giving you a
[2754.60 - 2759.76] couple of tidbits but honestly it's it
[2757.06 - 2762.58] takes a podcast episode and we're just
[2759.76 - 2766.06] gonna have to jam pack that episode like
[2762.58 - 2768.52] to the Tilt because there's so many
[2766.06 - 2770.62] details around detox you're critical to
[2768.52 - 2773.14] know and critical to understand
[2770.62 - 2776.86] basically it's overused
[2773.14 - 2779.62] most of the time it's used for the wrong
[2776.86 - 2782.74] reasons most of the time it's just a
[2779.62 - 2786.10] word to paper over and blanket
[2782.74 - 2788.44] something someone doesn't understand
[2786.10 - 2793.24] and we have to be careful with that word
[2788.44 - 2795.28] detox and it's being used with selling
[2793.24 - 2797.62] products right now big time skin
[2795.28 - 2800.68] products facial products internal
[2797.62 - 2802.66] products body products
[2800.68 - 2805.78] hair products
[2802.66 - 2807.00] it's just a great term being thrown out
[2805.78 - 2810.10] it's being
[2807.00 - 2812.98] weaponized so it's another thing too is
[2810.10 - 2815.32] the word detox was being weaponized
[2812.98 - 2818.02] against kind of infiltrated into the
[2815.32 - 2819.94] medical meeting community
[2818.02 - 2821.74] it's not that I ever said detox isn't
[2819.94 - 2823.60] real or I never talked about detox
[2821.74 - 2825.76] before that's not true but it filtered
[2823.60 - 2827.86] into the medical mean community and
[2825.76 - 2831.22] became like a weapon
[2827.86 - 2833.68] and has confused a lot of people
[2831.22 - 2835.90] and so that's something that happens too
[2833.68 - 2840.28] A lot of times somebody might go through
[2835.90 - 2842.92] a serious emotional experience
[2840.28 - 2844.78] it lowered their immune system
[2842.92 - 2848.44] they had a flare-up
[2844.78 - 2850.54] and then someone said it's detox
[2848.44 - 2852.52] that's really common
[2850.54 - 2854.98] but really you went through an emotional
[2852.52 - 2856.72] experience a month ago
[2854.98 - 2858.10] and that emotional experience lowered
[2856.72 - 2859.72] your immune system now it's time to
[2858.10 - 2861.16] actually build that immune system up and
[2859.72 - 2863.08] do the right things but someone will say
[2861.16 - 2864.64] no it's detox stop everything you're
[2863.08 - 2866.98] doing
[2864.64 - 2869.44] that's something I've seen a lot and
[2866.98 - 2872.14] it's saddening I've seen people move
[2869.44 - 2874.36] forward move forward and then they get
[2872.14 - 2876.10] exposure to something or an emotional
[2874.36 - 2878.92] experience and exposure to something
[2876.10 - 2881.02] your immune system drops
[2878.92 - 2882.70] they get a little bit of a flare up and
[2881.02 - 2884.62] then someone who thinks it knows
[2882.70 - 2886.66] everything they'll say oh it's detox
[2884.62 - 2887.92] stuff everything and now they're getting
[2886.66 - 2891.42] worse because they stopped everything
[2887.92 - 2891.42] that was healing them to begin with
[2891.82 - 2895.24] because a lot of times when you're going
[2893.44 - 2897.88] through something you drown your
[2895.24 - 2899.98] people are drowning their feelings and
[2897.88 - 2902.02] body with adrenaline and comfort foods
[2899.98 - 2904.78] to override it so when we're up against
[2902.02 - 2906.64] stress and emotional abuse and emotional
[2904.78 - 2909.34] struggles
[2906.64 - 2911.86] all of that we drown our bodies with
[2909.34 - 2914.86] either adrenaline or adrenaline and food
[2911.86 - 2916.30] and we're pumped up with this and we get
[2914.86 - 2919.84] really toxic
[2916.30 - 2922.02] from all of that and so
[2919.84 - 2925.30] a lot of people don't realize and so
[2922.02 - 2927.40] detoxing yeah it's a real thing but like
[2925.30 - 2928.54] I said it's overused
[2927.40 - 2930.76] you know
[2928.54 - 2932.98] and you could feel good doing it too you
[2930.76 - 2935.44] can you can feel like whoa
[2932.98 - 2938.38] um I'm eating all this food and I feel
[2935.44 - 2939.94] good and everything else and we're we're
[2938.38 - 2942.22] suppressing everything that we're
[2939.94 - 2944.26] drowning ourselves with adrenaline from
[2942.22 - 2947.08] the comfort food so I just wanna
[2944.26 - 2950.74] let me put a little Clarity on that too
[2947.08 - 2952.42] when you eat a food that you've reframed
[2950.74 - 2954.88] from for a while
[2952.42 - 2956.32] because you know the food that food is
[2954.88 - 2958.00] probably not helping you you know that
[2956.32 - 2960.34] food is probably not that great but you
[2958.00 - 2962.50] refrain from that food for a while and
[2960.34 - 2964.06] then you eat that food you get an
[2962.50 - 2967.66] adrenaline rush
[2964.06 - 2970.60] an adrenaline Surge and you get euphoric
[2967.66 - 2972.04] from having that food
[2970.60 - 2974.38] and so
[2972.04 - 2977.20] then you think whoa I just stopped my
[2974.38 - 2979.24] detox but really
[2977.20 - 2981.82] you just got jacked up on a tremendous
[2979.24 - 2983.26] amount of adrenaline
[2981.82 - 2985.24] happens all the time I've seen people
[2983.26 - 2986.74] with chocolate the war of chocolate they
[2985.24 - 2988.54] have like a war with themselves the
[2986.74 - 2990.22] chocolate they have a chocolate drawer
[2988.54 - 2992.02] saying I like all their chocolate in
[2990.22 - 2993.58] here and they know not to have too much
[2992.02 - 2995.38] of it because they know they can get so
[2993.58 - 2996.64] jacked up from it but they stay away
[2995.38 - 2997.84] from that chocolate for a little while
[2996.64 - 3000.38] and then they go and they have that
[2997.84 - 3000.38] piece of chocolate
[3000.48 - 3004.26] they get euphoric and adrenaline floods
[3002.58 - 3007.08] them and they're like whoa I just broke
[3004.26 - 3010.08] a detox no you didn't break a detox
[3007.08 - 3013.14] you're saturated with adrenaline the
[3010.08 - 3015.66] cocoa butter the cacao butter any kind
[3013.14 - 3017.40] of fat can also saturate our bodies with
[3015.66 - 3021.24] adrenaline too that's another thing that
[3017.40 - 3024.18] happens chocolate will surge adrenaline
[3021.24 - 3026.76] and that gives you the feeling the
[3024.18 - 3028.68] euphoric a feeling right between the
[3026.76 - 3031.32] caffeine and the adrenaline both
[3028.68 - 3032.04] combined and you feel high and you're
[3031.32 - 3034.26] like
[3032.04 - 3037.08] I don't know why you know that feels so
[3034.26 - 3039.06] good I slowed down my detox I stopped my
[3037.08 - 3040.80] detox
[3039.06 - 3042.78] and then there's chemicals in food and
[3040.80 - 3045.18] natural flavors and food the MSG gives
[3042.78 - 3047.22] us a feeling too of like a euphoric
[3045.18 - 3049.02] addictive feeling that ends up surging
[3047.22 - 3050.58] or adrenaline too so when we stay away
[3049.02 - 3052.56] from those Foods
[3050.58 - 3054.78] we're really feeling
[3052.56 - 3056.88] how sick we really are and then when you
[3054.78 - 3058.38] bring some of these Foods back in you're
[3056.88 - 3060.12] like you get high for a moment you're
[3058.38 - 3061.98] like wait a minute I've seen people go
[3060.12 - 3064.20] on a massive
[3061.98 - 3066.54] a massive Indulgence
[3064.20 - 3068.76] where they're just they're just like oh
[3066.54 - 3072.30] my God I could eat everything I want now
[3068.76 - 3075.36] and I feel good but what you don't see a
[3072.30 - 3077.58] month later is they won't post on social
[3075.36 - 3080.22] media that they have tanked and they are
[3077.58 - 3082.02] feeling crappy again and their food took
[3080.22 - 3083.88] them down
[3082.02 - 3086.76] you won't see that
[3083.88 - 3088.56] coffee and matcha tea same thing a lot
[3086.76 - 3090.90] of times you'll see people where they're
[3088.56 - 3092.34] actually staying they're they're keeping
[3090.90 - 3094.44] to something they're keeping to a
[3092.34 - 3096.12] routine they're actually eating good
[3094.44 - 3098.88] they're keeping something maybe they're
[3096.12 - 3100.44] doing a medical medium 369 for a while
[3098.88 - 3102.12] maybe they're taking care of themselves
[3100.44 - 3103.86] and they're keeping out the garbage in
[3102.12 - 3105.54] the junk right they're keeping out the
[3103.86 - 3107.22] trigger foods they're keeping out the
[3105.54 - 3108.60] the brain rotting Foods the
[3107.22 - 3111.78] troublemakers and they're keeping all
[3108.60 - 3114.42] that out and then
[3111.78 - 3115.92] they start eating something they're back
[3114.42 - 3117.18] to eating a lot of cacao and they're
[3115.92 - 3118.68] back to eating something else they're
[3117.18 - 3120.60] back to eating pizza whatever it is and
[3118.68 - 3122.52] they feel you bork and high and they're
[3120.60 - 3124.98] on adrenaline and they feel amazing and
[3122.52 - 3126.48] they feel so good and they're like I
[3124.98 - 3128.82] should have been eating anything I ever
[3126.48 - 3130.50] wanted this is all I needed to do was
[3128.82 - 3132.66] just eat what I wanted and all my
[3130.50 - 3134.70] problems would be fine I don't know what
[3132.66 - 3138.30] I was doing I was detoxing all that time
[3134.70 - 3140.46] always detoxing I'm sick of detoxing and
[3138.30 - 3142.74] now I'm eating so good I'm eating sorry
[3140.46 - 3144.78] eating anything I want
[3142.74 - 3146.40] that medical medium was wrong or that
[3144.78 - 3150.06] medical medium person was wrong whatever
[3146.40 - 3152.40] it is and then like they're shooting out
[3150.06 - 3154.20] their posts like I feel good I just
[3152.40 - 3156.06] needed to do this I just needed this
[3154.20 - 3158.46] meditation and I could eat whatever I
[3156.06 - 3161.28] wanted I can just I just need this neuro
[3158.46 - 3162.84] realignment tool and I could just eat
[3161.28 - 3165.18] what I want
[3162.84 - 3166.80] and then what you don't see after you
[3165.18 - 3168.96] see all those posts you don't see a
[3166.80 - 3173.58] couple months later someone who's back
[3168.96 - 3175.20] on all of the medical medium stuff a
[3173.58 - 3177.42] morning cleanses the mono cleanses the
[3175.20 - 3179.04] heavy metal detox smoothies the 369s
[3177.42 - 3180.36] they're back on their celery juice
[3179.04 - 3181.26] they're back on all that but they're not
[3180.36 - 3182.46] going to go and correct everything
[3181.26 - 3183.78] because they're going to look like a
[3183.78 - 3188.22] so they're not going to go and and bite
[3186.00 - 3191.28] the bullet and go into a post saying you
[3188.22 - 3194.28] know what I actually had it wrong and
[3191.28 - 3196.02] now I'm back on MM stuff no one corrects
[3194.28 - 3197.34] it they never do it they just you never
[3196.02 - 3199.02] know what happens to them two months
[3197.34 - 3201.18] later
[3199.02 - 3203.28] and many people heal and then they go
[3201.18 - 3205.08] eat what they want and they get high on
[3203.28 - 3206.88] it
[3205.08 - 3209.10] and when you get high on it you think
[3206.88 - 3211.02] you're just like whoa
[3209.10 - 3213.42] and they end up just on what
[3211.02 - 3216.36] what they what got them better

[3409.38 - 3417.54] is all our machine can handle technology
[3413.48 - 3420.42] whatever can handle and we had to shut
[3417.54 - 3422.04] down the sign ups after one hour less
[3420.42 - 3423.66] than one hour
[3422.04 - 3425.64] um and we had twenty thousand signed

[3436.56 - 3440.88] up The Floodgate for the light Blast for
[3438.78 - 3443.16] multiple hours and we'll probably get 60
[3440.88 - 3445.38] or 80 000 people and so forth and that's
[3443.16 - 3447.72] what we want to be able to have the
