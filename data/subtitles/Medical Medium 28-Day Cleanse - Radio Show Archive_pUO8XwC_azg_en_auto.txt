[546.20 - 552.48] you'll notice that you can go back to
[549.72 - 554.84] healthier other healthy diets as long as
[552.48 - 557.12] it's not you going back to you know
[554.84 - 559.64] jumping into the bad foods jumping into
[557.12 - 562.36] all the pork and jumping into you know
[559.64 - 564.64] all the corn syrup and jumping into um
[562.36 - 567.72] you know all the dairy products and and
[564.64 - 570.36] all the milkshakes and you know whatever
[567.72 - 571.40] and all the bacon and said pork right
[570.36 - 573.60] and you know as long as you're not
[571.40 - 575.72] jumping into all the fried food and all
[573.60 - 576.84] the fast food and all the processed food
[575.72 - 579.36] and all these other different things as
[576.84 - 581.00] long you're not jumping into all of that
[579.36 - 582.92] and that's the key to understand like
[581.00 - 585.48] that's a thing to focus on but if you're
[582.92 - 587.88] jumping into some paleo healthy
[585.48 - 589.80] conscious diet you're jumping into some
[587.88 - 591.68] healthy conscious vegetarian diet you're
[589.80 - 594.64] jumping into some other high protein
[591.68 - 596.92] conscious diet or whatever it is or even
[594.64 - 599.96] some you know uh even if you're jumping
[596.92 - 602.32] into a cooked vegan diet you always have
[599.96 - 605.88] the option to go back to the 28 day
[602.32 - 607.36] cleanse for a reboot to get rebooted
[605.88 - 610.52] you're going go back to the medical
[607.36 - 613.48] medium 28d cleanse to get Juiced back up
[610.52 - 615.60] again and and that's the key and listen
[613.48 - 617.64] everybody's different everybody has a
[615.60 - 620.52] different issue going on different like
[617.64 - 622.08] toxic load somebody else might have more
[620.52 - 623.28] petrochemicals because they had gas
[622.08 - 625.04] spilled on their hands when they're
[623.28 - 626.28] mowing the lawn 10 years ago somebody
[625.04 - 628.32] else might have something else in their
[626.28 - 630.16] liver inside their body somebody may
[628.32 - 632.32] have more pharmace euticals inside their
[630.16 - 634.24] body from taking a lot of
[632.32 - 636.36] pharmaceuticals to you know and that
[634.24 - 637.64] happens too and so there's some people
[636.36 - 639.04] that have a lot of anti-depressants
[637.64 - 641.40] sitting in their liver and other parts
[639.04 - 643.12] of the body some people have um a lot of
[641.40 - 644.32] antibiotics they took them for years
[643.12 - 646.16] that's sitting in there so you got to
[644.32 - 648.12] always keep in mind that everybody's
[646.16 - 650.20] different and you don't always get the
[648.12 - 652.64] same results instantly you're never
[650.20 - 654.76] supposed to get Clockwork Clockwork
[652.64 - 657.32] results in a cleanse than somebody else
[654.76 - 658.80] does how can you because everything is
[657.32 - 660.24] different the toxic load is different
[658.80 - 662.64] the organs are different in different
[660.24 - 664.72] ways somebody else may have some kind of
[662.64 - 667.00] high viral load somebody else may have a
[664.72 - 668.84] real low viral load somebody somebody be
[667.00 - 671.28] may be filled with a lot of bacteria
[668.84 - 674.52] some people may not all these things
[671.28 - 677.48] matter some people might have really
[674.52 - 678.96] really low hydrochloric acid in their
[677.48 - 681.48] intestinal tread in their in their
[678.96 - 684.36] stomach and their dadum some people may
[681.48 - 687.40] have really really low bile bile
[684.36 - 690.00] production in the liver and so
[687.40 - 692.88] everything play but the but the whole
[690.00 - 694.36] point is everybody's going to be getting
[692.88 - 695.88] something done in their body that's
[694.36 - 697.56] going to be moving them forward that's
[695.88 - 699.36] the whole reboot that's the whole thing
[697.56 - 701.80] that's the power of it that's the magic

[869.72 - 874.32] person is different but it's going to
[872.12 - 877.24] help that's the point I've seen
[874.32 - 879.84] miraculous benefits miraculous
[877.24 - 882.84] unbelievable benefits but guess
[879.84 - 884.84] what I'm not even just talking about the
[882.84 - 887.32] benefits I'm seeing from when medical
[884.84 - 891.92] medium the first book came
[887.32 - 894.16] out I actually I actually am talking
[891.92 - 897.40] about the years and the years and and
[894.16 - 899.32] the years and the years of working on
[897.40 - 901.32] people day in and day out day in and day
[899.32 - 902.84] out day in and day out like total like
[901.32 - 903.84] decades and decades and Decades of
[902.84 - 906.20] helping
[903.84 - 909.36] people and making sure they're getting
[906.20 - 913.00] to where they go and I've seen people
[909.36 - 917.80] who walked into my office okay with
[913.00 - 920.32] walking sticks and braces on their legs
[917.80 - 923.08] walking sticks braces on their legs or
[920.32 - 925.04] being wheeled into my office I've even
[923.08 - 929.28] seen situations where I've seen people
[925.04 - 931.60] carried into my office over the decades
[929.28 - 933.72] and uh and and I'm telling you the power
[931.60 - 935.16] is unbelievable about what can happen
[933.72 - 936.80] when you get fruits and vegetables and
[935.16 - 940.56] the right kinds of fruits and vegetables
[936.80 - 943.80] in your diet the power the power is is
[940.56 - 945.80] is is you know just amazing it is and
[943.80 - 948.32] that's what I'm talking about and that's
[945.80 - 951.20] what matters that's what
[948.32 - 953.36] matters and so you take it one day at a
[951.20 - 954.76] time it's not to be scary it's not to be
[953.36 - 956.24] like frightening when you hear about a
[954.76 - 959.20] cleanse when you hear about what can I
[956.24 - 961.96] do to change my diet you know that's
[959.20 - 963.72] that's it's more than that it's better
[961.96 - 965.84] than that it's better than any of that
[963.72 - 968.64] there's nothing scary about it if you
[965.84 - 972.60] can only do it for one week then you do
[968.64 - 974.36] it for one week if that's all you can do
[972.60 - 976.12] and you do it one week at a time then
[974.36 - 978.36] hey I'm doing the 28 day cleanse I'm
[976.12 - 980.32] doing it 7 days because you know what's
[978.36 - 982.40] going to happen you're going to end up
[980.32 - 985.24] doing it two weeks someday you might
[982.40 - 989.56] even end up doing two weeks after your
[985.24 - 990.92] one week so you go so you go two weeks
[989.56 - 994.72] two
[990.92 - 996.44] weeks and um and that matters and you
[994.72 - 999.60] might even go three weeks you might even
[996.44 - 1001.12] go four weeks so think about that and
[999.60 - 1003.04] that's what used to happen I remember
[1001.12 - 1004.68] years and years and years ago and over
[1003.04 - 1007.08] the years I remember people coming into
[1004.68 - 1010.40] the office and I've watched what the
[1007.08 - 1013.16] 28-day cleanse watch what the 28 day
[1010.40 - 1015.36] cleanse has done for them I have watched
[1013.16 - 1016.80] it and I've seen things you wouldn't
[1015.36 - 1018.48] even believe that people are
[1016.80 - 1020.84] experiencing now all over the world
[1018.48 - 1023.24] world but I've seen things you wouldn't
[1020.84 - 1026.12] even believe and that's what I'm talking
[1023.24 - 1028.12] about quite quite an amazing amazing
[1026.12 - 1029.68] amazing story that goes on out there
[1028.12 - 1031.48] with people's healing in their body and
[1029.68 - 1033.40] what they can do had people that have
[1031.48 - 1035.24] done the 28 day cleanse for 6 months in
[1033.40 - 1037.04] a row got them out of wheelchairs got
[1035.24 - 1039.64] them out of multiple sceris got them out
[1037.04 - 1041.60] of ALS I've seen people do the 28 day
[1039.64 - 1043.32] cleanse for 3 months got them out of the
[1041.60 - 1044.92] worst cases of Xmen psoriasis where
[1043.32 - 1047.84] their body was just riddled with Xmen
[1044.92 - 1049.16] psoriasis I mean yeah I've seen the 28
[1047.84 - 1050.76] day cleanse
[1049.16 - 1052.40] turn people's neurological systems
[1050.76 - 1054.00] around so they could start talking again
[1052.40 - 1055.40] functioning again getting out of bed
[1054.00 - 1059.00] dropping the fatigue I've seen the
[1055.40 - 1061.52] 28-day cleanse turn lives around like no
[1059.00 - 1063.08] other over the years and the decades
[1061.52 - 1065.24] I've seen people walking in with the
[1063.08 - 1067.80] worst cases of neurological lime
[1065.24 - 1070.16] starting their 28 day cleanse at home
[1067.80 - 1071.76] doing it for a year and then getting
[1070.16 - 1075.28] stronger than they ever have there's
[1071.76 - 1078.72] people now that are 75 80 85 years old
[1075.28 - 1080.44] that healed 30 25 30 years ago go from
[1078.72 - 1083.48] doing the 28 day cleanse and they they
[1080.44 - 1085.84] they never turned back they never turned
[1083.48 - 1087.84] back and I'm saying that that's the
[1085.84 - 1090.40] power of the body that's the power of
[1087.84 - 1092.96] the body and what the body can do it's
[1090.40 - 1094.60] quite extraordinary and quite unique
[1092.96 - 1097.80] everybody's unique their body's unique
[1094.60 - 1101.08] their immune system is unique but what
[1097.80 - 1102.60] transpires is just unbelievable and you
[1101.08 - 1103.76] have to know that when you're putting in
[1102.60 - 1105.20] the fruits and vegetables when you're
[1103.76 - 1107.36] putting in the time and energy when
[1105.20 - 1109.76] you're putting in the dedication what
[1107.36 - 1111.32] can happen you have to always keep in
[1109.76 - 1114.60] mind you're doing something good for
[1111.32 - 1118.68] yourself and how that matters and what

[1156.32 - 1159.32] fish and seafood if you're doing fish
[1157.84 - 1161.04] and seafood you might be totally in it
[1159.32 - 1164.52] we're going to take out that this is not
[1161.04 - 1167.08] scary the 28 day cleanse is fruits and
[1164.52 - 1169.92] vegetables in their raw form and that
[1167.08 - 1172.44] might be that might be spooky for some
[1169.92 - 1175.60] people that might be spooky fruits and
[1172.44 - 1179.00] vegetables in the raw form might be
[1175.60 - 1181.20] actually terrifying for some it's not
[1179.00 - 1184.32] it's not a terrifying thing that's why
[1181.20 - 1186.08] you can do the 28 day cleanse for 7 Days
[1184.32 - 1187.24] Raw fruits and vegetables for 7 days and
[1186.08 - 1188.20] we're going to do it a certain way and
[1187.24 - 1189.76] we're going to talk about how we're
[1188.20 - 1192.92] going to do it in a certain
[1189.76 - 1194.04] way we really are we really are and
[1192.92 - 1195.60] that's what's going to it's going to be
[1194.04 - 1197.56] really fun to get through this and
[1195.60 - 1198.56] that's why I say someone said to me and
[1197.56 - 1200.24] many people have said said over the
[1198.56 - 1202.52] years well can I do the 28 day cleanse
[1200.24 - 1203.72] for 7 days I said yeah you better
[1202.52 - 1205.72] believe it and you know what happened
[1203.72 - 1207.28] they ended up going 8 Days 9 days 10
[1205.72 - 1210.16] days because they're getting results 11
[1207.28 - 1211.56] Days 12 days 13 days 14 days 15 days
[1210.16 - 1213.04] next thing you know it they're in their
[1211.56 - 1215.00] third week next thing you know it you're
[1213.04 - 1217.88] in your fourth week it's like that's
[1215.00 - 1219.68] what I mean hey do it for three days you
[1217.88 - 1222.56] might end up at seven
[1219.68 - 1223.96] days that's what you that's okay there's
[1222.56 - 1226.56] nothing wrong with that if that's what
[1223.96 - 1229.24] you got to do I'll do it with you so
[1226.56 - 1231.04] it's really important so the deal is
[1229.24 - 1233.96] your body doesn't have to process any
[1231.04 - 1237.56] cooked food your body doesn't have to
[1233.96 - 1239.40] process any cooked food which actually
[1237.56 - 1243.00] is a little bit more of a burden on the
[1239.40 - 1244.28] body sometimes than raw food is that's
[1243.00 - 1246.32] the whole point the raw foods filled
[1244.28 - 1249.56] with all the enzymes all the fresh
[1246.32 - 1251.76] enzymes and living enzymes it does help
[1249.56 - 1253.80] digestion there's no question about it
[1251.76 - 1255.80] so even if you're you're doing paleo why
[1253.80 - 1257.20] would you eat salads if you're doing
[1255.80 - 1258.64] paleo if you're doing high protein diet
[1257.20 - 1260.04] why bother eating salads just eat meat
[1258.64 - 1262.12] three times a day just eat meat five
[1260.04 - 1264.32] times a day never touch a vegetable you
[1262.12 - 1266.92] touch a salad because salads have those
[1264.32 - 1268.36] living enzymes in them you touch a salad
[1266.92 - 1269.96] because it actually helps your animal
[1268.36 - 1271.76] protein digest there's nothing wrong
[1269.96 - 1272.88] with that and when your liver gets
[1271.76 - 1274.36] stronger and stronger and stronger
[1272.88 - 1276.60] because you do say a 28 day cleanse
[1274.36 - 1278.04] where it's all raw fruits and vegetables
[1276.60 - 1279.40] and that's all it is raw fruits and
[1278.04 - 1281.24] vegetables there's no Meats there's no
[1279.40 - 1282.64] Dairy there's no there's no eggs of
[1281.24 - 1284.20] course there's no fish but when you're
[1282.64 - 1286.04] doing that and your liver starts
[1284.20 - 1288.28] building up and your liver starts
[1286.04 - 1289.84] getting stronger and next thing know
[1288.28 - 1291.32] your bile production gets stronger it
[1289.84 - 1292.36] gets increased it gets more powerful
[1291.32 - 1293.68] next thing you know your hydrochloric
[1292.36 - 1294.80] acid in your stomach gets stronger and
[1293.68 - 1296.68] stronger and stronger and that gets
[1294.80 - 1298.36] increased and now you're able to digest
[1296.68 - 1299.96] better and better so when you bring on
[1298.36 - 1301.96] your vegetarian diet and you happen have
[1299.96 - 1303.92] fish in there you're breaking that stuff
[1301.96 - 1306.28] down better you bring on your paleo diet
[1303.92 - 1307.76] you bring on your animal protein diet
[1306.28 - 1310.04] whatever fancy name is on the animal
[1307.76 - 1312.52] protein diet and next thing you know it
[1310.04 - 1314.24] you're actually breaking down the animal
[1312.52 - 1317.48] protein better than you ever did before
[1314.24 - 1319.48] the 28d cleanse is not just a vegan
[1317.48 - 1321.80] thing it's not just a plant-based thing
[1319.48 - 1325.00] it yes it's raw fruits and vegetables so
[1321.80 - 1326.96] it is raw plant-based but it's not about
[1325.00 - 1328.32] that if you're into doing the high
[1326.96 - 1329.88] animal protein what you're doing is

[1451.68 - 1455.16] live let's get you to do the 28 day
[1453.24 - 1457.60] cleanse for a month let's get you to do
[1455.16 - 1458.68] the 28 day cleanse for month because
[1457.60 - 1460.36] guess what's going to happen you're
[1458.68 - 1463.52] going to be able to ma maximize that
[1460.36 - 1465.04] diet better you might start digesting
[1463.52 - 1467.36] those trans fatty acids that are in the
[1465.04 - 1469.56] fried oil you might start digesting that
[1467.36 - 1471.44] lard grease from this fried you know
[1469.56 - 1473.72] from like whatever the fried eggs and
[1471.44 - 1475.12] and and some Diner somewhere and the
[1473.72 - 1477.96] bacon grease and everything else you
[1475.12 - 1479.92] might be able to digest it better but
[1477.96 - 1481.48] you know what I'm trying to say you want
[1479.92 - 1483.16] to go to healthier diets you don't want
[1481.48 - 1485.56] to go to that diet but that's what I'm
[1483.16 - 1487.40] trying to say is in general is that if
[1485.56 - 1489.44] you're into like a good diet like say
[1487.40 - 1492.12] you're into a healthy paleo diet right
[1489.44 - 1493.76] say you're into a healthy ketogenic diet
[1492.12 - 1496.24] I'm not a fan of ketogenic diets I have
[1493.76 - 1498.28] to be honest say say you're you know
[1496.24 - 1500.08] you're a fan of what whatever it is
[1498.28 - 1501.80] vegetarian or however it is or all
[1500.08 - 1503.88] cooked or whatever an all cooked diet if
[1501.80 - 1506.04] you're a fan of all these this can get
[1503.88 - 1508.08] you to a place to maximize your
[1506.04 - 1509.80] bioproduction so you can break down and
[1508.08 - 1512.40] get the nutrients out of all those other
[1509.80 - 1514.32] diets that you live for or that you love
[1512.40 - 1515.68] or that you were told is the best for
[1514.32 - 1517.68] you and they seem to be healthy because
[1515.68 - 1518.96] they have no processed food no processed
[1517.68 - 1521.12] foods in there and they seem to be
[1518.96 - 1523.08] healthy because they have no no junk in
[1521.12 - 1525.36] there and all this other stuff so hey
[1523.08 - 1528.36] but you can maximize and get all the
[1525.36 - 1530.72] nutrients out of those Foods that you
[1528.36 - 1533.48] wouldn't normally get out of it before
[1530.72 - 1534.72] unless you did the 28-day cleanse
[1533.48 - 1536.52] because the 28-day cleanse is
[1534.72 - 1538.72] reestablishing your liver for the first
[1536.52 - 1540.12] time and probably your whole life the
[1538.72 - 1543.32] 20day cleanse is rebuilding your
[1540.12 - 1546.20] hydrochloric acid faster and better than
[1543.32 - 1548.04] anything could better than any HCL
[1546.20 - 1549.04] supplement which doesn't work and never
[1548.04 - 1552.48] worked for
[1549.04 - 1554.24] anybody think about that so now you can
[1552.48 - 1556.04] go hey I really believe in in this
[1554.24 - 1558.08] trendy diet I always have I've been on
[1556.04 - 1559.96] it but now you're going going to
[1558.08 - 1561.28] maximize the nutrients in that trendy
[1559.96 - 1564.00] diet that you like you're going to
[1561.28 - 1565.68] actually get more out of the diet that
[1564.00 - 1566.68] you like or whatever like you like and
[1565.68 - 1567.80] you if you don't want to go to your
[1566.68 - 1569.28] other diets you want to stay with the
[1567.80 - 1571.28] medical medium stuff you want to stay
[1569.28 - 1574.04] with the 28 day cleanse long term if you
[1571.28 - 1575.76] want to stay with the foods and also the
[1574.04 - 1577.92] 90-day cleanse in the thyroid healing
[1575.76 - 1579.56] book if you want to stay with the foods
[1577.92 - 1581.16] and life-changing foods and all the
[1579.56 - 1583.84] different recipes and everything else
[1581.16 - 1587.20] then you do that you can do that that's
[1583.84 - 1589.56] fine you can totally do that and you can
[1587.20 - 1591.32] start beating down and beating down your
[1589.56 - 1592.88] illnesses and start beating down your
[1591.32 - 1595.84] conditions and start moving yourself
[1592.88 - 1598.72] forward because look if no one ever got
[1595.84 - 1602.24] better from the 28 day cleanse if no one
[1598.72 - 1604.76] ever got better from the 28 day cleanse
[1602.24 - 1607.28] I wouldn't even be talking about it and
[1604.76 - 1609.56] I don't mean two people getting better I
[1607.28 - 1612.16] don't mean four people getting better in
[1609.56 - 1615.12] a practice of hundreds of people I don't
[1612.16 - 1616.52] mean anything like that I mean we're
[1615.12 - 1618.12] talking the thousands now we're talking
[1616.52 - 1619.24] the tens of thousands and over the years
[1618.12 - 1621.44] now we're talking the hundreds of
[1619.24 - 1624.04] thousands across the country and and and
[1621.44 - 1626.12] across the globe are getting some kind
[1624.04 - 1629.04] of benefit from the 28 day cleanse
[1626.12 - 1632.00] they're getting a benefit of some kind
[1629.04 - 1632.00] from the 28th day
[1632.08 - 1639.24] cleanse and that is a miracle because
[1637.08 - 1641.12] anything you can get out of anything and
[1639.24 - 1642.48] and it's not just you take out processed
[1641.12 - 1643.84] foods you're on a trendy diet you take
[1642.48 - 1645.24] out processed foods you take out
[1643.84 - 1646.88] something and you start feeling a little
[1645.24 - 1648.72] better no this is different this is for
[1646.88 - 1650.88] people who really struggle who really
[1648.72 - 1652.84] need healing who really need to get rid
[1650.88 - 1654.80] of illnesses who tried all the different
[1652.84 - 1656.96] trendy diets of all them the elimination
[1654.80 - 1659.24] diets everything last one this is this
[1656.96 - 1661.16] is one of those things those tools that
[1659.24 - 1663.16] Spirit gave me a long time ago when I
[1661.16 - 1665.32] was a kid that actually got people out
[1663.16 - 1668.56] of the worst trouble in the worst jams
[1665.32 - 1670.68] and because it has the power to do so it
[1668.56 - 1672.36] has the power to do so but you got to
[1670.68 - 1673.76] work with it and you got to start with
[1672.36 - 1675.28] it and you got to see where you can go
[1673.76 - 1676.84] with it maybe you can do it for a week
[1675.28 - 1678.48] maybe you can do it for 6 months
[1676.84 - 1679.52] depending on what condition you have
[1678.48 - 1681.44] I've seen people where they're just
[1679.52 - 1683.00] Gravely ill and it took four years of
[1681.44 - 1686.32] doing it but they were Gravely ill for
[1683.00 - 1688.44] 20 years and the four years they did it
[1686.32 - 1689.88] straight consecutively got them right
[1688.44 - 1692.68] out of the woods they lived their life
[1689.88 - 1695.16] for the first time ever in year and
[1692.68 - 1696.60] decades but either way some people it's
[1695.16 - 1698.08] fast some people it's slower some people
[1696.60 - 1699.92] they instantly start feeling better hey
[1698.08 - 1701.56] oh my God I'm not Les I'm less achy I'm
[1699.92 - 1703.24] less painy and that's what people say
[1701.56 - 1704.84] all the time like oh my God my digestion
[1703.24 - 1706.68] I'm not bloating as much and somebody
[1704.84 - 1709.36] might say oh my God for some reason my
[1706.68 - 1710.76] doctor said my liver enzymes are down
[1709.36 - 1713.16] and my blood pressure is down a little
[1710.76 - 1716.08] bit someone else might say hey look you
[1713.16 - 1718.00] know my Gout symptoms are down somebody
[1716.08 - 1720.44] else might say my sertic arthritis is
[1718.00 - 1722.00] actually better it's it's like that and
[1720.44 - 1723.44] everybody has a different load different
[1722.00 - 1724.88] things different viruses different
[1723.44 - 1726.76] problems different bugs it's important
[1724.88 - 1728.16] to get the medical medium book one or
[1726.76 - 1729.84] any of the other medical medium books so
[1728.16 - 1731.24] you can also see what other kinds of
[1729.84 - 1732.72] things like supplements for different
[1731.24 - 1735.40] conditions and everything else in case
[1732.72 - 1736.88] you are one of those but the 28 day
[1735.40 - 1738.40] cleanse speaks for itself in so many
[1736.88 - 1741.44] different ways
[1738.40 - 1744.00] it speaks for itself so many different
[1741.44 - 1747.04] way so many different ways It's
[1744.00 - 1748.96] amazing And you the bottom line is it's
[1747.04 - 1751.80] all about you healing your loved ones
[1748.96 - 1753.64] your family it's all about you guys
[1751.80 - 1756.88] that's what it that's what it's all
[1753.64 - 1758.60] about it really is and see when you
[1756.88 - 1760.68] think about that hey who can I get on
[1758.60 - 1762.48] the 28 day cleans let me just see if I
[1760.68 - 1764.20] can take a couple of days out of 28 day
[1762.48 - 1767.48] cleanse and get my family member to do
[1764.20 - 1768.92] it a little bit let me just see if I can
[1767.48 - 1771.48] get somebody to do the celery juice out
[1768.92 - 1774.28] of the 28 day cleanse the original
[1771.48 - 1776.28] original source of celery juice by
[1774.28 - 1779.44] itself is in book one medical medium
[1776.28 - 1781.80] 28-day cleanse it's in the book that's
[1779.44 - 1783.24] the original source and before that
[1781.80 - 1785.76] there were other original sources that I
[1783.24 - 1787.68] put out there going back teaching people
[1785.76 - 1790.00] how to do Straight celery juice and
[1787.68 - 1791.36] being the only source for that and the
[1790.00 - 1793.12] reason why is cuz Spirit knew what
[1791.36 - 1795.04] helped people heal and how to get them
[1793.12 - 1796.72] healed and how to get them better and
[1795.04 - 1799.36] how to give them a chance in a break in
[1796.72 - 1800.80] life when all seemed lost and hopeless
[1799.36 - 1802.56] and all seemed down and they weren't
[1800.80 - 1805.52] getting the right information that
[1802.56 - 1808.68] celery juice has been the miracle the
[1805.52 - 1811.32] miracle along the way and it's in this
[1808.68 - 1814.28] book for a reason Spirit wanted it in
[1811.32 - 1817.12] this book it wasn't just for me helping
[1814.28 - 1818.64] people in in in in in the medical median
[1817.12 - 1820.60] practice all these years helping out
[1818.64 - 1823.08] clients over and over and over again all
[1820.60 - 1826.40] these decades it wasn't just for them
[1823.08 - 1827.76] and it was for everybody and it's yours
[1826.40 - 1829.36] so let's talk about the morning what can
[1827.76 - 1830.92] we do it's this is that we're talking
[1829.36 - 1833.84] about raw fruits and vegetables don't
[1830.92 - 1837.88] get nervous though we can also curtail
[1833.84 - 1840.12] it we can shift it a little bit we can
[1837.88 - 1842.80] do that we can curtail it we can shift
[1840.12 - 1845.16] it a little bit we can make it a little
[1842.80 - 1847.24] bit different if we have to so don't
[1845.16 - 1848.88] panic yet when you hear raw fruits and
[1847.24 - 1851.28] vegetables do not
[1848.88 - 1852.96] panic so we start out let's just say
[1851.28 - 1855.88] we're doing the raw fruits and
[1852.96 - 1857.28] vegetables version of 28 day cleanse you
[1855.88 - 1859.00] start with the with the cleansing
[1857.28 - 1863.64] beverage in the morning celery juice is
[1859.00 - 1867.40] one option cucumber juice is one option
[1863.64 - 1868.92] lemon water is one option coconut water
[1867.40 - 1871.96] is one
[1868.92 - 1874.60] option that's an option all on its
[1871.96 - 1876.56] own so I mean you just if that's what
[1874.60 - 1878.48] you got to do for the 28 day cleanse
[1876.56 - 1880.52] that's what you got to do so that's an
[1878.48 - 1882.20] option all on its own and you can do
[1880.52 - 1883.60] this you can actually get in some of
[1882.20 - 1885.04] this you can do a cucumber juice if you
[1883.60 - 1886.24] can't do that let's get a coconut water
[1885.04 - 1888.64] if you can't do that let's get a lemon
[1886.24 - 1890.76] water meaning lemon squeezed in a glass
[1888.64 - 1892.80] of water let's do that if we have
[1890.76 - 1896.16] to let's do
[1892.80 - 1897.40] it and we can do that that's really
[1896.16 - 1899.76] important so you could start the day
[1897.40 - 1902.44] with a cleansing cleansing beverage
[1899.76 - 1904.08] celery juice cucumber juice lemon water
[1902.44 - 1907.88] coconut water with
[1904.08 - 1910.84] spirulina I mean we can do that too and
[1907.88 - 1913.92] I mean we have so many options herbal
[1910.84 - 1916.52] tea um you know the barley grass juice
[1913.92 - 1917.96] powder that I love so much you know if
[1916.52 - 1919.44] you want to know which one look at look
[1917.96 - 1920.88] you know you'll see which one you go to
[1919.44 - 1924.72] my directory the barley grass juice
[1920.88 - 1926.68] powder in water that could even work but
[1924.72 - 1928.72] you have the option of doing some
[1926.68 - 1931.60] different things for a cleansing morning
[1928.72 - 1934.04] a cleansing morning breakfast really
[1931.60 - 1936.12] important so let's go it's basically the
[1934.04 - 1937.88] early morning that's before we start any
[1936.12 - 1939.24] kind of real breakfast but we prepare
[1937.88 - 1940.84] for that breakfast the breakfast is

[2194.20 - 2200.08] many people I remember using that for so
[2197.64 - 2202.84] long ago to get people better it's like
[2200.08 - 2205.52] a creamy it's a creamy dinner it's a
[2202.84 - 2208.68] suppertime spinach soup so you take two
[2205.52 - 2210.80] bunches of spinach three medium to large

[2212.76 - 2216.72] can get all the details in the book to
[2214.44 - 2219.24] really have it down right you can
[2216.72 - 2221.56] squeeze Orange in there use a stock of
[2219.24 - 2223.24] celery and add some cilantro and a
[2221.56 - 2225.60] little bit of garlic if you like you put

[2225.60 - 2229.72] blend it up and it comes out nice and
[2228.08 - 2231.28] creamy nice and delicious you can chop
[2229.72 - 2233.32] tomatoes and put it on top you can put a
[2231.28 - 2235.32] little Atlantic Sea dolls on top some
[2233.32 - 2236.88] chopped scallions these are some of the
[2235.32 - 2238.48] things you can do that spinach soup if
[2236.88 - 2239.96] you eat it every day the things that it
[2238.48 - 2241.84] can do for you people say oh I eat
[2239.96 - 2243.84] spinach I eat spinach that's what people
[2241.84 - 2246.28] say they'll be like oh I eat
[2243.84 - 2247.92] spinach that's what they'll do I'll eat
[2246.28 - 2249.76] spinach
[2247.92 - 2252.20] and and and I'll say really what what
[2249.76 - 2253.92] what what do you mean tell me about it
[2252.20 - 2255.32] okay well I had some spinach I I think I
[2253.92 - 2258.52] had some spinach on my salad it was
[2255.32 - 2260.36] mixed in in the greens it was last week
[2258.52 - 2263.44] I'm like okay the difference here when
[2260.36 - 2266.56] you're doing the creamy spinach soup the
[2263.44 - 2268.60] raw spinach soup every single night for
[2266.56 - 2270.16] a little while and you can change it off
[2268.60 - 2271.76] if we want to do modifications and I'll
[2270.16 - 2275.08] talk about that in a minute but every
[2271.76 - 2276.76] night what it can do is UN it's it's
[2275.08 - 2279.04] unimaginable actually because what what
[2276.76 - 2281.20] happens is I've seen it turn people
[2279.04 - 2284.60] around conditions you can't even believe
[2281.20 - 2286.48] skin conditions acne I mean it's just
[2284.60 - 2288.28] it's endless I've seen people with eye
[2286.48 - 2290.72] problems start to disappear because
[2288.28 - 2293.36] they're doing the spinach soup the kotes
[2290.72 - 2295.08] literally the spinach the power and the
[2293.36 - 2297.48] vitamins and spinach to that degree
[2295.08 - 2299.32] blend it up so your body digests it so
[2297.48 - 2302.08] easy including all the different enzymes
[2299.32 - 2303.44] that are in it it's really that amazing
[2302.08 - 2304.96] and the thing is you're not adding in
[2303.44 - 2308.32] all these bad foods cuz people will say
[2304.96 - 2311.36] well I had spinach with something else I
[2308.32 - 2312.96] had spinach with my whatever and that
[2311.36 - 2314.56] whatever wasn't that great it was
[2312.96 - 2316.12] burdening the liver giving people
[2314.56 - 2318.12] problems it was giving them have a hard
[2316.12 - 2320.40] time they weren't able to heal remember
[2318.12 - 2322.28] this is about clearing the air giving
[2320.40 - 2324.16] you some Freedom getting you better so
[2322.28 - 2326.04] you can actually do this and heal that's
[2324.16 - 2329.08] what this is all about very
[2326.04 - 2330.56] important so moving into the evening if
[2329.08 - 2332.20] you're still hungry after dinner you can
[2330.56 - 2334.84] snack on an apple and a date now listen
[2332.20 - 2336.88] some people who do the 28 28 day cleanse
[2334.84 - 2339.76] a lot of them because it's it's a
[2336.88 - 2341.92] cleanse they end up eating like hardly
[2339.76 - 2344.48] anything so you need to know that that's
[2341.92 - 2345.92] not where you go with this you just you
[2344.48 - 2347.16] just don't say oh my God I'm on to
[2345.92 - 2348.88] cleanse because I remember I did a
[2347.16 - 2350.64] cleanse from some other guy I did a
[2348.88 - 2352.80] cleanse from some other place some other
[2350.64 - 2355.92] doctor I did a cleanse here I did a
[2352.80 - 2358.32] cleanse there and what happens is they
[2355.92 - 2359.64] end up not eating and they're like wait
[2358.32 - 2361.04] a minute I'm going to cleanse though uh
[2359.64 - 2362.44] let me just drink lemon water I don't
[2361.04 - 2363.76] want to eat I'm on a cleanse and they
[2362.44 - 2365.08] start doing that next thing you know it
[2363.76 - 2366.64] they're starving they're hungry next
[2365.08 - 2368.40] thing you know it they're crashing
[2366.64 - 2370.84] because they're back on some weird
[2368.40 - 2373.24] cleanse that's not the medical medium 28
[2370.84 - 2376.20] day cleanse and that happens all the
[2373.24 - 2377.48] time okay it doesn't happen like it is
[2376.20 - 2378.52] not everybody that goes through that
[2377.48 - 2380.20] everybody there's a lot of people that
[2378.52 - 2381.36] say no I'm doing it to the letter no I'm
[2380.20 - 2383.40] doing it the way it's supposed to be
[2381.36 - 2385.72] done no I'm doing it I got the book I'm
[2383.40 - 2387.72] doing it so what it means is if you're
[2385.72 - 2389.92] still hungry have a snack have an apple
[2387.72 - 2392.52] have a date afterwards in the evening
[2389.92 - 2394.08] you don't want to go without food you
[2392.52 - 2395.92] want to go and buy enough fruits and
[2394.08 - 2397.28] vegetables and have a stock you don't
[2395.92 - 2398.60] have to make a complicate it where
[2397.28 - 2400.20] you're in the in the grocery store not
[2398.60 - 2401.72] sure what to buy you grab the book and
[2400.20 - 2404.24] you you get the things that are in the
[2401.72 - 2405.88] book you start there and that's that
[2404.24 - 2407.52] makes it even easier it's an easier
[2405.88 - 2409.84] guide it's an easier way of doing it
[2407.52 - 2411.08] it's really a great way of doing it
[2409.84 - 2413.04] let's talk about
[2411.08 - 2415.08] modifications if you don't want to eat
[2413.04 - 2416.68] this exact menu I just kind of ran by
[2415.08 - 2418.40] you and I didn't give you every detail
[2416.68 - 2422.12] in the menu I'm only giving you some of
[2418.40 - 2424.08] them if you'd like swap out the lunch
[2422.12 - 2426.92] swap out the lunch and dinner dishes by
[2424.08 - 2428.88] eating two salads if you want to do and
[2426.92 - 2431.08] you can do two salads and have a little
[2428.88 - 2432.32] bit of like a quarter of an avocado you
[2431.08 - 2434.08] know you can make a dressing out of
[2432.32 - 2435.80] avocado you can squeeze oranges and you
[2434.08 - 2437.40] can you can put it over you can make a
[2435.80 - 2439.60] mango dressing with a little bit of
[2437.40 - 2440.72] avocado you can put it over your salads
[2439.60 - 2442.60] or you can just you know have your
[2440.72 - 2444.20] salads with all the fruit in it so you
[2442.60 - 2447.04] can do two salads a day if you really
[2444.20 - 2448.72] want to or you can do a smoothie for
[2447.04 - 2449.72] lunch and dinner I've had people do that
[2448.72 - 2451.16] all the time they're like you know I
[2449.72 - 2452.40] love the heavy metal detox smoothie can
[2451.16 - 2455.56] I have it twice a day i' be like go
[2452.40 - 2457.00] ahead absolutely get the metals out or
[2455.56 - 2458.64] somebody say well you know I really like
[2457.00 - 2460.00] the 28 day cleans smoothie can I do it
[2458.64 - 2462.68] twice a day can I do it three times a
[2460.00 - 2464.60] day you know what you can you can as
[2462.68 - 2466.32] long as you're eating I know it's not
[2464.60 - 2467.88] about a starvation diet this is not a
[2466.32 - 2470.60] starvation diet this isn't about
[2467.88 - 2473.76] stopping eating this isn't about eating
[2470.60 - 2476.48] no more it's about eating
[2473.76 - 2477.56] more so that's that's the whole thing
[2476.48 - 2479.92] here so you could cycle through
[2477.56 - 2483.44] different salad greens so salad soup
[2479.92 - 2485.76] greens if you need to as well I mean
[2483.44 - 2489.92] that's the whole thing don't pay any
[2485.76 - 2493.28] mind to the myth that spinach will harm
[2489.92 - 2495.36] you when it's raw it's the opposite
[2493.28 - 2498.20] cooked spinach is the one where the
[2495.36 - 2500.92] where the the oxyc acid actually tends
[2498.20 - 2503.16] to run and become
[2500.92 - 2505.96] destabilized that's the problem right
[2503.16 - 2508.52] there I can't believe to this day the
[2505.96 - 2510.68] spinach myth has been flipped and it's
[2508.52 - 2511.96] flipped where raw bad and Cook's
[2510.68 - 2514.28] actually the way to do it for spinach
[2511.96 - 2515.92] it's the opposite raw spinach is this is
[2514.28 - 2519.24] the way to do it to get the miraculous
[2515.92 - 2522.44] benefit without any harm at all on any
[2519.24 - 2525.36] level and you know and that's something
[2522.44 - 2527.08] to really really understand so that's
[2525.36 - 2529.60] misinformation out there you want
[2527.08 - 2531.84] spinach in its raw form it's not like
[2529.60 - 2534.44] other vegetables you can steam you don't
[2531.84 - 2536.00] want spinach cooked or sauteed if you
[2534.44 - 2538.08] eat raw spinach soup every day for a
[2536.00 - 2539.60] month it will be the best thing you ever
[2538.08 - 2542.76] done for yourself I'm going to repeat
[2539.60 - 2545.96] this if you eat raw spinach soup every
[2542.76 - 2546.72] day for one month it will be the best
[2545.96 - 2549.36] thing
[2546.72 - 2551.64] you've ever done for
[2549.36 - 2554.40] yourself don't be afraid to eat as many
[2551.64 - 2558.16] greens as you'd like too and this is
[2554.40 - 2560.68] this is all important to do it's okay to
[2558.16 - 2563.92] to eat an entire meal of just fruit if
[2560.68 - 2565.72] you had to perfectly fine actually if
[2563.92 - 2567.84] that's what you want to do so these are
[2565.72 - 2569.68] some of the different options you can
[2567.84 - 2571.48] balance it with a few celery sticks and
[2569.68 - 2573.76] maybe even some celery juice in the
[2571.48 - 2576.36] morning which would be amazing I never
[2573.76 - 2578.92] told anybody in my life to only eat
[2576.36 - 2581.64] fruit and fruit only and that's it where
[2578.92 - 2585.88] it's fruit only with nothing else never
[2581.64 - 2588.88] have I ever told anybody in my life to
[2585.88 - 2591.00] do that but yet misinformation goes
[2588.88 - 2592.80] around hear people like oh he's all
[2591.00 - 2596.04] about fruit you only eat fruit yeah sure
[2592.80 - 2599.44] sure sure never said it in my life I
[2596.04 - 2601.32] mean you could eat only fruit you could
[2599.44 - 2603.52] but in the medical medium 20day cleanse
[2601.32 - 2605.48] you'd be doing celery sticks you'd be
[2603.52 - 2607.48] doing the other options too it would
[2605.48 - 2609.64] just be fruit for dinner see this is
[2607.48 - 2611.56] what I'm talking about and very
[2609.64 - 2612.96] important to understand you can do
[2611.56 - 2615.20] alternative meal you can do an
[2612.96 - 2616.96] alternative meal making a mango salsa
[2615.20 - 2619.00] put it on put it on salads if you need
[2616.96 - 2620.56] to could chop up mangoes tomatoes
[2619.00 - 2623.36] cucumbers don't be afraid of tomatoes
[2620.56 - 2625.64] whatever you do do not get suckered in
[2623.36 - 2627.52] to propaganda against Tomatoes you just
[2625.64 - 2629.16] be cheating yourself and you know what
[2627.52 - 2630.36] when you cheat yourself out of the truth
[2629.16 - 2631.96] and you cheat yourself out what your
[2630.36 - 2633.60] body needs and you cheat yourself out of
[2631.96 - 2636.92] the very things that reverse disease and
[2633.60 - 2640.76] illness and conditions and symptoms it's
[2636.92 - 2642.40] a disaster it's it's just horrible it's
[2640.76 - 2644.12] horrible don't cheat yourself out
[2642.40 - 2647.00] because of somebody wanting to make
[2644.12 - 2649.36] money on some grandioso idea out there
[2647.00 - 2652.28] and starts to slam something that
[2649.36 - 2655.56] actually heals the body just be careful
[2652.28 - 2657.44] out there so you can do that mangoes
[2655.56 - 2660.20] chop up mangoes Tomatoes cucumber celery

[2668.96 - 2672.60] cucumber noodles you can put spinach
[2670.60 - 2674.32] soup over cucumber noodles something I
[2672.60 - 2676.96] forgot to tell you earlier see all the
[2674.32 - 2679.84] amazing things you can do and in the
[2676.96 - 2681.92] place of avocado orange dressing which
[2679.84 - 2683.80] is in this book by the way an avocado
[2681.92 - 2685.64] orange dressing for the 28 day cleanse
[2683.80 - 2688.52] try mashing up some
[2685.64 - 2690.28] guacamole top that on your salad
[2688.52 - 2693.24] sprinkle it with some lime
[2690.28 - 2695.56] juice so another great detox dish is a
[2693.24 - 2697.92] food processor grind up so you're doing
[2695.56 - 2700.48] a food processor grinding up apples and
[2697.92 - 2704.16] cauliflower and even a little cabbage in
[2700.48 - 2706.76] there the point is you have options just
[2704.16 - 2711.44] remember your Mantra though raw fruits
[2706.76 - 2714.40] and vegetables 28 days of it and that's
[2711.44 - 2716.56] what matters right there it matters
[2714.40 - 2718.48] right there now hey wait a minute what
[2716.56 - 2721.08] if you can't do raw what if you're
[2718.48 - 2722.72] nervous what if you don't want to do raw
[2721.08 - 2725.08] what if you're scared because you hear
[2722.72 - 2727.00] about you know raw Foodies and you hear
[2725.08 - 2728.48] about stuff like that
[2727.00 - 2730.28] you know and and some people get
[2728.48 - 2732.32] intimidated and some people just get
[2730.28 - 2734.96] they get spooked by it if you hear
[2732.32 - 2737.20] something like that don't get thrown you
[2734.96 - 2740.52] can there's what you can do if you
[2737.20 - 2742.24] really have to if you really have to add
[2740.52 - 2745.68] in a cooked
[2742.24 - 2748.08] option add in a cooked option I'm trying
[2745.68 - 2751.80] to work with you for sure add in a
[2748.08 - 2755.56] cooked option like a potato so a steamed
[2751.80 - 2758.28] potato not baked potato a steamed potato
[2755.56 - 2761.52] steamed only you have it chopped up and
[2758.28 - 2764.24] thrown on your salad as a dinner
[2761.52 - 2767.48] option now if you're not getting you
[2764.24 - 2769.00] know the greatest results ever it might
[2767.48 - 2772.04] it's don't think it's because you got
[2769.00 - 2773.48] the potato on there which you you've not
[2772.04 - 2775.04] getting the greatest results ever you
[2773.48 - 2776.72] just got to do the 28 day cleanse as
[2775.04 - 2777.92] long as you can you can do it for a week
[2776.72 - 2780.08] you can do it for two weeks you can do
[2777.92 - 2781.64] it three weeks you can do it four weeks
[2780.08 - 2783.08] and that potato is going to do great for
[2781.64 - 2786.28] you because it is healing and it can
[2783.08 - 2788.40] help you heal so it is an option and I'm
[2786.28 - 2791.08] saying don't blame the potato if you're
[2788.40 - 2792.96] not getting a result quick or anything
[2791.08 - 2795.16] like that because there's potato
[2792.96 - 2796.68] propaganda trying to destroy the the
[2795.16 - 2798.08] healthy potatoes that actually help us
[2796.68 - 2800.36] heal and get us better and everything
[2798.08 - 2802.68] else it's just that the 28 day cleanse
[2800.36 - 2805.84] I'm trying to maximize all the raw food
[2802.68 - 2809.20] enzymes but the potato will be perfectly
[2805.84 - 2810.72] fine if you need that option so giving
[2809.20 - 2813.76] you that option the other option would
[2810.72 - 2816.72] be butternut squash or winter squash of
[2813.76 - 2819.84] some kind steaming it not baking it with
[2816.72 - 2822.64] olive oil steaming it and having some
[2819.84 - 2825.28] slices of it or having some of that um
[2822.64 - 2826.60] some pieces of the butternut squash or
[2825.28 - 2828.84] cut it up in squares whatever you want
[2826.60 - 2830.72] to do and steam it and put that in your
[2828.84 - 2833.52] salad so that's another great option too
[2830.72 - 2835.36] so you feel like hey wait a minute I can
[2833.52 - 2837.88] actually do just you know a couple
[2835.36 - 2840.76] little cooked options at dinner it has
[2837.88 - 2843.08] to be at dinner time it really
[2840.76 - 2844.24] does so if you need and I'm talking
[2843.08 - 2845.92] about this if you need to pull back the
[2844.24 - 2848.60] rains on this diet by swapping out
[2845.92 - 2851.92] spinach soup dinner for a meal of Simply
[2848.60 - 2854.80] cooked vegetables Steam and roast them
[2851.92 - 2856.52] it's not going to be responsible for why
[2854.80 - 2858.88] you didn't get a result after the first
[2856.52 - 2860.88] day of doing it don't be like oh no I'm
[2858.88 - 2862.56] doing the steam cooked vegetables and
[2860.88 - 2866.28] maybe that's why I'm not better in 3
[2862.56 - 2869.04] days no no no no no you can do you can
[2866.28 - 2870.52] pull back the rains you can swap things
[2869.04 - 2871.72] out if you're really have to you're
[2870.52 - 2872.84] still going to get benefits you're still
[2871.72 - 2875.12] going to move forward you're still going
[2872.84 - 2877.76] to be doing some great things but I
[2875.12 - 2879.52] still would like for you to maximize the
[2877.76 - 2881.40] quickest quickest quickest the most
[2879.52 - 2883.56] powerfullest of course doing it raw 28
[2881.40 - 2884.72] Days Raw but you have these options and
[2883.56 - 2886.48] they're not going to get in your way
[2884.72 - 2888.84] they're going to help you so you do some
[2886.48 - 2891.04] simply cooked vegetables you can you
[2888.84 - 2892.68] know you can even you know do some other
[2891.04 - 2894.88] things too you got the winter squash I
[2892.68 - 2897.48] talked about you got zucchini you can
[2894.88 - 2900.16] play with too by steaming that potatoes
[2897.48 - 2903.48] yams even some broccoli and califlour
[2900.16 - 2905.20] and even steaming asparagus you can do
[2903.48 - 2908.20] that if you need to put it on your
[2905.20 - 2910.04] salads at night at the end of the day
[2908.20 - 2913.80] that's how you do it so you put it on
[2910.04 - 2915.40] salads at night at the end of the day
[2913.80 - 2916.60] and that would be really you know that
[2915.40 - 2918.40] would be a great way of doing it because
[2916.60 - 2919.28] I know so many of you might be like hey
[2918.40 - 2922.12] wait a
[2919.28 - 2924.16] minute no way it's you're many of you be
[2922.12 - 2925.92] like no way I can't do the raw I can't
[2924.16 - 2929.04] do the raw cleanse and I know many of
[2925.92 - 2931.36] you guys can so but the but but if you
[2929.04 - 2933.72] feel like you can't don't don't feel
[2931.36 - 2936.36] pressured you know bring in what I just
[2933.72 - 2938.44] said as the dinner option put a little
[2936.36 - 2940.56] bit of those very things I just said the
[2938.44 - 2942.64] steamed vegetables steamed potato
[2940.56 - 2945.52] steamed butternut squash put that on top
[2942.64 - 2947.36] of your salad or your spinach salad or
[2945.52 - 2950.28] even your lettuce salad at the end of
[2947.36 - 2951.72] the day and have that for dinner and
[2950.28 - 2955.56] start back up all over again in the
[2951.72 - 2958.96] morning and keep on going you might even
[2955.56 - 2961.12] find you might even find yourself
[2958.96 - 2962.72] actually eventually saying you know what
[2961.12 - 2964.16] I don't need to do the steamed vegetable
[2962.72 - 2966.48] at the end of the day I'm actually good
[2964.16 - 2968.24] just give me the salad give me the salad
[2966.48 - 2971.04] and I'm good you might actually head in
[2968.24 - 2972.36] that direction you might be there how
[2971.04 - 2975.36] amazing is
[2972.36 - 2981.08] that you might even be there on that
[2975.36 - 2984.48] level so the body is forgiving the body
[2981.08 - 2986.96] is forgiving it really is when we're
[2984.48 - 2988.96] giving it the things we need when we're
[2986.96 - 2991.28] giving it the things that the body
[2988.96 - 2993.44] really truly needs and loves so let's
[2991.28 - 2995.12] recap what is the power of the 28 day
[2993.44 - 2996.92] cleanse the medical medium 28- day
[2995.12 - 2999.32] cleanse what is the power what are we
[2996.92 - 3001.88] talking about what's the deal that we're
[2999.32 - 3003.60] talking about here okay first of all
[3001.88 - 3006.08] we're rebuilding our hydrochloric acid
[3003.60 - 3007.56] in the stomach that's the gastric juices
[3006.08 - 3010.52] the seven blend that I talk about in
[3007.56 - 3012.12] medical medium book one we're restoring
[3010.52 - 3013.84] and that's the Undiscovered hydrochloric
[3012.12 - 3015.32] acid complex that's actually in your
[3013.84 - 3017.24] stomach that science of research hasn't
[3015.32 - 3019.24] even discovered yet we're restoring that
[3017.24 - 3021.04] to help break down food digest food and
[3019.24 - 3023.84] to move you forward what else are we
[3021.04 - 3024.80] doing we're we're cleansing and cleaning
[3023.84 - 3026.72] out a liver that could have
[3024.80 - 3028.36] Pharmaceutical in it old antibiotics
[3026.72 - 3031.52] anti-depressants who knows what else is
[3028.36 - 3033.76] in there any kind of drug it can have
[3031.52 - 3036.96] anything recreational drugs from 2030
[3033.76 - 3038.72] years ago it can have um petrochemicals
[3036.96 - 3040.64] you know air fresheners all kinds of
[3038.72 - 3042.28] toxins everything else on the sun could
[3040.64 - 3044.00] easily be in their perfumes colognes
[3042.28 - 3045.72] they're all inside the liver you don't
[3044.00 - 3047.04] think they are in there they're in there
[3045.72 - 3048.72] you want to live in denial we can live
[3047.04 - 3050.92] in denial but they're in there the liver
[3048.72 - 3052.72] takes it on all of it every last bit of
[3050.92 - 3053.44] it heavy metals included and what are
[3052.72 - 3055.80] you
[3053.44 - 3057.16] doing you're you're actually getting
[3055.80 - 3058.64] your liver back taking it out of
[3057.16 - 3060.60] sluggishness taking it out of fatty
[3058.64 - 3062.60] liver restoring it making the bile
[3060.60 - 3066.80] production stronger and that bile goes
[3062.60 - 3068.84] right into Theo digestive tract and what
[3066.80 - 3070.36] does it do it breaks down rancid fats
[3068.84 - 3073.08] that have been making you sick for years
[3070.36 - 3075.84] and years and years putrified rancid sat
[3073.08 - 3077.76] putrified rancid fats that have been
[3075.84 - 3079.12] literally along the lining of the
[3077.76 - 3080.52] intestinal tract and colon and even
[3079.12 - 3083.80] bottom of the stomach and it starts to
[3080.52 - 3085.92] break all that down and eat it up 20th
[3083.80 - 3088.12] day cleanse is going to do a lot for
[3085.92 - 3090.40] your liver your body it's going to help
[3088.12 - 3092.04] feed nutrients to your central nervous
[3090.40 - 3093.52] system so you can start repairing from
[3092.04 - 3095.48] all the different neurological symptoms
[3093.52 - 3097.84] we suffer from that I covered and many
[3095.48 - 3099.84] more at the beginning of the
[3097.84 - 3102.68] show it's going to help support your
[3099.84 - 3104.04] adrenals make your adrenals uh Stronger
[3102.68 - 3105.84] because when you're eating like the
[3104.04 - 3107.40] snacks in between and everything else it
[3105.84 - 3108.48] helps to support your adrenals if
[3107.40 - 3113.04] someone tells you you should only eat
[3108.48 - 3114.92] twice a day once a day no no no no no
[3113.04 - 3116.28] actually no it's not that's not how you
[3114.92 - 3118.20] restore your your adrenals it's not how
[3116.28 - 3120.52] you st not how you do
[3118.20 - 3122.36] it I mean you can do some intermittent
[3120.52 - 3124.20] fasting you know along the way there's
[3122.36 - 3126.04] other ways of doing you can you can eat
[3124.20 - 3128.00] light you can do some different stuff
[3126.04 - 3129.76] but it's not good to be doing that long
[3128.00 - 3132.24] term forever you got to make sure you're
[3129.76 - 3134.56] supporting the adrenals and and in
[3132.24 - 3136.92] medical medium I talk about all about
[3134.56 - 3138.72] that making it better and better so
[3136.92 - 3140.32] you're restoring your adrenals you're
[3138.72 - 3141.88] actually helping there you're also
[3140.32 - 3144.68] lowering your viral load because you're
[3141.88 - 3147.36] not eating foods like eggs and cheese
[3144.68 - 3150.64] and other things that feed and gluten
[3147.36 - 3152.92] that feed viruses to make you sick
[3150.64 - 3154.64] because that's why people are sick
[3152.92 - 3157.76] someone said to me I mean just recently

[3157.76 - 3163.28] got pain here my something hurts over
[3160.52 - 3164.64] here um and and you know and I don't
[3163.28 - 3165.72] know what it is it's just the doctors
[3164.64 - 3167.40] can't figure it out they ran me through
[3165.72 - 3169.00] CAT scans MRIs they've done every test
[3167.40 - 3170.20] in the book every blood test in the book
[3169.00 - 3172.76] they fixed all my nutritional
[3170.20 - 3174.76] deficiencies they gave me $2,000 $2,000
[3172.76 - 3176.68] of uh uh every two weeks of supplements
[3174.76 - 3179.00] I had a person purchase but I'm still
[3176.68 - 3181.32] hurting and what the hell is it Go did

[3183.40 - 3186.12] might have tighters for it they said
[3184.72 - 3189.28] it's not the problem though and they
[3186.12 - 3191.72] said I go yeah it's the problem and the
[3189.28 - 3194.12] 28 day cleanse helps starve out the
[3191.72 - 3196.04] virus without starving you starving out
[3194.12 - 3197.40] the viruses without starving you so you
