70
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:23,840
experience

71
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:26,560
every other sentence and it really is

72
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,680
this is different i mean this is another

73
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,160
level

74
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,239
of medical medium information that's

75
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,160
going to change how health is out there

76
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,000
just like the other books have you know

77
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,000
like neurological lyme they now test

78
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,760
repsting var with lyme why are they

79
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,840
testing for epstein barks medical medium

80
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,160
said i've seen bars behind lyme disease

81
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,720
and now all the lyme doctors are kind of

82
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,160
not caring about the bacteria myth in

83
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,400
theory anymore they're actually all

84
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,560
looking for epstein-barr it's incredible

85
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,400
what the medical union books have done

86
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,200
reserving a book is critical and i know

87
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,080
look

88
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,599
i get it i'm doing it live right now

89
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,200
this is my third live talking about the

90
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:03,040
brain saver books

91
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,680
blah blah blah

92
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,360
but you got to reserve a book

93
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,319
because

94
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,000
when when the books are released they'll

95
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:13,519
sell out real quick that's what happens

96
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,360
with the medical media books and then if

97
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,440
you're sick or you have a symptom or you

98
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,959
really need it for a friend or you need

99
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,599
it for a neighbor or a family member or

100
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:24,640
a loved one you gotta wait and you gotta

101
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:26,239
wait a long time possibly so reserving a

102
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,599
book is critical you're not gonna get

103
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,480
charged for it

104
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,640
and

105
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,159
it's so inexpensive

106
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,680
and i have people tell me every day a

107
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:35,599
friend of mine said

108
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,680
i had a i had a friend over right a

109
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,680
practitioner friend over to hang out for

110
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,360
a little bit known for years and he

111
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,720
grabbed on to these and he said this is

112
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,879
incredible

113
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,400
he goes but why are you doing this i'm

114
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:49,920
like what are you talking about why

115
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,840
don't you chop these up

116
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,720
into like

117
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,319
like books like smaller books or why

118
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,480
don't you and he's sitting here trying

119
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,519
to figure out how i can make money

120
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,439
he says

121
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,200
why don't you make programs out of these

122
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,959
books and just

123
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,560
and just literally everybody has to do

124
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,480
this they have to pay for the program or

125
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,040
whatever i go no

126
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:14,720
no i i want to make sure everybody has

127
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:17,280

00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:11,040
an ocd label they're doing that

325
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,000

know so many people have it where they

608
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:06,799
disconnect it from themselves and they

609
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:08,320
don't even feel like they exist

610
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:10,320
but then they come out of it and then

611
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:12,400
they feel guilt and they feel pain and

612
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,760
depression and then they go back into it

613
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,640
and they just they feel like they're

614
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,400

don't feel like they you know they feel

619
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:25,440
just lost it's the personalization they

620
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,559
feel like they're missing out on

621
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,559
something all the time they feel a

622
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:30,159
sadness and they can't explain it they

623
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:31,360
feel like they can't connect to somebody

624
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:32,640
else and talk to them they feel like

625
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,159
they don't hear them when someone's

626
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,679
talking to them that they don't they

627
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:38,080
can't even hear the person talking to

628
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:39,679
them right hannah says yes that's how it

629
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,039
feels

630
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:42,720
yeah

631
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:44,480
um centaur's healing said the

632
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,320
personalization is so hard to go through

633
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,559
so you must have gone through so much

634
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:50,480
alexander sophia says what about grief

635
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:51,919
does that happen to the brain exactly

636
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,520
that's what we're talking about all of

637
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:56,480
that and what happens if you guys just

00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:59,120
people are going to develop that in

697
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,640
these next coming years they're already

698
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,159
developing that you hear that there's

699
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,840
pockets and clusters of people and

700
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:05,360
they're they're losing their minds right

701
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:08,000
now

702
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,840
their brains just like getting eaten up

703
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,640
you're gonna see a lot of that you guys

704
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:15,279
you're gonna see a lot of that happening

705
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:17,279
where there's clusters and doctors and

706
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:18,880
small towns are noticing it because in

707
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:20,080
the cities they don't keep track of that

708
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,840
stuff

709
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:24,559
they don't right

710
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:27,360
but they're seeing clusters of it in

711
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:29,360
small towns around the world in villages

712
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:32,400
where groups of people they're just

713
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:33,120
brains are getting eaten eaten up eating

714
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,039
up

715
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,559
and in the big cities and in all that

716
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:38,559
they keep that all under wraps no one

717
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:40,400
talks about it doesn't even matter but

718
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:43,120
they're noticing it in the villages and

719
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,840
the towns around the world

720
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:47,520
people's brains are basically

721
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:49,279
dissolving like at 40 years old 50 years

722
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,720
old whatever i mean it's incredible

723
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:53,120
what's happening

724
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:56,559
anyway encephalopathy

725
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:58,640
these books are going to be the key

726
00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:00,720
i don't expect everybody to get a book

727
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,640
i expect you know anybody to find it i

728
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,080
expect hopefully a lot of people find it

729
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,840
but i know that the world is just

730
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:08,159
there's everybody gets derailed with all

731
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:09,600
the different trends and things and

732
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:10,720
but these are life-saving in here for

733
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,480
people when they do come to that

734
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:16,640
realization that they need this book or

735
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:18,559
they get led but you know divinely led

736
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,559

737
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:23,679

hyperhidrosis you know the sweating

743
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:37,840
where everybody gets they go to try to

744
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:40,080
get the surgery they cut the sympathetic

745
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,679
nerve and all that and people go through

two books released at one time first of

966

its kind no publisher would ever let an

967
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,399
author do it plus authors don't have it

968
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:54,399
in them from what i heard from my

969
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:57,279
publisher to do two at the same moment

970
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:59,039
like this so it's the first of its kind

971
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:00,960
two books at the same time and the

972
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:02,880

they are

982
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:26,480
right

983
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,839
but you know that's just the way things

984
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,280
roll

985
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:32,879

there's 14 cleanses in here there's an

989
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:39,040
advanced heavy metal detox cleanse

990
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,480
there's seven

991
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:44,960
levels

992
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:47,679
of heavy metal detox in this book

993
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:49,280
seven levels heavy metal detox

994
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:50,639
there's something

995
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:54,159
that i put a

996
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:55,520
like therapy in these books that's

997
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:56,879
called brain

998
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:58,560
shot

999
00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:01,520
therapy

1000
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:04,720
so that's that alone is going to help so

1001
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:05,839
many people brain shot therapy okay

1002
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:08,079
yeah

1003
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:10,000
the problem is when people learn medical

1004
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:12,400
mean information from other sources out

1005
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,800
there they don't get pointed back to the

1006
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:17,040
original source instead

1007
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,880
they get given things that can hurt your

1008
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:21,119
health they'll get told to activate a

1009
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:23,119
charcoal which will literally tear your

1010
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:25,280
guts up

1011
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:27,839
ruin your intestinal tract environment

1012
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,520
it could take years to restore your

1013
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:31,839
intestinal tract environment after using

1014
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:34,480
activated charcoal so

1015
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:36,079
that's just one example of so many right

1016
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:38,079
anyway the point is they don't know how

1017
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:39,520
to get back to the original source so

1018
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:41,040
there's so many tidbits floating out

1019
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:42,480
there right

1020
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:44,079
it also you know what's interesting

1021
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:46,320
about medical medium information getting

1022
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:48,720
out there like just say celery juice

1023
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:50,640
people will be drinking celery juice

1024
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:52,160
and the celery juice will be keeping

1025
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,320
them level

1026
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:55,839
while they're doing all this bad stuff

1027
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:57,359
and trendy stuff that's hurting their

1028
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:58,800
body but they don't know what the celery

1029
00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:01,040
juice is keeping the bad stuff from

1030
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:02,720
harming them so much so they're taking

1031
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:05,359
all this other stuff that's bad for them

1032
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:06,960
like pearl powder a bad collagen a bad

1033
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:09,200
this about that they're hurting their

1034
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:11,119
guts and their body

1035
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:13,040
and then the celery juices actually

1036
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:14,640
keeping them afloat allowing them to

1037
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:16,000
hurt themselves with the other stuff

1038
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,520
it's like crazy it's like you go to

1039
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,680
practitioners like oh good you're

1040
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:21,440
drinking celery juice oh great i hear

1041
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:23,280
it's good for you yeah yeah you can keep

1042
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:25,440
that going but here keep up the my

1043
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:28,079
collagen keep up my pearl powder keep up

1044
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:30,079
my fulvic minerals keep up my shilajit

keep up my activated charcoal keep up my

1046
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:34,240
bentonite clay keep up my meanwhile

1047
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,839
you're tearing your guts apart to shreds

1048
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:37,920
you're actually you're actually worse

1049
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:39,599
than conditions but the celery juice is

1050
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,920
keeping you so you kind of don't know it

1051
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:42,880
so it's allowing unfortunately when you

1052
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:45,200
don't know where the source of

1053
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,640
information comes from it allows

1054
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,160
people to just

1055
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:50,880
sell all their garbage to people and

1056
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:53,280
keep them from getting so sick so fast

1057
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:55,440
celery just keeps kind of hides what the

1058
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:58,400
other stuff is doing to them they won't

1059
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:00,240

i'm looking in here there's ayahuasca

1176
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:17,599
recovery because so many people get

1177
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:20,160
brain damaged from ayahuasca in small

1178
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:22,960
dosages too micro dosing ayahuasca and

1179
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:25,200
their brains get totally burnt fried

1180
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:27,680
and like 10 years later they're like

1181
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:29,200
they're just one big fog

1182
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:31,040
and they're just bumping in the walls

1183
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,240
the saddest thing i ever see out there

1184
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:34,240
right

1185
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:36,560
but yet this shaman did it for me and he

1186
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:38,240
was the best shaman in the world and i

1187
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:40,560
get it i'm sure there's some cool

1188
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:42,720
shamans out there and nice people

1189
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:44,880
but dude you just burnt up all your

1190
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:46,720
brain cells

1191
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:48,240
anyway i'm just saying it's really tough

1192
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:50,160
a lot of people need recovery from

1193
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:51,920
ayahuasca so i have it here i'm not

1194
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:53,839
saying don't do it or do or do whatever

1195
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:57,599
you want i'm just saying that

1196
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:59,440
that that recovery protocol is in here

1197
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:03,680
but what's amazing is

1198
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:05,520
there's a thorough information into

1199
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:07,359

1200
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:09,599
like how it works

1201
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:12,880
so when you actually consume it what

1202
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:15,119
happens inside the brain

1203
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:17,680
that is in the micro dosing chapter when

1204
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:20,640

1205
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:22,640

are the books that always said everyone

1423
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:25,760
is different in different ways like

1424
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:28,000
they're different because of what's

1425
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:30,240
poisoned them what kind of metals they

1426
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,920
have everybody has different viruses

1427
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:33,119
everybody has different chemicals

1428
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:35,280
everybody has different emotional

1429
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:37,359
experiences that's what makes everybody

1430
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:39,200
different

1431
00:50:37,359 --> 00:50:40,960
and i talk about that and that's how you

1432
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:42,480
heal when you know why you're different

1433
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:44,079
why you're sick and sickness is

1434
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:46,240
different than someone else's sick in

1435
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:47,680
sickness is different and that's how you

1436
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:49,119
can customize your protocol that you

1437
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:50,720

1438
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:53,720

1440
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:59,040
