[681.40 - 684.92] actually haven't been to Cafe Gratitude
[683.00 - 687.48] in a minute but when I found out mm was
[684.92 - 689.76] coming here I was like need to be here

[689.76 - 694.64] huge blessing to be with to meet him

[707.32 - 711.96] most excited for well I'm obviously
[710.04 - 715.16] excited to have like a more intimate
[711.96 - 717.40] gathering with mm I went to the event in
[715.16 - 719.24] Culver City back in June and that was
[717.40 - 721.16] enormous there was thousands of people
[719.24 - 723.24] so I'm stoked that it's more intimate
[721.16 - 724.64] with the food right because whenever I
[723.24 - 726.36] go to a restaurant I'm like hi do you
[724.64 - 728.08] cook with canola oil and I can't have
[726.36 - 730.24] any eggs or dairy and they're like why
[728.08 - 732.40] are you even here so when I'm you know
[730.24 - 734.64] in Cafe Gratitude it's like I'm able to
[732.40 - 736.36] actually eat the food and and know that
[734.64 - 739.16] it's healing and it's also going to be
[736.36 - 740.84] delicious yes healing delicious and
[739.16 - 743.24] surrounded by such a beautiful Community
[740.84 - 747.04] yes absolutely how did you discover the
[743.24 - 749.52] medical medium information so uh in 2019
[747.04 - 752.12] I was super sick of the acne that
[749.52 - 754.88] covered my face I had like very painful
[752.12 - 758.76] cystic acne and a lot of discoloration
[754.88 - 760.72] on my skin and I tried everything and I
[758.76 - 763.60] met with a you know like a medical
[760.72 - 765.20] medium coach that I found off Instagram
[763.60 - 766.68] and so she's like girlfriend you need to
[765.20 - 769.00] get off eggs you need to get off Dairy
[766.68 - 771.64] and gluten like that was my whole diet
[769.00 - 775.20] and So within like the first night I
[771.64 - 777.64] said let's do it and so on July 9th of
[775.20 - 779.76] 2019 I was like let's go and it was
[777.64 - 782.24] celery juice morning cleanse and I never
[779.76 - 785.28] looked back and my skin healed it took
[782.24 - 788.28] some time um but the acne is gone the
[785.28 - 790.96] discoloration gone so I'm very very
[788.28 - 794.16] grateful to mm's Spirit of compassion
[790.96 - 797.36] for the healing information that is put
[794.16 - 799.92] out there apart from the skin uh glowing
[797.36 - 801.68] like it is tonight uh what other health
[799.92 - 804.16] benefits did you discover from using
[801.68 - 807.00] medical medium information so there's
[804.16 - 809.68] definitely been a shift in my mood I
[807.00 - 812.40] mean I'm I still have my moments right
[809.68 - 814.76] cuz I'm human but the heavy metal detox
[812.40 - 818.08] smoothie really has helped alleviate
[814.76 - 821.72] symptoms of depression and anxiety and
[818.08 - 824.16] just like negative thoughts uh also
[821.72 - 826.84] there's more of a feeling of being in my
[824.16 - 828.80] skin like I'm at home in my body whereas
[826.84 - 831.88] before there was a sense of like a
[828.80 - 834.00] disassociation so it's been very helpful
[831.88 - 836.60] mentally physically and it's also very
[834.00 - 838.36] much elevated me spiritually because of
[836.60 - 839.80] his focus on the angels and the
[838.36 - 842.48] spiritual r
[839.80 - 844.12] so it's like Mind Body Soul interesting
[842.48 - 845.88] do you have any spiritual lessons that
[844.12 - 846.92] you've learned uh through medical medium
[845.88 - 850.72] information that you'd like to share
[846.92 - 852.96] with us yes spirit is always with you
[850.72 - 854.32] your angels are always with you and if
[852.96 - 857.20] you're ever
[854.32 - 859.36] feeling in a painful moment you can
[857.20 - 861.60] always call upon the Angels you can call
[859.36 - 863.48] upon Spirit you can call upon god and
[861.60 - 866.72] goddess I'm very much about the divine
[863.48 - 868.48] feminine a medical medium has helped me
[866.72 - 870.72] really establish that relationship with
[868.48 - 872.08] the spiritual realm yeah yeah beautiful
[870.72 - 873.64] a lot of people talk about their healing
[872.08 - 875.96] Journey also crossing over and being
[873.64 - 877.72] quite spiritual as well yeah it's it's
[875.96 - 880.84] I've always been a spiritual person but
[877.72 - 885.36] the mm info definitely elevated that to
[880.84 - 888.04] a different dimension so his information
[885.36 - 890.20] about spirituality is very unique and
[888.04 - 892.48] beautiful and pure and it definitely
[890.20 - 893.96] serves the soul do you have a favorite
[892.48 - 894.96] thing about medical medium information
[893.96 - 898.28] that you would like to share with the
[894.96 - 900.88] community watching online I do talk to
[898.28 - 902.72] your angels and drink your celery juice

[910.12 - 914.16] and you'll be good to go what and what
[912.68 - 917.60] profound lessons have you learned from
[914.16 - 920.08] your journey uh healing chronic illness
[917.60 - 922.28] discipline is freedom you know
[920.08 - 924.76] discipline sometimes seems like just
[922.28 - 927.24] such a buzzkill obviously because you
[924.76 - 929.08] have to Institute guidelines for your
[927.24 - 932.16] behaviors and your thoughts but the more
[929.08 - 934.40] that you do it the Freer that you are
[932.16 - 936.24] right because then you're you're warding
[934.40 - 938.40] off all of the things that don't serve
[936.24 - 940.64] you and creating space for what does but
[938.40 - 942.28] it does require discipline you know but
[940.64 - 945.12] that ultimately creates a sense of
[942.28 - 946.60] freedom and peace in the body mind
[945.12 - 948.92] beautiful thank you so much for talking

[1052.92 - 1055.80] family healed any other symptoms or
[1054.52 - 1057.96] conditions using medical medium
[1055.80 - 1060.72] information yes so my mom had a really
[1057.96 - 1063.20] bad stroke in 2017 which left her in the
[1060.72 - 1066.16] ICU for almost 30 days which is
[1063.20 - 1068.04] obviously a huge deal and she had the
[1066.16 - 1069.48] top stroke doctor on the northeast but
[1068.04 - 1071.48] they didn't even know the root cause and
[1069.48 - 1073.28] I would ask all these questions and they
[1071.48 - 1075.72] were actually annoyed of me but it
[1073.28 - 1077.44] wasn't until mm information were like
[1075.72 - 1078.68] wow there is a reason for strokes and
[1077.44 - 1081.40] this is the root cause and this is what
[1078.68 - 1083.24] we we need to do and obviously you know
[1081.40 - 1084.88] she's not perfect with mm but she does
[1083.24 - 1086.56] the morning routine she's on a bunch of
[1084.88 - 1088.36] supplements and she couldn't be stronger
[1086.56 - 1090.12] than ever we didn't know if she was
[1088.36 - 1092.96] going to live it was literally minute by
[1090.12 - 1094.92] minute 30 days in the ICU and she's like
[1092.96 - 1096.56] thriving you wouldn't even know he
[1094.92 - 1098.60] wouldn't even know yeah that's
[1096.56 - 1100.92] incredible that's such an inspiring
[1098.60 - 1102.52] story is your family tuning into the
[1100.92 - 1104.64] live stream at the moment I hope so but
[1102.52 - 1108.48] if not you know they'll watch it later
[1104.64 - 1109.88] yeah hi everyone Hi Mom Dad yep hi yes
[1108.48 - 1111.64] and what about your kids how do they
[1109.88 - 1112.96] enjoy the medical Medan protocol
[1111.64 - 1114.40] sometimes they'll give me problems but
[1112.96 - 1116.04] you know you start off small so my
[1114.40 - 1117.60] 10-year-old now when she was three she
[1116.04 - 1119.32] we gave her a little shot glass of it
[1117.60 - 1123.08] and now she's up to you know like a
[1119.32 - 1125.80] coffee cup size of you know um of the
[1123.08 - 1127.52] celery but I can see their progress as
[1125.80 - 1129.36] well like they're rarely sick and if
[1127.52 - 1131.84] they're sick it's for like 2 days with a
[1129.36 - 1133.80] little cough it's not anything bedridden
[1131.84 - 1135.40] or anything crazy like so many kids have
[1133.80 - 1137.56] these days so it's just a beautiful
[1135.40 - 1139.00] process to live it and to feel it and

[1208.56 - 1213.20] knees I just couldn't I couldn't move
[1211.40 - 1216.40] and so I started going to doctors as you
[1213.20 - 1219.32] know several several doctors and I was
[1216.40 - 1220.72] finally at a cancer doctor on May 17th
[1219.32 - 1222.32] and she said I can't test you for
[1220.72 - 1224.76] anything else I don't know what's wrong
[1222.32 - 1227.36] with you she said I can't find anything
[1224.76 - 1228.84] I said well is it fibromyalgia we're

[1228.84 - 1232.24] want to call it that we can just call it
[1230.68 - 1234.88] that I said you know I said I think that
[1232.24 - 1238.20] I need to find something else that was
[1234.88 - 1240.48] in May and I weighed 97 lbs and in on
[1238.20 - 1241.92] June 16th someone came up to me at my
[1240.48 - 1244.88] job and she said you need to read the
[1241.92 - 1247.04] medical medium I ordered it from Amazon
[1244.88 - 1249.64] read it that weekend on the 17th started
[1247.04 - 1251.24] the celer juice on the 22nd of June and
[1249.64 - 1252.88] it will be three years this year that
[1251.24 - 1255.32] I've been on the medical medium and it
[1252.88 - 1257.80] literally saved my life and it was
[1255.32 - 1259.84] really because for me what it was was
[1257.80 - 1263.32] that they were just taking so much
[1259.84 - 1264.68] blood they took 60 vials in one week so
[1263.32 - 1266.40] they were just taking out my whole
[1264.68 - 1268.72] immune system and I was so I was just
[1266.40 - 1271.76] skin and bones at the time but super
[1268.72 - 1273.60] super grateful yes very grateful that
[1271.76 - 1275.44] you're here and able to feel well enough
[1273.60 - 1277.24] to be here and celebrate and have this
[1275.44 - 1279.44] enjoy this beautiful dinner I'm so
[1277.24 - 1282.04] excited I'm so excited just to say thank
[1279.44 - 1283.76] you really can you talk a little bit uh
[1282.04 - 1285.92] more in depth about the symptoms and
[1283.76 - 1287.56] conditions that that healed from using
[1285.92 - 1289.60] medical medium information you know
[1287.56 - 1291.00] what's interesting I said one time I was
[1289.60 - 1292.24] telling some of my friends that I'm here
[1291.00 - 1293.80] with that I should have written
[1292.24 - 1295.64] everything down that healed because so
[1293.80 - 1298.64] many things went away that I didn't even
[1295.64 - 1299.80] realize were were I you know you get to
[1298.64 - 1301.16] a certain age you don't you just think
[1299.80 - 1302.64] that they're just part of getting old
[1301.16 - 1303.88] but all of a sudden everything starts
[1302.64 - 1305.84] going away and you're going oh my
[1303.88 - 1308.20] goodness they're so my throat was
[1305.84 - 1310.88] closing up at the time but there were
[1308.20 - 1312.88] just and all the joint pain went away
[1310.88 - 1315.92] and then there was just lots of small
[1312.88 - 1318.92] symptoms that just continued to go away
[1315.92 - 1321.16] um stomach issues and so many many
[1318.92 - 1324.36] things I can't even tell you pain in my
[1321.16 - 1326.32] foot pain in my side back pain
[1324.36 - 1328.32] everything just disappeared the longer
[1326.32 - 1330.64] that I've been on it well they may be
[1328.32 - 1332.08] small but those things I feel like we
[1330.64 - 1334.36] kind of tell ourselves oh that's it like
[1332.08 - 1336.44] it's age or we just kind of live with it
[1334.36 - 1338.64] but it's really that's incredible how
[1336.44 - 1339.72] you able to lift those things and I

[1659.44 - 1664.60] healing journey I discovered the medical
[1662.08 - 1667.36] medium information in
[1664.60 - 1668.80] 2017 and um and who did you find out
[1667.36 - 1671.20] from one another or did you meet through
[1668.80 - 1673.68] the community no uh we made a an
[1671.20 - 1677.68] education for mm practitioners in in
[1673.68 - 1682.52] Germany and there we met so yeah sorry
[1677.68 - 1685.84] back to 2017 though absolutely okay um
[1682.52 - 1689.80] and um I started uh right when I found
[1685.84 - 1692.92] the book um and um it was no wonder that
[1689.80 - 1694.96] I found it uh found it because um I was
[1692.92 - 1697.92] suffering more than 35 years for more
[1694.96 - 1700.68] than 35 years and I always was looking
[1697.92 - 1702.76] for for information for help and nobody
[1700.68 - 1705.68] could help me and uh I had this the
[1702.76 - 1709.12] story as the most uh people in the mm
[1705.68 - 1713.80] Community have have that um I tried
[1709.12 - 1715.56] everything and um every every time I was
[1713.80 - 1717.20] at the at the doctor's office they they
[1715.56 - 1719.12] told me that my blood work is perfect
[1717.20 - 1721.72] everything was perfect everything's fine
[1719.12 - 1724.72] so it's just in your head and I knew
[1721.72 - 1728.16] that it wasn't in my head and later on
[1724.72 - 1731.44] when I was in my 40s then uh I started
[1728.16 - 1736.12] getting really diagnosis uh but just
[1731.44 - 1739.76] once with uh cause unknown so the same
[1736.12 - 1743.96] corner and uh
[1739.76 - 1747.20] it went more and more bad and worse and
[1743.96 - 1750.20] uh I had times uh when I really didn't
[1747.20 - 1752.88] want to live anymore because uh I was
[1750.20 - 1756.00] just in pain and uh stiffness and I had
[1752.88 - 1760.00] more than uh 50 symptoms
[1756.00 - 1760.00] symptoms uh I had
[1760.88 - 1767.04] um I was a brain FK fatigue uh and I was
[1764.68 - 1769.68] bad ridden part-time bad ridden I had
[1767.04 - 1773.56] the severe migrain severe constipation
[1769.68 - 1776.32] from my youth uh beginning on and um so
[1773.56 - 1778.72] it was really bad and uh when I found
[1776.32 - 1781.40] this information and I started and I I
[1778.72 - 1783.48] didn't jump in with the whole
[1781.40 - 1787.88] information I just started slowly with
[1783.48 - 1791.56] celery tues and don't eating uh no Foods

[1941.24 - 1948.28] no direct uh uh flight and uh this would
[1945.64 - 1950.88] be unimaginable
[1948.28 - 1951.96] I couldn't imagine this years before met
[1950.88 - 1955.92] Island
[1951.96 - 1956.96] so no no there was no chance no idea
[1955.92 - 1959.04] yeah

[1984.04 - 1989.88] this in this life and it's really great
[1987.76 - 1992.44] yeah because it's in it's very important
[1989.88 - 1996.92] to leave some things out for the first
[1992.44 - 2000.28] year and then you can tighten
[1996.92 - 2001.92] it uh more calm yeah yeah you can more
[2000.28 - 2004.36] calm you know so the first year is
[2001.92 - 2005.56] really important yeah and do you have an
[2004.36 - 2007.00] encouraging message you would like to

[2064.04 - 2068.04] Danielle what's your name Caroline
[2066.24 - 2069.64] Caroline so lovely to meet you where did
[2068.04 - 2072.88] you travel from to be here this evening
[2069.64 - 2074.32] from Berlin Germany wow what a journey
[2072.88 - 2076.16] what was it that made you want to travel
[2074.32 - 2079.80] all the way here to Los Angeles to be
[2076.16 - 2083.28] here and attend this event I think it's
[2079.80 - 2085.56] him medical medium It's s so it's it's
[2083.28 - 2088.08] the spirit about it and the truth behind
[2085.56 - 2090.12] it and I think it's the real truth and
[2088.08 - 2092.72] it's like a banana you know how can you
[2090.12 - 2096.20] describe somebody how a banana tastes if
[2092.72 - 2098.40] you never have eaten one before so this
[2096.20 - 2101.52] is medical medium try it and then you
[2098.40 - 2105.72] know it yes and uh it takes time of
[2101.52 - 2109.64] course it's not um an instant success
[2105.72 - 2113.96] like a pill but um it's coming slowly
[2109.64 - 2116.48] it's going slowly so um good things need
[2113.96 - 2119.24] time and I think it's worth to to give
[2116.48 - 2120.92] the time yes yes yeah well because we're
[2119.24 - 2123.00] here at Cafe Gratitude for the medical
[2120.92 - 2126.08] medium Cafe Gratitude collaboration what
[2123.00 - 2129.96] are you most excited about for this
[2126.08 - 2133.80] evening about seeing Anthony
[2129.96 - 2137.20] life having the possibility to feel his
[2133.80 - 2139.20] energy his vibration to to see all those
[2137.20 - 2141.76] people here which are coming all over
[2139.20 - 2144.92] the world and
[2141.76 - 2146.16] so it's amazing yeah it's incredible
[2144.92 - 2148.40] that so many people have come from all
[2146.16 - 2151.80] over the world to be here what did it
[2148.40 - 2154.68] feel like connecting with people in line
[2151.80 - 2157.64] tonight without words because we are we
[2154.68 - 2159.84] are sharing the same passion we are we
[2157.64 - 2163.44] we are having the same goal and I think
[2159.84 - 2166.12] um it's an it's an uplifting spirit all
[2163.44 - 2169.60] over here and I wish this for the entire
[2166.12 - 2171.52] world and uh this is all I can I can say
[2169.60 - 2174.28] yeah yes and how long have you been
[2171.52 - 2176.64] using medical medium information for oh
[2174.28 - 2178.76] I stumbled over it I'm an Pilatus
[2176.64 - 2180.64] instructor and client of mine just said
[2178.76 - 2184.52] you don't know Anthony William I should
[2180.64 - 2187.68] know and so I uh looked it up on YouTube
[2184.52 - 2189.24] and I was thinking okay wild blueberries
[2187.68 - 2191.48] uhhuh and if you keep it a little bit
[2189.24 - 2193.44] Frozen in your fruit salad it tastes
[2191.48 - 2197.80] better and it's even better I tasted and
[2193.44 - 2201.32] it was so so convincing and this is why
[2197.80 - 2203.48] I started it and I thought I don't need
[2201.32 - 2206.56] it actually because I'm
[2203.48 - 2209.88] healthy but as more I went into it I
[2206.56 - 2213.16] understood that um having symptoms is
[2209.88 - 2215.52] The New Normal exactly been talking
[2213.16 - 2216.80] about that tonight that you know we get
[2215.52 - 2219.00] told we have these aches and pains and
[2216.80 - 2223.12] we think you know it's staging right
[2219.00 - 2227.20] it's just or hormones or yeah you you
[2223.12 - 2229.92] have to take it if you are older or yeah
[2227.20 - 2232.40] not even older even the the the the
[2229.92 - 2235.40] little girls and boys they are suffering
[2232.40 - 2237.96] so much they are having um belly ache
[2235.40 - 2240.56] they are having headache so much often
[2237.96 - 2241.88] they are growing up they are not feeling
[2240.56 - 2245.84] well
[2241.88 - 2249.60] it's in a way totally clear but to the
[2245.84 - 2252.92] others who are not in that spirit yet
[2249.60 - 2255.16] and I wish it's coming soon and more and
[2252.92 - 2255.16] more
[2255.20 - 2259.48] bold it will take time so so you talk
[2258.28 - 2261.68] about some of those things that you just
[2259.48 - 2262.92] thought were normal uh aches and pains
[2261.68 - 2264.52] and things like that can you talk a
[2262.92 - 2266.36] little bit of more about them and what
[2264.52 - 2267.68] things lifted for you as you as you
[2266.36 - 2270.32] started using the medical medium
[2267.68 - 2275.32] information what things healed for you
[2270.32 - 2278.00] um I thought my digestion is perfect and
[2275.32 - 2281.60] then I understood that the
[2278.00 - 2283.76] digestion I had is not the normal for
[2281.60 - 2285.96] example that you have much more action
[2283.76 - 2288.08] in your body and that you can get rid of
[2285.96 - 2291.72] things and you don't have to carry
[2288.08 - 2293.52] things old things just like in life with
[2291.72 - 2296.96] you so
[2293.52 - 2300.00] sorry um but yeah you can you can get
[2296.96 - 2303.24] rid of things which are not good for you
[2300.00 - 2305.72] and so you you feel it you you feel
[2303.24 - 2308.32] lighter you you feel more clarity you
[2305.72 - 2310.88] you understand more things you get
[2308.32 - 2313.12] deeper into the spirituality you can
[2310.88 - 2316.88] talk better to people you understand but
[2313.12 - 2319.84] for in every case uh in in any case is
[2316.88 - 2322.88] it's good to to understand the
[2319.84 - 2325.88] compassion behind it and so that you
[2322.88 - 2329.60] understand we are connected and I think
[2325.88 - 2331.80] this it's not a movement this truth is
[2329.60 - 2334.36] just connecting us we are getting
[2331.80 - 2338.20] rewired reconnected and I
[2334.36 - 2339.84] think this is how we have to go for yes
[2338.20 - 2341.84] reconnecting and I love that you say
[2339.84 - 2343.44] compassion I feel that a lot in the air
[2341.84 - 2346.40] this evening that everyone has that
[2343.44 - 2348.32] compassion for one another yes yes I can
[2346.40 - 2351.28] feel that too because you see you look
[2348.32 - 2353.40] into the eyes and they are shining this
[2351.28 - 2355.92] is there's a spark inside it's like a
[2353.40 - 2358.84] Godly spark you see it finally because
[2355.92 - 2361.08] if you I'm from Berlin here Berlin and
[2358.84 - 2364.16] LA in a way you see the people are in a
[2361.08 - 2366.36] way depressed they are walking like that
[2364.16 - 2368.28] and since I'm teaching posture I can see
[2366.36 - 2371.20] that as well in posture
[2368.28 - 2373.80] and they are having so such a depressed
[2371.20 - 2377.48] posture and if I see there are a in the
[2373.80 - 2379.56] groceries only with chips this is not
[2377.48 - 2381.92] okay today morning I was in the
[2379.56 - 2384.76] groceries and a woman came and her
[2381.92 - 2388.16] breakfast was just pulling on her chips
[2384.76 - 2390.32] back to have this as breakfast so this
[2388.16 - 2394.20] is for me in a way in former times I
[2390.32 - 2396.80] thought okay why not it's not my way but
[2394.20 - 2398.04] now I understand this is a big thing yes
[2396.80 - 2401.00] yeah and what's your favorite thing
[2398.04 - 2405.52] about medical medium information
[2401.00 - 2410.00] H okay do I need to say one you can
[2405.52 - 2413.36] share a couple okay um celery juice y I
[2410.00 - 2416.16] hated it my friend was giving me a
[2413.36 - 2419.04] juicer and the first thing what what was
[2416.16 - 2424.00] coming out was I think a little short
[2419.04 - 2425.28] glass from a big stock of of uh celery
[2424.00 - 2428.44] and it was
[2425.28 - 2430.36] disgusting and I was really
[2428.44 - 2433.20] tempted to to give it up at the F in the
[2430.36 - 2436.52] first day on the first day but I was
[2433.20 - 2440.00] keeping I was I was go I was keeping
[2436.52 - 2442.28] going and um the next is the heavy metal
[2440.00 - 2444.76] detox the the morning routine I think
[2442.28 - 2447.92] this is moving the needle yeah and then
[2444.76 - 2451.80] if you are having if you are in this
[2447.92 - 2454.64] state then it's getting by itself more
[2451.80 - 2456.32] and more deeper MH yeah the morning
[2454.64 - 2457.80] routine is great I feel like it doesn't
[2456.32 - 2459.72] take that much time once you get into a
[2457.80 - 2463.96] rhythm with it it's pretty good exactly
[2459.72 - 2467.00] exactly so I I have to um commit that I
[2463.96 - 2469.60] prepare for 2 days because I'm so busy I
[2467.00 - 2471.28] I have really a lot things to do but
[2469.60 - 2472.80] it's okay so at least I have one day
[2471.28 - 2476.76] fresh and then I have
[2472.80 - 2480.00] 24-hour old celery juice heavy metal

[3589.28 - 3593.88] stuff just I'm just getting kind of
[3592.04 - 3595.48] introduced to all of you why I'm here
[3593.88 - 3598.48] tonight with my friend to listen to what
[3595.48 - 3601.96] you have you tried celer Juice yet I did
[3598.48 - 3603.68] a little bit about a year ago but that's
[3601.96 - 3605.76] amazing
[3603.68 - 3608.16] okay I just found that I got a lot of
[3605.76 - 3610.68] Pock ping from that and sometimes when
[3608.16 - 3613.96] talks that's kind well it's it's pulling
[3610.68 - 3615.96] a lot of stuff out that's why gets a lot
[3613.96 - 3618.56] of stuff out but I'm glad you're
[3615.96 - 3622.24] starting like into stuff yeah I've
[3618.56 - 3624.68] really been on a spiritual PA too and oh
[3622.24 - 3627.00] it's one and the same MH when you're
[3624.68 - 3629.48] doing information from a above it
[3627.00 - 3632.72] becomes just one and the same it's
[3629.48 - 3635.00] spiritual and physical it's not just the
[3632.72 - 3637.60] physical because the information comes
[3635.00 - 3639.08] from a source that's spiritual so then
[3637.60 - 3642.16] all these things happen spiritually
[3639.08 - 3643.52] while you're doing it that's true I do
[3642.16 - 3646.60] was just thinking that too because I was
[3643.52 - 3648.16] really on hor PL lately as I've done a
[3646.60 - 3650.36] lot of you know trying to kind of figure
[3648.16 - 3652.80] out things as I was you know going
[3650.36 - 3654.44] through different physical issues and
[3652.80 - 3656.68] then I came back around to oh maybe I
[3654.44 - 3659.64] should be going back into do that's more
[3656.68 - 3661.32] physically cling and yeah that's amazing
[3659.64 - 3663.48] well thank you for coming this is want
[3661.32 - 3666.96] to get a picture question sure I was
[3663.48 - 3670.52] wondering um Spirit of spirit of
[3666.96 - 3670.52] compassion have anything to say
[3672.20 - 3676.60] to it's okay to forget some certain
[3674.68 - 3679.20] things that you forget like spirit says
[3676.60 - 3683.20] you do forget certain things because you
[3679.20 - 3687.92] have so much going on the memory lapse
[3683.20 - 3692.00] is because you're trying to remember
[3687.92 - 3695.76] everything it's it's you're
[3692.00 - 3698.52] very in a good way you want a counting
[3695.76 - 3700.52] of everything you know what I'm saying
[3698.52 - 3702.24] so you have to it's okay to let some of
[3700.52 - 3704.04] the things go and be like you know what
[3702.24 - 3706.04] I don't have to have full control over
[3704.04 - 3708.60] every little thing I could let some
[3706.04 - 3711.44] things go a little bit and then free
[3708.60 - 3713.38] myself up a littleit okay thank you so
[3711.44 - 3718.63] much thank you

[3735.64 - 3740.56] able to receive and still am receiving

[3740.56 - 3744.44] wonderful so grateful that's wonderful
[3742.64 - 3746.52] and um I've helped a family member
[3744.44 - 3749.44] similar to Cole your friend
[3746.52 - 3750.76] um through an addiction with detoxing
[3749.44 - 3752.92] with the protocols I was using for my
[3750.76 - 3757.12] thyroid somehow addiction is really hard
[3752.92 - 3758.68] and uh I'm I'm asking if I can I want to
[3757.12 - 3760.44] I'm wondering if the supplements and the
[3758.68 - 3763.72] protocols can be put together can they
[3760.44 - 3765.08] be combined to create kind of a
[3763.72 - 3769.20] something that can be put into rehab
[3765.08 - 3770.64] centers and help people um yeah I mean
[3769.20 - 3771.72] there maybe I could talk to some well
[3770.64 - 3774.16] that's well that's the thing I would
[3771.72 - 3776.40] just want to do it right if I do it well
[3774.16 - 3779.08] well I mean you have to like see what
[3776.40 - 3781.20] speaks to you too okay A little goes a
[3779.08 - 3783.64] long way that's what Spirit does say
[3781.20 - 3785.12] keep that in mind even with addiction it
[3783.64 - 3786.24] doesn't have to be the kitchen sink do
[3785.12 - 3787.64] have to be the whole doesn't have to be
[3786.24 - 3789.32] the whole kitchen sink with addiction
[3787.64 - 3791.16] that that's where we have to be careful
[3789.32 - 3794.00] CU my thyroid protocol helped her
[3791.16 - 3795.96] exactly exactly a little goes a long way
[3794.00 - 3798.20] with addiction spirit is just remember
[3795.96 - 3799.88] that so then you can pick and choose and
[3798.20 - 3801.76] be like okay this is going to be okay

[4699.92 - 4706.52] amazing what's Happ no way got you the
[4703.52 - 4709.88] video no way come on
[4706.52 - 4711.92] video no way how are you you like the
[4709.88 - 4713.40] jacket I love it okay cool I like yours
[4711.92 - 4715.24] too thank you okay I do have a question
[4713.40 - 4717.28] good to see I know good to see too how
[4715.24 - 4720.92] much how much of a role does numerology
[4717.28 - 4723.36] play with the cleanses cuz 36 to always
[4720.92 - 4727.40] focus on it that always focus on it
[4723.36 - 4731.20] because um even with numerology because
[4727.40 - 4736.24] of Free Will with human beings with
[4731.20 - 4740.40] angels okay and and um and even with
[4736.24 - 4743.40] animals numbers shift it's not always
[4740.40 - 4746.16] this this absolute perfect number
[4743.40 - 4748.12] situation in the universe and and you
[4746.16 - 4751.52] know in the galaxies and solar systems
[4748.12 - 4753.68] and and Off the Grid on the grid so what
[4751.52 - 4756.76] I'm saying is that um but yes the
[4753.68 - 4758.80] numbers have meaning in the cleanses and
[4756.76 - 4761.52] they're very important and they do have
[4758.80 - 4764.96] meanings because there's when you go
[4761.52 - 4767.36] days on a cleanse yeah um your body is
[4764.96 - 4771.68] clocking those days and that number does
[4767.36 - 4774.00] land on a uh important factor okay when
[4771.68 - 4775.40] when cleansing so the numbers were for
[4774.00 - 4777.44] the cleanses were given from Spirit of
[4775.40 - 4779.16] compassion for a reason so yeah they are
[4777.44 - 4781.92] important but at the same time we can't
[4779.16 - 4784.88] get lost in all numerology because it
[4781.92 - 4788.08] can be a rabbit hole you know for a lot
[4784.88 - 4790.48] of people when it's shifting anyway
[4788.08 - 4791.88] right in many ways just because like I
[4790.48 - 4794.72] was thinking like do we have to
[4791.88 - 4795.92] visualize like with the 369 like is it I
[4794.72 - 4797.68] was trying to figure out like listening
[4795.92 - 4798.60] to your older podcast cuz you were
[4797.68 - 4799.64] talking about how there's three
[4798.60 - 4801.04] quadrants in the liver and there's
[4799.64 - 4803.04] another three another three so I was
[4801.04 - 4806.00] like is it called three that's always
[4803.04 - 4808.80] absolute that's always solid because the
[4806.00 - 4811.44] liver runs on what the liver runs on and
[4808.80 - 4813.44] those numbers really do hold true okay
[4811.44 - 4814.92] so all right you're so awesome what
[4813.44 - 4816.64] you're awesome too is there anything
[4814.92 - 4819.60] that Spirit wants to tell
[4816.64 - 4821.56] me I mean you know you're just always so
[4819.60 - 4823.48] positive and you need just just stay
[4821.56 - 4825.52] like you always stay on that posit
[4823.48 - 4828.16] positive note because honestly you have
[4825.52 - 4831.28] a big bright light and people like
[4828.16 - 4833.04] people get help from you yeah so just
[4831.28 - 4835.68] keep that light going keep it shining
[4833.04 - 4838.00] because it matters because you know
[4835.68 - 4839.48] you're helping people and all of that
[4838.00 - 4841.44] and if you feel down sometimes cuz
[4839.48 - 4843.92] spirit says you do feel down down
[4841.44 - 4846.76] sometimes okay you do get you know just
[4843.92 - 4849.04] um just remember though that like how
[4846.76 - 4851.28] you are affects others because you're
[4849.04 - 4853.04] such a light okay you got to remember
[4851.28 - 4856.64] that so so keep that light strong
[4853.04 - 4856.64] wherever you can okay thank you
[4861.04 - 4864.72] good to see you again okay you're the
[4862.72 - 4867.52] best thank you for all the support it
[4864.72 - 4867.52] means the world
[4872.92 - 4878.80] okay those vanished and so a lot of
[4876.52 - 4881.80] great benefits so far and uh you know
[4878.80 - 4883.76] we're on month nine now and so I just uh
[4881.80 - 4886.40] want to keep going yeah for sure what
[4883.76 - 4889.72] benefits did you know not to be TMI but
[4886.40 - 4892.36] I use the bathroom all the time like
[4889.72 - 4894.08] clockwork and it's all day long and so
[4892.36 - 4895.92] it just shows that I'm cleansing really
[4894.08 - 4897.44] heavily yeah a lot of people talk about
[4895.92 - 4898.76] they didn't realize gut health was bad
[4897.44 - 4901.92] and then they went on this and they were
[4898.76 - 4904.12] like oh that's amazing this just changed
[4901.92 - 4906.04] for me you know for sure and I just have
[4904.12 - 4908.12] like family members like mentioning that
[4906.04 - 4910.16] I have a different like light in my eyes
[4908.12 - 4912.08] and it is very spiritual too so I
[4910.16 - 4914.00] noticed this like the spiritual benefits

[5049.04 - 5053.80] even believe it it's incredible oh wow I
[5052.00 - 5057.48] I I have just a question I got something
[5053.80 - 5060.12] in my mind um about languages um did you
[5057.48 - 5063.12] think it's it's a good thing um to have
[5060.12 - 5064.76] so many languages I was thinking because
[5063.12 - 5066.28] I want to tell you something Jes or
[5064.76 - 5068.68] maybe SOC and I was thinking which
[5066.28 - 5070.88] language it's it's the best language and
[5068.68 - 5073.08] and also struggling sometimes with
[5070.88 - 5075.20] English or something and I was thinking
[5073.08 - 5078.16] is this a good thing so much languages
[5075.20 - 5080.28] on the world there there is it's a good
[5078.16 - 5082.48] thing okay but even though there's all
[5080.28 - 5085.28] these languages it's heart and soul
[5082.48 - 5087.88] still speaks the same you know that's
[5085.28 - 5090.72] that's all that's all tuned in on the
[5087.88 - 5093.96] human soul you know regardless and the
[5090.72 - 5096.36] human soul speaks through the person and
[5093.96 - 5099.08] so regardless of language so the
[5096.36 - 5100.72] barriers are broken by that so you want
[5099.08 - 5103.68] to get a picture yeah of course yes
[5100.72 - 5103.68] thank you so much

[7288.56 - 7292.68] Mongolian spot my daughter has a pretty
[7290.48 - 7295.68] large birth mark and I was wondering if
[7292.68 - 7298.72] has any meaning or if it's due to toxic
[7295.68 - 7301.28] heavy model solo Le birth marks can be
[7298.72 - 7303.48] spiritual too okay spiritual meanings
[7301.28 - 7305.88] behind them and for centuries people

[7309.84 - 7315.40] be both so we're keep that in mind it

[8014.52 - 8019.76] important hey yes of course of course I
[8017.16 - 8022.44] love you oh bless your heart I wanted to
[8019.76 - 8024.28] ask you a quick question about Erp shots
[8022.44 - 8026.20] cuz I know you've said about in the past
[8024.28 - 8028.16] if you inject something in the body that
[8026.20 - 8030.44] it sees it as foreign so if you're
[8028.16 - 8032.16] injecting your own blood in is your body
[8030.44 - 8033.76] going to recognize blood is forign is it
[8032.16 - 8036.84] safe to do is there something more
[8033.76 - 8040.00] effective for Osteo thritis in
[8036.84 - 8041.64] KN well you know it it it all depends
[8040.00 - 8044.52] like how like how long have you been
[8041.64 - 8046.04] doing it um I didn't do it I wanted to
[8044.52 - 8047.68] see what you said about it I'm just
[8046.04 - 8049.88] investigating PP
[8047.68 - 8052.84] shots I think look I mean you got to
[8049.88 - 8054.72] find a good doctor first of all for one
[8052.84 - 8056.76] and then you need to tell that doctor
[8054.72 - 8059.60] those those things and see what your
[8056.76 - 8061.88] doctor says like tell them well I heard
[8059.60 - 8063.68] this and this and this what do you think
[8061.88 - 8066.32] you know challenge challenge your doctor
[8063.68 - 8068.24] to get your doctor to think okay okay
[8066.32 - 8070.44] they had said no it's safe it's no I
[8068.24 - 8072.84] know I know but say those things though
[8070.44 - 8074.72] and see and then go to another one and
[8072.84 - 8076.52] then ask the same thing and you it's
[8074.72 - 8077.68] always good to have a couple of doctors
[8076.52 - 8081.60] is there anything else you recommend
[8077.68 - 8081.60] better for osteoarthritis let's get
[8084.16 - 8089.00] a thank you well keep keep up all the
[8087.16 - 8092.24] good stuff get the assets out you know

[8099.64 - 8108.60] you thank you thanks for coming yes um
[8104.08 - 8111.88] so I I've been uh I'm trying to get off
[8108.60 - 8115.12] ssris for 12 months I tried I I weaned
[8111.88 - 8118.80] myself off successfully but crashed with
[8115.12 - 8120.80] panic attacks depression crying anger
[8118.80 - 8123.76] and I just 12 months later I I went back
[8120.80 - 8126.24] on and I'm trying to get off uh what do
[8123.76 - 8128.20] I do well I axle specific are you doing
[8126.24 - 8130.36] all these other things to counter it I I
[8128.20 - 8132.24] was seeing uh a nutritionist I was
[8130.36 - 8133.24] trying supplements and it wasn't working
[8132.24 - 8136.08] you're looking at the medical meeting
[8133.24 - 8138.40] books and dig in there and and look at
[8136.08 - 8140.96] things to counter okay you like things
[8138.40 - 8141.96] that you wouldn't expect uh but but but
[8140.96 - 8143.88] that's what you have to do you have to
[8141.96 - 8146.08] counter it so when you come off you're
[8143.88 - 8148.76] in a better place right okay there
[8146.08 - 8152.92] there's information in there okay okay
[8148.76 - 8152.92] all right let's get a picture all right
[8160.08 - 8165.88] yeah and it doesn't mean it's in the SSR
[8162.68 - 8168.12] I think you just just other brain brain
[8165.88 - 8171.52] there's so much brain information so
[8168.12 - 8173.32] many brain protocols just look at what
[8171.52 - 8176.00] you want to do in there see what comes
[8173.32 - 8177.56] natural but counter okay that's how you
[8176.00 - 8179.12] have to do you can't just go off that
[8177.56 - 8180.76] and then you're not countering it yeah
[8179.12 - 8182.92] yeah get some good Fe thank you thank

[8826.68 - 8832.36] many times okay okay there's information
[8829.36 - 8834.68] about the r canals on those and the
[8832.36 - 8838.48] other thing is about
[8834.68 - 8841.04] V do you have a dentist you like what do
[8838.48 - 8843.28] you have a dentist you like or you
[8841.04 - 8845.16] yeah that's important half of them done
[8843.28 - 8848.32] they saying it has to come
[8845.16 - 8849.60] out they're saying it has to come out
[8848.32 - 8851.80] the dentist
[8849.60 - 8854.16] yes different dentists say different
[8851.80 - 8856.20] things yeah it's very
[8854.16 - 8858.36] difficult let's get a picture let's get
[8856.20 - 8858.36] a

[8877.24 - 8882.84] so you know always use that as as a
[8880.64 - 8884.96] benchmark you know like a
[8882.84 - 8886.92] benchmark what you went through in your
[8884.96 - 8889.20] past dental things that's a spirit says
[8886.92 - 8891.84] use that as a benchmark when you're
[8889.20 - 8894.00] talking to your dentist about that okay
[8891.84 - 8896.68] you had very bad
[8894.00 - 8901.72] experiences you you got to use that to
[8896.68 - 8901.72] to weigh that out okay

[8964.12 - 8969.44] saying that every time you get stopped
[8967.20 - 8972.28] from doing something cuz that's your
[8969.44 - 8973.92] greatest Nemesis spirit says like when
[8972.28 - 8976.24] you get stopped from doing something
[8973.92 - 8979.52] realize you can alter and go another
[8976.24 - 8981.96] direction to go around it okay okay

[9344.80 - 9349.16] remember that okay that's important
[9346.60 - 9350.64] because when we're healing we sometimes
[9349.16 - 9352.80] can feel like we get kicked down a
[9350.64 - 9354.08] little bit and then we're swimming in

[9489.40 - 9495.84] only one kidney and um I wanted to make
[9493.04 - 9498.40] sure that I'm not doing anything with my
[9495.84 - 9501.20] morning sometime I have to drink all my
[9498.40 - 9503.52] morning stuff really fast and I just
[9501.20 - 9506.08] don't know if I'm doing a little too
[9503.52 - 9508.88] much sometimes I want to make sure my
[9506.08 - 9511.76] kidney the one is taken care of because
[9508.88 - 9511.76] I don't want to take my
[9512.16 - 9516.76] husband remember I mean I talked about
[9514.44 - 9519.36] this before with kidneys way too much
[9516.76 - 9521.32] protein is the bigger problem no no I
[9519.36 - 9524.28] know but you know that and that's good
[9521.32 - 9527.12] okay that alone is critical always
[9524.28 - 9530.08] remember that that alone is critical so
[9527.12 - 9532.68] um and then always always keep things on
[9530.08 - 9537.12] the Lighter Side that's all always you
[9532.68 - 9540.12] know always um don't overfill the
[9537.12 - 9541.68] tank okay cuz I do that sometimes you do
[9540.12 - 9544.68] that sometimes just don't overfill the
[9541.68 - 9546.52] tank it's hard it's hard to not and if
[9544.68 - 9548.68] you do you do if you do you do don't
[9546.52 - 9550.76] beat yourself up I'm just saying just

[10287.48 - 10292.40] then it need me to have a seizure and
[10290.52 - 10295.72] sometimes I get to control it and
[10292.40 - 10297.52] sometimes I'm not able to and uh it's
[10295.72 - 10299.12] really affecting my life and I've been
[10297.52 - 10301.24] following how long you been how long
[10299.12 - 10303.68] have you been doing the hmd and all that
[10301.24 - 10306.52] for 3 years I've been doing that and I

[10323.72 - 10332.36] it say say look I I the stress is here
[10330.12 - 10336.24] I'm not going to be a part of it in the
[10332.36 - 10338.24] moment okay cuz stress does that's a
[10336.24 - 10341.16] whole another Factor even if it's a
[10338.24 - 10342.96] little bit and I do your uh lemon balm

[14669.52 - 14674.20] gotten through the first few courses of
[14671.40 - 14677.12] the food you're up to the pizzas what
[14674.20 - 14679.64] has been the highlight for you so far
[14677.12 - 14682.40] foodwise I love all of it it's really
[14679.64 - 14684.16] really hard to choose I don't eat grains
[14682.40 - 14686.24] so it's a big deal for me to have the
[14684.16 - 14689.20] crust and I picked the rice off the
[14686.24 - 14691.72] sushi but um I had the sushi last year
[14689.20 - 14696.44] and it did the grain St sit well with me
[14691.72 - 14697.64] I loved it so I'm enjoying all of them I
[14696.44 - 14699.36] don't I don't know I'm having trouble
[14697.64 - 14701.32] picking a favorite so that tells you
[14699.36 - 14702.80] everything I think yeah it's hard to
[14701.32 - 14705.20] pick a favorite when there's so much
[14702.80 - 14706.92] amazing food here what do you think so
[14705.20 - 14708.72] far what has been your best bite of the
[14706.92 - 14711.12] night I would say definitely the pizza
[14708.72 - 14714.20] how could it not be come on I'm never
[14711.12 - 14715.64] going back never going back take me
[14714.20 - 14717.28] through what dish we have here what
[14715.64 - 14718.52] pizza dish we have here what are some of
[14717.28 - 14720.92] the ingredients for people who are
[14718.52 - 14722.16] watching at home well it's funny you
[14720.92 - 14725.16] should
[14722.16 - 14727.36] ask what we have here is a Mediterranean
[14725.16 - 14730.00] putanesca pizza with cherry tomato
[14727.36 - 14734.00] sundried tomato chickpea cheese which
[14730.00 - 14737.04] was outstanding papers basil pesto
[14734.00 - 14739.44] calamada olives preserved lemon arugula
[14737.04 - 14741.76] and herbed hemp seeds that was my
[14739.44 - 14744.60] favorite I have to say it had it all in
[14741.76 - 14747.52] there lots of flavor and good crunch too
[14744.60 - 14749.08] on the crust yeah it was surprising but
[14747.52 - 14751.16] sometimes for some people the pizzza
[14749.08 - 14753.76] it's all about the crust so if it passed
[14751.16 - 14756.12] your test that's amazing really did it's

[15816.32 - 15821.56] ready for it
[15817.92 - 15824.32] because the information is is
[15821.56 - 15826.96] mindblowing Awakening it answers a lot
[15824.32 - 15829.56] of questions all around that people have
[15826.96 - 15831.56] like what is a demon what is an angel is
[15829.56 - 15834.12] an Angel Real so many people don't even
[15831.56 - 15836.20] believe in angels so many people don't
[15834.12 - 15838.56] believe in so many different things but
[15836.20 - 15841.72] that's the project and it's a spiritual
[15838.56 - 15844.44] one but but you got to be ready for it
[15841.72 - 15846.88] the information is is it's a lot to take
[15844.44 - 15849.52] in a lot to digest and it comes from
[15846.88 - 15851.40] above basically what I did was I just I
[15849.52 - 15852.92] asked a lot of questions and a lot of
[15851.40 - 15854.80] questions and
[15852.92 - 15857.96] the information came through and just
[15854.80 - 15860.36] like you know medical medium fashion
[15857.96 - 15863.72] it's it's a lot of
[15860.36 - 15867.64] information and uh and doesn't just make
[15863.72 - 15869.28] sense it's like it is unbelievable so
[15867.64 - 15870.72] yeah yeah you know I was listening to a
[15869.28 - 15873.40] snippet of that last night that you have
[15870.72 - 15874.72] on Instagram and I went as soon as you
[15873.40 - 15876.48] finished I was like wait I need to hear
[15874.72 - 15879.08] more so I went on Spotify and hit the
[15876.48 - 15881.68] pre save yeah okay cool cool yeah I I
[15879.08 - 15884.00] hope I hope a lot of people you got to
[15881.68 - 15885.64] sit down when hear it you got to
[15884.00 - 15888.96] actually be sitting down when you hear
[15885.64 - 15890.76] this information yeah and um I mean the
[15888.96 - 15893.56] medical meme information or the medical
[15890.76 - 15895.00] books but that's what that's what it is
[15893.56 - 15897.12] and it's mixed in with some spiritual
[15895.00 - 15898.88] information about the soul because when
[15897.12 - 15900.44] you're healing the physical body you
[15898.88 - 15902.68] also want to heal the soul there's a
[15900.44 - 15904.64] combination of both and all that but the
[15902.68 - 15908.44] medical medium books they are medical
[15904.64 - 15911.32] books to get people you know out of the
[15908.44 - 15914.64] woods get them into the light of healing
[15911.32 - 15918.52] but this book book this
[15914.64 - 15922.64] audio is a whole another thing this
[15918.52 - 15924.64] isn't just about tools with nature and
[15922.64 - 15928.04] you know and spiritual information about
[15924.64 - 15930.12] the soul it's way beyond that and I
[15928.04 - 15932.28] think people when they hear this they're
[15930.12 - 15933.96] going to be like oh my God and it's
[15932.28 - 15936.44] going to answer a lot of questions yeah
[15933.96 - 15938.16] wow I can't wait how is it possible that
[15936.44 - 15940.08] so many people have healed from
[15938.16 - 15942.36] devastating chronic diseases through
[15940.08 - 15944.40] medical medium most people most people
[15942.36 - 15946.80] around the world there's no modality
[15944.40 - 15949.52] there's no belief system in health
[15946.80 - 15952.72] there's no any of that that can beat
[15949.52 - 15955.32] medical medium information healing the
[15952.72 - 15958.40] most people in the world it just is it
[15955.32 - 15960.44] is just a fact it's just what it is and
[15958.40 - 15962.48] and that's what's so incredible about it
[15960.44 - 15965.04] I I think that also makes it challenging
[15962.48 - 15966.76] because there's jealousy out there and
[15965.04 - 15968.84] there's people out there in the health
[15966.76 - 15972.44] movement that they don't like seeing
[15968.84 - 15975.44] that nobody wants to see something heal
[15972.44 - 15977.32] so many people like meaning people that
[15975.44 - 15979.36] are actually out there in the industry
[15977.32 - 15983.00] people in the industry don't want to see
[15979.36 - 15985.52] millions of people healing from this
[15983.00 - 15987.44] information because it just it just
[15985.52 - 15989.92] really gets under the skin of so many
[15987.44 - 15992.56] people in the industry but it's the most
[15989.92 - 15994.80] people healed hands down around the
[15992.56 - 15997.72] world it's a very special thing it's
[15994.80 - 16000.20] it's it's truly a miracle what has
[15997.72 - 16002.00] happened the information from above and
[16000.20 - 16003.72] people getting their lives back people

[16012.48 - 16018.32] different conditions eczema psoriasis
[16014.48 - 16020.84] and brain fog devastating brain fog and
[16018.32 - 16024.12] depression and anxiety more people

[16234.20 - 16237.84] for these events because people are
[16235.68 - 16240.00] going to be getting another light Blast
[16237.84 - 16242.20] from you tonight but for those who are
[16240.00 - 16243.84] watching who are unfamiliar with it how
[16242.20 - 16246.56] does a light blast work and can you tell
[16243.84 - 16250.48] us about it light blast is something
[16246.56 - 16253.20] that you know it's one of these things
[16250.48 - 16255.60] where I wasn't sure if I could ever
[16253.20 - 16258.28] really live up to what Spirit of
[16255.60 - 16262.28] compassion you know wanted me to do with
[16258.28 - 16264.72] this so I was trained really young and I
[16262.28 - 16268.24] fought for it you know so if there'd be
[16264.72 - 16269.68] a wounded baby bird that I would find
[16268.24 - 16272.20] spirit of compassion would help me get
[16269.68 - 16275.16] light to that bird and and we would
[16272.20 - 16277.84] practice and and try to infuse you know
[16275.16 - 16280.44] turtles that are injured birds that are
[16277.84 - 16283.64] injured with broken wings the light
[16280.44 - 16286.52] blast started really early on right and
[16283.64 - 16289.48] but when I was you know 5 6 7 years old
[16286.52 - 16293.60] 8 years old I never dreamed or thought
[16289.48 - 16295.80] of me doing being here today and doing
[16293.60 - 16297.64] the light blast in here right now like
[16295.80 - 16300.40] at 5 years old like that wouldn't have
[16297.64 - 16303.12] really computed so it's been it's been
[16300.40 - 16305.52] in kind of an elev thing where it
[16303.12 - 16308.24] started where where I was really little
[16305.52 - 16310.48] giving the light blast and then getting
[16308.24 - 16313.88] a little bit older and and offering that
[16310.48 - 16316.24] light blast to people not just animals
[16313.88 - 16318.28] getting really good at what Spirit of
[16316.24 - 16321.92] compassion wants me to do and wanted me
[16318.28 - 16324.76] to do with that light blast and now all
[16321.92 - 16326.44] the you know what it's developed into
[16324.76 - 16327.92] and the decade after decade of doing the
[16326.44 - 16330.28] light Blast for people and to be here
[16327.92 - 16332.48] right now it's very special honestly it
[16330.28 - 16335.64] really is and I never know if I can
[16332.48 - 16338.52] actually you know do it that day or not

[16659.60 - 16662.60] when I've just eaten a whole bunch I'm
[16661.28 - 16665.60] like I'm
[16662.60 - 16668.76] stuffed I'm
[16665.60 - 16673.00] stuffed that's what I like to
[16668.76 - 16675.40] say um when I think about
[16673.00 - 16676.72] it when I think about like where you
[16675.40 - 16679.04] guys have come
[16676.72 - 16681.96] from and where you are
[16679.04 - 16684.48] today it's it's pretty
[16681.96 - 16687.00] mind-blowing how many of you were on
[16684.48 - 16687.00] madress
[16687.52 - 16691.72] island yep so you know what you know
[16689.76 - 16695.88] what it's like you know what it's like
[16691.72 - 16699.04] and you guys outside too right madress
[16695.88 - 16701.80] Island yeah I
[16699.04 - 16704.44] think it it's almost impossible for
[16701.80 - 16706.80] somebody to understand what that is
[16704.44 - 16708.48] unless they've experienced it themselves
[16706.80 - 16711.52] unless they lived it
[16708.48 - 16715.08] themselves it's really difficult to be
[16711.52 - 16717.36] on matress Island and see the world go
[16715.08 - 16718.76] by around you watch the world go by
[16717.36 - 16722.00] around
[16718.76 - 16723.24] you and people not understand really
[16722.00 - 16725.64] what it's like unless they've been in
[16723.24 - 16727.08] your shoes so when I think about anybody
[16725.64 - 16729.52] who's been on mattress Island which
[16727.08 - 16732.44] means you've just been in bed a long
[16729.52 - 16734.40] time bed in bed a lot more you know what
[16732.44 - 16736.56] I mean even if it's just a couple hours
[16734.40 - 16737.92] during the day it's still a lot when you
[16736.56 - 16740.92] see everybody else what they don't need
[16737.92 - 16742.40] to take a nap right you see other people
[16740.92 - 16743.88] out there well they don't need to slow
[16742.40 - 16744.96] down they're up there they're outside
[16743.88 - 16747.80] they're moving and grooving they're
[16744.96 - 16749.68] doing things and then you watch that and
[16747.80 - 16751.16] it's really hard when you've been
[16749.68 - 16754.04] struggling and you've been sick for a
[16751.16 - 16755.80] long long time it makes it really
[16754.04 - 16758.00] difficult makes you feel kind of
[16755.80 - 16761.40] alienated right makes you feel kind of
[16758.00 - 16763.68] like whoa why am I not better how come
[16761.40 - 16766.72] I'm struggling how come I'm
[16763.68 - 16767.68] sick and so mattress isent is is
[16766.72 - 16770.68] something
[16767.68 - 16772.72] that is important to me because it's
[16770.68 - 16774.72] about understanding chronic illness and
[16772.72 - 16777.28] mystery chronic illness and when I think
[16774.72 - 16779.16] about how many of you would not believe
[16777.28 - 16780.64] you would be here today is there a few
[16779.16 - 16781.92] of you guys that wouldn't believe you'd
[16780.64 - 16785.08] be here today
[16781.92 - 16788.08] but you are right you're here right now
[16785.08 - 16790.60] in this moment pressing forward into the
[16788.08 - 16793.16] future you know right on that edge of
[16790.60 - 16795.76] time and you didn't think you'd be here
[16793.16 - 16796.88] but you are and that alone is a big deal
[16795.76 - 16800.48] all on its
[16796.88 - 16803.04] own it's inspiring Beyond
[16800.48 - 16804.72] inspiring I think it's difficult in the
[16803.04 - 16807.20] health World these days and you see it
[16804.72 - 16810.60] out there okay there's a lot going on in
[16807.20 - 16812.88] the health world and I still think till
[16810.60 - 16814.36] this day that chronically ill people
[16812.88 - 16816.16] people with chronic illness people who
[16814.36 - 16818.76] are sick with mysterious symptoms
[16816.16 - 16821.52] conditions are swept under the carpet I
[16818.76 - 16824.16] still believe it's happening I do they
[16821.52 - 16826.64] don't get the respect they need I still
[16824.16 - 16829.28] see that too the respect isn't there and
[16826.64 - 16831.72] it's really really sad we got a world
[16829.28 - 16833.32] where we just don't have some sick
[16831.72 - 16834.96] people we got a world where we have a
[16833.32 - 16836.44] lot of sick people now and they're
[16834.96 - 16837.72] getting sicker and sicker I don't know
[16836.44 - 16839.84] if you guys are seeing that out there
[16837.72 - 16842.32] are you is everybody just healed in the
[16839.84 - 16845.20] world or do you see people getting
[16842.32 - 16847.16] sicker yeah no I know it's it's it's
[16845.20 - 16850.24] crazy when you really think about
[16847.16 - 16852.56] it all the organic food in the world all
[16850.24 - 16855.08] the great stuff going on all the health
[16852.56 - 16856.84] conscious stuff all the meditation
[16855.08 - 16860.20] everything but you see people getting
[16856.84 - 16862.44] sicker out there interesting
[16860.20 - 16864.32] right I think what happens is with
[16862.44 - 16867.36] medical medum information is once you
[16864.32 - 16869.20] find it you realize you're home you know
[16867.36 - 16870.21] what I mean did you guys get to that
[16869.20 - 16871.44] point
[16870.21 - 16874.08] [Music]
[16871.44 - 16875.88] once you
[16874.08 - 16878.28] right
[16875.88 - 16880.04] y once you find the medical meme
[16878.28 - 16882.52] information you're like home you you
[16880.04 - 16884.40] know it makes sense you know it's the
[16882.52 - 16886.44] real thing you just know it cuz you
[16884.40 - 16888.72] tried everything you've been there You'
[16886.44 - 16890.16] done that you're seasoned you know and
[16888.72 - 16892.52] that's the other thing the medical medum
[16890.16 - 16895.28] community is the most seasoned Community
[16892.52 - 16897.16] there is it's the most seasoned you know
[16895.28 - 16900.16] group of people that have been there and
[16897.16 - 16901.96] done that and tried everything and what
[16900.16 - 16904.72] I've noticed about people in the medical
[16901.96 - 16909.00] medium Community is they're seers they
[16904.72 - 16911.48] see the broken glass out there they see
[16909.00 - 16913.16] right the live wires hanging off the
[16911.48 - 16916.76] telephone poles that you're not supposed
[16913.16 - 16918.44] to touch they see all the potholes now
[16916.76 - 16920.08] you know what I mean you stepped in
[16918.44 - 16923.36] enough of them throughout your life
[16920.08 - 16926.32] right and now you become this like Wise
[16923.36 - 16928.96] Wise soul that sees things and you see
[16926.32 - 16932.16] it clear that's the difference with the
[16928.96 - 16935.72] medical M Community is you eyes become
[16932.16 - 16937.80] spiritually empowered and can see things
[16935.72 - 16940.04] and that is mind-blowing all on its own
[16937.80 - 16942.96] I've watched that all through the years
[16940.04 - 16946.60] through the decades really I've seen it
[16942.96 - 16949.28] myself where now you guys are seers
[16946.60 - 16951.28] that's what it comes down to you see the
[16949.28 - 16953.40] trouble you see what's going on in the
[16951.28 - 16955.36] health movement you see all of it I know
[16953.40 - 16957.84] everybody wants a Magic Bullet I just
[16955.36 - 16961.88] mentioned it out there for a minute when
[16957.84 - 16964.56] I was talking people want a Magic Bullet
[16961.88 - 16967.64] but does it work like that is there just
[16964.56 - 16970.28] one trendy Magic Bullet that fixes
[16967.64 - 16972.76] everything right people are looking for
[16970.28 - 16975.60] it out there they want that one magic
[16972.76 - 16978.36] pill they want that collagen powder did

[16978.36 - 16983.52] guys do the collagen thing or is it my
[16980.80 - 16985.04] imagination did you try that years ago
[16983.52 - 16987.12] did you guys get sucked into all the
[16985.04 - 16990.28] fish oil stuff what was that did you do
[16987.12 - 16991.88] the fish oil stuff right you you just
[16990.28 - 16994.00] thought you were supposed you needed to
[16991.88 - 16996.88] shove all that fish oil capsule stuff
[16994.00 - 16999.16] down right what about the charcoal did
[16996.88 - 17001.08] you guys try the charcoal stuff you did
[16999.16 - 17002.60] that oh I got to do this charcoal let me
[17001.08 - 17005.68] shove this down it's got to be the
[17002.60 - 17009.00] charcoal that's next
[17005.68 - 17011.60] right it's unbelievable and there's a
[17009.00 - 17013.16] lot there's a lot more stuff out there
[17011.60 - 17015.28] I'm sure you guys Tred did you try the
[17013.16 - 17016.16] ionizer water that that would be the fix
[17015.28 - 17018.84] it
[17016.16 - 17021.16] all the alkaline water that would be the
[17018.84 - 17023.72] fix it all
[17021.16 - 17025.92] it just doesn't work like that you need
[17023.72 - 17027.52] you need things your body really needs
[17025.92 - 17029.40] to heal and it takes me to the next
[17027.52 - 17032.52] thing I want to say is our bodies want
[17029.40 - 17036.16] to heal they do they want to
[17032.52 - 17037.72] heal they just need to get what they
[17036.16 - 17040.76] need to do
[17037.72 - 17042.12] so even if your mind's not there yet
[17040.76 - 17043.52] here's the thing about the medical meme
[17042.12 - 17044.92] Community too many of you guys who've
[17043.52 - 17047.56] been through hell and
[17044.92 - 17050.20] back your spirits were broken at some
[17047.56 - 17052.12] point right were your spirits broken at
[17050.20 - 17052.96] some point
[17052.12 - 17055.92] and
[17052.96 - 17059.08] then you needed to see the healing first
[17055.92 - 17062.48] a little bit right before you were real
[17059.08 - 17064.56] you started realizing wait a minute here
[17062.48 - 17066.28] something inside of you said let me do
[17064.56 - 17068.00] this medical medium information
[17066.28 - 17070.32] something inside of you was like I'm
[17068.00 - 17072.84] going to do this I heard about this one
[17070.32 - 17075.00] person I heard what happened maybe you
[17072.84 - 17077.56] know this book fell in my lap I'm going
[17075.00 - 17079.96] to do some medical medium stuff but you
[17077.56 - 17082.40] were already kind of busted up you had a
[17079.96 - 17084.88] rough go rough road many people in the
[17082.40 - 17088.24] medical medium Community have had that
[17084.88 - 17089.72] but then you see a little bit of healing
[17088.24 - 17093.16] and that's when all of a sudden you're
[17089.72 - 17095.64] like whoa what is this I'm actually
[17093.16 - 17098.76] starting to move the needle something is
[17095.64 - 17101.24] starting to move the needle for me
[17098.76 - 17103.80] something is happening here and then
[17101.24 - 17107.12] then something just lights up inside
[17103.80 - 17108.96] your soul gets boom a boost and it
[17107.12 - 17110.64] starts to awaken and you're like you
[17108.96 - 17113.12] know what I'm on the right path I'm on
[17110.64 - 17114.56] the right path and then you run into all
[17113.12 - 17117.88] this
[17114.56 - 17119.60] crap all this crap for it you're doing
[17117.88 - 17121.80] your juicing you're taking care of
[17119.60 - 17123.68] yourself you're doing your mono eating
[17121.80 - 17127.16] you're doing your 369 you're doing your
[17123.68 - 17131.20] 28 day cleanse you're doing the things
[17127.16 - 17133.76] you need and you're getting like what
[17131.20 - 17136.00] confrontation many people have gotten
[17133.76 - 17137.92] confrontation oh you're doing that again
[17136.00 - 17142.36] you're doing this again just go to the
[17137.92 - 17145.64] doctor I've been to the doctor
[17142.36 - 17145.64] how many you guys been to
[17148.96 - 17153.76] doctors and I think that's a massive
[17151.28 - 17156.96] misconception all on its own it's like
[17153.76 - 17159.64] people think a sick person just didn't
[17156.96 - 17162.12] get to the doctor yet a person who isn't
[17159.64 - 17164.52] sick yet just thinks the sick person
[17162.12 - 17166.92] just didn't get to the doctor
[17164.52 - 17170.24] yet and that's something I've seen over
[17166.92 - 17172.04] the years it's like get to a doctor you
[17170.24 - 17174.08] should just go to a doctor get fixed
[17172.04 - 17176.12] come on we need doctors there's some
[17174.08 - 17178.76] great doctors out there but you know the
[17176.12 - 17181.44] world just doesn't always work like that
[17178.76 - 17183.32] it's not black and white when you got
[17181.44 - 17184.32] symptoms and conditions and you haven't
[17183.32 - 17186.76] been
[17184.32 - 17190.80] well there's all these different gray
[17186.76 - 17193.44] areas and gray zones and nuances and
[17190.80 - 17196.12] details and that's another thing too
[17193.44 - 17198.72] being heard with your symptoms when you
[17196.12 - 17200.44] have a lot of symptoms how many of you
[17198.72 - 17202.08] have had more than one symptom how many
[17200.44 - 17203.28] of you guys had more than one symptom

[17421.52 - 17425.68] mem
[17423.20 - 17427.76] community and I really say communities

[17511.24 - 17516.08] in you got a lot to
[17513.92 - 17517.68] learn the thing is is people in the
[17516.08 - 17518.80] medical medium Community they're not
[17517.68 - 17522.36] young
[17518.80 - 17525.12] Souls I mean they're not just just
[17522.36 - 17529.00] here there might be
[17525.12 - 17531.04] one but everybody here really old souls
[17529.00 - 17534.60] though for real like a thous th years
[17531.04 - 17538.08] old 1500 years old 2,000 years old 4,000
[17534.60 - 17540.92] years old yeah 4,000 years old souls
[17538.08 - 17545.32] here I mean I heard from Moc tonight
[17540.92 - 17548.56] like this person's like 4,000 years
[17545.32 - 17549.64] old and I'm like well what about me what
[17548.56 - 17554.44] about
[17549.64 - 17558.76] me what I'm just 300 years now
[17554.44 - 17562.24] what oh why did you pick me then because
[17558.76 - 17565.20] you can handle it I can
[17562.24 - 17567.60] I don't know about that but seriously
[17565.20 - 17570.40] really really old souls here for real
[17567.60 - 17572.36] though that is no joke and that's true
[17570.40 - 17574.76] and that says a lot all on its own so
[17572.36 - 17577.72] that means that your souls contain and
[17574.76 - 17580.04] harbor life experiences from every
[17577.72 - 17584.24] lifetime it's in there it's locked in
[17580.04 - 17584.24] there and this is another one
[17584.28 - 17589.80] now and it's locking in there now but
[17587.88 - 17591.88] this one's a little different this one's
[17589.80 - 17593.92] about chronic illness this is about
[17591.88 - 17596.68] having to fight your way
[17593.92 - 17598.24] back having to heal after everything
[17596.68 - 17600.88] you've been
[17598.24 - 17603.52] through this one's
[17600.88 - 17606.64] different this is about that emotional
[17603.52 - 17609.28] struggle this is about really really
[17606.64 - 17612.76] perfecting your soul in a different way
[17609.28 - 17617.72] than ever before because sickness
[17612.76 - 17619.80] changes everything it is by far the most
[17617.72 - 17622.00] spiritual Soul growth that could ever
[17619.80 - 17624.36] happen is through sickness and chronic
[17622.00 - 17628.60] mystery illness there's nothing more
[17624.36 - 17630.84] that can be any more powerful for
[17628.60 - 17633.32] perfecting a soul for growing a soul for
[17630.84 - 17636.16] spiritual growth and movement forward
[17633.32 - 17638.84] it's chronic illness it's those symptoms
[17636.16 - 17640.04] that's the big challenge it's different
[17638.84 - 17641.32] when you're getting older and you're
[17640.04 - 17642.64] getting older and then you have a heart
[17641.32 - 17644.88] attack that
[17642.64 - 17646.68] sucks that
[17644.88 - 17647.72] sucks you're getting older you're
[17646.68 - 17649.52] getting older you're getting older you
[17647.72 - 17653.96] get type two diabetes and you you know
[17649.52 - 17655.40] and that sucks it does you're 20 years
[17653.96 - 17658.36] old and you're on mattress Island and
[17655.40 - 17661.28] you're like what the is going on I'm on
[17658.36 - 17663.80] mattress Island I'm 20 years old I'm 22
[17661.28 - 17666.44] years old whoa there a whole different
[17663.80 - 17669.48] thing going on there same thing if
[17666.44 - 17670.68] you're 30 or 32 or 39 it's like whoa
[17669.48 - 17672.28] wait a minute I'm supposed to be living
[17670.68 - 17674.08] my life man I'm supposed to be at the
[17672.28 - 17677.52] best I've ever been I'm supposed to be
[17674.08 - 17677.52] like at the top of my
[17677.84 - 17681.48] game I'm not saying heart attacks are no
[17680.48 - 17685.04] big
[17681.48 - 17687.28] deal like I said they're they're no
[17685.04 - 17689.12] fun but it's different with chronic
[17687.28 - 17691.96] mystery illness and getting it young I'm
[17689.12 - 17695.64] looking at a lot of young people here a
[17691.96 - 17697.28] lot of young people here so think about
[17695.64 - 17699.00] the spiritual growth and the level of
[17697.28 - 17700.28] that spiritual growth and that has to be
[17699.00 - 17703.72] respected and
[17700.28 - 17706.36] appreciated first by you you you're not
[17703.72 - 17708.12] going to like have an ego just because
[17706.36 - 17709.80] you appreciate your spiritual growth
[17708.12 - 17711.40] like it is at this point you're not
[17709.80 - 17714.12] going to be like like egoed out just
[17711.40 - 17715.96] because you appreciate where you are
[17714.12 - 17718.32] with your healing and what you've been
[17715.96 - 17720.44] through you have every right to hold and
[17718.32 - 17723.08] wave that flag that you've been through
[17720.44 - 17725.20] hell and back and healed or you're in
[17723.08 - 17727.24] your healing process too with your
[17725.20 - 17728.76] chronic illness you should be proud of
[17727.24 - 17731.60] that you should be able to wave that
[17728.76 - 17735.88] flag you should never ever think that
[17731.60 - 17735.88] that's not a big deal it is it's
[17736.24 - 17741.40] special I think this world just beats
[17738.52 - 17743.08] people down that's what it does it does
[17741.40 - 17746.32] beats people
[17743.08 - 17747.68] down that's the way it's designed uh on
[17746.32 - 17751.24] a bummer note that's the way it's
[17747.68 - 17753.60] designed it's just is I mean sure
[17751.24 - 17757.20] sure but man you
[17753.60 - 17759.40] guys it's whole another level and that's
[17757.20 - 17761.36] the thing okay as you're coming back
[17759.40 - 17762.68] from your illnesses as you're actually
[17761.36 - 17765.84] healing and you come back from your
[17762.68 - 17768.88] illnesses you guys possess more power
[17765.84 - 17771.48] than you realize you possess an energy
[17768.88 - 17774.72] force more than you
[17771.48 - 17776.64] realize more than somebody who's never
[17774.72 - 17778.56] been hit by anything never had a
[17776.64 - 17780.44] struggle yet in their life maybe they'll
[17778.56 - 17782.64] die of a heart attack when they're 65 or
[17780.44 - 17784.72] something but before then they're just
[17782.64 - 17786.56] skating by skating by and they think
[17784.72 - 17789.68] they got it all down they think they got
[17786.56 - 17792.76] it all down right they do and you feel
[17789.68 - 17794.52] I'm sick I feel weak I I'm not strong I
[17792.76 - 17796.60] feel I'm not I can't do what that

[17796.60 - 17801.12] successful I feel just not right all
[17799.20 - 17803.36] that no it's the opposite it you're the
[17801.12 - 17805.00] strong one you're the one that possesses
[17803.36 - 17806.68] that light and that life force and the
[17805.00 - 17808.08] energy force and that spiritual growth
[17806.68 - 17810.32] like I said you're the one that
[17808.08 - 17811.96] possesses all that not the person who's
[17810.32 - 17814.72] skating through life all fine and

[18805.64 - 18810.76] everything I was an alcoholic for a long
[18808.24 - 18813.12] time because our people were in the
[18810.76 - 18815.12] residential school system I'm PR I'm pre
[18813.12 - 18817.80] First Nations from northern what they
[18815.12 - 18821.16] call Canada and um there was a lot of
[18817.80 - 18824.04] trauma and I have been an alcoholic all
[18821.16 - 18826.76] my life and with the medical medium
[18824.04 - 18830.28] information it actually helped me to get
[18826.76 - 18832.72] rid of the Cravings which was profound
[18830.28 - 18836.20] to me because I didn't know you can
[18832.72 - 18839.24] actually cure yourself which it feels
[18836.20 - 18842.60] amazing like I don't have to suffer
[18839.24 - 18844.92] every day wanting that alcohol I've
[18842.60 - 18847.00] worked so hard to try to find joy in my
[18844.92 - 18848.60] life and there's days where I have it
[18847.00 - 18851.32] and days that I don't but there's more
[18848.60 - 18854.52] days that do have it now then before it
[18851.32 - 18857.28] was also always so hopeless it's just
[18854.52 - 18858.72] incredible very very incredible and so
[18857.28 - 18859.76] powerful I hope that you have a really
[18858.72 - 18860.76] good rest of your night can I give you a
[18859.76 - 18863.96] hug
[18860.76 - 18866.16] yes if I were to pinpoint when I became
[18863.96 - 18868.64] sick it was when I was in seventh grade
[18866.16 - 18871.52] and it was a pretty emotional time in my
[18868.64 - 18873.60] life for the next 20 25 years I went to
[18871.52 - 18876.48] so many different doctors from
[18873.60 - 18878.76] conventional doctors to Natural doctors
[18876.48 - 18880.36] I was kind of like I will try anything I
[18878.76 - 18883.20] heard heard about celery juice and I
[18880.36 - 18885.20] gave it a whirl and I could I felt an
[18883.20 - 18887.64] immediate difference after even like a
[18885.20 - 18889.44] day or two and then after two weeks I
[18887.64 - 18890.76] kept on feeling better and just kept on
[18889.44 - 18893.68] implementing more and more of his
[18890.76 - 18895.20] protocols into my life and 7 years later
[18893.68 - 18897.60] I've been drinking the celery juice in
[18895.20 - 18899.20] the heavy metal detox smoothie I have
[18897.60 - 18902.52] definitely noticed differences in my
[18899.20 - 18905.20] brain and I've reversed about 95% of all
[18902.52 - 18907.92] my chronic illnesses it's made a huge
[18905.20 - 18909.60] difference in my life just in how I show
[18907.92 - 18912.16] up in the world in general
[18909.60 - 18913.72] and it's because I feel better for me
[18912.16 - 18916.64] medical medium information is really
[18913.72 - 18918.68] about empowerment it's about giving you
[18916.64 - 18921.00] the sense of control with your own
[18918.68 - 18923.08] health and healing when I was really
[18921.00 - 18925.80] sick I went to doctors they all told me
[18923.08 - 18926.96] I was fine my blood tests were normal
[18925.80 - 18928.28] they was just like yeah you're just a
[18926.96 - 18929.96] little stressed and in the meantime I
[18928.28 - 18932.20] was like riddled with fatigue and pain
[18929.96 - 18935.28] in my body it's obviously super
[18932.20 - 18937.20] unconventional there's no formal you
[18935.28 - 18939.04] know institutional thing that really
[18937.20 - 18942.96] recognizes medical medium but if you
[18939.04 - 18945.20] want to really heal from something that
[18942.96 - 18947.84] people tell you you can't heal from
[18945.20 - 18949.32] chances are you can and the chances are
[18947.84 - 18952.92] you'll find that information through the
[18949.32 - 18952.92] medical medium and you'll get your life
[18953.16 - 18958.92] back I had um alterative colitis it's an
[18956.96 - 18961.00] inflammation in the gut and you can't do
[18958.92 - 18962.80] anything you don't have energy to do
[18961.00 - 18964.84] things and you can take part in life
[18962.80 - 18967.76] right you cannot do the things you love
[18964.84 - 18970.16] and it's hard I've been plant-based
[18967.76 - 18972.48] before but then I would still get sick
[18970.16 - 18974.52] you know so I when I found Anthony's
[18972.48 - 18976.24] information and his books I realized
[18974.52 - 18979.24] there's so much more specific
[18976.24 - 18981.84] information so many specific tools like
[18979.24 - 18984.60] juices specific smoothies right celery
[18981.84 - 18987.20] juice heavy metal detox smoothie using
[18984.60 - 18988.80] these tools on a daily basis being
[18987.20 - 18992.44] consistent
[18988.80 - 18994.68] and that just yeah made a huge progress
[18992.44 - 18994.68] uh for
[18997.04 - 19001.96] me I had s thus I could barely walk I
[19000.44 - 19004.08] could only walk like two to four steps
[19001.96 - 19006.04] at a time where i' would have to stop it
[19004.08 - 19008.76] was excruciating it would sometimes take
[19006.04 - 19010.24] 10 minutes to get out of bed um I I was
[19008.76 - 19012.96] suicidal now I'm going to get weepy and
[19010.24 - 19015.36] I don't want to but I was cuz the pain
[19012.96 - 19017.92] was was unbearable so anyway I went
[19015.36 - 19019.80] online and I looked up natural ways to
[19017.92 - 19022.72] heal because I refused Pharmaceuticals I
[19019.80 - 19024.48] refused a wheelchair and I stumbled
[19022.72 - 19027.28] across the medical medium I I never
[19024.48 - 19030.52] heard of him before so I now have all
[19027.28 - 19032.72] his books I still eat the way he eats I
[19030.52 - 19035.24] I I took out the oil I haven't gone back
[19032.72 - 19038.44] to oil in 5 years now I'm great I mean
[19035.24 - 19041.00] look at me I walked here and no pain so
[19038.44 - 19043.04] for my journey I'm was really sick as
[19041.00 - 19044.56] Anthony likes to stay on mattress Island
[19043.04 - 19048.04] I was really suffering in a lot of pain
[19044.56 - 19051.20] I had been to 30 plus Specialists with
[19048.04 - 19052.96] what was Ms Crohn's neurological lime I
[19051.20 - 19054.84] can't even tell you I just felt like I
[19052.96 - 19056.56] was trying so many things and I wasn't
[19054.84 - 19058.00] getting the relief that I needed and one
[19056.56 - 19060.48] night I prayed to God and I said God I
[19058.00 - 19063.88] can't I I really can't do this anymore
[19060.48 - 19065.92] take this away from me and he gave me
[19063.88 - 19067.84] like you know a thought he said celery I
[19065.92 - 19069.76] said why does that sound familiar and I
[19067.84 - 19072.48] watched a documentary with lovely
[19069.76 - 19074.36] Anthony and it was heel and I remember
[19072.48 - 19076.56] seeing his face and I thought I wonder
[19074.36 - 19077.92] if he does consultations I didn't need a
[19076.56 - 19081.12] consultations because he wrote those
[19077.92 - 19084.16] lovely books him and so took that time
[19081.12 - 19086.92] to write those Bibles for us so we can
[19084.16 - 19089.20] be our own doctors and bring back you
[19086.92 - 19091.48] know our own Sovereign right as human
[19089.20 - 19093.28] being to be able to be healthy and to be
[19091.48 - 19095.32] able to know and have the answer when I
[19093.28 - 19098.08] first started I kind of Dove right into
[19095.32 - 19100.08] it and did the 28 day cleanse and that
[19098.08 - 19101.96] was amazing you know I had like lupus
[19100.08 - 19104.52] rashes on my face that I used to have to
[19101.96 - 19107.28] spend $300 on creams to try to get rid
[19104.52 - 19109.36] of that went away I think two months
[19107.28 - 19111.56] later was off all the thyroid medication
[19109.36 - 19114.00] had thyroid disease I was off all
[19111.56 - 19116.24] allergy medications I was off all
[19114.00 - 19118.04] medications even the hormones um and
[19116.24 - 19120.24] when I met with the doctors after the
[19118.04 - 19121.80] pandemic there like you're off all your
[19120.24 - 19123.00] medications and you know I was supposed
[19121.80 - 19124.40] to have hysterectomies during that
[19123.00 - 19126.76] period of time I canceled three
[19124.40 - 19127.84] hysterectomies all of that healed and
[19126.76 - 19130.48] they did the blood work and they're
[19127.84 - 19132.36] Blown Away they couldn't believe that my
[19130.48 - 19134.20] blood work was better than when I was
[19132.36 - 19136.80] actually on the medication and they're
[19134.20 - 19140.08] like hey you know how are you doing this
[19136.80 - 19142.12] so it's amazing how much was turned
[19140.08 - 19144.08] around in such a short period of time I
[19142.12 - 19145.88] have a whole list of symptoms I'm still
[19144.08 - 19148.40] working on and everything's getting
[19145.88 - 19152.12] better but I think the main thing that
[19148.40 - 19154.60] heal right away for me was addiction I I
[19152.12 - 19157.76] was heavy on drugs and alcohol and
[19154.60 - 19159.92] smoker and within the first month maybe
[19157.76 - 19162.40] two months I completely all my Cravings
[19159.92 - 19164.48] were gone after I started the protocol
[19162.40 - 19167.16] so I've been able to go back to school
[19164.48 - 19168.76] and now I'm on the path of becoming a
[19167.16 - 19170.72] chemical independency counselor so I
[19168.76 - 19173.64] could help others so it's also helped me
[19170.72 - 19175.96] find purpose and yeah it's
[19173.64 - 19177.84] amazing I was trying to go to the
[19175.96 - 19179.68] previous events I couldn't because I was
[19177.84 - 19182.24] bedridden at the time time I was
[19179.68 - 19184.84] hospitalized again I fell for the fourth
[19182.24 - 19186.80] time it is normal to feel discouraged
[19184.84 - 19189.20] but for the first time I felt a little
[19186.80 - 19191.04] bit more at ease because I had this
[19189.20 - 19193.52] truth in me having this peace in your
[19191.04 - 19196.08] heart is what'll allow you to heal
[19193.52 - 19198.12] freedom from knowing the truth and
[19196.08 - 19200.80] knowing that I wasn't crazy right
[19198.12 - 19202.68] because unfortunately Society has
[19200.80 - 19204.32] brainwashed us to not even know we're
[19202.68 - 19206.24] deceived right and it's like how can you
[19204.32 - 19208.32] heal if you don't know you're in the
[19206.24 - 19210.28] position to be able to heal so it gave
[19208.32 - 19213.00] me such a sense of relief it validated
[19210.28 - 19214.32] all my questions all my Agony and I was
[19213.00 - 19217.68] like you know what for the first time I
[19214.32 - 19219.37] feel heard and I knew it was going to be
[19217.68 - 19222.49] okay from that moment
[19219.37 - 19222.49] [Music]
[19222.72 - 19228.88] on when I first came across his first
[19226.12 - 19232.00] book in July of
[19228.88 - 19234.20] 2016 uh I had already been searching for
[19232.00 - 19236.92] answers for health issues for me and my
[19234.20 - 19238.68] family for almost three decades so when
[19236.92 - 19240.68] I came across that book it was just
[19238.68 - 19245.04] another step in my research to try to
[19240.68 - 19247.60] find answers and so when I opened it up
[19245.04 - 19249.96] I noticed okay there's no bibliography
[19247.60 - 19252.08] there's no footnotes there's no letters
[19249.96 - 19254.68] after his name I read the first chapter
[19252.08 - 19257.40] and saw where he got his information and
[19254.68 - 19260.20] said okay and then read the book it was
[19257.40 - 19262.88] the best medical book I'd ever read and
[19260.20 - 19265.48] it actually gave answers and I just put
[19262.88 - 19268.12] my hands up and said I finally found it
[19265.48 - 19270.68] and now I can stop searching and start
[19268.12 - 19271.96] learning healing and that's what I did
[19270.68 - 19274.80] I've been using the medical medium
[19271.96 - 19277.28] information since about 2019 into of
[19274.80 - 19279.84] 2019 I got the book as a gift for my
[19277.28 - 19281.92] birthday and I read the first page and
[19279.84 - 19284.56] that was it I was sold I knew this is
[19281.92 - 19287.60] truth and I went with it
[19284.56 - 19289.96] and everything has helped me in my life
[19287.60 - 19292.76] physically mentally spiritually the the
[19289.96 - 19296.08] whole thing a lot of depression anxiety
[19292.76 - 19298.00] loss um betrayal stuff like that really
[19296.08 - 19299.60] took me down for a long time and that's
[19298.00 - 19302.24] where all the physcal things started to
[19299.60 - 19304.00] happen gained a lot of weight and uh
[19302.24 - 19306.36] everything just started to fall apart
[19304.00 - 19307.76] when I came across Anthony's information
[19306.36 - 19310.40] that's when it's slowly starting to get
[19307.76 - 19312.12] my health back and everything just start
[19310.40 - 19314.60] to fall into place you know so I've just
[19312.12 - 19316.32] been doing more and more and uh you know

[19321.76 - 19326.40] from the medical Med
[19323.36 - 19329.20] information how much time do you have
[19326.40 - 19330.72] um I struggled with a lot of um chronic
[19329.20 - 19333.76] illness autoimmune disease in my early
[19330.72 - 19336.92] 20s I had developed pots and chronic
[19333.76 - 19338.88] fatigue and sibo and eczema and the list
[19336.92 - 19340.68] can go on I had a lot of neurological
[19338.88 - 19342.72] symptoms and I tried so many different
[19340.68 - 19345.24] things to heal and in 2018 I found
[19342.72 - 19347.00] medical medium information and within 6
[19345.24 - 19348.08] months I was medication free and of
[19347.00 - 19350.96] course my healing Journey has been
[19348.08 - 19352.80] really messy with ups and downs but my
[19350.96 - 19355.20] health has been very good thank God and
[19352.80 - 19357.08] now um I'm pregnant and you know I get
[19355.20 - 19359.68] to do all these things I didn't think my
[19357.08 - 19362.56] body was capable of doing so
[19359.68 - 19365.80] congratulations thank you I had thyroid
[19362.56 - 19367.84] cancer I had my entire thyroid
[19365.80 - 19369.88] removed and have been on thyroid
[19367.84 - 19371.60] medication for a long time and since I
[19369.88 - 19373.52] started medical medium I learned I could
[19371.60 - 19375.44] heal that and I've been regrowing my
[19373.52 - 19377.36] thyroid and slowly lowering my
[19375.44 - 19379.44] medication which my doctors don't
[19377.36 - 19381.12] understand and they keep testing me and
[19379.44 - 19383.28] they're not they don't believe that it's
[19381.12 - 19384.84] happening but it's happening and so
[19383.28 - 19386.68] that's just the beginning right and
[19384.84 - 19389.04] right now I'm healing even deeper parts
[19386.68 - 19391.00] of me and healing my soul
[19389.04 - 19392.92] I started when I was nine and I had
[19391.00 - 19395.64] something called complex regional pain
[19392.92 - 19398.04] syndrome and I couldn't walk and um that
[19395.64 - 19400.60] went on for a long time in my life and I
[19398.04 - 19403.00] would go in and out a remission and it
[19400.60 - 19406.04] was chronic chronic pain deep chronic
[19403.00 - 19409.60] pain I have been on mattress Island a
[19406.04 - 19411.68] few times in my life but here I am I
[19409.60 - 19415.64] feel better than I when I ever did like
[19411.68 - 19419.32] in my 20s I mean this is phenomenal I
[19415.64 - 19422.08] have been to pain clinics and and I've
[19419.32 - 19425.12] been up and down the road with doctors
[19422.08 - 19428.20] and needles in my spine and all kinds of
[19425.12 - 19431.84] everything nothing nothing nothing
[19428.20 - 19434.52] worked till I found this information
[19431.84 - 19438.44] medical medium information and as soon
[19434.52 - 19440.45] as I read the first paragraph I knew
[19438.44 - 19443.36] that this was the
[19440.45 - 19446.32] [Music]
[19443.36 - 19448.60] answer I found uh Anthony's work about 8
[19446.32 - 19450.20] and 1 half years ago I had a long list
[19448.60 - 19452.92] of symptoms and things I've been dealing
[19450.20 - 19455.04] with for over 30 years I'm a healthcare
[19452.92 - 19456.88] practitioner I've been doing so many
[19455.04 - 19459.16] things that it either helped me to a
[19456.88 - 19460.84] certain degree or not helped at all as
[19459.16 - 19462.72] soon as I found this work and delved
[19460.84 - 19464.88] into it and started applying it I
[19462.72 - 19469.00] haven't looked back I'm 100% in been
[19464.88 - 19471.52] doing it all of it um for the eight half
[19469.00 - 19473.88] years and uh it's literally changed my
[19471.52 - 19475.92] life I know in my heart if I had kept
[19473.88 - 19478.04] going the way I was going which was I'm
[19475.92 - 19479.68] a chiropractor and a nature path so I
[19478.04 - 19481.12] was kind of like a functional medicine
[19479.68 - 19483.36] people now but I've been doing it way
[19481.12 - 19484.84] before it was called functional medicine
[19483.36 - 19487.48] and I just kept hitting a lot of dead
[19484.84 - 19490.08] ends and so not only have I seen

[19853.12 - 19856.68] day I found his information honestly

[19856.68 - 19862.48] knees like praying like please like help
[19859.64 - 19864.80] me like figure something out so like the
[19862.48 - 19866.32] right way to heal would you mind and do
[19864.80 - 19867.56] you feel comfortable opening up about
[19866.32 - 19869.60] some of those symptoms and conditions
[19867.56 - 19873.24] you were dealing with yeah a lot of it
[19869.60 - 19876.16] was from black mold exposure so I moved
[19873.24 - 19879.80] into an apartment that was highly highly
[19876.16 - 19882.28] toxic with black mold and it completely
[19879.80 - 19883.88] changed just changed everything about
[19882.28 - 19886.76] like how my immune system was how my
[19883.88 - 19889.60] skin was so it was like eczema really
[19886.76 - 19893.04] bad eczema just like weird skin
[19889.60 - 19896.04] conditions bad brain fog memory loss
[19893.04 - 19897.52] chronic sinusitis so and it just I've
[19896.04 - 19898.48] never felt that way this it wasn't
[19897.52 - 19900.12] normal
[19898.48 - 19903.28] and I just went on a
[19900.12 - 19905.32] journey you know to figure out how to
[19903.28 - 19908.64] heal naturally cuz I wasn't going to pop
[19905.32 - 19911.28] pills that wasn't in my nature and I
[19908.64 - 19914.20] spent a lot of money put in a lot of
[19911.28 - 19915.72] time and effort and nothing worked until
[19914.20 - 19918.24] I found him and I was like this has to
[19915.72 - 19920.96] work and I and it did everything made
[19918.24 - 19922.56] sense so I just dove in yeah do you have
[19920.96 - 19925.12] an encouraging message you would like to
[19922.56 - 19929.28] share with the community that's watching
[19925.12 - 19930.96] online oh man
[19929.28 - 19935.60] I would like to share I mean this is
[19930.96 - 19935.60] like a loaded question but I would
[19936.20 - 19943.64] say just don't give up I mean every s
[19939.72 - 19945.80] really cliche but just don't give up
[19943.64 - 19947.96] and just dive deeper into the
[19945.80 - 19950.52] information like listen to his older
[19947.96 - 19952.96] podcasts they're extremely extremely
[19950.52 - 19955.76] powerful and I tell that to people that
[19952.96 - 19957.60] I know and that you know they're really
[19955.76 - 19960.08] trying to heal and maybe they hadn't
[19957.60 - 19962.36] been doing it that long and I tell them
[19960.08 - 19964.96] listen to his older podcast literally
[19962.36 - 19966.60] just scroll through all the way down he
[19964.96 - 19969.48] shares so much information like if you
[19966.60 - 19972.72] don't have the energy to like mentally
[19969.48 - 19974.64] focus and read just and to just listen
[19972.72 - 19977.20] listen to the older ones he shares so
[19974.64 - 19979.24] many gems because I found him when we

[19985.96 - 19990.44] yeah cleanse to heal like all we really
[19988.04 - 19993.12] had was his first book the uh thyroid
[19990.44 - 19995.44] healing celery juice one and then the
[19993.12 - 19997.56] living foods but there's so much
[19995.44 - 19999.72] information in the older podcast like
[19997.56 - 20002.96] literally go through so that's what I
[19999.72 - 20004.92] would say and you'll come out on the

[20026.12 - 20030.84] talk to us how are you enjoying the
[20028.36 - 20032.60] evening it was good so far yeah really
[20030.84 - 20035.76] cool like interacting with a lot of like
[20032.60 - 20037.88] high vibrational people you know yeah
[20035.76 - 20040.52] yeah and how did your experience go with
[20037.88 - 20042.52] tonight's light blast it was really
[20040.52 - 20044.68] interesting you know I this was my first
[20042.52 - 20047.44] time doing it so it was very cool just
[20044.68 - 20050.28] to like be in the presence of everyone
[20047.44 - 20052.12] here you know but yeah it was really
[20050.28 - 20054.36] nice was there anything that stood out
[20052.12 - 20055.96] to you this evening with aw's
[20054.36 - 20059.40] lecture
[20055.96 - 20059.40] um I would
[20059.56 - 20063.32] say trying to think of like a specific
[20061.96 - 20065.08] moment I just feel like a lot of
[20063.32 - 20067.48] different things that he said resonated
[20065.08 - 20069.56] with me and so I think I just took like
[20067.48 - 20072.68] different parts and aspects of what he
[20069.56 - 20075.24] said and just took it into my own my own
[20072.68 - 20077.88] being yeah how long have you been using
[20075.24 - 20079.32] the medical medium information for well
[20077.88 - 20082.56] I I learned about it through my mom
[20079.32 - 20084.48] actually and so um I've been using like
[20082.56 - 20087.00] a lot of wild blueberries like that kind
[20084.48 - 20090.60] of stuff um no Dairy I've been cutting
[20087.00 - 20092.24] Dairy out which helped my acne a ton um
[20090.60 - 20094.56] and obviously that could be hormonal
[20092.24 - 20098.08] fluctuations too but I think it just
[20094.56 - 20099.40] helped on top of that yeah that's
[20098.08 - 20101.12] incredible could you talk a little bit
[20099.40 - 20102.68] more about the health issues you were
[20101.12 - 20105.40] dealing with prior to using medical
[20102.68 - 20107.96] medium information um I would just say I
[20105.40 - 20112.48] was a lot more tired more like brain fog
[20107.96 - 20115.68] for sure M yeah um acne mood swings
[20112.48 - 20118.00] really like bad as well but other than
[20115.68 - 20120.40] that that was you know it really helped
[20118.00 - 20122.92] a lot yeah and a lot of that's lifted
[20120.40 - 20125.88] for you you're saying yeah and I feel
[20122.92 - 20129.36] like my energy has vibrated upwards too
[20125.88 - 20130.56] so that's really helpful but yeah yeah a
[20129.36 - 20132.36] lot of people talk about it being a
[20130.56 - 20134.16] healing Journey but also a spiritual one
[20132.36 - 20135.68] did you find that the case as well I
[20134.16 - 20138.44] think it's all together it's like a
[20135.68 - 20140.92] spiritual physical emotional
[20138.44 - 20143.64] everything is just completely worldwind
[20140.92 - 20145.08] upwards you know yeah do you love coming

[20151.72 - 20155.28] people and just like feeling out

[20285.60 - 20293.40] favorite highlights from this evening

[20293.40 - 20297.40] speaks to my heart and speaks to my soul
[20295.80 - 20300.00] because I've just been through so much
[20297.40 - 20302.44] and so I think that was definitely one
[20300.00 - 20304.12] of the highlights to the night just like
[20302.44 - 20307.16] being validated and knowing that you're
[20304.12 - 20308.80] not alone and knowing that
[20307.16 - 20311.64] like

[20372.96 - 20377.80] when you when you see it online yeah I
[20375.40 - 20381.20] felt like at the very end there was just
[20377.80 - 20384.36] this like relief that like released from
[20381.20 - 20388.04] my body and it was really really nice to
[20384.36 - 20390.92] just feel like completely at
[20388.04 - 20392.36] peace yeah that's beautiful do you have
[20390.92 - 20394.74] an encouraging message you would like to
[20392.36 - 20395.92] share with the community that's watching
[20394.74 - 20399.80] [Music]
[20395.92 - 20403.60] online um you go first so um what I want
[20399.80 - 20405.64] to share so there's always always hope
[20403.60 - 20407.68] so it's it doesn't matter in which
[20405.64 - 20410.08] position you are right now or your
[20407.68 - 20412.32] friend you know um and it's doesn't
[20410.08 - 20414.12] matter when the doctors say bad stuff or
[20412.32 - 20417.68] or friends say oh it's not getting
[20414.12 - 20421.44] better it's that's always a point where
[20417.68 - 20423.12] it gets better and where you can heal
[20421.44 - 20425.40] and yeah this is what what I what I want
[20423.12 - 20426.52] to say it's it's a lot of Hope for for
[20425.40 - 20430.92] everyone
[20426.52 - 20435.32] here um I think that's great yeah no
[20430.92 - 20438.36] it's great um I don't know I think uh I
[20435.32 - 20441.44] think you should definitely just
[20438.36 - 20445.04] keep reading the books and um keep
[20441.44 - 20448.64] reading the living words because um I
[20445.04 - 20453.28] think it's easy to Stray From the Path
[20448.64 - 20455.40] and think you are healing all the things
[20453.28 - 20457.32] that you're healing but there's so much
[20455.40 - 20459.72] information to learn and there's so much
[20457.32 - 20464.16] information to know and you can never
[20459.72 - 20465.76] stop growing from from healing and yeah
[20464.16 - 20467.92] I don't know I feel like there's just so
[20465.76 - 20469.92] much to learn so just keep learning
[20467.92 - 20472.08] and I feel like when you go back and
[20469.92 - 20473.92] relist to things people were saying that
[20472.08 - 20476.60] they learn or they get a different
[20473.92 - 20478.24] message from that say podcast when they
[20476.60 - 20480.28] relisten and hear it again a different
[20478.24 - 20482.00] message or you know interpret it a
[20480.28 - 20483.36] different way and I love that like
[20482.00 - 20485.24] you're saying you keep learning and you
[20483.36 - 20486.88] keep growing on this journey yeah
[20485.24 - 20488.60] definitely definitely there's so much
[20486.88 - 20491.00] there's so much and you definitely do
[20488.60 - 20493.72] hear something different every time and
[20491.00 - 20495.68] even Anthony says like keep listening to
[20493.72 - 20497.24] this relisten to it the healing path
[20495.68 - 20501.52] like relist to it listen to it again
[20497.24 - 20502.76] again there's so many gems and um yeah
[20501.52 - 20504.80] you can never you can never stop
[20502.76 - 20506.04] learning so it's really nice what are
[20504.80 - 20509.04] some of the things that you've healed on
[20506.04 - 20512.00] your journey with medical medium
[20509.04 - 20514.76] information um I'm still working on
[20512.00 - 20518.44] healing a lot of things but I would say
[20514.76 - 20520.84] that I've healed um a lot of my
[20518.44 - 20524.88] OCD um chronic
[20520.84 - 20527.48] fatigue I was like basically living in
[20524.88 - 20530.80] on the couch and like in my room for a
[20527.48 - 20533.20] really long time so I have like so much
[20530.80 - 20536.48] more energy now and I can actually hold
[20533.20 - 20539.04] a conversation with people and yeah I've
[20536.48 - 20541.32] healed I healed a lot of emotional
[20539.04 - 20544.12] trauma things that like I didn't even
[20541.32 - 20546.64] think were possible to heal or work
[20544.12 - 20549.04] through um so yeah I'm really really
[20546.64 - 20551.64] grateful for that and excited to see
[20549.04 - 20553.76] like how far I can go with healing yeah
[20551.64 - 20556.08] what's next in your healing journey and
[20553.76 - 20557.60] Tobias you talk a lot about your recipes
[20556.08 - 20559.36] that you like online what are some of
[20557.60 - 20562.76] your favorite medical medium recipes and
[20559.36 - 20565.60] what is this medical medium glow oh the
[20562.76 - 20567.84] so so I think um there's a lot of good
[20565.60 - 20570.08] recipes I have to figure it out how how
[20567.84 - 20572.00] to make the cookies uh the medical
[20570.08 - 20574.08] medium cookies and what is about the
[20572.00 - 20576.60] glow so I think when when you when you
[20574.08 - 20579.08] get on the morning cleanse that means um
[20576.60 - 20581.52] in the morning you start with the lemon
[20579.08 - 20583.72] ginger or honey water then after that
[20581.52 - 20586.32] you get the celery juice and then a
[20583.72 - 20588.92] fresh heavy metal detox smoothie for
[20586.32 - 20590.84] sure for sure you get the glow it it's
[20588.92 - 20593.88] coming it's it's it's it's shining out
[20590.84 - 20598.44] of you so can you give them a famous did
[20593.88 - 20599.48] you now did you so yeah the famous did

[20603.56 - 20608.32] from this to this with this and then I
[20606.40 - 20610.12] say maybe with the mm glow routine or
[20608.32 - 20613.08] something like this this the way how I
[20610.12 - 20615.56] describe the stuff to um get people a
