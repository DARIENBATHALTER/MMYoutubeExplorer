and then what happens is a couple of

338
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:25,440
people be like I had a reading with

339
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:27,540
medical meme this has been happening for

340
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:30,380
years by the way I had a reading with

341
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:30,380
medical medium

342
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:36,300
no

343
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:38,100
he did not

344
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:42,079
so what I'm doing is mashing up these

345
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:42,079
potatoes getting it ready for

346
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:49,139
potato waffle machine

347
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:51,000
says aw I hope you did not hit the

348
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:54,240
turtle

349
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,860
I dare say

350
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:59,160
foreign

351
00:14:55,860 --> 00:15:00,600
I did not hit the turtle I promise I did

352
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:04,620
not hit the turtle

353
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:08,779
I helped Turtles and I saved Turtles

354
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:08,779
but I definitely didn't hit the turtle

355
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,160
what we're talking about marja what

356
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:17,519
marja is talking about we're talking

357
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:20,699
about the video I just released

358
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:23,540
of me releasing the stones early

359
00:15:20,699 --> 00:15:23,540
this morning

360
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:30,800
so we're just mashing these up a little

361
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,800
bit more real quick

362
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:43,399
I think what happens is that

363
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,339
that there's some serious jealous

364
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:49,500
jealous

365
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:51,120
jealous people

366
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:53,040
they're jealous because they see medical

367
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,680
medium out there they're jealous because

368
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:57,899
they see the books out there when you go

369
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:00,899
into like Barnes and Nobles

370
00:15:57,899 --> 00:16:02,579
you go into Barnes and Nobles

371
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:04,699
you see all the medical medium books in

372
00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:04,699
there

373
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:10,199
and Barnes keeps them in there because

374
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:12,420
people love the medical medium books

375
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:13,860
and they people they heal from the

376
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:15,720
medical medium books and then they tell

377
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:18,360
somebody else about it and they say go

378
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:21,959
to Barnes and Noble and people go in to

379
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:24,360
the store and they get the books out of

380
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:27,060
Barnes and Noble right but for haters

381
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:29,220
and naysayers it's really annoying to

382
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:32,160
have to walk into Barnes and Nobles

383
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:33,480
like you know like naysayers do and they

384
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,040
do that they go in there and they go

385
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,779
into the health book Department because

386
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,820
they're all interested in health and

387
00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:40,560
they walk down the aisle and it's shoved

388
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:43,259
right in their face

389
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:45,180
and they hate it and then they think

390
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:46,980
they got all this power and their right

391
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:49,079
their social media channel so they just

392
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:50,759
use it to be like medical medium is

393
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:53,180
terrible medical mediums this medical

394
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:55,199
mediums uh it just eats them up alive

395
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:59,120
that the books are sitting there in

396
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:59,120
Barnes and no for years right

397
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:04,040
okay let's make a waffle

398
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:09,000
and they're so sick of hearing it

399
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:11,419
everywhere edible medium celery juice

400
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,419
whatever

401
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:18,140
so Jeffrey says over there in YouTube I

402
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:21,179
released my Stones today it was a relief

403
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:24,240
frankly to let go of those three

404
00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:27,079
emotions they were released into a

405
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:30,720
fast-moving Mountain Creek

406
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:33,179
that is incredible

407
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,679
you release them in a fast-moving

408
00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:37,799
Mountain Creek

409
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:41,280
I wish I was there I wish I was standing

410
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:43,799
by that Creek with you and I wish I

411
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:46,860
watched the stones go in to that Creek

412
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:50,220
that was rolling along I would love to

413
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:51,840
see that just love to see that Miriam

414
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:55,320
over there on YouTube where can I

415
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:57,660
release them if no rivers around no Pond

416
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:59,760
no Lake no River

417
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:01,080
um no Waterway no beach if you don't

418
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,900
have any of those options you can

419
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:06,299
release them in nature a path a trail

420
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:08,520
toss them into the woods it couldn't be

421
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:11,400
literally on the side of a road Into the

422
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:14,160
Woods back into nature where you just

423
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:16,799
you send them out and they go and

424
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,600
they're in nature getting grounded and

425
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:20,280
regrounded and neutralized we'll talk

426
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:23,160
about that in a little bit Tara Edmonton

427
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:24,200
says nutritionists told me to avoid all

428
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:27,179
fruit

429
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:30,360
nutritionists had all these rules

430
00:18:27,179 --> 00:18:32,340
rolls rolls rolls Ellie Anderson said

431
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:34,080
they told me my son should avoid all

432
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:36,840
sorts of fruits and veggies such as

433
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:38,280
lemons celery and mango thank God I

434
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:40,320
found you very shortly after that

435
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:42,900
because it was so stressful and scary

436
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:45,539
and didn't make sense

437
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:48,000
thank you Allie over there on YouTube

438
00:18:45,539 --> 00:18:51,179
this is the experiences people have out

439
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,380
there and that's says a lot it says a

440
00:18:51,179 --> 00:18:55,320
lot

441
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:58,380
so what you'll find out there okay that

442
00:18:55,320 --> 00:19:02,340
there's a movement a small movement of

443
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:04,440
mm haters that's just let's just let's

444
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:06,960
just call it like it is let's just be

445
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:08,220
you know straight out about it right and

446
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,100
they're trying to use different tactics

447
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:13,260
one of the taxes tactics is

448
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:14,960
um restrictions with medical medium

449
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:18,299
first of all medical meme information

450
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:21,120
can be literally just drinking celery

451
00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:22,919
juice and that's all you do and you eat

452
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,740
whatever you're eating that you want to

453
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:27,900
eat it can also be more than that it can

454
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:29,220
be the morning cleanse then it can be

455
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,559
the next thing that it can be the next

456
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:34,080
thing you can do any you can take your

457
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:35,940
feeling as far as you want to go but the

458
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:38,220
information is there about how to do it

459
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:40,860
but what happens is like the haters

460
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:43,200
they'll be like you know they'll try to

461
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:46,559
spook people out there and they'll say

462
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:49,020
he makes you avoid this medical mediums

463
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:50,880
to you know he too restrictive into this

464
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:52,980
really

465
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,240
because all you have to be is like a

466
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:56,520
pregnant woman and walk into your

467
00:19:54,240 --> 00:20:00,240

organic make sure you're this and just

481
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:28,440
like what what there's a ton of rules oh

00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:30,900
stay away from carbs stay away from this

483
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:32,340
say oh yeah you can have chocolate once

484
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,900
in a while and you can have this once in

485
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:35,640
a while but stay away from this this and

486
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:37,860
here's the crazy thing

487
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:39,900
they don't know why you're sick to begin

488
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:41,700
with well you got all your neurological

489
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:43,919
symptoms why you've been sick for 10

490
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:47,820
years that's what's really funny right

491
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:50,039
and then glycosate right like the whole

492
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:51,840
thing with like

493
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:54,000
um

494
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,200
the whole thing too with pesticides

495
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,360
right

496
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,799
that whole thing too

497
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,919
I've been talking about pesticides for

498
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:04,020
years years years and they'll say avoid

499
00:21:00,919 --> 00:21:06,240
pesticides right

500
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:07,980
avoid pesticides because pesticides have

501
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,860
terrible things in them and look it's

502
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:12,720
out there the whole bit

503
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:14,700
and they'll do that too and it's like

504
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,020
yeah because here we need to avoid

505
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:17,940
pesticides you want to go and drink

506
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:19,320
pesticides do you want to go and drink a

507
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:20,940
whole bunch of pesticides yeah you got

508
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:23,520
to avoid it of course you of course you

509
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:24,720
do unless you just want to live in a

510
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,640
world

511
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,620
where

512
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,600
there's there's words on here you've got

513
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:33,059
to be careful what you said by the way

514
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:34,740
on social I'm letting you guys know

515
00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:36,419
there's some words

516
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:38,940
that are key words

517
00:21:36,419 --> 00:21:41,940
just you don't want to say in Social

518
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:44,340
there's a reason whether it's it's wired

519
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:46,080
in and there's a reason and I got enough

520
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:47,760
I got enough

521
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,960
censorship and everything else through

522
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,760
the roof

523
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,559
so you know what I mean by the pesticide

524
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:55,320
thing and that word that I stopped

525
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:57,780
myself from saying God

526
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:59,640
right you know that word okay that word

527
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:02,520
by the way is uh that's a trigger word

528
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:03,960
on social in the engines anyway the

529
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,580
whole point is

530
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:07,380
is that

531
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:09,840
um they

532
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:12,000
of course I mean you can be somebody

533
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,860
that doesn't avoid anything at all

534
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,179
just eat what you want where are you

535
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:16,799
where are you gonna hear that though

536
00:22:15,179 --> 00:22:19,380
where are you gonna hear that from any

537
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:20,880
reasonable person eat and do everything

538
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:23,280
you want

539
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:27,000
while you're sick

540
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:28,760
while you're sick and nowadays even when

541
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,200
you're not sick people

542
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:32,820
professionals aren't saying do what you

543
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,400
want

544
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:37,200
that's that those days are gone those

545
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:41,460
days are gone they're in the dust

546
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:45,059
they're in the past those days

547
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:47,580
rules rules rules rules everywhere

548
00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:50,159
everywhere everywhere everywhere problem

549
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:52,200
is though can have all the rules but not

550
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:53,820
know what's wrong with the person and

551
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:55,320
why they're really sick and struggling

552
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:56,700
with their autoimmune and every other

553
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:59,039
condition they have

554
00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:00,360
and the thing is with mm info it's

555
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,980
healing people around the world and

556
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:03,840
already has a track record of it because

557
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:06,620
you find out why you're sick and what's

558
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:09,720
wrong and then you find out why there is

559
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:11,159
options choices you can make for this

560
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:13,140
and choices you can make for this and

561
00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:16,440
what direction you want to go

562
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:20,000
it's really quite incredible all right

563
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:20,000
let's get a waffle going here

564
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:27,120
but I mean seriously it's a real real

565
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:29,640
head screw

566
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:32,280
overall the amount of things people are

567
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:35,520
told to avoid

568
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:37,440
I think the worst thing I hear is avoid

569
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:40,140
sugar

570
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,880
and sweets when really it's not the

571
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:43,559
sugar and the sweet I'm not saying it's

572
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:46,140
good to eat a whole bunch of table sugar

573
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:49,020
like you you shouldn't just go and scoff

574
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:50,820
down a bag of table sugar

575
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:52,200
you know like that's something you

576
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:54,299
shouldn't do

577
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:57,059
all right let's let's get a waffle in

578
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:59,700
here let's see what size we have

579
00:23:57,059 --> 00:24:02,960
let's hope that pretty much does it

580
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:02,960
yeah I think we did it

581
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,980
kind of put a little weight on there

582
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:11,340
but I think the carbs and the sugar

583
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:13,559
avoid carbs and sugar without really

584
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:15,059
understanding why and what kind of carbs

585
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:16,980
you're talking about the reason I talk

586
00:24:15,059 --> 00:24:20,580
about it is because once you start

587
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:23,580
healing you get attacked by people

588
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:25,559
they will go out of their way to DM you

589
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:27,900
and comment and convince you not to do

590
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:30,179
medical medium and they use these

591
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:32,159
tactics once you are seasoned enough to

592
00:24:30,179 --> 00:24:34,140
understand what I'm talking about you'll

593
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:36,120
know what they're doing so the goal is

594
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:37,740
to DM people that's what the haters are

595
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:40,940
doing right now they have a full

596
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:40,940
campaign on all the time

597
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:47,640
the goal is to DM you or reach out to

598
00:24:45,419 --> 00:24:49,500
you or put posts out there to confuse

599
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:52,700
people then reach out to them once they

600
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:52,700
comment and be like yeah

601
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:57,299
and it's tactics that that are being

602
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:59,700
used to throw people off of their

603
00:24:57,299 --> 00:25:01,919
healing to throw them off of their game

604
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:04,500
as they're trying to recover

605
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:07,200
seasoned people can pick this off and

606
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:09,120
understand this but unseasoned people

607
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,620
will have to lose another two three

608
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,820
years of their healing process maybe

609
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:13,559
five years of the healing process

610
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:14,820
because they've been thrown in a

611
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:17,820
different direction

612
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:20,280
people's families or friends also do it

613
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:24,980
peer pressure happens all the time

614
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:24,980
because it's no fun to avoid fun Foods

615
00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:29,840
all right so we got some waffles going

616
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:37,760
that was a big waffle so here we go

617
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:37,760
scoop that up

618
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,900
great smell

619
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:44,640
hmm

620
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:46,919
so good

621
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,900
excited

622
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:50,580
I got some cayenne pepper here I can't

623
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:52,679
get enough of my cayenne's out of the

624
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:54,840
garden so I try to find every single

625
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:57,419
excuse to use them I think what I'll do

626
00:25:54,840 --> 00:26:00,480
is I'll put a couple on top I've got

627
00:25:57,419 --> 00:26:02,700
some nectarines here actually my slice

628
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:05,039
some nectarines

629
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:07,559
put those on top of a waffle got maple

630
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:09,179
syrup this is a real simple recipe you

631
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:10,290
can go to town you can do what you want

632
00:26:09,179 --> 00:26:12,720
you can go to town

633
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:15,559
[Music]

634
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,559

635
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:20,360

00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:24,779
so you guys if you just got here this is

637
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:27,480
day seven of the medical meme collecting

638
00:26:24,779 --> 00:26:29,880
Stones meditation Journey

639
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:33,000
I promised you you'll never forget this

640
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:36,200
journey I promise you that you'll never

641
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,200
ever forget it

642
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:40,799
and

643
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,720
this is a very moving day and a very

644
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:44,880
emotional day I've released my Stones

645
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,500
today I hope that you got a chance to

646
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,419
release your Stones I know that many

647
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:49,799
people are waiting probably towards the

648
00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:51,720
end of the day to release their stones

649
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:53,640
and there may be even a few people that

650
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:55,860
probably won't release them they should

651
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:59,340
though it's good to release them today

652
00:26:55,860 --> 00:27:01,620
that would be fantastic

653
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:03,059
Rhonda Johansson says some people just

654
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:07,020
can't handle the truth about

655
00:27:03,059 --> 00:27:10,279
Troublemaker Foods that's true too

656
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:10,279
I think we just lost TT

657
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:16,159
I smell a waffle a delicious waffle

658
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,159
cooking right now

659
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:22,760
so let's talk about Road walks it's

660
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:22,760
something that happens all the time

661
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:26,580
say you're somebody and you're just

662
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:29,520
eating complete just standard European

663
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:31,320
or standard American

664
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:33,000
that's what you do

665
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:36,659
you're raised on standard American

666
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,820
you're raised on standard European

667
00:27:36,659 --> 00:27:42,720
because they're both bad

668
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:45,900
Europeans will tell you they're both bad

669
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:48,900
and you're raised on that standard

670
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:50,760
and then you start getting sick

671
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:52,380
and then you seek help and you go to

672
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:53,760
just a regular doctor and the doctor

673
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:55,679
doesn't care about what you're eating

674
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,059
you might find a doctor that just

675
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:58,679
doesn't care they just want to do work

676
00:27:57,059 --> 00:28:00,059
up check things out they won't even ask

677
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:01,980
you about your diet or anything like

678
00:28:00,059 --> 00:28:04,200
that

679
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:06,480
and they send you on your way maybe they

680
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:07,919
give you a drug or two prescription and

681
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,080
they send you on your way

682
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:12,059
and then

683
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:14,220
you're just not getting better

684
00:28:12,059 --> 00:28:16,020
so you go to another doctor

685
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:19,320
Jenny Jenn says the days of speaking

686
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:21,860
freely and openly are gone bye bye

687
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,860
I agree

688
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:27,900
this waffle is cooking I have the

689
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:29,340
temperature

690
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:31,020
jacked up

691
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:32,400
and then you go to another doctor and

692
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:33,900
another doctor says you know what what

693
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,220
are you doing for Foods because the

694
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:36,659
doctor's more interested in that and

695
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:38,580
you're like hearing it now all of a

696
00:28:36,659 --> 00:28:40,260
sudden you're like stay away from this

697
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:42,419
stay away from sugar stay away from

698
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:47,400
sweets you're starting to hear that it's

699
00:28:42,419 --> 00:28:49,080
a slow slow climb upward to your healing

700
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:52,080
process

701
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:53,580
and even then even if you find a guru

702
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:55,140
somewhere that's telling you what to

703
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:57,059
avoid

704
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:58,919
chances are you won't know the answers

705
00:28:57,059 --> 00:29:00,659
to why you were sick to begin with and

706
00:28:58,919 --> 00:29:02,539
why you're even avoiding everything

707
00:29:00,659 --> 00:29:05,580
you'll just hear the blanket statement

708
00:29:02,539 --> 00:29:07,559
avoid these things because it causes

709
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:09,840
inflammation

710
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:11,640
avoid these things because it's not good

711
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,860
with autoimmune

712
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:15,840
but you're still in the woods and you're

713
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:19,080
still deep in the hole

714
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:21,419
because that's not enough

715
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:23,039
and then you run into a whole bunch of

716
00:29:21,419 --> 00:29:24,960
different things in people along the way

717
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:27,000
this person says tripod map this another

718
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,799
person says right try gaps another

719
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,539
person says boom triggers another person

720
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:33,659
says oh try but let's type another

721
00:29:30,539 --> 00:29:35,520
person says oh try this try that

722
00:29:33,659 --> 00:29:36,360
and you hear it over and over and over

723
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,940
again

724
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:41,159
and then it oscillates

725
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:43,740
and then it's lectins and then it's one

726
00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:45,240
thing after another carbs sugar too much

727
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:48,860
sugar and then you hear it and now

728
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:48,860
you're just in the abyss of hell

729
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:52,860
let's see on IG you are doing the same

730
00:29:51,179 --> 00:29:56,159
thing you are saying they are doing

731
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:58,679
laugh out loud over and over

732
00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:01,559
that's my point thank you for saying

733
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:03,779
that on IG that's my whole point

734
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:06,299
because they're telling me

735
00:30:03,779 --> 00:30:10,440
out there the haters have a campaign

736
00:30:06,299 --> 00:30:12,120
saying that I have restrictions that mm

737
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:14,399
is restrictive and you should be allowed

738
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:16,679
to eat anything you wanted

739
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:17,940
by the way in the same breath they say

740
00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:20,039
that they say check out this

741
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:22,320
nutritionist guy here on social check

742
00:30:20,039 --> 00:30:23,880
out this PhD over here on social check

743
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:26,760
out this guy and when you check them out

744
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:29,510
they're giving you a hundred rules

745
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:30,720
that's my whole point

746
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:32,340
[Music]

747
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:35,840
but here's the best part of the point

748
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:35,840
they don't know why you're sick

749
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:39,600
and the medical medium books tell you

750
00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:42,120
why you're sick and that's why this the

751
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:45,299
street cred and the record is that huge

752
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:48,299
of people healing around the world but

753
00:30:45,299 --> 00:30:50,220
that makes me a dangerous person because

754
00:30:48,299 --> 00:30:52,559
too many people are healing and too many

755
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:54,720
people are finding answers

756
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:57,360
and then you get jealousy and hate in

757
00:30:54,720 --> 00:31:00,059
the competitor world of the natural food

758
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:01,860
movement which is all about marketing

759
00:31:00,059 --> 00:31:04,500
and sales and they don't like medical

760
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:06,659
medium in the way especially when

761
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:08,460
medical medium blows the horn and the

762
00:31:06,659 --> 00:31:11,220
whistle on a whole bunch of things that

763
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:13,740
are really bad for you out there

764
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:15,720
and then I just become this thing that's

765
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:17,820
in the way

766
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:19,980
and that's how it works

767
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:21,899
now let's take a look at this waffle but

768
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:24,659
I'm not quite sure it's done

769
00:31:21,899 --> 00:31:28,039
a couple more minutes

770
00:31:24,659 --> 00:31:28,039
can't wait to make another one

771
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:32,580
medical medium directory has a lot of

772
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:34,080
things that I use check it out

773
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:35,940
in case you're interested in something

774
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:37,870
or whatever

775
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:40,200
I don't own the companies

776
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:43,140
[Music]

777
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:46,559
getting a plate out

778
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:49,640
people are asking questions

779
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:49,640
that's why I said that

780
00:31:51,299 --> 00:31:55,440
lamb tail said on YouTube My Dentist

781
00:31:53,399 --> 00:31:58,020
told me to stop drinking lemon water and

782
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:02,059
I said no laugh out loud he was not

783
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:02,059
happy but I couldn't lie

784
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:08,720
patient

785
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:08,720
Dental patient

786
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:16,100
do not use lemon water

787
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:19,559
because you're going to destroy all your

788
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,500
teeth you know what's going to destroy

789
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:25,100
everybody's teeth vinegar

790
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:25,100
vinegar

791
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:30,659
do you see vinegar anywhere

792
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:32,340
get rid of it

793
00:32:30,659 --> 00:32:34,740
can you still heal and do a little

794
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:37,020
vinegar depends on what's wrong with you

795
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:39,120
because there's a scale

796
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:40,740
like I said you can drink celery just do

797
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:43,320
celery juice your acid reflux is gone

798
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:45,480
you move on with your life fine

799
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:47,039
something else going on you you need to

800
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:49,080
increase you need to bring in other

801
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:51,600
things you got to learn how to become

802
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:53,399
your expert your own expert and you need

803
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:56,399
to know the tools and you can do that

804
00:32:53,399 --> 00:32:58,860
with MN mm info but keep in mind right

805
00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:01,679
if you're worried about teeth drop the

806
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:04,020
vinegar because they will annihilate

807
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:07,020
your teeth over time apple cider vinegar

808
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:09,659
will by the way I pissed off the apple

809
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:14,059
cider vinegar industry really bad in the

810
00:33:09,659 --> 00:33:14,059
last so-called years so many years

811
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:21,659
Duff says on IG everything I've read and

812
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:24,899
listened from you makes absolute sense

813
00:33:21,659 --> 00:33:26,700
and works I'm feeling great trying to

814
00:33:24,899 --> 00:33:28,799
spread the word to those that are

815
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:30,539
willing to listen thank you you are a

816
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:32,279
warrior

817
00:33:30,539 --> 00:33:36,299
you are a warrior because the medical

818
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:37,919
medium Community takes a lot of crap

819
00:33:36,299 --> 00:33:40,380
when they say I'm healing with medical

820
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:41,460
medium then a whole bunch of trolls come

821
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:43,500
in

822
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:46,140
or haters

823
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:48,539
we all have a choice of what we consume

824
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:50,279
over there NRG

825
00:33:48,539 --> 00:33:52,380
so I'm cooking this a little bit longer

826
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:54,299
I let it hit that temperature Where It

827
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:56,580
beeped Boop

828
00:33:54,299 --> 00:34:00,260
Boop letting it cook a little bit longer

829
00:33:56,580 --> 00:34:00,260
I want my Waffle crispy

830
00:34:00,299 --> 00:34:04,519
yeah if we know the truth about things

831
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:11,399
Erie says Anthony can you consider the

832
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:13,500
idea of visiting Sweden I would love to

833
00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:15,359
visit Sweden

834
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:19,560
someday

835
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:22,760
we only have a choice if we know

836
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:22,760
we have a choice

837
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:26,399
we can't make a choice if we don't know

838
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:27,960
the answers

839
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:29,220
we can't make a choice if we don't know

840
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,960
why we're sick

841
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:32,879
we can make a choice but it could be a

842
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,919
wrong choice

843
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:36,720
when we learn why we're sick truly why

844
00:34:34,919 --> 00:34:38,879
we're sick then we can make choices and

845
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:41,599
if we know tools to really help us we

846
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:41,599
can make choices

847
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:47,899
I'm going to make a couple different

848
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,899
waffles

849
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:03,020
thank you for being in my kitchen you

850
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:03,020
guys

851
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:06,440
foreign

852
00:35:06,839 --> 00:35:12,079
I think I'm going to use this platter

853
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:12,079
right here if you guys don't mind

854
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:19,400
put it right here

855
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:19,400
I'm going to make a couple of waffles

856
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:25,400
letting it cook for another minute

857
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,730
okay there we go

858
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:33,329
I think

859
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:33,329
[Music]

860
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:39,359
even says that happened to me 11 years

861
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:41,700
ago at the doctor's office and I had to

862
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:44,160
figure out Health on my own and when

863
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:46,680
vegan but have needed to clean up my

864
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:48,420
diet even more as I got older and your

865
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:51,480
info has saved me and I want to talk

866
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:52,920
about that right now about vegans

867
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:54,780
this is an important piece of

868
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:56,940
information there's vegan and there's

869
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:58,380
medical medium vegan

870
00:35:56,940 --> 00:36:01,260
there's animal based then there's

871
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:03,180
medical medium animal base

872
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:06,960
there's plant-based

873
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:08,820
but there's medical medium plant-based

874
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,740
very important to know entirely

875
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:13,560
different two different things so many

876
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:16,140
people went vegan and stayed sick or got

877
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:18,300
sicker so many people went plant-based

878
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:19,740
and stayed sick and got sicker they

879
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:21,359
still had to learn why they were sick

880
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:23,160
and then all the different tools and

881
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:25,680
options they can apply while being

882
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:28,320
plant-based or vegan

883
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:30,000
The Details Matter Hannah says on

884
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:33,020
YouTube Hannah I always read your

885
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,020
comments on YouTube too

886
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:39,660
so that's an important distinction right

887
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:41,700
there and a critical one at that

888
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:45,560
when someone says well I'm vegan I don't

889
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:45,560
need to do medical medium it's like okay

890
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:51,060
as if all the answers are encompassed

891
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:53,220
and just being vegan

892
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:55,500
you can be vegan and still eat all the

893
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:57,300
wrong things while you're sick because

894
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:59,579
you can still be vegan and not know why

895
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:00,780
you're sick you can still be plant-based

896
00:36:59,579 --> 00:37:01,920
eat all the wrong things while you're

897
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:03,540
sick

898
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,640
and not know why you're sick as your

899
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:07,140
plant-based you can be animal based and

900
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,880
not know why you're sick and eat all the

901
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:11,520
wrong things you can be this really

902
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:14,760
healthy healthy meaning healthy kind of

903
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:17,280
eating animal-based person

904
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:18,300
still be sick get sicker not in a while

905
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:20,700
you're sick

906
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:23,220
you can that's how it works medical meme

907
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:24,780
information isn't about

908
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:26,520
you know

909
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:28,680
I mean it's that's the bottom line

910
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:31,440
Jackie B says before I found NM I was

911
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:34,820
naive vegan so you weren't medical

912
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,820
median vegan right

913
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:39,300
and that's something that people don't

914
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:41,520
understand they Encompass the whole

915
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:44,900
vegan thing and that's it

916
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,900
all right so let's get this out

917
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:55,500
on IG Cosmic Affinity they were trying

918
00:37:52,619 --> 00:37:58,460
to get 12 vials of blood out of me

919
00:37:55,500 --> 00:38:02,520
yesterday and I wouldn't let them do

920
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:05,480
that so I left thanks for the blood draw

921
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:08,400
episode epic episode I think you said

922
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:09,900
yesterday and wouldn't let me do less

923
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,520
that's what it is so I left they

924
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:14,480
wouldn't let you do less

925
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:14,480
well

926
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:24,540
I don't want to put you know put my

927
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:27,540
blood in the waffle right here where my

928
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:28,800
vials of blood right here

929
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:30,300
um

930
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,980
we'll talk about that for a little bit

931
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:33,300
that's another important distinction

932
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:35,579
right there the blood draw information

933
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:36,960
is critical and it sets medical medium

934
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:39,060
information apart from all the other

935
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:41,099
vegan people out there in the world and

936
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:42,599
plant-based authorities or whatever you

937
00:38:41,099 --> 00:38:44,099
call them I'm not against getting your

938
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:45,660
blood drawn I'm about doing small

939
00:38:44,099 --> 00:38:47,220
amounts and I'll talk about that for a

940
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:49,619
second I think it's well deserved

941
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:51,780
deserving

942
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:53,040
I just hope I cook this waffle good

943
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:53,880
enough because

944
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:56,720
um

945
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:56,720
yeah I did

946
00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:01,380
do I drive you guys crazy when I cook in

947
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:03,660
the sense where you're like I could do a

948
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:06,480
better job than medical medium get me in

949
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:09,599
that kitchen medical me

950
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:12,180
he's always up to he's always up to no

951
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:13,380
good when he's cooking

952
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:16,579
okay

953
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:16,579
get another waffle going

954
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:29,300
I'm gonna put it right in the middle

955
00:39:26,339 --> 00:39:29,300
look at this

956
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:34,700
let's get that rolling

957
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:41,700
prime example of the difference between

958
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:44,480
medical medium plant-based and regular

959
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:44,480
plant-based

960
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:49,400
because if your medical medium

961
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,400
plant-based you'll learn

962
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:55,099
that it's critical to be cautious on how

963
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:55,099
much blood is drawn

964
00:39:55,859 --> 00:39:59,579
and you maybe would have heard the

965
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:01,380
podcast or read the Brain book and

966
00:39:59,579 --> 00:40:04,440
learned all about it about

967
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:06,440
getting half files getting asking your

968
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:10,140
doctor for Less blood at one time

969
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:12,180
because you lose your immune system

970
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:14,339
you lose your immune system and you can

971
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:15,900
be plant-based sick

972
00:40:14,339 --> 00:40:18,000
go to your functional medicine doctors

973
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:19,920
that even are fine in baggy bean

974
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,720
plant-based draw too much blood

975
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:23,339
periodically because you're sick and get

976
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:24,660
sick or plant-based and that's the

977
00:40:23,339 --> 00:40:26,339
difference between plant-based

978
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:27,839
non-medical medium plant-based medical

979
00:40:26,339 --> 00:40:29,820
medium

980
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:31,560
that's just one example keep that in

981
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:33,660
mind

982
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:34,980
by the way you guys were day seven of

983
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:36,660
the medical medium collecting Stones

984
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:40,160
meditation Journey

985
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:40,160
and here's what's crazy

986
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:47,040
like insane

987
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:48,599
the sicker you get the more blood they

988
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:50,700
take

989
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:52,680
the sicker you get the more blood they

990
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:55,859
take you think I'm done

991
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:57,839
and the sicker you get again the more

992
00:40:55,859 --> 00:41:00,060
blood they take but the more blood they

993
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:03,599
take and get ready for this

994
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:06,240
you can be death bed sick and they will

995
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:08,660
take even more blood essentially they'll

996
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,660
kill you

997
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:13,560
but ask your doctor what's right for you

998
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:14,820
I'm just saying that's what I recommend

999
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:16,619
friends and family

1000
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:18,480
be cautious about the the amount of

1001
00:41:16,619 --> 00:41:20,760
blood being taken at once find a new

1002
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:23,540
Doctor Who will listen you can advocate

1003
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:23,540
for yourself

1004
00:41:24,839 --> 00:41:31,339
pressing this waffle down a little bit

1005
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:31,339
because I want to just spread that out

1006
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:40,260
yeah

1007
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:42,060
and that's one of the examples right

1008
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:43,740
there which is really important just

1009
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:46,560
like you could be plant-based but

1010
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:49,200
literally fat yourself to death and

1011
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:52,980
throw yourself into pancreatitis you can

1012
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:55,560
be plant-based and be dropping oil

1013
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:57,500
eating too much Nut Butter I'm not

1014
00:41:55,560 --> 00:42:00,000
against Nut Butter I'm not against

1015
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:01,380
avocado that's not it but if you're

1016
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,460
really sick and struggling and you don't

1017
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:04,680
know what's going on and you go

1018
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:06,960
plant-based and now you're just chowing

1019
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:08,640
the cacao and you're chowing all that

1020
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:10,020
cacao butter I'm serious you guys this

1021
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:12,000
is an important topic

1022
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:14,579
and you're you're gobbling down that

1023
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,500
cacao powder and that those cacao nibs

1024
00:42:14,579 --> 00:42:18,240
and all those chocolate bars in your

1025
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:21,300
plant-based

1026
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:23,520
yeah you can still get yourself sick if

1027
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:25,980
you're sick

1028
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:28,619
light heart over on IG says that's what

1029
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:32,300
they did to my grandma with cirrhosis

1030
00:42:28,619 --> 00:42:32,300
bled her to death

1031
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:45,300
reason why I have these vials and this

1032
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:47,940
vial this

1033
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:49,920
big tube of blood because when I was in

1034
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:51,599
I was in the doctor's office and they're

1035
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:53,220
pulling too much out I just grabbed it I

1036
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:55,140
said no you're not that that's it you're

1037
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:57,060
not taking any more I'm going and I went

1038
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:58,500
out the door I put it in my fridge you

1039
00:42:57,060 --> 00:43:00,000
know I'm kidding around I didn't do that

1040
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:03,179
this is ketchup

1041
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,179
[Music]

1042
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:06,319
it's ketchup

1043
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:12,960
so all these things matter so we'll go

1044
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:14,160
into a little bit first I wanna I did

1045
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,300
promise you guys I was going to talk

1046
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,920
about

1047
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:18,420
The Seventh-Day collecting Stones

1048
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:20,520
meditation journey and releasing the

1049
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:23,160
stones I just want to give you this

1050
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:27,300
really important piece that's critical

1051
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:29,460
okay so what these Stones were doing all

1052
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:32,339
week as you were getting that connection

1053
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:35,339
with your Stones was absorbing

1054
00:43:32,339 --> 00:43:37,920
Old Wounds old hardships all kinds of

1055
00:43:35,339 --> 00:43:40,260
different scars on our soul

1056
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:42,300
on our spirit all of this that we

1057
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:44,579
contend with that's buried in stuff deep

1058
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:46,140
down inside of us and we're getting that

1059
00:43:44,579 --> 00:43:48,119
and it's what's happening we're getting

1060
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:49,560
that out of us and it's drawing into the

1061
00:43:48,119 --> 00:43:51,900
stones

1062
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:54,000
and as it draws into the stones Stones

1063
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:56,040
fill up because what those minerals do

1064
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,200
in the stones is they receive

1065
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:59,880
information and frequency and there's

1066
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:01,440
frequency within your voice there's

1067
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:03,780
frequency coming out of you there's

1068
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:06,780
frequency coming out of your body out of

1069
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:08,760
your soul all of it and the stones are

1070
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:12,420
absorbing that

1071
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:14,940
and then we throw the stones away into

1072
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:16,920
the water on the seventh day I did that

1073
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:19,200
this morning we throw them throw the

1074
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:22,440
stones back into nature and nature then

1075
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:25,200
eats up those emotions in a way that

1076
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:27,240
distance makes a distance between us

1077
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:28,859
different than if we went out to nature

1078
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:30,599
for a meditation or we went out to

1079
00:44:28,859 --> 00:44:32,579
Nature to take a walk and clear our head

1080
00:44:30,599 --> 00:44:36,060
and to actually

1081
00:44:32,579 --> 00:44:38,400
change our own frequency when we got to

1082
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:41,280
Nature and we take a walk a hike we do a

1083
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:43,140
little run we go out there and meditate

1084
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,980
we listen to the birds we look at the

1085
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:46,079
water

1086
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:48,839
and we're doing that to help us heal

1087
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:51,960
right well what this does is the stones

1088
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:55,079
absorb a lot of that old hurt and then

1089
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:57,000
we let the stones go we pull the hurt

1090
00:44:55,079 --> 00:44:59,220
further away from us when the hurt

1091
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:01,980
leaves the Stones The Hurt doesn't run

1092
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:04,079
back to us and recreate patterns we have

1093
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:06,780
this more of an empty space inside of us

1094
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:09,060
now for room for new experiences new

1095
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:11,460
references new positive experiences to

1096
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:13,319
fill back in on the void that was being

1097
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:15,420
taken over by all those stuff down

1098
00:45:13,319 --> 00:45:19,819
emotions this whole time now we're

1099
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:19,819
sitting festering down deep inside

1100
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:26,460
mysticals Ms says I was unexpectedly in

1101
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:29,640
hospital last fall they took my blood at

1102
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:31,859
least twice per day as hemoglobin was

1103
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:33,839
low I said to a nurse maybe it would be

1104
00:45:31,859 --> 00:45:36,060
better if they didn't take so much blood

1105
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:37,200
from me mystical Ms completely

1106
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:39,180
understand

1107
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:41,220
I've watched the industry bleed people

1108
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:44,460
to death but nobody accounts for it

1109
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:46,020
nobody talks about it nobody knows how

1110
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:47,700
much blood is taken from people when

1111
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:49,380
they're sick and then you go to a

1112
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:51,720
specialist and they take another 12

1113
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:53,520
vials then you go to another specialist

1114
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:54,960
they take another 12 vials wait a minute

1115
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:57,000
I'm not done

1116
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:59,280
then you go to a Lyme disease specialist

1117
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:01,859
and they take 40 vials

1118
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:05,819
do you know what happened to all of the

1119
00:46:01,859 --> 00:46:09,000
early Lyme disease cases back in the 80s

1120
00:46:05,819 --> 00:46:11,400
and back in the 90s they were bled

1121
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,319
sickness and then when they got sicker

1122
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:15,420
and sicker from their lime and from

1123
00:46:13,319 --> 00:46:17,880
getting their blood draws they were bled

1124
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:21,839
more and bled more

1125
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:25,440
to Insanity to the death of many people

1126
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:28,760
to the death of many people

1127
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:28,760
very important to know

1128
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:41,060
it's terrifying Jackie B is terrifying

1129
00:46:37,619 --> 00:46:41,060
exactly I concur

1130
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:48,560
smoking cigarettes was safe

1131
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:48,560
until it wasn't

1132
00:46:49,859 --> 00:46:54,260
asbestos was safe until it wasn't

1133
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:58,920
thousands of pharmaceuticals were safe

1134
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:59,940
until they weren't and pulled off the

1135
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:02,960
market

1136
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:02,960
over the decades

1137
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:07,339
pesticides are safe till they weren't

1138
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:13,859
taking a ton of blood was safe until

1139
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:15,900
it's not

1140
00:47:13,859 --> 00:47:18,720
cellular healing on IG says they took

1141
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:21,480
two vials wait a minute I almost said

1142
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:24,480
 I said

1143
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:28,380
cellular healing says they took 21 vials

1144
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:30,660
before I went into labor

1145
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:34,380
21 vials

1146
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:34,380
before Labor

1147
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:42,720
so her healing says in a form of evil so

1148
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:44,640
you have to speak up for yourself it's a

1149
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:46,140
form of evil so you have to speak up for

1150
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:48,240
yourself you have to speak up for

1151
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:49,680
yourself and that's empowerment so what

1152
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:51,960
the haters don't realize about medical

1153
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:54,720
meeting medical meme information is its

1154
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:57,060
true empowerment for you to protect you

1155
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:58,380
I can't believe when I see it all the

1156
00:47:57,060 --> 00:48:00,000
time but then I can believe it the

1157
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:02,460
haters I can believe the haters they're

1158
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,319
jealous right but you see the haters out

1159
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:06,420
there trying to rip down medical medium

1160
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:09,720
in any way possible you see it out there

1161
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:12,240
and you saw the attack on me

1162
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:14,280
not too long ago

1163
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:15,480
you see that

1164
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:17,460
right

1165
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:19,140
and medical medium information is

1166
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:20,579
telling people to protect themselves and

1167
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:22,319
Empower themselves so they don't get

1168
00:48:20,579 --> 00:48:25,520
bled to death

1169
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:25,520
but they don't care

1170
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:34,140
Joe Catherine says they took blood from

1171
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:38,119
my very sick baby son until all of his

1172
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:38,119
veins had collapsed

1173
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:44,700
huge problem happening out there

1174
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:46,800
huge problem

1175
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:49,920
armett says I work in a children's

1176
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:55,260
hospital and off the Record advised my

1177
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:57,060
patients families to request half vials

1178
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:59,819
critical

1179
00:48:57,060 --> 00:49:02,579
truly critical

1180
00:48:59,819 --> 00:49:06,260
Infinite Wellness good to see you my

1181
00:49:02,579 --> 00:49:06,260
lime doctor bled me dry

1182
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:12,900
tens of thousands of women were bled to

1183
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:15,060
death in the 80s

1184
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:18,180
from Lyme disease

1185
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:22,319
they didn't die

1186
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:24,480
from Lyme disease they were sick

1187
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:26,220
from live right and you know medical

1188
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:27,420
medium books talk about what causes lime

1189
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:30,619
they were sick

1190
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:30,619
they were never going to die

1191
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:34,319
meaning in that moment in their life in

1192
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:38,099
that condition in their life and that

1193
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:41,160
age in their life but they were bled

1194
00:49:38,099 --> 00:49:44,040
to an endless sickness and to death for

1195
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:45,780
many of them that's the wake

1196
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:50,760
of the lime world

1197
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:53,099
there are authors and podcasts doctors

1198
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:55,680
that I won't name that were part of the

1199
00:49:53,099 --> 00:49:57,780
LIE movement of bleeding women to death

1200
00:49:55,680 --> 00:50:00,079
and nobody even knows this and knows

1201
00:49:57,780 --> 00:50:00,079
their history

1202
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:04,619
the amount of information I know and

1203
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,119
what happened throughout alternative

1204
00:50:04,619 --> 00:50:08,940
medicine is just would blow your

1205
00:50:06,119 --> 00:50:11,579
freaking mind if you guys

1206
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:13,319
sat on a couch with me and had dinner at

1207
00:50:11,579 --> 00:50:15,599
my house with my family and I told you

1208
00:50:13,319 --> 00:50:18,480
what I knew in so many ways your heads

1209
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:21,780
would just explode

1210
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:23,760
he'd be like what that person that's out

1211
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:25,440
there well who oh my God your heads

1212
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:27,300
would just explode

1213
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:28,740
the thing is they don't have to take so

1214
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:32,099
much blood

1215
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:34,260
they don't have to take so much blood

1216
00:50:32,099 --> 00:50:37,560
very important to know

1217
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:40,400
they only need to take a little drop

1218
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:40,400
I'll show you

1219
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:48,319
and I've showed this to you guys if you

1220
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:48,319
guys have known me for a long time

1221
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:54,599
the truth is is that little dot right

1222
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:58,140
there would give you a thyroid panel

1223
00:50:54,599 --> 00:51:00,900
metabolism panel they call it

1224
00:50:58,140 --> 00:51:03,359
a liver panel

1225
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:06,540
that in babies gives them a forgives

1226
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:09,359
baby's full thyroid panels

1227
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:12,059
diabetics don't even need a drop of

1228
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:15,780
blood down to check their sugar levels

1229
00:51:12,059 --> 00:51:19,200
but only needed a drop tinier than this

1230
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:21,180
they can take a blood tinier than this a

1231
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:23,160
blood drop tinier than this off of a

1232
00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:24,780
pair of jeans from a shallow grave from

1233
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:27,059
1980 from somebody being murdered

1234
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:30,180
murdered and buried in the woods and

1235
00:51:27,059 --> 00:51:32,760
they can go and scrape off a speck of

1236
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:34,619
old dried out blood

1237
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:36,119
and they can do a whole nutritional

1238
00:51:34,619 --> 00:51:37,920
panel on it

1239
00:51:36,119 --> 00:51:40,559
and don't ever get fooled by that whole

1240
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:42,780
BS thing that they need to do a serum

1241
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:45,300
that they need to do with serum that's

1242
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:48,119
not how it works

1243
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:50,880
Denise says I was told that the body

1244
00:51:48,119 --> 00:51:53,819
replaces it in about four to five hours

1245
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:55,800
and that's probably the biggest line of

1246
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:58,099
 in the medical world I've ever

1247
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:58,099
heard

1248
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:05,520
is this waffle done let me get the blood

1249
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:09,440
off the cutting board if you guys don't

1250
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:09,440
mind you get it back in the fridge

1251
00:52:14,819 --> 00:52:17,900
waffle number two

1252
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:23,280
meanwhile most people with symptoms have

1253
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:24,780
a low immune system or immune system

1254
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:27,059
problems

1255
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:28,859
their immune system doesn't come back in

1256
00:52:27,059 --> 00:52:30,420
four to five hours could take weeks and

1257
00:52:28,859 --> 00:52:32,760
could it take even months every time

1258
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:35,880
they draw the blood it could take months

1259
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:38,640
to get their immune system back on track

1260
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:40,559
their bones are struggling to produce it

1261
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:43,200
their bones are struggling they have to

1262
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:45,660
go into overload to produce all that

1263
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:49,400
immune cell

1264
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:49,400
look at that two waffles

1265
00:52:50,059 --> 00:52:55,559
hog heaven without the hog

1266
00:52:53,579 --> 00:52:58,020
the amount of stress on the body the

1267
00:52:55,559 --> 00:53:00,660
electrolytes that are removed the

1268
00:52:58,020 --> 00:53:02,579
um let's go check you for nutritional

1269
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:05,940
deficiencies

1270
00:53:02,579 --> 00:53:08,520
and at the same time let's take 14 vials

1271
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:10,940
of blood or five vials of blood still

1272
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:14,400
too much let's take five vials of blood

1273
00:53:10,940 --> 00:53:16,920
and remove all of your nutritional

1274
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:19,680
critical electrolytes trace minerals

1275
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:22,339
minerals immune cells let's just remove

1276
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:22,339
everything

1277
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:27,900
let me tell you something that's really

1278
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:30,000
important that'll blow your mind

1279
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:31,859
if you had a blood test right after a

1280
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:34,020
blood test

1281
00:53:31,859 --> 00:53:36,059
okay check this out

1282
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:39,359
doctors won't do this no one will do

1283
00:53:36,059 --> 00:53:41,220
this because it will literally show how

1284
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:43,140
sick the system really is and I'm not

1285
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:44,700
saying good doctors good doctors could

1286
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:47,280
be great doctors and just not know this

1287
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:49,200
that's not the problem check this out

1288
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:51,300
you can get a blood test for nutritional

1289
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:53,339
deficiencies and they take out five

1290
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:55,619
vials of blood

1291
00:53:53,339 --> 00:53:57,420
and then if after they took those five

1292
00:53:55,619 --> 00:53:59,400
vials of blood and they sent those five

1293
00:53:57,420 --> 00:54:02,040
vials of blood out

1294
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:04,680
if that same day they took another five

1295
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:07,740
vials of blood you would see that the

1296
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:10,559
second round of blood would be truly

1297
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:13,559
deficient because the first round took

1298
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:15,359
so much critical parts of your supply

1299
00:54:13,559 --> 00:54:18,420
your nutritional Supply that's how

1300
00:54:15,359 --> 00:54:20,040
demented the whole thing really is

1301
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:22,020
all right what I'm going to do is I'm

1302
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:24,059
going to put my waffles here

1303
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:28,160
you guys okay with that

1304
00:54:24,059 --> 00:54:28,160
whoa whoa don't roll away

1305
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:42,240
how's that

1306
00:54:39,839 --> 00:54:44,700
Cara milch over there on YouTube what do

1307
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:46,619
you do if you lost three liters of blood

1308
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:48,900
still here

1309
00:54:46,619 --> 00:54:52,200
but how do you repair yourself after

1310
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:55,880
losing that much blood so in so there's

1311
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:55,880
protocols in brain saver by the way

1312
00:54:57,540 --> 00:55:01,859
even protocol protocols meaning

1313
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:04,319
protocols before blood tests protocols

1314
00:55:01,859 --> 00:55:05,819
after blood work all of that so I'm

1315
00:55:04,319 --> 00:55:06,960
going to do you guys is I'm going to

1316
00:55:05,819 --> 00:55:10,400
slice

1317
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:10,400
this nectarine

1318
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:14,640
you don't have to do this

1319
00:55:12,599 --> 00:55:16,079
I'm doing it but you don't have you know

1320
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:17,760
like this is just

1321
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:18,510
I have these really great nectarines

1322
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:21,300
right now

1323

[Music]

1324
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:25,200
oh crap

1325
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:28,140
I forgot

1326
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:31,319
we need to be deathly afraid of fruit

1327
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:33,540
like deathly afraid of nectarines that's

1328
00:55:31,319 --> 00:55:36,240
right I'm that's right medical medium is

1329
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:39,480
so restrictive so like what am I doing

1330
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:41,280
I'm I'm poisoning you guys with fruit

1331
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:43,079
like what am I doing

1332
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:45,359
anyway I'm gonna slice up this nectarine

1333
00:55:43,079 --> 00:55:47,940
heal infertility says now I know why I

1334
00:55:45,359 --> 00:55:49,500
feel sick after a blood draw oh yeah

1335
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:51,660
and here's the problem if you're

1336
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:53,760
actually sick with a chronic illness and

1337
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:56,040
you don't recover fast enough from a

1338
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:57,900
blood draw check this out

1339
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:59,700
and you call the doctor and say look I'm

1340
00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:01,440
feeling sick don't want you in for

1341
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:02,940
another line of blood for another blood

1342
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:04,500
draw and then ready for this you get

1343
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:05,700
sick or two weeks later because of that

1344
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:06,960
second round of blood and guess what

1345
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:08,880
you're now at a specialist office

1346
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:12,000
getting 24 vials of blood and now you're

1347
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:14,460
going downhill downhill fast they just

1348
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:15,960
need to take a lower amount of blood I

1349
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:18,380
talk about that all in the brain saver

1350
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:18,380
books

1351
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:22,579
so I'm going to do is I'm going to slice

1352
00:56:28,619 --> 00:56:31,700
I'm gonna slice

1353
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:37,020
this here if you guys don't mind I'm

1354
00:56:35,099 --> 00:56:40,440
gonna put that like that

1355
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:43,559
an IG Dale hodgin says like Anthony says

1356
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:47,579
they don't need loads of blood when at

1357
00:56:43,559 --> 00:56:51,000
crime scenes for DNA profile

1358
00:56:47,579 --> 00:56:53,099
one drop of blood at a crime scene

1359
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:55,260
would take care of a liver

1360
00:56:53,099 --> 00:57:00,300
liver enzymes

1361
00:56:55,260 --> 00:57:02,819
Billy Rubin all of it like thyroid panel

1362
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:07,579
um like you name it it would just take

1363
00:57:02,819 --> 00:57:07,579
care of all that one stinking drop

1364
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:15,260
I'm gonna try to do it this way now I'm

1365
00:57:12,059 --> 00:57:15,260
going to slice it different ways

1366
00:57:16,650 --> 00:57:21,240
[Music]

1367

wow

1369
00:57:24,599 --> 00:57:27,660
I haven't talked about blood draw in a

1370
00:57:26,339 --> 00:57:28,619
while it wasn't going to be a blood draw

1371
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:31,500
talk

1372
00:57:28,619 --> 00:57:33,720
it just wasn't it's it's the seventh day

1373
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:35,280
the medical medium collecting Stones

1374
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:38,579
meditation Journey

1375
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:43,220
everybody's throwing their stones

1376
00:57:38,579 --> 00:57:43,220
into nature letting go their stones

1377
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:46,819
can I have this

1378
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:51,500
um

1379
00:57:55,619 --> 00:58:00,839
I'm Gonna Save this

1380
00:57:57,780 --> 00:58:02,940
because I want to eat that part and then

1381
00:58:00,839 --> 00:58:05,460
eat that part and then eat all the way

1382
00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:06,900
around the pit

1383
00:58:05,460 --> 00:58:08,940
good

1384
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:10,619
it's an insane nectarine nectarine

1385
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:14,220
season insane

1386
00:58:10,619 --> 00:58:17,220
Alicia on YouTube the lab keeps saying

1387
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:19,140
if they take small amounts of blood that

1388
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:21,420
the patient needs to come back for more

1389
00:58:19,140 --> 00:58:23,460
blood drawn because the lab can't run

1390
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:25,140
the test not true

1391
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:27,000
there are so many people who are so

1392
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:28,980
dehydrated and can they can't even get

1393
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:31,380
blood out of people and they take the

1394
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:34,819
smallest vial of blood

1395
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:38,220
it's just that that's how the scam works

1396
00:58:34,819 --> 00:58:40,440
don't let it mess babies they take small

1397
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:42,000
vials and they run everything because

1398
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:45,000
they know better they know they can't

1399
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:46,859
take 12 large vials out of a baby

1400
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:48,780
because they'll kill the baby think

1401
00:58:46,859 --> 00:58:50,880
about that so what they do is they take

1402
00:58:48,780 --> 00:58:52,740
tiny baby vials in only a couple and

1403
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:54,839
they run all the same tests how do they

1404
00:58:52,740 --> 00:58:56,460
do it you have to make a serum I don't

1405
00:58:54,839 --> 00:58:59,420
understand it's a small amount of blood

1406
00:58:56,460 --> 00:58:59,420
how does it work

1407
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:05,720
thank you

1408
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:10,200
I can ask myself questions all day long

1409
00:59:08,099 --> 00:59:12,660
and I'll get the answers for it and it

1410
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:14,700
will be because the system is scamming

1411
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:16,920
people

1412
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:19,160
I'm just gonna throw one more waffle in

1413
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:19,160
here

1414
00:59:20,099 --> 00:59:27,540
yoga love meditation on IG

1415
00:59:24,119 --> 00:59:30,540
they took three vials to test for low

1416
00:59:27,540 --> 00:59:34,859
iron and I fainted

1417
00:59:30,540 --> 00:59:36,480
three full vials can do that for a lot

1418
00:59:34,859 --> 00:59:38,280
of people

1419
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:39,420
they really need to do take quarter

1420
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:41,339
tubes

1421
00:59:39,420 --> 00:59:42,780
two quarter tubes if the doctor says

1422
00:59:41,339 --> 00:59:44,040
well we can only run these amount of

1423
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:45,599
tests with those two quarter tubes and

1424
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:47,220
you come back a couple weeks and you

1425
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:48,540
take two more quarter tubes right that's

1426
00:59:47,220 --> 00:59:51,559
what I would do too

1427
00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:51,559
if that's the case

1428
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:58,440
I have another waffle coming up I'm

1429
00:59:55,619 --> 01:00:01,040

waffle that's

1431
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:08,720

1433
01:00:09,660 --> 01:00:16,339
your blood is a life force that demands

1434
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:16,339
respect

1435
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:24,839

thing you can fish out is an old penny

1476
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:24,420
there's got to be tremendous meaning in

1477
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:28,099
that

1478
01:02:24,420 --> 01:02:28,099
tremendous meaning in that

1479
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:47,220
I know I'm speechless over that one I am

1480
01:02:44,339 --> 01:02:49,460
because I'm asking SOC questions that's

1481
01:02:47,220 --> 01:02:49,460
why

1482
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:53,240
I'm asking questions

1483
01:02:58,280 --> 01:03:03,059
I got another waffle cooking if you guys

Elvis lives

01:03:30,420 --> 01:03:35,839
I can't walk out

1497
01:03:33,180 --> 01:03:35,839

1498
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:44,640
educating myself good to see you my

1499

1500
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:47,059
out loud

1501
01:03:53,940 --> 01:03:57,960
I'm laughing a little bit but I'm not

1502
01:03:56,280 --> 01:04:00,299
going into that whole like laugh attack

1503
01:03:57,960 --> 01:04:01,500
thing thank God or you know I hit the

1504
01:04:00,299 --> 01:04:03,599
floor

1505
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:05,940
remember that happened on the Amazon

1506
01:04:03,599 --> 01:04:08,220
live a long time ago when I hit the I I

1507
01:04:05,940 --> 01:04:10,200
hit the floor I was laughing so hard I

1508
01:04:08,220 --> 01:04:11,540
couldn't I was rolling around on the

1509
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:14,640
floor

1510
01:04:11,540 --> 01:04:17,099
Elaine says on YouTube they took three

1511
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:19,619
vials of blood from my daughter when she

1512
01:04:17,099 --> 01:04:21,839
was about 10 years old and she hardly

1513
01:04:19,619 --> 01:04:23,700
weighed anything she almost immediately

1514
01:04:21,839 --> 01:04:26,339
vomited afterwards from the drastic

1515
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:28,500
changes it created

1516
01:04:26,339 --> 01:04:31,740
hemorrhagic shock

1517
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:33,059
that's what I said I said hemorrhage

1518
01:04:31,740 --> 01:04:34,740
um

1519
01:04:33,059 --> 01:04:37,200
even the thing is is I talk about this

1520
01:04:34,740 --> 01:04:39,000
in the brain saver books what determines

1521
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:41,280
hemorrhagic shock

1522
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:42,900
what determines it because science

1523
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:44,400
doesn't really know they're like well

1524
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:45,839
when most of the blood is drained out of

1525
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:47,339
your body that's pretty much when you go

1526
01:04:45,839 --> 01:04:49,020
into hemorrhagic shock well really

1527
01:04:47,339 --> 01:04:50,760
because there's people that go and

1528
01:04:49,020 --> 01:04:52,079
donate blood and they're in hemorrhagic

1529
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:54,299
shock and they can't even get out of the

1530
01:04:52,079 --> 01:04:56,220
chair they're in shock for weeks and

1531
01:04:54,299 --> 01:04:58,260
weeks

1532
01:04:56,220 --> 01:04:59,940
they barely can get them home in some

1533
01:04:58,260 --> 01:05:01,559
apple juice in a cookie it doesn't cut

1534
01:04:59,940 --> 01:05:05,180
it

1535
01:05:01,559 --> 01:05:05,180
Michelle says love Elvis too

1536
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:09,020
respect respect

1537
01:05:09,299 --> 01:05:14,579
marja says Dr Nesbitt came and helped

1538
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:16,980
you out of from a laugh attack it was

1539
01:05:14,579 --> 01:05:18,540
the only time he was useful

1540
01:05:16,980 --> 01:05:20,400
indeed

1541
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:24,180
indeed

1542
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:26,339
but Dr nesbeth does like Elvis

1543
01:05:24,180 --> 01:05:27,839
Dr Nesbitt saw Elvis in Concert many

1544
01:05:26,339 --> 01:05:32,240
many years ago

1545
01:05:27,839 --> 01:05:32,240
Dr Nesbitt is a very old chicken doctor

1546
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:37,920
yep

1547
01:05:35,579 --> 01:05:40,380
all right I'm just cooking one last

1548
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:43,940
um waffle I'm gonna probably throw it in

1549
01:05:40,380 --> 01:05:43,940
a plate over here

1550
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:47,700
you guys saw mine

1551
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:49,380
okay and then I'm gonna get some maple

1552
01:05:47,700 --> 01:05:51,720
syrup on them but I didn't want to put

1553
01:05:49,380 --> 01:05:55,460
the maple syrup on them yet I wanted to

1554
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:55,460
give it a little time before I do that

1555
01:05:56,280 --> 01:06:01,760
you guys are at my kitchen

1556
01:05:58,559 --> 01:06:01,760
I am at your service

1557
01:06:02,099 --> 01:06:07,859
a mattress service marja says I release

1558
01:06:04,740 --> 01:06:09,839
my stones into a creek

1559
01:06:07,859 --> 01:06:11,880
whoa let me see that I release my stones

1560
01:06:09,839 --> 01:06:16,099
into a creek that I didn't know existed

1561
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:16,099
close to my place Maria sorry Maria

1562
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:21,059
I gotta get name straight here juggling

1563
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:23,400
a lot I release my storage into a creek

1564
01:06:21,059 --> 01:06:25,920
that I didn't know existed close to my

1565
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:29,039
place they guided me there I got back

1566
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:32,960
into my car and the song Freedom from

1567
01:06:29,039 --> 01:06:32,960
George Michael was playing on the radio

1568
01:06:33,119 --> 01:06:39,359
that's incredible

1569
01:06:35,839 --> 01:06:40,740
loan over here on Facebook says I had a

1570
01:06:39,359 --> 01:06:43,559
difference in my thoughts immediately

1571
01:06:40,740 --> 01:06:46,020
after letting them go I don't think like

1572
01:06:43,559 --> 01:06:49,500
I used to

1573
01:06:46,020 --> 01:06:51,480
I had a extremely personal experience

1574
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:53,760
when I

1575
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:55,559
put my stones out there and yes one of

1576
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:57,839
the stones almost hit a turtle

1577
01:06:55,559 --> 01:07:01,339
but it didn't hit the turtle

1578
01:06:57,839 --> 01:07:01,339
it did not hit the turtle

1579
01:07:01,559 --> 01:07:06,119
it almost hit the turtle and I was like

1580
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:08,359
whoa

1581
01:07:06,119 --> 01:07:08,359
oh

1582
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:14,480
didn't hit the turtle

1583
01:07:14,700 --> 01:07:21,480
Kimmy said my four day old newborn had

1584
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:26,039
so much blood taken to test

1585
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:29,339
oh my God for galactosemia it was the

1586
01:07:26,039 --> 01:07:31,380
worst 18 hours of my life watching it

1587
01:07:29,339 --> 01:07:34,039
unfold

1588
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:34,039
kills me

1589
01:07:34,140 --> 01:07:36,740
it does

1590
01:07:42,299 --> 01:07:46,500
the blood draw information is just one

1591
01:07:44,339 --> 01:07:48,720
example of mm information you could be

1592
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:50,339
plant-based but not MediCal medium

1593
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:52,680
plant-based you could be animal based

1594
01:07:50,339 --> 01:07:54,420
and not MediCal medium animal based

1595
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:56,520
you can say you're doing medical medium

1596
01:07:54,420 --> 01:07:57,839
and not even really do medical medium I

1597
01:07:56,520 --> 01:07:59,520
know that some people do that out there

1598
01:07:57,839 --> 01:08:01,440
they do one little thing at one point

1599
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:02,760
and then they say I tried medical media

1600
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:04,140
but they really didn't even read the

1601
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:06,799
books there's so many different

1602
01:08:04,140 --> 01:08:06,799
situations

1603
01:08:07,020 --> 01:08:12,000
Ardent over there in Facebook says I

1604
01:08:09,780 --> 01:08:14,039
collapsed after donating blood and never

1605
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:15,359
again exclamation point was tired for

1606
01:08:14,039 --> 01:08:17,640
weeks afterwards

1607
01:08:15,359 --> 01:08:20,699
people sick should not donate blood

1608
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:25,380
meaning like it's not it's too hard on

1609
01:08:20,699 --> 01:08:27,719
the body and they only the the 98 of

1610
01:08:25,380 --> 01:08:31,259
blood roughly around that that number

1611
01:08:27,719 --> 01:08:34,560
depending on what year the majority of

1612
01:08:31,259 --> 01:08:36,900
people donating blood are sick women

1613
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:38,339
because you're told to donate blood by

1614
01:08:36,900 --> 01:08:41,880
their doctors

1615
01:08:38,339 --> 01:08:43,080
and organizations they send women who

1616
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:44,640
are struggling and suffering with

1617
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:47,219
sickness and chronic illness to donate

1618
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:48,359
blood that's who's donating blood it's

1619
01:08:47,219 --> 01:08:50,219
not all the people that are walking

1620
01:08:48,359 --> 01:08:51,960
around fine and they're not suffering

1621
01:08:50,219 --> 01:08:55,080
from chronic illness yet they're not

1622
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:57,120
told to donate blood it's literally all

1623
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:58,560
the women who are sick being told to

1624
01:08:57,120 --> 01:09:01,259
donate blood

1625
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:03,799
does that make any sense to you

1626
01:09:01,259 --> 01:09:03,799
oh

1627
01:09:06,179 --> 01:09:11,160
Dr Fawn says yet if you create a company

1628
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:13,199
that can do many tests from a drop of

1629
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:16,140
blood you'll end up in jail and

1630
01:09:13,199 --> 01:09:18,540
character assassinated correct you also

We're All in This Together

1805
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:08,760
there's something that happens when we

1806
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:10,679
release these stones

1807
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:12,960
all jokes aside

1808
01:17:10,679 --> 01:17:15,500
all kidding aside

1809
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:15,500
okay

1810
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:24,840
we carry baggage

1811
01:17:21,659 --> 01:17:26,820
we do suitcases

1812
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:29,880
of baggage

1813
01:17:26,820 --> 01:17:32,520
some smaller suitcases some bigger

1814
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:34,860
suitcases but we

1815
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:37,800
in order to survive here on Earth we

1816
01:17:34,860 --> 01:17:39,300
stuff stuff down we say sometimes oh I'm

1817
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:42,860
just gonna let it roll off my back but

1818
01:17:39,300 --> 01:17:42,860
it doesn't mean it rolled off your back

1819
01:17:43,679 --> 01:17:48,840
and there's that phrase where people say

1820
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:49,920
I can forgive but I'm never going to

1821
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:51,300
forget

1822
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:53,520
you're never going to forget because

1823
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:56,400
that wound is actually in the soul it's

1824
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:59,100
actually a part of you now it travels

1825
01:17:56,400 --> 01:18:01,860
with us when we leave here

1826
01:17:59,100 --> 01:18:04,620
when we leave here

1827
01:18:01,860 --> 01:18:07,380
this is an opportunity

1828
01:18:04,620 --> 01:18:09,659
to start drawing some of that out of us

1829
01:18:07,380 --> 01:18:11,040
so when we name those three stones and

1830
01:18:09,659 --> 01:18:12,420
we make that connection with those three

1831
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:14,820
stones and those three stones have

1832
01:18:12,420 --> 01:18:16,800
chosen us or we chose them or they chose

1833
01:18:14,820 --> 01:18:19,800
us or we chose them

1834
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:22,380
those stones are absorbing that wound

1835
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:25,320
that information no scars and absorbing

1836
01:18:22,380 --> 01:18:27,239
that and then we get to day seven and in

1837
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:29,699
that day seven it's time and we release

1838
01:18:27,239 --> 01:18:33,020
those stones back out to Nature we

1839
01:18:29,699 --> 01:18:33,020
release them back out there

1840
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:37,400
and those stones

1841
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:43,260
that were your friends all along that

1842
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:46,380
did not judge you did not make fun of

1843
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:48,719
you weren't mean to you

1844
01:18:46,380 --> 01:18:49,800
they were there they were conduits they

1845
01:18:48,719 --> 01:18:52,920
were

1846
01:18:49,800 --> 01:18:56,100
sponges to absorb any pain suffering

1847
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:57,960
along the way Old Wounds to clear a

1848
01:18:56,100 --> 01:18:59,760
space inside of us because when that

1849
01:18:57,960 --> 01:19:02,400
space is filled up with all that hurts

1850
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:04,320
it's hard to press forward without being

1851
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:06,360
triggered and we get stuck in patterns

1852
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:10,080
so what I'm trying to say is those

1853
01:19:06,360 --> 01:19:12,719
stones are the pattern Breakers

1854
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:15,500
come on we throw those stones away the

1855
01:19:12,719 --> 01:19:18,780
stones take

1856
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:22,080
that hurt and that hurt doesn't come

1857
01:19:18,780 --> 01:19:24,060
rushing back into you because it's

1858
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:26,159
thrown in the air it's attached to the

1859
01:19:24,060 --> 01:19:27,480
Stones it's in the Stones it's absorbed

1860
01:19:26,159 --> 01:19:28,320
into those minerals and when those

1861
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:31,400
stones

1862
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:31,400
go flying

1863
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:39,080
and hit that water or hit those woods or

1864
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:44,040
hit that nature

1865
01:19:39,080 --> 01:19:47,760
boom it's already neutralizing

1866
01:19:44,040 --> 01:19:50,460
already being diffused

1867
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:52,679
and unable to rush back to us if you're

1868
01:19:50,460 --> 01:19:55,080
bedridden and you cannot release these

1869
01:19:52,679 --> 01:19:57,179
stones of yours have someone else do it

1870
01:19:55,080 --> 01:19:59,280
for you and if you can't do it on the

1871
01:19:57,179 --> 01:20:01,080
day seven that's okay if you're someone

1872
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:03,239
who's bedridden if somebody who's you

1873
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:04,860
get so many you've been compromised in

1874
01:20:03,239 --> 01:20:06,000
so many ways you've been injured or

1875
01:20:04,860 --> 01:20:07,739
you've been suffering or struggling

1876
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:09,659
you're just too sick right now in the

1877
01:20:07,739 --> 01:20:11,100
moment to get up and go somewhere or you

1878
01:20:09,659 --> 01:20:12,900
don't have a way to travel and get

1879
01:20:11,100 --> 01:20:15,300
somewhere have somebody else release

1880
01:20:12,900 --> 01:20:16,679
your stones for you it's okay and if it

1881
01:20:15,300 --> 01:20:20,060
can't happen today that's all right

1882
01:20:16,679 --> 01:20:20,060
we're doing another day

1883
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:27,980
singing sweetly says can I start again

1884
01:20:23,820 --> 01:20:27,980
tomorrow I have lots of baggage

1885
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:34,020
give it a couple days give it a couple

1886
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:36,719
days give it a week give it a little

1887
01:20:34,020 --> 01:20:38,219
time to just let what happened happen

1888
01:20:36,719 --> 01:20:40,560
because things are going to surface

1889
01:20:38,219 --> 01:20:41,940
feelings are going to happen Sears gonna

1890
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:45,300
sense healing you're going to sense

1891
01:20:41,940 --> 01:20:47,580
healing emotionally give it a chance to

1892
01:20:45,300 --> 01:20:48,719
sense it to feel it give it a chance for

1893
01:20:47,580 --> 01:20:51,980
it to happen

1894
01:20:48,719 --> 01:20:51,980
and then yeah you can do it

1895
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:58,500
Maria says on YouTube can you walk down

1896
01:20:55,620 --> 01:21:00,600
the street and drop the stones

1897
01:20:58,500 --> 01:21:03,179
indeed you can

1898
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:04,980
you can't

1899
01:21:03,179 --> 01:21:06,600
and the birds

1900
01:21:04,980 --> 01:21:08,760
in the sky

1901
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:11,159
and the breeze

1902
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:13,920
that's flowing across the Earth

1903
01:21:11,159 --> 01:21:18,120
that's going down the street

1904
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:20,159
and the rain that's coming from above

1905
01:21:18,120 --> 01:21:22,560
all of that

1906
01:21:20,159 --> 01:21:27,620
will eventually

1907
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:27,620
hit the stones and help neutralize them

1908
01:21:31,260 --> 01:21:34,020
a lot of people aren't going to want to

1909
01:21:32,640 --> 01:21:36,179
release stones

1910
01:21:34,020 --> 01:21:39,380
but it's a good day to release them if

1911
01:21:36,179 --> 01:21:39,380
you can and have the option

1912
01:21:41,460 --> 01:21:45,840
top secret hustle over there on YouTube

1913
01:21:43,380 --> 01:21:48,179
says can I keep Stones longer I would

1914
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:51,860
release them this was a seven day

1915
01:21:48,179 --> 01:21:51,860
healing Journey exercise

1916
01:21:52,620 --> 01:21:55,739
are

1917
01:21:54,300 --> 01:21:57,480
you might say you'll keep them a little

1918
01:21:55,739 --> 01:21:59,400
longer and let them go but you may never

1919
01:21:57,480 --> 01:22:01,380
let them go and you want to complete the

1920
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:03,960
healing we have all done it together

1921
01:22:01,380 --> 01:22:07,380
let's actually make it

1922
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:09,659
a thing we all do together

1923
01:22:07,380 --> 01:22:12,659
RS says to think I used to donate blood

1924
01:22:09,659 --> 01:22:15,600
monthly to survive they pay a bit of

1925
01:22:12,659 --> 01:22:18,060
money and gave me a meal when I was poor

1926
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:20,520
I really needed that but now it makes me

1927
01:22:18,060 --> 01:22:22,560
feel so sad how much blood I gave away

1928
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:24,179
but it's okay it's okay lightheart but

1929
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:25,920
you know better now and you know and I

1930
01:22:24,179 --> 01:22:28,260
know that you did it to survive you

1931
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:30,540
never never beat yourself up for that

1932
01:22:28,260 --> 01:22:32,760
you did it to survive

1933
01:22:30,540 --> 01:22:34,500
if I was on the street and I had no

1934
01:22:32,760 --> 01:22:36,360
place to live I had no way to pay

1935
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:38,340
anything or buy food or anything like

1936
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:40,020
that you know what it can push you into

1937
01:22:38,340 --> 01:22:42,060
something like that when you're sitting

1938
01:22:40,020 --> 01:22:44,520
in a chair getting blood drawn because

1939
01:22:42,060 --> 01:22:46,380
of that

1940
01:22:44,520 --> 01:22:48,840
it can happen

1941
01:22:46,380 --> 01:22:50,580
lightheart

1942
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:51,780

1943
01:22:50,580 --> 01:22:54,360

1948
01:23:01,860 --> 01:23:06,300

1949
01:23:03,300 --> 01:23:08,040
nope you do not have to go to the same

1950
01:23:06,300 --> 01:23:09,480
place

1951
01:23:08,040 --> 01:23:11,219
you don't have to

1952
01:23:09,480 --> 01:23:13,140
you can go

1953
01:23:11,219 --> 01:23:15,380
to a different place to release your

1954
01:23:13,140 --> 01:23:15,380
stones

1955
01:23:21,179 --> 01:23:24,020

so many emotional releasing modalities

1998
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:44,699
over the past 20 years plus years

1999
01:25:42,300 --> 01:25:48,540
nothing compares to releasing emotions

2000
01:25:44,699 --> 01:25:51,120
with the stones no processing required

2001
01:25:48,540 --> 01:25:54,300
I'm gonna frame that and put that on my

2002
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:56,280
wall in my office okay when I put that

2003
01:25:54,300 --> 01:25:58,580
on the wall in my office I'm gonna frame

2004
01:25:56,280 --> 01:25:58,580
that

2005
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:06,920

2006
01:26:02,280 --> 01:26:06,920
