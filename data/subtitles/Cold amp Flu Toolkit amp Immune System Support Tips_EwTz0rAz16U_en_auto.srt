talking about cold and flu season and

75
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:17,400
it's not you know I know I was kidding

76
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:19,739
around and I was caught I was fake

77
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:22,140
coughing but it's not a joke I mean I've

78
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:25,860
seen the flu knock people on their butt

79
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:27,480
like knock people on their butt I mean

80
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:29,519
it's not just the phlegm it's not just

81
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,440
the mucus but it's also the cough

82
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,659
involved where they're coughing all

83
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,700
night they're having coughing attacks in

84
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:37,440
the morning they got the fevers they

85
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:39,659
don't feel well you got the runny nose

86
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:43,140
the sniffles your body aches everything

87
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:45,120
it's all in the above right and

88
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:47,400
if you're already dealing with something

89
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,739
if you're already compromised in some

90
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:52,500
way with your health somehow some way

91
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:54,959
compromised it doesn't make things

92
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:57,360
easier that's the hard part right there

93
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,879
so what I see out there

94
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,200
as people they're struggling with some

95
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:02,400
kind of chronic condition or chronic

96
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,080
illness they got all these different

97
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,239
symptoms and then they get whacked with

98
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:09,420
the flu and then boom you know they're

99
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:11,040
hit so hard another thing too is a lot

100
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,700
of people have a lot of things inside of

101
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,260
them

102
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,220
they'll have like the Epstein bars

103
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,420
they'll have all these other different

104
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,100
conditions they'll have all these

105
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:18,120
different bugs and pathogens in them and

106
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:21,120
I'll have all these other different

107
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:24,360
things and then the flu comes along and

108
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,860
it just hits you and then you're in it a

109
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,259
lot of people I've seen this and then

110
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:30,600
you can't come out of it it's too hard

111
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:33,180
to come out of it's like the flu that

112
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:35,340
lasts for months long flu and it just

113
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:36,720
lasts and lasts I talked about this for

114
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:39,120
years you guys know I've talked about

115
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,820
this for years right so

116
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,340
I don't like cold and flu season I don't

117
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:45,840
like cold and flu in general because if

118
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:47,940
it's not the stomach flu then it's

119
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,199
another flu and it's another one so I

120
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:50,759
don't like it in general because it's

121
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,940
around all the time and it really hits

122
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:55,560
people but what I wanted to do because I

123
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:57,960
want to offer as much free information

124
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:00,000

wall you don't have to pay for this is

127
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:08,340
it it isn't a pay scheme that's the

128
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:10,380
thing like the pay the Ponzi schemes the

129
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:13,199

130
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:16,440
there that's crazy it's not that it's

131
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:18,960
free if that's what it is but it wasn't

132
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:22,680
free to put together that's the whole

133
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:26,160
point okay it took money to put together

134
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:28,800
it took medical medium money to put it

135
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,560
together medical medium take money out

136
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:34,320
of his pockets okay he had to take money

137
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:36,539
out of his pockets and he had a he has

138
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:39,660
to have his team working and he has to

139
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:41,880
pay his team okay a lot of money

140
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:43,259
and then they helped to put it all

141
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:47,280
together with me

142
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:49,620
so I pay to do everything but yeah it's

143
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,740
all free for everybody else that's how

144
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:55,919

all right you guys let's go let's get

148
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:04,800

pockets back in my pants please

150
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:10,979
I don't think we need to do that

151
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:13,500
so Kim Miller says Anthony's got the 80s

152
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:15,300
flare with the popped up collar yes the

153
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:18,180
pop-up collar is not working good today

154
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:19,979
one of the colors is over here is not

155
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:23,039
popped up enough

156
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:24,360
I've asked just my life anyway so I want

157
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,160
to talk about this because this

158
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:29,280
information that's really important cold

159
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:32,340
and flu coming around keep the immune

160
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:35,699
system strong Diane Eva says ew has a

161
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:37,860
new hat yes I do indeed I like hats I

162
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:40,440
like baseball caps it's so easy you

163
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:43,500
throw it on you don't have to comb your

164
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:46,199
hair you don't have to do anything and I

165
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:48,840
have curly hair curly hair does not comb

166
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:50,940
right so it's a pain in the butt so boom

167
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:52,380
I throw the hat on and I'm happy and it

168
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:54,960
takes two seconds

169
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:55,919
because I'm already busy enough as it is

170
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,380
anyway

171
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:03,360
I know it's a lazy approach when I do

172
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:04,800
that but whatever but you guys all right

173
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,539
it's important to keep our immune system

174
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,060
strong during this type of time of year

175
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:12,240
especially when we're extra stressed

176
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:16,680
family holidays extra stress everything

177
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:18,900
involved weather changes all of it so it

178
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,819
is very important so let's talk about

179
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,700

180
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:24,120

00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:31,020
to try to get a shot glass in a minute

184
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:33,360
so anyway this is the Imaging products

185
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:34,560
right you guys know it's I'm going to

186
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,840
tell you right now

187
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,400
hands down there's no company doing what

188
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:40,080
vimergy does

189
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,460
there's no company out there doing what

190
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,440
the Emoji does

191
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:45,840
it doesn't exist out there

192
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:48,120
it's an honor and a privilege to be able

193
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,639
to be in this world right now

194
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:53,400
while something is created that's

195
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:57,180
finally really clean it's just it's so

196
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:59,039
important and um got my shot glass right

197
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:03,300
there don't throw glasses in the air

198
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:05,639
whatever you do that was a bad idea so

199
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:08,160
with a zinc's a great one for the immune

200
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:09,840

220
00:08:56,339 --> 00:09:03,480

225
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:17,760

00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,740

227
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,500

231
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:33,300
vimorgy.com these invictor I am is Mary

232
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:36,600
e r g y

233
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:37,980
so what I love about the products is

234
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,140
four things I'll give you the four

235
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:41,700
things really quick they don't have any

236
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:44,160
hidden things that they're not

237
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:47,880
disclosing okay

238
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:49,800
so label requirements allow companies to

239
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:52,320
hide a certain percentage inside their

240
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:54,120
supplements a small certain percentage

241
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,580
that you don't know about that's in the

242
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:58,019
supplements of imagery says no we're not

243
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:00,360
going to do that it's not going to

244
00:09:58,019 --> 00:10:02,880
happen and that's a big deal all on its

245
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:05,160
own you can't find that anywhere in my

246
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,600
opinion it does not exist I've asked all

247
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,519
the supplement companies out there that

248
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,959
I could talk to and find I've looked

249
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:11,580
into so much over the years and it

250
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:13,399
doesn't happen the other thing is

251
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:17,220
Bemidji products are third party

252
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:19,980
independently tested boom I'm telling

253
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:23,459
you that means so much another thing too

254
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:26,459
they don't have the natural flavors

255
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:28,019
they don't have the maltodextrin they

256
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:29,940
don't have the alcohol they don't have

257
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:30,959
the vinegar the alcohol is a big one

258
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,800
right now I'm going to tell you right

259
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:35,339
now

260
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:36,899
alcohol in supplementation like for

261
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:39,120
instance the propolis doesn't have the

262
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:41,700
propylene glycol

263
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:45,540
the propolis doesn't have the propylene

264
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:47,160
glycol in it that's critical and even

265
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:50,279
when there's propolis out there they'll

266
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:52,260
say oh alcohol free it doesn't work that

267
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:53,940
way so it's another reason why I love

268
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:56,700
the Bemidji products because there's no

269
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:59,339
it's not just about no soy it's not just

270
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:00,720
about no gluten it's about no vinegar no

271
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:02,820
caffeine no natural flavors no

272
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:06,600
artificial flavors no titanium dioxide

273
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:09,540
no alcohol no citric acid huge one no

274
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:12,360
maltodextrin huge one it's about all of

275
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:13,740
that and then it's about not hiding

276
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,300
something in there they're not

277
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:17,279
disclosing

278
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:20,519
boom it's incredible when I think about

279
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:21,660
it and then the quality aspect right so

280
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:23,100
because you know we're talking about

281
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,360
cold and flu if you guys just got on

282
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,820
here we're talking about cold and flu

283
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:28,500
support immune system all that's cold

284
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:31,320
and flu season I'm talking about why I

285
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:33,839
support memory so Alicia says my family

286
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:35,519
has dodged the crazy illnesses flying

287
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,260
around my daughter's school I'm so

288
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,839
grateful for zinc shock therapy and

289
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:41,700
vitamin C shock therapy we're healthier

290
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:45,300
than we've been in years and I'm gonna

291
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:46,740
do a little vitamin C shock therapy in a

292
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,959
couple of minutes too that's incredible

293
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:52,740
and

294
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:54,360
so the quality aspect see if you take a

295
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:55,800
bunch of money it's just going to be

296
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,720
straight up and no one talks about this

297
00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:01,620
no one so what you're hearing right now

298
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:02,700
no one talks about okay if you take a

299
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:05,220
bunch of money

300
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:06,720
like a whole ton of money right or

301
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:08,220
whatever and you want to start your

302
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,320
supplement company

303
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:12,720
you take a bunch of money

304
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:15,480
you're gonna go to a manufacturer

305
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:18,300
somewhere that manufacturer is going to

306
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:19,800
give you their bottom of the barrel

307
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:22,200
product

308
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:23,459
your your ingredients and you're going

309
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,380
to be like well is this quality and

310
00:12:23,459 --> 00:12:27,360
they're like oh yeah it's quality and

311
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:31,019
you're like okay cool let me just pay

312
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:33,420
for it and the price point right oh

313
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:35,760
that's the best one to get sure I'll get

314
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:38,880
it but it's not the best when no one

315
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:42,060
talks about is supplement companies by

316
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:45,240
the lower quality so they can charge

317
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:46,860
more and then make a bigger profit do

318
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:51,180
you see how it works

319
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:54,860
you buy the lower quality ingredient so

320
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:57,240
you can charge more and make more right

321
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:59,700
it's all business

322
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:01,500
and that's what it is the reason why I

323
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:03,240
endorsed these guys fully wholeheartedly

324
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,680
and I want this stuff to stay around I

325
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:07,139
want it to be here because it's not

326
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:09,120
about business it's about people it's

327
00:13:07,139 --> 00:13:11,760
about people

328
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:14,579
and that's the key and quality really

329
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:16,260
matters when it's real it makes the

330
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:17,820
difference

331
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:19,320
so I'm just I'm gonna say I'm talking

332
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:22,200
about something people don't talk about

333
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:23,880
you guys like this is not not allowed to

334
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:26,760
be talked about out there it's like one

335
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:29,459
of the secrets so if you start

336
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:30,720
a supplement company you go to a

337
00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:34,560
manufacturer

338
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:37,320
and you buy the low quality stuff so you

339
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:39,720
can make a lot of money right

340
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:42,959
they don't do that they buy the highest

341
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:44,820
they can find that's possible the

342
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,440
highest and best quality that they can

343
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:49,800
find that's possible and they don't care

344
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:52,500
about the price point the reason why is

345
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:54,120
because this mom-and-pop company cares

346
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:56,880
about the person

347
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:58,139
taking it and that I've never seen

348
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,540
before

349
00:13:58,139 --> 00:14:03,000
I have to talk about it I gotta because

350
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:04,800
I've never seen it before the energy is

351
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,420
so good for the body and so Milda says

352
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,980
so you guys were talking about cold and

353
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:09,540
flu I've got the memory supplements in

354
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:12,120
front of me because that's what I take

355
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:13,800
to keep my immune system Strong saying

356
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:15,720
Sue says when I got the Critter last

357
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:17,399
month on top of bronchitis by the way

358
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:19,019
I'm sorry that happened to you when I

359
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:21,540
got the Critter last month on top of

360
00:14:19,019 --> 00:14:24,120
bronchitis and strep throat uh 100

361
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:26,820
believe the Bemidji supplements saved my

362
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:29,160
life I know if I would have gotten it

363
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:30,839
without all the medical medium tools I'd

364
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,940

372
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:50,940

ingredients

413
00:16:20,699 --> 00:16:25,980

414
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:27,720
the cheaper a lot of ingredients that

415
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:28,500
the manufacturer puts all together for

416
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:32,279
them

417
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:35,459
so they can make it's about the money

418
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:37,860

434
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:11,400
missed days of work because I'm not

435
00:17:09,419 --> 00:17:14,640
getting sick anymore the investment in

436
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:17,400
the supplements is a no-brainer I see

437
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:19,620
people go out and they go into Whole

438
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,819
Foods and they go into all the different

439
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:22,980
stores

440
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:26,160

beginning of the show I wasn't at all I

483
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:07,400

00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:14,640
bummer

00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:17,760
out there I'm putting some honey in here

488
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:20,100
now this product is really

489
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:22,020
high in antioxidants because it's

490
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:23,460

00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,960
in here

498
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:42,419
smell

499
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:44,400
moving the needle that's what I like I

500
00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:47,340
like everything that moves the needle

501
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,720
that's what mm info so I'm making the

502
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:51,419
medical medium

503
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:54,299
vitamin C shock therapy is what I'm

504
00:19:51,419 --> 00:19:57,240
making I put two capsules

505
00:19:54,299 --> 00:20:01,580
right there I put a little bit of honey

506
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:01,580
now let's cut an orange open

507
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:11,120
now Spirit of compassion created

508
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:11,120
this vitamin C shock therapy

509
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:16,620
and there's reasons why

510
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:19,740
the Orange is in there which is just

511
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:21,299
amazing now this is the micro C it's

512
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:23,760
buffered

513
00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:25,500
the problem is with vitamin C's out

514
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:29,940
there

515
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:31,919
is they are like straight acid

516
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:33,840
ascorbic acid

517
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,700
I'm sorry

518
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,740
but I can't tell you how many people

519
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:39,360
show vitamin C's in my face

520
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:42,120
and I'm like

521
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,919
no way in hell I don't want to burn a

522
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:47,460
hole through my stomach I don't want

523
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:49,860
straight ascorbic acid and I see it all

524
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:52,320
the time I got friends I got people that

525
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:54,179
will like contact me and be like

526
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,280
you know I'm on the road this is the

527
00:20:54,179 --> 00:20:57,660
only thing I could find right now and

528
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:59,220
I'm like yeah and you're gonna burn a

529
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:01,620
hole right right in your stomach without

530
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:04,500
a straight ascorbic acid

531
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:07,919
so what I love about the micro C it's

532
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:10,500
not it's not that ascorbic acid

533
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:12,299
right and that's a big deal all on its

534
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:14,100
own anyway

535
00:21:12,299 --> 00:21:15,660
what I did is just I put a little honey

536
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:18,240
in here I squeezed some orange in here

537
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:20,760
got some warm water I put two capsules

538
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:23,059
of the micro seed in here and I'm mixing

539
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,059
it up

540
00:21:24,299 --> 00:21:30,900

00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:52,080
can put it in whatever hand you want to

551
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:53,460
put it in right I'll put it in my right

552
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:57,679
hand right now

553
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:57,679
and put your hand on top of your head

554
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:01,520
and you make that continuity happen

555
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,980
it goes right from the supplement that's

556
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:08,940
in your hand

557
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:11,580
right up to the brain and back down

558
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:13,559
so and I saw somebody doing it who

559
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:15,720
posted about it just recently when they

560
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:18,600
saw me do it right and they did it

561
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:19,980
and they were describing how they felt

562
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,539
when it's a product that's actually

563
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:23,640
really pure

564
00:22:21,539 --> 00:22:25,020
and the intentions are pure and that's a

565
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:26,880
whole other aspect of it so the

566
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:28,919
continuity test is not just about the

567
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,780
product being pure which with bimbridge

568
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:33,059
that's that's how incredible they are

569
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:35,280
right but it's also the intentions that

570
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:37,620
are in the product it's about the care

571
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:39,240
it's about the love it's about loving

572
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:41,400
and caring enough to pick the highest

573
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:43,260
quality it's about loving and caring

574
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:45,360
enough not to put garbage in it and it's

575
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:48,780
about the love and caring enough to make

576
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:52,080
sure that all that is is there

577
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:54,120
and so it's the intention too that

578
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:56,220
continuity test is involved with not

579
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:58,740
just the quality of the product as well

580
00:22:56,220 --> 00:23:00,480
it's both and that's what you would

581
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:02,100
really really connect to which is really

582
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,559
exciting

583
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:06,360

I told you guys we talked about this one

618
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:36,720
time right here's what I do

619
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:39,299
I envision

620
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:41,580
I'm seeing my white blood cells

621
00:24:39,299 --> 00:24:43,080
I Envision I see them

622
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:44,520
when you have a product like this

623
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:47,760
incredible

624
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:50,640
and that pure and the quality and the

625
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:53,100
design when you have that type of

626
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:55,380
product right that type of vitamin C

627
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:56,159
entering the vitamin C is for the immune

628
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:59,820
system

629
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:02,640
okay it's an antioxidant too so

630
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:06,120
what I do is I envision

631
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:10,700
seeing my white blood cells and as I'm

632
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:10,700
relaxing and taking in that vitamin C

633
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:15,480
and I saw that vitamin C now vitamin C

634
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:17,940
is entering my body

635
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:21,419
it's entering my bloodstream I see my

636
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:24,480
white blood cells going to gobble up and

637
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:26,039
consume that vitamin C because that's

638
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:29,700
what I see

639
00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:32,520
and that's a real powerful way to do it

640
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:35,220
but when you have something so pure and

641
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:37,260
so incredible in the quality

642
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:39,960
like democracy which is my favorite

643
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:42,480
vitamin C in the world before they had a

644
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:45,419
vitamin C I would have to be like a

645
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:47,700
prisoner to other vitamin C's I'd have

646
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:49,500
to do the ascorbic acid I'd have to do

647
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:51,960
because you you're trying to get a

648
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:54,659
vitamin C out there how to be a prisoner

649
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:55,679
and it was like Freedom it was like

650
00:25:54,659 --> 00:25:57,000
freedom

651
00:25:55,679 --> 00:26:00,419
so in beverage you came out through

652
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:02,100
micro C I was like free I'm free it was

653
00:26:00,419 --> 00:26:04,200
like unbelievable when you think about

654
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:06,000
it because it's like are you kidding I'm

655
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:08,640
free from all the garbage vitamin C's

656
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,500
like you guys just freed me like this

657
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,240
mom-and-pop company freed me and that's

658
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:14,159
what it was and it was unbelievable so

659
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:16,080
anyway what I do is when I'm sipping the

660
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:18,000
vitamin C

661
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:20,700
I'm envisioning the white blood cell

662
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,340
gobbling up that microc

663
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:25,440
and then getting stronger because it's

664
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:28,559
feeding off of it

665
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:32,340
my immune cells are actually eating that

666
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:35,340
vitamin C up gobbling it up eating that

667
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:36,960
vitamin C up and that's what I see I see

668
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:40,260
it I Envision it

669
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:42,840
I watch it I got my eyes closed and I'm

670
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:44,880
singing it so that's what I do what I'll

671
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:47,279
do is I'll have this at night before

672
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,840
going to bed and I'll do that because I

673
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:51,480
want my immune system be strong while

674
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:54,419
I'm sleeping and I say go at it white

675
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:56,640
blood cells get going get moving on it

676
00:26:54,419 --> 00:26:58,559
start eating up all that vitamin C I'll

677
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,000
take another zip

678
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:02,400
um

679
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,620
and there it goes and I can see it and

680
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:07,100
that's Envision it that's a powerful

681
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:10,860
technique a powerful tool all on its own

682
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:12,600
is actually having that consciousness of

683
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:14,840
Consciousness your soul your physical

684
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:16,620
brain all working together

685
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:19,919
witnessing

686
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:21,539
that vitamin C going down into your body

687
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:24,299
then witnessing

688
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:28,559
it going into your bloodstream

689
00:27:24,299 --> 00:27:30,179
and then validating and witnessing your

690
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:32,640
white blood cells that are working for

691
00:27:30,179 --> 00:27:36,299
you as your white blood cells gobble up

692
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:38,880
and feed off of that micro C it's about

693
00:27:36,299 --> 00:27:40,980
validating your white blood cells it's

694
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:43,440

doing and all that they're doing for you

696
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:49,620

people don't know the history of the

703
00:28:03,059 --> 00:28:06,360
supplements and how bad the quality is

704
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:07,860

709
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:19,679
don't know how companies are created

710
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:21,179
they don't know how it's done they don't

711
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:23,580
know about the manufacturing facilities

712
00:28:21,179 --> 00:28:25,500
with all their low quality techniques

713
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:27,779
and low quality products they don't know

714
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:30,179
about any of that and they're not

715
00:28:27,779 --> 00:28:33,659

717
00:28:33,659 --> 00:28:39,179

718
00:28:35,059 --> 00:28:42,600

720
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:47,580

721
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:49,260

723
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:52,260
amazing

724
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,700
you guys that's why I'm so excited about

725
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:55,860
the Vim machine because I use it for

726
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:58,320
myself my friends my family and I don't

727
00:28:55,860 --> 00:29:01,740
want this stuff to disappear so I fully

728
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:04,740
endorsed them 100 and yes I want to

729
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:07,260
support them in any way I can

730
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:10,559
because when you do things like this

731
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:13,260
when you create products like this it's

732
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:16,620
a game changer but it's for real though

733
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:19,740
real and the quality is unmatched all

734
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:22,260
right so talk about the propolis first

735
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:23,760
of all I love all these out here right

736
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:25,559
I love them all

737
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:27,299
you know there's something something

738
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:29,820
about when the micro C goes in you gotta

739
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:32,039
start laughing I start giggling I start

740
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:34,320
fooling around more it's really funny

741
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:36,480
I keep these supplements on hand for my

742
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:38,100
immune system during cold and flu I

743
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,020
don't want a cold and flu I don't want

744
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:42,539
to be held back from working I don't

745
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:46,260
want to be beaten down I run my immune

746
00:29:42,539 --> 00:29:48,419
system drag it so I want to keep feeding

747
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:51,059
it and keep it strong I want my bone

748
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:52,919
marrow to produce more really powerful

749
00:29:51,059 --> 00:29:56,940
immune cells I want them to have what

750
00:29:52,919 --> 00:30:00,240
they need and because I burn my like

751
00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:03,539
candle at four ends and I mean it's

752
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:05,880
amazing what I've done and what I do

753
00:30:03,539 --> 00:30:07,679
and when I think about it and I don't

754
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:09,240
recommend anybody doing it that way I

755
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:11,279
don't recommend working seven days a

756
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:13,380
week year after year after year for

757
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:15,899
years for decades and then you don't

758
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:18,720
stop I don't recommend that I think it's

759
00:30:15,899 --> 00:30:21,179
kind of probably not smart but I do it

760
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:24,240
anyway okay

761
00:30:21,179 --> 00:30:24,240
um okay

762
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:28,500
I got a news flash for you guys a news

763
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:30,539
flash I just have to say it I can't help

764
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:32,399
it I gotta speak my mind it's a news

765
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:35,760
flash

766
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:40,080
medical medium information never

767
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:42,360
ripped down vegans and never ripped down

768
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:44,700
you know vegans for being vegan meaning

769
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:46,080
and never ripped down animal protein

770
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:48,419
eaters

771
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:50,100
medical medium information is for animal

772
00:30:48,419 --> 00:30:52,799
protein eaters

773
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:54,360
and vegans

774
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:55,740
it's for people who don't eat animal

775
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:58,020
protein and people who eat animal

776
00:30:55,740 --> 00:31:01,020
protein but yet you'll see it every day

777
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:03,720
someone come out and be like oh I don't

778
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:06,539
I don't really I only trust some of

779
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:10,020
medical beams information because you

780
00:31:06,539 --> 00:31:12,240
know he's he says it's all vegan you got

781
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:14,399
to be vegan when the hell have I ever

782
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:17,179
said it's all vegan it has to be vegan

783
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:17,179
and only vegan

784
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:22,200
the reason why the vegan Community some

785
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:25,080
of the vegan Community like some of the

786
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:28,080
big vegan influencers hate medical

787
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:31,020
medium is because I let people eat

788
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:33,059
animal protein because I'm not an

789
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:35,640
ideologue on animal you know against

790
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:37,140
animal protein

791
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:39,659
medical medium information actually

792
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:41,940
gives options for everyone that's the

793
00:31:39,659 --> 00:31:44,340
whole point if you're an animal protein

794
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:46,860
person I show you how you can use tools

795
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:48,779
to heal while eating animal protein if

796
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:51,120
you're a vegan person I show you the

797
00:31:48,779 --> 00:31:53,580
same and vegans don't do it right out

798
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:56,059
there they don't you can be vegan for 20

799
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:59,039
years and stay sick

800
00:31:56,059 --> 00:32:01,559
so you can and and still need the tools

801
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:03,419
you need but I see it every time someone

802
00:32:01,559 --> 00:32:06,899
will do a post and start ripping into

803
00:32:03,419 --> 00:32:09,480
medical medium and his vegan vegan vegan

804
00:32:06,899 --> 00:32:12,240
whatever and meanwhile the vegan doctors

805
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:14,700
hate medical medium because

806
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,559
I allow people to have protein animal

807
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:19,620
protein if they like because I support

808
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:22,380
all and that angers the vegan the vegan

809
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:24,600
upper echelons it angers them so much

810
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:27,360
because they're all about you're an evil

811
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:29,640
person if you even like animal protein

812
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:31,320
uh you're an evil person about like

813
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:33,659
that's how they are so they hate medical

814
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:35,520
meeting because I want people to have

815
00:32:33,659 --> 00:32:36,899
the tools to heal and to know why

816
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:39,779
they're sick and they can still do

817
00:32:36,899 --> 00:32:41,399
animal protein if they want and vvv and

818
00:32:39,779 --> 00:32:44,159
if they want

819
00:32:41,399 --> 00:32:46,200
John boyntonat says people bring their

820
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:47,520
own perceptions and Concepts when they

821
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:50,700
first learn about medical medium

822
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:53,159
information do they ever do they ever

823
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:56,179
it is unbelievable

824
00:32:53,159 --> 00:32:56,179
it is unbelievable

825
00:32:57,059 --> 00:33:01,320
it really is

826
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:03,720
all right so

827
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:06,200
back to this back to what we're talking

828
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:09,419
about that was my news flash

829
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:11,039
okay and I mean quite honestly you guys

830
00:33:09,419 --> 00:33:13,320
I mean seriously

831
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:15,960
uh if one more person pops out of the

832
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:16,980
blue and just says you know I just the

833
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,480
thing is about medical medium

834
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:21,419
information is

835
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:23,399
it's it's the one thing out there that

836
00:33:21,419 --> 00:33:27,419
gets just hit all the time like we just

837
00:33:23,399 --> 00:33:29,760
get we get bashed and battered by miss

838
00:33:27,419 --> 00:33:31,500
you know people that don't have it right

839
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:33,120
they just don't even understand what mm

840
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:34,919
info is doesn't know about the books

841
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:37,919
don't never read the books don't know

842
00:33:34,919 --> 00:33:40,320
about the tools it's crazy if you read

843
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:41,580
brain saver books you'll learn how

844
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:43,559
people's neurons have trouble

845
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:45,000
understanding information and I see that

846
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:47,640
happen too you've got all these people

847
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,899
with all these neuron problems and they

848
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:50,700
don't really even know what's going on

849
00:33:48,899 --> 00:33:51,899
so they instantly have this emotional

850
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:54,000
Outburst of

851
00:33:51,899 --> 00:33:55,380
he's just a vegan and that's what he is

852
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,399
he doesn't know any and whatever it's

853
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:57,919
like okay

854
00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:00,960
um

855
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:02,640
dude medical medium info I've always

856
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,740
been supportive animal protein people

857
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:08,280
and vegans are like whatever

858
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:11,639
it's a bad game out there

859
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:14,220
um yeah up telephone

860
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:16,440
is what it is all right so anyway I'm

861
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:19,980
talking about the propolis

862
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:22,320
I can't say enough about the propolis

863
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:24,000
I really can't say enough about it you

864
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:26,940
see that Liquid Gold

865
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,379
it's unbelievable right

866
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:30,780
okay

867
00:34:28,379 --> 00:34:33,240
when it's got that active quercetin

868
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:36,060
inside of it

869
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:38,099
it's it's from B's screen from like a

870
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:40,320
certain amount of beekeepers really

871
00:34:38,099 --> 00:34:42,899
incredible on its own

872
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:44,820
free goes from someone someone's neurons

873
00:34:42,899 --> 00:34:48,179
even if you read brain saver you'll hear

874
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:50,460
it like you'll hear a story

875
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:52,500
out there but that story already went

876
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:54,720
through somebody's kind of like messed

877
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:56,159
up neurons contaminated neurons and then

878
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:58,080
went to another person with their

879
00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:00,359
contaminated neurons and went to another

880
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:01,920
person and The Story Goes Around next

881
00:35:00,359 --> 00:35:03,660
thing you know the story by the end of

882
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:05,339
it is completely different than what it

883
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:07,859
was at the beginning

884
00:35:05,339 --> 00:35:10,820
I'm going to put a two dropper folds of

885
00:35:07,859 --> 00:35:10,820
this propolis in here

886
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:14,960
there's no alcohol in here

887
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:19,079
the extracted extraction process is like

888
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:20,520
no other too

889
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:23,280
like

890
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:26,460
there's no propolis like this hands down

891
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:29,480
when you guys try this

892
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:29,480
this is

893
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:32,240
like

894
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:36,440
if someone said look

895
00:35:36,839 --> 00:35:41,700
someone said

896
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:43,920
I'll give you I'll match the weight of

897
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:47,460
this with gold with a little bit of gold

898
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:50,220
say no no keep keep the gold

899
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:52,740
no way keep the gold I mean that's how

900
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:55,320
much I love the propolis and what and

901
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:56,579
and the quality and everything about it

902
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:58,560
and the thing is here's what's crazy

903
00:35:56,579 --> 00:36:01,800
people don't realize

904
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:05,460
how good for the immune system propolis

905
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:09,180
really is they just don't know out there

906
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:11,520

buy all the propolis out there and

910
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:21,839
compare it to the vimergy and you will

911
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:23,339
be blown away at the very G propolis

912
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:25,859
like you can buy all the propolis you

913
00:36:23,339 --> 00:36:28,260
want out there and try to compare it to

914
00:36:25,859 --> 00:36:30,839
the memory propolis and you will be like

915
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:33,420
oh my God like what is this people are

916
00:36:30,839 --> 00:36:35,579

it's just it's just incredible yeah no

918
00:36:35,579 --> 00:36:39,900
it's Liquid Gold by far so I put two

919
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:41,460
dropper folds in there

920
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:43,560
okay

921
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:46,140
but yeah

922
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:48,060
it's got the six Active bioactive

923
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:51,780
polytheanols in there which is amazing

924
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:55,800
and the vermergy has up to 50 percent

925
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:58,260
of that which is like what who can say

926
00:36:55,800 --> 00:37:00,900
that and I've been wanting I've been

927
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:04,440
wanting a propolis to be like the real

928
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:08,579
thing forever forever I've had to be a

929
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:11,220
prisoner a slave to crappy propolis for

930
00:37:08,579 --> 00:37:14,160
so many decades like

931
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:16,320
like the worst kind and coming from the

932
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:20,400
worst places with the worst extraction

933
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:23,640
processes and the like the worst hidden

934
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:25,800
stuff in it and alcohol in it I've had

935
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:29,160
to been propylene glycol and other

936
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:31,079
alcohol I've had to be like a slave and

937
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:33,660
and then it's so hard because you got

938
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:35,880
Spirit of compassion telling you to be

939
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:39,000
like you know like a person needs

940
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:41,640
propolis a person needs this a person

941
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,859
needs that and then but yet I'm telling

942
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:47,760
Spirit of compassion but I'm a slave

943
00:37:43,859 --> 00:37:50,220
literally to this shittiest propolis to

944
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:52,020
the crappiest propolis out there to the

945
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:53,700
whatever and it's been torture for me

946
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:55,079
you guys hear me crying today because

947
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:57,420
I'm like crying is that okay okay

948
00:37:55,079 --> 00:38:00,359
because I'm doing a lot of crying right

949
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:02,880
but it's what my life has been

950
00:38:00,359 --> 00:38:03,720
look a lot of people say oh yeah you

951
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,000
know

952
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:07,380
that aw

953
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,839
uh I'd love to hang out with him and

954
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:11,700
talk shop with him you know that would

955
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:14,339
be amazing you know what you would hear

956
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:16,980
you would hear me saying this right here

957
00:38:14,339 --> 00:38:19,020
it's like literally I have like gone

958
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:20,820
through hell and back with the crap out

959
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:23,520
there you got spiritual compassion

960
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:26,400
saying they need propolis

961
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:28,260
the people need that and then me saying

962
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,660
but there's nothing but out there

963
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:33,359
Spirit of compassion and then he says

964
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:34,560
can you watch your swears but the point

965
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:38,040
is

966
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:41,280
is that that's what it's been like so

967
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:43,140
when Bemidji decided to change the rules

968
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:45,540
with propolis because that's what they

969
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:49,920
did they changed the rules

970
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:52,200
it's like a Hallelujah moment

971
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:53,640
it's like an amen moment

972
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:55,140
when you taste his propolis you'll

973
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:58,200
instantly know the difference and I'm

974
00:38:55,140 --> 00:39:00,480
going to do the continuity test right

975
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:02,760
and you know what's incredible you'll

976
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:04,800
notice with the propolis when you do the

977
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:06,300
continuity test

978
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:09,000
remember this isn't Kinesiology

979
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:12,119
Kinesiology is somebody else's free will

980
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:13,160
it's somebody else's free will you you

981
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:16,500
you

982
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:18,780
submit your own free will your free will

983
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:20,880
is completely canceled out I'm not

984
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:22,200
saying anything bad about Kinesiology or

985
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,660
muscle testing I'm not so I don't want

986
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:27,000
any I got enough people

987
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:29,280
that hate me for everything for for

988
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:32,099
telling all the truth for all the truth

989
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:34,380
bombs I got enough people that freaking

990
00:39:32,099 --> 00:39:36,000
hate me and whatever because of all the

991
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:38,880
truth bombs

992
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,619
right the apple cider vinegar crowd the

993
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:42,839
Ayahuasca crowd just everybody hates me

994
00:39:40,619 --> 00:39:44,099
the caffeine crowd whatever just you

995
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:45,540
know the whole bit right because it's

996
00:39:44,099 --> 00:39:47,520
all about money money money out there

997
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:49,680
right and so

998
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:51,480
you know the copper vessel crowd you

999
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:53,820
know the copper vessel crowd like copper

1000
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:55,079
copper drinking container crap they hate

1001
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:56,880
me because you know you get copper

1002
00:39:55,079 --> 00:39:58,680
poisoning from those things but the

1003
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:01,320
point is I got enough I put out all the

1004
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:02,760
truth bombs constantly

1005
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:04,260
and it's just

1006
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:05,880
chill yeah remember she's having a sale

1007
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:08,820
right now

1008
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:11,220
but it's like it's just you know you

1009
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:13,619
constantly put out the information and

1010
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:15,359
you just get bashed for it right that's

1011
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:16,740
what you do you get bashed for it so I'm

1012
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:18,000
not trying to I'm not ripping apart

1013
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:19,500
kinesiologists we have a lot of

1014
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Kinesiology people that actually love

1015
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,020
medical medium stuff if they're out

1016
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,880
there in the community so I'm not

1017
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:27,420
ripping apart Kinesiology or muscle

1018
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:29,280
testing I'm not I'm just saying that

1019
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:32,040
this continuity test Spirit of

1020
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:35,460
compassion taught me is not Kinesiology

1021
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:39,119
because you're using your own free will

1022
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:41,339
you're not submitting your free will

1023
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:42,900
or your soul or anything else for

1024
00:40:41,339 --> 00:40:44,940
somebody else's free will to do your

1025
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:46,440
Kinesiology right you're doing your own

1026
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:49,020
there's a big difference right here so

1027
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:52,320
the continuity test is really powerful

1028
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:54,060
your main lining the energy from the

1029
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:56,700
product through your arm to the other

1030
00:40:54,060 --> 00:41:00,119
arm into the brain and the brain is

1031
00:40:56,700 --> 00:41:01,680
sending it back to your hand

1032
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:03,540
and you're doing with your own free will

1033
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:05,040
and that's the difference when you deal

1034
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:06,540
with the propolis it's like oh my God

1035
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:08,339
anyway

1036
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:10,380

00:43:29,819 --> 00:43:36,200
every time I use the propolis every time

1100
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:36,200
I use it

1101
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:44,579
I train myself to connect with my immune

1102
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:48,020
cells and it goes in like that right

1103
00:43:44,579 --> 00:43:48,020
as the propolis is going in

1104
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:53,160
I instantly see my immune cells you can

1105
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:56,339
do that

1106
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:58,619
you can wire yourself to connect to your

1107
00:43:56,339 --> 00:44:00,780
immune system constantly

1108
00:43:58,619 --> 00:44:03,260
and that's what I do so every time I

1109
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:03,260
take a sip

1110
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:08,220
I see my immune cells

1111
00:44:06,359 --> 00:44:09,660
and that's what I do

1112
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:11,819
two of my favorite supplements is

1113
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:14,579
support through cold and flu is cat's

1114
00:44:11,819 --> 00:44:17,339
claw and Goldenseal

1115
00:44:14,579 --> 00:44:19,260
where's my that's my B12 that's my

1116
00:44:17,339 --> 00:44:21,480
golden seal right there Goldenseal I

1117
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:24,000
always say speaks for itself

1118
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:26,640
it does not need an intro it does not

1119
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:29,339
need a whole explanation it doesn't need

1120
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:31,040
anything it just needs one word and one

1121
00:44:29,339 --> 00:44:34,020
one word only

1122
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:35,760
Goldenseal that's what it needs it

1123
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:37,800
doesn't need any more than that

1124
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:40,680
and that's what I love about Goldenseal

1125
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:43,859
because the plant itself

1126
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:45,720
the plant itself the identity of the

1127
00:44:43,859 --> 00:44:47,460
plant if you know herbs

1128
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:49,200
I've been taught about herbs from Spirit

1129
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:52,200
of compassion I spent a lot of time in

1130
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:54,359
the field and just out there in nature

1131
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:56,400

1132
00:44:54,359 --> 00:44:58,859
Goldenseal

1133
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:03,000

Goldenseal needs nothing else

1137
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:11,460
it just doesn't if anything it's got to

1138
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:14,460

1164
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:19,140
talk about the cat's claw

1165
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:20,880
where is my cat's ball here it is

1166
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:22,859
I'm in the golden sea I'm gonna pop in

1167
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:24,780
here is what I'm gonna do

1168
00:46:22,859 --> 00:46:27,000
all right here we are

1169
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:28,800
this is like I'm trying to find

1170
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,060
everything here we go I'm gonna put a

1171
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:32,540
little golden seal in here if you guys

1172
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:32,540
don't mind

1173
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:39,420
I am liking this shot

1174
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:41,160
very much I have some zinc in there I

1175
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:42,960
got some golden seal in there I got some

1176
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:45,680
propolis in there now I'm gonna put some

1177
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:50,359
cats call in there

1178
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:50,359
very good cats go up

1179
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:57,839
now I'm not trying to brag or boast or

1180
00:46:55,680 --> 00:47:00,000
anything

1181
00:46:57,839 --> 00:47:01,680
but cat's claw

1182
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,540
is out there

1183
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:05,940
because of the hard work from Spirit of

1184
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:09,900
compassion

1185
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:12,060
uh pushing me to teach about it for over

1186
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:13,740
35 years

1187
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:16,319
so it became something in the

1188
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:19,859
Alternative Health movement

1189
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:22,200
so and I'm not trying to brag or boast

1190
00:47:19,859 --> 00:47:23,700
but cat's claw so if you see cat's claw

1191
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:26,400
talked about out there you see cats go

1192
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:28,200
out there you're a welcome you're

1193
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:30,300
welcome you're welcome

1194
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:32,220
he used to be the only

1195
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:34,740
um it used to be the only in dried form

1196
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:36,060
like in dried form and then the cat's

1197
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:39,540
claw that you would find out there in

1198
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:41,339
supplement form I was a slave too if I

1199
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:44,400
wanted it in a supplement form and it

1200
00:47:41,339 --> 00:47:46,200
was always low quality always it started

1201
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:48,180
out where it was only in capsules and

1202
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:51,119
then it was in alcohol tinctures with

1203
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:53,700
alcohol like I can't tell you like the

1204
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:55,859
road to get to this point

1205
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:57,540
I I don't even know what to say like in

1206
00:47:55,859 --> 00:47:59,400
in cat's Claw is used for Lyme disease

1207
00:47:57,540 --> 00:48:02,520
because of medical medium information

1208
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:05,339
but the road with cat's claw has been an

1209
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:08,280
arduous long one okay so it started out

1210
00:48:05,339 --> 00:48:10,800
where the only way to get it was just a

1211
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:13,079
bulk dried herb right and it was hard to

1212
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:15,180
get a hold of a long time ago really

1213
00:48:13,079 --> 00:48:17,160
hard like I can't even tell you the

1214
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:19,980
process and what it took how to travel

1215
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:21,960
to get it to find inmate connections a

1216
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:24,359
long time ago to actually get it in my

1217
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:26,099
hand right and then to be able to help

1218
00:48:24,359 --> 00:48:28,740
people with it okay that's the first and

1219
00:48:26,099 --> 00:48:30,300
foremost then that road turned into some

1220
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:32,040
supplement company some low quality

1221
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:34,560
supplement companies out there now

1222
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:37,020
turning it into capsules that was the

1223
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:39,180
next aspect of it right but that was

1224
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:41,220
also a hard Road and that wasn't the

1225
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:43,859
answer and then some bad supplement

1226
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:46,140
companies put it in alcohol tincture so

1227
00:48:43,859 --> 00:48:47,760
they put it in an alcohol tincture and

1228
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:50,460
when they did that there was that

1229
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:52,920
arduous Road of trying to get like it's

1230
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:55,440
been torture so to actually have it in

1231
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:58,140
this form right now today in this

1232
00:48:55,440 --> 00:49:00,720
quality is just utterly insane when I

1233
00:48:58,140 --> 00:49:03,240
think about it so anyway

1234
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:05,780
it's just really special I'm gonna pop

1235
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:05,780

00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:41,880
nothing more annoying than getting that

1280
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:44,339
and it comes in and then it's like I

1281
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:46,140
want to be productive I want to get up

1282
00:50:44,339 --> 00:50:48,359
and work in the kitchen but I'm about to

1283
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:50,400
pass out you know I want to go and do

1284
00:50:48,359 --> 00:50:52,260
something I want to hop in the car and

1285
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:54,720
you're just you're so sick I just see

1286
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:56,760
people suffer from it it's awful I want

1287
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:59,400
to be helpful in any way I can let's

1288
00:50:56,760 --> 00:51:01,440
make some time water

1289
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:05,119
so I got some

1290
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:05,119
water here in front of me

1291
00:51:05,339 --> 00:51:11,160
all right it's in this jug

1292
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:14,220
how simple is this

1293
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:16,920
you take your hand

1294
00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:18,720
you find some time

1295
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:21,359
nice

1296
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:23,300
you take that time and you pop it in

1297
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:25,980
here

1298
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:28,200
I like simple

1299
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:30,599
simple but powerful

1300
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:33,780
the recipe is in the cold and flu free

1301
00:51:30,599 --> 00:51:36,180
toolkit medicalmedium.com download it so

1302
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:38,700
you have it how incredible print it out

1303
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:41,099
is what I recommend

1304
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:43,319
I have time inside this water this water

1305
00:51:41,099 --> 00:51:45,660
can go anywhere it can sit here all day

1306
00:51:43,319 --> 00:51:48,140
with it in there it can be also in the

1307
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:48,140
refrigerator

1308
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:54,540
when you're using this

1309
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:56,460
you can pour it in

1310
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:58,740
something

1311
00:51:56,460 --> 00:52:00,240
right

1312
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:02,099
and then you can add a little bit of

1313
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:04,859
lemon if you really want to you can add

1314
00:52:02,099 --> 00:52:06,900
a little bit of lemon or lime a little

1315
00:52:04,859 --> 00:52:09,119
bit of honey if you want to you don't

1316
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:11,520
have to have it as plain time water but

1317
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:13,079
I like it plain in here a lot because

1318
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:15,119
that's what I'll do is put in here the

1319
00:52:13,079 --> 00:52:16,800
recipes in in the tool kit and then you

1320
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:20,220
have it sitting but that's incredible

1321
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:24,540
all in its own now time is a powerful

1322
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:27,359
tool no question for the immune system

1323
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:29,040
I don't care what anybody says it just

1324
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:30,720
is

1325
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:31,800
you know what's amazing about Spirit of

1326
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:35,460
compassion

1327
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:37,140
right the one piece of Freedom that I've

1328
00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:39,660
had throughout this torturous life of

1329
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:41,040
having to do what I have to do right the

1330
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:42,960
curse of hearing Spirit of compassion

1331
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:44,940
since I was age four the one thing

1332
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:46,920
that's really remarkable

1333
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:49,200
is it's information you don't hear

1334
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:50,640
anywhere else but I know here's what the

1335
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:52,680
here's the critics or the not the

1336
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:56,400
critics here's what the haters will do

1337
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:59,700
the haters right so if you say the word

1338
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:01,440
time they'll be like oh that's not

1339
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:04,200
original or unique because he said the

1340
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:06,599
word time he said that well time has

1341
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:08,339
been growing here but when you see

1342
00:53:06,599 --> 00:53:10,380
medical meme information on what time

1343
00:53:08,339 --> 00:53:13,079
does that's never been said anywhere

1344
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:16,260
else or you see in medical meme

1345
00:53:13,079 --> 00:53:18,059
information with celery juices what does

1346
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:20,099
where you can't find anywhere else

1347
00:53:18,059 --> 00:53:23,099
that's where it's like the freedom is

1348
00:53:20,099 --> 00:53:24,720
everywhere in the mm info the Freedom's

1349
00:53:23,099 --> 00:53:26,940
there it's all the original information

1350
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:29,280
that's just freeing people of their

1351
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:31,980
ailments it's amazing I release the info

1352
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:33,599
of these Deca about this decades ago too

1353
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:36,720
and a lot of people steal it so here's

1354
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:39,380
the thing just like the Mercury amalgos

1355
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:39,380
you guys

1356
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:46,619
in the 80s

1357
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:50,339
okay Mercury amalgams were like

1358
00:53:46,619 --> 00:53:51,839
being put in everybody without any any

1359
00:53:50,339 --> 00:53:53,400
opposition

1360
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:56,160
whatsoever

1361
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:58,680
I would go on like a tour

1362
00:53:56,160 --> 00:54:00,900
and go to dental I had a dentist friend

1363
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:03,540
really old guy he was like a 90 year old

1364
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:04,920
dentist he would take me to dentist

1365
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:07,980
conventions

1366
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:10,380
and literally I'd be the only one saying

1367
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:12,119
we can't do the Mercury anymore we can't

1368
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:14,400
do the Mercury anymore

1369
00:54:12,119 --> 00:54:16,859
they all just would look at me like are

1370
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:18,900
you insane and these were Advanced

1371
00:54:16,859 --> 00:54:20,520
people conventional and alternative it

1372
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:23,040
was like alternative and conventional

1373
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:26,220
people you know it was like the amount

1374
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:29,460
of work to get like the amalgams to stop

1375
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:32,280
going into people's Jaws it took it took

1376
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:34,020
years and years for it to spread and

1377
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:36,059
then teach about it and for it to spread

1378
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:38,579
and teach about it you know I say the

1379
00:54:36,059 --> 00:54:39,900
spirit of compassion if I didn't exist

1380
00:54:38,579 --> 00:54:42,180
right

1381
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:44,160
and I I wasn't fighting for The Chronic

1382
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:47,460
Leo all these decades going all the way

1383
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:49,440
back what would the landscape look like

1384
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:51,839
it would be unbelievable the difference

1385
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:54,000
would be insane actually

1386
00:54:51,839 --> 00:54:55,680
just like what you see happening today I

1387
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,780
put something new out brand new

1388
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:59,339
information from the books in the

1389
00:54:57,780 --> 00:55:01,559
podcast and the lives and then people

1390
00:54:59,339 --> 00:55:03,720
take it and don't cite it back and they

1391
00:55:01,559 --> 00:55:06,180
feel like it was out there already

1392
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:07,980
and it wasn't out there already they act

1393
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:09,300
like it was out there already and it

1394
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:11,579
wasn't

1395
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:14,400
anyway

1396
00:55:11,579 --> 00:55:16,200
woe is me but at the same time I'm

1397
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:18,800
crying the blues I'm going to sip a

1398
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:18,800
little bit more of this

1399
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:21,720
hurts other people is what it does

1400
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:23,280
because they can't find the information

1401
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:25,740
where it comes from and then they can't

1402
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:27,960
heal that's why the woe is me because

1403
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:31,940
then I my heart hurts for people

1404
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:31,940

00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:19,740
taking the info not citing it because

1424
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:22,800
when you leave this short life you do

1425
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:28,400
have to answer somewhere somehow for all

1426
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:28,400
the evil you have done it's like

1427
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:33,720
people think they don't have to answer

1428
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:35,700
it anyway whether it's in their own

1429
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:37,140
conscious mind or subconscious or Soul

1430
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:38,099
when they're leaving here you gotta

1431
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:41,819
answer

1432
00:56:38,099 --> 00:56:44,040
if you purposely were doing some nasty

1433
00:56:41,819 --> 00:56:46,079
crap to people like purposely like

1434
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:48,780
trying to rob millions of chronically

1435
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:51,480
ill people out of Answers by not citing

1436
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:53,339
back stuff purposely all that stuff it's

1437
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:54,660
just terrible and then ripping down

1438
00:56:53,339 --> 00:56:56,880
medical me at the same time you know

1439
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:59,819
what I mean Dr Sherry green Dr Sherry

1440
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:02,460

I'm honored you're here truly all

1442
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:06,660
threatened by your Advanced information

1443
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:09,780
because rather than embracing it they

1444
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:12,059
just want to be the one exactly instead

1445
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:13,859
of embracing that's Dr Sherry green and

1446
00:57:12,059 --> 00:57:15,420
so you're saying instead of embracing

1447
00:57:13,859 --> 00:57:19,440
the information of where it comes from

1448
00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:21,900
they'd rather be the one steal poach not

1449
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:24,000
cite back other people get hurt by that

1450
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:25,740
and then you got somebody to answer to

1451
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,300
or something to answer to you've got to

1452
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:29,700
answer to yourself or whatever when

1453
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:32,280
you're leaving here yeah and I feel bad

1454
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:34,440

compassion taught me that the first tip

1485
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:50,099
I take I see my white blood cells

1486
00:58:48,380 --> 00:58:53,460

I feel so special to have this knowledge

1492
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:08,819
I have a hard time with friends and

1493
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:11,099
family talking about medical medium

1494
00:59:08,819 --> 00:59:13,799
that's the burden the community does

1495
00:59:11,099 --> 00:59:16,440
hold it's really hard I will tell you

1496
00:59:13,799 --> 00:59:18,059
guys like seriously I mean I've talked

1497
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:19,740
about this with Spirit of compassion so

1498
00:59:18,059 --> 00:59:21,240
many times I said I just wish the

1499
00:59:19,740 --> 00:59:23,160
community didn't have to get so much

1500
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:26,099
pushback when they're talking about

1501
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:27,420
medical medium or anything else

1502
00:59:26,099 --> 00:59:29,880
uh

1503
00:59:27,420 --> 00:59:31,799
I totally understand Simian read the

1504
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:34,400
rest of your comment I gotta see if I

1505
00:59:31,799 --> 00:59:34,400
could find it again

1506
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:39,020
it was really good

1507
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:46,559
anyway so there it is I feel so special

1508
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,880
to have this knowledge I have a hard

1509
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:49,859
time with friends and family talking

1510
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:52,380
about medical medium they don't want to

1511
00:59:49,859 --> 00:59:55,020
hear it all because of where you get the

1512
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:57,000
information so grateful someone informed

1513
00:59:55,020 --> 00:59:59,640
me

1514
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:01,680
and here's the thing

1515
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:03,839
someone informed you right

1516
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:06,059
but in a way that's divine intervention

1517
01:00:03,839 --> 01:00:08,700
isn't it is it providential is divine

1518
01:00:06,059 --> 01:00:10,079
intervention is it spiritual forces is

1519
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:12,720
it

1520
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:14,400
is it all of the above is it Angelic is

1521
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:16,140
it Angels because Spirit of compassion

1522
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:18,299
always told me that the person who

1523
01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:20,880
receives who understands this

1524
01:00:18,299 --> 01:00:23,640
information in here whoever receives the

1525
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:26,640
word and and learns from it and and

1526
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:28,079
finds it it's it is spiritual

1527
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:30,180
intervention

1528
01:00:28,079 --> 01:00:34,559
from a Divine source

1529
01:00:30,180 --> 01:00:36,660
whether an angel had you find it

1530
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:40,260
and it's unbelievable when I think about

1531
01:00:36,660 --> 01:00:42,900
that or an angel shows you something and

1532
01:00:40,260 --> 01:00:44,700
then you're like what is this

1533
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:47,579
and you know what's crazy yet everyone

1534
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:49,680
out there is so spiritual but yet they

1535
01:00:47,579 --> 01:00:53,099
don't want to believe or something that

1536
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:55,440
all this these volumes of of

1537
01:00:53,099 --> 01:00:58,140
incredible advanced

1538
01:00:55,440 --> 01:01:00,059
a real Advanced information about way

1539
01:00:58,140 --> 01:01:01,859
ahead of science and research comes from

1540
01:01:00,059 --> 01:01:03,480
a voice I hear

1541
01:01:01,859 --> 01:01:06,720
or they'll be like well maybe he's a

1542
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:08,520
genius no I'm not a genius besides

1543
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:10,859
there's Geniuses out there and they

1544
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:12,780
can't even they can't even produce this

1545
01:01:10,859 --> 01:01:15,299
it's not possible

1546
01:01:12,780 --> 01:01:16,500
so and everybody's so spiritual they're

1547
01:01:15,299 --> 01:01:17,520
all going to yoga and they're all

1548
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:19,260
talking spiritual and they're all

1549
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:21,720
sitting around campfires

1550
01:01:19,260 --> 01:01:23,819
you know sucking down like

1551
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:25,619
yeah micro dosing mushrooms and sucking

1552
01:01:23,819 --> 01:01:27,480
down Ayahuasca and

1553
01:01:25,619 --> 01:01:29,460
smoking weed all day and talking about

1554
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:31,319
the universe and everybody's so

1555
01:01:29,460 --> 01:01:34,500
spiritual now they're also spiritual

1556
01:01:31,319 --> 01:01:36,420
everybody is like everybody now and but

1557
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:38,099
yet what it's hard to believe this or

1558
01:01:36,420 --> 01:01:40,079
something

1559
01:01:38,099 --> 01:01:42,839
you know you just open up the box and

1560
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:45,380
just see what's in here

1561
01:01:42,839 --> 01:01:45,380
really

1562
01:01:45,780 --> 01:01:50,099
or are they spiritual

1563
01:01:48,119 --> 01:01:51,540
that's the question are they really

1564
01:01:50,099 --> 01:01:53,880
spiritual

1565
01:01:51,540 --> 01:01:56,280
are they just posers

1566
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:57,960
acting like they're spiritual pretending

1567
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:59,460
they're spiritual or they think they're

1568
01:01:57,960 --> 01:02:01,700
spiritual but they're really not

1569
01:01:59,460 --> 01:02:04,859
spiritual because they're not even open

1570
01:02:01,700 --> 01:02:07,020
open-minded enough to know that this is

1571
01:02:04,859 --> 01:02:09,420
like incredible so

1572
01:02:07,020 --> 01:02:12,059
are they just posers Spirit of

1573
01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:16,020
compassion told me when I was younger

1574
01:02:12,059 --> 01:02:17,460
don't don't don't act spiritual I was

1575
01:02:16,020 --> 01:02:18,900
like I'm not

1576
01:02:17,460 --> 01:02:20,040
sure the company I said don't act

1577
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:22,440
spiritual

1578
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:24,299
don't just go around every second you

1579
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:26,339
know with like a robe on and just be

1580
01:02:24,299 --> 01:02:28,559
because you hear it can happen because

1581
01:02:26,339 --> 01:02:30,599
you hear you hear me Spirit of

1582
01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:33,660
compassion said and because you hear a

1583
01:02:30,599 --> 01:02:35,819
voice and you have this information it's

1584
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:38,099
easy to fall into that Spirit of

1585
01:02:35,819 --> 01:02:41,180
compassion said don't don't don't act

1586
01:02:38,099 --> 01:02:41,180
like a spiritual Guru

1587
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:45,000
don't I mean there's nothing wrong with

1588
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:47,640
praying hands there's nothing wrong with

1589
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:49,859
anything but it's very compassion said

1590
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:52,260
don't like

1591
01:02:49,859 --> 01:02:55,559
act like you walk on water or anything

1592
01:02:52,260 --> 01:02:57,299
like that I said I don't I just throw my

1593
01:02:55,559 --> 01:02:59,040
sloppy clothes on and I'm ready to just

1594
01:02:57,299 --> 01:03:01,980
deliver just give me the information so

1595
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:06,079

I need to get that information out there

1597
01:03:06,540 --> 01:03:10,680

1598
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:12,240
and all of that and I do the medical

1599
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:14,099
media meditations and I pray and

1600
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:16,859
everything but I don't mean by that I

1601
01:03:14,099 --> 01:03:19,859
mean by you know what I'm talking about

1602
01:03:16,859 --> 01:03:22,380
so anyway olive leaf right there is one

1603
01:03:19,859 --> 01:03:24,000
of my favorites but once again it's like

1604
01:03:22,380 --> 01:03:26,520
the same old story

1605
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:28,740
being a prisoner to the bad Olive Leafs

1606
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:31,559
out there to the ones in alcohol and the

1607
01:03:28,740 --> 01:03:34,500
ones in real bad you know glycerin the

01:03:36,420 --> 01:03:40,440
hidden ingredients is what I'm saying

1611
01:03:38,460 --> 01:03:41,819
like the hidden ingredients out there

1612
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:44,700
like being

1613
01:03:41,819 --> 01:03:46,380
a slave to bad Olive leaves that was

1614
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:47,880
something that was really hard so I love

1615
01:03:46,380 --> 01:03:51,020
that for the immune system too they all

1616
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:51,020

I mean that's incredible honestly I'm

1630
01:04:31,020 --> 01:04:34,079
hearing it all the time people are just

1631
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:35,700
coming down with colds and flus they're

1632
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:37,799
sick they got the sore throats they got

1633
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:40,079

the light blast is gonna happen so you

1677
01:06:09,839 --> 01:06:13,460
have to be on my newsletter so you can

1678
01:06:11,339 --> 01:06:16,200
find out when that light blast happens

1679
01:06:13,460 --> 01:06:18,920
and the light blast needs to be live

1680
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:21,960
replays don't work

1681
01:06:18,920 --> 01:06:23,220
their replays are meditative to listen

1682
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:25,980
to

1683
01:06:23,220 --> 01:06:29,400
and they're healing in other ways but

1684
01:06:25,980 --> 01:06:31,859
the replay is not the live light blast

1685
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:34,680
in the moment where Spirit of compassion

1686
01:06:31,859 --> 01:06:37,920
is sending down the light in that moment

1687
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:39,359
in real time live

1688
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:43,099

1689
01:06:39,359 --> 01:06:43,099
