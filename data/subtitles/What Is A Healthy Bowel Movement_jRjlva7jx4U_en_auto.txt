[34.40 - 37.36] of it until he talked about poop now i
[36.00 - 39.44] don't believe him at all i'm gonna
[37.36 - 41.24] unfollow him
[39.44 - 44.96] poop mania
[41.24 - 47.20] everybody gets jazzed up about poop they
[44.96 - 49.20] get jazzed up
[47.20 - 51.28] they get really upset
[49.20 - 52.80] and everything else around it and that's
[51.28 - 54.00] what happens but we're talking about
[52.80 - 54.88] poop and this is really important
[54.00 - 56.08] because
[54.88 - 58.00] we're going to talk about the digestive
[56.08 - 59.36] tract we're going to talk about how
[58.00 - 61.68] celery juice
[59.36 - 62.80] fixes your digestive tract
[61.68 - 64.56] yes
[62.80 - 65.92] helping you have healthier poops and
[64.56 - 67.92] we're going to talk about poops floating
[65.92 - 69.68] we're going to talk about poop sinking
[67.92 - 71.76] we're going to talk about what's bad
[69.68 - 73.84] about poop what's good about poop and
[71.76 - 76.56] what's crazy is you know you put some
[73.84 - 78.24] information out there right everybody's
[76.56 - 80.32] all throwing at you they're
[78.24 - 82.24] throwing poop at you they're so mad
[80.32 - 83.60] that's what's happening right
[82.24 - 86.24] and they all think their don't
[83.60 - 88.72] stink that's what's incredible every
[86.24 - 90.24] single person health professional i'm
[88.72 - 92.24] i've been a health professional for many
[90.24 - 95.60] years and that's opposite of what we
[92.24 - 98.00] have learned in medical school uh
[95.60 - 99.20] am i missing something because
[98.00 - 101.44] i thought
[99.20 - 103.12] it was well known by now
[101.44 - 105.20] that all the medical doctors that
[103.12 - 107.84] graduate from medical school never
[105.20 - 109.92] taught anything about like poop and food
[107.84 - 111.52] and things like that or anything about
[109.92 - 112.96] nutrition or anything isn't that what
[111.52 - 114.32] everybody knew all these years because i
[112.96 - 116.80] talked to a lot of doctors and everybody
[114.32 - 119.92] knows that so why is all of a sudden
[116.80 - 121.68] medical school the expert about poop
[119.92 - 123.12] it just doesn't make any sense so we're
[121.68 - 124.72] just going to cover a lot of little
[123.12 - 126.08] pieces about this this is going to be a
[124.72 - 127.28] good talk and probably really
[126.08 - 129.60] educational
[127.28 - 130.80] maybe fun hopefully
[129.60 - 132.64] but you know
[130.80 - 133.68] yeah everybody's an expert they just
[132.64 - 135.92] google
[133.68 - 138.40] yeah anthony's got to be wrong because i
[135.92 - 141.60] just google it and it says no he's wrong
[138.40 - 142.48] about poop look on google right
[141.60 - 144.88] and
[142.48 - 146.96] that's a funny one all on its own okay
[144.88 - 148.24] so let's go into this let's start
[146.96 - 150.16] talking about it we're talking about

[245.84 - 249.52] about them dr fong good to see you poop
[247.52 - 251.60] pep talk is what it is indeed i'm
[249.52 - 255.04] excited about this
[251.60 - 257.28] i was told by my doctor
[255.04 - 259.36] because doctors know everything right
[257.28 - 260.16] that's why people are dying people are
[259.36 - 261.68] sick
[260.16 - 263.44] people are bedridden
[261.68 - 265.12] right people have chronic illness a
[263.44 - 266.40] whole lifetime because doctors know
[265.12 - 268.32] everything right
[266.40 - 270.08] oh google knows everything just google
[268.32 - 272.00] it you could be fixed that's a good
[270.08 - 274.24] thing you could do if you're bedridden
[272.00 - 275.76] with a disease and you're suffering and
[274.24 - 278.00] no one can help you why don't you just
[275.76 - 280.00] google you'll be fixed tomorrow google
[278.00 - 281.44] will fix everything
[280.00 - 283.92] okay
[281.44 - 286.64] i was told by my doctor
[283.92 - 288.64] the absolute opposite statement with
[286.64 - 291.68] matter what medical medium said
[288.64 - 293.76] floating stool is a sign of not properly
[291.68 - 295.52] digesting fats
[293.76 - 298.00] think about the drops of oil in the
[295.52 - 301.12] water well
[298.00 - 304.40] here's how it works okay
[301.12 - 307.60] you want a little bit of almond butter
[304.40 - 310.48] which is a lot of fat in there right a
[307.60 - 311.84] lot of fat in that almond butter okay
[310.48 - 313.12] so let's get a little bit of almond
[311.84 - 315.28] butter here
[313.12 - 317.28] that almond butter should just float
[315.28 - 318.08] shouldn't it so let's get some water up
[317.28 - 319.92] here
[318.08 - 322.08] well that almond butter just should
[319.92 - 322.96] float to the top of the water shouldn't
[322.08 - 325.04] it
[322.96 - 326.48] right probably should float right to oh
[325.04 - 327.92] it sunk
[326.48 - 329.12] it's sunk
[327.92 - 330.72] huh
[329.12 - 332.64] seems like everybody knows what they're
[330.72 - 334.16] talking about including every single
[332.64 - 335.68] doctor i guess
[334.16 - 338.16] because they're saying it's supposed to
[335.68 - 340.16] float fat is supposed to float i'm
[338.16 - 342.32] scratching my head right now that's
[340.16 - 344.64] interesting why did that almond butter
[342.32 - 347.60] sink like lead huh
[344.64 - 349.52] all right let me put that away here
[347.60 - 350.64] let's take some peanut butter how about
[349.52 - 353.44] that
[350.64 - 354.24] peanut butter really high in fat that's
[353.44 - 356.64] right
[354.24 - 358.56] you eat a tub of peanut butter every day
[356.64 - 360.80] you're going to get fat you're going to
[358.56 - 362.48] get fat real fast right
[360.80 - 364.00] so i'm going to get some peanut butter
[362.48 - 366.32] here right
[364.00 - 369.52] let's get a little peanut butter here i
[366.32 - 371.36] got some water in this cup okay
[369.52 - 373.92] so let's put some peanut butter in here
[371.36 - 375.36] now that peanut butter should float
[373.92 - 377.20] right
[375.36 - 378.56] why that peanut butter sink
[377.20 - 381.44] i am so
[378.56 - 382.32] darn confused everybody's telling me
[381.44 - 383.68] that
[382.32 - 384.80] wait a minute everybody's telling me
[383.68 - 387.44] that
[384.80 - 387.44] a poop
[387.52 - 390.88] that floats
[389.04 - 393.68] or mid-floats
[390.88 - 395.04] means it's all fat and that's why it's
[393.68 - 397.44] floating
[395.04 - 399.68] scratching my head right here let me do
[397.44 - 402.24] some tahini how about that
[399.68 - 405.04] uh-huh let's do that
[402.24 - 406.88] and this is why you shouldn't talk to aw
[405.04 - 408.24] or you shouldn't listen to aw just
[406.88 - 409.92] because millions of people have healed
[408.24 - 412.56] with his books that never had a chance
[409.92 - 414.88] to heal oh don't listen to him listen to
[412.56 - 417.20] some dietitian right listen to a
[414.88 - 419.04] dietitian about poop right dietitian
[417.20 - 421.20] knows everything about poop here's some
[419.04 - 422.80] tahini here right
[421.20 - 424.96] tahini
[422.80 - 426.96] with a lot of oil on it
[424.96 - 429.68] whoa
[426.96 - 432.40] that tahini had so much oil it was
[429.68 - 434.48] soaking in oil
[432.40 - 438.40] that's what that tahini was doing but
[434.48 - 440.40] why did it sink i'm really confused here
[438.40 - 442.48] this is really interesting so let me put
[440.40 - 443.76] this tahini back right
[442.48 - 446.24] let me put this
[443.76 - 447.92] almonds are high in fat too
[446.24 - 451.36] i think i'm going to do something else
[447.92 - 454.32] here let me get some water here
[451.36 - 454.32] get a little bit of this
[454.64 - 458.24] and
[455.84 - 460.64] i'm going to put some water right here
[458.24 - 461.84] so you guys don't mind
[460.64 - 462.96] okay
[461.84 - 464.72] and
[462.96 - 466.00] oh chocolate
[464.72 - 469.12] cacao
[466.00 - 471.52] cacao butter cacao fat
[469.12 - 472.96] it's a lot of fat in there
[471.52 - 474.88] what the hell
[472.96 - 477.20] how did chocolate sink
[474.88 - 479.68] how's that possible how's chocolate
[477.20 - 483.20] sinking i thought everybody was telling
[479.68 - 484.96] me that it's going to float to the top
[483.20 - 485.76] so that means if your poop is filled
[484.96 - 487.20] with
[485.76 - 489.04] with anything
[487.20 - 490.64] like any kind of fat it's going to float
[489.04 - 492.72] to the top well that's funny because
[490.64 - 495.52] guess what i talked to a lot of doctors
[492.72 - 497.76] that actually test fat levels in poop
[495.52 - 500.16] and they're all sinking poops
[497.76 - 502.80] yes because everybody's beat up
[500.16 - 504.96] digestion track screwed up digestive
[502.80 - 507.12] system weak livers wheat pancreases and
[504.96 - 508.88] everything else they can't break down
[507.12 - 510.88] all their fats
[508.88 - 513.04] so their fats end up in their stools
[510.88 - 514.72] every day everybody out there on keto
[513.04 - 517.84] diets or anywhere else and when they do
[514.72 - 519.84] an actual fat exam on that stool they
[517.84 - 521.92] find a lot of fat in that stool that's
[519.84 - 523.92] undigested that's actually in the stool
[521.92 - 525.92] and guess where that stool is it's sunk
[523.92 - 528.48] at the bottom of the damn toilet and
[525.92 - 529.28] there it is the cacao sinks just like
[528.48 - 531.04] that
[529.28 - 534.24] cacao did right there hey let's do
[531.04 - 536.24] another one
[534.24 - 538.72] let's do another one right here okay
[536.24 - 541.52] because everybody's so smart out there
[538.72 - 543.28] everybody's so smart oh
[541.52 - 545.36] why are these almonds why are they
[543.28 - 547.04] sinking to the bottom of that bowl well
[545.36 - 548.48] almonds are sinking down to the bottom
[547.04 - 550.72] of that bowl right there
[548.48 - 552.32] right there they are sinking down to the
[550.72 - 554.24] bottom of that bowl
[552.32 - 556.00] right there all sitting at the bottom
[554.24 - 556.80] right now there you go
[556.00 - 558.32] right
[556.80 - 560.32] all those almonds are sitting down at
[558.32 - 563.28] the bottom of that bowl so let's put
[560.32 - 566.80] that there now wait a minute let me get
[563.28 - 567.92] some cashews in here you like cashews
[566.80 - 569.20] huh
[567.92 - 571.84] cashews
[569.20 - 573.12] oh cashews are cranking high in fat
[571.84 - 574.80] there's no question i'm going to keep
[573.12 - 577.28] the cashews coming
[574.80 - 579.60] see what happens is our broken digestive
[577.28 - 582.40] tracts don't break down the fats and
[579.60 - 584.08] proteins and so our sinks to the
[582.40 - 586.00] bottom you see
[584.08 - 587.52] that's what happens i love how a
[586.00 - 588.64] thousand comments telling me that i
[587.52 - 590.24] don't know what i'm talking about
[588.64 - 591.60] because google says different well

[677.12 - 682.80] they're dying of all kinds of diseases
[679.84 - 684.64] across the gamma
[682.80 - 687.12] and their
[684.64 - 687.12] sinks
[687.36 - 691.28] are you telling me they have a healthy
[691.28 - 695.76] even though they're dying
[693.36 - 698.48] their shit's healthy but they're dying
[695.76 - 701.96] i'm confused
[698.48 - 701.96] there are nurses
[702.40 - 707.36] helping patients go to bathroom every
[704.72 - 709.44] single day in every hospital around this
[707.36 - 713.68] country and globe and their is
[709.44 - 714.56] sinking to the bottom of that toilet
[713.68 - 717.12] so
[714.56 - 720.64] their stool is healthy
[717.12 - 724.00] so that dying person stools perfectly
[720.64 - 726.88] healthy because it's sunk to the bottom
[724.00 - 728.32] but they're going to be dead in 10 days
[726.88 - 730.40] from some kind of disease in the
[728.32 - 733.28] hospital
[730.40 - 735.04] that person's stool is so healthy at the
[733.28 - 736.72] bottom of their toilet let me just get
[735.04 - 738.64] their stool out of the bottom of that
[736.72 - 740.72] sick person's toilet that's dying in the
[738.64 - 742.00] hospital it's the healthiest stool there
[740.72 - 744.00] is
[742.00 - 745.44] and the person's got three four diseases
[744.00 - 748.48] and they're dying in the hospital right
[745.44 - 751.80] now across the world
[748.48 - 753.52] do you see how disturbingly
[751.80 - 754.96] ironically
[753.52 - 757.60] deranged
[754.96 - 759.36] people are in the health movement
[757.60 - 760.80] because they'll tell you
[759.36 - 763.44] i'm wrong
[760.80 - 764.96] because i'm saying a really healthy poop
[763.44 - 767.68] should mid float and i'm going to tell
[764.96 - 769.60] you why it should mid-float
[767.68 - 771.76] or even float
[769.60 - 772.96] yes you can have an unhealthy poop still
[771.76 - 774.80] float
[772.96 - 776.88] in rare occasions and we're going to
[774.80 - 779.12] talk about that too
[776.88 - 780.80] but people have to understand
[779.12 - 782.32] that there are millions and millions and
[780.80 - 784.96] millions of people
[782.32 - 788.08] out there all their sinking but
[784.96 - 789.12] they got problems galore
[788.08 - 791.68] right
[789.12 - 794.08] they got problems galore so that's
[791.68 - 795.76] important to know right there so
[794.08 - 796.96] we're covering some more of this stuff
[795.76 - 799.96] right
[796.96 - 799.96] um
[800.72 - 803.12] so
[801.60 - 804.72] here's the problem
[803.12 - 806.72] you can have a functional medicine
[804.72 - 809.12] doctor you can have a functional
[806.72 - 811.28] medicine doctor right
[809.12 - 813.68] you can have a doctor
[811.28 - 815.44] that's telling your microbiome is
[813.68 - 817.84] completely out of whack
[815.44 - 820.16] you have the worst microbiome you have
[817.84 - 822.08] all these bad different microorganisms
[820.16 - 824.24] in here you get all these problems with
[822.08 - 826.56] your intestinal tract
[824.24 - 828.72] but they're sinking
[826.56 - 830.32] how is anybody on any level any
[828.72 - 831.76] dietitian any nutritionist any
[830.32 - 834.00] functional medicine doctor any health
[831.76 - 836.00] advocate any health influencer anybody
[834.00 - 840.00] that could leave a comment
[836.00 - 842.00] on the medical medium post and tell me
[840.00 - 843.04] that i'm wrong
[842.00 - 846.08] about
[843.04 - 847.92]  sinking and not being good
[846.08 - 849.28] and not being a good thing
[847.92 - 852.08] right
[849.28 - 853.28] how can that be possible
[852.08 - 855.28] okay
[853.28 - 857.36] so that's really that's really important
[855.28 - 858.88] right there it's all it's we're talking
[857.36 - 859.92] about all this different stuff so let's
[858.88 - 861.60] go i'm going to move some of these
[859.92 - 862.54] things out of the way out of the way
[861.60 - 863.76] here
[862.54 - 864.96] [Applause]
[863.76 - 868.12] and we're going to go into it a little
[864.96 - 868.12] bit more
[870.32 - 872.96] so
[871.28 - 874.40] back to poop talk you guys i'm glad you
[872.96 - 876.72] guys are coming on we're live right now
[874.40 - 879.28] this is a really important understanding
[876.72 - 881.36] today i think it is it's very important
[879.28 - 882.96] for a lot of different reasons you got
[881.36 - 884.64] functional medicine doctors all around
[882.96 - 886.32] the world now convincing everybody that
[884.64 - 888.32] their guts are a mess completely they
[886.32 - 890.96] got sibo they got celiac they got all
[888.32 - 892.88] kinds of intestinal tract disorders and
[890.96 - 894.88] they're telling them right their
[892.88 - 896.24] microbiomes off every bit about their
[894.88 - 898.00] gut is off every part of their
[896.24 - 900.00] intestinal tract is off every part of
[898.00 - 901.60] their intestinal tract's messed up right
[900.00 - 904.88] with all kinds of different microbiome
[901.60 - 907.20] problems but they're sinking
[904.88 - 908.48] and that's that's just perfect that's
[907.20 - 910.08] just great
[908.48 - 912.00] see
[910.08 - 913.52] that's that that right so it's important
[912.00 - 916.08] to know how it works so let me tell you
[913.52 - 918.64] a little bathroom story right
[916.08 - 920.16] i had to use a public bathroom
[918.64 - 921.76] a while back
[920.16 - 923.68] it was right before the whole thing of
[921.76 - 926.00] the what we're dealing with now out
[923.68 - 927.44] there and i use the public bathroom okay
[926.00 - 929.60] so i was traveling
[927.44 - 931.44] so it was a bathroom that didn't have
[929.60 - 934.48] more than one toilet so the bathroom the
[931.44 - 936.88] public bathroom only had one toilet
[934.48 - 939.44] it was a small bathroom
[936.88 - 943.20] okay it was in a restaurant
[939.44 - 945.36] and it had one toilet and a sink
[943.20 - 948.32] there were a few people in line i was
[945.36 - 951.12] waiting in line okay the guy in front of
[948.32 - 954.00] me all right was obese
[951.12 - 955.92] and very sick
[954.00 - 957.92] i was standing with him
[955.92 - 960.40] and we were talking about how sick he
[957.92 - 962.64] was he wasn't a well man he had acid
[960.40 - 964.96] reflux he had intestinal tract disorders
[962.64 - 966.56] he was very overweight he had ulcers he
[964.96 - 969.84] had all kinds of different problems he
[966.56 - 972.08] was sick so he was waiting with me as we
[969.84 - 973.44] were standing there and finally when it
[972.08 - 974.80] was time for him to go to bathroom and
[973.44 - 976.56] get in there because the next person
[974.80 - 978.80] left they flushed the toilet and left he
[976.56 - 980.96] went into the bathroom
[978.80 - 982.48] he sat on that toilet for quite a while
[980.96 - 984.40] how do i know because i waited there
[982.48 - 986.88] like this because i had to pee really
[984.40 - 988.80] really bad and i was about to pee my
[986.88 - 990.56] pants standing there so i was like okay
[988.80 - 992.08] this guy has to hurry up i know he's
[990.56 - 994.08] sitting on the toilet right now he's got
[992.08 - 996.40] to hurry up so i'm sitting there kind of
[994.08 - 998.08] moving around like this okay as if i was
[996.40 - 1000.40] like 10 years old or something like that
[998.08 - 1001.76] and i'm like oh my god i gotta pee
[1000.40 - 1003.68] and
[1001.76 - 1006.72] the guy
[1003.68 - 1009.60] i hear him wash his hands in the sink
[1006.72 - 1011.68] but i don't hear the toilet bowl flush
[1009.60 - 1013.68] and then the guy comes out
[1011.68 - 1014.48] and the smell that came out with it was
[1013.68 - 1016.96] oh
[1014.48 - 1018.08] my god the smell was just whoa you
[1016.96 - 1020.48] know what i mean there's somebody in
[1018.08 - 1022.08] back of me we were just like oh my god
[1020.48 - 1024.24] but i had to go in
[1022.08 - 1027.28] i had to go into the bathroom so i went
[1024.24 - 1029.28] into the bathroom to urinate
[1027.28 - 1031.60] and there was a really big turd sitting
[1029.28 - 1032.96] in that toilet
[1031.60 - 1035.92] okay
[1032.96 - 1038.48] and that turd was sunk to the bottom
[1035.92 - 1041.68] and he forgot to flush the toilet
[1038.48 - 1044.00] and that thing sunk to the bottom
[1041.68 - 1048.40] and spirit of compassion said to me that
[1044.00 - 1050.32] guy has more wrong with him
[1048.40 - 1053.12] his guts are a mess
[1050.32 - 1055.36] all kinds of bacteria his microbes
[1053.12 - 1057.36] totally all twisted backwards fungus
[1055.36 - 1059.20] yeast mold in his gut
[1057.36 - 1061.28] he had gallbladder problems he had
[1059.20 - 1062.80] pancreatic problems he had liver
[1061.28 - 1065.68] problems he had gastrointestinal
[1062.80 - 1066.80] problems from his mouth to his butt hole
[1065.68 - 1068.00] and
[1066.80 - 1069.92] his
[1068.00 - 1071.20] looked fine by any standard it was just
[1069.92 - 1074.08] sitting there and it was sunk to the
[1071.20 - 1074.08] bottom of the toilet
[1076.24 - 1080.16] you know
[1077.92 - 1081.76] it's unbelievable when people just pick
[1080.16 - 1083.44] things up from google so if i say
[1081.76 - 1085.60] something it's always against the grain
[1083.44 - 1087.76] i always say something against the grain
[1085.60 - 1090.24] and i'm always proven like right later
[1087.76 - 1091.76] in a couple of years you're gonna hear
[1090.24 - 1093.20] you're gonna see it somewhere else
[1091.76 - 1096.96] you're gonna see somebody come out like
[1093.20 - 1098.40] i'm doctor so doctor is blue
[1096.96 - 1100.48] and i'm just gonna tell you we have
[1098.40 - 1102.08] found out that stools are healthier when
[1100.48 - 1103.84] they're mid-floating you'll see that in
[1102.08 - 1105.20] two years just like i told you that
[1103.84 - 1108.00] multiple sclerosis was caused by
[1105.20 - 1108.96] epstein-barr 35 years of teaching people
[1108.00 - 1111.28] that
[1108.96 - 1113.04] and publishing it right and then science
[1111.28 - 1114.88] says oh wait we think we know the
[1113.04 - 1116.72] finally we think we know the cause it's
[1114.88 - 1117.68] epstein-barr okay nice try he came way
[1116.72 - 1119.20] too late
[1117.68 - 1120.16] to the party
[1119.20 - 1123.76] just like
[1120.16 - 1125.92] the shingles virus is not the chickenpox
[1123.76 - 1128.16] virus but you guys are all told as you
[1125.92 - 1130.08] google every single day and you google
[1128.16 - 1132.00] and everybody says it doctors say the
[1130.08 - 1134.08] chickenpox viruses the shingles are no
[1132.00 - 1135.76] they're not they're two separate viruses
[1134.08 - 1137.44] and now i've been saying that for over
[1135.76 - 1140.16] 35 years and now
[1137.44 - 1141.84] doctors are starting to say that
[1140.16 - 1144.00] just like the blood draw problem right
[1141.84 - 1147.04] remember the blood draw problem
[1144.00 - 1149.36] aw you're wrong you're wrong don't trust
[1147.04 - 1151.92] him don't take advice don't take advice
[1149.36 - 1154.24] from aw whatever you do take advice from
[1151.92 - 1156.16] a licensed health professional
[1154.24 - 1157.84] remember when i told you they're drawing
[1156.16 - 1159.36] the blood and they're killing everybody
[1157.84 - 1160.72] by over drawing the blood they're
[1159.36 - 1162.40] throwing the blood out or doing
[1160.72 - 1164.24] something worse with the blood when you
[1162.40 - 1166.08] can ask for half files or quarter vials
[1164.24 - 1167.60] and guess what now
[1166.08 - 1170.00] it's getting out there
[1167.60 - 1172.72] i'm always proven right
[1170.00 - 1175.36] always so when i talk about poop oh i
[1172.72 - 1178.72] can't trust jw anymore i'm not gonna i'm
[1175.36 - 1182.40] not gonna follow him let me unfollow him
[1178.72 - 1182.40] because it says here on google
[1183.36 - 1188.96] it says right here on google that aw is
[1185.36 - 1190.32] wrong because google has all the answers
[1188.96 - 1191.52] so let's go over some of the questions
[1190.32 - 1193.76] we're talking about poop we're going to
[1191.52 - 1195.60] do celery too if anybody just came on
[1193.76 - 1197.52] here
[1195.60 - 1199.56] i can't say enough about the machine you
[1197.52 - 1201.44] guys know the machine the mm-900 it's at
[1199.56 - 1202.80] omegajuicers.com right
[1201.44 - 1204.56] and
[1202.80 - 1206.16] it's a killer machine
[1204.56 - 1207.60] right it's a medical device it's an
[1206.16 - 1209.92] herbal extractor
[1207.60 - 1211.44] and the price of food like i said six
[1209.92 - 1214.00] months ago and i said a year ago you're
[1211.44 - 1215.84] the price of food's gonna go up and
[1214.00 - 1217.84] right got the inflation got the price of
[1215.84 - 1220.56] food going up and every time i run a
[1217.84 - 1221.84] celery stick through my mm-900 i'm
[1220.56 - 1224.48] saving money
[1221.84 - 1226.40] because it's squeezing more juice out of
[1224.48 - 1228.24] the celery and i'm saving i'm buying
[1226.40 - 1230.48] less celery and i told you guys about
[1228.24 - 1232.48] this with the mm-900 how much i love it
[1230.48 - 1234.16] it doesn't have the metal gears you know
[1232.48 - 1236.08] the metal gears that are grinding
[1234.16 - 1238.24] against each other so you get bits of
[1236.08 - 1239.84] metal and you know what
[1238.24 - 1241.04] when juicer companies with the metal
[1239.84 - 1243.12] gears
[1241.04 - 1245.20] try to do their like cleanup you know
[1243.12 - 1247.92] like fire control like fire damage
[1245.20 - 1250.40] control because it gets out about it and
[1247.92 - 1252.72] they say no our metal gears never touch
[1250.40 - 1254.88] each other that's insanity not only do
[1252.72 - 1256.40] they touch each other they're grinding
[1254.88 - 1258.32] against each other
[1256.40 - 1259.92] as they're as they're grinding the food
[1258.32 - 1261.36] they're also rubbing and grinding
[1259.92 - 1263.12] against each other
[1261.36 - 1265.68] i love how people like to do like you
[1263.12 - 1268.16] know they like to do clean up like dying
[1265.68 - 1270.24] out fires like that the truth is you
[1268.16 - 1272.16] don't have metal gears grinding against
[1270.24 - 1274.88] each other it's an incredible machine
[1272.16 - 1278.08] and it's 72 dollars basically for 72 off
[1274.88 - 1280.80] off omegajuicers.com
[1278.08 - 1283.20] i was told by my doctor right the apple
[1280.80 - 1285.20] absolute uh opposite statement floating
[1283.20 - 1287.60] stool is a sign of not properly
[1285.20 - 1289.52] digesting fats think about the drops of
[1287.60 - 1292.88] oil in the water right
[1289.52 - 1296.16] yes if you put straight oil on water it
[1292.88 - 1299.20] will surface to the top
[1296.16 - 1302.24] but our stools when our digestive system
[1299.20 - 1305.52] isn't working has fat that's gone rancid
[1302.24 - 1306.80] mixed in with protein and it sits like
[1305.52 - 1308.88] lead
[1306.80 - 1310.88] it sits like lead
[1308.88 - 1312.08] that's what happens okay now what you'll
[1310.88 - 1314.16] see is
[1312.08 - 1316.64] cashews have air in them you have to
[1314.16 - 1318.16] know that so there's a pocket inside a
[1316.64 - 1321.84] cashew and i want to show you something
[1318.16 - 1323.60] about a cashew right you see cashews
[1321.84 - 1324.72] have an air pocket
[1323.60 - 1327.04] air
[1324.72 - 1330.48] floats the cashew you actually have to
[1327.04 - 1332.00] open the cashew to let the air out
[1330.48 - 1333.44] and that's that's important to know
[1332.00 - 1336.64] right there
[1333.44 - 1338.16] now what happens here okay
[1336.64 - 1339.52] all right when you have a nut butter and
[1338.16 - 1342.24] it's down here at the bottom you got all
[1339.52 - 1345.12] that protein and you got all that fat
[1342.24 - 1347.36] and that protein and fat is intertwined
[1345.12 - 1350.00] with itself and it doesn't digest and
[1347.36 - 1352.16] break down thoroughly and it sinks the
[1350.00 - 1354.72] stool down to the bottom same thing with
[1352.16 - 1357.44] chicken fat chicken fat
[1354.72 - 1360.08] is mixed in with the protein so it's
[1357.44 - 1362.00] protein and fat both combined protein
[1360.08 - 1364.16] and fat goes rancid it's both combined
[1362.00 - 1366.40] inside your gut and wonder each cl is
[1364.16 - 1369.44] low and their digestive strength is weak
[1366.40 - 1372.00] and your bile reserves are low
[1369.44 - 1374.48] your food ferments
[1372.00 - 1377.12] and it doesn't totally break down and
[1374.48 - 1380.16] everything sinks to the bottom
[1377.12 - 1382.56] that's what happens your stools sink
[1380.16 - 1385.28] very important to know protein and fat
[1382.56 - 1386.56] sinks to the bottom of the toilet bowl
[1385.28 - 1387.84] now there's a question here that's
[1386.56 - 1389.12] pretty funny right here and i just want
[1387.84 - 1391.04] to make sure
[1389.12 - 1392.64] i clear this up okay
[1391.04 - 1395.20] all right and this is this is
[1392.64 - 1397.12] interesting right here okay
[1395.20 - 1399.52] so
[1397.12 - 1402.80] someone says right here
[1399.52 - 1404.48] floating and feeling fabulous
[1402.80 - 1405.76] they feel incredible and they got a
[1404.48 - 1407.84] floating stool
[1405.76 - 1410.32] keep that in mind right that's something
[1407.84 - 1412.16] that's very interesting all right
[1410.32 - 1414.88] here's a question right here what if it
[1412.16 - 1416.72] piles up so what if our poop piles up
[1414.88 - 1419.76] out of the water
[1416.72 - 1421.12] i'm just asking for a friend
[1419.76 - 1422.32] first of all i think it's kind of funny
[1421.12 - 1424.96] because
[1422.32 - 1426.96] sure you're asking for a friend
[1424.96 - 1428.48] no you probably are asking for a friend
[1426.96 - 1430.48] uh-huh
[1428.48 - 1432.96] yeah no sure you're asking for a friend
[1430.48 - 1434.88] i believe that no no you probably are
[1432.96 - 1435.76] asking for a friend right
[1434.88 - 1436.80] sure
[1435.76 - 1438.40] no yeah
[1436.80 - 1440.56] no i don't know i don't know if you're
[1438.40 - 1442.16] asking for a friend you probably are
[1440.56 - 1444.08] what if it piles up out of the water
[1442.16 - 1445.92] what happens is a lot of times people
[1444.08 - 1448.24] have so much poop in them
[1445.92 - 1449.52] that it's it's piling on top of each
[1448.24 - 1451.52] other so
[1449.52 - 1454.56] the poop will go down into the into the
[1451.52 - 1456.32] toilet bowl right it'll be lodged up
[1454.56 - 1459.60] maybe it'll be a hard poop and it'll be
[1456.32 - 1461.68] lodged up right so the poople large will
[1459.60 - 1463.44] lodge up right you'll get some poops to
[1461.68 - 1465.60] lodge up or whatever and start building
[1463.44 - 1468.72] up they're going to bypass the water to
[1465.60 - 1470.40] the point where you're going to have
[1468.72 - 1471.76] you might even have something where
[1470.40 - 1473.60] you've got the tail end of the poop
[1471.76 - 1477.28] which is softer
[1473.60 - 1479.36] so the softer poop is higher up
[1477.28 - 1480.48] okay and your intestinal tract and your
[1479.36 - 1483.04] colon
[1480.48 - 1485.28] so your descending colon
[1483.04 - 1488.08] has softer poop in it so if you do a
[1485.28 - 1489.68] really big poop or a long poop
[1488.08 - 1491.60] you're gonna have softer so you might
[1489.68 - 1493.76] even get a swirl on top so you might get
[1491.60 - 1495.44] the harder poop is at the bottom so
[1493.76 - 1497.60] that's at the bottom of your colon right
[1495.44 - 1500.24] ready to come out so that actually comes
[1497.60 - 1502.00] out right so you can pile that up in
[1500.24 - 1504.24] your toilet to the point where your
[1502.00 - 1506.64] water might only be this high
[1504.24 - 1508.00] or your water might be only this high so
[1506.64 - 1510.48] what's happening is your shit's just
[1508.00 - 1512.56] piling up until you're out of the water
[1510.48 - 1514.96] that's not floating that's just a lot of
[1512.56 - 1518.72]  in a toilet bowl not enough water
[1514.96 - 1520.40] and it's all kind of it's basically
[1518.72 - 1523.04] showing itself above the water because
[1520.40 - 1524.72] it's piled up above the water right
[1523.04 - 1526.32] so that's that answers that question
[1524.72 - 1529.32] which is really important
[1526.32 - 1529.32] okay
[1529.84 - 1533.60] so someone said floating poop is not a
[1531.84 - 1534.88] good poop please don't listen to this
[1533.60 - 1536.32] guy
[1534.88 - 1539.12] all right
[1536.32 - 1540.00] well that's a funny one really okay
[1539.12 - 1541.60] because
[1540.00 - 1543.20] what happens is that
[1541.60 - 1546.48] there are people
[1543.20 - 1548.24] who get their colons cut out every day
[1546.48 - 1550.48] they get six inches of colon cut out and
[1548.24 - 1552.64] then they get 20 inches of colon cut out
[1550.48 - 1554.32] now they get more inches of colon in in
[1552.64 - 1556.48] small intestinal then they get their
[1554.32 - 1558.08] elio sql removed right
[1556.48 - 1559.44] now they've got the colostomy back now
[1558.08 - 1560.88] they're in really big trouble now
[1559.44 - 1562.16] they're getting connected now they're
[1560.88 - 1563.60] they're take some people are getting
[1562.16 - 1566.32] their small intestinal tract and it's
[1563.60 - 1567.92] being pulled on down and they remove
[1566.32 - 1569.52] their colon altogether and their
[1567.92 - 1571.84] intestinal tract is being pulled already
[1569.52 - 1573.44] down right to the rectum right and now
[1571.84 - 1576.88] now it's just their small intestinal
[1573.44 - 1576.88] tract attached to the rectum
[1578.48 - 1582.08] you have to understand something this is
[1580.16 - 1583.92] important
[1582.08 - 1587.60] all the while all that's been happening
[1583.92 - 1587.60] all those years their poop was sinking
[1588.08 - 1594.00] and don't listen to me
[1590.72 - 1596.72] when science of research all they got
[1594.00 - 1598.64] is snip and cut snip and cut
[1596.72 - 1599.44] so when you got intestinal problems
[1598.64 - 1601.28] right
[1599.44 - 1602.80] when you have intestinal problems
[1601.28 - 1606.56] because everything just falls right out
[1602.80 - 1606.56] of here let me take a look here right
[1606.88 - 1612.64] all they can do is give you steroids
[1610.64 - 1613.76] anti-inflammatory
[1612.64 - 1617.28] dangerous pharmaceutical
[1613.76 - 1617.28] anti-inflammatory steroids
[1617.36 - 1620.80] antibiotics
[1618.88 - 1623.44] so they can give you and then they have
[1620.80 - 1625.60] to cut you then they have to remove your
[1623.44 - 1627.44] intestinal tract and colon
[1625.60 - 1629.28] that's all medical science and research
[1627.44 - 1632.00] has for intestinal tract problems now
[1629.28 - 1633.68] functional medicine doctors they they'll
[1632.00 - 1634.80] they'll just say you got some microbiome
[1633.68 - 1636.24] that's off
[1634.80 - 1637.68] right they'll study your poop but
[1636.24 - 1639.60] they'll never measure how much fats in
[1637.68 - 1640.88] your poop they don't look at that
[1639.60 - 1642.40] they're just looking for different
[1640.88 - 1644.16] things like they're looking for mold or
[1642.40 - 1647.04] something they're testing for mold right
[1644.16 - 1649.44] they're testing for yeast or mold
[1647.04 - 1651.60] they're looking for those things
[1649.44 - 1654.64] they're trying to actually look right
[1651.60 - 1657.20] so sharon says former colostomy rn here
[1654.64 - 1660.48] so many people getting colostomies
[1657.20 - 1662.16] saddest job i've ever had and sharon
[1660.48 - 1662.96] all those people
[1662.16 - 1664.80] their
[1662.96 - 1666.56]  was sinking to the bottom of the
[1664.80 - 1668.72] toilet now let's get something straight
[1666.56 - 1671.04] so nobody's having poop fear i don't
[1668.72 - 1672.64] want poop fear happening here it's okay
[1671.04 - 1674.48] if your poop sits at the bottom of the
[1672.64 - 1675.36] toilet i never said it was a terrible
[1674.48 - 1677.12] thing
[1675.36 - 1678.96] you can be eating the healthiest diet
[1677.12 - 1681.84] and it'll sit at the bottom for a while
[1678.96 - 1684.64] until someday it'll take a mid-flight
[1681.84 - 1686.24] because everybody has compacted rancid
[1684.64 - 1688.24] fat and protein still lining their
[1686.24 - 1691.20] intestinal tracts so even when you're
[1688.24 - 1693.68] eating healthy for a long time
[1691.20 - 1696.24] you're going to be now breaking off
[1693.68 - 1699.20] little pieces that start to wrap around
[1696.24 - 1701.04] the stool little pieces of rancid fat
[1699.20 - 1702.72] and protein that are intertwined all on
[1701.04 - 1704.08] the inside of the intestinal tract and
[1702.72 - 1706.00] it's going to wrap around it and
[1704.08 - 1708.08] actually get caught up
[1706.00 - 1710.40] and it's going to sink
[1708.08 - 1712.80] it's not a bad thing if your poop is
[1710.40 - 1714.24] sinking so that's not the big thing here
[1712.80 - 1717.76] i'm not trying to say that i'm saying
[1714.24 - 1720.24] but for the healthiest poops there are
[1717.76 - 1721.84] keeping fats out of the diet
[1720.24 - 1725.20] right
[1721.84 - 1727.60] like eating all raw right
[1725.20 - 1730.40] raw fruits and vegetables raw oranges
[1727.60 - 1732.24] raw berries raw spinach and as you're
[1730.40 - 1734.08] cleaning up your intestinal tract long
[1732.24 - 1736.24] term and bananas and you're cleaning out
[1734.08 - 1738.72] your intestinal tract
[1736.24 - 1740.24] the stools will start to mid-float
[1738.72 - 1742.80] because you've cleaned out that
[1740.24 - 1744.56] intestinal tract to such a degree
[1742.80 - 1747.20] and you're not bombarding your liver
[1744.56 - 1748.88] with so much fat you're not overdoing it
[1747.20 - 1750.40] with the avocado you're not over doing
[1748.88 - 1751.52] it with the nut butters you're not over
[1750.40 - 1752.96] doing it
[1751.52 - 1755.04] with all the nut butters and everything
[1752.96 - 1756.40] else in the tahini right and what's
[1755.04 - 1759.20] happening is you're giving your liver a
[1756.40 - 1760.88] break so when you go raw
[1759.20 - 1762.72] and you could do it cook too it's
[1760.88 - 1764.56] steamed vegetables but if you go raw and
[1762.72 - 1767.44] you keep the fats out
[1764.56 - 1771.20] you get cleaned out over time where now
[1767.44 - 1775.28] your poops are the healthiest poops ever
[1771.20 - 1778.40] because they'll start to mid-float
[1775.28 - 1780.72] the mid-float and they won't smell your
[1778.40 - 1782.80] poops won't smell
[1780.72 - 1784.72] people's poops smell because it's
[1782.80 - 1788.32] ammonia
[1784.72 - 1791.28] and it's rotting putrefying protein and
[1788.32 - 1794.00] rotting rancid putrefied fat and that
[1791.28 - 1797.68] rotting rancid putrified fat and protein
[1794.00 - 1799.60] sits and it makes a streak in the toilet
[1797.68 - 1800.96] you guys know about the streak
[1799.60 - 1802.88] does anybody know about the toilet
[1800.96 - 1805.36] streak
[1802.88 - 1807.36] you know that toilet streak
[1805.36 - 1811.04] that gets in there where the turd goes
[1807.36 - 1812.72] down in there and then it just streaks
[1811.04 - 1817.04] and you're like whoa that's a streak at
[1812.72 - 1817.04] the bottom of my toilet that's fat
[1817.28 - 1821.20] and that's protein
[1819.36 - 1823.76] protein sticky
[1821.20 - 1826.00] and fat becomes sticky with it and
[1823.76 - 1827.68] they're both sticky
[1826.00 - 1829.52] so what you're seeing when you eat a
[1827.68 - 1831.20] whole bunch of nut butter and it hasn't
[1829.52 - 1832.48] been digested
[1831.20 - 1834.48] you've eaten a whole you've eaten a
[1832.48 - 1837.84] whole bunch of nut butter
[1834.48 - 1837.84] and it hasn't been digested
[1837.92 - 1841.92] it creates a streak at the bottom of the
[1840.16 - 1844.16] toilet
[1841.92 - 1845.60] not only does your poop
[1844.16 - 1847.68] sink
[1845.60 - 1848.96] but you left a streak
[1847.68 - 1850.40] as well
[1848.96 - 1852.24] same thing with avocado
[1850.40 - 1854.00] have a avocado
[1852.24 - 1856.16] the fat
[1854.00 - 1859.76] gets trapped inside the rest of the
[1856.16 - 1861.92] debris in the stool
[1859.76 - 1864.80] yes you you do absorb some of the
[1861.92 - 1867.20] avocado yes you absorb some of the nut
[1864.80 - 1869.12] butters and yes you absorb some of the
[1867.20 - 1871.28] tahini and yes you absorb some of the
[1869.12 - 1873.44] peanut butter and yes you do
[1871.28 - 1876.24] but a lot of it you don't
[1873.44 - 1877.76] because everybody has weak digestion
[1876.24 - 1879.44] weak livers
[1877.76 - 1880.80] all kinds of different food allergies
[1879.44 - 1882.48] all kinds of different problems all
[1880.80 - 1884.72] kinds of different issues
[1882.48 - 1887.28] and their hdl is really low and what
[1884.72 - 1889.76] happens is the streaks in the toilet
[1887.28 - 1891.68] from their is from fat that's a fat
[1889.76 - 1893.84] streak
[1891.68 - 1896.40] if you took that streak in the toilet
[1893.84 - 1897.76] and actually cleaned it out and ran a
[1896.40 - 1901.36] test on it
[1897.76 - 1903.76] it would be mostly fat and protein
[1901.36 - 1905.76] and it's undigested it's not digested
[1903.76 - 1907.60] it's not broken down properly it's all
[1905.76 - 1910.16] rancid and that's the streak in your
[1907.60 - 1912.16] toilet bowl
[1910.16 - 1914.08] if you read the comments you'll see that
[1912.16 - 1916.72] people had a field day on that one and
[1914.08 - 1918.96] they were trying to rip me apart
[1916.72 - 1920.80] and i thought it was you know
[1918.96 - 1923.20] i thought it was fine i thought it was
[1920.80 - 1925.20] great i want people to actually be i
[1923.20 - 1926.16] want them to be challenged
[1925.20 - 1927.60] right
[1926.16 - 1929.20] in the sense where they so they could
[1927.60 - 1931.28] learn right
[1929.20 - 1932.80] and but you don't see really people say
[1931.28 - 1934.48] you know what he could be right because
[1932.80 - 1936.88] you're right because all they do is cut
[1934.48 - 1938.56] people's guts right out all they do is
[1936.88 - 1940.64] just remove everybody's colons and
[1938.56 - 1942.80] everything i never thought about it you
[1940.64 - 1945.44] know you know aw you might be right that
[1942.80 - 1947.36] people with colitis crohn's ibs people
[1945.44 - 1949.20] with sibo all their sinks to the
[1947.36 - 1951.04] bottom so why am i saying it's a healthy
[1949.20 - 1952.96]  when literally these people are
[1951.04 - 1954.32] suffering i know people that literally
[1952.96 - 1955.92] all these years they're walking around
[1954.32 - 1957.76] like this they're hurting they're
[1955.92 - 1962.12] bloating and distention and their poop
[1957.76 - 1962.12] sink down to the bottom of the toilet
[1963.60 - 1967.20] but google's right
[1965.68 - 1968.40] so let's talk about you know let's talk
[1967.20 - 1971.36] about how it works a little bit more
[1968.40 - 1973.60] we're going into this you guys
[1971.36 - 1974.80] this is a fun show for me because i
[1973.60 - 1976.32] haven't seen you guys in a while and
[1974.80 - 1977.52] it's really great to see you guys i'm
[1976.32 - 1978.72] glad i'm here
[1977.52 - 1980.16] right
[1978.72 - 1982.00] listen from natasha says this
[1980.16 - 1983.60] information is golden helping so many
[1982.00 - 1985.44] people thank you so much for you in
[1983.60 - 1986.64] spirit of compassion i'm honored you're
[1985.44 - 1988.08] here
[1986.64 - 1989.52] truly
[1988.08 - 1990.64] you know and i was looking at some of
[1989.52 - 1992.16] these other
[1990.64 - 1993.52] other questions which is interesting
[1992.16 - 1995.36] someone said i thought it could also
[1993.52 - 1997.60] mean you have a lot of gas in your bm
[1995.36 - 2001.04] for it to float like all the gas in your
[1997.60 - 2002.72] digestion is causing it to float right
[2001.04 - 2004.56] so here's how it works
[2002.72 - 2006.96] when you truly
[2004.56 - 2008.72] absorb all the fat out of your food and
[2006.96 - 2010.80] you truly absorb
[2008.72 - 2013.84] all of it out of your food and your
[2010.80 - 2016.64] protein you absorb and utilize when you
[2013.84 - 2018.72] absorb and utilize your protein and fat
[2016.64 - 2020.64] your stool
[2018.72 - 2022.32] is light
[2020.64 - 2025.84] it's light
[2022.32 - 2027.68] it's just fiber
[2025.84 - 2029.84] and fiber
[2027.68 - 2032.08] will float
[2029.84 - 2034.16] so when you have such a sharp digestive
[2032.08 - 2036.64] tract it is so strong it's lightening
[2034.16 - 2038.48] fast strong too the fats get totally
[2036.64 - 2040.40] used immediately
[2038.48 - 2042.40] the proteins get utilized and broken
[2040.40 - 2044.56] down immediately
[2042.40 - 2046.40] the rest of that stool is going to be
[2044.56 - 2048.32] fiber and that fiber is going to come
[2046.40 - 2050.64] out in a stool form and it's going to be
[2048.32 - 2053.12] light and it's not going to have smell
[2050.64 - 2055.76] so it'll float because it's light
[2053.12 - 2055.76] it's light
[2056.96 - 2061.68] it's a really important thing to know
[2059.52 - 2063.36] somebody could have really bad gas and
[2061.68 - 2065.52] they could have so much problem they
[2063.36 - 2068.32] could sit like rotting like everything's
[2065.52 - 2070.80] rotting inside of them to such a degree
[2068.32 - 2072.84] that they can have an ammonia gas filled
[2070.80 - 2077.92] stool that does float
[2072.84 - 2080.16] right but most everybody most everybody
[2077.92 - 2083.52] the ship sinks
[2080.16 - 2085.84] the ship sinks in that toilet
[2083.52 - 2088.24] billions of people on this planet every
[2085.84 - 2090.72] morning go to bathroom and they look in
[2088.24 - 2093.04] their toilet and their sinks
[2090.72 - 2095.20] and they're dropping like flies they're
[2093.04 - 2097.52] dying like flies right now we have
[2095.20 - 2099.76] people dying like flies in the united
[2097.52 - 2102.16] states everywhere and their was
[2099.76 - 2104.32] thinking we have people dying everywhere
[2102.16 - 2107.92] around the planet in hospitals dying at
[2104.32 - 2107.92] home and their is sinking
[2110.40 - 2114.24] it's really sad
[2111.92 - 2117.36] right
[2114.24 - 2119.60] so someone said i came to the comments
[2117.36 - 2120.72] just to see if anyone else had the same
[2119.60 - 2122.96] thoughts
[2120.72 - 2124.32] totally backwards from what i was taught
[2122.96 - 2125.92] in college
[2124.32 - 2127.12] so i'm scratching my head on that one
[2125.92 - 2128.56] because
[2127.12 - 2129.52] what you're taught in college is all
[2128.56 - 2131.52] right
[2129.52 - 2133.04] all that's like
[2131.52 - 2135.52] all that's correct
[2133.04 - 2138.08] because that's that's a funny one there
[2135.52 - 2140.32] so everything you learn in college
[2138.08 - 2141.76] is ironclad
[2140.32 - 2143.28] correct
[2141.76 - 2145.52] everything you if you learn in college
[2143.28 - 2147.20] that shingles is the is the chickenpox
[2145.52 - 2148.96] virus like they'll teach in medical
[2147.20 - 2150.48] college
[2148.96 - 2152.16] but yet it's not they're two different
[2150.48 - 2153.36] viruses and nephrologists actually are
[2152.16 - 2154.64] starting to they're starting to talk
[2153.36 - 2156.56] about that now two different viruses
[2154.64 - 2159.04] i've been talking about 35 years how'd
[2156.56 - 2160.72] that one escape it's like they're wrong
[2159.04 - 2162.88] in college all the time they're wrong in
[2160.72 - 2164.72] universities all the time university
[2162.88 - 2168.40] studies are all hypotheses and they
[2164.72 - 2171.12] change by the month and by the year
[2168.40 - 2172.40] yes you were taught wrong in college
[2171.12 - 2174.64] absolutely
[2172.40 - 2177.04] everything
[2174.64 - 2178.80] and here's what's funny
[2177.04 - 2180.64] everything i teach
[2178.80 - 2182.00] has been the opposite of what anybody's
[2180.64 - 2184.40] known in health
[2182.00 - 2187.20] and if you hear something out there that
[2184.40 - 2188.64] is the same it came from medical medium
[2187.20 - 2190.16] information i know you guys don't like
[2188.64 - 2191.60] to hear that i know some people just
[2190.16 - 2193.04] hate hearing that
[2191.60 - 2195.20] but it's true
[2193.04 - 2196.08] but what am i going to do
[2195.20 - 2198.24] not
[2196.08 - 2200.56] say what it is i've been teaching this
[2198.24 - 2202.96] stuff for 35 years
[2200.56 - 2205.20] and have paved the way
[2202.96 - 2207.28] like on the frontier of health all these
[2205.20 - 2208.64] years with so many things it's it's
[2207.28 - 2210.32] actually couldn't count them there's so
[2208.64 - 2212.40] many now and i was going to do a podcast
[2210.32 - 2214.56] someday and show you all the things that
[2212.40 - 2216.08] were published by medical medium or are
[2214.56 - 2217.52] you know released by medical medium and
[2216.08 - 2219.36] how they get figured out later and
[2217.52 - 2221.60] proven right we're gonna do one of those
[2219.36 - 2222.40] that'll be fun
[2221.60 - 2223.76] but
[2222.40 - 2225.12] i can't cover everything today because
[2223.76 - 2226.40] we're gonna do a series on the poop
[2225.12 - 2228.08] because there's so much we're gonna be
[2226.40 - 2229.60] covering and talking about we're going
[2228.08 - 2231.44] to cover all these questions we're going
[2229.60 - 2233.60] to go into details about these questions
[2231.44 - 2236.24] too
[2233.60 - 2236.24] so and
[2236.88 - 2240.56] very important so someone was worried
[2238.48 - 2242.08] and they say great there goes my life
[2240.56 - 2243.60] i'm a sinker so someone was worried
[2242.08 - 2245.04] because their was sinking right so
[2243.60 - 2247.36] they were like great there goes my life
[2245.04 - 2248.64] no not at all it's okay if your poops
[2247.36 - 2249.76] are sinking and it's okay if you're
[2248.64 - 2251.04] eating healthy and your poops are
[2249.76 - 2252.88] sinking
[2251.04 - 2254.00] everybody on a keto diet their poops are
[2252.88 - 2255.20] sinking
[2254.00 - 2257.36] because it's filled with all that fat
[2255.20 - 2260.16] and protein poops are sinking right so
[2257.36 - 2261.92] it's okay if your poops are sinking it's
[2260.16 - 2263.28] not something to fear it's not something
[2261.92 - 2265.84] to be worried about it's not something
[2263.28 - 2268.00] to be scared about or scared over so all
[2265.84 - 2269.68] that's important to know too so let's
[2268.00 - 2270.96] use some celery and that's then that's
[2269.68 - 2273.36] where we're heading now it just means
[2270.96 - 2276.24] you're in a work in progress your
[2273.36 - 2279.20] intestinal tract is still trying to heal
[2276.24 - 2281.28] your liver is still trying to heal it's
[2279.20 - 2282.88] all in the process of healing and we
[2281.28 - 2284.88] need to understand that that's a big
[2282.88 - 2286.32] part of it all if it's in the process of
[2284.88 - 2287.20] healing
[2286.32 - 2289.68] then
[2287.20 - 2291.68] you got to be open to that right look
[2289.68 - 2294.32] someone with colitis
[2291.68 - 2295.84] their poop is thinking
[2294.32 - 2298.88] someone with
[2295.84 - 2301.68] ibs their poop is sinking this is the
[2298.88 - 2304.08] way it is right caroline barrett says
[2301.68 - 2306.80] i've been but have been having problems
[2304.08 - 2309.44] explosive poos cramps bloating feel
[2306.80 - 2311.68] nauseous went to the doctor and he said
[2309.44 - 2313.20] my bowels are blocked and wants to give
[2311.68 - 2316.00] me laxatives
[2313.20 - 2320.16] gabe's stool samples no results results
[2316.00 - 2322.40] back you're a blessing thank you
[2320.16 - 2325.84] what i what i love about celery right
[2322.40 - 2328.08] it's helped so many people
[2325.84 - 2329.28] gastrointestinal problems
[2328.08 - 2331.04] it's it's
[2329.28 - 2333.68] it's
[2331.04 - 2336.08] crazy at this point how many people are
[2333.68 - 2339.04] getting better from it
[2336.08 - 2339.04] it's really amazing
[2339.20 - 2343.84] are you making celery juice motivation
[2341.20 - 2345.92] right here oh that's incredible this
[2343.84 - 2349.12] strengthens the hydrochloric acid so we
[2345.92 - 2349.12] have to understand what that is
[2349.68 - 2352.40] so your stomach
[2351.28 - 2354.16] right
[2352.40 - 2356.16] your stomach
[2354.16 - 2359.04] that's where your hcl is produced right
[2356.16 - 2361.04] there everybody has a stomach you guys
[2359.04 - 2363.60] you have a stomach
[2361.04 - 2365.68] just so you know
[2363.60 - 2368.88] you have a stomach
[2365.68 - 2371.52] that stomach has stomach glands
[2368.88 - 2374.08] so there's tiny stomach lands inside
[2371.52 - 2376.40] here that's what proves produces your
[2374.08 - 2378.88] hcl is those stomach glands that's
[2376.40 - 2379.84] really important to know right
[2378.88 - 2382.16] because
[2379.84 - 2384.08] your stomach lands
[2382.16 - 2385.04] they weaken over the years and they get
[2384.08 - 2387.28] shot
[2385.04 - 2389.52] everybody walks around and their stomach
[2387.28 - 2390.96] glands are just obliterated they're like
[2389.52 - 2393.36] they're damaged
[2390.96 - 2395.28] people have annihilated stomach glands
[2393.36 - 2398.64] where they're not even working anymore
[2395.28 - 2400.40] their hydrochloric acid is non-existent
[2398.64 - 2402.16] they're not digesting their proteins
[2400.40 - 2404.40] they're not digesting their fats and
[2402.16 - 2406.72] their poops are sinking to the bottom of
[2404.40 - 2408.80] the toilet it's fine but you can start
[2406.72 - 2410.32] getting your hcl stronger and you can
[2408.80 - 2412.00] start getting your liver stronger you
[2410.32 - 2414.96] can start getting your stomach land
[2412.00 - 2417.36] stronger and your poops can still sink
[2414.96 - 2419.12] because you're not all the way there yet
[2417.36 - 2420.32] but you're gonna get all the way there
[2419.12 - 2421.44] yet
[2420.32 - 2422.80] right
[2421.44 - 2426.48] celery juice
[2422.80 - 2428.32] kills the bad bacteria
[2426.48 - 2430.32] that's another thing too
[2428.32 - 2431.76] right the reason why people have all
[2430.32 - 2433.60] this bad bacteria thriving in their
[2431.76 - 2437.60] intestinal tract it's feeding off of
[2433.60 - 2440.08] rotting protein and rotting rancid fat
[2437.60 - 2441.92] that's what it's feeding off of
[2440.08 - 2443.12] keep that in mind it's really important
[2441.92 - 2445.04] too right
[2443.12 - 2447.28] the juicer link is in the bio you got
[2445.04 - 2450.00] bio you guys in the bile the juicer link
[2447.28 - 2451.60] is in the bile
[2450.00 - 2455.20] it's it's in the bio right there you
[2451.60 - 2457.60] guys the mm-900 hds
[2455.20 - 2459.92] what i love about the hds you guys know
[2457.60 - 2461.92] right you guys have it is you squeeze
[2459.92 - 2462.80] more celery juice
[2461.92 - 2464.96] out
[2462.80 - 2468.72] you squeeze more celery juice you have a
[2464.96 - 2470.48] smaller food bill right
[2468.72 - 2473.28] you have a smaller food bill and that's
[2470.48 - 2475.12] what's really cool about it juicing is
[2473.28 - 2477.84] not a joke
[2475.12 - 2480.24] it literally is a life-saving tool a
[2477.84 - 2482.96] life-saving tool
[2480.24 - 2484.88] i can't tell you how many times a
[2482.96 - 2487.60] cucumber juice which you can juice in
[2484.88 - 2490.24] here a cucumber juice has brought a
[2487.60 - 2491.20] fever down for children all through the
[2490.24 - 2493.52] years
[2491.20 - 2496.00] i can't tell you how many times a celery
[2493.52 - 2498.96] juice has neutralized acids and has
[2496.00 - 2501.04] stopped somebody from aging and is made
[2498.96 - 2503.12] so their cramping and their gas problems
[2501.04 - 2504.56] went away right i work with omega you

[2643.20 - 2646.32] right
[2644.16 - 2648.40] you got to think about it right
[2646.32 - 2650.64] now remember i mean when we eat food we
[2648.40 - 2652.56] just forget we have the stomach even
[2650.64 - 2654.64] though we know it's there but we don't
[2652.56 - 2656.40] know what's there you can't see it you
[2654.64 - 2658.96] just eat and you're like okay let's just
[2656.40 - 2660.80] move on but inside that stomach the
[2658.96 - 2662.48] minute something falls in that stomach
[2660.80 - 2664.08] so let's get some nuts or something so
[2662.48 - 2666.00] let's do that
[2664.08 - 2668.32] let's get some almonds
[2666.00 - 2669.52] the minute you eat something and those
[2668.32 - 2671.52] almonds
[2669.52 - 2672.72] end up in the stomach right so they go
[2671.52 - 2674.16] down and they end up in the stomach so
[2672.72 - 2676.96] i'm putting some almonds in the stomach
[2674.16 - 2678.64] right here see so the minute that
[2676.96 - 2680.24] happens
[2678.64 - 2681.84] okay
[2680.24 - 2682.96] these little stomach lands inside the
[2681.84 - 2684.96] stomach
[2682.96 - 2687.44] these little stomach glands
[2684.96 - 2690.56] release gastric juice
[2687.44 - 2692.40] hcl hydrochloric acid medical medium
[2690.56 - 2695.36] information
[2692.40 - 2697.20] says that hcl is not one acid it's seven
[2695.36 - 2699.28] different assets so it's a blend science
[2697.20 - 2700.72] research doesn't know that yet but just
[2699.28 - 2702.72] like it always happens science of
[2700.72 - 2704.56] research ends up either poaching medical
[2702.72 - 2706.48] media information or discovering
[2704.56 - 2708.24] something later on this medical medium
[2706.48 - 2710.80] and they're going to say how hcl isn't
[2708.24 - 2712.96] one acid and how it's very complex so
[2710.80 - 2714.72] gastric acid that comes out of the the
[2712.96 - 2715.92] glands here stomach lens is really
[2714.72 - 2717.68] complex
[2715.92 - 2719.52] and when that gastric acid comes out
[2717.68 - 2721.20] it's supposed to break down the protein
[2719.52 - 2723.68] inside that nut
[2721.20 - 2725.28] so when you eat the job there for those
[2723.68 - 2727.92] glands is to break down the protein but
[2725.28 - 2728.88] it doesn't break it down so now these
[2727.92 - 2729.68] nuts
[2728.88 - 2730.72] right
[2729.68 - 2734.56] start to
[2730.72 - 2734.56] leave your intestinal tract
[2734.88 - 2738.48] that nut just sunk down to the bottom of
[2736.80 - 2739.68] the water there
[2738.48 - 2741.44] look at that
[2739.68 - 2743.44] interesting right
[2741.44 - 2744.64] those nuts are high in fat i wonder why
[2743.44 - 2746.72] they're sinking
[2744.64 - 2748.16] just sinking down to the bottom you know
[2746.72 - 2751.04] like
[2748.16 - 2752.32] it's nuts just sink down to the bottom
[2751.04 - 2753.76] unbelievable
[2752.32 - 2755.44] so
[2753.76 - 2757.28] we're back here
[2755.44 - 2759.52] when you drink that celery juice you're
[2757.28 - 2762.24] restoring those stomach glands
[2759.52 - 2764.08] it strengthens that hcl and here's the
[2762.24 - 2766.32] thing people don't know no one knows
[2764.08 - 2766.32] this
[2768.08 - 2773.20] you kill off those viruses and bacteria
[2770.64 - 2776.96] each pylori gets killed off
[2773.20 - 2779.36] right you kill off h pylori
[2776.96 - 2783.04] so what you're doing is your hcl is your
[2779.36 - 2784.88] weapon that is your anti-bug weapon
[2783.04 - 2788.40] that's your critter weapon
[2784.88 - 2790.32] that's your anti-critter weapon
[2788.40 - 2791.84] i hear because i was using critter as
[2790.32 - 2793.76] bugs i hear a bunch of people now out
[2791.84 - 2796.00] there using the word critter right but
[2793.76 - 2798.88] they don't say they got it from aw they
[2796.00 - 2800.48] just start using it whatever
[2798.88 - 2803.04] bottom line is
[2800.48 - 2805.12] here it is the critters and that hcl is
[2803.04 - 2806.88] your critter destroyer right there it
[2805.12 - 2809.20] kills the critters
[2806.88 - 2810.72] your hydrochloric acid has to rebuild
[2809.20 - 2813.52] and celery juice rebuilds your
[2810.72 - 2816.88] hydrochloric acid hydrochloric acid so
[2813.52 - 2818.64] you can destroy the bad guys those evil
[2816.88 - 2823.28] ugly critters that in your gut each
[2818.64 - 2824.16] pylori e coli c diff staff streptococcus
[2823.28 - 2827.04] right
[2824.16 - 2828.96] food poisoning bugs salmonella
[2827.04 - 2830.88] so what happens is that your hdl
[2828.96 - 2832.48] destroys that so when you eat some
[2830.88 - 2834.40] undercooked chicken in some restaurant
[2832.48 - 2837.36] that you don't die that night instead
[2834.40 - 2839.28] you just throw up and vomit and diarrhea
[2837.36 - 2840.64] right you can do all three at once i
[2839.28 - 2842.00] don't know throw up and vomit i guess
[2840.64 - 2843.76] you can do just
[2842.00 - 2845.04] one sometimes you throw up sometimes
[2843.76 - 2846.56] your vomiting whatever you're hugging
[2845.04 - 2848.80] the toilet
[2846.56 - 2851.12] but the whole point is is that when your
[2848.80 - 2852.80] hcl is strong it might be that brinker
[2851.12 - 2854.80] it might stop you from getting that food
[2852.80 - 2856.64] poisoning really bad that day it might
[2854.80 - 2858.48] stop your h pylori from creating an
[2856.64 - 2860.96] ulcer it might stop the e coli from
[2858.48 - 2862.64] creating an ulcer it does even more than
[2860.96 - 2864.40] that it even helps you in so many ways
[2862.64 - 2866.88] when your heat shield breaks down
[2864.40 - 2868.48] everything and that's important
[2866.88 - 2870.80] so what i love about the
[2868.48 - 2873.76] mm-900
[2870.80 - 2875.52] the containers much drier
[2873.76 - 2877.04] than any of the other juicers out there
[2875.52 - 2880.16] that i've ever used
[2877.04 - 2882.24] so that means the juice was squeezed out
[2880.16 - 2883.76] the pulp is drier
[2882.24 - 2885.60] and that's the whole point right so
[2883.76 - 2886.88] you're just getting more out of what
[2885.60 - 2888.40] you're juicing and that's what i love
[2886.88 - 2891.04] about the 900
[2888.40 - 2893.20] carly says juicer is the best one i ever
[2891.04 - 2895.60] used it's worth the money
[2893.20 - 2898.84] you use less celery and get more juice
[2895.60 - 2902.16] aw is a godsend
[2898.84 - 2904.24] incredible i love that
[2902.16 - 2906.08] all right so let's strain it gotta
[2904.24 - 2908.08] strain it
[2906.08 - 2909.20] because it's herbal medicine
[2908.08 - 2910.32] you don't
[2909.20 - 2912.48] eat
[2910.32 - 2915.04] the tea bag right
[2912.48 - 2918.40] you don't eat the tea you don't open up
[2915.04 - 2920.96] the tea is what you don't do right
[2918.40 - 2923.44] so keep that in mind

[3037.04 - 3040.96] did right on ig
[3038.72 - 3043.68] on the the poop posts right don't listen
[3040.96 - 3045.76] to that guy my dietitian says that he's

[3045.76 - 3049.12] they'll tell you differently right and
[3047.68 - 3050.72] then people are like oh i'm gonna
[3049.12 - 3052.64] unfollow medical medium he was always
[3050.72 - 3055.68] right before but now it takes the cakes
[3052.64 - 3058.80] he's wrong
[3055.68 - 3060.64] all right let's strain this celery juice
[3058.80 - 3063.36] i'm not trying to crack myself up here
[3060.64 - 3066.08] for some reason i do a little
[3063.36 - 3068.08] hello anthony i don't have a gallbladder
[3066.08 - 3070.72] how celery juice affect digestion well
[3068.08 - 3072.32] there's no fat in the celery juice it's
[3070.72 - 3074.00] not an overt fat
[3072.32 - 3076.24] it's a herbal medicine
[3074.00 - 3078.56] i i've always used that for people
[3076.24 - 3080.08] without gallbladders it's very helpful
[3078.56 - 3081.84] because every time i drink celery juice
[3080.08 - 3083.44] i get cramps and diarrhea but i feel
[3081.84 - 3084.88] better next day you feel better next day
[3083.44 - 3087.52] what that is
[3084.88 - 3089.76] is you're killing off these
[3087.52 - 3091.36] you're killing off these guys

[3114.56 - 3120.56] when one of these critters die
[3117.12 - 3121.92] it releases a toxic poison
[3120.56 - 3124.72] just so you know

[3267.60 - 3272.48] the celery juice from the store
[3269.60 - 3274.64] effective good question sarah
[3272.48 - 3277.12] if it's juiced fresh
[3274.64 - 3278.96] did someone juice it in the store did
[3277.12 - 3280.72] they actually run it through a juicer at
[3278.96 - 3282.32] one point and put it on the shelf saying
[3280.72 - 3284.56] only good for like one day because it's
[3282.32 - 3287.20] freshly juiced or
[3284.56 - 3289.28] is it in a bottle saying it's fresh and
[3287.20 - 3290.64] they're lying to you
[3289.28 - 3292.56] they're lying
[3290.64 - 3294.80] it's in a bottle and it's called high
[3292.56 - 3297.76] pressure pasteurization high pressure
[3294.80 - 3300.32] pasteurization and what that is hpp is
[3297.76 - 3302.64] that is screwing people over so when you
[3300.32 - 3304.24] buy hpp and you go up there like i want
[3302.64 - 3306.88] to buy that celery juice oh that looks
[3304.24 - 3310.24] like fresh raw celery juice let me buy
[3306.88 - 3311.92] that off the shelf and it's hpp
[3310.24 - 3314.32] you just got ripped off it's not going
[3311.92 - 3316.24] to work as good not even a fraction is
[3314.32 - 3318.48] good with celery juice it can't be
[3316.24 - 3320.24] pasteurized and it'll say raw and it
[3318.48 - 3323.44] will say unpasteurized but that's not
[3320.24 - 3325.36] true hpp's high pressure pasteurization
[3323.44 - 3327.76] that's important to know everybody ask
[3325.36 - 3330.88] about that all the time
[3327.76 - 3333.52] you guys i have like one day
