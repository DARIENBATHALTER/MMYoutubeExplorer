187
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:51,900
that's when there's more going on yes

188
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:54,240
neurotransmitter chemicals

189
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:56,419
are the one critical part of being able

190
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,800
to sleep

191
00:07:56,419 --> 00:08:01,080
neurotransmitter chemicals

192
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,300
what I love about what you're looking in

193
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:05,699
front of you right here okay this

194
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:08,759
stabilizer that we're going to do the

195
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:11,819
sleep and recharging stabilizer

196
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:15,120
is it benefits you in the neuro

197
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:19,580
transmitter activity area that's where

198
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,580
it benefits it's targeting that

199
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:24,720
that's when there's more going on

200
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:28,039
neurotransmitter chemicals are the one

201
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:30,419
critical part of being able to sleep

202
00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:34,459
electricity is running through every

203
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:34,459
neuron as we're sleeping

204
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:38,159
so I think what people really don't

205
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:40,380
realize is when they go to sleep

206
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,459
their neurons are just as active in many

207
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:43,560
ways

208
00:08:41,459 --> 00:08:47,540
so as we're sleeping electricity is

209
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:47,540
still going through all the neurons

210
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:52,740
if neurotransmitters are diminished

211
00:08:50,459 --> 00:08:54,779
here's what's interesting

212
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:59,240
if your neurotransmitters are

213
00:08:54,779 --> 00:09:02,220
diminishing weakened kind of broken down

214
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:04,380
anemic not anemic

215
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:08,760
not anemic like claridin of whatever

216
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:11,640
iron all that stuff no anemic just being

217
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:14,820
very low

218
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:17,899
I'm on page 354 someone just asked

219
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,899
of brain saver

220
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:24,480
if neurotransmitters are diminished

221
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:29,180
electrical impulses have a tough time

222
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,180
traveling throughout the brain

223
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,540
what that means is your electricity

224
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,880
struggles when your neurotransmitters

225
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:38,760
are down

226
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:41,459
low neurotransmitter chemicals or

227
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:44,519
weakened ones can cause the brain to

228
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:47,700
have difficulty finding balance so you

229
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:51,140
can ease into sleep and stay there stay

230
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:51,140
asleep stay there

231
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:58,920
so low neurotransmitter chemicals

232
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,019
or weakened ones

233
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:03,000
can cause the brain to have difficulty

234
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:04,920
finding balance

235
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,620
that means that when you're having

236
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:09,000
diminished

237
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:12,360
neurotransmitter chemicals

238
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,100
your electricity is trying to swim

239
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:16,320
around it

240
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:17,339
it's trying to stay charged while you're

241
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:21,600
sleeping

242
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:25,380
but it's not staying calm and smooth

243
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:27,540
instead it's more erratic

244
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:29,339
it's more Rogue

245
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:31,560
there's a problem

246
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:35,420
so you're not able to relax and sleep

247
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,420
you're not able to stay asleep long

248
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:42,180
memory Stubbs says I have no way to make

249
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:43,680
them where I currently live but I'm

250
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:45,540
watching and learning until I can do

251
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,339
them it's incredible you don't have to

252
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:48,779
make these brain shot therapies you can

253
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:51,240
just listen to the information and

254
00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:53,579
reading out a brain saver some of these

255
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:56,220
uh lives that we've done in these 20

256
00:10:53,579 --> 00:10:57,899
days in this 19 days just phenomenal

257
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,220
information that's been mind-blowing and

258
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:03,200
you don't even have to do the brain

259
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:03,200
shots you can just chill out hang out

260
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,320
someone may also have a sensitive

261
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:09,420
nervous system due to a chronic

262
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:11,220
low-grade viral infection so this is

263
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:13,440
important to know

264
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:15,420
a large majority of people's sleep

265
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,579
issues is because someone has a

266
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:19,560
low-grade viral infection

267
00:11:17,579 --> 00:11:21,060
they don't know it maybe they had an

268
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:23,700
autoimmune diagnosis but don't know

269
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:26,100
that's what it is whatever's going on

270
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:27,839
they're sick with something they're

271
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:30,240
struggling with something

272
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:31,800
so someone may have a sensitive nervous

273
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,600
system now why would you have a

274
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:36,000
sensitive nervous system if you have a

275
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,160
low-grade viral infection

276
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,300
because the Epstein-Barr virus or the

277
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,279
shingles

278
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:43,860
or any of the herpetic virus especially

279
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:45,420
I've seen Barn shingles which often goes

280
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:48,680
undiagnosed

281
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:52,620
releases neurotoxins

282
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:57,060
neurotoxins are unfortunately one of the

283
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:59,100
big problems with people sleeping good

284
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:00,060
I've seen people

285
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,860
okay

286
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:04,380
that have the worst chronic fatigue

287
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:07,260
syndrome the worst me chronic fatigue

288
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:09,600
syndrome or just severe fatigue and you

289
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:11,339
would think they sleep

290
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,860
they're not sleeping they're not

291
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:18,120
sleeping good there are people

292
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:19,920
that are diagnosed with me CFS

293
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,480
they're diagnosed with chronic fatigue

294
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,760
syndrome

295
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:27,180
but they're not sleeping good

296
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:30,120
people can't understand it you're tired

297
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:32,519
you've got fatigue sleep

298
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:34,019
just sleep now there are people that get

299
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:37,140
diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome

300
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:40,320
and they sleep 12 14 hours 16 hours and

301
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:42,959
they can't do anything but sleep but

302
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:45,240
that can be just a temporary part of

303
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:47,940
their chronic fatigue that could be one

304
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:50,220
year and then another year

305
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:52,320
they can't sleep and they still have

306
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:54,899
chronic fatigue syndrome they're tired

307
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,639
they're suffering and they can't sleep

308
00:12:54,899 --> 00:13:00,600
you know anybody that's gone for that

309
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:02,760
that's me Jan Antonio says that's me

310
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,139
that's a big deal and a lot of people go

311
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,760
through that

312
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:09,540
lots of people

313
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:12,360
add add me to Anya's okay

314
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:13,740
so here you are you're tired you don't

315
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,899
feel good

316
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:17,820
you got chronic fatigue

317
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:20,519
or you just feel like your legs feel

318
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:21,779
like sandbags you can't get ahead of

319
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:24,120
yourself

320
00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:25,800
you can only do so much kitchen work you

321
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:27,540
can only do so much you know vacuuming

322
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:29,820
around your house you get wasted easy

323
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:32,100
you're on mattress Island

324
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:35,579
you're fatigued

325
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:38,160
then someone might say to you hey

326
00:13:35,579 --> 00:13:39,480
why don't you just sleep it off

327
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,920
and you're like

328
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,420
I can't

329
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:45,240
I go to bed

330
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:47,399
I can't get eight hours of sleep I can

331
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:50,399
only get four hours or three hours or

332
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:52,740
five hours take a long nap I can't take

333
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:54,600
a long nap I can't fall asleep during

334
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,800
the day but you got chronic fatigue

335
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,480
syndrome you should be able to fall

336
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:59,639
asleep during the day I can fall asleep

337
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:01,980
during the day though I'm suffering I

338
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:04,139
could only take a nap here if I'm lucky

339
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:06,000
I could only get five hours of sleep one

340
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:08,639
night some nights I'll get seven hours

341
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,320
and then the next night two hours this

342
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,579
is what people go through you guys

343
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,579
probably know this right so you probably

344
00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:16,800
know somebody that's gone through this

345
00:14:14,579 --> 00:14:19,860
so there's so many people

346
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:21,360
who get CFS or me CFS meaning they get

347
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:23,339
the diagnosis they're struggling and

348
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:26,399
they're tired all the time they have low

349
00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:28,139
grade viral infections and neurotoxins

350
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,000
are getting to their brain and

351
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:31,680
preventing them from sleeping a peaceful

352
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,360
sleep

353
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,100
their neurotransmitter chemicals are

354
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:38,100
struggling they have neurotoxins in the

355
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:41,399
brain and they can't sleep good but then

356
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:43,139
they get picked on and bullied by people

357
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:45,720
they know friends they know family

358
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:48,839
members they know they get bullied

359
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:50,279
because here you are tired why don't you

360
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:51,540
just get a good night's sleep and get

361
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:53,820
fixed

362
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:55,740
and then one night

363
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:58,019
if they're not on benzodiazepines

364
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:59,880
because they got they got in trouble and

365
00:14:58,019 --> 00:15:01,199
they're addicted to benzos to try to

366
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,519
like get through their anxiety and

367
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:05,820
sleeping and their chronic fatigue

368
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:08,100
syndrome and then one night they sleep a

369
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,760
really long night's sleep a good night's

370
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,980
sleep

371
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:13,380
and then everybody says to him well you

372
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:15,899
slept eight hours that night you should

373
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:18,120
be back to normal you should be fixed

374
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:19,980
and it's like no it gave me a little bit

375
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:22,079
more energy that day it made it so I can

376
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:24,420
function a little bit but I'm not back

377
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:26,100
to normal and I'm not better yet I still

378
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:27,720
have chronic fatigue syndrome yes I

379
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,519
slept one night

380
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,980
but then the next night they only sleep

381
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,839
like two hours or one hour and I know

382
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:35,639
that there's this isn't everybody but so

383
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:39,000
many people right Jessica Gail says

384
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:42,120
always feel like I'm tired of falling

385
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,800
asleep and my body jolts back awake this

386
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:45,779
makes so much sense wish I could get

387
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:47,339
some peaceful sleep I know so many

388
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:49,199
people are going through this

389
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:51,300
so I'm talking about CFS a little bit

390
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:53,399
too where people get blamed they have

391
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:55,019
this chronic chronic fatigue syndrome

392
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:56,820
and they're getting blamed

393
00:15:55,019 --> 00:15:59,399
why don't you just sleep it off and get

394
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:00,720
better you're so tired it's like no I

395
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:03,120
can't sleep and there are people with

396
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,519
CFS their first few years of CFS all

397
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,440
they're doing is sleeping and then they

398
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,880
hit the wall they're not better yet and

399
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,040
they're not sleeping anymore it's like

400
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,899
they slept plenty but they're still sick

401
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:16,380
and still not functioning and can't

402
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:19,560
sleep good anymore there's that too

403
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:21,180
talking about viral issues with any kind

404
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:23,639
of sleep problems since we're what we're

405
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:25,680
dealing with now

406
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:28,500
so someone may also have sensitive

407
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:30,720
nervous systems due to low-grade viral

408
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:32,699
infections like shingles and EBD and the

409
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,320
neurotoxins that are released from these

410
00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:36,300
viruses are swimming around their body

411
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:40,639
attaching themselves to the vagus nerves

412
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:40,639
yes the vagus nerves

413
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:47,399
s the vagus nerves

414
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:49,620
you know and I'll say I'm guilty of

415
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:51,300
saying vagus nerve many times on and off

416
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:53,100
that's because people don't they don't

417
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:54,959
hear you when you say Vegas nerves a lot

418
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:57,420
they'll be like because everybody will

419
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:59,220
be like vagus nerve that's nerves

420
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:00,959
there's two of them I'm saying that

421
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:03,480
because we did a Vegas nerve show right

422
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:05,280
where the nerves

423
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,319
there's two of them coming out of the

424
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:09,480
brain stem and they get all saturated

425
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:12,500
with neurotoxins and that really stops

426
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,500
people from sleeping too

427
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:21,860
all right let's keep on going

428
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:24,120
which page Gabrielle says Gabriella 354.

429
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:27,780
neurotoxins breaking out of the liver

430
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:31,080
and traveling through the bloodstream

431
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:34,380
can reach the brain

432
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:36,900
where they saturate pollute and diminish

433
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:39,900
neurotransmitter chemicals that's one of

434
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:41,780
the key points right there

435
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:45,480
a lot of people have diminished

436
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:48,419
neurotransmitter chemicals why

437
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:50,100
why are they diminished

438
00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:51,660
some people might diminish them because

439
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,740
they're smoking too much weed some

440
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:54,600
people might diminish them because

441
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:56,220
they're doing Ayahuasca some people

442
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:58,380
might dim diminish them because they're

443
00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:00,299
doing too much psilocybin some people

444
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:02,400
might diminish them because you're not

445
00:18:00,299 --> 00:18:03,600
getting any nutrients at all for their

446
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,880
brain and they're under tremendous

447
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,559
stress it's a huge trigger some people

448
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:09,419
might have them diminished for other

449
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:11,100
reasons too some people don't have

450
00:18:09,419 --> 00:18:13,820
enough glucose in their brain and that's

451
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,820
diminishing it

452
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:20,600
but neurotoxins

453
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:20,600
breaking out of the liver

454
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:26,460
and traveling through the bloodstream

455
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:28,500
can reach the brain where they saturate

456
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:30,299
and pollute and diminished

457
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:32,280
neurotransmitter chemicals this is

458
00:18:30,299 --> 00:18:34,140
important neurotoxins from low-grade

459
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:37,760
viral infections which everybody who's

460
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:37,760
diagnosed with autoimmune has

461
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:41,039
they don't know it but that's what they

462
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:44,340
have

463
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:46,679
everybody diagnosed with autoimmune at

464
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:48,299
the doctor's office is struggling with a

465
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:49,799
low-grade viral infection whether the

466
00:18:48,299 --> 00:18:51,419
doctor knows it because they don't know

467
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:53,039
medical meme information or they do know

468
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:55,679
medical meme information because that's

469
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:57,860
mm info I put that out there all these

470
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,860
years

471
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,660
even if they don't if that they don't

472
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:05,160
test for it or not test for it they got

473
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:06,600
a glow grade viral infection and here's

474
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,320
what happens with autoimmune you might

475
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:11,520
not

476
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:14,220
see a viral issue in a test but five

477
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:17,179
years later it shows up because it was

478
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:17,179
the problem the whole time

479
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:23,640
hence Kathy says not having the energy

480
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,799
to make the shots

481
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:28,559
I have been alternating alternating

482
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:30,780
between the lemon balm and shock therapy

483
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:33,480
and the California poppy shock therapy

484
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:35,640
helps my sleep and my restless legs

485
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:38,039
that's incredible that is incredible I

486
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:40,940
got the lemon balm here

487
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:40,940
foreign

488
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:44,179
but yeah

489
00:19:45,299 --> 00:19:50,580
incredible education educating myself

490
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:54,059
and doctors think these pains are

491
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:55,679
autoimmune and genetic unbelievable

492
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:58,500
so what happens is people have these

493
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:00,140
low-grade viral infections

494
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:02,820
there is

495
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:05,460
protocols in here

496
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:06,360
medical meme shock Therapies

497
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:08,220
because that's what we were talking

498
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:10,340
about a second ago right medical meme

499
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:12,299
shock therapies and protocols first

500
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:15,600
sleeping issues and all kinds of other

501
00:20:12,299 --> 00:20:18,360
problems too it's an Incredible Book

502
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:20,340
Incredible Book you can take the book to

503
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:23,240
your doctor and ask your doctor what's

504
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:23,240
right for you

505
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:31,980
neurotoxins breaking out of the liver

506
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:34,380
like I said traveling through the

507
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:36,480
bloodstream

508
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:38,940
saturate the brain and diminish

509
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,860
neurotransmitter activity

510
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:42,360
because someone has a low-grade viral

511
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:44,820
infection and if they have a higher

512
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:47,580
grade viral infection high grade it can

513
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:48,900
even be worse and more difficult there

514
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:52,200
are people out there

515
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:55,200
that cannot sleep for four straight days

516
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:57,660
they get hospitalized or they have to

517
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:00,919
induce a coma

518
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:00,919
because they can't sleep

519
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:06,960
and I've always told people I've ever

520
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:09,059
known and run into anything like this

521
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,460
but you can't see it

522
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:14,220
like you're not sleeping

523
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:15,600
you have to see it as you're healing and

524
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:17,700
resting your central nervous system

525
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,820
whether you sleep or not

526
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:23,100
if you lay there

527
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:25,799
know that you're still healing

528
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:28,919
with your eyes shut and you're laying

529
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:31,760
there there is something called resting

530
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:31,760
your nerves

531
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:37,620
and if I'm not mistaken because these

532
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:39,659
books are two very large Bibles here and

533
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:42,120
even I

534
00:21:39,659 --> 00:21:43,380
forget which book has what in it I have

535
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:45,299
to grab these books and read them over

536
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:48,559
and over again

537
00:21:45,299 --> 00:21:48,559
I'm not perfect

538
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:53,220
but I'm not a genius

539
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:56,299
but the information is profound and

540
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:56,299
unfreaking believable

541
00:21:57,299 --> 00:22:01,320
IG

542
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:04,020
Hackberry Tomo says experience this

543
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:06,120
tired and can't sleep I was punching my

544
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:08,700
wall and yelling begging to fall asleep

545
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:10,200
very annoying no more after medical

546
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:12,299
leave information okay then I have

547
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:14,220
something to say to you

548
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:16,400
I want to find resting the nerves in

549
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:16,400
here

550
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:21,080
I'm hoping it's here

551
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,100
I think it might be in my other book

552
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:33,900
yes it is of course

553
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:37,140
I thought that was protocols for a

554
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:38,760
second silly me let me just do this

555
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:41,059
that's what's incredible about these

556
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,059
books

557
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,799
can you keep that straight

558
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:49,159
it's like 12 pounds

559
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:55,740
all right

560
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:57,539
it's in the back of Protocols of course

561
00:22:55,740 --> 00:23:00,780
do you guys know the medical meeting

562
00:22:57,539 --> 00:23:05,280

563
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:08,640

564
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:11,840
to know that you guys be like no aw I

565
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,840
know we're resting the nerves is

566
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:19,260
resting nurse I want to read this a

567
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:21,120
little bit this is really important

568
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:22,140
right here so I'm in protocols right

569
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:25,640
here

570
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:28,919
and resting the nerves

571
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:30,960
this is a very powerful centering

572
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:32,520
technique that reboots the nervous

573
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:36,059
system

574
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:37,980
our brains are all susceptible to

575
00:23:36,059 --> 00:23:39,780
becoming weakened and neurologically

576
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:41,760
sick

577
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:43,260
if you can't sleep and you're punching

578
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,700
the wall which guess what I've heard

579
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:46,620
that before

580
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:49,559
I've heard people Punch walls I've heard

581
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:51,780
people punch beds I've heard people

582
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:52,980
kick things I've heard people hurt

583
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:54,720
themselves in the middle of the night

584
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:57,020
because they can't sleep I've heard it

585
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,020
all right

586
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:02,940
and it breaks my heart because that's

587
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:06,179
like a hell it I've I've heard people

588
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:09,419
say it's an unbelievable hell

589
00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:13,760
to not be able to sleep in unbelief

590
00:24:09,419 --> 00:24:13,760
insane unbelievable hell

591
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,600
there's something to know if you can't

592
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:19,919
sleep if you ever run into a problem you

593
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,419
can't sleep or you're not sleeping the

594
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:24,600
hours you want to sleep something very

595
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:27,559
critical to know you can still help to

596
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,559
heal your nervous system

597
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:32,220
resting the nerves this is a very

598
00:24:30,539 --> 00:24:34,080
powerful centering technique that

599
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:35,940
reboots the nervous system

600
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,500
our brains are all susceptible to

601
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:40,679
becoming weakened and neurologically

602
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:42,000
sick this approach is accessible to all

603
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:45,200
of us

604
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,200
Spirit of compassion

605
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:50,000
never never stops to amaze me

606
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:54,240
this approach is accessible to all of us

607
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:57,120
when we need to give the brain and

608
00:24:54,240 --> 00:25:00,120
nervous system a quick restorative so we

609
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:02,280
can be stronger for the day or night

610
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:05,039
you can try it anywhere in an office

611
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:07,260
chair lying or sitting on the floor bed

612
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:09,720
or couch at home

613
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:12,539
sitting at the kitchen table parked in

614
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:14,580
your car the options are endless as long

615
00:25:12,539 --> 00:25:16,500
as it's a spot where you'll be safe

616
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:19,320
closing your eyes

617
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:21,240
that's part of the power here it's so

618
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:22,799
easy to do

619
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,360
to get started

620
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:25,740
you're going to stop whatever else

621
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:28,320
you're doing and if it's in the middle

622
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:31,640
of the night that's fine you already are

623
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,640
find a comfortable position

624
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:36,900
if you have a choice opt for lying down

625
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:39,179
if not sitting up works

626
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:40,679
now close your eyes and keep them closed

627
00:25:39,179 --> 00:25:41,940
for eight to twenty minutes now if

628
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:43,260
you're laying there at night in the

629
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:44,820
middle of the night you can go way more

630
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:47,039
than eight to 20 minutes

631
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:48,600
but just know you can help to rejuvenate

632
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:50,700
and restore your nervous system even

633
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:55,140
when you got insomnia and can't sleep

634
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:56,700
I'm on page 540 of protocols Incredible

635
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:59,000
Book I mean you've got to get these

636
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:59,000
books

637
00:26:00,179 --> 00:26:05,539
ideally you'll keep them closed for 12

638
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:05,539
to 15 minutes

639
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:11,900
that's the most effective window this is

640
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,900
brain saver protocols

641
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,880
you have less time eight minutes is okay

642
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:19,380
so I'm talking about if you're in the

643
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,700
middle of the day you can do this so you

644
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:22,679
can just do eight minutes in the middle

645
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:24,000
of the day this is so incredible so if

646
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:27,059
you're not sleeping good at night and

647
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,159
you're wrecked you're wrecked from it

648
00:26:27,059 --> 00:26:30,779
if you're not sleeping at night you're

649
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:32,640
just feel like you're destroyed from it

650
00:26:30,779 --> 00:26:35,779
you can do this in the middle of the day

651
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,779
regardless of where you are

652
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:39,840
eight minutes is okay if you have even

653
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,460
less time

654
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:44,220
don't not do it

655
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:46,140
don't not do it

656
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:48,600
even three to four minutes is helpful

657
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:50,760
any amount of time spent with this

658
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:53,600
technique when you need a nerve recharge

659
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,600
will serve you

660
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,919
when you close your eyes and sit or lie

661
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:01,580
back you need to remind yourself why

for me vicious cycle I wish I would have

686
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:59,820
found medical medium back then straight

687
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:02,539

so happy now problem is Christina

689
00:28:02,539 --> 00:28:07,440
there's large amounts of people out

690
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:11,039
there trying to prevent people from

691
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:14,520
finding medical medium now at this point

692
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:16,980
there's lots of naysayers and haters

693
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:20,340
just telling people don't

694
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:22,500

I support people who eat animal protein

698
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:30,480
because we're not one size fits all

699
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:32,400
medical medium you can come here and

but it's unbelievable really and it's

702
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:38,580
sad because I know so many people that

00:28:36,659 --> 00:28:40,380
aren't finding medical medium easy right

704
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:43,020

00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:16,080
about not being able to sleep either

720
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:18,600
at least that's how it is for most of us

721

730
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,860
punishing people but when

731
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:51,240
what I have noticed in a lot of healing

732
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:54,000
communities out there

733
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:55,740
it's about punishing people they punish

734
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,320
the crap out of people

735
00:29:55,740 --> 00:30:00,480
you're the blame

736
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:02,100
it's your body attacking itself your

737
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,899
thoughts are making you sick you're

738
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:06,919
creating it I've seen it all out there

739
00:30:03,899 --> 00:30:06,919
it's just it's insane

740
00:30:07,799 --> 00:30:11,640
someone was actually left a comment and

741
00:30:09,899 --> 00:30:13,020
they were screaming in the comment you

742
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:15,419
know how when people but you know how

743
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:16,980
when people put large capital letters

744
00:30:15,419 --> 00:30:19,559
like non-stop like it's all capital

745
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:23,880
letters it was something like

746
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:27,720
how dare you tell me medical medium that

747
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:30,179
genes aren't why I'm sick it's my genes

748
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:32,159
and it went across like jeans and then

749
00:30:30,179 --> 00:30:34,860
it went like something like

750
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:36,899
my jeans are bad

751
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:38,580
that's what science tells me and I

752
00:30:36,899 --> 00:30:41,640
believe science

753
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:44,100
it's not any kind of viral infection or

754
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:46,799
this and this my genes are bad and I was

755
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:47,480
like dear Lord okay okay okay okay okay

756
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:49,620
okay

757
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:51,659
if that's what you want to believe then

758
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:54,120
your genes are bad you were born with

759
00:30:51,659 --> 00:30:56,159
bad genes you're just a bad Gene

760
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:58,320
Heather Jenkins says the brain saver

761
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:59,700
book is so amazing each chapter just

762
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:01,740
blows my mind and it's really

763
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:04,799
interesting to read at first I was

764
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:07,860
intimidated because it was so big

765
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:10,200
but it moves along quickly I am

766
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:13,520
intimidated by

767
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:13,520
these books right here

768
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:16,940
because

769
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:22,740
it's it's just unbelievable how big they

770
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:24,360
are and what's in there Lynn Albers I

771
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:26,340
don't care what any of those people say

772
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:29,159
I will always follow medical medium only

773
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:31,679
thing that works thank you Lynn and you

774
00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:33,600
even survive all the smear campaigns and

775
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:34,320
hit pieces on me over and over again for

776
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,940
years

777
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,940
you even survive all that

778
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:45,140
incredible

779
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:45,140
because I'm such a bad person

780
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:53,039
and everybody's perfect out there but me

781
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:55,140
everybody's perfect out there

782
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:57,360
for me

783
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:59,460

00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:01,320
all right so when you when you close

00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:02,820
your eyes and sit there lie back you

786
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:05,220
need to remind yourself of doing this to

787
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:07,799
rest your nerves and check this out

788
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:10,880
this technique is not here to punish you

789
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:10,880
for any thoughts

790
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:16,740
you're not doing it wrong if you have a

791
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:19,620
reactive racing mind

792
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:22,260
this is not of meditation but yet it is

793
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:24,539
but it's not it's not about controlling

794
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:26,820
your thoughts you can rest your nerves

795
00:32:24,539 --> 00:32:29,220

any thoughts and stresses pounding

801
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:44,940
through your head you can be laying

802
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,580
there in the middle of night suffering

803
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:49,320
hating yourself for not sleeping you can

804
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:52,080
be in the middle of the night suffering

805
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:54,840
and struggling totally wrecked by it

806
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:57,200
totally upset by it really going through

807
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,200
a lot

808
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:07,919

the benefits of this exercise

814
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:25,799
override any thoughts and stresses

815
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:27,419
pounding through your head

816
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:29,600
there's something pounding through your

817
00:33:27,419 --> 00:33:29,600
head

818
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:34,340

that's part of its power as long as you

823
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:57,779
know the purpose behind it

824
00:33:54,059 --> 00:33:59,700
the second you shut your eyes and tell

825
00:33:57,779 --> 00:34:01,980
yourself that you're restoring your

826
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:04,919
nervous system any thoughts and worries

827
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:06,720

828
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:08,399

840
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:39,419
your nerves resting your nerves

841
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:41,159

tell yourself that you're restoring your

right when you first close your eyes

852
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:11,700

single second

858
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:24,839

00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:27,240
exercise is that when you do it for the

860
00:35:24,839 --> 00:35:29,160

suffering and they've tried everything

872
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:56,940
and they do this in the middle of the

873
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:59,160
night and they start healing their

874
00:35:56,940 --> 00:36:02,760

00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:47,220
can't shut down my mind because I have a

934
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:49,740
voice talking to me

935
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:51,900
so it's not easy

936
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:53,700
it's nothing easy about that it's a

937
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:55,560
whole other story someday I will go into

938
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:58,500
detail about that

939
00:38:55,560 --> 00:39:00,900
it's more than what people could even

940
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:02,400
imagine actually

941
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:04,320
I write a little bit about it in the

942
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,780
brain saver books and medical medium

943
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:09,720
Origins but it's way worse than anything

944
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:12,240
I've ever said when it comes down to

945
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:13,980
hearing the voice I hear and you may

946
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:16,020
think well I don't really believe he

947
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:18,119
hears a voice then fine I'm a genius I'm

948
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:20,579
a freaking genius then with all these

949
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:22,740
books and info all original unique info

950
00:39:20,579 --> 00:39:26,099
I must be genius

951
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:28,260
but I you know I've endorsed melatonin

952
00:39:26,099 --> 00:39:29,640
primergy you know I've endorsed Bemidji

953
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:32,820
in all their different products okay

954
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:34,920
because companies put hidden ingredients

955
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:38,280
in there companies put hidden

956
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:41,339
ingredients you're allowed to legally

957
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:44,940
place a certain percentage

958
00:39:41,339 --> 00:39:46,920
of unidentified hidden ingredients in

959
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:49,320
the products and not

960
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:52,320
put it on the bottle that's the rules

961
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:53,760
the regulations Emoji says no we're not

962
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:56,940
going to do that we're not going to play

963
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:58,859
that game no caking agents no bonding

964
00:39:56,940 --> 00:40:01,200
agents know nothing hidden

965
00:39:58,859 --> 00:40:02,880
and that's why they're not only just the

966
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:05,220
highest quality they do things no one's

967
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:07,320
ever done and there's a reason it costs

968
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:09,420
more money for the companies to do those

969
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:10,680
things and it's smarter and the other

970
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:12,060
companies I don't see them do either

971
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:13,740
they're not smarter and they're not

972
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:15,300
doing these things

973
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:16,619
which is incredible and it's the highest

974
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:19,260
quality stuff you can check out the

975
00:40:16,619 --> 00:40:21,839
medical meme directory

976
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:23,280
or just memory.com

977
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:25,140
and you know any company I've ever

978
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:27,000
supported if they start changing their

979
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:29,820
ways and they're going downhill it's

980
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:32,599
like see you later whatever

981
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:32,599
all right

982
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:38,339
thanks for bringing up the Melatonin

983
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:40,500
I tell like my friends about it all the

984
00:40:38,339 --> 00:40:43,079
time and everything triple Leo says

985
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:45,900
laugh out loud my ex used to punch me

986
00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:49,020
when he couldn't sleep

987
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:50,040
then would pretend he did it in his

988
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:53,940
sleep

989
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:56,400
I eventually caught on laugh out loud

990
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:58,320
that's just like that's I feel really

991
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:00,119
bad for you to go through that I really

992
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:02,820
do

993
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:06,180
so many people are

994
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:08,820
I mean I can tell you that

995
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:11,400
when people don't sleep the craziest

996
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:13,440
stuff can happen it just can't and the

997
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:15,660
most difficult stuff can happen

998
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:18,660
for years I've seen people like I said

999
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:20,040
there's this thing where if you

1000
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:22,140
I don't know if you've ever met somebody

1001
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:24,000
that's gone through this but there are

1002
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:27,000
people and I've seen people throughout

1003
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:29,400
the years that can go two days three

1004
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,200
days without sleeping and it's in agony

1005
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:32,640
it's a hell it's a torture where

1006
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,680
literally their whole body's rattling

1007
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:36,300
and shaking they're literally pacing

1008
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:38,099
it's three days later they haven't

1009
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:39,839
fallen asleep and when they finally fall

1010
00:41:38,099 --> 00:41:42,060
asleep it's like literally a seizure

1011
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:44,480
sleep it's like you go into like a

1012
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:44,480
seizure

1013
00:41:44,579 --> 00:41:47,579
foreign

1014
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:55,020
this technique gets even more helpful

1015
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:56,940
every time you do it because your brain

1016
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:58,260
learns the routine of this restorative

1017
00:41:56,940 --> 00:42:00,480
exercise we're talking about resting the

1018
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:02,820
nerves if you just got on here and then

1019
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:06,060
I I went on some different directions

1020
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:07,619
it's all kind of related when your eyes

1021
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:09,900
are closed

1022
00:42:07,619 --> 00:42:11,940
your neurotransmitters will start

1023
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:13,260
strengthening

1024
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:15,240
did you hear that

1025
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:16,800
if you lay there at night and you close

1026
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,820
your eyes and you're just resting your

1027
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,680
nerves and you're telling yourself

1028
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:20,760
you're resting your nerves

1029
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:22,320
you're strengthening your

1030
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:24,000
neurotransmitters

1031
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:25,980
your electrical impulses will start

1032
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,020
calming down

1033
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:30,540
your neurons will start resting from

1034
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:33,300
less activity even if you're still

1035
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:35,520
thinking about your day or you're angry

1036
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:37,740
about not sleeping

1037
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:40,619
the emotional centers of your brain will

1038
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:42,599
cease to have full control over you when

1039
00:42:40,619 --> 00:42:44,520
your central nervous system knows you're

1040
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:47,640
taking care of it and giving it what it

1041
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:49,740
needs right then errant Rogue thoughts

1042
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:51,420
can't interfere with your nerve

1043
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:53,579
strengthening minute by minute this

1044
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:55,320
technique is like a quick charge for the

1045
00:42:53,579 --> 00:42:58,200
central nervous system the nutrients

1046
00:42:55,320 --> 00:43:01,020
from any Healing Foods you've eaten so

1047
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:02,880
far that day can be used that much more

1048
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:04,500
effectively while you rest your nerves

1049
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:07,819
it's this technique also helps

1050
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:07,819
strengthen the immune system

1051
00:43:10,859 --> 00:43:15,119
now it's the time you've set aside for

1052
00:43:12,839 --> 00:43:17,099
yourself is coming to an end of this

1053
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:18,780
exercise try to get in touch with the

1054
00:43:17,099 --> 00:43:19,940
fact that your brain and nerves have now

1055
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:22,740
strengthened

1056
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:24,359
resonate with this realization that

1057
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:26,220
they're stronger than when you started

1058
00:43:24,359 --> 00:43:28,640
and that each time you do this it's more

1059
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:28,640
effective

1060
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:32,099

00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:14,099
what happens if you have bad dreams if

1118
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:15,660
you have nightmares you're healing

1119
00:46:14,099 --> 00:46:17,880
through that

1120
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:21,619
keep that in mind your healing through

1121
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:21,619
those nightmares and those bad dreams

1122
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:29,880
all right let's go next one

1123
00:46:25,079 --> 00:46:33,079
eighth of a cup of tightly packed Dill

1124
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:33,079
get some dill in here

1125
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:36,980
it's about good

1126
00:46:37,319 --> 00:46:44,160
next quarter cup of chopped cucumber

1127
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,319
can't throw that one right

1128
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:49,339
not without hitting the juicer so I

1129
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:49,339
choked on that one

1130
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:56,300
but I didn't drop it on the floor

1131
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:56,300
quarter cup chopped cucumber

1132
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:00,500
let's send the cube through there

1133
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:08,180
foreign

1134
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:08,180
nice get you moving there you go

1135
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:16,880
next after that half cup roughly chopped

1136
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:16,880
lettuce

1137
00:47:20,579 --> 00:47:23,359
and more than that

1138
00:47:24,839 --> 00:47:29,480
squeeze into tightly packed

1139
00:47:40,619 --> 00:47:42,800
foreign

1140
00:48:00,599 --> 00:48:05,339
so you want to get that in there and

1141
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:09,300
then a half of teaspoon of pure maple

1142
00:48:05,339 --> 00:48:10,920
syrup and here's what's incredible

1143
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:15,020
and I asked Spirit of compassion about

1144
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:15,020
this recipe the spring shot

1145
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:21,960
why would the maple syrup go in there

1146
00:48:19,619 --> 00:48:24,420
is the maple syrup going in there to

1147
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:26,339
make it taste good

1148
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:28,560
if that's the case shouldn't maple syrup

1149
00:48:26,339 --> 00:48:31,619
be in every single brain shot therapy

1150
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:34,079
you would think so right if the maple

1151
00:48:31,619 --> 00:48:35,400
syrup is there to make it taste good the

1152
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:36,960
shot

1153
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:38,579
and maybe the maple syrup should be in

1154
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:40,560
everything it should be in every single

1155
00:48:38,579 --> 00:48:42,180
brain shot there but no

1156
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:43,319
it's very compassion told me the maple

1157
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:45,599
syrup

1158
00:48:43,319 --> 00:48:47,099
was to get glucose to the brain and then

1159
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:48,300
I said well okay glucose to the brain

1160
00:48:47,099 --> 00:48:49,859
that would be good for everything

1161
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:51,420
shouldn't we just be a maple syrup all

1162
00:48:49,859 --> 00:48:53,460
day these are the questions I asked

1163
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:54,540
because it's just you know that I'm the

1164
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:56,520
messenger I got to ask these questions

1165
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:58,740
goes down

1166
00:48:56,520 --> 00:49:02,160
it's the trace minerals in the maple

1167
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:03,540
syrup and glucose combined with that

1168
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:06,300
form of glucose which is entirely

1169
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:07,800
different inside the mango combined with

1170
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:09,540
the trace minerals and the lettuce

1171
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:12,720
combined with

1172
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:15,839
phytochemical compounds in the

1173
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:18,060
um Dill combined with what's in the

1174
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:19,859
Cucumber it's that combination in the

1175
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:22,740
amounts that does something to the brain

1176
00:49:19,859 --> 00:49:24,720
because these are literally an entirely

1177
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:27,300
different situation this isn't about a

1178
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:30,140
tasty juice shot that's why some of them

1179
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:30,140
just taste so bad

1180
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:35,180
it's really really incredible when you

1181
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:35,180

this one right he says you still have to

1220
00:51:18,599 --> 00:51:22,460
have a little bit of the maple syrup

1221
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:22,460
mixed in

he says if you don't have maple syrup

1223
00:51:25,859 --> 00:51:30,660
the mango might just be enough

1224
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:35,119
but he said you have to have the maple

1225
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:35,119
syrup and then it really kicks in harder

1350
00:56:48,839 --> 00:56:53,160
more blissed out dreams of tropical

1351
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:55,079
island vacations which could be a

1352
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:58,260
nightmare for some people

1353
00:56:55,079 --> 00:57:00,059
some people tropical nightmares

1354
00:56:58,260 --> 00:57:02,099
vacations

1355
00:57:00,059 --> 00:57:03,900
I mean you hear about it out there like

1356
00:57:02,099 --> 00:57:06,359
yeah some people go on a tropical

1357
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:08,640
vacation and something terrible happens

1358
00:57:06,359 --> 00:57:10,859
like they could be a nightmare

1359
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:13,619
once you understand what's behind those

1360
00:57:10,859 --> 00:57:16,339
bad dreams you won't want them to go

1361
00:57:13,619 --> 00:57:16,339
anywhere

1362
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:21,780
I just said basically you don't want to

1363
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:23,819
lose your bad dreams once you understand

1364
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:26,520
what's behind those bad dreams you won't

1365
00:57:23,819 --> 00:57:30,140
want them to go anywhere bad dreams are

1366
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:30,140
the Soul's way of healing

1367
00:57:31,079 --> 00:57:36,960
bad dreams are the Soul's way of healing

1368
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:38,880
when we're awake we're not supposed to

1369
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:40,520
be Breaking Down the Walls of our

1370
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:44,160
emotional hurt

1371
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:46,140
when we are wounded a physical component

1372
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:48,240
in the brain puts up a barrier to

1373
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:51,240
protect us from constantly processing

1374
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:53,099
and reprocessing the pain so that we can

1375
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:55,619
be productive and move forward during

1376
00:57:53,099 --> 00:57:58,380
our waking hours so we're not reliving

1377
00:57:55,619 --> 00:57:59,760
all the pain see how it works all the

1378
00:57:58,380 --> 00:58:01,559
hardships you had in your life the

1379
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:03,000
struggles you had in your life we're not

1380
00:58:01,559 --> 00:58:04,319
supposed to be reliving it every single

1381
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,760
minute we won't even be able to be

1382
00:58:04,319 --> 00:58:08,000
productive right we won't be able to

1383
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:08,000
push through

1384
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:14,520
so there's walls that are up that are

1385
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:18,319
naturally supposed to be there

1386
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:18,319
they're not walls of denial

1387
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:23,460
they're they're walls of divine

1388
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:25,740
protection

1389
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:28,500
these walls these emotional walls inside

1390
00:58:25,740 --> 00:58:31,260
of our brain are emotional walls of

1391
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:34,260
divine protection

1392
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:36,480
so we're not suffering every minute all

1393
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:38,280
day long so all of our hardships the

1394
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:39,960
Betrayal the broken trust all the crap

1395
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:43,740
that's happened in our lives all the

1396
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:45,839
losses all the struggles if we live in

1397
00:58:43,740 --> 00:58:47,640
that every single second we won't be

1398
00:58:45,839 --> 00:58:50,400
able to do anything

1399
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:52,559
so a lot of that gets tucked away it

1400
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:55,680
gets tucked away the old stuff gets

1401
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:58,020
tucked away there is a natural wall it's

1402
00:58:55,680 --> 00:59:00,599
not a wall of denial it's a wall of

1403
00:58:58,020 --> 00:59:03,660
divine protection

1404
00:59:00,599 --> 00:59:07,140
while some conscious processing is

1405
00:59:03,660 --> 00:59:09,680
healthy and necessary it's not meant to

1406
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:09,680
haunt us

1407
00:59:10,140 --> 00:59:15,900
we're not

1408
00:59:11,579 --> 00:59:18,900
supposed to be haunted constantly about

1409
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:20,160
things we've gone through or we're not

1410
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:22,920
going to be able to function so good

1411
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:25,460
there's a Divine protective wall that's

1412
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:29,180
built inside of our brain it's both

1413
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:29,180
Supernatural and natural

1414
00:59:30,839 --> 00:59:35,280
the time to process that pain is in our

1415
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:37,440
sleep by the way

1416
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:43,400
when we're sleeping

1417
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:43,400
that's the time to process our pain

1418
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:51,359
when we're not conscious

1419
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:53,940
that's when we process that pain that's

1420
00:59:51,359 --> 00:59:56,160
what's incredible this is blowing my

1421
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:58,859

for a reason

1443
01:00:49,559 --> 01:00:53,339

that you have gone through you guys is

1445
01:00:53,339 --> 01:00:57,359
in our sleep

1446
01:00:55,319 --> 01:01:00,359
when we're not conscious

1447
01:00:57,359 --> 01:01:02,579
the emotional walls come down so the

1448
01:01:00,359 --> 01:01:05,220
soul can do its cleanup and repair work

1449
01:01:02,579 --> 01:01:07,500
when you're sleeping at night the

1450
01:01:05,220 --> 01:01:08,880
emotional Wall comes down it's not

1451
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:10,319
supposed to come down during the day

1452
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:12,119
when you're trying to function and drive

1453
01:01:10,319 --> 01:01:13,619
a car and live your life and work or do

1454
01:01:12,119 --> 01:01:16,920
whatever you're doing

1455
01:01:13,619 --> 01:01:18,720
being creative painting whatever it's

1456
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:21,540
supposed to come down the Walls when

1457
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:23,760
you're sleeping so your soul can do its

1458
01:01:21,540 --> 01:01:26,940
clean up and repair work

1459
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:29,700
this means that all sorts of difficult

1460
01:01:26,940 --> 01:01:32,460
emotions get stirred up and they work

1461
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:34,440
themselves out through our dreams it's

1462
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:35,940
meant to be worked out through our

1463
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:39,859
dreams

1464
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:43,940
we're supposed to heal emotional injury

1465
01:01:39,859 --> 01:01:43,940
through our dreams

1466
01:01:45,540 --> 01:01:50,819

01:01:48,299 --> 01:01:54,260

1468
01:01:50,819 --> 01:01:54,260

1471
01:02:01,140 --> 01:02:06,920
it's like my being of my existence or

1472
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:06,920

sure fear sure betrayal guilt and

1476
01:02:18,599 --> 01:02:22,319
humiliation would build up and build up

1477
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:24,119
and build up within us until they

1478
01:02:22,319 --> 01:02:26,880
overpower the strength of the walls

1479
01:02:24,119 --> 01:02:29,819
holding them in place that means

1480
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:31,680
if you don't heal frustration anger fear

1481
01:02:29,819 --> 01:02:33,299
betrayal guilt and humiliation if you

1482
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:37,200
don't heal

1483
01:02:33,299 --> 01:02:39,480
the wounds that are behind things and if

1484
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:42,839
you don't heal those in your sleep then

1485
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:44,640
they can come out during the day

1486
01:02:42,839 --> 01:02:45,900
that wall comes down during the day you

1487
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:47,460
don't want that you want the wall to

1488
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:50,280
come down when you're sleeping that is

1489
01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:52,319
part of the Divine protection aspect of

1490
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:55,579
our design

1491
01:02:52,319 --> 01:02:55,579
Spirit of compassion says

1492
01:02:56,579 --> 01:02:59,819
if we didn't do this frustration anger

1493
01:02:58,619 --> 01:03:01,500
of fear of betrayal guilt and

1494
01:02:59,819 --> 01:03:02,819
humiliation would build up and build up

1495
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:04,619
and build up within us until they

1496
01:03:02,819 --> 01:03:06,359
overpower the strength of the walls

1497
01:03:04,619 --> 01:03:07,740
holding them in place and took over our

1498
01:03:06,359 --> 01:03:10,200
waking lives

1499
01:03:07,740 --> 01:03:11,880
it doesn't take over my Waking Life life

1500
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:14,579
even though I get betrayed or whatever

1501
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:16,380
it is or whatever's happening out there

1502
01:03:14,579 --> 01:03:19,680
there's so much hate on medical medium

1503
01:03:16,380 --> 01:03:21,859
and all that it doesn't take over my

1504
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:21,859
life

1505
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:28,500
because it heals through my dreams

1506
01:03:25,319 --> 01:03:31,160
that's where the Wall comes down when

1507
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:31,160
you're sleeping

1508
01:03:33,180 --> 01:03:37,619
so

1509
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:41,540
during my waking days

1510
01:03:37,619 --> 01:03:41,540
people say I'm a pretty happy guy

1511
01:03:42,119 --> 01:03:46,440
you know and so what's funny is because

1512
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:48,119
I'm being productive um getting the

1513
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:49,319
information out on working hard whatever

1514
01:03:48,119 --> 01:03:52,920
it is

1515
01:03:49,319 --> 01:03:55,319
right I don't let those things take over

1516
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:57,480
and dominate my life

1517
01:03:55,319 --> 01:03:59,220
I heal those through my dreams at night

1518
01:03:57,480 --> 01:04:01,700
like Spirit of compassion is saying we

1519
01:03:59,220 --> 01:04:01,700
all do

1520
01:04:02,220 --> 01:04:07,680
instead our dreams release them this

1521
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:10,260
nightly house cleaning aided by the

1522
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:11,579
angel of sleep and if you don't believe

1523
01:04:10,260 --> 01:04:13,140
in the Angels if you don't believe in

1524
01:04:11,579 --> 01:04:15,480
angels

1525
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:19,160
then maybe it's something else a gnome

1526
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:19,160
maybe it's something else of sleep

1527
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:23,280
maybe you just think God helps us sleep

1528
01:04:21,839 --> 01:04:25,380
whatever it is that you believe you

1529
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:28,020
don't believe in angels that's okay

1530
01:04:25,380 --> 01:04:29,819
but our dreams released this nightly

1531
01:04:28,020 --> 01:04:32,280
house cleaning aided by the angel of

1532
01:04:29,819 --> 01:04:34,500
sleep and the angel of Dreams many times

1533
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:36,900
when people take melatonin it allows

1534
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:40,260
them to dream when they weren't able to

1535
01:04:36,900 --> 01:04:44,280
dream before and that helps people to

1536
01:04:40,260 --> 01:04:46,200
heal their emotions in their sleep

1537
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:49,020
by the way

1538
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:51,660
nightmares are not a bad sign

1539
01:04:49,020 --> 01:04:53,700
that's a sign that the brain that your

1540
01:04:51,660 --> 01:04:56,180
emotional your soul your state is

1541
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:56,180
healing

1542
01:04:56,460 --> 01:05:00,660
this nightly house cleaning aided by the

1543
01:04:58,619 --> 01:05:02,819
angel of sleep the angel of dreams and

1544
01:05:00,660 --> 01:05:04,319
the unknown Angels helps the unknown

1545
01:05:02,819 --> 01:05:06,900
angels

1546
01:05:04,319 --> 01:05:09,359
the unknown angels

1547
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:12,299
helps us face what's going on in life

1548
01:05:09,359 --> 01:05:16,079
without becoming scared by it

1549
01:05:12,299 --> 01:05:18,780
sometimes dreams have staying power

1550
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:20,940
a dream can stick to you all day or even

1551
01:05:18,780 --> 01:05:23,280
longer even years

1552
01:05:20,940 --> 01:05:25,260
can I just ask you guys something

1553
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:28,260
have you been in a situation where a

1554
01:05:25,260 --> 01:05:30,720
dream has stayed with you for years a

1555
01:05:28,260 --> 01:05:33,240
dream that you had a long time ago a

1556
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:36,799
dream that you might have had and it has

1557
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:36,799
stayed with you for years

1558
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:42,599
these dreams can be confusing we often

1559
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:43,619
dream of family and other loved ones for

1560
01:05:42,599 --> 01:05:46,200
example

1561
01:05:43,619 --> 01:05:49,079
with the swirl of emotions

1562
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:51,359
even if everything is going fine in a

1563
01:05:49,079 --> 01:05:53,640
waking relationship a dream can bring a

1564
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:55,559
feeling of hurt or

1565
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:57,299
loneliness

1566
01:05:55,559 --> 01:05:58,500
and it's okay if you don't remember your

1567
01:05:57,299 --> 01:06:00,780
dreams either

1568
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:03,200
that's okay too there's nothing wrong

1569
01:06:00,780 --> 01:06:03,200
with that

1570
01:06:03,299 --> 01:06:07,680
even if everything is going fine in a

1571
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:10,619
waking relationship a dream can bring a

1572
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:13,980
feeling of hurt or uneasiness

1573
01:06:10,619 --> 01:06:16,740
or if it's a relationship where there's

1574
01:06:13,980 --> 01:06:18,960
been some challenge or distance dreams

1575
01:06:16,740 --> 01:06:22,319
can bring up the Old Wounds making us

1576
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:24,180
contemplate what went wrong years ago to

1577
01:06:22,319 --> 01:06:27,119
cause the pain

1578
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:29,700
we may wake from a dream feeling like we

1579
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:32,640
did something wrong you were processing

1580
01:06:29,700 --> 01:06:35,660
at night so you don't have to do it in

1581
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:35,660
your Waking Life

1582
01:06:40,799 --> 01:06:44,339
even if a relationship where there's

1583
01:06:42,660 --> 01:06:46,859
been some challenge or some distance

1584
01:06:44,339 --> 01:06:49,319
dreams can bring up Old Wounds making us

1585
01:06:46,859 --> 01:06:51,839
contemplate what went wrong years ago to

1586
01:06:49,319 --> 01:06:55,140
cause the pain we may wake from a dream

1587
01:06:51,839 --> 01:06:57,480
feeling like we did something wrong

1588
01:06:55,140 --> 01:07:00,119
or like we weren't heard or perceived

1589
01:06:57,480 --> 01:07:05,059
right as we painfully try to decode what

1590
01:07:00,119 --> 01:07:05,059
it means we can be left feeling empty

1591
01:07:06,180 --> 01:07:11,520
all of this is healthy I've heard from

1592
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:13,740
people who told me that a bad dream made

1593
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:15,960
them pick up the phone and call a family

1594
01:07:13,740 --> 01:07:18,180
friend

1595
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:20,160
or a friend or a family member they

1596
01:07:18,180 --> 01:07:21,780
hadn't talked to in years that's what

1597
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:24,119
bad dreams can do

1598
01:07:21,780 --> 01:07:26,339
Juliet says I have bad dreams almost

1599
01:07:24,119 --> 01:07:28,799
every night which makes sense since I

1600
01:07:26,339 --> 01:07:31,640
have been through trauma and PTSD it

1601
01:07:28,799 --> 01:07:31,640
makes a lot of sense

1602
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:36,900
people have bad dreams about an old

1603
01:07:35,099 --> 01:07:38,760
family friend or something and they

1604
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:40,559
contact them and it's amazing about how

1605
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:42,359
this works

1606
01:07:40,559 --> 01:07:45,539
see

1607
01:07:42,359 --> 01:07:47,280
and dash says I did not dream for over

1608
01:07:45,539 --> 01:07:50,180
10 years thank you for changing that

1609
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:50,180
incredible

1610
01:07:50,819 --> 01:07:56,099
any empty feeling is because toxic

1611
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:57,900
wounds and emotions left us or started

1612
01:07:56,099 --> 01:08:01,020
to leave us that's the empty feeling we

1613
01:07:57,900 --> 01:08:04,400
can get to in our sleep reducing our

1614
01:08:01,020 --> 01:08:04,400
storage of Bank of hurt

1615
01:08:04,559 --> 01:08:10,140
even though we think it's the opposite

1616
01:08:07,079 --> 01:08:11,819
bad dreams rejuvenate us even when we

1617
01:08:10,140 --> 01:08:14,339
think it's the opposite a bad dream

1618
01:08:11,819 --> 01:08:15,539
rejuvenates us how insane is that so

1619
01:08:14,339 --> 01:08:17,339
cool

1620
01:08:15,539 --> 01:08:19,859
they remind us that there are people

1621
01:08:17,339 --> 01:08:22,739
places and things in our lives that may

1622
01:08:19,859 --> 01:08:25,679
need some attention so we can move on

1623
01:08:22,739 --> 01:08:28,400
bad dreams don't close doors they open

1624
01:08:25,679 --> 01:08:28,400
doors

1625
01:08:29,100 --> 01:08:32,900
I think I'm gonna quote that you guys

1626
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:37,219
think I'm gonna remember that one okay

1627
01:08:37,620 --> 01:08:43,739
I'll make a medical medium quota that

1628
01:08:40,020 --> 01:08:45,120
bad dreams don't open doors they try if

1629
01:08:43,739 --> 01:08:47,600
I'm going to do the quote can I get the

1630
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:47,600
quote right

1631
01:08:48,060 --> 01:08:53,540
bad dreams don't close doors they open

1632
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,540
doors

1633
01:08:53,759 --> 01:09:00,179
I love doing live shows

1634
01:08:57,060 --> 01:09:02,160
to create new beginnings

1635
01:09:00,179 --> 01:09:03,960
I should add that to the quote too they

1636
01:09:02,160 --> 01:09:06,660
create new beginnings

1637
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:09,600
even if you're not aware of what that

1638
01:09:06,660 --> 01:09:11,880
new beginning is it's happening

1639
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:13,560
far down the road you can quote all of

1640
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:16,140
medical medium books right like if you

1641
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:18,900
you can turn quotes into like every line

1642
01:09:16,140 --> 01:09:23,359
is always but it's mind-blowing

1643
01:09:18,900 --> 01:09:23,359
Spirit of compassion did a fantastic job

1644
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:27,239
even if you're not aware of what that

1645
01:09:25,380 --> 01:09:28,920
new beginning is it's happening far down

1646
01:09:27,239 --> 01:09:32,040
the roads you may have the perspective

1647
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:34,920
to see what opportunity a bad dream

1648
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:36,960
led to you and your way LED

1649
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:39,600
to your life

1650
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:42,080
we wish each other sweet dreams sweet

1651
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:42,080
dreams

1652
01:09:43,020 --> 01:09:47,520
sweet dreams

1653
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:51,500
or if you're a mobster or something

1654
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:51,500
sweet dreams right whatever

1655
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:57,920
it's pretty funny

1656
01:09:53,460 --> 01:09:57,920
we wish each other sweet dreams

1657
01:09:58,440 --> 01:10:03,540
back then all those years ago I put this

1658
01:10:00,719 --> 01:10:06,860
in the books but people say I'm just a

1659
01:10:03,540 --> 01:10:06,860
fruit and vegetable guy

1660
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:12,360
and the rest of it I've

1661
01:10:09,780 --> 01:10:15,260
they have fruit and vegetables man and

1662
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:15,260
then I got it all wrong

1663
01:10:19,140 --> 01:10:25,580
but they got it wrong

1664
01:10:22,140 --> 01:10:25,580
man do they got it wrong

1665
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:29,940
we wish each other sweet dreams when

1666
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:31,980
really we should wish each other healing

1667
01:10:29,940 --> 01:10:33,600
dreams we're not supposed to say sweet

1668
01:10:31,980 --> 01:10:35,400
dreams we're supposed to say healing

1669
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:39,440
dreams

1670
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:39,440
I wish you healing dreams

1671
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:46,980
to advance the soul

1672
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:50,699
men the heart and simply

1673
01:10:46,980 --> 01:10:53,400
empty yourself or harmful emotions you

1674
01:10:50,699 --> 01:10:56,340
don't want every dream to be perfect and

1675
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:58,640
tranquil and Flowery you don't want your

1676
01:10:56,340 --> 01:10:58,640
dream

1677
01:11:00,060 --> 01:11:05,820
to be a Wonderland

1678
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:07,980
and only that you want your dreams to

1679
01:11:05,820 --> 01:11:09,840
have some hardship in them because you

1680
01:11:07,980 --> 01:11:11,880
want the good stuff to be happening when

1681
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:13,980
you're awake you want the bad stuff to

1682
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:16,739
happen when you're asleep if our dream

1683
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:19,860
life if our dream lives were total

1684
01:11:16,739 --> 01:11:23,600
fantasy sleeping would be the only thing

1685
01:11:19,860 --> 01:11:23,600
we'd ever want to do

1686
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:27,840
now there are Sinister people in the

1687
01:11:25,980 --> 01:11:29,820
world that have existed throughout

1688
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:32,219
history I love when Spirit of compassion

1689
01:11:29,820 --> 01:11:33,960
does stuff like this

1690
01:11:32,219 --> 01:11:35,159
or talked about stuff like this and say

1691
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:37,020
things like this these books are

1692
01:11:35,159 --> 01:11:39,120
incredible

1693
01:11:37,020 --> 01:11:40,800
now there and this is years ago right we

1694
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:42,960
know how the world's getting even more

1695
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:45,179
Sinister I mean

1696
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:45,900
now there are Sinister people in the

1697
01:11:45,179 --> 01:11:49,020
world

1698
01:11:45,900 --> 01:11:51,719
they have existed throughout history

1699
01:11:49,020 --> 01:11:54,840
these cold-hearted people can go through

1700
01:11:51,719 --> 01:11:56,880
life without one nightmare

1701
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:58,260
if you look it doesn't mean you're a

1702
01:11:56,880 --> 01:12:00,780
Sinister person just because you never

1703
01:11:58,260 --> 01:12:03,060
had a bad dream once in your entire life

1704
01:12:00,780 --> 01:12:06,179
but there are Sinister people where they

1705
01:12:03,060 --> 01:12:09,060
don't have those bad dreams that's an

1706
01:12:06,179 --> 01:12:10,980
indication of how cut off they are from

1707
01:12:09,060 --> 01:12:13,020
processing negative experiences like

1708
01:12:10,980 --> 01:12:15,360
pain and suffering since they don't deal

1709
01:12:13,020 --> 01:12:17,880
with their pain while they sleep they

1710
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:19,620
hold on to it in their waking lives and

1711
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:21,960
they want to inflict that opinion on

1712
01:12:19,620 --> 01:12:25,500
others which book page is this lag

1713
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:27,360
on YouTube it's page 260 of thyroid

1714
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:30,480
healing

1715
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:32,280
yes on the flip side you can have the

1716
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:34,380
most compassionate generous loving

1717
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:38,120
person who can't go a night without

1718
01:12:34,380 --> 01:12:38,120
dreaming something unpleasant

1719
01:12:39,719 --> 01:12:44,580
believe it or not this is the healthier

1720
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:47,520
process

1721
01:12:44,580 --> 01:12:49,500
because this person is so tuned in she's

1722
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:51,659
a witness to other struggles she

1723
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:53,760
experiences the range of human suffering

1724
01:12:51,659 --> 01:12:55,440
and so when she checks out for the night

1725
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:58,980
her brain needs

1726
01:12:55,440 --> 01:13:01,140
to protect her from becoming haunted by

1727
01:12:58,980 --> 01:13:03,179
it in her Waking Life

1728
01:13:01,140 --> 01:13:06,060
this is just I'm trying to re-digest

1729
01:13:03,179 --> 01:13:09,900
this information she may dream of

1730
01:13:06,060 --> 01:13:11,580
schoolyard bullies and natural disasters

1731
01:13:09,900 --> 01:13:14,040
and War zones

1732
01:13:11,580 --> 01:13:16,560
and it's all for her benefit so that

1733
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:20,100
rather than waking up bitter that she

1734
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:23,100
has to leave some Fantastical fantasy

1735
01:13:20,100 --> 01:13:24,960
dream and face a harsh World instead she

1736
01:13:23,100 --> 01:13:26,760
can wake up or leave to leave those

1737
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:30,980
tough dreams behind and ready to

1738
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:30,980
continue Her Sacred work of compassion

1739
01:13:31,260 --> 01:13:36,300
here's one of the last paragraphs right

1740
01:13:33,420 --> 01:13:39,000
here this is deep this is deep

1741
01:13:36,300 --> 01:13:41,960
I was if there's ever a term to use that

1742
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,960
would be the term right now

1743
01:13:43,199 --> 01:13:49,880
I love this paragraph right here

1744
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:49,880
let me be clear

1745
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:54,540
that having good dreams does not make

1746
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:56,580
you a bad person

1747
01:13:54,540 --> 01:13:59,340
let me be clear that's what Spirit of

1748
01:13:56,580 --> 01:14:01,560
compassion said that's what I wrote

1749
01:13:59,340 --> 01:14:04,440
of course not

1750
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:06,840
it's all about balance in addition to

1751
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:09,659
those memorable bad dreams we're meant

1752
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:12,000
to have beautiful dreams as well the

1753
01:14:09,659 --> 01:14:14,520
Angels sometimes grant us dreams of

1754
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:18,060
transcendence and Hope

1755
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:21,420
sometimes our dreams are premonitions or

1756
01:14:18,060 --> 01:14:24,239
messages or creative inspiration

1757
01:14:21,420 --> 01:14:26,280
some nights some nights we have mild bad

1758
01:14:24,239 --> 01:14:28,500
dreams in which we process emotions

1759
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:31,860
though we're spared from remembering

1760
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:35,640
what happened Come Morning other times

1761
01:14:31,860 --> 01:14:38,580
we get to visit with we get a visit with

1762
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:40,140
a deceased loved one in our dreams has

1763
01:14:38,580 --> 01:14:42,239
that ever happened to you I just want to

1764
01:14:40,140 --> 01:14:43,920
ask you guys that

1765
01:14:42,239 --> 01:14:46,020
have you ever had

1766
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:48,719
you were sleeping and you had a dream

1767
01:14:46,020 --> 01:14:50,900
and a deceased loved one came into the

1768
01:14:48,719 --> 01:14:50,900
dream

1769
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:53,780
foreign

1770
01:14:54,659 --> 01:14:58,159
just remember to welcome

1771
01:14:58,860 --> 01:15:05,280
the dreams that challenge you

1772
01:15:01,860 --> 01:15:08,580
they are doing you a great service as

1773
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:11,100
your body heals during slumber

1774
01:15:08,580 --> 01:15:13,380
they are not a punishment or judgment

1775
01:15:11,100 --> 01:15:14,219
they are helping you become your best

1776
01:15:13,380 --> 01:15:17,460
self

1777
01:15:14,219 --> 01:15:19,980
what the afterward is your Soul's gold I

1778
01:15:17,460 --> 01:15:21,780
don't know if you guys read that

1779
01:15:19,980 --> 01:15:23,400
rising out of the ashes says I love that

1780
01:15:21,780 --> 01:15:25,380
you say

1781
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:27,840
she in the books

1782
01:15:25,380 --> 01:15:29,340
otherwise it's always he and other books

1783
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:31,560
can I say something about that Rising on

1784
01:15:29,340 --> 01:15:33,739
the ashes I got a lot of flack from that

1785
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:33,739
one

1786
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:38,699
from what

1787
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:40,380
they say and I can't I can't be quoted

1788
01:15:38,699 --> 01:15:43,560
on this because I don't know if someone

1789
01:15:40,380 --> 01:15:45,840
did it before but before medical medium

1790
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:48,260
books it said that no one puts she in

1791
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:48,260
front of he

1792
01:15:48,440 --> 01:15:52,500
and the medical medium books were the

1793
01:15:50,699 --> 01:15:54,540
first books published where he was at

1794
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:57,140
where he was after she where it was she

1795
01:15:54,540 --> 01:15:57,140
in front of he

1796
01:15:57,420 --> 01:16:03,239
it's her in front of him

1797
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:05,520
and all the other books I was told

1798
01:16:03,239 --> 01:16:08,640
and even my publisher said they said we

1799
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:11,760
think no one's done that before we think

1800
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:14,940
it was always him and her

1801
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:18,300
right he and she

1802
01:16:14,940 --> 01:16:20,699
or always he and the medical meme books

1803
01:16:18,300 --> 01:16:22,500
were her and him

1804
01:16:20,699 --> 01:16:24,000
the first time they think in publishing

1805
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:25,440
history that's what we believe I mean

1806
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:27,179
maybe there was one book somewhere that

1807
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:30,120
was 100 years ago I don't know but I'm

1808
01:16:27,179 --> 01:16:32,520
saying that's what we we've learned

1809
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:36,540
Lori's page and that was that was really

1810
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:39,540
cool um Lori says yes I a dream I had

1811
01:16:36,540 --> 01:16:42,360
for 10 years about my son who came to me

1812
01:16:39,540 --> 01:16:46,340
before I became pregnant with him that's

1813
01:16:42,360 --> 01:16:46,340
incredible absolutely incredible

1814
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:49,739
