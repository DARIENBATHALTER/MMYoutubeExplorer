[0.08 - 3.76] weak adrenals and sodium levels that's a
[2.20 - 5.12] question that comes up all the time just
[3.76 - 6.32] because you have weak adrenals doesn't
[5.12 - 8.36] mean that you're not going to have any
[6.32 - 11.04] sodium levels but if you're hitting your
[8.36 - 12.64] body with the quick hit the wrong sodium
[11.04 - 15.08] is not going to help your adrenals you
[12.64 - 17.32] can also cook your adrenals and salt you
[15.08 - 19.32] can pickle them your adrenals need salts
[17.32 - 21.04] your adrenals need salt you know
[19.32 - 24.04] trainers out there now health coaches
[21.04 - 26.48] out there dude you can pickle your
[24.04 - 28.88] adrenals you can dry them up like little
[26.48 - 30.44] prunes if you overs salt and then it
[28.88 - 32.16] gets worse need more salt for my
[30.44 - 33.72] adrenals but your adrenals are being
[32.16 - 36.48] pickled and they're shriveling up and
[33.72 - 38.44] dying more salt for my adrenals ma'am
[36.48 - 40.48] your adrenals aren't doing good so you
[38.44 - 42.44] need more salt and you're addicted to
[40.48 - 44.16] the Salt so you're misreading all the
[42.44 - 46.32] signs and when you're sick and
