medical medium and I'm super excited to

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:13,650
share from the man himself who created

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:16,619
this incredible celery juice phenomena

5
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:19,500
really and that I have personally been

6
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:22,949
on for the last six months drinking my

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,830
you know 16 ounces of celery juice on an

8
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:27,180
empty stomach every morning and I have

9
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:29,609
personally noticed the benefit and so I

10
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:31,830
have the wonderful man here himself to

11
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:33,809
tell you about the incredible health

12
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:35,640
benefits all drinking celery juice in

13
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:37,590
the morning one of the best things it

14
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,570
does is a restores your hydrochloric

15
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:41,790
acid and everybody's digestion is weak

16
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:43,260
and they're bloated or they're

17
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:45,450
constipated or they have problems out

18
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:48,780
there with their digestion acid reflux

19
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:50,280
and it repairs and heals the digestive

20
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,440
system by repairing the hydrochloric

21
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,120
acid recovering it and fixing the liver

22
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,590
getting the liver stronger that's the

23
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,750
whole point getting liver stronger and

24
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:59,730
getting people better so it's amazing

25
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:02,460
and how much celery juice do you drink

26
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:04,500
every morning I feel like 24 ounces 16

27
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:07,020
ounces on an empty stomach is like green

28
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,640
that's fantastic I do like 24 ounces

29
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:10,740
some people can do more but 16 ounces

30
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,610
minimum I'm gonna up my dose to 24

31
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,159

32
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:17,850
