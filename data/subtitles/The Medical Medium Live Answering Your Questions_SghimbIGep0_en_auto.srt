richardson

65
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,160
please uh please struggling with bad

66
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:13,440
fatigue but nothing ever shows up

67
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,879
any recommendations um

68
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,120
what happens with that fatigue no one

69
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:19,040
realizes this out there but that fatigue

70
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,440
means there's something going on and i

71
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,959
it's really bad fatigue i've always

72
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,360
taught doctors that that's

73
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,879
called neurological lyme it's something

74
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,720
i termed myself

75
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,160
between spirit of compassion and i and

76
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,760
so that neurological

77
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:35,040
that literal neurological um fatigue

78
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,920
you can use either get like a

79
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,760
neurological lyme diagnosis down the

80
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,760
road which you know you can get any kind

81
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,519
of diagnosis so that fatigue gets worse

82
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,720
and worse they just don't know

83
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,400
and they'll just be like well you got

84
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,239
the severe fatigue we're going to have

85
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,080
to give it a label eventually

86
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,760

00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:14,000
hypertension diagnosis incredible from

97
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:16,239
eating an mm diet that's amazing so that

98
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,560
that fatigue is like a neurological

99
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:21,760
fatigue that's what i call it it's very

100
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,760
deep it holds us back and

101
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,519
if you have that neurological fatigue i

102
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,400
almost lost my mind

103
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:31,440
i almost lost my book almost went over

104
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,959
my shoulder and down to the floor anyway

105
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,480
in here i talk about chronic fatigue

106
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,720
syndrome and

107
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,640
what to do and i tell doctors all the

108
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,159
time what it is it's epstein-barr virus

109
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,480
so it's the monovirus but

110
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:44,239
you can't get tested for it easy because

111
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,560
it's in a different stage

112
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,599
it's not in that beginning stage of mono

113
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,680
it's in

114
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,440
a later stage and when it's in later

115
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,120
stage you have this fatigue and it's

116
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:57,280
from your old mono you had

117
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:59,200
years ago and that's how it works um

118
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,319

planning on it

143
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,280
claudine iaw got my son to drink the

144
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,800
celery juice every morning

145
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:52,960
and his skin condition is clearing up

146
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,320
miracle and you know what's funny you

147
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:58,080
know what's funny about that

148
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,400
all these naysayers and health gurus

149
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,240
that

150
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,919
hate the fact that medical media put out

151
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,280
the celery juice in the world they hate

152
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:06,160
the fact that celery juice

153
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,680
has been dominating the health scene for

154
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,320
quite some time now

155
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,680
they hate it and so they'll tell people

156
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,280
stay away from celery juice you

157
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,280
shouldn't be juicing celery juice oh

158
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,840
it's got too much bad or it's not good

159
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,199
right

160
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:22,240
meanwhile they're stealing some

161
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,039
some child's chance of clearing up their

162
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,880
skin

163
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:29,440
or a child's chance of healing or

164
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,039
mommy's chance of healing or someone

165
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,080
getting their life back they're robbing

166
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,639
people of that

167
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,360
because they're demented or something

168
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,199
because

169
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,560
they don't want people to heal and

170
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,800
there's just something terribly wrong

171
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:44,639
about that

172
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:47,039
this is so cool um jennifer fonz do you

173
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:50,639
know anything about pots and how can i

174
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:52,000
help my daughter the thing is about pots

175
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,600
is pots as always and i've talked

176
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,440
about this the doc you could tell your

177
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,680
doctor this i talk to i teach doctors

178
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:01,039
this all the time pots is viral

179
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:04,560
and um so it's low grade viral so if

180
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:06,319
i had if i had a friend or

181
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,479
someone else is that they're dealing

182
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,919
with pots i always say we've got to go

183
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,560
anti-viral or at least

184
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:14,800
take away foods that could feed the

185
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,919
virus so maybe take the gluten away a

186
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,240
little bit

187
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:21,039
and just move it aside maybe do

188
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:24,080
gluten-free things that could be helpful

189
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:26,840
maybe do take away the dairy products

190
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,479
and the eggs a little bit bring in more

191
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:31,120
avocados

192
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:33,600
bring in more potatoes and that could be

193
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:36,479
helpful just these little switches alone

194
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,720
are really really helpful um and then

195
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:40,160
b12 is really important too you can ask

196
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:44,880
your doctor if this will

197
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:47,840

00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,199
about depression all the time

225
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:43,120
i have an anxiety show at medical media

226
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,560
podcast at apple podcast i have this

227
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,479
anxiety show that you might want to

228
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,199
listen to

229
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:50,960
meds and therapy no longer work any

230
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,120
suggestions i've tried anything

231
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,160
elizabeth if it was me that i had this

232
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,360
depression

233
00:07:54,160 --> 00:08:00,160
and i had this ptsd i would

234
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,000
i would try to get something called the

235
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:05,520
toxic heavy metals out of

236
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
my body because the reason why we have

237
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,360
this

238
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,680
mystery depression this mystery ptsd

239
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,599
and even mystery anxieties because we

240
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,879
have toxic heavy metals

241
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:18,319
inside our brain and to get that metal

242
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,680
out of our brain

243
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,680
we need to make sure we're doing like

244
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,639
the heavy metal detox movies and things

245
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,000
like that there's a

246
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:28,560
heavy metal detox cleansing here

247
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
this is what i would do and it's in here

248
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,360
to get metals out so you can put

249
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
depression behind you

250
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,039

251
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,760

252
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:39,519

science research doesn't know the cause

288
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,399

289
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,560

doctor wants us to try all these herbs

338
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,279
but it's all guessing games

339
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:20,959
and random crap everywhere but we're

340
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:23,200
still sick with our lupus

341
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,720
and how do we get better and in the end

342
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,320
many of them just take little tidbits

343
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,519
from original medical medium information

344
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,440
from 30 years ago

345
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,560
which is since i was there at the

346
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,240
beginning which is

347
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,079
get rid of gluten which came from

348
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,760
homemade really because no one was off

349
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:37,519
of gluten 35 years ago

350
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,800
and then do this and do this and this is

351
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,720
how it works and it's really kind of

352
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:44,160
crazy but what i'm saying is

353
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:45,839
it's not easy out there and

354
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:49,360

355
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:51,600
