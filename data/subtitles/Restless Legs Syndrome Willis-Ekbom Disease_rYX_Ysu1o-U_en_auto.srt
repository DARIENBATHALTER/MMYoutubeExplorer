1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:05,759
syndrome and the Brain saver books

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:09,000
comprehensive detailed information about

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:11,340
restless legs so let's get into it

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,840
restless leg syndrome often when

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:15,059
addressing restless legs medical

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:17,279
communities start with the legs first

7
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:18,660
are you cramping

8
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,400
what's going on with your legs do you

9
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:22,320
need leg massage do you need to lift

10
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,260
your legs up maybe your problems in your

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,420
legs but it's not right they'll ask

12
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:29,460
could that be the problem it's just a

13
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:32,040
leg problem try putting a pillow between

14
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:34,559
your legs when you sleep that'll fix it

15
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,719
how about that or the last how's your

16
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,960
bed and your mattress go out and buy

17
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:42,300
another 500 mattress or 300 400 whatever

18
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,280
it is dollar mattress and replace your

19
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:46,500
mattress that'll fix your restless legs

20
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,239
or your legs comfortable are they

21
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,879
supporting your lower back when you lie

22
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,379
down that's the problem you know experts

23
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,879
will be like maybe you just need a

24
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:55,440
little bit more support when you're in

25
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:56,940
bed maybe you could put your leg up

26
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,340
maybe you got your pillows between your

27
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:01,379
knees or right there a whole bit okay

28
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:03,420
how are your feet maybe your restless

29
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:05,100
leg syndrome is just your feet maybe you

30
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,320
got a feet problem you need to go and

31
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:10,020
try on some new shoes supportive shoes

32
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:12,180
do the shoes fit right do they have

33
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,920
enough padding are they the problem or

34
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:15,780
is one leg shorter than the other and

35
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,460
everybody says hey my leg is an inch

36
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,540
shorter than the other leg my legs I

37
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,939
have been shorter than the other leg

38
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:23,759
that must be my restless legs and then

39
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:25,979
so on so on if looking at the place

40
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,619
where the symptoms are felt doesn't

41
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:32,159
yield results then the doctor may move

42
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:33,540
on is it in your mind is your mind too

43
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,240
active at night are you giving

44
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:38,100
yourselves restless leg syndrome so then

45
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,720
you go through that whole thing is your

46
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:42,720
mind too active when you're trying to

47
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:44,280
sleep read a book read a book before you

48
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,799
go to bed right you might hear that

49
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,380
maybe light a candle and take a bath

50
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:52,140
listen to some calming music you'll hear

51
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:55,259
as advice consider taking magnesium for

52
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:57,960
your legs if none of this helps often

53
00:01:55,259 --> 00:02:00,600
patients are told it's time for an MRI

54
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:02,880
on their lower back to investigate for

55
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:06,299
degenerative disc problems or a bulging

56
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,740
disc and if this all checks out even if

57
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:09,360
there is something like a bulging disc

58
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:11,879
doesn't mean that's a restless legs if

59
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,860
this doesn't check out or checks out no

60
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:15,959
signs of structural spine issue the

61
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,400
restless legs will be considered a

62
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:19,860
medical mystery and that's the whole

63
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,440
point with restless legs it becomes a

64
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:25,020
medical mystery everybody thinks science

65
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,400
research is really advanced but they

66
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,379
don't even know the cause of restless

67
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,900
legs even here it's detailed

68
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:33,000
comprehensive information let's go on a

69
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,040
little further if looking at the place

70
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,200
where the symptoms are felt does it

71
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,599
yield those results instantly now we're

72
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,000
at the medical Mystery World and that's

73
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:44,700
really interesting so and here's the

74
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,540
other point that's interesting too

75
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:50,879
if there's no signs of anything wrong

76
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:52,500
your feet your legs you tried everything

77
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,420
you tried the pillows you tried the

78
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:57,660
shoes you went to the doctor you got

79
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:59,700
massage therapy it's not a mystery when

80
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:01,680
you look at the brain saver books it's a

81
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:03,300
medical mystery out there but detailed

82
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,060
information in here of what's really

83
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:07,920
going on is really incredible here there

84
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:10,080
are some neural neurologists these days

85
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,580
who will start looking into the brain a

86
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,260
little bit now I've seen that out there

87
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:15,599
because of the medical medium books

88
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:17,159
being out now for eight years they're

89
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:20,519
starting to look at the brain a little

90
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:22,860
bit right but even if the MRI and the

91
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:26,099
brain look normal there's nothing

92
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:28,319
abnormal there then where do they go

93
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:31,080
from there the true cause of restless

94
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:33,360
legs wouldn't it would not appear on the

95
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:35,819
MRI so let's go into that if you get an

96
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,319
MRI you're getting the restless legs for

97
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:39,120
like a year and it's bothering you you

98
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:40,799
tried everything you go to the doctor

99
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,680
the neurologist says let's look in the

100
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:46,260
brain they do an MRI they look for your

101
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,659
brain it looks pretty good nothing

102
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:51,659
really is terribly wrong in here okay

103
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:56,940
everything is checking out the brain

104
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:59,459
looks good nothing abnormal then

105
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:01,560
they're going to be like okay let's try

106
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:04,080
to go a different route let's go with

107
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,819
sleep medications let's start going with

108
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:09,840
different Pharmaceuticals they start

109
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:12,599
heading to that that place the true

110
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,640
cause of restless legs won't show up so

111
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:17,820
then they'll offer hey here's some sleep

112
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,680
aid here's a sleep drug have you tried

113
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:21,900
this have you tried that so then it's

114
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,880
going on to different places maybe you

115
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:26,520
got anxiety a lot of people with

116
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,720
restless legs are blamed on anxiety so

117
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,820
they're like well I don't know if it's

118
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:32,520
anxiety but maybe it is and now they're

119
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:35,580
taking anti-anxiety it's true you know

120
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:37,800
as well even if the scan showed a brain

121
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:40,139
tumor it wouldn't mean that that's the

122
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,820
cause and I run into that every now and

123
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:45,000
then throughout like talking to doctors

124
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:47,340
a doctor would be like hey aw there's a

125
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,080
brain tumor in my patient you know is

126
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:50,460
that causing the restless legs and well

127
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,960
first of all let's try to get rid of the

128
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:53,759
restless legs they get rid of the

129
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:56,340
restless legs and it turns out the brain

130
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,840
tumor wasn't causing the restless legs

131
00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:00,419
so

132
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,500
so even if someone has a lower back

133
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:03,720
issue

134
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:05,460
it doesn't mean the lower back issue is

135
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,199
the problem too someone could have a

136
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:09,900
bulging disc they could have a spine

137
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,460
issue they can have a sciatic nerve

138
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:13,680
problem they can have a degenerative

139
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:15,360
disc issue something can be wrong in

140
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,220
their lower spine right here and it

141
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,220
doesn't mean that that's actually

142
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:22,020
causing their restless legs so that's

143
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:23,880
another problem on its own so now you're

144
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:25,139
at the chiropractor and the chiropractor

145
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,520
is trying to do all kinds of stuff

146
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:29,400
saying well man

147
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:31,139
you know well sir your restless legs

148
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,759
probably because we're seeing there's an

149
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:35,039
inconsistency right here in your lower

150
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:37,080
spine in your lumbar or your thoracic

151
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:39,300
area that must be where your restless

152
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:42,240
legs are so they start searching in

153
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:43,620
those areas but even with that visiting

154
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,139
your chiropractor over and over again

155
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:47,820
visiting your massage therapist you've

156
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:50,639
been to the doctor you've had your MRIs

157
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:52,380
you've had a lot of things done and

158
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:56,220
looked at and you're still suffering

159
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:58,080
with restless legs let's go into now the

160
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:59,759
nitty-gritty and some details right here

161
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,880
so we're in brand saver talk about

162
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:06,479
restless legs you guys restless legs can

163
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:08,699
come from two places ah

164
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,800
first is the shingles virus releasing

165
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:13,139
neurotoxins that affect the lower spine

166
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:16,199
so let's head there

167
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:19,020
shingles virus likes to sit around the

168
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:21,300
lower spine for a lot of people it's

169
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:23,759
likes to Harbor in this area the

170
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:26,759
shingles virus can Nest itself in

171
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:29,400
connective tissue around the lower spine

172
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:32,580
then release neurotoxins these

173
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:35,100
neurotoxins can then inflame the sciatic

174
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:38,460
nerve other nerves too so the shingles

175
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:42,660
virus without having the pustules like

176
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:44,520
the rash can cause those restless legs

177
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:46,800
this is one of the Undiscovered

178
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:49,080
mysteries of restless legs which is the

179
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:52,020
neurotoxins created by the shingles

180
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:54,360
virus produced by the shingles virus

181
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:56,160
sitting inside the liver is is another

182
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,680
problem so the shingles virus doesn't

183
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,960
just harbor around the lower spine the

184
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:03,120
shingles virus likes to sit around the

185
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,460
liver too so not just the lower spine

186
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:08,940
shingles virus likes to sit around the

187
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:11,580
liver as well inside the liver producing

188
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:15,000
neurotoxins and those neurotoxins start

189
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:16,560
to gum up and fill up the liver so when

190
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,300
that liver gets filled with neurotoxins

191
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,699
we have another problem

192
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:22,740
so the liver can settle in different

193
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:24,319
places the neurotoxins can settle in

194
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:27,180
different places inside the liver

195
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,740
depending on what those neurotoxins are

196
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:30,599
filled with so here's the incredible

197
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:32,819
piece of information too right here in

198
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:33,720
brain saver so we're in the details you

199
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:37,020
guys

200
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:39,720
higher amounts of lead and copper being

201
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:42,720
consumed by the shingles virus will

202
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:47,039
result in a heavier neurotoxin so check

203
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:51,419
this out if the virus is feeding off of

204
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:55,560
different Metals it can actually create

205
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:57,720
a heavier neurotoxin so if the virus is

206
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:01,259
sitting here feeding off of different

207
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:03,960
Metals it could then produce a waste

208
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:06,660
that comes out of the shingles virus but

209
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:09,599
a waste that's heavier and when that

210
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:12,180
waste is heavier check this out this is

211
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:14,819
incredible really this is how you become

212
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:16,860
your own expert right here

213
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:19,319
if higher amounts of lead and copper

214
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:22,020
being consumed by the shingles virus are

215
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:25,560
happening then those heavier neurotoxins

216
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:27,539
tend to settle in lower areas

217
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:29,940
they'll often drop into the lower back

218
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:32,520
legs and feet irritating the nerves and

219
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:35,580
creating subtle spasms so if you have

220
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:37,500
certain toxic heavy metals and the

221
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:40,500
shingles virus is feeding off of those

222
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:43,380
Metals those metals neurotoxins are

223
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:45,779
being released they settle in lower

224
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:48,480
areas of the body

225
00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:51,180
feet the legs the lower back irritating

226
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:54,300
the nerves creating nerve spasms giving

227
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:56,640
somebody restless legs signs of research

228
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:58,320
is probably 50 60 years from knowing

229
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,540
this information maybe even a hundred

230
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,339
years some varieties of Epstein-Barr can

231
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:05,040
also create these heavier types of

232
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:07,680
neurotoxins as well so Epstein-Barr can

233
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,660
create heavy neurotoxins people can have

234
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,240
restless legs all day long while

235
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:15,240
standing and working or sitting and not

236
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,560
realize it until they're still or lying

237
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,779
down for the night so let's talk about

238
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:21,180
that are you somebody with restless leg

239
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:24,120
syndrome when it's at night and you're

240
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:26,459
trying to sleep but during the day when

241
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:29,220
you're working moving around working in

242
00:09:26,459 --> 00:09:31,380
the kitchen maybe doing your job it's

243
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:33,240
not bothering you like where's your

244
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:35,160
restless leg syndrome so here you are

245
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,380
you're living your life it's during the

246
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:39,420
day you're working you're in the kitchen

247
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:41,519
washing stuff you're doing things you're

248
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:43,860
doing the laundry you're walking around

249
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:46,860
the house where's your restless legs is

250
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:50,700
it there or is it not but then when you

251
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:52,680
lay down and it's sleep time you get the

252
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:55,080
restless legs

253
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:57,540
so people can have the restless legs all

254
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:59,519
day long while standing working or

255
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:02,100
sitting and not realize it until they're

256
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:04,080
still are laying down for the night

257
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:06,180
here's the other way restless legs can

258
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:09,360
occur viral neurotoxins filled the same

259
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:10,980
methylated metals can enter the brain so

260
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,440
then we can get

261
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:16,440
a restless leg syndrome some viral

262
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,420
neurotoxins entering the brain

263
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:20,339
that's a whole nother level of

264
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:22,260
neurotoxins you guys there's so much

265
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:24,060
information in here I'm just cutting

266
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:26,580
into some of some it's you know

267
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:29,459
scratching the surface restless legs

268
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:32,459
protocol is in this book right here

269
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:34,680
so there are two books two big books

270
00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:36,240
couldn't be published as one big book it

271
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,680
was too big too much comprehensive

272
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,860
information

273
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:43,620
seven heavy metal detox cleanses over

274
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:46,620
300 symptoms conditions and protocols

275
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:48,240
brain shot therapies and I'm just

276
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:49,860
scratching the surface of these books I

277
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,200
mean there's meditations in these books

278
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:54,899
there's so much information it's so

279
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:56,640
comprehensive your mind will be blown

280
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:59,339
when you get into this but I will tell

281
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:01,680
you right now be prepared to become an

282
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:04,200
expert so nobody owns you you're not

283
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,540
controlled by anybody you become

284
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:08,880
empowered because you have the answers

285
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:12,800
you have the details your mind's going
