[653.28 - 657.92] i'm gonna put the cabbage in a little
[654.88 - 662.16] later like the recipe calls
[657.92 - 662.16] okay all right
[662.32 - 666.96] i'm gonna put the um dill and the
[664.88 - 671.60] parsley a little bit later
[666.96 - 673.60] okay lorraine can celery force replace
[671.60 - 674.08] celery juice when needed it can't
[673.60 - 677.28] replace
[674.08 - 677.76] it celery force is i mean i use it every
[677.28 - 682.08] day
[677.76 - 684.96] okay it it wakes up my mind
[682.08 - 686.64] and that's kind of scary because my
[684.96 - 687.68] friends and family tell me my mind's
[686.64 - 690.56] already away
[687.68 - 692.48] you know awake in the sense where i'm
[690.56 - 694.72] going going going going and
[692.48 - 696.16] you know like all day and i don't stop
[694.72 - 698.24] and i'm on the phone and everything
[696.16 - 700.56] and that's without celery force but i
[698.24 - 703.84] take celery force myself personally
[700.56 - 706.32] when i get three hours of sleep at night
[703.84 - 707.36] not because i can't sleep but because i
[706.32 - 710.40] push myself
[707.36 - 712.16] to the limit to a dangerous limit
[710.40 - 713.52] and with all the information i got to
[712.16 - 714.96] put out with the books i'm trying to
[713.52 - 718.16] write everything right
[714.96 - 720.32] and so what i'll do is i'll like uh
[718.16 - 721.92] spirit is it is it okay is it okay if i
[720.32 - 724.16] take some celery force right now
[721.92 - 725.84] it's rid of compassion soc is like go
[724.16 - 727.36] ahead take it i know you're only on
[725.84 - 727.76] three hours two and a half hours of
[727.36 - 729.20] sleep
[727.76 - 730.48] but take it you can push yourself a
[729.20 - 732.32] little harder if that's what you want to
[730.48 - 733.92] do but take the celery force
[732.32 - 735.92] next thing you know two and a half hours

[821.20 - 826.00] that end up on things that died right
[824.32 - 827.44] because because a fermented vegetable

[866.00 - 870.16] they end up on the parsley it's like a
[868.48 - 871.68] miracle they appear

[883.68 - 889.44] after the death the death

[889.44 - 893.12] things that
[890.00 - 897.04] die when something dies right
[893.12 - 898.40] when a body dies all that stuff starts
[897.04 - 901.92] happening when an
[898.40 - 904.88] animal dies all this stuff starts
[901.92 - 905.20] happening it's all microorganisms that
[904.88 - 908.00] we
[905.20 - 909.04] that don't do anything for us except for
[908.00 - 910.88] devour
[909.04 - 912.40] things that have died and that's the
[910.88 - 913.12] mess up with fermented foods and i talk
[912.40 - 915.68] about
[913.12 - 917.44] why people do why fermented foods is so
[915.68 - 920.56] old in culture right
[917.44 - 920.96] it's ancient it was to survive crops so
[920.56 - 922.88] because
[920.96 - 924.08] at the end of the year you died if you
[922.88 - 924.96] didn't have any food throughout the
[924.08 - 926.80] winter
[924.96 - 928.32] so you had to throw everything you had
[926.80 - 931.68] in the garden in a giant
[928.32 - 934.16] vat in hopes to god that it preserves
[931.68 - 936.40] through a process of the micro
[934.16 - 937.52] microorganisms just eating away at it
[936.40 - 940.32] right just keeping that
[937.52 - 942.24] slop that stinky slop alive that
[940.32 - 943.36] fermented slop alive right
[942.24 - 945.04] and then you think the the
[943.36 - 946.64] microorganisms are giving you all this
[945.04 - 949.76] stuff but that's not how it works
[946.64 - 952.64] it's just a preserved technique for for
[949.76 - 954.32] villages 2 000 years ago that knew there
[952.64 - 956.64] would be no food for the winter i took
[954.32 - 959.92] all about it in here
[956.64 - 962.08] suzanna asked for a half file of blood
[959.92 - 963.92] being drawn tech asked if i was
[962.08 - 967.04] following mm
[963.92 - 969.20] that's insane yes

[998.00 - 1002.44] why would someone without a thyroid have
[1000.08 - 1006.96] hashimoto's antibodies
[1002.44 - 1008.88] exactly why would they
[1006.96 - 1011.12] the reason why they would is because
[1008.88 - 1013.52] hashimoto's thyroiditis is nothing like
[1011.12 - 1015.60] anybody knows
[1013.52 - 1017.60] hashimoto's thyroiditis is a mystery to
[1015.60 - 1020.80] medical research and science
[1017.60 - 1023.44] they don't know what it is okay but
[1020.80 - 1024.96] it's epstein-barr virus thyroid or no
[1023.44 - 1026.56] thyroid you're still going to have the
[1024.96 - 1028.56] epstein-barr virus
[1026.56 - 1029.68] see the epstein-barr virus caused the
[1028.56 - 1031.52] thyroid to begin with
[1029.68 - 1033.12] we end up having your thyroids removed
[1031.52 - 1035.68] because of epstein-barr
[1033.12 - 1037.68] that's how how it works epstein-barr
[1035.68 - 1039.28] gets into the thyroid causes thyroid
[1037.68 - 1041.20] problems thyroid diseases thyroid
[1039.28 - 1042.80] conditions we end up losing thyroids
[1041.20 - 1045.36] many times we don't have a thyroid
[1042.80 - 1047.52] anymore afterwards and then
[1045.36 - 1048.80] we end up still keeping the epstein bar
[1047.52 - 1049.52] it's in her system and that's why it's
[1048.80 - 1051.44] critical
[1049.52 - 1052.88] to work on healing it take this to your
[1051.44 - 1054.96] doctor if you want the medical medium
[1052.88 - 1056.40] revised and expanded if you guys don't
[1054.96 - 1057.68] have this book you should get it

[1071.04 - 1075.36] seen them do 12
[1072.08 - 1077.04] tubes this big but but

[1077.04 - 1082.96] take easily they'll take five vials six
[1079.12 - 1085.92] vial seven vials boom boom boom boom
[1082.96 - 1086.80] raw reiki i tried celery juice years ago

[1120.08 - 1124.00] even though what even though aw in his
[1122.40 - 1126.00] book says just don't mix it with
[1124.00 - 1129.12] anything
[1126.00 - 1132.32] but it might help it's gonna make the
[1129.12 - 1134.84] celery juice not work really so the
[1132.32 - 1138.08] celery just won't work
[1134.84 - 1141.84] okay all right

[1513.20 - 1517.12] chickenpox are not the same
[1515.04 - 1519.28] they're two different viruses if the

[1519.28 - 1525.44] easy and brainwash
[1522.64 - 1527.20] generations of people so that your

[1549.04 - 1552.88] i obviously don't own that word
[1550.72 - 1553.84] misinformation but it's the one i used
[1552.88 - 1556.56] in the health scene
[1553.84 - 1558.56] no one used the word i used it for years
[1556.56 - 1560.80] in health misinformation right

[1580.32 - 1585.52] everybody's different
[1581.76 - 1588.64] i'll tell you why everybody's different
[1585.52 - 1590.00] because you may have something else
[1588.64 - 1592.72] happening you may have
[1590.00 - 1594.32] a streptococcus a different variety you
[1592.72 - 1594.88] may have an epstein-barr a different
[1594.32 - 1596.72] variety
[1594.88 - 1598.56] you may have a shingles and epson bar
[1596.72 - 1600.80] and some mercury you may have
[1598.56 - 1602.16] copper no mercury and some aluminum
[1600.80 - 1604.72] meaning low in the mercury
[1602.16 - 1605.68] you may be high in aluminum high in
[1604.72 - 1608.16] copper
[1605.68 - 1609.12] low in mercury right and then have a
[1608.16 - 1611.28] little bit of lead
[1609.12 - 1612.56] okay someone might have a bug that's a
[1611.28 - 1614.00] little bit more annoying
[1612.56 - 1615.68] a little bit more aggressive one of the
[1614.00 - 1617.28] 60 varieties of epsilon bar
[1615.68 - 1618.80] someone might have three varieties of
[1617.28 - 1619.44] epstein-barr someone might have a
[1618.80 - 1621.20] simplex
[1619.44 - 1623.68] a cytomegalovirus three varieties of
[1621.20 - 1627.04] epstein-barr two shingles varieties
[1623.68 - 1629.84] three streptococcus and and a
[1627.04 - 1630.24] whole bunch of mercury and just mercury
[1629.84 - 1632.96] right
[1630.24 - 1634.96] low on some other stuff and someone
[1632.96 - 1636.64] might have emotional hardships
[1634.96 - 1638.48] someone else might have financial
[1636.64 - 1640.72] hardships someone else might have
[1638.48 - 1642.08] different pathogens different toxins
[1640.72 - 1644.08] somebody might have more pesticides
[1642.08 - 1645.84] herbicides fungicides somebody might be
[1644.08 - 1647.20] living in a place with air fresheners
[1645.84 - 1649.76] and scented candles
[1647.20 - 1651.84] somebody might be working in a gas
[1649.76 - 1653.44] station and they breathe in gas and get
[1651.84 - 1656.64] it on their hands every day
[1653.44 - 1658.56] it's it's it's an endless combination
[1656.64 - 1660.40] right someone might be eating lots of
[1658.56 - 1661.60] eggs every single day and someone might
[1660.40 - 1664.32] not be eating many at
[1661.60 - 1666.32] all it matters someone might be doing a
[1664.32 - 1668.16] lot of caffeine throughout their life
[1666.32 - 1669.92] and someone else might not be doing any
[1668.16 - 1671.84] caffeine throughout their life okay
[1669.92 - 1673.20] do you see what i'm saying this is what
[1671.84 - 1676.40] matters so why
[1673.20 - 1678.16] why does all this matter it all matters
[1676.40 - 1680.32] because the medical medium books are
[1678.16 - 1683.44] geared with a thousand protocols
[1680.32 - 1684.96] to take somebody to the end for one you
[1683.44 - 1686.08] can get rid of your eggs your dairy

[1795.60 - 1800.32] use i mean doesn't make any sense and
[1798.32 - 1803.04] i'm not sponsored i'm just saying
[1800.32 - 1804.56] um anyway there's no preservatives no
[1803.04 - 1806.56] alcohol in these the quality is
[1804.56 - 1809.12] incredible and that's the whole point
[1806.56 - 1810.80] and um no natural flavors but anyway so

[1810.80 - 1814.32] vimergy lemon balm it's in here so for

[1829.84 - 1834.00] micro c so i got that
[1832.56 - 1836.16] i'm just saying you go through here
[1834.00 - 1838.08] there's there's you can start with one
[1836.16 - 1839.84] thing in the supplements list you can
[1838.08 - 1841.44] start with just celery
[1839.84 - 1843.68] but that's the whole point you can go as
[1841.44 - 1844.64] far as you need to go but if you're
[1843.68 - 1846.64] going to use
[1844.64 - 1848.24] supplements that aren't good or high
[1846.64 - 1849.84] quality then that's going to slow you
[1848.24 - 1851.60] down too you see the differences

[2214.08 - 2216.24] protein that night this thing's gonna
[2215.52 - 2219.28] hold you
[2216.24 - 2221.04] over and then some you know
[2219.28 - 2222.32] even more than animal protein really if
[2221.04 - 2223.60] you're a plant-based
[2222.32 - 2225.76] person you don't have to put a whole
[2223.60 - 2229.20] bunch of fat in this this is fat-free
[2225.76 - 2230.48] now if um
[2229.20 - 2232.64] that's the whole point we're keeping the
