1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,439
we're talking about skin problems

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:05,319
because one thing that's getting worse

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:08,000
with health with everybody these days

4
00:00:05,319 --> 00:00:11,040
every single five years that passes is

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,240
skin problems people's skin is falling

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,040
apart out there that's all you hear out

7
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:17,560
there now they got this problem they got

8
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,480
dark spots they got all kinds of acne

9
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:21,840
they got all kinds of scarring they have

10
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:23,680
to get exfoliations they got to get you

11
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:27,039
know all kinds of different facial care

12
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:30,160
skin care because people's skin is

13
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:32,719
getting worse than it was years ago like

14
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:35,239
years ago 20 years ago even 10 years ago

15
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:37,239
we had a fraction of the skin problems

16
00:00:35,239 --> 00:00:40,280
we have today we're talking about the

17
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:44,160
medical medium Skin Potion it is

18
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:47,079
something that just works hands down

19
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:49,719
just the facts just the record it

20
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:51,360
actually works and so one thing I'm

21
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:53,199
going to do is make the Skin Potion but

22
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,239
I want to just move over real quick to a

23
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:56,640
quick announcement I'm going to be

24
00:00:55,239 --> 00:01:00,440
speaking in

25
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,000
Colorado at the Gaia heel conference I

26
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,760
don't know if you guys got a ticket if

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,799
you already did that already if you're

28
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,520
coming but it's going to be exciting

29
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:09,000
because I'm doing a light blast but I

30
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,720
just have to forewarn anybody who's

31
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,680
coming it's a high altitude light blast

32
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:17,200
it's there's a big difference and um I

33
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:21,400
guess what I'm trying to say right now

34
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:23,400
is if you're in that audience there Live

35
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:26,320
while we're doing the High Altitude

36
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,159
light blast it's going to be intense so

37
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,119
I'm kind of giving you a little

38
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:31,000
forewarning I feel like I have to it's

39
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:33,439
my responsibility

40
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,399
um high altitude light blast means the

41
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:38,360
light hits you from a little bit of an

42
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:42,759
angle and it hits you faster a little

43
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:45,880
bit harder because we're 5,000 plus feet

44
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:47,600
above sea level so what happens is with

45
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:49,399
the normal light blast which is still

46
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,000
intense where there's Miracle healings

47
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:54,680
Miracle changes in people's lives with

48
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,439
that one the light when it finally hits

49
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:59,960
it hits a little bit softer and it's a

50
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:02,640
little bit less intense and it comes

51
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:04,520
Direct on top of the crown of the head

52
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,960
with something like the Colorado light

53
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:09,599
light blast the last time I did a light

54
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:10,920
blast in Colorado was maybe N9 years ago

55
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:12,720
I think it was N9 years ago could have

56
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:14,959
been 10 years ago like don't quote me on

57
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,920
that part exactly the month or the year

58
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,440
but close to 10 years ago and that's the

59
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:21,480
last time I did the light blast a high

60
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:23,920
altitude light blast in Colorado it was

61
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:26,160
in Denver at the time and people were

62
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,560
just they were hit hard it was an

63
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,800
incredible experience the whole bit now

64
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,080
I don't live in Colorado

65
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,400
doesn't mean I'm not going to eventually

66
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:37,360
think about maybe getting a place in

67
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:40,120
Colorado and living there for a while

68
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:43,480
it's very possible but um as of right

69
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:45,519
now I don't so like I said the last high

70
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:48,440
altitude light blast was a decade ago

71
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,159
and this one is coming up so November

72
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:52,040
9th I think that's the date you can

73
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:54,080
still get a ticket you can still be

74
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:55,599
there we still got some time I'm going

75
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,599
to do a lecture I'm going to talk about

76
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:59,360
some pretty intense things it's going to

77
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:01,640
be a little bit of a different kind of

78
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,799
talk and a little different speech from

79
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,840
s so it's going to be pretty intense

80
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:07,200
really it's going to be a lot of other

81
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:09,440
speakers too so if you had a chance or

82
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,560
if you're going you won't be

83
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,959
disappointed uh you won't be

84
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:16,280
disappointed I can tell you that like

85
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:18,680
true medical medium fashion it's not

86
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:21,480
going to disappoint anyway back to the

87
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,720
Skin Potion so there's skin problems

88
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:25,599
everywhere out there it's a serious

89
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,920
issue not just xoras not just dermatitis

90
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,439
not just bumps and all kinds of

91
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:31,000
different things not just

92
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:33,200
detoxifications of people skin and other

93
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,040
issues and skin Cancers and all kinds of

94
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,159
different stuff people are going through

95
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:40,519
that's getting worse skin problems are

96
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:42,439
on the rise people want their skin to

97
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:46,519
look good and what you'll notice in the

98
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:50,560
skin world is you'll notice 22-year-old

99
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:53,599
models modeling for skin products 22

100
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:56,439
years old or 20 years old or 24 years

101
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:58,920
old and you know that's that's kind of

102
00:03:56,439 --> 00:04:00,599
like a tricky situation when a model

103
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:03,799
who's 22 years old who's getting

104
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:06,840
exfoliations and using so many different

105
00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:10,319
creams and buttercreams and ointments

106
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:12,400
and all kinds of different um facials in

107
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,959
the whole bit and they're 20 years old

108
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,720
or 22 years old and they're trying to

109
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,799
sell a skin product or say their skin

110
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:23,320
looks good it's kind of a joke and no no

111
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:25,120
no disrespect on any level no insults

112
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:28,960
nothing like that that's not what it's

113
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:31,880
about it's just kind of observation of

114
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:34,360
reality of how it works and so you know

115
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:37,360
so the skin Market has really been taken

116
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:40,120
over by the 20-year-old or the 19 or

117
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,400
24-year-old who is getting a tremendous

118
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:45,240
amount of you know applications on their

119
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:47,520
face and skin work and their 20 so you

120
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,080
got to think about that right now and

121
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,560
the 22-year-old who's suffering with

122
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:54,320
skin problems isn't going to be the

123
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:57,080
model modeling skin ointments and skin

124
00:04:54,320 --> 00:05:00,479
care and so forth doesn't work like that

125
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:03,120
so the models chosen to sell skin

126
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:05,720
products are models that already don't

127
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,520
have any skin problems to begin with and

128
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:09,759
they're 20 years old and they have no

129
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:14,479
skin problems yeah those are the ones

130
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:15,720
chosen to do skin product modeling stuff

131
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:17,240
and they're still getting their

132
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,639
exfoliations and their facials and

133
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,759
everything else and applying a whole

134
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,919
bunch of different stuff they have so

135
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:24,759
many techniques right it's all about

136
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:26,600
that so I I'm talking about serious

137
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:28,319
stuff I'm talking about any kind of skin

138
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:30,639
problems and stuff that people develop

139
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:31,960
over time and the irony is if you take

140
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,360
somebody who doesn't have skin problems

141
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,400
and they're 20 years old what are they

142
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,400
going to look like when they're 40 how

143
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,919
are they taking care of themselves do

144
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,479
they have the medical medium tools

145
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:42,319
because yeah everything just seems to

146
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,880
fall apart on everybody and that's how

147
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:47,560
it rolls out

148
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:50,199
there one thing about skin which is

149
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:53,960
critical as antioxidants you want good

150
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:56,440
skin you have to be doing antioxidants

151
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:58,120
just keep that in mind right there that

152
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,919
is a big one you'll hear a lot of

153
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:02,199
different stuff out there like this and

154
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:05,160
this about skin and all that it's like

155
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:08,199
antioxidants are the critical piece you

156
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:11,039
want less skin problems you want your

157
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:13,160
skin to heal one thing you'll never see

158
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:15,240
me promoting is that whole thing with

159
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:17,120
the roller with all the little tiny

160
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,039
prickly things on there and people are

161
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,800
doing this micro needling or whatever

162
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:23,599
it's called right was never a fan of the

163
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,039
micro needling thing where you're

164
00:06:23,599 --> 00:06:26,639
sitting there and you're just you know

165
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:29,599
you're rolling that thing on your face

166
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:31,199
and you're doing this terrible idea now

167
00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:32,960
that's the problem with the world of

168
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,120
Health it's the Wild Wild West I'll say

169
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,880
it over and over again where pretty much

170
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,440
anybody comes up with a cocka manyy

171
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,199
[ __ ] terrible idea puts it out there

172
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,880
seems like a good idea and everybody's

173
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,360
using it and they're micro needling and

174
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,240
what they're doing is they're destroying

175
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,680
their underneath their their bottom not

176
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,759
the bottom but the middle layer of their

177
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,319
Derma they're making it so they can get

178
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:54,440
Scar Tissue on their face so one of the

179
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,319
whole things about that micro needling

180
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:58,680
and it might not even be called micro

181
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,599
needling I'm so not into that that I

182
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:04,160
kind of left that out of my

183
00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:05,720
Consciousness you know what I mean but

184
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,199
that whole thing with the roller with

185
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:10,120
all the different little tiny needles on

186
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:11,639
it where they don't go that deep but

187
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:16,080
they go deep enough and you roll your

188
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:17,919
face with it that was purported to say

189
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,680
well what happens is you're fixing all

190
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:22,440
kinds of scar tissue and all kinds of

191
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,680
stuff like that no no no no I should do

192
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:28,160
a podcast about that I really should

193
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:30,160
there's only so many damaging and and um

194
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,720
uh problematic things I can do podcast

195
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,919
about if you heard my last podcast I

196
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,879
don't know if you heard the last one I

197
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:38,440
just put it out there medical Me podcast

198
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:40,440
go to Spotify go to Apple and you can

199
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:42,599
hear that last one it's just

200
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:45,520
mind-blowing the the things that people

201
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:48,080
do that is not good for them and all

202
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,759
that so the problem is when you do that

203
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,159
roller like that and you're you're

204
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,840
so-called stimulating so you can get

205
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:55,680
collagen growth first of all collagen

206
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,720
doesn't grow because of that collagen

207
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,479
doesn't grow like that you can't take

208
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,400
collagen to fix your collagen and you

209
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:04,280
you can't rub something on your face or

210
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:06,440
prick your face with a prickly device

211
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:09,240
you can't do that to grow your col

212
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:12,560
collagen it doesn't work at all it's not

213
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:15,960
how it um it's not how it

214
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:18,800
rolls so we'll talk about this too for a

215
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:20,360
little bit vitamin C if you just got

216
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:24,520
here you see some products in front of

217
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:26,039
you see the micro C okay that is part of

218
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,560
the Skin Potion the medical medium Skin

219
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:30,120
Potion there's a reason for it so that's

220
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:32,880
the micro immune power

221
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:37,479
immune power your

222
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:40,839
skin has an immune system there your

223
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:43,640
skin has to have one of the strongest

224
00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:45,320
parts of your immune system it's there

225
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:47,040
so you don't get infections when you get

226
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,560
cut so you don't die of blood poisoning

227
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,760
which is bacterial infection so you

228
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:53,279
don't die of sepsis your skin is your

229
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:55,760
protector from sepsis and so forth but

230
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:58,600
it's your Skin's immune system that's a

231
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,600
protector from sepsis and other issues

232
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:03,800
like that and infections and so forth

233
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:07,519
and constant staff infections and

234
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:09,720
everything and super bugs like Mera MRSA

235
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:12,279
right all that stuff so your skin is

236
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:16,000
your protector it's the sleeve over our

237
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:18,519
bodies and to keep our skin strong and

238
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,200
healthy and this is important to know

239
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:23,279
you have to have antioxidants if you're

240
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:26,760
a skin person if you're into skin if you

241
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:29,360
want to protect your skin it is critical

242
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:31,079
that you have the antioxidants and now

243
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,720
running out and going get get some

244
00:09:31,079 --> 00:09:35,920
vitamin C out there might not be the

245
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,920
answer either because a

246
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:49,959
scorpicol it with skin cancers it's out

247
00:09:47,079 --> 00:09:52,760
of control skin cancers are on the rise

248
00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:55,320
they are on the rise eczema psoriasis

249
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:56,959
dermatitis Vitiligo is on the rise and

250
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,120
it's not going to be going anywhere

251
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,839
anytime soon in fact not only is it not

252
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,560
going to be going anywhere anytime soon

253
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:04,800
it's going to get out of control to a

254
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:09,320
level no one's ever even

255
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:11,519
seen it's going to be really really bad

256
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:13,360
so when it comes down to your skin you

257
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,480
have to have your immune system attack

258
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,680
attacked immune system attacked right

259
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:20,800
ATT intact and you have that's why I

260
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:22,480
like doing live you got to do it live

261
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,480
because if something happens or you say

262
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,600
something this whatever man you do the

263
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,600
best you can but you have to have your

264
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,720
immune system working it has to be

265
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:32,079
strong but in order order to keep your

266
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:34,200
immune system strong and take care of it

267
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,959
you have to feed it it's critical it

268
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:39,040
gets vitamin C it gets those

269
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:41,800
antioxidants that's a big deal skin your

270
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,440
immune system antioxidants and then you

271
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,760
can choose the different antioxidants

272
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,920
you can take you can find different

273
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:50,160
forms of antioxidants out there my

274
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:55,480
favorite is vitamin C vitamin C so says

275
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:58,920
is is the strongest and best skin

276
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:02,160
healer that's it bottom line if you

277
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:06,760
don't have vitamin C in your diet on any

278
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:11,000
level you die you die that's

279
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:12,519
it yeah you die your body falls apart

280
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,200
little bit after a little bit your

281
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:19,000
organs fall apart you go into organ

282
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:21,399
failure your skin falls apart first and

283
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,079
you die that's what happens without

284
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:26,240
vitamin

285
00:11:23,079 --> 00:11:28,600
C science of research had to discover

286
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,959
vitamin C because they were forced to

287
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,920
keep that in mind this is important they

288
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:34,279
were forced to I just saw somebody say

289
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:37,480
what kind of vitamin C is that we're

290
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:41,120

works and you guys know I endorse these

295
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,880
guys because of what they're doing and

296
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,600
wait till you hear about how it works

297
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:55,800

298
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,800
vitamin C it's important if you care

299
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,440
about your skin this is important I know

300
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,279
there's so much [ __ ] going on out there

301
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,279
there's so many different things out

302
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:06,000
there and it's hard to even decipher

303
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:09,279
what's what but I'm letting you know if

304
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,680
you at all care about your skin at all

305
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:13,320
you care about your skin even the

306
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:15,040
slightest bit it's important it's

307
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:17,920
imperative that you understand what this

308
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:21,040
ISS the Skin Potion right and how it

309
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:23,120
works without vitamin C we die we cease

310
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:26,920
to exist our bodies fall apart and

311
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:29,639
that's it see you later that's it the

312
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:31,320
door closes you're gone now what happens

313
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:33,519
without vitamin C science was forced to

314
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:37,519
figure this out because people are going

315
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:39,880
on Long ship rides long boat rides

316
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:43,160
without a squeeze of lemon without a

317
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:44,800
piece of fruit without a fresh vegetable

318
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:47,240
that has vitamin C like just broccoli

319
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:52,240
alone is loaded with vitamin C people

320
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:54,000
were going on Long ship rides and dying

321
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,560
they were dying their bodies were

322
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,240
falling apart they were getting scurvy

323
00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:00,040
their skin was falling off their bodies

324
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:03,279
it was growing thin by the month and

325
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:05,199
just opened up so what happens is if you

326
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:08,079
don't have vitamin C in your diet and

327
00:13:05,199 --> 00:13:11,720
your skin decides to just just fall

328
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:16,279
apart and open that says a lot right

329
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:20,600
there it's a big deal skin and Vitamin C

330
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:23,519
go hand in hand hand in hand very

331
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:26,720
important to know people who have less

332
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:29,639
vitamin C in their diet their skin gets

333
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:33,519
cruder cruder cruder and cruder and as

334
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:37,839
they grow older it gets thin as heck

335
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:40,639
their skin gets so thin tears gets

336
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:43,240
thin that's what happens to skin when

337
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:46,079
you don't have enough vitamin C or years

338
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:47,880
enough of vitamin C so you can help

339
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:51,120
rebuild

340
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:53,720
collagen and help restore collagen and

341
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:56,079
help restore your Skin's layers in your

342
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:59,240
skin surface and the Deep

343
00:13:56,079 --> 00:14:01,079
Derma so this is a little skin talk cuz

344
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:02,920
I think it's important so people know

345
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:06,399
these differences and understand what's

346
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:09,560
going on science was forced to find

347
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:11,160
vitamin C they had no choice they needed

348
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:14,240
to know why people were dying from a

349
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:16,519
Long Boat Ride they needed to understand

350
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,240
that they also needed to understand that

351
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:20,800
if someone was fed a certain amount of

352
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,639
food for a certain amount of time and

353
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:25,759
had a problem where their body fell

354
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:27,279
apart they needed to understand that too

355
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:29,079
one of the things they were looking for

356
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:31,519
and they thought was the Panacea was V

357
00:14:29,079 --> 00:14:33,199
vitamin A they thought vitamin A was

358
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,880
everything that vitamin A was the

359
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:37,320
survival of

360
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:40,240
humankind and they thought that removing

361
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:44,600
vitamin A or diets of no vitamin

362
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:47,680
A was the reason why people were falling

363
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:51,440
apart with their health but they were

364
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:53,399
wrong vitamin A wasn't the Panacea of

365
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,519
Everybody's Health it wasn't a make or

366
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:57,720
break we're talking about a make or

367
00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:00,959
break there's a big difference right

368
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:03,279
there make a

369
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:05,279
break one of the reasons why they

370
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:07,160
figured out vitamin A wasn't the answer

371
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:09,480
is they put some people on just straight

372
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,480
white

373
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:15,000
rice and

374
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:18,120
they didn't survive and then they put

375
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,440
other people in straight white rice

376
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,800
processed white

377
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,839
rice and they did survive and they're

378
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:25,920
like how is it where one person survives

379
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:28,600
one person

380
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:30,959
doesn't and they were doing vitamin A

381
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:32,480
with both and what happens is when

382
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,240
they're doing vitamin A with both and

383
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,519
they

384
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:37,120
realized some people survive some people

385
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,399
don't survive they found out that one of

386
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,440
the people one of the groups of people

387
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:42,399
that were

388
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:44,319
surviving were eating other

389
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,800
things and they're like well let's look

390
00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:48,680
at the other things they ate and what

391
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:51,079
they found was it was vitamin

392
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,759
C the whole thing about not having

393
00:15:51,079 --> 00:15:55,440
vitamin C in your diet for a long time

394
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:58,720
and your body falling apart and

395
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:01,040
dying is something they found out also

396
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:03,079
with the ships that I talk about taking

397
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,759
boat rides long boat rides in the ocean

398
00:16:03,079 --> 00:16:07,120
3 months four months five months 6

399
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:10,040
months out at Sea eight months out at

400
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:11,160
Sea and then everybody just falls apart

401
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:13,959
and that's

402
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:16,079
that they were forced to over time find

403
00:16:13,959 --> 00:16:17,440
out that we had to have vitamin C they

404
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:19,480
had to search for it it was the search

405
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,319
for vitamin C vitamin A was no longer

406
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:22,519
the big thing it was like okay vitamin A

407
00:16:21,319 --> 00:16:24,839
and everybody thought that's the answer

408
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:26,800
but no it was vitamin C in order to stay

409
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:28,639
alive and stay healthy and be alive

410
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:31,160
vitamin C was critical if you guys

411
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:33,279
wanted know this is the vimer the micro

412
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:36,240
C now you probably heard of the micro C

413
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:38,040
at this point I I think it's famous at

414
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,880
this point for what it does for people

415
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:45,000
and how it helps people so that's the

416
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:47,800
micro so micro is a lot more known than

417
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,800
I am a medical medium that's how many

418
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:51,720
people are using it to get their lives

419
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,199
back recover and do things for

420
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,880
themselves you know so it's really an

421
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:58,000
incredible product right here so that's

422
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:59,600
the micro C it's the vimergy one right

423
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,440
so let's go into the Skin Potion a

424
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,959
little bit more people are are really

425
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,760
focused on their skin more than ever

426
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:07,799
because of social media because

427
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:10,000
everybody wants to look good for social

428
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:12,360
media not everybody but a lot of people

429
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,439
are jumping onto the social media

430
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:16,919
bandwagon and they want their skin to

431
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:19,520
look good they just do that's what

432
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:21,520
everybody wants to do they're also

433
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,120
photoshopping all their photographs so

434
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,520
everybody's doing the photoshopping on

435
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,400
photographs because of their skin

436
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,799
they're trying to photoshop every single

437
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,400
thing that shouldn't be on their face

438
00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:32,679
they're trying to photoshop it out right

439
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:35,520
now it's all about skin and it's getting

440
00:17:32,679 --> 00:17:38,600
even crazier but in order to get your

441
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:41,520
skin better you have to fix problems you

442
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:44,960
have to fix internal issues immune

443
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:47,720
system is a big one right there and then

444
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:50,679
free radical damage so you guys have

445
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:53,320
heard of free radical damage right

446
00:17:50,679 --> 00:17:55,159
because free radical damage that's a

447
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:56,799
common term that's not a medical medium

448
00:17:55,159 --> 00:17:59,919
term that's not MediCal medium

449
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:01,360
information free radical damage it's not

450
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:04,480
but there's something to be said about

451
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:05,799
it there really is medical medium talks

452
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,520
about what free

453
00:18:05,799 --> 00:18:10,000
radicals what free radicals are which

454
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,919
free radicals are the problems that

455
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,080
nobody talked about so medical me

456
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:15,600
information is about so many different

457
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,240
things right like pesticides and the

458
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,000
herbicides and the fungicides and all

459
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:21,200
the difference of the fragrances the

460
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,480
Clones of perfumes all the different air

461
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,840
fresheners it was medical medum

462
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,520
information originally being put out

463
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,039
there for decades until finally it got

464
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:29,360
caught on and now it's all over the

465
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:31,159
place but mm INF

466
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,760
was all about what kind of free radicals

467
00:18:31,159 --> 00:18:34,520
are we talking about and then the free

468
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:36,200
radicals produced in our body that's

469
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:39,200
originally where the term free radicals

470
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:41,120
came from free radical terminology was

471
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:44,200
all about free radicals produced inside

472
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:46,280
your body you guys causing problems

473
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,799
oxidative

474
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:50,400
stress

475
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:53,240
but what happens is if you don't fix

476
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:55,720
internal issues like fix the immune

477
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:58,280
system strengthen it help clean up the

478
00:18:55,720 --> 00:19:00,200
liver a little bit get some problem

479
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:02,240
solved get the immune system functioning

480
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:05,000
like it needs to function if you don't

481
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,679
do that you can't fix a lot inside your

482
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,159
body you can't fix a lot of things

483
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:10,880
inside your body it's not going to

484
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:13,679
happen if you're somebody focused on

485
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:16,039
skin especially you're not going to

486
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:18,600
repair scar dish scar tissue damage

487
00:19:16,039 --> 00:19:20,360
you're not going to repair acne damage

488
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:22,840
you're not going to repair

489
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:24,360
things if you can't take care of your

490
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,200
immune system and your Skin's immune

491
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:29,039
system it's not going to

492
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:32,039
happen so in order to repair skin and

493
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:34,559
get it healthy and get it looking

494
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:37,280
good and one thing happened where when

495
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:39,520
we were at the Cafe Gratitude right if

496
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:41,840
you guys were there it was amazing to to

497
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:44,960
meet you and see you a few people are

498
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:46,679
like aw your skin does look good it's

499
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:50,520
not I'm in person right in front of you

500
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:53,240
and it does look good um zarz over here

501
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:55,039
on YouTube aw skin looks even better in

502
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:56,840
person and it looks pretty good on the

503
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:59,799
video too it looks pretty good on the

504
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:02,400
video but you saw me in person you were

505
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:05,080
a foot I think zarz you were a foot away

506
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:07,000
from me I think everybody was a foot

507
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:09,159
some people were this close to

508
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,559
me I think a couple of people were

509
00:20:09,159 --> 00:20:14,520
talking to me and spit flung out of

510
00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:16,200
their mouth and landed on my lip and on

511
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:19,200
my mouth and on my nose what I'm saying

512
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:21,440
we were this close we were this

513
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,919
close

514
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:27,880
right and anyway the point I'm trying to

515
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:29,240
say is that um I'm not 20 years old I

516
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:32,440
don't get exfoli

517
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:37,320
ations I didn't get plastic

518
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:40,480
surgery um and I don't get facials in

519
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:43,600
fact I do probably real annoying

520
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:45,559
things like not wash my face for a long

521
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:48,840
time because I'm too busy working and

522
00:20:45,559 --> 00:20:52,520
not focused on on personal

523
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:56,120
hygiene so I do a lot of things that are

524
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:59,880
not pro skin at

525
00:20:56,120 --> 00:21:01,799
all but there's something I do do

526
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:04,520
and that's the whole point it's the

527
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:07,520
antioxidant factor it's the

528
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:10,240
antioxidant factor it's

529
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:12,159
that it's so many different foods with

530
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,799
the higher

531
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:17,039
antioxidants it's that too it's all

532
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:19,240
these things and things like the micro

533
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:21,279
SE so the micro is how I make the

534
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:23,000
medical medium Skin Potion I'll show you

535
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:25,320

00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:29,520

different aspects of skin health

538
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:37,400

540
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:42,559

541
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:45,200
the thing like this has gotten popular

542
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:48,720
now the micro C because it works it's

543
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:52,159

along with the MSM so it's the

546
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:58,360
combination right here so when you put

547
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,840
them together it takes it to the next

548
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:02,640
level level which is really amazing and

you on YouTube thank you for being here

00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:23,480
thank you for sharing that I think one

557
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:28,159
of the hardships about skin issues you

558
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:30,120
guys is feeling that you feel insecure

559
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:31,960
you don't don't feel good about yourself

560
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:34,080
and if you have a skin condition I never

561
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:36,760
want you to feel that way ever I don't

562
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:38,880
want you to feel like you're not good

563
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:40,559
enough or you can't be in person

564
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,720
somewhere or you can't say hi to

565
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:45,520
somebody or you can't talk to somebody I

566
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:49,000
never want you to feel that way if you

567
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:51,240
do have a skin issue because it that

568
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,400
that's not about that but so many people

569
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:56,559
are suffering with how they feel when

570
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:59,159
their skin doesn't look a certain way or

571
00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:01,159
they have acne or they have a scar a lot

572
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:03,440
of people have scars and the scars

573
00:23:01,159 --> 00:23:06,240
aren't healing and they don't know why

574
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:09,159
so they get facial scars from acne and

575
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:12,320
other things from white heads and black

576
00:23:09,159 --> 00:23:14,559
heads and different stuff and rosacea

577
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:17,520
over time rosacea can create the

578
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:20,960
scarring that occurs on your face in

579
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:22,360
your skin tissue and so like the rosacea

580
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:25,039
so if you're somebody you have 20 years

581
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:27,200
of rosacea or 5 years of rosacea you

582
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:28,720
could you can have like problems and

583
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,840
then you're wondering well what I going

584
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,840
to do how come this isn't

585
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:37,720
healing in order to heal like deep

586
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:40,480
seeded skin problems you have to have

587
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:43,240
the high intense

588
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:46,880
antioxidants you have to have the free

589
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:50,400
radical damage killer and

590
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:52,200
destroyers you have to have that vitamin

591
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,640
C you have to have that so there's

592
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,159
different antioxidants and there's

593
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,720
different antioxidants in Foods I've

594
00:23:55,159 --> 00:24:00,159
talked about this all the

595
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:03,039
time but like moving the needle fast is

596
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:05,600
what matters in in a lot of ways like

597
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:08,480
you can't if you can't get a skin

598
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:11,640
problem better fast enough it could

599
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:13,240
really affect you emotionally mentally a

600
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:14,640
lot of people they need to get

601
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:16,400
themselves ready for something it could

602
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,880
be somebody's wedding it could be it

603
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,400
could be something else it could be

604
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:22,600
meeting somebody going on a date if

605
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,159
people they change their dates they

606
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:26,159
change the you know times you're going

607
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:27,600
to meet people they do all kinds of

608
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:30,279
different stuff they don't go to friends

609
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:32,840
weddings because to their skin and it's

610
00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:34,760
really sad it's really sad and then they

611
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:38,840
end up using a lot of toxic things which

612
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:42,760
I want to say next the skin world of

613
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:44,919
health is mostly made of toxic crap

614
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:48,960
toxic crap people are using on their

615
00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:51,559
skin or taking skin tonics so so to

616
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:53,840
speak you know taking skin supplements

617
00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:55,960
that have garbage in them hair skin and

618
00:24:53,840 --> 00:25:00,640
nail supplements are some of the

619
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:03,200
trashiest crap out there on the

620
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:05,880
market

621
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:09,360
fact

622
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:11,399
maltodextrin magnesium

623
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:13,480
sterate citric

624
00:25:11,399 --> 00:25:16,960
acid natural

625
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:20,559
flavors whatever just loads of junk and

626
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:22,279
garbage and not not only that other

627
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:25,159
things you can't see that are not on the

628
00:25:22,279 --> 00:25:26,960
ingredient list so what people are doing

629
00:25:25,159 --> 00:25:29,760
for their skin out there is are using

630
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:33,159
toxic stuff that's added to their free

631
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:34,760
radical bump up they think they're doing

632
00:25:33,159 --> 00:25:36,880
something for their hair skin and nails

633
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:39,600
and they're taking all the you'll see it

634
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:41,440
out there there'll be another 500 new

635
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,960
companies putting out a hair skin and

636
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:47,240
nail supplement because everybody's

637
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:49,480
desperate right now to get their skin

638
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:51,200
better but they're taking all this

639
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:52,760
additional crap from those supplements

640
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,399
in their body that's bogging down their

641
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,600
liver that's not helping them that's

642
00:25:54,399 --> 00:25:58,520
setting them

643
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,880
back and that's a big problem here you

644
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:01,480
are trying to fix a problem you're

645
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:03,159
trying to fix your skin but you can't

646
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:04,960
fix your skin because you're adding to

647
00:26:03,159 --> 00:26:08,080
the problem but you're yet you're paying

648
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:09,880
all this money constantly each month to

649
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:12,000
help with your problem but you're not

650
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:14,000
you're doing the reverse you're actually

651
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,279
adding to the problem and not recovering

652
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,279
your

653
00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:22,440
skin I'm not saying every single skin

654
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:25,960
problem somebody has on their body or

655
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:28,600
their face is healable some people have

656
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:30,279
some really deep seated scars those SCS

657
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:32,120
are going to be there they've been cut

658
00:26:30,279 --> 00:26:34,720
they've had 10 stitches they've had five

659
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:36,159
stitches they've had 50 stitches there

660
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,840
are people out there with a lot of

661
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:40,480
injuries and skin injuries they have

662
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:42,880
really bad Burns that went through the

663
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:45,520
Derma there's people out there that have

664
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:48,360
been burned on their skin where the

665
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:50,200
where the hot part that burned them

666
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:52,840
whatever that might have been went

667
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:55,600
through their layers of skin down to the

668
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:57,080
bottom of the Derma into the flesh so

669
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,880
then they have a

670
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:02,440
scar well but what I am saying is if you

671
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:04,720
want that to repair on any level or have

672
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:07,720
even a hope that it can repair you got

673
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,720
to be doing things

674
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:14,919
right so there's a lot of different

675
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:17,840
Trends and a lot of different

676
00:27:14,919 --> 00:27:21,360
um different bio hacks for skin these

677
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:24,880
days and every time I see a new one I

678
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:26,799
instantly know that's not going to help

679
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:29,240
if anything that's going to add to the

680
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:31,080
problem if there is something that comes

681
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:33,559
out that's really good for the skin I'll

682
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:36,960
be the first to jump on it why

683
00:27:33,559 --> 00:27:38,640
not I want to I want to do things too

684
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,960
that are

685
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,640
healthy but there isn't and that's the

686
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:46,039
problem so over here on IG are we

687
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:48,200

688
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:49,720
our skin sorry for the question silly

689
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,600
question it's not a silly question it's

690
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:53,360
it's an important question you're going

691
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,919
to take this internally is what you're

692
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,640
going to do and ask your doctor what's

693
00:27:54,919 --> 00:27:59,919
right for you you know ask them what

694
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:01,440

Tok all

707
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:34,640
right there's a miracle that occurred

708
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:35,880
with vimergy a miracle I call it a

709
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,120
miracle because it hasn't occurred

710
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:40,559
anywhere

711
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:44,360
else not that I know

712
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:46,880
of that Miracle is there isn't an anti-t

713
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:50,200
taking agent made out of something

714
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:53,960
sinister that you don't know that you're

715
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:58,880
taking there's no anti-caking

716
00:28:53,960 --> 00:29:01,480
agent in this micro SE powder but guess

717
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:03,200
what in all your green powders and all

718
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:05,240
your powders I see a green powder when

719
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,440
you know I was over my family's house

720
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:08,960
the other day they had the TV on and it

721
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,559
was a popular green powder that's been

722
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,799
taking off they got like millions and

723
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:14,840
millions of dollars running in ads and

724
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:16,679
everything and it was loaded with

725
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:18,039
anti-caking agents inside of it but

726
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:20,000
nobody

727
00:29:18,039 --> 00:29:23,360
knew it's a

728
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:26,360
Sinister kind of a diabolical

729
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:29,720
despicable world the health movement

730
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:31,399
it's grown pretty tumorous

731
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:33,679
it really

732
00:29:31,399 --> 00:29:36,320
has I think what people need to

733
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:39,080
understand is like Purity it really does

734
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:41,080
exist just nobody knows what's really

735
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:43,200
happening and who's doing it so what

736
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:44,960
you're seeing right here with this is

737
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:48,960
there's

738
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:50,880
no anti-caking agents in there but

739
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,320
you'll have it in all your powders and

740
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:54,200
all your protein powders and all the

741
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:56,880
different patterns you take and do it's

742
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:58,919
all there it's in there that means

743
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:02,159
there's a portion at add it to it to

744
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:04,519
stop it from sticking just

745
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:06,519
because just

746
00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:08,320
because that's one thing right there

747
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:09,559
that I call a miracle because vimergy

748
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:12,360
wouldn't do that that's why I endorse

749
00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:15,159
them that's why I I dedicate time and

750
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:16,640
energy I do I don't own the company I

751
00:30:15,159 --> 00:30:18,640
don't own a percentage of the company I

752
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:20,600
don't have stocks and shares I don't

753
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:23,320
have anything I don't have an interest I

754
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:25,720
don't have a stake in the

755
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:29,440
company I'm telling you and you have to

756
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:31,960
know that this right here is that pure

757
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:33,279
and that's why I love it so there's no

758
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:36,399
anti-caking

759
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:38,880
agents in here like there is everywhere

760
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:40,360
else and what those are made out of

761
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:45,600
usually is

762
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:47,760
corn it's usually made out of corn

763
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:50,039
powder that's what it's usually made out

764
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:53,159
of and if it's not corn powder it's

765
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:56,760
other things

766
00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:59,639
so like I said I don't own vimergy and I

767
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:01,760
don't have any stake percentage of the

768
00:30:59,639 --> 00:31:04,440
company and so forth but I endorse them

769
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:06,240
I do and I stand behind them so I'm

770
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:08,080
going to make this Skin Potion but we're

771
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:12,480
covering like details about skin and how

772
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:12,480
it works so I want to show you something

773
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,880
here one way you can keep your skin

774
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:21,840
healthy is your lymphatic system but

775
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:25,360
constantly doing lymphatic massage and

776
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:26,200
lymphatic drainage is just a Band-Aid

777
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,279
just a

778
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:31,440
Band-Aid now if you have if you're

779
00:31:28,279 --> 00:31:33,840
somebody and you have $150 three times a

780
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:37,039
week so that's what $300

781
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:39,519
$450 a week and you're maybe you're

782
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:41,360
somebody maybe you're um an influencer a

783
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:42,799
social media influencer and you did good

784
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,360
or whatever it is and you can go and get

785
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:45,480
your lymphatic drainage three times a

786
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:48,240
week maybe you're somebody that's really

787
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:51,200
wealthy and you can spend $500 $700 on

788
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:53,600
lymphatic drainage go ahead but you're

789
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:56,240
doing a Band-Aid is what you're doing so

790
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:59,519
your lymphatic system is involved in

791
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:02,399
skin okay

792
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:04,799
it is your lymphatic system holds a lot

793
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:06,919
of trash and garbage and free radicals

794
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:10,080
and junk and all of that in there but if

795
00:32:06,919 --> 00:32:12,279
you can't keep your lymphatic systems

796
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:14,120
immune system strong you're not going to

797
00:32:12,279 --> 00:32:16,519
have a good chance of cleaning out that

798
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:19,559
lymphatic system and keeping it clean if

799
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:21,240
you don't take care of your liver and

800
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:23,679
keep that cleaner you can't keep your

801
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:26,200
lymphatic system cleaner

802
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:29,840
either what I love for the lymphatic

803
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:33,399
system is I love vitamin c not ascorbic

804
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:38,200
acid though vitamin C so the vimer right

805
00:32:33,399 --> 00:32:41,519
there micro C isn't ascorbic

806
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:45,600
acid it's buffered and it's not ascorbic

807
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:49,360
acid scorc acid does not do the job and

808
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:52,440
taking a lot of it is not easy to do you

809
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:55,559
end up burning up your intestinal lining

810
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:58,000
your stomach your dadum and so forth and

811
00:32:55,559 --> 00:33:00,440
that's something also that I find is a

812
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:03,279
Miracle with the

813
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:05,159
micro so skin problems let's head and

814
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:08,080
talk a little bit more about skin issues

815
00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:12,159
and so forth our body tends to push

816
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:14,600
toxins out through the skin you guys

817
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:18,679
that's what our body tends to do push

818
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:20,840
toxins out through the skin one reason

819
00:33:18,679 --> 00:33:23,720
why our body pushes toxins out through

820
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:26,120
the skin so much is because everybody's

821
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:28,960
liver yes everybody's liver is

822
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:31,320

all the stuff we breathe in all the

829
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:45,760

830
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:48,960
pathogens included and everything else

831
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:51,399

00:33:51,399 --> 00:33:54,480
stuff gets in the liver and stays in the

834
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:56,919
liver for an entire lifetime for

835
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:59,039
somebody when that liver gets clogged up

836
00:33:56,919 --> 00:34:01,480
you're going to be p pushing toxins out

837
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:03,159
through your skin the problem with

838
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:05,159
pushing toxins out through your skin and

839
00:34:03,159 --> 00:34:06,639
this is medical Med information right

840
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:08,960
here

841
00:34:06,639 --> 00:34:12,040
too is that when you're getting all that

842
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:13,639
sun your that sun is hitting your skin

843
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:16,839
and it's hitting the

844
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:18,520
toxins it's kind of cooking the toxins

845
00:34:16,839 --> 00:34:20,679
when you get your and that's not a good

846
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:22,399
thing I'm not saying don't get sun get

847
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:24,119
sun but what I'm saying is we have to

848
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:26,720
clean up our bodies a little bit we have

849
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:29,159
to clean up our livers we have to clean

850
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:31,240
up our lymphatic systems through

851
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:34,280
cleaning up our livers we have to clean

852
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:37,839
up our bloodstream we don't want dirty

853
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:40,159
bloodstream we don't want dirty blood

854
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:42,119
syndrome and people walk around with

855
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:46,040
dirty blood

856
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:48,119
syndrome so our skin gets all this crud

857
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:50,079
in it because we have crud inside the

858
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:52,760
body and it's all coming up through our

859
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:55,440
skin the cleaner you are internally the

860
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:58,560
cleaner your skin gets do you guys hear

861
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:01,200
that internally the cleaner you are the

862
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:03,359
cleaner your skin gets less stuff comes

863
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:05,520

everywhere all of it that gets taken

867
00:35:10,359 --> 00:35:13,520
down a notch the cleaner you are if

868
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:15,760
you're somebody and you're not going to

869
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:18,839
be able to clean the internal system up

870
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:20,359
that's okay you can use intense

871
00:35:18,839 --> 00:35:23,440
antioxidant

872
00:35:20,359 --> 00:35:25,760
therapy which is something like a really

873
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:28,680

science was right about free radicals

886
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:57,960
the concept they didn't really know what

887
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:59,880

891
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,880
get radiation exposure every single day

892
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:12,040
and don't even know it they're getting

893
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:14,079

894
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:15,800
their skin too it's giving them mild

themselves and what happens is when they

00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:16,119
have skin issues it can be devastating

967
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,880
for a lot of people really devastating

968
00:39:16,119 --> 00:39:19,119
now people do get used to it after a

969
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:20,599
while and they're just like well that's

970
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:22,119
just the cards I've been dealt with but

971
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:23,160
it doesn't have to be the cards you were

972
00:39:22,119 --> 00:39:25,599
dealt

973
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:27,400
with you know I mean I understand that

974
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:28,640
phrase and that saying it's just it's

975
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:30,280
the cards I've been dealt with but you

976
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:33,760
know it doesn't have to be that way when

977
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:37,560
it comes down to her skin Ashley over

978
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:41,520

983
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:56,440
compliment and I want people to know out

many moving Parts there's so many things

993
00:40:17,079 --> 00:40:22,839

00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:39,920
here and be like an infomercial for skin

1000
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:41,960
I can't I can't do it so I can only once

1001
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:43,920
in a while and this might be the the

1002
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:46,280
last time I do this with the Skin Potion

1003
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:48,200
for who knows how long I just but would

1004
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:50,280
I love to be teaching people would I

1005
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:52,480

00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:57,880
people and with their skin I would love

1008
00:40:55,640 --> 00:41:00,359
love love to do that if if you know

1009
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:02,079
somebody spread this information so I I

1010
00:41:00,359 --> 00:41:05,319
don't have to work as

1011
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:07,359
hard spread the information so I can I

1012
00:41:05,319 --> 00:41:10,359
can keep going and working on some other

1013
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:12,160
things but tell somebody about the

1014
00:41:10,359 --> 00:41:13,839
medical medium Skin Potion so they can

1015
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:16,240
get their skin in a better place tell

1016
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:18,160
somebody's friends tell somebody so they

1017
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:20,319
can get their skin in a better place if

1018
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:23,119
you think that's something they want or

1019
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:24,880
you think that's something they need but

1020
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:27,040
yeah so let's make the Skin Potion right

1021
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:28,920
here but the stuff that's out there in

1022
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,680
the crap that's out there is disturbing

1023
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:32,880
I think the collagen thing has been

1024
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:35,440
really a total let down is all the

1025
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:37,480
collagen BS about taking collagen and

1026
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:39,200
your skin getting better it's ridiculous

1027
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:41,119
I actually looked at an influenc

1028
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:43,800
recently that somebody brought that

1029
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:46,400
brought uh my attention to and it was

1030
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:47,520
like 12 years ago like 10 years ago or

1031
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,359
something they were doing this whole

1032
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:51,920
collagen thing and selling this collagen

1033
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:55,760
right and they were 10 years younger

1034
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:57,240
they look like crap right now I saw them

1035
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,960
if that's what their college in

1036
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:02,599
supplement did for them in the last 10

1037
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:05,800
years oh my God I'm not going to say any

1038
00:42:02,599 --> 00:42:09,800
names right here but they looked

1039
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:12,079
awful like their skin was torn apart

1040
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:14,440
like it was terrible and I'm like that's

1041
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:16,599
10 years of collegen supplements and not

1042
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:19,079
knowing what heals skin and not know not

1043
00:42:16,599 --> 00:42:20,520
knowing what works it's just sad to see

1044
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:22,880
all this stuff like I said I can't sit

1045
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:25,240
here every day and try to try to message

1046
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:27,880
about skin I can't do that Mary over

1047
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:30,000
there on IG

1048
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:32,599
I started it every day one year ago

1049
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:35,200
today and replaced coffee with it I had

1050
00:42:32,599 --> 00:42:38,559
a lesion on my leg that was going to get

1051
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:41,640
taken off whoa and it disappeared

1052
00:42:38,559 --> 00:42:46,440
completely in about a

1053
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:46,440
month whoa that's incredible
