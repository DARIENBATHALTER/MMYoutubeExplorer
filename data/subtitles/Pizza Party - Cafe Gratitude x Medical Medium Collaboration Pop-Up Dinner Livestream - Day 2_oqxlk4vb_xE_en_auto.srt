also be surrounded by people that

105
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:45,840
support your healing Journey absolutely

106
00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:48,800
because again in in our world that we

107
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:52,639
live and everybody has a right to their

108
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:55,919
own choices of what their journey is but

109
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:57,840
we are very special community and our

110
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,680
journey is different than others and

111
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,280
we're choosing a different path and so

112
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,440
sometimes when you choose a different

113
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,400
path than everybody else it's a little

114
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,879
bit harder you get a little push back

115
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:09,919
yes yes that's true what is one piece of

116
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:11,720
information from medical medium that

117
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:14,159
stands out to you that really helped you

118
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:17,080
with your healing Journey well you know

119
00:08:14,159 --> 00:08:19,720
I honestly do the lemon water and then I

120
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:23,319
do the celery juice and this is

121
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:25,639
difficult is not having fat before noon

122
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:29,599
pretty much so you're like okay what do

123
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:32,080
I eat but I think it makes a huge

124
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:34,560
difference to be able to cleanse your

125
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:37,599
liver and give it time to cleanse

126
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:40,159
because your body is meant to heal food

127
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:43,200
is medicine though some don't believe

128
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:45,519
that and I love the medicine that he

129
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,839
imparts to all of us yes do you have any

130
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,040
encouraging message you would like to

131
00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:51,399
share with those who are going through

132
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:54,240
their healing Journey you know it's one

133
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:57,640
step at a time one day at a time and I

134
00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:00,040
believe in manifestation if you believe

135
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:01,760
I believe as my father May he rest in

136
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:04,360

137
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:06,760

discover the medical medium information

253
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:12,440
well it's a long story but essentially

254
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,120
I'm a nurse 40 years I had been a nurse

255
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:15,680
and I had gotten very sick and of course

256
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:18,639
went the whole medical route trying to

257
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:21,199
get well um I got covid I ended up in

258
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:22,880
bed and I just knew I could fix this and

259
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:25,279
they kept saying I couldn't and I kept

260
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:28,000
putting me on more pills and I was not

261
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:30,120
buying it I just knew food was medicine

262
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,160
and somehow I found this Epstein bar

263
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:34,440
which I knew my tighters were high and

264
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,839
there he was I Googled it and found

265
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:38,519
medical medium uh bought bought every

266
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:42,880
book I have all of them except for the

267
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:45,560
brain Sabers but um took a couple years

268
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:47,160
uh so how did you how did you first

269
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:49,040
start that healing Journey what did you

270
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:50,800
start with was it the celery juice the

271
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:53,399
detox smoothie I started right in all

272
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:55,920
the way celery juice detox smoothie I

273
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:58,519
eliminated all the fats um it took a

274
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:00,680
while for some some fats like nuts and

275
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:04,199
stuff to leave leave my diet but it it

276
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:07,320
was a process and it all was it's but it

277
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:09,880
took a good year before I started me

278
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:12,240
things started to get better but I also

279
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:13,880
got really sick too while I was detoxing

280
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,920
because I was pretty sick that's

281
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:17,480
interesting because some people say it

282
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,480
happens you know they'll feel it within

283
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:21,399
a week and that's great for you to share

284
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,880
that it took time for you for people who

285
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:24,920
are on their healing journey and trying

286
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:27,000
this stick with it right yes no I got

287
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:30,199
sicker before I got better for sure I

288
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,720
was swollen I couldn't walk uh yeah it

289
00:15:30,199 --> 00:15:33,519
was hard and it was really hard to get

290
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:35,959
up and do it and do that celery juice

291
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:38,240
and do those do those protocols but I

292
00:15:35,959 --> 00:15:40,600
believed in that food was medicine yeah

293
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,959
food was medicine and proof is I'm here

294
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:44,880

295
00:15:41,959 --> 00:15:47,519

like it and being a nurse a critical

337
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:17,240
care nurse for 40 years you know I

338
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,319
always took care of myself because I

339
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:21,600
never wanted to be one of those people

340
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:23,720
and I was one of those people I was so

341
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,199
sick and I I didn't understand what had

342
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:27,280
happened and then to have doctors just

343
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:29,240

346
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,559

347
00:17:33,559 --> 00:17:39,880

348
00:17:35,559 --> 00:17:41,799

351
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:48,480

information how did you come across it

and how long have you been using it for

431
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:50,280
um I discovered it 6 years ago um I was

432
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:51,960
really sick um I knew I needed answers I

433
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:54,159
was trying a lot of different natural

434
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:55,799
remedies but nothing was really working

435
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:57,120
but I had a lot of faith that there was

436
00:20:55,799 --> 00:20:59,880
something out there that would help me

437
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:02,000
heal and um I really feel like I was

438
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:04,600
guided spiritually to this information

439
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,600
and um when I read the first book I it

440
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:08,760
just clicked I knew that it was what I

441
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:11,360
had been praying for and hoping for so

442
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:12,480
yeah wow did you have uh experienc

443
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:15,240
health benefits from using the

444
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:17,440
information oh yeah definitely I was um

445
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:19,760
I was in college um and like falling

446
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:22,240
asleep and like I couldn't stay awake I

447
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:25,400

448
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:27,760
fatigue and um gut health issues and

449
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:29,919
I've been able to heal all of that um in

450
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:31,679
the six years that I've been following I

451
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:33,400

amazing and that's incredible what's one

455
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:41,679
of your favorite things about the

456
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:45,080
medical medium information um that it

457
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:47,400
comes from above uh that it's grounded

458
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:50,840
spirituality um that it's you know the

459
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:53,559
physical and the spiritual um and I love

the nature meditations but yeah just

461
00:21:53,559 --> 00:21:57,720
that it's both spiritual and physical a

462

lot of people talk about their healing

463
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:01,240

the morning and saying that you work for

470
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:18,799

543
00:24:58,399 --> 00:25:03,520
mastering diabetes and at that time I

544
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:07,200
was vegan and I thought you know hm

545
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:10,360
medium I didn't really I wasn't sure uh

546
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:12,720
but I uh tuned into hey house radio and

547
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:15,799
I started listening to his podcast his

548
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:17,960
radio shows and so I started learning

549
00:25:15,799 --> 00:25:19,760
and I enjoyed it I started kind of

550
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:21,760
picking few things off of his

551
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,960
information hoping I could get that

552
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:26,880
phone call with him I called every

553
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:30,720
Monday but I wasn't uh lucky enough but

554
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:32,159
I also signed up at his page for the um

555
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,320
um

556
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:36,840
practitioners on his website back then

557
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:39,520
in 2015 16 on his website there was a

558
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:41,919
link for practitioners uh but I know the

559
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:44,440
line is long so I'm still hoping to get

560
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:47,600
that if he's still doing it uh to be

561
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:51,399
able to learn how I can um improve my

562
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:52,799
skills to help my clients so and what

563
00:25:51,399 --> 00:25:55,039
are some of the symptoms and conditions

564
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:57,480
you've healed using medical medium

565
00:25:55,039 --> 00:26:00,000
information a lot of neurological

566
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:02,159
conditions and uh right now I'm still

567
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,360
working on fragrance sensitivity and

568
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:07,320
chemical sensitivity because once the

569
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:10,159
bug came to town I was so compromised I

570
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:11,760
lost sense of smell and I was getting so

571
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:13,679
sick but I didn't know what was causing

572
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:15,520
it until about 8 months later when my

573
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:18,120
smell came back and I realized every

574
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:19,880
time I smell perfume cologne every time

575
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:22,440
I got exposed to any kind of a bleach

576
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:24,440
smell ammonia smell I was being so

577
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:26,960
compromised I would cancel the work next

578
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:29,799
day because I was just sleeping I was

579
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:32,840
nauseated I was tired would get bloated

580
00:26:29,799 --> 00:26:34,919
and so I started uh doing a lot of

581
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:36,679
advanced heavy metal detox movie and a

582
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:40,760
lot of advanced extractors movie which

583
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:42,840
helps greatly I'm still not 100% healed

584
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:45,760
from it but I can walk into a shoe store

585
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:49,360
without wearing a VCC respirator so

586
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:52,080
that's a big step and just last night um

587
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:54,720
when I went back to my hotel room I was

588
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:59,240
going to sleep and I realized the Linens

589
00:26:54,720 --> 00:27:01,640
were heavily um smelling as a bleach so

590
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:03,480
I thought this is not good but I didn't

591
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:05,760
know how bad it was until the morning

592
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:09,720
when I woke up with my face swollen

593
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:11,960
buffed eyes um runny nose I was tearing

594
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:15,360
just one side of one one of my eyes were

595
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:17,399
just constantly tearing and um I came

596
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:19,360
here to Cafe Gratitude and first thing I

597
00:27:17,399 --> 00:27:21,039
asked them please tell me if you have a

598
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:23,200
hibiscus tea because that's what Anthony

599
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:27,000
recommends a hibiscus rose hips

600
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:28,720
raspberries and uh also uh blackberry

601
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,880
leaves for

602
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:33,760
bleach exposure um and so they served me

603
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:36,000
a hibiscus tea I drink that and I now

604
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:38,159
got the reset and I had a reset

605
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,360
throughout the day and I made more

606
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:43,600
hibiscus tea just before I showed up

607
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:46,159
here have my immune uh support

608
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:48,320
supplement and I'm feeling much better

609
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:50,440
so I know his information works and it

610
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,760
works quickly because in the morning I

611
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:53,840

612
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:55,399

1389
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:19,160
was younger I was like 16 17 years old I

1390
01:05:16,839 --> 01:05:21,000
think I fell down with the bike and I

1391
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:24,599
damaged my front thee so I have crowns

1392
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:26,240
here okay but back then they put uh yeah

1393
01:05:24,599 --> 01:05:27,680
metals on the back they put yeah they

1394
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:30,359
put different things I'm scratching

1395
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:33,200
while I buite every time and I'm

1396
01:05:30,359 --> 01:05:35,520
wondering if I I heal a lot like 90% I

1397
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:38,359

1398
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:40,400
you finding a good a good um Dental

1399
01:05:38,359 --> 01:05:41,920
person all that that's right but some

1400
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:43,400
people say like yeah leave it leave it

1401
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:47,119
because the glue from back then is

1402
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:50,319
really tough to get loose to loosen up

1403
01:05:47,119 --> 01:05:51,440
um I saw your podcast with the dentist

1404
01:05:50,319 --> 01:05:54,920

them um they said they take a look um

1406
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:57,920
since I'm from Europe they said like

1407
01:05:56,240 --> 01:06:01,279
it's too far away so we should find

1408
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:03,599
someone more close by I understand I

1409
01:06:01,279 --> 01:06:05,319

1410
01:06:03,599 --> 01:06:07,680

I won't be able to answer that one

1445
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:39,640
because there's so much there's so many

1446
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:41,920
things involved you know um do you have

1447
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:43,480
a good person you talk to do you doing

1448
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:44,880
different seeing different people to

1449
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:47,359
give you different opinions just

1450
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:49,039
considering it I'm considering I'm doing

1451
01:07:47,359 --> 01:07:50,799
all the information implementing

1452
01:07:49,039 --> 01:07:52,359
everything but I wonder you find a

1453
01:07:50,799 --> 01:07:54,960
practitioner that understands the

1454
01:07:52,359 --> 01:07:56,839
information you find a doctor that

1455
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:59,640
understands I would just keep on looking

1456
01:07:56,839 --> 01:08:02,079
find the right person and and and then

1457
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:04,720
you know have that that communication

1458
01:08:02,079 --> 01:08:06,559
with them for a decision like that all

1459
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:09,079

many heartaches

01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:33,560
things are occurring in their lives they

1742
01:21:30,199 --> 01:21:36,040
feel something must be behind this it's

1743
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:38,360
important to understand the realm that's

1744
01:21:36,040 --> 01:21:41,280
very rarely seen by the

1745
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:45,000
eyes in all these decades I've been

1746
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:48,639
asked about angels asked about the

1747
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:52,120
afterlife I've been asked about

1748
01:21:48,639 --> 01:21:56,040
demons to understand demonic forces is

1749
01:21:52,120 --> 01:21:58,760

1750
01:21:56,040 --> 01:22:01,360

01:22:01,360 --> 01:22:08,080
forces at work in our lives you are

1753
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:11,320
going to be awakened and you're going to

1754
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:13,440
understand how to regain your power to

1755
01:22:11,320 --> 01:22:17,520
help protect yourself and your loved

1756
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:20,320
ones so we can play our part in stopping

1757
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:22,640
demonic forces in their tracks like

1758
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:26,609

don't manifest our illnesses or like

01:36:22,480 --> 01:36:26,280
issues and stuff correct I think I think

2065
01:36:24,840 --> 01:36:28,560
the way you're saying it yes that's

2066
01:36:26,280 --> 01:36:31,040
that's correct so how much of it is like

2067
01:36:28,560 --> 01:36:33,840
a matrix attack how much his past lives

2068
01:36:31,040 --> 01:36:35,639
or Karma we're releasing and like is a

2069
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:37,480
lot of a lot of it Matrix attacks

2070
01:36:35,639 --> 01:36:40,560
because we're like really trying to

2071
01:36:37,480 --> 01:36:42,679

I mean I yeah you really

2078
01:36:54,280 --> 01:36:58,119
okay so you're not going to tell me well

2079
01:36:56,440 --> 01:37:01,080
no maybe I should talk about it more

2080
01:36:58,119 --> 01:37:03,280
though cuz it's such a big answer I mean

2081
01:37:01,080 --> 01:37:05,560
if I answer a piece of it it's going to

2082
01:37:03,280 --> 01:37:07,679
be missing 10 pieces right now that's

2083
01:37:05,560 --> 01:37:09,560
the only problem you know what I mean

2084
01:37:07,679 --> 01:37:11,400
yeah it's a huge question it's like the

2085
01:37:09,560 --> 01:37:13,320
meaning of life question it's like

2086
01:37:11,400 --> 01:37:15,440
what's the meaning of life that's how

2087
01:37:13,320 --> 01:37:17,119
big that question is so I I wouldn't

2088
01:37:15,440 --> 01:37:19,080
even be able to answer it all I'd leave

2089
01:37:17,119 --> 01:37:21,600
it I would leave it like I would leave

2090
01:37:19,080 --> 01:37:23,840
Parts out and then and then people would

2091
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:26,360
be like wait a minute this is doesn't

2092
01:37:23,840 --> 01:37:29,600

2186
01:41:18,199 --> 01:41:22,760
it I tried the mono cleans uh again was

2187
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:25,199

I lost some weight and uh it really

2189
01:41:25,199 --> 01:41:29,000
scared me are you getting enough you get

2190
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:31,400
enough calories I try to get as many

2191
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:34,040
calories as possible I don't want to

2192
01:41:31,400 --> 01:41:35,920
anyone else well that's the thing about

2193
01:41:34,040 --> 01:41:38,159
good thing but that's the thing about

2194
01:41:35,920 --> 01:41:39,199
hard for me yeah listen it's important

2195
01:41:38,159 --> 01:41:42,199
to know

2196
01:41:39,199 --> 01:41:44,960
like you can eat as much as you need to

2197
01:41:42,199 --> 01:41:46,719
eat there's no there's no portion thing

2198
01:41:44,960 --> 01:41:49,440
there's no nothing like you make sure

2199
01:41:46,719 --> 01:41:51,040
you're eating enough yeah because this

2200
01:41:49,440 --> 01:41:53,320
the medical meme information is the only

2201
01:41:51,040 --> 01:41:56,119
information that doesn't minimize

2202
01:41:53,320 --> 01:41:58,040
portions no no every single cleanse out

2203
01:41:56,119 --> 01:42:00,599
there in the world every single diet

2204
01:41:58,040 --> 01:42:02,320
belief system they they restrict and

2205
01:42:00,599 --> 01:42:04,040
they restrict and they restrict but

2206
01:42:02,320 --> 01:42:06,560
there's no restrictions so don't hold

2207
01:42:04,040 --> 01:42:08,800
back no I didn't build yourself up yeah

2208
01:42:06,560 --> 01:42:12,440

01:43:21,280 --> 01:43:26,440
a.m. in the morning and I was thinking

01:43:26,440 --> 01:43:29,840

2242
01:43:29,840 --> 01:43:32,920
Hollywood production and know what

2243
01:43:31,159 --> 01:43:36,000

ticket to come in but it's for it's for

2245

01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:43,000
it and I was thinking it's free how how

2247
01:43:41,159 --> 01:43:46,320
many people are working here and do do

2248
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:48,000
everything for for us and I know I know

02:18:38,160 --> 02:18:41,599
that got to get

3017
02:18:42,760 --> 02:18:50,040
myself hi Anthony to meet you again you

3018
02:18:47,439 --> 02:18:52,200
so I have a question have you ever heard

3019
02:18:50,040 --> 02:18:54,000
that women are capable of stopping and

3020
02:18:52,200 --> 02:18:57,319
controlling their reproductive

3021
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:59,160
system or stopping and controlling yeah

3022
02:18:57,319 --> 02:19:01,240
like to stop ovulating because we only

3023
02:18:59,160 --> 02:19:03,599
want to have like two kids per se and

3024
02:19:01,240 --> 02:19:07,639
then our immune system drops by like 80

3025
02:19:03,599 --> 02:19:09,479
to 90% so if we could stop ovulating

3026
02:19:07,639 --> 02:19:11,760
when we don't want to have kids that

3027
02:19:09,479 --> 02:19:16,040
could really save a woman's

3028
02:19:11,760 --> 02:19:20,359
life no I know and but but the but even

3029
02:19:16,040 --> 02:19:22,240
though um even though there's control or

3030
02:19:20,359 --> 02:19:24,319
control control can happen to that

3031
02:19:22,240 --> 02:19:28,280
degree then there's

3032
02:19:24,319 --> 02:19:30,760
God and then there's um you the Angelic

3033
02:19:28,280 --> 02:19:34,240
realm and there's things that happen for

3034
02:19:30,760 --> 02:19:37,240
reasons we just can't we we can't

3035
02:19:34,240 --> 02:19:40,800
measure and we can't understand and and

3036
02:19:37,240 --> 02:19:44,399
and sometimes it just you know overrides

3037
02:19:40,800 --> 02:19:46,120
a certain course and changes a direction

3038
02:19:44,399 --> 02:19:49,080
and so it

3039
02:19:46,120 --> 02:19:51,319
it you know nothing's guaranteed you

3040
02:19:49,080 --> 02:19:54,240
know and that's the one thing

3041
02:19:51,319 --> 02:19:57,160
about God and the Angelic realm and the

3042
02:19:54,240 --> 02:19:59,080
spiritual realm is things happen when we

3043
02:19:57,160 --> 02:20:01,040
don't even realize why they're happening

3044
02:19:59,080 --> 02:20:04,200
then or not and

3045
02:20:01,040 --> 02:20:07,600
so but I but I've heard I've heard of

3046
02:20:04,200 --> 02:20:10,120
something like in that that belief yeah

3047
02:20:07,600 --> 02:20:12,520
and um cuz when I read your book I

3048
02:20:10,120 --> 02:20:14,439
prayed for one thing menopause yep you

3049
02:20:12,520 --> 02:20:15,680
know and I was with a group of women

3050
02:20:14,439 --> 02:20:17,200
that we were all saying yeah when we

3051
02:20:15,680 --> 02:20:19,920
read his book we just prayed that we

3052
02:20:17,200 --> 02:20:21,359
would have that happen sooner than later

3053
02:20:19,920 --> 02:20:23,600
because our imun system is being

3054
02:20:21,359 --> 02:20:25,439
destroyed by our reproductive system

3055
02:20:23,600 --> 02:20:26,960
right so is God just angry at women and

3056
02:20:25,439 --> 02:20:30,399
we're not going to survive the viral a

3057
02:20:26,960 --> 02:20:32,000
[ __ ] this way no you know it it's it but

3058
02:20:30,399 --> 02:20:34,920
there's things though you know that's

3059
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:38,040
there's tools to over overcompensate

3060
02:20:34,920 --> 02:20:40,040
anything and and keep strong too so

3061
02:20:38,040 --> 02:20:42,080
there's a lot of tools as well you know

3062
02:20:40,040 --> 02:20:44,240

off mattress Island I started healing

3139
02:24:24,319 --> 02:24:32,160
with wild blueberry smoothies in 200

3140
02:24:27,880 --> 02:24:35,479
2006 and then uh she introduced me to

3141
02:24:32,160 --> 02:24:37,160
Hay House and then I found you in 2014

3142
02:24:35,479 --> 02:24:38,880
so I think the way I found the blueberry

3143
02:24:37,160 --> 02:24:41,880
smoothies must have been from somebody

3144
02:24:38,880 --> 02:24:43,760
who saw you lecture back in the day um

3145
02:24:41,880 --> 02:24:45,279
but I've continued healing from there

3146
02:24:43,760 --> 02:24:47,680

3368
02:34:49,880 --> 02:34:55,120
are you trying to exercise a little what

3369
02:34:52,960 --> 02:34:58,040
can you do for

3370
02:34:55,120 --> 02:34:59,920
exercise uh I would probably start

3371
02:34:58,040 --> 02:35:02,439
walking can you're walking yeah you're

3372
02:34:59,920 --> 02:35:06,200
walking and you build up a little more

3373
02:35:02,439 --> 02:35:09,080
muscle to see and that brings up the

3374
02:35:06,200 --> 02:35:11,560
weight so and because you're eating so

3375
02:35:09,080 --> 02:35:14,479
good you should build up muscle

3376
02:35:11,560 --> 02:35:16,560
fast all you have to do is move a little

3377
02:35:14,479 --> 02:35:19,200
and muscle builds quick because you're

3378
02:35:16,560 --> 02:35:20,640
doing all the right things you're giving

3379
02:35:19,200 --> 02:35:22,880
your muscle what they need so once you

3380
02:35:20,640 --> 02:35:25,279
start using them they build really quick

3381
02:35:22,880 --> 02:35:27,680
and then you'll see your weight go up

3382
02:35:25,279 --> 02:35:31,680
and then and also there's no there's no

3383
02:35:27,680 --> 02:35:34,240
portion control so always know that cuz

3384
02:35:31,680 --> 02:35:35,520

tonight

3594
02:45:47,920 --> 02:45:51,960
amazing for

3595
02:46:30,279 --> 02:46:33,760
back in 2015 when I wasn't feeling well

3596
02:46:32,359 --> 02:46:35,399
and had a lot of chronic illness and

3597
02:46:33,760 --> 02:46:38,640
just like everybody in this community we

3598
02:46:35,399 --> 02:46:40,800
come to the information desperate and uh

3599
02:46:38,640 --> 02:46:42,319
we're ready at that point I was ready I

3600
02:46:40,800 --> 02:46:44,720
cried when I heard Anthony the first

3601
02:46:42,319 --> 02:46:46,760
time because it was so overwhelming I

3602
02:46:44,720 --> 02:46:49,000
knew it was truth and it was a really

3603
02:46:46,760 --> 02:46:51,120
big deal but life threw us a lot of Cur

3604
02:46:49,000 --> 02:46:53,640
balls at you and it turned out that I

3605
02:46:51,120 --> 02:46:56,000
went through some really really rough

3606
02:46:53,640 --> 02:46:57,920
stuff in the in the course of the 9

3607
02:46:56,000 --> 02:46:59,840
years when I spoke to him the first time

3608
02:46:57,920 --> 02:47:02,800
he told me I needed some self-compassion

3609
02:46:59,840 --> 02:47:06,040
and I actually went home and Googled it

3610
02:47:02,800 --> 02:47:07,880
what is self-compassion anyway and so

3611
02:47:06,040 --> 02:47:10,680
that started my journey towards

3612
02:47:07,880 --> 02:47:13,279
self-compassion and and I'm here and I'm

3613
02:47:10,680 --> 02:47:16,160
here and that's that's a miracle it's a

3614
02:47:13,279 --> 02:47:19,640
miracle I was in a wheelchair when I

3615
02:47:16,160 --> 02:47:21,359
started um very legally blind still

3616
02:47:19,640 --> 02:47:24,479
still have a lot of vision problems but

3617
02:47:21,359 --> 02:47:27,600
not nearly like I did um it's healing

3618
02:47:24,479 --> 02:47:29,840
and brain fog depersonalization

3619
02:47:27,600 --> 02:47:32,960
depression just a lot of trauma in my

3620
02:47:29,840 --> 02:47:34,760
life and the information has just got me

3621
02:47:32,960 --> 02:47:37,399
out of the wheelchair got me to be able

3622
02:47:34,760 --> 02:47:39,920
to express myself and socialize again

3623
02:47:37,399 --> 02:47:43,479
and not feel alone and just healed so

3624
02:47:39,920 --> 02:47:46,040
much physical neurological pain in 20121

3625
02:47:43,479 --> 02:47:47,880
I got super sick and I dropped 40 lbs in

3626
02:47:46,040 --> 02:47:50,080
30 days the doctors didn't know what's

3627
02:47:47,880 --> 02:47:51,720
wrong with me and they just kept pushing

3628
02:47:50,080 --> 02:47:54,279
medication on me and I would try it and

3629
02:47:51,720 --> 02:47:56,279
flare and got so sick to where I wrote

3630
02:47:54,279 --> 02:47:58,359
like a will out for who my children

3631
02:47:56,279 --> 02:48:00,080
would go to when I died um I could not

3632
02:47:58,359 --> 02:48:02,760
cook I couldn't clean I couldn't drive I

3633
02:48:00,080 --> 02:48:05,520
was on mattress Island for 2 years and I

3634
02:48:02,760 --> 02:48:08,720

3637
02:48:10,840 --> 02:48:13,880
protocols so I reached out to him and

3638
02:48:12,479 --> 02:48:16,359
he's like it's safe it's okay to try

3639
02:48:13,880 --> 02:48:18,120
that there's no way 3 years ago I'd be

3640
02:48:16,359 --> 02:48:19,800

thanks for coming I'm a medical medium

3742
02:52:36,840 --> 02:52:44,399
type 1 diabetic wow and I yes and I hold

3743
02:52:41,319 --> 02:52:45,960
a diabetes support group so on behalf of

3744
02:52:44,399 --> 02:52:47,439
the medical medium diabetic my God

3745
02:52:45,960 --> 02:52:49,000
you're you're out there speaking good

3746
02:52:47,439 --> 02:52:50,040
words

3747
02:52:49,000 --> 02:52:53,120
there're speaking good words about

3748
02:52:50,040 --> 02:52:56,080
medical me in the diabetes world yes of

3749
02:52:53,120 --> 02:52:59,840
course I so I was wondering if there's

3750
02:52:56,080 --> 02:53:01,560
anything you can tell us um for type 1

3751
02:52:59,840 --> 02:53:03,399
diabetics based on whether it's

3752
02:53:01,560 --> 02:53:04,720
reversible or not well you know and I I

3753
02:53:03,399 --> 02:53:06,720
I think I've said this in the books and

3754
02:53:04,720 --> 02:53:10,800
stuff like the pancreas gets injured by

3755
02:53:06,720 --> 02:53:12,840
all these other things so you know think

3756
02:53:10,800 --> 02:53:15,560
about that because the information's

3757
02:53:12,840 --> 02:53:19,120
there it's not just about food it's

3758
02:53:15,560 --> 02:53:21,720
about what caused the pancreas

3759
02:53:19,120 --> 02:53:23,880
injury right like remember the pathogens

3760
02:53:21,720 --> 02:53:25,560
and things like that so what do you do

3761
02:53:23,880 --> 02:53:27,960
when it's pathogens and stuff like that

3762
02:53:25,560 --> 02:53:30,359
you do little things to go after

3763
02:53:27,960 --> 02:53:32,479
pathogens you know so there's there's

3764
02:53:30,359 --> 02:53:34,479
information there so I feel like stress

3765
02:53:32,479 --> 02:53:37,120
and adrenaline is one of the main things

3766
02:53:34,479 --> 02:53:39,120
that injured my pancreas and but it's

3767
02:53:37,120 --> 02:53:40,399
ongoing it's something I constantly am

3768
02:53:39,120 --> 02:53:42,479
struggling with and it's like one of

3769
02:53:40,399 --> 02:53:44,520
those things it's not it's not just like

3770
02:53:42,479 --> 02:53:46,760
straight forward it's a vicious cycle

3771
02:53:44,520 --> 02:53:51,760
but that's one right that's that's it's

3772
02:53:46,760 --> 02:53:55,160
not the the it's not the but it's one

3773
02:53:51,760 --> 02:53:57,680
okay there's lots of things that add to

3774
02:53:55,160 --> 02:53:59,399
it okay and that's one of them but

3775
02:53:57,680 --> 02:54:02,000
you're doing things to protect you with

3776
02:53:59,399 --> 02:54:05,840
your adrenaline too remember that yeah

3777
02:54:02,000 --> 02:54:05,840

okay I uh had a condition of uh kind of

3971
03:03:11,239 --> 03:03:17,880
heavy brain fog for about a decade and I

3972
03:03:13,399 --> 03:03:20,239
saw doctors alternative doctors uh tried

3973
03:03:17,880 --> 03:03:21,720
weird things nothing was working and

3974
03:03:20,239 --> 03:03:24,319
then I found the medical medium

3975
03:03:21,720 --> 03:03:27,479
information and started celery juice and

3976
03:03:24,319 --> 03:03:30,279
within about 3 weeks I started feeling a

3977
03:03:27,479 --> 03:03:33,239
difference and within 3 months like 95%

3978
03:03:30,279 --> 03:03:34,920
gone after that I was sold and um I've

3979
03:03:33,239 --> 03:03:37,040
Incorporated everything into my

3980
03:03:34,920 --> 03:03:39,399
lifestyle since then I end up getting

3981
03:03:37,040 --> 03:03:42,120
sick basically something he calls the

3982
03:03:39,399 --> 03:03:44,760
lme disease trap which lime disease is a

3983
03:03:42,120 --> 03:03:47,080
trap it was supposed to be antibiotics

3984
03:03:44,760 --> 03:03:49,600
bacteria which it's not it's heavy

3985
03:03:47,080 --> 03:03:51,960
metals and vir is I traveled the world

3986
03:03:49,600 --> 03:03:54,479
China Germany seen tons of doctors the

3987
03:03:51,960 --> 03:03:57,000
same story of spending money and I read

3988
03:03:54,479 --> 03:03:59,439
his book on the Lim trap and it was the

3989
03:03:57,000 --> 03:04:02,000
complete opposite of the Matrix that we

3990
03:03:59,439 --> 03:04:04,520
all told and you know I guess

3991
03:04:02,000 --> 03:04:06,720
brainwashed with and I was like wow I

3992
03:04:04,520 --> 03:04:09,479
learned the exact opposite of what it is

3993
03:04:06,720 --> 03:04:12,239
up down left right black

3994
03:04:09,479 --> 03:04:13,720
white and it just blew my mind and I had

3995
03:04:12,239 --> 03:04:17,040
a lot of Dreams after reading that

3996
03:04:13,720 --> 03:04:19,200
chapter and then you know you cry then

3997
03:04:17,040 --> 03:04:20,680
you dive into the material and you start

3998
03:04:19,200 --> 03:04:22,720
healing and then put as much work in as

3999
03:04:20,680 --> 03:04:26,560
you can to get better the first thing

4000
03:04:22,720 --> 03:04:29,479
that healed was my gums regenerated I

4001
03:04:26,560 --> 03:04:31,840

03:12:34,120 --> 03:12:38,120
some good food and I'm proud of you

4182
03:12:43,920 --> 03:12:48,920
right this whole journey for me started

4183
03:12:46,560 --> 03:12:50,920
from my daugh being very very sick we

4184
03:12:48,920 --> 03:12:52,640
did all the regular stuff like went to

4185
03:12:50,920 --> 03:12:54,439
the doctor they said it was all in her

4186
03:12:52,640 --> 03:12:56,560
head tried different things nothing

4187
03:12:54,439 --> 03:12:58,319
really seemed to help but then as I

4188
03:12:56,560 --> 03:13:00,399
started discovering more medical medium

4189
03:12:58,319 --> 03:13:02,560
information and applying more of it it

4190
03:13:00,399 --> 03:13:04,319
started to help and then she hit a point

4191
03:13:02,560 --> 03:13:06,640
where she had like a trigger and it got

4192
03:13:04,319 --> 03:13:08,279
way worse as a mom like all you want is

4193
03:13:06,640 --> 03:13:10,680
your kids to be healthy and your family

4194
03:13:08,279 --> 03:13:12,920
to thrive and when you see your your

4195
03:13:10,680 --> 03:13:14,319
people suffering and you don't know how

4196
03:13:12,920 --> 03:13:16,239
to help them and the doctors don't know

4197
03:13:14,319 --> 03:13:17,800
how to help them it's just honestly one

4198
03:13:16,239 --> 03:13:19,239
of the worst feelings

4199
03:13:17,800 --> 03:13:21,319
possible we reached out to a

4200
03:13:19,239 --> 03:13:23,880
practitioner and worked with her and

4201
03:13:21,319 --> 03:13:25,840
over the course of almost 2 years she

4202
03:13:23,880 --> 03:13:30,400
went from being bed bound to now getting

4203
03:13:25,840 --> 03:13:36,309
back into her life so just beyond

4204
03:13:30,400 --> 03:13:36,309
[Music]

4205
03:13:36,319 --> 03:13:40,920
grateful this man has changed my life

4206
03:13:38,800 --> 03:13:42,840
Anthony William now I'm reading the

4207
03:13:40,920 --> 03:13:44,800
books I know that I was sick for a long

4208
03:13:42,840 --> 03:13:46,560
time since I was a baby my whole

4209
03:13:44,800 --> 03:13:48,000
childhood basically there was always

4210
03:13:46,560 --> 03:13:49,279
something wrong I'm the one with the

4211
03:13:48,000 --> 03:13:50,520
allergies I'm the one that had to be

4212
03:13:49,279 --> 03:13:52,840
going to the doctor all the time I'm the

4213
03:13:50,520 --> 03:13:55,760
one with the acne I was on like

4214
03:13:52,840 --> 03:13:57,720
medications that really messed me up and

4215
03:13:55,760 --> 03:14:00,279
I never knew why I was always the sick

4216
03:13:57,720 --> 03:14:02,399
one right and then I had my babies and

4217
03:14:00,279 --> 03:14:04,520
then boom like my whole world crashed

4218
03:14:02,399 --> 03:14:05,920
down because I got lupus it's been

4219
03:14:04,520 --> 03:14:07,920
something that I've been fighting and

4220
03:14:05,920 --> 03:14:09,439
looking for and I'm a biologist I study

4221
03:14:07,920 --> 03:14:11,720
biology I have a master's degree in

4222
03:14:09,439 --> 03:14:12,439
biology I was in biotech I couldn't find

4223
03:14:11,720 --> 03:14:14,720
the

4224
03:14:12,439 --> 03:14:16,560
answers and then when I found well my

4225
03:14:14,720 --> 03:14:18,880
friend told me about him and he said you

4226
03:14:16,560 --> 03:14:21,120
will love his book Because You Love

4227
03:14:18,880 --> 03:14:23,200
angels and I had been praying I've

4228
03:14:21,120 --> 03:14:25,880
always prayed to God I've always asked

4229
03:14:23,200 --> 03:14:28,200
his angels to help me finally when I got

4230
03:14:25,880 --> 03:14:30,279
the book and I read that one chapter on

4231
03:14:28,200 --> 03:14:32,359
the Angels I'm like this is the

4232
03:14:30,279 --> 03:14:34,600

4661
03:50:39,040 --> 03:50:44,319
sushi and I was so glad to see that

4662
03:50:41,520 --> 03:50:46,439
they're using pumpkin tofu because

4663
03:50:44,319 --> 03:50:48,880
people think of it as tofu it really is

4664
03:50:46,439 --> 03:50:51,640
not it's made out of pumpkin seed and I

4665
03:50:48,880 --> 03:50:54,479
was thrilled to see them using that as a

4666
03:50:51,640 --> 03:50:56,880
delicacy yes yeah I love the

4667
03:50:54,479 --> 03:50:59,600
Mediterranean pizza it was so good I

4668
03:50:56,880 --> 03:51:02,120
love camada olives and pesto so it was

4669
03:50:59,600 --> 03:51:06,120
so delicious yeah I loved that

4670
03:51:02,120 --> 03:51:07,560
yeah I love both pizzas so much um I

4671
03:51:06,120 --> 03:51:10,800
wish that I could share it with my

4672
03:51:07,560 --> 03:51:13,840
family back on the East Coast um they

4673
03:51:10,800 --> 03:51:15,600
were just absolutely delicious and uh I

4674
03:51:13,840 --> 03:51:18,239
wish I could have this every day and I

4675
03:51:15,600 --> 03:51:18,239
wish I could have

4676
03:51:18,319 --> 03:51:23,720
more I'm always a fan of the sushi um

4677
03:51:21,439 --> 03:51:25,479
I'm local so I come to Cafe Gratitude a

4678
03:51:23,720 --> 03:51:28,680
lot and I think I ordered the sushi

4679
03:51:25,479 --> 03:51:30,880
maybe like 30 times since it came out

4680
03:51:28,680 --> 03:51:32,800
yeah great that you're local do you

4681
03:51:30,880 --> 03:51:34,880
think that having these items on the

4682
03:51:32,800 --> 03:51:36,800
menu will help your healing journey and

4683
03:51:34,880 --> 03:51:39,399
be help it to be more enjoyable and a

4684
03:51:36,800 --> 03:51:41,439
bit easier as well definitely because

4685
03:51:39,399 --> 03:51:43,880
prior to this it's not like I was ever

4686
03:51:41,439 --> 03:51:45,720
able to order a takeout or anything um

4687
03:51:43,880 --> 03:51:47,720
so this is a really great option to have

4688
03:51:45,720 --> 03:51:50,319
for me to feel like I'm like partaking

4689
03:51:47,720 --> 03:51:52,399
in normal life while still on the

4690
03:51:50,319 --> 03:51:54,560
healing journey and now they have the

4691
03:51:52,399 --> 03:51:56,399
cleanse option that's available to order

4692
03:51:54,560 --> 03:51:58,439
as well I think that's great because it

4693
03:51:56,399 --> 03:52:00,000
makes it a little less daunting for some

4694
03:51:58,439 --> 03:52:01,319
people as well and it saves a lot of

4695
03:52:00,000 --> 03:52:03,840
time in the kitchen it's just very

4696
03:52:01,319 --> 03:52:06,000
convenient right definitely yeah I think

4697
03:52:03,840 --> 03:52:09,439

said this last night people say you know

4800
04:04:03,159 --> 04:04:07,040
they talk about demons they say

4801
04:04:05,239 --> 04:04:09,399
something about demons or that person's

4802
04:04:07,040 --> 04:04:12,479
a demon or whatever it is you know it's

4803
04:04:09,399 --> 04:04:15,600
been in the verb for centuries it's been

4804
04:04:12,479 --> 04:04:19,239
in the verb of you know civilization

4805
04:04:15,600 --> 04:04:20,800
here right but yet no you know it's

4806
04:04:19,239 --> 04:04:22,920
really just nonsense it's just for the

4807
04:04:20,800 --> 04:04:24,600
movies it's just you know what I mean

4808
04:04:22,920 --> 04:04:27,560
it's just make believe but the

4809
04:04:24,600 --> 04:04:29,520
information that came down might have

4810
04:04:27,560 --> 04:04:32,600
you thinking a little different when you

4811
04:04:29,520 --> 04:04:35,319
hear about it when you hear about like

4812
04:04:32,600 --> 04:04:37,159
where the word demon really came from

4813
04:04:35,319 --> 04:04:39,960
what was the word before it how did it

4814
04:04:37,159 --> 04:04:42,159
start that's one thing on its own I mean

4815
04:04:39,960 --> 04:04:44,279
that piece of information is just to tip

4816
04:04:42,159 --> 04:04:46,880
the iceberg

4817
04:04:44,279 --> 04:04:50,120
look look I'm nervous even talking about

4818
04:04:46,880 --> 04:04:52,319
this audio this original audio because

4819
04:04:50,120 --> 04:04:54,159
the information is so mindblowing that

4820
04:04:52,319 --> 04:04:56,199
you know I'm probably going to take some

4821
04:04:54,159 --> 04:04:58,439
hits for you know there's going to be

4822
04:04:56,199 --> 04:05:00,960
probably some hate because you know

4823
04:04:58,439 --> 04:05:02,920
people like they want a good reason to

4824
04:05:00,960 --> 04:05:05,920
hate out there you know do there's a lot

4825
04:05:02,920 --> 04:05:07,960
of people that want a reason to hate and

4826
04:05:05,920 --> 04:05:10,080
there and there's and there's a lot of

4827
04:05:07,960 --> 04:05:12,720
people that don't want that obviously

4828
04:05:10,080 --> 04:05:14,439
but this information is controversial

4829
04:05:12,720 --> 04:05:16,800
controversial

4830
04:05:14,439 --> 04:05:18,239
that that's the difference but but

4831
04:05:16,800 --> 04:05:21,680
spiritually

4832
04:05:18,239 --> 04:05:23,920
controversial and it challenges belief

4833
04:05:21,680 --> 04:05:26,520
systems it challenges

4834
04:05:23,920 --> 04:05:28,920
religions and the one thing

4835
04:05:26,520 --> 04:05:31,199
about the one thing about angels demons

4836
04:05:28,920 --> 04:05:33,120
and spiritual tools the one thing about

4837
04:05:31,199 --> 04:05:35,600
this interesting is that I've

4838
04:05:33,120 --> 04:05:37,399
Incorporated information for my

4839
04:05:35,600 --> 04:05:39,319
spiritual belief system in there so it

4840
04:05:37,399 --> 04:05:41,920
doesn't matter what it doesn't matter

4841
04:05:39,319 --> 04:05:44,199
what belief system what religion what

4842
04:05:41,920 --> 04:05:46,720
you subscribe to what you believe in

4843
04:05:44,199 --> 04:05:48,760
what your faith is you can use this

4844
04:05:46,720 --> 04:05:50,399

4849
04:05:55,720 --> 04:05:59,600
plant-based and still use the tools to

4850
04:05:57,479 --> 04:06:03,600

4939
04:09:35,760 --> 04:09:40,279
anywhere it's been published in medical

4940
04:09:37,439 --> 04:09:41,880

04:10:36,199 --> 04:10:41,319
your collagen medical medium information

4966
04:10:38,439 --> 04:10:43,399
was like no you need the building blocks

4967
04:10:41,319 --> 04:10:44,880
to build collagen and now look you hear

4968
04:10:43,399 --> 04:10:46,399
it on you know there's podcasts out

4969
04:10:44,880 --> 04:10:47,560
there and podcast doctors people always

4970
04:10:46,399 --> 04:10:49,000
tell me like you wouldn't believe what

4971
04:10:47,560 --> 04:10:53,479
this person's saying they're they took

4972
04:10:49,000 --> 04:10:56,920
your info it's leading the way it has it

4973
04:10:53,479 --> 04:10:58,439
still is it just it just is you know and

4974
04:10:56,920 --> 04:11:00,080
that's what's incredible about it

4975
04:10:58,439 --> 04:11:02,279
because Spirit compassion is leading the

4976
04:11:00,080 --> 04:11:05,040
way with this and people they don't have

4977
04:11:02,279 --> 04:11:07,119
to believe in spirit they don't have to

4978
04:11:05,040 --> 04:11:10,319
have a spiritual belief they don't have

4979
04:11:07,119 --> 04:11:13,319
to think I hear a voice or not since age

4980
04:11:10,319 --> 04:11:15,800
four I have they just need to do the

4981
04:11:13,319 --> 04:11:18,720
information and heal and move forward

4982
04:11:15,800 --> 04:11:22,399
you know and that's okay with me but the

4983
04:11:18,720 --> 04:11:25,080
the you know the sad part is is that the

4984
04:11:22,399 --> 04:11:27,040
health movement has changed it is

4985
04:11:25,080 --> 04:11:28,920
completely the Whole Health movement has

4986
04:11:27,040 --> 04:11:31,880
altered because of medical medum

4987
04:11:28,920 --> 04:11:36,840
information it's gotten into every

4988
04:11:31,880 --> 04:11:38,560
aspect of of um the health world the sad

4989
04:11:36,840 --> 04:11:41,000
part is that's the good part the sad

4990
04:11:38,560 --> 04:11:43,279
part is people can't find their way to

4991
04:11:41,000 --> 04:11:46,399
the rest of the information they hear

4992
04:11:43,279 --> 04:11:49,760
tidbits here tidbits there you know bioh

4993
04:11:46,399 --> 04:11:51,680
hacks and biohackers are using it you

4994
04:11:49,760 --> 04:11:53,359
know what I mean but they're not they're

4995
04:11:51,680 --> 04:11:55,800
not getting the rest of it because

4996
04:11:53,359 --> 04:11:58,920
people aren't citing it back enough to

4997
04:11:55,800 --> 04:12:01,439
say oh that came from here now you can

4998
04:11:58,920 --> 04:12:04,000
heal your psoriasis that came from here

4999
04:12:01,439 --> 04:12:06,880
you can heal your multiple sceris you

5000
04:12:04,000 --> 04:12:09,159

5001
04:12:06,880 --> 04:12:12,359
you just need the rest of it it's not

5002
04:12:09,159 --> 04:12:15,119
just this or this you can do all of it

5003
04:12:12,359 --> 04:12:17,319
and that's a sad heart that um there's

5004
04:12:15,119 --> 04:12:20,880
enough people with Integrity out there

5005
04:12:17,319 --> 04:12:22,840
to say oh crap I stole that information

5006
04:12:20,880 --> 04:12:25,439
to try to get some more clicks and and

5007
04:12:22,840 --> 04:12:27,520
likes and more you know views but I

5008
04:12:25,439 --> 04:12:28,760
don't want to say where I got it from

5009
04:12:27,520 --> 04:12:31,119
and then you you got to think about

5010
04:12:28,760 --> 04:12:33,159
somebody who's chronically sick yeah how

5011
04:12:31,119 --> 04:12:35,680
can you have like how can you be that

5012
04:12:33,159 --> 04:12:38,479
way and not just be like look to be

5013
04:12:35,680 --> 04:12:41,920
honest this guy here he wrote all these

books it's changed all these lives

5015
04:12:41,920 --> 04:12:45,439
that's where you can find the rest of it

5016
04:12:43,880 --> 04:12:48,239
yeah but people don't have that

5017
04:12:45,439 --> 04:12:49,840
Integrity anymore maybe somebody does

5018
04:12:48,239 --> 04:12:52,040
but not a lot when it comes down to the

5019
04:12:49,840 --> 04:12:54,159
doggy dog world of Health it's it's

5020
04:12:52,040 --> 04:12:56,159
pretty sad well talking about people who

5021
04:12:54,159 --> 04:12:58,279

well what is the difference between

5060

biohacking and medical maum because you

5061
04:14:29,359 --> 04:14:32,520
mentioned biohacking that's just musical

5062
04:14:30,880 --> 04:14:34,359
chairs you know biohacking is musical

5063
04:14:32,520 --> 04:14:35,600
chairs everybody wants a Magic Bullet

5064
04:14:34,359 --> 04:14:37,520
they wanted you know they want this

5065
04:14:35,600 --> 04:14:38,960
Magic Bullet and this one fish oil it

5068
04:14:41,239 --> 04:14:45,279
you that that's gone now very very few

5069
04:14:43,399 --> 04:14:48,119
people take fish oil supplements like

5070
04:14:45,279 --> 04:14:50,439
they used to because of mm info it's

5071
04:14:48,119 --> 04:14:52,600
like the biohacks oh maybe it's fish oil

5072
04:14:50,439 --> 04:14:54,640
maybe it's collagen maybe it's charcoal

5073
04:14:52,600 --> 04:14:56,600
maybe it's ionizer water which is

5074
04:14:54,640 --> 04:14:58,279
terrible for you maybe it's this maybe

5075
04:14:56,600 --> 04:15:00,800
it's that and that's how maybe it's

5076
04:14:58,279 --> 04:15:03,119
Pearl powder maybe it's this it's just

5077
04:15:00,800 --> 04:15:05,239
it's endless out there biohacking this

5078
04:15:03,119 --> 04:15:07,359
biohacking that you know put electrodes

5079
04:15:05,239 --> 04:15:09,239
on your brain and run on the treadmill

5080
04:15:07,359 --> 04:15:11,399
you know why some you know like some

5081
04:15:09,239 --> 04:15:13,080
neuroscientists is like oh wait a minute

5082
04:15:11,399 --> 04:15:14,640
there's a little more heat on this side

5083
04:15:13,080 --> 04:15:16,439
there's a little more heat on that side

5084
04:15:14,640 --> 04:15:18,319
you got the answers you know here's

5085
04:15:16,439 --> 04:15:20,359
longevity here's this it's just constant

5086
04:15:18,319 --> 04:15:22,080
biohacking crap but when you're sick

5087
04:15:20,359 --> 04:15:25,000
with chronic illness all that's

5088
04:15:22,080 --> 04:15:28,680
worthless it's musical chairs around and

5089
04:15:25,000 --> 04:15:30,800
around we go and then you lose time and

5090
04:15:28,680 --> 04:15:32,920
so the thing is the medical M Community

5091
04:15:30,800 --> 04:15:35,199
they know about this they're seasoned

5092
04:15:32,920 --> 04:15:37,800
they tried everything for 10 years 15 20

5093
04:15:35,199 --> 04:15:39,439
years they fought their way back and now

5094
04:15:37,800 --> 04:15:41,680
they're here they found something that

5095
04:15:39,439 --> 04:15:44,319
works and then they see they got eyes to

5096
04:15:41,680 --> 04:15:46,359
see now they're wise they look out and

5097
04:15:44,319 --> 04:15:48,239
they see all the bull and they see all

5098
04:15:46,359 --> 04:15:50,760
the tricks and they see all the gimmicks

5099
04:15:48,239 --> 04:15:53,600
and the ads and the advertisers and all

5100
04:15:50,760 --> 04:15:56,080
of that it's all just a game and they

5101
04:15:53,600 --> 04:15:58,040
feed off of the chronically ill that's

5102
04:15:56,080 --> 04:16:00,720
the point too you know they feed off the

5103
04:15:58,040 --> 04:16:02,760
chronically ill so it's it's scary and

5104
04:16:00,720 --> 04:16:05,560
medical medum communities is is has

5105
04:16:02,760 --> 04:16:07,760
Integrity it's people who care have

5106
04:16:05,560 --> 04:16:09,199
compassion and they've learned they've

5107
04:16:07,760 --> 04:16:11,960
learned what it's like out there they

they want the truth they want the truth

5110
04:16:14,319 --> 04:16:18,399

5184
04:19:01,800 --> 04:19:05,840
pizza party who could ask for anything

5185
04:19:03,680 --> 04:19:07,359
more it's amazing I know I know it's

5186
04:19:05,840 --> 04:19:09,680
incredible and there's so much more to

5187
04:19:07,359 --> 04:19:11,760
go tonight don't go anywhere guys we got

5188
04:19:09,680 --> 04:19:13,600
the lecture coming up the light blast

5189
04:19:11,760 --> 04:19:15,760
it's incredible up who knows what's

5190
04:19:13,600 --> 04:19:18,560
going to come out of my mouth flying out

5191
04:19:15,760 --> 04:19:20,760
of it so we'll see hopefully you know

5192
04:19:18,560 --> 04:19:24,800
and that's the thing though it's funny

5193
04:19:20,760 --> 04:19:27,359
because um you know I I do a lot of live

5194
04:19:24,800 --> 04:19:29,640
stuff I don't do a lot of video stuff

5195
04:19:27,359 --> 04:19:31,520
and then the video stuff gets post it

5196
04:19:29,640 --> 04:19:32,960
it's only if for some reason I couldn't

5197
04:19:31,520 --> 04:19:36,000
get a live done or whatever or whatever

5198
04:19:32,960 --> 04:19:38,760
it is so but I I I make this like who

5199
04:19:36,000 --> 04:19:40,520
would do this maybe maybe it's a crazy

5200
04:19:38,760 --> 04:19:44,479
thing to do but who would do this I just

5201
04:19:40,520 --> 04:19:46,680
want people to out there see that you

5202
04:19:44,479 --> 04:19:48,040
know you can heal so I want them to be

5203
04:19:46,680 --> 04:19:50,040
able to be a part of this because

5204
04:19:48,040 --> 04:19:52,560
someone's sitting out there and they're

5205
04:19:50,040 --> 04:19:54,399
sick even if it's just one person

5206
04:19:52,560 --> 04:19:55,840
they're sick and this is going to be a

5207
04:19:54,399 --> 04:19:58,560
moment where they're going to be like

5208
04:19:55,840 --> 04:20:01,439
you know what I I like this guy a little

5209
04:19:58,560 --> 04:20:03,880
bit um look at him he's he's live right

5210
04:20:01,439 --> 04:20:06,800
now I I'm going to do medical medium and

5211
04:20:03,880 --> 04:20:08,840
heal and you get one person better this

5212
04:20:06,800 --> 04:20:11,159
that every every person counts yeah

5213
04:20:08,840 --> 04:20:12,800
every person counts but I like to do

5214
04:20:11,159 --> 04:20:14,199
things live I don't care if I make

5215
04:20:12,800 --> 04:20:16,239
mistake I don't care if I fall in my

5216
04:20:14,199 --> 04:20:19,319
face it doesn't matter that's what I

5217
04:20:16,239 --> 04:20:21,359
like doing the the lives I do normally

5218
04:20:19,319 --> 04:20:24,520
all these years and that's why I like

5219
04:20:21,359 --> 04:20:27,960
doing this live stream here I like you

5220
04:20:24,520 --> 04:20:31,319
know it's it's it's risky I used to do

5221
04:20:27,960 --> 04:20:34,720
all the podcast live MH but it's worth

5222
04:20:31,319 --> 04:20:36,399
it because you want people to just know

5223
04:20:34,720 --> 04:20:39,119
that your heart's in it I'm willing to

5224
04:20:36,399 --> 04:20:41,439
take a risk I'm not trying to hide

5225
04:20:39,119 --> 04:20:43,319
anything I might say something I might

5226
04:20:41,439 --> 04:20:45,720
say a word that may not make sense for a

5227
04:20:43,319 --> 04:20:47,520
minute it doesn't matter whatever it is

5228
04:20:45,720 --> 04:20:49,359
it's just I'm in it with you that's the

5229
04:20:47,520 --> 04:20:51,239
whole point and that's the key I'm in it

5230
04:20:49,359 --> 04:20:53,479
with you I need people to know that I'm

5231
04:20:51,239 --> 04:20:55,760
dedicated because I am and that's the

5232
04:20:53,479 --> 04:20:56,960
key it's the dedication so yeah we're

5233
04:20:55,760 --> 04:21:00,040
live right now and I'm going to be doing

5234
04:20:56,960 --> 04:21:02,199

so I didn't come into this really easy I

5349
04:46:24,440 --> 04:46:29,520
came in kicking and screaming since I

5350
04:46:27,400 --> 04:46:31,400
was a child since I was younger okay

5351
04:46:29,520 --> 04:46:33,440
that's what I did I came in Kicking and

5352
04:46:31,400 --> 04:46:35,840
Screaming did you ever read the first

5353
04:46:33,440 --> 04:46:39,600
book medical medium

5354
04:46:35,840 --> 04:46:41,240
right okay I should have put even more

5355
04:46:39,600 --> 04:46:42,080
in there about how much I was Kicking

5356
04:46:41,240 --> 04:46:44,400
and

5357
04:46:42,080 --> 04:46:47,520
Screaming I kind of kept it out I was

5358
04:46:44,400 --> 04:46:49,520
like oh no I I can't talk about that I

5359
04:46:47,520 --> 04:46:52,638
can't talk about this no no do you

5360
04:46:49,520 --> 04:46:56,600
remember my dog right

5361
04:46:52,638 --> 04:46:59,040
August right you know that was a special

5362
04:46:56,600 --> 04:47:01,600
moment in my life right I I went into

5363
04:46:59,040 --> 04:47:04,680
the water it was a cold water in Maine

5364
04:47:01,600 --> 04:47:07,600
all right up north on the East Coast

5365
04:47:04,680 --> 04:47:10,480
okay and the water was frigid freezing

5366
04:47:07,600 --> 04:47:12,280
cold and basically I wanted to say my

5367
04:47:10,480 --> 04:47:14,040
dog that got caught in the

5368
04:47:12,280 --> 04:47:16,600
current

5369
04:47:14,040 --> 04:47:19,040
and when I jumped in spirit of

5370
04:47:16,600 --> 04:47:21,718
compassion said that's a death sentence

5371
04:47:19,040 --> 04:47:23,558
you're not coming back out of here

5372
04:47:21,718 --> 04:47:25,878
you're not you're not going to make it

5373
04:47:23,558 --> 04:47:28,080
back out of here you have to turn around

5374
04:47:25,878 --> 04:47:29,840
and I saw my dog way out there like

5375
04:47:28,080 --> 04:47:32,080
caught in a little bit of seaweed and

5376
04:47:29,840 --> 04:47:35,080
kind of going down and I said I don't

5377
04:47:32,080 --> 04:47:37,840
care what it takes because I need to do

5378
04:47:35,080 --> 04:47:40,440
this does it matter I have to do this I

5379
04:47:37,840 --> 04:47:42,878
remember when I got out there and I had

5380
04:47:40,440 --> 04:47:45,040
a few more more breaths left in me and I

5381
04:47:42,878 --> 04:47:48,200
went down in the water and I saw my dog

5382
04:47:45,040 --> 04:47:51,400
under the water okay and do you guys

5383
04:47:48,200 --> 04:47:54,120
remember what happened you

5384
04:47:51,400 --> 04:47:56,280
remember I opened my eyes in that water

5385
04:47:54,120 --> 04:48:00,840
down there that freezing cold water and

5386
04:47:56,280 --> 04:48:05,240
there was an angel holding on to my dog

5387
04:48:00,840 --> 04:48:05,240
underwater yeah all

5388
04:48:06,080 --> 04:48:10,840
right

5389
04:48:08,080 --> 04:48:13,638
yeah and I grabbed that dog out of the

5390
04:48:10,840 --> 04:48:15,240
Angel's hands and I just took my dog to

5391
04:48:13,638 --> 04:48:19,040
the surface

5392
04:48:15,240 --> 04:48:20,920
August and then Spirit of compassion

5393
04:48:19,040 --> 04:48:24,240
second time ever did it did did did you

5394
04:48:20,920 --> 04:48:26,600
read that part second time ever I saw

5395
04:48:24,240 --> 04:48:29,040
Spirit of compassion it's not like I see

5396
04:48:26,600 --> 04:48:31,958
Spirit of compassion it's rare it's it

5397
04:48:29,040 --> 04:48:33,520
was the second time and I got to that

5398
04:48:31,958 --> 04:48:35,080
water and spirit of compassion said you

5399
04:48:33,520 --> 04:48:37,760
got to get back

5400
04:48:35,080 --> 04:48:40,878
now you got to get back now because that

5401
04:48:37,760 --> 04:48:44,400
angel isn't going to be sticking around

5402
04:48:40,878 --> 04:48:46,160
because I was lucky that angel was there

5403
04:48:44,400 --> 04:48:48,798
but Angel wasn't going to stay around

5404
04:48:46,160 --> 04:48:51,280
and have me Meander because I was only

5405
04:48:48,798 --> 04:48:54,360
basically living off of that Angelic

5406
04:48:51,280 --> 04:48:57,120
light in that moment in that water

5407
04:48:54,360 --> 04:48:59,718
because I was already in

5408
04:48:57,120 --> 04:49:03,440
hypothermia

5409
04:48:59,718 --> 04:49:06,638
hypothermia so I came back to

5410
04:49:03,440 --> 04:49:09,200
shore I was alive and I knew I had to

5411
04:49:06,638 --> 04:49:10,958
make the commitment there and wasn't

5412
04:49:09,200 --> 04:49:13,840
going to kick and scream anymore and I

5413
04:49:10,958 --> 04:49:16,200
wasn't going to fight fight fight it and

5414
04:49:13,840 --> 04:49:18,480
fight hearing Spirit of compassion and I

5415
04:49:16,200 --> 04:49:20,120
knew this is the direction I had to go

5416
04:49:18,480 --> 04:49:23,160
it didn't matter what I really wanted to

5417
04:49:20,120 --> 04:49:25,040
do never was about that but I had to

5418
04:49:23,160 --> 04:49:27,280
make that commitment and I had to stand

5419
04:49:25,040 --> 04:49:32,080
strong and I had to be like no this is

5420
04:49:27,280 --> 04:49:35,200
it I'm committed now I am I can't unsee

5421
04:49:32,080 --> 04:49:38,558
what I saw under that water that angel

5422
04:49:35,200 --> 04:49:40,760
was there I hear a voice I saw a spirit

5423
04:49:38,558 --> 04:49:42,920
of compassion twice in my life can't

5424
04:49:40,760 --> 04:49:45,718
unsee

5425
04:49:42,920 --> 04:49:47,280
that so I have to work for the

5426
04:49:45,718 --> 04:49:50,680
chronically ill I have to work for the

5427
04:49:47,280 --> 04:49:54,360
people I have to do it no matter what

5428
04:49:50,680 --> 04:49:57,040
you know when we get sick sometimes we

5429
04:49:54,360 --> 04:50:00,120
kick and scream too

5430
04:49:57,040 --> 04:50:02,440
right we do I've heard of stories where

5431
04:50:00,120 --> 04:50:04,520
people are like I wanted to do medical

5432
04:50:02,440 --> 04:50:07,000
medium it just wasn't there it just

5433
04:50:04,520 --> 04:50:09,798
wasn't there yet do you ever hear of

5434
04:50:07,000 --> 04:50:11,718
anybody like that wanted to try medical

5435
04:50:09,798 --> 04:50:14,680
medium information and it just wasn't

5436
04:50:11,718 --> 04:50:17,400
there yet right kind of kicking and

5437
04:50:14,680 --> 04:50:19,680
screaming to get to the truth to get to

5438
04:50:17,400 --> 04:50:22,520
the information

5439
04:50:19,680 --> 04:50:24,240
right I've seen that out there well I

5440
04:50:22,520 --> 04:50:26,718
had a kick and scream to get to here and

5441
04:50:24,240 --> 04:50:27,840
I know that other people do too to get

5442
04:50:26,718 --> 04:50:31,718
to this

5443
04:50:27,840 --> 04:50:33,558
point and then they find the

5444
04:50:31,718 --> 04:50:36,718
information and now it's about

5445
04:50:33,558 --> 04:50:39,120
committing time and energy that takes a

5446
04:50:36,718 --> 04:50:41,120
kick in a scream you start with a little

5447
04:50:39,120 --> 04:50:43,160
bit of celery juice or you start with

5448
04:50:41,120 --> 04:50:45,120
maybe one of the meditations or you

5449
04:50:43,160 --> 04:50:48,080
start with something

5450
04:50:45,120 --> 04:50:51,638
right but you eventually get there and

5451
04:50:48,080 --> 04:50:56,120
then you're committed and now you're in

5452
04:50:51,638 --> 04:50:58,080
it and guess what happens then freedom

5453
04:50:56,120 --> 04:51:02,120
and you know what happened when I

5454
04:50:58,080 --> 04:51:06,760
rescued August in that cold ocean

5455
04:51:02,120 --> 04:51:08,440
water and I hit the shore it was Freedom

5456
04:51:06,760 --> 04:51:12,240
it was freedom I didn't have to fight it

5457
04:51:08,440 --> 04:51:14,000
anymore I was committed all the way

5458
04:51:12,240 --> 04:51:17,600
I wasn't just saying it

5459
04:51:14,000 --> 04:51:21,120
anymore before that I would say it yeah

5460
04:51:17,600 --> 04:51:23,718
yeah no I'm in I'm in I'm in but no

5461
04:51:21,120 --> 04:51:25,558
after that and I hit the shore I had my

5462
04:51:23,718 --> 04:51:29,558
dog in my

5463
04:51:25,558 --> 04:51:32,840
arms I was committed and freedom started

5464
04:51:29,558 --> 04:51:35,240
for me freedom of being like kind of on

5465
04:51:32,840 --> 04:51:38,000
the fence a little bit and fighting it

5466
04:51:35,240 --> 04:51:39,920

like wow this is incredible oh my God I

5501
04:52:53,958 --> 04:52:59,480
can't believe it not because I'm trying

5502
04:52:56,878 --> 04:53:02,558
to like you know my head's all swelling

5503
04:52:59,480 --> 04:53:04,480
and I'm like egoed out it's because it's

5504
04:53:02,558 --> 04:53:06,520
not my words they're it's Spirit of

5505
04:53:04,480 --> 04:53:08,558
compassion's words so then when I'm away

5506
04:53:06,520 --> 04:53:11,360
from it a little bit I forget kind of

5507
04:53:08,558 --> 04:53:13,920
what Spirit of compassion said so then I

5508
04:53:11,360 --> 04:53:16,878
got to listen to the episode and be like

5509
04:53:13,920 --> 04:53:20,240
damn that's just oh my

5510
04:53:16,878 --> 04:53:23,718
God you didn't let me down you didn't

5511
04:53:20,240 --> 04:53:25,080
let me down you showed up for me man you

5512
04:53:23,718 --> 04:53:28,240
showed up for

5513
04:53:25,080 --> 04:53:29,920
me your free will is like no other Free

5514
04:53:28,240 --> 04:53:31,958
Will I can tell you that because you can

5515
04:53:29,920 --> 04:53:35,680
have free will and use it all the wrong

5516
04:53:31,958 --> 04:53:37,480
way you can have free will and screw up

5517
04:53:35,680 --> 04:53:39,200
sure that's life that's how it works

5518
04:53:37,480 --> 04:53:40,680
down here on planet Earth of course

5519
04:53:39,200 --> 04:53:42,440
everybody makes mistakes all all the

5520
04:53:40,680 --> 04:53:44,958
time they use their Free Will in doing

5521
04:53:42,440 --> 04:53:46,760
it but also they get blocked too so

5522
04:53:44,958 --> 04:53:49,000
they're on autopilot with their Free

5523
04:53:46,760 --> 04:53:50,878
Will and they start using their Free

5524
04:53:49,000 --> 04:53:53,558
Will without kind of realizing it it

5525
04:53:50,878 --> 04:53:55,558
gets used instantly like compulsion it's

5526
04:53:53,558 --> 04:53:59,520
free will that's not really in their

5527
04:53:55,558 --> 04:54:01,878
favor serving them it's not serving them

5528
04:53:59,520 --> 04:54:03,840
right I just got comfortable using that

5529
04:54:01,878 --> 04:54:05,520
word recently because in the New Age

5530
04:54:03,840 --> 04:54:08,760
movement it's like you know things that

5531
04:54:05,520 --> 04:54:10,878
serve you and stuff serve you okay but

5532
04:54:08,760 --> 04:54:12,718
yeah it wasn't serving people the way

5533
04:54:10,878 --> 04:54:15,480
the way it works with free will

5534
04:54:12,718 --> 04:54:18,320
sometimes but you guys you did something

5535
04:54:15,480 --> 04:54:21,440
different like you shifted your free

5536
04:54:18,320 --> 04:54:23,360
will into a whole different area like

5537
04:54:21,440 --> 04:54:25,400
you really are using your free will you

5538
04:54:23,360 --> 04:54:29,000
got control over your free will how

5539
04:54:25,400 --> 04:54:31,120
about that control over it that's

5540
04:54:29,000 --> 04:54:34,280
mindblowing right there all on its own

5541
04:54:31,120 --> 04:54:37,520
think about that okay there's a

5542
04:54:34,280 --> 04:54:38,320
difference because you guys are piloting

5543
04:54:37,520 --> 04:54:42,280
your

5544
04:54:38,320 --> 04:54:45,440
ships you are piloting your

5545
04:54:42,280 --> 04:54:47,480
ship you really are something to be said

5546
04:54:45,440 --> 04:54:49,240
it's something to know you guys have

5547
04:54:47,480 --> 04:54:50,798
committed yourselves you're in it you're

5548
04:54:49,240 --> 04:54:53,480
in it to heal your body and guess who

5549
04:54:50,798 --> 04:54:56,680
loves you for it who loves you for being

5550
04:54:53,480 --> 04:54:58,000
committed your body your body loves you

5551
04:54:56,680 --> 04:54:59,320
how many of you guys thought that it was

5552
04:54:58,000 --> 04:55:01,920
your fault you were sick that's what I

5553
04:54:59,320 --> 04:55:03,558
wanted to ask you guys you thought it

5554
04:55:01,920 --> 04:55:04,920
was your fault Tobias over there you

5555
04:55:03,558 --> 04:55:09,040
thought it was your

5556
04:55:04,920 --> 04:55:11,400
fault right yeah isn't that crazy how it

5557
04:55:09,040 --> 04:55:13,878
works you're not crazy the system set up

5558
04:55:11,400 --> 04:55:15,878
like that it's set up so that you think

5559
04:55:13,878 --> 04:55:18,958
you're the reason why you're sick it's

5560
04:55:15,878 --> 04:55:22,440
your fault you created it how many of

5561
04:55:18,958 --> 04:55:25,000
you guys searching while you were sick

5562
04:55:22,440 --> 04:55:28,080
came across the understanding that you

5563
04:55:25,000 --> 04:55:29,920
created your illness you manifested it

5564
04:55:28,080 --> 04:55:32,360
right through manifestation you actually

5565
04:55:29,920 --> 04:55:34,160
created it it's not just you're the

5566
04:55:32,360 --> 04:55:36,718
reason you're at fault and you're the

5567
04:55:34,160 --> 04:55:41,718
reason why you're sick you you made it

5568
04:55:36,718 --> 04:55:43,638
happen how about that one right there

5569
04:55:41,718 --> 04:55:46,840
I mean if that's not dark I don't know

5570
04:55:43,638 --> 04:55:48,760
what is what is in dark cuz that's not

5571
04:55:46,840 --> 04:55:50,680
the truth that's not the truth it's

5572
04:55:48,760 --> 04:55:52,360
Death By A Thousand Cuts out there there

5573
04:55:50,680 --> 04:55:54,280
lots of exposures there's lots of things

5574
04:55:52,360 --> 04:55:55,798
that make us sick and then the scale

5575
04:55:54,280 --> 04:55:58,600
gets tipped you guys know this

5576
04:55:55,798 --> 04:56:02,120
information right probably know it

5577
04:55:58,600 --> 04:56:02,120
better than I do at this point

5578
04:56:05,480 --> 04:56:10,840
right but you guys found freedom is what

5579
04:56:08,718 --> 04:56:12,520
you did even if you're still in your

5580
04:56:10,840 --> 04:56:14,558
healing process right now so I want to

5581
04:56:12,520 --> 04:56:18,400
take it to that level right

5582
04:56:14,558 --> 04:56:21,718
there healing works in mysterious ways

5583
04:56:18,400 --> 04:56:23,840
one way is the nervous system needs time

5584
04:56:21,718 --> 04:56:26,160
to heal after you've already healed

5585
04:56:23,840 --> 04:56:29,920
there's people that have already healed

5586
04:56:26,160 --> 04:56:32,240
they're healed they fixed their problem

5587
04:56:29,920 --> 04:56:34,600
they did they still have residuals they

5588
04:56:32,240 --> 04:56:36,920
still have their nerves that are need

5589
04:56:34,600 --> 04:56:39,040
time to heal that's always last it's

5590
04:56:36,920 --> 04:56:41,400
always last but it takes your free will

5591
04:56:39,040 --> 04:56:43,360
to just understand that and soak that up

5592
04:56:41,400 --> 04:56:45,920
a little bit and be like okay

5593
04:56:43,360 --> 04:56:48,120
okay it's not my fault I didn't create

5594
04:56:45,920 --> 04:56:50,160
it my nerves just need more time to heal

5595
04:56:48,120 --> 04:56:52,958
that's important to know all on its

5596
04:56:50,160 --> 04:56:55,760
own I think the one thing about us

5597
04:56:52,958 --> 04:56:57,600
thinking that we're the cause of our

5598
04:56:55,760 --> 04:57:01,040
sickness and illness and we manifested

5599
04:56:57,600 --> 04:57:04,240
it I think that brings you to a place of

5600
04:57:01,040 --> 04:57:05,760
hopelessness because you must be a bad

5601
04:57:04,240 --> 04:57:08,280
person if you're the reason why you're

5602
04:57:05,760 --> 04:57:11,120
sick and you caused

5603
04:57:08,280 --> 04:57:13,558
it truth is it's the opposite with you

5604
04:57:11,120 --> 04:57:15,638
guys and people out there who are sick

5605
04:57:13,558 --> 04:57:17,000
or just got sick it's not your fault you

5606
04:57:15,638 --> 04:57:20,080
didn't cause

5607
04:57:17,000 --> 04:57:22,120
it your body loves you unconditionally

5608
04:57:20,080 --> 04:57:23,160
you guys know the autoimmune Theory do

5609
04:57:22,120 --> 04:57:24,360
you guys remember that one the

5610
04:57:23,160 --> 04:57:27,040
autoimmune

5611
04:57:24,360 --> 04:57:29,040
Theory right your body's attacking

5612
04:57:27,040 --> 04:57:32,480
itself oh

5613
04:57:29,040 --> 04:57:35,798
no that's your immune system attacking

5614
04:57:32,480 --> 04:57:37,718
its glands attacking its organs that's

5615
04:57:35,798 --> 04:57:40,638
why you're sick it's your immune system

5616
04:57:37,718 --> 04:57:42,480
right attacking you it's another trap

5617
04:57:40,638 --> 04:57:44,958
out there and that's what I mean by

5618
04:57:42,480 --> 04:57:47,600
Freedom medical medium information is

5619
04:57:44,958 --> 04:57:49,798
true freedom because you learn and once

5620
04:57:47,600 --> 04:57:52,400
you learn hey my immune system didn't

5621
04:57:49,798 --> 04:57:55,798
attack my organs it didn't attack my

5622
04:57:52,400 --> 04:57:58,120
glands it's not attacking me but science

5623
04:57:55,798 --> 04:57:59,798
must know it truly must know they can't

5624
04:57:58,120 --> 04:58:02,240
be wrong all those smart people out

5625
04:57:59,798 --> 04:58:03,878
there in the world but they are wrong it

5626
04:58:02,240 --> 04:58:06,160
was a theory in the

5627
04:58:03,878 --> 04:58:07,000
1950s you know how it works you know how

5628
04:58:06,160 --> 04:58:09,878
it

5629
04:58:07,000 --> 04:58:13,878
rolls back to Freedom again you know the

5630
04:58:09,878 --> 04:58:16,798
ditch the fish oil tablets and capsules

5631
04:58:13,878 --> 04:58:18,760
or whatever you know to ditch the bad

5632
04:58:16,798 --> 04:58:21,600
stuff I'm just using that as one is one

5633
04:58:18,760 --> 04:58:24,480
example you know it's not Protein that's

5634
04:58:21,600 --> 04:58:26,000
not why you were sick you guys know that

5635
04:58:24,480 --> 04:58:28,798
you know your body's not attacking

5636
04:58:26,000 --> 04:58:30,958
itself you know that you know you didn't

5637
04:58:28,798 --> 04:58:32,760
create it or manifest it right you know

5638
04:58:30,958 --> 04:58:35,520
that you see all the traps I'm running

5639
04:58:32,760 --> 04:58:40,160
through them one trap after another one

5640
04:58:35,520 --> 04:58:42,120
one trap after another that's right

5641
04:58:40,160 --> 04:58:43,718
but don't worry some 22-year-old who's

5642
04:58:42,120 --> 04:58:47,280
never been sick

5643
04:58:43,718 --> 04:58:50,760
yet un social doing weights building

5644
04:58:47,280 --> 04:58:50,760
their muscles they know

5645
04:58:51,680 --> 04:58:54,280
everything till they're sick when

5646
04:58:53,440 --> 04:58:57,120
they're

5647
04:58:54,280 --> 04:58:59,920
39 and then they're like crap I I should

5648
04:58:57,120 --> 04:59:02,360
have read those medical medium

5649
04:58:59,920 --> 04:59:05,520
books and guess what those books will be

5650
04:59:02,360 --> 04:59:08,200
here they'll be here in 20 years be here

5651
04:59:05,520 --> 04:59:10,718
in 30 years they'll be here in 40 years

5652
04:59:08,200 --> 04:59:13,558
and there'll be a legacy

5653
04:59:10,718 --> 04:59:13,558
to save

5654
04:59:19,480 --> 04:59:24,760
lives I don't want you guys to feel like

5655
04:59:21,718 --> 04:59:26,638
you're super alone or anything I know

believe in God anybody believe in God in

5743
05:03:05,200 --> 05:03:08,200
here

5744
05:03:11,120 --> 05:03:15,840
medical medium book one was a little

5745
05:03:14,240 --> 05:03:17,520
difficult because I was putting God in

5746
05:03:15,840 --> 05:03:21,958
there every minute you

5747
05:03:17,520 --> 05:03:24,480
know I was I think back

5748
05:03:21,958 --> 05:03:26,400
then unless you were a

5749
05:03:24,480 --> 05:03:29,000
minister of

5750
05:03:26,400 --> 05:03:32,240
Faith right or a

5751
05:03:29,000 --> 05:03:34,680
priest or somebody you can use that word

5752
05:03:32,240 --> 05:03:36,600
God I don't know if you remember a

5753
05:03:34,680 --> 05:03:38,080
decade ago kind of well you weren't

5754
05:03:36,600 --> 05:03:40,878
allowed to use God too much you know

5755
05:03:38,080 --> 05:03:42,400
that right

5756
05:03:40,878 --> 05:03:44,440
and I was putting God all through the

5757
05:03:42,400 --> 05:03:45,920
medical medium book one wait a minute

5758
05:03:44,440 --> 05:03:48,000
though he's a medium why is he saying

5759
05:03:45,920 --> 05:03:49,878
God because it says in the Bible thou

5760
05:03:48,000 --> 05:03:51,840
who listens to some kind of voice in the

5761
05:03:49,878 --> 05:03:56,638
air or whatever who practices with the

5762
05:03:51,840 --> 05:03:56,638
crystal ball is damned to hell

5763
05:03:57,320 --> 05:04:00,878
right it's a funny

5764
05:04:01,680 --> 05:04:06,558
one you know when you hear a

5765
05:04:07,520 --> 05:04:14,240
voice that just wants people people to

5766
05:04:10,840 --> 05:04:18,840
heal and gives them tools to

5767
05:04:14,240 --> 05:04:18,840
heal I don't know anything closer to

5768
05:04:18,860 --> 05:04:30,320

5798
05:05:33,000 --> 05:05:42,040
thing people being sick and struggling

but you look fine right you look fine I

5800
05:05:42,040 --> 05:05:45,400
you know what I'm I'm glad that was

5801
05:05:43,480 --> 05:05:47,040
taken from medical medium there's some

5802
05:05:45,400 --> 05:05:49,040
things that are poached that I'm happy

5803
05:05:47,040 --> 05:05:51,520
about some things I'm poached that are

5804
05:05:49,040 --> 05:05:53,718
poached that I'm not happy about right

5805
05:05:51,520 --> 05:05:55,718
but when that was poached about the fact

5806
05:05:53,718 --> 05:05:57,480
that you can't see the illness but you

5807
05:05:55,718 --> 05:05:59,798
walk around with it and you suffer with

5808
05:05:57,480 --> 05:06:01,718
it with every single symptom but people

5809
05:05:59,798 --> 05:06:03,600
say you look fine there's nothing wrong

5810
05:06:01,718 --> 05:06:05,440
with you what are you talking about it

5811
05:06:03,600 --> 05:06:07,840
must be in your head you must be lazy or

5812
05:06:05,440 --> 05:06:09,718
bored something's just up with you you

5813
05:06:07,840 --> 05:06:13,200
got to see a psychiatrist maybe a

5814
05:06:09,718 --> 05:06:17,320
therapist you got a fear of

5815
05:06:13,200 --> 05:06:20,000
healing right but that invisible

5816
05:06:17,320 --> 05:06:21,440
illness that you can't see I didn't mind

5817
05:06:20,000 --> 05:06:22,958
when that was poached because you know

5818
05:06:21,440 --> 05:06:24,120
what it's doing a lot of people a lot of

5819
05:06:22,958 --> 05:06:25,798
good out there even if they don't know

5820
05:06:24,120 --> 05:06:27,760
medical medium

5821
05:06:25,798 --> 05:06:29,480
information but there's some things that

5822
05:06:27,760 --> 05:06:32,080
get poach it's sad because if they don't

5823
05:06:29,480 --> 05:06:34,280
know their way back to where it starts

5824
05:06:32,080 --> 05:06:36,520
they can't really get the rest of what

5825
05:06:34,280 --> 05:06:38,320
they need how many of you guys run into

5826
05:06:36,520 --> 05:06:40,878

05:16:37,760 --> 05:16:40,550
guys love you

6036
05:16:39,600 --> 05:16:48,878
all

6037
05:16:40,550 --> 05:16:52,320
[Applause]

6038
05:16:48,878 --> 05:16:54,680
right I recognized the medical medium I

6039
05:16:52,320 --> 05:16:56,760
had read like a little blog about him

6040
05:16:54,680 --> 05:16:58,920
and yeah just like a little seed was

6041
05:16:56,760 --> 05:17:00,600
planted I started listening and then a

6042
05:16:58,920 --> 05:17:03,400
couple years later is when I started

6043
05:17:00,600 --> 05:17:05,120
using his tools because I got desperate

6044
05:17:03,400 --> 05:17:07,920
with my symptoms I struggled with

6045
05:17:05,120 --> 05:17:10,638
chronic UTI for about 20 years and I was

6046
05:17:07,920 --> 05:17:12,600
on antibiotic every month sometimes

6047
05:17:10,638 --> 05:17:14,878
every week I probably took hundreds of

6048
05:17:12,600 --> 05:17:17,360
rounds of antibiotics throughout those

6049
05:17:14,878 --> 05:17:18,920
15 to 20 years and it wasn't until I

6050
05:17:17,360 --> 05:17:21,638
found his information that I was able to

6051
05:17:18,920 --> 05:17:24,440
clear those on my own and I've been UTI

6052
05:17:21,638 --> 05:17:26,760
free for probably 3 or 4 years and

6053
05:17:24,440 --> 05:17:29,600
antibiotic free for 5 years but I just

6054
05:17:26,760 --> 05:17:32,240
wanted to meet Anthony and thank him for

6055
05:17:29,600 --> 05:17:33,878
just giving me a new life really when I

6056
05:17:32,240 --> 05:17:36,958
was pregnant with my son I started to

6057
05:17:33,878 --> 05:17:39,360
feel these symptoms with like difficulty

6058
05:17:36,958 --> 05:17:41,320
digesting I pretty much couldn't eat

6059
05:17:39,360 --> 05:17:43,798
anything it just kept getting worse and

6060
05:17:41,320 --> 05:17:46,958
worse and my symptoms were out of

6061
05:17:43,798 --> 05:17:48,958
control and I you know went to all the

6062
05:17:46,958 --> 05:17:50,840
doctors and naturopaths and nobody

6063
05:17:48,958 --> 05:17:53,600
really had an answer and I was really

6064
05:17:50,840 --> 05:17:56,878
desperate one time I went to a bookstore

6065
05:17:53,600 --> 05:17:58,760
I saw his book his first book and I was

6066
05:17:56,878 --> 05:18:00,920
curious about it I read a little bit and

6067
05:17:58,760 --> 05:18:03,718
I was like I'm not sure so I just kind

6068
05:18:00,920 --> 05:18:06,798
of put it back a few weeks later through

6069
05:18:03,718 --> 05:18:08,840
a friend I was telling her you know that

6070
05:18:06,798 --> 05:18:12,000
I'm feeling these symptoms I can't eat

6071
05:18:08,840 --> 05:18:13,760
anything I felt like I was slowly dying

6072
05:18:12,000 --> 05:18:16,280
and she said you should check out

6073
05:18:13,760 --> 05:18:18,160
medical medium and I was like what I

6074
05:18:16,280 --> 05:18:20,958
just saw his book and she's like yeah

6075
05:18:18,160 --> 05:18:22,600
you should read it and I did and I mean

6076
05:18:20,958 --> 05:18:23,798
everything changed for me after that

6077
05:18:22,600 --> 05:18:26,878
everything I mean the fact that I can

6078
05:18:23,798 --> 05:18:29,120
come here and eat eat this food and

6079
05:18:26,878 --> 05:18:31,320
whereas before it was impossible

6080
05:18:29,120 --> 05:18:35,440
impossible so that's kind of what drew

6081
05:18:31,320 --> 05:18:39,400
me and I'm so grateful I would say I

6082
05:18:35,440 --> 05:18:41,760
am such a stronger mother

6083
05:18:39,400 --> 05:18:43,920
I just asked my 14-year-old son I said

6084
05:18:41,760 --> 05:18:45,600
when was last time you were sick and it

6085
05:18:43,920 --> 05:18:48,120
was just a long

6086
05:18:45,600 --> 05:18:52,120
pause we realized it was over 2 years

6087
05:18:48,120 --> 05:18:55,000
ago before learning mm I never knew

6088
05:18:52,120 --> 05:18:57,760
which supplement to buy I didn't know

6089
05:18:55,000 --> 05:19:01,120
what to stay away from I didn't know how

6090
05:18:57,760 --> 05:19:03,440
much to give a child that is

6091
05:19:01,120 --> 05:19:05,600
huge so I would say you know do I give

6092
05:19:03,440 --> 05:19:08,000
him 1,5 what's too much am I going to

6093
05:19:05,600 --> 05:19:09,440
hurt him you know so now I know I have

6094
05:19:08,000 --> 05:19:10,558
the power

6095
05:19:09,440 --> 05:19:12,958
I've been using medical medium

6096
05:19:10,558 --> 05:19:15,400
information for 8 years and I started

6097
05:19:12,958 --> 05:19:17,878
off kind of slow and needed to build my

6098
05:19:15,400 --> 05:19:20,680
trust with the information and the new

6099
05:19:17,878 --> 05:19:22,798
mentality of how to eat and heal but

6100
05:19:20,680 --> 05:19:24,958
just step by step I slowly implemented

6101
05:19:22,798 --> 05:19:28,240
one item at a time pretty much every two

6102
05:19:24,958 --> 05:19:30,200
weeks and each time it blew me away so I

6103
05:19:28,240 --> 05:19:34,200
kept going and it would took me about 3

6104
05:19:30,200 --> 05:19:38,080
years to fully dive in my biggest change

6105
05:19:34,200 --> 05:19:41,798
I would say was healing dyslexia add um

6106
05:19:38,080 --> 05:19:44,760
depression anxiety OCD thoughts and it

6107
05:19:41,798 --> 05:19:47,440
still took me maybe a year to really get

6108
05:19:44,760 --> 05:19:49,920
out of that but once I did it was like a

6109
05:19:47,440 --> 05:19:52,200
breath of fresh air to lead a normal

6110
05:19:49,920 --> 05:19:53,760
life to have new opportunities to feel

6111
05:19:52,200 --> 05:19:56,558
confident and you know feel like

6112
05:19:53,760 --> 05:19:59,450
yourself again so I yeah I was lucky

6113
05:19:56,558 --> 05:20:02,540
that I found this information and

6114
05:19:59,450 --> 05:20:02,540
[Music]

6115
05:20:04,718 --> 05:20:10,080
healed I was diagnosed with hypothyroid

6116
05:20:07,798 --> 05:20:11,920
about 4 years later I kind of I found

6117
05:20:10,080 --> 05:20:14,080
medical medium's advice and I said

6118
05:20:11,920 --> 05:20:16,320
finally there's an answer of why because

6119
05:20:14,080 --> 05:20:19,000
I've always said why why do I get this

6120
05:20:16,320 --> 05:20:21,160
why do you have this what's this and

6121
05:20:19,000 --> 05:20:22,400
there's a reason and he gives a reason

6122
05:20:21,160 --> 05:20:25,040
and that's kind of what I was always

6123
05:20:22,400 --> 05:20:28,600
looking for so Through The Years just I

6124
05:20:25,040 --> 05:20:31,440
would say um having energy being alive

6125
05:20:28,600 --> 05:20:34,200
not on at my age any medication I'm

6126
05:20:31,440 --> 05:20:36,638
super thrilled about that and never want

6127
05:20:34,200 --> 05:20:38,360
to be and I just believe the body

6128
05:20:36,638 --> 05:20:40,680
naturally does want to heal if you give

6129
05:20:38,360 --> 05:20:43,440
it the the right things well I was

6130
05:20:40,680 --> 05:20:45,520
diagnosed with Graves sometime last year

6131
05:20:43,440 --> 05:20:48,040
and after being on medical median for

6132
05:20:45,520 --> 05:20:50,080
like 6 months my doctor finally told me

6133
05:20:48,040 --> 05:20:53,040
that I'm in remission when we got the

6134
05:20:50,080 --> 05:20:54,520
news last year was like spring uh it hit

6135
05:20:53,040 --> 05:20:56,440
her really hard it's just like you have

6136
05:20:54,520 --> 05:20:58,798
to be on medicine your whole life or

6137
05:20:56,440 --> 05:21:01,440
remove your thyroid ready she wasn't

6138
05:20:58,798 --> 05:21:02,920
having it she was searching for answers

6139
05:21:01,440 --> 05:21:04,840
and then eventually came across

6140
05:21:02,920 --> 05:21:06,958
Anthony's book beforehand she tried

6141
05:21:04,840 --> 05:21:08,638
going off the medicine symptoms came

6142
05:21:06,958 --> 05:21:10,000
back like within a couple weeks and we

6143
05:21:08,638 --> 05:21:11,360
were both kind of disappointed cuz it

6144
05:21:10,000 --> 05:21:13,440
was doing well when she was on the

6145
05:21:11,360 --> 05:21:15,920
medicine and then the summer she took

6146
05:21:13,440 --> 05:21:17,840
herself off and like you know nothing

6147
05:21:15,920 --> 05:21:20,400
really changed too much and she just

6148
05:21:17,840 --> 05:21:22,200
kept with the diet and then yeah went to

6149
05:21:20,400 --> 05:21:24,080
the the doctor and they told her that it

6150
05:21:22,200 --> 05:21:26,840
was in remission did blood work and all

6151
05:21:24,080 --> 05:21:28,320
of that and I was thrilled naturally I

6152
05:21:26,840 --> 05:21:31,320
just wanted her to be happy and she is

6153
05:21:28,320 --> 05:21:32,440
she's happy and healthy I would say what

6154
05:21:31,320 --> 05:21:35,440
predominantly brought me to the

6155
05:21:32,440 --> 05:21:38,080
information was I had really bad mental

6156
05:21:35,440 --> 05:21:39,080
health struggles very severe depression

6157
05:21:38,080 --> 05:21:41,718
to where

6158
05:21:39,080 --> 05:21:44,520
I'd wake up and I couldn't pinpoint why

6159
05:21:41,718 --> 05:21:47,360
I felt that way but I was just so low

6160
05:21:44,520 --> 05:21:50,160
and for most of my life I struggled with

6161
05:21:47,360 --> 05:21:52,920
depression and anxiety um among other

6162
05:21:50,160 --> 05:21:55,440
struggles and it's symptoms I've made

6163
05:21:52,920 --> 05:21:57,160
like a lot of traction with I feel

6164
05:21:55,440 --> 05:21:59,480
amazing that I'm able to cope with

6165
05:21:57,160 --> 05:22:02,360
things in a lot more resilient of a way

6166
05:21:59,480 --> 05:22:04,360
so it feels very freeing I came about

6167
05:22:02,360 --> 05:22:07,798
the information to help my patients and

6168
05:22:04,360 --> 05:22:11,000
family I think that as doctors we can

6169
05:22:07,798 --> 05:22:12,600
see what we are actually doing to

6170
05:22:11,000 --> 05:22:14,558
patients because a lot of patients are

6171
05:22:12,600 --> 05:22:16,200
suffering some side effects and when

6172
05:22:14,558 --> 05:22:18,718
they come back we put them on more

6173
05:22:16,200 --> 05:22:19,920
medications to help with the side

6174
05:22:18,718 --> 05:22:22,680
effects and they end up with more and

6175
05:22:19,920 --> 05:22:25,840
more medications and the procedures we

6176
05:22:22,680 --> 05:22:28,200
see a lot of um negative effect from

6177
05:22:25,840 --> 05:22:30,280
procedures that we perform really

6178
05:22:28,200 --> 05:22:32,638
witnessing that should alert us are we

6179
05:22:30,280 --> 05:22:34,798
really helping patients with those

6180
05:22:32,638 --> 05:22:37,480
things that we do to

6181
05:22:34,798 --> 05:22:40,280
them wow what a great lecture and that

6182
05:22:37,480 --> 05:22:43,000

of like hope recovery things they've

6213
05:23:51,680 --> 05:23:57,360
been through and you feel a sense of

6214
05:23:53,798 --> 05:23:59,760
community and um how food can heal you

6215
05:23:57,360 --> 05:24:01,400
it's like gosh I wish there were more

6216
05:23:59,760 --> 05:24:03,920
moments like this in life but it feels

6217
05:24:01,400 --> 05:24:05,958
really special and lovely how was your

6218
05:24:03,920 --> 05:24:09,480
experience like with tonight's life

6219
05:24:05,958 --> 05:24:10,840
blast it was amazing I felt it

6220
05:24:09,480 --> 05:24:13,400
immediately I actually had like a

6221
05:24:10,840 --> 05:24:15,798
toothache and it's kind of gone um and

6222
05:24:13,400 --> 05:24:18,440
we were actually holding hands she like

6223
05:24:15,798 --> 05:24:20,360
I'm more ingratiated into medical medium

6224
05:24:18,440 --> 05:24:22,200
she's a little bit like slowly getting

6225
05:24:20,360 --> 05:24:24,120
into it so I made her hold my hand

6226
05:24:22,200 --> 05:24:26,440
because I was like you you know got to

6227
05:24:24,120 --> 05:24:28,920
send that energy to her but I don't know

6228
05:24:26,440 --> 05:24:30,638
it was great I loved it what did you

6229
05:24:28,920 --> 05:24:33,360
feel during that Li Bloss well I you

6230
05:24:30,638 --> 05:24:36,160
know like I'm I am not that spiritual of

6231
05:24:33,360 --> 05:24:38,400
a person but I felt like this is really

6232
05:24:36,160 --> 05:24:40,320
fun and quirky and different and maybe

6233
05:24:38,400 --> 05:24:42,558
you know like I don't know there's

6234
05:24:40,320 --> 05:24:44,160
there's positive energy and I feel that

6235
05:24:42,558 --> 05:24:46,558
Virgo is going to be gone now and then

6236
05:24:44,160 --> 05:24:48,520
yeah maybe I'll change my mind yeah when

6237
05:24:46,558 --> 05:24:51,200
I'm like reverse aging I'll I'll change

6238
05:24:48,520 --> 05:24:53,000
my mind on it and what is it about the

6239
05:24:51,200 --> 05:24:55,798
medical medium protocol that You' first

6240
05:24:53,000 --> 05:24:58,320
started now and what what are some of

6241
05:24:55,798 --> 05:25:00,080
your favorite uh you know smoothies

6242
05:24:58,320 --> 05:25:02,760
juices and what health benefits have you

6243
05:25:00,080 --> 05:25:04,958
found so I've been dealing with ver for

6244
05:25:02,760 --> 05:25:06,760
the past 6 months and I had I quit

6245
05:25:04,958 --> 05:25:09,200
caffeine I've taken a lot of cues from

6246
05:25:06,760 --> 05:25:11,558
Lauren um the C juice in the morning is

6247
05:25:09,200 --> 05:25:13,878
so important the heavy metal detex

6248
05:25:11,558 --> 05:25:16,120
smoothie and I'm not always perfect but

6249
05:25:13,878 --> 05:25:18,280
for me it's like ginger is great for

6250
05:25:16,120 --> 05:25:20,760
inflammation there's certain elements

6251
05:25:18,280 --> 05:25:23,320
that I you know Ginger and turmeric and

6252
05:25:20,760 --> 05:25:26,080
spirulina and it's like adding these

6253
05:25:23,320 --> 05:25:28,360
things in and slowly over time taking

6254
05:25:26,080 --> 05:25:30,638
things out and I like that Anthony talks

6255
05:25:28,360 --> 05:25:33,280
about maybe you just change one thing

6256
05:25:30,638 --> 05:25:35,160
that that's me I'm not you know Lauren

6257
05:25:33,280 --> 05:25:37,718
has has gotten to the point where she

6258
05:25:35,160 --> 05:25:39,920
can live a really clean protocol I'm

6259
05:25:37,718 --> 05:25:42,638
just doing it step by step but I see

6260
05:25:39,920 --> 05:25:45,680
enough Improvement in how I feel and my

6261
05:25:42,638 --> 05:25:48,480
energy to keep going and I hope to just

6262
05:25:45,680 --> 05:25:50,040
keep getting better at it what a

6263
05:25:48,480 --> 05:25:51,958
beautiful way to do the protocol

6264
05:25:50,040 --> 05:25:54,798
together is it inspiring watching each

6265
05:25:51,958 --> 05:25:57,080
other heal it's so inspiring she

6266
05:25:54,798 --> 05:25:58,840
inspires me every day we Inspire each

6267
05:25:57,080 --> 05:26:00,958
other it's it's

6268
05:25:58,840 --> 05:26:02,840
great do you ever get in the kitchen

6269
05:26:00,958 --> 05:26:04,360
together and make some of the recipes oh

6270
05:26:02,840 --> 05:26:06,558
yeah she's a better cook than me

6271
05:26:04,360 --> 05:26:08,600
actually like I mean I've done it so

6272
05:26:06,558 --> 05:26:10,240
long I'm a grizzled vet like I do the

6273
05:26:08,600 --> 05:26:12,360
same things over and over she'll like

6274
05:26:10,240 --> 05:26:14,600
get creative I'm like oh man this tastes

6275
05:26:12,360 --> 05:26:16,120
good but she is like very strict I'll be

6276
05:26:14,600 --> 05:26:19,760
like do you want to put like a Parmesan

6277
05:26:16,120 --> 05:26:22,558
R and she's like so she's like very

6278
05:26:19,760 --> 05:26:24,958
medical medium seasoned but um I'm

6279
05:26:22,558 --> 05:26:26,840
better for it so she's a good influence

6280
05:26:24,958 --> 05:26:28,878
yeah she's doing it out of love yeah

6281
05:26:26,840 --> 05:26:31,360
absolutely what did you think of the

6282
05:26:28,878 --> 05:26:32,958
food tonight what was your favorite dish

6283
05:26:31,360 --> 05:26:35,400
um the pizza was incredible I haven't

6284
05:26:32,958 --> 05:26:37,878
had pizza in so long and the

6285
05:26:35,400 --> 05:26:41,360
Mediterranean pizza sorry I ate both

6286
05:26:37,878 --> 05:26:43,360
Pizza is but it was so good it just like

6287
05:26:41,360 --> 05:26:44,600
had it was analogous to pepperoni in an

6288
05:26:43,360 --> 05:26:47,440
interesting way and I thought it was

6289
05:26:44,600 --> 05:26:49,600
really good well I loved all the food

6290
05:26:47,440 --> 05:26:52,440
but for me you know Lauren's been doing

6291
05:26:49,600 --> 05:26:53,878
this for 9 years uh this is the first

6292
05:26:52,440 --> 05:26:55,520
time in 9 years where I've gotten to go

6293
05:26:53,878 --> 05:26:58,440
out to eat with Lauren and she hasn't

6294
05:26:55,520 --> 05:27:00,360
had to bring her own food that means the

6295
05:26:58,440 --> 05:27:02,000
world to see my sister sit down and eat

6296
05:27:00,360 --> 05:27:05,320
a full meal and be taken care of and not

6297
05:27:02,000 --> 05:27:07,320
be judged um so to me the food's

6298
05:27:05,320 --> 05:27:08,840
excellent but it's also someone created

6299
05:27:07,320 --> 05:27:11,080
this environment where you can feel

6300
05:27:08,840 --> 05:27:14,160
included and

6301
05:27:11,080 --> 05:27:16,280
seen it makes me emotional but it's

6302
05:27:14,160 --> 05:27:19,000
beautiful she deserves that all the time

6303
05:27:16,280 --> 05:27:20,920
but to get it like this is so special

6304
05:27:19,000 --> 05:27:22,840
yeah so special do you enjoy hanging out

6305
05:27:20,920 --> 05:27:24,840
with the medical maum community in this

6306
05:27:22,840 --> 05:27:26,798
environment like like your sister saying

6307
05:27:24,840 --> 05:27:28,798
it's a beautiful environment everybody

6308
05:27:26,798 --> 05:27:30,000
understands one another there's a quiet

6309
05:27:28,798 --> 05:27:32,280
understanding you don't even have to

6310
05:27:30,000 --> 05:27:34,558
really explain yourself to someone and

6311
05:27:32,280 --> 05:27:36,680
we all look fine but we've all been

6312
05:27:34,558 --> 05:27:39,798
through a lot and it's just a beautiful

6313
05:27:36,680 --> 05:27:42,360
thing to share no we spoke to someone

6314
05:27:39,798 --> 05:27:44,320
who she was like my goal was to just

6315
05:27:42,360 --> 05:27:45,798
walk at my friend's wedding and she got

6316
05:27:44,320 --> 05:27:48,160
to do that and I think like when you

6317
05:27:45,798 --> 05:27:50,958
think of Cafe Gratitude it's like that's

6318
05:27:48,160 --> 05:27:52,760
it it's gratitude like you get gratitude

6319
05:27:50,958 --> 05:27:54,558
for the smallest thing that we take for

6320
05:27:52,760 --> 05:27:56,718
granted in life to walk at your friend's

6321
05:27:54,558 --> 05:27:58,520
wedding to see your sister eat a meal

6322
05:27:56,718 --> 05:28:01,360
that she couldn't eat that's so

6323
05:27:58,520 --> 05:28:03,240
beautiful and Powerful yeah are you

6324
05:28:01,360 --> 05:28:06,360
excited for Cafe Gratitude to continue

6325
05:28:03,240 --> 05:28:08,280
offering these dishes on the menu yeah

6326
05:28:06,360 --> 05:28:10,200
because if we can build more more

6327
05:28:08,280 --> 05:28:12,040
communities like this people can heal

6328
05:28:10,200 --> 05:28:14,440
and I'm not saying it's for everybody

6329
05:28:12,040 --> 05:28:15,798
but there should be a space for all the

6330
05:28:14,440 --> 05:28:18,878
people who want to heal or aren't

6331
05:28:15,798 --> 05:28:20,680
getting answers and want to empower

6332
05:28:18,878 --> 05:28:22,320
themselves you know there's there's

6333
05:28:20,680 --> 05:28:24,480
things that your doctor can tell you but

6334
05:28:22,320 --> 05:28:26,840
if you if you want to believe you can

6335
05:28:24,480 --> 05:28:29,840
heal yourself this is how you start with

6336
05:28:26,840 --> 05:28:32,520
how you eat and we need more places like

6337
05:28:29,840 --> 05:28:33,840
this for sure and finally do you have an

6338
05:28:32,520 --> 05:28:36,360
encouraging message you'd like to share

6339
05:28:33,840 --> 05:28:37,840
with the community watching tonight I

6340
05:28:36,360 --> 05:28:40,520
would say just start small wherever

6341
05:28:37,840 --> 05:28:42,840
you're at every day sometimes it's just

6342
05:28:40,520 --> 05:28:45,680
one little thing go through one minute 1

6343
05:28:42,840 --> 05:28:47,840
second one hour I know everyone's going

6344
05:28:45,680 --> 05:28:50,120
through tough things we get setbacks

6345
05:28:47,840 --> 05:28:52,600
just keep going there's light at the end

6346
05:28:50,120 --> 05:28:54,520
of the tunnel There's Hope yeah and if

6347
05:28:52,600 --> 05:28:57,040
you don't believe in this stuff just

6348
05:28:54,520 --> 05:28:59,080
talk to one person who's experienced it

6349
05:28:57,040 --> 05:29:00,680
because you know Lauren gets a message

6350
05:28:59,080 --> 05:29:02,958
from people all the time who are looking

6351
05:29:00,680 --> 05:29:04,280

Journey with medical medium

6444

information um sure um I was on mattress

6445
05:33:04,280 --> 05:33:09,240
Island about 13 well I started 14 years

6446
05:33:07,040 --> 05:33:13,920
ago I had a bad Hemorrhage so that put

6447
05:33:09,240 --> 05:33:15,638
me in UN in a bad place and so I don't

6448
05:33:13,920 --> 05:33:17,718
know how long after that it's kind of a

6449
05:33:15,638 --> 05:33:19,680
blur how long it took to find medical

6450
05:33:17,718 --> 05:33:23,240
medium but he was an answer to my

6451
05:33:19,680 --> 05:33:25,798
prayers and I just started slowly and

6452
05:33:23,240 --> 05:33:27,638
here I am wow so you say you started

6453
05:33:25,798 --> 05:33:30,120
slowly what things did you first bring

6454
05:33:27,638 --> 05:33:31,400
into to your with the medical medium

6455
05:33:30,120 --> 05:33:34,600
information to start your healing

6456
05:33:31,400 --> 05:33:36,558
journey I cut out the no foods and I did

6457
05:33:34,600 --> 05:33:38,440
celery juice and then the heavy metal

6458
05:33:36,558 --> 05:33:41,638
detox smoothie was

6459
05:33:38,440 --> 05:33:43,400
just a little bit at a time MH yeah when

6460
05:33:41,638 --> 05:33:45,480

6461
05:33:43,400 --> 05:33:46,638

6462
05:33:45,480 --> 05:33:49,000
Journey

6463
05:33:46,638 --> 05:33:51,920
progressing oh I would say probably

6464
05:33:49,000 --> 05:33:54,638
pretty much right away um I was in such

6465
05:33:51,920 --> 05:33:56,920
a bad place though it took a while to

6466
05:33:54,638 --> 05:34:01,480
feel like I was functioning as a normal

6467
05:33:56,920 --> 05:34:03,600
person but um it was it was pretty

6468
05:34:01,480 --> 05:34:06,120

H gosh I had almost 40 symptoms so it's

6472
05:34:14,920 --> 05:34:18,878

debilitating and now if I have a little

6476
05:34:22,638 --> 05:34:27,680

keep the faith the first radio show I

6497
05:35:11,440 --> 05:35:17,040
listened to with Anthony was about faith

6498
05:35:14,760 --> 05:35:19,840
and yeah that turned it around for me

6499
05:35:17,040 --> 05:35:21,878
was just knowing that if you have faith

6500
05:35:19,840 --> 05:35:24,760
starts somewhere and every little bit

6501
05:35:21,878 --> 05:35:27,160
does matter so I want to ask you then

6502
05:35:24,760 --> 05:35:28,958
during your healing Journey did you

6503
05:35:27,160 --> 05:35:30,520

6504
05:35:28,958 --> 05:35:32,120

6505
05:35:30,520 --> 05:35:33,958

6507
05:35:33,958 --> 05:35:41,798

05:35:43,440 --> 05:35:50,638
um yeah a

6511
05:35:46,000 --> 05:35:53,040
lot yeah I it's hard to explain

6512
05:35:50,638 --> 05:35:54,840
incredible yeah yeah no it's okay words

6513
05:35:53,040 --> 05:35:57,760
to it it's just difficult it's just

6514
05:35:54,840 --> 05:35:58,920
something just you can't explain it it's

6515
05:35:57,760 --> 05:36:00,680
quite beautiful cuz a lot of people

05:36:16,360 --> 05:36:23,558
