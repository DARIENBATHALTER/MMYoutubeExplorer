organized hateful group that has been on

a Relentless pursuit to destroy the

5
00:00:09,559 --> 00:00:14,719
medical medium community and that has

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:17,480
been attacking bullying harassing and

7
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:20,320

practitioner who became a whistleblower

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,640
after she witnessed this hateful group

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,040
in action when they tried to recruit her

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:37,280
to join them last year Amber caught the

14
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:39,399
main members of this group on legally

15
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,879
recorded calls describing their

16
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:46,640
premeditated multi-step plan to create a

18
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:52,559
false stories and claims about me and

about medical medium information to

20
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:58,519
Major media outlets in hopes that it

21
00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:01,320
would lead to securing themselves a deal

22
00:00:58,519 --> 00:01:04,479
for an anti-ed medium documentary on

23
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:08,439
Netflix that would bring Fame and other

24
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:10,600
benefits to them now known infamously

25
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:13,840

26
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:17,000
was caught on recording and exposed we

27

including competitors in the health

industry to try to frame medical medium

37
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:49,000

illness back in 2020 Ashley posted her

original false story about Stephanie

84
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,519

the comments on something she had gotten

89
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:14,519
very wrong and Ashley had to adjust her

00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:16,840
false story because of it Kimberly made

91
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:19,400
a statement to her own small private

92
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:22,320
Community to calm fears and Chaos that

93
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:24,800
Ashley had created with her false story

94
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:27,120
Ashley was not happy about this and she

95
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:30,280
responded by attacking Kim and trying to

96
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,759
intimidate her to this day Ashley has

97
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:35,560
continued to publicly attack Kimberly

98
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:37,680
and her family Kimberly thank you for

99
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:39,400
coming on to share your story I know

100
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,759
that this situation has been extremely

101
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:44,720
upsetting thank you Amber this is a

102
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,720
really sad situation a dear friend that

103
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,720
I cared about is being used for an

104
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,160
agenda that seems to have been created

105
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,080
years after her passing I would have

106
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:55,560
never shared the intimate details of her

107
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:58,440
story because Stephanie's privacy is my

108
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:00,680
number one concern however the plotters

109
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:03,240
have shared very intimate details of

110
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:06,600
Stephanie's story and even delicate

111
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:08,840
unnecessary details about her life I was

112
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:12,080
recently attacked and have been

113
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:14,240
continually attacked since 2020 the

114
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:17,400
attacks were sudden they were out of the

115
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:19,800
blue I was actually really shocked when

116
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:22,039
they began I felt it was really

117
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,880
necessary for me to set a few things

118
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:27,720
straight here

119
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:30,120
today yeah could you start Kim by

120
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,919
telling us first about your relationship

121
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,560
with Stephanie and how you were

122
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:38,759
supporting her when she was

123
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:41,479
sick yeah so we met actually at Ashley's

124
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:44,039
home during the LA medical medium event

125
00:05:41,479 --> 00:05:46,199
Stephanie and I became instant friends

126
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:48,120
we realized that we lived just one state

127
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:50,960
over from each other and that she had a

128
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:54,400
nephew that was very close in age to my

129
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:57,759
son we started texting and voice texting

130
00:05:54,400 --> 00:06:00,240
a lot Stephanie was sweet she was funny

131
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:02,840
she was loving and she was always

132
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:05,520
looking for advice but she was also

133
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:08,080
always offering to help in any way that

134
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,080
she could I would meet up with Stephanie

135
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,720
for lunch at the grocery store juice

136
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:15,000
bars and I met up with her the night

137
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,360
that her niece was born at the hospital

138
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,080
to arm her with the things that she

139
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,960
wanted to support her sister-in-law

140
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,800
through

141
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,800
Labor a few months later I met her

142
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:26,240
sister-in-law niece and nephew for a

143
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,240
lunch date and we bounced together along

144
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,080
with her family and my family at her

145
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,880
nephew's birthday party

146
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:35,280
Stephanie was so so proud of her niece

147
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,720
and nephew and wanted me to be friends

148
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,919
with her sister-in-law because she

149
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,319
thought we had so much in common and we

150
00:06:38,919 --> 00:06:44,000
had kids that were really close in

151
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:46,639
age I adored Stephanie and the

152
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,039
friendship that we shared I soon became

153
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:51,280
pregnant with my second child and

154
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:53,919
Stephanie volunteered to help me

155
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,400
postpartum with my 2-year-old son the

156
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:57,759
same way that she supported her

157
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:59,879
sister-in-law and her nephew because she

158
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,680
told me I helped to support her and her

159
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:04,160
brother and her brother's family

160
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:07,919
postpartum and that I also needed that

161
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:10,360
same help she was always so gentle so

162
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:12,520
kind and always questioned how I was

163
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:14,960
working full-time how I was pregnant and

164
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:18,560
also caring for a two-year-old she got

165
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:21,720
it and it meant so much to

166
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,560
me when Stephanie got sick I remember

167
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,560
discussing doctors with her and offering

168
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:28,840
to go with her into the City and hold

169
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:32,400
her hand but Stephanie was not receptive

170
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:36,400
to the idea of seeing a doctor at that

171
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:37,960
time wow and then what was happening and

172
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,400
what were things like after Stephanie

173
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:42,759
got

174
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:45,680
sick so this was really hard when

175
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:48,400
Stephanie took a turn for the worst I

176
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,639
was getting ready to birth my baby I was

177
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,759
planning a vack birth as my first birth

178
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:55,319
was a traumatic emergency birth and the

179
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:58,479
stress of what I'm about to explain was

180
00:07:55,319 --> 00:08:01,759
impacting my ability to birth my baby I

181
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:03,520
was under so much pressure and I was

182
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,800
having such a hard time shifting into

183
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:08,479
birth mode as I was on constant group

184
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:10,280
messages with then friends colleagues

185
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:12,879
medical doctors consultants and

186
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:17,319
personally with Stephanie to support her

187
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:20,199
as best I could the pressure was never

188
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:23,479
ever from Stephanie it was coming from

189
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:25,840
several of the plotters mostly Ashley

190
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:28,000
who lived across the country they were

191
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,599
looking at a map and telling me that I

192
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,839
live an hour and 20 minutes from

193
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:34,080
Stephanie but in reality with City

194
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:37,880
traffic this often times could take up

195
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:39,640
to 4 hours each way this is why when

196
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:41,959
Stephanie and I did meet up before she

197
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:44,120
was sick we were always extremely

198
00:08:41,959 --> 00:08:45,880
strategic about our planning the city

199
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:48,320
traffic where we live is

200
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:51,160
horrendous and the driving around here

201
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:55,160
during the city traffic it's it's just

202
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:57,279
crazy so back to my birth I was

203
00:08:55,160 --> 00:09:00,320
literally in the birthing tub birthing

204
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:02,880
my baby on text threads with Stephanie

205
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,640
and with her supporters several of which

206
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,640
are now involved in trying to take this

207
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:10,399
community down when I finally birthed my

208
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:12,680
baby I was back on the text threads

209
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:15,040
within minutes planning how I could best

210
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:19,880
support Stephanie this was before my

211
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:19,880
family or my son had even met my new

212
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,839
daughter I was under so much pressure

213
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,040
before I was even cleared to drive by my

214
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:29,560
midwives I was back on my feet caring

215
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,160
for my newborn caring for my 2-year-old

216
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:33,760
and driving food and teas and

217
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:35,480
supplements that Stephanie wanted to her

218
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,640
whenever I

219
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:41,120
could Stephanie herself did not want me

220
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,839
doing this but the plotters continued to

221
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:46,120
push me like I was some type of robot

222
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:49,360
that should birth a baby and then be

223
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:51,680
back to running around I also opened up

224
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:56,560
my home to a house guest when I was only

225
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:58,360
a few weeks postpartum a friend Gretchen

226
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,880
she came to my house and stayed with me

227
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:02,519
so that she could support

228
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:05,640
Stephanie my husband and I gave up a car

229
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:07,240
we ran errands on no sleep we also

230
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:09,600
opened our home to

231
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:11,519
illness as greten was in and out of the

232
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,839
hospital and then back in our home

233
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:16,360
around my newborn we all came down with

234
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:19,000
a flu when my baby was just a few weeks

235
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:21,519
old my 2-year-old was also sick it was

236
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,519
one of the hardest experiences of my

237
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:26,600
life being postpartum having a baby

238
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:30,160
being exposed to a

239
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:33,079
flu on one trip to pick up Gretchen

240
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:36,279
again before I was cleared to drive I

241
00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:37,560
was so tired that I went to pump gas

242
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:40,600
near Stephanie's

243
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:44,680
home the gas station was old and the

244
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:47,440
pump was malfunctioning and I was

245
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:50,079
exhausted I grabbed the noble nozzle and

246
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:53,160
I pressed it a few times before it

247
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:56,959
turned on soaking me in gasoline my hair

248
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:59,839
was soaked my clothes were soaked I was

249
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:03,200
drenched from head to toe I was sprayed

250
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:06,399
in the eyes and I felt like I couldn't

251
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:09,320
breathe I was shaking from the freezing

252
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:12,399
temperatures my newborn she was in the

253
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:15,079
back seat breathing in all the

254
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:17,760
fumes I rushed to Stephanie's house with

255
00:11:15,079 --> 00:11:20,480
my windows down freezing

256
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,680
shaking and I had to shower and wear

257
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:26,079
someone else's clothes

258
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:27,720
home the whole time period it was

259
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:32,320
totally

260
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:34,839
insane I had a baby a baby a newborn

261
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:38,959
that was just a few weeks old and a

262
00:11:34,839 --> 00:11:41,440
2-year-old son and I was being pushed by

263
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:44,800
women across the country mostly Ashley

264
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,920
to do more and more I had already been

265
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,240
supporting Stephanie in every way that I

266
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:51,000
could I had given her money I had

267
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:52,800
purchased supplements that she wanted

268
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,600
and couldn't afford I was cooking her

269
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,800
meals when I could bringing her teas

270
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:58,519
when I could my husband even took food

271
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,320
to the hospital at one point just days

272
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:02,920
after my daughter was

273
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,680
born he felt extremely uncomfortable in

274
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,600
the hospital as Stephanie wanted to talk

275
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:08,839
to him and welcome the food but he felt

276
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:12,160
so mixed up in a situation where some of

277
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:15,480
the plotters were screaming at her

278
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:17,440
family one of the plotters Taylor was

279
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:19,240
attacking Stephanie's father having a

280
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,519
heated discussion while disagreeing with

281
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:24,320
Stephanie's father about her

282
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:26,240
treatment my husband during those days

283
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,160
was rushing home from work so that he or

284
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,160
I could run things we could move cars we

285
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,760
could run errands we can manage house

286
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:35,120
guests cook meals run guests back and

287
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:37,720
forth with a baby and a 2-year-old I

288
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:40,279
wanted to do everything for

289
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:42,199
Stephanie but Ashley was creating a

290
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:44,800
pressure on me that almost broke me

291
00:12:42,199 --> 00:12:44,800
during that

292
00:12:45,079 --> 00:12:51,120
time

293
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:53,880
wow there's so much to unpack here from

294
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:56,560
this story and it sounds like such an

295
00:12:53,880 --> 00:13:00,120
unbelievably stressful and traumatic

296
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:01,519
time having gasoline sprayed all over

297
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,240
your body like that when your body's

298
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:06,320
already compromised from having just

299
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:08,440
given birth let alone when you're

300
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:11,480
breastfeeding it's a

301
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:15,160
tremendous exposure I can't even imagine

302
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:17,240
I would have been devastated and despite

303
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:19,079
having just given birth you and your

304
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,800
husband were both doing the best that

305
00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:23,639
you could to help Stephanie while she

306
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:26,959
was sick you weren't cleared to even

307
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:30,040
drive yet and you did it anyway the

308
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:31,920
drive wasn't short I want to bring in a

309
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:34,639
text that we have from Stephanie she had

310
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:36,959
sent it to a friend this was from before

311
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,920
she had gotten sick and she was talking

312
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:42,079
about some items that she was thinking

313
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:44,600
about picking up from you and she says

314
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:46,959
okay cool she isn't super close so may

315
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:50,279
not get it unless it's super

316
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:52,399
important this text corroborates this

317
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:54,120
text from Stephanie corroborates the

318
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:56,360
fact that you were far enough away from

319
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:58,680
her that it would have been a hassle for

320
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:00,519
her to pick up items from your house if

321
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:02,720
they weren't super

322
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:04,639
important you said that your husband

323
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,360
brought food to the hospital and spent

324
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:09,480
time around the family you both were

325
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,560
actually there and you got to witness

326
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:15,560
what was going on in person when

327
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:17,399
Stephanie was sick as Ashley mainly was

328
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:21,399
putting all of this pressure on you to

329
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:23,600
do more and more I'm wondering where was

330
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:25,480
Ashley and what was Ashley doing during

331
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:28,519
the year and a half that Stephanie was

332
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:31,480
sick I have actually been to Ashley's

333
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:33,959
family home in Pebble Beach California

334
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:37,880
but at the time I didn't know how well

335
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:40,079
off she was she was actually in Malibu

336
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:43,759
while Stephanie was sick she kept saying

337
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:46,440
she was very far away I now wonder why

338
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:49,680
she didn't offer Stephanie more support

339
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:53,079
or come to see her she very well had the

340
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:55,639
means to do it instead Ashley put

341
00:14:53,079 --> 00:14:57,839
incredible pressure on me knowing that I

342
00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:59,759
didn't have postpartum support I didn't

343
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:02,040
have anyone there helping me supporting

344
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:04,560
me Ashley and Gretchen were both

345
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:06,800
marketing and running Retreats during

346
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,839
the time of Stephanie's illness and

347
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,759
after she passed the Retreats were out

348
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:13,639
of state and they had to travel to get

349
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:16,160
to them somehow Ashley could travel for

350
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:18,399
the Retreats but she never made it to

351
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,399
see

352
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:26,199
Stephanie yeah so while Ashley was busy

353
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:27,720
running Retreats with Gretchen in Hawaii

354
00:15:26,199 --> 00:15:30,319
and trying to make money off of the

355
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:32,839
medical medium community she was bossing

356
00:15:30,319 --> 00:15:35,880
you around and putting pressure on you

357
00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:37,680
to help even more than you already were

358
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:40,839
you and your husband were there with

359
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:43,759
Stephanie and you showed up to help but

360
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:45,480
Ashley on the other hand we now know

361
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:47,759
that Ashley wasn't physically present

362
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:50,000
for any part of Stephanie's breast lump

363
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:52,240
Discovery she wasn't around for any part

364
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,360
of Stephanie's back injury she didn't

365
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:57,319
visit Stephanie in the hospital

366
00:15:54,360 --> 00:16:00,120
once as we covered earlier on in these

367
00:15:57,319 --> 00:16:02,759
podcasts Ashley the daughter of a

368
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:05,040
billionaire family with a private jet

369
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:08,000
was on a private jet headed to

370
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:11,040
Pennsylvania where Stephanie was just a

371
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:14,279
few months before Stephanie died and

372
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,279
Ashley still didn't visit

373
00:16:14,319 --> 00:16:20,480
her yeah I know that Stephanie's family

374
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:23,440
didn't even like Ashley or any of the

375
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,839
Potters at the time they didn't like the

376
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,639
way that she lived they didn't like the

377
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:31,040
way that Steph ate which by the way

378
00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:33,360
wasn't exactly medical median she did so

379
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,360
many

380
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:41,839
things so the family didn't like Ashley

381
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:44,319
Ashley wasn't around at all and somehow

382
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:47,800
for some reason Ashley has tried to

383
00:16:44,319 --> 00:16:50,360
position herself as an authority on

384
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:52,279
Stephanie I want to bring us back to

385
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:54,240
when Ashley posted her original false

386
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:57,480
story online in

387
00:16:54,240 --> 00:17:00,120
2020 Ashley made more than 15 false

388
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:03,399
claims in one verse version and more

389
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:05,880
than 20 false claims in another version

390
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:08,160
your husband however having firsthand

391
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:10,240
knowledge of what had occurred corrected

392
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:13,280
Ashley in the comments of one of her

393
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:15,559
posts he said but you're missing the

394
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:17,839
critical part when Anthony at Medical

395
00:17:15,559 --> 00:17:20,839
medium told her she needed to see a

396
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:23,439
doctor and have the lump dealt with oh I

397
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:26,559
forgot that doesn't fit your

398
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:29,360
agenda Ashley replied to this by

399
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:31,799
saying Anthony didn't tell her to see a

400
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:34,280
doctor until she was bleeding from her

401
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:37,799
nipples the same point at which he

402
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:37,799
stopped communicating with

403
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:44,080
her at this point in the plotter podcast

404
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:47,880
series we all know that this is far from

405
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:50,520
the truth to this your husband responded

406
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:52,640
by saying I don't know the whole story

407
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:55,720
nor claim to but if you are going to

408
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:57,880
claim the truth needs to be out there at

409
00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:00,320
least do such a thing in its entirety

410
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:02,280
the above is one case in point which you

411
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,520
just acknowledge you skipped over and

412
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:06,159
I'm sure there are others kind of

413
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:09,039
calling the kettle black when you want

414
00:18:06,159 --> 00:18:11,520
to make allegations of people being

415
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:13,720
Liars your husband called Ashley out for

416
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:16,600
being inaccurate and falsely narrating

417
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:19,120
the story the way that it served her

418
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:20,919
agenda even people who didn't know what

419
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,559
happened with Stephanie found Ashley's

420
00:18:20,919 --> 00:18:25,320
story to be alarmingly inconsistent with

421
00:18:23,559 --> 00:18:28,320
what they know of Anthony and medical

422
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:29,600
medium information one person commented

423
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,520
and said

424
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,919
doesn't he always say to see a doctor

425
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,720
and see what the diagnosis is and go

426
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:38,039
from

427
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:41,200
there another person added I listen to

428
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:43,240
Anthony's podcasts and have never heard

429
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:46,240
him suggest not to see a doctor

430
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:48,080
conventional or otherwise I find it hard

431
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:51,120
to believe your claim that Anthony

432
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:54,080
explicitly told her not to see a

433
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:56,559
doctor after all of the push back and

434
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:59,720
being corrected by your husband Ashley

435
00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:02,840
commented this I tried to add it to my

436
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:07,320
post but Instagram won't let me but if

437
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:11,080
IG will allow me later I will add

438
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:14,080
it initially Ashley left out any mention

439
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:15,840
of any doctors being involved then here

440
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,720
because of your husband's correction and

441
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:20,600
the push back she was getting she

442
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:23,120
changed her story and went on from there

443
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:26,000
to say Anthony told Stephanie to see a

444
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:28,760
doctor but not until it was too late

445
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,440
which is still very far from the truth

446
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:34,520
and with all of her blatant false claims

447
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:37,480
Ashley caused a lot of damage one

448
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:39,360
comment on this post read he should have

449
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:42,240
told her to see a doctor the moment she

450
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:45,440
found the lump and told him it should be

451
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:47,679
a lesson for him and any healer I've

452
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:50,480
heard similar stories many times with

453
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:52,240
other healers I'm just so so sorry again

454
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,880
to hear

455
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:57,240
this we hope that this person has now

456
00:19:54,880 --> 00:20:00,559
listened to our podcasts to learn the

457
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:02,400
truth even though they probably didn't

458
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:05,400
because they're probably long gone since

459
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:07,080
being scared by Ashley's false claims if

460
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:10,520
they have been listening they would have

461
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:13,760
learned that this is exactly in fact

462
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:15,480
what Anthony did exactly one day after

463
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:18,080
Stephanie reached out about her breast

464
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:21,320
lump Discovery Anthony and his wife

465
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:23,760
texted that you should always see a

466
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:26,240
physician even after being corrected by

467
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:29,799
her husband Ashley continued on with

468
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:32,200
more falsities she commented this

469
00:20:29,799 --> 00:20:34,600
he told her to see a doctor when it was

470
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:37,400
too late for them to do anything and

471
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:40,080
when he clearly realized he had screwed

472
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:42,400
up it was at this point that he also cut

473
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:45,080
off communication with her it doesn't

474
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:48,000
feel very relevant to me that after

475
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:50,400
years of telling her not to see a doctor

476
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:54,360
and that she would be fine he changed

477
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:56,679
his tune when she was incredibly ill

478
00:20:54,360 --> 00:21:01,080
there are so many false things in here

479
00:20:56,679 --> 00:21:03,919
it's disturbing not a single sentence is

480
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:06,320
accurate as we've covered Anthony told

481
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:09,679
Stephanie to see a doctor from the very

482
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:12,480
beginning he didn't screw up Anthony was

483
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:14,360
consistent in his messaging to Stephanie

484
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:17,480
all throughout the time of her illness

485
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:20,480
that doctor should be involved he never

486
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:22,919
changed his tune and Anthony was not the

487
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,880
one who cut off communication with

488
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:28,960
Stephanie we'll get to that more in a

489
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:31,640
bit but my gosh Kim no wonder you had to

490
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,520
make a statement I mean can you just

491
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:36,480
describe for us what was going on in the

492
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:38,080
community at the time after she did this

493
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,840
I know that many people had reached out

494
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,840
to me and I know that many people were

495
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,240
reaching out to you too what was the

496
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:46,520
impression that they had gotten from

497
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:48,960
Ashley's post Ashley compared Stephanie

498
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:50,880
to her own father who she said did

499
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:53,600
everything his fancy doctors told him to

500
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,039
do but summarized that none of them

501
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,840
actually had any idea what they were

502
00:21:55,039 --> 00:22:00,200
doing she said her dad did everything

503
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:03,480
the conventional doctors told him to do

504
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:05,760
and he died Stephanie also followed

505
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:07,840
conventional treatment yet Ashley

506
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:10,600
insinuated that Stephanie followed a

507
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:12,919
protocol designed by Anthony and died

508
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:14,840
this isn't true Stephanie received

509
00:22:12,919 --> 00:22:17,799
conventional

510
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:21,400
treatment as for the community it was a

511
00:22:17,799 --> 00:22:24,120
mess it became so divided the fear was

512
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:27,360
unbelievable what Ashley did was instill

513
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:29,240
fear in so many people it was like they

514
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:31,840
started thinking their spinach salad or

515
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:33,480
their spinach soup was harming them and

516
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:36,480
they went back to a standard American

517
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:40,360
diet or went back to eating

518
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:43,039
McDonald's it's horrifying and it's all

519
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:46,600
so far from the truth all based on

520
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:48,520
complete completely false claims I've

521
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:50,080
seen from the data that Stephanie

522
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:53,799
received conventional cancer treatment

523
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:56,520
for almost a year and because you unlike

524
00:22:53,799 --> 00:22:58,559
Ashley were directly involved with

525
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:00,880
Stephanie's situation you were there in

526
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:03,480
person you had the ability to set the

527
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:06,000
record straight so you and another

528
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:08,080
practitioner who was also directly

529
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,120
involved sent letters out to each of

530
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:12,720
your private communities I remember

531
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:14,559
those letters I remember the volatile

532
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,799
situation that Ashley had created with

533
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,600
her

534
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:19,520
disinformation you and the other

535
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:22,720
practitioner handled this with a

536
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:25,039
tremendous amount of care Grace and a

537
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:27,039
lot of respect while protecting

538
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:30,080
Stephanie and her private information

539
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:31,200
after Ashley had exploited her to serve

540
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:34,640
her own

541
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:36,520
agenda I have your letter in front of me

542
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,600
and here are some of the critical

543
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:41,360
clarifications that you

544
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:42,880
made Stephanie was not under Anthony's

545
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:45,200
care for

546
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:48,000
cancer Anthony did not provide

547
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:51,120
supplementation or food protocols for

548
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,520
her Cancer all cancer related medical

549
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:55,440
decisions were being made by Stephanie's

550
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:58,600
family and a few close

551
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:01,960
friends Stephanie received chemotherapy

552
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:05,400
and many other conventional Medical

553
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:07,840
Treatments you also shared in here about

554
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:10,840
how devastating it was for you to have

555
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:12,720
lost a friend and about how unhappy you

556
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:14,840
knew it would make Stephanie that

557
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,960
Anthony was being inaccurately blamed

558
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:20,880
for such a terrible

559
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:24,159
tragedy you had every right to send this

560
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:26,240
letter you had every right to make those

561
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:30,039
clarifications and we now know those

562
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:31,880
clarifications to be true as proven by

563
00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:33,480
the evidence that has been presented in

564
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:36,120
these podcast

565
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:38,840
episodes but Ashley obviously didn't

566
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:41,000
like that so can you explain what

567
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:44,120
happened after these letters were sent

568
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,399
out yeah Ashley started attacking me on

569
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:48,240
text on audio messages while I was

570
00:24:46,399 --> 00:24:50,760
driving in the pouring rain and then she

571
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,919
took the letters we sent to a very small

572
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:53,799
private

573
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:56,000
Community these were not public

574
00:24:53,799 --> 00:24:59,039
communities and she made a retaliation

575
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,640
post posting these letters public public

576
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:03,279
and then calling me and the other

577
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,279
practitioner

578
00:25:03,399 --> 00:25:10,399
Liars okay so let's unpack that in the

579
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:13,440
retaliation post Ashley made she said

580
00:25:10,399 --> 00:25:17,080
this some women I know were really upset

581
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:18,679
by my post they knew Steph personally

582
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:20,880
though I wouldn't call them good friends

583
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:20,880
of

584
00:25:21,159 --> 00:25:27,279
hers though we've got a false claim

585
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:28,640
right at the beginning now I think that

586
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:30,520
Ashley tried to discount count your

587
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:34,480
friendship with Stephanie to make you

588
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:37,640
appear less credible Ashley also did an

589
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:39,679
Instagram live on April 1st of 2020 in

590
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:41,520
which she took it even

591
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:44,520
further

592
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:46,440
um what about the response of other

593
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:47,760
practitioners defending him and putting

594
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:52,230
others

595
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:54,240
down man that's so hard to talk about

596
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:56,440
[Music]

597
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:58,080
um I mean first of all they called

598
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:00,720
themselves Stu's friends which was

599
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:03,600
really hard because they were not her

600
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,919
friends like they knew her they weren't

601
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:07,000
friends with

602
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:10,679
her

603
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:12,760
um it's it was amazing to me frankly if

604
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:16,600
I'm being totally honest it was like it

605
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:19,799
was kind of just shocking and for them

606
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:22,480
to see and walk through that experience

607
00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:27,000
um the only thing I keep coming back to

608
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:27,000
is they didn't know stuff that well

609
00:26:30,279 --> 00:26:35,360
so here she went as far as to say

610
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:37,159
publicly that you and the other

611
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,919
practitioner weren't friends with

612
00:26:37,159 --> 00:26:41,559
Stephanie at

613
00:26:38,919 --> 00:26:44,919
all I know that this is false first of

614
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:48,039
all because Ashley told me the exact

615
00:26:44,919 --> 00:26:50,080
opposite on the phone several months ago

616
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:53,200
as a reminder to everyone I recorded

617
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:55,520
that call and it appeared in our podcast

618
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:57,799
episodes and previous episodes and just

619
00:26:55,520 --> 00:27:00,399
so everyone also knows and understands

620
00:26:57,799 --> 00:27:02,240
that reporting was completely legal

621
00:27:00,399 --> 00:27:06,120
Ashley has made false claims about that

622
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:09,640
as well but here is what Ashley told me

623
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:12,520
in that call and I said this to Kimberly

624
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:14,320
then and I Kimberly is the only person I

625
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:16,320
really lost my temper with because I

626
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:18,880
felt like she was Steph's friend and she

627
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,880
saw what

628
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:26,799
happened Ashley said to me privately on

629
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:29,240
the phone that you were Stephanie's

630
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:32,039
friend and that you saw what

631
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:35,000
happened why is this the opposite of

632
00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:36,880
what Ashley shared in her 2020 blog post

633
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:40,360
because it sounds to me like she was

634
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:44,000
trying to deceive the public in Ashley's

635
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:44,000
live she also told this

636
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:48,720
falsity they weren't there at the

637
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:54,720
beginning of her journey they kind of

638
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:54,720
came in at the very end when Anthony

639
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:58,679
ghosted this one is even more ridiculous

640
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:00,559
I've seen

641
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:02,840
from all the text records that the other

642
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:04,600
practitioner Ashley is referring to

643
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:07,519
became friends with and started texting

644
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:09,720
with Stephanie in June of 2016 a year

645
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:12,200
before Stephanie's health really took a

646
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:14,760
turn and you met Stephanie at the live

647
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:18,080
event in 2016 and became friends with

648
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:20,279
her at that point as well I've seen so

649
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:22,440
much evidence of both of you having been

650
00:28:20,279 --> 00:28:25,200
there for her and offering your support

651
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:27,360
to Stephanie early on in her illness

652
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,880
Journey as we've talked about before

653
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:31,480
Ashley loves to to say that Anthony

654
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:34,279
ghosted Stephanie to get people riled up

655
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:36,600
it's a tactic but it's completely false

656
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:38,840
Stephanie's family cut off communication

657
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:42,919
between them and told Anthony in a very

658
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:45,600
aggressive way to stay away so Ashley

659
00:28:42,919 --> 00:28:48,720
made plenty of false claims

660
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:51,399
here yeah so Stephanie sent me hundreds

661
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:53,200
of voice notes many of them were a long

662
00:28:51,399 --> 00:28:56,320
voice notes that's the kind of

663
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:58,399
relationship I had with Steph I got many

664
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:00,600
times the daily update from her I knew

665
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:02,000
what she did from the moment she woke up

666
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:04,000
she would take me through her morning

667
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,600
morning routine and how she spent many

668
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:10,799
of her days her messages were personal

669
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:13,039
like really really personal they were

670
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:14,720
family they were about friendships she

671
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:18,000
asked for help supporting the ones that

672
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:20,600
she loved she always asked for advice I

673
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,880
know the very intimate details of some

674
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:27,320
of the closest family members to her she

675
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:29,559
shared it all she offered to stay in my

676
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:31,760
home when I was postpartum to care for

677
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:34,720
my son and to care for me the way that

678
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:37,360
she did for her own nephew I don't think

679
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:40,919
you share that much and offer so much

680
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,919
with someone who is not your

681
00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:48,919
friend yeah it sounds like the two of

682
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:50,799
you were close friends to me we also

683
00:29:48,919 --> 00:29:52,960
know that Ashley's claims are false

684
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:55,559
because we have audios that Stephanie

685
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:58,279
had sent to a friend talking about how

686
00:29:55,559 --> 00:30:01,519
close she was with you

687
00:29:58,279 --> 00:30:05,559
and him just become good friends really

688
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:05,559
sweet women and really great

689
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:11,960
people and about trips she had taken

690
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:15,120
with you tomorrow I'm actually going

691
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:17,640
away with um Kim you know Canim really

692
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:19,399
spare and to see Gretchen because she's

693
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:20,679
in Pennsylvania right now I remember I

694
00:30:19,399 --> 00:30:22,480
told you about that we're just going to

695
00:30:20,679 --> 00:30:24,679
go for like a couple days and spend some

696
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:26,240
time with her and then again in a couple

697
00:30:24,679 --> 00:30:29,240
weeks I'm going to go up again for a few

698
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,240
days

699
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:35,519
we also have a text that Stephanie had

700
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:37,120
sent to a friend about you that reads

701
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:39,320
she lives by my brother which is

702
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:41,960
convenient I introduced her to my

703
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:44,720
sis-in-law and fam and they have become

704
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:47,600
friends as well so that's been

705
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:49,880
nice and we have a long audio from

706
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:52,159
Stephanie talking about how you were

707
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:54,440
there for part of her back injury which

708
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:59,039
was months and months before Anthony was

709
00:30:54,440 --> 00:31:01,720
told by Stephanie's family to stay away

710
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:02,760
hi well I hurt my back in the beginning

711
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:05,360
of

712
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:07,880
June I you know I hadn't been doing yoga

713
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:11,440
for a while or Pilates and I ended up

714
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:13,960
just by fluke coincidence I ended up

715
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:16,039
doing them both in the same week and by

716
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,960
the end of that week my lower back felt

717
00:31:16,039 --> 00:31:18,480
kind of

718
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:21,159
weird

719
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:22,919
um weird enough where literally it was

720
00:31:21,159 --> 00:31:26,559
hurting to go on the rebounder so I kind

721
00:31:22,919 --> 00:31:28,039
of had to stop that uh and then I went

722
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:30,760
to the caropractor and everything was

723
00:31:28,039 --> 00:31:32,399
better like a day later but I only

724
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:35,120
waited like a few days to start

725
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:36,279
exercising again you know I started like

726
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,240
light you know I just went on the

727
00:31:36,279 --> 00:31:42,120
rebounder for the first couple days and

728
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:44,240
walked and did pocket gym but then after

729
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:46,559
a few days I was back into yoga fully

730
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:50,600
and I was like doing yoga every day and

731
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:53,360
pilates every day or almost every day

732
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:54,799
um and I was just feeling so good and I

733
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,679
just like wanted to do all these things

734
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:58,120
and it was so stupid in hindsight I'm

735
00:31:56,679 --> 00:32:01,679
like what am I thinking you know we know

736
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:03,120
better than to do that um just too much

737
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:04,960
at once like that especially since I

738
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,720
hadn't been doing it I mean I felt fine

739
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:08,159
doing it I felt I got right back into it

740
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:11,679
I was doing like intense stuff and it

741
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:14,440
was like great but clearly my body

742
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:15,880
wasn't right ready there and so I went

743
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:17,559
to the chiropractor again but then it

744
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:19,120
never it got a little bit better but

745
00:32:17,559 --> 00:32:20,720
then I was carrying all these heavy

746
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,919
watermelons which were killing me but

747
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,600
like I was hanging out with scratching

748
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:24,919
and Kim and like when I went up there I

749
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,679
just brought all these watermelons like

750
00:32:24,919 --> 00:32:29,639
seeed huge watermelons

751
00:32:26,679 --> 00:32:31,440
and I just from there it got worse and

752
00:32:29,639 --> 00:32:33,840
worse and I was with Gretchen for like

753
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:37,200
almost a week when I came home at the

754
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:40,000
beginning of i as I came home the 4th of

755
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:42,360
July it got it was like horrendous like

756
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:45,159
it got really bad

757
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:47,919
excruciating like super super bad like

758
00:32:45,159 --> 00:32:51,080
crazy spasming and neres like shooting

759
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:54,840
pains like and literally I've been home

760
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:54,840
doing nothing for the whole month of

761
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:02,720
July all of that goes to show that you

762
00:33:00,039 --> 00:33:04,840
were around and there to see a lot of

763
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,519
what happened including that Stephanie

764
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:09,799
injured her back by doing all of the

765
00:33:06,519 --> 00:33:12,200
physical things she just described which

766
00:33:09,799 --> 00:33:14,760
again proves Ashley's original false

767
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:18,760
story line wrong in which Ashley had

768
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:21,320
said this on March 7th of 2020 about

769
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:24,840
Stephanie in the spring of

770
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:27,360
2017 her back began to ache we talked a

771
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:29,760
little bit during her back injury she

772
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:32,519
told me Anthony said it was a yoga

773
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:35,320
injury I really don't remember hurting

774
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:38,760
it in yoga she

775
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:40,760
said Ashley claimed that Stephanie had

776
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:43,440
said she didn't remember hurting back in

777
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:45,720
yoga but we have several audios from

778
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:47,639
Stephanie like the one we just played in

779
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:49,960
which Stephanie explains to various

780
00:33:47,639 --> 00:33:52,840
different people all about how she

781
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:54,960
injured her back doing yoga and pilates

782
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:57,200
so obviously Stephanie was aware and

783
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,279
remembered because as we covered

784
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,919
previously

785
00:33:58,279 --> 00:34:02,519
Anthony didn't tell Stephanie that her

786
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:04,240
back problems were due to a yoga injury

787
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:07,000
Stephanie told people that she had

788
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:09,399
injured her back doing yoga and

789
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,839
pilates and then she was doing things

790
00:34:09,399 --> 00:34:14,480
like carrying heavy watermelons with an

791
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:17,639
already injured back that you witnessed

792
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:19,800
which made things worse so now I just

793
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:23,359
want to bring it back to Ashley's

794
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:26,359
retaliation post once more again she had

795
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:28,399
said this some women I know were really

796
00:34:26,359 --> 00:34:30,839
upset by my post

797
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:33,919
they knew Steph personally though I

798
00:34:30,839 --> 00:34:38,240
wouldn't call them good friends of

799
00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:40,079
hers and Ashley's April 1st 2020 live in

800
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:43,040
which she said

801
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:45,240
this

802
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:47,000
um I mean first of all they called

803
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:49,520
themselves Steph's friends which was

804
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:52,399
really hard because they were not her

805
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:55,000
friends like they knew her they weren't

806
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:55,000
friends with

807
00:34:56,040 --> 00:35:01,920
her we've shown the you Kim were indeed

808
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:03,839
a good friend of Stephanie's we also

809
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:05,760
have text and audio messages showing

810
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:09,400
that the other practitioner Ashley was

811
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:10,400
referring to was also in fact a good

812
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:14,359
friend of

813
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:16,079
Stephanie's on June 29th of 2016

814
00:35:14,359 --> 00:35:19,040
Stephanie texted the

815
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:19,880
practitioner you're so sweet I love you

816
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:23,440
dear

817
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:26,560
friend in a text from November 11th of

818
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:28,359
2016 Stephanie says to her I love you

819
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:32,079
dearly

820
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:35,560
in a text from December 29th of 2016

821
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:38,640
Stephanie said to her hey sweet friend

822
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:40,880
in a text from July 8th of 2016

823
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:43,960
Stephanie said to her it's also

824
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:46,800
validating when sharing with a trusted

825
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:48,720
friend and we have audios from Stephanie

826
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:51,000
discussing how much this practitioner

827
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:53,400
had helped Stephanie Stephanie's

828
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,319
sister-in-law and Stephanie's brother

829
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:57,800
who is now a plotter trying to take down

830
00:35:55,319 --> 00:36:01,000
the medical medium Community during an

831
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:03,240
extremely troubling time for them Tony

birth I'm here supporting them you know

837
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:17,240

00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:23,160
just so supportive and there for me the

841
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:26,960
whole time and anything we needed and

842
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:26,960
supporting tuny and Megan

843
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:33,720
there are hundreds and hundreds of text

844
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:35,560
messages that I've read going back and

845
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:38,000
forth between Stephanie and this

846
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:40,400
practitioner mostly of Stephanie asking

847
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,319
the practitioner for advice the

848
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:44,560
practitioner also helped Stephanie's

849
00:36:42,319 --> 00:36:47,440
family in a very significant way during

850
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:49,960
a very dark time for them Stephanie

851
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:51,599
regularly expressed tremendous gratitude

852
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:54,079
for the positive impact this

853
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:55,640
practitioner had in her life and in

854
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:58,119
her's

855
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:59,599
lives we've got all of this evidence of

856
00:36:58,119 --> 00:37:01,960
Stephanie calling this practitioner a

857
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:03,880
dear friend referring to you Kim

858
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:05,240
specifically as a good friend and

859
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:07,599
talking about all the time that you had

860
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:10,680
spent together including during the time

861
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:12,720
of Stephanie's back injury clearly this

862
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:15,160
practitioner and you were both very

863
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:18,880
important people in Stephanie's life and

864
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:21,680
Ashley told another big falsity to the

865
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:23,920
public I was even invited to Stephanie's

866
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:26,040
celebration of life I was around when

867
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:28,880
Stephanie injured her back I remember

868
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:31,800
her jumping on that trampoline with her

869
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:33,640
injury I supported Stephanie and met up

870
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:36,640
with her at the hospital the night that

871
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:39,359
her niece was born it's a strange thing

872
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:41,920
strange thing to have to qualify a

873
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:44,520
friendship but what Ashley said was so

874
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:47,319
hurtful because Stephanie was someone

875
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:47,319
that I really cared

876
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:54,640
about yeah I'm sure it was really

877
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:57,240
hurtful and it's a very it's a very um

878
00:37:54,640 --> 00:38:01,400
it's a low blow it was very low for her

879
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:03,880
to go there and so following the false

880
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:06,760
friendship claims Ashley's retaliation

881
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:08,960
post continued on to say this these two

882
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:11,640
women sent out letters about my post to

883
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:14,160
their entire communities they

884
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:17,000
essentially made it seem like I was

885
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:19,640
lying this was a really impactful

886
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:22,720
experience for me because something I've

887
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:25,440
never realized before is just how much

888
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:28,079
you can use facts and distort them to

889
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:33,200
create what's actually a lie

890
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:33,200
and there's nothing I hate more than

891
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:38,599
lying so Ashley is saying that what you

892
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,839
shared was

893
00:38:38,599 --> 00:38:44,440
factual but she's still calling you a

894
00:38:40,839 --> 00:38:47,359
liar and the irony of all is that she's

895
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:50,880
calling you a liar in a post that she

896
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:53,560
Ashley herself told more than 15 false

897
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:57,839
claims in one version of and more than

898
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:59,800
20 in another version of Kim how

899
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:02,520
frustrating was it for you to watch

900
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:06,000
Ashley do this

901
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:08,760
publicly it has been so heartbreaking

902
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:11,280
it's been extremely traumatizing for me

903
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:12,960
for my family the amount of stress that

904
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:15,960
Ashley has created with her false

905
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,960
stories is just

906
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:22,280
unbelievable

907
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:23,760
yeah and sadly she didn't stop there

908
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:26,160
Ashley tried calling you while you were

909
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:28,160
driving in the pouring rain and because

910
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:30,920
you didn't answer Ashley sent you a

911
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:32,280
barrage of textt messages and I want to

912
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:34,839
walk us through that

913
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:36,839
conversation in the very first text

914
00:39:34,839 --> 00:39:38,960
Ashley tries to rewrite history by

915
00:39:36,839 --> 00:39:41,200
retelling her false version of what had

916
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:43,440
happened with Stephanie she tried to

917
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:45,599
sell this narrative to you Kim when you

918
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:47,920
were actually there for Stephanie and

919
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:51,680
witnessing things that had happened

920
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:56,720
firsthand in person and Ashley was

921
00:39:51,680 --> 00:40:00,319
not the text says this hey girl I just

922
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:02,640
can't not not say something to you Steph

923
00:40:00,319 --> 00:40:05,720
was personally Guided by Anthony for

924
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:08,760
years she did every single thing he ever

925
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:11,200
told her to do she laid on her back for

926
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:13,800
months while her spine literally

927
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:16,079
crumbled because he told her she had a

928
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:19,200
yoga injury that later he ended up

929
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:21,359
staying with shingles and then when she

930
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:24,880
started bleeding from her nipples after

931
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:28,720
telling her she would never have cancer

932
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:31,599
his response to cut her off completely

933
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:34,119
and never speak to her again after days

934
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:37,640
before Steph died she was texting

935
00:40:34,119 --> 00:40:39,640
Anthony begging him just to talk to her

936
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:42,359
for you to write that letter and

937
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:45,119
knowingly mislead people about their

938
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:49,280
relationship is so absolutely disgusting

939
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:53,040
to me and just frankly

940
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:56,839
unimaginable this text has six false

941
00:40:53,040 --> 00:41:00,240
things in it six critical things that

942
00:40:56,839 --> 00:41:02,319
are completely wrong and it seems as

943
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:03,680
though Ashley thinks if she just repeats

944
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:06,280
them enough she'll be able to get

945
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:08,680
everyone to just go along with it I'm

946
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:11,400
going to walk us through the false

947
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:13,880
Claims One Stephanie did not do

948
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:15,839
everything Anthony ever told her to do

949
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:17,440
Anthony's consistent message from the

950
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:19,680
beginning was that Stephanie should see

951
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:21,480
a doctor for her breast lump and

952
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:23,319
Stephanie made the decision to wait too

953
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:26,200
long to follow that

954
00:41:23,319 --> 00:41:28,319
advice two Stephanie did not lay on her

955
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:29,440
back for months because Anthony told her

956
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:32,359
she had an

957
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:34,400
injury three Stephanie got stuck laying

958
00:41:32,359 --> 00:41:36,680
on her back because Stephanie said

959
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:40,280
herself she had injured her back doing

960
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:42,880
yoga and pilates and it was made worse

961
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:45,280
by Stephanie carrying heavy watermelons

962
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:48,000
and jumping on the trampoline which you

963
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:49,960
were actually around to see Stephanie

964
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:53,160
got stuck laying on her back because her

965
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:55,079
doctor diagnosed her with a disc injury

966
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:57,200
and because she was on a small old

967
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:59,359
childhood mattress on the floor that was

968
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:02,079
terrible for her back and made it too

969
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:04,040
difficult for her to get up four

970
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:07,720
Stephanie did not bleed from both

971
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:10,960
nipples she only bled from one and five

972
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:12,560
Anthony never ever told Stephanie that

973
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:16,440
she would never have

974
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:19,119
cancer and six Anthony did not cut

975
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:20,880
Stephanie off Stephanie's family told

976
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:24,040
Anthony to stay

977
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:25,680
away Stephanie did not text Anthony

978
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:29,119
begging him to talk to

979
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:31,480
her Ashley was so wrong about all of it

980
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:34,240
from the beginning and yet she continued

981
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:36,599
to berate you Kim for the factual letter

982
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:39,240
you had sent out to your small private

983
00:42:36,599 --> 00:42:42,440
Community further text messages in this

984
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:45,599
thread from Ashley to you said this she

985
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:48,760
found a lump in her breast three years

986
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:51,800
before she died and he told her it would

987
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:55,559
never be cancerous does that bother you

988
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:58,200
at all does it like hello is this hting

989
00:42:55,559 --> 00:43:02,599
home I get that you weren't there when

990
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:07,240
that happened but I was does that I mean

991
00:43:02,599 --> 00:43:10,240
come on that series of texts from Ashley

992
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:14,079
is not only incredibly condescending but

993
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:17,040
also has three more false things in it

994
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:18,839
the first one Stephanie did not discover

995
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:20,240
her breast lump when she was living with

996
00:43:18,839 --> 00:43:23,000
Ashley in

997
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:25,880
2016 Stephanie in fact discovered the

998
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:28,960
lump a year later when Ashley was not

999
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:31,160
around the second false thing Anthony

1000
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:33,800
never told Stephanie that the lump would

1001
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:36,440
never become cancerous he repeatedly

1002
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:39,079
encouraged her to get it looked at by a

1003
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:41,680
physician and here Ashley's putting you

1004
00:43:39,079 --> 00:43:44,520
down by claiming that she was around

1005
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:47,480
when you were not which is the exact

1006
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:50,520
opposite of the truth that's the third

1007
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:53,079
falsehood our data shows that Ashley

1008
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:54,800
wasn't around for any single part of

1009
00:43:53,079 --> 00:43:58,520
Stephanie's experience with her breast

1010
00:43:54,800 --> 00:44:02,640
lump her back injury her her cancer or

1011
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:04,720
her passing and yet you were physically

1012
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:06,720
there helping Stephanie as much as you

1013
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:07,760
could after just having a baby during

1014
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:10,760
Stephanie's

1015
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:13,720
illness you responded to Ashley by

1016
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:15,079
saying in all caps I'm driving in the

1017
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:17,359
pouring

1018
00:44:15,079 --> 00:44:19,800
rain which sounds to me like you were

1019
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:21,960
begging her to stop attacking you and

1020
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:24,599
then Ashley replied to you by saying

1021
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:27,920
this I'm not there to see it so maybe

1022
00:44:24,599 --> 00:44:30,480
it's not actually happening

1023
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:30,480
later

1024
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:39,200
cim and then she sends three IR roll

1025
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:41,960
emojis what Ashley is again

1026
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:43,960
condescendingly implying to you is that

1027
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:45,440
you don't believe in Ashley's story

1028
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:47,640
which we know is

1029
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:49,359
false she's saying it's because you

1030
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:51,800
weren't there to see it and that's why

1031
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:54,960
you don't believe her Ashley is saying

1032
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:58,559
that Ashley was there to see it and you

1033
00:44:54,960 --> 00:45:01,319
weren't but in reality it's the exact

1034
00:44:58,559 --> 00:45:05,800
opposite the real truth is that you were

1035
00:45:01,319 --> 00:45:06,680
there and Ashley wasn't the truth you

1036
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:11,000
were

1037
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:12,640
there Ashley wasn't if Ashley wants to

1038
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,559
play the comparison game and use

1039
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:16,079
physical proximity as a measure of

1040
00:45:14,559 --> 00:45:19,559
someone's authority to speak on

1041
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:21,680
Stephanie then in reality based on facts

1042
00:45:19,559 --> 00:45:24,800
Ashley loses at her own

1043
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:27,920
game however Ashley ends up going on to

1044
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:30,319
say this to you I know that you can see

1045
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:33,680
what you did I know

1046
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:37,240
it I don't know how you can live with it

1047
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:40,920
but I know you can see it and I hope it

1048
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:40,920
haunts you bye

1049
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:47,720
Kim and then you replied by saying no

1050
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:50,000
Ash we all tried to help with all we had

1051
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:52,240
when it was going on I know you don't

1052
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,000
realize that but it's the truth I was

1053
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:55,880
barely paying my own bills and was

1054
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,440
buying her supplements at one point and

1055
00:45:55,880 --> 00:46:00,240
doing everything I could with a brand

1056
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:01,839
new baby nobody saw that make me a

1057
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:04,440
monster

1058
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:06,800
though and then Ashley sent you some

1059
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:10,000
voice messages that we're going to play

1060
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:11,920
now Kim I don't think that you're a

1061
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:15,240
monster I think that what you did in

1062
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:18,920
your letter is you isolated facts and

1063
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:21,640
you painted an untrue picture of what

1064
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:25,160
happened it's just not

1065
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:28,040
true for you to use the facts that you

1066
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:31,960
do have and manipulate them in such a

1067
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:34,680
way I just I mean come

1068
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:36,720
on and honestly I don't even care about

1069
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:40,319
all the people that it impacted because

1070
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:40,319
they will have their chance to hear the

1071
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:45,800
truth I can't even call it lying because

1072
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:49,599
of the way that you used facts but you

1073
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:53,480
used them so articulately to distort the

1074
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:58,040
truth that it ended up being a lie and I

1075
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:58,040
hate that I can't stand liars

1076
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:09,040
wow wow just unreal

1077
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:12,480
Wow first of

1078
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:15,040
all I want to oh

1079
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:16,599
sorry it still gives me Goose Goosebumps

1080
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:21,800
hearing that

1081
00:47:16,599 --> 00:47:24,000
yeah yeah yeah yeah I can imagine it's

1082
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:26,480
she first of all I want to point out

1083
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:29,359
that Ashley said here that she doesn't

1084
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:31,400
care about all the people who her post

1085
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:34,000
impacted because she's saying that they

1086
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:36,599
will have their chance to hear the truth

1087
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:39,400
in fact the people Ashley impacted with

1088
00:47:36,599 --> 00:47:42,520
her false 2020 posts didn't get a chance

1089
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:43,800
to hear the truth before these podcasts

1090
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:46,880
if they're even still around and

1091
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:50,200
listening Ashley has impacted many

1092
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:52,839
people and hurt many people with her

1093
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:54,280
disinformation secondly Ashley's being

1094
00:47:52,839 --> 00:47:57,160
incredibly manipulative in these

1095
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:59,680
messages she's twisted everything around

1096
00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:01,800
so much it's actually scary she's

1097
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:04,079
attacking you relentlessly while you're

1098
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:06,440
driving in the pouring rain her

1099
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:09,000
information is all wrong she wasn't

1100
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:11,559
actually there and you were yet she's

1101
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:13,240
putting you down demeaning you and

1102
00:48:11,559 --> 00:48:15,520
admitting that you used facts so she

1103
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:17,520
can't actually call it lying but at the

1104
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:19,079
same time she's calling you a liar with

1105
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,920
all those falsities in her text at the

1106
00:48:19,079 --> 00:48:23,720
same

1107
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:26,400
time how did it feel to have a grown

1108
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:28,079
woman act like this and treat you like

1109
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:30,720
this

1110
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:33,119
honestly Amber I have PTSD from what

1111
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:34,839
Ashley did to me that night I was

1112
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:37,480
driving to my sister-in-law's wedding

1113
00:48:34,839 --> 00:48:41,520
festivities I was alone it was dark it

1114
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:44,160
was pouring down rain Ashley would not

1115
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:46,440
stop she wouldn't stop I had to call my

1116
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:49,599
husband on the phone because I was

1117
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:52,000
shaking at the time I was doing my best

1118
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:54,440
to protect Stephanie's privacy and to

1119
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:59,119
not let her be exploited by Ashley it's

1120
00:48:54,440 --> 00:49:01,240
really sad that Ashley has it this far

1121
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:03,319
I've now been attacked personally

1122
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:06,079
professionally my family has been

1123
00:49:03,319 --> 00:49:08,880
attacked Ashley is actually the most

1124
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:12,880
intimidating person I've ever

1125
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:15,280
met yeah I'm so sorry Kim that you've

1126
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:18,040
had to go through all that and it's

1127
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:21,319
really not okay that she's that she

1128
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:23,559
attacked you like this and it's really

1129
00:49:21,319 --> 00:49:25,160
Brave of you to come on here and talk

1130
00:49:23,559 --> 00:49:26,920
about it because I'm sure that

1131
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:30,359
everything we're discussing you know

1132
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:33,880
brings up a lot of emotion and what's

1133
00:49:30,359 --> 00:49:36,359
even worse is that Ashley didn't stop

1134
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:38,319
there that exchange that we just went

1135
00:49:36,359 --> 00:49:42,200
through was in

1136
00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:44,880
2020 now 3 years later several months

1137
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:46,400
ago after I caught Ashley and the other

1138
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:48,160
plotters for what they were trying to do

1139
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:50,280
to Anthony and the medical medium

1140
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:52,839
community and we exposed them in our

1141
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:56,040
podcast episodes Ashley went on a

1142
00:49:52,839 --> 00:49:57,799
rampage on social media rather than

1143
00:49:56,040 --> 00:50:00,400
addressing any of her false claims we

1144
00:49:57,799 --> 00:50:03,440
had corrected her on with evidence she

1145
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:06,040
pivoted onto other points of focus she

1146
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:07,839
began bullying and making fun of Anthony

1147
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:10,280
she made fun of the light blast and the

1148
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:12,359
collecting Stones meditation she made

1149
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:15,520
fun of the medical medium Community many

1150
00:50:12,359 --> 00:50:18,839
of its members one of her targets was

1151
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:23,559
you and shockingly your

1152
00:50:18,839 --> 00:50:26,079
kids on August 17th Ashley posted this

1153
00:50:23,559 --> 00:50:27,400
this is not enough fuel for a child to

1154
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:30,200
thrive

1155
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:33,160
if you watch closely you will see that

1156
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:36,079
the children of influencers who promote

1157
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:40,640
extremely restricted diets are often

1158
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:40,640
incredibly small just like Kim's

1159
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:50,079
kids in this she tagged you along with a

1160
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:52,400
screenshot of a photo of your three kids

1161
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:54,200
plates that you had posted that You'

1162
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:56,640
captioned Beach

1163
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:59,359
snacks the plates all have a lot of

1164
00:50:56,640 --> 00:51:01,440
avocado a bunch of cucumber sticks a

1165
00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:03,720
bunch of strawberries and a pile of

1166
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:06,280
cooked cassaba flour tortilla

1167
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:09,280
chips Ashley continues on in the next

1168
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:11,920
story post switching back to the priate

1169
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:14,160
convo for a second many of you are

1170
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:17,319
sharing more accounts of raw vegan

1171
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:19,359
children and it's really sad a few of

1172
00:51:17,319 --> 00:51:23,119
you have made the point that some kids

1173
00:51:19,359 --> 00:51:26,920
are just small and that's true some kids

1174
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:30,400
are just small but all ra vegan kids are

1175
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:33,359
noticeably small in a significant way

1176
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:35,880
I've never seen a single example

1177
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:38,440
otherwise bu would welcome being

1178
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:42,640
challenged on that

1179
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:44,200
point and then just a little bit later

1180
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:46,880
after Ashley must have gotten some

1181
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:49,960
serious push back on this she deleted

1182
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:52,359
the first story and then posted this one

1183
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:55,240
I did remove that repost of the lunch

1184
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:58,119
trays though because it didn't sit right

1185
00:51:55,240 --> 00:52:02,400
with me I don't want to tear down moms

1186
00:51:58,119 --> 00:52:04,680
on here however I still think it is sad

1187
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:09,680
and abusive to raise your kids on a

1188
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:09,680
severely restricted diet how about

1189
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:18,079
y'all when I first read this I was sick

1190
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:21,480
to my stomach this is truly despicable

1191
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:23,040
behavior from Ashley and I would ask any

1192
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:25,599
mom out there how would you feel if

1193
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:27,720
somebody did this to you and your kids

1194
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:30,079
everyone is entitled of course to their

1195
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:32,599
own dietary belief system but it is

1196
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:34,880
unacceptable to shame and attack moms

1197
00:52:32,599 --> 00:52:36,160
publicly for how you think they feed

1198
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:39,760
their kids like

1199
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:41,000
this next I have to walk us through and

1200
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:43,359
point out the falsehoods and

1201
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:46,280
inconsistencies here because it's

1202
00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:49,240
insane Ashley attacked yuk Kim for

1203
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:51,119
supposedly Mal nourishing your children

1204
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:53,960
referring to a photo of your kids plates

1205
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:56,799
as lunch trays when in the exact

1206
00:52:53,960 --> 00:53:00,119
screenshot Ashley used from you you

1207
00:52:56,799 --> 00:53:02,480
literally captioned it Beach snacks and

1208
00:53:00,119 --> 00:53:06,280
she has that in the photo that she

1209
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:08,200
reposted how much sense does it make to

1210
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:11,240
judge what somebody feeds their kids as

1211
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:13,960
a snack as if it were a meal first of

1212
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:16,079
all and then the snack plates in the

1213
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:18,319
photo have plenty of food on them there

1214
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:19,920
are piles of cooked cassava flow chips

1215
00:53:18,319 --> 00:53:22,000
with guacamole there are plenty of

1216
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:25,640
strawberries and cucumber sticks as I

1217
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:28,240
said they were Beach snacks they weren't

1218
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:29,799
intended to be a Thanksgiving dinner

1219
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:33,799
they were

1220
00:53:29,799 --> 00:53:36,839
snacks once again Ashley got it

1221
00:53:33,799 --> 00:53:38,920
wrong all of your posts online show your

1222
00:53:36,839 --> 00:53:40,720
fridge being loaded with huge amounts of

1223
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:42,960
food and your kids eating plenty of food

1224
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:45,000
with tons of variety your kids are

1225
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:46,520
obviously far from restricted and it's

1226
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,200
clear that Ashley was just trying to

1227
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:51,000
hurt you and I'm

1228
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:53,319
sorry thank you yeah she definitely got

1229
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:56,760
me with that one um it first made me

1230
00:53:53,319 --> 00:53:59,240
really mad I cried a lot and then I

1231
00:53:56,760 --> 00:54:02,920
actually started to laugh because it's

1232
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:05,280
just so insane we were traveling when I

1233
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:08,280
posted those trays it was my husband's

1234
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:10,880
40th birthday those trays don't belong

1235
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:14,839
to me but I can tell you they were giant

1236
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:17,720
man-sized trays my baby was one at the

1237
00:54:14,839 --> 00:54:21,400
time my daughter in preschool and my son

1238
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:23,760
is eight they're little young children

1239
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:25,359
you are correct Amber these were snacks

1240
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:29,280
to take to the

1241
00:54:25,359 --> 00:54:31,280
beach as for the insults about my kids I

1242
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:33,359
was so sick years ago before medical

1243
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:35,960
medium and these kids were raised with

1244
00:54:33,359 --> 00:54:38,720
the principles that healed my body none

1245
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:41,160
of them have ever had a cavity they

1246
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:43,920
rarely catch colds and flu and when they

1247
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:46,400
get something they bounce right back I

1248
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:48,720
attribute that to the way that we live

1249
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:50,160
and I would never call that restrictive

1250
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:52,760
illness is

1251
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:54,319
restrictive Wellness is freedom and I

1252
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:56,839
know so many of you would agree with

1253
00:54:54,319 --> 00:55:01,200
that

1254
00:54:56,839 --> 00:55:03,960
yes yes really well said and I also want

1255
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:06,079
to point out how Ashley conflates

1256
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:09,240
medical medium information with raw

1257
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:11,200
veganism yet again I know that your kids

1258
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:13,640
are not raw

1259
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:16,280
vegan yeah Amber my kids are not raw

1260
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:18,119
vegan they never have been I have no

1261
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:21,200
idea why Ashley would put me in that

1262
00:55:18,119 --> 00:55:22,839
category there's nothing wrong with raw

1263
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:26,839
vegans but my kids are not and they

1264
00:55:22,839 --> 00:55:30,760
never have been my son has consumed

1265
00:55:26,839 --> 00:55:32,160
cooked soup that Ashley herself made

1266
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:34,720
while I was staying with

1267
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:36,920
her um that was when we went to visit

1268
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:39,079
her family's home in Pepple Beach my son

1269
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:41,640
was also one of the first ones to trial

1270
00:55:39,079 --> 00:55:44,079
her cooked bread recipe and some of the

1271
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:47,240
cooked potato recipe in Ashley's ebooks

1272
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:49,119
that I always supported one scroll back

1273
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:51,480
will let all of you see that my kids eat

1274
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:54,119
loads of produce yes they do and they

1275
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:56,480
enjoy it but they also consumed cooked

1276
00:55:54,119 --> 00:56:00,440
foods and they eat plenty of treats

1277
00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:02,520
they're kids you guys once again Ashley

1278
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:06,599
got it

1279
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:07,880
wrong yeah once again very wrong it's so

1280
00:56:06,599 --> 00:56:10,920
upsetting

1281
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:14,039
and I'm sure I'm sure it's so upsetting

1282
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:19,480
I can't imagine having my kids attacked

1283
00:56:14,039 --> 00:56:22,960
like that um it's so Ashley has actually

1284
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:23,920
seen your kids eat cooked food that she

1285
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:27,000
made

1286
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:30,119
herself and she still called them raw

1287
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:32,880
vegan it's it's mind-blowing correct and

1288
00:56:30,119 --> 00:56:34,960
correct what what's so insane and what

1289
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:37,280
also speaks to how carelessly Ashley

1290
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:39,160
just hurdles out attacks with paying

1291
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:42,960
such little attention to facts and

1292
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:45,400
details is that in the exact screenshot

1293
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:49,240
Ashley took from you and displayed in

1294
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:51,880
her post it clearly shows cooked chips

1295
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:54,839
on all of your kids plates you even

1296
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:57,520
tagged the brand of the cooked chips you

1297
00:56:54,839 --> 00:56:59,520
gave your kids as a snack with guacamole

1298
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:02,119
anybody could figure out that they are

1299
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:05,240
cooked chips and obviously if you're

1300
00:57:02,119 --> 00:57:07,880
feeding your kids cooked chips they're

1301
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:09,720
not raw vegan and what Ashley's saying

1302
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:13,240
doesn't make any

1303
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:15,400
sense Ashley got all of these things so

1304
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:17,240
wrong anybody who's viewing these

1305
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:20,880
stories can catch the inconsistencies

1306
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:23,520
for themselves but this is how Ashley is

1307
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:26,480
sloppy Ashley never has the details

1308
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:29,319
right makes mistakes constantly and

1309
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:32,359
leaves a trail of falsities

1310
00:57:29,319 --> 00:57:34,960
everywhere and then in this series of

1311
00:57:32,359 --> 00:57:38,240
attacks on your kids Ashley had the

1312
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:42,880
audacity to call your children

1313
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:45,119
small Kim your kids are objectively some

1314
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:48,559
of the healthiest and strongest looking

1315
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:50,799
kids that I've ever seen it's ridiculous

1316
00:57:48,559 --> 00:57:50,799
thank

1317
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:56,559
you I'm super blessed in that department

1318
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:58,160
and if you followed along with my

1319
00:57:56,559 --> 00:58:00,000
journey you've likely seen the pictures

1320
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:02,559
of my son that I've shared over the past

1321
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:04,079
year I'm pretty proud of him he's a head

1322
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:07,079
taller than most of the kids in this

1323
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:09,079
grade he's 90th percentile for height

1324
00:58:07,079 --> 00:58:11,000
he's a travel and All-Star baseball

1325
00:58:09,079 --> 00:58:14,200
player in fact he was on three baseball

1326
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:16,079
teams this year he's strong he's fast

1327
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:18,960
he's unbelievable and I know that sounds

1328
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:20,920
ridiculous because he's my son but I

1329
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:22,240
have every right to be proud after I

1330
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:23,839
went through what I went through with

1331
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:25,480
his birth and postpartum with him and

1332
00:58:23,839 --> 00:58:26,720
just being so unwell years ago before

1333
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:30,039
finding Anthony

1334
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:32,839
he's not small at all it's quite the

1335
00:58:30,039 --> 00:58:34,119
opposite my middle daughter and there's

1336
00:58:32,839 --> 00:58:36,000
been a lot of commenting about her in

1337
00:58:34,119 --> 00:58:38,000
the community because I've shared her

1338
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:40,520
too she's a gymnast she's an All-Star

1339
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:43,160
cheerleader who has literally abs of

1340
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:45,400
steel um if you've seen videos of her

1341
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:48,039
you've likely seen a lot of you have

1342
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:49,880
commented she's literally jacked the

1343
00:58:48,039 --> 00:58:51,640
girl has muscles that I didn't have when

1344
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:53,720
I was training during some of the most

1345
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:58,280
intense training periods of my life

1346
00:58:53,720 --> 00:59:00,359
she's muscle and my baby who is now two

1347
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:03,960
is literally a tub she's got a couple

1348
00:59:00,359 --> 00:59:06,960
chin rolls um so while this does make me

1349
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:09,319
angry and you know she did attack my

1350
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:12,400
children I really think that one simple

1351
00:59:09,319 --> 00:59:15,240
photo tells it all it's time for me to

1352
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:18,000
speak out because actually Ashley is a

1353
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:21,720
bully she bullied my children who does

1354
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:23,280
that really who does that these are lies

1355
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:25,440
she has no business commenting on my

1356
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:26,680
children she has no idea how big or

1357
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:28,599
small they are

1358
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:30,839
she has no idea what they

1359
00:59:28,599 --> 00:59:32,520
eat I'm still laughing at the

1360
00:59:30,839 --> 00:59:34,720
accusations from the chips and guacamole

1361
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:37,839
plate that was my husband's

1362
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:40,920
40th birthday it was a party at the

1363
00:59:37,839 --> 00:59:44,400
beach this is just one example of how my

1364
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:46,760
life has been disrupted for years now

1365
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:49,720
because of Ashley her social media post

1366
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:52,480
ruined that trip for me and my husband's

1367
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:55,720
40th birthday because they changed my

1368
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:57,599
mood completely they were hurtful and

1369
00:59:55,720 --> 01:00:02,880
they brought a tremendous amount of

1370
00:59:57,599 --> 01:00:06,160
stress by publicly attacking me and my

1371
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:08,799
kids yeah it's terrible and it's

1372
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:11,359
ridiculous Ashley never should have

1373
01:00:08,799 --> 01:00:14,480
stooped that low she never should have

1374
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:16,839
done that then after Ashley clearly must

1375
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:18,400
have gotten called out Ashley said she

1376
01:00:16,839 --> 01:00:20,920
removed that post because she doesn't

1377
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:23,039
want to tear down moms on here but she

1378
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:25,240
still left another story post up in

1379
01:00:23,039 --> 01:00:28,599
which she attacked a different mom and

1380
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:30,640
her kid for their diet it's obvious that

1381
01:00:28,599 --> 01:00:32,960
the whole point of these posts was to

1382
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:34,400
put down moms for how Ashley thinks they

1383
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:37,680
feed their kids in the way that their

1384
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:41,640
kids look and like you said Kim who does

1385
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:44,079
that Ashley literally used the word

1386
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:46,680
abuse and applied that you were abusing

1387
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:48,520
your kids by what you're feeding them

1388
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:49,799
when she wasn't even accurate with any

1389
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:53,200
of her

1390
01:00:49,799 --> 01:00:55,319
claims there's nothing more egregious

1391
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:57,440
Ashley just didn't get away with it and

1392
01:00:55,319 --> 01:01:00,640
after receiving push back that's when

1393
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:01,680
she deleted some of it your kids are not

1394
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:04,280
even raw

1395
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:07,960
vegan some of it yeah she deleted only

1396
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:11,000
some of it and left other parts up

1397
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:12,640
yeah your kids are not even raw vegan

1398
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:15,119
medical medium information is not the

1399
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:17,720
same thing as raw veganism her posts

1400
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:20,000
don't make logical sense Ashley's raw

1401
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:22,440
vegan attacks are also especially

1402
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:26,240
baffling to me considering the fact that

1403
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:30,119
many of her own best friends and co-plot

1404
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:32,599
are actually raw vegans yeah I wonder

1405
01:01:30,119 --> 01:01:34,799
how Ashley's raw vegan co- plotters and

1406
01:01:32,599 --> 01:01:36,520
best friends feel now about how they

1407
01:01:34,799 --> 01:01:38,640
have supported Ashley and getting to

1408
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:41,039
where she is now that she uses her

1409
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:43,760
platform to viciously criticize the diet

1410
01:01:41,039 --> 01:01:46,520
that they follow and promote in their

1411
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:49,760
businesses going as far as to call moms

1412
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:52,520
who feed their kids raw vegan food

1413
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:54,920
abusive plus what Ashley said in this

1414
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:58,680
Rampage is wildly contradictive to what

1415
01:01:54,920 --> 01:02:01,119
Ashley has said self in the past in an

1416
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:03,960
Instagram story post that Ashley made at

1417
01:02:01,119 --> 01:02:06,640
the end of 2019 to sell her own ebook

1418
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:09,680
she said this you deserve to nourish

1419
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:11,440
your body in whatever way you choose

1420
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:14,279
without fear of

1421
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:17,520
condemnation you deserve unquestioned

1422
01:02:14,279 --> 01:02:20,359
authority over what your children are

1423
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:22,680
fed

1424
01:02:20,359 --> 01:02:25,440
unreal wild

1425
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:26,680
contradiction this is another prime

1426
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:30,279
example

1427
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:32,880
of sloppy Ashley it's a prime example of

1428
01:02:30,279 --> 01:02:36,440
someone who is always changing to fit a

1429
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:39,799
narrative that suits her agenda of the

1430
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:42,200
moment Kim this was absolutely

1431
01:02:39,799 --> 01:02:45,000
reprehensible of Ashley to- do to your

1432
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:46,640
to you and your family and I'm so sorry

1433
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:48,200
that you were the target of this attack

1434
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:49,520
and that your kids were the target of

1435
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:52,839
this

1436
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:55,079
attack it's been a lot it's impacted my

1437
01:02:52,839 --> 01:02:56,520
husband in a big way too it's been

1438
01:02:55,079 --> 01:02:59,920
completely

1439
01:02:56,520 --> 01:03:02,680
unnecessary stress and from mother to

1440
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:05,119
mother all I think about every time she

1441
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:07,760
puts these posts out there is that this

1442
01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:10,359
is time and energy away from our kids

1443
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:12,039
and away from our families we're not

1444
01:03:10,359 --> 01:03:15,279
getting this time

1445
01:03:12,039 --> 01:03:17,400
back like I said so many trips so many

1446
01:03:15,279 --> 01:03:20,119
family events so many holidays so many

1447
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:23,520
birthdays have been ruined for me

1448
01:03:20,119 --> 01:03:26,079
because of unnecessary abuse from

1449
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:29,520
Ashley Kim I can't imagine being being a

1450
01:03:26,079 --> 01:03:31,359
mom and then being publicly shamed for

1451
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:34,000
feeding your kids healthy

1452
01:03:31,359 --> 01:03:36,640
snacks and being shamed in a way that

1453
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:40,359
confuses people into thinking that you

1454
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:43,640
must be some kind of terrible Mom that's

1455
01:03:40,359 --> 01:03:47,200
abusively starving your kids it's

1456
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:49,920
uncons sadly Ashley has so many things

1457
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:52,760
wrong another exhibit on how Ashley

1458
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:54,760
makes mistakes it makes sense as to how

1459
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:56,799
Ashley got everything wrong to begin

1460
01:03:54,760 --> 01:04:00,160
with with the Stephanie story when you

1461
01:03:56,799 --> 01:04:02,920
look at how many things how many details

1462
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:05,000
and how many claims are twisted

1463
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:07,480
discombobulated and just straight out

1464
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,480
factually

1465
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:19,720
incorrect exactly exactly and now Kim I

1466
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:22,279
want to just bring us back to 2020 for a

1467
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:24,799
moment I know that Ashley was attacking

1468
01:04:22,279 --> 01:04:27,359
you in a similar way in the comments of

1469
01:04:24,799 --> 01:04:29,279
her retaliation post back then and

1470
01:04:27,359 --> 01:04:31,319
implying that you hadn't done enough for

1471
01:04:29,279 --> 01:04:33,680
Stephanie when she was sick your husband

1472
01:04:31,319 --> 01:04:36,880
defended you in a comment in which he

1473
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:39,079
said this to Ashley can't sleep because

1474
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:41,200
your comment of expecting Kimberly to go

1475
01:04:39,079 --> 01:04:44,240
in a hospital right after having a child

1476
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:46,520
is ridiculous postpartum mothers are

1477
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:48,359
supposed to be resting she wasn't

1478
01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:50,760
resting as she was making food and other

1479
01:04:48,359 --> 01:04:53,079
stuff to send to Steph on top of driving

1480
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:56,000
it to her before she was cleared to

1481
01:04:53,079 --> 01:04:57,799
actually drive all of this led to the

1482
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:00,119
issues you mentioned of an enlarged

1483
01:04:57,799 --> 01:05:02,880
uterus from not resting and taking care

1484
01:05:00,119 --> 01:05:06,160
of herself clearly wasn't enough for you

1485
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:07,720
I guess and for the record I was the one

1486
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:09,720
that held her back and didn't want her

1487
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:11,960
to do even more than she already did and

1488
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:13,760
kept her out of the hospital which is no

1489
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:16,319
place for a new mother if it can be

1490
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:19,760
avoided so I guess I'm the bad guy here

1491
01:05:16,319 --> 01:05:21,680
for trying to protect

1492
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:24,039
Kimberly all of this was playing out

1493
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:26,319
online at the same time as Ashley was

1494
01:05:24,039 --> 01:05:28,079
attacking you in the written and audio

1495
01:05:26,319 --> 01:05:30,400
texts we went through

1496
01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:31,760
previously and then there was an email

1497
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:34,440
you'd sent to someone who was your

1498
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:36,680
friend at the time the next

1499
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:39,960
morning I have that email in front of me

1500
01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:41,880
and it says thank you for the email last

1501
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:44,520
night Ashley started sending me terrible

1502
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:47,400
text messages voice messages and then

1503
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:50,000
that post I'm not sure what prompted all

1504
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:52,079
of it honestly I didn't even read it as

1505
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:54,880
I was at a family event honoring my soon

1506
01:05:52,079 --> 01:05:56,599
Tobe sister-in-law my poor husband was

1507
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:58,440
defending our side of the story as she

1508
01:05:56,599 --> 01:06:00,640
put my personal information right in

1509
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:03,000
that post and failed to mention that I

1510
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:04,680
had a baby who was just weeks old as we

1511
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:07,960
were still running around and trying to

1512
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:09,880
do what we could on No Sleep our lives

1513
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:11,640
are very different and I don't think Ash

1514
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:13,720
can understand a family that has to work

1515
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:16,359
for a living and care for their children

1516
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:18,319
without help and servants I'm not being

1517
01:06:16,359 --> 01:06:20,079
condescending but realistic the

1518
01:06:18,319 --> 01:06:22,559
statements she made about me were

1519
01:06:20,079 --> 01:06:24,520
appalling I was driving things to Steph

1520
01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:27,160
before I was even cleared to drive a car

1521
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:30,240
after birth these girls put that

1522
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:32,520
pressure on me my husband was so upset

1523
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:35,000
that he took on as much as he could I'm

1524
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:37,880
really really hurt by the twists and

1525
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:39,559
lies it's a different lifestyle and she

1526
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:41,599
can't wrap her head around a mother

1527
01:06:39,559 --> 01:06:43,880
working and caring for two children

1528
01:06:41,599 --> 01:06:46,839
without a nanny or understand that

1529
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:49,319
husbands leave and go to work all of

1530
01:06:46,839 --> 01:06:52,000
this on no sleep with a newborn and a

1531
01:06:49,319 --> 01:06:54,480
2-year-old but somehow I didn't do

1532
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:56,319
enough for her I had Gretchen staying at

1533
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:59,400
my home during such a sacred time of

1534
01:06:56,319 --> 01:07:01,960
having a newborn not to mention my fear

1535
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:04,839
of her being in and out of the hospital

1536
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:06,359
and around my tiny new baby I don't know

1537
01:07:04,839 --> 01:07:08,960
what the answer is here but she is

1538
01:07:06,359 --> 01:07:11,760
pointing a lot of fingers and there is

1539
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:14,319
no truth to so much of what she's saying

1540
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:17,599
I feel awful harsh and heavy energy from

1541
01:07:14,319 --> 01:07:20,400
her she has an agenda to spread fear and

1542
01:07:17,599 --> 01:07:23,000
make herself look like a hero I wish she

1543
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:26,079
would spread Steph's life and her love

1544
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:28,400
and her beautiful spirit this is just

1545
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:30,240
upsetting anyway I'm pretty exhausted

1546
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:32,160
from all of this I hope you are resting

1547
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:35,799
today as I can barely move from all the

1548
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:35,799
stress last night

1549
01:07:36,079 --> 01:07:42,279
Kimberly can you share more with us Kim

1550
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:44,440
about why why it was that Ashley and

1551
01:07:42,279 --> 01:07:46,839
Gretchen were putting so much pressure

1552
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:48,319
on you to help Stephanie more and more

1553
01:07:46,839 --> 01:07:51,520
when you just had a baby there was so

1554
01:07:48,319 --> 01:07:54,799
much going on and it was up to a 4-Hour

1555
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:57,279
drive one way for you why did Stephanie

1556
01:07:54,799 --> 01:07:59,000
need so help with food poor Stephanie

1557
01:07:57,279 --> 01:08:01,279
wouldn't eat the hospital food she was

1558
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:03,079
relying on friends to bring her food

1559
01:08:01,279 --> 01:08:05,400
when she couldn't get enough help from

1560
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:07,960
friends or family she just wouldn't eat

1561
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:12,520
looking back I asked myself why wouldn't

1562
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:16,239
an extremely wealthy friend send food a

1563
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:18,560
chef support something instead I was

1564
01:08:16,239 --> 01:08:20,600
pushed to the max I opened up my home

1565
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:23,199
postpartum to Gretchen who came to care

1566
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:25,040
for Stuff Gretchen was also met at the

1567
01:08:23,199 --> 01:08:26,839
airport with a hot tea and a home-cooked

1568
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:29,719
meal that my husband and I prepared for

1569
01:08:26,839 --> 01:08:32,520
her I wanted to support the situation as

1570
01:08:29,719 --> 01:08:35,759
best I could at the time but nothing I'm

1571
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:39,000
telling you nothing that I did was good

1572
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:41,040
enough nothing I don't get that time

1573
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:42,920
back with my newborn I don't get to do

1574
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:45,359
it again I don't get to hold her again

1575
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:47,880
as a newborn I don't get to be there

1576
01:08:45,359 --> 01:08:50,199
again with my two-year-old son I I went

1577
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:53,600
through all of this and that time is

1578
01:08:50,199 --> 01:08:58,839
just it's gone it's passed and now I

1579
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:58,839
live with Ash trashing me whenever she

1580
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:07,120
chooses and continuing to disrupt your

1581
01:09:02,359 --> 01:09:09,600
family time and it just seems really odd

1582
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:11,880
to me that you were the object of blame

1583
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:13,440
here and especially when you and your

1584
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:15,719
husband did as much as you could for

1585
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:18,080
Stephanie after just having a baby and

1586
01:09:15,719 --> 01:09:20,120
not living that close to her it seems

1587
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:23,000
like over and over again throughout the

1588
01:09:20,120 --> 01:09:27,560
whole Stephanie situation the plotters

1589
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:31,319
Ashley Robbie Taylor Christina Megan

1590
01:09:27,560 --> 01:09:34,199
Tony Gretchen have tried to place blame

1591
01:09:31,319 --> 01:09:36,400
on people who were actually trying to

1592
01:09:34,199 --> 01:09:38,359
help yeah many of Stephanie's friends

1593
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:40,520
were just doing the best they could to

1594
01:09:38,359 --> 01:09:42,359
help her when it was possible and that

1595
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:44,239
was all acceptable they were happy if

1596
01:09:42,359 --> 01:09:45,920
someone donated some time or some energy

1597
01:09:44,239 --> 01:09:48,679
or some food or whatever it was but

1598
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:50,560
somehow I was definitely a Target in the

1599
01:09:48,679 --> 01:09:52,359
whole thing I was being pushed to do

1600
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:55,120
more and more and more and whatever I

1601
01:09:52,359 --> 01:09:58,120
did it was not good enough I did what I

1602
01:09:55,120 --> 01:10:01,400
could in the situation I was in with a

1603
01:09:58,120 --> 01:10:03,760
brand new baby somehow the 2-year-old

1604
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:06,159
little boy and the several week old

1605
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:08,000
little girl that I had in my arms while

1606
01:10:06,159 --> 01:10:09,520
my husband was away at work was

1607
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,960
completely overlooked they just kept

1608
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:13,199
looking at me like I was some kind of

1609
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:16,719
robot that was supposed to go and do and

1610
01:10:13,199 --> 01:10:21,760
do more and more it was

1611
01:10:16,719 --> 01:10:23,719
horrible wow yeah wow and in reality I

1612
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:25,880
mean you were trying so hard to help

1613
01:10:23,719 --> 01:10:28,560
Stephanie in an impossible situation on

1614
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:29,920
no sleep that you actually had gasoline

1615
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:33,440
sprayed all over you to the point that

1616
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:36,120
your hair was drenched and Ashley who

1617
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:39,239
was putting all this pressure on you was

1618
01:10:36,120 --> 01:10:41,280
nowhere to be found and an exposure like

1619
01:10:39,239 --> 01:10:44,360
that of getting straight gasoline

1620
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:47,480
sprayed all over your head all on your

1621
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:50,199
hair all over your body it's treacherous

1622
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:52,679
that much gasoline all on your body

1623
01:10:50,199 --> 01:10:54,800
soaked on you like that gets absorbed

1624
01:10:52,679 --> 01:10:55,920
into your breast milk you just had a

1625
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:57,920
baby

1626
01:10:55,920 --> 01:11:00,360
and then your immune system is already

1627
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:02,760
comp compromised because you had a baby

1628
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:06,480
and then you yourself Kim were sick

1629
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:08,920
years ago this is a major exposure which

1630
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:11,520
could trigger your system and then if

1631
01:11:08,920 --> 01:11:14,080
you were sitting in your car right after

1632
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:17,199
you just had gasoline dumped all over

1633
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:20,920
you if you had accidentally hit the car

1634
01:11:17,199 --> 01:11:22,960
lighter with your elbow or your hand or

1635
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:27,080
your phone just by putting your phone

1636
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:30,400
down you could have gone up and Flames

1637
01:11:27,080 --> 01:11:32,640
all it would take is just one spark from

1638
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:35,600
an electrical wire from just the

1639
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:38,000
ignition of the car starting and you

1640
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:40,880
would have burned up and died along with

1641
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:43,199
your baby in the car all because you're

1642
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:46,600
helping out a friend Stephanie while

1643
01:11:43,199 --> 01:11:48,960
Ashley was sitting in Malibu in her

1644
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:51,719
multi-million dollar house and then

1645
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:53,960
spreading rumors and false claims about

1646
01:11:51,719 --> 01:11:56,080
how you and Stephanie weren't even

1647
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:57,480
friends yeah

1648
01:11:56,080 --> 01:12:00,000
not

1649
01:11:57,480 --> 01:12:02,800
friends it actually haunts me Anthony

1650
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:05,679
the whole situation haunts me it was

1651
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:07,760
traumatic like truly traumatic for me

1652
01:12:05,679 --> 01:12:10,840
and to have to live with the constant

1653
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:13,320
social media insults threats and stress

1654
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:15,719
it just brings it all up over and over

1655
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:18,800
and over again every single time I see

1656
01:12:15,719 --> 01:12:21,080
her starting posting it's like the antic

1657
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:23,440
start and I just it it all comes up over

1658
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:28,400
and over again for

1659
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:32,080
me I'm so sorry him thanks Amber

1660
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:37,719
and yeah you you

1661
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:37,719
also awful yeah it's

1662
01:12:38,199 --> 01:12:44,280
aw you also ended up unfortunately with

1663
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:47,080
an enlarged uterus because you were

1664
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:49,159
standing up constantly making food

1665
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:51,320
driving long distances before you were

1666
01:12:49,159 --> 01:12:54,719
cleared to and bringing food to

1667
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:58,120
Stephanie instead of resting postpartum

1668
01:12:54,719 --> 01:12:59,040
and at the same time Ashley was nowhere

1669
01:12:58,120 --> 01:13:02,560
to be

1670
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:04,400
found while you were going so far out of

1671
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:07,480
your way to help Stephanie that you

1672
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:10,480
risked your own life and your baby's

1673
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:12,840
life and sacrificed your body literally

1674
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:15,239
to help you did all of this because

1675
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:19,040
Stephanie was a close friend of

1676
01:13:15,239 --> 01:13:22,639
yours and Ashley was nowhere to be found

1677
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:24,199
yet Ashley has the nerve and entitlement

1678
01:13:22,639 --> 01:13:26,560
to imply that you weren't doing enough

1679
01:13:24,199 --> 01:13:28,840
for Steph and that you weren't even a

1680
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:33,280
friend of hers at

1681
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:37,120
all Yeah Ashley always communicated as a

1682
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:39,920
very entitled manipulative woman I just

1683
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:41,560
didn't know to what extent back then

1684
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:43,719
that she was

1685
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:45,239
entitled um when we all flew out to

1686
01:13:43,719 --> 01:13:47,520
Pebble Beach to stay in her family's

1687
01:13:45,239 --> 01:13:50,120
home Stephanie actually didn't have the

1688
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:53,480
money to go and it was a really touchy

1689
01:13:50,120 --> 01:13:56,600
subject but meanwhile Ashley the

1690
01:13:53,480 --> 01:13:59,000
daughter of a billionaire family didn't

1691
01:13:56,600 --> 01:14:01,880
offer support to her then I look back at

1692
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:04,080
those emails wondering why did Ashley

1693
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:06,719
not just buy her a ticket if they were

1694
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:06,719
such good

1695
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:12,600
friends yeah it's a really great

1696
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:14,960
question and I looked through those

1697
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:17,880
emails there are a few I want to read

1698
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:20,440
off for everyone the first one was from

1699
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:23,719
Stephanie to everyone on the email

1700
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:25,880
thread that Ashley had invited to a

1701
01:14:23,719 --> 01:14:29,120
weekend getaway

1702
01:14:25,880 --> 01:14:31,600
it was sent on January 11th of 2017 just

1703
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:35,440
a few months before Stephanie discovered

1704
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:37,679
her breast lump and it says hey I'm

1705
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:41,040
still in the unknown territory if I can

1706
01:14:37,679 --> 01:14:43,280
come or not financially at the moment

1707
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:46,040
not best however things could turn

1708
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:49,040
around and make it possible very quickly

1709
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:51,000
flight prices are low so that's a plus

1710
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:53,600
so I may have to wait as it gets closer

1711
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:55,960
to make a move is that

1712
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:58,679
okay this question question was directed

1713
01:14:55,960 --> 01:15:01,280
to Ashley and Stephanie said that flight

1714
01:14:58,679 --> 01:15:03,400
prices are low but still too much for

1715
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:07,400
her to afford at the

1716
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:09,199
moment then on January 22nd of 2017

1717
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:11,080
Ashley sends an email to everyone in the

1718
01:15:09,199 --> 01:15:13,159
group with a status update and some

1719
01:15:11,080 --> 01:15:14,760
background information about each person

1720
01:15:13,159 --> 01:15:18,199
for her friends who hadn't met each

1721
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:22,480
other before Ashley's update to everyone

1722
01:15:18,199 --> 01:15:25,000
about Stephanie says this Stephanie

1723
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:28,639
possible step is trying to make it work

1724
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:31,520
work financially I so want her to be

1725
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:33,800
there Steph is a wealth of information

1726
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:36,800
and a bright positive Shining Light in

1727
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:38,960
any group she's part of for dinner she

1728
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:41,600
likes to eat heads of Roma lettuce

1729
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:45,679
dipped in kind pepper and lemon if

1730
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:50,280
that's not next level I don't know what

1731
01:15:45,679 --> 01:15:53,159
is I was shocked by this email because

1732
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:56,080
here Ashley is actually praising

1733
01:15:53,159 --> 01:15:58,239
Stephanie for eating only lettuce with

1734
01:15:56,080 --> 01:16:01,920
cayenne and lemon for

1735
01:15:58,239 --> 01:16:03,960
dinner as we've covered a lot obviously

1736
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:06,760
a head of lettuce as a meal let alone

1737
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:08,960
for dinner is not enough it is not

1738
01:16:06,760 --> 01:16:11,080
MediCal medium information this is

1739
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:14,280
something Anthony absolutely advises

1740
01:16:11,080 --> 01:16:17,880
against it was Stephanie's pre-existing

1741
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:21,080
approach to food that here we see Ashley

1742
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:22,800
praising and calling next level like

1743
01:16:21,080 --> 01:16:25,679
restricting yourself is something that

1744
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:28,000
everyone should aspire to do

1745
01:16:25,679 --> 01:16:31,199
and Ashley said in this email that she

1746
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:33,440
so wants Stephanie to be there Stephanie

1747
01:16:31,199 --> 01:16:37,199
had said herself that flight prices were

1748
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:38,679
low at the time in 2017 flight prices

1749
01:16:37,199 --> 01:16:40,440
were quite a bit cheaper than they are

1750
01:16:38,679 --> 01:16:43,040
today I'm sure that she could have

1751
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:45,840
gotten a flight from Philly to La where

1752
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:50,400
Ashley suggested everyone to fly into

1753
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:53,400
from a Budget Airline for 99 to

1754
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:56,520
$150 Ashley is the daughter of a

1755
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:58,760
billionaire family and has a trust fund

1756
01:16:56,520 --> 01:17:00,320
as you said if Ashley was truly such

1757
01:16:58,760 --> 01:17:02,679
great friends with Stephanie and really

1758
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:05,760
wanted Stephanie there why wouldn't

1759
01:17:02,679 --> 01:17:09,600
Ashley have just gotten her the plane

1760
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:11,280
ticket yeah looking back I really do not

1761
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:13,719
understand it especially with all the

1762
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:15,239
finger pointing Ashley has done Ashley

1763
01:17:13,719 --> 01:17:17,159
let her miss out because Stephanie

1764
01:17:15,239 --> 01:17:18,560
couldn't afford it and then Ashley even

1765
01:17:17,159 --> 01:17:20,199
asked everyone in the group who was

1766
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:22,600
coming to her family's multi-million

1767
01:17:20,199 --> 01:17:25,600
dollar home for a weekend for a cleaning

1768
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:25,600
fee

1769
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:33,040
I saw that in the email

1770
01:17:29,080 --> 01:17:37,080
thread unbelievable a cleaning

1771
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:39,679
fee so after the Pebble Beach thing just

1772
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:42,239
a few months later Stephanie discovers

1773
01:17:39,679 --> 01:17:45,840
her breast lump in March and then she

1774
01:17:42,239 --> 01:17:47,960
injures her back and then she gets sick

1775
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:49,520
during the time that Stephanie was Ill

1776
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:51,639
how would you describe Ashley's

1777
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:53,600
relationship with Stephanie's family do

1778
01:17:51,639 --> 01:17:56,320
you know if they interacted were they

1779
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:58,880
close what was that like Ashley actually

1780
01:17:56,320 --> 01:18:01,159
talked negatively about Stephanie's

1781
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:02,800
family there was this constant thing

1782
01:18:01,159 --> 01:18:05,760
where the family wanted Stephanie to

1783
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:07,840
receive conventional Cancer Care and the

1784
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:10,480
plotters were not in agreement with the

1785
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:13,800
family's wishes Stephanie's personal

1786
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:16,360
wishes were pushed completely to the

1787
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:18,360
side at the time the plotters and the

1788
01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:21,800
family were not on the same page at all

1789
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:25,320
so it's so unbelievably strange to me

1790
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:28,560
that now they've come together to BL and

1791
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:30,120
attack Anthony who wasn't even involved

1792
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:32,560
in Stephanie's Cancer Care because the

1793
01:18:30,120 --> 01:18:34,360
family cut off communication with him it

1794
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:36,320
was a lot for me birthing a baby and

1795
01:18:34,360 --> 01:18:38,840
trying to simultaneously support a

1796
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:42,560
friend who was not well and listening to

1797
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:45,040
Stephanie stress literally stress about

1798
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:47,280
her support people closest to her not

1799
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:49,520
getting along I was dealing with the

1800
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:52,120
text threads with the plotters that were

1801
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:55,600
trashing and fighting with her family it

1802
01:18:52,120 --> 01:18:57,760
was horrendous seeing those plotters who

1803
01:18:55,600 --> 01:19:01,000
were disagreeing with and arguing with

1804
01:18:57,760 --> 01:19:04,239
Stephanie's family now representing and

1805
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:07,120
advocating for them or with them is very

1806
01:19:04,239 --> 01:19:10,199
confusing to me my own data clearly

1807
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:11,840
shows that there was a major issue

1808
01:19:10,199 --> 01:19:14,760
between the plotters and Stephanie's

1809
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:16,840
family my husband witnessed this in

1810
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:19,159
person when he went into the hospital to

1811
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:22,800
visit Stephanie the plotters and the

1812
01:19:19,159 --> 01:19:22,800
family were not on the same

1813
01:19:23,199 --> 01:19:30,239
page that's extremely interesting and is

1814
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:32,880
something that's very it's very

1815
01:19:30,239 --> 01:19:35,920
confusing to think about that as well

1816
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:39,280
and how things somehow changed and

1817
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:41,520
flipped in that way and then what

1818
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:43,520
happened when your husband went to the

1819
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:45,560
hospital to visit and bring food to

1820
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:49,360
Stephanie what what did he

1821
01:19:45,560 --> 01:19:51,719
see so my husband observed an argument

1822
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:54,159
between Taylor Stephanie and Stephanie's

1823
01:19:51,719 --> 01:19:55,840
family Stephanie didn't want the

1824
01:19:54,159 --> 01:19:58,840
treatment at the hospital that was being

1825
01:19:55,840 --> 01:20:01,560
offered at that moment she was crying

1826
01:19:58,840 --> 01:20:03,679
it's heartbreaking Taylor was on her

1827
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:07,040
team and she was fighting with the

1828
01:20:03,679 --> 01:20:08,920
family Stephanie wanted to go to Mexico

1829
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:12,239
for an alternative treatment but her

1830
01:20:08,920 --> 01:20:13,600
family didn't agree to this my husband

1831
01:20:12,239 --> 01:20:15,679
just wanted to have a genuine

1832
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:17,480
conversation with Stephanie the way that

1833
01:20:15,679 --> 01:20:19,560
he had so many times in the past but it

1834
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:21,159
was uncomfortable and impossible because

1835
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:23,719
of this conflict that was going on while

1836
01:20:21,159 --> 01:20:25,719
he was there instead he tried to be

1837
01:20:23,719 --> 01:20:27,480
helpful and find creative ways to keep

1838
01:20:25,719 --> 01:20:31,400
the food cold and be sure that juices

1839
01:20:27,480 --> 01:20:33,520
were kept fresh for her but the family

1840
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:36,000
they always hated the way that she ate

1841
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:38,159
dating back years before Stephanie even

1842
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:40,800
knew Anthony the family did not like the

1843
01:20:38,159 --> 01:20:42,239
way that she ate the family made my

1844
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:44,679
husband feel like he was a villain for

1845
01:20:42,239 --> 01:20:46,320
bringing food to

1846
01:20:44,679 --> 01:20:50,400
Stephanie

1847
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:52,520
wow so there was this massive ongoing

1848
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:56,320
battle between the plotters and the

1849
01:20:52,520 --> 01:20:57,920
family completely independent of Anthony

1850
01:20:56,320 --> 01:21:00,159
and just to bring this all together for

1851
01:20:57,920 --> 01:21:02,600
everyone all Anthony ever did in this

1852
01:21:00,159 --> 01:21:05,480
whole situation as we've shown was

1853
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:07,840
encourage Stephanie to see a doctor

1854
01:21:05,480 --> 01:21:10,280
offer emotional support and try to get

1855
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:12,480
her up off the floor she got stuck on

1856
01:21:10,280 --> 01:21:15,360
due to her injury so that she could get

1857
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:17,400
in for proper Medical Care Anthony was

1858
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:20,800
not Stephanie's health practitioner

1859
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:22,600
Anthony is not an oncologist in order to

1860
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:25,840
get diagnosed with cancer you need to

1861
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:28,080
see a board certified oncologist ologist

1862
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:30,199
from the moment Stephanie discovered her

1863
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:33,320
breast lump she was repeatedly told by

1864
01:21:30,199 --> 01:21:35,159
Anthony to see a physician if Stephanie

1865
01:21:33,320 --> 01:21:36,880
had listened to Anthony's advice to see

1866
01:21:35,159 --> 01:21:39,239
a doctor from the

1867
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:41,639
beginning outcomes probably would have

1868
01:21:39,239 --> 01:21:43,760
been entirely different and we probably

1869
01:21:41,639 --> 01:21:47,000
wouldn't need to be sitting here today

1870
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:49,400
to talk about this and you Kim you even

1871
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:52,000
talked with Stephanie early on about

1872
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:54,360
doctors she could see in the area that

1873
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:56,440
were near her and you said earlier on

1874
01:21:54,360 --> 01:21:58,159
that Stephanie wasn't receptive to that

1875
01:21:56,440 --> 01:22:01,800
at the

1876
01:21:58,159 --> 01:22:04,040
time and so then Stephanie's battle with

1877
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:06,800
cancer ended up going on for about a

1878
01:22:04,040 --> 01:22:10,880
year after Anthony was told aggressively

1879
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:13,880
to stay away during that time again

1880
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:15,639
independent of Anthony the plotters were

1881
01:22:13,880 --> 01:22:18,199
fighting for Stephanie to get some kind

1882
01:22:15,639 --> 01:22:20,239
of alternative treatment for her cancer

1883
01:22:18,199 --> 01:22:22,520
while the family on the other hand

1884
01:22:20,239 --> 01:22:25,280
wanted her to do conventional

1885
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:28,080
treatment while Stephanie was SI sick

1886
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:31,960
the plotters and the family were at odds

1887
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:33,800
Waring with each other and then when did

1888
01:22:31,960 --> 01:22:36,040
things change when did you see the

1889
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:37,760
plotter start coming around and and

1890
01:22:36,040 --> 01:22:40,040
coming together with the family to try

1891
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:43,000
to blame

1892
01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:44,760
Anthony I honestly didn't see things

1893
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:47,040
change until years after Stephanie

1894
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:48,560
passed away months after Stephanie

1895
01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:50,880
passed away I was invited to her

1896
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:54,120
celebration of life the plotters were

1897
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:55,880
offering Retreats yeah they were

1898
01:22:54,120 --> 01:22:58,800
offering retreats to the medical medium

1899
01:22:55,880 --> 01:23:00,920
community and then all of a sudden the

1900
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:03,920
pters changed their tune it was

1901
01:23:00,920 --> 01:23:07,719
literally overnight and to me that seems

1902
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:07,719
so clear that an agenda was

1903
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:16,800
born yeah it's pretty crazy and then I

1904
01:23:14,360 --> 01:23:19,199
want to bring it back to when Stephanie

1905
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:21,199
was Ill when you went to go bring

1906
01:23:19,199 --> 01:23:23,719
Stephanie food at the time that she was

1907
01:23:21,199 --> 01:23:25,800
living in her family's home what was

1908
01:23:23,719 --> 01:23:27,719
that experience like for you I went to

1909
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:29,840
Stephanie's family's home to pick

1910
01:23:27,719 --> 01:23:32,400
Gretchen up who was going to stay in my

1911
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:34,040
home Gretchen was using my husband's car

1912
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:36,600
but on that day he had to travel for

1913
01:23:34,040 --> 01:23:38,800
work so I drove to pick her up I was

1914
01:23:36,600 --> 01:23:40,639
drenched And Gasoline by the time that I

1915
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:43,080
got there and needed to take a shower

1916
01:23:40,639 --> 01:23:44,960
and rinse off as quickly as possible I

1917
01:23:43,080 --> 01:23:47,440
showered in one of Stephanie's family's

1918
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:49,360
bathrooms it was a really scary time for

1919
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:51,080
me I had my newborn baby and I brought

1920
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:53,320
her in her little car seat because

1921
01:23:51,080 --> 01:23:54,560
Stephanie wanted to meet her she

1922
01:23:53,320 --> 01:23:57,480
actually wasn't able to hold the the

1923
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:59,600
baby due to the drugs that she was on I

1924
01:23:57,480 --> 01:24:01,719
dropped off some food for her and was

1925
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:03,800
just in shocked from all that happened

1926
01:24:01,719 --> 01:24:06,040
with the gasoline and all that was

1927
01:24:03,800 --> 01:24:08,000
happening around me in that moment it

1928
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:10,000
was around the same time when I was told

1929
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:12,040
by Gretchen that she had observed

1930
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:13,960
Stephanie with dust bunnies on her head

1931
01:24:12,040 --> 01:24:16,520
and face and that Gretchen had to dust

1932
01:24:13,960 --> 01:24:18,440
her off when she arrived in her home my

1933
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:20,679
heart was broken and honestly it's still

1934
01:24:18,440 --> 01:24:20,679
is

1935
01:24:21,080 --> 01:24:28,360
Amber that is horrifying and and the

1936
01:24:25,639 --> 01:24:32,080
fact that it was Gretchen who is now a

1937
01:24:28,360 --> 01:24:33,719
plotter who saw the dust situation is

1938
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:36,199
especially

1939
01:24:33,719 --> 01:24:38,440
interesting yeah it was horrible all of

1940
01:24:36,199 --> 01:24:40,199
it the the whole situation was horrible

1941
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:42,800
it was so hard to see it was hard to

1942
01:24:40,199 --> 01:24:44,320
hear it was hard to experience and all

1943
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:46,400
at the same time with everything that I

1944
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:49,280
had going on I felt so terrible for

1945
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:50,639
Stephanie and I couldn't understand why

1946
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:52,400
and everything that she was going

1947
01:24:50,639 --> 01:24:55,159
through that she would be covered in

1948
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:57,199
dust

1949
01:24:55,159 --> 01:24:59,239
yeah yeah that's something that's really

1950
01:24:57,199 --> 01:25:00,800
hard for me to wrap my head around as

1951
01:24:59,239 --> 01:25:03,920
well

1952
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:07,360
and so then it's some point when

1953
01:25:03,920 --> 01:25:11,440
Stephanie was sick Taylor Who's now also

1954
01:25:07,360 --> 01:25:13,440
a plotter stepped in could you explain

1955
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:16,000
what your experience was like with her

1956
01:25:13,440 --> 01:25:19,119
and what role Taylor

1957
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:21,080
played so Taylor was one of the ones

1958
01:25:19,119 --> 01:25:24,520
arguing at the hospital she basically

1959
01:25:21,080 --> 01:25:27,239
took over but she also was not fond of

1960
01:25:24,520 --> 01:25:30,159
the family and they were not F of her

1961
01:25:27,239 --> 01:25:31,960
Taylor was in charge though or at least

1962
01:25:30,159 --> 01:25:35,239
she thought she was in charge of the

1963
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:38,000
whole situation she was so manipulative

1964
01:25:35,239 --> 01:25:40,600
and so bossy on the text messages and on

1965
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:43,080
the phone I had never even met her in

1966
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:45,239
person like have never met this woman

1967
01:25:43,080 --> 01:25:47,440
ever yet she was calling me out and

1968
01:25:45,239 --> 01:25:49,679
saying I needed to do more even though I

1969
01:25:47,440 --> 01:25:52,239
had a newborn and I remember thinking

1970
01:25:49,679 --> 01:25:53,760
that she was really insensitive and mean

1971
01:25:52,239 --> 01:25:55,520
and I didn't and and she just didn't

1972
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:57,600
realize I'm like does this woman realize

1973
01:25:55,520 --> 01:25:59,960
I have a newborn right now she she just

1974
01:25:57,600 --> 01:26:03,080
didn't

1975
01:25:59,960 --> 01:26:04,960
understand yeah that that description

1976
01:26:03,080 --> 01:26:07,080
especially the bossiness matches a lot

1977
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:10,840
of the experiences that I had with

1978
01:26:07,080 --> 01:26:13,159
Taylor several months ago in person um

1979
01:26:10,840 --> 01:26:16,280
so so Stephanie was in a vulnerable

1980
01:26:13,159 --> 01:26:18,760
position her back injury prevented her

1981
01:26:16,280 --> 01:26:20,560
from being able to do much herself she

1982
01:26:18,760 --> 01:26:23,320
was having a hard time getting the food

1983
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:24,840
that she needed you said earlier that

1984
01:26:23,320 --> 01:26:28,360
she wasn't really making her own

1985
01:26:24,840 --> 01:26:31,159
decisions Taylor who was acting you know

1986
01:26:28,360 --> 01:26:33,560
as her caretaker and Stephanie's family

1987
01:26:31,159 --> 01:26:35,199
were making a lot of decisions for her

1988
01:26:33,560 --> 01:26:37,920
you were being supportive and trying to

1989
01:26:35,199 --> 01:26:39,960
help out as best as you could did you

1990
01:26:37,920 --> 01:26:42,400
and Stephanie stay in touch throughout

1991
01:26:39,960 --> 01:26:45,639
the course of her illness or how did

1992
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:47,800
that go so for a long time we were in

1993
01:26:45,639 --> 01:26:49,600
Daily communication personally and also

1994
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:51,119
in group chats with various different

1995
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:53,960
plotters that were discussing

1996
01:26:51,119 --> 01:26:55,760
Stephanie's situation all of a sudden

1997
01:26:53,960 --> 01:26:58,040
out of the blue Stephanie stopped

1998
01:26:55,760 --> 01:26:59,880
responding to me I was told by Gretchen

1999
01:26:58,040 --> 01:27:03,199
that her brother took her phone away and

2000
01:26:59,880 --> 01:27:05,679
I never heard from her again I was also

2001
01:27:03,199 --> 01:27:07,560
removed from the group chats it was very

2002
01:27:05,679 --> 01:27:09,880
very weird because Stephanie normally

2003
01:27:07,560 --> 01:27:12,440
would text a lot and send a lot of audio

2004
01:27:09,880 --> 01:27:15,159
messages and all of that I was again

2005
01:27:12,440 --> 01:27:17,000
newly postpartum so swallowing this was

2006
01:27:15,159 --> 01:27:19,080
all really hard and I was just trying to

2007
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:21,400
survive and feeling completely

2008
01:27:19,080 --> 01:27:26,000
heartbroken at the same

2009
01:27:21,400 --> 01:27:28,639
time wow yeah so you were told by

2010
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:31,520
Gretchen that Stephanie's brother took

2011
01:27:28,639 --> 01:27:31,520
Stephanie's phone

2012
01:27:31,719 --> 01:27:36,840
away wow and we actually have text

2013
01:27:35,199 --> 01:27:38,360
messages and audio recordings

2014
01:27:36,840 --> 01:27:40,920
corroborating what you just said that

2015
01:27:38,360 --> 01:27:42,800
we'll be sharing in another episode it's

2016
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:44,600
really sad that you had the same

2017
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:46,480
experience as other friends of

2018
01:27:44,600 --> 01:27:49,000
Stephanie's who were either cut off

2019
01:27:46,480 --> 01:27:51,480
without explanation or were told that

2020
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:54,400
they were not allowed to speak with her

2021
01:27:51,480 --> 01:27:56,840
yeah and then I'm also curious about

2022
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:59,520
experience with Stephanie before she got

2023
01:27:56,840 --> 01:28:01,159
sick what were Stephanie's eating habits

2024
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:03,719
like before she got

2025
01:28:01,159 --> 01:28:05,960
sick so actually shocking to me as

2026
01:28:03,719 --> 01:28:07,880
someone that eats a very clean diet

2027
01:28:05,960 --> 01:28:10,159
which has reversed my own symptoms years

2028
01:28:07,880 --> 01:28:12,679
ago I I was actually shocked when I met

2029
01:28:10,159 --> 01:28:15,280
Stephanie for lunch or at a juice bar

2030
01:28:12,679 --> 01:28:17,239
she wouldn't eat it was very rare that

2031
01:28:15,280 --> 01:28:19,320
she would eat something she mostly

2032
01:28:17,239 --> 01:28:22,360
wouldn't eat at all not even at a

2033
01:28:19,320 --> 01:28:25,600
completely organic juice bar one time I

2034
01:28:22,360 --> 01:28:29,000
actually had a car full of fresh organic

2035
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:30,880
produce like wholesale produce fresh and

2036
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:33,239
she wouldn't touch any of the fruit and

2037
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:35,159
she would eat only the lettuce and I

2038
01:28:33,239 --> 01:28:39,719
just always felt like she was starving

2039
01:28:35,159 --> 01:28:39,719
and it just it just broke my

2040
01:28:40,119 --> 01:28:46,080
heart yeah so you experienced Stephanie

2041
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:48,760
having some pre-existing problems with

2042
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:52,080
food just eating lettuce is definitely

2043
01:28:48,760 --> 01:28:55,080
not MediCal medium information and it's

2044
01:28:52,080 --> 01:28:57,480
really sad frankly yeah and

2045
01:28:55,080 --> 01:29:00,280
yeah this goes along with so much

2046
01:28:57,480 --> 01:29:03,239
evidence that we have of what Stephanie

2047
01:29:00,280 --> 01:29:06,400
was eating and not eating which is the

2048
01:29:03,239 --> 01:29:09,560
exact opposite of the story Ashley tried

2049
01:29:06,400 --> 01:29:11,520
to tell starting in 2020 about Stephanie

2050
01:29:09,560 --> 01:29:12,239
following medical medium information to

2051
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:15,800
a

2052
01:29:12,239 --> 01:29:18,280
te so Ashley's told many false stories

2053
01:29:15,800 --> 01:29:21,119
about Stephanie and many other things

2054
01:29:18,280 --> 01:29:23,480
and now you've heard all the different

2055
01:29:21,119 --> 01:29:26,760
iterations of the infamous cat story we

2056
01:29:23,480 --> 01:29:30,000
shared earlier on in this podcast series

2057
01:29:26,760 --> 01:29:32,719
Ashley told me directly in my calls with

2058
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:36,040
her that Anthony had put her on a

2059
01:29:32,719 --> 01:29:37,119
fat-free raw diet and completely missed

2060
01:29:36,040 --> 01:29:40,400
the cat

2061
01:29:37,119 --> 01:29:42,960
allergy however one of the true

2062
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:45,840
versions of that cat story came from a

2063
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:49,440
text conversation Ashley had with you on

2064
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:51,600
September 14th of 2018 which was months

2065
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:53,840
after she had given away their pet cat

2066
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:57,480
because in fact Anthony had said that

2067
01:29:53,840 --> 01:30:00,440
the cat was part of the problem in

2068
01:29:57,480 --> 01:30:02,360
Ashley's text to you Ashley said that

2069
01:30:00,440 --> 01:30:05,520
Anthony told her to cut out nuts and

2070
01:30:02,360 --> 01:30:08,600
seeds specifically for her son's eczema

2071
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:10,960
but that fats like olive oil were

2072
01:30:08,600 --> 01:30:13,159
okay she also said to you that Anthony

2073
01:30:10,960 --> 01:30:14,760
had recommended lots of squash which is

2074
01:30:13,159 --> 01:30:17,800
something that would be cooked of course

2075
01:30:14,760 --> 01:30:19,679
not raw so Ashley obviously was not put

2076
01:30:17,800 --> 01:30:23,320
in a fat-free raw

2077
01:30:19,679 --> 01:30:27,040
diet yeah this one is really crazy to

2078
01:30:23,320 --> 01:30:28,920
hear so versions of this story Ashley

2079
01:30:27,040 --> 01:30:31,760
and I were actually talking about this

2080
01:30:28,920 --> 01:30:34,000
because my daughter had skin issues

2081
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:35,880
temporarily directly following my

2082
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:37,440
exposure to all the gasoline that I was

2083
01:30:35,880 --> 01:30:40,639
sprayed with while I was breastfeeding

2084
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:42,320
her I have texts from Ashley saying that

2085
01:30:40,639 --> 01:30:44,360
Anthony told her to cut out nuts and

2086
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:46,800
seeds specifically because of the

2087
01:30:44,360 --> 01:30:49,560
Arginine and that other fats like olive

2088
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:51,840
oil were okay and cooked squashes were

2089
01:30:49,560 --> 01:30:54,320
okay and that he suggested bringing in

2090
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:57,800
cooked squashes again along with

2091
01:30:54,320 --> 01:30:57,800
bringing in lots of green

2092
01:30:57,960 --> 01:31:03,639
juices yeah okay

2093
01:31:01,480 --> 01:31:07,440
so now I'm

2094
01:31:03,639 --> 01:31:09,400
wondering it's I mean years ago Ashley

2095
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:11,000
in all all these false stories I'm sure

2096
01:31:09,400 --> 01:31:12,480
Ashley years ago told you a lot of the

2097
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:15,080
false stories that we've debunked in

2098
01:31:12,480 --> 01:31:17,719
these podcasts like the origin of the

2099
01:31:15,080 --> 01:31:20,520
breast lump Discovery and the infamous

2100
01:31:17,719 --> 01:31:22,920
cat story and it's got to feel really

2101
01:31:20,520 --> 01:31:25,080
weird to look back and realize that you

2102
01:31:22,920 --> 01:31:27,000
too were told so many untrue stories

2103
01:31:25,080 --> 01:31:29,560
that were Ashley's foundational building

2104
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:32,560
blocks to get Robbie and the others on

2105
01:31:29,560 --> 01:31:34,719
board to try to take down the medical

2106
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:36,960
medium Community it has been really

2107
01:31:34,719 --> 01:31:39,400
upsetting to see this story evolve after

2108
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:42,000
seeing Ashley tell her healing story at

2109
01:31:39,400 --> 01:31:43,600
the medical medium live event I know

2110
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:46,199
some of you remember it or you remember

2111
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:50,840
hearing about it Ashley herself was

2112
01:31:46,199 --> 01:31:53,199
suffering and I mean really suffering

2113
01:31:50,840 --> 01:31:56,280
and hearing her words firsthand and

2114
01:31:53,199 --> 01:31:59,360
seeing her life turn around and now for

2115
01:31:56,280 --> 01:32:02,280
her to do this it doesn't make much

2116
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:04,760
sense to me the very information that

2117
01:32:02,280 --> 01:32:08,239
saved her life and these are her words

2118
01:32:04,760 --> 01:32:10,800
not mine and saved my life and several

2119
01:32:08,239 --> 01:32:13,840
of the other practitioners were

2120
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:16,760
plotters and now to twist it and to

2121
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:21,320
trash it and to manipulate it into an

2122
01:32:16,760 --> 01:32:25,000
article and into an agenda is just

2123
01:32:21,320 --> 01:32:28,360
upsetting she has been trying so hard to

2124
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:30,800
convince everyone out there of things

2125
01:32:28,360 --> 01:32:33,239
that are simply not true about Anthony

2126
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:34,920
and about this situation she tried to

2127
01:32:33,239 --> 01:32:37,920
Corner me and make me believe things

2128
01:32:34,920 --> 01:32:40,320
that are not true Anthony saved my life

2129
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:42,239
and I've watched thousands of Miracles

2130
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:45,320
over the years thanks to this

2131
01:32:42,239 --> 01:32:48,639
information there is such a clear agenda

2132
01:32:45,320 --> 01:32:50,440
here and I actually feel really bad for

2133
01:32:48,639 --> 01:32:53,360
everyone who has been swallowed up by

2134
01:32:50,440 --> 01:32:56,560
this so many of them have been saved by

2135
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:59,719
this same information thanks to Anthony

2136
01:32:56,560 --> 01:33:02,639
and I know very personally that he has

2137
01:32:59,719 --> 01:33:07,040
helped most of these plotters some of

2138
01:33:02,639 --> 01:33:10,639
them in their Darkest Hour even after

2139
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:13,159
Stephanie's death even when they have

2140
01:33:10,639 --> 01:33:16,760
walked away from the information but

2141
01:33:13,159 --> 01:33:16,760
that just tells you who Anthony

2142
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:20,360
is

2143
01:33:18,520 --> 01:33:24,239
yeah

2144
01:33:20,360 --> 01:33:27,520
wow I just have to say how sorry I am

2145
01:33:24,239 --> 01:33:29,560
again that Ashley targeted you and your

2146
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:32,040
family came the way that she did in so

2147
01:33:29,560 --> 01:33:33,239
many different instances she clearly

2148
01:33:32,040 --> 01:33:36,080
didn't know the facts about the

2149
01:33:33,239 --> 01:33:39,000
Stephanie story she just felt entitled

2150
01:33:36,080 --> 01:33:41,239
apparently to say whatever she wanted

2151
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:43,440
she said herself in her text to you that

2152
01:33:41,239 --> 01:33:45,280
she didn't care about any of the people

2153
01:33:43,440 --> 01:33:49,239
in the medical medium Community who she

2154
01:33:45,280 --> 01:33:51,840
hurt with her 2020 posts if Ashley had

2155
01:33:49,239 --> 01:33:53,840
genuine questions or concerns about what

2156
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:56,600
had happened with Stephanie if she had

2157
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:58,000
any real interest in pursuing the truth

2158
01:33:56,600 --> 01:34:00,920
she could have asked Anthony about

2159
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:04,679
anything she never did she could have

2160
01:34:00,920 --> 01:34:08,159
asked you she never did she decided to

2161
01:34:04,679 --> 01:34:10,119
take it public only a few months after

2162
01:34:08,159 --> 01:34:12,280
still trying to sell the medical medium

2163
01:34:10,119 --> 01:34:15,679
community on her self-proclaimed

2164
01:34:12,280 --> 01:34:18,600
expensive Retreats with celery juice and

2165
01:34:15,679 --> 01:34:21,239
a weight loss plan she tried to act like

2166
01:34:18,600 --> 01:34:24,360
some kind of hero or whistleblower when

2167
01:34:21,239 --> 01:34:26,760
she used a completely false story Ashley

2168
01:34:24,360 --> 01:34:29,679
exploited Stephanie and her private

2169
01:34:26,760 --> 01:34:33,000
information which is the saddest part

2170
01:34:29,679 --> 01:34:34,880
yeah she caused outrage and Chaos in the

2171
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:37,560
medical medium Community with her false

2172
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:39,520
stories she put you and others in a

2173
01:34:37,560 --> 01:34:41,880
situation where you'd have to defend the

2174
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:43,719
truth and then she had the nerve to

2175
01:34:41,880 --> 01:34:46,520
attack you for

2176
01:34:43,719 --> 01:34:48,920
it yeah she attacked my family my

2177
01:34:46,520 --> 01:34:50,560
children my profession and I just want

2178
01:34:48,920 --> 01:34:53,800
to talk about her weight loss book for a

2179
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:55,960
second twisting the information and

2180
01:34:53,800 --> 01:34:59,080
claiming to be an expert Beyond

2181
01:34:55,960 --> 01:35:00,840
Anthony's books I don't quite understand

2182
01:34:59,080 --> 01:35:04,560
it Amber but I can tell you that it

2183
01:35:00,840 --> 01:35:07,719
confused a lot of people Ashley's ebook

2184
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:10,480
was targeting postpartum women and it

2185
01:35:07,719 --> 01:35:14,159
was a weight loss plan with portion

2186
01:35:10,480 --> 01:35:16,080
sizes in ounce amounts I consulted with

2187
01:35:14,159 --> 01:35:18,960
a lot of postpartum women who were

2188
01:35:16,080 --> 01:35:21,000
influenced by Ashley's ebook to eat less

2189
01:35:18,960 --> 01:35:24,040
food and restrict their calories as a

2190
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:25,480
means of rapid weight loss they were

2191
01:35:24,040 --> 01:35:26,960
under the impression that they were

2192
01:35:25,480 --> 01:35:28,880
still following medical medium

2193
01:35:26,960 --> 01:35:32,119
information when medical medium

2194
01:35:28,880 --> 01:35:34,000
information does not restrict calories

2195
01:35:32,119 --> 01:35:35,360
they were just following Ashley's

2196
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:37,760
Twisted

2197
01:35:35,360 --> 01:35:39,920
information a lot of these women had

2198
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:41,760
their supply of breast milk drop because

2199
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:43,440
they were not eating enough and some of

2200
01:35:41,760 --> 01:35:45,679
them even blamed medical medium

2201
01:35:43,440 --> 01:35:47,679
information for that when it it wasn't

2202
01:35:45,679 --> 01:35:50,320
medical medium information it was

2203
01:35:47,679 --> 01:35:52,360
Ashley's portion controlled information

2204
01:35:50,320 --> 01:35:54,280
that she was marketing to the community

2205
01:35:52,360 --> 01:35:56,400
and it was so

2206
01:35:54,280 --> 01:36:00,000
irresponsible Ashley has done a lot of

2207
01:35:56,400 --> 01:36:03,520
damage I'm hurt I'm lost I'm traumatized

2208
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:07,119
by all of it and I just wanted to

2209
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:08,480
stop yeah yeah that's crazy that you've

2210
01:36:07,119 --> 01:36:12,960
had that you had those direct

2211
01:36:08,480 --> 01:36:16,000
experiences and uh with the impact that

2212
01:36:12,960 --> 01:36:19,280
Ashley's that her weight loss ebook had

2213
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:21,960
on women particularly postpartum women

2214
01:36:19,280 --> 01:36:24,239
in the community that's extremely sad

2215
01:36:21,960 --> 01:36:27,719
and Ashley really is the original of

2216
01:36:24,239 --> 01:36:30,360
twisting medical medium information and

2217
01:36:27,719 --> 01:36:33,600
um she's had a lot of influence on how

2218
01:36:30,360 --> 01:36:35,719
that's happened in more recent times

2219
01:36:33,600 --> 01:36:39,920
even you know with other people in other

2220
01:36:35,719 --> 01:36:42,679
cases and it's all really sad and Ashley

2221
01:36:39,920 --> 01:36:44,520
has indeed done a lot of damage and

2222
01:36:42,679 --> 01:36:46,719
that's why it's so important that we're

2223
01:36:44,520 --> 01:36:48,960
here you know to set the record straight

2224
01:36:46,719 --> 01:36:52,159
to help stop Ashley and the plotters

2225
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:54,159
from misleading deceiving hurting or

2226
01:36:52,159 --> 01:36:56,600
taking the chance to heal away

2227
01:36:54,159 --> 01:36:58,199
from anyone else so thank you very much

2228
01:36:56,600 --> 01:37:00,000
Kim for coming on I know that you're a

2229
01:36:58,199 --> 01:37:02,280
busy mom of three little ones and that

2230
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:03,719
this wasn't easy to do I really

2231
01:37:02,280 --> 01:37:05,440
appreciate you being here and sharing a

2232
01:37:03,719 --> 01:37:08,119
lot of these really difficult

2233
01:37:05,440 --> 01:37:11,400
experiences and I appreciate both of you

2234
01:37:08,119 --> 01:37:14,040
very much it's unfortunate that we had

2235
01:37:11,400 --> 01:37:16,360
to get together for something like this

2236
01:37:14,040 --> 01:37:19,360
setting the record straight I'm sure the

2237
01:37:16,360 --> 01:37:21,480
medical medium community and anyone even

2238
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:23,560
outside of the medical medium Community

2239
01:37:21,480 --> 01:37:25,960
truly appreciates your caring and

2240
01:37:23,560 --> 01:37:28,520
willingness to get the truth out there

2241
01:37:25,960 --> 01:37:30,000
thank you Kim thank you guys I

2242
01:37:28,520 --> 01:37:33,320
appreciate you

2243
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:35,960
both thanks

2244
01:37:33,320 --> 01:37:38,440
than as we are in the process of

2245
01:37:35,960 --> 01:37:40,400
exposing Ashley and her organized

2246
01:37:38,440 --> 01:37:42,840
hateful group for who and what they

2247
01:37:40,400 --> 01:37:44,800
really are it's important to take note

2248
01:37:42,840 --> 01:37:47,280
of their tactics and patterns that are

2249
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:49,719
likely to follow the plotters have a

2250
01:37:47,280 --> 01:37:52,800
documented history of initiating attacks

2251
01:37:49,719 --> 01:37:55,119
using lies and misinformation and then

2252
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:58,199
upon getting called out and corrected

2253
01:37:55,119 --> 01:38:00,840
trying to flip it and play victim that

2254
01:37:58,199 --> 01:38:03,400
is not going to work here all this group

2255
01:38:00,840 --> 01:38:05,639
has done is spread verifiable lies and

2256
01:38:03,400 --> 01:38:08,320
falsities they've carelessly attacked

2257
01:38:05,639 --> 01:38:10,440
and harmed many innocent people they've

2258
01:38:08,320 --> 01:38:12,199
used and exploited deceased individuals

2259
01:38:10,440 --> 01:38:14,920
and others in the process of trying to

2260
01:38:12,199 --> 01:38:17,520
get what they want they've repeatedly

2261
01:38:14,920 --> 01:38:19,400
explicitly expressed the intent to harm

2262
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:21,119
medical medium and they've even

2263
01:38:19,400 --> 01:38:23,199
deliberately tried to stop Anthony from

2264
01:38:21,119 --> 01:38:26,000
doing a free event to support and raise

2265
01:38:23,199 --> 01:38:28,159
money for the community we have every

2266
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:30,639
right to set the record straight and to

2267
01:38:28,159 --> 01:38:32,520
defend the truth with facts and evidence

2268
01:38:30,639 --> 01:38:34,080
and to defend the chronically ill

2269
01:38:32,520 --> 01:38:36,880
against the malicious attacks of this

2270
01:38:34,080 --> 01:38:40,320
group and we are going to continue to do

2271
01:38:36,880 --> 01:38:43,040
so we expect the plotters to evade and

2272
01:38:40,320 --> 01:38:44,920
ignore what they have done wrong we

2273
01:38:43,040 --> 01:38:47,880
expect them to continue to lie and

2274
01:38:44,920 --> 01:38:50,840
spread falsities we expect them to Pivot

2275
01:38:47,880 --> 01:38:54,040
onto something new they'll make up and

2276
01:38:50,840 --> 01:38:57,000
we expect them to skew and alter d data

2277
01:38:54,040 --> 01:38:59,719
and to hide critical pieces of evidence

2278
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:02,719
that undermines their entire campaign we

2279
01:38:59,719 --> 01:39:05,040
also expect the plotters to fabricate

2280
01:39:02,719 --> 01:39:07,000
explanations as they do everything they

2281
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:10,040
can to try to discredit what we're

2282
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:13,599
exposing them for having done and said

2283
01:39:10,040 --> 01:39:16,400
in their own words but we are using

2284
01:39:13,599 --> 01:39:20,159
their own text messages voice messages

2285
01:39:16,400 --> 01:39:22,480
social media posts words that they spoke

2286
01:39:20,159 --> 01:39:25,760
on recorded calls and other published

2287
01:39:22,480 --> 01:39:29,199
materials there's no use of any AI in

2288
01:39:25,760 --> 01:39:31,560
any of these episodes and never will be

2289
01:39:29,199 --> 01:39:34,560
