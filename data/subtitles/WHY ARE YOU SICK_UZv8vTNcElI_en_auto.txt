[0.24 - 5.28] right why does anybody get sick like why
[3.04 - 7.44] should anybody get sick
[5.28 - 10.32] shouldn't we
[7.44 - 13.04] be born
[10.32 - 13.04] we grow
[13.68 - 20.16] we stay strong
[17.04 - 23.52] and then we die in our sleep
[20.16 - 25.12] 99 years old to 110 years old or
[23.52 - 27.20] whatever
[25.12 - 28.56] shouldn't that be what should be right
[27.20 - 31.20] but wait
[28.56 - 32.80] it's not like that
[31.20 - 35.44] it was
[32.80 - 37.28] almost like that
[35.44 - 41.76] almost
[37.28 - 41.76] 30 years ago now how's that possible
[42.16 - 45.92] the
[42.84 - 46.80] elder homes
[45.92 - 52.16] right
[46.80 - 54.96] had people 98 105 109.
[52.16 - 56.24] technology wasn't great
[54.96 - 58.40] heart heart
[56.24 - 60.24] operations heart surgeries were
[58.40 - 62.40] antiquated
[60.24 - 65.92] right
[62.40 - 68.96] you name it medical technology
[65.92 - 71.12] mri scans were really bad antiquated
[68.96 - 74.48] everything was antiquated 30 years ago
[71.12 - 76.80] 35 years ago why was it when you go into
[74.48 - 80.16] a nursing home
[76.80 - 83.12] or retirement home that person's 105
[80.16 - 90.80] that person's 108 that person's 106.
[83.12 - 92.72] that person 35 years ago 106 108 104 99
[90.80 - 95.20] right
[92.72 - 98.64] you know what nursing homes have now
[95.20 - 102.56] if you can't be nursed at home
[98.64 - 107.04] 45 years old 42 years old 55 years old
[102.56 - 110.96] 30 years old 27 years old 22 years old
[107.04 - 113.68] 61 years old yep bedridden 65 years old
[110.96 - 115.12] bedridden 27 year old bedridden that's
[113.68 - 118.08] what it is now
[115.12 - 121.36] 35 years old 35 years ago you wouldn't
[118.08 - 124.00] find a 35 year old 35 years old 35 years
[121.36 - 126.24] ago you wouldn't find a 25 year old you
[124.00 - 129.68] didn't find a 20 year old that was
[126.24 - 132.08] basically wasting away
[129.68 - 135.04] it was rare they were there but it was
[132.08 - 137.36] so rare it was sprinkled in different
[135.04 - 139.76] parts of the country sprinkled around in
[137.36 - 142.40] different parts of the states
[139.76 - 145.76] but now that's changed
[142.40 - 149.68] life expectancy has dropped
[145.76 - 152.24] dropped tragically dropped
[149.68 - 153.92] that's how it is now
[152.24 - 156.88] it's not about
[153.92 - 158.64] you grow up you
[156.88 - 160.56] ebb and flow with a couple little
[158.64 - 163.36] sicknesses boom you're back on top
[160.56 - 165.92] you're strong you live your life
[163.36 - 168.16] now you're 65 now you're 75 now you're
[165.92 - 171.36] 85 and it's just your joints freak a
[168.16 - 173.12] little bit i'm 85 years old and
[171.36 - 174.96] yeah i'm a little stiff but i'm still
[173.12 - 177.04] playing a little bit of tennis
[174.96 - 179.12] and i still enjoy whatever i want to eat
[177.04 - 180.80] for lunch and drink whatever drink i
[179.12 - 183.44] want to have i put a little rum in here
[180.80 - 185.20] i just drink whatever i'm 85 years old
[183.44 - 188.24] nothing wrong
[185.20 - 191.28] and you know it it's not like that
[188.24 - 193.44] anymore we don't have that anymore
[191.28 - 197.52] it's a whole different story so why are
[193.44 - 198.80] we sick why are we all getting sick
[197.52 - 200.88] and
[198.80 - 202.56] that's the answer that's the question
[200.88 - 204.08] what's the answer
[202.56 - 205.60] why are we all sick so
[204.08 - 207.20] what happens is with medical medium
[205.60 - 209.28] information it's all about about the
[207.20 - 211.36] truth of why we're sick that's why when
[209.28 - 212.80] you go all the way back
[211.36 - 214.88] years ago with medical medium
[212.80 - 216.40] information people all walks of life
[214.88 - 219.84] sick traveling around the world looking
[216.40 - 221.68] for doctors 10 doctors 20 30 doctors
[219.84 - 224.00] and they were looking for this
[221.68 - 226.64] information right here
[224.00 - 228.32] they were looking for this information
[226.64 - 230.72] and then when they healed when they got
[228.32 - 233.12] the information they said write a book
[230.72 - 235.92] anthony write a book
[233.12 - 237.44] a w write a book mr medical medium write
[235.92 - 240.08] a book write a book write a book we
[237.44 - 242.16] heard it so many times
[240.08 - 245.84] i remember my receptionist heard it a
[242.16 - 248.72] billion times year after year after year
[245.84 - 250.72] as people left the office healing and
[248.72 - 251.84] more people healed and more people
[250.72 - 253.52] healed anthony when are you going to
[251.84 - 254.64] write the book doctors anthony when are
[253.52 - 256.24] you going to write the books what are
[254.64 - 257.68] you going to write the books
[256.24 - 259.92] when are you going to give the answers
[257.68 - 262.16] out there somehow you lecture you talk
[259.92 - 263.52] about it you lecture on the scene you go
[262.16 - 264.72] here you teach doctors when are you
[263.52 - 265.84] going to write the books and put it in
[264.72 - 269.04] the books
[265.84 - 270.24] the answers to why everybody said
[269.04 - 272.08] science and research didn't know the
[270.24 - 273.36] answers
[272.08 - 276.88] right so
[273.36 - 278.40] the whole point is is it's not like life
[276.88 - 281.36] used to be
[278.40 - 283.28] where you can get rid of a little bit of
[281.36 - 285.28] butter and you can get rid of a little
[283.28 - 288.00] bit of gluten and boom you're back on
[285.28 - 290.56] track and you're 75 years old and all's
[288.00 - 292.40] good your tip top shape those days are
[290.56 - 294.08] over now people are suffering and
[292.40 - 296.24] struggling and nobody knows what it's
[294.08 - 298.48] like to be in somebody's shoes man
[296.24 - 300.24] especially when you're young when you're
[298.48 - 301.52] young and you got the anxiety and it's
[300.24 - 303.36] through the roof you've got the
[301.52 - 305.68] depression and it's through the roof and
[303.36 - 307.28] you're really sick and struggling nobody
[305.68 - 309.36] knows
[307.28 - 313.44] what it's like when you when you're like
[309.36 - 314.80] 22 25 28 18
[313.44 - 316.64] whatever
[314.80 - 318.64] and nobody nobody knows what it's like
[316.64 - 320.16] any even when you're in your 30s and 40s
[318.64 - 321.52] and 50s and been through hell and back
[320.16 - 323.52] and you're struggling
[321.52 - 325.52] and you got more you got the hashimoto's
[323.52 - 327.76] but you got more that brain fog is
[325.52 - 329.84] brutal your brain fog is brutal you got
[327.76 - 332.00] the anxiety attacks and panic attacks
[329.84 - 333.28] then you got the depression you can't
[332.00 - 335.04] breathe good and you're at every
[333.28 - 336.48] pulmonologist and you're trying to
[335.04 - 337.92] figure out what's wrong with the lungs
[336.48 - 340.56] pulmonologists are saying fine your
[337.92 - 343.04] lungs are fine your lungs are fine
[340.56 - 345.12] and you can't breathe right
[343.04 - 347.52] jamie lee says i'm currently 25 so
[345.12 - 350.56] you're currently 25 and struggling
[347.52 - 350.56] it's really difficult
[350.80 - 354.80] god bless you for just keeping strong
[352.72 - 357.12] through it and probably fighting every
[354.80 - 360.32] day to get through it right
[357.12 - 362.24] i'm proud of you i truly am and
[360.32 - 363.44] and then so many people have so many
[362.24 - 365.28] different conditions and they have all
[363.44 - 367.68] the weight gain come on and then they
[365.28 - 370.80] have other things too it's not just a
[367.68 - 372.96] heart condition anymore it's not just
[370.80 - 374.56] you get old you have a prostate or a guy
[372.96 - 377.60] you got a prostate condition and then
[374.56 - 379.28] you get a heart condition
[377.60 - 380.80] or you're a woman and you get you get
[379.28 - 382.00] some other could do okay you get some
[380.80 - 384.16] other condition but the point like
[382.00 - 386.24] depression or some anxiety it's not that
[384.16 - 388.16] anymore it's far worse
[386.24 - 389.68] it's vast
[388.16 - 391.84] everybody's getting a neurological
[389.68 - 394.72] symptom left and right everybody has
[391.84 - 396.88] these neurological symptoms their brain
[394.72 - 399.36] is a big part of it ashley barnes says
[396.88 - 400.40] this man changed my life a monitor here

[422.48 - 427.60] we can break it down to some kind of
[425.04 - 432.72] simplistic level
[427.60 - 434.16] you either have something toxic in you
[432.72 - 437.36] or you have
[434.16 - 439.84] something alive in you that shouldn't be
[437.36 - 442.48] in you
[439.84 - 445.12] you either have
[442.48 - 446.56] something toxic in you right
[445.12 - 448.00] okay

[475.12 - 479.92] bracelet here and god i hear copper is
[477.76 - 482.08] so healthy for you by the way it's not
[479.92 - 483.52] copper's highly toxic
[482.08 - 486.08] and they're just they're just playing
[483.52 - 487.76] with fire when they play with copper
[486.08 - 489.12] touching it is really bad touching
[487.76 - 491.12] copper is bad
[489.12 - 492.48] right there i have to do my heavy metal
[491.12 - 493.92] detox smoothie tomorrow morning you
[492.48 - 494.96] better believe it
[493.92 - 496.72] so
[494.96 - 499.28] we're either
[496.72 - 501.28] saturated with some kind of toxin
[499.28 - 503.28] whether it's metals whether it's
[501.28 - 505.36] chemicals
[503.28 - 507.84] right for old pharmaceuticals but we're
[505.36 - 509.04] saturated with either that
[507.84 - 511.44] or
[509.04 - 514.24] we got the bugs we got some things
[511.44 - 517.28] inside of us alive that's not supposed
[514.24 - 518.72] to be there alive it's not supposed to
[517.28 - 522.16] be there
[518.72 - 526.16] but it's there and then
[522.16 - 529.36] having both having both toxins
[526.16 - 530.64] and the bugs combined is even harder on
[529.36 - 533.36] people
[530.64 - 536.56] monica says i just lost my beloved hubby
[533.36 - 538.48] he was 33 he was so sick

[550.80 - 555.68] somewhere somehow you can find some
[552.72 - 555.68] peace through all this
[556.40 - 560.72] what happens is people have two things
[558.96 - 563.68] going on they have the poisons and the
[560.72 - 564.80] toxins or they got the bugs they got the
[563.68 - 568.16] critters

[753.44 - 756.40] cause anxiety
[756.84 - 762.64] okay what's happening here is
[760.80 - 765.36] published in the medical medium books
[762.64 - 768.56] quite a long time ago now
[765.36 - 771.12] uh kim d'andrea says you cured my son
[768.56 - 773.60] from hypothyroidism on facebook
[771.12 - 775.04] incredible incredible
[773.60 - 776.64] medical medium information is so
[775.04 - 778.40] advanced and so ahead of research in
[776.64 - 781.84] science that research and science ends
[778.40 - 783.60] up stealing it years later
[781.84 - 785.12] but the jokes on research and science
[783.60 - 787.84] we're stealing it because it's already
[785.12 - 787.84] been published
[788.08 - 791.52] and
[789.60 - 794.00] it's already here
[791.52 - 796.72] way before as proof
[794.00 - 797.84] that another source up above
[796.72 - 799.52] a source
[797.84 - 800.64] had the answers before research in
[799.52 - 801.68] science
[800.64 - 803.36] so what they're doing they're taking
[801.68 - 804.88] medical media information now about
[803.36 - 806.56] epstein-barr and a lot of other things
[804.88 - 808.08] is actually insane what they're doing
[806.56 - 810.96] they used to say
[808.08 - 812.80] this disease or condition cause unknown
[810.96 - 814.32] and now they put viral infection now
[812.80 - 815.92] they put epstein-barr now they put
[814.32 - 817.28] shingles it's like okay but where's the
[815.92 - 819.04] research paper and you look there is no
[817.28 - 821.28] research paper and then you look there
[819.04 - 823.36] really is no research that was done then
[821.28 - 825.28] you realize it's just somebody
[823.36 - 826.88] going like this
[825.28 - 828.48] whoa
[826.88 - 829.84] that guy sold millions and millions and
[828.48 - 831.76] millions of books
[829.84 - 833.36] talking about epstein-barr doctors are
[831.76 - 835.12] using it all around the world we can't
[833.36 - 836.88] let this guy get away with this we
[835.12 - 839.20] better just take it and steal it doesn't
[836.88 - 842.32] matter if we don't have research yet
[839.20 - 844.88] yeah our a is now epstein-barr ms is now
[842.32 - 847.76] epstein-barr with no real research
[844.88 - 849.92] behind it interesting
[847.76 - 851.60] so when it comes down to being sick
[849.92 - 853.68] there's real reasons i've been saying
[851.60 - 854.84] this for over 35 years
[853.68 - 856.48] if you have
[854.84 - 858.56] vertigo
[856.48 - 862.24] it's the vagus nerves it's the vagus
[858.56 - 863.76] nerves being inflamed by a critter you
[862.24 - 865.60] got tinnitus
[863.76 - 868.08] it's a critter getting into the
[865.60 - 870.48] labyrinth of the inner ear
[868.08 - 872.72] and inflaming that nerve channel causing
[870.48 - 874.96] your tinnitus you're popping you're
[872.72 - 878.32] fluttering you're washing
[874.96 - 879.68] viral infection right
[878.32 - 880.88] if you've got other conditions like
[879.68 - 883.92] eczema
[880.88 - 886.56] and psoriasis that's a combination of
[883.92 - 888.40] having toxic heavy metals like copper
[886.56 - 889.84] inside your liver
[888.40 - 892.40] and then having
[889.84 - 894.16] a little buggy right here that feeds off
[892.40 - 896.56] of the copper because that's what
[894.16 - 898.56] happens to little bugs inside of a speed
[896.56 - 901.28] feeds off the copper releases a
[898.56 - 904.88] dermatoxin and now you have your skin
[901.28 - 906.72] problems your psoriasis and eczema
[904.88 - 908.32] if this is really hard for someone to
[906.72 - 909.84] understand because it could be hard for
[908.32 - 912.40] somebody to understand when you think
[909.84 - 913.92] about it right if it is you just gotta
[912.40 - 916.00] break it down you gotta break break it
[913.92 - 918.56] down it's the most simplest form
[916.00 - 921.20] you got a critter in you
[918.56 - 922.96] and you got some poisons and toxins of
[921.20 - 926.16] some kind in you
[922.96 - 928.96] you can name them all right
[926.16 - 931.84] and one is bothering you
[928.96 - 931.84] on its own
[932.48 - 936.88] or
[933.44 - 939.12] both of them are bothering you together
[936.88 - 942.56] that is as simple as it gets and then
[939.12 - 946.16] ready after that
[942.56 - 950.56] our immune systems break down
[946.16 - 953.44] we become deficient dehydrated
[950.56 - 953.44] and toxic
[953.52 - 958.00] and then we just start to fall apart as
[956.48 - 960.40] the years go on
[958.00 - 962.00] i can sum it up that easy
[960.40 - 964.32] that fast
[962.00 - 967.04] for anyone
[964.32 - 968.96] and if i heard that and i was sick so if
[967.04 - 970.56] i had something wrong and i was in bad
[968.96 - 972.64] shape and i heard that be like what do i
[970.56 - 974.48] need to do
[972.64 - 976.64] it sounds to me like i have to get rid
[974.48 - 978.72] of the critters
[976.64 - 980.16] find out which ones
[978.72 - 982.48] and then i got to figure out how to get
[980.16 - 984.56] rid of the poisons and the toxins like
[982.48 - 987.20] the metals or anything else
[984.56 - 990.40] and then i'm home free
[987.20 - 990.40] but how am i going to do that
[990.80 - 994.16] answers are here
[992.40 - 997.04] it's doable
[994.16 - 998.40] people are doing it all around the world
[997.04 - 1000.24] they are
[998.40 - 1002.00] so let's go into a little bit
[1000.24 - 1004.88] now now
[1002.00 - 1009.12] if i was sick okay
[1004.88 - 1011.36] i'd be drinking licorice tea if i had
[1009.12 - 1012.80] symptoms
[1011.36 - 1015.44] that were
[1012.80 - 1018.00] looking like
[1015.44 - 1019.44] they were because of epstein-barr or
[1018.00 - 1021.28] shingles
[1019.44 - 1024.48] and those symptoms are
[1021.28 - 1026.48] fatigue conditions like lupus chronic
[1024.48 - 1028.72] fatigue syndrome
[1026.48 - 1031.20] brain fog right
[1028.72 - 1033.04] autoimmune of any kind and so i'd be
[1031.20 - 1037.28] like okay licorice tea
[1033.04 - 1038.88] because that's an antiviral right there
[1037.28 - 1040.32] even if you're doing little things like
[1038.88 - 1042.08] this well i'm going to do my licorice
[1040.32 - 1045.20] tea that's one thing right there so i'm
[1042.08 - 1047.76] going to go into auto immune right now
[1045.20 - 1050.08] and i'm going to look forward here
[1047.76 - 1050.08] right
[1050.24 - 1055.84] and
[1052.88 - 1057.92] so let's go to autoimmune
[1055.84 - 1060.16] so autoimmune diseases and disorders
[1057.92 - 1062.16] right so if you get diagnosed with an
[1060.16 - 1064.32] autoimmune disease and i'm going to read
[1062.16 - 1066.56] real quick the autoimmune part right
[1064.32 - 1068.32] if your individual autoimmune
[1066.56 - 1070.72] issue isn't listed here because there's
[1068.32 - 1072.24] so many there's hundreds right
[1070.72 - 1074.56] if it's not listed here you still can
[1072.24 - 1077.60] use this autoimmune section by the way
[1074.56 - 1079.76] the true cause of autoimmune is unknown
[1077.60 - 1082.32] to medical research and science health
[1079.76 - 1085.28] problems that are labeled autoimmune are
[1082.32 - 1087.44] in truth viral infections viruses that
[1085.28 - 1088.96] cause autoimmune conditions can be one
[1087.44 - 1092.08] or more
[1088.96 - 1094.88] of the 60 varieties of epstein-barr
[1092.08 - 1095.68] over 30 varieties of shingles
[1094.88 - 1099.44] okay
[1095.68 - 1103.04] many varieties of hhv-6 hhv-7
[1099.44 - 1105.52] undiscovered hhv-10 through hhv-16
[1103.04 - 1107.84] multiple varieties of herpes simplex
[1105.52 - 1110.32] ones so the fever blister people got the
[1107.84 - 1112.24] fever blister in their body their whole
[1110.32 - 1114.24] life but then what happens is the fever
[1112.24 - 1115.84] blister virus you guys
[1114.24 - 1119.12] ends up
[1115.84 - 1122.48] causing jaw pain teeth pain
[1119.12 - 1124.96] strange headaches back to the neck right
[1122.48 - 1126.64] trigeminal neuralgia other problems so
[1124.96 - 1129.36] that's what happens with the herpes
[1126.64 - 1131.28] simplex viruses herpes simplex one cold
[1129.36 - 1132.48] store fever blister i just got a fever
[1131.28 - 1134.08] blister
[1132.48 - 1136.72] yeah don't worry don't worry yeah what
[1134.08 - 1139.12] do you see on my lip don't worry
[1136.72 - 1140.56] it's just a fever blister is what it is
[1139.12 - 1142.08] and that's what people don't realize
[1140.56 - 1143.68] it's like oh no it's no big deal
[1142.08 - 1145.36] meanwhile you know it is a big deal
[1143.68 - 1147.12] because in the end it can cause some
[1145.36 - 1149.92] problems and it's important to kind of
[1147.12 - 1151.04] like be like open to that it's like it's
[1149.92 - 1153.28] like
[1151.04 - 1155.52] yeah i know i have a fever blister don't
[1153.28 - 1157.68] worry about it
[1155.52 - 1159.36] you want to share my glass i'll share my
[1157.68 - 1161.04] glass with you right
[1159.36 - 1162.48] it's like yeah no can i borrow that i'll
[1161.04 - 1164.08] give you your glass back can i try that
[1162.48 - 1166.16] drink don't worry about this fever
[1164.08 - 1168.32] blister right now yeah don't worry the
[1166.16 - 1170.80] fever blisters are highly contagious
[1168.32 - 1172.56] right highly contagious
[1170.80 - 1174.72] and
[1172.56 - 1176.40] and they cause so many troubles but
[1174.72 - 1179.84] people don't know they cause any trouble
[1176.40 - 1179.84] so it's like okay no don't worry
[1180.00 - 1182.80] we have
[1180.88 - 1184.88] doctor says my child's fine my child has
[1182.80 - 1186.80] a fever blister
[1184.88 - 1187.92] obviously came from me the parent and
[1186.80 - 1189.36] the parents
[1187.92 - 1190.96] but you know no one talks about it the
[1189.36 - 1193.20] doctor says it's perfectly fine it goes
[1190.96 - 1194.80] away meanwhile it means early trigeminal
[1193.20 - 1196.88] neuralgia unless you do something about
[1194.80 - 1198.64] it it means early migraines it means
[1196.88 - 1200.80] early symptoms it means all kinds of
[1198.64 - 1201.68] issues if you don't do something about
[1200.80 - 1204.24] it
[1201.68 - 1206.24] so in the autoimmune section right here
[1204.24 - 1208.80] okay
[1206.24 - 1211.44] i'm reading this the cause of autoimmune
[1208.80 - 1212.88] disorders and diseases
[1211.44 - 1215.12] right
[1212.88 - 1218.24] are not the body's immune system
[1215.12 - 1219.52] attacking its own organs and glands
[1218.24 - 1220.88] medical research and science you know
[1219.52 - 1222.72] what they did recently they took
[1220.88 - 1224.16] epstein-barr information from medical
[1222.72 - 1227.52] medium books
[1224.16 - 1228.32] word for word plagiarizing
[1227.52 - 1230.00] and
[1228.32 - 1231.76] but they still think the body's
[1230.00 - 1234.32] attacking itself too because they can't
[1231.76 - 1236.32] let that old theory go they're bringing
[1234.32 - 1239.12] in something fresh
[1236.32 - 1241.04] something that's solid and works like mm
[1239.12 - 1242.24] info about epstein-barr causing all
[1241.04 - 1243.52] these symptoms and conditions and then
[1242.24 - 1245.12] they mix it
[1243.52 - 1247.92] they just can't help themselves they
[1245.12 - 1249.52] mismix it with the ah the body attacks
[1247.92 - 1251.28] itself with it
[1249.52 - 1252.56] it's ridiculous really they can't keep
[1251.28 - 1254.40] it straight there's no consistency
[1252.56 - 1256.16] there's no check and balance
[1254.40 - 1257.44] they constantly contradict itself you
[1256.16 - 1259.36] notice how that's the world right now
[1257.44 - 1261.44] it's nothing but contradictions 24 7.
[1259.36 - 1264.00] there's no check and balance
[1261.44 - 1265.44] right medical medium science
[1264.00 - 1267.28] is what they're using so they're using
[1265.44 - 1269.68] medical medium science
[1267.28 - 1271.04] so it's a theory that the body attacks
[1269.68 - 1272.80] itself right and that's what the
[1271.04 - 1275.12] industry always uses started from the
[1272.80 - 1277.28] 1950s
[1275.12 - 1279.12] the truth is though
[1277.28 - 1281.28] people are dealing with viruses
[1279.12 - 1283.36] responsible for these illnesses that are
[1281.28 - 1285.52] they're living with viral activity in a
[1283.36 - 1286.80] combination with toxic metals and other
[1285.52 - 1289.44] chemicals
[1286.80 - 1291.92] these viruses feed on foods too that i
[1289.44 - 1296.40] always talk about
[1291.92 - 1299.12] if you want to weigh out if you want out
[1296.40 - 1300.80] do you want out yeah you want out no one
[1299.12 - 1302.56] wants to be sick you guys don't want to
[1300.80 - 1305.20] be sick i don't know anybody that wants
[1302.56 - 1306.64] to be sick
[1305.20 - 1308.00] i definitely don't know anybody that
[1306.64 - 1309.04] wants to be sick
[1308.00 - 1311.12] right
[1309.04 - 1312.80] but there's a way out
[1311.12 - 1314.32] there really is
[1312.80 - 1316.48] it's about learning about whoa wait a
[1314.32 - 1319.12] minute i can go after the bugs inside of
[1316.48 - 1321.28] me i can actually get the toxins out i
[1319.12 - 1324.72] could do something about it
[1321.28 - 1326.88] powerful that's powerful
[1324.72 - 1326.88] so
[1328.48 - 1332.96] if you have lupus if you've got ra if
[1330.80 - 1334.32] you've got anemia if you've got other
[1332.96 - 1336.40] conditions anything any kind of
[1334.32 - 1338.00] autoimmune condition
[1336.40 - 1340.96] someone's asking on tick-tock do you
[1338.00 - 1343.12] drink licorice tea the rest of the day
[1340.96 - 1344.80] look i'll go and i'll go in times where
[1343.12 - 1346.72] i'm drinking licorice tea to keep my
[1344.80 - 1349.92] immune system strong because i'm working
[1346.72 - 1352.00] a ton of hours if i get exposed to
[1349.92 - 1354.48] anyone or anything like that i like to
[1352.00 - 1355.68] keep my immune system nice and strong so
[1354.48 - 1357.20] what i'll do is i'll say you know what
[1355.68 - 1358.72] i'll do licorice tea for a while and if
[1357.20 - 1360.80] i can't find any licorice tea i don't
[1358.72 - 1362.96] have any licorice tea then i'll just get
[1360.80 - 1364.56] a licorice supplement right
[1362.96 - 1366.08] so i'll get a licorice supplement from
[1364.56 - 1368.00] vimergy right here
[1366.08 - 1369.84] and vimergy is that company i always
[1368.00 - 1371.28] talk about right i'm not sponsored by
[1369.84 - 1373.04] these guys here's their vitamin c but
[1371.28 - 1376.16] they got a licorice fruit
[1373.04 - 1378.24] vimergy's v is invector i am ergy dot
[1376.16 - 1379.92] com i'm not sponsored by those guys i
[1378.24 - 1382.08] don't own the company but the stuff is
[1379.92 - 1384.24] incredible at me says i thought you were
[1382.08 - 1385.84] doing amazon live i did the link is in
[1384.24 - 1386.84] the description so check it out you can
[1385.84 - 1389.20] watch the
[1386.84 - 1390.96] replay of the amazon latte we made
[1389.20 - 1392.64] spaghetti and meatballs
[1390.96 - 1394.16] so we made spaghetti and meatballs on
[1392.64 - 1395.60] the amazon live
[1394.16 - 1398.80] and the reason why it took such a long
[1395.60 - 1400.80] time was since i ate a bowl i ate a
[1398.80 - 1402.40] plate this big spaghetti and meatballs
[1400.80 - 1405.20] and i was like oh my god i can't go live
[1402.40 - 1407.20] yet i better just work on other projects
[1405.20 - 1409.52] i was stuffed i couldn't help it it was
[1407.20 - 1412.00] so good it was so good i had did this
[1409.52 - 1414.96] waffle garlic bread i made like i don't
[1412.00 - 1417.20] know 10 meatballs i had two pounds of
[1414.96 - 1419.20] pasta it was gluten-free pasta you guys
[1417.20 - 1422.00] gotta check the amazon live out it was
[1419.20 - 1425.20] fat free it was radical fat free
[1422.00 - 1427.28] it was it was it was really great
[1425.20 - 1429.12] you can drink the licorice
[1427.28 - 1431.60] sure ask your doctor of licorice if you
[1429.12 - 1433.28] can drink licorice tea but me personally
[1431.60 - 1435.04] yeah i'll drink it keep my immune system
[1433.28 - 1437.44] strong i'll drink it every day
[1435.04 - 1439.12] that's traditional medicinals that's i'm
[1437.44 - 1441.44] not sponsored either by these guys but
[1439.12 - 1443.20] this is the company i use for my teas
[1441.44 - 1444.96] right there traditional medicinals
[1443.20 - 1446.56] thought i'd have that on there because i
[1444.96 - 1449.28] don't talk about these guys that much
[1446.56 - 1451.44] even though i do when i can
[1449.28 - 1451.44] so
[1453.20 - 1458.56] um rosangela says the amount of times i
[1456.24 - 1460.48] heard that my body was attacking myself
[1458.56 - 1461.68] had me thinking something was wrong with
[1460.48 - 1463.44] me for years
[1461.68 - 1464.88] that's the way the system is built up
[1463.44 - 1465.84] it's on youtube thank you for being here
[1464.88 - 1467.76] rosa
[1465.84 - 1469.76] that's the way the system's built it's
[1467.76 - 1471.84] built to convince the person their
[1469.76 - 1473.68] bodies are faulty attacking themselves
[1471.84 - 1475.92] their bodies are no good
[1473.68 - 1477.84] and their body wants you dead because
[1475.92 - 1480.08] your body is attacking itself so that
[1477.84 - 1482.00] means your body wants you gone right if
[1480.08 - 1483.76] it's attacking you and making you sick
[1482.00 - 1485.76] to the point where you can't live life
[1483.76 - 1487.60] anymore then yeah maybe my body turned
[1485.76 - 1489.20] against me but that's not what happens
[1487.60 - 1490.32] has nothing to do with your body doing
[1489.20 - 1491.60] that
[1490.32 - 1492.96] it's about these little critters that
[1491.60 - 1494.88] everybody has inside of them and when
[1492.96 - 1496.48] you have autoimmune which everybody's
[1494.88 - 1498.64] getting a diagnosis of autonomy do you
[1496.48 - 1500.64] think that's normal
[1498.64 - 1502.96] because is that a normal great thing
[1500.64 - 1506.40] every single human being on this planet
[1502.96 - 1508.80] will get an autoimmune diagnosis
[1506.40 - 1512.16] every single one of them in the coming
[1508.80 - 1512.16] next 10 15 years
[1512.80 - 1516.80] maybe young people not as much but but
[1515.44 - 1519.04] most of them will still get an
[1516.80 - 1520.08] autoimmune diagnosis
[1519.04 - 1522.24] but
[1520.08 - 1523.92] everybody will have that label
[1522.24 - 1524.96] eventually have it if they get a little
[1523.92 - 1527.52] older i'm not talking about a little
[1524.96 - 1529.60] older like 90 years old i'm talking 30
[1527.52 - 1532.08] years old
[1529.60 - 1535.84] 35 years old every single person on the
[1532.08 - 1537.44] planet will have an autoimmune diagnosis
[1535.84 - 1542.28] everyone
[1537.44 - 1542.28] is that good is that normal

[1620.00 - 1622.96] disorders as well
[1621.84 - 1624.32] and then they're going to be diagnosed
[1622.96 - 1624.88] with all these autoimmune disorders
[1624.32 - 1626.40] because they're going to have
[1624.88 - 1628.00] neurological problems so where we're
[1626.40 - 1630.80] heading now is everybody's gonna have
[1628.00 - 1631.92] something wrong like a twitch a spasm a
[1630.80 - 1633.84] tick

[1647.92 - 1650.48] and
[1649.12 - 1652.56] that's what we're heading and then their

[1662.32 - 1666.64] planet
[1663.92 - 1668.07] and i don't think butter in your coffee
[1666.64 - 1669.92] or apple cider vinegar
[1668.07 - 1670.72] [Music]
[1669.92 - 1672.96] or

[1672.96 - 1676.32] or
[1674.64 - 1678.72] whatever

[1678.72 - 1681.28] not
[1679.60 - 1683.20] it never did
[1681.28 - 1685.44] and never will
[1683.20 - 1687.04] but there's so many newbies that are
[1685.44 - 1688.48] going to get autoimmune disease that all
[1687.04 - 1689.60] these conditions and symptoms and be
[1688.48 - 1690.96] suffering and struggling and they're

[1710.96 - 1714.08] year of suffering
[1712.72 - 1715.52] let's go through another two years
[1714.08 - 1718.08] another three years another four years
[1715.52 - 1720.08] before they'll ever know
[1718.08 - 1722.80] lisa said one year on celery juice and
[1720.08 - 1725.12] now cooking only with medical medium
[1722.80 - 1727.36] recipes and feeling so much more energy

[1728.72 - 1731.76] if you think i'm trying to push off a
[1730.40 - 1733.12] book
[1731.76 - 1734.72] sell a book
[1733.12 - 1737.20] go to the library and get it for free
[1734.72 - 1739.12] don't pay for it please i don't care if
[1737.20 - 1740.48] no one pays for it if you could go to
[1739.12 - 1742.88] the library
[1740.48 - 1745.12] and just take it out of the library
[1742.88 - 1746.64] that's all i care about if i know you're
[1745.12 - 1749.28] sitting at home and you're looking into
[1746.64 - 1751.76] this and you're like what
[1749.28 - 1753.36] i i can actually get better
[1751.76 - 1755.20] there's answers in here
[1753.36 - 1757.84] right
[1755.20 - 1760.40] so yeah important to know
[1757.84 - 1761.84] so let's talk about just a couple little
[1760.40 - 1763.12] the little nitty gritty i've talked
[1761.84 - 1764.56] about it before i'm going to talk about
[1763.12 - 1765.76] it again
[1764.56 - 1769.20] you have to be careful when you're
[1765.76 - 1772.80] getting your blood tests that's critical
[1769.20 - 1775.36] people don't stand a chance
[1772.80 - 1776.64] they don't stand a chance unless they
[1775.36 - 1779.68] learn
[1776.64 - 1782.32] to ask for half files from your doctor
[1779.68 - 1784.32] or quarter vials from your doctor if the
[1782.32 - 1785.44] phlebotomist says
[1784.32 - 1786.96] no
[1785.44 - 1789.04] we can't do it
[1786.96 - 1791.04] call your doctor and you tell them
[1789.04 - 1793.44] you're only going to give half files
[1791.04 - 1795.60] or quarter vials
[1793.44 - 1796.64] that's what you do
[1795.60 - 1799.76] and then the doctor will tell the
[1796.64 - 1801.60] phlebotomist just take the blood
[1799.76 - 1803.28] and then that blood will do the same
[1801.60 - 1804.48] thing any other blood will do because
[1803.28 - 1806.40] they only need
[1804.48 - 1807.84] a quarter or half file they need way
[1806.40 - 1810.32] less than that i talk about that all
[1807.84 - 1811.52] these years right
[1810.32 - 1812.88] one of the ways they're getting
[1811.52 - 1814.56] everybody right now and if i don't
[1812.88 - 1816.08] explain this to you guys once in a while
[1814.56 - 1818.56] you're just gonna fall into the traps
[1816.08 - 1821.04] there's a lot of new people here too
[1818.56 - 1822.72] they'll get you on the blood tests
[1821.04 - 1825.36] they'll take the vials from you and
[1822.72 - 1828.32] you'll lose your white count while
[1825.36 - 1829.60] your white count is trying to stop this
[1828.32 - 1832.08] right here
[1829.60 - 1834.56] so inside your body there's a war all
[1832.08 - 1836.24] the time you're sick you got the brain
[1834.56 - 1838.24]  you don't feel good you got
[1836.24 - 1840.16] symptoms you got conditions
[1838.24 - 1842.00] you're not well you got anxiety you got
[1840.16 - 1844.08] severe depression you got body pain
[1842.00 - 1845.44] you've got fatigue you've got all these
[1844.08 - 1846.88] different conditions you've got skin
[1845.44 - 1849.60] rashes you've got hives and what's
[1846.88 - 1852.80] happening is your white blood cells are
[1849.60 - 1856.08] trying to control and gobble down and
[1852.80 - 1856.08] eat the bugs
[1857.28 - 1860.48] and then you're going to your doctor
[1858.88 - 1862.08] because you feel so darn sick and your
[1860.48 - 1864.16] butt doctors can be like i need to look
[1862.08 - 1866.56] at all your profiles
[1864.16 - 1868.64] let's get all the profiles here
[1866.56 - 1870.32] i want to look at metabolic i want to
[1868.64 - 1872.08] look at everything
[1870.32 - 1874.72] and then you get i want a thyroid panel
[1872.08 - 1876.40] metabolic panel i want a nutrition panel
[1874.72 - 1877.12] i want to whatever and that's what they
[1876.40 - 1879.52] do
[1877.12 - 1882.72] and then what happens is your white
[1879.52 - 1885.68] blood cells are removed
[1882.72 - 1888.08] with every blood test with every vial
[1885.68 - 1890.40] but before they can restore which can
[1888.08 - 1891.44] take weeks and even months for many
[1890.40 - 1892.88] people because you already have an
[1891.44 - 1895.20] immune system problem because that's why
[1892.88 - 1898.08] you're at the doctor's office the bugs
[1895.20 - 1900.32] are still in the organs without your
[1898.08 - 1902.96] immune system in the blood anymore to
[1900.32 - 1904.88] keep it under control and you get sicker
[1902.96 - 1906.56] this is why people have lost their lives
[1904.88 - 1908.56] with neurological lyme multiple
[1906.56 - 1910.64] sclerosis and cancer in almost every
[1908.56 - 1913.36] other condition because they take and
[1910.64 - 1914.96] the more you get sick and complain the
[1913.36 - 1916.48] more blood they take and then the
[1914.96 - 1918.72] specialist takes and then the next
[1916.48 - 1920.24] specialist takes no one cares and then
[1918.72 - 1922.32] you're sick in the hospital and they
[1920.24 - 1924.32] take it every day
[1922.32 - 1925.20] until you lose your life
[1924.32 - 1927.92] or
[1925.20 - 1930.88] somehow end up home without a blood test
[1927.92 - 1933.60] long enough to regain your life back to
[1930.88 - 1937.76] sustain yourself enough before they try
[1933.60 - 1937.76] to draw your blood again and kill you
[1938.08 - 1943.20] this is not radical thinking
[1941.44 - 1945.04] i talk to doctors about this all the
[1943.20 - 1946.48] time i have doctors now reaching out to
[1945.04 - 1948.48] me saying that's the best thing they've
[1946.48 - 1950.08] ever heard their patients are rebounding
[1948.48 - 1951.76] quicker their patients are healing
[1950.08 - 1954.24] they're ordering quarter miles and half
[1951.76 - 1955.84] vials it's changing medicine right now
[1954.24 - 1958.72] but if you're not on board you're just
[1955.84 - 1961.20] gonna get ripped off
[1958.72 - 1962.48] yeah ripped off
[1961.20 - 1965.28] the one thing
[1962.48 - 1967.84] about the medical medium books
[1965.28 - 1969.68] is they teach you about this blood draw
[1967.84 - 1972.24] too that's one thing right there there's
[1969.68 - 1973.52] so many cool things right
[1972.24 - 1975.12] so
[1973.52 - 1977.84] there's a section in here there's a
[1975.12 - 1979.04] section in here about like where like
[1977.84 - 1979.92] that i'm going to show you in a minute
[1979.04 - 1983.76] too
[1979.92 - 1985.28] when it comes down to lyme disease right
[1983.76 - 1986.80] it comes down to lyme disease and i have
[1985.28 - 1990.56] a lime section in all my books there's a
[1986.80 - 1993.68] lime section in this book right here
[1990.56 - 1996.00] you can never heal from lyme disease
[1993.68 - 1998.16] unless you learn
[1996.00 - 2000.48] what you're after you got to go after
[1998.16 - 2002.48] the bugs and the right kind
[2000.48 - 2005.92] you have to go after the toxins and then
[2002.48 - 2008.48] you have to look out for the blood draws
[2005.92 - 2010.24] the blood frogs are a big part you know
[2008.48 - 2011.52] you know who heals with lyme disease
[2010.24 - 2012.72] when they start feeling a little better
[2011.52 - 2014.80] when they do the right things like the
[2012.72 - 2016.40] medical medium information and then
[2014.80 - 2017.60] they're they're going to the doctors a
[2016.40 - 2019.52] lot less
[2017.60 - 2021.60] and they're getting less blood drawn and
[2019.52 - 2023.68] now they're rocking now they're getting
[2021.60 - 2026.24] their lives back it's incredible it's
[2023.68 - 2026.24] incredible
[2026.48 - 2029.60] right
[2028.00 - 2031.20] so i got this little part here in this
[2029.60 - 2032.64] medical medium book one all the medical
[2031.20 - 2034.16] medium books are so loaded with
[2032.64 - 2034.96] information
[2034.16 - 2037.20] right
[2034.96 - 2039.20] when a larger number of blood vials are
[2037.20 - 2041.92] drawn it could be stressful on the
[2039.20 - 2044.40] immune system
[2041.92 - 2046.96] four full vials six full vials 20 full
[2044.40 - 2047.92] vials 34 miles right
[2046.96 - 2049.76] okay
[2047.92 - 2052.40] because the very immune defenses that
[2049.76 - 2054.48] are keeping the viruses behind lyme
[2052.40 - 2056.16] symptoms and any other symptom or
[2054.48 - 2058.08] autoimmune disease or anything else
[2056.16 - 2060.24] you're up against are being drawn out of
[2058.08 - 2062.16] the body when the blood is being drawn
[2060.24 - 2065.12] so your very defenses like your immune
[2062.16 - 2067.28] systems being sucked up and drawn up
[2065.12 - 2069.36] if you don't know how to ask for quarter
[2067.28 - 2072.32] vials and be cautious and be cautious on
[2069.36 - 2073.92] how much blood is being taken
[2072.32 - 2076.00] blood draws tend to take away a
[2073.92 - 2078.16] substantial portion of a person's immune
[2076.00 - 2079.68] system that day and it sometimes takes
[2078.16 - 2081.60] weeks to months to rebuild those
[2079.68 - 2083.12] portions of the immune system
[2081.60 - 2084.96] fancy that
[2083.12 - 2086.64] within those weeks
[2084.96 - 2089.20] that the full power of your immune
[2086.64 - 2091.44] system is not present anymore
[2089.20 - 2092.80] in your blood monitoring bugs and
[2091.44 - 2094.72] viruses
[2092.80 - 2096.88] there's a window of strength all the
[2094.72 - 2098.32] bugs get in that moment they rise up and
[2096.88 - 2100.40] now you're sicker and you're going to
[2098.32 - 2101.52] the doctor one more time and when you go
[2100.40 - 2103.36] to the doctor one more time you're
[2101.52 - 2105.52] getting blood drawn again darcey lee

[2209.52 - 2213.52] about that check out the podcast when
[2211.20 - 2214.88] you get a chance about donating blood
[2213.52 - 2216.72] and how that works
[2214.88 - 2218.40] okay so i'm not against blood donations
[2216.72 - 2221.68] but check it out
[2218.40 - 2223.76] definitely if you can't
[2221.68 - 2226.00] so when i talk about why are we sick i'm
[2223.76 - 2226.96] giving you guys the foundational tools
[2226.00 - 2229.44] right
[2226.96 - 2231.60] you got some kind of critter in you
[2229.44 - 2234.80] right we got a critter
[2231.60 - 2238.88] right i gave you that one we got toxins
[2234.80 - 2241.12] we got poisons right it's another one
[2238.88 - 2243.76] and then
[2241.12 - 2246.88] we get broken down
[2243.76 - 2249.36] too many blood draws
[2246.88 - 2253.12] too much caffeine
[2249.36 - 2255.68] chocolate coffee green tea matcha tea
[2253.12 - 2257.20] too much caffeine foods that feed the
[2255.68 - 2258.80] bugs
[2257.20 - 2260.48] right
[2258.80 - 2263.28] deborah says i'm not getting any
[2260.48 - 2265.60] notifications for you how do i get them
[2263.28 - 2267.04] again i keep missing you deborah
[2265.60 - 2268.72] that's by design
[2267.04 - 2270.72] not for me
[2268.72 - 2273.36] keeping you from seeing these but it's
[2270.72 - 2273.36] by design
[2273.92 - 2278.08] and that's been happening since 2018
[2278.16 - 2280.96] so
[2279.44 - 2283.52] try turning on your note face
[2280.96 - 2287.36] notifications again and try to give it a
[2283.52 - 2287.36] you know give it a shot try to reset it
[2288.80 - 2291.04] so
[2291.12 - 2295.68] jen's gen z says
[2293.60 - 2297.44] i've been advised to donate more blood
[2295.68 - 2301.60] because my blood is poisoned with carbon
[2297.44 - 2301.60] monoxide so it's not good blood to keep
[2302.24 - 2304.56] look
[2303.28 - 2305.92] i want you to listen to your doctor
[2304.56 - 2307.68] because that's what you should do you if
[2305.92 - 2308.48] you're advised by your your
[2307.68 - 2310.72] your
[2308.48 - 2313.84] health care provider to do something you
[2310.72 - 2315.36] do it if that was me
[2313.84 - 2317.20] i wouldn't be doing that
[2315.36 - 2319.84] if that was me but that's just this is
[2317.20 - 2321.04] just my life i could i could say that
[2319.84 - 2322.80] okay
[2321.04 - 2326.80] and because i would ask myself like why
[2322.80 - 2328.88] would that help someone else then so
[2326.80 - 2330.56] am i going to give i would say to that
[2328.88 - 2333.68] doctor
[2330.56 - 2333.68] i would say to that doctor
[2335.04 - 2338.32] if you want me to donate my blood
[2336.64 - 2341.04] because it's poison with carbon carbon
[2338.32 - 2342.80] monoxide
[2341.04 - 2344.32] isn't that what if there's a child that
[2342.80 - 2345.52] needs my blood
[2344.32 - 2347.60] and they're going to do they're going to
[2345.52 - 2348.88] do a blood transfusion in a child and
[2347.60 - 2351.28] they're going to poison that child with
[2348.88 - 2355.16] carbon monoxide
[2351.28 - 2355.16] that's what i would ask my doctor
[2355.36 - 2358.40] and
[2357.12 - 2359.76] that's really
[2358.40 - 2362.24] disturbing
[2359.76 - 2363.92] i'm going to ask dr nesbitt if he'll
[2362.24 - 2366.48] come out right now because i want to see
[2363.92 - 2369.52] what dr nesbitt has to say
[2366.48 - 2371.20] because dr nesbitt is a better doctor
[2369.52 - 2372.96] than i i believe than probably your
[2371.20 - 2375.12] doctor so i'm going to get dr nets with
[2372.96 - 2376.80] you you just came out of surgery
[2375.12 - 2378.00] dr desmond just came out of surgery

[2378.00 - 2381.60] he's here
[2379.20 - 2383.20] so this is really interesting so i was
[2381.60 - 2385.36] did you hear that before
[2383.20 - 2385.36] so
[2385.60 - 2390.32] okay this patient this doctor's patient
[2388.00 - 2392.72] which is very nice person here
[2390.32 - 2394.32] left a comment right saying that
[2392.72 - 2396.40] she's told to donate her blood because
[2394.32 - 2397.92] her blood's poisoned yeah
[2396.40 - 2399.28] and uh what are you doing doctor
[2397.92 - 2400.96] announcement
[2399.28 - 2402.88] dr nesbit
[2400.96 - 2404.24] dr ness likes to play with everything he
[2402.88 - 2406.32] thinks these are all toys even though
[2404.24 - 2407.68] he's he's a he's on
[2406.32 - 2408.96] he's on the medical board and he's a
[2407.68 - 2411.36] surgeon
[2408.96 - 2412.88] what do you think about that that
[2411.36 - 2413.92] doctor hasn't stopped sticking that in
[2412.88 - 2415.28] my face
[2413.92 - 2416.24] um
[2415.28 - 2418.48] he says
[2416.24 - 2419.44] he wouldn't donate the blood
[2418.48 - 2422.32] what
[2419.44 - 2424.56] he said that doctor is definitely
[2422.32 - 2426.72] a quack what
[2424.56 - 2428.88] he says the doctor's a quack
[2426.72 - 2430.88] and there's a lot of bad doctors out
[2428.88 - 2432.72] there really what why do you say that
[2430.88 - 2434.40] home doctors are good
[2432.72 - 2436.80] he says it's the third
[2434.40 - 2439.68] reason why people die in this country
[2436.80 - 2441.68] alone is from malpractice
[2439.68 - 2444.08] because doctors
[2441.68 - 2447.76] are like
[2444.08 - 2450.72] no that's not right no doctors
[2447.76 - 2452.08] are they're not no what they haven't no
[2450.72 - 2453.76] they have an what are you trying
[2452.08 - 2455.28] to say what
[2453.76 - 2458.08] dr nesbitt
[2455.28 - 2460.72] doesn't even know what he's saying
[2458.08 - 2462.96] he's saying that
[2460.72 - 2463.76] doctors are like everybody has
[2462.96 - 2465.92] one
[2463.76 - 2468.64] that doesn't even make any sense anyway
[2465.92 - 2470.32] dr nesbit has to go back into surgery
[2468.64 - 2472.24] he's taking this with him he's going to
[2470.32 - 2473.84] going to inject this vial of blood that
[2472.24 - 2475.36] has carbon monoxide and some other
[2473.84 - 2476.88] dangerous things in it
[2475.36 - 2478.80] he's going to inject this into his
[2476.88 - 2480.80] patient he thinks he thinks that was
[2478.80 - 2481.68] wise advice from the other doctor to
[2480.80 - 2484.00] just
[2481.68 - 2485.92] put blood that's not good in someone
[2484.00 - 2487.92] else and put it in someone else is that
[2485.92 - 2489.28] release no he's only kidding he would
[2487.92 - 2490.40] never do that
