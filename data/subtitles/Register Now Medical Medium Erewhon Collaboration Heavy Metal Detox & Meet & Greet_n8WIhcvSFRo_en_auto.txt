[439.04 - 443.36] to make a heavy metal detox smoothie
[441.16 - 445.52] right now I got a bunch of stuff in
[443.36 - 447.52] front of me I got this fresh cilantro
[445.52 - 449.92] people don't get enough cilantro in them
[447.52 - 454.28] they just don't they just don't get
[449.92 - 455.96] enough cilantro in them fact fact a lot
[454.28 - 458.36] of people just get a little bit of
[455.96 - 460.20] cilantro in them here and there
[458.36 - 462.16] different ways maybe it's on top of a
[460.20 - 465.04] salad if you're lucky maybe you had a
[462.16 - 468.20] guacamole and it had a a few sprigs of
[465.04 - 470.24] leaves of cilantro in the guacamole and
[468.20 - 473.16] that's how you had it a lot of people
[470.24 - 476.52] don't eat a lot of cilantro but that is
[473.16 - 479.08] a leafy herb green and in medical medium
[476.52 - 482.40] information going all the way back that
[479.08 - 485.04] is powerful that alone is a healing tool
[482.40 - 487.52] people do not understand can't be
[485.04 - 488.96] measured people don't get it really out
[487.52 - 491.48] there in the health movement they don't
[488.96 - 493.28] know what that is right there cilantro
[491.48 - 495.68] oh okay cilantro it's got its health
[493.28 - 497.80] benefits or whatever it's got you know
[495.68 - 499.92] or whatever people talk about but the
[497.80 - 503.68] difference is right there when you use
[499.92 - 507.60] it like in the hmds and you use like a
[503.68 - 510.12] cup of it the something else happens the
[507.60 - 512.68] nutrient profile the phytochemical
[510.12 - 515.12] compounds all of it that's involved in
[512.68 - 518.56] cilantro alone is powerful so when you
[515.12 - 521.52] actually have it as a leafy green herb
[518.56 - 525.08] boom that is powerful right there for
[521.52 - 527.96] your health leafy green herb and it's
[525.08 - 529.88] powerful okay and so that's the cilantro
[527.96 - 532.68] that's going to go in here too then you
[529.88 - 535.72] got the Wyman's wild blueberries right
[532.68 - 538.12] you guys know I work with Wyman's that's
[535.72 - 541.28] an incredible wild blueberry it's a
[538.12 - 543.28] trusted Source it's my favorite of all
[541.28 - 546.80] in the wild blueberry world so there it
[543.28 - 549.28] is right there got the Frozen wild
[546.80 - 551.20] blueberries that's in there I happen to
[549.28 - 553.24] have a mango here I don't have any
[551.20 - 557.28] bananas on hand but a lot of people they
[553.24 - 559.32] don't use bananas in their hmds they'll
[557.28 - 561.08] use something like some papaya I talked
[559.32 - 562.72] about Alternatives in the medical medium
[561.08 - 564.92] books they'll use some papaya they'll
[562.72 - 566.76] use some mango they'll do that and
[564.92 - 568.16] they'll put mango in there which is fine
[566.76 - 570.32] and that's what I have right here I have
[568.16 - 573.24] mango because remember the five
[570.32 - 576.56] ingredients are the key the cilantro the
[573.24 - 580.40] barleygrass juice powder barleygrass
[576.56 - 581.84] juice powder right the wild blueberries
[580.40 - 585.20] that's the other one right there the
[581.84 - 588.04] sparina that's the other one and the DOL
[585.20 - 590.16] so that's the key so whether you put it
[588.04 - 591.48] into like a smoothie bowl like a lot of
[590.16 - 593.88] people in the medical meme Community
[591.48 - 595.20] have done you know and I've talked about
[593.88 - 596.76] in the books unless you put it in like a
[595.20 - 599.00] smoothie bowl or you make a smoothie out
[596.76 - 600.96] of it or you eat them throughout the day
[599.00 - 603.80] you're having your do like I got a
[600.96 - 606.00] friend that takes the the vimer do
[603.80 - 608.40] liquid and they take the vimer Dos
[606.00 - 610.32] liquid they take it like that it's like
[608.40 - 612.04] a supplement they take it it's not even
[610.32 - 613.68] in their smoothie and then they're
[612.04 - 615.52] having cilantro and something else
[613.68 - 617.48] you're eating they'll have a whole bunch
[615.52 - 618.88] of cilantro then they'll do like
[617.48 - 620.64] spirulina and they'll mix it with
[618.88 - 622.12] coconut water and then they'll do this
[620.64 - 625.92] throughout the day but they'll get their
[622.12 - 628.00] five key ingredients key ingredients
[625.92 - 629.80] that are critical that's the whole point
[628.00 - 633.16] with the hmds
[629.80 - 635.76] and so however you dress it up like you
[633.16 - 637.52] put banana in here you put you know
[635.76 - 639.48] something else mango you have mango you
[637.52 - 641.68] have it a smoothie bowl or you spread it
[639.48 - 644.08] out through the day it's the five
[641.68 - 647.88] ingredients that's the medical medium
[644.08 - 651.12] heavy metal detox that's listed out in
[647.88 - 652.56] the medical medium first book right here
[651.12 - 655.16] that's what that is so it's important to
[652.56 - 658.20] know this stuff I don't talk about it
[655.16 - 659.76] enough I should I mean heck it's an
[658.20 - 661.88] incredible

[1126.72 - 1131.00] think the official count is is is over
[1129.16 - 1132.12] 20,000 I don't think that's going to
[1131.00 - 1134.12] happen look I don't think that's going
[1132.12 - 1136.40] to happen here this is not this
[1134.12 - 1137.64] September 7th is not an event I'm going
[1136.40 - 1139.08] to do a meet and greet I'm going to be
[1137.64 - 1140.68] there you throw a book and St front of
[1139.08 - 1143.08] me I'm going to sign it I'm going to you
[1140.68 - 1145.32] know definitely meet you right that's
[1143.08 - 1146.88] what's going to happen there um but I
[1145.32 - 1149.00] don't think it's going to be anything
[1146.88 - 1152.40] like we're looking like 15 20,000 people
[1149.00 - 1154.44] or more Amanda doesn't surprise me I
[1152.40 - 1157.56] went to a concert at a stadium that
[1154.44 - 1159.68] holds 25k and I looked and I thought
[1157.56 - 1162.44] that looks like about the same amount of
[1159.68 - 1164.84] people as were at the mm event well it's
[1162.44 - 1168.16] really funny because there was one guy
[1164.84 - 1170.68] there that's like he he does security
[1168.16 - 1172.24] for concerts and stuff like that and he
[1170.68 - 1173.96] said there were 30,000 people there I
[1172.24 - 1176.08] said it can't be 30,000 he said there's
[1173.96 - 1178.20] 30,000 people here I do security for
[1176.08 - 1181.68] concerts and the whole bed he said this
[1178.20 - 1184.48] is this is close to 30,000 so that's
[1181.68 - 1186.28] what that's what um it is professional
[1184.48 - 1188.84] the security professional who is there
[1186.28 - 1190.80] who does concerts pretty much only and
[1188.84 - 1193.04] that's what he was saying from what he
[1190.80 - 1195.36] can see and tell so he was saying no
[1193.04 - 1196.40] there's he said aw there's 30,000 people
[1195.36 - 1198.24] here I'm just going to tell you my
[1196.40 - 1199.36] professional opinion from what I see I
[1198.24 - 1200.80] said well we still don't know the
[1199.36 - 1202.52] official number and that was happening
[1200.80 - 1204.60] that day like that and then we're
[1202.52 - 1208.44] hearing that it it it was definitely
[1204.60 - 1212.76] most likely over 20 so
[1208.44 - 1216.36] yeah okay all right what else where am
[1212.76 - 1219.20] I I'm in orang land right
[1216.36 - 1221.80] here I don't know why I have to throw
[1219.20 - 1224.44] throw it in the air like I do but I do
[1221.80 - 1225.88] so I'm going to pop some orange in here
[1224.44 - 1229.72] this is so
[1225.88 - 1231.88] great okay
[1229.72 - 1233.64] all right it was so well organized it
[1231.88 - 1235.76] felt like a spiritual event it was it
[1233.64 - 1235.76] was
[1235.84 - 1241.08] Supernatural nothing can explain it
[1238.32 - 1242.76] otherwise I'm just going to be straight
[1241.08 - 1243.96] with you guys like I always am and I'm
[1242.76 - 1247.32] just going to tell you one thing right
[1243.96 - 1250.20] now it was it was Supernatural is what
[1247.32 - 1253.44] it was I was able to knock out a bunch
[1250.20 - 1255.92] of light blasts right and and that that
[1253.44 - 1259.08] alone was was incredible at the moment
[1255.92 - 1262.40] but it was Supernatural
[1259.08 - 1263.88] there was an energy and a light over the
[1262.40 - 1266.76] entire
[1263.88 - 1268.28] event separate from the light blast of
[1266.76 - 1270.52] the light coming down hitting everybody
[1268.28 - 1273.40] in the crown of their head and we
[1270.52 - 1274.52] separate from that there was a light
[1273.40 - 1278.44] that was
[1274.52 - 1281.08] just over the entire entire V like a
[1278.44 - 1284.60] like a bubble like a light bubble it's
[1281.08 - 1286.68] just crazy how incredible all of it was
[1284.60 - 1290.44] and you felt it
[1286.68 - 1291.88] too so yeah
[1290.44 - 1293.52] so I'm getting some orange in here I put
[1291.88 - 1296.44] a little bit more orange in here this is

[1306.88 - 1310.88] whole thing about water if you guys are
[1309.12 - 1313.84] okay with that sometime I might leave a
[1310.88 - 1316.92] little message on telegram about water

[1316.92 - 1321.28] you don't want to be drinking too much
[1319.04 - 1322.60] water I love how you know there's so
[1321.28 - 1324.48] many people there's amateurs in the
[1322.60 - 1326.04] health movement that are um they get
[1324.48 - 1327.72] into the health movement and they're
[1326.04 - 1329.52] they're amateurs whether they're even
[1327.72 - 1331.16] they're they're Physicians too and
[1329.52 - 1333.00] doctors of different kinds and they go
[1331.16 - 1334.36] into the social media world and they
[1333.00 - 1336.96] start getting into health for the first
[1334.36 - 1338.48] time and in all their their career and
[1336.96 - 1340.12] they get interested and they'll do or
[1338.48 - 1343.36] trainers or health coaches and they'll
[1340.12 - 1345.28] say water drink a lot of water that's
[1343.36 - 1346.92] number one that will do you know how
[1345.28 - 1348.76] many people with chronic illness did the
[1346.92 - 1350.84] water thing I remember going back back
[1348.76 - 1353.08] 30 years and people actually coming to
[1350.84 - 1354.32] me for help 30 years ago 35 years ago
[1353.08 - 1356.48] and they're coming to me for help and
[1354.32 - 1357.80] they're like I'm drinking lots of water
[1356.48 - 1360.04] you know my doctor told me to drink a
[1357.80 - 1361.52] lot of water my health person told me to
[1360.04 - 1363.16] drink a lot of water this trainer of
[1361.52 - 1365.84] mine told me to drink a lot of water
[1363.16 - 1367.40] that'll fix my problem did it fix it no
[1365.84 - 1370.00] I'm sick with fatigue and chronic
[1367.40 - 1372.40] illness and pain everywhere and I can't
[1370.00 - 1377.12] do this and I can't do that high anxiety
[1372.40 - 1379.08] and that water trick that like you know
[1377.12 - 1381.04] that water circus trick
[1379.08 - 1382.28] has been around forever it's like you
[1381.04 - 1384.12] know and they make they make it sound
[1382.28 - 1385.88] like they got their cop together so much
[1384.12 - 1387.72] too like on socials you'll see like a
[1385.88 - 1389.88] new brand new trainer just getting into
[1387.72 - 1391.52] it for a year they have some following
[1389.88 - 1393.12] and they're like you know they're doing
[1391.52 - 1394.48] their training and they're like the
[1393.12 - 1395.96] first thing you want to do if you got
[1394.48 - 1397.64] anything wrong like chronic illness is
[1395.96 - 1400.00] you want to drink lots of water lots of
[1397.64 - 1403.00] water and it's
[1400.00 - 1405.88] like 35 years of hearing
[1403.00 - 1407.60] that thousands and thousands of people
[1405.88 - 1408.96] with all kinds of chronic illness drank
[1407.60 - 1410.92] a lot of water
[1408.96 - 1412.56] it's not removing their problem I'm
[1410.92 - 1414.88] sorry it's not getting rid of their
[1412.56 - 1417.12] severe severe clinical depression their
[1414.88 - 1419.12] severe eczema their severe whatever it
[1417.12 - 1420.68] is that they're dealing with they
[1419.12 - 1422.52] neurological problems their multiple
[1420.68 - 1424.32] sclerosis symptoms whatever it is
[1422.52 - 1426.00] neurological lime drinking a ton of
[1424.32 - 1427.48] water is not going to get rid of it it's
[1426.00 - 1429.68] not going to do it but they'll sure as
[1427.48 - 1431.48] heck make it look good and it's like you
[1429.68 - 1432.84] know are you dehydrated that could be
[1431.48 - 1434.32] your whole problem make sure you're
[1432.84 - 1435.80] drinking lots of water every single day
[1434.32 - 1438.04] and then everybody's like oh my God oh
[1435.80 - 1439.32] my God oh my God it's like yeah okay but
[1438.04 - 1440.80] when you're sick you know better when
[1439.32 - 1442.28] you're seasoned you know better that
[1440.80 - 1444.68] that's that's just not what it is and I
[1442.28 - 1446.20] want to talk about water more I think
[1444.68 - 1449.56] it's important in
[1446.20 - 1451.88] hydration now I obviously I talk about
[1449.56 - 1453.24] it in the liver book boom it's right
[1451.88 - 1454.84] over there I don't know if you see that
[1453.24 - 1458.20] I'm not grabbing it right here for IG or

[1759.36 - 1764.24] with vimergy the best stuff out there
[1761.36 - 1768.96] let me just say this really quick I just
[1764.24 - 1771.48] want to say this I had to get a tinure
[1768.96 - 1773.28] I had to purchase a
[1771.48 - 1777.52] tincture
[1773.28 - 1781.32] for a family member something that viy
[1777.52 - 1784.76] didn't have so something that them did
[1781.32 - 1788.36] not have Port this this is really
[1784.76 - 1791.52] interesting so I had to go and
[1788.36 - 1794.36] purchase that tincture that
[1791.52 - 1798.48] herb and I got
[1794.36 - 1800.52] non-alcohol non-alcohol alcohol free
[1798.48 - 1802.36] first thing that happened was I opened
[1800.52 - 1805.64] the bottle and I smelt it and it had
[1802.36 - 1808.48] alcohol in it first thing right
[1805.64 - 1811.20] there very important to know so I had to
[1808.48 - 1813.60] purchase this herb for a family member
[1811.20 - 1815.68] because I needed this herb because
[1813.60 - 1818.88] Spirit of compassion said that's the
[1815.68 - 1821.84] herb I need so I said well vmer doesn't
[1818.88 - 1824.16] carry that herb right now so I can't go
[1821.84 - 1826.40] to that high quality let me search for
[1824.16 - 1830.72] the highest quality herb I can find out
[1826.40 - 1832.60] there because I this herb so I purchased
[1830.72 - 1835.24] what I thought could be possibly the
[1832.60 - 1837.56] best out there that's out there because
[1835.24 - 1840.44] what am I going to do I purchase it it
[1837.56 - 1844.08] says alcohol free I open it up smell
[1840.44 - 1845.68] alcohol instantly smell alcohol first
[1844.08 - 1847.84] things first so I said well that's not
[1845.68 - 1849.96] going to work I ordered another version
[1847.84 - 1851.56] from a different company then another
[1849.96 - 1854.24] version of the herb from another company
[1851.56 - 1855.88] then four more from four other companies
[1854.24 - 1857.72] and it opened up a couple of them
[1855.88 - 1860.72] alcohol they said alcohol free you ready
[1857.72 - 1864.20] for this I opened up another
[1860.72 - 1866.60] one and it was just straight garbage no
[1864.20 - 1869.84] alcohol in it but it had the worst kind
[1866.60 - 1871.48] of Glycerin in it the worst of the worst
[1869.84 - 1874.76] of the worst I opened up another one
[1871.48 - 1877.92] worst kind of Glycerin in it now I know
[1874.76 - 1879.96] how like I know that that's not going to
[1877.92 - 1883.96] do it's not going to
[1879.96 - 1886.96] do it was just terrible junk and garbage
[1883.96 - 1889.48] and that's why I work with vimergy
[1886.96 - 1892.52] that's why I endorse that them like I do
[1889.48 - 1894.48] because it's a it's a world away from
[1892.52 - 1896.16] that it's a world away from the tricks
[1894.48 - 1898.56] and the games and the crap and the
[1896.16 - 1900.88] garbage out there this is important it's
[1898.56 - 1903.24] a world away from all the tricks and the
[1900.88 - 1905.68] games and the garbage out there I can't
[1903.24 - 1908.60] say it enough you guys it's not a
[1905.68 - 1911.32] joke it's unbelievable on what's out
[1908.60 - 1913.40] there here I am I need an herb vimer
[1911.32 - 1915.44] doesn't stock that herb right now I go
[1913.40 - 1917.24] and have to find it somewhere I'm buying
[1915.44 - 1918.80] what I think is the best options you can
[1917.24 - 1920.64] find out there
[1918.80 - 1922.92] I'm looking everywhere I'm ordering each
[1920.64 - 1924.92] one alcohol in that one Al who knows
[1922.92 - 1926.88] what kind of alcohol in there alcohol in
[1924.92 - 1928.84] this one alcohol in that one oh this one
[1926.88 - 1931.28] doesn't have alcohol but it's just
[1928.84 - 1934.84] straight garbage it's got something else
[1931.28 - 1936.52] in there or it's just junk all on its
[1934.84 - 1938.80] own or it's got a bad glycerin it's like
[1936.52 - 1940.88] here's one that's alcohol-free maybe
[1938.80 - 1944.00] they did the herb right in this one and
[1940.88 - 1946.80] then the glycerin was just terrible
[1944.00 - 1948.76] terrible glycerin so I'm thinking oh my
[1946.80 - 1951.20] God like what kind of or it is that what
[1948.76 - 1953.12] are they even using and they're like oh
[1951.20 - 1955.40] I know what it is and see the whole
[1953.12 - 1959.48] point is that that's the difference
[1955.40 - 1960.96] right there so when I when I get vimergy
[1959.48 - 1962.40] that that's what I mean that's what
[1960.96 - 1964.20] you're getting with vimergy you're
[1962.40 - 1966.52] getting away from that it's a world
[1964.20 - 1968.08] apart from that this is important I'm
[1966.52 - 1969.20] making the heavy metal detox smoothie I
[1968.08 - 1971.16] saw somebody said what are we talking
[1969.20 - 1973.00] about I'm making the hmds right here I
[1971.16 - 1974.28] got all my stuff out here but I'm
[1973.00 - 1975.60] talking about like something that's
[1974.28 - 1978.92] really important because I just had to
[1975.60 - 1982.40] seek out another herb that vimergy does
[1978.92 - 1985.20] not stock and they do not they do not
[1982.40 - 1988.68] stock at all and I had to go get it and
[1985.20 - 1990.40] it was terrifying in my opinion it had
[1988.68 - 1993.36] some form of Al couple of them had some
[1990.40 - 1995.52] forms of alcohol in it who knows what
[1993.36 - 1997.92] and nobody knows and it was alcohol-free
[1995.52 - 1999.72] what was it even doing in there and then
[1997.92 - 2001.92] the other stuff too I was just talking
[1999.72 - 2005.16] about as well which was the glycerin
[2001.92 - 2008.36] terrible glycerin just it's I just want
[2005.16 - 2011.52] to say that I I like I
[2008.36 - 2013.20] appreciate vimergy for what they've done
[2011.52 - 2015.12] I don't care what anybody thinks of me
[2013.20 - 2017.28] oh he just works with them or something
[2015.12 - 2019.36] I don't care what anybody says and
[2017.28 - 2021.64] remember I don't own vimergy I don't own
[2019.36 - 2023.44] stocks shares I don't own any percentage
[2021.64 - 2026.36] of the company I'm not an owner of the
[2023.44 - 2026.36] company on any
[2026.44 - 2029.80] level very important to know because I
[2028.60 - 2031.40] know there's lies out there left and
[2029.80 - 2034.12] right about that but the point is is
[2031.40 - 2037.84] that I back these
[2034.12 - 2041.08] guys I I support them and back them
[2037.84 - 2043.16] endorse them because of what they have
[2041.08 - 2044.76] done and still do and it can't be
[2043.16 - 2047.16] matched and you kind of forget about it
[2044.76 - 2049.52] because I haven't been taking anything
[2047.16 - 2051.44] personally or having a family member
[2049.52 - 2054.28] take anything personally that that
[2051.44 - 2056.40] they're taking that's outside of the viy
[2054.28 - 2059.68] supplements and this is the first time
[2056.40 - 2062.28] in a long time and it was like wakeup
[2059.68 - 2064.96] call man it was like wakeup call
[2062.28 - 2067.72] unfreaking believable it was a wakeup
[2064.96 - 2070.72] call so when I had to go outside of the
[2067.72 - 2074.08] BG's protective bubble outside of their
[2070.72 - 2076.84] unbelievable incredible Angelic products
[2074.08 - 2080.12] when I had to go outside of that and
[2076.84 - 2084.44] then get an herb I was up against the
[2080.12 - 2086.04] wild west of crap alcohol nobody knows
[2084.44 - 2087.36] what kind of alcohol it says alcohol
[2086.04 - 2088.64] free but it was loaded in there no one
[2087.36 - 2090.16] would ever know and there are brands
[2088.64 - 2091.44] that you would you probably somebody
[2090.16 - 2093.36] probably uses that are just watching
[2091.44 - 2096.12] this right now and then other other
[2093.36 - 2099.52] brands have the terrifying bad glycerin
[2096.12 - 2100.92] in there it's like why West out there
[2099.52 - 2103.28] and it's like I just wanted to just be
[2100.92 - 2105.68] like okay I I I just wish I didn't need
[2103.28 - 2107.80] that herb for somebody I just wish I
[2105.68 - 2110.12] could push that away and go back into
[2107.80 - 2111.92] the vimergy bubble of safety of how
[2110.12 - 2113.60] incredible the stuff is but minute
[2111.92 - 2115.24] you're pushed out of it a little bit and
[2113.60 - 2116.72] it got pushed out of it to go it's just
[2115.24 - 2119.72] it's just
[2116.72 - 2122.80] unbelievable anyway so important to know
[2119.72 - 2125.92] so that's the DOL right there and adul
[2122.80 - 2128.48] liquid just yeah mind blowing all on its
[2125.92 - 2131.16] own
[2128.48 - 2133.12] but I'm still seeing every day out there
[2131.16 - 2135.12] just all the different Malarkey that's
[2133.12 - 2138.48] happening in so many different
[2135.12 - 2140.24] ways um seriously all the different
[2138.48 - 2142.48] things that are happening out there like
[2140.24 - 2145.64] I still see people using the alkine
[2142.48 - 2149.64] ionizer water machines I still see them
[2145.64 - 2151.08] doing that if they only knew what is
[2149.64 - 2152.96] happening with that they just wouldn't
[2151.08 - 2156.36] even believe it it's just it's just
[2152.96 - 2159.04] awful this is barley grass juice powder
[2156.36 - 2160.28] by the way going in the each MDS that's
[2159.04 - 2163.76] barley grass juice powder that's the
[2160.28 - 2167.00] vimer G1 V is in Victor i m e RG y right
[2163.76 - 2168.92] there okay not barly grass a big mistake
[2167.00 - 2172.96] with the hmds and I see it out there all
[2168.92 - 2174.56] the time is when they do the mm hmds
[2172.96 - 2177.52] that what they do is they put barley
[2174.56 - 2180.08] grass in that scratchy stuff right
[2177.52 - 2182.88] basically it's like horse grass right
[2180.08 - 2185.28] it's like it's like coming off of a farm
[2182.88 - 2188.08] field sitting there rolled up in a ball
[2185.28 - 2189.88] like a baale of hay you know you know
[2188.08 - 2192.60] they're using that and then it's all
[2189.88 - 2194.52] pulverized down and crushed down and
[2192.60 - 2195.96] it's putting canisters and you'll see
[2194.52 - 2197.72] there's canisters out there there's
[2195.96 - 2199.52] green caners out there with different
[2197.72 - 2201.72] Greens in it and it's like barley grass
[2199.52 - 2203.36] not barley grass juice powder yeah and
[2201.72 - 2205.00] that that's that's a problem especially
[2203.36 - 2206.68] if you have intestinal track issues and
[2205.00 - 2211.20] stuff but that's the juice powder right
[2206.68 - 2213.32] there I'm going to put the vimergy wild
[2211.20 - 2215.20] blueberry now what you'll notice right
[2213.32 - 2217.72] here this this is mind-blowing right
[2215.20 - 2219.20] here I got to show you this okay all
[2217.72 - 2222.20] right so I'm going to put this in front
[2219.20 - 2225.84] of you right there take a look okay let
[2222.20 - 2228.64] me just get a utensil so I want you guys
[2225.84 - 2231.28] to see this okay
[2228.64 - 2233.04] right see what I have to do in here with
[2231.28 - 2235.88] this see
[2233.04 - 2237.44] this do you know why I have to do that
[2235.88 - 2240.92] because it's the first of its kind that
[2237.44 - 2243.80] doesn't have the anti- binder agents in
[2240.92 - 2246.08] it all your powders out there all your
[2243.80 - 2248.20] stuff out there has the antibinding
[2246.08 - 2250.64] agents in it you you like the taste of
[2248.20 - 2253.84] that binder that they use the anti-
[2250.64 - 2255.76] binder agents exactly anti-caking agents
[2253.84 - 2257.92] there's none in here so what I'm doing
[2255.76 - 2260.36] is I'm breaking up the wild blueberry
[2257.92 - 2262.48] powder the reason why it's in that it's
[2260.36 - 2265.64] doing that people don't know is because
[2262.48 - 2267.40] of the quality it doesn't have the
[2265.64 - 2269.96] anti-caking agents because that's what
[2267.40 - 2272.32] people are actually eating every day
[2269.96 - 2276.08] what are they
[2272.32 - 2278.00] corn things like that starch of some
[2276.08 - 2279.56] bizarre type of starch
[2278.00 - 2282.28] all kinds of different
[2279.56 - 2284.64] stuff who knows what if there's talc in
[2282.28 - 2287.00] there in people's stuff what if there's
[2284.64 - 2290.44] talc in there how about that to keep it
[2287.00 - 2292.48] from like caking Anyway here goes the
[2290.44 - 2296.64] spirina right
[2292.48 - 2299.60] here okay spirulin there are differences
[2296.64 - 2300.80] with with qualities of Spirulina when
[2299.60 - 2302.84] you see spirulina and all these
[2300.80 - 2305.52] different products out there plan on it
[2302.84 - 2307.84] being the junk just just to so people
[2305.52 - 2309.92] can make money and save save wherever
[2307.84 - 2312.60] they can remember uses the top tier
[2309.92 - 2314.36] stuff so that's the spirina no
[2312.60 - 2315.28] anti-caking agent so anyway that's going
[2314.36 - 2318.72] in the
[2315.28 - 2320.52] hmds which is incredible I got that I'm
[2318.72 - 2323.60] putting a little bit of Wyman's W
[2320.52 - 2325.92] blueberry juice right there in
[2323.60 - 2329.52] here little shot of that in there too
[2325.92 - 2333.52] I'm ready to blend this up I'm
[2329.52 - 2336.24] hungry all right let's pop it on here
[2333.52 - 2338.64] let's do it so the
[2336.24 - 2341.28] hmds is is
[2338.64 - 2343.68] legendary on its own for what it has
[2341.28 - 2347.88] done for people people who have suffered
[2343.68 - 2350.72] greatly people who lost hope and they
[2347.88 - 2352.84] used the hmds and it changed their life
[2350.72 - 2353.96] they used the heavy metal detox and it
[2352.84 - 2356.00] changed their
[2353.96 - 2357.08] life what you want to do is you want to
[2356.00 - 2359.32] put that lid

[2400.92 - 2407.00] here and there we are
[2404.52 - 2410.92] amazing there we
[2407.00 - 2413.00] are there's the hmds right there and I'm
[2410.92 - 2416.36] excited about this someone asked if they
[2413.00 - 2418.88] can if I can uh list a link of the
[2416.36 - 2420.16] product somewhere like where is it um if
[2418.88 - 2421.88] you comment
[2420.16 - 2424.52] once
[2421.88 - 2426.32] um one live you know here's what I could
[2424.52 - 2428.88] do right here
[2426.32 - 2430.32] is check out the link in the profile in
[2428.88 - 2434.48] the link in the description if you could
[2430.32 - 2436.64] see it if there is to this live you know
[2434.48 - 2436.64] all
[2436.80 - 2442.96] right
[2439.76 - 2442.96] yeah all
[2445.40 - 2451.68] right so someone asked to link the
[2449.28 - 2453.20] products is what happened so I'm going
[2451.68 - 2455.84] to figure that out for you guys all
[2453.20 - 2457.80] right so I just made this it's in here
[2455.84 - 2459.80] um all right I want to about a couple
[2457.80 - 2461.92] other cool things too about everything
[2459.80 - 2463.36] so listen to this right here so the back
[2461.92 - 2464.92] to the water thing I was talking about
[2463.36 - 2466.36] earlier about hydration and stuff I
[2464.92 - 2467.68] think anybody who seasoned and been
[2466.36 - 2469.16] there and done that they know that just
[2467.68 - 2470.84] drinking a ton of water isn't going to
[2469.16 - 2472.24] fix their neurological problems you
[2470.84 - 2473.80] don't want to be dehydrated you want to
[2472.24 - 2475.52] drink a little bit of water I'm going to
[2473.80 - 2477.24] go into a whole talk about that as we go
[2475.52 - 2480.04] along as
[2477.24 - 2482.48] well um as we go along in the future
[2480.04 - 2484.12] because I want to do some water talks I
[2482.48 - 2485.56] think that's going to be a good thing
[2484.12 - 2486.84] for a lot of people a lot of people
[2485.56 - 2487.84] don't know how much water should they
[2486.84 - 2489.76] drain
[2487.84 - 2491.36] how much water they shouldn't drink what
[2489.76 - 2492.76] are you doing are youing coconut water
[2491.36 - 2494.36] are you drinking other things are you
[2492.76 - 2496.40] drinking celery juice are you drinking
[2494.36 - 2498.68] the hmds every single day all those
[2496.40 - 2500.60] things add into the equation so I want
[2498.68 - 2502.56] to do an in-depth talk about water and
[2500.60 - 2505.04] water drinking because I've seen people
[2502.56 - 2507.32] out there drink too much water while
[2505.04 - 2509.52] they're doing all this other stuff and
[2507.32 - 2512.08] I've seen people not drink enough water
[2509.52 - 2515.04] too at the same time out there but the
[2512.08 - 2519.96] bottom line is is the water trick all in
[2515.04 - 2522.40] its own to to heal people is a mirage
[2519.96 - 2523.84] all on its own yeah of course if you're
[2522.40 - 2525.40] severely dehydrated and you're not
[2523.84 - 2527.40] drinking anything then you better get
[2525.40 - 2529.04] some water but but the bottom line is
[2527.40 - 2530.72] and yeah it's going to help but what I'm
[2529.04 - 2532.32] talking about is everyday chronic
[2530.72 - 2534.56] illness people who are suffering with so
[2532.32 - 2537.68] many symptoms and conditions water
[2534.56 - 2539.80] doesn't fix it it just doesn't fix it
[2537.68 - 2541.20] but get out there you'll hear every day
[2539.80 - 2542.64] from professionals on social media
[2541.20 - 2543.80] they'll be like drink water it's the
[2542.64 - 2545.44] first thing you need to do and it makes
[2543.80 - 2547.20] you feel like well confident like whoa I
[2545.44 - 2549.24] think I have a way to get better now
[2547.20 - 2551.76] just drink a lot of water then they end
[2549.24 - 2554.04] up drinking too much water and they
[2551.76 - 2555.56] dilute their electrolytes they're
[2554.04 - 2558.56] diluting
[2555.56 - 2560.12] everything and that's another whole
[2558.56 - 2561.68] problem all on its own so I want to talk
[2560.12 - 2564.84] about that to you guys anyway I just
[2561.68 - 2567.16] made the hmds I like having it with a
[2564.84 - 2568.96] spoon sometimes not just drinking it
[2567.16 - 2570.08] like this but with a spoon if you guys
[2568.96 - 2571.48] just got here I was making an
[2570.08 - 2573.92] announcement today it's going to be a
