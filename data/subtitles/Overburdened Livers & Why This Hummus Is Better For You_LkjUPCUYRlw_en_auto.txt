[7.76 - 14.00] you don't have the MN 1500 hands down
[10.68 - 15.40] the MN 1500 saves people money now I'm
[14.00 - 17.00] watching out there all the time I'm just
[15.40 - 19.00] going to say this the juicers that are
[17.00 - 20.52] getting popular because they got money
[19.00 - 22.68] behind them and advertising and
[20.52 - 24.48] influencers behind them those juicers
[22.68 - 26.28] they don't squeeze enough juice out of
[24.48 - 28.44] the produce and so essentially you're
[26.28 - 30.24] throwing away money and people who are
[28.44 - 31.88] chronically sick are trying to juice
[30.24 - 34.76] every day people in the medical mem
[31.88 - 36.92] Community who juice a ton of stuff they
[34.76 - 40.16] can't just be buying cases and cases of
[36.92 - 41.44] produce juicing it and having not the
[40.16 - 42.92] results because you're not getting
[41.44 - 45.36] enough nutrients extracted from the
[42.92 - 47.28] juice it's not actually doing its job to
[45.36 - 49.64] get the juice out and they're throwing
[47.28 - 51.52] away produce all that leftover pulp is
[49.64 - 54.08] getting thrown away that's what I love
[51.52 - 55.76] about the mm 1500 the 900 this is the mm
[54.08 - 57.64] 1500 right here you guys know I work
[55.76 - 60.00] with the mega link is in the description
[57.64 - 62.92] links in the profile but we're talking
[60.00 - 64.84] today about eating to protect your liver
[62.92 - 68.52] what people don't realize they have
[64.84 - 71.40] overburdened stagnant sluggish hot
[68.52 - 72.92] livers that are filled with fat the
[71.40 - 75.12] livers get dysfunctional and then your
[72.92 - 77.12] cholesterol gets out of whack everything
[75.12 - 78.76] else gets out of whack deficiencies
[77.12 - 80.96] start to happen because your liver is
[78.76 - 83.48] the great converter so what happens with
[80.96 - 85.12] people's livers is that they actually
[83.48 - 88.08] burden them and they don't realize they
[85.12 - 89.56] burden them so they overburden livers
[88.08 - 91.52] every single day and that's what we're
[89.56 - 93.24] kind of taught we're not taught how to
[91.52 - 94.92] protect our liver how to look after our
[93.24 - 96.68] liver how to get our liver in a better
[94.92 - 98.20] place and then over time our liver stops
[96.68 - 99.92] working the way it should work it
[98.20 - 102.36] doesn't produce enough bile and when
[99.92 - 104.36] that bile isn't produced we get in
[102.36 - 105.76] trouble and all that fat sits around it
[104.36 - 107.08] doesn't break down good enough it sits
[105.76 - 108.96] around in our bloodstream then it
[107.08 - 110.76] eventually collects in Our arteries then
[108.96 - 112.64] it collects in our veins and over time
[110.76 - 115.04] we get problems where we have all this
[112.64 - 117.32] plaque jacked up all around our blood
[115.04 - 119.08] vessels veins arteries our liver gets
[117.32 - 121.00] sluggish another thing too you go to the
[119.08 - 122.84] doctor doctor takes blood work the blood
[121.00 - 123.92] work comes back you're deficient in this
[122.84 - 125.16] you're deficient in that you're
[123.92 - 128.08] deficient in this and all these
[125.16 - 129.76] deficiencies over time partly happen
[128.08 - 132.28] because your liver is the great
[129.76 - 135.96] converter what it does is it actually
[132.28 - 138.36] converts the nutrients and we don't have
[135.96 - 140.56] good livers these days so we don't get
[138.36 - 143.44] good conversion because you want good
[140.56 - 146.56] conversion every single nutrient you eat
[143.44 - 148.28] almost every single nutrient you eat
[146.56 - 149.84] nutrients that come from your leafy
[148.28 - 152.24] greens nutrients that come from your
[149.84 - 154.28] onions your broccoli your radishes your
[152.24 - 156.36] carrots everything your lemons your
[154.28 - 158.92] limes your Tomatoes your avocados all
[156.36 - 160.68] those nutrients have to be converted
[158.92 - 162.76] they go into the liver boom they go up
[160.68 - 165.52] the hepatic portal highway right into
[162.76 - 167.52] the liver here and when that happens
[165.52 - 170.08] your liver says whoa It's conversion
[167.52 - 172.80] time so your liver has to anoint and
[170.08 - 174.80] bless the nutrients is what it has to do
[172.80 - 176.32] and people don't realize this they think
[174.80 - 177.92] that if you take a whole bunch of
[176.32 - 179.84] supplements the supplements are going to
[177.92 - 180.92] work for you you take a whole bunch of
[179.84 - 182.80] different things are going to work for
[180.92 - 185.08] you and partially that partially that's
[182.80 - 188.32] true but your liver still has to
[185.08 - 191.80] methylate it still has to convert it
[188.32 - 194.04] still has to anoint and turn and change
[191.80 - 196.36] the nutrients around around a little bit
[194.04 - 199.12] it has to bless them enzymes from the
[196.36 - 202.40] liver attach to the nutrients carry the
[199.12 - 203.92] nutrients along change the nutrients too
[202.40 - 205.76] and then the liver has to store the
[203.92 - 208.48] nutrients at the same time but if we
[205.76 - 210.40] overburden we beat down our livers we
[208.48 - 212.96] drink alcohol we do all kinds of stuff
[210.40 - 216.08] we eat really greasy food fried foods we
[212.96 - 218.48] eat too much oil in everything we get in
[216.08 - 221.40] trouble the liver ends up weakening and
[218.48 - 223.52] when it weakens it can't convert so we
[221.40 - 225.24] walk around our liver's getting tired
[223.52 - 227.64] it's getting stagnant it's getting
[225.24 - 229.84] sluggish and then it's not doing its job
[227.64 - 232.84] every day and then we go to bed at night
[229.84 - 235.80] and our liver is tired it's too tired to
[232.84 - 237.48] work hard for us all night long so what
[235.80 - 240.56] happens when you go to bed at night your
[237.48 - 244.04] liver starts to work that's when it
[240.56 - 246.56] clocks in mainly clocks in in the middle
[244.04 - 249.28] of the night that's where it starts to
[246.56 - 251.56] bag up all the garbage all the junk all
[249.28 - 254.04] the toxins all the poisons they get
[251.56 - 255.80] bagged up in the middle of the night and
[254.04 - 257.92] you got to keep that in mind right so
[255.80 - 260.36] when we sleep our liver working while
[257.92 - 262.96] we're resting that's how it works our
[260.36 - 264.60] liers working while we're resting think
[262.96 - 266.16] about a whole bunch of elves inside your
[264.60 - 268.08] liver and they're making all kinds of
[266.16 - 270.12] toys and they're doing all kinds of
[268.08 - 272.48] stuff and they're using Hammers and saws
[270.12 - 275.68] they're working all night long while
[272.48 - 277.92] you're sleeping and resting but when our
[275.68 - 279.72] livers get tired and they get beat up
[277.92 - 282.20] and they get overburdened and they get
[279.72 - 284.12] fatty and they start to get sluggish and
[282.20 - 286.64] stagnant when they work in the middle of
[284.12 - 289.44] the night they're not as efficient our
[286.64 - 291.24] livers are not as working as they should
[289.44 - 293.00] or efficient as they should so in the
[291.24 - 294.72] middle of the night we sit there and
[293.00 - 296.76] sometimes people toss and turntime
[294.72 - 298.44] sometimes people have more gas sometimes
[296.76 - 299.80] people have they're waking up in the
[298.44 - 300.92] middle of the night sometimes times
[299.80 - 302.20] people don't feel good when they're
[300.92 - 304.00] trying to sleep they're tossing and
[302.20 - 306.72] turning and a lot of that is liver
[304.00 - 308.88] spasming out so people get liver spasms
[306.72 - 310.92] they don't even know it a lot of people
[308.88 - 313.68] and inside their body they got an
[310.92 - 316.12] unhappy liver every single day that
[313.68 - 318.80] wants to perform that wants to move
[316.12 - 321.60] forward that wants to heal that wants to
[318.80 - 323.76] get better but it just can't do what it
[321.60 - 325.96] needs to do let's make some garbanzo
[323.76 - 328.00] bean hummus so what I have right here is
[325.96 - 329.68] a bowl of chickpeas garbanzo beans and
[328.00 - 331.76] I'm going to make hummus I'm going to
[329.68 - 333.96] make it without using Sesame tahini I'm
[331.76 - 335.88] not going to use a whole bunch of tahini
[333.96 - 337.88] in here I'm not not going to dump a
[335.88 - 340.24] whole bunch of olive oil in here either
[337.88 - 341.88] this is easier food on the liver that's
[340.24 - 344.88] what this is so what you see is sesame
[341.88 - 347.76] seeds take a look you can get the flavor
[344.88 - 350.28] of Sesame in your hummus without
[347.76 - 352.36] burdening the liver with too much oil
[350.28 - 354.28] too much tahini you don't need to do
[352.36 - 357.04] that you can make a hummus and just use
[354.28 - 358.92] some sesame seeds in here get it ground
[357.04 - 360.60] up all the same in there that's that's
[358.92 - 362.32] the difference so let's go let's drop
[360.60 - 364.52] some of these garbanzo beans in here
[362.32 - 367.56] right here you can make hummus without
[364.52 - 370.08] olive oil without tahini I got some
[367.56 - 373.52] garbanzos coming through you realize
[370.08 - 376.24] like how very little this is a handful
[373.52 - 378.60] of sesame seeds much different than a
[376.24 - 381.16] tablespoon of tahini in somebody's
[378.60 - 383.80] hummus right this is a basic hummus you
[381.16 - 385.64] don't have to go too crazy I got a lemon
[383.80 - 387.28] squeezing the lemon right in here there
[385.64 - 389.52] we go let me show you right here that's
[387.28 - 392.00] hummus and there isn't a tablespoon of
[389.52 - 394.48] oil there's not a tablespoon of olive
[392.00 - 396.44] oil there isn't a tablespoon of tahini
[394.48 - 399.48] in here it's easy on the liver so I'm
[396.44 - 402.80] just mixing this up there we go back to
[399.48 - 406.76] the crud this time it's with hummus made
[402.80 - 406.76] from the mm 1500 I'm going to take a
[413.80 - 416.80] radish
