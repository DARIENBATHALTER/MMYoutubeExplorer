[301.80 - 308.12] telling me not to drink and not to try
[304.68 - 310.74] it when I was younger so I adhered by
[308.12 - 313.62] soc's information
[310.74 - 317.10] and words and so what I do is I put this
[313.62 - 319.92] in here instead so that's what I like

[347.64 - 350.94] you know people are spending like that
[349.26 - 352.68] kind of money for wine that's 2 000
[350.94 - 353.88] years old they find some old wine
[352.68 - 354.96] somewhere and they're like it's been
[353.88 - 356.34] just sitting down in the ground
[354.96 - 358.38] somewhere
[356.34 - 360.00] and it's like a bunch of a bunch of
[358.38 - 361.50] people come out of the woodwork that
[360.00 - 363.30] have millions and billions of dollars
[361.50 - 366.06] and they're like buying a bottle of it
[363.30 - 368.28] for you know for literally a million
[366.06 - 369.84] dollars a bottle five million dollars a
[368.28 - 372.00] bottle or something it's like dude it's
[369.84 - 375.30] just grapes fermented
[372.00 - 376.50] yeah okay so let's talk about what we're
[375.30 - 378.54] doing today we're talking about the
[376.50 - 380.46] spiritual power of the wild Bluebird we
[378.54 - 382.02] talked about the antioxidants too which
[380.46 - 385.08] is also something that's really exciting
[382.02 - 387.96] to me and
[385.08 - 390.90] um you know the thing is is that this is
[387.96 - 392.58] a food we are so blessed and lucky to
[390.90 - 395.76] have here on Earth
[392.58 - 400.50] like this is a resource
[395.76 - 404.88] that we are blessed like we should be so
[400.50 - 407.76] grateful to have this resource in our
[404.88 - 410.58] hands right now okay I talked about
[407.76 - 414.18] yesterday how wild blueberries the
[410.58 - 416.10] species isn't just one think about that
[414.18 - 419.34] right now if you look at a wild
[416.10 - 422.34] Blueberry Field it's not one plant
[419.34 - 425.88] species like others out there in the
[422.34 - 427.26] world it's not one plant species and I'm
[425.88 - 429.12] saying that over and over again because
[427.26 - 432.72] this is huge
[429.12 - 436.20] there are multiple plant species in that
[432.72 - 439.08] field of wild blueberries but they all
[436.20 - 442.14] kind of look the same right you just see
[439.08 - 443.52] a sea of wild blueberries and of course
[442.14 - 445.26] the berries are a little bit off in
[443.52 - 447.30] different sizes and everything in the
[445.26 - 450.42] field but either way
[447.30 - 453.78] there are different species in that
[450.42 - 457.02] field this is their survival method
[453.78 - 458.78] it's a part of how they have survived
[457.02 - 460.92] for thousands and thousands of years
[458.78 - 464.22] which is incredible now here's another
[460.92 - 467.16] thing too now this is part of like the
[464.22 - 470.76] spiritual power that the wild blueberry
[467.16 - 474.36] holds because you can't kill it now you
[470.76 - 476.52] can kill every tree on the planet
[474.36 - 478.86] and if you do
[476.52 - 483.02] they won't come back
[478.86 - 487.34] because you need a seed you need right
[483.02 - 489.96] you need an acorn you have to reseed
[487.34 - 493.38] those trees
[489.96 - 495.48] a tree will not grow when it's been cut
[493.38 - 498.18] and burned down
[495.48 - 500.76] it can't come back an oak tree won't
[498.18 - 501.66] come back a maple tree will not come
[500.76 - 505.64] back
[501.66 - 510.12] it has to be the seed to start another
[505.64 - 513.18] maple tree a seed to start another oak
[510.12 - 517.26] tree right and that's how it works
[513.18 - 519.42] but you can burn the wild blueberry down
[517.26 - 520.80] to the ground and it rises out of the
[519.42 - 522.96] ashes
[520.80 - 527.04] Like a Phoenix
[522.96 - 529.74] it has spiritual Powers it can survive
[527.04 - 532.86] the unsurvivable
[529.74 - 535.74] that's the kind of food I want in my
[532.86 - 537.84] body that's the kind of food people who
[535.74 - 539.82] have been through hell and back need
[537.84 - 541.86] inside their body
[539.82 - 543.24] that's the kind of food people who have
[541.86 - 544.32] been through chronic illness they've
[543.24 - 546.30] been through sickness they've been
[544.32 - 547.86] through strife and struggles they've
[546.30 - 549.96] been through suffering they've been
[547.86 - 551.70] through hardships and losses they've
[549.96 - 554.58] been through mental abuse they've been
[551.70 - 556.50] through mental you know power Downs what
[554.58 - 558.90] that means is just being beaten down
[556.50 - 561.90] mentally and everything else they've
[558.90 - 564.84] been through hell and back
[561.90 - 569.10] and the wild blueberry is for the people
[564.84 - 570.84] who have been down there before right in
[569.10 - 572.88] that place where you're on your hands
[570.84 - 575.22] and knees you're praying to God you lost
[572.88 - 576.78] a lot you struggled you're even if it's
[575.22 - 579.06] something that's mild to somebody else
[576.78 - 580.68] but it's really serious to you where
[579.06 - 582.42] someone gets serious and whatever
[580.68 - 583.80] because everybody has a different
[582.42 - 585.78] challenge
[583.80 - 588.60] and a different problem
[585.78 - 589.92] and a different struggle and they're all
[588.60 - 592.44] important
[589.92 - 594.18] there's no you know like saying well
[592.44 - 595.80] that's not important that is or that's
[594.18 - 598.68] they're all important so whatever
[595.80 - 600.60] anybody's ever been through
[598.68 - 602.34] it's important to note the wild
[600.60 - 604.56] blueberries for them if you're having
[602.34 - 606.90] trouble on Instagram or Facebook go to
[604.56 - 610.20] medicalmedium.com we are live right now

[617.88 - 622.02] hopefully if you guys hear me and you go

[622.02 - 627.30] so the wild blueberry is a spiritual
[625.20 - 631.08] plant all on its own
[627.30 - 635.34] that's plant medicine right there
[631.08 - 636.90] it's not toxicity plant medicine where
[635.34 - 639.90] you think you're doing plant medicine
[636.90 - 642.12] and it's altering your mind in a toxic
[639.90 - 644.82] way damaging nerve cells damaging
[642.12 - 647.10] neurons you know like ayahuasca that's
[644.82 - 648.90] not plant medicine that's just a toxic
[647.10 - 651.36] plant right
[648.90 - 654.36] that's just a toxic
[651.36 - 655.68] substance right now I'm not I hope I
[654.36 - 658.02] didn't get anybody upset I'm just trying
[655.68 - 662.40] to show you the differences right here
[658.02 - 665.18] okay same thing with plants that have
[662.40 - 668.10] caffeine in them right
[665.18 - 669.84] caffeine is toxic to the brain and I
[668.10 - 671.28] talked about that many times over the
[669.84 - 672.60] years and talk about that in the brain
[671.28 - 674.94] saver book so we're going to be reading
[672.60 - 677.82] on the brain saver books if you guys
[674.94 - 679.14] have the brain saver books
[677.82 - 681.18] check it out
[679.14 - 682.56] I got a micro dosing chapter in here so
[681.18 - 684.72] if you're somebody that's into that kind
[682.56 - 685.80] of stuff read the chapter you'll be mind
[684.72 - 687.60] blown
[685.80 - 690.12] so I can tell you
[687.60 - 692.72] anyway the brain saver books amazon.com
[690.12 - 694.68] us 40 off
[692.72 - 696.96] 26.29 dollars
[694.68 - 699.18] I just want to let everybody know that
[696.96 - 701.28] these are incredible Bibles right here
[699.18 - 704.34] with a tremendous amount of information
[701.28 - 706.44] there's 12 books in these two books 12
[704.34 - 708.12] books including 100 recipes and
[706.44 - 711.00] everything else a recipe book everything
[708.12 - 713.22] else too so
[711.00 - 716.88] there's different plants out there for
[713.22 - 718.92] instance like caffeinated plants
[716.88 - 720.60] right caffeine is damaging to the
[718.92 - 723.24] adrenals
[720.60 - 725.04] so that's not plant medicine that's
[723.24 - 727.26] plant toxicity
[725.04 - 729.48] because it could damage the adrenals
[727.26 - 731.82] people don't realize that
[729.48 - 733.44] so when people do caffeine whether it's
[731.82 - 734.88] green tea whether it's matcha tea
[733.44 - 736.86] whether it's cacao whatever it is
[734.88 - 738.42] whether it's coffee that's damaging
[736.86 - 740.76] their adrenals
[738.42 - 742.20] right so I mean if you're into that just
[740.76 - 743.58] don't get mad at me don't shoot the
[742.20 - 745.62] messenger I'm just telling you what
[743.58 - 746.70] damages and destroys your adrenal glands
[745.62 - 750.30] right
[746.70 - 752.70] so what happens is that there's plant
[750.30 - 755.64] medicine that doesn't damage your
[752.70 - 758.04] adrenals or your neurons or your brain
[755.64 - 761.52] it's a spiritual based plant medicine
[758.04 - 763.86] that does the opposite it's critical for
[761.52 - 765.42] Focus concentration it's critical to get
[763.86 - 767.46] the anthocyanins to the brain it's
[765.42 - 769.56] critical for your spiritual growth so
[767.46 - 772.26] there's plant medicine
[769.56 - 774.78] that rises above
[772.26 - 778.86] anything like toxicity out there
[774.78 - 781.20] toxicity plant fake plant medicine
[778.86 - 782.76] so there's plant medicine that super
[781.20 - 785.88] seeds
[782.76 - 787.80] other plants out there for us and our
[785.88 - 790.98] brain and our health
[787.80 - 793.32] so that's where the wild blueberry
[790.98 - 794.64] comes in that's how incredible if you
[793.32 - 797.16] guys want to know if you just came on
[794.64 - 799.02] here 10 off you guys know I work with
[797.16 - 801.06] Wyman's I told you guys
[799.02 - 802.80] fully endorse them because I don't want
[801.06 - 804.60] this to go away I want to give as much
[802.80 - 806.70] support I want to tell as many people as
[804.60 - 808.62] possible I want people to order this
[806.70 - 812.10] someday so they can get it into their
[808.62 - 815.88] body and have that inside of them and I
[812.10 - 818.52] want Wyman's to keep on making this kind
[815.88 - 820.08] of resource it's unbelievable they take
[818.52 - 822.96] the berries out of the field they press
[820.08 - 824.40] them it goes into the bottle and I want
[822.96 - 826.20] to talk about stick around because I'm
[824.40 - 828.78] going to talk about organic versus wild
[826.20 - 830.82] food because people are confused and be
[828.78 - 832.56] like oh it's not organic but what they
[830.82 - 834.54] don't understand
[832.56 - 837.36] and this is important to know
[834.54 - 840.96] when you have or I'm a pro-organic food
[837.36 - 842.76] but I'm also aware that organic crops
[840.96 - 844.40] are sprayed three times a week with
[842.76 - 847.62] pollinator killers
[844.40 - 849.42] organic food crops are sprayed three
[847.62 - 853.38] times a week
[849.42 - 856.20] with pollinator Killers nicotine
[853.38 - 860.04] so don't give me that Holier you're
[856.20 - 862.62] holier than now crap and how this is a
[860.04 - 864.96] wild food and oh why isn't it organic so
[862.62 - 867.06] I'm not going to use that I'm all about
[864.96 - 869.22] organic don't give me that holier than
[867.06 - 871.86] now about that because what happens
[869.22 - 875.76] is people don't realize it that our
[871.86 - 878.34] organic food is also laced
[875.76 - 880.26] it's laced with nicotine
[878.34 - 882.12] MSG
[880.26 - 884.94] and other stuff
[882.12 - 888.66] and what people realize is they have to
[884.94 - 891.90] spray the crap out of organic food or
[888.66 - 895.08] all the aphids come and rip it apart so
[891.90 - 897.00] they're loaded with copper
[895.08 - 899.46] copper in the spray
[897.00 - 901.38] like the toxic copper and organic spray
[899.46 - 904.26] and nicotine
[901.38 - 907.92] so here we are so what I'm saying is
[904.26 - 911.40] that's a wild food that rarely needs to
[907.92 - 914.10] ever be sprayed because a wild food can
[911.40 - 916.68] tend to itself and protect itself a wild
[914.10 - 919.14] food actually protects itself
[916.68 - 920.94] so what that means is rarely does it
[919.14 - 923.58] ever get sprayed and Wyman's will not
[920.94 - 926.10] use a pollinator killer
[923.58 - 929.22] if they ever do need to spray they won't
[926.10 - 932.52] use a pollinator killer what does that
[929.22 - 935.16] mean why here's the difference
[932.52 - 939.12] this wild food they won't kill their
[935.16 - 941.76] bees organic crops they kill their bees
[939.12 - 943.50] important to know right there so they
[941.76 - 946.02] also test
[943.50 - 948.30] and they get zero percent zero percent
[946.02 - 951.32] in their tests of pesticides but guess
[948.30 - 954.60] what your organic food companies
[951.32 - 956.10] won't test to make sure you have zero
[954.60 - 958.26] percent nicotine
[956.10 - 960.72] and zero percent copper
[958.26 - 962.82] from their sprays
[960.72 - 965.70] so every time you see it and I see in
[962.82 - 968.64] the comments that Holier the now stuff
[965.70 - 970.50] like oh it's not organic medical medium
[968.64 - 973.14] doesn't know what he's talking about
[970.50 - 974.04] so let me just give you the 101 right
[973.14 - 976.56] now
[974.04 - 980.34] your organic crops get sprayed with
[976.56 - 982.62] copper toxic copper and toxic nicotine
[980.34 - 984.84] and he ends up killing all the bees and
[982.62 - 987.66] the pollinators and they get sprayed
[984.84 - 991.02] rapidly because organic crops can't take
[987.66 - 992.88] care of itself it's too weak this is a
[991.02 - 994.98] wild food and I eat organic food I'm
[992.88 - 997.92] just telling you this is a wild food
[994.98 - 1001.04] they rarely ever have to spray anything
[997.92 - 1003.38] and if they do they refuse to use a
[1001.04 - 1006.38] pollinator killer and they test it zero
[1003.38 - 1009.26] percent pesticide residue and here's the
[1006.38 - 1012.32] other thing the organic food companies
[1009.26 - 1015.02] they're not testing to make sure you're
[1012.32 - 1017.36] not getting nicotine and copper
[1015.02 - 1020.42] remember that this is an important piece
[1017.36 - 1021.92] of information and it's mind-blowing and
[1020.42 - 1023.78] by the way Wyman's juice is coming to
[1021.92 - 1025.82] Europe early next year and to other
[1023.78 - 1027.98] parts of the world next year or a year
[1025.82 - 1030.14] later so pretty cool
[1027.98 - 1031.82] anyway that's really mind-blowing
[1030.14 - 1033.86] information all on its own and it's
[1031.82 - 1036.08] important to know by the way 10 off

[1188.66 - 1193.70] comment they were like I never heard you
[1191.12 - 1195.74] lip smack before I've never heard you
[1193.70 - 1198.50] lip smack after I had the extractor

[1204.80 - 1209.86] all right oh wait
[1207.44 - 1213.32] I want to address a comment that was
[1209.86 - 1218.66] also mentioned too yesterday okay so the
[1213.32 - 1220.34] comment was this aw you're confusing me
[1218.66 - 1223.04] you said
[1220.34 - 1227.90] that you can have the five ingredients
[1223.04 - 1230.36] in your hmds at any time of day so how
[1227.90 - 1234.20] is it possible you would ruin your
[1230.36 - 1236.84] smoothie if you put in the wrong stuff
[1234.20 - 1239.12] so what that was so that was just
[1236.84 - 1242.00] misunderstood what I was saying was
[1239.12 - 1244.88] don't put things that will ruin your
[1242.00 - 1247.16] smoothie or your health don't put in the
[1244.88 - 1249.26] chlorella the apple cider vinegar the
[1247.16 - 1251.36] charcoal the collagen all these things
[1249.26 - 1252.86] that are not good for us don't put
[1251.36 - 1255.74] chocolate in there all these things that
[1252.86 - 1258.20] should not be in there that do ruin what
[1255.74 - 1259.70] it's trying to do for you because you're
[1258.20 - 1261.92] adding all those things that actually
[1259.70 - 1264.08] complicate the body of the liver put a
[1261.92 - 1265.70] burden on you burden on a system and
[1264.08 - 1266.90] burden on everything that you're trying

[1394.28 - 1399.56] to heal
[1395.36 - 1402.50] it's on page 95 a brain saver
[1399.56 - 1404.78] by the way these books just got released
[1402.50 - 1407.90] and they're just incredible they blow my
[1404.78 - 1409.52] mind constantly honestly you can't even
[1407.90 - 1411.68] like there's so much information in
[1409.52 - 1414.50] these books but every single paragraph
[1411.68 - 1415.82] Just is like mind-blowing it's just
[1414.50 - 1418.46] crazy how it is
[1415.82 - 1422.06] everybody wants to heal
[1418.46 - 1423.92] nobody doesn't want to heal
[1422.06 - 1426.14] you'll hear it out there
[1423.92 - 1428.12] you just don't want to heal that's why
[1426.14 - 1429.68] you're not healing you got a fear of
[1428.12 - 1432.88] healing that's why you're not healing
[1429.68 - 1432.88] have you ever heard that BS
[1433.16 - 1438.08] everybody wants to heal nobody doesn't
[1435.50 - 1440.18] want to heal no one wants to be sick or
[1438.08 - 1441.68] suffering emotionally
[1440.18 - 1445.36] do you want to be sick or suffering
[1441.68 - 1445.36] emotionally nobody does
[1445.40 - 1451.22] no one is afraid of healing
[1448.58 - 1453.98] no one has a fear of healing that's
[1451.22 - 1456.74] secretly holding them back from getting
[1453.98 - 1458.36] better but yet people are told that
[1456.74 - 1460.46] you guys people are told that all the
[1458.36 - 1462.14] time you got uh you have a fear of
[1460.46 - 1464.96] healing it's internally you just know
[1462.14 - 1467.84] you know you just don't know you have a
[1464.96 - 1470.42] fear of healing I am a psychotherapist
[1467.84 - 1472.76] I'm a psychotherapist and I'm telling my
[1470.42 - 1476.42] patient my client you just have a fear
[1472.76 - 1479.60] of healing that's why you're sick still
[1476.42 - 1481.40] you know you hear that all the time
[1479.60 - 1483.76] maybe you guys have heard that before
[1481.40 - 1483.76] right
[1484.28 - 1491.78] we want to heal we want to live forever
[1487.94 - 1494.96] people want to live forever they do they
[1491.78 - 1498.22] do we want to live at our healthiest for
[1494.96 - 1498.22] as long as we can
[1498.98 - 1503.66] there's also a trusting wire within us
[1501.62 - 1505.22] that's been taken advantage of by
[1503.66 - 1509.90] Industries
[1505.22 - 1511.70] trust we have a trusting liar inside of
[1509.90 - 1515.84] us
[1511.70 - 1517.96] it's a trusting wire inside of the brain
[1515.84 - 1521.00] and that trusting wire has been
[1517.96 - 1524.66] manipulated and conditioned
[1521.00 - 1526.82] for a long time by the industries
[1524.66 - 1529.22] the trusting wire is built into the
[1526.82 - 1531.62] neurons inside
[1529.22 - 1534.68] the emotional centers of the brain and
[1531.62 - 1536.96] that trusting wire is a real thing that
[1534.68 - 1538.88] gets manipulated and the think tanks out
[1536.96 - 1541.10] there in the industries love to actually
[1538.88 - 1544.12] control that trusting wire that's inside
[1541.10 - 1544.12] people's brains
[1547.76 - 1552.14] okay this has created a brainwashing
[1550.82 - 1554.84] within us
[1552.14 - 1556.58] a mechanism inside us that wants
[1554.84 - 1558.50] permission to do harmful things to
[1556.58 - 1563.00] ourselves this is interesting right here
[1558.50 - 1564.74] we want permission to harm ourselves
[1563.00 - 1566.42] because once we get permission to harm
[1564.74 - 1567.50] ourselves then we actually feel good
[1566.42 - 1570.38] about it
[1567.50 - 1572.54] and we can then do that
[1570.38 - 1574.34] that's how it works
[1572.54 - 1576.02] we want permission to eat as much
[1574.34 - 1577.76] chocolate as we've ever wanted to eat
[1576.02 - 1579.80] because oh it's good for us that's what
[1577.76 - 1583.52] we're told we want permission to do what
[1579.80 - 1586.16] we want we want permission to moderately
[1583.52 - 1588.80] smoke we want permission
[1586.16 - 1591.02] to smoke as much weed as we ever dreamed
[1588.80 - 1593.12] we can smoke right I'm not no disrespect
[1591.02 - 1596.06] any weed smokers because that's not what
[1593.12 - 1598.76] this is about but we want permission
[1596.06 - 1601.10] to do whatever we want to do
[1598.76 - 1603.56] we do want that permission
[1601.10 - 1605.54] to heart do harmful things to ourselves
[1603.56 - 1607.70] the desire for health is so strong
[1605.54 - 1609.38] inside of us that we'll try to look for
[1607.70 - 1612.80] answers about why anything that's
[1609.38 - 1616.82] harmful could be good for us
[1612.80 - 1620.14] we have this incredible desire
[1616.82 - 1624.98] to want to find something
[1620.14 - 1626.72] valuable in something that's harming us
[1624.98 - 1628.94] it's really incredible
[1626.72 - 1631.82] we want validation that hurting
[1628.94 - 1634.48] ourselves is actually good for us
[1631.82 - 1636.80] this can make it seem as if
[1634.48 - 1639.44] self-sabotage is part of our innate
[1636.80 - 1641.60] emotional nature that's mind-blowing as
[1639.44 - 1643.46] if we want to harm ourselves when we
[1641.60 - 1646.10] really don't we don't want to harm
[1643.46 - 1649.78] ourselves but we're brainwashed
[1646.10 - 1649.78] into thinking we do
[1649.96 - 1655.28] we don't self-sabotage because we want
[1653.18 - 1657.38] to make ourselves sick
[1655.28 - 1660.10] we self-sabotage because we're taught to
[1657.38 - 1660.10] self-sabotage
[1660.20 - 1666.32] if someone is eating all this fast food
[1663.50 - 1668.48] 24 7. there's just there's always fast
[1666.32 - 1671.30] food fast food it's a form of
[1668.48 - 1673.70] self-sabotage to some degree right
[1671.30 - 1675.26] but we're not doing it
[1673.70 - 1678.68] purposely
[1675.26 - 1680.72] right to harm ourselves if somebody
[1678.68 - 1683.36] smokes if somebody smokes weed if
[1680.72 - 1686.20] someone drinks if so I'll have another
[1683.36 - 1686.20] sip right now
[1686.30 - 1692.66] if someone drinks
[1689.36 - 1695.00] they're not doing it to harm themselves
[1692.66 - 1696.74] we self-sabotage because we're taught to
[1695.00 - 1700.06] self-sabotage we're conditioned to
[1696.74 - 1703.28] self-sabotage we're practically bred to
[1700.06 - 1705.74] self-sabotage why am I even reading this
[1703.28 - 1708.14] why am I even talking about this when
[1705.74 - 1709.88] I'm doing a wild blueberry date you of
[1708.14 - 1712.76] the challenge
[1709.88 - 1715.34] because your spiritual powers in this
[1712.76 - 1717.38] blue color right here that enters the
[1715.34 - 1721.16] emotional centers of the brain that
[1717.38 - 1724.24] helps to unwind brain washing from the
[1721.16 - 1726.62] industries that is used to get us to
[1724.24 - 1728.96] self-sabotage ourselves there's a
[1726.62 - 1732.02] rewiring that happens when that blue
[1728.96 - 1734.42] juice hits the brain our brain is like a
[1732.02 - 1736.46] magnet to the blue anthocyanins coming
[1734.42 - 1739.00] off these wild blueberries and going to
[1736.46 - 1739.00] the brain
[1739.52 - 1743.96] foreign
[1741.40 - 1746.36] Cults and I call them Colts because
[1743.96 - 1749.74] they're the Cults because they all speak
[1746.36 - 1749.74] the same thing
[1749.90 - 1757.04] that's how Cults work
[1753.14 - 1759.86] they all say the same thing
[1757.04 - 1762.08] no matter how you slice the pie
[1759.86 - 1765.44] all the different Fabrics of alternative
[1762.08 - 1769.28] medicine all still support and befriend
[1765.44 - 1771.80] the same people the same thing
[1769.28 - 1774.14] because it's one big cult
[1771.80 - 1776.06] alternative medicine Cults as well as
[1774.14 - 1778.70] top feeders and Bottom Feeders of the
[1776.06 - 1781.76] health industry are always catering to
[1778.70 - 1784.94] the self-sabotage brainwashing
[1781.76 - 1787.46] they are they do you'll see it
[1784.94 - 1791.48] you'll see every aspect of alternative
[1787.46 - 1795.50] medicine doesn't want to insult
[1791.48 - 1797.96] a particular group because they all are
[1795.50 - 1800.14] basically working for each other and
[1797.96 - 1803.72] around each other
[1800.14 - 1806.00] trading within each other
[1803.72 - 1808.70] working within each other and that's how
[1806.00 - 1811.54] it is out there it's just a fact it's
[1808.70 - 1811.54] just what it is
[1814.18 - 1817.70] alternative medicine Cults as well as
[1816.26 - 1819.56] top feeders and Bottom Feeders of the
[1817.70 - 1821.96] health industry are always catering to
[1819.56 - 1824.24] the self-sabotage brainwashing how how
[1821.96 - 1825.98] ready
[1824.24 - 1828.20] no you should have all the green tea you
[1825.98 - 1830.06] ever wanted because it's good for you
[1828.20 - 1831.86] and then the next alternative Colt would
[1830.06 - 1833.96] be like yeah green tea is totally fine
[1831.86 - 1835.70] the next Alternative Health cult would
[1833.96 - 1837.32] be like yeah green tea is fine oh yeah
[1835.70 - 1839.60] it's good for you it's got stuff in it
[1837.32 - 1841.34] that's good oh a new study came out and
[1839.60 - 1842.90] then another alternative Colt be like
[1841.34 - 1845.24] green tea is good for you
[1842.90 - 1848.24] and they'll all mimic the same thing oh
[1845.24 - 1850.18] yeah you can have coffee do Organics uh
[1848.24 - 1853.10] you know fair trade do organic coffee
[1850.18 - 1855.44] yeah and you can you know it's all the
[1853.10 - 1857.78] same thing oh you can do cacao all you
[1855.44 - 1859.88] want oh yeah Ayahuasca is all right if
[1857.78 - 1861.50] you do it you know once in a while and
[1859.88 - 1863.90] you're having a spiritual moment and
[1861.50 - 1866.12] you're with the right Shaman you can do
[1863.90 - 1867.98] that too so all mimic the same thing and
[1866.12 - 1870.44] all the Alternative Health Cults because
[1867.98 - 1872.42] they all work together and they all
[1870.44 - 1875.54] speak one language and that's when you
[1872.42 - 1877.40] know it is one big cult right
[1875.54 - 1880.22] I'm talking about this because the wild
[1877.40 - 1883.64] blueberry helps us to break from that
[1880.22 - 1886.34] it helps us to break away from that so
[1883.64 - 1888.44] we have our own mind
[1886.34 - 1890.60] the reason why medical medium
[1888.44 - 1892.52] information is hated so much out there
[1890.60 - 1894.68] because it gives person other person
[1892.52 - 1896.48] their own free will back
[1894.68 - 1898.58] it gives them their own free thinking
[1896.48 - 1900.74] back their own free will it gives them
[1898.58 - 1902.18] answers for the first time so they can
[1900.74 - 1903.98] make decisions and choices for
[1902.18 - 1905.90] themselves that's what it's been all
[1903.98 - 1907.88] about for medical medium information it
[1905.90 - 1910.28] gives the person freedom because when
[1907.88 - 1911.78] you see it out there you're still all
[1910.28 - 1914.06] wrapped up out there and all that other
[1911.78 - 1916.10] cold stuff it's crazy how it works the
[1914.06 - 1918.50] wild blueberry whether somebody knows it
[1916.10 - 1922.54] or not when it's integrated into their
[1918.50 - 1922.54] health can help them break from that
[1923.02 - 1927.82] it's just mind-blowing information in
[1925.64 - 1927.82] here
[1927.98 - 1933.28] so let's just keep on reading I'm going
[1929.96 - 1933.28] to have a little bit of wine real quick
[1933.44 - 1936.80] it's not wine it's wild blueberry juice
[1935.18 - 1938.60] if you just got here
[1936.80 - 1940.76] that's the brain saver book I'm reading
[1938.60 - 1943.76] out out there's two brain saver and the
[1940.76 - 1946.04] Brain saver protocols
[1943.76 - 1948.62] okay
[1946.04 - 1949.70] so often using and here's another thing
[1948.62 - 1951.98] too
[1949.70 - 1953.78] the alternative medicine Cults will
[1951.98 - 1956.12] often use their credentials to
[1953.78 - 1957.62] manipulate our trust
[1956.12 - 1959.66] there's nothing wrong with credentials I
[1957.62 - 1962.42] have a lot of friends with credentials
[1959.66 - 1965.30] a lot of doctor friends with credentials
[1962.42 - 1966.86] right doctors that work for good not for
[1965.30 - 1968.96] evil right
[1966.86 - 1970.52] but a lot of people in the Cults out
[1968.96 - 1973.28] there they use their credentials to
[1970.52 - 1975.14] manipulate people and our trust they
[1973.28 - 1977.66] create their own social media channels
[1975.14 - 1980.00] and give their five tips in 15 minutes
[1977.66 - 1982.46] and in those five tips you'll almost
[1980.00 - 1985.46] always find at least one recommendation
[1982.46 - 1988.10] that provides validation and reassurance
[1985.46 - 1990.68] for self-sabotage
[1988.10 - 1991.88] how freaking despicable when you think
[1990.68 - 1993.92] about it
[1991.88 - 1997.04] because every time I see those five tips
[1993.92 - 2000.10] or ten tips or whatever it is you can
[1997.04 - 2002.62] see in those 510 tips once again the
[2000.10 - 2005.44] same language the same stuff to
[2002.62 - 2007.96] self-sabotage is there
[2005.44 - 2010.24] a big part of the self-sabotage
[2007.96 - 2012.88] brainwashing is that we become
[2010.24 - 2015.58] programmed to seek validation that doing
[2012.88 - 2018.66] a harmful thing in moderation is
[2015.58 - 2018.66] perfectly fine
[2019.36 - 2022.32] exactly
[2022.36 - 2027.52] Leah Collins says aw isn't here to be
[2025.06 - 2030.16] liked or sugarcoat the truth he's here
[2027.52 - 2032.80] to heal and break the false light in the
[2030.16 - 2035.02] medical community and it's so truth so
[2032.80 - 2037.72] that's so true in alternative medical
[2035.02 - 2041.46] community and conventional
[2037.72 - 2041.46] that's what's so crazy about it all
[2044.14 - 2048.76] for The Not So Sick there's there these
[2046.78 - 2050.44] self-sabotage measures are often a daily
[2048.76 - 2052.24] part of everyone's life so here's how it
[2050.44 - 2054.64] works what I mean by The Not So Sick you
[2052.24 - 2057.64] guys you just got here today's day two
[2054.64 - 2059.68] of the wild blueberry challenge I'm
[2057.64 - 2061.42] making a couple of recipes we're having
[2059.68 - 2062.86] some fun but I'm also talking about the
[2061.42 - 2064.90] spiritual powers
[2062.86 - 2066.94] any antioxidants of the wild blueberry
[2064.90 - 2070.36] but I'm talking about it in association
[2066.94 - 2073.36] with the emotional center of the brain
[2070.36 - 2075.58] and how the wild blueberries
[2073.36 - 2077.68] have the power to rise out of the ashes
[2075.58 - 2081.10] allowing us to have the power to rise
[2077.68 - 2083.02] out of mind control
[2081.10 - 2084.64] because that's what's Happening Here on
[2083.02 - 2086.56] planet Earth in the Alternative Health
[2084.64 - 2088.92] movement is people are under mind
[2086.56 - 2088.92] control
[2089.26 - 2092.38] they're told their fish oil is fine
[2090.94 - 2094.12] they're told their krill oil is fine
[2092.38 - 2096.76] which it isn't you guys it's loaded with
[2094.12 - 2099.40] Mercury but they don't realize it
[2096.76 - 2101.74] they're told a lot of things I talk all
[2099.40 - 2104.26] about it in the brain books but yeah
[2101.74 - 2107.68] it's just unbelievable really The Not So
[2104.26 - 2109.60] Sick what The Not So Sick is is look I
[2107.68 - 2111.40] have respect for The Not So Sick the not
[2109.60 - 2113.32] so sick of people that have symptoms but
[2111.40 - 2115.54] it hasn't
[2113.32 - 2116.98] impeded their life in such a way where
[2115.54 - 2120.10] it robs the quality of their life where
[2116.98 - 2121.96] they are in severe severe trouble
[2120.10 - 2123.40] The Not So Sick are people that have a
[2121.96 - 2124.66] couple of different symptoms and they
[2123.40 - 2126.64] run around to different functional
[2124.66 - 2128.08] doctors and regular doctors and they
[2126.64 - 2129.52] just look for things to kind of keep
[2128.08 - 2130.96] them floating and they float along
[2129.52 - 2133.06] because they're not so sick and then
[2130.96 - 2135.58] eventually the scale tips and they go
[2133.06 - 2138.10] down the drain right
[2135.58 - 2140.86] the not so sick
[2138.10 - 2142.66] for The Not So Sick these self-sabotage
[2140.86 - 2144.22] measures are often a daily part of
[2142.66 - 2146.20] everybody's life get ready for this
[2144.22 - 2148.36] coffee that's a daily part of
[2146.20 - 2151.12] everybody's life who's not so sick
[2148.36 - 2153.76] they could just still do coffee vinegar
[2151.12 - 2155.86] that's another thing in their daily life
[2153.76 - 2158.68] that's a self-sabotage
[2155.86 - 2161.44] weapon right there is vinegar ages you
[2158.68 - 2163.96] fast dissolves your teeth breaks your
[2161.44 - 2165.34] immune system down breaks your nervous
[2163.96 - 2167.92] system down
[2165.34 - 2169.78] wine that's one right there
[2167.92 - 2172.84] as long as you have a couple of glasses
[2169.78 - 2175.00] on the weekend everything should be fine
[2172.84 - 2176.74] yeah moderation
[2175.00 - 2178.18] for that for The Not So Sick somebody
[2176.74 - 2180.52] that just has like a thyroid problem
[2178.18 - 2182.14] that they're managing or something
[2180.52 - 2183.28] or they got some hot flashes or
[2182.14 - 2184.66] something and they're just you know they
[2183.28 - 2186.40] go to their doctors and they're like
[2184.66 - 2187.84] whoa I whatever they can still drink
[2186.40 - 2190.56] their wine on the weekends right they're
[2187.84 - 2190.56] not so sick
[2191.50 - 2195.64] so pizza that's another one The Not So
[2194.14 - 2196.90] Sick can eat pizza all the time they
[2195.64 - 2199.24] could have it on Friday nights they
[2196.90 - 2201.28] could have it on Saturday night fried
[2199.24 - 2203.80] and greasy food they can engage in that
[2201.28 - 2205.96] too whether it's alternative fried and
[2203.80 - 2207.82] greasy food whether it's vegan fried or
[2205.96 - 2209.56] greasy food whether it's vegan pizza
[2207.82 - 2211.90] they can still partake in it because
[2209.56 - 2214.78] they're not so sick if we hear these are
[2211.90 - 2217.42] not good for us we look for someone else
[2214.78 - 2220.06] to say it is good for you in moderation
[2217.42 - 2222.64] as long as it's vegan your pizza should
[2220.06 - 2225.28] be fine in moderation because you're not
[2222.64 - 2227.20] so sick yet so you can handle it as long
[2225.28 - 2229.72] as you've got your wine once on the
[2227.20 - 2232.18] weekend hey fine you can handle it
[2229.72 - 2235.00] you're not so sick yet
[2232.18 - 2237.28] we don't want to face the reality of
[2235.00 - 2240.28] what we're really doing we don't want to
[2237.28 - 2243.04] pay the consequences of osteopenia
[2240.28 - 2245.08] coming from vinegar liver conditions
[2243.04 - 2246.88] coming from alcohol adrenal problems
[2245.08 - 2249.16] coming from caffeine like I was talking
[2246.88 - 2251.14] about you guys so we'll never accept
[2249.16 - 2253.60] that these are the true causes of these
[2251.14 - 2256.30] conditions it's as if in Industry
[2253.60 - 2258.94] conditioning has placed a robot inside
[2256.30 - 2261.34] us that wants validation to slowly
[2258.94 - 2263.32] destroy ourselves even though that's the
[2261.34 - 2266.08] last thing we really want we want
[2263.32 - 2268.42] validation for the industry
[2266.08 - 2270.52] to keep on feeding us these things so we
[2268.42 - 2272.20] can destroy ourselves we want validation
[2270.52 - 2273.70] to destroy ourselves even though that's
[2272.20 - 2278.52] not what we really want we've been
[2273.70 - 2278.52] brainwashed to think that's what we want
[2278.74 - 2283.84] we want to be healthy and strong and
[2281.02 - 2285.16] live forever right I see that all the
[2283.84 - 2287.20] time we want to be healthy and strong
[2285.16 - 2288.94] and live forever under certain
[2287.20 - 2290.98] conditions
[2288.94 - 2293.20] some of these conditions are I'm going
[2290.98 - 2297.46] to have my dark chocolate and coffee and
[2293.20 - 2299.20] vinegar and wine and champagne and salt
[2297.46 - 2300.82] I don't know what all this business is
[2299.20 - 2305.20] about in this book
[2300.82 - 2307.96] hmm I do perfectly fine in my wine
[2305.20 - 2311.38] you can't stop me
[2307.96 - 2314.74] I'm on page 95 you guys you can't stop
[2311.38 - 2318.52] me you can't tell me I can't
[2314.74 - 2321.22] and I'm about to go to page 96.
[2318.52 - 2323.38] because I'll go and find someone who's a
[2321.22 - 2325.42] health authority who says it's fine and
[2323.38 - 2328.42] even good for me to eat all that plus
[2325.42 - 2330.52] raw aged cheese and grass-fed butter and
[2328.42 - 2334.54] green tea and matcha and Kombucha tea
[2330.52 - 2336.82] and eggs and I'll run with that
[2334.54 - 2338.68] we're taught to self-sabotage by the
[2336.82 - 2341.08] industry
[2338.68 - 2342.70] all those things are bad for us and if
[2341.08 - 2344.56] you're not so sick you can play in that
[2342.70 - 2346.66] game and keep on self-sabotaging and
[2344.56 - 2348.88] keep on being taught to self-sabotage
[2346.66 - 2350.38] but you're never free
[2348.88 - 2353.44] you're
[2350.38 - 2356.02] part of what they want
[2353.44 - 2358.00] the industry and why am I saying this
[2356.02 - 2359.86] again because the wild blueberry gets
[2358.00 - 2362.50] into the consciousness of Consciousness
[2359.86 - 2365.02] it gets into the soul it gets into the
[2362.50 - 2367.24] physical brain and it starts to rewire
[2365.02 - 2370.78] us the wild blueberry has the ability to
[2367.24 - 2375.36] rewire us and to shed that brainwashing
[2370.78 - 2375.36] it is the anti-brainwashing food
[2378.70 - 2383.68] that will give me the comfy warm fuzzy
[2381.28 - 2385.54] feeling inside that I've been validated
[2383.68 - 2388.84] for doing these things that are actually
[2385.54 - 2391.48] helping destroy my body
[2388.84 - 2393.82] I'll even convince myself that my body
[2391.48 - 2396.58] loves it my body loves chocolate so much
[2393.82 - 2399.28] I crave it my body must love chocolate
[2396.58 - 2402.28] my body loves vinegar I love it on
[2399.28 - 2404.50] everything my body loves eggs I crave
[2402.28 - 2408.42] them they're so good for me
[2404.50 - 2408.42] my body likes all these things
[2409.66 - 2414.22] and my body's fine with it and my body
[2412.24 - 2416.08] needs it this brainwashing and
[2414.22 - 2418.72] conditioning
[2416.08 - 2421.00] becomes woven into the emotional centers
[2418.72 - 2424.06] of our brain it also gets directed
[2421.00 - 2425.80] mostly to women kind on purpose and
[2424.06 - 2428.20] here's how it works
[2425.80 - 2430.06] the systems in the industries brainwash
[2428.20 - 2433.60] women kind
[2430.06 - 2435.40] so that women kind believes they need
[2433.60 - 2437.56] all these things that are actually
[2435.40 - 2439.12] helping to destroy their body and if
[2437.56 - 2440.98] they're not so sick they can keep on
[2439.12 - 2443.02] partaking in it and the minute they get
[2440.98 - 2445.54] too sick too sick no one's there to tell
[2443.02 - 2447.76] them how to get out of it except medical
[2445.54 - 2451.30] medium information which is that alone
[2447.76 - 2452.86] is just crazy because why haven't the
[2451.30 - 2455.68] other alternative
[2452.86 - 2458.20] parts of the industries in the health
[2455.68 - 2459.76] industry figured all this out yet yeah
[2458.20 - 2461.38] they'll poach a little tidbit for
[2459.76 - 2463.06] medical medium here and there and you'll
[2461.38 - 2466.30] see somebody squeak it out once in a
[2463.06 - 2469.78] while but the alternative industry
[2466.30 - 2471.94] make sure it allows the not so sick
[2469.78 - 2474.10] people to keep on staying brainwashed
[2471.94 - 2476.68] and partake in all the products and
[2474.10 - 2478.60] guess what and on top of that the
[2476.68 - 2479.94] alternative industry sells it all to
[2478.60 - 2482.32] them
[2479.94 - 2484.00] sells women kind all the chocolate in
[2482.32 - 2486.22] the dark chocolate sells women kind all
[2484.00 - 2487.96] the matcha tea sells women kind all the
[2486.22 - 2489.28] Kombucha Tea which is really turns the
[2487.96 - 2492.28] blood into straight acid I've been
[2489.28 - 2494.08] saying that for 30 years sells all this
[2492.28 - 2499.30] stuff to women kind
[2494.08 - 2499.30] so women kind can slowly decline
[2504.28 - 2508.60] yet the emotional centers of our brain
[2506.38 - 2510.40] can only be pushed so far when you're
[2508.60 - 2512.08] sick or suffering enough physically
[2510.40 - 2513.82] mentally or emotionally a survival
[2512.08 - 2514.96] mechanism kicks into that happen to you
[2513.82 - 2517.06] guys
[2514.96 - 2518.62] who have been real sick
[2517.06 - 2521.62] did that ever happen to you guys where
[2518.62 - 2523.60] where literally something overrode the
[2521.62 - 2525.58] brainwashing and you said find medical
[2523.60 - 2527.56] meme information or an angel put medical
[2525.58 - 2529.90] meme information in front of you or
[2527.56 - 2532.00] something something happened and you
[2529.90 - 2534.16] guys felt it right when you're sick or
[2532.00 - 2536.80] suffering enough emotionally physically
[2534.16 - 2538.90] or anything mentally a survival
[2536.80 - 2541.12] mechanism kicks in did it kick in on you
[2538.90 - 2543.64] guys that survival mechanism did it hit
[2541.12 - 2545.98] a survival mechanism in your brain's
[2543.64 - 2548.74] emotional centers that has been inside
[2545.98 - 2550.84] of us since the beginning of time a
[2548.74 - 2554.40] survival mechanism beginning a time now
[2550.84 - 2554.40] check this out get ready for this
[2554.68 - 2559.74] these wild blueberries have been here
[2556.60 - 2559.74] since the beginning of time
[2560.20 - 2566.38] tens of thousands hundreds of thousands
[2563.56 - 2568.24] millions of years ago the wild blueberry
[2566.38 - 2570.34] has been here
[2568.24 - 2576.00] and there's been a mechanism built
[2570.34 - 2576.00] inside of us since the beginning of time
[2576.04 - 2581.62] that gets tripped up and we're finally
[2579.10 - 2583.96] done I'm done
[2581.62 - 2586.30] with the brainwashing

[2586.30 - 2590.40] I need to heal I've suffered enough
[2590.50 - 2597.16] that survival mechanism says no

[2599.92 - 2604.24] weekends is not good for me I'm

[2644.50 - 2650.14] to mess around now I can't play games
[2646.90 - 2652.54] anymore something Clicks in
[2650.14 - 2654.58] it's a survival mechanism that started
[2652.54 - 2657.12] at the beginning of time with the wild
[2654.58 - 2657.12] blueberry
[2657.52 - 2661.60] where you once learned it's not good for
[2659.80 - 2663.58] you something Clicks in where you once
[2661.60 - 2665.50] learn it's not good you know it's time
[2663.58 - 2668.02] to stay away from that caffeine in the
[2665.50 - 2670.54] vinegar and the salt all the salt and

[2675.46 - 2680.74] destroy myself anymore
[2678.34 - 2683.02] I can't search for validation to support
[2680.74 - 2685.06] something that's harming me from the
[2683.02 - 2687.40] Cults out there
[2685.06 - 2689.86] from the vinegar cult and the chocolate
[2687.40 - 2692.44] Colts out there and the all that the
[2689.86 - 2694.84] cacao Cults and everything all the Cults
[2692.44 - 2698.80] and Ayahuasca Colts and all the smoking
[2694.84 - 2701.62] cults and the alcohol cults
[2698.80 - 2703.60] right and all of it and above something
[2701.62 - 2706.30] inside of you says I'm not going to
[2703.60 - 2708.40] partake in the cult anymore that's out
[2706.30 - 2710.08] there I don't want to destroy myself
[2708.40 - 2712.54] anymore I've been through hell and back
[2710.08 - 2715.32] I've suffered enough I've been sick I
[2712.54 - 2715.32] can't take it anymore
[2715.42 - 2721.18] I've been pushed around too much
[2717.88 - 2723.52] I've been toyed with too much
[2721.18 - 2726.58] I'm not in the business of destroying
[2723.52 - 2729.16] myself anymore because I want to live I
[2726.58 - 2730.72] want to heal I'm not afraid to heal I've
[2729.16 - 2733.42] never been I've never been afraid to
[2730.72 - 2736.42] heal and it's time
[2733.42 - 2738.58] why am I saying all this
[2736.42 - 2742.24] on blueberry day
[2738.58 - 2744.34] whoop pardon me on wild blueberry day
[2742.24 - 2748.24] because a blueberry can't do anything
[2744.34 - 2751.00] for us like a wild blueberry can
[2748.24 - 2753.04] this is a wild food
[2751.00 - 2754.66] it has lived for thousands upon
[2753.04 - 2756.16] thousands of years
[2754.66 - 2759.64] it wasn't
[2756.16 - 2764.32] grafted into some kind of thing and then
[2759.64 - 2768.48] plant it to be cultivated it is wild
[2764.32 - 2768.48] and it Harbors information
[2769.06 - 2772.66] what happens in us when that wire gets
[2771.16 - 2774.76] tripped and we're done with the Colts
[2772.66 - 2778.12] and we're we're totally awake and we
[2774.76 - 2781.24] really truly became awake
[2778.12 - 2783.04] this enough is enough strength inside of
[2781.24 - 2785.26] everyone it starts to kick in it's the
[2783.04 - 2787.00] moment when you put your foot down it's
[2785.26 - 2789.28] the moment when you truly find yourself
[2787.00 - 2791.56] when you're working with and aligned
[2789.28 - 2793.78] with your body that's what the wild
[2791.56 - 2796.60] blueberry is about it's about aligning
[2793.78 - 2798.16] with our body it's about taking the
[2796.60 - 2800.26] subconscious's Consciousness and the
[2798.16 - 2803.68] soul and the physical brain and making
[2800.26 - 2806.92] it become one so it's not fragmented
[2803.68 - 2808.90] not even the snakiest salesman on social
[2806.92 - 2812.80] media videos or the sneakiest
[2808.90 - 2815.62] chiropractor doctor or nutritionist
[2812.80 - 2818.14] on The snakiest infomercials can give
[2815.62 - 2821.08] you the validation anymore to go into
[2818.14 - 2824.02] the robotic mode of I'm going to destroy
[2821.08 - 2826.30] myself with a smile on my face
[2824.02 - 2828.82] and be happy thinking about it
[2826.30 - 2830.38] because my body deserves and needs what
[2828.82 - 2832.72] I'm putting in it
[2830.38 - 2835.18] that old brainwashing that manipulated
[2832.72 - 2836.98] your trusty wire and sent a message to
[2835.18 - 2838.78] your brain's emotional centers to
[2836.98 - 2841.12] override Common Sense and Sensibility
[2838.78 - 2843.04] about what your body really needs that
[2841.12 - 2845.68] brainwashing won't work anymore
[2843.04 - 2848.26] even if everyone around you has been
[2845.68 - 2849.88] brainwashed and they challenge you as
[2848.26 - 2852.34] you start trying to eat healthy get

[2878.20 - 2882.52] time

[2882.52 - 2886.54] Reborn
[2884.14 - 2888.70] it's The Rebirth of finally moving out
[2886.54 - 2890.86] of that mental and emotional pain moving
[2888.70 - 2892.36] out of that in between and turning your
[2890.86 - 2895.24] life around
[2892.36 - 2897.58] and that reminds me

[2897.58 - 2902.50] it's Reborn
[2899.44 - 2903.40] it comes out of the ashes you can't kill
[2902.50 - 2905.56] it
[2903.40 - 2908.56] and then it's there for us
[2905.56 - 2910.90] and it's that spiritual power it holds
[2908.56 - 2913.18] that blue color is an anthocyan and it's
[2910.90 - 2915.88] different than any other anthocyanin and
[2913.18 - 2918.72] it goes to the brain and it heads into
[2915.88 - 2921.16] the emotional center of the brain and it
[2918.72 - 2922.84] rewires us

[3092.64 - 3097.44] quite amazing
[3094.50 - 3101.42] all right let's take a look
[3097.44 - 3101.42] warm wild blueberry Bowl right there
[3101.46 - 3105.78] that's what we're making let's get
[3103.26 - 3108.84] started right now
[3105.78 - 3110.52] this is getting hot I have my little
[3108.84 - 3114.42] griddle on
[3110.52 - 3117.00] I got my ingredient list here four cups
[3114.42 - 3119.52] of wild blueberries are going in there
[3117.00 - 3122.24] so let's do that now and get a little
[3119.52 - 3122.24] measuring cup
[3122.70 - 3126.84] so I have my little measuring cup so
[3124.56 - 3129.72] we're going to do four cups
[3126.84 - 3130.74] so let's do that you know grogu your
[3129.72 - 3132.80] your
[3130.74 - 3132.80] um
[3132.96 - 3136.62] your little vessel that you're in tends
[3135.18 - 3139.94] to move around because it's floating
[3136.62 - 3139.94] right with the force
[3140.04 - 3145.82] all right so let's get some wild
[3142.56 - 3145.82] blueberries in here now
[3147.30 - 3151.92] so we want four cups in this recipe are
[3150.42 - 3153.48] you guys doing this with me because
[3151.92 - 3155.46] that'd be amazing there's two cups right
[3153.48 - 3159.08] there
[3155.46 - 3159.08] let's go with four cups
[3159.78 - 3163.44] now what I love about the wild blueberry
[3161.64 - 3165.60] and we're gonna still talk about the
[3163.44 - 3166.56] anthocyanins a little bit more as well
[3165.60 - 3170.04] and we're going to talk about
[3166.56 - 3173.10] antioxidants too not all antioxidants
[3170.04 - 3176.10] are the same not all people are the same
[3173.10 - 3178.44] not all water is the same
[3176.10 - 3181.38] that's something to know
[3178.44 - 3182.94] and certainly not all antioxidants are
[3181.38 - 3186.18] the same
[3182.94 - 3188.52] now this is a wild food
[3186.18 - 3190.38] it's entirely different than a
[3188.52 - 3192.36] cultivated Berry
[3190.38 - 3194.10] let's go with four cups we got it in
[3192.36 - 3195.48] there
[3194.10 - 3197.04] right
[3195.48 - 3200.60] half cup
[3197.04 - 3200.60] of pure maple syrup
[3201.00 - 3207.92] and I'm about to get that right now
[3203.76 - 3207.92] I got some maple syrup right here
[3208.02 - 3210.92] amazing
[3210.96 - 3217.32] let's go with a half cup a half a cup
[3213.78 - 3219.80] here let's do that nice
[3217.32 - 3219.80] okay
[3223.92 - 3227.60] it's a little bit of maple syrup
[3229.02 - 3231.86] incredible
[3232.20 - 3236.52] got a little bit of that in there
[3234.78 - 3239.34] nice
[3236.52 - 3242.22] all right one and a half tablespoons of
[3239.34 - 3244.26] arrowroot powder We're not gonna do that
[3242.22 - 3246.18] yet we're just gonna warm this up and
[3244.26 - 3248.94] get it going
[3246.18 - 3251.04] I'm gonna put the lid on okay you guys
[3248.94 - 3252.36] and then we're gonna make some

[3300.66 - 3305.58] medical medium so I can share it too
[3303.08 - 3308.52] what was your experience with wild
[3305.58 - 3310.98] blueberries did you have it in the hmds
[3308.52 - 3313.26] all these years did you have an
[3310.98 - 3314.88] experience with it along the way do you
[3313.26 - 3317.28] love your wild blueberries that's
[3314.88 - 3319.80] another thing all on its own
[3317.28 - 3324.18] so that's important too so I'm just
[3319.80 - 3326.52] making sure that I have that heating up
[3324.18 - 3327.84] now
[3326.52 - 3331.46] there we go
[3327.84 - 3331.46] now the warm wild blueberry Bowl
[3331.86 - 3338.12] is a special one
[3334.74 - 3338.12] I really love it
[3339.84 - 3343.76] I'm going to take this lid and move it
[3343.98 - 3349.02] you know my favorite thing is it's not
[3346.20 - 3350.76] just this wild blueberry challenge
[3349.02 - 3354.00] like one of my favorite things is
[3350.76 - 3355.62] starting to like cook and do stuff you
[3354.00 - 3358.20] know like this because this is what I
[3355.62 - 3359.52] love right so I want to do more lives in
[3358.20 - 3360.72] the future where I'm making some of the
[3359.52 - 3362.94] recipes out of these books which I'm
[3360.72 - 3364.26] excited about too so I'm looking forward
[3362.94 - 3365.88] to that
[3364.26 - 3369.24] now
[3365.88 - 3372.84] when it comes down to anthocyanins
[3369.24 - 3375.84] you're looking at amphocyanins with a
[3372.84 - 3379.34] real rich rich blue color that purple
[3375.84 - 3381.72] blue color okay now
[3379.34 - 3383.94] anthocyanins for different parts of the
[3381.72 - 3385.92] body like they go in different places in
[3383.94 - 3388.32] the body and what I love about the wild
[3385.92 - 3391.74] blueberry anthocyanins
[3388.32 - 3394.74] is this information I got from SOC is
[3391.74 - 3399.00] because of that rich color that deep
[3394.74 - 3401.16] deep blue color the anthocyanins are not
[3399.00 - 3403.08] designed to just go like
[3401.16 - 3404.70] in one specific like they're not
[3403.08 - 3408.42] designed to just go everywhere they're
[3404.70 - 3409.74] designed to head to the Noggin that's
[3408.42 - 3412.10] where they head
[3409.74 - 3417.06] okay because that blue color that
[3412.10 - 3420.48] anthocyanin is geared for metaphysical
[3417.06 - 3422.76] and physical that's the whole point so
[3420.48 - 3424.68] when you see that deep blue color what
[3422.76 - 3426.72] you're seeing is metaphysical and that's
[3424.68 - 3429.24] what you have to think
[3426.72 - 3430.92] so I am going to get some arrowroot
[3429.24 - 3433.98] powder
[3430.92 - 3436.26] and uh one and a half tablespoons of
[3433.98 - 3438.66] water
[3436.26 - 3440.76] and get that in here I will try not to
[3438.66 - 3443.04] spill it on the book
[3440.76 - 3445.46] there's one tablespoon I'm going to do a
[3443.04 - 3445.46] half now
[3446.46 - 3450.24] perfect
[3448.92 - 3452.66] [Music]
[3450.24 - 3452.66] okay
[3456.42 - 3461.36] very interesting so I'm going to mix
[3459.00 - 3461.36] this up
[3465.00 - 3470.64] so this is the warm while the blueberry
[3468.90 - 3472.56] Bowl
[3470.64 - 3474.18] now I notice people will say like I
[3472.56 - 3476.76] don't have wild blueberries
[3474.18 - 3478.62] so I'm gonna use
[3476.76 - 3481.68] regular blueberry
[3478.62 - 3483.96] if you can't find a wild blueberry don't
[3481.68 - 3486.30] use a regular blueberry a cultivated
[3483.96 - 3488.04] regular blueberry won't cut it if you're
[3486.30 - 3489.96] looking for something Madison more
[3488.04 - 3490.92] medicinal and you can't find the wild
[3489.96 - 3494.04] blueberry
[3490.92 - 3497.46] then go with blackberries
[3494.04 - 3499.44] it's not going to do the same thing
[3497.46 - 3503.70] right it's not going to do the same
[3499.44 - 3505.98] thing but it's a step above your
[3503.70 - 3507.84] cultivated blueberry
[3505.98 - 3509.76] because a lot of people they'll just run
[3507.84 - 3511.38] to the store they don't really know
[3509.76 - 3513.06] anything about the wild liver they don't
[3511.38 - 3514.62] know anything about what's going on and
[3513.06 - 3516.72] they're uncertain like incredible let me
[3514.62 - 3518.88] just go get some blueberries it's not
[3516.72 - 3521.06] the same thing so that's important to
[3518.88 - 3521.06] know
[3523.44 - 3526.04] okay
[3526.20 - 3530.40] now I'm going to add this in
[3528.48 - 3531.90] so what you see here is the arrowroot
[3530.40 - 3533.70] starch
[3531.90 - 3536.28] okay
[3533.70 - 3539.60] I added a little bit of water to it
[3536.28 - 3539.60] and then it's going in now
[3541.62 - 3544.28] wonderful
[3546.00 - 3549.56] and now I'm going to Stir It
[3552.96 - 3555.72] I don't know how easy you can see this
[3554.88 - 3559.76] but
[3555.72 - 3559.76] there you are hey look at that
[3568.14 - 3573.78] fantastic
[3570.66 - 3575.70] let that get a little hotter
[3573.78 - 3577.44] I don't want to call I put them in they
[3575.70 - 3578.88] were already chilled the blueberries the
[3577.44 - 3581.22] wild blueberries were already some of
[3578.88 - 3584.24] them were frozen still I'm gonna cook it
[3581.22 - 3584.24] for about one more minute
[3587.88 - 3591.78] yep
[3589.98 - 3593.64] because you want your you want it to be
[3591.78 - 3596.34] a warm wild blueberry Bowl you don't
[3593.64 - 3598.32] want it to be a cold wild Livery Bowl
[3596.34 - 3599.94] because that will happen especially if
[3598.32 - 3602.52] you take them out of the freezer
[3599.94 - 3607.02] you want to make sure they're warm and
[3602.52 - 3610.04] nice and comfy and warm and fuzzy
[3607.02 - 3610.04] which is incredible
[3613.02 - 3619.34] and I'm going to get them ready now to
[3615.60 - 3619.34] serve if you guys don't mind
[3620.64 - 3625.34] and then next we're going to be making
[3621.90 - 3625.34] the wild blueberry latte
[3629.58 - 3632.58] grogu
[3632.94 - 3638.72] every time grogu gets Disturbed grogu
[3635.58 - 3638.72] sends me a telepathic message
[3641.40 - 3644.22] okay
[3642.54 - 3647.76] I'm trying to use here's the thing I'm
[3644.22 - 3650.88] trying to use the wild blueberry to help
[3647.76 - 3651.90] with the brain the emotional centers of
[3650.88 - 3654.48] the brain
[3651.90 - 3656.04] and grogu is sitting there sending
[3654.48 - 3657.66] telepathic messages to the emotional
[3656.04 - 3659.94] centers the brain to cause pain but
[3657.66 - 3662.28] that's the great thing right I have
[3659.94 - 3665.46] something to battle that that's right

[4151.46 - 4154.70] so I don't want to do it the lazy way
[4152.96 - 4156.86] today because I make this for myself all
[4154.70 - 4159.08] the time but I do it like the quick and
[4156.86 - 4161.18] lazy way
[4159.08 - 4162.62] I wouldn't call Lazy whatever I just
[4161.18 - 4165.34] like whatever I slap it together
[4162.62 - 4168.44] whatever you want to call it
[4165.34 - 4170.62] and but I want to do it like to the

[4192.32 - 4195.44] I don't make it all the time all the
[4193.94 - 4198.44] time I just make it for guests that come
[4195.44 - 4200.36] and then then usually I just slap it
[4198.44 - 4203.32] together but like I want to like do it
[4200.36 - 4203.32] really nice right now
[4205.64 - 4211.22] so I make it when guests are
[4209.12 - 4215.86] coming and then when they try it they go

[4287.30 - 4292.10] light infusion meditation that is in
[4290.18 - 4294.68] these books and I did that right there
[4292.10 - 4298.10] on the medical game podcast and I have a
[4294.68 - 4299.66] new podcast episode coming out next week
[4298.10 - 4301.28] which is going to be awesome really
[4299.66 - 4302.54] awesome too
[4301.28 - 4306.22] all right we're just getting this ready
[4302.54 - 4306.22] this is the wild blueberry latte
[4308.18 - 4312.26] amazing how you guys doing did you have
[4309.98 - 4314.80] your shots
[4312.26 - 4314.80] foreign
[4321.32 - 4323.98] all right
[4327.14 - 4331.40] now the thing is is that
[4329.48 - 4334.46] if you
[4331.40 - 4336.74] are wondering like why do I love the
[4334.46 - 4338.66] wild blueberries so much
[4336.74 - 4341.72] there's so many reasons it's hard to
[4338.66 - 4343.28] keep them all in all like count it
[4341.72 - 4345.32] because there's that many reasons
[4343.28 - 4346.64] because you're looking at extremely high
[4345.32 - 4348.44] antioxidants
[4346.64 - 4350.60] what does that mean when you have
[4348.44 - 4353.54] extremely high antioxidants
[4350.60 - 4355.64] helping the body to stop oxidizing what
[4353.54 - 4358.70] happens when the body's oxidizing or
[4355.64 - 4361.52] slowly dying or quickly dying
[4358.70 - 4364.58] So the faster somebody's oxidative rate
[4361.52 - 4366.14] is inside their body the faster they're
[4364.58 - 4368.78] dying
[4366.14 - 4372.28] so that's really what it comes down to
[4368.78 - 4374.54] yes you can have a lot of things
[4372.28 - 4375.62] oxidizing you right so I talk about that
[4374.54 - 4377.06] in the medical meeting books you can
[4375.62 - 4379.82] have a lot of different things that are
[4377.06 - 4381.62] oxidizing and breaking down the body
[4379.82 - 4385.04] so everybody's different they might have
[4381.62 - 4388.64] more oxidation than somebody else
[4385.04 - 4390.62] but oxidation is what breaks this down
[4388.64 - 4392.06] and it shortens our life one way or
[4390.62 - 4395.00] another regardless of what's Happening
[4392.06 - 4396.32] inside our bodies you guys I'm going to
[4395.00 - 4400.04] make a little announcement right here

[4547.34 - 4553.24] top of Roku right here
[4550.46 - 4553.24] nice
[4562.70 - 4570.34] get another little saucepan on
[4566.54 - 4570.34] I'm going to pour this into a cup
[4582.98 - 4587.66] so it's not done yet though you guys
[4585.68 - 4592.66] that's the wild blueberry latte
[4587.66 - 4592.66] in motion it's not done so there we go
[4597.68 - 4604.06] now I'm a I'm gonna froth
[4600.02 - 4604.06] this up or episode wait a second
[4604.16 - 4609.40] I'm going to put it in the pan first
[4606.80 - 4609.40] all right
[4614.78 - 4619.88] okay just want enough in there
[4617.56 - 4622.06] we're doing it we're heating it up right
[4619.88 - 4622.06] now
[4622.22 - 4627.50] now I don't want to turn this blue what
[4624.80 - 4629.48] happens is if we have so much blue juice
[4627.50 - 4631.22] around and everything else like that you
[4629.48 - 4634.16] don't want to turn it blue so I'm going
[4631.22 - 4637.70] to get a new utensil because I've done
[4634.16 - 4640.94] this before where I turned
[4637.70 - 4643.18] it blew and you just want you don't want
[4640.94 - 4643.18] that
[4647.78 - 4650.02] okay
[4651.32 - 4654.88] it's kind of breaking it up a little bit
[4661.34 - 4665.12] hmm
[4663.62 - 4667.28] if you guys just came on here I'm making
[4665.12 - 4668.78] the wild blueberry
[4667.28 - 4670.64] latte
[4668.78 - 4672.98] from brain saver
[4670.64 - 4675.50] I want to show you what it looks like I
[4672.98 - 4677.96] don't think I did that yet I might have
[4675.50 - 4680.36] here it is this is what I'm making right
[4677.96 - 4683.68] now you guys
[4680.36 - 4683.68] the wild blueberry latte
[4685.12 - 4691.66] since I'm such a snob
[4688.40 - 4691.66] I like my lattes
[4698.18 - 4701.92] just heating up the milk
[4702.40 - 4707.38] non-dairy this is coconut milk right

[4718.04 - 4720.64] that's next
[4723.14 - 4726.62] it's getting a little bit hotter because
[4724.88 - 4728.54] you want that heat to get into it
[4726.62 - 4731.66] because when you get the heat into it
[4728.54 - 4734.42] you can froth it up better
[4731.66 - 4738.14] if it's not really warm enough you can't
[4734.42 - 4741.22] give it that froth that you got to do
[4738.14 - 4741.22] just about there
[4742.22 - 4746.62] and I got this little frothing tool

[4848.24 - 4852.56] now what you want to do is you want to
[4849.80 - 4855.62] put this gently in here you don't want
[4852.56 - 4858.20] to just push it all in there one shot
[4855.62 - 4860.74] you just want to kind of have it gently
[4858.20 - 4860.74] go in
[4861.44 - 4864.04] like this
[4868.34 - 4873.58] you don't want to mix the two you don't
[4870.98 - 4879.20] want the blue
[4873.58 - 4881.00] mixing with the froth the coconut froth
[4879.20 - 4884.20] how high you want to bring it to the top
[4881.00 - 4884.20] is totally up to you
[4884.54 - 4890.42] I'm going to bring it up really high
[4887.72 - 4892.46] so that froth is kind of like right up
[4890.42 - 4894.74] there whoa
[4892.46 - 4897.62] that's insane
[4894.74 - 4899.54] that is just insane
[4897.62 - 4900.80] I'm really proud of myself right now you
[4899.54 - 4902.18] guys
[4900.80 - 4905.20] seriously I'm gonna sprinkle a little
[4902.18 - 4905.20] bit of cinnamon on top
[4905.42 - 4911.68] you don't want to overdo it
[4908.90 - 4911.68] darn
[4911.78 - 4917.42] it's not what I wanted to do I wanted to
[4914.66 - 4921.64] sprinkle it everywhere on top
[4917.42 - 4921.64] and not in just one shot like that
[4924.80 - 4929.02] that's how it was supposed to be done
[4926.54 - 4929.02] right there
[4929.96 - 4934.66] you live and learn I'm only human
[4935.00 - 4940.94] that is

[4946.58 - 4952.88] it's like you're not self-sabotaging
[4949.94 - 4956.06] it's you're not like you're not
[4952.88 - 4957.98] brainwashed out there to self-sabotage
[4956.06 - 4959.48] with all the addictions that we don't
[4957.98 - 4961.94] even know we have
[4959.48 - 4964.34] we're far from it
[4961.94 - 4967.52] this is entirely different
[4964.34 - 4968.78] and the wild blueberry has so much to do
[4967.52 - 4971.12] with it
[4968.78 - 4976.04] because it gets to our brain it rewires
[4971.12 - 4978.80] us and it stops us from being a toy
[4976.04 - 4980.36] it stops us from being a tool for the
[4978.80 - 4981.92] industries
