15
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,120

111
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:53,280
so right now i'm in the knowing the

112
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:56,480
cause and the protocol

113
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,560
knowing the cause and the protocol

114
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,920
you know what happens a friend of mine

115
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,200
he goes out and gets all the health

116
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,879
books out there he's looking at all the

117
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,720
health books out there he gets this one

118
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,319
he gets this one by some doctor

119
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,319
so-and-so or he gets this health book

120
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:11,280
out here and he says how come

121
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:13,280
they don't have specific dosages

122
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,519
specific protocols and i always say

123
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,600
because they don't know the protocols

124
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:19,759
they don't know why people are sick

125
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,000
and how come they don't talk about why

126
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,120
someone's really sick why do they have

127
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,560
eczema

128
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,240
and he grabs all the different health

129
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,639
books out there for fun and he reads and

130
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,280
he goes i can't find one health book

131
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:34,080
that explains why someone actually has

132
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,199
eczema and then a protocol on how to

133
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,720
heal

134
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,160
because there is none

135
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,320
there is none

136
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,680
this is the first that's ever been done

137
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,320
and that's why i was the first to be

138
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,000
censored years ago censored in 2017 i

139
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,880
was censored when the first book medical

140
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,520
medium came out

141
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,680
2015

142
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,440
i was censored we had a fight our way

143
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,639
through it you have to fight your way

144
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,479
through the darkness right when the

145
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,840
darkness comes and wants to stomp out

146
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:00,320
the light

147
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,639
you gotta fight your way through it to

148
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,400
make sure people heal

149
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,400
right so when the darkness comes and

150
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,560
wants to stomp that light out be like

151
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,720

00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,320
you're not allowed to heal anybody

153
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,639
you're not allowed to break the rules

154
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,840
and teach them why they're sick the true

155
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,919
causes

156
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,520

00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:41,920
vinegar i stayed away from acv

285
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:44,320

291
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,360
crumbling in before you know it before

292
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,440
you know it

293
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,000
diatomaceous earth particles stay away

294
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:04,160
from that bentonite clay stay away from

295
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:07,519
that activated charcoal stay away from

296
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:10,720
the activated charcoal i'll tell you why

297
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:13,600
when you consume the activated charcoal

298
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,680
it suffocates the intestinal lining not

299
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,360
allowing nutrients and enzymes and

300
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,519
everything that needs an amino acids and

301
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:22,640
all these fantastic things it doesn't

302
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:25,279
allow anything to come through very

303
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,800
rarely can it come through so it has to

304
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:30,720
come through in different moments of

305
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:33,279
time you get nutrient deficiency totally

306
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:36,240
nutrient deficiencies

307
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:38,640
big time with activated charcoal right

308
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,240
so keep that in mind right there these

309
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,399
are just a few things i'm just going to

310
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,240
run down a few things okay so what

311
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,760
you're learning with the medical medium

312
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,800
information

313
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,399
is

314
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,399
priceless

315
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:54,000
because your health

316
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:57,600
means everything you can't put a price

317
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:02,160
on your health you cannot put a price

318
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:03,440
it's not measurable your soul

319
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:07,360
you cannot

320
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:10,240
put a price on your soul

321
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:13,120
it cannot happen

322
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,880
your soul is beyond priceless there is

323
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:18,240
no price

324
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,240
we take our soul

325
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:26,320
and it goes and leaves here this planet

326
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:27,839
after we're gone right

327
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:32,800
and there's no way there's no way to

328
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:33,920
measure that value of a human soul right

329
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,560
so that's

330
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:39,839
and that soul sits inside our physical

331
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:41,680
body our physical health is critical

332
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,440
it's precious

333
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,200
all these things matter so when we're

334
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,959
talking about getting our health back

335
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,240
and our lives back and you guys just

336
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,360
came on here we're talking about brain

337
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,240
fog we're talking about headaches and

338
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:55,040
migraines protocols and supplements

339
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:57,040
eczema talk about vertigo protocols and

340
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,880

00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:01,839
your health matters

342
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:04,880
so taking the wrong things like they all

343
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:06,800
throw at us okay your bentonite clay

344
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,399
rips your intestinal tract apart

345
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:11,519
destroys your lining in your intestinal

346
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:13,120
tract you don't do clays

347
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,200
remember that

348
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,279
okay so very important to know all of

349
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:20,000
this so let's move on a little bit so i

350
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:21,360
just want to kind of kind of cover that

351
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,040
area

352
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,480
right

00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:27,040
and

354
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,839

00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:19,839
in this book in the protocols so if you

377
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:22,079
go to eczema you go to brain fog you go

378
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:23,279
to an area inside this book you'll

379
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:26,079
notice

380
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:30,320
almost all of the recommendations of

381
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:34,240
supplements in there are mostly singles

382
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:37,440
singles say you take a lemon balm what

383
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:41,199
does it say it says lemon balm

384
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:44,639
it's not a blend of 50 herbs it's not a

385
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:47,120
blend of 50 nutrients

386
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:49,199
that's how they take you

387
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:52,880
that's how they take you

388
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:56,000
yeah that's rip off land and that's why

389
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:58,320
people don't get better i mean people

390
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,160
who get sick don't get better people who

391
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,240
are waiting back and forth are not so

392
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:04,240
sick and sick they're just elevating

393
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,000
back and forth and things are keeping

394
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,920
afloat and keeping a float when you go

395
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,519
down and you go really sick and you're

396
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,360
really sick

397
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:12,560
you got to know the protocols and you

398
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,959
have to know

399
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,639
why singles

400
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:19,199
are critical

401
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,199
singles

402
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:23,199
i call this singles for a reason right

403
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:26,000
here so you'll notice that almost every

404
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:29,519
one of the items to come

405
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:32,000
in this section a single herb

406
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:34,720
right what you won't find here are

407
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,279
bottles and bottles of supplements you

408
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:40,320
guys this is so important

409
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:43,040
with dozens and dozens of ingredients

410
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:45,199
herbs dozens of vitamins a dozen amino

411
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:48,079
acids and more you won't find that in

412
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:50,240
the recommended supplements here

413
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:52,480
because you don't get better you don't

414
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:55,199
go to the finish line details matter

415
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,639
details matter details matter

416
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,480
they matter

417
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:02,720
there's a reason for this when you fill

418
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:06,000
a capsule with anywhere from 10 to 40

419
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:08,320
items 10 to 40 nutrients

420
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,240
10 to 40 nutrients of herbs and whatever

421
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,320
else and minerals and amino acids or

422
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:16,320
whatever it's going to be it's only

423
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:19,760
going to contain a spec of each one so

424
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:23,600
it's only going to contain a spec of

425
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,600
each one keep that in mind

426
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:29,360
and that spec won't it won't even be of

427
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:31,040
the quality that you need

428
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,279
this is why

429
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:35,440
junk supplements or supplements that are

430
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:36,880
even of quality of some sort don't get

431
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,839
people better after all these years this

432
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,480
is you guys

433
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:43,759
maybe

434
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:46,720
many of you guys know the history in the

435
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:47,920
last 10 20 30 years in your life you're

436
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,199
seasoned

437
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,720
you've been there you tried all these

438
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,639
piles of supplements you've been to

439
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,160
another lime doctor and tried a bunch

440
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,600
more pile supplements and you went to a

441
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,279
functional medicine doctor and you tried

442
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,639
this and the specialist who tried this

443
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,399
you're taking all the supplements and

444
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:01,839
then a year goes by you're still sick

445
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,600
and they all sit and up in the cat

446
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:05,199
cupboard and then you get a whole bunch

447
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,279
more because you go see another doctor

448
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:09,120
right and all these supplements are

449
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:11,680
saturated with lots and lots and lots of

450
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:14,160
bits and spark pieces of tidbits of

451
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:16,079
nutrients like i said and that's why

452
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,680
people don't get better this is so

453
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:19,759
important if you guys just came on we're

454
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:23,519
about to run into brain fog

455
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:25,759
headaches and migraines eczema vertigo

456
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,759
right

457
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:30,320
this is a practice that the industry

458
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,240
does they put together junk supps and

459
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,079
they put specs and specs and specs and

460
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,000
tidbits in of each little thing that's

461
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:38,000
how they make their money when you do a

462
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,680
spec of an amino acid then a speck of

463
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,600
this is speck of spirulina and then a

464
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,519
speck of this and then a speck of

465
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,360
bladder rack and then a speck of an herb

466
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,880
whatever it is you just spec spec spec

467
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,519
specs back

468
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:52,320
you got a capsule now with a bunch of

469
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:55,279
specks that will never move the needle

470
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:57,440
you can't move the needle with a speck

471
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:59,199
here you are sick for real reasons we're

472
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,959
going to talk about cover and cleanse

473
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:02,480
the heel and you can't move the needle

474
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:03,440
with a speck

475
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,319
this

476
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:09,280
schooling or whatever this learning or

477
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:11,760
this information is so critical here

478
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:13,520
there's a reason why i'm here making

479
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,600
shorts for free making sure i'm not

480
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:17,360
turning this into some kind of course

481
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,839
making sure i'm not making you guys pay

482
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:23,199
for all this information this is

483
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:23,199
precious information

484
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:27,839
so

485
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:30,480
alina says i am migraine free

486
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:32,960
and i had daily migraines for two years

487
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:35,120
nothing helped with medical medium means

488
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,120
alina you were doing the protocols you

489
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,280
were doing you're seeing

490
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:41,520
what works and you're experiencing it

491
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,600
and you're feeling it

492
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:46,880
yeah cindy lou says it's so hard to hear

493
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:48,080
about friends taking junk supplements

494
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,240
right

495
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,919
i wasted so much money

496
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,240
so let's go into it a little bit let's

497
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:56,000
head into an area now let's talk about

498
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,799
brain fog

499
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,919
you can have brain fog

500
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:04,240
and this person can have brain fog

501
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:06,080
and this person can have brain fog

502
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,760
on this other person over here can have

503
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,480
brain fog

504
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:12,240
and everybody can have brain fog

505
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:15,280
but nobody will know

506
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:17,120
why they have brain fog you can guess

507
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,880
everybody can guess you can go to

508
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:21,360
another practitioner another doctor and

509
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,520
we can guess while we have brain fog

510
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:25,520
and we can guess and we can guess and we

511
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:29,120
can guess to the cows come home we can

512
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:31,360
guess until the cows come home

513
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:33,679
but won't know why we have brain fog

514
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:36,799
lots of guesses

515
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:39,679
the true cause of brain fog is low-grade

516
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:42,559
chronic viral infections

517
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:46,400
most commonly caused by one of the over

518
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:48,640
60 varieties of epstein-barr virus

519
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:52,559
and toxic heavy metals such as mercury

520
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:56,000
aluminum and copper or both of viral and

521
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:58,960
a viral load and toxic heavy metals in

522
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,919
combination so viral load and toxic

523
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:04,960
heavy metals in combination right

524
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:07,039
copper toxic heavy metal right there

525
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:09,679
right it's copper

526
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:12,720
big thing of copper right here okay

527
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:13,919
toxic heavy metal in our system

528
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,160
right

529
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:19,039
virus

530
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:22,080
virus inner system

531
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:23,200
virus and metals

532
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,640
makes

533
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,840
brain fog

534
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,799
how

535
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:32,240
because the virus feeds off of metal

536
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:34,240
releases a metal neurotoxin

537
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,880
that neurotoxin

538
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,559
heads up to the brain

539
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,320
enters

540
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:42,799
the brain

541
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,240
lands on neurons and you got the brain

542
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:45,760
fog

543
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,679
let's go into the brain a little bit for

544
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:51,760
a couple of seconds

545
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:53,679
everybody's got metal inside their head

546
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:56,960
everybody does

547
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:58,880
it's ignored by the industries

548
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:02,159
it's frowned upon to even think about

549
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:04,000
how that's even possible

550
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,440
the industries they'd still be well they

551
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,760
still are they're still putting mercury

552
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,919
amalgams in people what am i saying

553
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:12,159
i was wrong just got corrected by spirit

554
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:13,919
of compassion just now

555
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,919
i mean i hate being corrected by

556
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:17,679
spiritual compassion but i have to eat

557
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:21,039
it when i gotta eat it

558
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:22,159
when i've been wrong

559
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:23,919
and

560
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:25,520
what i was thinking for a second was no

561
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,520
they don't put mercury amalgams in

562
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,720
anybody anymore it's been outlawed or

563
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,640
something they don't do it in spirit

564
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:33,039
compassion corrected me and said no

565
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,880
they're doing it still they still put

566
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:37,200
put mercury amalgams in people here in

567
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:40,400
the u.s and around the world i was stand

568
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:43,520
corrected so i have to eat that one

569
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:45,919
but regardless okay

570
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:48,480
there's so much mercury out there that's

571
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:51,039
to be had in many ways

572
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:53,600
it's in the fish you eat every time i

573
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:55,200
hear no i had sushi i'm eating healthy i

574
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,799
had my sushi

575
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,679
i'm eating healthy

576
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:59,200
right

577
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:01,280
having my sushi

578
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,960
okay every time i hear that i just i

579
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,000
just

580
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,919
kind of like

581
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,720
cower a little bit like

582
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:10,080
bone it down like what

583
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,760
really

584
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,360
because you just get more mercury so

585
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,120
when you have your brain fog or you're

586
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:17,840
going to feed your brain fog more and

587
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,840
more and more

588
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,480
our brains get mercury

589
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:25,039
our brains get a lot of toxic heavy

590
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:27,919
metals inside of them okay

591
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:28,840
those metals start to rust and corrode

592
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:32,080
and

593
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:33,360
bleed those metals start to

594
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,039
decay

595
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:38,000
is what they do

596
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:41,520
just like your mercury filling did in

597
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:44,159
your tooth they break up they discharge

598
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:46,240
they decay and the same thing happens

599
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:48,240
with all the metal particles inside of

600
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:50,080
our brain

601
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,880
and those toxic heavy metals once they

602
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:54,400
start coming apart

603
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,600
outgassing

604
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,200
rusting

605
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,679
decaying

606
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:02,960
right popping apart all those different

607
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:04,720
molecules of toxic heavy metals

608
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,520
they start to age

609
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:09,919
and then it spreads to adjacent tissue

610
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:11,919
and neurons and then your electrical

611
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:13,520
field starts hitting more and more metal

612
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:15,039
and more and more places and now you've

613
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,799
got the brain fog and the brain fog's

614
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:18,720
bad and the brain fog is worse and the

615
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:20,000
brain fogs back and that's what happens

616
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,559
right there

617
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,520
and we get in trouble

618
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:25,919
then

619
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,679
if you got a viral issue too you've got

620
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:29,200
a viral issue got the shingles

621
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:32,159
epstein-barr

622
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,760
hhv-6 set of megalovirs all the viruses

623
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,360
that everybody walks around with the

624
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,200
viruses

625
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,880
the real virus is the ones that have

626
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,520
been keeping everybody chronically ill

627
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:44,159
the ones that trigger up

628
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:46,000
when they get a bad flu or the plague

629
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:47,679
and then boom they triggered up i don't

630
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,280
know why i got the hearing problems now

631
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:51,120
after the plague normally i have the

632
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:53,120
tinnitus and the vertigo after playing

633
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:55,440
that those are viral issues that's

634
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:57,520
reactivated shingles reactivated

635
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,280
epstein-barr reactivate viruses when you

636
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,960
have the viruses

637
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,559
you don't even need the plague you got

638
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,400
the viruses

639
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:06,400
right the viruses are feeding off those

640
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,480
metals inside the body

641
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,080
then they release neurotoxins and then

642
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,840
we're even worse off with a brain fog

643
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,600
you could have the worst brain fog your

644
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,679
brain fog could get so bad you don't

645
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,760
even know who you are sometimes that's

646
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:19,440
how bad brain fog can get it could get

647
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,200
really crazy

648
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,559
so i'm in the brain fog section now i

649
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,240
covered a little bit about the cause of

650
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:26,640
brain fog something that

651
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,240
you can't hear from a doctor something

652
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,400
something that you can't hear from a

653
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,559
practitioner unless they use medical

654
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,799
medium info or they mutated medical

655
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:36,640
medium info and added their own

656
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:38,480
blend of something in there

657
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,640
right so what's in here we got a fresh

658
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:43,440
celery juice work up to 32 ounces every

659
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:46,799
morning if that's all you can do

660
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,799
just the fresh celery juice

661
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:51,919
about you

662
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:53,520
i never shame anybody i never shame

663
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:55,440
anybody

664
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:58,880
when it comes down to healing i know

665
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:00,880
it's not easy we take one step at a time

666
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:03,039
i'm not here

667
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,480
to make things harder than they already

668
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:06,400
are for so many sick people and

669
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,600
chronically ill people

670
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,279
i'm not

671
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,400
i mean you can just get celery juice

672
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:12,320
down i'm fine but you know what's gonna

673
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:15,440
happen though right

674
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:16,559
yeah that medical medium guy

675
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,720
he's telling everybody they could be

676
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:20,720
cured one shot would sell a glass of

677
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,080
celery juice and they're cured medical

678
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,600
medium is going to be clear every

679
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,960
medical medium

680
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,799
give it out a glass of celery juice

681
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,559
everybody's cured one shot that's what

682
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:30,640
they're saying let's write a let's write

683
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:34,159
another media

684
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:36,640
another media slander story

685
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:38,320
right you guys know how it rolls it

686
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,320
moves the needle for many people when

687
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:42,400
you first take a few sips

688
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:44,320
right but it's also a powerful healing

689
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,760
tool coupled with a lot of medical

690
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:49,520
medium tools

691
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:52,000
combined with other medical medium tools

692
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:54,320
to move the needle in some serious

693
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,919
chronic illness brain fog or anything

694
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:58,720
like that

695
00:24:55,919 --> 00:25:00,320
yeah i've seen people down celery juice

696
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,960
for a week and boom their brain fog

697
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:04,720
lifts i've also seen them need way more

698
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,640
than that

699
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,159
way more than this this is fresh celery

700
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,440
juice so you might be somebody that

701
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:10,880
needs a little bit more than celery

702
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,240
juice so here you go here's cleanse the

703
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:15,360
heel a minute

704
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:17,840
and now it says celery force right by

705
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:20,159
the way i took some before i came on

706
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:22,080
and it's kicking in it's kicking in

707
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:24,799
right celery force that's the vimergy

708
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:26,799
celery force says that in there

709
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:29,200
i took four capsules before coming on to

710
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:30,760
this live just now

711
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:34,799
so then there's

712
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:38,440
5mthf right so i see 5mthf

713
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:41,760
in here so it says one capsule daily of

714
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:43,520
5mthf right the methylfolate one capsule

715
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:47,039
daily

716
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:49,679
actually says one capsule twice a day

717
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:51,600
ashwagandha

718
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:55,200
says ashwagandha

719
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:58,400
right here one dropper full twice a day

720
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:01,039
for brain fog ashwagandha so i'm doing

721
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,559
one dropper full right there

722
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:04,320
in the shot glass

723
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:05,679
so what i like to do is i like to put up

724
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,600
in the shot glass and i like to put a

725
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:09,679
little bit of water and then then i'm

726
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:13,760
good okay

727
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:16,720
so we got that barley grass juice powder

728
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:18,400
the barley grass cheese powder

729
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,320
the supplements i use for my friends and

730
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,360
family and for me that i recommend

731
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,960
anything

732
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:25,440
anytime a friend contacts me and says

733
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,279
what do i take for this

734
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,400
i'll be like make sure it's it's it you

735
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:30,880
get that and they're like well what

736
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,960
brand i'm like vimorji i'm not sponsored

737
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,480
by these guys but the stuff is that good

738
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,080
right that's the barley grass juice

739
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,200
powder

740
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,520
right

741
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:42,400
it says cat's claw here it's interesting

742
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:43,919
so it says cat's claw okay

743
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,000
so

744
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:49,039
there's a cat's glove

745
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,880
now why would we need cats claw for

746
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:53,120
brain fog

747
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:56,080
because someone might have a really

748
00:26:53,120 --> 00:27:00,000
difficult case of brain fog where it's

749
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:02,720
viral for sure not just metals maybe

750
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,480
it's a lot of viral going on maybe they

751
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,760
got the epstein barr and they got the

752
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,679
shingles and they got some other ones

753
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,760
and they're creating a lot of poison in

754
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:12,000
their system and you want to do some

755
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:14,640
viral killing

756
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,760
some epstein-barr killing you want to do

757
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:19,360

758
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:21,760
you got the cat's cost so it's in the

759
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:23,200

761
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:28,960
so what does it say for a dosage it says

762
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:30,880
one drop or full twice a day

763
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,799
one dropper full twice a day so let's

lemon balm

767
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:41,039
lemon balm is anti-viral

768
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:43,919

769
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:46,159

770
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:49,039
really soothing on the central nervous

771
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:50,559
system incredible for panic attacks

772
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:51,840
anytime i've had a family member a

773
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:54,240
friend or anything say they have some

774
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:55,760

775
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,760
i talk to a doctor that wants advice

776
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:59,600

778
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:04,799
lemon bomb for panic attacks you can you

779
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:07,679
can do a lot of lemon balm

780
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:11,039
so important so important one dropper

781
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:12,320
full twice a day it says for brain fog

782
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:14,399
so i'm going to put a dropper full of

783
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:17,039
lemon balm in there

784
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:18,399
if you guys don't mind right

785
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:21,520
see that

786
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:23,039
got a drop on the book

787
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,960
so let's see what else we got going on

788
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:26,640
the chaga mushroom

789
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,960
we you know beverage has a chaga

790
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:32,480

the limit licorice root

792
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:37,279
so why would we use licorice root for

793
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:38,240
brain fog

794
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:41,440
why

795
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:44,159
antiviral licorice root is anti

796
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:46,240
epstein-barr the very thing behind one

797
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:48,480
of the very things next to metals is the

798
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:50,880
epson bar right the very thing behind

799
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:53,200
brain fog so you see licorice roots here

800
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:55,760
one dropper full

801
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,760
that in there

802
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:02,720

spirit of compassion wants a metal leaf

804
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:07,039
in here one dropper full twice a day of

805
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:09,279
the nettle leaf so you got the metal

806
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:10,799

you can be somebody that just does a

810
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:23,600

1118
00:39:54,720 --> 00:40:00,880
protocol for eczema and let's go into

1119
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:02,960
the true causes of eczema right now

1120
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:04,480
let's go into that a little bit

1121
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,359
so i'm going to move the book over a

1122
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:08,359
touch

1123
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:08,359
okay

1124
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,720
somehow

1125
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:19,359
some way

1126
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:22,960
in somebody's life

1127
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:25,440
something moved into the liver

1128
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:26,640
something what is it what moved into

1129
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:29,520
their liver

1130
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:32,960
somewhere maybe they drank

1131
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:34,480
water that went through copper pipes

1132
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,319
maybe

1133
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,599
they had

1134
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:40,319
copper

1135
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:43,280
from some other water contamination in a

1136
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:44,240
restaurant when they got their coffee

1137
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:47,920
maybe

1138
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:50,160
their family members had ddt already

1139
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:51,760
inside of them which is high in copper

1140
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:54,240
ddt

1141
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:55,920
and that ddt passed down from generation

1142
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:57,359
to generation

1143
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:00,079
maybe

1144
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:02,000
someone had pharmaceuticals

1145
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:03,920
that were high in copper because all

1146
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:07,839
pharmaceuticals are high in toxic heavy

1147
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:11,359
metals and somehow that copper found its

1148
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:12,640
way inside their liver

1149
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:14,880
right

1150
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:17,599
and then that copper sat there it was

1151
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:18,480
fine that that copper sat there that was

1152
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:20,960
okay

1153
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:23,440
so right if the copper sat there right

1154
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:24,720
let the copper sit in somebody's liver

1155
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:27,359
that's fine

1156
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:28,800
that's fine but then one day

1157
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:30,240
one day

1158
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,839
that person

1159
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,839
whoever that is

1160
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:35,920
ended up

1161
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:37,920
contracting an epstein-barr virus

1162
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:40,880
the epstein barr

1163
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:42,240
and maybe that epstein barr was passed

1164
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,000
down

1165
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:47,200
from their parents generation to

1166
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:49,119
generation in the womb as a child

1167
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:51,760
maybe the epstein barr

1168
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:55,200
was passed around in college

1169
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:57,680
maybe it was that first person that you

1170
00:41:55,200 --> 00:42:00,560
know someone became intimate with and

1171
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:03,280
that partner in life or anybody and that

1172
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:06,079
was passed along maybe they drank out of

1173
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:07,920
a glass at a restaurant an epstein-barr

1174
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:10,400
was on that glass stuck in somebody's

1175
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:12,079
lipstick or stuck in some guy's saliva

1176
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:14,319
that wasn't washed off the glass good

1177
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:16,400
enough at the restaurant

1178
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:18,240
maybe they'd have seen bar was on a

1179
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,599
toilet seat somewhere

1180
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:21,200
and someone's

1181
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:23,760
put their butt right down on the toilet

1182
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:25,920
seat and picked up that epstein bar

1183
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:28,560
and found its way inside of them

1184
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:30,400
but they got the epstein-barr virus an

1185
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:31,520
epstein-barr

1186
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,839
has

1187
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:35,599
a really good relationship with copper

1188
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:37,520
the copper was in the liver and the

1189
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:40,800
epstein bar is now in the liver and that

1190
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:42,079
epstein bar feeds off of copper inside

1191
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,359
the liver

1192
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:45,440
you see

1193
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:47,440
and as that epson bar is eating all that

1194
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:49,680
copper particles that were trapped

1195
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:53,200
inside that liver and somebody that i've

1196
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:55,920
seen bar got so full and so fat and

1197
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:57,200
happy and so stuffed as if it was

1198
00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:00,079
thanksgiving

1199
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:01,920
that the epstein bar burped

1200
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:04,560
and pooped

1201
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:06,400
out that copper

1202
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:08,720
and that copper poop

1203
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:12,240
in that copper burp

1204
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:13,359
outgassed a copper neurotoxin but that's

1205
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:16,000
okay

1206
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:18,079
that copper neurotoxin sat inside the

1207
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,240
liver for the first six months of that

1208
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:23,440
person's time with all this and then

1209
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:24,960
that copper neurotoxin that the virus

1210
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,640
pooped out

1211
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:28,560
and excreted out

1212
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:30,319
stayed inside the liver for longer and

1213
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,119
longer and then that liver finally got

1214
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:34,800
so

1215
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:37,800
tired of holding on to all that copper

1216
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,800
dermatoxin

1217
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:43,200
that it puffed out of the liver

1218
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:44,960
and that copper dermatoxin puffed and

1219
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:48,240
puffed out of the liver and then it

1220
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:50,560
started heading to the outer regions of

1221
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:53,119
the skin in the derma

1222
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:55,839
and that person got their eczema and

1223
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:58,079
their psoriasis

1224
00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:59,920
and that's the cause of eczema psoriasis

1225
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:01,760
story time i thought i would do a story

1226
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:03,440
time on the cause of eczema and

1227
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:06,160
psoriasis

1228
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:08,079
so what do we do about it fine

1229
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:10,960
fine

1230
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:13,040
someone might say you convinced me

1231
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:16,800
what do we do about it we got to get one

1232
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:18,720
or two one or the other out of the liver

1233
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:21,119
we got to get the virus out of liver the

1234
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:24,160
epstein-barr virus or we have to get the

1235
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:26,800
copper out which one would you like

1236
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:28,079
which one do you want to get out i don't

1237
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:30,079
care which one

1238
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:31,599
you want to get out the viral issue get

1239
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:33,359
out the virus you want to get out the

1240
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:35,520
copper and get out the copper because in

1241
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:38,480
this book cleanse the heel you can do

1242
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:40,560
the heavy metal detox cleanse

1243
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:43,040
you can do the heavy metal detox

1244
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:46,400
smoothie you can have like you know the

1245
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:47,760
vimergy spirulina or demergy barley

1246
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:49,520
grass

1247
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:51,440
and that's what you put in the heavy

1248
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:53,200
metal detox smoothie you can have the

1249
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:55,280
dolls right

1250
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:58,160
there's the dolls liquid

1251
00:44:55,280 --> 00:45:01,280
okay you can put that in there

1252
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:02,880
but you can get the copper out

1253
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:05,040
there's a way to get it out and when you

1254
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:06,560
get the copper out if that's the route

1255
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:08,400
you want to go you want to go with

1256
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:10,960

and if you want to go the route of

1260
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:19,280
getting the epstein bar out you can do

1261
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:21,200
that too then you go with the anti

1262
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:23,359
epstein-barr

1263
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:24,880
anti-epstein bar option

1264
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:27,520
and you can get

1265
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:30,000
the viral issue out

1266
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:31,200
of your liver

1267
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,280
so that's

1268
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:35,680
eczema okay

1269
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:38,079
one or more of the 60 varieties of fcmr

1270
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:40,880
virus living inside the liver feeding

1271
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:43,680
on an abundance of the toxic heavy metal

1272
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:46,000
copper releasing a copper-infused

1273
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:48,880
dermatoxin that circulates throughout

1274
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:51,839
the body and can't detoxify properly due

1275
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:53,680
to a high fat high protein diet whether

1276
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:56,800
it's plant-based or animal-based there's

1277
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:58,160
no there's no uh being biased against

1278
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:00,079
one or the other

1279
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:02,079
you can do a high-protein plant-based

1280
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:03,760
diet a high-fat plant-based

1281
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:05,599
plant-based diet you can do a high-fat

1282
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:07,359
high-protein animal-based diet doesn't

1283
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:09,359
matter

1284
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:11,200
and other food choices that are

1285
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:13,119
unproductive to the condition when these

1286
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:15,119
dermatoxins float to the surface of the

1287
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:17,359
skin they cause the source and rashing

1288
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:18,880
of eczema psoriasis

1289
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:22,800
with vitiligo

1290
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:25,839
it's an aluminum-based dermatoxin it's

1291
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:28,640
an aluminum-based dermatoxin different

1292
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:30,319
pathogen toxin brews are are behind

1293
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:32,720
different varieties of these skin

1294
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:34,480
conditions so that's right there so what

1295
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:36,640
do we do

1296
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:39,599
what do we do about eczema

1297
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:41,359
right so let's go to page 509 where it

1298
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:43,680
is that's where xm is i just lost the

1299
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:45,119
page okay

1300
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:47,520
here we are

1301
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:49,520

i'll say the dosage for 500 milligram

1313
00:47:17,839 --> 00:47:22,400
capsules twice a day if you can only do

1314
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:24,160
one capsule once a day that's where you

1315
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:25,839
start talk to your doctor see what's

1316
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:27,359
right for you maybe you're somebody

1317
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:29,520
that's sensitive you just want to do one

1318
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:32,079
little thing because you've tried so

1319
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:34,160
many bad things and things that were not

1320
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:36,000
good that you just you got burned too

1321
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:39,839
many times and now you're scared you say

1322
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,839
okay well i'll do one thing

1323
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:44,960
and then it says mullin leaf it says

1324
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:48,000
nettle leaf it says spirulina it says

1325
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:52,240
the b12 the zinc the c right

1326
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:53,760
so it shows in here an anti epstein-barr

1327
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:56,720
protocol

1328
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:58,559
but it also shows the spirulina

1329
00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:01,040
right and the barley grass juice powder

1330
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:03,920
because you're doing an anti-copper

1331
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:05,839
based metal protocol

1332
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:07,599
it's like hey someone wants to get

1333
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:10,000
better

1334
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:11,920
there are answers out there there are

1335
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,880
answers out there

1336
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:16,480
is adults tincture better than flakes

1337
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:19,040
you could do either or

1338
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:20,559
either or adults tincture or the flags

1339
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:22,559
like right if you got the flakes use the

1340
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:23,839
flakes so if you got the flakes use the

1341
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:26,000
flakes

1342
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:27,839
right this is just so easy for me

1343
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:30,480
because a lot of times i can't find the

1344
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:33,040
flakes i can't find adults i run out all

1345
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:36,319
the time so this is just this is so easy

1346
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:38,800
for me and what i like about the dulce

1347
00:48:36,319 --> 00:48:41,520
the dulce liquid right is all of it's

1348
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:42,960
there to grab onto the metal and i know

1349
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:45,440
because

1350
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:48,480
all of the chemical compounds are there

1351
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:50,240
to grab onto metal and pull metal out so

1352
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:52,240
i just i just love it

1353
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:54,240
atlantic dolls tincture that's the

amerigy.com

1358
00:49:00,839 --> 00:49:05,520
ray so we're talking about eczema let's

1359
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:07,119
hit vertigo really quick let's look for

1360
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:08,880
vertigo

1361
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:11,839
so i'm going there now

1362
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:13,760
i think it's on 550.

1363
00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:15,920
so a lot of conditions a lot of symptoms

1364
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:18,000
in here so let's try to let's try to get

1365
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:20,800
there we'll find that

1366
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:23,440
here it is so we got vertigo

1367
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:25,760
okay so vertigo is the vagus nerve

1368
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:28,160
everybody needs to know that april taft

1369
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:30,559
says can you explain how eczema heals

1370
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:31,599
does it constantly

1371
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:33,680
how it

1372
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:35,440
here's how it works right the minute you

1373
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:37,520
start cleaning up your liver

1374
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:39,440
you start cleaning that up if that liver

1375
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:42,960
is filled up with a lot of dermatoxin

1376
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:45,040
from the virus or a lot of copper right

1377
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:46,880
it gets sludgy it gets packed in there

1378
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:48,960
so as you're trying to heal your liver

1379
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:51,359
is going to be puffing out a lot of that

1380
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:53,200
old copper a lot of that old dermatox

1381
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:55,280
and a lot of that old viral byproduct

1382
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:57,440
right it's going to be puffing it out so

1383
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:59,520
you you get your healing it's not

1384
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:01,280
unusual to have moments where it's up

1385
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:03,520
and down i always say three steps up two

1386
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:05,440
steps back three sips up two steps back

1387
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:07,599
so you're going up right eventually once

1388
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:10,240
your liver clears up with enough of that

1389
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:12,240
now you're home free it's less and less

1390
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:14,079
less and less less and less and then

1391
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:15,920
it's gone so many people you've seen how

1392
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:17,520
many people got worse got rid of the

1393
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:18,720
worst skin conditions and medical medium

1394
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:20,079
information by the way that's never

1395
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:22,160
happened before in chronic illness

1396
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:24,319
anywhere in history

1397
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:26,000
and that's what's incredible about it

1398
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:27,680
someone might have a more aggressive

1399
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:30,400
viral condition that takes a little bit

1400
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:32,160
more of a makes a little bit more work

1401
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:33,839
well that's why the protocols are here

1402
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:36,720
you can take it as far as you need to go

1403
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:37,599
to keep on getting a more aggressive bug

1404
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:39,760
out

1405
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:40,400
right or if you got a lot of copper in

1406
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:42,000
there

1407
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:44,000
it takes a little time to get the copper

1408
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,200
out but one is going to get one is going

1409
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,960
to give it's going to be either the

1410
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:48,800
viral issue is going to give give and

1411
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:50,720
boom or it's going to be the copper is

1412
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:53,440
going to get and boom and then you're

1413
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:55,359
home free so many people have

1414
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:56,160
riddled with eczema

1415
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:58,640
and

1416
00:50:56,160 --> 00:51:00,800
and just and it's gone right so let's

1417
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:04,559
talk about vertigo a little bit

1418
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:06,079
vertigo is the vagus nerves

1419
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:07,520
the vagus

1420
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:10,079
nerves

1421
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:13,280
that's what vertigo is right

1422
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:14,960
so keep in mind so the vertigo

1423
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:16,400
also when someone has vertigo i mean

1424
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:18,960
they can have tightness of the chest

1425
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:20,960
they can have tightness of the throat

1426
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:22,880
they can feel not just dizzy and have

1427
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:24,880
the balance issues somebody with vertigo

1428
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:28,079
can have even more than that so not just

1429
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:29,520
dizziness and and the balance issues

1430
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:31,520
it's you can have tightness to the chest

1431
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:34,480
you get crippling anxiety when you when

1432
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:36,960
your vagus nerves are inflamed crippling

1433
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:38,960
anxiety panic attacks a lot of people

1434
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:40,880
have panic attack where they're just

1435
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:43,119
panic attacks all the time their heart's

1436
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:44,720
going they're panic attacking everywhere

1437
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:47,520
they're nervous they're scared you know

1438
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:49,280
because they're so ptsd from their panic

1439
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:50,800
attacks that's another thing you get the

1440
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:53,280
post-traumatic stress syndrome from

1441
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:54,720
having so much anxiety right and that's

1442
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:56,640
really difficult for so many and the

1443
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:59,599
vagus nerves are inflamed so when the

1444
00:51:56,640 --> 00:52:01,119
vagus nerves come out of the brain stem

1445
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:02,800
and they come out of that brain stem

1446
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:05,680
right so when the vagus nerves come out

1447
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:07,440
of there okay and there's then now

1448
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:09,040
they're traveling and they're going in a

1449
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:10,800
couple of different directions hitting

1450
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:12,720
every single almost every single nerve

1451
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:15,280
an intestinal tract hitting nerves in

1452
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:17,760
the heart right when those vagus nerves

1453
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:19,920
get inflamed

1454
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:23,280
that's when anything could go wrong with

1455
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:24,880
the vertigo at any moment because the

1456
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:26,720
brain stem

1457
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:29,359
vagus nerves coming out of the brain

1458
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:31,280
stem get inflamed up there by the brain

1459
00:52:29,359 --> 00:52:33,520
stem

1460
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:35,040
and then boom you're in vertigo boom

1461
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:36,640
you're in vertigo

1462
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:38,720
that's where you are

1463
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:40,559
and now you're getting the bed spins the

1464
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:42,000
room's spinning you're getting the spins

1465
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:43,760
you close your eyes and everything's

1466
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,520
moving this way you know and going like

1467
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:47,680
this over and over again where you close

1468
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:49,359
your eyes and then you're literally you

1469
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:51,040
you have to sit so still as you're

1470
00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:53,680
spinning and then you you turn over and

1471
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:56,079
you you vomit on the floor you know so

1472
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:57,680
many people just vomit they can't help

1473
00:52:56,079 --> 00:52:59,359
it they're spinning so much that they

1474
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:01,839
have a bedpan where they vomit in the

1475
00:52:59,359 --> 00:53:03,599
bedpan some people can't walk they're so

1476
00:53:01,839 --> 00:53:05,760
dizzy and it starts hitting them or they

1477
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:07,040
go down where they're walking and all

1478
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:08,880
they're walking along and all of a

1479
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:10,559
sudden they start going down like they

1480
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:12,240
feel like they're going down even though

1481
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:13,760
they're standing upright they feel like

1482
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:15,760
they're going down that's the kind of

1483
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:17,839
vertigo they have

1484
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:19,680
okay so they have all these different

1485
00:53:17,839 --> 00:53:22,800
renditions so many people have this

1486
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:25,359
where the vertigo is just out of control

1487
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:26,839
and what that is is that's the vagus

1488
00:53:25,359 --> 00:53:29,839
nerves being

1489
00:53:26,839 --> 00:53:31,440
inflamed but what are they inflamed with

1490
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:33,280
medical medium information teaches

1491
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:35,839
people why they're inflamed

1492
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:37,839
okay and so when you look at that you're

1493
00:53:35,839 --> 00:53:40,319
like why are they inflamed like what's

1494
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:42,480
going on true cause epstein-barr virus

1495
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:43,920
epstein-barr virus neurotoxins wreak a

1496
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:45,520
lot of havoc

1497
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:48,079
they create fibromyalgia they create

1498
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:51,119
vertigo they create tinnitus there's

1499
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:53,440
over 60 varieties of epsom bar

1500
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:55,440
and different epstein bars do different

1501
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:58,400
things some aggravate

1502
00:53:55,440 --> 00:54:00,400
aggravate aggravate um vagus nerves like

1503
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:03,040
no other virus does

1504
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:06,319
and if you're high in toxic heavy metals

1505
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:08,960
then there's even more chances of having

1506
00:54:06,319 --> 00:54:11,359
a vertigo that sticks around and keeps

1507
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:13,520
the brain stem area and the vagus nerves

1508
00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:15,680
and everything inflamed this is all

1509
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:17,839
original medical medium information

1510
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:20,000
which leads to that whole thing where

1511
00:54:17,839 --> 00:54:21,760
you know everybody takes a nugget they

1512
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,359
go out there somewhere and drop the

1513
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:24,800
nugget off somewhere nobody knows where

1514
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:26,880
it came from and they'll never know how

1515
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:29,280
to really heal

1516
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:30,559
so veneers

1517
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:32,000
is

1518
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:34,640
made up

1519
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:36,000
so we have to know that so meniere's

1520
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:39,119
disease

1521
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:40,799
where you have crystals in your ear

1522
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:43,440
is a theory

1523
00:54:40,799 --> 00:54:44,240
just critical to know

1524
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:46,160
all

1525
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:48,160
vertigo

1526
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:49,680
that's mysterious

1527
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:52,160
because meniere's is

1528
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:53,920
just mysterious because they're just

1529
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:56,319
theorizing saying maybe it's these

1530
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:58,160
crystals in somebody's ear well

1531
00:54:56,319 --> 00:55:00,319
that was

1532
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:02,160
a funny theory when you're 60 years old

1533
00:55:00,319 --> 00:55:05,040
because that's what happened back back

1534
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:06,640
30 years ago back 30 40 40 years ago if

1535
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:09,359
you were 60 years old 50 years old you

1536
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:12,160
got your first bout of vertigo

1537
00:55:09,359 --> 00:55:13,280
because young people didn't get vertigo

1538
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:14,240
by the way

1539
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:16,799
rare

1540
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:19,599
rare a 20 year old a 19 year old a 17

1541
00:55:16,799 --> 00:55:22,960
year old ever got vertigo it was only 60

1542
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:25,040
year olds 70 year olds 80 year olds

1543
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:27,359
50 year olds back 40 years ago it was

1544
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:29,599
only 50 year olds it was rare was ever a

1545
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:32,079
40 year old that got vertigo yeah you'd

1546
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:34,319
get that occasional 30 38 year old or

1547
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:37,280
something a 35 year old but it was rare

1548
00:55:34,319 --> 00:55:39,280
vertigo mysterious vertigo was always

1549
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:41,520
for people that were in their 60s or 70s

1550
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:43,280
or 80s back 40 50 years ago remember

1551
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:45,280
talking to doctors a long time ago

1552
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:47,280
they'd be like oh yeah it's vertigo

1553
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:49,040
cases are people that are in their 70s

1554
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:50,160
you know in my practice another doctor

1555
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:51,520
like people in their 80s and other

1556
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:53,440
people be like yeah i had a few that are

1557
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:56,000
in their 50s but that's years ago right

1558
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:57,920
now you're 20 you're 19 years old you're

1559
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,680
21 years old you're 25 years old and

1560
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:02,240
everybody's got vertigo now so what

1561
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:05,760
happened did the crystals change did the

1562
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:07,040
crystals pick a different age bracket

1563
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:09,040
i'm kind of curious on that because i

1564
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:11,760
scratch my head all the time they always

1565
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:13,280
said when you're 80 years old you got

1566
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:15,440
meniere's that's what your vertigo is

1567
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:17,040
it's crystals in your ear

1568
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:19,760
because you know you've got crystals in

1569
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:21,760
your okay well that it's only for older

1570
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:24,160
people because young people don't have

1571
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:26,400
crystals crystals don't exist in young

1572
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:28,160
people's ears okay i'm scratching my

1573
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:30,319
head on that one because everybody in

1574
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:32,079
their 20s now has vertigo they're all

1575
00:56:30,319 --> 00:56:34,720
getting sick with vertigo and they don't

1576
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:36,480
have crystals so i'm kind of confused

1577
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:38,240
there did the crystals all of a sudden

1578
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:40,160
change their job

1579
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:42,799
because i'd like to know that

1580
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:44,319
did the so-called crystals these this

1581
00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:46,720
theory of crystals from the medical

1582
00:56:44,319 --> 00:56:49,040
establishment did they change their age

1583
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:51,119
bracket of what they're targeting

1584
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:51,839
are they like are they like some kind of

1585
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:54,400
like

1586
00:56:51,839 --> 00:56:56,559
demographic social media demographic

1587
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:58,880
crystals all get together around a round

1588
00:56:56,559 --> 00:57:00,000
table i think to all these crystals get

1589
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:01,280
together

1590
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:04,400
and they're all talking to each other

1591
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:06,160
like hey by the way let's go start uh

1592
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:08,079
causing vertigo in a 20 year old for the

1593
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:09,839
first time in history

1594
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:11,920
no the crystals didn't change their

1595
00:57:09,839 --> 00:57:13,839
demographic they didn't change their age

1596
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:15,680
bracket they didn't change anything the

1597
00:57:13,839 --> 00:57:17,520
crystals weren't the reason why anybody

1598
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:19,760
had vertigo was always viral it's

1599
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:21,839
because the vagus nerves get inflamed

1600
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:23,680
here's the problem people in their 20s

1601
00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:25,359
now are all getting inflamed vagus

1602
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:27,920
nerves people in their 20s people in

1603
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:30,079
their 30s people in their teens are all

1604
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:32,000
getting inflamed vagus nerves and that's

1605
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:33,839
why they end up getting the vertigo it's

1606
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,960
the epstein-barr

1607
00:57:33,839 --> 00:57:37,040
causing

1608
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:38,880
it's the epidemic of the epstein barr

1609
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:40,400
the different varieties the fact that it

1610
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:42,160
went rampant the fact that it's been

1611
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:43,599
passed around over and over again all

1612
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:46,559
around the world the fact that everybody

1613
00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:46,559
has epstein-barr

1614
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:52,079
yeah

1615
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:55,040
chester says this guy is too legit to

1616
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:56,559
quit

1617
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:58,160
i wish i read that better would have

1618
00:57:56,559 --> 00:58:00,640
been cooler

1619
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:02,000
