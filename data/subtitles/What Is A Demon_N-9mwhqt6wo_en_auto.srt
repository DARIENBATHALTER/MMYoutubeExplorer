1
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:06,319
We're back right now talking about

2
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:10,559
angels, demons, and spiritual tools.

3
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:12,800
We're back. Tech problem behind us.

4
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,880
Anyway, what is a demon? We're going to

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:17,279
talk a little bit about that. It's

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,600
interesting. What's your favorite part

7
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:23,439
of the angels demons and spiritual

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,720
tools audio? What is your favorite part?

9
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,320
That's a question I wanted to ask

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,960
people.

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,439
How is it working in your life to have

12
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,719
this

13
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:34,880
information? Is it groundbreaking in

14
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,800
your life? Information, life-changing

15
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:40,840
information. I see a lot of people are

16
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:44,640
having like major profound shifts and

17
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:46,840
realizations which I had to also have

18
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,640
receiving this information from

19
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:53,520
SOC during the whole process. So, I had

20
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,280
to have a lot of realizations myself.

21
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,680
And just so you know, it leads to like a

22
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,680
hundred more

23
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:01,359
questions and I intend on trying to

24
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,680
answer a lot of them as we go along and

25
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:05,760
and we're doing

26
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:08,880
these. But yeah, Uma says, "The whole

27
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,920
book is my favorite part." Wow, that's

28
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,600
that's amazing. Uma, thank you for being

30
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,600
book three times already." You know what

31
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,119
happens when you do that? Just

32
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,880
another wow hits you. It's like, "I

33
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:26,880
didn't remember that." or whoa that's

34
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:29,360

35
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,360

Sick boy says, "My favorite part is that

00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,360
we can vanquish a demon that influenced

52
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:15,680
us in the past."

53
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:17,520
Haha. Yes, you can. And that's how

54
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,640
powerful this is. If you guys don't know

55
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,720

tools. It's on Audible on Amazon. It's

also on

64
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,760
Spotify and Apple. I got a little clip

65
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:42,640
right here that's interesting. Let me

66
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,640
see if I could play

67
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,920
this. I could actually show you instead.

68
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,720
Me and tech do not blend well. I'm just

69
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,400
showing you right

70
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:00,239
here. Laura right there. I liked how you

71
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:04,360
made reference to real people and

72
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:08,519
situations occurring now. Indeed. Yeah.

73
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:11,040
Because because it's it's powerful real

74
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:13,360
information. It applies in our lives.

75
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,920
I'll read a little bit to just a couple

76
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,959
little pieces. talk about how it applies

77
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,400
to our life, our

78
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:23,800
lives. It's amazing how it works. You

79
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:27,400
know, you got the fallen angels. Fallen

80
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:30,239
angels are not

81
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:33,280
outnumbering God's angels, but yet

82
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,280
there's so many demons involved working

83
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,000
for the fallen angels. And not every

84
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,599
demon works for a fallen angel. And

85
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,480
there's so many demons involved that

86
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,720
work for the fallen

87
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:46,400
angels doing their

88
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:48,319
bidding, really tangling things up down

89
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,319
here. Do you know anybody that you think

90
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:51,760
might have some demons behind them? Have

91
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:54,120
you ever met anybody in your life that

92
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,720
you think might have some demons around

93
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:59,040
them? Have you ever met anybody in your

94
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,879
life that might be influenced by demons?

95
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,360
Like you can tell it's there it's

96
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:05,599
there's influence there. Lynn Fouch,

97
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,640
good to see you.

98
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:13,120
Enlightenment part is profound and now

99
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:15,519
knowing the game checkmate. Life is

100
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:18,079
shifting for me. The entire book is

101
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:20,400
golden. Listened three times and going

102
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:23,440
on the fourth. Gratitude. I'm honored.

103
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,840
Lyn Fouch, good to see you, by the way.

104
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,639
It's always great to see you. Molly over

105
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:31,360
there on IG.

106
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:34,320
Wowee. Your demons angels audio is just

107
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:37,759
blowing me away. really has helped me

108
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:42,040
grab very personal issues, grasp very

109
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:44,479
personal issues. Whoa. And you know, I

110
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,840
think this is how demons work. Demons

111
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,600
don't want you to know any of this.

112
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,199
That's how it goes with personal issues,

113
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,400
including relationships. That's a big

114
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,680
deal. That's a really big

115
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:55,680
deal. So, it works like this. Demons

116
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,600
don't want you to really know anything

117
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,759
because that's how the game is played.

118
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,360
So, we just walk around all kind of

119
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,440
stupid down here on planet Earth. That's

120
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,720
how it's supposed to go. So we end up,

121
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,280
you know, running into all kinds of

122
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,919
problems like addiction and so forth and

123
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:13,199
everything else. I mean everything from

124
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:17,639
suicide to addiction to just hardships

125
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:21,080
on on even a basic minute level.

126
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:23,680
Bullying bullying is demonic all on its

127
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:25,520
own. So we're not supposed to know

128
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,639
though that demons play a role in it on

129
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,400
any level because that would be against

130
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:33,160
what demons want because demons want

131
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:36,960
this to be secretive. They want this

132
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:39,199
information to be, you know, unheard,

133
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,440
unknown, so that we just go about our

134
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,440
business. Go about our business. Did you

135
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,120
read the ghost information in it? Or

136
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,759
read, did you hear the ghost information

137
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,280
in

138
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:51,919
there? That's just mind-blowing when I

139
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,600
think about it.

140
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:55,199
Everybody thinks anything paranormal

141
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,520
happening in their house or paranormal

142
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:00,479
happening in some institution or an old

143
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:02,240
school or an old hospital or something a

144
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:03,440
basement in an old hospital and they see

145
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,000
all this stuff happening. They think

146
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,520
it's just all ghosts. It's always about

147
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,000
ghosts. Ghosts.

148
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:14,720
Ghosts. Just a 411. Ghosts don't throw

149
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,520
crap. Usually don't throw crap across a

150
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,680
room, bang all kinds of locker cabinets,

151
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:23,360
and do all kinds of things like that.

152
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:26,560
Ghosts don't do that. Those are demons.

153
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:29,479
Demons do that. Did you get into the

154
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:32,319
whole pushpull demon thing? Did you see

155
00:06:29,479 --> 00:06:34,800
that? How many people like they're

156
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,560
standing on the edge of the cliff? Like

157
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,479
a real cliff. They're standing on the

158
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,479
edge of a real cliff and it's deemed a

159
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:42,319
freak accident. I mean, they weren't

160
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:45,600
even too far off like the edge. They

161
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:48,240
were just like four feet away. And you

162
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,319
know what's crazy is I remember I

163
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,800
remember I saw something years ago, a

164
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:55,520
story

165
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:57,080
of this husband, this wife, they went to

166
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,599
this

167
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:02,319
um went to this beautiful place to

168
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:04,319
overlook some trees and some mountains,

169
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:07,919
some hills and so forth. And they were

170
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:10,160
in an area that people usually sit and

171
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:12,160
they picnic and they have they put out a

172
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,000
blanket and they put out a towel and

173
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,919
they bring a little picnic basket. They

174
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,840
crack open a bottle of wine and bring

175
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:19,680
out a piece of cheese or something, some

176
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,520
bree or something and and they're

177
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,599
enjoying the sight, the sightseeing and

178
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:26,319
all that and they're like 15 feet from

179
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:27,840
the edge of the cliff and all of a

180
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,120
sudden the woman gets up and she's

181
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,759
standing there and she's stretching and

182
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,840
she loses her footing 15 feet and all of

183
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,680
a sudden boom boom boom boom goes off

184
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,000
the cliff, goes all the way down, drops

185
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,759
a 100 feet, hits all kinds of branches,

186
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,520
gets dismembered, just everything

187
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,720
horrible that you could ever think of,

188
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,720
lands on the ground somewhere.

189
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:50,080
It's just it's like the husband didn't

190
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,000
push her off, you know, and you know,

191
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,919
it's it's crazy how that works is like

192
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,599
how did that happen? Freak accident.

193
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:57,520
What? A freak accident? Is that what it

194
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:59,280
is? I love when things are passed off as

195
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,360
freak accidents, too. It's really

196
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,599
empowering when you know information so

197
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,440
you can see more. And angels, demons,

198
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:07,280
and spiritual tools is an eye openener,

199
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,879
but it's like a real eye openener. So,

200
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,280
you're not blind, so you can actually

201
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,960
see what's going on.

202
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,319
I noticed this when you study this

203
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,759
information when you hear it and you

204
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,000
hear it more than one time. You just

205
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:22,000
keep on listening to it and you listen

206
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,639
to it whenever you can, right? It's like

207
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,479
it's like everything just starts really

208
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,599
opening up. You see things entirely

209
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:30,639
different. You see the world entirely

210
00:08:28,599 --> 00:08:32,640
different when you're on the road and

211
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,000
you're driving. When you're on the road

212
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,760
and you're driving and there's somebody

213
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,680
really pissed off and angry and they

214
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:41,680
just they're like a road rager, you

215
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:43,200
know, and they're beeping behind you or

216
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,360
something like that or driving around

217
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,519
you and cutting you off or something,

218
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,040
you know, now like why they have they're

219
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,120
demonically possessed in some way or

220
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:53,279
influenced. They have they're a road

221
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,640
road rage, right? That's the kind of

222
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:56,080
situation where people get out of their

223
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,600
cars and they go and they kill somebody

224
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,040
else. they get out and they have a tire

225
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,240
iron in their hand or a gun or something

226
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,320
like that and they go and they shoot and

227
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,000
they kill somebody else on the road or

228
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,440
something. You know, when you see like

229
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,959
there's stuff like that happens every

230
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,680
day out there. Like it's something that

231
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:13,360
happens every single day, this road rage

232
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:14,800
thing. And then there's a lot of

233
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,040
innocent people that are involved with

234
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,720
the road rage thing. But you wonder how

235
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,600
it even gets to that degree. You wonder

236
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,720
how it gets to that

237
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:24,240
point. How did it even get to that

238
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,680
point? Just cuz somebody woke up on the

239
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,959
wrong side of the bed.

240
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:30,480
Boom. They woke up one morning, they're

241
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:31,839
cranky, they woke up on the wrong side

242
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:36,080
of the bed and something's just wrong

243
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:37,839
and now now this happens. But what you

244
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,080
notice when you learn this information

245
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,519
about how demons work. you it starts to

246
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,519
open up and you start seeing so many

247
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:46,120
things like how did how did that woman

248
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:48,720
fall off that cliff down 100

249
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:51,839
ft and land down there and just get

250
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:54,480
chewed up and boom just fell and got

251
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:56,240
ripped apart going down. You had hitting

252
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,600
branches and all kinds of things like

253
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,760
why would that happen? They were just

254
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,040
picnicking. Everything was fine. It

255
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,120
wasn't somebody that was feeble. they

256
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:06,399
actually were

257
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:08,640
strong and they just go off the cliff

258
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:11,519
and I just I just you know there's

259
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,880
another story too this one happened

260
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,480
recently I mean you could probably find

261
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,920
this one somewhere in the media friend

262
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,760
was telling me about this one said he

263
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:21,440
saw the story out there as like a guy

264
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:23,920
who just dove off a cliff in Hawaii

265
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,760
because people it's a famous spot you'll

266
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,920
probably know know more information

267
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,600
about this than me cuz I don't have the

268
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,560
details about the famous spot and

269
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,000
everything like that in Hawaii a a guy

270
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,839
that actually knows how to swim and

271
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,160
knows how to dive. Guy dives down in

272
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:41,000
there, boom, never never surfaces, just

273
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:43,600
gets washed away.

274
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,040
And you know, you wonder how a lot of

275
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,560
these things, first of all, like what

276
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:50,160
made him go and want to dive like that

277
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:52,000
anyway? Like what pushes people to do

278
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,680
dangerous things like bungee jumping?

279
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,720
What pushes somebody to bungee jump? Is

280
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,399
just because they want to prove

281
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,000
themselves and prove themselves that

282
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,440
they don't fear anything? And that's a

283
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,560
whole another thing. It's like the

284
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:04,560
challenge of fear. I don't fear this.

285
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,240
I'm going to jump out of that plane. I'm

286
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,000
going to get my license to fly a plane

287
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,120
and then, you know, and send all my

288
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,600
friends jumping out of it with

289
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,880
parachutes. I don't fear anything. I'm

290
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,320
going to go parachuting and have a

291
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,160
trainer treat teach me how to parachute

292
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:19,279
so I could jump out of planes. I'm going

293
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,959
to face my fears. Face my fears. Why

294
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:23,399
isn't this parachute opening? How come

295
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:27,399
it's not opening? Oh

296
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:27,399
[ __ ] Splat.

297
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:33,360
But basically the bottom line is this

298
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,320
all these things are hap but this stuff

299
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,640
happens every day. This isn't this one

300
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:40,720
thing. This isn't just one thing, you

301
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,519
know, it's one thing. It's like cave

302
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,720
divers. Okay. The whole thing with cave

303
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:45,839
divers. Now how many people go into

304
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,920
caves and they're diving and they're

305
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,600
going down, but they know they know

306
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:52,880
they're supposed to go back after a

307
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,800
third of their tank has been depleted. A

308
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,959
third of their tank has to be depleted.

309
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,480
Like it's depleted for them to go back.

310
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,160
But what happens is there's some kind of

311
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,000
adrenaline surge that happens like an

312
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,480
adrenaline high. But who's propelling

313
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,639
that adrenaline

314
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:09,360
high? The guy knows he's conscious. He

315
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:12,560
knows that he has to turn back after a

316
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:15,279
third of the tank has been depleted. 33%

317
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:17,120
of the tank is down. But he's down there

318
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:20,399
in a cave that's, you know, as narrow as

319
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:22,079
like 2 feet wide, 2 and 1/2 ft wide. And

320
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,600
he's down in this cave. Then he keeps on

321
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,360
going further and further because he's

322
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,120
trying to explore a new part of the cave

323
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,120
that hasn't been documented yet. And he

324
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,360
wants a big plaque, you know, with his

325
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,279
name on it. And then he ends up

326
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,839
obviously dying down there and he has a

327
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:38,079
plaque with his name on it somewhere

328
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,920
else. But the point is is like it's

329
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:43,000
amazing how it works. Like who what's

330
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:45,760
driving the guy? The guy looks at his

331
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
tank tank meter and he sees he's down a

332
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,600
third of a tank. Am I boring you guys

333
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,760
with this information? I'm talking about

334
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,720
angels, demons, and spiritual tools. You

335
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:56,560
got to listen to this original audio

336
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:59,279
audio. You can go to Spotify. You can go

337
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:01,200
to Amazon, Amazon Audible. Type in

338
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,519
medical medium, angels, demons, and

339
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,040
spiritual

340
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:06,480
tools. So, you got a guy, he's he's cave

341
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,240
diving. He's been down there for two

342
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,320
hours. He's got a third of his tank is

343
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:14,000
down. He's in some He's in some narrow

344
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:16,160
cave. He's 300 feet down. He knows if he

345
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,600
keeps on going, he's going to get in

346
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,760
trouble, but he can't help it. So, he

347
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,760
keeps on going. Why can't he help it?

348
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,360
What's telling him to keep on going?

349
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,320
What in his consciousness is telling him

350
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,160
to keep on swimming? Do you

351
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:29,680
know? Basically, he doesn't want to die.

352
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,000
The guy doesn't want to die, but he

353
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,040
keeps on

354
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,279
swimming. And then he's down in that

355
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:38,240
cave and he realizes, "Oh, oh [ __ ] I

356
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:40,000
went too far. Now I'm so far in, I can't

357
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,160
make it on the way back. So, what I need

358
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,600
to do is go find an air pocket. So, I'm

359
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,959
going to keep on swimming until I can

360
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,240
get to this certain part of the cave

361
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:49,920
that I heard of folklore in this cave

362
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,519
back 20 years ago. There was a guy in

363
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,040
here and he said he found an air pocket.

364
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,720
So, now the guy's trying to find an air

365
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:57,000
pocket. The air pocket never shows up.

366
00:13:54,720 --> 00:14:00,240
He runs out of his his

367
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,560
oxygen. But what drove him to do that?

368
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,560
You know, it's another thing, too. And

369
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:08,000
it's the same thing like what drives

370
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:10,880
people to jump off of a bridge with a a

371
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:14,480
cord attached to their leg, their ankle

372
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:16,120
going for like a fun ride. Is it fun or

373
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:19,320
is it demons

374
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:21,600
like trying to get the best of

375
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:23,120
someone? I mean, I'm in a different area

376
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,560
now that what I'm talking about with

377
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,880
this angels, demons, and spiritual

378
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,480
tools. I'm kind of in a different area.

379
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:31,120
There's there's all kinds of stuff to

380
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:33,199
talk about, but um I'm in an area though

381
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,440
that's really interesting. But then it

382
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:37,839
but then it kind of goes along the freak

383
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:40,399
accident area too, like with it, the

384
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:42,399
freak accident thing, you know, and

385
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,000
that's a whole another thing all in its

386
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:46,000
own. So, back to what I was saying is

387
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,880
you got all these angels, all right? You

388
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,160
got God's angels, they haven't

389
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:52,560
fallen. God's angels that haven't

390
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,320
fallen. And then you got these angels

391
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,680
that have fallen. And then you got

392
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,800
angels that are falling. They're

393
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:00,560
falling. They're playing both sides.

394
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,160
They seem to think they're doing the

395
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,639
best for themselves. They think they're

396
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,079
doing the best. The mission is right.

397
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:08,240
Isn't it interesting? You know anybody

398
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:09,600
out there like in the world like humans

399
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,920
that do stuff like that? They're sitting

400
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,360
on the fence or playing both sides. You

401
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:15,279
ever find that out? Do you ever see that

402
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:18,720
out there? Are there humans that you've

403
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:21,040
met in in your day or met in your time

404
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,279
here on planet Earth? Do you ever met

405
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:27,040
any humans? They're they play both

406
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:28,959
sides, right? They're like loyal here a

407
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,639
little bit for this, but not really that

408
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:32,639
loyal. Then they're loyal here for a

409
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,399
little of this. They play both sides and

410
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,000
they think they got the game down,

411
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,680
right? Meanwhile, who are they fooling?

412
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,600
Like something like that. But what

413
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:43,279
happens is these falling

414
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:45,519
angels, they think they're doing what's

415
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:47,360
right. They think they got God's back a

416
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,040
little bit enough. They think they're

417
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:52,000
smarter than God. A little bit smarter

418
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,680
than God. The falling angels, I'm not

419
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,279
saying fallen falling. the falling

420
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,279
angels, they're a little smarter than

421
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:58,639
God. They feel like they also feel like

422
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:01,000
they're kind of like smarter than the

423
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:04,000
fallen angels that have already

424
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,120
fallen and they're they're in between.

425
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,160
They think they're smart. They think

426
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,360
they got it down. So that's the falling

427
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:11,240
angel. They're in the process of

428
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,639
falling. So that's interesting

429
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:16,000
information that came from

430
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:17,680
SOC. If you guys just got on here, I'm

431
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,759
talking about angels, demons, and

432
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,839
spiritual tools. Just go to Amazon, type

433
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:24,279
in Medical Medium Angels, Demons, and

434
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:25,800
Spiritual Tools,

435
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:29,720
Spotify,

436
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:32,600
Apple. You won't be disappointed, you

437
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:34,560
guys. Right. I

438
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:36,240
mean, I'm just going to tell you right

439
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,680
now, it works like this with me. When

440
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,839
I'm talking to SOC and getting this

441
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,440
information, I'm getting mind blown. I'm

442
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,279
not just like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah." I'm

443
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,639
just like,

444
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:47,920
"What? What? Oh my god." Like,

445
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:49,839
"What? I didn't know. What do you mean

446
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,839
there's no grim reaper? But it's a there

447
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:53,440
is kind of like a grim reaper, but

448
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:55,519
there's no grim reaper. Did you get to

449
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,160
that part? It's angel of soul life. Did

450
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,160
you get to that

451
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:04,880
part when I heard that I was just like

452
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:06,760
blown away. Blown away. I I don't even

453
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:10,079
know what to

454
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:13,600
say. Is that Rachel over there? I mean,

455
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:15,280
no. Real Chelsea Field. Hey, real

456
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,760
Chelsea Field. Chelsea, what are you

457
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:20,319
doing? Dear, dear, dear uh friend of

458
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:23,039
mine, beloved friend of mine, the best

459
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:26,480
audio book ever. Explanation points.

460
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:27,919
Thank you for all that amazing info. I

461
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,080
haven't talked to you in a little bit. I

462
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:31,400
I I'm so excited that you're listening

463
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,799
to it.

464
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:36,840
Wow. Thanks,

465
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:39,200
Charles. So, yeah.

466
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:41,200
Um I mean, the thing is with this

467
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,039
information, too, is it's really dense.

468
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,919
I'm just going to say it again. I have

469
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:48,320
to because you think you may may have

470
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:51,280
digested all of it or or taken it all

471
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:53,440
in, but it takes time. I mean, I know

472
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,919
because I can listen to it again and be

473
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,440
like, "What? That's right." And I

474
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:00,840
recorded it like I did the

475
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:04,559
recording. Did the

476
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:07,520
recording for Hay House my P Kate over

477
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:10,080
there. gave me the most compassion and

478
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:13,480
forgiveness I've ever been able to reach

479
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:16,559
for myself because I was doing a lot of

480
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:19,360
self-lame. I've been rebirthed. This

481
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:20,880
explains the insane injurous events. And

482
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:24,559
what happens here is here's how here's

483
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:26,120
what demons want right here. Demons want

484
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:29,919
[ __ ] to

485
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:32,520
happen. Just excuse my French. So sorry.

486
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:34,960
Demons want things to

487
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:36,000
happen and then we blame ourselves.

488
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,679
That's just how it works. Blame

489
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,919
ourselves. Oh, I wish I did this. I wish

490
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:41,760
I did that. Why didn't I do this? Why

491
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:43,919
didn't I do that? What was wrong with

492
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:46,720
me? I'm such a crappy person. I'm a bad

493
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:48,720
person. I'm a terrible person. Wait a

494
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,160
minute. This happened to me. Why? I must

495
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,919
deserve the punishment. I must be

496
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,559
deserving of it. I must be deserving of

497
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:55,919
all these things that happen. And we're

498
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:57,360
not taught how to protect ourselves from

499
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:59,360
demons. We're not taught about how to

500
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,880
protect ourselves. And interesting, you

501
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,400
know, you hear, okay, you got the film

502
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,559
industry, they talk about demons, but

503
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,919
it's all just [ __ ] right? Because

504
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:07,520
it's the film industry and it's just

505
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:08,760
scary movies and obviously it's not

506
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:13,520
real. So, it's all

507
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:15,799
[ __ ] And then you got demons in the

508
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:19,120
um in our civilization

509
00:19:15,799 --> 00:19:21,039
language on this planet, human

510
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,880
civilization. You have demons in the and

511
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:26,320
they're just intertwined into the

512
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:28,559
wording like, "Oh, man, you're demonic.

513
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:30,559
Yeah, you're being demonic. You know,

514
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:32,000
wow, that person's demons are like out

515
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:33,840
of control, right? You hear things like

516
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,600
stuff like that. But people in the end,

517
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:38,720
I mean, what do they really know or

518
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:41,039
feel? But when you actually hear this

519
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:43,280
information and know how it works and

520
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:45,360
what it's about, like what is a demon?

521
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:48,280
And then you learn all that information,

522
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:51,240
it's just like it's like it's a whole

523
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:53,640
another whole another

524
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:58,160
level. Really

525
00:19:53,640 --> 00:20:00,080
is. Aiona says, "Will us killing demons

526
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,240
make a difference in the spiritual war?"

527
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:04,679
I believe

528
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:06,840
so. I believe so. I

529
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:09,440
do. I

530
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:11,039
do. I think what's happening is so out

531
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:14,039
of control now. And you can see it out

532
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:16,320
there. It's so out of

533
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:18,160
control. I I mean, not a lot of people

534
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:20,080
care about people these days. It doesn't

535
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:22,640
work like the world has changed. People

536
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:24,320
really don't give a crap about people.

537
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,559
People can watch somebody dying in the

538
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:28,240
street and they'll just walk by. And

539
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:30,400
there's a reason for that in a lot of

540
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,679
ways. I mean, you know, also people are

541
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,440
scared like I'm not going to get

542
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:35,440
involved or something. You hear that?

543
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,919
But there's that's just a like what I'm

544
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,760
saying is that's just like one example

545
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:42,679
extreme example. People don't really

546
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:45,600
care about people much in the world

547
00:20:42,679 --> 00:20:47,520
anymore. I think a lot of people are

548
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,120
there just people are very selfish these

549
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,840
days out in the world too. It's a lot of

550
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:54,000
self it's it's a big deal. Awareness

551
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:56,559
alone and not giving into demons is

552
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,880
going to make a difference. Awareness

553
00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:00,559
about this information alone and not

554
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,880
giving into demons makes a huge

555
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:07,039
difference. Huge difference. That alone

556
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:08,559
can change this world. That alone can

557
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:10,159
change this world. And that's what this

558
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:12,640
information is. It's life-changing

559
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:14,080
information. It's not just for fun. It's

560
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,679
not for fun. This is life-changing

561
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:19,000
information. World changing

562
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:21,960
information. like

563
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:25,200
worldchanging

564
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:25,200
information, you

565
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:30,919
know.

566
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:34,400
Yeah. Kid Jordan over there on

567
00:21:30,919 --> 00:21:37,080
YouTube. Bully is demonic because I've

568
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:40,559
been bullied all of my

569
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:43,240
life. I'm just kind. You know what's

570
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:47,720
interesting, Kit? Is like uh I've been

571
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:50,600
bullied. I have. I've been bullied. And

572
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:53,559
um you know

573
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:55,480
bullying it's demonic for

574
00:21:53,559 --> 00:21:59,120
sure.

575
00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:01,039
Bullyers either influenced by demons.

576
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:03,200
They can also be a bad person. That's a

577
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:06,880
whole another thing too. A person can be

578
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:09,039
just a shitty person, a bad person. A

579
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,760
person can be just that and still have

580
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:13,480
demons too.

581
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:16,240
Both. A person could be a really bad

582
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:17,679
person. No compassion. just terrible

583
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,120
person, only gives a crap about

584
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:22,080
themselves, you name it, everything

585
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:25,159
around it. And then have demons too on

586
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:29,039
top of it. You can have a

587
00:22:25,159 --> 00:22:29,039
coldhearted, demented,

588
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:35,840
despicable, devious

589
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:37,760
person. And that's that's who they are.

590
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,200
That's who they are. I know in the new

591
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,120
age out there, it's just like, you know,

592
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,640
you'll hear like, "No, everybody's good.

593
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,640
Everybody's got good in them." How many

594
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,720
times have I heard that? You still hear

595
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:49,280
that out there. Everybody's got good in

596
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:51,480
them. Everybody's a good person. Really?

597
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:53,760
Not everybody's a good

598
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,840
person. Where do you think the demons

599
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,120
came

600
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:58,640
from? Where do you think they came from?

601
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,400
And that's the information you find in

602
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:04,400
angels, demons, and spiritual tools in

603
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:08,159
here. What is a demon? A demon was a

604
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:11,280
human. A demon is a human soul. That's

605
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:13,919
what a demon is. How did you become a

606
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:15,919
demon as a human soul? You became a

607
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:18,640
demon as a human soul because you were

608
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:20,960
one bad bad human. You don't believe

609
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,840
there's bad humans here and you don't

610
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:25,440
believe there's bad human souls

611
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:29,640
here and you see it every day. Death,

612
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:32,320
destruction, war, hate,

613
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:34,000
crime. I mean, you see it. You see, you

614
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:36,240
don't think there's bad people. Sure,

615
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,400
there's people that there's people that

616
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,240
try to change their ways. They make big

617
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,840
mistakes. Of course, they fight for it

618
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:45,200
and they try to change their ways. They

619
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:46,559
try to restore who their soul is. They

620
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,080
do everything they can. And they can

621
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:49,679
they can crawl out of it. But there's

622
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,760
people that don't they don't want to

623
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:54,080
crawl out of it. They're not they're not

624
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,679
looking to crawl out of it. They're not

625
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:58,000
looking to better themselves and and

626
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:59,600
heal their soul and repair their soul.

627
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,679
They're not looking to that. They're

628
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,679
looking just to wreak havoc. Wreak

629
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:06,760
havoc. Wreak havoc. Still wreak havoc.

630
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:09,600
There's people out there that do

631
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:11,600
that and it's dark and yeah, they become

632
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:13,320
a demon. If you listen to the audio,

633
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,600
you'll you'll see how they become a

634
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:18,640
demon. Wondering wishing over there on

635
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:22,080
YouTube says, "The audio book is a lot

636
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:26,320
of new true info. A lot for me to take

637
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:29,760
in. I take a few days off just to let it

638
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:31,520
sink in. And now on my second time

639
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,640
listening, it's incredible. Thank you,

640
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:36,799
SOC." and

641
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:38,880
AW. You know, I I play very little role

642
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:40,720
in this unfortunately because, you know,

643
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,960
I have the the privilege and the honor

644
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:45,760
to listen to SOC and I bite my lip

645
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:47,440
saying that because, you know, SOC's has

646
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:52,240
been a pain in my butt since I was four

647
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:54,640
years old. But but I do have the ability

648
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:57,360
I do have the ability to be mature about

649
00:24:54,640 --> 00:25:00,640
it and be like I do, you know,

650
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:02,320
appreciate SOC to such an extent and it

651
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:05,600
is a privilege and an honor to have this

652
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:07,120
information from SOC and and so yeah,

653
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:10,600
it's life-changing and it's it's

654
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,600
incredible information.

655
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:19,720
Okay, so um Betsy over there on IG says,

656
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:22,880
"Literally amazed at this original

657
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:25,679
material, making everything make more

658
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:27,360
sense. Clarity on so many levels." And

659
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:29,720
that's okay, that's an interesting

660
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:32,400
comment. Thank you, Betsy. Clarity

661
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:34,520
matters. And what this does is it

662
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,520
creates this clarity. It provides us

663
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:41,400
clarity.

664
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:43,600
Honestly, like just I see things even

665
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:46,720
differently by having to do because

666
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:50,240
usually I'm I'm I'm deep I'm steeping

667
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:52,520
deep in the medical deep in the medical

668
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,960
save lives. Deep in the medical

669
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:56,640
information true true reasons why

670
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,720
someone's chronically sick. True

671
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,240
reasons. Not all the biohack crap and

672
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,159
the eat better books that have happened

673
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,960
all these decades. Not that stuff like

674
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:07,679
true reasons getting people out of

675
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:10,080
sickness and poor health and chronic

676
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:12,640
illness and getting them to heal and

677
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:14,640
bring them back rising out of the ashes.

678
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:17,760
That's what I've been buried buried

679
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:21,039
buried deep in right up to my neck right

680
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:22,720
in that for so long. And you know always

681
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:24,000
talking to spirit of compassion about

682
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,919
different things spiritually happening

683
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,120
in the world about Mars, planet Mars and

684
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:32,000
so forth and all kinds of stuff. And but

685
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:35,039
when when I really really worked on this

686
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,760
original audio with SOC, I I I was just

687
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:40,240
like eyes are open wider now. Now

688
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:41,360
they're open wider now. Spirit of

689
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,880
compassion, you always told me about

690
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,240
demons. You already told me about that.

691
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,320
Yes. You told me they're real. You told

692
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:49,200
me why. All these things. But man, when

693
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:52,640
you crack into it and you get this

694
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:56,279
information, then you're just like bing.

695
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:59,360
My eyes are like open. They're

696
00:26:56,279 --> 00:27:02,679
open, you know? And they were open to a

697
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:05,000
degree before, but now

698
00:27:02,679 --> 00:27:08,080
like Yeah.

699
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Yeah. Seriously. Over there in IG

700
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:13,120
Marisol over there 144. Great number.

701
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,880
144. That is a number. You know how

702
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:17,120
people are like 11-11? What time is it?

703
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,640
11-11. You know, they they got these

704
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:21,520
numbers and stuff. That number doesn't

705
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:24,880
even touch 144. You look for that

706
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:27,600
number. 144. I lived with a narcissist

707
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:31,960
and really wished I had this knowledge

708
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:33,559
then. Wow. I understand. I understand.

709
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:38,000
However,

710
00:27:33,559 --> 00:27:40,760
repeating I'm on to you would have been

711
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,360
part of my everyday

712
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:45,720
vocabulary. Message received. Message

713
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:48,000
received. And thank you for leaving that

714
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:50,640
comment. It matters to me. You know,

00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,120
your lives matter to me. your health,

716
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,960
your mental state, all of it matters.

717
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,600
This information

718
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:59,600
um is

719
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:02,559
to offer you something. It's to offer

720
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:06,080
you something that really really makes a

721
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:07,200
difference, really matters. And I know

722
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,720
there's going to be a few people that

723
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,760
are like, "Demons, I don't want to hear

724
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:16,480
about that. It's just it's scary." Or,

725
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:18,279
you know, it's but someday someday you

726
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,960
might want to listen to this.

727
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:22,960
someday. It's not scary to be empowered

728
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:25,520
empowered and have the information to

729
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,960
help help you in your life. You don't

730
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:29,440
want to be blind. You don't want to be

731
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:31,840
blind and not be able to see in front of

732
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,840
you. You don't want that. You don't

733
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:35,760
because you might meet somebody and and

734
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:38,080
this information is powerful because you

735
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:39,679
can weed out demons. You can help. You

736
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:41,200
meet somebody and they got demons and

737
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:42,320
you don't know it, but you're not sure.

738
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,840
And then they're being they're playing

739
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,279
with you, but yet you think it's all

740
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,159
good. They're playing with you. You

741
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:47,279
think it's all good. They're playing

742
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:49,120
with you. You think it's all good. And

743
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:51,120
then finally you're just you got bit.

744
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:53,120
You got bit too much. You got bit on the

745
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:55,919
hand too many times. You're like what

746
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:57,520
the hell just happened? I got that was a

747
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:59,159
freaking roller coaster ride. What the

748
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:03,120
hell is

749
00:28:59,159 --> 00:29:05,120
that? I talked about in the um in

750
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:07,960
Angels, Demons, and Spiritual Tools. I

751
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:11,039
talked about the roller coaster,

752
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:15,520
right? And I talked about the the

753
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:17,840
so-called ghost that was in the uh on

754
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:19,440
the ride. Right. The ghost that was

755
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:22,760
spotted and on the ride. Spirit of

756
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:26,559
compassion told me, "No, that was a

757
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:28,880
demon." And so I saw somebody posted

758
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:30,159
that out there. Uh a friend of mine

759
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,520
said, "You got to take a look at this."

760
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:32,799
I was like, "What?" And they that they

761
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,399
showed the roller coaster and everything

762
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:38,559
going by and they showed the demon on

763
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:38,559
the back of the cart. I was just

764
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:44,880
like, "Oh my my god." You know, I

765
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:49,520
think Cable over said, Cable said, "So

766
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:52,679
grateful you're sharing this

767
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:54,640
information, a lifeline in the

768
00:29:52,679 --> 00:29:55,760
darkness." I know that people want to

769
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,120
live in a bubble. They want their

770
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:59,039
blinders on and they want to live in a

771
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,399
bubble. And I get that. And if they got

772
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:02,000
enough resources, they got enough

773
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:04,159
beautiful things in their life, enough

774
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,520
support, they can skate by and skate by

775
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:08,120
like that. But then something's just

776
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:12,000
gonna like something always

777
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:14,080
just an alligator always snaps its jaws

778
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,919
and gets somebody's foot and it just

779
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:19,120
just happens, you know? It's just it's

780
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:21,279
the world we live in. Demons love people

781
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,640
being naive, too. They just love that.

782
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:25,039
They love you not knowing there's

783
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,960
demons. They love not knowing about you.

784
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:29,039
They they love people not thinking

785
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:31,200
demons are behind anything, behind

786
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:32,799
people, behind what people are thinking,

787
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,320
influencing them and so forth. And

788
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:38,640
that's another thing, the free will

789
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:40,399
thing, how it it can alter somebody's

790
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,320
free will. How screwed up is that? When

791
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:45,320
I found that out from um spirit of

792
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:48,480
compassion, that one hit me really hard

793
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:50,880
because free will is that's ours. That's

794
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,880
you. That's yours. No one can touch

795
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:55,919
that. But yet, a demon can influence a

796
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:57,520
person. Kind of like making the like

797
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:59,200
creating a situation where the person

798
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:00,559
changes a choice they're making. They're

799
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,919
using their free will to change a choice

800
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:03,679
they're making that's not that great for

801
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:05,440
them because the demon's influencing

802
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:07,520
them. So now their free will is being

803
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:09,440
altered and shifted. Like how crazy is

804
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:11,120
that? That information is mind-blowing.

805
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:13,679
I don't care what anybody says. Hands

806
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:15,960
down, that just blew my mind open. Soul

807
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:19,440
Light over there on IG says, "I am a

808
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:22,240
therapist and this book brings therapy

809
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:26,039
to a whole new level." Wow. Wow. Wow.

810
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:30,120
That's a compliment. That's a

811
00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:35,559
compliment. Truly is. over there on

812
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:37,960
IG. Okay, let's see. Mm. Family

813
00:31:35,559 --> 00:31:41,840
gratitude. Because of the

814
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:44,960
audio, it takes away the fear and just

815
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:46,399
empowers our lives. You know, I got to

816
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:49,720
tell you something about that. That's

817
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:52,320
incredible because, you know,

818
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:53,760
um fear develops when you're just

819
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,600
getting the crap beat out of you along

820
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:57,440
the way in life, too. You know, it's

821
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:59,360
like that's how it develops, right? You

822
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:01,519
got a hot stove, the stove's on. You're

823
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,960
a little child, you touch the stove,

824
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:06,320
you're burned, and now you're you're

825
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:09,120
afraid of that stove, right? But we we

826
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:11,120
go through life and we get burned in all

827
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,720
these different areas. And that also

828
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:15,000
creates fear because like bad

829
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:18,159
relationship, boom, got burned

830
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,360
there. Um, you know, a bad friend, I

831
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:21,600
listened to this friend, this friend

832
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:23,679
told me to do this, we all got hurt, bad

833
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:25,679
there, right? Like you get burned,

834
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:27,679
burned there. You get burned along the

835
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:29,360
way. You know it happens in this world,

836
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:31,200
right? It just does. You know, you're

837
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,880
walking on a side sidewalk and there's

838
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,880
black ice and you can't see it and it's

839
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,799
20° out and you slip, you crack the back

840
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:38,799
of your head. It's like we get burned,

841
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:41,039
you know, and we go through life and we

842
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:43,679
get we get burned all the time and that

843
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:44,880
creates the fear and sometimes that fear

844
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:46,720
is good because you don't want to touch

845
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:49,360
a hot stove. You don't want to slip on

846
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,880
black ice. You don't.

847
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:53,360
But at the same time, we get a lot of

848
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:55,679
wounds that also get incorporated into

849
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:57,120
the fear when it's other people derived.

850
00:32:55,679 --> 00:33:00,000
It's one thing to be walking down the

851
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:01,679
sidewalk alone and you just don't see it

852
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,960
and you slip on some black ice and you

853
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:04,880
crack the back of your head and you're

854
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:07,120
like, "Son of a gun, that was really

855
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,640
bad." And now you're fearing that and

856
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:11,200
you go outside and you're like, "Whoa,

857
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:12,799
I'm just black ice and me don't we don't

858
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,799
get along and you got to be careful."

859
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:16,799
It's one thing, right? It's another

860
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:17,799
you're walking along with a friend and

861
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:20,240
you know

862
00:33:17,799 --> 00:33:21,840
and something happens, the friend shoves

863
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,279
you and you slip on the black ice and

864
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:25,600
now you got you get into an argument

865
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:27,200
with a friend and you slip on the black

866
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:29,200
ice and you feel like the argument with

867
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,880
the friend most likely involved that

868
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,159
that's how that freak accident happened

869
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,399
and you're like wait a minute and then

870
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:35,679
you start

871
00:33:33,399 --> 00:33:37,760
fearing fearing different things. You

872
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:39,840
start learning and it's it's a whole

873
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:41,440
whole another thing. People have demons.

874
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:44,000
They just do. They have a they have

875
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:46,159

But what's crazy about it is demon isn't

895
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:27,919
even

896
00:34:22,839 --> 00:34:31,159
the real word. That's the second word

897
00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:34,560
that developed through human

898
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:36,159
language where it became demon later.

899
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:38,200
Spirit of compassion told me there was

900
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:40,119
something earlier called

901
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:45,359
derms. So

902
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:47,040
derm derms and so not demons but derms.

903
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:49,040
And that's really powerful because you

904
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:51,919
don't think it's powerful but it is

905
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:55,079
because once you use that term demons

906
00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:59,680
are demons like what how did you know

907
00:34:55,079 --> 00:35:02,240
that? How did you know that? And and it

908
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:04,280
it gives you power. It's like true

909
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:06,960
empowerment when you know their real

910
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:08,560
name. It's It's incredible. So, right

911
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,880
there, you guys see this? I don't know

912
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:12,240
if you can see it right

913
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:13,720
there. Angels, Demons, and Spiritual

914
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:16,320
Tools. That's what it looks

915
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:19,400
like. So, if you get a chance, go to

916
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:21,400
Amazon, Amazon, Audible,

917
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:24,400
right,

918
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:24,400
Spotify,

919
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:31,040
Apple. Think about

920
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:33,680
it. Demons were humans.

921
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:35,920
Demons think they're smarter than

922
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:38,240
anyone. Demons think they're smarter

923
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:39,480
than the people all living their life

924
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:42,640
here on

925
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:44,480
Earth. Demons know that you don't know

926
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,640
that nobody knows their real name, which

927
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,839
is

928
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:49,440
Derms. And then when you get empowered

929
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:51,079
with that information and you have their

930
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:53,960
real name

931
00:35:51,079 --> 00:35:57,760
already, boom, you just pulled out an

932
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:57,760
ace. You just pulled out an

933
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:02,800
ace. Chris over there on YouTube says,

934
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:06,200
"I was scared at first, but after I

935
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:09,200
finished reading, I feel liberated."

936
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:09,200
Incredible.

937
00:36:10,119 --> 00:36:14,880
Incredible. Wendy says, "This audio was

938
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:16,040
such an eyeopener." And that's the whole

939
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,720
point. I

940
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:20,880
mean, you'll see things different, see

941
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:22,880
people differently. Learning this

942
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:28,960
information is beyond empowering. And

943
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:32,599
then you have tools to disempower

944
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:35,160
destrengthen demons. Is dstrengthen a

945
00:36:32,599 --> 00:36:37,680
word? Drengthen

946
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:39,640
demons. You actually have the power to

947
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:42,800
do

948
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:44,000
that. And that's powerful. Elizabeth

949
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:47,880
over there says, "I've listened to the

950
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:49,480
audiobook once and I'm on my second time

951
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:53,480
listening.

952
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:53,480
Great information."

953
00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:01,119
Yes, people are careless out there in

954
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:03,680
the world. Accidents happen every day

955
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:07,760
where people get hurt and injured. Are

956
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:10,720
all accidents purely human error? Or are

957
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:14,040
demonic forces involved in so much of

958
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:17,599
what we think of as bad luck, happen

959
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:20,000
stance, and freak accidents?

960
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:22,400
Demons love when something terrible

961
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:26,160
happens and someone keeps saying to

962
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:29,839
themselves, "If I only did this, if I

963
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:34,079
only did that, why wasn't I this? Why

964
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:37,960
wasn't I that?" Demons want you to take

965
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:41,200
that hit. Demons want you to go into

966
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:44,240
despair. They want you to feel hopeless,

967
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:47,760
to go to a dark place, to think that

968
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:50,839
dark place is where you belong. Demons

969
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:53,760
don't want people to know they could be

970
00:37:50,839 --> 00:37:56,480
involved. They want you to feel like a

971
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:59,760
failure, to think that what happens is

972
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:02,040
your fault because you are an inadequate

973
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:04,320
person, a bad

974
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:05,680
person. And that's what demons want.

975
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,040
They want you thinking you're a bad

976
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:09,200
person, you're inadequate, that it's

977
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:11,280
your fault, the whole bit. Demons want

978
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:13,440
you to take the hit. It's right here.

979
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:15,440
Demons want you to go into despair. They

980
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:17,520
want you to feel hopeless, to go to a

981
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:19,280
dark place, to think that dark place is

982
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:21,440
where you belong. Yeah. And a lot of

983
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:23,280
people feel that way. They do. It's no

984
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,720
joke. A lot of people go into that dark

985
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,560
place, that rabbit hole, and they just

986
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:29,240
feel like, whoa, this is where I need to

987
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:32,400
belong. This is this is who I

988
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:34,160
am. It's terrifying. Demons don't want

989
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,839
people to know they could be involved.

990
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:38,480
Meaning, demons don't want people to

991
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:40,560
know that demons could be involved.

992
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:42,400
They want you to feel like a failure, to

993
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:45,040
think that what happens is your fault

994
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,960
because you are an inadequate person, a

995
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:48,320
bad

996
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:50,160
person. Yeah. I mean, look, accidents

997
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,400
happen and people make mistakes. Doesn't

998
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:53,760
mean you're a bad

999
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:55,520
person. But demons would love you to

1000
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:59,160
believe that every single thing that

1001
00:38:55,520 --> 00:39:01,599
happens, you're just a crappy bad

1002
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:03,599
person. Just that's how it works. And

1003
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:04,800
and you might be saying, "That's not me.

1004
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:06,880
It doesn't." And then two years from

1005
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:09,040
now, you're like, "God, why did that

1006
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:11,200
happen? and I'm such a terrible person.

1007
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:13,440
Now I'm sick with chronic illness and

1008
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:16,079
now or this and this. I must have just

1009
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,240
did this to myself. Demons love that.

1010
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:19,680
They love

1011
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:21,280
that. And somebody may feel like they're

1012
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,960
on top of the world right now. You see

1013
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,240
it every day. I mean, it just happens.

1014
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,520
People feel like they they're young.

1015
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,960
They're indestructible. They think

1016
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:28,800
they're on top of the world. They think

1017
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:30,680
they're so smart because everything's on

1018
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,720
the internet. You can just look up

1019
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:35,040
anything. You know what I mean? There's

1020
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:36,079
every app on the planet. And they just

1021
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,960
think they're so smart. They think

1022
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:40,720
they're, you know, whatever. And then

1023
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:42,480
boom, eight years, you know, from now,

1024
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:44,079
they're like they're they're on some

1025
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:47,119
kind of addiction. They're like on some

1026
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:48,720
kind of drug. They're, you know, using

1027
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:50,240
shrooms every day and they're blowing

1028
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:53,240
their mind out, like whatever. I mean,

1029
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:55,920
I'm just this one example of a billion.

1030
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:59,520
But if demons are there, they're they're

1031
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:02,400
they're ready to really kind of like

1032
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:04,000
steer people in a bad direction and send

1033
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,520
them in a bad direction and everything

1034
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,160
else.

1035
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:09,839
It just happens. A lot of demonic

1036
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:11,760
stuff's happening during spring break,

1037
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:14,400
like this whole spring break thing that

1038
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:16,560
just happened. So many different things

1039
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:18,400
that have happened where people send

1040
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:20,480
their kids out spring break. They just

1041
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:22,640
it's like, "Okay, honey, you'll be fine.

1042
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:25,040
Don't worry. Come back." And something

1043
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:27,040
terrifying happens. It's every day. It's

1044
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:28,640
like there's demons everywhere. You

1045
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:30,320
don't think there's demons happening in

1046
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:31,440
all the parties during spring break?

1047
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:33,440
There's no demons there in those

1048
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:34,880
parties. You know what's crazy is and

1049
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:36,320
people aren't bringing their demons and

1050
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:38,160
demons aren't being involved, but

1051
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:40,240
alcohol and everything else, the amount

1052
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:42,720
amount the amount of demons involved

1053
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:45,760
just in alcohol consumption is a whole

1054
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:48,400
another game all in its own. But that's

1055
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:50,320
the having eyes and being able to see

1056
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:52,640
and not having blinders on and having

1057
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:54,480
this information is like a the next

1058
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:56,000
level. It's the next level. I mean,

1059
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,839
that's what I'm learning from Spirit of

1060
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Compassion just by getting all this

1061
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:04,400
information down. And whoa, it's it's

1062
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,800
something else. It really is. So, if you

1063
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:09,040
get a chance, Angels, Demons, and

1064
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:11,640
Spiritual Tools, if you get a chance,

1065
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:14,960
check it out on Amazon, Audible,

1066
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:17,920
Spotify, Apple, right? And you can find

1067
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:19,839
it. Type in medical medium. There you

1068
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:23,560
go.

1069
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:25,079
Ray over there says, "My

1070
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:27,680
ex-husband,

1071
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:29,160
look." Oh, okay. Okay. Sorry. It's

1072
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:32,640
moving quick. I'm trying to get it back

1073
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:36,079
down. My ex-husband took his life 43

1074
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:40,440
years ago. I was there when he did it.

1075
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:43,920
Oh my god. He was going to shoot me as

1076
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:45,839
well, but all of a sudden, he decided

1077
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:47,319
not to.

1078
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:50,839
He

1079
00:41:47,319 --> 00:41:53,680
said he was the bad one, not

1080
00:41:50,839 --> 00:41:55,400
me. Just know first of all, just first

1081
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:58,359
of all, just reading

1082
00:41:55,400 --> 00:42:02,160
that, you need to know. Um,

1083
00:41:58,359 --> 00:42:04,400
Roxy, just reading that, I I I like have

1084
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:06,560
tremendous respect when just you going

1085
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,240
through that and and staying here. I

1086
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:10,800
mean, that's 43 years ago and you're

1087
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:12,560
still here. You're still here. Something

1088
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:15,839
inside of you. There's something inside

1089
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:17,520
of you that says, "No, I'm going to

1090
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:19,119
fight for it. I'm gonna I'm going to be

1091
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:21,119
a fighter. I'm going to stay here and

1092
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:24,800
I'm going to be a fighter." And that's a

1093
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:28,160
big deal. Um I'm not just reading your

1094
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:31,960
comment and blah blah blah blah. That

1095
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:35,599
right there, that that hits me hard

1096
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:39,400
because having a psychic mind and also

1097
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:43,319
being able to hear a voice um spirit of

1098
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:46,800
compassion and having that

1099
00:42:43,319 --> 00:42:50,359
ability and um and having that ability

1100
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:53,599
to see when I'm reading that

1101
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:56,240
I'm seeing things that I'm not saying.

1102
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:58,280
I'm seeing things. I'm going back to 43

1103
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:01,440
years ago. I'm going back

1104
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:04,560
there. SOC is talking to me. Just know

1105
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,560
that my heart pours out to

1106
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:12,720
you. So you

1107
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:15,680
guys, angels, angels, uh, demons and

1108
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:18,319
spiritual tools, the tech problems we

1109
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:19,680
have is another. I don't have Tik Tok on

1110
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:21,280
right now, just so you know. I won't

1111
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,720
even put Tik Tok on because they'll ban

1112
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:25,440
me for talking about this. Just talking

1113
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:29,520
about demons, they'll ban me. So anyway,

1114
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:31,119
let me uh head over to uh page 68 if you

1115
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:33,920
don't mind. If you don't mind me doing

1116
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:37,720
that. I think it's over here somewhere.

1117
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:41,760
No, no, no. Come on. Come on. Where am I

1118
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:44,160
going? Where am I going? Oh, right here.

1119
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:44,160
Here we

1120
00:43:44,599 --> 00:43:51,040
go. No one understands how many factors

1121
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:53,839
are involved, including free will. And

1122
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:55,240
that's why people then blame God and the

1123
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:58,720
angels for doing

1124
00:43:55,240 --> 00:44:00,560
nothing. They think God has a magic wand

1125
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:04,319
and should be able to fix everything

1126
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:07,359
with one wave of God's wand. Yet God at

1127
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:09,599
the beginning created a set of laws.

1128
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:12,800
These laws surround the existence of

1129
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:16,880
free will. Change one of these laws and

1130
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:18,400
the fabric of free will becomes altered.

1131
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:19,920
All right. So, that's a really powerful

1132
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,560
piece of information all on its own

1133
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:23,079
right there.

1134
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:25,599
Okay.

1135
00:44:23,079 --> 00:44:27,599
Um, and so I want to talk about like

1136
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:30,520
what leads that to, you know, what leads

1137
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:32,920
us there anyway.

1138
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:35,440
Okay.

1139
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:37,000
So, to begin with, there's only so many

1140
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:39,119
of God's

1141
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,680
angels. That's just to begin with

1142
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:44,800
automatically. Then you have a portion

1143
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:46,880
of the angelic realm that fell.

1144
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:50,240
that portion of the angelic realm that

1145
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:52,640
fell. Okay? It's a smaller percentage,

1146
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:54,520
it's still a lot of angels, okay? And

1147
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:57,839
then you have the angels that are

1148
00:44:54,520 --> 00:45:00,240
falling really, they really don't want

1149
00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:01,839
to jump. They don't want to jump to God.

1150
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:03,599
They don't want to jump to somebody in

1151
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:05,520
strife. They don't want to they want to

1152
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:07,839
make the decision really kind of like if

1153
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:10,079
they want to even help. They're in the

1154
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:11,599
process of falling, you know. So there's

1155
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:13,280
a lot of things and a lot of people do

1156
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:15,040
think that God has this magic wand and

1157
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:17,400
this is information that's just just

1158
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:19,760
blew my mind. It just just

1159
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:21,200
does. And so I'm reading here, no one

1160
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:23,200
understands how many factors are

1161
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:25,119
involved, including free will. And

1162
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:28,160
that's interesting. Including free will.

1163
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:30,240
And that's why people then blame God and

1164
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:31,720
the angels for doing nothing. So when

1165
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:34,640
something

1166
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:36,480
happens and why didn't God stop it? Why

1167
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:39,359
didn't God fix this? Why didn't God stop

1168
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:41,440
this? It's the thing I think that also

1169
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:44,640
really breaks Christianity in so many

1170
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:46,480
ways because there's so many people

1171
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:48,160
they're Christians and then something

1172
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:49,839
happens in their life and then they have

1173
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:51,839
to choose their faith. It's like do I

1174
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:53,839
stay a Christian? Do I believe in God?

1175
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:55,520
Because why would this happen to my son,

1176
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:58,560
my daughter? Why would this happen to my

1177
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:59,920
uncle, my aunt? And what happens is that

1178
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:01,520
like if there's a God, why would this

1179
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:03,839
happen? If there's a God, why would God

1180
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:05,599
let that happen to me? Okay, I could see

1181
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:07,839
God letting it happen to somebody else

1182
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:09,920
but not me. So what happens is you know

1183
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:13,359
you you people they go through this

1184
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:16,319
process this this brain screw about God

1185
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:17,760
and about Jesus and about their faith

1186
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:19,040
the religion and it doesn't even have to

1187
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:20,680
be Christianity it could be something

1188
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:22,960
else and they go through this whole

1189
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:24,720
thing it could be another religion could

1190
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:26,960
be another faith okay so just using that

1191
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:29,240
as an example and they go through this

1192
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:30,760
process and they're just like why didn't

1193
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:33,400
God

1194
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:36,880
wave his magic

1195
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:38,880
wand and so they get really upset

1196
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:40,480
And free will has something to do with a

1197
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:42,160
lot of this too. Free will that the

1198
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:43,520
angels have, they have free will and

1199
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:45,200
that's a whole another thing all on its

1200
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:46,720
own. So no one understands how many

1201
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:49,040
factors are involved, including free

1202
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:51,920
will. And that's why people then blame

1203
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:54,480
God and the angels for doing nothing.

1204
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:56,480
They think God has a magic wand and

1205
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:58,359
should be able to fix everything with

1206
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:01,680
one wave of God's

1207
00:46:58,359 --> 00:47:04,960
wand. Yet God at the beginning created a

1208
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:07,040
set of laws. These laws surround the

1209
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:08,560
existence of free will and that's a

1210
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:11,200
problem too because God created all

1211
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:12,720
these laws based around free will and

1212
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:15,359
spirit of compassion was telling me all

1213
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:17,599
about that and it just blew my mind.

1214
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:19,920
Change one of these laws. Do you guys

1215
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:22,000
hear that? Change one of these laws and

1216
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:25,160
the fabric of free will becomes altered.

1217
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:29,040
And that's another thing all on its own.

1218
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:31,960
So you change these laws, free will is

1219
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:35,920
just out the window.

1220
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:35,920
Anyway, you guys, if you get a

1221
00:47:37,079 --> 00:47:41,839
chance, would love for you guys to hear

1222
00:47:42,119 --> 00:47:50,119
this. I'm sitting Okay, so Stephie over

1223

postpartum, struggling so much, been

1225
00:47:53,359 --> 00:48:00,480
avoiding IG because these

1226
00:47:57,079 --> 00:48:01,839
expectations and standards are hard to

1227
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:04,720
match.

1228
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:06,800
I'm so glad I'm on today and caught this

1229
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:08,800

daughter was murdered by her husband 11

1237
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:26,160
years

1238
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:29,280
ago. I don't even know how to take that

1239
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:31,359
in. I I'm like right there. That just so

1240
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:35,000
my daughter was murdered by her husband

1241
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:39,119
11 years ago in front of the

1242
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:42,920
kids. I got her four kids. There has

1243
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:47,280
been major bad energy in the second

1244
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:48,760

1246
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:54,720
24

1247
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:56,240
evil. Wow. Wow.

1248
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:59,280
And that's the thing when it comes down

1249
00:48:56,240 --> 00:49:01,119
to uh demons is there's different

1250
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:03,280
degrees of demons. And that's the thing

1251
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:05,040
too, you guys. When you when you listen

1252
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:07,119
to this audio, it's an original audio.

1253
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:09,599
Type in angels, demons, and spiritual

1254
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:11,200
tools. It's an original audio. And I

1255
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:12,960
talk about the different levels of

1256
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:15,040
demons. It's just they're not all the

1257
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:16,960
same. They're not all equal. Just like

1258
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:18,960
humans are not all the same and their

1259
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:21,359
souls are not all equal as well. And

1260
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:24,640
then depending on how evil a soul really

1261
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:26,880
is. And then and then so meaning a human

1262
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:29,599
soul right human alive and in their

1263
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:32,079
physical form right here on planet earth

1264
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:34,160
and then depending on how evil that

1265
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:36,640
human is like truly evil that human is

1266
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:39,280
and that human then passes on dies and

1267
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:41,559
then their soul I don't if you heard

1268
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:45,359
this right their

1269
00:49:41,559 --> 00:49:46,960
soul basically goes up for grabs I'm

1270
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:48,960
just giving you like the quick quick

1271
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:50,480
rendition real quick rendition not you

1272
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:51,920
know you have to listen to the audio but

1273
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:54,960
their soul basically goes is up for

1274
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:56,960
grabs. And you got you can get more

1275
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:58,440
dangerous demons, ones that are more

1276
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:02,400
evil, ones

1277
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:04,000
that embark in uh fallen angels, and

1278
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:06,400
they're bidding ones that will work for

1279
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,559
fallen angels because they're so dark.

1280
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:13,200
And

1281
00:50:07,559 --> 00:50:15,599
then they just Yeah, they just allow bad

1282
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:16,960
They create bad things to happen. It's

1283
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:18,640
just heartbreaking. I have my heart's

1284
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:20,960
broken.

1285
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:22,720
Kirstson over there on YouTube. It

1286
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:24,599
really helped me forgive my dad that

1287
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:27,760
passed from a drug

1288
00:50:24,599 --> 00:50:30,480
OD. That's a big deal. There's there's I

1289
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:32,599
have I've talked about that too in here.

1290
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:34,800
The drug addiction involved with the

1291
00:50:32,599 --> 00:50:36,800
demons. Elena says the book is

1292
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:38,880
absolutely mind-blowing. Answer to

1293
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:42,480
answers to many questions. Thank you

1294
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:45,880
much so much an Anthony June over there

1295
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:48,240
on Facebook. Wow, amazing information.

1296
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:49,520
Mind-blowing you guys.

1297
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:51,599
I'm going to do another one of these

1298
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:54,400
soon, too. I've seen a lot of great

1299
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:56,800
comments come up. Wonderful. Julie

1300
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:58,400
Tuesday 144, you're always being so

1301
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:00,480
supportive. You're on YouTube. You're

1302
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:02,480
always answering people and being so

1303
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:04,079
great to them. Just know I see it and I

1304
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:06,240
really appreciate it. Learning that

1305
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:08,000
demons were once humans made a huge

1306
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:09,520
difference in how I perceive them. And

1307
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,280
it makes a huge difference how I

1308
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:13,839
perceive them. It's a reminder. Spirit

1309
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:15,920
always told me this that part that

1310
00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:18,160
humans become the demons. And I I just

1311
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:20,160
never talked about it, but because I

1312
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:22,480
wanted all the information to to get in

1313
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:24,000
here to be able to really put the

1314
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:27,040
information out for people so they get

1315
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:29,119
all the pieces. But yeah, Allison over

1316
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:31,440
there on YouTube, I had a demon take

1317
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:32,920
over my husband at the time and tell me

1318
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:36,839
I wanted to

1319
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:39,800
chop he wanted to chop me up into little

1320
00:51:36,839 --> 00:51:42,240
pieces. Oh my god. Dear

1321
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:46,000
Lord. And tell me it wanted to chop me

1322
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:49,119
up in little pieces. Oh my god.

1323
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:50,400
Yeah. And and but we're supposed to all

1324
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:51,760
sweep that under the carpet, right?

1325
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:53,760
We're supposed to just think that's just

1326
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:55,680
crazy people or something like that. And

1327
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:58,559
yeah, somebody could be an evil person

1328
00:51:55,680 --> 00:52:00,640
in dark, like I said, and be a very

1329
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:02,720
cold-hearted person, but demons just

1330
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:04,839
they can really do some serious damage

1331
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:07,760
with all of

1332
00:52:04,839 --> 00:52:09,520
this. A met says, "I have never

1333
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:13,280
understood why demons in the family

1334
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:15,200
attack those who seek peace and harmony.

1335
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:19,319
Now it makes sense and I have doubts

1336
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:22,480
whether my family is too harmful to my

1337
00:52:19,319 --> 00:52:24,800
daughters. I think what happens when you

1338
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:27,680
know your consciousness gets like like

1339
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:29,040
really opened up, you know, you know

1340
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:31,680
when you hear like the whole thing like

1341
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:33,680
get your third eye open and you know and

1342
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:36,400
you meditate and get your consciousness

1343
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:38,559
you know like you know geared up and you

1344
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:40,559
know all the things and and do all the

1345
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:42,880
self-help and all that stuff and that's

1346
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:45,119
all great but I mean it's all great and

1347
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:46,760
all but without the information like

1348
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:49,760
without the

1349
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:51,559
information we're still left stranded

1350
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:53,960
you You know, I I think

1351
00:52:51,559 --> 00:52:58,480
that this is a world

1352
00:52:53,960 --> 00:53:00,079
changer. This is a world changer. And

1353
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:01,880
that's the thing. If you don't have the

1354
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:04,559
knowledge, how are you going to like

1355
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:05,760
know? How are you going to know? Same

1356
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:07,800
thing about if you don't know why you're

1357
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:10,480
really truly

1358
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:11,680
sick. If you tried every biohack, you're

1359
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:14,079
still sick or whatever it is, you're

1360
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:15,760
just not past it. It's a mystery. Like,

1361
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:17,680
until you know why you're sick, you're

1362
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:20,640
not going to heal. You have to know why

1363
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:22,480
and how you can address it. And in this

1364
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:24,640
situation on a spiritual level, this

1365
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:26,319
information, it's like you learn how

1366
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:27,680
this is happening or how something's

1367
00:53:26,319 --> 00:53:30,960
happening out there. You have to have

1368
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:34,960
the knowledge in order to address it and

1369
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:37,000
take it head on and and heal and and

1370
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:41,040
bypass this information

1371
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:43,480
and jump ahead. Be free from it, free

1372
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:45,680
from demons,

1373
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:47,520
germs. That's an empower thing all on

1374
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:50,359
its own. An empowering thing knowing

1375
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:53,359
their true name.

1376
00:53:50,359 --> 00:53:56,400
Derms. Jess Lane. I'm amazed at how

1377
00:53:53,359 --> 00:53:58,520
specific, detailed, and deep it all is.

1378
00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:01,599
You think I let you down,

1379
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:05,119
Jess? Spirit of compassion. Not going to

1380
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:07,599
let you down. Beth Paige, it is helping

1381
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:09,599
with my nailbiting addiction. To think

1382
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:11,599
that they could be taking advantage of

1383
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:13,839
that is helping me stop that habit. And

1384
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:15,760
they can be taking advantage of that.

1385
00:54:13,839 --> 00:54:18,160
There are demons that are of lesser

1386
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:20,480
damage or lesser depths of evil, but

1387
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:22,240
they're still evil and dark. And they

1388
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:24,720
they would love you to bite your nails

1389
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:26,839
off your fingers. They would love you to

1390
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:30,240
bite your nails right off your

1391
00:54:26,839 --> 00:54:33,280
fingers. Anyway, until next time you

1392
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:34,880
guys, and there will be a next time I

1393
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:36,760
will be talking about angels, demons,

1394
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:39,920
and spiritual

1395
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:42,400
tools. Lena W, the book is amazing. Feel

1396
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:44,720
so empowered now to work for God and the

1397
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:46,640
light. Feels like time is slowing down

1398
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:48,960
too. Can concentrate better and feel

1399
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:48,960
more

1400
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:55,119
present. See what happens when you push

1401
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:57,000
away demons and you disempower them and

1402
00:54:55,119 --> 00:55:00,520
you start moving forward. See what

1403
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:03,040
happens. It's powerful.
