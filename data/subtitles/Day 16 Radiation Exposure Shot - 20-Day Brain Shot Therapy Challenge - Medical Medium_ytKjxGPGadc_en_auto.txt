[0.06 - 4.26] of course not
[1.44 - 5.76] no just live our lives do our thing
[4.26 - 9.42] whatever
[5.76 - 11.10] no one gets radiation exposure and no no
[9.42 - 14.28] no that's not true
[11.10 - 17.40] radiation exposure is a big one
[14.28 - 18.90] people are saturated with radiation
[17.40 - 22.86] exposure
[18.90 - 25.92] people are glowing with radiation that's
[22.86 - 27.48] the reality that's the truth but we
[25.92 - 29.28] don't want to believe that or even think
[27.48 - 30.72] it's even possible we don't want to
[29.28 - 33.60] think it's possible to have radiation
[30.72 - 36.42] exposure how's it even possible
[33.60 - 38.28] there's no way when you meet somebody do
[36.42 - 39.12] you go hey how's your radiation exposure
[38.28 - 41.46] today
[39.12 - 44.46] No No One's Gonna Do That
[41.46 - 48.42] but yet yeah there's radiation exposure
[44.46 - 50.28] anyway what is this day 15
[48.42 - 51.78] of the medical medium brain shot therapy
[50.28 - 53.46] cleanse challenge we're doing radiation
[51.78 - 55.98] exposure shot
[53.46 - 58.50] right there this is an important one
[55.98 - 62.34] because so many people
[58.50 - 63.24] are exposed and nothing gets done about
[62.34 - 65.52] it
[63.24 - 69.18] nothing at all gets done about it ever
[65.52 - 70.98] and the radiation accumulates do you
[69.18 - 73.38] think the radiation exposure you get
[70.98 - 76.02] just goes away
[73.38 - 77.94] no it doesn't go away
[76.02 - 82.44] it stays in US
[77.94 - 84.42] it radiates out of us a lifetime we
[82.44 - 86.34] collect radiation
[84.42 - 88.92] why does it matter
[86.34 - 92.82] because it affects our health it's part
[88.92 - 94.68] of the death by a Thousand Cuts here on
[92.82 - 98.52] planet Earth
[94.68 - 100.38] it's one of the death by a Thousand Cuts
[98.52 - 102.06] so I want to read a little bit about it
[100.38 - 106.80] so let's get into it but first of all I
[102.06 - 109.32] just want to say this is day 16.
[106.80 - 111.12] of the medical mean brain shot therapy
[109.32 - 113.64] cleanse challenge I don't know if you
[111.12 - 115.50] caught me there I said 15 earlier day
[113.64 - 118.02] 16.
[115.50 - 120.48] is the radiation exposure shot that we
[118.02 - 122.88] have right here let's get into it and
[120.48 - 125.28] let's talk about radiation if you guys
[122.88 - 127.88] don't mind 237 do you have your brain
[125.28 - 127.88] saver book
[127.92 - 132.60] do you know what page we're on
[130.68 - 134.52] if you don't have the book still hang
[132.60 - 136.26] out let's do it let's talk about
[134.52 - 139.38] radiation
[136.26 - 142.26] if you do have the book Incredible
[139.38 - 145.44] amazing
[142.26 - 148.08] radiation and EMF section but I'm just
[145.44 - 150.78] going to talk about radiation today page
[148.08 - 153.18] 237 if you're worried about EMF
[150.78 - 155.16] Incredible Book to get information about
[153.18 - 160.32] EMF exposure
[155.16 - 163.38] so right there it is friend saver
[160.32 - 166.28] common medical and transportation
[163.38 - 166.28] technology
[166.50 - 169.46] airplane travel
[169.50 - 174.12] people get radiation from airplane
[171.78 - 175.32] travel right but not just airplane
[174.12 - 179.04] travel
[175.32 - 181.20] because they're in an airplane
[179.04 - 184.46] that's one way
[181.20 - 187.74] people get radiation exposure because
[184.46 - 191.58] radiation is in the atmosphere
[187.74 - 195.12] from World War II
[191.58 - 198.36] from when the bomb was dropped
[195.12 - 200.40] froshima Hiroshima the bomb
[198.36 - 202.80] that propelled
[200.40 - 205.80] a massive amount
[202.80 - 208.44] of radiation into our atmosphere it's
[205.80 - 210.66] still there it's still floating around
[208.44 - 213.84] when you fly in a plane
[210.66 - 216.78] and the plane goes up
[213.84 - 219.60] and it's in it's at that altitude
[216.78 - 222.48] it is flying through the radiation
[219.60 - 224.58] and yes we get exposure just from that
[222.48 - 226.62] alone
[224.58 - 228.06] another form of airplane travel we're
[226.62 - 229.38] going to talk about and another form
[228.06 - 230.82] we're going to talk about too but just
[229.38 - 233.40] go through the basics airplane travel
[230.82 - 235.56] x-rays
[233.40 - 237.78] have you had an x-ray in your life when
[235.56 - 240.12] was it you broke your ankle when you
[237.78 - 243.74] were 13 years old
[240.12 - 243.74] that radiation never went away
[244.20 - 250.92] CT computerized tomography scans
[249.14 - 255.32] p-e-t
[250.92 - 257.70] position emission tomography scans
[255.32 - 259.92] fluoroscopy so many people are still
[257.70 - 261.24] getting fluoroscopy
[259.92 - 264.36] MRI
[261.24 - 266.58] magnetic resonance imaging
[264.36 - 269.10] did I just say something stupid
[266.58 - 271.80] I said something really stupid right
[269.10 - 273.42] I must be a total dumbass
[271.80 - 277.38] big time
[273.42 - 279.24] did I just say MRI and radiation I must
[277.38 - 280.68] not know what I'm talking about
[279.24 - 282.06] I'm probably just one of those stupid
[280.68 - 284.46] people in alternative medicine that
[282.06 - 287.28] don't know anything I guess
[284.46 - 289.92] up just screwed up bad
[287.28 - 294.12] I put in the book here
[289.92 - 297.42] MRI magnetic resonance imaging
[294.12 - 300.72] guess I'm that dumb why would I put that
[297.42 - 302.70] in there when that's not radiation what
[300.72 - 305.82] was I thinking
[302.70 - 307.56] a total dumbass
[305.82 - 310.14] but guess what
[307.56 - 311.40] it is radiation there is radiation
[310.14 - 315.84] exposure
[311.40 - 318.96] MRIs you get radiation exposure
[315.84 - 321.42] fact you get radiation exposure
[318.96 - 324.72] with MRIS
[321.42 - 327.84] incredible right yeah
[324.72 - 328.98] brain Savers info is amazing
[327.84 - 331.02] all right
[328.98 - 334.22] food and water supply we get radiation
[331.02 - 334.22] from food and water supply
[335.28 - 341.28] common nuclear exposure current nuclear
[339.12 - 344.46] weapons exposure and current nuclear
[341.28 - 348.06] plant exposure need I say this but
[344.46 - 350.16] nuclear testing is still happening
[348.06 - 354.12] they still
[350.16 - 359.28] test nuclear weapons
[354.12 - 361.44] they still create nuclear weapons
[359.28 - 363.80] the amount of exposure going into the
[361.44 - 366.36] atmosphere and into the
[363.80 - 368.58] environment alone
[366.36 - 371.22] from where they're building nukes is
[368.58 - 373.76] unbelievable Untold as far as how much
[371.22 - 373.76] exposure
[374.40 - 377.58] I'd hate to be one of those guys right
[376.20 - 380.34] that's
[377.58 - 382.74] helping to build one of those bombs and
[380.34 - 385.68] I'm wearing a hazmat suit and I'm
[382.74 - 387.48] walking around with nuclear rods
[385.68 - 389.58] it's like no don't worry don't worry you
[387.48 - 391.98] got your suit on you're safe those guys
[389.58 - 395.54] live about five years and then they just
[391.98 - 395.54] exchange them and put new guys in
[395.64 - 403.58] continual atmospheric Fallout from past
[398.58 - 403.58] nuclear disasters Chernobyl anybody
[403.98 - 411.12] it's still admitting
[406.32 - 414.12] radiation everywhere right
[411.12 - 416.88] Fukushima still emitting radiation every
[414.12 - 418.74] day everywhere
[416.88 - 420.90] every day it's just going into our
[418.74 - 424.46] atmosphere every day but we don't have
[420.90 - 424.46] radiation exposure on any level
[425.34 - 430.86] nuclear test sites
[427.98 - 432.06] all right are we having fun yet I might
[430.86 - 436.20] have to have
[432.06 - 438.24] a little sip here of lemon balm tea
[436.20 - 440.10] but here's the way I do my lemon balm
[438.24 - 441.42] tea now I want to pop a little bit more
[440.10 - 443.76] in here because I kind of need this
[441.42 - 446.16] right now I need a commentative
[443.76 - 447.48] I actually need a cognitive when I'm
[446.16 - 450.18] reading about this and talking about
[447.48 - 452.58] this because there's a part of you that
[450.18 - 455.40] gets so pissed off
[452.58 - 458.22] that this stuff happens in the world
[455.40 - 460.14] and no one has control over it nobody
[458.22 - 462.54] has control over this crap
[460.14 - 463.98] it's actually demented right isn't why
[462.54 - 466.32] would we do this
[463.98 - 467.46] anyway I'm putting some lemon balm
[466.32 - 470.82] that's the
[467.46 - 473.16] imagery lemon balm incredible stuff
[470.82 - 475.38] so if you guys don't mind I'm popping it
[473.16 - 479.16] in there that's my lemon balm tea it's
[475.38 - 481.74] way way more potent this way by far
[479.16 - 484.86] hands down is using the lemon balm
[481.74 - 486.90] instead of using like tea or whatever
[484.86 - 489.66] oh
[486.90 - 490.62] um I just need a commentive for my
[489.66 - 493.68] nerves
[490.62 - 494.76] and you guys know I endorse them Reggie
[493.68 - 496.98] because it's the greatest stuff out
[494.76 - 498.24] there
[496.98 - 499.86] um
[498.24 - 502.40] I just got to get a little in me I'm
[499.86 - 502.40] sorry about that
[503.88 - 507.90] this this actually topic always bothers
[506.70 - 509.28] me you know how there's certain topics
[507.90 - 511.38] that bother people
[509.28 - 513.66] radiation is one that actually bothers
[511.38 - 515.70] me like it just bothers me personally
[513.66 - 517.56] like I feel
[515.70 - 519.24] I feel like
[517.56 - 522.06] I guess you would say just frustrated
[519.24 - 525.96] about it because we're talking about
[522.06 - 528.18] like Untold damage on this planet that's
[525.96 - 530.28] just happening every day and no one's
[528.18 - 531.60] talking about it they talk about like
[530.28 - 533.04] climate change and everything they don't
[531.60 - 535.86] talk about this this should be talk
[533.04 - 538.14] about every minute it's insane
[535.86 - 541.68] Smith and pepper says I made my grandma
[538.14 - 544.56] the trauma shock and lost shot after my
[541.68 - 546.90] grandpa passed away yesterday
[544.56 - 549.84] I'm so sorry to hear that I didn't tell
[546.90 - 553.44] her what it was for after she drank it
[549.84 - 555.18] she took a big sigh and said that was
[553.44 - 557.34] just what I needed
[555.18 - 561.12] Smith and pepper thank you for letting
[557.34 - 564.30] us all know uh truly truly heart pours
[561.12 - 567.30] out to you and your family
[564.30 - 569.48] I think when it comes down to the
[567.30 - 572.64] radiation exposure it's one of the more
[569.48 - 575.04] I don't know it affects me emotionally
[572.64 - 577.02] because I know on a larger scale and
[575.04 - 578.70] spirit of compassion knows on a larger
[577.02 - 580.62] scale of the kind of damage that's
[578.70 - 582.78] hidden away and tucked away
[580.62 - 584.40] so we're brainwashed and conditioned on
[582.78 - 587.58] this planet and we're brainwashed and
[584.40 - 589.32] conditioned to not realize
[587.58 - 590.76] that all the countries that are building
[589.32 - 592.92] nukes
[590.76 - 596.16] that all the plants that have like blown
[592.92 - 598.38] up like Fukushima Chernobyl whatever
[596.16 - 599.34] the bomb that was dropped Hiroshima
[598.38 - 602.58] right
[599.34 - 605.76] all of this is still spreading untold
[602.58 - 607.62] amounts of radiation around the planet
[605.76 - 610.08] and the atmosphere right
[607.62 - 612.54] and then the nuclear testing untold
[610.08 - 615.48] amounts and so
[612.54 - 618.08] why do you think in the U.S alone nobody
[615.48 - 618.08] owns the land
[618.30 - 623.82] eighty percent of the entire United
[620.04 - 627.12] States is off limits to even step on
[623.82 - 629.94] what same thing around the world
[627.12 - 631.26] 80 of all the other countries land you
[629.94 - 632.88] can't step on
[631.26 - 634.86] it doesn't exist where it's not supposed
[632.88 - 636.84] to exist why
[634.86 - 639.06] interesting
[636.84 - 641.46] all right so
[639.06 - 643.80] Let's uh let's roll let's talk about
[641.46 - 645.54] this stuff a little bit examples of
[643.80 - 646.56] radiation exposure so let's head into
[645.54 - 649.56] this area
[646.56 - 651.66] I need a little bit more lemon balm
[649.56 - 653.52] there's some topics that just really get
[651.66 - 655.32] me
[653.52 - 657.80] that's one of them
[655.32 - 657.80] anyway
[657.90 - 661.44] it's the vemergy it's the best stuff out
[660.42 - 663.54] there
[661.44 - 666.06] all right so examples of radiation
[663.54 - 667.98] exposure
[666.06 - 672.38] the obvious sources of radiation
[667.98 - 672.38] exposure are dental exams
[673.52 - 679.02] Jovana Valencia
[676.02 - 679.92] I passed I get passed off too is it
[679.02 - 682.86] pissed off
[679.92 - 685.74] you know what you um I get pissed off to
[682.86 - 689.96] aw right there with you where's my lemon
[685.74 - 689.96] balm tea and Bemidji lemon balm 2.
[691.02 - 695.94] I have to get some in me
[693.42 - 698.04] just Elaine good to see you love Emoji
[695.94 - 701.34] there's a lot to love with with that
[698.04 - 704.10] company it's just unbelievable what they
[701.34 - 706.94] do no one can touch what they do it's
[704.10 - 706.94] just incredible
[707.58 - 711.84] the obvious sources of radiation
[709.20 - 713.40] exposure are dental exams we know that
[711.84 - 717.60] right
[713.40 - 718.98] even digital ones or the panorama you go
[717.60 - 722.46] into the panorama
[718.98 - 723.90] you go in there you bite onto this right
[722.46 - 725.76] it's like they put a little plastic
[723.90 - 729.06] thing on there and you walk up to it
[725.76 - 729.96] right okay I'm standing here oh all
[729.06 - 731.82] right
[729.96 - 734.09] all right all right all right we're
[731.82 - 739.34] gonna clean it out
[734.09 - 743.19] [Music]
[739.34 - 743.19] [Applause]
[746.48 - 751.08] all right put a new wrapper on for the
[749.04 - 753.92] next person put a new plastic wrap on
[751.08 - 753.92] there for the next person
[755.58 - 760.38] that tasted pretty good though
[757.62 - 764.36] oh there's a celery stuff
[760.38 - 764.36] can't turn down a celery stick piece
[764.94 - 769.98] I need to trace mineral salts
[768.00 - 771.54] intuitively
[769.98 - 774.06] because I'm talking about radiation and
[771.54 - 775.74] nuclear waste and all that I needed
[774.06 - 777.30] some Trace mineral salts and I needed a
[775.74 - 778.86] combative which is the Bemidji lemon
[777.30 - 780.78] balm
[778.86 - 782.64] musette says where can I get the Lemon
[780.78 - 785.34] Ball
[782.64 - 788.88] and I do that's the vimergy Lemon Ball
[785.34 - 791.76] these in Victor I Amazon Mary e r g
[788.88 - 793.86] y.com
[791.76 - 795.42] check it out check out the company no
[793.86 - 797.40] one touches their stuff it's not only
[795.42 - 799.08] potent but it's clean but what I mean
[797.40 - 801.42] clean I mean real real real real real
[799.08 - 802.98] pure like no other
[801.42 - 804.48] there's a whole bunch of reasons why I
[802.98 - 806.22] can't go into it right now because I
[804.48 - 808.80] don't have the time I have to just focus
[806.22 - 811.32] on what we're doing with radiation but
[808.80 - 814.32] by far the reason why I support these
[811.32 - 816.72] guys with every fiber in my being and
[814.32 - 819.90] soul is because of what they do and what
[816.72 - 822.78] they've done with their products
[819.90 - 824.82] I mean if I told you like and you you
[822.78 - 827.66] learned about how and why you'd just be
[824.82 - 827.66] like Blown Away
[829.50 - 834.36] all right
[831.78 - 837.96] Trace mineral salts cluster sodium
[834.36 - 840.06] cluster salts for my brain accommodave
[837.96 - 842.66] for my brain and nervous system please
[840.06 - 842.66] thank you
[844.38 - 847.92] the obvious source of radiation exposure
[846.30 - 849.26] from Dental exams I just gave you the
[847.92 - 851.88] demonstration
[849.26 - 854.16] x-rays that's another one too
[851.88 - 857.34] get a chest x-ray yeah
[854.16 - 860.58] of course in other Medical Imaging
[857.34 - 863.06] such as CT scans and even to the lesser
[860.58 - 867.06] degree MRIs which still has radiation
[863.06 - 868.74] I'm not a stupid ass after all it is a
[867.06 - 870.36] radiation exposure I know people will
[868.74 - 873.12] argue about magnetic resonance in
[870.36 - 875.90] imaging uh I'm sorry you but it actually
[873.12 - 878.64] admits radiation
[875.90 - 881.58] sorry to tell you I mean that's what I
[878.64 - 886.20] mean people don't realize this right
[881.58 - 887.94] now what's interesting too is x-rays
[886.20 - 889.38] if you go and you get a chest x-ray
[887.94 - 890.76] somebody stands there they're going to
[889.38 - 894.36] get chest sex right right they put the
[890.76 - 896.34] apron on the apron is not covering all
[894.36 - 898.74] the rest of their body properly the
[896.34 - 901.74] apron is not covering everything the
[898.74 - 904.56] chest x-ray is centered here right but
[901.74 - 906.06] it still spreads out everywhere so it's
[904.56 - 909.68] like when we get a chest x-ray we're
[906.06 - 909.68] getting hit everywhere regardless
[910.74 - 916.38] yeah
[913.26 - 919.74] even CT scans
[916.38 - 922.08] or frequent dental work that exposure
[919.74 - 925.58] can build up and have a more extreme
[922.08 - 925.58] effect over time in our life
[926.16 - 931.14] our brains sustain a milder effect from
[929.16 - 933.48] the everyday radiation we're exposed to
[931.14 - 937.20] from plane flights
[933.48 - 940.14] cell phones and other devices
[937.20 - 942.84] contaminated food and water
[940.14 - 944.94] being near someone who just got an x-ray
[942.84 - 947.64] or other Medical Imaging tests and I
[944.94 - 950.52] just want to go into that a little bit
[947.64 - 953.34] if someone had an x-ray
[950.52 - 955.92] and we're close to them if you go to the
[953.34 - 958.92] doctor's office
[955.92 - 961.92] and three people in the waiting room had
[958.92 - 963.90] recent CT scans and x-rays
[961.92 - 966.54] and MRIS
[963.90 - 968.70] they're radiating
[966.54 - 970.56] so when you're in that room with them
[968.70 - 972.42] you're getting that radiation if you go
[970.56 - 975.18] to the dental office and someone just
[972.42 - 977.28] had the Panorama they just had all the
[975.18 - 979.14] digital x-rays
[977.28 - 981.66] and they're sitting next to you in the
[979.14 - 984.72] dental office and the seat next to you
[981.66 - 988.52] you're actually getting their radiation
[984.72 - 988.52] it's it's incredible how it works
[989.88 - 993.02] I don't usually say that
[993.30 - 999.18] let's hope that doesn't become a habit
[996.96 - 1001.64] I pick up and start doing habits like
[999.18 - 1003.26] that our brain sustain milder effects
[1001.64 - 1006.08] from everyday radiation we're exposed to
[1003.26 - 1008.00] from plane flights cell phones and other
[1006.08 - 1010.40] devices contaminated food and water
[1008.00 - 1013.52] being near someone who just got an x-ray
[1010.40 - 1015.98] or other Medical Imaging tests in the
[1013.52 - 1020.54] continual atmospheric Fallout from past
[1015.98 - 1023.00] nuclear disasters such as Fukushima
[1020.54 - 1025.04] there's also Fallout from current day
[1023.00 - 1030.50] nuclear testing and nuclear weapons
[1025.04 - 1033.34] developing of which were unaware of
[1030.50 - 1033.34] climate climate
[1036.74 - 1040.22] climate nuclear production
[1038.18 - 1041.36] production in everywhere new clip in
[1040.22 - 1043.22] every freaking country nuclear
[1041.36 - 1045.44] production that's what they're doing how
[1043.22 - 1049.90] about that and how much that's causing
[1045.44 - 1049.90] but no people like climate climate
[1050.26 - 1054.92] it's like nothing is what it seems in
[1053.48 - 1056.72] this world
[1054.92 - 1058.64] nothing
[1056.72 - 1060.74] there's also Fallout from current day
[1058.64 - 1062.00] nuclear testing like I said nuclear
[1060.74 - 1065.06] weapons development of which we're
[1062.00 - 1068.66] unaware plus nuclear plants leak in
[1065.06 - 1070.82] acceptable amount of radiation nuclear
[1068.66 - 1073.34] plants leak
[1070.82 - 1076.04] they're allowed to leak
[1073.34 - 1079.46] because they're not fixable
[1076.04 - 1082.10] nuclear plants aren't fixable
[1079.46 - 1083.80] I can't fix them well we're gonna shut
[1082.10 - 1086.84] down that plant and then we're gonna
[1083.80 - 1089.30] re-modify it and redo
[1086.84 - 1091.34] the lead lining that surrounds it we're
[1089.30 - 1093.26] going to redo that plant and you can't
[1091.34 - 1095.06] redo the plant
[1093.26 - 1098.90] you can't
[1095.06 - 1101.72] you can't take it apart and redo it
[1098.90 - 1104.84] so they up the acceptable amount of
[1101.72 - 1108.62] leakage every single decade the the
[1104.84 - 1110.78] stats for acceptable leakage is upped
[1108.62 - 1114.94] so they let more out because you can't
[1110.78 - 1114.94] fix it you just can't go in and fix it
[1116.02 - 1121.18] now you know why I need the membership
[1122.36 - 1125.26] now you know why
[1125.30 - 1131.06] here's the one topic today I needed to
[1127.10 - 1134.24] come out this Lorraine uh coglinio says
[1131.06 - 1136.48] vimergy was very generous and sent me a
[1134.24 - 1138.44] free bottle of lemon balm with my order
[1136.48 - 1141.02] they're very generous their customer
[1138.44 - 1143.30] service is insane
[1141.02 - 1144.92] and they're very generous it's a mom and
[1143.30 - 1146.96] pop that actually cares about the
[1144.92 - 1149.60] chronically ill it's their mission
[1146.96 - 1151.64] that's the difference too
[1149.60 - 1155.06] supplement companies don't mean they
[1151.64 - 1157.52] give a f about anybody
[1155.06 - 1158.96] you guys some women companies don't mean
[1157.52 - 1160.76] they care just because it's a natural
[1158.96 - 1162.50] supplement company out there it doesn't
[1160.76 - 1164.90] mean they care
[1162.50 - 1166.82] Denver G is a mom and pop that actually
[1164.90 - 1168.38] understands chronic illness and they
[1166.82 - 1170.72] understand people's suffering that's
[1168.38 - 1172.28] that's that that's a big thing right
[1170.72 - 1175.40] there Karen Churchill says my favorite
[1172.28 - 1178.00] supplements is vermergy Lemon Ball
[1175.40 - 1178.00] thanks
[1178.58 - 1181.06] laughs
[1182.18 - 1186.02] so I talked about the Fallout the
[1184.16 - 1187.22] acceptable ranges of nuclear waste
[1186.02 - 1191.18] that's leaking out where do you think
[1187.22 - 1192.98] the frog with four eyes comes from
[1191.18 - 1196.40] you don't think there's a frog with four
[1192.98 - 1198.68] eyes out there they find a lot of frogs
[1196.40 - 1201.74] with four eyes
[1198.68 - 1204.62] that's not a joke it's real Jenny Jenn
[1201.74 - 1206.48] says I got an x-ray of my ankle then I
[1204.62 - 1208.82] had to remind them of the protective
[1206.48 - 1211.36] apron they don't automatically cover you
[1208.82 - 1211.36] with it anymore
[1211.58 - 1218.30] Jenny Chen 100 correct
[1215.30 - 1220.82] not only is your experience 100
[1218.30 - 1223.58] validated
[1220.82 - 1226.94] and correct and accurate
[1223.58 - 1230.06] but they don't they don't apron anybody
[1226.94 - 1231.68] really much anymore you have to ask for
[1230.06 - 1235.22] it and even if you ask for it they don't
[1231.68 - 1238.10] apron you enough though x-ray the crap
[1235.22 - 1239.90] out of you and they want apron parts of
[1238.10 - 1244.30] you that they should they should always
[1239.90 - 1244.30] apron the person down but they don't
[1246.62 - 1250.90] where do you think the frog with four
[1248.96 - 1253.70] eyes comes from
[1250.90 - 1257.56] waterways near these plants
[1253.70 - 1257.56] that's definitely not acceptable
[1257.60 - 1262.88] we also inherit radiation
[1260.84 - 1265.04] so if anyone in your bloodline ever got
[1262.88 - 1268.28] an x-ray or visited a sheet store in the
[1265.04 - 1269.96] days when they imaged feet using a
[1268.28 - 1272.30] fluoroscope
[1269.96 - 1274.04] even though hundreds of thousands of
[1272.30 - 1276.50] women's legs were amputated because of
[1274.04 - 1279.32] using that fluoroscope because women
[1276.50 - 1281.12] went to shoe stores a lot more than men
[1279.32 - 1282.44] back in the day women went to shoe
[1281.12 - 1284.90] stores all the time it was actually
[1282.44 - 1288.62] therapy
[1284.90 - 1290.30] back in the 1930s 40s and 50s women went
[1288.62 - 1291.74] to the shoe store some saying this over
[1290.30 - 1294.20] and over again because people don't they
[1291.74 - 1295.70] don't believe this
[1294.20 - 1298.40] but they did
[1295.70 - 1301.22] that was a mat that was a major outing
[1298.40 - 1304.04] women trying on shoes back in the day
[1301.22 - 1305.78] who still was a very big part of the
[1304.04 - 1307.58] world we lived in back then and we
[1305.78 - 1309.14] weren't born but we lived maybe you were
[1307.58 - 1311.12] you were born Right Said people out
[1309.14 - 1314.00] there much older than me or whatever the
[1311.12 - 1318.14] point is 1930s
[1314.00 - 1319.88] and 40s and 50s it was an event that
[1318.14 - 1321.80] occurred constantly you go to the shoe
[1319.88 - 1323.24] store you try on shoes all the time and
[1321.80 - 1325.58] then you might not even buy them and you
[1323.24 - 1327.68] go and you leave but you put your legs
[1325.58 - 1329.30] in the fluoroscope
[1327.68 - 1331.04] I remember when I broke that information
[1329.30 - 1332.60] out quite a while because no one even
[1331.04 - 1334.88] talked about it like it never existed
[1332.60 - 1336.86] before and I released that info back
[1334.88 - 1338.78] into the world about it there are
[1336.86 - 1340.58] hundreds of thousands of women around
[1338.78 - 1342.26] this country alone never mind on the
[1340.58 - 1344.54] planet that had their feet and legs
[1342.26 - 1346.82] amputated off
[1344.54 - 1351.46] in book one I talked about that in depth
[1346.82 - 1351.46] and the revised expanded over here
[1352.70 - 1357.32] we inherit radiation so if anyone in
[1355.82 - 1359.84] your bloodline remember what I said
[1357.32 - 1361.82] bloodline never got an x-ray or visited
[1359.84 - 1363.98] shoe store in the days when the Imaging
[1361.82 - 1366.02] was about Imaging your feet with the
[1363.98 - 1368.96] fluoroscope some radiation likely ended
[1366.02 - 1370.82] up in you radiation
[1368.96 - 1372.86] gets passed on from generation to
[1370.82 - 1374.66] generation just like toxic heavy metals
[1372.86 - 1378.32] and Mercury
[1374.66 - 1380.78] that is MM info how incredible that
[1378.32 - 1384.14] piece of knowledge is it gets passed on
[1380.78 - 1388.04] down radiation
[1384.14 - 1392.78] so what happens is that we're actually
[1388.04 - 1396.28] being born now loaded with radiation
[1392.78 - 1396.28] and people don't realize this
[1397.52 - 1401.78] it takes time and commitment I got a
[1400.04 - 1405.34] comment right on here on what is it
[1401.78 - 1409.10] YouTube Zoe Cox snake oil salesman
[1405.34 - 1411.08] whoa how smart are you Zoe Cox and how
[1409.10 - 1413.48] original are you too
[1411.08 - 1417.02] snake oil salesman
[1413.48 - 1418.82] the irony is if you skinned a snake and
[1417.02 - 1420.86] squeezed out the oil it would probably
[1418.82 - 1424.48] be more medicinal than anything you're
[1420.86 - 1424.48] doing or recommending anyone
[1425.18 - 1429.14] but thank you for the comment I like the
[1427.58 - 1430.64] Charlton comments and the snake oil
[1429.14 - 1433.04] salesman comments those are actually my
[1430.64 - 1436.72] favorite because they're classics
[1433.04 - 1436.72] and they're kind of funny
[1437.36 - 1443.24] it takes time and commitment to an
[1440.18 - 1445.10] anti-radiation protocol namely
[1443.24 - 1448.10] the medical medium
[1445.10 - 1452.38] heavy metal detox smoothie which is also
[1448.10 - 1452.38] a radiation yanker
[1452.60 - 1458.00] isn't it incredible
[1455.18 - 1460.70] so you can say goodbye to it
[1458.00 - 1463.40] that's actually really funny that
[1460.70 - 1465.86] SOC put it in this way I'm reading this
[1463.40 - 1468.08] it takes time a commitment to an
[1465.86 - 1469.58] anti-radiation protocol namely the
[1468.08 - 1471.38] medical medium heavy metal detox
[1469.58 - 1474.98] smoothie which is also a radiation
[1471.38 - 1477.50] yanker to say goodbye to it
[1474.98 - 1479.36] that's it
[1477.50 - 1480.68] these books are so big and there's so
[1479.36 - 1483.14] much information in them and everything
[1480.68 - 1484.46] that I like I forget
[1483.14 - 1487.78] like
[1484.46 - 1487.78] different parts to it and everything
[1490.52 - 1495.44] don't worry
[1492.44 - 1497.66] Zoe Cox or whatever your name was
[1495.44 - 1500.42] you will get sick someday
[1497.66 - 1502.82] and you'll go through the merry-go-round
[1500.42 - 1504.68] and you'll go through all this crap I'm
[1502.82 - 1507.38] gonna hope you don't get sick
[1504.68 - 1508.82] but you go through all this crap and
[1507.38 - 1511.34] then you'll be at the medical medium
[1508.82 - 1513.74] books looking for answers
[1511.34 - 1516.38] yeah I'm sure you won't tell anybody
[1513.74 - 1518.60] about it I'll still be a dirty Secret
[1516.38 - 1520.70] but whatever
[1518.60 - 1523.24] medical exam protective measures so
[1520.70 - 1523.24] check this out
[1523.46 - 1528.56] lead bibs
[1525.56 - 1530.90] provide it for dental X-rays provide a
[1528.56 - 1532.58] facade of Total Protection
[1530.90 - 1535.22] it's not a nice thing for me to say but
[1532.58 - 1538.28] to know my daughter went for an x-ray
[1535.22 - 1540.02] and I told them to apron her they said
[1538.28 - 1542.32] research shows that the apron isn't
[1540.02 - 1542.32] needed
[1543.14 - 1545.32] foreign
[1553.46 - 1557.08] freaking need another one here
[1557.30 - 1561.10] I can't tell you how upset that gets me
[1564.50 - 1567.82] I can't even tell you're upset
[1569.06 - 1574.94] it's just it's just screwed up
[1571.94 - 1574.94] foreign
[1579.14 - 1582.32] I'm the only person in alternative
[1580.94 - 1584.12] medicine and conventional medicine that
[1582.32 - 1585.56] actually gives it crap and and talks
[1584.12 - 1587.00] about the lead bibs and everything I
[1585.56 - 1589.04] know and no one talks about them out
[1587.00 - 1591.74] there oh but I'm the charlatan I'm the
[1589.04 - 1594.32] I'm the snake oil sales
[1591.74 - 1597.08] love holistic health says I had to have
[1594.32 - 1599.24] an x-ray to my entire head for a dental
[1597.08 - 1603.34] implant and three months later my
[1599.24 - 1603.34] reading vision went down the drain
[1607.46 - 1611.18] so I'm saying this right here and I said
[1609.62 - 1613.04] well I feel bad and I said this right
[1611.18 - 1615.14] here lead bibs provide it but it's the
[1613.04 - 1617.24] truth so what am I going to do let bibs
[1615.14 - 1619.40] provided for dental X-rays provide a
[1617.24 - 1622.22] facade of Total Protection they usually
[1619.40 - 1624.80] don't provide enough coverage
[1622.22 - 1626.72] because it's true they don't cover the
[1624.80 - 1628.58] person enough
[1626.72 - 1630.68] I'm not trying to be mean to any
[1628.58 - 1633.38] dentists or anything of the sort we need
[1630.68 - 1636.08] dentists do we need doctors I get it but
[1633.38 - 1638.48] but I don't I'm not trying to be
[1636.08 - 1642.38] purposefully
[1638.48 - 1645.26] mean it's just the truth so I recommend
[1642.38 - 1647.78] asking for additional protection and try
[1645.26 - 1650.68] to get one bib a little higher to
[1647.78 - 1650.68] protect your thyroid
[1651.62 - 1655.22] can I have an extra bid please an extra
[1653.90 - 1657.74] bib
[1655.22 - 1660.02] can I move the bib up higher to my
[1657.74 - 1662.72] thyroid please
[1660.02 - 1665.00] ajana says holistic dentists are no
[1662.72 - 1666.56] better and I agree with you 100 lots of
[1665.00 - 1669.98] trendy traps
[1666.56 - 1673.60] and still too much radiation ajada
[1669.98 - 1673.60] totally totally agree
[1676.04 - 1680.12] aim is true if you're getting an x-ray
[1678.20 - 1683.18] at a medical facility
[1680.12 - 1684.98] whether an x-ray of the chest
[1683.18 - 1687.94] or neck
[1684.98 - 1687.94] or elsewhere
[1688.04 - 1695.48] ask for extra gear for protection is it
[1692.72 - 1697.82] my freaking imagination
[1695.48 - 1698.60] or can you find all the eat better books
[1697.82 - 1699.98] out there because these aren't eat
[1698.60 - 1702.32] better books these are way above all
[1699.98 - 1704.54] that even in the ebayer books all these
[1702.32 - 1706.52] years can you find that who's putting
[1704.54 - 1709.40] that out there and what podcast doctor
[1706.52 - 1711.56] is even talking about that
[1709.40 - 1713.36] oh oh they'll be talking about it
[1711.56 - 1715.04] tomorrow though that's right because the
[1713.36 - 1716.36] books just you know got out there in the
[1715.04 - 1718.10] world and
[1716.36 - 1720.74] and they steal information from the
[1718.10 - 1722.90] lives and whatever in the videos
[1720.74 - 1726.14] and don't cite it
[1722.90 - 1728.90] ask for extra gear for protection beyond
[1726.14 - 1730.88] what they offer normally for other parts
[1728.90 - 1732.80] of your body not just the part of the
[1730.88 - 1736.54] body immediately surrounding the area
[1732.80 - 1739.40] being x-rayed on IG let's see
[1736.54 - 1743.26] Shamrocks and sunflower says you're
[1739.40 - 1743.26] helping me so much explanation points
[1743.36 - 1748.60] and I think there were four exclamation
[1745.34 - 1748.60] points or three
[1748.82 - 1751.88] thank you
[1750.08 - 1753.14] this lemon bomb is starting to calm me
[1751.88 - 1756.02] down a little bit because that's what
[1753.14 - 1757.22] lemon balm is it's common if
[1756.02 - 1760.22] and
[1757.22 - 1763.28] like when you're using something really
[1760.22 - 1765.32] potent and really high quality you can
[1763.28 - 1767.86] always feel it that's what's incredible
[1765.32 - 1767.86] about it
[1768.44 - 1773.54] so many sources of medical exam
[1770.84 - 1777.44] radiation are hard to avoid
[1773.54 - 1780.62] it's part of the process of seeking help
[1777.44 - 1782.24] I'm not telling you to not seek help
[1780.62 - 1784.64] you break your leg you're going to need
[1782.24 - 1786.68] an x-ray
[1784.64 - 1788.66] when people are looking for answers they
[1786.68 - 1790.76] go to the doctor with a complaint and
[1788.66 - 1793.18] the doctor writes a prescription for an
[1790.76 - 1793.18] x-ray
[1793.58 - 1797.48] CAT scan
[1795.44 - 1802.40] or MRI
[1797.48 - 1805.60] MRI does admit does admit a certain
[1802.40 - 1805.60] amount of radiation
[1806.30 - 1811.70] from chess Rex from chest x-rays to
[1809.00 - 1814.82] diagnose lung issues such as bronchitis
[1811.70 - 1817.16] and pneumonia to arm x-rays to diagnose
[1814.82 - 1819.14] broken bones bursitis or whatever in the
[1817.16 - 1822.02] shoulder this is where our current
[1819.14 - 1825.68] medical system is
[1822.02 - 1828.80] and yet rarely if ever in the X-ray and
[1825.68 - 1833.30] scanning world do they ever offer a lead
[1828.80 - 1835.82] Helmet or protective headpiece
[1833.30 - 1837.68] too expensive to order them and buy them
[1835.82 - 1840.38] is the medical industry just doesn't
[1837.68 - 1843.74] have enough money
[1840.38 - 1847.58] the medical industry is too poor
[1843.74 - 1849.32] to actually create and Order up some
[1847.58 - 1853.72] lead helmets
[1849.32 - 1853.72] but no uh they can't afford that
[1856.36 - 1861.68] octop Corp
[1859.46 - 1864.08] hey there you are the apron is loaded
[1861.68 - 1868.16] with radiation as well because they use
[1864.08 - 1871.16] the same one over and over laptop
[1868.16 - 1871.16] incredible
[1871.52 - 1875.42] incredible octop also followed up with
[1874.28 - 1878.14] her other comment shortly after that
[1875.42 - 1878.14] said pink phone
[1879.68 - 1886.88] if the pink phone rings I will answer it
[1881.90 - 1889.10] and talk to that Zoe Cox person
[1886.88 - 1891.32] still better to have an apron that's got
[1889.10 - 1893.72] radiation in it a lead apron that's got
[1891.32 - 1897.22] radiation in it then not having one it's
[1893.72 - 1897.22] still better keep that in mind
[1898.70 - 1903.92] so with the pneumonia and arm x-rays to
[1901.82 - 1906.50] diagnose broken bones this is where our
[1903.92 - 1908.72] current medical system is and yet rarely
[1906.50 - 1910.46] if ever in the X-ray and scanning world
[1908.72 - 1913.40] do they offer a lead Helmet or
[1910.46 - 1917.72] protective headpiece no so our brains
[1913.40 - 1920.18] are left exposed purposely I believe is
[1917.72 - 1921.68] it wrong for me to think purposely or do
[1920.18 - 1923.30] you think I think with all the signs of
[1921.68 - 1925.70] research and all the brainiacs and
[1923.30 - 1927.98] Geniuses and scientists that we have
[1925.70 - 1930.62] that come out of elite elite Schools
[1927.98 - 1933.14] they're so smart do you think they just
[1930.62 - 1934.94] somehow forgot no they wouldn't have
[1933.14 - 1936.50] forgot that we need lead helmets with
[1934.94 - 1939.38] all these x-rays to protect your brain
[1936.50 - 1941.38] no so they're doing it on purpose
[1939.38 - 1945.50] foreign
[1941.38 - 1947.32] ER says sad but true former TSA Employee
[1945.50 - 1949.10] here whoa
[1947.32 - 1952.28] whoa
[1949.10 - 1954.74] I wish I knew what airport you worked at
[1952.28 - 1957.44] when you were at on TSA because I always
[1954.74 - 1958.94] get help off to the side and they go
[1957.44 - 1961.10] through my bags
[1958.94 - 1963.68] and I wouldn't need I needed you I
[1961.10 - 1966.14] needed you sad but true former TSA
[1963.68 - 1968.30] Employee here the sad part is we were
[1966.14 - 1971.18] more exposed to radiation than anyone
[1968.30 - 1974.30] else big time I lost a lot of co-workers
[1971.18 - 1977.36] from cancers and strokes teach
[1974.30 - 1980.12] I totally understand I
[1977.36 - 1981.20] me and SOC had conversations about it
[1980.12 - 1984.38] every time I was in an airport
[1981.20 - 1987.50] constantly about you guys and your job
[1984.38 - 1989.92] like I always felt for you guys always
[1987.50 - 1989.92] did
[1990.20 - 1995.66] always did oh my God my family my
[1993.50 - 1997.52] friends know because I've always talked
[1995.66 - 2000.84] about that very thing that you you know
[1997.52 - 2000.84] being a TSA officer
[2001.54 - 2006.28] and I wish I knew you when you were
[2003.16 - 2008.14] working there at whatever airport I
[2006.28 - 2010.66] would have liked to teach here
[2008.14 - 2013.96] hey it's TJ it's teach is teach here
[2010.66 - 2017.02] she's working today
[2013.96 - 2019.00] me tube787 says we produce poisons then
[2017.02 - 2020.74] we make more poisons to check for more
[2019.00 - 2022.78] poisons than we're recommended more
[2020.74 - 2024.82] poisons to combat the poisons what a
[2022.78 - 2026.08] crazy world and then we're recommended
[2024.82 - 2027.64] to get blood work because we're sick
[2026.08 - 2028.96] from the poisons and then we get sicker
[2027.64 - 2030.28] from the blood work and they recommend
[2028.96 - 2031.84] more blood work because we're sick for
[2030.28 - 2033.52] the voices and sick from the blood work
[2031.84 - 2035.26] and then they recommend more blood work
[2033.52 - 2036.70] and then when we're just about dead and
[2035.26 - 2038.62] we're laying there we can't even move
[2036.70 - 2039.70] they actually say you're going to need
[2038.62 - 2041.26] more blood work because we don't know
[2039.70 - 2043.18] why you're dying so they take more blood
[2041.26 - 2045.64] out of us and they make us sicker sicker
[2043.18 - 2048.78] and next thing you do it
[2045.64 - 2048.78] they try to kill us
[2050.62 - 2054.94] I'm not anti-blood work done properly
[2052.78 - 2058.44] I'm not anti-doctor go to your doctor
[2054.94 - 2058.44] ask your doctor what's right for you
[2060.94 - 2064.14] I have a lot of doctor friends
[2066.46 - 2070.02] I don't know my spot I have to find it
[2068.32 - 2074.52] so hang on
[2070.02 - 2074.52] SOC saying get somewhere down here
[2075.88 - 2079.72] and yet rarely if ever in the X-ray and
[2078.22 - 2080.92] scanning world do they offer you a lead
[2079.72 - 2083.38] helmet
[2080.92 - 2085.42] or protective headpiece so our brains
[2083.38 - 2087.22] are left exposed
[2085.42 - 2089.14] wild blueberry girl says that was a
[2087.22 - 2091.42] surgical tech for six years and they
[2089.14 - 2094.54] would sometimes do x-rays in surgery
[2091.42 - 2098.58] would just say for us to turn around and
[2094.54 - 2098.58] step 10 feet away still in the room
[2099.58 - 2107.10] and I 100 percent believe that because I
[2103.78 - 2107.10] have heard that before
[2108.10 - 2114.22] and I know that's 100 accurate
[2112.18 - 2115.84] I wouldn't need to have heard it before
[2114.22 - 2118.24] to know it's accurate because I know
[2115.84 - 2120.10] you're telling me exactly what happened
[2118.24 - 2121.72] but I've actually heard that
[2120.10 - 2124.92] unbelievable
[2121.72 - 2124.92] thank you for saying that
[2125.14 - 2128.98] that's why it's important for us to ask
[2127.06 - 2131.50] for additional bibs to help Shield the
[2128.98 - 2134.38] areas of the body we can and to work on
[2131.50 - 2137.74] the radiation removal protocols in this
[2134.38 - 2139.78] book spirulina
[2137.74 - 2142.36] or spirulina
[2139.78 - 2144.40] a key ingredient in medical medium
[2142.36 - 2147.06] protocols is essential for radiation
[2144.40 - 2147.06] exposure
[2147.46 - 2149.70] foreign
[2150.96 - 2157.30] awareness teach I might have put
[2154.36 - 2159.10] something in here SOG SOC might have put
[2157.30 - 2162.82] some in there
[2159.10 - 2164.62] Jackie I need that lemon balm 2aw they
[2162.82 - 2167.92] didn't put an apron on my son yesterday
[2164.62 - 2170.34] even though I told him to ask crap crap
[2167.92 - 2170.34] crap
[2170.98 - 2174.06] I totally understand
[2179.44 - 2184.44] I'm gonna put a
[2181.12 - 2184.44] Chopper full straight in
[2188.38 - 2194.50] goes into your bloodstream really fast
[2192.10 - 2197.62] Heidi Inman
[2194.50 - 2201.06] this knowledge is gold
[2197.62 - 2201.06] three explanation points
[2201.16 - 2206.28] airport awareness all right let's let's
[2203.38 - 2209.26] uh let's get rolling
[2206.28 - 2211.36] medical medium information has always
[2209.26 - 2214.24] warned about radiation contamination
[2211.36 - 2216.28] from airports and air travel
[2214.24 - 2218.68] there is so much radiation being
[2216.28 - 2222.84] admitted in airports that it would set
[2218.68 - 2222.84] off radiation detection technology
[2224.32 - 2228.10] what about fear you guys and Chaos this
[2226.42 - 2230.26] isn't about fear it's about knowing what
[2228.10 - 2233.26] what you're up against so you can make a
[2230.26 - 2234.94] decision and have a choice
[2233.26 - 2236.14] I think it's critical to have a choice
[2234.94 - 2237.94] and to know what you're up against you
[2236.14 - 2240.76] can protect yourself at least work on
[2237.94 - 2243.46] radiation protocols at least but the
[2240.76 - 2245.02] point is that you actually have a form
[2243.46 - 2246.58] of knowledge or you've got the
[2245.02 - 2248.08] empowerment empowerment is about
[2246.58 - 2250.56] knowledge it's about knowing what's
[2248.08 - 2250.56] going on
[2251.14 - 2254.68] no changes are going to be made if you
[2253.24 - 2256.90] don't know what's happening and you
[2254.68 - 2259.18] don't know what's going on
[2256.90 - 2261.90] can't make a change if you don't if you
[2259.18 - 2261.90] can't make a choice
[2263.74 - 2267.16] there's so much radiation being admitted
[2265.66 - 2269.86] in airports that it would actually set
[2267.16 - 2272.50] off detection radiation detection to
[2269.86 - 2275.56] technology get the words right aw while
[2272.50 - 2278.26] you were while you were walking through
[2275.56 - 2279.76] the rows of passengers waiting for their
[2278.26 - 2282.34] flights
[2279.76 - 2284.68] the device would go wild picking up
[2282.34 - 2287.92] radiation from all the freshly scanned
[2284.68 - 2290.86] people and knapsacks and carry-ons fresh
[2287.92 - 2293.02] off the scanner conveyor belts not now
[2290.86 - 2295.18] contaminated that's why it's good to be
[2293.02 - 2296.62] aware and proactive okay I just
[2295.18 - 2298.18] butchered that paragraph but I have to
[2296.62 - 2301.96] tell you something and this is important
[2298.18 - 2305.44] first of all people who say I'm a fear
[2301.96 - 2307.60] Monger are so off the mark
[2305.44 - 2310.18] so are we all supposed to just never
[2307.60 - 2312.52] know anything don't know about how to
[2310.18 - 2315.52] guard yourself when you get a blood test
[2312.52 - 2317.56] don't know how to get radiation out of
[2315.52 - 2319.96] your body don't know how to ask for some
[2317.56 - 2322.30] protected bibs when you go and get a
[2319.96 - 2325.54] procedure done
[2322.30 - 2327.70] an x-ray or you know
[2325.54 - 2329.38] um not talk about the truth about why
[2327.70 - 2331.54] people are sick so you never know why
[2329.38 - 2334.72] anybody got sick like am I supposed to
[2331.54 - 2338.38] just hide everything not give anybody
[2334.72 - 2340.42] any information and so so I don't put
[2338.38 - 2342.04] anybody in fear
[2340.42 - 2344.38] meanwhile
[2342.04 - 2346.90] people are actually working on healing
[2344.38 - 2348.70] with the medical medium info
[2346.90 - 2350.38] I'm doing in these incredible recipes
[2348.70 - 2352.90] and then someone will come along and be
[2350.38 - 2355.66] like orthorexia he's making you
[2352.90 - 2357.28] orthorexic okay then it's fine to go eat
[2355.66 - 2360.34] go eat whatever you want out there in
[2357.28 - 2362.74] the world don't think about your your
[2360.34 - 2364.84] your sickness and your problems and
[2362.74 - 2365.62] don't try to fix it go eat whatever you
[2364.84 - 2368.38] want
[2365.62 - 2371.44] go do whatever you want
[2368.38 - 2373.12] and it's not about that like mm info you
[2371.44 - 2375.22] could do anything you want but it's here
[2373.12 - 2377.14] for you when you want to partake in
[2375.22 - 2379.30] turning your life around when you want
[2377.14 - 2381.84] answers and you want to help yourself
[2379.30 - 2381.84] heal
[2386.02 - 2391.24] for one luggage
[2389.20 - 2393.46] okay this is interesting too I just want
[2391.24 - 2396.36] to say this
[2393.46 - 2396.36] in the airport
[2397.00 - 2402.46] if you had radiation technology
[2400.54 - 2404.80] detectors
[2402.46 - 2406.54] it would be it would show levels of
[2404.80 - 2408.28] radiation
[2406.54 - 2410.20] elevated radiation
[2408.28 - 2413.10] from the amount of exposure that happens
[2410.20 - 2413.10] in the airports
[2413.32 - 2417.58] for one luggage has to be discarded and
[2415.60 - 2419.56] purchased new periodically
[2417.58 - 2421.24] that's a medical medium recommendation
[2419.56 - 2424.24] you don't have to do that recommendation
[2421.24 - 2426.88] but that's a medical meme recommendation
[2424.24 - 2430.36] luggage has to be discarded and
[2426.88 - 2433.60] purchased new periodically when not in
[2430.36 - 2435.82] use keep luggage that has been on a
[2433.60 - 2438.24] flight far away from your children and
[2435.82 - 2438.24] pets
[2439.00 - 2443.68] because the luggage goes through the
[2441.40 - 2446.26] scanners
[2443.68 - 2448.18] and it's getting radiated heavy radiated
[2446.26 - 2450.16] right the luggage collects that
[2448.18 - 2453.94] radiation and keeps that radiation long
[2450.16 - 2457.00] term so if you store that luggage and
[2453.94 - 2460.18] that carry-on in those suitcases
[2457.00 - 2462.70] by say your baby's crib or in a Closet
[2460.18 - 2464.80] near your child or you know near your
[2462.70 - 2466.06] child's bed or whatever it is if you're
[2464.80 - 2467.74] storing it you have to be careful you
[2466.06 - 2469.12] have to get that that luggage out of
[2467.74 - 2470.94] there store it somewhere else if you
[2469.12 - 2474.10] don't want to throw it out I'm in page
[2470.94 - 2476.38] 239 right here in brain saver just
[2474.10 - 2479.22] letting you guys know and Airport
[2476.38 - 2479.22] awareness
[2481.06 - 2484.48] luggage has to be discarded and
[2482.68 - 2486.70] purchased new periodically when not in
[2484.48 - 2489.16] use keep luggage that has been on
[2486.70 - 2492.40] flights away from children and pets for
[2489.16 - 2494.70] an for another when you're going through
[2492.40 - 2494.70] security
[2494.74 - 2502.50] opt out of the full body scanner and ask
[2498.58 - 2502.50] for a pat down instead
[2502.90 - 2509.08] so there's a scanning machine
[2506.62 - 2511.96] there at the airport
[2509.08 - 2514.00] it's not the metal detector
[2511.96 - 2515.74] the metal detector kind of just looks
[2514.00 - 2518.68] like this gray thing that's like this
[2515.74 - 2520.36] right it's like a Gateway and you just
[2518.68 - 2522.82] walk right through that's the metal
[2520.36 - 2525.94] detector there at the airport
[2522.82 - 2528.46] okay that has no radiation coming out of
[2525.94 - 2530.44] it that's detecting from metal objects
[2528.46 - 2532.66] right
[2530.44 - 2535.60] but there's a scanner at the airport
[2532.66 - 2538.54] where you stand there and the doors
[2535.60 - 2540.04] revolve and a scan happens
[2538.54 - 2541.72] there's a couple of different scanners
[2540.04 - 2544.24] they have their different makes and
[2541.72 - 2545.68] models but there's a scanner
[2544.24 - 2548.86] now you can do what you want whatever
[2545.68 - 2551.14] but I tell my friends and my family
[2548.86 - 2553.12] to not do the scanner
[2551.14 - 2556.90] to just get a pat down
[2553.12 - 2559.78] so you ask he kindly asked tiesters can
[2556.90 - 2561.40] you give me a pat down
[2559.78 - 2563.68] and they fill you up
[2561.40 - 2564.88] they put their hands everywhere
[2563.68 - 2568.78] wherever
[2564.88 - 2571.72] but the point is is that you you don't
[2568.78 - 2573.70] have to then do the scanner if you stay
[2571.72 - 2575.68] on the side so they'll ask you well put
[2573.70 - 2577.42] your arms up
[2575.68 - 2578.56] Sarah put your arms up ma'am put your
[2577.42 - 2580.54] arms up
[2578.56 - 2582.82] spread your legs
[2580.54 - 2585.60] and you spread your legs and they pat
[2582.82 - 2585.60] down your body
[2589.62 - 2596.08] herbal Society
[2592.54 - 2599.50] says I'm I'm here the knowledge and
[2596.08 - 2601.12] respect for the work
[2599.50 - 2603.82] you do
[2601.12 - 2607.26] drop the gems
[2603.82 - 2607.26] drop the gems to the people
[2607.90 - 2610.56] thank you
[2613.60 - 2619.36] bertrude says it's amazing how much you
[2616.00 - 2622.56] care for people three hearts
[2619.36 - 2622.56] thank you I'm honored
[2622.90 - 2629.92] IG let's see Alpha Hoffman says I used
[2627.04 - 2632.26] to be a nuclear engineer whoa and
[2629.92 - 2634.78] probably got way more exposure
[2632.26 - 2636.64] than what they told us so grateful for
[2634.78 - 2639.10] this information to know how to protect
[2636.64 - 2640.96] myself incredible
[2639.10 - 2643.18] there's some smart people in the medical
[2640.96 - 2644.74] medium Community I mean you guys know
[2643.18 - 2646.18] you're smart just some smart the
[2644.74 - 2648.34] smartest group of people out there are
[2646.18 - 2651.10] in the medical medium community
[2648.34 - 2654.22] Amanda accusing someone of orthorexia
[2651.10 - 2657.10] while they're using mm protocols to hell
[2654.22 - 2659.20] to heal is evil
[2657.10 - 2660.64] I'm butchering comments today I can make
[2659.20 - 2662.74] these comments right
[2660.64 - 2664.78] I will read that one over though
[2662.74 - 2666.70] because that one blows my mind
[2664.78 - 2669.28] Amanda says accusing someone of
[2666.70 - 2671.86] orthorexia while they're using medical
[2669.28 - 2673.60] medium protocols to heal is evil and
[2671.86 - 2674.92] that's true okay I want to talk about
[2673.60 - 2676.54] that one second
[2674.92 - 2679.42] that is true
[2676.54 - 2683.14] there are even people that end up hating
[2679.42 - 2684.88] medical medium because they want to go
[2683.14 - 2686.38] and they want to do the whole shark
[2684.88 - 2688.12] thing they want to sell all their
[2686.38 - 2689.50] programs and sell all their stuff and
[2688.12 - 2691.96] they healed with medical medium
[2689.50 - 2694.18] information and then
[2691.96 - 2697.06] to lead people their way for their
[2694.18 - 2700.00] programs and everything they try to diss
[2697.06 - 2702.64] medical media and be like oh he's he's
[2700.00 - 2705.64] he'll make you orthorexic come over to
[2702.64 - 2708.94] my come over to my feed in my programs
[2705.64 - 2713.22] and buy my programs I'm not like him
[2708.94 - 2713.22] he's a jerk he's terrible
[2715.12 - 2718.78] all right
[2716.98 - 2721.00] for another when you're going through
[2718.78 - 2723.46] security opt out of the full body
[2721.00 - 2725.92] scanner and ask for a pat down instead
[2723.46 - 2728.08] it's perfectly safe to walk through a
[2725.92 - 2731.44] plain metal detector
[2728.08 - 2733.90] it's the airport body scanner device you
[2731.44 - 2735.94] want to avoid
[2733.90 - 2737.56] as you're waiting for your pat down try
[2735.94 - 2739.48] not to lean against the radiation
[2737.56 - 2741.88] machine that's being used to examine
[2739.48 - 2743.32] carry-ons did you hear that
[2741.88 - 2745.54] critical
[2743.32 - 2747.52] this is critical teach you know you know
[2745.54 - 2750.82] the machine I'm talking about right
[2747.52 - 2753.64] you got to know that machine
[2750.82 - 2756.94] as you're waiting for your pat down
[2753.64 - 2760.24] try not to lean against the radiation
[2756.94 - 2762.22] machine that's being used to examine
[2760.24 - 2764.14] carry-ons
[2762.22 - 2766.12] so you're waiting for your pat down and
[2764.14 - 2769.00] they'll be like stand here sir ma'am
[2766.12 - 2771.58] stand here right and when they when you
[2769.00 - 2773.44] go to stand there you might stand really
[2771.58 - 2775.00] close to the radiation machine so you
[2773.44 - 2777.42] got to kind of like just stand a few
[2775.00 - 2777.42] feet away
[2782.50 - 2786.28] try to stay on a few feet or more away
[2784.42 - 2789.36] from the machine that's processing and
[2786.28 - 2789.36] irritating baggage
[2790.96 - 2794.80] this is interesting I want to read this
[2793.36 - 2798.24] next part
[2794.80 - 2801.64] if you guys are open to it
[2798.24 - 2803.68] extraterrestrial space travel
[2801.64 - 2805.36] first of all do you believe in aliens do
[2803.68 - 2808.30] you believe in alien sightings alien
[2805.36 - 2810.82] spacecrafts do you believe in ETS you
[2808.30 - 2812.62] believe in
[2810.82 - 2815.26] right
[2812.62 - 2817.48] space creatures do you believe that
[2815.26 - 2820.96] there are real sightings on the planet
[2817.48 - 2824.76] do you believe that there are aliens
[2820.96 - 2824.76] flying in our atmosphere
[2824.80 - 2829.86] in spacecrafts
[2826.60 - 2829.86] do you believe in any of that
[2832.36 - 2835.72] you don't have to believe in aliens you
[2834.46 - 2837.04] don't have to believe that there are
[2835.72 - 2839.20] real sightings out there you don't have
[2837.04 - 2841.24] to believe the government's been hiding
[2839.20 - 2842.86] all these all this information about all
[2841.24 - 2843.94] the different alien encounters and all
[2842.86 - 2845.62] that you don't have to believe in any of
[2843.94 - 2847.96] that right it's okay I'm not saying that
[2845.62 - 2849.64] you have to believe in aliens
[2847.96 - 2852.34] I'm not telling you you should believe
[2849.64 - 2855.04] in them I'm just wondering if you do if
[2852.34 - 2856.84] you do believe in aliens in space travel
[2855.04 - 2859.18] and spacecrafts
[2856.84 - 2862.42] and all that right you guys do never
[2859.18 - 2864.64] seen one but yes you guys believe right
[2862.42 - 2866.02] a whole bit you guys know I have a
[2864.64 - 2868.00] medical meme podcast at Apple podcast
[2866.02 - 2869.02] and alien episode you might want to
[2868.00 - 2870.40] listen to it if you haven't heard that
[2869.02 - 2871.96] alien episode
[2870.40 - 2874.12] but I want to read this next part if
[2871.96 - 2877.78] you're okay
[2874.12 - 2880.60] extra terrestrial space travel
[2877.78 - 2883.06] what some might call alien ships
[2880.60 - 2886.20] also leave radiation in the atmosphere
[2883.06 - 2886.20] as they pass through
[2886.78 - 2890.98] isn't that incredible
[2889.00 - 2893.44] Who would know that
[2890.98 - 2896.38] I haven't heard anybody talk about that
[2893.44 - 2898.48] that radiation is increasing because of
[2896.38 - 2900.64] alien space travel but I haven't heard
[2898.48 - 2902.08] anybody talk about that Spirit of
[2900.64 - 2903.58] compassion put that piece of information
[2902.08 - 2906.52] in there
[2903.58 - 2908.88] of course I was asking for some cool
[2906.52 - 2908.88] stuff
[2909.40 - 2913.50] I was like Spirit compassion can you
[2910.96 - 2915.94] give me some cool stuff
[2913.50 - 2917.74] neurotoxins is getting so boring yes I
[2915.94 - 2919.18] know neurotoxins caused so many problems
[2917.74 - 2921.76] with everybody's illnesses at chronic
[2919.18 - 2923.38] fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia I know
[2921.76 - 2924.94] Epstein-Barr creates multiple sclerosis
[2923.38 - 2928.26] and all these things but give me some
[2924.94 - 2928.26] cool stuff we're on radiation
[2928.90 - 2933.28] and snc said extraterrestrial space
[2931.18 - 2935.32] travel which some might call alien ships
[2933.28 - 2937.30] also leave radiation in the atmosphere
[2935.32 - 2941.32] as they pass through
[2937.30 - 2942.28] so we're having radiation exposure from
[2941.32 - 2944.86] ETS
[2942.28 - 2946.36] passing through all those sightings all
[2944.86 - 2948.22] the spacecrafts that are on this planet
[2946.36 - 2951.10] that are flying around in the atmosphere
[2948.22 - 2952.54] they're spreading a lot of radiation
[2951.10 - 2954.82] here we are working worried about
[2952.54 - 2958.02] climate climate climb climate what no
[2954.82 - 2958.02] one's even talking about this
[2959.56 - 2966.10] UFO sightings are not totally understood
[2962.80 - 2967.66] sure they are the radiation coming from
[2966.10 - 2970.00] these crafts
[2967.66 - 2972.22] is not the normal radiation we
[2970.00 - 2974.80] experience here
[2972.22 - 2976.96] rather it's radiation of another kind
[2974.80 - 2979.54] that gets into the atmosphere so here's
[2976.96 - 2982.42] the Killer part that was mind-blowing
[2979.54 - 2983.50] for me it's not just the thought of that
[2982.42 - 2985.36] we're getting all this radiation
[2983.50 - 2987.94] exposure from the amount of alien
[2985.36 - 2989.38] spacecraft travel happening around the
[2987.94 - 2992.50] planet
[2989.38 - 2994.90] but it's the type of radiation it's a
[2992.50 - 2997.66] different form of radiation
[2994.90 - 2999.22] then what we're creating down here so
[2997.66 - 3001.68] there's two kinds of radiation affecting
[2999.22 - 3004.68] us what we're creating down here
[3001.68 - 3006.96] and then the radiation
[3004.68 - 3008.52] that's actually entering through space
[3006.96 - 3011.18] travel
[3008.52 - 3011.18] spacecraft
[3018.06 - 3021.14] that's incredible really
[3027.00 - 3035.72] um JL says aw thanks so much
[3030.42 - 3039.60] my sister is now 18 months without
[3035.72 - 3042.06] medicated drugs including penicillin and

[3071.28 - 3077.76] you guys I shall now get into radiation
[3074.76 - 3079.86] exposure shot
[3077.76 - 3082.52] Branch out therapy
[3079.86 - 3082.52] here we are
[3084.12 - 3088.86] there's a IG comment that podcast
[3086.22 - 3090.48] episode was mind altering mermail says
[3088.86 - 3092.58] You must be talking about the alien
[3090.48 - 3094.02] podcast episode medical meme podcast at
[3092.58 - 3098.52] Apple podcast
[3094.02 - 3102.38] the alien episode that was definitely a
[3098.52 - 3102.38] really powerful episode
[3102.78 - 3108.42] this is a supported it a supportive shot
[3106.08 - 3110.82] for circumstances such as airplane
[3108.42 - 3112.92] travel
[3110.82 - 3117.86] walking through airports or being close
[3112.92 - 3117.86] to airport scanners or baggage scanners
[3118.02 - 3123.00] being close to luggage that has gone
[3120.24 - 3126.44] through airport scanners
[3123.00 - 3130.02] medical testing such as CT scans X-rays
[3126.44 - 3132.60] fluoroscopy and even MRIS
[3130.02 - 3135.06] being around others who have had medical
[3132.60 - 3137.58] testing such as CAT scans X-rays
[3135.06 - 3140.70] fluoroscopy and MRIS
[3137.58 - 3142.62] exposure to computerized devices
[3140.70 - 3144.84] I got no exposure to computerized
[3142.62 - 3148.32] devices
[3144.84 - 3150.66] not I do have exposure to computerized
[3148.32 - 3153.42] devices
[3150.66 - 3156.06] and this radiation exposure shot is good
[3153.42 - 3159.18] after a sunburn
[3156.06 - 3160.50] that's another time you can use it
[3159.18 - 3162.78] hmm
[3160.50 - 3165.60] with all that all the time I have in the
[3162.78 - 3170.58] world to just go out
[3165.60 - 3173.88] in my swimsuit and bathe sunbathe in the
[3170.58 - 3176.40] Sun for hours
[3173.88 - 3178.26] I don't have any time to do that but
[3176.40 - 3181.40] don't do that for hours that's not a
[3178.26 - 3181.40] good idea don't do that for hours
[3182.04 - 3188.96] all right
[3184.14 - 3188.96] we are doing the radiation exposure shot
[3192.24 - 3198.06] comment if really kicked in but what it
[3195.24 - 3199.38] has done it has calmed me down so much
[3198.06 - 3205.14] because
[3199.38 - 3208.10] I took a decent amount in my
[3205.14 - 3208.10] hot water here
[3208.62 - 3213.36] but it's definitely
[3210.78 - 3215.88] really calmed me down
[3213.36 - 3218.82] that's my experience in the moment
[3215.88 - 3221.10] happening right now CD says hi Anthony
[3218.82 - 3223.56] so happy to have you around I wouldn't
[3221.10 - 3226.80] be where I am today without you
[3223.56 - 3228.06] are all the energy products safe while
[3226.80 - 3232.50] pregnant
[3228.06 - 3235.32] it's just cut those guys those guys talk
[3232.50 - 3236.82] um those guys communicate I mean just
[3235.32 - 3239.28] reach out to the emergency company ask
[3236.82 - 3241.56] them any questions you need to ask them
[3239.28 - 3244.56] but check with your doctor that's easy
[3241.56 - 3247.76] because your situation
[3244.56 - 3247.76] and she'd always ask your doctor
[3250.50 - 3257.48] well

[3299.16 - 3303.66] we got the machine running
[3301.98 - 3305.40] so I'm starting out with the cilantro
[3303.66 - 3309.50] first
[3305.40 - 3309.50] half cup tightly packed cilantro
[3313.32 - 3321.54] I got my cilantro right here this is
[3317.34 - 3324.68] radiation exposure brain shot therapy
[3321.54 - 3324.68] is what this is
[3328.74 - 3333.20] getting my cilantro down in here
[3335.88 - 3341.40] now I'm using
[3338.76 - 3343.68] the wild blueberry powder you can do
[3341.40 - 3345.66] frozen wild blueberries fresh wild
[3343.68 - 3347.76] blueberries a half cup of Frozen or
[3345.66 - 3349.80] fresh you can choose to do that you can
[3347.76 - 3353.82] do two tablespoons of wild blueberry
[3349.80 - 3357.32] juice or one tablespoon of the wild
[3353.82 - 3357.32] blueberry powder right here
[3357.84 - 3362.24] but I'm going to go with the asparagus
[3359.82 - 3362.24] right now
[3362.88 - 3366.48] because I want to make sure I'm able to
[3364.92 - 3369.02] mix that in because I'm going to go with
[3366.48 - 3369.02] the powder
[3373.32 - 3380.82] I love juicing asparagus it is actually
[3378.48 - 3383.22] like one of my favorites
[3380.82 - 3387.18] these are small Spears
[3383.22 - 3390.42] it says four raw medium Spears
[3387.18 - 3391.98] and I've seen Spears that big like just
[3390.42 - 3394.08] large ones and these are actually really
[3391.98 - 3399.18] tiny so I'm going to put a few in there
[3394.08 - 3401.52] all right one stalk of celery please
[3399.18 - 3403.86] such nice celery right here I like when
[3401.52 - 3406.68] I have nice celery you know how it can
[3403.86 - 3408.90] come spindly lots of leaves and just
[3406.68 - 3411.72] really spindly right just really nice
[3408.90 - 3414.50] celery right here
[3411.72 - 3414.50] we go
[3415.14 - 3420.42] we got just enough for a shot
[3417.78 - 3423.26] now I can mix in a couple of things here
[3420.42 - 3423.26] which is going to be
[3423.78 - 3428.18] I'm just making sure this gets all the
[3425.70 - 3428.18] juice out
[3429.12 - 3431.72] nice
[3432.36 - 3436.28] all right then we're going to mix this
[3433.86 - 3436.28] in here
[3439.20 - 3442.04] right
[3440.28 - 3445.44] next thing is
[3442.04 - 3447.90] blueberry powder
[3445.44 - 3450.14] one tablespoon
[3447.90 - 3453.24] I'm gonna get a measuring
[3450.14 - 3456.38] spoon here
[3453.24 - 3456.38] one tablespoon
[3457.62 - 3461.94] this is incredible by the way
[3459.90 - 3464.72] so that's the vimergi wild blueberry
[3461.94 - 3464.72] powder right there
[3465.60 - 3468.68] gonna drop that in
[3469.56 - 3473.12] now I'm going to add
[3475.50 - 3478.52] some spirulina
[3480.32 - 3485.94] spirulina is half
[3483.78 - 3489.38] tablespoon I think it's a half teaspoon
[3485.94 - 3489.38] I think so let me get that that's
[3491.22 - 3493.64] nice
[3493.80 - 3497.24] a half teaspoon in there
[3498.96 - 3502.46] barley grass juice powder
[3502.80 - 3506.76] and bird says hello can I use barley
[3505.08 - 3508.32] grass instead of barley grass juice
[3506.76 - 3510.66] powder
[3508.32 - 3512.16] nope it's it's an entirely different
[3510.66 - 3516.26] creature it's an entirely different
[3512.16 - 3516.26] Beast it it doesn't work
[3516.90 - 3523.68] it has to be
[3520.26 - 3526.64] the juice powder putting a little bit of
[3523.68 - 3526.64] that in there now too
[3532.44 - 3535.44] yep
[3533.82 - 3537.48] I'll tell you why because the barley
[3535.44 - 3539.70] grass is barley grass it's chopped up
[3537.48 - 3542.70] dehydrated grass
[3539.70 - 3546.24] so there's no potency to it it's just
[3542.70 - 3547.50] straight grass and it's also irritating
[3546.24 - 3548.82] for a lot of people with their
[3547.50 - 3551.52] intestinal tracts because it's
[3548.82 - 3554.10] scratching grass but if here's the thing
[3551.52 - 3556.26] it's scratchy dehydrated grass that's a
[3554.10 - 3558.06] difference that's barley grass barley
[3556.26 - 3559.92] grass is not what this is so that's
[3558.06 - 3562.38] really important to know this is barley
[3559.92 - 3565.62] grass juice powder it's the extraction
[3562.38 - 3567.96] the juice itself the grass the scratchy
[3565.62 - 3570.48] grass was left behind this is actually
[3567.96 - 3572.70] the juice and the juice only so that's
[3570.48 - 3574.38] what it is and then you know and then
[3572.70 - 3576.48] it's fried right it's dehydrated so it's
[3574.38 - 3578.88] the barley grass juice powder now here's
[3576.48 - 3580.26] what's incredible and beverage is the
[3578.88 - 3582.12] only company with my knowledge that's
[3580.26 - 3585.86] ever done this they don't have the
[3582.12 - 3590.34] caking agents they do they don't
[3585.86 - 3591.78] apply caking agents or bonding agents
[3590.34 - 3593.16] inside their powder so here's how it
[3591.78 - 3595.56] works all the green powders out there
[3593.16 - 3598.80] all the different powders whether it's
[3595.56 - 3600.36] mushroom powders reishi powders chaga
[3598.80 - 3603.72] powders
[3600.36 - 3605.76] um spirulina powders barley grass
[3603.72 - 3607.26] powders whatever whatever powders that
[3605.76 - 3609.30] are out there vegetable and fruit
[3607.26 - 3611.04] powders all the different powders that
[3609.30 - 3612.72] are out there you guys there's hundreds
[3611.04 - 3614.10] of companies doing powders now just
[3612.72 - 3617.72] powder everything
[3614.10 - 3621.54] there there are undisclosed
[3617.72 - 3623.58] bonding agents to stop the powder from
[3621.54 - 3625.62] sticking together
[3623.58 - 3627.72] that means the companies that have all
[3625.62 - 3628.86] these different powders out there think
[3627.72 - 3630.60] about this
[3628.86 - 3633.72] all the different powders have an
[3630.60 - 3638.40] ingredient or ingredients that you don't
[3633.72 - 3642.42] know about that's a non-caking agent
[3638.40 - 3646.20] so it's a non-bonding agent so they put
[3642.42 - 3648.66] these these anti-bonding agents and
[3646.20 - 3651.54] caking agents into the powders so you're
[3648.66 - 3653.52] like oh you know my my you know my
[3651.54 - 3655.02] person here told me to do these to do
[3653.52 - 3658.32] these powders here and here's a green
[3655.02 - 3661.14] powder and here's another powder
[3658.32 - 3663.06] and I got the best powder or I got this
[3661.14 - 3664.32] powder or chlorella but what people
[3663.06 - 3669.36] don't realize
[3664.32 - 3672.42] is they put in the anti-caking agent and
[3669.36 - 3675.84] the anti-bonding agent so that the
[3672.42 - 3678.30] powders wouldn't Clump together but they
[3675.84 - 3681.06] don't put the ingredient on the bottle
[3678.30 - 3683.70] so when they use the anti-caking agent
[3681.06 - 3685.32] they don't put it on the bottle so when
[3683.70 - 3686.82] you read the bottle you're like let's
[3685.32 - 3689.58] see there's
[3686.82 - 3691.62] spinach in here spinach powder there's
[3689.58 - 3693.54] beet powder there's
[3691.62 - 3695.40] chlorella there's whatever you're
[3693.54 - 3697.16] reading all the ingredients but what
[3695.40 - 3699.62] you're not reading is
[3697.16 - 3702.24] anti-caking Agent
[3699.62 - 3703.98] anti-bonding agent and you won't read
[3702.24 - 3706.38] that on the on the bottle it's
[3703.98 - 3708.18] undisclosed they're allowed to do it the
[3706.38 - 3710.22] emergency swore they would never do that
[3708.18 - 3711.72] so the beverages powders and it's just
[3710.22 - 3714.90] like this across the board with energy
[3711.72 - 3717.18] their stuff is unmatched right because
[3714.90 - 3721.56] they
[3717.18 - 3724.92] choose not to ever put the anti-caking
[3721.56 - 3727.86] agents in these powders their mushroom
[3724.92 - 3729.84] powders their their green powders they
[3727.86 - 3731.52] don't do that critical to know Kelsey
[3729.84 - 3735.02] box says can you do this shop before an
[3731.52 - 3735.02] x-ray to protect yourself I would
[3735.18 - 3739.80] I would if it was me or a family member
[3737.88 - 3740.58] and I said I would definitely do it and
[3739.80 - 3742.68] after
[3740.58 - 3744.18] I would do it after
[3742.68 - 3746.16] so I just wanted people to know it's
[3744.18 - 3747.20] another reason why I endorsed themergy
[3746.16 - 3749.46] and that's critical to understand
[3747.20 - 3752.16] because when you think about what that
[3749.46 - 3754.62] is it's insane
[3752.16 - 3757.02] it's insane
[3754.62 - 3759.30] so
[3757.02 - 3761.42] who does that
[3759.30 - 3763.98] I don't care what anybody says
[3761.42 - 3765.54] undisclosed they secretly put they don't
[3763.98 - 3767.58] just tell anybody they put the antibody
[3765.54 - 3768.96] bonding agents in there the details
[3767.58 - 3770.58] matter when it comes down to healing and
[3768.96 - 3773.16] that's that's the difference because
[3770.58 - 3774.66] memory is thinking about people who
[3773.16 - 3776.04] aren't well they're thinking about their
[3774.66 - 3777.08] customers or think about all these
[3776.04 - 3780.60] things and
[3777.08 - 3784.26] they wouldn't want anti-caking agents
[3780.60 - 3786.30] and anti-bonding agents inside their
[3784.26 - 3789.00] spirulina inside their barley grass
[3786.30 - 3791.22] juice powder inside their chaga powder
[3789.00 - 3792.90] inside their Rishi powder whatever they
[3791.22 - 3794.82] would never want that in there either
[3792.90 - 3796.74] but see it's not about that when it
[3794.82 - 3797.94] comes down to supplements out there in
[3796.74 - 3800.78] the world
[3797.94 - 3800.78] it's just about
[3800.88 - 3804.66] bottom line
[3802.14 - 3806.10] people will say oh this made me not feel
[3804.66 - 3808.14] well
[3806.10 - 3809.64] so much of the time that they have they
[3808.14 - 3811.26] don't realize that they have bad quality
[3809.64 - 3813.36] products out there with all kinds of
[3811.26 - 3814.44] anti-caking agents and bonding agents
[3813.36 - 3816.36] and
[3814.44 - 3819.24] and they don't even know but no don't
[3816.36 - 3823.74] use barley grass powder
[3819.24 - 3825.42] barley grass powder is grass that was
[3823.74 - 3827.28] mulched up
[3825.42 - 3830.22] and thrown in there
[3827.28 - 3833.28] it's scratchy it's dehydrated
[3830.22 - 3838.28] it doesn't do what it needs to do that's
[3833.28 - 3838.28] not barley grass juice powder
[3838.32 - 3842.10] I'm not even going into the quality of
[3840.54 - 3843.96] what these are which is a whole other
[3842.10 - 3846.84] level I could be here all day and and
[3843.96 - 3848.64] the quality is insane anyway I'm gonna
[3846.84 - 3850.62] mix this up
[3848.64 - 3853.50] I'm just talking about that so if you
[3850.62 - 3855.66] see it clumped if you see a clump in the
[3853.50 - 3858.30] in the jar in the bottle you see it
[3855.66 - 3862.40] plump that's what you want you want to
[3858.30 - 3862.40] see it Clump because you don't you know
[3868.62 - 3872.58] that's the whole point it means it
[3870.54 - 3874.08] wasn't the bonding agents weren't added
[3872.58 - 3877.20] in there
[3874.08 - 3878.76] the anti-bonding agents all right
[3877.20 - 3881.76] we got it
[3878.76 - 3881.76] foreign
[3882.96 - 3887.22] have I gotten any radiation exposure
[3885.36 - 3890.52] recently
[3887.22 - 3892.86] yeah I have
[3890.52 - 3896.88] I have done radiation exposure
[3892.86 - 3899.22] [Music]
[3896.88 - 3902.88] friend of mine got out of an airport
[3899.22 - 3904.03] [Music]
[3902.88 - 3907.34] gave him a hug
[3904.03 - 3907.34] [Music]
[3908.40 - 3911.54] got off the plane
[3912.24 - 3919.58] saturated radiation
[3914.94 - 3919.58] I got some exposure and I knew it
[3919.98 - 3923.48] that's why I'm happy about this
[3926.22 - 3933.12] [Music]
[3929.94 - 3937.11] why does this one taste so good
[3933.12 - 3937.11] [Music]
[3939.36 - 3944.11] [Music]
[3942.72 - 3948.78] so good
[3944.11 - 3952.64] [Music]
[3948.78 - 3952.64] I like knowing I'm protecting myself
[3954.51 - 3957.80] [Music]
[3955.86 - 3959.26] um
[3957.80 - 3960.60] I want more
[3959.26 - 3963.38] [Music]
[3960.60 - 3963.38] so good
[3963.72 - 3966.56] should I ask
[3967.68 - 3972.78] bartender
[3969.72 - 3975.62] hello bartender

[4003.74 - 4008.18] oh God
[4006.14 - 4011.18] the feelings I get when I do the
[4008.18 - 4013.64] radiation shot exposure radiation
[4011.18 - 4016.88] exposure shot
[4013.64 - 4019.60] is an entire whole body from head down
[4016.88 - 4019.60] to my toe
[4023.18 - 4028.10] like it's everywhere
[4025.58 - 4030.56] it's not the normal Sensations I get
[4028.10 - 4033.20] from the other brain shot therapies it's
[4030.56 - 4035.18] different it's from my head down to the
[4033.20 - 4036.56] bottom of my feet but I feel like
[4035.18 - 4040.34] there's
[4036.56 - 4043.16] an aura going all around me like I feel
[4040.34 - 4045.14] like there's energy going all around me
[4043.16 - 4047.00] when I take this every time I take this
[4045.14 - 4049.04] one because I get exposed
[4047.00 - 4050.66] periodically
[4049.04 - 4052.64] and every time I get exposed to
[4050.66 - 4053.96] radiation and I say you know what I'm
[4052.64 - 4056.24] going to do the radiation exposure shot
[4053.96 - 4059.96] and I take it I feel like it it right
[4056.24 - 4062.06] about out here this far I feel an energy
[4059.96 - 4065.06] that's surrounding me that's what I feel
[4062.06 - 4066.98] what do you guys feel let me know how
[4065.06 - 4068.84] you feel

[4068.84 - 4074.24] a story please let me know your
[4071.90 - 4076.58] experience with the radiation exposure
[4074.24 - 4079.82] shot what's your feeling I would love to
[4076.58 - 4082.04] see it tag a medical medium medical
[4079.82 - 4083.48] medium Huntress Divine says how often
[4082.04 - 4086.18] should the shots be done if you're
[4083.48 - 4088.40] exposed to them daily can I just do them
[4086.18 - 4090.44] once a week you can totally do them once
[4088.40 - 4092.06] a week if you're exposed to radiation on
[4090.44 - 4093.26] a daily level because you work in the
[4092.06 - 4095.72] field
[4093.26 - 4097.94] of medicine or anywhere else you just
[4095.72 - 4101.18] take every couple of days then take take
[4097.94 - 4103.88] a shot every few days sure
[4101.18 - 4107.68] Heidi Inman the blood work chapter and

[4536.36 - 4539.84] and the radiation exposure issues out
[4538.52 - 4540.92] there and all the different things that
[4539.84 - 4542.84] are happening the medical medium
[4540.92 - 4544.22] information is in these books it's out
[4542.84 - 4548.36] there
