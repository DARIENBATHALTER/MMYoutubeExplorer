[38.64 - 46.16] it's time to get answers welcome to the
[41.72 - 46.16] medical medium podcast I'm Anthony
[46.96 - 52.56] William hey everybody today we're doing
[50.04 - 55.84] a powerful brain meditation for letting
[52.56 - 58.76] go of fear and riding fear from our soul
[55.84 - 61.32] spirit and heart fear is something that
[58.76 - 64.20] becomes a part of of our soul and it
[61.32 - 66.56] gets in the way of who we truly are and
[64.20 - 71.12] it can end up taking away a piece of who
[66.56 - 74.20] we are and shadowing who we aspire to
[71.12 - 78.08] be as we go through life and live
[74.20 - 81.80] through hardships betrayal broken trust
[78.08 - 85.12] losses broken friendships relationships
[81.80 - 88.48] or emotional struggles of any kind we
[85.12 - 91.72] have small outof body experiences where
[88.48 - 94.16] our soul lead Lees our brain and body
[91.72 - 97.60] and a disconnect happens and there
[94.16 - 102.44] becomes an empty space between our soul
[97.60 - 105.48] and brain a distance and fear fills the
[102.44 - 108.48] Gap this meditation is about taking
[105.48 - 112.72] control over your life not letting fear
[108.48 - 115.28] run you or own you in any way this will
[112.72 - 117.64] allow your neurons that are in the
[115.28 - 120.88] emotional Center of your brain to
[117.64 - 124.00] reconnect to your soul and redirect
[120.88 - 127.40] their messaging away from Fear pushing

[844.96 - 852.52] grippy it doesn't make
[847.76 - 856.76] sense how did it get here from the other
[852.52 - 861.88] side behind the puppy is a hole in the
[856.76 - 861.88] bridge and behind that hole is debris

[914.44 - 922.12] safe all of a
[916.48 - 922.12] sudden a leash appears attached to the
[922.48 - 927.00] puppy and at the other end of the leash

[927.00 - 931.52] person who offers a delightful
[931.84 - 938.28] smile you think how is this

[951.28 - 957.88] trust step by step on this
[954.60 - 961.40] bridge as you discover pieces of the

[1310.20 - 1315.40] lifting you are almost at the end of the
[1312.96 - 1315.40] bridge
[1315.52 - 1320.24] now you get to the last step of the
[1323.28 - 1327.32] bridge and you're standing
[1327.48 - 1334.36] there and the person who's been calling
[1330.64 - 1336.40] you all along from the other side is
[1334.36 - 1342.48] standing there as
[1336.40 - 1346.28] well right in front of you waiting for
[1342.48 - 1349.72] you and it becomes
[1346.28 - 1351.20] clear this person
[1349.72 - 1354.92] was
[1351.20 - 1354.92] you this whole
[1361.64 - 1368.20] time your soul was
[1364.80 - 1371.88] waiting at the other end of the
[1368.20 - 1375.48] bridge and the fear that was keeping you
[1371.88 - 1375.48] apart is now
[1376.96 - 1382.80] gone
[1379.68 - 1382.80] now take a deep breath
[1386.36 - 1389.60] in and
[1393.32 - 1398.32] release you can now open your
[1401.72 - 1408.36] eyes we don't realize that when we go
[1405.24 - 1411.36] through life our soul becomes in injured
[1408.36 - 1414.64] from betrayal and broken trust and this
[1411.36 - 1417.60] creates fear within us this hinders the
[1414.64 - 1420.80] bridge between our soul and our physical
[1417.60 - 1423.44] brain and this bridge is the connection
[1420.80 - 1425.48] that allows us to feel safe and to trust
[1423.44 - 1428.40] again and not live in
[1425.48 - 1431.32] fear you have now completed the
[1428.40 - 1433.68] meditation that Bridges your soul to
[1431.32 - 1436.16] your physical neurons in the emotional
[1433.68 - 1439.84] Center of your brain so that the
[1436.16 - 1443.24] connection between them grows strong and
[1439.84 - 1446.56] fear and broken trust won't hold you
[1443.24 - 1449.36] back feel free to repeat this meditation
[1446.56 - 1452.64] daily every other day or a couple times
[1449.36 - 1455.92] a week because each time it only becomes
[1452.64 - 1459.64] more powerful in its ability to mend the
[1455.92 - 1465.72] bridge between your soul and your
[1459.64 - 1465.72] body I believe in you and I know you can
[1466.80 - 1469.80] heal
[1471.92 - 1477.76] [Music]
