[3.68 - 7.40] so I'm on here right now because I want
[5.20 - 10.08] to show you a couple tips one when
[7.40 - 12.64] there's smoke in the air because of the
[10.08 - 13.92] LA fires right now things are really bad
[12.64 - 15.60] for a lot of people I mean it's
[13.92 - 17.92] devastating I'm sure you guys have seen
[15.60 - 20.72] it out there people losing their homes
[17.92 - 23.88] people losing their Farms their
[20.72 - 27.56] businesses their family's homes their
[23.88 - 30.48] apartment buildings they're losing their
[27.56 - 31.56] places to live massive
[30.48 - 34.92] I mean there's all kinds of things
[31.56 - 36.56] people are evacuating all around in LA
[34.92 - 38.60] and trying to get out there so anyway I
[36.56 - 41.72] just wanted to come on here just uh for
[38.60 - 43.56] a couple of tips number one um I think
[41.72 - 47.12] one of the big things is because the air
[43.56 - 51.60] is so dry so so
[47.12 - 53.56] dry that the Ash and the air it just
[51.60 - 55.56] cuts through it just gets into the lungs
[53.56 - 58.40] really easily and I think that's really
[55.56 - 60.20] hard for a lot of people so one of the
[58.40 - 63.16] things that you can do is you can like
[60.20 - 65.40] an n95 mask it's going to help a little
[63.16 - 67.56] bit I mean it's obviously not going to
[65.40 - 70.36] protect you with flames and heavy heavy
[67.56 - 73.48] smoke but it can actually block some of
[70.36 - 76.68] the ashes it can block some of the thick
[73.48 - 78.56] smoke some of the toxins that are in the
[76.68 - 81.08] smoke like the chemicals and things that
[78.56 - 85.60] are burning in furniture and
[81.08 - 88.56] carpets and wall boards and treated wood
[85.60 - 90.76] all that and plaster all that stuff
[88.56 - 93.96] that's burning that's really toxic from
[90.76 - 95.72] houses and homes so um you know there's
[93.96 - 97.16] a couple of uh tricks I want to show
[95.72 - 99.84] people while we're here you guys coming
[97.16 - 101.64] on right here this is great but I want
[99.84 - 104.88] to First all first of all I want to just
[101.64 - 107.44] say that if you are if you were coming
[104.88 - 109.40] to the Cafe Gratitude popup dinners the
[107.44 - 113.24] medical medium Cafe Gratitude pop-up
[109.40 - 117.12] dinners January 15th January 16th we are
[113.24 - 118.60] postponing those dinners so check your
[117.12 - 120.92] email because there's going to be
[118.60 - 123.40] notices going out to you if you did
[120.92 - 126.28] purchase a ticket for that popup dinner
[123.40 - 128.76] on the 15th or the 16th we're postponing
[126.28 - 130.96] it just you know for for a lot of
[128.76 - 132.84] reasons one is just for protective
[130.96 - 135.16] Health measures and everything else it's
[132.84 - 137.56] really Smoky and so forth out there but
[135.16 - 139.36] at the same time Cafe Gratitude is
[137.56 - 140.92] they're open and they have medical
[139.36 - 143.28] medium dishes there so if you're
[140.92 - 145.32] somebody you know and you need to grab
[143.28 - 147.20] some food that's a place to grab some
[145.32 - 148.88] really healthy food which is really
[147.20 - 150.28] great you can grab a medical medium dish
[148.88 - 152.32] in there if you're somebody that's doing
[150.28 - 154.60] medical medium tools and medical medium
[152.32 - 156.68] Foods so that's what's amazing about the
[154.60 - 158.48] maafe gratitude that they they're there
[156.68 - 161.36] and they have medical medium food on
[158.48 - 163.60] hand so if you're traveling through or
[161.36 - 167.60] if you're relocating in the area you can
[163.60 - 169.60] run in and you can get food there um you
[167.60 - 172.24] know dishes there which is really
[169.60 - 174.32] incredible so but if you happen to have
[172.24 - 177.12] a ticket it's next week was supposed to
[174.32 - 179.28] be next week on the 15th and the 16th if
[177.12 - 182.16] you did have a ticket and you were
[179.28 - 184.04] coming to LA to be there for the meet
[182.16 - 186.92] and greet with me I'm not going to be
[184.04 - 189.80] there so we're postponing it and we'll
[186.92 - 191.60] have dates pretty soon just not yet and
[189.80 - 194.40] you'll get a refund in a whole bit and
[191.60 - 196.36] then we will send out some notices and
[194.40 - 199.24] such such so that you can actually get
[196.36 - 201.04] the tickets again and all that um so
[199.24 - 202.76] it's going to be great but right now
[201.04 - 204.60] there's a lot of Devastation happening
[202.76 - 207.52] you guys know I want to go I want to
[204.60 - 211.32] cover a couple of points first is
[207.52 - 213.88] because the air is so dry
[211.32 - 215.68] because um you well here's the problem
[213.88 - 217.44] too with the smoke this the smoke
[215.68 - 220.08] inhalation that people are dealing with
[217.44 - 222.60] right now even if you're like miles away
[220.08 - 224.88] from it you live miles away from it but
[222.60 - 226.96] it's in the air because it's a lot of
[224.88 - 229.12] stuff there's there's fire retardant in
[226.96 - 232.00] the air that they're dropping down it's
[229.12 - 234.08] a dust like a dust particle like almost
[232.00 - 235.76] like an aerosol that's floating around
[234.08 - 237.36] people are going to be breathing that in
[235.76 - 239.44] so if you're exposed and you're out of
[237.36 - 242.88] your house and so forth one thing you
[239.44 - 245.04] can do is you take a towel like this and
[242.88 - 247.56] I've said this before with other fires
[245.04 - 250.32] over the years but you take a towel okay
[247.56 - 252.56] and you moisten it so this is really
[250.32 - 256.24] important right here you moisten it
[252.56 - 261.60] right here I'm squeezing out the water
[256.24 - 264.48] okay just like that all right and you
[261.60 - 266.12] breathe through the towel a moist towel
[264.48 - 267.88] that's important you can you can
[266.12 - 271.24] actually make it as thin as you want you
[267.88 - 273.44] can double it up depending on how it it
[271.24 - 275.92] feels
[273.44 - 278.28] but you could do this too you can hold
[275.92 - 280.32] it just like this and you can put it
[278.28 - 283.12] over your face and you can breathe
[280.32 - 285.56] through it so what happens is the water
[283.12 - 288.96] is what catches a lot of the toxins a
[285.56 - 290.56] lot of that dust a lot of the ashes all
[288.96 - 292.92] the stuff that's coming off of people's
[290.56 - 294.04] wallboards all the paint That's burning
[292.92 - 296.64] on their
[294.04 - 300.36] houses um all the carpets like I said
[296.64 - 301.76] the furniture all that stuff and all the
[300.36 - 303.76] different chemicals the household
[301.76 - 306.20] cleaners they're all burning up in
[303.76 - 307.92] people's houses all the aerosol cans all
[306.20 - 311.16] the spray bottles of cleaners and so
[307.92 - 313.72] forth all the oil containers in people's
[311.16 - 316.16] garages you know gasoline in people's
[313.72 - 317.96] garages and and and all that so all the
[316.16 - 320.68] stuff is in the air plus what they're
[317.96 - 322.00] dropping on the fires like the fiery T
[320.68 - 324.96]  and everything they're dropping
[322.00 - 327.04] that all on everybody and you know and
[324.96 - 328.60] it's really tough when that that hair is
[327.04 - 331.12] really really tough if you're dealing
[328.60 - 334.60] with it now if you're in it I feel so
[331.12 - 336.28] bad for you but um so one of the things
[334.60 - 338.36] if you're moving around you get a couple
[336.28 - 341.08] of towels like that you keep them moist
[338.36 - 343.60] and damp if you're traveling through it
[341.08 - 346.04] you grab it you put it over your face
[343.60 - 347.84] like this and you breathe through it and
[346.04 - 350.44] you'll see the difference what happens
[347.84 - 352.84] is that that air is so dry because that
[350.44 - 354.72] air is so dry it's how it kind of gets
[352.84 - 357.56] you it's not just the oxygen loss in the
[354.72 - 359.96] air we're already somewhere around 19%
[357.56 - 362.28] oxygen as it is out there give give or
[359.96 - 363.52] take on what day the atmosphere and
[362.28 - 367.00] everything else on this planet and
[363.52 - 369.00] pollution and all that but oxygen is
[367.00 - 372.92] going to probably go down to
[369.00 - 376.56] 15% 14% in certain areas somewhere
[372.92 - 379.20] around there and it isn't just the
[376.56 - 380.80] oxygen loss it's going to be the
[379.20 - 383.40] particles it's all going to be the
[380.80 - 386.80] particles and what this does is it grabs
[383.40 - 389.20] the particles moist towels grab the
[386.80 - 391.44] particles and you can do it we could if
[389.20 - 393.72] you're in your house you don't have air
[391.44 - 395.40] cleaners it's coming into the house a
[393.72 - 397.36] lot you might want to do this
[395.40 - 399.04] periodically and then you change it out
[397.36 - 402.48] you rinse it out you change the water
[399.04 - 404.16] out too you do fresh water and you dump
[402.48 - 406.36] that water out you'll notice when you do
[404.16 - 407.24] it for a while the water starts to get
[406.36 - 409.68] kind of
[407.24 - 413.64] skunky and the water starts to get kind
[409.68 - 415.88] of um gets kind of murky and that murky
[413.64 - 418.04] is how much is floating in the air how
[415.88 - 419.92] much of that Ash how much of those
[418.04 - 422.28] particles are floating in the air and it
[419.92 - 423.68] gets trapped in the towel so you know
[422.28 - 425.56] and then when things come down or you
[423.68 - 428.12] get an air cleaner and you're able to
[425.56 - 430.12] you know suck some of that up in the air
[428.12 - 432.68] you know you're better off but and you
[430.12 - 433.96] don't have to have it real wet can just
[432.68 - 437.60] be
[433.96 - 440.60] damp um a lot of air escapes this isn't
[437.60 - 444.24] like a mask a lot of air escapes through
[440.60 - 449.04] a towel through a shirt okay it's not
[444.24 - 450.76] like uh a really good mask respirator on
[449.04 - 453.52] there and everything thing filters on
[450.76 - 456.48] there it's not like that and even that
[453.52 - 458.36] it Escapes in it's the moisture Factor
[456.48 - 460.80] that's missing in the air it's the
[458.36 - 462.32] moisture factor that allows it to really
[460.80 - 465.20] travel and get into the lungs and into
[462.32 - 466.72] the bloodstream so I'm just letting
[465.20 - 467.96] people know and maybe this doesn't even
[466.72 - 469.40] matter for you and you don't need to
[467.96 - 471.40] worry about this or think about this
[469.40 - 475.44] you're nowhere near any of this
[471.40 - 478.72] stuff but if you are this is a great
[475.44 - 481.32] technique it's a very stable technique I
[478.72 - 483.12] mean you don't want to go into a fire
[481.32 - 485.64] with it and expect it to help you it's
[483.12 - 487.76] not like that but it helps you if you're
[485.64 - 490.72] in your home you're dealing with some
[487.76 - 492.96] smoke that's coming through you're not
[490.72 - 494.40] leaving you can't go you you know you're
[492.96 - 496.64] just you're staying in that home you're
[494.40 - 499.44] staying in that apartment air is bad
[496.64 - 502.56] outside the whole bit you can do this or
[499.44 - 505.08] you got to go you got to go get food you
[502.56 - 507.64] got to get out of the house smoking in
[505.08 - 509.60] there and it's you know and what happens
[507.64 - 511.92] if you put your shirt or you wear one of
[509.60 - 513.80] those those masks that people wore those
[511.92 - 515.88] black masks and so forth those cloth
[513.80 - 519.32] masks and everything that people wore
[515.88 - 522.08] during the whole sea thing the
[519.32 - 525.64] dryness just doesn't stop it so those
[522.08 - 529.00] masks just don't stop it I saw like one
[525.64 - 531.20] news guy earlier today on social and the
[529.00 - 533.00] news guy had one of those masks right
[531.20 - 535.32] it's like the cloth one the one that
[533.00 - 537.36] people wore during sea and still wear it
[535.32 - 539.80] now a lot of people do and the guy was
[537.36 - 541.52] out there and you see the air and the
[539.80 - 544.32] smoke and the ashes blowing around I'm
[541.52 - 546.52] like that's not stopping anything
[544.32 - 548.68] because there's no moisture in it
[546.52 - 550.60] there's no moisture in it it's just not
[548.68 - 553.40] there so what what it really needed to
[550.60 - 556.60] do was periodically you know take a
[553.40 - 557.92] towel and just hold it over like this
[556.60 - 560.80] and there might be another way to do
[557.92 - 562.64] that too but hold it over like this and
[560.80 - 564.80] have it stuck on your face put it right
[562.64 - 566.96] to your face and leave an air opening
[564.80 - 570.88] like a little like a gap in there so you
[566.96 - 574.36] got like you know some Ro in there and
[570.88 - 577.36] you breathe and like I said that cotton
[574.36 - 579.36] that fabric with the moisture grabs on
[577.36 - 581.00] to it and if you feel like the air is
[579.36 - 583.00] really bad the Smoke's really bad you
[581.00 - 585.56] can double it up so you can do this then
[583.00 - 588.84] you know instead of having it on its
[585.56 - 590.64] thinnest like this that's its thinnest
[588.84 - 592.80] you know could be like a washcloth
[590.64 - 594.88] whatever right washcloth this is just a
[592.80 - 596.60] hand towel like a kitchen towel you can
[594.88 - 599.20] have it at its thinnest if for some
[596.60 - 601.76] reason it's really bad then you double
[599.20 - 603.92] it up make this makes a huge difference
[601.76 - 606.96] now you double it up like that okay now
[603.92 - 610.72] it's double got right two layers if it's
[606.96 - 613.60] really really bad you need to do four
[610.72 - 616.32] layers that's four layers right there
[613.60 - 617.40] boom got your hands like this put it
[616.32 - 620.60] over your
[617.40 - 623.20] face and you breathe and that moisture
[620.60 - 626.20] and those four layers acts like really
[623.20 - 628.00] strong filter and then all those ashes a
[626.20 - 631.04] lot of the toxins the chemicals the
[628.00 - 633.00] smoke all of that boom it gets caught in
[631.04 - 635.20] there so you're not getting so much into
[633.00 - 637.40] your lungs so if you can you need to
[635.20 - 639.60] move move around about you know and get
[637.40 - 641.40] someplace or get food or go here go
[639.60 - 642.72] there because it's it's going to be
[641.40 - 644.52] there for a while the Smoke's going to
[642.72 - 647.92] be there for a while it's not just going
[644.52 - 650.20] away tomorrow and it's just not it's
[647.92 - 653.72] it's actually just as bad if not getting
[650.20 - 655.16] worse tonight until tomorrow for sure
[653.72 - 657.44] and they don't have any you know none of
[655.16 - 660.16] its contained from you know from when
[657.44 - 662.12] you look into it um if you're somebody
[660.16 - 664.68] that's lost your
[662.12 - 667.08] home you know my heart pours out to you
[664.68 - 670.20] truly because it's just devastating
[667.08 - 673.24] everything about it so um but once again
[670.20 - 675.36] like I said you know you can do
[673.24 - 678.36] something like this it's a great tip
[675.36 - 680.08] great tip now there's this packet I
[678.36 - 682.08] don't know if you've had this before
[680.08 - 684.44] it's a medical medium tool book right
[682.08 - 687.20] here okay environmental disaster air
[684.44 - 689.52] quality tools all right including some
[687.20 - 693.28] air cleaners that are the best ones so
[689.52 - 695.52] the best air cleaners other tools too
[693.28 - 698.12] supplementation you know for after the
[695.52 - 700.60] fact as well you get some plays you're
[698.12 - 703.16] able or things start coming down got to
[700.60 - 704.52] build your immune system back up you
[703.16 - 705.92] know after getting everything because
[704.52 - 707.32] when it goes into the lungs and it goes
[705.92 - 708.76] into the bloodstream what happens with
[707.32 - 711.52] chronic illness when people have chronic
[708.76 - 713.96] illness and they're struggling it could
[711.52 - 717.16] be a trigger all those toxins all those
[713.96 - 719.72] poisons floating around Metals so the
[717.16 - 721.28] hmds is in this packet right here and
[719.72 - 724.44] you guys already do the
[721.28 - 725.52] hmds a lot of you guys do anyway a lot
[724.44 - 727.60] of the people in the medical mem
[725.52 - 731.16] Community do the
[727.60 - 732.48] hmds and so the reason why the hmds is
[731.16 - 735.68] really good because you're capturing
[732.48 - 738.16] metals that are going into the lungs and
[735.68 - 739.20] into the bloodstream and quickly into
[738.16 - 743.04] the
[739.20 - 744.92] liver and you're capturing those metals
[743.04 - 746.76] because that's what it is you know all
[744.92 - 749.64] these homes are burning all these
[746.76 - 754.52] buildings are burning churches are built
[749.64 - 756.68] burning um uh buildings are burning all

[843.12 - 850.32] how can that help it
[846.00 - 852.44] helps it helps greatly if you have
[850.32 - 856.12] experience with
[852.44 - 859.64] fires um at all in your life in some way
[856.12 - 862.40] some shape some form maybe smoke from a
[859.64 - 864.64] wildfire out there in the past or you
[862.40 - 865.56] know some type of forest fire or some
[864.64 - 868.04] other
[865.56 - 871.12] situation maybe a neighbor Burns you
[868.04 - 873.32] know a fire pit every day or you know a
[871.12 - 875.76] garbage pit a lot of neighbors they just
[873.32 - 877.44] burn garbage in different places they're
[875.76 - 880.04] not even burning wood they're burning
[877.44 - 882.20] like treated wood and garbage and all
[880.04 - 883.72] kinds of scraps of things and house
[882.20 - 885.08] trash and everything and you're dealing
[883.72 - 888.68] with something like that but you can't
[885.08 - 893.00] do anything about it this helps more
[888.68 - 894.60] than people know more than people know
[893.00 - 896.84] and so what happens you'll notice if you
[894.60 - 900.20] use it a couple times and even if it's
[896.84 - 901.56] like a half an hour to you're dealing
[900.20 - 903.92] with something where you have to open
[901.56 - 905.56] the doors in the house open the windows
[903.92 - 907.40] for some reason you open the doors to
[905.56 - 910.12] let a pet out or something like that and
[907.40 - 912.28] then the smoke just Barrels in and you
[910.12 - 914.32] shut the door and you don't have a good
[912.28 - 916.80] air cleaner or air cleaning
[914.32 - 918.72] system and um and now you're just
[916.80 - 920.36] feeling like it's just getting to you
[918.72 - 922.68] and it makes your chest heavy and if
[920.36 - 925.60] you're somebody with chronic illness
[922.68 - 927.72] it's really hard really really hard it
[925.60 - 930.64] can be a trigger I talk about smoke as
[927.72 - 933.04] being a trigger in the medical books so
[930.64 - 935.44] I have over the years talked about that
[933.04 - 938.24] it is a trigger it's nothing to fear but
[935.44 - 940.36] it is a trigger and so protecting your
[938.24 - 943.72] immune system taking care of
[940.36 - 947.44] yourself um all of that counts all of
[943.72 - 950.56] that's important that's why this is not
[947.44 - 952.44] just for you know not just for the
[950.56 - 954.76] problem in the Moment Like good air
[952.44 - 956.12] cleaners and then the hand towel the
[954.76 - 957.76] moist hand towel it's also
[956.12 - 959.52] supplementation building up your immune
[957.76 - 961.88] system because that's what gets knocked
[959.52 - 965.52] down so when we're breathing in all that
[961.88 - 967.16] smoke that Rogue smoke that's just
[965.52 - 969.92] coming from all these different things
[967.16 - 972.56] burning out there it's trying on the
[969.92 - 974.36] immune system it's heavy on the immune
[972.56 - 978.20] system it's difficult on the immune
[974.36 - 981.16] system so it's important to Boom jack up
[978.20 - 984.60] that immune system make it stronger get
[981.16 - 987.68] it in a better place very important very
[984.60 - 989.80] important so keep that in mind all right
[987.68 - 992.52] all of that counts also everyone is
[989.80 - 997.12] already fighting guess what the
[992.52 - 999.68] flu and the new bugs coming so they name
[997.12 - 1002.28] flues different things like you
[999.68 - 1005.44] know like respiratory different
[1002.28 - 1008.32] respiratory names and so forth and they
[1005.44 - 1010.16] name flu differently all the time but in
[1008.32 - 1013.28] the end they're really just bad
[1010.16 - 1015.00] flu and they like to change the names
[1013.28 - 1019.16] cuz they like to make it look like it's
[1015.00 - 1021.32] not a flu they do that too where is why
[1019.16 - 1025.24] they do that by the way if you want to
[1021.32 - 1026.68] really know is because it's getting out
[1025.24 - 1028.44] there finally I've talked about it for
[1026.68 - 1032.32] years and I've even talked about it
[1028.44 - 1036.20] medical medium books and stuff it's flu
[1032.32 - 1038.48] don't just exist they're not out there
[1036.20 - 1042.00] because they happen just to be out there
[1038.48 - 1045.68] they're let out of the gate every single
[1042.00 - 1048.68] year twice a year they let let a new one
[1045.68 - 1050.24] out they like to rename them they rename
[1048.68 - 1052.20] them because it makes it look like
[1050.24 - 1053.64] they're not letting them out you know
[1052.20 - 1056.52] there's that whole game that's played
[1053.64 - 1058.04] too when it comes down to bugs but right
[1056.52 - 1061.08] now with everybody that's dealing with
[1058.04 - 1064.52] flu and they're dealing with respiratory
[1061.08 - 1065.64] bugs andc they're dealing with that too
[1064.52 - 1068.48] it's important to keep your immune
[1065.64 - 1070.16] system strong especially with smoke and
[1068.48 - 1072.20] this Smoke's this smoke is going to
[1070.16 - 1073.56] travel all around the country different
[1072.20 - 1075.28] wind currents are going to take it the
[1073.56 - 1076.52] jet stream stream is going to take it
[1075.28 - 1078.36] it's going to be just floating around
[1076.52 - 1080.36] everywhere including all the fire fire
[1078.36 - 1082.24] retardant so it's important to have
[1080.36 - 1084.04] options here here you got the seven top
[1082.24 - 1086.00] supplements that are critical make sure
[1084.04 - 1087.40] you download this make sure you the
[1086.00 - 1089.76] links in the bio links in the
[1087.40 - 1094.60] description it's really handy and good
[1089.76 - 1097.48] to have it just is um Le lemon honey
[1094.60 - 1099.04] ginger water great for the immune system
[1097.48 - 1101.00] cucumber juice because you want
[1099.04 - 1103.00] hydration on a different level to get
[1101.00 - 1105.24] poisons and toxins out of the
[1103.00 - 1108.96] bloodstream so straight cucumber juice
[1105.24 - 1112.52] is a great great option there um let's
[1108.96 - 1114.64] see what else so many other things too
[1112.52 - 1117.16] heavy metal detox smoothie grab the
[1114.64 - 1120.84] metals cuz the metals are in the
[1117.16 - 1122.00] air heavily in the air so a lot of
[1120.84 - 1125.08] people are going to be dealing with
[1122.00 - 1127.72] burning and melting aluminum vaporizing
[1125.08 - 1131.92] in the air so that's that's really
[1127.72 - 1131.92] tricky all on its own
[1133.32 - 1137.72] um extractor smoothie that's an option
[1136.24 - 1140.72] right there another
[1137.72 - 1140.72] tool

[1173.76 - 1177.92] one with this kind of smoke with what's
[1176.24 - 1180.24] happening out there that's in this
[1177.92 - 1182.52] pamphlet too this is

[1182.52 - 1187.00] letting you know there it is links in
[1185.00 - 1190.36] the bio link is in the
[1187.00 - 1192.40] description what do you have to
[1190.36 - 1195.56] lose very
[1192.40 - 1198.16] important there is a Chemtrails
[1195.56 - 1201.12] exposure very important too here's what
[1198.16 - 1202.76] happens right got all the smoke out
[1201.12 - 1206.32] there
[1202.76 - 1210.28] okay homes houses mansions are
[1206.32 - 1212.40] burning from small houses to mansions to
[1210.28 - 1215.84] schools everything's just burning up
[1212.40 - 1216.80] right now so what happens is then all of
[1215.84 - 1219.88] a
[1216.80 - 1222.04] sudden higher powers on the planet take
[1219.88 - 1222.96] advantage of these situations and they
[1222.04 - 1227.24] end up
[1222.96 - 1230.84] directing Sea Trail planes in the
[1227.24 - 1231.88] direction and the dropping that too salt
[1230.84 - 1234.96] in the
[1231.88 - 1238.04] wound that's how it's
[1234.96 - 1239.68] done but that's that's the process so
[1238.04 - 1241.76] not only is this happening you got all
[1239.68 - 1244.92] the smoke and all these toxins in the
[1241.76 - 1247.88] air but then all of a sudden it's like
[1244.92 - 1249.32] yep send the Sea Trail planes send them
[1247.88 - 1252.32] on
[1249.32 - 1253.44] over dropping out that too it's not like
[1252.32 - 1256.76] they
[1253.44 - 1260.84] stop it's not like they stop there isn't
[1256.76 - 1262.44] some like magic wand to wave and be like
[1260.84 - 1264.52] okay well we already have this problem
[1262.44 - 1265.56] here now with all these fires and all
[1264.52 - 1268.64] this bad
[1265.56 - 1271.80] smoke children with asthma are
[1268.64 - 1274.56] struggling people are suffering from it
[1271.80 - 1278.16] but the so why don't you just stop the
[1274.56 - 1281.72] sea trails in this area nope doesn't
[1278.16 - 1284.04] work like that but that's how evil works
[1281.72 - 1285.48] it's how Darkness works it's like you
[1284.04 - 1287.92] got all the smoke and all the stuff
[1285.48 - 1290.76] happening and no higher power on the
[1287.92 - 1292.48] planet goes all right let's dial down
[1290.76 - 1295.32] all the Sea Trail
[1292.48 - 1298.36] planes they have enough trouble so let's
[1295.32 - 1300.28] get rid of those 1,400 planes that are
[1298.36 - 1302.28] going to fly over just in the next
[1300.28 - 1304.72] couple of days and drop chemicals out of
[1302.28 - 1306.16] them let's just I'm not talking about
[1304.72 - 1307.88] fire retardants coming out of
[1306.16 - 1309.96] helicopters I'm talking about planes
[1307.88 - 1311.64] with sea Trails so let's just stop that
[1309.96 - 1314.24] but they don't so those are still
[1311.64 - 1316.92] dumping they're just higher above all
[1314.24 - 1318.12] that smoke those are dumping their crap
[1316.92 - 1320.88] and then you got the evildoers on the
[1318.12 - 1324.80] planet that releasing the next bug
[1320.88 - 1328.16] respiratory bug which they already have
[1324.80 - 1330.44] it's already on its
[1328.16 - 1332.92] way next few months people are going to
[1330.44 - 1335.36] be coughing their guts out so it's
[1332.92 - 1337.56] important to protect the immune system
[1335.36 - 1338.36] let's just be straightforward on that
[1337.56 - 1340.80] really
[1338.36 - 1343.24] important so nobody's stopping the next
[1340.80 - 1347.16] bug they're releasing nobody's stopping
[1343.24 - 1349.24] the sea Trails just because their smoke
[1347.16 - 1351.92] they still keep all that in
[1349.24 - 1353.20] all that's happening and the smoke and
[1351.92 - 1356.92] the
[1353.20 - 1359.84] blaze yeah plus other stuff too and
[1356.92 - 1363.36] that's how it's done so you want to
[1359.84 - 1367.44] protect yourself so in this pamphlet you
[1363.36 - 1369.40] got the Sea Trail exposure shot it is
[1367.44 - 1372.72] valuable it is worth
[1369.40 - 1374.96] it very worth it really
[1372.72 - 1377.80] powerful got the pesticide herbicide and
[1374.96 - 1379.04] fungicide um exposure shot there nothing
[1377.80 - 1382.28] better than these shot shots for this
[1379.04 - 1384.00] kind of stuff different healing foods to
[1382.28 - 1385.40] focus on while the smoke is happening
[1384.00 - 1388.52] because here's what here's here's how it
[1385.40 - 1390.68] works okay unless you're just you're
[1388.52 - 1393.24] just trying to survive and you're eating
[1390.68 - 1394.96] whatever you have to eat nothing wrong
[1393.24 - 1396.64] with that if you're trying to survive
[1394.96 - 1398.00] and you're just you're in a bad place
[1396.64 - 1399.60] and you're figuring how to survive in
[1398.00 - 1402.28] that smoke and everything and you're
[1399.60 - 1405.92] eating what you just need to eat totally
[1402.28 - 1408.68] respect that totally understand okay of
[1405.92 - 1411.84] course but there are some powerful Foods
[1408.68 - 1414.44] you can eat to help get rid of toxins
[1411.84 - 1416.40] faster that you're inhaling inhalence
[1414.44 - 1417.68] that you're getting in your lungs so
[1416.40 - 1419.88] that's
[1417.68 - 1422.16] important and then we got the towel
[1419.88 - 1424.32] right here if you have to go outside
[1422.16 - 1426.32] when air quality is poor such as walking
[1424.32 - 1428.96] to your car or grocery store or
[1426.32 - 1431.56] traveling to your workspace this simple
[1428.96 - 1434.24] tip can help traff and reduce inhalation
[1431.56 - 1437.68] of smoke and some of the toxins in the
[1434.24 - 1440.40] dust and smoke in the air and that's it
[1437.68 - 1442.56] place a CLE clean cloth under the faucet
[1440.40 - 1445.44] or in a bowl right here of water so the
[1442.56 - 1448.12] entire cloth is wet ring excess water
[1445.44 - 1450.88] out like I did of the cloth so it is
[1448.12 - 1454.16] damp but not dripping with water keep
[1450.88 - 1457.00] that in mind damp but not dripping with
[1454.16 - 1459.76] water use both hands to pick up the damp
[1457.00 - 1461.84] clo cloth leaving some space between
[1459.76 - 1464.28] your hands so you can place it over your
[1461.84 - 1467.28] nose and mouth and breathe through the
[1464.28 - 1468.56] damp cloth and like I said if you're
[1467.28 - 1469.72] you're trying to go somewhere you're
[1468.56 - 1471.68] going to the grocery store you're
[1469.72 - 1473.68] traveling to a
[1471.68 - 1475.64] workplace if you're in your house and
[1473.68 - 1478.00] the house is filling up but you got
[1475.64 - 1479.12] nowhere to go and you just have to live
[1478.00 - 1480.80] with it that's what you're telling
[1479.12 - 1483.08] yourself because of a
[1480.80 - 1484.72] situation you don't have an option or
[1483.08 - 1486.84] opportunity really to go anywhere the
[1484.72 - 1490.24] house is Smokey inside you can totally
[1486.84 - 1492.80] do this it is a
[1490.24 - 1494.40] Savor and then air filtration
[1492.80 - 1496.40] recommendations in here too so that's
[1494.40 - 1498.80] just some of the things right there in
[1496.40 - 1501.12] the environmental disaster air quality
[1498.80 - 1504.04] tools guess how much this
[1501.12 - 1506.96] cost it's free costs
[1504.04 - 1509.48] nothing you don't have to get onto a
[1506.96 - 1512.20] membership on my
[1509.48 - 1514.20] website or social media Pages or

[1615.32 - 1618.76] really big help if that's you know if
[1617.56 - 1623.28] that's what you need to do
[1618.76 - 1626.64] do okay but yeah like it's it's
[1623.28 - 1630.28] really it's a demonic World in so many
[1626.64 - 1631.68] ways it really is because how did those
[1630.28 - 1635.12] fires
[1631.68 - 1636.76] start it's a whole another discussion
[1635.12 - 1637.64] and like I said no one's cutting off the
[1636.76 - 1640.68] sea
[1637.64 - 1642.68] Trails over the fires nobody's cutting
[1640.68 - 1646.84] those off they just let those pour out
[1642.68 - 1648.64] of jets and planes whatever and um I
[1646.84 - 1650.44] know one stopping the next bug they let
[1648.64 - 1653.08] out of the gate they manufacture and let
[1650.44 - 1654.24] out of the gate so yeah it's a difficult
[1653.08 - 1656.12] world and if you're somebody with
[1654.24 - 1659.16] chronic illness you got to protect your
[1656.12 - 1661.56] immune system or at least start maybe
[1659.16 - 1664.32] something simple do celery
[1661.56 - 1666.84] juice do some celery juice that's it
[1664.32 - 1669.96] don't add anything in it straight celery
[1666.84 - 1671.92] juice start with 2 oz if you need to
[1669.96 - 1674.80] work yourself up to 8 ounces work
[1671.92 - 1677.32] yourself up to 16 oz if you really like
[1674.80 - 1681.08] it feels good doing it work yourself up
[1677.32 - 1684.16] to 32 bounces once a day and build up
[1681.08 - 1685.72] your immune system clean up your liver
[1684.16 - 1689.76] pull that stuff
[1685.72 - 1693.08] out pull all that toxin all that
[1689.76 - 1695.12] crap pull it out of the body at least
[1693.08 - 1699.12] capture it while it's going in and flush
[1695.12 - 1701.80] out the liver do some lemon water too
[1699.12 - 1704.88] that's another thing
[1701.80 - 1707.64] right you know Spirit of
[1704.88 - 1709.68] compassion you know what's incredible
[1707.64 - 1711.24] about Spirit of compassion is lemon
[1709.68 - 1713.88] water was just like lemonade it was
[1711.24 - 1717.56] refreshing put it in water add a little
[1713.88 - 1720.72] sugar add a little honey
[1717.56 - 1722.68] right that's what you do but to flush
[1720.72 - 1725.40] the liver Spirit of compassion was like
[1722.68 - 1727.84] well no you use this tool to flush the
[1725.40 - 1729.96] liver you use this tool to flush the
[1727.84 - 1732.32] bloodstream first thing in the morning
[1729.96 - 1733.84] that's what I love about medical meme
[1732.32 - 1737.88] information
[1733.84 - 1739.88] it's really amazing so cut a lemon in
[1737.88 - 1743.08] half
[1739.88 - 1745.48] squeeze it so what I would do if I was
[1743.08 - 1747.44] in all that smoke and it was out there
[1745.48 - 1749.88] and I had a live in it for a couple
[1747.44 - 1752.32] weeks or a couple days or a month and
[1749.88 - 1754.56] it's in the air
[1752.32 - 1756.60] periodically I would be doing you know
[1754.56 - 1758.04] lemon water every single morning staying
[1756.60 - 1759.92] hydrated but you don't have to stay
[1758.04 - 1761.56] crazy hydrated you don't have to be like
[1759.92 - 1762.36] drinking tons of water you don't have to
[1761.56 - 1765.36] do
[1762.36 - 1766.88] that yeah you don't have to go and do
[1765.36 - 1768.68] that that's not doesn't mean that's
[1766.88 - 1770.76] going to be helpful
[1768.68 - 1774.16] but stay hydrated in the sense where
[1770.76 - 1779.20] instead of a cup of coffee only in the
[1774.16 - 1781.60] morning you're doing 16 o 32 o of lemon
[1779.20 - 1783.44] water where it's a glass of water and
[1781.60 - 1784.92] you squeeze a half a lemon in there and
[1783.44 - 1788.48] that's what you do and you get that
[1784.92 - 1791.40] liver flush you get that body flush you
[1788.48 - 1793.72] flush those toxins out especially if
[1791.40 - 1796.36] you're breathing in all that
[1793.72 - 1800.60] metal that's the people don't understand
[1796.36 - 1803.68] is outdoor Furniture is
[1800.60 - 1806.40] melting all getting vaporized in the
[1803.68 - 1811.12] air all the different Metals getting
[1806.40 - 1817.44] vaporized in the air it's it's
[1811.12 - 1821.28] crazy um I have information coming soon
[1817.44 - 1826.80] okay and there's a question right there
[1821.28 - 1829.56] from Cynthia why does God and His angels
[1826.80 - 1834.84] allow this evil
[1829.56 - 1839.24] here I have information about that very
[1834.84 - 1842.84] thing that very question coming really

[1859.96 - 1865.32] intense stuff those kinds of questions
[1862.76 - 1868.20] are never answered down here for a
[1865.32 - 1870.96] reason I really believe that but Spirit
[1868.20 - 1873.44] of compassion has answered them and have
[1870.96 - 1878.60] answered has answered that
[1873.44 - 1879.96] question and it is a brain Exploder it
[1878.60 - 1883.92] is a mind
[1879.96 - 1886.24] blower and I have written down all of s
[1883.92 - 1890.12] so's information about that
[1886.24 - 1893.72] question in a
[1890.12 - 1894.76] book and we are trying to release it as

[1901.52 - 1906.40] that question you will know like I said
[1904.24 - 1908.64] it's not going to be for faint
[1906.40 - 1912.24] ears faint
[1908.64 - 1914.72] eyes when you read answers to those
[1912.24 - 1917.12] kinds of questions because that question
