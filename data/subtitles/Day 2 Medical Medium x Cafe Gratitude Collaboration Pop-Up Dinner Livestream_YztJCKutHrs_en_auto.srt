and the heavy detox

48
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,840

seen changes in my life would you like

53
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,040
to talk about some of those changes

54
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:52,119
maybe some of the symptoms and

55
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:55,280
conditions that you've healed so far

56
00:01:52,119 --> 00:01:58,439
well I used to break out with acne with

57
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,479
blemishes and I was living with that for

58
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:01,680
the past 15 years

59
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,360
and I couldn't get rid of it I thought

60
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,520
it was the coffee I thought it was the

61
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,759
foods I was eating and the celery juice

62
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:10,239
within a week I'm not kidding people

63
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:11,840
were looking at me your face is all

64
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,400
glowing and I wasn't even and I wasn't

65
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,080
even wearing makeup walking into the

66
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,519
office and people would be like what do

67
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:19,360
you you people thought I was a lot

68
00:02:16,519 --> 00:02:22,480
younger than my age so I'm so grateful

69
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:25,480
because I did see the change in my skin

70
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:29,080
and I felt healthier and on top of that

71
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:30,920
no more coffee and when you drink coffee

72
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,920
if you don't take coffee for a day or

73
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:35,440
two you start to feel the headaches no

74
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:37,640
more headaches and I don't even crave it

75
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,000
anymore I don't even want to go to the I

76
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,959
don't even want to mention the name the

77
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,760
s store anymore but it really I don't

78
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:47,200
even crave the coffee anymore and also I

79
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:50,120
noticed that when I started to drink the

80
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,840
heavy detox smoothie my fatigue was gone

81
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,720
and it was something that I was living

82
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,840
with for the past couple of years now

83
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:59,000
and it got worse in the middle of the

84
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:01,720
day I would be sleepy and I took the

85
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,760
detox smooth and I started to really see

86
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:07,040
the changes I'm not fatigued anymore I

87
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:09,080
have so much energy and I there are

88
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,080
times it's like 1:00 in the morning I am

89
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:13,760
I don't even want to go to bed because

90
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:16,000
of all of the drinks that I've changed

91
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,760
the foods that I have started to eat

92
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,319
that I've changed has really helped my

93
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:23,480
energy level wow that's incredible do

94
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:25,440

honestly at a really dark point in my

139
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,960
life and had gone to so many different

140
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:09,160

00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:04,520
about this collaboration that you are so

164
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:06,160
excited for the food is amazing I just

165
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,919
made an Instagram about it because to

166
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,880
come out here and to not have to cook

167
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:13,000
and many of us even for me for work I

168
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,400
have to go meet clients sometimes and

169
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,199
not eat because I know there's going to

170
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:19,199
be something hidden in the food I'll

171
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,400
have intestinal upset from it or

172
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,720
whatever it may be to come here and not

173
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:26,160
have to cook a meal when usually you're

174
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:28,280
cooking three meals for yourself a day

175
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,520
is just amazing and then to be around

176
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:32,639
such beautiful souls I saw one of your

177
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:35,080
interviews yesterday with the gorgeous

178
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:38,440
couple that was so sweet and touching

179
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:40,599
and it's like people don't always get

180
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:42,440
we're different you know we have to eat

181
00:06:40,599 --> 00:06:44,960
differently our lifestyles are different

182
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:47,680
to be around people who understand that

183
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,880
is just so nice yeah it's so beautiful

184
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,440
the medical medium Community is so great

185
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:54,080
did you come with anyone this evening or

186
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,879
did you travel alone no last time I went

187
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,759
to the book signing my I dragged my twin

188
00:06:55,879 --> 00:07:00,160
and my mom along but this time I came

189
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,960
alone but I don't know it's very special

190
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,160
to me because I probably never could

191
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:05,960
have done something like this alone in

192
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:09,560
the past and so to do it on my own is

193
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:11,280
kind of celebration of me so you're

194
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,319
healthy enough to travel to be here with

195
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,639

fly from again to get PA here in

322
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:10,800
Sacramento so not too far but yes still

323
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:12,959
it's still a jetty and you have to be

324
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,720
well enough to to Trel you got to pack

325
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:16,800
all your adrenal snacks and you still

326
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,800
have to drink your water and you still

327
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,240
have to do everything you do when you're

328
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:23,600
at home yes yes what are you most

329
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:26,440
excited about with this event tonight

330
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:28,320
the food meeting Anthony and talking

331
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:30,880
with everybody else it's super hard to

332
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,120
find um restaurants that we can just sit

333
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,399
down and just eat and not worry about

334
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:35,160
what we're eating and knowing that it's

335
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:36,959
all safe we don't have a lot of that

336
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:39,399
especially up in my

337
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:41,079
area and with Cafe Gratitude medical

338
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:43,160
medium do you think that having these

339
00:12:41,079 --> 00:12:45,160
menus on the meal for people to on the

340
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:46,440
menu for people to enjoy will make their

341
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:49,440
healing Journey easier and more

342
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:52,320
enjoyable absolutely a lot of us cannot

343
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,880
go out to eat at all so we're making all

344
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,920
of our meals we're prepping and as

345
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:58,199
everyone knows it's like sometimes hours

346
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,399
and days of prepping um and so just it's

347
00:12:58,199 --> 00:13:01,800
a sense of freedom yeah is what it is

348
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:03,680
you know when you get sick and you're

349
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,120
trying to heal you don't go out to

350
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,920
restaurants and some of this is kind of

351
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,800
just a way to feel free for the night

352
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,560
and not worry knowing that it's safe

353
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:14,800
right because Anthony's made this all

354
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:17,800
possible so yeah which is incredible

355
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,320

about your healing Journey with

425
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,360
everything that you've gone through and

426
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:46,399
now to be able to travel to the United

427
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:48,240
States it's incredible I've actually

428
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:50,120
been reflecting on that a little bit

429
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,079
like on the flight over here it would

430
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:54,880
have been impossible if you would asked

431
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:56,040
me years ago and even just growing up

432
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,079
and going through all that I went

433
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:59,920
through with my health being completely

434
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:02,519
bedbound and having to turn down just

435
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:04,079
the simplest of plans like literally

436
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:06,120
just going out with friends I'd have to

437
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:08,319
turn down plans I'd feel guilty I'd feel

438
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:11,800
shame i' just all of this stuff growing

439
00:16:08,319 --> 00:16:13,600
up and to actually be flying here now

440
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:16,759
and not turning that down being able to

441
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:18,880
jump on a plane and get here and feel

442
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:21,360
amazing and feel healthy and feel

443
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,959
vibrant and have energy not be crashing

444
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,680
in the middle of the day not have brain

445
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:26,880
fog not have aches and pains and tingles

446
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:29,600
and numbness and all the rest of it

447
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:33,120
crazy gut issues which that

448
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:35,680
like information has really just changed

449
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:38,279
my life in such a pivotal way the

450
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:40,959
bloating the cramping the the gastric

451
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:42,519
pains and everything is gone wow it's

452
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:44,160
just incredible I was following your

453
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:46,160
Instagram by the way and I saw that you

454
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,519
had some tips for traveling and I think

455
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,160
it might be nice to share some of those

456
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:51,160
tips on how you stay on the protocol

457
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:52,880
whilst you're traveling cuz it seems it

458
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:55,240
seems kind of hard and overwhelming at

459
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:58,120
times I think especially with a longer

460
00:16:55,240 --> 00:17:00,560
flight it's so important for me to get

461
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:02,160
lemon water in so I will be at the

462
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:04,000
airport and I've made so many friends

463
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,120
this way because people will ask what

464
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,160
are you doing you're like squeezing

465
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:09,839
lemons over there I will go through

466
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:11,880
customs and get like some spring water

467
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:14,039

476
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:33,000
love bringing like things like bananas

onto the flight they're just really

478
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,440
simple and easy um and then on my flight

479
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,840
which was really lucky they do serve

480
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:42,919
fruit platters so I really love that

00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:44,880
option as well but those are just some

482
00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:46,360

Community yeah it's honestly mindblowing

496
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:16,559
to me to be here and to come have come

497
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:18,400
this far over the years I don't really

498
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:21,480
have words to describe it it honestly

499
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:23,480
feels like a distant memory or a dream

500
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:25,640
it doesn't even feel real to think of

501
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:28,200
what I went through and but at the same

502
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:29,799
time when I think back it's like like

503
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,400
what Anthony that's that Soul's gold

504
00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:35,039
that you collect along the way and that

505
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:37,280
wisdom that you collect it it means a

506
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:39,520
lot as you go through that struggle of

507
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:41,600
chronic illness it's not all for nothing

508
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,600
when you get to the other side yeah it's

509
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:46,559
like it never happened in a way it's

510
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:48,679
like you can't even connect with it on

511
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:51,000
the way as if you were experiencing like

512
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:54,400
that but the wisdom and everything the

513
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:57,679
knowledge and the experience you gain is

514
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:59,400
more than words can describe do you feel

515
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:01,960
like when you're on the other side you

516
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,240
have a appreciation in a different way

517
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:06,480
for all the things that you were now

518
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:08,520
able to do yeah and more of an

519
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:11,400
understanding and compassion as well I

520
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:14,240
mean people it's really unfortunate to

521
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:16,840
see the state of the world kind of

522
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,679
getting sicker and sicker I'm seeing

523
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,960
family and friends and people around me

524
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:21,919
start to come down with their first

525
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:24,400
symptoms and go on the doctor shopping

526
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:26,919
journey and going doctor to doctor and

527
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,919
you know I'm speaking with them and

528
00:19:26,919 --> 00:19:29,960
because of what I've been through I can

529
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:32,480
really connect to what they're

530
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:34,559
struggling with and it doesn't seem like

531
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,840
like they know that people out there

532
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:37,960
have been through what they've been

533
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:40,000
through like I went through it so young

534
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:42,080
and so I know I know the feeling and I

535
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,760
can really relate to them and their

536
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:46,919
experiences and be that kind of

537
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:48,840
compassionate shoulder for them um but

538
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:51,520
the gratitude that I feel being on the

539
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:53,200
other side of the chronic illness that

540
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:55,600
I've experienced throughout my life and

541
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,679
just the emotional battles and the

be worried about your health or your

589
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,679
healing going backwards it's supportive

590
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,520
for all of that exactly do you think

591
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:45,240
that Cafe Gratitude having these uh menu

592
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:47,320
options from medical medium on their

593
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:48,679
menu continuing forward will help other

594
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:50,440
people with their healing Journey make

595
00:21:48,679 --> 00:21:52,720
it kind of easier and more enjoyable for

596
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:55,279
them I think so I think so it's really

597
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:57,320
convenient to have a place to go and

598
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:59,679
pick up meals ready to go and have it

599
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:02,320
made for you I know a lot of people can

600
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:04,640
relate on the healing Journey having to

601
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,679
really make all of the things yourself

602
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,679
and so coming here and just enjoying

603
00:22:06,679 --> 00:22:10,400
this every once in a while and you know

604
00:22:08,679 --> 00:22:12,360
it being oil free as well is really

605
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,679
supportive for people with really severe

606
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:17,440
chronic health problems that are trying

607
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:18,720
to avoid that higher sort of fat load um

608
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,679
I think it's really supportive and

609
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,960
really incredible and it's awesome to

610
00:22:20,679 --> 00:22:25,640

time to talk to people even though I

810
00:33:15,799 --> 00:33:19,679
think it'd be very difficult I think we

811
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:21,880
would both agree to top the Canyon from

812
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:23,600
last time of 10 hours of sitting and

813
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:25,519
talking with people with amazing food

814
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:29,840
but I think tonight will be just as

815
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:32,559

00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:34,240

helded with medical medium information

846
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:44,599
start with you uh yeah I was I was a

847
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:47,919
total mess to start with um I mean it

848
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:52,399
all began with uh I was symptomatic with

849
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:54,639
regards to uh sinus sinuses issues uh I

850
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:57,280
had um you know science infections

851
00:34:54,639 --> 00:35:01,040
periodically throughout the years up

852
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:03,760
until 2011 when it it really got it got

853
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:08,119
really you know worse and um I was on a

854
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:09,760
psycho biotics I I then decided to I I

855
00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:13,160
suffered some side effects from that I

856
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:16,599
decided to to play soccer just uh you

857
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:20,040
know just I guess men's you know uh

858
00:35:16,599 --> 00:35:21,960
local soccer division around town and uh

859
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:24,640
I sustained a concussion from that so I

860
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:28,079
was a total mess from that I was on a

861
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:31,359
chair daily for about 9 years easily 9

862
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:33,960
years not able to do much so my biggest

863
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:36,680
symptoms I would say are neurological uh

864
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:40,320
issues um all kinds of other stuff like

865
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:42,320
I said sinuses they they persisted and

866
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:45,240
uh and most of that has has healed for

867
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:47,280
the most part the B of is behind me but

868
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:49,000
um there's still some work to do so I'm

869
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:51,040
just excited about that finish line I

870
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,680
could see it now that I you know

871
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:55,599
surpassed so much and uh I've been

872
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:57,480

uh this gets me a little emotional so um

954
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:44,440
anybody that's um struggling with um

955
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:48,079
chronic

956
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:51,800
illness um the medical medium

957
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:55,000
information has answers and people can

958
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:56,800
heal and you can do it pretty easily um

959
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:00,640
maybe some people more easily than

960
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:01,880
others but I had profound um effects

961
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:04,240
even within the first week of

962
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:06,720
implementing um celery juice and amongst

963
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:09,359
a couple of other things so it's just

964
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:11,079
it's profound um I would encourage

965
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:13,200
anyone that has anyone in their family

966
00:39:11,079 --> 00:39:16,319
or themselves that are struggling with

967
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:18,359
chronic illness or symptoms um that's

968
00:39:16,319 --> 00:39:21,560
making their life difficult to check

969
00:39:18,359 --> 00:39:23,240
this information out that's incredible

970
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:25,240
thank you for sharing that I know I know

971
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:26,760
it can be quite emotional would you mind

972
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:28,240
sharing some of the symptoms and

973
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:30,359
conditions that you hailed from using

974
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:32,880
medical medium information if you feel

975
00:39:30,359 --> 00:39:35,440
comfortable absolutely um thank you and

976
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:37,760
so I had a very long list of just small

977
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:39,760
nagging symptoms so some of maybe not

978
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:42,160
not so small as others but one of them

979
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:44,920
was um I was having terrible indigestion

980
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:47,319
and bloating and um difficulty even

981
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:50,000
though I was eating um pretty healthy

982
00:39:47,319 --> 00:39:51,839
food and I was living a fairly healthy

983
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,119
lifestyle I was still I was just never

984
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:56,839
able to get over these um digestion

985
00:39:54,119 --> 00:40:00,040
issues and uh I know this sounds

986
00:39:56,839 --> 00:40:03,640
miraculous than it was I was able to

987
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:05,760
heal uh make significant um progress

988
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:07,440
with my digestion just within a week of

989
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:10,040
celery juice and then making a couple

990
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:13,160
changes to my diet it was profound and

991
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:14,960
fast and it was like just I mean if I

992
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:17,480
probably sat down and looked at every

993
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:19,839
you know researched every little nagging

994
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:23,079
symptom I had I I I had probably over 50

995
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:26,960
and maybe maybe more might have been 75

996
00:40:23,079 --> 00:40:28,920
and um many of them are gone or um but

997
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:30,760
if I get get too far off track some of

998
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:35,079
them start coming back and then right

999
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:38,240
back I go to the information and uh I'm

1000
00:40:35,079 --> 00:40:41,079

1005
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:52,560

Health struggles struggles that you had

prior to the medical medium information

1008
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:59,400

00:40:56,599 --> 00:41:01,200
I'm I'm a mom my my kids ever since they

1013
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:13,480

00:41:20,359 --> 00:41:26,280
um how much I could

1019
00:41:23,319 --> 00:41:28,000

1021
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,520
hard on me and to not be able to go to

00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,680
social events and go to things and

1023
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:37,480
people just didn't understand and um so

1024

1025
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:41,920

to have a restaurant like Cafe Gratitude

1037
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:09,040
offering something like this this is

1038
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:11,240
unheard of U in most restaurants and and

1039
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:12,960
it's available here and it's such a

1040
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:16,079
smashing success that hopefully other

1041
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:17,480
restaurants will see uh and people chefs

1042
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:19,839

1043
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:22,160
benefit of offering something like this

1044
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:24,319

1049
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:34,640
Cafe Gratitude um if they would be

1050
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:37,880
willing to sell franchises

1051
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:40,720
yeah that's not a bad

1052
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:42,720

00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:45,480
including the medical medium menu

1054
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:46,800

1056
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:51,599

2981
02:11:18,280 --> 02:11:22,400

2990
02:11:45,360 --> 02:11:51,000

something that's what makes it different

3362
03:00:16,120 --> 03:00:18,920

03:00:17,720 --> 03:00:20,640
lot of things and I know there's a lot

3364
03:00:18,920 --> 03:00:23,720
of talk out there about food and

3365
03:00:20,640 --> 03:00:26,880
chemicals and things and you know and

3366
03:00:23,720 --> 03:00:28,520
and pesticides and but people don't

3367
03:00:26,880 --> 03:00:30,920
realize in the health movement yet

3368
03:00:28,520 --> 03:00:32,520
they're they're not there as advanced

3369
03:00:30,920 --> 03:00:34,640
the medical medium information is so

3370
03:00:32,520 --> 03:00:36,760
Advanced they don't know about the

3371
03:00:34,640 --> 03:00:40,319

03:01:13,200 --> 03:01:16,720
know you have to look out for all of it

3388
03:01:14,840 --> 03:01:18,920
and the dishes here and this is what's

3389
03:01:16,720 --> 03:01:20,800
incredible about Cafe grish at itude is

3390
03:01:18,920 --> 03:01:23,040
that they've taken the medical medium

3391
03:01:20,800 --> 03:01:26,960
dishes and recipes and they've elevated

3392
03:01:23,040 --> 03:01:29,359
it and they it's unbelievable how pure

3393
03:01:26,960 --> 03:01:31,000
how clean how you don't have to worry

3394
03:01:29,359 --> 03:01:32,760
you don't have to say what's in here you

3395
03:01:31,000 --> 03:01:35,080
don't have to say wait what is this or

3396
03:01:32,760 --> 03:01:37,359
what is that it's that it's that

3397
03:01:35,080 --> 03:01:39,279
wonderful it really is oh it it really

3398
03:01:37,359 --> 03:01:41,760
is and I've heard you talk about how the

3399
03:01:39,279 --> 03:01:43,880
chronically ill are not respected can

3400
03:01:41,760 --> 03:01:45,640
you talk a little bit more about that I

3401
03:01:43,880 --> 03:01:48,960
mean the chronically ill have been swept

3402
03:01:45,640 --> 03:01:51,319
under the carpet for ages it they just

3403
03:01:48,960 --> 03:01:52,720
have been um they've been ignored

3404
03:01:51,319 --> 03:01:54,239
they've been told they're lazy they've

3405
03:01:52,720 --> 03:01:57,800
been told that they're they're not

3406
03:01:54,239 --> 03:01:59,840
really sick and even though the industry

3407
03:01:57,800 --> 03:02:02,520
is changing in the health world where

3408
03:01:59,840 --> 03:02:05,040
they're recognizing um conditions and

3409
03:02:02,520 --> 03:02:06,840
they're recognizing symptoms more and

3410
03:02:05,040 --> 03:02:08,439
you know there's some good people good

3411
03:02:06,840 --> 03:02:11,720
professionals working in the health

3412
03:02:08,439 --> 03:02:14,239
field it's still not enough The Chronic

3413
03:02:11,720 --> 03:02:16,120
chronically ill are still disrespected

3414
03:02:14,239 --> 03:02:18,160
they're still not listened to enough

3415
03:02:16,120 --> 03:02:20,880
they're still not understood they're

3416
03:02:18,160 --> 03:02:22,960
seen as a bank roll too uh that's

3417
03:02:20,880 --> 03:02:25,319
another thing in the health industry now

3418
03:02:22,960 --> 03:02:27,399
so you know it's it's it's all about you

3419
03:02:25,319 --> 03:02:28,920
know likes and clicks and everything and

3420
03:02:27,399 --> 03:02:31,279
I understand that's how the industry

3421
03:02:28,920 --> 03:02:33,479
works but the chronically ill you know

3422
03:02:31,279 --> 03:02:36,399
you have to look out for them you have

3423
03:02:33,479 --> 03:02:39,160
to care about them and that's not there

3424
03:02:36,399 --> 03:02:41,680
you know it's like yeah people are sick

3425
03:02:39,160 --> 03:02:44,359
they're suffering and struggling sure

3426
03:02:41,680 --> 03:02:47,239
right but we need to care and we need to

3427
03:02:44,359 --> 03:02:50,000
look out for them and really focus on

3428
03:02:47,239 --> 03:02:52,319
like what's best for them and that's

3429
03:02:50,000 --> 03:02:54,359
been my entire Mission it's about what's

3430
03:02:52,319 --> 03:02:56,800
best for the chronically ill what do

3431
03:02:54,359 --> 03:02:59,960
they really need what can really protect

3432
03:02:56,800 --> 03:03:01,920
them and and keep them safe with all the

3433
03:02:59,960 --> 03:03:04,560
different obstacles and the pitfalls out

3434
03:03:01,920 --> 03:03:06,399
there and the snares and the tiger traps

3435
03:03:04,560 --> 03:03:08,720
they're there and they're there for

3436
03:03:06,399 --> 03:03:11,800
people who are healthy enough now but

3437
03:03:08,720 --> 03:03:13,000
everybody's getting sick everybody and

3438
03:03:11,800 --> 03:03:15,160
when people think they're not going to

3439
03:03:13,000 --> 03:03:17,239
get sick how do you think we end up

3440
03:03:15,160 --> 03:03:20,760
leaving this planet we get sick

3441
03:03:17,239 --> 03:03:22,439
somewhere somehow down the line and so

3442
03:03:20,760 --> 03:03:24,279
yeah it may be a little later for

3443
03:03:22,439 --> 03:03:26,960
someone it may be a little later for

3444
03:03:24,279 --> 03:03:29,399
this person but everybody becomes

3445
03:03:26,960 --> 03:03:31,120
chronically ill at some point eventually

3446
03:03:29,399 --> 03:03:34,160
so we should respect a chronically ill

3447
03:03:31,120 --> 03:03:35,960
when we're not sick because we need to

3448
03:03:34,160 --> 03:03:38,200
understand what they're what what

3449
03:03:35,960 --> 03:03:40,399
they're doing to heal what they're doing

3450
03:03:38,200 --> 03:03:42,560
to move forward because that's precious

3451
03:03:40,399 --> 03:03:44,399
information that other people can use

3452
03:03:42,560 --> 03:03:45,920
that aren't sick now but then they run

3453
03:03:44,399 --> 03:03:48,080
across somebody in their family or a

3454
03:03:45,920 --> 03:03:50,160
friend that gets sick and they can have

3455
03:03:48,080 --> 03:03:51,359
this powerful information and and

3456
03:03:50,160 --> 03:03:53,359
actually you know spread this

3457
03:03:51,359 --> 03:03:56,200
information with the chronic ill for

3458
03:03:53,359 --> 03:03:58,680
years been called like liars and and

3459
03:03:56,200 --> 03:04:00,560
they're lazy and they're you know

3460
03:03:58,680 --> 03:04:02,920
they're not really sick and they're

3461
03:04:00,560 --> 03:04:05,080
making it up it's all in their head or

3462
03:04:02,920 --> 03:04:07,399
they're just bored or something or

3463
03:04:05,080 --> 03:04:11,760
they're just neurotic or have some kind

3464
03:04:07,399 --> 03:04:13,720
of phobia when really they got sick they

3465
03:04:11,760 --> 03:04:16,200
got real reasons There's real reasons

3466
03:04:13,720 --> 03:04:18,000
underneath there inside their body

3467
03:04:16,200 --> 03:04:20,760
that's why they're struggling and

3468
03:04:18,000 --> 03:04:22,640
anything like OCD or PTSD that comes

3469
03:04:20,760 --> 03:04:24,399
later for a lot of people who are sick

3470
03:04:22,640 --> 03:04:27,479
it's from being sick too long it's not

3471
03:04:24,399 --> 03:04:30,680
respected it's not people are not

3472
03:04:27,479 --> 03:04:32,640
appreciated they're um and that should

3473
03:04:30,680 --> 03:04:34,960
change and I think medical medium

3474
03:04:32,640 --> 03:04:37,720
information and the mission is to help

3475
03:04:34,960 --> 03:04:39,520
The Chronic leel and to change that to

3476
03:04:37,720 --> 03:04:41,399
change that narrative out there that's

3477
03:04:39,520 --> 03:04:43,960
out you know that's happening to the

3478
03:04:41,399 --> 03:04:45,520
sick people who are struggling and we

3479
03:04:43,960 --> 03:04:46,920
need to do something about it and this

3480
03:04:45,520 --> 03:04:49,560
is an incredible step right here we're

3481
03:04:46,920 --> 03:04:51,880
at Cafe GR they have the the best meals

3482
03:04:49,560 --> 03:04:54,960
they're using the medical medium

3483
03:04:51,880 --> 03:04:56,760
information they're putting the meals

3484
03:04:54,960 --> 03:04:58,960
together in a way that's never been done

3485
03:04:56,760 --> 03:05:00,399
before so it doesn't get any better yeah

3486
03:04:58,960 --> 03:05:02,439
it's incredible you're talking about the

3487
03:05:00,399 --> 03:05:04,040
medical medium information so why is it

3488
03:05:02,439 --> 03:05:05,479
that so many people are healing I've

3489
03:05:04,040 --> 03:05:07,920
talked to them tonight and I do have to

3490
03:05:05,479 --> 03:05:09,200

03:05:16,120 --> 03:05:22,920
time and I get my information from above

3497
03:05:19,439 --> 03:05:25,520

they're all working with biohacks and

3504
03:05:36,319 --> 03:05:40,319
everything but when you put those

3505
03:05:38,239 --> 03:05:42,439
biohacks to the test with somebody who's

3506
03:05:40,319 --> 03:05:45,680

03:27:02,120 --> 03:27:06,960
home I'm just so excited that

3747
03:27:04,359 --> 03:27:09,680
restaurants are adopting medical medium

3748
03:27:06,960 --> 03:27:12,640
food and it's becoming slowly more and

3749
03:27:09,680 --> 03:27:14,319
more mainstream and like cuz my dream is

3750
03:27:12,640 --> 03:27:16,239
that one day I can just leave my house

3751
03:27:14,319 --> 03:27:17,800
and buy medical medium prepared food

3752
03:27:16,239 --> 03:27:19,800
like wherever I go cuz you know it's it

3753
03:27:17,800 --> 03:27:22,880
takes a lot of time and it's a labor of

3754
03:27:19,800 --> 03:27:24,640
love but so one day I see a world where

3755
03:27:22,880 --> 03:27:26,479
you can get medical medium friendly food

3756
03:27:24,640 --> 03:27:28,239

[Applause]

4036
03:49:50,359 --> 03:49:55,640
you know I was thinking this morning

4037
03:49:54,159 --> 03:49:58,680
when I got up really

4038
03:49:55,640 --> 03:50:00,279
early and I was thinking about the earth

4039
03:49:58,680 --> 03:50:03,479
going around the

4040
03:50:00,279 --> 03:50:05,960
Sun and how you know we're all on the

4041
03:50:03,479 --> 03:50:08,359
Earth right now going around the Sun

4042
03:50:05,960 --> 03:50:11,680
okay how incredible that

4043
03:50:08,359 --> 03:50:14,960
is and then I was thinking

4044
03:50:11,680 --> 03:50:17,720
about how is it possible that we're on

4045
03:50:14,960 --> 03:50:20,560
the Forefront of time right now right

4046
03:50:17,720 --> 03:50:24,040
this is the present moment of time every

4047
03:50:20,560 --> 03:50:28,040
second that clicks forward we in it

4048
03:50:24,040 --> 03:50:28,040
together think about that a little

4049
03:50:28,479 --> 03:50:36,920
bit how many civilizations have come and

4050
03:50:32,359 --> 03:50:39,560
gone right why are we here altto

4051
03:50:36,920 --> 03:50:42,520
together doing medical medium

4052
03:50:39,560 --> 03:50:45,319
information you know healing how are we

4053
03:50:42,520 --> 03:50:47,680
all in here in this restaurant this

4054
03:50:45,319 --> 03:50:50,680
beautiful incredible restaurant together

4055
03:50:47,680 --> 03:50:52,720
right now with all the civilizations

4056
03:50:50,680 --> 03:50:56,560
that have come and

4057
03:50:52,720 --> 03:50:59,159
gone think about that one billions of

4058
03:50:56,560 --> 03:51:01,159
people have come and

4059
03:50:59,159 --> 03:51:03,640
gone

4060
03:51:01,159 --> 03:51:07,080
billions throughout the

4061
03:51:03,640 --> 03:51:08,920
years but we're here on the Forefront of

4062
03:51:07,080 --> 03:51:11,720
time right

4063
03:51:08,920 --> 03:51:13,399
now and that then leads me to something

4064
03:51:11,720 --> 03:51:15,080
Spirit of compassion has always told me

4065
03:51:13,399 --> 03:51:18,880
is

4066
03:51:15,080 --> 03:51:21,159
we come back if you're okay with that

4067
03:51:18,880 --> 03:51:24,399
one I know some people are like no you

4068
03:51:21,159 --> 03:51:27,640
don't come back you're just you're here

4069
03:51:24,399 --> 03:51:29,120
and then you're gone and that's it I

4070
03:51:27,640 --> 03:51:32,199
actually know it's

4071
03:51:29,120 --> 03:51:35,800
different I actually know it's

4072
03:51:32,199 --> 03:51:39,120
different and the information I get is

4073
03:51:35,800 --> 03:51:42,640
we're always on that Forefront of time

4074
03:51:39,120 --> 03:51:45,159
so we're back but we're right here

4075
03:51:42,640 --> 03:51:49,359
together now is it a coincidence we're

4076
03:51:45,159 --> 03:51:52,359
all here together tonight no way no way

4077
03:51:49,359 --> 03:51:55,399
it's not possible it's

4078
03:51:52,359 --> 03:51:57,000
not and I noticed in the medical medium

4079
03:51:55,399 --> 03:51:58,680
community and I've said this before that

4080
03:51:57,000 --> 03:52:00,560
there's really old souls here okay

4081
03:51:58,680 --> 03:52:04,239
you've heard that before you've heard

4082
03:52:00,560 --> 03:52:05,479
that right maybe you saw somebody maybe

4083
03:52:04,239 --> 03:52:07,120
you saw an intuitive and they're like

4084
03:52:05,479 --> 03:52:09,680
you're an old

4085
03:52:07,120 --> 03:52:11,640
soul and people talk about that but the

4086
03:52:09,680 --> 03:52:14,159
people in this community really are old

4087
03:52:11,640 --> 03:52:17,399
souls there's a lot of reasons there's a

4088
03:52:14,159 --> 03:52:20,840
len tested for that there's reasons to

4089
03:52:17,399 --> 03:52:22,479
believe that you guys are old souls so

4090
03:52:20,840 --> 03:52:25,720
if you ever doubt it you're like I don't

4091
03:52:22,479 --> 03:52:30,159
know how old of a soul I really

4092
03:52:25,720 --> 03:52:32,640
am but you really are one of those

4093
03:52:30,159 --> 03:52:36,399
reasons to believe that you're a really

4094
03:52:32,640 --> 03:52:38,080
old soul is that you guys are brave you

4095
03:52:36,399 --> 03:52:40,880
found this information and something

4096
03:52:38,080 --> 03:52:44,880
spoke to you whether it's Angelic forces

4097
03:52:40,880 --> 03:52:48,479
Supernatural forces I hear the book just

4098
03:52:44,880 --> 03:52:50,239
landed on somebody's lap one day maybe

4099
03:52:48,479 --> 03:52:53,680
it was in a doctor's office on a coffee

4100
03:52:50,239 --> 03:52:55,960
table maybe a friend just said try this

4101
03:52:53,680 --> 03:52:57,000
maybe it was in a store somewhere but

4102
03:52:55,960 --> 03:52:59,920
there's a

4103
03:52:57,000 --> 03:53:01,960
supernatural connection to how that book

4104
03:52:59,920 --> 03:53:03,720
got to you or that information got to

4105
03:53:01,960 --> 03:53:06,439
you it's much different than anything

4106
03:53:03,720 --> 03:53:08,319
else out there in the world of Health

4107
03:53:06,439 --> 03:53:10,399
you talk to other people out there and

4108
03:53:08,319 --> 03:53:12,520
it's like yeah I saw some ad on social

4109
03:53:10,399 --> 03:53:14,560
media and I'm trying this bioh hack and

4110
03:53:12,520 --> 03:53:16,439
that's what it is but that's not how the

4111
03:53:14,560 --> 03:53:19,720
medical medium information works or the

4112
03:53:16,439 --> 03:53:21,560
people that Discover it how it works

4113
03:53:19,720 --> 03:53:24,239
it's an entirely different situation

4114
03:53:21,560 --> 03:53:25,720
when you ask people how did you find out

4115
03:53:24,239 --> 03:53:27,880
well I found out through my loved one

4116
03:53:25,720 --> 03:53:29,479
how did they find out well you know what

4117
03:53:27,880 --> 03:53:32,319
they were in a store and it spoke to

4118
03:53:29,479 --> 03:53:35,000
them and they saw it on the shelf and it

4119
03:53:32,319 --> 03:53:37,159
spoke to them it fell off the shelf

4120
03:53:35,000 --> 03:53:39,880
someone told me years

4121
03:53:37,159 --> 03:53:42,040
ago that the medical medium book fell

4122
03:53:39,880 --> 03:53:45,040
off the shelf right in front of them in

4123
03:53:42,040 --> 03:53:46,680
Barnes & Noble they were just walking

4124
03:53:45,040 --> 03:53:47,880
down the aisle they weren't even looking

4125
03:53:46,680 --> 03:53:50,080
for a health

4126
03:53:47,880 --> 03:53:51,520
book they were sick but they weren't

4127
03:53:50,080 --> 03:53:53,800
even in there doing that they were

4128
03:53:51,520 --> 03:53:56,199
cutting through the aisle and as they

4129
03:53:53,800 --> 03:53:59,000
were cutting through the book just

4130
03:53:56,199 --> 03:54:02,120
nudged itself off the shelf they watched

4131
03:53:59,000 --> 03:54:03,920
it and it landed on the ground face up

4132
03:54:02,120 --> 03:54:06,880
they picked it up and they said what is

4133
03:54:03,920 --> 03:54:06,880
this and who is

4134
03:54:11,560 --> 03:54:19,560
this they held on to it they read

4135
03:54:15,920 --> 03:54:22,000
it and they realized it saved their life

4136
03:54:19,560 --> 03:54:24,040
it saved their life and they're an old

4137
03:54:22,000 --> 03:54:26,760
soul now a lot of times I've said this

4138
03:54:24,040 --> 03:54:29,840
I'm not the oldest soul I was given this

4139
03:54:26,760 --> 03:54:31,880
gift yes you guys know about it you guys

4140
03:54:29,840 --> 03:54:33,960
know and you probably get a lot of

4141
03:54:31,880 --> 03:54:38,319
for it too you listen to the medical

4142
03:54:33,960 --> 03:54:41,640
medium you you read his

4143
03:54:38,319 --> 03:54:43,199
stuff right I never knew when I was four

4144
03:54:41,640 --> 03:54:47,760
years old that it would give a lot of

4145
03:54:43,199 --> 03:54:51,359
people but my great grandfather he

4146
03:54:47,760 --> 03:54:52,760
knew and my parents they knew they're

4147
03:54:51,359 --> 03:54:55,399
still

4148
03:54:52,760 --> 03:54:57,680
alive trying to convince my dad to go on

4149
03:54:55,399 --> 03:55:00,520
to a podcast someday with me and I

4150
03:54:57,680 --> 03:55:04,399
actually think he's going to do

4151
03:55:00,520 --> 03:55:04,399
it and and my

4152
03:55:05,080 --> 03:55:09,080
mom

4153
03:55:06,600 --> 03:55:12,960
but there's something to be said about

4154
03:55:09,080 --> 03:55:16,560
that you know it's it's you have to have

4155
03:55:12,960 --> 03:55:20,439
a bigger Consciousness to do medical

4156
03:55:16,560 --> 03:55:23,840
medium so you have to be an older

4157
03:55:20,439 --> 03:55:27,760
Soul right you just

4158
03:55:23,840 --> 03:55:31,800
do because the information blows your

4159
03:55:27,760 --> 03:55:34,439
mind it's blown my mind right when I

4160
03:55:31,800 --> 03:55:36,720
heard the information from above my mind

4161
03:55:34,439 --> 03:55:39,199
was blown when I did the last books the

4162
03:55:36,720 --> 03:55:41,560
brain saer books it was too much almost

4163
03:55:39,199 --> 03:55:45,560
on me because I was like what every

4164
03:55:41,560 --> 03:55:45,560
sentence was like what

4165
03:55:46,640 --> 03:55:50,279
but I've always said I'm not the oldest

4166
03:55:48,080 --> 03:55:52,359
soul I just have something inside of me

4167
03:55:50,279 --> 03:55:54,319
the spirit of compassion said you'll do

4168
03:55:52,359 --> 03:56:00,520
you'll

4169
03:55:54,319 --> 03:56:03,040
do you might you might not be the oldest

4170
03:56:00,520 --> 03:56:04,720
Soul the people who will receive this

4171
03:56:03,040 --> 03:56:06,680
information are going to be old souls

4172
03:56:04,720 --> 03:56:10,600
you might not be the oldest Soul they'll

4173
03:56:06,680 --> 03:56:13,199
be thousands of years older than you for

4174
03:56:10,600 --> 03:56:15,880
sure but you got something inside of you

4175
03:56:13,199 --> 03:56:20,040
and we need that

4176
03:56:15,880 --> 03:56:20,040
you got something kind of tough about

4177
03:56:20,479 --> 03:56:25,960
you like

4178
03:56:22,800 --> 03:56:29,040
really I'm that

4179
03:56:25,960 --> 03:56:33,760
tough tough enough to hear the voice and

4180
03:56:29,040 --> 03:56:36,680
hang in there stay sane you know and and

4181
03:56:33,760 --> 03:56:39,439
through that process you know message

4182
03:56:36,680 --> 03:56:42,800
message and message but that's only a

4183
03:56:39,439 --> 03:56:48,199
part of it it's nothing without you guys

4184
03:56:42,800 --> 03:56:50,479
it's nothing it is I could be in my own

4185
03:56:48,199 --> 03:56:54,239
little room somewhere getting the

4186
03:56:50,479 --> 03:56:57,239
information from above receiving it

4187
03:56:54,239 --> 03:57:00,600
learning about it and in the end what

4188
03:56:57,239 --> 03:57:04,239
does that do if I can't get it out to

4189
03:57:00,600 --> 03:57:06,239
you guys you know I think what happens

4190
03:57:04,239 --> 03:57:08,560
when an author and I forget I'm an

4191
03:57:06,239 --> 03:57:11,520
author I actually forget because in the

4192
03:57:08,560 --> 03:57:14,479
end I'm not writing the

4193
03:57:11,520 --> 03:57:17,840
books it's coming from above it's

4194
03:57:14,479 --> 03:57:21,880
prophecies it's Advanced information so

4195
03:57:17,840 --> 03:57:24,199
really am I even an author probably not

4196
03:57:21,880 --> 03:57:27,159
but on the book it says

4197
03:57:24,199 --> 03:57:29,800
so

4198
03:57:27,159 --> 03:57:32,319
right but if I didn't have the ability

4199
03:57:29,800 --> 03:57:34,159
to get this information out there and I

4200
03:57:32,319 --> 03:57:37,960
remember when my

4201
03:57:34,159 --> 03:57:41,120
publisher okay they were like yeah we we

4202
03:57:37,960 --> 03:57:44,199
want you we we want to help people I

4203
03:57:41,120 --> 03:57:45,920
couldn't believe it couldn't believe it

4204
03:57:44,199 --> 03:57:49,159
we want to get the message out because

4205
03:57:45,920 --> 03:57:52,199
we've never seen anything like this and

4206
03:57:49,159 --> 03:57:54,840
I was like oh my God there is a God

4207
03:57:52,199 --> 03:57:55,840
there is because I could just be sitting

4208
03:57:54,840 --> 03:58:00,000
in my

4209
03:57:55,840 --> 03:58:02,800
room right scribbling the information on

4210
03:58:00,000 --> 03:58:04,800
papers and piling them up and it never

4211
03:58:02,800 --> 03:58:08,159
going

4212
03:58:04,800 --> 03:58:11,359
anywhere so I'm only one half of it you

4213
03:58:08,159 --> 03:58:14,840
guys are the other half of it the other

4214
03:58:11,359 --> 03:58:18,239
half and you guys do the work you guys

4215
03:58:14,840 --> 03:58:21,040
do it even if you're dabbling it still

4216
03:58:18,239 --> 03:58:23,319
counts I don't want anybody to think oh

4217
03:58:21,040 --> 03:58:25,159
I'm dabbling and maybe I'm not that into

4218
03:58:23,319 --> 03:58:28,000
no you're into it and it's going to kind

4219
03:58:25,159 --> 03:58:31,080
of ebb and flow it might be like now

4220
03:58:28,000 --> 03:58:33,359
you're doing one thing and then you look

4221
03:58:31,080 --> 03:58:35,920
up in the book or you see something I've

4222
03:58:33,359 --> 03:58:37,880
said that's coming from above and you do

4223
03:58:35,920 --> 03:58:40,239
another thing and another

4224
03:58:37,880 --> 03:58:41,880
thing and I know the road is hard you

4225
03:58:40,239 --> 03:58:44,399
guys got a lot of faith you guys got a

4226
03:58:41,880 --> 03:58:46,840
lot of faith because the stuff out there

4227
03:58:44,399 --> 03:58:48,720
challenges that a lot right and so

4228
03:58:46,840 --> 03:58:52,279
you're like what do I do I heard this

4229
03:58:48,720 --> 03:58:55,720
thing out here what do I do you know aw

4230
03:58:52,279 --> 03:58:57,120
is not a science Professor no not that

4231
03:58:55,720 --> 03:58:59,680
the science professors get people

4232
03:58:57,120 --> 03:59:01,439
chronically ill better I mean how many

4233
03:58:59,680 --> 03:59:05,199
do I don't

4234
03:59:01,439 --> 03:59:07,640
know but it's it's easy to be challenged

4235
03:59:05,199 --> 03:59:09,800
and then your faith is challenged and

4236
03:59:07,640 --> 03:59:11,800
then you're like what do I do and then

4237
03:59:09,800 --> 03:59:14,159
you being an old soul you come back to

4238
03:59:11,800 --> 03:59:16,159
and say I know what I'm doing I know

4239
03:59:14,159 --> 03:59:18,800
what I need to do this is the

4240

04:01:11,880 --> 04:01:16,239
you're seeing them contemplate and

4286
04:01:14,120 --> 04:01:18,399
possibly sitting on the fence and then

4287
04:01:16,239 --> 04:01:20,680
falling off the fence on the right side

4288
04:01:18,399 --> 04:01:23,800
and then doing the things they need to

4289
04:01:20,680 --> 04:01:26,080
do the reward is bigger than a big old

4290
04:01:23,800 --> 04:01:28,960
trophy or somebody saying good job you

4291
04:01:26,080 --> 04:01:32,840

04:01:32,840 --> 04:01:37,720

light that stands in the way of the

4297
04:01:42,680 --> 04:01:47,960
darkness that the trophy that's the gold

4298
04:01:54,080 --> 04:01:59,279
medal so we're we're on this

4299
04:01:57,000 --> 04:02:01,760
rock we're on this

4300
04:01:59,279 --> 04:02:05,439
Earth it's going around the

4301
04:02:01,760 --> 04:02:09,960
sun right that's what it's

4302
04:02:05,439 --> 04:02:12,640
doing the sun is shining a light

4303
04:02:09,960 --> 04:02:16,960
energy it's hitting seeds that were

4304
04:02:12,640 --> 04:02:18,800
planted in far arms those seeds grew and

4305
04:02:16,960 --> 04:02:23,199
I said this last night this part right

4306
04:02:18,800 --> 04:02:25,159
here I said last night okay would those

4307
04:02:23,199 --> 04:02:26,800
seeds have ever thought if they can

4308
04:02:25,159 --> 04:02:29,239
think and they have a Consciousness and

4309
04:02:26,800 --> 04:02:31,040
they may have a Consciousness they may

4310
04:02:29,239 --> 04:02:33,120
I'll ask Spirit of

4311
04:02:31,040 --> 04:02:36,239
compassion be one of the questions that

4312
04:02:33,120 --> 04:02:39,080
the next thousand questions I

4313
04:02:36,239 --> 04:02:41,680
ask they have a Consciousness and

4314
04:02:39,080 --> 04:02:43,479
they're growing is it possible they're

4315
04:02:41,680 --> 04:02:44,880
growing for you tonight right now for

4316
04:02:43,479 --> 04:02:47,520
this very

4317
04:02:44,880 --> 04:02:49,920
dinner they were harvested at a farm

4318
04:02:47,520 --> 04:02:52,120
they were grown for you specifically and

4319
04:02:49,920 --> 04:02:54,279
then they're here on this plate is that

4320
04:02:52,120 --> 04:02:54,279
a

4321
04:02:56,040 --> 04:03:01,640
coincidence your body has every right to

4322
04:02:59,159 --> 04:03:03,760
heal every god-given right to heal never

4323
04:03:01,640 --> 04:03:06,520
forget that I have to say it time and

4324
04:03:03,760 --> 04:03:08,840
time again because we can easily believe

4325
04:03:06,520 --> 04:03:11,040
that we don't deserve to heal we don't

4326
04:03:08,840 --> 04:03:13,800
deserve it because the world beats us

4327
04:03:11,040 --> 04:03:16,359
down and it's very hard here on planet

4328
04:03:13,800 --> 04:03:19,560
Earth planet stress is what I call it

4329
04:03:16,359 --> 04:03:19,560
you guys heard me say that

4330
04:03:19,760 --> 04:03:26,120
before but we have the tools to keep our

4331
04:03:23,640 --> 04:03:28,479
bodies healthy recover from things that

4332
04:03:26,120 --> 04:03:31,680
have happened in the past move our

4333
04:03:28,479 --> 04:03:35,439
bodies forward we have the tools we have

4334
04:03:31,680 --> 04:03:38,960
the food counts it does it's a big piece

4335
04:03:35,439 --> 04:03:40,960
of it I love when people try to you know

4336
04:03:38,960 --> 04:03:44,120
call out on medical

4337
04:03:40,960 --> 04:03:46,239
medium and they're like he doesn't say

4338
04:03:44,120 --> 04:03:50,159
the food does anything he doesn't say

4339
04:03:46,239 --> 04:03:52,319
the food heals he's all about

4340
04:03:50,159 --> 04:03:54,439
supplements if you read the books and

4341
04:03:52,319 --> 04:03:57,120
you learn the information food is a

4342
04:03:54,439 --> 04:04:00,319
massive piece of it a massive piece of

4343
04:03:57,120 --> 04:04:01,800
it and yeah this world is so difficult

4344
04:04:00,319 --> 04:04:04,159
and there's so many exposures that we

4345
04:04:01,800 --> 04:04:08,000
need some things added to that yes we

4346
04:04:04,159 --> 04:04:08,000
need some additional pieces that are

4347
04:04:09,319 --> 04:04:17,760
critical every one of you here has not

4348
04:04:13,800 --> 04:04:20,479
like joined a club in which I close the

4349
04:04:17,760 --> 04:04:23,640
doors and then I'm teaching you the

4350
04:04:20,479 --> 04:04:27,040
information you

4351
04:04:23,640 --> 04:04:29,920
guys are some ballsy people that took it

4352
04:04:27,040 --> 04:04:31,479
upon yourself and you got into the books

4353
04:04:29,920 --> 04:04:35,000
and you saw the

4354
04:04:31,479 --> 04:04:37,080
information and you customized it for

4355
04:04:35,000 --> 04:04:39,080
yourselves that right there doesn't

4356
04:04:37,080 --> 04:04:41,880
happen in the health movement in the

4357
04:04:39,080 --> 04:04:44,279
health movement everybody needs to be

4358
04:04:41,880 --> 04:04:47,040
kind of like their hands held they need

4359
04:04:44,279 --> 04:04:49,960
to sign up to some big course they need

4360
04:04:47,040 --> 04:04:52,560
to be right doing some kind of training

4361
04:04:49,960 --> 04:04:56,159
to try to show them

4362
04:04:52,560 --> 04:04:58,359
way you guys didn't do that here talking

4363
04:04:56,159 --> 04:05:01,960
about old souls that's a big one right

4364
04:04:58,359 --> 04:05:07,040
now that one right there you guys did it

4365
04:05:01,960 --> 04:05:09,960
for yourselves you guys

4366
04:05:07,040 --> 04:05:13,720
yeah you guys didn't join the Anthony

4367
04:05:09,960 --> 04:05:16,760
William Club somewhere some membership

4368
04:05:13,720 --> 04:05:18,159
or something where you know you didn't

4369
04:05:16,760 --> 04:05:20,720
do

4370
04:05:18,159 --> 04:05:23,359
that you got the book somewhere from the

4371
04:05:20,720 --> 04:05:25,640
library you got it from Barnes & Noble

4372
04:05:23,359 --> 04:05:28,720
you got it from a bookstore in Europe

4373
04:05:25,640 --> 04:05:30,439
you got it somewhere you got it and you

4374
04:05:28,720 --> 04:05:33,239
said I'm going to do this intentions

4375
04:05:30,439 --> 04:05:35,640
that you you actually did yourself what

4376
04:05:33,239 --> 04:05:37,000
is that that's old soul stuff that's

4377
04:05:35,640 --> 04:05:40,159
what that

4378
04:05:37,000 --> 04:05:42,640
is and the other thing is which is a big

4379
04:05:40,159 --> 04:05:44,800
deal you guys are no strangers to the

4380
04:05:42,640 --> 04:05:47,640
supernatural

4381
04:05:44,800 --> 04:05:49,479
forces you guys believe in angels and if

4382
04:05:47,640 --> 04:05:51,159
you don't believe in angels that's fine

4383
04:05:49,479 --> 04:05:52,239
do you believe in light maybe you

4384
04:05:51,159 --> 04:05:55,760

Angels you talk to angels and that's a

4388
04:06:00,120 --> 04:06:04,479
big deal you know I leave telegrams

4389
04:06:02,359 --> 04:06:06,279

4390
04:06:04,479 --> 04:06:08,399

through it some of you guys are like I

4442
04:08:18,600 --> 04:08:21,960
don't care if he hears the voice I don't

4443
04:08:20,159 --> 04:08:24,479
care what he says I don't care if he's

4444
04:08:21,960 --> 04:08:26,479

sense

04:08:44,239 --> 04:08:47,720
it's

4452
04:08:45,359 --> 04:08:50,960
not almost all of medical medium

4453
04:08:47,720 --> 04:08:53,199
information isn't common sense for sure

4454
04:08:50,960 --> 04:08:55,439
it's not but it makes sense once you

4455
04:08:53,199 --> 04:08:57,199

4600
04:15:13,239 --> 04:15:16,080

here right here is that you guys have

4603
04:15:20,199 --> 04:15:25,760
purpose but you guys have what purpose

4604
04:15:22,960 --> 04:15:27,479

their mind and they think it's one

4611
04:15:44,159 --> 04:15:48,479
purpose and that's their purpose they

4612
04:15:46,920 --> 04:15:50,119
feel lost and they don't even think they

4613
04:15:48,479 --> 04:15:52,800
have a purpose because it's this one

4614
04:15:50,119 --> 04:15:55,680

right lad down on this on some of the

4647
04:17:28,439 --> 04:17:32,279
masterful work that you've done with the

4648
04:17:29,960 --> 04:17:35,159
medical medium dishes I know they're no

4649
04:17:32,279 --> 04:17:38,199
oil no nuts which is incredible all on

4650
04:17:35,159 --> 04:17:40,560
its own gluten-free soy free soy free

4651
04:17:38,199 --> 04:17:43,239
and easy on the salt exactly so tell me

4652
04:17:40,560 --> 04:17:45,439
a little bit about how like working with

4653
04:17:43,239 --> 04:17:47,080
those parameters and everything well I

4654
04:17:45,439 --> 04:17:49,319
mean it was like I said it was a great

4655
04:17:47,080 --> 04:17:51,119
opportunity to look at cooking in a new

4656
04:17:49,319 --> 04:17:53,560
way so it was and and to look for

4657
04:17:51,119 --> 04:17:55,760
alternatives to the traditional flavor

4658
04:17:53,560 --> 04:17:57,119
builders that we usually use in food um

4659
04:17:55,760 --> 04:17:58,720
as you know part of the collaboration

4660
04:17:57,119 --> 04:18:00,279
that we have here is that we assign

4661
04:17:58,720 --> 04:18:01,880
affirmation names to all of our food

4662
04:18:00,279 --> 04:18:04,760
which actually helps the healing process

4663
04:18:01,880 --> 04:18:07,119
in our opinion um and mine too yeah

4664
04:18:04,760 --> 04:18:09,560
right it is a good thing so here we have

4665
04:18:07,119 --> 04:18:11,720
imys which is our green papaya and kelp

4666
04:18:09,560 --> 04:18:14,439
noodle salad um with a coconut based

4667
04:18:11,720 --> 04:18:16,600
dressing and lots of TI spices and herbs

4668
04:18:14,439 --> 04:18:18,560
here we've got the I Am Noble for the

4669
04:18:16,600 --> 04:18:20,399
noble potato cuz it's the spicy potato

4670
04:18:18,560 --> 04:18:22,640
burrito bowl with your cheese sauce and

4671
04:18:20,399 --> 04:18:24,239
the potato is Noble for sure exactly and

4672
04:18:22,640 --> 04:18:26,319
a healing food a lot of people don't

4673
04:18:24,239 --> 04:18:27,960
know that so that's really powerful the

4674
04:18:26,319 --> 04:18:29,359
name goes perfect with it right there

4675
04:18:27,960 --> 04:18:30,680
and we've got a black beam Pico that

4676
04:18:29,359 --> 04:18:32,840
goes with that and then some water

4677
04:18:30,680 --> 04:18:34,640
sauteed kale and some great Pico deallo

4678
04:18:32,840 --> 04:18:36,199
well you got the kale that's incredible

4679
04:18:34,640 --> 04:18:38,279
to got some greens in there to sort of

4680
04:18:36,199 --> 04:18:41,600
lighten it up a bit and so this is I am

4681
04:18:38,279 --> 04:18:44,520
trustworthy which is your uh original

4682
04:18:41,600 --> 04:18:45,840
portabello and uh pepper fajita dish

4683
04:18:44,520 --> 04:18:48,119
we've dressed it up with a little bit of

4684
04:18:45,840 --> 04:18:50,040
lemon marinated red onions some

4685
04:18:48,119 --> 04:18:51,880
guacamole and some Pico de Gaya with a

4686
04:18:50,040 --> 04:18:53,800
squeeze of lime as well and we serve it

4687
04:18:51,880 --> 04:18:54,920
with the Millet tortillas which are I

4688
04:18:53,800 --> 04:18:56,840
think you're sort of famous for those

4689
04:18:54,920 --> 04:18:59,640
right and you can see it's the Perfect

4690
04:18:56,840 --> 04:19:01,640
Blend and you got the Millet tortilla

4691
04:18:59,640 --> 04:19:03,520
you can put a little bit of guacamole in

4692
04:19:01,640 --> 04:19:05,399
there you can put a little bit of the

4693
04:19:03,520 --> 04:19:07,520
onion in there you can make it the way

4694
04:19:05,399 --> 04:19:09,000
you want it that's incredible and then

4695
04:19:07,520 --> 04:19:10,880
it becomes like finger food then you

4696
04:19:09,000 --> 04:19:13,000
have in your hands you can enjoy it then

4697
04:19:10,880 --> 04:19:14,560
you could add a little bit more want

4698
04:19:13,000 --> 04:19:16,199
those little tortillas in my hand and I

4699
04:19:14,560 --> 04:19:18,319
want to put a little that because I've

4700
04:19:16,199 --> 04:19:20,319
tried guacamole in different places and

4701
04:19:18,319 --> 04:19:22,680
Cafe Gratitude guacamole is another

4702
04:19:20,319 --> 04:19:24,279
level it actually has flavor and that's

4703
04:19:22,680 --> 04:19:26,359
the key well in part of the affirmation

4704
04:19:24,279 --> 04:19:27,880
healing you can trust that everything in

4705
04:19:26,359 --> 04:19:29,279
this plate is going to be good for the

4706
04:19:27,880 --> 04:19:30,040
body right so that's why we're calling

4707
04:19:29,279 --> 04:19:31,840
it

4708
04:19:30,040 --> 04:19:33,800
trustworthy and the last one that we're

4709
04:19:31,840 --> 04:19:36,520
having as part of the menu here is the I

4710
04:19:33,800 --> 04:19:39,000
am insightful which is a jasmine rice

4711
04:19:36,520 --> 04:19:41,439
and organic jasmine rice vegetable Sushi

4712
04:19:39,000 --> 04:19:42,960
we serve it with uh pumpkin seed tofu

4713
04:19:41,439 --> 04:19:44,800
which is something that I think is a

4714
04:19:42,960 --> 04:19:47,600
really great soy alternative another

4715
04:19:44,800 --> 04:19:50,000
whole food avocado some vegetables

4716
04:19:47,600 --> 04:19:51,239
carrots cabbage and also some cucumber

4717
04:19:50,000 --> 04:19:54,080
in there as well you got the zinc and

4718
04:19:51,239 --> 04:19:56,600
the Pumpkin Seed so there's just there's

4719
04:19:54,080 --> 04:19:58,199
healing there's all kinds of different

4720
04:19:56,600 --> 04:20:00,279
aspects of these dishes that are healing

4721
04:19:58,199 --> 04:20:02,439
and I want to go to the papaya which is

4722
04:20:00,279 --> 04:20:05,239
incredible you're not using the Hawaiian

4723
04:20:02,439 --> 04:20:07,319
papaya no that is mindblowing right

4724
04:20:05,239 --> 04:20:09,119
there because you know like just if

4725
04:20:07,319 --> 04:20:11,040
somebody's going to use papaya it always

4726
04:20:09,119 --> 04:20:13,560
seems to be the Hawaiian papaya and I'm

4727
04:20:11,040 --> 04:20:16,800
like no this is incredible so you got

4728
04:20:13,560 --> 04:20:19,439
the shredded papaya and that's IM am wi

4729
04:20:16,800 --> 04:20:21,880
yes we we work with Organics pretty much

4730
04:20:19,439 --> 04:20:24,000
exclusively and I believe under the

4731
04:20:21,880 --> 04:20:26,399
organic certifications you can't have

4732
04:20:24,000 --> 04:20:27,800
the genetically modified papaya so

4733
04:20:26,399 --> 04:20:29,359
that's why we don't go with the Hawaiian

4734
04:20:27,800 --> 04:20:31,199
one unfortunately but that's just the

4735
04:20:29,359 --> 04:20:32,760
reality it's just the reality of it oh

4736
04:20:31,199 --> 04:20:34,760
we forgot the precious the uh wild

4737
04:20:32,760 --> 04:20:37,680
blueberry and cherry smoothie there it

4738
04:20:34,760 --> 04:20:39,000
is right there an mm smoothie okay and

4739
04:20:37,680 --> 04:20:40,720
that's the wild blueberry that's the

4740
04:20:39,000 --> 04:20:43,840
Cherry people are going to love the

4741
04:20:40,720 --> 04:20:46,680
flavor it's juice yeah oh it's so good

4742
04:20:43,840 --> 04:20:49,479
and so so rich but yet so light you're

4743
04:20:46,680 --> 04:20:52,560
satiated but you won't leave like we're

4744
04:20:49,479 --> 04:20:54,199
feeling real heavy and greasy and all

4745
04:20:52,560 --> 04:20:56,840
that it's just absolutely not absolutely

4746
04:20:54,199 --> 04:20:58,399
not just healing food people can fill up

4747
04:20:56,840 --> 04:21:00,080
get satiated and then they can do

4748
04:20:58,399 --> 04:21:01,319
whatever they need to do their workouts

4749
04:21:00,080 --> 04:21:02,920
they can go to the beach whatever they

4750
04:21:01,319 --> 04:21:06,040
got to do live their life but they got

4751
04:21:02,920 --> 04:21:07,760
the best food purest forms they don't

4752
04:21:06,040 --> 04:21:09,399
have the uh the nuts and the oils and

4753
04:21:07,760 --> 04:21:10,960
I'm saying that like nuts are terrible

4754
04:21:09,399 --> 04:21:13,800
or anything like that it's just that

4755
04:21:10,960 --> 04:21:16,080
these are breaking those rules and it's

4756
04:21:13,800 --> 04:21:18,319
like the no oil the no soy the no gluten

4757
04:21:16,080 --> 04:21:20,199
the no nuts and then the easy on the

4758
04:21:18,319 --> 04:21:21,880
salt I mean it's mind-blowing well the

4759
04:21:20,199 --> 04:21:23,560
more the more guidelines that we can

4760
04:21:21,880 --> 04:21:25,359
follow here the the more people we can

4761
04:21:23,560 --> 04:21:27,119
bring into this way of eating right so

4762
04:21:25,359 --> 04:21:29,520
if somebody wants to eat healthier but

4763
04:21:27,119 --> 04:21:30,760
can't eat nuts then half of the menu you

4764
04:21:29,520 --> 04:21:32,239
know is not going to be available in

4765
04:21:30,760 --> 04:21:33,800
this case they can have the whole thing

4766
04:21:32,239 --> 04:21:36,640
there's no nothing that they don't have

4767
04:21:33,800 --> 04:21:39,159
to uh not have you know I challenge

4768
04:21:36,640 --> 04:21:41,000
people to come in and try it I really do

4769
04:21:39,159 --> 04:21:43,760

flavors I want to see them give it a

4772
04:21:46,080 --> 04:21:50,840
shot try it see what they like about it

4773
04:21:48,800 --> 04:21:52,600

to kind of test a few things out and I

4964
04:29:31,680 --> 04:29:34,800
didn't get the sushi thinking that it

4965
04:29:33,000 --> 04:29:36,199
wasn't going to be good or having had

4966
04:29:34,800 --> 04:29:38,159
sushi a really long time ago just

4967
04:29:36,199 --> 04:29:39,720
conventional and been liking it and

4968
04:29:38,159 --> 04:29:41,279
tonight was a really really big surprise

4969
04:29:39,720 --> 04:29:42,840
I think it was one of my favorites but

4970
04:29:41,279 --> 04:29:44,439
to pick one would be be very very

4971
04:29:42,840 --> 04:29:45,600
difficult they were all really amazing

4972
04:29:44,439 --> 04:29:47,080
that's so interesting a lot of people

4973
04:29:45,600 --> 04:29:48,840
are saying that about the sushi that

4974
04:29:47,080 --> 04:29:49,920
they were just so surprised and that a

4975
04:29:48,840 --> 04:29:52,479
lot of people are saying it's one of

4976
04:29:49,920 --> 04:29:54,600
their favorites absolutely yeah I mean I

4977
04:29:52,479 --> 04:29:55,680
guess the the chef that made it really

4978
04:29:54,600 --> 04:29:57,760
really worked hard and I wouldn't be

4979
04:29:55,680 --> 04:29:59,520
surprised if had some input on how to

4980
04:29:57,760 --> 04:30:01,399
put things together really well and it

4981
04:29:59,520 --> 04:30:03,359

4982
04:30:01,399 --> 04:30:05,520
your favorite part of the evening my

4983
04:30:03,359 --> 04:30:06,960
favorite part I think uh I came in here

4984
04:30:05,520 --> 04:30:09,080
just being really excited to talk to a

4985
04:30:06,960 --> 04:30:10,800
lot of people and last time I think it

4986
04:30:09,080 --> 04:30:12,840
was really Soul healing for me and the

4987
04:30:10,800 --> 04:30:15,040
same thing happened tonight just feel

4988
04:30:12,840 --> 04:30:17,239
much much lighter being amongst I think

4989
04:30:15,040 --> 04:30:19,000
people who think the same yeah it's

4990
04:30:17,239 --> 04:30:21,000
beautiful what was your experience like

4991
04:30:19,000 --> 04:30:22,600
with the life loss with the light blast

4992
04:30:21,000 --> 04:30:24,720
I think for me it takes a little while

4993
04:30:22,600 --> 04:30:26,239
until I feel the effects but immediately

4994
04:30:24,720 --> 04:30:29,000
it's kind of like just a feeling of

4995
04:30:26,239 --> 04:30:31,479
lightness and more of a presence kind of

4996
04:30:29,000 --> 04:30:34,760
like um maybe dis Association and like

4997
04:30:31,479 --> 04:30:37,439
brain fog being a little bit better you

4998
04:30:34,760 --> 04:30:39,600
know and continuing your medical medium

4999
04:30:37,439 --> 04:30:41,000
Journey uh would you like to share with

5000
04:30:39,600 --> 04:30:43,199
anyone out there one piece of

5001
04:30:41,000 --> 04:30:45,399
information that has really been a game

5002
04:30:43,199 --> 04:30:47,119
changer in your healing Journey

5003
04:30:45,399 --> 04:30:49,399
absolutely so I know for example you

5004
04:30:47,119 --> 04:30:51,800
can't always do something perfectly you

5005
04:30:49,399 --> 04:30:53,319
know you might continue eating meat or

5006
04:30:51,800 --> 04:30:55,119
you know minimizing how many eggs you

5007
04:30:53,319 --> 04:30:57,239
eat but one thing that I was doing which

5008
04:30:55,119 --> 04:30:58,600
was holding me back with strap and this

5009
04:30:57,239 --> 04:31:01,040
was something that was brought up to me

5010
04:30:58,600 --> 04:31:02,920
by a woman that um I talked to in

5011
04:31:01,040 --> 04:31:05,479
Calabasas not Calabasas sorry at the

5012
04:31:02,920 --> 04:31:07,760
first event in June in Clover City was

5013
04:31:05,479 --> 04:31:10,000
that eating rice is not really good for

5014
04:31:07,760 --> 04:31:11,760
strep because you might not realize but

5015
04:31:10,000 --> 04:31:13,760
it creates an environment in your body

5016
04:31:11,760 --> 04:31:15,080
that that really allow strep to prosper

5017
04:31:13,760 --> 04:31:16,760
and I hadn't really realized that and

5018
04:31:15,080 --> 04:31:18,720
it's interesting it sometimes it can

5019
04:31:16,760 --> 04:31:19,920
take a long time for you to either find

5020
04:31:18,720 --> 04:31:22,359
the information in a book or from

5021
04:31:19,920 --> 04:31:23,760
someone and realize the full scope of it

5022
04:31:22,359 --> 04:31:25,439
you might be doing celeres you might be

5023
04:31:23,760 --> 04:31:26,720
doing the heavy metal detox but there

5024
04:31:25,439 --> 04:31:28,960
might be a few things that you're still

5025
04:31:26,720 --> 04:31:30,399
doing wrong that can Propel you further

5026
04:31:28,960 --> 04:31:32,239
when you stop doing them I think that

5027
04:31:30,399 --> 04:31:33,960
would be a big piece of advice yes

5028
04:31:32,239 --> 04:31:36,080
that's so interesting that like you're

5029
04:31:33,960 --> 04:31:37,720
saying there's some things that are

5030
04:31:36,080 --> 04:31:39,560
maybe like hidden causes or things you

5031
04:31:37,720 --> 04:31:41,159
don't think of that are causing your

5032
04:31:39,560 --> 04:31:43,119
maybe like setbacks or your healing

5033
04:31:41,159 --> 04:31:45,080
journey to progress forward a little bit

5034
04:31:43,119 --> 04:31:46,399
more so yeah thank you for sharing that

5035
04:31:45,080 --> 04:31:48,880
information I'm going to keep that in

5036
04:31:46,399 --> 04:31:50,800
mind as well absolutely yes well I'm so

5037
04:31:48,880 --> 04:31:52,239
glad that you came out this evening did

5038
04:31:50,800 --> 04:31:54,359
you enjoy meeting all those new people

5039
04:31:52,239 --> 04:31:55,960
at the table absolutely and we connected

5040
04:31:54,359 --> 04:31:57,399
and hopefully when another event happens

5041
04:31:55,960 --> 04:31:59,359
here in California or potentially

5042
04:31:57,399 --> 04:32:01,119
somewhere else that will come together

5043
04:31:59,359 --> 04:32:02,399
or even you know come together

5044
04:32:01,119 --> 04:32:04,319
separately I mean what was really

5045
04:32:02,399 --> 04:32:07,000
interesting was it seemed like we were

5046
04:32:04,319 --> 04:32:09,439
seated very intentionally that there

5047
04:32:07,000 --> 04:32:11,600
were two women at my table who found out

5048
04:32:09,439 --> 04:32:13,040
that they live blocks apart you know so

5049
04:32:11,600 --> 04:32:15,159
I was telling them it'd be amazing for

5050
04:32:13,040 --> 04:32:16,640
them to have a dinner together oh wow so

5051
04:32:15,159 --> 04:32:19,279
you're saying they live blocks apart

5052
04:32:16,640 --> 04:32:20,920
blocks apart yeah and they connected

5053
04:32:19,279 --> 04:32:23,520
this evening not knowing that like their

5054
04:32:20,920 --> 04:32:25,199
blocks apart being medical medium

5055
04:32:23,520 --> 04:32:26,960
followers and part of the community and

5056
04:32:25,199 --> 04:32:28,359
they got to connect here in Los Angeles

5057
04:32:26,960 --> 04:32:31,000
absolutely just happened to be sitting

5058
04:32:28,359 --> 04:32:32,920
at the same table wow that's incredible

5059
04:32:31,000 --> 04:32:36,439
do you think that like Cafe Gratitude

5060
04:32:32,920 --> 04:32:38,520
having this uh medical medium menu uh as

5061
04:32:36,439 --> 04:32:41,000
part of their own menu will help people

5062
04:32:38,520 --> 04:32:44,000
heal and make it a bit easier and more

5063
04:32:41,000 --> 04:32:46,479
more enjoyable for people to enjoy

5064
04:32:44,000 --> 04:32:48,279
absolutely because you know this is a

5065
04:32:46,479 --> 04:32:50,319
huge thing for a restaurant to have such

5066
04:32:48,279 --> 04:32:51,439
a clean menu and this might be a way

5067
04:32:50,319 --> 04:32:53,479
that somebody might find out about

5068
04:32:51,439 --> 04:32:55,720
medical medium information see the menu

5069
04:32:53,479 --> 04:32:58,319
begin to heal be a great step into the

5070
04:32:55,720 --> 04:32:59,600
whole you know world of medical medium

5071
04:32:58,319 --> 04:33:00,840
wow I never thought of it like that but

5072
04:32:59,600 --> 04:33:03,439
that's so true they might see it on the

5073
04:33:00,840 --> 04:33:05,320
menu be like what is this and another

5074
04:33:03,439 --> 04:33:07,439
way of people finding out about how to

5075
04:33:05,320 --> 04:33:09,639
heal right yeah and realizing that

5076
04:33:07,439 --> 04:33:11,520
Health isn't necessarily pills it's not

5077
04:33:09,639 --> 04:33:12,520
necessarily you know hot yoga or

5078
04:33:11,520 --> 04:33:14,359

blast oh oh gosh I could I could feel

5130
04:35:05,119 --> 04:35:08,439

5131
04:35:06,439 --> 04:35:10,520
just see it every time he said light and

5132
04:35:08,439 --> 04:35:12,160
that didn't happen last time um you know

5133
04:35:10,520 --> 04:35:14,799

it so and your experience with the light

5135
04:35:14,799 --> 04:35:20,160
Blast how was that good peaceful usually

5136
04:35:17,680 --> 04:35:23,000
takes a couple days to kick in but it's

5137
04:35:20,160 --> 04:35:26,199
always nice and if anything besides

5138
04:35:23,000 --> 04:35:29,480

5140
04:35:29,480 --> 04:35:32,920

light light light to go through that

5143
04:35:34,639 --> 04:35:39,680
process yeah was it different from the

5144
04:35:37,561 --> 04:35:42,320
other times you've seen him in person

5145
04:35:39,680 --> 04:35:44,279
with the light Blast for me it was um at

5146
04:35:42,320 --> 04:35:46,639
the last event I didn't really see any

5147
04:35:44,279 --> 04:35:48,600
light except for one moment but this

5148
04:35:46,639 --> 04:35:51,199
time it was the entire time I felt it

5149
04:35:48,600 --> 04:35:53,279
you know what about

5150
04:35:51,199 --> 04:35:54,639

first light blast or have you been

5152
04:35:54,639 --> 04:35:59,199
multiple times third so how was this

5153
04:35:57,639 --> 04:36:00,600
different from the other light blast

5154
04:35:59,199 --> 04:36:02,840
that you've

5155
04:36:00,600 --> 04:36:05,680

5156
04:36:02,840 --> 04:36:06,680
process and visualizing it but you set

5157
04:36:05,680 --> 04:36:09,240

5158
04:36:06,680 --> 04:36:12,320
intention God's magic Works wherever it
