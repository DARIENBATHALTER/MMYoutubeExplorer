1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,259
out the brain and short circuiting

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:06,240
you know it's crazy when I think about

3
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:07,980
things you guys

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,019
brain saver I'm going to read out of it

5
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:12,540
I'm also going to make a detox bitters

6
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:16,139
juice which is really cool helping to

7
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:19,680
detox various chemicals out of the brain

8
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:21,600
which is needed now you don't believe me

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,939
you don't believe people have chemicals

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,699
inside their brain and everything else

11
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:29,699
check this out a friend of mine was at a

12
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:34,620
college football game recently

13
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:37,739
and there was like 80 000 students

14
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:41,160
in the stands right out there watching

15
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:43,079
it and he was telling me that he thought

16
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,460
about it and so he asked me some

17
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:47,940
questions he said

18
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:49,440
how many students are on Adderall

19
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,420
how many

20
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,760
and so I was like oh well let me just

21
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:55,680
kind of try to figure that out talk to

22
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,180
Spirit of compassion a little bit

23
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,660
it's a lot

24
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:04,820
huge amounts so bottles of Adderall and

25
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:09,360
purses bottles of Adderall in people's

26
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:11,600
cars bottles in their pockets pills in

27
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,340
their pockets pills and their purses

28
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:17,159
pills in their wallets

29
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:20,040
pills in their bloodstream

30
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:22,979
you got 80 000 students

31
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:26,100
almost all of them not all of them

32
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:28,920
almost all of them are on Adderall

33
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:31,740
and why and then their parents are

34
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:34,740
taking them to the doctor's office right

35
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,960
and so you got all those doctors think

36
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:38,340
about that

37
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:41,040
thousands and thousands of doctors

38
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:44,520
because all those 80 000 students aren't

39
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,619
all going to the same doctor so you have

40
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:49,079
thousands of doctors

41
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:51,060
handing out Adderall

42
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:53,880
so the students

43
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:55,680
can actually have some clarity to get

44
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,600
out of their focus and concentration

45
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,420
problems

46
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:03,420
and at the same time those thousands and

47
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:06,060
thousands of doctors don't know why the

48
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:08,819
students are having

49
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:12,840
focus and concentration problems think

50
00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:16,620
about how insane this all is this is

51
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:20,040
think about that it's utterly insane

52
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:23,340
so and that's just one thing right and

53
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:25,860
then out of the 80 000 students watching

54
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:28,739
a big football game

55
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:30,959
how many students are on antidepressants

56
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:33,060
and anti-anti-anxiety meds and that's

57
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,640
something SOC told me so well you're

58
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:39,200
forgetting about aw you're forgetting

59
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:42,420
about the anti-anxiety meds and the

60
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,940
antidepressants so you got out of the 80

61
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:47,160
000 students watching a football game

62
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:50,640
the majority

63
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:53,879
think about this so SOC told me the

64
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:56,760
majority of the 80 000 students watching

65
00:02:53,879 --> 00:03:01,140
the football game are also on an

66
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:02,819
antidepressant or an anti-anxiety Med

67
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:06,120
think about that one

68
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:07,800
at the same time the majority are on

69
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,739
Adderall

70
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:15,019
at that same time at the same time not

71
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:19,680
one doctor out of tens of thousands of

72
00:03:15,019 --> 00:03:23,519
Physicians knows why

73
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:26,879
all those students can't focus and

74
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:29,459
concentrate without drugs

75
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,360
now you think science research has it

76
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:32,700
all

77
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,680
bagged up you think they got it all down

78
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:38,459
you think they have all the answers

79
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:40,560
signs of research doesn't know why

80
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:42,480
those 80 000 students can't focus and

81
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,480
concentrate and need drugs to focus in

82
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:49,140
concentrate all those doctors who are

83
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:51,120
so-called under Sciences whatever don't

84
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:53,519
know why the kids have anxiety

85
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,440
depression can't focus can't concentrate

86
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,480
ADHD and everything else and they have

87
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,459
to be on Adderall and antidepressants

88
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:02,040
and anti-anxiety meds

89
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:03,780
so you have medical research and science

90
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,580
has no idea

91
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:08,159
you got all the doctors that have no

92
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:10,560
idea and all the kids

93
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:13,439
are going to the doctors because Mom and

94
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,180
Dad are bringing all the students to the

95
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:17,160
doctors

96
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:18,959
thinking that science and research has

97
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,699
it all sewed up

98
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,560
and so they're bringing their children

99
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:24,180
into the doctor's office and the doctors

100
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,500
is just like oh you can't focus and

101
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,419
concentrate you can't do your school

102
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,100
studies you can't keep up with your

103
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:30,600
schedule here's another bottle of

104
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,520
Adderall

105
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,560
oh you're depressed you got anxiety

106
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:37,380
here's another bottle of anti-anxiety

107
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,300
meds when you think about it it's

108
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:40,979
totally insane

109
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:44,160
just think about that

110
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:46,139
so what none of them know

111
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,940
none of the moms and dads none of the

112
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:50,100
doctors none of the research and science

113
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:53,040
people behind it all they don't know

114
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:55,680
what causes all those problems they have

115
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:59,580
no idea so think about

116
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:04,199
what an insane world we live in

117
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:07,440
now how come I have to be this messenger

118
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:09,840
getting information from above

119
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,580
that's way ahead of science and research

120
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,800
it's way ahead of the doctors handing

121
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:17,280
out all the Adderall how come I have to

122
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:20,780
be this Messenger to why

123
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:25,199
those 80 000 students

124
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:28,199
in an arena like that watching a game

125
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:32,160
are loaded with drugs getting filled up

126
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:34,680
with drugs now it is possible that

127
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:37,620
medical research decides never wants to

128
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:39,180
know the answer because that's a lot of

129
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:41,039
drugs so when you think about how much

130
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:42,300
Adderall was in their purses their

131
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:45,539
pockets

132
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:47,940
their wallets their cars in their

133
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:49,259
bloodstream how many antidepressants and

134
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:51,240
anti-anxiety meds were in their

135
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:53,460
bloodstream their purses their pockets

136
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:57,419
their wallets their cars

137
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:59,820
and and their apartments on campus

138
00:05:57,419 --> 00:06:01,800
how many of those drugs

139
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:04,139
are in there and if you added all those

140
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:06,780
up with the majority of 80 000 students

141
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:09,660
if you added all those drugs up

142
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:13,259
it would make a mountain a small

143
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:16,620
mountain of prescription bottles

144
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:19,560
not to mention the black market drugs

145
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:21,780
too for focusing concentration right

146
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:25,919
it would pile up

147
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:28,800
a massive pile of drugs

148
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:31,199
that all the students are on

149
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,360
but yet medical research and science nor

150
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:36,479
do the doctors nor do the parents have

151
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:39,300
any idea why their students their

152
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:42,000
children and their patients have to be

153
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:43,620
on all those drugs to get by and focused

154
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,759
and concentrate and try to do school

155
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:46,800
studies

156
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:48,900
and whatever and keep up with their

157
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,539
partying or whatever that they're doing

158
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:52,680
and be able to do that it's incredible

159
00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:55,740
right

160
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:58,500
when medical research and science has no

161
00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:00,419
idea about

162
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,860
there are answers

163
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:03,660
of why

164
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:05,280
people are dealing with that that's just

165
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:07,440
something to think about when I think

166
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,639
about it and might be something to think

167
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,620
about when you guys think about because

168
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,840
oh my God anyway I'm going to be reading

169
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:15,600
some killer information something called

170
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:19,139
melting down in the brain say rebook I'm

171
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:21,960
also making a recipe just so you know

172
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:23,639
making the brain detox bitters recipe

173
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:26,039
right there

174
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:28,020
which is really fun because

175
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:30,419
I couldn't wait to make this one you see

176
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:32,699
some apples right there you see some

177
00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:34,979
spinach right here look at this really

178
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:36,240
nice you see some dandelions these are

179

wild

180
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:42,120
actually dandelions

181
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:43,800

185
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:55,199
really good have you guys tried it from

186
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:58,080
the brain saver protocols book

187
00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:01,259
it's really cool I'm excited Deanna says

188
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:03,840
I have seen ads on TV for lawyers asking

189
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:06,300
if you have kids with autism and did you

190
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,800
feed them baby food and they say that

191
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:09,360
those foods have been found to be

192
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,680
contaminated with heavy metals

193
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,900
interesting

194
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:15,240
well Deanna

195
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:16,259
science research nor any lawyers or

196
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:20,099
anything

197
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:22,560
knows or knew that toxic heavy metals

198
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:26,099
are responsible for kids with autism

199
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:29,099
having autism or ADHD that is original

200
00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:30,060
medical medium information going all the

201
00:08:29,099 --> 00:08:33,060
way back

202
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:34,500
so that's poaching with no science

203
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:36,539
behind it

204
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:38,339
so that's really interesting lawyers

205
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:40,380
aren't going to be finding any people to

206
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:41,940
find any science behind that at all it's

207
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:44,399
not going to even happen that they can

208
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:46,560
link that and that was only considered

209
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,480
being a possible link to it through

210
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,519
medical medium information

211
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,640
that I've been teaching for years not to

212
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:56,880
mention the published material

213
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:58,440
so this broke that out to the world

214
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,620
millions and millions and millions of

215
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:04,800
copies of the cause true cause of ADHD

216
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:08,399
and autism including lectures and other

217
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:10,200
work that I've done prior and during so

218
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,240
that's the only reason why you can even

219
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,040
see that notice go out there and add

220
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,440
running saying that Metals could be

221
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:18,540
linked to autism because it's all

222
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:20,399
original medical medium information and

223
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:24,620
those are poachers

224
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,620
and that's whatever so

225
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,519
here's the sad part with the lawyers or

226
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,100
whoever are poachers involved in that ad

227
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:34,740
or whatever that campaign is

228
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:36,300
they will not cite back where they got

229
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,920
the original medical medium information

230
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,420
so

231
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,060
the kids

232
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:43,860
and the babies can get the toxic heavy

233
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:45,600
metals out

234
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:48,240
of their brain

235
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,459
those kids will never get the medals out

236
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:53,880
of their brain ever

237
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:56,640
to help with autism or ADHD unless it

238
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:59,959
was cited to a source where there are

239
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:02,399
actual books information

240
00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:04,560
and so many people who have gotten the

241
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,480
metals out of the brain and recovered

242
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,760
from so many different conditions so

243
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,100
that's what's really sad about that and

244
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:13,440
that's the disgusting part of what you

245
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:15,720
saw in that ad they're not saying

246
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,700
but we have answers to help all those

247
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:19,140
kids that somehow got contaminated with

248
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:21,120
toxic heavy metals because the answers

249
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:22,980
came originally from medical medium so

250
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,080
let's figure out how to get rid of those

251
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:27,600
Metals but they'll never do that and

252
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:30,959
that's how like grotesque all of it

253
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,820
really is guys I'm excited about this

254
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,860
and this is fun stuff we're talking

255
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:36,899
about too at the same time

256
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:38,399
so I just want to say a couple things

257
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:40,200
right here

258
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:43,580
one is

259
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,580
that's the recipe I'm making

260
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:49,100
okay I'm excited I got everything here

261
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,100
that I need

262
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:55,200
and I am going to even get my little

263
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:56,160
foot stand out here so I want to read a

264
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,140
little bit here

265
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,060
now to get give everybody a 4-1-1 we're

266
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:00,839
about to make a juice which I'm excited

267
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,820
about

268
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:04,620
to detox bitters but I'm going to talk

269
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:06,060
about different chemicals and things

270
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:07,560
like that how the brain works and all

271
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:09,120
that with just a little bit of the

272
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:11,160
information from brain saver which I'm

273
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,980
excited about

274
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:16,200
and you guys Black Friday was yesterday

275
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:17,880
people are asking me left and right like

276
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:21,120
what's the best this what's the best

277
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:22,680
that I'm going to be using the mm1500 25

278
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,360
off

279
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,980
check it out right there link is in the

280
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:28,920
description in the profile but it's 25

281
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:30,360
off you can get a free cleanse the heel

282
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:34,260
book with it

283
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:36,180
and the mm-1500 is insanely awesome I'll

284
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:40,200
go into that a little bit too if you got

285
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:42,360
suckered into another juicer I feel bad

286
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:44,160
because this I don't know if you know

287
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:46,320
saves money

288
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,720
and the other juicer companies I noticed

289
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,880
and the influencers that are pushing

290
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,959
those other juicers think everybody's

291
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,060
rich

292
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:55,860
and you can just throw away produce when

293
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:57,899
you juice it's really sad I'll talk

294
00:11:55,860 --> 00:12:00,540
about that more later it's interesting

295
00:11:57,899 --> 00:12:02,279
you guys I'm excited let's go

296
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:04,500
I'm reading something called melting

297
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:06,060
down right here

298
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:08,399
page 30

299
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:11,160
in brain saver

300
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:13,500
when our brains get hot and there's

301
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:16,200
metal involved

302
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:19,500
this is a big deal the toxic heavy metal

303
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:21,360
particles break down

304
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:23,040
so first of all

305
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,740
that is so Advanced that information

306
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:28,920
right there I'm just reading one line

307
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:33,000
out of brain saver

308
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:35,220
and it's mind-blowing just that one line

309
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,660
so when our brains get hot and there's

310
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:38,880
metal involved

311
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:42,480
the toxic heavy metal particles break

312
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:44,700
down the metals melt

313
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,440
besides research doesn't know that

314
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:48,060
I'll talk about why it's so important to

315
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:51,540
know this

316
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:54,180
and yeah

317
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:56,639
toxic heavy metals in the brain get wear

318
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:59,300
and tear when electrical currents are

319
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,300
entering them

320
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,700
so you got all this electricity right

321
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:04,139
here electricity is running through the

322
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:06,839
brain

323
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:11,100
running through the neurons

324
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:13,079
and as electricity is hitting tiny tiny

325
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:15,899
the active particles tiny tiny

326
00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:19,380
septoparticles hitting these tiny metal

327
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:22,800
particles this Nano metal

328
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:27,600
it starts to melt down

329
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:30,060
foreign piece of information right there

330
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,820
when electrical currents are entering

331
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:34,860
them they start to change

332
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:36,240
so the metal in everybody's branding

333
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:37,860
remember I opened this up talking about

334
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,899
Adderall I was opening up talking about

335
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:41,940
the drugs all the students are on all

336
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:44,339
the kids are on I talked about all of

337
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:46,320
that if you guys just got on here I just

338
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:49,560
did a whole talk about that

339
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:52,200
well with the ADHD all the different

340
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:54,839
focusing concentration problems we're

341
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:57,240
dealing with a metal

342
00:13:54,839 --> 00:14:00,480
Alicia says can't decide which juicer to

343
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:02,600
get 1500 900 I can just only say this

344
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,040
from my experience

345
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:08,279
is that

346
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,779
um the 1500 does other things so it's

347
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:11,820
incredible not only does it have that

348
00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:13,440
high compression where you can actually

349
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:16,800
squeeze out so much juice and save money

350
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:19,560
the other thing it does is it makes it

351
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,579
makes like hummus and it makes salsa and

352
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:22,920
it makes

353
00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:24,060
ice cream and it makes like you know

354
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:26,279
what I mean it's incredible what it does

355
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:27,240
nut Butters and nut milks it's insane

356
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:30,060
really

357
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:32,880
all right so I'm in rice Melton says

358
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:34,860
what that chapter is I'm on page 30. I'm

359
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,720
on alloy bringing

360
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:38,880
right and it's blowing your mind

361
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,680
incredible

362
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:43,920
Cornelius says every line of brain saver

363
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:46,920
is amazing every line it really is it's

364
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:48,720
actually blows my mind every time

365
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:50,940
so

366
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,480
as the electrical electrical currents

367
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:55,680
are entering

368
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:58,139
the metal

369
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:00,600
they start to change

370
00:14:58,139 --> 00:15:02,220
their shapes change

371
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:05,899
she got all these people that are

372
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:08,940
dealing with anxiety depression OCD

373
00:15:05,899 --> 00:15:10,199
depersonalization bipolar

374
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:11,459
right

375
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:13,199
and they're dealing with all these

376
00:15:11,459 --> 00:15:16,320
different issues focus and concentration

377
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:19,440
this is just some I'm only mentioning a

378
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:21,779
couple of different conditions

379
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:24,300
and as they're dealing with that they're

380
00:15:21,779 --> 00:15:27,540
dealing with electrical currents

381
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:28,980
entering into these tiny little reactive

382
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:32,040
particles these tiny little

383
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:35,160
nanoparticles of metal and then changing

384
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:37,920
the metal inside their brain

385
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:38,820
so the shapes of the metal start to

386
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,639
change

387
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:45,120
corrosion then occurs

388
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:47,820
the smaller the particles the more

389
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,019
easily they melt under the heat of the

390
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:52,139
brain

391
00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:54,680
and here's the thing if metals are in

392
00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:57,000
the brain getting people more emotional

393
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:59,899
speaking for people when people don't

394
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,860
want that the metals are actually

395
00:15:59,899 --> 00:16:03,360
controlling people and that's what the

396
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:06,000
industries love

397
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:08,519
one thing the industries do know is they

398
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,459
know Metals will mess your head up

399
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:14,760
and then you'll require lots of

400
00:16:11,459 --> 00:16:18,300
pharmaceuticals see how it works lots of

401
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:21,360
metal inside your brain will mess you up

402
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:25,459
so that you're in the need for lots of

403
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,459
drugs that's how the game works

404
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:30,060
so these Metals this shape changes

405
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:31,860
corrosion can occur the smaller the

406
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:33,480
particles the more easily they melt

407
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:35,760
under the heat of the brain and here's

408
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:38,399
where I'm going back to this so when

409
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:40,320
metals get us really depressed and then

410
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:43,560
we're really upset because their

411
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:46,500
depression is torturing us

412
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:50,459
more heat is generated

413
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:52,019
if metals are giving us anxiety and

414
00:16:50,459 --> 00:16:53,699
we're suffering from anxiety and

415
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:57,720
struggling from anxiety

416
00:16:53,699 --> 00:17:00,920
it's more heat on the brain more heat on

417
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,920
the metal particles

418
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:06,000
if someone's bipolar and they're really

419
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:08,400
up and down and they're manic they're in

420
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,640
Mania and they're just ore in this anger

421
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,439
this this unbelievable anger occurrence

422
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,760
for things that they shouldn't be angry

423
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,679
about because they're suffering and

424
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:19,380
they're struggling mentally emotionally

425
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:22,319
it's more heat generating

426
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:24,480
which actually puts more heat into the

427
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:26,780
particles of metal that are inside their

428
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,780
brain

429
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:34,559
when toxic heavy metals that reside in

430
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:38,520
the brain melt they transform into a

431
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:40,980
liquid gas chemical composition

432
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:43,080
but guys is like

433
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:45,320
seriously when I got that piece of

434
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,320
information

435
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,940
of compassion my mind was blown

436
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,000
the thing is is research and science

437
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:56,760
doesn't know any of this

438
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,280
unless they poach this

439
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:02,340
piece of information which probably will

440
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:04,919
someone will poach it

441
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:07,200
so when toxic heavy metals that reside

442
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:09,960
in the brain melt

443
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:13,080
they transform into a liquid gas

444
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:16,380
chemical composition that is the metals

445
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:19,260
change from a solid to a liquid gas

446
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:23,580
and can spread and cover more ground

447
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:26,360
inside the brain more easily

448
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:30,500
so our electricity is melting these tiny

449
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:30,500
ectochemicals size chemicals

450
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:35,400
these tiny septal chemicals these tiny

451
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:38,520
nanochemicals or brain electricities

452
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:40,620
melting them they're then turning into a

453
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:42,840
liquid gas and then they're traveling

454
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:45,059
through the brain more easily and that's

455
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:48,000
why someone's condition gets worse as

456
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:49,799
years go by or months go by next thing

457
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,440
you know it Adderall is not cutting it

458
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:54,059
for their focus and concentration next

459
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,559
thing you know they're antidepressant is

460
00:18:54,059 --> 00:18:57,600
making them feel worse next thing you

461
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:59,039
note their anti their anti-anxiety meds

462
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,539
are making them feel worse next thing

463
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:02,400
you know they're getting worse overall

464
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:06,000
and they're having more struggles and

465
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:08,880
more problems because those metals are

466
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,380
turning into liquid gas and then

467
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,140
spreading

468
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:15,780
through the brain

469
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:17,160
a little mm school today you guys know I

470
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:19,400
was going to come out and do some mm

471
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,400
School

472
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:24,900
too funny I'm reading right out of brain

473
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:29,460
saver if you guys just got here 40 it's

474
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:32,760
even 41 off I think 42 off

475
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:34,140
something like that amazon.com get them

476
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:37,620
for presents and stuff if you're out

477
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:40,020
there looking for deals and stuff these

478
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:41,520
are Bibles they're thick they're filled

479
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:43,980
with information

480
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:45,960
over 40 off

481
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:50,419
it's insane the price you can get them

482
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:50,419
at amazon.com us it's actually insane

483
00:19:51,539 --> 00:19:55,679
it's

484
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:58,320
I feel like it's an Angelic blessing to

485
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:01,880
make it affordable for people that's

486
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,880
really a special thing

487
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:08,340
this means that as toxic heavy metals in

488
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,320
the brain heat up and melt you guys they

489
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:13,500
move

490
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:16,679
and they can slowly travel to adjacent

491
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:19,260
brain tissue over the years they melt

492
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:22,799
they turn into liquid gas and they move

493
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:27,679
and they travel so that mercury moves

494
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:27,679
and travels slowly as the years go by

495
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:33,240
melting toxic heavy metals in the brain

496
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:35,760
are one reason why so many conditions

497
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:37,980
and symptoms Alzheimer's is just one

498
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:40,679
example that's just one

499
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:44,220
for example worsens with time the gas

500
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:46,320
alone can worsen any any mental physical

501
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:49,200
or emotional condition

502
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:52,919
any physical emotional mental condition

503
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:56,179
worsens from that moving metal that

504
00:20:52,919 --> 00:21:01,580
turned into gas transformed into gas

505
00:20:56,179 --> 00:21:01,580
from electrical heat that's occurring

506
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:06,480
another reason brain conditions worsen

507
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:08,400
with time is that more toxic heavy

508
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,559
metals continue to collect in certain

509
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:13,559
areas of the brain

510
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:16,220
the brain's electromagnetic field draws

511
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:16,220
metal in

512
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:28,620
nobody knows that

513
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:30,620
there's no Neuroscience guy there's no

514
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:33,000
Neuroscience doctor there's no

515
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:35,400
Neuroscience lady there's no

516
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,919
Neuroscience anybody it's just

517
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:39,120
unbelievable when this information came

518
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:41,880
through

519
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:43,860
I was just like are you just as like

520
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:45,780
unbelievable are you kidding

521
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:48,179
so another reason brain conditions worse

522
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:49,559
than with time is that more toxic heavy

523
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:50,820
metals continue to collect in certain

524
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:53,280
areas of the brain the brain's

525
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:57,600
electromagnetic electromagnetic field

526
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:59,659
draws Metals in nobody knows that the

527
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:03,900
brain has an electromagnetic field

528
00:21:59,659 --> 00:22:07,740
nobody knows that it draws Metals in

529
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:10,020
that's just incredible creating in a

530
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:12,840
an accumulation effect

531
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:14,580
that makes large deposits of toxic heavy

532
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:16,980
metals keep growing so what that means

533
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:19,380
you guys is pockets of metals that

534
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:20,880
reside inside the brain

535
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:23,580
grow

536
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:26,159
they grow because of an electromagnetic

537
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:28,380
effect that the brain has as more toxic

538
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:30,780
heavy metals enter to your Bot into your

539
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:33,840
body whether it's Pharmaceuticals

540
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:35,400
and that's the other crazy thing

541
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,200
you got all these students on

542
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:39,299
Pharmaceuticals so they can focus and

543
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:42,120
concentrate

544
00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:43,919
and at the same time the metals in these

545
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:46,559
Pharmaceuticals

546
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:49,980
are actually accumulating they're going

547
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:52,500
into pockets in areas of the brain and

548
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:54,919
building up Bigger Pockets in areas of

549
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,919
the brain

550
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:01,860
the larger the deposit the greater it's

551
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:04,940
electromagnetic pull

552
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:08,640
meaning that it will keep attracting

553
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:11,220
toxic heavy metals into it making the

554
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:14,340
deposit larger and larger over time

555
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:17,240
so what this is saying

556
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:20,000
is that the more metals that are being

557
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:22,380
electromagnetically brought in

558
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,960
attracting to the deposits that are

559
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:27,900
already there that exist more metals

560
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:31,740
that go into those deposits

561
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:34,620
make it so the deposits grow but the

562
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:37,620
electromagnetic field gets stronger in

563
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:41,419
those deposits attracting even more

564
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:41,419
metal as time goes on

565
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:46,980
well the brain's electromagnetic field

566
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:49,980
is drawing toxic heavy metals into other

567
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:52,799
areas of the brain too the metals tend

568
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:55,740
to accumulate where the field is

569
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:59,520
stronger due to these nuggets

570
00:23:55,740 --> 00:24:01,080
of toxic heavy metals we got Nuggets in

571
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:04,140
our heads

572
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:06,780
so if you got 80 000 students watching a

573
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:09,440
college football game in the stands and

574
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:12,120
the majority are on all of these drugs

575
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:14,940
to manage

576
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:16,940
their mental emotional physical problems

577
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:20,640
they have with their brain

578
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:21,559
nuggets are being created inside their

579
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:25,500
head

580
00:24:21,559 --> 00:24:27,480
nuggets of electromagnetic pull

581
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:28,860
occurring

582
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:31,740
where

583
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:34,679
they're 18 right now they're 19 years

584
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:39,059
old they're 20 they're 21 they're 22 but

585
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:40,620
when they're 41 42 43 44 and they got

586
00:24:39,059 --> 00:24:42,240
these nuggets inside their head that

587
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:44,280
have been there way too long and their

588
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,440
conditions have worsened over the years

589
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:48,059
no one's done anything for them doesn't

590
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:50,280
they don't even understand how they even

591
00:24:48,059 --> 00:24:52,380
got there to that position they're still

592
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,700
on drugs most of them probably if not

593
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:57,860
even more

594
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:57,860
it's really sad when you think about it

595
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:03,059
when I'm reading out of brain saver

596
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:05,100
mind-blowing information brain saver and

597
00:25:03,059 --> 00:25:08,220
I got brain saver protocols right here

598
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:09,900
you guys I'm excited I'm on page 31 of

599
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:11,460
brain saver I got brain saver protocols

600
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:13,559
we're going to be making brand detox

601
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:15,299
bitters

602
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:16,740
because it's really helpful for our

603
00:25:15,299 --> 00:25:20,299
brains in so many different ways these

604
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:20,299
are the greatest books of all time

605
00:25:21,299 --> 00:25:26,580
since nobody challenges me

606
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,679
on any debates or anything

607
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:31,200
since nobody says hey let's actually

608
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:33,179
have that guy debate a neuroscience guy

609
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,460
they won't do it

610
00:25:33,179 --> 00:25:37,559
because they really can't talk about

611
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:39,659
anything they don't really know anything

612
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:41,340
they'll give you the five best reasons

613
00:25:39,659 --> 00:25:43,440
why maybe you can get a better sleep at

they'll say that five best tips of how

619
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:56,059
that's that's what that's what

620
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:58,980
Neuroscience has now that's all you got

that's like f you man how stupid

625
00:26:06,299 --> 00:26:12,179
they have no answers whatsoever

626
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:14,460
on any level about why anybody's brains

627
00:26:12,179 --> 00:26:16,380
are all funked and having problems and

628
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:18,539
symptoms and conditions and at the same

neuroscientist blah blah blah make sure

633
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:30,659
you shut your devices off before bed

634
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:33,179

00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:41,880
with the worst panic attacks the worst

639
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:44,520
the worst anxiety the worst depression

640
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:46,559
the worst bipolar the worst OCD the

641
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:50,240
worst anything yeah that'll fix them and

642
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:50,240
get answers that'll really work

643
00:26:51,419 --> 00:26:56,820
when it comes to Mercury did I really

644
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,980
say F you that's just terrible when it

645
00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:00,860
comes to Mercury deposits

646
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:02,940
they're not just formed through

647
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:04,740
electromagnetic pool Mercury doesn't

648
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:06,299
need this electromagnetic field to

649
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:08,820
accumulate in the brain even though it

650
00:27:06,299 --> 00:27:10,679
uses the electromagnetic field Mercury

651
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:12,240
finds Mercury on its own that's another

652
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:14,520
thing research and science says now

653
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:17,820
Mercury inside the brain causing autism

654
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:19,799
and ADHD nocd and Alzheimer's and

655
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:22,140
Dementia or anything else anxiety

656
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:24,500
depression Mercury that's inside our

657
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,500
brain

658
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:31,320
actually Builds on itself Mercury

659
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:35,900
attracts Mercury that's one of the

660
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:35,900
metals that actually attracts itself

661
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:43,020
when it's inside our brain especially

662
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:45,179
so Mercury doesn't need this

663
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:48,059
electromagnetic field to accumulate in

664
00:27:45,179 --> 00:27:50,760
the brain Mercury finds Mercury on its

665
00:27:48,059 --> 00:27:53,520
own with Mercury deposits forming in the

666
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:56,039
brain both from electromagnet magnetic

667
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:58,140
fields and from Mercury's tendency to

668
00:27:56,039 --> 00:28:00,900
find Mercury Mercury finds itself

669
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:02,700
Mercury deposits are that much more of a

670
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:03,779
hindrance this is why Mercury really

671
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:06,059
sucks

672
00:28:03,779 --> 00:28:07,380
and people are filled with it inside

673
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:09,360
their brains

674
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:11,940
and so when you think about the 80 000

675
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:14,039
students that are watching a college

676
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:15,779
football game

677
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:18,179
are screaming and yelling and cheering

678
00:28:15,779 --> 00:28:20,340
but they're all drugged up

679
00:28:18,179 --> 00:28:22,380
almost all of them

680
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:24,179
one way or another

681
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:25,799
when you think about that

682
00:28:24,179 --> 00:28:28,260
and you got to realize how much mercury

683
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:30,620
is in all of their brains and how that

684
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:30,620
works

685
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:34,919
that's just unbelievable

686
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:37,200
if we're experiencing a lot of friction

687
00:28:34,919 --> 00:28:39,360
and stress in our lives electricity

688
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,460
travels through our brain at a higher

689
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:44,159
intensity and velocity

690
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:46,039
so if you're up against some friction

691
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:48,720
if you're up against some stress

692
00:28:46,039 --> 00:28:50,700
electricity is flying through your brain

693
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,980
we're talking about a whole nother

694
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:56,220
velocity going on there

695
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:58,679
because adrenaline both increases heart

696
00:28:56,220 --> 00:29:00,360
rate and enters the brain raising the

697
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:01,559
brain's heat levels

698
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:03,360
if you're under stress you've got

699
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:05,820
adrenaline Brewing now if you're under

700
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:08,220
stress you got adrenaline cooking that's

701
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:10,500
what you have right that's just how life

702
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:13,020
Works Beverly says wish I knew this 40

703
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:15,179
years ago

704
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:19,320
first person that came to see me when I

705
00:29:15,179 --> 00:29:22,320
opened my office 40 years ago almost

706
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:25,140
the first person that's came to see me

707
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:28,380
and found answers

708
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:32,059
said I wish I knew this 40 years ago

709
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:32,059
and that was almost 40 years ago

710
00:29:36,419 --> 00:29:41,880
I was just reading an Amazon review

711
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:43,980
of someone saying that the brain saver

712
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:46,740
books are incredible

713
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:50,880
and then saying I worked with Anthony

714
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:52,679
William personally many many years ago

715
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:55,380
don't quote me on exact the exact

716
00:29:52,679 --> 00:29:58,679
wording but many many years ago

717
00:29:55,380 --> 00:30:01,740
and he saved my life

718
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:03,600
and then they wrote this Amazon review

719
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:05,940
it's really cool it was really cool it

720
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:08,460
was cool to see when you've helped out

721
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:10,380
people so many years ago long before the

722
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:13,500
books came out and you helped out people

723
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:15,899
and you saved their lives it's just it's

724
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:17,820
such a blessing that's why I just love

725
00:30:15,899 --> 00:30:19,919
being here doing this that's why when

726
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:22,320
people don't cite the medical meme

727
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:24,779
information they make others lose out on

728
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:27,240
so much precious material and time and

729
00:30:24,779 --> 00:30:30,299
precious things and many times decades

730
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:32,220
later they might find mm then but they

731
00:30:30,299 --> 00:30:34,520
lost two decades or a decade of like

732
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:34,520
time

733
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:43,080
again the more toxic heavy metals in the

734
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:45,659
brain the hotter it runs if you have

735
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:47,220
more it's like a vicious cycle check

736
00:30:45,659 --> 00:30:50,580
this out

737
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:52,440
the more Metals you have in your brain

738
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:55,200
the more problems we have emotionally

739
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:56,640
mentally and physically

740
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,279
but the more problems we have

741
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:02,640
emotionally mentally and physically we

742
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:05,640
feel more stress and get upset

743
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:08,700
so therefore we get suspicious cycle we

744
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:10,640
get upset or stressed out

745
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:13,320
and then that's cranking up the heat

746
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:15,299
melting more metal

747
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:16,620
and moving more metal around in our

748
00:31:15,299 --> 00:31:18,360
brain

749
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:19,799
we don't know why we're sick we don't

750
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:22,500
know why we're mentally emotionally

751
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:24,539
physically sick or struggling the metals

752
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:26,820
are actually doing it in our brain

753
00:31:24,539 --> 00:31:28,140
the more upset we get the more the

754
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:29,640
metals move

755
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:30,960
and we can't do anything about it

756
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:32,880
because we don't understand it so we're

757
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:34,620
caught in this Catch-22 this vicious

758
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,419
cycle

759
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:38,279
so the more toxic heavy metals in the

760
00:31:36,419 --> 00:31:40,919
brain the hotter it runs and again

761
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:42,299
Metals retain the heat that's a whole

762
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:43,860
other problem medical research and

763
00:31:42,299 --> 00:31:46,200
science don't realize this metal is

764
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:49,559
inside your brain those yactoseized

765
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:52,380
Metals in the brain they retain heat

766
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:54,299
causing an additional healing up inside

767
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:57,899
your brain

768
00:31:54,299 --> 00:32:00,539
it can become a vicious cycle

769
00:31:57,899 --> 00:32:04,020
for instance someone who's perpetually

770
00:32:00,539 --> 00:32:07,620
angry about anything and everything

771
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:09,600
or who has frequent spells of anger may

772
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:11,159
have higher levels of toxic heavy metals

773
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:13,080
in the brain in the first place that are

774
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:16,799
aggravating that anger you guys I'm

775
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:20,039
reading out of brain saver amazon.com us

776
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:22,460
over 40 off like 42 off or something

777
00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:26,039
like it's incredible right now

778
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:28,380
amazon.com us you want both books I

promise you this you want both of them

780
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:33,419
because they were one book you want both

781
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:35,640
and we're gonna be making this I have

782
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:37,500
the juicer out you see some spinach here

783
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:39,600
some kale here some dandelion green some

784
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:42,020
wild dandelion greens and you see some

785
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,020
apples

786
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,799
it's gonna be fun

787
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:52,140
all right

788
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:55,140
as he is generated for any reason

789
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:57,840
the metals change shape and form those

790
00:32:55,140 --> 00:33:00,299
anger spells will then generate more

791
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:03,720
heat as anger raises the electrical

792
00:33:00,299 --> 00:33:06,120
field creating an electrical storm

793
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:08,580
which in turn melts more metal so that

794
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:10,799
it spreads and has the potential to

795
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:15,000
interfere with even more electrical

796
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:17,580
signals in the brain making us mental

797
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,919
making us emotional

798
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:21,720
making us mental emotional and

799
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:23,279
physically

800
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:25,440
struggling

801
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:27,360
those melting toxic heavy metals

802
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,799
spreading their liquid gas can hinder

803
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,539
bodily functions and communication

804
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:32,940
because I just read

805
00:33:30,539 --> 00:33:34,799
a half a page less than half a page from

806
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:37,799
here to here I've read a little bit off

807
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:39,779
of page 30 and I read

808
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:42,679
um just a little bit of a half of a

809
00:33:39,779 --> 00:33:45,240
section in page 31 just now brain saver

810
00:33:42,679 --> 00:33:46,620
that alone what you have to know this

811
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,760
that's why these are the greatest books

812
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:50,700
of all time

813
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:53,039
hands down I could say that I can judge

814
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:55,799
these books just like anybody else can

815
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:56,880
and and that's what I do when Spirit of

816
00:33:55,799 --> 00:33:59,220
compassion is giving me the information

817
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,659
from above I can be I can have my own

818
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:02,220
opinion

819
00:34:00,659 --> 00:34:03,720
and they are the greatest books of all

820
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:06,360
time and I'm going to tell you what's so

821
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:08,399
incredible about this I only read a

822
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:10,859
little tidbit inside

823
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:13,679
the brain saver book

824
00:34:10,859 --> 00:34:15,839
but even that little tidbit beats out

825
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:18,540
any kind of Neuroscience theories that

826
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:20,159
are out there now in anywhere it beats

827
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:21,839
out any information known in clinics

828
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:23,520
about what's wrong with people with

829
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:26,520
these symptoms and conditions

830
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:29,159
it supersedes medical research and

831
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:31,919
Science by light years actually

832
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:33,240

00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:35,099
little bit that's why these are the

and uh

894
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:59,460
I'm putting two dropper fulls right

895
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:01,260
there

896
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:02,460
you know I fully endorsed imagery I'm

897
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:04,740
not going to go into all the details

898
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:06,240
because I always do I sit here and I

899
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:07,920
just go into all the details all the

900
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:10,140
time but I gotta make a juice but I

901
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:12,119
endorse them anyway what I did was I put

902
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:16,079
the lemon balm their incredible lemon

903
00:37:12,119 --> 00:37:17,940
balm right there what I'm finding is I

904
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:20,820
used you know I used to always recommend

905
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:23,040
like the traditional medicinals teas and

906
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:25,200
stuff and and other teas that I like too

907
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:28,320
that are actually really good but I like

908
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:30,900
something more potent more powerful so

909
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:32,820
what I've been doing and because that's

910
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:35,040
the best lemon balm right there you can

911
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:36,359
get anywhere right and lemon balm is a

912
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:38,820
commentative it's for the nerves and

913
00:37:36,359 --> 00:37:41,820
it's a commentative right and

914
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:44,160
so what I'm doing now is I got rid of

915
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:47,520
tea altogether not all together some

916
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:49,980
teas I like but I got rid of some for

917
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:52,740
sure because this is way better so what

918
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:55,380
I do is I take the hot water like that

919
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:57,300
and I put

920
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:59,460
the purest form the best form that I

921
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:01,560
could ever find ever because this is the

922
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:03,960
material the medicinal version of it

923
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:06,359
right and I put it right there and

924
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:07,619
that's what I do now for lemon balm tea

925
00:38:06,359 --> 00:38:09,300
hmm

926
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:12,180

00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:35,780
let's make some juice I'm excited

936
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:39,440
let's get the stuff ready

937
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,940
Marcy said what about hibiscus and

938
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:47,099
raspberry leaf tea you can get those two

939
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:49,260
out there it's incredible Jackie B says

940
00:38:47,099 --> 00:38:51,000
Bemidji is more potent than the actual

941
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:52,980
tea I've noticed well that's the whole

942
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,900
point that's why I've actually just it's

943
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:56,940
a massive upgrade

944
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:59,520
so that's what I do Jackie B is it's

945
00:38:56,940 --> 00:39:00,900
it's a whole other game and that's all

946
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:03,300
that matters always it's always about

947
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:05,220
getting the best you can get Phyllis

948
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:07,320
said there's not enough words or emotion

949
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:09,119
to describe how fortunate I feel to be

950
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:11,339
part of this community the medical

951
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:13,920
medium Community I'm at your service too

952
00:39:11,339 --> 00:39:15,240
here and the thing is though what's

953
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,920
incredible about the medical medium

954
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:18,900
Community is people who have been

955
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:20,700
through hell and back they've actually

956
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:22,859
been scammed out there over and over

957
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:24,540
again they left the Colts out there the

958
00:39:22,859 --> 00:39:26,760
big alternative medicine cult out there

959
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:28,440
which is all saying the same thing like

960
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:31,200
they're all saying the same thing that's

961
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:33,480
when you know it's a cult right anyway

962
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,260
the point is they left those Cults out

963
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,940
there

964
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:38,460
and they found a place where you got

965
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:39,599
your free will your freedom you can you

966
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:41,700
can actually

967
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:42,859
um customize your healing process

968
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:45,780
through the medical beam information

969
00:39:42,859 --> 00:39:47,220
it's not man-made so none of the

970
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:49,740
information is man-made it comes from

971
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:51,300
above so it gives us freedom and it's

972
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:53,280
such a great community and most

973
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:55,440
importantly

974
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:57,180
um most importantly too I wanted to

975
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,140
mention a couple other things the

976
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:59,760
incredible thing about the medical

977
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:01,320
medium Community is people who actually

978
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,960
really do care

979
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:06,359
they actually have compassion for like

980
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:08,579
others because I see like I say I'm at

people in the medical meme Community

983
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:13,800
they actually are at other people's

984
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:15,660
service too they care

985
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:19,200
they're actually like always trying to

987
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:25,020

990
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:32,820
brain saver books brain saver protocols

991
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:36,000
cold and flu protocols in here including

992
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:39,060
for children keep that in mind as well

993
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:41,880
which is incredible too

994
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:44,099
all right so I'm gonna make some juice

995
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:47,640
the bidders detox

996
00:40:44,099 --> 00:40:50,839
so get this thing running right here

997
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:50,839
three to five apples

998
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:55,800
I'm gonna push some apples in there okay

999
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:58,560
now we're gonna do three to five apples

1000
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:59,880
we're gonna do some kale we're gonna do

1001
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:03,079
some spinach we're gonna do some

1002
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:03,079
dandelion greens

1003
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:09,180
I like this detox bitters because it

1004
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:10,740
tastes good too which is incredible and

1005
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:13,020
what it does

1006
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:16,320
for the brain so I'm gonna chop up some

1007
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:20,000
apples if you guys don't mind right

1008
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:20,000
so three to five apples

1009
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:26,000
so I'm gonna get my apples going

1010
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:32,060
get another Apple too let me run some

1011
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,060
through

1012
00:41:36,359 --> 00:41:41,760
now remember with this juicer it's not

1013
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:44,099
only a cold pressed juicer right and it

1014
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:46,200
doesn't have metal touching metal it's

1015
00:41:44,099 --> 00:41:49,560
which is incredible about this juicer

1016
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:51,900
but it's got that compression

1017
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:54,180
so it has that celery attachment that

1018
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:56,579
compression going on there so what that

1019
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:57,420
does is it makes it so you're saving

1020
00:41:56,579 --> 00:41:59,940
money

1021
00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:02,280
so this juicer paid for itself over and

1022
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:03,900
over again and I was talking about like

1023
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:06,420
the other juices out there the juicer

1024
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:08,579
sharks I call them that that enter into

1025
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:11,579
the medical medium community and they

1026
00:42:08,579 --> 00:42:13,980
try to rip people off what happens is

1027
00:42:11,579 --> 00:42:15,720
that they know their juicer doesn't do

1028
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:18,180
this

1029
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:19,260
they know that it doesn't save people

1030
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:22,220
money

1031
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:25,320
but they push it anyway and they noticed

1032
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:26,579
that some of the influencers that are

1033
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:29,579
well known out there they're like

1034
00:42:26,579 --> 00:42:32,339
well-known influencers that stand behind

1035
00:42:29,579 --> 00:42:35,220
those juicers right

1036
00:42:32,339 --> 00:42:37,800
they're involved in those juicers

1037
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:39,420
they have plenty of money

1038
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:40,920
they don't know what it's like to be

1039
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:43,200
wondering like am I going to be able to

1040
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:45,660
buy food this week and if I want to heal

1041
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:47,460
myself I need to be able to save money

1042
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:49,760
somehow they don't they don't care about

1043
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:49,760
that

1044
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:56,520
so what I like about this and the reason

1045
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:59,220
why I stand behind the mm 1500 900 and

1046
00:42:56,520 --> 00:43:02,099
I've worked with the mega is because we

1047
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:04,980
all cared about that see the difference

1048
00:43:02,099 --> 00:43:07,560
so we're like how are we gonna do this

1049
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:11,460
where we can get like people to save

1050
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:13,200
money while healing so the juicer pays

1051
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:15,720
for itself

1052
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:18,240
that's what it was about and it wasn't

1053
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:20,460
about instead selling them a fancy fancy

1054
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:23,160
juicer that pay a lot of money for and

1055
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:25,020
they can just throw away produce

1056
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:27,300
now

1057
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:29,280
food prices are rising Spirit of

1058
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:30,319
compassion's holy food prices were gonna

1059
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:32,819
rise

1060
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:34,680
years ago

1061
00:43:32,819 --> 00:43:38,400
and

1062
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:40,560
that's why I wanted to make sure

1063
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:43,380
that if you're gonna be like making

1064
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:46,200
medicine with your juicer you not only

1065
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:47,640
have a cold pressed juicer to do so but

1066
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:49,560
you have a juicer that's saving you

1067
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:51,599
money and it's squeezing more out of

1068
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:53,460
your food that you're putting through it

1069
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:55,619
you see how it works

1070
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:56,819
Now the recipe we're doing is on page

1071
00:43:55,619 --> 00:44:00,060
304

1072
00:43:56,819 --> 00:44:02,940
right here it's on 304 of the protocols

1073
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:04,800
book it is called brain detox bitters

1074
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:08,359
that's the recipe we're making right now

1075
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:08,359
you guys excited about this

1076
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:13,940
so I'm putting a couple of apples in

1077
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,940
here

1078
00:44:16,859 --> 00:44:22,859
I think that's good

1079
00:44:19,319 --> 00:44:24,720
maybe I'll put one more

1080
00:44:22,859 --> 00:44:28,339
so it's three to five apples in the

1081
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:28,339
recipe I just did two apples

1082
00:44:30,359 --> 00:44:33,920
now here's how it works

1083
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:39,660
with this juicer

1084
00:44:36,119 --> 00:44:42,480
the pulp comes out extremely dry so it's

1085
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:45,000
in the process of extracting as much as

1086
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:48,079
it possibly can out of your produce

1087
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,079
that's the difference

1088
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:55,980
so the reason why the mm-1500 and the

1089
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:59,940
mm-900 came about was because it was

1090
00:44:55,980 --> 00:45:03,000
about making medicine for people to heal

1091
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:04,140
like it's doing their celery juice every

1092
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:07,680
single day

1093
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:10,619
doing their juices every single day

1094
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:12,960
and saving money at the same time

1095
00:45:10,619 --> 00:45:14,460
and then not having Metal Gears touch

1096
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,740
each other like this touch itself the

1097
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:18,000
metal gears

1098
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:19,500
wearing and tearing on itself you know

1099
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,619
what that means when Metal's doing this

1100
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:24,420
you know what happens right

1101
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:26,940
yep you want to choose so that doesn't

1102
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:29,640
just rip up the juice in a few seconds

1103
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:31,560
spit it out throw out a lot of the juice

1104
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:34,440
and also

1105
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:36,420
heat up everything so this is a cold

1106
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:38,280
pressed masticating juicer so it's not

1107
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:40,140
heating up everything people don't

1108
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:41,880
realize those other juicers with the

1109
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:44,339
basket and everything the heating that

1110
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:46,020
occurs it's ripping it up spitting it

1111
00:45:44,339 --> 00:45:48,480
out and then what happens is sure it

1112
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:51,480
might be fun for a second but at the

1113
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:53,460
same time you're spilling out all this

1114
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:55,380
money out of your wallet to buy more

1115
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:57,960
produce to feed that machine it becomes

1116
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:59,760
like a monster you can't give it enough

1117
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:01,680
produce to get you enough juice you have

1118
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:03,720
to do so much more and that's why you'll

1119
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:06,780
even see when the influencers use them

1120
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:10,319
that are behind them they're jumping in

1121
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:12,540
so much produce to get their thing of

1122
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:15,960
juice but so much is going through there

1123
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:17,819
it's like oh yeah sure everybody's Rich

1124
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:19,500
they can do what you're doing there

1125
00:46:17,819 --> 00:46:21,359
because apparently you're not worried

1126
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:22,740
about anything so you must have a lot of

1127
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:25,140
money to just be throwing it out and

1128
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:27,359
down the drain like that and the funny

1129
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:29,040
thing is is that it's like I know I'm

1130
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:31,980
being sarcastic but I'm saying this

1131
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:34,140
because they know there's a juicer that

1132
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:35,579
does save you money and they're not like

1133
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:37,319
you know what there's people who are

1134
00:46:35,579 --> 00:46:39,780
chronically sick

1135
00:46:37,319 --> 00:46:41,040
and you know let's you know there's

1136
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:42,660
people that are chronically sick so

1137
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:44,040
let's get them what they need and stuff

1138
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:45,839
like that it's just it's really

1139
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:49,339
ridiculous how it works I'm gonna drop

1140
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:49,339
some kale in here next actually

1141
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:55,940
so the thing is about

1142
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:55,940
um

1143
00:46:59,579 --> 00:47:03,780
now what you're watching right now is

1144
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:05,940
the Kale's coming through

1145
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:08,700
you're watching pulp that's really

1146
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:12,060
really dry that's what you're seeing

1147
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:14,160
it's almost Dusty dry that's how like

1148
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:18,660
dry it gets there's not going to be any

1149
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:20,460
liquid inside that container right there

1150
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:22,260
so I'm dropping some kale into this

1151
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:24,300
because it's part of the recipe it's two

1152
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:26,460
cups of loosely packed kale

1153
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:30,140
I'm gauging it to what I'm used to doing

1154
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:30,140
to get us too cuffs

1155
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:40,520
so I'm running this um

1156
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:40,520
dinosaur Tail in

1157
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:50,760
now you would need with other juicers so

1158
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:53,339
much more pimp now what you're seeing

1159
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:56,220
right here is dry

1160
00:47:53,339 --> 00:47:58,380
so that's dry

1161
00:47:56,220 --> 00:48:00,000
so people wonder about like my integrity

1162
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:03,660
and stuff they'll be like oh the medical

1163
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:06,480
media whatever it's like oh yeah well

1164
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:08,339
what that does is it saves people who

1165
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:09,780
have chronic illness money

1166
00:48:08,339 --> 00:48:12,180
it's people who have chronic illness

1167
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:13,740
don't have a lot of money unless they

1168
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:15,000
were Rich to begin with and then they

1169
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:16,859
got sick

1170
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,720
but people with chronic illness most

1171
00:48:16,859 --> 00:48:20,339
everybody they don't have a lot of money

1172
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:23,280
because they're spending it on doctors

1173
00:48:20,339 --> 00:48:26,040
doctor appointments they're spending it

1174
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:28,260
in so many different ways like that

1175
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:30,420
and they're not working a lot of people

1176
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:32,460
who are chronically sick don't work

1177
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:34,740
because they can't it's not that they

1178
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:37,260
don't want to work they want to work

1179
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:39,480
and so that's that's something too these

1180
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:43,020
were all the things I thought about that

1181
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:45,240
went into the mm-1500 and the mm-900

1182
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:47,400
it's not like just so oh the guy's got a

1183
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:52,500
juicer he's gonna do some celery There's

1184
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:54,839
real like meaning and thought about it

1185
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:58,339
and that's what people don't realize

1186
00:48:54,839 --> 00:48:58,339
they just don't know that

1187
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:02,640
so that's the kale that's in there so

1188
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:05,940
what I have right here

1189
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:08,339
it's really dry pulp

1190
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:11,220
it's like Dusty dry I don't know if you

1191
00:49:08,339 --> 00:49:13,079
guys have an mm-1500 many of you do I

1192
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:15,240
mean when I'm holding that pulp it's

1193
00:49:13,079 --> 00:49:17,300
unbelievable we have there

1194
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:17,300
so

1195
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:23,760
that alone is incredible

1196
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:25,800
kale tends to foam up so what I'm doing

1197
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:28,260
is I'm just

1198
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:30,599
moving some of that through the screen

1199
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:32,400
right there

1200
00:49:30,599 --> 00:49:34,200
now there's different ways to do it you

1201
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:37,319
can use the screen they give you I use

1202
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:39,780
another screen with my mm-900

1203
00:49:37,319 --> 00:49:41,160
all right so let's knock in a few other

1204
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:44,000
things we're going to put some spinach

1205
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:44,000
down in here too

1206
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:54,859
which is great

1207
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:59,760
okay what you're looking at right here

1208
00:49:57,359 --> 00:50:02,040
is Trace mineral salts lots of Trace

1209
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:04,920
mineral salts

1210
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:07,680
I call these I call these mm 1500s and

1211
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:10,400
900s the medicine makers the medicine

1212
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:10,400
machines

1213
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:14,880
25 off right now

1214
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:18,560
so I'm dropping some spinach down in

1215
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:18,560
here right now this is really incredible

1216
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:26,400
so when you really know why things are

1217
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:29,760
done you'll be like wait a minute that's

1218
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:31,800
different than some Juicer Company

1219
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:33,660
and some influencers pushing out a

1220
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:36,060
juicer because they want to take

1221
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:37,800
advantage of the juicing business that

1222
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:39,660
exploded because medical medium and

1223
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:41,160
celery juice right they want to take

1224
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:44,040
advantage of that

1225
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:45,960
and but they have their reasons it's not

1226
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:48,119
to save people money it's not to juice

1227
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:51,119
it and extract to have like an

1228
00:50:48,119 --> 00:50:52,619
extraction from that high pressure and

1229
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:53,940
it's not that you know it's not that's

1230
00:50:52,619 --> 00:50:56,599
not what they're in it for they're not

1231
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:56,599
in it for that

1232
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:05,220
so I got my spinach down in there now

1233
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:07,500
I'm gonna put some dandelions in there

1234
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:09,839
too so I got these wild dandelions and

1235
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:11,099
if you guys know this these are the real

1236
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:14,839
bitter

1237
00:51:11,099 --> 00:51:14,839
some are more bitter than others

1238
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:20,119
there we go

1239
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:25,280
now I'm not trying to rush it too

1240
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:29,599
because I'm talking

1241
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:37,260
so

1242
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:39,839
what's incredible about this brain saver

1243
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:42,359
bitters

1244
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:46,440
is how potent it is but it's the

1245
00:51:42,359 --> 00:51:48,480
combination Spirit of compassion

1246
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:50,280
you know told me about which is so

1247
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:52,520
important so I want to show you this

1248
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:52,520
poll

1249
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:56,059
now what you're seeing

1250
00:51:57,059 --> 00:52:01,619
you're seeing dry Dusty pulp just pop

1251
00:51:59,579 --> 00:52:02,940
out of here like this can you guys see

1252
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:05,040
that

1253
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:07,380
that's where the savings come from so

1254
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:08,940
you have a juicer that pays for itself

1255
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:11,940
so you're saving because food cost

1256
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:13,980
prices are up so it's like healing while

1257
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:15,960
you're saving money but it's not even

1258
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:18,000
just that it's the extraction process of

1259
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:20,460
a cold pressed masticating juicer too

1260
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,319
without having all that metal rubbing

1261
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:24,780
each other too which is really important

1262
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:26,099
grinding into each other right so that's

1263
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:29,599
the dry

1264
00:52:26,099 --> 00:52:29,599
pulp which is so incredible

1265
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:35,579
so what I'm doing is I'm just moving

1266
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:37,800
so you have some foam left over when you

1267
00:52:35,579 --> 00:52:40,200
do anything with greens you'll have foam

1268
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:42,359
one is anything with greens so I'm just

1269
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:44,460
moving the juice in to finish that up

1270
00:52:42,359 --> 00:52:47,819

1295
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:05,160
toxic chemicals toxic chemicals from the

1296
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:07,140
brain that cloud the mind so we're

1297
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:09,960
talking about heavy metals but we're

1298
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:11,880
there are thousands of toxic chemicals

1299
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:14,040
getting into people's brains and we have

1300
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:15,660
the heavy metal cleanses and detoxes we

1301
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:17,220
have all that in the books but we also

1302
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:19,500
need something for all the other

1303
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:22,260
chemicals that make it even worse and

1304
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:25,020
worse and worse April says where do I

1305
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:26,579
purchase the juicer you have so link is

1306
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:29,760
in the description link is in the

1307
00:54:26,579 --> 00:54:31,319
profile it's Omega juicers.com but check

1308
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:33,660
out the link to find it this is the

1309
00:54:31,319 --> 00:54:34,740
mm-1500 so make sure you actually get

1310
00:54:33,660 --> 00:54:36,540
the right one because you might

1311
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:39,780
accidentally get the wrong one at Omega

1312
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:41,880
and then that one doesn't do what these

1313
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:44,940
do it doesn't do with the 900 and the

1314
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:48,059
1500 do so that's important to know

1315
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:50,280
but this is the 1500 the 1500 you're

1316
00:54:48,059 --> 00:54:53,960
looking at dry

1317
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:53,960
you're looking at dry pulp

1318
00:54:54,960 --> 00:55:00,720
it's the difference is unbelievable I

1319
00:54:57,720 --> 00:55:02,220
saw someone do an insta story with the

1320
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:03,960
fancy fancy juicers that are going

1321
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:05,400
around right now that they you know

1322
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:07,099
busted into they're like the Sharks

1323
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:11,280
busting into the medical meme community

1324
00:55:07,099 --> 00:55:14,220
and they had so much wet pulp

1325
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:16,260
that if that it was it was insane and it

1326
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:19,079
was a pile of Pulp

1327
00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:23,160
and it was ridiculous right and it's

1328
00:55:19,079 --> 00:55:26,460
like yeah if you're rich fine juice like

1329
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:29,040
that but buy all those like fruits and

1330
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:30,780
vegetables buy the truckloads because

1331
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:32,460
you're gonna feed that Beast if you want

1332
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:34,380
to juice every day

1333
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:36,119
that juicer is going to cost you so much

1334
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:37,079
money so the difference is the reason

1335
00:55:36,119 --> 00:55:39,359
why

1336
00:55:37,079 --> 00:55:41,339
people like wonder why I stand by things

1337
00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:42,599
you guys know why I stand by what I

1338
00:55:41,339 --> 00:55:47,280
stand by

1339
00:55:42,599 --> 00:55:50,520
but this was a legendary decision

1340
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:53,280
meaning legendary product right it's

1341
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:57,119
like the 1500 and 900 how do you save

1342
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:59,400
people who are struggling

1343
00:55:57,119 --> 00:56:02,160
because they're struggling financially

1344
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:05,819
they don't have a lot of money they have

1345
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:08,520
to heal you got to get better and heal

1346
00:56:05,819 --> 00:56:10,800
so this was all about the person

1347
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:13,140
struggling that's what the juicer was

1348
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:15,240
about because if it wasn't

1349
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:18,720
then I could have done juicers 20 years

1350
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:20,940
ago I could have been the juicer guy for

1351
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:23,099
the last 30 years

1352
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:25,559
there's no there's no meaning behind

1353
00:56:23,099 --> 00:56:26,940
that you have to have something you have

1354
00:56:25,559 --> 00:56:29,040
to have something behind there that's

1355
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:30,599
just mind-blowing like what's the

1356
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:32,339
meaning like what's the mind-blowing

1357
00:56:30,599 --> 00:56:34,380
nature of it because I could have done

1358
00:56:32,339 --> 00:56:36,359
juicers and done juicer companies and

1359
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:38,700
stuff for 30 years like and been the

1360
00:56:36,359 --> 00:56:42,300
juicer guy like whatever but

1361
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:44,760
the reason for this was how can we make

1362
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:48,119
something like work where it gives you

1363
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:50,160
that extraction where you save money and

1364
00:56:48,119 --> 00:56:52,619
it pays for itself and you heal at the

1365
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:54,359
same time and that's when boom and

1366
00:56:52,619 --> 00:56:55,380
that's why I have anything to do with

1367
00:56:54,359 --> 00:56:56,760
users

1368
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:57,540
that's why I have anything to do with

1369
00:56:56,760 --> 00:57:00,960
them

1370
00:56:57,540 --> 00:57:03,300
and so that's the 1500 900. I never told

1371
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:04,859
that story because I you know it's like

1372
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:06,359
today's like a different chill day it's

1373
00:57:04,859 --> 00:57:07,920
a different day plus it's they they have

1374
00:57:06,359 --> 00:57:09,660

00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:11,099
know what if someone wants to take

1376
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:13,740
advantage of that take advantage of it

1377
00:57:11,099 --> 00:57:15,359
now and know why the whole reason was

1378
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:19,079
behind it

00:57:15,359 --> 00:57:21,059

to get people what they need right but

1424
00:58:58,559 --> 00:59:02,819
and this is stuff that matters to me it

1425
00:59:01,140 --> 00:59:04,740
matters to me so I could have done

1426
00:59:02,819 --> 00:59:06,599
juicers like 30 years ago I could have

1427
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:08,819
done juicers all these years and just

1428
00:59:06,599 --> 00:59:12,119
been like the juicer guy

1429
00:59:08,819 --> 00:59:15,420
and whatever but

1430
00:59:12,119 --> 00:59:17,579
that's not gonna really move the needle

1431
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:20,339
I need something to help people move the

1432
00:59:17,579 --> 00:59:22,200
needle so this was kind of a project of

1433
00:59:20,339 --> 00:59:25,020
love where

1434
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:27,359
these guys were like yeah

1435
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:28,619
let's try to help people there's a

1436
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:31,859
difference and that's the difference

1437
00:59:28,619 --> 00:59:34,500
right there so that's why this to me is

1438
00:59:31,859 --> 00:59:36,119
like a miracle every time I see it and

1439
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:37,380
I'm always buying less produce and I

1440
00:59:36,119 --> 00:59:40,140
think about everybody else who's buying

1441
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:43,020
less produce and check out the cold and
