[1013.20 - 1018.52] travel from to be here this evening I'm
[1015.16 - 1020.96] from the Lake Tahoe Reno area beautiful
[1018.52 - 1023.68] so yeah a bit of a drive but not too far
[1020.96 - 1025.44] or short flight yes short flight yes
[1023.68 - 1027.56] would you like to open up and tell us a
[1025.44 - 1029.84] little bit about your healing
[1027.56 - 1032.52] Journey well I've been chronically ill
[1029.84 - 1034.96] for a long time even when I was a child
[1032.52 - 1038.36] I had something called valley fever I
[1034.96 - 1040.12] lived in the California um Valley and I
[1038.36 - 1044.00] contracted it a couple times so I had
[1040.12 - 1046.04] weak lungs and I also had weak joints
[1044.00 - 1048.92] and I was never diagnosed with really
[1046.04 - 1050.64] anything else than that growing up and
[1048.92 - 1054.72] and probably my symptoms didn't really
[1050.64 - 1056.64] start to be um really noticeable until
[1054.72 - 1059.72] after I had kids and I started getting
[1056.64 - 1062.48] really a bad chronic fatigue um I
[1059.72 - 1065.00] started having few concussions from
[1062.48 - 1067.32] accidents throughout my life and my
[1065.00 - 1069.36] neuro fatigue was really really bad
[1067.32 - 1071.72] where I'd had trouble with my short-term
[1069.36 - 1073.32] memory and I wouldn't you know you walk
[1071.72 - 1075.20] across the room and you're like what am
[1073.32 - 1078.60] I doing over here and then I could never
[1075.20 - 1080.64] remember I forget people's names and I
[1078.60 - 1082.52] was young at the time and I just was
[1080.64 - 1084.84] able to cover it enough where people
[1082.52 - 1087.56] didn't really notice it cuz a lot of us
[1084.84 - 1089.96] with chronic fatigue become um good
[1087.56 - 1093.48] actors and actresses to not disclose
[1089.96 - 1096.20] what's going on um but later in life I
[1093.48 - 1101.44] was um had Peri I had trouble with my
[1096.20 - 1104.32] periods my menstrual cycle um depression
[1101.44 - 1106.56] and it wasn't until I got diagnosed with
[1104.32 - 1110.52] Mero limes disease I started to really
[1106.56 - 1113.12] look into maybe Chang My Lifestyle with
[1110.52 - 1115.52] food I started changing different little
[1113.12 - 1117.56] things at a time like eliminating gluten
[1115.52 - 1119.92] eliminating Dairy and all those things
[1117.56 - 1121.28] helped a little but it wasn't really
[1119.92 - 1124.08] until I found the medical medium
[1121.28 - 1126.84] information in 2018 on a social media
[1124.08 - 1129.36] post and it talked about celery and I
[1126.84 - 1131.52] thought wow I've tried hundreds of other
[1129.36 - 1133.52] things and spent an enormous amount of
[1131.52 - 1135.72] money on those things and did not get
[1133.52 - 1139.76] any better and maybe some things even
[1135.72 - 1142.28] made me worse so I decided to try celery
[1139.76 - 1145.56] juice and I really was a dabbler at the
[1142.28 - 1148.60] beginning cuz I didn't have the um
[1145.56 - 1151.28] capacity to read the books at that point
[1148.60 - 1154.16] or nor listen to it on Audible so I
[1151.28 - 1156.80] would just look up like an encyclopedia
[1154.16 - 1159.32] certain symptoms I was having and and
[1156.80 - 1162.48] and do those protocols and little by
[1159.32 - 1165.40] little I just it happened so quickly
[1162.48 - 1167.24] symptoms were dropping um my allergies
[1165.40 - 1169.28] went away my lifelong allergies I had a
[1167.24 - 1172.76] nickel allergy I talked about
[1169.28 - 1175.00] last night actually that went away so I
[1172.76 - 1178.44] got my energy back I was able to work
[1175.00 - 1180.16] out again my hair was I was losing hair
[1178.44 - 1182.00] in my temples my hair grew back my
[1180.16 - 1184.08] eyelashes grew back so just like these
[1182.00 - 1185.84] little things started happening but it
[1184.08 - 1187.84] wasn't until a little bit later till I
[1185.84 - 1189.44] got deeper into the protocols that the
[1187.84 - 1192.48] bigger symptoms went away like the
[1189.44 - 1194.68] chronic fatigue and the um The Chronic
[1192.48 - 1196.64] joint pain excuse me that I was
[1194.68 - 1199.84] suffering with I used to be able to
[1196.64 - 1202.44] drive without um with Braes on my arms
[1199.84 - 1203.28] like this opening the refrigerator with
[1202.44 - 1205.96] a
[1203.28 - 1209.16] towel having my kids lift the pots up on
[1205.96 - 1212.20] the pan up on the stove so all these
[1209.16 - 1215.56] protocols using food and healing healing
[1212.20 - 1217.96] food and herbs have really created a new
[1215.56 - 1219.80] life for me can you talk about a little
[1217.96 - 1221.92] bit about the first protocols that you
[1219.80 - 1224.32] brought in where you really saw those
[1221.92 - 1225.68] changes especially with the joint pain I
[1224.32 - 1228.08] brought in a lot of protocols but it
[1225.68 - 1230.08] really wasn't until you eliminate those
[1228.08 - 1233.16] those brain betrayer Foods especially
[1230.08 - 1234.84] like canola oil so I I really did spent
[1233.16 - 1237.24] a lot of time in the kitchen PR prepping
[1234.84 - 1238.76] my food and bringing my food with me so
[1237.24 - 1241.60] that was really important to stay on
[1238.76 - 1243.76] track and not not deviate with the no
[1241.60 - 1245.96] Foods I also suffered from a caffeine
[1243.76 - 1249.12] addiction from chocolate I was a really
[1245.96 - 1251.68] big chocolate addict so eliminating that
[1249.12 - 1254.32] addiction and the need for caffeine was
[1251.68 - 1255.96] really helpful too did you feel that the
[1254.32 - 1257.72] more that you fueled your body with
[1255.96 - 1259.40] those nourishing foods and the protocols
[1257.72 - 1262.60] he recommended
[1259.40 - 1264.00] recommends it stopped those cravings for
[1262.60 - 1265.72] the chocolate and things like that in
[1264.00 - 1268.00] the brain in the Brain book he talks
[1265.72 - 1271.52] about the brain shots so and he has a
[1268.00 - 1273.24] craving shifter shot that's amazing so I
[1271.52 - 1275.20] did a lot of those I did a lot of brain
[1273.24 - 1277.64] shots and those are very
[1275.20 - 1279.44] helpful what's your one favorite thing
[1277.64 - 1283.20] about the medical medium
[1279.44 - 1285.20] information well I love it cuz it's free
[1283.20 - 1287.08] all the information is free Anthony
[1285.20 - 1288.60] delivers all this amazing information to
[1287.08 - 1290.96] us and it's right there at our
[1288.60 - 1293.24] fingertips the books do cost something
[1290.96 - 1295.60] but we they're encyclopedia books full
[1293.24 - 1296.76] color for I don't know how they I don't
[1295.60 - 1299.04] know how they're printing them for that
[1296.76 - 1301.32] price so get the books if you don't have
[1299.04 - 1303.32] the books but all on social media has
[1301.32 - 1304.56] everything free um there's lots of
[1303.32 - 1307.16] people in the community that want to
[1304.56 - 1309.00] help other people too which is so
[1307.16 - 1310.72] beautiful about the community what does
[1309.00 - 1312.40] it mean to you to be surrounded by all
[1310.72 - 1314.80] these beautiful people and to be at this
[1312.40 - 1317.00] event at Cafe Gratitude enjoying this
[1314.80 - 1319.52] pizza party in an environment that
[1317.00 - 1321.48] supports healing will you won't find

[1334.76 - 1339.08] much the the fact that you have been
[1336.52 - 1341.20] brave enough to share your story with
[1339.08 - 1343.88] everyone there was a lady I was speaking
[1341.20 - 1345.64] to last night and she shared her story
[1343.88 - 1348.32] and someone had the same symptoms who
[1345.64 - 1351.52] was watching online and they watched
[1348.32 - 1354.48] that over and over again for uh
[1351.52 - 1356.48] motivation and just it helped them on
[1354.48 - 1358.12] their healing journey by hearing that
[1356.48 - 1360.60] that person had used these methods to
[1358.12 - 1362.20] heal and it's just incredible right oh
[1360.60 - 1363.80] yeah it's incredible cuz your body does
[1362.20 - 1367.88] want to
[1363.80 - 1371.20] heal it does can you share an example of
[1367.88 - 1374.36] a specific memory of how your life was
[1371.20 - 1375.80] impacted from those uh health issues you
[1374.36 - 1378.08] were dealing with prior to Medical
[1375.80 - 1379.80] medium information well I couldn't be
[1378.08 - 1382.32] active
[1379.80 - 1386.68] so I couldn't I did a lot of laying down
[1382.32 - 1389.00] and resting resting my nerves um I was
[1386.68 - 1390.88] able to do enough to raise children and
[1389.00 - 1393.48] have it not be really noticeable that I
[1390.88 - 1396.28] was really had chronic fatigue but in
[1393.48 - 1397.72] the interim I would just rest a lot so I
[1396.28 - 1399.80] think just being active and being
[1397.72 - 1402.04] outside I'm able to get out in nature
[1399.80 - 1405.00] more and Anthony actually told me last
[1402.04 - 1407.28] night to get out of nature more but um
[1405.00 - 1411.32] which I love hiking and walking my dog
[1407.28 - 1413.32] so all those things have helped me be
[1411.32 - 1414.72] more active I do Pilates I play golf now
[1413.32 - 1416.64] I play pickle ball and I would never
[1414.72 - 1418.92] dream of be able to do any of those
[1416.64 - 1420.84] things prior do you have a new
[1418.92 - 1422.48] appreciation on being able to do those
[1420.84 - 1425.36] things after everything you've gone
[1422.48 - 1427.12] through absolutely because I try to have
[1425.36 - 1429.00] fun at those activities and not be
[1427.12 - 1430.52] competitive and want to win I'm just
[1429.00 - 1432.16] there to have fun because I know what
[1430.52 - 1434.52] it's like if I can't participate in
[1432.16 - 1435.96] those it's not fun at all so I try to
[1434.52 - 1438.96] have appreciation for the things I'm
[1435.96 - 1440.72] able to do now that's beautiful
[1438.96 - 1441.92] yeah yeah what was it that made you want

[1746.64 - 1751.16] for you yes so I'd love to share a
[1749.28 - 1752.88] little bit about your healing journey
[1751.16 - 1754.48] and how you discovered the medical
[1752.88 - 1757.96] medium
[1754.48 - 1760.24] information um well a few years ago I
[1757.96 - 1764.60] mean now I've been with medical medium
[1760.24 - 1768.76] for seven years um I you know I got sick
[1764.60 - 1771.48] when I was in my early 30s I sort of got
[1768.76 - 1774.20] some I mean some healing because I
[1771.48 - 1777.64] followed some diets here and there I
[1774.20 - 1781.20] mean no Dairy no gluten you know the
[1777.64 - 1784.08] usual and that helped me a lot and you
[1781.20 - 1787.52] know ups and down a lot lots of
[1784.08 - 1789.72] traumatic things have happened uh so and
[1787.52 - 1793.72] I was still I mean for the last 30 I'm
[1789.72 - 1797.28] 67 for the last 30 years also I've been
[1793.72 - 1799.72] looking for to to Really heal and I was
[1797.28 - 1803.68] going down onwards because of some
[1799.72 - 1807.52] addictions and and I was I you know you
[1803.68 - 1813.20] you named the uh the the methods I've
[1807.52 - 1816.36] tried all of them uh nutrition uh yoga
[1813.20 - 1819.60] all of it uh I've tried it and I've read
[1816.36 - 1822.04] many many books like everybody does and
[1819.60 - 1824.52] Anthony mentions that a lot there's a
[1822.04 - 1828.36] journey that we all go through and then
[1824.52 - 1831.96] we we try different things and we go see
[1828.36 - 1834.52] different doctors naturopath osteopath
[1831.96 - 1837.32] Al theath we we try all of them and we
[1834.52 - 1840.00] spend Fortune doing all of that and I
[1837.32 - 1843.44] was also trying to not not only healing
[1840.00 - 1846.60] myself but healing uh one of my sisters
[1843.44 - 1850.04] that was uh that was uh whose he was
[1846.60 - 1853.16] declining and she had no help uh really
[1850.04 - 1858.00] from the medical community so uh I was
[1853.16 - 1860.80] trying also to to help her and uh I some
[1858.00 - 1862.64] naturopath mentioned that book I mean
[1860.80 - 1866.56] she funny enough she didn't really
[1862.64 - 1868.72] follow it but she mentioned it uh so but
[1866.56 - 1871.00] I learned it was you know it was a man
[1868.72 - 1873.12] talking to a spirit so I didn't want to
[1871.00 - 1877.40] read that type of book
[1873.12 - 1881.28] again for another you know for the ex
[1877.40 - 1883.68] number of time so I you know I didn't I
[1881.28 - 1885.76] didn't follow up on it but I happened to
[1883.68 - 1888.24] see an interview with Anthony on
[1885.76 - 1892.12] Entertainment Tonight I believe it was
[1888.24 - 1896.48] MH and uh that's what hooked me because
[1892.12 - 1898.92] what he said was um made sense made made
[1896.48 - 1901.48] a lot of sense to me and then I I got
[1898.92 - 1905.00] his first book and I read it and made a
[1901.48 - 1907.00] lot of sense from what I had gone
[1905.00 - 1909.04] through for what my sister had gone
[1907.00 - 1912.44] through uh and
[1909.04 - 1915.68] observing uh people around me uh from
[1912.44 - 1918.48] far or from AF far from a closer uh what
[1915.68 - 1921.76] they what their journey in into uh
[1918.48 - 1926.80] disease is it made a lot of sense to
[1921.76 - 1929.36] me um so uh I started celery juice and
[1926.80 - 1935.16] it's hard the first the first few years
[1929.36 - 1938.80] because you you have to to uh change
[1935.16 - 1941.16] everything um I mean I was lucky because
[1938.80 - 1943.36] already I was uh dairy free and
[1941.16 - 1946.00] glutenfree but you know you fall off the
[1943.36 - 1947.44] wagon you you get depressed and then you
[1946.00 - 1950.48] you know there's always this back and
[1947.44 - 1952.64] forth going on and uh watching his
[1950.48 - 1958.12] videos and reading the books uh helped
[1952.64 - 1960.60] me get get on track and um and
[1958.12 - 1962.92] uh you know it was hard at first also
[1960.60 - 1965.08] because you're sick and I was sick so
[1962.92 - 1967.52] you're very tired and you're depressed
[1965.08 - 1970.20] and uh brain fog you're
[1967.52 - 1973.16] confused uh you have all these symptoms
[1970.20 - 1975.60] I had menopause symptoms I had chronic
[1973.16 - 1979.48] sinusitis uh you know I would go to the
[1975.60 - 1982.72] emergency uh not being able to breathe
[1979.48 - 1985.16] either you know it it was accumulating a
[1982.72 - 1989.04] lot so you it's it's hard to go through
[1985.16 - 1991.64] that and then and still uh hold on to
[1989.04 - 1993.80] any method really but I held on to that
[1991.64 - 1996.88] one because it was working it was really
[1993.80 - 2000.16] helping and it felt very fresh and the
[1996.88 - 2003.20] the um all the explanation about it
[2000.16 - 2005.68] sounded very uh made a lot of sense to
[2003.20 - 2009.60] me so unfortunately I couldn't help my
[2005.68 - 2011.32] sister she passed away
[2009.60 - 2013.08] thank
[2011.32 - 2016.12] you
[2013.08 - 2017.84] so I kept going it's still hard to think
[2016.12 - 2020.84] about
[2017.84 - 2020.84] her
[2021.72 - 2028.48] so what was hard just to see her go and
[2026.60 - 2032.04] I wish I could have helped
[2028.48 - 2037.56] her better and I've
[2032.04 - 2040.76] known medical medium before but you know
[2037.56 - 2043.56] like life is such that the way things
[2040.76 - 2047.56] happen it happened that way so but so I
[2043.56 - 2050.20] kept going and I keep going for her and
[2047.56 - 2052.96] for me beautiful that's so beautiful and
[2050.20 - 2055.44] now you're sharing this deeply moving
[2052.96 - 2057.68] story with everyone watching online and

[2057.68 - 2065.28] beautiful I I hope so I do want to help

[2892.80 - 2899.32] fortunate I didn't really start in a
[2894.80 - 2902.48] place of um uh major crisis so I use it

[2952.80 - 2956.00] and just different ways I can
[2954.36 - 2959.24] incorporate even pieces of the
[2956.00 - 2961.84] information in other people's plans and
[2959.24 - 2965.96] uh see how um powerful it can be when

[2978.40 - 2982.48] pass on the message and pass on the
[2980.88 - 2985.28] information to help others so everyone's
[2982.48 - 2986.52] healing together absolutely yes and of
[2985.28 - 2988.60] course they they need to be open and
[2986.52 - 2991.00] receptive so it's always I wait for the

[2991.00 - 2996.68] moment to introduce a piece of it um

[3122.72 - 3128.04] of this was about 14 years ago and one
[3125.28 - 3129.96] of the um one of the other therapists we

[3129.96 - 3135.80] in at that like lime clients coming in
[3131.64 - 3138.92] at that time and um one of the Bri one
[3135.80 - 3141.68] of the other therapists sent me a um the
[3138.92 - 3145.20] goop article that the first goop article
[3141.68 - 3148.08] on lime and my jaw just kind of dropped

[3518.44 - 3522.60] using medical medium
[3520.40 - 3525.24] information well I probably have a
[3522.60 - 3527.08] pretty unique story because I've been
[3525.24 - 3529.76] suffering wait I don't like the word
[3527.08 - 3531.84] suffering I'm going to say I have been
[3529.76 - 3535.40] challenged by
[3531.84 - 3538.12] PTSD for a little over seven years and
[3535.40 - 3540.80] um it was it's a pretty extreme event my
[3538.12 - 3544.48] family was killed in a mass shooting and
[3540.80 - 3547.76] 10 people died 26 people died but 10 of
[3544.48 - 3551.72] them were my family oh my God and so
[3547.76 - 3555.84] yeah it thank you but anyway I I mean
[3551.72 - 3558.24] you know um it happened like my dad
[3555.84 - 3562.60] said I don't know if I can say this he
[3558.24 - 3567.28] just died a few days ago but um anyway
[3562.60 - 3569.04] he said um what today is today and what
[3567.28 - 3570.96] happened happened and we don't like what
[3569.04 - 3573.76] happened but I
[3570.96 - 3574.84] know I know how the story goes and it
[3573.76 - 3578.44] ends
[3574.84 - 3580.84] good so
[3578.44 - 3582.16] beautiful sorry I didn't know I was
[3580.84 - 3585.48] going to say
[3582.16 - 3587.36] that anyway so um but I hadn't been able
[3585.48 - 3589.64] to sleep and I've been having panic
[3587.36 - 3591.44] attacks and and my adrenal glands are
[3589.64 - 3593.56] waking me up in the middle of the night
[3591.44 - 3596.80] and shooting out adrenaline and then I'm
[3593.56 - 3598.44] so wak up I never was sleeping and we
[3596.80 - 3600.84] were all my friend Karen and I were
[3598.44 - 3602.60] already buddies but you know I was
[3600.84 - 3604.20] telling her about that and she goes well
[3602.60 - 3606.96] have you done the celery juice thing and
[3604.20 - 3608.40] I I said well no I really haven't and so
[3606.96 - 3610.24] she said okay well I'm going to start
[3608.40 - 3614.04] making you celery juice for a while and
[3610.24 - 3618.00] then and then um the heavy metal
[3614.04 - 3620.08] smoothies and then and then we'll um see
[3618.00 - 3621.92] how you like that and before that like I
[3620.08 - 3624.84] was like already going to get celery
[3621.92 - 3627.16] juice before before she made it for me
[3624.84 - 3630.32] cuz I couldn't wait and I was doing it
[3627.16 - 3633.16] every day and gradually I okay this is
[3630.32 - 3635.84] the biggest thing you know I I I slept 5
[3633.16 - 3639.60] hours at a time once I hadn't done that
[3635.84 - 3642.12] in over seven years and um now see my
[3639.60 - 3644.52] mind freezes so that's one of the things
[3642.12 - 3648.84] that's actually it was better until my
[3644.52 - 3653.44] dad died so I'm a little bit but um okay
[3648.84 - 3656.16] so um I also was able to fall asleep
[3653.44 - 3658.36] without listening to something because
[3656.16 - 3661.24] when I don't listen I think about what
[3658.36 - 3663.04] happened but now I can just close my
[3661.24 - 3665.32] eyes and go to sleep
[3663.04 - 3668.00] peacefully I'm a little bit I'm a little
[3665.32 - 3670.00] bit discombobulated from the current
[3668.00 - 3671.68] things that anyway that's okay you're
[3670.00 - 3673.44] doing amazing you're doing great thank

[3677.80 - 3681.24] have like a long-term plan but I'm doing
[3679.64 - 3683.48] it one step at a time so I don't get
[3681.24 - 3684.96] overwhelmed cuz everything overwhelms me
[3683.48 - 3686.44] right now but that's okay and one step
[3684.96 - 3688.48] at a time is great
[3686.44 - 3690.44] and I mean just the celery juice the

[3861.20 - 3866.28] developed like a bloating feeling
[3864.04 - 3869.12] discomfort and she
[3866.28 - 3872.32] we took her to several doctors even the
[3869.12 - 3874.84] several uh primary physicians to get a
[3872.32 - 3876.28] second opinion and the second doctor
[3874.84 - 3879.00] told us
[3876.28 - 3881.76] like she said we don't know what your
[3879.00 - 3884.12] symptom is or you're diagnosed or can
[3881.76 - 3886.84] anything to help you but if you find
[3884.12 - 3889.44] with the answer come back and see me and
[3886.84 - 3893.60] I was like okay so I started researching
[3889.44 - 3897.24] online and then I found a a psychiatrist
[3893.60 - 3899.76] on the one of the online events and she
[3897.24 - 3903.20] said something with it's maybe cuz we
[3899.76 - 3905.52] tested her for every like um the colons
[3903.20 - 3908.00] and everything and nothing was like
[3905.52 - 3909.80] everything was normal so she was still
[3908.00 - 3912.88] belching and had the bloating feeling on
[3909.80 - 3915.36] and off it goes up and down so finally
[3912.88 - 3918.48] um I found an online lady that said that
[3915.36 - 3921.28] it's could be related to anxiety and
[3918.48 - 3923.64] causes like a a tightness in the air and
[3921.28 - 3926.16] breathing and everything so then I still
[3923.64 - 3930.16] was researching about anxiety and I came
[3926.16 - 3932.00] up on a medical medium on Facebook with
[3930.16 - 3933.52] one of the I I've seen it before but I
[3932.00 - 3935.92] never really looked into it because I
[3933.52 - 3937.84] always see the flashes and finally I did
[3935.92 - 3941.40] a research and I didn't even know he had
[3937.84 - 3944.08] like a uh what is it called all these
[3941.40 - 3947.20] books and podcasts and even their own
[3944.08 - 3950.20] website so as I started more research I
[3947.20 - 3952.56] found deeper into understanding it and I
[3950.20 - 3956.40] started putting my mom on the celery
[3952.56 - 3959.48] juice and and also um the lemon water
[3956.40 - 3962.40] and the morning cleanse and after that
[3959.48 - 3965.56] she started healing with her belching
[3962.40 - 3968.00] stopped and then her also anxiety and
[3965.56 - 3971.68] depression started to
[3968.00 - 3975.60] fade yeah and then we were here last uh
[3971.68 - 3977.92] summer during the Culver City so we had
[3975.60 - 3982.00] the blast and after that it jump started
[3977.92 - 3984.28] me into um giving me a boost into I did
[3982.00 - 3985.96] the 28 day cleanse right after I got
[3984.28 - 3988.68] back for some reason it just like
[3985.96 - 3991.52] brought me into like this higher Spirit
[3988.68 - 3994.60] of doing it for myself because um the
[3991.52 - 3998.60] only thing that really bothered me was I
[3994.60 - 4000.84] had acne so I did the the 28 day cleanse
[3998.60 - 4003.48] and it healed my acne as well too are
[4000.84 - 4004.84] there any other um notices that you felt
[4003.48 - 4006.92] you know health benefits that you
[4004.84 - 4008.72] noticed after doing that 28 day cleanse
[4006.92 - 4010.44] that you may not have been going into
[4008.72 - 4014.60] the cleanse to heal but it just happened
[4010.44 - 4017.00] anyway yes a lot I had my brain started
[4014.60 - 4019.20] going faster was shooting faster the way
[4017.00 - 4022.52] I think and talk and everything and then
[4019.20 - 4025.12] also um I was feeling a lot happier too
[4022.52 - 4027.24] I guess I had a little slight anxiety as
[4025.12 - 4029.80] well because I was helping my mom and
[4027.24 - 4031.44] dealing with her her anxiety her
[4029.80 - 4034.00] depression so I was like oh this will
[4031.44 - 4036.08] helped me as well so we both came on
[4034.00 - 4039.24] together through the same journey and we
[4036.08 - 4041.28] both benefited so both hailing together
[4039.24 - 4042.84] yes and my mom is like the most
[4041.28 - 4046.00] important person in my life so that's
[4042.84 - 4048.12] why I wanted to make sure she heals and
[4046.00 - 4050.32] be happy that's so beautiful that you
[4048.12 - 4052.48] went into into this helping your mom
[4050.32 - 4056.40] with such a pure heart and then you end
[4052.48 - 4058.36] up healing as well yes yes and so I'm in
[4056.40 - 4060.52] I'm from Vegas so there's a lot of
[4058.36 - 4062.92] people I work with also they have their
[4060.52 - 4065.24] symptoms so then I'm also helping them
[4062.92 - 4067.40] like heal with certain telling them what
[4065.24 - 4069.84] to eat and they're starting to also heal
[4067.40 - 4072.56] and do the lemon water and the celery
[4069.84 - 4075.24] juice as well so it's like it becoming
[4072.56 - 4078.36] like now they look at me like I'm like
[4075.24 - 4080.36] the person to help them also and I keep
[4078.36 - 4082.08] referring everyone to go to Medical
[4080.36 - 4085.52] medium and Anthony
[4082.08 - 4088.28] Williams to find out more but a lot of
[4085.52 - 4091.04] them I think they're just too lazy to go
[4088.28 - 4093.80] research on their own and read and so
[4091.04 - 4095.44] they they account me to do it depend on
[4093.80 - 4097.64] me to do it and then they just listen to
[4095.44 - 4099.76] me but I gave them all the information
[4097.64 - 4101.88] and where is at to show them how to find
[4099.76 - 4103.36] the information as well but that's okay
[4101.88 - 4104.84] I think everyone it comes at you know
[4103.36 - 4106.32] when it's the right time for them as
[4104.84 - 4108.20] well but they'll see you and you'll
[4106.32 - 4112.04] Inspire them you know like you already
[4108.20 - 4113.36] are yeah it's beautiful what are some of
[4112.04 - 4115.60] your favorite parts of the medical
[4113.36 - 4117.48] medium information the favorite favorite
[4115.60 - 4120.16] parts of the medical medium information
[4117.48 - 4123.00] oh man favorite part I I really find I
[4120.16 - 4126.60] listen to his uh podcast a lot and just
[4123.00 - 4129.52] listening to his stories and all the
[4126.60 - 4132.32] information relates to how I'm thinking
[4129.52 - 4133.84] so it's the same mindset like I've
[4132.32 - 4135.84] because I always been in the health
[4133.84 - 4137.68] industry testing a lot of supplements
[4135.84 - 4140.68] and everything but I didn't know exactly
[4137.68 - 4143.16] like what's the proper the right way
[4140.68 - 4145.52] which one is good for you and my mom was
[4143.16 - 4148.96] taking collagen too this was the part
[4145.52 - 4151.44] that really also helped and she uh we
[4148.96 - 4153.84] took her to get a lung CTI chest x-ray
[4151.44 - 4157.24] and they found um what is it called
[4153.84 - 4159.48] nodules in her chest right in her lungs
[4157.24 - 4161.28] so as after that all we started doing
[4159.48 - 4164.08] the cleanse and I think we went and got
[4161.28 - 4166.64] back a retest 6 months later and it went
[4164.08 - 4168.28] away too that how we knew and because we
[4166.64 - 4171.00] stopped the collagen I think it was the
[4168.28 - 4173.40] collagen that she was taking non-stop in
[4171.00 - 4175.20] a lot of collagens cuz she thinks it's
[4173.40 - 4177.84] good for her skin a lot of people take
[4175.20 - 4180.48] that for their skin yeah they don't nor
[4177.84 - 4183.00] right so I we I stopped it from reading
[4180.48 - 4184.88] the celery book I have the celery juice
[4183.00 - 4186.84] book and it said no collagen on there
[4184.88 - 4190.32] that's how I found out and I told my mom
[4186.84 - 4191.96] to stop immediately and then after that
[4190.32 - 4195.96] uh 6 months later we went back for the
[4191.96 - 4201.08] CT scan and her her nodules went away
[4195.96 - 4201.08] too that's incredible that's huge
[4201.80 - 4207.68] yeah yeah even her stomach the bloating
[4204.60 - 4210.56] everything went away even and The Poets
[4207.68 - 4215.56] too she got a colonoscopy all the pops
[4210.56 - 4217.32] are gone as well w wow H and this is
[4215.56 - 4220.80] only within like we just started last
[4217.32 - 4222.88] summer since cover City this was our
[4220.80 - 4224.16] journey so that's why now we're just
[4222.88 - 4226.84] excited to be
[4224.16 - 4228.44] here and on top of that not just the
[4226.84 - 4231.60] healing and the health benefits I love
[4228.44 - 4234.36] anony Williams passion and the the way
[4231.60 - 4237.68] he teaches like us to believe in
[4234.36 - 4241.04] ourselves and give us hope to help
[4237.68 - 4243.36] ourself you know and that it he teaches
[4241.04 - 4244.64] us to love life again and love one
[4243.36 - 4247.80] another that
[4244.64 - 4250.72] compassion it's just everything that
[4247.80 - 4252.44] I've that's like who I was before too
[4250.72 - 4254.28] it's just around the people sometimes
[4252.44 - 4256.84] where you work or you run into a lot of
[4254.28 - 4258.72] people those energies kind of drain you
[4256.84 - 4260.56] and pull you down but with Anthony
[4258.72 - 4263.04] William it's the opposite he gives back
[4260.56 - 4266.56] the energy to help us uplift and become
[4263.04 - 4269.36] who we truly are so that's what I like
[4266.56 - 4270.76] about the medical medium community no
[4269.36 - 4273.08] it's incredible and a lot of people talk
[4270.76 - 4274.96] about their healing Journey being one
[4273.08 - 4277.28] that where they're healing their health
[4274.96 - 4280.20] but also very spiritual did you have any
[4277.28 - 4282.08] spiritual lessons I certainly did after
[4280.20 - 4284.40] my 28 day cleanse it's just like they
[4282.08 - 4286.60] were saying in the book it was almost
[4284.40 - 4289.08] like going backwards I was going reverse
[4286.60 - 4291.56] like back to my 20s and then high school
[4289.08 - 4295.00] I had all these memories like all these
[4291.56 - 4297.04] uh almost not trauma but the discomfort
[4295.00 - 4299.68] it slowly like came out and it just
[4297.04 - 4302.32] keeps loosening and fading away and I
[4299.68 - 4305.24] was like wanted to keep going on this
[4302.32 - 4308.44] spiritual journey with the after the 28
[4305.24 - 4310.04] day cleanse and so even today I'm still
[4308.44 - 4313.96] I'm excited about the spiritual book
[4310.04 - 4315.80] coming out for in March March March 18
[4313.96 - 4319.32] all right all right we know the date
[4315.80 - 4320.84] we're excited yeah so thank you so much
[4319.32 - 4322.68] and isn't your mom so lucky to have you
[4320.84 - 4324.84] to introduce you to all this incredible
[4322.68 - 4327.00] information from medical media you know
[4324.84 - 4329.72] before the medical I was praying and
[4327.00 - 4331.68] praying to the upper realm to help my
[4329.72 - 4333.84] mom and then all of a sudden it just
[4331.68 - 4336.16] came I feel like medic like Anthony just
[4333.84 - 4338.28] answered our prayers and because I know
[4336.16 - 4340.56] a lot of people run into medical medium
[4338.28 - 4343.36] on Facebook and social media but it's
[4340.56 - 4345.72] not in their head yet it's like it has
[4343.36 - 4348.76] to like grasp you for you to catch it
[4345.72 - 4353.44] not anybody can just accept it so it
[4348.76 - 4356.08] takes a type of um I don't know like a
[4353.44 - 4358.68] um like you have an Infinity with it to
[4356.08 - 4361.40] for them to reach out and just grab you
[4358.68 - 4363.48] to accept it it's not that easy so it's
[4361.40 - 4366.88] almost like a pebble sand in the big
[4363.48 - 4369.36] vast river that you know you can accept
[4366.88 - 4372.08] this kind of learning and teaching and
[4369.36 - 4373.96] stuff so really well uh we're still

[4700.60 - 4707.76] lot of um digestive issues skin issues
[4705.20 - 4709.52] um it's just headaches I mean it's hard
[4707.76 - 4712.24] to remember all the symptoms I used to
[4709.52 - 4714.32] have that I no longer have and the heavy
[4712.24 - 4717.48] metal detox I've been really good about

[4722.04 - 4726.44] different protocols I have all sorts of
[4724.24 - 4731.08] things to work on so I just kind of
[4726.44 - 4731.08] shift focus and but it's great to get
[4734.92 - 4739.20] about the medical medium information you
[4736.52 - 4740.88] would like to share you know I just love
[4739.20 - 4742.36] that anything that you're going through
[4740.88 - 4744.48] like you know I have kids too and one of
[4742.36 - 4746.44] my son has been diagnosed with different
[4744.48 - 4749.04] things and instead of looking for that
[4746.44 - 4751.32] in in medicine looking through that in
[4749.04 - 4752.52] food and healing and I feel like also as
[4751.32 - 4753.28] being a single mom there's so much on
[4752.52 - 4755.00] her plate and there's so much
[4753.28 - 4756.68] information and Miss confusion out there
[4755.00 - 4758.04] and to be able to have someone who says
[4756.68 - 4759.60] let's do it in a way we're not putting
[4758.04 - 4762.04] junk in our bodies we're putting
[4759.60 - 4764.04] something healing in our bodies um his
[4762.04 - 4765.80] recipe books are go-to for me I love to
[4764.04 - 4767.56] make those things and have food to go to
[4765.80 - 4768.84] to eat throughout the week um and then
[4767.56 - 4770.36] just this positive attitude on
[4768.84 - 4772.00] everything like when I go on my feet and
[4770.36 - 4773.80] I see him he's always talking about
[4772.00 - 4775.44] something that I could help you know in
[4773.80 - 4778.24] better in your situation whether it's
[4775.44 - 4780.20] mental physical emotional it's just like
[4778.24 - 4781.80] from top to bottom he's got you you know
[4780.20 - 4783.36] I love that I love all of it I mean
[4781.80 - 4784.96] there's there's no one thing it's just
[4783.36 - 4787.00] and like I said when I meet people that
[4784.96 - 4791.28] are like-minded it's just the energy is
[4787.00 - 4792.92] just so alive and and um supportive and
[4791.28 - 4795.36] loving and I just love to be around
[4792.92 - 4797.40] people like that so yeah so many things

[5826.80 - 5831.56] medium information how long have you
[5828.36 - 5834.24] been using it for um my mom got me into
[5831.56 - 5837.28] it um I've been doing it for about 5
[5834.24 - 5839.80] years now and then I started in
[5837.28 - 5842.16] 2018 like when his right after his first
[5839.80 - 5844.76] book came out is when I started reading
[5842.16 - 5846.84] and dabbling into it so what compelled
[5844.76 - 5849.48] you to get into this what were you going
[5846.84 - 5851.56] through at the time um I had eczema that
[5849.48 - 5852.76] had just spurred all of a sudden and I
[5851.56 - 5854.16] didn't know how to get rid of it I had
[5852.76 - 5855.84] seen so many different doctors and
[5854.16 - 5858.24] dermatologists and nobody could get rid
[5855.84 - 5861.48] of it so I was interested in seeing if I
[5858.24 - 5864.00] could help that was initial and then why
[5861.48 - 5866.68] share it with your daughter she had some
[5864.00 - 5869.12] really weird H situations that I just
[5866.68 - 5870.84] like we don't know what was going on so
[5869.12 - 5872.68] a l thankful that it was able to help
[5870.84 - 5876.56] her I mean that's even more important to
[5872.68 - 5878.96] me that helped you and not just
[5876.56 - 5881.80] me yeah I had a lot of like heart
[5878.96 - 5884.08] palpitations and anxiety and stuff and
[5881.80 - 5886.08] my anxiety is almost gone now heart
[5884.08 - 5888.32] palpitations are a lot better ever since
[5886.08 - 5890.60] I started doing it so just feel
[5888.32 - 5891.92] healthier overall so it's great that's
[5890.60 - 5894.64] incredible and what are some of your
[5891.92 - 5896.80] favorite things about the protocol I
[5894.64 - 5899.28] personally love the celery
[5896.80 - 5900.88] juice yeah it is good it's refreshing
[5899.28 - 5904.08] and it's just a great way to start the
[5900.88 - 5905.72] day yeah and did you stop just with the
[5904.08 - 5908.08] celery juice or how did you start
[5905.72 - 5910.12] implementing things mine was just celery
[5908.08 - 5912.48] juice at first and then heavy metal
[5910.12 - 5914.12] detox smoothie and then slowly adding
[5912.48 - 5915.56] things in and it's just it's really
[5914.12 - 5917.40] interesting to see how your taste buds
[5915.56 - 5919.76] Chang and all of a sudden vegetables are

[5921.92 - 5926.04] and tastes better than it used to
[5924.08 - 5928.00] because your taste buds
[5926.04 - 5929.56] change and then can you talk a little
[5928.00 - 5931.72] bit more in depth about your health
[5929.56 - 5933.72] benefits that you experienced uh using
[5931.72 - 5936.04] the medical medium information mhm well
[5933.72 - 5938.04] I had developed anxiety and I didn't I
[5936.04 - 5939.84] had no idea why and looking back I think
[5938.04 - 5943.84] it was related to me taking out some
[5939.84 - 5946.32] metal cavities merre cavities so um that
[5943.84 - 5948.44] went went away like 95% so that was
[5946.32 - 5950.00] really awesome and it was just weird I
[5948.44 - 5952.24] would get so anxious and I didn't know
[5950.00 - 5953.92] why and then it just all went away and
[5952.24 - 5957.04] then right when I started the protocols
[5953.92 - 5959.88] I was um just starting to need readers
[5957.04 - 5961.56] for vision and then uh with doing the
[5959.88 - 5963.68] heavy metal detox then I no longer
[5961.56 - 5965.56] needed them so I never really had to use
[5963.68 - 5968.24] them so my eyes just improved just
[5965.56 - 5969.88] enough where I don't need them I mean I
[5968.24 - 5972.76] do use contacts for far away but I don't
[5969.88 - 5974.36] need readers so that's incredible yeah
[5972.76 - 5975.88] so that was really exciting do you have
[5974.36 - 5978.24] an encouraging message you would like to
[5975.88 - 5981.48] share with the community watching
[5978.24 - 5983.04] online um I mean just start somewhere
[5981.48 - 5985.72] and then you'll eventually start to see
[5983.04 - 5988.88] the benefits and I mean it can't hurt
[5985.72 - 5990.60] you so yeah yeah it's really special
[5988.88 - 5992.32] when you start to see some small changes

[6126.88 - 6133.12] 2016 I had uh a breakdown in 2014 in
[6131.00 - 6135.48] January like I I couldn't function
[6133.12 - 6137.00] anymore I was like on metress island I
[6135.48 - 6139.80] didn't know what was wrong with me I
[6137.00 - 6142.28] tried you know the whole story I tried
[6139.80 - 6144.60] everything I I have like this big of a
[6142.28 - 6147.88] pile of like medical records of
[6144.60 - 6151.64] alternative medic Med medicine I had my
[6147.88 - 6153.04] teeth uh I had my my my my jaws drilled
[6151.64 - 6154.72] because I thought maybe it's from there
[6153.04 - 6157.24] I had an heart inflammation and nobody
[6154.72 - 6158.76] took it serious it was really horrible I
[6157.24 - 6161.44] thought I was going to die and I think I
[6158.76 - 6162.16] would have died and I had serious you
[6161.44 - 6165.80] know
[6162.16 - 6168.60] also neurological self going on panic
[6165.80 - 6170.00] attacks as well and I was so miserable
[6168.60 - 6172.52] and the worst thing was that I had a
[6170.00 - 6175.20] child I had a young child and that's how
[6172.52 - 6177.88] it you know with heavy metals so he was
[6175.20 - 6180.52] very like he cried a lot as an infant
[6177.88 - 6181.24] and that really I'm a single mom and
[6180.52 - 6184.60] that
[6181.24 - 6186.80] really pushed me off the cliff I tried
[6184.60 - 6189.48] to recover I didn't know I did all the
[6186.80 - 6191.48] things wrong like I went on a keto diet
[6189.48 - 6194.28] at the end because I was like okay maybe
[6191.48 - 6196.80] it's the sugars I eating way too much
[6194.28 - 6198.72] sugars so I cut the sugars out and there
[6196.80 - 6201.68] was they gave me the last push Chuck
[6198.72 - 6203.56] that was it I I just grumbled and
[6201.68 - 6206.72] nothing went and I had to to give him to
[6203.56 - 6208.96] my parents you know he was like three
[6206.72 - 6210.68] four years old and I couldn't function
[6208.96 - 6212.00] anymore it's really horrible it's a
[6210.68 - 6213.80] really horrible time and you know we
[6212.00 - 6217.40] suffered so
[6213.80 - 6219.44] much and then 2016 I discovered Anthony
[6217.40 - 6222.00] I did a lot of things before that we
[6219.44 - 6223.32] already in line I took supplements for
[6222.00 - 6225.16] the first time in my life before it's
[6223.32 - 6228.80] like vitamin C artificial like I'm never
[6225.16 - 6230.32] going to take as corbic acid never so
[6228.80 - 6232.00] then I was like okay you might I might
[6230.32 - 6233.72] as well try this and then I just look
[6232.00 - 6236.04] for the best one and
[6233.72 - 6238.44] I had like other supplements that now I
[6236.04 - 6240.92] know were coming from my com medium and
[6238.44 - 6243.68] somebody told me oh I think you have um
[6240.92 - 6245.36] um adrenal issues as well because you
[6243.68 - 6247.40] know I had to get up in Wake up in the
[6245.36 - 6250.04] in the night because my baby was crying
[6247.40 - 6253.56] like 16 times at night and yelling in my
[6250.04 - 6256.40] ear and as was like what what oh okay my
[6253.56 - 6259.00] baby so you know my my adrenals were
[6256.40 - 6261.00] like gone because this was went on for
[6259.00 - 6263.36] years that I was so stressed out I
[6261.00 - 6266.84] couldn't sleep anymore cuz it took came
[6263.36 - 6269.52] so long to fall asleep that I just I was
[6266.84 - 6270.92] a mess and my adrenals were a mess I
[6269.52 - 6272.80] thought I was going to die next moment
[6270.92 - 6276.16] and I took you know ashwaganda for
[6272.80 - 6278.68] example I got this book on adrenal
[6276.16 - 6280.56] fatigue and I know now that everything
[6278.68 - 6282.52] was inspired by medical medium of course
[6280.56 - 6285.68] where did they know that ashwaganda
[6282.52 - 6287.96] ashwag is for the you know I took but I
[6285.68 - 6290.32] took all these supplements how do you
[6287.96 - 6293.72] call it this this adrenal from cows I
[6290.32 - 6297.04] took I took liver cow's liver
[6293.72 - 6300.28] I did everything my vitamin D high do I
[6297.04 - 6302.64] did the B12 shots I did everything I
[6300.28 - 6305.12] could get my hands on and nothing worked
[6302.64 - 6308.52] at the end I did gon Gerson Therapy is
[6305.12 - 6312.00] like a you know so I resonated with that
[6308.52 - 6314.36] and they took also B12 andum um I
[6312.00 - 6316.24] whatever I I took I was in line with
[6314.36 - 6318.40] doing at all yes I was doing that and I
[6316.24 - 6319.96] was just the coffee Animas like already
[6318.40 - 6322.00] hard this heart inflammation like this
[6319.96 - 6323.92] low grain infection and I could not
[6322.00 - 6325.88] tolerate it I like was going to have a
[6323.92 - 6328.36] heart attack so I stopped the thank
[6325.88 - 6329.96] goodness I stopped these coffee Animas
[6328.36 - 6332.08] because now we know from medical medium
[6329.96 - 6334.76] this is like really damaging for the
[6332.08 - 6337.20] liver that's the nervous system whatever
[6334.76 - 6338.96] I guess too so I I did this and people
[6337.20 - 6341.44] were telling me why do you do GS and you
[6338.96 - 6344.36] don't have cancer I'm like yeah but what
[6341.44 - 6345.84] do I do I don't know what to do well
[6344.36 - 6347.64] something's wrong like seriously and I
[6345.84 - 6349.20] don't know what it is and no doctor
[6347.64 - 6351.68] believes me they all say yeah you're
[6349.20 - 6353.56] crazy you know it's just like drawer put
[6351.68 - 6356.80] me in the drawer and
[6353.56 - 6359.60] so yeah so I found him online one night
[6356.80 - 6361.12] because I went to get my jaws like
[6359.60 - 6362.80] excavated because I thought maybe
[6361.12 - 6366.48] there's an infection in the gum cuz I
[6362.80 - 6368.36] had also serious pain jaw pain and the
[6366.48 - 6370.96] that dentist I went three times to have
[6368.36 - 6373.56] like riew serious surgery and he said
[6370.96 - 6375.20] you won't get uh you won't get better
[6373.56 - 6378.00] until you have every all the teeth
[6375.20 - 6380.88] removed I was like all right then I have
[6378.00 - 6382.28] like all my teeth removed I I would have
[6380.88 - 6384.24] I was like but wait you know I'm I'm
[6382.28 - 6386.16] still looking on I'm still looking and
[6384.24 - 6389.20] thankfully I have like my last in my
[6386.16 - 6391.44] front that I kept yeah and I found
[6389.20 - 6394.12] medical medium and I and there was a
[6391.44 - 6396.36] lady sitting next to me like I'm I'm on
[6394.12 - 6397.76] uh if you can't work anymore how is it
[6396.36 - 6399.84] called again like a disability yes I'm
[6397.76 - 6401.80] on disability because of Epstein bar
[6399.84 - 6404.48] virus and before that I went to a
[6401.80 - 6409.24] practitioner he diagnosed me with
[6404.48 - 6411.52] some whatever methods EP bar was among
[6409.24 - 6413.20] other things like EP bar is all right
[6411.52 - 6416.52] and then when she told me that's the
[6413.20 - 6418.08] reason why she was this disabled like oh
[6416.52 - 6421.32] this must be serious I'm going to look
[6418.08 - 6424.40] into it so one night I went on the
[6421.32 - 6426.32] internet AB Ste bar virus I Googled it
[6424.40 - 6428.56] and I found Anthony's book Anthony's
[6426.32 - 6430.24] website I'm like this is like weird
[6428.56 - 6432.60] picture there's this lady lying in this
[6430.24 - 6436.00] lawn I was like oh this is very American
[6432.60 - 6438.24] but somehow something attracted
[6436.00 - 6441.52] me I mean I was
[6438.24 - 6443.24] praying Jesus Mary God you know help me
[6441.52 - 6445.84] find something I need some something I
[6443.24 - 6447.12] can't go like this anymore so then I
[6445.84 - 6449.56] don't know a couple of weeks later
[6447.12 - 6451.92] probably I found this website I found
[6449.56 - 6453.80] Anthony and this book had just come out
[6451.92 - 6455.12] in German too the first book and I
[6453.80 - 6457.04] ordered it in English because I didn't
[6455.12 - 6459.64] have much money it was cheaper thank God
[6457.04 - 6462.20] I did because the German translation is
[6459.64 - 6463.88] really oh no it's horrible that book my
[6462.20 - 6467.12] mom later got it in German the first
[6463.88 - 6468.84] book horrible whatever so I took the ger
[6467.12 - 6470.80] book I got the English version I open it
[6468.84 - 6473.16] I'm like okay that's it you know I doing
[6470.80 - 6475.08] I'm doing everything I did right I was
[6473.16 - 6476.88] already juicing because of G on I had
[6475.08 - 6479.36] all the tools I had the vitamins for my
[6476.88 - 6481.72] mom cuz she's very health conscious she
[6479.36 - 6484.16] did the green smoothie things and stuff
[6481.72 - 6486.48] long before so I started everything
[6484.16 - 6488.96] celery juice hmbs the all the
[6486.48 - 6491.44] supplements whatever I put my hands on
[6488.96 - 6493.64] but I didn't take this the the no foods
[6491.44 - 6496.68] that serious so it took me a long time
[6493.64 - 6498.72] to really get off the no Foods because I
[6496.68 - 6501.88] also because I was feeling better so my
[6498.72 - 6503.64] son came in back into my life like I
[6501.88 - 6505.24] could I could take a take care of him
[6503.64 - 6508.52] more and more and of course he was
[6505.24 - 6510.80] eating no Foods you know like a gyro
[6508.52 - 6512.56] stuff so I'm like no this smells good
[6510.80 - 6514.60] you know have let me have a bite but
[6512.56 - 6516.28] then I realized later that it really
[6514.60 - 6519.64] makes a difference if I cut out the no
[6516.28 - 6522.00] foods and I went fat free and saltree I
[6519.64 - 6524.72] mean now I'm I went back a little bit
[6522.00 - 6527.24] but I I have that leeway now and I
[6524.72 - 6529.56] really I'm so grateful I can't even say
[6527.24 - 6532.16] I this saved my life or this knowledge
[6529.56 - 6534.00] saves my life and incredible and now
[6532.16 - 6536.36] you're healthy to get on a plane to
[6534.00 - 6537.92] travel all the way here yeah yeah and I
[6536.36 - 6539.92] also I feel the difference between
[6537.92 - 6542.32] coming here the first time in June to
[6539.92 - 6544.36] the cver city book signing and now like
[6542.32 - 6546.96] every time when I have reference points
[6544.36 - 6549.60] I feel like it's going up like this and
[6546.96 - 6553.08] it's going up like this since 2016 like
[6549.60 - 6555.64] every day and it's it's it's a miracle
[6553.08 - 6558.28] because I have so much stress in my life
[6555.64 - 6559.92] my mom has dementia my son is now a
[6558.28 - 6562.40] teenager with tons
[6559.92 - 6565.24] of heavy metals in his brain and the
[6562.40 - 6568.40] behavior is really like a teenager like
[6565.24 - 6570.16] hardcore and I'm a single mom I'm under
[6568.40 - 6572.72] so much stress you have no idea and I'm
[6570.16 - 6575.36] still healing yeah I'm still healing
[6572.72 - 6578.44] it's it's you're doing incredible with
[6575.36 - 6581.16] everything yeah you're healing you're
[6578.44 - 6582.76] here yeah and I know you've got stress

[6582.76 - 6587.72] to be be healthy enough to handle all of
[6585.36 - 6589.92] this and I cured so many symptoms that I
[6587.72 - 6592.72] didn't even know I had so what was some
[6589.92 - 6596.04] of those yes for example I always had
[6592.72 - 6597.08] cold feet always and I was freezing so I
[6596.04 - 6599.72] could not
[6597.08 - 6601.28] tolerate extreme hot or extreme cold not
[6599.72 - 6604.24] even extreme cold little cold I couldn't
[6601.28 - 6607.12] tolerate it at all I got much better all
[6604.24 - 6609.32] my jaw pain left it's gone you know I
[6607.12 - 6611.12] could have just not I could have saved
[6609.32 - 6613.12] myself a lot of money and a lot of pain
[6611.12 - 6615.24] and my teeth would have still been be
[6613.12 - 6616.72] there if I would have found Anthony
[6615.24 - 6618.20] before if I would have found him before
[6616.72 - 6620.56] my son wouldn't even would have stopped
[6618.20 - 6624.12] crying because now I know if I had
[6620.56 - 6626.60] detoxed him as an infant we would have a
[6624.12 - 6627.92] had a beautiful life so I had to go
[6626.60 - 6631.44] through all
[6627.92 - 6634.24] this hardship I don't know for what for
[6631.44 - 6636.40] a Sal gold maybe I don't know but it's
[6634.24 - 6638.28] okay you found it now you're here now
[6636.40 - 6641.08] yeah and I'm so like I'm never going to
[6638.28 - 6643.40] leave this path yeah it's on my path
[6641.08 - 6645.48] it's it's amazing does your son now do
[6643.40 - 6649.56] it at all is he open to it as a teenage
[6645.48 - 6651.76] boy well he did he used to until uh
[6649.56 - 6653.36] about a year ago I guess he fell off the
[6651.76 - 6655.16] bandwagon like big before he was even
[6653.36 - 6656.72] hardcore than me more hardcore than me
[6655.16 - 6658.40] he was like Mom no you don't need that
[6656.72 - 6660.68] salt any anymore I'm like no just a
[6658.40 - 6662.64] little bit salt for my potatoes you know
[6660.68 - 6664.40] he's like no let's put it away and so
[6662.64 - 6667.36] and fat like completely fat you don't
[6664.40 - 6669.88] need that fat so he was like really on
[6667.36 - 6671.64] board doing everything with me even
[6669.88 - 6673.24] getting up early in the morning I guess
[6671.64 - 6675.36] school school starts at 7:00 so you
[6673.24 - 6676.92] would even get up earlier than that like
[6675.36 - 6679.08] earlier than 600 just to do the heavy
[6676.92 - 6681.16] metal detox everything but then all all
[6679.08 - 6684.56] of a sudden he got he fell into the
[6681.16 - 6686.40] protein trap mhm and now he's like oh
[6684.56 - 6688.08] meat you know meat is fine because meat
[6686.40 - 6692.48] can be part of the medical medium diet
[6688.08 - 6695.00] but then he started gluten even SED eggs
[6692.48 - 6697.32] ouch but then he got sick from the eggs
[6695.00 - 6698.96] like scratchy throat and he felt like
[6697.32 - 6701.44] okay so I think I should leave the eggs
[6698.96 - 6703.72] also I worked on it really hard he just
[6701.44 - 6706.40] takes the eggs out but he eats gluten he
[6703.72 - 6708.36] eats milk Keir he's he feels nauseous
[6706.40 - 6710.60] all the time he's like you know what but
[6708.36 - 6712.32] it's just because I ate too much but
[6710.60 - 6714.08] it's okay everyone's journey is
[6712.32 - 6717.92] different and this is a this isn't a
[6714.08 - 6719.68] one-sized fits all uh and he's and I
[6717.92 - 6722.08] just pray every day that he comes back
[6719.68 - 6723.56] and I know he's not completely off
[6722.08 - 6725.16] because when he's sick then he asked me
[6723.56 - 6726.52] you know he's taking supplements and
[6725.16 - 6730.04] then he asked me to do him a celery
[6726.52 - 6732.08] juice yeah and Beau yeah well not not
[6730.04 - 6733.92] that but you know he's taking like
[6732.08 - 6736.56] whatever but I'm sure you're an
[6733.92 - 6738.76] inspiration to him as well you know and
[6736.56 - 6741.20] right now he's in opposition but he yes

[7143.88 - 7147.88] how did you discover medical medium
[7145.36 - 7149.48] information um it was through my mom and
[7147.88 - 7151.76] my best friend Dalton who I've known
[7149.48 - 7155.72] since I was 6 months we joke that we are
[7151.76 - 7157.08] souls that flew into Earth together and
[7155.72 - 7159.92] uh both of them around the same time in
[7157.08 - 7163.00] 2018 were like hey you really need to
[7159.92 - 7164.72] look at this you know page on Instagram
[7163.00 - 7166.64] and at the time I had been searching for
[7164.72 - 7168.44] a very long time for some healing I had
[7166.64 - 7171.08] done every fat diet at one point I was
[7168.44 - 7172.72] doing avocados with bacon because I was
[7171.08 - 7174.48] told your brain was made out of fat so I
[7172.72 - 7177.60] was doing like the I mean I was trying
[7174.48 - 7179.76] everything you know and um just started
[7177.60 - 7181.64] doing lemon honey water and started to
[7179.76 - 7183.28] feel so good and learned you know the
[7181.64 - 7186.08] effects that it had on your liver and
[7183.28 - 7188.04] that the lemons detoxed it and the water
[7186.08 - 7190.52] rehydrated it and the glue and the Honey
[7188.04 - 7192.04] gave you glucose replenishment and I
[7190.52 - 7194.44] just got really into it and then started
[7192.04 - 7197.28] doing celery juice and then cutting out
[7194.44 - 7200.12] the no foods and then doing the vimergy
[7197.28 - 7201.60] supplementation and the meditations and
[7200.12 - 7204.56] now it's just you know completely
[7201.60 - 7206.68] transformed my life I'm living my dream
[7204.56 - 7209.72] uh now doing a totally different career
[7206.68 - 7212.92] living my purpose and just feeling so
[7209.72 - 7215.24] good so much energy so I'm so grateful
[7212.92 - 7216.52] that uh my best friend Dalton and my mom
[7215.24 - 7218.44] brought me that information and now we
[7216.52 - 7220.40] have our own Community you know doing it
[7218.44 - 7222.80] so it's just been awesome that's so
[7220.40 - 7224.04] awesome how incredible what are some of
[7222.80 - 7226.72] the health benefits you've really
[7224.04 - 7229.32] noticed the difference uh of healing
[7226.72 - 7231.76] from medical medum information I was I
[7229.32 - 7234.36] always had a very addictive personality
[7231.76 - 7236.88] from a very young age and so when I was
[7234.36 - 7238.52] younger I had eating disorders and then
[7236.88 - 7239.76] when I was in college I just felt like I
[7238.52 - 7242.64] couldn't keep up I started taking
[7239.76 - 7244.92] Aderall and then I started smoking weed
[7242.64 - 7246.88] and obviously reading the literature and
[7244.92 - 7249.92] reading the scripture of the books I
[7246.88 - 7252.04] realized that that was heavy metals so I
[7249.92 - 7255.24] started detoxing the heavy metals and
[7252.04 - 7258.60] now I am free of all of that and I just
[7255.24 - 7261.40] wake up myself and with so much energy
[7258.60 - 7263.08] and um don't have those chains of
[7261.40 - 7265.12] addiction anymore so that would be
[7263.08 - 7267.44] something huge but I was telling Amber
[7265.12 - 7270.00] on an interview too there's so many
[7267.44 - 7271.56] peripheral healing that has taken place
[7270.00 - 7273.72] as well like I used to hate to travel
[7271.56 - 7276.36] with my husband because I would get such
[7273.72 - 7277.76] high travel anxiety and it just then I'd
[7276.36 - 7281.44] be on the vacation and it wouldn't be
[7277.76 - 7283.88] fun you know i' I'd have anxiety or um
[7281.44 - 7286.56] whatever it may be all that's gone I've
[7283.88 - 7289.32] gone now I've done two trips to Italy
[7286.56 - 7291.04] I've gone to Cabo many times I am
[7289.32 - 7295.48] excited to travel and have these
[7291.04 - 7298.32] experiences so um it it's just so
[7295.48 - 7300.76] incredible um the list of healing is so
[7298.32 - 7303.96] immense but obviously freeing yourself
[7300.76 - 7307.40] of addiction is huge reconnecting with
[7303.96 - 7309.64] My Soul living my dream and you know
[7307.40 - 7313.08] being able to experience life in such a
[7309.64 - 7315.16] fuller manner has just been and
[7313.08 - 7317.24] lifechanging say reconnecting with your
[7315.16 - 7318.96] soul were there any uh spiritual lessons
[7317.24 - 7320.76] you learned on your way your your
[7318.96 - 7322.40] healing way well I think it's funny that
[7320.76 - 7324.08] medical medium says that not a lot of
[7322.40 - 7325.76] people pray to the angels because I feel
[7324.08 - 7328.20] like I got a direct line every day I'm
[7325.76 - 7330.96] like Angel of Mercy Angel of the unknown
[7328.20 - 7333.28] Angels you know so I am so connected
[7330.96 - 7336.84] with praying to the angels and calling
[7333.28 - 7339.92] on them for help and and God as well and
[7336.84 - 7342.16] um that wasn't as woven into my daily
[7339.92 - 7344.64] life I was always you know a believer
[7342.16 - 7347.44] and spiritual but it's just deepened
[7344.64 - 7350.40] that relationship for myself um and then
[7347.44 - 7352.48] also the meditations like there has been
[7350.40 - 7354.36] times where I've done the full moon
[7352.48 - 7355.84] emotional wounds healing meditation
[7354.36 - 7359.44] where I've just balled and I could
[7355.84 - 7363.04] literally feel um you know pain and and
[7359.44 - 7365.20] toxic energy being pulled out of my body
[7363.04 - 7368.92] so I mean all of it it's all been so
[7365.20 - 7371.20] amazing um for me so what is one of the
[7368.92 - 7374.32] most profound lessons you've learned on
[7371.20 - 7377.08] your journey of healing these these
[7374.32 - 7379.52] conditions you are dealing with most
[7377.08 - 7383.52] profound lesson from
[7379.52 - 7386.08] healing I think that God gave us
[7383.52 - 7389.80] everything we need to
[7386.08 - 7394.12] heal and there's evil out there that is
[7389.80 - 7396.40] trying to keep us sick and if you keep
[7394.12 - 7398.40] searching I was around 30 when I started
[7396.40 - 7401.16] sou searching in FA medical medium I was
[7398.40 - 7403.16] really trying to find a way to heal um
[7401.16 - 7405.68] it's out there and that your body wants
[7403.16 - 7409.44] to heal you know your body really does
[7405.68 - 7412.60] want to heal and it works I tried
[7409.44 - 7415.60] everything so I know this works so um I
[7412.60 - 7417.20] think the biggest lesson is just God is
[7415.60 - 7418.52] good and the tools and the resources are
[7417.20 - 7419.96] out there and there's a path to healing
[7418.52 - 7421.96] for everybody you just have to be
[7419.96 - 7424.16] patient and disciplined and use your
[7421.96 - 7425.96] free will to get there beautiful
[7424.16 - 7427.56] beautiful message you know what it's

[8995.60 - 8999.44] love that I love that no it's true right
[8998.08 - 9001.56] I mean younger people need to take care
[8999.44 - 9004.36] of themselves before something happens
[9001.56 - 9005.88] but it's not how things work you know
[9004.36 - 9007.40] right it just doesn't seem like that's
[9005.88 - 9010.28] how it works you're indestructible
[9007.40 - 9012.84] indestructible and then something goes
[9010.28 - 9015.08] wrong right hopefully trying to share
[9012.84 - 9016.88] more of that before everything goes
[9015.08 - 9020.20] wrong I learned it from my parents all

[9603.20 - 9607.92] like to answer ask question for myself
[9605.20 - 9610.76] tonight so I'd like to ask for myself
[9607.92 - 9612.80] tonight um for my teeth they're falling
[9610.76 - 9614.60] apart so much because of all the stress
[9612.80 - 9616.24] I had the last couple of years so I
[9614.60 - 9618.48] really last couple years have been very
[9616.24 - 9620.80] stressful yes and I think the adrenaline
[9618.48 - 9623.28] just is e heating them up and what do I
[9620.80 - 9624.92] do to stop it is the stress continual
[9623.28 - 9626.68] yes and so your adrenaline's always
[9624.92 - 9629.04] going up and then when you finally relax
[9626.68 - 9630.76] it it goes up again and it goes up again
[9629.04 - 9632.48] yes I used to have hot flashes from all
[9630.76 - 9634.36] this stuff too I guess but now that
[9632.48 - 9636.72] after the light blath it it really like
[9634.36 - 9638.16] the hot flashes were gone okay and um
[9636.72 - 9640.76] that's good we're going to do another
[9638.16 - 9642.80] light blast tonight I know I know but I
[9640.76 - 9644.96] what about my teeth like am I what can I
[9642.80 - 9646.64] do like in the night put something on it
[9644.96 - 9649.80] I'm doing the protocols and everything
[9646.64 - 9651.96] but what what can I do to stop the
[9649.80 - 9654.44] they like they're like time capsules too
[9651.96 - 9656.84] you know from years ago I know and then
[9654.44 - 9658.92] I know that but adrenaline tends to
[9656.84 - 9661.08] knock all of our nutrients out and
[9658.92 - 9663.16] everything I know are you doing more
[9661.08 - 9665.28] filler foods are you doing some of the
[9663.16 - 9667.44] med Med real medicinal are you doing the

[9669.16 - 9673.00] them every day so yeah try to get those

[9673.00 - 9679.00] shots yes yes so many nutrients come in
[9675.40 - 9681.68] from that alone okay for teeth yes oh

[10334.80 - 10339.44] lot of dark interference I don't know
[10337.08 - 10343.24] maybe the spiritual book could help with

[10343.24 - 10350.00] okay I believe it will yeah no I I
[10347.52 - 10351.60] understand the challenges uh they just
[10350.00 - 10355.40] seem to be always there especially when
[10351.60 - 10358.12] you have a very bright light okay then
[10355.40 - 10360.24] you get challenged more unfortunately
[10358.12 - 10361.48] yeah the better of a person you are the
[10360.24 - 10364.76] more you get
[10361.48 - 10369.20] challenged keep that in mind
[10364.76 - 10372.60] too and if you're a truly truly
[10369.20 - 10374.56] you know sacred soul with the utmost
[10372.60 - 10376.64] integrity and compassion you'll get
[10374.56 - 10380.16] challenged even
[10376.64 - 10383.08] more it's just the way it works here
[10380.16 - 10384.88] it's so strange it's so strange you get
[10383.08 - 10386.96] people that are not good people they
[10384.88 - 10388.76] never get challenged until they like
[10386.96 - 10390.16] some have a heart attack or something
[10388.76 - 10392.16] down the road whatever it is they don't
[10390.16 - 10394.40] get challenged the same
[10392.16 - 10396.36] way but just you know keep on fighting
[10394.40 - 10398.56] the good fight me thank you you're

[11571.28 - 11576.88] yeah that's my short answer I also had a
[11574.48 - 11579.08] question what's your question should I
[11576.88 - 11581.24] read it to you or show it to you what
[11579.08 - 11583.60] kind of question is it it's read
[11581.24 - 11585.32] nefarious it's just like I knew I was
[11583.60 - 11586.44] going to get I knew I was going to get
[11585.32 - 11589.72] so
[11586.44 - 11591.96] nervous that it's not ambiguous it's not
[11589.72 - 11591.96] it's
[11595.20 - 11601.08] not it's because you have to
[11598.32 - 11604.60] I don't have to I just really want no no
[11601.08 - 11607.16] like is do you have to do that pipe or
[11604.60 - 11608.92] is there any other options I i' be open
[11607.16 - 11612.56] to other
[11608.92 - 11615.52] options I have I have agency here but I
[11612.56 - 11618.12] have fear about where are you from are
[11615.52 - 11619.60] you in I'm from here you're from here
[11618.12 - 11621.64] and you got those pipes is that what it
[11619.60 - 11624.40] is and you want I have a galvanized pipe
[11621.64 - 11626.40] I'm going to replace it uh because it
[11624.40 - 11629.24] could leech lead and so now I have a
[11626.40 - 11631.72] choice you had to if you had to see if
[11629.24 - 11634.88] there's other
[11631.72 - 11638.36] options I very weird question it's not a

[12456.08 - 12462.04] much thanks for coming what's happening
[12459.88 - 12466.32] oh um I just have a question so I've
[12462.04 - 12468.08] never been able to visualize and also um
[12466.32 - 12471.04] I don't listen in her voice and I was
[12468.08 - 12472.84] just wondering you you can visualize
[12471.04 - 12474.68] you're talking about like visualization
[12472.84 - 12478.00] like I close my eyes and it's just black
[12474.68 - 12480.44] I don't see anything but you you you
[12478.00 - 12482.48] know what you're trying to
[12480.44 - 12484.28] visualize do you know what you're trying
[12482.48 - 12485.72] to right when when mean if I think of
[12484.28 - 12487.16] like I'm trying to visualize an apple I
[12485.72 - 12489.64] won't see anything you won't see
[12487.16 - 12491.84] anything it's there it's there that's
[12489.64 - 12495.16] okay but I was wondering is that metals
[12491.84 - 12498.12] or is that the no you might be like even
[12495.16 - 12500.16] Beyond visualiz ization you have to
[12498.12 - 12502.72] understand like it could be bigger than
[12500.16 - 12504.12] that it's not about medals for that like
[12502.72 - 12507.04] you might not be able to visualize
[12504.12 - 12508.96] because you're you're maybe seeing even
[12507.04 - 12511.60] more than you
[12508.96 - 12513.84] know there's some I've seen stuff like
[12511.60 - 12516.08] that happen and spirit tells me it does
[12513.84 - 12518.44] exist where there's a reason why you
[12516.08 - 12520.88] don't see the image because you're
[12518.44 - 12524.76] seeing all these other things around it
[12520.88 - 12527.12] out there so just liart okay think about
[12524.76 - 12528.72] that like don't don't look for the image
[12527.12 - 12530.08] look for the edges of everything when
[12528.72 - 12532.76] you visualize okay I don't know if it's
[12530.08 - 12534.32] similar but not hearing an inner voice
[12532.76 - 12535.76] like it's just kind of silent I don't
[12534.32 - 12538.00] have like chatter or anything I don't
[12535.76 - 12542.72] know if that's that might be a really
[12538.00 - 12542.72] good thing okay let's get a
[12546.76 - 12552.00] picture because with me I'm either
[12548.96 - 12554.84] hearing Spirit or my own thoughts so
[12552.00 - 12556.76] yeah so um if I'm not thinking about
[12554.84 - 12559.08] things I'm hearing spirit if you're not
[12556.76 - 12561.16] hearing chatter that could be amazing

[12891.08 - 12894.60] life like I just want to know big part
[12893.12 - 12897.68] listen the meaning of life has a few
[12894.60 - 12902.20] things all wrapped up in one and one is
[12897.68 - 12904.44] having compassion for animal life oh you
[12902.20 - 12908.64] know like think like like having
[12904.44 - 12911.52] compassion for Seals having compassion
[12908.64 - 12914.52] right for animal life animal life dogs
[12911.52 - 12916.96] and cats yeah and in there's because
[12914.52 - 12918.92] people have they they shut that they
[12916.96 - 12921.12] they they act like they have compassion
[12918.92 - 12923.28] for animal life but they have a shut off
[12921.12 - 12926.60] switch in there and in the end they care
[12923.28 - 12929.36] more about themselves and you know and
[12926.60 - 12931.96] how and the meaning of life is to of
[12929.36 - 12933.96] course have uh respect for yourself of
[12931.96 - 12936.16] course all that's involved and but
[12933.96 - 12938.56] having that true compassion for animal
[12936.16 - 12941.16] life that is one of the secrets to the
[12938.56 - 12942.84] meaning of life thank you for sharing

[12974.20 - 12980.48] meaning of life keep going so
[12977.00 - 12983.24] compassionate for for I love I'm too
[12980.48 - 12985.08] emotional about about that's a big piece
[12983.24 - 12988.96] of the meaning of life that is a very
[12985.08 - 12992.04] big piece it's it's uh having the utmost
[12988.96 - 12994.84] respect for life itself and I I think
[12992.04 - 12998.80] that's lost I think that's you know
[12994.84 - 13002.00] missing in Believe It or Not people
[12998.80 - 13004.00] enjoying their life doesn't mean that
[13002.00 - 13005.60] that's what that means you know of
[13004.00 - 13007.60] course you want to enjoy your life but
[13005.60 - 13010.32] people get confused where enjoying your
[13007.60 - 13011.64] life becomes the meaning of life it's
[13010.32 - 13015.68] more than that
[13011.64 - 13018.28] it's having that respect for life itself
[13015.68 - 13019.48] and that's something different and and
[13018.28 - 13021.16] and that's part of the meaning of life
[13019.48 - 13023.16] and there's more too I I might talk

[13270.12 - 13278.12] was shut out keeps he keeps it shut out
[13275.56 - 13279.56] because of some kind of internal despair
[13278.12 - 13282.56] but so you have to keep on putting the
[13279.56 - 13284.96] light around so that eventually uh he

[16093.44 - 16098.44] you sticking up for us and um I had a
[16096.52 - 16102.64] question to follow up with from last
[16098.44 - 16104.88] night yeah um so does a person's soul um
[16102.64 - 16108.20] before it reincarnates on the earth does
[16104.88 - 16108.20] it choose to be gay or
[16110.00 - 16116.16] straight so it's a really good point um
[16113.00 - 16118.36] I think what's happened right now with
[16116.16 - 16120.84] gender and everything else I think that
[16118.36 - 16124.00] there's so much confusion still I think
[16120.84 - 16125.80] we're in the baby stage is of the world
[16124.00 - 16128.68] understanding any of it kind of breaks
[16125.80 - 16131.16] my heart a lot of confusion a lot of
[16128.68 - 16133.92] misconceptions and I never got I never
[16131.16 - 16135.68] got to uh into a place yet where I've
[16133.92 - 16137.52] been able to talk about it I've been
[16135.68 - 16141.88] doing all these other
[16137.52 - 16144.36] things but whether anybody likes it or
[16141.88 - 16147.88] not
[16144.36 - 16151.20] um a soul can come into a different
[16147.88 - 16152.68] gender body and be a different gender
[16151.20 - 16156.20] soul
[16152.68 - 16158.20] and then that happens I mean there's so
[16156.20 - 16161.80] many things and what about like like the
[16158.20 - 16163.80] same sex attraction would that be a Soul
[16161.80 - 16167.12] Decision before they
[16163.80 - 16169.96] reincarnate it yeah absolutely it can
[16167.12 - 16172.40] absolutely okay is that a couple of

[19579.48 - 19584.20] for a while been with you for a while
[19581.16 - 19586.88] man so I had a question about um like
[19584.20 - 19589.04] the brain retraining you like dispenser
[19586.88 - 19591.40] and why he get so many like you and
[19589.04 - 19592.60] dispenser both get so many healings
[19591.40 - 19594.48] which are kind of two different
[19592.60 - 19596.08] modalities and I know you kind of
[19594.48 - 19599.60] touched on the brain retraining like
[19596.08 - 19601.56] dnrs and you know those guys and but you
[19599.60 - 19604.88] never really went into detail why it's a
[19601.56 - 19607.48] bunk or what's wrong with it like are
[19604.88 - 19610.76] people really healing from that are they
[19607.48 - 19614.40] not well I mean you know it's like
[19610.76 - 19616.64] this um look there's people that heal
[19614.40 - 19619.16] from all kinds of
[19616.64 - 19621.80] things all kinds of
[19619.16 - 19625.04] techniques okay in The Healing Arts in
[19621.80 - 19626.36] the healing real they heal from yoga
[19625.04 - 19628.60] there's people that get healed from
[19626.36 - 19630.08] doing yoga okay there's people that get
[19628.60 - 19632.56] healed from doing you know getting
[19630.08 - 19635.52] massage therapy and then there's people
[19632.56 - 19637.60] who who heal they go to their ACU ACU
[19635.52 - 19640.00] pressur and they're getting ACU pressure
[19637.60 - 19643.08] and they heal and then there's people
[19640.00 - 19645.40] who um they heal doing
[19643.08 - 19650.48] meditations and they heal so there are
[19645.40 - 19652.72] healing but then there's people who are
[19650.48 - 19656.60] on death
[19652.72 - 19659.64] store and that's
[19656.60 - 19661.44] different so you hear out there people
[19659.64 - 19663.80] healing or people
[19661.44 - 19666.00] healing but we can't get that confused
[19663.80 - 19668.16] with people
[19666.00 - 19673.88] who
[19668.16 - 19675.80] are so bad so sick and healed it's two
[19673.88 - 19677.72] different worlds but yes in all the
[19675.80 - 19680.32] Healing Arts people heal doing different
[19677.72 - 19683.32] things let's get a

[20535.28 - 20541.64] ever you guys hear me
[20537.84 - 20541.64] still what is going
[20548.80 - 20553.76] on uh you want to talk about the soul
[20551.04 - 20555.96] for a couple of minutes can we do that
[20553.76 - 20558.44] right
[20555.96 - 20559.76] [Music]
[20558.44 - 20562.68] you know one of the things that always
[20559.76 - 20565.36] blows my mind is that we're always
[20562.68 - 20567.60] governed by time here I mean right every
[20565.36 - 20569.44] every minute it's about what time is it
[20567.60 - 20571.92] time for your appointment time for this
[20569.44 - 20573.96] time to wake up time to go to bed it's
[20571.92 - 20577.16] always about time time there we go is
[20573.96 - 20577.16] this for real I can hear
[20578.88 - 20585.16] now all right all right you know we're
[20582.48 - 20587.20] governed by time that's what it is
[20585.16 - 20589.16] everything we do it's based on the
[20587.20 - 20593.56] minute based on the
[20589.16 - 20596.40] hour right we age every day it's time
[20593.56 - 20599.76] that's how it works okay the earth goes
[20596.40 - 20603.64] around the sun right and then every
[20599.76 - 20607.16] minute clicks by all around the planet
[20603.64 - 20610.80] time owns US it owns US physically it
[20607.16 - 20614.36] really does and and that's hard because
[20610.80 - 20617.92] human beings being owned is is never a
[20614.36 - 20619.48] good feeling but time owns us here
[20617.92 - 20622.80] physically on the
[20619.48 - 20626.44] planet and but what happens with our
[20622.80 - 20629.32] soul is time doesn't own our soul so it
[20626.44 - 20631.00] may own us right now physically you wake
[20629.32 - 20633.16] up in the morning you're like crap it's
[20631.00 - 20635.60] 8:00 in the morning I'm I'm
[20633.16 - 20637.16] late you go to bed at night it's like I
[20635.60 - 20640.00] went to bed too
[20637.16 - 20641.72] late right oh I'm one of those people
[20640.00 - 20645.44] that stays up through the night because
[20641.72 - 20647.76] I everything comes to me at that point I
[20645.44 - 20650.80] seem to come to life at night the world
[20647.76 - 20655.60] is quiet I come to life at night right
[20650.80 - 20659.32] you know that feeling but time owns our
[20655.60 - 20662.64] physical body and all the things we do
[20659.32 - 20667.72] here but it doesn't own our soul it has
[20662.64 - 20670.60] no no Authority on your soul which is
[20667.72 - 20674.04] unbelievable when you think about that
[20670.60 - 20677.20] and our soul right is in us it's there
[20674.04 - 20680.12] every day it's here but time time
[20677.20 - 20683.60] doesn't run it time doesn't own it it's
[20680.12 - 20687.80] its own thing so much
[20683.60 - 20691.08] so okay that when we leave here time
[20687.80 - 20693.60] doesn't own it then on any level or
[20691.08 - 20695.52] control it on any level it doesn't
[20693.60 - 20699.08] matter what planets are going around the
[20695.52 - 20702.12] Sun Mars going around the sun earth
[20699.08 - 20705.48] going around the Sun it doesn't matter
[20702.12 - 20709.24] there's no rules those rules are gone
[20705.48 - 20713.40] there's none of those time is over your
[20709.24 - 20716.04] soul has that power it has that ability
[20713.40 - 20718.20] it can it can put control on time versus
[20716.04 - 20721.76] time controlling our soul it's one of
[20718.20 - 20724.92] God's laws one of God's laws is hey your
[20721.76 - 20728.16] soul can't be messed with it can't be
[20724.92 - 20730.80] touched and time doesn't rule it
[20728.16 - 20734.28] unbelievable really when you think about
[20730.80 - 20738.80] it but think about how powerful your
[20734.28 - 20742.00] soul is with everything and anything you
[20738.80 - 20743.72] got to kind of get into that zone where
[20742.00 - 20746.92] wow I didn't know my soul was that

[20800.00 - 20803.32] through the web and you see something
[20801.84 - 20805.08] where someone dies and all of a sudden a
[20803.32 - 20807.48] white orb lifts up or something did you

[20828.00 - 20832.60] power and this light and this frequency
[20831.16 - 20834.96] and what you do when you're doing
[20832.60 - 20837.40] medical medium information is you're not
[20834.96 - 20841.08] just physically healing but you're
[20837.40 - 20843.80] strengthening the frequency of your soul
[20841.08 - 20848.28] how powerful is that you
[20843.80 - 20851.64] are yeah you're making it stronger
[20848.28 - 20854.12] you're making your soul even stronger

[20854.12 - 20859.00] medical medium information you're making
[20856.20 - 20860.92] your soul even even more powerful so
[20859.00 - 20863.44] that when it leaves here someday and
[20860.92 - 20866.32] look whether we like it or not or
[20863.44 - 20868.88] whatever 100 years from now 150 years
[20866.32 - 20872.32] from now whatever it is our soul does
[20868.88 - 20874.80] have to head off it's got to go back
[20872.32 - 20879.96] behind the Stars somewhere it's going to
[20874.80 - 20881.20] go way up there to the kingdom right
[20879.96 - 20883.64] where does you where do you want your
[20881.20 - 20886.04] soul to go do you want it to stay in a
[20883.64 - 20888.44] house somewhere and just be a ghost no
[20886.04 - 20889.64] you want it to go up all the way you
[20888.44 - 20893.36] never know what's going to come out of
[20889.64 - 20893.36] my mouth when I when I'm live like
[20895.32 - 20900.72] this dear
[20897.72 - 20900.72] Lord
[20902.24 - 20909.00] so but our soul it holds this power but
[20906.16 - 20911.92] we have to know that we have to remember
[20909.00 - 20916.08] that we have to honor that we have to
[20911.92 - 20917.40] see that it's important to see it really
[20916.08 - 20919.04] is
[20917.40 - 20921.08] one of the things our soul has
[20919.04 - 20924.36] information about is food Believe It or
[20921.08 - 20927.36] Not Century after Century after Century
[20924.36 - 20929.48] what did you eat five lifetimes ago what
[20927.36 - 20931.56] did you what did you eat two lifetimes
[20929.48 - 20934.12] ago were you somebody that lived in the
[20931.56 - 20936.72] woods and you just ate rocks and dirt
[20934.12 - 20939.16] and a soup of some seaweed and some
[20936.72 - 20942.00] other stuff to survive what did you eat
[20939.16 - 20944.84] did you eat twigs and berries what did
[20942.00 - 20947.44] you eat in all these past lives right
[20944.84 - 20949.84] our soul has all this information in it
[20947.44 - 20952.68] about what you did last lifetime the
[20949.84 - 20956.12] lifetime before that and far beyond that
[20952.68 - 20958.60] it has all this incredible information
[20956.12 - 20961.84] like books and books and books and books
[20958.60 - 20964.56] worth is just all tied into
[20961.84 - 20965.96] it but we have to know that and realize
[20964.56 - 20967.68] it because we can go through a life
[20965.96 - 20969.88] without even understanding our soul even
[20967.68 - 20972.24] the a fraction of it did you know that
[20969.88 - 20974.04] we a whole life can pass and we don't
[20972.24 - 20976.00] even know any of this we're just living
[20974.04 - 20978.40] our life walking around you know like
[20976.00 - 20983.16] okay I'm living my life on planet
[20978.40 - 20985.16] Earth yeah but we can't connect unless
[20983.16 - 20987.36] we understand we should unless we
[20985.16 - 20991.12] realize it we have to know a couple of
[20987.36 - 20995.08] things the rule the rule that our soul
[20991.12 - 20996.44] rides over time it rules over time time
[20995.08 - 20998.76] can't touch
[20996.44 - 21001.12] it another thing we have all this
[20998.76 - 21004.20] information from all these lives
[21001.12 - 21006.76] beforehand and sickness did you know you
[21004.20 - 21008.48] could have healed before in five life
[21006.76 - 21010.12] times ago two lifetimes ago last
[21008.48 - 21011.68] lifetime ago do you know you may have
[21010.12 - 21013.80] already healed did you know you could
[21011.68 - 21015.88] have been sick already in a past
[21013.80 - 21018.36] lifetime you could have been on mattress
[21015.88 - 21021.04] Island and then a thousand years ago you
[21018.36 - 21022.20] could have been on Hay Island just a
[21021.04 - 21024.96] bunch of
[21022.20 - 21027.84] grass with some kind of like wool
[21024.96 - 21030.72] blanket thrown over you and that's it a
[21027.84 - 21034.84] little fire right by
[21030.72 - 21037.44] you but you healed you got to connect to
[21034.84 - 21039.24] that you got to remember I healed in a
[21037.44 - 21041.04] past lifetime you don't believe it you

[21339.32 - 21345.52] appreciate Spirit more spirit and I have
[21342.48 - 21348.00] been sparring still you
[21345.52 - 21349.96] know it's all good it's all good we get
[21348.00 - 21353.20] along
[21349.96 - 21355.12] enough Spirit has I know I'm all over
[21353.20 - 21357.60] the place today Spirit has a strange
[21355.12 - 21359.92] sound a strange voice strange language
[21357.60 - 21362.40] it's the weirdest thing I think at some
[21359.92 - 21365.24] point I'm going to try to document that
[21362.40 - 21368.24] so you know what it sounds like and what
[21365.24 - 21368.24] the words are
[21369.24 - 21373.88] it's not normal I can tell you
[21371.84 - 21377.44] that
[21373.88 - 21380.72] do it's just it's it's the words are
[21377.44 - 21383.44] very not not usual words and I have to
[21380.72 - 21385.24] change the word to match the same word
[21383.44 - 21388.04] it's kind of like an ancient language
[21385.24 - 21390.20] you know where the word is different
[21388.04 - 21392.68] than the word but they're the same the
[21390.20 - 21394.80] same meaning and everything they're just
[21392.68 - 21397.04] a little different it's an older
[21394.80 - 21400.64] language it's taking too many years to
[21397.04 - 21403.44] figure out but I have to tell you guys
[21400.64 - 21406.72] it's not a mistake what we're all doing

[21406.72 - 21410.96] a

[22509.56 - 22517.68] back to 2017 though absolutely okay um
[22514.32 - 22521.64] and um I started uh right when I found
[22517.68 - 22524.76] the book um and um it was no wonder that
[22521.64 - 22526.80] I founded uh found it because um I was
[22524.76 - 22529.76] suffering more than 35 years for more
[22526.80 - 22532.52] than 35 years and I always was looking
[22529.76 - 22534.56] for for information for help and nobody
[22532.52 - 22537.52] could help me and uh I had this the
[22534.56 - 22540.96] story as the most uh people in the mm
[22537.52 - 22545.64] Community have have that um I tried
[22540.96 - 22547.40] everything and um every every time I was
[22545.64 - 22549.04] at the at the doctor's office they they
[22547.40 - 22551.00] told me that my blood work is perfect
[22549.04 - 22553.56] everything was perfect everything's fine
[22551.00 - 22556.52] so it's just in your head and I knew
[22553.56 - 22560.00] that it wasn't in my head and later on
[22556.52 - 22563.28] when I was in my 40s then uh I started
[22560.00 - 22566.12] getting really diagnosis uh but just
[22563.28 - 22570.60] once with CA un know
[22566.12 - 22575.16] so the same corner and
[22570.60 - 22578.76] uh it went more and more bad and worse
[22575.16 - 22581.76] and uh I had times uh when I really
[22578.76 - 22584.52] didn't want to live anymore because uh I
[22581.76 - 22589.08] was just in pain and uh stiffness and I
[22584.52 - 22591.84] had more than uh 50 symptoms symptoms uh
[22589.08 - 22591.84] I had
[22592.72 - 22599.32] um I was a brain fall fatigue and I was
[22596.52 - 22601.68] bad ridden part-time bad ridden I had
[22599.32 - 22605.52] severe migraine severe constipation from
[22601.68 - 22608.28] my youth uh beginning on and um so it
[22605.52 - 22611.32] was really bad and uh when I found this
[22608.28 - 22613.84] information and I started and I I didn't
[22611.32 - 22616.24] jumped in with the whole information I
[22613.84 - 22620.56] just started slowly with celery juice
[22616.24 - 22624.08] and don't eating uh no Foods uh but not

[22624.08 - 22631.32] full power and with 20 day8 CLE cleanse
[22627.20 - 22634.44] and such things I didn't uh do that um
[22631.32 - 22637.88] but my migraine was and I had really SE
[22634.44 - 22640.52] severe migraine I I was laying uh I

[22904.04 - 22908.32] it was perfect a perfect evening yes and
[22906.96 - 22909.92] speaking of blast what was your
[22908.32 - 22913.20] experience like with the light blast
[22909.92 - 22916.48] tonight you know I felt it go through me
[22913.20 - 22918.76] very quickly and he did it several times
[22916.48 - 22921.16] and he said this was a very positive
[22918.76 - 22924.68] atmosphere in the room and it it seemed
[22921.16 - 22927.68] to flow it went easily and there's a
[22924.68 - 22930.92] good vibe here and I think a lot of it
[22927.68 - 22933.20] begins with the food at Cafe Gratitude
[22930.92 - 22936.60] and it's good for your body it's healing
[22933.20 - 22939.16] for your body it makes you feel better
[22936.60 - 22941.48] and you know you're putting something
[22939.16 - 22943.80] good into your body you don't have to
[22941.48 - 22947.00] worry about preservatives or anything
[22943.80 - 22949.68] like that it's soy free oil free
[22947.00 - 22952.68] glutenfree and you know it contributes
[22949.68 - 22955.24] to the positive vibing here and I think
[22952.68 - 22957.04] the people come here with a good
[22955.24 - 22960.60] attitude knowing they're going to be
[22957.04 - 22963.68] taken care of physically mentally
[22960.60 - 22965.76] emotionally and spiritually because
[22963.68 - 22969.56] physically your body is going to feel
[22965.76 - 22973.44] better mentally and emotionally you're
[22969.56 - 22976.76] meeting people around you at your table
[22973.44 - 22980.00] that are always in this well when you're
[22976.76 - 22983.56] here you're in this kind of a good vibe
[22980.00 - 22986.84] good feeling and spiritually medical
[22983.56 - 22992.28] medium did a light blast and it's like
[22986.84 - 22995.00] yay I feel better I feel like it's
[22992.28 - 22997.36] it's oh well that's what you get when
[22995.00 - 22998.88] it's live right yes we get it when it's
[22997.36 - 23000.60] live I mean the atmosphere no one wants
[22998.88 - 23002.40] to leave everyone's swapping numbers
[23000.60 - 23005.00] we're connecting with each other right
[23002.40 - 23007.92] exactly and I met this wonderful woman
[23005.00 - 23010.24] here from the east coast and she's going
[23007.92 - 23014.20] back tomorrow and I met someone else
[23010.24 - 23017.80] from just a few miles away and oh when I
[23014.20 - 23020.92] first first came I met this person from
[23017.80 - 23023.68] Europe that came here in December and it
[23020.92 - 23026.00] was cancelled and he came and so he
[23023.68 - 23027.80] stayed in La for a little while and then
[23026.00 - 23030.80] he came back and he was able to get
[23027.80 - 23033.40] tickets for today so you know it's an
[23030.80 - 23036.92] allaround good feeling even though he
[23033.40 - 23040.40] had a disappointment in December cuz or
[23036.92 - 23043.00] or it was in January but then we had the
[23040.40 - 23046.80] LA fires but you had to get your tickets
[23043.00 - 23051.80] in December it's like going along with
[23046.80 - 23054.40] the flow of life you know and it seems
[23051.80 - 23057.88] like when you're in here you're in a
[23054.40 - 23061.08] safe place and out there is the rest of
[23057.88 - 23063.68] the world so you feel protected you know
[23061.08 - 23067.20] you're doing good for yourself you know
[23063.68 - 23069.84] that people here are of like mind and
[23067.20 - 23071.64] it's a good feeling yes do you think uh
[23069.84 - 23073.84] having these medical medium friendly
[23071.64 - 23075.52] meals on the menu here at Cafe Gratitude
[23073.84 - 23077.16] and cleans options will make people's
[23075.52 - 23079.72] healing Journey easier and more
[23077.16 - 23082.76] enjoyable this is one place where you
[23079.72 - 23085.52] can feel safe that you know you're are
[23082.76 - 23087.28] putting something good into your body
[23085.52 - 23089.56] it's not going to fight with you it's
[23087.28 - 23092.80] not going to harm you it's not going to
[23089.56 - 23097.32] give you like gurgling sounds or
[23092.80 - 23100.76] whatever it's going to be healing and
[23097.32 - 23104.72] the fact that medical medium now has
[23100.76 - 23108.40] some things on the menu that are his
[23104.72 - 23113.92] from the uh brain saver book he's got a
[23108.40 - 23117.36] lot a lot of um offerings of uh menus
[23113.92 - 23119.68] shakes and even pizza if you can believe
[23117.36 - 23121.64] it or not you know so there's something
[23119.68 - 23124.32] here for everybody there were children
[23121.64 - 23126.56] here tonight you know and that is such a
[23124.32 - 23131.08] blessing that they are getting this
[23126.56 - 23133.24] information at such an early age and
[23131.08 - 23137.56] there was this 11-year-old girl that sat
[23133.24 - 23143.04] next to me and we chatted and I said you
[23137.56 - 23146.00] know if I had known this at age 11 my
[23143.04 - 23148.96] life would have been totally different
[23146.00 - 23152.52] it has to be if you're introduced to
[23148.96 - 23156.08] this as a child you know your outlook on
[23152.52 - 23158.28] life is different you know you're always
[23156.08 - 23161.64] supported you know there's something
[23158.28 - 23164.36] more in life and not just the physical
[23161.64 - 23167.88] of what you see and you tend to have
[23164.36 - 23169.88] more of a forgiving nature you know
[23167.88 - 23171.56] there is so much empathy and compassion
[23169.88 - 23175.16] and kindness in this community you can
[23171.56 - 23179.20] really feel it yes yes and of course
[23175.16 - 23181.24] it's it's something you pick up from uh
[23179.20 - 23183.80] certain Healing Foods or if you're
[23181.24 - 23186.60] drinking celery juice and and for
[23183.80 - 23189.76] medical medium too because he
[23186.60 - 23193.40] communicates with Spirit of compassion
[23189.76 - 23195.64] so if we could all learn to have just at
[23193.40 - 23198.32] least a little bit more compassion for
[23195.64 - 23202.32] other people I know some people have a
[23198.32 - 23205.68] very sharp tongue and some people are
[23202.32 - 23208.88] quick to anger and some people want to
[23205.68 - 23211.08] get back at you and there's all kinds of
[23208.88 - 23214.00] feelings out there and if you're a
[23211.08 - 23215.76] sensitive person you can tune into that
[23214.00 - 23218.84] and so you
[23215.76 - 23221.36] realize that they are human beings
[23218.84 - 23224.64] having their experience so you don't
[23221.36 - 23228.08] take it that personally and you you you
[23224.64 - 23231.36] seem to have more compassion for them
[23228.08 - 23235.84] cuz you're not drowning your body in a
[23231.36 - 23237.88] lot of one thing unhealthy food I mean
[23235.84 - 23239.80] sometimes we like to have a little bit
[23237.88 - 23242.20] of
[23239.80 - 23244.04] indulgence you know especially in the
[23242.20 - 23246.44] summer like a little ice cream or
[23244.04 - 23249.84] something but you know dairyfree ice
[23246.44 - 23253.32] cream so it just makes me appreciate
[23249.84 - 23254.76] people a lot more because you see each
[23253.32 - 23258.40] person more
[23254.76 - 23261.52] as an individual having their own
[23258.40 - 23264.48] journey and they make mistakes and they
[23261.52 - 23267.60] have love and they get angry and they
[23264.48 - 23270.96] try to be a better person and it's all
[23267.60 - 23272.68] part of life yes yes so I want to ask
[23270.96 - 23274.68] you a little bit about your journey with
[23272.68 - 23276.84] medical medium information what have you
[23274.68 - 23280.64] healed from using this information what
[23276.84 - 23282.96] have I healed I wish I could say there's
[23280.64 - 23287.16] one thing that's totally healed and it's
[23282.96 - 23288.80] great but not for me I'm healing a
[23287.16 - 23290.60] little bit here and a little bit there
[23288.80 - 23294.52] and a little bit here and a little bit
[23290.60 - 23298.16] there and that's part of my journey so
[23294.52 - 23300.64] there's no one big miracle like you know
[23298.16 - 23303.96] I've read testimonials I've seen you
[23300.64 - 23307.52] know videos of people that one person
[23303.96 - 23311.08] healed 49 symptoms I mean come on that's
[23307.52 - 23315.16] a lot of work but I think most of my
[23311.08 - 23318.16] work has been internal just
[23315.16 - 23321.08] um trying to have more compassion for
[23318.16 - 23323.76] people and understanding them in a
[23321.08 - 23326.92] different light than I would have 10
[23323.76 - 23329.32] years ago for example or 20 years ago
[23326.92 - 23332.12] and realizing that each person has their
[23329.32 - 23334.76] own Journey so I think most of my
[23332.12 - 23337.88] healing has been internal so I don't
[23334.76 - 23341.48] even really see it it's not so much you
[23337.88 - 23344.52] know the physical ailments so that I
[23341.48 - 23346.44] think it's brought me a greater
[23344.52 - 23348.92] understanding of human
[23346.44 - 23351.40] nature and I think that's important cuz
[23348.92 - 23355.16] I think you know we could all get along
[23351.40 - 23357.32] better if we had more insight into
[23355.16 - 23360.80] people and and their Journey we don't
[23357.32 - 23363.76] have to be you know
[23360.80 - 23366.68] professional people that are trained in
[23363.76 - 23370.48] this you just have to remember you have
[23366.68 - 23372.56] a heart and other people have a heart
[23370.48 - 23374.44] and we're all going through our same
[23372.56 - 23377.20] journey and I think that that's the
[23374.44 - 23380.28] biggest gift that medical medium has
[23377.20 - 23382.88] given me just being able to see things
[23380.28 - 23385.60] in a different light well that's a huge
[23382.88 - 23387.76] gift thank you well thank you so much
[23385.60 - 23390.40] for talking to us thank
[23387.76 - 23392.96] you oh it's been beautiful thank you for
[23390.40 - 23395.48] sharing your night thank you and I thank
[23392.96 - 23398.40] everybody who came here tonight and
[23395.48 - 23402.96] especially who you know was fortunate
[23398.40 - 23405.28] enough to experience the light blast is
[23402.96 - 23408.32] blessed you know because just being
[23405.28 - 23412.80] around medical medium I mean he's got a
[23408.32 - 23416.28] lot of energy but he has so much depth
[23412.80 - 23418.36] but he's very human and talks on a level
[23416.28 - 23422.60] that everybody understands and can
[23418.36 - 23426.64] relate to he's very relatable you know
[23422.60 - 23428.68] and so that to me is important so it was
[23426.64 - 23430.84] great thank thank you so much that's so
[23428.68 - 23433.28] true thank you so much enjoy the rest of

[23440.44 - 23445.76] evening I am oh it's wonderful yes what
[23443.64 - 23447.80] was your favorite part of the night
[23445.76 - 23449.56] definitely the light blast definitely
[23447.80 - 23451.80] light blast I mean yeah people the
[23449.56 - 23453.84] people and the light blast yeah what was
[23451.80 - 23457.56] your experience like with the light
[23453.84 - 23459.12] blast um it's always pretty strong um
[23457.56 - 23461.80] this time around because I had a light
[23459.12 - 23464.60] blast yesterday it actually felt it felt
[23461.80 - 23466.84] so easeful um
[23464.60 - 23468.76] and I just feel afterwards I feel so
[23466.84 - 23472.12] happy and I feel so light for the lack
[23468.76 - 23475.24] of better word um and I always feel like
[23472.12 - 23477.28] an immediate shift in my emotional state
[23475.24 - 23479.00] and then further on I think in the days
[23477.28 - 23482.44] to come I usually start feeling things
[23479.00 - 23484.20] in my body um maybe certain symptoms or
[23482.44 - 23486.48] certain discomforts that I have they
[23484.20 - 23489.48] just fade away and so I'm I'm a big fan
[23486.48 - 23491.60] of light blasts um whether in person or
[23489.48 - 23493.96] online and what was your experience like

[23501.20 - 23507.64] most kind man I've ever met he just he
[23504.80 - 23509.92] just radiates kindness and care and it's
[23507.64 - 23512.08] amazing to me how every single person
[23509.92 - 23515.68] that comes up to him like he genuinely
[23512.08 - 23518.36] cares about them and um it's it's such a
[23515.68 - 23520.96] it's such an honor such a privilege and

[23533.32 - 23536.92] guacamole I thought it was absolutely
[23535.00 - 23539.00] delicious and then I also really loved

[23578.24 - 23583.88] the community here absolutely it's um
[23582.36 - 23586.48] it's so beautiful I was just talking to
[23583.88 - 23588.60] someone about it that every single
[23586.48 - 23590.28] person is so kind like every single
[23588.60 - 23593.16] person is someone you're so happy to
[23590.28 - 23595.24] meet and I think maybe because of the
[23593.16 - 23597.08] healing Journeys this all the community
[23595.24 - 23599.12] has been through they're just the
[23597.08 - 23601.48] kindest bunch and I've made so many
[23599.12 - 23604.80] friends here already and it's just a
[23601.48 - 23606.68] it's it feels like the best party ever
[23604.80 - 23608.12] yes yes and what's your favorite piece
[23606.68 - 23610.80] of medical medum
[23608.12 - 23613.96] information that's a very hard question
[23610.80 - 23617.04] I think the one that I site most often
[23613.96 - 23619.72] to other people um is the piece about
[23617.04 - 23621.08] the autoimmune diseases that um he says
[23619.72 - 23622.96] that the body never really attacks
[23621.08 - 23625.20] itself it's just a virus that we can
[23622.96 - 23628.64] detect and I think to me when I first
[23625.20 - 23630.56] read it um that maybe made me fall in
[23628.64 - 23631.68] love with medical medium information
[23630.56 - 23633.20] because it's something I never thought
[23631.68 - 23634.88] about in that way before and it really
[23633.20 - 23636.96] clicked for me like I really felt it in
[23634.88 - 23638.76] my body that like it's not attacking me
[23636.96 - 23641.80] it's not attacking itself it wants me to
[23638.76 - 23644.88] heal so um I'd say that one but there's
[23641.80 - 23646.80] so many that it's hard to yes yes what
[23644.88 - 23649.12] have you hailed using medical medium
[23646.80 - 23651.56] information um I'm one of the lucky ones
[23649.12 - 23654.44] that started without severe symptoms in
[23651.56 - 23657.44] 2017 and then uh I got very deep into
[23654.44 - 23659.44] medical medium in 2021 when I had for
[23657.44 - 23662.76] about a year year and a half I had this
[23659.44 - 23665.88] mystery neurological rash all over my
[23662.76 - 23668.32] body um which had intense both like you
[23665.88 - 23670.48] know rash symptoms and neurology and I
[23668.32 - 23673.40] went to the regular doctors I got
[23670.48 - 23676.40] biopsies I got tests I went to TCM
[23673.40 - 23678.00] doctor s nobody knew what it was and I
[23676.40 - 23680.72] start tried taking some allopathic
[23678.00 - 23683.00] medicine and I just felt worse and um
[23680.72 - 23685.92] then I did a medical medium cleanse and
[23683.00 - 23687.64] it went away finally and uh I think that
[23685.92 - 23690.40] was my breaking point where I was like
[23687.64 - 23692.56] okay yeah this is this is what works and
[23690.40 - 23695.80] I'm not dabbling anymore I'm you know
[23692.56 - 23698.04] fully fully committed was that the 369
[23695.80 - 23701.68] cleanse you did or the morning cleanse I
[23698.04 - 23703.68] did um I did a 28 day cleanse and the
[23701.68 - 23707.80] yeah the symptoms went away and then un
[23703.68 - 23709.48] fortunately I got a medical treatment um
[23707.80 - 23711.04] and it the symptoms came back and then I
[23709.48 - 23713.12] did the same cleanse again and it went
[23711.04 - 23715.60] away for good and then since then I've
[23713.12 - 23718.84] been doing all all the cleanses uh and I
[23715.60 - 23722.04] try to do them regularly and um there's
[23718.84 - 23723.84] just so many symptoms that I didn't pay
[23722.04 - 23725.92] very close attention to but they
[23723.84 - 23727.76] improved like my mental my mental health
[23725.92 - 23731.00] my mental Clarity is incredible when I
[23727.76 - 23732.68] do the cleanses uh my skin uh just the
[23731.00 - 23737.16] way I feel my relationship with the food
[23732.68 - 23738.60] and the body um has really healed uh the
[23737.16 - 23742.00] deeper that I got into the medical

[23959.36 - 23966.36] blast I feel like they just go right
[23961.20 - 23968.12] through um but when I first got his
[23966.36 - 23970.12] light blast in the beginning when he
[23968.12 - 23973.40] first did the first one
[23970.12 - 23976.56] um I could feel like it come and it's
[23973.40 - 23979.12] stopped right here and then um when it
[23976.56 - 23981.48] stopped right here I felt like I wanted

[23981.48 - 23987.04] mouth and um and then you know he did it
[23985.28 - 23989.56] again and then I kind of felt it stop
[23987.04 - 23991.40] again and then after you know he did a
[23989.56 - 23993.48] couple more and then it felt it go right
[23991.40 - 23995.88] through um but that was my experience
[23993.48 - 23997.40] with the first light blast definitely it
[23995.88 - 23999.72] hit me right here in the chest and it
[23997.40 - 24003.56] stopped and then cuz you know how he
[23999.72 - 24005.80] says hold your breath so I was like like
[24003.56 - 24008.56] something wanted to like come out and
[24005.80 - 24011.12] then I was like that was my experience
[24008.56 - 24012.96] with that so it was really interesting

[24037.92 - 24041.28] good yeah so how did you discover
[24039.52 - 24044.00] medical medium information how's it
[24041.28 - 24048.00] helped you on your healing Journey so
[24044.00 - 24049.80] with me I discovered it because I was
[24048.00 - 24051.56] having
[24049.80 - 24055.68] um
[24051.56 - 24060.92] gastritis um I had like toenail fungus I
[24055.68 - 24063.68] had like cold sores and then um nausea
[24060.92 - 24066.76] for like a whole year
[24063.68 - 24069.56] and I just was
[24066.76 - 24071.96] looking for anything to help me I was
[24069.56 - 24072.64] taking supplements I was wasting a lot
[24071.96 - 24077.52] of
[24072.64 - 24079.56] money and then I was looking into
[24077.52 - 24082.20] holistic you
[24079.56 - 24085.08] know doctor someone that could help me
[24082.20 - 24086.56] and then I found someone and I went to
[24085.08 - 24087.60] her and when I went to her she told me
[24086.56 - 24091.24] about medical
[24087.60 - 24094.40] medium and I started following him on
[24091.24 - 24096.40] Instagram and then from from there I
[24094.40 - 24098.80] wasn't paying much attention to the post
[24096.40 - 24100.48] though I was just following him but she
[24098.80 - 24102.88] kept telling me are you drinking celery
[24100.48 - 24104.68] juice when I would see her because my
[24102.88 - 24107.80] son and her son were in the same
[24104.68 - 24109.08] classroom and then I'd be like uh yeah
[24107.80 - 24111.20] yeah I'm I'm going get on it I'm going
[24109.08 - 24114.40] to get on it and then um I finally got
[24111.20 - 24117.60] on it and it was helping me and then I
[24114.40 - 24120.56] kind of fell off and then I became
[24117.60 - 24121.48] really sick again and then I started it
[24120.56 - 24125.16] back
[24121.48 - 24127.08] up and then after after that I she
[24125.16 - 24129.28] tagged me on a healing
[24127.08 - 24131.60] story because I had been diagnosed with
[24129.28 - 24134.56] Barett esophagus and they had told me
[24131.60 - 24136.48] there was no cure and so she tagged me
[24134.56 - 24139.36] on a healing story that someone had
[24136.48 - 24142.52] healed barit esophagus so then I started
[24139.36 - 24145.08] following them and I started copying
[24142.52 - 24146.76] everything they were doing on Instagram
[24145.08 - 24148.88] and I started
[24146.76 - 24151.48] recovering and but I hadn't read the
[24148.88 - 24153.88] books I was just copying whatever this
[24151.48 - 24157.28] girl did I was doing it and I started
[24153.88 - 24159.44] healing and I told someone else about
[24157.28 - 24160.84] medical medium and then they came back
[24159.44 - 24163.04] to me and they were like oh I bought his
[24160.84 - 24166.32] book and then I was like wait I need to
[24163.04 - 24169.24] get the books myself and then I started
[24166.32 - 24172.32] you know reading the information and it
[24169.24 - 24173.96] started making so much sense and yeah
[24172.32 - 24175.76] that's how it happened you know what's
[24173.96 - 24177.48] interesting to me is the fact that uh
[24175.76 - 24180.12] you heard this story of someone else who
[24177.48 - 24181.56] was going through a similar dealing with
[24180.12 - 24185.20] a similar condition or the same
[24181.56 - 24187.40] condition and that inspired you you were
[24185.20 - 24190.80] seeing their healing Journey it inspired
[24187.40 - 24194.88] you with your healing Journey CU I I was
[24190.80 - 24197.84] already dying and I needed like I just
[24194.88 - 24202.08] saw that if she did it then it had to
[24197.84 - 24204.24] help me I had nothing else I had nothing
[24202.08 - 24205.92] else so by that person sharing the
[24204.24 - 24208.12] healing Journey you were inspired and
[24205.92 - 24209.80] it's just now taking me to this moment
[24208.12 - 24211.48] where you're brave enough to open up and
[24209.80 - 24213.84] share your healing Journey you don't
[24211.48 - 24215.44] know who you might may be inspiring out
[24213.84 - 24218.20] there as well it's really incredible
[24215.44 - 24222.16] yeah so yeah it's incredible what

[24270.20 - 24276.56] every year and we know that that is like
[24273.28 - 24278.80] in a lowered immune system and so I was
