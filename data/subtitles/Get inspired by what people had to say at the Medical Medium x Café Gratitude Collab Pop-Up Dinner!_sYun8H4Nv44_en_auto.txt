[3.12 - 7.36] who were going through their own healing
[5.88 - 10.08] Journeys in the four years I've been
[7.36 - 11.92] doing this I have seen so much healing
[10.08 - 13.60] for the people who actually apply it and
[11.92 - 15.00] keep going with it at the beginning of
[13.60 - 17.32] my journey I can only drink a little
[15.00 - 20.68] shot gloss of celery juice and now I'm
[17.32 - 22.44] up to 32 o a day really just keep going
[20.68 - 25.52] you know if you started and you're
[22.44 - 27.64] doubting uh that's you know negativity
[25.52 - 30.16] trying to pull you off your healing path
[27.64 - 31.36] try it your body will start to thve and
[30.16 - 34.36] you'll see a difference that gives you
[31.36 - 36.28] the hope to keep going don't give up
