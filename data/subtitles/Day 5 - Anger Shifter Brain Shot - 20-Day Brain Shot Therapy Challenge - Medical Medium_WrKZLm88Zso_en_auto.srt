1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,839
what happens in our brain when we get

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,740
angry what goes wrong inside of our

3
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:09,360
brain

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,980
when we get mad

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,280
we get upset

6
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:16,800
and we get angry or we even hold that

7
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:20,100
anger out it's not like we want to hold

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,199
that anger out we don't want to be angry

9
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,779
you don't want to be angry do you know

10
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:27,539
anybody that wants to be angry where you

11
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:30,420
want to be angry and you want to stay

12
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:32,460
angry no way right

13
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:35,880
because people don't want to be

14
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:38,520
naturally angry on any level do they

15
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:41,340
we're talking about the anger shifter

16
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:45,000
this is day five of the medical medium

17
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:47,280
brain shot therapy cleanse Challenge and

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,879
I really like the anger shifter because

19
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,980
if you've been betrayed or Something's

20
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:55,760
Happened where you've just gotten really

21
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:58,079
mad maybe you're dealing with

22
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,120
emotions and they come up and they

23
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,820
Bumble up and they they Bubble Up and

24
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,619
you get mad anyway you get upset anyway

25
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,780
and you feel like it's out of your

26
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:08,640
control the anger shifter is a great

27
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:10,260
tool so this is a medical medium tool

28
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,880
this is day five of the brain shot

29
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,439
therapy cleanse challenge we're doing

30
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,420
the anger shifter today but I'm going to

31
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,159
read about what happens inside of our

32
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:21,000
brain when we get angry what happens

33
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:22,979
inside of our head when we get angry

34
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,500
so it's really important information

35
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:27,240
critical information to anyone who's

36
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,340
struggling with some kind of mood

37
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:31,460
disorder too where you're getting pissed

38
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:34,920
off and angry all the time or frustrated

39
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:36,720
constantly frustrated or maybe you're

40
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,640
trying to beat out that frustration and

41
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,320
anger and you're moving along okay and

42
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,360
then someone trips you up and you get

43
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,759
triggered that's another thing too

44
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,659
everybody seems to be getting triggered

45
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:47,579
now

46
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:49,320
and getting triggered along the way and

47
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:51,420
that's interfering with them so they're

48
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,159
getting angry because they're triggered

49
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:55,560
and they get triggered into the anger

50
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:57,479
then the anger makes them more triggered

51
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,040
then the triggered makes them more angry

52
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:00,600
and now they're in a vicious cycle and

53
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,520
they can't get out of it and it's like

54
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,880
how do I break this anger how do I break

55
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:08,220
this anger or what if you got OCD

56
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:10,560
OCD is a whole other thing if you're

57
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,840
struggling with obsessive thoughts and

58
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,239
you can't break them and it's making you

59
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:18,239
angrier and more frustrated and more

60
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:20,700
upset and what happens there right

61
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,340
that's a whole other problem too so many

62
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:26,819
people have

63
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:28,680
OCD and it becomes a vicious cycle where

64
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:31,260
it's like it's over and over again it's

65
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,239
like you got the obsessive thoughts you

66
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:34,739
can't stop the obsessive thoughts you

67
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:36,120
know you need to stop them so you can

68
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:37,920
have some peace in your heart for the

69
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,080
moment peace in your mind and then you

70
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,599
get upset because you can't stop them

71
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,459
and then you're angry and then it's bet

72
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:46,739
it's like it's getting triggered and

73
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:50,340
it's Recycling and it's this Catch-22

74
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:53,040
right so many people struggle with anger

75
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:55,680
in so many ways and so many different

76
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,819
having different complications with it

77
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,800
too so I'm going to talk about what

78
00:02:56,819 --> 00:03:01,379
happens inside this brain right here

79
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,959
your brain our brain

80
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:06,180
what happens in the brain when we get

81
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:08,580
angry I'm going to read about that we're

82
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:09,840
going to do the anger shifter too so

83
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:14,159
let's get into it now let's start

84
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:19,280
reading about it let's roll into it

85
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:19,280
so I'm going to go to page 30 I think

86
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:25,440
I am looking for page 30. there we are

87
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:26,879
page 31 right here brain saver you guys

88
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,739
this is going to be really important

89
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:31,200
information imperative information for

90
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:32,760
anybody who's struggling or suffering

91

with

92
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:40,500
chronic mystery anger or anger bouts or

93
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:43,379
frustration bouts or maybe you're

94

been depressed for a while

96
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:49,379
and then you have that burst of anger

97
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,060
and then you cry and then now you're

98
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:53,099
depressed again

99
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:55,560
and then you're angry the next day and

100
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:58,620
it keeps on going so many people have

101
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:00,780
this issue so many people are struggling

102
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:03,060
so there's a section in brain saver

103
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:06,360
called melting down

104
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:09,540
and it's page 30 right here I really

105
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:11,099
need the anger shifter today actually I

106
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:13,019
would love to have the anger shifter

107
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:14,519
today that'd be fantastic

108
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:15,959
there's people out there that are

109
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:20,579
struggling with

110
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:23,520
Untold unbalanced Untold unknown bouts

111
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:25,979
of mystery anger at different times of

112
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:28,680
of the day different times of the week

113
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:31,020
the month for so many and this is so

114
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:33,419
helpful let's talk about melting down

115
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:35,699
what does that mean melting down

116
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:36,660
it's a meltdown right we're having a

117
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:40,220
meltdown

118
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:40,220
when our brains get hot

119
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:44,580
and there's metal involved I'm talking

120
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:46,740
about toxic heavy metals a little bit

121
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:49,380
because this is important

122
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:51,300
because so many people you can be angry

123
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:53,460
and frustrated not have toxic heavy

124
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:55,440
metals inside the brain but so many

125
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,520
people do have toxic heavy metals inside

126
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,139
the brain

127
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:00,060
they really do this is Advanced

128
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:02,100
information it's Unique information from

129
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:06,479
above just so you know it's in the brain

130
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:09,180
saver books published here first

131
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:11,520
it's incredible info when our brains get

132
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:13,979
hot and there's metal involved the toxic

133
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,600
heavy metal particles break down

134
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:17,100
think about that

135
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,259
how incredible that piece of information

136
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:21,720
is since research doesn't know that

137
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:24,419
alternative medicine doesn't know that

138
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:27,900
when our brains get hot

139
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:30,020
and there's metal involved the toxic

140
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:32,580
heavy metal particles

141
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:37,139
yacto particles

142
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:38,940
the tiny particles nanoparticles

143
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:41,520
break down

144
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:43,800
the metals melt

145
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,940
did you hear that you guys the metals

146
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,539
melt

147
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:50,940
these tiny nanoparticles septoparticles

148
00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:53,460
the active particles whatever these tiny

149
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:56,580
particles melt

150
00:05:53,460 --> 00:06:00,600
every time a brain gets hot

151
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:03,180
the metals melt inside of our brain

152
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:05,220
toxic heavy metals in the brain get wear

153
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:07,500
and tear

154
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:08,759
when electrical currents are entering

155
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,979
them

156
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:13,740
all the electricity in your brain you

157
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:17,520
guys has to hit

158
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:21,000
every bit of metal that's in our brain

159
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:22,740
Mercury copper lead arsenic

160
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,280
aluminum

161
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:29,699
cadmium nickel right

162
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:33,979
we have metal in our brains toxic heavy

163
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:35,819
metals and electrical currents

164
00:06:33,979 --> 00:06:39,900
entering

165
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:42,180
arm like our neurons are hitting these

166
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:43,560
metals and they're giving them wear and

167
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:45,539
tear

168
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:50,300
and when that happens

169
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:50,300
the metals start to change

170
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:54,960
their shapes change

171
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:58,319
this is incredible information when I

172
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:01,919
was writing this information down

173
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:04,979
through the painstaking process

174
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:08,039
that I desperately needed anger shifter

175
00:07:04,979 --> 00:07:09,720
the anger shifter at that time right

176
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:12,180
this information is so incredible

177
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:14,819
there's a comment on IG

178
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:18,360
let's see Boheme says my ayurvedic

179
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:20,160
teacher taught me this I beg to differ

180
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,960
that's for sure

181
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:25,259
somebody else said oh the same person

182
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:27,419
said stop claiming you're the first

183
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:29,819
your ayurvedic practitioner did not

184
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:32,639
teach you what I'm telling you it was

185
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:34,860
never published anywhere it's Unique and

186
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:38,220
original I know

187
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:41,039
that's hard to take in I'm gonna need

188
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:42,539
the anger shifter today you know I know

189
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,520
that's really hard to take in and hard

190
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:46,560
to digest

191
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:48,479
but the medical medium books are all

192
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,479
from above

193
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:54,620
my publisher has no requirements for me

194
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:58,020
to create any citations because it's not

195
00:07:54,620 --> 00:08:00,240
taken from any sources here in the

196
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:02,639
Alternative Health World on any level

197
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:06,240
so your ayurvedic doctor

198
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:08,940
does not know that electricity melts

199
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,740
yacto particles of metals in your brain

200
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:12,660
nobody did

201
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:14,460
your ayurvedic practitioner didn't know

202
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:16,319
about toxic heavy metals I spent 35

203
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:17,520
years teaching about it and how they

204
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,080
work in the brain and how to get them

205
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,120
out of the brain and body that

206
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:23,039
information is unknown to research in

207
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:26,419
science so unless you're ayurvedic

208
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:28,740
medicine doctor is making it up

209
00:08:26,419 --> 00:08:30,599
there's no study that shows it or

210
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:32,219
anything of the sort in their teachings

211
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:35,339
or any other teachings

212
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:37,440
I'm not dissing alternative medicine

213
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:39,300
whether you're naturopathic

214
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,399
acupuncturist an ayurvedic doctor or

215
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:44,060
whoever you are the information is

216
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:44,060
unique and original

217
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,200
and that's just a fact

218
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:51,600
anyway I appreciate though you're saying

219
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,820
that

220
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,440
because it actually at least gives me a

221
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:57,180
chance to talk about how incredible this

222
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,920
information is how it's original how

223
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:00,920
it's Unique and how amazing that is

224
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:06,480
a publisher

225
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:10,220
would never let this out

226
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,220
if it wasn't original and unique

227
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,820
that's how it works

228
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:17,399
it would all have to be cited to all its

229
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:21,560
sources to all the different sources out

230
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:21,560
there if it wasn't original and unique

231
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:27,480
enough with the fun let's get into let's

232
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,220
talk about the powerful bits of

233
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,660
information on here

234
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:32,700
pieces of information Phyllis is

235
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:34,380
absolutely fascinating when peeps claim

236
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:36,120
they've heard it before just fascinating

237
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:37,800
I know there's a reason for that there's

238
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:41,160
a bunch of reasons for that I can go

239
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:42,959
into all that someday but some do it on

240
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,519
purpose because they heard Metals before

241
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:47,420
from somebody so they think everybody

242
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:47,420
knows about it

243
00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:54,000
does not know a lot and they have a lot

244
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:57,180
of misinformation I agree with you same

245
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,519
with TCM in fact they say the opposite I

246
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:02,060
agree 100 that's accurate that's really

247
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,060
accurate

248
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,120
all right

249
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:08,220
and maybe somebody's ayurvedic

250
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:10,260
practitioner purchased the medical

251
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:12,120
medium books maybe they purchased

252
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:14,160
medical media maybe they purchased

253
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,480
cleans a heel maybe they purchased Liver

254
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,339
Rescue maybe they purchased

255
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,560
life-changing foods and they learned

256
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:23,220
about something from their

257
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:26,160
and incorporated or maybe a patient came

258
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:28,260
into the ayurvedic doctor's office with

259
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,940
a book or just with the information and

260
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:32,459
just started talking about metals and

261
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:34,500
metals in the brain mm info and that's

262
00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:38,660
how they heard it

263
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:38,660
but it's all original and unique

264
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:43,860
the metals

265
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:46,019
change shape when electricity is hitting

266
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:47,279
them and then corrosion can can occur

267
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:48,920
first of all there's no signs of

268
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:52,019
research or anything

269
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:54,600
anywhere that talks about the metals the

270
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:58,040
active part-sized metals particles in

271
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,040
the brain corroding

272
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:04,740
no one knew anywhere on this planet on

273
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:08,339
this Earth

274
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:10,920
that corrosion occurs to nanoparticle

275
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:13,560
sized Metals in the brain

276
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:16,740
nobody knew that corrosion occurred to

277
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:19,459
them this is just one out of whatever

278
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:19,459
it's in here

279
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:27,240
I need the anger shifter shot today they

280
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,620
don't want me to be able to claim my own

281
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:31,320
information

282
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:33,779
isn't that hilarious they don't want me

283
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:36,959
to claim my own information from above

284
00:11:33,779 --> 00:11:39,839
they want me to be silenced they want to

285
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:42,660
make it like they can that I can't stick

286
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:44,579
up for myself or stick up for the

287
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:46,320
information that's so powerful

288
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:49,260
they they want to take the information

289
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:51,240
though from me and then

290
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:52,740
and then just basically tell me that I

291
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,240
don't know what I'm talking about and

292
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:56,820
it's already out there

293
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,800
and it keeps people from coming to it

294
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:00,420
right that's the reason they do it it

295
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:04,820
stops people

296
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:04,820
from coming to this information

297
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:09,200
it's amazing

298
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:14,940
the smaller of the particles the more

299
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:16,260
easily they melt under the heat of the

300
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:19,079
brain

301
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:21,240
so metal changes shape in the brain and

302
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:23,220
the tinier the particles the easier they

303
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,800
melt inside the brain

304
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:27,899
they transform into a liquid gas

305
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:31,040
chemical composition I'm sorry but that

306
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:31,040
information is not out there

307
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:38,519
that is the metals change from a solid

308
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:40,500
to a liquid gas and can spread and cover

309
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:42,480
more ground inside the brain more easily

310
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:44,760
because I have a real publisher behind

311
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,339
me right it's not independently

312
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:49,700
published I can't just put any old

313
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:49,700
in here

314
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:55,639
cite the source

315
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,639
I have a real publisher

316
00:12:55,800 --> 00:13:01,459
I can't just put information in here if

317
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:01,459
I took it somewhere else

318
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:07,200
I would have to cite it

319
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:09,420
your serious responsibilities

320
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,200
that go along with all of this right

321
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,880
here

322
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,680
in these books

323
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,880
if I was independently published and I

324
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,320
wanted to put out anything and

325
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,480
everything and steal whatever I want to

326
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,360
steal that's one thing

327
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,100
but I can't do that this is all unique

328
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,399
and original

329
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:28,440
you guys have we even started yet

330
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:30,420
when toxic heavy metals reside inside

331
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:32,700
the brain and they melt you guys heavy

332
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:34,560
metals that reside in the brain they can

333
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:36,839
transform into a liquid gas chemical

334
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:40,459
composition the metals in your brain can

335
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:40,459
literally turn into liquid gas

336
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:46,339
Hannity I think uh Dr Nesbit showing up

337
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,339
today later

338
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:52,820
Metals change from a solid to a liquid

339
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:58,620
Madeline Scott if the info wasn't true

340
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,459
why would they say it's already out

341
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:02,040
there

342
00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:04,459
both can't be true thank you for sharing

343
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:07,920
the truth with this aw

344
00:14:04,459 --> 00:14:09,240
it's a powerful comment

345
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,700
you know what I love about the medical

346
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:14,579
meaning community

347
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:16,380
you guys actually understand you're

348
00:14:14,579 --> 00:14:19,200
smart you're seasoned

349
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:20,639
your intelligence level is just off the

350
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:23,220
charts

351
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,600
you guys are smarter than me many of the

352
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:26,760
people in the community are way smarter

353
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,019
than me I'm a messenger I hear the

354
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,940
information I write it down word for

355
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:31,680
word but that doesn't make me a really

356
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:33,420
highly intelligent guy there's some

357
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:36,860
incredibly smart people in the medical

358
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:36,860
medium Community it blows my mind

359
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:41,279
but their games will all make you crazy

360
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:44,519
out there the games that they play

361
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:47,100
you know there are no real studies

362
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:48,600
from any of it but they'll like post

363
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:50,459
they'll post somebody will put a link to

364
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,260
a blog post of something that mentions

365
00:14:50,459 --> 00:14:53,699
metal

366
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:55,860
and then all of a sudden there's the

367
00:14:53,699 --> 00:14:58,040
answer but there's no even answer in

368
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:58,040
there

369
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:01,880
all right

370
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:07,019
toxic heavy metals when they get hit

371
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:12,079
with electricity and your brain heats up

372
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:12,079
turns from a solid to a liquid gas

373
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:16,800
science also publishes papers and

374
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:19,320
theories

375
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:21,000
they just study they just publish papers

376
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,100
and theories that are written by people

377
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,420
that steal medical medium information by

378
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:27,959
the way

379
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:31,380
and they also they also backdate

380
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:33,120
and change and edit articles they take

381
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:35,399
medical meme information now did you

382
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,560
know this and they back date

383
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:39,180
articles articles that we have

384
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:43,380
screenshot

385
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:45,779
they came out in like 2019 what they do

386
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:47,459
is they literally change the date to use

387
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:49,500
the same article and then take the date

388
00:15:47,459 --> 00:15:52,339
off and make it look like it's older

389
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,339
they do that too

390
00:15:52,579 --> 00:15:58,440
we have so much data from so much of the

391
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:00,959
trickery and the clinics are taking

392
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:03,420
medical meme information every day right

393
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:06,300
now with no studies behind them they're

394
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:08,040
taking the mm info all the clinics right

395
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:10,220
now have the medical medium brain saver

396
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:13,620
books and they have

397
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:15,240
clinicians reading them extracting from

398
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:17,699
it

399
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:19,680
and trying to publish it on their sites

400
00:16:17,699 --> 00:16:22,019
when there's no studies behind it and

401
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:24,199
never existed before

402
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:24,199
foreign

403
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,339
but there's no darkness in this world

404
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:33,839
Metals change from a solid to a liquid

405
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:35,399
gas and can spread and cover more ground

406
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,740
inside the brain more easily what that

407
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:40,440
means is when the when the metal heats

408
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:42,600
up and it turns

409
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:45,500
from a solid to a liquid it can spread

410
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,500
throughout the brain more

411
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:49,019
and then you hear all the fork tongue

412
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:52,440
out there

413
00:16:49,019 --> 00:16:53,880
remember that word for tongue

414
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:57,240
because

415
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:59,040
there's a crap ton of it going on now

416
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:01,620
and then the media is never nice to

417
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:03,839
Medical medium we know that how many hit

418
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:06,000
pieces have been out there on me

419
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:08,520
it's unbelievable

420
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,959
it's unbelievable what's happening out

421
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,640
there

422
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:13,079
there's a new hit piece on medical

423
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:16,799
medium

424
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:19,020
like in the media every month

425
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:20,640
and the it's just you know and that's

426
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:22,199
what's crazy media can say whatever they

427
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,419
want it's all false they can say

428
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:27,740
whatever they want

429
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:27,740
it's actually sick

430
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,660
hey this is really great because you

431
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:36,120
know what we're doing the anchor shifter

432
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:37,860
today so we should talk about all this

433
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:40,559
crap that's going down that's really

434
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:42,240
frustrating and then we can do like an

435
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,860
experiment which can get me as

436
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,600
frustrated as possible out on this

437
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:49,520
information and then I'll I'll send down

438
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,520
the anger shifter it'll be fun

439
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:53,820
let's see draw says this is my first

440
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,799
time watching in medical medium live

441
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:57,780
video after just purchasing the celery

442
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:59,940
juice book are they always like this no

443
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:02,039
they're not always like this

444
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:04,260
this is the brain shot therapy cleanse

445
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:06,840
challenge this is different so if you're

446
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:08,760

join this free cleanse challenge right

457
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:29,280
here we're doing 20 days we're having

458
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,080
some fun

459
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,660
we're talking about some of the stuff

460
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:34,799
going on and when you read the books

461
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:37,799
you'll you'll see like the information

462
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:40,799
is just mind-blowing it's incredible

463
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:44,100
all right so we all have toxic heavy

464
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:46,679
metals in our head the particle size the

465
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:49,080
smaller the particle size is

466
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:52,140
then the change the composition of that

467
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:54,679
metal changes so that metal then melts

468
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:57,480
turns into from a solid to a liquid form

469
00:18:54,679 --> 00:18:59,580
the hotter your brain gets and for

470
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:01,380
example if you're angry

471
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:04,080
if you're mad

472
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:06,419
the matter you get the more Angry you

473
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:08,460
get or the amount of stress you could be

474
00:19:06,419 --> 00:19:11,700
under the brain heats up when the brain

475
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:15,679
heats up it then transforms

476
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:19,500
solid particles of metal like yacto size

477
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:22,140
septocise Nano size it transforms them

478
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:25,559
into a liquid gas then that metal

479
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:28,140
actually travels through neurons and

480
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:30,440
brain tissue worsening a condition over

481
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,440
time

482
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:39,799
they move and they slowly travel to

483
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:39,799
adjacent brain tissue over the years

484
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:44,100
melting toxic heavy metals in the brain

485
00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:45,539
are one reason why so many conditions

486
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:47,580
and symptoms like Alzheimer's for

487
00:19:45,539 --> 00:19:50,100
example worsened with time the gas alone

488
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:52,320
can worsen any mental physical or

489
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:53,700
emotional condition so someone has any

490
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:57,000
kind of issue

491
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:59,580
whether it's brain fog confusion focus

492
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,799
and concentration issues whether it's

493
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:03,059
Alzheimer's dementia whether it's none

494
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:04,860
of that then they're just dealing with

495
00:20:03,059 --> 00:20:07,760
some depression right

496
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:10,679
if the metals are actually moving about

497
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:12,000
it changes the symptoms too that's why

498
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:13,320
someone's psychiatrist would be like

499
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,900
well how come you know it's different

500
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:17,640
than it was a year ago how come it's

501
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:20,240
different than it was two years ago they

502
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:24,200
don't know meanwhile metals are melting

503
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,200
transforming and moving around

504
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:30,780
another reason brain conditions worsen

505
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:32,280
with time is that more toxic heavy

506
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:34,260
metals continue to collect in certain

507
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:37,380
areas of the brain

508
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:40,740
the brain's electromagnetic field draws

509
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:44,840
Metals in I'm on page 30 of brain saver

510
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:44,840
people keep on asking where am I

511
00:20:48,299 --> 00:20:53,059
so toxic heavy metals

512
00:20:51,179 --> 00:20:55,200
get attracted to the electric

513
00:20:53,059 --> 00:20:57,679
electromagnetic field that the brain

514
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,679
causes

515
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:03,840
that electromagnetic field draws metal

516
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:05,880
in creating an accumulation effect that

517
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:08,600
makes large deposits of toxic heavy

518
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:11,580
metals keep growing so our

519
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:13,140
electromagnetic field pulls Metals into

520
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:14,760
the deposits that are happening inside

521
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:17,220
the brain that are collecting inside the

522
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:18,900
brain building these deposits bigger and

523
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:20,220
bigger that's another thing that happens

524
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:22,559
too

525
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:25,380
especially if we're angry all the time

526
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:27,780
and we're melting the particles and the

527
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:29,820
particles are going from a solid to a

528
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:32,760
liquid form and then hardening back up

529
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:34,919
into a solid form they eventually can go

530
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:36,539
and find other metal deposits like

531
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:41,000
Mercury

532
00:21:36,539 --> 00:21:41,000
so Mercury can find Mercury this way

533
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:46,799
as mercury melts

534
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:50,400
it can transform into a gas and then

535
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:52,020
move as it's moving and we're angry and

536
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:55,080
that electricity is going through our

537
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:58,020
brain an electromagnetic field can draw

538
00:21:55,080 --> 00:22:00,860
the mercury in even more collecting into

539
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,860
a deposit

540
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:07,860
um creating an accumulation effect that

541
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:10,440
makes large deposits of toxic heavy

542
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:13,140
metals keep growing the larger the

543
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:15,000
deposit the greater its electromagnetic

544
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:17,340
pool so that's another thing too the

545
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,280
larger the deposit of metal aluminum

546
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:22,200
Mercury lead arsenic cadmium nickel

547
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:25,140
building up in the brain the larger the

548
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:29,100
deposit that's inside our brain

549
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:31,740
the more electromagnetic pull it has so

550
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:34,500
that metal deposit inside somebody's

551
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:35,940
brain whether it's the left hemisphere

552
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:38,820
the right hemisphere frontal lobe

553
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:40,620
whatever wherever it's residing the

554
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:43,440
brain stem

555
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:44,760
it's going to draw more

556
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,280
metal

557
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:50,220
to that deposit it's going to be a

558
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:52,799
stronger electromagnetic field

559
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:55,559
it will keep attracting toxic heavy

560
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:57,539
metals into it making the deposit larger

561
00:22:55,559 --> 00:22:59,760
and larger over time because that's what

562
00:22:57,539 --> 00:23:03,059
happens to people if you don't get the

563
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:05,760
metals out of your brain

564
00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:09,020
the deposits will keep growing and

565
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,020
growing and growing

566
00:23:09,059 --> 00:23:14,340
and that gets us in trouble because if

567
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:16,919
we're not being at if we're not actively

568
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:19,200
getting the metals out of our brain and

569
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:22,520
the metal deposits are growing larger

570
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,520
inside of our brain

571
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:29,100
then there's more corrosion that current

572
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:30,840
occurs within that big deposit

573
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:32,520
and then we end up getting Alzheimer's

574
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:34,559
down the road

575
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:37,080
Tamara Jones says

576
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:39,179
there is high level competition among

577
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:41,220
scientists to get grants yes and their

578
00:23:39,179 --> 00:23:43,559
careers ride on this yes the lying is

579
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:45,480
rampant true 100 percent

580
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:47,520
and they're also hungry for new

581
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:50,940
information so they take it from the

582
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:52,500
little medical medium and we know this

583
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:55,080
if someone's doubting that it's actually

584
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:57,240
factual we have evidence for instance

585
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:59,159
the publication of multiple sclerosis

586
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:02,460
being caused by Epstein-Barr and then

587
00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:03,960
Harvard took that info and published it

588
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:05,580
eight years later after medical medium

589
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:09,320
already published it

590
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:09,320
and I taught about it for years too

591
00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:16,580
so we have

592
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:16,580
lots of evidence of that

593
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:22,020
while the brain's electromagnetic field

594
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:24,120
is drawing toxic heavy metals into other

595
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:25,679
areas of the brain too the metals tend

596
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:28,740
to accumulate where the field is

597
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:30,600
stronger due to these nuggets nuggets

598
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:33,000
you know about gold nuggets

599
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:35,900
right gold nuggets everybody wants a

600
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,900
gold nugget

601
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:40,980
all the miners the gold miners are

602
00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:43,980
looking for gold

603
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:46,260
always want gold nuggets

604
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:49,140
well we get in our head instead of gold

605
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:51,360
nuggets we get Mercury nuggets we get

606
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:54,419
nickel nuggets we get aluminum nuggets

607
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:56,100
we get copper nuggets Jackie B good to

608
00:24:54,419 --> 00:24:58,380
see you hey at least if we're pissed

609
00:24:56,100 --> 00:25:00,720
beforehand we'll feel it working laugh

610
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:02,760
out loud and I can't wait that's exactly

611
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:05,039
true like I think I'm getting you guys

612
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:07,799
all riled up by accident or something

613
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:09,960
because I'm getting riled up

614
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:12,480
Hannah T been on heavy metal detox

615
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:14,340
smoothie for three years and now in the

616
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:17,220
metal exposure shots I'm getting medals

617
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:20,280
out like crazy my mental state has

618
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:24,720
improved a thousand fold Hannity there's

619
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:27,720
a guest coming on later to say hi to you

620
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,720
doctor

621
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:36,120
when it comes to Mercury deposits

622
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:39,120
they're not just formed through

623
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:40,799
electromagnetic Pole

624
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,779
Mercury doesn't need this

625
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:44,159
electromagnetic field to accumulate in

626
00:25:42,779 --> 00:25:46,919
the brain so Mercury is one of those

627
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:49,380
rare metals that doesn't need the

628
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:52,500
electromagnetic electromagnetic field in

629
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:54,720
our brain to grab onto an additional

630
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:56,039
metal and bring it in and create that

631
00:25:54,720 --> 00:26:01,640
nugget

632
00:25:56,039 --> 00:26:01,640
Mercury finds Mercury on its own

633
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:08,039
and

634
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:10,260
hence it says it right here Mercury

635
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:12,299
finds Mercury on its own

636
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:15,840
with Mercury deposits forming in the

637
00:26:12,299 --> 00:26:18,960
brain both from electromagnetic

638
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:21,600
nature and from Mercury's tendency to

639
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:23,760
find Mercury Mercury deposits are that

640
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,740
much more of a hindrance so what happens

641
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:27,360
with people with Alzheimer's dementia

642
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:30,179
what happens with people

643
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:32,340
with the personalization with depression

644
00:26:30,179 --> 00:26:34,200
with severe anxiety severe depression

645
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:38,460
what happens with people with bipolar

646
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:41,039
and OCD Mercury deposits they're a big

647
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:43,799
nuisance because Mercury finds Mercury

648
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:46,200
easily without even our electromagnetic

649
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:49,020
field doing it so Mercury finds Mercury

650
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:50,820
easy so Mercury deposits become bigger

651
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:52,980
in our brains that's why it's critical

652
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:57,500
to get those Mercury deposits out

653
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:57,500
because they're really a hindrance

654
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:04,980
scientists need a hypotheses

655
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:06,419
to do anything with to even attempt to

656
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:08,340
do anything

657
00:27:06,419 --> 00:27:10,860
where do where do they get their

658
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:12,900
hypotheses I'd like to know well from

659
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:15,000
medical medium all the time

660
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:17,600
that

661
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,600
that

662
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:22,820
when it comes to Mercury deposits

663
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:25,320
they're not just formed through

664
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:27,120
electromagnetic fields as I said Mercury

665
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:28,980
finds itself important thing to remember

666
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:31,620
if we're experiencing a lot of friction

667
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:34,740
and stress in our lives

668
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:36,840
yeah what electricity travels through

669
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:39,320
our brain at a higher intensity and

670
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,320
velocity

671
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:47,039
so for under stress electricity travels

672
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:49,380
through our brain at a higher velocity

673
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:51,539
a higher intensity

674
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:53,760
because adrenaline here science and

675
00:27:51,539 --> 00:27:56,580
researchers know this check this out

676
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:58,919
because adrenaline both increases heart

677
00:27:56,580 --> 00:28:02,059
rate and enters the brain raising the

678
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:06,299
brain's heat levels

679
00:28:02,059 --> 00:28:08,640
adrenaline raises the brain's heat

680
00:28:06,299 --> 00:28:10,320
levels

681
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,580
I remember when I was writing that down

682
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:14,100
and I heard that piece of information

683
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:16,940
from above right from SOC I was just

684
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,940
like Blown Away

685
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:22,980
so when we're under stress electricity

686
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:25,740
is running through our brain in that

687
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:28,200
high velocity and high intensity

688
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:31,799
and it raises the heat levels but

689
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:34,320
adrenaline contributes to

690
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:38,059
because it increases the heart rate and

691
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:38,059
that adrenaline then enters the brain

692
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:42,539
the more toxic heavy metals in the brain

693
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:44,940
the hotter it runs

694
00:28:42,539 --> 00:28:47,400
so here's another problem the more metal

695
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:50,299
we have in our brains the hotter our

696
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,299
brains run

697
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:55,020
the more metal particles we have

698
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:58,279
throughout our brain the hotter our

699
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:58,279
brain is

700
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:05,520
and remember this Metals retain heat

701
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,900
metal retains

702
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,820
Heat

703
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:11,100
that's so important to know it could

704
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:12,360
become a vicious cycle I don't like this

705
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:14,880
vicious cycle

706
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:17,580
for instance someone who's

707
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:20,460
perpetually angry about anything and

708
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:23,820
everything we're talking about anger

709
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:26,520
someone who's always angry about

710
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:30,720
anything and everything

711
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:33,539
or who has frequent spells of anger

712
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:35,659
may have higher levels of toxic heavy

713
00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:38,580
metals in the brain in the first place

714
00:29:35,659 --> 00:29:40,500
and that's aggravating the anger and I

715
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:43,200
talked about that earlier right the more

716
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:45,539
metal we have in our brain the more it

717
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:48,919
makes us frustrated and angry the more

718
00:29:45,539 --> 00:29:48,919
we have bouts of anger

719
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:53,700
the more bouts of anger we have the more

720
00:29:51,899 --> 00:29:55,679
we're heating up the battles it's this

721
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:58,340
vicious cycle that keeps on going over

722
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:58,340
and over again

723
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:07,380
as he is generated for any reason the

724
00:30:05,159 --> 00:30:09,840
metals change shape and form those anger

725
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:11,700
spells will then generate more heat as

726
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:15,000
anger raises the electrical field

727
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:16,980
creating an electrical storm

728
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:20,340
what you'll notice when someone's really

729
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:22,919
angry and they got medals involved an

730
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:24,960
electrical storm happens inside their

731
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:27,419
brain grid

732
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:29,279
which in turn melts more metal so that

733
00:30:27,419 --> 00:30:30,899
it spreads and has the potential to

734
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:32,880
interfere with even more electrical

735
00:30:30,899 --> 00:30:34,380
signals in the brain that's the Vicious

736
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,460
Cycle about it that's why it's critical

737
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:37,380
to

738
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:39,120
be on anchor shifter if you're angry all

739
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:40,980
the time the other thing is it's

740
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:43,520
critical to know this so you can get the

741
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:43,520
metals out

742
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:48,720
which in turn melts more metal so that

743
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:50,279
it spreads and the potential to

744
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,380
interfere with more electrical signals

745
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:54,600
in the brain those melting toxic heavy

746
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:56,520
metal spreading through spreading their

747
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:58,440
liquid gas can hinder bodily functions

748
00:30:56,520 --> 00:31:02,240
and communication I see so many people

749
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:05,720
out there suffering so bad

750
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:09,000
suffering emotionally suffering mentally

751
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:11,760
suffering physically just

752
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,260
just plain out suffering and they're

753
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:15,360
stuck in these Vicious Cycles of

754
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:16,860
depression and frustration and anger

755
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:20,520
then depression and sadness to

756
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:23,460
frustration and anger then then OCD then

757
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:26,640
bipolar frustration Mania then anger

758
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:30,539
than just all of it like they're stuck

759
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:34,440
in it and no one's telling them no one's

760
00:31:30,539 --> 00:31:36,779
teaching them the cause of this is toxic

761
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:39,960
heavy metals you have mercury you have

762
00:31:36,779 --> 00:31:42,480
aluminum you have copper you have nickel

763
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:45,659
you have lead in the brain and it's not

764
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:48,059
findable unless someone cuts open your

765
00:31:45,659 --> 00:31:49,559
brain and puts it under a microscope and

766
00:31:48,059 --> 00:31:51,419
they're not going to do that because

767
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:52,380
they don't want to find metal in the

768
00:31:51,419 --> 00:31:55,500
brain

769
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:57,720
if the industry finds metal inside our

770
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:59,880
brains the industry would be blamed for

771
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:01,620
it because those Metals will go back the

772
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:03,000
forensics will show where those Metals

773
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:04,799
go back to in a lot of its

774
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,039
Pharmaceuticals

775
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:12,600
because Pharmaceuticals use a branding

776
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:15,240
type of metal an industrial metal that's

777
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:17,520
different than other metals and if that

778
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:19,799
was ever distinguished it would show

779
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:22,279
pharmaceutical Metals inside of our

780
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:22,279
brains

781
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:27,240
so so the science of research doesn't

782
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:29,760
want to know metals are inside our

783
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:31,320
brains they just let people stay sick

784
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,820
and sick and sick till down the road

785
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:34,020
they end up dying down the road or

786
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:35,279
something for some reason they're never

787
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:37,799
going to cut open their brain and look

788
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:40,860
and say oh whoa what's all this metal

789
00:32:37,799 --> 00:32:42,779
doing here in the brain tissue hmm why

790
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:44,760
is the brain stem filled with metal hmm

791
00:32:42,779 --> 00:32:46,500
what kind of metal is this well it looks

792
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:49,620
like an industrial variety of metal

793
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:52,039
that's used in Pharmaceuticals

794
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:55,260
foreign

795
00:32:52,039 --> 00:32:57,059
on YouTube thanks let's see what does

796
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:59,580
this comment say from Omar this is

797
00:32:57,059 --> 00:33:02,179

here

801
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:11,279
you're wondering if this is a normal

802
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:13,440
medical medium

803
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:16,019
this is a normal medical medium live

804
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:18,840
we're live right now by the way

805
00:33:16,019 --> 00:33:20,760
this isn't pre-recorded

806
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:22,140
if this is normal I don't know if this

807
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:24,120
is normal

808
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:25,799
but check out medical meme podcasts at

809
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:27,600
Apple podcast when you get a chance and

810
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:28,799
listen to all my podcast episodes if

811
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:31,039
you're brand new to Medical beam

812
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:31,039
information

813
00:33:36,539 --> 00:33:40,640
all right let's keep on going just

814
00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:44,519
looking into the info here

815
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:46,799
people know stress and anger as bad for

816
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:49,620
our brain and body and health we do know

817
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:51,360
that too much stress not good give you a

818
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:53,700
headache

819
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:56,820
those in the health world don't know why

820
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:59,059
they're bad for our health

821
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:59,059
foreign

822
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:05,700
it is innately known out there that too

823
00:34:03,299 --> 00:34:08,580
much anger and too much stress isn't

824
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:10,919
good for our body that's known out there

825
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:14,940
but those in the health world don't know

826
00:34:10,919 --> 00:34:18,320
why we're talking about why

827
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:22,700
that's all about the mm info it's why

828
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:22,700
how where what

829
00:34:25,859 --> 00:34:30,599
they don't know what systematically is

830
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:33,000
at the root of it they don't know about

831
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:35,399
the process occurring inside of our

832
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,679
brain the health world has no idea how

833
00:34:35,399 --> 00:34:39,540
anger affects the brain in this way they

834
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:42,480
don't know why even with the best

835
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:44,460
Neuroscience techniques meditations and

836
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,440
thought pattern construction which is

837
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:48,659
all great and all mastering the mind is

838
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:50,580
a struggle for so many wise strategies

839
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:53,460
for managing stress and anger patterns

840
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:55,740
can fail and why people fall back to Old

841
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:58,700
patterns we don't know why

842
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:58,700
why

843
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:04,020
this is why

844
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:07,380
people struggle because of the toxic

845
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:10,320
heavy metals Underneath It All

846
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:12,180
trying to hack or rewire our minds leads

847
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,500
us back to the same old patterns if

848
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:15,599
toxic heavy metals are not being

849
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:17,640
addressed at the same time

850
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:19,380
there are people in the medical medium

851
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:21,500
community over the years

852
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:25,380
that have healed

853
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:28,079
their emotional

854
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:30,680
struggles through just ridding Metals

855
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:34,140
out of their brain

856
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:37,859
allowing them to play in meditation land

857
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:40,140
again allowing them to play in the

858
00:35:37,859 --> 00:35:42,240
spiritual world again allowing them to

859
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:45,420
do these things because

860
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:48,420
they were healed the medals got out of

861
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:51,180
their brain and the natural process that

862
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:53,040
followed was beautiful The Details

863
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:56,060
Matter

864
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:56,060
with all of this

865
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:01,680
if you don't get the medals out of your

866
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:04,760
brain

867
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:06,960
you can be

868
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:11,540
seeking help

869
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:11,540
for your emotional torment forever

870
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:15,359
a whole lifetime of doing it 30 40 50

871
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:17,700
years

872
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:19,980
Hennis says no other modality worked

873
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:22,380
when I was dying with botox poisoning

874
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:24,300
people don't talk about Botox Botox

875
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:26,160
poisoning enough out there

876
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:28,859
I just don't

877
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:31,440
only medical medium info works if you

878
00:36:28,859 --> 00:36:33,660
are too sick and that the details matter

879
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:35,400
right there if you are too sick

880
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:36,780
Hannah thank you for writing this

881
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:39,960
comment

882
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:43,140
I am forever grateful to have found UAW

883
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:45,180
thank you so much aw and SOC

884
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:47,400
people don't talk about Botox poisoning

885
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:48,900
enough how bad it really is meaning how

886
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:50,400
many people have suffered from Botox

887
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:52,560
poisoning

888
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,880
holy cow and the needle doesn't always

889
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:56,579
land right

890
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:58,680
when they when they apply Botox

891
00:36:56,579 --> 00:37:00,480
it's like sure you know

892
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:01,560
okay I'm ready I'm in the chair it's

893
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,960
like

894
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:06,720
oh

895
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:08,579
okay it's in there pull it out

896
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:11,119
and

897
00:37:08,579 --> 00:37:11,119
right

898
00:37:12,839 --> 00:37:15,500
but anyway

899
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:23,760
sure you know it's like botulism variety

900
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:26,520
of pharmaceuticals right

901
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:30,320
cosmetic botulism use people don't talk

902
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:30,320
about cosmetic botulism use

903
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:35,160
all right

904
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:36,660
let's move on a little bit

905
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:39,140
yeah

906
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:41,400
thank you for dealing with me

907
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:43,680
reading through all of this I really

908
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:46,560
appreciate you guys your patience too

909
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:48,839
Iona says McLeod says I healed extreme

910
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:51,240
OCD whoa just knowing that you went

911
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:53,940
through extreme OCD it's just terrible

912
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:56,540
which used to take up hours of my day I

913
00:37:53,940 --> 00:38:00,180
understand why is social anxiety

914
00:37:56,540 --> 00:38:03,960
stuttering taking longer to heal okay so

915
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:06,359
first of all if your OCB is healed

916
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:09,780
extreme OCD

917
00:38:06,359 --> 00:38:12,180
that's incredible because OCD metal

918
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:15,119
deposits

919
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:17,400
we're stopping electrical impulses from

920
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:18,599
going through and they were bouncing I

921
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:20,220
talk about in the Brain book They're

922
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:23,220
bouncing off that metal deposit then

923
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:24,480
ricocheting up then ricocheting up

924
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:27,839
if you have other things you're working

925
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:30,380
on healing if you had severe OCD to

926
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:30,380
begin with

927
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:35,339
then

928
00:38:32,579 --> 00:38:37,380
there was a lot of metal there

929
00:38:35,339 --> 00:38:38,820
we we have to do a lot of work take the

930
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:41,520
books to your doctor ask your doctor

931
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:43,740
what's right for you

932
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:45,540
but when I talk to doctors about OCB I

933
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:47,280
notice that there are patients have a

934
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:49,079
tremendous amount of metal inside their

935
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,339
brains

936
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:53,099
and

937
00:38:50,339 --> 00:38:54,420
so severe OCD means there's more Metals

938
00:38:53,099 --> 00:38:55,740
inside the brain with so many doctors

939
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:57,000
I've talked to with their patients that

940
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:58,020
have helped with that I helped the

941
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,560
doctors figure out what's wrong with

942
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:00,560
their patients

943
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:08,760
if he says only after doing medical

944
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:10,740
medium protocols did I realize all

945
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:13,560
non-physical techniques like meditation

946
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:15,960
therapy counseling psychedelics Etc just

947
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:18,119
try to compensate for physical defects

948
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:22,579
in the body but don't heal they're just

949
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:22,579
Band-Aids they're just Band-Aids

950
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:27,480
I don't like the Psychedelic Band-Aid

951
00:39:25,859 --> 00:39:29,220
but meditation Band-Aids cool there's

952
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:31,020
there's that mean I'm totally I'm

953
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:32,280
totally into meditations Spirit of

954
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:35,400
compassion has given me so many

955
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:37,140
meditations to help to help um everybody

956
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:38,940
and they're in the books there's so many

957
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:42,180
meditations in these books now there's

958
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:45,119
medically there's meditations in Liver

959
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:47,099
Rescue there's meditations in medical

960
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:49,020
medium book one there's meditations in

961
00:39:47,099 --> 00:39:51,000
brain saver there's there

962
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:54,180
right and they're really powerful and

963
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:57,480
they help really shift and rewire but I

964
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:58,800
notice out there like psychedelics and I

965
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:00,839
always tell people go to your therapist

966
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,400
go to your accounts counselor go to your

967
00:40:00,839 --> 00:40:04,619
therapist go to your counselor do your

968
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:06,839
meditations but I never tell them do

969
00:40:04,619 --> 00:40:09,420
your psychedelics

970
00:40:06,839 --> 00:40:11,339
I'm always pro-counselors Pro therapy

971
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:12,720
whatever Pro meditation anybody wants to

972
00:40:11,339 --> 00:40:13,560
do any meditations out there in the

973
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:17,700
world

974
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:20,700
but I'm not pro psychedelics

975
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:23,460
I'm sorry but I'm not and I never will

976
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:27,000
be Pro psychedelic

977
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:30,420
I'm I'm pro- why someone is trying to

978
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:32,400
use a psychedelic because I feel for

979
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:33,900
them and I'm not judging them I know

980
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:36,660
they're using a psychedelic because

981
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:38,400
they're not well they're sick and no one

982
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:39,780
understands them and what's wrong so

983
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,640
they're trying a psychedelic because

984
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:44,460
they really don't know what else to do

985
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:46,500
so I'm Pro that person not judging them

986
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:49,859
or shaming them I'm not pro-sychedelic

987
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:52,320
use read the chapter on microdosing

988
00:40:49,859 --> 00:40:55,320
inside brain saver here the micro dosing

989
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:58,820
chapter it's insane I can't wait to read

990
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:58,820
it someday to you guys too

991
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:08,880
trying to hack or rewire our minds leads

992
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,980
us back to the same old patterns of

993
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:12,839
toxic heavy if toxic heavy metals are

994
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:14,520
still stuck in the brain and not leaving

995
00:41:12,839 --> 00:41:16,920
the brain

996
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:18,420
all right

997
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:22,160
I want to find another little spot to

998
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:22,160
read if you guys got a moment

999
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:25,339
if that's okay

1000
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:32,280
it's chronic anger disorder section

1001
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:34,020
I don't know if you guys want to do uh

1002
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:35,460
an intermission at all do you want to do

1003
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:37,260
a half time maybe break it up before

1004
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:39,920
we'll do that a little later all right

1005
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:39,920
let's keep on going

1006
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:46,940
chronic anger disorder on page 340 in

1007
00:41:44,099 --> 00:41:46,940
brain saver

1008
00:41:47,099 --> 00:41:53,579
if post-traumatic stress disorder

1009
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:56,220
has been ruled out

1010
00:41:53,579 --> 00:41:59,520
which is to say if it's been determined

1011
00:41:56,220 --> 00:42:02,099
that Trauma from past abuse or suffering

1012
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:03,900
is not the cause of someone's chronic

1013
00:42:02,099 --> 00:42:07,440
anger

1014
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:09,920
and rather it's unexplained chronic

1015
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:14,420
anger

1016
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:14,420
unexplained chronic anger

1017
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:22,859
then toxic heavy metals saturating

1018
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:25,680
emotional areas of the brain

1019
00:42:22,859 --> 00:42:29,060
and a stagnant sluggish liver are the

1020
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:29,060
underlying causes

1021
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:37,079
keep in mind

1022
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:39,920
you can also have a mix of all three

1023
00:42:37,079 --> 00:42:39,920
trauma

1024
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:45,119
metals

1025
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:47,400
and an overloaded overworked stagnant

1026
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:50,579
sluggish overburdened liver

1027
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:53,060
all terms from original medical medium

1028
00:42:50,579 --> 00:42:53,060
info

1029
00:42:53,099 --> 00:42:59,339
if I don't shout out for my self then

1030
00:42:57,060 --> 00:43:01,800
what am I going to do

1031
00:42:59,339 --> 00:43:04,319
if someone had a sluggish liver and went

1032
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:06,660
through mental abuse and toxic heavy

1033
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:08,940
metal exposure at roughly the same time

1034
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:10,560
The Chronic anger will often be

1035
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:13,319
expressed more aggressively and more

1036
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:15,900
frequently so many people have had toxic

1037
00:43:13,319 --> 00:43:18,859
heavy metal exposure during some trauma

1038
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:18,859
at the same moment

1039
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:25,380
I can tell you one area where that has

1040
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:27,300
happened recently with millions of

1041
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:30,240
people

1042
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:32,640
not just millions of people in this

1043
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:34,859
country of the United States but

1044
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:38,119
millions of people all around the world

1045
00:43:34,859 --> 00:43:38,119
in other countries

1046
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:43,680
there was a lot of trauma that occurred

1047
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,240
the last two and a half years a couple

1048
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:48,599
years whatever it's been now a little

1049
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:51,420
bit more and a lot of mercury entered a

1050
00:43:48,599 --> 00:43:53,400
lot of people's bodies at the same time

1051
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:57,859
they were emotionally

1052
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:57,859
trauma traumatized and tortured

1053
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:08,460
and it's heartbreaking

1054
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:10,440
I'm not just talking about 10 people I'm

1055
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:14,819
talking about Millions

1056
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:17,460
tens and tens and tens and millions

1057
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:20,240
were tortured emotionally recently and

1058
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:23,220
Mercury entered their bodies

1059
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:25,020
their brains

1060
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:26,819
someone had a sluggish liver and went

1061
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:29,819
through mental abuse of toxic heavy

1062
00:44:26,819 --> 00:44:31,619
metal exposure roughly the same time

1063
00:44:29,819 --> 00:44:34,260
that's what I'm talking about that's

1064
00:44:31,619 --> 00:44:36,119
just one example chronic anger will

1065
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:38,160
often be expressed more aggressively and

1066
00:44:36,119 --> 00:44:40,020
more frequently for example if someone

1067
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:41,040
went and got their Mercury Dental

1068
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:42,660
filling so it wasn't talking about

1069
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:44,940
Mercury Dental fillings but I'm just

1070
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:46,980
saying I'm talking about it now

1071
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:48,480
this is just I think one example if

1072
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:50,460
someone went and got their Mercury

1073
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:52,920
Dental fillings removed

1074
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:55,560
which destabilizes the metal and also

1075
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:57,480
got the worst news that day or week so

1076
00:44:55,560 --> 00:45:00,300
the day they had their Mercury amalgam

1077
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:01,740
removed they also was they also got a

1078
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:03,540
bunch of bad news

1079
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:06,119
keep this in mind how it works this is

1080
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:08,520
incredible information

1081
00:45:06,119 --> 00:45:10,920
simultaneously if someone had a Mercury

1082
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:13,079
filling removed at the same time they

1083
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:14,880
had a breakup in a relationship or some

1084
00:45:13,079 --> 00:45:18,140
other type of trauma or some kind of

1085
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:18,140
emotional hardship or stress

1086
00:45:18,839 --> 00:45:24,000
the emotional impact of

1087
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:25,619
of the difficult development plus the

1088
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,900
Mercury exposure can lead to more

1089
00:45:25,619 --> 00:45:29,579
symptoms of frustration and anger if the

1090
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:32,000
Mercury saturates the brain's emotional

1091
00:45:29,579 --> 00:45:32,000
centers

1092
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:35,660
it's really Advanced information

1093
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:39,839
go back and read the medical mean and

1094
00:45:37,859 --> 00:45:41,700
book series all the time people think I

1095
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:43,920
should know every single word that's

1096
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:47,180
been put in these eight volumes these

1097
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:47,180
eight volumes here in books

1098
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:50,819
but between hearing Spirit of compassion

1099
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:53,160
all the time in my ear giving me

1100
00:45:50,819 --> 00:45:56,099
additional information non-stop every

1101
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:57,900
day including what SSC already put in

1102
00:45:56,099 --> 00:45:59,640
all these books it's it's almost like an

1103
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:01,819
impossibility to just keep it all

1104
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:01,819
together

1105
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:10,079
see Vex lens on IG said yep therapy is a

1106
00:46:07,619 --> 00:46:14,339
coping mechanism to help you

1107
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:17,640
love with symptoms but it does not get

1108
00:46:14,339 --> 00:46:20,760
rid of symptoms since it does not

1109
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:23,819
address the cause

1110
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:26,819
that's really that's really so true

1111
00:46:23,819 --> 00:46:28,460
it's a really amazing comment

1112
00:46:26,819 --> 00:46:31,140
foreign

1113
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:33,180
saturating other areas of the brain can

1114
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:35,760
lead to other neurological symptoms such

1115
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:37,740
as fatigue

1116
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:39,300
nobody knew that

1117
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:41,040
mm info

1118
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:43,140
just saying

1119
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:46,200
most often chronic anger stems from

1120
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:50,000
toxic heavy metal exposures long ago in

1121
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:50,000
childhood happens a lot too

1122
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:54,720
here with Mariana says I healed an

1123
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:57,680
addiction

1124
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:57,680
that's incredible

1125
00:47:01,859 --> 00:47:07,020
so most often chronic anger stems from

1126
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:08,400
toxic heavy metal exposures long ago in

1127
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:11,520
childhood

1128
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:14,599
can you think of any

1129
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:18,480
toxic heavy metal exposures in childhood

1130
00:47:14,599 --> 00:47:21,839
oh I can think of plenty

1131
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:24,180
as someone gets older the metals age and

1132
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:27,079
oxidize causing chronic anger to worsen

1133
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:27,079
through later years

1134
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:32,160
anger can worsen as you get older

1135
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:35,160
because the metals are oxidizing that

1136
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:37,440
happens to so many people anger worsens

1137
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:39,119
as the years go on

1138
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:41,880
cold white spring says I could think of

1139
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:43,980
some kind as the years go on Tara

1140
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:46,740
Appleman mind-blowing information no one

1141
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:49,560
could come up with this if they tried I

1142
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:53,760
agree it can only be from above

1143
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:58,040
so complex but clear exactly and Tara I

1144
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:58,040
am not a smart guy

1145
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:02,640
there's a doctor like pretty recently

1146
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:04,440
called me a genius

1147
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:07,319
because he doesn't believe it comes from

1148
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:10,200
above so he thinks I'm a genius

1149
00:48:07,319 --> 00:48:12,359
I was like I don't know what to tell you

1150
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:13,619
but it came from above and it didn't

1151
00:48:12,359 --> 00:48:16,380
come from me

1152
00:48:13,619 --> 00:48:19,440
so now you have to be a genius like I'm

1153
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:21,720
not I'm not

1154
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:24,000
realist says that's why it's hard for

1155
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:25,800
all of us to start to change it's so

1156
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,500
much information I wish it was easier

1157
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:30,780
step one two three to heal thank you for

1158
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:33,480
everything I know but that's why I

1159
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:35,339
always say start where you can customize

1160
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:36,839
it start with celery juice just

1161
00:48:35,339 --> 00:48:39,000
customize it

1162
00:48:36,839 --> 00:48:40,680
start with something right I tell people

1163
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,180
start with a heavy metal detox smoothie

1164
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:45,780
start with celery you start with the 20

1165
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:47,280
day cleanse start with the 369

1166
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:50,160

the you know start with a 369 of any

1168
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:54,960
choice or start with the monocleanse or

1169
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:57,480
start with the morning cleanse maybe

1170
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:59,160
just the morning cleanse maybe look at

1171
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:00,900
the protocols for just your symptom or

1172
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:02,040
condition take the book to your doctor

the book all kinds of different things I

1176
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:10,520
know I tell people a lot of different

1177
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:10,520
stuff

1178
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:16,319
when people aren't feeling well

1179
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:18,839
physically it can be angering

1180
00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:20,160
I mean come on you guys know that come

1181
00:49:18,839 --> 00:49:22,920
on

1182
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:26,760
MD on YouTube you just have to stay

1183
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:29,400
steeped in this info and really study it

1184
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:30,540
gets me emotional because that's what I

1185
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:33,300
have to do

1186
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:35,579
like in my own personal experience I

1187
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:38,940
have to stay steeped in it

1188
00:49:35,579 --> 00:49:41,160
you know because it's a lot of info

1189
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:43,020
every time Spirit of compassion says we

1190
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:45,540
have to do another book

1191
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:47,940
we have to get these Bibles out there

1192
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:50,760
for people so that they're here 30 years

1193
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:53,339
from now 40 years from now

1194
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:54,420
50 years from now that these books are

1195
00:49:53,339 --> 00:49:56,099
here

1196
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:58,619
Spirit of compassion is always thinking

1197
00:49:56,099 --> 00:50:00,420
about me being gone someday

1198
00:49:58,619 --> 00:50:03,680
and always like well we have to have

1199
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:03,680
these Bibles here

1200
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:07,319
in hopes that even when they're book

1201
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:11,099
burning down the road

1202
00:50:07,319 --> 00:50:14,339
that these somehow survive

1203
00:50:11,099 --> 00:50:17,460

1234
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:44,400
shifter

1235
00:51:42,059 --> 00:51:47,040
so I could be yep the books need to be

1236
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:48,660
re-read over and over I'm rereading all

1237
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:51,660
of them and I amazed at how much I

1238
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:54,599
forgot muck till Freedom says

1239
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:56,339
anger is not always bad

1240
00:51:54,599 --> 00:52:00,540
depend

1241
00:51:56,339 --> 00:52:02,940
there is look there is obviously

1242
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:06,359
a healthy reason

1243
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:09,540
right to get upset I'm not saying it's

1244
00:52:06,359 --> 00:52:13,500
it's it's bad to be like angry or upset

1245
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:18,020
that's not it I'm saying though that we

1246
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:18,020
can't stay in a perpetually angry place

1247
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:25,440
if we have a spark of anger inside of us

1248
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:28,140
because we feel we're not justified or

1249
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:30,300
in Injustice Justice occurred it's a

1250
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:32,579
natural experience and emotion

1251
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:34,200
but what's not natural to us is the

1252
00:52:32,579 --> 00:52:38,119
metal inside our brains that gets

1253
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:38,119
affected from when we have that anger

1254
00:52:41,099 --> 00:52:45,119
and that's the part I'm trying to help

1255
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:47,579
people with because we got to take care

1256
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:49,559
of ourselves

1257
00:52:47,579 --> 00:52:51,119
anger can spur

1258
00:52:49,559 --> 00:52:53,880
action

1259
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:57,180
there is a healthy level of it and I

1260
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:59,460
know that like I'm pissed off I want to

1261
00:52:57,180 --> 00:53:02,819
do something about that

1262
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:04,920
but we're talking about when it feels

1263
00:53:02,819 --> 00:53:07,920
like it's past that

1264
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:11,040
and if anybody wants a healthy small

1265
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:13,440
bout of anger to propel an action to

1266
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:16,260
justify something let's get the metals

1267
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:19,020
out of your brain so they're not melting

1268
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:21,240
during that process many get stuck in

1269
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:22,859
constant chronic anger and that's a

1270
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:24,480
whole nother thing

1271
00:53:22,859 --> 00:53:27,900
when people aren't feeling well

1272
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:29,700
physically it can be angry is that true

1273
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:33,020
is that true if you don't feel good

1274
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:33,020
physically can it be anchoring

1275
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:38,940
because there's a physical reason not

1276
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:40,559
just because we want to be angry there's

1277
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:43,859
a physical reason why we get spurred on

1278
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:46,680
into mystery chronic anger all the time

1279
00:53:43,859 --> 00:53:48,660
if you're chronically sick plus you're

1280
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:50,640
also experiencing any of these factors

1281
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:52,319
trauma heavy metals or an overloaded

1282
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:54,599
liver

1283
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:56,160
the feeling of that chronic unwellness

1284
00:53:54,599 --> 00:53:57,780
can act as a trigger for these

1285
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:59,520
underlying cause of chronic anger if

1286
00:53:57,780 --> 00:54:01,380
you're not feeling good and you got

1287
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:04,500
Metals in your brain man you could be

1288
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:07,440
stuck with chronic anger happening in

1289
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:08,760
your life many get blamed for it not

1290
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:10,559
managing their motions that's what

1291
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:12,839
they're blamed for you're not managing

1292
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:14,760
your emotions

1293
00:54:12,839 --> 00:54:16,619
you're angry because you're not managing

1294
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:19,319
your emotions you're crappy at managing

1295
00:54:16,619 --> 00:54:21,300
your emotions and it's sad because dude

1296
00:54:19,319 --> 00:54:22,920
you don't know what's inside their head

1297
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:24,420
you don't know how much metal is inside

1298
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:26,880
their head and how much trauma they've

1299
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:29,220
had and everything else

1300
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:31,079
don't be punishing people because they

1301
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:32,579
can't manage their emotions don't tell

1302
00:54:31,079 --> 00:54:34,680
them that they're not good at managing

1303
00:54:32,579 --> 00:54:36,480
it

1304
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:39,119
you think they want to be angry you

1305
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:41,339
think people want to be angry

1306
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:43,740
you don't pun you can't punish people

1307
00:54:41,339 --> 00:54:45,119
for being angry I get it that we want we

1308
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:46,680
want to punish people for being angry

1309
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:48,480
shouldn't be angry but the point is is

1310
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:50,700
what if they're really suffering they

1311
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:52,200
really don't feel good physically what

1312
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:53,880
if they're that one person that gets

1313
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:56,040
blamed for not managing their emotions

1314
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:59,160
right when it's not their fault they got

1315
00:54:56,040 --> 00:55:02,460
they literally have all this this

1316
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:05,460
trauma and medals and

1317
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:07,980
their brain needs help

1318
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:09,660
physically no one knows that their

1319
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:12,780
electrolytes are down their metals are

1320
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:15,319
actually causing problems nobody knows

1321
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:15,319
foreign

1322
00:55:18,859 --> 00:55:24,000
problem that hasn't been addressed

1323
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:25,140
they can't

1324
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,579
think

1325
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:29,099
yourself

1326
00:55:26,579 --> 00:55:31,559
out of that

1327
00:55:29,099 --> 00:55:33,059
it's hard to think yourself out of that

1328
00:55:31,559 --> 00:55:34,859
if you have a physical problem that's

1329
00:55:33,059 --> 00:55:38,579
not being addressed you can't just wheel

1330
00:55:34,859 --> 00:55:40,319
yourself out of that so easy I'm gonna

1331
00:55:38,579 --> 00:55:42,980
I'm gonna try to think myself out of

1332
00:55:40,319 --> 00:55:42,980
this so fast

1333
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:47,220
so we're doing the anchor shifter

1334
00:55:45,359 --> 00:55:48,680
because that

1335
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:51,059
has

1336
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:52,859
phytochemical compounds synergistically

1337
00:55:51,059 --> 00:55:54,119
working together to hit the emotional

1338
00:55:52,859 --> 00:55:55,740
centers of the brain to help somebody

1339
00:55:54,119 --> 00:55:57,780
get relief while they're fixing other

1340
00:55:55,740 --> 00:55:59,880
problems

1341
00:55:57,780 --> 00:56:02,339
homely said all the anger management

1342
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:04,319
classes not based on real knowledge

1343
00:56:02,339 --> 00:56:06,119
exactly it's not like you go into your

1344
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:09,740
anger management class and they're like

1345
00:56:06,119 --> 00:56:09,740
well Mr Ferguson

1346
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:13,740
I know you're really angry because

1347
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:16,859
you've been on the toilet constipated

1348
00:56:13,740 --> 00:56:19,440
every day you can't go to bathroom Mrs

1349
00:56:16,859 --> 00:56:21,780
Ferguson made you come in because you're

1350
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:24,119
angry every day

1351
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:26,520
so we're going to try to rethink

1352
00:56:24,119 --> 00:56:28,559
you out of this

1353
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:30,480
Mr Ferguson's like I can't go to

1354
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:33,720
bathroom that's why I'm angry I'm on the

1355
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:36,900
toilet for four hours a day trying to

1356
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:39,480
push out of bowel movement

1357
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:41,400
that's why I'm frustrated and angry well

1358
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:44,059
we can rethink this differently Mr

1359
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:44,059
Ferguson

1360
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:56,940

all right so what's the ingredients in

1417
00:59:29,819 --> 00:59:35,220
the anchor shifter do you guys know

1418
00:59:31,859 --> 00:59:37,380
it's a half cup of tightly packed fresh

1419
00:59:35,220 --> 00:59:39,859
mint

1420
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:39,859
right

1421
00:59:40,799 --> 00:59:47,660
but before we get started right

1422
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:47,660
let's read about the shot

1423
00:59:47,940 --> 00:59:54,079
that's really important and I actually

1424
00:59:50,339 --> 00:59:54,079
forgot to read about it all right

1425
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:59,819
okay you guys ready

1426
00:59:56,720 --> 01:00:02,579
use the anger shifter

1427
00:59:59,819 --> 01:00:04,680
if you have unexplained bouts of anger

1428
01:00:02,579 --> 01:00:07,920
or anger surges that seem to arise

1429
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:09,960
without cause any of you have that I

1430
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:11,940
just want to ask that question

1431
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:13,260
do you guys have that happen at all I'm

1432
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:15,920
just curious

1433
01:00:13,260 --> 01:00:18,420
right yes mint is easy to grow

1434
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:21,680
unexplained bouts of anger or anger

1435
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:24,000
surges that seem to arise without cause

1436
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:25,380
is that happening

1437
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:27,180
because I know a lot of people go

1438
01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:31,380
through that that I've seen out there

1439
01:00:27,180 --> 01:00:34,200
okay use this shot if anger surges

1440
01:00:31,380 --> 01:00:36,720
have a cause if you have an anger surge

1441
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:39,180
that actually has a cause use the shot

1442
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:40,859
then too totally to totally use a shot

1443
01:00:39,180 --> 01:00:41,520
if you have an anger surge that has a

1444
01:00:40,859 --> 01:00:43,859
Cause

1445
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:45,660
you can use a shot if you have anger

1446
01:00:43,859 --> 01:00:47,819
surges that don't seem to have a cause

1447
01:00:45,660 --> 01:00:49,799

betrayal

1489
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:34,619
so if you're somebody that

1490
01:02:32,579 --> 01:02:36,119
you know

1491
01:02:34,619 --> 01:02:38,460
you're being triggered because of

1492
01:02:36,119 --> 01:02:40,859
something disappointment and betrayal

1493
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:42,359
you're being wronged in some way and

1494
01:02:40,859 --> 01:02:44,940
that's what's happening then you can use

1495
01:02:42,359 --> 01:02:47,220
the anger shifter

1496
01:02:44,940 --> 01:02:48,839
here's one right here

1497
01:02:47,220 --> 01:02:53,339
use the anger shifter if you have

1498
01:02:48,839 --> 01:02:55,079
confrontations or disputes with others

1499
01:02:53,339 --> 01:02:56,280
if you ever have a confrontation or

1500
01:02:55,079 --> 01:02:57,540
maybe you're on the phone with the phone

1501
01:02:56,280 --> 01:03:00,660
company

1502
01:02:57,540 --> 01:03:02,760
and you wait it for an hour

1503
01:03:00,660 --> 01:03:03,480
and then all of a sudden they hung up on

1504
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:05,579
you

1505
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:08,220
before anybody even started talking to

1506
01:03:05,579 --> 01:03:10,200
you or you were on the phone with the

1507
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:12,359
phone company for an hour and a half

1508
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:15,420
trying to fix a problem

1509
01:03:12,359 --> 01:03:18,119
and they finally started helping you

1510
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:19,559
and in the middle of it it hung up on

1511
01:03:18,119 --> 01:03:22,880
you

1512
01:03:19,559 --> 01:03:22,880
and they didn't call you back

1513
01:03:24,119 --> 01:03:29,400
use the anchor shifter

1514
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:31,319
if you're angry about world events so if

1515
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:32,880

like

1524
01:03:46,619 --> 01:03:52,680

of the Dark Ages right and they'll just

1540
01:04:31,140 --> 01:04:35,280
cut your tongue off

1541
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:38,540
cauterize it with

1542
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:38,540
a hot poker

1543
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:41,240
foreign

1544
01:04:41,599 --> 01:04:47,520

1557
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:20,700
saturated into the leaders of the world

1558
01:05:18,059 --> 01:05:23,180

1565
01:05:40,559 --> 01:05:47,579
if your anger is towards yourself

1566
01:05:44,099 --> 01:05:50,160

1569
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:56,940
which

1570
01:05:53,579 --> 01:05:59,760

01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:03,540
and the anger shifter is definitely

1573
01:06:01,559 --> 01:06:05,819
satisfying there's two books right here

1574
01:06:03,540 --> 01:06:08,760
you're gonna want both of them they're

1575
01:06:05,819 --> 01:06:12,180
both critical it was one book how to be

1576
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:14,040
put into two big Bibles

1577
01:06:12,180 --> 01:06:15,359
people are asking about the books right

1578
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:17,220
now that's why I'm mentioning it they're

1579
01:06:15,359 --> 01:06:19,680
saying which book do I get well there's

1580
01:06:17,220 --> 01:06:21,480
two brain saver books one protocols and

1581
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:23,460
one brain saver you need them both it's

1582
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:26,940

1583
01:06:23,460 --> 01:06:28,980
chance if you're in the U.S oh my God

1584
01:06:26,940 --> 01:06:31,079
these two right here are literally

1585
01:06:28,980 --> 01:06:33,420
almost 50 off I think one already is

1586
01:06:31,079 --> 01:06:35,880
it's 22 the other one's like 28 or

1587
01:06:33,420 --> 01:06:37,260
something but incredible the pricing's

1588
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:40,319
insane

1589
01:06:37,260 --> 01:06:42,119
over 600 pages each I promise you this

1590
01:06:40,319 --> 01:06:47,400
when you start reading the brain saver

1591
01:06:42,119 --> 01:06:49,260
books you can't go back to the

1592
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:51,420
I can promise you this once you start

1593
01:06:49,260 --> 01:06:53,280
cracking into these brain saver books

1594
01:06:51,420 --> 01:06:55,200
you will not be when you read the other

1595
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:56,880

what when you read these mark my words

1598
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:04,079
when you get into these two books you'll

1599
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:06,000
just be like and then you go back to one

1600
01:07:04,079 --> 01:07:07,140
of the other health books you're just

1601
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:09,000

anybody who's using weed I realized that

1633
01:08:28,980 --> 01:08:33,480
most people using weed are really just

1634
01:08:31,859 --> 01:08:35,460
hurting bad

1635
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:37,259
emotionally and physically they have

1636
01:08:35,460 --> 01:08:39,359
real physical problems wrong with their

1637
01:08:37,259 --> 01:08:42,120
brain and they're using the weed to

1638
01:08:39,359 --> 01:08:44,900
medicate and I'm not making fun of them

1639
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:44,900

1644
01:08:57,480 --> 01:09:02,660
out of his mind

1645
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:02,660
and he sits on his couch

1646
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:06,319
his wife left him

1647
01:09:08,339 --> 01:09:12,779

1648
01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:14,640

1653
01:09:26,219 --> 01:09:29,520
even though you know how I come on here

1654
01:09:28,020 --> 01:09:31,380
as rice right

1655
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:33,540
but it's a real story though I do have a

1656
01:09:31,380 --> 01:09:35,580
friend and

1657
01:09:33,540 --> 01:09:37,259
he didn't do anything but smoked weed on

1658
01:09:35,580 --> 01:09:40,679
the couch

1659
01:09:37,259 --> 01:09:43,020
and his wife just walked in one day

1660
01:09:40,679 --> 01:09:45,779
the pizza boxes were everywhere and his

1661
01:09:43,020 --> 01:09:48,799
wife walked in and said

1662
01:09:45,779 --> 01:09:48,799

01:10:07,380 --> 01:10:11,060
it happened and I told him

1668
01:10:11,100 --> 01:10:17,120
there's only so many years when you're

1669
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:20,040

that you can just smoke weed every day

1671
01:10:20,040 --> 01:10:24,960
and every night or every night where

1672
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:27,179
chances are

1673
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:28,679
your girlfriend or your wife is just

1674
01:10:27,179 --> 01:10:30,659
going to be like I can't take this

1675
01:10:28,679 --> 01:10:32,340
anymore

1676
01:10:30,659 --> 01:10:34,440
this is going to be really strong this

1677
01:10:32,340 --> 01:10:35,760
anger shifter man it's just gonna be

1678
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:37,739
strong

1679
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:39,900
I'm actually scared on how strong this

1680
01:10:37,739 --> 01:10:41,580
is going to be maybe that's a good thing

1681
01:10:39,900 --> 01:10:44,300
I'm actually spooked this thing's gonna

1682
01:10:41,580 --> 01:10:44,300
be Wicked

1683
01:10:46,380 --> 01:10:51,060
that's a lot of sage I put in there but

1684
01:10:49,020 --> 01:10:52,380
it's tightly packed and it's it's from

1685
01:10:51,060 --> 01:10:53,760
it's going to be tightly packed because

1686
01:10:52,380 --> 01:10:55,739
I kind of measured into what I'm going

1687
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:58,980
to do that's not usually up to you so

1688
01:10:55,739 --> 01:11:02,060
much I know half cup of fresh or thawed

1689
01:10:58,980 --> 01:11:02,060
frozen mango

1690
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:07,920
all right

1691
01:11:05,159 --> 01:11:09,840
it's common on IG right now is the Omega

1692
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:12,360
Juicer from Amazon

1693
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:13,560
the same as the one from Omega go to the

1694
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:16,440
Omega company

1695
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:18,000
okay because it's not on sale on Amazon

1696
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:19,739
I got to shut this down because I'm

1697
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:21,480
worried someone's gonna get the juicer

1698
01:11:19,739 --> 01:11:24,360
and it's not gonna be on sale the mm

1699
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:26,520
1500 and the mm900 are on sale at Omega

1700
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:27,900
juicers.com the link is in the

1701
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:30,600
description the link is in the profile

1702
01:11:27,900 --> 01:11:32,159
see mm 1500 is what I'm using it's an

1703
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:33,840
incredible juicer it's cold pressed

1704
01:11:32,159 --> 01:11:37,440
masticating juicer that actually

1705
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:39,300
squeezes more juice out of the produce

1706
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:41,219
so you save money and if you're juicing

1707
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:43,980
celery every day and you're juicing

1708
01:11:41,219 --> 01:11:45,900
celery and greens and all that your pulp

1709
01:11:43,980 --> 01:11:48,300
comes out dry

1710
01:11:45,900 --> 01:11:51,000
and you're saving all this money it's

1711
01:11:48,300 --> 01:11:52,260
really really incredible right so it

1712
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:55,140
pays for itself there's people that

1713
01:11:52,260 --> 01:11:57,480
claim they're saving 80 a week 100 a

1714
01:11:55,140 --> 01:11:58,800
week on produce fifty dollars a week on

1715
01:11:57,480 --> 01:12:01,560
produce eighty dollars a month on

1716
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:03,480
produce it's incredible

1717
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:05,219
um look what it got out of these herbs

1718
01:12:03,480 --> 01:12:08,880
okay I'm just gonna show you do you guys

1719
01:12:05,219 --> 01:12:12,060
okay this is really critical to know

1720
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:15,239
I Juiced some mint

1721
01:12:12,060 --> 01:12:20,060
I Juiced some Sage

1722
01:12:15,239 --> 01:12:20,060
I didn't even juice the stems okay

1723
01:12:20,580 --> 01:12:26,820
okay that's super dry right there

1724
01:12:24,239 --> 01:12:30,600
the pulp

1725
01:12:26,820 --> 01:12:32,280
and look how much juice I got out of two

1726
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:35,280
herbs

1727
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:39,480
you can't get juice out of herbs

1728
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:42,179
it's so hard you need more and more with

1729
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:43,620
other juicers this is incredible what

1730
01:12:42,179 --> 01:12:47,640
this does

1731
01:12:43,620 --> 01:12:50,420
the warranty is 15 years including Parts

1732
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:53,280
15 years

1733
01:12:50,420 --> 01:12:55,860
it's insane

1734
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:57,179
anyway you can't buy it on Amazon you

1735
01:12:55,860 --> 01:12:59,880
buy it on Amazon you don't get the

1736
01:12:57,179 --> 01:13:02,040
discount it's on sale right now

1737
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:05,040
just saying all right let's go let's get

1738
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:07,440
moving let's do the Frozen mango next

1739
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:09,540
that's why I endorse these juicers and

1740
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:11,100
work with these guys because of the food

1741
01:13:09,540 --> 01:13:13,739
prices going up

1742
01:13:11,100 --> 01:13:17,760
I predicted the food prices were going

1743
01:13:13,739 --> 01:13:19,440
up I predicted it years ago before they

1744
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:21,480
went up

1745
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:24,060
and so

1746
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:27,300
what was incredible about this juicer

1747
01:13:24,060 --> 01:13:30,719
was that very thing because it it helped

1748
01:13:27,300 --> 01:13:34,640
remedy it helped to do something to the

1749
01:13:30,719 --> 01:13:34,640
food pricing that was going up okay

1750
01:13:34,860 --> 01:13:38,760
so it's really incredible

1751
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:41,179
all right so I think I need some carrot

1752
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:41,179
decks

1753
01:13:41,219 --> 01:13:46,320
so

1754
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:47,640
now the blueberry juice

1755
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:49,080
I'm gonna put some blueberries you can

1756
01:13:47,640 --> 01:13:50,699
do the wild blueberries the Frozen wild

1757
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:52,739
blueberries right the Wyman's Frozen

1758
01:13:50,699 --> 01:13:55,880
wild blueberries I'm just going to add

1759
01:13:52,739 --> 01:13:55,880
some blueberry juice in here

1760
01:13:56,340 --> 01:14:02,480
fit exact amount

1761
01:13:58,860 --> 01:14:02,480
I've got a little touch of that in there

1762
01:14:02,580 --> 01:14:05,520
so I didn't put the Frozen wild

1763
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:07,860
blueberries in this time I'm just using

1764
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:11,239
the juice in there because you can

1765
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:11,239
it says it in the book

1766
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:16,020
so now I'm going to look at this carrot

1767
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:21,920
here

1768
01:14:16,020 --> 01:14:21,920
and it says one cup of chopped carrots

1769
01:14:22,199 --> 01:14:25,880

1770
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:42,120

the public

1777
01:14:53,340 --> 01:14:57,179

happening

1781
01:15:00,780 --> 01:15:05,580
this is a free challenge I won't close

1782
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:07,920

1783
01:15:05,580 --> 01:15:09,719

it's free

1785
01:15:09,719 --> 01:15:13,620
I don't want to charge for that charge

1786
01:15:11,580 --> 01:15:15,960
for programs subscription fees on the

1787
01:15:13,620 --> 01:15:17,760
website I don't do any of that

1788
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:20,219
much

1789
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:22,440
no commercials in front of my podcast no

1790
01:15:20,219 --> 01:15:25,440
advertising in front of my podcast

1791
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:27,120
so I'm doing uh some carrots

1792
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:29,239
cup of carrots gonna do a little bit

1793
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:29,239
more

1794
01:15:33,900 --> 01:15:38,280
some more carrot

1795
01:15:36,659 --> 01:15:40,699
are you guys doing it with me or just

1796
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:40,699
watching

1797
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:49,020
let's see I used to be Bryce so grateful

1798
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:52,080
for the medical medium info that healed

1799
01:15:49,020 --> 01:15:54,659
and I can be a free person for my family

1800
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:57,900
and for myself incredible incredible

1801
01:15:54,659 --> 01:15:57,900
America amazing

1802
01:15:59,219 --> 01:16:02,239
all right we're good

1803
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:06,239
now what you want to do because of the

1804
01:16:04,260 --> 01:16:08,040
high compression in here that sometimes

1805
01:16:06,239 --> 01:16:09,600
when you use something like mango it's a

1806
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:12,000
little softer it takes time to go down

1807
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:13,679
you can spend a little time have a

1808
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:16,340
little patience and it'll go down and

1809
01:16:13,679 --> 01:16:16,340
you can push it down

1810
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:21,179
but that high compression makes it so

1811
01:16:19,199 --> 01:16:22,260
when you do juicing when you're juicing

1812
01:16:21,179 --> 01:16:24,480
juicing

1813
01:16:22,260 --> 01:16:26,580
man the amount of money you save is just

1814
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:28,080
incredible

1815
01:16:26,580 --> 01:16:31,380
and you can't say that with other

1816
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:33,659
juicers amazing what you'll find is the

1817
01:16:31,380 --> 01:16:35,480
pulp doesn't come out sloppy wet where

1818
01:16:33,659 --> 01:16:37,980
all your money's thrown out the window

1819
01:16:35,480 --> 01:16:40,440
it's thrown out the window with a lot of

1820
01:16:37,980 --> 01:16:42,120
juicers because the pulp is sloppy wet

1821
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:43,739
as it's coming out that's all your juice

1822
01:16:42,120 --> 01:16:44,940
so you have to put a lot more in you

1823
01:16:43,739 --> 01:16:46,860
don't have to do that with the medical

1824
01:16:44,940 --> 01:16:50,940
medium

1825
01:16:46,860 --> 01:16:54,239
um the mm-1500 and 900 that pulp is dry

1826
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:57,199
like dust dry nothing wet in there it's

1827
01:16:54,239 --> 01:16:57,199
on sale you guys

1828
01:16:57,780 --> 01:17:02,520
all right so we got a juice right here I

1829
01:17:00,179 --> 01:17:05,960
got a lot more than I bargained for in

1830
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:05,960
that one though I have to say

1831
01:17:06,900 --> 01:17:10,280
