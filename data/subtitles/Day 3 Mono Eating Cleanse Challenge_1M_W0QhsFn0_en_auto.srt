00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:40,160
and heal the mono cleanse

191
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,039
helps to realign cranial nerves think

192
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,960
about that

193
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,080
you know how powerful that is we blow

194
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,560
out our cranial nerves

195
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,199
with over senses over sensing over

196
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,039
sensitivity

197
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,800
eating this and that all this flavor

198
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,560
boom boom boom boom boom

199
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,720
and we blow out some of our cranial

200
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,080
nerves we blow it out with caffeine

201
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,199
we're blowing out our cranial nerves

202
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,400
that way

203
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:02,560
and we're realigning cranial nerves

204
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,160
that control all the different senses

205
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,960
right and the taste buds and everything

206
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,440
so

207
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:10,160
really this is really in a great

208
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,759
opportunity a great opportunity to do

209
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:15,280
some good healing

210
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:17,840
and to move your body forward okay and

211
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:21,759
the mono cleanse is a wonderful thing

212
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,759
because you're removing

213
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:30,080
you're removing poison but still eating

214
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:32,560
removing poison and still eating you're

215
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:35,279
getting rid of insulin resistance

216
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,000
and still eating everybody doesn't know

217
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:39,039
it

218
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:43,039
but their insulin resistant jacked

219
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:46,160
up bad they're like insulin resistance

220
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:47,360
everybody walking around is an insulin

221
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,600
resistance

222
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,399
okay you go into a place where there's a

223
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,720
crowd of people

224
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,000
just everybody's boinked out with

225
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,160
insulin resistance

226
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,800
everybody's got the insulin resistance

227
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:01,440
their pancreas is on overload

228
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,720
pushing out insulin left and right

229
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,519
because they have so much

230
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,279
fat inside their blood you can't get

231
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,440
sugar in your cells

232
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:10,320
sugar that you need in your cells

233
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,839
because you die

234
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,360
without the sugar did you know that you

235
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,399
can't live without glucose did you guys

236
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,680
know that

237
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:20,399
you know that you know what's funny

238
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,040
i talked to somebody the other day right

239
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,040
okay

240
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,240
old friend who's a doctor right have

241
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,680
been talked to in

242
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:31,200
25 years and they're like aw

243
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:34,800
i got a patient who is doing this

244
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:37,040
this this carnivore diet thing

245
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,160
and i'm like and they're and they're

246
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,839
saying and

247
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,320
i said what's in the diet tell me what's

248
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:46,560
in the diet this is really important

249
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:50,000
what's in the diet is um all the meat

250
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:54,320
of course and then what's interesting

251
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:57,600
what's in the diet is also like honey

252
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:59,040
they put honey in the carnivore diet now

253
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:05,200
they're putting honey in there

254
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:08,240
guess why because you go

255
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,760
that's why there's honey in the keto

256
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,279
diets now

257
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,120
there wasn't hot honey wasn't in the

258
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:16,320
keto diet did you know that you guys

259
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,680
honey wasn't in the keto diet okay honey

260
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,959
honey wasn't in there

261
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:22,880
nor were some berries nor were some uh

262
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:24,480
avocado wasn't even in there right

263
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,399
nuts and seeds weren't in the keto diet

264
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,959
but they're putting all the sugar in

265
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:31,040
nuts and seeds have sugar in it not just

266
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:32,800
fat but there's a little sugar in it

267
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,079
avocado's not just fat there's a little

268
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,560
sugar in it right

269
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,200
they're putting all the stuff in there

270
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,399
because you

271
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:42,480
can't you can't live on a keto diet

272
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,240
a real keto diet where you go into

273
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,160
ketosis you'll die

274
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,160
yeah you don't believe me people have

275
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,640
died who adhered to it to the

276
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,360
tooth and nail the people who didn't die

277
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,120
binged

278
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,040
on carbs and then went back on their

279
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,480
keto diet for a week and then binged on

280
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,079
carbs then went on a keto diet for a

281
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,600
week and binge on carbs they had to

282
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,360
binge on carbs back

283
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,640
20 years ago the reason why they had to

284
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,320
binge on carbs because if they didn't

285
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,320
get sugar they would actually lose their

286
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,079
mind and just start going down hole in a

287
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,959
rabbit hole right

288
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:11,920
and so keto diet changed it's not just

289
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:15,279
meat

290
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:16,399
and a non-starchy vegetable or just meat

291
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:18,240
alone it now

292
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,240
changed into put all the sugar in it but

293
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,240
keep it the keto name how stupid is that

294
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:25,200
because you can't go into ketosis

295
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,160
the point is is that your brain runs on

296
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,480
glucose

297
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,880
but everybody's got the insulin

298
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,560
resistance everybody in keto diet land

299
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,240
has insulin resistance i'm sorry they

300
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,279
all have insulin resistance even if it's

301
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,440
not measurable

302
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,399
to a degree yet because your a1c isn't

303
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,000
jacked up yet

304
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:41,519
they still got the insulin resistance we

305
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,079
walk around with all this insulin

306
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,160
resistance

307
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,360
that's what we do you guys if you're

308
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,959
doing the mono cleanse

309
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,360
you just got rid of insulin resistance

310
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:51,760
bomb gone boom gone

311
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,880
gone that's what happens you lose your

312
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,000
insulin resistance

313
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,680
and when you lose your insulin

314
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,639
resistance your body has a chance to

315
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,240
heal

316
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,639
and when you get the fat out of your

317
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,880
blood for a few days your body starts to

318
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,639
heal you start to cleanse

319
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,240
that's what happens health is good to

320
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,600
see it

321
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,519
you know you start to cleanse on tick

322
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,760
tock when you get rid of those

323
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:12,880
fats for a little bit you start to

324
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,959
cleanse

325
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,880
because you're not even battling insulin

326
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:18,720
resistance anymore

327
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,639
here's what we do here's what we do on

328
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,519
planet earth we kill our pancreases

329
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,279
that's what we do

330
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:25,440
we're taught even with healthy

331
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,920
professional healthy diet people out

332
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,079
there

333
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,200
we're taught to destroy our pancreases

334
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:31,519
kill our livers

335
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,040
we just do it slower because you get off

336
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,480
of processed foods you get off of fast

337
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,760
foods you get off a junk food so you're

338
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,959
slowing down your kill

339
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:40,880
process that's what's happening

340
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:42,320
and then you're working out you're

341
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,000
working out to counter

342
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,680
the junk you're eating or you're working

343
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,959
out to counter the healthy foods you're

344
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,639
eating that still

345
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:50,720
fill the fat that's giving you insulin

346
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,040
resistance foods that are still killing

347
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,040
you

348
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,800
diets that are still killing you you're

349
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,800
you're working those diets off

350
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,399
you're doing your exercising right

351
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:01,440
you're keeping that death

352
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:04,160
death level slower

353
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,440
but what happens you guys is in the end

354
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,720
you're still battling all the fat

355
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,760
because everybody's trying to fat

356
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,680

376
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:49,279
so real and it's kind of heartbreaking

377
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,120
i do it in a joking way but it's hard to

378
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,320
do because it's heartbreaking

379
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,639
because you got a whole bunch of people

380
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,399
out there losing things losing their

381
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:58,720
pancreases over time

382
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,320
getting diabetes a1c starts going up

383
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,760
there they're getting chronic illness

384
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,720
things are going wrong

385
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:06,240
losing their kidneys losing their hearts

386
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,199
getting strokes and heart attacks down

387
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,800
the road because they're fatting

388
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:10,320
themselves of death so when i do that

389
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,440
robot on that i'm like thinking about it

390
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,320
well it's sad

391
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:17,360
here's the thing right so the bottom

392
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:19,680
line is okay is that

393
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:22,000
when you're doing the amount of cleanse

394
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,839

439
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:10,240
start getting better

440
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:11,759
and that's a key the only i got to tell

441

you

442
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:16,079
to that last comment about smelling

443
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:20,000
fresh air

444
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:22,680
we're at a place right now in the world

445
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,040
where the chemical companies have

446
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:28,240
brainwashed

447
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:31,279
most of the human beings on this planet

448
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:35,279
to spray and use their chemicals

449
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:38,720
daily perfumes cologne scented candles

450
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:41,199
air fresheners aftershaves

451
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,160
scented products detergents and fabric

452
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:44,880
softeners

453
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:46,639
have dangerous chemicals fill the

454
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,399
dangerous chemicals from dangerous

455
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:51,199
chemical factories

456
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:53,199
and they have taken over you can't go to

457
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,880
a beach without smelling everybody's

458
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:57,279
crap coming off of them

459
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:59,920
there is no smelling fresh air you got

460
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:00,240
to find a place nobody's around to smell

461
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,920
it

462
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,160
and you're lucky if it's not blowing out

463
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,199
of somebody's dryer somewhere it's we're

464
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:09,120
at a point

465
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:13,120
now where they're they're trying to take

466
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:15,439
out people by by doing the chemical

467
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:17,919
thing to such a degree they found a way

468
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:19,839
to make sure all the products have it

469
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:21,919
they found a way to kill the environment

470
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:23,839
through this process of fragrances

471
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:25,760
no one's talking about it as the only

472
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:27,280
one talking about it for years

473
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,720
still pretty much the only one talking

474
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,240
about unless someone's you know heard

475
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,000
the medical medium podcast at apple

476
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,880
podcast on fragrances

477
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,039
but we're we're at a place now where

478
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,679
clothes that are that you want to order

479
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:39,679
and buy

480
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:41,520
or something you go into a store there's

481
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:43,679
it's everything saturated with air

482
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:45,679
fresheners and scented candles

483
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,360
everybody's got it all over them when

484
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:48,160
they they eat everybody who thinks

485
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,160
they're healthy

486
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,679
too it's like oh i'm so into the

487
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:55,280
environment

488
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:57,679
i'm so into like you know sustainability

489
00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:00,240
and environment and health food and

490
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:01,760
i'm into this and that and oh i'm just

491
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,400
gonna write my camp light my

492
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,039
scented candles with my friends and i'm

493
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,840
just gonna

494
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:09,440
do my air fresheners and spray more

495
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,280
perfume all over me and

496
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,440
not that the perfume ever went anywhere

497
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,559
that you sprayed a month ago it doesn't

498
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,039
go anywhere

499
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:18,720
you spray perfume on you a month ago

500
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:21,360
it's on you the same

501
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,960
it's on you the same it's like you smell

502
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,400
like that for the rest of your life

503
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,480
unless you clean the stuff out of your

504
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:29,760
life the point is the chemical companies

505
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,039
found a way to get into people through

506
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,720
all their chemicals

507
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,960
and it's polluting the environment

508
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:37,600
polluting people aging them fast

509
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,400
making their liver sick making them

510
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,360
viral

511
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:43,200
because it's so poisonous and you guys

512
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,960
got if you guys got a chance you guys

513
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,559
start writing to close companies you

514
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,559
should start writing to

515
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:50,080
other companies saying stop poisoning us

516
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,640
with these chemicals there's no reason

517
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,200
for this

518
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,559
anyway the point is is that we're up

519
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:58,160
against a lot

520
00:18:54,559 --> 00:19:01,200
and the mono cleanse diet is gives you a

521
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,840
chance to cleanse while you still have

522
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,679
energy

523
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,799
you realign your cranial senses yeah

524
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:06,400
you're going to sit you're going to

525
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,960
smell those chemicals out there because

526
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,960
they're

527
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,960
entrenched everywhere but at least

528
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,000
you're getting healthier no matter

529
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,360
what's power of it

530
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,679
what i love about the mono cleanse is

531
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:18,080
the insulin resistance goes away

532
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:19,360
i love that you can cleanse you know

533
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,360
while you're eating

534
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,200
i love that it heals helps to heal

535
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:26,000
digestive problems

536
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,400
how cool is this georgiana good to see

537
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,760
you

538
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:34,080
anthony with what should we uh color

539
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:36,880
our hair with um well okay

540
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:39,440
my hair yesterday and i am not okay and

541
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:43,120
i think it's because of it

542
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:44,960
so look here hair coloring hair coloring

543
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,720
i'm hoping people come out some really

544
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,480
natural hair coloring

545
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,160
i'm hoping that happens i think there

546
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,160
are more natural ones

547
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,679
can try to find them or not scented it's

548
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,400
just the toxic

549
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:57,919
the toxic ones real conventional hair

550
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,919
coloring companies

551
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:02,559
those are yet those are really really

552
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:06,159
rough okay those are really hard

553
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:08,080
and you know and so and

554
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:10,159
and that's the thing is when we go into

555
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:12,159
hair places you got all the clones and

556
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:14,480
fragrances you got all that stuff too

557
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,679
and the hair products are so entrenched

558
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,720
with chemicals

559
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:20,159
but looking for a natural hair dye

560
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,000
is the way to go for sure if you're

561
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:23,520
doing hair care coloring right natural

562
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,440
hair dye's the way to go

563
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:28,400
and i'm hoping better ones keep on

564
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:31,280
coming out the standard conventional

565
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,720
hair color hair coloring dye is

566
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,679
definitely really

567
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:37,440
harsh whoa so yeah i totally get it it's

568
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:38,400
like it's why cleansing is so important

569
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,960
there's some things we

570
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,679
we we get we get into right it's of

571
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,280
course

572
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:45,520
walk out your front door and get into

573
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:47,440
something that's why we're doing like

574
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,000
the mono cleanse it's why we're taking

575
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,520
care of

576
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,280
ourselves that's why we're on day three

577
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,159
to get the stuff out of us build up

578
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:56,799
build to make us

579
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:56,799

606
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,200
hummus i might

607
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:49,280
might crack one crack into one you never

608
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,280
know uh today we'll see

609
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,960

that

611
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,559
so i want to talk about transitioning

612
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,679
get that

613
00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:03,039
off our plate good to see you guys

614
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:04,159

615
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:05,039
youtube good to see you guys on

616
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:08,240
clubhouse

617
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:12,080
okay so

618
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:14,799
what happens is not trying to be harsh

619
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,440
not trying to be tough it's not not

620
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:18,720
doing

621
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:21,440
not trying to be mean but we we

622
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,080
really get spoiled with our foods we do

623
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,280
we do

624
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:26,720
and i get it it's a hard world we we

625
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:30,080
lean on our foods

626
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:33,280
i totally understand and it makes sense

627
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:36,640
no shaming no judgment

628
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:37,360
not judging anyone i know how hard life

629
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,799
is

630
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:44,000
okay had my fair share okay

631
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:45,360
and i know life's not easy i'm just

632
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,960
letting everybody know right here

633
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:50,960
okay and at the same time right

634
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,320
same time that's why i don't judge

635
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,120
anybody for what they eat

636
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,679
never did never judged anybody for what

637
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,840
they

638
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:58,960
for what they eat or anything like that

639
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,039
you know and

640
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,799
and there's a reason for that i've known

641
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:04,240
people people have walked into my office

642
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:06,640
throughout the years

643
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:08,799
you know when i used to see people by

644
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,600
the thousands people would walk into the

645
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:11,679
office

646
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:13,039
and they'd be eating whatever they've

647
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:16,080
eaten whatever

648
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:19,120
and and i never was like

649
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:22,720
oh that's bad how stupid are you

650
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:25,280
how silly are you never ever ever

651
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,960
because it's not easy because there's a

652
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,799
lot of reasons first of all we're taught

653
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,120
not to eat the right things

654
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:32,159
second of all the world is set up to

655
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:35,520
just mess

656
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:38,720
us up it's rigged in a way

657
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:40,240
to keep us sick so our institutions when

658
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,960
we're raised in school and we're going

659
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,559
into school

660
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,640
it just doesn't teach us how to eat

661
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:46,240
right i mean all of it we're just we

662
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,159
come out of this right and it's

663
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:50,240
generations of this

664
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:51,520
and uh thumbs up on this video marissa

00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,039

666
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:55,919

668
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,559
time now

669
00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:00,159
too where we're dealing with the same

670
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:02,080
thing it's life's not

671
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:03,279
life's not easy so we're gonna eat a

672
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,279
whole bunch of things

673
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:07,440
emotionally too we go through a lot of

674
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:09,440
hardships go through a lot of struggles

675
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,640

the stuff and food

is what we run to right we tend to run

682
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,360
to and this is why i really like the

683
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:30,000
mono cleanse

684
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,400
because you weren't put on michelle

685
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,600
miller

00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:34,480
to see you weren't put on a juice

687
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,840
cleanse

688
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:38,080
right a juice cleanse okay that's you

689
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,159
know

690
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:42,799
you know it wasn't something like that

691
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:45,600
the mono cleanse is designed

692
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:46,559
so you can function live your life eat

693
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:50,159
food

694
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:53,200
and still move yourself forward

695
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:55,760
and it could be done long term

696
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,679
now i mean i i've talked to another

697
00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:00,159
doctor friend the other day that's had a

698
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:01,600
patient now on for two years straight on

699
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:04,080
the potato and

700
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,640
butter leaf lettuce and the celery juice

701
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,880
to heal

702
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,480
all these conditions going on and the

703
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:11,520
person the patient said

704
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:14,480
it's been a godsend because

705
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:17,440
they were able to eat food they need

706
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:20,640
have their energy sustain their muscles

707
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:22,000
um eventually get to exercising because

708
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:25,520
they had that strength

709
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,440
and this is this is amazing amazing and

710
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:29,360
they tried everything else before

711
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,919
so what i love about the monofins is

712
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:33,600
just just all these reasons right

713
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:35,279
and if you just came on here you're new

714
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,720

coconut water into it too

740
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,720
you can break it up to coconut water and

741
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,919
water you can do straight coconut water

742
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,400
throughout the day if you really wanted

743
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:35,840

00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:29,919
misinformation that they have

775
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,360
or they just don't want to step on toes

776
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:32,480
when they do learn the right information

777
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,919
for medical medium and they don't want

778
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,240
to step on toast because they don't want

779
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:35,919
to

780
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,159
they don't want to rock their friends

781
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:40,240
you know their relationships they have

782
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:42,720
in the industry it's like

783
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,679

785
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:47,360
the people who need it the most are we

786
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,360
playing games

787
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,480

788
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,799
chronicle

789
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,399
as pawns in a big chess game because

790
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:56,640

791
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:58,320
if chronicle are used as pawns in the

792
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,279
chess game sell them some left in

793
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,279

801
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:15,200
their empires and using the chronicle

803
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,320
everybody's building empires and using

804
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,159
the chronicle to do it

805
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:22,240
without like really looking out for

806
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:23,919
their best interest and

807
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,679
it's critical to look out for the best

808
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:26,080
interest and one of those best interests

809
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:27,760
is

810
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:29,919

your own detective and

980
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:26,079
kind of go back in your history a little

981
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:28,079
bit and see that maybe you were doing

982
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:30,320
stuff that was sweet but didn't know it

983
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:32,079
was sweet

i'm not saying you were on any of this

that i'm about to say but it's for

anybody that's listening

987
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:41,440
did you do any alcohol right

988
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:43,680
because that's the methyl sugar it's

989
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:46,320
really sweet did you do any chocolate

990
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:47,550
this chocolate's always got sugar in it

00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,359

did you do any pizza that's really sweet

994
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:58,440
but what happens is did you do any pasta

995
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,839
did you do any ice cream

did you do any you might not you might

998

feel the bananas are too sweet but i'm

999
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,680
just wondering have you done any of

1000
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:10,839
those

1001
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:14,480
now if you're

1002
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:17,920
thinking why is he saying this

1003
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:20,000
because when you add fat to those sugars

1004
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:22,000
like a chocolate bar that has fat and

1005
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,800
sugar or ice cream that has fat and

1006
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,599
sugar

1007
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:27,520
or pasta that's got fat and sugar or

1008
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:28,240
pizza that's got fat and sugar you can't

1009
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:31,359
tell you're

1010
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:34,160
doing the sweets you can't tell

1011
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:37,200
you're loaded with fat in there right

1012
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:41,920
but when you do the banana by itself

1013
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:45,440
you're like whoa that's sweet whoa

1014
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:47,440
that's because it's not laced in fact

1015
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,640
when you do the banana and lettuce

1016
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:52,190
itself

1017
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:53,440

1189
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:31,839
just talking about potatoes for a couple

1190
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:34,560
of seconds how about that i think that's

1191
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:37,839
a good idea how do you steam potatoes

1192
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:39,680
okay you can get a pot right with one of

1193
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:42,720
those baskets

1194
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:44,400
stainless steel pot with a basket

1195
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:46,560
that you can do it that way stainless

1196
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:49,040
steel pot with a basket

1197
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:49,599
got water on the bottom and the basket

1198
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:51,040
on top

1199
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:53,040
put your potatoes there that's one way

1200
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:54,640
you can do it right another way is you

1201
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:57,319
can buy a steamer

1202
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:58,480
right and i might have a steamer on

1203
00:43:57,319 --> 00:44:01,680

all that

1212
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:18,560
you wanna know what causes one of the

1213
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:20,000
one things that cause it it's the

1214
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:23,119
caffeine

1215
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:26,640

right and toxins all right

1218
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,960
let's go you guys let's talk about this

1219
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:34,240
a little bit more let's go into

1220
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:36,319
transitioning now

1221
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:38,560
so before i show you some other stuff

1222
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:39,280
too at this point many of you guys have

1223
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:41,599
done the

1224
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:42,960
papaya or banana option or the banana

1225
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:44,560
papaya option together

1226
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:46,079
or the steamed potato option or the

1227
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:48,079
steamed pea option right

1228
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:49,599
many of you guys have tried that okay

1229
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:51,200
now you're three days into this

1230
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:52,560
maybe you just started today so then go

1231
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,920
two more days after this we'll talk

1232
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:56,960
about transitioning

1233
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:58,960
and christina

1234
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:01,040
says what's wrong with potatoes with

1235
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:02,480
green spots or sprouts

1236
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:04,400
well it's because the potatoes turning

1237
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:06,400
into something different that's all

1238
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:07,839
you just you know it's not not that

1239
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:10,160
anything's terribly wrong with it it's

1240
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:12,880
just that it wants to start growing

1241
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:14,240
it wants to be put into the ground and

1242
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,920
so you don't want to eat it when it

1243
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:17,440
wants to do that the minute a potato

1244
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,960
starts to change its mind and says you

1245
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:20,079
know what i want to go into the ground

1246
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:22,000
and start to grow

1247
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:23,359
and become a potato plant you don't want

1248
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,920
to eat it

1249
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:27,760
okay because the sprouts and the leaves

1250
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:28,319
it's a lot it's like that with a lot of

1251
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:30,240
foods

1252
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:31,680
a lot of foods not just potato it's like

1253
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:33,920
that with a lot of foods there's

1254
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:34,960
certain stages of foods that you eat

1255
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:38,560
their stage at

1256
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:38,560
right and that's how it works

1257
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,920
don't eat a green potato don't eat a

1258
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:43,440
potato that's sprouting

1259
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:44,960
you don't and the same thing with sweet

1260
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:46,480
taste there's times you don't eat sweet

1261
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:48,079
potatoes don't eat a sweet potato when

1262
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:49,680
they get all those rotten spots

1263
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:51,359
because that's a sweet potato saying hey

1264
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:52,880
i'm done they're sweet

1265
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:54,319
sweet potatoes get when they when they

1266
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:56,000
sit in the fridge too long they get

1267
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:58,000
rotten spots but you can't see them they

1268
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,119
become like pockets every single fruit

1269
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,839
and vegetable

1270
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:03,359
every single food on the planet the same

1271
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:06,960
thing like meat right

1272
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:08,160
don't eat brown meat the sad thing is

1273
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,599
they stop they

1274
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:12,160
they try to stop the meat from being

1275
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:13,040
brown in the store and they cover the

1276
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:16,480
meat with

1277
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:18,240
an ammonia to keep the meat red

1278
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:19,520
so the red is stored in the red no one

1279
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,480
knows it but the meat in this door is

1280
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,839
all red it's a

1281
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:23,839
it's not supposed to be red because it's

1282
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:28,240
already gone bad

1283
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:30,160
monocle and potatoes are grounding if

1284
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:31,680
if you need them to sleep too a lot of

1285
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,880
people have sensitive central nervous

1286
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:35,119
systems

1287
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:36,960
and they can make you sleepy because

1288
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:39,040
they're so grounding and relaxing so

1289
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:41,599
they make you sleepy sometimes because

1290
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:43,200
it helps the body heal it helps nerves

1291
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:44,560
to heal potatoes actually

1292
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:46,400
help nerves to heal you're getting

1293
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:48,000
glucose to your nervous system

1294
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:49,280
here's what happens the minute you take

1295
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,680
out all the fat and you get rid of the

1296
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:54,079
insulin resistance you guys

1297
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:55,359
right now you've got ample glucose for

1298
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:57,920
all your nerves

1299
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:59,839

1309
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:20,800
okay that's how it works a lot of people

1310
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:21,839
are already dealing with fatigue but

1311
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,520
they don't know it

1312
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:25,520
because they're over stimulated they're

1313
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:27,599
jacked up on caffeine they're jacked up

1314
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:29,760
on adrenaline from eating too much fat

1315
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:31,599
they're jacked up on stuff and because

1316
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:33,040
people are so jacked up they don't know

1317
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:34,720
it and they're really fatigued

1318
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:37,359
underneath it all when you remove

1319
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:39,200
all that it also shows that they

1320
00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:41,440
actually have fatigue

1321
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:43,119
now let's say hey that's a window until

1322
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:44,240
really what's happening and now i have

1323
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:47,200
to heal

1324
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:48,079
and then you can nap and rest so you can

1325
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:50,319
heal

1326
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:51,839
part of the healing process of when

1327
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:53,359
you're doing like the mono cleanse or

1328
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:54,640
anything it's part of the healing

1329
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:58,720
process

1330
00:47:54,640 --> 00:48:00,160
it's important transitioning right

1331
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:03,440
first things first to give you the first

1332
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:03,440
thing about transitioning

1333
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:13,520
first things first is you don't want to

1334
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:16,640
start tanking crazy amounts

1335
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:18,880
of crazy food that's just simplistic

1336
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:20,079
it's in a nutshell that's one one thing

1337
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:22,240
right there

1338
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:24,640
you don't want to just get off the mono

1339
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,640
diet

1340
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:31,920
stop at your favorite vegan pizza place

1341
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:32,720
and start tanking you just don't want to

1342
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:34,240
do that

1343
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:35,839
you know there's no reason to put your

1344
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:38,880
body in a shock

1345
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:41,040
right there's a transition section too

1346
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:44,160
in cleanse the heel keep that in mind

1347
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:48,640
remember that read that section

1348
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:49,680
it's important okay and you also don't

1349
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:51,839
want to tank on

1350
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:52,720
a ton of fat and that's what this is by

1351
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:54,640
the way

1352
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:56,000
right but you don't want to take on a

1353
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:57,839
ton of fat

1354
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,520
so you don't want to come off the mono

1355
00:48:57,839 --> 00:49:02,079
cleanse and

1356
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:05,119
you know and start diving into something

1357
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:06,559
crazy you don't want to do that

1358
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:09,760
you don't want to get up you don't want

1359
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:15,200
to come off the mono cleanse

1360
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:15,200
right and you know the whole bit

1361
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:20,079
can you talk about healing from long

1362
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:20,079
covet

1363
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:24,240
let me grab my other book real quick

1364
00:49:28,839 --> 00:49:33,760
so

1365
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:36,079
it's a new edition of medical medium so

1366
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:36,480
long covet is that that whole long cover

1367
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:38,240
thing

1368
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:39,680
stems from medical medium information so

1369
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:41,119
if you hear it out there it originates

1370
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:44,160
from medical medium that's

1371
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:46,640
that's uh fc bar

1372
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:48,559
okay and what happens is that would have

1373
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:50,480
epstein-barr comes back so when we get

1374
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:52,400
knocked down by anything you get knocked

1375
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:54,720
down by the flu you get knocked down by

1376
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:56,800
flu related bugs you get knocked down

1377
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:58,160
by food poisoning you get knocked down

1378
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:01,440
by anything

1379
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:03,119
okay then it reactivates epstein-barr

1380
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:04,480
that's original medical medium

1381
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:07,040
information

1382
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:09,640
it reactivates simplex 1 epstein-barr

1383
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:10,880
simplex 2 set of megavirus shingles

1384
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:14,880
hhv-6h8v7

1385
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:16,400
can reactivate any of them really so

1386
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:19,119
you can look into that book if you

1387
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:20,880
really want to know about that

1388
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:22,559
so you don't want to come off the mono

1389
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:25,040

1400
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:48,480
to get them to do the heavy metal detox

1401
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:51,440

00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:53,119
of how they're doing that is just

1403
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:53,760

1405
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:57,760
truly so when we come off that mono

1406
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:59,599
cleanse

1407
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:01,680

1408
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:03,119
chicken i mean it's not a great thing

1409
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:04,319
just dive into chicken

1410
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:05,359
if you're somebody that eats chicken

1411
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:06,720
every day and you're doing the mono

1412
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:07,440

00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:10,960
take it slow if you're gonna go back to

00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:12,000
chicken take it really slow

1416
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:14,559
that's one thing if you're somebody

1417
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:16,319
who's vegan or plant-based

1418
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:18,319
you're used to a vegan diet that has all

1419
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:20,240
that all the fat in it because you're on

1420
00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:21,200

the mono cleanse this is one of the most

1428
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:35,760

is what i call them

1533
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:43,280
read the cleanse the heal i talk about

1534
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:45,920
radical fats if you're vegan don't

1535
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:48,240
don't jump into all that fake cheese all

1536
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:49,680
the nut butters don't jump into all the

1537
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:53,200
peanut butter

1538
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:56,079
don't just dive into all that

1539
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:57,839
fat right maybe if you're into avocados

1540
00:55:56,079 --> 00:55:59,680
you bring in some avocado you do that

1541
00:55:57,839 --> 00:56:01,280
you bring in your avocado salad at night

1542
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:02,559
maybe you bring in some hummus if that's

1543
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:04,640
something that you do

1544
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:06,079
maybe you bring in that if you're

1545
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:07,599
someone that's already been eating this

1546
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:08,799
way and that's how you like it now i

1547
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:11,680

keep the animal proteins to once a day

1554
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:22,400

i recommend

is not diving into too much of that

1589
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:22,079
when i went off i leaned when i went off

1590
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:24,000
i leaned into the list of mono foods

1591
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:25,599
and started my heavy metal detox

1592
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:28,240
smoothie great

1593
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:29,359
incredible it's hard to see the handle

1594
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:31,200
for some reason

1595
00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:32,559
on tick-tock it's for some reason on my

1596
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:34,079
device it's all the way to the left

1597
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:35,599
where i can't see the handle

1598
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:37,200
sometimes it's crazy but i just read

1599
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:40,319
that on tick-tock

1600
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:42,960
um dr sherry green

1601
00:57:40,319 --> 00:57:42,960
good to see you

1602
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:50,559
so that's the number one

1603
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:51,520
recommendation the number one

1604
00:57:50,559 --> 00:57:55,599
recommendation

1605
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:59,119
is not high diving into

1606
00:57:55,599 --> 00:58:00,000
the oil really important what you do

1607
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:01,359
want to do

1608
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,200
too what you also want to do is you want

1609
00:58:01,359 --> 00:58:06,960
to keep out the poisons

1610
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:09,280
okay don't high dive into the caffeine

1611
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:10,720
it's poison don't high dive into the

1612
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:14,400
vinegar

1613
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:17,760
poison okay don't high dive into

1614
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:18,559
um you know fermented foods which isn't

1615
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:20,480
good for you

1616
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:22,000
i mean it's not the worst for you but it

1617
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:23,839
doesn't help at the same

1618
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,040
time i talked about that for a million

1619
00:58:23,839 --> 00:58:26,480
reasons and i won't go into the

1620
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:27,680
fermented food thing right now

1621
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:30,000
but it's something you just don't want

1622
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:32,559
to just jump into when you're coming off

1623
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:34,319

mineral salts do the

1660
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:58,720

01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:05,599
and um

1665
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:14,400
some potato wedges right

1666
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:16,799
so what i'm doing is i'm making a potato

1667
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:16,799
salad

1668
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:21,920
real simplistic simplicity is so good

1669
01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:26,319
for healing

1670
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:28,400
many times this is a great

1671
01:00:26,319 --> 01:00:30,640
so i'm hoping you guys did this a lot

1672
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:30,640
right

1673
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:34,000
made yourself

1674
01:00:35,839 --> 01:00:43,119
potato salad squeezing a little lemon on

1675
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:46,160
it now

1676
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:48,559
uh lemon seeds are going down in there i

1677
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:51,040
want to get that lemon seed out but

1678
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:53,280
that lemon seed went down went down

1679
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:53,280
there

1680
01:00:54,079 --> 01:01:00,400
this is just one potato you can do more

1681
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:02,559
than one potato right

1682
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:04,799
you can do two potatoes three potatoes

1683
01:01:02,559 --> 01:01:06,559
four

1684
01:01:04,799 --> 01:01:09,119
he doesn't peel the potatoes i see that

1685
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:10,400
on tick tock you can peel them if you

1686
01:01:09,119 --> 01:01:12,319
want

1687
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:14,400
you boil the potato question mark on

1688
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:17,119
tick-tock no don't boil the potatoes

1689
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:18,799
when you boil potatoes the glucose in

1690
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:21,839
the potato

1691
01:01:18,799 --> 01:01:24,000
goes into the broth now you

1692
01:01:21,839 --> 01:01:25,839
unless you're gonna have the soup and

1693
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,599
you make a potato soup so you can try to

1694
01:01:25,839 --> 01:01:29,920
get that glucose back right

1695
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:31,040
but when potatoes are boiled in water

1696
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:34,880
and they're underneath

1697
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:37,760
water potatoes are underneath water

1698
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:39,520
the glucose from the potato leeches into

1699
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:41,119
the water boils out of the potato and

1700
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:43,760
leeches into the water now you got a

1701
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:45,119
potato with very few calories in it

1702
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:48,400
you need the calories you need the

1703
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:50,400
glucose you need to be sustained

1704
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:51,520
and then our brain runs on glucose so

1705
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:52,640
we'll run into that a little bit what i

1706
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:55,760
love about the

1707
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:55,760
mono eating cleanse

1708
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:59,839
your brain starts to die in five seconds

1709
01:01:58,079 --> 01:02:01,520
without glucose

1710
01:01:59,839 --> 01:02:03,200
in five seconds your brain tissue starts

1711
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:05,839
to die

1712
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:08,480
letting you know in 10 seconds your

1713
01:02:05,839 --> 01:02:10,559
brain is already dying

1714
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:11,520
your brain is already dying in 10

1715
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:12,960
seconds

1716
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:15,520
your brain is already dying without

1717
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:20,559
glucose just so you know

1718
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:22,799
in 10 seconds it's already going bye-bye

1719
01:02:20,559 --> 01:02:23,760
keep that in mind that's how important

1720
01:02:22,799 --> 01:02:27,440
glucose is

1721
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:29,440
so when you hear the rhetoric out there

1722
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:31,200
your brain needs fat your brain needs

1723
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:34,720
fat who hasn't been eaten

1724
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:38,240
fat who hasn't been eating fat

01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:40,640

1727
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:44,559
day

1728
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:48,000
fish meat eggs chicken

1729
01:02:44,559 --> 01:02:49,760

1730
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:52,640
olive oil who hasn't been eating fat

1731
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:54,799
every day in their life

1732
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:57,280
that's do you do you find that things

1733
01:02:54,799 --> 01:02:58,720
don't make sense out there or

1734
01:02:57,280 --> 01:03:00,319
or what i mean think about that one

1735
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:02,880
because i'm i'm kind of i'm scratching

1736
01:03:00,319 --> 01:03:04,720
my head about that one you need fat

1737
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:07,200
that's what you need uh the brain needs

1738
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:07,839
fat um you need fat in order to heal you

1739
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:10,079
need fat

1740
01:03:07,839 --> 01:03:11,440
for your hormones i mean are you kidding

1741
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:12,720
that everybody's sick

1742
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:14,319
and they're eating fat and they're

1743
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:15,039
eating fat and they're eating fat i mean

1744
01:03:14,319 --> 01:03:16,960

01:03:18,319 --> 01:03:22,960
put it on there you're wrong no one eats

1748
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:22,960
fat

1749
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:29,280
and and so but with your brain

1750
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:31,039
you can take fat out of your diet your

1751
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:33,920
brain will start to heal

1752
01:03:31,039 --> 01:03:36,000
i just want you to know this piece you

1753
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:39,039
can take fat out of your diet

1754
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:43,520
your brain starts to heal

1755
01:03:39,039 --> 01:03:46,640
brain inflammation starts to heal

1756
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:49,680
you can't take sugar out of your diet

1757
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:51,520
your brain starts to die because your

1758
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:54,559
brain is mostly made out of sugar

1759
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:56,839
news flash glycogen storage

1760
01:03:54,559 --> 01:03:58,079
and the brain tissue itself runs on

1761
01:03:56,839 --> 01:04:01,599
glucose

1762
01:03:58,079 --> 01:04:04,400
so why is everything twisted out there i

1763
01:04:01,599 --> 01:04:06,480
purposely think there's plants in

1764
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:09,119
natural medicine

1765
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:09,520
to purposely confuse the bear so people

1766
01:04:09,119 --> 01:04:11,920
stay

1767
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:13,839
sick it's a game of chess like no one's

1768
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:15,760
ever seen on our planet

1769
01:04:13,839 --> 01:04:17,920
you know why do you think they they're

1770
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:20,079
removing supplements into ins and making

1771
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:22,319
them forbidden to use why do you think

1772
01:04:20,079 --> 01:04:23,680
supplements are being removed away from

1773
01:04:22,319 --> 01:04:25,440
the people

1774
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:27,359
and and going under the guise of now

1775
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:27,839
prescription and stuff it's a game of

1776
01:04:27,359 --> 01:04:30,640
chess

1777
01:04:27,839 --> 01:04:32,400
to just to really torture people along

1778
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:34,160
the way and alternative medicine

1779
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:36,559
is a place where there's lots of plants

1780
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:38,000
in there so that you stay confused

1781
01:04:36,559 --> 01:04:39,599
and if you're strong enough and you're

1782
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,960
young enough and strong enough you can

1783
01:04:39,599 --> 01:04:42,880
stay confused and just

1784
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:45,280
mess around while your acne comes back

1785
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:47,200
and forth or some skin problems or

1786
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:49,119
some fatigue and you can play the game

1787
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:50,640
be like well i need fat or i need this

1788
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:51,680
now i need collagen powder or i need

1789
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:55,039
this and that and

1790
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:56,480
you can play the game right and but

1791
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:58,160
the minute you're really sick that's

1792
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:59,760
when you know something's up and an

1793
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:01,520
alternative medicine is a place where

1794
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:02,319
there's so many pitfalls and so many

1795
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:05,520
potholes

1796
01:05:02,319 --> 01:05:08,720
just like conventional medicine

1797
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:09,520
isabel once i took the fats out adhd

1798
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:12,400

1800
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:18,880
