[824.96 - 827.20] amazing
[826.24 - 828.40] so
[827.20 - 829.76] here we are
[828.40 - 831.68] we're dealing with
[829.76 - 833.36] a situation where someone's walking
[831.68 - 835.44] around they got tinkles and numbness
[833.36 - 837.12] they got aches and pains they got all
[835.44 - 839.84] kinds of mystery symptoms maybe they got
[837.12 - 841.68] dizziness maybe they got vertigo maybe
[839.84 - 843.76] they got any they could have anything
[841.68 - 845.84] going on that's neurological so why is
[843.76 - 847.92] it happening people get the epstein-barr
[845.84 - 849.76] virus it sits inside their liver
[847.92 - 851.92] it feeds off of all kinds of toxins and
[849.76 - 853.36] poisons like metals and all kinds of
[851.92 - 855.04] petrochemicals and everything else that
[853.36 - 856.56] get inside pharmaceuticals old
[855.04 - 859.04] pharmaceuticals and that are sit inside
[856.56 - 860.72] people's liver and then the virus
[859.04 - 862.08] goes to the bathroom the virus
[860.72 - 864.16] eliminates
[862.08 - 867.04] it goes to bathroom
[864.16 - 869.52] when the virus goes to bathroom
[867.04 - 873.12] it's releasing poisons and toxins those
[869.52 - 875.44] poisons and toxins float around the body
[873.12 - 876.72] and inflamed nerves someone's walking
[875.44 - 878.32] around with knee pain that's
[876.72 - 879.92] unexplainable back pain that's
[878.32 - 883.20] unexplainable jaw pain that's
[879.92 - 885.44] unexplainable neck pain head pain
[883.20 - 886.96] dizziness ringing in the ears all kinds
[885.44 - 888.88] of different conditions what's happening
[886.96 - 889.92] is those neurotoxins are floating around
[888.88 - 892.00] the body
[889.92 - 893.84] and inflaming nerves
[892.00 - 896.24] so keep that in mind so neurological
[893.84 - 898.00] symptoms are all those neurotoxins
[896.24 - 899.36] floating around the body produced by
[898.00 - 901.84] viruses
[899.36 - 904.08] inflaming the nerves
[901.84 - 905.84] so keep that in mind pamela says order
[904.08 - 907.36] the book amazing i'm so glad i can't
[905.84 - 908.88] wait for you to read it your mind's
[907.36 - 910.84] going to get blown
[908.88 - 913.84] okay
[910.84 - 917.60] so the whole thing about neurological
[913.84 - 920.08] symptoms is you have to be able to kill
[917.60 - 921.84] viruses you have to be able to kill the
[920.08 - 923.36] bugs creating them and getting the
[921.84 - 925.36] poisons and toxins out or at least
[923.36 - 926.88] killing the bugs so let's talk about
[925.36 - 930.24] supplements and dosages and why that's
[926.88 - 933.12] important okay so i'm going to put
[930.24 - 934.96] him back over here
[933.12 - 936.88] so we're in the subs and dosages where
[934.96 - 939.60] neurological symptoms you'll see cat's
[936.88 - 941.92] claw in there
[939.60 - 944.32] neurological lyme
[941.92 - 946.64] anybody can get diagnosed with all you

[954.16 - 957.60] neurological lyme diagnosis has can
[956.08 - 959.44] still get that diagnosis that's how it
[957.60 - 961.28] works you walk it depends on what doctor

[1054.96 - 1058.80] supplement right that's vimergy by the
[1056.72 - 1061.84] way that's the one that i recommend i'm
[1058.80 - 1064.72] not sponsored by vimergy and i do not
[1061.84 - 1066.88] own the company that's important to know
[1064.72 - 1069.60] some people be like he loves vimergy why
[1066.88 - 1071.04] well i love energy because a i know them
[1069.60 - 1073.52] just like and and
[1071.04 - 1076.24] they're good people but i know
[1073.52 - 1077.92] all the stuff most supplement company
[1076.24 - 1079.44] and product out there supplement
[1077.92 - 1081.12] different things out there companies i
[1079.44 - 1083.28] know all the people because i try to get
[1081.12 - 1085.52] relationships with all the companies out
[1083.28 - 1087.52] there in hopes
[1085.52 - 1089.44] that they upped the quality
[1087.52 - 1091.44] in hopes that they up the quality and
[1089.44 - 1093.36] vimrji went to that standard the highest
[1091.44 - 1095.76] standard that i've ever seen and that's
[1093.36 - 1097.68] why i recommend them all the time a lot
[1095.76 - 1099.60] of the supplement companies i know okay
[1097.68 - 1101.28] when they go to that level
[1099.60 - 1102.88] the members you went to i will be
[1101.28 - 1104.88] recommending them every single day
[1102.88 - 1106.96] you'll see their stuff here so that's
[1104.88 - 1108.64] important enough and
[1106.96 - 1110.56] and so yeah but i'm not sponsored these
[1108.64 - 1112.48] incredible incredible products so that's
[1110.56 - 1114.32] the cat's claw right there so what it
[1112.48 - 1115.68] says in here for neurological symptoms
[1114.32 - 1116.96] and ask your doctor what's right for you
[1115.68 - 1119.36] but this is what i would do if i was
[1116.96 - 1121.04] sick it says two dropper fulls twice a
[1119.36 - 1122.88] day so i'm gonna put some cat's claw in
[1121.04 - 1124.00] here two dropper fulls of cat squad
[1122.88 - 1125.52] right there
[1124.00 - 1128.08] says twice a day
[1125.52 - 1130.08] so keep in mind and i like what i like
[1128.08 - 1132.16] to do is i like to become friends with
[1130.08 - 1134.72] supplement company owners out there
[1132.16 - 1136.40] because i have this dream of
[1134.72 - 1138.56] will you do the right thing and make the
[1136.40 - 1141.04] stuff the best so and then the
[1138.56 - 1142.88] friendships blow up like i'm now like
[1141.04 - 1144.32] not friends with a few companies because
[1142.88 - 1146.56] i asked them over and over again to
[1144.32 - 1149.44] increase their quality and they said no
[1146.56 - 1151.20] we're not and so i'm like okay well
[1149.44 - 1152.48] and then they get mad and i'm like whoa
[1151.20 - 1154.88] okay you don't want to be friends just
[1152.48 - 1156.72] because i'm i'm hounding you to increase
[1154.88 - 1158.64] your quality
[1156.72 - 1160.40] it's just it's annoying right
[1158.64 - 1161.60] anyway so we got that the cat's gone
[1160.40 - 1163.68] right there
[1161.60 - 1166.32] so now golden seal
[1163.68 - 1167.76] golden seal is antibacterial it's
[1166.32 - 1170.56] antiviral
[1167.76 - 1171.92] i love it goldenseal is an important one
[1170.56 - 1174.00] right there so when someone's dealing
[1171.92 - 1176.56] with neurological symptoms chronic
[1174.00 - 1178.32] fatigue is a neurological symptom all on
[1176.56 - 1180.72] its own so that's the golden seal right
[1178.32 - 1181.68] there it says one drop or full twice a
[1180.72 - 1183.44] day
[1181.68 - 1185.52] is what it says so that's one dropper
[1183.44 - 1187.28] full and if you look if you want to do
[1185.52 - 1189.52] instead of twice a day and this is what
[1187.28 - 1191.20] i do like for friends and stuff i'll be
[1189.52 - 1193.36] like look if you got to do two in one
[1191.20 - 1195.28] shot and you do you do your you know you
[1193.36 - 1198.72] do it once a day then that's what you do
[1195.28 - 1202.08] right zinc is critical
[1198.72 - 1204.40] for healing neurological symptoms zinc
[1202.08 - 1207.28] is critical for healing
[1204.40 - 1209.76] neurological conditions symptoms viral
[1207.28 - 1212.08] issues pathogen issues zinc is critical
[1209.76 - 1213.68] you guys on tick-tock it's so important
[1212.08 - 1215.44] it really is and you guys aren't rubble
[1213.68 - 1217.52] it's so important so what it says in
[1215.44 - 1219.20] here it says zinc it says one drop or
[1217.52 - 1221.04] full twice a day
[1219.20 - 1222.80] of zinc now you might be like well i'll
[1221.04 - 1224.16] just go get zinc somewhere yeah you
[1222.80 - 1225.84] could do that but you'll probably get a
[1224.16 - 1227.36] zinc that has citric acid in it you'll
[1225.84 - 1230.48] probably get a zinc that has chemicals
[1227.36 - 1232.72] in it i talk about this in the book
[1230.48 - 1234.80] this is important to know okay when
[1232.72 - 1237.28] you're in this book you read that
[1234.80 - 1239.36] chapter and you'll see how to protect
[1237.28 - 1240.88] yourself with the crap that's out there
[1239.36 - 1243.12] i can't even tell you how important that
[1240.88 - 1245.52] is you guys i can't even tell you
[1243.12 - 1247.52] courtney may good to see you
[1245.52 - 1250.24] um i read your comments on youtube you
[1247.52 - 1252.48] guys if you like the video thumbs up or
[1250.24 - 1254.40] whatever or like the video whatever if
[1252.48 - 1256.56] you hate the video or not having a good
[1254.40 - 1257.60] time still give me a thumbs up give me a
[1256.56 - 1259.76] thumbs up
[1257.60 - 1261.52] all right so we got the zinc right there
[1259.76 - 1264.56] so that's important it's critical when
[1261.52 - 1266.00] it comes down to the immune system
[1264.56 - 1267.92] if you're sick
[1266.00 - 1269.36] something went wrong with the immune
[1267.92 - 1272.32] system
[1269.36 - 1274.72] if you're sick with something
[1272.32 - 1277.20] something went wrong with your immune
[1274.72 - 1279.84] system if you're sick
[1277.20 - 1281.04] if you got neurological symptoms
[1279.84 - 1284.64] something
[1281.04 - 1288.56] somewhere along the way in your life
[1284.64 - 1291.04] went wrong with your immune system
[1288.56 - 1294.16] if you're sick with two symptoms three
[1291.04 - 1297.20] symptoms five symptoms 10 symptoms
[1294.16 - 1298.88] 50 symptoms
[1297.20 - 1300.16] something went wrong with your immune
[1298.88 - 1301.12] system
[1300.16 - 1304.16] okay
[1301.12 - 1305.36] that's why knowing protocols knowing
[1304.16 - 1307.52] dosages
[1305.36 - 1309.68] knowing what to do
[1307.52 - 1311.20] is critical
[1309.68 - 1312.88] that's why when you look in here and it
[1311.20 - 1314.80] says neurological symptoms that's where
[1312.88 - 1316.40] i am if you just came on here tightness
[1314.80 - 1318.64] in the chest trembling hands twitches
[1316.40 - 1320.24] and spasms muscle weakness tingles and
[1318.64 - 1321.84] numbness restless legs restlessness
[1320.24 - 1323.20] weakness of the limbs muscle spasms
[1321.84 - 1326.24] aches and pains you want to know the

[1368.56 - 1372.16] about it if you're suffering and
[1369.84 - 1374.48] struggling cheryl says for one year i've
[1372.16 - 1375.84] been juicing 32 ounces of celery juice

[1379.36 - 1384.40] i also keep it fat free until at least
[1382.08 - 1386.32] two o'clock p.m very smart
[1384.40 - 1388.56] i also take a few vimergy supplements
[1386.32 - 1391.28] like the vimergy supplements here if you
[1388.56 - 1393.36] said that you are speaking right now
[1391.28 - 1395.76] about
[1393.36 - 1399.20] healed my allergies and some strep
[1395.76 - 1399.20] conditions as well thank you
[1399.28 - 1403.44] however my hair is so thin and lost so
[1401.36 - 1406.56] much i'm devastated
[1403.44 - 1409.20] the hair comes back for so many people
[1406.56 - 1410.80] the whole thing millions of women are
[1409.20 - 1412.88] losing their hair
[1410.80 - 1414.56] i talk to doctors who focus on the keto
[1412.88 - 1415.52] diet all their patients are losing their
[1414.56 - 1417.28] hair
[1415.52 - 1419.20] i talked to doctors on their vegan diets
[1417.28 - 1421.52] doctors are focused on vegan diets and
[1419.20 - 1423.04] they contact me and they said why why
[1421.52 - 1424.96] what's with the hair thinning and all
[1423.04 - 1426.32] their women are losing hair and their
[1424.96 - 1428.72] pain their women patients are losing
[1426.32 - 1431.04] their hair talk to paleo diet people
[1428.72 - 1432.88] doctors that love the old paleo diet
[1431.04 - 1434.88] they're all losing their hair animal
[1432.88 - 1437.60] protein diets plant-based diets they're
[1434.88 - 1440.08] losing their hair the reason why
[1437.60 - 1442.32] if you had caffeine in your life
[1440.08 - 1444.40] there's a ticking time bomb that happens
[1442.32 - 1445.52] later and the hair comes out for women
[1444.40 - 1447.04] because women aren't supposed to lose
[1445.52 - 1448.80] their hair women are never supposed to
[1447.04 - 1450.72] lose a hair
[1448.80 - 1453.20] and so if you're under stress and the
[1450.72 - 1455.04] adrenals are overloaded from stress
[1453.20 - 1456.96] right and you've got the caffeine
[1455.04 - 1458.96] running and you got vinegar's another
[1456.96 - 1460.96] one that doesn't help right
[1458.96 - 1464.00] high fat diet all those years doesn't
[1460.96 - 1464.80] help sluggish liver all these things add
[1464.00 - 1466.40] up
[1464.80 - 1468.16] all these things have intermittent
[1466.40 - 1470.16] fasting the wrong way i've seen hair
[1468.16 - 1471.76] fall out for people for that if someone
[1470.16 - 1473.52] has a difficult experience a
[1471.76 - 1475.04] relationship experience they have a
[1473.52 - 1477.20] trying time with a relationship they
[1475.04 - 1478.96] have a hardship the adrenals then lose
[1477.20 - 1480.40] that that hormone they need because
[1478.96 - 1482.48] that's i talk about the medical medium
[1480.40 - 1484.48] books that your adrenal has to have all
[1482.48 - 1488.88] set of hormones there's a specific
[1484.48 - 1491.44] hormone to keep hair and follicles alive
[1488.88 - 1493.20] okay so and basically what happens is
[1491.44 - 1495.04] all these factors play a role the
[1493.20 - 1496.56] caffeine is a big one and then the hair
[1495.04 - 1498.08] comes out later
[1496.56 - 1500.40] so what i would do is just keep on
[1498.08 - 1502.88] healing keep on doing all heal all the
[1500.40 - 1504.96] all the critical stuff right
[1502.88 - 1507.12] and then focus on maybe take take the
[1504.96 - 1509.20] hair hair protocol doctor to you to the
[1507.12 - 1511.20] hair protocol to your doctor here
[1509.20 - 1513.44] and then and then work on that and guess
[1511.20 - 1514.88] what on medical medium i've seen so many
[1513.44 - 1516.24] women that lost their hair get their
[1514.88 - 1517.76] hair back on medical medium where they
[1516.24 - 1520.16] came to medical medium
[1517.76 - 1521.92] with all their hair missing alopecia
[1520.16 - 1523.60] thinning hair all of it and they got
[1521.92 - 1525.68] their hair back
[1523.60 - 1527.44] and so there's always hope so just just
[1525.68 - 1529.52] know that there always is all right so
[1527.44 - 1531.68] we're on neurological symptoms let's do
[1529.52 - 1534.08] licorice root licorice fruit is critical
[1531.68 - 1535.92] for neurological symptoms right
[1534.08 - 1537.84] that's an important one
[1535.92 - 1540.16] is licorice root so and i don't see a
[1537.84 - 1542.08] licorice root right here so but but let
[1540.16 - 1544.40] me see if i can grab one right here too
[1542.08 - 1545.44] licorice fruit is critical when it comes
[1544.40 - 1548.00] down to
[1545.44 - 1549.92] neurological symptoms i got a licorice
[1548.00 - 1552.96] root right here that's the vimergy
[1549.92 - 1555.68] licorice root gonna put that in here
[1552.96 - 1557.76] that's important
[1555.68 - 1561.20] so
[1557.76 - 1562.56] is that a joke copper is the most reason
[1561.20 - 1564.64] if you lose hair
[1562.56 - 1566.32] too little copper
[1564.64 - 1568.56] that's not why people lose hair it's not
[1566.32 - 1570.48] copper well so the copper
[1568.56 - 1572.96] copper will give you a lot of other
[1570.48 - 1574.32] problems if you have too much copper but
[1572.96 - 1576.32] little copper you might have been
[1574.32 - 1578.08] reading somebody else's comment
[1576.32 - 1579.84] having less copper is nothing to do with
[1578.08 - 1580.96] hair loss that's a great way to give
[1579.84 - 1582.16] somebody copper poisoning because
[1580.96 - 1583.60] imagine how many women are going to be
[1582.16 - 1585.28] dowsing copper
[1583.60 - 1586.40] copper supplements and making themselves
[1585.28 - 1588.40] real sick and then they're gonna have
[1586.40 - 1590.32] raging eczema raging psoriasis
[1588.40 - 1592.32] depression from copper
[1590.32 - 1594.16] more neurological symptoms from copper
[1592.32 - 1596.88] like lots of copper supplements and
[1594.16 - 1598.56] copper whatever devices and utensils and
[1596.88 - 1600.88] all that yes stay away from the copper
[1598.56 - 1602.80] jewelry stay away from the copper that
[1600.88 - 1604.40] that right there is a nightmare for
[1602.80 - 1606.08] people that will not help somebody get
[1604.40 - 1608.24] better the trends out there are so
[1606.08 - 1610.00] painful it's like if you're like if
[1608.24 - 1611.76] you're like into creating a copper

[1693.36 - 1697.68] into thyroid right now we're heading in
[1694.64 - 1700.32] there now um thyroid conditions let's
[1697.68 - 1703.20] sit there real quick first
[1700.32 - 1704.64] okay 546 uh in this book so we're in
[1703.20 - 1705.92] thyroid conditions and cleanse the heel
[1704.64 - 1707.60] right now you guys we're talking about
[1705.92 - 1710.88] protocol supplements
[1707.60 - 1712.64] what to do dosages on protocols we're
[1710.88 - 1715.44] talking about all of that
[1712.64 - 1716.88] and here we are so thyroid conditions
[1715.44 - 1718.24] true cause of thyroid conditions you
[1716.88 - 1719.76] have to realize there's over 60
[1718.24 - 1722.32] varieties of epstein-barr virus
[1719.76 - 1724.56] epstein-barr enters into the thyroid
[1722.32 - 1727.12] that's what it does very important to
[1724.56 - 1727.12] know okay
[1728.00 - 1731.60] epstein-barr
[1730.08 - 1733.92] leaves the liver
[1731.60 - 1736.08] after you've had mono
[1733.92 - 1738.64] and it heads up to the thyroid at some
[1736.08 - 1740.88] time in your life this is some of the
[1738.64 - 1741.84] most important information you can ever
[1740.88 - 1742.72] learn
[1741.84 - 1744.88] because
[1742.72 - 1748.32] everyone's getting diagnosed with a
[1744.88 - 1750.32] thyroid condition and has no idea why so
[1748.32 - 1752.32] how are they going to heal their thyroid
[1750.32 - 1754.72] condition if they don't know why they
[1752.32 - 1758.32] have a thyroid condition
[1754.72 - 1759.76] did you ever think about that one right
[1758.32 - 1762.72] epstein-barr
[1759.76 - 1764.64] sits inside the liver
[1762.72 - 1766.64] after you've had mononucleosis when
[1764.64 - 1769.04] you're younger
[1766.64 - 1770.72] it stays in there and eventually when
[1769.04 - 1773.44] your immune system gets kicked down for
[1770.72 - 1775.84] some reason like i said immune system
[1773.44 - 1778.56] the epstein bar leaves the liver
[1775.84 - 1781.04] and it heads up to your thyroid
[1778.56 - 1782.72] it enters into the thyroid by burrowing
[1781.04 - 1784.88] into the thyroid
[1782.72 - 1786.96] and then it lives there where it creates
[1784.88 - 1789.12] cysts and nodules
[1786.96 - 1791.28] this is medical medium info that science
[1789.12 - 1793.20] science is finally taking from me even
[1791.28 - 1795.60] though it's not good because they take
[1793.20 - 1796.80] it and they just mess it up and
[1795.60 - 1798.24] and they don't cite back where the
[1796.80 - 1800.16] information they took from comes from
[1798.24 - 1801.36] which is the mnm books the medical
[1800.16 - 1803.04] textbooks
[1801.36 - 1804.96] but you end up with epstein-barr in the
[1803.04 - 1808.16] thyroid and then it does damage and you
[1804.96 - 1810.08] get your hypothyroid every single person
[1808.16 - 1812.24] is going to have a hypothyroid or
[1810.08 - 1814.56] hashimoto's or hyperthyroid or graves
[1812.24 - 1816.24] disease or system nodules diagnosis in
[1814.56 - 1820.08] their day
[1816.24 - 1822.08] because of the viral epidemic causing it
[1820.08 - 1825.68] so giving you a quick rundown about that
[1822.08 - 1825.68] so that's important right there okay
[1825.76 - 1830.56] so we're in cleanse the heel if you guys
[1827.52 - 1833.28] don't have the book amazon.com

[1928.24 - 1931.60] the reason why people don't get better
[1929.92 - 1933.12] is they don't know what to do
[1931.60 - 1934.48] they don't know what to do
[1933.12 - 1935.84] and the medical media books have already
[1934.48 - 1937.76] proven themselves
[1935.84 - 1939.84] i can sit here and
[1937.76 - 1941.76] stand on a soapbox
[1939.84 - 1944.80] i can sit here shout it from the
[1941.76 - 1947.60] rooftops i can sit here on a mountaintop
[1944.80 - 1949.68] and shout it all day long
[1947.60 - 1951.28] because the books have worked and turned
[1949.68 - 1953.52] people's lives around and fixed the
[1951.28 - 1955.52] thyroid i just how many people i see
[1953.52 - 1957.68] stories every single day my god you
[1955.52 - 1959.44] fixed my hashimoto's oh my god your book
[1957.68 - 1961.28] saved me my hashimoto's is gone oh my
[1959.44 - 1963.44] god my hypothyroidism is but my doctor
[1961.28 - 1965.44] can't believe it hey my cyst on my
[1963.44 - 1967.60] thyroid disappeared after doing medical
[1965.44 - 1970.00] medium protocols for thyroid oh my god
[1967.60 - 1971.68] like it's all the time out there
[1970.00 - 1975.36] spirulina is one of the things to use
[1971.68 - 1977.68] that's the vibrancy spirulina lysine
[1975.36 - 1980.08] when you're dealing with these viruses
[1977.68 - 1983.52] that create thyroid problems you need
[1980.08 - 1986.72] the lysine to knock down the viral load
[1983.52 - 1988.88] viral load
[1986.72 - 1990.64] you need the lysine to knock down the
[1988.88 - 1992.32] viral load
[1990.64 - 1994.72] because these viruses that create
[1992.32 - 1996.40] thyroid problems are herpetic
[1994.72 - 1998.80] really important to know right there
[1996.40 - 2001.20] vitamin b12
[1998.80 - 2003.52] okay what does it say vitamin b12 one
[2001.20 - 2005.20] drop or full twice a day get your
[2003.52 - 2006.96] dropper full in there
[2005.20 - 2009.36] get very important
[2006.96 - 2011.36] so magnesium glycinate
[2009.36 - 2013.60] hey well no i'm taking magnesium and how
[2011.36 - 2014.88] come my thyroid is not better
[2013.60 - 2016.56] well one reason is you're probably
[2014.88 - 2017.92] taking magnesium
[2016.56 - 2019.68] but you're not taking magnesium
[2017.92 - 2022.40] glycinate
[2019.68 - 2024.08] so it's not absorbing
[2022.40 - 2026.88] absorbing
[2024.08 - 2028.32] you're not feeding your cells it's that
[2026.88 - 2030.08] magnesium glycinate that does the
[2028.32 - 2032.08] difference where it feeds the cell so
[2030.08 - 2037.36] it'll say magnesium glycinate on here
[2032.08 - 2040.32] one capsule twice a day is what it says
[2037.36 - 2042.96] microc so it has vitamin c is what it's
[2040.32 - 2044.96] recommending in here right
[2042.96 - 2048.80] vitamin c
[2044.96 - 2051.60] um six capsules twice a day
[2048.80 - 2053.52] so in order to knock down viral loads
[2051.60 - 2055.76] you've got to have your immune system
[2053.52 - 2057.12] being fed with that antioxidant that
[2055.76 - 2060.00] vitamin c
[2057.12 - 2061.76] that's the immune building antioxidant
[2060.00 - 2064.00] that vitamin c
[2061.76 - 2065.12] really important
[2064.00 - 2068.32] so
[2065.12 - 2069.60] you gotta have the vitamin c if you have
[2068.32 - 2072.72] look you look
[2069.60 - 2074.56] if you get overwhelmed do one thing
[2072.72 - 2076.88] one thing ask your doctor do one thing
[2074.56 - 2078.40] i'll take a little b12 it says here in
[2076.88 - 2081.12] the book you could read the chapter and
[2078.40 - 2082.64] you could read like how you can navigate
[2081.12 - 2084.48] do one thing
[2082.64 - 2086.88] do two things
[2084.48 - 2089.92] but know you're on the right right track
[2086.88 - 2091.92] know that you're on the right track

[2093.28 - 2097.04] right direction

[2099.20 - 2103.60] wonderful products that cost a lot of
