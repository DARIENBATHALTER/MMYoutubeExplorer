00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,439
this

34
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:18,560
information because I can promise you

35
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:21,520
this it's going to be really interesting

36
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,680
extremely interesting okay first of all

37
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,240
I just want to do a couple little things

38
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,960
before we go into daylight savings hell

39
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,880
this what I call it daylight savings

40
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,759
hell before I go into that little bit I

41
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,200
just want to see what I got here what is

42
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:34,720
what am I looking at I'm looking at some

43
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,200
potatoes because I'm going to be making

44
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,799
some crinkle cut fries with a little

45
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,079
crinkle knife right here I'm going to

46
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:44,000
make some crinkle

47
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:46,079
fries because I'm having Burgers going

48
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,680
to do the Millet burgers in this pot

49
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:51,759
right here I got some Millet piping

50
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:55,600
freaking hot right there in this pot you

51
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:58,079
can see it okay and then what I have

52
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:01,119
here is an assortment of leafy greens

53
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:04,479
leafy greens a term I did did not hear

54
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:08,000
before medical medium information didn't

55
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:09,560
hear it the hygienic Health movement

56
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,840
they didn't talk about leafy greens the

57
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:13,959
most they ever said was Roma lettuce

58
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,480
going all the way back the raw folks

59
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:18,840
they didn't talk about leafy greens the

60
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:20,239
raw folks were just eating lettuce and

61
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,920
the health movement in general didn't

62
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,080
talk about leafy greens and leafy herbal

63
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,480
greens like herb greens didn't talk

64
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,360
about that either but we did something

65
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,080
in the health realm Spirit of compassion

66
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,879
and I and the medical medium team

67
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,160
helping we got the word out there about

68
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:35,760
leafy

69
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:38,319
greens yes we got the word out there and

70
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,400
now you hear it in the strangest places

71
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:42,120
friend of mine said they saw a

72
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,800
commercial a TV commercial was like one

73
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,000
of the fast food restaurants and the guy

74
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,800
on there was like we have leafy greens

75
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,760
with our chicken and our burgers and I

76
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,519
was like don't want to hear it I don't

77
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,680
want to hear it because first of all

78
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:58,920
it's ridiculous because it's a term it's

79
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,360
a medical medium ter term and it's

80
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,560
important to know that because it brings

81
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,560
you back to the importance of leafing

82
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,640
grein like all about it and why and

83
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07,920
everything around it and how it's so

84
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,519
important those details are critical

85
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,239
remember the details matter with all of

86
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:15,440
it it's not that I want a plug for every

87
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:17,920
single thing mm info did no I mean that

88
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,879
would be nice to get people back to the

89
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,760
start right but most importantly it's

90
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:23,959
about the chronically ill and then and

91
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,720
they're actually bumping into walls and

92
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:27,760
they're looking for help and theyve seen

93
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:30,280
10 doctors and they've done a ton of

94
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,239
antibiotic treatments they've done a ton

95
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:34,480
of this and a ton of that and they've

96
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,840
tried everything and they've been in

97
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,560
oxygen Chambers they like buy oxygen

98
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,400
Chambers and they're in oxygen you know

99
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,799
therapy and they're just laying in there

100
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,680
for hours upon hours you know thinking

101
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,760
the oxygen chamber is going to like just

102
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:49,000
fix them and next thing you know it

103
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:51,000
they're dipping in the cold bathtubs

104
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,519
covered in ice and they're doing that

105
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,519
and next thing you know it they're

106
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:57,400
trying something else and it's endless

107
00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:59,079
endless endless and they try this

108
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,720
supplement that supplement this Elixir

109
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:03,680
that elixir and they stay sick and when

110
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:05,799
they find medical medum information

111
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,959
something happens you guys know have you

112
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:11,319
been around from the first book that was

113
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:13,560
released something magical happens you

114
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:16,639
actually find out why you're sick like

115
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:19,199
really find out why you're sick and how

116
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,120
to heal and then you're on your journey

117
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,520
and then you're healing and you're

118
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:25,400
moving forward and it matters but today

119
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:27,000
we're talking about cutting boards we're

120
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,680
going to be talking about cutting boards

121
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,320
today I hope you have your cutting board

122
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,080

123
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,240
front of you right now we're going to be

124
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,560
making the Millet Burgers too beef

125
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:40,320

126
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:42,440
burgers bow Vine burgers with the juices

127
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,600
from the animal grease all grease

128
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:46,440
dripping out of the meat and the blood

129
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,120
all cooked up in the burger we're not

130
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,600
going to do those we're doing there's

131
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,840
nothing wrong if someone actually eats

132
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,440
meat half the medical mem Community I

133
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:58,360
think are meat eaters um of course

134
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:59,960
because we are not discriminatory to

135
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,840
animal protein and you can can actually

136
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:04,120
heal while doing animal pro protein but

137
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,560
you have to know how to do it and you

138
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,080
can actually heal if you're vegan you

139
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,639
just have to know how to do it and you

140
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:11,800
can heal if you're pescatarian just need

141
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:13,199
to know how to do it you can heal if

142
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,639
you're vegetarian and doing medical

143
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:19,360
medium you just need to know how to do

144
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:23,759
it and then you can do it so let's do it

145
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:25,039
all right so moving on moving on okay

146
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:29,039
good good good

00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:31,440

going to make sure it's nice and ready I

157
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,319
just cooked it let's talk about Daylight

158
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:54,560
Savings

159
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:57,440
Time have you ever been in a situation

160
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:00,160
where Daylight Savings Time happens and

161
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,919
you feel worn down from it

162
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,800
now I know if many of you guys know

163
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:05,319
medical mum information going back I've

164
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:08,039
talked about it first in the health

165
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:11,319
realm it wasn't considered a health

166
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:13,919
issue so mm info brought D daylight

167
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:15,960
savings to town as far as in The Chronic

168
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:18,720
Leo and health department and health

169
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:20,599
issues other than that it wasn't talked

170
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,280
about except for other reasons like the

171
00:06:20,599 --> 00:06:26,520
economy so why was Daylight savings put

172
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:30,759
together one of the biggest reasons was

173
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:34,840
economics economy it was to benefit the

174
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:37,520
economy the bottom line the dollar and

175
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:39,639
that's why daylight savings came to town

176
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,639
but is that the real reason because

177
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:47,000
remember this there's always some

178
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:50,160
Sinister evil plot behind a lot of the

179
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,199
big mainstream things going on now I'm

180
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:56,400
not saying everything mainstream has an

181
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:58,440
evil plot behind it but believe me most

182
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:01,120
everything in mainstream does have an

183
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:03,199
evil plot and there are things in the

184
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,280
alternative stream that have evil plots

185
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:08,639
too along with it but this one here

186
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:11,120
daylight savings is on another level of

187
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:14,080
evil one of the reasons why they do

188
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:17,520
daylight savings is to make your life

189
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:19,520
miserable yes now the powers that be on

190
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:23,400
this planet the

191
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:28,720
illumination on this planet they think

192
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:31,759
every way possible they think in any way

193
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:35,160
possible how can they make human life on

194
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:38,720
this planet more difficult a bigger

195
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:41,280
struggle much more of a hard time

196
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,919
obstacles pitfalls

197
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:47,199
traps tiger

198
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:50,360
snares and so one of those is let's

199
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,919
change the time around let's do that on

200
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:54,240
people we'll have them running on the

201
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:56,240
hamster wheel we'll have them tripping

202
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,759
over themselves you might think well how

203
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,280
does it really hurt us you know when the

204
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:03,360
time change comes everything should be

205
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:05,080
fine I'm okay just a little extra tired

206
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,960
when the time change

207
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:11,240
comes but it's more than that it throws

208
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:14,440
off people who are sensitive it throws

209
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:17,039
off people who are struggling and sick

210
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:20,520
it throws off people mentally

211
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:22,639
emotionally it's a trigger for people

212
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:26,240
who a bipolar trigger for people who

213
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:28,720
have depression anxiety OCD OCD is a big

214
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,840
one right there one thing that people

215
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,039
don't understand understand is when

216
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,599
daylight savings occurs when they change

217
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:37,919
the clock where they turn it back or

218
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:39,360
forward OCD and many people most people

219
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:43,240
they struggle they may not even

220
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:45,680
attribute it to that time change but it

221
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:49,399
can throw people with OCD into a major

222
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:54,279
Tail Spin one that can set them back for

223
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:56,320
months until the time gets changed again

224
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:58,160
and then after they've somehow

225
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,640
stabilized with their OCD even though

226
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,360
they're struggling and and other things

227
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:04,880
may trigger them comes along the time

228
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:07,800
change again and then somebody with OCD

229
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:10,200
boom they're now triggered again and

230
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:12,800
they're on that hamster wheel of OCD

231
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,920
hell because of the time change now you

232
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,800
may think well hey why would the

233
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:20,079
alumination be thinking about things

234
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:22,640
like this they do massive think tanks

235
00:09:20,079 --> 00:09:26,279
with massive money behind it and

236
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:29,959
evildoers that do sit around and make

237
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:32,760
charts and power points on this very

238
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:35,560
stuff because they think about the

239
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:38,240
things that make our lives worse and

240
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:41,760
more miserable like for instance baby

241
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:45,480
formula baby formula with GMO corn oil

242
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:49,320
GMO soy in it the worst ingredients

243
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:52,880
you've ever seen in it baby formula you

244
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:55,200
would think the world would know by now

245
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:57,160
that they can make a better healthier

246
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,200
baby formula for moms that can't

247
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:02,839
breastfeed but no they won't and they

248
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:07,160
won't go there instead the baby formula

249
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:10,760
will be the worst crap there is there's

250
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:12,519
a reason for that this is what they want

251
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:14,200
same thing with daylight savings and I

252
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:16,720
could I could make a list of this stuff

253
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:18,839
going all the way back for years about

254
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,560
the things that they actually purposely

255
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:23,920
make the way they

256
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:25,079
do so that it causes more trouble or

257
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,360
harm or

258
00:10:25,079 --> 00:10:28,880
difficulties so daylight savings so why

259
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,040
should that bother anybody overall if

260
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:33,160
you have some type of emotional

261
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,399
struggles whatever it is or you you got

262
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:36,320
some type of condition a mental

263
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:39,279
condition you're suffering and

264
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:43,079
struggling from anxiety depression

265
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:47,720
sadness depersonalization that's a big

266
00:10:43,079 --> 00:10:51,480
one it throws off the neurons it

267
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:53,320
actually sends neurons in a tail spin so

268
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:55,800
the first thing that happens when the

269
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:59,160
time changes

270
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:01,959
forcibly is neurons start to heat up

271
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:04,240
when they heat up Metals start to cook

272
00:11:01,959 --> 00:11:06,680
they start to oxidize faster they start

273
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,680
to move

274
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,399
around and what happens is our brain is

275
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,519
challenged so every time there's a time

276
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:15,560
change our brain becomes challenged and

277
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,680
do you think indigenous cultures going

278
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,880
all the way back you think the Native

279
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:21,360
Americans you think they had a time

280
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:23,399
change going on you think so so when

281
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:27,200
November 1 came

282
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:29,519
along in a Native American village make

283
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,720
sure you tell everybody across North

284
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,639
America

285
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:36,720
everybody that we're gonna change the

286
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:40,120
time we're gonna do

287
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:43,839
that it just doesn't happen it never

288
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:47,160
did but we do it here because as the

289
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:50,720
centuries have gone by and time has gone

290
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:54,240
by certain powers at be govern the

291
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:56,600
planet and we know that you know that if

292
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,120
you still don't know that then uh that's

293
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,160
a nice bubble you're in I'd like to

294
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:02,639
climb into that Bub bub with you and be

295
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,560
like yeah the world is perfect nothing's

296
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:07,839
going on this bubble's amazing give me

297
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:10,519
this bubble you're in I would love that

298
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:12,519
bubble but it's not really truly reality

299
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:14,440
of what's happening and daylight savings

300
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:17,959
is a prime

301
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:20,880
example prime example of how the world

302
00:12:17,959 --> 00:12:24,079
works of how the hierarchy

303
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:26,760
works so when it comes down to Daylight

304
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:29,639
Savings time when it comes down to

305
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:32,399
spring ahead fall back and everything

306
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:36,959
else that they've termed it and coined

307
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:40,279
it it disturbs balance so it's geared

308
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:42,920
and created just to disturb the balance

309
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:44,320
of life and if you're somebody and it

310
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:47,000
really doesn't throw you much doesn't

311
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:49,760
throw you much but it does does throw

312
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,160
you much now Canary and the coal mine I

313
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,560
want to go into that a little bit so

314
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,600
what's a canary and a coal mine so you

315
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:57,040
got a

316
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:59,959
canary nice yellow canary right here and

317
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:02,880
it's in a cage in a

318
00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:06,000
mine carved deep into the Rock Tunnel

319
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:07,680
deep into the Rock right when the air

320
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,720
and the oxygen the oxygen starts to

321
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:14,920
diminish the canary sings a different

322
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:18,120
tune and the miners hear it they hear a

323
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:20,600
canary struggling so the point is is you

324
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:24,279
don't want to wait until the canary

325
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:27,360
dies and falls to the bottom of the cage

326
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:29,800
you want to hear the canary sing a

327
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,800
different tune

328
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,720
you want to hear the canary say

329
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:35,560
something different so when the miners

330
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:38,639
were working it wasn't just about

331
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:40,680
checking the bird in the box or checking

332
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,720
the bird in the cage oh it's still alive

333
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:45,160
we're okay let's keep on mining let's

334
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:49,480
keep on mining right the bird's okay in

335
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:52,360
the cage they would pay detailed

336
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:55,440
attention to the canary cuz they didn't

337
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:57,480
have oxygen meters back then they

338
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,279
couldn't be like well the oxygen in this

339
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:01,639
cave we just dug

340
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:04,279
is actually diminishing it's at 15%

341
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:06,839
oxygen now it's at 14% oxygen now it's

342
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:08,680
on 12% oxygen now we're down at 8%

343
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:10,000
oxygen and we're struggling they didn't

344
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:12,360
have the

345
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,920
meters so they used the canary and when

346
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,759
the canary would actually sing a

347
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:19,839
different

348
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:22,959
tune it's the sound the voice of the

349
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:26,160
canary the chirp would alter and that's

350
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:28,279
the first thing you looked for what's

351
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,759
happening the last thing you wanted is

352
00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:33,320
to just get down into that hole and look

353
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:35,279
into that cage and see a canary dead and

354
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,759
then realize you can't breathe and you

355
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:39,720
can't make it

356
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:43,959
back daylight savings

357
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:48,000
time is like sucking the oxygen out of

358
00:14:43,959 --> 00:14:51,160
human life ever so

359
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:56,720
gently ever so

360
00:14:51,160 --> 00:15:00,000
small ever so subtle but that's what it

361
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:03,000
does when you're 90 years old if you've

362
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,759
been blessed to make it to 90 and you're

363
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,440
in a nursing

364
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:11,440
home that time

365
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:14,360
change can determine life or death that

366
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,880
time change can get a worker who's

367
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:20,000
taking care of a 90-year-old in a

368
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:22,079
nursing home off their

369
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,160
game that time

370
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:27,360
change can get

371
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:30,160
a conductor of a

372
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:33,560
train with a bunch of passengers in it

373
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:37,000
off its game their game that time change

374
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:39,079
can get a pilot in the sky in a plane

375
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,639
off their

376
00:15:39,079 --> 00:15:45,199
game it can change the way we feel the

377
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:46,120
way we think can make us more forgetful

378
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:49,680
in the

379
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:52,639
moment can make us more apprehensive can

380
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:55,079
make us less Discerning can make us too

381
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:59,279
Discerning can throw off our judgment

382
00:15:55,079 --> 00:16:01,360
calls and so every time a time change

383
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:02,440
time changes and they don't measure this

384
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,160
cuz they don't want to measure this

385
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:07,160
science doesn't want to look at this

386
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,800
every time the time changes a bunch of

387
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:12,000
 happens on this

388
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:13,680
planet a bunch of accidents happen a

389
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,759
bunch of moms driving their kids to

390
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,360
school

391
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:19,959
crash yeah all in different states in

392
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:22,120
different cities in different towns

393
00:16:19,959 --> 00:16:23,720
because they're off their game maybe

394
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,000
maybe a mom didn't get their caffeine

395
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,680
and they're all groggy headed cuz

396
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,759
they're just sick every day maybe a mom

397
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:31,639
got too much caffeine maybe whatever

398
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:32,920
whatever it is or maybe a dad on a

399
00:16:31,639 --> 00:16:36,639
construction

400
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:38,920
job because rushing to work cuz the time

401
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:41,399
change maybe somebody else maybe

402
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:43,279
somebody who was drunk all night all

403
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:45,000
jacked up they're usually used to

404
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:47,800
getting home at 4 in the morning they

405
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,440
time their alcohol consumption as they

406
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:52,000
leave the party or the bar or the club

407
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:53,959
and their time change throws something

408
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,319
off and now boom they're crashed with

409
00:16:53,959 --> 00:16:57,279
somebody

410
00:16:55,319 --> 00:16:59,079
else they shouldn't have been driving

411
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:00,480
drunk but either way they had their

412
00:16:59,079 --> 00:17:02,199
system down while they were driving

413
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,759
drunk and now their systems thrown off

414
00:17:02,199 --> 00:17:06,720
it's these subtleties I'm just talking

415
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:09,000
about all these different

416
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,720
subtleties you're not measuring it

417
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,559
science isn't measuring it no one's

418
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:17,480
measuring it but when it happens the

419
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:19,919
illumination Powers at be are measuring

420
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:22,000
it they know what's happening and they

421
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:25,199
know a storm occurs every time the

422
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,679
time changes they know it cuz people are

423
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:28,919
off their

424
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:31,200
game and they know the people that are

425
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:33,799
the most sensitive feel it the worst

426
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,000
like the canary and when we're talking

427
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:36,320
about the chronically ill and we're

428
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,240
talking about sick people we're talking

429
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:41,440
about

430
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:43,679
canaries people who they're

431
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,960
sensitive they they can't be that

432
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:48,320
indestructible 22y old that hasn't

433
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:50,080
really had a Health Challenge yet that's

434
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,640
working out every day and doing this and

435
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,679
doing that and drinking what they want

436
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:57,000
eating what they want running here going

437
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:58,640
here and then surfing here they can't be

438
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,120
like that right now in their Liv life

439
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:03,280
they're not at that State they're at a

440
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:05,039
place where they got ticks and Tremors

441
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:08,400
and vibrations through the body and

442
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:10,880
sleep problems and sleep apnea insomnia

443
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:13,200
all kinds of different mental issues too

444
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,559
depression anxiety OCD bipolar whatever

445
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,840
all the different things they got going

446
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:20,159
on and then you get old people that are

447
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:22,679
older Elders time change knocks them

448
00:18:20,159 --> 00:18:25,280
hard it knocks grandpa and grandma and

449
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:27,720
great grandma and Great Grandpa hard and

450
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:30,200
the powers at be the hierarchy knows

451
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:31,520
this and understands this completely

452
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:34,120
understands this because that's the

453
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,240
whole nature of the deception and that's

454
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:37,440
part of the

455
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:39,000
evil that's it's not the greatest evil

456
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,559
in the world it's not the biggest evil

457
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,720
in the world but let me tell you it

458
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:44,360
changes when that time changes then

459
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,440
everything on the planet changes and

460
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:50,400
 happens

461
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:52,039
and Calamity occurs happen stance

462
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,840
happens

463
00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:56,840
everywhere everywhere happen stance

464
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:58,720
happens here happen stance happens there

465
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:02,600
happen stance happens there and

466
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:05,360
goes wrong all around wherever they done

467
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:06,840
that time switch on people it throws

468
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,200
them

469
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:10,799
off people who can't see good and can't

470
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,760
drive at night end up driving in the

471
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:14,480
dark

472
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:16,480
now when they never drove at the dark in

473
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,960
the dark at that time of day when that

474
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,159
time changes and now they're driving in

475
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:22,280
the dark for the first time at that time

476
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:24,400
of day when they never did before

477
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:26,880
Calamity happens they're in an accident

478
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:30,480
on highway and somebody else gets

479
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:34,200
killed this is the stuff they Revel in

480
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:37,360
and love they love this destruction they

481
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:39,320
love injuries they love hardship they

482
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,520
love sickness and the thing is the time

483
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:43,280
change it worsens chronic illness it

484
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:45,360
worsens all the canaries and chronic

485
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,720
illness it starts to break them down a

486
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,799
little bit and then you got to recover

487
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:51,720
recoup and then the next one comes you

488
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:55,159
got to recover recoup and it's not like

489
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:57,480
daylight savings um The Wizard of

490
00:19:55,159 --> 00:19:59,280
daylight savings in the sky isn't saying

491
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:01,679
make sure you drink extra celery juice

492
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,880
make sure you do your hmds make sure you

493
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:04,520
take care of yourself make sure you do

494
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,360
your spinach soup make sure you do your

495
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:07,600
aloe vera they're not telling you to do

496
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:10,159
that make sure you do your zinc make

497
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:11,640
sure you do more B12 to overcompensate

498
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:13,960
for the daylight savings time it's not

499
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:16,240
like this big pie in the sky and I in

500
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:17,840
the sky big brother and so forth up

501
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,760
there isn't telling you you should

502
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:22,640
probably be on Mor B12 when we change

503
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:26,200
the time on you and mess you up but they

504
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:28,720
don't cuz nobody cares it's a term I

505
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:31,360
know very well nobody

506
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:33,640
cares that's how it works in this

507
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:35,520
world Death By A Thousand Cuts is

508
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:38,320
something they love to do too it's all

509
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:41,200
packaged in the same thing you know

510
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,400
what's crazy is here we are you think

511
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,840
that people are looking out for the

512
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,960
chronical ill you think that's happening

513
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:49,000
now after all the work I've done for 35

514
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,600
years all all the work I'm sure a lot of

515
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,320
other people have done helping people

516
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:55,200
with chronic illness you think that the

517
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,600
message would be out there but no people

518
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,360
with chronic illness still get told

519
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,840
they're crazy still get cold told

520
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,960
they're lazy still get told there's

521
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,240
nothing wrong with them it's all in

522
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,520
their head that they're make believing

523
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,480
their symptoms conditions and their

524
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:08,000
diagnoses they're still being told all

525
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:09,799
this stuff then on top of

526
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,159
it

527
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:13,880
there's all the sand being thrown in

528
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:15,360
everybody's face there's all these

529
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,919
monkey wrenches being thrown in

530
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:19,640
everybody's

531
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:23,360
wheel and that's how it's done on this

532
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:25,720
planet but the daylight savings is

533
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:28,600
hierarchy kind of like April Fool's Day

534
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:31,320
on everybody that's how it works

535
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:35,400
it's there for reason and hopes that the

536
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:39,720
numbers rise every time they switch that

537
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:41,000
time fatalities rise yeah that's right

538
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:44,919
and with every

539
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:47,400
fatality there's a gain for illumination

540
00:21:44,919 --> 00:21:49,760
with every sick person there's a

541
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:51,320
gain with every person that gets sicker

542
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,080
and sicker and a problem happens there's

543
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:54,559
a gain in a Reliance on the system and a

544
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:56,640
Reliance on the medical system that's

545
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:59,320
how it's built and daylight savings time

546
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:02,240
is all about helping to break the

547
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:04,080
medical system and when you help to

548
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:08,200
break the medical system things just

549
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,200
start falling apart everywhere and all

550
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,559
around and that's part of what the

551
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,120
illumination does and that's part of

bit

623
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:03,640

624
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:06,640
too when you do with steamed potatoes

625
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:10,320

626
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,320

taught about your cutting boards what's

736
00:30:30,279 --> 00:30:34,559
happening there because and what do you

737
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:37,399
actually put on your cutting boards are

738
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:38,919
you a vegetarian are you plant-based are

739
00:30:37,399 --> 00:30:40,080
you somebody that you're plant-based but

740
00:30:38,919 --> 00:30:41,320
somebody else in your family is not

741
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,519
plant-based they're eating animal

742
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,760
products and their animal products are

743
00:30:42,519 --> 00:30:46,000
going on The Cutting

744
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,399
Board and you're just like oh my God

745
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,679
there's chicken on my cutting board

746
00:30:47,399 --> 00:30:51,559
there's chicken on my cutting board

747
00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:52,919
you're freaking out is that happening

748
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:54,480
then you should have a separate cutting

749
00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:56,240
board so I will say this to anybody

750
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:58,919
who's living in a house it's my first

751
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:01,960
tip is if you're living in a house with

752
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:04,200
somebody else that's actually cooking

753
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:05,679
chicken and they're cutting chicken up

754
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:07,080
and it's on The Cutting Board and all

755
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:08,720
that and they take a sponge and they

756
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:11,200
clean it all up and everything and you

757
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,360
come along and you now actually do stuff

758
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,519
on The Cutting Board you got some

759
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:18,120
lettuce on here or whatever it's like

760
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:21,559
Russian Roulette in the worst way so one

761
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:23,399
of the tips I have to offer which is

762
00:31:21,559 --> 00:31:26,240
definitely have a separate cutting board

763
00:31:23,399 --> 00:31:30,159
if it's at all possible or flip the

764
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:32,360
board and mark the board so board

765
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:34,799
flipping is my first tip of the day but

766
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:36,440
we're going to go into mold and bacteria

767
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:39,320
we're going to go into some other stuff

768
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:41,399
too we we ain't done with just flipping

769
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:42,720
the board that's not the only thing

770
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:45,080
we're going to talk

771
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:47,960
about all

772
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:49,880
right so say I'm cooking a chicken here

773
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:52,039
on this

774
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:53,279
board and I'm actually are cooking a

775
00:31:52,039 --> 00:31:55,320
chicken preparing a chicken and I'm

776
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:58,360
cutting it up and it's raw and it's all

777
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:59,639
raw chicken on here

778
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:01,360
and you don't have another cutting board

779
00:31:59,639 --> 00:32:03,039
in the house but somebody does that you

780
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:05,639
don't want to actually you know use that

781
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:09,159
board you want to learn how to flip the

782
00:32:05,639 --> 00:32:11,000
board but you want to mark the board so

783
00:32:09,159 --> 00:32:13,039
you want to make sure you put a

784
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,799
permanent marker somewhere on the edge

785
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:17,799
that points an arrow

786
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:19,760
down or points an arrow in a certain

787
00:32:17,799 --> 00:32:21,919
direction that arrow pointing in a

788
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,919
certain direction will be your side of

789
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:25,080
the

790
00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:27,240
board that's a really helpful thing to

791
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:29,000
do so when someone's done and you want

792
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:32,080
to make your food and someone actually

793
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:34,000
had raw meat on the board some type of

794
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:38,120
animal product or chicken on the board

795
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:39,720
you can flip it after they did it and

796
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:41,120
you got it I see someone talking about

797
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:42,919
peroxide and we're going to talk about

798
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:44,440
peroxide in the board peroxide ain't the

799
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:47,679
only

800
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:48,840
answer so that's one tip all on its own

801
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:51,960
if you have somebody in the family

802
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:53,519
that's actually using something deadly

803
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:56,720
like raw

804
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:58,960
chicken because raw chicken obviously

805
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,440
can kill a lot of people it has in the

806
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:03,360
past it just

807
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:05,440
does it's not an anti-chicken talk it's

808
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:07,320
just a fact anybody who loves chicken

809
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:09,120
and eats chicken they have to be careful

810
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:11,480
or they can get in trouble and they can

811
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:14,960
get really

812
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:17,279
sick so when it comes down to cutting

813
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:20,120
boards here's one tip that's very

814
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:23,480
important you don't want to get wetness

815
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:24,760
under your cutting board if your cutting

816
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:27,200
board sitting there on the counter and

817
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:28,080
it's a wood cutting board or any kind

818
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,960
would cuz that's what we're talking

819
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:32,519
about today you don't want it moist or

820
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,000
damp underneath the cutting board so

821
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:35,679
what you want to do on the counter with

822
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:41,279
your cutting board

823
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:44,320
is you want to take a dry

824
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:47,880
towel and you want to get the board off

825
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:52,039
the counter a little bit with the dry

826
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:54,919
towel so you got your board on a

827
00:33:52,039 --> 00:33:57,760
towel what this does is if you have

828
00:33:54,919 --> 00:34:01,120
drippage so you cut up tomato es you cut

829
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:04,919
up something wet something juicy you cut

830
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:07,039
up fruit apples you're cutting lemons

831
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:08,240
and then dripping or you're using water

832
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:12,000
on your board for some reason you're

833
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:13,040
cleaning it and the drips then roll down

834
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,200
go

835
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:17,240
down and they end up going under the

836
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:21,399
board they travel under the board and

837
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:23,599
mold starts to happen very quickly like

838
00:34:21,399 --> 00:34:25,879
instantaneously mold will start to grow

839
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:29,320
underneath your cutting

840
00:34:25,879 --> 00:34:32,159
board now mold does some weird stuff

841
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:36,399
mold can travel through

842
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:39,359
wood without it even looking like it can

843
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:41,280
mold doesn't just get down to say a

844
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:45,679
millimeter layer inside your cutting

845
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:47,720
board mold can travel through the board

846
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:50,240
how does it travel through the

847
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:52,000
board most everybody's cutting boards

848
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:54,679
are not one

849
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:58,079
piece they're glued

850
00:34:54,679 --> 00:35:01,920
together cutting boards are multiple

851
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:05,440
pieces glued together that's the cutting

852
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:09,040
boards are now long gone are the days

853
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:12,599
where there was Old Oaks and old wood

854
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:15,440
old growth wood where you cut this one

855
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:18,839
piece and that's your cutting board this

856
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,839
one piece of

857
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:29,040
wood cutting boards are pieces put

858
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:30,040
together mold will travel without it

859
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:34,079
being

860
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:38,160
seen through each

861
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:41,760
slab right through the glue mold loves

862
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:46,359
glue the glue used for cutting

863
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:48,599
boards it actually can use glue to

864
00:35:46,359 --> 00:35:51,359
travel and so even though that glue is

865
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:55,800
hard and that board is pressed

866
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:57,319
together mold can still grow through the

867
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:59,920
glue

868
00:35:57,319 --> 00:36:01,560
and get deep into your board you might

869
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:03,200
be somebody that's like well only one

870
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:05,319
side of my board has mold I'm going to

871
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:07,119
flip the board over and a lot of people

872
00:36:05,319 --> 00:36:09,760
do that I can't afford to get another

873
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:12,079
board right now so I'm going to flip the

874
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:13,680
board over and the moldy side of the

875
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:15,640
board is there I like that I like when

876
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:17,440
people do that that's a good thing you

877
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:18,560
can do you can flip your board and have

878
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,800
the

879
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:23,160
mold on the other

880
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:25,040
side eventually though the mold will

881
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:27,160
grow through the glue and you won't see

882
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:30,000
the mold on your other side your clean

883
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:32,000
side but it will be

884
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:35,400
there it'll

885
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:37,319
be within the glue itself through each

886
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:39,680
section of the

887
00:36:37,319 --> 00:36:41,359
board another thing about mold and

888
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:43,200
cutting boards is there's people out

889
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:45,079
there that are mold

890
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,599
freaks they're making sure there's no

891
00:36:45,079 --> 00:36:48,160
mold in their house there's no mold

892
00:36:46,599 --> 00:36:49,720
under their kitchen counter sinks

893
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,760
there's no mold in their bathrooms

894
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:54,160
there's no mold in their

895
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:56,000
showers they got mold meters and the

896
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:59,560
mold meters are actually saying there's

897
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,319
no mold in their house but their board

898
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:03,359
is

899
00:37:00,319 --> 00:37:05,720
moldy and they don't even know it they

900
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:07,319
have a moldy

901
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:11,200
board

902
00:37:07,319 --> 00:37:14,520
now let's go into what we can lay on a

903
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:17,760
board what we can put on a board you're

904
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:20,160
thinking you got to oil up your

905
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:23,400
board first thing that happens when you

906
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:24,760
get a brand new cutting board is you're

907
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,319
probably told or you're probably

908
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:28,599
thinking that you got to oil up the

909
00:37:26,319 --> 00:37:28,599
board

910
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:33,440
so you got to drop a little bit on there

911
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:35,040
so let's put a little on here right here

912
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:37,839
I'll show you two with a little close-up

913
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:38,680
maybe we could get but I'll put a little

914
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:41,280
bit

915
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:43,280
on put a lot more on there cuz people

916
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:46,640
put olive oil on their boards but I'm

917
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:51,599
not telling you to put olive oil on your

918
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:53,440
boards my boards stay dry and oil free

919
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:56,000
not because I'm afraid of olive oil I'm

920
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:58,000
not afraid of olive oil not because I'm

921
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:01,079
afraid of pemp oil not because I'm

922
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:03,079
afraid of walnut oil not because I'm

923
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:04,920
afraid of avocado oil not because I'm

924
00:38:03,079 --> 00:38:09,000
afraid of coconut

925
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:12,839
oil when you put oil on your cutting

926
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:16,640
boards you're proliferating the bacteria

927
00:38:12,839 --> 00:38:20,520
levels and you're proliferating the mold

928
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:22,960
levels so when you lay oil on your

929
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:28,040
boards you're

930
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:30,520
encapsulating mold and bacteria

931
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:31,720
in between the oil and the wood and then

932
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:35,079
the

933
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:36,280
bacteria stays alive and preserved

934
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:39,240
within the

935
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:42,680
oil and then

936
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:46,079
grows it grows it spawns couple of

937
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:48,760
things go on that bacteria has

938
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:50,920
oxygent that's on the surface of the air

939
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:55,000
and mixed in the oil when you rub it in

940
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:57,599
so you're rubbing oxygen into the board

941
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,440
oxygen doesn't necess necessarily stop

942
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:01,680
bacteria from growing that's how how it

943
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:04,720
works at

944
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:07,119
all in this situation you're rubbing the

945
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:09,160
oil base with the oxygen and you're

946
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:10,800
mixing it all up with the bacteria

947
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:13,560
you're shoving it down into the wood

948
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:16,359
fibers and bacteria is really

949
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:18,880
small and you think you got a nice clean

950
00:39:16,359 --> 00:39:21,599
oily surface now and instead you got

951
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:24,760
bacteria growing inside your board

952
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:26,960
underneath the oil in the oil inside the

953
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:29,440
the wood fibers

954
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:33,000
in the wood pulp you have bacteria

955
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:36,000
growing I don't recommend

956
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:39,760
oiling or fattening up your

957
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:44,000
boards it's not a good idea you can't

958
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:47,040
kill bacteria well the oil will also go

959
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:49,400
deep down into the first or second layer

960
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:51,359
a good millimeter maybe even 2 millimet

961
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:55,240
of your board maybe even 3 mm of your

962
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:58,119
board and harbor and safe hold lots of

963
00:39:55,240 --> 00:40:00,680
bacteria and mold

964
00:39:58,119 --> 00:40:02,319
so you think you got a clean board I'm

965
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:03,800
going to rub the oil on here right there

966
00:40:02,319 --> 00:40:05,960
you think you got a clean board you

967
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:09,160
think you're you oiled it up nice you

968
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:11,839
protected it oiled up your board and all

969
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:15,680
you did was create a playground and a

970
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:18,880
petri dish your board becomes a petri

971
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:22,560
dish for

972
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:25,000
bacteria viruses if they're

973
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:27,079
there if somebody cut their finger while

974
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,280
cooking and they got an epine bar

975
00:40:27,079 --> 00:40:31,440
somebody cut their finger while they're

976
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:33,760
cooking and they got hsv1 2 someone cut

977
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:37,599
their finger and they got hhv7 whatever

978
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:39,800
it is it's in the board ceglar virus HPV

979
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:41,680
it's in the board because it's not going

980
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:43,280
to die it's going to sit in the board on

981
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,839
the board and the oil is going to

982
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:46,480
preserve it and keep it there for quite

983
00:40:44,839 --> 00:40:49,520
a long

984
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:53,400
time and it might even procreate while

985
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:55,560
it's actually there bacteria will for

986
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:56,920
sure so I'm giving you this little

987
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:58,680
tidbit right here which is very

988
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:00,760
important and valuable which is don't

989
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:03,440
oil up your

990
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:06,160
boards don't grease them up oil them up

991
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:08,319
don't avocado oil them up don't walnut

992
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:11,560
oil them up don't cookon oil oil them up

oil them either Lane says wow wow now I

998
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:32,480
realized I didn't have problems with

999
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:35,160
mold until properly oiled the

1000
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:38,800
board oiling your

1001
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:41,720
board will create a mold Fest and a

1002
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:44,200
bacteria Fest in and on your board

1003
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:45,960
eventually also possibly getting through

1004
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:48,760
your

1005
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:51,119

00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:13,960
right here let's get the cutting

1039
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:15,520

let me do the sink over

1043
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:26,720
here never do

1044
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:29,960
that never

1045
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:32,359
do that reminds me of people that like

1046
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:34,680
they're so anal and OCD about something

1047
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:36,240
a certain something and mean something

1048
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:39,000
else it's just like

1049
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:40,319
what do you ever run into that out there

1050
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,520
there's people out there they're so anal

1051
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:44,000
about something like so anal about

1052
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:45,680
something like off the charts right but

1053
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:49,200
then all of a sudden they got this going

1054
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:49,200
on and they're doing this it's like

1055
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:53,599
what I've seen people like don't dirty

1056
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:55,760
up my car don't put a single thing on

1057
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:57,880
the floor don't get sand in my car floor

1058
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:59,520
don't get dust on my car what is that is

1059
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:01,920
that a bag of chips don't get the grease

1060
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:04,079
from the bag of chips on the

1061
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:05,680
thing but I'm going to go pick up a

1062
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:07,160
piece of gum off a sidewalk and they'll

1063
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:09,559
just throw it in their mouth and chew it

1064
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:11,800
up you don't think people do that no

1065
00:44:09,559 --> 00:44:14,280
they don't but they go and do other

1066
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:15,880
things they go on to a kissing Fest

1067
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:17,319
maybe they go into a kissing Fest where

1068
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:19,599
they're kissing

1069
00:44:17,319 --> 00:44:21,839
people they got their mouth inside

1070
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:24,359
somebody else's mouth they're exchanging

1071
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:26,680
every single microb and bacteria and

1072
00:44:24,359 --> 00:44:28,520
virus and meanwhile you get in their car

1073
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:30,200
they're screaming at you because you

1074
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:32,800
actually touch your your feet to the

1075
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:32,800
floor of the

1076
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:40,280
car you want a designated sponge for

1077
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:42,680
your cutting

1078
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:45,839
board you just do all right let's go

1079
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:45,839
into some cleaning of The Cutting

1080
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:53,720
Board cleaning dry and

1081
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:55,680
clean you want the wood dry now what

1082
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:56,800
you'll see out there mainstream is no

1083
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:59,359
the

1084
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:02,599
wood will be ruined your cutting board

1085
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:04,960
will be ruined you just bought a brand

1086
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:07,680
new wooden cutting board and you're

1087
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:10,480
going to keep it all dry like that where

1088
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:12,559
it's dry how are you going to do that

1089
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:15,079
you got to oil that board man you're

1090
00:45:12,559 --> 00:45:16,280
you're destroying your cutting board

1091
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:17,880
you'll hear that out there that's the

1092
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:20,880
mainstream

1093
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:20,880
view

1094
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:26,599
mainstream isn't always right you want

1095
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:28,160
your board dry

1096
00:45:26,599 --> 00:45:29,599
to the bone of course it's going to be

1097
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,960
wet when it's wet because you're using

1098
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:31,960
your designated sponge and you're

1099
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,240
cleaning it and everything and we're

1100
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:34,760

1101
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:36,920
use to clean your board so let's head

1102
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:39,880
there too but first of all you want your

1103
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:42,559
board dry no oil and you want it where

1104
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:44,640
the board looks like it's starting to

1105
00:45:42,559 --> 00:45:47,720
bleach but you're not bleaching your

1106
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:49,240
board with a bleach which takes me to

1107
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:50,680
the another another level there what are

1108
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:53,079

clean it but not toxic and the lemon

1114
00:46:03,319 --> 00:46:09,800
juice Theory it's a cute

1115
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:11,520
one where you put lemon juice on the

1116
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:13,680
board I've seen people do raw meat on

1117
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:16,160
the board and then they squeeze lemon

1118
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:20,680
afterwards and they wash it down with

1119
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:20,680
lemon juice and they're like done that's

1120
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:26,319
clean that's not

1121
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:29,480
enough I just saw lemon on I with a

1122
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:34,240
question lemon question it's not

1123
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:37,200
enough you want nothing on here no food

1124
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:39,920
no fruit no vegetable

1125
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:43,880
juice no

1126
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:45,359
oils nothing but water but you still

1127
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:46,720
need to clean the board so here's one of

1128
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:48,160
the tricks your board will end up

1129
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:49,680
collecting things lots of different

1130
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:52,160
things on top of your hardened food

1131
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:54,240
different stuff and after you've taken

1132
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:56,680
off the stuff that's loose you take off

1133
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:58,319
all the stuff that's loose okay

1134
00:46:56,680 --> 00:47:01,800
after you do

1135
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:06,359
that you want to get water on your

1136
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:10,680
board you want water water becomes a

1137
00:47:06,359 --> 00:47:12,520
killer for microbes not a thriver check

1138
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:14,720
this out nobody knows this stuff it's

1139
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:17,319
it's all mm

1140
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:20,079
info mm

1141
00:47:17,319 --> 00:47:23,520
info what is

1142
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:23,520
it mm

1143
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:30,119
info okay water

1144
00:47:26,599 --> 00:47:33,960
is an inhibitor why water swells the

1145
00:47:30,119 --> 00:47:33,960
wood it swells the

1146
00:47:35,079 --> 00:47:42,839
wood it swells it that swelling of the

1147
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:45,000
wood brings out Bug Killers naturally in

1148
00:47:42,839 --> 00:47:48,920
the

1149
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:51,200
tree so you want water on your board but

1150
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:53,880
you don't want

1151
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:56,079
oil what happens is the water on the

1152
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:59,359
board is going to loosen up Harden food

1153
00:47:56,079 --> 00:48:01,960
Harden this juices from things that are

1154
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:03,240
in there it's going to harden it's what

1155
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:05,119
it's going to do is it's going to soften

1156
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:06,520
up the wood and it's going to loosen up

1157
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:08,880
the hardened things that are on your

1158
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:12,240
board and then you take off the hardened

1159
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:16,160
stuff you do your sponge

1160
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:18,480
right you can get some more water on

1161
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:22,240
here and get it on here but what happens

1162
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:24,839
is the wood swells and the

1163
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:28,200
antimicrobials come out of the wood

1164
00:48:24,839 --> 00:48:29,960
antimicrobial are naturally inside this

1165
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:32,880
wood

1166
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:35,680
forever you can have a cutting board

1167
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:38,559
that's 30 years old 40 years old in your

1168
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:41,200
family line and that wood will still

1169
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:43,359
have antimicrobials in here forever

1170
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:46,160
sitting in here but you can't access

1171
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:48,319
them cuz you ain't got the key if you're

1172
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:51,760
putting oil all over your board you'll

1173
00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:55,079
never access them it's never going to

1174
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:58,119
happen you keep your boards wet with oil

1175
00:48:55,079 --> 00:48:59,880
you're never never going to access the

1176
00:48:58,119 --> 00:49:01,280
antimicrobials they're not going to come

1177
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:03,599
out and

1178
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:06,040
play when you keep that board dry and

1179
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:08,160
clean and you put water in that board to

1180
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:09,760
clean it what happens is and you leave

1181
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:11,839
it even if it's for a couple of minutes

1182
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:14,240
when you're cleaning a few minutes your

1183
00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:16,839
wood starts to swell when your wood

1184
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:20,280
starts to swell the

1185
00:49:16,839 --> 00:49:22,880
antimicrobials are now leeching out

1186
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:26,520
they're leeching out and they're killing

1187
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:28,599
stuff naturally killing stuff so nothing

1188
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:32,319
can live deep within the wood of the

1189
00:49:28,599 --> 00:49:32,319
board and harbor itself

1190
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:37,520
there you get your board

1191
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:45,599
clean take a hand

1192
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:45,599
towel and dry it up

1193
00:49:48,599 --> 00:49:53,680
now now say that

1194
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:55,160
wasn't say you're somebody you had raw

1195
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:57,280
chicken on your board you had beef on

1196
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:58,280
your board board you had raw fish on

1197
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:01,880
your

1198
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:05,000
board you want to clean it like this but

1199
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:05,000
then you want to do something

1200
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:10,880
else you want to bring

1201
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:17,920
in the hydrogen

1202
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:20,319
peroxide this one hasn't been opened yet

1203
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:24,319
I'm going to open it I'm going to give

1204
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:24,319
you a play bypl as I try to open

1205
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:27,440
this

1206
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:31,520
okay now we got

1207
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,680
peroxide

1208
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:40,680
peroxide won't

1209
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:44,680
destroy the wood's ability to release

1210
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:47,680
antimicrobials keep that in mind bleach

1211
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:50,079
will you don't want to use bleach or

1212
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:50,920
toxic cleaners especially bleach on top

1213
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:54,160
of your

1214
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:57,119
boards bleach will destroy your natural

1215
00:50:54,160 --> 00:51:00,000
anti microb Rials that lie within the

1216
00:50:57,119 --> 00:51:04,240
wood surface and deep within the wood of

1217
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:07,240
the tree a tree will have a lifetime of

1218
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:10,559
antimicrobials built into it that will

1219
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:14,559
seep out right peroxide won't destroy

1220
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:14,559
that so you put your peroxide on the

1221
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:20,240
board you can take your sponge that's

1222
00:51:17,799 --> 00:51:22,160
designated for your board and you can

1223
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:23,799
move that peroxide around your board

1224
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:27,599
just like

1225
00:51:23,799 --> 00:51:30,880
this and you can start making sure you

1226
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:32,799
kill that chicken salmonella that eoli

1227
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:35,200
from the beef and

1228
00:51:32,799 --> 00:51:38,040
whatever you want to get that peroxide

1229
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:41,559

should watch this live a bunch of times

1239
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:18,400
because it might go in one ear

1240
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:19,760
right and might go out the other ear by

1241
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:21,160

done done that's

1252
00:52:47,079 --> 00:52:53,040
it your wood will swell the

1253
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:54,640
antimicrobials will come out strong used

1254
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:57,240
a little bit of peroxide on there

1255
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:57,240
amazing

1256
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:02,599
Natasha says thank you so so so much for

1257
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:04,599
this information wow wow wow

1258
00:53:02,599 --> 00:53:07,000
wow all

1259
00:53:04,599 --> 00:53:09,680
right so I want to go into a little bit

1260
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:12,400
more of some other things say you do you

1261
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:13,559
can't afford another cutting board you

1262
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:15,640
don't have the money you don't have the

1263
00:53:13,559 --> 00:53:18,359
budget but your cutting board has mold

1264
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:20,160
on it you can see the mold on it what

1265
00:53:18,359 --> 00:53:22,079
happens is that with a lot of people the

1266
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:24,160
mold usually starts on the other side of

1267
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:26,480
the board like this the back of the

1268
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:28,520
board you have to have that towel

1269
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:29,760
underneath your board because the juices

1270
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:32,160
of whatever you're doing are going to

1271
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:34,839
most likely end up soak falling down

1272
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:36,640
here and soaking underneath the board in

1273
00:53:34,839 --> 00:53:39,319
the counter and it's going to sit there

1274
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:42,520
and fester and it's going to soak itself

1275
00:53:39,319 --> 00:53:45,680
back into the board

1276
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:48,079
right and you don't want to do that you

1277
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:50,640
want to have that Bo that that towel and

1278
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:54,160
then you want to change that towel every

1279
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:56,160
like week or 4 days or 5 days you want

1280
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:58,599
to change the towel flip it out get a

1281
00:53:56,160 --> 00:54:02,079
new towel down put your board down I got

1282
00:53:58,599 --> 00:54:02,079
to check the crinkle cut fries hold

1283
00:54:02,119 --> 00:54:09,599
on nice sprinkle cut fries are in the

1284
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:11,440
works I might even pump this up a little

1285
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:14,200
bit remember that question you had

1286
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:18,280
before like what do you want your oven

1287
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:19,599
at I said 375 to 4 and A4 I'm playing

1288
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:22,280
with 4 and a qu right now I'm playing

1289
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:23,240
with fire I got the crinkle cut fries

1290
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:26,160
going in

1291
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:27,480
there okay I'm trying to remember is

1292
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:30,400
there anything else about the cutting

1293
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:32,359
boards I want to tell you on this show I

1294
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:36,599
think there can be there are a couple of

1295
00:54:32,359 --> 00:54:38,880
things okay oh yeah there

1296
00:54:36,599 --> 00:54:41,880
is

1297
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:45,000
duh

1298
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:49,400
okay when you oil your

1299
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:53,000
boards you end up splintering your

1300
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:56,000
wood last thing you need is splinters

1301
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:58,200
you can't really see going in a family

1302
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:01,720
member's throat and getting stuck in

1303
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:03,640
there does it happen yeah it does ever

1304
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:05,480
hear of somebody having a a something

1305
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:07,599
going on with their

1306
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:11,119
throat

1307
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:13,280
right it can happen little splinters can

1308
00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:15,200
get in places we can swallow the wood

1309
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:17,520
splinters they can get hung up and

1310
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:20,960
jammed into the intestinal tract lining

1311
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:22,799
for a year and just sit there the lining

1312
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:25,440
and then the the intestinal tract just

1313
00:55:22,799 --> 00:55:26,839
calluses over it eventually and it

1314
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:30,039
becomes a

1315
00:55:26,839 --> 00:55:33,160
pup in the intestinal

1316
00:55:30,039 --> 00:55:36,160
tract the point is the oilbased

1317
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:37,440
surfaces eventually weaken the wood to

1318
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:41,039
such a

1319
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:42,680
point where it splinters so much easier

1320
00:55:41,039 --> 00:55:44,319
when you're cutting and chopping so keep

1321
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:47,200
that in mind you'll end up splintering

1322
00:55:44,319 --> 00:55:47,200
without even seeing

1323
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:54,000
it let's see here's a question over in

1324
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:55,680
IG can you run it under the water in the

1325
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:58,480
sink

1326
00:55:55,680 --> 00:56:00,200
two if the board is smaller or it's

1327
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:02,079
better to just wait you can run it you

1328
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:04,400
can run it under sink you can run it

1329
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:05,640
under the sink if you can or want to

1330
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:08,960
just make sure the other side of the

1331
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:11,200
board is dry before you place the board

1332
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:12,720
down on your counter on that towel on

1333
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:14,799
your

1334
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:16,359
counter here's something very important

1335
00:56:14,799 --> 00:56:17,799
about the cutting boards another tip I

1336
00:56:16,359 --> 00:56:20,039
think I should say is the reason why you

1337
00:56:17,799 --> 00:56:22,319
want to towel towel underneath your

1338
00:56:20,039 --> 00:56:24,960
board too you don't want your board

1339
00:56:22,319 --> 00:56:26,960
sliding so when you're cutting fruits

1340
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:28,720
and vegetables and meat and poultry or

1341
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:30,720
whatever you're cutting and chopping up

1342
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:32,640
you don't want the board accidentally

1343
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:34,559
moving on you and you cut your wrist cut

1344
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:37,359
your hand cut your

1345
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:39,480
finger so why I like the towel a nice

1346
00:56:37,359 --> 00:56:40,720
towel underneath the board that's one

1347
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:43,280
thing that's really important too people

1348
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:43,280
don't know

1349
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:49,599
that your board's going to get less

1350
00:56:47,839 --> 00:56:51,599
damage by the way in last longer if you

1351
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:53,079
don't oil it it's the opposite to what

1352
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:54,880
they say so they say your board will

1353
00:56:53,079 --> 00:56:57,680
last forever if you oil it but your

1354
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:59,839
board will actually weaken go moldy

1355
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:02,200
become problematic become a bacterial

1356
00:56:59,839 --> 00:57:02,200
ridden

1357
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:08,400
board and it'll start to wear out too

1358
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:08,400
faster than it

1359
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:15,280
should did you ever hear of a

1360
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:17,079
tree that's in a

1361
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:19,440
river

1362
00:57:17,079 --> 00:57:23,799
underwater and it's

1363
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:25,319
petrified did you ever hear about a tree

1364
00:57:23,799 --> 00:57:27,480
that

1365
00:57:25,319 --> 00:57:30,240
and I wasn't even thinking of this like

1366
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:33,480
so is giving me this right now you ever

1367
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:34,599
you ever hear about a tree that falls

1368
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:36,720
into a

1369
00:57:34,599 --> 00:57:41,160
lake and it's

1370
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:45,839
underwater it's in the mud and the

1371
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:48,079
water and it comes out of that Lake it's

1372
00:57:45,839 --> 00:57:51,920
petrified or it can be

1373
00:57:48,079 --> 00:57:53,440
used all the same as if it was cut down

1374
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:56,559
literally the

1375
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:59,480
1865 they cut cut it down it was logged

1376
00:57:56,559 --> 00:58:02,000
it got away it went down under the water

1377
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:03,720
it it lost track with all the other logs

1378
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,480
right and you pull that out do you guys

1379
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:08,119
know how this stuff works with wood and

1380
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:12,359
you pull that you can pull that oak tree

1381
00:58:08,119 --> 00:58:14,640
out of the freaking River and pl it and

1382
00:58:12,359 --> 00:58:14,640
cut

1383
00:58:15,799 --> 00:58:18,799
it

1384
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:23,720
yeah it was

1385
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:29,000
water it was in the

1386
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:29,000
water not in the oil it wasn't in the

1387
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:36,160
oil so why do I prefer wood over plastic

1388
00:58:34,599 --> 00:58:37,039
well plastic I don't like all the little

1389
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:39,960
plastic

1390
00:58:37,039 --> 00:58:42,280
fibers they they peel off the board you

1391
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:43,799
chop it up you got plastic little pieces

1392
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:45,039
you can't see are everywhere and you

1393
00:58:43,799 --> 00:58:47,039
know the whole plastic thing I won't

1394
00:58:45,039 --> 00:58:48,400
give you guys a lecture on plastic you

1395
00:58:47,039 --> 00:58:50,079
can read the medical me books I have

1396
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:51,520
lots of information about Plastics and

1397
00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:54,280
medical me

1398
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:57,960
books right and when it comes down to

1399
00:58:54,280 --> 00:59:01,799
the plastic boards you'll have a higher

1400
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:04,200
bacteria range Pro procreating on your

1401
00:59:01,799 --> 00:59:07,079
boards it's something you don't want I

1402
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:08,760
prefer wood over plastic and even glass

1403
00:59:07,079 --> 00:59:11,400
now glass I don't like because you don't

1404
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:15,240
know it but the glass

1405
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:16,680
shards are flaking they're flaking so

1406
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:18,720
here's what they do with glass so the

1407
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:20,319
glass cutting boards is they put a layer

1408
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:23,160
of plastic on your glass cutting board

1409
00:59:20,319 --> 00:59:25,720
you guys know that there's a layer of

1410
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:27,599
plastic you can never see like Plexi

1411
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:31,119
like plexiglass over your glass cutting

1412
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:32,839
board over the glass you can't see it

1413
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:34,599
that's supposed to give that coating for

1414
00:59:32,839 --> 00:59:36,400
you that chemical based coating while

1415
00:59:34,599 --> 00:59:38,480
you're cooking and chopping and you're

1416
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:40,799
on your glass and all that eventually

1417
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:44,359
you'll be eating all that

1418
00:59:40,799 --> 00:59:46,400
plexiglass plastic crap petroleum based

1419
00:59:44,359 --> 00:59:48,559
product that they laced on your glass

1420
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:50,119
cutting board you'll be eating that with

1421
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:52,559
your sandwiches you'll be eating out

1422
00:59:50,119 --> 00:59:54,760
with your food and then when that wears

1423
00:59:52,559 --> 00:59:56,880
off guess what you guys you'll be eating

1424
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:58,359
glass chips not chips like the kind of

1425
00:59:56,880 --> 01:00:00,000
chip where you chip a glass and it's a

1426
00:59:58,359 --> 01:00:02,200
big chip and you see the chip fly or you

1427
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,520
see you get cut on a little sharp chck

1428
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:06,400
no when you use glass cutting boards you

1429
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:09,240
won't see it but they actually temper

1430
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:11,359
the glass so it doesn't shatter the same

1431
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:12,960
so what happens is little micr flakes of

1432
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:14,920
glass come off the glass cutting board

1433
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:17,520
that you can't see it's wear and tear

1434
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:19,440
that you can't see little tiny bits and

1435
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:21,440
you eat it you eat it you long before

1436
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:23,000
you won't even know it 10 years later

1437
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:24,359
you might start seeing something weird

1438
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:27,480
with your glass cutting board and you're

1439
01:00:24,359 --> 01:00:31,559
like I just ate all that stuff for

1440
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:31,559
years Uma so

1441
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:37,200
live all right those french fries are

1442
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:39,520
are

1443
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:41,240
cooking okay I think I can start making

1444
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:42,640
food you guys there's more information

1445
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:46,119
about cutting boards I can give you guys

1446
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:48,559
and provide you guys there is we'll be

1447
01:00:46,119 --> 01:00:51,119
here all day that's okay that's okay I

1448
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:54,880
wouldn't I'd rather be here all day than

1449
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:57,720
anywhere else and that's a fact Jack I'm

1450
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:57,720
going to put the cutting board

1451
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:03,200
down all right as long as I'm

1452
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:07,599
permitted

1453
01:01:05,559 --> 01:01:08,880
okay so I think what I'm going to do

1454
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:11,480
while those french fries those crinkle

1455
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:12,799
cut fries are kicking ass in the oven I

1456
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:14,319
think what I'm going to do is I'm going

1457
01:01:12,799 --> 01:01:16,200
to start making I'm going to start

1458
01:01:14,319 --> 01:01:18,599
chopping up an onion that's going to go

1459
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:22,480

1462
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:28,280

1463
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:32,240
these in

1464
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:35,000
here recipe calls for a tablespoon or so

1465
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:37,160
I'm going to mix this Millet in right

1466
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:38,880
here with these

1467
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:42,760

1468
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:42,760
flakes I'm going to chop up an

1469
01:01:44,039 --> 01:01:48,000
onion okay I'm going to crank up the

1470
01:01:46,319 --> 01:01:50,880
heat on this a little bit I'm going to

1471
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:52,559
add a little touch of

1472
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:54,200
water and I'm going to show you the

1473
01:01:52,559 --> 01:01:58,279
recipe in the book here little touch of

1474
01:01:54,200 --> 01:02:00,200
water in my Millet with the heat up says

1475
01:01:58,279 --> 01:02:02,480
that in the book I think and

1476
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:03,520
then this is the recipe we're making

1477
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:04,720
look at that check this out but it's

1478
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:06,440
going to look a little different today

1479
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:08,720
because I got an assortment of leafy

1480
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:10,240
greens instead of iceberg lettuce I

1481
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:12,279
couldn't find a good iceberg lettuce in

1482
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:14,520
the store could not find one for the

1483
01:02:12,279 --> 01:02:16,760
life of me sometimes they're really

1484
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:19,319
solid you just know you got a good one

1485
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:21,640
right but then it wasn't there though it

1486
01:02:19,319 --> 01:02:23,520

1487
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:25,839

Evelyn says is it true that when you cut

1572
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:35,760
garlic wait 10 minutes before putting it

1573
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:35,760
in your food so it can release all its

1574
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:44,200

but we're we're getting

1920
01:24:32,639 --> 01:24:39,840
there okay onig some people

1921
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:45,360
believe of the sulfur of garlic and

1922
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:45,360
onions cause bloating in gas is that

1923
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:54,360
true the sulfur and garlic and onions do

1924
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:54,360
not cause um bloating in gas

1925
01:24:55,520 --> 01:25:03,199
garlic kills a lot of yeast and

1926
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:07,360
mold and a lot of unproductive

1927
01:25:03,199 --> 01:25:10,480
fungus garlic kills a lot of microbes

1928
01:25:07,360 --> 01:25:13,639
garlic kills bad

1929
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:16,000
bacteria and when you send raw garlic

1930
01:25:13,639 --> 01:25:17,119
down and you're filled you're like

1931
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:19,920
you're

1932
01:25:17,119 --> 01:25:21,480
overfilled or you got a pocket or two

1933
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:24,560
maybe a pocket or two that you haven't

1934
01:25:21,480 --> 01:25:27,760
tapped into in inside your gut that

1935
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:27,760
garlic is going

1936
01:25:28,840 --> 01:25:35,560
to Boom blow it up and all it takes is

1937
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:39,600
one microbe

1938
01:25:35,560 --> 01:25:43,920
dying and that can give you some gas

1939
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:46,119
just one microbe dying can give you

1940
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:47,480
gas but it's not the sulfur that's

1941
01:25:46,119 --> 01:25:49,760
giving people

1942
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:52,800
gas plus it's

1943
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:55,040
hell like hot spicy

1944
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:56,960

1945
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:59,320

01:28:31,639 --> 01:28:34,320
the same time you guys and they mix it

2004
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,239
up a little bit with their junk that

2005
01:28:34,320 --> 01:28:37,400
they're

2006
01:28:35,239 --> 01:28:39,080
selling they talk about binders or

2007
01:28:37,400 --> 01:28:41,800
whatever whatever they just try to mess

2008
01:28:39,080 --> 01:28:44,800
up people's heads and that's how it

2009
01:28:41,800 --> 01:28:44,800
works

2010
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,719
yeah

2011
01:28:52,520 --> 01:28:55,920
all right just cooking these a little

2012
01:28:53,719 --> 01:28:59,080
bit longer what it is is I'm using this

2013
01:28:55,920 --> 01:29:00,639
burner instead of the burner here so I

2014
01:28:59,080 --> 01:29:02,800
might do that I actually might flip it

2015
01:29:00,639 --> 01:29:05,440
onto this burner so I can get equal heat

2016
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:05,440
everywhere on

2017
01:29:05,560 --> 01:29:09,440
there so that's what I'm going to do I'm

2018
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:13,600
going to flip this pan to the

2019
01:29:09,440 --> 01:29:13,600

2026
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:43,040

stores yeah this is

2126
01:34:56,960 --> 01:34:59,960
Stefan

2127
01:35:02,960 --> 01:35:09,440
yeah yes the sponsored ad was

2128
01:35:06,880 --> 01:35:11,199
marketed yep to another person stuff

2129
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:12,880
yeah well that's what you know what

2130
01:35:11,199 --> 01:35:15,159
happens is what they'll do is they'll

2131
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:17,040
they'll they're look the medical medum

2132
01:35:15,159 --> 01:35:19,119
community is unlike anything else out

2133
01:35:17,040 --> 01:35:21,000
there it doesn't you have to understand

2134
01:35:19,119 --> 01:35:23,199
you guys there's no Community out there

2135
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:25,360
that exist exists like this community

2136
01:35:23,199 --> 01:35:27,239
there just isn't because there isn't a

2137
01:35:25,360 --> 01:35:29,679
community out there where that many

2138
01:35:27,239 --> 01:35:31,560
people healed or are healing like that

2139
01:35:29,679 --> 01:35:33,159
are really sick like chronically ill

2140
01:35:31,560 --> 01:35:36,040
that doesn't exist out

2141
01:35:33,159 --> 01:35:38,760
there and so because that doesn't exist

2142
01:35:36,040 --> 01:35:40,639
this is the prime location though

2143
01:35:38,760 --> 01:35:43,040
because the medical Med Community is a

2144
01:35:40,639 --> 01:35:44,840
large community and it's and it's

2145
01:35:43,040 --> 01:35:47,000
getting new people in all the time that

2146
01:35:44,840 --> 01:35:48,080
are kind of like scared sitting on

2147
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,719
sitting on the fence they've been

2148
01:35:48,080 --> 01:35:51,520
through hell out there and they're just

2149
01:35:49,719 --> 01:35:53,000
starting to get their sea legs and

2150
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:54,560
they're just starting to come around

2151
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,880
where they're like you know they've been

2152
01:35:54,560 --> 01:35:58,560
through so much and then it's the

2153
01:35:55,880 --> 01:36:01,000
perfect place to shoot propaganda at

2154
01:35:58,560 --> 01:36:02,400
them to lead them astray so then they

2155
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:05,199
get confused like I just started

2156
01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:07,080
