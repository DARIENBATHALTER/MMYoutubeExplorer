1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
It's at the end of the night. I just

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:06,400
came back from Cafe Gratitude night one

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,480
of the popup dinners, the pizza party.

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,639
And I got my pizza right here, which is

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,040
actually amazing. I got more than one

6
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:15,679
pizza, though, cuz you know, I might be

7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:18,720
eating them different times. This one is

8
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:20,080
the Mediterranean Putin. This is

9
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,400
amazing. I'm just going to take a bite.

10
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,400
Can't help

11
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:27,000
it. Oh, that's insane. All right, let me

12
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:31,119
see what else I

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,119
got. Another one here.

14
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,960
Okay. So, oh

15
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:40,960
yeah, right here it's the veggie medley

16
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:43,960
with the uh broccolini and then the um

17
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:46,960
potato cheese. This is really

18
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,960
good.

19
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,680
Mhm. That's

20
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:55,680
insane. That's

21
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:58,879
insane. So good. But here's the thing. I

22
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:01,280
even got a couple more

23
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:03,400
There's one right here. It's probably

24
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:06,920
one of the other ones. Obviously, there

25
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:10,240
is. Wow. And then I got one

26
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:13,560
more. So, am I going to eat all four of

27
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:17,840
these tonight? No, I don't think so.

28
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:20,000
But I am going to eat definitely one of

29
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,000
them for sure. Maybe I'll eat one and a

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
half cuz I really didn't eat anything

31
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,759
today. You know, I just been so busy.

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,119
Didn't eat much. just spending on a

33
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,439
little bit of coconut water and some

34
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,200
other stuff. So, but now I'm hungry. So,

35
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:33,680
at the end of the day, I'm going to eat

36
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,200
you guys. And um I'm so excited about

37
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,960
this. This is a collaboration medical

38
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,920
medium and Cafe Gratitude with pizzas.

39
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:42,560
Unbelievable. The first pizza

40
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,320

41
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,320

00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:48,720
here.

43
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:51,600
And and they're delicious. These are

44
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:54,079
worth flying out of the country, flying

45
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:57,200
from another country to here to actually

46
00:01:54,079 --> 00:02:00,159
just taste these. They're that great.

47
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,399
Oh, by the way, the crust, chickpea,

48
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:05,280
potato, and sweet potato. How about that

49
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,759
for a crust? That's unique. That's

50
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,280
amazing. Medical meme pizzas. Cafe

51
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,720

54
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:17,120
