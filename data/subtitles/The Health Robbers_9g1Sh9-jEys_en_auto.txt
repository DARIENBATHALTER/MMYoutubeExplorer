[249.04 - 252.96] of protecting the chronic leo we're not

[252.96 - 256.00] alternative health industries not
[255.36 - 259.60] they're
[256.00 - 261.76] also the thieves the robbers of health
[259.60 - 262.96] yeah you may not think so you may not
[261.76 - 264.80] think so you
[262.96 - 266.48] you left a conventional diet you left
[264.80 - 268.24] the standard american diet
[266.48 - 270.00] you got some high blood pressure got
[268.24 - 272.00] some high cholesterol maybe you got a
[270.00 - 272.56] skin condition maybe something happened
[272.00 - 274.16] where you
[272.56 - 275.76] you left the conventional world of
[274.16 - 277.68] health and then you
[275.76 - 279.44] joined in in the alternative you found a
[277.68 - 282.00] good guy found a good
[279.44 - 283.84] you know gal in the industry you're
[282.00 - 285.84] getting help from a practitioner they
[283.84 - 287.52] got you off of bad food
[285.84 - 289.12] they got you off of that i mean they may
[287.52 - 291.12] not have known it was bad food
[289.12 - 293.04] without medical medium doing 35 years of
[291.12 - 295.20] getting it out there and out there
[293.04 - 296.08] but they took the office some bad food
[295.20 - 298.08] right
[296.08 - 299.68] you're exercising more you're on your
[298.08 - 301.20] keto diet
[299.68 - 302.72] which isn't keto because there's no such
[301.20 - 304.24] thing as a keto diet anymore
[302.72 - 306.88] there's no such thing you can't go into
[304.24 - 308.64] ketosis you can't because they let
[306.88 - 310.56] sugar into the keto diet so they call it
[308.64 - 313.12] keto no one realizes that all is just a
[310.56 - 315.12] clean animal protein diet is all it is
[313.12 - 316.24] or a plant-based diet they call keto but
[315.12 - 318.88] all it is just
[316.24 - 320.88] lots of fat in your plant-based diet but
[318.88 - 322.32] there's also sugar everywhere nuts have
[320.88 - 324.00] sugar in it
[322.32 - 326.16] avocado has sugar in it you can't go
[324.00 - 328.16] into ketosis your body can't go into
[326.16 - 330.32] ketosis when you eat an avocado because
[328.16 - 332.40] an avocado is part sugar
[330.32 - 334.16] part sugar you can only go to keto you
[332.40 - 335.92] can only go to ketosis
[334.16 - 337.76] the body going literally into ketosis
[335.92 - 340.16] michelle miller are going to
[337.76 - 342.40] smoking mountain paradise you can only
[340.16 - 344.72] only go into ketosis
[342.40 - 346.88] if no sugar is in there no sugar
[344.72 - 349.04] anywhere right no sugar
[346.88 - 351.12] and guess what when you go into when you
[349.04 - 353.68] go into ketosis and you're on a no
[351.12 - 354.56] carb no sugar diet whatsoever no fruit
[353.68 - 357.60] no nothing
[354.56 - 360.72] you go downhill fast
[357.60 - 362.32] boom because guess what i watched people
[360.72 - 364.64] die
[362.32 - 366.48] years and years ago that try to put
[364.64 - 367.76] themselves in ketosis
[366.48 - 369.36] stupidest thing on the planet you know
[367.76 - 370.88] why the keto diet is not the keto diet
[369.36 - 372.32] anymore
[370.88 - 374.16] if they call it a keto diet but it's not
[372.32 - 376.00] the keto diet you can't go into ketosis
[374.16 - 377.84] because there's sugar in it everywhere
[376.00 - 379.92] they let you have a green apple can't go
[377.84 - 381.36] into ketosis one green apple a day you
[379.92 - 384.16] can't go into ketosis
[381.36 - 386.32] you can't they can't you can't one
[384.16 - 387.52] avocado a day you can't go into ketosis
[386.32 - 391.12] it's impossible
[387.52 - 393.28] because there's sugar and avocado right
[391.12 - 394.80] see how it works ashley kevin good to
[393.28 - 398.16] see you
[394.80 - 399.52] so we live in this false world of health
[398.16 - 401.12] the information isn't just
[399.52 - 402.80] misinformation anymore that's a medical
[401.12 - 404.08] medium term by the way
[402.80 - 405.76] medical medium didn't create the word
[404.08 - 407.36] misinformation that was long before my
[405.76 - 410.48] time
[407.36 - 413.12] but medical medium put misinformation
[410.48 - 414.56] the word in every single thing saying
[413.12 - 416.24] look that's misinformation out there you
[414.56 - 418.32] guys that's misinformation now
[416.24 - 420.56] now people are saying misinformation out
[418.32 - 422.72] there but it's gone beyond that
[420.56 - 424.32] it's not it's beyond this information
[422.72 - 426.80] now okay
[424.32 - 427.52] it's beyond it is that a place where
[426.80 - 431.12] it's just
[427.52 - 432.56] screwed up it's just totally screwed up
[431.12 - 433.44] so yeah i'm gonna go on the keto diet
[432.56 - 434.80] really what you're doing is you're
[433.44 - 436.08] getting rid of fast foods getting rid of
[434.80 - 437.60] greasy foods getting rid of processed
[436.08 - 438.72] foods you're starting to exercise more
[437.60 - 440.16] you're taking a bunch of garbage

[440.16 - 443.68] in there and you get it in your system
[441.92 - 447.12] and then you think you found the holy
[443.68 - 449.68] grail which you just found all you found
[447.12 - 451.04] was your future pea cup at the doctor's
[449.68 - 452.64] office

[512.24 - 517.20] has your back
[513.44 - 520.24] or or am i wrong okay

[522.32 - 526.08] that's not having your back
[524.08 - 527.60] it's not the practitioner's fault of the
[526.08 - 528.80] doctor's fault here's your whey protein
[527.60 - 530.96] powder that's going to get you
[528.80 - 532.00] sick because the bugs in you that got
[530.96 - 533.52] you sick

[549.52 - 553.92] and let you know basically land up real
[552.24 - 557.68] sick
[553.92 - 561.52] okay and classified research and science
[557.68 - 564.40] raised all the bugs that we have now
[561.52 - 566.56] and then it took doctors to to find them
[564.40 - 568.72] by accident did you guys know that
[566.56 - 569.84] did you guys know that did you know
[568.72 - 573.12] epsilon bar

[591.68 - 594.56] cause of mystery brain inflammation for
[593.84 - 597.60] most
[594.56 - 598.80] cases usually my epstein-barr virus did
[597.60 - 602.84] you know the epstein-barr
[598.80 - 606.72] virus right was discovered in the 60s
[602.84 - 609.76] 1960s right like dr epstein dr barr
[606.72 - 612.72] okay and did you know
[609.76 - 614.32] those guys that was the public medical
[612.72 - 617.92] research and science
[614.32 - 620.32] those were public medical research and
[617.92 - 623.52] science virologists
[620.32 - 626.40] they weren't the classified
[623.52 - 627.36] medical research and science virologists
[626.40 - 630.16] the ones
[627.36 - 633.04] that already knew about epstein-barr
[630.16 - 636.08] before 1920
[633.04 - 637.60] before 1920.
[636.08 - 640.08] chris you seem fine to me we know this
[637.60 - 641.84] information because of anthony
[640.08 - 644.64] honor honored you're here cindy lou good
[641.84 - 647.28] to see you darcy lee good to see you
[644.64 - 648.32] so the classified medical research and
[647.28 - 650.72] science
[648.32 - 652.40] that the publicly known is not privy to
[650.72 - 653.12] you know the classified that put out
[652.40 - 655.04] that plague
[653.12 - 656.40] right the classified that's out there it
[655.04 - 659.76] puts out every single
[656.40 - 662.16] plague every single all the viruses
[659.76 - 664.96] they already put out f steam bar virus
[662.16 - 668.08] they already sent it out
[664.96 - 670.24] they already sent it out before 1920
[668.08 - 671.84] and then it sat around that virus got
[670.24 - 673.60] people sick it spread it spread the
[671.84 - 675.36] epstein-barr spread it mutated more
[673.60 - 675.68] varieties came out of it more varieties
[675.36 - 678.08] came
[675.68 - 678.08] out of it
[678.72 - 684.40] and then what happened was
[681.84 - 685.04] dr barr and dr epstein were in their lab
[684.40 - 689.28] in their
[685.04 - 691.68] public public virologists
[689.28 - 693.36] they discovered it they didn't discover
[691.68 - 695.04] it they found what was already thrown
[693.36 - 697.60] out there by classified medical research
[695.04 - 697.60] and science
[698.16 - 706.40] you know it's like just like security
[703.36 - 708.32] secrecy secrecy
[706.40 - 709.60] it's good information it is because i'll
[708.32 - 711.52] tell you why
[709.60 - 712.96] because all this time alternative
[711.52 - 714.84] medicine
[712.96 - 716.32] didn't know anything didn't know
[714.84 - 718.48] anything
[716.32 - 720.00] didn't know nothing it's try this snake
[718.48 - 721.44] oil see if you can get better
[720.00 - 723.28] try this snake oil and see if you can
[721.44 - 723.92] get better try this and see if you get
[723.28 - 725.92] better
[723.92 - 728.40] oh okay lyme disease well lyme disease
[725.92 - 730.88] in 1970s early 1970s let's just
[728.40 - 734.08] antibiotic you guys to death no one's
[730.88 - 737.92] protecting anybody
[734.08 - 739.36] so we got a wave of people that lost
[737.92 - 740.88] their lives from lyme disease not
[739.36 - 742.88] because of lyme disease not because of
[740.88 - 744.64] the real reason of lyme disease which
[742.88 - 747.92] i've seen more virus they lost their
[744.64 - 751.52] lives because
[747.92 - 755.04] they were antibiotic to death by
[751.52 - 757.92] the publicly known research in science
[755.04 - 758.56] and meanwhile the epstein-barr that's
[757.92 - 761.60] behind
[758.56 - 762.00] neurological limes was put out there by
[761.60 - 765.44] the
[762.00 - 767.76] classified medical research and science
[765.44 - 769.52] you guys get the gist of how it works
[767.76 - 772.72] out there
[769.52 - 773.60] i mean this is unbelievable information
[772.72 - 776.64] i mean
[773.60 - 778.16] boom it all comes together
[776.64 - 779.52] so we're making spinach soup we're
[778.16 - 782.08] covering different things so who's
[779.52 - 784.08] protecting you guys i want to know
[782.08 - 785.20] who's protecting you guys is it the
[784.08 - 787.12] collagen industry
[785.20 - 788.88] they protecting you guys because i'm
[787.12 - 792.08] scratching my head on that one
[788.88 - 793.28] is it that because medical research and
[792.08 - 796.72] science
[793.28 - 798.24] okay both alternative and conventional
[796.72 - 801.28] they don't know why anybody's sick but i
[798.24 - 803.44] love how billions of dollars go into the
[801.28 - 807.04] stupidest crap like the collagen
[803.44 - 808.56] right so is that protecting you the
[807.04 - 811.76] collagen powder
[808.56 - 813.84] it can't it's not you can't eat collagen
[811.76 - 815.60] and create collagen that's original
[813.84 - 817.12] medical meme information guess what
[815.60 - 818.48] now there's a couple of products out
[817.12 - 819.60] there where they take like a little bit
[818.48 - 820.96] of this and a little bit of that a
[819.60 - 822.16] little bit of nettle or a little bit of
[820.96 - 822.56] something else they put it together and
[822.16 - 824.16] they say
[822.56 - 826.56] and now they say medical medium
[824.16 - 828.88] information supplement companies
[826.56 - 829.84] and they say oh yeah you can't you can't
[828.88 - 832.00] create
[829.84 - 833.92] collagen you have to build it you need
[832.00 - 836.32] the building blocks you need plant food
[833.92 - 839.52] building blocks that's original mm info
[836.32 - 841.12] once again taken so there's two kinds of
[839.52 - 844.00] thieves out there
[841.12 - 845.60] there's the industry that's a thief they
[844.00 - 847.84] steal your health
[845.60 - 849.68] they steal it they steal it and they rob
[847.84 - 850.00] it that's what they do you don't believe
[849.68 - 853.84] me
[850.00 - 855.12] fine fine am i pissing you off five five
[853.84 - 857.60] you don't want to watch this fine i
[855.12 - 859.12] don't say right
[857.60 - 860.80] because oh no he doesn't know what he's
[859.12 - 862.72] talking about i go to my practitioner i
[860.80 - 864.56] got my practitioner i get all the things
[862.72 - 868.16] i need i'm feeling better because i'm
[864.56 - 870.16] keeping out the bad food um exercising a
[868.16 - 871.36] little more
[870.16 - 872.64] you know there's a lot of people they
[871.36 - 873.44] just they haven't been there they
[872.64 - 875.44] haven't been
[873.44 - 877.60] sick enough to actually know that
[875.44 - 880.56] they've been duped they've been duped
[877.60 - 881.20] renee says also confusing is my blood
[880.56 - 885.20] work
[881.20 - 887.52] showed reactivated but my pcr test is
[885.20 - 890.24] completely negative
[887.52 - 891.76] i'm now at a loss i just spent over five
[890.24 - 894.24] thousand dollars to find out why
[891.76 - 895.20] i was running a temperature every
[894.24 - 897.28] afternoon
[895.20 - 899.04] feeling awful and sweating through my
[897.28 - 903.20] clothes at night
[899.04 - 905.68] it's been a year marginally better
[903.20 - 907.20] but i still have this mystery illness my
[905.68 - 908.16] doctor is clueless renee that's how it
[907.20 - 910.40] works out there
[908.16 - 912.32] that's how it works take the book to
[910.40 - 915.68] your doctor
[912.32 - 917.04] okay take the book to your doctor
[915.68 - 918.96] ask your doctor if it's okay to do
[917.04 - 922.88] things in here
[918.96 - 924.16] and get it fixed get it fixed
[922.88 - 926.80] the whole reason why these books are
[924.16 - 927.84] here reactivated epsilon bar is medical
[926.80 - 929.68] medium information
[927.84 - 931.04] doctors never took they never tested for
[929.68 - 932.16] reactivated epstein-barr
[931.04 - 935.28] until medical medium books were
[932.16 - 937.68] published so it is
[935.28 - 940.32] mm info if your doctor's even checking
[937.68 - 943.28] are testing for reactivated epstein-barr
[940.32 - 943.28] it's mm info
[943.44 - 947.04] and reactivated epsom bar is not even
[945.60 - 948.56] easy to even find
[947.04 - 950.24] because there's over 60 varieties of
[948.56 - 952.56] epstein-barr and that's the whole thing
[950.24 - 954.16] people don't have the answers they don't
[952.56 - 956.24] have the information
[954.16 - 957.84] the medical system doesn't and you learn
[956.24 - 961.92] that when you're really sick
[957.84 - 961.92] there's a way to heal it's a way to heal
[964.32 - 969.92] okay and
[968.56 - 971.28] now they didn't even know epsilon bar
[969.92 - 972.72] has anything to do with anybody being
[971.28 - 974.16] sick they thought it gave you tiredness
[972.72 - 974.64] and malaise when you had mono and that
[974.16 - 978.24] was it
[974.64 - 980.40] gone forever and
[978.24 - 982.00] and then they they thought epsilon bar
[980.40 - 984.00] only was one virus
[982.00 - 985.68] medical medium put out that there's over
[984.00 - 988.40] 60 varieties of epstein-barr
[985.68 - 989.84] right you guys now guess what science
[988.40 - 991.44] research
[989.84 - 993.12] publicly known science and research is
[991.44 - 994.56] now saying there's two varieties of
[993.12 - 997.76] epstein-barr
[994.56 - 998.08] two varieties of epsom bar important you
[997.76 - 1001.36] know
[998.08 - 1004.64] medical medium is always on track
[1001.36 - 1006.16] it has a record of it it's the only
[1004.64 - 1008.56] published information that said there's
[1006.16 - 1011.12] more than one epstein-barr virus
[1008.56 - 1012.40] nowhere else in the world has it existed
[1011.12 - 1014.16] i taught this for years and i've
[1012.40 - 1016.08] published it too
[1014.16 - 1018.80] now i've seen now science research is
[1016.08 - 1022.84] saying there's two varieties
[1018.80 - 1024.16] did they yet learn about the other 58
[1022.84 - 1027.60] varieties
[1024.16 - 1029.04] because there's over 60 varieties so
[1027.60 - 1030.80] it's already been published first
[1029.04 - 1034.80] important enough
[1030.80 - 1038.00] if you're new here that's a major deal
[1034.80 - 1039.28] that's a major major amazing thing you
[1038.00 - 1040.64] mean to tell me he knew there's more
[1039.28 - 1041.92] than one variety of episode bar the
[1040.64 - 1043.52] science of research is talking about it
[1041.92 - 1046.32] years later
[1043.52 - 1048.32] and then neurological fatigue fatigue
[1046.32 - 1050.24] that's a that's in medical medium term
[1048.32 - 1052.88] neurological fatigue
[1050.24 - 1053.92] no one knew that it's neurological the
[1052.88 - 1056.48] fatigue
[1053.92 - 1059.04] just thought you're tired and then they
[1056.48 - 1061.60] thought it's your adrenals only
[1059.04 - 1063.44] then they thought you're crazy but
[1061.60 - 1064.24] nobody knew it's from the brain becoming
[1063.44 - 1066.40] inflamed
[1064.24 - 1067.60] it's neurological fatigue your nerves
[1066.40 - 1071.36] being inflamed
[1067.60 - 1073.92] by the epstein-barr virus
[1071.36 - 1078.16] so who's looking out for everybody
[1073.92 - 1080.72] because it's a wasteland of answers
[1078.16 - 1082.00] and now podcast doctors are stealing it
[1080.72 - 1083.28] so that's what they're doing now
[1082.00 - 1085.04] so you got two kinds of thieves out
[1083.28 - 1087.20] there you've got the thieves
[1085.04 - 1089.52] the industries that want to steal your
[1087.20 - 1091.44] health and take literally rob and steal
[1089.52 - 1092.80] your health and steal any chance you can
[1091.44 - 1094.72] heal and the alternative movement will
[1092.80 - 1096.16] join in give you all the collagen
[1094.72 - 1098.08] all the whey protein powder i'm just
[1096.16 - 1101.12] naming a few things and they'll join in
[1098.08 - 1102.96] and just show you just lose you lose
[1101.12 - 1104.72] and then there's the other thieves
[1102.96 - 1106.16] podcast doctors that take medical medium
[1104.72 - 1109.92] information
[1106.16 - 1110.88] abuse it don't cite where it comes from
[1109.92 - 1112.64] and pretend they know what they're
[1110.88 - 1114.72] talking about because they're desperate
[1112.64 - 1116.80] for something new
[1114.72 - 1118.00] right another thief and that thief
[1116.80 - 1120.88] doesn't help anybody either
[1118.00 - 1122.32] so who's got your back i want to know i
[1120.88 - 1125.44] want to know
[1122.32 - 1127.44] who's got your back so let's make some
[1125.44 - 1130.16] spinach soup right here
[1127.44 - 1130.16] good to see you guys
[1131.52 - 1135.12] once i grew up at 40 i started looking
[1133.44 - 1136.16] out for myself with your information on
[1135.12 - 1141.20] tick tock
[1136.16 - 1143.92] amazing what section is the nerve
[1141.20 - 1146.00] god's good on tick tock what section is
[1143.92 - 1147.68] the nerves
[1146.00 - 1149.36] nerve i mean it's all neurological in
[1147.68 - 1150.16] here so much neurological information
[1149.36 - 1152.16] just look up
[1150.16 - 1153.52] disease your symptom your condition or
[1152.16 - 1155.36] autoimmune
[1153.52 - 1156.64] whatever whatever you need to do just
[1155.36 - 1158.80] there's the symptoms are in there
[1156.64 - 1162.84] they're all through there all the nerds
[1158.80 - 1164.16] digest this chest tightness tingles and
[1162.84 - 1165.92] numbness
[1164.16 - 1167.84] you steal medical medium information and
[1165.92 - 1170.56] try to discredit me at the same time
[1167.84 - 1170.96] that's what they do now i don't care
[1170.56 - 1172.96] about
[1170.96 - 1174.80] the you know like the discrediting like
[1172.96 - 1177.12] my feelings don't get hurt i'm like oh
[1174.80 - 1179.20] my feelings are hurt now
[1177.12 - 1180.72] my feelings are hurt that's not it it's
[1179.20 - 1182.40] just that when you can't find your way
[1180.72 - 1183.04] to the real information to where it all
[1182.40 - 1185.68] comes from
[1183.04 - 1187.12] it hurts that's what hurts because it
[1185.68 - 1190.00] keeps people from healing
[1187.12 - 1191.76] that's the painful thorn that's in my
[1190.00 - 1192.32] side that i have to carry i have to
[1191.76 - 1194.88] carry
[1192.32 - 1196.48] a knife in my back a knife in my side i
[1194.88 - 1198.88] have to carry that every day
[1196.48 - 1200.16] it's knowing they're going to steal
[1198.88 - 1201.52] little bits and pieces
[1200.16 - 1203.28] make it look like out there in
[1201.52 - 1205.12] alternative medicine and conventional
[1203.28 - 1206.00] medicine that they have some answer or
[1205.12 - 1208.48] have you on the right
[1206.00 - 1210.64] track and then you end up like people
[1208.48 - 1213.76] i've seen
[1210.64 - 1214.88] where they never never get to the real
[1213.76 - 1218.16] source to know
[1214.88 - 1221.44] how to heal and
[1218.16 - 1222.16] that's the part that kills me because
[1221.44 - 1225.68] it's so
[1222.16 - 1227.20] unfair it's like long paul kovet being
[1225.68 - 1230.72] epstein barr
[1227.20 - 1234.48] that's medical medium information
[1230.72 - 1237.04] stolen by the podcast doctors
[1234.48 - 1237.76] low grade viral is medical medium
[1237.04 - 1240.80] information
[1237.76 - 1245.36] the terminal of great viral all of it
[1240.80 - 1248.64] lorena good to see you and

[1332.16 - 1337.84] have it's just it's endless
[1334.08 - 1341.36] endless and you know what
[1337.84 - 1343.92] we have this mechanism inside of us
[1341.36 - 1345.12] because we've been brainwashed that
[1343.92 - 1348.16] doesn't mind
[1345.12 - 1351.36] self destroying ourselves
[1348.16 - 1352.80] literally you can you can i told you
[1351.36 - 1356.00] guys last time
[1352.80 - 1357.76] right adele says coffee and chocolate
[1356.00 - 1359.92] was so hard for me to stop
[1357.76 - 1360.96] but feel so much better now guess what
[1359.92 - 1362.64] what if someone
[1360.96 - 1364.16] is really sick and they're stuck on that
[1362.64 - 1367.04] coffee and chocolate right
[1364.16 - 1368.96] to really sick i mean it'll kill them if
[1367.04 - 1370.96] they're really sick
[1368.96 - 1372.96] see they got neurological symptoms like
[1370.96 - 1374.24] bad ones and someone's like here have
[1372.96 - 1377.28] this bar of chocolate
[1374.24 - 1379.36] you can end someone's life
[1377.28 - 1380.32] if they're bad enough if they're low
[1379.36 - 1382.96] enough
[1380.32 - 1383.52] a cup of coffee so for someone who has a
[1382.96 - 1385.04] really
[1383.52 - 1386.32] neural bad neurological problem and
[1385.04 - 1387.68] they're half bedridden and they're on
[1386.32 - 1388.48] mattress island you give them a cup of
[1387.68 - 1391.52] coffee
[1388.48 - 1393.92] you might give them a seizure in their

[1448.88 - 1452.96] and they're all tricked and i can't stop
[1451.76 - 1454.72] them from pulling the pin out of the
[1452.96 - 1455.76] grenade i told you guys last time i was

[1464.00 - 1468.64] pin out and they'll pull it out anyway
[1465.92 - 1471.36] and be like what
[1468.64 - 1472.80] they'll do it anyway people are like
[1471.36 - 1474.72] they're set
[1472.80 - 1476.24] to destroy themselves because the system
[1474.72 - 1477.76] brainwashed them the system has
[1476.24 - 1479.44] conditioned them you're conditioned
[1477.76 - 1481.60] you're conditioned
[1479.44 - 1482.56] and then here's the other thing now
[1481.60 - 1484.56] we're up against
[1482.56 - 1486.08] something i never saw before the
[1484.56 - 1488.88] internet doctor
[1486.08 - 1492.08] not all of them but the internet doctor
[1488.88 - 1495.20] the internet doctor wants people sick
[1492.08 - 1496.24] i never thought i would say it all these
[1495.20 - 1498.48] years i'm like
[1496.24 - 1500.56] it's the industries it's the industries
[1498.48 - 1502.40] you guys they want you sick
[1500.56 - 1503.84] not the doctors the doctors have all
[1502.40 - 1505.84] this compassion in the world
[1503.84 - 1506.88] the doctors go into the business with
[1505.84 - 1508.96] compassion
[1506.88 - 1510.08] they want you better they go into it
[1508.96 - 1511.60] with an open heart
[1510.08 - 1513.60] even if they don't know why you're sick
[1511.60 - 1514.00] and what to do for you the doctors come
[1513.60 - 1518.08] into
[1514.00 - 1522.48] it they come into it with a good heart
[1518.08 - 1525.92] freaking wrong i'm wrong
[1522.48 - 1528.08] when do i say that i'm wrong boom i've
[1525.92 - 1530.72] been proven wrong
[1528.08 - 1531.12] been proven wrong i used to say this all
[1530.72 - 1532.64] the time
[1531.12 - 1534.32] you guys have heard it a million times
[1532.64 - 1536.16] the doctor's hearts are in it they
[1534.32 - 1536.96] become a doctor because they want you
[1536.16 - 1538.96] better
[1536.96 - 1540.40] they don't know better of what they're
[1538.96 - 1541.76] doing or what they offer they don't have
[1540.40 - 1542.56] the answers medical school's not
[1541.76 - 1544.64] teaching them
[1542.56 - 1546.48] but you have to give the doctors the
[1544.64 - 1548.64] benefit of the doubt because the doctor
[1546.48 - 1552.08] is a good person and wants you better
[1548.64 - 1552.08] i'm wrong boom wrong
[1552.40 - 1556.32] because there's a new doctor out there
[1554.72 - 1559.76] and it's the internet doctor
[1556.32 - 1561.76] and they suck they suck
[1559.76 - 1563.60] because they want people sick they
[1561.76 - 1565.44] they're paid to keep people sick
[1563.60 - 1567.04] they want people chronically ill they
[1565.44 - 1567.60] stamp them out of medical schools left
[1567.04 - 1570.32] and right
[1567.60 - 1571.20] and they don't go to work they just get
[1570.32 - 1572.72] on the internet
[1571.20 - 1575.12] and they're the young doctor that's
[1572.72 - 1575.92] coming out now it's this young line of
[1575.12 - 1577.76] doctors
[1575.92 - 1579.68] that are stamped on a medical school
[1577.76 - 1581.04] they don't want the job really and they
[1579.68 - 1582.48] don't want to work because the minute
[1581.04 - 1584.16] they worked a day in their life
[1582.48 - 1585.68] they came out of medical school and they
[1584.16 - 1586.72] started working in a practice for two
[1585.68 - 1588.96] seconds they realized
[1586.72 - 1589.92] it was just too hard everybody's sick
[1588.96 - 1591.76] nobody knows why
[1589.92 - 1593.28] and they just whoa they're so entitled
[1591.76 - 1597.28] they back up and then they get
[1593.28 - 1599.52] a job as an internet doctor and then
[1597.28 - 1601.36] they literally try to stop the
[1599.52 - 1604.24] chronically ill from
[1601.36 - 1605.92] chronically ill from healing yeah
[1604.24 - 1609.84] they're selfie doctors
[1605.92 - 1611.44] chris it's a new doctor that came out
[1609.84 - 1613.04] and you know what happens you put out
[1611.44 - 1614.56] your healing story
[1613.04 - 1616.56] and then you get a whole bunch of
[1614.56 - 1617.92] doctors going on there saying you didn't
[1616.56 - 1619.68] heal you didn't heal
[1617.92 - 1620.96] there's no signs of research to show
[1619.68 - 1621.76] back up that you got rid of your
[1620.96 - 1623.84] condition
[1621.76 - 1625.28] you're not you're you weren't sick you
[1623.84 - 1626.96] were lying you were lying
[1625.28 - 1628.80] you were faking it you were faking it
[1626.96 - 1630.88] and they're doctors
[1628.80 - 1632.00] it's weird they're like naturopaths the
[1630.88 - 1633.92] chiropractors
[1632.00 - 1636.40] they're like functional doctors they're
[1633.92 - 1637.92] mds and it's this new internet doctor
[1636.40 - 1639.84] and they don't care if you die
[1637.92 - 1641.36] they don't care if you live they don't
[1639.84 - 1643.44] care they're just like no where's the
[1641.36 - 1644.88] study where's the study try this mct oil
[1643.44 - 1645.68] where's the study you should be on a
[1644.88 - 1647.12] high fat diet
[1645.68 - 1648.40] where's the study you should be on this
[1647.12 - 1650.88] you should be there and they just want
[1648.40 - 1650.88] you dead
[1651.12 - 1655.12] and it's the new internet doctor i've
[1653.36 - 1658.96] been proven wrong
[1655.12 - 1661.84] proven wrong i screwed up i screwed up
[1658.96 - 1663.44] because for decades i've been saying
[1661.84 - 1664.80] every doctor that goes and becomes a
[1663.44 - 1665.84] doctor they got their heart in it and
[1664.80 - 1667.36] they got compassion
[1665.84 - 1669.84] and they want you better they just don't
[1667.36 - 1671.20] know the answers you can't blame them
[1669.84 - 1673.20] they're all good people because their
[1671.20 - 1678.00] hearts in it they came into it this way
[1673.20 - 1679.68] i was wrong i was wrong
[1678.00 - 1681.44] you guys need to know the traps out
[1679.68 - 1683.20] there because the traps are just getting
[1681.44 - 1684.56] bigger and uglier and bigger and uglier
[1683.20 - 1685.84] and then next thing you know everybody's
[1684.56 - 1688.64] peer pressure you need to do something
[1685.84 - 1691.68] that could hurt you too
[1688.64 - 1694.88] therese rock hi ew how much spinach
[1691.68 - 1700.48] is too much to eat studies say it has
[1694.88 - 1700.48] folates that can damage kidneys
[1700.64 - 1704.72] studies are wrong studies don't know why
[1703.44 - 1706.48] you're sick
[1704.72 - 1709.28] studies don't know why anybody sick
[1706.48 - 1710.80] studies don't know why a baby has eczema
[1709.28 - 1714.24] studies don't know why someone has
[1710.80 - 1716.64] fatigue studies don't know why anything
[1714.24 - 1718.08] studies don't know anything besides
[1716.64 - 1719.52] telling you caffeine is good for you so
[1718.08 - 1722.72] what does that tell you
[1719.52 - 1723.92] because you know caffeine is bad for you
[1722.72 - 1725.12] then why are studies telling you it's
[1723.92 - 1727.44] good
[1725.12 - 1728.40] so what does that mean studies are also
[1727.44 - 1731.04] paid for
[1728.40 - 1732.72] studies are also traps studies are also
[1731.04 - 1734.08] created and paid for to stop you from
[1732.72 - 1735.84] eating spinach
[1734.08 - 1737.12] studies are there to stop you from
[1735.84 - 1738.64] taking care of yourself because once
[1737.12 - 1741.84] again we're back to that
[1738.64 - 1744.80] we're back to paid for corrupt finger
[1741.84 - 1745.52] thumb on the scale science and research

[1754.56 - 1759.52] what you'll do

[1839.92 - 1844.00] slowly killing people
[1842.32 - 1845.36] no studies showing that the high fat
[1844.00 - 1847.52] diet and
[1845.36 - 1848.80] and protein diets are killing kidneys
[1847.52 - 1850.64] that's what kills kidneys
[1848.80 - 1852.08] it's a high protein diet you guys we

[1852.08 - 1857.44] here it comes ready um your study
[1854.80 - 1860.08] omega-3s and chicken eggs
[1857.44 - 1861.04] are really good for us and it can help
[1860.08 - 1863.04] our memory
[1861.04 - 1864.08] omega-3s and chicken eggs can help our
[1863.04 - 1866.24] memory okay
[1864.08 - 1867.52] okay here we go there we go oh another
[1866.24 - 1869.68] dog guy oh no

[1875.20 - 1880.72] let's go it's terrible
[1878.32 - 1882.00] and and that's what happens because
[1880.72 - 1884.16] we're just dogs
[1882.00 - 1886.64] waiting for a bone and that's what we
[1884.16 - 1890.72] are and people don't realize it
[1886.64 - 1894.16] they just don't get it they don't get it
[1890.72 - 1897.36] and it's really really sad it is
[1894.16 - 1900.32] because you won't eat the spinach
[1897.36 - 1902.08] all you need is one one warning flare
[1900.32 - 1905.04] where is it one warning flare
[1902.08 - 1905.04] where's that warning flare
[1905.76 - 1910.64] here it is it's a study you spinach
[1909.12 - 1913.12] might hurt your kidneys
[1910.64 - 1914.08] there's a flare all you need is one
[1913.12 - 1915.60] warning flare
[1914.08 - 1918.00] and in the back of your mind that
[1915.60 - 1920.00] brainwashing is going to take over

[1926.00 - 1931.04] so in every single study says
[1928.96 - 1932.32] inconclusive except for the caffeine
[1931.04 - 1934.32] studies
[1932.32 - 1935.76] inconclusive except for the caffeine
[1934.32 - 1937.04] studies caffeine industry they don't
[1935.76 - 1938.40] even want the word inconclusive there
[1937.04 - 1939.76] they just want to be like no you drink
[1938.40 - 1942.88] that stuff
[1939.76 - 1943.52] you drink that stuff you better eat that
[1942.88 - 1945.20] stuff

[1998.40 - 2002.08] cut open the tops
[1999.84 - 2004.48] and then they found out they can grow
[2002.08 - 2005.44] bugs inside those eggs because there's
[2004.48 - 2009.12] undeveloped
[2005.44 - 2012.96] proteins in eggs pathogens feed off of
[2009.12 - 2016.40] undeveloped proteins and eggs and so
[2012.96 - 2018.08] they've ruined our eggs you don't stand
[2016.40 - 2020.40] a chance if you're really
[2018.08 - 2022.24] sick if you're on eggs because if you're
[2020.40 - 2023.76] really sick you've got some bugs going
[2022.24 - 2025.28] on you've got the epstein bars maybe the
[2023.76 - 2025.84] simplexes that have gone a little too
[2025.28 - 2028.36] far
[2025.84 - 2029.84] maybe the sediment virus maybe the hhv
[2028.36 - 2033.44] hb6
[2029.84 - 2034.96] hhv 7 hhv-8 you got all these dip
[2033.44 - 2037.36] shingles
[2034.96 - 2038.96] streptococcus all these different bugs
[2037.36 - 2039.84] they'll feed off of these because when
[2038.96 - 2042.16] you eat them
[2039.84 - 2044.16] you eat them you eat the egg you don't
[2042.16 - 2048.00] want eggs on your spinach soup
[2044.16 - 2051.84] or your spinach salad sarah dillon
[2048.00 - 2054.88] it's this info he has a podcast about

[2179.52 - 2187.36] i like spinach i always do i like
[2182.16 - 2191.20] spinach soups to be thicker
[2187.36 - 2192.32] it's like colitis they cut your colon
[2191.20 - 2195.92] out
[2192.32 - 2195.92] because they don't know why you're sick
[2196.08 - 2199.52] you're going to bathroom you're filling
[2197.68 - 2202.56] the toilet up with blood
[2199.52 - 2204.88] you're in agony i don't know why
[2202.56 - 2207.12] they give you steroids and more steroids
[2204.88 - 2210.24] the hopes to stop it
[2207.12 - 2211.44] hopes to stop it right emergency
[2210.24 - 2213.28] medicine right
[2211.44 - 2215.20] they're giving you steroids to try to
[2213.28 - 2218.64] stop the bleeding and bleeding
[2215.20 - 2221.28] and then it just isn't working
[2218.64 - 2222.56] and then you're getting 22 inches of
[2221.28 - 2224.24] your colon cut out
[2222.56 - 2226.08] you're getting 12 inches of your colon
[2224.24 - 2228.64] cut out because
[2226.08 - 2230.00] or you get your whole entire colon cut
[2228.64 - 2232.40] out
[2230.00 - 2233.12] because they don't know why you got the
[2232.40 - 2234.64] colitis
[2233.12 - 2238.56] but you can learn the truth of what
[2234.64 - 2240.24] causes colitis in the books
[2238.56 - 2242.40] you can learn the truth the medical
[2240.24 - 2243.84] medium books and then you know the truth
[2242.40 - 2245.52] of what causes colitis this is a prime
[2243.84 - 2247.92] example
[2245.52 - 2249.60] but how many colons have they cut out i
[2247.92 - 2250.72] can't tell you how many people knocked
[2249.60 - 2254.16] on my door
[2250.72 - 2256.64] in the last 35 years right
[2254.16 - 2259.76] with already their colon removed and i
[2256.64 - 2262.56] just was brokenhearted because it didn't
[2259.76 - 2265.76] have to go that way
[2262.56 - 2268.40] so sad so sad
[2265.76 - 2270.00] so i published the books so people
[2268.40 - 2272.32] couldn't just see me one on
[2270.00 - 2274.16] one and and you know and then what about
[2272.32 - 2276.64] everybody else
[2274.16 - 2277.52] charlie says does excess spinach intake
[2276.64 - 2280.40] cause stones
[2277.52 - 2281.44] no no there's no study that can show
[2280.40 - 2283.12] that
[2281.44 - 2284.48] there's no research in science that has
[2283.12 - 2286.48] a scope that goes in your body
[2284.48 - 2287.68] to say watch that spinach it's starting
[2286.48 - 2290.48] to create a stone
[2287.68 - 2292.24] are you kidding that doesn't even exist
[2290.48 - 2293.92] and who's eating that much spinach
[2292.24 - 2295.84] i didn't know everybody's eating so much
[2293.92 - 2297.44] spinach because i just spent 35 years

[2368.16 - 2371.76] talk to people
[2369.60 - 2373.44] keto people keto doctors they get a hold
[2371.76 - 2374.72] of me be like you know i thought my keto
[2373.44 - 2376.24] was working i've been teaching about
[2374.72 - 2379.36] ketoko first of all dude
[2376.24 - 2380.40] dr dude you ain't even kido he's like
[2379.36 - 2382.24] what
[2380.40 - 2384.56] what do you mean i'm not keto that's
[2382.24 - 2386.32] impossible i'm keto i'm like you are you
[2384.56 - 2387.52] eat avocados like yeah every day i go
[2386.32 - 2390.40] you're not keto
[2387.52 - 2391.44] you can't go into ketosis just sugar and
[2390.40 - 2393.36] avocado
[2391.44 - 2396.80] i hear it all the time doctors go what
[2393.36 - 2399.04] the heck in there go you're right
[2396.80 - 2400.96] yeah you can only go into ketosis if you
[2399.04 - 2402.64] got no carbohydrate whatsoever on any
[2400.96 - 2405.44] level has to be completely eliminated
[2402.64 - 2411.84] for the body to go into ketosis
[2405.44 - 2411.84] but it's like who even eats spinach
[2413.12 - 2416.48] unbelievable like science or research
[2415.68 - 2419.28] thinks that
[2416.48 - 2420.56] knows does it first of all you guys find
[2419.28 - 2421.44] that funny i just want to ask you this
[2420.56 - 2422.88] right here
[2421.44 - 2424.48] if science research doesn't know what
[2422.88 - 2425.36] causes any of your autoimmune conditions
[2424.48 - 2427.68] whatsoever
[2425.36 - 2428.80] in any of your symptoms and conditions
[2427.68 - 2430.00] right
[2428.80 - 2432.64] except when you get heart disease and
[2430.00 - 2434.64] they still don't know the cause
[2432.64 - 2436.32] but when scientific research still
[2434.64 - 2437.60] doesn't know why anybody's sick and they
[2436.32 - 2438.40] don't know why your children have eczema
[2437.60 - 2440.00] now because guess what there's
[2438.40 - 2441.44] commercials on television with kids with
[2440.00 - 2442.40] eczema it's like what you know what that
[2441.44 - 2444.72] means right
[2442.40 - 2447.44] millions of kids have eczema millions
[2444.72 - 2448.96] science and research doesn't know this
[2447.44 - 2450.16] then how do they know spinach is going
[2448.96 - 2453.84] to give you a kidney stone i've never
[2450.16 - 2453.84] seen anything so stupid in my life
[2454.32 - 2458.08] never seen anything so stupid in my life

[2942.08 - 2946.24] now out there and then the the fake
[2944.48 - 2948.00] internet doctor that's out there now
[2946.24 - 2949.52] that just wants people's lives destroyed
[2948.00 - 2951.04] and never thought i'd say it in my life
[2949.52 - 2954.84] and never thought i'd say
[2951.04 - 2957.84] that there's a crap ton of planted
[2954.84 - 2960.00] manufactured industrialized
[2957.84 - 2962.08] doctors that are on the internet
[2960.00 - 2963.92] purposely trying to derail people by the
[2962.08 - 2965.12] thousands and thousands in hopes to get
[2963.92 - 2966.72] them sicker i never
[2965.12 - 2968.48] thought there'd be cold-hearted doctors
[2966.72 - 2969.68] but guess what we have a new age and a
[2968.48 - 2971.44] new wave of doctors
[2969.68 - 2972.88] it's the internet doctor they are the
[2971.44 - 2974.48] worst i'm not talking about internet
[2972.88 - 2976.00] doctor that works their butt off
[2974.48 - 2978.00] in their practice and then hops on the
[2976.00 - 2978.72] internet and does their thing and does
[2978.00 - 2981.60] their own
[2978.72 - 2982.96] media platforms talk about one gear
[2981.60 - 2987.60] specifically

[3035.12 - 3039.20] way to make it seriously
[3036.32 - 3040.32] i mean i like the food processor for it
[3039.20 - 3041.68] but just the blender
[3040.32 - 3044.24] blender is great this is a clove of
[3041.68 - 3046.72] garlic right here
[3044.24 - 3046.72] right here
[3049.44 - 3054.16] yep clove of garlic reading comments you
[3052.72 - 3055.20] guys both on tik tok and facebook
[3054.16 - 3058.32] youtube
[3055.20 - 3059.52] my body bloats swells badly with
[3058.32 - 3060.88] potatoes so
[3059.52 - 3062.80] i always want people to be their own
[3060.88 - 3066.08] detective lin i'm glad you're here
[3062.80 - 3069.52] um be their own protective right so
[3066.08 - 3072.00] if i had bloating and swelling right
[3069.52 - 3072.96] i'd ask myself do i ever bloat on
[3072.00 - 3074.80] anything else
[3072.96 - 3076.56] so i went through my life with no bloat
[3074.80 - 3077.68] nothing bloats me i'm going through life
[3076.56 - 3078.64] i'm going through life i would ask
[3077.68 - 3080.24] myself this
[3078.64 - 3081.76] nothing bloats me i wasn't bloated last
[3080.24 - 3083.20] week when i didn't eat a potato
[3081.76 - 3085.04] i wasn't bloated last month when i
[3083.20 - 3085.84] didn't eat a potato i wasn't bloated two
[3085.04 - 3089.28] days ago
[3085.84 - 3090.96] i'm not bloated now i'd ask myself or am
[3089.28 - 3092.48] i bloated two weeks ago did i blow up
[3090.96 - 3094.08] from some other food did i bloat for
[3092.48 - 3095.60] something i eat did i blow and what you
[3094.08 - 3096.96] might find out is you're bloating no
[3095.60 - 3099.68] matter what periodically because you
[3096.96 - 3103.44] have a bloat problem
[3099.68 - 3106.88] right and then you might have potato
[3103.44 - 3109.52] the wrong way was it steamed did it have
[3106.88 - 3112.24] oil on it did it have fat on it
[3109.52 - 3112.72] was it in bacon grease what was the pit
[3112.24 - 3114.40] was it
[3112.72 - 3115.92] was it fried did it have cheese on it
[3114.40 - 3117.52] did have sour cream on it did have
[3115.92 - 3120.56] butter on it did it butter in it
[3117.52 - 3122.00] i'd make sure that's all set right there
[3120.56 - 3124.40] and then i'd be like did i have it
[3122.00 - 3127.36] steamed like medical medium says
[3124.40 - 3129.04] and maybe with some greens or steamed
[3127.36 - 3131.20] steamed on a mono level
[3129.04 - 3133.76] mono eating cleanse level by the way you
[3131.20 - 3136.64] guys like i said mono eating cleanse
[3133.76 - 3139.84] challenge in july you want to be there
[3136.64 - 3139.84] i'm just letting you know
[3139.92 - 3144.72] have that book so these are the things i
[3142.72 - 3146.48] would actually ask myself
[3144.72 - 3148.24] or weren't you just perfectly fine never
[3146.48 - 3149.76] bloated ever all's good and then you ate
[3148.24 - 3152.40] a potato and you blowed it and like well
[3149.76 - 3154.80] that potato bloated me
[3152.40 - 3156.16] so kind of keep all that in mind did you
[3154.80 - 3158.16] do the potato the right way are you
[3156.16 - 3159.04] bloating anyway did you bloat the day
[3158.16 - 3160.96] after
[3159.04 - 3162.40] some other bad food but then you had a
[3160.96 - 3164.00] potato a day after and thought the
[3162.40 - 3165.92] potato was doing it
[3164.00 - 3167.84] when really you had a slice of vegan
[3165.92 - 3169.44] pizza a week ago and you're still
[3167.84 - 3171.28] bloated from that all these things are
[3169.44 - 3174.88] important enough
[3171.28 - 3178.00] manny palmer the mono eating takes me
[3174.88 - 3180.16] out of a bloating flair it does
[3178.00 - 3183.84] you can mono eat potatoes and get out of

[3350.72 - 3354.80] that
[3351.28 - 3354.80] that might be a smarter thing to do
[3355.20 - 3359.76] mv doom he isn't telling you what you

[3366.64 - 3373.36] noodles i got this little
[3369.20 - 3377.28] julienner right is that what we call it
[3373.36 - 3379.60] you guys let's get these noodles going
[3377.28 - 3381.28] so i'm making noodles right so these are
[3379.60 - 3382.80] cucumber noodles spinach super cucumber
[3381.28 - 3385.44] noodles is so good
[3382.80 - 3385.44] it's so good
[3386.08 - 3389.04] so let's do that let's make some noodles
[3387.92 - 3391.84] and then we're going to blend up that
[3389.04 - 3391.84] soup
[3394.16 - 3397.20] you know what people want to hear by the
[3395.60 - 3399.20] way you guys they want to hear
[3397.20 - 3400.88] you know what they want to hear they
[3399.20 - 3403.28] want to hear a two-minute
[3400.88 - 3405.04] tip they want to hear a five-minute tip
[3403.28 - 3407.92] a lot of people want to hear
[3405.04 - 3407.92] and it's sad
[3410.40 - 3415.04] if you eat right you don't get sick
[3412.32 - 3418.48] easily and avoid food that causes
[3415.04 - 3422.48] internal body inflammation
[3418.48 - 3424.88] it's not the reality of it it's not
[3422.48 - 3427.60] so you're telling plant-based people
[3424.88 - 3428.96] that are on a keto plant-based diet
[3427.60 - 3430.40] they're so called eating right and
[3428.96 - 3431.84] balanced in their plant-based but they
[3430.40 - 3433.04] get sick or they lose all their teeth or
[3431.84 - 3434.48] something starts out their teeth are
[3433.04 - 3436.64] falling apart or they get sick
[3434.48 - 3438.64] they get hives you're telling me that
[3436.64 - 3440.32] their plant-based diet that was like
[3438.64 - 3441.60] healthy avocados every day and all that
[3440.32 - 3443.44] that every single doctor would say
[3441.60 - 3445.68] they're eating right on
[3443.44 - 3447.28] you mean to tell me that well then why
[3445.68 - 3449.04] they get sick it happens every day
[3447.28 - 3450.64] plant-based people go screaming and
[3449.04 - 3452.00] running from the plant-based diet into
[3450.64 - 3453.92] back to the animal protein diet they
[3452.00 - 3456.08] start eating eggs out of nowhere
[3453.92 - 3458.56] it's not about just eating i know people
[3456.08 - 3461.76] that are eating terrible
[3458.56 - 3463.68] but they're not sick they're terrible
[3461.76 - 3465.92] because they don't have a pathogen they
[3463.68 - 3469.52] don't have the virus they don't have
[3465.92 - 3472.32] epstein-barr they don't have that okay
[3469.52 - 3474.40] they're not dealing with that they don't
[3472.32 - 3475.44] have three epstein bars in a shingles
[3474.40 - 3477.76] virus
[3475.44 - 3478.88] they don't have they don't have toxic
[3477.76 - 3480.80] heavy metals
[3478.88 - 3482.80] they may not be high in mercury where
[3480.80 - 3483.84] the virus is eating all the mercury
[3482.80 - 3485.60] they're not you know and that's the
[3483.84 - 3487.20] whole thing because that's what i mean
[3485.60 - 3488.64] you could be on the best keto diet
[3487.20 - 3490.24] best animal protein diet best
[3488.64 - 3491.76] plant-based diet that's everything and
[3490.24 - 3493.12] you still get your butt sick
[3491.76 - 3494.40] and you end up sick and now you don't
[3493.12 - 3495.60] know what to do and you're seeing all
[3494.40 - 3496.88] the different doctors and they got you
[3495.60 - 3497.68] on gut health products they're telling
[3496.88 - 3499.36] you about your
[3497.68 - 3501.04] microflora they're trying to convince
[3499.36 - 3501.60] you to do go back on this go back on
[3501.04 - 3503.20] that
[3501.60 - 3505.20] they're doing sodium bicarbonate they're
[3503.20 - 3506.08] telling you to do fish oil again mct oil
[3505.20 - 3506.96] they're telling you to do all these
[3506.08 - 3508.48] different things
[3506.96 - 3510.00] and the next new thing comes out they go
[3508.48 - 3511.44] make sure you do that make sure you do
[3510.00 - 3512.32] the pine needle tea which actually is a
[3511.44 - 3514.08] terrible tea
[3512.32 - 3515.20] terrible thing to do and it doesn't do
[3514.08 - 3516.24] what everybody says so next thing you
[3515.20 - 3517.76] know they're just telling you
[3516.24 - 3520.08] all these things and we're back to that
[3517.76 - 3520.08] again

[3524.08 - 3527.04] to heal
[3525.28 - 3528.72] and we're doing a healing tool right now
[3527.04 - 3529.36] you do your spinach soup every single

[3532.56 - 3536.16] some of those troublemakers
[3534.08 - 3537.92] medical mean information talks about you
[3536.16 - 3539.92] got a chance to heal
[3537.92 - 3541.36] you throw away your apple cider vinegar

[3576.96 - 3582.56] cooked spinach yes you can cook spinach
[3579.60 - 3584.08] but you want the spinach raw that's
[3582.56 - 3586.80] where you get the most out of
[3584.08 - 3587.60] spinach and if you can't eat a lot of
[3586.80 - 3589.44] spinach
[3587.60 - 3590.96] try the spinach soup you can get a lot
[3589.44 - 3592.40] of spinach in you that way even if you
[3590.96 - 3595.04] have a small bowl of it
[3592.40 - 3596.96] how about that how about them apples huh

[3607.60 - 3610.56] electrolytes mineral salts that's how we
[3609.84 - 3612.08] heal
[3610.56 - 3614.40] that's how we get better that's one
[3612.08 - 3618.00] option right there that's one way
[3614.40 - 3621.20] okay one way to heal
[3618.00 - 3621.20] get the old brain out
[3621.84 - 3626.96] need electrolytes you need electrolytes
[3624.88 - 3630.72] you need the mineral salts
[3626.96 - 3632.88] and the brain needs to trace mineral
[3630.72 - 3635.84] salts the brain needs the electrolytes
[3632.88 - 3637.20] this is a way to give give your brain a
[3635.84 - 3641.04] part of what it needs

[3850.64 - 3857.52] making me feel swollen and bloated
