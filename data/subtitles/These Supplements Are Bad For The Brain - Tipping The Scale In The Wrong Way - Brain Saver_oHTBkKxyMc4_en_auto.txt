[52.44 - 55.74] way they look
[53.70 - 59.16] they judge people
[55.74 - 61.38] by the way they act they judge people
[59.16 - 64.32] by their sense of humor they judge
[61.38 - 65.52] people by the way they sound they judge
[64.32 - 67.76] people
[65.52 - 70.92] through their voice the way they hear it
[67.76 - 72.48] people judge people and I want to tell

[418.02 - 420.72] saver right over here
[418.93 - 422.88] [Music]
[420.72 - 424.26] some of the medical medium protocols and
[422.88 - 426.42] I'm in
[424.26 - 427.56] brain betrayer supplements this is
[426.42 - 429.48] really important because you guys know
[427.56 - 431.10] I've been doing a couple of lives just
[429.48 - 433.20] about this
[431.10 - 434.70] these supplements fall into four main
[433.20 - 436.50] categories I have to talk about that
[434.70 - 438.08] again problematic and damaging
[436.50 - 440.66] supplements
[438.08 - 443.46] problematic and damaging supplements
[440.66 - 445.56] mildly problematic supplements
[443.46 - 447.66] overrated or overused supplements
[445.56 - 449.34] quality concerns supplements where it's
[447.66 - 451.14] especially important to seek out high
[449.34 - 452.88] quality forms because they're frequently
[451.14 - 455.04] produced with low quality ingredients or
[452.88 - 457.20] problematic additives or preservatives
[455.04 - 461.18] there's four categories
[457.20 - 464.58] in this list of problematic and damaging
[461.18 - 467.58] supplements I got alkaline ionizer water
[464.58 - 470.34] machines apple cider vinegar products
[467.58 - 472.22] taken internally Bentonite and other
[470.34 - 474.30] Clays when taken internally
[472.22 - 476.70] caffeine-based energy supplements taken
[474.30 - 479.22] internally obviously charcoal taken
[476.70 - 481.50] internally Chlorella
[479.22 - 483.68] chlorine dioxide
[481.50 - 486.90] cod liver oil or shark liver oil
[483.68 - 488.64] colostrum deer antler or also called
[486.90 - 491.60] deer velvet
[488.64 - 494.16] diatomaceous earth digestive bitters
[491.60 - 496.02] essential oils taken internally so don't
[494.16 - 497.82] get upset about that for the moment with
[496.02 - 500.16] essential oil things I know that oh my
[497.82 - 502.68] God the crap I get for even saying
[500.16 - 505.02] essential oil I mean I'm saying take it
[502.68 - 506.16] internally that's the problem right
[505.02 - 508.26] there
[506.16 - 510.30] fat burners because there's fat burners
[508.26 - 512.34] people are doing fat burners fish oil
[510.30 - 514.62] and krill oil yeah you know me people
[512.34 - 518.04] that are on krill oil it's insane not
[514.62 - 519.80] good terrible gut powder blends
[518.04 - 522.12] herbal tinctures and alcohol
[519.80 - 525.06] hydrochloric acid supplements you know
[522.12 - 527.64] what I mean HCL supplements L-Carnitine
[525.06 - 530.64] supplements or L-Arginine supplements
[527.64 - 534.42] mineral oil mushroom coffee with
[530.64 - 536.58] caffeine oyster supplements Pearl powder
[534.42 - 538.68] sodium bicarbonate you know the whole
[536.58 - 540.18] sodium bicarbonate thing right where you
[538.68 - 542.76] take all you mix it all and we'll drink
[540.18 - 545.82] it all down and take oh man turpentine
[542.76 - 549.78] oil whey protein powder and zeolites
[545.82 - 552.54] those are the problematic and damaging
[549.78 - 555.00] supplement list
[552.54 - 556.68] so I went through a bunch of these the
[555.00 - 558.66] other day I didn't go through all of
[556.68 - 560.94] them but I went through colostrum I did
[558.66 - 562.80] chlorella the day before I talked about
[560.94 - 564.00] charcoal I talked about all these I'm
[562.80 - 565.86] giving you this before warning here
[564.00 - 568.02] alkaline ionized or water machines why
[565.86 - 569.58] they're bad when you see the book you
[568.02 - 571.14] can read all about it and you'll be mind
[569.58 - 573.18] blown because it's protecting you the
[571.14 - 574.98] information which is incredible
[573.18 - 576.44] I talked about the zeolites now I want
[574.98 - 578.88] to say something about the zeolite thing
[576.44 - 580.86] because recently some stuff popped up
[578.88 - 583.86] because of this right
[580.86 - 585.42] so someone will say well it's a zeolite
[583.86 - 588.50] that you know I've been doing you know
[585.42 - 592.32] I've been doing the heavy metal detox
[588.50 - 593.88] smoothie and as soon as I brought in a
[592.32 - 596.04] little zeolite things seemed to move
[593.88 - 597.66] along it's like well you have to
[596.04 - 599.40] understand how the heavy metal detox
[597.66 - 602.16] smoothie works when you're doing the
[599.40 - 604.44] heavy metal detox smoothie for months
[602.16 - 607.02] it'll finally get to a point where it
[604.44 - 609.60] removes just enough metal where now
[607.02 - 611.58] results are starting to happen
[609.60 - 613.26] sometimes people get really quick
[611.58 - 615.36] results from the heavy metal detox
[613.26 - 616.74] smoothie but when you have metal deep in
[615.36 - 620.64] the brain
[616.74 - 623.76] it can take months and months of getting
[620.64 - 625.98] the metal out from the midline canal
[623.76 - 627.96] zeolite doesn't cross the blood-brain
[625.98 - 630.42] barrier zeolite does not enter the
[627.96 - 633.72] bloodstream so zeolite cannot get toxic
[630.42 - 636.18] heavy metals out of a child's brain it
[633.72 - 639.00] cannot get toxic heavy metals out of an
[636.18 - 641.10] adult's brain it's impossible it's like
[639.00 - 643.50] a clay it sits in the intestinal tract
[641.10 - 645.36] and it can't get into the bloodstream or
[643.50 - 647.94] cross the blood-brain barrier you have
[645.36 - 651.84] to understand clay can't enter your
[647.94 - 654.30] bloodstream or you will die
[651.84 - 655.74] clay can only stay in the intestinal
[654.30 - 658.08] tract
[655.74 - 660.30] and cling to the lining it can't enter
[658.08 - 663.36] your bloodstream
[660.30 - 665.58] zeolite cannot enter your bloodstream or
[663.36 - 667.26] you'll get a stroke and a blood clot and
[665.58 - 668.88] die
[667.26 - 673.26] see how it works
[668.88 - 675.42] you can't have zeolite or clay float
[673.26 - 678.78] around in your bloodstream it will
[675.42 - 681.90] literally give you an aneurysm embolism
[678.78 - 684.00] a blood clot it'll blow out it'll blow
[681.90 - 685.80] out a blood vessel you will have a
[684.00 - 687.80] stroke and die
[685.80 - 690.36] so what I'm trying to tell you is
[687.80 - 692.16] zeolite can't get Metals out of your
[690.36 - 694.68] brain
[692.16 - 696.48] the heavy metal detox smoothie in the
[694.68 - 698.58] medical medium books gets metal out of
[696.48 - 700.80] people's brains
[698.58 - 702.72] and there's a different story it's a
[700.80 - 704.34] different thing so you can be doing the
[702.72 - 706.86] heavy metal detox smoothie for a while
[704.34 - 708.72] and it's taking you to just about that
[706.86 - 710.28] threshold of healing and then you try
[708.72 - 712.26] something else you put some coconut oil
[710.28 - 713.82] and you're like two weeks later after
[712.26 - 715.74] doing a little coconut oil you're like
[713.82 - 717.24] oh it's the coconut oil me no it was the
[715.74 - 719.76] three months of heavy metal detox
[717.24 - 721.98] smoothies you did or I tried a little
[719.76 - 724.56] zeolite spray
[721.98 - 727.26] um three months into it and three weeks
[724.56 - 729.36] later it started to change that's from
[727.26 - 731.10] three months of the heavy metal detox
[729.36 - 733.02] smoothie or six months of the heavy
[731.10 - 735.36] metal detox smoothie or one month of the
[733.02 - 738.60] heavy metal detox smoothie
[735.36 - 740.64] Clays and zeolite cannot enter into the
[738.60 - 742.56] bloodstream nor can it cross the
[740.64 - 746.04] blood-brain barrier nor can it enter the
[742.56 - 749.40] brain critical to know so this is a
[746.04 - 751.08] really the details are so important in
[749.40 - 753.18] the books the brain saver books that go
[751.08 - 755.22] into depth details about the heavy metal
[753.18 - 757.26] detox movie how it works how the
[755.22 - 760.08] ingredients work together and so much
[757.26 - 762.84] information about how Metals work that
[760.08 - 765.36] no one has really amazing information
[762.84 - 766.86] you guys so let's talk about the zeolite
[765.36 - 768.54] thing one more time because I want to
[766.86 - 771.00] run I want to run by this because I saw
[768.54 - 773.52] some comments saying someone say oh yeah
[771.00 - 775.08] no uh the Zeal I was doing the heavy
[773.52 - 776.64] metal detox smoothie for a few months
[775.08 - 778.32] and then after like a few weeks of
[776.64 - 780.48] trying a zeolite things started moving
[778.32 - 781.44] forward um no that was after three
[780.48 - 783.84] months
[781.44 - 785.46] things started moving forward take the
[783.84 - 787.32] heavy metal detox smoothie out of your
[785.46 - 790.08] life completely remove all medical
[787.32 - 791.88] medium tools remove everything and then
[790.08 - 794.40] you try the zeolite on its own and see
[791.88 - 796.44] where you stand and see where it goes
[794.40 - 797.64] you'll end up like people did 15 years
[796.44 - 800.40] ago
[797.64 - 803.04] where they all tried the zeolites and
[800.40 - 804.48] nobody got better until they've learned
[803.04 - 806.82] about the medical medium heavy metal
[804.48 - 808.98] detox smoothie it was the opposite
[806.82 - 811.08] people were all on their zeolites the
[808.98 - 813.00] zeolite craze already happened and no
[811.08 - 815.34] one got better from years ago but no one
[813.00 - 817.50] knows about that because every five
[815.34 - 819.72] years history just boom repeats itself
[817.50 - 821.22] you get a whole bunch of new suckers and
[819.72 - 822.78] then it moves forward and moves forward
[821.22 - 824.94] like that
[822.78 - 829.26] so in the zeolite talk this is a really
[824.94 - 832.08] important aspect of it because when
[829.26 - 834.18] you're doing the heavy metal detox movie
[832.08 - 837.06] then you see the results as you go along
[834.18 - 838.86] and anything you bring in sure you could
[837.06 - 841.02] just be like oh I was
[838.86 - 844.14] I don't know
[841.02 - 846.06] I was doing a lot of oregano uh for a
[844.14 - 846.90] week and then two months later I started
[846.06 - 848.58] getting better it must have been the
[846.90 - 850.38] regular no it's not the heavy metal it's
[848.58 - 852.66] not the heavy metal detox movie it was
[850.38 - 855.24] the oregano no so here's how it works
[852.66 - 857.46] like in the past 20 years ago 18 years
[855.24 - 858.54] ago 16 years ago when the zeolite craze
[857.46 - 860.76] came in
[858.54 - 862.08] and all the big marketing companies were
[860.76 - 865.08] trying to push it
[862.08 - 867.24] and all the lies about how it worked all
[865.08 - 869.04] came in because it never leaves the
[867.24 - 871.38] intestinal tract because Eli can't get
[869.04 - 873.12] out of your intestinal tract it's a clay
[871.38 - 874.56] if it goes in your bloodstream if it
[873.12 - 876.00] actually really physically went into
[874.56 - 877.44] your bloodstream you would die of a
[876.00 - 880.26] stroke it would get to your brain clog
[877.44 - 882.42] you up and you would die of a stroke
[880.26 - 884.28] Ella says Nano side seal Light May well
[882.42 - 886.26] enter the bloodstream it doesn't well
[884.28 - 888.18] enter the bloodstream at all and cross
[886.26 - 889.86] the blood brain barrier first Ella
[888.18 - 891.48] that's not true they've never seen it
[889.86 - 893.22] they've never tested for it they don't
[891.48 - 894.48] have one document that shows it and they
[893.22 - 895.38] don't have any signs that shows it
[894.48 - 898.20] either
[895.38 - 901.08] it doesn't reach the bloodstream that's
[898.20 - 904.26] what they tell you and but that's not
[901.08 - 906.90] accurate first of all clay
[904.26 - 909.84] can't reach the bloodstream
[906.90 - 912.12] clay and zeolite it's all the same it
[909.84 - 914.52] can't reach the bloodstream it can't
[912.12 - 916.14] enter into it it stays in your
[914.52 - 918.42] intestinal tract but that's where you're
[916.14 - 920.46] fooled and the thing is
[918.42 - 923.52] It's tricky because they get you on the
[920.46 - 925.08] MLM maybe not UL but they get you on and
[923.52 - 927.84] and I appreciate your comment they get
[925.08 - 930.12] you on the the the whole thing where
[927.84 - 931.32] it's the MLM thing out there or they get
[930.12 - 933.30] you on that whole thing where
[931.32 - 935.76] everybody's selling it and so
[933.30 - 938.46] everybody's sparking out the same stuff
[935.76 - 940.32] but just so you know they've been saying
[938.46 - 944.22] it crosses the blood-brain barrier for
[940.32 - 945.90] 20 years and 20 years ago Ella just for
[944.22 - 948.42] the record
[945.90 - 950.76] anybody who's using zeolites never moved
[948.42 - 953.58] forward it never did anything
[950.76 - 957.66] it was that it was I had thousands of
[953.58 - 960.42] people call my office thousands saying
[957.66 - 962.64] that I've been on zeolite and I had to
[960.42 - 964.44] get them on the heavy metal detox movie
[962.64 - 966.18] to change their lives the heavy metal
[964.44 - 968.82] detox movie that's worldwide famous
[966.18 - 971.52] right now because it's literally changed
[968.82 - 973.02] so many people's lives and in the brain
[971.52 - 976.14] saver books
[973.02 - 977.34] there's a seven okay the seven levels of
[976.14 - 980.04] the head seven different heavy metal
[977.34 - 982.74] detox cleanses by the way but it's got
[980.04 - 986.04] street cred it saved people's lives for
[982.74 - 988.38] years before I even put it in the books
[986.04 - 990.60] and I had to do that because zeolite
[988.38 - 992.82] wasn't working so they've done a flip
[990.60 - 994.68] now everybody's on the heavy metal detox
[992.82 - 995.94] movie
[994.68 - 999.54] and then
[995.94 - 1001.58] the sales reps of zeolite try to get the
[999.54 - 1003.68] medical medium community on the zeolite
[1001.58 - 1005.54] because they know it's a Sure Shot
[1003.68 - 1008.12] because the the medical medium
[1005.54 - 1009.20] communities on the heavy metal detox
[1008.12 - 1012.14] smoothie
[1009.20 - 1013.52] so when they throw in zeolite it's like
[1012.14 - 1015.62] a Sure Shot
[1013.52 - 1018.08] because they're already getting better
[1015.62 - 1019.58] from the heavy metal detox smoothie
[1018.08 - 1021.74] so
[1019.58 - 1024.02] let's go into this look the claims they
[1021.74 - 1025.28] are making about zeolite are not true
[1024.02 - 1027.98] out there
[1025.28 - 1030.44] and I talk about that in the brain saver
[1027.98 - 1032.18] books but it's important to know what I
[1030.44 - 1034.82] recommend if you're big on zeolite then
[1032.18 - 1036.80] throw away all your medical medium tools
[1034.82 - 1039.86] and you rely on your zeolite and see how
[1036.80 - 1042.20] far you go like people did in the past
[1039.86 - 1044.72] throw away your your celery juice throw
[1042.20 - 1047.42] away your leafy greens throw away throw
[1044.72 - 1049.64] away all your berries because that guess
[1047.42 - 1051.14] what berries were anti-in Health it was
[1049.64 - 1052.88] all anti-berries
[1051.14 - 1054.02] keto movements all the movements it
[1052.88 - 1055.40] wouldn't even allow a piece of fruit
[1054.02 - 1058.58] that's all medical medium that brought
[1055.40 - 1060.92] in all the fruit in the last 25 years so
[1058.58 - 1062.30] take away all the medical medium tools
[1060.92 - 1063.98] get rid of all your fruit and your
[1062.30 - 1066.80] berries and your Apples because it was
[1063.98 - 1070.40] illegal to eat a red apple on any diet
[1066.80 - 1073.28] program in the last 25 years so get rid
[1070.40 - 1075.26] of all the medical medium the kale
[1073.28 - 1076.94] which medical mean brought in get rid of
[1075.26 - 1079.16] the lemon water and medical medium
[1076.94 - 1080.84] brought in get rid of all medical medium
[1079.16 - 1082.88] tools
[1080.84 - 1086.12] and just focus on your zeolite and see
[1082.88 - 1088.10] how far that goes it won't go anywhere
[1086.12 - 1090.32] seal lights are not safe now because
[1088.10 - 1091.64] they're cross-contaminated so let's talk
[1090.32 - 1095.54] about it right now I'm in the brain
[1091.64 - 1097.58] saver book okay and someone who has a
[1095.54 - 1099.20] problem with their intestinal tract it's
[1097.58 - 1101.92] a whole other story but let's just go
[1099.20 - 1104.90] into it in recent years
[1101.92 - 1106.88] inedible varieties of zeolites have been
[1104.90 - 1109.46] Unearthed and manufactured in the same
[1106.88 - 1111.14] places as edible zeolites causing
[1109.46 - 1113.42] cross-contamination so here's what's
[1111.14 - 1114.86] happening now
[1113.42 - 1118.16] all the zeolites have
[1114.86 - 1120.20] cross-contamination of inedible zeolites
[1118.16 - 1123.02] and I have to be the messenger for this
[1120.20 - 1124.10] which is really important because when
[1123.02 - 1127.64] you're sick
[1124.10 - 1130.70] you don't have time and room to play
[1127.64 - 1132.56] neither edible nor inedible zeolites
[1130.70 - 1134.42] cross the blood-brain barrier if you
[1132.56 - 1136.52] hear that you guys neither edible or
[1134.42 - 1138.38] inedible zeolites cross the blood-brain
[1136.52 - 1142.54] barrier
[1138.38 - 1142.54] nor do they enter the brain
[1142.78 - 1146.72] cross-contaminated zeolites varieties
[1145.10 - 1148.76] stay in the intestinal tract and
[1146.72 - 1152.60] irritate the lining causing dehydration
[1148.76 - 1155.60] and vagus nerve sensitivities
[1152.60 - 1157.82] there has never been any proof in our
[1155.60 - 1159.80] history that has shown a zeolite
[1157.82 - 1162.68] crossing the blood-brain barrier nor
[1159.80 - 1164.60] entering the bloodstream
[1162.68 - 1166.76] that's how demented the whole thing is
[1164.60 - 1169.40] too
[1166.76 - 1171.46] edible zeolites even if you have every
[1169.40 - 1173.54] insurance that they're not
[1171.46 - 1175.34] cross-contaminated should not be taken
[1173.54 - 1177.50] in high dosages or long term because
[1175.34 - 1179.78] even edible zeolite varieties build up
[1177.50 - 1181.88] inside the gut creating imbalances in
[1179.78 - 1183.50] dehydration so if you're you're somebody
[1181.88 - 1185.78] dealing with a neurological problem and
[1183.50 - 1187.88] this is what I saw anyone taking too
[1185.78 - 1189.68] much zeolite with neurological problems
[1187.88 - 1192.32] it would dehydrate them and bring down
[1189.68 - 1195.32] their electrolytes robbing electrolytes
[1192.32 - 1198.14] large dosages of zeolites can create a
[1195.32 - 1200.24] trace mineral imbalance because zeolites
[1198.14 - 1202.58] don't have a discernment between what's
[1200.24 - 1205.10] toxic heavy metals and what's a precious
[1202.58 - 1207.80] Trace mineral so get this one
[1205.10 - 1210.62] when you take zeolites
[1207.80 - 1212.96] the zeolite doesn't have any discernment
[1210.62 - 1214.46] between a heavy metal or your precious
[1212.96 - 1217.10] trace minerals
[1214.46 - 1219.68] your precious trace minerals
[1217.10 - 1222.64] that's a really big important one right
[1219.68 - 1222.64] there all on its own
[1223.04 - 1227.42] large dosages of zeolite can create
[1225.20 - 1229.10] Trace mineral imbalances because zeoids
[1227.42 - 1230.78] don't have this discernment which is
[1229.10 - 1232.70] really important zeolites do not travel
[1230.78 - 1234.86] into the bloodstream binding onto toxic
[1232.70 - 1237.04] heavy metals their zeolites are not a
[1234.86 - 1239.18] reliable binder
[1237.04 - 1241.64] zeolites only stay in the intestinal
[1239.18 - 1243.20] tract just like clay as zeolite sit
[1241.64 - 1244.70] inside the intestinal tract they can
[1243.20 - 1246.74] interrupt trace minerals from leaving
[1244.70 - 1249.08] the intestinal tract and entering the
[1246.74 - 1251.96] liver anyway I'm just covering zeolites
[1249.08 - 1254.06] a little bit more because it breaks my
[1251.96 - 1256.46] heart
[1254.06 - 1257.96] to see people who are sick and
[1256.46 - 1260.12] struggling
[1257.96 - 1261.38] get the scale tipped the wrong way all
[1260.12 - 1263.42] the time
[1261.38 - 1265.82] it's like who has that time and energy
[1263.42 - 1267.74] when you're sick and chronically ill the
[1265.82 - 1270.26] brain saver books
[1267.74 - 1272.12] change all that in the medical medium
[1270.26 - 1276.26] books have changed all that
[1272.12 - 1279.38] the thing is is if nobody ever healed
[1276.26 - 1282.02] or got improvements or got out of their
[1279.38 - 1284.72] wheelchairs for medical medium books and
[1282.02 - 1287.00] information if nobody ever heals all
[1284.72 - 1288.92] these years
[1287.00 - 1290.90] and I and I didn't have all this
[1288.92 - 1292.16] information from above to put into these
[1290.90 - 1294.56] books and put out there no one ever
[1292.16 - 1297.98] healed then I I should probably shut up
[1294.56 - 1300.92] I should just shut up and not and not
[1297.98 - 1303.32] and just be like okay what zeolites
[1300.92 - 1305.00] enter the brain sure let me go get that
[1303.32 - 1307.76] see like product
[1305.00 - 1310.04] I should just be quiet
[1307.76 - 1312.80] but the truth is medical meaning of
[1310.04 - 1315.68] information has saved so many people
[1312.80 - 1318.92] and has protected so many people
[1315.68 - 1320.12] and and so it's all about looking out
[1318.92 - 1322.58] for that person so they don't
[1320.12 - 1324.14] accidentally do something like this okay
[1322.58 - 1326.00] let's talk about diatomaceous earth
[1324.14 - 1327.80] particles which I didn't cover
[1326.00 - 1330.50] so I'm going to go into diatomaceous
[1327.80 - 1332.74] earth particles in here so I'm in
[1330.50 - 1336.68] problematic and damaging
[1332.74 - 1338.66] supplements so let's go there now
[1336.68 - 1339.92] so many people have tried diatomaceous
[1338.66 - 1341.96] earth so it's not that I'm just picking
[1339.92 - 1343.42] on zeolite let's let's hit diatomaceous
[1341.96 - 1346.34] earth for a minute
[1343.42 - 1348.62] agitates and clings to the intestinal
[1346.34 - 1351.08] Linings and does not leave the
[1348.62 - 1354.20] intestinal tract quickly so if somebody
[1351.08 - 1356.48] eats diatomaceous earth
[1354.20 - 1357.92] it clings to the intestinal tract but
[1356.48 - 1359.96] doesn't leave
[1357.92 - 1362.36] that's a big problem for people that are
[1359.96 - 1365.90] struggling abrasive
[1362.36 - 1369.32] to sensitive nerves
[1365.90 - 1371.60] throughout the stomach so check this out
[1369.32 - 1374.18] so there's a question what about fulvic
[1371.60 - 1376.04] zeolite I used it with chlorella and my
[1374.18 - 1378.68] tests were good
[1376.04 - 1381.14] get rid of all medical medium tools
[1378.68 - 1383.18] all of them and just go ahead and use
[1381.14 - 1386.36] fall vacant zeolite
[1383.18 - 1389.06] and then after a year or whatever
[1386.36 - 1391.10] let me know how your tests are
[1389.06 - 1393.74] that you'll be going back on all the
[1391.10 - 1395.96] medical medium tools chlorella is a
[1393.74 - 1397.64] problem all on its own so let's talk
[1395.96 - 1399.56] about Chlorella
[1397.64 - 1400.82] and we'll do that after diatomaceous
[1399.56 - 1402.44] earth I actually will go straight to
[1400.82 - 1404.36] chlorella now
[1402.44 - 1407.24] and it's in the book so you can learn
[1404.36 - 1408.74] right here it's in the books
[1407.24 - 1410.90] leafy greens weren't in the health
[1408.74 - 1412.52] movement that's a medical medium tool I
[1410.90 - 1414.62] know that irritates some people because
[1412.52 - 1417.38] they remember leafy greens in the last
[1414.62 - 1419.60] five years or six years or something or
[1417.38 - 1421.82] they heard it from somebody else but you
[1419.60 - 1423.98] weren't even allowed to eat a leafy
[1421.82 - 1425.66] green go back 25 years ago it was
[1423.98 - 1427.40] iceberg lettuce in the health movement
[1425.66 - 1431.96] it was romaine lettuce in the health
[1427.40 - 1433.94] movement and so basically you know leafy
[1431.96 - 1435.86] greens is a tool on its own you get rid
[1433.94 - 1437.60] of your leafy greens you get rid of all
[1435.86 - 1440.30] the other things in your berries and
[1437.60 - 1442.40] your apples get rid of the lemon lemon
[1440.30 - 1444.62] waters this is how it works with all
[1442.40 - 1447.26] Trends not enough considerations being
[1444.62 - 1449.12] given to who can have fun dabbling with
[1447.26 - 1452.18] the trend and who doesn't have room to
[1449.12 - 1454.46] play medical medium
[1452.18 - 1456.14] information there here we go let's talk
[1454.46 - 1458.72] about Chlorella
[1456.14 - 1460.88] chlorella does not bind on to toxic
[1458.72 - 1463.06] heavy metals properly this is important
[1460.88 - 1465.74] to know
[1463.06 - 1467.90] chlorella spreads toxic heavy metals
[1465.74 - 1469.16] into adjacent tissue so if you're using
[1467.90 - 1473.24] Chlorella
[1469.16 - 1474.56] you're spreading metal potentially into
[1473.24 - 1477.98] tissue
[1474.56 - 1480.98] that's next to the metal
[1477.98 - 1483.14] chlorella doesn't does not have the
[1480.98 - 1484.40] ability to remove toxic heavy metals
[1483.14 - 1486.56] from the body so when you actually
[1484.40 - 1488.48] consume chlorelli you can't remove a
[1486.56 - 1491.06] toxic heavy metal out of the body
[1488.48 - 1494.24] it's not going to happen
[1491.06 - 1496.70] chlorella is not antibacterial and it's
[1494.24 - 1498.38] not antiviral either
[1496.70 - 1501.32] one of the big reasons why so many
[1498.38 - 1503.60] people are sick rather it often contains
[1501.32 - 1506.30] bad bacteria resulting in foodborne or
[1503.60 - 1509.02] illness so here's here's the story of
[1506.30 - 1509.02] Chlorella
[1509.72 - 1515.60] probably one of the most negligent
[1512.74 - 1518.30] supplements that have been in the trendy
[1515.60 - 1520.64] world for a long time it's caused
[1518.30 - 1521.96] tremendous pain and suffering for a lot
[1520.64 - 1525.44] of people
[1521.96 - 1527.18] because it often carries a bacteria
[1525.44 - 1530.00] within it
[1527.18 - 1531.74] that bacteria doesn't get
[1530.00 - 1534.50] found
[1531.74 - 1538.04] and it gets out in the market and people
[1534.50 - 1541.88] get very very sick I've seen people
[1538.04 - 1544.10] vomiting for days and days hospitalized
[1541.88 - 1547.52] because of Chlorella I've seen people
[1544.10 - 1549.32] suffer great great disadvantages and
[1547.52 - 1551.24] their healing process
[1549.32 - 1555.32] because of Chlorella
[1551.24 - 1557.60] I've seen people gut sick on and off for
[1555.32 - 1559.82] years because of chlorella because of
[1557.60 - 1562.10] the foodborne pathogens
[1559.82 - 1565.82] bacteria that's in chlorella over the
[1562.10 - 1566.78] years I would not even put that stuff on
[1565.82 - 1568.46] my
[1566.78 - 1571.70] table top
[1568.46 - 1573.56] I just don't trust it to that degree
[1571.70 - 1574.88] okay so the so back to that what's wrong
[1573.56 - 1576.02] with diatomaceous earth particles
[1574.88 - 1577.40] everyone
[1576.02 - 1578.78] let's go we're in the brain saver
[1577.40 - 1580.04] protocols
[1578.78 - 1583.40] you guys are on sale right now
[1580.04 - 1585.20] amazon.com I want you to know and these
[1583.40 - 1587.48] are two incredible books released at
[1585.20 - 1589.52] once getting both of them is critical
[1587.48 - 1591.32] not just one of them
[1589.52 - 1593.54] they're big textbooks filled with
[1591.32 - 1595.70] information they're packed if you just
[1593.54 - 1597.86] got on here
[1595.70 - 1599.86] and they're 40 off let's talk about
[1597.86 - 1602.12] diatomaceous earth particles here
[1599.86 - 1603.62] agitates and clings to the intestinal
[1602.12 - 1605.30] Linings and does not leave the
[1603.62 - 1607.46] intestinal tract quickly if you have
[1605.30 - 1609.44] vagus nerve issues
[1607.46 - 1613.58] if you have anything going on with
[1609.44 - 1615.56] anxiety any kind of things like that
[1613.58 - 1618.08] anything happening with your intestinal
[1615.56 - 1620.18] tract Crohn's colitis IBS not even that
[1618.08 - 1621.98] just digestive trouble
[1620.18 - 1624.20] diatomaceous earth particles is the
[1621.98 - 1626.72] worst thing you can put in your system
[1624.20 - 1628.58] another terrible mistake that's been
[1626.72 - 1629.96] thrown on the chronically ill the
[1628.58 - 1632.06] chronically ill
[1629.96 - 1633.92] they're the guinea pigs
[1632.06 - 1635.36] they're the guinea pigs
[1633.92 - 1638.48] okay
[1635.36 - 1640.34] and they're the ones that have to like
[1638.48 - 1642.14] feed the system out there the corrupt
[1640.34 - 1644.06] system of supplements and the corrupt
[1642.14 - 1645.86] system of whatever out there
[1644.06 - 1648.14] Pharmaceuticals whatever they have to
[1645.86 - 1650.06] feed the system
[1648.14 - 1651.38] the chronicle are always taken advantage
[1650.06 - 1653.42] of
[1651.38 - 1656.42] and the medical medium books you'll find
[1653.42 - 1658.16] consistency not contradict no
[1656.42 - 1659.72] contradictions you won't find
[1658.16 - 1662.72] contradictions in the work I've done
[1659.72 - 1665.48] going all the way back for decades
[1662.72 - 1666.92] and so there's a reason lots of reasons
[1665.48 - 1668.66] for that and the problem is like when
[1666.92 - 1670.70] you take an example like diatomaceous
[1668.66 - 1673.34] earth particles I can't tell you how
[1670.70 - 1676.04] many people their immune systems tanked
[1673.34 - 1679.72] because of Diatomaceous Earth
[1676.04 - 1679.72] it drops the immune system
[1681.74 - 1686.84] abrasive to sensitive nerves
[1685.40 - 1688.64] throughout the stomach duodenum
[1686.84 - 1690.80] intestinal tract triggering symptoms of
[1688.64 - 1692.90] sensitive vagus nerves people do all
[1690.80 - 1694.88] these Health Trends and supplements and
[1692.90 - 1698.54] they do okay sometimes if they aren't
[1694.88 - 1701.06] really sick if they're not that sick yet
[1698.54 - 1704.60] but these trendy supplements are doing
[1701.06 - 1706.34] their damage and it shows up later no
[1704.60 - 1710.32] one understands what's really happening
[1706.34 - 1710.32] and they pay the price later
[1711.92 - 1717.68] okay so diatomaceous earth particles
[1715.34 - 1719.90] cause problems throughout the stomach
[1717.68 - 1721.94] duodenum and intestinal tract triggering
[1719.90 - 1723.68] symptoms of sensitive vagus nerves so
[1721.94 - 1726.02] here you are you're somebody with a
[1723.68 - 1728.90] sensitive vagus nerve issue
[1726.02 - 1731.12] and you're trying to heal
[1728.90 - 1732.86] you got all kinds of ticks and spasms
[1731.12 - 1734.12] you got tightness in the chest you got a
[1732.86 - 1735.74] little bit of panic every now and then
[1734.12 - 1737.90] you got anxiety you're struggling
[1735.74 - 1740.54] emotionally you're struggling physically
[1737.90 - 1742.58] you have some vertigo you have some
[1740.54 - 1744.80] dizziness maybe you have something else
[1742.58 - 1746.54] going on and you're dealing with a vagus
[1744.80 - 1747.98] nerve sensitivity maybe digestive
[1746.54 - 1751.04] trouble and problems because of your
[1747.98 - 1752.60] vagus nerves and someone says oh here's
[1751.04 - 1754.22] an ad right here take a look at this
[1752.60 - 1757.58] diatomaceous earth or you should be on
[1754.22 - 1759.74] diatomaceous earth and you take it
[1757.58 - 1761.36] here's another thing about Diatomaceous
[1759.74 - 1764.20] Earth get this one
[1761.36 - 1767.96] also be cautious not to inhale
[1764.20 - 1770.00] diatomaceous earth not to inhale it
[1767.96 - 1771.74] I've seen terrible things happen to
[1770.00 - 1773.92] people when they inhale diatomaceous
[1771.74 - 1773.92] earth
[1774.02 - 1777.74] due to its ability to lower the immune
[1776.72 - 1780.86] system
[1777.74 - 1783.38] when caught in the lungs
[1780.86 - 1786.04] if you breathe in diatomaceous earth
[1783.38 - 1786.04] particles
[1786.32 - 1791.30] they get caught in the lungs and they
[1788.96 - 1792.86] lower the immune system of the person so
[1791.30 - 1794.66] that means if you have something like
[1792.86 - 1797.30] Epstein-Barr if you have something like
[1794.66 - 1800.12] streptococcus if you have Simplex herpes
[1797.30 - 1802.22] one if you have a cold sores if you have
[1800.12 - 1804.98] anything going on in your life
[1802.22 - 1807.98] if you have cancer if you're breathing
[1804.98 - 1810.32] in diatomaceous earth particles
[1807.98 - 1812.24] and they get in your lungs it lowers
[1810.32 - 1813.80] your immune system
[1812.24 - 1816.50] you guys got to check out the brain
[1813.80 - 1819.14] saver books they just came out now
[1816.50 - 1822.32] they're miracles for the chronically ill
[1819.14 - 1826.22] because they they protect
[1822.32 - 1828.08] I can say this because it's true also be
[1826.22 - 1830.54] cautious not to inhale diatomaceous
[1828.08 - 1834.38] earth due to its ability to lower the
[1830.54 - 1837.26] immune system when caught in the lungs
[1834.38 - 1839.12] so you guys there's a list of 55 brain
[1837.26 - 1841.04] betrayer supplements in these books with
[1839.12 - 1842.90] in-depth information on why it's a good
[1841.04 - 1845.74] idea to stay away from these supplements
[1842.90 - 1845.74] I'm letting you know
[1846.74 - 1850.64] and by the way it's an honor to be here
[1848.54 - 1852.80] again you guys are going to look forward
[1850.64 - 1854.96] to actually connecting with you guys and
[1852.80 - 1857.36] showing you the books it's really it's
[1854.96 - 1861.50] just been so wonderful
[1857.36 - 1863.42] white blood cells whoa gotta hear this
[1861.50 - 1866.90] about Diatomaceous Earths I forgot about
[1863.42 - 1869.18] this I forgot about this
[1866.90 - 1873.02] this is mind-blowing right here
[1869.18 - 1874.40] white blood cells see diatomaceous earth
[1873.02 - 1878.54] particles
[1874.40 - 1880.64] as foreign Invaders and have to consume
[1878.54 - 1881.96] them how do you like that they have to
[1880.64 - 1884.42] consume them
[1881.96 - 1885.74] I got a white blood cell right here
[1884.42 - 1889.10] okay
[1885.74 - 1892.76] so let's just pretend this sponge
[1889.10 - 1895.46] is a diatomaceous earth particle okay
[1892.76 - 1898.28] so you breathe in the diatomaceous earth
[1895.46 - 1900.56] particles or you swallow them
[1898.28 - 1901.70] and your white blood cells have to come
[1900.56 - 1904.52] along
[1901.70 - 1907.82] and they have to devour
[1904.52 - 1910.22] the diatomaceous earth particle
[1907.82 - 1912.40] and that's how it's lowering the immune
[1910.22 - 1912.40] system
[1916.46 - 1919.88] so when white blood cells see a
[1918.02 - 1922.04] diatomaceous earth particle as a foreign
[1919.88 - 1924.74] Invader it has to consume them which can
[1922.04 - 1927.44] lead to an over burdened lymphatic
[1924.74 - 1930.38] immune system so an overburdict
[1927.44 - 1932.90] lymphatic immune system you know lymph
[1930.38 - 1934.88] nodes so your lymphatic system through
[1932.90 - 1939.14] your body so that's your white blood
[1934.88 - 1941.60] count right there so it's it's devouring
[1939.14 - 1944.06] those Earth particles
[1941.60 - 1945.68] allowing pathogens such as viruses to
[1944.06 - 1947.12] take advantage and create a flare-up on
[1945.68 - 1951.44] a chronic condition so let's go back to
[1947.12 - 1953.12] this a chronic flare-up so say someone
[1951.44 - 1954.98] is trying to get into Health they're
[1953.12 - 1956.42] getting rid of processed foods they've
[1954.98 - 1957.68] found their way a little bit through the
[1956.42 - 1961.48] health world
[1957.68 - 1961.48] maybe they pick up celery juice
[1961.70 - 1966.38] medical medium tool or something
[1963.98 - 1968.48] but at the same time
[1966.38 - 1970.28] they're also doing things like they got
[1968.48 - 1972.38] stuff in here like they're like well
[1970.28 - 1974.78] let's see I got my diatomaceous earth
[1972.38 - 1977.12] particles here I got my zeolites over
[1974.78 - 1978.56] here I got my full McDonald's what else
[1977.12 - 1980.54] do I have and I got a whole bunch of
[1978.56 - 1982.76] stuff and here they are they're trying
[1980.54 - 1985.16] to move themselves forward
[1982.76 - 1987.08] they're trying to get themselves better
[1985.16 - 1989.06] and then there's this battle happening
[1987.08 - 1991.10] that they don't know this war happening
[1989.06 - 1993.32] the good things they're doing get
[1991.10 - 1996.14] outweighed by the bad there's a constant
[1993.32 - 1998.96] tug and pull so if you're not if you're
[1996.14 - 2001.06] not that sick you won't notice so the
[1998.96 - 2002.80] point goes like this if you're not a
[2001.06 - 2004.12] sick person like really sick and really
[2002.80 - 2006.52] chronically sick you're not going to
[2004.12 - 2009.28] notice while you do all the bad things
[2006.52 - 2011.50] but if you're really sick you'll notice
[2009.28 - 2013.72] it or it'll just tank you and you don't
[2011.50 - 2016.98] won't know what it was
[2013.72 - 2016.98] that's important to know
[2021.82 - 2025.66] and here's another thing too It's tricky
[2024.22 - 2027.40] because you'll see somebody out there
[2025.66 - 2029.94] say oh diatomaceous earth particles
[2027.40 - 2029.94] helped me
[2030.28 - 2033.16] and then it destroys a whole bunch of
[2032.02 - 2035.26] lives
[2033.16 - 2036.94] like diatomaceous earth particles it
[2035.26 - 2040.12] helped me
[2036.94 - 2043.12] and then you got 56 people that hear
[2040.12 - 2044.68] that they go take it and now they're on
[2043.12 - 2046.90] mattress Island and they're stuck on
[2044.68 - 2049.36] mattress Island but who cares
[2046.90 - 2052.48] who cares right
[2049.36 - 2055.06] like who cares that's how it works it
[2052.48 - 2057.82] doesn't matter if like 50 people
[2055.06 - 2059.50] ended up like taking the wrong zeolite
[2057.82 - 2061.30] or too much zeolite or whatever it is or
[2059.50 - 2062.80] you got you got 50 people doing
[2061.30 - 2064.66] diatomaceous earth particles and
[2062.80 - 2066.46] chlorella you got people doing charcoal
[2064.66 - 2068.32] who cares if they get too sick and
[2066.46 - 2071.02] they're just battling chronic illness
[2068.32 - 2073.72] for the next 20 years in their life or
[2071.02 - 2076.66] they're injured by it who cares and
[2073.72 - 2079.42] that's how it works out there
[2076.66 - 2081.40] it was my experience my experience was
[2079.42 - 2084.22] diatomaceous earth made me feel better
[2081.40 - 2085.84] 50 people hear that and they go down in
[2084.22 - 2087.96] tank
[2085.84 - 2087.96] thank you
[2089.50 - 2093.64] all right so you know and that's just
[2092.02 - 2096.46] the way it works
[2093.64 - 2098.80] and it's sad there's a lot of yeah melt
[2096.46 - 2101.08] them you said so many pitfalls out there
[2098.80 - 2103.36] so true
[2101.08 - 2104.62] so true
[2103.36 - 2106.14] so
[2104.62 - 2108.76] let's go into
[2106.14 - 2110.38] mildly problematic supplements I have so
[2108.76 - 2112.36] many in here to talk about
[2110.38 - 2115.12] and the thing is you guys
[2112.36 - 2117.34] when that person tanks down the road and
[2115.12 - 2120.34] they get sick or sicker
[2117.34 - 2123.34] they took kind of a
[2120.34 - 2126.94] bunch of people went down there before
[2123.34 - 2129.16] that it's like it's like this it's
[2126.94 - 2131.80] when someone is actually
[2129.16 - 2133.96] like saying hey I diatomaceous earth
[2131.80 - 2136.00] particles worked with me chlorella
[2133.96 - 2137.68] worked with me no one knows about that
[2136.00 - 2140.20] person that took the chlorella or their
[2137.68 - 2142.36] child to chlorella and now they're so
[2140.20 - 2145.06] sick for years because they got the
[2142.36 - 2147.10] foodborne particles in their Chlorella
[2145.06 - 2148.66] or nobody knows about the diatomaceous
[2147.10 - 2150.46] earth particles that gave them such a
[2148.66 - 2151.72] flare that they were now bedridden for
[2150.46 - 2154.36] two years
[2151.72 - 2157.00] nobody knows about that person who took
[2154.36 - 2158.98] the charcoal and their intestinal lining
[2157.00 - 2160.78] suffocated and they couldn't get
[2158.98 - 2162.52] nutrients and they became so nutrient
[2160.78 - 2164.62] deficient that they lost their lives
[2162.52 - 2166.54] practically down the road but no one
[2164.62 - 2169.30] cares or sees any of that they don't see
[2166.54 - 2171.70] that history or anything but that one
[2169.30 - 2173.14] sales rep or that one person's like our
[2171.70 - 2175.42] charcoal's the greatest take it
[2173.14 - 2177.16] internally it gets out metals and all
[2175.42 - 2178.66] this crap they say
[2177.16 - 2181.06] and
[2178.66 - 2182.98] you know oh it does get Metals well
[2181.06 - 2184.66] didn't get charcoal wasn't used for
[2182.98 - 2186.16] getting Metals out years ago when it
[2184.66 - 2187.90] came out on the scene until medical
[2186.16 - 2189.16] medium talked about metals and then all
[2187.90 - 2192.66] of a sudden the sales reps are like oh
[2189.16 - 2192.66] yeah no it takes care of metals too
[2193.18 - 2199.66] the scams are just abundant
[2196.96 - 2201.28] so I'm in a section here of mildly
[2199.66 - 2203.26] problematic supplements if you guys just
[2201.28 - 2205.36] got here the brand saver books isn't
[2203.26 - 2207.82] just this this is one tiny little micro
[2205.36 - 2212.38] section out of the brain saver books I
[2207.82 - 2215.50] want you to know this is just a tiny bit
[2212.38 - 2218.28] okay mildly mildly problematic
[2215.50 - 2218.28] supplements
[2219.40 - 2223.24] all right
[2220.78 - 2226.36] let's go into
[2223.24 - 2228.28] herbal combination powders I'd like to
[2226.36 - 2231.04] go into that a little bit
[2228.28 - 2233.14] so herbal combination powders herbal
[2231.04 - 2234.88] combinations that are low quality often
[2233.14 - 2237.34] containing toxic heavy metals and what
[2234.88 - 2239.20] people don't realize is powders in the
[2237.34 - 2242.26] health Movement Like herbal powder
[2239.20 - 2244.18] combinations really loaded with Metals
[2242.26 - 2246.40] but really off the chart
[2244.18 - 2248.74] often containing toxic heavy metals
[2246.40 - 2251.74] often these herbal combination powders
[2248.74 - 2254.14] contain non-verbal additives such as
[2251.74 - 2256.72] Clays and probiotics that can either
[2254.14 - 2258.64] irritate the gastrointestinal Linings or
[2256.72 - 2261.22] just not be beneficial to the brain and
[2258.64 - 2262.60] body so herbal combination powders that
[2261.22 - 2263.56] have a little bit of this in it a little
[2262.60 - 2265.38] bit of that and a little bit of
[2263.56 - 2268.96] Bentonite a little bit of another clay
[2265.38 - 2271.42] and a little bit of probiotic
[2268.96 - 2275.22] they're really irritants
[2271.42 - 2275.22] but they don't offer anything
[2275.26 - 2279.22] the herbs that are chosen are not for
[2277.66 - 2281.50] specific conditions and symptoms so
[2279.22 - 2283.36] remember that every time there's an
[2281.50 - 2285.76] herbal powder out there
[2283.36 - 2287.68] it's never chosen as a blend for really
[2285.76 - 2290.10] any specific symptoms or conditions or
[2287.68 - 2292.60] really why or what it's thrown together
[2290.10 - 2295.06] as a business
[2292.60 - 2298.24] a business kind of
[2295.06 - 2301.48] direction or intention always thrown
[2298.24 - 2303.46] together of like what's easiest to find
[2301.48 - 2304.54] the cheapest to find throw it all
[2303.46 - 2307.24] together
[2304.54 - 2310.18] and just put it out there
[2307.24 - 2312.16] the herbs chosen are hit and miss so the
[2310.18 - 2314.02] herbs in these herbal powders that
[2312.16 - 2315.76] people actually consume and mix and
[2314.02 - 2317.92] consume out there are all hit and miss
[2315.76 - 2320.74] including in the capsules
[2317.92 - 2323.26] it's not in enough quantity it was
[2320.74 - 2324.82] someone stole this and poached this from
[2323.26 - 2327.58] medical medium recently I couldn't
[2324.82 - 2329.02] believe it like some I guess doctor dude
[2327.58 - 2331.12] or somebody
[2329.02 - 2333.58] um on social media
[2331.12 - 2336.64] the only place you heard this one line
[2333.58 - 2339.88] was from mm info published first talked
[2336.64 - 2343.36] about first and here it is
[2339.88 - 2345.76] the in these supplements they take only
[2343.36 - 2347.80] specs and they put all the specs
[2345.76 - 2349.84] together and then they lump it all into
[2347.80 - 2352.36] one supplement but you have like 20 30
[2349.84 - 2355.30] 40 things in there
[2352.36 - 2357.04] so even if there is an herb that can be
[2355.30 - 2359.20] helpful for a condition so you've read
[2357.04 - 2361.96] your supplement you read your your
[2359.20 - 2363.64] herbal powders combination powders and
[2361.96 - 2364.90] you say oh that herb is said to be
[2363.64 - 2367.12] pretty good
[2364.90 - 2369.22] it's not in enough quantity because it's
[2367.12 - 2371.68] merely a smidgen of the herb mixed with
[2369.22 - 2374.32] a dozen or more other herbs or additives
[2371.68 - 2376.36] that was literally poached from Doctor
[2374.32 - 2378.94] without citing it back to me
[2376.36 - 2380.68] some dude on social media the poaching's
[2378.94 - 2383.62] real it's Non-Stop
[2380.68 - 2386.20] a supplement brand took it
[2383.62 - 2389.38] and it had some health Guru doctor guy
[2386.20 - 2391.84] on a podcast talking about it but they
[2389.38 - 2393.64] took that so it's amazing how supplement
[2391.84 - 2395.56] Brands out there will take medical meme
[2393.64 - 2397.12] information and use it against the
[2395.56 - 2398.44] people when they're the ones doing
[2397.12 - 2400.90] exactly what the medical meme
[2398.44 - 2404.34] information is saying is bad
[2400.90 - 2404.34] and then they put it on an ad
[2404.38 - 2408.34] all right let's find another one too see
[2406.72 - 2409.48] pine needle tea I'm not gonna read that
[2408.34 - 2411.34] one on here
[2409.48 - 2414.10] not going to read about pine needle t on
[2411.34 - 2416.08] here cold like spring I hear pieces of
[2414.10 - 2419.44] your info everywhere is it driving you
[2416.08 - 2421.48] crazy yet May right because it's pretty
[2419.44 - 2423.28] much yeah
[2421.48 - 2425.74] I hear pieces of your info everywhere
[2423.28 - 2427.60] now they even say mystery weight gain
[2425.74 - 2429.52] can be connected to the liver they never
[2427.60 - 2431.86] knew the liver had anything to do with
[2429.52 - 2434.32] weight gain published first by medical
[2431.86 - 2436.12] medium and now used on ads too by
[2434.32 - 2438.94] doctors and they don't even have a study
[2436.12 - 2440.32] to be published around it they only have
[2438.94 - 2442.30] the medical medium books but they
[2440.32 - 2444.52] they're all doing it illegally by the
[2442.30 - 2447.82] way mate it's all illegal it's just that
[2444.52 - 2450.04] I have a choice to make do I go after
[2447.82 - 2451.78] everybody out there that's doing the
[2450.04 - 2452.62] most hideous things like that corrupted
[2451.78 - 2455.44] things
[2452.62 - 2457.60] or do which will take all my time or do
[2455.44 - 2460.42] I still do I spend all my time putting
[2457.60 - 2462.46] out answers and free information day in
[2460.42 - 2464.14] and day out I can choose one or the
[2462.46 - 2465.64] other you can't do both so I choose
[2464.14 - 2467.80] making sure I keep on giving you guys
[2465.64 - 2469.66] information whenever you hear stagnant
[2467.80 - 2472.18] sluggish overburdened liver it's medical
[2469.66 - 2474.46] medium terms and now doctors are using
[2472.18 - 2476.46] it it's everywhere stagnant overburdened
[2474.46 - 2480.70] whoever knew a stagnant overburden what
[2476.46 - 2483.30] liver all mm terms
[2480.70 - 2483.30] yeah
[2483.64 - 2489.40] so
[2485.80 - 2492.70] I mean my mildly problematic supplements
[2489.40 - 2494.86] right here here's neem oil neem oil is a
[2492.70 - 2496.96] big one right how many people took neem
[2494.86 - 2499.14] oil how about that one so I got it in
[2496.96 - 2499.14] here
[2500.26 - 2504.46] it's I don't have a lot written on it
[2502.12 - 2508.24] it's just avoid taking neem oil
[2504.46 - 2510.76] internally it's too astringent
[2508.24 - 2512.74] it's too astringent if you're even
[2510.76 - 2514.72] sensitive you're going to be struggling
[2512.74 - 2517.36] from that one
[2514.72 - 2519.34] its chemical compounds are aggressive on
[2517.36 - 2520.36] the stomach and intestinal lining so in
[2519.34 - 2522.70] neem oil
[2520.36 - 2524.62] it's a stringent chemical compounds are
[2522.70 - 2526.66] not fit for being internal for the human
[2524.62 - 2527.86] body and a lot of people get in trouble
[2526.66 - 2530.14] because of that when they take their
[2527.86 - 2531.76] neem oil but they don't even know it and
[2530.14 - 2533.62] then they'll blame something else like
[2531.76 - 2535.12] the Apple they ate and someone will say
[2533.62 - 2536.62] well you're not allowed to eat fruit
[2535.12 - 2538.60] you're fruit sensitive meanwhile it's
[2536.62 - 2540.84] the neem oil that's just ruining their
[2538.60 - 2540.84] gut
[2541.42 - 2545.38] because of this neem is also an irritant
[2544.00 - 2546.82] to the vagus nerve so here's what I
[2545.38 - 2548.80] don't like about neem oil and I never
[2546.82 - 2551.86] did you'll hear me never talk about or
[2548.80 - 2554.86] promote neem oil neem oil is a massive
[2551.86 - 2556.60] irritant to the vagus nerves
[2554.86 - 2558.88] Vegas nerves were tightness of the
[2556.60 - 2561.22] throat kinds of the chest anxiety Panic
[2558.88 - 2566.46] all these different issues but it's a
[2561.22 - 2566.46] big big irritant to the vagus nerves and
[2568.68 - 2573.10] now you'll see out there because of mm
[2571.72 - 2576.34] info again you'll see a lot of people
[2573.10 - 2577.78] they're now Vegas they're experts even
[2576.34 - 2580.12] though there's no science behind any of
[2577.78 - 2581.32] it so where do they get their info that
[2580.12 - 2582.10] they're talking about
[2581.32 - 2583.66] um
[2582.10 - 2585.52] did they talk to Spirit of compassion
[2583.66 - 2587.62] too because I'm confused about that one
[2585.52 - 2590.68] so all these decades I put vagus nerve
[2587.62 - 2593.44] information out there and the Vegas
[2590.68 - 2595.72] nurse react to real astringent
[2593.44 - 2597.28] properties like the kind that aren't
[2595.72 - 2599.98] like I'm not talking about like food
[2597.28 - 2602.32] like like some blueberries or something
[2599.98 - 2605.32] like that I'm not talking about
[2602.32 - 2607.84] um a grape okay and even grapes grapes
[2605.32 - 2610.30] some grapes can be so tart that they're
[2607.84 - 2613.24] too intense right if you eat too many of
[2610.30 - 2616.18] them but the point is is that the vagus
[2613.24 - 2618.52] nerves are hypersensitive to astringent
[2616.18 - 2621.94] astringent properties
[2618.52 - 2623.68] and neem oil lights up the Vegas nerves
[2621.94 - 2626.32] not to heal it it doesn't light up the
[2623.68 - 2629.26] vagus nerves to heal the vagus nerves
[2626.32 - 2631.78] neem oil creates a situation where it
[2629.26 - 2634.12] increases anxiety it increases ticks and
[2631.78 - 2635.56] spasms it increases digestive system
[2634.12 - 2637.36] discomfort and all that and how many of
[2635.56 - 2639.82] you guys have tried the whole neem oil
[2637.36 - 2641.68] cold white spring many are wondering
[2639.82 - 2643.72] about CBD oil I talk about it in the
[2641.68 - 2647.02] brain saver book
[2643.72 - 2647.92] I just don't want I just don't want
[2647.02 - 2651.40] um
[2647.92 - 2654.76] the pitchforks and the Torches and the
[2651.40 - 2656.32] uh shovels and the bats with nails on
[2654.76 - 2658.60] the end of them I just don't want to get
[2656.32 - 2660.34] too bad of a beating or slashing today
[2658.60 - 2663.04] so I'm not going to talk about the CBD
[2660.34 - 2664.42] oil but it's in the books it's in the
[2663.04 - 2668.02] book
[2664.42 - 2671.56] so the vagus nerve is definitely
[2668.02 - 2673.60] okay I will say this about CBD oil
[2671.56 - 2674.80] you'll notice something it's not CBD oil
[2673.60 - 2676.90] anymore
[2674.80 - 2679.84] it's CBD oil mixed with all this medical
[2676.90 - 2682.72] medium stuff why is that happening
[2679.84 - 2684.76] uh for years uh you know like
[2682.72 - 2687.52] everybody's had CBD oil to be a miracle
[2684.76 - 2691.48] I'm not judging anybody
[2687.52 - 2694.06] but then because CBD oil wasn't fixing
[2691.48 - 2695.80] everybody they started putting like the
[2694.06 - 2698.44] lemon balm and all the medical medium
[2695.80 - 2700.24] tools in the CBD oil so now the CBD oils
[2698.44 - 2703.48] have all the medical medium stuff in it
[2700.24 - 2706.06] how weird is that why
[2703.48 - 2708.16] because I haven't been promoting CBD oil
[2706.06 - 2710.50] all these years because when
[2708.16 - 2713.32] I had somebody come to me and they'd be
[2710.50 - 2715.78] like well the CB oil is not working
[2713.32 - 2718.18] uh I would have to say well we got to
[2715.78 - 2719.92] get you on lemon balm a friend or
[2718.18 - 2721.24] whatever or a loved one you have to get
[2719.92 - 2724.06] you out of the lemon bottle oh my God
[2721.24 - 2725.50] the lemon balm's working and so but the
[2724.06 - 2728.02] point is is I get it a lot of you guys
[2725.50 - 2730.42] love your CBD oil I'm not harping on
[2728.02 - 2732.22] that I'm just saying that it's changing
[2730.42 - 2733.78] in about a couple of years you're not
[2732.22 - 2736.24] going to be able to get straight CBD oil
[2733.78 - 2739.24] it's going to be CBD CBD oil with all
[2736.24 - 2741.16] the medical medium tools mixed in it
[2739.24 - 2743.14] you're not going to have straight CBD
[2741.16 - 2745.36] oil in a few years I'm letting you know
[2743.14 - 2746.92] it's all going to have lemon balm in it
[2745.36 - 2748.42] and all the other stuff that's in the
[2746.92 - 2751.24] brain saver books in the other books
[2748.42 - 2753.22] original medical medium information it's
[2751.24 - 2756.16] really Advanced about the vagus nerves
[2753.22 - 2758.14] too what I'm talking about so just so
[2756.16 - 2760.42] you know in these books
[2758.14 - 2762.88] I go into advanced information about the
[2760.42 - 2765.22] vagus nerves stuff I've never talked
[2762.88 - 2768.58] about before are in here
[2765.22 - 2770.50] original mm info is Vegas nerve
[2768.58 - 2773.08] inflammation nobody knew Vegas nerves
[2770.50 - 2775.30] got inflamed nobody knew you got mystery
[2773.08 - 2777.16] nausea from vagus nerves that's mm info
[2775.30 - 2779.20] nobody knew you vomited because of a
[2777.16 - 2780.34] vagus nerve inflammation nobody knew you
[2779.20 - 2782.68] had anxiety because of your
[2780.34 - 2784.60] gastroparesis
[2782.68 - 2786.58] they didn't know why someone had
[2784.60 - 2788.68] gastroparesis
[2786.58 - 2789.88] um so Matt neem talked about the vagus
[2788.68 - 2793.54] nerves creating all these different
[2789.88 - 2794.62] symptoms and now once again they poached
[2793.54 - 2796.96] them
[2794.62 - 2799.06] it gets old man gets old but you just do
[2796.96 - 2802.68] one thing you know one thing in time so
[2799.06 - 2802.68] CBD I talk about it in here
[2803.08 - 2806.50] so get ready
[2804.40 - 2808.90] let's talk a little bit about CBD for a
[2806.50 - 2812.82] second here most chronic illnesses are
[2808.90 - 2812.82] caused by pathogens and toxins
[2813.16 - 2818.44] this is in the CBD section
[2815.86 - 2820.66] most chronic illnesses are caused by
[2818.44 - 2822.52] pathogens and toxins
[2820.66 - 2825.76] science and research
[2822.52 - 2828.16] and doctors did not know this
[2825.76 - 2829.66] it's originally mm info and published
[2828.16 - 2831.34] going all the way back
[2829.66 - 2834.46] chronic illnesses are caused by
[2831.34 - 2837.82] pathogens and toxins
[2834.46 - 2840.22] CBD is neither antiviral
[2837.82 - 2841.12] nor detoxifying so I just want to say
[2840.22 - 2845.26] this
[2841.12 - 2847.30] not trying to cause any riffs you guys I
[2845.26 - 2850.42] don't want you to dislike me more than
[2847.30 - 2852.52] you might already or whatever
[2850.42 - 2858.46] CBD oil
[2852.52 - 2860.20] is not antiviral nor is it detoxifying
[2858.46 - 2863.50] but get this
[2860.20 - 2866.76] everybody's taking CBD oil
[2863.50 - 2866.76] because they're sick
[2866.98 - 2871.96] it's not something you want you go out
[2868.96 - 2874.00] and take when you're not sick
[2871.96 - 2877.48] when you don't have a single symptom or
[2874.00 - 2880.78] a problem you just don't rush
[2877.48 - 2883.30] to somebody and grab some CBD oil if
[2880.78 - 2886.00] you're not sick with any symptoms you're
[2883.30 - 2887.74] getting your CBD oil because you have a
[2886.00 - 2890.02] symptom of some kind that's why you're
[2887.74 - 2891.88] going to buy your CBD oil hey try CBD
[2890.02 - 2893.44] oil worked for me okay good I'll go get
[2891.88 - 2895.36] it I have anxiety I got this I got that
[2893.44 - 2897.34] that's why you're taking CBD oil right
[2895.36 - 2900.88] you have a symptom
[2897.34 - 2904.00] but but your symptoms are caused by
[2900.88 - 2906.40] pathogens and toxins unless it's some
[2904.00 - 2908.74] serious emotional struggle which still
[2906.40 - 2910.90] could have toxins like Metals involved
[2908.74 - 2913.20] so your symptoms are caused by pathogens
[2910.90 - 2916.90] and toxins get ready
[2913.20 - 2918.64] CBD oil is neither antiviral
[2916.90 - 2922.12] anti-pathogen
[2918.64 - 2924.16] or detoxifying of the toxins and poisons
[2922.12 - 2926.94] I'm giving you just a little bit of a
[2924.16 - 2926.94] precursor
[2927.52 - 2930.94] and we're going to talk about the brain
[2929.50 - 2932.38] shot therapy cleanse challenge that's
[2930.94 - 2934.90] coming up too
[2932.38 - 2937.60] so
[2934.90 - 2941.62] so get get ready for this one
[2937.60 - 2944.38] in the past CBD oil was commonly sold as
[2941.62 - 2946.90] a treatment on its own
[2944.38 - 2949.78] you can only buy CBD oil
[2946.90 - 2951.46] that's CBD oil
[2949.78 - 2954.46] okay
[2951.46 - 2956.50] the lack of results with CBD oil
[2954.46 - 2959.02] Jackie V says I took it for anxiety I
[2956.50 - 2960.88] stopped using it after I found MN that's
[2959.02 - 2963.46] amazing that's incredible a lot of
[2960.88 - 2966.72] people have have gone through that
[2963.46 - 2969.76] get this the lack of results with CBD
[2966.72 - 2973.42] then spurred on a change with its usage
[2969.76 - 2976.00] by the way you guys bait and switch
[2973.42 - 2979.18] the chronically ill
[2976.00 - 2981.76] Get Fooled by the bait and switch
[2979.18 - 2984.46] the system out there are all think
[2981.76 - 2986.44] tanking about you guys anyone who's sick
[2984.46 - 2989.08] with a chronic symptom condition because
[2986.44 - 2990.04] you guys are the money makers for the
[2989.08 - 2992.80] system
[2990.04 - 2994.48] right because when you get sick you got
[2992.80 - 2996.70] to pay for everything right you're sick
[2994.48 - 2999.04] you got to look for answers whatever so
[2996.70 - 3001.38] the system is set up like this
[2999.04 - 3003.54] and if you say well you're selling a
[3001.38 - 3005.22] book well I'm not selling a course
[3003.54 - 3007.56] for five thousand dollars and I'm not
[3005.22 - 3010.32] withholding the information and
[3007.56 - 3011.94] wait until they come out in the library
[3010.32 - 3013.74] go ask your library when you get a
[3011.94 - 3016.26] chance I'm trying to get it in some
[3013.74 - 3019.32] libraries and get it take it out for
[3016.26 - 3021.72] free don't pay for it go to the library
[3019.32 - 3024.54] but the system set up
[3021.72 - 3027.24] because the system's rigged
[3024.54 - 3029.28] and here's how it works the bait and
[3027.24 - 3031.56] switch is happening with CBD oil right
[3029.28 - 3034.38] now as we speak
[3031.56 - 3036.30] the lack of results from CBD oil spurred
[3034.38 - 3039.72] on a change with its usage
[3036.30 - 3043.56] right now CBD oil is changing
[3039.72 - 3046.14] the strategy for CBD has evolved
[3043.56 - 3048.30] and CBD is now being sold mixed with
[3046.14 - 3049.98] other medicinals such as herbs vitamins
[3048.30 - 3052.20] and nutrients
[3049.98 - 3053.28] that offer better results medical medium
[3052.20 - 3056.22] info
[3053.28 - 3059.04] hasea says lemon balm has changed my
[3056.22 - 3061.38] life I used to have panic attacks every
[3059.04 - 3063.90] single night I used to use CBD as well
[3061.38 - 3065.52] never did anything lemon balm heals yay
[3063.90 - 3069.30] well that's what I heard my whole life
[3065.52 - 3071.88] that CBD CBD never did anything
[3069.30 - 3074.64] I never recommended it once to anyone
[3071.88 - 3078.26] CBD oil I still won't till today because
[3074.64 - 3078.26] there's better things out there
[3079.56 - 3084.42] I'm not anti-cbd if someone wants to
[3082.68 - 3086.28] partake in it it's like that's up to
[3084.42 - 3087.18] them that's their life you do what you
[3086.28 - 3089.82] want
[3087.18 - 3093.06] but get ready they have to add things
[3089.82 - 3095.28] that actually work in CBD now it's a
[3093.06 - 3097.14] bait and switch like lemon balm they're
[3095.28 - 3098.94] taking lemon balm which really does help
[3097.14 - 3102.42] people in their problems and they're
[3098.94 - 3105.78] adding it to the CBD oil right now
[3102.42 - 3107.34] it's a bait and switch once again but
[3105.78 - 3110.12] they're taking lemon balm because of
[3107.34 - 3110.12] medical medium
[3110.40 - 3116.94] also CBD oil is really expensive
[3113.88 - 3119.28] the strategy for CBD has evolved and CBD
[3116.94 - 3122.40] is now being sold mixed in with other
[3119.28 - 3124.44] medicinals such as herbs vitamins and
[3122.40 - 3127.68] nutrients that offer better results for
[3124.44 - 3130.80] individuals living with various symptoms
[3127.68 - 3133.50] this can be misleading for CBD users
[3130.80 - 3135.24] because CBD gets the spotlight so here's
[3133.50 - 3137.22] how it works here's how they really
[3135.24 - 3140.28] screw everybody over
[3137.22 - 3142.80] they sell you expensive CBD
[3140.28 - 3144.90] it doesn't work they found that out for
[3142.80 - 3146.16] years now so now they're looking to
[3144.90 - 3148.92] Medical medium
[3146.16 - 3150.42] like like lemon balm exploded in the
[3148.92 - 3154.86] world because of medical medium books
[3150.42 - 3158.52] and information exploded right now
[3154.86 - 3160.94] and if you eat best lemon balm ever is
[3158.52 - 3166.64] is on my directory by the way
[3160.94 - 3166.64] medicalme.com so lemon balm exploded
[3166.74 - 3171.60] and now
[3168.42 - 3173.10] they're like okay well we're seeing that
[3171.60 - 3175.86] medical median people are getting better
[3173.10 - 3179.06] with lemon balm let's take lemon balm
[3175.86 - 3179.06] and mix it with their CBD
[3180.00 - 3184.98] but they don't ever come clean and say
[3183.06 - 3186.84] we're gonna make an announcement and
[3184.98 - 3190.64] we're sorry that we totally screwed you
[3186.84 - 3190.64] over for the last two generations
[3192.48 - 3196.38] and we were really just confused and
[3194.64 - 3198.30] didn't know it didn't work
[3196.38 - 3199.98] so now we have to put things in that are
[3198.30 - 3202.02] medical mediums and actually put it in
[3199.98 - 3204.30] make it work nobody comes clean and Fest
[3202.02 - 3207.18] us up
[3204.30 - 3210.06] this can be misleading for CBD users
[3207.18 - 3211.56] because CBD gets the spotlight
[3210.06 - 3213.66] and then they'll say once you start
[3211.56 - 3216.12] feeling better by having your lemon balm
[3213.66 - 3217.98] in your CBD oil they'll say oh it was
[3216.12 - 3221.04] the CBD
[3217.98 - 3222.54] while it's the other constituents in the
[3221.04 - 3224.82] combinations that are providing more

[3304.26 - 3308.04] medical mean and brain shot therapy
[3306.12 - 3309.72] offers instant relief while you're

[3309.72 - 3313.68] level with your brain and nervous system
[3311.76 - 3315.78] now instant relief I have to give you
[3313.68 - 3317.52] forewarning it's going to catch you off

[3325.14 - 3328.26] I'm trying to give you that little
[3326.22 - 3331.34] disclaimer like just be prepared I feel
[3328.26 - 3331.34] like I have to do that
[3331.74 - 3335.70] your brain and body have a quick
[3333.84 - 3338.40] response to medicinals delivered in
[3335.70 - 3340.46] liquid form what I call a shot designed
[3338.40 - 3342.60] to be highly absorbable in the mouth
[3340.46 - 3345.06] these brain shots there's a lot of words
[3342.60 - 3346.98] at once these brain shots valuable
[3345.06 - 3348.96] healing components can reach the brain
[3346.98 - 3353.94] fast so here's how it works
[3348.96 - 3356.22] these brain shots reach the brain quick
[3353.94 - 3358.14] these specially formulated shots have
[3356.22 - 3360.06] the ability to reset and rewire the
[3358.14 - 3361.86] brain and that's why they're so powerful
[3360.06 - 3364.08] because they have that ability to reset
[3361.86 - 3366.36] and rewire the brain to shock it out of
[3364.08 - 3369.72] patterns while at the same time reducing
[3366.36 - 3371.70] triggers reducing triggers
[3369.72 - 3373.08] that's what's incredible about it so
[3371.70 - 3374.46] let's give you the list of shots here

[3374.46 - 3379.44] of look like right

[3386.28 - 3392.42] about it about when best to use it all
[3389.16 - 3392.42] of that so

[3431.82 - 3436.68] so what happens is that people out there
[3434.46 - 3438.60] the trolls the haters and naysators
[3436.68 - 3440.94] Sayers are just going to be always like

[3448.38 - 3453.00] All the Rules like truly Breaking All
[3450.72 - 3455.10] the Rules if you ever have ever seen any
[3453.00 - 3457.56] other health communities
[3455.10 - 3459.72] people say they're they they get a
[3457.56 - 3461.64] little better sometimes but then they
[3459.72 - 3463.80] just disappear and they're far worse
[3461.64 - 3465.42] than they ever were and you'll notice
[3463.80 - 3466.74] that the rate of people getting better
[3465.42 - 3468.36] at all the other communities doesn't
[3466.74 - 3470.34] happen they just all stay sick
[3468.36 - 3472.04] completely like all of them stay sick
[3470.34 - 3475.56] for the most part
[3472.04 - 3477.90] and they stay all sick and they stay all
[3475.56 - 3480.38] Angry like if you go into some of the
[3477.90 - 3483.00] different communities out there
[3480.38 - 3484.74] and some of the different socials out
[3483.00 - 3487.08] there with the different kind of things
[3484.74 - 3488.22] like the like Hashimoto's or autoimmune
[3487.08 - 3491.94] and some of the different socials out
[3488.22 - 3494.04] there they're all angry they're so angry
[3491.94 - 3495.06] they're sick they're angry they're
[3494.04 - 3497.76] scammed
[3495.06 - 3500.16] it's just they're just done wrong it's
[3497.76 - 3502.32] just terrible and
[3500.16 - 3505.62] people fight
[3502.32 - 3506.76] they fight you on thinking you know they
[3505.62 - 3508.56] fight you on thinking you can just
[3506.76 - 3510.36] manage your conditions and symptoms but
[3508.56 - 3512.88] you actually can heal they're just all
[3510.36 - 3514.98] about managing out there and you
[3512.88 - 3516.90] actually can heal
[3514.98 - 3518.34] so they'll just like fight you on things
[3516.90 - 3520.68] and tools to manage your condition
[3518.34 - 3522.42] medical meme info is done about managing
[3520.68 - 3523.86] it's about moving forward and getting
[3522.42 - 3524.82] better so we're in the brain shots right
[3523.86 - 3526.44] here instead of just cutting through
[3524.82 - 3527.58] some of them that's the mold exposure
[3526.44 - 3529.62] shot
[3527.58 - 3531.36] SOC is going to pick out a bunch of
[3529.62 - 3533.52] shots

[3534.84 - 3537.36] shot
[3535.62 - 3538.92] therapy challenge

[3538.92 - 3544.14] it's gonna be fun
[3541.86 - 3545.64] I'm really excited about this make sure
[3544.14 - 3548.36] you sign up to my email that's the mold
[3545.64 - 3552.42] exposure shot that's the EMF and 5G
[3548.36 - 3553.80] exposure shot love that shot I love that
[3552.42 - 3555.72] shot
[3553.80 - 3558.36] just love it
[3555.72 - 3559.38] radiation exposure shot every time I
[3558.36 - 3562.50] travel
[3559.38 - 3566.70] every time I travel boom I'm doing that
[3562.50 - 3569.22] shot boom boom boom every time I travel
[3566.70 - 3571.38] every time I fly and I'm glowing in the
[3569.22 - 3574.02] dark after I fly
[3571.38 - 3575.52] it doesn't go away when you fly you got
[3574.02 - 3578.22] the radiation and you still from 10
[3575.52 - 3580.08] years ago it doesn't go away maybe if
[3578.22 - 3582.24] you're doing like active medical medium
[3580.08 - 3584.22] tools to get it to go away but if you
[3582.24 - 3586.32] don't do that radiation just sits in you
[3584.22 - 3587.76] you glow in the dark until you die down
[3586.32 - 3589.80] the road it's like you just glow in the
[3587.76 - 3591.78] dark every plane flight you just get
[3589.80 - 3594.60] more radiation and more rain then they
[3591.78 - 3597.00] make you go through those scanners
[3594.60 - 3599.76] go with the pat down
[3597.00 - 3602.34] I would never go through the scanner
[3599.76 - 3605.10] Janet Rose I agree with most of what you
[3602.34 - 3608.64] said about CBD oils on the market I've
[3605.10 - 3610.86] tried one from the from the flower in an
[3608.64 - 3613.32] alcohol base for delivery via drops on
[3610.86 - 3615.30] the tongue and it works fine expensive
[3613.32 - 3618.30] though you're getting the alcohol hit
[3615.30 - 3619.80] it's sorry
[3618.30 - 3622.44] sorry
[3619.80 - 3624.24] you're just getting the alcohol hit if I
[3622.44 - 3626.64] walked around with grain alcohol and
[3624.24 - 3629.04] dropped it on my tongue all day long I
[3626.64 - 3631.32] feel pretty damn fine too
[3629.04 - 3633.42] that's how sad that is
[3631.32 - 3635.90] it's like you know
[3633.42 - 3635.90] it's like
[3636.66 - 3642.18] I got this new CBD oil right here and
[3640.44 - 3644.66] I'm just gonna take a little bit of a
[3642.18 - 3644.66] hit now
[3648.30 - 3652.92] the grain alcohol getting into my system
[3650.40 - 3656.52] is just making me feel better
[3652.92 - 3659.10] that was nice it was a nice alcohol hit
[3656.52 - 3661.86] so once again you were doing like
[3659.10 - 3663.60] without realizing it I'm not I'm not
[3661.86 - 3665.04] being harsher look it's not about making
[3663.60 - 3667.62] fun or anything I want you to know this
[3665.04 - 3669.24] like thank you for being here I'm sorry
[3667.62 - 3671.70] if I'm irritating for real like if I'm
[3669.24 - 3673.62] irritating or snarky or sarcastic I'm
[3671.70 - 3675.36] really I apologize and I want you to
[3673.62 - 3677.10] know that like it's a true apology from
[3675.36 - 3679.80] my heart
[3677.10 - 3682.26] um but what happens is there's alcohol
[3679.80 - 3686.28] in that CBD that one
[3682.26 - 3689.16] and it's potent alcohol it's grain
[3686.28 - 3690.90] alcohol you're gonna get the grain
[3689.16 - 3693.12] alcohol hit and you're gonna think the
[3690.90 - 3694.92] CBD is working for you but it's the
[3693.12 - 3697.08] grain alcohol that you're getting a hit
[3694.92 - 3699.12] from it's calming you down but that's
[3697.08 - 3701.04] not good because that's a different
[3699.12 - 3703.08] thing that's something you don't want
[3701.04 - 3704.82] calming you down because it's been tried
[3703.08 - 3706.92] for hundreds of years and hundreds of
[3704.82 - 3708.96] years that's what men and women have
[3706.92 - 3711.12] done is drank themselves to death to
[3708.96 - 3712.68] calm themselves down and but you're not
[3711.12 - 3714.06] drinking yourself to death I get it
[3712.68 - 3715.98] you're just using a little bit of grain
[3714.06 - 3718.20] alcohol from your CBD but that's what's
[3715.98 - 3720.66] giving you the hit please know how it
[3718.20 - 3722.84] works so you understand
[3720.66 - 3722.84] foreign
[3723.02 - 3727.86] you gotta read the books about it
[3725.16 - 3729.24] alcohol is a whole other trick
[3727.86 - 3733.80] where am I
[3729.24 - 3739.40] here we are oh I am here
[3733.80 - 3739.40] Jen coffin says CBD did nothing for me
[3740.52 - 3744.92] toxic heavy metal exposure shot if you
[3742.80 - 3748.32] think you were exposed by
[3744.92 - 3750.36] Pharmaceuticals or anything else
[3748.32 - 3752.52] pesticide herbicide and fungicide
[3750.36 - 3754.38] exposure well why how would you have a
[3752.52 - 3755.40] fungicide exposure please tell me
[3754.38 - 3758.72] someone
[3755.40 - 3758.72] let me read to see
[3761.58 - 3768.12] this shot is an excellent tool when you
[3764.40 - 3769.86] inhale an unfamiliar or strange odor
[3768.12 - 3772.32] uh-huh
[3769.86 - 3774.90] you're exposed to recently delivered
[3772.32 - 3777.24] packages believe it or not recently
[3774.90 - 3779.22] delivered packages
[3777.24 - 3780.84] you gotta kind of like keep your nose
[3779.22 - 3782.70] away from them a little bit because the
[3780.84 - 3784.86] outside is usually contaminated with a
[3782.70 - 3787.14] lot of stuff until you get inside
[3784.86 - 3789.30] a neighbor sprays or treats their lawn
[3787.14 - 3790.80] with insecticide or chemical fertilizer
[3789.30 - 3792.36] treatment so if the neighbors spraying
[3790.80 - 3794.46] something which they always do or
[3792.36 - 3797.70] chemical treatments that are applied
[3794.46 - 3800.52] around an apartment building okay
[3797.70 - 3802.68] now I talk about okay here's another one
[3800.52 - 3805.14] right
[3802.68 - 3806.76] you're exposed to a town or city
[3805.14 - 3808.26] treatment that's occurring on the side
[3806.76 - 3809.64] of the street because the town and the
[3808.26 - 3812.10] cities are always spraying the most
[3809.64 - 3815.28] dangerous stuff they want to kill their
[3812.10 - 3817.38] people apparently not purposely entirely
[3815.28 - 3818.82] but there's a bigger industry that does
[3817.38 - 3821.10] want to kill people with all these
[3818.82 - 3823.68] chemicals above them
[3821.10 - 3826.86] you spot somebody with a tank on their
[3823.68 - 3829.62] back and a hose in their hand
[3826.86 - 3831.36] and they're spraying for weeds
[3829.62 - 3832.98] that's another one right there this is
[3831.36 - 3834.48] when you use the shot
[3832.98 - 3836.46] I mean no one's trying to kill anybody
[3834.48 - 3838.26] I'm just saying that the industries that
[3836.46 - 3841.08] create a lot of these chemicals
[3838.26 - 3843.24] definitely
[3841.08 - 3844.80] make people sick that's what I was
[3843.24 - 3847.08] saying
[3844.80 - 3849.12] you see a small to medium-sized truck
[3847.08 - 3851.16] with a large tank on the back and
[3849.12 - 3855.12] business signs on the side of that truck
[3851.16 - 3857.34] that say Lawn Care bug control or
[3855.12 - 3859.44] anything similar driving through your
[3857.34 - 3861.06] neighborhood meaning that chances are
[3859.44 - 3862.32] they just recently sprayed a bunch of
[3861.06 - 3863.88] different houses in your neighborhood
[3862.32 - 3865.26] and the wind's blowing it and you're
[3863.88 - 3867.42] exposed so then you get out your
[3865.26 - 3869.52] pesticide herbicide fungicide exposure
[3867.42 - 3871.92] shot check this out
[3869.52 - 3873.66] you're driving behind a truck that has a
[3871.92 - 3875.28] tank on the back with mysterious liquid
[3873.66 - 3876.66] leaking out of the tank I can't tell you
[3875.28 - 3878.52] how many times I've seen that over and
[3876.66 - 3881.28] over again and SOC told me when I was
[3878.52 - 3883.80] driving or in the car driving someone's
[3881.28 - 3886.08] driving that SSC told me that that tank
[3883.80 - 3887.76] is leaking deadly pesticides and it was
[3886.08 - 3889.98] just coming right out while you're
[3887.76 - 3893.46] driving behind it
[3889.98 - 3895.68] you spend time sitting in a park or
[3893.46 - 3898.20] visiting Parks or you spend time on a
[3895.68 - 3900.80] golf course right
[3898.20 - 3903.06] wish I had time to play golf
[3900.80 - 3906.36] insecticide treatments are sprayed in
[3903.06 - 3908.46] classrooms classrooms they spray the
[3906.36 - 3910.98] crap out of classrooms I know teachers
[3908.46 - 3912.84] say well that's not true aw some say it
[3910.98 - 3914.46] is true because they know a lot of
[3912.84 - 3916.92] teachers will say aw you know you're
[3914.46 - 3919.14] pushing it too far there's no pesticide
[3916.92 - 3920.64] sprays in my classroom uh there is over
[3919.14 - 3924.54] the summer time
[3920.64 - 3926.76] because I know I have a family member
[3924.54 - 3929.10] who works in maintenance at one of the
[3926.76 - 3932.88] schools and tells me that here's how it
[3929.10 - 3935.10] works that when summertime comes and all
[3932.88 - 3938.64] the teachers are gone students are out
[3935.10 - 3940.62] and it's summertime they gas bomb with
[3938.64 - 3943.20] pesticides insecticides the entire
[3940.62 - 3946.10] schools and the classrooms
[3943.20 - 3946.10] heavily
[3946.76 - 3951.90] insecticide treatments are sprayed in
[3948.96 - 3955.86] classrooms from preschools preschool
[3951.90 - 3958.86] to elementary schools to universities
[3955.86 - 3959.94] and in dorm rooms especially common at
[3958.86 - 3961.80] the beginning of the school year so
[3959.94 - 3963.66] before the kids come in they spray for
[3961.80 - 3966.54] all the roaches and spray for all the
[3963.66 - 3968.58] bed bugs and they spray the dorm rooms
[3966.54 - 3971.04] so when the kids come in they get so
[3968.58 - 3972.66] much toxic heavy metal exposure from
[3971.04 - 3974.76] pesticides inside of them and other
[3972.66 - 3976.80] things too like the pesticide exposure
[3974.76 - 3979.32] and funguside exposure it's crazy let's
[3976.80 - 3982.44] go to another one here you live within
[3979.32 - 3984.54] 25 miles of a conventional fruit or
[3982.44 - 3986.76] vegetable farm during its growing season
[3984.54 - 3988.86] so you could be living near a tomato
[3986.76 - 3990.00] Farm or something it's conventional and
[3988.86 - 3991.92] they'll spray
[3990.00 - 3993.96] you know that's that's a problem on its
[3991.92 - 3995.16] own
[3993.96 - 3997.62] okay

[4146.06 - 4152.90] you guys in free material 24 7.
[4149.06 - 4156.32] there's over 300 symptoms and conditions
[4152.90 - 4157.88] check them out also if you can leave a
[4156.32 - 4160.16] review
[4157.88 - 4163.58] Amazon.com or wherever you got the books
[4160.16 - 4165.92] or whatever please leave a review and
[4163.58 - 4169.16] how do you clean the books right you can
[4165.92 - 4170.60] take a hand towel this is a sponge
[4169.16 - 4172.64] sponge is probably not going to work
[4170.60 - 4174.14] unless it's just damp but you take a
[4172.64 - 4176.00] hand towel with a little bit of dish
[4174.14 - 4177.32] soap on it and you just clean it off you
[4176.00 - 4179.24] don't make it too wet because you don't
[4177.32 - 4180.98] want to soak your book and you clean off
[4179.24 - 4182.66] the grease from the conveyor belts that
[4180.98 - 4184.52] come from Amazon
[4182.66 - 4188.36] so here's how it works the books are
[4184.52 - 4190.94] minted they're pristine and clean and
[4188.36 - 4193.46] fresh and new and then they go to the
[4190.94 - 4195.74] warehouse at Amazon and then Amazon has
[4193.46 - 4197.30] conveyor belts that that there's grease
[4195.74 - 4199.88] on because they have to grease the
[4197.30 - 4201.68] conveyor belts and then the worker God
[4199.88 - 4204.38] bless their soul takes the medical
[4201.68 - 4206.66] medium book and they take it and they
[4204.38 - 4208.94] throw it on the conveyor belt rightfully
[4206.66 - 4211.22] so it's their job and the book is just
[4208.94 - 4213.44] rolling down the conveyor belts and then
[4211.22 - 4215.78] by the time it gets into the box it's
[4213.44 - 4218.12] got a grease much another smudge another
[4215.78 - 4221.12] smudge some dirt here and even some food
[4218.12 - 4222.62] on here for some you know person eating
[4221.12 - 4225.26] or whatever it is or drinking something
[4222.62 - 4227.30] and then ask for a new book if you don't
[4225.26 - 4230.30] like how it came ask Amazon for a new
[4227.30 - 4232.70] book or just clean it and the reason why
[4230.30 - 4235.16] I'm I'm saying this is because people
[4232.70 - 4238.22] then get mad at me and think I gave them
[4235.16 - 4239.72] a used book which is think that's think
[4238.22 - 4241.40] that's not true no they've done it and
[4239.72 - 4244.28] they've given me one stars because of it
[4241.40 - 4247.16] people also ask because I saw that
[4244.28 - 4248.90] before which book to do
[4247.16 - 4251.18] so which book
[4248.90 - 4253.22] which book
[4251.18 - 4255.44] ready I'm gonna land on the book to get
[4253.22 - 4258.32] I'm definitely gonna land right on the
[4255.44 - 4261.26] book that you have to get okay I want
[4258.32 - 4263.06] you to get the book that it lands on get
[4261.26 - 4265.46] ready which book is it gonna be first
[4263.06 - 4267.74] which But first you get both books is
[4265.46 - 4271.28] what you get first that's where we land
[4267.74 - 4273.14] because it's one book one gigantic book
[4271.28 - 4275.30] that the publisher could not publish and
[4273.14 - 4278.54] the printer could not print it's too big
[4275.30 - 4281.84] it's over 1200 Pages they're over 600
[4278.54 - 4284.30] Pages a piece and it's very heavy and
[4281.84 - 4287.84] the problem is the publisher said we
[4284.30 - 4290.06] can't sell a 12 pound book we can't sell
[4287.84 - 4292.04] a 10 pound whatever book No One's Gonna
[4290.06 - 4295.40] Be able to do anything so they had to
[4292.04 - 4297.20] split it they're two books equally as
[4295.40 - 4298.88] important tell everybody because
[4297.20 - 4300.32] someone's gonna be like I got the brain
[4298.88 - 4303.26] saver book and it's like no you didn't
