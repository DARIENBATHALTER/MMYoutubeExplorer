where are my Stones right here took a

37
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:38,640
walk today with my stones

38
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:41,100
right are you putting them on the

39
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,079
windowsill are you letting your Stones

40
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,640
get some light on them through the

41
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:46,740
window are you looking through the

42
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,799
window while you have your Stones when

43
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:52,740
we look through the window

44
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:55,020
regardless of what scenery is on the

45
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:56,759
outside of that window if we look

46
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,740
through the window

47
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:00,060
something happens here with our neurons

48
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:01,920
something happens with the emotional

49
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:05,280
centers of our brain

50
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:08,280
all kinds of Memories We don't even pick

51
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,660
up on that are circulating through old

52
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,640
memories that are in there that we're

53
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:14,520
not grabbing onto

54
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:16,680
all kinds of connections occur there's

55
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:21,000
something when

56
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:23,160
a human being looks through a window

57
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,140
something happens

58
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,239
something we can't measure something

59
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:30,239
people cannot understand out there

60
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:32,160
science doesn't understand and when we

61
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:35,400
look through a window and we see things

62
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:38,220
we see birds we see trees we see grass

63
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:40,319
we see buildings we see sidewalks

64
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:42,239
whatever it is we see cars when we look

65
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,620
through a window something happens a

66
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,599
connection is made and then the

67
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:49,260
emotional centers of the brain

68
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:52,560
starts to tick and starts to tick and

69
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:55,140
information starts to pour out of your

70
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,300
being and into the stones if it

71
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:59,160
shouldn't be there

72
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,780
a lot of people have experiences where

73
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,340
they look out windows because they were

74
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,780
depressed they had something happen in

75
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:06,239
their life maybe they had some kind of

76
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:07,680
disturbance maybe they had some kind of

77
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,080
abuse maybe they went through a hard

78
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:13,080
time maybe they had losses and it takes

79
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,300
us to the window and we look out the

80
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:18,420
window it takes us to the window in our

81
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:21,239
life how many times have we looked out

82
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:22,620
the window when the relationship breaks

83
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:24,840
at breakups with all kinds of

84
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:26,400
confrontations in life being bullied

85
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,659
whatever it is that's happened in our

86
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,300
life

87
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:32,819
we get kind of taken to the window

88
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:34,800
and we look out

89
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:36,180
and there's a reason for this lots of

90
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,500
reasons for that so the emotional

91
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,819
centers of the brain has all this

92
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,400
information

93
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:43,860
regarding when we actually look out

94
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:46,019
windows

95
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:48,000
it's important is important to know so

96
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:49,640
when you put the stones there by the

97
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,900
windowsill and you look out the window

98
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:53,700
the emotion centers of the brain are

99
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,959
connecting to our soul and so forth and

100
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:57,540
all that I'll talk about that more and

101
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:00,000

00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,860
meals with the stones I'm eating with my

192
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,860
stones

193
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:59,780
we got the cinnamon in here let's mix

194
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,780
that up

195
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,739
[Music]

196
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:10,699
we need a half cup of raisins

197
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:20,180
I'm gonna throw these in here just like

198
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:20,180
this

199
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:25,580
so there's no

200
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:33,500
there's no uh

201
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:33,500
swine in here

202
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:38,779
there's no pig fat in here

203
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:45,120
friend of mine makes

204
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:48,360
some baked goods and

205
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:51,240
puts anything in there

206
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:52,740
imagine he's still a friend of mine

207
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,880
I think the medical medium would say

208
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:57,200
you're not a friend of mine anymore

209
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,200
because of what you eat

210
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:02,240
but that's not how it rolls

211
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:09,899
that doesn't depict

212
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:13,339
if you're

213
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:13,339
a good Soul or not

214
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:20,700
so I'm just mixing this up we're pretty

215
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:22,940
much almost there I'm gonna make these

216
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,940
cookies

217
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:27,060
there we go

218
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:29,160
let's make sure these are moist enough

219
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:31,019
and I think it's the recipe was just

220
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:33,260
perfect right there

221
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:35,760
sometimes your bananas they might not be

222
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:37,860
as soft

223
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:40,019
or as ripe

224
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:43,459
these happen to be that perfect ripeness

225
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:43,459
when you're doing some baking

226
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:50,360
I just want to make sure these oats get

227
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:50,360
the attention they deserve

228
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,080
you guys how are you holding up how are

229
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:59,820
you doing through this transformation

230
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,160
day five of the collecting Stones

231
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:04,880
meditation Journey

232
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,880
there we go

233
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:13,459
I'm gonna make some cookies

234
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:13,459
I think so

235
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:23,480
you don't have to make them too big you

236
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:23,480
don't have to make them too small

237
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,800
you can make them any way you want

238
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:36,800
how about that

239
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,279
there isn't any big rules here

240
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,660
whatever feels good on this you can make

241
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:47,519
one I don't know I wouldn't do I

242
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:49,980
probably wouldn't make one big massive

243
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,660
cookie there we go just want to shake

244
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:54,380
the cookie up a little bit get another

245
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:54,380
pan here

246
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:57,980
there we go

247
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,680
nice

248
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:07,339
small cookies are fun

249
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,339
I like them a little bigger

250
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:24,180
here we go

251
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:25,860
whoa Tara says over there on YouTube I

252
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:27,779
feel better since I started this

253
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:30,000
meditation

254
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:32,940
this is like a meditation all on its own

255
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,320
right here just making these feels

256
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:37,440
really good

257
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:40,440
feels really nice

258
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:43,440
had a good day today

259
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:46,620
it's like you know what I'm gonna

260
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:49,260
bake some cookies tonight I mean I

261
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:52,860
actually do

262
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:55,640
like sometimes something just like this

263
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:55,640
at night

264
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:59,899
for dinner what about you guys

265
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:06,600
you know what I like about these cookies

266
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:10,620
here

267
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:11,760
I didn't have to put any eggs in here

268
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:14,339
because you know medical medium

269
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:18,200
information is the first that ever put

270
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:18,200
out that eggs feed pathogens

271
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:27,180
it was not known in the Health world or

272
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:29,519
medical world the pathogens ate anything

273
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:31,260
at all

274
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,940
but then you see people now saying it

275
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:34,500
even though science hasn't even proved

276
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:37,100
it yet or anything but you see people

277
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,100
saying it

278
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:44,300
where they get that info from oh

279
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:44,300
medical medium information

280
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:48,680
all right you guys we're day five

281
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:57,000
anyway I like doing baked goods without

282
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:58,380
eggs in them I'm not saying look I'm not

283
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,940
saying if you like eggs and that's what

284
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:01,500
you do it's fine but if you got chronic

285
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:03,920
illness if you're struggling in with

286
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:08,339
anything if you're dealing with anything

287
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:10,860
health-wise it's good to keep them out

288
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:14,000
and this is a great recipe

289
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:14,000
a great recipe

290
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:25,040
indeed indeed

291
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:25,040
all right so

292
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:30,019
I'm making these the size that I want

293
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:34,579
to make it smaller to make them bigger

294
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,779
there we go

295
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:53,300
so good so good with raisins

296
00:13:53,579 --> 00:13:57,500
any of you guys raising fans

297
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:04,980
now day five

298
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:07,560
we have day six and we have day seven

299
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:09,300
I hear some of you guys don't want to

300
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,860
let your Stones go

301
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:14,720
already

302
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:14,720
or you're worried about letting them go

303
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,959
it's part of the process it's part of

304
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:21,260
the healing process it's part of the

305
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,260
exercise

306
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,620
letting them go

307
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:30,620
sending them back into nature

308
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:35,959
so nature can diffuse

309
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:39,200
the bomb

310
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,540
yeah

311
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:49,019
of emotions

312
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:53,839
of hurt of Old Wounds store deep inside

313
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:53,839
so nature can diffuse

314
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:00,199
IG

315
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:07,760
roanzin says Anthony I'm finally healed

316
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,760
from eczema and acne

317
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:16,279
that's what it's all about

318
00:15:12,019 --> 00:15:16,279
that's what it's all about

319
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:24,300
that's why we do this

320
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:25,620
Deb says took my stones on my girl's

321
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:27,839
weekend

322
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:31,440
fantastic

323
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:32,820
the best news I ever heard as well

324
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,339
because you don't want to leave your

325
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:37,260
Stones behind you want to take them with

326
00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:38,940
you you don't want to leave them behind

327
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:42,380
where they're just

328
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:42,380
all Left Behind

329
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:46,500

330
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:47,760
gonna be like well my stones are back

331

332
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:51,959
at

333
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:54,420
my house or back there at my apartment

334
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:55,579
back there at home

335
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:58,260
all right

336
00:15:55,579 --> 00:16:00,480
I think this is really really worked out

337
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:02,160
we got a kind of a little bit of a

338
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,899
bigger cookie in the end I can go with

339
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,940
two smaller cookies I can go with a

340
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:08,600
little bit of a bigger cookie right here

341
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:08,600
we go

342
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:13,040
maybe it's the same size

343
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,820
are you guys singing to your Stones

344
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:20,760
that's what I wanted to ask

345
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:25,160
I got a few leftover raisins do you guys

346
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:25,160
mind if I place some of these raisins

347
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:29,459
on top of here I don't want to lose

348
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:32,120
these

349
00:16:29,459 --> 00:16:32,120
there we go

350
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,279
boom

351
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,279
nice

352
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,579
nice

353
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:44,639
you guys I'm gonna pop this in the oven

354
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:47,399
are you okay with that if I leave you

355
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:49,860
for a second my oven's over here can I

356
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:50,940
give you a little bit of a view over

357
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:52,440
there

358
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:54,180
so that's them

359
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:56,579
incredible if you guys just got here

360
00:16:54,180 --> 00:17:00,180
gluten-free banana oat breakfast cookies

361
00:16:56,579 --> 00:17:02,699
you can add dried wild blueberries or

362
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:05,699
chopped dates or cranberries those are

363
00:17:02,699 --> 00:17:07,860
options cranberries make sure though the

364
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:09,959
cranberries have no added oils because

365
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:12,059
it might not be a good oil at all and

366
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:14,339
you don't need to have that

367
00:17:12,059 --> 00:17:16,319
might be a canola oil or something which

368
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:18,740
we don't want to use so these are going

369
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,740
in the oven

370
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:29,160
for 350.

371
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:32,040

372
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:34,679
oven set for three

373
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:36,440

377
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:45,860
and then we're going to do a little

378
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:45,860

sunlit says just put mine on the

381
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,380
windowsill it's Sunset perfect time to

382
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,480
do so

383
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:12,740
putting your stones on the windowsill

384
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,740
great time

385
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:20,520
people looked out the window and they

386
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:24,299
were at work

387
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:26,820
maybe at an office or some workplace

388
00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:29,100
and they just stared out the window

389
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:30,600

how many times have we looked out the

396
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:44,760
window

397
00:18:42,179 --> 00:18:45,780
when we were just contemplating think

398
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,520
about that right there just

399
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:49,020
contemplating

400
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,419
have you ever looked out the window and

401
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:53,940
you're just contemplating

402
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:55,500
and you're looking out the window

403
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:56,760
how many times have you looked out the

404
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:59,160
window because you're having a bad day

405
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:00,480
you were having you were having a

406
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,799
stressful moment in your life a

407
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,320
stressful day

408
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:07,020
and something just took you over to the

409
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:09,000
window to look out the window how many

410
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:10,380
of you had that where you're looking out

411
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,580
the window because you're having a hard

412
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:13,260
day

413
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:15,000
how many people look out the window

414
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:16,799
because they want to see what's going on

415
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,620
outside no matter what and it's a part

416
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:21,780
of their routine so it's part of their

417
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:24,900
routine to look out the window look at

418
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:28,580
hummingbirds look at birds look at just

419
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:28,580
anything going on out there

420
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:33,360
look at the trees

421
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:35,640
how many people look out the window when

422
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,679
it rains you have a rainy day and

423
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:39,000
something kind of comes over you and you

424
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:42,600
feel

425
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:45,419
a little sad you just

426
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:47,220
you want to go to the window

427
00:19:45,419 --> 00:19:49,460
Courtney says I feel trapped inside of

428
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,460
work

429
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:59,360
since he's just looking out

430
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:59,360
Tristan Marie says it's my daily routine

431
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,919
what happens when

432
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:13,580
pathways are accessed

433
00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:13,580
that we don't normally have access to

434
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:16,380
so

435
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:18,360
basically a channel opens up

436
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:20,160
automatically emotional centers of the

437
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:24,120
brain connect to other areas of the

438
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:28,620
brain meaning the non-emotional areas

439
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:30,780
information is trans transferred

440
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:32,460
sometimes we get Nostalgia when we're

441
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:33,720
looking out windows sometimes we get big

442
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:37,140
ideas

443
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:39,059
great ideas sometimes we get

444
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:41,520
memories

445
00:20:39,059 --> 00:20:43,200
but either way Windows play a big part

446
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,539
that's part of the whole windowsill

447
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:48,500
stones on the windowsill with you while

448
00:20:45,539 --> 00:20:48,500
you're looking out the window

449
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:51,980
on day five

450
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:56,100

451
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:57,840

going to page 450 I want to read just a

463
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,679
little bit just for fun

464
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,539
anywhere you open up the medical medium

465
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:29,580
books it's just people own away when

466
00:21:27,539 --> 00:21:30,659
have you opened them up in a while have

467
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:33,539
you read

468
00:21:30,659 --> 00:21:36,000
it's like you've never read it before

469
00:21:33,539 --> 00:21:38,600
that's what's interesting too cookies

470
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,600
are baking

471
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:44,640
I feel like some big baking tonight

472
00:21:42,419 --> 00:21:47,520
Jim says hi aw thanks for all you do for

473
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:52,220
us could you explain why I'm sensitive

474
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:52,220
to a heated oven I really miss baking

475
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:58,320
um beer on detective first of all are

476
00:21:54,360 --> 00:22:00,000
you sensitive to Pete in general are you

477
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,740
sensitive to a really hot day because I

478
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,840
know some people they can't handle a 90

479
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:06,659
degree day they can't handle 85 degree

480
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:10,620
and humid they can't handle 78 degrees

481
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:14,039
anything above 75 degrees

482
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:16,980
oven heat is dry dry heat sensitive

483
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:18,240
nervous systems don't like super dry

484
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:20,880
heat

485
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:24,240
so sensitive nervous systems do not like

486
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:27,360
super dry heat sensitive sinus cavities

487
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:31,020
do not like super dry heat of course

488
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:32,460
real humid humid heat is a whole nother

489
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:34,440
you know

490
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:35,640
irritation for a lot of people on its

491
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:38,400
own but I'm talking about dry heat

492
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:41,100
coming out of the oven

493
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:43,799
when people are struggling they're

494
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:46,740
overheated internally overheated too

495
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:48,600
they might have a struggling stagnant

496
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:50,580
sluggish liver

497
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:54,559
and then info

498
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:54,559
now taken for granted around the world

499
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:59,120
about stagnant and sluggish livers about

500
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,120
why

501
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,620
if I don't mention that people be like

502
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,360
oh he must have got it from this person

503
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:07,620
he was got it from that person he must

504
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:10,559
have got it from this person no

505
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:12,780
originated from the medical me books

506
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:14,880
okay I want to read a little if you guys

507
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:17,159
are open to it

508
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:19,260
Charlotte career says I've been dealing

509
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:21,299
with awful heat sensitivity but it's

510
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:23,460
slowly getting better with mm info and

511
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:25,620
the reason why people have awful heat

512
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:27,600
sensitivity for the most part not

513
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:30,480
everybody most people have heat

514
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:32,220
sensitivity because of a sensitive

515
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,320
central nervous system sensitive central

516
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:37,760
nervous system and sensitive cranial

517
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,760
nerves that's a big one right there

518
00:23:39,179 --> 00:23:45,120
sensitive cranial nerves

519
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,740
big one right there all the cranial

520
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,480
nerves

521
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:50,640
when people have those sensitive cranial

522
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,980
nerves what happens is insensitive vagus

523
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,900
nerve

524
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:55,980
sensitive vagus nerves the cranial

525
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:58,020
nerves

526
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:59,940
people have issues with that then they

527
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:01,679
get heat sensitive they're sensitive to

528
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:04,320
the heat outside they're sensitive to a

529
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:07,260
lot of sun sensitive to heat sensitive

530
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:10,919
to ovens they're sensitive to stoves

531
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:13,700
they're just sensitive to a lot of heat

532
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:13,700
that's a noise

533
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:18,900
Compton says where can I get the

534
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:20,640

547
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:57,360
struggle for me finally been making

Sharon K over there on YouTube says my

560
00:25:21,059 --> 00:25:26,880
stone found me it came out of nowhere

561
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:28,559
very interesting

562
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,820
profound actually

563
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:32,279
found

564
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:34,679
what experience that is

565
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:37,559
the idea of cutting out foods from your

566
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:39,179
diet even for the short space of a mini

567
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:41,700
cleanse just say

568
00:25:39,179 --> 00:25:43,860
can be loaded

569
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:47,159
for women especially

570
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:51,179
societal messaging has attached shame to

571
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:53,340
food choices for far too long

572
00:25:51,179 --> 00:25:55,940
I've always said that I'm not the food

573
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:55,940
police

574
00:25:56,220 --> 00:26:01,020
medical meme information was the first

575
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:04,380
to bring back fruit

576
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:05,820
into the world of Health as we speak

577
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:08,460
even though there's still a battle

578
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:11,460
trying to stop fruit from being in any

579
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:14,340
of the health genres

580
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:16,440
fruit fear was the big one

581
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:18,419
so I spent 30 years trying to break

582
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:20,520
fruit fear because fruit was not allowed

583
00:26:18,419 --> 00:26:21,960
in anybody's diet

584
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:24,000
that had anything to do with natural

585
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:25,559
health on any level

586
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,760
and he kind of cleanses any kind of

587
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:29,520
Natural Health

588
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:31,440
in any way fruit was not allowed and no

589
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:33,179
disrespect to all

590
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,400
frames of

591
00:26:33,179 --> 00:26:38,340
of the health world everything from

592
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:41,039
naturopaths to acupuncturists and so far

593
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:42,720
so so forth like acupuncturist said

594
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:44,760
fruit gave you dampness you you're not

595
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,200
allowed to have it it can't have raw

596
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:48,299
fruit like everybody had their thing

597
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:50,039
naturopath said too much sugar feeds you

598
00:26:48,299 --> 00:26:51,779
know Candida

599
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:54,600
see

600
00:26:51,779 --> 00:26:57,240
to Sweet Jane over there

601
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:59,100
um I don't mess with any sugar except

602
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:02,220
wild blueberries

603
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:06,779
fruit today is all GMO despite being

604
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:08,580
organic too much sugar well fruit isn't

605
00:27:06,779 --> 00:27:10,440
GMO

606
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:11,700
today I mean but but I'm glad you're

607
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:14,159
doing the wild blueberries and no

608
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:15,419
disrespect thank you for actually that

609
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:16,860
comment because that comment's very

610
00:27:15,419 --> 00:27:18,539
interesting

611
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:21,120
so

612
00:27:18,539 --> 00:27:23,580
if you're getting like the Honeycrisp

613
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:26,340
apple per se that's not GMO

614
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:29,900
if you're getting some pairs

615
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:33,480
some Bartlett pears that's not GMO so

616
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:36,840
bananas are grafted to start with the

617
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:38,340
corn that's not GM not corn corn

618
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,779
this whole thing the banana trees right

619
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:42,480
the corns

620
00:27:39,779 --> 00:27:44,520
that's not GMO

621
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:47,840
so it's important to know

622
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:47,840
but but but but

623
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:54,419
in Hawaii

624
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:55,740
I would never eat a papaya there I mean

625
00:27:54,419 --> 00:27:59,159
of course you can eat a papaya there

626
00:27:55,740 --> 00:28:02,460
chances are they're GMO

627
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:05,640
or serious GMO contamination

628
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:08,400
because Hawaii is GMO capital

629
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:11,539
literally GMO Capital it's where they

630
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,539
grow all the medical corn

631
00:28:12,299 --> 00:28:16,260
is a beautiful place

632
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:18,240
but

633
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:20,640
beauty also

634
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,679
another flip side of that there's some

635
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,360
hidden dark secrets

636
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:28,340
and so Hawaii

637
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:31,940
is literally the GMO

638
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:31,940
Ground Zero

639
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:37,679
including every Island

640
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:40,020
okay

641
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:42,480
but it's still a beautiful place let's

642
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:44,340
go a little bit here

643
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,440
so the idea of cutting out foods for

644
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:49,620
your diet even for the short space of a

645
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:51,840
mini cleanse is fully loaded a loaded

646
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:54,179
topic for women especially societal

647
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:57,360
messaging has attached shame to food

648
00:28:54,179 --> 00:28:59,159
choices for far too long

649
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,600
I've always said that I'm not the food

650
00:28:59,159 --> 00:29:03,059
police

651
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:04,620
and that will always be true

652
00:29:03,059 --> 00:29:07,020
remember this when you see a medical

653
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:09,360
medium recommendation to limit or

654
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:12,059
temporarily cut out a certain food

655
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:14,580
that is never attached to judgment on

656
00:29:12,059 --> 00:29:16,860
any level so there's no judgment

657
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:19,200
that's why I have friends

658
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:22,320
that just eat what they want

659
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:25,799
I did not defriend them

660
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:28,380
I did not say you are not my friend I am

661
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:31,020
the medical medium

662
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:33,840
and how dare you be a friend of mine if

663
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:38,059
you're eating an egg how dare you be a

664
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:38,059
friend of mine if you're eating whatever

665
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:45,380
far from the food police

666
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:45,380
so much so far from the food police

667
00:29:48,059 --> 00:29:52,260
far

668
00:29:49,799 --> 00:29:53,399
it's unbelievable talk about that

669
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:55,980
another time

670
00:29:53,399 --> 00:29:59,100
Lilly says in IG my daughter back in

671
00:29:55,980 --> 00:30:01,260
2015 was listening to you and you healed

672
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:02,940
and cleared out her skin explanation

673
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:04,740
points thank you so much aw you're

674
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:07,640
welcome

675
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:07,640
that's your service

676
00:30:12,659 --> 00:30:15,360
I never judge anybody for what they're

677
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:18,059
eating

678
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:19,799
never will never have

679
00:30:18,059 --> 00:30:21,240
I'll never judge them if they're eating

680
00:30:19,799 --> 00:30:23,520
something in a store that was in a

681
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:25,860
package some kind of crazy cupcake with

682
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:28,080
some kind of like weird hard white icing

683
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:29,340
strip down the center of it I never

684
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:32,460
judge them if they're eating some kind

685
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:34,200
of crazy fudge cookie in a package

686
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:36,000
I never judge them if they're making

687
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:38,100
some pancakes and they throw all kinds

688
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,320
of crap in there and they got bacon on

689
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:42,899
the side or anything else like that I

690
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:44,399
never forever JoJo you know and that's

691
00:30:42,899 --> 00:30:47,220
the thing and it's so important to know

692
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:49,440
because what happens is that

693
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:50,700
it wouldn't be

694
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,380
Fair

695
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:53,880
to anyone

696
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:56,039
it just wouldn't

697
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:58,500
it wouldn't it's a hard World we're

698
00:30:56,039 --> 00:31:00,059
raised on certain foods a lot of us

699
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:02,100
don't know we don't have the education

700
00:31:00,059 --> 00:31:04,080
and when we do it's still hard

701
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:07,200
Trisha Marie says my conventional doctor

702
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:10,140
had me afraid to drink juice or fruit

703
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:14,120
smoothies it was disappointing hearing

704
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:14,120
that he thought it was bad for the liver

705
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:20,880
medical medium information

706
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:23,700
was about breaking the fruit fear

707
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:26,039
putting the wild blueberries out there

708
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:27,419
the messaging the information being a

709
00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:29,820
messenger about the power of the wild

710
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:33,480
blueberries it was about getting fruit

711
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:36,480
back into the diet done right

712
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:38,940
so people can heal it's not about being

713
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:40,799
fruitarian that's not it at all mm info

714
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:43,140
isn't about fruit only and only fruit

715
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:44,520
and nothing but fruit a mistake I've

716
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:46,440
seen out there where people talk about

717
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:48,179
quite the contrary

718
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:51,419
and then info brought in the leafy

719
00:31:48,179 --> 00:31:55,020
greens not just the fruit people did not

720
00:31:51,419 --> 00:31:58,520
eat real leafy greens nor did they treat

721
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:58,520
herbs like leafy greens

722
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:05,880
and medical medium

723
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:09,419
me

724
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:12,539
never ever shame someone for eating meat

725
00:32:09,419 --> 00:32:14,100
quite the contrary I always said you can

726
00:32:12,539 --> 00:32:16,380
heal while eating meat if you want to be

727
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:19,440
a meat eater

728
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:21,539
and you can still heal if you

729
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,799
want to learn the tools and the

730
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:24,779
information

731
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:27,000
the mm info shows you how to do it while

732
00:32:24,779 --> 00:32:28,799
eating meat and you can still heal the

733
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,600
mm info shows you how to do it if you're

734
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:32,760
plant-based and never shamed anybody for

735
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:36,840
being plant-based ever

736
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:39,179
will never did

737
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:41,220
nor anybody who was a pescetarian or

738
00:32:39,179 --> 00:32:42,899
anybody that was a vegetarian or anybody

739
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:46,340
who did anything

740
00:32:42,899 --> 00:32:46,340
because it's not about that

741
00:32:48,179 --> 00:32:54,299
a medical medium cleanse is never about

742
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:57,539
virtuousness virtuousness

743
00:32:54,299 --> 00:33:01,460
versus shame it's about healings it's

744
00:32:57,539 --> 00:33:01,460
never about being so virtuous

745
00:33:01,799 --> 00:33:05,820
right

746
00:33:03,539 --> 00:33:08,520
it's about healing

747
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:12,440
and from a medical perspective

748
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:12,440
shame is not healing

749
00:33:12,539 --> 00:33:18,600
shame releases a harsh adrenaline blend

750
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:20,940
that's corrosive and abrasive to our

751
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:24,120
neurons our nervous system and can

752
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:26,519
weaken our immune system that's what

753
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:27,600
that adrenaline from shame is that's why

754
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:30,480
we're doing the collective Stones

755
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:32,399
meditation too some of our stones are

756
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,559
named shame I've noticed that people

757
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:36,960
name their Stone shame it's incredible

758
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:38,460
because what happens is all that stored

759
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,919
up the wounds and the soul and

760
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:43,440
everything based around shame starts to

761
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:45,360
funnel out into that stone and that

762
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:48,000
Stone's mineral composition is taking it

763
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:50,419
in and absorbing it it's eating up that

764
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,419
shame

765
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:55,860
Baghdad says as a nurse I remember the

766
00:33:53,940 --> 00:34:00,000
first time reading your first book years

767
00:33:55,860 --> 00:34:03,480
ago and going quote Oh my God this makes

768
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:06,919
so much sense so much more sense than

769
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:06,919
what I have been taught

770
00:34:09,899 --> 00:34:14,879
over there on IG

771
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:17,700
my mm healing lifestyle and IG says my

772
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:21,679
Mom's doctor told her to have

773
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:21,679
half a banana only for breakfast

774
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:31,200
I'm Doctor

775
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:33,240
I'm not just so and so

776
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:35,399
I think the phone just I thought I heard

777
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:38,780
the phone ringing

778
00:34:35,399 --> 00:34:38,780
I thought I heard the phone ring

779
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:43,200
if you set out with the very best

780
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,760
intentions

781
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:46,800
if you set out with the very best

782
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:48,780
intentions for your health and then have

783
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:51,599
a terrible stressful day where

784
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:53,520
appointment after a appointment ends up

785
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:55,560
on your calendar and you get over hungry

786
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:57,900
and reach for a food that's outside the

787
00:34:55,560 --> 00:35:00,480
cleanse because it's sitting right there

788
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:03,500
in the break room does that mean that

789
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,500
you should feel guilty

790
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:15,240
hi I'm Dr food shame

791
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:18,660
I got the food shame as I recommended

792
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:20,220
only eat a little tiny piece of banana

793
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:22,859
for breakfast

794
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:26,460
I only recommend

795
00:35:22,859 --> 00:35:27,960
huh I'm not the food please

796
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:30,240
no no

797
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:33,720
why you hear that in social media about

798
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:36,960
the medical medium he's so bad he's

799
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:38,640
restricting everybody but I won't let my

800
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,780
patients have more than a little piece

801
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:43,920
of banana

802
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:45,900
for breakfast yes Dr food shavier a

803
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,740
nurse nurse did you just put off the

804
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:50,280
line

yes is this and no more than a little

806
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:54,500
piece of banana

807
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:54,500
that's all

808
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:03,000
Dr Fine many of the high protein gurus

809
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:06,240
can't even eat a banana without their

810
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:10,040
sugar spiking to 200 to 300 they created

811
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:10,040
their own insulin resistance

812
00:36:11,339 --> 00:36:16,560
they did

813
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:18,359
correct

814
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,400
okay okay okay

815
00:36:18,359 --> 00:36:23,640
wait wait

816
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:26,160
I'm gonna check my cookies

817
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:28,500
I have an oven mitt here

818
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:32,420
fantastic I'm just making sure they're

819
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:32,420
brown they got that nice toasty look

820
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:41,280
coming together nice

821
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:42,660
they need a couple more minutes

822
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,900
it's good it's good a couple more

823
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:44,900
minutes

824
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:49,040
I'm gonna keep this up

825
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,320
you guys are we having fun

826
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:58,520
is I'm having a blast

827
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:03,500
I'm trying not to crack myself up though

828
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:10,880
Chris Angela says just the laugh I

829
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:10,880
needed while on a break at work

830
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:21,240
whatever food choice you make at

831
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:24,480
whatever time it's not bad or shameful

832
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:28,640
it's only that a choice you made and the

833
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:28,640
next time you can make another choice

834
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:34,680
because food choices outside the

835
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:38,460
guidelines of any cleanse

836
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:41,300
does it mean you're a bad person doing

837
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:41,300
the best you can

838
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:47,160
when you eat a food that you know

839
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:48,859
doesn't take you closer to feeling

840
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:51,420
relief from your symptoms

841
00:37:48,859 --> 00:37:54,599
self-punishment shouldn't come into the

842
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:57,359
picture we should not self-punish

843
00:37:54,599 --> 00:38:01,500
ourselves we shouldn't

844
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:03,119
we shouldn't self-punish ourselves

845
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:05,700
it shouldn't come into the picture

846
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:08,220
should not

847
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:10,680
rather than enter that headspace try to

848
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:12,960
remind yourself gently that physically

849
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:15,980
the best choice you can make is to be

850
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:19,260
kind to yourself being kind to yourself

851
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:21,000
really important

852
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:24,240
healing

853
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:26,520
is not an easy process

854
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:28,440
we have to be good to ourselves while

855
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:29,880
while we're healing while we're going

856
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:31,980
through the process

857
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:34,020
while blueberry dreams on IG says yet I

858
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:36,900
healed my brain lesion using medical

859
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:38,579
medium info incredible

860
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:41,579
incredible

861
00:38:38,579 --> 00:38:43,920
AKA Amy Kelly on IG celery juice

862
00:38:41,579 --> 00:38:48,680
literally is still saving me thank you

863
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:48,680
mm credible info in all the books

864
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:53,339
I drink celery juice every day

865
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:56,820
I try to drink it every day

866
00:38:53,339 --> 00:38:58,500
once in a blue moon I'll miss it or I

867
00:38:56,820 --> 00:39:00,420
don't drink it in the morning I drink it

868
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:02,520
at the end of the day it just happens it

869
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:06,560
happens I'm not gonna punish myself I'm

870
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:06,560
not not gonna flog myself

871
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:09,680
I'm not gonna like

872
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:15,960
not gonna take a whip and or a strap and

873
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:17,820
whap my back

874
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:20,599
I'm not gonna do it

875
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:20,599
I'm not

876
00:39:24,839 --> 00:39:28,320
be kind to yourself what does that

877
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:30,480
kindness look like it would seem like

878
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:33,300
the ultimate triumph over food shame

879
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:37,640
would be to eat anything you want at any

880
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:37,640
time I wish that were true

881
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:43,920
you can do that it's certainly an option

882
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:45,599
if your resource is allowed that will

883
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:47,520
take you down a route where you end up

884
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:49,940
sicker though

885
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:52,400
just a reality

886
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:55,619
self-compassion looks more like a pause

887
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:58,619
whenever you get the impulse to reach

888
00:39:55,619 --> 00:40:00,420
for a food that isn't part of a cleanse

889
00:39:58,619 --> 00:40:03,380
or part of what you're doing your

890
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:03,380
routine to heal

891
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:07,380

are we really talking about cookies

894
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:17,460
are we really talking about cookies

895
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:20,700

I'm hungry hungry Linda Thomas says I'm

901
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:32,040
not a fan of bananas but I certainly

902
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:35,060
would make these cookies with banana and

903
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:37,980
enjoy them indeed

904
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:40,280
I am very excited about these cookies I

905
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:40,280
must say

906
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:46,980

right now

920
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:18,540
don't be a hero can I read this for a

921
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:21,260
couple seconds

922
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:21,260
couple of minutes

923
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:25,500
rewatch this live once it's posted for

924
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:27,480
the recipe because that showed the

925
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:29,280
recipe already

926
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:31,619
another way to show compassion for

927
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:33,900
yourself is to think ahead taking into

928
00:41:31,619 --> 00:41:36,839
account the fundamental truth that you

929
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:40,940
get to have an appetite

930
00:41:36,839 --> 00:41:40,940
hunger is a sign of life

931
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:47,599
I love when Tick Tock shuts down my life

932
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:47,599
and kicks me off

933
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:52,380
you have nothing to prove by going all

934
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:54,060
morning without breakfast or skipping

935
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:57,619
lunch now here's something interesting

936
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:57,619
and something important to know right

937
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:04,560
mm info isn't about

938
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:06,359
intermittent fasting and not eating

939
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:08,640
anything all day long

940
00:42:06,359 --> 00:42:10,680
until the very end of the night

941
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:12,960
it's not about that

942
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:16,859
that's the way you kill your adrenals

943
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:21,000
you destroy your adrenals

944
00:42:16,859 --> 00:42:23,880
mm info the cleanses any or

945
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:26,339
the information in here is adrenal

946
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:28,440
protective it's all about protecting the

947
00:42:26,339 --> 00:42:30,780
adrenals so these cleanses and these

948
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:32,880
books are Geared for protecting The

949
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:34,260
Originals you'll see misinformation out

950
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:36,720
there and you'll see somebody say oh

951
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:38,280
wait it's too tough on adrenals what are

952
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:40,400
you talking about it's actually for your

953
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:43,260
adrenals it's to protect them because

954
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:45,000
adrenals are destroyed with all these

955
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:47,579
other different diets and different

956
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,260
things and belief systems out there they

957
00:42:47,579 --> 00:42:51,240
just get annihilated with so many people

958
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:53,940
they do good for a little while and then

959
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:56,420
boom they're hurting bad later they

960
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:56,420
don't know why

961
00:43:02,339 --> 00:43:08,339
all it does is set you up to run on

962
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:10,920
adrenaline and get tired irritable

963
00:43:08,339 --> 00:43:13,640
I'm gonna get these cookies out

964
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:13,640
take a look

965
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:25,319
I like my cookies with a little bit of

966
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:27,420
crispiness to it

967
00:43:25,319 --> 00:43:29,700
I don't like them chewy and soft I like

968
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:32,060
them a little bit crisp crispy a little

969
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:32,060
brown

970
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,839
what happens is a lot of people don't

971
00:43:34,619 --> 00:43:39,480
realize it but they run on adrenaline

972
00:43:36,839 --> 00:43:42,420
and get tired and irritable and they get

973
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:44,579
over hungry and then they do

974
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:46,740
grab things they probably wouldn't have

975
00:43:44,579 --> 00:43:49,520
grabbed because they starved themselves

976
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:49,520
the whole day

977
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:59,940
tree spennett says I'm in day three of

978
00:43:55,380 --> 00:44:02,280
369 wish me luck haha amazing

979
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:05,520
so happy to hear that

980
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:06,960
healing with Holly 144 hunger is a sign

981
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:08,160
of life

982
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:10,500
quote

983
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:13,760
I think about this mm quote so often

984
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:13,760
it's so comforting

985
00:44:17,819 --> 00:44:22,200
whenever you can plan ahead prep your

986
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:23,940
snacks and meals ahead of time on days

987
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:26,099
you'll be away from home or when you

988
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:28,140
know you'll get too busy to stop and

989
00:44:26,099 --> 00:44:30,240
spend time in the kitchen midday think

990
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:33,000
about ordering cases of produce if you

991
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:35,940
need to so you have it like a you know a

992
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,140
backlog of it it's that it's it's what

993
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:38,880
you need

994
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:40,020
to have enough ingredients on hand

995
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,640
another thing too is a lot of people

996
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:43,500
don't have the ingredients they don't

997
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:46,200
have bananas on hand

998
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:48,599
they didn't grab a few extra bunches

999
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:50,819
they don't have potatoes on hand they

1000
00:44:48,599 --> 00:44:52,920
didn't grab an extra bag a five pound

1001
00:44:50,819 --> 00:44:54,900
bag of potatoes so they really don't

1002
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:56,460
have much in stock

1003
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:57,780
and they're grabbing little pieces here

1004
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:59,400
and there and then end up going and

1005
00:44:57,780 --> 00:45:01,740
ordering something or they end up going

1006
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:03,300
out and getting food out and in that

1007
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:05,940
food out it's like

1008
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:08,880
the fake olive oil mixed with canola oil

1009
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:11,760
and all the MSG and in the food out and

1010
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:13,680
everything even foods that are in like

1011
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:16,260
seemingly healthy restaurants really

1012
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:18,060
healthy restaurants loaded with MSG the

1013
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:22,280
soy sauces that are all hidden in there

1014
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:22,280
everything just lots of MSG

1015
00:45:26,819 --> 00:45:32,660
cookie time

1016
00:45:29,339 --> 00:45:32,660
put my Stones right here

1017
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:44,060
yeah

1018
00:45:41,339 --> 00:45:44,060
boom

1019
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:49,140
can I actually show you guys

1020
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:52,020
there's a raisin that's running around I

1021
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:55,020
saw a raisin running around

1022
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:57,000
just that was crazy watch this video

1023
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:59,780
afterwards find out how that reason was

1024
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,780
cruising like that

1025
00:46:01,319 --> 00:46:03,859
all right

1026
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:19,640
okay let me get these on a plate

1027
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:23,760
but I'm gonna let them cool a little bit

1028
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:26,960
did you ever burn your tongue because

1029
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:26,960
you don't want to wait

1030
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:31,819
this is a very hot cookie right here

1031
00:46:29,099 --> 00:46:31,819
right out of the oven

1032
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:39,000
but I know I'm gonna burn my tongue or

1033
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:41,579
burn my mouth

1034
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:44,240
Gotta Wait I gotta have patience gotta

1035
00:46:41,579 --> 00:46:44,240
have some patience

1036
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:47,819
boots McGee over there on YouTube

1037
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:50,220
definitely as long as I'm eating every

1038
00:46:47,819 --> 00:46:53,160
90 minutes I make way better decisions

1039
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:55,380
you also protect your adrenals

1040
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:58,980
but since the light blasts I no longer

1041
00:46:55,380 --> 00:47:02,099
beat myself up when it isn't feasible

1042
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:03,980
do not beat yourself up

1043
00:47:02,099 --> 00:47:06,359
and I'm so glad you don't anymore

1044
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:07,800
mystere said pretty cookies over there

1045
00:47:06,359 --> 00:47:09,180
on YouTube

1046
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:10,319
so we're talking about all kinds of

1047
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:12,119
stuff I just want to give you guys a

1048
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:13,920
reminder we are day five with collecting

1049
00:47:12,119 --> 00:47:15,660
Stones medication journey and it's a

1050
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:18,180
profound Journey now

1051
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:20,160
kind of downplay in it

1052
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:22,380
I'm downplaying it because I'm getting a

1053
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:24,960
little emotional about

1054
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:26,880
day seven when we have to let our Stones

1055
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:28,380
go

1056
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:31,260
it's unbelievable what's happening it's

1057
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:33,660
a phenomenon or or a hundred thousand

1058
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:35,579
people doing this collecting Stones

1059
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:39,359
meditation Journey with us all together

1060
00:47:35,579 --> 00:47:41,940
there are a hundred thousand people

1061
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:45,000
doing this collecting Stones meditation

1062
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:47,280
Journey as of right now

1063
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:49,440
a hundred thousand people

1064
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:52,380
so keep that in mind this is like a

1065
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:55,020
collective this is a Powerhouse of

1066
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:56,520
healing happening for all of us people

1067
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:58,800
are feeling so comfortable with their

1068
00:47:56,520 --> 00:48:00,660
Stones they're able to talk to them and

1069
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:04,260
not feel judged

1070
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:06,060
that is incredible and mind-blowing and

1071
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:07,680
very healing they don't feel like

1072
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:09,420
they're being judged when they're

1073
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:13,280
talking to their stones

1074
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:13,280
they don't feel that way at all

1075
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:17,220
there's Martinez says over there on

1076
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:19,319
YouTube the light blast was my first one

1077
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:21,359
I'm so grateful we had the opportunity

1078
00:48:19,319 --> 00:48:23,220
to do it it helped me I'm planning on

1079
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:25,020
another one I don't know when but it's

1080
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:28,880
going to be it's gonna be this year and

1081
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:28,880
it's going to be sometime soon

1082
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:34,859
I think that I'm trying to keep it kind

1083
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:37,640
of low-key

1084
00:48:34,859 --> 00:48:39,960
but I'm beaming absolutely beaming

1085
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:41,819
because I know the kind of healing

1086
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:44,579
that's taking place

1087
00:48:41,819 --> 00:48:47,520
in every individual

1088
00:48:44,579 --> 00:48:48,800
and I'm

1089
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:51,599
it's it's

1090
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:54,480
extremely exciting

1091
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:56,220
but I kind of got a little nervousness

1092
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:59,099
right because the nervousness is

1093
00:48:56,220 --> 00:49:02,040
involved with I know

1094
00:48:59,099 --> 00:49:03,720
the time has to come to release and let

1095
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:07,260
the stones go

1096
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:08,760
I know it's coming soon

1097
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:10,980
that's gonna be hard to let go of my

1098
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:12,720
Stones I've actually really have grown

1099
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:14,339
close to my Stones my stones have been

1100
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:16,319
absorbing so much

1101
00:49:14,339 --> 00:49:19,140
of the things that have been inside me

1102
00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:22,079
that that I've experienced

1103
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:24,420
being an underdog being um being bullied

1104
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:27,599
my whole life all of it for hearing a

1105
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:29,579
voice being taken advantage of being

1106
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:31,800
taken taken for granted

1107
00:49:29,579 --> 00:49:32,520
people poaching all my info not citing

1108
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:34,859
me

1109
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:37,380
not having any respect for the fact that

1110
00:49:34,859 --> 00:49:40,500
there's so much contributed

1111
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:42,900
from me in spirit to the health movement

1112
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:44,940
in these last 35 years and how it would

1113
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:48,900
not be like it is today

1114
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:52,859
it would be literally a Barren desert

1115
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:55,980
and all of that I can live with

1116
00:49:52,859 --> 00:49:58,680
but it's nice to get some of

1117
00:49:55,980 --> 00:50:01,079
this hurt that's been in there and get

1118
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:04,440
that out into the stones and more than

1119
00:50:01,079 --> 00:50:07,880
35 years of the work I've done

1120
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:07,880
to get information out there

1121
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:12,300
healing From the Inside Out says hubby

1122
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:14,579
and I have had these awful tense

1123
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:17,160
conversations about a certain subject

1124
00:50:14,579 --> 00:50:21,300
day three we've literally broke into

1125
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:24,180

I'm IG

1351
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:14,339
Ria says

1352
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:18,059
why do all heart specialists and other

1353
01:02:14,339 --> 01:02:20,579
doctors promoting a low carb diet

1354
01:02:18,059 --> 01:02:24,480
personally I'm sick of hearing about how

1355
01:02:20,579 --> 01:02:27,240
bad carbs are I'm grabbing an apple now

1356
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:29,819
dear Lord

1357
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:32,059
apples are incredible for the heart the

1358
01:02:29,819 --> 01:02:32,059
liver

1359
01:02:32,339 --> 01:02:37,559
apples are so good for the liver

1360
01:02:35,220 --> 01:02:40,220
and when the liver gets healthier it

1361
01:02:37,559 --> 01:02:40,220
helps the heart

1362
01:02:42,299 --> 01:02:46,500
and they say I'm the food police for

1363
01:02:45,180 --> 01:02:48,660
you you're not even allowed to eat an

1364
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:50,099
apple

1365
01:02:48,660 --> 01:02:54,180
Susan says

1366
01:02:50,099 --> 01:02:57,119
I'm sorry upset I had to stop my stones

1367
01:02:54,180 --> 01:02:59,660
medication

1368
01:02:57,119 --> 01:02:59,660
wait a minute

1369
01:03:01,140 --> 01:03:06,660
Susan Fontes on IG

1370
01:03:04,140 --> 01:03:08,579
I'm sorry upset

1371
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:10,319
I had to stop my Stones medication

1372
01:03:08,579 --> 01:03:11,579
because I had an extremely difficult and

1373
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:14,400
stressful day

1374
01:03:11,579 --> 01:03:15,960
oh meditation but it turned out to a

1375
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:17,700
typo to medication I was going to say

1376
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:19,020
did you really have your stones on

1377
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:23,640
medication

1378
01:03:19,020 --> 01:03:23,640
I thought the stones were on medication

1379
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:26,880
I had an extremely difficult and

1380
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:29,040
stressful day I'm really sorry to hear

1381
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:31,799
that then I couldn't find my stones for

1382
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:35,099
two days oh my God

1383
01:03:31,799 --> 01:03:36,780
but I couldn't reach at all

1384
01:03:35,099 --> 01:03:39,440
that's your heart

1385
01:03:36,780 --> 01:03:39,440
all right

1386
01:03:39,780 --> 01:03:43,559
I think hopefully I wasn't rude

1387
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:46,319
um

1388
01:03:43,559 --> 01:03:48,359
listen we we get

1389
01:03:46,319 --> 01:03:50,640
I understand you know when we get

1390
01:03:48,359 --> 01:03:52,680
stressful days

1391
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:53,819
and we can't even do we can't even do

1392
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:55,980
what we need to do but that's okay

1393
01:03:53,819 --> 01:03:57,780
because your intention is there you have

1394
01:03:55,980 --> 01:03:59,460
it in the back your mind

1395
01:03:57,780 --> 01:04:01,440
so if you had a really stressful day and

1396
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:03,599
you didn't you weren't able to do the

1397
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:05,839
stone meditation for two days that's

1398
01:04:03,599 --> 01:04:05,839
okay

1399
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:11,640
your Stones know this they know this so

1400
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:14,220
keep on going if you can all the way to

1401
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:15,900
the end you got still today tonight you

1402
01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:17,819
still got tomorrow you still got the

1403
01:04:15,900 --> 01:04:21,680
