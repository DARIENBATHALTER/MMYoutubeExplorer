[1391.12 - 1394.56] you got tinnitus vertigo we've got
[1392.96 - 1396.16] eczema psoriasis
[1394.56 - 1399.12] maybe got something else and the
[1396.16 - 1401.36] protocols are in here
[1399.12 - 1404.24] i don't know what i can do
[1401.36 - 1406.88] i can work i could work i could talk the
[1404.24 - 1408.88] spirit of compassion i could break all
[1406.88 - 1410.72] the rules in the in the health world in
[1408.88 - 1412.40] the sense where we got more people
[1410.72 - 1414.56] healed than ever before in chronic
[1412.40 - 1415.44] illness history which breaks all the
[1414.56 - 1416.72] rules
[1415.44 - 1418.56] because you're not supposed to get
[1416.72 - 1420.00] millions of people better but yet
[1418.56 - 1421.44] medical medium information did that it
[1420.00 - 1424.00] can do all this
[1421.44 - 1426.64] but i can't i can't do any more than
[1424.00 - 1428.40] that you have to sometimes say you know
[1426.64 - 1430.56] what i think i'm gonna go to the library
[1428.40 - 1432.24] i'm gonna get the book out for free
[1430.56 - 1433.52] and i'm going to work on it i'm going to
[1432.24 - 1435.60] work on it
[1433.52 - 1437.52] or whatever get the book amazon or
[1435.60 - 1440.96] something so there's the lemon bump
[1437.52 - 1441.84] licorice fruit why licorice fruit
[1440.96 - 1443.60] okay
[1441.84 - 1445.68] licorice fruit's a big one for those hot
[1443.60 - 1448.16] flashes what does it say for licorice
[1445.68 - 1452.00] fruit one dropper full
[1448.16 - 1453.92] i just put the one dropper full in okay
[1452.00 - 1455.76] right and then it has a couple more
[1453.92 - 1458.88] things it's got the chaga mushroom in
[1455.76 - 1460.80] here it's got the curcumin right there's
[1458.88 - 1461.68] the curcumin
[1460.80 - 1463.76] so
[1461.68 - 1466.08] that's what's incredible about this i
[1463.76 - 1469.68] see vitamin b12 so then there's the
[1466.08 - 1470.88] vitamin b12 it says one dropper full
[1469.68 - 1472.88] daily
[1470.88 - 1474.56] with the hot flashes just showing you
[1472.88 - 1477.60] guys how this works
[1474.56 - 1479.68] right and then zinc
[1477.60 - 1482.00] best thing there is on the market i know
[1479.68 - 1483.60] people ever since medical medium got the
[1482.00 - 1485.84] word out on the zinc
[1483.60 - 1487.60] because no one used ink it was very
[1485.84 - 1489.68] rarely used anywhere
[1487.60 - 1492.08] um store shelves would have some old
[1489.68 - 1495.04] zincs on there like like in whole foods
[1492.08 - 1497.36] it would sit there for two years
[1495.04 - 1499.04] i've heard from people that literally in
[1497.36 - 1500.80] health food stores where they have they
[1499.04 - 1502.32] years ago they've had to throw away the
[1500.80 - 1504.56] zinc off the shelves because it always
[1502.32 - 1505.92] went out of date nobody used zinc
[1504.56 - 1507.28] and then what happened is medical medium
[1505.92 - 1508.88] information taught everybody about the
[1507.28 - 1511.36] viruses and talked to everybody about
[1508.88 - 1513.44] how to use zinc and it exploded it now
[1511.36 - 1515.12] every single person's coming out their
[1513.44 - 1517.04] own zinc and it's got junk in it and
[1515.12 - 1518.88] garbage in it that's the zinc that's
[1517.04 - 1520.56] important so one dropper full of zinc in
[1518.88 - 1522.00] there i'm gonna add a little water to
[1520.56 - 1524.32] this protocol
[1522.00 - 1524.32] okay
[1525.20 - 1528.64] and
[1527.12 - 1531.04] that right there
[1528.64 - 1535.84] is an example
[1531.04 - 1535.84] of protocol use right there
[1537.36 - 1542.88] and it tastes pretty darn good
[1540.32 - 1544.64] doesn't taste that bad at all
[1542.88 - 1545.84] all right let's move on so that was
[1544.64 - 1549.44] something you guys let's go to
[1545.84 - 1549.44] neurological issues
[1549.52 - 1553.12] let's see here we are neurological
[1551.12 - 1554.56] symptoms right
[1553.12 - 1556.40] we're cleansing heal if you just got
[1554.56 - 1558.64] here we're doing supplement protocol
[1556.40 - 1560.48] we're using vimergy supplements i got
[1558.64 - 1562.08] alo2 in front of me right here i don't
[1560.48 - 1563.92] know if you guys can see this i'll show
[1562.08 - 1566.16] you how i can cut this open and do this
[1563.92 - 1566.16] right
[1566.88 - 1569.84] all right
[1568.16 - 1571.52] might do some vitamin c shock therapy
[1569.84 - 1573.28] while we're at it
[1571.52 - 1574.88] so what i do anyway i'll show you with
[1573.28 - 1576.56] the aloe in a second i just want to cut
[1574.88 - 1578.96] the tail off i always cut the tail off
[1576.56 - 1580.80] the plant right
[1578.96 - 1583.60] you know i'm not going to use
[1580.80 - 1585.84] that bit of aloe i mean you can you can
[1583.60 - 1587.44] squeeze that tail out absolutely you
[1585.84 - 1588.96] could put it on your skin you can do
[1587.44 - 1591.28] anything like that but i usually cut the
[1588.96 - 1592.88] little piece off the bottom there
[1591.28 - 1595.60] all right now i'll go into that a little
[1592.88 - 1595.60] bit more too
[1596.00 - 1600.88] now listen
[1597.28 - 1603.12] at 6 45 eastern
[1600.88 - 1605.68] 3 45
[1603.12 - 1608.16] right pacific i'm going to be on rumble
[1605.68 - 1609.68] exclusively exclusively i'm going to be
[1608.16 - 1613.20] talking about
[1609.68 - 1616.16] the tragedy of urine therapy
[1613.20 - 1617.92] tragedy of urine therapy so i'm going to
[1616.16 - 1620.48] talk about urine therapy
[1617.92 - 1621.44] at but it's only on rumble at 6 45
[1620.48 - 1623.04] eastern
[1621.44 - 1625.12] 3 45
[1623.04 - 1626.96] okay pacific time
[1625.12 - 1628.80] all right we're neurological symptoms
[1626.96 - 1632.00] now if i had
[1628.80 - 1633.76] tightness of the chest
[1632.00 - 1635.84] like you just feel the tightness in the
[1633.76 - 1638.08] chest whether it's anxiety
[1635.84 - 1640.32] exactly or not
[1638.08 - 1642.00] or just you feel tightness in the chest
[1640.32 - 1644.80] and you don't know why
[1642.00 - 1646.96] if i had trembling hands
[1644.80 - 1649.36] or had moments where it's in the middle
[1646.96 - 1650.80] of the day and the trembles come or
[1649.36 - 1653.68] three o'clock in the afternoon the
[1650.80 - 1655.92] trembles come or they're just there or
[1653.68 - 1657.60] you don't maybe they're maybe your hands
[1655.92 - 1658.80] are really still and there's no
[1657.60 - 1660.88] trembling
[1658.80 - 1663.20] right but yet what's happening is you
[1660.88 - 1665.04] feel like you're trembling inside
[1663.20 - 1667.68] neurological symptom
[1665.04 - 1669.92] fire twitches and spasms
[1667.68 - 1672.24] you know my eye
[1669.92 - 1674.80] or twitches and spasms here here
[1672.24 - 1676.56] twitches and spasms okay good to see you
[1674.80 - 1678.24] guys by the way we're live on telegram
[1676.56 - 1680.40] that's a thing medical medium just lives
[1678.24 - 1681.68] we don't we don't like to pre-record
[1680.40 - 1684.32] anything
[1681.68 - 1687.04] we don't like to pre-record anything we
[1684.32 - 1688.96] want it live live live
[1687.04 - 1690.24] that's how we do it i've been very

[1690.24 - 1693.76] performances
[1691.84 - 1695.92] and people wonder how does he do it
[1693.76 - 1697.12] because the podcast doctors won't do it
[1695.92 - 1698.48] no one else will do it they all
[1697.12 - 1700.08] pre-record everything and edit
[1698.48 - 1701.60] everything because they say the wrong
[1700.08 - 1702.56] thing every other second they don't know
[1701.60 - 1703.84] what they're saying and they have to
[1702.56 - 1705.04] kind of pre-record everything i
[1703.84 - 1707.60] understand that
[1705.04 - 1708.88] how does he do things live
[1707.60 - 1711.20] one reason is because spirit of
[1708.88 - 1713.04] compassion that's one reason because i'm
[1711.20 - 1714.64] hearing spirit of the compassion at the
[1713.04 - 1716.56] same time i'm working with you guys

[1719.92 - 1722.16] know
[1720.64 - 1723.92] all put together
[1722.16 - 1725.76] plus i'm not a lot of celery force right
[1723.92 - 1729.60] now so anyway
[1725.76 - 1731.76] twitches and spasms muscle weakness
[1729.60 - 1734.48] that's one right there your legs feel
[1731.76 - 1736.80] like sandbag you got you got the chronic
[1734.48 - 1739.36] fatigue syndrome your legs feel like
[1736.80 - 1741.12] they're sandbags they feel heavy your
[1739.36 - 1743.52] arms feel heavy

[1746.80 - 1748.96] maybe you had it once in a while in your
[1748.08 - 1750.00] life
[1748.96 - 1753.04] what about
[1750.00 - 1755.20] numb fingers tingles and numbness you
[1753.04 - 1756.72] just called it right here tingles and
[1755.20 - 1759.84] numbness in here
[1756.72 - 1763.36] right the tingles the numbness fingers
[1759.84 - 1766.16] toes numb toes numb fingers they go numb
[1763.36 - 1768.24] easy everything goes numb easy sometimes
[1766.16 - 1769.84] just randomly goes numb it's not just
[1768.24 - 1772.08] about how you're sitting or what you're
[1769.84 - 1773.92] doing right
[1772.08 - 1775.92] restless legs
[1773.92 - 1778.72] the nighttime restless legs right guys
[1775.92 - 1780.64] on telegram the nighttime restless legs
[1778.72 - 1783.44] that's a big one right there
[1780.64 - 1786.96] restlessness in general
[1783.44 - 1788.48] weakness of the limbs right
[1786.96 - 1790.24] right we talked about that a little bit
[1788.48 - 1791.76] with muscle weakness but weakness of the
[1790.24 - 1794.96] limbs too
[1791.76 - 1797.20] muscle spasms and aches and pains random
[1794.96 - 1799.60] aches and pains i feel like i'm 80 years
[1797.20 - 1801.28] old i feel like i'm 70 years old when i
[1799.60 - 1803.36] shouldn't be because i'm a young person
[1801.28 - 1805.12] i'm a young woman i'm a young guy aches
[1803.36 - 1806.64] and pains right
[1805.12 - 1808.88] and then so
[1806.64 - 1811.92] if physical injury has not occurred
[1808.88 - 1815.44] neurological symptoms are caused by the
[1811.92 - 1817.60] viral explosion of the 20th century that
[1815.44 - 1819.44] means that the viruses that we've been
[1817.60 - 1821.28] passed down from our family lines that
[1819.44 - 1823.52] we also contract that we pick up in
[1821.28 - 1825.36] restaurants that we pick up wherever we
[1823.52 - 1828.48] are we pick up in public bathrooms we
[1825.36 - 1830.56] pass along to others sexual transmission
[1828.48 - 1832.24] or intimate transmission or however we
[1830.56 - 1834.32] want to deal with the viral explosion
[1832.24 - 1837.44] that's happening today the simplexes the
[1834.32 - 1839.28] shingles the ebv's the hhv-6 the
[1837.44 - 1842.08] cytomegalovirus that's what we're
[1839.28 - 1844.56] talking about there okay that's part of
[1842.08 - 1847.44] the whole neurological symptom problem
[1844.56 - 1850.16] people don't realize their mononucleosis
[1847.44 - 1853.20] their mononucleosis is now their
[1850.16 - 1855.76] neurological symptoms now years later
[1853.20 - 1858.40] their mono that they had
[1855.76 - 1860.00] camped out inside their liver
[1858.40 - 1862.56] sat in there
[1860.00 - 1865.20] and then left the liver went to the
[1862.56 - 1868.80] thyroid and the reproductive system
[1865.20 - 1870.88] causing endometriosis and pcos in women
[1868.80 - 1871.68] with that went to the thyroid
[1870.88 - 1874.32] right
[1871.68 - 1875.92] started causing the hypothyroidism the
[1874.32 - 1877.60] hyperthyroidism the cysts and the
[1875.92 - 1880.40] nodules on the thyroid people don't know
[1877.60 - 1883.68] this the epstein bar and then the
[1880.40 - 1886.96] epstein bar leaves the thyroid
[1883.68 - 1890.08] it does leaves the thyroid and creates
[1886.96 - 1891.76] the neurological symptoms every body's
[1890.08 - 1894.16] dealing with and they get the fibro
[1891.76 - 1896.08] diagnosis the ra diagnosis they get the
[1894.16 - 1897.76] lupus diagnosis they get all the
[1896.08 - 1899.20] different diagnoses the neurological
[1897.76 - 1900.40] lyme over time or just have these
[1899.20 - 1902.32] symptoms
[1900.40 - 1904.72] that's the epstein bar
[1902.32 - 1906.80] so what do we do we want to kill off the
[1904.72 - 1908.56] epstein bar so i'm in the book right
[1906.80 - 1909.84] here so basically what it is is i got
[1908.56 - 1911.36] neurological symptoms that are
[1909.84 - 1912.80] unexplained it's not from physical
[1911.36 - 1914.96] injury the doctor checks out
[1912.80 - 1915.76] everything's okay
[1914.96 - 1917.60] right
[1915.76 - 1919.44] whether they give you a autoimmune
[1917.60 - 1921.44] diagnosis or not so what do i do so i'm
[1919.44 - 1925.12] in neurological symptoms and it's just
[1921.44 - 1927.04] aloe vera aloe vera two inch piece right
[1925.12 - 1929.68] so what i do is i cut this piece off
[1927.04 - 1931.92] first okay
[1929.68 - 1933.44] i'll cut that per piece off first right
[1931.92 - 1935.84] i'm gonna move the book for two seconds
[1933.44 - 1935.84] right here
[1936.24 - 1940.16] now i'm gonna cut a two-piece two inch
[1938.88 - 1941.52] i mean it's a little bigger than two
[1940.16 - 1943.92] inch maybe that's a bigger piece but
[1941.52 - 1945.76] somewhere around there right nice hunky
[1943.92 - 1948.64] piece off this aloe vera leaf this is
[1945.76 - 1951.04] part of the protocol right here you know
[1948.64 - 1953.04] i noticed that people say i did medical
[1951.04 - 1955.12] medium i didn't get better and then
[1953.04 - 1956.80] someone asked him like would you do
[1955.12 - 1958.80] well i don't know
[1956.80 - 1960.80] i was doing something i did i did celery
[1958.80 - 1961.68] juice for two weeks
[1960.80 - 1964.24] or
[1961.68 - 1966.72] i was on this guy this other guy's
[1964.24 - 1968.32] youtube and he he said to do this and to
[1966.72 - 1969.84] do that but i was still doing medical
[1968.32 - 1972.32] medium oh you were
[1969.84 - 1973.92] i think you were a dabbler and it's okay
[1972.32 - 1975.68] to be a dabbler there's nothing wrong
[1973.92 - 1977.68] with being a dabbler just
[1975.68 - 1980.40] realize have you really done the
[1977.68 - 1982.96] protocols have you learned have you done
[1980.40 - 1986.00] have you done the book right i just cut
[1982.96 - 1987.28] this big piece off right here huh
[1986.00 - 1991.64] and
[1987.28 - 1991.64] i forwarded it hey then
[1992.08 - 1996.96] what i love about the aloe
[1994.40 - 1998.40] it tastes so good so i just filleted
[1996.96 - 2001.40] this and this is how i filet it right
[1998.40 - 2001.40] here
[2005.52 - 2008.80] i think you just swallowed it almost all
[2006.88 - 2009.92] right
[2008.80 - 2011.68] now what you could do is you could take
[2009.92 - 2013.36] it out and you can throw in a blender
[2011.68 - 2014.80] flay it throw it in a blender and blend
[2013.36 - 2016.96] it up with some water you don't have to
[2014.80 - 2019.84] do what do it like i just did what i
[2016.96 - 2019.84] also do is
[2020.40 - 2025.20] i take a spoon
[2022.88 - 2026.64] and i'll i'll also scrape

[2051.52 - 2054.56] incredible
[2052.72 - 2057.04] tool right there right

[2065.12 - 2069.36] that's the that's the uh
[2067.52 - 2072.16] the medical medium dosage is one
[2069.36 - 2074.32] teaspoon or three capsules daily that's
[2072.16 - 2076.16] the vimergy barley grass juice powder
[2074.32 - 2077.60] right there
[2076.16 - 2080.96] cat's claw
[2077.60 - 2083.28] back to that again neurological symptoms
[2080.96 - 2086.24] it's calling for cat's claw cat's glock
[2083.28 - 2087.52] kills viruses
[2086.24 - 2089.36] okay
[2087.52 - 2091.20] but this is a lot to pick up right now
[2089.36 - 2092.48] throughout this live the book has the
[2091.20 - 2094.24] details
[2092.48 - 2095.28] make sure you're just you just have the
[2094.24 - 2096.08] book
[2095.28 - 2097.20] right
[2096.08 - 2100.24] i mean
[2097.20 - 2101.28] it's dirt cheap at amazon.com us right
[2100.24 - 2102.88] now
[2101.28 - 2105.28] i wake up every morning and i check and
[2102.88 - 2107.68] i go thank god it's still they're still
[2105.28 - 2109.52] doing this there's they still have it so
[2107.68 - 2111.36] priced so low
[2109.52 - 2114.16] for this book all right
[2111.36 - 2115.60] two dropper fulls twice a day of cat's
[2114.16 - 2118.08] claw
[2115.60 - 2120.72] two dropper fulls give you a little bit
[2118.08 - 2122.72] of run down what's a dropper full
[2120.72 - 2124.00] a dropper folds whatever goes into the
[2122.72 - 2126.48] dropper
[2124.00 - 2129.28] that's it that's a dropper full it's
[2126.48 - 2131.04] whatever goes into the dropper
[2129.28 - 2132.88] really important to know
[2131.04 - 2134.88] okay
[2132.88 - 2136.56] a half dropper full would be whatever
[2134.88 - 2137.92] that half of whatever you just came in
[2136.56 - 2140.56] there so that would be a half dropper
[2137.92 - 2140.56] hole right there
[2141.04 - 2145.12] that's an example so i just did two
[2143.12 - 2147.12] dropper holes of cat's claw right it
[2145.12 - 2149.44] says curcumin that's on the list what
[2147.12 - 2151.12] does it say about curcumin two capsules
[2149.44 - 2152.40] twice a day because what curcumin is and
[2151.12 - 2154.40] this is a high quality one so what
[2152.40 - 2156.80] curcumin does is it has
[2154.40 - 2160.00] anti-inflammatory properties it doesn't
[2156.80 - 2163.60] mean it kills viruses
[2160.00 - 2165.20] but it acts as aspirin
[2163.60 - 2168.88] curcumin
[2165.20 - 2171.36] acts like aspirin quality matters too
[2168.88 - 2173.04] it's critical right it's to help bring
[2171.36 - 2175.68] down a little bit of that viral
[2173.04 - 2178.88] inflammation that's why that's in there
[2175.68 - 2180.72] what else is in there right d-mannose
[2178.88 - 2183.28] so d-manos
[2180.72 - 2185.20] one tablespoon
[2183.28 - 2187.60] actually i mean that was in the wrong
[2185.20 - 2189.12] one right there sorry there's no d manos
[2187.60 - 2191.20] in this one
[2189.12 - 2192.16] all right we're in the right one now
[2191.20 - 2193.92] okay
[2192.16 - 2195.68] so yeah you got the cat squad we got
[2193.92 - 2196.88] that in there we got the curcumin that's
[2195.68 - 2198.64] in there too now we're going into
[2196.88 - 2200.48] goldenseal
[2198.64 - 2201.84] team i was an overactive bladder by the
[2200.48 - 2203.28] way for a second
[2201.84 - 2205.36] which is really an important one so i
[2203.28 - 2208.00] want to go to oracle that's why we're
[2205.36 - 2210.72] live that's why we do this live
[2208.00 - 2213.04] in hopes that happens
[2210.72 - 2214.88] the fun stuff happens right so for
[2213.04 - 2217.20] interstitial cystitis that's what the
[2214.88 - 2219.20] the demanos powder was but we'll talk
[2217.20 - 2221.12] about that in a minute so golden seal
[2219.20 - 2222.00] let's hit the golden seal one drop or a
[2221.12 - 2224.32] full
[2222.00 - 2226.72] twice a day
[2224.32 - 2227.84] put the dropper full in here
[2226.72 - 2230.88] that's the
[2227.84 - 2232.48] vimergy golden seal right there
[2230.88 - 2234.80] okay
[2232.48 - 2237.20] so we got that in there next one lemon
[2234.80 - 2239.60] balm lemon balm is antiviral but what i
[2237.20 - 2240.72] love about lemon balm is it calms the
[2239.60 - 2243.28] nerves
[2240.72 - 2245.28] so the lemon balm would be
[2243.28 - 2248.24] four dropper fulls
[2245.28 - 2251.28] four dropper fulls of the lemon balm for
[2248.24 - 2253.04] neurological problems so i just did four
[2251.28 - 2255.84] dropper folds right there now if you're
[2253.04 - 2257.76] sensitive you can take a drop if you're
[2255.84 - 2258.80] sensitive you can take a drop look at
[2257.76 - 2259.92] this ready
[2258.80 - 2261.12] one drop
[2259.92 - 2263.20] two drops
[2261.12 - 2265.12] three drops if you're sensitive look at
[2263.20 - 2266.80] that four drops
[2265.12 - 2270.48] okay
[2266.80 - 2272.72] i'm gonna give you guys a quick run down
[2270.48 - 2274.56] i watched it for decades
[2272.72 - 2275.68] no one healed no one healed from
[2274.56 - 2277.44] whatever they were diagnosed with
[2275.68 - 2278.88] candida whatever it was they had
[2277.44 - 2280.96] neurological problems didn't even know
[2278.88 - 2282.72] it was that they just stayed sick for
[2280.96 - 2285.28] decades i watched it out there when i
[2282.72 - 2287.52] was young and people came up with with
[2285.28 - 2289.04] glorious ideas you can try to eat this
[2287.52 - 2291.04] you can try to do this
[2289.04 - 2293.28] but people stayed sick
[2291.04 - 2295.84] the way you heal is you really know the
[2293.28 - 2297.60] details of intricate protocols that
[2295.84 - 2299.84] actually work and have a history of
[2297.60 - 2301.60] working and getting people's lives back
[2299.84 - 2304.48] that's how you heal
[2301.60 - 2306.40] intricate critical protocols that get
[2304.48 - 2308.08] people's lives back that have a history
[2306.40 - 2310.16] and a street cred
[2308.08 - 2313.20] that have already healed people around
[2310.16 - 2314.72] the world that's how people really heal
[2313.20 - 2316.48] because i've watched it for years people
[2314.72 - 2318.00] go into this place in this clinic and
[2316.48 - 2319.36] then they go here and then they go there
[2318.00 - 2321.92] and then they're trying this and trying
[2319.36 - 2324.80] that and they just stay sick
[2321.92 - 2327.68] it's so sad when i think about it
[2324.80 - 2329.12] it's so sad so we just put that in there
[2327.68 - 2331.60] let's see there's a few other things
[2329.12 - 2334.64] there's b12 there's vitamin c vitamin c
[2331.60 - 2337.12] is five capsules twice a day
[2334.64 - 2338.56] five capsules twice a day
[2337.12 - 2342.80] so
[2338.56 - 2344.96] i almost says but he's 31 years old
[2342.80 - 2348.56] so how does he how how has he seen it
[2344.96 - 2351.12] for decades when he's 31 years old
[2348.56 - 2352.56] i wish i was 31 years old that would be
[2351.12 - 2354.24] really awesome
[2352.56 - 2356.32] you know i wish spirit can do that for
[2354.24 - 2358.64] me spirit of compassion i wish he can
[2356.32 - 2361.28] just put me in a time machine and bring
[2358.64 - 2362.16] me back to when i was 31
[2361.28 - 2365.68] that was
[2362.16 - 2368.40] that was more than two decades ago more
[2365.68 - 2370.56] than two decades ago like
[2368.40 - 2372.96] way more right anyway
[2370.56 - 2374.96] zinc right there
[2372.96 - 2377.84] one dropper full twice a day i'm in the
[2374.96 - 2379.84] neurological symptom protocol you guys
[2377.84 - 2382.00] lucy says

[2404.40 - 2408.08] that's the technical uh term
[2406.80 - 2409.68] but but
[2408.08 - 2411.68] when you see people heal when they do
[2409.68 - 2413.44] protocols using high quality stuff like
[2411.68 - 2415.28] this it's like beyond it's like above

[2553.60 - 2558.32] even if you don't venture into the
[2556.08 - 2561.04] supplement protocol section in here but
[2558.32 - 2563.04] you just start one thing celery juice in
[2561.04 - 2565.52] the protocol section right there one
[2563.04 - 2567.28] thing celery juice you do a little bit
[2565.52 - 2569.04] of the aloe you learn some of these
[2567.28 - 2571.04] medical medium tools
[2569.04 - 2573.68] you can take yourself to that place
[2571.04 - 2576.96] you're getting yourself to that place
[2573.68 - 2579.04] right tammy strangs asks a question
[2576.96 - 2581.76] where do you start if you have multiple
[2579.04 - 2583.84] symptoms i have hot flashes ringing in
[2581.76 - 2586.16] the ear and nerve issues really good
[2583.84 - 2589.44] point you pick
[2586.16 - 2592.48] the one that looms over you the most
[2589.44 - 2594.24] which one looms over you the most right
[2592.48 - 2596.08] you got multiple symptoms is it hot
[2594.24 - 2597.28] flashes by the way you should you should
[2596.08 - 2598.72] watch this from the beginning the hot
[2597.28 - 2600.40] flash part maybe you did but you're
[2598.72 - 2601.92] wondering where should you start right
[2600.40 - 2603.36] ringing the ears say you're something
[2601.92 - 2605.20] you got ringing in the ears which is the
[2603.36 - 2607.92] inflammation of
[2605.20 - 2610.08] the labyrinth of the inner ear okay
[2607.92 - 2613.36] and it gets inflamed by epstein-barr
[2610.08 - 2614.72] creates um tinnitus get popping
[2613.36 - 2616.24] fluttering
[2614.72 - 2618.56] buzzing
[2616.24 - 2621.76] noises in here right whatever's going on
[2618.56 - 2623.68] or you get the ringing and that ringing
[2621.76 - 2626.64] people don't realize it when a fan is on
[2623.68 - 2628.40] the ring could actually change and make
[2626.64 - 2630.32] when different noises are happening the
[2628.40 - 2631.84] rain can get louder at night instead in
[2630.32 - 2633.28] the morning in the morning it's lower
[2631.84 - 2635.92] for a lot of people it gets louder at
[2633.28 - 2638.40] night this is viral nerve inflammation
[2635.92 - 2642.40] inside the ear i talk about it tinnitus
[2638.40 - 2644.72] is in here now which one looms the most
[2642.40 - 2647.44] that's the one you can start with if you
[2644.72 - 2650.16] like and what you'll notice
[2647.44 - 2652.88] when you work on the symptom
[2650.16 - 2655.12] that looms the most
[2652.88 - 2656.56] other symptoms start getting better and
[2655.12 - 2658.80] you're like what the heck is going on
[2656.56 - 2660.80] here why is everything starting to get
[2658.80 - 2662.88] better because guess what
[2660.80 - 2665.04] that epstein barr you had or that
[2662.88 - 2667.52] whatever that you have it's causing
[2665.04 - 2669.12] other problems that streptococcus you
[2667.52 - 2671.68] have that's giving you overactive
[2669.12 - 2673.36] bladder it's causing other problems
[2671.68 - 2676.40] let's go over overactive bladder while
[2673.36 - 2677.60] we got a chance
[2676.40 - 2679.52] okay
[2677.60 - 2680.96] there's protocols for over 200 symptoms
[2679.52 - 2682.88] and conditions we're going to go into
[2680.96 - 2685.68] oab
[2682.88 - 2686.88] is where we're going next
[2685.68 - 2689.84] you know i heard a commercial on the
[2686.88 - 2692.40] radio i was in the car the other day and
[2689.84 - 2694.48] are you suffering from oab
[2692.40 - 2696.48] overactive bladder
[2694.48 - 2697.68] come to our clinic we have different
[2696.48 - 2698.80] therapies
[2697.68 - 2701.12] and i'm like yeah i heard those
[2698.80 - 2702.48] therapies before i heard a lot of people
[2701.12 - 2705.20] going there too
[2702.48 - 2708.24] i've heard that for years they said you
[2705.20 - 2712.08] may be one of the very few people that
[2708.24 - 2713.20] find relief at our clinic for oab
[2712.08 - 2716.48] make sure
[2713.20 - 2719.20] you see our clinic for oab this message
[2716.48 - 2720.40] was brought to you by pictures
[2719.20 - 2722.24] and then all of a sudden the radio went
[2720.40 - 2725.04] on and some music went on you know the
[2722.24 - 2727.60] music went on and i'm like
[2725.04 - 2728.96] dear lord does anybody even stand a
[2727.60 - 2733.76] chance
[2728.96 - 2736.00] anyway oab i got it right here all right
[2733.76 - 2738.72] chronic inflammation of the bladder is
[2736.00 - 2741.92] due to a low-grade infection either
[2738.72 - 2744.16] years past or years present
[2741.92 - 2747.04] maybe not years present but present
[2744.16 - 2750.80] right interstitial cystitis right
[2747.04 - 2754.32] oab overactive bladder utis yeast
[2750.80 - 2756.64] infections bv bacterial vaginosis like
[2754.32 - 2758.88] all this stuff gets all tied in to
[2756.64 - 2761.36] overactive bladder by the way
[2758.88 - 2764.24] okay so
[2761.36 - 2767.04] one or more of the over 50 groups of
[2764.24 - 2769.84] streptococcus bacteria
[2767.04 - 2772.56] or even epstein-barr can fall into the
[2769.84 - 2774.72] category of oab because epstein-barr has
[2772.56 - 2777.04] so many toxins coming out of the liver
[2774.72 - 2780.08] that it gets into the kidneys eventually
[2777.04 - 2781.60] causing the the uh the pudendum nerve
[2780.08 - 2782.80] and other nerves around the bladder to
[2781.60 - 2785.36] get inflamed and then you have
[2782.80 - 2786.16] overactive bladder that's how it works
[2785.36 - 2788.96] right
[2786.16 - 2791.68] normally both a virus and bacteria are
[2788.96 - 2793.20] present in combination you guys
[2791.68 - 2795.60] working with each other in the same
[2793.20 - 2797.28] environment neurotoxins that the viruses
[2795.60 - 2799.04] release can irritate the lining of the
[2797.28 - 2801.76] bladder like i just told you
[2799.04 - 2804.16] while bacteria nestles themselves deep
[2801.76 - 2807.04] in the bladder lining deep in the
[2804.16 - 2808.56] bladder lining both causing inflammation
[2807.04 - 2812.08] at once
[2808.56 - 2812.08] i don't think i have a bladder prop
[2812.40 - 2816.40] i don't think i have a bladder oh yeah i
[2814.32 - 2818.56] do have a bladder prop i had to remove
[2816.40 - 2823.12] the bladder prop because
[2818.56 - 2825.68] because someone complained on tick tock
[2823.12 - 2828.16] that this was like
[2825.68 - 2830.48] sexual contact content or something or
[2828.16 - 2833.44] whatever on take the like the just
[2830.48 - 2835.28] having the anatomy dummy here
[2833.44 - 2837.68] so it's like well what do i do how many
[2835.28 - 2839.68] parts can i remove off this anatomy
[2837.68 - 2842.00] without a problem so yeah no i can't
[2839.68 - 2843.12] even show you the overactive bladder now
[2842.00 - 2845.68] the prop
[2843.12 - 2850.88] so in in the oab we got the fresh celery
[2845.68 - 2853.36] juice work up to 32 ounces right here
[2850.88 - 2854.24] we got the aloe vera
[2853.36 - 2855.76] right
[2854.24 - 2857.84] two inches
[2855.76 - 2859.36] i cut it right there before i don't want
[2857.84 - 2862.08] it dripping on the book i cut it on
[2859.36 - 2863.92] right i cut it you saw me eat that
[2862.08 - 2866.56] we have that in here
[2863.92 - 2868.08] barley grass juice powder one teaspoon
[2866.56 - 2869.60] that's the vimergy barley grass cheese
[2868.08 - 2871.12] powder i'm not sponsored if you guys
[2869.60 - 2874.56] just came on here
[2871.12 - 2876.80] right you're watching cat's claw
[2874.56 - 2878.88] right two dropper fulls twice a day
[2876.80 - 2882.00] curcumin two capsules twice a day d
[2878.88 - 2883.36] manos powder one tablespoon three times
[2882.00 - 2886.56] a day
[2883.36 - 2888.88] gaba isn't that interesting spirit of
[2886.56 - 2890.64] compassion wanted gaba
[2888.88 - 2892.32] for oab
[2890.64 - 2894.72] right gaba
[2892.32 - 2897.12] and i can't tell you how many times
[2894.72 - 2899.28] i've used that information family
[2897.12 - 2901.52] friends people throughout the years when
[2899.28 - 2903.36] you use gaba for oab
[2901.52 - 2905.96] something changes because a lot of
[2903.36 - 2907.68] people's oab over active bladder is
[2905.96 - 2910.64] neurological
[2907.68 - 2913.28] nerves they feel like they have to pee a
[2910.64 - 2915.44] hundred times because nerves are
[2913.28 - 2919.36] sensitized
[2915.44 - 2922.16] and gaba helps with sensitized nerves
[2919.36 - 2924.32] you can't find this information anywhere
[2922.16 - 2926.16] you can't medical medium information
[2924.32 - 2927.84] isn't common sense
[2926.16 - 2929.52] it's above common sense because common
[2927.84 - 2931.52] sense is actually just sense that
[2929.52 - 2933.36] everybody just naturally knows right
[2931.52 - 2936.32] you're raised like don't cross the
[2933.36 - 2937.28] street while the traffic is is really
[2936.32 - 2938.96] bad
[2937.28 - 2941.12] like when you're a baby when you're a
[2938.96 - 2942.56] child and you're holding on to mom's
[2941.12 - 2944.48] mommy's hand
[2942.56 - 2947.12] it's like don't cross the street yet you
[2944.48 - 2948.32] see the cars coming that's called common
[2947.12 - 2951.12] sense
[2948.32 - 2954.64] right everybody has common sense medical
[2951.12 - 2956.88] medium information just makes sense
[2954.64 - 2958.16] it makes sense when nothing else makes
[2956.88 - 2959.60] sense out there that's the difference
[2958.16 - 2961.68] between between medical medium
[2959.60 - 2962.80] information it's not common sense common
[2961.68 - 2963.76] sense is like
[2962.80 - 2965.76] don't
[2963.76 - 2969.04] jump off the cliff
[2965.76 - 2971.84] onto those raging rocks and water down
[2969.04 - 2973.68] there and and you know and waves
[2971.84 - 2977.04] you're gonna die if you do that that's
[2973.68 - 2980.24] common sense right you don't do a selfie
[2977.04 - 2982.40] while hanging on a tower
[2980.24 - 2985.60] don't do a selfie while hanging off a
[2982.40 - 2988.56] building you know hey guys wait hey wait
[2985.60 - 2991.12] i'm holding on here no wait wait guys no
[2988.56 - 2993.12] wait i'm doing a selfie yeah
[2991.12 - 2995.44] common sense is that
[2993.12 - 2996.96] right medical medium information makes
[2995.44 - 2998.40] sense
[2996.96 - 3000.56] and that's the whole point right it's
[2998.40 - 3002.80] above the common sense line you won't
[3000.56 - 3004.24] find information about how
[3002.80 - 3008.08] to
[3004.24 - 3010.08] heal oab by using gaba because medical
[3008.08 - 3011.36] research and science doesn't know that
[3010.08 - 3014.24] your
[3011.36 - 3016.80] overactive bladder could be neurological
[3014.24 - 3018.64] which is your pudendum nerves but more
[3016.80 - 3020.24] than that all the nerves going around in
[3018.64 - 3021.68] and out of the bladder and what you're
[3020.24 - 3023.68] what you're feeling what the reason why
[3021.68 - 3026.80] you have to pee every second is you're
[3023.68 - 3029.28] actually you're feeling sensitized
[3026.80 - 3031.04] nerves you can't find that anywhere and
[3029.28 - 3032.48] that's why people heal around the world
[3031.04 - 3034.56] it's incredible
[3032.48 - 3037.28] so we got the the protocol in here it's
[3034.56 - 3039.28] magnesium glycinate is in that protocol
[3037.28 - 3041.12] so that's the vimergy magnesium
[3039.28 - 3043.36] glycinate right there if you guys just
[3041.12 - 3045.28] came on here two things someday you
[3043.36 - 3047.84] might want to get in your life
[3045.28 - 3050.80] one is the cleanse the heel book another
[3047.84 - 3053.04] is high quality subs this is vimergy you
[3050.80 - 3055.44] find this stuff at vimrgy.com whatever
[3053.04 - 3058.08] and high quality subs and learn
[3055.44 - 3060.24] protocols to move yourself forward right
[3058.08 - 3061.92] but either way if you have the book
[3060.24 - 3063.28] that's an incredible start because you
[3061.92 - 3065.20] can start with the cleanses you can
[3063.28 - 3067.68] start with the knowledge there the
[3065.20 - 3070.00] information so i'm an overactive bladder
[3067.68 - 3071.92] so magnesium glycinate so here we are
[3070.00 - 3074.24] melatonin
[3071.92 - 3075.68] is in overactive bladder
[3074.24 - 3077.44] interesting
[3075.68 - 3081.28] i'll tell you why
[3077.44 - 3083.28] because you get ocd
[3081.28 - 3084.40] with overactive bladder if you're
[3083.28 - 3088.32] somebody
[3084.40 - 3090.08] that has the ocd overactive bladder i
[3088.32 - 3092.32] peed
[3090.08 - 3093.92] but i know i'm gonna have to pee again
[3092.32 - 3095.68] in five minutes
[3093.92 - 3096.96] i can't go to bed yet i'm just starting
[3095.68 - 3098.72] to fall asleep
[3096.96 - 3100.08] and i have to pee again i'm just
[3098.72 - 3102.08] starting to fall asleep and i have to
[3100.08 - 3104.64] pee again wait i'm falling asleep but i
[3102.08 - 3108.16] have to pee again i just peed five more
[3104.64 - 3109.68] times it's now 11 45 at night and i'm i
[3108.16 - 3111.28] think i can just i think i'm good i
[3109.68 - 3112.96] don't have to pee again
[3111.28 - 3116.96] and then you have to pee again and now
[3112.96 - 3119.04] you're off doing that right there okay
[3116.96 - 3121.28] the melatonin is helpful for that
[3119.04 - 3125.20] helpful for the brain to try to break
[3121.28 - 3126.64] the ocd aspect of overactive bladder
[3125.20 - 3127.92] look if i didn't cover your illness
[3126.64 - 3130.00] today i didn't cover you know if i
[3127.92 - 3131.52] didn't cover ms if it didn't cover fibro
[3130.00 - 3134.72] ra or whatever that's going on or your
[3131.52 - 3136.88] autoimmune or constipation or or cysts
[3134.72 - 3138.48] protocol in here or multiple sclerosis
[3136.88 - 3140.56] or like i said autoimmune
[3138.48 - 3141.92] if i didn't they're all it's all in here
[3140.56 - 3143.60] i'm just covering some of them if you're
[3141.92 - 3145.36] somebody with overactive bladder great
[3143.60 - 3146.96] if you don't have overactive bladder
[3145.36 - 3148.96] fine i mean i'm in here right now and i
[3146.96 - 3150.64] just see pandas right here just right
[3148.96 - 3152.08] here it's pandas
[3150.64 - 3153.52] yeah people are like what this medical
[3152.08 - 3155.44] medium doesn't know anything about
[3153.52 - 3156.40] pandas just our pandas community does
[3155.44 - 3158.08] really
[3156.40 - 3159.28] and then you know you go into the pandas
[3158.08 - 3160.80] community and you look and it's like
[3159.28 - 3163.04] everybody's clueless
[3160.80 - 3165.28] and you feel so bad you feel bad for the
[3163.04 - 3167.36] moms you feel bad for the kids you feel
[3165.28 - 3168.96] bad for them all because they don't even
[3167.36 - 3170.72] know what to do
[3168.96 - 3172.56] and and it's so sad and here's the
[3170.72 - 3175.04] pandas section right here
[3172.56 - 3176.96] no you know this is it right here it's
[3175.04 - 3178.32] it's streptococcus infection right
[3176.96 - 3179.28] associated that's the whole thing where
[3178.32 - 3182.80] they say it's associated with
[3179.28 - 3185.12] streptococcus infection true cause
[3182.80 - 3186.96] a co-infection of one or more strains
[3185.12 - 3189.92] from over 50 groups of streptococcus
[3186.96 - 3192.64] bacteria plus a virus most commonly
[3189.92 - 3195.12] hhv-6 you know why kids don't heal with
[3192.64 - 3197.12] pandas it's rare they can do unless they
[3195.12 - 3198.56] use like certain protocol like pieces
[3197.12 - 3201.20] that they've gotten from medical medium
[3198.56 - 3202.40] in the last 35 years the reason why kids
[3201.20 - 3205.04] don't heal
[3202.40 - 3207.36] well at all from pandas is because they
[3205.04 - 3209.84] just think it's strep and then their
[3207.36 - 3215.56] strep protocols aren't even correct
[3209.84 - 3215.56] that's why because pandas is hhv-6
[3216.52 - 3221.12] co-infection
[3218.24 - 3222.40] is strep to coctus see the difference
[3221.12 - 3223.92] right there
[3222.40 - 3226.08] so
[3223.92 - 3228.88] the co-infection
[3226.08 - 3231.36] even epstein-barr in hhv6 right and
[3228.88 - 3234.48] that's medical medium information okay
[3231.36 - 3237.60] and then toxic heavy metals is the other
[3234.48 - 3239.44] aspect of pandas that's how you heal
[3237.60 - 3242.00] pandas you get the metals out you get
[3239.44 - 3243.76] the co-infections down
[3242.00 - 3246.96] right does it have anything to do with
[3243.76 - 3249.68] mycotoxin poisoning that's a trigger so
[3246.96 - 3251.92] so so so mycotoxins that's that's an
[3249.68 - 3254.88] actual trigger so any kind of mold any
[3251.92 - 3257.28] kind of mold exposure that's an actual
[3254.88 - 3260.00] trigger to lower the immune system and
[3257.28 - 3262.64] then the real infectious problems about
[3260.00 - 3264.72] pandas are the real problems that creep
[3262.64 - 3265.68] up
[3264.72 - 3267.28] look
[3265.68 - 3268.88] maybe right now this isn't important to
[3267.28 - 3270.24] a lot of people and they're just like oh
[3268.88 - 3272.16] just go
[3270.24 - 3275.12] look for some other info or whatever but
[3272.16 - 3276.96] you know when i'm gone down the road
[3275.12 - 3279.12] and and it's gonna be a bigger sea of
[3276.96 - 3280.48] confusion than anyone's ever seen before
[3279.12 - 3281.60] in history because i've been told this
[3280.48 - 3283.52] over and over again by spirit of
[3281.60 - 3286.40] compassion and it's the biggest sea of
[3283.52 - 3286.40] confusion ever
[3286.72 - 3290.08] someone's going to have this book
[3288.96 - 3291.36] and they're going to be able to save
[3290.08 - 3293.20] their life
[3291.36 - 3295.20] and that's what i think about every day
