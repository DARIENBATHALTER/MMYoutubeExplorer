[0.08 - 5.60] live live on facebook live on youtube
[3.20 - 7.20] making a potato bowl it's gonna have
[5.60 - 9.36] some nice onion in there
[7.20 - 11.36] it's gonna have asparagus see i got
[9.36 - 13.44] beautiful asparagus right here you guys
[11.36 - 15.12] and it's gonna have potatoes too so i'm
[13.44 - 16.80] gonna chop up some asparagus and get it
[15.12 - 20.64] going right away
[16.80 - 21.92] we're talking about today how incredibly
[20.64 - 25.44] important it is
[21.92 - 28.24] when you're sick that everything you do
[25.44 - 30.00] matters right we don't want to go 10
[28.24 - 33.28] steps ahead
[30.00 - 36.00] and then go 25 steps
[33.28 - 37.28] backwards we don't want to do that right
[36.00 - 39.84] we want to go
[37.28 - 40.48] ahead and if we go backwards a little
[39.84 - 42.16] bit
[40.48 - 44.16] it's only in the natural process of
[42.16 - 47.12] healing and then we go ahead even
[44.16 - 48.40] more so it's like the three steps up two
[47.12 - 51.28] steps back sometimes
[48.40 - 51.84] boom three steps up again two steps back
[51.28 - 54.48] right
[51.84 - 55.28] three steps up again two steps back
[54.48 - 58.64] right
[55.28 - 61.92] and we don't wanna go ahead
[58.64 - 65.04] we don't want to go three steps up
[61.92 - 66.40] 25 30 steps back and that's what's
[65.04 - 67.92] happening with so many people trying to

[200.32 - 203.60] right here i'm going to get it cooking
[204.24 - 208.24] yeah so we're doing that
[210.96 - 216.24] um let me go get a utensil too
[214.00 - 218.24] cooking utensil that would be nice to
[216.24 - 220.56] have one there
[218.24 - 222.32] i got asparagus in the pan so you guys
[220.56 - 225.52] it looks like we're censored
[222.32 - 227.20] tonight to a point that's to a level
[225.52 - 229.44] i've never seen before
[227.20 - 232.00] so there's only 200 people on in total
[229.44 - 235.36] between youtube and facebook
[232.00 - 238.48] so we are actually we're actually
[235.36 - 242.40] super duper uh super duper
[238.48 - 244.32] censored so this is very interesting
[242.40 - 246.24] um that means no one's allowed to come
[244.32 - 248.48] on tonight so if you guys made it on
[246.24 - 249.84] it's a miracle i'm just letting you know
[248.48 - 254.40] it's a miracle
[249.84 - 257.12] um so anyway
[254.40 - 260.16] seriously that's like as censoring as
[257.12 - 260.16] censoring can ever be
[260.24 - 266.08] well look it's an intimate small crowd
[263.84 - 268.08] it's good i like that too so i don't
[266.08 - 269.84] mind so i'm gonna get the lid on here
[268.08 - 272.00] just moving around getting it to kind of
[269.84 - 274.56] take so i got some asparagus i'm
[272.00 - 276.80] steaming up i'm making a potato bowl
[274.56 - 278.08] and i want to tell you guys first of all
[276.80 - 280.96] what i do every day
[278.08 - 282.88] right or every other day and so forth i
[280.96 - 284.96] take a bunch of potatoes i cook them up
[282.88 - 286.80] i steam them up right in a steamer right
[284.96 - 288.40] and i have all these potatoes and then i
[286.80 - 290.80] put them in the fridge
[288.40 - 293.44] and i don't put a lid on them in the
[290.80 - 296.48] fridge because the potatoes can get
[293.44 - 300.08] kind of spongy right so
[296.48 - 300.56] i don't like to um i don't like to put a
[300.08 - 302.80] lid
[300.56 - 303.76] on a bowl and have potatoes in it that
[302.80 - 306.64] way
[303.76 - 308.24] i like having the lid off the bowl when
[306.64 - 310.40] it sits in the fridge so when i steam a
[308.24 - 312.88] whole bunch of potatoes
[310.40 - 314.16] i like them kind of like dry like a
[312.88 - 316.16] little bit dry
[314.16 - 317.36] and to do that as i put them in the
[316.16 - 318.48] fridge it's just the way i like it you
[317.36 - 320.48] might like it where they're
[318.48 - 322.40] moist after you steam them and they're
[320.48 - 323.20] moist right you might be somebody that
[322.40 - 326.80] likes that way
[323.20 - 329.76] hi monica glad you're coming on there um
[326.80 - 330.96] and so what i like to do is keep them
[329.76 - 334.16] kind of like in the fridge
[330.96 - 336.24] with the cover off right of a bowl
[334.16 - 337.76] or you know no saran wrap on there or
[336.24 - 339.36] anything like that and then i like i
[337.76 - 339.84] like the air just getting to them in the
[339.36 - 342.48] fridge
[339.84 - 344.80] and then they stay where they stay in a
[342.48 - 346.08] way where they keep dry inside
[344.80 - 348.08] just a little trick i want to give you
[346.08 - 348.88] right now nicholas says how long do you
[348.08 - 350.24] steam them
[348.88 - 352.16] you got to steam them until the fork
[350.24 - 353.76] goes through them right that's what you
[352.16 - 355.92] want to do
[353.76 - 357.60] you don't want them hard in the center
[355.92 - 359.68] you want to steam them and it
[357.60 - 361.12] it depends on where you are what
[359.68 - 364.00] altitude you're in
[361.12 - 365.76] right and around the world could be at a
[364.00 - 368.88] higher altitude lower altitude
[365.76 - 370.64] so can't i can't give you a time because
[368.88 - 372.72] it may not be the same time
[370.64 - 373.84] right and you might have hard water you
[372.72 - 375.92] might have
[373.84 - 377.04] soft water all these things make a
[375.92 - 378.48] difference right so
[377.04 - 380.40] when you're steaming but you want to
[378.48 - 382.00] steam them till the fork goes through
[380.40 - 384.16] right you want to catch them
[382.00 - 385.12] you don't want to overcook your potatoes
[384.16 - 386.56] but you want to make sure they're
[385.12 - 388.64] steamed all the way through
[386.56 - 390.32] so your fork goes through right so that
[388.64 - 391.68] could be 45 minutes for someone it could
[390.32 - 392.72] be 40 minutes for someone
[391.68 - 394.00] depending on where they live what kind
[392.72 - 395.76] of water they're using it could be an
[394.00 - 397.36] hour this is in you know important
[395.76 - 399.76] information right
[397.36 - 400.96] and so these are steamed potatoes
[399.76 - 403.36] they're already steamed
[400.96 - 405.60] and then i like have it i have like this
[403.36 - 407.52] big bowl of steamed potatoes right guys
[405.60 - 408.88] and then i could use them in the way i
[407.52 - 410.16] need to use them
[408.88 - 412.32] where i could use them for different
[410.16 - 414.96] things and i'm going to reheat them
[412.32 - 416.32] in this pan in a little while and make a
[414.96 - 418.40] potato bowl so
[416.32 - 419.68] i'm excited all right so i got the
[418.40 - 423.28] asparagus steaming
[419.68 - 425.92] right here yeah
[423.28 - 427.60] 27 minutes for you chris wood really
[425.92 - 430.56] when you steam potatoes
[427.60 - 432.24] wow just saw ashley kevin hey ashley

[437.60 - 441.84] uh got this to this steaming so let's
[440.00 - 444.00] talk about some fun stuff
[441.84 - 445.44] and cover some important information
[444.00 - 446.80] right what happens
[445.44 - 450.00] with what's going on out there there's
[446.80 - 453.52] so much information just swimming around
[450.00 - 457.04] in the alternative arts right
[453.52 - 460.48] so what happens is you get sick okay
[457.04 - 462.08] you go to your conventional doctor right
[460.48 - 464.08] and your conventional doctor is like
[462.08 - 467.12] let's just try to figure this out
[464.08 - 468.64] and you're in for the ride okay it
[467.12 - 469.12] happens to people who are really sick
[468.64 - 470.64] where
[469.12 - 472.88] or they're getting sicker they're in for
[470.64 - 473.68] the ride now doctor wants to draw some
[472.88 - 476.72] blood
[473.68 - 478.08] they take a little too much blood you
[476.72 - 480.72] know they take a little too much
[478.08 - 481.92] blood they're taking five full vials
[480.72 - 484.80] seven full vials
[481.92 - 486.24] 10 or 12 or 14 full vials and they start
[484.80 - 488.00] removing your immune system right
[486.24 - 489.28] without realizing it without even
[488.00 - 490.72] knowing what's wrong with you to begin
[489.28 - 491.20] with so they start removing your white

[500.24 - 504.16] your doctor
[501.28 - 505.76] about like half files and so forth
[504.16 - 507.36] because the labs take half files the
[505.76 - 508.96] labs take quarter vials right
[507.36 - 510.64] and then maybe scheduling more
[508.96 - 512.08] appointments at the doctor for blood
[510.64 - 513.76] work where you're doing some tests so
[512.08 - 516.16] you divide the tests
[513.76 - 517.76] um elena anthony my white blood count
[516.16 - 520.24] went back to normal range
[517.76 - 520.96] after your protocol and supplements and

[537.52 - 541.12] blood work

[667.04 - 670.56] it the keto diet well you got off
[668.64 - 673.44] processed foods so that's helping
[670.56 - 675.20] is it maybe you went vegan and you know
[673.44 - 676.00] you because of you went vegan you got
[675.20 - 679.36] off all these
[676.00 - 680.56] processed foods right fried foods maybe
[679.36 - 682.08] you're trying a bunch of different
[680.56 - 683.04] supplements so your doctors are loading
[682.08 - 684.40] you up with all these different
[683.04 - 685.60] supplements and maybe there's something
[684.40 - 687.68] in some of those supplements that's
[685.60 - 690.72] actually giving you something yeah
[687.68 - 694.40] but there's also things that we get hurt
[690.72 - 697.52] by that sends us back right i've seen
[694.40 - 700.80] for years good hearted good
[697.52 - 702.96] compassionate natural doctors
[700.80 - 704.24] or naturopaths or really good
[702.96 - 707.36] chiropractors
[704.24 - 708.72] or you know good md's right whatever
[707.36 - 711.44] that are giving out all these
[708.72 - 712.48] supplements they wholeheartedly want you
[711.44 - 715.60] better
[712.48 - 718.72] they want you to heal but there's
[715.60 - 719.92] alcohol in all their supplements alcohol
[718.72 - 722.48] i've seen this for years
[719.92 - 723.60] okay i've seen this in the alternative
[722.48 - 726.72] healing arts
[723.60 - 729.84] with uh with a natural doctor
[726.72 - 731.04] out there okay that has a lot of
[729.84 - 734.40] programs out
[731.04 - 737.68] all right and but was just
[734.40 - 739.60] constantly dumping all these alcohol
[737.68 - 741.44] you know all these alcohol filled
[739.60 - 743.92] supplements and
[741.44 - 746.96] that's already a no-no you can't get
[743.92 - 749.44] someone to the finish line
[746.96 - 750.96] when maybe one person you'll get close
[749.44 - 752.40] enough because you're doing all these
[750.96 - 754.96] other good things
[752.40 - 756.72] but the alcohol supplements will it will
[754.96 - 758.16] stop somebody from getting to the finish
[756.72 - 759.76] line and then we go backwards
[758.16 - 761.52] or that's just one thing right just
[759.76 - 764.48] using it as an example
[761.52 - 765.68] and so and and then there's the whole
[764.48 - 767.12] thing where
[765.68 - 768.72] when someone gets sick and they're
[767.12 - 769.92] really getting sick and they're really
[768.72 - 772.16] sensitive
[769.92 - 774.72] and anything could kick him downhill and
[772.16 - 777.12] then now we're in the land of the lost
[774.72 - 779.68] and it matters like we can lose
[777.12 - 780.96] ourselves we can lose ourselves in that
[779.68 - 784.08] fight
[780.96 - 785.60] um kim kim pave said

[818.16 - 824.48] uh oh karen churchill was diagnosed with
[821.60 - 824.88] 15 autoimmune diseases dot dot having
[824.48 - 827.60] follow
[824.88 - 829.20] followed aw that number is going down
[827.60 - 831.52] one after the other
[829.20 - 832.96] even had my doctor say i could not heal
[831.52 - 836.24] from diabetes
[832.96 - 838.56] incredible really incredible um
[836.24 - 839.68] i gotta play onion games lorraine
[838.56 - 842.72] lorraine
[839.68 - 844.24] i have to play onion games again so
[842.72 - 846.00] letting you know the onion games are
[844.24 - 847.92] going to actually happen with this meal
[846.00 - 850.32] um and michelle i think michelle said
[847.92 - 853.36] that too ichoda you're here tonight
[850.32 - 856.40] amazing so
[853.36 - 857.92] um anyway guys we're talking about how
[856.40 - 859.44] to protect yourselves what to look out
[857.92 - 860.48] for you don't want to go 10 steps
[859.44 - 862.64] forward
[860.48 - 863.84] and 25 steps back you don't want to go
[862.64 - 866.56] three steps forward and
[863.84 - 867.84] 10 steps back right you want to go three
[866.56 - 869.92] steps forward
[867.84 - 870.88] another three steps forward another two
[869.92 - 872.88] steps forward
[870.88 - 873.92] another one step forward another two
[872.88 - 875.20] steps back
[873.92 - 877.36] but you're already way ahead of where
[875.20 - 878.72] you were when you started and then boom
[877.36 - 879.36] three steps forward again now you're one
[878.72 - 882.48] more step
[879.36 - 883.44] ahead of the two steps right and so it's
[882.48 - 885.36] this whole thing
[883.44 - 886.96] even if it feels like you went 10 steps
[885.36 - 888.40] back
[886.96 - 890.32] but you're healing and moving forward
[888.40 - 891.84] than you ever did and i want to talk
[890.32 - 894.08] about something else but we don't want
[891.84 - 896.48] to really go backwards and we
[894.08 - 898.40] never get to heal and we're stuck and we
[896.48 - 899.76] can't go forward and we never get to be
[898.40 - 901.44] where we need to be
[899.76 - 903.52] we can't get there we don't want to go
[901.44 - 907.36] there we don't want to be there right
[903.52 - 909.92] really important um
[907.36 - 911.20] so let's go into a different aspect of
[909.92 - 913.52] this which is critical let me get the
[911.20 - 915.84] white blood cells in the cpc off my
[913.52 - 916.64] my little counter here my little uh
[915.84 - 919.52] board
[916.64 - 920.72] and let's talk about like some of the
[919.52 - 924.32] fundamental
[920.72 - 925.84] like like rules i could call them roles
[924.32 - 926.64] i guess right because we can make our
[925.84 - 930.16] own rules
[926.64 - 932.72] right and we can make our own
[930.16 - 934.08] way right and we can choose what we're
[932.72 - 935.52] what what we want to do in medical
[934.08 - 937.52] medium information what direction we
[935.52 - 939.84] want to go in right and one of the re
[937.52 - 940.64] one of the ways i do it with friends or
[939.84 - 943.36] family
[940.64 - 944.48] that decide hey i want to do this right
[943.36 - 945.36] a friend will call me up i haven't
[944.48 - 948.40] talked to in years
[945.36 - 950.96] be like look i need to heal
[948.40 - 952.32] i'm really sick what do i do and i'd be
[950.96 - 954.16] like first of all
[952.32 - 955.60] get rid of the troublemaker foods how
[954.16 - 959.28] many troublemaker foods
[955.60 - 960.48] can you ace or 86 how many troublemaker
[959.28 - 963.20] foods can you
[960.48 - 963.84] get out right like which ones my friend
[963.20 - 967.04] be like well
[963.84 - 970.16] what do you mean like milk cheese butter
[967.04 - 972.48] okay that's important right there for
[970.16 - 974.80] troublemaker foods
[972.48 - 974.80] and
[976.80 - 984.56] and you know so for example like
[980.84 - 987.60] okay everybody loves the cheese sticks
[984.56 - 989.76] right they love the cheese sticks i got
[987.60 - 992.00] some cheese sticks here right
[989.76 - 993.52] everybody loves their eggs it's a half
[992.00 - 994.80] hard-boiled egg right everybody loves
[993.52 - 998.56] your cookies
[994.80 - 1000.40] everybody loves their bread right
[998.56 - 1002.08] okay that's one there everybody loves
[1000.40 - 1002.56] their chocolate too right their ice
[1002.08 - 1004.24] creams
[1002.56 - 1005.76] everybody loves all that and it's like
[1004.24 - 1007.04] what can we remove
[1005.76 - 1008.48] right some of you guys are like that's
[1007.04 - 1009.84] easy i don't need any of that but then
[1008.48 - 1011.12] i'll talk about other stuff too that we
[1009.84 - 1013.44] got to worry about
[1011.12 - 1015.04] um and in a friend of mine like what do
[1013.44 - 1017.36] you mean i can't have cheese
[1015.04 - 1018.72] so okay i don't eat cheese that's what
[1017.36 - 1020.32] they'll say right i've heard this a
[1018.72 - 1022.00] million times i don't eat cheese
[1020.32 - 1023.36] i hardly eat cheese i don't eat cheese
[1022.00 - 1024.08] meanwhile if you really go through
[1023.36 - 1026.16] everything
[1024.08 - 1027.76] that they ate that week there's cheese
[1026.16 - 1029.36] everywhere it's like oh yeah they had a
[1027.76 - 1030.72] slice of pizza sure they had something
[1029.36 - 1032.40] else they had a salad with cheese
[1030.72 - 1033.60] crumbled cheese on top right they had
[1032.40 - 1035.20] something with blue cheese they had
[1033.60 - 1036.80] something with something else they had a
[1035.20 - 1038.64] you know whatever it is cheese is
[1036.80 - 1041.84] everywhere okay pasta
[1038.64 - 1043.28] with cheese on there right and so
[1041.84 - 1045.68] that's one thing right there that just
[1043.28 - 1047.60] has to go if you want to heal it's about
[1045.68 - 1048.80] moving some of these these things out
[1047.60 - 1050.72] these are basics though
[1048.80 - 1052.08] they weren't basics they weren't basics
[1050.72 - 1054.88] 35 years ago
[1052.08 - 1056.32] right people wanted to chop off my head
[1054.88 - 1057.68] when i would say you got to get rid of
[1056.32 - 1061.60] the cheese it was so
[1057.68 - 1063.84] foreign so foreign and so unbelievable
[1061.60 - 1066.64] people would look look at you in
[1063.84 - 1069.92] disbelief you're even saying remove the
[1066.64 - 1071.68] cheese 25 30 years ago 20 years ago like
[1069.92 - 1073.76] remove the cheese what
[1071.68 - 1075.20] and you know and that's that's how it
[1073.76 - 1076.24] works and then the gluten too
[1075.20 - 1077.92] there's another thing you want to get
[1076.24 - 1078.48] the gluten out of there austin you're on
[1077.92 - 1080.96] tonight
[1078.48 - 1081.92] good to see you get the gluten out get
[1080.96 - 1084.64] the cheese out
[1081.92 - 1085.28] get the milk get the butter out you
[1084.64 - 1088.24] can't
[1085.28 - 1089.28] heal and still eat butter now someone
[1088.24 - 1090.80] will disagree
[1089.28 - 1093.68] someone will disagree with that right
[1090.80 - 1095.20] there someone will say that's not true
[1093.68 - 1096.80] i got off the processed foods i got off
[1095.20 - 1100.16] of fried foods
[1096.80 - 1103.28] i started eating a very healthy organic
[1100.16 - 1105.28] pasture-raised diet i started you know
[1103.28 - 1107.84] taking care of myself i got this
[1105.28 - 1108.80] incredible you know cheap incredible
[1107.84 - 1112.08] butter
[1108.80 - 1115.76] right i got this great butter and i
[1112.08 - 1117.60] churned it myself right which is better
[1115.76 - 1119.12] than buying store-bought butter
[1117.60 - 1120.00] definitely and better than buying butter
[1119.12 - 1122.24] that's not good
[1120.00 - 1123.52] i raised the animals myself or i bought
[1122.24 - 1125.28] it from a farm where i
[1123.52 - 1126.64] take care of the animals they raise the
[1125.28 - 1129.20] animals and i can
[1126.64 - 1130.08] you know and the butter is so good and
[1129.20 - 1133.36] i'm healing
[1130.08 - 1136.16] well then you you just aren't that sick
[1133.36 - 1137.20] you're just not that sick one thing what
[1136.16 - 1139.92] people will do too
[1137.20 - 1141.36] is to state their case they'll say they
[1139.92 - 1144.64] were sicker than they
[1141.36 - 1146.72] were now in all fairness
[1144.64 - 1147.84] anybody who's sick with a symptom i'm
[1146.72 - 1150.40] fighting for
[1147.84 - 1151.44] always remember that but i also know the
[1150.40 - 1154.40] reality
[1151.44 - 1156.48] when it comes to stating your case on
[1154.40 - 1157.28] social media i've seen a lot of people
[1156.48 - 1158.80] where
[1157.28 - 1161.36] and i've talked first of all i've talked
[1158.80 - 1163.12] to a lot of doctors that know
[1161.36 - 1164.40] their patients cases right and
[1163.12 - 1166.08] everything i took a lot of different
[1164.40 - 1168.08] people and i've heard from
[1166.08 - 1169.36] all kinds of people along the way too
[1168.08 - 1171.12] professionals that
[1169.36 - 1172.72] tell me well this person yeah they got
[1171.12 - 1173.68] some fatigue but it's nothing like this
[1172.72 - 1175.60] person who can't
[1173.68 - 1177.60] budge and get out of bed so see the
[1175.60 - 1178.72] differences but yet the person who's got
[1177.60 - 1183.12] fatigue
[1178.72 - 1184.72] might might might actually express
[1183.12 - 1186.32] that they can't get out of bed but
[1184.72 - 1187.76] they're out every day
[1186.32 - 1189.36] right they're out of they're living
[1187.76 - 1190.80] their life still you know
[1189.36 - 1192.08] and i get it there's moments where they
[1190.80 - 1193.28] probably can't get out of bed there's
[1192.08 - 1195.04] moments where they're stuck
[1193.28 - 1196.96] but then there's somebody who's really
[1195.04 - 1197.68] stuck like really stuck where they get
[1196.96 - 1200.24] out and they're like
[1197.68 - 1200.88] can't even they can't even get through a
[1200.24 - 1203.28] kitchen
[1200.88 - 1205.12] chore they couldn't even imagine being
[1203.28 - 1207.44] here and doing this
[1205.12 - 1208.16] like for like a half an hour it's not
[1207.44 - 1209.76] going to happen
[1208.16 - 1211.68] right but then you can get somebody
[1209.76 - 1212.00] who's yeah they got fatigued yes they're
[1211.68 - 1213.44] sick
[1212.00 - 1214.72] yeah they got some low-grade viral
[1213.44 - 1216.08] infections yeah all the things that
[1214.72 - 1216.88] medical medium information is about
[1216.08 - 1219.36] right
[1216.88 - 1221.60] but they're able to actually still take
[1219.36 - 1223.28] care of themselves they're able to still
[1221.60 - 1224.88] do things they're able still to function
[1223.28 - 1228.16] right but
[1224.88 - 1230.80] but and you know and that kind of person
[1228.16 - 1231.76] might go on this clean diet right and
[1230.80 - 1235.04] then do this
[1231.76 - 1235.92] homemade butter thing and be like i'm
[1235.04 - 1237.52] getting better
[1235.92 - 1239.60] i'm getting healthier i'm doing the
[1237.52 - 1240.48] clean butter but when you when you're
[1239.60 - 1242.00] really sick
[1240.48 - 1244.48] though right and really struggling
[1242.00 - 1246.48] that's when you know mice are men
[1244.48 - 1248.24] that's when you know make or break
[1246.48 - 1249.60] that's when you know do or die
[1248.24 - 1251.12] that's when you know is it right or
[1249.60 - 1251.92] wrong that's when you know it's going to
[1251.12 - 1254.72] work or not
[1251.92 - 1256.56] that's when you're going to go good or
[1254.72 - 1259.04] not right which just that's when
[1256.56 - 1260.32] it's going to be the deal breaker the
[1259.04 - 1264.24] deal breaker right
[1260.32 - 1264.24] you can go around not that sick
[1264.32 - 1268.96] i got this gluten-free bread i could do
[1267.52 - 1271.28] the coconut ice cream

[1272.08 - 1275.68] yep that's right okay i can just go
[1274.64 - 1277.20] through life

[1366.64 - 1372.64] sick okay and
[1368.64 - 1372.64] but when they're not so sick start going
[1372.80 - 1376.16] over time whether it's five years later
[1374.64 - 1377.76] two years later whatever it is
[1376.16 - 1380.16] or they're not they're moving out of
[1377.76 - 1382.32] their 20s
[1380.16 - 1384.64] they're not 21 anymore they're not 23
[1382.32 - 1386.16] anymore they're not 25 anymore not 27
[1384.64 - 1387.84] anymore whatever it is moving into the
[1386.16 - 1388.88] 30s or they're not 35 anymore and
[1387.84 - 1390.08] they're moving and
[1388.88 - 1392.40] and then they're getting sicker it could
[1390.08 - 1395.92] be any age this happens
[1392.40 - 1398.40] and that's when yo
[1395.92 - 1399.20] it's make or break all these things
[1398.40 - 1401.84] count
[1399.20 - 1402.32] every last bit of it all these little
[1401.84 - 1405.92] things
[1402.32 - 1409.12] matter you're traveling and your luggage
[1405.92 - 1410.88] goes through that radiation right
[1409.12 - 1413.28] that luggage luggage goes through the
[1410.88 - 1418.96] radiation and you're traveling
[1413.28 - 1418.96] right you know what i love about live
[1420.56 - 1424.16] you know what i love about doing it live
[1424.88 - 1428.32] you can actually not put enough water in
[1426.64 - 1431.52] a pan because you're too busy
[1428.32 - 1433.20] too busy teaching and you lose you lose
[1431.52 - 1435.20] your asparagus are actually done so i
[1433.20 - 1437.36] got to take them out
[1435.20 - 1439.36] but anyway the point is is when when
[1437.36 - 1441.76] we're in that position
[1439.36 - 1443.36] right where every little bit counts
[1441.76 - 1444.40] you've got your luggage glowing in the
[1443.36 - 1445.76] dark because it's going through the
[1444.40 - 1447.76] radiation machine
[1445.76 - 1449.36] okay and you're getting all that
[1447.76 - 1450.64] radiation because your luggage is so
[1449.36 - 1451.92] filled with it because i talk about how
[1450.64 - 1452.40] you got to throw out your luggage over
[1451.92 - 1453.84] time
[1452.40 - 1455.36] i talk about that i'm going to actually
[1453.84 - 1456.48] take asparagus out and get it ready
[1455.36 - 1457.52] because i got to cook some other stuff
[1456.48 - 1460.64] for you right now
[1457.52 - 1464.08] um and but the bottom line is
[1460.64 - 1466.00] all these things matter and
[1464.08 - 1469.60] you guys i love having you in my kitchen
[1466.00 - 1470.88] i got to be honest it's the best okay
[1469.60 - 1473.28] it's the best to have you guys in the
[1470.88 - 1474.72] kitchen
[1473.28 - 1476.56] these are actually really done they
[1474.72 - 1478.24] cooked really quick
[1476.56 - 1479.76] do you ever guys guys ever find
[1478.24 - 1482.64] asparagus that are
[1479.76 - 1483.76] um you ever find the asparagus that are
[1482.64 - 1487.04] big like this
[1483.76 - 1489.20] these are new asparagus they're not the
[1487.04 - 1490.96] old asparagus canes you know i'm sure
[1489.20 - 1491.28] you guys know your asparagus by now
[1490.96 - 1492.80] right
[1491.28 - 1494.56] many of you probably already have known
[1492.80 - 1496.48] it all your life but
[1494.56 - 1498.96] these are the young asparagus right here
[1496.48 - 1500.72] the thick ones the thick juicy ones
[1498.96 - 1502.08] they're so good for you but listen
[1500.72 - 1503.68] here's the other thing doesn't mean
[1502.08 - 1506.80] don't do your asparagus right
[1503.68 - 1509.36] understand this part right here is that
[1506.80 - 1511.44] is that you can do the skinny asparagus
[1509.36 - 1513.52] which is an older asparagus meaning the
[1511.44 - 1514.56] canes are older the asparagus is older
[1513.52 - 1517.84] right
[1514.56 - 1519.76] and it's medicinal too there's two forms
[1517.84 - 1521.92] of like medicinal when it comes to
[1519.76 - 1522.24] asparagus two levels of medicinal
[1521.92 - 1523.68] there's
[1522.24 - 1525.84] level there's a level of medicinal with
[1523.68 - 1526.32] the young asparagus which is juicy like
[1525.84 - 1529.20] this
[1526.32 - 1530.24] okay there's a level with that and then
[1529.20 - 1533.44] there's a level with
[1530.24 - 1538.00] um and there's a level with
[1533.44 - 1540.48] uh the older asparagus which is like
[1538.00 - 1541.04] really spindly thin have you guys ever
[1540.48 - 1543.84] seen that
[1541.04 - 1543.84] it's really thin
[1552.72 - 1555.92] so what i'm going to do is chop up a
[1554.72 - 1557.60] little onion so we're going to play
[1555.92 - 1560.24] onion games as lorraine
[1557.60 - 1560.24] l said
[1561.28 - 1566.24] i think couple people were saying it too
[1562.96 - 1566.24] which actually made me laugh
[1569.04 - 1572.08] someone might think what's medical
[1570.72 - 1575.28] medium talking about right now it
[1572.08 - 1579.20] doesn't sound that interesting
[1575.28 - 1580.88] um but this is this means everything
[1579.20 - 1582.56] when it comes down to healing just so
[1580.88 - 1584.56] you know it means
[1582.56 - 1586.16] so much when it comes down to healing
[1584.56 - 1587.84] i'm gonna be straight out about
[1586.16 - 1599.84] you guys can you hang on for one second
[1587.84 - 1599.84] i just gotta get some onions
[1603.12 - 1605.68] i'm back
[1606.96 - 1611.12] medical medium in the house if you guys
[1609.28 - 1612.08] just came on i was talking about earlier

[1654.80 - 1660.88] healing with amber and um
[1658.48 - 1661.92] i was mind blown on how much knowledge
[1660.88 - 1664.48] they had in general
[1661.92 - 1665.84] i mean because because the knowledge was
[1664.48 - 1667.04] they had just so much experience when

[1689.20 - 1696.80] and onions can kind of when you
[1690.64 - 1700.40] caramelize them they can kind of
[1696.80 - 1700.40] maybe one onion's all i need for this
[1701.76 - 1705.67] that could work good
[1702.61 - 1705.67] [Music]
[1709.68 - 1713.92] so okay so anyway back to the potatoes
[1712.48 - 1715.92] we'll cover that a little bit too

[1722.32 - 1725.52] asparagus the big juicy ones i put it in
[1724.48 - 1726.88] the side of the bowl because what i'm
[1725.52 - 1728.32] doing is i'm making a potato bowl and
[1726.88 - 1730.56] i'm gonna do the asparagus the potato
[1728.32 - 1734.24] and the onions
[1730.56 - 1735.76] it's gonna be a great great bowl of food
[1734.24 - 1738.64] yeah i'm not crying while cutting them
[1735.76 - 1742.00] that's coming elena
[1738.64 - 1743.12] that's already on its way it's already
[1742.00 - 1746.88] on its way
[1743.12 - 1747.52] so tara appleman good to see you
[1746.88 - 1750.48] incredible
[1747.52 - 1751.44] honored you're here um it's an honor to
[1750.48 - 1754.24] have you here
[1751.44 - 1755.44] awesome tara's so awesome um so these
[1754.24 - 1758.08] are pre-steam
[1755.44 - 1760.16] potatoes is what these are so
[1758.08 - 1762.40] pre-steamed potatoes
[1760.16 - 1763.52] and i'm going to chop them up in cubes
[1762.40 - 1764.96] that's what i'm going to do in a little
[1763.52 - 1766.80] bit the onions are already hitting me
[1764.96 - 1769.44] so letting you guys know lorraine you're
[1766.80 - 1772.40] laughing um
[1769.44 - 1774.48] so i like to prep ahead of time on this
[1772.40 - 1776.16] dish so i already have my potato steamed
[1774.48 - 1777.12] i'll make a big bowl of potatoes put it
[1776.16 - 1778.72] in the refrigerator
[1777.12 - 1780.40] let it sit in there and as i was telling
[1778.72 - 1782.56] everybody earlier i don't put a lid on
[1780.40 - 1784.32] it because they get too moist in there
[1782.56 - 1785.52] and they start getting a little moisture
[1784.32 - 1786.48] built inside of it and they get a little
[1785.52 - 1788.40] spongy
[1786.48 - 1789.92] so i don't like that i take the lid off
[1788.40 - 1791.84] so the lid's not there
[1789.92 - 1793.76] and then i keep it in the fridge and i
[1791.84 - 1795.28] let them kind of dry out so if i need
[1793.76 - 1798.00] them in there for a day
[1795.28 - 1799.60] or another day and i need them in there
[1798.00 - 1801.20] i have them there and i could use them
[1799.60 - 1803.36] for all these purposes that's what i
[1801.20 - 1803.36] love
[1807.28 - 1813.92] um so you know uh
[1810.56 - 1814.64] you seem fine to me chris hey talk about
[1813.92 - 1816.56] gout
[1814.64 - 1818.40] gout's the liver that's the liver that's
[1816.56 - 1820.48] when the liver is it
[1818.40 - 1822.40] the liver has said i can't handle
[1820.48 - 1825.44] protein anymore
[1822.40 - 1827.21] or fat the liver's just like i'm done i
[1825.44 - 1829.20] can't handle protein or fat anymore
[1827.21 - 1831.04] [Music]
[1829.20 - 1832.96] and sometimes the liver can get pushed
[1831.04 - 1835.76] over the edge for people
[1832.96 - 1837.52] and then then the liver gets deficient
[1835.76 - 1839.92] like it gets deficiencies
[1837.52 - 1842.08] so your liver is now deficient your
[1839.92 - 1844.08] liver is your vitamin converter
[1842.08 - 1845.12] that's your vitamin and mineral storage
[1844.08 - 1848.16] bin right
[1845.12 - 1849.60] the liver just holds it all chris thanks
[1848.16 - 1851.52] for uh
[1849.60 - 1853.20] because i wanted to talk about gout a
[1851.52 - 1854.24] couple times and i keep on i keep on
[1853.20 - 1858.32] forgetting and i
[1854.24 - 1858.32] i want to talk about gout definitely
[1860.96 - 1867.36] so when it comes down to the liver
[1865.12 - 1868.88] okay if your liver is really
[1867.36 - 1871.44] overburdened
[1868.88 - 1873.44] really overburdened okay and you're
[1871.44 - 1876.64] getting those purines and stuff
[1873.44 - 1879.84] and when the i just want to keep an eye
[1876.64 - 1879.84] on those
[1881.92 - 1884.40] hold on
[1885.52 - 1889.60] i don't want to do what i did to the
[1887.12 - 1891.44] asparagus with the onions this time
[1889.60 - 1892.96] and you know what happens is that when
[1891.44 - 1894.32] people are worried about their diet
[1892.96 - 1895.44] they're worried about purines and
[1894.32 - 1898.08] everything else and
[1895.44 - 1898.80] all that's happening i want to talk
[1898.08 - 1901.28] about that
[1898.80 - 1901.92] what i what i worry about when you have
[1901.28 - 1904.80] gout
[1901.92 - 1906.40] what i worry about is protein and fat
[1904.80 - 1909.04] protein and fat
[1906.40 - 1911.28] that's how it goes wrong with gout
[1909.04 - 1913.20] that's my concern
[1911.28 - 1916.96] and a concern that i've taught doctors
[1913.20 - 1920.16] over time it's a very important concern
[1916.96 - 1923.28] and um gout is something that
[1920.16 - 1924.80] is fixable it can heal it probably one
[1923.28 - 1926.80] of the easiest
[1924.80 - 1928.00] one of the easiest things that can heal
[1926.80 - 1931.04] that that i've seen
[1928.00 - 1934.40] it's like diabetes too you know diet
[1931.04 - 1937.36] type 2 diabetes easy to heal gout
[1934.40 - 1938.48] easy to heal that's when we just have to
[1937.36 - 1940.08] care for the liver
[1938.48 - 1941.20] and you know what happens with gout is
[1940.08 - 1942.80] chris you know what happens a lot of
[1941.20 - 1944.08] people without not everybody so
[1942.80 - 1945.84] you know a lot of people look out
[1944.08 - 1948.24] they'll have uh
[1945.84 - 1949.76] skin problems dermatitis they'll have
[1948.24 - 1950.40] eczema they'll have psoriasis when they
[1949.76 - 1952.32] have gout
[1950.40 - 1953.44] right they have skin issues or their
[1952.32 - 1955.60] skin is just terrible
[1953.44 - 1957.36] their fingernails are terrible their
[1955.60 - 1959.92] toenails are just
[1957.36 - 1961.60] god-awful right like a lot of that
[1959.92 - 1962.00] happens too now you might be somebody
[1961.60 - 1963.92] with with
[1962.00 - 1965.20] gout and you don't have any of that yet
[1963.92 - 1966.48] and you might have a different variety
[1965.20 - 1968.80] of gout where it's not like
[1966.48 - 1970.40] out in your feet it's not gout in your
[1968.80 - 1972.32] toes and ankles
[1970.40 - 1973.52] it's gout somewhere else in the body and
[1972.32 - 1974.80] the doctor's like i don't know what to
[1973.52 - 1976.08] call this thing i'm pretty sure we're
[1974.80 - 1978.16] dealing with gout
[1976.08 - 1979.76] you know smoky mountain paradise good to
[1978.16 - 1982.00] see you
[1979.76 - 1983.44] and so the whole thing with gout is
[1982.00 - 1986.80] about cleaning up the liver my
[1983.44 - 1989.04] number one concern is protein
[1986.80 - 1989.84] and fat those are two things that the
[1989.04 - 1992.24] liver said
[1989.84 - 1993.76] i'm done with i can't handle anymore i
[1992.24 - 1995.20] don't want anything to do with it i
[1993.76 - 1996.40] can't handle the protein can handle the
[1995.20 - 1998.72] fat and that's what the liver does
[1996.40 - 1999.60] then you go deficient people with gout
[1998.72 - 2001.44] they get all these
[1999.60 - 2003.68] mineral deficiencies all these vitamin
[2001.44 - 2006.08] nutrient nutrient deficiencies these
[2003.68 - 2007.44] phytochemical compound deficiencies
[2006.08 - 2009.04] that's what they get
[2007.44 - 2010.80] because their liver is like well i can't
[2009.04 - 2012.24] process the vitamins anymore i can't
[2010.80 - 2014.32] store the vitamins anymore
[2012.24 - 2016.32] there's too much fat in here there's too
[2014.32 - 2019.20] much desiccated protein stuck
[2016.32 - 2020.88] inside the liver everything's gummed up
[2019.20 - 2023.76] that the inner works
[2020.88 - 2024.16] that the waterworks inside your liver
[2023.76 - 2026.48] are
[2024.16 - 2027.20] just done you know the liver is not it's
[2026.48 - 2028.96] not that you're
[2027.20 - 2030.48] in liver failure or anything like that
[2028.96 - 2032.88] that's not at all you can have gout your
[2030.48 - 2033.28] liver seems okay i've seen people with
[2032.88 - 2034.80] gout
[2033.28 - 2036.72] don't even have elevated liver enzymes
[2034.80 - 2040.08] so if their liver is trashed
[2036.72 - 2042.16] because it's not it's not always black
[2040.08 - 2044.00] or white black and white it's not always
[2042.16 - 2046.32] like that it's not always just
[2044.00 - 2048.16] you know it's not it's not two plus two
[2046.32 - 2050.00] equals four when it comes down to that
[2048.16 - 2052.40] so somebody might have
[2050.00 - 2053.68] somebody might have um elevated liver
[2052.40 - 2057.04] enzymes
[2053.68 - 2059.68] with gout someone might not right
[2057.04 - 2060.72] someone might have a bilirubin off the
[2059.68 - 2063.68] chart
[2060.72 - 2064.96] with gout someone might not right so
[2063.68 - 2066.32] these things are really important to
[2064.96 - 2068.16] know but that's that's what i
[2066.32 - 2070.08] always tell people so if you're on a
[2068.16 - 2072.00] vegan plant-based diet
[2070.08 - 2073.44] be careful on how much fat you're eating
[2072.00 - 2074.16] because your gout is going gonna be
[2073.44 - 2076.48] there
[2074.16 - 2077.68] even vegans get gout vegans have gout
[2076.48 - 2080.16] you know it's like
[2077.68 - 2081.44] yeah i know it's amazing how there's a
[2080.16 - 2083.28] whole bunch of vegans and plant-based
[2081.44 - 2085.76] people out there and once they start
[2083.28 - 2088.16] improving with a vegan plant-based diet
[2085.76 - 2089.44] right they're not out of the woods yet
[2088.16 - 2090.88] but they think they're out of the woods
[2089.44 - 2092.16] yet and then they just get sicker later
[2090.88 - 2094.16] because they're doing all these other
[2092.16 - 2095.60] practices they got the fats cranking up
[2094.16 - 2097.20] they're cranking the fats up they got
[2095.60 - 2102.96] other stuff going on and you know they
[2097.20 - 2107.20] just get in trouble
[2102.96 - 2109.12] um sarah hazel i thought keto was the
[2107.20 - 2109.92] healthiest diet until i ended up with
[2109.12 - 2113.84] gout
[2109.92 - 2117.12] yo that's what happens the ketos for men
[2113.84 - 2118.48] that aren't sick what's the ketos for
[2117.12 - 2120.96] keto diet
[2118.48 - 2122.24] the old keto diet used to kill people
[2120.96 - 2125.76] did you guys know that
[2122.24 - 2128.84] did you guys know that the old keto diet
[2125.76 - 2132.32] used to kill women
[2128.84 - 2134.64] yeah uh i'm not exaggerating
[2132.32 - 2135.92] i'm straight up i was telling a doctor
[2134.64 - 2138.16] that the other day and he said you know
[2135.92 - 2140.96] what i remember there was this case
[2138.16 - 2141.28] where there was a woman in his practice
[2140.96 - 2144.72] that
[2141.28 - 2145.84] that that left his practice and it was
[2144.72 - 2147.44] years ago and she just
[2145.84 - 2149.52] did this keto thing and she had no
[2147.44 - 2151.28] glucose gold or system go to her
[2149.52 - 2152.80] neurological system had no glucose her
[2151.28 - 2153.84] brain was missing the glucose and she
[2152.80 - 2156.88] was on a keto
[2153.84 - 2158.48] the old keto diet was you you can't have
[2156.88 - 2161.60] a starchy vegetable
[2158.48 - 2163.12] and you can't have a fruit you can't
[2161.60 - 2164.24] have honey you can't have anything the
[2163.12 - 2167.12] old keto diet now
[2164.24 - 2167.60] when women would adhere that when they
[2167.12 - 2170.40] would
[2167.60 - 2172.00] when they would go by that playbook and
[2170.40 - 2175.44] do it perfectly
[2172.00 - 2179.20] no honey no maple syrup no coconut water
[2175.44 - 2180.80] no uh no avocado
[2179.20 - 2182.96] the old keto diet you weren't allowed to
[2180.80 - 2183.60] do the avocados right avocado has sugar
[2182.96 - 2186.40] in it
[2183.60 - 2187.20] see you know they brought the avocado in
[2186.40 - 2189.60] in the newer
[2187.20 - 2190.88] keto diet you see the old old keto diet
[2189.60 - 2194.08] killed a lot of women
[2190.88 - 2195.76] they died they just died they were sick
[2194.08 - 2197.92] no one knew what was wrong with them and
[2195.76 - 2199.28] they died they lost the glucose to their
[2197.92 - 2202.32] brain and they died and they
[2199.28 - 2205.44] ceased they ceased living okay now
[2202.32 - 2207.04] the new keto diet turned into a non-keto
[2205.44 - 2208.00] diet it's not the keto diet anymore they
[2207.04 - 2211.60] use the same name
[2208.00 - 2214.08] keto but there's sugar in it
[2211.60 - 2215.76] everywhere there's sugar in it
[2214.08 - 2217.12] everywhere is the avocados there's nuts
[2215.76 - 2218.88] and seeds there's nut butters there's
[2217.12 - 2221.04] sugar and all that
[2218.88 - 2223.04] right there's fat in there and then the
[2221.04 - 2224.48] new keto diet's got berries in there so
[2223.04 - 2226.00] what happened was medical medium
[2224.48 - 2229.12] information was
[2226.00 - 2232.24] against the old keto diet
[2229.12 - 2234.80] okay and
[2232.24 - 2236.40] medical medium information has healed
[2234.80 - 2237.84] tens of thousands of people over through
[2236.40 - 2239.04] the years tens of thousands before
[2237.84 - 2241.28] publishing the book
[2239.04 - 2242.08] right the books the first book right it
[2241.28 - 2244.88] changed the
[2242.08 - 2246.32] shape of all the diets out there now
[2244.88 - 2248.00] whether they understand that or not
[2246.32 - 2250.72] whether people know that or not
[2248.00 - 2251.60] the keto diet of the old day i i
[2250.72 - 2254.40] forewarned
[2251.60 - 2254.88] women about because it kill it will kill
[2254.40 - 2257.28] you
[2254.88 - 2258.96] you lose your glucose to your brain and
[2257.28 - 2260.00] if you're sick you could die because of
[2258.96 - 2262.16] that right
[2260.00 - 2264.08] so i'm just caramelizing these onions
[2262.16 - 2265.28] right now which are coming out nice this
[2264.08 - 2268.96] pans really hot
[2265.28 - 2271.28] as we speak um so let me just
[2268.96 - 2272.88] kind of talk a little bit more about
[2271.28 - 2274.88] this this is really an important
[2272.88 - 2276.24] topic it's a part of how things are just
[2274.88 - 2279.60] all screwed up out there
[2276.24 - 2281.76] so now the keto diet see ketosis
[2279.60 - 2283.60] your body would go into ketosis if you
[2281.76 - 2288.96] took sugar away
[2283.60 - 2290.96] right well now the keto diets
[2288.96 - 2292.88] they have sugar in there so you don't go
[2290.96 - 2295.52] into ketosis so why
[2292.88 - 2297.84] is it called the keto diet you you ask
[2295.52 - 2299.76] yourself that
[2297.84 - 2302.00] i ask you to ask yourself that i'll ask
[2299.76 - 2304.80] myself that right now okay
[2302.00 - 2305.20] why do they call it the keto diet when
[2304.80 - 2308.48] you
[2305.20 - 2310.72] can't go into ketosis anymore because
[2308.48 - 2312.96] they have berries in the keto diet
[2310.72 - 2314.08] and they have avocado in the keto diet
[2312.96 - 2317.04] you can't enter
[2314.08 - 2318.40] the ketosis state so why is it called
[2317.04 - 2320.80] the keto diet anymore
[2318.40 - 2324.16] because in alternative medicine there's
[2320.80 - 2324.16] a billion and one screw-ups
[2325.60 - 2329.76] even your simple wholesome keto diet of
[2328.80 - 2332.88] the day
[2329.76 - 2333.76] that's in the magazines that's online is
[2332.88 - 2335.76] screwed up
[2333.76 - 2337.36] and wrong wrong in the sense where they
[2335.76 - 2338.96] don't even understand it
[2337.36 - 2340.80] yeah no i'm on the keto diet i'm doing
[2338.96 - 2342.88] the i'm a i'm a guru i'm a trainer i'm
[2340.80 - 2346.16] on the keto diet
[2342.88 - 2348.24] right but they're on the keto diet
[2346.16 - 2349.68] but they're not on a keto diet you can't
[2348.24 - 2351.20] go into ketosis
[2349.68 - 2352.88] you can't when you eat an avocado can't
[2351.20 - 2356.64] go into ketosis
[2352.88 - 2357.92] you can't you can only go into ketosis
[2356.64 - 2360.96] if you with frame from
[2357.92 - 2362.80] every single starchy vegetable every
[2360.96 - 2364.16] single form of sugar every single
[2362.80 - 2367.28] carbohydrate
[2364.16 - 2369.44] and you just rely on meat alone
[2367.28 - 2371.92] andrea are you are you saying we
[2369.44 - 2373.60] shouldn't have hardly any fat at all
[2371.92 - 2375.44] what do you think about eating avocados
[2373.60 - 2376.80] nuts and seeds olives coconut and olive
[2375.44 - 2377.36] oil those are all healthy fats you just
[2376.80 - 2380.56] mentioned
[2377.36 - 2381.52] andrea all healthy fats depends on how
[2380.56 - 2383.92] sick you are
[2381.52 - 2384.64] right if you're 21 years old you're not
[2383.92 - 2386.32] really sick
[2384.64 - 2388.00] you've got a little acne and you want to
[2386.32 - 2390.08] clean up your diet you want to stop

[2392.00 - 2396.16] like keep the alcohol down
[2393.60 - 2396.72] clean up your diet start to live a life
[2396.16 - 2398.16] where you're like
[2396.72 - 2399.92] you're into health now you want to do a
[2398.16 - 2401.60] little lifestyle channel or something on
[2399.92 - 2402.48] social media and you're 22 years old or
[2401.60 - 2405.04] something
[2402.48 - 2406.40] and you're now doing avocados nuts and
[2405.04 - 2407.92] seeds and nut butters you're doing
[2406.40 - 2409.84] peanut butter smoothies you're doing
[2407.92 - 2411.20] peanut butter acai bowls right
[2409.84 - 2414.16] yeah you can get away with it if you're
[2411.20 - 2415.60] not that sick you get sick man you wanna
[2414.16 - 2416.72] you wanna back down on those fats
[2415.60 - 2418.24] whether you're plant-based or
[2416.72 - 2419.84] animal protein you wanna back down all
[2418.24 - 2421.68] those fats so i'll talk about keto for
[2419.84 - 2423.36] another minute too
[2421.68 - 2424.80] so these are getting caramelized right
[2423.36 - 2427.04] they're coming out really good i'm about
[2424.80 - 2429.28] to put them in a bowl
[2427.04 - 2429.28] so
[2430.56 - 2433.20] all right and then
[2434.88 - 2438.24] but the keto diet today is not the keto
[2436.88 - 2441.04] is not a keto diet
[2438.24 - 2441.68] what it is it's just a clean diet right
[2441.04 - 2444.80] but
[2441.68 - 2446.80] when you're sick even the keto diet of
[2444.80 - 2448.48] today that has taken medical medium
[2446.80 - 2449.84] information and placed it into it which
[2448.48 - 2451.60] are berries
[2449.84 - 2452.96] no one cared about berries it's 35 years
[2451.60 - 2454.08] of medical medium information going all
[2452.96 - 2455.28] the way back when i was trying to teach
[2454.08 - 2456.88] everybody about berries berries berries
[2455.28 - 2459.84] no one cared about berries right
[2456.88 - 2460.96] and and so now that the keto diet has
[2459.84 - 2462.64] berries in there
[2460.96 - 2464.16] you're not and you're you're actually
[2462.64 - 2466.00] being protected a little bit so your
[2464.16 - 2467.04] keto diet can actually get you by but if
[2466.00 - 2470.24] you're a woman
[2467.04 - 2472.24] and you're sick right and you need more
[2470.24 - 2473.84] you'll need more than just your plain
[2472.24 - 2476.24] old clean new
[2473.84 - 2476.88] keto diet keto diets are for men that
[2476.24 - 2478.08] aren't sick
[2476.88 - 2479.44] they want to lose a little weight and
[2478.08 - 2480.96] they want to hop in the gym and start
[2479.44 - 2484.48] working out and then tell women
[2480.96 - 2486.08] tell women how why they're sick
[2484.48 - 2488.08] and then tell women what they're doing
[2486.08 - 2490.32] wrong you need honey you need to be on
[2488.08 - 2491.44] the keynote keto diet like me and get
[2490.32 - 2494.16] into that gym
[2491.44 - 2494.88] the keto diet is for like is is is
[2494.16 - 2498.00] really
[2494.88 - 2500.64] designed for men that aren't sick right
[2498.00 - 2501.84] the keto diet can yeah sure if you're a
[2500.64 - 2503.68] woman and you're not sick and you want
[2501.84 - 2505.04] to do the keto diet and you get into the
[2503.68 - 2506.72] gym and you clean up all the
[2505.04 - 2508.32] donuts cakes and cookies you're going to
[2506.72 - 2510.40] see benefits but if you're
[2508.32 - 2511.68] really struggling with the condition
[2510.40 - 2513.28] whole another bald part
[2511.68 - 2514.88] that's when the keto diet can make you
[2513.28 - 2517.12] sicker and get you in trouble
[2514.88 - 2520.32] and that's what happens okay so i'm just
[2517.12 - 2520.32] putting these onions in here
[2520.72 - 2525.04] like this now i'm going to cut some
[2523.44 - 2529.28] potatoes up
[2525.04 - 2529.28] so i'm going to do that now um
[2529.44 - 2533.28] okay cut some potatoes up
[2534.32 - 2537.84] i'm going to cube these
[2539.04 - 2542.48] if you take somebody that's really sick
[2540.88 - 2543.52] and they got they got neurological
[2542.48 - 2544.64] symptoms
[2543.52 - 2546.08] they don't know why they're sick they've
[2544.64 - 2547.68] been to a bunch of doctors maybe they
[2546.08 - 2549.68] were diagnosed with lyme disease maybe
[2547.68 - 2552.16] they were diagnosed with something else

[2686.08 - 2690.56] above burger king right
[2687.76 - 2691.68] and now you're at another restaurant and
[2690.56 - 2693.84] they're using

[2719.52 - 2723.04] like it's all about the next level the
[2721.20 - 2725.04] next level the next level keto diet is
[2723.04 - 2728.48] just
[2725.04 - 2728.48] is a place you can go but
[2731.36 - 2738.80] it's interesting stuff actually
[2735.12 - 2738.80] so i got some potatoes going on here
[2739.44 - 2742.32] ashley kevin

[2792.24 - 2795.36] these are steamed potatoes came out of
[2793.84 - 2797.28] the fridge today
[2795.36 - 2798.80] so great like how easy is that they're
[2797.28 - 2803.84] already kind of browning a little bit
[2798.80 - 2803.84] this pan is really hot right now
[2807.92 - 2814.64] athena says thrush is a possible cause i
[2811.52 - 2814.64] get that from using
[2814.84 - 2819.12] steroids
[2816.32 - 2819.12] that's interesting
[2820.32 - 2824.40] so um so the point of this look the
[2822.96 - 2825.92] point of this live right now we're live
[2824.40 - 2827.68] on youtube we're live on facebook the
[2825.92 - 2829.28] point of this live is to talk about how
[2827.68 - 2833.04] we can avoid
[2829.28 - 2836.16] getting stunted getting stuck
[2833.04 - 2837.76] getting pushed back and knowing
[2836.16 - 2840.16] information knowing the knowledge is
[2837.76 - 2843.04] really important right there
[2840.16 - 2846.16] angie wynn says what's your opinion on
[2843.04 - 2846.16] b12 injections
[2848.32 - 2854.48] well yeah
[2851.60 - 2856.24] yeah yeah i just got my b12 injection
[2854.48 - 2858.56] uh-huh
[2856.24 - 2859.92] yeah i know i get them once every other
[2858.56 - 2864.56] week
[2859.92 - 2867.68] mm-hmm what they use the bad b12
[2864.56 - 2869.84] you mean you mean not like intravenous
[2867.68 - 2871.04] like iv you mean the injection like they
[2869.84 - 2873.28] stick a needle in your
[2871.04 - 2874.24] arm to just jam you and your arm or your
[2873.28 - 2876.64] butt
[2874.24 - 2878.64] that's the ones i get right yeah they're
[2876.64 - 2882.72] bad
[2878.64 - 2886.88] what why are they bad
[2882.72 - 2889.20] oh your body just your body
[2886.88 - 2889.92] when it comes down to b12 your body
[2889.20 - 2893.52] likes to
[2889.92 - 2897.36] receive it orally so your body
[2893.52 - 2900.56] likes to get oral b12 i see
[2897.36 - 2902.48] so you don't bypass the liver your whole
[2900.56 - 2903.76] process your digestion process your
[2902.48 - 2906.80] liver
[2903.76 - 2910.24] so the b12 has to go
[2906.80 - 2912.64] in your mouth and then find its way
[2910.24 - 2914.80] down to your ilium let me see if i got
[2912.64 - 2919.52] an ilium here
[2914.80 - 2922.64] uh uh-huh
[2919.52 - 2924.16] so your helium down on the right side
[2922.64 - 2925.92] that's where the small intestinal tract
[2924.16 - 2929.36] connects to the
[2925.92 - 2931.68] large intestinal tract that b12 has to
[2929.36 - 2934.40] find its way down there
[2931.68 - 2934.80] because that's where you produce it and
[2934.40 - 2936.56] then
[2934.80 - 2938.48] that gets driven up into the liver and
[2936.56 - 2942.00] then the liver converts it
[2938.48 - 2944.08] ah i see i see so when you
[2942.00 - 2945.04] stick b12 in your bloodstream directly
[2944.08 - 2948.40] in the arm
[2945.04 - 2950.72] like this you're not utilizing it
[2948.40 - 2952.72] and then maybe could even build an
[2950.72 - 2955.84] allergic
[2952.72 - 2957.52] allergy to b12 without the doctor ever
[2955.84 - 2959.20] knowing and then there's an allergy to
[2957.52 - 2960.88] b12 i see
[2959.20 - 2963.12] all right i got to look out for that i
[2960.88 - 2967.84] think what i'll do is just focus on the
[2963.12 - 2967.84] b12 drops in my mouth okay bye
[2968.96 - 2971.84] um
[2972.32 - 2975.44] so what i like to do for friends and
[2974.00 - 2977.60] family
[2975.44 - 2978.88] right these are potatoes are actually
[2977.60 - 2980.08] coming out these are coming out like
[2978.88 - 2984.64] hash browns
[2980.08 - 2987.28] whoa love that like hashbrowns you guys
[2984.64 - 2988.96] so what i like to do with b12 oh here's
[2987.28 - 2991.60] here it is
[2988.96 - 2993.04] um the liquid b12 right here is the
[2991.60 - 2996.24] adenosil cobalamin
[2993.04 - 2998.24] and methylcobalamin and the b12 shots
[2996.24 - 2999.68] unless you got a doctor that's doing ivs
[2998.24 - 3000.48] that's different going directly into the
[2999.68 - 3004.08] vein
[3000.48 - 3005.76] um um cali says i got terrible allergic
[3004.08 - 3007.52] reaction after b12 shots
[3005.76 - 3009.28] i'm not a fan of b12 shots i've seen too
[3007.52 - 3009.60] many people get allergic reactions
[3009.28 - 3012.40] there's
[3009.60 - 3013.36] there's preservatives in b12 shots
[3012.40 - 3015.92] there's
[3013.36 - 3016.64] also the chance that your body could
[3015.92 - 3019.68] build an
[3016.64 - 3021.04] antibody against the b12 because the b12
[3019.68 - 3022.24] is entering without your body's
[3021.04 - 3025.20] permission
[3022.24 - 3026.24] when you enter it in the mouth or in the
[3025.20 - 3028.00] vein itself
[3026.24 - 3029.36] through intravenous either or right
[3028.00 - 3030.24] mouth is the best i've always
[3029.36 - 3032.24] recommended right
[3030.24 - 3034.32] when you enter it in the mouth you're
[3032.24 - 3037.60] you're giving your body's giving you
[3034.32 - 3039.28] permission right when it goes to the
[3037.60 - 3042.80] outside of the body
[3039.28 - 3044.96] and when it's a shot a needle it's going
[3042.80 - 3048.32] against the body's permission
[3044.96 - 3051.36] the body might build an antibody to it
[3048.32 - 3052.64] so that you become sensitive to b12 i've
[3051.36 - 3055.36] seen this over and over again
[3052.64 - 3056.32] i taught about this too for years and i
[3055.36 - 3058.40] still can't believe
[3056.32 - 3060.64] it hasn't gotten out there well if i
[3058.40 - 3062.00] keep on getting censored like i am today
[3060.64 - 3063.84] on facebook and youtube
[3062.00 - 3065.36] it's me it's it's a no wonder why it
[3063.84 - 3068.40] doesn't get out there
[3065.36 - 3069.92] um but anyway the b12
[3068.40 - 3071.44] that's the liquid one the venus of
[3069.92 - 3073.84] cobalamin and methyl
[3071.44 - 3075.44] methylcobalamin combined right the
[3073.84 - 3077.60] combination that's the word the liver
[3075.44 - 3079.36] loves the most
[3077.60 - 3081.04] what i recommend i'm not sponsored by
[3079.36 - 3082.72] these guys but i recommend this one for
[3081.04 - 3083.84] my friends and family that's the vimergy
[3082.72 - 3088.64] v is in victor i
[3083.84 - 3088.64] am as mary ergy dot com vimrgy.com
[3089.28 - 3093.12] what about intravenous vitamin c that's
[3091.44 - 3096.16] in your vein
[3093.12 - 3100.56] sammy sammy loom that's in your vein
[3096.16 - 3102.88] that's not a shot like the b12
[3100.56 - 3104.08] shot right the needle going into the arm
[3102.88 - 3105.28] directly into the muscle in the
[3104.08 - 3107.52] bloodstream
[3105.28 - 3109.68] when it enters into the vein like a lot
[3107.52 - 3112.00] of a lot of practitioners do
[3109.68 - 3113.12] do uh ivc they throw some
[3112.00 - 3116.32] methylcobalamin
[3113.12 - 3118.64] in there they throw uh uh you know
[3116.32 - 3122.16] multivitamin they'll do the injection
[3118.64 - 3124.96] in your vein right that is different
[3122.16 - 3127.76] your body won't build an antibody
[3124.96 - 3127.76] against it
[3128.08 - 3130.72] these are turning into toasty hash
[3129.60 - 3131.52] browns and they're going to go in my
[3130.72 - 3133.36] potato bowl
[3131.52 - 3134.80] how does look i can't wait to eat this
[3133.36 - 3136.40] i'm going to be i'm going to be shoving
[3134.80 - 3139.52] this down right in between this
[3136.40 - 3141.68] now and tick tock
[3139.52 - 3143.20] and then it's the right kind you can get
[3141.68 - 3144.08] intravenous stuff but is it still
[3143.20 - 3145.92] preservatives
[3144.08 - 3147.20] there's intravenous vitamin c that's not
[3145.92 - 3149.60] the good kind of vitamin c
[3147.20 - 3151.44] you have to you have to make sure that's
[3149.60 - 3153.76] not corn derived
[3151.44 - 3155.04] vitamin c intravenously that's something
[3153.76 - 3156.48] to know there
[3155.04 - 3159.04] but getting back to what we were talking
[3156.48 - 3159.84] about earlier 10 steps forward 25 steps
[3159.04 - 3162.00] back
[3159.84 - 3163.76] we got to be careful got to make sure
[3162.00 - 3166.48] your iv
[3163.76 - 3166.96] your ivs through intravenous the vein
[3166.48 - 3168.56] right
[3166.96 - 3169.68] if you're doing nutritional therapies
[3168.56 - 3171.60] through ivs that there's no
[3169.68 - 3173.52] preservatives
[3171.60 - 3175.44] important that one there all on its own
[3173.52 - 3178.48] or the vitamin c is a corn derived
[3175.44 - 3178.48] that's another one too
[3178.84 - 3183.76] okay these are actually done
[3181.52 - 3185.92] they're nice and toasty i am gonna put
[3183.76 - 3189.04] these right here
[3185.92 - 3189.04] see if i can do this right
[3189.36 - 3194.64] um so anyway
[3193.12 - 3196.64] all the all this is important
[3194.64 - 3199.12] information there's so many tidbits
[3196.64 - 3199.76] can i give you a quick rundown you guys
[3199.12 - 3202.48] right
[3199.76 - 3204.24] if i was trying to heal i'd stay away
[3202.48 - 3206.00] from
[3204.24 - 3207.60] apple cider vinegar nutritional yeast
[3206.00 - 3211.68] diatomaceous earth particles
[3207.60 - 3214.48] sodium bicarbonate right just lost one
[3211.68 - 3216.16] i would stay away from bentonite clay
[3214.48 - 3220.48] i'd stay away from clays
[3216.16 - 3223.44] in general okay i would stay away from
[3220.48 - 3224.88] from that i would stay away from zeolite
[3223.44 - 3225.52] i would stay away from alcohol and
[3224.88 - 3226.80] supplements
[3225.52 - 3228.48] preservatives stay away from natural
[3226.80 - 3230.72] flavors stay away from msg stay away
[3228.48 - 3232.96] from milk cheese butter gluten eggs
[3230.72 - 3234.64] i'd stay away from so many things
[3232.96 - 3236.56] because it's critical
[3234.64 - 3237.76] if you want to heal see guys you can do
[3236.56 - 3239.28] a couple things with this what i like to
[3237.76 - 3240.64] do is just throw a little sprinkle a
[3239.28 - 3243.44] little touch of

[3335.68 - 3340.88] uh why not zeolites they dehydrate
[3339.28 - 3342.56] they rob you of electrolytes they're not
[3340.88 - 3345.60] the same zeolites uh
[3342.56 - 3346.96] years before they take electrolytes when
[3345.60 - 3348.72] you're sick and you got neurological
[3346.96 - 3351.44] problems it's the last thing you want
[3348.72 - 3352.96] and um there's a lot of zeolite that's
[3351.44 - 3354.56] pushed into the medical medium community
[3352.96 - 3356.16] now they're saying oh you need to have
[3354.56 - 3357.92] that with your medical medium heavy
[3356.16 - 3360.16] metal detox smoothie no you don't
[3357.92 - 3362.00] no you don't the only reason why zeolite
[3360.16 - 3363.60] never gave anybody any benefits no one
[3362.00 - 3365.20] saw benefits with zeolite all these
[3363.60 - 3366.56] years it's been happening for 20 years
[3365.20 - 3368.56] and no one saw that right
[3366.56 - 3370.24] but the heavy metal detox smoothie
[3368.56 - 3371.44] macromedia heavy metal detox movie gave
[3370.24 - 3373.20] people benefits so what
[3371.44 - 3375.20] they do is they try to say well take
[3373.20 - 3376.80] that with your take it too with your
[3375.20 - 3378.32] heavy metal detox smoothie and as people
[3376.80 - 3379.76] get benefits from the heavy metal detox
[3378.32 - 3380.08] smoothie they think it's a zeolite
[3379.76 - 3382.56] because

[3382.56 - 3385.12] marketing and
[3383.36 - 3386.64] pyramid schemers working on it now and
[3385.12 - 3387.68] be like no it's your zeolite that did it
[3386.64 - 3389.76] and they're all like there's just
[3387.68 - 3391.12] everybody's trying to sell a zealot
[3389.76 - 3392.48] i'm not saying that the people are bad

[3395.92 - 3399.44] other stuff and
[3397.28 - 3401.44] i'm just saying that it's not the first

[3401.44 - 3405.60] mean bandwagon and try to push stuff
[3403.84 - 3407.04] that medical medium doesn't recommend
