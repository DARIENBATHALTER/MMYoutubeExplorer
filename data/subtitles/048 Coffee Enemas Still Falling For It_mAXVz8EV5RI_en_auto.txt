[52.52 - 57.68] whole lot of people doing a whole lot of
[55.12 - 60.76] bad to themselves but I don't blame them
[57.68 - 62.96] one bit it's easy to fall in into an old
[60.76 - 66.00] trendy trap that becomes a new trendy
[62.96 - 69.08] trap all over again but this one sneaks
[66.00 - 72.16] up the back door and chips away at your

[101.00 - 106.00] the coffee in for like 3 minutes but it
[103.00 - 108.48] can get really uncomfortable and that's
[106.00 - 112.12] okay because you can put on something
[108.48 - 114.28] relaxing like a podcast or something or
[112.12 - 115.80] a meditation while we're doing this
[114.28 - 119.52] whatever works for you like whatever
[115.80 - 121.60] your truth is just do it anyway this is
[119.52 - 125.40] going to be help ful for detoxification
[121.60 - 127.52] of blood and the liver and bile and I'm
[125.40 - 130.72] energetic after I do it and I feel
[127.52 - 132.12] really good it's like so amazing anyway
[130.72 - 135.04] let's get
[132.12 - 136.04] started coffee Animas are popular
[135.04 - 139.12] they're
[136.04 - 142.76] longstanding theoretically the idea is
[139.12 - 145.28] it cleanses toxins out of the liver
[142.76 - 148.12] that's a great idea we want toxins out
[145.28 - 151.56] of the liver we want our liver cleansed
[148.12 - 155.16] and healthier why not so that's why
[151.56 - 157.92] coffee enemas really sound good and then
[155.16 - 161.56] if we get sick chronically sick we hear
[157.92 - 164.72] about coffee animus being a Panacea like
[161.56 - 168.24] an alltime fixer upper if we have a
[164.72 - 170.44] problem a disease any kind of condition
[168.24 - 173.08] if we're suffering in any way we're
[170.44 - 176.08] going to hear from somebody somewhere
[173.08 - 178.84] whether on social or online or at a
[176.08 - 181.76] clinic do a coffee enema it will help
[178.84 - 185.12] you it may even save you and coffee
[181.76 - 187.36] enemas used to be just involved in
[185.12 - 189.72] alternative medicine so it was an
[187.36 - 192.32] alternative medicine thing it was never
[189.72 - 195.56] conventional medicine but now it has
[192.32 - 198.80] crossed over into conventional medicine
[195.56 - 201.80] so both fields of medicine say coffee
[198.80 - 206.24] enemas they're good for you and they all
[201.80 - 209.44] are parting the same claim a perfectly
[206.24 - 210.60] good reasonable claim detoxifying the
[209.44 - 214.60] liver
[210.60 - 217.24] does help you heal but there's a problem
[214.60 - 221.04] the first problem here's where we get
[217.24 - 225.48] into trouble coffee to begin with is
[221.04 - 229.36] strong very strong but not in a good way
[225.48 - 231.68] coffee is also harsh very harsh not in a
[229.36 - 233.68] good way extremely
[231.68 - 236.52] acidic
[233.68 - 238.72] dehydrating highly
[236.52 - 241.76] astringent and
[238.72 - 246.00] overstimulating because coffee is a drug
[241.76 - 248.52] and people love their drug people love
[246.00 - 250.72] their drugs and coffee is one of those
[248.52 - 253.56] addictive drugs that people don't want
[250.72 - 256.32] to let go it's hard for them to let go
[253.56 - 258.60] it's a massive industry and people love
[256.32 - 262.00] their coffee and that's why the coffee
[258.60 - 264.44] enema sounds so good there are two kinds
[262.00 - 268.68] of people in the world one kind of
[264.44 - 271.44] person will get an Ena any kind of Ena a
[268.68 - 273.92] water enema some kind of Solution that's
[271.44 - 275.92] pharmaceutical grade and then there's
[273.92 - 280.60] the other kind of person in the world
[275.92 - 283.40] that will never ever ever get an enema
[280.60 - 286.24] even if they're on their dying breath in
[283.40 - 287.40] a hospital bed somewhere and this is the
[286.24 - 290.64] last time they're going to be here on
[287.40 - 293.84] this planet they will never get an enema
[290.64 - 298.12] but because everybody drinks coffee and
[293.84 - 300.28] loves coffee so much that a bridge gets
[298.12 - 302.76] put in between the two kinds of people
[300.28 - 304.40] in the world and even some of the most
[302.76 - 307.44] stubborn people that would never get an
[304.40 - 310.12] enema will consider an enema only
[307.44 - 312.00] because it's a coffee enema it's the
[310.12 - 314.92] only way they'll ever even consider it
[312.00 - 317.76] they may still not do it but there are
[314.92 - 319.16] some people that break and they break
[317.76 - 322.60] because they think about it and they're
[319.16 - 324.20] like coffee I like coffee okay doctor or
[322.60 - 327.80] practitioner or health coach I'm going
[324.20 - 330.80] to do it now remember coffee is really
[327.80 - 334.44] acidic extremely
[330.80 - 337.96] astringent very harsh so what happens
[334.44 - 342.40] when we drink coffee we have a buffer
[337.96 - 346.32] our stomach is that poison control
[342.40 - 349.08] Shield it buffers things that aren't
[346.32 - 352.52] good for us it buffers things that are
[349.08 - 356.60] really really harsh so our stomachs are
[352.52 - 360.32] designed to actually try to withhold
[356.60 - 364.16] poison as long as possible in Hope hopes
[360.32 - 368.84] that we vomit the poison up or that we
[364.16 - 371.08] get a chance to exit the poison up the
[368.84 - 375.04] esophagus out of our mouth and out of
[371.08 - 377.80] our body so our stomach is a buffer zone
[375.04 - 380.72] it holds on to things not just for
[377.80 - 383.36] digestion not just for
[380.72 - 386.20] stimulation not just for enzymes to
[383.36 - 389.96] start breaking things down our stomach
[386.20 - 393.44] purposely holds things in there just
[389.96 - 396.52] long enough in case something is toxic
[393.44 - 400.60] or poisonous in case we ingested
[396.52 - 402.80] something that's extremely bad for us
[400.60 - 405.84] this doesn't mean coffee makes you
[402.80 - 409.16] vomit that's not what this is it may
[405.84 - 410.80] make somebody vomit out there I'm sure
[409.16 - 413.56] somebody doesn't like coffee or they're
[410.80 - 416.40] sensitive to it and they vomit it out if
[413.56 - 420.12] they drink it but it's not meant to
[416.40 - 424.20] happen that way but it nevertheless
[420.12 - 426.40] it's a harsh toxic poison that sits
[424.20 - 429.28] inside the stomach and the stomach
[426.40 - 432.52] buffers it it buffers the
[429.28 - 434.48] acidity which is extremely harsh it
[432.52 - 438.20] buffers the
[434.48 - 441.48] stringency and it buffers the caffeine
[438.20 - 443.88] most importantly the caffeine our
[441.48 - 446.48] stomachs hold on to the caffeine so when
[443.88 - 448.84] we drink a cup of coffee our stomach is
[446.48 - 452.28] holding on to the coffee as long as it
[448.84 - 455.36] can because it's holding on to the
[452.28 - 458.92] caffeine it identifies the caffeine
[455.36 - 461.08] hangs on to it so it disperses in small
[458.92 - 463.76] amounts into the
[461.08 - 466.32] bloodstream it's holding the caffeine
[463.76 - 468.64] back as much as possible and as long as
[466.32 - 471.84] possible so only
[468.64 - 475.24] increments of the caffeine enter into
[471.84 - 477.80] the bloodstream not all at once because
[475.24 - 481.48] when it enters all at once into the
[477.80 - 485.00] bloodstream it attacks the heart our
[481.48 - 488.48] stomachs have a two-step identification
[485.00 - 491.08] process One Step the stomach knows
[488.48 - 494.48] what's entering into it the tissue
[491.08 - 498.88] itself is experiencing it and absorbing
[494.48 - 501.84] it second step a signal from the brain
[498.88 - 505.56] matches the stomach's understanding they
[501.84 - 508.28] both connect the brain the nervous
[505.56 - 510.84] system sends a signal telling the
[508.28 - 515.04] stomach to hold on to that caffeine as
[510.84 - 517.80] long as possible the stomach agrees
[515.04 - 520.84] communicates with the brain and holds on
[517.80 - 523.40] to the caffeine as long as possible and
[520.84 - 525.88] one of the most important reasons this
[523.40 - 528.16] communication happens to hold on to that
[525.88 - 530.64] poison that caffeine as long as possible
[528.16 - 534.32] inside the stomach is because if it was
[530.64 - 537.40] released all at once there would be an
[534.32 - 540.52] emergency the emergency would be
[537.40 - 544.96] adrenaline being released on a large
[540.52 - 548.76] scale a large release of adrenaline so
[544.96 - 552.88] large it can injure and damage the brain
[548.76 - 554.92] heart and liver and then there's the
[552.88 - 558.72] communication between adrenals and the
[554.92 - 562.28] stomach they have a lot in common they
[558.72 - 564.24] protect each other adrenals protect the
[562.28 - 566.92] stomach the stomach protects the
[564.24 - 570.24] adrenals there's a reason for that too
[566.92 - 573.08] much adrenaline released too many times
[570.24 - 575.28] like adrenaline addiction which people
[573.08 - 578.60] actually suffer from all the time in
[575.28 - 582.20] different ways too much adrenaline
[578.60 - 584.16] release damages the nerves in the lining
[582.20 - 586.88] of the stomach and guess where those
[584.16 - 590.08] nerves come from they come from the
[586.88 - 593.68] Vegas nerves and when these nerves get
[590.08 - 598.20] hypers sensitive from being adrenaline
[593.68 - 600.40] injured then the person gets nauseous
[598.20 - 604.20] and hypers sensitive
[600.40 - 606.60] and can start to feel their food feel it
[604.20 - 609.76] so much they get confused thinking
[606.60 - 611.76] they're not digesting their food anymore
[609.76 - 615.60] so they start saying things like well I
[611.76 - 619.00] can't eat lettuce and kale and cilantro
[615.60 - 622.12] and parsley I can't eat zucchinis I
[619.00 - 625.96] can't eat raw broccoli I can't eat
[622.12 - 628.72] cucumbers and tomatoes it's too harsh it
[625.96 - 630.00] feels like it's bothering my stomach and
[628.72 - 632.88] it's not
[630.00 - 635.44] digesting what people don't realize the
[632.88 - 638.08] food's digesting but it doesn't feel
[635.44 - 641.16] like it's digesting because the nerves
[638.08 - 645.24] have been irritated and injured the
[641.16 - 649.60] nerves that align the stomach make no
[645.24 - 650.68] mistake coffee has caffeine caffeine
[649.60 - 652.84] ignites
[650.68 - 655.36] adrenaline everybody's high on
[652.84 - 657.64] adrenaline they're high in their coffee
[655.36 - 661.04] they're high in their caffeine and that
[657.64 - 665.32] caffeine enters the organs enters the
[661.04 - 669.68] brain the kidneys the liver the spleen
[665.32 - 671.96] the pancreas and the stomach and that
[669.68 - 674.28] stomach has all those nerves and the
[671.96 - 677.12] caffeine over time irritates those
[674.28 - 680.00] nerves but the stomach holds on to the
[677.12 - 682.68] caffeine as long as it can with the
[680.00 - 686.48] communication it has with the brain to
[682.68 - 690.00] stop an adrenaline release a
[686.48 - 692.84] superpowered surge of adrenaline so the
[690.00 - 695.68] stomach releases little spurts of
[692.84 - 698.44] caffeine into the bloodstream which
[695.68 - 701.00] ignites the adrenaline to only rise so
[698.44 - 703.12] much and that's the high everybody runs
[701.00 - 705.16] on all day long especially if they're
[703.12 - 707.32] intermittent fasting or they're not
[705.16 - 709.64] eating much and they're on coffee all
[707.32 - 711.88] day and they're doing their errands and
[709.64 - 713.48] their appointments and they're high on
[711.88 - 716.52] little spurts of
[713.48 - 719.76] adrenaline and that adrenaline even on
[716.52 - 722.60] low low Amounts is still
[719.76 - 724.24] hyper irritating to the nerves along
[722.60 - 727.40] with the caffeine being irritating to
[724.24 - 730.12] the nerves as well it's a double whammy
[727.40 - 731.28] so many people are worried about aging
[730.12 - 734.56] they're trying to do the whole
[731.28 - 737.56] anti-aging thing and Longevity but
[734.56 - 741.84] caffeine is the ultimate
[737.56 - 744.16] Ager and everybody's on it almost
[741.84 - 746.68] everybody they're living off of it many
[744.16 - 749.20] of them women who are worried about
[746.68 - 751.80] their skin and are worried about getting
[749.20 - 755.00] older and worried about their looks and
[751.80 - 757.84] how and their appearance are consuming
[755.00 - 760.72] caffeine on a rate and on a scale it's
[757.84 - 762.96] unimaginable at this point in history
[760.72 - 765.12] and a lot of women nowadays are worried
[762.96 - 767.16] about what they eat how they take care
[765.12 - 769.92] of themselves what they're doing for
[767.16 - 772.40] themselves their exercise routines and
[769.92 - 775.80] the Spas they go to to get lymphatic
[772.40 - 778.12] drainage and the saas and everything
[775.80 - 779.72] else they're doing so what they're
[778.12 - 782.76] essentially doing is
[779.72 - 784.32] battling the bad that they're doing
[782.76 - 787.64] they're hooked on the
[784.32 - 790.08] caffeine and then they're trying to
[787.64 - 791.96] counter it without realizing it with all
[790.08 - 794.48] these other things they're doing so it's
[791.96 - 795.88] a constant War it's like doing some
[794.48 - 799.16] things that could be
[795.88 - 802.08] helpful to support the thing that isn't
[799.16 - 804.68] helpful while not even realizing this is
[802.08 - 807.12] happening they need their coffee they
[804.68 - 809.44] need their caffeine to function to do
[807.12 - 813.36] their appointments to do anything at all
[809.44 - 815.48] all day long and the coffe is aging them
[813.36 - 817.60] the caffeine's Aging them and at the
[815.48 - 819.44] same time they're using the caffine to
[817.60 - 821.88] give them strength and energy and
[819.44 - 824.68] fortitude to go and do all their Marriot
[821.88 - 828.32] of appointments all day long that are
[824.68 - 832.48] anti-aging and then there's the men the
[828.32 - 834.52] new man not the old man in the past that
[832.48 - 837.68] drank coffee in the morning during his
[834.52 - 841.72] break time maybe one more at the end of
[837.68 - 845.36] the day no talking about men that are in
[841.72 - 847.88] the saas at the Spas every day doing
[845.36 - 850.64] their exercise routines sitting there on
[847.88 - 852.92] social all day long and they're hooked
[850.64 - 855.96] on caffeine too and the caffeine is
[852.92 - 858.72] giving them energy and giving them
[855.96 - 860.84] fortitude to push through their day and
[858.72 - 862.84] get all their appointments done they're
[860.84 - 864.36] doing things that are aging them like
[862.84 - 867.20] the coffee and the caffeine and the
[864.36 - 868.44] energy drinks and that same time they're
[867.20 - 870.16] trying to do other things that are
[868.44 - 873.28] anti-aging
[870.16 - 875.56] when coffee enters our stomach it
[873.28 - 878.88] challenges our pH
[875.56 - 881.04] environment it challenges our stomach's
[878.88 - 884.84] environment our gastric
[881.04 - 888.84] glands our gastric juices our
[884.84 - 892.60] HCL but our stomachs can handle many
[888.84 - 896.40] times strong Brew they can handle it
[892.60 - 898.76] enough it hinders our stomachs it lowers
[896.40 - 901.76] our HCL over time which breaks down
[898.76 - 905.28] protein protein it destroys our gastric
[901.76 - 907.80] glands throughout the years but
[905.28 - 911.72] nevertheless our stomach is still
[907.80 - 914.40] designed to handle a punch and to handle
[911.72 - 917.24] that strong brew and then there's a
[914.40 - 919.32] group of people who are
[917.24 - 921.32] sensitive they've been sensitive their
[919.32 - 923.96] whole lives or at least a part of their
[921.32 - 927.60] life they have a pancreas issue
[923.96 - 932.20] gallbladder problems weak stomachs maybe
[927.60 - 935.00] Crohn's k or IBS maybe some kind of
[932.20 - 938.28] digestive compromise or
[935.00 - 942.12] distress maybe they have neurological
[938.28 - 945.56] symptoms anxiety Tremors tingles
[942.12 - 948.36] numbness brain fog aches and pains and
[945.56 - 951.20] maybe even struggling with insomnia and
[948.36 - 954.52] they know coffee doesn't sit right with
[951.20 - 957.60] them and that leads us to another two
[954.52 - 959.68] kinds of people in the world one doesn't
[957.60 - 961.72] have a lot of neurological problems
[959.68 - 964.48] neurological symptoms they're not
[961.72 - 967.08] struggling with chronic illness they got
[964.48 - 970.40] in the moment a stomach of
[967.08 - 973.08] Steel and they can do fine with coffee
[970.40 - 976.12] they can drink it all day long and every
[973.08 - 978.36] day and then the other kind of person in
[976.12 - 980.88] the world the chronically sick the
[978.36 - 983.08] chronically ill somebody who's hypers
[980.88 - 985.40] sensitive their nervous system is
[983.08 - 988.40] challenged their immune systems are
[985.40 - 991.88] challenged they're struggling they may
[988.40 - 995.64] even be suffering and both these types
[991.88 - 998.88] of people in the world get told to do a
[995.64 - 1001.36] coffee enema and that takes us to the
[998.88 - 1003.28] coffee enem itself because if you're
[1001.36 - 1005.84] somebody who's chronically sick and you
[1003.28 - 1006.96] have neurological symptoms and you get a
[1005.84 - 1012.28] coffee
[1006.96 - 1016.08] enema the damage the injuries the harm
[1012.28 - 1018.32] could be much more serious than if
[1016.08 - 1020.84] you're somebody that hey stomach of
[1018.32 - 1023.44] Steel no neurological symptoms in the
[1020.84 - 1026.00] moment in their life and they're getting
[1023.44 - 1028.76] a coffee enema and there's a big
[1026.00 - 1032.84] difference it's hurting them but they
[1028.76 - 1035.40] can handle it better and then what about
[1032.84 - 1038.44] dosages what kind of Eno are we talking
[1035.40 - 1040.08] about what is the dosage because what
[1038.44 - 1045.56] happens out there is you can take a
[1040.08 - 1048.40] woman who's 5et tall 99 lb and they'll
[1045.56 - 1053.88] stick the same amount of coffee in that
[1048.40 - 1059.08] woman is a would a man that's
[1053.88 - 1061.00] 6'4 220 lb and is the woman sick with
[1059.08 - 1063.84] chronic illness and neurological
[1061.00 - 1065.56] problems versus the man who may not have
[1063.84 - 1068.12] any neurological problems in the moment
[1065.56 - 1071.16] at all and the same amount of coffee is
[1068.12 - 1073.72] going into both of them once again
[1071.16 - 1075.88] another huge flaw now there's a big
[1073.72 - 1078.52] difference from drinking coffee to doing
[1075.88 - 1081.76] a coffee enema when anything goes in the
[1078.52 - 1084.12] stomach regardless if it's a can of soda
[1081.76 - 1086.48] if it's something else if it's a food if
[1084.12 - 1089.64] it's a glass of milk if it's a parasite
[1086.48 - 1092.28] you picked up at a restaurant eating out
[1089.64 - 1095.68] regardless of what it is the stomach is
[1092.28 - 1099.12] built to deal with it but if it goes up
[1095.68 - 1101.24] the rectum if it goes into the anus if
[1099.12 - 1105.12] it goes up into the colon and it's
[1101.24 - 1107.28] forced up there it's a different story
[1105.12 - 1109.44] the stomach doesn't apply anymore the
[1107.28 - 1113.36] stomach's ability to buffer to delegate
[1109.44 - 1116.16] to protect to withhold all gone all of
[1113.36 - 1118.88] it out the window it's an entirely
[1116.16 - 1121.20] different thing we're talking about now
[1118.88 - 1122.80] the hydrochloric acid in your colon is
[1121.20 - 1124.76] much different than when it was when it
[1122.80 - 1127.60] started in your stomach produced by your
[1124.76 - 1130.64] stomach glands it was fired up it was
[1127.60 - 1134.08] strong it had strength to it by the time
[1130.64 - 1137.20] it gets to the colon and almost out of
[1134.08 - 1140.04] the rectum that hydrochloric acid is
[1137.20 - 1142.64] nothing to what it used used to be it
[1140.04 - 1144.88] has no protective measures anymore it
[1142.64 - 1148.16] has no ability to digest or break down
[1144.88 - 1150.60] anything or pull apart anything it's
[1148.16 - 1153.80] useless it just becomes part of your
[1150.60 - 1156.84] elimination now so let's talk about what
[1153.80 - 1159.56] happens when you insert coffee up your
[1156.84 - 1162.96] anus so I just got back from the
[1159.56 - 1169.44] drugstore let's see it says open up
[1162.96 - 1173.08] here let's see undo wrapper pull tab um
[1169.44 - 1176.40] connect it says unscrew unscrew I'm
[1173.08 - 1178.96] going to unscrew this top
[1176.40 - 1181.92] here then directions did you prepare
[1178.96 - 1184.84] your coffee I have to figure this out I
[1181.92 - 1187.28] do have my coffee here let me
[1184.84 - 1189.64] see all right and I think I could fill
[1187.28 - 1191.76] this up but I I can't do this without
[1189.64 - 1195.64] some music I need a little music to
[1191.76 - 1195.64] relax me a little bit let me
[1195.76 - 1205.16] see all right all right
[1200.04 - 1208.20] so take this pipe and um insert it it
[1205.16 - 1211.60] says insert it into your
[1208.20 - 1215.24] rectum okay all
[1211.60 - 1219.76] right ooh ooh
[1215.24 - 1224.08] ooh oh yeah all
[1219.76 - 1227.64] right okay squeeze the
[1224.08 - 1231.20] bag all right squeezing the
[1227.64 - 1235.04] bag I'm trying
[1231.20 - 1239.08] to oh ow I'm on the floor right now I
[1235.04 - 1242.16] think I need some help um I just spilled
[1239.08 - 1246.52] it everywhere on the floor and it came
[1242.16 - 1249.04] out I think I have to reinsert it oh God
[1246.52 - 1251.16] it's getting everywhere I have to get
[1249.04 - 1254.68] some
[1251.16 - 1256.64] towels our liver's protective buddy and
[1254.68 - 1260.28] friend is its
[1256.64 - 1262.68] stomach the stomach the liver's stomach
[1260.28 - 1265.08] our stomach the body's stomach it is the
[1262.68 - 1267.68] liver's best friend it buffers
[1265.08 - 1271.00] everything and when it's not there and
[1267.68 - 1272.20] it doesn't have the livers back and
[1271.00 - 1275.76] something
[1272.20 - 1278.88] enters up through the rectum into the
[1275.76 - 1281.88] colon and into the bloodstream from
[1278.88 - 1284.60] behind not in our mouth but from
[1281.88 - 1286.60] underneath us behind it's an entirely
[1284.60 - 1290.24] different story and our liver is not
[1286.60 - 1293.04] protected anymore and our liver is very
[1290.24 - 1297.24] vulnerable our livers are never meant to
[1293.04 - 1303.56] take a direct hit a direct attack or a
[1297.24 - 1306.92] direct punch it never gets a direct
[1303.56 - 1309.96] slam everything that hits the liver has
[1306.92 - 1311.16] always been buffered including alcohol
[1309.96 - 1313.28] when somebody drinks a whole bunch of
[1311.16 - 1316.68] alcohol which is going to affect the
[1313.28 - 1319.68] liver in a bad way that alcohol sits in
[1316.68 - 1322.48] the stomach and gets buffed Ed by the
[1319.68 - 1325.44] stomach and time relased into the
[1322.48 - 1329.40] bloodstream so the liver doesn't get the
[1325.44 - 1333.32] first punch and our colon is not a
[1329.40 - 1337.80] buffer it's not our stomach it has
[1333.32 - 1341.12] nothing to do with our stomach as far as
[1337.80 - 1344.56] how the layout works with the tissue the
[1341.12 - 1347.64] thickness the design the cell
[1344.56 - 1352.08] structures all of it is different the
[1347.64 - 1357.04] colon is not a buffer for the liver on
[1352.08 - 1360.36] any level the colon instead is a direct
[1357.04 - 1361.96] passageway to the liver and that might
[1360.36 - 1366.24] sound like a good thing because we're
[1361.96 - 1370.28] trying to detoxify the liver with the
[1366.24 - 1372.64] coffee but it's not a good thing anytime
[1370.28 - 1375.32] anything enters the rectum and is
[1372.64 - 1377.52] released into the colon it sets off an
[1375.32 - 1379.28] adrenaline release an adrenaline
[1377.52 - 1381.24] response
[1379.28 - 1384.40] but it doesn't mean it's the end of the
[1381.24 - 1387.12] world so if someone takes somebody's
[1384.40 - 1389.92] temperature with a rectum thermometer
[1387.12 - 1391.88] and it enters into the rectum some
[1389.92 - 1394.72] adrenaline is going to be released your
[1391.88 - 1395.92] adrenals are going to respond to
[1394.72 - 1399.52] protection
[1395.92 - 1402.68] method and if someone sticks the hose or
[1399.52 - 1405.28] the pipe to an enema bag into the rectum
[1402.68 - 1407.80] it's going to create an adrenaline
[1405.28 - 1410.60] response and adrenaline is going to be
[1407.80 - 1413.32] released it's not the end of the world
[1410.60 - 1415.72] but it depends on what's being put into
[1413.32 - 1418.60] the rectum into the body and into the
[1415.72 - 1421.56] bloodstream when when it comes down to
[1418.60 - 1423.96] coffee that adrenaline is responding and
[1421.56 - 1427.24] those adrenals are responding to the
[1423.96 - 1430.00] caffeine in the coffee so when caffeine
[1427.24 - 1433.96] goes into the colon through the rectum
[1430.00 - 1436.96] an Urgent Response occurs the emergency
[1433.96 - 1439.04] the button is pressed the adrenals start
[1436.96 - 1441.96] to react instantly
[1439.04 - 1444.68] and the adrenals start to flood large
[1441.96 - 1447.76] amounts of epinephrine large amounts of
[1444.68 - 1450.20] adrenaline into the bloodstream
[1447.76 - 1452.72] immediately and then the person's in
[1450.20 - 1454.56] fight or flight so if the person's
[1452.72 - 1457.48] laying on the bathroom floor and they're
[1454.56 - 1458.92] doing an enema and they're sitting there
[1457.48 - 1460.76] or they're laying there and they're in
[1458.92 - 1463.04] their bathroom they're in fight or
[1460.76 - 1465.88] flight they're in something they're not
[1463.04 - 1468.96] supposed to be in they're in something
[1465.88 - 1471.92] that's reserved for a real problem
[1468.96 - 1475.44] an outside Invader some kind of other
[1471.92 - 1477.84] emergency some kind of bad news it isn't
[1475.44 - 1480.72] supposed to be happening this way but
[1477.84 - 1485.08] yet their whole body is going into fight
[1480.72 - 1489.00] or flight so as they're pumping innocent
[1485.08 - 1492.04] coffee up their anus into their colon
[1489.00 - 1494.80] into their small intestinal tract
[1492.04 - 1497.76] because it can go that far and then all
[1494.80 - 1499.96] that caffeine is surging through and
[1497.76 - 1502.60] pushing through through the colon and
[1499.96 - 1505.24] the small intestinal tract filling the
[1502.60 - 1507.92] bloodstream getting to the brain the
[1505.24 - 1510.56] brain's also reacting communicating with
[1507.92 - 1513.52] the adrenals and now the adrenals are in
[1510.56 - 1517.40] super high gear they're releasing even
[1513.52 - 1519.80] more heavily heavily bombardment of
[1517.40 - 1522.64] adrenaline into the bloodstream because
[1519.80 - 1525.84] this is an urgent situation the body is
[1522.64 - 1528.96] under great threat and then something
[1525.84 - 1532.32] magical happens the person
[1528.96 - 1535.88] starts to feel better because they're
[1532.32 - 1539.24] high the person is feeling the effects
[1535.88 - 1541.88] of an adrenaline High adrenaline is
[1539.24 - 1542.88] pumping through the entire body it can
[1541.88 - 1546.12] be
[1542.88 - 1548.72] euphoric they're feeling something
[1546.12 - 1550.84] they're feeling elevated they're feeling
[1548.72 - 1553.76] energy they're feeling
[1550.84 - 1557.04] strengthened they are jacked
[1553.76 - 1559.92] up and this could be fine for someone
[1557.04 - 1562.24] who is strong who can drink coffee no
[1559.92 - 1565.12] problem they can do a coffee enema and
[1562.24 - 1567.56] not get really sick from it yet and they
[1565.12 - 1570.04] can sit there and feel that Euphoria
[1567.56 - 1571.60] from that adrenaline high but there's
[1570.04 - 1574.36] somebody that actually has a
[1571.60 - 1577.12] neurological symptom or condition or
[1574.36 - 1579.68] problem they're hypers sensitive maybe
[1577.12 - 1581.68] they have Panic issues and anxiety
[1579.68 - 1584.24] issues they're going to be feeling
[1581.68 - 1586.68] something different they're going to be
[1584.24 - 1589.64] high on their adrenaline but their
[1586.68 - 1590.72] nerves are going to start going on fire
[1589.64 - 1592.48] and
[1590.72 - 1596.28] overreacting and then there's the
[1592.48 - 1599.44] coffee's harshness acidic nature a
[1596.28 - 1602.08] stringent nature that's entering the
[1599.44 - 1604.04] bloodstream that's aggravating the colon
[1602.08 - 1607.32] in the small intestinal tract that was
[1604.04 - 1609.00] never buffered ever cuz it's going up
[1607.32 - 1612.88] through the rectum into the
[1609.00 - 1614.08] colon and that toxic coffee is now
[1612.88 - 1617.96] wreaking
[1614.08 - 1620.20] havoc and it's heading to the liver it's
[1617.96 - 1622.40] heading through the bloodstream it
[1620.20 - 1625.96] shouldn't be entering the bloodstream
[1622.40 - 1628.96] without digestion and proper time
[1625.96 - 1631.68] release it wasn't Time released at all
[1628.96 - 1634.00] it was just shot up there pumped up
[1631.68 - 1636.36] there and then it just entered where it
[1634.00 - 1639.72] was going to enter and this is not a
[1636.36 - 1642.00] good thing people would say well it's
[1639.72 - 1644.72] detoxifying it's going to cleanse and
[1642.00 - 1647.68] detoxify my liver but here's the
[1644.72 - 1650.64] interesting thing the liver does not
[1647.68 - 1653.84] like to be forced for
[1650.64 - 1655.64] detoxification the liver detoxifies when
[1653.84 - 1659.44] it wants to detoxify when the
[1655.64 - 1663.32] environment is right not being forced to
[1659.44 - 1666.80] purge liver has an automatic shutdown
[1663.32 - 1669.08] process it's to protect the liver so it
[1666.80 - 1672.96] protects you so if there's a threat of
[1669.08 - 1676.80] any kind the liver shuts down its over
[1672.96 - 1679.00] 2,000 chemical functions goes into low
[1676.80 - 1682.68] battery and
[1679.00 - 1685.12] underdrive goes dormant shuts down and
[1682.68 - 1686.56] it stops doing what it needs to do and
[1685.12 - 1688.68] there's no coffee that's going to
[1686.56 - 1690.96] cleanse it there's no anything that's
[1688.68 - 1694.04] going to cleanse it in that moment the
[1690.96 - 1697.24] opposite happens to what people believe
[1694.04 - 1699.96] happens when they put coffee up the back
[1697.24 - 1702.72] end they think that it's detoxifying the
[1699.96 - 1705.12] liver but the opposite occurs where the
[1702.72 - 1708.76] liver shuts down and becomes more
[1705.12 - 1711.16] toxic the liver becomes abused
[1708.76 - 1714.08] and it's being forced to do something it
[1711.16 - 1716.72] doesn't want to do meanwhile what you
[1714.08 - 1720.28] see on social is all these influencers
[1716.72 - 1723.84] now they're all into self-love and self-
[1720.28 - 1726.00] goodness and positive love and making
[1723.84 - 1728.84] sure they take care of themselves and
[1726.00 - 1731.08] not push things too hard and make sure
[1728.84 - 1733.48] things are balanced and they're all
[1731.08 - 1735.72] going into coffee anemas and they're
[1733.48 - 1738.56] beating the crap out of their own
[1735.72 - 1741.72] livers and it's the direct opposite of
[1738.56 - 1743.32] what they preach and say they do so
[1741.72 - 1745.04] instead of taking care of themselves
[1743.32 - 1746.84] like they preach and say they do out
[1745.04 - 1750.16] there all the time they're looking for
[1746.84 - 1752.56] that quick High the quick fix the trendy
[1750.16 - 1754.68] thing and they're being tricked into
[1752.56 - 1757.60] doing something that's damaging their
[1754.68 - 1760.08] liver hurting their nervous systems
[1757.60 - 1762.84] forcing their liver into
[1760.08 - 1765.32] shutdown thinking that they're forcing
[1762.84 - 1767.48] their liver into
[1765.32 - 1769.92] detoxification they're not caring for
[1767.48 - 1772.68] their body's properly kind of reminds me
[1769.92 - 1775.28] of cold plunging everybody's just doing
[1772.68 - 1777.48] cold plunging without realizing the cold
[1775.28 - 1779.08] plunging can damage the central nervous
[1777.48 - 1781.64] system with somebody who's hypers
[1779.08 - 1784.08] sensitive depending on the temperatures
[1781.64 - 1786.76] and how long and that leads to the next
[1784.08 - 1790.00] thing everybody being a superhero or
[1786.76 - 1792.84] wanting to be a hero or
[1790.00 - 1796.28] superhuman where they'll do the coffee
[1792.84 - 1800.92] enema much longer they'll try to hold in
[1796.28 - 1803.28] the coffee longer or they'll cold plunge
[1800.92 - 1806.04] and they'll cold Plunge in colder water
[1803.28 - 1808.84] much longer and everybody wants to be a
[1806.04 - 1811.68] show off and everybody wants to say hey
[1808.84 - 1813.20] look at me look what I can do and
[1811.68 - 1815.44] they're injuring
[1813.20 - 1817.80] themselves and as they're doing this
[1815.44 - 1820.60] they're trying to sell you enema kits
[1817.80 - 1822.96] enema information coffee enema
[1820.60 - 1825.12] information and courses so they can make
[1822.96 - 1827.60] money off of you or cold plunging
[1825.12 - 1830.92] information and cold plunging equipment
[1827.60 - 1833.24] so you can pay for that too meanwhile
[1830.92 - 1835.64] they're selling an adrenaline High
[1833.24 - 1838.48] they're selling an energy crisis in the
[1835.64 - 1841.48] body they're selling an adrenal crisis a
[1838.48 - 1844.12] brain crisis a heart crisis and a liver
[1841.48 - 1846.92] crisis because What's Happening Here is
[1844.12 - 1850.00] they're selling an adrenaline rush
[1846.92 - 1854.36] because after you do a coffee enema you
[1850.00 - 1857.40] are high three words you are high you're
[1854.36 - 1861.84] high in caffeine and you're high on the
[1857.40 - 1865.36] adrenaline and surge of the body under
[1861.84 - 1870.48] attack because it was dangerous on the
[1865.36 - 1874.68] body and the body saw it as a threat
[1870.48 - 1878.28] unauthorized Rogue toxins coming from
[1874.68 - 1880.32] coffee being forced into the bloodstream
[1878.28 - 1884.80] at an accelerated
[1880.32 - 1887.00] rate unlawfully into the body so once
[1884.80 - 1888.48] you pass being a beginner of coffee
[1887.00 - 1890.36] enimas
[1888.48 - 1893.72] you start going into that let me hold
[1890.36 - 1896.40] the coffee in me longer let me get more
[1893.72 - 1897.92] effects so what influencers will do now
[1896.40 - 1900.52] they're trying to sell the whole coffee
[1897.92 - 1903.24] enema approach they're trying to show
[1900.52 - 1906.20] off and tell their crowds that they tend
[1903.24 - 1909.28] to hold it in longer that they tend to
[1906.20 - 1911.56] squeeze it in kind of squeeze their legs
[1909.28 - 1913.92] and try to keep it inside their colon
[1911.56 - 1916.44] and small intestinal tract try to push
[1913.92 - 1919.52] it as far up as they can to get all the
[1916.44 - 1922.20] detoxification effects possible but what
[1919.52 - 1926.28] they don't realize is they're putting a
[1922.20 - 1929.76] drastic strain on their own Hearts
[1926.28 - 1932.28] they're endangering their own heart
[1929.76 - 1935.20] which could lead to some people having a
[1932.28 - 1938.48] heart attack and dying from coffee
[1935.20 - 1940.96] Animas and this strain on the heart
[1938.48 - 1943.88] causes an adrenaline release that
[1940.96 - 1947.44] surpasses a smaller adrenaline release
[1943.88 - 1949.68] or even a smaller one this is a large
[1947.44 - 1952.48] extreme large adrenaline release the
[1949.68 - 1954.32] longer you hold the coffee in the longer
[1952.48 - 1957.72] that caffeine is going into the
[1954.32 - 1960.40] bloodstream Without A Time release the
[1957.72 - 1963.88] longer the liver is under attack and
[1960.40 - 1966.68] shut down going dormant so it's
[1963.88 - 1969.36] functions aren't even working the longer
[1966.68 - 1972.16] the adrenals are releasing poison which
[1969.36 - 1975.24] is adrenaline cuz it's fight or flight
[1972.16 - 1976.92] the longer the brain has to sit there
[1975.24 - 1978.52] receiving that adrenaline and that
[1976.92 - 1981.28] caffeine
[1978.52 - 1984.32] all of it happening at once while the
[1981.28 - 1985.44] person's holding in the coffee longer
[1984.32 - 1988.44] being a
[1985.44 - 1991.12] showof showing their crowd this is the
[1988.44 - 1994.36] best way to do your coffee enimas
[1991.12 - 1997.88] meanwhile putting their crowd Their
[1994.36 - 2000.92] audience into danger and during this
[1997.88 - 2004.28] process as the liver shut down the
[2000.92 - 2008.64] liver's preparing itself to go into high
[2004.28 - 2011.44] gear to have to accelerate its function
[2008.64 - 2014.24] which means it will not detox at all
[2011.44 - 2017.96] because it has to work because it has to
[2014.24 - 2021.04] collect and absorb and soak up all that
[2017.96 - 2024.32] lethal damaging
[2021.04 - 2027.76] adrenaline that's completely being
[2024.32 - 2030.76] ejected out of the adrenals which by the
[2027.76 - 2033.44] way ages the person faster and faster
[2030.76 - 2036.88] and faster the more coffee enemas the
[2033.44 - 2039.52] quicker somebody ages because they're
[2036.88 - 2041.56] they're deet eting their adrenal
[2039.52 - 2044.88] strength the same adrenal strength women
[2041.56 - 2047.28] need for their pregnancies for birthing
[2044.88 - 2050.80] children the same adrenal strength they
[2047.28 - 2054.08] need for having sex the same adrenal
[2050.80 - 2056.64] strength they need to exercise daily
[2054.08 - 2058.64] they're depleting it they're destroying
[2056.64 - 2061.28] their adrenals for the future and
[2058.64 - 2064.08] they're aging themselves faster so when
[2061.28 - 2067.16] they hit their 50s or 40s they're going
[2064.08 - 2070.88] to look like they're in their 60s unlike
[2067.16 - 2074.96] regular enimas which are much safer and
[2070.88 - 2079.00] very safe in many ways coffee enimas
[2074.96 - 2081.32] have a boomerang effect what happens is
[2079.00 - 2084.88] poisons that are actually leaving the
[2081.32 - 2087.12] liver naturally before the enema are
[2084.88 - 2089.40] gathered back up by chemical compounds
[2087.12 - 2092.48] released by the liver to protect the
[2089.40 - 2095.56] brain and the heart and the kidneys the
[2092.48 - 2097.76] liver has to start shutting down but
[2095.56 - 2100.16] then when it goes back to work it's
[2097.76 - 2103.28] collecting as much poisons and toxins in
[2100.16 - 2106.32] the bloodstream as possible so nothing
[2103.28 - 2109.28] leaves it collects them to protect your
[2106.32 - 2112.60] brain and other organs it's a boomerang
[2109.28 - 2115.88] effect it does the opposite you can't
[2112.60 - 2119.40] force the liver to cleanse you can only
[2115.88 - 2121.80] give your liver the necessary tools but
[2119.40 - 2124.40] coffee enemas are not a tool for the
[2121.80 - 2127.24] liver to cleanse it's the opposite it
[2124.40 - 2129.92] shocks the liver into protecting
[2127.24 - 2131.72] becoming a mama bear and protecting the
[2129.92 - 2134.60] brain and other
[2131.72 - 2139.00] organs the true definition to coffee
[2134.60 - 2141.92] enema is robbing Peter to pay Paul and
[2139.00 - 2144.84] that's what's happening it's stealing
[2141.92 - 2148.28] precious adrenaline so the person can
[2144.84 - 2151.80] become euphoric and feel high after the
[2148.28 - 2154.88] coffee enim is done and then feel like
[2151.80 - 2158.64] something good happened when in the end
[2154.88 - 2160.88] they got high off of a Dr adrenaline
[2158.64 - 2163.76] that was tomorrow's
[2160.88 - 2168.96] adrenaline tomorrow's reserves to
[2163.76 - 2173.64] protect you it was adrenaline stolen for
[2168.96 - 2177.68] a quick high with a bad Trend adrenaline
[2173.64 - 2181.64] borrowed for a rainy day now adrenaline
[2177.68 - 2183.28] borrowed used up and thrown away what
[2181.64 - 2186.20] most people will notice when they do a
[2183.28 - 2187.92] coffee enema is accelerated heart rate
[2186.20 - 2189.64] that accelerated heart rate is the
[2187.92 - 2190.96] epinephrine the adrenaline being
[2189.64 - 2193.76] released into the
[2190.96 - 2197.72] bloodstream but keep in mind that that
[2193.76 - 2201.00] accelerated heart rate puts pressure on
[2197.72 - 2204.04] guess what the heart it puts the strain
[2201.00 - 2206.16] on the heart now some people who do a
[2204.04 - 2208.72] coffee enema will get the accelerated
[2206.16 - 2211.44] heart rate right at the beginning right
[2208.72 - 2213.76] at the start and it'll push all the way
[2211.44 - 2216.20] through some people it's a little
[2213.76 - 2219.36] delayed The Accelerated heart rate goes
[2216.20 - 2221.68] up but it's not is noticeable but after
[2219.36 - 2224.32] the coffee ena's done the accelerated
[2221.68 - 2228.08] heart rate goes much higher at that
[2224.32 - 2230.52] point it's euphoric it feels good it
[2228.08 - 2232.40] feels like an accomplishment and when
[2230.52 - 2235.52] you think you're releasing all these
[2232.40 - 2237.28] toxins and you're helping your liver
[2235.52 - 2239.80] it's kind of twofold it's like I just
[2237.28 - 2243.24] did something really good for my liver I
[2239.80 - 2244.60] just helped myself and I feel great I'm
[2243.24 - 2247.96] going to recommend this for somebody
[2244.60 - 2250.60] else to do but keep in mind if you're
[2247.96 - 2252.92] going to do a coffee anema anyway and
[2250.60 - 2254.80] even listening to this you say to
[2252.92 - 2258.48] yourself I'm not going to listen to this
[2254.80 - 2260.00] guy I'm going to do one because the
[2258.48 - 2261.72] health professionals are saying it's
[2260.00 - 2264.92] good the influencers are saying it's
[2261.72 - 2267.44] good I want to try it then take this
[2264.92 - 2270.32] information very seriously do not hold
[2267.44 - 2272.84] it in long if you're going to do one no
[2270.32 - 2275.52] matter what you got your own free will
[2272.84 - 2278.52] and you're going to do it do not hold
[2275.52 - 2281.64] the coffee in long term
[2278.52 - 2285.08] quick in and a quick out do not hold it
[2281.64 - 2288.64] in there you can get really sick I've
[2285.08 - 2291.96] seen people out there and I know that
[2288.64 - 2293.80] you can get very very ill and even
[2291.96 - 2296.76] damage your own central nervous system
[2293.80 - 2299.32] doing it and consecutively if you're
[2296.76 - 2301.40] doing it often or you're doing it a lot
[2299.32 - 2304.96] and at the beginning things are going
[2301.40 - 2306.80] okay but by the 10th time or the 50th
[2304.96 - 2308.28] time it's eventually going to bite you
[2306.80 - 2309.96] on the ass
[2308.28 - 2311.76] and you're going to be highly reactive
[2309.96 - 2313.44] to a coffee enema where your whole body
[2311.76 - 2316.64] is going to shake and go into
[2313.44 - 2319.28] convulsions and Tremors and the bad part
[2316.64 - 2321.68] about that is even when the coffee enema
[2319.28 - 2323.76] is done those shakes and those
[2321.68 - 2327.40] convulsions and those Tremors could
[2323.76 - 2330.60] always be there at a hairline trigger
[2327.40 - 2333.16] that means they're hovering from behind
[2330.60 - 2335.88] and something else can trigger them easy
[2333.16 - 2338.40] meanwhile the coffee enemas were truly
[2335.88 - 2341.04] the thing that really pushed over the
[2338.40 - 2343.76] edge and if you're somebody that feels
[2341.04 - 2346.20] you were harmed by coffee enemas or you
[2343.76 - 2348.72] knew it was hurting you at the time or
[2346.20 - 2350.84] you're concerned about it look into
[2348.72 - 2353.24] medical medium information ask your
[2350.84 - 2356.68] doctor if it's right for you what you'll
[2353.24 - 2359.04] find is it doesn't promote adrenaline to
[2356.68 - 2362.60] just be pouring out everywhere it
[2359.04 - 2365.92] doesn't promote aging it doesn't promote
[2362.60 - 2368.68] caffeine instead it doesn't give you a
[2365.92 - 2370.76] high it restores the body so you don't
[2368.68 - 2373.24] need stimulants at some point in your
[2370.76 - 2375.36] life down the road cuz a lot of people
[2373.24 - 2377.32] they're on stimulants every day they're
[2375.36 - 2379.92] looking for that adrenaline high and
[2377.32 - 2381.68] they do trends like cold plunging or
[2379.92 - 2384.52] coffee enas where they're getting this
[2381.68 - 2386.92] excessive adrenaline rush and they feel
[2384.52 - 2388.92] like it's moving them forward but in the
[2386.92 - 2391.76] end it's hurting them because it's
[2388.92 - 2394.68] putting the body in fight or flight
[2391.76 - 2397.60] because the body thinks it's in danger
[2394.68 - 2400.04] the brain thinks it's in danger now for
[2397.60 - 2401.84] the ones that feel that I didn't maybe
[2400.04 - 2405.48] give enough information on the cold
[2401.84 - 2407.88] plunging claim that it's not good for us
[2405.48 - 2411.92] keep in mind when you stick yourself in
[2407.88 - 2415.56] ice water the body is under threat and
[2411.92 - 2417.92] the brain is under threat and the body
[2415.56 - 2420.28] is looking to protect itself so it's
[2417.92 - 2423.16] releasing adrenaline to keep the brain
[2420.28 - 2425.68] from freezing and that becomes an
[2423.16 - 2428.04] adrenaline High which makes people feel
[2425.68 - 2430.88] like whoa they're super human or they
[2428.04 - 2433.76] get that rush like it's incredible and
[2430.88 - 2435.48] cold plunging is not for everyone I was
[2433.76 - 2437.44] the first person to put that information
[2435.48 - 2439.28] out there and now influencers are just
[2437.44 - 2442.04] starting to talk about that too because
[2439.28 - 2444.16] they know that if you push it too far
[2442.04 - 2445.92] you can get hurt and they know the
[2444.16 - 2447.80] medical medium information has been
[2445.92 - 2451.28] talking about that for quite a while out
[2447.80 - 2453.36] there so but the coffee enema same thing
[2451.28 - 2455.44] if you pushed yourself too far with it
[2453.36 - 2457.28] or you've been involved with it know
[2455.44 - 2460.44] that there's healing you can do rest
[2457.28 - 2464.24] restorative healing that doesn't require
[2460.44 - 2464.24] robbing Peter to pay
[2469.64 - 2474.72] Paul feels so much
[2472.40 - 2477.44] better that's that's feels so much
[2474.72 - 2479.92] better I feel like really
[2477.44 - 2481.68] good I'm going to do another coffee anal
[2479.92 - 2482.52] I got to get online and start talking
[2481.68 - 2486.24] about
[2482.52 - 2489.24] this all right let me just flush for a
[2486.24 - 2489.24] second
