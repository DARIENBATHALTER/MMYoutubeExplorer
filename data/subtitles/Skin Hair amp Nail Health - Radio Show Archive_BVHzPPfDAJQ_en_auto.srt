complicated out there they're making it

124
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,960

and the answers they get whether it's

132
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:12,800
labels or whatever is still a mystery

133
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,919
it's still a mystery every every bit

134
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,320
about it and you guys know that by now

135
00:05:14,919 --> 00:05:19,720
come on and you know that by listening

00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:24,600
that we need to change that we need to

138
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:26,520
change that we really do and so they

139
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,199
make it complicated they blame you they

140
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,600
blame you it's you your body attacking

141
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:31,560
itself it's your genes you got bad

142
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,840
faulty jees it's your problem there your

143
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:36,840
DNA is all screwed up and they blame it

144
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,840
on you and that's how it's done that's

145
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,960
how it's done from the top that's the

146
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:43,199
trickery from the top the problem is

147
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,560
good-hearted good-hearted loving

148
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:48,160
compassionate professionals have to

149
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:49,960
follow the misinformation that's from

150
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,680
the top because they have nowhere else

151
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,280
to go they don't have a voice that's

152
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,120
telling them what the truth is in their

153
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,639
ear so they have no choice but they'll

154
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,639
learn the stuff that's complicated and

155
00:05:57,639 --> 00:06:02,560
then just then it just gets Trinkle on

156
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:05,319
down the line and it has to change it

157
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,840
has to change anyway we're back we're

158
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:10,000
back on we're back on skin hair and

159
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:13,560
nails okay so let's let's uh let's start

160
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,080
diving into this so what happens with

161
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:18,120
the skin why are we so concerned with

162
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,680

00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,919

206
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,520
put on the skin and on skin issues that

207
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,960
people are really concerned about

208
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:15,000
there's stuff like that all right

209
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:18,879
there's creams to soften skin a little

210
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:22,840
bit and moisturize skin but it's not

211
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:25,759
going to fix skin problems in a way that

212
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:29,280
we want want that's why people go to

213
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:31,159
plastic surgery and people go to Botox

214
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,240
cuz theyve tried hundreds of creams

215
00:08:31,159 --> 00:08:35,440
before they end up going to Botox then

216
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:39,279
we got a whole young crowd now doing

217
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:41,800
Botox so Botox is so in at this point we

218
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:44,399
have all the you know 18 19 20 year olds

219
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:47,680
doing Botox now 22 year olds 23 year

220
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:50,839
olds in fact it's so in it's it's just

221
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:53,600
it's just part of the culture of today

222
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:56,760
and it's about getting the skin is tight

223
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:59,959
as possible getting the skin as Flawless

224
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:02,120
as possible but all this all of it all

225
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:04,920
of it all of it isn't the answers truly

226
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:06,800
as far as where skin problems go wrong

227
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,959
to begin with why we wrinkle why the

228
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,160
skin loosens up why it ages why all

229
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:14,079
these different things go on why we get

230
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:15,839
all these weird blemishes we get liver

231
00:09:14,079 --> 00:09:18,000
spots and everything else liver spots

232
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:21,240
exactly that's a clue that's a clue

233
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,720
that's a clue liver spots that's a clue

234
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:27,839
the clue is it's deeper it's deeper when

235
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:30,040
it comes down to skin it's deeper so we

236
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:32,760
need to always know that we need to

237
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:36,480
always understand that so we can get our

238
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:41,360
skin to last longer without having to

239
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:43,800
manipulate the skin in other ways to be

240
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,040
you know to feel good or look good or be

241
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:48,240
accepted in today's society which we're

242
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:52,720
going into you know back in the

243
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:54,680

00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:57,880

plastic surgery I'll tell you that right

247
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:04,160

253
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:18,040
these options that make us feel like

254
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:21,240
let's not try anything else let's not go

255
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:23,360
deep let's not go deep down into the

256
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,480
body to try to heal something or fix

that I was like hey that's pretty cool

267
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:48,320

268
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:50,399

269
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,680
um and I respect that and I honor that

270
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,920
and if it's what makes you feel good

271
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:56,880
it's what gets you up in the morning

272
00:10:53,920 --> 00:11:00,200
it's what gets you in a better place in

273
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:03,480
your life I support it 100% okay I'm not

274
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:06,600
a big fan of Botox but I support what

275
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:08,839
makes you feel better and if that's what

276
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,680
you have to do I support it I want you

277
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:12,360
to know that I respect it I support it

278
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:14,480
I'm behind you you know what happens is

279
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:16,279
that there also this thing if someone

280
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,800
doesn't feel good they don't feel good

281
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:20,000
mentally they don't feel good

282
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:21,880
emotionally about how they feel about

283
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,320
themselves how they look and all that

284
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:26,079
then and and then I have to honor that

285
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,000
because that doesn't work for them

286
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,480
either if someone's miserable all day

287
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
long and they're miserable

288
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:33,040
and every morning they're miserable cuz

289
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,920
they feel like you know that they have

290
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,440
to they that that Botox will change

291
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,920
their life and change that I'm on board

292
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,360
someone's that

293
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:43,279
miserable um you know and they're so

294
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,200
depressed and they're just like you know

295
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:47,320
what I need I need to do this because I

296
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,000
can't I can't face people at work I

297
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:51,399
can't there's something inside of

298
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,200
someone that's really bringing them down

299
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:55,880
and then I understand why someone would

300
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:58,120
do that so hey I support if someone

301
00:11:55,880 --> 00:12:00,839
needs to do them do themselves they need

302
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:03,320
to be themselves in some way but but but

303
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:05,800
but let's address I like doing things

304
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:08,320
naturally deep down inside let's address

305
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:11,720
what creates skin problems deep down

306
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:14,160
inside let's address what creates

307
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:15,720
problems deep down inside so you know

308
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,360
and listen if you're someone who hasn't

309
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,959
gotten Botox or anything I'm not trying

310
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,480
to tell you to go running off and and

311
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,760
get that you know that don't run off and

312
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,440
get that I want you to addess what's

313
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,440
deep inside that's the way I handle

314
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,320
things and want to handle things but as

315
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,959
I said before if that's what you've done

316
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:31,560
I stand behind you too and you should

317
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:33,360
still you should still go deep down

318
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:35,959
inside and do some healing down there so

319
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:38,600
even if you had say plastic surgery even

320
00:12:35,959 --> 00:12:42,480
if you had cosmetic surgery even if you

321
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:44,959
had Botox I want you 100% still doing

322
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,720
things to take care of what's inside

323
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:50,480
because that's going to help you for

324
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:53,680
everything and every

325
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:57,240
reason okay so that that's what matters

326
00:12:53,680 --> 00:13:01,240
so skin problems the liver the liver the

327
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:03,399
liver it plays such a role in aging and

328
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:05,480
skin problems and wrinkles and and

329
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:07,839
everything else the liver the liver gets

330
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:11,720
toxic our livers get toxic they come

331
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:15,800
here toxic from our parents yeah they

332
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:20,199
come here um toxic from forefathers they

333
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:23,519
come here with DDT in them from a 100

334
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:26,639
years ago they come with heavy metals

335
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:29,240
from a thousand years ago they come with

336
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:32,120
plastics they come with petrol oil from

337
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:34,800
our parents pumping their own gas okay

338
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:36,680
they come with that the livers and we

339
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,600
come into town with these livers you

340
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:41,839
know what I mean and these livers Harbor

341
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,360
a lot of toxins a lot of poisons and we

342
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:44,720
can get fatty liver we can get all kinds

343
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:48,440
of liver problems I know this isn't a

344
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:50,560
liver show and um which we did in the

345
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:54,440
past and we do another one in the future

346
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:57,079
too but but that's one of the places

347
00:13:54,440 --> 00:14:00,639
it's like the that's the area that's

348
00:13:57,079 --> 00:14:03,360
origin the origin one of the Origins so

349
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:05,240
it's not about how to carry your skin on

350
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,800
the outside so much sure there's there's

351
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:09,519
some really good natural moisturizers

352
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:11,160
moisturizers with essential oils there's

353
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:15,720
all kinds of different options out there

354
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:17,800
to get the skin to look flashy to look

355
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:20,880
cleaner to look a certain way to feel

356
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:22,680
moist whatever it's all good but you

357
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:25,920
still want to address what's deep down

358
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:27,639
inside and that that's so critical so

359
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,480
when it comes down to skin it's about

360
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:32,000
getting your liver better a big part of

361
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:35,839
it and we're going to talk about what

362
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:38,279
makes skin hair nails not so great and

363
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:40,839
the liver for the skin is one of those

364
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:42,519
things so when it comes down to that

365
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:46,240
that's where we are so what happens down

366
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:48,079
in there your liver is is receiving a

367
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:51,399
tremendous amount of blood it's pumping

368
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:54,519
in it's pouring in it's a river of blood

369
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:58,160
gushing into that and into that liver a

370
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:59,519
river of blood it's got oxygen it's got

371
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,320
a lot of things things going on there

372
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:04,120
nutrients you name it and the liver but

373
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,839
it's got a ton of poisons in there too

374
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,600
just pumping into the liver liver has to

375
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,560
filter out clean it process it get it

376
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,160
ready get it ready to send back up to

377
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:13,800
the heart get it ready to send back all

378
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:17,120
to the other places getting ready to

379
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:21,360
send back to you so that blood is

380
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:23,800
cleaner and gets to your epidermis your

381
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,800
epidermis your skin you cut your skin

382
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:27,600
right there that epidermis there right

383
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:30,160
there you cut that little top layer that

384
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,600
little little hunk of epidermis tissue

385
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:34,519
right there you cut that it bleeds you

386
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,360
scratch that it bleeds how is that

387
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:39,040
possible cuz blood seeps all the way up

388
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:40,440
through the uh subcutaneous fat level

389
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,160
level that's underneath there and it

390
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:45,040
seeps right through and it and it just

391
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:46,759
finds its way in the epidermis the blood

392
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:50,399
the oxygen everything travels through

393
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:51,759
tiny microvessels and it gets there and

394
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:55,000
it

395
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:58,079
nourishes nourishes the skin all those

396
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,880
little blood vessels the liver nourishes

397
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:01,199
the skin yeah your heart pumps the blood

398
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,920
of course pumping blood through your

399
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:04,720
body your blood's being pumped you got a

400
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:07,560
pump you got a pump like a water pump in

401
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:10,319
a car yeah sure you have that you got

402
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:12,959
the pump and um like a sub pump in a

403
00:16:10,319 --> 00:16:14,639
basement like a water pump in a car like

404
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:17,639
uh like whatever you know what I mean

405
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:19,839
and so the deal is though that's the

406
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:21,959
liver that has to be the responsible one

407
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:25,199
to make sure that blood's prepped ready

408
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:29,120
go clean good whatnot if that liver is

409
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:32,600
sending up sending up

410
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,880
material in that blood it's not so great

411
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:36,199
you're going to age fast you're going to

412
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:37,480

450
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:58,080
had it right when they sliced those

451
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,200
cucumber slices and stuck them in

452
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:04,440
people's eye

453
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:07,679
sockets somebody had it right all right

454
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:09,799
and and so that's what you need to do um

455
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,280
to help the liver right there you know

456
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:12,840
listen you can help the liver with all

457
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,320
kinds of things stay away from the fried

458
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:17,880
greasy Foods stay away from high fat

459
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:21,080
foods if you're a Paleo dude if you're a

460
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:23,679
Paleo chick you just just cut the fat

461
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:25,520
levels down that means make sure that

462
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:28,600
Meats the leanest you could find and

463
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:31,760
only have it once a day because you need

464
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:33,440
room for all those fruits and vegetables

465
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:36,039
that's going to cleanse your liver

466
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:38,720
because a piece of lean meat whether I

467
00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:40,919
like it or not or whatever whether

468
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,480
Spirit likes it or not or you like it or

469
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:46,000
not a piece of lean meat does not heal

470
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:48,840
the liver that's not how it works that

471
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,960
that doesn't help your liver but I

472
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:53,640
support it 100% if someone I support all

473
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:55,200
diets you want you know paleo diet love

474
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:57,080
you want vegan diet love whatever I

475
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,640
support it all but the point is I'm

476
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:00,919
talking about what's going to help the

477
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,919
liver so if you if you think you got

478
00:19:00,919 --> 00:19:05,600
some liver stuff going on you want your

479
00:19:02,919 --> 00:19:09,000
skin really nice you cut your animal

480
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:11,080
protein down in half I'm not telling you

481
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,039
you have to quit it that's not my job

482
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:15,640
I'm not the food police I'm not the food

483
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:18,000
police okay I'm just giving you some

484
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:20,440
pieces of truth and you can take it you

485
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,280
can throw it away but I would take it

486
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:24,919
I'd cut the animal protein in half have

487
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:27,440
it once a day your favorite one okay

488
00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:29,720
make sure it's the clean and lean stuff

489
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:32,080
so it's not so load it with fats stay

490
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:36,600
off the butter stay off the cheese stay

491
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:38,799
off the eggs and and keep your fats low

492
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:40,360
so if you like your salmon you like your

493
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:43,559
you know you like your hbit you like

494
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:45,640
your hache you like your salmon um you

495
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:47,320
know that's that can work too if you

496
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,960
like your lean you know lean chicken

497
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:51,960
breast if you like your lean turkey

498
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:55,039
breast that could work too free range

499
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:56,640
farm raised in a good Farm the whole bit

500
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:58,640
you know antibiotic free that's great

501
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,559
you know grass-fed beef the lean stuff

502
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:03,080
not the brisket that's filled with fat

503
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:04,960
all that fat in the brisket not the pork

504
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:07,919
stay away from the stay away from the

505
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,880
pork okay stay away from that because

506
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:13,159
that's not going to help your skin it's

507
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:15,000
going to age your skin it's going to age

508
00:20:13,159 --> 00:20:16,559
it okay yeah sure your skin might have

509
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,919
got better because you cleaned up your

510
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:20,720
diet yeah but it got better maybe

511
00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:23,520
because you stopped you know donuts and

512
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:25,960
you stopped bagels and you stopped you

513
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,679
canoli and you stopped danishes and you

514
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:29,400
stopped a lot of that and and maybe you

515
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:32,880
stopped fr food and maybe you stopped

516
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:35,240
really greasy fried bad oils and sure it

517
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:38,360
got better but it could get even better

518
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:41,360
it could get even better if you keep the

519
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:43,240
animal proteins down a notch the reason

520
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,640
why is your skin needs something so

521
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:46,320
critical you guys I'm going to tell you

522
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,919
right now what it is it's not just clean

523
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:51,440
blood it's not just the river of clean

524
00:20:48,919 --> 00:20:55,559
blood coming from that

525
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:58,240
liver your skin needs the beta carotenes

526
00:20:55,559 --> 00:21:00,520
and there's no beta carotene in a high

527
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:03,039
fat diet there's no beta carotene in a

528
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:04,600
really high animal protein diet and

529
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:06,320
people eat vegan diets with no beta

530
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:08,000
carotene in there either I'm not picking

531
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:10,000
on the meat eaters I'll pick on the

532
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,360
vegans why not I'll pick on the

533
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,400
vegetarians I'll pick on everybody then

534
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:16,320
okay and what I'm saying is you can have

535
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:19,720
a vegetarian diet and have virtually no

536
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:22,679
Betty kattin in that diet that's right

537
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:25,520
that's right okay and and what happens

538
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:27,919
is that skin needs it

539
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:31,240
desperately where do those beta keratin

540
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:34,120
go come from they come from leafy greens

541
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:36,480
leafy greens so you have your chicken

542
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:38,400
salad and some leafy greens spinage

543
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,919
chicken salad right that's what you

544
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:43,360
really like if you're vegan you have the

545
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:45,320
spinach and you throw in some fruit in

546
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:47,360
there throw in anything in your salad if

547
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:51,279
you're vegan hey you know you probably

548
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:53,000
already know but you don't want less

549
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:55,279
beta carotene where else does the beta

550
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:59,279
carotene come from comes from the

551
00:21:55,279 --> 00:22:03,000
powerful color and those mangoes

552
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:06,720
mangoes but if you're mango afraid or

553
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:10,320
papaya afraid papayas are incredible the

554
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:15,400
beta keratin the keratins keratinoid in

555
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:18,360
papaya are incredible for the skin

556
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:20,440
lifechanging for the skin that papaya

557
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:22,080
because those keratins get right up up

558
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:25,360
through that subcutaneous fat they get

559
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:28,039
driven in the river of blood your liver

560
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,480
knows you need those keratins for your

561
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:30,919
skin but but if you don't provide with

562
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:33,120
the liver with what it knows then it's

563
00:22:30,919 --> 00:22:34,480
sending up blood that's deficient of

564
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:39,480
what it

565
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:41,200
needs that's right that's right so you

566
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:43,320
need that River blood loaded with those

567
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:45,640
keratins you could even get slightly

568
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:48,159
orange skin which is a beautiful thing a

569
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:50,279
beautiful thing that occurs when you've

570
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:53,240
been eating a lot of papaya a lot of

571
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:56,120
mangoes a lot of sweet potatoes a lot of

572
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:58,440
Mam Mam is like a um you know a fruit

573
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:00,480
that's that not a lot of people can find

574
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:03,600
that's more of a tougher One beta

575
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:05,760
keratin lot of raspberries okay but

576
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:09,200
especially things like the mangoes the

577
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:10,720
papayas um and it melons with color in

578
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,120
them melons with color have a lot of

579
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:15,200
beta Kines and then in the vegetable

580
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:17,799
Department leafy green spinach spinach

581
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,080
is like one of the ultimate beta

582
00:23:17,799 --> 00:23:23,080
carotene

583
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:24,559
providers it re it really is and that is

584
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:26,159
incredible for the liver liver can use

585
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:28,039
spinach to cleanse cleanse out poisons

586
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,919
cleanse out toxins right you guys

587
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:33,200
cleanse out all those Metals cleanse out

588
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:36,880
everything but the liver can also take

589
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:39,840
all that carotene and what it does is it

590
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:42,039
tags that carotene it tags it and it

591
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:45,520
changes it and manipulates it a little

592
00:23:42,039 --> 00:23:48,120
bit it makes it capable of surviving the

593
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:52,200
travel up to the

594
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:56,200
skin it makes it possible to travel to

595
00:23:52,200 --> 00:24:00,279
the skin it works with it the liver is

596
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:02,159
the the machine that changes and Alters

597
00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:05,360
compounds chemical compounds it's the

598
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:07,720
chemical compound master and so it

599
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,559
Alters those keratin and it sends it

600
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:10,760
back up to the Derma didn't I tell you I

601
00:24:09,559 --> 00:24:12,520
was going to give you information never

602
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,720
heard before didn't I tell you didn't I

603
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:16,520
tell you I told you that in a couple

604
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:18,520
shows ago maybe comes from Spirit that's

605
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:21,240
what I'm talking about and it's not

606
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:23,279
misinformation this stuff is powerful it

607
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:25,240
is powerful and it is real so that's

608
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:29,320
what the liver does what it does is it

609
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:33,520
tags those catenoids it Chang ches them

610
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:35,919
it Alters them it allows a form of

611
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:38,240
methylation no one has their hands on

612
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:39,679
yet in science or research a form of

613
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,799
methylation different than other

614
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:45,600
methylations that we talk about and it

615
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:48,760
it packages it and it sends it on its

616
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:50,960
way fueled what I mean by fueled is the

617
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:53,360
blood is fueled in a different way to

618
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:55,440
take the keratine up in there if the

619
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:58,720
liver knows keratins are going to go to

620
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:02,039
the skin it's going to make sure oxygen

621
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:03,399
supply is more so in that package that's

622
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:07,520
being delivered up through the blood up

623
00:25:03,399 --> 00:25:09,320
to the skin and that's how it's done so

624
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,960
if your salad just has some iceberg

625
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:13,039
lettuce and it has a little kind of you

626
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:15,559
know an orange tomato that's not so

627
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:17,279
great got some chicken or tuna in there

628
00:25:15,559 --> 00:25:18,720
that's your lunch with a little mayo I

629
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:20,279
don't know what people do they make the

630
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,200
may they you know whatever the yeah the

631
00:25:20,279 --> 00:25:24,320
mayonnaise the whole bit or you got an

632
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:26,240
egg in your salad and you got you know

633
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:28,320
couple of tomatoes maybe you a couple

634
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,600
little tiny pieces of cucumber

635
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,720
and a couple of eggs in your salad and

636
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:35,320
and and yeah some tuna and some other

637
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:37,080
things or some sliced cold cuts in your

638
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:40,320
salad the antipasta salads or whatever

639
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:43,039
it's not enough it's not enough got to

640
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:45,559
get piece of papaya out have that for

641
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:48,399
breakfast you got to do your heavy metal

642
00:25:45,559 --> 00:25:50,200
detox cleanse clean clean out that liver

643
00:25:48,399 --> 00:25:53,640
of all the pesticides of all the heavy

644
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:56,080
metals get them out right you got to do

645
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:58,840
more and if it's overwhelming if it

646
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:01,880
feels too much take take it slow take it

647
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:04,200
slow you know slow ride just take it

648
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:06,520
easy and then take it slow that's the

649
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:09,440
bottom line and that's okay that there's

650
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:13,240
nothing wrong with that either so kot

651
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:16,039
kotes mean everything when it comes to

652
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:17,440
skin how the skin looks what it does it

653
00:26:16,039 --> 00:26:21,440
means everything and then there's

654
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:24,600
something else too there's silica hidden

655
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:26,640
in vegetables and stems of vegetables

656
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:28,720
that matter for the skin that tighten

657
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:31,240
the skin silic that's just geared for

658
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,600
the skin not silica geared for the bones

659
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:34,320
there's two different kinds science

660
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:36,240
doesn't know that yet science doesn't

661
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:38,159
actually know science and research I'm

662
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:41,039
going to give you another science fact

663
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:43,799
that will come out years down the road

664
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:46,880
and silica for the bones is different

665
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:49,399
than silica for the skin they're two

666
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:51,679
different kinds two different kinds

667
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:55,440
science hasn't T hasn't separated them

668
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:58,000
yet and the kind that just goes for the

669
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:00,720
skin up to the skin is one variety of

670
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:04,039
silica that the liver works on making

671
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:05,600
sure you know you're provided and that's

672
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:07,880
through

673
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:10,600
asparagus those beautiful

674
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:11,720
asparagus okay that's one place it comes

675
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:13,679
from

676
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:15,799
artichokes artichokes which is

677
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:18,000
incredible for the liver lots of silicon

678
00:27:15,799 --> 00:27:19,320
artichokes if you look up artichokes and

679
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,320
you find there's no silicon in there

680
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:23,840
it's because they just didn't they just

681
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:26,200
didn't add that part in did you know

682
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:28,640
artichokes have a thousand chemical

683
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:31,159
compounds vitamins mineral subgroups

684
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:33,039
amino acids everything undiscovered

685
00:27:31,159 --> 00:27:36,320
science research just isn't getting it

686
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:39,240
done in the lab same way other things

687
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:41,840
don't work in this world where nothing

688
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:44,000
gets done in all that systematic stuff

689
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:46,120
that you know that whole realm you know

690
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,640
what I'm talking about how nothing

691
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:50,640
really gets done how it takes you know

692
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,799
takes 30 years to get something

693
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:55,039
straightened out at the motor vehicle

694
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:58,519
okay so you don't need you don't need a

695
00:27:55,039 --> 00:28:02,760
lesson on how the world works

696
00:27:58,519 --> 00:28:04,960
on that level so the bottom line is is

697
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:07,840
artichokes you got the asparagus it's

698
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:11,960
really good stems little stems of the

699
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:15,039
kale have silica in them for the skin

700
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:17,760
that's another thing horse tail the herb

701
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:19,880
nettle Leaf the herb you can take horse

702
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:21,320
tail horsetail is known to help help to

703
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:23,240
help skin hair and nails that's because

704
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:24,840
of the type of silica but but it's still

705
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:26,679
it's still not the same silica that goes

706
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:29,120
to Bones technically it's still there's

707
00:28:26,679 --> 00:28:30,960
two kinds that are are in horsetail

708
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:32,640
there's two kinds of silica in Nettle

709
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,320
Leaf there's two kinds of silica in

710
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,519
these other things and they get

711
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:38,720
separated by the liver and delivered

712
00:28:36,519 --> 00:28:40,480
that's brand new information I'm just

713
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:44,000
putting out there for you guys so you

714
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:46,120
guys have things to heal and you know

715
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,120
these are just different things for the

716
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:50,519
skin we're talking about now the big

717
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:54,760
skin I hope we can get to Hair and Nails

718
00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:57,000
I swear the big skin thing all the time

719
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:58,640
is protein protein protein protein

720
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,760
protein protein you need protein you

721
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:04,440
need protein oh my God dear God if I

722
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:06,360
hear protein one more time out there

723
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:08,159
okay because it's literally just all

724
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:09,799
people kind of know in the health realm

725
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:12,399
professional realm is is protein they've

726
00:29:09,799 --> 00:29:15,039
been brainwashed to thinking protein

727
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:17,760
stands for everything it doesn't it

728
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:19,760
doesn't I can go I could do a show just

729
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:21,200
on protein and yeah people will throw

730
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:23,559
Rotten Tomatoes at me and rotten

731
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:25,080
potatoes at me and stones and rocks and

732
00:29:23,559 --> 00:29:27,799
they'll have torches and pitchforks and

733
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:29,840
try to burn my house down absolutely

734
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:32,039
because that's how ingrained protein is

735
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:33,600
into the system right now you can't eat

736
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:36,039
that's like literally that's

737
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,760
controversial that's controversal it's

738
00:29:36,039 --> 00:29:39,840
not politically correct to talk about

739
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:43,080
protein right now so I have I have to be

740
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:45,000
careful isn't that silly so the deal is

741
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:46,240
is that yes proteins are important

742
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,559
they're important when they come from a

743
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,320
kale Leaf they're important when they

744
00:29:47,559 --> 00:29:50,799
come from a spinach leaf spinach they're

745
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:53,519
important from they they come from a

746
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:55,200
lentil a lentil they're important when

747
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:58,440
they come from a black bean they're

748
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:00,519
important when they come from a walnut

749
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:03,320
because those are important proteins but

750
00:30:00,519 --> 00:30:05,760
those proteins that come from there

751
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:09,200
still aren't really what hair skin and

752
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:12,519
nails are are derived from or made made

753
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:15,240
out of because there's thousands and

754
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:16,960
hundreds of different of of of compounds

755
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:19,039
and chemical functions and different

756
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:21,360
minerals and vitamins and subgroups that

757
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:25,480
I'm talking about that are

758
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:29,200
responsible for Hair Skin and nails and

759
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:32,080
the liver is like the master behind that

760
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:33,919
one of the Masters especially the master

761
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:36,039
so very important to understand so you

762
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:38,080
need to know it's not about more protein

763
00:30:36,039 --> 00:30:39,840
more protein the more protein you do the

764
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:42,120
more tired the liver gets though you got

765
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:44,799
to be careful the more tired the liver

766
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:46,919
gets the more protein you do so you got

767
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:48,720
to keep you like like I'm saying if you

768
00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:51,360
are vegan you got to be careful you

769
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:53,039
don't do just an all vegan protein diet

770
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:55,600
you got to be careful it's not just all

771
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:58,240
protein shakes if you're a vegan you got

772
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:00,440
to be careful about that there's plenty

773
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:02,440
of protein in spirulina there's plenty

774
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:03,919
of protein in barley grass juice powder

775
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:05,399
there's plenty of protein in fruits and

776
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:06,720
vegetables there's plenty of proteins

777
00:31:05,399 --> 00:31:09,960
and even sweet potatoes you got to be

778
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:11,519
careful though that as a vegan or a raw

779
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:14,399
food vegan or whatever that you're not

780
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:16,360
just trying to reach protein needs 24/7

781
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:18,639
you got to be cautious on that and if

782
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:20,399
you're a Paleo person you got to watch

783
00:31:18,639 --> 00:31:22,440
out you don't over inh aate with the

784
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:24,200
animal protein you got to cut it back a

785
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:25,840
bit because it will tire out your liver

786
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:28,480
no matter how good shape you think or

787
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:31,480
you're in or how good you feel you still

788
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:32,919
will shorten the life of your liver and

789
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:35,360
affect the Hair Skin and Nails

790
00:31:32,919 --> 00:31:37,639
eventually somehow some way some some

791
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:39,840
possibility if you say well how come one

792
00:31:37,639 --> 00:31:42,000
person's hair skin and Nails goes bad

793
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:44,200
and the other one doesn't because I told

794
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,799
you you come in here with liver stuff

795
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:47,240
that you inherit some people inherit a

796
00:31:45,799 --> 00:31:49,519
hell of a lot more with the liver than

797
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:51,320
other people some people have so much

798
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:54,080
stress in their life early on that their

799
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:57,639
adrenals cause problems with their liver

800
00:31:54,080 --> 00:32:00,120
and adrenaline kills Hair Skin and nails

801
00:31:57,639 --> 00:32:03,639
you go through a loss of a loved one

802
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:06,000
your hair a year later can be shot shot

803
00:32:03,639 --> 00:32:07,840
I've watched it I've seen it for decades

804
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,360
you go through a trying time you get

805
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:11,639
betrayal betrayal happens which is some

806
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:13,480
of the worst things that could ever

807
00:32:11,639 --> 00:32:16,240
happen is when someone betrays you oh

808
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:18,440
dear lord it's probably one of the worst

809
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,440
and when you're betrayed you know your

810
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:23,440
hair falls apart it could fall out of

811
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:26,240
your head it can it can just it can just

812
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:28,120
come out not just that be come out like

813
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,639
straw turn into to straw and if it

814
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:32,240
doesn't turn in straw that week it can

815
00:32:29,639 --> 00:32:34,440
turn in straw a year later this is

816
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:38,039
because of adrenaline this is because of

817
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:39,720
you know the pain we get from fear and

818
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:41,440
insecurity and being up because we've

819
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:44,080
been Something's Happened or trustman

820
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:46,200
broken or you know a loss in Life or

821
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,919
financial burden or stress or whatever

822
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,480
it

823
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:52,120
is it cranks up the adrenaline

824
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:54,399
adrenaline's corrosive it hinders the

825
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:57,279
lier it hinders everything it's okay

826
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:59,039
it's just a natural part of life I mean

827
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:02,039
but it hinders things and it knocks the

828
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:03,720
skin back it stretches the skin and if

829
00:33:02,039 --> 00:33:04,840
you're worried about you you go to a

830
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,799
practitioner and they're all just

831
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:09,480
talking protein and only protein it's

832
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:10,679
like just that's not the answer either

833
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:12,240
of course they give you a bunch of

834
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:13,559
supplements though different supplements

835
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,240
and that could improve your health but

836
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:18,279
it wasn't the protein that did you need

837
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,919
to know you know it's other things

838
00:33:18,279 --> 00:33:21,880
supplements and everything else so just

839
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:23,559
keep that feather in your cap too for

840
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:25,679
the person that says well I went to my

841
00:33:23,559 --> 00:33:28,120
doctor my doctor said I had severe

842
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:30,159
protein deficient efficiency he changed

843
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:31,600
my diet for higher protein I started

844
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:33,279
getting better but he probably gave you

845
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:35,360
10 vitamins too that you never took

846
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:37,120
before in your life and that started

847
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,559
clearing up some deficiencies from all

848
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:40,519
that you've been through and that's why

849
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:41,960
you're improving or took away bad foods

850
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:44,600
and you're not eating cakes and cookies

851
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:47,360
anymore realize it's not protein that is

852
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:49,519
the the answer for all and you look you

853
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:51,200
hair hair care products proteins are in

854
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:52,440
there that's ridiculous you look at all

855
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:55,000
these other things proteins are in there

856
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:57,919
that's not how it works our hair stays

857
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:01,240
good because our adrenal stay good one

858
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:03,360
way to keep hair strong is is

people do ashwaganda for two months and

881
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:54,679

00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:56,919
always know that information's out there

883

know where it originally sourced from it

887
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:06,000
could have come from me easily but the

00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:41,920
here's the deal you look at a skin hair

902
00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:45,040
um formula skin hair nails formula it

903
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:48,440
might have horse tail in it but I can't

904
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:50,200
even tell you how ridiculously small

905
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:54,240
amount of horse tail that could be in

906
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:56,400
there a speck because it's it's made of

907
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:59,319
fillers and plus all these other things

908
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:01,920
maybe herbs maybe amino acids it's all

909
00:35:59,319 --> 00:36:04,119
packed in this tablet but if you took

910
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:07,079
out the horse tail it would be Joker's

911
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:09,760
host you horse tail Joker's horsetail

912
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:11,440
like no joke so if you took out the

913
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:14,359
nettle Leaf in something it would be

914
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:17,480
Joker's nettle leaf and probably a

915
00:36:14,359 --> 00:36:19,839
crappy kind when you take nettle Leaf

916
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:23,040
you know like three capsules a day when

917
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:25,760
you take dropper FS of nettle Leaf daily

918
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:27,440
you get the hair back and by the way

919
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:29,280
that also reflects back into the liver

920
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:31,200
and helps the liver too cuz liver has a

921
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:33,400
lot to do with hair if your liver is

922
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:35,760
maxed out if you're getting a maxed out

923
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:38,040
liver whether the doctor sees it or not

924
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,760
hair can start becoming problem

925
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:41,839
problematic falling out all kinds of

926
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:43,760
different issues dermatitis on the scalp

927
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:46,480
eczema can occur psoriasis I talked

928
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:50,359
about aiment psoriasis in the other show

929
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:52,599
and that could play a role in some some

930
00:36:50,359 --> 00:36:55,280
scalp issue skin you know skin issues on

931
00:36:52,599 --> 00:36:58,119
the head hair loss with that as well

932
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:59,640
alopecia alope IA isn't an autoimmune

933
00:36:58,119 --> 00:37:01,640
disease where the body's attacking the

934
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:03,839
hair follicles and the hair falls out

935
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:06,839
that's misinformation once again the

936
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:08,839
blame is on us for um you know for it

937
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:10,839
being our fault because medical science

938
00:37:08,839 --> 00:37:13,640
and research doesn't know it causes

939
00:37:10,839 --> 00:37:17,119
alopecia don't I sell sound snarky and

940
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:19,160
and sarcastic now today so I have to I

941
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:21,680
can't help it I can't help it I'm not

942
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:23,880
perfect I can't help it but you know

943
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:25,440
what it is is that the alope ship you

944
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:27,359
know people who have that they're told

945
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:29,800
their bodies destroying the air follicle

946
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:32,920
so it's the body's fault no it's an

947
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:35,680
adrenal issue there's a hormone missing

948
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:38,359
out of the adrenal it's one of the

949
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:39,480
because people think medical research

950
00:37:38,359 --> 00:37:41,000
and medical science thinks that

951
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:44,079
adrenaline is just made out of two

952
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:47,200
things like cortisol and epinephrine and

953
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:48,800
and no it's not it's a complicated

954
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:53,400
divide it's a

955
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:55,280
complicated um group group of hormones

956
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:57,560
really complicated science hasn't

957
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:59,240
stripped them apart and one of those

958
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:01,680
hormones coming out of the adrenals

959
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:04,200
that's undocumented undiscovered by

960
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:07,960
Medical Science and medical research is

961
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:10,680
missing missing for the woman that has

962
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:12,599
alopecia it's missing and that's why so

963
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:14,720
the aagana can be a great support to

964
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:17,560
help get that back so a trace of that

965
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:19,960
can come back to the adrenal and get

966
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:22,119
hair to grow back I've had people with

967
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:24,440
alipa lost all their hair nothing could

968
00:38:22,119 --> 00:38:25,839
get it back and then it's come back with

969
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:27,960
doing all the right things getting the

970
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:32,760
liver better getting the adrenals better

971
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:35,720
see the deeper deeper issues deep down

972
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:37,319
inside so um we're going to have to

973
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:40,480
listen to this show again because I'm

974
00:38:37,319 --> 00:38:42,880
going so fast with with the

975
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:46,000

breath in and take a deep breath out

979
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:56,599
relax exhale so um we talked about

980
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:59,040
adrenaline stress and damage causing

981
00:38:56,599 --> 00:39:03,280
hair problems hair falling out can

982
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:05,319
happen months after a breakup a breakup

983
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:08,400
um uh husband and wife break up

984
00:39:05,319 --> 00:39:11,240

later and then it can stay falling out

988
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:20,000
for quite some time because there's

989
00:39:17,079 --> 00:39:22,079

horsetail or not just the silica that I

1002
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:53,960

00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:35,119
that's just I'm sorry but that the

1021
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:37,280
belief system you have to you have to

1022
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:39,560
break a little bit I had to break all my

1023
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:42,760
belief systems I had to break them all

1024
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:45,280
you know Spirit taught me to break

1025
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:47,640
through my belief systems and spirit

1026
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:49,640
said I had no choice I said no no I have

1027
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:52,000
a choice I I'm my own person I could

1028
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:53,839
have a belief system and spirit said no

1029
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,359
you can't if you're going to help people

1030
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:56,440
you can't have a belief system cuz it's

1031
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:57,599
going to be something different for for

1032
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:59,800
someone else and it's going to be a

1033
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:01,680
problem that they need to do and someone

1034
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:03,680
who's told they can't have sugar from

1035
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:05,760
fruit that's a belief system instilled

1036
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:07,839
and if you have that same belief system

1037
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:10,440
you can't help that person spirit said

1038
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:12,280
when I was younger said no you you can't

1039
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:14,240
do this then you're you're not cut for

1040
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:15,760
this job I remember when I said to

1041
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:17,200
Spirit good I don't want the job when I

1042
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,839
was a kid I was I don't want the job

1043
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,839
spirit said too bad yeah you have the

1044
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:22,880
job we can't change that you have the

1045
00:41:20,839 --> 00:41:24,280
job so you have to survive this I said

1046
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:27,160
all right I busted through my belief

1047
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:33,000
systems when I was younger and

1048
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:36,000
so um figs and uh cherries cherries are

1049
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,240
also really good for the liver very good

1050
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,760
for the liver wild blueberries are

1051
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:40,240
really good for the liver too in fact

1052
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:43,359
the most powerful food for the liver but

1053
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:45,200
cherries are good for the liver too so

1054
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:47,040
look for Cherries Berries of all kinds

1055
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:49,520
are good for the liver berries of all

1056
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:53,760
kinds are good for hair skin

1057
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:55,599
nails um and uh and then like I told

1058
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:57,599
told you about for skin the papayas the

1059
00:41:55,599 --> 00:42:02,040
mangoes remember that

1060
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:03,839
bananas bananas bananas are great for

1061
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:05,280
the liver great for the intestinal tract

1062
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:07,000
flushing out poisons at the liver

1063
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:11,480
ascending down to the intestinal tract

1064
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:15,040
so those are great for hair skin nails

1065
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:18,839
now potassium is a critical element for

1066
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:21,319
the skin potassium is it comes from figs

1067
00:42:18,839 --> 00:42:24,440
it comes from avocados it comes from

1068
00:42:21,319 --> 00:42:26,599
bananas that's a good one too all right

1069
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:27,880
now Omega-3s are really good for the

1070
00:42:26,599 --> 00:42:31,240
skin as well so they're really good

1071
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:32,839
Omega-3s hemp seeds walnuts if you're

1072
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:34,480
sensitive to walnuts cuz some people are

1073
00:42:32,839 --> 00:42:36,160
sensitive to nuts and that's true they

1074
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:38,440
are I mean to people everybody's

1075
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:40,559
different exactly so why I had to break

1076
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:42,760
all my belief systems because someone

1077
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:44,200
might not farewell with a walnut they

1078
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:46,280
get sensitive they get they get the

1079
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:47,559
funny kind of feeling from the tannins

1080
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:50,880
of the walnut in their mouth and they

1081
00:42:47,559 --> 00:42:53,359
don't like that but the deal is walnuts

1082

lentils that's a different kind of

1087
00:43:04,119 --> 00:43:09,559
protein when you sprout the lentil the

1088
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,839
protein divides into a carbohydrate

1089
00:43:09,559 --> 00:43:14,359
turns into a

1090
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:16,359
glycogen that carbohydrate is incredible

1091
00:43:14,359 --> 00:43:18,640

these different problems one of the one

1110
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:05,000
of the biggest reasons for that um is

1111
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:07,880
zinc deficiencies real real zinc

1112
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:09,680
deficiencies longstanding pumpkin seeds

00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:30,800
nails you get the bumps in the nails the

1121
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:32,319

pockets you get the whole bit and that's

1124
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:39,359
zinc deficiency partly zinc deficiency

1125
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:42,119
the other part is a liver issue a liver

1126
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:45,040
issue that's the other part of all the

1127
00:44:42,119 --> 00:44:46,680
nail problems that's adrenaline it's a

1128
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:48,760
lot of adrenaline you've been exposed to

1129
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:52,040
in your life from certain circumstances

1130
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:53,960
whether it's been falling in love so you

1132
00:44:53,960 --> 00:45:02,800
Falling in Love Is is explosively

1133
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:05,680
wonderful but takes a toll usually a lot

1134
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:07,839
of people who fall in love the first

1135
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:10,440
time they fall in love that very first

1136
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:14,880
time where it's like that magical moment

1137
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:17,839
you feel inside of you that's hormones

1138
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:19,599
that are produced by your adrenals

1139
00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:21,760
that's the mix it's one of the 56

1140
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:23,760
different blends that I've brought to

1141
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:25,599
the table if you're new to the show and

1142
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:28,119
you've never read book one you got to

1143
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:30,119
learn about the 56 different blends of

1144
00:45:28,119 --> 00:45:32,119
adrenaline that don't exist in research

1145
00:45:30,119 --> 00:45:33,720
and science I don't care what books out

1146
00:45:32,119 --> 00:45:35,200
there I don't care what experts out

1147
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:38,640
there and the top health expert they

1148
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:40,760
don't know about it um yeah I'm boasting

1149
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:44,839
for Spirit not boasting for myself I'm

1150
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:47,359
boasting for spirit so so that explosive

1151
00:45:44,839 --> 00:45:49,160
falling in love thing it's like a it's

1152
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:51,000
like a time bomb though in a sense

1153
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:53,880
meaning like it's the most wonderful

1154
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:56,440
beautiful special thing and at the same

1155
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:59,720
time it wears and tears on the body and

1156
00:45:56,440 --> 00:46:01,440
that's why we've naturally the love

1157
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:05,240
turns into a

1158
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:07,800
compassionate deeper love that that's

1159
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:10,000
more so than the surface explosion love

1160
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:13,079
when you first meet somebody it then

1161
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:15,839
goes into a companionship love a forever

1162
00:46:13,079 --> 00:46:18,119
love a a love of you know that soulmate

1163
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:19,640
love it turns into a deeper love where

1164
00:46:18,119 --> 00:46:21,880
the adrenaline's aren't the adrenals

1165
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:23,839
aren't surging to that degree anymore

1166
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:26,000
but falling in love at the very first

1167
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:28,040
time that's when a lot of people come

1168
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,960
down with mono that's when a lot of

1169
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:31,520
people come down with mono they fall in

1170
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:33,839
love for the first time and they they're

1171
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:35,480
up all night in love and they're they're

1172
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:36,280
spending time with that person that

1173
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:38,440
they're in love with and they're

1174
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:40,119
thinking about the person 24 day 24

1175
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:42,240
hours a day and they're not sleeping for

1176
00:46:40,119 --> 00:46:43,760
those first few weeks and and all the

1177
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:45,160
adrenaline is pumping and surging

1178
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:46,559
through their body and hormones is

1179
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:48,319
surging through their body and they come

1180
00:46:46,559 --> 00:46:50,680
down with mono or the worst strep threat

1181
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:54,000
they've ever had that happens for 70% of

1182
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:58,319
the people that fall in love and but at

1183
00:46:54,000 --> 00:47:00,839
the same time that causes a deficiency

1184
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:04,280
falling in love causes a physical

1185
00:47:00,839 --> 00:47:06,240
deficiency even though it helps heal the

1186
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:09,640
soul too you know it's healing for the

1187
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:11,160
soul it's a it causes a deficiency so

1188
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:12,680
that's why you got to make sure the

1189
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:14,240
fruits and vegetables and everything we

1190
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:16,480
talk about are in there the herbs

1191
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:18,160
everything are in there no matter what's

1192
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:20,480
going on and then it's not just falling

1193
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:22,040
in love it's falling out of love meaning

1194
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:23,640
something happening in a relationship

1195
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:25,200
that takes the toll the worst that's

1196
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:26,839
much worse that's when the stress comes

1197
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:28,359
on that's when the hardship comes on

1198
00:47:26,839 --> 00:47:30,119
that's when the Heartbreak comes on and

1199
00:47:28,359 --> 00:47:32,400
that really breaks down the immune

1200
00:47:30,119 --> 00:47:34,240
system the divorces and everything else

1201
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:35,559
we just life goes through and people go

1202
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:38,760
through we all go through whatever

1203
00:47:35,559 --> 00:47:40,760
happens in life and and that takes a

1204
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:43,000
toll and guess what suffers from it the

1205
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:45,760
nails they get paper thin brittle and

1206
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:48,559
beaten down the liver gets beaten down

1207
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:51,319
so we got to restore we have to restore

1208
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:53,240
and it's not Protein that's the answer

1209
00:47:51,319 --> 00:47:55,440
your nails are falling apart it's

1210
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:58,160
minerals it's vitamins it's not protein

1211
00:47:55,440 --> 00:48:00,040
it's minerals and its vitamins and

1212
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:02,240
that's the key always remember that so

1213
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:04,440
those nails are falling apart you want

1214
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:06,200
to make sure you got the zinc the

1215
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:08,240
selenium I would get the selenium

1216
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:10,680
supplement I would get the manganese

1217
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:12,880
supplement okay so manganese ionic

1218
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:14,640
manganese check out you know check it

00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:19,440
with citric acid one with poison in it

1222
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:22,440
one that's just broken down all the

1223
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:24,760
wrong way but you the manganese okay the

1224
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:26,839
malinam hey I said that right today

1225
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:28,599
malinam that's tongue twister look at

1226
00:48:26,839 --> 00:48:30,880
look at the word and say that one that's

1227
00:48:28,599 --> 00:48:33,559
such tongue twister it's not even funny

1228
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:36,640
miminum selenium

1229
00:48:33,559 --> 00:48:38,400
manganese okay um and and zinc zinc's

1230
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:41,079
the big one make sure you bring these in

1231
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:42,760
do a little bit of this for a month and

1232
00:48:41,079 --> 00:48:44,520
what's going to happen is your nails are

1233
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:46,280
going to get better bring in the silica

1234
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:47,920
too bring in the silica silica is not

1235
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:50,760
straight protein it's not that's not

1236
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:53,000
what it is bring in the silica see and

1237
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:54,720
the nails start getting better eat more

1238
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,280
fruits and vegetables cleanse the liver

1239
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:57,880
get the liver stronger stronger and your

1240
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:59,880
nails will start getting better

1241
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:02,040
spirulina has protein in it but it's the

1242
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:05,040
keres and the spirulina that get the

1243
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:08,280
skin better very

1244
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:10,240
important very important the ashwagandha

1245
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:13,079
gets the adrenal stronger that's why

1246
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:14,920
hair grows back with ashwagandha that's

1247
00:49:13,079 --> 00:49:16,760
another thing that really helps the more

1248
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:18,920
you cleanse your liver though and clean

1249
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:21,720
it up and don't hamper it down with too

1250
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:24,520
many animal fats or if you're vegetarian

1251
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:28,480
or vegan too much plant protein that's

1252
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:30,799
powdered or you know or in you know gobs

1253
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:32,880
of empty plant protein that's thrown in

1254
00:49:30,799 --> 00:49:34,480
packages because vegans feel that

1255
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:37,319
they're in fear that they better keep up

1256
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:39,599
with protein that could wear down the

1257
00:49:37,319 --> 00:49:41,680
liver right so you see what I'm saying

1258
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:44,480
so I'm giving you everything I got and

1259
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:49,200
I'm not picking on one particular diet

1260
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:51,200
I'm in it for you I'm in it for you okay

1261
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:53,640
and you're doing your part if you try

1262
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:56,119
one little thing and that makes me have

1263
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:58,079
to do my part over here cuz cuz I got to

1264
00:49:56,119 --> 00:50:02,559
do it if I don't do my part then what

1265
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:04,760
the heck got to do my part you guys um

1266
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:06,520
okay all right so the Omega-3s I talked

1267
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:09,119
about earlier look for an omega-3 fish

1268
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:11,240
oil isn't the omega-3 of choice that you

1269
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:13,359
want for Hair Skin and Nails you want

1270
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:15,040
the plant-based even if you're paleo if

1271
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:18,079
you're paleo even if you're eating

1272
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:19,559
salmon it's the oils that they put

1273
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:21,160
together in krill and fish oil they are

1274
00:50:19,559 --> 00:50:23,280
so highly concentrated that there's a

1275
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:24,720
level of methyl mercury in them even the

1276
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:27,000
Mercury free ones that claim they're

1277
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:29,240
Mercury free they're not Mercury free I

1278
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:32,599
promise you they're not Mercury free you

1279
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:34,680
want the plant-based omega-3 oils check

1280
00:50:32,599 --> 00:50:36,720
out my information in fish oil and my

1281
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:37,559
books and all that okay you know learn

1282
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:41,720
from

1283
00:50:37,559 --> 00:50:44,400
that and um so that's another great

1284
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:45,760
thing too so all these vitamins these

1285
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:48,079
minerals that I'm talking about these

1286
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:51,280
nutrients and these herbs help

1287
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:54,319
peppermint is a powerful liver res

1288
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:58,720
restorative peppermint peppermint tees

1289
00:50:54,319 --> 00:51:01,599
do lots of herbal pepper mes oregano oil

1290
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:03,760
which kills bacteria and viruses does

1291
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:06,440
really good though for the liver because

1292
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:09,480
it lowers the viral and bacterial load

1293
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:12,640
in the liver that that bogs down the

1294
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:16,160
liver olive leaf lowers the bacterial

1295
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:18,599
and and and um viral level in the liver

1296
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:20,319
so those are good too and then like I

1297
00:51:18,599 --> 00:51:21,880
said the Melissa the lemon bomb that's

1298
00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:24,280
amazing for a whole bunch of different

1299
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:28,200
reasons as well um so we're coming we're

1300
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:31,280
coming to the end of this so the liver

1301
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:33,680
is responsible for so much and it's not

1302
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:35,319
a liver show but it's responsible for so

1303
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:37,559
much with hair skin and Nails the

1304
00:51:35,319 --> 00:51:39,839
adrenals are responsible for with hair

1305
00:51:37,559 --> 00:51:42,040
skin and nails when we get sick and our

1306
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:43,720
immune systems break down and epine bars

1307
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:46,400
and all kinds of other viruses and and

1308
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:48,559
bacteria also proliferate and they grow

1309
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:51,480
and they they start to consume us in a

1310
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:53,559
way they release a lot of toxins and a

1311
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:55,040
lot of neurotoxins the body has to use

1312
00:51:53,559 --> 00:51:56,119
all its reserves and vitamins and

1313
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:59,000
minerals

1314
00:51:56,119 --> 00:52:01,760
to to to to clean that up and and fight

1315
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:03,640
for us so all these things do matter but

1316
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:05,240
remember the foods if you can't do

1317
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:06,799
supplements for some reason and you're

1318
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:09,040
