[0.16 - 3.28] live on youtube making the spinach soup
[2.96 - 5.20] a
[3.28 - 7.12] powerful healing tool from the medical
[5.20 - 8.96] medium new edition
[7.12 - 10.32] now you might be thinking i don't need
[8.96 - 11.92] any spinach soup
[10.32 - 14.16] doesn't sound that fun doesn't sound
[11.92 - 17.28] that great but it's one of the most
[14.16 - 19.76] powerful tools in the bunch of tools
[17.28 - 21.92] and it's helped a lot of people heal and
[19.76 - 23.04] i'm going to cover why it's important so
[21.92 - 24.96] in a little bit i'm going to talk about
[23.04 - 26.88] the stomach and what the spinach soup
[24.96 - 27.36] does in your stomach how your stomach
[26.88 - 29.60] lands
[27.36 - 31.44] have to recover and repair so you can
[29.60 - 33.44] have hydrochloric acid so you can break
[31.44 - 36.40] down digest your proteins
[33.44 - 37.84] have good digestive system good good gut
[36.40 - 40.88] health austin good to see you
[37.84 - 42.16] glad we're on here also talking about
[40.88 - 44.72] science a little bit
[42.16 - 46.96] science says if science says then hey
[44.72 - 50.24] we're supposed to believe it right
[46.96 - 51.20] um pia hi from the uk great glad you're
[50.24 - 54.00] here i'm honored
[51.20 - 55.12] fantastic good to see you guys coming on
[54.00 - 57.92] um so
[55.12 - 60.40] spinach soup is something that is really
[57.92 - 62.72] healing on the intestinal lining
[60.40 - 63.92] it's healing for the brain it's an
[62.72 - 67.28] important
[63.92 - 69.04] important uh basically recipe if you
[67.28 - 70.40] want to call it i call it a healing tool
[69.04 - 73.36] for the brain
[70.40 - 74.40] mineral salts electrolytes these things
[73.36 - 77.84] are critical
[74.40 - 81.60] so and someone's got the brain fog
[77.84 - 84.64] someone has bloating cramping
[81.60 - 84.88] digestive problems and a lot of people
[84.64 - 86.96] have
[84.88 - 88.32] ammonia that builds up in their gut and
[86.96 - 88.88] builds up in their gut and builds up
[88.32 - 90.88] their guts
[88.88 - 92.88] causes more and more trouble and that
[90.88 - 95.20] ammonia can seep into the mouth and
[92.88 - 98.24] people get the bad breath
[95.20 - 99.36] proteins and fats rot in the in the
[98.24 - 103.04] digestive
[99.36 - 104.16] cavity right and people get in trouble
[103.04 - 105.52] so the spinach soup is one of these
[104.16 - 106.80] healing tools what i like about the
[105.52 - 108.24] spinach soup is people that have
[106.80 - 113.28] fibromyalgia
[108.24 - 116.88] cfs the brain fog anxiety depression
[113.28 - 119.12] uh anything like gout i mean any kind of
[116.88 - 120.32] condition really the spinach soup is
[119.12 - 121.76] really powerful it's
[120.32 - 123.04] people with kidney disease kidney
[121.76 - 123.92] problems i love the spinach soup for
[123.04 - 126.40] that too
[123.92 - 128.56] very healing so uh anyway guys great
[126.40 - 129.20] mandy says is there any good guides for
[128.56 - 132.56] people with
[129.20 - 135.60] mthfr problems um well
[132.56 - 137.12] the books have that information so liver
[135.60 - 139.92] rescue talks about
[137.12 - 141.28] mthfr gene mutation right here so you
[139.92 - 143.20] can learn about it
[141.28 - 144.64] and all the books the medical media
[143.20 - 145.92] books talk about that we'll talk about
[144.64 - 147.44] that in cleansing heal here's a great
[145.92 - 149.92] one too
[147.44 - 150.96] so you can learn about that and the sad
[149.92 - 154.84] thing is
[150.96 - 156.08] is that with the mthf mthfr gene
[154.84 - 158.48] mutation
[156.08 - 161.04] uh diagnoses what people don't realize
[158.48 - 163.52] it's there's no gene mutation so
[161.04 - 164.96] we get tricked we get full we get duped
[163.52 - 167.44] that's how it's done
[164.96 - 169.92] so that test when you when you get the
[167.44 - 171.20] mthfr gene mutation test that's just an
[169.92 - 175.12] inflammatory marker
[171.20 - 177.92] they actually don't find a gene that's
[175.12 - 178.56] mutated so it's it's important to know
[177.92 - 180.96] that
[178.56 - 182.24] so i mean if you want to know if you
[180.96 - 183.84] need to
[182.24 - 186.88] and i try to tell this to anybody if you
[183.84 - 188.80] need to believe you have a gene mutation
[186.88 - 190.88] and that's something that feels good
[188.80 - 192.80] like hey that's my problem
[190.88 - 195.20] that's why i'm sick that's why i have a
[192.80 - 197.68] problem if that's what you need
[195.20 - 199.04] to sleep at night then then that's okay
[197.68 - 201.36] let it be a gene mutation
[199.04 - 202.56] all right but if you're if you're
[201.36 - 204.00] looking for
[202.56 - 206.00] an answer if you're looking for the
[204.00 - 207.84] truth if you're looking for
[206.00 - 209.76] really fixing these problems you'll
[207.84 - 210.64] learn from medical medium information
[209.76 - 212.48] which
[210.64 - 213.68] is information it's teaching doctors all
[212.48 - 215.36] around the world
[213.68 - 217.28] you'll learn that the gene mutation
[215.36 - 220.56] isn't really what it is
[217.28 - 221.36] that's why okay when people get rid of
[220.56 - 223.28] their inf
[221.36 - 224.48] inflammation and they're doing medical
[223.28 - 225.76] medium information they're getting rid
[224.48 - 226.72] of that inflammation and they're doing
[225.76 - 229.20] medical medium
[226.72 - 231.44] information right what happens is their
[229.20 - 233.84] gene mutation goes away
[231.44 - 235.12] it disappears so now they're at their
[233.84 - 236.24] doctor's office whatever they get the
[235.12 - 239.12] blood work
[236.24 - 240.72] and the results come back and it's like
[239.12 - 242.80] um
[240.72 - 244.48] your gene mutation and we don't know how
[242.80 - 245.60] this happened but your gene mutation
[244.48 - 248.64] went away
[245.60 - 250.40] it's gone and medical medium
[248.64 - 252.00] people people who are doing medical
[250.40 - 253.52] medium information learning how to heal
[252.00 - 255.76] through the book's information
[253.52 - 257.20] they hear this all the time i've been
[255.76 - 260.16] hearing this for years
[257.20 - 260.88] so even before the publication of this
[260.16 - 262.32] this first
[260.88 - 263.68] book this is the new edition right here
[262.32 - 265.84] but the publication of the first book
[263.68 - 268.56] with mthfr gene mutation
[265.84 - 270.08] the test was always just an inflammatory
[268.56 - 272.24] marker but you're going to be
[270.08 - 273.84] misled and you're going to be led to
[272.24 - 275.20] believe that you actually have a gene
[273.84 - 277.60] mutation they're like oh my god
[275.20 - 278.88] my son has a gene mutation my daughter
[277.60 - 281.68] has a gene mutation
[278.88 - 282.88] my mom has a gene mutation and that's
[281.68 - 284.32] what you're gonna be told right
[282.88 - 286.08] so you're gonna be thinking all that so
[284.32 - 287.52] now you're walking around like wow my
[286.08 - 290.72] genes are messed up
[287.52 - 293.52] i got you know a messed up gene
[290.72 - 295.76] i got a gene that's like denatured i got
[293.52 - 296.00] a gene that mutated you know it's like
[295.76 - 298.08] my
[296.00 - 299.60] g mutated you see how what a screw up
[298.08 - 302.88] this is in the industry
[299.60 - 305.20] and so but really what it is
[302.88 - 306.00] it's like a c-reactive protein test it's
[305.20 - 308.00] like in
[306.00 - 310.32] an anti-nuclear antigen test it's like
[308.00 - 311.52] it's a psa test it's it's it's an
[310.32 - 314.16] inflammation marker
[311.52 - 315.52] that's all it is for some reason
[314.16 - 318.72] pseudoscience
[315.52 - 319.60] pseudoscience slipped in the door on
[318.72 - 322.16] that one
[319.60 - 323.04] and made that one made everybody think
[322.16 - 326.64] that you
[323.04 - 329.92] have a gene that mutated
[326.64 - 333.92] see the big mistake right there and so
[329.92 - 337.28] and genes that mutate don't ever
[333.92 - 339.60] research in science don't ever change
[337.28 - 340.56] that means you have this mutated gene
[339.60 - 344.00] forever
[340.56 - 347.12] for for a lifetime right then why
[344.00 - 351.20] does everybody's gene mutations go
[347.12 - 352.40] away the mth mthfr gene mutation go away
[351.20 - 353.20] when they're doing medical medium
[352.40 - 354.48] information
[353.20 - 355.92] they're really doing it they're doing
[354.48 - 356.72] their 32 ounces they're doing their
[355.92 - 358.40] spinach soup
[356.72 - 360.56] they're doing their heavy metal detox
[358.40 - 362.88] smoothie right and they're
[360.56 - 365.20] you're doing all these tools and their
[362.88 - 366.64] gene mutation disappears it's not
[365.20 - 369.28] supposed to disappear
[366.64 - 371.28] it can't disappear once you have a
[369.28 - 373.20] mutated gene
[371.28 - 376.16] then that's what you have till the day
[373.20 - 380.16] you die nothing changes that right
[376.16 - 381.68] and because it was never a mutated gene
[380.16 - 383.52] lorraine el says so much trickery the
[381.68 - 385.68] trickery is unbelievable
[383.52 - 387.20] the trickery is unbelievable and to the
[385.68 - 389.76] degree people don't even
[387.20 - 390.64] really realize so you're going to go to
[389.76 - 391.36] the doctor you're going to go to your
[390.64 - 392.64] function medical
[391.36 - 394.48] functional medicine doctor and he's
[392.64 - 396.16] going to draw a whole bunch of blood
[394.48 - 398.16] he only needs this much for your gene
[396.16 - 400.64] mutation test
[398.16 - 402.00] okay you're ready for this all right he
[400.64 - 403.04] only needs that much for your gene
[402.00 - 405.60] mutation test
[403.04 - 406.08] that's all he needs right but he's going
[405.60 - 408.80] to take
[406.08 - 409.76] seven vials out of your daughter and out
[408.80 - 411.84] of your son
[409.76 - 413.04] 14 vials out of your son or daughter
[411.84 - 415.76] okay or
[413.04 - 418.00] he or she's gonna take five seven vials
[415.76 - 419.28] 10 vials 14 vials right
[418.00 - 422.16] and you're going to get all your little
[419.28 - 423.84] tests and they only need that much blood
[422.16 - 425.36] so here they are they weaken your immune
[423.84 - 425.68] system weaken your immune system they
[425.36 - 429.28] take
[425.68 - 432.16] tons of blood tons when it's adding up
[429.28 - 432.96] all the different labs um you should
[432.16 - 434.88] listen to the
[432.96 - 437.52] medical medium podcast at apple podcast
[434.88 - 439.76] and listen to the blood draw episode
[437.52 - 440.72] but there's so much trickery in the
[439.76 - 442.88] system
[440.72 - 444.56] from the blood draw you're losing your
[442.88 - 446.80] immune system during the blood draw
[444.56 - 448.32] okay so they take all your blood so your
[446.80 - 448.96] child children's blood just out the
[448.32 - 452.00] window
[448.96 - 453.44] it's oh your children's blood is it's
[452.00 - 456.08] useless
[453.44 - 456.64] it's disposable your children's blood is
[456.08 - 460.00] just
[456.64 - 460.56] dispensable it's it's just it's not
[460.00 - 462.16] important
[460.56 - 464.16] your the blood in your children is not
[462.16 - 466.32] important you could just remove a ton of
[464.16 - 468.56] it and just get rid of it throw it out
[466.32 - 469.44] the lab only needs this much blab only
[468.56 - 470.96] needs this much
[469.44 - 472.48] but we're going to make sure we take all
[470.96 - 474.40] the blood out of your children
[472.48 - 475.92] that's what the system does okay and
[474.40 - 478.72] they throw it all away
[475.92 - 479.52] like they they train you because science
[478.72 - 481.92] says
[479.52 - 484.56] they train you to believe that your
[481.92 - 486.96] children's blood is disposable
[484.56 - 488.16] disposable that's what they train you to
[486.96 - 490.00] believe
[488.16 - 491.44] it's brainwashing so they brainwash
[490.00 - 495.20] that's what they do
[491.44 - 497.76] that's what they do and
[495.20 - 499.52] i mean i mean it's crazy how it works
[497.76 - 502.72] they the way they do that
[499.52 - 502.72] they want you to believe
[504.80 - 508.24] hold on guys i gotta take the phone call
[508.56 - 516.08] hello yeah this is brainwashed
[512.64 - 517.60] uh yeah this is yeah yeah no i'm
[516.08 - 521.04] brainwashed
[517.60 - 524.56] yes yeah my middle name is brainwashed
[521.04 - 527.60] uh-huh yeah no they taught me that my
[524.56 - 530.32] my children's blood is disposable
[527.60 - 530.80] uh-huh just can throw it away every time
[530.32 - 532.32] yeah
[530.80 - 534.08] no i took them in for a blood work the
[532.32 - 537.76] other day they just took
[534.08 - 538.80] eight vials from my son 12 vials for my
[537.76 - 540.80] daughter
[538.80 - 542.32] they're checking for a g-mutation test
[540.80 - 544.00] and some other things too i forgot what
[542.32 - 546.56] the doctor wanted to do
[544.00 - 547.84] yeah yeah i'm brainwashed uh-huh we're
[546.56 - 551.12] brainwashed
[547.84 - 553.60] yeah yeah what it is yeah
[551.12 - 555.04] no my my children's blood is disposable
[553.60 - 556.40] they taught me that you can just throw
[555.04 - 558.80] it all away
[556.40 - 559.84] just throw all their blood away oh don't
[558.80 - 562.96] worry
[559.84 - 565.12] my children can make new blood oh yeah
[562.96 - 567.20] they're bones their bones can just keep
[565.12 - 570.48] on producing more cbc
[567.20 - 572.32] yeah so the doctor can yeah so they they
[570.48 - 574.72] can the blood lab can vamp it all away
[572.32 - 577.20] and take more and more and more
[574.72 - 578.64] no it's not precious no my children's
[577.20 - 581.44] blood is not precious
[578.64 - 582.32] no not at all they can remove all they
[581.44 - 584.96] want
[582.32 - 585.84] uh-huh 14 20 vials of my children's
[584.96 - 588.32] blood
[585.84 - 590.32] it's not important no no they said it's
[588.32 - 591.44] no big deal just give the child a little
[590.32 - 593.92] juice
[591.44 - 595.12] uh-huh they just said give my daughter a
[593.92 - 597.44] cookie
[595.12 - 598.48] yep give my daughter a cookie that's
[597.44 - 600.72] what they said
[598.48 - 602.32] and they took all this blood for some
[600.72 - 603.84] reason i i guess their blood just
[602.32 - 605.12] doesn't matter much it's not even
[603.84 - 607.60] precious
[605.12 - 608.96] nope ah they can just make new blood all
[607.60 - 610.40] the time oh i accidentally hung up on
[608.96 - 612.80] you are you there
[610.40 - 612.80] you there
[613.68 - 617.76] um anyway the system's broken it's
[616.72 - 620.96] broken
[617.76 - 623.12] broken broken broken back
[620.96 - 625.52] okay when we walk around like it's not
[623.12 - 627.20] broken it's perfect because science says
[625.52 - 628.88] our st the system's not broken it's
[627.20 - 630.00] actually perfect we're brainwashed we're
[628.88 - 632.88] brainwashed
[630.00 - 635.28] science says all right and we're we
[632.88 - 637.04] don't think the system's broken right
[635.28 - 638.48] meanwhile science doesn't know why
[637.04 - 640.08] anybody's sick
[638.48 - 641.52] they just don't know why anybody's sick
[640.08 - 644.08] fibromyalgia they don't know why
[641.52 - 645.60] they think it's overactive nerves right
[644.08 - 647.12] it's chronic fatigue syndrome they don't
[645.60 - 648.72] know why they never did
[647.12 - 650.32] okay multiple sclerosis they still don't
[648.72 - 652.08] know why unless they take
[650.32 - 653.60] medical medium information and publish
[652.08 - 657.12] it which they've done
[653.60 - 659.36] but signs of research in a on a whole
[657.12 - 660.32] doesn't know what what's going on they
[659.36 - 662.16] think it's your genes
[660.32 - 663.76] your body attacking itself or it's maybe
[662.16 - 666.08] hormones maybe
[663.76 - 666.96] they don't know why anybody's sick right
[666.08 - 670.96] so
[666.96 - 672.32] it's kind of the system's so broken
[670.96 - 674.32] and the only way you're gonna even know
[672.32 - 676.56] this is if you've been sick but i get it
[674.32 - 679.20] i get it i get it i get it
[676.56 - 680.08] i get it if you don't know you're sick
[679.20 - 682.64] right
[680.08 - 683.76] you know then then you know here's
[682.64 - 685.44] another thing too this is really
[683.76 - 687.36] important to know you'll see people out
[685.44 - 690.00] there they're not really sick
[687.36 - 691.60] they got little things real little
[690.00 - 692.56] things and that's fine that's great
[691.60 - 695.20] right
[692.56 - 696.56] little things wrong and they go to their
[695.20 - 698.32] doctor and everything and they think
[696.56 - 698.88] they just got it all under control
[698.32 - 700.24] because
[698.88 - 702.40] they're getting rid of some processed
[700.24 - 704.96] food they're taking a few
[702.40 - 706.96] pills a few different things they're
[704.96 - 709.92] taking a couple of supplements
[706.96 - 710.96] and they think that they think they got
[709.92 - 712.48] it going down
[710.96 - 714.88] right they're okay they got it in
[712.48 - 717.44] control and they haven't those
[714.88 - 719.44] people i notice they're just sold on
[717.44 - 722.48] anything science says they're also sold
[719.44 - 724.16] on just you know they're sold on the
[722.48 - 725.52] balance or moderation thing
[724.16 - 727.60] they're sold on a lot of different
[725.52 - 727.92] theories right but the point is is until
[727.60 - 731.20] you
[727.92 - 732.80] get that you cross that line and you're
[731.20 - 735.36] really sick
[732.80 - 737.52] and you're really sick and you're like
[735.36 - 740.08] okay now i'm not functioning
[737.52 - 742.40] my anxiety's crippling you know my pain
[740.08 - 744.56] in my body's hurting really bad
[742.40 - 746.88] now i'm in a place where oh my god this
[744.56 - 750.24] is so difficult what do i do
[746.88 - 750.88] then you realize that science doesn't
[750.24 - 752.48] have it down
[750.88 - 754.48] you got to go searching now and then
[752.48 - 755.04] you're not as now you're at a specialist
[754.48 - 758.08] and now
[755.04 - 759.52] you find out the system is so broken you
[758.08 - 763.44] end up on the doorstep of a
[759.52 - 766.56] mthfrg mutation doctor or a lyme doctor
[763.44 - 768.64] if if if if a doctor is totally into
[766.56 - 769.68] mthfr gene mutation you're going to get
[768.64 - 772.24] that label boom
[769.68 - 773.76] mthfr gene mutation right here here's
[772.24 - 775.28] the factory let's put it on your back
[773.76 - 777.60] right
[775.28 - 778.72] and if you go to a lime doctor boom lime
[777.60 - 780.40] stamp on your back
[778.72 - 782.72] there you go out the door you got lyme
[780.40 - 784.88] disease that's how it's done right
[782.72 - 787.12] or if you go to an ms doctor it's like
[784.88 - 788.80] boom it's ms multiple sclerosis
[787.12 - 790.96] that's your tag you get on your back
[788.80 - 792.40] right and you might get
[790.96 - 794.16] a combination of you might get a
[792.40 - 794.88] doctor's like well could these multiple
[794.16 - 798.32] sclerosis
[794.88 - 799.68] hmm it could be could be lyme disease
[798.32 - 801.20] we're going to take check all that out
[799.68 - 804.24] could be oh you also have the
[801.20 - 805.52] mthfr g mutation too and you get wrapped
[804.24 - 808.48] up into this
[805.52 - 810.32] still no answers but you kind of leave
[808.48 - 811.44] thinking you got some answers like
[810.32 - 813.52] you're getting you're getting a car
[811.44 - 815.84] you're leaving your doctor's office like
[813.52 - 817.36] yeah i think i got some answers they're
[815.84 - 818.72] checking for lyme disease
[817.36 - 820.56] that's what they're doing they're
[818.72 - 821.76] checking for lyme i kind of feel
[820.56 - 823.84] comfortable with that
[821.76 - 825.52] i think i got lyme disease that's an
[823.84 - 827.92] answer i finally got an
[825.52 - 829.68] answer here i'm comfortable with mtf
[827.92 - 831.36] mthfr gene mutation
[829.68 - 832.96] i think i finally got an answer to why
[831.36 - 834.72] i'm fatigued and i'm bloated and don't
[832.96 - 837.76] feel good and i got heart palpitations
[834.72 - 839.28] and i got anxiety yeah yeah it's mthfr
[837.76 - 841.04] gene mutation that's what it is
[839.28 - 842.40] i'm comfortable i'm leaving the doctor's
[841.04 - 845.68] office i'm driving right
[842.40 - 847.60] or hey no oh my god i think it could be
[845.68 - 848.96] multiple sclerosis symptoms but at least
[847.60 - 850.64] i got an answer to why i got the
[848.96 - 851.36] numbness on the side of my body and the
[850.64 - 853.20] tingles
[851.36 - 856.16] and and then all the fatigue and aches
[853.20 - 860.32] and pains and it's supposed to be like
[856.16 - 864.96] you get this answer but the answer
[860.32 - 867.04] in the end means nothing means nothing
[864.96 - 869.04] because you're scammed left and right
[867.04 - 872.72] and this scamming
[869.04 - 873.76] is is it's incidious it's it's actually
[872.72 - 876.96] like incredulous
[873.76 - 880.00] it's the scamming is such a
[876.96 - 881.60] such a smoking mirror and
[880.00 - 883.52] that's that's what's going on out there
[881.60 - 884.48] you know mthfr gene mutation is
[883.52 - 885.84] epstein-barr
[884.48 - 887.52] i'm just going to tell you right now
[885.84 - 889.20] i've seen bar releases all of this
[887.52 - 891.44] poison in your liver right
[889.20 - 892.32] this is mthfrg mutation if you really
[891.44 - 896.32] want to know okay
[892.32 - 899.44] and i wrote this in the books right and
[896.32 - 901.20] that's your liver that's the epstein bar
[899.44 - 903.52] the epson bar hides out in the liver
[901.20 - 904.96] that's where it hides right
[903.52 - 908.24] it hides out in the liver it's peaking
[904.96 - 910.96] its head right there hey guys
[908.24 - 912.16] got the epsilon bar right it likes to
[910.96 - 914.32] hide inside your liver
[912.16 - 915.84] okay i try to make learning fun you guys
[914.32 - 918.32] bear with me right
[915.84 - 919.52] and what it does is it builds up all of
[918.32 - 924.08] this viral
[919.52 - 928.16] toxin byproduct corpses
[924.08 - 931.76] viral byproduct dead viruses
[928.16 - 933.36] right viral casings that end up the
[931.76 - 936.48] casings for what lime
[933.36 - 939.04] lyme doctors believe are spirochetes
[936.48 - 940.08] spirochetes the whole if you guys know
[939.04 - 943.44] anything about lyme disease
[940.08 - 946.88] right well they saw the spirochetes um
[943.44 - 949.04] the doctors saw the spirochete somewhere
[946.88 - 950.40] that's shell casings of the epstein-barr
[949.04 - 952.96] virus
[950.40 - 954.64] that's what that is right so the epstein
[952.96 - 956.88] bar is behind
[954.64 - 958.80] so many of these chronic conditions and
[956.88 - 960.08] with mthfr gene mutation what the
[958.80 - 962.96] epstein bar does
[960.08 - 964.88] it releases all of this gunk and crap it
[962.96 - 967.68] builds up in your liver
[964.88 - 969.76] and then it puffs out of the liver puff
[967.68 - 973.12] powder you ever step on that mushroom
[969.76 - 975.52] that's like it's like uh
[973.12 - 976.72] it's kind of like it looks like a circle
[975.52 - 978.24] and it's on the ground
[976.72 - 980.40] do you ever go into nature and you step
[978.24 - 982.64] on it when you step on it it puffs
[980.40 - 984.16] and what's puffing is all those spores
[982.64 - 985.92] it's a type of it's a type of fungus
[984.16 - 989.04] that grows on the ground right in nature
[985.92 - 992.72] right and that's what happens your liver
[989.04 - 996.08] puffs all of this viral toxin right
[992.72 - 998.24] now you're going to doctor to doctor now
[996.08 - 1001.12] what that's junk does that comes out of
[998.24 - 1004.56] the liver from the epstein-barr virus
[1001.12 - 1006.80] it raises your inflammatory markers
[1004.56 - 1009.12] so it doesn't matter who you're at so
[1006.80 - 1012.56] i'm going to head to the lyme doctor
[1009.12 - 1015.92] the lyme guy well his lyme tests are
[1012.56 - 1018.72] inflammatory markers there's no borrelia
[1015.92 - 1019.68] he finds there's nobody bartonella they
[1018.72 - 1022.00] don't find that
[1019.68 - 1023.36] lyme lab i know i've talked to all kinds
[1022.00 - 1025.44] of lab technicians in
[1023.36 - 1026.48] lime labs and everywhere else right and
[1025.44 - 1028.40] they even reached out to me and they
[1026.48 - 1029.52] said how did you know we don't actually
[1028.40 - 1032.32] have had lime
[1029.52 - 1033.92] lab people reach out to me and say how
[1032.32 - 1036.40] did you know
[1033.92 - 1037.04] because it's private information how did
[1036.40 - 1039.60] you know
[1037.04 - 1041.20] that we don't see the bacteria we place
[1039.60 - 1046.40] the bacteria's name
[1041.20 - 1049.68] on the test we see elevated inflammation
[1046.40 - 1052.40] and then since we're a lime lab we
[1049.68 - 1053.36] put lyme bacteria what we think is
[1052.40 - 1055.68] theoretically
[1053.36 - 1058.08] right there okay now here's the other
[1055.68 - 1060.48] thing mthfr gene mutation
[1058.08 - 1061.92] they're not finding a mutated gene
[1060.48 - 1064.32] doesn't that hurt
[1061.92 - 1067.12] like why are they screwing us over then
[1064.32 - 1068.88] like why isn't the doctor informed
[1067.12 - 1072.08] because they they're just seeing
[1068.88 - 1075.12] elevated inflammation
[1072.08 - 1078.32] just from from the viral issue
[1075.12 - 1079.76] from the viral issue right that's how
[1078.32 - 1081.84] it's done so then you're leaving
[1079.76 - 1083.12] the doctor's office you're driving home
[1081.84 - 1085.52] and you got an answer
[1083.12 - 1086.32] okay me and my kids all got mthfr gene
[1085.52 - 1087.92] mutation
[1086.32 - 1090.40] no you and your kids all got
[1087.92 - 1092.32] epstein-barr
[1090.40 - 1094.16] and maybe it won't matter then until you
[1092.32 - 1096.72] guys get really sick like
[1094.16 - 1097.36] really sick and then that's when it
[1096.72 - 1099.60] matters
[1097.36 - 1101.52] then it's like what the heck is going on
[1099.60 - 1103.76] is my gene mutation out of control like
[1101.52 - 1105.36] what's going on here
[1103.76 - 1107.20] important to know all this is important
[1105.36 - 1108.88] to know
[1107.20 - 1110.56] giving you guys like i'm giving you guys
[1108.88 - 1113.36] information that
[1110.56 - 1114.80] if if if i opened up a school these
[1113.36 - 1115.84] would be courses
[1114.80 - 1117.12] and you'd be paying five thousand
[1115.84 - 1118.64] dollars ten thousand dollars of course
[1117.12 - 1119.76] but i don't do that i want it for i want
[1118.64 - 1121.52] to give it to you for free
[1119.76 - 1123.12] but i know that a lot of people once you
[1121.52 - 1125.52] give everything for free
[1123.12 - 1127.68] they kind of discard it because they
[1125.52 - 1129.68] need to pay for something
[1127.68 - 1130.96] it's interesting how the human i hear i
[1129.68 - 1132.96] keep on hearing this they're like
[1130.96 - 1134.48] aw why aren't you charging thousands of
[1132.96 - 1136.56] dollars for the information
[1134.48 - 1137.92] volumes you give out because then people
[1136.56 - 1139.84] will take you know though maybe they'll
[1137.92 - 1141.12] take it more serious i'm like no no no
[1139.84 - 1143.28] don't insult
[1141.12 - 1144.72] don't insult the people i'm helping
[1143.28 - 1146.16] because they know how serious this
[1144.72 - 1147.68] information is
[1146.16 - 1149.44] and they don't need to pay ten thousand
[1147.68 - 1150.16] dollars for a course to actually know
[1149.44 - 1153.76] how serious
[1150.16 - 1155.44] this is um anyway guys so
[1153.76 - 1156.96] we're covering a lot of cool topics
[1155.44 - 1158.40] right now and it kind of borderlines the
[1156.96 - 1161.60] whole science sets
[1158.40 - 1164.32] okay like science says
[1161.60 - 1167.76] your genes are screwed up science says
[1164.32 - 1167.76] your body's attacking itself
[1167.84 - 1173.44] science says idiopathic
[1171.44 - 1175.44] cause unknown and what i wrote in the
[1173.44 - 1176.96] medical medium book one originally
[1175.44 - 1179.44] basically science is trying to call you
[1176.96 - 1181.12] an idiot you go there with your symptoms
[1179.44 - 1183.04] and the reason why they did the
[1181.12 - 1186.16] idiopathic thing
[1183.04 - 1187.68] really is just because before they came
[1186.16 - 1189.04] came up with the idiopathic thing with
[1187.68 - 1190.16] all your aches and pains and tingles and
[1189.04 - 1192.08] numbness and everything else
[1190.16 - 1193.84] before you what they used to say what
[1192.08 - 1197.04] they used to say is you're crazy
[1193.84 - 1198.88] you know so
[1197.04 - 1200.64] it's really it's really kind of what
[1198.88 - 1203.68] they've always done but
[1200.64 - 1205.76] this information is so it's so um it's
[1203.68 - 1209.04] so incredibly important
[1205.76 - 1210.96] so is is hemochromatosis real gene
[1209.04 - 1212.08] real gene mutation just gas no it's not
[1210.96 - 1214.56] it's viral
[1212.08 - 1216.32] it's viral that's a viral issue right
[1214.56 - 1217.84] see what they need to do is here's what
[1216.32 - 1219.76] science is going to do science is going
[1217.84 - 1222.32] to convince you
[1219.76 - 1224.96] everyone eventually your genes are just
[1222.32 - 1228.40] screwed up it protects science it's that
[1224.96 - 1232.32] it's an incredible way to never
[1228.40 - 1235.04] do science studies on things that matter
[1232.32 - 1235.68] right because they can cast it all as
[1235.04 - 1238.96] jeans
[1235.68 - 1239.92] it's your genes that's it no we don't
[1238.96 - 1242.40] need to take
[1239.92 - 1243.68] 500 billion dollars and put it into why
[1242.40 - 1246.56] your children is
[1243.68 - 1247.52] your child's really sick we don't need
[1246.56 - 1249.92] to do that
[1247.52 - 1251.68] we are going to take 500 billion because
[1249.92 - 1252.80] we got all these grants from massive
[1251.68 - 1254.64] corporations
[1252.80 - 1257.60] we're going to take 500 billion dollars
[1254.64 - 1259.92] and we're going to just study your genes
[1257.60 - 1261.60] that's what they do i'm giving you
[1259.92 - 1264.00] double meaning here
[1261.60 - 1265.52] get ready for this double meaning
[1264.00 - 1267.04] because all medical medium information
[1265.52 - 1267.60] does have hidden double meanings in
[1267.04 - 1271.60] there
[1267.60 - 1274.24] right we're gonna get we're gonna ask
[1271.60 - 1276.24] from big huge corporations so we don't
[1274.24 - 1277.60] have to
[1276.24 - 1280.08] and then we're going to take we're going
[1277.60 - 1282.00] to ask them you give us 250 million
[1280.08 - 1284.16] you give us another medical research we
[1282.00 - 1286.96] want another 250 million
[1284.16 - 1288.88] we want another 500 million from you and
[1286.96 - 1289.44] then we're going to take our 500 billion
[1288.88 - 1291.68] dollars
[1289.44 - 1292.88] and instead of helping children really
[1291.68 - 1294.72] helping moms
[1292.88 - 1296.88] find out why they're fatigued why
[1294.72 - 1298.96] children are sick with eczema
[1296.88 - 1301.52] why people are suffering why children
[1298.96 - 1304.88] have autism why children have adhd
[1301.52 - 1306.56] why all these problems right instead of
[1304.88 - 1309.04] solving any of them we're going to take
[1306.56 - 1312.00] 500 million dollar science
[1309.04 - 1314.72] and we're going to study your genes and
[1312.00 - 1318.24] it ain't for pretty reasons
[1314.72 - 1321.20] it's not for cute fluffy pretty
[1318.24 - 1322.32] reasons and we're gonna study your genes
[1321.20 - 1323.92] never tell you
[1322.32 - 1325.52] never find out what's really wrong with
[1323.92 - 1327.12] you but we're gonna tell you so we can
[1325.52 - 1327.68] say next time you come to the doctor
[1327.12 - 1330.56] we're gonna be
[1327.68 - 1332.56] at your jeans and some of the tricks are
[1330.56 - 1334.80] like the mthfr gene mutation
[1332.56 - 1336.88] all the different genes genie fits your
[1334.80 - 1340.24] jeans jeans jeans
[1336.88 - 1341.36] look you don't have to you don't have to
[1340.24 - 1344.56] like me
[1341.36 - 1348.56] you don't have to like the way i look
[1344.56 - 1351.84] you don't have to like the way i talk
[1348.56 - 1352.64] right but keep an open mind on what i'm
[1351.84 - 1355.36] saying
[1352.64 - 1356.64] because this is really important
[1355.36 - 1357.92] information
[1356.64 - 1359.52] i'm going to make some spinach soup you
[1357.92 - 1362.00] guys got a lot of stuff to talk about
[1359.52 - 1365.12] that's medical medium new addition
[1362.00 - 1367.44] um gene mutation tests
[1365.12 - 1369.12] they don't even need that they don't
[1367.44 - 1372.40] even need that
[1369.12 - 1375.68] forensics forensics
[1372.40 - 1376.32] okay like on a murder scene a murder
[1375.68 - 1379.52] scene
[1376.32 - 1382.64] forensics needs a 30-year
[1379.52 - 1385.12] 40 year old drop of blood on a pair of
[1382.64 - 1388.40] jeans
[1385.12 - 1391.68] okay desiccated blood
[1388.40 - 1393.92] right a pin up
[1391.68 - 1395.68] on the tip of a pin you couldn't even
[1393.92 - 1398.72] see it on here
[1395.68 - 1402.72] on somebody's genes 40 years ago
[1398.72 - 1407.28] to determine dna and other things right
[1402.72 - 1409.28] but they need 14 vials from your baby
[1407.28 - 1411.44] to do a little gene mutation test and
[1409.28 - 1413.76] some nutritional deficiency tests
[1411.44 - 1416.72] and a little bit of cbc they'll take 14
[1413.76 - 1419.60] vials from somebody's baby
[1416.72 - 1420.00] it there's such a break in the system
[1419.60 - 1422.64] it's
[1420.00 - 1423.20] almost it's almost unbelievable you know
[1422.64 - 1426.80] why we
[1423.20 - 1428.32] don't you know why we don't understand
[1426.80 - 1430.32] it
[1428.32 - 1433.84] do you know why we don't get it or
[1430.32 - 1436.88] understand it do you know why
[1433.84 - 1438.40] we can't this
[1436.88 - 1440.88] phone thing's really driving me crazy
[1438.40 - 1444.08] now you guys
[1440.88 - 1446.64] brainwashed huh
[1444.08 - 1447.92] yeah yeah i'm brainwashed uh-huh yeah
[1446.64 - 1451.36] they brainwashed me
[1447.92 - 1454.56] uh-huh yeah they brainwa paddle
[1451.36 - 1455.52] uh-huh i'm part of the paddle what's
[1454.56 - 1458.72] paddle
[1455.52 - 1462.16] that's people that are cattle hurting
[1458.72 - 1464.96] to the brainwashing clinic sheeple
[1462.16 - 1467.60] we're all sheeple then we just heard we
[1464.96 - 1471.36] just heard to the
[1467.60 - 1474.32] we heard to the brainwashing clinic yep
[1471.36 - 1475.68] that's what we do uh-huh we're gonna be
[1474.32 - 1477.76] taught that it's our genes
[1475.68 - 1479.52] but they're gonna take 500 billion more
[1477.76 - 1480.32] dollars and they're going to study our
[1479.52 - 1484.24] genes
[1480.32 - 1487.36] they're never going to tell us huh
[1484.24 - 1488.48] yeah we're brainwashed uh-huh yeah i
[1487.36 - 1492.56] believe them
[1488.48 - 1494.48] i believe them where's your study uh-huh
[1492.56 - 1496.40] yeah where's your study i did they
[1494.48 - 1498.00] trained us to say where's your study
[1496.40 - 1500.08] did you know that when i'm on social
[1498.00 - 1503.52] media brainwashed when i'm on social
[1500.08 - 1506.32] media i type in where's your study
[1503.52 - 1509.36] when i'm on social media i type in
[1506.32 - 1512.40] where's your science report
[1509.36 - 1513.76] yeah we're brainwashed i'm sick i don't
[1512.40 - 1517.36] feel good
[1513.76 - 1519.60] the doctor says it's my genes uh-huh
[1517.36 - 1520.64] they've done it 10 trillion dollars in
[1519.60 - 1522.24] medical testing
[1520.64 - 1523.68] out there in the world and they can't
[1522.24 - 1525.04] even give you anything but it's your
[1523.68 - 1527.28] genes
[1525.04 - 1528.64] uh-huh but i think that's perfectly fine
[1527.28 - 1530.96] because i'm brainwashed
[1528.64 - 1532.00] i gotta go i'm gonna make some spinach
[1530.96 - 1534.64] soup
[1532.00 - 1536.64] make some spinach soup you guys uh
[1534.64 - 1538.32] stephanie what about someone who has
[1536.64 - 1541.36] high histamines
[1538.32 - 1542.08] and a lot of free radicals what causes
[1541.36 - 1545.60] all of this in
[1542.08 - 1548.96] my blood test well first of all
[1545.60 - 1552.24] that's dirty liver that's dirty liver
[1548.96 - 1553.68] it's really simple dirty liver liver
[1552.24 - 1556.08] stagnant and sluggish filled with lots
[1553.68 - 1559.28] of different toxins that's what that is
[1556.08 - 1560.32] histamines elevating means pathogen
[1559.28 - 1563.68] toxins
[1560.32 - 1567.60] streptococcus that's one of them um
[1563.68 - 1570.24] viruses shingles epstein-barr cold sores
[1567.60 - 1571.20] the cold sore virus hides out inside the
[1570.24 - 1573.04] liver
[1571.20 - 1574.32] it's in the liver when you see somebody
[1573.04 - 1576.64] with a cold sore
[1574.32 - 1577.52] you're all you have to you you can learn
[1576.64 - 1580.80] right now
[1577.52 - 1582.72] someone's got a cold sore that virus
[1580.80 - 1584.72] doesn't just live where the cold sore
[1582.72 - 1586.48] comes out in the moment right
[1584.72 - 1588.08] where you can catch it you give them a
[1586.48 - 1589.60] kiss and now you got it
[1588.08 - 1591.04] it could come out a year later it can
[1589.60 - 1591.36] come out a week later but now you got
[1591.04 - 1593.84] the
[1591.36 - 1594.80] the simplex one right that virus lives
[1593.84 - 1596.80] inside the liver
[1594.80 - 1598.24] if you see that on someone it's in the
[1596.80 - 1599.76] liver and
[1598.24 - 1601.36] same thing with shingles it's inside the
[1599.76 - 1605.12] liver same thing with with
[1601.36 - 1608.32] with any bug if you had the chicken pox
[1605.12 - 1612.40] when you were a child the chickenpox
[1608.32 - 1613.92] virus lives inside your liver they live
[1612.40 - 1615.92] in there live in there live in there
[1613.92 - 1617.52] build up all this toxic sludge toxic
[1615.92 - 1617.84] sludge and then the sludge starts coming
[1617.52 - 1619.44] out
[1617.84 - 1621.84] if you got high histamines you'll end up
[1619.44 - 1622.88] getting an mthfr gene mutation diagnosis
[1621.84 - 1625.60] eventually too
[1622.88 - 1628.08] because it's all the same thing it's all
[1625.60 - 1629.36] that gunk coming out of the liver
[1628.08 - 1631.20] then you gotta clean and learn how to
[1629.36 - 1632.80] clean up the liver and lower the fat so
[1631.20 - 1635.76] spinach soup is a great way to do it
[1632.80 - 1638.24] let's go into that a little bit
[1635.76 - 1639.28] um i'm gonna get the cbc off of here
[1638.24 - 1640.80] right
[1639.28 - 1642.32] good to see you guys coming on i want to
[1640.80 - 1645.92] be as helpful as possible
[1642.32 - 1647.52] today that's what i want to do
[1645.92 - 1649.84] oh wow i have the chickenpox at h5
[1647.52 - 1653.04] michelle it sits inside the liver
[1649.84 - 1655.28] doesn't go away it's in everybody
[1653.04 - 1656.88] elena how you doing anthony i used to
[1655.28 - 1660.08] have herpes on my lips
[1656.88 - 1663.12] once in once and a half a year
[1660.08 - 1663.76] or so but after after baby delivery my
[1663.12 - 1666.96] herpes
[1663.76 - 1670.08] moved now i have it on my face
[1666.96 - 1671.60] or inside my nose very painful well what
[1670.08 - 1673.28] happens is that
[1671.60 - 1674.88] when i talk about this many times you
[1673.28 - 1675.92] guys i've talked about this a lot of
[1674.88 - 1679.04] times right
[1675.92 - 1680.24] um the
[1679.04 - 1682.24] i was going to go grab something i don't
[1680.24 - 1684.72] know what it is but it's okay i
[1682.24 - 1687.76] the when when you when you're pregnant
[1684.72 - 1689.92] your immune system drops by 50
[1687.76 - 1693.20] that's what happens so when you're
[1689.92 - 1696.24] pregnant your immune system drops by 50
[1693.20 - 1698.96] for women men's immune system stays
[1696.24 - 1701.44] always even keel they can burn it to the
[1698.96 - 1704.24] ground but it burns to the ground
[1701.44 - 1706.88] evenly it burns to the ground really
[1704.24 - 1709.36] evenly is what it does right
[1706.88 - 1710.72] little women but women's reproductive
[1709.36 - 1713.92] systems
[1710.72 - 1714.80] are different they require the immune
[1713.92 - 1717.84] system to be
[1714.80 - 1720.48] all there so when you're pregnant
[1717.84 - 1721.20] 50 of your immune system protects the
[1720.48 - 1723.44] baby
[1721.20 - 1724.40] when you're pregnant right when you're
[1723.44 - 1727.84] having
[1724.40 - 1729.68] a cycle okay your immune system protects
[1727.84 - 1732.72] your reproductive system too
[1729.68 - 1734.40] when you're delivering the baby 90
[1732.72 - 1736.32] of your entire immune system goes to
[1734.40 - 1739.52] protecting your baby during delivery
[1736.32 - 1741.60] so then that simplex which your immune
[1739.52 - 1744.96] system had under control
[1741.60 - 1746.56] it had that simplex under control right
[1744.96 - 1748.72] your immune system had it totally under
[1746.56 - 1751.04] control and then
[1748.72 - 1752.16] what happened was after being pregnant
[1751.04 - 1755.20] for nine months
[1752.16 - 1756.72] and 50 of your immune system continually
[1755.20 - 1758.40] taking care of the baby
[1756.72 - 1759.92] the immune system wasn't there to keep
[1758.40 - 1763.28] the simplex
[1759.92 - 1766.32] intact like in and keep it cool
[1763.28 - 1768.08] keep it calm keep it in check right
[1766.32 - 1770.08] and then you deliver the baby and now
[1768.08 - 1771.92] the immune system drops because you need
[1770.08 - 1774.64] all your adrenaline to deliver the baby
[1771.92 - 1777.44] now your 90 immune system is taken to
[1774.64 - 1780.88] the baby while your adrenals are pumping
[1777.44 - 1782.56] after after childbirth you can
[1780.88 - 1784.56] women get everything hashimoto's
[1782.56 - 1786.08] thyroiditis from their epstein bars
[1784.56 - 1788.24] they get heart palpitations they get
[1786.08 - 1791.12] arrhythmias from their epstein bars
[1788.24 - 1792.24] they get fatigue from their epstein bars
[1791.12 - 1794.48] they get um
[1792.24 - 1795.44] you know they get herpes cold sores on
[1794.48 - 1798.48] their face
[1795.44 - 1800.56] their nose right on their lips
[1798.48 - 1801.92] from uh from what would they bend
[1800.56 - 1803.52] through they get all these different
[1801.92 - 1804.40] conditions it can happen when the immune
[1803.52 - 1806.88] system
[1804.40 - 1808.32] lowers like that so um but i talk about
[1806.88 - 1809.92] and cleanse the heal all the protocols
[1808.32 - 1813.20] in there you can take it to your doctor
[1809.92 - 1813.20] uh if you want but yeah
[1813.28 - 1819.84] i'm gonna make some spinach soup
[1816.48 - 1822.48] good to see you guys here so
[1819.84 - 1823.76] this spinach soup i love it's so healing
[1822.48 - 1828.32] it's so awesome
[1823.76 - 1830.48] you know and let's do it
[1828.32 - 1832.16] um i'm gonna have a shot of the
[1830.48 - 1835.68] weinman's wild blueberry juice
[1832.16 - 1837.36] because i'm needing a shot right now
[1835.68 - 1839.76] i don't know if you guys got yours yet
[1837.36 - 1842.16] if some of you got got yours yet
[1839.76 - 1842.80] um but i told you i'm working with the
[1842.16 - 1844.56] company
[1842.80 - 1846.00] i'm trying to spread the word about it
[1844.56 - 1847.28] i'm working with them fully gave them an
[1846.00 - 1848.08] official endorsement for me and
[1847.28 - 1849.84] everything
[1848.08 - 1851.60] because i don't want them to stop making
[1849.84 - 1853.28] this i just don't want them to stop
[1851.60 - 1854.24] making this wild blueberry juice because
[1853.28 - 1857.52] i know
[1854.24 - 1860.48] it's a powerful tool and i don't like
[1857.52 - 1860.88] i worry about losing these tools out
[1860.48 - 1862.96] there
[1860.88 - 1864.40] because everybody needs every edge they
[1862.96 - 1866.88] can get you know
[1864.40 - 1868.40] and then wild blueberry is a whole other
[1866.88 - 1870.88] thing i know i talked about it before
[1868.40 - 1870.88] but anyway
[1873.20 - 1878.08] a little refresher there i haven't had a
[1875.44 - 1880.32] shot today usually do it in the morning
[1878.08 - 1881.36] and today i didn't today was one of
[1880.32 - 1882.80] those days
[1881.36 - 1885.76] totally one of those days so let's do
[1882.80 - 1890.56] the spinach soup
[1885.76 - 1890.56] um i'm gonna start by putting in some
[1890.84 - 1894.00] tomatoes
[1892.00 - 1895.04] if you guys don't like tomatoes or you
[1894.00 - 1896.64] know you got a tomato
[1895.04 - 1898.88] like you're just afraid of them or
[1896.64 - 1900.72] something like that you don't have to do
[1898.88 - 1902.48] tomatoes in here and just try to do more
[1900.72 - 1904.08] squeezed oranges if you really want to
[1902.48 - 1906.64] but tomatoes is really a good there's a
[1904.08 - 1909.12] good reason it's in here
[1906.64 - 1911.44] so that's about it right there take a
[1909.12 - 1913.04] few more out just in case i got too many
[1911.44 - 1914.32] and i'm going to put a little cilantro
[1913.04 - 1916.48] in here too you don't have to put a lot
[1914.32 - 1918.88] but i'm going to put some
[1916.48 - 1921.84] makes a great chop up one celery stick
[1918.88 - 1921.84] you can do that
[1922.64 - 1926.24] i'm chopping up a celery stick it's a
[1924.56 - 1929.68] big it's a pretty big celery
[1926.24 - 1931.92] stick too okay
[1929.68 - 1933.52] doing that too it's good to see you guys
[1931.92 - 1935.76] i'm glad you're here
[1933.52 - 1937.52] can you heat the spinach soup please
[1935.76 - 1939.52] that's a different kind of spinach soup
[1937.52 - 1942.16] this is a raw spinach soup
[1939.52 - 1943.60] it's it's so delicious have you tried it
[1942.16 - 1947.20] that's so good i mean
[1943.60 - 1948.08] so good so i'm gonna put some spinach in
[1947.20 - 1949.52] here too
[1948.08 - 1951.60] let's let's get a garlic clove in here
[1949.52 - 1954.08] i'm putting a little one okay
[1951.60 - 1954.96] little one in here just letting you guys
[1954.08 - 1956.48] know
[1954.96 - 1958.24] if you guys came on here we're talking
[1956.48 - 1962.16] about some powerful
[1958.24 - 1964.32] topics talking about
[1962.16 - 1965.84] science how broken it is when it comes
[1964.32 - 1968.80] to chronic illness it's so
[1965.84 - 1970.48] sad it's so broken um if you're
[1968.80 - 1972.16] sensitive leave the garlic out if you
[1970.48 - 1973.92] want if you don't like garlic or you're
[1972.16 - 1975.20] sensitive about it right
[1973.92 - 1977.04] but i'm using a tiny bit if you're
[1975.20 - 1980.64] sensitive put a tiny bit in
[1977.04 - 1982.16] okay ashley kevin just said she adores
[1980.64 - 1984.00] the spinach soup
[1982.16 - 1985.76] incredible so i'm gonna put some spinach
[1984.00 - 1987.52] in here now
[1985.76 - 1989.44] what i like to do is this is a smaller
[1987.52 - 1992.00] blender blender it's not
[1989.44 - 1994.16] it's not a real tall one so i'm gonna
[1992.00 - 1997.36] add more spinach after i blend it up you
[1994.16 - 1997.36] guys after i blend it up
[1997.60 - 2001.12] you can do look you can steam spinach if
[2000.00 - 2004.16] you really wanted to
[2001.12 - 2006.16] i don't like it that i honestly i like
[2004.16 - 2007.60] the raw spinach so healing for the
[2006.16 - 2010.72] mineral salts
[2007.60 - 2013.44] andrea when when i would eat raw soups
[2010.72 - 2015.28] like this my acid reflux kicks up
[2013.44 - 2016.56] is this liver and gallbladder being
[2015.28 - 2019.76] sluggish
[2016.56 - 2020.80] um first of all okay first for being
[2019.76 - 2023.44] your own detective
[2020.80 - 2024.96] one thing you want to do is make sure
[2023.44 - 2028.00] were there any fats
[2024.96 - 2029.20] in that raw soup were there avocado in
[2028.00 - 2031.76] that raw soup
[2029.20 - 2033.12] was there any oil in that raw soup first
[2031.76 - 2034.24] of all i mean maybe there wasn't and
[2033.12 - 2036.88] there wasn't any of that
[2034.24 - 2038.72] okay andrea was there any nutritional
[2036.88 - 2040.64] yeast in the diet was there any
[2038.72 - 2042.32] vinegar apple cider vinegar in there a
[2040.64 - 2043.44] lot of raw people they're just raw raw
[2042.32 - 2044.96] and they're just doing apple cider
[2043.44 - 2046.88] vinegar or whatever it is
[2044.96 - 2048.96] make sure that's not going anywhere near
[2046.88 - 2050.16] there so that's important all on its own
[2048.96 - 2052.32] okay
[2050.16 - 2054.40] and then what did you eat before the
[2052.32 - 2056.08] spinach soup what did you have
[2054.40 - 2057.68] during did you do the spinach soup or
[2056.08 - 2059.60] dinner but you had a lot of
[2057.68 - 2061.44] fat and you pushed your gallbladder to
[2059.60 - 2063.28] the edge during the day
[2061.44 - 2064.96] like did you have you know are you
[2063.28 - 2066.56] plant-based and you had some nut butters
[2064.96 - 2067.84] that day and then you had some avocado
[2066.56 - 2071.36] that day and you had maybe
[2067.84 - 2073.20] coconut oil that day um so that's that
[2071.36 - 2075.36] all these things are important to know
[2073.20 - 2076.96] and then how much spinach soup you know
[2075.36 - 2079.12] sometimes you know you make a big bowl
[2076.96 - 2081.04] of it and you send it down really quick
[2079.12 - 2082.80] it's really a potent healing tool so you
[2081.04 - 2085.20] kind of sip it and just kind of get
[2082.80 - 2088.80] through and see how that's working too
[2085.20 - 2090.64] it and acid reflux this is the only time
[2088.80 - 2093.92] you ever had acid reflux
[2090.64 - 2094.80] this is it this this is just it like no
[2093.92 - 2096.96] acid reflux
[2094.80 - 2098.48] on anything you can eat all week do
[2096.96 - 2099.92] everything all week every day
[2098.48 - 2101.92] every day all week you're doing
[2099.92 - 2103.60] everything and no acid reflux and then
[2101.92 - 2105.36] the spinach soup did it
[2103.60 - 2107.60] so keep keep that in mind too you
[2105.36 - 2109.84] probably had some acid reflux
[2107.60 - 2111.92] constantly coming in and out of there so
[2109.84 - 2115.28] the spinach soup is a healing tool
[2111.92 - 2118.64] so now here's here's the next part
[2115.28 - 2120.80] this this starves bad bacteria
[2118.64 - 2122.48] so that's what this does so the medical
[2120.80 - 2126.16] means spinach soup
[2122.48 - 2128.88] starves bad bacteria
[2126.16 - 2130.08] so you know what that means but really
[2128.88 - 2133.44] starves them
[2130.08 - 2136.56] strips them down breaks them down
[2133.44 - 2137.04] okay so when you're and here's the other
[2136.56 - 2140.64] thing
[2137.04 - 2142.72] okay oh you got acid you got acid reflux
[2140.64 - 2144.80] all the time andrea
[2142.72 - 2147.44] so there's acid if you have acid reflux
[2144.80 - 2149.92] you got the low hydrochloric acid
[2147.44 - 2151.20] you got that going on right so there's
[2149.92 - 2153.12] the low hcl
[2151.20 - 2154.32] got some bacteria going i tell people
[2153.12 - 2155.44] all the time i talk to doctors about
[2154.32 - 2157.68] this all the time too
[2155.44 - 2160.48] their patients they have this they have
[2157.68 - 2162.72] the elevated bacteria in their gut right
[2160.48 - 2164.32] and that's producing acid then they got
[2162.72 - 2165.84] the stagnant sluggish liver that's
[2164.32 - 2167.68] spewing out stuff
[2165.84 - 2169.04] then the gallbladder spewing out all
[2167.68 - 2170.72] kinds of stuff too
[2169.04 - 2172.64] and the spinach soup's like the cleaner
[2170.72 - 2174.40] upper it gets in there man it is
[2172.64 - 2176.00] cleaning all this stuff up
[2174.40 - 2177.52] i mean it's a healing tool that's doing
[2176.00 - 2180.64] all this cleaning so that's
[2177.52 - 2184.88] that happens right there um
[2180.64 - 2187.12] let's put some orange in here okay
[2184.88 - 2188.40] i think uh every time i do this on
[2187.12 - 2190.08] youtube and face i'm

[2251.92 - 2255.04] sensitivity
[2252.64 - 2256.72] or what was it just practitioners said
[2255.04 - 2258.96] you're sensitive to spinach
[2256.72 - 2259.92] you're sensitive to this nut you're
[2258.96 - 2261.76] sensitive to
[2259.92 - 2263.04] this you're sensitive to cilantro
[2261.76 - 2264.72] sensitive to strawberries
[2263.04 - 2266.00] sensitive to this sensitive to that
[2264.72 - 2268.08] sensitive to this oh and you're
[2266.00 - 2268.80] sensitive to spinach too is it that kind
[2268.08 - 2270.80] of thing right
[2268.80 - 2272.32] i want you to be your own detective okay
[2270.80 - 2274.08] or is it like you eat it
[2272.32 - 2276.40] and something goes funny which could
[2274.08 - 2278.48] happen i mean i mean it could just for
[2276.40 - 2280.00] anybody i mean people eat things they're
[2278.48 - 2281.68] like hey i got this funny thing that
[2280.00 - 2283.04] happens when i eat a piece of meat or i
[2281.68 - 2284.00] got this funny thing that happens when i
[2283.04 - 2286.96] eat a piece of pork
[2284.00 - 2288.64] or or want to eat a leaf of lettuce
[2286.96 - 2289.36] right people have these funny things
[2288.64 - 2292.48] that happen
[2289.36 - 2294.88] right but what is it going on like so if
[2292.48 - 2297.60] if it's not something happening when you
[2294.88 - 2300.32] go and you eat that piece of spinach
[2297.60 - 2302.32] and it's just someone said hey this is
[2300.32 - 2304.96] what comes up
[2302.32 - 2305.84] if it was me i'd still be doing it
[2304.96 - 2308.00] because
[2305.84 - 2309.36] food sensitivity tests don't don't
[2308.00 - 2311.12] really give the full picture about
[2309.36 - 2312.72] really what's happening inside the body
[2311.12 - 2315.76] and here's the thing this is important
[2312.72 - 2319.28] too this is really important right here
[2315.76 - 2321.44] critical how is it possible
[2319.28 - 2322.80] everybody's a guru everybody's giving
[2321.44 - 2325.60] out all kinds of advice
[2322.80 - 2326.88] both medical whether it's naturopaths
[2325.60 - 2328.56] functional medicine doctors

[2328.56 - 2333.12] nutritionist dietitians
[2330.32 - 2334.96] plain old coaches anybody trainers you
[2333.12 - 2336.80] name it everybody's such an expert when
[2334.96 - 2338.88] nobody knows why anybody's sick
[2336.80 - 2341.20] it's incredible right think about that
[2338.88 - 2342.64] so food sensitivities all got it down
[2341.20 - 2343.92] but the food sensitivity doctor don't
[2342.64 - 2345.36] know why anybody has chronic fatigue
[2343.92 - 2347.52] syndrome multiple sclerosis
[2345.36 - 2348.64] als they don't know anything they don't
[2347.52 - 2349.92] know why somebody has alzheimer's
[2348.64 - 2353.28] dementia
[2349.92 - 2354.80] anxiety depression right the same thing
[2353.28 - 2356.00] with nutritious nutritionists will give
[2354.80 - 2358.16] you all this great advice
[2356.00 - 2359.44] but they don't know why you got lupus
[2358.16 - 2360.56] lyme disease they don't know why you
[2359.44 - 2363.20] have anything
[2360.56 - 2364.32] tingles aches and pains tinnitus vertigo

[2608.96 - 2612.72] and getting better after 40 years of
[2610.72 - 2613.36] dealing with ebv the issues what happens
[2612.72 - 2616.00] is
[2613.36 - 2617.68] what i'm saying to julia julia before
[2616.00 - 2618.88] medical medium information you just
[2617.68 - 2621.20] stayed sick
[2618.88 - 2622.00] for 40 years people just stayed sick
[2621.20 - 2624.32] that's what they do
[2622.00 - 2625.28] you get sick you stay sick hashimoto's
[2624.32 - 2627.28] never heals
[2625.28 - 2628.64] nothing ever heals you just stayed sick
[2627.28 - 2630.16] with fibro stayed sick with multiple
[2628.64 - 2631.76] sclerosis that's what people did
[2630.16 - 2634.08] before medical medium information came
[2631.76 - 2635.36] to town foley came to town it was
[2634.08 - 2636.48] already out there and i was already
[2635.36 - 2638.96] getting people better
[2636.48 - 2640.88] but when it really came to town millions
[2638.96 - 2643.12] more millions around the world healed
[2640.88 - 2645.92] but the point is is i'm not trying to
[2643.12 - 2649.20] boast i'm just answering the question
[2645.92 - 2650.80] that why should i listen to him
[2649.20 - 2653.04] and you know what i tell people don't
[2650.80 - 2653.52] listen to me you don't have to listen to
[2653.04 - 2656.40] me
[2653.52 - 2657.92] don't don't go where you want do what
[2656.40 - 2660.24] you want and when you get so
[2657.92 - 2677.76] sick and you're tired of being so sick
[2660.24 - 2679.12] this maybe you'll actually do the stuff
[2677.76 - 2681.28] i'm going to add some more spinach in
[2679.12 - 2681.28] here
[2685.28 - 2690.88] lauren says julie joseph i follow
[2688.72 - 2691.20] medical medium and everything he says to
[2690.88 - 2693.92] do
[2691.20 - 2694.72] but recently my organic assets test
[2693.92 - 2697.92] showed
[2694.72 - 2699.76] oxalates getting high causing pain
[2697.92 - 2701.44] so first of all the oxalate thing and
[2699.76 - 2702.08] look i want you to listen to your doctor
[2701.44 - 2704.56] lauren
[2702.08 - 2705.84] you do what your doctor says okay you
[2704.56 - 2707.68] listen to your doctor
[2705.84 - 2710.24] the doctor says it's oxalates listen to
[2707.68 - 2713.92] your doctor okay
[2710.24 - 2713.92] but i'll tell you what i teach doctors
[2714.32 - 2717.44] the old oxalate game isn't why anybody
[2716.40 - 2718.88] was sick
[2717.44 - 2720.00] people played with oxalates till the
[2718.88 - 2721.60] blue they were blue in the face and
[2720.00 - 2724.16] never got rid of their fibro or anything
[2721.60 - 2726.64] else oxalates is also a theory
[2724.16 - 2729.84] science research hasn't even actually
[2726.64 - 2732.00] proven oxalates is an issue
[2729.84 - 2733.76] so your doctor is not even working with
[2732.00 - 2735.92] something that was proven yet
[2733.76 - 2737.20] so okay is your doctor making up the
[2735.92 - 2738.80] oxalates thing
[2737.20 - 2740.88] because if he is you're talking to
[2738.80 - 2743.12] somebody that's making stuff up right
[2740.88 - 2744.48] so because oxalates can't be proven
[2743.12 - 2746.72] science research never found
[2744.48 - 2748.08] oxalates in the body causing any problem
[2746.72 - 2749.60] there's never been anything that ever
[2748.08 - 2752.80] showed that right
[2749.60 - 2754.40] but and here's how oxalates work
[2752.80 - 2756.16] people go on the oxalate train and they
[2754.40 - 2759.28] go searching for oxalates
[2756.16 - 2760.72] and people don't realize you can call it
[2759.28 - 2762.08] oxalates you can call it anything you
[2760.72 - 2763.04] want but what else is happening in your
[2762.08 - 2764.40] life
[2763.04 - 2765.68] what else are you doing are you doing
[2764.40 - 2768.00] nutritional yeast are you doing apple
[2765.68 - 2769.84] cider vinegar are you doing any caffeine
[2768.00 - 2771.36] or did you have chocolate two weeks ago
[2769.84 - 2773.76] because that causes body pain
[2771.36 - 2775.12] caffeine so there's there's all these
[2773.76 - 2776.72] things that people do
[2775.12 - 2778.40] and so i want you to be your own
[2776.72 - 2779.84] detective right i want you to listen to
[2778.40 - 2780.80] everything your doctor says lauren i
[2779.84 - 2782.40] want you to listen everything your
[2780.80 - 2784.48] doctor says your doctor says oxalates
[2782.40 - 2785.76] you go with the oxalates okay
[2784.48 - 2787.28] but i want you to be your own detective
[2785.76 - 2788.00] too and i want everybody to be on their
[2787.28 - 2791.20] own detective right
[2788.00 - 2794.80] now was there a new medical treatment
[2791.20 - 2797.76] someone might have done was there
[2794.80 - 2798.32] antibiotics someone might have taken
[2797.76 - 2800.48] back
[2798.32 - 2802.40] six months ago because six months later
[2800.48 - 2803.76] you can get an activation of all kinds
[2802.40 - 2805.36] of problems from antibiotics you've
[2803.76 - 2808.24] taken six months before
[2805.36 - 2810.24] was there nutritional yeast in your diet
[2808.24 - 2811.52] somewhere msg it builds up it builds up
[2810.24 - 2812.56] and builds up and then boom you've got
[2811.52 - 2814.64] body pain
[2812.56 - 2816.16] was there apple cider vinegar which
[2814.64 - 2816.80] pickles the liver pickles the liver
[2816.16 - 2818.24] breaks down
[2816.80 - 2820.16] the stomach glands cause problems and
[2818.24 - 2823.76] then boom you get pushed over
[2820.16 - 2826.32] was there anything else happening too
[2823.76 - 2827.92] was there high fat this medical medium
[2826.32 - 2829.04] doesn't recommend high fat if you're if
[2827.92 - 2831.04] you're trying to heal
[2829.04 - 2832.32] was there high fat in the diet how much
[2831.04 - 2834.32] avocado oils
[2832.32 - 2835.52] almond butter are you doing how much of
[2834.32 - 2838.64] all that are you doing
[2835.52 - 2840.56] was there a new pathogen infection
[2838.64 - 2841.92] that someone could have caught i'm
[2840.56 - 2844.56] giving you guys all this stuff so you'd
[2841.92 - 2847.68] be all your own detective right
[2844.56 - 2851.76] are you looking at everything before you
[2847.68 - 2855.36] go and hop on the oh it's my lectins
[2851.76 - 2858.72] that i'm eating oh it's oxalates oh
[2855.36 - 2861.12] was there a blood dross apparently if a
[2858.72 - 2864.16] doctor's looking at your oxalates
[2861.12 - 2865.84] the doctor must be taking some blood how
[2864.16 - 2866.96] much blood has the doctor been taking in
[2865.84 - 2868.80] the last year
[2866.96 - 2871.44] because if you're getting blood draws
[2868.80 - 2872.00] five vials seven vials four full vials
[2871.44 - 2874.88] eight full
[2872.00 - 2876.16] vials it adds up ten full vials your
[2874.88 - 2878.40] immune system drops
[2876.16 - 2881.04] then all of a sudden you get boom thrown
[2878.40 - 2884.56] into body pain later right
[2881.04 - 2887.44] and i'm not saying you know look
[2884.56 - 2889.44] i'm not saying hey don't believe your
[2887.44 - 2890.96] doctor you believe your doctor you do
[2889.44 - 2893.04] what your doctor says
[2890.96 - 2894.88] that's what i say do what your doctor
[2893.04 - 2896.16] says you listen to your doctor right if
[2894.88 - 2898.96] it was me
[2896.16 - 2900.08] i'd be like what else is going on okay
[2898.96 - 2903.04] the doctor just
[2900.08 - 2903.52] three weeks ago took eight vials from me
[2903.04 - 2906.88] what
[2903.52 - 2909.04] i had eight vials taken six months ago
[2906.88 - 2910.56] uh that's my immune system going out the
[2909.04 - 2912.80] window um
[2910.56 - 2914.64] i did eat some chocolate which has
[2912.80 - 2916.40] caffeine in it which is really bad when
[2914.64 - 2917.76] anybody's got any kind of pathogens or
[2916.40 - 2921.20] any kind of other problems
[2917.76 - 2922.48] i did have chocolate hmm yeah but i am
[2921.20 - 2923.92] saying i'm doing everything medical
[2922.48 - 2926.24] medium says
[2923.92 - 2928.00] um but medical medium doesn't say
[2926.24 - 2929.84] chocolate or in these other things he
[2928.00 - 2931.44] also tells you don't get the blood draws
[2929.84 - 2932.88] get ask your doctor to do something
[2931.44 - 2934.96] different on the medical mean podcast
[2932.88 - 2937.12] apple podcast all that information
[2934.96 - 2939.28] but i want you to be your own detectives
[2937.12 - 2940.96] out there like what else is happening
[2939.28 - 2942.88] did you have some matcha tea that
[2940.96 - 2943.68] caffeine will blow out your nervous
[2942.88 - 2946.00] system
[2943.68 - 2947.44] even if it's weeks later like what's
[2946.00 - 2949.68] going on
[2947.44 - 2951.36] and was there a new medical treatment at
[2949.68 - 2952.96] all was there an older medical
[2951.36 - 2954.96] treatment that happened a little while
[2952.96 - 2957.12] back was there
[2954.96 - 2958.96] um was there hot is the high fat going
[2957.12 - 2960.32] on because medical medium knows that
[2958.96 - 2961.92] when you're healing
[2960.32 - 2963.68] if you do the high fats you're going to
[2961.92 - 2965.76] eventually get yourself sick right you
[2963.68 - 2967.76] got to learn how to lower the fats right
[2965.76 - 2968.88] and what kind of supplements is the
[2967.76 - 2970.72] person using too
[2968.88 - 2972.24] is there alcohol in them is there is
[2970.72 - 2973.92] there citric acid in them
[2972.24 - 2976.08] is there other things in there there and
[2973.92 - 2977.60] all that and do they know the protocols
[2976.08 - 2980.08] they're taking right
[2977.60 - 2981.60] but so it's important to know that
[2980.08 - 2982.80] there's a lot of tools to get better
[2981.60 - 2985.20] with medical medium
[2982.80 - 2986.32] it's not it's not it's not
[2985.20 - 2988.96] straightforward like
[2986.32 - 2990.24] i've been doing medical medium i've done
[2988.96 - 2992.72] all medical medium
[2990.24 - 2994.24] really because when you really do
[2992.72 - 2996.48] medical medium
[2994.24 - 2998.40] you really do it you're a deep in the
[2996.48 - 3000.00] mono eating cleanse
[2998.40 - 3002.08] you're deep in the heavy metal detox
[3000.00 - 3005.52] smoothie with the right stuff
[3002.08 - 3008.48] you're deep into the anti-radiation tea
[3005.52 - 3010.64] you're deep into the 369 advanced you're
[3008.48 - 3013.20] deep into the protocols and dosages
[3010.64 - 3014.40] of what degree of protocols and dosages
[3013.20 - 3017.60] you're deep in top
[3014.40 - 3019.68] you're deep into it no corn no chocolate
[3017.60 - 3021.20] no caffeine no nutritional yeast no
[3019.68 - 3023.84] apple cider vinegar
[3021.20 - 3024.96] ah you're deep into it and your lemon
[3023.84 - 3028.32] water can't be
[3024.96 - 3031.36] in hot water your lemon water
[3028.32 - 3032.56] can't be hot water are you doing 32
[3031.36 - 3035.12] ounces of celery juice

[3035.12 - 3038.32] okay
[3035.68 - 3039.52] so what happens is what i love is when
[3038.32 - 3042.00] people say
[3039.52 - 3044.64] oh yeah no i did on medical medium or
[3042.00 - 3048.48] i'm doing all medical medium
