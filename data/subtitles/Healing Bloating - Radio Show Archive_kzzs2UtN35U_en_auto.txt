[36.24 - 38.60] that when we don't have the right
[37.28 - 40.40] information and we're dealing with
[38.60 - 42.04] misinformation and disinformation all
[40.40 - 43.44] the time the stuff that's circulating
[42.04 - 45.52] everywhere in the books and the internet
[43.44 - 48.60] and everything else we lose 10 years of
[45.52 - 50.20] our life we lose 10 years of time we
[48.60 - 52.64] could have gotten better or could have
[50.20 - 54.20] gotten so much better to a point where a
[52.64 - 56.08] higher quality of life a better quality
[54.20 - 58.16] of life I've seen people have anxiety of
[56.08 - 61.56] the most crippling crippling anxiety or
[58.16 - 62.64] depression and it and if they and they
[61.56 - 65.32] they went through it through life and
[62.64 - 66.84] then they got it better and they got it
[65.32 - 68.24] better doing some things that we have in
[66.84 - 69.76] the medical medium series books and
[68.24 - 73.36] everything else and they were just like
[69.76 - 74.96] oh my God if I only knew this years ago
[73.36 - 77.12] what would I've done I mean if I only
[74.96 - 79.48] knew about the celery juice how it
[77.12 - 82.40] reduced my anxiety and just took it down
[79.48 - 85.52] from level eight level 10 down to level
[82.40 - 88.24] one to level zero I mean it's things
[85.52 - 90.40] like that the whole point is Advanced
[88.24 - 93.20] information to make sure
[90.40 - 95.20] that you can move forward healing and
[93.20 - 97.28] and and actually you know beat Decades
[95.20 - 98.72] of time that research and science
[97.28 - 101.96] doesn't know about things out there it's
[98.72 - 103.80] crazy look at what celery juice this is
[101.96 - 105.92] one example of the medical medium series
[103.80 - 108.08] look at what celery juice is doing for
[105.92 - 110.12] Millions globally now that we've we got
[108.08 - 111.40] it out there that we actually that
[110.12 - 114.28] Spirit put the information out there
[111.40 - 116.28] look what it's doing it's unbelievable
[114.28 - 118.28] okay and there's no research in science
[116.28 - 120.60] at all has that's attached to it
[118.28 - 121.92] whatsoever in fact you'll even see
[120.60 - 123.68] articles now they just totally
[121.92 - 125.40] conventional articles and whatnot and in
[123.68 - 128.12] media like what is this celery juice
[125.40 - 130.04] cleanse I mean the celery juice trend is
[128.12 - 132.16] it good is it bad what is it they don't
[130.04 - 133.24] even have a clue no one even has a clue
[132.16 - 136.08] it's
[133.24 - 137.36] unbelievable and so if if research and
[136.08 - 139.24] science is what you're relying on in
[137.36 - 141.88] chronic illness on any level it's it's
[139.24 - 143.60] not a really good thing it's not a
[141.88 - 145.48] really good thing with mystery chronic
[143.60 - 146.80] illness it's not because it's a whole
[145.48 - 149.48] that's the whole point and that's an
[146.80 - 150.48] advanced that's an advanced piece of
[149.48 - 152.48] information
[150.48 - 154.00] that's literally changing the lives of
[152.48 - 155.88] so many and I'm talking about celery
[154.00 - 159.00] juice for a reason because today's topic
[155.88 - 162.12] is bloating we're talking about
[159.00 - 164.64] bloating very important like why do we
[162.12 - 166.48] bloat who's bloating are you bloating
[164.64 - 168.72] are you getting bloated the whole bit
[166.48 - 170.24] would you like to not be bloated you
[168.72 - 171.60] know it people walk around bloated they
[170.24 - 173.12] get so used to it they just been bloated
[171.60 - 174.56] for years whatever we're going to work
[173.12 - 177.20] on it this is going to it's going to be
[174.56 - 180.64] all about bloating on this talk it's
[177.20 - 182.04] very important so the bottom line is
[180.64 - 185.00] you know the information you're going to
[182.04 - 188.08] receive today is it's not it's not you
[185.00 - 191.72] know tampered with it's not contaminated
[188.08 - 193.36] it's pure clean information that's not
[191.72 - 194.92] out there yet it's like that in every
[193.36 - 196.60] medical medium radio show it's out there
[194.92 - 198.20] in all the free information we put out
[196.60 - 199.60] all the time it's out there in the
[198.20 - 201.84] Articles we put out at Medical
[199.60 - 203.20] medium.com it's out there in Facebook we
[201.84 - 205.08] put out there all the information and
[203.20 - 206.80] Instagram you name it it's all out there
[205.08 - 210.16] if you're new to the show make sure you
[206.80 - 211.64] get the free information you have to go
[210.16 - 213.84] to my website and be like oh I have to
[211.64 - 216.16] pay $35 a month oh wait a minute I have
[213.84 - 217.56] to buy this $5,000 cleanse oh wait a
[216.16 - 219.72] minute what do I have to buy all these
[217.56 - 221.24] supplements and then buy the book along
[219.72 - 223.16] with it and buy $1,000 worth the
[221.24 - 224.76] supplements no what do we it's not about
[223.16 - 226.80] that it's not we're not selling anything
[224.76 - 229.16] besides we're giving information so you
[226.80 - 230.56] heal and get better if you can't afford
[229.16 - 232.20] the live a rescue book because that's
[230.56 - 233.76] what this is all about and bloating has
[232.20 - 235.32] everything to do with live a rescue and
[233.76 - 238.12] the live a rescue book if you can't
[235.32 - 240.36] afford a book whatever it is $155 or
[238.12 - 241.84] whatever it is go to go to the library
[240.36 - 243.68] and get it there I always say that
[241.84 - 245.88] because I don't care please go to the
[243.68 - 248.48] library everybody go doesn't matter to
[245.88 - 250.64] me as long as you're healing and that's
[248.48 - 253.24] the whole point so let's go into
[250.64 - 255.48] bloating let's talk about this it's an
[253.24 - 259.64] important thing because research and
[255.48 - 261.80] sign still knows nothing about bloating
[259.64 - 263.08] nothing it's what you're going to find
[261.80 - 265.72] out there it's like not just the wild
[263.08 - 267.36] west but it's really just like the
[265.72 - 269.60] information out there is what I'm saying
[267.36 - 271.04] is it's try this try that eat this way
[269.60 - 272.84] everybody's got a new fangle diet a
[271.04 - 275.40] trendy diet they got this this take out
[272.84 - 277.56] processed foods take out gluten and yeah
[275.40 - 279.04] that does help you take out gluten and
[277.56 - 281.48] sometimes people lose their bloating
[279.04 - 283.96] absolutely you take out dairy products
[281.48 - 286.32] sometimes they lose their bloating but
[283.96 - 289.44] it's not as simple as that for so many
[286.32 - 292.72] people and why were they bloating if
[289.44 - 295.36] they were bloating to gluten why why
[292.72 - 296.52] were they bloating if they were and if
[295.36 - 298.00] you're sitting out there saying well
[296.52 - 299.24] what about lectin he's not talking about
[298.00 - 300.52] lectin he doesn't have advanced
[299.24 - 302.92] information first of all that's not
[300.52 - 304.64] Advanced information lectin second of
[302.92 - 307.80] all the lectin theory is completely all
[304.64 - 309.48] wrong completely all wrong that's the
[307.80 - 311.84] other thing in fact I talk about that in
[309.48 - 313.60] Liver Rescue the whole lectin thing is
[311.84 - 315.04] completely wrong there's lectin in every
[313.60 - 316.88] fruit and every vegetable so you know
[315.04 - 319.16] what don't eat any fruits and vegetables
[316.88 - 321.32] don't see where it gets you see where it
[319.16 - 323.88] gets you don't eat any fruits don't eat
[321.32 - 326.48] any vegetables don't eat don't eat any
[323.88 - 329.24] of that and just because you want to
[326.48 - 330.80] avoid eltin see where that gets you I
[329.24 - 332.48] can't even tell you how many holes are
[330.80 - 334.24] in the lectin thing you don't even know
[332.48 - 337.36] you don't even you got to read LI or
[334.24 - 339.52] rescue to even know and but you know the
[337.36 - 341.40] whole thing there's a lot of proteins
[339.52 - 343.00] there's a lot of proteins that are more
[341.40 - 345.32] destructive than
[343.00 - 347.76] lectins they're way more destructive and
[345.32 - 350.64] they're not in fruits and vegetables the
[347.76 - 352.80] lectins are actually harmless it's other
[350.64 - 354.24] proteins that the science and research
[352.80 - 357.92] don't even have mapped out there's so
[354.24 - 359.68] many proteins in in Grain in certain
[357.92 - 361.12] grain and I'm going even talk talking
[359.68 - 363.92] about the whole gluten thing there's
[361.12 - 365.36] just so many proteins and and those are
[363.92 - 367.08] disturbing because what they do is they
[365.36 - 370.08] feed like gluten does they feed
[367.08 - 371.80] pathogens which guess what guess what
[370.08 - 373.20] nobody knows in the any of the medical
[371.80 - 375.08] communities and I'm telling you that now
[373.20 - 376.40] so you can be this is all about arming
[375.08 - 378.96] you and making sure you become the
[376.40 - 380.48] expert if I come off as like a pain in
[378.96 - 382.12] the butt and I come off where you know
[380.48 - 383.64] sarcastic or whatever it is I come off a
[382.12 - 385.52] little Brash whatever it is it's only
[383.64 - 388.28] because I want you to become an
[385.52 - 389.96] expert because if I'm not a good teacher
[388.28 - 391.76] and I don't I don't maybe I suck as a
[389.96 - 393.80] teacher maybe I totally suck as a
[391.76 - 395.40] teacher I'm doing the best I can but I'm
[393.80 - 397.44] trying to be a good teacher so that you
[395.40 - 400.72] get the information you become the
[397.44 - 403.96] expert that you need to be and and
[400.72 - 406.00] that's just the bottom line and so what
[403.96 - 407.88] happens is with like gluten it feeds
[406.00 - 409.28] pathogens it feeds viruses it feeds
[407.88 - 410.64] viruses like Epstein bar it feeds
[409.28 - 413.28] viruses like all the different viruses
[410.64 - 414.48] hhv6 it feeds all that stuff strap the
[413.28 - 418.00] bacteria and
[414.48 - 420.08] everything it feeds all those things and
[418.00 - 421.84] then and then now that's one of the
[420.08 - 423.20] reasons why people bloat if you got
[421.84 - 424.44] strep if you got a little acne and
[423.20 - 425.32] everything and you're eating gluten or
[424.44 - 427.84] you're eating something you're not
[425.32 - 430.00] supposed to be eating dairy or eggs or
[427.84 - 431.92] anything Dairy eggs whatever like I said
[430.00 - 434.44] milk cheese butter yogurt kefir whatever
[431.92 - 436.52] it is you know Lamb's milk I don't know
[434.44 - 438.76] what people drink anymore sheep's milk
[436.52 - 442.08] the whole bit it Whatever It Is goats
[438.76 - 444.00] milk and if you're if you're
[442.08 - 446.48] actually you know if you're actually
[444.00 - 449.48] eating any of that and and you're
[446.48 - 451.16] bloating up yeah of course that's
[449.48 - 453.04] because you're you're you're feeding a
[451.16 - 454.52] pathogen you're feeding strep in the gut
[453.04 - 456.56] you're feeding strep inside the gut
[454.52 - 458.52] that's the whole point so the bottom
[456.56 - 459.88] line is it's about getting you better
[458.52 - 461.80] it's about making sure that you're in
[459.88 - 463.88] the right situation with all of this and
[461.80 - 465.16] having the right information and and
[463.88 - 466.32] that's a piece of it all on its own cuz
[465.16 - 467.48] you know what research and Science and
[466.32 - 469.36] everything else doesn't even know about
[467.48 - 471.16] what's happening with with gluten alone
[469.36 - 473.36] feeding bugs and what kind of bugs and
[471.16 - 475.04] everything about it so it isn't just
[473.36 - 477.48] like the gluten thing it isn't just like
[475.04 - 478.68] that and it's more it's much more than
[477.48 - 480.84] that we're going to go into depth about
[478.68 - 483.08] it all because someone can eat all the
[480.84 - 484.60] bread and gluten they want yeah if they
[483.08 - 485.80] don't have all kinds of viruses or they
[484.60 - 486.96] don't have a good strep in their
[485.80 - 489.12] intestinal tract that's sitting there
[486.96 - 491.28] feeding on it all the time you know
[489.12 - 492.52] giving more bloating or other situations
[491.28 - 494.36] like that or any kind of symptom
[492.52 - 497.00] constipation any kind of cramping pain
[494.36 - 499.16] whatever it is if if if if it's not just
[497.00 - 500.52] that basically what I'm trying to say is
[499.16 - 503.08] there's people that can eat anything
[500.52 - 504.80] they want they're not getting bloating
[503.08 - 509.92] but they eventually will and they
[504.80 - 513.36] eventually do no one escapes bloating no
[509.92 - 517.52] one does unless they actually
[513.36 - 519.40] repair what has gone wrong for so many
[517.52 - 522.96] years it has everything to do with the
[519.40 - 525.28] liver you know children bloat they bloat
[522.96 - 527.92] from the very beginning because of the
[525.28 - 530.36] liver and then because of also pathogens
[527.92 - 533.44] like strep and everything else and
[530.36 - 535.32] children have these pathogens absolutely
[533.44 - 538.28] and they bloat and and they get weak
[535.32 - 539.80] hydrochloric acid very weak digestion
[538.28 - 541.44] very weak digestion and it can happen
[539.80 - 542.72] when you're younger and there could be
[541.44 - 544.12] people that are not bloating they don't
[542.72 - 545.36] bloat they don't bloat and they just go
[544.12 - 548.12] through life but they'll bloat
[545.36 - 549.80] eventually everybody will no matter who
[548.12 - 552.08] it is
[549.80 - 554.68] everybody will because you're going to
[552.08 - 556.20] be doing something wrong with their diet
[554.68 - 557.60] and whatever their constitution is
[556.20 - 559.48] meaning in a sense where they they don't
[557.60 - 560.76] have a lot of bugs their liver was
[559.48 - 562.40] strong to begin with and their liver
[560.76 - 564.40] didn't actually break down over the time
[562.40 - 566.32] over the years fast enough or like some
[564.40 - 568.08] people it breaks down because of stress
[566.32 - 569.72] High adrenaline adrenaline flooding into
[568.08 - 572.52] the liver and then it breaks down over
[569.72 - 574.40] time and some people less stress with
[572.52 - 576.24] less adrenaline you know all kinds of
[574.40 - 578.20] different things like that uh different
[576.24 - 580.56] resources different Lifestyles whatever
[578.20 - 582.76] it is and whatever it is the bloating is
[580.56 - 586.24] going to come it's going to come it's
[582.76 - 589.40] going to it just is I've been in this
[586.24 - 591.12] long enough over 30 years just just
[589.40 - 592.84] practicing alone helping people just
[591.12 - 594.68] oneon-one over the years never mind
[592.84 - 596.28] doing the books and then years later
[594.68 - 597.76] doing the books and all the information
[596.28 - 599.52] we put out and everything like that that
[597.76 - 600.92] I put out that spirit and I put out when
[599.52 - 604.08] I say we it's you know spirit and I
[600.92 - 606.24] putting it out the thing is is that the
[604.08 - 608.20] bottom line the bottom line is for you
[606.24 - 612.60] to understand one thing that's so
[608.20 - 616.40] important and everybody will
[612.60 - 618.72] bloat whether anybody likes it or not
[616.40 - 621.92] unless you know what's going on unless
[618.72 - 624.56] you know why unless you repair the hands
[621.92 - 627.32] of time unless you repair and go back
[624.56 - 629.52] and repair the hands of time and by
[627.32 - 631.56] doing that is guess what making good to
[629.52 - 633.80] the liver making good with the liver and
[631.56 - 635.72] making sure that the diet is Right long
[633.80 - 637.48] enough with the right things and tools
[635.72 - 639.24] in there making sure you're healing the
[637.48 - 641.60] right things long enough even if you're
[639.24 - 642.84] doing some caman trendy thing out there
[641.60 - 644.24] whatever and it helped your bloating and
[642.84 - 645.16] you stopped this and you stopped eating
[644.24 - 646.44] that for a little while and your
[645.16 - 648.04] bloating started getting better whatever
[646.44 - 651.28] it is the bloating will come back it
[648.04 - 653.48] just does it does it does unless you do
[651.28 - 655.32] what you you need to do unless you know
[653.48 - 657.96] what's going really going on with the
[655.32 - 659.80] liver the bloating comes back if you
[657.96 - 661.12] think everybody's immune to bloating
[659.80 - 662.52] except for you if you think people are
[661.12 - 663.88] walking around immune to bloating except
[662.52 - 668.32] for you you're
[663.88 - 673.96] wrong drastically drastically wrong no
[668.32 - 678.00] one is immune to bloating no one gets a
[673.96 - 681.76] free get out of bloating card jail card
[678.00 - 684.24] free whatever no one does I'm being
[681.76 - 687.88] straight up I'm telling you right now
[684.24 - 689.84] I'm being straight up so the bottom line
[687.88 - 693.08] is let's let's go into this a little bit
[689.84 - 695.52] let's talk about it when the liver
[693.08 - 697.56] weakens okay when the liver weakens and
[695.52 - 700.68] becomes sluggish a sluggish liver that's
[697.56 - 702.64] right in any way such as when pathogens
[700.68 - 706.24] like EBV and poisons like toxic heavy
[702.64 - 709.36] metals come to visit or when fatty liver
[706.24 - 712.04] develops it produces lower quality bile
[709.36 - 714.28] so it's all about the
[712.04 - 715.84] bile you know and hey look you know in
[714.28 - 717.92] real estate it's all about the location
[715.84 - 720.28] it's all about the location all about
[717.92 - 724.72] the location whatever that's what you
[720.28 - 727.64] hear it's all about that and um and with
[724.72 - 730.60] the liver and with
[727.64 - 734.16] bloing it's all about
[730.60 - 736.08] bile that's what it's about so just just
[734.16 - 737.72] remember that really important thing to
[736.08 - 740.36] know cuz we're going into this right now
[737.72 - 744.64] we're going to go deep into this but
[740.36 - 748.64] it's all about that so listen the bottom
[744.64 - 752.04] line is this is not a proud situation
[748.64 - 755.20] for your liver when it weakens it's
[752.04 - 756.56] not because the liver the liver lobules
[755.20 - 759.36] these little little little cell
[756.56 - 761.92] structures inside the liver they're all
[759.36 - 764.32] about quality
[761.92 - 767.12] control they're all about quality of
[764.32 - 770.20] bile they're all about quality and
[767.12 - 773.92] quantity that's what they're all about
[770.20 - 777.68] so if the liver is releasing bile that's
[773.92 - 780.12] less than that's less than it truly is a
[777.68 - 782.96] sign that it's old overburdened and how
[780.12 - 784.40] would you know how would you know and it
[782.96 - 785.88] doesn't matter what kind of fancy diet
[784.40 - 788.00] someone's giving you out there whatever
[785.88 - 790.36] and blah blah this that diet
[788.00 - 792.12] whatever you know diet for your blood
[790.36 - 795.00] diet for this diet for that whatever's
[792.12 - 797.04] going on out there is it really about
[795.00 - 799.88] your B does anybody even know what's
[797.04 - 804.76] going on and what's happening in there
[799.88 - 808.40] yeah and so the bottom line is so if the
[804.76 - 812.84] liver is releasing bile that's less than
[808.40 - 815.12] it's truly ass signed sign that it's
[812.84 - 818.00] overburdened that it's
[815.12 - 819.52] overburdened so even when compromised
[818.00 - 823.24] even when the liver's compromised it's
[819.52 - 826.72] using every single Reserve every single
[823.24 - 830.08] source of energy it has to produce the
[826.72 - 833.08] strongest bile it possibly can and I'll
[830.08 - 835.92] tell you why because everybody's on a
[833.08 - 839.52] high fat diet I'm sorry but everybody's
[835.92 - 841.24] on a high fat diet you don't you don't
[839.52 - 842.60] know you're on a high fat diet call it
[841.24 - 844.72] high protein then are you on a high
[842.60 - 846.92] protein diet hey are you on a high
[844.72 - 850.32] protein diet turning my head different
[846.92 - 850.32] ways are you on a high protein
[850.80 - 856.28] diet yeah because if you're on a high
[853.36 - 858.32] protein diet that's a high fat diet
[856.28 - 862.64] that's a high fat diet that's what that
[858.32 - 864.56] is sorry sorry about this news sorry
[862.64 - 866.32] believe me I don't I don't like
[864.56 - 868.08] delivering I you know what when you
[866.32 - 869.72] deliver the truth about all this stuff
[868.08 - 871.76] and how things work every time we do a
[869.72 - 873.04] radio show and you do it in the books
[871.76 - 875.88] and everything else and you put the
[873.04 - 878.00] truth out there you know it's it's scary
[875.88 - 879.44] because yeah no one wants to know the
[878.00 - 881.92] truth I mean who wants to know the truth
[879.44 - 884.40] I mean unless I'm wrong I I I might be
[881.92 - 886.92] just wrong because you guys want to know
[884.40 - 890.00] the truth so me you know what I'm
[886.92 - 892.32] wrong totally wrong because I know you
[890.00 - 893.76] you want you want the truth you know I
[892.32 - 895.32] don't know where I get that where hey
[893.76 - 897.04] nobody wants to know the truth out there
[895.32 - 898.40] I mean you know people don't like seeing
[897.04 - 900.44] the truth they don't know the truth I
[898.40 - 902.88] mean because you guys are here you want
[900.44 - 904.72] the truth on this so you know you see so
[902.88 - 905.84] I got a lot to learn I still have a lot
[904.72 - 909.84] to
[905.84 - 913.24] learn still the liver has 2,000 over
[909.84 - 916.88] 2,000 undiscovered chemical functions to
[913.24 - 920.60] perform and some of them okay go into
[916.88 - 923.08] the immune support and they're more
[920.60 - 926.60] important than
[923.08 - 929.08] bile they're more important than bile so
[926.60 - 931.80] the bile will weaken and bile is
[929.08 - 933.52] important but it'll weaken because your
[931.80 - 934.72] immune system is more important
[933.52 - 936.40] especially if you're dealing with
[934.72 - 938.64] pathogens like everybody else and I'm
[936.40 - 941.00] going to say it right now I don't care
[938.64 - 942.44] who you are where you come from what
[941.00 - 944.76] part of the planet you're on I don't
[942.44 - 947.00] care if you're an alien from another
[944.76 - 950.20] planet and you landed on a spacecraft
[947.00 - 952.64] the other day you got a pathogen inside
[950.20 - 955.32] the liver everybody has pathogens inside
[952.64 - 958.96] the liver you can't not have pathogens
[955.32 - 962.56] inside your liver it would be bizarre it
[958.96 - 963.96] would be clearly bizarre if you if you
[962.56 - 966.56] actually didn't have pathogens in the
[963.96 - 967.60] liver because even if you had strep one
[966.56 - 969.04] time in your life or didn't even know
[967.60 - 971.48] you have it it's causing a little bit of
[969.04 - 975.88] acne it's inside the liver that's just
[971.48 - 980.76] one of just dozens of of
[975.88 - 981.96] possibilities so lower levels of less
[980.76 - 985.64] powerful
[981.96 - 987.52] bile mean the breaking down of food
[985.64 - 991.40] becomes a
[987.52 - 993.20] problem but what kind of food what's the
[991.40 - 997.00] problem
[993.20 - 999.08] fats avocado oh spiles weak it's not
[997.00 - 1001.40] going to disperse it good break it down
[999.08 - 1003.00] NOP chicken oh bile is weak it's not
[1001.40 - 1006.72] going to break it down good enough there
[1003.00 - 1008.48] you no nope nope no grass-fed beef nope
[1006.72 - 1010.00] lots of fat in that yeah there is I
[1008.48 - 1011.72] don't care what anybody says right in
[1010.00 - 1013.68] the lean cuts of meat plenty of fat what
[1011.72 - 1014.80] do you think that juices if you throw it
[1013.68 - 1019.92] on the
[1014.80 - 1022.84] grill yeah you know there you go you got
[1019.92 - 1026.64] there you go why does it feel

[1104.00 - 1110.20] vegan bile has to break it down that's
[1107.56 - 1112.32] right that's right and that could be
[1110.20 - 1115.16] kind of okay if your liver isn't
[1112.32 - 1116.56] burdened already if you don't have two
[1115.16 - 1118.12] varieties of Epstein bar sitting in
[1116.56 - 1120.68] there that caus Hashim Modas when you're
[1118.12 - 1122.16] 50 years old or you don't have you know
[1120.68 - 1124.64] something else going on there that's not
[1122.16 - 1126.88] causing something or two varieties of
[1124.64 - 1129.20] strep because you had strep throat years
[1126.88 - 1130.72] ago and you get UTI periodically in your
[1129.20 - 1134.04] life you got all the strep inside the
[1130.72 - 1136.08] liver cyto egler virus hhp 6s which are
[1134.04 - 1138.80] all in there it's Rosas when people you
[1136.08 - 1140.88] know when kids get Rosas little babies
[1138.80 - 1143.04] or they get Ros Olas and they get jais
[1140.88 - 1145.52] because they got they got hhv6 in their
[1143.04 - 1148.12] liver sitting there their whole lifetime
[1145.52 - 1150.08] that's how it works and in the liver get
[1148.12 - 1151.20] sluggish and SL you can kill viruses too
[1150.08 - 1152.36] why do you think I put out thyroid
[1151.20 - 1153.84] healing the book thyroid healing if you
[1152.36 - 1154.88] don't have a copy of that get a copy of
[1153.84 - 1158.72] thyroid
[1154.88 - 1160.52] healing you get if if yeah get a copy
[1158.72 - 1164.12] can't afford it go to the library
[1160.52 - 1165.48] whatever but the bottom line is is that
[1164.12 - 1168.64] all the stuff is inside the liver then
[1165.48 - 1172.24] you got Mercury lead arsenic cadmium
[1168.64 - 1175.08] copper nickel steel Chrome Alloys you
[1172.24 - 1177.84] get all this metal titanium everything
[1175.08 - 1180.04] sitting inside the liver titanium yeah
[1177.84 - 1181.76] where where'd you get titanium where'd
[1180.04 - 1184.64] you get that I mean is it dental
[1181.76 - 1187.40] implants or is it Pharmaceuticals over
[1184.64 - 1190.32] the years because they're loaded with
[1187.40 - 1191.80] titanium Pharmaceuticals antibiotics at
[1190.32 - 1194.48] petroleum they're petroleum based they
[1191.80 - 1195.76] got Metals in it too petroleum is not
[1194.48 - 1197.44] necessarily metal but what I'm saying is
[1195.76 - 1199.28] they also have Metals in it too they got
[1197.44 - 1201.12] all that
[1199.28 - 1203.36] I mean Pharmaceuticals aren't screened
[1201.12 - 1205.60] for all this stuff they even add it in
[1203.36 - 1208.68] there goes into the liver fills up in
[1205.60 - 1211.32] the liver detergents air fresheners
[1208.68 - 1213.20] colog perfumes gasoline at the gas
[1211.32 - 1215.64] station you're pumping every single day
[1213.20 - 1217.24] Foods preservatives junk you've eaten 20
[1215.64 - 1221.08] years ago it's all still inside the
[1217.24 - 1223.64] liver every last bit of it every last
[1221.08 - 1227.04] bit of it is inside the liver smoke from
[1223.64 - 1228.80] a bombfire from treated wood gas grill
[1227.04 - 1229.96] gas stoves and you can't run from some
[1228.80 - 1231.44] of this you got to live with some of
[1229.96 - 1232.64] this absolutely so you can't be afraid
[1231.44 - 1234.48] you just have to help clean out your
[1232.64 - 1236.28] liver it's why I did Liver Rescue Liver
[1234.48 - 1238.20] Rescue 369 is in the book and everything
[1236.28 - 1240.56] for people want to cleanse liver and the
[1238.20 - 1242.40] whole bit and learn about the liver but
[1240.56 - 1245.92] it's all sitting inside the liver all
[1242.40 - 1248.00] these things and more much more than I'm
[1245.92 - 1250.80] even saying petrochemical solvents
[1248.00 - 1252.52] Plastics I can go on and on and on DDT
[1250.80 - 1254.28] pesticides herbicides fungicides
[1252.52 - 1256.40] rodenticides all sitting in the side
[1254.28 - 1257.96] insecticides from bug killer sprayed in
[1256.40 - 1258.76] apartments how many apartments have I
[1257.96 - 1261.12] had
[1258.76 - 1262.68] over the years that I I walk in and I'm
[1261.12 - 1264.24] like you know what this is all I could
[1262.68 - 1266.28] afford this is all I could live in right
[1264.24 - 1268.56] now this is the only this is the only
[1266.28 - 1270.72] place I I just got to settle I have to I
[1268.56 - 1273.08] have to get this apartment this is it
[1270.72 - 1274.32] right here you know it's $1,000 a month
[1273.08 - 1275.96] or whatever I got to get into this
[1274.32 - 1278.24] apartment let me just you know survive
[1275.96 - 1279.48] here and it's filled with insecticides
[1278.24 - 1281.44] and I got to live in it because it's
[1279.48 - 1283.68] been sprayed a 100 times for 100 people
[1281.44 - 1285.36] for cockroaches and every other every
[1283.68 - 1287.76] other thing going all the way back how
[1285.36 - 1288.64] many how many apartments have I lived in
[1287.76 - 1291.76] like that
[1288.64 - 1294.16] over the years going back it's like it
[1291.76 - 1296.28] it's like seriously and the pesticide
[1294.16 - 1299.20] just breathing it in inhaling
[1296.28 - 1300.72] it yeah we all have that we all have and
[1299.20 - 1303.04] you can't run from that so there's a lot
[1300.72 - 1304.40] of things you can't run from walking in
[1303.04 - 1305.88] the park getting sprayed with Roundup
[1304.40 - 1307.28] Ready all the time or walking the park
[1305.88 - 1308.84] with Dew on the grass and all that
[1307.28 - 1310.68] Roundup Ready from the night before from
[1308.84 - 1312.88] the lands Keepers all spraying all the
[1310.68 - 1315.16] parks down all the time and just walking
[1312.88 - 1317.64] along and what about the what about all
[1315.16 - 1319.80] this crap from our parents that's still
[1317.64 - 1321.72] that's funneled back down from whatever
[1319.80 - 1323.40] they did in their life like smoking and
[1321.72 - 1326.52] drinking or whatever it is and just all
[1323.40 - 1327.64] kinds of bad food and exposure and then
[1326.52 - 1329.24] from their parents it's all sitting
[1327.64 - 1331.36] inside the livers getting passed down to
[1329.24 - 1332.80] our livers and it builds up and all the
[1331.36 - 1335.52] Mercury that's inside the liver and
[1332.80 - 1336.60] everything else and then you you and
[1335.52 - 1338.16] then you talk about the different
[1336.60 - 1339.64] pathogens that are being passed around
[1338.16 - 1341.20] everywhere you can easily pick up you
[1339.64 - 1342.44] pick it up for bathrooms these days I
[1341.20 - 1344.08] mean you could pick it up if you're not
[1342.44 - 1346.28] careful you got to Handy wipe everything
[1344.08 - 1348.60] you handy wipe your hands you got to
[1346.28 - 1349.76] Handy wipe things you go to the grocery
[1348.60 - 1351.24] store you're touching the carriage you
[1349.76 - 1352.56] got to Handy wipe your hands you got to
[1351.24 - 1353.84] you know I handy wipe the carriage
[1352.56 - 1356.20] handle but then again I can't go
[1353.84 - 1357.80] shopping anymore when I it's just it's
[1356.20 - 1359.72] too hard for me as it is cuz readings
[1357.80 - 1362.64] come through 24/7 and now I can't even
[1359.72 - 1365.52] walk into a store I can't because then I
[1362.64 - 1367.20] have to I have to answer questions and I
[1365.52 - 1369.24] can't do that I'll never get anything
[1367.20 - 1370.68] done the last door I went into I I it
[1369.24 - 1373.52] took me an hour and a half to hour and
[1370.68 - 1376.68] 45 minutes to get out I never bought my
[1373.52 - 1378.20] mangoes I never bought my mangoes
[1376.68 - 1379.96] because I because people came up up and
[1378.20 - 1381.48] said oh you're you know you're aw you're
[1379.96 - 1383.16] Anthony Anthony William the medical
[1381.48 - 1384.56] medium I got this health problem I got
[1383.16 - 1386.12] this can you get I got this wrong with
[1384.56 - 1387.88] me got this my sister's here here's got
[1386.12 - 1389.68] this this this this and I said I can't
[1387.88 - 1392.00] and and and I can't turn anybody down
[1389.68 - 1393.04] because I feel bad I feel bad for what
[1392.00 - 1395.96] they're going
[1393.04 - 1397.76] through I feel bad so I'll sit there for
[1395.96 - 1400.08] 2 hours I'll sit there for 3 hours one
[1397.76 - 1401.84] time I went to a store I I went to the
[1400.08 - 1404.64] store I got there 8:00 in the morning
[1401.84 - 1407.28] like 8:30 in the morning I left at 1:30
[1404.64 - 1408.88] 1:30 one time so I can't do it anymore
[1407.28 - 1410.12] because I I I I'm writing the books
[1408.88 - 1411.68] right now and doing everything else so I
[1410.12 - 1414.04] can't do that
[1411.68 - 1416.32] anymore but the point is I take out the
[1414.04 - 1417.76] handy wipes and I wipe the I wipe the
[1416.32 - 1419.96] carriage or
[1417.76 - 1421.32] something another thing too if I do too
[1419.96 - 1423.32] many readings like that I go blind
[1421.32 - 1424.92] anyway you guys know my story and then I
[1423.32 - 1426.44] can't pick out what I need to pick out I
[1424.92 - 1428.64] try to go to the store when if I ever go
[1426.44 - 1430.88] to a store I try to go early the less
[1428.64 - 1432.84] people the less readings I get instantly
[1430.88 - 1435.20] from Spirit the less chances I go snow
[1432.84 - 1437.88] blind and so I can pick out my mangoes
[1435.20 - 1439.88] and my tomatoes and get my frozen Wild
[1437.88 - 1442.52] blueberries and get all the things that
[1439.88 - 1444.40] I need and get my lettu uses and get my
[1442.52 - 1445.68] kale and get everything else I need and
[1444.40 - 1448.28] I could get it in time before I start
[1445.68 - 1449.60] losing my eyesight from all the people
[1448.28 - 1451.52] coming in in the readings and then if
[1449.60 - 1453.00] somebody asked me for reading forget it
[1451.52 - 1456.12] then I leave there practically blind I
[1453.00 - 1456.12] have to sit in the car and wait it
[1456.64 - 1462.28] out the bottom line
[1459.56 - 1464.88] is the liver gets filled up sorry about
[1462.28 - 1468.56] that you guys the liver gets filled with
[1464.88 - 1469.28] so many poisons and so many toxins and
[1468.56 - 1472.80] the
[1469.28 - 1474.16] bile breaks down and weakens and then
[1472.80 - 1475.92] there's one other thing I have to tell
[1474.16 - 1477.68] you the adrenaline Factor we're going to
[1475.92 - 1479.80] get into the rest of it don't worry the
[1477.68 - 1481.84] adrenaline Factor adrenaline pumping
[1479.80 - 1483.80] into the liver pumping into the liver
[1481.84 - 1487.44] and pumping into the liver from fight
[1483.80 - 1490.48] our flight yes fight or flight that's
[1487.44 - 1492.12] right that's right and that's happening
[1490.48 - 1494.20] in in our lives all the time and
[1492.12 - 1496.00] especially with like relationships and
[1494.20 - 1497.88] heartaches and and all kinds of things
[1496.00 - 1499.84] that happen emotional attacks mental
[1497.88 - 1501.80] abuse you know continual arguments with
[1499.84 - 1505.40] a spouse or partner dissatisfaction at
[1501.80 - 1507.72] work high pressure deadlines um you can
[1505.40 - 1511.24] keep on going on and on and on and
[1507.72 - 1513.00] on all that breakups heartbreak whatever
[1511.24 - 1515.72] just keep on going on and on and on
[1513.00 - 1518.04] backstabbing betrayal trust issues trust
[1515.72 - 1519.88] breakage all the adrenaline that floods
[1518.04 - 1521.80] because that and then also things that
[1519.88 - 1522.92] we do you know addictions and stuff all
[1521.80 - 1524.28] the different addictions I'm not talking
[1522.92 - 1525.68] about drug addictions there's so many
[1524.28 - 1528.56] different addictions it's ridiculous
[1525.68 - 1530.32] where the adrenaline runs
[1528.56 - 1532.04] chocolate eat chocolate adrenaline is
[1530.32 - 1533.56] pumping killing your liver eating
[1532.04 - 1536.44] chocolate you can have a little bit if
[1533.56 - 1537.92] you're into it but people eat it every
[1536.44 - 1538.96] day they're eating it every day and they
[1537.92 - 1540.44] think the healthy chocolate the
[1538.96 - 1541.96] healthier chocolate healthy chocolate
[1540.44 - 1543.76] blah blah blah meanwhile oh my God
[1541.96 - 1546.36] adrenaline adrenaline every day coffee
[1543.76 - 1547.88] chocolate coffee chocolate right to the
[1546.36 - 1549.32] liver adrenaline pumping into the liver
[1547.88 - 1550.84] weakening your bile more and more
[1549.32 - 1552.00] weakening it weakening it weakening it
[1550.84 - 1553.40] you know what happens when you weaken
[1552.00 - 1555.44] that bile and you keep on weakening it
[1553.40 - 1557.32] and the years go by and maybe you didn't
[1555.44 - 1558.88] bloat maybe you do bloat but yet but
[1557.32 - 1560.00] maybe you didn't but you're going to
[1558.88 - 1562.40] you're going to bloat and you're going
[1560.00 - 1564.36] to eventually bloat no matter what it's
[1562.40 - 1566.64] coming no matter how old you're going to
[1564.36 - 1569.48] be it's coming it's on your way you're
[1566.64 - 1571.24] going to get bloated absolutely I hate
[1569.48 - 1572.68] to be the bear of bad news the bringer
[1571.24 - 1573.88] of bad news but I'm just telling you
[1572.68 - 1576.08] this so you can do something about it
[1573.88 - 1579.04] and turn it around I'm not going to p p
[1576.08 - 1581.28] p patter around the truth and cookie cut
[1579.04 - 1584.40] crap I can't do that I've never been
[1581.28 - 1586.96] known to cookie you know to cookie cut
[1584.40 - 1588.52] anything I've never been known to cookie
[1586.96 - 1590.80] cut anything
[1588.52 - 1593.64] never been known to do that I
[1590.80 - 1596.32] can't I can't you
[1593.64 - 1599.80] know life is precious and we we have no
[1596.32 - 1602.80] time to waste
[1599.80 - 1604.44] so the deal is is the liver yeah the
[1602.80 - 1607.92] bile breaks down and then guess what
[1604.44 - 1611.32] happens guess what happens next your
[1607.92 - 1611.32] hydrochloric acid has to
[1611.68 - 1616.92] overproduce it has to overproduce
[1614.40 - 1618.32] overproduce the seven blend that science
[1616.92 - 1620.56] and research does even know about that I
[1618.32 - 1623.60] wrote about in book one medical medium
[1620.56 - 1626.24] that I talk about in this Liver Rescue
[1623.60 - 1630.80] book I talk about it in detail the seven
[1626.24 - 1632.12] blend gastric acid okay the gastric acid
[1630.80 - 1634.72] this the glands in the stomach to
[1632.12 - 1638.92] produce all the gastric gastric
[1634.72 - 1640.40] acid and and then that weakens and
[1638.92 - 1643.08] breaks
[1640.40 - 1645.84] down and hydrochloric acid breaks down
[1643.08 - 1648.92] and you got low HCL it started with your
[1645.84 - 1651.32] liver all low HCL starts with your liver
[1648.92 - 1653.16] all acid reflux gastric problems gastric
[1651.32 - 1655.88] distress everything starts with your
[1653.16 - 1658.04] liver everything in the digestive track
[1655.88 - 1660.84] starts in your with your
[1658.04 - 1662.20] liver your liver someone said to me so
[1660.84 - 1665.16] you wrote a book about the liver like
[1662.20 - 1665.16] who who cares about
[1667.78 - 1673.60] [Laughter]
[1670.20 - 1675.32] that I couldn't believe I couldn't
[1673.60 - 1679.36] believe what I
[1675.32 - 1684.48] heard I couldn't believe what I heard
[1679.36 - 1688.12] yeah yeah so anyway okay so bottom line
[1684.48 - 1691.48] is hydrochloric acid can weaken and the
[1688.12 - 1695.80] liver calls out for help and it's
[1691.48 - 1699.72] bioproduction flags and waines and
[1695.80 - 1702.88] waxes excess adrenaline from Life lowers
[1699.72 - 1704.12] the hydrochloric acid on top of it the
[1702.88 - 1706.72] emotional
[1704.12 - 1709.36] everything adrenaline is like a monkey
[1706.72 - 1710.60] wrench thrown into a delicate intricate
[1709.36 - 1713.16] swish
[1710.60 - 1716.64] grandfather wa clock what going to say
[1713.16 - 1719.40] watch clock Swiss grand grandfather
[1716.64 - 1721.76] clock it's like a neighbor dumping a
[1719.40 - 1725.08] bottle of beer into your pot of soup
[1721.76 - 1726.88] simmering on the stove that made that
[1725.08 - 1730.36] you made using your grandmother's
[1726.88 - 1732.44] perfect recipe check this out and this
[1730.36 - 1734.20] funny you're making your grandma's like
[1732.44 - 1735.96] perfect recipe or you found this recipe
[1734.20 - 1737.60] that you really really like or you've
[1735.96 - 1740.04] made it before and you really like like
[1737.60 - 1742.04] it and you got this you got this pot of
[1740.04 - 1744.52] soup simmering and it's really a good
[1742.04 - 1746.08] soup it's a healing soup on top of it
[1744.52 - 1748.12] and your neighbor believes that
[1746.08 - 1750.76] everything that you you know that you
[1748.12 - 1753.36] cook you know that you cook should
[1750.76 - 1755.80] should have beer in it should have beer
[1753.36 - 1758.04] in it beer on the grill on the chicken
[1755.80 - 1760.56] in the sauce the barbecue sauce
[1758.04 - 1763.40] marinating in beer whatever doing things
[1760.56 - 1765.80] that beer you know that whole beer thing
[1763.40 - 1767.76] and the neighbor just dumps a can of
[1765.80 - 1769.44] beer in your soup in the kitchen just
[1767.76 - 1772.04] but but you know honestly not thinking
[1769.44 - 1775.72] they're doing anything harmful and they
[1772.04 - 1777.36] know you even like beer maybe but you
[1775.72 - 1780.76] you don't want it in your
[1777.36 - 1783.12] soup yeah beer by the way lowers the
[1780.76 - 1784.56] hydrochloric acid and doesn't help the
[1783.12 - 1786.12] liver but you probably figured that one
[1784.56 - 1787.96] out already that's not science and
[1786.12 - 1789.32] research knows that one so you probably
[1787.96 - 1790.76] know about you've heard a little bit
[1789.32 - 1793.80] about that out
[1790.76 - 1798.56] there so when you lower your bile
[1793.80 - 1800.12] production bile salts lower hydrochloric
[1798.56 - 1802.40] acid
[1800.12 - 1805.44] lowers this is no
[1802.40 - 1810.04] joke and mineral salts in the seven
[1805.44 - 1813.64] blends of your stomach acid go down the
[1810.04 - 1814.84] drain all of it falls apart and you
[1813.64 - 1817.80] start to
[1814.84 - 1819.80] bloat the small intestine isn't able to
[1817.80 - 1822.92] absorb the nutrients it's meant to and
[1819.80 - 1824.80] proteins start to rot and fats start to
[1822.92 - 1827.88] go
[1824.80 - 1830.84] rancid proteins start to R
[1827.88 - 1833.40] and fats go rancid you want to heal a
[1830.84 - 1835.36] digestive problem it's not more protein
[1833.40 - 1836.84] more protein more protein like all the
[1835.36 - 1841.08] experts
[1836.84 - 1843.72] say no it's lowering protein lowering
[1841.08 - 1846.48] protein for God's sake lowering
[1843.72 - 1848.88] protein it's not increased fats increase
[1846.48 - 1850.08] fats increase fats when everything's
[1848.88 - 1852.60] going
[1850.08 - 1853.84] wrong when your small intestinal tra
[1852.60 - 1855.36] when your small intestinal tract is
[1853.84 - 1857.64] struggling everything is struggling your
[1855.36 - 1860.44] your your hydrochloric acid is is Rock
[1857.64 - 1863.28] Bottom your bile weakening you don't
[1860.44 - 1865.04] raise fats raise overt fats raise overt
[1863.28 - 1867.56] fats you don't raise proteins proteins
[1865.04 - 1869.36] prot you lower them if there's any
[1867.56 - 1873.56] digestive problems whatsoever you have
[1869.36 - 1875.24] to lower them and if it ain't fixed yet
[1873.56 - 1876.88] that's because you got years of stuff
[1875.24 - 1878.84] going on and everybody's got a different
[1876.88 - 1880.76] story so it may take a little longer for
[1878.84 - 1882.40] that celery juice to work and heal you
[1880.76 - 1884.44] and fix you and you have to have
[1882.40 - 1888.24] patience
[1884.44 - 1890.36] because if you can be a fly on the
[1888.24 - 1891.88] in some people's lives and see the
[1890.36 - 1893.12] amount of stress or what's going on in
[1891.88 - 1894.80] relationships or whatever that's
[1893.12 - 1897.44] stressing them out causing adrenals to
[1894.80 - 1899.52] run all the time causing their symptoms
[1897.44 - 1900.88] to last longer you wouldn't believe it
[1899.52 - 1902.72] you're not going to see it on Instagram
[1900.88 - 1904.76] because Instagram is fantasy land for a
[1902.72 - 1907.60] lot of people not for everybody of
[1904.76 - 1909.52] course you know that's Fantasy Land I
[1907.60 - 1911.04] mean there people don't even people are
[1909.52 - 1912.40] on Instagram some people they don't even
[1911.04 - 1914.28] really telling you what they're really
[1912.40 - 1915.84] eating they tell you and they make it
[1914.28 - 1916.96] look like I'm I'm eating this I'm eating
[1915.84 - 1918.52] this I'm eating this and a lot of people
[1916.96 - 1920.68] are but there's a lot of people that are
[1918.52 - 1922.40] like oh I'm eating this and then they're
[1920.68 - 1924.04] eating pizza on the weekend but they
[1922.40 - 1926.00] don't show that part on
[1924.04 - 1928.68] Instagram and know show that part on
[1926.00 - 1930.28] social media I mean you know of course
[1928.68 - 1931.32] it's they're right they don't have to I
[1930.28 - 1933.92] mean of
[1931.32 - 1935.76] course but you know it's it's it's if
[1933.92 - 1937.24] you're staying diligent and you're doing
[1935.76 - 1939.40] it long enough and you're doing the
[1937.24 - 1941.04] right things and you saturate yourself
[1939.40 - 1943.00] in the medical medium information in the
[1941.04 - 1944.92] series the Timeless information you can
[1943.00 - 1948.20] get rid of your digestive tract problems
[1944.92 - 1949.80] thousands have you can it can be done
[1948.20 - 1951.24] but a lot of people they're up against a
[1949.80 - 1952.76] lot of things a lot more stress some
[1951.24 - 1954.56] people are up against so much stress and
[1952.76 - 1956.00] heartache that their adrenaline is
[1954.56 - 1957.44] running all the time their livers have
[1956.00 - 1959.44] been saturated with it some people are
[1957.44 - 1961.04] more viral they got more bacteria issues
[1959.44 - 1962.08] inside the liver more viruses inside the
[1961.04 - 1963.80] liver some people have done more
[1962.08 - 1965.68] Pharmaceuticals than others like tons of
[1963.80 - 1968.16] Pharmaceuticals anti-depressants you
[1965.68 - 1970.48] name it antibiotics periodically over
[1968.16 - 1972.52] the years and they've done like they've
[1970.48 - 1973.48] done the medications and that's all a
[1972.52 - 1975.84] problem
[1973.48 - 1977.28] too and some people have done all these
[1975.84 - 1979.00] different things and they've they've got
[1977.28 - 1980.48] everybody's different they got things
[1979.00 - 1981.96] different things going on and some
[1980.48 - 1983.92] people had a sluggish liver all the way
[1981.96 - 1985.40] from babyhood and they had baby liver I
[1983.92 - 1987.60] call it baby liver it's inside Liver
[1985.40 - 1989.56] Rescue and you learn all about you know
[1987.60 - 1992.28] children's liver conditions children and
[1989.56 - 1994.00] baby liver and the thing is you have all
[1992.28 - 1995.48] this going on some people are loaded
[1994.00 - 1996.92] with heavy metals inside the liver it's
[1995.48 - 1998.28] actually unbelievable and they got all
[1996.92 - 2000.04] kinds of medications that have heavy
[1998.28 - 2001.32] metals in them and and doctor treatments
[2000.04 - 2003.68] and stuff like that conventional
[2001.32 - 2006.20] doctor's office you name
[2003.68 - 2007.68] it and a lot of people had braces where
[2006.20 - 2009.28] they have the metal brace bra not like
[2007.68 - 2010.52] the invisible line or something not the
[2009.28 - 2013.88] not the whatever they have the metal
[2010.52 - 2015.88] braces and all the metal just oxidized
[2013.88 - 2017.48] you know for 2 years of having braces on
[2015.88 - 2019.08] and it started when you're a child or a
[2017.48 - 2021.16] teenager whatever and it saturated the
[2019.08 - 2022.68] liver and then bloating comes later on
[2021.16 - 2024.08] the metals are in there the steel and
[2022.68 - 2026.08] everything else a stainless steel are
[2024.08 - 2027.64] all feeding they're all feeding
[2026.08 - 2029.04] pathogens and stuff I mean hey no big
[2027.64 - 2030.56] deal you can clean it all up you can
[2029.04 - 2031.68] work on these things but everybody has a
[2030.56 - 2033.64] different story everybody has a
[2031.68 - 2035.80] different thing going on one glass of
[2033.64 - 2037.72] celery juice might fix one person one
[2035.80 - 2039.16] day absolutely one glass of Cellar juice
[2037.72 - 2040.64] is not going to fix another person yet
[2039.16 - 2041.88] and they have to do a lot more besides
[2040.64 - 2043.60] that they have to get all the things
[2041.88 - 2045.48] down they have to saturate themselves in
[2043.60 - 2047.16] in the information to learn how to bring
[2045.48 - 2049.12] back their hydrochloric acid and learn
[2047.16 - 2050.80] how to bring back their bile and learn
[2049.12 - 2053.60] how to heal and learn how to move
[2050.80 - 2057.32] forward and learn how to do
[2053.60 - 2059.88] it it's that important it's that
[2057.32 - 2062.20] important all of it
[2059.88 - 2063.68] matters small intestine isn't able to
[2062.20 - 2065.92] absorb the nutrients it's meant to
[2063.68 - 2069.00] anymore rancid fats line the intestinal
[2065.92 - 2071.08] tract and the colon fats line the gut
[2069.00 - 2072.84] they line the gut and they Harbor
[2071.08 - 2074.60] pathogens but we're told to keep on
[2072.84 - 2076.40] eating protein and we're told to keep on
[2074.60 - 2078.08] eating fat it's
[2076.40 - 2079.92] unbelievable
[2078.08 - 2082.28] unbelievable you don't think you're on a
[2079.92 - 2084.64] high-fat diet you don't you don't think
[2082.28 - 2087.64] you're on a high fat diet huh you're
[2084.64 - 2091.04] wrong you're wrong you're on a high-fat
[2087.64 - 2092.48] diet you are you eat chicken once every
[2091.04 - 2093.76] single day you're on a high fat diet and
[2092.48 - 2096.92] a handful of nuts and you're on a high
[2093.76 - 2098.00] fat diet yeah you can have some chicken
[2096.92 - 2099.24] but if you got problems and you're
[2098.00 - 2100.24] struggling or anything else and there's
[2099.24 - 2101.52] something going on with bloating or
[2100.24 - 2102.76] whatever it's chicken every other day
[2101.52 - 2104.72] you got to take a little break lower the
[2102.76 - 2107.08] fats handful of almonds every other day
[2104.72 - 2109.12] an avocado every other day and bring in
[2107.08 - 2112.00] more leafy greens lots of celery juice
[2109.12 - 2114.60] bring in some potatoes bring in sweet
[2112.00 - 2115.72] potatoes winter squash bringing all
[2114.60 - 2118.84] kinds of different things if you want to
[2115.72 - 2120.28] go raw 100% raw do the 28 day cleanse
[2118.84 - 2122.04] you do the liver cleanse to bring your
[2120.28 - 2124.00] liver back and Li a rescue but you got
[2122.04 - 2125.48] to work on it it's you can do it you can
[2124.00 - 2127.60] heal you can heal
[2125.48 - 2128.92] bloating and sometimes that bloating
[2127.60 - 2130.64] sticks around for a lot of people for
[2128.92 - 2132.92] quite a while cuz the deeper you detox
[2130.64 - 2134.32] the more junk comes out the deeper you
[2132.92 - 2136.00] detox when you start shaking and
[2134.32 - 2137.76] rattling that liver and all that Gunk
[2136.00 - 2139.28] and crap comes out oh my God and it
[2137.76 - 2140.56] comes out it's surfacing and floating
[2139.28 - 2142.44] around and it gets it's in the
[2140.56 - 2144.76] bloodstream and it's floating around
[2142.44 - 2147.20] everywhere that alone can get you to
[2144.76 - 2149.44] bloat a little bit you better believe it
[2147.20 - 2151.56] bloating healing bloating doesn't
[2149.44 - 2153.68] necessarily mean the bloating goes away
[2151.56 - 2156.80] the day you heal
[2153.68 - 2158.48] it you can heal the bloating issue but
[2156.80 - 2160.44] but because you're dumping so much out
[2158.48 - 2161.96] of the liver on a daily basis you're
[2160.44 - 2163.64] going to bloat for a while even after
[2161.96 - 2165.76] your bloating has been
[2163.64 - 2167.16] healed everybody's different with the
[2165.76 - 2168.68] situation everybody's liver is different
[2167.16 - 2170.40] so you got to approach it where okay
[2168.68 - 2172.56] let's start here 16 ounces of celery
[2170.40 - 2173.96] juice let's start right there hey if you
[2172.56 - 2176.24] can handle celery juice and you like
[2173.96 - 2178.40] celery juice do 32 ounces a day watch
[2176.24 - 2180.76] how that really takes it to the next
[2178.40 - 2182.40] level in an amazing way make sure you
[2180.76 - 2184.44] have a fat-free morning no matter what
[2182.40 - 2188.40] every morning is fat
[2184.44 - 2191.32] free 100% fat free 100% what's called
[2188.40 - 2193.28] protein free gotta be careful about that
[2191.32 - 2195.84] because protein means fat in most cases
[2193.28 - 2197.84] in almost all cases and if you're going
[2195.84 - 2199.76] to put a bunch of plant protein like a
[2197.84 - 2203.00] bunch of pea protein in your shake you
[2199.76 - 2206.40] just made yourself a bloating shake my
[2203.00 - 2208.80] God dried peas ground up is that's a
[2206.40 - 2210.32] massive bloater if you don't feel
[2208.80 - 2212.00] bloated after your shake you'll feel
[2210.32 - 2213.48] bloated a week later you won't know what
[2212.00 - 2216.04] it is it's the dried peas you're putting
[2213.48 - 2217.88] in the shake whey protein is really bad
[2216.04 - 2220.04] whey protein powder that's the bloater
[2217.88 - 2222.08] of all bloaters how many people have
[2220.04 - 2224.40] that collagen in shakes that's a bloater
[2222.08 - 2227.04] oh my God the
[2224.40 - 2229.28] bloaters that are in people's shakes too
[2227.04 - 2230.64] all that almond butter all the oh my God
[2229.28 - 2231.84] people put tablespoons of almond butter
[2230.64 - 2234.12] in their shake and they're like well got
[2231.84 - 2235.80] to keep the insulin balance got to keep
[2234.12 - 2237.40] the blood sugar balanc meanwhile you
[2235.80 - 2238.60] just you just totally destroyed your
[2237.40 - 2240.36] blood sugar because you're making
[2238.60 - 2242.48] insulin resistance by making putting all
[2240.36 - 2244.36] that fat inside your shake now if this
[2242.48 - 2246.28] is a foreign land for anybody that's
[2244.36 - 2247.72] listening then you should learn learn
[2246.28 - 2249.24] about the truth and learn about the
[2247.72 - 2252.68] information if you're afraid of it and
[2249.24 - 2255.44] you don't like what I'm saying I'm sorry
[2252.68 - 2259.52] I'm sorry I mean I do
[2255.44 - 2263.44] care I really do care it matters to me
[2259.52 - 2265.60] what happens to you it does if I seem
[2263.44 - 2267.84] insensitive I'm not insensitive to you
[2265.60 - 2270.88] one bit I'm insensitive to the industry
[2267.84 - 2274.20] I'm insensitive to the trends
[2270.88 - 2277.24] Setters the trend setters that that put
[2274.20 - 2279.00] out bogus information
[2277.24 - 2281.48] I'm I'm insensitive to a lot of
[2279.00 - 2283.44] situations out there that get people in
[2281.48 - 2285.48] trouble so they waste another five years
[2283.44 - 2287.52] another eight
[2285.48 - 2288.92] years you know what I suggest with
[2287.52 - 2290.44] people with bloating is to go plant-
[2288.92 - 2291.84] base for a little while in their life if
[2290.44 - 2294.04] they're afraid to they should but they
[2291.84 - 2296.40] should try it they should try it if
[2294.04 - 2298.92] they're big into animal protein go
[2296.40 - 2301.28] plant-based for a little while
[2298.92 - 2303.48] absolutely totally do
[2301.28 - 2305.12] that if you're afraid to keep some
[2303.48 - 2306.68] animal protein in do it at the end of
[2305.12 - 2308.08] the day do your animal protein at the
[2306.68 - 2310.24] end of the day and do it only once a day
[2308.08 - 2313.80] if you can start with that then start
[2310.24 - 2316.20] with that and during the day you got to
[2313.80 - 2319.20] bring in mineral salts and leafy greens
[2316.20 - 2322.32] mineral salts and leafy greens cucumber
[2319.20 - 2324.20] juice celery juice celery juice by
[2322.32 - 2327.00] itself of course you guys know that 16
[2324.20 - 2329.88] ounces on an empty stomach if you can
[2327.00 - 2332.80] salads spinach salads leafy green salads
[2329.88 - 2336.32] lettuce mix butterleaf lettuce red leaf
[2332.80 - 2338.84] lettuce green leaf lettuce Roma bringing
[2336.32 - 2340.48] in the mineral salts spinach bring in
[2338.84 - 2342.88] the mineral salts yeah you might be
[2340.48 - 2344.16] bloated yeah you might be bloated for a
[2342.88 - 2346.80] while absolutely but you know what
[2344.16 - 2349.24] you're doing you're building you're not
[2346.80 - 2351.32] trying to get a Curative power you're
[2349.24 - 2353.16] not trying to get a Curative antidote to
[2351.32 - 2354.64] cure your bloating in that one minute
[2353.16 - 2356.56] because that's ridiculous what you're
[2354.64 - 2358.16] doing is you're going you're doing this
[2356.56 - 2360.24] so the bloating goes away for good
[2358.16 - 2363.88] because your your liver can't Resto
[2360.24 - 2365.76] restore its bio reserves and bio
[2363.88 - 2368.72] production overnight and the people that
[2365.76 - 2371.84] are even eating really good really
[2368.72 - 2373.40] clean even low fat potatoes at night and
[2371.84 - 2375.72] some shakes and you know like some fruit
[2373.40 - 2377.84] fruit in the morning and a salad for
[2375.72 - 2379.32] lunch or whatever they're doing and
[2377.84 - 2381.20] they're still bloating that's cuz the
[2379.32 - 2383.60] liver has that much more healing to do
[2381.20 - 2385.92] there's that much more toxic nature ins
[2383.60 - 2387.76] inside that liver there's that much more
[2385.92 - 2389.32] viruses bacteria inside that liver
[2387.76 - 2391.24] there's that much more trouble inside
[2389.32 - 2394.04] that liver that has to come out and
[2391.24 - 2395.60] toxins and all kinds of stuff and metals
[2394.04 - 2397.00] that's why I like the heavy metal detox
[2395.60 - 2398.68] smoothie
[2397.00 - 2400.32] a medical medium heavy metal detox
[2398.68 - 2402.44] smoothie it's a
[2400.32 - 2404.84] lifesaver because metals have to come
[2402.44 - 2406.96] out of the liver pathogens have to come
[2404.84 - 2409.12] out all of
[2406.96 - 2410.80] that and then it gets and then it gets
[2409.12 - 2413.00] pushed out and it takes time it takes
[2410.80 - 2414.68] time for the bile reserves to rebuild
[2413.00 - 2417.24] some people's bile is weak from the
[2414.68 - 2420.24] beginning in childhood it can't be fixed
[2417.24 - 2422.60] with a glass of celery juice but you got
[2420.24 - 2424.00] to stay on it and work with it and get
[2422.60 - 2425.40] it better you'll notice the bloating
[2424.00 - 2426.72] getting better over time and it gets
[2425.40 - 2428.32] better and better and better stronger
[2426.72 - 2431.00] and then the liver wants to repair other
[2428.32 - 2432.52] things sometimes it doesn't fix the bile
[2431.00 - 2434.56] problem yet because you're actually
[2432.52 - 2436.12] helping it to stop greater and bigger
[2434.56 - 2437.88] problems that were occurring that you
[2436.12 - 2442.12] didn't even know that could lead to
[2437.88 - 2445.12] disease down the road when you're 60 70
[2442.12 - 2446.68] 50 40 whatever it is and your liver is
[2445.12 - 2448.20] working on things by taking the
[2446.68 - 2449.64] nutrients and taking the foods and
[2448.20 - 2451.96] taking the advantage of having you do
[2449.64 - 2454.32] low protein and low fats by taking the
[2451.96 - 2456.36] advantage of doing that and then re
[2454.32 - 2458.76] reestablishing itself healing itself
[2456.36 - 2461.12] rebuilding areas of it that it produces
[2458.76 - 2462.96] hormones areas that it produces enzymes
[2461.12 - 2464.72] areas that it produces Miracle chemical
[2462.96 - 2466.44] functions that keep you alive to protect
[2464.72 - 2468.00] your heart to protect your brain all
[2466.44 - 2469.76] these things it does that's also
[2468.00 - 2471.92] weakening that bile is the last thing
[2469.76 - 2473.64] it's got to worry about sometimes so let
[2471.92 - 2475.68] it be rancid fats going down your gut
[2473.64 - 2477.28] lining Let It Be rancid proteins going
[2475.68 - 2479.40] down your gut lining because the liver
[2477.28 - 2480.60] is more important fish to fry sometimes
[2479.40 - 2482.32] so it's got to protect you if you're
[2480.60 - 2484.64] really that bad with your liver over the
[2482.32 - 2486.00] years and you don't need liver enzyme
[2484.64 - 2487.96] tests that the doctor's office tell you
[2486.00 - 2489.56] you got a problem believe me because
[2487.96 - 2492.64] those things that's not even I got a
[2489.56 - 2494.60] whole chapter on that in in Li rescue
[2492.64 - 2497.32] right here and there's listen I can't
[2494.60 - 2500.04] cover this book in these radio shows I
[2497.32 - 2501.88] could only cover a little bit so if if
[2500.04 - 2503.32] you're even a fraction interested in
[2501.88 - 2505.16] what I have to say no matter what just
[2503.32 - 2507.68] get the books and and really crack into
[2505.16 - 2511.32] them just crack into them a chapter at a
[2507.68 - 2513.68] time before bed just a chapter at a time
[2511.32 - 2515.32] before bed you'll get nooks and crannies
[2513.68 - 2516.88] and gems and jewels and you get things
[2515.32 - 2519.52] that are really tasty and they'll help
[2516.88 - 2521.76] you they'll help you there's some tasty
[2519.52 - 2523.68] pieces in here you just got to look for
[2521.76 - 2526.72] them you got to look for them they're
[2523.68 - 2529.04] all in there here's the deal here's the
[2526.72 - 2532.24] deal let's talk about a couple of things
[2529.04 - 2534.76] people do nutritional yeast disastrous
[2532.24 - 2537.40] disastrous there's glutamic acid in all
[2534.76 - 2539.84] nutritional yeast absolutely
[2537.40 - 2541.56] disastrous and that's hard on the liver
[2539.84 - 2543.08] I'm just being straight up so you'll get
[2541.56 - 2544.48] these people and they'll be like you
[2543.08 - 2545.76] know they'll be on social media whatever
[2544.48 - 2547.20] and they're doing all this stuff they're
[2545.76 - 2549.80] like why isn't the medical medium
[2547.20 - 2552.08] protocol helping me uh well first of all
[2549.80 - 2554.20] there is no real medical medium protocol
[2552.08 - 2555.96] per se there's just the information
[2554.20 - 2557.76] that's Timeless in the books for every
[2555.96 - 2559.40] single Walk of Life depending on where
[2557.76 - 2561.92] they are meaning wherever they're at
[2559.40 - 2563.88] meeting them at in their health and
[2561.92 - 2565.80] their Health crisis on every level
[2563.88 - 2568.36] there's something in EV in these books
[2565.80 - 2571.68] for everyone to heal with and heal from
[2568.36 - 2574.00] with and move forward with because not
[2571.68 - 2576.84] one size fits all that's what the
[2574.00 - 2579.00] medical medium protocol is
[2576.84 - 2580.88] not one size fits all and then you'll
[2579.00 - 2582.56] hear this person say oh well you know
[2580.88 - 2584.36] meanwhile thousands of people I mean are
[2582.56 - 2586.32] they're they're walking now they get
[2584.36 - 2587.88] their anxiety gone they're healing their
[2586.32 - 2589.48] guts their gut is better they got the
[2587.88 - 2591.24] rid of their Lyme disease all these
[2589.48 - 2592.76] amazing things and then you get somebody
[2591.24 - 2594.20] they're eating nutritional yeast and lot
[2592.76 - 2595.72] of nutritional yeast they gobbling it
[2594.20 - 2597.80] down they have to have nutritional yeast
[2595.72 - 2599.96] every single day with all that glutamic
[2597.80 - 2601.20] acid totally saturating the liver and
[2599.96 - 2603.16] they're wondering why their bloating is
[2601.20 - 2606.96] not going
[2603.16 - 2609.48] away and then you have and then you have
[2606.96 - 2611.44] somebody who's doing the apple cider
[2609.48 - 2613.60] vinegar the apple cider vinegar will
[2611.44 - 2615.88] make you get bloated vinegar is it
[2613.60 - 2617.76] pickles the liver it's the worst thing
[2615.88 - 2619.08] ever yeah I know apple cider vinegar is
[2617.76 - 2620.68] better than all the other vinegars I'm
[2619.08 - 2622.52] not doubting that it's actually good for
[2620.68 - 2625.28] your scalp too it's good for other it's
[2622.52 - 2626.92] good for your skin to treat your skin
[2625.28 - 2629.36] terrible for your liver internally when
[2626.92 - 2630.92] you consume it but that'll that'll
[2629.36 - 2632.48] weaken your liver weaken your bile
[2630.92 - 2634.16] weaken your hydrochloric acid destroy
[2632.48 - 2637.68] your hydrochloric
[2634.16 - 2639.36] acid that acidic nature vinegar destroys
[2637.68 - 2641.48] hydrochloric acid hydrochloric acid in
[2639.36 - 2644.16] your stomach can only rebuild through
[2641.48 - 2647.76] mineral salts that are
[2644.16 - 2650.72] alkaline in nature both on the back and
[2647.76 - 2653.04] on the front that means even if apple
[2650.72 - 2655.80] cider vinegar has an alkalinizing kind
[2653.04 - 2658.84] of effect in some way internally what it
[2655.80 - 2662.48] is it's completely acidic in its worst
[2658.84 - 2665.00] way and mineral salts are not they're
[2662.48 - 2668.32] never acidic in any way back or front of
[2665.00 - 2670.84] it on a on a on on an Alchemy level you
[2668.32 - 2672.56] know the bottom line is you just hurt
[2670.84 - 2675.28] your liver and you get you get
[2672.56 - 2677.20] bloated so what's behind bloating like
[2675.28 - 2680.00] I'm saying what's the other things when
[2677.20 - 2682.00] the bloating occurs it starts to happen
[2680.00 - 2685.08] part of bloating is the gut coping with
[2682.00 - 2687.28] poorly digested food another part is
[2685.08 - 2691.84] when the liver is unhappy and stagnant
[2687.28 - 2694.76] to the point of lower bioproduction
[2691.84 - 2696.68] right yeah it means that it's also
[2694.76 - 2699.40] overburdened with toxic materials like I
[2696.68 - 2702.00] was saying leeching out into the bile so
[2699.40 - 2706.88] they end up back in your intestinal
[2702.00 - 2709.88] tract how do you like them apples you
[2706.88 - 2711.52] guys the bile gets filled with metals
[2709.88 - 2714.44] and everything else from the inside of
[2711.52 - 2716.68] the intestinal track drives right up
[2714.44 - 2718.04] into the gut drops into your gut again
[2716.68 - 2720.84] gets
[2718.04 - 2724.64] reabsorbed really a difficult
[2720.84 - 2727.24] situation it is there's so much
[2724.64 - 2729.96] there and means that it's overburdened
[2727.24 - 2732.56] with toxic materials and as they leech
[2729.96 - 2734.44] on out into the bile they end up back in
[2732.56 - 2736.60] the intestinal tract they're being
[2734.44 - 2740.08] excreted from the bottom of the liver
[2736.60 - 2743.52] off so floating down saturating
[2740.08 - 2746.36] lymphatic vessels around the colon and
[2743.52 - 2750.40] absorbing it into the
[2746.36 - 2752.64] colon bacterian viruses waste matter old
[2750.40 - 2755.04] viral casings from Epstein bar and
[2752.64 - 2757.00] sticky jelly like sludge produced by
[2755.04 - 2759.84] toxins combined with
[2757.00 - 2763.60] pathogens that's among the materials
[2759.84 - 2767.24] that can bleed into the intestinal
[2763.60 - 2768.84] tract oxidative runoff everything all of
[2767.24 - 2770.84] these things coat the lining of the
[2768.84 - 2773.52] small intestinal tract and
[2770.84 - 2775.20] colon causing more bloating and it
[2773.52 - 2778.60] hampers everything it hampers good
[2775.20 - 2782.04] bacteria that we need it feeds bad
[2778.60 - 2784.72] bacteria it feeds unproductive
[2782.04 - 2786.80] microorganisms ultimately I swear it can
[2784.72 - 2789.20] get to the point where the overgrowth of
[2786.80 - 2792.04] strep which causes sibo which is in the
[2789.20 - 2795.60] subtitle of the book Liver Rescue to
[2792.04 - 2797.80] develop strep flourishes and pockets of
[2795.60 - 2801.60] the intestinal
[2797.80 - 2804.36] tract it just creates gas more bloating
[2801.60 - 2806.04] more intestinal problems almost
[2804.36 - 2808.56] everybody has
[2806.04 - 2812.92] sibo that's the irony they don't need to
[2808.56 - 2815.12] get a diagnosis of it lower lower bio
[2812.92 - 2818.72] and lower hydrochloric acid production
[2815.12 - 2822.20] undigested food debris all of this fats
[2818.72 - 2824.80] and proteins undigested and constantly
[2822.20 - 2826.44] being thrown inside the B the bowels
[2824.80 - 2829.40] every day with their
[2826.44 - 2831.76] diet ultimately feeds the pathogens
[2829.40 - 2833.04] whether you're vegan vegetarian or
[2831.76 - 2835.92] animal-based
[2833.04 - 2837.72] diets someone said hey you're just
[2835.92 - 2842.36] you're just you're all about the vegans
[2837.72 - 2844.92] you you're all what do you mean I am
[2842.36 - 2846.20] since when and you're you're all about
[2844.92 - 2848.36] the and someone said you're all about
[2846.20 - 2850.80] the meat eaters the plant-based PE I
[2848.36 - 2852.32] mean the the the Paleo people you're all
[2850.80 - 2856.04] into that right you're you're against
[2852.32 - 2858.52] veganism I am what do you mean I've seen
[2856.04 - 2860.60] I've seen plant-based diets save people
[2858.52 - 2863.04] from
[2860.60 - 2865.20] Death I've offered plant-based diets
[2863.04 - 2867.32] that have saved people from dying it's
[2865.20 - 2870.04] one of the most powerful ways to heal I
[2867.32 - 2871.48] don't care what anybody says you better
[2870.04 - 2874.20] believe
[2871.48 - 2876.52] it and I've seen paleo diets and high
[2874.20 - 2878.08] protein diets PE keep people people from
[2876.52 - 2881.56] eating too
[2878.08 - 2883.44] stupid keeps them from eating like crazy
[2881.56 - 2885.68] pizza every day keeps them from eating
[2883.44 - 2887.64] whatever it keeps them from eating you
[2885.68 - 2889.80] know gluten every day and whatnot and
[2887.64 - 2891.40] and it it keeps them balanced in certain
[2889.80 - 2892.92] ways they see to keep people balanced so
[2891.40 - 2894.36] they actually have a rhythm because they
[2892.92 - 2895.68] just love animal protein so you can't
[2894.36 - 2897.64] take animal protein away you never be
[2895.68 - 2899.16] able to take it away so you want to
[2897.64 - 2900.72] support it of course and if they eat it
[2899.16 - 2902.16] in a certain way if you guys like animal
[2900.72 - 2903.96] protein there's a way of eating it and
[2902.16 - 2905.72] still recover and there's also a way of
[2903.96 - 2908.04] eating it and still get all those other
[2905.72 - 2912.24] things you
[2908.04 - 2913.80] need yeah I've seen it help keeps people
[2912.24 - 2915.68] off of processed foods it keeps people
[2913.80 - 2917.32] from eating worse things but yet sure
[2915.68 - 2919.76] all the high protein diets are still bad
[2917.32 - 2921.12] you just got to lower lower the fats and
[2919.76 - 2923.08] lower the proteins and you could still
[2921.12 - 2924.36] have some animal products all the vegans
[2923.08 - 2925.84] you got to lower the nuts and seeds
[2924.36 - 2928.28] lower the coconut oils lower all the
[2925.84 - 2930.24] almond butter lower all the the avocado
[2928.28 - 2931.76] and the other oils and and seeds and
[2930.24 - 2934.12] everything you got to lower those down
[2931.76 - 2936.00] too it's not that I'm against anything
[2934.12 - 2937.80] or paleo or vegan it's it's just you
[2936.00 - 2940.40] know what I'm against I'm against
[2937.80 - 2944.00] killing your liver with fats no matter
[2940.40 - 2946.16] what aisle you sit on how about
[2944.00 - 2947.88] that you got to watch out for ammonia
[2946.16 - 2949.08] permeability that's something that I
[2947.88 - 2951.12] brought to the world ammonia
[2949.08 - 2952.52] permeability doesn't exist that science
[2951.12 - 2954.28] research does even know about it Le it's
[2952.52 - 2956.68] not leaky gut it's ammonia permeability
[2954.28 - 2958.88] rotting rotting food leaking out an
[2956.68 - 2960.32] ammonia gas that actually doesn't cause
[2958.88 - 2963.32] leaky gut but it travels everywhere
[2960.32 - 2965.64] through the body it's
[2963.32 - 2968.92] ghostlike don't confuse that with leaky
[2965.64 - 2971.32] gut that's just old old
[2968.92 - 2973.44] news old
[2971.32 - 2975.44] misinformation so it's important to know
[2973.44 - 2979.64] all these different
[2975.44 - 2982.92] things so the bottom line is bloating
[2979.64 - 2984.60] cramping discomfort distension all Rises
[2982.92 - 2987.68] up from the gut into your stomach
[2984.60 - 2990.16] contributing to further further
[2987.68 - 2992.32] diminishment of hydrochloric acid and
[2990.16 - 2994.00] reserves stomach GLS
[2992.32 - 2997.04] weaken
[2994.00 - 2999.76] everything bacteria like H pylori
[2997.04 - 3003.08] proliferate in the environment strappy
[2999.76 - 3006.60] coli ulcers can happen
[3003.08 - 3008.68] staff all of it can prosper even candida
[3006.60 - 3010.36] even though candida isn't a problem
[3008.68 - 3013.08] there's other fungus that is a problem
[3010.36 - 3015.76] though there's bad fungus that people
[3013.08 - 3017.12] get so the bottom line is undigested
[3015.76 - 3018.72] protein doesn't break down right
[3017.12 - 3021.28] undigested fat doesn't break down
[3018.72 - 3025.00] dangerous funguses viruses everything
[3021.28 - 3026.48] can sit inside the gut and produce
[3025.00 - 3028.36] poison
[3026.48 - 3031.00] and sit inside the liver producing
[3028.36 - 3033.20] poison so you keep on
[3031.00 - 3034.96] bloating and if you haven't bloated yet
[3033.20 - 3037.64] in your
[3034.96 - 3039.16] life protect yourself now get your diet
[3037.64 - 3040.60] good pick up the books get the
[3039.16 - 3042.28] information saturate yourself in the
[3040.60 - 3045.00] information can't afford books go to the
[3042.28 - 3046.88] library get the information get it
[3045.00 - 3049.12] because you're going to bloat down the
[3046.88 - 3051.24] road because inevitably you're going to
[3049.12 - 3054.52] eat wrong and you have been eating wrong
[3051.24 - 3056.00] in some way some some some some way this
[3054.52 - 3058.52] isn't about food
[3056.00 - 3060.60] shaming you're talking to a guy that
[3058.52 - 3061.52] gives you permission to eat fruit for
[3060.60 - 3064.64] God's
[3061.52 - 3066.92] sake okay what about all the elimination

[3091.56 - 3095.40] very thing that feeds every pathogen in
[3093.28 - 3097.68] the world that gets people sick and gets
[3095.40 - 3100.04] their liver sick in the worst way that's
[3097.68 - 3102.36] that's that's food shaming that's that's

[3174.32 - 3179.32] about that bringing in bananas bringing
[3176.92 - 3181.84] in potatoes I'm one of the biggest
[3179.32 - 3184.28] Advocate biggest Advocate supporters of
[3181.84 - 3186.24] potatoes because potatoes heal you know
[3184.28 - 3187.76] what they do they actually feed your
[3186.24 - 3189.60] liver glucose and feed your brain
[3187.76 - 3192.48] glucose they keep your brain from
[3189.60 - 3195.40] shrinking potatoes keep your liver from
[3192.48 - 3199.32] dying potatoes have amino acids in it to
[3195.40 - 3201.92] kill Epstein bar
[3199.32 - 3204.24] virus potatoes are that powerful that
[3201.92 - 3205.68] antiviral that antibacterial and science
[3204.24 - 3207.92] and research doesn't have a
[3205.68 - 3209.48] clue and all the different communities
[3207.92 - 3211.96] including the new letin community and
[3209.48 - 3214.44] everything else has no clue you know I
[3211.96 - 3215.76] opened up a lecture years ago I opened
[3214.44 - 3218.36] it up saying we've been tricked we've
[3215.76 - 3221.40] been fooled we've been tricked we've
[3218.36 - 3222.44] been fooled we've been duped we've been
[3221.40 - 3225.40] taken
[3222.44 - 3228.60] for that's right the wool has been
[3225.40 - 3232.00] pulled over our eyes that's right you
[3228.60 - 3234.24] name it and it happens over and over and
[3232.00 - 3236.00] over again and we live our life and
[3234.24 - 3237.92] generations with misinformation and
[3236.00 - 3239.60] lectin is a new one and we live our life
[3237.92 - 3241.76] with
[3239.60 - 3244.12] misinformation and all that does is feed
[3241.76 - 3246.60] Empires you guys don't even know
[3244.12 - 3249.76] about it feeds
[3246.60 - 3253.16] Empires it feeds Empires people making 5
[3249.76 - 3254.68] million a month on on misinformation
[3253.16 - 3257.12] that they're feeding the feeding every
[3254.68 - 3259.96] the masses it's
[3257.12 - 3261.48] unbelievable yeah and like I said I'll
[3259.96 - 3262.88] remind you one thing about celery juice
[3261.48 - 3264.20] spirit and I brought celery juice to the
[3262.88 - 3266.40] world straight celery juice we didn't
[3264.20 - 3268.60] create celery
[3266.40 - 3270.60] but we brought celery juice to the world
[3268.60 - 3273.68] okay and the only science that research
[3270.60 - 3275.44] to back it is spirit and all the con
[3273.68 - 3276.96] took a trend to such a degree all the
