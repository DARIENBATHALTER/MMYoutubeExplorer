you don't have the MN 1500 hands down

5
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:15,400
the MN 1500 saves people money now I'm

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
watching out there all the time I'm just

7
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:19,000
going to say this the juicers that are

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,519
getting popular because they got money

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,680
behind them and advertising and

10
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:24,480
influencers behind them those juicers

11
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,279
they don't squeeze enough juice out of

12
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,439
the produce and so essentially you're

13
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:30,240
throwing away money and people who are

14
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:31,880
chronically sick are trying to juice

15
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,760
every day people in the medical mem

16
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:36,920
Community who juice a ton of stuff they

17
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:40,160
can't just be buying cases and cases of

18
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,440
produce juicing it and having not the

19
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,920
results because you're not getting

20
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,360
enough nutrients extracted from the

21
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:47,280
juice it's not actually doing its job to

22
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,640
get the juice out and they're throwing

23
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,520
away produce all that leftover pulp is

24
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:54,079
getting thrown away that's what I love

25
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,760
about the mm 1500 the 900 this is the mm

26
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,640
1500 right here you guys know I work

27
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,000
with the mega link is in the description

28
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:02,920
links in the profile but we're talking

29
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,840
today about eating to protect your liver

30
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:08,520
what people don't realize they have

31
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:11,400
overburdened stagnant sluggish hot

32
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,920
livers that are filled with fat the

33
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,119
livers get dysfunctional and then your

34
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:17,119
cholesterol gets out of whack everything

35
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,759
else gets out of whack deficiencies

36
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,960
start to happen because your liver is

37
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:23,479
the great converter so what happens with

38
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,119
people's livers is that they actually

39
00:01:23,479 --> 00:01:28,079
burden them and they don't realize they

40
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:29,560
burden them so they overburden livers

41
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:31,520
every single day and that's what we're

42
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:33,240
kind of taught we're not taught how to

43
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,920
protect our liver how to look after our

44
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,680
liver how to get our liver in a better

45
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,200
place and then over time our liver stops

46
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,920
working the way it should work it

47
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:42,360
doesn't produce enough bile and when

48
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,360
that bile isn't produced we get in

49
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,759
trouble and all that fat sits around it

50
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,079
doesn't break down good enough it sits

51
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,960
around in our bloodstream then it

52
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:50,759
eventually collects in Our arteries then

53
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,640
it collects in our veins and over time

54
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:55,040
we get problems where we have all this

55
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,320
plaque jacked up all around our blood

56
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,079
vessels veins arteries our liver gets

57
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:01,000
sluggish another thing too you go to the

58
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:02,840
doctor doctor takes blood work the blood

59
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,920
work comes back you're deficient in this

60
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,159
you're deficient in that you're

61
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,080
deficient in this and all these

62
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:09,759
deficiencies over time partly happen

63
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,280
because your liver is the great

64
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:15,959
converter what it does is it actually

65
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:18,360
converts the nutrients and we don't have

66
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:20,560
good livers these days so we don't get

67
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:23,440
good conversion because you want good

68
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:26,560
conversion every single nutrient you eat

69
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,280
almost every single nutrient you eat

70
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,840
nutrients that come from your leafy

71
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:32,239
greens nutrients that come from your

72
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,280
onions your broccoli your radishes your

73
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,360
carrots everything your lemons your

74
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:38,920
limes your Tomatoes your avocados all

75
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,680
those nutrients have to be converted

76
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:42,760
they go into the liver boom they go up

77
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,519
the hepatic portal highway right into

78
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:47,519
the liver here and when that happens

79
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,080
your liver says whoa It's conversion

80
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,800
time so your liver has to anoint and

81
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,800
bless the nutrients is what it has to do

82
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,319
and people don't realize this they think

83
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,920
that if you take a whole bunch of

84
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:59,840
supplements the supplements are going to

85
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,920
work for you you take a whole bunch of

86
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,800
different things are going to work for

87
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:05,080
you and partially that partially that's

88
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:08,319
true but your liver still has to

89
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:11,799
methylate it still has to convert it

90
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:14,040
still has to anoint and turn and change

91
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:16,360
the nutrients around around a little bit

92
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:19,120
it has to bless them enzymes from the

93
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:22,400
liver attach to the nutrients carry the

94
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,920
nutrients along change the nutrients too

95
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,760
and then the liver has to store the

96
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,480
nutrients at the same time but if we

97
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:30,400
overburden we beat down our livers we

98
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,959
drink alcohol we do all kinds of stuff

99
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:36,080
we eat really greasy food fried foods we

100
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:38,480
eat too much oil in everything we get in

101
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:41,400
trouble the liver ends up weakening and

102
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,519
when it weakens it can't convert so we

103
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,239
walk around our liver's getting tired

104
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,640
it's getting stagnant it's getting

105
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:49,840
sluggish and then it's not doing its job

106
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:52,840
every day and then we go to bed at night

107
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:55,799
and our liver is tired it's too tired to

108
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:57,480
work hard for us all night long so what

109
00:03:55,799 --> 00:04:00,560
happens when you go to bed at night your

110
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:04,040
liver starts to work that's when it

111
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:06,560
clocks in mainly clocks in in the middle

112
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:09,280
of the night that's where it starts to

113
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,560
bag up all the garbage all the junk all

114
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,040
the toxins all the poisons they get

115
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:15,799
bagged up in the middle of the night and

116
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,919
you got to keep that in mind right so

117
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:20,359
when we sleep our liver working while

118
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:22,960
we're resting that's how it works our

119
00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:24,600
liers working while we're resting think

120
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,160
about a whole bunch of elves inside your

121
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,080
liver and they're making all kinds of

122
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,120
toys and they're doing all kinds of

123
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,479
stuff and they're using Hammers and saws

124
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:35,680
they're working all night long while

125
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:37,919
you're sleeping and resting but when our

126
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,720
livers get tired and they get beat up

127
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:42,199
and they get overburdened and they get

128
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:44,120
fatty and they start to get sluggish and

129
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:46,639
stagnant when they work in the middle of

130
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:49,440
the night they're not as efficient our

131
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:51,240
livers are not as working as they should

132
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,000
or efficient as they should so in the

133
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,720
middle of the night we sit there and

134
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,759
sometimes people toss and turntime

135
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,440
sometimes people have more gas sometimes

136
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:59,800
people have they're waking up in the

137
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,919
middle of the night sometimes times

138
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,199
people don't feel good when they're

139
00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:04,000
trying to sleep they're tossing and

140
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:06,720
turning and a lot of that is liver

141
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,880
spasming out so people get liver spasms

142
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,919
they don't even know it a lot of people

143
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,680
and inside their body they got an

144
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:16,120
unhappy liver every single day that

145
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,800
wants to perform that wants to move

146
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:21,600
forward that wants to heal that wants to

147
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,759
get better but it just can't do what it

148
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,960
needs to do let's make some garbanzo

149
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:28,000
bean hummus so what I have right here is

150
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,680
a bowl of chickpeas garbanzo beans and

151
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,759
I'm going to make hummus I'm going to

152
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,960
make it without using Sesame tahini I'm

153
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,880
not going to use a whole bunch of tahini

154
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,880
in here I'm not not going to dump a

155
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:40,240
whole bunch of olive oil in here either

156
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:41,880
this is easier food on the liver that's

157
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,880
what this is so what you see is sesame

158
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:47,759
seeds take a look you can get the flavor

159
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:50,280
of Sesame in your hummus without

160
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:52,360
burdening the liver with too much oil

161
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:54,280
too much tahini you don't need to do

162
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:57,039
that you can make a hummus and just use

163
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:58,919
some sesame seeds in here get it ground

164
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,600
up all the same in there that's that's

165
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:02,319
the difference so let's go let's drop

166
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,520
some of these garbanzo beans in here

167
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:07,560
right here you can make hummus without

168
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:10,080
olive oil without tahini I got some

169
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:13,520
garbanzos coming through you realize

170
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:16,240
like how very little this is a handful

171
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:18,599
of sesame seeds much different than a

172
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,160
tablespoon of tahini in somebody's

173
00:06:18,599 --> 00:06:23,800
hummus right this is a basic hummus you

174
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:25,639
don't have to go too crazy I got a lemon

175
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,280
squeezing the lemon right in here there

176
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:29,520
we go let me show you right here that's

177
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:32,000
hummus and there isn't a tablespoon of

178
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:34,479
oil there's not a tablespoon of olive

179
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,440
oil there isn't a tablespoon of tahini

180
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:39,479
in here it's easy on the liver so I'm

181
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:42,800
just mixing this up there we go back to

182
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:46,759
the crud this time it's with hummus made
