[52.00 - 58.48] because everybody
[54.24 - 60.80] looks in the toilet after they go
[58.48 - 62.00] very few people on the planet
[60.80 - 63.76] don't look
[62.00 - 66.00] behind them
[63.76 - 67.92] after they've gone okay
[66.00 - 70.56] everybody looks that's what they do they

[74.00 - 78.08] and so what happens is that
[76.16 - 79.60] like poops everything to everybody for
[78.08 - 81.20] so many reasons you know we don't talk
[79.60 - 83.28] about it we don't want to talk about it
[81.20 - 85.28] we're embarrassed to talk about it
[83.28 - 87.68] at the same time every time you go to
[85.28 - 89.20] your doctor physician your your health
[87.68 - 91.12] care provider whatever it is they're
[89.20 - 93.12] always asking questions people are
[91.12 - 94.64] always concerned their stomach problems
[93.12 - 96.08] everything else so it's kind of
[94.64 - 98.00] important in so many different ways good
[96.08 - 99.44] to see you guys coming on we're live
[98.00 - 101.44] right now this is kind of part of the
[99.44 - 102.32] poop-a-thon i promised you guys so this
[101.44 - 105.68] is
[102.32 - 108.08] an episode on poop so let's get started
[105.68 - 109.52] okay so
[108.08 - 110.96] what i love
[109.52 - 112.16] okay
[110.96 - 115.20] is
[112.16 - 117.36] questions that are well that's not what
[115.20 - 118.64] i learned in school aw hey that's not
[117.36 - 120.56] what i learned
[118.64 - 122.48] or that's not what i learned in training
[120.56 - 124.32] or that's not what i was taught in the
[122.48 - 126.24] medical field don't listen to this man
[124.32 - 128.08] because he doesn't know anything
[126.24 - 129.44] and you know that's i love when that
[128.08 - 130.56] happens because i see that happen all
[129.44 - 131.92] the time right it doesn't matter how
[130.56 - 133.92] many people got better at medical mean
[131.92 - 135.44] information doesn't matter the medical
[133.92 - 137.76] medium information it's the first in
[135.44 - 139.68] chronic illness to change the rules out
[137.76 - 141.44] there where people are healing
[139.68 - 143.12] rapidly all around the world that
[141.44 - 144.96] doesn't matter not of that right just
[143.12 - 146.48] know um you learn something about poop
[144.96 - 147.68] that's misinformation you hold on to
[146.48 - 150.16] that for the rest of your life and you
[147.68 - 152.48] think you're you're solid
[150.16 - 154.64] so the point is is that questions come
[152.48 - 157.92] about and it's like okay
[154.64 - 160.32] i always heard that when a poop floats
[157.92 - 161.68] then you're in trouble a healthy poop
[160.32 - 164.88] sinks
[161.68 - 166.24] that's what people say a healthy poop
[164.88 - 169.04] sinks
[166.24 - 170.96] up unhealthy poop
[169.04 - 173.84] floats right so that's what people are
[170.96 - 175.60] trained to think or trained to know
[173.84 - 179.28] but you got to think about i said this
[175.60 - 182.00] before all the people dying
[179.28 - 182.96] all the hospitals filled with very ill
[182.00 - 186.72] people
[182.96 - 188.96] okay and their poops all sink
[186.72 - 190.96] there's people that are dying
[188.96 - 193.68] only got a couple weeks to live
[190.96 - 194.96] and their poops are sinking
[193.68 - 197.76] so
[194.96 - 200.16] it's not that the person's poop is
[197.76 - 202.40] perfectly healthy and fine but they're
[200.16 - 204.88] gonna die in two weeks
[202.40 - 206.96] so they're unhealthy they're obviously
[204.88 - 209.84] dying they're very ill
[206.96 - 211.28] okay but their poop is healthy
[209.84 - 213.44] everything about their poop is healthy
[211.28 - 214.80] it sinks it's healthy you got to think
[213.44 - 216.96] about that for a minute there right
[214.80 - 219.52] understand what that means
[216.96 - 220.88] and how it works okay sun moon love says
[219.52 - 221.76] still hungry from your other life i
[220.88 - 223.68] don't know if you're gonna be hungry
[221.76 - 226.40] anymore because we're talking about poop
[223.68 - 228.16] but it was really an incredible live so
[226.40 - 229.52] anyway the amazon live you guys got to
[228.16 - 232.00] catch it when you get the chance and you
[229.52 - 235.04] can if you just so you know we did a
[232.00 - 237.20] killer like game day prepared for you
[235.04 - 238.88] know we did a seven layer dip and
[237.20 - 240.16] buffalo wings and everything you guys
[238.88 - 241.60] got gotta check out that amazon live
[240.16 - 243.52] when you get a chance the link is in the
[241.60 - 246.72] description link is in the profile so
[243.52 - 249.20] it's like a super bowl meal i made so
[246.72 - 250.88] and healthy too is cauliflower that's
[249.20 - 252.96] incredible cauliflower bites buffalo
[250.88 - 254.56] cauliflower bites you gotta check it out
[252.96 - 256.16] so
[254.56 - 257.44] so right now we're talking about
[256.16 - 259.44] poop i'm glad you guys are coming on
[257.44 - 261.76] good to see everybody all right so what
[259.44 - 263.84] happens is the misinformation is really
[261.76 - 265.68] rampant out there about poop
[263.84 - 266.72] you can have people dying
[265.68 - 269.20] sick
[266.72 - 270.96] real sick all kinds of problems in their
[269.20 - 272.48] intestinal tract all kinds of different
[270.96 - 273.84] disorders different conditions and their
[272.48 - 275.12] poop will sink
[273.84 - 277.20] it'll sink
[275.12 - 279.04] it will and that's what happens and
[277.20 - 280.64] people don't realize this
[279.04 - 283.20] michael scoots good to see people don't
[280.64 - 286.40] realize this that that's what happens
[283.20 - 288.08] and so you can what i talk to nurses all
[286.40 - 289.44] through the years i've talked to doctors
[288.08 - 290.88] and they'll tell you i know like i was
[289.44 - 292.64] talking about this in amazon life friend
[290.88 - 293.68] of mine is an emergency room doctor
[292.64 - 295.84] right
[293.68 - 298.16] and he's dealing with the sickest people
[295.84 - 299.92] on the planet rolling in just rolling in
[298.16 - 301.68] right deathly ill
[299.92 - 304.08] their poop sinks
[301.68 - 305.76] so now the person's sick
[304.08 - 307.84] the person's dying
[305.76 - 308.84] the person has organ failure but their
[307.84 - 311.20] poops are
[308.84 - 312.56] healthy does that make any sense to you
[311.20 - 314.88] it doesn't make any sense that's the
[312.56 - 316.64] whole point now think about this
[314.88 - 321.40] millions of people
[316.64 - 321.40] in the u.s alone over 275
[321.76 - 326.72] million americans are sick
[324.40 - 326.72] yes
[327.00 - 334.48] 275 million americans are sick you guys
[331.68 - 337.68] with symptoms and conditions
[334.48 - 338.56] some gravely sick some just moderately
[337.68 - 341.60] sick
[338.56 - 342.88] some partly sick and their poop all
[341.60 - 345.12] sinks
[342.88 - 348.48] i don't think
[345.12 - 349.68] we can just confidently say
[348.48 - 351.60] right
[349.68 - 352.88] that if a poop sinks it's great and
[351.60 - 354.28] that's what we've been taught you got to
[352.88 - 356.72] think about that
[354.28 - 359.12] 275 million americans alone i'm not good
[356.72 - 361.36] about worldwide
[359.12 - 363.12] billions of people on the planet their
[361.36 - 364.64] poop sinks
[363.12 - 366.40] billions are sick with symptoms and
[364.64 - 367.76] conditions so we have to we have to kind
[366.40 - 370.00] of like take a look at that to begin
[367.76 - 371.60] with and see how that works and nothing
[370.00 - 374.08] makes sense holly's health says nothing
[371.60 - 375.92] in the medical system makes sense true
[374.08 - 377.28] very little does
[375.92 - 381.04] so let's get into this a little bit so
[377.28 - 382.56] here's the deal if your poop floats
[381.04 - 384.88] that means you must have pancreatic
[382.56 - 386.08] cancer that means you're not digesting
[384.88 - 387.92] your fats
[386.08 - 389.76] that means it must be all fat in your
[387.92 - 390.56] poop right that's the misinformation so
[389.76 - 392.16] that's the part that's the
[390.56 - 393.52] misinformation
[392.16 - 394.56] okay
[393.52 - 397.28] right
[394.56 - 398.16] so that's that part there is wait a
[397.28 - 401.84] minute
[398.16 - 403.04] if your poop floats you're sick
[401.84 - 404.88] you're sick
[403.04 - 406.00] it's interesting someone dying in the
[404.88 - 407.84] hospital
[406.00 - 409.92] organ failure and every other problem
[407.84 - 411.36] right really sick on tons of medications
[409.92 - 414.24] everything else their poop sinks to the
[411.36 - 416.24] bottom of the toilet they're not sick
[414.24 - 418.00] someone who doesn't exhibit one symptom
[416.24 - 419.92] their poop floats all of a sudden
[418.00 - 422.56] they're the one dying
[419.92 - 425.04] think about that so that's why this
[422.56 - 426.24] misinformation is so
[425.04 - 428.24] basically
[426.24 - 429.36] filled with so many different aspects of
[428.24 - 431.36] it that we're going to cover and go
[429.36 - 432.96] through that are just perplexing in so
[431.36 - 434.64] many ways so let's go into that a little
[432.96 - 437.44] bit guys so we're talking about poop i
[434.64 - 438.56] want to grab a glass here with water
[437.44 - 440.72] okay
[438.56 - 442.40] so the misinformation out there is if
[440.72 - 444.00] your poop floats
[442.40 - 446.96] that means you're sick
[444.00 - 449.36] very unhealthy unwell
[446.96 - 450.96] you're not digesting your food right
[449.36 - 452.24] and all the fat is floating to the
[450.96 - 453.76] surface that's what we're taught right
[452.24 - 455.28] there okay
[453.76 - 457.28] but you got to remember
[455.28 - 459.68] you're being taught that from
[457.28 - 461.04] the industry both medical communities
[459.68 - 462.56] both alternative and conventional that
[461.04 - 464.40] don't know why anybody's sick and don't
[462.56 - 465.68] know why anybody got sick
[464.40 - 467.36] that's how it's always been that's why
[465.68 - 469.12] people go to doctor to doctorate mystery
[467.36 - 472.72] symptoms and they never find any answers
[469.12 - 474.08] so we're taught that by those guys right
[472.72 - 476.16] even functional medicine doctors we're
[474.08 - 477.68] taught that by them that's great but
[476.16 - 479.36] there are people that have been to a lot
[477.68 - 481.92] of functional medicine doctors and still
[479.36 - 483.04] didn't heal until they found mm info
[481.92 - 486.56] and that's why functional medicine
[483.04 - 489.76] doctors now use mm info but the point is
[486.56 - 492.24] is let's go into how it works your stool
[489.76 - 493.68] floating or stool sinking now i said the
[492.24 - 495.36] healthiest stool
[493.68 - 499.36] is a stool that's
[495.36 - 501.76] mid-floating poop that's mid-floating
[499.36 - 503.36] it's okay if your poop sinks if you're
[501.76 - 504.56] eating really healthy and you're doing
[503.36 - 505.76] you're working on your healing process
[504.56 - 507.28] you've got a good diet and your poop
[505.76 - 509.76] sinks that's okay
[507.28 - 511.68] when you eventually get so healthy and
[509.76 - 513.44] your liver heals and everything cleans
[511.68 - 515.36] up your poop will start to float a
[513.44 - 518.64] little bit your poop will start going
[515.36 - 520.96] mid mid float like a mid float there's a
[518.64 - 523.52] reason for that one reason is because
[520.96 - 524.56] you're absorbing every last little bit
[523.52 - 526.80] of fat
[524.56 - 529.44] every last little bit of protein and
[526.80 - 531.44] fats being utilized and absorbed and
[529.44 - 533.68] when all your fat and your protein gets
[531.44 - 536.72] utilized and absorbed you guys your
[533.68 - 539.44] stool starts to mid float it starts to
[536.72 - 541.04] take a little bit of elevation it starts
[539.44 - 542.96] to float a little bit this is so
[541.04 - 544.88] important to know right here
[542.96 - 546.72] so
[544.88 - 547.68] so we have to understand something when
[546.72 - 550.56] you're
[547.68 - 553.52] digestive system is so sharp your
[550.56 - 555.76] liver's literally breaking down every
[553.52 - 557.04] bit of that fat and it's going into your
[555.76 - 559.20] bloodstream
[557.04 - 561.36] right your stomach's breaking down every
[559.20 - 562.48] bit of that protein breaking it down to
[561.36 - 563.36] nothing
[562.48 - 564.80] right
[563.36 - 566.40] but what's going to be left in your
[564.80 - 568.80] stool you guys
[566.40 - 571.44] is fiber
[568.80 - 574.16] fiber floats
[571.44 - 576.72] fiber and pulp
[574.16 - 578.16] will float so you have to know that it's
[576.72 - 579.84] important to know
[578.16 - 582.64] that will float
[579.84 - 584.00] so let's take a banana right
[582.64 - 586.24] a banana
[584.00 - 589.28] is a lot of sugar like we know right
[586.24 - 591.36] that's your sugar it's banana okay so
[589.28 - 594.80] i'll put a piece of banana in here right
[591.36 - 594.80] you'll see the banana float
[594.88 - 599.76] your banana isn't an overt fat it
[597.84 - 601.76] doesn't have a lot of protein in it it
[599.76 - 603.52] doesn't have a lot of fat in it notice
[601.76 - 605.28] it's floating
[603.52 - 607.92] and pouring it out let's take a lemon
[605.28 - 607.92] now all right
[609.12 - 615.28] so let's take a lemon next let's do a
[611.36 - 616.88] lemon slice right here okay a lemon
[615.28 - 619.60] is pulp
[616.88 - 621.68] fiber right
[619.60 - 623.44] and your lemon's floating
[621.68 - 625.04] see how it works
[623.44 - 626.56] so that's your lemon
[625.04 - 628.88] it's floating
[626.56 - 628.88] okay
[629.04 - 634.64] so what happens is
[630.96 - 636.40] that there's no overt fat in here
[634.64 - 638.24] so everybody keeps on saying well it's
[636.40 - 639.52] fat that floats it's fat that floats
[638.24 - 641.60] that's why you're sick it's fat that
[639.52 - 643.44] floats it's that that's not true that's
[641.60 - 645.76] not entirely true we're gonna go we're
[643.44 - 647.60] gonna go through all of this okay
[645.76 - 651.68] nature's gift said or that is made up of
[647.60 - 651.68] mostly water and air not true
[652.24 - 656.48] there's no air in a banana
[654.40 - 659.36] so
[656.48 - 662.00] you're wrong i'm sorry
[659.36 - 664.40] there's no air in a banana
[662.00 - 666.16] very important to know okay
[664.40 - 669.52] there's no air
[666.16 - 671.76] inside the lemon
[669.52 - 675.60] there's no space for air and there's no
[671.76 - 676.64] air inside of a lemon it is liquid pulp
[675.60 - 677.92] fiber
[676.64 - 679.52] pith
[677.92 - 682.32] pectin
[679.52 - 684.24] and all of that floats
[682.32 - 687.12] very important to know right
[684.24 - 689.28] so i know you don't like to be debunked
[687.12 - 691.44] i get it you don't like to be debunked
[689.28 - 693.52] no one likes to be debunked they don't
[691.44 - 695.36] it's another reason why a lot of people
[693.52 - 697.36] in the field of medicine don't like
[695.36 - 698.96] medical medium because they hate being
[697.36 - 700.08] debunked over and over and over again
[698.96 - 701.12] they look like a fool and then they
[700.08 - 702.88] don't know what to do and they're like
[701.12 - 706.00] oh my god we've been wrong let's take a
[702.88 - 709.28] cucumber slice now okay
[706.00 - 711.52] so i got a cucumber slice in here
[709.28 - 713.76] cucumber's floating
[711.52 - 715.68] so i thought that means you're dying if
[713.76 - 717.60] your stool floats so if you're somebody
[715.68 - 719.60] that eats lots of fruits lots of
[717.60 - 721.52] vegetables lots of leafy greens lots of
[719.60 - 723.20] wild foods
[721.52 - 725.20] and your stool floats
[723.20 - 727.44] you're dying
[725.20 - 728.96] does that make any sense
[727.44 - 732.32] see
[728.96 - 733.92] this is important information so i i i
[732.32 - 735.52] would i would recommend re-watching this
[733.92 - 738.08] live i really would because we're going
[735.52 - 740.08] to cover this like
[738.08 - 741.92] all through it right so let's go a
[740.08 - 745.84] little bit more celery
[741.92 - 745.84] there's no air in celery okay
[747.68 - 751.76] it's no air and celery
[749.44 - 754.08] celery's floating
[751.76 - 755.12] right
[754.08 - 756.96] see
[755.12 - 759.36] there's no fat
[756.96 - 762.00] in the celery there's no fat in the
[759.36 - 763.84] cucumber there's no fat in the lemon
[762.00 - 766.72] there's no fat in the banana it's not an
[763.84 - 769.60] overt fat why is it all floating and
[766.72 - 771.28] there's no gas in here
[769.60 - 774.96] you guys
[771.28 - 774.96] there is no gas in here
[775.28 - 779.52] you can't say that a stool that floats
[777.68 - 780.56] because it's made out of pith fiber
[779.52 - 783.36] pectin
[780.56 - 785.92] and pulp
[783.36 - 789.44] you can't say that there's gas in there
[785.92 - 791.44] that's not how it works fiber floats all
[789.44 - 792.72] these things float you see how it works
[791.44 - 795.52] your diet
[792.72 - 798.56] when it's high in all of this you get a
[795.52 - 800.56] mid-floating poop and a floating poop
[798.56 - 802.96] and it's the healthiest poop you can
[800.56 - 804.40] ever get and i'll tell you why
[802.96 - 806.08] see
[804.40 - 808.24] let's go into a little bit more on y and
[806.08 - 809.68] everything so here we are
[808.24 - 810.80] so right now if you guys just came on
[809.68 - 812.24] here i'm going to read some questions
[810.80 - 813.44] about poop we're part of the poop this
[812.24 - 814.64] is part of the poopathon i've been
[813.44 - 816.72] promising
[814.64 - 818.32] i hope i can deliver there's lots of fun
[816.72 - 820.08] stuff to talk about about poop so let's
[818.32 - 823.04] go let's get into it a little bit so i
[820.08 - 825.44] got another glass right here
[823.04 - 825.44] all right
[827.44 - 831.52] we all know chocolate's high in fat
[831.84 - 834.40] if
[832.72 - 837.04] fat is why your poop is floating because
[834.40 - 838.88] you're not digesting any fat and you're
[837.04 - 840.80] thinking oh well a sick poop is
[838.88 - 843.52] undigested fat and that's just what the
[840.80 - 845.52] way it goes let's take a look here
[843.52 - 847.28] i'm gonna put some chocolate in here
[845.52 - 850.64] the chocolate sinks to the bottom like a
[847.28 - 853.28] rock just like your poop
[850.64 - 854.40] just like your it just goes down to
[853.28 - 856.72] the bottom
[854.40 - 858.40] see how it works
[856.72 - 860.40] when you eat a diet
[858.40 - 861.92] with a chocolate bar in it it's going to
[860.40 - 864.24] sink to the bottom
[861.92 - 867.04] when you poo it out because your poop is
[864.24 - 868.48] going to be filled with fat
[867.04 - 870.24] and protein
[868.48 - 872.48] when fat is in your poop it sinks to the
[870.24 - 874.72] bottom of the toilet everybody has a
[872.48 - 876.40] weak liver people dying in the hospital
[874.72 - 877.76] have weak and dysfunctional livers
[876.40 - 880.64] there's people dying in the hospital
[877.76 - 882.16] with liver with liver um
[880.64 - 885.04] failure
[882.16 - 886.80] and they can't digest any of their fat
[885.04 - 889.44] but their poop is stuck to the bottom of
[886.80 - 889.44] the toilet
[890.24 - 894.40] i know so
[891.76 - 896.88] i talked to a lot of patients i talked
[894.40 - 898.64] to a lot of doctors
[896.88 - 901.84] and that happens you can have liver
[898.64 - 904.00] failure and your poops all float to the
[901.84 - 905.20] bottom of the toilet
[904.00 - 907.92] so let's do some more different
[905.20 - 910.40] chocolate here we got some chocolate
[907.92 - 912.56] chips all these chocolate chips are
[910.40 - 913.92] sinking to the bottom of the toilet
[912.56 - 915.44] see
[913.92 - 916.96] that's right
[915.44 - 918.96] like that
[916.96 - 920.32] that's how it goes so i'm dropping all
[918.96 - 922.08] those chocolate chips down into the
[920.32 - 922.88] bottom and there they are
[922.08 - 924.56] right
[922.88 - 926.56] let's do another little test too so
[924.56 - 928.64] let's let's let's keep on testing we'll
[926.56 - 931.76] have some more fun here right let's go
[928.64 - 934.08] with some cashews right
[931.76 - 936.08] dropping some cashews in here too
[934.08 - 938.96] they're all going down
[936.08 - 942.32] to the bottom they're all sinking
[938.96 - 944.96] now cashews have air in them you have to
[942.32 - 946.64] break the cashew open because they
[944.96 - 947.84] actually have an air pocket like a
[946.64 - 950.32] balloon
[947.84 - 952.72] so if you put a whole cashew in it might
[950.32 - 954.80] fall it might float but what happens you
[952.72 - 956.72] need to know is that when you let the
[954.80 - 959.52] air out because you'll see in the middle
[956.72 - 962.24] of a cashew you have a pocket in there
[959.52 - 964.48] it's hollow cashews are actually hollow
[962.24 - 967.20] they're filled with air
[964.48 - 969.12] it's important to know
[967.20 - 971.36] so when you break the cashew in half
[969.12 - 972.40] you'll notice they all sink
[971.36 - 974.56] because
[972.40 - 976.08] that's what fat does
[974.56 - 978.40] it sinks
[976.08 - 980.80] right that's the fat that everybody's
[978.40 - 983.04] eating so let's go into a couple more
[980.80 - 985.12] things let's do this
[983.04 - 987.84] we're going to do some almonds too
[985.12 - 991.28] almonds are sinking see
[987.84 - 993.44] here's how it works everybody
[991.28 - 996.16] if they all had their stools
[993.44 - 997.52] analyzed right and profiles were done on
[996.16 - 998.56] how much fat and proteins in their
[997.52 - 1000.72] stools
[998.56 - 1003.68] it would be loaded with lots of fat
[1000.72 - 1005.68] that's why their poops are sinking it's
[1003.68 - 1008.80] too the fats not being broken down or
[1005.68 - 1011.04] digested this is an unhealthy sign this
[1008.80 - 1012.64] means that people living their lives the
[1011.04 - 1013.68] whole world is pooping and it's sinking
[1012.64 - 1016.64] to the bottom of the toilet the whole
[1013.68 - 1016.64] world's getting sick
[1016.80 - 1020.40] and everybody's poop sinks because
[1018.96 - 1022.16] everybody's poops are filled with
[1020.40 - 1023.36] digestive problems they've digested
[1022.16 - 1026.08] problems and their poops are filled with
[1023.36 - 1027.52] undigested fat and protein see
[1026.08 - 1028.96] so when you eat a whole bunch of almond
[1027.52 - 1030.88] butter you're not breaking all the
[1028.96 - 1032.40] almond butter down so what's happening
[1030.88 - 1034.08] is your almond butter is being pooped
[1032.40 - 1036.40] out and that puts the smear on the
[1034.08 - 1038.40] toilet
[1036.40 - 1040.80] that puts the smear
[1038.40 - 1043.20] on the toilet
[1040.80 - 1044.88] right in there in the basin right that's
[1043.20 - 1047.84] that slimy smear
[1044.88 - 1050.00] that's avocado that's chocolate that's
[1047.84 - 1052.32] yes chocolate that's nut butter that's
[1050.00 - 1054.80] tahini peanut butter that's all of that
[1052.32 - 1056.80] is being smeared there if you're only on
[1054.80 - 1058.32] bananas you're not going to get a smear
[1056.80 - 1060.32] in the toilet
[1058.32 - 1063.76] your poop will probably float if you're
[1060.32 - 1066.56] only on banana after a while
[1063.76 - 1068.48] daisy says not true i'm not sure who
[1066.56 - 1070.88] she's saying not true to
[1068.48 - 1072.88] but that's a daisy saying
[1070.88 - 1074.16] so i have an egg right here
[1072.88 - 1076.56] an egg
[1074.16 - 1079.04] is high in fat this is why doctors for
[1076.56 - 1080.32] many years said be cautious about eggs
[1079.04 - 1081.44] because it'll bring you to a heart
[1080.32 - 1083.04] attack
[1081.44 - 1085.36] and then the egg industry pays for all
[1083.04 - 1086.88] these you know new ads and new studies
[1085.36 - 1088.96] and everything to try to get people to
[1086.88 - 1090.56] start eating eggs again and so the whole
[1088.96 - 1093.28] propaganda and everybody thinks eggs are
[1090.56 - 1095.28] healthy and then you know against
[1093.28 - 1097.20] sane advice that you eat too many eggs
[1095.28 - 1098.56] yeah you'll get a buildup of fat inside
[1097.20 - 1100.16] your heart and arteries
[1098.56 - 1101.60] and cardiovascular system and you'll be
[1100.16 - 1102.88] set up for a stroke heart attack or
[1101.60 - 1104.56] whatever
[1102.88 - 1106.40] yeah
[1104.56 - 1107.28] right
[1106.40 - 1108.48] so
[1107.28 - 1110.96] there's a question right there daisy
[1108.48 - 1113.84] says are you unhealthy and my poop my
[1110.96 - 1115.52] poop is never sinking right
[1113.84 - 1117.36] and i'm going to cover that
[1115.52 - 1118.24] you can have gastritis and have a lot of
[1117.36 - 1121.28] gas
[1118.24 - 1123.52] and your poop can float from lots of gas
[1121.28 - 1126.64] from a from a digestive system that's
[1123.52 - 1128.32] also struggling
[1126.64 - 1130.16] but
[1128.32 - 1132.24] everybody in a hospital in every single
[1130.16 - 1134.56] hospital in the united states and and
[1132.24 - 1135.76] abroad or anywhere else right overseas
[1134.56 - 1137.52] or whatever they're in the hospital
[1135.76 - 1140.32] their poops are sinking they're sick as
[1137.52 - 1141.44] dogs most those people and their poop is
[1140.32 - 1143.52] sinking
[1141.44 - 1145.76] i got an egg right here right i'ma drop
[1143.52 - 1146.72] an egg in here
[1145.76 - 1149.68] okay
[1146.72 - 1152.00] so i just put an egg in this
[1149.68 - 1153.52] that egg sunk to the bottom is what that
[1152.00 - 1155.76] egg did
[1153.52 - 1158.40] so people eat eggs every day
[1155.76 - 1160.72] that egg is high in fat
[1158.40 - 1163.60] and here's with something interesting
[1160.72 - 1165.44] that egg has air in it too
[1163.60 - 1167.28] and look how heavy
[1165.44 - 1169.20] the fat is
[1167.28 - 1171.68] and the protein is in that egg look how
[1169.20 - 1172.48] heavy eggs eggs are really high in fat
[1171.68 - 1176.32] okay
[1172.48 - 1177.84] that's sunk to the bottom see that egg
[1176.32 - 1179.36] when people eat eggs and they're
[1177.84 - 1180.48] undigested and they don't realize it
[1179.36 - 1182.88] their poop sinks to the bottom of the
[1180.48 - 1186.64] toilet i'm trying to tell you guys when
[1182.88 - 1188.64] your digestive system is not sharp
[1186.64 - 1190.84] feezy says okay that's true i have gas
[1188.64 - 1193.60] issues
[1190.84 - 1195.12] yeah of course of course thank you for
[1193.60 - 1196.56] saying that
[1195.12 - 1200.00] some people they just won't say anything
[1196.56 - 1201.44] back they'll just be like you're wrong
[1200.00 - 1202.96] so thank you it's really kind of you
[1201.44 - 1206.32] actually
[1202.96 - 1208.88] and so you have to understand here even
[1206.32 - 1210.48] with air inside that egg that egg sinks
[1208.88 - 1212.16] to the bottom
[1210.48 - 1213.12] so that's important to know
[1212.16 - 1215.12] okay
[1213.12 - 1216.96] so
[1215.12 - 1219.28] what i'm gonna do is
[1216.96 - 1221.60] some of you might doubt that that's not
[1219.28 - 1225.84] a real egg and i i actually understand
[1221.60 - 1226.72] that okay so let me get this out here
[1225.84 - 1228.32] all right
[1226.72 - 1233.40] some of you might doubt that that's real
[1228.32 - 1233.40] egg so and i don't blame you really
[1235.12 - 1238.48] so i just dumped the water on i got the
[1236.72 - 1240.72] egg right here
[1238.48 - 1240.72] okay
[1241.76 - 1246.72] so
[1243.92 - 1248.16] that's a real egg
[1246.72 - 1251.36] hope you can see that egg in there and
[1248.16 - 1251.36] that's the egg yolk right there
[1251.60 - 1254.56] see if you can see that just just
[1253.04 - 1256.00] because i know that you guys know that i
[1254.56 - 1257.12] have
[1256.00 - 1258.88] props and stuff you're thinking well
[1257.12 - 1260.08] maybe that's just a prop but no that's a
[1258.88 - 1260.84] real egg
[1260.08 - 1262.80] right
[1260.84 - 1265.04] there i just wanted to show you guys
[1262.80 - 1265.04] that
[1267.28 - 1269.68] so
[1268.08 - 1271.52] let's let's keep on moving along let's
[1269.68 - 1273.20] go into some nut butters really quick
[1271.52 - 1274.88] okay i'm gonna answer some questions too
[1273.20 - 1277.76] let me show you enough here we have some
[1274.88 - 1279.60] almond butter
[1277.76 - 1281.52] there's oil just rolling around on the
[1279.60 - 1284.24] top it's not butter right why is he
[1281.52 - 1284.24] wearing gloves
[1286.08 - 1290.08] what do you mean
[1288.08 - 1291.36] do i want raw egg all over the board i
[1290.08 - 1292.72] don't just i don't feel like dying i
[1291.36 - 1294.32] don't feel like killing a family member
[1292.72 - 1296.32] tonight
[1294.32 - 1298.00] family member comes in here and starts
[1296.32 - 1300.16] using my cutting board with raw egg all
[1298.00 - 1301.76] over my cutting board and starts to make
[1300.16 - 1303.52] themselves a snack maybe they chop up
[1301.76 - 1305.12] some cucumber slices up or something
[1303.52 - 1306.96] like that and they get that raw egg on
[1305.12 - 1308.80] the cucumber that's the last thing i
[1306.96 - 1311.12] want god forbid they end up in the
[1308.80 - 1314.00] hospital salmonella you guys gotta
[1311.12 - 1316.00] remember you leave your egg salad in the
[1314.00 - 1318.16] sun for five seconds they say you can
[1316.00 - 1320.08] die
[1318.16 - 1322.16] they say you can't leave your potato
[1320.08 - 1325.36] salad or egg salad with mayonnaise which
[1322.16 - 1327.76] is egg you can't leave it outside of
[1325.36 - 1329.60] like room temperature or on a picnic
[1327.76 - 1331.28] table too long they say you're gonna get
[1329.60 - 1334.48] sick and you're gonna end up dead
[1331.28 - 1334.48] there's a reason for that
[1336.32 - 1339.04] i know people
[1339.28 - 1343.60] two people that died at a table in a
[1341.28 - 1345.44] restaurant from salmonella they never
[1343.60 - 1347.92] made it to the hospital in time they
[1345.44 - 1350.16] literally died at the table
[1347.92 - 1351.04] at the table
[1350.16 - 1352.96] and then
[1351.04 - 1354.56] if you don't cook your chicken
[1352.96 - 1356.80] thoroughly
[1354.56 - 1359.36] you can die
[1356.80 - 1363.04] isn't that crazy so yeah okay i got a
[1359.36 - 1363.04] glove on while i'm cracking open an egg
[1363.12 - 1367.52] so that's almond butter right there it's
[1365.12 - 1369.44] sunk right to the bottom
[1367.52 - 1370.88] almond butter when you have a tablespoon
[1369.44 - 1373.04] of almond butter
[1370.88 - 1374.96] your poop will sink to the bottom
[1373.04 - 1376.64] because the almond butter won't be fully
[1374.96 - 1378.24] digested because everybody has a weak
[1376.64 - 1379.76] liver stagnant sluggish liver the liver
[1378.24 - 1381.68] is not working good
[1379.76 - 1385.12] and their hydrochloric acid is not
[1381.68 - 1386.96] strong so unhealthy poops it sinks to
[1385.12 - 1389.20] the bottom so your almond butter ends up
[1386.96 - 1391.84] going to the bottom your eggs end up
[1389.20 - 1394.80] going to the bottom you see how it works
[1391.84 - 1398.24] all of that goes to the bottom
[1394.80 - 1398.24] same thing with peanut butter right here
[1398.56 - 1402.08] smith and pepper says i have tons of
[1400.00 - 1404.80] digestive issues and health issues and
[1402.08 - 1406.08] my poop sinks for sure
[1404.80 - 1408.08] absolutely
[1406.08 - 1409.60] because you can have celiac crohn's
[1408.08 - 1411.04] colitis and your poop sinks to the
[1409.60 - 1413.68] bottom then why is everybody saying it's
[1411.04 - 1413.68] a healthy poop
[1414.32 - 1418.64] see where the misinformation is but it
[1416.24 - 1420.00] takes it takes
[1418.64 - 1423.36] a real
[1420.00 - 1425.68] like awakening to know how the system is
[1423.36 - 1428.24] so corrupted and and backwards with
[1425.68 - 1431.76] everything just everything so let's go
[1428.24 - 1433.68] into some questions right
[1431.76 - 1435.92] here's one right here show me the
[1433.68 - 1437.28] research that states floating poop is
[1435.92 - 1439.44] linked to positive health and not
[1437.28 - 1441.04] dysfunction i will wait
[1439.44 - 1442.88] right
[1441.04 - 1444.08] oh you'll wait
[1442.88 - 1446.00] just like all the other people with
[1444.08 - 1449.44] chronic illness for the last 30 40 years
[1446.00 - 1452.00] that waited for 10 years 20 years
[1449.44 - 1454.16] how to get their thyroid removed
[1452.00 - 1455.68] no research to help them
[1454.16 - 1457.28] all the people with
[1455.68 - 1459.36] severe chronic fatigue syndrome and
[1457.28 - 1460.56] neurological disorders
[1459.36 - 1462.08] they waited
[1460.56 - 1464.24] everybody with lupus and multiple
[1462.08 - 1466.00] sclerosis they waited
[1464.24 - 1468.32] everybody waited and went to 20 30
[1466.00 - 1469.76] doctors so you'll wait too okay good i'm
[1468.32 - 1471.12] glad you weighed
[1469.76 - 1473.44] so let's take a look here i got a
[1471.12 - 1475.12] question right here
[1473.44 - 1476.96] being sarcastic
[1475.12 - 1479.20] anthony i'm not saying that i disagree
[1476.96 - 1481.12] with you because i believe in your
[1479.20 - 1482.80] information
[1481.12 - 1484.24] all i'm saying
[1482.80 - 1486.08] is this
[1484.24 - 1487.68] instead of using peanut butter tahini
[1486.08 - 1489.60] nuts for your experiment why didn't you
[1487.68 - 1491.76] use a spoonful of butter drizzles of any
[1489.60 - 1493.84] oil spoonful of lard
[1491.76 - 1495.52] a spoonful of straight cholesterol you
[1493.84 - 1498.32] will find that those all things those
[1495.52 - 1500.08] float i agree with you that if you have
[1498.32 - 1501.76] a high fiber diet your stools are going
[1500.08 - 1504.16] to float more than sink and i understand
[1501.76 - 1505.84] your reasoning you can still have a high
[1504.16 - 1507.44] fiber diet but if you're eating that
[1505.84 - 1509.28] peanut butter and then almond butter and
[1507.44 - 1510.96] that fat and all that other stuff that
[1509.28 - 1515.24] i'm saying poop's going to sink to the
[1510.96 - 1515.24] bottom even with a high fiber diet
[1515.28 - 1519.12] so i agree with you that if you have a
[1517.36 - 1520.64] high fiber diet your stools are going to
[1519.12 - 1522.16] float more than sink and i understand
[1520.64 - 1524.56] your reasoning and i appreciate your
[1522.16 - 1526.56] teaching but blocked bile ducts and gall
[1524.56 - 1528.88] stones can cause a fatty stool or
[1526.56 - 1530.72] malabsorption of fat not peanut butter
[1528.88 - 1534.64] fat
[1530.72 - 1535.60] so peanut butter fat won't float
[1534.64 - 1537.44] but
[1535.60 - 1540.56] some other fat will
[1537.44 - 1540.56] here's how it works okay
[1540.80 - 1543.76] what happens is people that have
[1542.08 - 1545.28] digestive problems in their and their
[1543.76 - 1547.04] poop floats just because they have a
[1545.28 - 1549.20] black bile duct their poop's not
[1547.04 - 1551.44] floating because the fat's not
[1549.20 - 1553.44] undigested because of a blocked bile
[1551.44 - 1556.08] duct their poops floating because
[1553.44 - 1557.44] they're sick with a ton of gas what
[1556.08 - 1559.52] happens is this would you have
[1557.44 - 1561.76] pancreatitis or pancreatic problems or
[1559.52 - 1564.32] pancreatic duct problems or any kind of
[1561.76 - 1566.56] duct problem even pancreatic cancer the
[1564.32 - 1568.56] reason why your poop floats is because
[1566.56 - 1570.96] your entire intestinal tract is filled
[1568.56 - 1572.72] with a ton of gas because your liver and
[1570.96 - 1575.04] your pancreas are failing to break down
[1572.72 - 1576.32] and digest stuff so what's happening is
[1575.04 - 1579.04] your
[1576.32 - 1581.20] stool is all gas people with pancreatic
[1579.04 - 1583.92] disease pancreatic cancer block bile
[1581.20 - 1585.84] ducts have the worst stream in gastritis
[1583.92 - 1588.48] where it's air that comes out non-stop
[1585.84 - 1590.16] where it's pouring out non-stop now
[1588.48 - 1591.68] someone may not have that experience of
[1590.16 - 1593.20] knowing how that works but i actually
[1591.68 - 1595.20] know how that works and i've seen this
[1593.20 - 1596.96] so over and over again i've known people
[1595.20 - 1598.56] with pancreatic cancer known lots of
[1596.96 - 1600.32] them hundreds of them over the years i
[1598.56 - 1602.64] talk doctors about lots of patients with
[1600.32 - 1604.48] the same thing the gas streams out of
[1602.64 - 1606.32] them and pours out of them and that gas
[1604.48 - 1609.20] fills the stool and that's what makes
[1606.32 - 1609.20] the stool float
[1610.88 - 1614.72] important enough so now i'm going to
[1613.12 - 1616.48] talk about something else within this
[1614.72 - 1618.72] question just so you know so let's go
[1616.48 - 1620.64] into so what this person is saying right
[1618.72 - 1622.72] and i respect this person's question
[1620.64 - 1623.92] question it's great
[1622.72 - 1627.84] they're saying why aren't you trying
[1623.92 - 1627.84] large so let's try other oil
[1628.40 - 1632.96] let's try butter
[1630.96 - 1635.60] so anthony why aren't you using butter
[1632.96 - 1637.04] i'll tell you why i'm not using butter
[1635.60 - 1638.56] right
[1637.04 - 1640.56] i got some butter in here and you'll see
[1638.56 - 1642.00] the butter float so that's a step this
[1640.56 - 1644.24] is a stick of butter
[1642.00 - 1645.68] right
[1644.24 - 1648.08] okay
[1645.68 - 1650.32] and the butter floats
[1648.08 - 1650.32] right
[1650.40 - 1657.84] but people eat that much butter on their
[1652.56 - 1660.72] pancakes every day and their poop sinks
[1657.84 - 1662.72] people eat butter in their food they put
[1660.72 - 1665.84] butter on their chicken their poop
[1662.72 - 1667.68] stinks and it sinks
[1665.84 - 1669.60] people put butter in their food and
[1667.68 - 1671.52] their poops all sink
[1669.60 - 1674.56] all these people eating butter their
[1671.52 - 1676.80] poop sinks every day because no one's
[1674.56 - 1679.12] just eating butter
[1676.80 - 1683.28] no one is just eating a whole stick of
[1679.12 - 1686.88] butter sure if you eat ready for this
[1683.28 - 1688.96] if you eat whole sticks of butter
[1686.88 - 1690.32] like one whole stick of butter two whole
[1688.96 - 1692.08] sticks of butter and three whole sticks
[1690.32 - 1695.28] of butter in a day
[1692.08 - 1698.80] and you poop butter straight out it's
[1695.28 - 1702.16] still not going to float even though it
[1698.80 - 1705.52] floats as butter here it won't float
[1702.16 - 1707.60] after you've gone to bathroom
[1705.52 - 1710.88] if you eat three sticks of butter in a
[1707.60 - 1712.72] day the sticks of butter are gonna
[1710.88 - 1714.96] collect other little bits of debris in
[1712.72 - 1717.28] your intestinal tract anyway it's gonna
[1714.96 - 1720.00] come out as butter because you're over
[1717.28 - 1722.40] you're eating just butter and it's gonna
[1720.00 - 1722.40] sink
[1723.76 - 1728.96] and that's what people don't realize
[1726.08 - 1731.04] if you eat just butter people aren't
[1728.96 - 1732.80] eating just butter anyway no one's
[1731.04 - 1735.28] eating three sticks four sticks of
[1732.80 - 1738.00] butter no one's just downing a whole ton
[1735.28 - 1740.96] of butter that's not what they're doing
[1738.00 - 1742.88] but if you do down a lot of butter like
[1740.96 - 1744.56] three sticks four sticks of butter your
[1742.88 - 1747.20] poop's not gonna float your poop's still
[1744.56 - 1747.20] gonna sink
[1748.08 - 1752.48] the reason why i'm not using butter as a
[1750.64 - 1755.60] poop tested here having it float is
[1752.48 - 1758.72] because no one eats more than that much
[1755.60 - 1760.24] butter and that butter in their poo
[1758.72 - 1763.84] still
[1760.24 - 1763.84] sinks to the bottom of the toilet
[1764.16 - 1767.60] see how it works
[1766.80 - 1770.80] so
[1767.60 - 1773.44] no one's eating just straight fat by
[1770.80 - 1776.32] itself now here's a pure example of this
[1773.44 - 1778.24] if you drink a bottle of olive oil most
[1776.32 - 1780.88] of the olive oil that goes into the
[1778.24 - 1782.08] toilet will sink it'll wrap up with
[1780.88 - 1783.76] little bits of
[1782.08 - 1785.76] debris that's in your intestinal tract
[1783.76 - 1787.28] and all the oil will be in globules and
[1785.76 - 1789.20] it'll sink to the bottom of the toilet
[1787.28 - 1790.88] but a little bit of olive oil will
[1789.20 - 1793.52] surface so you'll still see some
[1790.88 - 1796.56] surfacing to the top but nobody drinks a
[1793.52 - 1798.08] whole bottle of olive oil nobody eats
[1796.56 - 1800.16] sticks and sticks of butter by
[1798.08 - 1801.52] themselves on their own they have a
[1800.16 - 1802.80] little butter on their pancakes their
[1801.52 - 1804.24] waffles they have a little butter on
[1802.80 - 1805.60] their steak but their poops are still
[1804.24 - 1807.44] sinking to the bottom of the toilet and
[1805.60 - 1809.44] there's still butter in their stool
[1807.44 - 1812.16] here's the interesting thing if you get
[1809.44 - 1814.24] a stool test they'll find butter fat in
[1812.16 - 1815.76] the poop that sunk to the bottom along
[1814.24 - 1818.76] with the steak and everything else they
[1815.76 - 1818.76] ate
[1823.92 - 1826.24] so i want to answer a couple more
[1825.12 - 1828.32] questions too
[1826.24 - 1830.32] karen burkett says i've been doing mmm
[1828.32 - 1832.16] for six months now religiously my poops
[1830.32 - 1833.92] still sink yeah and i said this last
[1832.16 - 1835.12] time too
[1833.92 - 1837.44] okay
[1835.12 - 1839.60] inside our guts right
[1837.44 - 1842.56] this is important to know
[1839.60 - 1842.56] inside our guts
[1843.52 - 1846.24] we have
[1846.48 - 1850.96] lots of debris stuck to the inside of
[1848.40 - 1852.56] our guts first of all karen
[1850.96 - 1853.84] when someone says they've been doing mm
[1852.56 - 1856.24] for six months i don't know what that
[1853.84 - 1858.48] means it could be dabbling and no
[1856.24 - 1859.68] offense i i'm honored you're doing it
[1858.48 - 1861.44] i'm happy you're doing it for your
[1859.68 - 1863.12] health but karen
[1861.44 - 1864.80] is it dabbling
[1863.12 - 1866.64] are you doing the mono cleanse for six
[1864.80 - 1868.80] months
[1866.64 - 1870.48] are you doing the 369 advance for six
[1868.80 - 1873.60] months are you doing the heavy metal
[1870.48 - 1875.68] detox movie and the 369 are you doing 32
[1873.60 - 1877.60] ounces of celery juice heavy metal detox
[1875.68 - 1878.96] lui 369
[1877.60 - 1880.56] are you doing the are you doing the
[1878.96 - 1882.96] morning cleanse are you doing the heavy
[1880.56 - 1883.76] metal detox cleanse
[1882.96 - 1885.68] so
[1883.76 - 1887.20] are you doing it in supplementation are
[1885.68 - 1888.64] you doing anything else so when someone
[1887.20 - 1889.84] says i'm doing mm it might be a little
[1888.64 - 1891.68] bit of celery juice and then you're
[1889.84 - 1893.36] doing a couple of recipes or it could be
[1891.68 - 1895.12] a little less or a little more and if
[1893.36 - 1896.88] your poop still sinks
[1895.12 - 1898.64] you might have a lot more healing to do
[1896.88 - 1900.32] you might need to do more you know tools
[1898.64 - 1902.56] i'm not saying everybody needs to do mm
[1900.32 - 1904.88] and then have a poop that actually
[1902.56 - 1907.04] floats midway or to the top i'm saying
[1904.88 - 1910.08] it's going to happen to you if you clean
[1907.04 - 1913.20] up long enough you'll see it mid-float
[1910.08 - 1915.84] and it will be fiber it will be pulp it
[1913.20 - 1918.88] will be pectin and any fat in any
[1915.84 - 1921.68] protein in that stool is gone you will
[1918.88 - 1923.36] have a stool that if it was analyzed by
[1921.68 - 1925.28] a functional medicine doctor they
[1923.36 - 1927.28] wouldn't find fat or protein in it and
[1925.28 - 1929.92] they would be confused
[1927.28 - 1932.96] they'd be like this stool
[1929.92 - 1934.40] is all cucumber and
[1932.96 - 1936.32] lemon and banana
[1934.40 - 1937.68] and potato and all these other things
[1936.32 - 1938.64] where it's all
[1937.68 - 1940.72] fiber
[1938.64 - 1941.76] pulp pectin
[1940.72 - 1943.36] right
[1941.76 - 1945.44] it's all of that
[1943.36 - 1947.04] and any protein and fat in your diet
[1945.44 - 1948.56] gets absorbed quickly so then all of a
[1947.04 - 1951.12] sudden your liver gets stronger and
[1948.56 - 1953.28] stronger and stronger and your your your
[1951.12 - 1955.20] stomach breaks down everything and it
[1953.28 - 1957.04] gets stronger that's what happens when
[1955.20 - 1958.72] people bring back their guts they're
[1957.04 - 1960.56] doing the mono cleanse for a long time
[1958.72 - 1962.80] and they bring back their guts it gets
[1960.56 - 1964.24] so strong there's no protein and fat in
[1962.80 - 1967.20] their stool anymore even if they eat
[1964.24 - 1970.56] avocado that means if that person eats
[1967.20 - 1972.40] an avocado the poop still won't sink if
[1970.56 - 1974.00] the person has a little bit of nuts the
[1972.40 - 1976.56] poop won't the poop won't sink and i'll
[1974.00 - 1979.12] tell you why they got their their guts
[1976.56 - 1981.60] so sharp and so strong in their
[1979.12 - 1983.12] hydrochlor chloric acid hcl was so
[1981.60 - 1985.28] strong breaking down those proteins in
[1983.12 - 1987.44] their liver broke everything down in
[1985.28 - 1988.48] their pancreas
[1987.44 - 1990.56] right
[1988.48 - 1993.52] sent out a lot of digestive enzymes and
[1990.56 - 1994.72] all of that was so keen and so
[1993.52 - 1997.44] strong
[1994.72 - 1999.52] that their poops took mid flight in the
[1997.44 - 2001.92] toilet they took mid-flight they
[1999.52 - 2003.84] actually started surfacing a little bit
[2001.92 - 2006.56] and they were clean and they were filled
[2003.84 - 2008.40] with fiber and pulp and all the fat and
[2006.56 - 2011.52] all that even an avocado if you ate an
[2008.40 - 2013.60] avocado was absorbed and utilized and
[2011.52 - 2016.72] broken down and it wasn't still in the
[2013.60 - 2018.64] intestinal tract so here's what happens
[2016.72 - 2020.24] people walk around with all this in
[2018.64 - 2021.92] their intestinal tract that peanut
[2020.24 - 2023.92] butter can stand there for years that
[2021.92 - 2026.24] chicken can stay in there for years that
[2023.92 - 2028.72] egg can stay in the intestinal tract on
[2026.24 - 2030.64] the walls bits and pieces for years it
[2028.72 - 2032.40] can stay in the liver all of this can
[2030.64 - 2034.16] stay in the liver the peanut butter the
[2032.40 - 2036.32] almond butter can stain the liver for
[2034.16 - 2037.76] years and it builds up and it builds up
[2036.32 - 2039.04] and it builds up and it rots and it
[2037.76 - 2040.88] builds up
[2039.04 - 2042.64] and when it does
[2040.88 - 2044.72] right
[2042.64 - 2046.56] your system breaks down a little bit you
[2044.72 - 2048.32] don't have that strength of the hcl in
[2046.56 - 2050.80] the bio and then what happens is every
[2048.32 - 2053.28] poop just sinks every poop sinks every
[2050.80 - 2056.08] poop sinks and they sink
[2053.28 - 2057.76] but man you do like 369 advanced and
[2056.08 - 2059.44] you're all raw long enough that you
[2057.76 - 2061.84] clean up all that debris and you do the
[2059.44 - 2063.44] mono cleanse and you're all clean long
[2061.84 - 2065.12] enough and you're doing that and you
[2063.44 - 2066.56] take all the overt fats out and you
[2065.12 - 2069.44] build up your liver and you build up
[2066.56 - 2071.28] your hcl man you're gonna be cleaning
[2069.44 - 2073.20] things up so much that when you drop a
[2071.28 - 2075.04] little avocado inside your stomach did
[2073.20 - 2076.32] you hear this check this out did you
[2075.04 - 2078.40] guys hear this
[2076.32 - 2079.52] all the time it happens there's always
[2078.40 - 2080.72] somebody in the medical meeting
[2079.52 - 2083.84] community
[2080.72 - 2086.08] that does the mono cleanse for a year
[2083.84 - 2088.56] or two to heal everything they heal
[2086.08 - 2091.44] everything and then they say i'm sick of
[2088.56 - 2093.60] eating just these these foods i'm sick
[2091.44 - 2095.12] of this i'm going to go and have avocado
[2093.60 - 2096.56] and i'm going to go and have beans and
[2095.12 - 2097.84] i'm going to go and have rice and i'm
[2096.56 - 2099.68] going to go to have all these things i
[2097.84 - 2102.24] want to have chicken and i'm going to go
[2099.68 - 2104.56] and have all that and i feel great and
[2102.24 - 2108.08] my system's working great because all
[2104.56 - 2110.96] that they did by building themselves up
[2108.08 - 2113.36] and strengthening their their liver and
[2110.96 - 2115.04] their stomach
[2113.36 - 2116.88] and when you take it to that point you
[2115.04 - 2119.20] end up going to bathroom you'll just see
[2116.88 - 2121.52] fiber come up because all the protein
[2119.20 - 2123.44] and all the fat will be gone and what's
[2121.52 - 2125.36] happening is everybody on their nut
[2123.44 - 2127.28] butter is fine everybody on their eggs
[2125.36 - 2128.72] whatever they want to be on chicken nut
[2127.28 - 2130.80] butters eggs
[2128.72 - 2133.04] whatever it is that they're doing it
[2130.80 - 2135.76] doesn't get fully broken down it becomes
[2133.04 - 2137.44] a dead weight and it's in the stool
[2135.76 - 2139.52] whether your functional medicine doctor
[2137.44 - 2140.96] knows or anybody else it becomes heavy
[2139.52 - 2142.48] and it sits in the stool and it goes to
[2140.96 - 2144.88] the bottom toilet and that's fine you
[2142.48 - 2146.80] can still be healthy even though things
[2144.88 - 2149.04] are breaking down like your liver is
[2146.80 - 2150.48] weakening your hcl is weakening things
[2149.04 - 2152.24] are going wrong you can still be a
[2150.48 - 2154.08] fairly healthy person
[2152.24 - 2156.72] you can be on a medical medium diet
[2154.08 - 2158.80] healing yourself and your poops don't
[2156.72 - 2160.72] take mid-flight yet because you're not
[2158.80 - 2162.16] there yet but it's okay you're getting
[2160.72 - 2164.48] healthier getting rid of symptoms you're
[2162.16 - 2167.04] getting stronger your poop still sinks
[2164.48 - 2167.04] but still
