1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,480
So today we're talking about how viruses

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:09,179
are alive and how they eat

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,599
so one thing to really understand out

4
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:15,299
there is that no one realizes out there

5
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:17,220
in the medical health world and medical

6
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:19,859
research and science the viruses

7
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:21,779
actually are alive and they actually eat

8
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:23,760
they contradict themselves out there too

9
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:25,619
big part of the medical industry is like

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,840
no viruses are dead they're dead

11
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:29,640
Alternative Health industry viruses are

12
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,500
dead viruses aren't even alive they're

13
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,079
just a strand of itself there's just a

14
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,059
DNA strand of itself and then there's

15
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,520
also but what about the flu what about

16
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:40,620
the flu the flu is probably alive right

17
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,760
and so there's confusion in that Arena

18
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,440
we're going to kind of talk up a little

19
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,320
bit about that but we're going to cover

20
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,120
how viruses are hungry

21
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,840
viruses eat

22
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:54,600
and viruses are alive important to know

23
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:58,199
so anyway got an announcement to make

24
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,460

topic today because this is important

57
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:08,039
because people's immune systems are

58
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:09,660
challenged people don't know how viruses

59
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:11,039
work all of that so we're going to cover

60
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:13,860
some cool information I'm going to read

61
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:15,959
right here out of brain saver as well

62
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,239

page 49 mm school and then school going

68
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:33,420
down right now I'm just gonna say it

69
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,040
page 49 right here brain saver so do you

so we can read together because that's

72
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:43,140
fun I love reading with you guys

73
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:46,980
so okay so I'm reading a part right here

74
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:51,060
page 49 in brain saver living hungry

75
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:52,920
viruses this section is mind blowing it

76
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:54,959
really is this is a powerful piece of

77
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:58,099
information right here so let me start

78
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:01,980
for the record viruses are living

79
00:02:58,099 --> 00:03:03,599
important to know they are alive give

80
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:06,959
you a little bit of an example when

81
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:08,940
someone gets herpes simplex right so if

82
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:12,000
someone has a cold sore

83
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:13,260
and you kiss the person and they have

84
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,440
the cold sore

85
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:19,860
you then can get the cold sore not

86
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:22,560
because the virus is dead if you get the

87
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:26,099
cold sore because the virus is actually

88
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:29,040
living it's alive it's inside the body

89
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:32,940
it's in the sore it's in the saliva in

90
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:35,459
that moment it's there okay so viruses

91
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:39,599
are actually alive this is how cold

92
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:42,959
sores herpes simplex one get trans

93
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:45,000
minute to another person then that's how

94
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:48,239
it's done it's because it is alive drink

95
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,940
out of somebody's glass and they just

96
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:53,640
shrank out of it whatever and then you

97
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:55,260
you could be a year you get it later a

98
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,580
year and it comes out but it could also

99
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:59,040
come out pretty quick and that happens

100
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:01,560
too depending on the variety of the

101
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,239
Simplex in the cold sore virus as well

102
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,819
but anyway let's go into this a little

103
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:08,040
bit for the record viruses are living

104
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:10,500
check this out in the publicly known

105
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:13,080
Arena of science

106
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:15,420
there is a battle about whether viruses

107
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:18,120
are dead or alive

108
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:20,880
no one can agree

109
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:25,139
so in that public medical research and

110
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:29,100
science Arena no one can agree and

111
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:31,800
neither side has proven facts

112
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:33,540
either side they don't have proven facts

113
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,520
they cannot show it they cannot say no

114
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:37,560
I'm going to show you the viruses alive

115
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,000
and the other then the other side I'm

116
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,620
going to show you the virus is dead and

117
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,540
they still can't even show each other

118
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:45,979
which is really incredible all on its

119
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:51,120
own here is a pillar of Truth

120
00:04:45,979 --> 00:04:53,820
viruses are alive viruses are cells not

121
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,320
a strand of something not something

122
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:58,080
that's dead

123
00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:00,180
and viruses eat

124
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,160
and they love food one of the favorite

125
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:05,040
food viruses love is this food I'm

126
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,560
holding in my hand right here that's one

127
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:09,120
of its most favorite foods we'll talk

128
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:13,580
about that too you guys recognize those

129
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,580
right here crack one of these open

130
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:18,960
get it in a pan get it cooking all right

131
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,180
I want to protect my eggs right here I

132
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,500
want to keep them here some baby chicks

133
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:24,900
are going to hatch

134
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:27,900
and I got to get them underneath the

135
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:29,580
heat lamp so they stay warm so they

136
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,380
hatch later on

137
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:33,900
okay

138
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:36,300
for a virus to live long enough inside

139
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:39,000
the human body to create a chronic

140
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:41,639
symptom or condition that's right

141
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,960
do you have a chronic symptom

142
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:45,360
do you have a chronic condition

143
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:48,419
fibromyalgia

144
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,780
R.A Hashimoto's

145
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:52,800
psoriatic arthritis

146
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:54,360
symptoms in general

147
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,259
all kinds of different neurological

148
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,720
symptoms

149
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:59,520
do you have one of those

150
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,500
for a virus to live long enough inside

151
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,479
the human body to create a chronic

152
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:06,240
symptom or condition it has to be able

153
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:08,820
to find food to sustain itself

154
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:12,060
the virus has to be able to find

155
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:14,340
something to eat in order to stay alive

156
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:17,580
inside your body

157
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:19,800
it can't just live inside your body

158
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:23,840
and just live there forever

159
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:26,759
it needs a food source whether an old

160
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:28,259
Well Spring of food inside your body

161
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:30,539
meaning inside your liver or something

162
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:33,780
you got something camped out in here for

163
00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:36,660
many years but it needs something or a

164
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:39,060
new food you just ate that day it needs

165
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:42,500
food in order to sustain itself to stay

166
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:42,500
alive inside our body

167
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:47,759
it has to be able to find a food source

168
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,560
to sustain itself

169
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:52,380
if you guys wonder what I'm reading page

170
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:54,240
49 mm school going down right now got

171
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:56,639
the brain saver book Brain saver

172
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,680
protocols book right there having some

173
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,960
fun today

174
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:04,080
yeah

175
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,940
a virus does not have a mouth now this

176
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,979
little virus here in my hand has a mouth

177
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:13,139
right there and two eyes

178
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:18,020
and some teeth and a nose now viruses do

179
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:18,020
not have a mouth important to know

180
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:25,020
so a virus does not have a mouth and if

181
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:26,940
it's in okay sir as if it's an animal or

182
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:30,419
a human eating

183
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:34,319
instead a virus absorbs fuel

184
00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:37,740
through its viral cell membrane

185
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:41,280
so it has absorption strength

186
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:43,520
that's what a virus does it gets food

187
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,780
through its membrane

188
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:50,280
to eat

189
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:51,900
a viral cell creates a vacuum effect now

190
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,460
medical research inside doesn't know

191
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:55,139
this

192
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:57,960
so this is all advanced information

193
00:07:55,139 --> 00:08:00,360
about viruses and how they eat right

194
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:02,099
here in brain saver so if you're new to

195
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,780
Medical medium information you might be

196
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:04,979
like oh great where did you research

197
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:06,960
that

198
00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:08,580
oh God this guy's pretty cool where did

199
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,199
he research that I want to know where

200
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:11,699
that research paper is he must have done

201
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:13,380
his research

202
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:15,060
it's information that's unknown to

203
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:16,919
medical research and science to all the

204
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:19,139
clinics to all the universities they

205
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:21,660
don't know this

206
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:23,460
they know now a couple years they'll

207
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:25,560
publish a paper

208
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:27,720
plagiarizing this probably and not

209
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:29,819
saving it they've done it already in

210
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,800
different ways

211
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:36,200
so this is important to know right here

212
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:39,899
the viral cell has this vacuum effect

213
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:41,880
temporarily drawing in water

214
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:43,020
this is just unbelievable actually right

215
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:46,320
here

216
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:50,100
within the blood it draws water from

217
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:52,140
your blood into the viral cell

218
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:56,959
that's what it does creates a vacuum

219
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:56,959
effect and draws water into its cell

220
00:08:57,959 --> 00:09:00,899
and then

221
00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:04,860
right

222
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:06,779
in that water is viral fuel

223
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:08,459
and that's the next part so say you got

224
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:10,200
egg particles

225
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:11,760
that have been broken down by your

226
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,800
digestion

227
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,360
that entered the bloodstream up the

228
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,940
hepatocortal vein

229
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,940
got into your main Highway

230
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:23,399
got into your bloodstream

231
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:27,080
and those egg particles

232
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:27,080
are floating around throughout the body

233
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:33,000
well the viral cell creates a vacuum

234
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:35,880
effect temporarily drawing in water

235
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,399
within the blood that's filled with egg

236
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:39,959
particles I'm just using egg as an

237
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,480
example it's not the only thing viruses

238
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:45,000
love to eat

239
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:49,200
and here's the cool part

240
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,060
it draws in this water filled with viral

241
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,459
fuel like egg particles or some other

242
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:56,220
food

243
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:57,420
through any area of the viral cell

244
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,459
membrane

245
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:02,760
so it's not like it has a mouth or it

246
00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:05,160
only vacuums it up through one aspect of

247
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:07,860
the cell membrane the virus actually

248
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:11,160
absorbs the food through any part of the

249
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:14,040
cell membrane so it absorbs that water

250
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:17,580
from your bloodstream with that fuel in

251
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:20,339
it and it enters into the cell at any

252
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:22,880
place around the cell so any part of the

253
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:22,880
viral cell

254
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:28,560
and then immediately excreting that

255
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,779
fluid

256
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,980
through any other part of the cell

257
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:34,080
membrane

258
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:37,320
so here's the other thing so it can

259
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:40,320
actually excrete that fluid

260
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:43,640
if a virus is highly active like simplex

261
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:47,339
one we've got a cold sore Simplex 2

262
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:49,440
right you got a blister somewhere a

263
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:51,720
genital area

264
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,760
you got that you're active it's active

265
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:55,500
or you got mono or you got an

266
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,540
Epstein-Barr that's out and about and

267
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,740
it's doing its thing or you're about to

268
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:00,300
come down with the shingles virus

269
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:02,700
because the shingles is inside of you

270
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:04,680
people spread the shingles virus all the

271
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:08,579
time to other people it's really easy to

272
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:11,399
do or hhv6 or hhv7 or any of the number

273
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:14,579
of Epstein-Barr viruses

274
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:17,700
the virus is highly active it will need

275
00:11:14,579 --> 00:11:20,300
to feed on viral fuel on an hour hourly

276
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,300
basis

277
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:27,420
so viruses don't intermittent fast

278
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:29,760
that's an important thing to know

279
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:32,040
viruses are not on the intermittent

280
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:35,120
fasting diet

281
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:38,660
viruses need to feed every single hour

282
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,660
when they're active

283
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:45,180
so

284
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:48,540
Michelle L hey like ourselves absorb

285
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:50,640
stuff very similar

286
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:53,220
if a virus is highly active it will need

287
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:55,980
a feed every hour if the virus is

288
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:58,860
inactive or even dormant it will need to

289
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:01,260
feed on viral fuel on a weekly to

290
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:03,600
monthly basis

291
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:06,959
Lulu says what do you mean vacuum effect

292
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:09,240
the virus can actually distort its

293
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:12,060
cell-like body and create a vacuum

294
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:13,800
effect drawing water from your

295
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:16,140
bloodstream through the membrane of the

296
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:19,560
virus into the virus itself and then

297
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:20,820
excreting that water back out but

298
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:24,180
leaving

299
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:26,279
bits and pieces of particles behind a

300
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:28,800
food that it likes

301
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:32,519
viruses do like dairy products viruses

302
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,779
like eggs viruses like gluten and you

303
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:35,160
might say oh he's talking about gluten

304
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:37,200
I'm sure there's tons of research on

305
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:39,779
that there isn't

306
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:42,240
they didn't know until the medically in

307
00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:43,500
books that pathogens feed on gluten

308
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,480
itself and that's where the problem

309
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,920
really lies that's why someone can eat

310
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,300
gluten their whole life and not have a

311
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:50,700
problem

312
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:52,200
because the pathogens are either not

313
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:54,120
inside their body or they don't have

314
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:56,519
enough pathogens or the right kind of

315
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:58,079
pathogens they don't have viruses and

316
00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:00,899
the viruses aren't feeding on that

317
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:03,839
gluten somebody else could have two or

318
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:05,459
three Epstein bars a shingles virus hb6

319
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,139
they can have herpes simplex one and

320
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:09,420
when they eat gluten

321
00:13:07,139 --> 00:13:11,279
the viruses go to town and feed on that

322
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:15,000
gluten

323
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:17,880
and that's why a person that's 16 17 18

324
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,680
20 years old 25 years old can have a

325
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:22,980
problem with gluten and then that 80

326
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:25,380
year old guy down the road doesn't have

327
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:27,779
a problem with food

328
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:29,639
and the Doom says I saw one of the

329
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:30,779
podcast doctors talking about thick

330
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:33,540
blood today

331
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:34,500
hmm wonder where that one key got that

332
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:37,500
one

333
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:41,899
yeah that's actually real pleasure

334
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:41,899
plagiarism at its best right there

335
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:52,560
ah What a Wonderful World it is

336
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:55,860
okay let's move on a little bit good

337
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:58,880
stuff in here Tammy says virus draws in

338
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:58,880
water dot dot dot

339
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:05,279
is that one of the reasons people with

340
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:06,600
virus can feel dehydrated it's it's not

341
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,639
one of the reasons why usually people

342
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,720
are just chronically dehydrated Tammy

343
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,700
and thanks for the question it's really

344
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:14,600
cool it's a great question you're over

345
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,600
there on Facebook awesome

346
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:19,079
if the virus is inactive like I said it

347
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:20,639
could take a week to do a feeding it

348
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:24,600
could take a month to do a feeding if

349
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:27,360
the virus is really dormant and inactive

350
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:30,060
the virus has an ability to expel almost

351
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:32,820
all fluid out of its cell structure so

352
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:35,579
it can then be refilled and new fluid

353
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:37,560
that Harbors the viral fuel how insane

354
00:14:35,579 --> 00:14:39,899
is that

355
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:42,120
let's see

356
00:14:39,899 --> 00:14:45,000
which page are you reading over there on

357
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:46,980
YouTube I'm reading page 49 doing a

358
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,940
little mm spool for the moment just fun

359
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:50,339
stuff

360
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:52,620
we got brain saver you there's two books

361
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:54,860
right you know about that brand saber

362
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:58,380
protocols get them at amazon.com us

363
00:14:54,860 --> 00:15:01,320
they're over 40 off right now I was like

364
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:03,000
oh my God amazon.com us

365
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:04,860
and they're just they're they're heavy

366
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,500
books just forewarning I saw somebody

367
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:09,720
did complain and I felt bad because they

368
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:11,639
were like oh my God like when they got

369
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:13,199
it delivered to them they're like I

370
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:15,300
didn't know these books were that big

371
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:17,880
that failed I mean

372
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:20,420
the information is so vast and insane in

373
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,420
these books

374
00:15:20,579 --> 00:15:26,279
Maria says can Gloria chlorine dioxide

375
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:27,720
work to kill the viruses if you look in

376
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:30,060
the brain saver you'll see I talk about

377
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,680
chlorine dioxide

378
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:35,480
and I talk about how it doesn't work

379
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,480
check it out it's in here

380
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:40,139
all right

381
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:42,300
but it took about like the information

382
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:45,180
and protocols in the books

383
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:47,880
if you're concerned about that

384
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:50,519
so the virus has an ability to expel

385
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,660
almost all fluid out of its cell

386
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:54,360
structure

387
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:57,779
so it can then be refilled with new

388
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:59,160
fluid that Harbors viral fuel so you

389
00:15:57,779 --> 00:16:01,079
ready for this

390
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:06,300
the buyers

391
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:11,699
can squeeze out all fluid out of itself

392
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:14,279
and then vacuum up a whole new batch

393
00:16:11,699 --> 00:16:18,260
of water from your bloodstream filled

394
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:18,260
with more viral fuel

395
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:26,220
when the virus is active and feeding

396
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:29,040
regularly its viral cells are

397
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:31,199
continually excreting all of their

398
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:34,699
contents through their cell membranes so

399
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:38,220
here's where we get in trouble

400
00:16:34,699 --> 00:16:40,320
here's where we get in trouble it's one

401
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:42,000
of the places

402
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,279
and before I move on that I want to say

403
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,380
one other thing too

404
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:48,660
eggs are not the only thing they eat so

405
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:50,699
I want to make that clear eggs are not

406
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:51,959
the only thing viruses eat virus swims

407
00:16:50,699 --> 00:16:55,160
in your body

408
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:55,160
it just loves those eggs

409
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:00,000
all right

410
00:16:57,959 --> 00:17:01,500
viruses love toxic heavy metals they

411
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,120
love dairy products they love gluten

412
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:05,100
they love lots of things I've talked

413
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,600
about this in all of the eight medical

414
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:09,980
medium books

415
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,980
on the medical mean book series

416
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,780
when the virus is active in feeding on a

417
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,600
regular basis check this out you guys

418
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:22,100
this is this is all like

419
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:22,100
what huh

420
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,819
I mean it's incredible really I mean

421
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:30,360
when I was getting the information on

422
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:33,600
this alone I was just like oh my God

423
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:36,600
this is like mind-blowing

424
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:38,820
so when a virus is feeding a lot because

425
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:41,220
it's really highly active

426
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:43,140
its viral cells are continually

427
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:44,520
excreting right all of their contents

428
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:47,039
through the cell membranes making

429
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:49,320
someone who has the viral infection

430
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:51,360
experience heightened symptoms

431
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:52,500
so here's how it works

432
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,360
I'm just going to give you a quick

433
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,980
rundown on some symptoms right now I

434
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:57,299
mean there's 300 symptoms and conditions

435
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,860
in these books

436
00:17:57,299 --> 00:18:00,660
I mean check them out when you can you

437
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:02,820
can go to amazon.com and get them over

438
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:04,620
40 off but check this out or for library

439
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:07,440
for free go to the library for free

440
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:09,179
so when somebody has a viral infection

441
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,679
they don't know they have that their

442
00:18:09,179 --> 00:18:12,299
doctor can't tell them their doctor's

443
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:14,100
not telling them they're going from

444
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:15,419
Doctor to doctor to doctor they're

445
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,919
looking for answers they're going to

446
00:18:15,419 --> 00:18:19,919
neurologists and Specialists and

447
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:22,140

463
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:59,039
mystery their feet pain that's a mystery

their nose their face

00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:12,780
all these different symptoms they don't

470
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:15,059
realize are viral they don't know that

471
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:17,039
and the doctor doesn't know that if you

472
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:18,960
hear that on on a podcast somewhere of a

473
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:21,120
doctor talk about it it's published

474
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,299
medical meme info and nobody knew any of

475
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,299
this

476
00:19:24,419 --> 00:19:29,660
Tiffany Scott says Anthony I have sent

477
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:32,520
you messages about my story healing

478
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:37,700
whoa your bronchitis and I never heard

479
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:37,700
back I'm Healed oh my God incredible

480
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:42,419
incredible

481
00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:45,660
I might not have seen them I mean

482
00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:48,539
I'm not trying to like say anything

483
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:51,900
but a lot of stuff is hidden

484
00:19:48,539 --> 00:19:54,000
like there's a lot of glitches on IG and

485
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:56,220
other platforms and it's a lot of stuff

486
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,840
that I never see

487
00:19:56,220 --> 00:20:02,460
and there's a lot of stuff you guys

488
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:05,280
never see too which is just it's sad

489
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:07,080
okay you ready you guys

490
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:09,600
the reason why I was saying the problem

491
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:12,059
is if the virus is really active and

492
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:15,179
it's feeding a lot and it's eating a lot

493
00:20:12,059 --> 00:20:18,780
and it's on a regular basis that means

494
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:21,419
when the virus takes in the fuel

495
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:24,780
into the virus

496
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:28,679
eats it and then excretes it's excreting

497
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:31,620
a neurotoxin so now the virus is

498
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:33,299
excreting byproduct out of it which

499
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:35,340
could be neurotoxins of all kinds of

500
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:36,900
varieties depending on what the virus is

501
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:39,780
feeding on

502
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:42,179
if the virus is feeding on copper so

503
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:43,980
don't drink out of the copper fasks and

504
00:20:42,179 --> 00:20:46,080
don't you know don't do the whole copper

505
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:48,299
thing you got to be careful if the virus

506
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:50,520
is feeding off of copper then you're

507
00:20:48,299 --> 00:20:53,400
going to be getting like all kinds of

508
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:57,660
stuff eczema psoriasis

509
00:20:53,400 --> 00:21:00,539
so the virus actually fills up with all

510
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:02,760
kinds of food eats it and then excretes

511
00:21:00,539 --> 00:21:06,780
it on a regular basis

512
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:09,679
and here's the deal that toxic stuff

513
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:13,020
that the virus is excreting you guys

514
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:15,539
circulates in the bloodstream and lands

515
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:18,480
on nerves and now you've got vagus

516
00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:20,760
nerves that are inflamed because you're

517
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:23,760
really highly active with the low-grade

518
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:27,059
or higher grade viral infection so now

519
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:28,620
you got nerve problems

520
00:21:27,059 --> 00:21:30,000
you got the vertigo you got the

521
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,500
dizziness you got the ringing in the

522
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,880
ears the tinnitus you've got all the

523
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,620
different aches and pains the burning

524
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,960
skin you got the Restless Leg Syndrome I

525
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:38,520
could go on and on and on

526
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,980
and then you're going to get all kinds

527
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:42,720
of diagnoses oh wait the doctor thinks I

528
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:44,700
have Lupus the doctor thinks I have MS

529
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,260
and doctor thinks I just have five row

530
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:48,120
the doctor thinks I'm crazy you're just

531
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:50,400
gonna it's gonna be all these different

532
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:52,919
things

533
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:59,120
that's what happens when the bug is

534
00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:59,120
gobbling up and excreting and excreting

535
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:10,100
the publicly known medical industry

536
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:10,100
is completely unaware that viruses eat

537
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:16,020
that's a medical medium

538
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:17,880
and medical medium science piece of

539
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:19,799
information

540
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:22,380
a publicly known medical industry is

541
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:23,880
completely unaware you guys that viruses

542
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:26,820
eat

543
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:29,340
they have not seen it studied it written

544
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:31,260
a paper on it

545
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:33,659
it is medical medium information a

546
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:37,559
viruses eat the classified get ready for

547
00:22:33,659 --> 00:22:40,559
this the classified medical industry

548
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:40,559
knows

549
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:47,760
classified medical industry

550
00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:52,400
knows because the classified medical

551
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:52,400
industry feeds viruses and breeds them

552
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:58,799
Harvard wherever medical universities

553
00:22:56,039 --> 00:23:01,919
clinics

554
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:05,340
everywhere around the world

555
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:07,980
don't know viruses eat they have no clue

556
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:10,860
and no idea all the doctors they Stamp

557
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:12,900
Out have no idea viruses eat

558
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:14,700
but classified medical research in

559
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:18,480
science which is completely a different

560
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:21,120
world and separated it's separated

561
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,919
completely from all public university

562
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,900
medical research and science to

563
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:26,940
Everything Medical Schools it's

564
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:28,980
completely separated

565
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:30,539
and the classified medical industry

566
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:33,900
knows

567
00:23:30,539 --> 00:23:35,880
that viruses actually eat because the

568
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:39,240
classified medical industry

569
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:42,900
feeds the viruses and then breeds them

570
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:45,900
keeps them alive in their labs and uses

571
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:48,140
viruses food of choice preferably raw

572
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,140
egg

573
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:53,539
iron

574
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:53,539
and Mercury

575
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,720
that piece of information you're

576
00:23:55,559 --> 00:24:00,360

577
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:02,460

because it's going to be really fun and

600
00:24:45,659 --> 00:24:51,600
we're gonna make a lot of drinks

601
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:54,380
we're gonna make a lot of drinks

602
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,380
I'm excited

603
00:24:54,419 --> 00:24:58,559
but I'm really stuck on this piece of

604
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:01,559
information right here like I'm stuck on

605
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:03,299
this like this is insane

606
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:05,780
check this out

607
00:25:03,299 --> 00:25:05,780
okay

608
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:09,720
the classified medical industry knows

609
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,460
because classified medical industry

610
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:14,159
feeds a virus but check this out they

611
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:16,679
feed them a preferable food that the

612
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:19,020
viruses love

613
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:20,880
which is eggs

614
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:22,559
iron

615
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,720
iron

616
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:26,580
know why people are they have all that

617
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,900
different iron deficiencies it's all

618
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:29,640
mystery to medical research and science

619
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:31,620
why they have iron deficiencies

620
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:33,380
whether anemia and all that is happening

621
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:36,840
and it's happening rampantly right now

622
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:39,299
viruses feed on iron inside the person's

623
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:41,159
blood making them anemic so it's

624
00:25:39,299 --> 00:25:43,620
mysterious

625
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:45,179
to the doctors in public medical

626
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:47,100
research and science

627
00:25:45,179 --> 00:25:49,500
and of course Mercury that's another one

628
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:51,600
too other Foods the classified medical

629
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:53,940
industry feeds viruses to keep them

630
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:55,980
alive are gluten

631
00:25:53,940 --> 00:26:00,000
which nobody knows that

632
00:25:55,980 --> 00:26:01,919
Dairy nobody knows that and GMO medical

633
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,799
grade corn

634
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:08,580
so the classified medical industry

635
00:26:03,799 --> 00:26:11,159
sometimes uses GMO medical grade corn to

636
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:13,940
feed the bugs they breed raise

637
00:26:11,159 --> 00:26:13,940
in labs

638
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:18,419
here's another interesting part right

639
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:21,860
here I mean do you guys have the books

640
00:26:18,419 --> 00:26:21,860
I'm on page 49.

641
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:27,179
one of the problems of the publicly

642
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:31,559
known medical industry when it comes to

643
00:26:27,179 --> 00:26:33,720
viruses is that it's so underfunded in

644
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:35,460
this area so you got to keep in mind too

645
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:37,020
the reason why public medical research

646
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:41,279
science doesn't know anything about

647
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:44,120
viruses is because it's underfunded

648
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:44,120
that's why

649
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:48,720
no one can find the truth even if they

650
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:52,559
want to

651
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:55,080
unless they grab a medical medium book

652
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:56,820
so they hash out theories that are all

653
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:58,860
on paper because they're not allowed to

654
00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:01,140
study viruses adequately so just so you

655
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:04,919
know publicly known medical research and

656
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:07,620
science are not allowed to study viruses

657
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:09,600
they're allowed to talk viruses and talk

658
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:12,059
virus theories they're not allowed to

659
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:14,279
study them

660
00:27:12,059 --> 00:27:16,100
Never mind take a virus of choice and

661
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:18,600
look at it under a microscope so

662
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:21,260
publicly known medical research in

663
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:24,120
science are not allowed to take viruses

664
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:26,520
study them under a microscope

665
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:28,500
and figure out how they work

666
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:31,940
it's not allowed in the public medical

667
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:33,900
research and science Arena

668
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:36,000
virologists are not allowed to do that

669
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:38,940
they're allowed to be a virologist but

670
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:42,679
they're not allowed to do that

671
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:46,820
very few doctors are scientists that get

672
00:27:42,679 --> 00:27:49,679
authorization check this out

673
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:52,620
very few doctors here in the public

674
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:55,440
medical research and science Arena

675
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:58,159
get authorization

676
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,159
from

677
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:03,600
The Wizard of Oz

678
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:06,779
and the outcomes are always vague

679
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:09,179
obscure and inconclusive so if

680
00:28:06,779 --> 00:28:12,960
a medical doctor does want to study

681
00:28:09,179 --> 00:28:14,159
viruses very few in the world in the

682
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:17,100
public medical research and science

683
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:19,020
Arena are allowed to look at a virus and

684
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:20,760
their conclusions are always vague and

685
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:22,980
obscure

686
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:25,080
inconclusive

687
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:27,179
so the publicly known medical industry

688
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:29,220
stays stuck in its war with itself over

689
00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:33,179
whether viruses are just a dead strand

690
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:35,960
of RNA and protein

691
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:40,869
or they're alive

692
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:40,869
[Music]

693
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:48,120
many medical professionals believe

694
00:28:45,179 --> 00:28:50,940
viruses are only alive if they're an

695
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:53,900
influenza

696
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:53,900
flu strain

697
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:00,740
so keep that in mind that's the only

698
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:03,419
time it's allowed

699
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:05,220
and Epstein-Barr is not alive to the

700
00:29:03,419 --> 00:29:07,799
medical research at Science World uh

701
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:09,240
yeah shingles is not alive uh nothing's

702
00:29:07,799 --> 00:29:11,880
alive

703
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:13,679
not even simplex one is alive nothing's

704
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:14,960
alive in the world of medical research

705
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:18,419
and science

706
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:22,140
but many many medical professionals

707
00:29:18,419 --> 00:29:24,059
believe viruses are alive only

708
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:28,399
the ones that do believe they're alive

709
00:29:24,059 --> 00:29:28,399
only believe influences alive

710
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:33,299
and even then it remains questionable

711
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:35,100
because of this ongoing internal War

712
00:29:33,299 --> 00:29:37,860
you're not allowed to look at the

713
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:39,179
influenza influenza under the microscope

714
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:42,360
as a doctor

715
00:29:39,179 --> 00:29:44,820
granted or funded to do so so you really

716
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:47,299
don't know if the flu is actually alive

717
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:47,299
or not

718
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:52,080
you guys following me on this stuff the

719
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:54,000
publicly known medical industry has to

720
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,860
work with theories kind of like

721
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,919
astronomers do

722
00:29:55,860 --> 00:30:00,899
as an astronomer you go to bed at night

723
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:03,059
dreaming about what you might discover

724
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:05,700
behind the stars with your telescope

725
00:30:03,059 --> 00:30:08,880
right so if you're into the stars and

726
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:10,679
you go to school to be an astronomer

727
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:13,679
you basically just go to bed at night

728
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:16,679
wondering what's behind those Stars

729
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:18,360
the same thing as a virologist in the

730
00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:19,980
publicly known medical industry you go

731
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:22,620
to bed at night dreaming that someday

732
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:26,580
you may get funded

733
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:28,559
and truly discover what a virus does

734
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:31,340
so if you want to grow up someday and

735
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:31,340
become a virologist

736
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:35,279
you're going to be going to bed every

737
00:30:33,299 --> 00:30:37,919
night wondering what a virus really does

738
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:40,740
and in hopes that maybe you get funded

739
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:44,179
to get a chance to look at a virus

740
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:46,500
if you're lucky and if you do

741
00:30:44,179 --> 00:30:48,059
inconclusive that's what your study

742
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:51,080
paper will say

743
00:30:48,059 --> 00:30:51,080
I wonder why

744
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,659
and then you're gonna and then you're in

745
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:57,960
bed at night wondering as a virologist

746
00:30:54,659 --> 00:31:01,820
is a virus even alive or not maybe it's

747
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:01,820
an RNA DNA strand

748
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:06,000
in the meantime you keep yourself busy

749
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:08,820
in your career attending meetings and

750
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:11,100
medical com you know conventions and

751
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:12,539
reading other colleagues theoretical

752
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:14,700
papers

753
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:17,760
and you listen to that Lucky Devil who

754
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:19,500
was funded briefly who's up on the stage

755
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:21,120
at a convention talking about their

756
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:23,700
theory of what they think they

757
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:26,880
discovered that's the Grim reality of

758
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:28,500
the publicly known medical industry

759
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,820
you guys were reading right here at

760
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:31,380
brain saver

761
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:33,480
we got the brain saver books right here

762
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:35,220
we're doing a little virus talk if you

763
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:37,260
guys don't mind it's pretty cool I mean

764
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:40,320
I love this information when I receive

765
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:42,360
the information I was so like oh my God

766
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:44,120
this is unbelievable the information's

767
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:46,320
incredible

768
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:47,820
that's my opinion you might have a

769
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,779
different opinion you're like well I

770
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:51,899
don't know

771
00:31:48,779 --> 00:31:53,520
the classified medical industry is a

772
00:31:51,899 --> 00:31:56,179
whole other game

773
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:56,179
uh oh

774
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:02,340
they know that viruses eat

775
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:05,279
they do

776
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:07,679
SOC has told me they do

777
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:11,580
they feed the viruses

778
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:13,820
uh-huh they do

779
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:17,100
they grow viruses

780
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:19,980
proliferate viruses and altar viruses

781
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:22,159
and every now and then one escapes the

782
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:22,159
lab

783
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:26,279
this is what the classified medical

784
00:32:24,299 --> 00:32:29,159
industry has been doing for over a

785
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:33,240
hundred years now since the Spanish Flu

786
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:33,240
was released in 1918.

787
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:39,000
this is what classified medical research

788
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:41,659
and science has been doing for over a

789
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,659
hundred years now

790
00:32:43,399 --> 00:32:48,179
the classified medical industry knows

791
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:50,220
more about viruses much more than the

792
00:32:48,179 --> 00:32:52,080
publicly known medical industry which is

793
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:54,539
your doctor at the doctor's office your

794
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:56,760
scientists at the science lab

795
00:32:54,539 --> 00:33:01,020
your University Medical you know

796
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:03,659
researcher whatever they don't know

797
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:06,539
remember this

798
00:33:03,659 --> 00:33:08,760
I repeat remember this

799
00:33:06,539 --> 00:33:11,220
viruses are alive

800
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:15,980
viruses eat

801
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:15,980
and viruses are a single cell

802
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:24,299
that is viruses are single cell living

803
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:24,299
microorganisms

804
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:30,899
while it's always possible through a

805
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:33,120
mutation change a mutated change

806
00:33:30,899 --> 00:33:35,760
for them to become multi-cell living

807
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:39,179
microorganisms

808
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:42,120
we'll talk here about single cells

809
00:33:39,179 --> 00:33:45,299
because as time check goes by and

810
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:47,340
they're messed with anything's possible

811
00:33:45,299 --> 00:33:50,940
the most appropriate term for these

812
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:53,760
single cell microorganisms is viral cell

813
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:56,779
that's the most appropriate term for

814
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,779
what's ailing people

815
00:33:57,059 --> 00:34:01,080
as we get into the details of how

816
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:03,299
viruses inflame the central nervous

817
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:05,100
system and cause life-altering symptoms

818
00:34:03,299 --> 00:34:07,799
and conditions in the process because

819
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:10,919
you guys that's what's happening right

820
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:13,320
now you've got a whole world of sick

821
00:34:10,919 --> 00:34:15,540
people developing they're developing

822
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:18,240
with neurological symptoms

823
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:19,980
the brain saver books are here for that

824
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:22,280
right

825
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:25,020
but this is what everybody's

826
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:28,399
experiencing and living with

827
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:28,399
that's how it's going now

828
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:34,200
the reality that viruses are hungry

829
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:36,359
living microorganisms will be

830
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:39,000
foundational knowledge

831
00:34:36,359 --> 00:34:41,359
in the future if they're going to save

832
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,359
people

833
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:46,440
from pain and suffering

834
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:47,639
so I got a little bit more to read if

835
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:49,500
you guys are up for it I just want to

836
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:52,139
give you a little 4-1-1 making an

837
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:55,320
announcement and I made an announcement

838
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:57,420
I'm excited for the two day free Wild

839
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:58,920
blueberry challenge but it's a drink

840
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:00,060
challenge which is really cool and

841
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,560
that's going to be fun I'm going to make

842
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:03,900
all these different drinks and since the

843
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:05,760
holidays are happening it might be

844
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:08,339
really fun and you get to stay away from

845
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:09,660
alcohol yeah you might not want to stay

846
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:11,700
away from alcohol because you might like

847
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:14,339
alcohol you might be somebody who likes

848
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:17,040
alcohol and I get it but like it'd be

849
00:35:14,339 --> 00:35:18,960
nice to give your body a break and maybe

850
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:22,140
do a whole bunch of drinks that don't

851
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:25,800
have alcohol in them and instead are

852
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:27,599
really high in antioxidants really high

853
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,920
in antioxidants that would be really

854
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:32,220
cool

855
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:33,660
go to medicalme.com and you will see or

856
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:35,220
Link in the description Link in the

857
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:37,800
profile

858
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:40,440
definitely download your free grocery

859
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:42,780
shopping list get on the medical medium

860
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:45,420
newsletter

861
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:47,460
brain cells are highly vulnerable

862
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:49,680
so that's the thing with brain cells

863
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:51,240
they're different than other cells

864
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:53,099
inside our body other cells are inside

865
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:57,079
our body

866
00:35:53,099 --> 00:35:57,079
are not as vulnerable

867
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:04,859
brain cells have to be pure and clean

868
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:07,859
unlike the liver which is meant to be a

869
00:36:04,859 --> 00:36:10,380
filter for the body so your liver cells

870
00:36:07,859 --> 00:36:13,400
are meant to be a filter for your body I

871
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:13,400
hope this doesn't fall out

872
00:36:13,619 --> 00:36:18,599
these cells are tougher

873
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:19,800
these cells are meant to handle some

874
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:22,140
dirt

875
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:25,800
that's what your cells in your liver are

876
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:27,000
meant to do they're meant to handle some

877
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,920
dirt

878
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,060
and some grime

879
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:32,400
okay

880
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:34,560
but your brain cells

881
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:37,440
much more fragile

882
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:38,400
they're designed to just be pure and

883
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,200
clean

884
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:42,480
and that's the difference so when it

885
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:45,960
comes down to brain cells they have to

886
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:51,000
be pure and clean

887
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:53,280
it can't be dirty cells your liver

888
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,140
has dirty cells

889
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,880
now you don't want your liver saturated

890
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:58,380
with so much gunking problems and

891
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,540
everything you want to know the medical

892
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:02,160
meme information to clean up your liver

893
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:03,720
because you clean up your liver you

894
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,099
clean up your brain because that means

895
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:07,020
less stuff gets in the brain so let's

896
00:37:05,099 --> 00:37:09,119
get into that

897
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:11,160
unlike the liver which is meant to be a

898
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:13,200
filter for the body the brain is never

899
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:16,160
meant to be a physical filter but guess

900
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:19,260
what you guys ADHD

901
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:22,619
depersonalization brain fog

902
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:25,940
focus and concentration issues

903
00:37:22,619 --> 00:37:25,940
depression anxiety

904
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:32,460
100 other different symptoms

905
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:34,140
our brain becomes the filter

906
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:37,079
so our brain

907
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:39,420
is bringing in it doesn't want to bring

908
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:41,940
in but it ends up bringing in

909
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:43,680
our body brings brings in lots of toxins

910
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:45,240
and poisons that get to the brain cells

911
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:47,460
and the brain cells aren't pure and

912
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:49,079
clean anymore they get heavy metals in

913
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:51,180
them and so many other different toxins

914
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:52,380
and poisons that we talk about all the

915
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:55,040
time and we talk about in the brain

916
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:55,040
saver books

917
00:37:55,859 --> 00:37:58,940
just mind-blowing information

918
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:04,280
your brain should never be a filter in

919
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:07,859
this scent in this sense

920
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:10,260
toxins your brain should only be a

921
00:38:07,859 --> 00:38:12,500
filter in the sense of processing

922
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:12,500
information

923
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:17,339
that's when your brain is a filter when

924
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:19,980
it's processing information

925
00:38:17,339 --> 00:38:21,480
but your brain is not supposed to be a

926
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:23,960
physical filter

927
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:25,740
for air fresheners scented handles

928
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:27,359
detergents that have all kinds of

929
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:29,280
chemicals in them

930
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:31,140
right Chemtrails falling out of the sky

931
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,640
toxic heavy metals that are in all kinds

932
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:35,940
of pharmaceuticals you name it it's not

933
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:38,460
supposed to be a filter for that but

934
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:41,960
your brain ends up becoming a filter for

935
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:41,960
all that stuff and all that chunk

936
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:48,480
it should only ever be a filter the

937
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:51,240

939
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:57,720
Karen asks what book is this one page 50

940
00:38:55,619 --> 00:39:01,200
of brain saver

941
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:05,040
check it out it's for over 40 amazon.com

942
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:07,500
us buy both books here what book is aw

943
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:08,820
referencing Pamela Miller I'm in brain

944
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:12,079
saver

945
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:12,079
you guys have the book right

946
00:39:14,339 --> 00:39:18,200
our brain should only be a filter for

947
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:20,400
processing information you guys

948
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:22,079
receiving Communications from another

949
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:25,280
source or another human being that's

950
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:25,280
when our brain becomes a filter

951
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:29,760
the brain houses a complex spiritual

952
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:32,040
Network

953
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:34,260
it also houses a complex physical

954
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:36,660
Network

955
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:39,839
which requires absolute

956
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:42,480
Purity to the highest degree

957
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:44,760
it can't be that expired piece of fish

958
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:47,160
at the market with the fog glazing over

959
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:49,980
its eyes and an odor coming off of it

960
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:52,079
because the fish had become a filter for

961
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:53,940
a polluted ocean loaded with dioxins

962
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:57,839
Mercury nuclear waste petrochemicals and

963
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:57,839
sewage filled and pharmaceuticals

964
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:04,280
see

965
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:09,060
Maria says

966
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:10,920
LMAO so laughing my ass off

967
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:13,920
obviously

968
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:16,579
she says but the fact that he thinks

969
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:20,700
that the Spanish Flu really existed

970
00:40:16,579 --> 00:40:23,220
laughing my ass off makes me think

971
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:25,920
you know like why I want to laugh my ass

972
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:27,839
off right now whatever wherever you got

973
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,760
the information that the Spanish Flu

974
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:32,460
didn't exist

975
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:34,920
makes me laugh my ass off

976
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:36,200
because then that means that wherever

977
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:39,359
you got that information

978
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:40,920
they're not really an intelligent source

979
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:42,480
and I guess I shouldn't be laughing my

980
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:45,660
ass off I should be

981
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:49,260
more like being sad

982
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:51,000
and saying that's sad that's sad kind of

983
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:52,380
breaks my heart a little bit

984
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,359
because that means there's a lot of

985
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:55,859
people out there it's a lot of stupid

986
00:40:54,359 --> 00:40:58,920
information

987
00:40:55,859 --> 00:40:59,700
and you're sitting there laughing at

988
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:02,099
like

989
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:04,380
incredible Advance information that's

990
00:41:02,099 --> 00:41:06,300
already saved lives the medical medium

991
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:08,220
book series right and you're sitting

992
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:09,240
there laughing and that's cool and all

993
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:10,619
because I think that's kind of funny

994
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:12,180
that you're laughing because anytime

995
00:41:10,619 --> 00:41:14,099
someone laughs I kind of laugh anyway

996
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:17,280
I'm like oh you're laughing at that okay

997
00:41:14,099 --> 00:41:20,040
but whatever but I can tell you this

998
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:22,020
and I'm just just being honest okay

999
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:24,780
viruses are alive

1000
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:27,420
viruses eat classified medical research

1001
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:30,540
and science raised

1002
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:32,940
the Spanish Flu they raised that variety

1003
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:35,220
of influenza in a lab

1004
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:37,440
and they released it

1005
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:39,839
and that's why it killed that many

1006
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:44,040
people on the planet

1007
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:46,740
it was engineered and it did exist and

1008
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:49,680
people did die in 1918.

1009
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:52,380
and it is what it is

1010
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:54,540
but I get it if you don't believe that I

1011
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:56,280
hope you stay around anyway hang out

1012
00:41:54,540 --> 00:42:00,540
have some fun

1013
00:41:56,280 --> 00:42:02,040
and we'll still talk cool stuff here

1014
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:03,780
all right

1015
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:06,540
but listen I hope you actually learned

1016
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:09,119
the good information and then

1017
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:11,460
so you have that

1018
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:13,440
the brain houses a complex spiritual

1019
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:15,060
Network it also houses a complex

1020
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:17,040
physical Network

1021
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:18,300
I wonder what Dr Nesbitt would say about

1022
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:20,579
that comment

1023
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:22,740
which requires absolute Purity to the

1024
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:25,380
highest degree it can't be that expired

1025
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:27,420
piece official I was talking about

1026
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:29,160
I get it to try and discount all the

1027
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:32,280
people who've lost their lives is really

1028
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:33,720
sad trying to rewrite histories another

1029
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:35,160
thing too because what I've seen out

1030
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:38,460
there is people

1031
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:40,859
constantly rewrite history

1032
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:42,540
and then discount all the suffering that

1033
00:42:40,859 --> 00:42:44,520
happened right is that what's going to

1034
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:46,260
happen now oh my God

1035
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:47,760
is that where we're going

1036
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:50,579
all the people with neurological

1037
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:52,320
symptoms that are like bedridden on

1038
00:42:50,579 --> 00:42:53,640
mattress Island right now you know how

1039
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:55,500
many people have neurological fatigue

1040
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:58,200
they can't even function

1041
00:42:55,500 --> 00:43:00,060
there's just like suffering the worst

1042
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:03,359
Panic the worst anxiety they can't even

1043
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:06,859
function they're wasting away

1044
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:06,859
is it all in their head too

1045
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:11,520
should I be laughing my ass off at them

1046
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:13,140
is that what I should be doing should I

1047
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:14,400
laugh my ass off at like all the people

1048
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:17,420
that are suffering and sick with

1049
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,420
neurological problems

1050
00:43:18,119 --> 00:43:22,800
no

1051
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:22,800
duh

1052
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:32,819
all right

1053
00:43:29,819 --> 00:43:36,540
let's move on ready we can't look at her

1054
00:43:32,819 --> 00:43:40,319
brain and know if our brain is going bad

1055
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:42,359
from cologne perfume

1056
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:44,640
scented candles air fresheners and toxic

1057
00:43:42,359 --> 00:43:47,040
heavy metals when our brains starts to

1058
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:50,520
develop problems we don't see a symptom

1059
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:52,500
or experience a condition quite yet so

1060
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:54,180
what happens is our brain ends up taking

1061
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:56,040
all these metals and all these different

1062
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:57,420
chemicals and all these different toxins

1063
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:59,400
and all the pharmaceutical pollution

1064
00:43:57,420 --> 00:44:01,740
right our brain takes it all in and

1065
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:04,859
absorbs it all in you guys but we don't

1066
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:06,060
really know anything yet we don't know

1067
00:44:04,859 --> 00:44:08,400
anything yet we don't really

1068
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:10,560
experiencing really anything yet it

1069
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:12,839
takes time for those cells to really get

1070
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:14,520
soaked up and get those toxins and

1071
00:44:12,839 --> 00:44:16,500
poison soaked up

1072
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:19,200
when our brain starts to develop

1073
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:21,119
problems we don't see a symptom or

1074
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:23,460
experience a condition quite yet we

1075
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:25,440
can't open our skull

1076
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:27,420
like an egg

1077
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:29,520
take a look inside

1078
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:31,319
and take a sniff to find out if it's

1079
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:34,040
gone rotten like a piece of fish has

1080
00:44:31,319 --> 00:44:34,040
gone rotten

1081
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:39,180
can't use visual clues or our sense of

1082
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:42,180
smell

1083
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:44,579
like we can with that egg or a piece of

1084
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:46,500
fish that rotten egg to determine if our

1085
00:44:44,579 --> 00:44:48,240
brain is getting toxic or dirty you

1086
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:50,880
can't crack somebody's head open like an

1087
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:52,680
egg sniff it and be like oh it's rotten

1088
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:54,960
in there

1089
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:57,300
only when we start to develop symptoms

1090
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:59,280
from a brain that's been suffering for

1091
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:00,900
weeks or months or years do we start to

1092
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:03,119
get a clue about what's going on inside

1093
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:05,819
but I got a message for the person who

1094
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:08,460
was talking about the Spanish Flu always

1095
00:45:05,819 --> 00:45:11,220
remember okay and this is just

1096
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:12,720
being honest and I'm trying to listen to

1097
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:14,160
Spirit of compassion because he said to

1098
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:15,480
me

1099
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:19,859
he said

1100
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:23,400
be nice aw don't get sarcastic

1101
00:45:19,859 --> 00:45:24,480
don't get defensive and stick up for the

1102
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:27,240
information

1103
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:31,040
Spirit of compassion said just tell her

1104
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:31,040
if she gets really sick down the road

1105
00:45:31,079 --> 00:45:34,800
take the medical medium books to your

1106
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:36,119
doctor or practitioner have them help

1107
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:38,520
you through it

1108
00:45:36,119 --> 00:45:41,780
but the information is for

1109
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:41,780
that person down the road

1110
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:49,819
so let's keep on going a little bit

1111
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:58,500
Kimberly Kobe says which juicer is best

1112
00:45:55,460 --> 00:46:01,500
all-around celery at all

1113
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:01,500
hmm

1114
00:46:05,150 --> 00:46:15,690
[Music]

1115
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:28,200
the mm-1500 which does a whole bunch of

1116
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:30,599
stuff

1117
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:32,880
I talked all about it and the mm-900

1118
00:46:30,599 --> 00:46:34,440
which is an incredible juicer and it

1119
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:36,660
saves money

1120
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:40,819
you guys know the whole thing it saves

1121
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:40,819
money for real incredible juicers

1122
00:46:41,339 --> 00:46:46,800
but it has to be the mm-1500 or the

1123
00:46:43,319 --> 00:46:48,300
mm-900 can't be just any juicer and you

1124
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:50,220
will be surprised it'll be so great

1125
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:52,560
you'll save money in the whole bit I

1126
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:54,839
endorse them and just told you guys all

1127
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:57,500
about them and everything

1128
00:46:54,839 --> 00:46:57,500
all right

1129
00:46:58,859 --> 00:47:04,079
what's he talking about celery juice

1130
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:05,819
okay let's go no but I appreciate you

1131
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:07,619
asking that anyway and I'm not making

1132
00:47:05,819 --> 00:47:09,660
fun of you on any level it's just that I

1133
00:47:07,619 --> 00:47:10,740
always tell you guys I always get

1134
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:13,200
punished

1135
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:15,240
for when I bring out the juicer a whole

1136
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:17,760
bunch of people attack me and say there

1137
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:19,560
he is with his juicer it's like oh my

1138
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:21,599
God it's like they can't tell you how

1139
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:23,819
many people DM and everything else and

1140
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:26,460
ask like where's the best juicer or how

1141
00:47:23,819 --> 00:47:28,800
do I juice celery where's the juicer

1142
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:30,540
sale like I get asked it 100 times and

1143
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:33,660
then I go like three four months without

1144
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:36,119
even mentioning the juicer and then

1145
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:37,680
the community buys a juicer that doesn't

1146
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:39,180
save the money out there and they're

1147
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:40,560
spending all this money on produce and

1148
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:42,359
going broke and it's the saddest thing

1149
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:44,220
I've ever seen so now I have to talk

1150
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:47,300
about it more in order to make sure if

1151
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:47,300
people don't get ripped off

1152
00:47:47,579 --> 00:47:50,940
all right

1153
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:52,380
see guys we're talking about some really

1154
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:55,160
cool information right here I'm really

1155
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:55,160
excited about this

1156
00:47:55,800 --> 00:48:00,420
Jennifer Leonard says it's okay aw

1157
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:01,980
remember there's a lot of people still

1158
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:03,599
hearing about you for the first time

1159
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:06,300
you're right Jennifer you're right

1160
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:07,800
you're right and that is so cool and

1161
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:09,000
you're on Facebook that is so cool to

1162
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:12,000
say because I'm going to tell you right

1163
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:14,160
now that why that's so cool because

1164
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,380
that's why I repeat myself

1165
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:18,900
that's why I repeat myself

1166
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:20,700
so many people punish me for re they

1167
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:24,240
scold me and scold me for repeating

1168
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:26,099
myself and and the reason why I do that

1169
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:28,280
is because of the new people coming on

1170
00:48:26,099 --> 00:48:28,280
board

1171
00:48:30,599 --> 00:48:34,380
only when we start to develop symptoms

1172
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:36,300
from a brain that's been suffering for

1173
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:37,859
weeks or months or years do we start to

1174
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:40,140
get a clue about what's going on inside

1175
00:48:37,859 --> 00:48:42,480
and the clue you guys is not in medical

1176
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:43,980
research and science I have not seen it

1177
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:45,540
so many people suffering with symptoms

1178
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:48,119
conditions and they still don't know

1179
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:50,220
what's going inside the brain the brain

1180
00:48:48,119 --> 00:48:52,740
saver books are actually able to clear

1181
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:54,000
that up which is really important and do

1182
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:55,560
you have the brain Jennifer do you have

1183
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:58,280
the brain saver books

1184
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:58,280
right here

1185
00:48:58,619 --> 00:49:02,579
if you don't have the 26 dollars because

1186
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:04,560
they're over 40 off on Amazon go to the

1187
00:49:02,579 --> 00:49:05,880
library and get them for free everybody

1188
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:08,700
if you go to the library and get them

1189
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:10,500
for free I used to go to I haven't this

1190
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:14,040
year been able to do this but I used to

1191
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:16,140
load up a van and I used to drop books

1192
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:18,359
off at libraries and then I would go

1193
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:20,640
literally in different counties and then

1194
00:49:18,359 --> 00:49:22,619
in different states and I would do that

1195
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:24,780
it was just exhausting and really hard

1196
00:49:22,619 --> 00:49:26,460
to do but go to your library ask for the

1197
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:28,560
book

1198
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:30,720
and try to get the book as you know from

1199
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:33,660
the previous chapters the electricity of

1200
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:36,060
your brain is meant to be clean

1201
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:38,220
your electrical Grid in your brain

1202
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:40,140
you've got a wine glass in front of the

1203
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:42,180
brain here

1204
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:45,020
your electrical Grid in your brain is

1205
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:45,020
meant to be clean

1206
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:50,280
the fluid of your brain

1207
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:52,740
right the spinal fluid is meant to be

1208
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:55,200
clean the blood in your brain is meant

1209
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:58,200
to be clean you guys on page 51 and so

1210
00:49:55,200 --> 00:50:00,480
your liver your brain's best friend is

1211
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:02,460
working overtime to keep poisons out of

1212
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:05,640
your brain so your brain doesn't have to

1213
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:07,980
become the filter and yet life here on

1214
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:10,079
planet Earth doesn't work so ideally

1215
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:11,640
because our livers get so overloaded

1216
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:13,560
like I was telling you before our brains

1217
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:16,040
get saturated with poisons from all the

1218
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:18,359
areas and angles including prescription

1219
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:19,560
Pharmaceuticals that are supposedly for

1220
00:50:18,359 --> 00:50:20,780
the brain

1221
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:22,859
foreign

1222
00:50:20,780 --> 00:50:24,720
toxic heavy metals preservatives

1223
00:50:22,859 --> 00:50:27,060
chemicals caffeine and more that you'll

1224
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:29,460
read about in these books

1225
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:31,140
the brain is meant to be a sponge for

1226
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:34,260
knowledge

1227
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:38,099
so your brain is meant to be that sponge

1228
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:42,500
for information and knowledge

1229
00:50:38,099 --> 00:50:42,500
instead it becomes a sponge for waste

1230
00:50:43,859 --> 00:50:47,460
as blood is pumped to the brain it is

1231
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:49,619
blood that's filled with many different

1232
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:52,200
toxins

1233
00:50:49,619 --> 00:50:54,180
the publicly known medical field doesn't

1234
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:56,280
want any part in knowing this because

1235
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:58,079
the last thing it needs is to learn

1236
00:50:56,280 --> 00:51:00,300
about the poisons that enter our brains

1237
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:03,300
as you know that if the publicly known

1238
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:04,020
medical research and Science World finds

1239
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:05,940
out

1240
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:09,480
they learn

1241
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:13,220
what's poisoning our brains

1242
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:13,220
that's a little crazy and a little scary

1243
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:17,460
because if they learn that

1244
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:19,380
they have to shut up they don't want to

1245
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:21,599
learn that because they can't speak out

1246
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:24,240
if they ever learn that that would

1247
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:25,740
expose the crimes the neglect and the

1248
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:27,960
agendas of the classified medical

1249
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:31,339
industry and maybe even the wizard that

1250
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:31,339
puppeteers it all

1251
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:35,819
that's incredible

1252
00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:38,160
notably some of the poisons that get

1253
00:51:35,819 --> 00:51:40,020
through to the brain are viral toxins is

1254
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:42,599
which why so many people are sick

1255
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:44,940
they're sick to death of being sick and

1256
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:48,000
they're sick

1257
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:49,020
viral toxins including viral neurotoxins

1258
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,240
remember I was talking about that

1259
00:51:49,020 --> 00:51:52,980
earlier viral neurotoxins from the virus

1260
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:55,559
eating so what I was trying to tell you

1261
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:59,780
guys is I'll make it really

1262
00:51:55,559 --> 00:51:59,780
easy breezy almost drop my egg

1263
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:06,119
okay

1264
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:08,280
the virus

1265
00:52:06,119 --> 00:52:10,200
inside people's bodies or viruses

1266
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:12,839
whether it's Epstein bars herpes simplex

1267
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:14,819
one herpes simplex 2 hhv6 shingles virus

1268
00:52:12,839 --> 00:52:16,859
hhv7

1269
00:52:14,819 --> 00:52:20,040
whether whatever varieties and strains

1270
00:52:16,859 --> 00:52:22,859
of them loves to feed on the food it

1271
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:25,680
releases a neurotoxin that neurotoxin

1272
00:52:22,859 --> 00:52:26,579
goes to the brain short circuits the

1273
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:28,800
brain

1274
00:52:26,579 --> 00:52:32,180
and makes it so we suffer and struggle

1275
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:32,180
with symptoms and conditions

1276
00:52:34,859 --> 00:52:37,440
anybody want to have a couple eggs with

1277
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:39,119
me later

1278
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:40,500
crack them open or fry them up how do

1279
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:43,020
you like your eggs

1280
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:45,720
scrambled fried

1281
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:49,160
poached

1282
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:49,160
I'll make some eggs for everybody

1283
00:52:49,859 --> 00:52:53,579
the new people here will be like oh my

be incredible

1286
00:52:55,980 --> 00:53:00,859
Egg party

1287
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:00,859
okay

1288
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:06,960
the virus is giving off these toxins

1289
00:53:05,339 --> 00:53:09,180
usually come from elsewhere in the body

1290
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:10,740
they may reside in the liver lymphatic

1291
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:12,839
system spleen intestinal tract

1292
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:15,720
reproductive system nervous system and

1293
00:53:12,839 --> 00:53:18,000
even the skeletal skeletal system

1294
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:19,440
I gotta learn to read better you guys

1295
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,780
have you checked out medical meme

1296
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:24,119

viruses can Nest inside somebody's bone

1304
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:42,540
marrow

1305
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:45,119
where many toxic heavy metals such as

1306
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:47,700
mercury reside and settle this is one of

1307
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:49,619
the foundations of blood cell and bone

1308
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:52,079
marrow disease

1309
00:53:49,619 --> 00:53:54,240
mainly the viruses reside in the liver

1310
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:57,000
though but they do end up in the bones

1311
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:58,920
too for so many people

1312
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:01,079
this is cool right here you guys check

1313
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:03,300
it out as I mentioned earlier these

1314
00:54:01,079 --> 00:54:05,700
herpetic viruses range from Epstein-Barr

1315
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:08,420
virus I was known as the Epstein-Barr

1316
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:10,380
guy I was

1317
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:12,420
ostracized and made fun of and

1318
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:14,400
discriminated discriminated against

1319
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:18,300
because I was known as the Epstein-Barr

1320
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:19,980
guy and then years and years later

1321
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:20,780
people are using the Epstein-Barr

1322
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:24,020
information

1323
00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:24,020
what happened

1324
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:28,020
they range from Epstein-Barr virus and

1325
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:29,280
it's over 60 varieties to shingles and

1326
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:31,740
it's over 30 varieties of

1327
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:34,980
cytomegalovirus what

1328
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:39,000
CMV and it's many varieties to multiple

1329
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:40,800
varieties of human herpes 6 hhv6 to well

1330
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:44,099
over a dozen varieties of herpes simplex

1331
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:46,140
and a hundreds of the hhv varieties and

1332
00:54:44,099 --> 00:54:47,880
mutations most of which are undiscovered

1333
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:48,720
by publicly known medical research and

1334
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:52,859
science

1335
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:56,760
classified medical research and science

1336
00:54:52,859 --> 00:54:58,619
let the viruses out of the running gate

1337
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:59,520
publicly known medical research and

1338
00:54:58,619 --> 00:55:01,800
science

1339
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:05,760
stumble across certain varieties of

1340
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:08,720
viruses by chance like the Epstein-Barr

1341
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:08,720

with like the skit I do at the beginning

1361
00:55:50,599 --> 00:55:54,599
someone put a comment out the other day

1362
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:57,240
saying

1363
00:55:54,599 --> 00:55:59,579
I lost all credibility because during

1364
00:55:57,240 --> 00:56:03,300
the wild blueberry challenge

1365
00:55:59,579 --> 00:56:05,339

blueberry drinks challenge reading out a

1420
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:09,300
brain saver right now

1421
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:12,839
I just want to read a couple more

1422
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:15,599
sentences check this out neurotoxins 101

1423
00:58:12,839 --> 00:58:19,079
so what are neurotoxins neurotoxins are

1424
00:58:15,599 --> 00:58:22,800
a thing produced it's a toxic waste

1425
00:58:19,079 --> 00:58:23,940
produced by viruses released in our

1426
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:27,780
bloodstream and throughout our body

1427
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:31,260
these neurotoxins land on phrenic nerves

1428
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:34,559
they land on vagus nerves

1429
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:37,020
they land on trigeminal nerves

1430
00:58:34,559 --> 00:58:39,420
have a glossal nerves

1431
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:41,760
they land on all our different nerves

1432
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:43,500
cranial nerves and they give us all

1433
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:45,240
these mystery symptoms that can make us

1434
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:48,059
feel like we're crazy

1435
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:50,339
and make us really sick they could also

1436
00:58:48,059 --> 00:58:53,220
saturate the brain making us feel like

1437
00:58:50,339 --> 00:58:56,099
we have this fatigue where our legs feel

1438
00:58:53,220 --> 00:58:58,500
like lead and our arms feel like lead

1439
00:58:56,099 --> 00:59:00,420
so that's what neurotoxins can do and

1440
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:03,000
they're produced from viruses like

1441
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:05,579
Epstein-Barr virus hhv6 said

1442
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:08,579
omegalovirus they're produced by viruses

1443
00:59:05,579 --> 00:59:09,960
the most common neurotoxins culprits

1444
00:59:08,579 --> 00:59:11,460
come from your garden variety

1445
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:14,579
Epstein-Barr which everybody has

1446
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:16,980
shingles everyone at this point in time

1447
00:59:14,579 --> 00:59:18,440
has at least one form of Epstein-Barr

1448
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:20,640
and shingles living inside their body

1449
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:22,799
these viruses can produce large

1450
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:24,599
quantities of neurotoxins giving people

1451
00:59:22,799 --> 00:59:26,579
so many symptoms and conditions it's

1452
00:59:24,599 --> 00:59:29,400
incredible

1453
00:59:26,579 --> 00:59:32,280
and then because of that people end up

1454
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:35,400
having so many problems but we need to

1455
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:36,720
learn how to fix it how to get our

1456
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:39,059
symptoms better

1457
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:40,980
we need to learn what to do how to clean

1458
00:59:39,059 --> 00:59:42,900
up the neurotoxins how to kill off the

1459
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:45,059
viruses how to beat them down how to

1460
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:47,220
beat them how to clean up how to restore

1461
00:59:45,059 --> 00:59:48,960
our central nervous system how to make

1462
00:59:47,220 --> 00:59:50,460
ourselves stronger how to make our

1463
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:52,619
