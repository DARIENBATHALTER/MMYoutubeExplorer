[180.02 - 184.08] professionals were taught to avoid the
[183.00 - 187.68] avocado
[184.08 - 189.18] in medical school it wasn't first of all
[187.68 - 190.92] you guys know in medical school I've
[189.18 - 191.70] talked to hundreds of doctors over the
[190.92 - 193.80] years
[191.70 - 196.86] in medical school they didn't teach you
[193.80 - 198.84] about food and diet right we know that
[196.86 - 200.46] and they don't don't get fooled they
[198.84 - 202.02] still don't teach it now I don't care
[200.46 - 204.18] what any but doctor says I talked to
[202.02 - 206.88] doctor just graduated recently and said
[204.18 - 208.50] what they teach about food men and
[206.88 - 210.66] everything and diet and I was like oh
[208.50 - 213.24] yeah that's really great and lame as
[210.66 - 214.02]  it was terrible so check this out
[213.24 - 218.06] right
[214.02 - 220.86] in medical school right all these years
[218.06 - 223.26] instead of just teaching about food
[220.86 - 226.04] which they didn't like having at least
[223.26 - 229.08] some courses in that Medical University
[226.04 - 231.60] instead of doing that they said stay
[229.08 - 234.66] away from avocado it's toxic it's
[231.60 - 237.24] poisonous it's toxic it's bad for you
[234.66 - 239.34] that's what they said that was the
[237.24 - 242.34] training I talk about it in the episode
[239.34 - 246.06] understand why the avocado went from a
[242.34 - 249.66] feared food feared man you guys need to
[246.06 - 251.70] know the avocado was feared it was beard
[249.66 - 253.56] I'm serious I'm just being straight out
[251.70 - 256.80] about this this is no joke right here
[253.56 - 259.14] feared food to to all of a sudden now

[267.36 - 273.54] restaurants used to not sell guacamole

[308.28 - 312.84] Episode by the way Mexican restaurants
[310.38 - 314.76] did not sell guacamole because no one
[312.84 - 316.88] ate it and no one liked it and no one
[314.76 - 320.04] cared about it so they wouldn't buy
[316.88 - 322.56] avocados and then try to make guacamole
[320.04 - 324.84] and let it sit and rot when a mama pop
[322.56 - 328.02] Mexican restaurant needs to survive
[324.84 - 329.76] dollars and cents count for survival to
[328.02 - 331.50] pay the help to keep the restaurant in
[329.76 - 333.54] business right
[331.50 - 335.52] and no one was eating guacamole they
[333.54 - 337.14] would make guacamole no one would eat it
[335.52 - 339.30] Mexican restaurants did not sell
[337.14 - 341.10] guacamole I'm just letting you know they
[339.30 - 343.68] did not sell avocado it was not on the

[379.32 - 383.70] times not to when you are sick
[382.26 - 387.72] what
[383.70 - 390.84] if you're sick learn how to use avocado
[387.72 - 393.60] and learn how sometimes to not use
[390.84 - 395.64] avocado people always say to me now
[393.60 - 397.92] they're like you hate avocado aw you're
[395.64 - 399.96] against fats fats fats fats you don't
[397.92 - 401.22] even like healthy fats you're bad you
[399.96 - 403.02] don't know what you're talking about aw
[401.22 - 405.42] you don't know anything about health aw
[403.02 - 407.94] you're not a doctor
[405.42 - 410.76] right meanwhile no
[407.94 - 412.62] as I said in the podcast I was pushing
[410.76 - 414.42] avocados and getting the beat out
[412.62 - 417.24] of me over it because people were saying
[414.42 - 418.92] you wouldn't believe I was in I was in a
[417.24 - 421.44] big health food store many many many
[418.92 - 424.80] years ago like close to 30 years ago
[421.44 - 426.72] doing a presentation on Avocado right
[424.80 - 429.18] because that health food store actually
[426.72 - 431.70] got a bunch of avocados because it was
[429.18 - 433.50] rare you couldn't find them you couldn't
[431.70 - 436.74] buy them anywhere
[433.50 - 439.50] right and I did a presentation and some
[436.74 - 441.66] guy went bananas he went berserk and he
[439.50 - 444.00] knocked over everything and he kicked
[441.66 - 446.16] the avocados down the aisle and he just
[444.00 - 447.78] he went crazy because he said they were
[446.16 - 450.06] toxic and poisonous and that's what he
[447.78 - 451.62] learned in Alternative Health you guys
[450.06 - 454.44] need to know something in alternative
[451.62 - 456.20] medicine you weren't allowed to touch an
[454.44 - 458.22] avocado in Chinese medicine
[456.20 - 460.20] acupuncturists would never allow you to
[458.22 - 462.24] eat an avocado
[460.20 - 464.22] that's what it was like and guess what
[462.24 - 466.14] no one's held accountable never never
[464.22 - 468.06] instead everybody's just an expert you
[466.14 - 469.98] just go with the trendy times and go
[468.06 - 471.84] along and now you're an expert doesn't
[469.98 - 473.58] matter what kind of crap you created
[471.84 - 474.96] back 10 years ago in your life or 20
[473.58 - 477.60] years ago and you're like no one's held
[474.96 - 480.12] accountable at least corrected no one
[477.60 - 482.46] right and instead they change they morph
[480.12 - 484.14] like a chameleon they morph like a
[482.46 - 485.94] chameleon and they shed their skin like
[484.14 - 488.76] a snake and that's what people do they
[485.94 - 490.80] shed their skin like a snake oh I was
[488.76 - 493.26] telling you that three years ago oh no
[490.80 - 495.12] that's not me now watch my new posts on
[493.26 - 497.34] social media here's what I'm doing now
[495.12 - 500.10] oh sorry I led you the wrong way years
[497.34 - 502.20] ago because I'm a snake and I shed my
[500.10 - 503.88] skin that's what I did I'm gonna shed my
[502.20 - 505.56] skin like a snake because that's what I
[503.88 - 507.06] am I'm a snake and I'm gonna trick a
[505.56 - 509.16] whole bunch of other people and we'll go
[507.06 - 511.26] down a different path and then I'll shed
[509.16 - 512.88] the skin I'll be like oh hey everybody I
[511.26 - 514.62] just put out a new post this is what I'm
[512.88 - 516.60] doing now don't worry about those
[514.62 - 519.72] YouTubes I did five years ago that were
[516.60 - 522.24] completely contradictive and different
[519.72 - 525.18] anyway
[522.24 - 527.70] I had too much avocado that's probably
[525.18 - 532.14] what it is today right Lisa said it was

[587.88 - 592.50] that's what they do right so avocados
[590.22 - 594.36] right every time I would hold up an
[592.50 - 595.92] avocado years ago because I've been
[594.36 - 598.32] doing this for over 30 years every time
[595.92 - 600.36] I would hold up an avocado
[598.32 - 602.22] and say this is something you guys
[600.36 - 604.44] should eat this is something somebody
[602.22 - 608.40] should eat it was always kicked out of
[604.44 - 612.54] my hand basically it was considered
[608.40 - 614.46]  legit you guys for real okay it
[612.54 - 616.20] took a lot of years teaching a lot of
[614.46 - 618.48] people and you guys know I talk to a lot
[616.20 - 620.04] of people throughout the decades and how
[618.48 - 621.78] to teach that many people in health I
[620.04 - 624.72] can't tell you how many people that are
[621.78 - 626.46] actually now people people need options
[624.72 - 627.78] to get off of other heavy foods and I'm
[626.46 - 630.12] going to cover that in the next moment
[627.78 - 632.76] but I want you to know right
[630.12 - 634.14] that I taught a lot of people in the
[632.76 - 637.26] health industry that you'd be very
[634.14 - 638.76] surprised to know right that are older
[637.26 - 641.22] now
[638.76 - 643.80] that were staying away from avocado in
[641.22 - 645.66] the Alternative Health field
[643.80 - 647.10] that I taught throughout the decades to
[645.66 - 649.26] do avocados
[647.10 - 650.88] and to talk about them and to preach
[649.26 - 653.22] about them and lecture about them and
[650.88 - 654.72] get the word out that's how much work I
[653.22 - 658.80] had to do
[654.72 - 661.38] and right it is what it is
[658.80 - 663.30] Lynn Fouts good to see you
[661.38 - 665.34] um I love the message at the end of the
[663.30 - 667.50] avocado podcast extremely empowering
[665.34 - 668.82] knowing how food empowers you and
[667.50 - 671.28] assists you
[668.82 - 673.38] and assist you for who you are when one
[671.28 - 675.84] follows what the body needs via mm
[673.38 - 677.82] information thank you with gratitude you
[675.84 - 681.18] guys I'm making a guacamole but but a
[677.82 - 683.58] medicinal guacamole see now avocado what
[681.18 - 685.50] what we're talking about here now what
[683.58 - 687.96] you'll hear in the podcast episode is
[685.50 - 691.38] it's an incredible transition food this
[687.96 - 693.48] is a transition tool this is to get you
[691.38 - 696.12] off of a bad fat right
[693.48 - 698.46] is to get you off of a bad fat and in
[696.12 - 700.14] the episode I talk about how the fat in
[698.46 - 702.12] an avocado is different and has nothing
[700.14 - 704.82] to do with Omega-3s sixes and nines and
[702.12 - 706.02] that whole BS thing it has nothing to do
[704.82 - 708.96] with that
[706.02 - 710.70] the fat is a different viscosity it
[708.96 - 712.68] keeps the blood a little thinner and
[710.70 - 715.38] that's the reason why it's an incredible
[712.68 - 718.32] transition tool to get you off of the
[715.38 - 720.00] bad fats not about Omega-3s and omega-6s
[718.32 - 721.38] it's not about that I know the vegan
[720.00 - 723.96] doctors are talking about that now
[721.38 - 726.06] because they have a theory
[723.96 - 729.42] from studies that always get proven
[726.06 - 730.62] wrong over and over and over again I
[729.42 - 733.14] don't know if you guys have ever noticed
[730.62 - 735.00] that constantly in medicine both
[733.14 - 736.98] alternative and conventional the
[735.00 - 738.90] theories come out the trend goes around
[736.98 - 740.88] and then it gets debunked and then they
[738.90 - 742.92] found out it was wasn't even studied it
[740.88 - 745.08] wasn't even proven and then boom on to a
[742.92 - 747.12] new Theory then on to a new Theory the
[745.08 - 750.30] big Theory now is omega-6s are the bad
[747.12 - 752.34] ones that's the bad ones right so an
[750.30 - 754.14] avocado has a bag of six in it right but
[752.34 - 755.76] avocados are still incredible for you
[754.14 - 759.30] right it's always contradicting
[755.76 - 762.96] contradicting the point is is the fat in
[759.30 - 765.12] avocado is thinner they don't know that
[762.96 - 767.88] part science research food science does
[765.12 - 770.46] not know the avocado fat is thinner the
[767.88 - 773.28] viscosity is different and because of
[770.46 - 775.80] that and because it has sugar in it with
[773.28 - 778.62] it combined so it's Nature's way of
[775.80 - 781.92] putting sugar and fat together the right
[778.62 - 784.50] way right because of that it's healthier
[781.92 - 787.98] there's a healthier reason for the that
[784.50 - 790.14] it's less of a thicker fat it has a
[787.98 - 793.02] different viscosity it's got a thinner
[790.14 - 794.34] nature to it it allows sugar to do its
[793.02 - 796.14] thing because there's sugar in the
[794.34 - 799.38] avocado as well but it's an incredible
[796.14 - 802.56] transition tool too to getting someone
[799.38 - 804.72] off of the bacon off of the eggs off of
[802.56 - 806.64] the dairy products off of the cheese off
[804.72 - 809.22] of the meat off of all that kind of
[806.64 - 811.68] stuff the avocado is a transition tool
[809.22 - 813.30] to get you off of the bad stuff and
[811.68 - 815.06] that's what I talked about all these
[813.30 - 818.04] years I'd be like
[815.06 - 820.86] avocado get rid of that block of cheese
[818.04 - 822.48] move that block of cheese out and bring
[820.86 - 825.42] in the avocado
[822.48 - 827.94] red eye banana aw well avocado combined
[825.42 - 829.86] with potatoes cause insulin resistance
[827.94 - 832.44] depends on healthy your liver is okay
[829.86 - 834.60] all depends on how over the years your
[832.44 - 836.40] liver's been beaten down stagnant
[834.60 - 838.26] sluggish any kinds of problems or
[836.40 - 841.38] anything like that that all depends
[838.26 - 842.88] there too on your liver so
[841.38 - 844.44] if you're somebody and you've been
[842.88 - 846.24] through a lot with your health you got a
[844.44 - 848.70] stagnant sluggish liver you've got weak
[846.24 - 850.92] digestion weak bile reserves you got
[848.70 - 853.02] weak hydrochloric acid right there
[850.92 - 855.18] you're all kinds of buggy you've got
[853.02 - 856.98] pathogens you got toxic heavy metals
[855.18 - 858.90] you're not well you have a lot of
[856.98 - 860.34] different diagnoses or problems or maybe
[858.90 - 862.32] you're just somebody with just weak
[860.34 - 864.06] digestion and in a liver issue right
[862.32 - 865.62] that you don't know about like a
[864.06 - 867.06] pre-fatty liver and you don't even know
[865.62 - 869.28] where you're pre-diabetic and you don't
[867.06 - 871.20] even know it because of your liver then
[869.28 - 873.48] yeah if you put potato and avocado
[871.20 - 876.72] together it's not the best of the best
[873.48 - 878.52] because you're putting a you know a
[876.72 - 880.44] starch and a fat together so when you
[878.52 - 882.60] put starches and fats together you can
[880.44 - 884.64] raise your insulin resistance right but
[882.60 - 885.78] if you gotta if you cleaned up that
[884.64 - 887.94] liver
[885.78 - 889.50] right if your liver's clean and it's not
[887.94 - 891.78] stagnant sluggish and you've got your
[889.50 - 894.18] bile Reserve strong and you got your you
[891.78 - 895.74] got your hydrochloric acid strong in
[894.18 - 898.32] your stomach you've got your gastric
[895.74 - 900.84] glands built up you got your system
[898.32 - 902.94] working really good and you're not
[900.84 - 904.68] bombarding yourself with all these bad
[902.94 - 906.36] fats you're staying off of bacon you're
[904.68 - 907.80] staying off of ham you're staying off a
[906.36 - 912.12] baloney you're staying off a butter
[907.80 - 914.22] cheese milk and then you do avocado
[912.12 - 915.78] with potato you're not going to get the
[914.22 - 917.28] insulin resistance but if you're
[915.78 - 918.66] somebody that's you're already that
[917.28 - 920.34] sensitive and you've been through a lot
[918.66 - 921.84] and you're trying to and you're move you
[920.34 - 923.22] know and you're on these other also
[921.84 - 925.02] you're doing all these other bad fats
[923.22 - 927.90] sure you'll just get insulin resistance
[925.02 - 930.30] because that's what happens
[927.90 - 931.68] so that's kind of a quick explanation of
[930.30 - 934.02] that let's start making a guacamole
[931.68 - 936.12] Renata says I see some people using that
[934.02 - 938.76] combination as a detox cleansing tool
[936.12 - 941.52] that's why I'm asking it's not a detox
[938.76 - 943.32] cleansing tool when you put
[941.52 - 948.84] a fat
[943.32 - 952.02] right a fat with any kind of starch
[948.84 - 954.24] right or you put a fat in the diet let's
[952.02 - 955.56] just take it that down that direction a
[954.24 - 957.84] little bit okay now you're talking about
[955.56 - 961.20] something a little bit more complicated
[957.84 - 964.80] here it is if you're going to eat fats
[961.20 - 968.70] milk cheese butter eggs nuts nut Butters
[964.80 - 973.86] nut milks avocados right peanut butter
[968.70 - 978.12] oils meat chicken lamb turkey whatever
[973.86 - 982.20] eggs if you eat any fat you can't
[978.12 - 986.52] cleanse so your body doesn't cleanse or
[982.20 - 990.24] cleanses very little very little if
[986.52 - 992.58] you're doing a fat right so but it
[990.24 - 994.68] depends how many fats are you doing and
[992.58 - 995.76] what kind of fats are you doing right if
[994.68 - 998.28] you're only doing a little bit of
[995.76 - 1000.80] avocado every other day or a little bit
[998.28 - 1003.68] of avocado each week you've got a better
[1000.80 - 1006.98] chance of cleansing all in between but
[1003.68 - 1009.02] yet avocado is the best fat Source one
[1006.98 - 1011.42] of the best tools one of the best fruits
[1009.02 - 1014.48] to use if you're trying to cleanse in
[1011.42 - 1016.58] between but always know that fats in
[1014.48 - 1017.96] general of all kinds stop the body to
[1016.58 - 1020.36] cleanse that's why you have to listen to
[1017.96 - 1022.58] the podcast you guys get a chance listen
[1020.36 - 1025.64] to the podcast avocado or you avocado
[1022.58 - 1028.34] toast because I talk about how if we
[1025.64 - 1029.84] have fats in our system we can't cleanse
[1028.34 - 1031.94] and heal and that's why sometimes it's
[1029.84 - 1034.04] best not to eat the avocado if you're
[1031.94 - 1036.56] sick struggling chronic illness in your
[1034.04 - 1039.98] suffering that's when we don't use the
[1036.56 - 1042.68] avocado right but it's a great cool to
[1039.98 - 1044.66] transition people away from the bad fats
[1042.68 - 1047.48] that are really preventing problems get
[1044.66 - 1050.18] them on a good fat that's going to help
[1047.48 - 1052.22] them transition and that's the
[1050.18 - 1054.20] difference Uma Cali that's true avocados
[1052.22 - 1056.66] helped me to transition from eating lots
[1054.20 - 1057.86] of nuts avocado is much easier to digest
[1056.66 - 1061.10] that's exactly what we're talking about
[1057.86 - 1063.08] anyway thank you for that really good
[1061.10 - 1066.62] wisdom you have
[1063.08 - 1069.74] amazing right it's a fruit that's why
[1066.62 - 1071.72] it's a fruit and that's why which is
[1069.74 - 1073.70] incredible I'm making a medicinal
[1071.72 - 1075.68] guacamole that's why I'm here we're
[1073.70 - 1077.84] talking about the medical medium podcast
[1075.68 - 1079.82] at Apple podcast right
[1077.84 - 1082.10] so other stuff you'll know get to know
[1079.82 - 1084.08] how the fat from avocado can be used as
[1082.10 - 1086.06] a transition tool on the path to other
[1084.08 - 1087.74] healing tools right we were just talking
[1086.06 - 1090.50] about all of that that's why I wanted to
[1087.74 - 1092.66] read that to you okay see how one person
[1090.50 - 1095.42] may do good on a lot of avocado why
[1092.66 - 1097.64] another person may not how about that
[1095.42 - 1099.56] Michael Charles good to see you removing
[1097.64 - 1101.78] the fats was the key to healing for me
[1099.56 - 1103.70] after six months I brought avocados back
[1101.78 - 1105.92] into the evenings
[1103.70 - 1109.22] boom boom
[1105.92 - 1112.46] thank you brother boom right
[1109.22 - 1114.62] okay see what the deal is about omega-6
[1112.46 - 1116.72] is understand why the medical media
[1114.62 - 1119.84] morning cleanse keeps fats such as
[1116.72 - 1122.18] avocado out of your morning routine
[1119.84 - 1124.70] so that's a whole nother thing too all
[1122.18 - 1127.22] on its own you guys right leave your
[1124.70 - 1129.80] green salads fat to use and not to use
[1127.22 - 1133.10] and I show you the recipe containing
[1129.80 - 1136.04] avocado that is a great substitute when
[1133.10 - 1138.92] a mom can't breastfeed so that's another
[1136.04 - 1141.38] thing too so know that that's in this
[1138.92 - 1144.44] episode is it the moms that can't
[1141.38 - 1147.86] breastfeed how you can use avocado to
[1144.44 - 1149.90] make milk okay and that's the key right
[1147.86 - 1151.58] there so I want you guys to see that I'm
[1149.90 - 1153.14] gonna make some guacamole right now let
[1151.58 - 1157.34] me get working on it
[1153.14 - 1160.58] you guys that's the plan so let's get
[1157.34 - 1162.82] started we need a bowl first and then I
[1160.58 - 1166.66] shall get that bowl now and I am looking
[1162.82 - 1166.66] I have one right here
[1167.18 - 1173.72] so yeah so I got a nice glass bowl which
[1171.56 - 1175.64] I really like for this
[1173.72 - 1179.42] I will get another one
[1175.64 - 1182.32] let's do that so it's really great
[1179.42 - 1182.32] is that
[1182.72 - 1187.64] when you listen to this podcast you guys
[1185.18 - 1189.26] it's got a lot of good information which
[1187.64 - 1191.42] is really good too you know meaning
[1189.26 - 1194.54] overall about the avocado in general
[1191.42 - 1196.78] that's really helpful too so that's
[1194.54 - 1196.78] great
[1196.94 - 1199.72] foreign
[1200.72 - 1206.12] this is why I like doing live all the
[1203.48 - 1207.44] time because I like when things get like
[1206.12 - 1211.22] kind of just
[1207.44 - 1212.72] strange and messed up all right
[1211.22 - 1214.64] I have a bowl
[1212.72 - 1217.22] so we're doing some avocado first things
[1214.64 - 1219.92] first I always tell everybody and I've
[1217.22 - 1221.42] talked about this before too right take
[1219.92 - 1224.38] out the butt right here I just want to
[1221.42 - 1224.38] show you guys real quick
[1224.42 - 1229.52] don't let these fall into your avocado
[1226.40 - 1233.36] dish right there see that
[1229.52 - 1236.42] don't let that fall in whatever you do
[1233.36 - 1239.42] because that's hard as a rock for real
[1236.42 - 1243.26] so if you got company over and Grandma
[1239.42 - 1245.24] comes over and she loses she loses a
[1243.26 - 1246.74] crown or something because she was
[1245.24 - 1248.96] eating your guacamole she's gonna be
[1246.74 - 1251.36] like really pissed so you take off those
[1248.96 - 1253.46] butts right there if you have them on
[1251.36 - 1255.98] there you see so that's really important
[1253.46 - 1258.50] all on its own right
[1255.98 - 1259.40] another thing too what I do is I'll take
[1258.50 - 1261.44] the knife
[1259.40 - 1265.58] and I'll just do this like a billion
[1261.44 - 1268.04] other people probably do and have right
[1265.58 - 1269.96] so I opened it
[1268.04 - 1272.24] there you go
[1269.96 - 1274.10] that now I don't recommend other people
[1272.24 - 1275.48] to do it that way but I always stick the
[1274.10 - 1277.34] knife in there like that that's one
[1275.48 - 1278.66] thing I do and then I just put it right
[1277.34 - 1281.60] here on the counter
[1278.66 - 1284.18] and I twist it and it pops off so if you
[1281.60 - 1287.78] guys see that right there
[1284.18 - 1291.08] so I'm going to make an herb guacamole
[1287.78 - 1295.64] but it's very potent with herbs a lot of
[1291.08 - 1297.86] herbs this is a medicinal version right
[1295.64 - 1300.50] because I like turning this into
[1297.86 - 1303.02] medicine and that's the deal with what
[1300.50 - 1305.12] I'm doing my guacamole I like turning
[1303.02 - 1306.26] turning it into medicine that's what I
[1305.12 - 1308.60] like to do
[1306.26 - 1310.22] I like it nice and medicinal
[1308.60 - 1312.38] that's the uh
[1310.22 - 1313.64] that's the best the best way to do it so
[1312.38 - 1315.74] let's make sure we get it in the middle
[1313.64 - 1317.24] there
[1315.74 - 1320.02] you know and look you got to remember
[1317.24 - 1322.64] the harder the avocado is too right
[1320.02 - 1325.22] never pull a pit off with your hand on
[1322.64 - 1327.80] the knife I'll show you that too so let
[1325.22 - 1330.08] me cut a couple of others now
[1327.80 - 1332.78] I like making a big one when I make one
[1330.08 - 1335.60] so I'm taking another butt off there
[1332.78 - 1337.58] I like making a bigger one
[1335.60 - 1340.04] now when you guys listen to the episode
[1337.58 - 1341.72] there's all kinds of like pieces of
[1340.04 - 1343.34] information in there that might just
[1341.72 - 1345.80] skip by you it's always good to listen
[1343.34 - 1348.26] to these informative podcast episodes
[1345.80 - 1350.00] more than once if you get a chance you
[1348.26 - 1352.04] know that's always a good thing to do
[1350.00 - 1354.92] right
[1352.04 - 1357.14] so never pull the pit off of there with
[1354.92 - 1359.90] your hand I've seen people do this
[1357.14 - 1362.12] and just literally cut their I've seen
[1359.90 - 1364.82] cooking shows out there right
[1362.12 - 1366.26] over the years or watch a cooking show
[1364.82 - 1368.12] or something and I'm like oh what are
[1366.26 - 1369.50] they doing what is that and all of a
[1368.12 - 1370.94] sudden you see somebody actually do that
[1369.50 - 1372.02] and they take their hand and they do
[1370.94 - 1374.18] this
[1372.02 - 1375.80] you don't want to do it that way you're
[1374.18 - 1377.30] you're bound to get cut especially if
[1375.80 - 1378.98] you have a really really sharp knife
[1377.30 - 1380.90] right I put it on the board just like
[1378.98 - 1383.74] that I drop it down like that and I just
[1380.90 - 1383.74] give it a click like
[1384.62 - 1387.38] if you guys just came on here we're
[1386.12 - 1390.14] talking about the medical meme podcast
[1387.38 - 1392.24] avocado or you avocado toast I'm making
[1390.14 - 1393.98] some guacamole right here so I got a
[1392.24 - 1396.68] nice avocado that's a good one there
[1393.98 - 1398.06] don't do the real mushy avocados where
[1396.68 - 1403.40] they're rotten
[1398.06 - 1407.00] right if you buy avocados buy them green
[1403.40 - 1409.34] buy them green great tip
[1407.00 - 1411.74] if you buy them like this there's a
[1409.34 - 1413.42] chance that they're bruised they've been
[1411.74 - 1416.48] squeezed too many times by people
[1413.42 - 1419.48] passing by the you know like people drop
[1416.48 - 1421.16] them on the ground put them back up
[1419.48 - 1423.26] um on the you know on the
[1421.16 - 1426.14] you know shelf right there that's what
[1423.26 - 1429.20] they do so what I recommend is
[1426.14 - 1432.62] buy them green let them ripen
[1429.20 - 1433.88] at home that's what I recommend
[1432.62 - 1435.56] okay
[1433.88 - 1437.74] that's a that's a really pretty one
[1435.56 - 1437.74] right
[1437.90 - 1441.98] and with this right here remember put it
[1439.82 - 1443.30] like that and don't do it by hand never
[1441.98 - 1447.62] do this
[1443.30 - 1449.24] ow never do that right and you put it on
[1447.62 - 1453.50] the board and you just give it a little
[1449.24 - 1455.06] click and there you go comes off
[1453.50 - 1456.62] and look listen
[1455.06 - 1457.94] you don't even have to do this don't
[1456.62 - 1460.70] even do it with a knife because I've
[1457.94 - 1463.34] seen people do this I've seen people who
[1460.70 - 1466.52] just don't have like a good handle on
[1463.34 - 1467.90] doing this kind of thing so and they got
[1466.52 - 1469.28] a really sharp knife and for the first
[1467.90 - 1471.08] time they have a pick here and they end
[1469.28 - 1474.26] up doing this and they miss and they hit
[1471.08 - 1475.40] their hand right like wow like ah and
[1474.26 - 1476.84] then you're on you're going to the
[1475.40 - 1479.42] hospital right so you don't want to do
[1476.84 - 1481.04] that too you want to be careful so I'll
[1479.42 - 1482.42] do one more and you just dig it out with
[1481.04 - 1484.76] a spoon we'll do this little one right
[1482.42 - 1486.02] here here's a small avocado
[1484.76 - 1488.60] right
[1486.02 - 1490.94] so
[1488.60 - 1493.34] there we go
[1490.94 - 1495.02] and you can do a spoon if that's the way
[1493.34 - 1497.18] to do it if you want you can also
[1495.02 - 1498.14] squeeze it if the avocado is Right ripe
[1497.18 - 1499.16] enough because I know a whole bunch of
[1498.14 - 1501.44] people are like why don't you just
[1499.16 - 1503.54] squeeze it aw you know you can do it
[1501.44 - 1507.14] that way too but why don't like that is
[1503.54 - 1509.24] sometimes if the avocado isn't that ripe
[1507.14 - 1511.04] what happens is it ends up you squeeze
[1509.24 - 1513.32] the pit out and you have a lot of the
[1511.04 - 1514.88] avocado on the pit still so that's
[1513.32 - 1516.68] another reason why I don't like doing it
[1514.88 - 1518.42] and I don't when I'm busy and I'm
[1516.68 - 1519.98] cruising and I'm trying to get you know
[1518.42 - 1522.80] things done in time I don't want to be
[1519.98 - 1524.60] trying to like bite it off or take you
[1522.80 - 1527.12] know meat off the pit right it's just
[1524.60 - 1528.86] it's a Time waster so that's why I do it
[1527.12 - 1531.62] the other way so
[1528.86 - 1536.02] let me scoop some avocado in here
[1531.62 - 1536.02] okay now there is a
[1536.12 - 1541.46] myth I call it a myth it's it's really
[1539.06 - 1543.32] you know people put the pits back into
[1541.46 - 1545.06] the bowl to try to keep the avocado
[1543.32 - 1547.64] fresh it doesn't work
[1545.06 - 1550.10] it's it's not that the only way you can
[1547.64 - 1554.54] keep your avocado fresh is if the pit
[1550.10 - 1556.58] wasn't removed out of that half right
[1554.54 - 1559.46] so that's different you can't just make
[1556.58 - 1561.26] a guacamole leaf and then put a pit on
[1559.46 - 1562.76] top of the bowl and expect that to
[1561.26 - 1564.86] actually keep it fresh that's just not
[1562.76 - 1566.78] the way it works right so I'm putting it
[1564.86 - 1569.06] in here you guys could see my halves are
[1566.78 - 1572.06] going in here I'm not counting I'm just
[1569.06 - 1574.46] making a bigger guacamole versus
[1572.06 - 1576.68] um a really small one right
[1574.46 - 1579.14] there we go
[1576.68 - 1581.06] I don't like my avocados mushy I don't
[1579.14 - 1584.78] like them over ripe they can get
[1581.06 - 1587.42] fermented fermented causes trouble a
[1584.78 - 1590.96] fermented avocado is not only disgusting
[1587.42 - 1593.54] it tastes awful not only but it can give
[1590.96 - 1595.82] you a belly ache so a fermented avocado
[1593.54 - 1599.12] can definitely give you a belly ache so
[1595.82 - 1601.82] keep that in mind right so this is a
[1599.12 - 1604.34] very thin skin one right here
[1601.82 - 1608.48] and you'll find some Skins are thicker
[1604.34 - 1610.88] on the avocado some are thinner so
[1608.48 - 1613.04] now some avocado varieties you can eat
[1610.88 - 1615.74] the skin
[1613.04 - 1616.88] some it's not a good idea
[1615.74 - 1618.68] okay
[1616.88 - 1620.48] so you guys if you just came on here
[1618.68 - 1623.18] we're talking about the avocado episode
[1620.48 - 1624.80] I just released check out the link in

[1644.60 - 1649.28] sitting here so um I want to show you
[1647.36 - 1651.74] those herbs too because we're doing a
[1649.28 - 1655.46] medicinal guacamole and this medicinal
[1651.74 - 1659.06] guacamole is about using herbs so it's a
[1655.46 - 1660.80] medicine guacamole right Olivia Lutz yes

[1665.84 - 1673.94] 369 advance for a lifetime yes you can
[1669.50 - 1675.74] 100 accurate information and Powerful
[1673.94 - 1678.68] information for somebody who's been
[1675.74 - 1680.90] really sick chronic illness and it needs
[1678.68 - 1683.60] to heal and they need to be on it for
[1680.90 - 1685.34] years to finally get past what they've
[1683.60 - 1687.92] been fighting in their life their their
[1685.34 - 1690.50] sicknesses and stuff Renata says aw a
[1687.92 - 1692.66] bit of skin went in the bowl yeah I know
[1690.50 - 1695.72] I know you got good eyes you got good
[1692.66 - 1698.18] eyes we will find it if we can I don't
[1695.72 - 1699.74] mind if it's in there it's just that
[1698.18 - 1701.48] you know if you're giving this to
[1699.74 - 1703.16] company or something like that if
[1701.48 - 1705.38] company comes over and they're like why
[1703.16 - 1707.78] is this chewy piece of skin inside my
[1705.38 - 1710.06] guacamole right but yeah it's in there
[1707.78 - 1713.24] somewhere okay
[1710.06 - 1715.16] so let me get a nice Fork right here for
[1713.24 - 1719.48] some mashing
[1715.16 - 1721.28] I will use this one okay now I'm not the
[1719.48 - 1724.34] thing is like what people have to
[1721.28 - 1727.66] understand right is that
[1724.34 - 1731.78] this is a perfect chance to put medicine
[1727.66 - 1734.84] in your food because
[1731.78 - 1739.88] the fat hides
[1734.84 - 1743.24] the flavor of really intense herb
[1739.88 - 1744.98] amounts like when you're using Rosemary
[1743.24 - 1747.56] in thyme so let's go over this a little
[1744.98 - 1749.36] bit so I got some thyme right here
[1747.56 - 1750.98] it's out of the garden I got some
[1749.36 - 1752.72] Rosemary out of the garden too let's
[1750.98 - 1754.76] cover this this is medicine right here
[1752.72 - 1758.54] this herb it's incredible
[1754.76 - 1760.88] now here's what I do now I cut these for
[1758.54 - 1762.32] the show so I I took this off my
[1760.88 - 1764.96] rosemary plant and I cut these for the
[1762.32 - 1768.86] show right but I don't do that I don't
[1764.96 - 1771.50] cut my rosemary plant ever I strip my
[1768.86 - 1773.30] rosemary plant so here's how I do it is
[1771.50 - 1776.48] say this rosemary plant is still here
[1773.30 - 1778.94] and like and I'm outside right now and
[1776.48 - 1782.24] I'm going up to my rosemary plant
[1778.94 - 1784.82] for this show I said well I'm gonna cut
[1782.24 - 1786.32] these so let me go and cut these for
[1784.82 - 1789.14] everybody for this joke because I want
[1786.32 - 1791.72] to show them this all right okay here we
[1789.14 - 1793.76] go I cut these this is for the show now
[1791.72 - 1796.34] I don't do that
[1793.76 - 1798.80] this is what I do even though I had to
[1796.34 - 1801.26] do for Joe this is what I do instead of
[1798.80 - 1804.80] cutting them I take my hand
[1801.26 - 1806.84] and I pull the leaves off but I leave
[1804.80 - 1808.34] the stems so let's do that now so just
[1806.84 - 1809.36] pretend this is just sitting out there
[1808.34 - 1812.60] right
[1809.36 - 1815.90] okay I'm outside now right
[1812.60 - 1818.84] that's what I do did you see that
[1815.90 - 1823.04] so when I'm making my food at home
[1818.84 - 1825.56] I leave that stem like that on the plant
[1823.04 - 1827.06] and then I have all the Rosemary in my
[1825.56 - 1829.94] hand I'll show you a close-up real quick
[1827.06 - 1833.90] now the reason why I do this is because
[1829.94 - 1836.96] the leaves will grow back on this stem
[1833.90 - 1839.36] faster than if you cut the whole stem
[1836.96 - 1841.10] and now you're kind of just basically
[1839.36 - 1842.54] cutting down and cutting back your
[1841.10 - 1843.80] rosemary plant and then you're not going
[1842.54 - 1845.06] to be able to use it all the time
[1843.80 - 1846.50] because it's going to need to grow and
[1845.06 - 1848.54] it could take a long time
[1846.50 - 1850.16] so what I like doing is stripping the
[1848.54 - 1851.90] plant down so it's something I want to
[1850.16 - 1853.40] show you guys right there that I thought
[1851.90 - 1855.32] was important
[1853.40 - 1856.82] uh you know piece of important
[1855.32 - 1859.40] information there
[1856.82 - 1862.88] Marianne says aw please tell our friends
[1859.40 - 1866.06] why they should wash them first avocados
[1862.88 - 1867.50] why bother washing the avocado you can
[1866.06 - 1869.48] get all the
[1867.50 - 1870.98] germs you want
[1869.48 - 1873.92] that's sitting there in the grocery
[1870.98 - 1876.32] store and everybody's walking by and
[1873.92 - 1878.30] they're all walking by and they're like
[1876.32 - 1881.54] who cares they just came out of the
[1878.30 - 1883.40] bathroom and he just wiped their butt
[1881.54 - 1885.98] um do you know how they wipe their butt
[1883.40 - 1888.32] do you know how people wipe their butt
[1885.98 - 1890.48] are they good at it
[1888.32 - 1893.42] right because
[1890.48 - 1895.04] last I've known all these years people
[1893.42 - 1896.60] who wipe their butt with the toilet
[1895.04 - 1898.28] paper still get everything from their
[1896.60 - 1900.26] butt all over their hands
[1898.28 - 1903.62] they're not careful
[1900.26 - 1905.78] so everybody just going to the store and
[1903.62 - 1908.68] grabbing everything yeah and whatnot of
[1905.78 - 1908.68] course that's just one thing
[1910.34 - 1913.58] oh
[1911.84 - 1917.18] oh
[1913.58 - 1918.44] lots of sneezing going on my God but
[1917.18 - 1919.94] that's okay
[1918.44 - 1921.80] you know it doesn't matter if anybody
[1919.94 - 1923.90] sneezes on your avocados in the store
[1921.80 - 1926.48] either who cares right
[1923.90 - 1929.18] don't wash them right it doesn't matter
[1926.48 - 1931.52] oh the carriage oh there's only a
[1929.18 - 1934.22] hundred varieties of streptococcus on a
[1931.52 - 1935.90] carriage handle but that's okay is
[1934.22 - 1937.70] everybody pushing their Carriage to the
[1935.90 - 1939.86] store they can just touch the avocados
[1937.70 - 1942.86] and kind of look for one I'm looking for
[1939.86 - 1945.08] one right here oops I Spit on them uh oh
[1942.86 - 1947.30] I was talking to someone and spit flung
[1945.08 - 1949.16] out of my mouth on the avocados but
[1947.30 - 1951.50] don't wash them because you don't need
[1949.16 - 1953.24] to wash them just just take them home
[1951.50 - 1955.22] from the store and just cut right in
[1953.24 - 1956.84] there and make sure your kids and you
[1955.22 - 1959.48] and everybody is just eating and
[1956.84 - 1961.28] whatever no big deal that's why it's
[1959.48 - 1962.84] important to wash them and that's just a
[1961.28 - 1964.94] couple of reasons there's a lot more
[1962.84 - 1968.18] reasons right
[1964.94 - 1970.70] so what I'm doing here right so I'm just
[1968.18 - 1973.70] kind of mashing these lightly at first I
[1970.70 - 1974.84] don't want to puree these right
[1973.70 - 1977.30] okay
[1974.84 - 1980.12] and the other thing is the knife
[1977.30 - 1982.34] will shove the germs in
[1980.12 - 1985.04] so if you don't wash the outside in the
[1982.34 - 1986.90] skin the knife is going to drive all the
[1985.04 - 1988.58] germs in well that's right there's no
[1986.90 - 1990.80] such thing as germs like people think
[1988.58 - 1992.06] okay that's why everybody just went
[1990.80 - 1994.10] through hell and back for the last
[1992.06 - 1997.28] couple years and chronic illness is at
[1994.10 - 1999.32] its worst anyway no there's no germs of
[1997.28 - 2001.00] course not don't have to worry about no
[1999.32 - 2003.04] bugs
[2001.00 - 2005.56] suit it makes you stronger to get germs
[2003.04 - 2007.84] oh it does oh sure
[2005.56 - 2009.94] Susan Janet says I saw someone remove
[2007.84 - 2012.06] their mask in the produce section so
[2009.94 - 2016.08] they could pick their nose
[2012.06 - 2020.50] really and I bet you that one person
[2016.08 - 2025.36] that did that probably put the booger on
[2020.50 - 2026.86] that produce at the same time so
[2025.36 - 2028.60] all right

[2154.84 - 2160.54] and but you still don't want to puree it
[2158.50 - 2161.98] so let's move the guacamole over a
[2160.54 - 2165.40] little bit
[2161.98 - 2166.48] okay let's chop up some herbs let's do
[2165.40 - 2170.08] that now
[2166.48 - 2173.80] so I got some Rosemary right here
[2170.08 - 2175.24] now this is a medicinal guacamole and
[2173.80 - 2178.12] what you're looking at is a lot of
[2175.24 - 2180.46] Rosemary it's the way I do it you don't
[2178.12 - 2181.96] have to do it the way I do it you can do
[2180.46 - 2185.02] it any way you want I'm going to strip
[2181.96 - 2186.82] off more of this okay
[2185.02 - 2188.38] see how much Rosemary's there look at
[2186.82 - 2190.96] that I might even do a little bit more
[2188.38 - 2192.70] check that out you guys that's the way I
[2190.96 - 2196.54] do it
[2192.70 - 2199.78] now this is very Rosemary e for real
[2196.54 - 2203.32] okay like this is really serious like
[2199.78 - 2205.48] amounts compared to that rosemary plant
[2203.32 - 2207.28] that sits on the salmon at the
[2205.48 - 2208.54] restaurant you know the rosemary plant
[2207.28 - 2210.28] that sits on the salmon in the
[2208.54 - 2212.74] restaurant little piece of rosemary
[2210.28 - 2215.76] plant you just move it over this is like
[2212.74 - 2215.76] a lot of Rosemary
[2215.86 - 2222.76] and I chop it really fine is what I do
[2219.28 - 2224.68] okay that's how I like it
[2222.76 - 2227.76] so I get it to a point where then I'll
[2224.68 - 2227.76] chop it a little bit more too
[2228.52 - 2232.56] just get it nice and good
[2233.08 - 2235.68] there you go
[2237.22 - 2242.08] so that's the Rosemary part I'm gonna
[2239.68 - 2245.16] scoop it into my hand
[2242.08 - 2245.16] and into the bowl
[2245.32 - 2249.82] sprinkle it right on top
[2247.66 - 2252.22] see how much went in there now you may
[2249.82 - 2254.98] not like the taste of this so do less
[2252.22 - 2256.54] how about just baby stepping I don't
[2254.98 - 2260.28] have to do a lot of that let's get some
[2256.54 - 2260.28] more herbs here whoa
[2260.68 - 2264.46] what's this right so I took this out of
[2263.62 - 2267.88] the garden
[2264.46 - 2270.34] that's lemon balm okay now I like doing
[2267.88 - 2273.34] a little bit of lemon balm in the
[2270.34 - 2276.82] guacamole make it real medicinal the
[2273.34 - 2280.36] herbs make it medicinal avocado itself
[2276.82 - 2282.28] on its own it's not medicinal enough to
[2280.36 - 2284.26] take care of what we're up against right
[2282.28 - 2285.76] now in the world of Health meaning the
[2284.26 - 2288.10] problems people are up against the
[2285.76 - 2290.32] pathogens the metals everything else
[2288.10 - 2293.56] that's wrong with them it's not enough
[2290.32 - 2296.68] to just eat an avocado as as beautiful
[2293.56 - 2299.44] and pure and naturistic that avocado is
[2296.68 - 2302.62] it's still got the fat in there and
[2299.44 - 2304.48] that's okay it's a better fat but if
[2302.62 - 2306.82] we're gonna eat that avocado and eat
[2304.48 - 2310.30] that fat let's make it medicine because
[2306.82 - 2312.82] we need things so we can fight sickness
[2310.30 - 2313.96] and illness here's a little bit of lemon
[2312.82 - 2316.00] balm
[2313.96 - 2318.04] chopping up a little bit of lemon balm
[2316.00 - 2320.80] real quick that's gonna go in the
[2318.04 - 2322.66] guacamole Michelle L trolls also getting
[2320.80 - 2323.98] sneakier out there with their tactics oh
[2322.66 - 2326.80] you wouldn't believe the things they
[2323.98 - 2328.48] said they act like they're an mmm
[2326.80 - 2331.42] they're an mm follower they act like
[2328.48 - 2334.00] they've been like a fan I I got all your
[2331.42 - 2336.22] books but you're the worst person in the
[2334.00 - 2338.80] world that's what they do
[2336.22 - 2341.86] yeah um I want everybody to read this
[2338.80 - 2344.86] one star I got all your books I used to
[2341.86 - 2347.86] like UAW but then you're really the
[2344.86 - 2351.00] worst person in the world so yeah and I
[2347.86 - 2351.00] don't like the way you speak
[2351.58 - 2356.02] all right so I'm chopping up some lemon
[2353.20 - 2358.24] ball Michelle L used it as a vehicle for
[2356.02 - 2361.60] herbs you're using the avocado as a
[2358.24 - 2365.86] vehicle for herbs right so you guys
[2361.60 - 2368.32] that's lemon balm right there going in
[2365.86 - 2370.54] that the lemon balm going in
[2368.32 - 2372.64] Kathy Kirby so should I not worry about
[2370.54 - 2374.86] eating avocado while cleansing all
[2372.64 - 2378.76] depends on what's Happening Reed cleanse
[2374.86 - 2382.18] the heel if you can make sure you get a
[2378.76 - 2384.88] brain saver book too so make sure that's
[2382.18 - 2386.98] happening right in the future if you can
[2384.88 - 2391.18] that's these these books are incredible
[2386.98 - 2392.98] listen to the podcast listen to the I
[2391.18 - 2395.86] explain in the podcast episode actually

[2395.86 - 2399.36] meeting podcast
[2397.72 - 2403.66] all right so check this out you guys
[2399.36 - 2407.56] these are garlic chives right here
[2403.66 - 2409.54] so garlic chives it's not a chive but
[2407.56 - 2412.18] it's a garlic chive right it's got a
[2409.54 - 2415.66] different flavor it's got a garlicky
[2412.18 - 2418.00] flavor but it's really medicinal so
[2415.66 - 2420.42] we're gonna put some garlic chives in
[2418.00 - 2420.42] here right
[2421.66 - 2427.00] you're making a medicine with your
[2424.42 - 2430.30] guacamole when you do this okay
[2427.00 - 2431.92] so on Facebook Karen Ryden says my

[2461.74 - 2465.52] stuff that's incredible she's using

[2474.94 - 2477.54] going to be doing
[2478.36 - 2483.64] some oregano so I got some oregano here
[2481.00 - 2486.28] Oregano's got a strong flavor but when
[2483.64 - 2490.24] you're using avocado
[2486.28 - 2493.06] to mask the flavor intense flavors of
[2490.24 - 2496.12] these herbs you're using it
[2493.06 - 2498.64] right as a vehicle like Michelle said
[2496.12 - 2501.76] that's what you're doing so I'm doing
[2498.64 - 2503.98] some now oregano now this guacamole is
[2501.76 - 2506.38] getting really medicinal
[2503.98 - 2509.20] that might have been a a weed right
[2506.38 - 2511.80] there from the garden
[2509.20 - 2511.80] so
[2511.96 - 2517.56] all right there we go got some oregano
[2514.24 - 2517.56] now so let's chop up that
[2520.18 - 2524.92] all right so now we have Rosemary in
[2522.76 - 2527.94] there we have oregano in there garlic
[2524.92 - 2527.94] chives in there
[2528.70 - 2531.64] we're also going to put some scallions

[2531.64 - 2536.38] so we're gonna have that too
[2534.22 - 2539.02] now you can chop them up as fine as you
[2536.38 - 2541.92] want I like it just fine enough
[2539.02 - 2541.92] here we go
[2543.52 - 2547.48] perfect
[2545.02 - 2548.86] for me it's the way I like it
[2547.48 - 2551.20] so let me just give you a little window
[2548.86 - 2552.58] in this here's the guacamole coming
[2551.20 - 2554.50] together
[2552.58 - 2557.74] so far you're looking at a lot of herbs
[2554.50 - 2560.56] in there you're looking at the medicine
[2557.74 - 2562.90] it's the Rosemary chopped up it's the
[2560.56 - 2565.30] oregano chopped up it's the garlic
[2562.90 - 2566.62] chives chopped up right there it's the
[2565.30 - 2569.14] lemon balm there's a little bit of lemon
[2566.62 - 2571.96] balm in there let's keep on going
[2569.14 - 2575.38] because we got some work to do Sage

[2616.90 - 2619.96] going you guys let's get a little bit of
[2618.34 - 2621.94] time now this time
[2619.96 - 2624.28] I dried out a little bit
[2621.94 - 2625.72] right here so I dried this out a little
[2624.28 - 2628.00] bit so what I'm doing is I'm kind of
[2625.72 - 2630.46] just taking it right off
[2628.00 - 2631.66] the stems don't even need to really chop
[2630.46 - 2634.24] this
[2631.66 - 2636.84] it's dry it's nice and fine I'll give it
[2634.24 - 2636.84] a light chop
[2638.14 - 2643.38] here it is you got your time right you
[2640.96 - 2646.24] guys know how I think about time
[2643.38 - 2647.80] you guys know I love it putting that in
[2646.24 - 2650.20] the guacamole let's keep on going
[2647.80 - 2652.54] scallions
[2650.20 - 2654.40] right oh we got some right here look at
[2652.54 - 2655.48] this I always Cut Off The Roots I want
[2654.40 - 2658.66] to show you guys
[2655.48 - 2660.16] here's what I do Cut Off The Roots
[2658.66 - 2662.38] I didn't have to cut that I could have
[2660.16 - 2664.90] cut back even better than that but I was
[2662.38 - 2667.48] doing that pretty quick right so
[2664.90 - 2669.34] I like scallions inside
[2667.48 - 2671.32] my guacamole
[2669.34 - 2674.32] flavors it nicely
[2671.32 - 2676.00] hides well as well as you know like if
[2674.32 - 2678.82] you're somebody that's really you don't
[2676.00 - 2681.34] like that onion flavor
[2678.82 - 2684.28] gives it texture too so that's what's
[2681.34 - 2686.86] incredible about the scallions gives the
[2684.28 - 2689.20] guacamole texture
[2686.86 - 2692.50] something in there right
[2689.20 - 2694.30] I like my guacamole nice and
[2692.50 - 2696.88] like I want things in there right
[2694.30 - 2698.64] incredible any particular Sage you can
[2696.88 - 2701.20] use the one that you like best for sure
[2698.64 - 2702.94] so let's move on we've got some
[2701.20 - 2704.88] scallions in there okay here's one
[2702.94 - 2709.12] that's interesting
[2704.88 - 2711.06] mustard greens you guys mustard greens
[2709.12 - 2714.88] now
[2711.06 - 2716.32] the World of Food Science
[2714.88 - 2718.90] right
[2716.32 - 2721.00] believes it's just a green
[2718.90 - 2723.82] mustard greens
[2721.00 - 2726.46] but mustard greens should be classified
[2723.82 - 2728.80] as an herb
[2726.46 - 2731.20] it's a mistake it's not classified
[2728.80 - 2734.32] correctly out there people don't know
[2731.20 - 2738.76] that that is an herb and it should be
[2734.32 - 2741.04] classified as such very medicinal very
[2738.76 - 2743.98] spicy very strong but really really
[2741.04 - 2745.12] medicinal I put mustard greens that came
[2743.98 - 2747.34] out of the garden because I'm growing
[2745.12 - 2749.86] some mustard greens right now
[2747.34 - 2751.66] now mustard greens are really too sharp
[2749.86 - 2753.76] for a lot of people they can't eat them
[2751.66 - 2756.04] because they're too sharp they're like
[2753.76 - 2759.16] oh my God that was like horseradish in
[2756.04 - 2761.62] the worst way it was so sharp okay now I
[2759.16 - 2763.72] don't cut this up that fine mustard
[2761.62 - 2766.12] greens I like because it's a soft green
[2763.72 - 2768.34] I like it to go in just like that but
[2766.12 - 2769.60] what you guys have to know
[2768.34 - 2772.48] is that
[2769.60 - 2775.84] that's an herb you're putting in very
[2772.48 - 2779.98] sharp but the fat hides it
[2775.84 - 2781.90] so you'll see here look how herb that is
[2779.98 - 2784.18] like that's herbed out
[2781.90 - 2788.14] there's no weed in there
[2784.18 - 2790.18] no weed man so it is just straight
[2788.14 - 2791.86] herb right good herb so let's keep on
[2790.18 - 2794.32] moving
[2791.86 - 2796.48] let's go with I think we got to do our
[2794.32 - 2800.20] peppers in there some hot peppers
[2796.48 - 2803.86] let's get a Cayenne
[2800.20 - 2805.66] in that guacamole right now listen you
[2803.86 - 2808.24] can make it the way you want to make it
[2805.66 - 2809.32] you can just get some ideas here what
[2808.24 - 2811.00] about that
[2809.32 - 2814.42] you guys check out the medical meme
[2811.00 - 2816.64] podcast at Apple podcast avocado are you
[2814.42 - 2819.40] avocado toast
[2816.64 - 2821.56] check out the episode I talk all about
[2819.40 - 2823.78] the avocado stuff that's really
[2821.56 - 2826.00] important to know
[2823.78 - 2828.16] it's a great episode really proud of it
[2826.00 - 2830.44] now that's a cayenne pepper here's a
[2828.16 - 2831.70] jalapeno right there that can go in
[2830.44 - 2834.88] there too
[2831.70 - 2837.82] it's a red jalapeno happens to be much
[2834.88 - 2839.98] hotter than a green when you let them go
[2837.82 - 2842.14] red like that that's out of the garden I
[2839.98 - 2844.36] like to grow peppers um you know I
[2842.14 - 2846.52] definitely love growing peppers right
[2844.36 - 2848.02] that's a sweet pepper right there and
[2846.52 - 2849.34] it's not a bell pepper like this but
[2848.02 - 2850.78] it's a sweet pepper I'll show you guys
[2849.34 - 2853.42] if you want to see
[2850.78 - 2856.36] and so this is
[2853.42 - 2858.58] um these are obviously sweeter milder
[2856.36 - 2860.92] this got a little bit of spice to it
[2858.58 - 2862.24] right so you can cut the back off like
[2860.92 - 2865.00] that
[2862.24 - 2868.38] take the stem out
[2865.00 - 2868.38] okay and then
[2868.54 - 2872.44] so I like to cut this
[2870.70 - 2875.68] pretty small
[2872.44 - 2877.96] I even like the Rind up inside of it
[2875.68 - 2881.10] right the pith
[2877.96 - 2881.10] the pulp inside of it
[2881.26 - 2885.04] I don't want to mince this until it's
[2883.78 - 2887.80] too small
[2885.04 - 2891.54] I like something to bite onto with this
[2887.80 - 2891.54] guacamole this medicinal guacamole
[2892.96 - 2898.12] and I'm gonna get that pepper in
[2896.50 - 2899.92] all right
[2898.12 - 2901.24] incredible
[2899.92 - 2903.16] all right so let's think about other
[2901.24 - 2905.74] stuff we need to put into that we have
[2903.16 - 2908.50] here so I think we cover the herbs which
[2905.74 - 2909.94] is really awesome so we got that now
[2908.50 - 2912.72] let's get some
[2909.94 - 2912.72] lemon
[2913.00 - 2918.10] in here actually I'm gonna cut an onion
[2915.64 - 2919.72] so looking like I don't know what I'm
[2918.10 - 2922.66] doing for a second but I'm looking for
[2919.72 - 2924.82] an onion right one here so with this
[2922.66 - 2927.28] onion this is a red onion they're
[2924.82 - 2929.76] usually bitier they're usually hotter
[2927.28 - 2929.76] right
[2930.76 - 2936.10] it's not a sweet onion sometimes there's
[2934.12 - 2938.44] some yellow onions that are just brutal
[2936.10 - 2941.20] right you guys I like to peel back the
[2938.44 - 2943.06] spit the skin and I'll tell you why too
[2941.20 - 2945.04] it's not that you can't eat those it's
[2943.06 - 2947.80] just that they're so chewy They Don't
[2945.04 - 2950.74] Really break down right like the skin
[2947.80 - 2952.66] I know people like to punish me a lot of
[2950.74 - 2955.00] people love that they love the punish aw
[2952.66 - 2958.00] and be like the Skins were the best
[2955.00 - 2959.08] stuff is hey W takes the skin off he
[2958.00 - 2962.02] doesn't know what he's talking about
[2959.08 - 2964.78] that proves it it's not gonna follow him
[2962.02 - 2967.36] anymore he didn't know about this one
[2964.78 - 2969.04] this one person says you gotta have the
[2967.36 - 2970.78] skin
[2969.04 - 2973.42] right
[2970.78 - 2976.48] but I like taking the skin off because
[2973.42 - 2977.62] the skin on the onions could be hiding
[2976.48 - 2980.20] something
[2977.62 - 2981.82] from the market like people like when
[2980.20 - 2984.04] they're grabbing their onions and
[2981.82 - 2985.72] they're you know or you know stocking
[2984.04 - 2987.70] them and they got like bacteria and
[2985.72 - 2991.00] other things on their hands and the the
[2987.70 - 2994.30] pathogens could get up under the skin so
[2991.00 - 2996.58] I like to kind of take a layer off right
[2994.30 - 2998.26] now I'm going to put a little bit of
[2996.58 - 3000.96] this red onion in there that's that's
[2998.26 - 3004.88] what I like to do okay
[3000.96 - 3004.88] like to put a little bit of red onion in
[3005.22 - 3008.22] don't want it too thick don't want it
[3007.32 - 3011.28] too thin
[3008.22 - 3014.28] I'm gonna chop that up
[3011.28 - 3017.30] flip it around for a second okay
[3014.28 - 3017.30] that's going in
[3017.94 - 3022.08] listen if you don't like onion if it's
[3019.68 - 3024.36] too sharp for you you don't have to put
[3022.08 - 3027.66] it in your guacamole you can put just
[3024.36 - 3030.54] Rosemary and Sage you guys but I'm
[3027.66 - 3032.46] making a really really medicinal one so
[3030.54 - 3034.80] let's get the Lemon Let's get the lime
[3032.46 - 3036.96] going right so we got some lemons right
[3034.80 - 3039.20] there
[3036.96 - 3039.20] foreign
[3042.98 - 3046.88] which is incredible is
[3048.60 - 3053.46] you can put lime in your guacamole now I
[3050.88 - 3055.20] don't put a lot of lemon in my guacamole
[3053.46 - 3058.56] I'm only putting a little bit of lemon
[3055.20 - 3059.70] by the way lemon is medicine too it's
[3058.56 - 3061.44] medicinal
[3059.70 - 3064.02] for sure okay
[3061.44 - 3067.20] I'm not putting a lot of lemon in I
[3064.02 - 3070.20] don't want my guacamole watery
[3067.20 - 3072.24] don't want it too too wet and watery
[3070.20 - 3076.16] that's number one right
[3072.24 - 3076.16] okay now check this out though
[3076.44 - 3082.50] right
[3078.90 - 3086.28] okay lime brings out avocado flavor like
[3082.50 - 3089.76] nothing else does it has a reaction
[3086.28 - 3091.80] with the sugar in avocado so lime has a
[3089.76 - 3094.26] reaction with the sugar and the fat and
[3091.80 - 3098.22] avocado so I love lime I like putting a
[3094.26 - 3100.38] lot of lime in my guacamole
[3098.22 - 3103.74] it's one of one of my favorite things to
[3100.38 - 3105.00] do the flavor does it compare I feel
[3103.74 - 3106.74] personally
[3105.00 - 3108.84] you guys just came on here we're talking
[3106.74 - 3111.24] about the avocado episode you can
[3108.84 - 3114.36] obviously see I'm just a little pumped
[3111.24 - 3117.06] up about that episode released it last
[3114.36 - 3119.40] night I hope you guys heard it link is
[3117.06 - 3121.38] in the description right
[3119.40 - 3122.70] I'm gonna do one more lime so I'm gonna
[3121.38 - 3124.74] go with two limes with this with
[3122.70 - 3126.54] everything I got in here
[3124.74 - 3129.18] someone yelled at me the other day and
[3126.54 - 3131.76] said stop throwing fruit around
[3129.18 - 3133.62] stop tossing fruit in the air
[3131.76 - 3135.42] but I've been doing it you know my whole
[3133.62 - 3137.04] life a lot of times the fruit might end
[3135.42 - 3139.38] up on the floor something might hit
[3137.04 - 3141.42] something I was over a friend's house a
[3139.38 - 3142.56] couple years ago and I threw a piece of
[3141.42 - 3146.04] fruit in the air
[3142.56 - 3147.42] and it knocked over his wine glass which
[3146.04 - 3149.82] I thought was funny because I wasn't
[3147.42 - 3152.40] drinking wine
[3149.82 - 3154.50] and the wine glass knocked over and the
[3152.40 - 3157.20] wine went on his carpet
[3154.50 - 3160.14] and it was a white carpet
[3157.20 - 3162.54] so let's talk about salt that's the next
[3160.14 - 3163.74] thing right now if you guys got a second
[3162.54 - 3166.32] okay
[3163.74 - 3168.00] I feel like that's perfect amount of
[3166.32 - 3169.98] lime for the moment
[3168.00 - 3172.74] now
[3169.98 - 3175.86] everybody loves salt in their guacamole
[3172.74 - 3177.12] right or pepper salt and pepper they
[3175.86 - 3179.52] love salt
[3177.12 - 3181.02] here's why I don't use salt in my
[3179.52 - 3183.30] guacamole first of all I'm not a big
[3181.02 - 3184.62] salt fan because you don't want too much
[3183.30 - 3187.32] salt
[3184.62 - 3189.54] in your diet because it ends up building
[3187.32 - 3191.64] up it ends up building up in your liver
[3189.54 - 3193.20] it can build up in your brain I talk
[3191.64 - 3194.52] about that in the brain books you got to
[3193.20 - 3197.34] check it out when you get get a chance
[3194.52 - 3200.16] and check these brain books out
[3197.34 - 3202.68] but the reason why I don't like salt in
[3200.16 - 3205.02] guacamole is it sweats it
[3202.68 - 3207.78] I don't want everything sweating because
[3205.02 - 3210.78] what salt does in here is it sweats the
[3207.78 - 3214.50] onion it sweats the pepper it sweats the
[3210.78 - 3217.50] avocado so it starts to disfigure it it
[3214.50 - 3219.36] starts to pull moisture out of it in the
[3217.50 - 3221.46] wrong way you don't want to do that and
[3219.36 - 3224.28] then it turns into kind of like a sweaty
[3221.46 - 3227.76] slob so I don't like putting salt in the
[3224.28 - 3230.28] guacamole I like to use lime as that
[3227.76 - 3231.60] salt and then I like to use a celery
[3230.28 - 3233.64] stick
[3231.60 - 3236.76] as
[3233.64 - 3238.50] a tool because it's a salty tool but the
[3236.76 - 3240.24] right kind of salt right the good stuff
[3238.50 - 3242.58] so
[3240.24 - 3245.22] you guys know like I've written books
[3242.58 - 3247.56] books about the the sodium that sits
[3245.22 - 3249.60] inside celery right
[3247.56 - 3251.40] sodium cluster salt it's a different
[3249.60 - 3253.20] flavor it's a whole different kind of
[3251.40 - 3254.46] composition
[3253.20 - 3257.46] so
[3254.46 - 3259.98] I don't like to I like it kind of a
[3257.46 - 3262.20] hunkier guacamole for me you guys might
[3259.98 - 3264.54] like it as a creamy puree
[3262.20 - 3266.82] not a big fan of it that way but I don't
[3264.54 - 3269.10] want pole halves in here so I'm just
[3266.82 - 3271.50] kind of mashing up
[3269.10 - 3273.78] the whole halves right kind of breaking
[3271.50 - 3275.88] them up a little bit there we go
[3273.78 - 3278.04] so that when you stick a cracker in
[3275.88 - 3279.78] there if you have guests or something or
[3278.04 - 3281.40] you stick something in there a chip
[3279.78 - 3283.50] because you know someone might like some
[3281.40 - 3286.94] chips that you're not getting like stuck
[3283.50 - 3286.94] on a whole half of avocado
[3288.12 - 3291.74] right now mixing this up
[3295.92 - 3299.22] there we go
[3297.18 - 3301.08] now you can put tomato on top you can
[3299.22 - 3302.64] put tomato on the side you can do
[3301.08 - 3305.76] anything like that
[3302.64 - 3307.32] let me chop up a couple of tools one
[3305.76 - 3309.24] tool I like to use which I'll show you
[3307.32 - 3311.10] right here to actually scoop my
[3309.24 - 3313.38] guacamole I'll show you in a minute so
[3311.10 - 3316.58] let me start making
[3313.38 - 3316.58] um a couple tools here
[3316.92 - 3323.10] so here's one tool I use which people
[3320.94 - 3325.38] think I'm crazy
[3323.10 - 3327.36] but I put guacamole right on a whole
[3325.38 - 3329.58] half of onion like that now I know that
[3327.36 - 3331.74] like probably doesn't seem right and
[3329.58 - 3335.04] someone's got probably something to say
[3331.74 - 3336.48] about that I'm sure like but yeah like
[3335.04 - 3338.82] you know meaning like because it looks
[3336.48 - 3340.62] kind of like so intense sometimes we're
[3338.82 - 3342.96] like oh my God how does he do that like
[3340.62 - 3345.06] so I take like pieces of onion that are
[3342.96 - 3347.22] big pieces like this and I like to use
[3345.06 - 3350.82] that let me chop up some bell pepper
[3347.22 - 3353.78] that's a great tool to pick guacamole on
[3350.82 - 3353.78] right there
[3355.56 - 3359.34] so
[3357.66 - 3362.28] what you can do is you can make some
[3359.34 - 3364.20] some bell pepper slices right here
[3362.28 - 3365.76] so I'm just going to prepare these make
[3364.20 - 3368.42] a little crudite you can have it with
[3365.76 - 3368.42] your guacamole
[3369.00 - 3375.08] right got some bell pepper
[3371.76 - 3375.08] that's amazing that'll go in
[3376.14 - 3381.26] and celery sticks is another great thing
[3378.48 - 3381.26] all on its own
[3382.62 - 3387.66] guys if you just got here we're making a
[3385.74 - 3392.66] medicinal guacamole we actually already
[3387.66 - 3395.90] made it okay so I got a cucumber
[3392.66 - 3395.90] right here
[3396.78 - 3401.34] now you can peel the Cucumber if you
[3399.24 - 3403.26] want I wash this cucumber really good
[3401.34 - 3407.06] but the thing about cucumbers though
[3403.26 - 3410.76] organic produce does have they still use
[3407.06 - 3412.82] a coating on the outside of a lot of
[3410.76 - 3412.82] um
[3413.76 - 3417.90] a lot of them so let me just see if I
[3416.34 - 3419.82] can just kind of take down the skin a
[3417.90 - 3422.94] little bit
[3419.82 - 3427.04] real quick for you guys there we go
[3422.94 - 3427.04] not going to take it completely off but
[3429.06 - 3432.20] take some of it off
[3435.60 - 3441.06] there you go amazing
[3439.08 - 3444.20] I don't like using the skin of a
[3441.06 - 3444.20] cucumber personally
[3446.10 - 3450.54] unless it came out of the garden big
[3448.44 - 3452.10] difference right there unless it came
[3450.54 - 3454.32] out of the garden and that's another
[3452.10 - 3457.08] story right there okay so I'm gonna do
[3454.32 - 3458.94] is do some cucumber slices I like to do
[3457.08 - 3461.18] that as an option
[3458.94 - 3461.18] foreign
[3464.36 - 3468.60] sticks that's another way to do it right
[3466.62 - 3472.70] so I'll do two kinds
[3468.60 - 3472.70] get this ready for you guys
[3474.30 - 3479.42] and then I'm gonna actually cut the
[3476.28 - 3479.42] sticks right here like that
[3482.76 - 3484.76] okay
[3487.76 - 3492.72] and get some of them like that
[3490.38 - 3496.68] it's an option
[3492.72 - 3499.26] all right got some onion pieces here
[3496.68 - 3503.24] this is just like a quick rendition of
[3499.26 - 3503.24] it like but you can go with this
[3505.44 - 3511.64] why is the phone ringing
[3508.14 - 3511.64] who's calling me right now
[3511.86 - 3515.48] don't they know I'm doing this
[3515.52 - 3519.50] so there we go you guys
[3519.78 - 3524.46] cutting some celery sticks right now
[3521.58 - 3526.70] which is really awesome
[3524.46 - 3526.70] foreign
[3528.32 - 3532.88] got that covered boom
[3535.44 - 3538.16] nice
[3540.06 - 3544.38] and of course
[3542.34 - 3547.28] you can do some tomato some tomato
[3544.38 - 3547.28] slices too
[3547.56 - 3553.64] I like to put guacamole on tomato slices
[3550.08 - 3553.64] it's one of my favorite things to do
[3555.96 - 3562.46] we got that as well amazing cucumbers
[3559.68 - 3562.46] tomatoes
[3564.36 - 3569.18] get some of those in here
[3566.52 - 3569.18] all right
[3571.38 - 3575.52] so this is the herb guacamole right here
[3574.20 - 3577.62] I don't know if it's the prettiest
[3575.52 - 3579.84] guacamole but this is what it is I'll
[3577.62 - 3581.34] have you guys take a look okay
[3579.84 - 3584.72] so what I'm going to do is scoop some
[3581.34 - 3584.72] right in this bowl right here
[3586.62 - 3593.34] so this is a medicinal version
[3590.52 - 3595.50] if I'm gonna have guacamole I want to
[3593.34 - 3598.40] know it's medicine right that's that's
[3595.50 - 3598.40] what I want to know
[3599.22 - 3604.20] yes you can eat a plain avocado no
[3601.74 - 3607.64] problem of course you can
[3604.20 - 3607.64] definitely can do that
[3613.38 - 3619.76] all right
[3615.48 - 3619.76] there we go right there you guys
[3621.06 - 3625.50] take a look
[3622.50 - 3627.78] so what you see right here is you see
[3625.50 - 3629.76] this herb medicinal guacamole right in
[3627.78 - 3632.52] the center okay
[3629.76 - 3634.62] and then you see some crackers by the
[3632.52 - 3636.24] way for people who like crackers check
[3634.62 - 3637.74] it out in my directory you guys if you
[3636.24 - 3640.20] want to check out wood cracker that is
[3637.74 - 3642.00] you can find it on my directory there's
[3640.20 - 3644.28] no fat in this cracker at all so there's
[3642.00 - 3645.72] no fat in there at all there's no oils
[3644.28 - 3647.70] there's no vegetable oils there's
[3645.72 - 3649.02] nothing like that in there so that's
[3647.70 - 3651.48] important right there so I'll show you
[3649.02 - 3653.16] the cracker
[3651.48 - 3656.10] so I want to show you this too you guys
[3653.16 - 3658.92] get a close-up right there there it is
[3656.10 - 3661.08] so you got your beautiful red onion
[3658.92 - 3664.38] okay I'm going to turn this around lost
[3661.08 - 3666.30] the lost the pitcher there
[3664.38 - 3667.98] there you go you got everything on you
[3666.30 - 3671.58] got your tomatoes on there
[3667.98 - 3674.12] you got your red bell peppers right
[3671.58 - 3674.12] so
[3674.58 - 3677.76] [Music]
[3679.14 - 3684.08] so I'm gonna grab a tool really quick
[3687.60 - 3691.92] and I'm gonna take a onion
[3690.66 - 3694.14] right here
[3691.92 - 3696.66] now I know this probably is hard for a
[3694.14 - 3698.52] lot of people to do because onion is too
[3696.66 - 3700.92] strong for them but I love it that's one
[3698.52 - 3703.08] way I do it right there I'll do that as
[3700.92 - 3705.54] an option
[3703.08 - 3708.36] right of course you can use cucumber
[3705.54 - 3710.34] slices you can use celery sticks too

[3838.26 - 3842.94] money in the area to fire that waitress

[3987.30 - 3992.22] avocado for saving people's lives I've
[3990.48 - 3994.08] been able to get people
[3992.22 - 3996.60] off of eggs
[3994.08 - 3999.24] so their chronic illness can actually go
[3996.60 - 4002.36] away I use the avocado to get them off
[3999.24 - 4005.72] of eggs I use the avocado to get them
[4002.36 - 4007.58] off of something bad that was holding
[4005.72 - 4010.52] their healing back it is an incredible
