[0.08 - 5.04] we are
[1.76 - 7.92] everybody is different
[5.04 - 9.84] but not like they think
[7.92 - 11.84] everybody is different this is really
[9.84 - 15.20] important to talk about today
[11.84 - 17.20] every single person is different
[15.20 - 21.44] let's talk about why
[17.20 - 21.44] everyone's soul is different
[21.52 - 26.48] if your soul
[23.28 - 30.32] experiences a hardship
[26.48 - 32.08] betrayal someone stabs you in the back
[30.32 - 34.00] someone lets you down somebody breaks
[32.08 - 35.44] your trust
[34.00 - 37.76] something terrible happening in the
[35.44 - 39.28] world right
[37.76 - 40.72] exactly
[39.28 - 42.80] tragedies
[40.72 - 44.52] anything like that
[42.80 - 47.84] if your soul
[44.52 - 47.84] experiences that
[48.00 - 52.88] that's what makes you different
[50.40 - 54.32] than someone else
[52.88 - 56.64] right
[54.32 - 57.68] because your soul is unique to begin
[56.64 - 59.84] with
[57.68 - 61.12] and then the experiences
[59.84 - 63.52] that your soul goes through are
[61.12 - 64.88] different say it's a breakup say it's a
[63.52 - 67.04] relationship
[64.88 - 70.08] right say you were cheated on
[67.04 - 70.96] how many people were cheated on
[70.08 - 73.12] right
[70.96 - 76.24] how many people were betrayed how many
[73.12 - 79.68] people had their trust break
[76.24 - 82.40] trust is a big one that's a big one
[79.68 - 85.36] so many people go through so much with
[82.40 - 87.52] trust and betrayal and hardship and then
[85.36 - 89.04] we get sick
[87.52 - 91.20] we get sick
[89.04 - 92.64] and we don't come out of our sickness we
[91.20 - 94.64] don't come out of those physical
[92.64 - 96.96] symptoms so we got these neurological
[94.64 - 98.64] symptoms and we don't come out of it
[96.96 - 100.72] it's like wait a minute i've been to my
[98.64 - 103.52] second doctor i've been to my third
[100.72 - 105.36] doctor now i've been to my neurologist
[103.52 - 107.12] now i'm going to another doctor and then
[105.36 - 109.60] a pulmonologist and then i'm going to
[107.12 - 111.44] another internist
[109.60 - 114.00] and he's writing out more scripts to see
[111.44 - 115.92] other doctors and rheumatologists i'm
[114.00 - 118.40] going to now
[115.92 - 120.08] and we lose trust we lose trust in
[118.40 - 121.76] everything we lose trust in our body we
[120.08 - 123.44] lose trust in the people around us we
[121.76 - 125.52] lose trust in
[123.44 - 126.88] what's happening in our world we lose
[125.52 - 128.72] trust
[126.88 - 130.24] we thought we were safe and then we're
[128.72 - 133.28] not safe
[130.24 - 134.96] we get let down all the time
[133.28 - 137.28] and then we get hit with anxiety and
[134.96 - 138.48] depression and everybody's anxiety and
[137.28 - 140.80] depression
[138.48 - 143.44] is different
[140.80 - 145.36] is different anxiety depression is
[143.44 - 147.12] connected to the soul not just
[145.36 - 149.68] physically
[147.12 - 151.44] and everybody's physical reason for
[149.68 - 153.28] anxiety depression is different than
[151.44 - 155.76] another person too
[153.28 - 157.04] it makes us all different
[155.76 - 161.52] it does
[157.04 - 163.36] but what isn't different is your heart
[161.52 - 166.08] beats
[163.36 - 168.80] and it has a function
[166.08 - 172.88] and that's where we're the same on the
[168.80 - 175.76] same as you you're the same as me
[172.88 - 179.60] that's when it's not really
[175.76 - 182.32] an individual thing where no no no no
[179.60 - 185.20] your heart is different
[182.32 - 187.92] our hearts are meant to beat and pump
[185.20 - 190.08] blood they're meant to pull blood
[187.92 - 192.08] up through the liver they're meant to
[190.08 - 194.16] have blood travel through the body and
[192.08 - 196.64] pump through the body
[194.16 - 199.84] our hearts are spreading oxygen around
[196.64 - 201.84] through our blood our hearts are working
[199.84 - 203.76] the same they're supposed to work
[201.84 - 205.68] they're same and then all of a sudden
[203.76 - 208.80] someone's heart
[205.68 - 211.68] goes awry and someone's heart goes amiss
[208.80 - 214.72] and somebody's heart has a problem
[211.68 - 216.40] but that's where we're different
[214.72 - 218.08] because there's something that could be
[216.40 - 219.92] different with that person that made
[218.08 - 221.36] their heart not work right that's
[219.92 - 224.48] different than another person where
[221.36 - 227.20] their hearts doing something different
[224.48 - 229.20] but what is the same is the heart
[227.20 - 230.32] function we're supposed to function the
[229.20 - 232.72] same way
[230.32 - 235.36] you know how else we're the same
[232.72 - 237.12] we're the same because of swallowing
[235.36 - 240.16] we're supposed to be able to chew our
[237.12 - 242.80] food and swallow right
[240.16 - 244.32] well that's what we're supposed to do
[242.80 - 247.20] our brain
[244.32 - 248.40] sends a message
[247.20 - 252.40] okay
[248.40 - 255.52] our vagus nerves are getting messages
[252.40 - 256.64] and then we're swallowing
[255.52 - 258.56] right
[256.64 - 260.88] but if something goes wrong inside the
[258.56 - 262.72] brain
[260.88 - 264.56] that's when it gets different that
[262.72 - 268.00] person can't swallow because something's
[264.56 - 270.08] wrong inside the brain
[268.00 - 271.84] yet we're all the same with the
[270.08 - 275.76] functions
[271.84 - 278.96] we're supposed to have two legs
[275.76 - 280.56] and then someone loses a leg
[278.96 - 282.40] that's a dif that's what makes them
[280.56 - 284.96] different but we're supposed to have
[282.40 - 286.72] these bodily functions you're supposed
[284.96 - 289.12] to be able to go to bathroom like
[286.72 - 290.08] everybody else
[289.12 - 292.64] okay
[290.08 - 295.28] our stomach is supposed to hold food
[292.64 - 298.00] every single person's stomach on the
[295.28 - 300.00] planet is supposed to hold food
[298.00 - 302.32] that's what makes us the same
[300.00 - 302.32] right
[302.40 - 307.28] that's what makes us the same our
[304.40 - 309.44] stomach is supposed to hold food we eat
[307.28 - 311.52] our food we're supposed to chew our food
[309.44 - 314.88] but when something goes wrong
[311.52 - 316.40] and neurologically we can't chew anymore
[314.88 - 319.04] or
[316.40 - 320.72] we have gastroparesis
[319.04 - 324.56] because of a problem
[320.72 - 327.20] and that's what makes us different right
[324.56 - 329.20] but we're all supposed to function the
[327.20 - 331.84] same your pancreas does the same thing
[329.20 - 333.36] my pancreas does same thing you guys
[331.84 - 334.96] your heart does the same thing my heart
[333.36 - 336.00] does your liver does the same thing my
[334.96 - 338.48] liver does
[336.00 - 339.68] words we're lit our livers are doing the
[338.48 - 342.96] same thing
[339.68 - 344.72] unless something gets in your liver
[342.96 - 347.36] and impedes it
[344.72 - 350.00] if something impedes your liver
[347.36 - 352.96] that's what changes that's what makes us
[350.00 - 355.04] different
[352.96 - 356.64] our physical functions are all supposed
[355.04 - 357.76] to be the same your liver is not
[356.64 - 360.32] supposed to do something different than
[357.76 - 362.56] my liver no way
[360.32 - 365.44] it's the suppo it's supposed to do the
[362.56 - 366.64] same thing your kidneys are not
[365.44 - 368.32] your kidneys are supposed to do
[366.64 - 370.48] something entirely than my kidneys so
[368.32 - 372.00] entirely different so all of our kidneys
[370.48 - 373.52] are supposed to do something different
[372.00 - 375.04] than everybody else's kidneys that's not
[373.52 - 376.88] how it works your kidneys are supposed
[375.04 - 378.40] to do the same thing
[376.88 - 380.24] someone else's kidneys are supposed to
[378.40 - 381.68] do and every other person on the planet
[380.24 - 383.20] and the billions of people that are on
[381.68 - 385.20] planet earth your kidneys are supposed
[383.20 - 387.04] to function the same they have the same
[385.20 - 388.12] role in the same job
[387.04 - 390.64] there's no
[388.12 - 391.80] individual there's no
[390.64 - 395.84] bio
[391.80 - 395.84] individual with that
[397.04 - 400.64] but then
[398.56 - 402.72] your colon is supposed to work the same
[400.64 - 404.88] as my colon your colon is supposed to
[402.72 - 407.36] work the same as somebody else's colon
[404.88 - 408.56] they're supposed to work the same
[407.36 - 410.00] they are
[408.56 - 411.52] michelle l you're right except many
[410.00 - 413.92] women are different that's so true
[411.52 - 416.96] exactly
[413.92 - 418.88] peristaltic action is supposed to happen
[416.96 - 421.12] for everybody so all the billions of
[418.88 - 423.20] people on planet earth peristaltic
[421.12 - 425.20] action is supposed to be the same it's
[423.20 - 426.88] supposed to work the same
[425.20 - 430.00] okay
[426.88 - 432.24] you eat your food your vagus nerves send
[430.00 - 435.60] a message to your intestinal tract your
[432.24 - 438.40] intestinal tract twists like this and
[435.60 - 439.92] then your food starts moving along
[438.40 - 442.08] because your intestinal tract is
[439.92 - 444.56] twisting it's supposed to do the same
[442.08 - 446.24] thing everybody else does everybody down
[444.56 - 448.00] the street everybody down the block
[446.24 - 451.12] everybody in another state everybody in
[448.00 - 454.16] another country everybody on the planet
[451.12 - 456.16] is supposed to have the same function
[454.16 - 459.28] it's the vagus nerves receiving a
[456.16 - 461.60] message boom via neurons neurons send
[459.28 - 463.44] that message to your vagus nerves boom
[461.60 - 465.36] vagus nerves go into your intestinal
[463.44 - 466.72] tract and all around your colon and it
[465.36 - 469.44] makes it go
[466.72 - 472.08] right right
[469.44 - 473.92] like the sound effects
[472.08 - 476.24] that's what it's supposed to do for
[473.92 - 479.12] everyone you're no different than that
[476.24 - 481.92] person i'm no different than you i'm no
[479.12 - 484.24] different than that other person see
[481.92 - 486.80] it's all the same
[484.24 - 489.84] right there unless
[486.80 - 492.24] something goes wrong
[489.84 - 494.88] unless now you got a bacteria like
[492.24 - 497.92] streptococcus that's inflaming or eating
[494.88 - 499.84] away at your intestinal lining or you've
[497.92 - 502.88] got something that's eating away the e
[499.84 - 505.28] coli that's eating away at your colon
[502.88 - 507.04] lining and now you got diverticulosis
[505.28 - 509.68] and now you've got inflammation now
[507.04 - 512.08] you've got problems or if a virus eats
[509.68 - 513.84] away at the lining of your in your colon
[512.08 - 516.32] and now you've got colitis so it's a
[513.84 - 518.80] shingles virus causing colitis that's
[516.32 - 521.28] what starts making us different that's
[518.80 - 524.48] what is making us different right there
[521.28 - 526.80] your colon is supposed to work
[524.48 - 528.32] exactly umakali
[526.80 - 529.92] i see people saying that we're all
[528.32 - 532.00] different but all of us have the same
[529.92 - 534.16] anatomy and physiology what's different
[532.00 - 536.88] is what we've been exposed to like
[534.16 - 538.96] toxins and bugs
[536.88 - 541.60] exactly 100
[538.96 - 544.00] right that's exactly it
[541.60 - 545.52] so what makes us different
[544.00 - 547.12] is those things you know what else makes
[545.52 - 548.56] this the same
[547.12 - 551.84] blood
[548.56 - 555.60] we all have blood in us
[551.84 - 556.56] and when you take too much blood out
[555.60 - 559.52] like
[556.56 - 561.68] what they did to the lyme community
[559.52 - 563.20] for 40 years
[561.68 - 564.72] i can't tell you how many people who
[563.20 - 565.84] died that didn't need to die from lyme
[564.72 - 567.20] disease
[565.84 - 569.52] because they were bled to death at their
[567.20 - 571.12] doctor's offices let's take another 30
[569.52 - 573.84] vials let's take another 20 miles let's
[571.12 - 576.88] take another 40 vials i can't tell you
[573.84 - 579.20] how many people lost their lives from
[576.88 - 581.76] getting too much blood taken
[579.20 - 583.84] cancer people who had a fighting chance
[581.76 - 585.52] to recover from cancer had the blood
[583.84 - 587.20] drained out of them so they had no more
[585.52 - 590.64] immune system to fight the cancer and
[587.20 - 594.72] then they died earlier
[590.64 - 596.80] lyme disease multiple sclerosis als any
[594.72 - 599.04] any kind of illness really
[596.80 - 601.12] i've seen people with
[599.04 - 602.88] chronic fatigue syndrome die because
[601.12 - 605.60] they were bled to death
[602.88 - 607.28] because we all have blood
[605.60 - 609.92] and here's the difference about the
[607.28 - 611.68] survival of somebody with lyme disease
[609.92 - 613.92] or someone with chronic fatigue syndrome
[611.68 - 615.60] me the difference is how much blood did
[613.92 - 616.96] someone else get taken by their doctors
[615.60 - 619.12] versus somebody else that got blood
[616.96 - 620.48] taken one other doctor took only 12
[619.12 - 621.68] vials from their patient every time they
[620.48 - 624.00] came in which is still bad enough
[621.68 - 626.88] another doctor took 30 vials
[624.00 - 629.04] that patient eventually died
[626.88 - 630.16] that made that situation different but
[629.04 - 633.64] the blood
[630.16 - 633.64] we all have
[634.00 - 638.48] our souls are unique
[636.48 - 641.12] that's for sure
[638.48 - 643.20] no soul is the same
[641.12 - 645.60] no soul is the same but physically our
[643.20 - 648.08] bodies are supposed to function the same
[645.60 - 650.16] the organs function the same your brain
[648.08 - 652.16] is supposed to function the same
[650.16 - 654.24] all these things
[652.16 - 656.08] are supposed to function the same your
[654.24 - 658.48] adrenals are supposed to do the same
[656.08 - 660.00] thing someone else's adrenals do okay
[658.48 - 661.04] you need adrenaline for every single
[660.00 - 662.40] function in your life you need
[661.04 - 664.00] adrenaline when you go to bathroom you
[662.40 - 665.04] need adrenaline when you say hi to
[664.00 - 666.64] somebody
[665.04 - 667.92] do you know that your adrenals actually
[666.64 - 668.88] do a little squirt when you meet
[667.92 - 670.96] somebody
[668.88 - 673.60] do you know that hey how are you hey
[670.96 - 675.20] nice to meet you great to meet you hey
[673.60 - 676.88] how you doing yeah hey great to meet you
[675.20 - 678.08] your adrenals go bam
[676.88 - 680.48] bam
[678.08 - 682.56] just like that every single person who
[680.48 - 684.48] comes across somebody else and says hi
[682.56 - 686.72] to them or meets them in that instant
[684.48 - 690.24] their adrenals go
[686.72 - 691.44] and shoot out a little bit of adrenaline
[690.24 - 693.04] it doesn't matter if you're nervous or
[691.44 - 694.56] not when you're meeting that person
[693.04 - 695.84] that's what happens
[694.56 - 698.00] every single person that goes to their
[695.84 - 699.68] doctor's appointment same thing their
[698.00 - 700.84] adrenals go
[699.68 - 703.36] from white coat
[700.84 - 705.28] syndrome right there
[703.36 - 706.48] right everybody you go to the dentist
[705.28 - 707.68] office and they're about you know you go
[706.48 - 709.04] in the dentist office and they're
[707.68 - 710.72] looking in your mouth and everything
[709.04 - 712.40] your adrenals are starting to go up a
[710.72 - 714.24] little bit
[712.40 - 715.76] you go take a shower your adrenals are
[714.24 - 717.28] going you go to the bathroom it takes
[715.76 - 719.20] adrenaline to go to the bathroom
[717.28 - 720.72] everybody's adrenals do the same thing
[719.20 - 722.24] they all do that they all release
[720.72 - 724.48] adrenaline when we go through all these
[722.24 - 726.64] different experiences right
[724.48 - 729.20] it's how it works
[726.64 - 732.64] now our souls have
[729.20 - 734.56] experiences that come from before this
[732.64 - 736.48] physical body by the way that we don't
[734.56 - 737.76] tap into that we don't we don't connect
[736.48 - 740.32] with
[737.76 - 743.36] but our soul's got experiences from this
[740.32 - 746.16] lifetime too makes us different
[743.36 - 748.32] the soul that we that that we enter this
[746.16 - 749.32] earth with
[748.32 - 752.16] has
[749.32 - 755.60] experiences which make it unique so our
[752.16 - 757.36] souls are so unique they are
[755.60 - 758.72] what makes them really unique it's
[757.36 - 760.96] interesting because you can tell
[758.72 - 762.80] somebody hey
[760.96 - 764.64] if you want to heal this is what you
[762.80 - 767.12] need to do but their soul might be like
[764.64 - 768.56] i don't want to do that
[767.12 - 770.80] i'm going to go do something else so
[768.56 - 773.84] that's their soul is just that's the way
[770.80 - 776.24] their soul is built
[773.84 - 778.32] like souls also help us make decisions
[776.24 - 779.84] they help us make bad decisions too in
[778.32 - 782.32] the world too
[779.84 - 783.84] souls do a lot our soul is different
[782.32 - 786.08] everybody's soul is unique why would you
[783.84 - 788.40] take a right when you could take a left
[786.08 - 790.56] no you should have gone left
[788.40 - 792.80] you know up the mountain instead of
[790.56 - 794.08] right down the hill
[792.80 - 796.16] or you should have done this you should
[794.08 - 797.60] have did the soul just plays a role in
[796.16 - 800.48] so many different decisions we make
[797.60 - 802.24] we're so unique because of that our soul
[800.48 - 804.72] picks our hobbies
[802.24 - 807.44] what we like what we like to do the kind
[804.72 - 808.88] of fun we like to have right some people
[807.44 - 810.48] don't like to sit on the beach and other
[808.88 - 812.24] people love the beach some people like
[810.48 - 815.28] to be on boats some people hate to be on
[812.24 - 816.96] boats that's the soul right there
[815.28 - 818.88] that's the soul some people like to
[816.96 - 822.24] watch a sunset people like to only watch
[818.88 - 824.32] a sunrise some people like to watch both
[822.24 - 825.92] right some people like to drive cars
[824.32 - 828.00] some people like to be passengers in the
[825.92 - 829.44] cars some people like to go out to see a
[828.00 - 831.04] movie some people just want to watch
[829.44 - 832.56] movies at home some people like to have
[831.04 - 834.64] popcorn some people hate popcorn
[832.56 - 838.00] whatever it is the soul does play a role
[834.64 - 839.92] in so many different aspects of our life
[838.00 - 842.00] but our physical body
[839.92 - 845.52] our physical body
[842.00 - 847.12] becomes really different when you get
[845.52 - 849.12] pesticide
[847.12 - 851.60] sprayed on you from your neighbor when
[849.12 - 853.92] you're breathing in scented candles that
[851.60 - 855.52] you don't realize are highly poisonous
[853.92 - 856.48] when you're
[855.52 - 858.08] getting
[856.48 - 859.68] heavy metals from certain
[858.08 - 861.52] pharmaceuticals and that's another thing
[859.68 - 863.44] that makes her physical body different
[861.52 - 865.84] pharmaceuticals that can make her
[863.44 - 866.88] physical body different
[865.84 - 868.80] someone can be on a lot of
[866.88 - 870.40] antidepressants a lot of anti-anxiety
[868.80 - 871.92] meds somebody can be on a lot of
[870.40 - 873.36] different medications and it builds up
[871.92 - 874.32] and it builds up a lot of painkillers
[873.36 - 876.24] and it builds up and it builds up
[874.32 - 877.84] sleeping pills and it builds up right
[876.24 - 879.04] the whole bit and it builds up inside
[877.84 - 880.80] their liver and it builds up inside
[879.04 - 882.64] their organs and their kidneys and now
[880.80 - 884.56] they have a problem but that's what
[882.64 - 886.88] makes them different than somebody else
[884.56 - 889.04] who wasn't on all those medications it
[886.88 - 891.20] made them physically different that's
[889.04 - 893.52] the whole point what does somebody have
[891.20 - 895.04] what kind of bag of tricks bag of goods
[893.52 - 896.32] do they have inside their body what's
[895.04 - 898.08] sitting inside their liver what's
[896.32 - 900.08] sitting inside the kidneys what's inside
[898.08 - 902.64] their brain how many metals are inside
[900.08 - 902.64] their brain
[902.72 - 908.32] that determines too
[905.76 - 912.36] on how somebody feels julia says i will
[908.32 - 912.36] have to rewatch this video tomorrow
[912.48 - 915.84] you guys were alive right now
[914.64 - 917.76] so
[915.84 - 918.88] wellness is important because your
[917.76 - 920.40] depression can be different than
[918.88 - 921.84] somebody else's depression you see how
[920.40 - 924.24] it works your anxiety is different than
[921.84 - 926.56] somebody else's anxiety
[924.24 - 928.24] everybody has
[926.56 - 929.84] a different situation of what's
[928.24 - 931.76] happening inside of them both both
[929.84 - 933.20] toxicity levels and both pathogenic
[931.76 - 934.56] levels that are inside their body that
[933.20 - 938.32] determines
[934.56 - 942.00] which way things are gonna go
[938.32 - 944.16] definitely which way things are gonna go
[942.00 - 946.48] and all that is important to keep in
[944.16 - 946.48] mind
[946.80 - 949.92] so
[948.56 - 951.12] one thing we have to always remember
[949.92 - 952.88] though okay
[951.12 - 955.60] it's your experience is different than
[952.88 - 957.36] someone else's experience emotionally
[955.60 - 959.20] if you've been let down if you've been
[957.36 - 961.84] betrayed if you've had a hard time if
[959.20 - 964.00] something happened in your life man
[961.84 - 967.28] only you know
[964.00 - 968.88] only you know what that's like
[967.28 - 970.48] something terrible happened something
[968.88 - 972.32] going on so you're under pressure
[970.48 - 974.00] whatever it is something you were peer
[972.32 - 975.92] pressured into doing maybe something
[974.00 - 978.88] that's gone wrong in your life maybe
[975.92 - 982.32] some hardships maybe some struggles
[978.88 - 984.40] maybe some losses you lost some serious
[982.32 - 986.16] things that mattered in your life
[984.40 - 989.12] whatever that could be a loved one of
[986.16 - 990.64] course which we don't ever want to lose
[989.12 - 993.28] or a friend
[990.64 - 995.68] or something that was important to
[993.28 - 998.16] your existence
[995.68 - 1000.16] your resources whatever it is we lose it
[998.16 - 1001.92] plays a role in our soul and it shapes
[1000.16 - 1003.84] our soul and it changes our soul right
[1001.92 - 1005.04] there and no one can touch that man
[1003.84 - 1006.96] that's so
[1005.04 - 1009.44] unique to part of your soul your
[1006.96 - 1012.00] experiences of what you've been through
[1009.44 - 1013.20] the letdowns you've had the broken trust
[1012.00 - 1016.08] any of that
[1013.20 - 1018.64] the struggles emotional struggles
[1016.08 - 1020.72] all that's tied into the soul so deep
[1018.64 - 1022.24] and nobody could touch that nobody can
[1020.72 - 1024.88] go near that because you know what
[1022.24 - 1027.20] that's you that's yours that's your
[1024.88 - 1030.16] individual experience is right there
[1027.20 - 1032.08] that's what those are
[1030.16 - 1036.08] and they're powerful
[1032.08 - 1039.68] they're valuable too really valuable
[1036.08 - 1041.36] life is short here on planet earth boom
[1039.68 - 1043.44] short
[1041.36 - 1045.84] that's right
[1043.44 - 1048.48] you think 50 years 60 years 70 80 years
[1045.84 - 1048.48] 90 years
[1048.64 - 1053.36] i think that's a long time
[1051.60 - 1054.40] gone
[1053.36 - 1056.24] that's it
[1054.40 - 1059.12] real fast
[1056.24 - 1060.56] life is real short
[1059.12 - 1062.16] it really is i get it when you when
[1060.56 - 1063.60] you're 20 years older you're 22 years
[1062.16 - 1065.20] old you're 23 years old or something
[1063.60 - 1066.80] like that you think man you think life
[1065.20 - 1068.32] is forever you think you're gonna live
[1066.80 - 1069.68] forever you think
[1068.32 - 1071.20] life here
[1069.68 - 1073.04] is like
[1071.20 - 1075.28] you know you'll be here for a thousand
[1073.04 - 1078.00] years
[1075.28 - 1079.36] when you're 19 years old or 25 you're 28
[1078.00 - 1081.20] years old you might think you're here
[1079.36 - 1082.96] for a thousand years
[1081.20 - 1085.36] until you reach 30 and you start going
[1082.96 - 1086.64] 30 what the heck is that 30 i'm now i'm
[1085.36 - 1089.20] 30.
[1086.64 - 1091.28] and it starts to kind of almost shift a
[1089.20 - 1093.52] little for a lot of people but not quite
[1091.28 - 1095.92] yet
[1093.52 - 1098.80] life goes by
[1095.92 - 1102.24] really really quick
[1098.80 - 1102.24] it's a blip of time
[1102.32 - 1105.20] and our soul
[1105.28 - 1108.88] is still
[1106.96 - 1110.64] there
[1108.88 - 1112.48] it doesn't die
[1110.64 - 1115.12] we lose our physical bodies and that's
[1112.48 - 1117.84] the same thing we all have in common
[1115.12 - 1121.44] we're all the same
[1117.84 - 1122.48] every last one of us is all the same
[1121.44 - 1126.80] we breathe
[1122.48 - 1126.80] we live and eventually we die
[1127.92 - 1130.40] we leave
[1131.68 - 1138.08] every last one of us you ever look back
[1134.00 - 1138.08] at the old antique photos
[1138.56 - 1141.68] go in a bookstore and you're looking
[1140.00 - 1143.20] through books and you see some old book
[1141.68 - 1144.80] and the book is all these people and
[1143.20 - 1146.56] they're all sitting there by a farm and
[1144.80 - 1148.40] they're all like this with some rakes
[1146.56 - 1151.68] and shovels and they're just wearing
[1148.40 - 1154.16] these strange clothes right
[1151.68 - 1157.44] and it's black and white photos and it's
[1154.16 - 1160.72] like 1919 they're all gone
[1157.44 - 1160.72] they're all gone like that
[1162.80 - 1166.32] we're all the same
[1164.48 - 1167.60] we're all the same
[1166.32 - 1169.92] all of us
[1167.60 - 1172.00] every last one of us on this earth were
[1169.92 - 1175.44] the same
[1172.00 - 1179.04] every last one of us or sisters or
[1175.44 - 1182.56] brothers were all the same big family
[1179.04 - 1186.48] and we leave here and it goes quick
[1182.56 - 1188.00] but what makes us different is our soul
[1186.48 - 1190.56] and
[1188.00 - 1194.56] physical experiences that change the way
[1190.56 - 1196.88] your bodies function through this ride
[1194.56 - 1196.88] right
[1200.56 - 1204.16] thing is about
[1202.32 - 1205.92] if you ever worry about leaving this
[1204.16 - 1208.40] place down the road always remember your
[1205.92 - 1210.24] soul lives on forever
[1208.40 - 1212.80] your soul lives on forever and you're
[1210.24 - 1212.80] aware
[1212.96 - 1215.76] you're aware
[1216.40 - 1220.00] your soul
[1217.92 - 1223.44] has all the information
[1220.00 - 1225.52] it's an embodiment all on its own
[1223.44 - 1227.84] and it never dies
[1225.52 - 1227.84] ever
[1228.48 - 1233.52] anything you do good here
[1230.64 - 1237.20] anything the smallest little thing the
[1233.52 - 1240.72] smallest deed whatever it is
[1237.20 - 1243.92] your soul gets to carry that with you
[1240.72 - 1243.92] you tell somebody hey
[1244.80 - 1250.24] try the celery juice
[1247.12 - 1253.68] and they start getting their life back
[1250.24 - 1256.00] boom that's like gets in your soul
[1253.68 - 1258.40] you tell somebody
[1256.00 - 1260.16] anything or you help them with anything
[1258.40 - 1262.96] you help somebody across the street you
[1260.16 - 1265.76] help somebody
[1262.96 - 1268.08] go in front of you in a line
[1265.76 - 1269.76] whatever it is you pick something off
[1268.08 - 1272.48] the ground in the grocery store that
[1269.76 - 1275.04] someone just dropped she's he's the
[1272.48 - 1278.16] smallest things the smallest things
[1275.04 - 1283.12] the tiniest things
[1278.16 - 1284.80] save a moth a moth flew into the house
[1283.12 - 1287.04] and you grab it
[1284.80 - 1289.52] and you cup it like this and it's just a
[1287.04 - 1291.60] moth for god's sakes and you take them
[1289.52 - 1293.76] off and you let them moth out and you
[1291.60 - 1297.28] watch that ball fly away and maybe that
[1293.76 - 1299.60] moth only has a year or season in it
[1297.28 - 1301.92] but you let it go when something happens
[1299.60 - 1303.20] inside your soul and you take that with
[1301.92 - 1305.12] you
[1303.20 - 1307.92] that's what powers our soul that's what
[1305.12 - 1307.92] powers our soul
[1308.64 - 1311.36] when it comes down to our physical
[1310.08 - 1312.72] problems though
[1311.36 - 1314.88] and our physical
[1312.72 - 1316.96] abilities and all that that change is
[1314.88 - 1318.40] really fast you get some heavy metals in
[1316.96 - 1320.40] the brain which i want to do a heavy
[1318.40 - 1322.48] metal detox cleanse
[1320.40 - 1324.40] challenge sometime i don't know when but
[1322.48 - 1325.84] i want to focus on it because metals are
[1324.40 - 1327.60] so critical
[1325.84 - 1330.24] you get metals of the brain copper
[1327.60 - 1331.76] aluminum mercury changes everything and
[1330.24 - 1333.44] the next thing you know it got the brain
[1331.76 - 1335.84] fog and the focus and concentration
[1333.44 - 1337.36] problems depression anxiety meaning
[1335.84 - 1339.28] mysterious depression anxiety you might
[1337.36 - 1340.88] have anxiety because of what's happening
[1339.28 - 1343.20] in the world the unjust
[1340.88 - 1345.04] the unjust evils that are happening in
[1343.20 - 1347.52] this world and that's a different kind
[1345.04 - 1349.84] of anxiety or the unjust evils that are
[1347.52 - 1353.84] causing depression right now
[1349.84 - 1356.48] i've always said evils on this planet
[1353.84 - 1358.80] there are evil evil demonic people on
[1356.48 - 1360.72] this planet that have no respect for
[1358.80 - 1362.96] human life i've always said that all
[1360.72 - 1363.68] these years
[1362.96 - 1365.44] and
[1363.68 - 1367.84] when that interferes with any of our
[1365.44 - 1370.08] lives on any scale whatsoever can create
[1367.84 - 1371.76] some depression anxiety because it hits
[1370.08 - 1373.76] the emotional centers of the brain and
[1371.76 - 1375.20] then we get injured and i talked about
[1373.76 - 1378.24] that and cleanse the heel a little bit
[1375.20 - 1380.40] about that emotional injury in our brain
[1378.24 - 1381.84] and how it works we get a little scar
[1380.40 - 1383.28] tissue on the brain and that makes you
[1381.84 - 1385.04] different right there if you're somebody
[1383.28 - 1386.72] that experienced a hardship
[1385.04 - 1389.84] and that emotional center of the brain
[1386.72 - 1391.68] got whacked and hit hard then then that
[1389.84 - 1394.40] right there determines hey you got that
[1391.68 - 1395.92] injury that's specific to you and now
[1394.40 - 1397.68] you have a depression that's different
[1395.92 - 1400.24] than somebody else's depression no one's
[1397.68 - 1401.84] depression is exactly the same metals
[1400.24 - 1403.44] can be in a different part of the brain
[1401.84 - 1405.28] than somebody else and an emotional
[1403.44 - 1406.72] experience can be in a different part
[1405.28 - 1409.36] the emotional centers of the brain than
[1406.72 - 1409.36] somebody else
[1409.44 - 1416.28] and everybody has a different
[1412.16 - 1416.28] situation going on
[1416.56 - 1420.80] what i noticed about some people out
[1418.32 - 1422.48] there that want to destroy
[1420.80 - 1424.08] the futures of people who need their
[1422.48 - 1425.76] health back
[1424.08 - 1427.76] what i notice is
[1425.76 - 1430.40] some people will browse the brass
[1427.76 - 1432.40] through medical medium information
[1430.40 - 1433.92] and they'll pick and choose some things
[1432.40 - 1435.44] out of medical medium they won't
[1433.92 - 1437.12] understand the message from medical
[1435.44 - 1440.24] medium information they don't understand
[1437.12 - 1443.48] that i'm a messenger i'm nobody
[1440.24 - 1443.48] i'm nobody
[1444.00 - 1449.84] nobody that's what i am
[1446.88 - 1451.76] people say oh medical medium i'm nothing
[1449.84 - 1455.04] nothing i'm a messenger
[1451.76 - 1457.60] i'll be here today gone tomorrow
[1455.04 - 1460.56] down the road but what will be here will
[1457.60 - 1462.48] be the information that i messaged out
[1460.56 - 1465.36] from above
[1462.48 - 1467.36] that information will be here
[1465.36 - 1469.68] it'll be there to speak in a light in
[1467.36 - 1473.84] hopes to save more lives
[1469.68 - 1473.84] in hopes to save more lives
[1474.80 - 1479.44] because i'm just a messenger in the
[1477.28 - 1482.24] moment in this time in history so i can
[1479.44 - 1484.32] deliver this information from above
[1482.24 - 1487.84] i'm nothing special
[1484.32 - 1487.84] for some reason
[1488.48 - 1492.08] i was given the ability to hear
[1492.24 - 1494.72] and
[1493.28 - 1497.04] survive
[1494.72 - 1497.04] that
[1497.28 - 1500.88] torture of hearing a voice
[1499.60 - 1502.80] and bringing information that's
[1500.88 - 1505.52] different than any other information out
[1502.80 - 1505.52] there in health
[1506.08 - 1509.36] and
[1507.68 - 1511.12] i think it angers a lot of people
[1509.36 - 1512.80] because a lot of people see that medical
[1511.12 - 1514.48] meme information is the only information
[1512.80 - 1516.00] that's different
[1514.48 - 1517.52] and all the other information in
[1516.00 - 1519.20] alternative health
[1517.52 - 1522.16] is the same
[1519.20 - 1525.76] it parrots the same
[1522.16 - 1528.24] it's like all the same stuff
[1525.76 - 1529.44] then medical medium information is
[1528.24 - 1531.84] different
[1529.44 - 1534.32] because it's different
[1531.84 - 1535.68] and it's healed so many people it's a
[1534.32 - 1538.88] threat
[1535.68 - 1541.36] it's a great threat to the industry
[1538.88 - 1542.80] then the industry likes to
[1541.36 - 1545.44] come up with all kinds of different
[1542.80 - 1545.44] tactics
[1548.00 - 1553.28] people need to understand that
[1551.28 - 1555.36] as a messenger it's not about the
[1553.28 - 1557.68] anthony williams show if it was going to
[1555.36 - 1559.20] be the anthony williams show
[1557.68 - 1562.48] then i would have just made it the
[1559.20 - 1564.16] anthony williams show and did selfies 24
[1562.48 - 1566.32] 7 and
[1564.16 - 1568.00] made it all about me and
[1566.32 - 1570.00] hey look guys i'm down at the beach
[1568.00 - 1571.44] right now and got my selfies out and a
[1570.00 - 1573.04] whole bit and been about look it's the
[1571.44 - 1574.48] anthony williams show and by the way
[1573.04 - 1575.44] here's health too because i'm into
[1574.48 - 1576.80] health
[1575.44 - 1579.04] i'm a health obviously i'm into health
[1576.80 - 1580.96] too and the anthony williams show
[1579.04 - 1582.32] if it was going to be about the anthony
[1580.96 - 1583.84] williams show i would have done a bunch
[1582.32 - 1585.44] of different tv show series like i've
[1583.84 - 1586.72] been asked to do and i'm like well you
[1585.44 - 1588.00] know what yeah i want to get the
[1586.72 - 1589.68] information out there but i don't want
[1588.00 - 1593.04] to make it about the anthony williams
[1589.68 - 1595.92] show because i'm a messenger
[1593.04 - 1597.28] i'm not supposed to be a star of any
[1595.92 - 1600.24] kind
[1597.28 - 1601.60] i'm not supposed to be
[1600.24 - 1604.08] anyone
[1601.60 - 1607.84] i'm supposed to be nothing
[1604.08 - 1610.64] but yet a voice for the chronically ill
[1607.84 - 1613.04] a voice for spirit of compassion
[1610.64 - 1615.28] so i can deliver the message out to
[1613.04 - 1616.24] people so they
[1615.28 - 1618.00] don't
[1616.24 - 1622.88] end up
[1618.00 - 1622.88] in a situation like so many people are
[1622.96 - 1626.40] so
[1623.84 - 1627.84] i was looking right
[1626.40 - 1629.44] and
[1627.84 - 1631.52] i saw
[1629.44 - 1633.84] i'm on my phone right now okay you guys
[1631.52 - 1635.92] so i'm on my phone right so i'm just
[1633.84 - 1638.16] going to to uh
[1635.92 - 1640.08] a review right
[1638.16 - 1641.84] so here's a review just came out a
[1640.08 - 1644.08] couple days ago
[1641.84 - 1644.08] okay
[1644.32 - 1648.32] the title of the review is that
[1646.24 - 1650.64] everything in this book works when for
[1648.32 - 1653.44] over a decade nothing else would so
[1650.64 - 1656.48] this person says when over a decade
[1653.44 - 1656.48] nothing else could
[1656.56 - 1661.12] right this is an amazon review
[1660.00 - 1664.00] so
[1661.12 - 1666.08] the review is this thank god for the
[1664.00 - 1669.76] information in this book it has
[1666.08 - 1672.32] literally saved my life i had been to 21
[1669.76 - 1674.80] doctors
[1672.32 - 1676.80] 21 doctors
[1674.80 - 1679.44] i get it when you're 20 years old and
[1676.80 - 1681.44] you just have a bellyache once in a
[1679.44 - 1683.12] while a little bit uploading which is
[1681.44 - 1685.28] still not good
[1683.12 - 1686.96] maybe a tiny bit of acne
[1685.28 - 1688.32] maybe a little bit of fatigue and you
[1686.96 - 1689.52] run around to your functional medicine
[1688.32 - 1691.68] doctors and the functional medicine
[1689.52 - 1693.68] doctor says oh your gut dysbiosis is
[1691.68 - 1696.64] happening and you need a little this and
[1693.68 - 1698.96] try a little of that you think you got
[1696.64 - 1701.28] it all down and then you go and you put
[1698.96 - 1703.12] a post out
[1701.28 - 1704.40] thinking that you have everything down
[1703.12 - 1706.16] right
[1704.40 - 1708.40] but when you're somebody that's been to
[1706.16 - 1710.56] 21 doctors and you're really sick and
[1708.40 - 1712.16] you're really ill that's what medical
[1710.56 - 1714.32] medium information has been for all
[1712.16 - 1716.32] these years
[1714.32 - 1718.40] so thank god for the information in this
[1716.32 - 1721.36] book it has literally saved my life i
[1718.40 - 1723.76] have been to 21 doctors prior to finding
[1721.36 - 1725.60] the books written by anthony williams it
[1723.76 - 1727.88] was his celery juice that first peaked
[1725.60 - 1729.84] my curiosity so i went to
[1727.88 - 1731.44] medicalmedium.com to research when
[1729.84 - 1733.84] literally in the in the first two
[1731.44 - 1735.68] paragraphs on his home page at the time
[1733.84 - 1738.48] all the answers i had been looking for
[1735.68 - 1740.88] fell into place and made perfect sense i
[1738.48 - 1743.60] found that no wonder doctors couldn't
[1740.88 - 1745.36] heal arthritis because there is no such
[1743.60 - 1747.76] thing as autoimmune
[1745.36 - 1750.96] my health problems were there because of
[1747.76 - 1753.44] a virus not because my immune system was
[1750.96 - 1757.12] attacking me and getting
[1753.44 - 1757.12] into attacking me right
[1758.64 - 1763.76] and the review goes on and on
[1761.44 - 1765.04] but it's somebody who's been to 21
[1763.76 - 1766.48] doctors
[1765.04 - 1768.96] and the thing about medical medium
[1766.48 - 1770.80] information i was always a messenger to
[1768.96 - 1773.44] just make sure that hey
[1770.80 - 1776.56] if you're in that position you got a
[1773.44 - 1777.84] shot now you know here here it is so it
[1776.56 - 1780.16] wasn't supposed to be the anthony
[1777.84 - 1781.92] williams show
[1780.16 - 1785.44] it was supposed to be
[1781.92 - 1788.16] i'm a messenger i'm nobody
[1785.44 - 1791.92] i just have to make sure people have an
[1788.16 - 1793.52] opportunity get that information
[1791.92 - 1795.44] bring it down
[1793.52 - 1797.04] be able to voice it
[1795.44 - 1799.12] and be able to back up the chronically
[1797.04 - 1800.72] ill
[1799.12 - 1803.37] and make sure that i'm a voice for the
[1800.72 - 1804.96] chronically ill too
[1803.37 - 1806.64] [Music]
[1804.96 - 1808.64] the other day
[1806.64 - 1811.44] someone brought up bio
[1808.64 - 1813.44] individual okay
[1811.44 - 1816.32] medical medium they said
[1813.44 - 1817.76] does all these things wrong
[1816.32 - 1819.60] and they said medical medium does all
[1817.76 - 1821.20] these things wrong because their medical
[1819.60 - 1823.28] medium information is different than any
[1821.20 - 1824.64] other information in
[1823.28 - 1826.96] the health field
[1824.64 - 1827.92] yeah it's different it's geared to save
[1826.96 - 1830.32] lives
[1827.92 - 1832.96] it's there for when you see 21 doctors
[1830.32 - 1836.36] and 25 doctors 21 doctors that's a small
[1832.96 - 1836.36] amount of doctors
[1836.64 - 1840.56] medical medium information has been here
[1838.24 - 1842.64] for people who've seen 50 doctors
[1840.56 - 1844.64] actually a hundred doctors
[1842.64 - 1847.84] one person
[1844.64 - 1849.60] said they went to 400 doctors in 20
[1847.84 - 1852.80] years
[1849.60 - 1854.64] before medical medium information
[1852.80 - 1857.76] not only gave them a fighting chance but
[1854.64 - 1860.16] reversed their problems
[1857.76 - 1862.40] uma says i've seen people use mm info to
[1860.16 - 1865.28] heal and then turn against mm and go
[1862.40 - 1867.84] sell zeolite or alkaline water machines
[1865.28 - 1869.68] absolutely in fact the sabotages
[1867.84 - 1872.00] sabotage on the medical mean community
[1869.68 - 1873.36] are people very angry
[1872.00 - 1875.36] because
[1873.36 - 1877.52] medical medium healed them and then they
[1875.36 - 1878.96] wanted to sell their alkaline ionizer
[1877.52 - 1881.12] water machine
[1878.96 - 1883.44] medical medium doesn't support ionizer
[1881.12 - 1887.28] water machines because
[1883.44 - 1890.32] that will make you neurologically sick
[1887.28 - 1892.32] the plates inside the machines
[1890.32 - 1895.20] they start to decompose you don't see it
[1892.32 - 1897.20] decomposing but they do they oxidize
[1895.20 - 1900.32] and you get sick and twisted in the
[1897.20 - 1902.24] brain from alkaline as your water water
[1900.32 - 1903.84] my job is to protect the chronically ill
[1902.24 - 1906.64] but what that did was create a bunch of
[1903.84 - 1908.64] enemies so that the enemies that sell
[1906.64 - 1910.56] the machines start getting people to
[1908.64 - 1911.84] post
[1910.56 - 1913.52] and then you see a bunch of people that
[1911.84 - 1915.20] don't know any of this that go whoa i'm
[1913.52 - 1917.20] not going to go near medical medium then
[1915.20 - 1918.96] i won't look at his book i i'll go
[1917.20 - 1921.92] somewhere else
[1918.96 - 1923.60] that's a mark on your soul man
[1921.92 - 1925.36] when you do evil things like that and
[1923.60 - 1926.96] you turn people a direction that they
[1925.36 - 1928.32] could have gotten help and you turn them
[1926.96 - 1931.12] away from that
[1928.32 - 1935.92] some evil intentions
[1931.12 - 1937.84] that stays in the soul you do evil crap
[1935.92 - 1941.28] that stays in your soul
[1937.84 - 1941.28] for eternity
[1942.24 - 1944.48] so
[1944.64 - 1948.88] so what happens is it brings on a whole
[1946.32 - 1951.60] bunch of hit jobs and hit post and stuff
[1948.88 - 1954.56] like that right so let's just let's just
[1951.60 - 1956.48] read one that came out pretty recently
[1954.56 - 1959.36] this post is titled what does the
[1956.48 - 1960.88] medical medium get wrong
[1959.36 - 1963.36] we'd love to hear what medical medium
[1960.88 - 1964.80] gets wrong this is interesting
[1963.36 - 1967.36] right
[1964.80 - 1969.76] okay let's just read one of these things
[1967.36 - 1972.80] the body needs acidity too much
[1969.76 - 1976.24] alkalinity can cause more infections low
[1972.80 - 1978.32] hcl and poor mitochondrial health well
[1976.24 - 1979.44] that doesn't really sum up too much
[1978.32 - 1981.68] right there
[1979.44 - 1983.20] so medical medium gets what wrong kind
[1981.68 - 1984.40] of confused with just that one all on
[1983.20 - 1986.48] its own
[1984.40 - 1988.72] so this person is saying
[1986.48 - 1991.04] the body needs acidity here's the
[1988.72 - 1992.72] problem everybody's so darn acidic
[1991.04 - 1994.56] they're losing their bodies
[1992.72 - 1996.48] this person is an amateur i guess and
[1994.56 - 1999.68] they just don't know this
[1996.48 - 2002.96] we're so acidic we get osteopenia
[1999.68 - 2006.00] osteoporosis spinal stenosis
[2002.96 - 2006.96] we're so acidic that our brain bathes in
[2006.00 - 2010.64] acid
[2006.96 - 2014.56] and atrophies as the ears go on
[2010.64 - 2016.56] we're so acidic that we burn out our hcl
[2014.56 - 2020.16] our our own hydrochloric acid and
[2016.56 - 2021.68] stomach glands we're so acidic
[2020.16 - 2023.76] that we ruin
[2021.68 - 2025.68] the other acidity
[2023.76 - 2027.20] which is hcl
[2025.68 - 2029.52] so this person says the body needs
[2027.20 - 2032.64] acidity oh it does actually we're
[2029.52 - 2035.12] desperate to get out of acidosis
[2032.64 - 2036.96] for somebody to say this and say what
[2035.12 - 2038.16] medical what the does the medical medium
[2036.96 - 2039.52] get wrong so they're trying to correct
[2038.16 - 2041.68] me with this one they're saying the body
[2039.52 - 2043.76] needs acidity medical medium
[2041.68 - 2044.96] too much alkalinity
[2043.76 - 2046.80] do you know how hard it is to get
[2044.96 - 2048.96] alkaline
[2046.80 - 2050.56] you have to be eating leafy greens every
[2048.96 - 2052.72] single day you've got to be doing your
[2050.56 - 2054.80] celery juice you've got to be cautious
[2052.72 - 2056.16] on you got to keep dairy out of your
[2054.80 - 2057.68] diet right
[2056.16 - 2059.76] you got you got to watch out for
[2057.68 - 2062.40] chemical poisons and toxins it's not
[2059.76 - 2063.44] easy to get alkaline but this person's
[2062.40 - 2065.92] acting like
[2063.44 - 2068.56] alkalinity is like easy to get to and
[2065.92 - 2070.64] that we need to be acidic instead
[2068.56 - 2073.44] if you take this person's advice it's a
[2070.64 - 2075.60] nightmare how's anybody gonna heal let's
[2073.44 - 2078.64] move on to another one
[2075.60 - 2081.60] okay well this is a fun one right here
[2078.64 - 2083.76] veganism has a time and place just like
[2081.60 - 2085.28] all other therapeutic diets so what this
[2083.76 - 2087.60] person is saying
[2085.28 - 2089.76] is that i must be straight vegan and
[2087.60 - 2091.36] only vegan and that's all i ever support
[2089.76 - 2092.96] is vegan
[2091.36 - 2095.28] let's just clear this up for a little
[2092.96 - 2097.20] bit right now
[2095.28 - 2099.68] do you know why the vegans don't like
[2097.20 - 2101.52] medical medium out there the the staunch
[2099.68 - 2105.76] veganism world
[2101.52 - 2107.60] because i support animal protein eaters
[2105.76 - 2109.52] did you know
[2107.60 - 2112.16] that the plant-based movement and the
[2109.52 - 2115.20] vegan movement despises anthony william
[2112.16 - 2119.84] the medical medium because i will not
[2115.20 - 2122.32] solely and solely only support vegans
[2119.84 - 2124.40] i'm hated by the vegans yes i know so
[2122.32 - 2126.08] many of you guys are vegan but the vegan
[2124.40 - 2128.80] movement you guys know the vegan
[2126.08 - 2130.88] movement hates medical medium because i
[2128.80 - 2132.88] don't sit there and talk about all the
[2130.88 - 2136.32] vegan talking points and the vegan
[2132.88 - 2139.28] propaganda and i'm not just 100
[2136.32 - 2141.60] i the medical medium platform or
[2139.28 - 2144.08] community or the medical medium
[2141.60 - 2146.48] information supports all walks of life
[2144.08 - 2148.96] that eat all kinds of different ways
[2146.48 - 2150.48] there are animal protein people here
[2148.96 - 2152.16] there are plant-based people here
[2150.48 - 2155.12] there's macrobiotic people here there's
[2152.16 - 2157.60] vegetarians here there's people that eat
[2155.12 - 2160.40] dirt there's people that eat animals
[2157.60 - 2162.64] there's people that eat just blueberries
[2160.40 - 2163.84] there's people from all walks of life
[2162.64 - 2165.60] here
[2163.84 - 2167.04] but this person puts out in their posts
[2165.60 - 2167.92] to make sure they twist the minds of
[2167.04 - 2169.84] others
[2167.92 - 2171.76] that veganism has a time in place just
[2169.84 - 2173.28] like all other therapeutic diets so
[2171.76 - 2174.96] anthony williams
[2173.28 - 2177.20] must have it wrong then because he must
[2174.96 - 2178.32] be just a one size fits all just vegan
[2177.20 - 2179.84] because that's what they're claiming so
[2178.32 - 2182.08] let's move on to another one if you guys
[2179.84 - 2185.28] got a second
[2182.08 - 2188.16] this is kind of fun ready for this one
[2185.28 - 2189.92] vinegar is not inherently bad
[2188.16 - 2191.36] oh it's not
[2189.92 - 2193.92] okay
[2191.36 - 2197.52] if a person has a problem with vinegar
[2193.92 - 2201.20] they may have low hcl oxalate issues etc
[2197.52 - 2203.44] really to who's science what science can
[2201.20 - 2206.64] prove that or even say that
[2203.44 - 2208.48] someone's just throwing theories
[2206.64 - 2209.92] that are in the alternative medicine
[2208.48 - 2211.20] world
[2209.92 - 2213.28] and they're just throwing it into the
[2211.20 - 2214.88] bag here so what does the medical medium
[2213.28 - 2216.40] get wrong apparently the medical medium
[2214.88 - 2218.56] has it wrong the
[2216.40 - 2220.24] vinegar is actually good for you
[2218.56 - 2221.28] so let's cut into the vinegar a little
[2220.24 - 2223.12] bit
[2221.28 - 2224.48] yeah you're welcome to have vinegar and
[2223.12 - 2226.00] i always said
[2224.48 - 2227.84] if you're gonna have vinegar apple cider
[2226.00 - 2229.04] vinegar is the best one there is i've
[2227.84 - 2230.24] written it in my books that it's the
[2229.04 - 2231.68] best one there is but if you're
[2230.24 - 2233.28] chronically ill
[2231.68 - 2234.72] and the needle's not moving you better
[2233.28 - 2237.44] get rid of the vinegar because i want
[2234.72 - 2238.96] you to have a fighting chance to heal

[2246.72 - 2250.08] least you're doing the apple cider
[2247.92 - 2251.92] vinegar but listen if you got those

[2266.16 - 2269.12] get rid of the vinegar because the
[2267.36 - 2270.48] vinegar will literally destroy your
[2269.12 - 2272.72] health
[2270.48 - 2274.00] but by no means do i ever punish anybody
[2272.72 - 2277.20] if they want to be in the community and
[2274.00 - 2279.12] have vinegar tara appleman hey tara
[2277.20 - 2281.12] i love when people use the phrase one
[2279.12 - 2283.60] size fits all to describe medical medium
[2281.12 - 2286.88] information mm info is the only thing i
[2283.60 - 2288.96] found that is not one size fits all
[2286.88 - 2290.40] tara
[2288.96 - 2292.88] it's true
[2290.40 - 2292.88] it's true
[2294.56 - 2299.12] so
[2296.56 - 2300.96] this person clearly who wrote this and
[2299.12 - 2303.04] posted about this hasn't watched
[2300.96 - 2304.96] instagram lives or facebook lives or
[2303.04 - 2307.52] rumble lives hasn't read the medical
[2304.96 - 2309.92] medium books but they did a hit job and
[2307.52 - 2311.68] they haven't listened to the podcasts so
[2309.92 - 2314.00] they did a hit job
[2311.68 - 2315.60] and since i bring in the soul into this
[2314.00 - 2318.32] stuff you know that just sits in your
[2315.60 - 2319.92] soul you do a hit job on purpose when
[2318.32 - 2321.20] you didn't do your homework or know
[2319.92 - 2323.28] about the other person so you
[2321.20 - 2324.80] intentionally did something evil and
[2323.28 - 2326.96] then you got your crowd of whatever
[2324.80 - 2328.56] followers behind it and they all think
[2326.96 - 2330.88] it's real
[2328.56 - 2333.44] that intention is dark
[2330.88 - 2336.88] what would actually possess
[2333.44 - 2339.44] a person a 20 year old or whoever that
[2336.88 - 2343.04] does this what would possess them to do
[2339.44 - 2345.44] dark malice intentions like that to
[2343.04 - 2347.12] derail people of healing when they don't
[2345.44 - 2348.64] even know the information or they ever
[2347.12 - 2350.96] even read the books
[2348.64 - 2352.24] and that stays in the soul forever
[2350.96 - 2353.52] they may not think that because you
[2352.24 - 2354.96] think you're indestructible when you're
[2353.52 - 2356.08] 20 years old and you think you got it
[2354.96 - 2357.52] all down because your functional
[2356.08 - 2359.44] medicine doctor taught you a few things
[2357.52 - 2361.44] about gut biome which is really theory
[2359.44 - 2363.04] gut microbiome and we can talk about
[2361.44 - 2365.60] that all day on how that works because
[2363.04 - 2367.36] if you're really ill those gut powders
[2365.60 - 2369.52] don't do anything you have to learn how
[2367.36 - 2371.12] to heal
[2369.52 - 2373.28] mollyanne marsh says i'm glad you are
[2371.12 - 2375.12] addressing this
[2373.28 - 2377.20] i have to dispel the misinformation to
[2375.12 - 2379.68] help people avoid the traps because
[2377.20 - 2381.12] these are trapped set by people
[2379.68 - 2382.64] let's go and do a couple more if you
[2381.12 - 2384.48] guys got a minute
[2382.64 - 2385.76] i really appreciate it
[2384.48 - 2387.36] okay
[2385.76 - 2388.64] you guys are gonna laugh at this one if
[2387.36 - 2389.84] you're if you know medical medium
[2388.64 - 2392.88] information you're gonna laugh at this
[2389.84 - 2395.20] one catherine says and that crowd healed
[2392.88 - 2396.96] with your info too and now they're
[2395.20 - 2398.80] bashing it catherine i know because
[2396.96 - 2400.88] people that were actually commenting in
[2398.80 - 2402.64] that crowd healed from using medical
[2400.88 - 2405.28] medium tools and they're sitting there
[2402.64 - 2405.28] bashing it
[2406.56 - 2410.16] we have bad things happening in the
[2408.00 - 2412.24] world right now we have evil immense
[2410.16 - 2415.20] evil destroying
[2412.24 - 2416.32] people's lives right now out there
[2415.20 - 2418.80] okay
[2416.32 - 2420.24] immense evil an evil immense evil
[2418.80 - 2422.32] machine
[2420.24 - 2424.88] is trying to destroy
[2422.32 - 2425.68] people's worlds and lives right now out
[2424.88 - 2426.96] there
[2425.68 - 2428.16] if you're up on everything that's
[2426.96 - 2430.16] happening
[2428.16 - 2431.12] right
[2430.16 - 2433.12] but
[2431.12 - 2435.04] on small levels
[2433.12 - 2438.80] smaller levels
[2435.04 - 2440.88] this is people who post this garbage
[2438.80 - 2442.48] are trying to destroy people's worlds
[2440.88 - 2445.20] too
[2442.48 - 2448.40] when you think about that
[2445.20 - 2451.40] or trying to destroy people's worlds
[2448.40 - 2451.40] okay
[2452.88 - 2459.12] so it's unbelievable
[2455.68 - 2461.84] brianna says i seen this gal's post
[2459.12 - 2462.88] post like this really does mess with my
[2461.84 - 2465.44] head
[2462.88 - 2467.20] like makes me think i will never heal
[2465.44 - 2470.08] and doing things wrong
[2467.20 - 2471.52] brian i'm so sorry i know
[2470.08 - 2474.08] and that's the post we're probably
[2471.52 - 2477.12] talking about for sure right now
[2474.08 - 2479.20] so let's go into a little bit more
[2477.12 - 2481.84] but before i go into these pieces i just
[2479.20 - 2484.40] want to say there's an evil machine
[2481.84 - 2486.96] trying to literally destroy
[2484.40 - 2489.04] humankind right now we know about that
[2486.96 - 2491.12] but this is on small levels that destroy
[2489.04 - 2493.04] lives too
[2491.12 - 2494.32] when you put stuff like this out there
[2493.04 - 2496.48] when you don't even know what's in the
[2494.32 - 2498.96] books or the podcasts or understand why
[2496.48 - 2501.12] someone's even sick and you put a tax
[2498.96 - 2503.28] like this out here and you alter
[2501.12 - 2505.28] people's perceptions and send them down
[2503.28 - 2506.96] a direction so they can't heal people
[2505.28 - 2509.12] are going to be poisoned when they see
[2506.96 - 2510.88] this they'll never think oh well maybe i
[2509.12 - 2512.16] should look at a medical mean book
[2510.88 - 2514.00] that's that's the number one new york
[2512.16 - 2515.36] times bestseller that's healed people
[2514.00 - 2517.36] around the world
[2515.36 - 2519.76] maybe i should never look at that guy
[2517.36 - 2521.60] maybe that guy is ugly maybe that guy
[2519.76 - 2523.76] does look weird
[2521.60 - 2525.84] you guys first of all i'm not young i'm
[2523.76 - 2528.32] an older guy
[2525.84 - 2529.68] second of all i don't have fake teeth i

[2540.16 - 2542.72] all the guys in the health movement
[2541.68 - 2545.20] right now
[2542.72 - 2547.68] that are a half of my age are getting
[2545.20 - 2550.08] all that stuff
[2547.68 - 2551.60] and all the guys that are my age in the
[2550.08 - 2553.28] health movement right now they don't

[2567.84 - 2571.52] i'm not trying to build mass if i wanted
[2569.76 - 2572.72] to i could just spend two hours three
[2571.52 - 2575.04] hours a day and do that but i have to
[2572.72 - 2578.40] work
[2575.04 - 2579.76] i have a job
[2578.40 - 2581.68] all right so let's go in just a little
[2579.76 - 2583.04] bit plus you won't get good bike rides
[2581.68 - 2584.48] when you do that and you won't get good
[2583.04 - 2585.84] runs you won't be able to run the miles
[2584.48 - 2586.88] you want to run when you're too bulked
[2585.84 - 2588.40] up
[2586.88 - 2590.24] i know guys that are so bulked up
[2588.40 - 2592.40] friends of mine are so bulked up they
[2590.24 - 2594.08] could run a half mile
[2592.40 - 2595.44] they can't run 10 miles real quick in
[2594.08 - 2596.80] the morning and then get back to work
[2595.44 - 2599.28] they can only run a half mile and then
[2596.80 - 2600.32] they're dragging
[2599.28 - 2602.64] all right
[2600.32 - 2603.76] look that's off a beaten path so let's
[2602.64 - 2604.80] oh let's talk about another one right
[2603.76 - 2606.24] here right here's the one that's
[2604.80 - 2609.44] interesting you guys check this one out
[2606.24 - 2611.92] from the from this post from this person
[2609.44 - 2614.08] he does not state that binders should be
[2611.92 - 2616.08] used when ingestion when ingesting the
[2614.08 - 2617.60] heavy metal detox smoothie so you're
[2616.08 - 2620.40] going to tell me how my heavy metal
[2617.60 - 2621.52] detox smoothie should work is that what
[2620.40 - 2622.96] you're gonna do
[2621.52 - 2624.96] is that this person is gonna do this
[2622.96 - 2626.96] person's gonna give me direction on how
[2624.96 - 2629.28] my heavy metal detox smoothie that saved
[2626.96 - 2631.44] lives is gonna work
[2629.28 - 2634.88] so oh
[2631.44 - 2636.56] um let me just listen to you then
[2634.88 - 2638.32] what am i doing wrong with my heavy
[2636.56 - 2640.40] metal detox smoothie that's been saving
[2638.32 - 2642.40] lives for decades
[2640.40 - 2644.48] uh okay let's talk about you want me to
[2642.40 - 2647.60] put binders in there
[2644.48 - 2648.72] okay what are binders charcoal
[2647.60 - 2651.76] clay
[2648.72 - 2653.60] chlorella fulvic acid
[2651.76 - 2655.68] you want me to put humic acid you want
[2653.60 - 2658.00] me to put these binders in
[2655.68 - 2660.00] um those are theories they don't grab
[2658.00 - 2661.92] toxic heavy metals
[2660.00 - 2664.00] there's not one study that shows
[2661.92 - 2665.60] charcoal grabbing or binding onto a
[2664.00 - 2667.52] toxic heavy metal
[2665.60 - 2669.84] there's not one study that shows that
[2667.52 - 2671.76] you need a binder
[2669.84 - 2673.44] there's not one study of any of that
[2671.76 - 2675.44] because first of all the heavy metal
[2673.44 - 2677.68] world of toxic heavy metals causing
[2675.44 - 2679.84] problems originates from 35 years of my
[2677.68 - 2681.92] work of teaching people
[2679.84 - 2684.80] and the heavy metal detox smoothie
[2681.92 - 2685.76] that's saving lives
[2684.80 - 2687.76] has
[2685.76 - 2690.08] spirulina in there
[2687.76 - 2692.72] barley grass juice powder in there
[2690.08 - 2695.04] cilantro in there while blueberries
[2692.72 - 2698.40] pecked in from wild blueberries
[2695.04 - 2701.60] pectin's a binder
[2698.40 - 2703.92] pectin's a binder it's got two cups of
[2701.60 - 2707.04] wild blueberries in the heavy metal
[2703.92 - 2707.04] detox smoothie
[2707.28 - 2710.96] the point is is someone sitting here who
[2708.96 - 2712.48] doesn't even know how metals work or
[2710.96 - 2714.24] anything and they're telling me i don't
[2712.48 - 2716.72] address binders
[2714.24 - 2718.24] april 10. i got put on binders by my
[2716.72 - 2719.76] health coach really didn't help me and
[2718.24 - 2721.12] can i tell you april
[2719.76 - 2724.64] binders
[2721.12 - 2726.48] i've seen it hospitalize people
[2724.64 - 2727.92] i've seen people use binders like
[2726.48 - 2730.00] charcoal and clay and end up in the
[2727.92 - 2731.44] hospital with crohn's and colitis serum
[2730.00 - 2733.04] severely suffering and they had
[2731.44 - 2734.56] literally lost two three months of their
[2733.04 - 2736.88] life they were in the hospital because
[2734.56 - 2738.64] the clay got into their intestinal tract
[2736.88 - 2740.32] and colon and stuck into the walls and
[2738.64 - 2741.84] they were in agony and needed to be put
[2740.32 - 2745.12] on morphine
[2741.84 - 2748.88] i don't use charcoal and clays for a
[2745.12 - 2751.36] reason it can destroy people's lives i
[2748.88 - 2753.52] don't like them i told people why many
[2751.36 - 2756.16] times corella is also highly toxic and
[2753.52 - 2758.64] carries bacteria 90 of the time and i've
[2756.16 - 2761.36] seen kids that were on chlorella from
[2758.64 - 2763.52] their practitioners literally in
[2761.36 - 2765.20] hospital beds because i'm morphine
[2763.52 - 2766.72] because the corella had bacteria and
[2765.20 - 2769.52] almost killed them
[2766.72 - 2771.28] it's in my books this stuff
[2769.52 - 2772.80] so i have a person here that's so
[2771.28 - 2775.92] experienced i'm not trying to be
[2772.80 - 2778.00] sarcastic but so experienced apparently
[2775.92 - 2779.76] it says he does not state that binders
[2778.00 - 2781.68] should be used when ingesting the heavy
[2779.76 - 2783.44] metal detox smoothie are on his detox
[2781.68 - 2785.68] lenses
[2783.44 - 2787.52] jamie says your heavy metal detox movie
[2785.68 - 2789.44] helped me get rid of my panic disorder
[2787.52 - 2791.04] yeah and if there were binders such as
[2789.44 - 2792.48] charcoal in there your panic disorder
[2791.04 - 2795.68] would have got worse because the
[2792.48 - 2797.60] charcoal is so agitating to the central
[2795.68 - 2799.36] nervous system into the vagus nerves but
[2797.60 - 2801.36] this person would never know this but
[2799.36 - 2802.96] this person's post garnered a lot of
[2801.36 - 2804.40] attention
[2802.96 - 2805.84] and there's so many people turned off
[2804.40 - 2808.80] the medical medium information that
[2805.84 - 2808.80] could save their lives
[2809.68 - 2814.32] and i'm not thinking about my livelihood
[2812.32 - 2816.32] because i tell everybody
[2814.32 - 2817.84] get it at the library for free i don't
[2816.32 - 2819.92] care if i can't turn the lights on
[2817.84 - 2822.80] anymore
[2819.92 - 2824.32] get it in the library for free
[2822.80 - 2826.00] but here's what's funny the person that
[2824.32 - 2827.92] put this post out and the first be other
[2826.00 - 2829.84] people too they start investing in other
[2827.92 - 2832.96] stuff you start becoming part of that
[2829.84 - 2834.16] whole mlm pyramid stuff and
[2832.96 - 2835.12] and
[2834.16 - 2837.60] you know
[2835.12 - 2839.28] whatever ambassador stuff and they got
[2837.60 - 2841.12] their own plans
[2839.28 - 2842.88] of why they're doing what they're doing
[2841.12 - 2845.44] evil intentions
[2842.88 - 2848.16] keeps a mark on your soul you do
[2845.44 - 2850.40] something terrible for a reason it stays
[2848.16 - 2852.24] in the soul whether you know it or not
[2850.40 - 2856.24] and it lives there
[2852.24 - 2856.24] and we have to contend with it someday
[2856.56 - 2859.52] let's go a little bit more oh here's a
[2858.08 - 2860.80] good one now let's go into this real
[2859.52 - 2862.72] quick
[2860.80 - 2863.60] all right
[2862.72 - 2865.92] right
[2863.60 - 2868.64] he states that blood draws
[2865.92 - 2871.04] are blood or bloodletting
[2868.64 - 2873.68] vampirism he states that blood draws are
[2871.04 - 2876.96] blood letting and vampirism this is
[2873.68 - 2877.68] dangerously false as blood work can give
[2876.96 - 2880.24] us
[2877.68 - 2882.24] essential information when did dr faun
[2880.24 - 2885.20] good good to see you dr fun did i ever
[2882.24 - 2887.28] said to people never to get blood work
[2885.20 - 2888.56] did i ever dr font
[2887.28 - 2890.32] md
[2888.56 - 2892.08] did i ever in
[2890.32 - 2893.44] all the decades of doing this and
[2892.08 - 2895.68] anywhere else in my book should i ever
[2893.44 - 2897.36] tell somebody never to get a blood test
[2895.68 - 2899.20] to ever say that it's not helpful in any
[2897.36 - 2901.12] way
[2899.20 - 2902.56] what i've said is the same thing i've
[2901.12 - 2904.64] always said
[2902.56 - 2906.80] you get too much blood drawn when you're
[2904.64 - 2908.32] pregnant you damage the baby when you
[2906.80 - 2910.56] get too much blood drawn when you have
[2908.32 - 2912.72] neurological lyme it can send you
[2910.56 - 2915.04] backwards for months you get too much
[2912.72 - 2916.72] blood drawn when you're chronically ill
[2915.04 - 2919.04] and you can remove a part of your immune
[2916.72 - 2921.04] system and not bounce back i said
[2919.04 - 2922.96] there's a way to do it you have to learn
[2921.04 - 2924.80] how to do it
[2922.96 - 2926.32] you can ask your doctor for blood work
[2924.80 - 2929.84] and learn how to protect yourself
[2926.32 - 2929.84] medical medium information
[2930.00 - 2934.00] is about protecting yourself
[2932.32 - 2936.08] you can listen to the podcast the blood
[2934.00 - 2937.60] draw podcast so you know how to protect
[2936.08 - 2938.80] yourself
[2937.60 - 2940.88] too much
[2938.80 - 2943.84] amigo 500 says too much damages the
[2940.88 - 2943.84] immune system
[2944.80 - 2949.12] tear appleman says no complete
[2946.32 - 2951.04] misunderstanding twisting your words
[2949.12 - 2953.68] exactly
[2951.04 - 2953.68] exactly
[2954.48 - 2959.84] so important to know dr fond he said to
[2957.44 - 2961.60] avoid taking too much
[2959.84 - 2963.36] but this person has scared a lot of
[2961.60 - 2965.20] people with this one because all of a
[2963.36 - 2966.56] sudden i look like a guy
[2965.20 - 2969.36] that never wants you to go to your
[2966.56 - 2971.36] doctor and get blood work that's insane
[2969.36 - 2973.44] definitely get your blood work
[2971.36 - 2976.64] but i always recommend doing what i
[2973.44 - 2978.40] recommend friends to do
[2976.64 - 2980.08] is you ask for half files or quarter
[2978.40 - 2981.52] miles
[2980.08 - 2982.80] and you'd be cautious to how much is
[2981.52 - 2984.96] being drawn when you're really
[2982.80 - 2987.36] chronically ill because i don't want you
[2984.96 - 2988.72] to have to go backwards and backwards
[2987.36 - 2991.52] and backwards and then you think your
[2988.72 - 2994.24] celery juice made you sick
[2991.52 - 2995.76] michelle l details matter
[2994.24 - 2998.32] so i'm gonna read a couple more if you
[2995.76 - 2999.20] guys don't mind right here's one right
[2998.32 - 3001.12] here
[2999.20 - 3003.52] this is a good one
[3001.12 - 3004.72] eggs are not the unhealthy
[3003.52 - 3007.68] everyone
[3004.72 - 3009.20] is bio-individual so eggs are not the
[3007.68 - 3011.44] unhealthy
[3009.20 - 3014.24] everyone is bio-individual
[3011.44 - 3016.40] creating food fear is dangerous
[3014.24 - 3018.80] okay
[3016.40 - 3019.76] you know why everybody
[3018.80 - 3021.36] who
[3019.76 - 3023.20] has been there and done that out there
[3021.36 - 3024.88] loves medical medium information because
[3023.20 - 3027.52] it allowed them to eat fruit for the
[3024.88 - 3029.92] first time in their
[3027.52 - 3031.92] sick chronically ill lives
[3029.92 - 3034.56] medical medium information opens the
[3031.92 - 3036.40] floodgate to all the herbs it opens the
[3034.56 - 3038.08] floodgate to all the leafy greens it
[3036.40 - 3040.72] opens the floodgate to every vegetable
[3038.08 - 3042.48] it opens the floodgate to all the fruit
[3040.72 - 3044.56] it opens the floodgate if you want to
[3042.48 - 3046.16] still eat animal protein okay it opens
[3044.56 - 3048.48] the floodgate if you want to do even
[3046.16 - 3050.24] some grains and oats medical medium
[3048.48 - 3053.36] information is not about
[3050.24 - 3054.96] food fear or fruit fear
[3053.36 - 3056.96] it's about making sure that if you're
[3054.96 - 3059.92] chronically ill that you stand a chance
[3056.96 - 3061.76] you can actually heal and recover
[3059.92 - 3063.52] and if you know what to avoid when
[3061.76 - 3066.00] you're really sick yeah i got friends
[3063.52 - 3069.28] that eat eggs
[3066.00 - 3070.88] i don't say anything because they're not
[3069.28 - 3072.40] sick
[3070.88 - 3074.32] you're sick
[3072.40 - 3075.44] you got a problem
[3074.32 - 3077.04] you're going to get in trouble so i want
[3075.44 - 3078.80] to talk about something you guys i want
[3077.04 - 3080.56] to actually drop something on you guys
[3078.80 - 3082.00] that's important right now a few of the
[3080.56 - 3083.68] haters that were in the medical medium
[3082.00 - 3085.12] community that got their lives back that
[3083.68 - 3086.56] posted about how they got their lives
[3085.12 - 3087.92] back for years
[3086.56 - 3089.68] healed used all the medical meat
[3087.92 - 3091.76] information drank their 32 ounces of
[3089.68 - 3092.72] celery juice did their heavy metal detox
[3091.76 - 3094.32] smoothies
[3092.72 - 3095.60] avoided eggs and everything they got
[3094.32 - 3098.00] their lives back and then they left the
[3095.60 - 3099.44] community and they got mad at me
[3098.00 - 3101.28] i don't know why
[3099.44 - 3103.20] but they got mad at me and left the
[3101.28 - 3105.36] community and then started up their
[3103.20 - 3107.12] alkaline ionizer water machines oh
[3105.36 - 3108.88] that's why i forget
[3107.12 - 3111.92] they started their other stuff they
[3108.88 - 3114.00] wanted to do and then as time went on
[3111.92 - 3116.72] they started doing things like eggs and
[3114.00 - 3118.40] things like that again and then they got
[3116.72 - 3121.44] sick again
[3118.40 - 3121.44] they got sick again
[3121.68 - 3124.88] because
[3122.80 - 3126.88] they healed because they avoided eggs
[3124.88 - 3128.40] because they had a pathogen
[3126.88 - 3130.88] and then they started tanking the eggs
[3128.40 - 3132.64] like eating a lot of eggs
[3130.88 - 3134.40] and then they started to digress in
[3132.64 - 3136.40] their healing because they were making
[3134.40 - 3139.12] themselves sick again and they started
[3136.40 - 3140.88] developing symptoms a lot of people go
[3139.12 - 3143.04] through that process but they never
[3140.88 - 3145.36] correct anything they never say okay i'm
[3143.04 - 3147.12] gonna do a post and say you guys i had
[3145.36 - 3149.04] the best four years of my life i could
[3147.12 - 3150.88] run five miles now i could run and jog
[3149.04 - 3153.12] 10 miles i can do all these things i'm
[3150.88 - 3154.56] happy my kids are happy i'm better no
[3153.12 - 3156.56] one has to worry about mommy dying
[3154.56 - 3159.52] anymore being sick i got my life back
[3156.56 - 3161.92] and then i diversed i tapped the guy i
[3159.52 - 3164.00] ate all these bad foods that then i got
[3161.92 - 3166.24] sick again but but here i'm gonna tell
[3164.00 - 3167.60] you guys what happened he was right he
[3166.24 - 3170.00] was right
[3167.60 - 3171.52] and and and here all i have to do is
[3170.00 - 3173.84] clean things up a little bit and get my
[3171.52 - 3175.68] life back no one corrects anything no
[3173.84 - 3179.68] one fixes anything
[3175.68 - 3182.80] i don't know if it's pride or it's ego
[3179.68 - 3183.84] samantha says they will twist and mold
[3182.80 - 3185.84] all
[3183.84 - 3187.76] what you said to suit their own agenda
[3185.84 - 3189.92] absolutely
[3187.76 - 3192.48] so here's another one right here
[3189.92 - 3195.60] there is no scientific evidence for
[3192.48 - 3199.52] cluster salts in celery juice however
[3195.60 - 3203.52] ever celery juice can help some people
[3199.52 - 3206.08] science hasn't studied celery juice yet
[3203.52 - 3208.72] this person doesn't know this yet but
[3206.08 - 3210.88] science has not studied celery juice yet
[3208.72 - 3212.64] i have been waiting forever and when
[3210.88 - 3214.00] they do study it they will find the
[3212.64 - 3216.64] things in there and then they'll talk
[3214.00 - 3220.16] about it just like harvard and other
[3216.64 - 3221.76] places studied epstein-barr recently and
[3220.16 - 3223.12] found out that medical media was right
[3221.76 - 3225.04] that epstein-barr is the cause of
[3223.12 - 3226.40] multiple sclerosis and now seven years
[3225.04 - 3228.40] later
[3226.40 - 3229.84] after i published it
[3228.40 - 3232.32] they're doing
[3229.84 - 3234.24] papers on there now right well the same
[3232.32 - 3236.24] thing's gonna happen with celery juice
[3234.24 - 3238.32] give it time and when you're 20 years
[3236.24 - 3240.16] old or 22 years old or whatever you are
[3238.32 - 3241.60] yeah seven years from now and 10 years
[3240.16 - 3243.04] from now you'll see that celery juice
[3241.60 - 3245.28] has special things in it and guess what
[3243.04 - 3248.16] you'll never fix this you'll never say
[3245.28 - 3251.28] you guys i did a post seven years ago on
[3248.16 - 3253.12] my ig and i did that post and i i ripped
[3251.28 - 3254.88] this guy apart and i made people not
[3253.12 - 3257.04] drink celery juice anymore i made them
[3254.88 - 3258.96] doubt celery juice but i'm not gonna fix
[3257.04 - 3260.72] it you guys i'm not gonna go back and
[3258.96 - 3262.56] fix it and tell everybody i was wrong
[3260.72 - 3264.80] medical medium was right
[3262.56 - 3267.60] and that this whole time science finally
[3264.80 - 3269.28] did discover it because i had people say
[3267.60 - 3270.80] bad things about medical media when i
[3269.28 - 3273.44] said multiple cirrhosis multiple
[3270.80 - 3275.28] sclerosis was caused by epstein barr and
[3273.44 - 3276.56] people ripped me apart you guys
[3275.28 - 3278.56] including people in the science
[3276.56 - 3281.28] community they ripped medical medium
[3278.56 - 3284.00] apart years ago because i stood up and
[3281.28 - 3287.84] said epstein-barr causes ms but guess
[3284.00 - 3289.84] what now that they discovered it is true
[3287.84 - 3291.52] no one's coming back and correcting it
[3289.84 - 3292.40] no one's putting articles out and saying
[3291.52 - 3295.20] oh my god
[3292.40 - 3296.96] we ripped apart aw seven years ago and
[3295.20 - 3298.24] and we wrote these bad articles about
[3296.96 - 3300.64] him and we said all these terrible
[3298.24 - 3302.88] things but look he was right he he
[3300.64 - 3305.36] actually does hear he is a prophet he
[3302.88 - 3307.36] does hear from from spirit of compassion
[3305.36 - 3309.20] and we're not gonna correct it we're not
[3307.36 - 3311.68] gonna say he was right
[3309.20 - 3314.40] that's how evil works
[3311.68 - 3316.08] it's part of how evil works and
[3314.40 - 3317.76] it's in your soul
[3316.08 - 3320.16] the people who do this
[3317.76 - 3322.16] they keep that in their soul that they
[3320.16 - 3324.24] had intentions that are that dark what
[3322.16 - 3325.92] does that say that says when you leave
[3324.24 - 3328.32] this place no matter what happens you
[3325.92 - 3331.44] take that with you and your soul just
[3328.32 - 3333.76] floats around out of here as you leave
[3331.44 - 3337.04] and it harbors all that ill intent and
[3333.76 - 3337.76] all that corrosive attempt intent and
[3337.04 - 3340.56] and
[3337.76 - 3342.72] and all of it and malice and just
[3340.56 - 3344.88] everything and it holds on to it and
[3342.72 - 3346.88] that's what you have to have in the end
[3344.88 - 3349.84] this for being like that's what these
[3346.88 - 3349.84] people have
[3350.24 - 3355.76] here's one right here
[3353.20 - 3358.00] gut infections and pathogens can still
[3355.76 - 3359.60] feed on fruits veggies starches etc
[3358.00 - 3362.80] despite what he claims
[3359.60 - 3365.12] no one knew a pathogen fed it's medical
[3362.80 - 3367.12] medium information
[3365.12 - 3368.40] she's actually taking medical medium
[3367.12 - 3372.16] information
[3368.40 - 3372.16] and throwing it back at me
[3372.32 - 3376.08] i'm confused wait a minute
[3374.56 - 3379.12] science of research didn't know that
[3376.08 - 3382.32] pathogens ate anything
[3379.12 - 3384.16] this is it doesn't exist
[3382.32 - 3386.32] i've been talking about it for 35 years
[3384.16 - 3388.32] the pathogens eat food but everybody
[3386.32 - 3390.72] laughed at it
[3388.32 - 3391.92] science doesn't believe that a virus
[3390.72 - 3394.56] eats
[3391.92 - 3396.64] but here this person throws medical
[3394.56 - 3398.32] medium information published in medical
[3396.64 - 3400.32] media books and and talked about in
[3398.32 - 3402.32] lectures for years throws it back at me
[3400.32 - 3404.00] and says gut infections and pathogens
[3402.32 - 3406.72] can still feed on fruits veggies and
[3404.00 - 3408.56] starches that's funny because pathogens
[3406.72 - 3409.84] don't feed on anything says all the
[3408.56 - 3411.60] science in the world including
[3409.84 - 3412.96] alternative science
[3411.60 - 3415.76] this person took
[3412.96 - 3417.68] mm info that's unique and put it in here
[3415.76 - 3420.16] as if it was known and threw it back at
[3417.68 - 3422.48] me as if i don't do it
[3420.16 - 3425.44] this can act this is actually like
[3422.48 - 3425.44] twilight zone
[3425.68 - 3429.60] let's take a look at another one a
[3427.12 - 3431.92] strict vegan diet can cause blood sugar
[3429.60 - 3432.88] imbalances and gut dysbiosis for certain
[3431.92 - 3434.16] people
[3432.88 - 3436.08] who said
[3434.16 - 3437.84] and by the way it's damaging false
[3436.08 - 3438.88] information this person's putting out
[3437.84 - 3440.80] there
[3438.88 - 3443.92] defamation
[3440.80 - 3445.04] and damaging false in information by the
[3443.92 - 3447.04] way
[3445.04 - 3448.72] thank god
[3447.04 - 3450.96] i'm not like somebody else some of these
[3448.72 - 3452.24] other people did you know if you say one
[3450.96 - 3454.48] little
[3452.24 - 3457.36] bad word did you guys know this you say
[3454.48 - 3459.04] one little bad word about doctor
[3457.36 - 3461.92] and doctor
[3459.04 - 3463.52] and doctor in a podcast and doctor
[3461.92 - 3466.56] you guys know the doctors i don't have
[3463.52 - 3468.48] to say their name you say one bad word
[3466.56 - 3470.72] you're just somebody on a post that you
[3468.48 - 3473.36] just don't all of a sudden like dr john
[3470.72 - 3474.88] and you'd often don't like dr gunner
[3473.36 - 3476.00] and you say one little thing in your
[3474.88 - 3479.20] post
[3476.00 - 3480.48] do you know how fried you would be
[3479.20 - 3481.84] your whole account would probably come
[3480.48 - 3485.76] down
[3481.84 - 3488.16] but did you know that i i don't do that
[3485.76 - 3490.00] i let people speak their stuff and say
[3488.16 - 3492.32] their stuff and put it out there and
[3490.00 - 3494.48] defame me and put all this
[3492.32 - 3496.48] this wrong information
[3494.48 - 3498.80] and i let them do that
[3496.48 - 3500.72] because i believe in like freedom
[3498.80 - 3502.56] i let them do that
[3500.72 - 3505.60] but all the podcast doctors would come
[3502.56 - 3507.28] down on this person tomorrow
[3505.60 - 3509.76] and they'd be in some serious trouble
[3507.28 - 3511.68] you'd see some pr marketing people you'd
[3509.76 - 3513.20] see some publicist you see some people
[3511.68 - 3515.36] coming down on these people and oh my
[3513.20 - 3517.84] god would they get served a whole bunch
[3515.36 - 3519.52] of stuff
[3517.84 - 3521.12] so this person's take advantage of
[3519.52 - 3523.68] taking advantage of medical medium
[3521.12 - 3523.68] kindness
[3525.36 - 3529.20] sick
[3527.12 - 3530.88] here's something a strict vegan diet can
[3529.20 - 3532.64] cause blood sugar imbalances and gut
[3530.88 - 3534.32] dysbiosis for certain people strict
[3532.64 - 3536.00] vegan diet
[3534.32 - 3537.44] i sit here until i'm blue on the face
[3536.00 - 3540.48] and tell people you can heal if you're
[3537.44 - 3540.48] eating animal protein
[3541.60 - 3544.40] you can heal when you're plant-based you
[3543.12 - 3546.40] can heal if you're vegan
[3544.40 - 3548.72] but you gotta look you gotta look out
[3546.40 - 3550.16] for that nutritional yeast whatever you
[3548.72 - 3551.92] are you gotta look out for that vinegar
[3550.16 - 3553.36] and you gotta look out for that caffeine
[3551.92 - 3554.88] because that could be the bridge that
[3553.36 - 3558.08] stops you from healing the bridge that
[3554.88 - 3559.84] breaks and stops you from healing
[3558.08 - 3561.44] i told you the vegan people have hated
[3559.84 - 3562.56] me for years yes there's vegans in the
[3561.44 - 3563.84] medical meeting community just like
[3562.56 - 3565.28] there's animal protein people in the
[3563.84 - 3567.52] medical media community the vegan people
[3565.28 - 3569.68] have hated me for years the vegan people
[3567.52 - 3572.24] because they don't think i support
[3569.68 - 3573.60] veganism and they hate me for it this
[3572.24 - 3575.12] person's acting like i'm one of the
[3573.60 - 3578.16] vegan like
[3575.12 - 3578.16] parades out there
[3578.96 - 3583.36] dysbiosis no one knows what's supposed
[3581.12 - 3586.80] to be in the gut by the way
[3583.36 - 3589.84] who who like no one has an exact um
[3586.80 - 3591.60] there's no exact science to dysbiosis
[3589.84 - 3595.36] so here's somebody that's just
[3591.60 - 3595.36] throwing out whatever okay
[3595.60 - 3600.32] here's one right here he states that
[3597.76 - 3602.56] there should not be fruit fear yet
[3600.32 - 3606.20] creates fear around
[3602.56 - 3606.20] other food groups
[3623.84 - 3628.88] where's my coffee
[3626.40 - 3631.20] where's my espresso
[3628.88 - 3634.80] where's my bars of chocolate
[3631.20 - 3637.28] because i want to caffeine my baby
[3634.80 - 3638.64] so my my baby has an addiction now to
[3637.28 - 3640.24] caffeine it goes through shakes and
[3638.64 - 3642.96] withdrawal inside my woman i don't even
[3640.24 - 3645.12] know it i educate people
[3642.96 - 3647.04] on how to protect so you can protect
[3645.12 - 3648.80] your second baby and your third baby and
[3647.04 - 3650.72] your fourth baby
[3648.80 - 3654.08] so they don't become heroin addicts when
[3650.72 - 3655.44] they're 15 years old and 18 years old
[3654.08 - 3658.96] and they don't become junkies when
[3655.44 - 3662.08] they're 21 years old and ruin your life
[3658.96 - 3664.80] i educate people so i can protect moms
[3662.08 - 3667.68] and babies and children i educate people
[3664.80 - 3671.48] about food groups like caffeine
[3667.68 - 3671.48] and other food groups
[3675.92 - 3678.40] and so
[3680.56 - 3685.52] anyway it goes on and on and on
[3683.36 - 3687.04] and there's plenty to be had too
[3685.52 - 3688.64] so
[3687.04 - 3691.60] but i'm going to talk about this again i
[3688.64 - 3693.36] think i'm going to go to ig
[3691.60 - 3696.00] i'll go to ig i'm going to put tick-tock
[3693.36 - 3697.84] back on too right
[3696.00 - 3700.96] ignoring them is best
[3697.84 - 3703.84] their time and andy says i i understand
[3700.96 - 3704.96] that like honestly ignoring them is best
[3703.84 - 3705.92] right
[3704.96 - 3707.76] true
[3705.92 - 3709.44] but when you watch a lot of people that
[3707.76 - 3710.40] get hurt
[3709.44 - 3713.04] and they
[3710.40 - 3714.48] they'll never actually find their way
[3713.04 - 3716.00] when they get really sick like
[3714.48 - 3717.76] chronically ill because they'll always
[3716.00 - 3719.68] be poisoned there'll be something inside
[3717.76 - 3721.04] of them that says no i don't know where
[3719.68 - 3724.96] i heard it
[3721.04 - 3724.96] but i heard he just he's bad
[3725.28 - 3729.20] and it's sad
[3727.20 - 3730.96] i'm a fighter i'm a fighter for the
[3729.20 - 3733.44] chronicle
[3730.96 - 3735.68] not a fighter for myself
[3733.44 - 3737.52] if i was a fighter for myself i would do
[3735.68 - 3739.68] other things i guess
[3737.52 - 3741.12] i'm a fighter for the chronicle
[3739.68 - 3743.44] and that's what i do
[3741.12 - 3745.52] and that's what gets me
[3743.44 - 3747.92] helene says you don't create fear that's
[3745.52 - 3749.84] nonsense you educate with the truth on
[3747.92 - 3751.52] what is real food
[3749.84 - 3753.04] and what is nutrition thank you for
[3751.52 - 3754.88] being here helene
[3753.04 - 3756.24] you guys we're gonna go i'm glad we
[3754.88 - 3757.52] covered a lot of different topics we

[3757.52 - 3760.88] talked about this fun stuff we talked
[3759.20 - 3763.92] about all of it

[3765.60 - 3769.28] knows what's gonna happen all right
