and everything else but

40
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,439
bugs bugs have similar jobs their

41
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,640
similar jobs

42
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:26,400
is like bugs similar jobs is to

43
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:29,439
feed off of food so

44
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,360
bugs love food so bacteria whether it's

45
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:33,200
super bacteria

46
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,040
they love food so always they always

47
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,600
realize they have to be eating something

48
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,640
they like

49
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,479
something that we have inside of us so

50
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,680
a lot of doctors talk to me about mrsa

51
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,799
it's something that comes up all the

52
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,439
time

53
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,840
and what i tell doctors is um because

54
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,680
because

55
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,439
you guys know i tell you this is i talk

56
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,880
to a good two or three doctors a day

57
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,479
every single day

58
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,759
and they reach out they want to know

59
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,439
information so they can help their

60
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,159
patients out there in the world

61
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,040
and um and what i've always asked about

62
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,560
mercy like

63
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,159
what do you you know what's your take on

64
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,520
mercy and my take is

65
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,640
getting foods out of you out of your

66
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,599
diet that actually

67
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,840
feed mrs that's one that's one edge you

68
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:14,080
can try to get and i tell doctors so

69
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,440
eggs you don't want to eat eggs because

70
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,959
eggs were

71
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:21,920
used to raise mrsa

72
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,360
originally so mrsa wasn't this thing

73
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,800
that just appeared

74
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,480
like it appeared mrsa was in a lab

75
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,480
along with all the other bugs a long

76
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:34,319
time ago and somehow

77
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:36,800
got out somehow escaped i don't know how

78
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:38,160
but they did you know you can think of a

79
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,720
lot of different ways they could have

80
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,120
done it

81
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,400
but it escaped and got on the scene and

82
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,239
how was it raised it was

83
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:48,400
raised in labs eating eggs so using eggs

84
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:51,040
as the food so you got to remember that

85
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,319
so if you're you know somebody that has

86
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,680
that and you're dealing with that no

87
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,480
eggs look out for that look out for

88
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,120
gluten

89
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,159
look out for different you know for um

90
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,280
milk cheese and butter

91
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:01,120
don't do anything like that that's

92
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,000
really important to know and then it's

93
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,000
about like

94
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,200
if i had mrsa i'd want to make sure i

95
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,040
had the right zinc

96
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,280
because that's incredible for any kind

97
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,400
of bug issue like in that or anything

98
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,840
you know and i'll make sure i got the

99
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,599
right zinc i make sure i know the right

100
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,120
tools make sure i'm drinking my

101
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:17,040
celery juice and someone might say oh

102
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,879
he's saying celery just fixes everything

103
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,720
no it's not it it's

104
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,920
celery juice is really supportive for

105
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,720
the immune system

106
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,720
it also is anti-bug so it's all about

107
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,879
how many tools can you bring in

108
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,040
can you get rid of the eggs can you you

109
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,480
know can you um

110
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,560
you know it's all important you know

111
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,239
it's all about that plus uh celery juice

112
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,440
is bioavailable vitamin c it doesn't

113
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,599
have to be converted

114
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,200
so like the celery juice right here that

115
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,519
doesn't have to be converted to vitamin

116
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,239
c

117
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,159
every single vitamin c you take and do

118
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,560
has to be converted by your liver

119
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:50,080
and celery juice is the only celery has

120
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,840
the only vitamin c that doesn't have to

121
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,599
be converted so it's all these little

122
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,640
tools that count

123
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:58,159
um so that when you're somewhere if

124
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,599
you're visiting somebody in a hospital

125
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,239
or whatever it is you end up getting

126
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,560
mrsa

127
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,599
or you could you can get it in a public

128
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,720
bathroom

129
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:08,720
and now you have mrsa and it's like

130
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,159
yeah it's like what what kind of

131
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,319
environment are you

132
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,280
giving mrsa like what kind of

133
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,680
environment is it

134
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,320
allowed to take advantage of so it's all

135
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,919
about

136
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,199
the tools it's all about the zinc it's

137
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:21,120
all about making sure you're not eating

138
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,600
eggs it's all about keeping your fats

139
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,320
low

140
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,919
if your fats are too high then your

141
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,440
immune system is going to struggle if

142
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,960
your blood fat's high all the time

143
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,520
you're eating too much

144
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,960
avocado nuts and seeds you know almond

145
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,479
butter peanut butter

146
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:38,080
chicken meat fish whatever it is oils

147
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,360
you know whatever you're doing if you're

148
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,120
eating too much of that you're not

149
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,199
eating enough leafy greens

150
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,199
leafy greens are critical if you're not

151
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:47,520
doing you know enough of that wild foods

152
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,960
are you doing any well foods and so

153
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,040
it's all this stuff medical medium

154
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,240
information has all that information so

155
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:57,840
and talks about that it's what it's

156
00:04:52,240 --> 00:05:02,479
always been so yeah

157
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:04,800
so um delores super low b12

158
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:06,240
getting weekly shots what can i do to

159
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,400
naturally increase now what i tell

160
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,919
doctors all the time i get asked that

161
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,919
doctors contact me and say i heard

162
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:13,600
anthony you don't like the b12 shots

163
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:15,199
the doctors will ask me that i don't

164
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,720
like the b12 shots

165
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:20,560
um and i i like it orally

166
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,320
so that's what i like using the b12 it

167
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,479
has to be oral b12

168
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,000
i mean my my whole opinion from what i

169
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,880
get from spirit of compassion teaching

170
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,479
me so then i've

171
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,400
i'm obviously going with spirit of

172
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:34,000
compassion's information so

173
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:37,440
and i tell doctors to be 12 shots

174
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:41,280
is that is it a shot is an actual shot

175
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:43,680
versus in uh inter intravenous

176
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,360
vitamin so that's different i mean you

177
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,039
know i'm pro-intravenous vitamins and

178
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,160
for some things and for some reasons and

179
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:51,520
for some cases

180
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,080
so i'm pro that but b12 shots i'm not

181
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,080
pro

182
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,440
so i'm not i'm never happy about b12

183
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,199
shots so um

184
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,039
you go to your doctor ask him say hey

185
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,759
what about an oral b12

186
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,880
i feel that when it goes or not feel i

187
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,280
mean i've known through spirit of

188
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,039
compassion and then i've seen it work

189
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,400
when it goes through the digestive tract

190
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:10,560
so when it goes into the mouth through

191
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,400
the digestive tract it hits the ilium

192
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,319
the ilium is where you produce your own

193
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,840
b12 when it hits the ilium you're

194
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,759
producing your own b12 there

195
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,600
when you get a b12 shot it doesn't hit

196
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,080
the helium and you want the b12

197
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,680
eventually

198
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,520
going down to the helium where you

199
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,560
produce your own b12 and then it pulls

200
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,880
up into the liver

201
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,479
so when you take an oral b12 supplement

202
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,840
it goes to this natural process

203
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:31,919
it goes down to the ilium where you

204
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,479
create b12 then it gets sucked up to the

205
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:36,960
hepatoportal highway up into the liver

206
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:38,479
and then the liver then converts it

207
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,840
converts it better

208
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:42,160
and when it converts it better it

209
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,479
baptizes it sends it back out and that

210
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,840
makes the b12 really work so

211
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:50,479
um and if you're plant-based you're not

212
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,319
b12 deficient because you're plant-based

213
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,759
uh animal will be animal based people

214
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,199
they're all b12 deficient

215
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,720
just millions and millions of them

216
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:01,280
millions so really important to know

217
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,039
so but having a combination of adenosil

218
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,360
cobalamin methocil cabal

219
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:06,720
methylcobalamin adenosicobalam and it's

220
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,360
really important you can check out my

you'll find out the true cause of your

260
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:28,319
eczema finding out the true cause of

261
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:29,039
your ex is critical that's a that's a

262
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,800
big

00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:33,039
piece right there and what you'll find

264
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,640
in the book unique information you can't

265
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,159
find anywhere that's the one thing about

266
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,080
the medical medium information it's all

267
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,479
unique and original everything else is

268
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,839
not

269
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,360
so everything else floating around has

270
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,959
been the same old for decade after

271
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,920
decade with nobody getting better

272
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:47,440
unless they take tidbits of original

273
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,120
medical medium information

274
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,560
and they do and they don't cite it back

275
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,480
like a lot of different people all

276
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,160
through the years 35 years of this

277
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,920
have not cited it backs and then someone

278
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:59,040
thinks it came from somewhere else

279
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,839
um but what you'll find is copper inside

280
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,839
the liver

281
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:06,399
plus ebv equals eczema weeping eczema

282
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:07,200
for sure all of it so you need a virus

283
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,720
inside the liver

284
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,560
and i teach doctors this all the time

285
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,800
the virus inside the liver ebv

286
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,000
it feeds off of copper releases a

287
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,560
dermatoxin

288
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,839
it craps out copper the virus actually

289
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,440
craps out copper

290
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:20,959
when it releases it goes to the bathroom

291
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,120
and that copper comes out

292
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:24,560
that becomes this dermatoxin and that

293
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,000
floats around through the body and it

294
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,839
surfaces through the skin because the

295
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,839
liver is stagnant and sluggish

296
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,880
and when that happens you end up getting

297
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,800
your eczema so

298
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,320
you'll learn here like what do i do

299
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,320
you'll find out the true cause

300
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,080
what do i do what kind of options do i

301
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,360
have take this to your doctor ask him

302
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,480
about it

303
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,080
you can customize your own protocol to

304
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,760
get you in the direction of

305
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,519
of healing that's the whole point you

306
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,360
can actually customize

307
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,040
your own personal protocol with medical

308
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,160
media information you can take it as far

309
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,680
as you want to go

310
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,120
thousands and thousands and thousands of

311
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,399
people are healing their eczema

312
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,000
psoriasis

313
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,519
i hope i helped in any information

314
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,279
tidbits i can give you on that

315
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,959
the mold is a trigger to lower the

316
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,560
immune system and then yeah anything

317
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,880
else can get worse

318
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,079
but what you want to do is take care of

319
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,680
the what's getting worse the problem

320
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:12,160
like the eczema get working on that and

321
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,160
so forth

322
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,920
so rachel says

323
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:22,959
gestational diabetes how do you treat it

324
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:24,000
so only seven weeks old you know what

325
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:27,760
happens is with

326
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:30,160
with um with that and diabetes is that

327
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,880
you know first of all what i've always

328
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,079
told in a

329
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:35,519
um like doctors and and and

330
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,519
other people have known throughout the

331
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,360
years is you you

332
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,680
definitely get when it comes down to

333
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,720
gestational diabetes

334
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:46,000
ask around get second opinions get a

335
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,000
third opinion

336
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,920
get a fourth opinion and what you'll

337
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,200
find is when you're getting different

338
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,399
opinions you'll find that

339
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,240
another doctor is going to be a lot

340
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,440
helpful with that more helpful with that

341
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,399
than another doctor that's what i've

342
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,079
always known there's

343
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,920
that that's where i would start is did

344
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,519
you get a second third fourth opinion

345
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,360
because when it comes down to that so

346
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:05,360
important to get a consensus

347
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,959
between doctors and are they talking to

348
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,240
each other too like are the doctors

349
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,920
talking to each other if you find they

350
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,399
won't talk to each other

351
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,839
and and you and that that that's really

352
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,160
hard and i noticed that

353
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:17,680
you know getting extra support because

354
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,040
when doctors start talking to each other

355
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:22,560
so then they can try to figure out a

356
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,560
game plan and how to address it

357
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:29,839
so

358
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:39,040

you know what a lot of times you'll hear

362
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,240
you know one of the what the whole thing

363
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,839

thing you want to do is you want to know

385
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,639

386
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,079
the library

387
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,680
don't even buy the book go to the

388
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:51,279

389
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,040
okay so then you can get the book and

390
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:56,079
you can look at it and you can see

391
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:58,320
like the cause of ra and you it's

392
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:59,279
you can go to the autoimmune because ra

393
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,120
is

394
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,560
called autoimmune that's what the

395
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,160
research and science calls it it's what

396
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,560
doctors will call it it's autoimmune

397
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:08,000
so if you go in here you'll find it

398
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,160
either in the autoimmune section

399
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,600
that will just be anything that's not

400
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,200
listed in here that's autoimmune you go

401
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,160
into the autoimmune section

402
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,160
unless you find it

403
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,639
sandra says you never answer questions

404
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,360
you just say

405
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:26,560
buy my book okay good question well

406
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,399
don't buy the book

407
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,079
get it free at the library that's number

408
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,079
one so

409
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:33,920
another thing too is i'm not just trying

410
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:35,680
to sell a book if i wanted to do that i

411
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,839
would sell programs

412
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,199
and get rich you know by selling

413
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,680
programs for five thousand dollars

414
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,880
apiece

415
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,639
twenty five hundred dollars a piece

416
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,720
three thousand dollars a piece thousands

417
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:47,360
of people would buy into the programs

418
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,079
i can do courses and classes i don't and

419
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,839
um

420
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:51,839
it would be unbelievable really what

421
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:53,760
would happen so i don't do that choose

422
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,920
not to do that it's my publisher's book

423
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,680
they sell it out there sure i'm trying

424
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,920
to get the book out there too to help

425
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:02,160
people so people have a resource

426
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,360
but if i was all about just trying to

427
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,920
sell something

428
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,480
then i would be selling courses classes

429
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,800
and

430
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,639
um programs and selling them for

431
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,000
thousands upon thousands of dollars

432
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,279
i would break the book up so no one

433
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,800
would get the information and they would

434
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:16,240
have to pay for it but i want you to

435
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,839

436
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,000

accomplishment it really is it's so

466
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,880
helpful too for other people to know

467
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:31,279
that

468
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,800
you're doing your celery juice 16 ounces

469
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:36,800
that's wonderful

470
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:38,399
um okay so carrie can you talk about

471
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:41,680
bipolar

472
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:45,199
so i would love to um bipolar

473
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:47,360
is a diagnosis for

474
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:48,720
no one in medical research and science

475
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,040
or anywhere knowing

476
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,079
why how what the cause is what it is

477
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:55,680
okay so

478
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:56,639
it's a really silly name for a condition

479
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,880
that's really

480
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:00,399
hard to live with when someone you know

481
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,079
when you're suffering with it yourself

482
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,920
it's really hard and

483
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:05,839
so they they don't know what causes it

484
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:08,959
so they name it bipolar which means

485
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:10,560
north south up and down so all the

486
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:13,600
research and science we have

487
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:16,079
all the technology we have all of the

488
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,839
studies and peer review studies and all

489
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:20,480
of the stuff that we got going on

490
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:22,000
the best they can do is you're either up

491
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:25,440
or you're down that's what they tell

492
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,880
you it's sad i think bipolar is probably

493
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,519
quintessentially

494
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:31,279
an example of how screwed up the system

495
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:32,720
is and how screwed up the medical system

496
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:34,880
is and how screwed up research and

497
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,040
science it is because

498
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:39,120
they're better off just saying we don't

499
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:41,040
know why you're going through this we

500
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,040
don't know why you're suffering we don't

501
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,519
know why you're hurting so bad and

502
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,240
you're

503
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:47,440
you're emotional and you're you're in

504
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,680
agony and you're

505
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,600
in the depression and you're not feeling

506
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,000
good or you're manic and we don't know

507
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,120
why

508
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,800
all that's happening and so

509
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,240
i wish they would be honest and not not

510
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,959
be in denial but what they do

511
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,839
is they will name it something bipolar

512
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:04,720
which means

513
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:05,120
nothing it just means they think you're

514
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,919
either

515
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:09,839
up or you're down it's really sad toxic

516
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,839
heavy metals is the cause of

517
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:13,439
that term bipolar it's the cause of

518
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:14,880
somebody being all over the place like

519
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,160
that where they're hurting emotionally

520
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,079
and they're up and they're down and

521
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,439
they're all over the place and it's then

522
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:22,160
it's you know mercury

523
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:24,240
big part of it so that's mercury is the

524
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,839
issue behind that so that means

525
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,839
you can go you can go and get a mercury

526
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:29,520
test at the doctor you can go to your

527
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:31,840
doctor get a mercury test

528
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,880
um but it may not show up because

529
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:35,120
mercury

530
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,640
is inside organs and it gets inside our

531
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,919
brain and it gets in center of liver and

532
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:41,200
it gets inside our organs

533
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:41,679
and so they won't see that in a blood

534
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,559
test

535
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:45,039
because it's inside organs and organ

536
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:46,880
tissue

537
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:48,880
you can't test for that easily but you

538
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,840
can at least you can ask the doctor and

539
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,520
tell them look

540
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,880
i i think i got some heavy metals i

541
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,160
think i got some mercury

542
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,919
and you can you know you can learn

543
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,919
information on how to you can take

544
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,039
the cleanse of heal book to your doctor

545
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:01,840
talk to them about

546
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:03,280
you know toxic heavy metals i have a

547
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,960
heavy metal detox cleanse ask your

548
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:08,480
doctor if that works for you

549
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:10,400
and but the bottom line is it's really

550
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,640
sad when they don't have an answer

551
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,600
instead they kind of like basically say

552
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,919
something

553
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,679
they give it a ridiculous name i mean it

554
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:19,919
just doesn't make any sense

555
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,919
um but the heavy medical medium heavy

556
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:25,360
metal detox cleanse is important they

557
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:29,360
if they only would give it its real

558
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:30,880
the real thing like you got mercury and

559
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,280
you know mercury poisoning so that's

560
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,280
what it is

561
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,280
that's what i tell doctors all the time

562
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,760
so they know about it i just want to say

563
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,480
that

564
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,960
your frozen shoulder remedies are spot

565
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,000
on

566
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:46,160
so cheryl says that cured my husband

567
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,039
in a few weeks while others are having

568
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,799
surgeries

569
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:53,200
in mua et cetera and suffering for years

570
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:55,120
thank you well the frozen shoulder thing

571
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,600
is is the shingles

572
00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:00,240
and research in science doesn't know

573
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:02,880
that and so they look for

574
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,640
they look for um and they look for

575
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,120
tissue connective tissue that's messed

576
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:09,039
up they look for tears

577
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,320
they look for cartilage issues they look

578
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:11,679
for spurs

579
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,280
they look for all this by the way i'm

580
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,880
really proud of you i'm proud of your

581
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,960
husband really proud of you

582
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,039
cheryl they look for all this stuff and

583
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:22,240
then they put people under surgery and

584
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:23,760
i'm not anti-surgery i'm not anti uh i

585
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,120
mean i know surgeons i've talked to

586
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,480
surgeons there's times when we need it

587
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,080
there's times when we don't but what i

588
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,360
like to do with frozen shoulders i like

589
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:33,039
to go

590
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:35,440
this way which is you're inflamed

591
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:37,200
and we need to give it a chance to heal

592
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,360
before we jump into surgery

593
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,559
and so i'm proud of you and your husband

594
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,720
because you did

595
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:44,559
protocols you speci you did them

596
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,000
specifically for you you customized it

597
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,880
for you you knew how to use the

598
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,400
information

599
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,720
so that your husband could actually get

600
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:54,080
the inflammation down

601
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:56,080
with the information and get it down

602
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,360
and so that you can get the shingles

603
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,440
down because that's what it is the

604
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,760
protocol is designed for frozen shoulder

605
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,360
for

606
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:05,360
shingles so that somebody cannot be in

607
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,760
pain anymore with their shoulder

608
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,960
and and others yeah other people they

609
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,400
have to go get the surgery they don't

610
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,600
know about the protocol they don't know

611
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,960
about knocking down

612
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:16,080
the shingles they don't know about all

613
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,080
that so they don't know what to do

614
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,120
i'm really proud of you cheryl really

615
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:23,200
proud of you and your husband because

616
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,640
sounds to me like you read the book you

617
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,760
opened it you read it

618
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,760
and you're like you know what

619
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:32,000
a lot of people they just right now in

620
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,600
this day and age

621
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,520
some people are like i don't i want to

622
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,760
just find a video somewhere

623
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:41,520
and not read a book but it's important

624
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,520
to read it if the information's there

625
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,080
susan do you know anything about

626
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,240
orthostatic tremors

627
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,760
so and when it comes down to tremors

628
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,960
you're talking nervous system

629
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,159
so when you're talking about nervous

630
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,520
system you're talking about a couple of

631
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:55,360
things there

632
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:57,360
if you're if you went to your doctors if

633
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,640
you went to your um neurologist and they

634
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,640
did all their tests

635
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,240
they did their mris they did their cat

636
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,960
scans they did everything that they want

637
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,640
to do

638
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,320
and they can't find anything they can't

639
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,919
find a brain tumor they can't find

640
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,840
something else they can't find

641
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:11,360
and you're in this land of what do i do

642
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,679
and now it's under this label

643
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:15,280
or the static tremors and what do i do

644
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,080
and when you're in that zone then you

645
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,640
have to realize

646
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:20,240
well okay then you look at like cleanse

647
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,080
the heel you take it to your doctor

648
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,760
you look at cleanse the heel and you'll

649
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:26,480
be like okay tremors

650
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:28,080
and you'll see that that's the central

651
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,080
nervous system and you'll be like whoa

652
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,039
there's an actual reason for this

653
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,120
and when you see there's an actual

654
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:35,679
reason which is viruses

655
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,720
such as epstein-barr shingles so forth

656
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:38,559
and and

657
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,760
in other viruses too but viruses such as

658
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:41,679
epstein-barr and shingles

659
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,039
they release a neurotoxin that

660
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:46,240
neurotoxin

661
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:48,000
clings to nerves causes tremors and then

662
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:50,400
that neurotoxin is also

663
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,480
heavy metal based toxic heavy metal

664
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:55,039
based so the viruses such as ebv

665
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:57,200
feeds off of mercury then releases a

666
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:59,440
mercury byproduct that mercury byproduct

667
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,559
is so highly toxic it causes tremors it

668
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,559
clings to the nerves

669
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:04,559
clings to the vagus nerve the phrenic

670
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:05,280
nerves um all the different nerves and

671
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:08,080
then

672
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:10,000
you get that tremor and so it's good to

673
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,440
know what's going on so hey if i had

674
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,720
orthostatic tremors what i would be

675
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,919
doing is i'd be like trying to get the

676
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,159
metals out number one

677
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:18,080
i'd be trying to um i'd be eliminating

678
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:20,320
foods like eggs

679
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:22,240
get the eggs out because eggs raised

680
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:24,400
they raised viruses with eggs

681
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,080
in labs released the viruses over over

682
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,760
the years somehow they got out

683
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,760
and these viruses got into people

684
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,240
throughout the decades and then boom we

685
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,360
got

686
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,360
orthostatic tremors

687
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:40,960
so okay hi anthony i had breast implants

688
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:44,960
two years ago

689
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:46,480
so madolina so breast implants two years

690
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,159
ago since then i've been suffering from

691
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:51,440
chronic bloating and

692
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:54,080
vaginal candida my left breast implants

693
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,600
has always been harder than the other do

694
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,679
you think i can recover from these

695
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:00,159
symptoms without removing implants

696
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:01,760
i've just i have to say that without

697
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:03,200
realizing i've been suffering from these

698
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:05,120
symptoms since i was

699
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,679
little but now it looks like with the

700
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:10,880
implants they got much worse so

701
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:12,720
okay for for for one um

702
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,880
like the vaginal candida when you're

703
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,320
when you're candida is

704
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,000
a label for when they don't know what's

705
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,360
really happening underneath things and

706
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,760
not underneath it all

707
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:23,440
and so i i tell doctors this all the

708
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,039
time they ask me about candida because

709
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,679
candida is really confusing for a lot of

710
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:26,880
people and

711
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:28,799
it's never really candida it's

712
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,440
streptococcus and then candida gets the

713
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:31,120
label

714
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,799
yeast infections get the label when it's

715
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,240
streptococcus so

716
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:36,000
and then if you read the medical medium

717
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,720
books you'll learn that strep is a

718
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
cofactor to ebv so scrap is a cofactor

719
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,960
to epstein-barr

720
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,480
and then breast implant illness is

721
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:48,480
fatigue in the brain fog

722
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:51,039
and the nerve pain and all that combined

723
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,240
and that's neurological so then you're

724
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:55,520
looking at

725
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:57,120
viral plus viral creating neurological

726
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:59,600
and then you kind of find your way and

727
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:02,400
then you realize it's viruses that's why

728
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:04,400
one one a woman can have breast implants

729
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,480
and not have any problems because

730
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,520
she may not have she doesn't have an

731
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,120
active viral

732
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,799
issue in the moment so what i would do

733
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,559
is go to your doctor say look do i have

734
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:14,240
any kind of viral stuff going on do i

735
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:15,200
have any kind of epstein-barr going on

736
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,760
because that

737
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,840
that's what happens and um and it comes

738
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:21,120
out usually later so women with breast

739
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,360
implant illness

740
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:25,039
end up finding epstein-barr in their

741
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,799
blood at a doctor's office

742
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:28,159
two years down the road three years down

743
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,600
the road because it's hard to pick it

744
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:32,400
off at a lot of times during the blood

745
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:36,080
test you got to keep on going over time

746
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:38,320
and so um breast implants can

747
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,919
you know what happens is they can be a

748
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,440
trigger if something's going wrong with

749
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:43,760
them they can be a trigger but you have

750
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:46,480
to have something inside of you

751
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:48,400
that's getting triggered and the epstein

752
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:51,440
bar will create the brain fog

753
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:53,039
the fatigue um all kinds of different

754
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,760
symptoms and so forth and that's what's

755
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:56,320
happening

756
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,679
and that's why it's important like when

757
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,000
i go to cleanse the heal i'm like well

758
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:01,600
what's the symptom you're dealing with

759
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,159
and it's also why you had symptoms when

760
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:06,720
you're younger you notice madelina like

761
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:08,240
you said exactly you know you without

762
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,039
realizing it you were suffering from

763
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,440
these symptoms

764
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:13,600
since you were little but now it looks

765
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:15,039
like the implants got that much worse

766
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:17,440
what were those symptoms when you were a

767
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:20,640
little fatigued or were they fatigued

768
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:22,799
brain fog anxiety were they body pain

769
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,760
were they tingles and numbness when you

770
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:26,320
were little

771
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,880
and then migraines and then the breast

772
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,200
implants

773
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:31,039
could worsen them because they became

774
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,360
kind of a little bit of a trigger so

775
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:34,960
okay if if i had breast implants okay

776
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,320
now if i was a woman i would just be

777
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:39,120
working on

778
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,679
i would be working on the underlying

779
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,520
issue

780
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:44,080
so i'd be working on that and so i'd

781
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:45,520
look at the symptoms and find out what

782
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,880
were the symptoms i had when i was

783
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,360
younger obviously you're experiencing

784
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,720
them

785
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,000
that's what i would do and i'd be like

786
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,440
what are those symptoms let me find

787
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,400
those symptoms find out what the real

788
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:57,840
causes start

789
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:57,840
there you can talk to your doctor

790
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:17,360
so that's a good question there cindy

791
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:19,600
says why is it that you have to go to so

792
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:22,000
many doctors for every problem

793
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:24,240
i have to go to many doctors and visit i

794
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,440
have internal medicine doctor it's good

795
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,600
that you have one of those

796
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,120
refers me out to pulmonologists yeah i

797
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,080
know because he probably doesn't do

798
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,480
pulmonology

799
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,120
and then you got the bladder doctor yeah

800
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,640
you got the

801
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,400
you know the bladder doctor urologist

802
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,960
and everything else you got

803
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:40,480
in the heart doctor right cardiologist

804
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,440
and what happened to the doctor who can

805
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,840
help you with

806
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,919
without so many of the doctors yeah

807
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:48,000
totally i i completely understand

808
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:49,360
um you know it's it's like that even in

809
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,360
alternative medicine too

810
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,720
it's it's funny like alternative

811
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,679
alternative medicine you'll get a guy

812
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,120
that only does this

813
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:57,200
and you'll get somebody that only does

814
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:59,200
this and it's whatever really what the

815
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,880
doctor likes to focus on like the lyme

816
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,000
doctor just wants to focus online but

817
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,760
what's funny about that

818
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,039
anybody who goes to him will get a lyme

819
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,039
diagnosis so

820
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:08,240
that's the only problem anyone who goes

821
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:09,039
to another doctor will get another

822
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,159
diagnosis

823
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:12,159
it's pretty funny in alternative

824
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:14,159
medicine if you go to a gut doctor in

825
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:17,120
alternative medicine they just focus on

826
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:18,960

learned about epstein-barr

891
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:25,120
and but here's the thing what never

892
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:28,559
existed out there before was

893
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:30,159
what epstein-barr causes what symptoms

894
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:31,919
nobody knew any of that that's all

895
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:33,760
medical medium information

896
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:35,440
they only thought epstein-barr caused a

897
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:37,440
little little bit of fatigue

898
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,200
and a little bit of malaise and a little

899
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,399
fever once in a while that was all they

900
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,480
knew and

901
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:44,640
medical medium information opened the

902
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,600
door for the first time in medical

903
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:48,559
history

904
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:50,240
to actually link epstein-barr to all the

905
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:52,000
symptoms and conditions and it was

906
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,480
published by medical medium first and

907
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,720
also

908
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:56,640
i taught it and lectured it to doctors

909
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:59,039
over the last 35 years

910
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,320
and it's incredible what has happened

911
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:01,919
and transpired by that

912
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,679
spillings are being helped but the only

913
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:05,840
problem is it this

914
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:07,279
it doesn't get cited back to me many of

915
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,240
it doesn't get so people don't know

916
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:09,760
where to get the

917
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,679

meats and stuff like that i mean i would

933
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,159
get off of dairy products number one

934
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,120
that's what i would do personally if i

935
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:51,760
had hot flashes

936
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,720
i would get off milk cheese butter kefir

937
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:55,760
yogurt gone

938
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:58,559
i would get rid of that and you know and

939
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:59,519
and i would start with their eggs get

940
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:01,120
rid of eggs

941
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:02,320
boom get rid of all that if you're if

942
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,279
you're eating animal protein then i

943
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,279
would lower

944
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:06,559
the amount of animal protein that i was

945
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:08,880
eating i would

946
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:10,320
reduce it so maybe it's only once a day

947
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:13,600
or once every other day

948
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:15,120
if you're plant-based i would reduce

949
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:17,120
okay if you're plant-based i'll make

950
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:19,360
sure you're gluten-free of course

951
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:20,960
i would stay away from nutritional yeast

952
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:23,440
for sure because that would just

953
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,640
ruin the liver and then you know get rid

954
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,320
of that

955
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,919
and then i would reduce the amount of

956
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:30,720
nuts seeds

957
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:31,679
nuts seeds avocado i would reduce all

958
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,399
that

959
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:36,080
oils reduce all that bring that down and

960
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:37,360
lower your fats there if you got if you

961
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,159
got the hot flashes whether you're

962
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,399
plant-based or

963
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:41,360
animal product so that's what i would do

964
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:43,440
because i'm pro

965
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:45,279

too

999
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:58,399
i have been on all your books incredible

1000
00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:00,399
over a year starting with liver rescue

1001
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:03,919
due to liver methylation issue

1002
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:06,640
incredible i completed 20 day

1003
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:08,480
28 day cleanse 369 and i'm doing 32

1004
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:10,159
ounces of celery juice daily

1005
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,600
have many improvements so you got lots

1006
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:13,440
of improvements but hair

1007
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:15,679
still falling out does this mean i

1008
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:19,039
haven't found the root problem

1009
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:22,159
so look i'm not a flying fly on the wall

1010
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:24,080
um at your house and but what's you know

1011
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:26,559
first time it could take a little time

1012
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:28,399
and one thing's for sure that that when

1013
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:29,279
it comes down to the hair still falling

1014
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:32,559
out

1015
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:34,399
hair falls out later later on so what

1016
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:35,279
happens is if you've had a rough couple

1017
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:37,840
of years

1018
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:38,880
or a few years then the hair falls out

1019
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:41,760
later

1020
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,640
and i just you know i imagine you're not

1021
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,320
on caffeine

1022
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,840
but did you do caffeine in the past

1023
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:47,519
because you can have this delayed effect

1024
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,159
where hair falls out much later because

1025
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:50,159
of it

1026
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:53,279
did you do the matcha tea did you do the

1027
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:55,840
green tea matcha tea coffee drinks cacao

1028
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:56,320
that's that just makes hair fall out for

1029
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,240
women

1030
00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:00,000
it's really sad it beats their adrenals

1031
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,760
down and you end up losing one of the

1032
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,799
adrenaline hormone blends one of the

1033
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,480
adrenal hormones

1034
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:06,159
when you lose that just hair continues

1035
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,440
to fall out for a long time it can take

1036
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:09,760
a long time to restore

1037
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:11,520
and are you doing supplement protocols

1038
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:13,440
in the books too are you customizing

1039
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:15,280
them for yourself to what's going on

1040
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,639
like the hair loss protocol and cleanse

1041
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,480
the heel

1042
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:20,159
and that's something right there and you

1043
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,280
know and i'm look i'm sure you are you

1044
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:22,399
got the books you're working on i'm

1045
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,639

incredible incredible

1049
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:34,399
rebecca says i have both these books do

1050
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:36,879
you consult with people i don't consult

1051
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:39,280
with people i just consult doctors

1052
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:40,720
um that's that's and i've done that for

1053
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,960
35 years

1054
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:45,839
the reason reasons why i had so many

1055
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:48,159
people come to me when i used to consult

1056
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:50,000
many many years ago is through doctors

1057
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:51,040
doctors recommendations doctors

1058
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,359
recommending people

1059
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:55,040
to talk to me but i still have all those

1060
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:56,639
relationships with hundreds of doctors

1061
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:58,000
over the years plus new ones contacting

1062
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:00,079
me so what i do is

1063
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,359
i do help doctors on a daily basis so

1064
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:02,880
they can help their patients

1065
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:04,079
so you can bring any right back you can

1066
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,800
bring any of this information in the

1067
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:06,320
book or from

1068
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,560
what i'm helping you now with to your

1069
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,760
doctor of course so you have both these

1070
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:12,720
books amazing

1071
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:13,520
and you've had two neurologists tell me

1072
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:17,119
i have

1073
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:20,560
anxiety after having an mri eeg

1074
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:22,720
emg and i was cleared so

1075
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:24,240
so you had the eeg you had the mri and

1076
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:26,160
the emg

1077
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,599
and you're cleared so they but they say

1078
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,200
you have anxiety i have twitching

1079
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:31,440
involuntary movements

1080
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,400
jerks vibrations and basically they just

1081
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,839
say

1082
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:39,520
uh okay economists

1083
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:39,839
they cannot find anything what direction

1084
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:43,280
to

1085
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:45,440
turn so they say you just have anxiety

1086
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,560
um so if you look at the medical medium

1087
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,839
books and you look at

1088
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,280
cleanse the healing you can take the

1089
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:50,079
information to your doctor and i'm asked

1090
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,720
this by doctors

1091
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:54,240
and um this is neurological your

1092
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:56,160
symptoms are neurological

1093
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,839
so you look at your symptoms so when you

1094
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:59,040
look at cleanse the heel and you go back

1095
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:01,839
in there and you'll find

1096
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:03,040
twitching you'll find um you'll find

1097
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:05,440
that in there like the

1098
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,400
vibrations i talk about that when the

1099
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:10,240
body's humming

1100
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:12,400
buzzing vibrating twitching spasms

1101
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:13,920
you know ticks and spasms twitches all

1102
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,960
that stuff you'll find it in the back of

1103
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,720
the book

1104
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,160
and and you'll learn what the true

1105
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,280
causes are and then you'll be like whoa

1106
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,800
i found the true cause and you can go

1107
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,640
and take that to your doctor or work

1108
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,280
with it however you you need to or want

1109
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:26,400
to

1110
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:27,200
but that's that's you can find answers

1111
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,760
for that

1112
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:31,920
and and then you can even go into the

1113
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,599
anxiety section if you want to but

1114
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,599
that's not

1115
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:37,440
if if i had that i would know that

1116
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:38,560
that's not anxiety like if i had the

1117
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:41,760
jerking

1118
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:42,560
and the twitching and the spasms and all

1119
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,640
of that

1120
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:46,640
and i was living with that i would know

1121
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:49,280
it's not anxiety because i know it's a

1122
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:52,000
twitch it's a jerk it's a spasm and

1123
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:54,800
that's not anxiety

1124
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,880
it's just that anxiety doesn't help it

1125
00:36:54,800 --> 00:37:00,160
but anxiety also can happen

1126
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,160
simultaneously with it

1127
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:08,320

1130
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,720
what happens is when you have nervous

system conditions and your nervous

1132
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:17,200

1137
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:29,040

1138
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:30,160

so nancy says i ate an egg tonight what

1184
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:06,240
should i do now

1185
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:07,520
oh you know it's okay if you had an egg

1186
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:09,520
tonight it's all right

1187
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,960
it's all right just one day at a time i

1188
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,520
mean if you're are you dealing with

1189
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,040
symptoms

1190
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:15,200
are you dealing with the condition then

1191
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:18,240
just i wouldn't do any more eggs

1192
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:20,079
if you can um that's all right look it's

1193
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,359
it's not an easy time for anybody right

1194
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:22,960
now with what's happening

1195
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:25,359
with the plague that's been around us

1196
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,320
and making life so much difficult by the

1197
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:28,160
way is which

1198
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:29,760
which is why i want people to build

1199
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,480
their immune systems up it's why i want

1200
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,320
them to be

1201
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:34,240
you know taking care of themselves but

1202
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,560
it's perfectly fine if that's what you

1203
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:37,680
did

1204
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:39,440
it's all right and honestly nancy the

1205
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:42,720
whole world's eating eggs

1206
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:44,240
the whole world is eating eggs but um

1207
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,920
but what i would do is avoid them if you

1208
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:47,280
have a symptom a condition if you have a

1209
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:50,160
concern with your health

1210
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:51,760
just avoid them from here on out and and

1211
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:53,200
do some good things to count i look i

1212
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:55,359
like celery juice to counter

1213
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:56,720
any eggs you know because i know people

1214
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:57,839
that are eating eggs and it's like are

1215
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,040
you still doing your celery juice

1216
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:00,240
because at least you're doing something

1217
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:03,520
to counter it all

1218
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:06,800
and it's not that eggs were bad or

1219
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:08,720
are bad for us it's just that because

1220
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,400
of what they were used for and i talked

1221
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:12,960
about that before

1222
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:14,720
what they were used for to raise bugs in

1223
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:16,720
the labs years ago and they just

1224
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:18,079
happened to feed bugs but one egg's not

1225
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,920
going to do it okay people

1226
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:21,440
one egg's not going to do it all right

1227
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,960
i'm not trying to give everybody a

1228
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:24,560
license to just gobble down eggs i'm

1229
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,920
just saying that you're gonna be okay

1230
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:28,960
with that egg

1231
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:31,280
delight heart don't worry and um

1232
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,880
just try not to have any more if you're

1233
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,680
dealing with a symptom or condition it's

1234
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:39,200
okay

1235
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:40,880
it's not gonna hurt

1236
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:42,800
chrissy says can a protocol help

1237
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,680
tinnitus well what is the cause of

1238
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:46,480
tinnitus

1239
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:48,000
so what is it apparently science and

1240
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:50,400
research doesn't know

1241
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,160
unless you've had decibel damage like

1242
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:54,560
high decibels and

1243
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:55,920
you're in rock concerts for you know

1244
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:58,000
week after week and

1245
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,520
sitting next to the speakers and you had

1246
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,760
your ears just you know

1247
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:02,960
blown off but other than that i mean if

1248
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:05,359
that didn't happen

1249
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,720
all the time and you got and you you

1250
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:07,920
have this tinnitus that's been

1251
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:10,400
developing because that's

1252
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:11,200
viral tinnitus when it develops like

1253
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,119
that that's not

1254
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:15,200
damage but it's viral tinnitus that's

1255
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:16,880
when viral issues get into the labyrinth

1256
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,240
of the inner ear they inflame

1257
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:20,000
the nerve channel there and then you

1258
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:22,640
start hearing buzzing popping

1259
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,319

at that and it'll give you some guidance

1297
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:53,680
and then i would embark on a cleanse and

1298
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,680
that's what i would do personally

1299
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:58,640
start getting a hold on doll i'm glad

1300
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:00,240

00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,599
and it won't go away and it feels like

1306
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:18,240
falling

1307
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:20,000

well your anxiety's gonna go crazy

1311
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,760
because you're

1312
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:27,119
you're feeling like you're on a boat you

1313
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:28,319
know what happens that people deal with

1314
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:30,240
this they feel like they're walking

1315
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:32,079
along and they're going down

1316
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:34,240
and it's just like oh my god it's like

1317
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:34,800
so scary or your your balance is going

1318
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,240
one way

1319
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:38,480
and not the other and it's really

1320
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:40,240
difficult it's vertigo so that that's

1321
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,920
that's what that is that's just vertigo

1322
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:43,760
and um so

1323
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:45,359
i've talked about this that balanced

1324
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,240
feeling and being on a bow and the true

1325
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:47,760
causes to that

1326
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:49,680
now if you've been to your doctors

1327
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:51,680
you've had your mris you've had all your

1328
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:53,520
checkups they looked at everything

1329
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:55,040
they're looking for things and and all

1330
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:56,640
that well you can bring the book to your

1331
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:58,000
doctor too and say look since you can't

1332
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,599
find out what's going on

1333
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,119
he's got an answer in here he's got the

1334
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:02,880
true cause so you can find it in here

1335
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:06,000
and cleanse the heel in the back and

1336
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:07,599
vertigo that's you'll see the true cause

1337
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,560
and what happens when the vagus nerve

1338
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:10,640
gets inflamed

1339
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:12,800
the vagus nerve gets inflamed by a viral

1340
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:14,480
infection that they can't find because

1341
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,119
that's how viruses work they're so hard

1342
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:17,599
to find

1343
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:19,599
that viral infection keeps that that

1344
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:20,000
that vertigo going because the vagus

1345
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:21,599
nerve

1346
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,520
gets a neurotoxin attached to it

1347
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:24,880
neurotoxin comes from a virus the virus

1348
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:26,640
eliminates the neurotoxin

1349
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:28,480
the vagus nerve swells up and then you

1350
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:29,920
got your boat you're rocking on the boat

1351
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:32,480
you're going see-sawing and you're doing

1352
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:34,960
the room spins you hop in bed and the

1353
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:37,680
room is spinning and that's the type of

1354
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:39,119
vertigo and i talk about i

1355
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:41,440
i've been the only one with spirit of

1356
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:43,599
compassion that that put together

1357
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:47,119
epstein-barr virus and vertigo

1358
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:48,400
um and then you can learn how thousands

1359
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:49,599
of people have healed their vertigo

1360
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:52,079
through the information

1361
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:52,640
and spirit of compassion so i hope that

1362
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:54,319

1363
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:55,599
so you can you get a direction on where

1364

what can i do

1366
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:00,079
maybe maybe embark on the mono eating

1367
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:01,599
cleanse

1368
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:02,960
bringing in some celery juice or the

1369
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:04,720
mono eating cleanse and you start

00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:07,440
working with that so angela so you can

1371
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:07,440
start getting better

1372
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:17,200
so lisa says please talk about

1373
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:17,200
mysterious rashes

1374
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:20,960
you're welcome so i will talk about it

1375
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:24,720
for a minute the serious rashes

1376
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:27,839
eczema is a mysterious rash so

1377
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:30,240
psoriasis is a mysterious rash um

1378
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:31,200
rosacea is a mysterious rash they don't

1379
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:34,400
know the cause

1380
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:36,960
true cause unknown they just named it

1381
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:38,400
maybe they didn't name your ash but it's

1382
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:40,400
all the same in the sense

1383
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:41,839
meaning all the same in the sense of

1384
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:44,079
they're all mysterious

1385
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:46,480
really important to know this is how the

1386
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:48,560
industry has tricked everybody out

1387
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:50,880
they give a name for something if enough

1388
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:52,079
people have a certain identifiable

1389
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,760
relation to a rash

1390
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:54,960
then they put a name on it but they

1391
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,839
don't know what causes it so it's

1392
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:58,720
mysterious

1393
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:59,680
mystery illness is every diagnosis

1394
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:01,760
practically

1395
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:02,960
and and every autoimmune diagnosis is

1396
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:06,079
mystery illness every

1397
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:08,319
all of that so some mysterious rashes so

1398
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:09,920
i mean if i had a mysterious rash i

1399
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:11,119
would just be like looking in here and

1400
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:13,200
being like okay

1401
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:14,800
uh first of all he's got the street cred

1402
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:16,720
because thousands upon thousands of

1403
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:18,400
healing stories on rashes and

1404
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:19,920
eczema and psoriasis and all that stuff

1405
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,960
and what did they do well they did some

1406
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,720
celery juice they

1407
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:24,560
they stayed strong with that they got

1408
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:25,680
rid of eggs and dairy products they got

1409
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:27,599
rid of gluten right

1410
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,880
and they started bringing leafy greens

1411
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:30,480
like the spinach soup

1412
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:32,079
they started bringing wild foods like

1413
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:34,720
the wild blueberries

1414
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:36,560
um and they started to learn how to heal

1415
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:38,079
using like the herbal medicine right

1416
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:40,640
here the celery juice

1417
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:42,400
and they started getting minerals they

1418
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:43,920
started learning how to use b12 they

1419
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:45,359
started learning how to do these things

1420
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:47,280
and in the back of the book i talk about

1421
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:49,599
eczema psoriasis and other skin rashes

1422
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,599
and stuff

1423
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:56,240
so um

1424
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:57,520
gabrielle hi anthony what about tingling

1425
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:59,839
in my limbs

1426
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:01,760
after every shower thanks very much

1427
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:03,760
tingling and limbs after every shower

1428
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:05,280
what that is is when the shower's

1429
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:07,680
hitting you

1430
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:09,520
it's hitting your nerves this is why

1431
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:10,319
when people have any nerve sensitivities

1432
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:14,240
that

1433
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:17,280
if some people get so so

1434
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:19,760
sick with different neurological stuff

1435
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:20,880
that they can't take a shower the water

1436
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:23,680
hitting them

1437
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:24,319
will make them pass out or make them hit

1438
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:26,960
the floor

1439
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:28,960
or really hurt their nerves or cause

1440
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:30,800
lots of numbness and tingles

1441
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:32,800
you're just having a little tingling

1442
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,520
going on so what that just means is you

1443
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,800
got a little bit

1444
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:36,960
your phrenic nerves are a little

1445
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:39,760
sensitive that's all that is

1446
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:40,800
i mean you know i i talked to recently a

1447
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:43,520
practitioner who's a

1448
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:45,280
naturopath and this naturopath i mean i

1449
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:46,960
talk to mainly medical doctors

1450
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:48,640
but i do talk to some naturopaths in

1451
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:50,800
between it all um

1452
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:52,079
and i stuck in this naturopath that

1453
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:54,559
reached out to me

1454
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:56,800
and the they were talking about this

1455
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:59,200
very thing about taking a shower

1456
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:00,240
feeling weird sensations feeling tingles

1457
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,680
and stuff like that

1458
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:03,040
and i was explaining to this naturopath

1459
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:04,240
that people have a lot of sensitive

1460
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:07,280
nerves they have sensitive

1461
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:08,800
frantic nerves you know all kinds of

1462
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:09,599
different nerves get sensitive and the

1463
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:12,800
shower is

1464
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:14,720
hitting the muscles it's hitting the

1465
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:16,720
muscles and the heat's getting in

1466
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:18,079
and what happens is your nerves are

1467
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:20,240
coming out they're coming

1468
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:21,440
out into muscle in other places the

1469
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:22,160
nerves are going into all kinds of

1470
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,200
places

1471
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:25,040
it means they're a little bit

1472
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:26,800
hypersensitive a little extra sensitive

1473
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:28,160
do you have any anxiety along with that

1474
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:30,160
do you have other things going on with

1475
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:31,920
that um

1476
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:34,079
i mean i personally if i was dealing

1477
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:36,000
with that i would be like no gluten no

1478
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:37,760
caffeine never the caffeine

1479
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,599
no eggs no dairy products move that

1480
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:41,359
stuff completely out for now

1481
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:43,599
um i bring in a little bit more fruit in

1482
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:44,640
my diet i bring in some leafy greens in

1483
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:46,240
my diet

1484
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:48,240
so i would start doing that maybe do a

1485
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:49,599
little celery juice so i mean that's

1486
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:52,079
what i would do to start with

1487
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:53,119
and and and personally what i would do

1488
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:55,280
if i was going through that i would

1489
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:57,040
bring in some b12 the right kind of b12

1490
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:59,760
to learn about that in medical medium

1491
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:02,400
information but i would bring that in

1492
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:04,880
and that's where i would start if i was

1493
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,880
doing that

1494
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:08,160
so

1495
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:17,440
so tanya says literally all these

1496
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:19,280

tanya

1510
00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:50,480
okay so there's a question of there's

1511
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:51,040
there's a question of i have all the

1512
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:53,119
books

1513
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:55,280
bought all of them but you don't talk

1514
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:57,040
about durkheam's disease

1515
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:58,800
okay so there's that question right

1516
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:01,920
there and lisa

1517
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:06,000
i'm glad you asked that question okay um

1518
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:08,000
the the fatty lipomas and

1519
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,760
and other cis other symptoms that kind

1520
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,319
of like go along with it and stuff like

1521
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:13,119
that

1522
00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:13,520
but you know the thing is with that is

1523
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:15,200
with

1524
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:17,119
okay first of all fatty lipomas fatty

1525
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:20,079
lipomas i do talk about that in

1526
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:21,920
in these lives many times and what

1527
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:23,119
happens with the fatty lipoma it tends

1528
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:25,280
to grow these

1529
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:26,240
in order for the lipoma to grow it has

1530
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:28,000
to grow the

1531
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:29,359
uh these blood vessels so the blood

1532
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,559
vessels grow out of it and those blood

1533
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:32,559
vessels need to be

1534
00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:33,839
need to drop food they need to drop

1535
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:35,839
nutrients so

1536
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:37,040
i asked them i get asked about lipomas

1537
00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:39,359
all the time

1538
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:40,880
and and like how do you stop them from

1539
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:41,440
growing why are they growing what's

1540
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:43,920
going on

1541
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:44,720
and they grow because they're eating

1542
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:47,680
something

1543
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:48,240
they actually do feed it's the craziest

1544
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:50,319
thing

1545
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:51,520
and i know it sounds crazy but they have

1546
00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:53,119
because i talk to surgeons they're like

1547
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:55,359
well we got to kind of cut their roots

1548
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:57,280
when we come when we remove lipomas

1549
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:59,760
we have to kind of like sniff their

1550
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:01,440
little roots and

1551
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:03,119
nobody knows that it's the craziest

1552
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:03,680
thing how nobody knows this information

1553
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:07,119
but

1554
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:10,319
those little roots drop nutrients and if

1555
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:12,240
it feeds the lipoma and what this

1556
00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:15,200
lipomas like to eat

1557
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:16,880
they love eggs they love eggs like

1558
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:18,720
homers grow bigger and bigger when you

1559
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:21,440
eat more eggs eggs eggs

1560
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:22,640
that i know and they do also like some

1561
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:24,640
dairy products

1562
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:26,079
they do like that they don't care about

1563
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:26,960
gluten like homers don't care about

1564
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:28,240
gluten i mean

1565
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:30,160
you may not want to be on gluten for

1566
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:32,079
other reasons that i talk about but

1567
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:33,680
lipomas don't care about about gluten

1568
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:36,640
okay but they love

1569
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:37,599
dairy products they love eggs really

1570
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:40,240
important to know

1571
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:41,200
okay right there and and that alone you

1572
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:43,280
can be proactive

1573
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:44,240
and if you're eating a lot of fat in

1574
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:48,000
your diet

1575
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:50,720
okay so fatty tumors

1576
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,839
yeah um drop down the fats that's

1577
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:54,480
another thing too

1578
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:56,240
and and that's that's something all on

1579
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:57,680
its own

1580
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:59,440
but really it takes a virus to make a

1581
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:02,720
lipo

1582
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:04,160
and look what i would do is dirkham's

1583
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:06,160
disease it's like what's all the

1584
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:07,760
symptoms of dirkham's disease

1585
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:09,680
what are the symptoms and i would

1586
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:12,800
individually look at the symptoms

1587
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:15,040
because it doesn't mean durkheim's is

1588
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:17,040
the like they name it that but they

1589
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:18,400
don't understand the symptoms in between

1590
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:20,720
it all so you take a look at you

1591
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:22,400
identify the symptoms on their own when

1592
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:23,040
you identify their sense so when you say

1593
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,480
look

1594
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:26,319
you talk about all these other things in

1595
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:29,760
the books but you don't talk about that

1596
00:52:26,319 --> 00:52:31,440
well no you take the specific symptom

1597
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:32,960
and you take that specific symptom and

1598
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:35,040
you go on the back of the book and you

1599
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:36,240
line it up and then yeah it turns out i

1600
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:38,559
did talk about that

1601
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:40,400
in fact now you know the cause of it so

1602
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:42,160
it's really important

1603
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:44,480
so rene says why is my hashimoto's

1604
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:46,319
thyroiditis affecting me neurologically

1605
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:47,760
really awesome question incredible

1606
00:52:46,319 --> 00:52:49,680
question for tonight

1607
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:52,000
my neurologist can't give me an answer

1608
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:57,040
because hashimoto's thyroiditis

1609
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:58,559
is the third stage of epstein-barr

1610
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:01,520
and you'll learn that in the medical

1611
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:04,559
medium books so hashimoto's thyroiditis

1612
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:05,920
is the third stage of epstein-barr so

1613
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:07,599
what happens is

1614
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:09,520
the first stage of epstein-barr is when

1615
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:11,680
you get infected by it so

1616
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:13,920
mononucleosis it's not mononucleosis but

1617
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:14,640
it's pre-mononucleosis you get infected

1618
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:16,160
by it

1619
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:18,720
it sits around in your system a little

1620
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:20,400
bit and then it kind of camps out

1621
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:22,079
and then the second stage of

1622
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:24,880
epstein-barr is

1623
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:26,160
boom mononucleosis it goes into war with

1624
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:28,800
your immune system

1625
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:30,720
so it means you had mono whether you

1626
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:32,079
realized it or not one time in your life

1627
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:34,720
going all the way back

1628
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:35,760
and then the third stage after it sits

1629
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:37,599
in the liver

1630
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:39,760
after mononucleosis it goes and hides

1631
00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:41,119
itself in the liver it leaves the liver

1632
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:44,160
in the third stage

1633
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:46,960
and goes to your thyroid so

1634
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:47,440
hashimoto's thyroiditis is epstein-barr

1635
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:51,119
stage

1636
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:52,960
three and and anything thyroid related

1637
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:53,760
hypothyroidism hypothyroidism is

1638
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:55,520
epstein-barr

1639
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:57,440
stage three this isn't research in

1640
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:58,800
science this is a head of research in

1641
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:00,000
science doctors tell me all the time

1642
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:01,680
that medical media book

1643
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,040
information is way ahead of research and

1644
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:04,400
science that's why i talk to have to

1645
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:06,079
talk to doctors every day

1646
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:08,480
this is a medical textbook so the

1647
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:10,160
information's in here now

1648
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:12,000
and you can't get that anywhere else

1649
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:14,960
this information doesn't exist it's just

1650
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:16,400
the circuit is how to live longer uh how

1651
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:19,760
to anti-age uh

1652
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:20,240
telomeres um top five foods that are

1653
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:22,319
great

1654
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:24,160
top five foods to help you live longer

1655
00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:25,920
uh be at your beth i mean

1656
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:27,520
it's like rhetoric out there between the

1657
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:29,599
plant-based books and

1658
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:31,280
the paleo-based books and the circuit

1659
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:32,880
and the podcast it's like

1660
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:34,319
none of it addresses all this real

1661
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:35,839
information it's only gonna

1662
00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:37,200
it's only mm info but they'll take

1663
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:38,640
little pieces out there and sound like

1664
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:40,000
they're really smart and not cited back

1665
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:40,799
to medical medium information it's

1666
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,240
actually funny

1667
00:54:40,799 --> 00:54:44,160
because i'm discriminated against

1668
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:47,359
because of where i get the info from

1669
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:48,960
um so but the point is is that that

1670
00:54:47,359 --> 00:54:51,119
hashimoto's thyroiditis

1671
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:53,440
that's of the epstein-barr viral

1672
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:54,640
infection at stage three epstein-barr

1673
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:56,559
but here's the thing

1674
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:57,839
stage four i've seen bar is it stays in

1675
00:54:56,559 --> 00:54:59,280
the thyroid but then it leaves the

1676
00:54:57,839 --> 00:55:00,240
thyroid and it starts to aggravate

1677
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:02,880
nerves

1678
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:03,359
so that's epstein-barr so go to your

1679
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:05,920
doctor

1680
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:07,200
talk to your doctor ask them hey um

1681
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:07,920
there's a lot of doctors that use these

1682
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:09,440
books or in the

1683
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:11,200
in their that's the whole point they're

1684
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:12,240
in their doctor's offices then they know

1685
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:14,960
why

1686
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:16,559
um people have hashimoto's thyroiditis

1687
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:18,160
now they know it's epstein-barr

1688
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:19,599
then you can start looking into it what

1689
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:22,240
can you do all this stuff talk to your

1690
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:22,240
doctor about it

1691
00:55:23,359 --> 00:55:32,559
so he can learn or she can learn um

1692
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:34,319
let's see lacrecia is there anything you

1693
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:35,680
recommend besides celery juice for

1694
00:55:34,319 --> 00:55:39,680
weight loss i

1695
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:43,440
am periodic patient and electric patient

1696
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:46,799
and they push protein

1697
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:48,559
is a vegan diet best i also have cfs and

1698
00:55:46,799 --> 00:55:50,559
fibromyalgia well first of all you got

1699
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:52,640
if you have the cfs the chronic fatigue

1700
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:53,119
syndrome and the fibrobiology you

1701
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:55,359
already

1702
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:57,119
are identifying one thing you have going

1703
00:55:55,359 --> 00:55:58,640
on so when you look at the true cause

1704
00:55:57,119 --> 00:56:00,880
you learn that that's viral so that's

1705
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:03,520
one thing right there okay and yes

1706
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:04,480
you can you can do lots for weight is is

1707
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:07,200
what you can do

1708
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:09,280
you there's lots of information like in

1709
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:11,040
cleanse the heel there's a whole weight

1710
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:12,720
weight loss weight gain weight loss

1711
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:14,160
information it's packed in here there's

1712
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:16,799
a protocol in here for that

1713
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:18,160
there's even in the back um there's a

1714
00:56:16,799 --> 00:56:20,160
protocol back there

1715
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:21,839
it's really about lowering fats so

1716
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:23,599
whether you're animal protein

1717
00:56:21,839 --> 00:56:25,440
or you're plant-based it's about

1718
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:27,440
lowering fats if you want to be

1719
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:29,040
plant-based yes you can be plant-based

1720
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:29,520
and then you can figure out how to do it

1721
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:31,920
like

1722
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:32,880
if i had that condition like me

1723
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:34,960
personally

1724
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:36,400
anthony william had that condition i

1725
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:38,640
would do like

1726
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:40,079
the mono eating i would go into the mono

1727
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:40,480
eating right here so the cleanse is in

1728
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:41,839
here

1729
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:43,520
and i would get comfortable with one and

1730
00:56:41,839 --> 00:56:44,000
see how it's working for me that's what

1731
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:46,400
i would do

1732
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,599
i'd probably be doing the potato one

1733
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:49,760
personally for me

1734
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:51,440
or maybe papaya banana one with the

1735
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:52,559
celery juice and the lettuce and so

1736
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:54,559
forth but

1737
00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:56,400
that's something i would try a little

1738
00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:58,720
bit or you can even do something even

1739
00:56:56,400 --> 00:57:01,119
just the morning cleanse which is so

1740
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:02,000
so easy and simple and it reduces your

1741
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:04,160
fats

1742
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,040
so that when your fats are down that can

1743
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:07,119
help all

1744
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:09,040
like that all on on its own right there

1745
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:10,960
and then the weight can start going down

1746
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:12,559
so yeah and if you if you want to do

1747
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:14,640
animal proteins

1748
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:16,240
keep keep the fats low keep them down if

1749
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:16,799
you want to be plant-based keep the fats

1750
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:19,359
low

1751
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:20,960
because then the liver can recoup and

1752
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:22,480
you can start losing weight and do your

1753
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:24,839
celery juice and do it all like you're

1754
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:27,839
cleaning up the liver so it's really

1755
00:57:24,839 --> 00:57:27,839
important

1756
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:31,920
um

1757
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:38,720
[Music]

1758
00:57:36,319 --> 00:57:40,079
sand you gotta inguinal hernia so the

1759
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:42,480
whole thing with that is

1760
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:43,280
it's about reducing that it's it's about

1761
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:45,839
you the thing is

1762
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:46,880
is that don't overeat if i had that i

1763
00:57:45,839 --> 00:57:48,799
wouldn't overeat

1764
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:50,160
i just wouldn't that's one of the keys i

1765
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:51,599
talked to doctors all the time about

1766
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:54,240
this they asked me about this

1767
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:55,920
and that's the first thing i would do is

1768
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:56,640
you just don't overeat that's a key

1769
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:58,799
right there

1770
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:59,760
so the muscle wall weakness if you

1771
00:57:58,799 --> 00:58:02,240
overeat

1772
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:03,839
and you're doing big meals all at once

1773
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:05,680
you can pop a cork

1774
00:58:03,839 --> 00:58:06,880
and that can happen okay you don't want

1775
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:08,720
to pop a cork

1776
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:10,400
and so it's it's you want to keep your

1777
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:12,240
meals like

1778
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:13,920
you know you can do little meals all day

1779
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:15,920
long however you want to do it

1780
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:17,359
um i mean that's that's that's the

1781
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:19,520
safest way to go

1782
00:58:17,359 --> 00:58:21,599
not eat like three big meals or one big

1783
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:22,960
meal and stuff yourself because then you

1784
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:24,799
put all this pressure

1785
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:26,480
if you get stuffed you put all this

1786
00:58:24,799 --> 00:58:28,240
pressure and then that puts pressure

1787
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:30,559
up against the intestinal tract going

1788
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:37,839
into the stomach wall lining

1789
00:58:30,559 --> 00:58:37,839
so um so that that's right there

1790
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:43,920
um so aaliyah what if you have such a

1791
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:45,599
wide range of symptoms that you fall

1792
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:47,119
into so many categories

1793
00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:49,440
where do you start what's your more

1794
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:52,480
annoying symptom what's your second

1795
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:53,760
most annoying symptom um aaliyah like i

1796
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:55,440
would go into cleanse to heal

1797
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:56,960
get the book out of the library for free

1798
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:58,559
if you want go back

1799
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:00,240
go back to the symptoms and conditions

1800
00:58:58,559 --> 00:59:02,799
section and look for your

1801
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:03,680
like more annoying symptoms and then you

1802
00:59:02,799 --> 00:59:06,000
see

1803
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:06,880
that if you address that annoying

1804
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,440
symptom

1805
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:09,920
or one of them your second most annoying

1806
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:11,680
symptom

1807
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:13,200
your third most annoying symptom kind of

1808
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:15,839
go to those if you want

1809
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:16,480
address them and what you'll find or

1810
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:18,319
address

1811
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:20,400
two symptoms but what you'll find is all

1812
00:59:18,319 --> 00:59:23,520
of a sudden as you're addressing that

1813
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:25,440
other symptoms start to disappear and

1814
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:27,280
start to ease off and that's that's how

1815
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:33,280
i would handle it

1816
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:37,680

world less

1875
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:36,559
toxic with lots of love support and

1876
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:38,960
resources at the same time

1877
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:40,480
and then happen to stay that way while

1878
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:42,240
here on earth

1879
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:44,240
if you have ever found yourself lying in

1880
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:46,480
bed scrolling through somebody's feet of

1881
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:47,520
waterfalls beaches and smoothie bowls

1882
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:49,440
with peanut butter

1883
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:51,280
wondering where you went wrong to land

1884
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:52,799
yourself on your little mattress island

1885
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:55,520
apart from the world

1886
01:01:52,799 --> 01:01:57,200
know this you didn't go wrong you're not

1887
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:58,880
faulty you're not less than

1888
01:01:57,200 --> 01:02:01,039
the reality is that outside

1889
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:03,200
circumstances and inherited poisons and

1890
01:02:01,039 --> 01:02:04,079
pathogens not internal weaknesses

1891
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:06,799
determine

1892
01:02:04,079 --> 01:02:08,559
the challenges we face and someone who

1893
01:02:06,799 --> 01:02:10,400
has suffered health challenges can

1894
01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:12,240
change their fate what i'm saying is

1895
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:13,920
if you guys are struggling because you

1896
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:15,520
got the pathogens you're dealing with

1897
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:17,359
and just so you know everybody gets sick

1898
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:18,640
people who don't seem like they get sick

1899
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:20,400
now and they're young they're strong

1900
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:22,160
they get sick later everybody gets

1901
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:23,359
symptoms later everybody gets sick but

1902
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:25,200
just know

1903
01:02:23,359 --> 01:02:26,960
that you can change your fate when you

1904
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:28,240
know and understand about the different

1905
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:30,319
pathogens that you have

1906
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:32,319
about the different toxins that you have

1907
01:02:30,319 --> 01:02:34,240
and then we can turn that around

1908
01:02:32,319 --> 01:02:35,920
we can take control over health the key

1909
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:36,880
is to know how prevention and healing

1910
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:39,760
