00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:40,720
of going on pharmaceuticals that's

129
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,960

right

139
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,199
this is the new edition right here when

140
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:02,400
when the first book came out

141
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,440
i used a word i used a word in the

142
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,720
health scene

143
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:09,840
that no one else used at the time

144
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,840
the word was misinformation that was a

145
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,000
medical medium word of course i didn't

146
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,880
create the word so before anybody starts

147
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,800
talking crap

148
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,240
and smack and say oh now the medical

149
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,600
medium is claiming he created the word

150
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:24,080
misinformation

151
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,120
but i didn't create the word but what

152
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,960
happened

153
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:30,960
was i used the word and i used it a lot

154
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:34,160
when no one in the health scene

155
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:36,560
used the word because the medical

156
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,360
the medical establishment science and

157
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,280
research

158
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,440
medical science research had a

159
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:44,639
tremendous amount of misinformation

160
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,479
still due to this day right and so when

161
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,680
i broke out on the scene with the book

162
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,680
and i've been in the scene

163
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,360
for over 30 years but when the first

164
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,800
book came out

165
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,560

191
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,039
you could be young and your liver can

192
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,759
fill up and then the weight starts

193
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:48,160
coming on

194
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,960
and guess what you can be older and your

195
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,280
and and

196
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,080
and your liver fills up and the weight

197
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,440
comes on

198
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,759
everybody's a little different on their

199
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:59,440
timeline of when that filter

200
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:03,520
gets clogged up really important to know

201
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:06,400
so guys i'm putting in some um

202
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,680
onions here i got carrots i got celery

203
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,639
i'm making the medical medium healing

204
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,039
broth

205
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,759
see the hormone blame is just to trick

206
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,880
out women

207
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:16,800
and it's bad if you fall for it because

208
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,400
yes hormones become imbalanced

209
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,160
absolutely and yes

210
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,240
i believe in in hormones being

211
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,919
imbalanced of course and i believe in

212
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:27,440
every aspect of that

213
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:29,840
but what women have been tricked with is

214
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,280
they're blamed for all their problems as

215
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:34,720
being hormonal

216
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:36,560
that was a man's trick to women so

217
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,800
medical research and science

218
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,479

219
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,960

scapegoat

282
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,360
medical industry back

283
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:41,519
in the day and it really was i've talked

284
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,000
to doctors back in the 90s that were

285
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:46,959
80 years old that were having they were

286
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,360
in the heyday in the 1950s and 60s

287
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:50,240
i've heard it all i know what the scene

288
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,839
was

289
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,160
so i'm cooking cooking some healing

290
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,160
broth

291
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,480
so what happened was though they don't

292
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,560
let that go

293
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,600
that is still here today it's in

294
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,839
alternative medicine

295
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,360
full throttle it's in conventional

296
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:09,120
medicine full throttle

297
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:10,320
and and weight gain just like many other

298
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:14,000
things

299
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:17,600
is blamed on hormones

300
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:21,519
yes your hormones can be imbalanced yes

301
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,519
it can i told you guys

302
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:26,720
get out of my way today because i got a

303
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,240
lot of other stuff to talk about

304
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,560
so you might want to hang in there for

305
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,560
this

306
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:36,959
um a sluggish stagnant liver causes your

307
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,560
weight gain

308
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,240
and it can happen when you're young and

309
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:44,160
it can happen when you're older

310
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:46,160
it just happens that's what creates the

311
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,600
weight gain okay

312
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,680
so i'm gonna put a i'm gonna put some

313
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,839
shiitakes in here i'm gonna put some

314
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:55,360
mushrooms let's get them in here so

315
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:58,399
get about a cup in here i'll do like

316
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,399
a few of these caps

317
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,040
you guys what you'll notice right here

318
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,240
when i'm cutting you notice i'm not

319
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,399
doing it this way

320
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,839
i want to show you something okay you

321
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,640
know i'm not doing it this way you see

322
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,399
this right here

323
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,760
see see what i'm doing right here see

324
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,640
this

325
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,240
right you notice on that the reason why

326
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,040
i'm not cutting like that when i'm with

327
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,880
you guys

328
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,079
and i'm cutting and i'm cutting kind of

329
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,519
stupid on here

330
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:24,320
where i'm doing it like this where i'm

331
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,920
like oop almost going to cut my thumb

332
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,600
off whoa whoa right the reason why i'm

333
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,240
doing that

334
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,079
is because the way this is all set up

335
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,120
and the way the board's rigged

336
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:37,440
is it's not meant right here in in my

337
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,399
little kitchen studio right here to do

338
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,320
it that way

339
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:41,760
i have to basically clear everything off

340
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,000
set the cutting board up differently

341
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,079
pull

342
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,760
the stuff in and start really chopping

343
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:48,160
fast but we're casually

344
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,800
doing this casually chopping so really

345
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,320
kind of

346
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,480
you know i can just basically just

347
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,360
gently chop up stuff but you won't see

348
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,279
me do the

349
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,279
the pro stuff going on which you could

350
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:58,560
easily do i mean in the sense where just

351
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:00,079
like you guys do

352
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:03,680
where you know you you're cutting

353
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:06,639
everything a certain way

354
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,639
but so if you'll notice i'm doing it

355
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,399
this way it's only because we're cash

356
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:12,079
and i'm doing it real slow methodical

357
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:15,120
talking at the same time

358
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:19,200
so the way coming on

359
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:20,560
is nita says preaching to sell his books

360
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,160
that's funny because you can go into the

361
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,760
library and get them for free i've been

362
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:27,519
saying that for years

363
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:29,680
i probably sent millions over the years

364
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:32,639
into the library to actually get them

365
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:36,320
for free and it made me not a penny

366
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,880
and i'm the only author that's ever done

367
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,160
that

368
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,680
where i want everybody to go in the

369
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,560
library and get it for free that's

370
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,760
number one

371
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:46,720
number two is i can sell i can sell

372
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:48,480
courses for thousands of dollars classes

373
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,880
for thousands of dollars

374
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,200
i can sell products for thousands of

375
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,079

and just for the record you guys anita

410
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,839
i've been asked to write the books for

411
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,240
years decades

412
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,760

00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:04,399
but i understand what you're saying i

415
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,399
understand

416
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,000
all right you guys going to get a few

417
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,760
more things in here so this is i'm going

418
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,040
to actually add some water in this

419
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,040
too right now so i'm going to do

420
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:20,480
and get this going so i'm making the

421
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,279
healing broth i got two tomatoes that

422
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,279
are gonna go in here

423
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,040
so i'm gonna chop up some tomatoes

424
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:35,680
that's going to go in the healing broth

425
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:38,639
so here's what causes weight gain

426
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:40,320
years and years of coffee chocolate

427
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:43,279
caffeine

428
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:45,440
a green tea any kind of caffeine energy

429
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:47,440
drinks you burn your liver out you burn

430
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,480
your adrenals out and the liver gets

431
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,519
burnt out from

432
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:54,160
caffeine from adrenaline highs and then

433
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:56,079
after your 20 years of burning your

434
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:59,120
liver out and adrenals out

435
00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:00,000
okay after you do that you end up with

436
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,199
the weight gain

437
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,480
and it's going to be blamed on your

438
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:04,079
hormones how about that one here's

439
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,639
another thing that causes the weight

440
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:07,199
gain

441
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,920
the high fat diets see when you're

442
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:10,320
younger

443
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,079
and your liver is working pretty good

444
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,600
you can do the high fat diet every

445
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:14,959
single day you're taught to eat the high

446
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,839
fat diet every day you're taught to eat

447
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:17,920
lots chicken

448
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,600
eggs has nothing to do about whether i

449
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,680
like animal products or not or

450
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,720
i i support animal protein diets i

451
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,279
support plant-based

452
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,880
diets but every single day you're on a

453
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,440
high fat diet how many times did you eat

454
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,959
bacon

455
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,240
well the liver is going to pay the price

456
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:31,759
later on and your weight is going to

457
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,680
come on down the road maybe when you're

458
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:36,800
40 maybe when you're 50.

459
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:38,560
um you know how many nuts and seeds have

460
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,320
you eaten nut butters peanut butter how

461
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,079
many oils have you had

462
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,160
and then this and then the liver gets

463
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:45,519
sluggish and stagnant it gets beaten

464
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,959
down down the road

465
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,560
and then your weight gain comes on it

466
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:50,079
might come on when you're 30 and you

467
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,199
can't keep it off it might come out when

468
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:53,759
you're 40.

469
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:54,480
all those eggs all the chicken all the

470
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:57,360
fish

471
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,079
all the fat right you know it just

472
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,279
oatmeal

473
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:04,240
is high in fat just so you know

474
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:06,720
a cup of oatmeal is a minimum of five

475
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,800
grams of fat in a cup of oatmeal

476
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,480
so it's like not also not only doing

477
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,680
bacon and eggs and you're doing chicken

478
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,279
you're doing oils

479
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,720
and then you're doing you're doing your

480
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:16,240
cheese you're doing your butter and

481
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,120
you're doing your chocolate which is

482
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,800
high in fat

483
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,240
and then on top of that you think you're

484
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,000
eating healthy for five seconds eating

485
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,079
your oatmeal and then that's high in fat

486
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,079
it's like it's like you just it you

487
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:27,839
can't keep it in check so then the liver

488
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:29,920
gets beaten down over the years and then

489
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,639
20 years later boom the weight comes on

490
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,720
then

491
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:34,240
the liver has been beaten up by all that

492
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,000
caffeine all those years and then what

493
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,920
about pharmaceuticals too

494
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,680
what about any kind of pharmaceuticals

495
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:42,959

520
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,080
the healing broth as the base for the

521
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,480
sweet potato tortilla soup

522
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:38,080

let's get the bulbs of garlic the garlic

526
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,200
in here you could do about

527
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:50,480
eight cloves you could do a little less

528
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,480
if that's something you want to do

529
00:17:53,440 --> 00:18:05,919
start getting these going here

530
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:08,559
so here's what's going on

531
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:10,160
when the medical medium you know and

532
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:12,000
what happens the same thing with

533
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,600
weight gain with children it's the liver

534
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,360
and the liver getting maxed out early

535
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,080
with toxic heavy metals which children

536
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,520
have

537
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:21,280
lots of toxic heavy metals so

538
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,559
they're passed down from their their

539
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,080
parents too

540
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:28,000
so i'm gonna get some cloves of garlic

541
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:31,039
in here i'm throwing that in here

542
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,080
here's the thing about misinformation i

543
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,480
used the word

544
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:36,000
misinformation when the first book came

545
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,679
out and i used it in lectures

546
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,039
shortly before the first book came out

547
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,960
years ago

548
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:43,520
no one was using that word on the

549
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:45,440
internet it was all about

550
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,360
health and everybody thought there was

551
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,760
no misinformation

552
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:51,840
but what i did was i exposed areas of

553
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,600
where the misinformation was and i spent

554
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:57,840
a great deal of time it's about smoky

555
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,840
mountain paradise i think i just saw

556
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,679
um

557
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:07,840
but what happened is that word i used in

558
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:10,320
all my articles i used it on the blog

559
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:12,240
i used it everywhere in lectures and

560
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,840
everything about how much misinformation

561
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,760

internet 24 7.

575
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:44,559
no one used it before i was the only one

576
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:47,200
using it spell showing

577
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:48,640
showing showcasing where everybody was

578
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,640
messing up

579
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,720
including like coffee enemas how bad

580
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:55,760
they were including things in

581
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:57,760
alternative movement and then including

582
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:00,880
things like shingles right

583
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,840
medical the medical industry tricks you

584
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,880
out and says that

585
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,679
shingles is the chickenpox virus so what

586
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,240
i did was

587
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:08,880
that's misinformation the chicken box

588
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,880
virus

589
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,480
is separate that's a different variety

590
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,080
of virus herpetic family

591
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,600
the shingles is an entirely different

592
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,679
virus than the chickenpox

593
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,880
but they got everybody snowed so i put

594
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,840
out the truth and said there's

595
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,840
misinformation

596
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,840
all right so we got the garlic in there

597
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:31,679

601
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:39,440
medical medium healing broth if you just

you can peel it back a little i'm

606
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:47,440
peeling it back a little you don't have

607
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,600
to in a healing broth

608
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,799
you can keep the skin on i've done that

609
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:54,000
a whole bunch of times

610
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:54,000
do that mostly really

611
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,120
popping a little ginger in here gonna

612
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:02,240
slice that up in this healing broth and

613
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:05,600
throw it in

614
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:08,400

617
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,159
i just didn't put my

618
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:16,720

many times i've made it really hot so

621
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:25,360
i'm going to put a little pop in here

622
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:25,360
that's it a bit of chili pepper in there

623
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,120

flakes

628
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:45,039
put some pepper flakes in here if you

629
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,919
don't like the heat you don't have to do

630
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:47,919
a lot of them

631
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:50,159
i tend to spike it a little too much and

632
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:54,080
the next thing you know i got something

633
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:56,080
really hot going on where it's too hot

634
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:58,000
i also have a pepper over here i think i

635
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:01,280
might pop that in i think i lost my

636
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:04,720
hot pepper i think i lost it

637
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:06,240
all right let me put the lid on

638
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,960
oh let me get some parsley and that's

639
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:13,840
the last thing here i forgot my parsley

640
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,840
see you guys

641
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:22,240
so now what happens is anything i say

642
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,880
you'll get a whole bunch of people i'd

643
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,200
be like

644
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,080
well science hasn't backed it up

645
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,440
misinformation

646
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,120
so i want to talk about that a little

647
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,640
bit about science and research but

648
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:34,400
before i go in there

649
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:36,159
it reminds me about genes

650
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,880
did you guys know that everybody's being

651
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:42,240
diagnosed

652
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,240
as having gene issues

653
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:50,960
um amina says bell's palsy

654
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:54,640
is shingles but i had it from 2007 is it

655
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:56,799
it is improved but have uh

656
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,679
oh yeah so you still have an issue with

657
00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:01,039
that now but

658
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:02,400
still recovering is all healing in your

659
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:04,559
book for me

660
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,679
is the same for shingles sorry guys i

661
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:08,080
got so much

662
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:10,000
bright lights in my eyes sometimes a

663
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,200
reflection on a computer screen is not

664
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,240
easy to read a comment

665
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:16,480
so i'll try it try it better um

666
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,320
no one knew shingles was bell's palsy

667
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,799
just for anybody else who's listening

668
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,919
there

669
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:26,240
that was medical medium information

670
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:27,840
so now doctors are actually diagnosing

671
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,200
people with bell's palsy and they're

672
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,720
saying well it could be the shingles

673
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,640
virus that originates from

674
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,000
millions of medical medium books getting

675
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,760
out there

676
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,200
this book right here changed the rules

677
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,360
on bell's palsy

678
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,880
so and that's the shingles virus so

679
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:43,360
that's how it works there

680
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,919
goes palsy is a non-rashing shingles

681
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,159
virus

682
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:47,440
gonna have shingles and years later it

683
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:50,159
show up differently

684
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,520
but but it but it'll happen when you

685
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:53,360
don't even have shingles you don't even

686
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:55,919
have a rash but the virus is there and

687
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:58,240
it'll cause the bell's palsy

688
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:00,080
so i just put uh parsley in here let

689
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:03,200
this get ready to cook

690
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:05,840
cook up nice so i'm making a healing

691
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,840
broth

692
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,279
i want to get this pumping away and i'll

693
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,919
show you guys the healing broth in a

694
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:11,520
little bit

695
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:12,799
if you guys just got on here after i do

696
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,440
the healing broth it's going to be the

697
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:15,279
base

698
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:19,039
for the sweet potato tortilla soup that

699
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:22,799
i'm making on ig and tick tock

700
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:22,799
so everybody

701
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:30,159
um so everybody like believe

702
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:33,120
that first of all the shingles was um

703
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:35,039
the chickenpox virus and that's not true

704
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,960
it's a different bug altogether but that

705
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:38,159
just shows you how much misinformation

706
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,159
is in the medical

707
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:41,840
world it's really sad there's

708
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:43,440
non-rashing shingles varieties and

709
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:45,200
there's rashing varieties

710
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,039
there's over 30 varieties of shingles

711
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,799
out there and them info and i brought

712
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:51,440
that to light for people

713
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:53,360
sciatic nerve pain okay whether you have

714
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:55,360
a back issue or not that sciatic

715
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,400
nerve pain gets really inflamed from the

716
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,919
shingles virus

717
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,159
that's one thing right there trigeminal

718
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:01,760
neuralgia that's the shingles bell's

719
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:03,440
palsy that's the shingles

720
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:06,400
so these are things that that medical

721
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,400
medium brought to light

722
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,880
but you guys i want to talk about jeans

723
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:13,200
for a little bit and head into there

724
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,400
so fasten your seatbelts a little bit

725
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:18,159
because really the

726
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:20,640
the gene blame game and

727
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:21,200
the gene scam that's upon people right

728
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,679
now it's

729
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,400
it's really sad and where it's going

730
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:28,320
it's

731
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:30,960
they've weaponized the gene terminology

732
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,880
it weaponized it against everybody so

733
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,440
it's purposely

734
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,480
being used against you i want you to

735
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:39,200
know this

736
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:41,039
you might want to get an herbal tea or

737
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,240
something lemon balm tea before you hear

738
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:46,400
this stuff

739
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:49,840
but medical system

740
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:52,640
is trying to

741
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:54,559
and they're doing a great job convince

742
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:57,600
all of you

743
00:25:54,559 --> 00:26:00,640
that your genes are going bad

744
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:03,679
there's a reason for it and

745
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:05,440
they want you to believe that not only

746
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:08,480
are your genes going bad but your

747
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:12,080
children's genes are bad

748
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:15,200
and that your children aren't perfect

749
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:18,080
and they're all genetically tore up

750
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,120
they're all genetically mutated it's

751
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,679
really evil

752
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,720
actually because the medical system

753
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:26,159
wants you

754
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:27,520
to think your child's genes are all

755
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:29,600
messed up

756
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:31,039
that's their game that's the direction

757
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,480
they have to go

758
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:34,159
and there's a reason why they're going

759
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:37,440
this direction

760
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:39,360
because hey dr fans here even

761
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,760
even the alternative doctors are saying

762
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:45,200
the genes are bad yes

763
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:46,000
exactly and so there's a reason because

764
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,840
a

765
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,240
they don't know what's causing chronic

766
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,360
illness so that's the thing there too

767
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,600
because they don't know what's causing

768
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:56,799
chronic illness they need to blame

769
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:59,840
you you're the to blame it's you

770
00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:02,880
you're the problem so your daughter

771
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:06,400
your son their genes are bad

772
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:09,760
they get one condition colitis crohn's

773
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:12,559
celiac eczema psoriasis

774
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,960
anything anything any kind of condition

775
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:14,640
that

776
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,640
your daughter your son might get or your

777
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:19,679
kids or your grandkids may get

778
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,320
their genes are bad so it's it's it's

779
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:24,559
beyond

780
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:28,080
evil and twisted it's way beyond that

781
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:30,960
um and so what happens is this is that

782
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,720
you're led to believe now every time you

783
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:35,360
have a problem

784
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,760
that your genes are mutated they want

785
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:40,240
you

786
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:44,640
to believe that you you are the cause

787
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:47,600
of your children's mutated genes

788
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,000
you hear that that's what they want

789
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,320
that's

790
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,279
exactly what they want that's their

791
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:54,159
think tank

792
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:55,120
that's their agenda they need you to

793
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:59,679
believe

794
00:27:55,120 --> 00:28:03,279
that your children are faulty

795
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:07,039
they're not perfect no they're not

796
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:07,600
they're not special no their genes are

797
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:10,159
all

798
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:13,039
bad they want you to know that's what

799
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:16,640
they want you to believe

800
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:18,159
they need you to believe this okay

801
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:20,399
and then they need you to believe that

802
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:20,960
your children's children's genes are

803
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:24,640
going to be

804
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:27,520
worse and they're going to be bad

805
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:30,559
they need you to believe that too and so

806
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:32,159
what happens is you get older

807
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:33,679
you're and you get older and your

808
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:36,399
children get older

809
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:37,760
and your children have children it's

810
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:38,480
going to be way worse than this you're

811
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,440
going to see it

812
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,840
more and more and more and more you guys

813
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:45,679
are all

814
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:46,480
genetically ruined you're all

815
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:50,320
genetically

816
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:52,640
faulty that's where it's going

817
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,600
that's where they need it to go and the

818
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,600
alternative movement

819
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:57,200
is following suit now here's something

820
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,640
to understand the alternative movements

821
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,480
not the alternate movement anymore

822
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,760
they're in bed with the conventional

823
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:05,279
movement

824
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,679
get that information in here let it sink

825
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:08,720
in

826
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:10,240

for you not to only think your genes are

831
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:22,080

doctor is saying it's genetic i got a

867
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,080
gene mutation my child's got a gene

868
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,840
mutation

869
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:37,520
and you're just gonna believe it it

870
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:40,720
destroys it destroys the

871
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:42,320
the center of your consciousness without

872
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:45,679
you even knowing it

873
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:48,640
it is poison

874
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:49,039
poison in your veins but it's poison in

875
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,799
your

876
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:56,640
soul on a deep deep dark

877
00:30:52,799 --> 00:31:00,799
level and it's set up that way purposely

878
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:04,559
so it's not the viruses the epstein bars

879
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:07,600
and the shingles virus hhv-6 hhv7

880
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:08,640
simplex other viruses too sedimental

881
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:12,559
virus it's not the

882
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:14,880
viruses that are causing any problems no

883
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:16,320
it's not the toxic heavy metals the

884
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:19,120
mercury inside your brain

885
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:20,799
giving you anxiety depression ocd the

886
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,279
mercury inside your brain that's giving

887
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:22,880
you

888
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:24,720
all kinds of conditions severe

889
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:28,880
depression depersonalization

890
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:31,679
bipolar mania schizophrenia it's not

891
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,000
that metal causing any problems no it's

892
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:33,600
not

893
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,440
at all it's not the pesticides

894
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,960
herbicides fungicides you breathe in

895
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,559
every single day out there

896
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,320
that's on your neighbor's lawn around

897
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:41,760
everybody's apartment buildings and on

898
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,519
the sides of the highway as you've got

899
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:45,519
your windows rolled down

900
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:47,120
it's not those toxic chemicals it's not

901
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:48,640
the petrochemicals you breathe in at the

902
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,399
gas station every single

903
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,159
time you're there filling your tank it's

904
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:53,600
not the plastic that's filling into your

905
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:55,919
body every single day

906
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:57,200
it's none of this it's not the radiation

907
00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:00,640
that's falling out of the sky

908
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:03,440
since hiroshima and fukushima

909
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,960
it's not it's not like that radiation

910
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:08,159
that's raining down

911
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:10,240
on us it's not you know

912
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:12,240
it's not any of the chemical warfare

913
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,840
that's being dropped on us out there on

914
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,360
planes

915
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:17,039
it's not the pharmaceuticals that have

916
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,960
been in her system with all that

917
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:21,039
titanium in it

918
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,399
and all those metals and it's not any of

919
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:25,200
those pharmaceuticals no

920
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:26,720
it's none of that it's not the ddt that

921
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,000
we still breathe in every day because

922
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,320
guess what they didn't ban

923
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,760
ddt it's still being used every day out

924
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:33,519
there and it's floating around

925
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:35,279
everywhere you go outside you're like

926
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:38,960
you breathe it right in

927
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:40,480
it's not any of this all over the world

928
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,960
the ddt is just floating around

929
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:45,200
everywhere and

930
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:47,360
and it's not it's not the travel on the

931
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:49,679
planes and all the radiation on plane

932
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:54,159
flights that are longer than an hour

933
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:57,200
it's not that it's not the oil spills

934
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:58,720
in the in the oceans it's not all the

935
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,399
crap in the oceans

936
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,000
that you actually get on your skin when

937
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:03,679
you're doing like a swim

938
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,279
it's none of that it's none of that it's

939
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:09,200
your genes

940
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:12,480
that's what it is how does it feel

941
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,799
right how does it feel it's your body

942
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,360
you're

943
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:17,039
faulty you're no good i thought we were

944
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,640
like spiritually evolved i thought

945
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:19,760
alternative doctors were spiritually

946
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,720
evolved but don't mean they're

947
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,320
spiritually evolved

948
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:24,559
you can be an alternative doctor but it

949
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:26,399
don't mean crap

950
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:28,000
about spiritual growth and spiritual

951
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:30,720
evolvement

952
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,519
and you can be a conventional doctor

953
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,880
don't mean you're

954
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:36,399
spiritually growing you know and

955
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,360
every time i throw the truth out there

956
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:38,000
and that's what i've been doing all

957
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,600
these years all

958
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,159
you hear is smack about me and

959
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:44,880
everything because of it because

960
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:46,559
no one likes to hear it they don't want

961
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,559
if you actually have been doing

962
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:49,360
something your whole life or believing

963
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:51,200
in something

964
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,720
you think you want to be proved wrong

965
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,679
when you invested all this time and

966
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,440
energy in it

967
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:57,600
when you invested time and energy in it

968
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,640
you think you want the truth to stand in

969
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:01,279
your way when you

970
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,919
already told everybody what you believed

971
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:03,760
in did

972
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:06,240
everything you believe in what your work

973
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:07,679
is and then it just people try to defend

974
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,599
it with their life they

975
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:11,200
they push away the truth to defend

976
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:12,639
whatever they've been doing because what

977
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:14,159
they've been doing is basically

978
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:16,079
fraudulent

979
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:17,760
and that's what happens when you put

980
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:19,359
truth out there so when you put truth

981
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,599
out there about the genes

982
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:23,280
and about how literally they want your

983
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:24,879
children to believe their genes are

984
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:27,040
messed up you know what children do

985
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:29,599
children teenagers though i hear this

986
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:32,240
from moms i hear this from doctors

987
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:33,359
that tell me that their their mom

988
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:36,480
patients

989
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:38,480
their kids 15 16 17 years old are

990
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,919
on the computer after their diagnosis

991
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,320
from the doctor's office and they're

992
00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:42,560
being

993
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,760
in the computer on the internet it says

994
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:46,079
you got a gene

995
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:47,440
problem you know it's genetic and you

996
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:49,599
got like people

997
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:51,839
i hear it all the time from doctors that

998
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:55,599
don't believe in the whole gene thing

999
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:59,040
thank god there's some out there and

1000
00:34:55,599 --> 00:35:03,520
they see the damage being done there's

1001
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:07,200
it's a technique it's a weaponization

1002
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:09,359
to make sure we believe

1003
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,560
we're not only faulty as human beings

1004
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:13,760
physically

1005
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:16,880
physically but we're destroying

1006
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:18,720
the planet in a way where we're making

1007
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:21,760
our offspring

1008
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:24,079
is is broken

1009
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,599
they want you to believe as a mom well i

1010
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:26,079
don't know if i should have a baby

1011
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:27,920
because

1012
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:29,119
if i have a baby and the baby's gonna

1013
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,920
have all these genetic

1014
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:33,440
all these genetic issues what am i going

1015
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:36,480
to do this is not good and then

1016
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:37,119
and then it's only getting worse it's a

1017
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,839
sick

1018
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:41,440
sick evil plot that's just part of it

1019
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:43,599
i'm not even going into the rest of it

1020
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:46,560
there's lots of there's lots of reasons

1021
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:49,280
why it's a sick evil plot

1022
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:51,920
um ruthie says i followed the medical

1023
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:53,839
medium thyroid healing for a nodule when

1024
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:57,280
i went back to the endocrinologist for

1025
00:35:53,839 --> 00:36:00,000
ultrasound follow-up he said it shrank

1026
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,800
and looked at me in awe and said what

1027
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,560
did you do

1028
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:09,200
i told a medical medium ruthie amazing

1029
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:13,760
amazing incredible so

1030
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:16,000
um look so when it comes down to genes

1031
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,200
and genes being weaponized that's what's

1032
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,000
happening right now

1033
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:21,440
and now they're weaponizing science so

1034
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,960
let's talk about that a little bit

1035
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,000
you know you guys if you just came on

1036
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,280
here before i talk about the whole

1037
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,720
weaponizing science

1038
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,400
which you guys might want to hear right

1039
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:30,480
here um

1040
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,760
i'm making the healing broth it's

1041
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,599
cooking

1042
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:36,400
right here so i'll show you what it

1043
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:36,400
looks like a little bit

1044
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:42,320
this is the healing broth um

1045
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:43,760
so i got carrots in there i got celery i

1046
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,119
got onions this is the medical meme

1047
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,000
healing broth that's helped so many

1048
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:47,680
people

1049
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,119
uh in this time of year depending on

1050
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:51,839
where you are in the world it's a great

1051
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:51,839
time for this

1052
00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:55,839
so

1053
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:01,119
and what i'm going to be doing is on ig

1054
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,560
and tiktok i'm going to be on that those

1055
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:04,320
platforms at the same time i'm going to

1056
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:05,599
make the sweet potato soup so you might

1057
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,040
want to go from here to

1058
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:09,520
there and the healing bra is going to be

1059
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:13,040
the base for it so

1060
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:16,640
we'll talk about weaponizing science

1061
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:21,040
they want the young people to believe

1062
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:24,160
that science is everything that science

1063
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:26,079
is all knowing that science is not

1064
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:28,800
flawed on any level

1065
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:29,680
that's what they need young people

1066
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:32,000
growing up

1067
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:33,760
right now they need them to believe that

1068
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:37,119
science

1069
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:39,280
is flawless that

1070
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:40,480
science doesn't have anything wrong with

1071
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:43,040
it at all

1072
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:44,560
and there's a technique for that there's

1073
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:46,000
a reason why they're doing this this why

1074
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:47,599
you'll see all over the internet you'll

1075
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,119
see all these people and all these

1076
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:50,400
trolls and clones that call them and

1077
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:52,160
they'll just be out there

1078
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,920
and they'll just be like where's where's

1079
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:55,200
the science what about this science

1080
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:57,040
study what about that

1081
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:58,640
and there's a lot of issues around this

1082
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:01,680
that i got to tell you that's really

1083
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:04,079
important to know like to begin with

1084
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:06,000
science studies hasn't fixed anyone with

1085
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:06,800
chronic illness so a science study can't

1086
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,640
fix you

1087
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:10,560
you can read all the science studies you

1088
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:12,079
want but it's not going to get somebody

1089
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,839
better that's really struggling or on

1090
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:14,800
mattress island or couch island so

1091
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:17,359
that's number one

1092
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:18,079
so kind of like put that put that in the

1093
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:20,400
database

1094
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:22,880
it's important to know and what they

1095
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:24,560
want everybody to do is they want

1096
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,640
people to believe that there's a

1097
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:29,839
scientific study

1098
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:32,480
waiting to heal them or waiting to

1099
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:32,880
cure them the word that they all use out

1100
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,839
there

1101
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:38,160
right and they believe that there's just

1102
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:38,560
gonna be this miracle scientific study

1103
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:41,440
that's

1104
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:43,200
just around the corner it's right around

1105
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:45,280
the corner you guys

1106
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:46,240
and they want you to be a dog waiting

1107
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,720
for a bone

1108
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:50,160
they want us all like dogs okay that's

1109
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:52,400
what they want us to be like

1110
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:54,400
so we're just dogs waiting for a bone

1111
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,960
we're like where's my bone where's my

1112
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,200
bone

1113
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:58,960
oh wait a minute two years later another

1114
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,320
scientific study can come out is it

1115
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,839
going to save my life

1116
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:03,920
is another scientific study going to

1117
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:06,880
come out i mean there's people been sick

1118
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:09,119
30 40 years with chronic fatigue and no

1119
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,839
scientific studies come out has ever

1120
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:11,119
helped them

1121
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:13,599
there's people with hashimoto's

1122
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:14,960
thyroiditis the worst eczema psoriasis

1123
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:16,960
no scientific study

1124
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:18,400
is going to take care of them there's

1125
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:20,800
people with multiple sclerosis no

1126
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,640
scientific studies going to help them

1127
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,800
there's people with all these different

1128
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:26,640
conditions and they're waiting

1129
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,560
tingles and numbness aches and pains

1130
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,040
burning skin ringing in the ears there's

1131
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:31,119
no time

1132
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:33,680
science to scientific study that's going

1133
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:37,760
to go and save somebody with any of that

1134
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:40,560
and you know what's funny is is that

1135
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:41,119
so we're we have to sit there waiting

1136
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:44,400
for

1137
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:47,040
these scientific studies as if

1138
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:49,040
they're like frosting at the mouth as if

1139
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:51,920
this scientific study

1140
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:52,480
is gonna be the saving grace somewhere

1141
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:56,320
and

1142
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:58,240
here's the thing

1143
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:59,839
everybody's always saying where's your

1144
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:01,680
scientific proof where's your study

1145
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:04,000
where's your peer review study well

1146
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:04,800
or oh i'm gonna or i'm gonna link this

1147
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,280
study here

1148
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:08,319
go check out this study that's not gonna

1149
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:10,640
fix anybody

1150
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:12,480
you can link and check out every study

1151
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:14,160
you want to check out out there every

1152
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:16,000
scientific study out there

1153
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:17,520
and it's not going to fix anybody with

1154
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,880
psoriasis or eczema

1155
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,960
it's not going to fix somebody with

1156
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:23,599
lupus it's not going to fix somebody

1157
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:25,520
with any kind of condition

1158
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:27,280
so that's something to know right there

1159
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:30,839
but they want you

1160
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:34,240
to believe and they want the younger

1161
00:40:30,839 --> 00:40:37,200
generation to believe

1162
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:38,560
wholeheartedly etched in their soul

1163
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,280
their mind their consciousness their

1164
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:42,640
whole being

1165
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:46,480
they want them to believe that science

1166
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:49,839
is a religion science is a god

1167
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:51,119
science is above god science is even

1168
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:53,440
bigger than that

1169
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:55,119
you can't mess with science and so that

1170
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:57,440
leads me to the next part i want to talk

1171
00:40:55,119 --> 00:41:01,119
to you about with this okay

1172
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:04,640
so here's okay perfect

1173
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:05,119
g says um i think the comment i want to

1174
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:08,480
say

1175
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:12,160
we wouldn't have cell phones okay

1176
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:14,160
and physics right so here's the thing

1177
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:15,359
science and chronic illness is not that

1178
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:18,240
science

1179
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:19,839
just so you know you that's the ploy

1180
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:21,200
that's the trick out and that's the next

1181
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:23,119
part i was going into

1182
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:24,400
you look at your cell phone i got mine

1183
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:26,720
over here

1184
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,599
whoa science is going really amazing

1185
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,200
look at this

1186
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:31,839
i could text somebody from around the

1187
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:33,359
world wait hello oh my god science is

1188
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:34,160
incredible i can hear somebody at the

1189
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:36,880
end of this phone

1190
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,599
because science is ingenious you can't

1191
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,280
mess with that

1192
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:40,720
wait i could send emails through my

1193
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:43,680
phone whoa emails

1194
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:45,920
emails that's science right that kind of

1195
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:48,800
technology isn't what i'm talking about

1196
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:50,960
okay that kind of technology is not

1197
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:53,040
science and chronic illness

1198
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:54,640
all right okay how about this science do

1199
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,599
you like this science how about this

1200
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:59,520
okay

1201
00:41:55,599 --> 00:42:03,520
all right in the 1940s the 1950s

1202
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:05,520
the 1960s the 1970s

1203
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:07,680
if you were a girl and you had a little

1204
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:10,319
bit of anxiety and you were 20

1205
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:12,160
if you were 18 19 if you were 15 if you

1206
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:15,760
were 28

1207
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:18,319
young women 28 25 if you

1208
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:19,040
had a little bit of anxiety you were

1209
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:21,920
eligible

1210
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:24,079
for a lobotomy and guess what hundreds

1211
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,319
and hundreds and hundreds of thousands

1212
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:27,040
of

1213
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:27,680
young women had a probe stuck up their

1214
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:30,560
nose

1215
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:31,200
and the front of their brain tore off

1216
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:35,680
and

1217
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:38,000
taken out of through their nasal cavity

1218
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:38,880
just to see if it will treat their

1219
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,520
science

1220
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:43,280
their start treat their anxiety or any

1221
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:45,520
other kind of emotional

1222
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:46,800
problem they were having that was

1223
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:50,000
science at its

1224
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:51,200
best then it was indisputable because it

1225
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,839
was science

1226
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:55,599
okay it was indisputable because it was

1227
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:59,280
science how would you like to be

1228
00:42:55,599 --> 00:43:00,319
there in 1965 and have the front of your

1229
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:02,160
brain removed

1230
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:04,000
and now you don't even know your name

1231
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:05,200
and you just sit in a rocking chair for

1232
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,440
the rest of your life

1233
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:09,680
for no reason and that was science how

1234
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:13,359
about that

1235
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:17,040
because science knew all and science

1236
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:17,839
never gets slapped it never gets smacked

1237
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:21,920
it never gets

1238
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:24,079
punished it's ruined millions of lives

1239
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:25,359
millions of lives millions of girls

1240
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:27,599
lives okay

1241
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:29,520
that's one example let's go into lyme

1242
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:33,040
disease so science is so

1243
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:34,720
great in the 1980s in the late 1970s and

1244
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:38,400
1980s

1245
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:41,920
and 1990s and 2000s

1246
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:44,400
hundreds of thousands of women have

1247
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:45,200
not only lost their lives in different

1248
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:49,280
ways

1249
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:51,839
including died from antibiotic overuse

1250
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:54,560
from being diagnosed with lyme disease

1251
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:58,079
and being treated wrong

1252
00:43:54,560 --> 00:44:01,200
lives destroyed awake you guys

1253
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:02,400
don't even know or realize but wait a

1254
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:05,680
minute

1255
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:06,720
um couldn't have uh couldn't have a good

1256
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:08,560
cell connection

1257
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:10,319
couldn't have a good tv connection

1258
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:12,240
couldn't be watching all different

1259
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:13,760
all the different tv shows you can watch

1260
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:16,319
or anything you want to do

1261
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:19,760
i get it your car is totally decked out

1262
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:19,760
you got wi-fi in your car

1263
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:26,960
but that's the trick out the trick out

1264
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:28,240
is that the young people they see all

1265
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:29,599
this technology

1266
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:31,359
and they think science has got them

1267
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:33,520
covered all the way

1268
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:35,119
without a doubt science is everything i

1269
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:36,880
have nothing against science i believe

1270
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:39,359
in science

1271
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:40,640
but when it comes down to chronic

1272
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:43,200
illness

1273
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:44,079
no science is let out of the gate that

1274
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:47,280
really can

1275
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:49,599
fix people and that's done on purpose

1276
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:51,440
see look around you do you think there's

1277
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:52,800
anything bad going on around there

1278
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:55,440
around the world do you think there's

1279
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:57,359
anything bad going on do you think

1280
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:58,880
there's bad going on with the pollution

1281
00:44:57,359 --> 00:45:00,400
what's your fight what's your

1282
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:02,240
what's your thought out there what are

1283
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:03,680
you thinking out there like what's going

1284
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:06,800
bad in the world to you

1285
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:09,280
okay where is it is it

1286
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:11,440
you know people's rights are you worried

1287
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:13,839
about people having rights

1288
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:15,680
are you worried about racism are you

1289
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:18,000
worried about rights issues

1290
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:18,720
are you worried about oil spilled in the

1291
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,480
in

1292
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:25,359
in in the oceans are you worried about

1293
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,680
what like what's your fight like what is

1294
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:27,920
it

1295
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:28,720
that you're that you're fighting for

1296
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:30,960
because

1297
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:32,560
we know the world is corrupt we know the

1298
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:34,560
world is messed up

1299
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:37,280
we know that there's all these bad

1300
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:39,920
things happening in the world right

1301

1309
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:54,560
you know i'm worried about racism

1310
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:56,640
another person will say

1311
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:58,000

1312
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:59,599
chemicals in our ocean

1313
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,200
another person is like i'm worried about

1314
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:02,720
the great garbage patch out in the

1315
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:06,000
pacific ocean

1316
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:08,079
where it's the size of texas and it's

1317
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,839
eating up wildlife and all these birds

1318
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:11,280
are swallowing all this plastic

1319
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:12,400
and that's what i'm worried about i

1320
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:13,680
talked to somebody else and they're

1321
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,079
worried about all these little plastic

1322
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:16,319
straws

1323
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:17,520
and bottles in the ocean and then i

1324
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:19,040
talked to somebody else they're worried

1325
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:21,440
about a polluted lake

1326
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:23,680
and then we're you know like everybody's

1327
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:27,040
like worried about something right

1328
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:29,760
and so we know the world's messed up

1329
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:30,319
you know the world's messed up right and

1330
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:34,720
then

1331
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:37,680
but science isn't oh wait wait a minute

1332
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:40,839
science isn't you mean to tell me that

1333
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:45,839
there's no bad people in science

1334
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:49,920
i you mean to tell me wait a minute

1335
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:51,520
there's no bad anything in science

1336
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:53,119
i'm confused that's a head scratcher for

1337
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:56,319
me all right like

1338
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:59,280
so there's angels

1339
00:46:56,319 --> 00:47:00,079
so everybody in science they're angels

1340
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:02,720
uh

1341
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:03,760
right they're holy angels is that who's

1342
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:06,720
in science

1343
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:08,319
so every single man in science is a holy

1344
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:11,200
angel

1345
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:12,160
that could do no wrong is that what it

1346
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:14,400
is

1347
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:15,280
like okay so i'm because i'm scratching

1348
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,880
my head so

1349
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:18,960
all the scientists there's not one bad

1350
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:20,240
person at a lot so all the millions of

1351
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:22,160
scientists around the world

1352
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:24,319
they're all telling the truth there's

1353
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:26,319
not one that lies oh wait

1354
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:28,240
there's not one scientist that's a bad

1355
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:29,359
person that doesn't beat their wife when

1356
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:31,920
they come home

1357
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:32,720
um there's no there's not one scientist

1358
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:35,520
that hasn't

1359
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:36,720
there's not one science scientist that

1360
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:39,040
hasn't like

1361
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:42,240

00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:44,720
perfect every single person is perfect

1363
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:46,319
in science wait a minute the scientific

1364
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:49,440
community is perfect

1365
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:53,920

00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:57,280
um interesting wait a minute um

1367
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:59,760
the people that pay and hire scientists

1368
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:00,480
and the people that pay for science to

1369
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:02,640
be done

1370
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:04,079
oh they can't do no wrong either so the

1371
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:06,000
funders of science

1372
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:07,599
can't do no wrong so you mean to tell me

1373
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:11,200

bad funder of science the biggest

1376
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:18,640
industries out there that are paying for

1377
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:20,480
all the scientific studies

1378
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:22,480
you mean to tell me that every one of

1379
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,680
those big industries that are paying for

1380
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:26,800
scientific studies

1381
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:29,440
haven't done one thing wrong at all

1382
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:30,559
i didn't know it's all perfect out there

1383
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:32,319
science is perfect

1384
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:34,079
the people who pay for scientific

1385
00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:36,559
studies are perfect the medical

1386
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:37,119
industry is perfect everything's perfect

there's no interests involved

1390
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:46,960
i didn't know because i don't know what

1391
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:49,440
world

1392
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:51,040
everybody's living in about thinking

1393
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,520
that all you got to say is the word

1394
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:54,559
science

1395
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:55,440
hey uh yeah um is there any science with

1396
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:57,040
that because

1397
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:59,440
all i got to do is we'll use that word

1398
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:01,599
science hey pal um

1399
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:04,720
that's science word and then we're all

1400
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:07,359
clear whoa he said science whoa

1401
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:08,720
wait wait a study whoa wait what study

1402
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:10,559
because that can't be wrong

1403
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:12,000
that scientific study can't be wrong

1404
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:16,960
there can't be anything wrong with

1405
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:20,240
it um

1406
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:23,359
science says asbestos was

1407
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:24,800
fine and safe and then we got like

1408
00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:26,559
millions of people around the world

1409
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:27,599
dying from asbestos cancer in their

1410
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:30,160
lungs

1411
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:32,079
science said cigarettes were fine for us

1412
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:35,280
they were actually great for us

1413
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:36,800
science says that that mesh they stuck

1414
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:39,280
in for hernias

1415
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:41,040
was perfectly fine they did all the math

1416
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:42,640
they did all the science they made this

1417
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:44,559
really nice mesh that you can put in

1418
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:45,680
your abdomen and there's a billion

1419
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:47,440
lawsuits

1420
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:49,440
science said those lobotomies for all

1421
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:50,960
those girls ruined

1422
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:53,599
millions of lives actually around the

1423
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:55,440
planet they lay a girl on a table

1424
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:56,640
they knock her out and they stick a

1425
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:58,960
probe up her nose

1426
00:49:56,640 --> 00:50:01,119
and they pull the front of her brain off

1427
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:03,440
that i don't think that didn't happen

1428
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:04,240
and science said that the lyme disease

1429
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:06,640
treatments

1430
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:08,480
for all those women that literally has

1431
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:09,200
killed so many of them and you can't

1432
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:11,119
talk about it

1433
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:13,119
you talk about it anywhere and everybody

1434
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:15,280
gets silenced because you can't go

1435
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:17,440
against science because science is god

1436
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:20,319
and they need every single person

1437
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:20,880
to be science brainwashed like it's it's

1438
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:23,040
more than

1439
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:24,240
kool-aid it's like here's the kool-aid

1440
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:25,760
the science kool-aid

1441
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:27,680
once you drink that science kool-aid

1442
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:30,640
like whoa and what they do is

1443
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:32,559
they're teaching the youth that boy

1444
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:35,280
science is amazing like

1445
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:36,720
all the technology you got going on you

1446
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:39,599
know

1447
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:40,720
it's incredible science has become

1448
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:42,960
weaponized

1449
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:44,480
so that's what's happening there it's

1450
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:46,880
become weaponized

1451
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:47,599
and that's what's going on with science

1452
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:51,119
it's

1453
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:54,240
the beyond a new religion it's

1454
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:57,040
beyond all of that it's

1455
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:58,160
it's actually like a training a

1456
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:01,200
conditioning

1457
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:04,640
that's happening so

1458
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:08,559
you actually believe that science

1459
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:11,680
in medicine is above

1460
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:14,480
board can't do no wrong

1461
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:15,359
nothing can happen and it's free of

1462
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:17,119
corruption

1463
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:19,200
you know there's corruption everywhere

1464
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:20,880
else right i just told you all those

1465
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:22,880
different things like what's your fight

1466
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:25,680
what's your worry what's your concern

1467
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:26,640
because that's where this you know you

1468
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:29,040
know

1469
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:30,640
about all this corruption out there you

1470
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:31,920
guys are out there you see it you guys

1471
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:33,599
are on the internet you see different

1472
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:34,960
things that you know about you guys

1473
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:36,400
look into things you guys know

1474
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:38,319
corruption but there's no corruption in

1475
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:41,520
science no whoa

1476
00:51:38,319 --> 00:51:44,160
whoa all those paid for studies

1477
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:45,200
paid and funded no thumb on the scale

1478
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:48,160
right

1479
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:48,960
you know what i know a lot of scientists

1480
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:51,119
because

1481
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:53,040
the years of the work that i've done and

1482
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:54,160
bringing so much information out there

1483
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:56,079
to others so i know

1484
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:57,680
a lot of scientists and guess what they

1485
00:51:56,079 --> 00:52:01,040
can't feed their families

1486
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:02,160
if they don't produce an outcome if you

1487
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:05,119
don't produce an

1488
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:06,160
outcome to the funder that's actually

1489
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:08,720
hiring you

1490
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:10,640
and that outcome doesn't suit the funder

1491
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:12,800
then guess what you never work again

1492
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:15,359
and you never get hired by another

1493
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:17,440
funder another company won't hire you

1494
00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:18,880
so guess what that's the last job you

1495
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:21,599
work you're going to be working

1496
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:21,599
somewhere else

1497
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:26,559
a scientist friend of mine said it was

1498
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:29,119
either working at mcdonald's

1499
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:30,480
or you better come up with something

1500
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:32,000
whether you got to pull it out of your

1501
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:34,160
ass you better come up with something

1502
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:36,319
because when you're getting funded and

1503
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:38,480
that's a corporation that's funding you

1504
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:40,240
and you're like oh crap i gotta come up

1505
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:42,400
with something on this table

1506
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:44,319
let me get the chemistry out let me get

1507
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:45,280
my theories going here because i better

1508
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:48,240
come up with something

1509
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:49,440
and if you botch it up you get a bad

1510
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:52,160
recommendation

1511
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:54,480
that corporation doesn't want to refer

1512
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:56,240
you as a scientist anymore to another

1513
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:57,440
corporation to keep you going so you

1514
00:52:56,240 --> 00:53:01,119
could feed your family

1515
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:02,559
and now now you're working for like a

1516
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:03,839
car service and you're driving people

1517
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:04,640
around and they're in the back seat of

1518
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:08,079
your car

1519
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:10,400
when you were the scientist before

1520
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:14,720
even though that's it's all good i mean

1521
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:15,280
whatever you do is great you guys know i

1522
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:18,480
talk about

1523
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:22,160
medical medium book what

1524
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:25,599
i did growing up and you guys should

1525
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:30,480
read the origins of medical medium

1526
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:30,480
when i was 14 and 15 i used to pump gas

1527
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:39,760
medical science doesn't

1528
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:41,520
get called out so it never gets called

1529
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:42,400
out it makes mistake after mistake after

1530
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:44,640
mistake

1531
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:46,559
it's your genes it's the biggest mistake

1532
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:48,640
ever but it doesn't matter it'll never

1533
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:49,680
get called out you'll buy it you'll buy

1534
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:51,760
into it

1535
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:52,800
you know anything that has the word

1536
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:56,079
science now

1537
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:57,119
and forget it it's platinum gold you

1538
00:53:56,079 --> 00:54:00,640
can't

1539
00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:02,000
you can't go near it it's diamonds and

1540
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:03,760
they'll tell your body's attacking

1541
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,240
itself so when you got hashimoto's and

1542
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:07,760
you got

1543
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:09,599
ra and you got multiple sclerosis and

1544
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:10,160
you got fibromyalgia you got cfs and

1545
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:11,440
you've got

1546
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:12,960
all kinds of other problems they're

1547
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:14,480
going to tell you your body's attacking

1548
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:15,359
itself because science wants to blame

1549
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:18,559
your body

1550
00:54:15,359 --> 00:54:20,000
it's body shaming so they want your

1551
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:22,000
children body shamed

1552
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,040
thinking their genes are bad and faulty

1553
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,359
that's a real

1554
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:26,319
hard pill to swallow right there they

1555
00:54:25,359 --> 00:54:27,920
want

1556
00:54:26,319 --> 00:54:30,400
you and your children to believe that

1557
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:31,920
your body's attacking itself

1558
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:33,760
they want you to believe that you have

1559
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:34,559
all these gene mutations and that's why

1560
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:36,079
you're sick

1561
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:37,680
and they want you if you're a woman they

1562
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:38,480
want you to believe it's your hormones a

1563
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:40,160
hundred percent

1564
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:43,119
yeah our hormones are imbalanced and you

1565
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:45,040
you should get a really good doctor

1566
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:47,040
a really good doctor and have them do

1567
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:48,880
some hormone testing absolutely

1568
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:51,200
and they can offer something natural

1569
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:54,720
that can really help

1570
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:57,680
but but they blame science wants

1571
00:54:54,720 --> 00:55:00,640
everything blamed on hormones everything

1572
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:02,640
blamed on hormones

1573
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:03,920
and that's what they want science

1574
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:05,839
doesn't want you to know that it's a

1575
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:07,200
toxic heavy metal against the viruses

1576
00:55:05,839 --> 00:55:08,559
and the shingles virus and the

1577
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:09,920
epstein-barr

1578
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:11,760
and all the different varieties in the

1579
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:13,119
streptococcus and they want

1580
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:14,559
they don't want you knowing the real

1581
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:15,839
problems of why your hormones are

1582
00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:17,520
imbalanced they don't want to look for

1583
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:21,920
the real issues

1584
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:25,839
science doesn't want to do that medical

1585
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:28,079
science you know

1586
00:55:25,839 --> 00:55:30,559
doesn't care about you medical science

1587
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:32,079
looks out for medical science

1588
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:34,640
that's how it works i mean it's

1589
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:36,480
something to keep keep an eye on

1590
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:38,240
you might not believe that now but if

1591
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:40,160
you're somebody that was sick for 25

1592
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:43,520
years already you know that

1593
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:45,520
that's the way it goes the best science

1594
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:47,520
doesn't get people out of bed it doesn't

1595
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:48,000
get people off of mattress island when

1596
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:51,680
it comes

1597
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:53,839
down to chronic illness you know

1598
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:56,400
and the best science and then there's

1599
00:55:53,839 --> 00:55:59,040
this you ready for this you guys

1600
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:59,839
okay here's how it works we need

1601
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:03,760
scientists

1602
00:55:59,839 --> 00:56:04,480
we need science but the best science out

1603
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:07,760
there that has

1604
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:10,880
truth will never be revealed

1605
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:12,079
it will never get a spotlight it will

1606
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:15,359
get squashed

1607
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:18,160
and crushed so if you fund some

1608
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:20,720
scientists to actually discover the real

1609
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:24,000
cause of something

1610
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:24,400
there's going to be literally men in

1611
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,319
black

1612
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:27,839
suits busting down those doors and

1613
00:56:26,319 --> 00:56:30,960
shutting that down

1614
00:56:27,839 --> 00:56:31,520
you can't you can't fund real science in

1615
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:33,599
health

1616
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:35,760
and wellness you can fund science and

1617
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:39,040
technology like i was telling you before

1618
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:41,520
and it and it it going good you can fund

1619
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:43,280
as good as it can you can fund

1620
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:46,079
technology can fund other things

1621
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:47,680
but you can't fund science to fix

1622
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:50,960
problems to really

1623
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:53,359
know to really discover what's wrong

1624
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:54,160
because that stuff will be shut down

1625
00:56:53,359 --> 00:56:57,119
fast

1626
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:58,000
totally shut down because the minute the

1627
00:56:57,119 --> 00:56:59,839
word gets out

1628
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:03,200
there of why people are really sick it

1629
00:56:59,839 --> 00:57:05,040
leads a trail back to where it came from

1630
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:06,960
like the epstein-barr virus it leads a

1631
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:08,559
trail where these viruses really come

1632
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:10,160
from it leads a trail where these toxic

1633
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:12,960
heavy metals come from

1634
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:14,160
and that they can't expose that they

1635
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:16,640
don't want scientists

1636
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:18,720
learning how to heal people either

1637
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:21,839
scientists are not allowed

1638
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:23,040
to find answers and to work in medical

1639
00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:26,640
science and research

1640
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:27,599
to actually heal people to actually heal

1641
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:30,319
people

1642
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:32,000
because if they do that it defies what

1643
00:57:30,319 --> 00:57:32,799
medical research and science is trying

1644
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,880
to do

1645
00:57:32,799 --> 00:57:36,720
they like creating equipment they like

1646
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:40,079
creating things

1647
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:42,559
they like to make things

1648
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:43,119
and um you know they like to make things

1649
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:45,200
and stuff

1650
00:57:43,119 --> 00:57:47,599
so science loves to do that where they

1651
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:48,960
they can put nuts and bolts together

1652
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:51,520
you know they can help you get more

1653
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:52,960
comfortable with like if you have a leg

1654
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:55,440
problem a knee problem they can create

1655
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:56,079
knee braces science works in those areas

1656
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:58,000
right

1657
00:57:56,079 --> 00:57:59,920
mechanical and other things like that

1658
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:01,200
they work with some pharmaceuticals that

1659
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:02,960
can be helpful

1660
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:04,559
because they sell that's the thing it's

1661
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:06,880
all part of that they want to sell all

1662
00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:09,040
that stuff but they don't want

1663
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:10,640
the real reasons why you're sick and how

1664
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:14,160
to head that off at the pass

1665
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:16,240
and how to heal that they don't want

1666
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:19,280
that happening so really good

1667
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:21,839
good science doesn't get its day

1668
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:23,200
it gets crushed every time it wants to

1669
00:58:21,839 --> 00:58:25,520
peek its head out

1670
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:27,520
so hey wait a minute toxic heavy metals

1671
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:29,920
are responsible for these diseases

1672
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:31,200
boom it gets crushed wait a minute this

1673
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:34,240
you you can't go

1674
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:36,240
there that's how it works and then

1675
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:37,520
then there's the fight of two sciences

1676
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:39,760
right you get people

1677
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:41,119
where's your science what science are

1678
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:42,400
you talking about because conventional

1679
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:43,760
science doesn't believe in alternative

1680
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:45,440
science

1681
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:46,960
they don't believe food has any science

1682
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:47,520
involved there's nothing even involved

1683
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:49,040
with food

1684
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:50,400
they don't believe in anything so what

1685
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:52,319
signs are even talking about whose

1686
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:54,240
science are you even on or even talking

1687
00:58:52,319 --> 00:58:56,559
about that's a whole other thing too

1688
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:57,520
and studies are always being trumped on

1689
00:58:56,559 --> 00:58:59,440
studies

1690
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:00,799
like that study is an old study that

1691
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:02,400
studies useless

1692
00:59:00,799 --> 00:59:04,559
and then the new study comes out and

1693
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:07,440
crushes it and then the bias

1694
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:08,000
the bias in studies is a whole other

1695
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:11,599
game

1696
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:12,880
um so yeah yeah yeah susan says forget

1697
00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:15,200
about science right now

1698
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:17,119
okay well you know what there's millions

1699
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:20,079
and millions and millions of kids

1700
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:21,520
that believe science knows everything

1701
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:23,280
about their health

1702
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:25,280
and that their genes are faulty and

1703
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:29,119
their bodies are attacking themselves

1704
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:30,559
and when hey when mom is driving home

1705
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:32,880
from a doctor's appointment

1706
00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:34,640
and she's got her 15 year old son and

1707
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:36,559
he's looking on the computer

1708
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:38,720
and he's finding out his hashimoto's is

1709
00:59:36,559 --> 00:59:42,480
his body destroying his thyroid

1710
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:45,200
it's devastating devastating

1711
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:46,000
because science doesn't have her son's

1712
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:49,440
