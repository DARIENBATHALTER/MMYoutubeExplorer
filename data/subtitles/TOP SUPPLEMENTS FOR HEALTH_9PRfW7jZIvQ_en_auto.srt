1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,760
we're live right now and we're talking

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,160
about the top four

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:08,400
supplements a baseline what does that

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,280
mean it means a foundation a baseline it

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,000
means

6
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,519
the top four with all the different

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,120
autoimmune conditions

8
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,640
all the different issues people have all

9
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,560
the different symptoms the mystery

10
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,199
symptoms the eczema psoriasis which is a

11
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,600
mystery

12
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,880
to medical research and science right to

13
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,359
the ms and

14
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,439
als and tingles numbness aches and pains

15
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,800

migraines whatever right all of it all

18
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,680
of it what

19
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:37,360
is the top four what is the best and

20
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,239
then we'll go after the top four we'll

21
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,480
hit the top

22
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:42,160
eight right so we'll hit the top eight

23
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,239
as well a lot of people say

24
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,160
what am i going to take or what can i

25
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:48,480
take well starting at the top four is a

26
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,480
great place to be it's the foundation

27
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,760
it's the baseline that's what we're

28
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,120
talking about

29
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,640

80
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,480
michelle l good to see you

81
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,080
so glad you guys are coming on now so

82
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:36,640
let's go into it a little bit

83
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:38,720
all right top four right here zinc is

84
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,080
one of them one of the top four really

85
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,360
important right there

86
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,480
so what now here's the thing not every

87
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,920
zinc works

88
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,840
and that's what people don't understand

89
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:51,440
so i wasn't clear

90
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:54,239
perfectly clear as to why i'm so

91
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,879
about vimergy so it wasn't perfectly

92
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,760
clear

93
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:59,200
like how come i'm so about them like

94
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,800
what makes them

95
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:05,120
so different like something mind-blowing

96
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,480
i'll give you this example right here

97
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,680
okay

98
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:12,440
they're the only company that's

99
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,560
has a stabilizer for zinc and

100
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,120
stabilizers is the only way to keep your

101
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,920
zinc

102
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,760
working active and functional so if

103
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,239
vimergy's inc disappeared

104
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,760
and was gone we would have all the other

105
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:27,040
zincs on the market

106
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:30,080
they would not be stabilized very

107
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:33,280
important to know that means their

108
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:35,840
their their ability to work

109
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,640
and do what needs to be done for zinc

110
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,879
lessens

111
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,760
and it could lessen greatly that

112
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:43,680
includes

113
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:46,159
it surviving or even staying stable

114
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,440
and that's how zinc works zinc has to be

115
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:50,000
stabilized

116
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,120
and so when people say oh no i can order

117
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,959
some other zinc

118
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,959
let me look here oh here's a company

119
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:57,519
that that's that's got all about

120
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,120
quality and let me check them out and i

121
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,959
can order that zinc

122
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,400
and what people don't realize those

123
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,720
aren't stabilized

124
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,760
and that's a critical part right there

125
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,879
so

126
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,720
if if vimergy zinc disappeared

127
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,400
i would be like well i don't know what i

128
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,360
would do to be honest i know that all

129
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,040
the other zincs would be

130
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,840
destabilized and that's a difference

131
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,919
right there

132
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,919
that means that it may not last more

133
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:23,199
than a month on the shelf it may not

134
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:25,759
last more than a week after

135
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:28,000
manufacturing like no one knows

136
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,919
because when it's not stabilized

137
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,240
anything goes wrong and so this is just

138
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:33,440
one reason right there that's so

139
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,199
important you guys

140
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,479
we're live on tick tock facebook youtube

141
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,160
clubhouse good to see you guys talk

142
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,840
about the top four

143
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,759
supplements now if you guys don't know

144
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:46,000
about vimergy it's v and victor i

145
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:47,759
am as mary e rgy.com go to vimergy.com

146
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,880
that's the best place to go

147
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:53,040
and i'm not sponsored by these guys okay

148
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,800
this is just the best stuff out there

149
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:58,240
it's what i give family friends

150
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,919
it's what i take myself so you you might

151
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,600
be somebody that's like wow i know this

152
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,440
company that's really good

153
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,600
they put out a zinc they put out a

154
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:08,960
liquid sink sulfate

155
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:12,000
just like vimergy but they did not

156
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:14,400
learn about stabilizing it

157
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,240
and vimergy did and vimergi's only

158
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,320
company learned about stabilizing

159
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,600
so there's there's that alone is just

160
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,520
unbelievable

161
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,280
lisa says i finally decided to throw out

162
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,120
all the crap in my cupboard

163
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,800
and only go with what you currently

164
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,160
recommend such a difference such a

165
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,639
difference at least it's an unbelievable

166
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,000
difference

167
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,479
and that brings me back to the whole

168
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,840
like the whole game that's happening in

169
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:37,039
marketing right now

170
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,000
fulvic acid didn't work you guys don't

171
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:39,600
know the history

172
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,960
and i'll go into that and i'll go into

173
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,520
the rest of the stuff for a second but i

174
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,560
wanna

175
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:47,039
i wanna cut the head off the snake okay

176
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,600
i wanna cut the head off the snake right

177
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,919
now

178
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,759
the reason why medical medium doesn't

179
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:54,800
recommend fulvic acid

180
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:56,160
or humic acid is because they already

181
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,039
tried it on everybody

182
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,400
and it died they tried it on everybody

183
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,639
and it died out

184
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,160
they sold all their expensive marketing

185
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:07,440
a fulvic and humic acid

186
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:10,000
20 years ago and then it died out

187
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,840
because it did nothing for anybody

188
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,520
makers of fulvic acid don't know why

189
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,759

30 years

221
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,520
unless they learn the tools to heal and

222
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,479
then

223
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:20,240
all the different scams were tried they

224
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:23,120
tried the fulvic acid scam

225
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,960
20 years ago 18 years ago and it burned

226
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,759
out because it didn't work and then they

227
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,639
wait

228
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:31,440
they wait to reignite something when

229
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:33,199
when everybody forgets

230
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,479

start with fulvic acid and everybody

260
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:31,280
would buy it

261
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:33,839
but then everybody would get ripped off

262
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:36,399
everybody would get screwed over

263
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,519
because nobody knows it doesn't do

264
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,120
anything

265
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,479

because they didn't been there done that

273
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,519
fulvic acid makers don't know why people

274
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:58,720

275
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:00,160

because i'll tell you what happened

305
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,720
before medical medium everybody took it

306
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,839
by the truckloads and stayed sick and

307
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,440

308
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:08,240
tools siphoned in

309
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,040

everything

311
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,720

let's get rid of all of it and then what

343
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,560
we're gonna have

344
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:12,560
is a keto diet an old keto diet

345
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,640

00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:22,320
you'll have your bentonite clay you'll

350
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:25,279

you'll have all these things right and

354
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,920
then and then see where we are we will

355
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,279
be back to where we were

356
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:37,600
20 years ago oh my god

357
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,480
marianne said i did fulvic in humic acid

358
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,120
it didn't work

359
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,040
it doesn't work what people do is

360
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,399
they're on so many medical medium tools

361
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,519
now even if they don't know it

362
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,560
indirectly

363
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,959
that it's keeping them afloat so they

364
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,880
can

365
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:52,560
they can mess they we can afford to mess

366
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:55,040
up now did you guys know that

367
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,079
like that wasn't like that years ago

368
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,399
michelle l says

369
00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:00,079
did it all she said did it all you can

370
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,680
afford to mess up now

371
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:03,360
because your wild blueberries are saving

372
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,959
you your celery juice is saving you

373
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,720

00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:08,000
these things are saving you

375
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,519
and and that's how it works so let's

376
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,279
move on a little bit don't want to waste

377
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:13,600
your time on this but it's it's in you

378
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:15,040
know it comes up

379
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,720
so let's talk about the zinc a little

380
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:20,480
bit more so

381
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:22,639
the reason why this zinc helps

382
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,399
and it works for the zinc shock therapy

383
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:26,639
and it makes a difference and i'm not

384
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:28,240
sponsored by this company

385
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,760
but they're the only ones that figured

386
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,000
out how to stabilize zinc

387
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,200
and those other companies says i notice

388
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,160
that the bots come

389
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,519
in right the minute medical medium tries

390
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,480
to get people better

391
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:42,000
with information the bots come in they

392
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,480
come in and they start pushing their

393
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,440
zinc

394
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,079
liquid sulfate they start pushing their

395
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,560
stuff

396
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:49,600
but it's destabilized it's not

397
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,000
stabilized

398
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,639
but nobody knows this and here's the

399
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,200
other thing

400
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:57,040
here's the clincher of why here's

401
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,000
another clincher of why vimergy is the

402
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,399
best

403
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,839
here's another clincher you ready for

404
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:04,560
this

405
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:06,240
vimergy knows about something in the

406
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,320
supplement company

407
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,360
supplement company world that'll blow

408
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,560
your mind

409
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:14,639
get ready for this okay all the

410
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,320
supplement companies

411
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:19,760
are allowed to put stuff in their

412
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:23,760
products and not listed on the label

413
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:27,440
if it's a small amount

414
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:31,839
a small amount the reason why

415
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:35,680
i am deadly cautious now

416
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:38,240
about so many companies is because

417
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,839
there's four percent something in there

418
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,680
that's not listed on the ingredient list

419
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:44,560
that nobody knows about

420
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:46,079
there's six percent something listed if

421
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,440
that's in there that's not listed on the

422
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:50,560
ingredient list

423
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:53,839
demergie knows this and they know

424
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:55,120
to stay away from that game that game is

425
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:58,079
real

426
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,519
all the supplement companies have things

427
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:01,519
in there

428
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,199
you'll never know they're not listed on

429
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,199
the ingredients

430
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:06,240
so when you say your favorite stuff i

431
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:09,440
love this

432
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:11,680
i love that that's going on out there

433
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,120
there is portions of things that they

434
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,720
don't have to list in the ingredient

435
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,440
list

436
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,040
and that right there is a mind blower so

437
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,720
when people say oh he's just

438
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,399
he just likes to take what he takes so

439
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,839
he's gonna of course back it up and

440
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:26,240
stand behind it no

441
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:27,839
it's more than that and i don't go into

442
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,600
this nitty-gritty

443
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:32,079
i don't but it's time to go into this

444
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,279
neighborhood helpful is it's awful

445
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,519
you couldn't believe you couldn't

446
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:37,920
believe they don't have to list it

447
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:40,160
there's a there's a law in

448
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:42,880

00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:46,480
nitty-gritty let's expose

483
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,279
the crap out there and that's one reason

484
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,560
why i back

485
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:51,440
them orgy because they're like they tell

486
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,560
they're the worst

487
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,600
nightmare for suppliers they're like you

488
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,279
ain't sticking

489
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,920
you ain't sticking small amounts of

490
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:01,920
something in our product

491
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,920
you can do that to every other company

492
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,040
like you do you're not doing it here so

493
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:08,079
that's one thing right there

494
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,440
really important okay so let's

495
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,720
you know it's just like fragrances they

496
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,519
don't list the ingredients of a

497
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,040
fragrance

498
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,720
well supplement companies do something

499
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:17,360
similar to this all of them do

500
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,399
the manufacturers all do this so that's

501
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,680
one thing right there so

502
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:24,160
anything you guys take that for

503
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,880
like some info that's really important

504
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:30,240
just go to another thing that's critical

505
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:32,000
all right vimergy knows medical medium

506
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,240
standards

507
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,040
so when you go to another liquid zinc

508
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,440
sulfate

509
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:39,040
when you go to another b12 they don't

510
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:42,240
care about

511
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:44,560
mm standards the owners of

512
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,079
those companies don't care about medical

513
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,440
medium standards

514
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,880
you guys care about medical medium

515
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,000
standards because you know it's the best

516
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,079
it's what got people better

517
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,360
all these years right you guys care

518
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:56,720
about medical medium

519
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,680
standards they don't let me go oh whoa

520
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,880
the bots are out

521
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:02,399
tried sb12 try this b12 that b12 company

522
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,160
doesn't care about medical medium

523
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,600
standards but you think they

524
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,839
they're all you think they're all

525
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:11,120
plugged into medical medium standards

526
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:14,720
like some weird some angel fairy

527
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:16,240
some magical spell was cast upon all the

528
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,280
other supplements

529
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:22,720
for them to care about medical medium

530
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:26,000
standards no

531
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:28,319
no it's just they don't care

532
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,440
they don't care and these are

533
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,840
differences

534
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,360
for someone who's really sick and they

535
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:35,360
don't care

536
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,440
you can sell not you can sell

537
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,760
supplements to people all day long to

538
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,679
not so sick people

539
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:44,240
but when people are really sick it's

540
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:45,600
make or break a stabilized zinc is make

541
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,760
or break

542
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,640
right the right kind of b12 is make or

543
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,120
break

544
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,240
right these things are make or break

545
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,799
okay

546
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,919
a spirulina that's not from the pacific

547
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,960
ocean

548
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:01,280
is make or break right

549
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,760
a spirulina that doesn't have a random

550
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:07,200
piece of mysterious plastic in it

551
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:10,160
from the pacific spirulinas companies

552
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,760
is make or break all these things matter

553
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,039
when you're really sick

554
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:16,000
and these are just something so let's

555
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:18,000
move along there's more stuff too

556
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,600

00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,799
know i can't afford much right now or i

563
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,280
can't afford

564
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:32,880
something what do i do well i look at

565
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,039
the top four so if i was in that

566
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,000
situation right and i couldn't afford a

567
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:38,000
supplement

568
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,320
i would be like well you know i would go

569
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,679
with one of the top four

570
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,520
that's what i would do and here it takes

571
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:46,400
me to the next place too

572
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,799
what happens is they also get you out

573
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,360
there

574
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,919
where it's like let me go and buy this

575
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:55,039
really

576
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:58,559
really cheap junkie product out there

577
00:18:55,039 --> 00:19:02,000
or two products out there that won't

578
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:03,360
help me heal when i can actually get a

579
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,280
high quality product can make a

580
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,480
difference so that thing happens all the

581
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,600
time

582
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:11,039
you know and and that's something to

583
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,400
think about

584
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,960
so then we'll talk about like other

585
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:19,120
stuff so what i love about

586
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:22,880
you know what i love about vimergy too

587
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:26,160
is they don't use

588
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:28,160
palm glycerin key let's go there

589
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,400
okay so i got a lemon balm right here

590
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:34,640
right here's a cat's claw right here

591
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:37,440
okay glycerin glycerin in here right

592
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,080
they don't use the palm glycerin now i'm

593
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,600
in the top

594
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:44,400
four okay you guys i'm in the top four

595
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,760
right palm glycerin isn't the worst

596
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,799
thing in the world

597
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:51,679
it's not i'm not sitting here

598
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:52,880
hating on it like it's the worst thing

599
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:55,360
okay

600
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,039
because because there are there are some

601
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,720
products out there that are decent that

602
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:00,400
have palm glycerin in it

603
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,240
and sometimes you got to take the good

604
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,280
you take the bad that's what you do

605
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,880
right

606
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:10,559
but then she went to a different level

607
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:13,440
and they don't use the palm glycerin

608
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:15,200
and they use organic when they can on

609
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,640
top of it with their glycerin they use a

610
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:20,000
flax glycerin

611
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:22,480
they took it to a level no one has so

612
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,600
they took it to the flax glycerin right

613
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,559
and that alone is mind-blowing because

614
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,799
they insist

615
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:30,640
on making sure they're not going to do

616
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:33,679
the status quo

617
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:36,159
just regular crap that's out there

618
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:37,679
and so that alone is mind-blowing

619
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:39,200
somebody's like well i like this other

620
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,880
company i'll go get there's

621
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,240
i'll get use their lemon bomb or

622
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,480
whatever it's like oh you just got palm

623
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:47,120
glycerin

624
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:49,600
and vimergy doesn't use palm glycerin

625
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:51,840
and i didn't go into this nitty gritty

626
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,280
the last time i did a live you guys and

627
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,840
i didn't go into this nitty gritty of

628
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,919
all this

629
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,960
incredible information about the energy

630
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:59,440
or whatever and

631
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:01,360
because there's so much to talk about

632
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:04,000
but these things matter

633
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,640
here's the next one from vimergy right

634
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,480
that blows

635
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,400
blows my mind it might blow your mind

636
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,159
they independently test everything for

637
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,720
bacteria

638
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:13,760
and the other companies don't think

639
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:17,120
about that

640
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:21,200
that right there independently

641
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:24,799
test for bacteria they independently

642
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:26,679
test for bacteria

643
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:28,480
when the other companies with their

644
00:21:26,679 --> 00:21:32,080
spirulinas

645
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:34,480
and their supplement products are not

646
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,919
independently testing for bacteria never

647
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:39,440
mind testing for bacteria

648
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:42,799
most of them think about that one

649
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:44,000
okay so lisa angle said their lemon balm

650
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:46,480
really helped me

651
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,159
it helps me i'm under a lot of stress i

652
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,120
do take it i showed you guys how i take

653
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:50,880
it

654
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,480
and lorraine elle says thanks for going

655
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,080
through the nitty gritty

656
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,600
i know it doesn't make everybody happy

657
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,600
but thanks lorraine

658
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,200
robinson the details do matter they do

659
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,360
and i'm giving you guys the details

660
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:05,280
right here

661
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:07,200
um so yeah

662
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,720
so what one supplement would i suggest

663
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,720
on tick tock i just saw that right there

664
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,280
so what one supplement would i suggest

665
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,960
right

666
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,640
so if someone's not going to someone's

667
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,240
not going to get any supplements

668
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,919
fine right they're not going to be able

669
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,440
to get any or they're not interested or

670
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,880
however it is but they're interested in

671
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,039
one supplement right

672
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,559
i'd go i would go with one from the top

673
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:26,320
four

674
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:27,840
and then i would think about what's

675
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:31,200
going on in your life

676
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:34,320
do you think you're really viral do you

677
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:36,159
think you're really viral okay

678
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,760
so did you look up your symptom did you

679
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:40,960
look up your condition did you

680
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:42,799
see what's wrong with you because makers

681
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,640
of the other supplements out there in

682
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:45,120
the world like makers of the trendy

683
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,919
stuff

684
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:50,000
of colostrum and collagen and fulvic

685
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:52,159
acid or whatever that's out there right

686
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,080
makers they don't know why you're sick

687
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:57,440
but you can find out why you're sick so

688
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,919
what's wrong with you that matters right

689
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:02,000
there

690
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:04,159
okay so are you viral

691
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,919
do you think you got neurological

692
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:08,000
fatigue did you did you suffer from

693
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:09,200
neurological lyme did you suffer from

694
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,240
any kind of do you have aches and pains

695
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,840
you have tingles and numbness that's

696
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,919
mysterious vertigo anything

697
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,679
tinnitus ringing in the ears dizziness

698
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:18,000
right whatever it is

699
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:18,720
because a great one to start with is

700
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,520
zinc

701
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:23,360
that's a great one do you have

702
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,880
tendonitis do you have restless leg

703
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,480
syndrome do you have all that kind of

704
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,000
stuff then you're going into nerves

705
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:31,039
neurological so

706
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:34,559
you're using zinc to actually help

707
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:36,640
with what's causing the nerve problems

708
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:38,000
and then if you venture on to a second

709
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,480
supplement

710
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,120
it would be like the b12 so the b12

711
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,880
would be

712
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:45,279
the next one because now you're on the

713
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,880
b12 the b12 is to bring back

714
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:48,799
nerves that have been damaged hindered

715
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,400
by low-grade viruses or anything else

716
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:53,120
going on or toxins

717
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,000
so b12 is another important one you

718
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,720
could either pick

719
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,799
either or if like if that was me i'd be

720
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,799
like okay maybe i'll go with b12 when

721
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:01,520
that's over with i'll move to the zinc

722
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:04,320
meaning you

723
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:05,840
you empty the bottle you used it now hey

724
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:08,720
i'll go with the zinc

725
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,520
and that's an option too by the way it's

726
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,320
51

727
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:13,600
off amazon.com us it's a medical

728
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:19,279
textbook it's packed

729
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:21,600
take advantage of it so

730
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:24,400
so we're going into the top four i got

731
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:27,279
them right here just letting you know

732
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,080
i got the micro c i got the lemon balm i

733
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:31,360
got the zinc

734
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:33,679
i got the b12 so we're covering

735
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:35,440
this information so one of the very

736
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:37,279
important tidbits or pieces of

737
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:40,480
information that's critical

738
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:43,520
okay is that

739
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:46,000
vimergy independently tests for bacteria

740
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:48,240
that right there wins me over because

741
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,159
chlorella

742
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,320
which doesn't remove toxic heavy metals

743
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:54,640
but yet the chlorella machines going out

744
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,760
there right the marketing the mlm

745
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,840
and everything else they do for

746
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,880
chlorella so everybody's on chlorella

747
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,960
right

748
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,559
that not only doesn't get metals out to

749
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,080
take somebody to the finish line

750
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:05,919
because that's been out there it never

751
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:07,440
got anybody better see they repeat

752
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:08,799
history over and over again for the new

753
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:12,000
set of suckers

754
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:14,080
well chlorella has had bacteria in it

755
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,600
dangerous bacteria that's really mauled

756
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,279
a lot of people over the years

757
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,679
one of the reasons why i never

758
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:22,880
recommended it and i stayed

759
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:25,120
crazy far away from chlorella

760
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,000
is i've watched it rip people's guts

761
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,240
apart

762
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,840
and set them back for years and

763
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,600
sometimes never recover

764
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,440
they've never recovered from the damage

765
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:36,320
chlorella did

766
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:38,640
and that stuff isn't independently

767
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:42,880
tested for bacteria

768
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:45,279
so not only is chlorella not the option

769
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:47,279
but spirulina is better but then there's

770
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:50,400
a question of what spirulina is best

771
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:51,360
out there and then it falls onto vimergy

772
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,440
for the reasons of

773
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,400
of what they do and the quality of the

774
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:57,760
product

775
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:59,440
oh my god i'm throwing my chlorella out

776
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,279

you kind of go over my subs with me

780
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:08,559
i'm like all right all right let's take

781
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:11,360
a look like i'm on chlorella

00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:13,039
are you kidding me my god throw it out

783
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:16,320
it scares me actually

784
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:19,360
it scares me so um

785
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:21,120
let's uh move a little bit more

786
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,960
let's go back and let's back into the

787
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,640
top four we're in the top four right now

788
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,919
why is the top four important let's head

789
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,640
there now so if you're somebody that can

790
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:32,880
get the top four

791
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:34,799
you got the vitamin c the micro c

792
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,720
you got the lemon balm you got the zinc

793
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:38,240
you got the b12 so let's cover why why

794
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,080
would this be in the top four

795
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:43,600
it's important enough so if you look

796
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:45,279
here in medical medium climbs to heal

797
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:47,840
right you'll see what you need to know

798
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:51,039
about supplements in here

799
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:54,400
and it's a top four for a reason okay

800
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:57,679
and because most

801
00:26:54,400 --> 00:27:02,559
everybody's suffering with symptoms

802
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:06,159
that are viral viral related

803
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:09,760
toxin related from viruses

804
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:12,480
okay so and their nerves

805
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:13,279
are giving them symptoms let's go back

806
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,520
over that

807
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:17,360
why is this the best top four most

808
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:20,640
people are suffering from

809
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:24,399
nerve problems usually caused

810
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:27,120
by viral issues aches pains tingles and

811
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:30,480
numbness ringing the ears tick spasms

812
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:33,760
floaters in the eyes uh dizziness

00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:37,279
back pain body pain neck pain and i'm

815
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,919
gonna explain

816
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:41,360
why each one is important and cranial

817
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:45,039
nerve problems

818
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:48,559
cranial nerve problems right there

819
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:51,679
okay there's a method

820
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:53,919
to this a method that's

821
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:55,039

with problems

829
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:12,000

people have all these symptoms they're

833
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:19,919
dealing with cochlear nerve problems

834

their ears they're dealing with all

835
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:23,760

issues you guys and by the way makers of

847
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:50,880

they pull little

850
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:55,440
tidbits from medical medium this is all

851
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:57,120
original

852
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,120
unique information that saved lives

853
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,559
around the world about cranial nerves

854
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:03,919
about the trigeminal nerve and all these

855
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:07,360
other issues and viruses causing it

856
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:10,559
and metals it's where it originates

857
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:13,840
and so what people are dealing with

858
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:15,360
so if i walk down the street and spirit

859
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:18,080
of compassion is with me

like always and people are around and be

861
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,399
like

862
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:22,159
trigeminal neuralgia right here they got

863
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:23,840
the shingles virus this person has a

864
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:25,600
simplex one virus right here

865
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,960
causing problems with them this person's

866
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:29,200
got two epstein bars

867
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,799
this person's got an hhv6 they're all

868
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,480
releasing neurotoxins

869
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:33,919
this person's got restless legs because

870
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,760
of it this person's got

871
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:37,200
jaw pain because of it teeth pain in the

872
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,240
back here this person has pain in the

873
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,520
back of the neck

874
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:42,080
because of it and it's all cranial nerve

875
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:45,200
stuff

876
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:46,720
so the top four there's a reason for the

877
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,840
top four

878
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,480
and how important it is baseline i call

879
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:54,399
it

880
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:57,120
baseline okay the baseline is here

881
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:58,799
because of that reason and when you

882
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,960
learn what's wrong with you it even

883
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:04,960
comes more clear right

884
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:06,960
so okay let's go a little bit

885
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:10,240
let's go a little bit more so let's go

886
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:13,760
into why with these let's hit b12

887
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:15,360
cranial nerves they get injured they get

888
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:18,720
frayed

889
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:21,679
they fray like a piece of yarn

890
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:23,440
just so you know the migraines the

891
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:25,520
trigeminal nerve issues

892
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,720
all the problems with the nerves okay

893
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,240
the back pain

894
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:30,559
that's that's meaning like the back of

895
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,320
the neck pain right

896
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:33,840
the all the other issues tingles and

897
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,760
numbness from vegas nerves tightness of

898
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,640
the chest the panic tightness of the

899
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:40,559
throat

900
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:42,399
heart palpitations heart palpitations

901
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:44,240
all these things from the cranial nerves

902
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:48,240
your vagus nerve

903
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:51,120
trigeminal nerve right your facial nerve

904
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:52,640
facial sensitivities your hair hurts so

905
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:56,480
when you pull your hair

906
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:59,600
it hurts your scalp right all that

907
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:03,320
is those cranial nerves okay

908
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:04,480
fatigue neurological fatigue where it's

909
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:06,960
unexplainable

910
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:08,880
i'm tired every day i can't really push

911
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:12,320
through my energy is not there

912
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:14,320
cranial nerves that's why the b12 is so

913
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:16,320
important it's in the top four

914
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:17,919
that's november gb12 if you guys just

915
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,720
got on here watch this live from the

916
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:21,120
beginning again

917
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,559
on youtube if you want okay and tick

918
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,080
tock if you guys just got on there watch

919
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:26,640
it live on youtube if you want

920
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:27,519
and that's why the b12 is important why

921
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:30,559
this b12

922
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:32,000
and not another b12 okay

923
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:33,440
i'm gonna give you the rundown about

924
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,519
that too it's a combination of

925
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:38,320
methylcobalamin and adenosine cobalamin

926
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:41,600
the combination that makes a difference

927
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:44,640
it doesn't have hydroxycobalamin in it

928
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:46,640
because that one messes up the other

929
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,720
two and people don't realize it doesn't

930
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,360
have a cya cobalamin in it because that

931
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,559
one

932
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:55,039
doesn't absorb so

933
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:56,480
when it comes down to the right b12 it

934
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:58,640
matters to healing nerves now what does

935
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:02,159
b12 do for the nerves

936
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:05,840
it helps repair them nerve cells

937
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:08,480
need b12 or they can't repair

938
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:10,240
they can't repair they can't repair you

939
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:14,080
can't repair those cranial nerves

940
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:15,200
without b12 being able to be there to

941
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,600
repair

942
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:19,279
okay let's move on a little bit let's

943
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:23,679
hit zinc

944
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:26,080
zinc stops the cytokine storms from the

945
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:31,360
flu

946
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:34,320
stops the storms from the plague

947
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:35,440
zinc stops the cytokine storms but it

948
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,159
also

949
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,640
stops your immune system from getting

950
00:32:37,159 --> 00:32:41,279
overreactive

951
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:42,000
and under reactive and everybody's

952
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:43,840
immune system

953
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,000
is either overreactive or underreactive

954
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:47,120
overreactive or unreactive overreactive

955
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,880
or underactive then that's what

956
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:51,919
everybody's immune system is

957
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:53,760
and that's why the zinc matters

958
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:55,919
we're all deficient in zinc one way or

959
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:57,440
another we're all deficient because the

960
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:58,960
crops don't have it

961
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,640
and if you think pumpkin seeds is going

962
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,880
to give you enough zinc and an oyster is

963
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:04,399
going to give you a zinc you're mistaken

964
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,799
there's very little zinc in that to

965
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:08,159
begin with which leads me to the other

966
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:09,679
trend that's happening now is like

967
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:12,240
oyster related

968
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:16,240
products now it's real smart let's take

969
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:19,120
the most polluted thing out of the ocean

970
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:22,080
fill the dioxins and toxic heavy metals

971
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:24,519
and let's make it into a supplement

972
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:25,840
that's what i mean though there's no

973
00:33:24,519 --> 00:33:28,240
sensibility

974
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:29,760
it's almost like it's anybody and

975
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,919
everybody has lost their mind when it

976
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:34,720
comes down to stuff out there

977
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:36,320
and it's sad you know you were chugging

978
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,080
oysters laugh out loud chris were you

979
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:39,760
chugging oysters because of just you

980
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:43,360
liked oysters at the time

981
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:43,360
or was it because you wanted the zinc

982
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:47,120
okay anyway this is the most gentle

983
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:51,440
thing

984
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:54,080
the liquid sulfate but stabilized

985
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,640
and that's the difference right there so

986
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:57,279
that

987
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:59,600
so why is the zinc important and why do

988
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:04,559
you want to keep your immune system

989
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:04,559
level because it's up against pathogens

990
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:09,119
in our immune systems is up against

991
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:11,440
pathogens that's why

992
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:13,040
we're up against the epstein bars the

993
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:15,760
simplex one

994
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:17,599
right people have to understand some

995
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:20,159
you've ever had fever blister

996
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:20,879
and it went away the virus didn't go

997
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:24,480
away

998
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:24,480
the virus sits in the cranial nerves

999
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:28,800
virus sits in the liver that's where the

1000
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:31,440
virus sits

1001
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,800
and it creates other symptoms along the

1002
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,000
way and then you're starting to get all

1003
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:36,240
these other symptoms and you're like

1004
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,000
well wait a minute what is going on here

1005
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:40,800
and zinc's critical

1006
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,119
for stopping that from happening so the

1007
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,599
little bugs that create the simplex one

1008
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:47,520
and

1009
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:48,639
all the different bugs it actually helps

1010
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,079
you know there's people out there that

1011
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:51,359
get the worst debilitating set of

1012
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:54,079
shingles

1013
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:56,480
they could ever even imagine making them

1014
00:34:54,079 --> 00:35:00,480
almost want to commit suicide

1015
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:02,800
shingles being so so harsh so bad

1016
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:04,160
right a version of it so bad like

1017
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,040
ripping through their neck their mouth

1018
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:07,280
their face

1019
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:08,960
some really bad shingles out there and

1020
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,560
if they only had enough zinc in them or

1021
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,839
the right kind of zinc along the way if

1022
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,520
they only knew how to take care of

1023
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:16,480
themselves what foods not to eat having

1024
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:18,640
the right sink

1025
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:21,119
it's so sad i've seen a lot of sad sad

1026
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:22,720
sad situations

1027
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:25,359
all right let's move on to lemon balm

1028
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:26,640
why would lemon balm be in the top four

1029
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:29,720
guys if she just came on i'm talking

1030
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:30,880
about vemma g2 them rgbs and victor

1031
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:32,320
imergy.com

1032
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,560
if you watch the beginning of this video

1033
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,760
you'll see the reasons why vimergy is

1034
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,680
far surpassed

1035
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:39,359
supreme over anything else out there and

1036
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,480
i'm not sponsored by vimergy

1037
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:43,359
very important no and i'm not a

1038
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:46,000
shareholder of energy

1039
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:46,400
it's critical to know this stuff so why

1040
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,240
would

1041
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:53,920
lemon balm be in the top for everybody

1042
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:57,920
because of stress

1043
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:58,480
because everybody's nerves are frazzled

1044
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:01,680
because

1045
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:05,040
everybody's nerves are inflamed

1046
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:07,119
that's why they're sick

1047
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,880
their nerves are inflamed all your

1048
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:10,880
mystery symptoms that you get

1049
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,079
throughout the body many of them are

1050
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:16,320
because your nerves are

1051
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:18,880
inflamed the cranial nerves are inflamed

1052
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,880
that's why

1053
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:26,560
pertinent information beyond and

1054
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:28,079
lemon bomb right

1055
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,599
it does two things one thing is

1056
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:33,200
antiviral

1057
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:33,920
it's an antiviral very important when

1058
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,920
used as an

1059
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:38,400
antiviral the other thing is because of

1060
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:40,000
the nerves it's an antibacterial too

1061
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,839
what i love about is a lot of people

1062
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,079
though have the strep bacteria causing

1063
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:44,720
utis causing conjunctivitis causing

1064
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:47,280
styes

1065
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:49,200
causing chronic sinusitis causing

1066
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,400
chronic ear infections causing lung

1067
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:53,599
infections they'll have

1068
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:54,320
strep bacterial vaginosis bv they'll

1069
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:57,359
have

1070
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:57,839
shrek what i like about it being in the

1071
00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:01,680
top

1072
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:03,280
four what i love about that

1073
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:05,680
is people are walking around with strep

1074
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:08,000
bacteria all through them

1075
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:09,359
and limb bombs a great antibacterial for

1076
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:14,480
the strap

1077
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:17,599
but it's also an incredible nervine

1078
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:19,760
it's an incredible nerve calmer

1079
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:21,119
it's what i love about it soothes the

1080
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:24,560
vagus nerve

1081
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:26,640
the vagus nerve think behind so many

1082
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:28,400
people's suffering

1083
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:31,839
that's why it's in the top four that's

1084
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:34,560
why it's part of the baseline

1085
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:34,880
and let's move on to and here's the

1086
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,359
thing

1087
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:38,720
okay here's the thing people would be

1088
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:39,119
like oh i'll go look for a lemon bomb

1089
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,480
then

1090
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:41,920
i don't want to get the vimerage you

1091
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,520
want because all because all the

1092
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:45,280
marketers are coming out now use our

1093
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:47,200
lemon balm use our lemon balm because

1094
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,800
aw is talking about lemon balm we know

1095
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,560
that we can do a with the sharks can

1096
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,880
come in and do a feeding frenzy

1097
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:54,000
just go on to his his platform and just

1098
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:56,160
be like pushing there's

1099
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,119
another b12 push another liquid zinc on

1100
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,200
somebody

1101
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:00,880
and get people enticed the bots will

1102
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,400
come out the paid bots will come out

1103
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:05,920
left and right

1104
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:07,920
right and but they don't realize yeah

1105
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,960
guess what and you get that other lemon

1106
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:11,280
balm

1107
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:13,839
and they'll be a small percentage of an

1108
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:15,839
ingredient that you don't know about

1109
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:17,520
that's not good for you that's inside

1110
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:20,079
that lemon balm

1111
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,720
because the supplement companies all

1112
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:24,240
have to

1113
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:27,280
abide by some evil rule

1114
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:29,359
that you can that that the suppliers

1115
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:32,240
that the manufacturers

1116
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:33,200
put things in there nobody knows about

1117
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:36,400
and members just say

1118
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:37,599
uh-uh not gonna happen not gonna happen

1119
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,760
with vimergy

1120
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:42,320
there's no way we're letting anything in

1121
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:44,880
here that can hide

1122
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:46,480
and not have to be recognized and that's

1123
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:48,400
why and that's one reason plus the lemon

1124
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:52,079
balm they source is

1125
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:54,240
the best through the roof move on

1126
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:57,200
deanna says i watch so many of these

1127
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:59,839
lives and they are invaluable with info

1128
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:01,599
but this is what so many need so they

1129
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:03,760
can just start i know

1130
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:05,200
i don't know i'm honored to hear deanna

1131
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:08,960
seriously

1132
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:11,440
so vitamin c all right here we are

1133
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:14,079
vitamin c is in the top four because

1134
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:16,480
it's still that important

1135
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:18,320
it's still that important without

1136
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:21,760
vitamin c

1137
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:24,560
we die but that brings me back to

1138
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:27,280
without b12 we died

1139
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:28,880
without b12 or vitamin c we die did you

1140
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:32,800
know that

1141
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:36,960
scurvy was a real thing okay

1142
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:40,400
without any fruit or a squeeze of lemon

1143
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:42,560
or squeeze of lime or an orange too many

1144
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:44,640
years going by

1145
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,839
without any kind of fruit without a

1146
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:48,000
berry without an

1147
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:49,839
apple too many years too many months

1148
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,560
going by

1149
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:54,480
without fresh vegetables that also have

1150
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:56,800
some vitamin c in there right

1151
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:58,640
vitamin c if you take out any vegetable

1152
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:00,240
whatsoever and you take out ever if you

1153
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:04,079
just lived off of only

1154
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:05,599
canned meat and only canned meat and

1155
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:06,880
this isn't an anti-meat campaign because

1156
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:08,240
i'm pro-animal protein and i'm

1157
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,680
pro-plant-based if you're plant-based

1158
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,960
steak plant-based

1159
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:13,280
if your animal protein that's what you

1160
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:16,560
like to stay for animal protein

1161
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:18,319
but just learn the tools so you can heal

1162
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,839
because i'm not on one side of the aisle

1163
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:21,440
or another because it ain't about that

1164
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:22,960
you can be sick when you're vegan

1165
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:24,240
you can be sick as a dog when you're

1166
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:26,480
plant-based and you could be sick as a

1167
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:28,400
dog as a keto dude

1168
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:29,920
maybe sick as a dog as an animal protein

1169
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,440
person

1170
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,800
that's why animal protein diets have

1171
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:34,560
incorporated so much medical medium

1172
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,920
information by now it's unbelievable and

1173
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,280
it's sickening too watch because they

1174
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,319
won't say anything back to medical

1175
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,560
medium we'll just

1176
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:41,839
oh oh we better bring in that now

1177
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,200
because medical medium has a record of

1178
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:44,800
getting more people better than we've

1179
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,480
ever seen we better bring this into our

1180
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:49,119
new diet

1181
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:51,280
the vitamin c is critical right without

1182
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:54,560
it if you lived off of canned meat

1183
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:56,319
and only canned meat it would be

1184
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:57,599
devastating

1185
00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:58,880
if you lived okay let's just say

1186
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:01,119
something else let's say something else

1187
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:04,800
that has no vitamin c in it

1188
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:04,800
what if you lived off of canned

1189
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:11,440
mushrooms or can you lived off of

1190
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:12,960
canned uh something that doesn't know

1191
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,480
vitamin c just canned beans

1192
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,760
it's okay say you're not an animal

1193
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,880
protein person and you're not gonna do

1194
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,480
canned meat

1195
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:20,560
a little of canned beans just canned

1196
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:24,240
beans only but only

1197
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:26,240
be devastating because you

1198
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:27,680
you would lose all your vitamin c to the

1199
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:29,119
point where you would just go down with

1200
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:31,359
the ship just like they did in the old

1201
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:31,359
days

1202
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:38,240
so question mark emma says why can't we

1203
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,760

but there isn't one that matches this

1232
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:47,440
the others are like battery acid

1233
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:49,280
that's the problem that's the problem

1234
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:51,680
like battery acid you got sensitive

1235
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:53,040
tummy that stuff will just burn your

1236
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:55,839
stomach

1237
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:57,440
it's hard on the system vitamin c's the

1238
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:58,000
heart on the system and i know a lot of

1239
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,440
you guys know

1240

this i bet you a lot of you guys have

1241
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:05,520
tried vitamin c's and they're hard

1242
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:06,800
they're hard and this is the one that's

1243
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:09,200
gentle the microc

1244
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:10,880
is a whole different combination

1245
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:14,160
different make and model

1246
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:16,000
one that's it it it the others are

1247
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,640
antiquated compared to so that's why i

1248
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,480
love that

1249
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:20,400
i could take more of it so when i take

1250
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:21,680
vitamin c you know i take six capsules

1251
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,240
three times a day right that's what i'll

1252
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,760
do

1253
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:25,359
six capsules three times and i saw

1254
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:28,480
somebody in the comment section

1255
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:30,800
say if aw is so healthy why would he

1256
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:32,079
take that much sup

1257
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,800
i saw that i don't know if you guys saw

1258
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:35,520
that right if anthony william is so darn

1259
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:38,960
healthy

1260
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:41,119
why wouldn't he need no supplements

1261
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:42,800
uh i'm up against all the same thing you

1262
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:44,800
guys are up against

1263
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:46,480
chemtrails falling out of the sky

1264
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:47,839
fragrances i'm breathing in left and

1265
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:50,480
right wherever i go

1266
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:52,079
that are highly toxic and dangerous

1267
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,960
people scented candles coming off of

1268
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:55,280
their clothes

1269
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:57,440
air fresheners i'm up against flu

1270
00:43:55,280 --> 00:44:00,640
viruses i'm up against the plague

1271
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:02,000
if i'm out and about right i'm up

1272
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:03,839
against all that stuff but the

1273
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,200
differences between me and you maybe are

1274
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:06,720
actually i could be wrong you guys might

1275
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,040
not sleep that much differences between

1276
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:09,839
me

1277
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:11,200
i don't sleep that much and so you

1278
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:14,800
better believe

1279
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:16,560
i get jacked up on vitamins because

1280
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:18,160
i i you know the other night i had three

1281
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:19,520
hours i think i when i did that live the

1282
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:21,119
other day i had two and a half hours of

1283
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:22,800
sleep or something i forgot what it was

1284
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:25,520
ridiculous it was three hours

1285
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:28,160
so i'm writing the book and and that

1286
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:30,960
book has a deadline

1287
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:31,599
it has a deadline and i got to get it in

1288
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,440
in the book

1289
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:34,720
and i can't cut corners on the book i

1290
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:37,359
can't say

1291
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:38,400
my crowd will be happy with whatever i

1292
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:41,200
wrote down here

1293
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:43,599
they'll be they'll be fine no it has to

1294
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:47,359
be the best book ever written

1295
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:50,880
out of medical medium right it has to be

1296
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:51,200
like a book upon all books and i feel

1297
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:53,119
that

1298
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:55,680

if you're if you're on a tight budget

1324
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:51,280
it's worth

1325
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:53,920
thinking about the top four

1326
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:55,599
okay if you're on a tight budget you're

1327
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:58,800
gonna buy just one supplements worth

1328
00:45:55,599 --> 00:46:00,640
picking one out of the top four

1329
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:03,520
so why is vitamin c important let's go

1330
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:05,359
into it because it is a great antiviral

1331
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:06,800
viruses hate vitamin c and if you have

1332
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:07,760
enough vitamin c floating through your

1333
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,200
bloodstream

1334
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:12,000
floating through your bloodstream but

1335
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:14,880
not vitamin c floating through there

1336
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,480
then you're gonna protect yourself it's

1337
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:20,640
great protection

1338
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:21,920
also cells need vitamin c to thrive

1339
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:24,240
so all the different cells throughout

1340
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:28,640
our body brain cells everything

1341
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:32,480

details matter and they're in there so

1377
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:36,559
let's go a little bit we'll go a little

1378
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:39,440
bit further so

1379
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:40,559
there's a question out there one

1380
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:43,359
question is

1381
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:45,760
how come psychobala mean you're not

1382
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:47,440
talking about that type of coenzyme that

1383
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:49,520
b12 how come you're not talking about

1384
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:50,720
that b12 one is it doesn't absorb that's

1385
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:54,160
the bad b12

1386
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:57,280
that's the b12 that's in b12 shots

1387
00:47:54,160 --> 00:48:00,319
that doesn't work that's the b12

1388
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:02,240
that's in crappy b12 supplements

1389
00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:03,599
and just because you might find the

1390
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:04,720
adenosine kabbalah man and the

1391
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:06,559
methicobalamin

1392
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:07,920
the good b12 and another supplement

1393
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:09,839
doesn't mean there's not that hidden

1394
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:11,359
junk i told you about plus fillers plus

1395
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:14,559
alcohol and everything else

1396
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:16,640
and natural flavors and msg

1397
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:17,920
so and this one doesn't have that and

1398
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:20,000
that's the bemrg one

1399
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:21,440
okay that's the vimergy b12 that i was

1400
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,599
just talking about right

1401
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,599
but

1402
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:28,400
bad supplements give supplements a bad

1403
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:32,559
name

1404
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:35,119
that's how it works bad cleanses

1405
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:35,760
give cleanse cleanses a bad name all

1406
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:38,400
right

1407
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:40,400
couple questions so why don't you talk

1408
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:41,520
about cyocobalamin first of all that

1409
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:44,880
stuff was

1410
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:46,640
the conventional b12 the really bad

1411
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:50,240
stuff that was in the b12

1412
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:52,240
patches 20 years ago so if you wanted to

1413
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:54,800
go to a store and you wanted to buy a

1414
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:56,400
b12 supplement they had b12 patches so

1415
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:57,839
you would buy the b12 patches they had

1416
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:01,040
silocobalamin in it

1417
00:48:57,839 --> 00:49:03,839
and it didn't work it doesn't work and

1418
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:05,520
it's toxic

1419
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:07,200
so if anybody is like no sila

1420
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:08,319
cobalamin's the best because i saw that

1421
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,680
in the comments too

1422
00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:11,440
so i think that the youtube comment is

1423
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:13,599
like solid kabbalah is there like oh my

1424
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:16,000
god what planet are we on

1425
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:17,920
like who's telling people this stuff

1426
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,680
that it's the best

1427
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:22,640
this stuff was not only toxic that was

1428
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:24,240
conventional medicine's bad b12 that was

1429
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:25,280
the one that doesn't even absorb that's

1430
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:28,000
the one in the b12

1431
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:31,839
shot that poisons people that's

1432
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,839
sayakabalamin is the bad one

1433
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:35,280
and once again it's people who don't

1434
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:36,880
know why anybody's sick that talks about

1435
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:38,800
it and once again it's like these

1436
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:40,480
this history comes back to haunt us

1437
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:42,319
because we don't know about the history

1438
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:43,839
so it comes back and we get involved in

1439
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:45,599
it and then we become that person that's

1440
00:49:43,839 --> 00:49:46,960
like whoa cytobalam and that's the one

1441
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:48,640
to use and you're like whoa you just did

1442
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:49,599
everybody a disservice even mentioning

1443
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:50,960
that

1444
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:53,240
okay so let's get into the next thing

1445
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:55,440
here's the question right here

1446
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:57,440
methylfolate so vimergy's got a

1447
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:59,359
methylfolate right

1448
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:01,440
they got a methylfolate and people are

1449
00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:04,400
like well don't you take folate with

1450
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:06,000
b12 don't you take folate with

1451
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:08,720
methylcobalamin

1452
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:10,839
yeah it's great to take together it's

1453
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:12,000
great to not you don't have to take them

1454
00:50:10,839 --> 00:50:14,079
together

1455
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,400
it's great to take them together

1456
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:19,040
methylfolate is important

1457
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:21,520
it is but you can also get benefits from

1458
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:24,559
b12 without methyl folate

1459
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:25,200
they don't have to be together dr fahn

1460
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:28,480
yeah

1461
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:29,920
psychobalan is the bad stuff

1462
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:31,920
so that's the answer that question

1463
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:33,280

eight

1546
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:26,160
because everybody's dealing with hepatic

1547
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:28,160
viruses

1548
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:31,119
people are all sick because of hhv-6

hhv-7 sedimental virus shingles viruses

1550
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:35,839
epstein-barr viruses simplex one viruses

1551
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:37,839
simplex two viruses and all their

1552
00:53:35,839 --> 00:53:40,800
mutations

1553
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:42,400
that's why people are sick lysine's

1554
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:45,520
great for the herpetic family

1555
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:48,640
that's why it's part of the topic people

1556
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:51,760
can get better they can

1557
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:53,760
they can and they don't have to try to

1558
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:54,960
experiment with a zeolite or a fulvic

1559
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:57,920
acid or a

1560
00:53:54,960 --> 00:54:00,640
collagen to do so or a bentonite clay or

1561
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:04,240
a charcoal powder or a fish oil oh my

1562
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:04,240
god or a probiotic oh my god

1563
00:54:08,839 --> 00:54:14,000
okay

1564
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:17,839
you know people get flu

1565
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:19,839
people get flus all year long

1566
00:54:17,839 --> 00:54:22,400
they get flus all year long and they're

1567
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:23,839
they're they're beaten down by viruses

1568
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:25,920
well people are sick with chronic

1569
00:54:23,839 --> 00:54:28,440
illness speak like autoimmune because of

1570
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:33,359
all these other viruses herpetic viruses

1571
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:36,720
cytomegalovirus the h86hv7 hhv9

1572
00:54:33,359 --> 00:54:38,400
10 through 16 undiscovered over 60

1573
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:40,720
varieties of epstein bar over 30

1574
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:42,559
varieties of shingles mm information but

1575
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:43,920
all these different viruses and that's

1576
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:45,280
why people are sick just like when

1577
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:46,559
people get the flu virus they're sick

1578
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:49,440
from the flu virus when they're sick

1579
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:49,440
from the flu virus

1580
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:55,359
so lysine's a good part of that one so

1581
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:58,160
let's go into the next one

1582
00:54:55,359 --> 00:54:59,119
curcumin right first of all dimmer zeke

1583
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:01,040
curcumin

1584
00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:02,640
far surpasses the others i won't bore us

1585
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:03,280
with like details about that already

1586
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:04,799
given

1587
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:06,319
so many reasons why the quality is off

1588
00:55:04,799 --> 00:55:08,960
the chart right

1589
00:55:06,319 --> 00:55:11,520
but what i love about curcumin because

1590
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:13,200
it acts like a natural aspirin

1591
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:15,440
people are inflamed and it's like a

1592
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:17,200
natural aspirin

1593
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:19,520
jennifer smith says i can't get my son

1594
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:20,000
to do heavy metal detox so i was hoping

1595
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:22,720
zeolite

1596
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:24,000
might be a doable compromise jennifer if

1597
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:26,079
that was my son i wouldn't be playing

1598
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:28,319
with zeolite

1599
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:29,680
i wouldn't the zeolite train came into

1600
00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:31,440
town

1601
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:33,119
many years ago and died out and

1602
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:35,200
disappeared for a reason

1603
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:38,000
and now it's back in town to hitch a

1604
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:40,400
ride onto the heavy metal detox movie

1605
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,920
and and you can do what you want do what

1606
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:44,240
your doctor tells you right

1607
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:45,440
for your son if it was my son i wouldn't

1608
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:46,480
be doing zeolite and i'll tell you one

1609
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:48,640
of the reasons is because there's a

1610
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:51,760
whole bunch of zeolites

1611
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:52,640
that are not edible and they get mixed

1612
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:54,240
and dusted

1613
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:55,599
do you guys know about this i want you i

1614
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:57,280
want to ask you guys a question this

1615
00:55:55,599 --> 00:55:58,960
will tell me how much you guys also know

1616
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:02,240
what seasoned or not right

1617
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:06,160
do you guys know this ready

1618
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:09,839
if you're eating a gluten-free product

1619
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:11,920
right that's made in a factory

1620
00:56:09,839 --> 00:56:14,400
that they also make products that have

1621
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:16,400
gluten they have to forewarn you right

1622
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:17,760
because the gluten-free product gets

1623
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:20,960
dusted

1624
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:23,440
by the not by the by the gluten product

1625
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:25,599
you guys know that right so glute like

1626
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:28,799
gluten-free breads

1627
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:32,319
are made right or they're made in

1628
00:56:28,799 --> 00:56:33,839
factories a lot of times with gluten

1629
00:56:32,319 --> 00:56:35,760
breads

1630
00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:37,119
so even though the gluten-free breads is

1631
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:40,000
gluten-free it's

1632
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:41,520
also it's the same thing with like nuts

1633
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,319
if people have nut allergies they have

1634
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:44,240
to list

1635
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:46,480
nut allergies because it's processed in

1636
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:47,280
a plant where they're also doing nuts

1637
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:50,079
right

1638
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:51,119
and then the nut dust is going on top of

1639
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:52,880
the other product

1640
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:54,720
that you think there's no nuts in you

1641
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:57,680
guys know this right

1642
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:58,319
anybody know this it's important you got

1643
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:01,440
it

1644
00:56:58,319 --> 00:57:03,359
zabo you got it cross contamination

1645
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:04,799
well that's the zeolite world and

1646
00:57:03,359 --> 00:57:06,880
there's a bunch of zeolites that are

1647
00:57:04,799 --> 00:57:09,040
like asbestos you cannot actually

1648
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:11,520
swallow it or eat it it's not diges

1649
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:15,119
it's not it's it's actually a hindrance

1650
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:17,920
to the colon intestinal tract

1651
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:19,839
so there's zeolites you cannot ingest on

1652
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:22,640
any level but they're also

1653
00:57:19,839 --> 00:57:24,079
dusted on top of zeolites you can ingest

1654
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:26,079
and nobody knows the difference because

1655
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:28,559
it's not monitored

1656
00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:29,839
it's why one of the reasons why i'm done

1657
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:34,000
with zoi

1658
00:57:29,839 --> 00:57:36,400
done done done but guess what

1659
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:38,240

there's no regulatory regulations

1682
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:24,559
on mixing the zeolite clays

1683
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:26,319
there's zeolites in the earth that are

1684
00:58:24,559 --> 00:58:27,040
mined out of the earth that are used for

1685
00:58:26,319 --> 00:58:28,799
industries

1686
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:30,400
and they're getting cross-contaminated

1687
00:58:28,799 --> 00:58:33,040
with zeolite that's ingestible

1688
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:34,480

it acts as a natural aspirin so many

1708
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:22,319
people are hurting

1709
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:25,520
they're hurting okay and curcumin

1710
00:59:22,319 --> 00:59:28,079
cumin is anti-bug too

1711
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:28,559
it's anti-bug for like basic bugs and

1712
00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:30,480
stuff

1713
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:32,480
right basic one staff and things like

1714
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:34,640
that and all that curcumin's actually

1715
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:35,520
it's great but it but i like it because

1716
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:38,000
it has

1717
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:40,079
a calming effect it is phytochemical

1718
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:43,760
compounds that soothe

1719
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:45,359
nerves and muscles and i like that this

1720
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:46,720
one doesn't have additives fillers

1721
00:59:45,359 --> 00:59:48,000
doesn't have alcohol doesn't have all

1722
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:49,680
that other junk in it

1723
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,960

1750
01:00:41,839 --> 01:00:44,720
about spirulina

1751
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:46,079
maybe in the barley grasses but let's

1752
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:46,720
before we go right to there because i

1753
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:48,880
know we're

1754
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:52,400
we've got still a couple minutes i

1755
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:55,440
talked about celery force the other day

1756
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:59,359
and someone left a comment and said

1757
01:00:55,440 --> 01:01:01,599
he's got to be kidding i wasn't kidding

1758
01:00:59,359 --> 01:01:03,440
when i first took the product it happens

1759
01:01:01,599 --> 01:01:06,799
every day when i take the product

1760
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:08,160
in like eight minutes i was cleaning out

1761
01:01:06,799 --> 01:01:08,960
my freezer i wanted to clean up my

1762
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:11,280
freezer

1763
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:12,559
and clarity came like i've never it was

1764
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:15,680
like almost

1765
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:18,079
it was bizarre this clarity that came

1766
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:20,480
and because it's got the inositol the

1767
01:01:18,079 --> 01:01:23,599
right kind of blend of inositol in there

1768
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:25,040
and it woke me up i had something like a

1769
01:01:23,599 --> 01:01:26,240
couple hours of sleep that night i was

1770
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:28,079
working all night and everything and

1771
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:30,960
then i was up in the morning

1772
01:01:28,079 --> 01:01:32,240
and i was cranky right and i took the

1773
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:34,720
celery force

1774
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:37,200
and it was like someone played a joke on

1775
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:39,040
me it was almost like not only was i

1776
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:41,760
alive and awake but i had

1777
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:43,440
clarity in the in the most strangest

1778
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:45,359
sense ever and

1779
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:47,040
and it was like also i had to clean the

1780
01:01:45,359 --> 01:01:47,839
freezer cleaned out i had you know in a

1781
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:50,319
whole bit

1782
01:01:47,839 --> 01:01:51,680
and that's something that's just

1783
01:01:50,319 --> 01:01:52,799
mind-blowing i don't know if anybody

1784
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:54,640

sometimes it hits me in 12 minutes

1806
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:35,839
sometimes it's 15 minutes but sometimes

1807
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:37,200
it's eight minutes

1808
01:02:35,839 --> 01:02:38,880
he showed us the celery forest has

1809
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:41,599

i know it's it's just it's crazy so

1813
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:48,640
anyway

1814
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:49,359
um quick run down in spirulina why is it

1815
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:53,599
in the top eight

1816
01:02:49,359 --> 01:02:53,599
let's hit that right now you guys okay

1817
01:02:54,319 --> 01:02:57,359
because getting out of toxic heavy

1818
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:59,119
metals getting the toxic heavy metals

1819
01:02:57,359 --> 01:03:01,119
out of her body is critical

1820
01:02:59,119 --> 01:03:02,400
critical get the mercury out critical to

1821
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:03,920
get the aluminum out

1822
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:05,920
critical to get all those poisons and

1823
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:09,119
toxins out i don't

1824
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:12,319
like the pacific spirulinas anymore

1825
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:13,039
the ocean got too dirty okay karen says

1826
01:03:12,319 --> 01:03:15,359
how much

1827
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:16,319
curcumin to take daily have lots of

1828
01:03:15,359 --> 01:03:18,160
inflammation

1829
01:03:16,319 --> 01:03:19,440
you should read the book and take a look

1830
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:21,039
at the supplement section and the

1831
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:21,760
illnesses and conditions look for your

1832
01:03:21,039 --> 01:03:23,280
condition

1833
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:26,799
bring it to your doctor ask your doctor

1834
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:26,799
what he thinks she thinks

1835
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:31,520
so this is the purest form of spirulina

1836
01:03:29,839 --> 01:03:33,039
out there breaks my heart when i see all

1837
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:34,160
the other bad spirulinas out there

1838
01:03:33,039 --> 01:03:34,960
because i know people aren't getting

1839
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:36,799
what they need

1840
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:38,079
not to mention they're not independently

1841
01:03:36,799 --> 01:03:41,760
bacterial

1842
01:03:38,079 --> 01:03:45,839
tested independent bacteria

1843
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:48,319
tested from bemidji that difference

1844
01:03:45,839 --> 01:03:49,119
changes everything it breaks all the

1845
01:03:48,319 --> 01:03:51,760
rules

1846
01:03:49,119 --> 01:03:53,599
and it changes everything people think

1847
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:55,200
this stuff's a joke like you know like

1848
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:57,280
the supplement quality difference are

1849
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:59,440
you kidding there's a huge

1850
01:03:57,280 --> 01:04:01,039
difference huge difference you guys

1851
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:02,000
we're live on tick tock live on youtube

1852
01:04:01,039 --> 01:04:06,079
live on facebook

1853
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:07,599
live on clubhouse and so anyway

1854
01:04:06,079 --> 01:04:09,520
we're on that right there let's let's

1855
01:04:07,599 --> 01:04:10,799
crack open a melon so here's something i

1856
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:12,559
do and i just want to give you guys a

1857
01:04:10,799 --> 01:04:16,240
quick rundown on this

1858
01:04:12,559 --> 01:04:18,000
is so i love these honeydew melons

1859
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:19,119
when i can get them a lot of times you

1860
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,799
can't get them a lot of times you have

1861
01:04:19,119 --> 01:04:21,839
to wait until they ripen that's another

1862
01:04:20,799 --> 01:04:24,480
thing too

1863
01:04:21,839 --> 01:04:26,799
so you got to learn how to ripen them

1864
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:28,640
robinson says don't they test for heavy

1865
01:04:26,799 --> 01:04:29,599
metals too though yes of course they do

1866
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:31,839
i'm saying of course they do

1867
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:33,520
independently they independently test

1868
01:04:31,839 --> 01:04:34,559
for toxic heavy metals

1869
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:36,400
there's a difference when you

1870
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:37,920
independently test the test for toxic

1871
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:39,839
heavy metals huge difference

1872
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:42,000
it's everything it means everything and

1873
01:04:39,839 --> 01:04:44,079
that and that's what's incredible

1874
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:45,839

1884
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:04,960
cubes you can throw it inside a bowl

1885

1900
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:38,880
these things make a difference about it

1901
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:41,200
let me

1902
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:43,520
let me get this guy over here for a

1903
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:43,520
second

1904
01:05:46,319 --> 01:05:48,640
all right

1905
01:05:49,359 --> 01:05:55,599
so i like to do with my spirulina

1906
01:05:52,799 --> 01:05:56,240
is i like to put it on my honeydew melon

1907
01:05:55,599 --> 01:05:58,079
so

1908
01:05:56,240 --> 01:06:00,559
this is a favorite thing of mine for a

1909
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:04,240
long long time so i take

1910
01:06:00,559 --> 01:06:08,799
some spirulina and i sprinkle it on

1911
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:10,960
i sprinkle it in the hole right

1912
01:06:08,799 --> 01:06:12,400
right in there sprinkle it in there is

1913
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:16,720
what i do

1914
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:18,319
okay so i got my spirulina in the melon

1915
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:20,079
and then i take barley grass juice

1916
01:06:18,319 --> 01:06:22,160
powder

1917
01:06:20,079 --> 01:06:25,359
i'm gonna grab some of that i'll

1918
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:25,359
sprinkle that in there too

1919
01:06:30,839 --> 01:06:37,520
so

1920
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:39,760
that's how that's how i consume it a lot

1921
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:41,920
it's not barley grass this is barley

1922
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:42,559
grass juice powder that detail matters

1923
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:45,039
right there

1924
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:46,000
people that know that for so long they

1925
01:06:45,039 --> 01:06:49,039
just saw i'll go get

1926
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:51,680
barley grass well then that did nothing

1927
01:06:49,039 --> 01:06:53,520
barley grass doesn't do anything it has

1928
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:56,640
speaker barley grass juice powder

1929
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:58,400
okay and there's no gluten in it very

1930
01:06:56,640 --> 01:07:00,319
important to know

1931
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:02,240
and if you get a crappy barley grass

1932
01:07:00,319 --> 01:07:04,960
cheese powder it's so sad because

1933
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:06,960
you know you try to you try to make sure

1934
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:08,400
in any way in your capacity people have

1935
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:09,200
information so they can heal and then

1936
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:11,039
someone will be like

1937
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:12,559
i use this barley grass juice powder i'm

1938
01:07:11,039 --> 01:07:14,799
like okay good luck

1939
01:07:12,559 --> 01:07:16,079
because under 10 of that is going to be

1940
01:07:14,799 --> 01:07:16,880
products people don't even know that's

1941
01:07:16,079 --> 01:07:18,240
in there it could be

1942
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:20,480
msg it could be anything in there and

1943
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:22,400
they don't have to put it on the label

1944
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:24,960
and you know why is it that good because

1945
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:27,039
a company said so or is there actual

1946
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:30,000
data and facts of why they actually you

1947
01:07:27,039 --> 01:07:31,920
know have it that good

1948
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:33,280
it's just it's actually crazy really so

1949
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:35,119
this is what i do and what i do is i

1950
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:36,400
scoop out the melon like that so that's

1951
01:07:35,119 --> 01:07:38,720
one way i have it

1952
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:39,760
you can cube up the melon you can put it

1953
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:41,760
in a bowl

1954
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:43,520
and i'll take this to my desk and i'll

1955
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:44,799
just eat it like that while you know a

1956
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:46,079
ripe melon and i'll actually put the

1957
01:07:44,799 --> 01:07:48,000
spoon in and i'll have a little bit of

1958
01:07:46,079 --> 01:07:50,319
that like that i've done that so many

1959
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,319
