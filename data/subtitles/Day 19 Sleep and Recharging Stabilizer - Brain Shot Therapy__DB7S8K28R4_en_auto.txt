[329.40 - 335.24] all right insomnia let's do this day 19.
[335.34 - 342.12] trouble sleeping can sometimes be as
[339.18 - 344.70] simple as a racing mind do you guys get
[342.12 - 345.72] racing mind at all does that happen to
[344.70 - 349.38] you
[345.72 - 351.90] like you're in bed you want to sleep
[349.38 - 353.52] you wish you can sleep
[351.90 - 358.50] but you
[353.52 - 360.78] can't sleep because your mind is racing
[358.50 - 362.04] right and there's different forms of
[360.78 - 366.00] Mind racing that's what's really
[362.04 - 369.36] incredible right your mind is racing
[366.00 - 372.54] it's what's happening you want to sleep
[369.36 - 373.68] but this is happening right here
[372.54 - 374.78] your mind just going
[373.68 - 377.46] [Music]
[374.78 - 379.68] does that happen to you guys
[377.46 - 381.72] and you you really do want to sleep
[379.68 - 383.28] that's the sad part about it or the hard
[381.72 - 385.70] part about it is
[383.28 - 389.16] you need to sleep you say to yourself
[385.70 - 390.90] but your mind is just racing Erica Malek
[389.16 - 393.12] says I take this shot every night before
[390.90 - 394.62] bed for the last three months and I
[393.12 - 397.26] sleep soundly without waking up
[394.62 - 400.20] incredible the shot is so amazing
[397.26 - 402.20] and let's see it's helped me it's helped
[400.20 - 404.82] with my insomnia so much thank you aw
[402.20 - 407.34] SOC incredible
[404.82 - 409.86] trouble sleeping can sometimes be as
[407.34 - 412.44] simple as a racing mind that's trying to
[409.86 - 415.02] solve a problem are you trying to solve
[412.44 - 416.58] a problem and your mind takes over do
[415.02 - 418.50] you fall asleep for a little while and
[416.58 - 421.14] then you wake up a couple hours later
[418.50 - 425.28] and now you're trying to solve a problem
[421.14 - 427.76] and your mind is just going right
[425.28 - 432.12] laughs
[427.76 - 434.64] it could even be stress creating the
[432.12 - 436.86] mind to race right you're under stress
[434.64 - 438.54] it's triggering the mind to race because
[436.86 - 440.46] think about that your mind is racing
[438.54 - 443.16] because it's being triggered stressed
[440.46 - 446.76] you're trying to solve a problem
[443.16 - 449.72] or just plain old worry in your life
[446.76 - 449.72] plain old worry
[450.48 - 456.60] we don't need to stress ourselves out
[453.06 - 458.70] over a bad night or two
[456.60 - 462.72] right a lot of you guys are like I had
[458.70 - 465.18] more than a bad night or two bad nights
[462.72 - 469.40] when sleeping problems become chronic
[465.18 - 471.90] that's when there's more going on yes
[469.40 - 474.24] neurotransmitter chemicals
[471.90 - 476.42] are the one critical part of being able
[474.24 - 478.80] to sleep
[476.42 - 481.08] neurotransmitter chemicals
[478.80 - 483.30] what I love about what you're looking in
[481.08 - 485.70] front of you right here okay this
[483.30 - 488.76] stabilizer that we're going to do the
[485.70 - 491.82] sleep and recharging stabilizer
[488.76 - 495.12] is it benefits you in the neuro
[491.82 - 499.58] transmitter activity area that's where
[495.12 - 499.58] it benefits it's targeting that
[500.70 - 504.72] that's when there's more going on
[502.68 - 508.04] neurotransmitter chemicals are the one
[504.72 - 510.42] critical part of being able to sleep
[508.04 - 514.46] electricity is running through every
[510.42 - 514.46] neuron as we're sleeping
[514.62 - 518.16] so I think what people really don't
[516.36 - 520.38] realize is when they go to sleep
[518.16 - 521.46] their neurons are just as active in many
[520.38 - 523.56] ways
[521.46 - 527.54] so as we're sleeping electricity is
[523.56 - 527.54] still going through all the neurons
[528.36 - 532.74] if neurotransmitters are diminished
[530.46 - 534.78] here's what's interesting
[532.74 - 539.24] if your neurotransmitters are
[534.78 - 542.22] diminishing weakened kind of broken down
[539.24 - 544.38] anemic not anemic
[542.22 - 548.76] not anemic like claridin of whatever
[544.38 - 551.64] iron all that stuff no anemic just being
[548.76 - 554.82] very low
[551.64 - 557.90] I'm on page 354 someone just asked
[554.82 - 557.90] of brain saver
[559.50 - 564.48] if neurotransmitters are diminished
[561.24 - 569.18] electrical impulses have a tough time
[564.48 - 569.18] traveling throughout the brain
[569.52 - 573.54] what that means is your electricity
[571.20 - 575.88] struggles when your neurotransmitters
[573.54 - 578.76] are down
[575.88 - 581.46] low neurotransmitter chemicals or
[578.76 - 584.52] weakened ones can cause the brain to
[581.46 - 587.70] have difficulty finding balance so you
[584.52 - 591.14] can ease into sleep and stay there stay
[587.70 - 591.14] asleep stay there
[592.50 - 598.92] so low neurotransmitter chemicals
[596.88 - 601.02] or weakened ones
[598.92 - 603.00] can cause the brain to have difficulty
[601.02 - 604.92] finding balance
[603.00 - 606.62] that means that when you're having
[604.92 - 609.00] diminished
[606.62 - 612.36] neurotransmitter chemicals
[609.00 - 614.10] your electricity is trying to swim
[612.36 - 616.32] around it
[614.10 - 617.34] it's trying to stay charged while you're
[616.32 - 621.60] sleeping
[617.34 - 625.38] but it's not staying calm and smooth
[621.60 - 627.54] instead it's more erratic
[625.38 - 629.34] it's more Rogue
[627.54 - 631.56] there's a problem
[629.34 - 635.42] so you're not able to relax and sleep
[631.56 - 635.42] you're not able to stay asleep long
[636.54 - 642.18] memory Stubbs says I have no way to make
[639.18 - 643.68] them where I currently live but I'm
[642.18 - 645.54] watching and learning until I can do
[643.68 - 647.34] them it's incredible you don't have to
[645.54 - 648.78] make these brain shot therapies you can
[647.34 - 651.24] just listen to the information and
[648.78 - 653.58] reading out a brain saver some of these
[651.24 - 656.22] uh lives that we've done in these 20
[653.58 - 657.90] days in this 19 days just phenomenal
[656.22 - 659.22] information that's been mind-blowing and
[657.90 - 663.20] you don't even have to do the brain
[659.22 - 663.20] shots you can just chill out hang out
[663.84 - 667.32] someone may also have a sensitive
[665.82 - 669.42] nervous system due to a chronic
[667.32 - 671.22] low-grade viral infection so this is
[669.42 - 673.44] important to know
[671.22 - 675.42] a large majority of people's sleep
[673.44 - 677.58] issues is because someone has a
[675.42 - 679.56] low-grade viral infection
[677.58 - 681.06] they don't know it maybe they had an
[679.56 - 683.70] autoimmune diagnosis but don't know
[681.06 - 686.10] that's what it is whatever's going on
[683.70 - 687.84] they're sick with something they're
[686.10 - 690.24] struggling with something
[687.84 - 691.80] so someone may have a sensitive nervous
[690.24 - 693.60] system now why would you have a
[691.80 - 696.00] sensitive nervous system if you have a
[693.60 - 698.16] low-grade viral infection
[696.00 - 699.30] because the Epstein-Barr virus or the
[698.16 - 701.28] shingles
[699.30 - 703.86] or any of the herpetic virus especially
[701.28 - 705.42] I've seen Barn shingles which often goes
[703.86 - 708.68] undiagnosed
[705.42 - 712.62] releases neurotoxins
[708.68 - 717.06] neurotoxins are unfortunately one of the
[712.62 - 719.10] big problems with people sleeping good
[717.06 - 720.06] I've seen people
[719.10 - 721.86] okay
[720.06 - 724.38] that have the worst chronic fatigue
[721.86 - 727.26] syndrome the worst me chronic fatigue
[724.38 - 729.60] syndrome or just severe fatigue and you
[727.26 - 731.34] would think they sleep
[729.60 - 733.86] they're not sleeping they're not
[731.34 - 738.12] sleeping good there are people
[733.86 - 739.92] that are diagnosed with me CFS
[738.12 - 741.48] they're diagnosed with chronic fatigue
[739.92 - 743.76] syndrome
[741.48 - 747.18] but they're not sleeping good
[743.76 - 750.12] people can't understand it you're tired
[747.18 - 752.52] you've got fatigue sleep
[750.12 - 754.02] just sleep now there are people that get
[752.52 - 757.14] diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome
[754.02 - 760.32] and they sleep 12 14 hours 16 hours and
[757.14 - 762.96] they can't do anything but sleep but
[760.32 - 765.24] that can be just a temporary part of
[762.96 - 767.94] their chronic fatigue that could be one
[765.24 - 770.22] year and then another year
[767.94 - 772.32] they can't sleep and they still have
[770.22 - 774.90] chronic fatigue syndrome they're tired
[772.32 - 776.64] they're suffering and they can't sleep
[774.90 - 780.60] you know anybody that's gone for that
[776.64 - 782.76] that's me Jan Antonio says that's me
[780.60 - 784.14] that's a big deal and a lot of people go
[782.76 - 785.76] through that
[784.14 - 789.54] lots of people
[785.76 - 792.36] add add me to Anya's okay
[789.54 - 793.74] so here you are you're tired you don't
[792.36 - 795.90] feel good
[793.74 - 797.82] you got chronic fatigue
[795.90 - 800.52] or you just feel like your legs feel
[797.82 - 801.78] like sandbags you can't get ahead of
[800.52 - 804.12] yourself
[801.78 - 805.80] you can only do so much kitchen work you
[804.12 - 807.54] can only do so much you know vacuuming
[805.80 - 809.82] around your house you get wasted easy
[807.54 - 812.10] you're on mattress Island
[809.82 - 815.58] you're fatigued
[812.10 - 818.16] then someone might say to you hey
[815.58 - 819.48] why don't you just sleep it off
[818.16 - 820.92] and you're like
[819.48 - 822.42] I can't
[820.92 - 825.24] I go to bed
[822.42 - 827.40] I can't get eight hours of sleep I can
[825.24 - 830.40] only get four hours or three hours or
[827.40 - 832.74] five hours take a long nap I can't take
[830.40 - 834.60] a long nap I can't fall asleep during
[832.74 - 835.80] the day but you got chronic fatigue
[834.60 - 837.48] syndrome you should be able to fall
[835.80 - 839.64] asleep during the day I can fall asleep
[837.48 - 841.98] during the day though I'm suffering I
[839.64 - 844.14] could only take a nap here if I'm lucky
[841.98 - 846.00] I could only get five hours of sleep one
[844.14 - 848.64] night some nights I'll get seven hours
[846.00 - 850.32] and then the next night two hours this
[848.64 - 851.58] is what people go through you guys
[850.32 - 854.58] probably know this right so you probably
[851.58 - 856.80] know somebody that's gone through this
[854.58 - 859.86] so there's so many people
[856.80 - 861.36] who get CFS or me CFS meaning they get
[859.86 - 863.34] the diagnosis they're struggling and
[861.36 - 866.40] they're tired all the time they have low
[863.34 - 868.14] grade viral infections and neurotoxins
[866.40 - 870.00] are getting to their brain and
[868.14 - 871.68] preventing them from sleeping a peaceful
[870.00 - 873.36] sleep
[871.68 - 875.10] their neurotransmitter chemicals are
[873.36 - 878.10] struggling they have neurotoxins in the
[875.10 - 881.40] brain and they can't sleep good but then
[878.10 - 883.14] they get picked on and bullied by people
[881.40 - 885.72] they know friends they know family
[883.14 - 888.84] members they know they get bullied
[885.72 - 890.28] because here you are tired why don't you
[888.84 - 891.54] just get a good night's sleep and get
[890.28 - 893.82] fixed
[891.54 - 895.74] and then one night
[893.82 - 898.02] if they're not on benzodiazepines
[895.74 - 899.88] because they got they got in trouble and
[898.02 - 901.20] they're addicted to benzos to try to
[899.88 - 902.52] like get through their anxiety and
[901.20 - 905.82] sleeping and their chronic fatigue
[902.52 - 908.10] syndrome and then one night they sleep a
[905.82 - 908.76] really long night's sleep a good night's
[908.10 - 910.98] sleep
[908.76 - 913.38] and then everybody says to him well you
[910.98 - 915.90] slept eight hours that night you should
[913.38 - 918.12] be back to normal you should be fixed
[915.90 - 919.98] and it's like no it gave me a little bit
[918.12 - 922.08] more energy that day it made it so I can
[919.98 - 924.42] function a little bit but I'm not back
[922.08 - 926.10] to normal and I'm not better yet I still
[924.42 - 927.72] have chronic fatigue syndrome yes I
[926.10 - 929.52] slept one night
[927.72 - 931.98] but then the next night they only sleep
[929.52 - 933.84] like two hours or one hour and I know
[931.98 - 935.64] that there's this isn't everybody but so
[933.84 - 939.00] many people right Jessica Gail says
[935.64 - 942.12] always feel like I'm tired of falling
[939.00 - 943.80] asleep and my body jolts back awake this
[942.12 - 945.78] makes so much sense wish I could get
[943.80 - 947.34] some peaceful sleep I know so many
[945.78 - 949.20] people are going through this
[947.34 - 951.30] so I'm talking about CFS a little bit
[949.20 - 953.40] too where people get blamed they have
[951.30 - 955.02] this chronic chronic fatigue syndrome
[953.40 - 956.82] and they're getting blamed
[955.02 - 959.40] why don't you just sleep it off and get
[956.82 - 960.72] better you're so tired it's like no I
[959.40 - 963.12] can't sleep and there are people with
[960.72 - 965.52] CFS their first few years of CFS all
[963.12 - 967.44] they're doing is sleeping and then they
[965.52 - 968.88] hit the wall they're not better yet and
[967.44 - 971.04] they're not sleeping anymore it's like
[968.88 - 972.90] they slept plenty but they're still sick
[971.04 - 976.38] and still not functioning and can't
[972.90 - 979.56] sleep good anymore there's that too
[976.38 - 981.18] talking about viral issues with any kind
[979.56 - 983.64] of sleep problems since we're what we're
[981.18 - 985.68] dealing with now
[983.64 - 988.50] so someone may also have sensitive
[985.68 - 990.72] nervous systems due to low-grade viral
[988.50 - 992.70] infections like shingles and EBD and the
[990.72 - 994.32] neurotoxins that are released from these
[992.70 - 996.30] viruses are swimming around their body
[994.32 - 1000.64] attaching themselves to the vagus nerves
[996.30 - 1000.64] yes the vagus nerves
[1000.92 - 1007.40] s the vagus nerves
[1005.42 - 1009.62] you know and I'll say I'm guilty of
[1007.40 - 1011.30] saying vagus nerve many times on and off
[1009.62 - 1013.10] that's because people don't they don't
[1011.30 - 1014.96] hear you when you say Vegas nerves a lot
[1013.10 - 1017.42] they'll be like because everybody will
[1014.96 - 1019.22] be like vagus nerve that's nerves
[1017.42 - 1020.96] there's two of them I'm saying that
[1019.22 - 1023.48] because we did a Vegas nerve show right
[1020.96 - 1025.28] where the nerves
[1023.48 - 1027.32] there's two of them coming out of the
[1025.28 - 1029.48] brain stem and they get all saturated
[1027.32 - 1032.50] with neurotoxins and that really stops
[1029.48 - 1032.50] people from sleeping too
[1033.50 - 1041.86] all right let's keep on going
[1036.04 - 1044.12] which page Gabrielle says Gabriella 354.
[1041.86 - 1047.78] neurotoxins breaking out of the liver
[1044.12 - 1051.08] and traveling through the bloodstream
[1047.78 - 1054.38] can reach the brain
[1051.08 - 1056.90] where they saturate pollute and diminish
[1054.38 - 1059.90] neurotransmitter chemicals that's one of
[1056.90 - 1061.78] the key points right there
[1059.90 - 1065.48] a lot of people have diminished
[1061.78 - 1068.42] neurotransmitter chemicals why
[1065.48 - 1070.10] why are they diminished
[1068.42 - 1071.66] some people might diminish them because
[1070.10 - 1072.74] they're smoking too much weed some
[1071.66 - 1074.60] people might diminish them because
[1072.74 - 1076.22] they're doing Ayahuasca some people
[1074.60 - 1078.38] might dim diminish them because they're
[1076.22 - 1080.30] doing too much psilocybin some people
[1078.38 - 1082.40] might diminish them because you're not
[1080.30 - 1083.60] getting any nutrients at all for their
[1082.40 - 1085.88] brain and they're under tremendous
[1083.60 - 1087.56] stress it's a huge trigger some people
[1085.88 - 1089.42] might have them diminished for other
[1087.56 - 1091.10] reasons too some people don't have
[1089.42 - 1093.82] enough glucose in their brain and that's
[1091.10 - 1093.82] diminishing it
[1094.40 - 1100.60] but neurotoxins
[1096.80 - 1100.60] breaking out of the liver
[1100.88 - 1106.46] and traveling through the bloodstream
[1103.16 - 1108.50] can reach the brain where they saturate
[1106.46 - 1110.30] and pollute and diminished
[1108.50 - 1112.28] neurotransmitter chemicals this is
[1110.30 - 1114.14] important neurotoxins from low-grade
[1112.28 - 1117.76] viral infections which everybody who's
[1114.14 - 1117.76] diagnosed with autoimmune has
[1117.80 - 1121.04] they don't know it but that's what they
[1119.72 - 1124.34] have
[1121.04 - 1126.68] everybody diagnosed with autoimmune at
[1124.34 - 1128.30] the doctor's office is struggling with a
[1126.68 - 1129.80] low-grade viral infection whether the
[1128.30 - 1131.42] doctor knows it because they don't know
[1129.80 - 1133.04] medical meme information or they do know
[1131.42 - 1135.68] medical meme information because that's
[1133.04 - 1137.86] mm info I put that out there all these
[1135.68 - 1137.86] years
[1139.28 - 1143.66] even if they don't if that they don't
[1141.92 - 1145.16] test for it or not test for it they got
[1143.66 - 1146.60] a glow grade viral infection and here's
[1145.16 - 1147.32] what happens with autoimmune you might
[1146.60 - 1151.52] not
[1147.32 - 1154.22] see a viral issue in a test but five
[1151.52 - 1157.18] years later it shows up because it was
[1154.22 - 1157.18] the problem the whole time
[1158.66 - 1163.64] hence Kathy says not having the energy
[1161.60 - 1165.80] to make the shots
[1163.64 - 1168.56] I have been alternating alternating
[1165.80 - 1170.78] between the lemon balm and shock therapy
[1168.56 - 1173.48] and the California poppy shock therapy
[1170.78 - 1175.64] helps my sleep and my restless legs
[1173.48 - 1178.04] that's incredible that is incredible I
[1175.64 - 1180.94] got the lemon balm here
[1178.04 - 1180.94] foreign
[1181.46 - 1184.18] but yeah
[1185.30 - 1190.58] incredible education educating myself
[1188.78 - 1194.06] and doctors think these pains are
[1190.58 - 1195.68] autoimmune and genetic unbelievable
[1194.06 - 1198.50] so what happens is people have these
[1195.68 - 1200.14] low-grade viral infections
[1198.50 - 1202.82] there is
[1200.14 - 1205.46] protocols in here
[1202.82 - 1206.36] medical meme shock Therapies
[1205.46 - 1208.22] because that's what we were talking
[1206.36 - 1210.34] about a second ago right medical meme
[1208.22 - 1212.30] shock therapies and protocols first
[1210.34 - 1215.60] sleeping issues and all kinds of other
[1212.30 - 1218.36] problems too it's an Incredible Book
[1215.60 - 1220.34] Incredible Book you can take the book to
[1218.36 - 1223.24] your doctor and ask your doctor what's
[1220.34 - 1223.24] right for you
[1228.94 - 1231.98] neurotoxins breaking out of the liver
[1230.78 - 1234.38] like I said traveling through the
[1231.98 - 1236.48] bloodstream
[1234.38 - 1238.94] saturate the brain and diminish
[1236.48 - 1240.86] neurotransmitter activity
[1238.94 - 1242.36] because someone has a low-grade viral
[1240.86 - 1244.82] infection and if they have a higher
[1242.36 - 1247.58] grade viral infection high grade it can
[1244.82 - 1248.90] even be worse and more difficult there
[1247.58 - 1252.20] are people out there
[1248.90 - 1255.20] that cannot sleep for four straight days
[1252.20 - 1257.66] they get hospitalized or they have to
[1255.20 - 1260.92] induce a coma
[1257.66 - 1260.92] because they can't sleep
[1261.50 - 1266.96] and I've always told people I've ever
[1263.96 - 1269.06] known and run into anything like this
[1266.96 - 1271.46] but you can't see it
[1269.06 - 1274.22] like you're not sleeping
[1271.46 - 1275.60] you have to see it as you're healing and
[1274.22 - 1277.70] resting your central nervous system
[1275.60 - 1279.82] whether you sleep or not
[1277.70 - 1283.10] if you lay there
[1279.82 - 1285.80] know that you're still healing
[1283.10 - 1288.92] with your eyes shut and you're laying
[1285.80 - 1291.76] there there is something called resting
[1288.92 - 1291.76] your nerves
[1291.98 - 1297.62] and if I'm not mistaken because these
[1293.90 - 1299.66] books are two very large Bibles here and
[1297.62 - 1302.12] even I
[1299.66 - 1303.38] forget which book has what in it I have
[1302.12 - 1305.30] to grab these books and read them over
[1303.38 - 1308.56] and over again
[1305.30 - 1308.56] I'm not perfect
[1308.84 - 1313.22] but I'm not a genius
[1310.82 - 1316.30] but the information is profound and
[1313.22 - 1316.30] unfreaking believable
[1317.30 - 1321.32] IG
[1319.04 - 1324.02] Hackberry Tomo says experience this
[1321.32 - 1326.12] tired and can't sleep I was punching my
[1324.02 - 1328.70] wall and yelling begging to fall asleep
[1326.12 - 1330.20] very annoying no more after medical
[1328.70 - 1332.30] leave information okay then I have
[1330.20 - 1334.22] something to say to you
[1332.30 - 1336.40] I want to find resting the nerves in
[1334.22 - 1336.40] here
[1337.70 - 1341.08] I'm hoping it's here
[1344.24 - 1348.10] I think it might be in my other book
[1349.94 - 1353.90] yes it is of course
[1352.22 - 1357.14] I thought that was protocols for a
[1353.90 - 1358.76] second silly me let me just do this
[1357.14 - 1361.06] that's what's incredible about these
[1358.76 - 1361.06] books
[1362.60 - 1365.80] can you keep that straight
[1365.96 - 1369.16] it's like 12 pounds
[1370.22 - 1375.74] all right
[1372.32 - 1377.54] it's in the back of Protocols of course
[1375.74 - 1380.78] do you guys know the medical meeting
[1377.54 - 1385.28] books better than I do I hope you do
[1380.78 - 1388.64] that would be a dream come true to me
[1385.28 - 1391.84] to know that you guys be like no aw I
[1388.64 - 1391.84] know we're resting the nerves is
[1396.02 - 1399.26] resting nurse I want to read this a
[1397.58 - 1401.12] little bit this is really important
[1399.26 - 1402.14] right here so I'm in protocols right
[1401.12 - 1405.64] here
[1402.14 - 1408.92] and resting the nerves
[1405.64 - 1410.96] this is a very powerful centering
[1408.92 - 1412.52] technique that reboots the nervous
[1410.96 - 1416.06] system
[1412.52 - 1417.98] our brains are all susceptible to
[1416.06 - 1419.78] becoming weakened and neurologically
[1417.98 - 1421.76] sick
[1419.78 - 1423.26] if you can't sleep and you're punching
[1421.76 - 1424.70] the wall which guess what I've heard
[1423.26 - 1426.62] that before
[1424.70 - 1429.56] I've heard people Punch walls I've heard
[1426.62 - 1431.78] people punch beds I've heard people
[1429.56 - 1432.98] kick things I've heard people hurt
[1431.78 - 1434.72] themselves in the middle of the night
[1432.98 - 1437.02] because they can't sleep I've heard it
[1434.72 - 1437.02] all right
[1438.68 - 1442.94] and it breaks my heart because that's
[1440.72 - 1446.18] like a hell it I've I've heard people
[1442.94 - 1449.42] say it's an unbelievable hell
[1446.18 - 1453.76] to not be able to sleep in unbelief
[1449.42 - 1453.76] insane unbelievable hell
[1455.12 - 1458.60] there's something to know if you can't
[1456.92 - 1459.92] sleep if you ever run into a problem you
[1458.60 - 1461.42] can't sleep or you're not sleeping the
[1459.92 - 1464.60] hours you want to sleep something very
[1461.42 - 1467.56] critical to know you can still help to
[1464.60 - 1467.56] heal your nervous system
[1468.14 - 1472.22] resting the nerves this is a very
[1470.54 - 1474.08] powerful centering technique that
[1472.22 - 1475.94] reboots the nervous system
[1474.08 - 1477.50] our brains are all susceptible to
[1475.94 - 1480.68] becoming weakened and neurologically
[1477.50 - 1482.00] sick this approach is accessible to all
[1480.68 - 1485.20] of us
[1482.00 - 1485.20] Spirit of compassion
[1485.78 - 1490.00] never never stops to amaze me
[1490.04 - 1494.24] this approach is accessible to all of us
[1492.44 - 1497.12] when we need to give the brain and
[1494.24 - 1500.12] nervous system a quick restorative so we
[1497.12 - 1502.28] can be stronger for the day or night
[1500.12 - 1505.04] you can try it anywhere in an office
[1502.28 - 1507.26] chair lying or sitting on the floor bed
[1505.04 - 1509.72] or couch at home
[1507.26 - 1512.54] sitting at the kitchen table parked in
[1509.72 - 1514.58] your car the options are endless as long
[1512.54 - 1516.50] as it's a spot where you'll be safe
[1514.58 - 1519.32] closing your eyes
[1516.50 - 1521.24] that's part of the power here it's so
[1519.32 - 1522.80] easy to do
[1521.24 - 1524.36] to get started
[1522.80 - 1525.74] you're going to stop whatever else
[1524.36 - 1528.32] you're doing and if it's in the middle
[1525.74 - 1531.64] of the night that's fine you already are
[1528.32 - 1531.64] find a comfortable position
[1531.86 - 1536.90] if you have a choice opt for lying down
[1534.26 - 1539.18] if not sitting up works
[1536.90 - 1540.68] now close your eyes and keep them closed
[1539.18 - 1541.94] for eight to twenty minutes now if
[1540.68 - 1543.26] you're laying there at night in the
[1541.94 - 1544.82] middle of the night you can go way more
[1543.26 - 1547.04] than eight to 20 minutes
[1544.82 - 1548.60] but just know you can help to rejuvenate
[1547.04 - 1550.70] and restore your nervous system even
[1548.60 - 1555.14] when you got insomnia and can't sleep
[1550.70 - 1556.70] I'm on page 540 of protocols Incredible
[1555.14 - 1559.00] Book I mean you've got to get these
[1556.70 - 1559.00] books
[1560.18 - 1565.54] ideally you'll keep them closed for 12
[1562.70 - 1565.54] to 15 minutes
[1566.48 - 1571.90] that's the most effective window this is
[1568.70 - 1571.90] brain saver protocols
[1574.40 - 1577.88] you have less time eight minutes is okay
[1576.44 - 1579.38] so I'm talking about if you're in the
[1577.88 - 1580.70] middle of the day you can do this so you
[1579.38 - 1582.68] can just do eight minutes in the middle
[1580.70 - 1584.00] of the day this is so incredible so if
[1582.68 - 1587.06] you're not sleeping good at night and
[1584.00 - 1589.16] you're wrecked you're wrecked from it
[1587.06 - 1590.78] if you're not sleeping at night you're
[1589.16 - 1592.64] just feel like you're destroyed from it
[1590.78 - 1595.78] you can do this in the middle of the day
[1592.64 - 1595.78] regardless of where you are
[1595.88 - 1599.84] eight minutes is okay if you have even
[1598.40 - 1601.46] less time
[1599.84 - 1604.22] don't not do it
[1601.46 - 1606.14] don't not do it
[1604.22 - 1608.60] even three to four minutes is helpful
[1606.14 - 1610.76] any amount of time spent with this
[1608.60 - 1613.60] technique when you need a nerve recharge
[1610.76 - 1613.60] will serve you
[1614.00 - 1618.92] when you close your eyes and sit or lie
[1616.88 - 1621.58] back you need to remind yourself why
[1618.92 - 1625.34] you're doing it to rest
[1621.58 - 1627.86] your nerves

[1629.78 - 1632.54] just saw somebody in the comment went up
[1631.22 - 1635.02] there in IG you're doing this at night
[1632.54 - 1635.02] fantastic
[1636.32 - 1639.98] when you close your eyes and sit or lie
[1638.54 - 1641.60] back you need to remind yourself why
[1639.98 - 1642.80] you're doing it to rest your nerves
[1641.60 - 1645.38] don't forget that I have to read that
[1642.80 - 1649.16] again because I want to tell myself it's
[1645.38 - 1650.42] to rest my nerves
[1649.16 - 1652.64] you can't sleep at night you're
[1650.42 - 1654.74] suffering
[1652.64 - 1657.98] you're about to lose your mind
[1654.74 - 1660.68] you're about to lose your freaking mind
[1657.98 - 1663.20] I've seen people at that stage it's just
[1660.68 - 1664.40] so sad Christina says I feel so
[1663.20 - 1666.44] validated
[1664.40 - 1669.38] eight explanation points I can't count
[1666.44 - 1672.68] it's a lot not sleeping is torture and
[1669.38 - 1675.86] this is what made broke the camel's back
[1672.68 - 1677.96] for me vicious cycle I wish I would have
[1675.86 - 1679.82] found medical medium back then straight
[1677.96 - 1682.54] away
[1679.82 - 1685.88] so happy now problem is Christina
[1682.54 - 1687.44] there's large amounts of people out
[1685.88 - 1691.04] there trying to prevent people from
[1687.44 - 1694.52] finding medical medium now at this point
[1691.04 - 1696.98] there's lots of naysayers and haters
[1694.52 - 1700.34] just telling people don't
[1696.98 - 1702.50] do medical medium don't whatever
[1700.34 - 1704.48] like do you wouldn't believe it the
[1702.50 - 1706.40] vegan people are bad because
[1704.48 - 1708.08] I support people who eat animal protein
[1706.40 - 1710.48] because we're not one size fits all
[1708.08 - 1712.40] medical medium you can come here and
[1710.48 - 1714.86] still heal
[1712.40 - 1716.66] but it's unbelievable really and it's
[1714.86 - 1718.58] sad because I know so many people that
[1716.66 - 1720.38] aren't finding medical medium easy right
[1718.58 - 1723.02] now
[1720.38 - 1726.14] is terrible

[1744.44 - 1748.04] reminders of your busy day are going to
[1746.60 - 1749.18] come to mind and if you're suffering
[1748.04 - 1750.38] laying in the middle of the night you're
[1749.18 - 1752.36] so upset you're going to be thinking
[1750.38 - 1756.08] about not being able to sleep either

[1785.00 - 1789.86] punishing people but when
[1787.76 - 1791.24] what I have noticed in a lot of healing
[1789.86 - 1794.00] communities out there
[1791.24 - 1795.74] it's about punishing people they punish
[1794.00 - 1798.32] the crap out of people
[1795.74 - 1800.48] you're the blame
[1798.32 - 1802.10] it's your body attacking itself your
[1800.48 - 1803.90] thoughts are making you sick you're
[1802.10 - 1806.92] creating it I've seen it all out there
[1803.90 - 1806.92] it's just it's insane

[1809.90 - 1813.02] they were screaming in the comment you
[1811.64 - 1815.42] know how when people but you know how
[1813.02 - 1816.98] when people put large capital letters
[1815.42 - 1819.56] like non-stop like it's all capital
[1816.98 - 1823.88] letters it was something like
[1819.56 - 1827.72] how dare you tell me medical medium that
[1823.88 - 1830.18] genes aren't why I'm sick it's my genes
[1827.72 - 1832.16] and it went across like jeans and then
[1830.18 - 1834.86] it went like something like
[1832.16 - 1836.90] my jeans are bad
[1834.86 - 1838.58] that's what science tells me and I
[1836.90 - 1841.64] believe science
[1838.58 - 1844.10] it's not any kind of viral infection or
[1841.64 - 1846.80] this and this my genes are bad and I was
[1844.10 - 1847.48] like dear Lord okay okay okay okay okay
[1846.80 - 1849.62] okay
[1847.48 - 1851.66] if that's what you want to believe then
[1849.62 - 1854.12] your genes are bad you were born with
[1851.66 - 1856.16] bad genes you're just a bad Gene

[2319.96 - 2325.18] quality sleep which I love because I

[2338.50 - 2342.40] imagine actually
[2340.90 - 2344.32] I write a little bit about it in the
[2342.40 - 2346.78] brain saver books and medical medium
[2344.32 - 2349.72] Origins but it's way worse than anything
[2346.78 - 2352.24] I've ever said when it comes down to
[2349.72 - 2353.98] hearing the voice I hear and you may
[2352.24 - 2356.02] think well I don't really believe he
[2353.98 - 2358.12] hears a voice then fine I'm a genius I'm
[2356.02 - 2360.58] a freaking genius then with all these
[2358.12 - 2362.74] books and info all original unique info
[2360.58 - 2366.10] I must be genius
[2362.74 - 2368.26] but I you know I've endorsed melatonin
[2366.10 - 2369.64] primergy you know I've endorsed Bemidji
[2368.26 - 2372.82] in all their different products okay
[2369.64 - 2374.92] because companies put hidden ingredients
[2372.82 - 2378.28] in there companies put hidden
[2374.92 - 2381.34] ingredients you're allowed to legally
[2378.28 - 2384.94] place a certain percentage
[2381.34 - 2386.92] of unidentified hidden ingredients in
[2384.94 - 2389.32] the products and not
[2386.92 - 2392.32] put it on the bottle that's the rules
[2389.32 - 2393.76] the regulations Emoji says no we're not
[2392.32 - 2396.94] going to do that we're not going to play
[2393.76 - 2398.86] that game no caking agents no bonding
[2396.94 - 2401.20] agents know nothing hidden
[2398.86 - 2402.88] and that's why they're not only just the
[2401.20 - 2405.22] highest quality they do things no one's
[2402.88 - 2407.32] ever done and there's a reason it costs
[2405.22 - 2409.42] more money for the companies to do those
[2407.32 - 2410.68] things and it's smarter and the other
[2409.42 - 2412.06] companies I don't see them do either
[2410.68 - 2413.74] they're not smarter and they're not
[2412.06 - 2415.30] doing these things
[2413.74 - 2416.62] which is incredible and it's the highest
[2415.30 - 2419.26] quality stuff you can check out the
[2416.62 - 2421.84] medical meme directory
[2419.26 - 2423.28] or just memory.com
[2421.84 - 2425.14] and you know any company I've ever
[2423.28 - 2427.00] supported if they start changing their
[2425.14 - 2429.82] ways and they're going downhill it's
[2427.00 - 2432.60] like see you later whatever
[2429.82 - 2432.60] all right
[2433.78 - 2438.34] thanks for bringing up the Melatonin
[2436.54 - 2440.50] I tell like my friends about it all the
[2438.34 - 2443.08] time and everything triple Leo says
[2440.50 - 2445.90] laugh out loud my ex used to punch me
[2443.08 - 2449.02] when he couldn't sleep
[2445.90 - 2450.04] then would pretend he did it in his
[2449.02 - 2453.94] sleep
[2450.04 - 2456.40] I eventually caught on laugh out loud
[2453.94 - 2458.32] that's just like that's I feel really
[2456.40 - 2460.12] bad for you to go through that I really
[2458.32 - 2462.82] do
[2460.12 - 2466.18] so many people are
[2462.82 - 2468.82] I mean I can tell you that
[2466.18 - 2471.40] when people don't sleep the craziest
[2468.82 - 2473.44] stuff can happen it just can't and the
[2471.40 - 2475.66] most difficult stuff can happen
[2473.44 - 2478.66] for years I've seen people like I said
[2475.66 - 2480.04] there's this thing where if you
[2478.66 - 2482.14] I don't know if you've ever met somebody
[2480.04 - 2484.00] that's gone through this but there are
[2482.14 - 2487.00] people and I've seen people throughout
[2484.00 - 2489.40] the years that can go two days three
[2487.00 - 2491.20] days without sleeping and it's in agony
[2489.40 - 2492.64] it's a hell it's a torture where
[2491.20 - 2494.68] literally their whole body's rattling
[2492.64 - 2496.30] and shaking they're literally pacing
[2494.68 - 2498.10] it's three days later they haven't
[2496.30 - 2499.84] fallen asleep and when they finally fall
[2498.10 - 2502.06] asleep it's like literally a seizure
[2499.84 - 2504.48] sleep it's like you go into like a
[2502.06 - 2504.48] seizure
[2504.58 - 2507.58] foreign
[2510.94 - 2515.02] this technique gets even more helpful
[2513.04 - 2516.94] every time you do it because your brain
[2515.02 - 2518.26] learns the routine of this restorative
[2516.94 - 2520.48] exercise we're talking about resting the
[2518.26 - 2522.82] nerves if you just got on here and then
[2520.48 - 2526.06] I I went on some different directions
[2522.82 - 2527.62] it's all kind of related when your eyes
[2526.06 - 2529.90] are closed
[2527.62 - 2531.94] your neurotransmitters will start
[2529.90 - 2533.26] strengthening
[2531.94 - 2535.24] did you hear that
[2533.26 - 2536.80] if you lay there at night and you close
[2535.24 - 2537.82] your eyes and you're just resting your
[2536.80 - 2539.68] nerves and you're telling yourself
[2537.82 - 2540.76] you're resting your nerves
[2539.68 - 2542.32] you're strengthening your
[2540.76 - 2544.00] neurotransmitters
[2542.32 - 2545.98] your electrical impulses will start
[2544.00 - 2548.02] calming down
[2545.98 - 2550.54] your neurons will start resting from
[2548.02 - 2553.30] less activity even if you're still
[2550.54 - 2555.52] thinking about your day or you're angry
[2553.30 - 2557.74] about not sleeping
[2555.52 - 2560.62] the emotional centers of your brain will
[2557.74 - 2562.60] cease to have full control over you when
[2560.62 - 2564.52] your central nervous system knows you're
[2562.60 - 2567.64] taking care of it and giving it what it
[2564.52 - 2569.74] needs right then errant Rogue thoughts
[2567.64 - 2571.42] can't interfere with your nerve
[2569.74 - 2573.58] strengthening minute by minute this
[2571.42 - 2575.32] technique is like a quick charge for the
[2573.58 - 2578.20] central nervous system the nutrients
[2575.32 - 2581.02] from any Healing Foods you've eaten so
[2578.20 - 2582.88] far that day can be used that much more
[2581.02 - 2584.50] effectively while you rest your nerves
[2582.88 - 2587.82] it's this technique also helps
[2584.50 - 2587.82] strengthen the immune system
[2590.86 - 2595.12] now it's the time you've set aside for
[2592.84 - 2597.10] yourself is coming to an end of this
[2595.12 - 2598.78] exercise try to get in touch with the
[2597.10 - 2599.94] fact that your brain and nerves have now
[2598.78 - 2602.74] strengthened
[2599.94 - 2604.36] resonate with this realization that
[2602.74 - 2606.22] they're stronger than when you started
[2604.36 - 2608.64] and that each time you do this it's more
[2606.22 - 2608.64] effective
[2608.74 - 2612.10] if you're dealing with any okay this is
[2610.72 - 2614.92] an important paragraph coming up right
[2612.10 - 2617.62] here really important okay very
[2614.92 - 2619.72] important

[2639.10 - 2644.92] or brain fog

[2644.92 - 2649.36] techniques for you

[2680.43 - 2686.04] [Music]
[2683.82 - 2688.02] got all my stuff
[2686.04 - 2690.76] multitask
[2688.02 - 2692.38] multitasking I'm hoping Dr Nesbitt shows
[2690.76 - 2694.06] up tomorrow it's the 20th day he
[2692.38 - 2694.90] promised me he would he said that he
[2694.06 - 2697.54] would
[2694.90 - 2700.42] but he's got some surgeries
[2697.54 - 2702.70] and he's doing some psychiatry
[2700.42 - 2705.64] all right so what do we got three
[2702.70 - 2710.88] quarter cup
[2705.64 - 2710.88] fresh or thawed mango nice
[2713.38 - 2717.36] this is frozen mango right here
[2719.86 - 2723.66] Frozen mango
[2725.92 - 2730.02] sleep and recharging
[2736.48 - 2741.96] whoa getting some juice out of that
[2739.12 - 2741.96] Frozen mango
[2742.30 - 2745.12] you know how much Frozen mango you would
[2743.86 - 2747.82] have thrown into one of the other
[2745.12 - 2749.14] juicers it'd be insane I only put a
[2747.82 - 2751.72] little bit in and it's just it's
[2749.14 - 2755.68] squeezing the crap out of it
[2751.72 - 2758.38] you guys if you read thyroid healing
[2755.68 - 2760.60] I gotta get the book over here sometime
[2758.38 - 2762.64] if you read thyroid healing people heal
[2760.60 - 2764.20] through their Dreams and Nightmare
[2762.64 - 2766.68] section you know it's so really cool
[2764.20 - 2766.68] right there
[2769.30 - 2772.66] and I've always talked about this before
[2770.74 - 2774.10] what happens if you have bad dreams if
[2772.66 - 2775.66] you have nightmares you're healing
[2774.10 - 2777.88] through that
[2775.66 - 2781.62] keep that in mind your healing through
[2777.88 - 2781.62] those nightmares and those bad dreams
[2783.22 - 2789.88] all right let's go next one
[2785.08 - 2793.08] eighth of a cup of tightly packed Dill
[2789.88 - 2793.08] get some dill in here
[2793.72 - 2796.98] it's about good
[2797.32 - 2804.16] next quarter cup of chopped cucumber
[2802.00 - 2806.32] can't throw that one right
[2804.16 - 2809.34] not without hitting the juicer so I
[2806.32 - 2809.34] choked on that one
[2809.44 - 2816.30] but I didn't drop it on the floor
[2811.96 - 2816.30] quarter cup chopped cucumber
[2817.12 - 2820.50] let's send the cube through there
[2820.90 - 2828.18] foreign
[2823.48 - 2828.18] nice get you moving there you go
[2830.74 - 2836.88] next after that half cup roughly chopped
[2834.52 - 2836.88] lettuce
[2840.58 - 2843.36] and more than that
[2844.84 - 2849.48] squeeze into tightly packed
[2860.62 - 2862.80] foreign
[2880.60 - 2885.34] so you want to get that in there and
[2882.22 - 2889.30] then a half of teaspoon of pure maple
[2885.34 - 2890.92] syrup and here's what's incredible
[2889.30 - 2895.02] and I asked Spirit of compassion about
[2890.92 - 2895.02] this recipe the spring shot
[2896.26 - 2901.96] why would the maple syrup go in there
[2899.62 - 2904.42] is the maple syrup going in there to
[2901.96 - 2906.34] make it taste good
[2904.42 - 2908.56] if that's the case shouldn't maple syrup
[2906.34 - 2911.62] be in every single brain shot therapy
[2908.56 - 2914.08] you would think so right if the maple
[2911.62 - 2915.40] syrup is there to make it taste good the
[2914.08 - 2916.96] shot
[2915.40 - 2918.58] and maybe the maple syrup should be in
[2916.96 - 2920.56] everything it should be in every single
[2918.58 - 2922.18] brain shot there but no
[2920.56 - 2923.32] it's very compassion told me the maple
[2922.18 - 2925.60] syrup
[2923.32 - 2927.10] was to get glucose to the brain and then
[2925.60 - 2928.30] I said well okay glucose to the brain
[2927.10 - 2929.86] that would be good for everything
[2928.30 - 2931.42] shouldn't we just be a maple syrup all
[2929.86 - 2933.46] day these are the questions I asked
[2931.42 - 2934.54] because it's just you know that I'm the
[2933.46 - 2936.52] messenger I got to ask these questions
[2934.54 - 2938.74] goes down
[2936.52 - 2942.16] it's the trace minerals in the maple
[2938.74 - 2943.54] syrup and glucose combined with that
[2942.16 - 2946.30] form of glucose which is entirely
[2943.54 - 2947.80] different inside the mango combined with
[2946.30 - 2949.54] the trace minerals and the lettuce
[2947.80 - 2952.72] combined with
[2949.54 - 2955.84] phytochemical compounds in the
[2952.72 - 2958.06] um Dill combined with what's in the
[2955.84 - 2959.86] Cucumber it's that combination in the
[2958.06 - 2962.74] amounts that does something to the brain
[2959.86 - 2964.72] because these are literally an entirely
[2962.74 - 2967.30] different situation this isn't about a
[2964.72 - 2970.14] tasty juice shot that's why some of them
[2967.30 - 2970.14] just taste so bad
[2970.78 - 2975.18] it's really really incredible when you
[2972.52 - 2975.18] even think about it
[2978.46 - 2983.08] what
[2981.28 - 2983.94] music
[2983.08 - 2993.46] no way

[3064.32 - 3067.74] Sensation that I haven't had with this
[3066.48 - 3070.62] one
[3067.74 - 3073.82] I feel like
[3070.62 - 3073.82] I'm coming down
[3074.16 - 3078.60] and spirit says I didn't even finish
[3076.50 - 3080.04] this one right he says you still have to
[3078.60 - 3082.46] have a little bit of the maple syrup
[3080.04 - 3082.46] mixed in
[3082.94 - 3089.16] he says if you don't have maple syrup
[3085.86 - 3090.66] the mango might just be enough
[3089.16 - 3095.12] but he said you have to have the maple
[3090.66 - 3095.12] syrup and then it really kicks in harder

[3119.58 - 3128.82] because I'm actually relaxing so much
[3122.72 - 3131.34] [Music]
[3128.82 - 3133.62] oh my God I'm ready to go to bed

[3136.14 - 3140.70] insane way
[3138.54 - 3142.26] now it's really kicking in because then
[3140.70 - 3143.70] I had a little bit of the maple mixed in
[3142.26 - 3145.98] there oh my God

[3389.40 - 3395.10] streams the sweat dreams the wake in the
[3392.70 - 3397.92] night screaming dreams
[3395.10 - 3399.36] how many people wake up in the middle of
[3397.92 - 3402.32] the night screaming
[3399.36 - 3402.32] got a nightmare
[3402.36 - 3408.84] how can we make them go away
[3405.60 - 3411.24] are they punishment can we have some
[3408.84 - 3413.16] more blissed out dreams of tropical
[3411.24 - 3415.08] island vacations which could be a
[3413.16 - 3418.26] nightmare for some people
[3415.08 - 3420.06] some people tropical nightmares
[3418.26 - 3422.10] vacations
[3420.06 - 3423.90] I mean you hear about it out there like
[3422.10 - 3426.36] yeah some people go on a tropical
[3423.90 - 3428.64] vacation and something terrible happens
[3426.36 - 3430.86] like they could be a nightmare
[3428.64 - 3433.62] once you understand what's behind those
[3430.86 - 3436.34] bad dreams you won't want them to go
[3433.62 - 3436.34] anywhere
[3437.64 - 3441.78] I just said basically you don't want to
[3440.04 - 3443.82] lose your bad dreams once you understand
[3441.78 - 3446.52] what's behind those bad dreams you won't
[3443.82 - 3450.14] want them to go anywhere bad dreams are
[3446.52 - 3450.14] the Soul's way of healing
[3451.08 - 3456.96] bad dreams are the Soul's way of healing
[3454.20 - 3458.88] when we're awake we're not supposed to
[3456.96 - 3460.52] be Breaking Down the Walls of our
[3458.88 - 3464.16] emotional hurt
[3460.52 - 3466.14] when we are wounded a physical component
[3464.16 - 3468.24] in the brain puts up a barrier to
[3466.14 - 3471.24] protect us from constantly processing
[3468.24 - 3473.10] and reprocessing the pain so that we can
[3471.24 - 3475.62] be productive and move forward during
[3473.10 - 3478.38] our waking hours so we're not reliving
[3475.62 - 3479.76] all the pain see how it works all the
[3478.38 - 3481.56] hardships you had in your life the
[3479.76 - 3483.00] struggles you had in your life we're not
[3481.56 - 3484.32] supposed to be reliving it every single
[3483.00 - 3485.76] minute we won't even be able to be
[3484.32 - 3488.00] productive right we won't be able to
[3485.76 - 3488.00] push through
[3489.18 - 3494.52] so there's walls that are up that are
[3491.64 - 3498.32] naturally supposed to be there
[3494.52 - 3498.32] they're not walls of denial
[3498.48 - 3503.46] they're they're walls of divine
[3500.88 - 3505.74] protection
[3503.46 - 3508.50] these walls these emotional walls inside
[3505.74 - 3511.26] of our brain are emotional walls of
[3508.50 - 3514.26] divine protection
[3511.26 - 3516.48] so we're not suffering every minute all
[3514.26 - 3518.28] day long so all of our hardships the
[3516.48 - 3519.96] Betrayal the broken trust all the crap
[3518.28 - 3523.74] that's happened in our lives all the
[3519.96 - 3525.84] losses all the struggles if we live in
[3523.74 - 3527.64] that every single second we won't be
[3525.84 - 3530.40] able to do anything
[3527.64 - 3532.56] so a lot of that gets tucked away it
[3530.40 - 3535.68] gets tucked away the old stuff gets
[3532.56 - 3538.02] tucked away there is a natural wall it's
[3535.68 - 3540.60] not a wall of denial it's a wall of
[3538.02 - 3543.66] divine protection
[3540.60 - 3547.14] while some conscious processing is
[3543.66 - 3549.68] healthy and necessary it's not meant to
[3547.14 - 3549.68] haunt us
[3550.14 - 3555.90] we're not
[3551.58 - 3558.90] supposed to be haunted constantly about
[3555.90 - 3560.16] things we've gone through or we're not
[3558.90 - 3562.92] going to be able to function so good
[3560.16 - 3565.46] there's a Divine protective wall that's
[3562.92 - 3569.18] built inside of our brain it's both
[3565.46 - 3569.18] Supernatural and natural
[3570.84 - 3575.28] the time to process that pain is in our
[3573.72 - 3577.44] sleep by the way
[3575.28 - 3583.40] when we're sleeping
[3577.44 - 3583.40] that's the time to process our pain
[3585.42 - 3591.36] when we're not conscious
[3588.48 - 3593.94] that's when we process that pain that's
[3591.36 - 3596.16] what's incredible this is blowing my
[3593.94 - 3598.86] mind over and over again this is thyroid
[3596.16 - 3600.72] healing Spirit of compassions put put
[3598.86 - 3602.10] this in here years ago this is
[3600.72 - 3604.26] mind-blowing information you won't hear
[3602.10 - 3606.30] this anywhere else of course but this
[3604.26 - 3608.22] book has been out and millions of copies
[3606.30 - 3611.54] have gotten around the world so people
[3608.22 - 3611.54] could be talking about it now
[3611.58 - 3615.92] and not citing it back to thyroid
[3613.56 - 3615.92] healing
[3616.56 - 3622.26] they're not walls of denial these walls
[3618.90 - 3624.84] are Divine protection they're there
[3622.26 - 3627.42] so things in our life and in our past
[3624.84 - 3631.76] don't haunt us the time to process that
[3627.42 - 3631.76] pain is in our sleep your nightmares
[3632.28 - 3637.92] your nighttime nightmares your dreams of
[3635.94 - 3639.84] sadness your dreams of frustration your
[3637.92 - 3641.76] dreams of betrayal your dreams of broken
[3639.84 - 3644.76] trust your dreams when you're sleeping
[3641.76 - 3645.78] at night a pain and sorrow and loss are
[3644.76 - 3648.92] there
[3645.78 - 3648.92] for a reason
[3649.56 - 3653.34] their time to process those very things
[3651.78 - 3655.32] that you have gone through you guys is
[3653.34 - 3657.36] in our sleep
[3655.32 - 3660.36] when we're not conscious
[3657.36 - 3662.58] the emotional walls come down so the
[3660.36 - 3665.22] soul can do its cleanup and repair work
[3662.58 - 3667.50] when you're sleeping at night the
[3665.22 - 3668.88] emotional Wall comes down it's not
[3667.50 - 3670.32] supposed to come down during the day
[3668.88 - 3672.12] when you're trying to function and drive
[3670.32 - 3673.62] a car and live your life and work or do
[3672.12 - 3676.92] whatever you're doing
[3673.62 - 3678.72] being creative painting whatever it's
[3676.92 - 3681.54] supposed to come down the Walls when
[3678.72 - 3683.76] you're sleeping so your soul can do its
[3681.54 - 3686.94] clean up and repair work
[3683.76 - 3689.70] this means that all sorts of difficult
[3686.94 - 3692.46] emotions get stirred up and they work
[3689.70 - 3694.44] themselves out through our dreams it's
[3692.46 - 3695.94] meant to be worked out through our
[3694.44 - 3699.86] dreams
[3695.94 - 3703.94] we're supposed to heal emotional injury
[3699.86 - 3703.94] through our dreams
[3705.54 - 3710.82] if this didn't happen frustration anger
[3708.30 - 3714.26] fear betrayal guilt experience any of
[3710.82 - 3714.26] that I experienced that every day
[3714.96 - 3721.14] you ever experienced any of that stuff
[3717.90 - 3723.96] yeah I experienced betrayal every day
[3721.14 - 3726.92] it's like my being of my existence or
[3723.96 - 3726.92] whatever you want to call it
[3730.20 - 3735.24] if this didn't happen frustration I
[3732.54 - 3738.60] experienced frustration of course anger
[3735.24 - 3740.64] sure fear sure betrayal guilt and
[3738.60 - 3742.32] humiliation would build up and build up
[3740.64 - 3744.12] and build up within us until they
[3742.32 - 3746.88] overpower the strength of the walls
[3744.12 - 3749.82] holding them in place that means
[3746.88 - 3751.68] if you don't heal frustration anger fear
[3749.82 - 3753.30] betrayal guilt and humiliation if you
[3751.68 - 3757.20] don't heal
[3753.30 - 3759.48] the wounds that are behind things and if
[3757.20 - 3762.84] you don't heal those in your sleep then
[3759.48 - 3764.64] they can come out during the day
[3762.84 - 3765.90] that wall comes down during the day you
[3764.64 - 3767.46] don't want that you want the wall to
[3765.90 - 3770.28] come down when you're sleeping that is
[3767.46 - 3772.32] part of the Divine protection aspect of
[3770.28 - 3775.58] our design
[3772.32 - 3775.58] Spirit of compassion says
[3776.58 - 3779.82] if we didn't do this frustration anger
[3778.62 - 3781.50] of fear of betrayal guilt and
[3779.82 - 3782.82] humiliation would build up and build up
[3781.50 - 3784.62] and build up within us until they
[3782.82 - 3786.36] overpower the strength of the walls
[3784.62 - 3787.74] holding them in place and took over our
[3786.36 - 3790.20] waking lives
[3787.74 - 3791.88] it doesn't take over my Waking Life life
[3790.20 - 3794.58] even though I get betrayed or whatever
[3791.88 - 3796.38] it is or whatever's happening out there
[3794.58 - 3799.68] there's so much hate on medical medium
[3796.38 - 3801.86] and all that it doesn't take over my
[3799.68 - 3801.86] life
[3802.68 - 3808.50] because it heals through my dreams
[3805.32 - 3811.16] that's where the Wall comes down when
[3808.50 - 3811.16] you're sleeping
[3813.18 - 3817.62] so
[3814.44 - 3821.54] during my waking days
[3817.62 - 3821.54] people say I'm a pretty happy guy
[3822.12 - 3826.44] you know and so what's funny is because
[3824.22 - 3828.12] I'm being productive um getting the
[3826.44 - 3829.32] information out on working hard whatever
[3828.12 - 3832.92] it is
[3829.32 - 3835.32] right I don't let those things take over
[3832.92 - 3837.48] and dominate my life
[3835.32 - 3839.22] I heal those through my dreams at night
[3837.48 - 3841.70] like Spirit of compassion is saying we
[3839.22 - 3841.70] all do
[3842.22 - 3847.68] instead our dreams release them this
[3845.16 - 3850.26] nightly house cleaning aided by the
[3847.68 - 3851.58] angel of sleep and if you don't believe
[3850.26 - 3853.14] in the Angels if you don't believe in
[3851.58 - 3855.48] angels
[3853.14 - 3859.16] then maybe it's something else a gnome
[3855.48 - 3859.16] maybe it's something else of sleep
[3859.20 - 3863.28] maybe you just think God helps us sleep
[3861.84 - 3865.38] whatever it is that you believe you
[3863.28 - 3868.02] don't believe in angels that's okay
[3865.38 - 3869.82] but our dreams released this nightly
[3868.02 - 3872.28] house cleaning aided by the angel of
[3869.82 - 3874.50] sleep and the angel of Dreams many times
[3872.28 - 3876.90] when people take melatonin it allows
[3874.50 - 3880.26] them to dream when they weren't able to
[3876.90 - 3884.28] dream before and that helps people to
[3880.26 - 3886.20] heal their emotions in their sleep
[3884.28 - 3889.02] by the way
[3886.20 - 3891.66] nightmares are not a bad sign
[3889.02 - 3893.70] that's a sign that the brain that your
[3891.66 - 3896.18] emotional your soul your state is
[3893.70 - 3896.18] healing
[3896.46 - 3900.66] this nightly house cleaning aided by the
[3898.62 - 3902.82] angel of sleep the angel of dreams and
[3900.66 - 3904.32] the unknown Angels helps the unknown
[3902.82 - 3906.90] angels
[3904.32 - 3909.36] the unknown angels
[3906.90 - 3912.30] helps us face what's going on in life
[3909.36 - 3916.08] without becoming scared by it
[3912.30 - 3918.78] sometimes dreams have staying power
[3916.08 - 3920.94] a dream can stick to you all day or even
[3918.78 - 3923.28] longer even years
[3920.94 - 3925.26] can I just ask you guys something
[3923.28 - 3928.26] have you been in a situation where a
[3925.26 - 3930.72] dream has stayed with you for years a
[3928.26 - 3933.24] dream that you had a long time ago a
[3930.72 - 3936.80] dream that you might have had and it has
[3933.24 - 3936.80] stayed with you for years
[3937.02 - 3942.60] these dreams can be confusing we often
[3939.84 - 3943.62] dream of family and other loved ones for
[3942.60 - 3946.20] example
[3943.62 - 3949.08] with the swirl of emotions
[3946.20 - 3951.36] even if everything is going fine in a
[3949.08 - 3953.64] waking relationship a dream can bring a
[3951.36 - 3955.56] feeling of hurt or
[3953.64 - 3957.30] loneliness
[3955.56 - 3958.50] and it's okay if you don't remember your
[3957.30 - 3960.78] dreams either
[3958.50 - 3963.20] that's okay too there's nothing wrong
[3960.78 - 3963.20] with that
[3963.30 - 3967.68] even if everything is going fine in a
[3965.64 - 3970.62] waking relationship a dream can bring a
[3967.68 - 3973.98] feeling of hurt or uneasiness
[3970.62 - 3976.74] or if it's a relationship where there's
[3973.98 - 3978.96] been some challenge or distance dreams
[3976.74 - 3982.32] can bring up the Old Wounds making us
[3978.96 - 3984.18] contemplate what went wrong years ago to
[3982.32 - 3987.12] cause the pain
[3984.18 - 3989.70] we may wake from a dream feeling like we
[3987.12 - 3992.64] did something wrong you were processing
[3989.70 - 3995.66] at night so you don't have to do it in
[3992.64 - 3995.66] your Waking Life
[4000.80 - 4004.34] even if a relationship where there's
[4002.66 - 4006.86] been some challenge or some distance
[4004.34 - 4009.32] dreams can bring up Old Wounds making us
[4006.86 - 4011.84] contemplate what went wrong years ago to
[4009.32 - 4015.14] cause the pain we may wake from a dream
[4011.84 - 4017.48] feeling like we did something wrong
[4015.14 - 4020.12] or like we weren't heard or perceived
[4017.48 - 4025.06] right as we painfully try to decode what
[4020.12 - 4025.06] it means we can be left feeling empty
[4026.18 - 4031.52] all of this is healthy I've heard from
[4028.64 - 4033.74] people who told me that a bad dream made
[4031.52 - 4035.96] them pick up the phone and call a family
[4033.74 - 4038.18] friend
[4035.96 - 4040.16] or a friend or a family member they
[4038.18 - 4041.78] hadn't talked to in years that's what
[4040.16 - 4044.12] bad dreams can do
[4041.78 - 4046.34] Juliet says I have bad dreams almost
[4044.12 - 4048.80] every night which makes sense since I
[4046.34 - 4051.64] have been through trauma and PTSD it
[4048.80 - 4051.64] makes a lot of sense
[4052.88 - 4056.90] people have bad dreams about an old
[4055.10 - 4058.76] family friend or something and they
[4056.90 - 4060.56] contact them and it's amazing about how
[4058.76 - 4062.36] this works
[4060.56 - 4065.54] see
[4062.36 - 4067.28] and dash says I did not dream for over
[4065.54 - 4070.18] 10 years thank you for changing that
[4067.28 - 4070.18] incredible
[4070.82 - 4076.10] any empty feeling is because toxic
[4073.28 - 4077.90] wounds and emotions left us or started
[4076.10 - 4081.02] to leave us that's the empty feeling we
[4077.90 - 4084.40] can get to in our sleep reducing our
[4081.02 - 4084.40] storage of Bank of hurt
[4084.56 - 4090.14] even though we think it's the opposite
[4087.08 - 4091.82] bad dreams rejuvenate us even when we
[4090.14 - 4094.34] think it's the opposite a bad dream
[4091.82 - 4095.54] rejuvenates us how insane is that so
[4094.34 - 4097.34] cool
[4095.54 - 4099.86] they remind us that there are people
[4097.34 - 4102.74] places and things in our lives that may
[4099.86 - 4105.68] need some attention so we can move on
[4102.74 - 4108.40] bad dreams don't close doors they open
[4105.68 - 4108.40] doors
[4109.10 - 4112.90] I think I'm gonna quote that you guys
[4113.00 - 4117.22] think I'm gonna remember that one okay
[4117.62 - 4123.74] I'll make a medical medium quota that
[4120.02 - 4125.12] bad dreams don't open doors they try if
[4123.74 - 4127.60] I'm going to do the quote can I get the
[4125.12 - 4127.60] quote right
[4128.06 - 4133.54] bad dreams don't close doors they open
[4131.00 - 4133.54] doors
[4133.76 - 4140.18] I love doing live shows
[4137.06 - 4142.16] to create new beginnings
[4140.18 - 4143.96] I should add that to the quote too they
[4142.16 - 4146.66] create new beginnings
[4143.96 - 4149.60] even if you're not aware of what that
[4146.66 - 4151.88] new beginning is it's happening
[4149.60 - 4153.56] far down the road you can quote all of
[4151.88 - 4156.14] medical medium books right like if you
[4153.56 - 4158.90] you can turn quotes into like every line
[4156.14 - 4163.36] is always but it's mind-blowing
[4158.90 - 4163.36] Spirit of compassion did a fantastic job
[4163.52 - 4167.24] even if you're not aware of what that
[4165.38 - 4168.92] new beginning is it's happening far down
[4167.24 - 4172.04] the roads you may have the perspective
[4168.92 - 4174.92] to see what opportunity a bad dream
[4172.04 - 4176.96] led to you and your way LED
[4174.92 - 4179.60] to your life
[4176.96 - 4182.08] we wish each other sweet dreams sweet
[4179.60 - 4182.08] dreams
[4183.02 - 4187.52] sweet dreams
[4186.08 - 4191.50] or if you're a mobster or something
[4187.52 - 4191.50] sweet dreams right whatever
[4191.96 - 4197.92] it's pretty funny
[4193.46 - 4197.92] we wish each other sweet dreams
[4198.44 - 4203.54] back then all those years ago I put this
[4200.72 - 4206.86] in the books but people say I'm just a
[4203.54 - 4206.86] fruit and vegetable guy
[4207.56 - 4212.36] and the rest of it I've
[4209.78 - 4215.26] they have fruit and vegetables man and
[4212.36 - 4215.26] then I got it all wrong
[4219.14 - 4225.58] but they got it wrong
[4222.14 - 4225.58] man do they got it wrong
[4225.80 - 4229.94] we wish each other sweet dreams when
[4227.84 - 4231.98] really we should wish each other healing
[4229.94 - 4233.60] dreams we're not supposed to say sweet
[4231.98 - 4235.40] dreams we're supposed to say healing
[4233.60 - 4239.44] dreams
[4235.40 - 4239.44] I wish you healing dreams
[4241.52 - 4246.98] to advance the soul
[4243.80 - 4250.70] men the heart and simply
[4246.98 - 4253.40] empty yourself or harmful emotions you
[4250.70 - 4256.34] don't want every dream to be perfect and
[4253.40 - 4258.64] tranquil and Flowery you don't want your
[4256.34 - 4258.64] dream
[4260.06 - 4265.82] to be a Wonderland
[4263.30 - 4267.98] and only that you want your dreams to
[4265.82 - 4269.84] have some hardship in them because you
[4267.98 - 4271.88] want the good stuff to be happening when
[4269.84 - 4273.98] you're awake you want the bad stuff to
[4271.88 - 4276.74] happen when you're asleep if our dream
[4273.98 - 4279.86] life if our dream lives were total
[4276.74 - 4283.60] fantasy sleeping would be the only thing
[4279.86 - 4283.60] we'd ever want to do
[4284.00 - 4287.84] now there are Sinister people in the
[4285.98 - 4289.82] world that have existed throughout
[4287.84 - 4292.22] history I love when Spirit of compassion
[4289.82 - 4293.96] does stuff like this
[4292.22 - 4295.16] or talked about stuff like this and say
[4293.96 - 4297.02] things like this these books are
[4295.16 - 4299.12] incredible
[4297.02 - 4300.80] now there and this is years ago right we
[4299.12 - 4302.96] know how the world's getting even more
[4300.80 - 4305.18] Sinister I mean
[4302.96 - 4305.90] now there are Sinister people in the
[4305.18 - 4309.02] world
[4305.90 - 4311.72] they have existed throughout history
[4309.02 - 4314.84] these cold-hearted people can go through
[4311.72 - 4316.88] life without one nightmare
[4314.84 - 4318.26] if you look it doesn't mean you're a
[4316.88 - 4320.78] Sinister person just because you never
[4318.26 - 4323.06] had a bad dream once in your entire life
[4320.78 - 4326.18] but there are Sinister people where they
[4323.06 - 4329.06] don't have those bad dreams that's an
[4326.18 - 4330.98] indication of how cut off they are from
[4329.06 - 4333.02] processing negative experiences like
[4330.98 - 4335.36] pain and suffering since they don't deal
[4333.02 - 4337.88] with their pain while they sleep they
[4335.36 - 4339.62] hold on to it in their waking lives and
[4337.88 - 4341.96] they want to inflict that opinion on
[4339.62 - 4345.50] others which book page is this lag
[4341.96 - 4347.36] on YouTube it's page 260 of thyroid
[4345.50 - 4350.48] healing
[4347.36 - 4352.28] yes on the flip side you can have the
[4350.48 - 4354.38] most compassionate generous loving
[4352.28 - 4358.12] person who can't go a night without
[4354.38 - 4358.12] dreaming something unpleasant
[4359.72 - 4364.58] believe it or not this is the healthier
[4362.36 - 4367.52] process
[4364.58 - 4369.50] because this person is so tuned in she's
[4367.52 - 4371.66] a witness to other struggles she
[4369.50 - 4373.76] experiences the range of human suffering
[4371.66 - 4375.44] and so when she checks out for the night
[4373.76 - 4378.98] her brain needs
[4375.44 - 4381.14] to protect her from becoming haunted by
[4378.98 - 4383.18] it in her Waking Life
[4381.14 - 4386.06] this is just I'm trying to re-digest
[4383.18 - 4389.90] this information she may dream of
[4386.06 - 4391.58] schoolyard bullies and natural disasters
[4389.90 - 4394.04] and War zones
[4391.58 - 4396.56] and it's all for her benefit so that
[4394.04 - 4400.10] rather than waking up bitter that she
[4396.56 - 4403.10] has to leave some Fantastical fantasy
[4400.10 - 4404.96] dream and face a harsh World instead she
[4403.10 - 4406.76] can wake up or leave to leave those
[4404.96 - 4410.98] tough dreams behind and ready to
[4406.76 - 4410.98] continue Her Sacred work of compassion
[4411.26 - 4416.30] here's one of the last paragraphs right
[4413.42 - 4419.00] here this is deep this is deep
[4416.30 - 4421.96] I was if there's ever a term to use that
[4419.00 - 4421.96] would be the term right now
[4423.20 - 4429.88] I love this paragraph right here
[4426.08 - 4429.88] let me be clear
[4430.04 - 4434.54] that having good dreams does not make
[4432.44 - 4436.58] you a bad person
[4434.54 - 4439.34] let me be clear that's what Spirit of
[4436.58 - 4441.56] compassion said that's what I wrote
[4439.34 - 4444.44] of course not
[4441.56 - 4446.84] it's all about balance in addition to
[4444.44 - 4449.66] those memorable bad dreams we're meant
[4446.84 - 4452.00] to have beautiful dreams as well the
[4449.66 - 4454.52] Angels sometimes grant us dreams of
[4452.00 - 4458.06] transcendence and Hope
[4454.52 - 4461.42] sometimes our dreams are premonitions or
[4458.06 - 4464.24] messages or creative inspiration
[4461.42 - 4466.28] some nights some nights we have mild bad
[4464.24 - 4468.50] dreams in which we process emotions
[4466.28 - 4471.86] though we're spared from remembering
[4468.50 - 4475.64] what happened Come Morning other times
[4471.86 - 4478.58] we get to visit with we get a visit with
[4475.64 - 4480.14] a deceased loved one in our dreams has
[4478.58 - 4482.24] that ever happened to you I just want to
[4480.14 - 4483.92] ask you guys that
[4482.24 - 4486.02] have you ever had
[4483.92 - 4488.72] you were sleeping and you had a dream
[4486.02 - 4490.90] and a deceased loved one came into the
[4488.72 - 4490.90] dream
[4491.60 - 4493.78] foreign
[4494.66 - 4498.16] just remember to welcome
[4498.86 - 4505.28] the dreams that challenge you
[4501.86 - 4508.58] they are doing you a great service as
[4505.28 - 4511.10] your body heals during slumber
[4508.58 - 4513.38] they are not a punishment or judgment
[4511.10 - 4514.22] they are helping you become your best
[4513.38 - 4517.46] self
[4514.22 - 4519.98] what the afterward is your Soul's gold I
[4517.46 - 4521.78] don't know if you guys read that
[4519.98 - 4523.40] rising out of the ashes says I love that
[4521.78 - 4525.38] you say
[4523.40 - 4527.84] she in the books
[4525.38 - 4529.34] otherwise it's always he and other books
[4527.84 - 4531.56] can I say something about that Rising on
[4529.34 - 4533.74] the ashes I got a lot of flack from that
[4531.56 - 4533.74] one
[4533.84 - 4538.70] from what
[4535.88 - 4540.38] they say and I can't I can't be quoted
[4538.70 - 4543.56] on this because I don't know if someone
[4540.38 - 4545.84] did it before but before medical medium
[4543.56 - 4548.26] books it said that no one puts she in
[4545.84 - 4548.26] front of he
[4548.44 - 4552.50] and the medical medium books were the
[4550.70 - 4554.54] first books published where he was at
[4552.50 - 4557.14] where he was after she where it was she
[4554.54 - 4557.14] in front of he
[4557.42 - 4563.24] it's her in front of him
[4559.88 - 4565.52] and all the other books I was told
[4563.24 - 4568.64] and even my publisher said they said we
[4565.52 - 4571.76] think no one's done that before we think
[4568.64 - 4574.94] it was always him and her
[4571.76 - 4578.30] right he and she
[4574.94 - 4580.70] or always he and the medical meme books
[4578.30 - 4582.50] were her and him
[4580.70 - 4584.00] the first time they think in publishing
[4582.50 - 4585.44] history that's what we believe I mean
[4584.00 - 4587.18] maybe there was one book somewhere that
[4585.44 - 4590.12] was 100 years ago I don't know but I'm
[4587.18 - 4592.52] saying that's what we we've learned
[4590.12 - 4596.54] Lori's page and that was that was really
[4592.52 - 4599.54] cool um Lori says yes I a dream I had
