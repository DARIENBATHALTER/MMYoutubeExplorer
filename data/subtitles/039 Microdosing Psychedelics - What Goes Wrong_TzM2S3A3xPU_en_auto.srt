your

41
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:17,480
subconsciousness in your Consciousness

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:44,360

50
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,319

51
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:49,440

overdosing that's another powerful word

53
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,519
term that's etched in our mind

54
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:56,400
Consciousness and subconsciousness so if

55
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:59,800
you're somebody that played around with

56
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,920
recreational drugs or still do you know

57
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:05,799
know not to

58
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:08,040
OD you know it in your soul and your

59
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:11,680
being that it's not a good thing you're

60
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:14,400
cautious to how much including just weed

61
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,400
how much weed you smoke in a day and

62
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:20,239
then you hear it out there you read

63
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:23,280
stories you hear it on the news somebody

64
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:27,840
overdosed this person overdosed last

65
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:30,599
night they died this person ODed it's

66
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,959
scary it could mean death

67
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:37,239
and that resides in the Consciousness as

68
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:41,920
well the term OD overdosing

69
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:44,280
overdosed connects to dying death but

70
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:47,920
when people don't feel good in general

71
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:51,239
they're struggling mentally emotionally

72
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:53,760
they got health issues they want a

73
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:57,480
remedy they want

74
00:03:53,760 --> 00:04:00,040
medicine some type of medicine and you

75
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:02,840
ask anybody who does Recreation ational

76
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:05,319
drugs at one time in their life or they

77
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:07,879
still do it now and you ask them why are

78
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:10,720
they doing it so how come you're doing

79
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:14,400
it and you'll get an answer I don't feel

80
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:16,959
good I feel sick I got anxiety I have

81
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,880
depression I have

82
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:22,639
depersonalization I have all kinds of

83
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:27,759
mental issues I have severe emotional

84
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:30,199
trauma I have Old Wounds hurt pain and

85
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,800
even people who didn't start that way

86
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:34,160
they didn't have any of that at least

87
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:37,199
they didn't think they did they got into

88
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,680
recreational drugs and they were taking

89
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:42,120
something and over time they took more

90
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:45,039
of it more of it than it was interfering

91
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:47,680
with their life making life more

92
00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:50,080
difficult and then got to a point where

93
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,720
they needed help and then someone would

94
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,600
say why are you doing it and they'd be

95
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:57,240
like

96
00:04:52,600 --> 00:05:00,880
well I just life's been really hard I

97
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:03,000
have a lot of problems and I just went

98
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,280
and grabbed it and started using it it

99
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,120
made me feel better but at the start

100
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:10,800
they were just partying and the reason

101
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:13,880
they took more and more of it and kept

102
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,160
doing it wasn't just the addiction part

103
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:19,560
it was because they were self-medicating

104
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:22,440
they were looking for medicine they were

105
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:24,960
self-medicating and then there's people

106
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:27,479
that say they have self- control they

107
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:31,639
can control their addiction they can

108
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:33,680
control their partying they can control

109
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:37,039
how many pills they take that the doctor

110
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,919
gave them and then there's people that

111
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:41,960
don't have

112
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:45,120
self-control it's endless

113
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:49,880
consumption Nothing Stops them but

114
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:51,720
either way everybody knows there's power

115
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:53,600
in the word

116
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,720
dosing

117
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:59,919
dosages

118
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:03,240
ODed dose so no matter where ever

119
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:05,080
someone is at in their life whether they

120
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:07,120
took something in the past whether

121
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:10,280
they're on a medication now in the

122
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:13,720
present whether they feel pretty good

123
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:17,160
whether they don't there's a word that

124
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:20,319
catches their eye and it's micro doing

125
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:23,720
right when someone says it I'm micro

126
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:27,319

127
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:30,639
is like ah what and all kinds of things

128
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:32,800
run through their mind one is how come

00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,360
the doctor never told me that how come

130
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,919
the doctor handing me a medication

131
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:38,800
didn't say we're going to make you micro

133
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:44,639

136
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,919
when I was partying 20 years ago how

137
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,479
come I never heard that before when I

138
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:55,599
was hanging out with a bunch of people

139
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:57,759
and they're all doing drugs many years

140
00:06:55,599 --> 00:07:00,319
ago in college and how come no one was

141
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:03,639
saying how about micro do hey you should

ecstasy it's mind-blowing micro doing

145
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:14,160
the term instantly you also think wait a

146
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:17,440
minute is this scientific is science

147
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:20,680
involved did some scientific body figure

148
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:23,639
out that if you reduce the dose or make

149
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:26,720
it appropriate in some way leveled or

150
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:29,840
measured that we can take what we want

151
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,319
and get something out of it and since

152
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,240
your doctor's not going to still say

153
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:34,639
anything about micro doing the

154
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,440
alternative doctor is not going to say

155
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,520
anything about micro doing your

156
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,280
chiropractor is not going to say

157
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,840
anything about micro doing you're not

158
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:45,000
going to really hear about it anywhere

159
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:48,199
besides kind of on the scene that's

160
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:51,240
where you hear it on the scene and then

161
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:54,520
you like it because it gives you a sense

162
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:58,319
of control because you can't trust

163
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:59,919
yourself you know that in the past heck

164
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,120
people can't trust themselves with a bar

165
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:03,000
of chocolate they'll gobble the whole

166
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:05,759
thing

167
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,960
down and then you think this must be

168
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:10,440
some kind of

169
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:12,800
controlled design it's micro doing

170
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:15,759
someone else can handle it they can hand

171
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:18,120
me that little tiny dosage and say we're

172
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,520
micro doing and then I can take that

173
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:23,280
tiny dosage and take it with confidence

174
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:26,080
feeling like there's control over it and

175
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:28,879
I'm not going overboard I'm not pushing

176
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:33,320
it too hard or too far there's something

177
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:36,159
about that it feels safe there seems to

178
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:39,919
be some type of safety mechanism built

179
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:42,760
into this everything is okay if you

180
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:44,959
micro do it that's the message that

181
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:48,040
comes through and then you hear a bad

182
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:50,760
stories of the past or you remember

183
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:53,800
certain stories that somebody told you

184
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:57,440
of the past or you experienced something

185
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:59,279
in the past such as a bad trip you

186
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,360
remember a guy having a bad trip you you

187
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:04,040
remember this girl having a bad trip you

188
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:06,160
remember somebody having a bad trip they

189
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:09,040
went too far they were injured by

190
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,920
something whether it was a large dosage

191
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,079
of

192
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:15,839
iasa whether it was a large dosage siloc

193
00:09:13,079 --> 00:09:18,279
cybin whether it was a large dosage that

194
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:21,240
night of ecstasy whatever it is you

195
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:24,519
heard they had a bad run it really hurt

196
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:30,079
them they were injured by it and then

197
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:33,279
you think aha that aha moment micro do

198
00:09:30,079 --> 00:09:35,640
we figured it out the world figured it

199
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:37,720
out everybody did science must have

200
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:40,959
figured it out all the shamans must have

201
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:44,880
figured it out everybody anybody

202
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:49,120
involved people must have somehow come

203
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:52,440
to some conclusion that we have

204
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:54,920
masterminded we have found the key to

205
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:57,200
all of it it's not about what we did

206
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:59,600
before we were doing it all wrong it's

207
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,760
micro doing that's the answer now now

208
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,480
and it's proven there must be something

209
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:07,399
behind it it's ingenious it works it

210
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:11,720
feels safe and then you hear another

211
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:14,640
term or word associated with micro doing

212
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:16,760
attached to it it's called The Plant

213
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,800
medicine you hear that word plant

214
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:22,519
medicine and suddenly you're like whoa

215
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:25,279
and the term plant medicine holds power

216
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:27,600
because we know plants are important we

217
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:30,360
know plants do have medicine in them one

218
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,880
way or another and we feel comfortable

219
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:34,800
with the term plant

220
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:37,160
medicine that word plant and that word

221
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:40,920
medicine combined with micro doing and

222
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:43,399
we're sold we're done sign me up what's

223
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:46,200
interesting is we only use that term

224
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:48,120
plant medicine or people in the health

225
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:51,079
movement only use that term plant

226
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:55,839
medicine when it's about something that

227
00:10:51,079 --> 00:10:57,839
is scary something that is toxic

228
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:02,240
something that may not be good for you

229
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:04,680
in small dosages or certainly not large

230
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,680
dosages something that could even be

231
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:09,560
dangerous and that's where the term

232
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:12,079
plant medicine falls in the term plant

233
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:15,120
medicine around substances that are

234
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:16,880
toxic reminds me of a carjacker you just

235
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,040
call a car

236
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:22,600
borrower and the strange thing is

237
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:25,480
there's no scale from 1 to 10 on how

238
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:28,680
mean or bad that carjacker is just like

239
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:31,760
there's no scale between 1 to 10 on how

240
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:34,079
talkx IC that plant medicine is some

241
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:37,560
plant medicine could be considered soloc

242
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:40,360
cybin mushrooms and one mushroom can

243
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:42,360
pack a wall up versus another mushroom

244
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:45,120
that can just have you barfing and sick

245
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:47,200
all night and another mushroom that

246
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,560
could have your liver shutting down in 7

247
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:52,200
days or your kidneys on the edge of

248
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:55,480
failure but yet you could pack it all up

249
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:58,360
to plant medicine that's all just like a

250
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:59,480
carjacker one carjacker might punch your

251
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,959
window in

252
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:05,040
grab you pull you through the window cut

253
00:12:01,959 --> 00:12:07,880
you up really bad hop in the car and

254
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:10,320
drive it over you on the way out another

255
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:13,160
carjacker might just come up to you and

256
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:16,160
say Sir ma'am get out of the car I'm

257
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:19,320
taking it or just like that one mushroom

258
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:21,279
that almost caused liver failure or that

259
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:24,399
one mushroom that almost shut down your

260
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:26,480
kidneys after a week the carjacker just

261
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:29,120
puts a gun to the window shoots a bullet

262
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:31,920
through it hits your face and then takes

263
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:34,440
your car there's no scale there's no

264
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:37,320
measurement there's no way to measure it

265
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:40,440
it's just the term plant medicine the

266
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:43,240
thing is really the term plant medicine

267
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:46,240
should be all about fruits leafy greens

268
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:49,959
herbs wild Foods vegetables that are not

269
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:53,480
mind altering in a bad way or adrenaline

270
00:12:49,959 --> 00:12:55,920
surging in a bad way sources of plant

271
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:58,199
chemical compounds that actually help us

272
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,519
heal plant medicine should be about

273
00:12:58,199 --> 00:13:03,120
blackberri

274
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:07,120
wild blueberries lemon balm Rosemary

275
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:09,519
Ginger thyme celery spinach cilantro

276
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:12,000
shitake mushrooms that's just a few

277
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:15,160
example instead plant medicine is being

278
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,600
used to give benediction to psilocybin

279
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:22,959
mushrooms also known as magic mushrooms

280
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:25,360
or shrooms iasa or even cacao matcha tea

281
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:28,440
green tea and then if you leave plant

282
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,720
medicine you go into toad medicine frog

283
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,720
poison

284
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:35,000
the alternative and conventional

285
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:37,360
medicine world has a lot in common with

286
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,560
the micro doing world and plant medicine

287
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:43,600
world what's in common they both don't

288
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:46,839
know why people are sick still bold

289
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:49,560
statement true and there's a reason for

290
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:52,360
it no one knows why someone has anxiety

291
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:57,480
depression bipolar disorder

292
00:13:52,360 --> 00:14:00,160
OCD nobody knows why they have it no one

293
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:03,519
knows why people really have brain fog

294
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:06,800
fatigue or a marad of other neurological

295
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:09,079
symptoms nobody knows why someone has

296
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:11,600
autoimmune no one knows why someone's

297
00:14:09,079 --> 00:14:13,959
living with a painful chronic condition

298
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:16,880
and chronic symptoms that plague them

299
00:14:13,959 --> 00:14:18,639
for years and even decades in their life

300
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:21,600
conventional and alternative medicine

301
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:25,320
don't know why someone has anxiety and

302
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:28,360
plant medicine and micro doing world

303
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:31,600
don't know why someone has anxiety it's

304
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:33,560
all one big guessing game soup the

305
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,199
conventional doctor doesn't know why you

306
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:38,560
have depression yet offers you an

307
00:14:36,199 --> 00:14:40,000
anti-depressant the alternative doctor

308
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,519
doesn't know why you have depression

309
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,360
either yet offers you a better diet

310
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:46,120
regular exercise routine the

311
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:48,279
recommendation to get rid of processed

312
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:50,600
foods and the instruction to take some

313
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:52,800
vitamin D and

314
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:54,920
multivitamin not every doctor visits

315
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:57,399
going to yield the same recommendations

316
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:58,839
it could vary it could be anything

317
00:14:57,399 --> 00:15:01,759
perhaps your doctor believes you have a

318
00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:04,399
gut problem maybe have sibo or candida

319
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:07,040
leaky gut a microbiome issue maybe

320
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:08,680
that's to blame maybe your conventional

321
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,800
doctor believes you have a chemical

322
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:14,519
imbalance or a neurotransmitter issue

323
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:16,959
dopamine deficiency whatever the case

324
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:19,959
it's still a case of guessing games we

325
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:22,639
don't know why you're sick we don't know

326
00:15:19,959 --> 00:15:24,959
why you have depression or any other

327
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:27,040
chronic symptom but the guessing games

328
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:29,279
don't stop there with alternative

329
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:32,319
medicine conventional medicine

330
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:34,720
they Branch out widespread interest in

331
00:15:32,319 --> 00:15:37,240
psychedelics and micro doing the same

332
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:39,880
guessing game technique leads us there

333
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:42,279
too someone search for anything to try

334
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:45,079
any answers it leads them to the door of

335
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:47,759
the darker side of plant medicine I've

336
00:15:45,079 --> 00:15:51,560
heard this argument a 100 times out

337
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:54,800
there or more psychedelics micro doing

338
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:58,040
is ancient and because it's Ancient

339
00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:00,800
Ancient medicine then it's safe it's

340
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:03,079
been happening for thousands of years

341
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:05,759
this is not to disrespect anyone

342
00:16:03,079 --> 00:16:08,319
involved in iasa ceremonies or any kind

343
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:10,880
of indigenous technique of spiritual

344
00:16:08,319 --> 00:16:13,680
healing indigenous cultures have also

345
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:15,839
grown bananas indigenous cultures have

346
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:18,519
also grown spices such as vanilla bean

347
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:21,199
cinnamon turmeric and ginger these are

348
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:22,839
non-toxic and have healing properties

349
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:26,160
well some of these can be self-limiting

350
00:16:22,839 --> 00:16:29,680
and irritating in large quantities keep

351
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:32,639
that in mind they're not dangerous

352
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:35,759
at the same time though whether we're an

353
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:39,199
indigenous culture or not we can all

354
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:41,920
grow eat and play around with poisons

355
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:43,880
many non-indigenous people become guides

356
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:46,480
or practitioners who administer

357
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:50,079
psychedelics and even toad and frog

358
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:51,680
poison when someone out there Falls ill

359
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:53,880
they have a lot of different symptoms

360
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,880
now they're struggling mentally

361
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:58,600
emotionally they have mental health

362
00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:00,680
issues because of the condition and it's

363
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,560
even part of their symptoms and they're

364
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:05,640
looking for answers to their chronic

365
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:09,160
illness and they're desperate to try

366
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:12,400
anything and then they get further

367
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:14,160
injured in the process Landing a life of

368
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:17,039
much more suffering and hardship than

369
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:20,160
they already had with their condition

370
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:22,280
people in their lives may pass it off as

371
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:26,079
I had a bad trip cuz I did the frog

372
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:28,720
poison and the toad poison or the iasa

373
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:30,960
or I did something else people can pass

374
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:33,760
it off like you just had a bad Trip Man

375
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:36,200
sweep it under the carpet call it a day

376
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,840
it was your journey and that's something

377
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:40,000
that people are told it's like that was

378
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:42,440
your journey that was the

379
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:46,039
process and they'll say It was supposed

380
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:49,080
to happen it was meant to be they had to

381
00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:51,600
learn something from it you grow from it

382
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:53,840
meanwhile it was an injury and not a

383
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:56,679
positive experience of any kind for

384
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:58,919
anyone and maybe no one even realizes

385
00:17:56,679 --> 00:18:01,880
that their brain health is declining

386
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:05,880
from that injury and maybe no one knows

387
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:07,919
it or understands it but either way they

388
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:09,880
could easily have a steady decline in

389
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:11,320
their health because of that trip or

390
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:14,440
that psychedelic

391
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:19,120
experience the term micro doing makes us

392
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:21,400
feel safe ah micro doing to the human

393
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:24,360
psyche micro doing also implies that

394
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:28,080
there's some kind of scientific nature

395
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:29,960
involved we feel secure in the sense

396
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:33,000
that there must be some kind of Science

397
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:34,919
advising it that some type of study has

398
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,799
been done there must have been a whole

399
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:39,400
bunch of studies that proves efficacy

400
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:43,039
but maybe you learned this already in

401
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:46,000
your life or maybe we all know this that

402
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:48,799
scientific studies are just a whole

403
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:52,760
bunch of never-ending games of trial and

404
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:55,200
error theories that become outdated by

405
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:58,640
other theories and more theories than

406
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:02,400
supersede those theories labeling drug

407
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:06,159
use as micro doing provides a sense of

408
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:08,640
safety to a wider variety of people now

409
00:19:06,159 --> 00:19:11,799
it's tempting to many more people who

410
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,760
would have never ever gone there never

411
00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:16,159
would have

412
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:19,440
partaken any way possible unless they

413
00:19:16,159 --> 00:19:22,200
felt that warm fuzzy feeling that

414
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:24,559
science might be behind it and micro

415
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:27,200
doing and psychedelics are no longer for

416
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:29,520
that Niche crowd of people who just go

417
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:32,159
into the desert sit around a campfire

418
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:35,799
and drink a whole bowl of psychedelics

419
00:19:32,159 --> 00:19:39,080
marketing has happened a tactic that

420
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:42,159
pulls in a much bigger crowd and that

421
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:44,280
crowd got bigger and bigger and bigger

422
00:19:42,159 --> 00:19:46,480
because they're looking for Relief so

423
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:49,000
they're doing everything in Edibles and

424
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:52,360
all kinds of micro doing left and right

425
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:55,159
to a point where big Pharma is like no

426
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:57,159
no no no no no we need to bank on this

427
00:19:55,159 --> 00:19:59,760
so big Pharma are going to be taking

428
00:19:57,159 --> 00:20:02,280
over the Psychedelic world soon and big

429
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:06,840
Pharma is going to be in charge of the

430
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:10,120
dosages the micro doing micro doing

431
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:12,840
takes on an air of intelligence

432
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:14,159
something intellectual about it so when

433
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:16,360
you're talking to someone they're like

434
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:18,240
hey micro doing try this you can micro

435
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:20,760
do that here's a psychedelic here's some

436
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,760
toad poison you can micro do this you

437
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:25,080
can do these micro doed Edibles it's

438
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:26,919
like whoa you're smart there's something

439
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:29,840
intelligent about hearing that it's like

440
00:20:26,919 --> 00:20:33,240
wow this is a smart guy or a smart

441
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:34,760
person or this is seems intelligent here

442
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:38,159
there's something behind here it's

443
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:39,840
educated smart and well educated in the

444
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,960
process that they're actually trying to

445
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,520
push on you it's like whoa this sounds

446
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:46,360
like a good thing and that guy's really

447
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:49,240
smart and maybe that person is really

448
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:51,480
smart maybe they are intelligent maybe

449
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:54,400
it's true to some degree that the person

450
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:57,200
offering a micro doing technique knows a

451
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:59,840
lot about the theory yet even if you

452
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:02,720
know a lot about a game it's still a

453
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:06,320
game just being straight out here

454
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:08,120
whether or not anyone wants to hear this

455
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:11,080
there's still going to be a lot of

456
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:13,720
people injured from psychedelics people

457
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:17,159
who went into it into micro doing

458
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:19,320
therapies with a migraine for example or

459
00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:21,400
something else and ended up with worse

460
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:24,120
migraines because of it and you're going

461
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:26,480
to hear more and more of that come out

462
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:28,200
down the road it's going to be a wave of

463
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,840
people and they're going to like oh my

464
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,200
God I've been injured by this you're

465
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,440
going to hear it out there it takes a

466
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:36,360
little time because right now it's

467
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:38,960
uncool to complain when you're doing the

468
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:41,360
micro doing you just better be quiet and

469
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,679
deal with it deal with the journey deal

470
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:46,159
with what it is any bad experience was

471
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,640
just spiritual and move on but there's

472
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:50,640
going to be a lot of people that are

473
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:52,240
going to be like no I have to speak out

474
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:55,600
it's going to shift and you're going to

475
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:58,720
see it out there what psychedelics do is

476
00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:00,200
put the body in a crisis state

477
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,760
so when you're taking some of these

478
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:06,000
psychedelics the body goes instantly

479
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:08,760
into a crisis State when we go through a

480
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:12,320
crisis State and come out of it we

481
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:14,960
change in some way as a person it's like

482
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:17,679
surviving a 10ar pile up on the freeway

483
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,760
your car flips over two or three times

484
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:22,159
you're tossed about and you seem to get

485
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:24,400
out of the car walk out of it alive with

486
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:27,480
a mild concussion while others around

487
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:31,080
you died there's something that happens

488
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:33,600
inside of us when we survive any kind of

489
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:36,159
Crisis whatsoever and that falls into

490
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:39,480
spiritual change and when we induce

491
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:43,080
ourselves with a toxic chemical compound

492
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:47,400
that throws our body into chaos after it

493
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:51,360
subsides we feel we spiritually grew the

494
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:54,200
addiction process this is a big one the

495
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,760
addiction process that occurs with any

496
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:58,880
dose of

497
00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:03,200
psychedelics the addiction to

498
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:06,159
how did we survive that what a heck of a

499
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:09,440
ride my spiritual teacher told me how

500
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:12,480
much I've grown by doing it I think I'm

501
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:15,039
ready to do it again one of the

502
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:18,400
addictive aspects of psychedelics is the

503
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:21,799
adrenaline surge the roller coaster ride

504
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:24,799
it's when any poison or toxin hits the

505
00:23:21,799 --> 00:23:28,240
bloodstream the adrenaline

506
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:30,880
explodes poisons enter our bloodstream

507
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:34,600
and that adrenaline surge happens the

508
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:37,559
roller coaster ride that poison is

509
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:41,720
foreign the psychedelics the frog toad

510
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:45,400
poison the psilocybin iasa it's all

511
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:47,279
foreign to the body your body has to

512
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:51,760
protect the brain so your adrenals

513
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:54,520
release a blow a spill a massive spill

514
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:58,120
of adrenaline it becomes a steroid

515
00:23:54,520 --> 00:24:00,600
compound instantly steroids are there to

516
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:03,799
try to stop a crisis it's your natural

517
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:07,520
steroid maker your adrenals release that

518
00:24:03,799 --> 00:24:09,960
steroid your adrenaline to stop the blow

519
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:13,240
from being hard to the brain heart and

520
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:15,679
lungs so it doesn't take a hit so hard a

521
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:18,799
micro do of psychedelics triggers off a

522
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:22,279
brain alarm because the brain starts to

523
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:25,600
get poisoned the brain then sends an

524
00:24:22,279 --> 00:24:27,799
emergency signal to the brain stem and

525
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:30,159
then out to your adrenals looking for

526
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:33,399
for the adrenals to save your

527
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:35,200
brain and that intense adrenaline blend

528
00:24:33,399 --> 00:24:37,799
that's pouring out spilling out of your

529
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:40,559
adrenals is released to stop Strokes

530
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:43,320
from occurring and blood clots from

531
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:47,240
forming that adrenaline is there to thin

532
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:49,520
out the blood and open up blood vessels

533
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:51,880
because guess what the blood vessels are

534
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:53,760
starting to close so the steroid

535
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:56,320
compounds in the adrenaline are there to

536
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:59,480
keep the blood vessels open so they're

537
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,960
not getting shut down swell and close

538
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:04,799
down from the

539
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:07,919

00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:46,520
poison psychedelics enters into our

553
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:49,679
bloodstream our immune system sees it as

554
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:52,440
an Invader as a psychedelic poison

555
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:55,360
enters our bloodstream our immune cells

556
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:59,679
try to devour it and when our immune

557
00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:02,760
systems try to devour it it bulks up our

558
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:05,640
immune cells climb on top of each other

559
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:08,840
it becomes a ball like a big snowball

560
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:11,200
rolling down a hill a mountain more and

561
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:13,760
more immune cells keep on coming to Aid

562
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,159
the other immune cells and they all try

563
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:19,440
to Devour the

564
00:26:15,159 --> 00:26:21,679
poison this leads to a small blood clot

565
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:24,159
developing our immune system has an

566
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:26,960
intelligence built into it our immune

567
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:28,360
cells know that a small blood clot is

568
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:31,159
developing

569
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:34,720
our immune cells also know something's

570
00:26:31,159 --> 00:26:36,760
coming to rescue it a corrosive

571
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:40,559
substance something that's coming from

572
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:44,600
our adrenal glands something that can

573
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:47,799
dissolve the blood clot something that's

574
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:51,000
strong now adrenaline isn't as strong as

575
00:26:47,799 --> 00:26:54,039
kerosene it's not like paint thinner but

576
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:57,399
it's strong in its own way it's there to

577
00:26:54,039 --> 00:26:59,799
thin out the blood it's there to destroy

578
00:26:57,399 --> 00:27:02,480
the the blood clot that the immune cells

579
00:26:59,799 --> 00:27:04,720
were building by devouring the poison

580
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:07,520
it's there to separate that blood clot

581
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:10,720
to send the immune cells on their way

582
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:14,760
with the poison inside of them this

583
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:18,440
lowers the blow to the brain this

584
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:20,520
process lowers the blow that the toxins

585
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:24,279
from the Frog poison toad poison or

586
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:27,080
psychedelics or iasa psilocybin or

587
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:29,640
whatever it lowers the blow to the brain

588
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:32,799
stem in the brain and then that

589
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:36,240
adrenaline opens up the passageways like

590
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:38,720
a steroid so there's less constriction

591
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:41,399
in blood vessels in the brain and other

592
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:44,039
places in the body so that poisons that

593
00:27:41,399 --> 00:27:46,799
the person ingested can leave the brain

594
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:47,960
and body easier this whole process

595
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:50,679
becomes

596
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:53,519
chaos this chaos is part of the

597
00:27:50,679 --> 00:27:55,720
addiction process of psychedelics the

598
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:57,519
adrenaline that's released to thin out

599
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:59,960
the blood so that the person does

600
00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:02,120
doesn't stroke out also goes into the

601
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:05,240
brain and gives the person the ultimate

602
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:07,720
high at the very same time the chemical

603
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:09,679
compounds the toxins in the psychedelics

604
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:12,480
are saturating neurons causing

605
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:15,960
hallucinogenic effects it's this

606
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:18,799
combination of that big adrenaline high

607
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:22,159
from that big adrenaline burst to save

608
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:26,399
the person to keep them safe as much as

609
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:28,000
possible combined with the toxin itself

610
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:31,640
from the psychedelics

611
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:34,840
gives the person the addiction and then

612
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:38,320
there's the aftermath what goes up must

613
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:41,559
come down the aftermath is the coming

614
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:43,919
down part the adrenaline high now

615
00:28:41,559 --> 00:28:46,480
leaving your body and becoming an

616
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:49,080
adrenaline low our body is in the

617
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:51,720
process of recovery now as the poisonous

618
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:52,600
chemical compounds from the psychedelics

619
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:56,399
are

620
00:28:52,600 --> 00:29:00,519
dissipating and we survived it we

621
00:28:56,399 --> 00:29:03,320
survived a another night or another day

622
00:29:00,519 --> 00:29:05,440
it's not exactly the same as being in a

623
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:07,760
party where you got totally completely

624
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:09,799
drunk and stoned and puked in the

625
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:12,720
bathroom all night long and then spent

626
00:29:09,799 --> 00:29:14,760
the next day in a stoer and a hangover

627
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,399
yet there are

628
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:20,000
similarities

629
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:23,519
regardless whichever toxin or compound

630
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:26,200
or substance you sent through your body

631
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:28,480
you went into survival mode they're

632
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:30,840
parties you'll never forget get

633
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:32,640
experiences that become etched in your

634
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:35,480
Consciousness the parties we never

635
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:37,720
forget aren't cures for depression the

636
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:39,320
parties that we go and do aren't the

637
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:41,840
parties that actually get rid of our

638
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:44,080
anxiety in the end the parties we never

639
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:47,559
forget don't get rid of our brain fog or

640
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:51,000
fatigue or neurological symptoms the

641
00:29:47,559 --> 00:29:53,880
parties we never forget only worsen them

642
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:56,080
one of the saddest parts of psychedelics

643
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:59,720
is knowing that somebody out there

644
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:02,640
25-year-old or 28-year-old or anyone who

645
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:04,880
doesn't have any idea why they're sick

646
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,840
they've seen a number of doctors tried a

647
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,120
number of

648
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:10,880
medications they can't find relief

649
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:14,320
mentally or physically and then they

650
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:16,720
stumble into the world of this can heal

651
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:19,799
you physically and spiritually just try

652
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:22,360
this micro doing it's one thing if

653
00:30:19,799 --> 00:30:25,120
you're not healing so you take some

654
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:27,880
junky vitamins or try a range of animal

655
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:29,640
protein and plant-based diets try a few

656
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:31,640
different therapies and healing

657
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:34,000
techniques try conventional

658
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:36,320
Pharmaceuticals and you're still stuck

659
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,600
and you're still sick that's a better

660
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:41,399
place to be than getting caught up in

661
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:44,559
the world of psychedelics believing that

662
00:30:41,399 --> 00:30:47,480
maybe you have a spiritual block that's

663
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:50,200
keeping you physically ill when we lose

664
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:52,600
time and we're really exhausted and we

665
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:56,159
don't have answers that are working or

666
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:59,960
helping the next easy cell is it has to

667
00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:03,440
be you you're the problem this is a

668
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:06,279
spiritual issue a mental and emotional

669
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:08,880
problem the psychedelics will shift

670
00:31:06,279 --> 00:31:11,600
something within you you'll be told

671
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:13,880
bring you to more spiritual growth take

672
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:16,559
you on a spiritual journey or problems

673
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:18,559
can be solved so the outcomes in how you

674
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:21,480
feel physically and emotionally can

675
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:23,240
improve and be healed or you'll start

676
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:25,480
hearing that the psychedelics will

677
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:28,399
change your brain chemistry on a

illness and there's some type of

681
