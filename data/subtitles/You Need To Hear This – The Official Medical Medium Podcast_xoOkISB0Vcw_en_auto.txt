[132.48 - 135.04] of gmo
[133.68 - 136.80] they think we're losing it all because
[135.04 - 137.52] of other reasons actually we're losing

[218.08 - 223.84] um so um but yeah apple podcast is where
[222.24 - 226.32] it's guaranteed to be
[223.84 - 227.36] any other platform it might be uploaded
[226.32 - 228.48] fragmented
[227.36 - 230.80] you might not have heard the whole
[228.48 - 232.48] episode but don't know it so keep that
[230.80 - 233.28] in mind if you're used to listening to
[232.48 - 236.56] it on a
[233.28 - 237.04] another platform because it might be
[236.56 - 239.36] worth
[237.04 - 240.96] going to where it's really guaranteed to
[239.36 - 243.92] be apple podcast
[240.96 - 245.92] and so um so i want to talk a little bit
[243.92 - 246.88] about this if you've heard this episode
[245.92 - 249.04] already
[246.88 - 250.56] so if you heard the episode already let
[249.04 - 252.56] me know what you think about it
[250.56 - 254.08] um just you know out you can ask me any
[252.56 - 254.72] questions about it the whole bit go
[254.08 - 257.68] ahead
[254.72 - 260.00] it's perfectly fine and i mean there's
[257.68 - 260.64] even powerful hidden messages spiritual
[260.00 - 263.60] messages
[260.64 - 264.88] inside these episodes on top of it so
[263.60 - 267.52] you can look out for that
[264.88 - 268.32] just know that when you listen to this
[267.52 - 271.44] episode
[268.32 - 273.52] it's packed with details and information
[271.44 - 275.92] you might have to listen to it twice
[273.52 - 277.68] or even more than twice in order to
[275.92 - 281.20] actually glean and gather
[277.68 - 283.04] all that information there's so much and
[281.20 - 284.24] love you guys too patty says love you
[283.04 - 287.60] anthony love you too
[284.24 - 289.60] um mm podcasts uh
[287.60 - 291.28] have been out there no that the mm
[289.60 - 292.40] podcast in the past that was an old
[291.28 - 294.48] radio show
[292.40 - 295.44] so that wasn't the mm official medical
[294.48 - 297.76] meeting podcast
[295.44 - 300.24] big difference i'm just letting you know
[297.76 - 302.88] this is an entirely different situation
[300.24 - 304.96] if you're used to my old radio shows
[302.88 - 306.72] those were censored because pretty much
[304.96 - 308.96] it wasn't my podcast a whole bit
[306.72 - 310.32] this is the medical medium official
[308.96 - 313.44] podcast
[310.32 - 315.52] just tried and true this is it um and
[313.44 - 317.76] and it's it's exciting the first episode
[315.52 - 321.04] is chemtrails the sky is falling
[317.76 - 321.36] um if you're somebody in in your and you
[321.04 - 322.72] like
[321.36 - 324.48] being in the world you're in now you
[322.72 - 326.40] don't want to know about certain things
[324.48 - 329.12] i would sit that episode out because
[326.40 - 332.40] that episode chemtrails is just
[329.12 - 333.76] it's it's scary it's in it's a scary
[332.40 - 335.44] episode so i'm just
[333.76 - 337.52] giving you kind of the forewarning a
[335.44 - 339.36] little kind of forewarning there
[337.52 - 341.36] um but if you think you can handle it
[339.36 - 344.00] and handle the truth or handle
[341.36 - 345.12] the truth but more than that the
[344.00 - 347.52] information
[345.12 - 349.12] at you know at its entirety there then
[347.52 - 350.48] if you feel like you can handle such a
[349.12 - 352.72] shocker then
[350.48 - 354.00] a good apple podcast and listen to
[352.72 - 357.52] medical medium

[461.84 - 465.12] they're on a level all on their own too
[464.40 - 467.04] so
[465.12 - 469.12] medical medium information has always
[467.04 - 471.20] been about advanced unique original
[469.12 - 471.76] information it's not like other podcasts
[471.20 - 473.92] okay
[471.76 - 476.24] other podcasts they're regurgitating the
[473.92 - 478.64] same old stuff they're regurgitating
[476.24 - 480.08] misinformation about health and just
[478.64 - 481.60] swimming it around swimming
[480.08 - 483.20] around they have guests come on and it's
[481.60 - 485.12] all the same stuff unless
[483.20 - 486.64] they took pieces from medical medium
[485.12 - 488.56] information for the 35
[486.64 - 490.80] years of putting out unique information
[488.56 - 492.00] and then it gets taken not cited back
[490.80 - 494.48] and then it becomes out
[492.00 - 496.16] there like that but this is different
[494.48 - 498.00] medical medium information has always
[496.16 - 501.12] been about ahead of its time
[498.00 - 501.92] by decades and even more and what you'll
[501.12 - 505.04] find
[501.92 - 507.28] in this podcast is that plus even
[505.04 - 508.96] more it's going to be to a whole another
[507.28 - 509.76] level it's going to be unbelievable on
[508.96 - 512.40] that level
[509.76 - 513.60] so this episode chemtrails this guy is
[512.40 - 516.56] falling
[513.60 - 518.96] really really powerful and it's the
[516.56 - 522.00] detailed truth in history
[518.96 - 522.96] about chemtrails not speculation not
[522.00 - 526.56] theories

[526.56 - 529.92] real mind-blowing deal okay you're going
[529.12 - 532.16] to learn why

[532.16 - 534.96] planet how they've been dying for
[533.76 - 537.36] decades however

[545.68 - 548.88] is gone
[546.64 - 549.68] and they don't let anybody know it's
[548.88 - 551.84] kind of like

[551.84 - 555.68] you don't know
[552.80 - 557.92] that it's a fraction of what it was 50
[555.68 - 559.68] years ago a fraction of what it was 40
[557.92 - 560.64] years ago people have no idea and where

[849.36 - 853.52] to this podcast cite it back to the
[851.84 - 856.16] chemtrail episode
[853.52 - 857.84] so people know where that information
[856.16 - 859.04] comes from because if you know something
[857.84 - 861.20] about chemtrails
[859.04 - 862.48] you'll find out that you don't know
[861.20 - 863.92] about chemtrails
[862.48 - 866.16] you know yeah you'll know something
[863.92 - 868.16] about them from the misinformation
[866.16 - 870.00] and the theories out there but when you
[868.16 - 872.40] actually hear the truth of what really
[870.00 - 875.04] happened why these chemtrails are here
[872.40 - 877.12] what's going on and you learn that
[875.04 - 878.80] it's a whole different ballpark and that
[877.12 - 880.32] information will then get saturated out
[878.80 - 881.60] there it won't get cited back to me
[880.32 - 884.08] probably eventually
[881.60 - 885.92] and then it'll be like oh oh the that's
[884.08 - 888.64] where it comes from out there somewhere
[885.92 - 890.16] no you'll it originates here like 35
[888.64 - 891.36] years of medical mean information that
[890.16 - 893.20] has escaped through
[891.36 - 894.40] toxic heavy metals talk about that
[893.20 - 895.44] originates from medical medium
[894.40 - 897.36] information
[895.44 - 899.44] lemon water cleansing the body and the
[897.36 - 901.28] liver cleansing the liver
[899.44 - 903.60] lemon water that's medical medium
[901.28 - 905.92] information started 35 years ago
[903.60 - 907.52] and there's a celery juice same thing
[905.92 - 909.60] but it's like what it is is
[907.52 - 910.72] what you'll find in this podcast along
[909.60 - 914.32] with other stuff
[910.72 - 916.88] in in you'll find information
[914.32 - 918.24] decades ahead of what's out there now
[916.88 - 921.28] and the whole bit so
[918.24 - 925.12] um charlotte says love the ending you

[1034.56 - 1040.80] keep destroying ourselves the human race
[1037.84 - 1042.56] because it's good versus evil and i talk
[1040.80 - 1043.60] about that in this podcast and i talk
[1042.56 - 1045.44] about that in the other
[1043.60 - 1046.80] episodes too in some different ways
[1045.44 - 1049.84] because
[1046.80 - 1051.60] yeah darkness does want to destroy
[1049.84 - 1053.36] people so it's a very horrible thing
[1051.60 - 1055.12] it's evil tricking the good
[1053.36 - 1056.72] and that's been around for centuries and
[1055.12 - 1058.32] centuries and centuries it's been around
[1056.72 - 1060.40] since the beginning of the human race
[1058.32 - 1061.76] but um but either way it doesn't matter
[1060.40 - 1063.44] you'll protect yourself from the whole
[1061.76 - 1065.52] bit and we can rise out of the ashes
[1063.44 - 1068.40] together and we can heal together

[1497.84 - 1501.60] thought i knew about chemtrails
[1499.52 - 1504.08] but this filled in the gaps and all of
[1501.60 - 1507.44] the details made it to the next level
[1504.08 - 1508.56] each other you know it's it's um exactly
[1507.44 - 1510.64] because
[1508.56 - 1511.84] there just isn't really enough
[1510.64 - 1514.00] information or
[1511.84 - 1515.60] barely any information on any level out
[1514.00 - 1518.24] there in chemtrails and this

[1518.24 - 1523.36] this is the package of information that
[1520.48 - 1524.40] really is going to set the stage to so
[1523.36 - 1526.72] people can
