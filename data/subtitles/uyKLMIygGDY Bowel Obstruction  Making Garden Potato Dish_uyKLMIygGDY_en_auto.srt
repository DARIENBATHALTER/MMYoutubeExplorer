they're vomiting they're having problems

23
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,280
and then they're being told you got a

24
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:53,440
bowel obstruction get ready for surgery

25
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,879
they stick a pipe down your throat then

26
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,719
you got a pipe in your stomach and

27
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:58,800
they're sucking air out is what they're

28
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,359
doing so you sit in the hospital bed for

29
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,960
a day you sit in a hospital bed for two

30
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,559
days while you got a pipe down your

31
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,280
throat sitting in your stomach and the

32
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,799
pipe is sucking up air

33
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,600
and you're being told we're gonna run

34
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:13,360
another mri cat scan we're going to run

35
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,280
another test right here and we're going

36
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,799
to see how that obstruction is doing and

37
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,799
you're like oh my god they say your

38
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,280
obstruction is still there so we have to

39
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,600
do emergency surgery and you go and you

40
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,280
get a big part of the colon cut out and

41
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,200
you get that cut out and everything and

42
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,960
then they put you back together and they

43
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,799
sew you up they you're in the hospital

44
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,400
bed and like okay your bowel

45
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,479
obstruction's better now and what's

46
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,640
happening is it's not about obstruction

47
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:38,159
maybe some people

48
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,119
are getting bowel obstructions out there

49
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:43,600
because they do but there's this wave a

50
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:45,200
wave of chronic bowel obstructions

51
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,960
hospitals are getting filled with people

52
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,360
running in getting bowel obstructions

53
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,280

00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,200

we're gonna throw that in the pan too

86
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,480
onions like i said they came out of the

87
00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:00,640
garden i cured them right so they're not

88
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,480
that they're not fresh out of the garden

89
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,400
they're actually cured they've been

90
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,760
sitting around for a while right you got

91
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,800
to watch out they don't mold up you got

92
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:11,120
to know how to cure them okay cilantro

93
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,720
out of the garden too how exciting is

94
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,800
that right

95
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,840
and then the potatoes i showed you and

96
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,840
i'm going to show you again we're going

97
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,239
to do a little rinse and wash good to

98
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,760
see you guys coming on here and

99
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,840
peppers

100
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:27,280
hot peppers out of the garden now these

101
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,879
are green right so i picked these early

102
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,959
so i usually like to leave them red

103
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:33,120
because green peppers are not ripe and

104
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,599
that's what gives people trouble unripe

105
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,519
peppers right unripe ones and i talk

106
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,319
about that all the time

107
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,000
but

108
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:41,519
these are

109
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,040
that see how it's almost turning red and

110
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,959
i'll show you some close-ups in a little

111
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,799
bit too i'll tell you why i picked them

112
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,959
green to begin with which is pretty

113
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:51,440
funny because i don't usually do that i

114
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:54,000
picked them green for a reason

115
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,680
because i had a bunny rabbit that was

116
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
going after all the peppers and i was

117
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,159
like how's that how's that possible

118
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,760
because those are hot but you know

119
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,640
squirrels and bunny rabbits were really

120
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,480
hungry

121
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,560
so we're live right now you guys we're

122
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,680
live and i'm excited so let me just cook

123
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,159
a little bit we're going to talk about

124
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,519
bowel obstructions as well

125
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,840
and we're going to do a little demo

126
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,040
about that talk about the gut a little

127
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,479
bit too

128
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,919
so let's get going let's get some onions

129
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:21,759
right here so i'm going to cut some

130
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:23,199
onions right now

131
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,400
i love when onions come out of the

132
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,400
garden it's really

133
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,240
exciting everything that comes out of

134
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,520
the garden always seems like it tastes

135
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,040
the best right

136
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,320
so that's that's what it always seems

137
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,080
like i'm going to put the garbage can

138
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,320
right here too so i can drop some in

139
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,320
there

140
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,560
and i like to save all that too and

141
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:48,080
throw it in a pile and

142
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,680
make some future dirt right

143
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,280
so what i'm doing is i'm just getting a

144
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,479
couple of onions

145
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,520
ready here

146
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:57,919
good to see you guys coming on

147
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:00,320
so we're live right now

148
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:02,240
i'm excited making a garden

149
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,520
vegetable potato dish

150
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,160
why not

151
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:09,600
kind of excited about that right i got

152
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,360
the pan on right there it's getting hot

153
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,280
peeling back some onions and we're going

154
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,000
to talk about bowel obstructions at the

155
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:18,400
same time a lot of people have

156
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,360
chronic bowel obstructions because they

157
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:23,520
have crohn's colitis they have difficult

158
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,120
with their intestinal tract because

159
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,479
difficulties with their intestinal tract

160
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,080
because

161
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,759
they're inflamed so inside their

162
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,960
intestinal tract they're inflamed so as

163
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,720
the food is moving through their

164
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,520
intestinal tract they're having many

165
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,199
obstructions all the time

166
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,639
there's a lot of people that have to

167
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,680
live with that and they have to go

168
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,800
through that

169
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:45,680
okay and then there's that random acute

170
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,199
bowel obstruction right it's acute it's

171
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,160
random

172
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,800
okay

173
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,160
and we have those two out there people

174
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,759
do get about obstruction i'm going to

175
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,080
talk about a couple of stories about

176
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:58,000
that how serious this could be and then

177
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,240
there's this mystery about obstruction

178
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,520
that's not about obstruction that's

179
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:05,360
happening after someone gets a bug so

180
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,440
they're getting a bug that bug either

181
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,000
gets diagnosed as the flu it gets

182
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,600
diagnosed as the c word it gets

183
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,560
diagnosed as

184
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:18,240
something like that or a stomach bug or

185
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:20,560
diagnosed as food poisoning

186
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,479
right and then everything's fine it goes

237
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:15,360
okay melissa do potatoes become toxic

238
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:18,319
when they start to turn green

239
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,479
yeah don't eat them when they're green

240
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,479
that's not a good idea don't eat them

241
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:24,720
when they're green if it's all you got

242
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:27,039
it's the only food you have you can peel

243
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,440
back some of the green or all the green

244
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:31,440
you see right but i don't eat cream

245
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,680
potatoes

246
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:36,719
so a lot of fruits and vegetables that

247
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:40,000
if you know that that become toxic

248
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:41,680
for a lot of different reasons

249
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,959
just like when you have meat meat

250
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:46,399
becomes toxic when it's when it's brown

251
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,720
you know when meat turns brown you know

252
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:51,920
what they do they coat the meat

253
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:54,720
they coat beef with a chemical right a

254
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:58,080
sulfur chemical and that sulfur chemical

255
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,839
keeps it from turning brown in the store

256
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,120
that's just really that's that's that's

257
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:04,720
not good

258
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,720
that's not good let's get some uh

259
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,560
everything has the potential of having a

260
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,560
problem right

261
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,240
so you got to know

262
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,240
know what to do when to do whatever

263
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,480
thrown some onions in the pan let's get

264
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,800
this cooking

265
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:25,600
jennifer says when in doubt throw it out

266
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,279
on facebook right there

267
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,360
guys we're live right now

268
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:32,480
i'm gonna put another onion in here

269
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,480
one more let's do that

270
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,519
let's get another onion going

271
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,279
guys we're talking about bowel

272
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,600
obstructions i want to do a little demo

273
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,959
real quick too

274
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,200
about it

275
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,200
right

276
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:50,640
so the emergency rooms

277
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:52,720
for the last six to eight weeks

278
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:57,680
have been filling up with a lot of these

279
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:57,680
mysterious bowel obstruction cases

280
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,160
it's usually a couple of weeks after

281
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,560
they were sick

282
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,320
with a cold a flu

283
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,600
or the seed

284
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,920
right

285
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,920
and then they get better they're moving

286
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:14,160
forward and all of a sudden they get

287
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:17,680
this bowel obstruction because

288
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,959
that bug they had

289
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,959
created

290
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,959
inflammation

291
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,360
in the colon

292
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:32,480
not allowing food to get through so easy

293
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:35,680
but yet it's not a bowel obstruction

294
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:37,040
it's just an inflamed area

295
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,360
and then what they do is they stick a

296
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,360
pipe

297
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,920
down your throat

298
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:48,320
another thing this bug is doing is

299
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,320
creating a neurological spasm

300
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,760
a vagus nerve spasm

301
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:55,920
in the intestinal tract locking it up

302
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,760
causing paralysis of the intestinal

303
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,440
tract so it's not really technically

304
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,160
about obstruction there's a temporary

305
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:04,640
paralysis and inflammation

306
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,880
that's happening

307
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:09,279
and then what the sad part is if they

308
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:11,519
don't have a good doctor if they don't

309
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:13,200
have a good health practitioner that's

310
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,720
looking out for them they'll go and get

311
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,399
the surgery

312
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,399
they'll get thrown into the surgery so

313
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,399
there's thousands of people across this

314
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,600
country right now and also other places

315
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:24,399
around the world

316
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,320
that are getting bowel surgery and

317
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:29,600
getting a piece of their colon removed

318
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:31,360
for no reason because they don't know it

319
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,279
at the emergency room and at the

320
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,560
hospitals they don't know that this is a

321
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:37,440
bug going around

322
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,720
causing temporary paralysis of

323
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,480
the colon

324
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,760
and it's been being misdiagnosed as

325
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,519
about structure now don't get this

326
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,040
confused with real bowel obstructions

327
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:47,600
people can have a real bowel obstruction

328
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:50,079

00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:49,440
out of here if you're not going to cook

432
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:51,199
it that long and thoroughly right you

433
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,480
want to take those out because they're

434
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:54,880

435
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,480
and you've got teeth problems or

436
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,000

437
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,600
somebody or a friend that comes over and

438
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,600
they just had dental work done and they

439
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,440

440
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,519

441
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,440
you never know right

442
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,839
so i'm gonna cut this patty pan in half

443
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,839
like that

444
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,480
right

445
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,880
this is great

446
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,959
i'm going to put the lid on that too in

447
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:23,839
a moment we're going to let that cook

448
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:27,360
down look at that

449
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:30,160
i only put one potato in there

450
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,920
but it was one big potato so

451
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,920
i mean you can do three potatoes in

452
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,600
there you can do four you can do as many

453
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,680
potatoes as you want in your dish you

454
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:40,880
can make it the way you want it right

455
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:43,279
this is kind of a medley of stuff

456
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,279
all right

457
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,880

461
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,720
and cook let's get down to it we're

491
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,799

00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,240
cramping in the gut and they don't

517
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,720
understand what it is is this

518
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,880
appendicitis what is this and they go to

519
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:52,160
the emergency room

520
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:54,160
right they get to the emergency room

521
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,160
and then the doctor says we think it's

522
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:58,240
an obstruction we're going to do a test

523
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,480
and they get a test they get the cat

00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,240
scan they get or an mri usually it's a

525
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,000
cat scan with this and that's one of the

526
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,919
tests they do well your cat scan shows

527
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,080
that you have an obstruction well i

528
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:09,840

529
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,520
problem i didn't eat anything crazy

530
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:13,039
what's going on here where you got an

531
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,880
obstruction is what they say and this is

532
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:16,960
what's happening all in these hospitals

533
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,400
all in this country and around the world

534
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,080
are saying this doctor's like you got

535
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,640
ma'am you got an obstruction and in the

536
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:24,320
next room you sir you got an obstruction

537
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,679
i actually talked to somebody recently

538
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,679
an emergency room doctor who's a friend

539
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:29,039
of mine that said literally three rooms

540
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,799
like one room over here that's an

541
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:33,039
obstruction another person was diagnosed

542
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:34,400
with obstruction three rooms down and

543
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,840
then one room and then they you know

544
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,200
another room and then they rush them up

545
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,960
and there and they get them ready so

546
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,240
what they do is

547
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,919
they they get told they got this

548
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,200
obstruction they get a pipe down their

549
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:45,679
throat right

550
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:48,000
and the pipe is to suck air out or any

551
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:49,760
contents in the stomach so that's what

552
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,919
they're doing so they put the pipe down

553
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:55,039
the pipe goes down into the stomach and

554
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:56,960
then the pipe is sitting there vacuuming

555
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:58,240
it's vacuuming so now you're in bed and

556
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,400
you're stuck and you're like what is

557
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,159
this i never had this problem before i'm

558
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,440
told i have an obstruction and thinking

559
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,840
you got a pipe and it's down it's

560
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,679
sitting inside your stomach right here

561
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:10,400
and it's dry it's sucking air and it's

562
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:12,159
sucking air and that's what's happening

563
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,559
stellini says are these vegetables from

564
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:16,640
your garden yes they are they actually

565
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:18,159
are from my garden which is such a

566
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,960
blessing truly

567
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:20,640
um

568
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,159
all right so let's go into this the pipe

569
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,679
sits in the stomach and you sit there

570
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:25,360
for a day or two while they run you

571
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,280
through tests and what they tell you is

572
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:29,840
you're gonna need surgery because we see

573
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,919
the obstruction it's on the test it's on

574
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:34,960
the scan but what they're seeing is a

575
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:37,520
lock up yeah it's not an obstruction but

576
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:40,559
they're seeing fecal matter in an area

577
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:42,640
that had that has temporary paralysis

578
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:44,880
that's what they're seeing all right

579
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:47,120
from for all these random cases all

580
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:49,679
these random mystery cases it's not

581
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:51,120
somebody who's who's known to have

582
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,640
obstructions throughout their life

583
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,240
they've had multiple surgeries they've

584
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,480
got a tremendous amount of scar tissue

585
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,240
when they get obstructions periodically

586
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,240
you know that's different or someone who

587
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,640
gets a kink someone who actually gets a

588
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,799
kink in the intestinal tract where they

589
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,919
actually get a kink and when that kink

590
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:07,280
happens

591
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,520
then they're in trouble and they have to

592
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,880
get surgery if it can't work itself out

593
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,559
they need to get surgery now that's

594
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,840
different now that happens out there i

595
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:17,360
see a lot of people get kinks in their

596
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:19,039
colon they get kinks in their small

597
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,159
intestinal tract

598
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:22,320
and

599
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:24,080
that's what goes on right but this is

600
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,280
different this is temporary paralysis of

601
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,120
a certain area of the colon or

602
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:29,919
intestinal tract because the nerves

603
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:31,600
going to that stop working because the

604
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:32,960
bug that's going around in the last

605
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:36,320
couple of months

606
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:38,720
is seizing up the nerve

607
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:41,200
in that area

608
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:43,120
and then inflammation also occurs in

609
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:46,080
that area too the bug can do two things

610
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:47,840
it attacks the nerves in that area or

611
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,919
inflames that area of the intestinal

612
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,600
tract and then that swelling happens

613
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:53,919
just enough swelling along with

614
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,280
paralysis that food's not moving through

615
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:57,840
too easy

616
00:21:55,280 --> 00:22:00,559
but the symptom isn't just because of

617
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:02,880
that the symptom is it's it's a delayed

618
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:05,679
reaction this bug has

619
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,039
elizabeth says it was all viral yeah

620
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:08,640
it is it's happening out there all the

621
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:09,840
time so really they're having a viral

622
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,360
infection

623
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,480
viral infection causing temporary

624
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,559
paralysis

625
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,400
of the intestinal tract or

626
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:17,919
colon okay

627
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,159
and then they're getting diagnosed

628
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:21,520
misdiagnosed with bowel obstruction and

629
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:23,200
they're getting their colons removed now

630
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,960
here's the thing after somebody that had

631
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,520
a c-section so say you're a woman you

632
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,600
had your you had a c-section

633
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,520
and you know that's that's

634
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,840
that you know during your pregnancy you

635
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:36,240
have the c-section if that happened

636
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:39,520
they'll blame the scar tissue from your

637
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,720
c-section as this bowel obstruction say

638
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:43,280
you're somebody that had a hernia

639
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:45,280
surgery so if anybody had any kind of

640
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,640
hernia surgery regardless of the hernia

641
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,640
surgery wherever it is if it was a

642
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,480
hernia to the left it was a herniated to

643
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:53,360
the right if it was a hernia in the

644
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:55,520
middle wherever the hernia was

645
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:58,640
if they did a previous hernia surgery

646
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,679
they'll then tell the the

647
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,240
patient

648
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:05,520
that the scar tissue from the hernia

649
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:07,520
surgery they had 20 years ago over here

650
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,760
is why they have a bowel obstruction

651
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,280
over here that's what they're told

652
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,919
they're told the bowel obstruction is

653
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:15,679
because of scar tissue from a hernia

654
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,520
surgery that's somewhere else now i'm

655
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:19,840
seeing this out there

656
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,919
happening where people had okay yeah i

657
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,200
had a hernia 30 years ago they'll say to

658
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:24,880
the doctor and they'll say well that

659
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,640
hernia scar tissue down here is the

660
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,159
reason why you have bowel obstruction

661
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,720
over here so we're going to need surgery

662
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:32,640
now and get that bowel obstruction fixed

663
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:35,360
so that's what's going on right now i'm

664
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:37,840
just going to move

665
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:40,960
this guy over a little bit and just make

666
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,960
sure this is cooking up

667
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:47,520
so i put the lid on the pan

668
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:49,120
it gets the moisture from the squash is

669
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,679
actually

670
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:53,679
moving helping everything stay moist so

671
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:55,440
nothing's burning in the pan the onion

672
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,640
the moisture from the onion is actually

673
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,559
helping too

674
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,400
and then i have that potato that garden

675
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:01,840
potato with this garden squash garden

676
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,240
onions i have it all

677
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:06,240
in the process of kind of steaming up

678
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:10,320
and cooking i have this little portable

679
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,320
burner i got it on maximum right now

680
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:18,400
now there are people that actually have

681
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:20,159
crohn's colitis they have

682
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:23,039
large amounts of inflammation inside the

683
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:25,200
intestinal tract and inside the colon

684
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:27,679
and so they have a narrowing

685
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,279
and if they eat something problematic

686
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:30,640
you can have a problem i remember a long

687
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:34,000
time ago

688
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:36,880
a doctor sent a patient to me

689
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,640
that had that type of inflammation that

690
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,600
type of swelling inside the intestinal

691
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,039
tract

692
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,840
and the patient

693
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:47,039
already had a surgery

694
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:48,720
the surgery happened because

695
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:51,039
they had

696
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,360
a cheeseburger at a cookout

697
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:54,960
really tough meat in the cheeseburger

698
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:57,679
that's what they said it was a big large

699
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:59,840
cheeseburger at a cookout this is an

700
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:01,039
anti-animal protein anti-vegan that's

701
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:04,880
not what this is about i'm just giving

702
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:06,000
you guys this person's experience right

703
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,600
and

704
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,240
she said that

705
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:12,640
she had the burger and then that night

706
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:17,039
she had the vomiting she had

707
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:19,679
the pain and she had a real obstruction

708
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:22,480
that meat was stuck so it was stuck the

709
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:26,159
gristle and the beef and the gristle and

710
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:28,640
that it wasn't really a soft beef

711
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:30,880
it wasn't tender and that gristle and

712
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:33,200
that beef it just all kind of locked up

713
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,760
by a spot that the person was already

714
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:37,760
inflamed and so that became a real

715
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,919
obstruction so they had to get surgery

716
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:42,159
so they had to get a piece of the colon

717
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:44,159
cut out they had to get the obstruction

718
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:47,840
fixed right they had to get the

719
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:49,679
the obstruction removed and so

720
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,360
i've known many stories over the years

721
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:53,279
that are something similar to this but

722
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:55,440
this is different

723
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:56,480
than what's happening right now

724
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,080
so

725
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,840
here's the interesting thing you think

726
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,279
that this would set off an alarm out

727
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,480
there so people would know so they're

728
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:04,159
they're not getting their colons

729
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,080
intestinal tracts being cut out right

730
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:07,760
now for no reason with a misdiagnosis of

731
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,679
bowel obstruction when really it's left

732
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:11,760
over from a viral infection

733
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:13,919
creating temporary paralysis

734
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:15,760
of a colon in small intestinal tract you

735
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:16,720
think that the alarm would get set off

736
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,400
like don't you think it would be a

737
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,080
little suspicious now every single

738
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,320
hospital has people pouring in with the

739
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,760
bowel obstruction diagnosis

740
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,840
meanwhile they're lining up colon

741
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:28,159
surgeons and they're just

742
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:29,840
just cutting people's colons out

743
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:31,760
for this mysterious bowel obstruction

744
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:34,000
problem you think they would kind of put

745
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,760
two and two together and be like whoa

746
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,200
something's wrong here

747
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,279
why is everybody having a bowel

748
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:41,679
obstruction how come the hospital had 30

749
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:43,600
bowel obstructions just last night how

750
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:45,600
come this hospital down the road had

751
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:47,279
another 10 how about this hospital over

752
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,960
here shouldn't they communicate with

753
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:51,120
each other no they don't and this is how

754
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:53,600
medicine works these days and always has

755
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:55,279
in the past no communication doesn't

756
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,240
matter what happens to people and who

757
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:57,840
cares

758
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:00,720
that's how it's always been in medicine

759
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:02,880
in the world of medicine so

760
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:05,360
so right now people are getting for no

761
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:07,279
reason their bowels cut out

762
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:09,360
from a viral infection that's just

763
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:11,440
creating temporary paralysis and

764
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:13,279
inflammation in the colon and small

765
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:15,279
intestinal tract now with that being

766
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:17,679
said if you're somebody though

767
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:19,520
right that you have a lot of intestinal

768
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:22,640
tract problems and you're and you've

769
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:24,080
been known to have severe constipation

770
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,440
from blockages

771
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:27,440
that could be an entirely different

772
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,679
story if you're somebody that's known to

773
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:31,679
have in your life

774
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:32,720
severe constipation

775
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:35,520
to the point where you don't go to

776
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:38,320
bathroom for a week or so and it gets

777
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:41,200
blocked up and you have obstructions of

778
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:42,960
fecal matter that's different and you're

779
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,320
usually taking laxatives or taking

780
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,760
prescription laxatives and you're

781
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:48,320
dealing with lots of doctor visits

782
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:50,080
that's a different story than someone

783
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,440
who hasn't had any problems at all with

784
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,679
any of this and that's what's happening

785
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,960
the hospitals are being being filled up

786
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:56,880
all around this country and around the

787
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,799
world with people coming in that never

788
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:01,679
had a problem at all of their intestinal

789
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:03,600
tract or colon or any issues to that

790
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:04,960
degree maybe they had a little bit of

791
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,799
bloating maybe they have a little

792
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,559
digestive weakness maybe they have

793
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:10,480
something else going on right or

794
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:11,279
something like h pylori or whatever it

795
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,679
is

796
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:15,520
but they never had something serious and

797
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:17,840
then they get this bowel obstruction a

798
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:20,480
couple of weeks two three weeks later or

799
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:22,480
one week later after they had a cold

800
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:25,520
and that cold was a virus that virus

801
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,559
going around wasn't a cold per se

802
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,960
um

803
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:31,279
arlene says my daughter that has celiac

804
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,720
ended up in the emergency room with this

805
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:35,520
throwing up well that's what it is they

806
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:37,679
end up in the emergency room throwing up

807
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:39,520
that's how it works

808
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:40,640
and as they're in the emergency throwing

809
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:43,840
up

810
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:45,760
right now what the standard protocol in

811
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:47,440
the emergency room is they admit you

812
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:49,600
into the hospital they stick a pipe down

813
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:52,240
your throat into your stomach and they

814
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:54,799
just suck up and vacuum any contact

815
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:59,080
contents and any air for the next two

816
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:59,080
days while they prep you for surgery

817
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,159
so you're going to take a look here

818
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:06,640
michelle l good to see you why do

819
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:08,559
stomach nerves affect nerves in my feet

820
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,240
though

821
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:12,320
well you know the problem is with nerves

822
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,679
is they tend to all somewhat connect to

823
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,279
each other no matter what and they all

824
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:17,279
end up in the central nervous system

825
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:19,120
which is your brain so in the end they

826
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:20,960
all have the same root going to the

827
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:23,120
brain to one way or another

828
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,559
so all nerves connect to another nerve

829
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,480
which connects to another nerve that

830
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:27,520
ends up somewhere finding its way to the

831
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,200
brain

832
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,799
and that's why because you know if you

833
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,360
have other nerve sensitivities from

834
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:35,520
inflammation in other areas like some

835
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:37,760
type of neuropathy or any kind of nerve

836
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:39,679
sensations nerve nerve damage nerve

837
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:42,240
issues of any kind or just inflamed

838
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:44,399
nerves from neurotoxins and stuff like

839
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,919
that anytime your nerves get inflamed

840
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:48,159
other nerves can hurt too in other

841
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:49,520
places it's very difficult for a lot of

842
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:50,880
people that deal with it i want to show

843
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,559
you right here close up on this dish

844
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:55,279
right here to you guys so what i'm doing

845
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:58,559
is i'm cooking these garden potatoes

846
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:59,840
right patty pan squash onions

847
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:01,360
i'm gonna throw a pepper in there a

848
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:03,600
little bit i want to keep on steaming

849
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:05,760
this up a little bit too get it going

850
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:09,279
got got it on high heat

851
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:12,799
talking about bowel obstructions

852
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:15,399
rosita when i eat potatoes

853
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:18,880
i need potatoes my belly swells i have

854
00:30:15,399 --> 00:30:20,159
ulcerative colitis right so what i tell

855
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,000
people

856
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:23,919
and i talk to doctors a lot helping them

857
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,960
with their patients is

858
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:28,159
that

859
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:31,600
what's on the potato like what's on it

860
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:34,640
was it sour cream was it mayonnaise

861
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:37,440
was it oil was it any kind of fat like

862
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:39,200
an oil-based fat was it with

863
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,440
an animal fat

864
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:44,399
was it with any kind of animal fat did

865
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:46,399
it have lard on it was it fried

866
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:48,480
did it have any kind of other oil or fat

867
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:50,720
in there so that's another thing too to

868
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,000
keep did have milk cheese butter did it

869
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,000
have cream

870
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,159
did your potato have milk cheese butter

871
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,039
cream or anything like that

872
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:59,519
right

873
00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:01,600
did it have any of that going on because

874
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:03,519
that's what makes it really hard did you

875
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,399
have your potato with

876
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:07,200
bread

877
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:08,799
which was gluten-based bread did you

878
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,799
have anything like that too what did you

879
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:13,279
eat that day as well so what did you eat

880
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:14,880
that day as well so all kinds of things

881
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:17,200
matter

882
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:19,679
ulcerative colitis

883
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:21,679
ulcerative colitis right means you have

884
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:25,039
problems with a lot of foods too so it's

885
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:26,000
not just potato so if you eat potato

886
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:27,919
and your

887
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
belly swells

888
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:32,559
but the belly could be swelling for the

889
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:35,120
thing you ate that morning or the thing

890
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:38,000
you ate the day before or two to three

891
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:39,360
days before someone can have a piece of

892
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,840
gluten bread

893
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:43,760
a week before and get swelling a week

894
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:45,039
later because the gluten stays in the

895
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:47,360
system and then it feeds all the

896
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:50,080
critters so so that's what happens milk

897
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,080
cheese butter

898
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,559
eggs any of that will stay in the

899
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:57,039
intestinal tract long term

900
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:59,039
and then will feed

901
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:00,960
any kind of critter you got going on e

902
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:04,880
coli salmonella

903
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:07,039
right h pylori c diff streptococcus

904
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,799
so these critters

905
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:10,880
right they sit inside the intestinal

906
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:12,840
tract they sit inside the colon

907
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:15,600
and when we have ulcerative

908
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:17,200
colitis you guys know if you know

909
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:20,240
if you know medical medium information

910
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:22,559
ulcerative colitis is what critter like

911
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:25,120
what bug is the bug with ulcerative

912
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:26,960
colitis that bug is shingles virus the

913
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,720
shingles virus is inside the colon if

914
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,399
you have ulcerative colitis

915
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:32,159
it's inflaming the colon and that's why

916
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:33,600
the blood vessels break and the bleeding

917
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:35,679
occurs the rupturing of the blood

918
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:37,840
vessels occur it's from the shingles

919
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:40,080
virus right here so the shingles virus

920
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:43,519
sits inside the colon

921
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:46,799
okay makes a camp there for many years

922
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:48,880
and that becomes ulcerative colitis so

923
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:50,559
the shingles virus if you guys know

924
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:54,640
medical medium information shingles

925
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:57,200
virus loves what milk cheese butter

926
00:32:54,640 --> 00:33:00,240
even some soy

927

00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:13,600
this paralysis last

934
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:16,080
will it do away on its own yes it does

935
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:17,760
do away on its own

00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:47,200
and they're packed with information

952
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:48,799
that's mind-blowing over 300 symptoms

953
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,919
conditions i haven't talked about the

954
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:51,120
books in a while and i still want to

955
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:53,840
talk about them in more detail

956
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:56,000
eventually as you know as we get get to

957
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:57,840
get through but

958
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,440
check out the brainsaver books when you

961
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:04,159
mind

you'll have more information that's

963
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:07,519
mind-blowing it'll be really insane

964
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:09,520
christina s says how long will this

965
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:11,200
paralysis last would go away in its own

966
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:13,839
was the question before

967
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:16,399
yes tense the lat tends to last

968
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:19,119
for a couple of days

969
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:21,359
some people it lasts for a day

970
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:23,119
some people it's two days some people

971
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:25,440
it's three days

972
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:27,119
and then it starts to ease off and you

973
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,960
start to recover

974
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:30,560
you know and you and what a lot of

975
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,639
people do they'll sit in the hospital if

976
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:33,760
they have a smart doctor the doctor

977
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:37,440
would be like well you know what we're

978
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:39,440
not going to cut that person's colon out

979
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,440
we're going to just give it time and

980
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:44,079
then they watch the symptoms they watch

981
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:46,879
if the if the patient is feeling better

982
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:48,560
they watch as the patient's in less pain

983
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:49,919
they'll take the patient off of pain

984
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:51,359
medication

985
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:53,280
and they'll say well how are you feeling

986
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:54,960
today i know one person specifically

987
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,399
said you know what i'm out of here i was

988
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,800
in there with the pipe down into my

989
00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:00,640
stomach i was in there for a day and i

990
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,560
started feeling better and i wanted out

991
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:04,079
and they just ripped the pipe out

992
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,520
and they took the wipe out and they said

993
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:07,359
i need out of here

994
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:09,920
and but yet they were getting prepped

995
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:12,800
for surgery they were actually getting

996
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:14,880
prepped for surgery

997
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:18,800
which they didn't need

998
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:20,560
so yes it tends to move on its own get

999
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:23,760
this little critter off of here for now

1000
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,760
i want to chop up a pepper

1001
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:29,680
out of the garden here art says all the

1002
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:32,079
starch of the potatoes and squash in

1003
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:34,960
that dish you're cooking doesn't that

1004
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:36,640
promote feed yeast and fungal overgrowth

1005
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:40,640
well the information that you have that

1006
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:42,560
it does is misinformation so milk cheese

1007
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:45,920
butter eggs

1008
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:48,160
gluten feed all manners of bugs

1009
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,680
and here's the funny thing you're you're

1010
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:52,400
actually using medical medium

1011
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:54,480
information by saying that

1012
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:56,720
no one knew anything fed off of anything

1013
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,599
that's medical medium information

1014
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:00,320
so

1015
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:02,640
nobody thought bugs feed nobody believed

1016
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:04,800
viruses feed off of anything they still

1017
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:06,560
don't science still doesn't but that's

1018
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:09,200
medical medium information there's no

1019
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:10,160
science study that shows bugs actually

1020
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:13,280
feeding

1021
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:15,520
off of a potato because there never was

1022
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:17,680
there never will be a bug can't feed off

1023
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:19,119
of a potato but a bug can feed off of

1024
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:20,560
gluten but they don't have any tests

1025
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:22,079
showing that out there studies showing

1026
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:23,440
that either because it's medical medium

1027
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:25,680
information

1028
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:27,839
so what you're saying is doesn't that

1029
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:30,320
starch feed

1030
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:32,000
any kind of bugs like yeast and fungus

1031
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:34,079
and stuff and other things and what

1032
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,440
you're saying is i'm going to tell you

1033
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:37,520
medical medium

1034
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:39,839
i'm going to ask you a question you know

1035
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:41,599
that is your information medical medium

1036
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:42,800
because nobody knew anything fed on

1037
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:44,640
anything

1038
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,000
so you heard it from somewhere else that

1039
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:48,480
started from somewhere else i heard from

1040
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,160
somewhere else and they twisted it up

1041
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,599
and now they now they're saying that

1042
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,440
that will feed on this one it doesn't

1043
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:55,680
feed on this

1044
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:58,480
the whole concept

1045
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:02,000
of critters feeding

1046
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:04,720
on a food or eating is medical medium

1047
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,720
information

1048
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:11,520
but i appreciate the question it's fun

1049
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:12,880
to watch your own information

1050
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:15,760
come back to you

1051
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:17,040
it comes back to you

1052
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:20,000
skewed

1053
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:22,160
twisted up but it still comes back right

1054
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,599
it still comes back to me which is fun

1055
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:25,680
to see it come back

1056
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:27,839
but it's sad at the same time because

1057
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:29,359
you see that information come back

1058
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:31,760
twist it up

1059
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:33,040
it's like twisted up and used against

1060
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:35,520
the very

1061
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:37,119
foods you're making right so here i am

1062
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:39,040
the guy that put the information out

1063
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:41,119
there about how all these bugs feed on

1064
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:42,640
stuff feed on food and they actually eat

1065
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:44,960
right so that's medical beam information

1066
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:47,839
i go into great depths about that in the

1067
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,839
brain saver books

1068
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:53,599
and here i am right

1069
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:56,640
being told by someone how

1070
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:58,320
isn't that going to feed bugs

1071
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,839
yeah being the person that put the

1072
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,680
information out there to begin with i'm

1073
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:03,440
not going to be serving you guys a meal

1074
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:05,040
that will feed the bugs

1075
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:08,079
michelle elle said this information

1076
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,880
saved so many lives aw thank you

1077
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:10,720
but

1078
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,720
but anyway i'm happy you're asking that

1079
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:15,359
question by the way does it feed

1080
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:17,440
anything so let's talk about that

1081
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:19,119
if you eat gluten gluten will feed those

1082
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,320
bugs nobody knew that you guys have to

1083
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:22,800
remember

1084
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:24,720
all the eat better authors or eat better

1085
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,440
books and eat better doctors and all

1086
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:28,720
that

1087
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:31,119
all they knew was to eat better and they

1088
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:32,480
they only believed that processed food

1089
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:34,320
would give you heart disease

1090
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:36,480
cardiovascular problems that's that's

1091
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:38,400
all that they had right

1092
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,480
medical medium information

1093
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:44,240
brought the truth out that gluten

1094
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:47,520
actually feeds bugs it'll feed viruses

1095
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:49,440
and pathogens and bacteria

1096
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:51,280
and same thing with virus you know same

1097
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:52,079
thing like

1098
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,839
so

1099
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:55,440
and medical medium information goes back

1100
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:57,440
decades

1101
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:00,240
goes back decades

1102
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:02,400
nobody knew gluten fed anything only

1103
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,440
medical medium information talked about

1104
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,400
that

1105
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,160
and

1106
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:08,400
so with that

1107
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:10,320
it's like what does what does these

1108
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:12,880
bacteria and microbes that are not

1109
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:14,640
beneficial what do they feed off of milk

1110
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:18,000
cheese butter

1111
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:18,000

1130
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:56,000
way that's not the end of the world but

1131
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:58,640
don't do corn products if you're

1132
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,560
somebody that's really has any kind of

1133
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:02,800

cornstarch and corn products and

1136
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:08,720

1137
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:10,240
all that stuff cornbread and everything

1138
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:12,560
else

1139
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:14,880
sierra vasati says is the vacuum of the

1140
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:17,599
stomach needed for the person to improve

1141
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:20,240
or can a protocol be done at home versus

1142
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:22,319
the er yes protocol can be done always

1143
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:23,760
ask your doctor so sarah make sure you

1144
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:25,760
talk to your doctor

1145
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:28,560
but yes if it was me i would try to do a

1146
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:30,800
protocol at home and i would try to

1147
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:32,560
avoid the the vacuum pipe going down

1148
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,079
through my stomach because into your

1149
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:36,319
stomach because i know that that

1150
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:38,720
wouldn't be what you needed

1151
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:41,040
they do that

1152
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:42,079
because they're trying to get air out

1153
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:44,960
right

1154
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:44,960
is what they're doing

1155
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:49,599
but being that it's not a true

1156
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:51,680
obstruction and just a paralysis you

1157
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:53,839
don't need the pipe but always ask your

1158
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:56,319
doctor no matter what whatever condition

1159
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:58,160
you're in right so i'm i got a pepper in

1160
