[2.52 - 6.90] for day one of the medical medium wild
[4.50 - 8.22] blueberry drinks challenge I'm excited
[6.90 - 10.02] actually glad you guys are here we're
[8.22 - 11.70] going to talk about how alcohol destroys
[10.02 - 13.44] the brain so that's going to be one of
[11.70 - 14.52] the topics the main topic really it's
[13.44 - 18.06] going to be really fun but we're making
[14.52 - 19.32] three drinks get ready brain detox tonic
[18.06 - 20.64] which is actually really cool we're
[19.32 - 22.38] gonna make the wild blueberry apple
[20.64 - 25.44] cider we're gonna make the wild
[22.38 - 27.36] blueberry sangria I'm pumped up I'm
[25.44 - 29.16] excited let's get down to it you guys
[27.36 - 30.42] and just so you know we got a lot of
[29.16 - 32.82] cool things over here I'm going to tell
[30.42 - 34.32] you right now we've got like some killer
[32.82 - 35.96] stuff right here I got oranges because
[34.32 - 38.34] I'm gonna be squeezing some orange juice
[35.96 - 40.26] we've got the wild blueberry juice we
[38.34 - 42.18] got everything ready and rigged we got
[40.26 - 44.22] some fruit we're gonna need we got it
[42.18 - 45.06] all I'm excited I got the burner right
[44.22 - 47.64] here
[45.06 - 49.74] I got a pot on there so we're doing good
[47.64 - 51.48] but I want to talk about alcohol for a
[49.74 - 52.68] couple of minutes and by the way day one
[51.48 - 54.78] of the medical meanwhile blueberry
[52.68 - 57.60] drinks challenge just so you know
[54.78 - 60.06] so I'm in the alcohol chapter right here
[57.60 - 61.08] in the brain saber book as you guys can
[60.06 - 63.72] see
[61.08 - 65.58] and I know people are drinking they're
[63.72 - 68.22] drinking during the holidays I'm not
[65.58 - 69.84] judging anybody okay if they want to
[68.22 - 73.20] drink they can drink that's perfectly
[69.84 - 75.60] fine but what happens in my house right
[73.20 - 77.16] I don't bring out the alcohol I just
[75.60 - 78.84] don't I don't bring out all the alcohol
[77.16 - 80.52] and everything like that you know go
[78.84 - 83.22] somewhere else and you can drink right
[80.52 - 85.68] my house it's bringing out the wild
[83.22 - 88.86] blueberry drinks that's what I do okay
[85.68 - 90.90] it's anything but alcohol all right
[88.86 - 93.60] anyway so
[90.90 - 95.70] yeah I know total down all right anyway
[93.60 - 97.14] brain saver I'm gonna read a little bit
[95.70 - 99.60] out of here then we're gonna make some
[97.14 - 102.18] drinks three drinks I'm pumped up I'm
[99.60 - 105.66] glad you guys are here I'm excited
[102.18 - 107.40] let's do it so alcohol right throughout
[105.66 - 109.80] the centuries all the way up through
[107.40 - 111.48] today we have Associated someone who's
[109.80 - 112.74] had too much to drink with slurred
[111.48 - 118.26] speech
[112.74 - 120.60] I had a lot to drink wood speech right
[118.26 - 122.76] the inability to walk in a straight line
[120.60 - 125.76] the inability to think or speak clearly
[122.76 - 127.44] we call it being drunk
[125.76 - 129.66] anyway you guys I'm into brain saver
[127.44 - 132.12] books I'm on page 158 if you want to
[129.66 - 133.40] read along so got the brain saver book
[132.12 - 136.38] right there
[133.40 - 138.66] 158 the alcohol check have you read the
[136.38 - 140.52] alcohol chapter it's sick it's insane
[138.66 - 143.88] the information is just mind-blowing
[140.52 - 145.86] about what alcohol does to the brain so
[143.88 - 148.26] let's get into it a little bit
[145.86 - 150.36] we call it being drunk if it becomes
[148.26 - 153.24] more severe and that person is vomiting
[150.36 - 155.40] or anything right incapacitated we may
[153.24 - 157.14] call it alcohol poisoning you've heard
[155.40 - 159.54] that right well that person has alcohol
[157.14 - 161.10] poisoning yeah that person drank too
[159.54 - 162.48] much they're they're holding on to the
[161.10 - 165.00] toilet and they're throwing up and
[162.48 - 166.38] they're vomiting all night long that
[165.00 - 167.94] person has alcohol poison that person
[166.38 - 169.44] was hospitalized because of alcohol
[167.94 - 172.98] poisoning right
[169.44 - 174.96] so that's that's what we call it and
[172.98 - 177.66] that's how it works we may call it
[174.96 - 180.30] alcohol poisoning do we really know what
[177.66 - 184.62] happens when our bloodstream is
[180.30 - 187.68] saturated with a high volume of alcohol
[184.62 - 188.76] do we really know what's happening we
[187.68 - 191.06] don't
[188.76 - 193.38] and we never did
[191.06 - 195.36] mind-blowing information I'm about to go
[193.38 - 197.88] into I'm in the alcohol chapter right
[195.36 - 199.20] now out of brain saver you just if you
[197.88 - 201.06] just landed here where day one of the
[199.20 - 203.76] medical meeting wild blueberry drinks
[201.06 - 205.68] challenge we're making three drinks
[203.76 - 208.14] without alcohol which is really cool
[205.68 - 210.84] we're making a brain detox tonic which
[208.14 - 212.52] doesn't have alcohol in it duh we're
[210.84 - 214.74] making the wild blueberry apple cider
[212.52 - 217.26] we're making the wild blueberry sangria
[214.74 - 220.14] which I'm really excited about
[217.26 - 222.54] we assumed because medical research and
[220.14 - 224.64] science assume
[222.54 - 227.10] that more alcohol in the bloodstream
[224.64 - 228.36] leads directly to these actions and
[227.10 - 231.60] symptoms
[228.36 - 234.06] that alcohol itself affects the brain to
[231.60 - 235.68] cause these experiences
[234.06 - 238.44] here's the truth
[235.68 - 241.02] no one knows exactly what happens inside
[238.44 - 244.44] the brain with alcohol
[241.02 - 246.78] that is the truth they don't know
[244.44 - 248.88] medical science and research does not
[246.78 - 250.20] know what happens when someone's
[248.88 - 253.50] drinking
[250.20 - 255.36] and alcohol enters the body they do not
[253.50 - 257.22] know what happens to the brain they
[255.36 - 259.08] don't have a tool to figure it out they
[257.22 - 260.94] don't have a way to measure it they
[259.08 - 263.58] don't have a way to understand it they
[260.94 - 265.74] don't have some kind of technology that
[263.58 - 268.02] actually shows the brain under alcohol
[265.74 - 269.52] and what occurs to the brain they don't
[268.02 - 272.16] have any of that
[269.52 - 274.32] all these centuries up until now modern
[272.16 - 276.60] day science right this minute does not
[274.32 - 279.42] know what happens when alcohol gets to
[276.60 - 281.34] the brain and we're going to talk about
[279.42 - 283.38] part of what happens is we got a lot of
[281.34 - 284.28] info in here
[283.38 - 286.44] foreign
[284.28 - 288.06] so
[286.44 - 290.22] this is really cool this information
[288.06 - 291.60] okay
[290.22 - 293.94] and so
[291.60 - 295.62] when alcohol goes to the bloodstream and
[293.94 - 297.30] leads directly to these actions and
[295.62 - 298.68] symptoms they don't know what causes
[297.30 - 300.78] that and what that means that alcohol
[298.68 - 303.12] itself affects the brain to cause these
[300.78 - 304.74] experiences here's the truth no one
[303.12 - 306.08] knows exactly what happens inside the
[304.74 - 309.24] brain with alcohol
[306.08 - 312.12] intoxication is not fully understood
[309.24 - 313.92] it's only one aspect of what happens to
[312.12 - 316.26] the brain when someone drinks so they'll
[313.92 - 318.90] be like that person's intoxicated that
[316.26 - 321.12] person has alcohol poisoning that's as
[318.90 - 324.36] far as they can go but what happens
[321.12 - 326.40] inside our brain another story
[324.36 - 328.86] entirely another story
[326.40 - 331.20] so medical research in science is not
[328.86 - 333.24] going to also put 250 million dollars
[331.20 - 335.04] into trying to figure out what happens
[333.24 - 337.44] when someone gets alcohol in their
[335.04 - 338.88] system and it goes to the brain
[337.44 - 340.14] but we're going to talk about it right
[338.88 - 344.28] here because it's really interesting
[340.14 - 347.70] it's one of the reasons why alcohol in
[344.28 - 350.94] tinctures alcohol and supplements of all
[347.70 - 353.28] kinds is a bad idea not only does the
[350.94 - 356.28] alcohol destroy all the different
[353.28 - 358.26] phytochemical compounds in tinctures and
[356.28 - 359.04] pill form and anything that alcohol's in
[358.26 - 361.74] right
[359.04 - 364.52] but alcohol alone is bad for the liver
[361.74 - 364.52] bad for the brain
[365.46 - 370.02] so
[367.02 - 372.42] alcohol's effects start out with what is
[370.02 - 374.22] called a little tipsy
[372.42 - 376.32] hey that person's just a little tipsy
[374.22 - 379.38] I'm feeling kind of Tipsy some say
[376.32 - 381.66] alcohol helps them loosen up and speak
[379.38 - 383.70] their mind right so when you drink it's
[381.66 - 386.04] like no I'm getting looser now now I can
[383.70 - 388.50] say what I can say now I can you know
[386.04 - 390.78] now I got some confidence back so a lot
[388.50 - 393.06] of people be like okay well I have to
[390.78 - 394.68] drink to loosen up I'm around some
[393.06 - 396.78] people I'm around I'm at a meeting
[394.68 - 398.58] whatever with a bunch of people
[396.78 - 400.74] um you know I'm at an after-hour party
[398.58 - 403.14] it's time to loosen up and be more
[400.74 - 405.18] myself and that's what people do they'll
[403.14 - 406.74] they'll do alcohol for that some say
[405.18 - 408.84] alcohol helps them loosen up and speak
[406.74 - 411.84] their mind some say a couple of beers
[408.84 - 414.78] helps them relax
[411.84 - 417.72] some say wine helps numb them out right
[414.78 - 421.62] have a hard day you come home you have a
[417.72 - 424.14] glass of wine and then it numbs you out
[421.62 - 426.72] yet how does alcohol seem to loosen them
[424.14 - 428.10] up relax them or numb them out how does
[426.72 - 429.78] it work
[428.10 - 431.40] and that's where medical research and
[429.78 - 434.82] science is completely unaware they don't
[431.40 - 437.16] know how it loosens the person up
[434.82 - 439.02] when they say that how it numbs them out
[437.16 - 441.90] when they say it numbs them up
[439.02 - 445.20] how to help relax them so they don't
[441.90 - 447.18] know those answers it's as simple as all
[445.20 - 448.86] they have right now on record as you
[447.18 - 451.44] drink
[448.86 - 454.14] and a person says it helps me loosen up
[451.44 - 456.24] that's as scientific as it gets the
[454.14 - 458.64] person drinks
[456.24 - 460.32] and they're a little tipsy that's all
[458.64 - 462.66] they have they don't have anything else
[460.32 - 465.78] in medical research and science or the
[462.66 - 468.72] person drinks and it numbs them up
[465.78 - 471.30] they can have a team of scientists
[468.72 - 472.74] all this money right lab technicians and
[471.30 - 475.26] they still won't know when someone says
[472.74 - 477.06] whoa yeah that drink helps to relax me
[475.26 - 479.10] or that drink numbs me up they won't
[477.06 - 482.40] have an answer that's scientifically
[479.10 - 483.96] proven or accurate or anything else
[482.40 - 486.24] because they're completely in the dark
[483.96 - 487.98] so you guys if you just got in here
[486.24 - 490.20] we're talking about how alcohol destroys
[487.98 - 493.02] the brain I thought it was a great topic
[490.20 - 495.12] we're in brain saver we're on page 158
[493.02 - 497.58] if you guys want to read along with me
[495.12 - 499.38] and we're doing three drinks today so
[497.58 - 501.18] I'm excited too we're day one of the
[499.38 - 503.22] medical medium wild blueberry drinks
[501.18 - 505.32] Challenge and we're doing the brain
[503.22 - 507.90] detox tonic we're doing the wild
[505.32 - 510.90] blueberry sangria okay and we're doing a
[507.90 - 513.30] wild blueberry apple cider here we go
[510.90 - 514.74] this next section is called brain
[513.30 - 517.08] charades
[514.74 - 520.32] as we've discussed throughout this book
[517.08 - 521.94] your brain survives on glucose that's
[520.32 - 523.44] what it runs on
[521.94 - 526.86] our brain
[523.44 - 527.82] lives off of glucose right that's an
[526.86 - 529.56] orange
[527.82 - 532.08] right so
[529.56 - 534.78] we need sugar for the brain if you take
[532.08 - 537.36] sugar away from the brain the brain
[534.78 - 540.42] starts to deteriorate it starts to die
[537.36 - 543.24] it has to have glucose as fuel it has to
[540.42 - 546.84] have sugar blood sugar that's what keeps
[543.24 - 549.42] our brain alive and active
[546.84 - 551.94] a lack of glucose to your brain can
[549.42 - 554.34] slowly starve it over time
[551.94 - 556.62] that's why when people literally remove
[554.34 - 559.20] everything that's a carbohydrate
[556.62 - 561.48] everything that's a sugar whether
[559.20 - 564.30] natural not natural whatever everything
[561.48 - 565.86] possible that's a glucose or sugar they
[564.30 - 567.84] literally hit the wall they can't
[565.86 - 570.12] function they can't work and they get in
[567.84 - 572.76] big trouble they can't be productive
[570.12 - 574.74] and if glucose were eliminated from your
[572.76 - 577.38] bloodstream and never entered your brain
[574.74 - 580.32] you could go into brain failure within
[577.38 - 583.02] moments your brain starts to die within
[580.32 - 585.48] five seconds without getting sugar to it
[583.02 - 588.78] so without getting glucose to your brain
[585.48 - 590.58] it starts to die within seconds think
[588.78 - 592.86] about that for a minute
[590.58 - 594.48] get ready for this
[592.86 - 598.38] alcohol
[594.48 - 600.36] is the all-time trick on your brain
[598.38 - 603.00] that's because your brain believes
[600.36 - 605.70] alcohol is sugar
[603.00 - 607.86] sugar it can use so when you drink a
[605.70 - 610.26] drink with alcohol in it
[607.86 - 614.10] your brain gets tricked out
[610.26 - 615.36] it believes it's pure sugar or sugar of
[614.10 - 618.84] some kind
[615.36 - 621.54] so it's an actual trick on the brain
[618.84 - 624.12] it believes it's like the glucose that's
[621.54 - 626.64] created by the foods you eat so when you
[624.12 - 630.42] drink an alcohol beverage
[626.64 - 633.48] your brain believes that the alcohol
[630.42 - 636.06] is like a natural sugar like a sugar
[633.48 - 637.20] from an orange an apple a sugar from
[636.06 - 638.70] anything
[637.20 - 641.10] okay
[638.70 - 642.84] so it believes it's like the glucose
[641.10 - 645.20] that's created by the foods you eat that
[642.84 - 649.14] contain carbohydrates and sugar really
[645.20 - 651.30] alcohol is methyl sugar this would be
[649.14 - 653.82] mind-blowing when you hear this it's a
[651.30 - 655.74] hybrid of what sugar
[653.82 - 657.54] what was sugar
[655.74 - 660.24] so think about that
[657.54 - 661.68] so your brain thinks alcohol is actually
[660.24 - 664.02] usable sugar
[661.68 - 667.62] and instead
[664.02 - 669.84] it's not it's methyl sugar it's what
[667.62 - 672.84] sugar was
[669.84 - 675.42] which is this is incredible it's more of
[672.84 - 678.30] a vaporized sugar versus a usable sugar
[675.42 - 681.06] so when you drink an alcoholic beverage
[678.30 - 684.32] it's a vaporized sugar
[681.06 - 689.58] not a usable sugar
[684.32 - 691.50] alcohol's Essence is sugar yet it's not
[689.58 - 692.70] and this is really cool where it goes
[691.50 - 695.28] right here you guys I'm reading out a
[692.70 - 697.44] brain saver on page 158 still
[695.28 - 700.14] incredible information right here you're
[697.44 - 702.90] also here with me right now day one for
[700.14 - 704.22] the free medical meeting wild blueberry
[702.90 - 706.56] drinks challenge we're making three
[704.22 - 708.36] drinks hang in there for the ride it's
[706.56 - 710.70] gonna be fun I got the burner on right
[708.36 - 712.14] here I got all kinds of stuff around me
[710.70 - 714.90] right here stuff over here stuff all
[712.14 - 717.48] over here it's gonna be really cool
[714.90 - 721.14] actually exciting I love this
[717.48 - 723.84] so you guys this is incredible
[721.14 - 725.40] information it just blows my mind
[723.84 - 728.46] okay
[725.40 - 731.30] as a result of this charade that's
[728.46 - 734.22] played on your brain that leads it to
[731.30 - 738.20] identifying alcohol as critically needed
[734.22 - 738.20] glucose several things go wrong
[738.42 - 743.76] so when you drink the alcoholic beverage
[741.78 - 745.56] and remember medical research designs
[743.76 - 747.24] that they don't know this
[745.56 - 748.80] they don't have a study they don't know
[747.24 - 750.42] what happens when you drink they don't
[748.80 - 752.04] know why someone loosens up they don't
[750.42 - 754.38] know anything
[752.04 - 756.54] so as a result of this charade plate on
[754.38 - 758.76] your brain that leads it to identify
[756.54 - 761.16] alcohol as critically needed glucose
[758.76 - 762.96] several things go wrong
[761.16 - 767.22] check this out
[762.96 - 770.04] the more alcohol in your bloodstream the
[767.22 - 771.66] harder it is for your brain to use any
[770.04 - 772.86] real source of glucose in your
[771.66 - 774.66] bloodstream
[772.86 - 777.36] this is original Advanced information
[774.66 - 778.98] from above it's not stuff that you know
[777.36 - 781.80] gathered off the internet and thrown in
[778.98 - 785.34] a book this is unique information from
[781.80 - 788.22] above always proven right or or never
[785.34 - 790.20] proven wrong so keep that in mind the
[788.22 - 792.36] medical medium book series has never
[790.20 - 795.42] been proven Wrong by science research or
[792.36 - 798.92] scientists yet instead just poached and
[795.42 - 798.92] proven right constantly
[799.38 - 804.24] so this is a really important section
[801.78 - 805.98] right here probably one of the most
[804.24 - 807.48] important parts right here so when you
[805.98 - 809.58] think about this I just want to go over
[807.48 - 811.14] this with you one more time because it's
[809.58 - 812.76] that mind-blowing
[811.14 - 814.98] so
[812.76 - 817.98] the sugar and alcohol is really not
[814.98 - 820.26] there it's the ghost of sugar but your
[817.98 - 823.80] brain thinks it's sugar it's glucose
[820.26 - 825.96] just like something from a fruit or any
[823.80 - 828.18] food
[825.96 - 830.04] as a result of this charade play it on
[828.18 - 831.66] your brain because it's a trick played
[830.04 - 833.34] on your brain so when you have a glass
[831.66 - 835.14] of wine when you have a shot when you
[833.34 - 838.02] have alcohol when you have a tincture
[835.14 - 840.00] with alcohol in it yeah a tincture with
[838.02 - 842.28] alcohol in it
[840.00 - 845.76] herbal tincture with alcohol in it
[842.28 - 845.76] terrible terrible
[845.82 - 850.98] your brain identifies alcohol as a
[849.00 - 853.44] critically needed glucose so what your
[850.98 - 857.10] brain thinks is that it's critical
[853.44 - 859.26] so when you take that alcoholic tincture
[857.10 - 861.00] when you take that supplement that has
[859.26 - 862.38] alcohol in it when you drink a drink
[861.00 - 864.84] when you have a glass of wine whatever
[862.38 - 866.52] form of alcohol you're doing
[864.84 - 869.46] your brain
[866.52 - 872.34] thinks it's actual usable critically
[869.46 - 874.26] immediate glucose
[872.34 - 876.30] but several things go wrong the more
[874.26 - 877.98] alcohol in your bloodstream the harder
[876.30 - 879.24] it is for your brain to use any real
[877.98 - 881.60] source of glucose you know what that
[879.24 - 881.60] means
[881.82 - 890.36] what that means is without usable
[885.30 - 890.36] glucose in your bloodstream you die
[890.58 - 895.50] your brain runs on sugar
[892.68 - 898.08] it starts dying within five seconds
[895.50 - 901.22] without glucose
[898.08 - 901.22] so you see where it's going
[902.28 - 907.08] the more alcohol in your bloodstream the
[904.50 - 909.06] harder it harder it is for your brain to
[907.08 - 911.46] use any real source of glucose in your
[909.06 - 915.48] bloodstream so what happens next
[911.46 - 918.90] if it's hard for your brain to use any
[915.48 - 923.16] usable glucose resource in your
[918.90 - 926.82] bloodstream your brain starts to starve
[923.16 - 927.72] the more alcohol you drink the more the
[926.82 - 931.44] brain
[927.72 - 934.58] cannot use a glucose to keep it alive
[931.44 - 934.58] how crazy is that
[935.70 - 940.38] in alcohol dominates over any glucose
[938.58 - 943.32] storage left in the brain so here's
[940.38 - 945.42] here's how it works your brain has
[943.32 - 948.06] glucose storages
[945.42 - 949.80] that it pulls from so that if you don't
[948.06 - 952.80] get glucose to your brain within five
[949.80 - 955.20] seconds you hopefully won't die because
[952.80 - 957.60] your brain has enough glucose storage to
[955.20 - 959.52] get you by a few more seconds before
[957.60 - 962.48] that next round of glucose gets the
[959.52 - 962.48] brain to save it
[963.00 - 967.94] but what happens is the more alcohol
[964.86 - 970.32] inside your bloodstream the less chance
[967.94 - 974.18] your brain is going to be able to use
[970.32 - 977.76] any usable glucose in even including
[974.18 - 980.94] stored usable glucose in the brain it
[977.76 - 983.52] won't be usable anymore less and less
[980.94 - 984.90] becomes usable you guys just got here
[983.52 - 987.00] we're talking about the brain starving
[984.90 - 988.56] the starving of glucose because of
[987.00 - 990.66] alcohol use
[988.56 - 992.04] drinking anything with alcohol that's
[990.66 - 995.46] what we're talking about
[992.04 - 997.74] we're on page 159 of the brain saver
[995.46 - 999.30] book's greatest book of all time books
[997.74 - 1002.42] of all time if you guys have checked him
[999.30 - 1006.14] out and read them there's also
[1002.42 - 1008.84] brain saver protocols okay
[1006.14 - 1010.22] and we're day one of the free Wild
[1008.84 - 1012.32] blueberry drinks challenge which is
[1010.22 - 1014.24] really cool
[1012.32 - 1015.98] all right let's get into this a little
[1014.24 - 1017.60] bit more and more because this is really
[1015.98 - 1020.30] incredible
[1017.60 - 1023.18] so alcohol dominates over any glucose
[1020.30 - 1025.64] storage you have left in your brain
[1023.18 - 1028.28] your liver is your main glucose storage
[1025.64 - 1032.54] bin so our liver
[1028.28 - 1036.86] is the main glucose storage bin
[1032.54 - 1040.36] it's supposed to Harbor all this glucose
[1036.86 - 1040.36] that helps to protect us
[1040.88 - 1046.10] its job is to release glucose
[1043.28 - 1048.38] congruently as your brain needs it so
[1046.10 - 1049.82] your liver releases that glucose as your
[1048.38 - 1051.68] brain needs it
[1049.82 - 1054.92] there are moments when we aren't getting
[1051.68 - 1057.14] enough sugar or glucose or fructose or
[1054.92 - 1059.72] any kind of carbohydrate in our diet and
[1057.14 - 1060.92] we go into glucose deficits in the
[1059.72 - 1063.68] bloodstream
[1060.92 - 1065.66] your liver's job in that case is to
[1063.68 - 1068.60] release glucose so your brain doesn't
[1065.66 - 1070.88] completely starve
[1068.60 - 1072.56] so your liver has a job and that's why
[1070.88 - 1073.88] it's critical to keep our livers healthy
[1072.56 - 1076.40] that's why medical medium information
[1073.88 - 1079.34] has advanced liver knowledge like a
[1076.40 - 1082.04] Liver Rescue right and and all the other
[1079.34 - 1084.68] medical medium books
[1082.04 - 1088.04] and so the job of the liver is to Harbor
[1084.68 - 1091.40] and keep healthy glucose storage bins so
[1088.04 - 1092.60] that when you run low
[1091.40 - 1094.94] yeah
[1092.60 - 1098.12] when you run low
[1094.94 - 1099.92] that glucose gets needed and used how
[1098.12 - 1101.48] incredible Lorraine L says this chapter
[1099.92 - 1103.82] put me off
[1101.48 - 1106.16] ever having another drop of alcohol
[1103.82 - 1108.26] incredible
[1106.16 - 1110.48] this includes circumstances where you
[1108.26 - 1113.12] aren't getting you weren't eating for a
[1110.48 - 1115.70] long period of time if you don't eat for
[1113.12 - 1118.04] a long period of time which could happen
[1115.70 - 1120.44] for instance say you get food poisoning
[1118.04 - 1122.78] say you're one of those lucky people
[1120.44 - 1125.78] or unfortunate people however you want
[1122.78 - 1127.88] to look at it that gets food poisoning a
[1125.78 - 1130.52] bad case of food poisoning how about a
[1127.88 - 1131.96] stomach flu too and you can't eat
[1130.52 - 1134.36] anything
[1131.96 - 1137.00] for a while food poisoning especially
[1134.36 - 1139.94] where you can't even drink anything
[1137.00 - 1142.16] you're in the hospital you're hooked up
[1139.94 - 1143.96] to Morphine you have the worst stomach
[1142.16 - 1146.00] pain you ever had in your life because
[1143.96 - 1148.28] you got E coli poisoning or some other
[1146.00 - 1150.68] foodborne illness
[1148.28 - 1153.08] and you're suffering for a day and you
[1150.68 - 1157.04] can't really get any glucose then your
[1153.08 - 1159.14] liver releases glucose Darcy Lee says I
[1157.04 - 1161.60] was drinking vodka because I was low
[1159.14 - 1163.64] carb what a huge mistake
[1161.60 - 1165.56] you're on Facebook that's really
[1163.64 - 1168.02] interesting I know wait to hear the rest
[1165.56 - 1170.42] of what I have to read you guys it's
[1168.02 - 1172.58] like mind-blowing
[1170.42 - 1174.14] so this includes circumstances where you
[1172.58 - 1176.66] aren't eating enough in a long period of
[1174.14 - 1179.72] time remember without glucose your brain
[1176.66 - 1182.48] can't survive your brain
[1179.72 - 1186.20] cannot survive
[1182.48 - 1188.62] without glucose it dies fast and it gets
[1186.20 - 1188.62] us in trouble
[1189.08 - 1194.84] the liver fulfilling this role is why
[1191.60 - 1199.36] someone can do a water fast and their
[1194.84 - 1199.36] brain can survive the experience
[1200.12 - 1203.00] and that's the problem even with water
[1201.98 - 1205.64] fasting
[1203.00 - 1207.50] water fasting so-called experts don't
[1205.64 - 1209.48] even realize it
[1207.50 - 1211.46] the person and how much glucose they
[1209.48 - 1213.56] have in their liver or glycogen storage
[1211.46 - 1215.18] they have in their brain determines if
[1213.56 - 1216.56] they can even water fast but no one
[1215.18 - 1217.70] would ever know that there's no way to
[1216.56 - 1219.14] measure that there's no way to
[1217.70 - 1221.48] understand that that's why some people
[1219.14 - 1223.22] go into a water fast they bottom out
[1221.48 - 1225.26] real fast
[1223.22 - 1227.18] and they hit the wall and they're in bad
[1225.26 - 1229.04] shape and then other people can seem
[1227.18 - 1230.78] like they go longer and longer on a
[1229.04 - 1233.96] water fast because what they don't
[1230.78 - 1235.58] realize is they're living off of glucose
[1233.96 - 1237.88] storage that's sitting inside their
[1235.58 - 1237.88] liver
[1238.04 - 1241.88] so the liver fulfilling this role is why
[1240.08 - 1243.44] someone who can you know can do a water
[1241.88 - 1244.94] fast and their brain can survive the
[1243.44 - 1247.10] experience because the liver is
[1244.94 - 1252.14] releasing ample glucose for the brain
[1247.10 - 1254.48] our liver releases glucose for our brain
[1252.14 - 1256.58] glycogen reserves in the brain and
[1254.48 - 1258.68] glucose reserves in the liver determine
[1256.58 - 1261.38] how long someone can withstand a water
[1258.68 - 1264.26] fast now not everybody's liver functions
[1261.38 - 1268.04] that well and that's another thing too
[1264.26 - 1270.38] I've seen people do a water fast
[1268.04 - 1272.06] and they can do it longer
[1270.38 - 1274.04] because their liver was functioning
[1272.06 - 1275.78] better and they had a large glucose
[1274.04 - 1277.88] storage bin and then I've seen other
[1275.78 - 1281.18] people do water fast
[1277.88 - 1282.08] and they were just boom down for the
[1281.18 - 1283.88] count
[1282.08 - 1286.22] the liver wasn't a healthy liver didn't
[1283.88 - 1287.96] have a large glucose storage they had no
[1286.22 - 1289.76] glucose to feed the brain why they were
[1287.96 - 1291.08] just out of water
[1289.76 - 1292.64] and they just went
[1291.08 - 1295.40] [Music]
[1292.64 - 1298.34] even like into psychosis
[1295.40 - 1300.20] where they just went into psychosis like
[1298.34 - 1303.68] boom
[1300.20 - 1305.78] it's that person you hear about
[1303.68 - 1307.58] through somebody for somebody right that
[1305.78 - 1308.72] was at a fasting clinic and they were
[1307.58 - 1310.82] literally
[1308.72 - 1312.74] in a psychotic episode when they weren't
[1310.82 - 1314.06] ever psychotic before
[1312.74 - 1317.12] it's because
[1314.06 - 1319.70] they didn't have enough glucose storage
[1317.12 - 1321.20] bin inside their liver to get to their
[1319.70 - 1322.64] brain while they were water fasting but
[1321.20 - 1323.72] I'm just using water fasting as an
[1322.64 - 1325.34] example
[1323.72 - 1327.50] I'm talking about everyday living we
[1325.34 - 1329.24] need that glucose and our liver releases
[1327.50 - 1331.70] that glucose to the brain on everyday
[1329.24 - 1334.52] living too
[1331.70 - 1336.56] many people's glucose storage bins can
[1334.52 - 1338.72] be minimally due
[1336.56 - 1340.76] to the liver being sluggish or stagnant
[1338.72 - 1343.04] wrote a whole book about that
[1340.76 - 1345.32] taught about that for years
[1343.04 - 1347.12] so drinking alcohol can affect these
[1345.32 - 1348.74] people more than alcohol affects people
[1347.12 - 1349.82] with strong livers you ever hear that I
[1348.74 - 1351.32] just want to go over this for a second
[1349.82 - 1353.06] because this is really an incredible
[1351.32 - 1354.98] point
[1353.06 - 1357.74] you heard that person where I can handle
[1354.98 - 1359.72] alcohol no I can't handle alcohol
[1357.74 - 1361.64] I can handle more than a few drinks I
[1359.72 - 1363.38] can't handle more than a half a drink
[1361.64 - 1365.84] you hear that right
[1363.38 - 1367.16] so I want to talk about this in a minute
[1365.84 - 1369.32] but first I want to make an announcement
[1367.16 - 1370.88] we are in the medical medium while
[1369.32 - 1373.82] blueberry drinks challenge
[1370.88 - 1374.60] we're day one it's a free challenge you
[1373.82 - 1377.00] still have time to go to

[1385.70 - 1390.44] we're going to be making three different
[1387.14 - 1392.60] drinks a wild blueberry apple cider
[1390.44 - 1395.30] a brain detox tonic
[1392.60 - 1396.50] and while blueberry sangria sign up to
[1395.30 - 1398.72] the challenge get your free grocery
[1396.50 - 1401.06] shopping list go to medicalmedium.com
[1398.72 - 1402.86] you'll see the link also in the profile
[1401.06 - 1405.70] and description
[1402.86 - 1405.70] all right you guys
[1406.04 - 1411.68] check this out right you heard someone
[1408.08 - 1412.88] say before I could handle alcohol
[1411.68 - 1415.16] right
[1412.88 - 1417.14] my friend Bryce
[1415.16 - 1418.10] my friend Bryce says he can handle
[1417.14 - 1420.50] alcohol
[1418.10 - 1423.02] like it he can handle a few shots easy
[1420.50 - 1426.14] right then I know people they can't
[1423.02 - 1428.42] handle alcohol on any level
[1426.14 - 1431.54] there's a reason for that
[1428.42 - 1433.88] it's Whoever has the stronger liver
[1431.54 - 1437.42] can handle alcohol
[1433.88 - 1440.66] longer or more larger amounts of alcohol
[1437.42 - 1443.72] if someone has a weaker liver stagnant
[1440.66 - 1446.72] sluggish problematic
[1443.72 - 1448.34] that's another story that means we got a
[1446.72 - 1449.60] liver that can't handle alcohol but
[1448.34 - 1451.58] there's a reason for it because that
[1449.60 - 1454.64] liver is dense that liver is hardened
[1451.58 - 1456.92] the liver stagnant sluggish
[1454.64 - 1459.02] it's also why as people age they can't
[1456.92 - 1461.00] handle alcohol as much either well you
[1459.02 - 1463.40] know in my college Years
[1461.00 - 1465.44] I could just totally get shit-faced in
[1463.40 - 1467.18] my college years and just whatever I
[1465.44 - 1468.74] could drink drink drink I could put a
[1467.18 - 1470.90] tube down my throat somebody could be
[1468.74 - 1474.26] standing on the bar and dumping down
[1470.90 - 1476.24] like gallons of alcohol
[1474.26 - 1477.62] but then their liver gets stagnant and
[1476.24 - 1479.36] sluggish over time and when they get
[1477.62 - 1481.22] older they're like I can't handle that
[1479.36 - 1483.08] much no no that's good she can stop
[1481.22 - 1485.78] pouring it from there well I could just
[1483.08 - 1488.00] have one shot you hear that right
[1485.78 - 1489.62] so I'm back to the book I'm on page 159
[1488.00 - 1491.30] a brain saver I'm reading right out of
[1489.62 - 1494.24] the book now this is unique information
[1491.30 - 1496.22] by the way about how alcohol destroys
[1494.24 - 1497.78] the brain how it works science and
[1496.22 - 1500.42] research does not know they don't know
[1497.78 - 1502.34] what happens when you drink where that
[1500.42 - 1504.38] alcohol how it goes to the brain and
[1502.34 - 1505.40] what happens inside the brain they have
[1504.38 - 1508.16] no idea
[1505.40 - 1511.54] but they will now because this
[1508.16 - 1511.54] information is getting out there
[1512.48 - 1515.54] that's why some say I can't handle
[1514.46 - 1519.02] alcohol
[1515.54 - 1521.00] or he can't handle his liquor
[1519.02 - 1524.48] because their livers are weakened
[1521.00 - 1526.04] especially as they age
[1524.48 - 1528.56] regardless if someone's alcohol
[1526.04 - 1533.02] tolerance when enough alcohol is
[1528.56 - 1533.02] consumed the effects are all the same
[1533.60 - 1536.84] that point right there is mind-blowing
[1535.40 - 1539.42] regardless of someone's alcohol
[1536.84 - 1543.20] tolerance
[1539.42 - 1545.42] right besides that when regardless of
[1543.20 - 1548.24] that when enough alcohol is consumed for
[1545.42 - 1550.34] anybody any individual whether they can
[1548.24 - 1553.04] handle their liquor or not
[1550.34 - 1555.80] the effects are all the same as you're
[1553.04 - 1557.48] drinking alcohol it starts to poison and
[1555.80 - 1559.76] numb the liver
[1557.48 - 1562.40] so the first thing is they say right so
[1559.76 - 1565.22] you heard science say this well you
[1562.40 - 1568.00] drink too much you hurt your liver that
[1565.22 - 1568.00] part is known
[1568.28 - 1572.00] so as you're drinking alcohol it starts
[1570.32 - 1574.46] to poison and numb the liver but what
[1572.00 - 1575.48] they don't know is it starts to numb the
[1574.46 - 1577.76] liver
[1575.48 - 1580.10] they don't know what it does to the
[1577.76 - 1582.44] liver they don't understand what happens
[1580.10 - 1584.72] to the liver so science research doesn't
[1582.44 - 1587.36] know what happens to the liver when you
[1584.72 - 1589.64] drink they just guesstimate that a
[1587.36 - 1592.16] person lifelong drinking
[1589.64 - 1594.38] gets cirrhosis of the liver but that's
[1592.16 - 1596.18] not even totally accurate I've known
[1594.38 - 1598.10] people that do lifelong drinking and
[1596.18 - 1600.56] don't have cirrhosis of the liver see
[1598.10 - 1602.48] they don't even know that
[1600.56 - 1604.46] as you're drinking alcohol it starts to
[1602.48 - 1606.80] poison and numb the liver and your liver
[1604.46 - 1608.48] is your defense mechanism to stop
[1606.80 - 1611.18] alcohol from getting to your brain that
[1608.48 - 1613.22] part they don't know
[1611.18 - 1615.32] so science and research does not know
[1613.22 - 1617.30] that your liver is your defense
[1615.32 - 1619.52] mechanism to stop alcohol from getting
[1617.30 - 1620.90] to the brain they don't have that
[1619.52 - 1623.96] information
[1620.90 - 1626.00] it is your line of defense to stop the
[1623.96 - 1629.92] poison from getting here
[1626.00 - 1629.92] that's what your liver is
[1630.44 - 1634.52] by the time you start getting tipsy or
[1633.32 - 1636.44] whatever you personally call the
[1634.52 - 1637.82] beginning stages of feeling alcohol's
[1636.44 - 1639.50] effects because everybody has a
[1637.82 - 1641.48] different term somebody might say I'm
[1639.50 - 1643.22] tipsy someone might say I'm starting to
[1641.48 - 1644.90] loosen up someone might say I'm starting
[1643.22 - 1647.96] to get drunk everybody has a different
[1644.90 - 1650.48] terminology when they're drinking
[1647.96 - 1653.30] no matter how mild your liver is already
[1650.48 - 1656.36] at its saturation level for protecting
[1653.30 - 1658.58] your brain so that is something medical
[1656.36 - 1660.86] research and science has no idea about I
[1658.58 - 1663.32] know this is going to get poached the
[1660.86 - 1666.86] minute you start feeling whatever you
[1663.32 - 1669.14] call that name Tipsy or feeling a little
[1666.86 - 1671.48] drunk or feelings like loosening up
[1669.14 - 1672.86] whatever the term is that you use when
[1671.48 - 1675.02] you're drinking
[1672.86 - 1680.00] that means
[1675.02 - 1681.56] your liver is at its level it's at its
[1680.00 - 1683.60] Tipping Point
[1681.56 - 1685.16] so keep that in mind so it could be
[1683.60 - 1687.26] anybody that's just like oh I'm getting
[1685.16 - 1689.48] a little tipsy
[1687.26 - 1691.82] oh I'm kidding I'm feeling a little kind
[1689.48 - 1694.58] of you know loose now I'm feeling like
[1691.82 - 1697.70] okay I can you know speak my mind
[1694.58 - 1699.80] whatever it is that you feel
[1697.70 - 1701.60] so whatever you personally call the
[1699.80 - 1703.70] beginning stages of feeling alcohol's
[1701.60 - 1705.50] effects no matter how mild your liver is
[1703.70 - 1707.60] already at its saturation level for
[1705.50 - 1709.70] protecting the brain so that means your
[1707.60 - 1712.10] liver
[1709.70 - 1713.42] can't protect your brain anymore you
[1712.10 - 1716.24] bypassed it
[1713.42 - 1718.82] and that right there
[1716.24 - 1721.40] is incredible information from above
[1718.82 - 1723.20] Nobody Knows the minute you feel that
[1721.40 - 1726.82] sensation
[1723.20 - 1726.82] you already bypass
[1727.82 - 1734.12] your liver's defense mechanisms
[1731.66 - 1736.40] that's what occurred
[1734.12 - 1739.10] when we talk about moderation with
[1736.40 - 1741.02] alcohol we miss the crucial point
[1739.10 - 1744.20] I know you guys people are people have
[1741.02 - 1745.40] been slamming moderation at me again I
[1744.20 - 1747.38] noticed some of the haters out there
[1745.40 - 1749.90] they'll use that one they'd be like well
[1747.38 - 1751.34] I think moderation is just a healthy way
[1749.90 - 1753.50] of doing things tell that to a
[1751.34 - 1756.92] chronically ill person
[1753.50 - 1759.44] who literally can't heal because they're
[1756.92 - 1761.72] letting the whole moderation right
[1759.44 - 1764.00] gaslighting the moderation gas lighting
[1761.72 - 1766.16] take over and then they're stuck in the
[1764.00 - 1768.74] moderation game and then they're afraid
[1766.16 - 1770.54] to do the right things to heal because
[1768.74 - 1772.22] they're thinking they have to be in
[1770.54 - 1774.50] moderation like that's a healthier
[1772.22 - 1777.80] Pursuit
[1774.50 - 1779.90] alcohol is toxic in any amount so the
[1777.80 - 1782.12] liver's job is to soak up every last
[1779.90 - 1784.28] drop it can when your liver is being
[1782.12 - 1787.24] poisoned by alcohol it can't release
[1784.28 - 1787.24] glucose anymore
[1787.52 - 1791.60] that's something to know right there
[1789.80 - 1794.36] remember I was telling you guys earlier
[1791.60 - 1796.54] reading out the book here brain saver
[1794.36 - 1798.80] the minute
[1796.54 - 1801.26] your liver
[1798.80 - 1803.12] starts to get that that alcohol
[1801.26 - 1804.68] poisoning it can't release that glucose
[1803.12 - 1806.12] anymore
[1804.68 - 1808.76] because the liver's job a healthy
[1806.12 - 1810.02] liver's job or even a liver that's
[1808.76 - 1811.76] actually stagnant sluggish and
[1810.02 - 1814.52] problematic
[1811.76 - 1817.52] the liver's job is to release glucose to
[1814.52 - 1819.74] your brain so your brain uses glucose
[1817.52 - 1822.50] that comes from your liver
[1819.74 - 1825.32] but the minute your liver is being
[1822.50 - 1827.66] saturated by alcohol and you hit that
[1825.32 - 1829.88] saturation point the liver cannot
[1827.66 - 1832.10] release glucose to your brain anymore so
[1829.88 - 1835.12] when someone's drinking no more glucose
[1832.10 - 1835.12] gets to the brain anymore
[1836.06 - 1839.36] I want to show you the book right here
[1837.50 - 1840.80] guys by the way because someone is
[1839.36 - 1842.42] asking they're saying show the book
[1840.80 - 1843.98] cover
[1842.42 - 1846.86] that's the book cover
[1843.98 - 1849.68] right there it's brain saver and brain
[1846.86 - 1850.94] saver protocol so make sure you get both
[1849.68 - 1852.68] books
[1850.94 - 1855.32] right
[1852.68 - 1857.24] Luke Roger says mm info took me out of
[1855.32 - 1859.54] suffering appreciate you aw appreciate
[1857.24 - 1859.54] you too
[1862.34 - 1865.82] so we're taught you guys let's just
[1864.02 - 1867.38] let's just uh talk about this we're
[1865.82 - 1869.24] making three drinks pretty soon hang in
[1867.38 - 1871.70] there I'm reading straight out of brain
[1869.24 - 1873.62] saver we're talking about the topic how
[1871.70 - 1875.36] alcohol destroys the brain
[1873.62 - 1877.28] we're talking about how it does we're
[1875.36 - 1879.44] going into incredible unique original
[1877.28 - 1881.06] information from above about how alcohol
[1879.44 - 1881.96] has effects on the brain and how it
[1881.06 - 1883.58] works
[1881.96 - 1885.02] so we're doing that we're also making
[1883.58 - 1886.04] three drinks pretty soon so hang in
[1885.02 - 1887.42] there we're making a wild blueberry
[1886.04 - 1889.52] apple cider which is actually really
[1887.42 - 1891.86] cool one of my favorites by the way
[1889.52 - 1893.12] some pumped up about that
[1891.86 - 1895.36] but we're going to read a little bit
[1893.12 - 1895.36] more
[1895.64 - 1900.08] even if someone has a large storage bin
[1897.98 - 1902.96] of glucose eventually the liver becomes
[1900.08 - 1905.36] Paralyzed by the by the alcohol
[1902.96 - 1907.76] in this vitally important function so
[1905.36 - 1910.16] you can be a dude
[1907.76 - 1912.50] you can be somebody it's got a strong
[1910.16 - 1915.50] liver you're young you got a liver
[1912.50 - 1918.14] that's not oversaturated
[1915.50 - 1920.12] and you could be drinking and the minute
[1918.14 - 1922.46] you hit that point where you start
[1920.12 - 1924.74] feeling the effects of the alcohol do
[1922.46 - 1927.38] something for your body that means your
[1924.74 - 1929.60] liver is at its saturation point now for
[1927.38 - 1931.70] one dude that could be like 10 shots of
[1929.60 - 1933.50] whiskey for someone else it could be a
[1931.70 - 1936.14] sip of whiskey but the point is is
[1933.50 - 1938.66] that's when the liver stops
[1936.14 - 1940.52] feeding the brain and releasing glucose
[1938.66 - 1942.38] to the brain
[1940.52 - 1945.32] because the liver's job of releasing
[1942.38 - 1947.72] glucose is halted it stopped its job
[1945.32 - 1949.34] instead becomes soaking up alcohol so
[1947.72 - 1951.20] here's how it goes
[1949.34 - 1953.24] the liver's there to protect your brain
[1951.20 - 1955.22] the more we drink
[1953.24 - 1957.14] the liver is trying to stop that alcohol
[1955.22 - 1958.94] from getting to the brain it can't
[1957.14 - 1961.64] release glucose anymore to your brain
[1958.94 - 1963.80] because it has to quit all its jobs it
[1961.64 - 1966.80] has to stop working and it has to now be
[1963.80 - 1968.30] just a sponge for the alcohol
[1966.80 - 1971.48] here's the question right here I like
[1968.30 - 1973.52] his recipes and some of the stuff he has
[1971.48 - 1975.62] but saying that professionals don't know
[1973.52 - 1977.54] about the liver and alcohol poisoning
[1975.62 - 1980.06] and acting like the frontier of science
[1977.54 - 1982.16] with no scientific findings very
[1980.06 - 1983.06] interesting okay well that's kind of
[1982.16 - 1986.78] funny
[1983.06 - 1988.82] because I published how the cause of
[1986.78 - 1991.88] multiple sclerosis is Epstein-Barr virus
[1988.82 - 1994.84] but I published it also in details so
[1991.88 - 1994.84] listen to this
[1995.48 - 2000.46] almost eight years later Harvard took
[1997.58 - 2002.26] that information and put it out there as
[2000.46 - 2003.82] if they discovered it when it was
[2002.26 - 2006.22] already published
[2003.82 - 2008.20] and in New York Times best-selling book
[2006.22 - 2010.84] and millions of those copies went around
[2008.20 - 2014.02] the world and it became the number one
[2010.84 - 2016.60] health book in the world so I got no
[2014.02 - 2019.24] credibility you're saying when literally
[2016.60 - 2020.80] science is poaching information which is
[2019.24 - 2022.48] illegal
[2020.80 - 2025.30] illegal
[2022.48 - 2026.80] that's what legal tells me
[2025.30 - 2029.86] and they're poaching that information
[2026.80 - 2032.62] for their big universities out of little
[2029.86 - 2034.36] old me a guy who knows nothing
[2032.62 - 2037.18] out of his books that are best-selling
[2034.36 - 2040.30] books New York Times bestselling books
[2037.18 - 2041.68] and how about this one the true cause of
[2040.30 - 2044.92] long covet
[2041.68 - 2046.30] is reactivated Epstein-Barr another one
[2044.92 - 2048.16] two
[2046.30 - 2049.06] and that comes out of all this right
[2048.16 - 2050.86] here
[2049.06 - 2053.14] this book
[2050.86 - 2055.18] so why is science taking all my
[2053.14 - 2056.02] information because I published that
[2055.18 - 2059.14] first
[2056.02 - 2061.12] that long-haul covid is reactivated fcmr
[2059.14 - 2062.92] why is science taking my information if
[2061.12 - 2065.38] I have no credibility
[2062.92 - 2068.14] why are they using all my info and how
[2065.38 - 2070.36] about this why is alternative medicine
[2068.14 - 2072.52] stealing all of the medical media book
[2070.36 - 2074.02] information too those are just a couple
[2072.52 - 2075.84] of examples
[2074.02 - 2078.64] so before you say something like that
[2075.84 - 2080.38] kind of like learn about this and learn
[2078.64 - 2083.44] about the medical medium history right
[2080.38 - 2084.34] read the books learn find out what's out
[2083.44 - 2086.50] there
[2084.34 - 2088.42] so think about that right there so yes
[2086.50 - 2090.28] this is original unique information that
[2088.42 - 2091.84] comes from above it gets published in
[2090.28 - 2094.66] the medical medium books first and then
[2091.84 - 2096.28] poached later and yes I'm sorry but
[2094.66 - 2098.02] medical research and science doesn't
[2096.28 - 2099.88] know what happens to the brain with
[2098.02 - 2102.76] alcohol they still don't know
[2099.88 - 2105.28] doctors even drink and they don't know
[2102.76 - 2106.60] why they get tipsy or drunk and they
[2105.28 - 2110.92] don't know what happens to the brain
[2106.60 - 2112.60] while they're drinking so yeah sorry
[2110.92 - 2115.00] but I really like the question though
[2112.60 - 2116.68] because it it's great because it helps
[2115.00 - 2118.12] me plug the fact that science is always
[2116.68 - 2120.40] stealing all medical meaning books and
[2118.12 - 2122.80] information so that's kind of cool all
[2120.40 - 2125.08] right check this out
[2122.80 - 2126.72] here's a cool part right here and I'm
[2125.08 - 2129.70] glad you love medical medium information
[2126.72 - 2132.10] because that was part of your comment I
[2129.70 - 2134.26] love this info but
[2132.10 - 2138.46] all right that's what people do now too
[2134.26 - 2140.80] it's like I love I love his info uh but
[2138.46 - 2142.78] um yeah that's what they do like you see
[2140.80 - 2145.24] it every day now
[2142.78 - 2147.94] I bet you love the info because heck
[2145.24 - 2149.86] it's saved a lot of lives
[2147.94 - 2151.18] all right let's go into it man because
[2149.86 - 2153.82] we got a little bit more and then we're
[2151.18 - 2155.86] gonna make some drinks okay ready at the
[2153.82 - 2158.56] same time at the same time alcohol
[2155.86 - 2160.48] pushes aside any glucose that is in the
[2158.56 - 2163.36] bloodstream so alcohol becomes the
[2160.48 - 2165.52] brain's number one choice for fuel
[2163.36 - 2167.74] and you can you please tell me where
[2165.52 - 2170.14] that is in science research
[2167.74 - 2171.40] [ __ ] can you find that somewhere that
[2170.14 - 2174.22] alcohol
[2171.40 - 2176.92] actually pushes glucose out of the
[2174.22 - 2178.60] bloodstream and then alcohol itself
[2176.92 - 2179.98] becomes the brain's number one form of
[2178.60 - 2182.02] glucose
[2179.98 - 2183.76] meaning fuel can you tell me where that
[2182.02 - 2186.34] is is that in a research paper somewhere
[2183.76 - 2188.32] no but it will be in five years and I'll
[2186.34 - 2191.98] be proven right
[2188.32 - 2193.90] because alcohol seems like glucose even
[2191.98 - 2196.30] though in the end it isn't so remember I
[2193.90 - 2198.70] was telling you alcohol is the ghost of
[2196.30 - 2200.62] sugar your brain gets tricked out and
[2198.70 - 2202.96] believes that alcohol is actually
[2200.62 - 2204.94] glucose a fuel
[2202.96 - 2207.22] the more alcohol you put in your
[2204.94 - 2209.38] bloodstream the more your brain
[2207.22 - 2212.50] identifies
[2209.38 - 2214.24] the alcohol instead of glucose and
[2212.50 - 2215.62] here's another problem when you get
[2214.24 - 2217.72] alcohol in your bloodstream and this is
[2215.62 - 2219.34] unknown to research in science when you
[2217.72 - 2221.44] get alcohol in your bloodstream it
[2219.34 - 2224.74] pushes glucose out
[2221.44 - 2227.32] it pushes glucose away from the brain
[2224.74 - 2230.08] your brain can only identify that
[2227.32 - 2232.18] alcohol down
[2230.08 - 2234.88] you guys I want to ask you guys a
[2232.18 - 2237.22] question can you just be frank with me
[2234.88 - 2239.62] and can you just be like open with me on
[2237.22 - 2241.60] this okay I'm just sidetracked right now
[2239.62 - 2246.22] completely
[2241.60 - 2248.74] if the information from these incredible
[2246.22 - 2251.26] eight books in the medical medium book
[2248.74 - 2252.88] series is original and unique
[2251.26 - 2254.56] and most of you guys know that because
[2252.88 - 2255.70] you've been there and done that and did
[2254.56 - 2257.80] everything
[2255.70 - 2259.18] am I supposed to hide that and never say
[2257.80 - 2262.84] that
[2259.18 - 2265.18] like am I supposed to pretend that I got
[2262.84 - 2267.70] all this information in these volumes of
[2265.18 - 2269.38] books from some other source like some
[2267.70 - 2270.76] study or something when it doesn't exist
[2269.38 - 2274.30] and there is no study with all this
[2270.76 - 2278.28] information am I supposed to lie and say
[2274.30 - 2278.28] that my information isn't original
[2278.50 - 2284.92] so I can fit in everywhere and not get
[2281.38 - 2286.84] like kicked you know kicked in the back
[2284.92 - 2288.52] I just want you to people okay let me
[2286.84 - 2290.14] just ask you guys this this is just a
[2288.52 - 2291.16] heart to heart I I know what a lot of
[2290.14 - 2292.84] you guys are here for the drinks and I'm
[2291.16 - 2295.06] about to make them but this is a heart
[2292.84 - 2295.84] to heart what would you do please tell
[2295.06 - 2297.94] me
[2295.84 - 2299.56] if you woke up at the age of four one
[2297.94 - 2301.60] morning and you heard a voice and it
[2299.56 - 2303.58] gave you Advanced information
[2301.60 - 2305.68] that has saved
[2303.58 - 2308.26] countless lives you put that information
[2305.68 - 2311.14] in incredible book series
[2308.26 - 2312.52] there's not one eat better book out
[2311.14 - 2314.38] there and this isn't an eat better book
[2312.52 - 2317.02] there's not one healthy book out there
[2314.38 - 2319.18] in the in the alternative genre anywhere
[2317.02 - 2320.20] that has this information and that much
[2319.18 - 2322.30] right
[2320.20 - 2325.54] what would you do would you sit there
[2322.30 - 2326.92] and be afraid to actually say it comes
[2325.54 - 2329.80] from above
[2326.92 - 2331.42] would you be afraid to tell the truth
[2329.80 - 2332.56] that the information is unique and
[2331.42 - 2334.48] original
[2332.56 - 2335.38] and it can't be found anywhere but the
[2334.48 - 2337.06] books
[2335.38 - 2339.46] and you can prove it
[2337.06 - 2340.48] would you lie so you can fit in with
[2339.46 - 2342.34] everybody
[2340.48 - 2344.92] would you lie so you could have
[2342.34 - 2346.30] so-called credibility with everybody I
[2344.92 - 2347.80] want to know what you would do tell me
[2346.30 - 2350.26] what you would do
[2347.80 - 2352.30] because
[2350.26 - 2354.70] because as a humanitarian because that's
[2352.30 - 2356.80] what a humanitarian is someone who saves
[2354.70 - 2358.54] lives right I'm a messenger for Spirit
[2356.80 - 2361.48] of compassion to get the information out
[2358.54 - 2363.82] there and on a humanitarian way
[2361.48 - 2365.74] am I supposed to lie
[2363.82 - 2367.90] I want to know what you would do if you
[2365.74 - 2370.36] had all this original information that's
[2367.90 - 2373.60] never been published anywhere no study
[2370.36 - 2376.24] no science no anything tell me what
[2373.60 - 2378.16] would you do would you lie and say that
[2376.24 - 2379.42] you got it from a research paper when it
[2378.16 - 2381.34] doesn't exist just to make somebody
[2379.42 - 2384.16] happy or would you say it was unique
[2381.34 - 2387.78] original and pure and untouched and it
[2384.16 - 2387.78] comes from above like the truth
[2387.82 - 2393.46] because I still get punished every day
[2390.46 - 2395.46] by somebody saying how dare you say
[2393.46 - 2397.72] that your own information
[2395.46 - 2399.28] is not original or unique and you
[2397.72 - 2401.86] shouldn't be saying that so I would like
[2399.28 - 2404.68] to know what you guys would do would you
[2401.86 - 2406.84] hide it would you live a why would you
[2404.68 - 2408.46] pretend it wasn't coming from above and
[2406.84 - 2410.82] then pretend you got it somewhere where
[2408.46 - 2410.82] you didn't
[2411.22 - 2415.12] all right if you just got here we're day
[2413.56 - 2416.86] one of the medical medium wild blueberry
[2415.12 - 2419.62] drinks challenge we still got something
[2416.86 - 2422.50] to do the amount of hate and attacks I
[2419.62 - 2424.78] get is unreal you guys have no idea
[2422.50 - 2426.64] and a lot of you don't see the amount of
[2424.78 - 2428.86] pushback I get for sharing this
[2426.64 - 2430.78] information so people can heal it's
[2428.86 - 2434.74] unreal
[2430.78 - 2437.44] it's unreal and I could stop tomorrow
[2434.74 - 2439.42] I could literally stop tomorrow
[2437.44 - 2441.76] and just call it quits
[2439.42 - 2443.56] easily and just say I'm done
[2441.76 - 2445.00] but I'm in it for the chronically ill
[2443.56 - 2446.20] and I'm gonna fight fight for The
[2445.00 - 2447.70] Chronic Leo and that's what keeps me
[2446.20 - 2449.68] doing it
[2447.70 - 2451.18] and you know and that's why you guys
[2449.68 - 2452.86] when you share this information and
[2451.18 - 2454.78] everything citing Vector medical means
[2452.86 - 2458.02] important of course all that
[2454.78 - 2460.00] and it's all free I don't charge for it
[2458.02 - 2461.50] am I doing groups and you know and
[2460.00 - 2462.88] charging five thousand dollars for a
[2461.50 - 2465.16] group three thousand dollars for a group
[2462.88 - 2467.26] of people to join in and then give them
[2465.16 - 2470.80] some like packet and a bunch of info and
[2467.26 - 2473.08] right am I doing that no it's free it's
[2470.80 - 2475.24] in the books but I do notice that a lot
[2473.08 - 2476.50] of people don't read the books and they
[2475.24 - 2477.46] did a little celery just for a little
[2476.50 - 2479.74] while
[2477.46 - 2481.90] they tried maybe a little something but
[2479.74 - 2483.88] they didn't read the books and learn and
[2481.90 - 2485.74] then they go join these groups that are
[2483.88 - 2487.72] charging three thousand five thousand
[2485.74 - 2490.06] dollars two thousand dollars they join
[2487.72 - 2492.58] these groups to learn information that's
[2490.06 - 2495.40] not even medical medium it's a hosh posh
[2492.58 - 2497.50] and mishmash of everything else
[2495.40 - 2499.00] it's just so sad
[2497.50 - 2501.70] okay so let's go at the same time
[2499.00 - 2503.74] alcohol pushes aside any glucose that is
[2501.70 - 2505.90] in the bloodstream so alcohol becomes
[2503.74 - 2507.34] the brain's number one choice for fuel
[2505.90 - 2509.74] so this is really important right here
[2507.34 - 2511.90] because alcohol seems like glucose even
[2509.74 - 2515.14] though in the end it isn't so here's how
[2511.90 - 2517.84] it works alcohol when you drink it
[2515.14 - 2520.90] seems like glucose to the brain but it
[2517.84 - 2523.06] isn't but yet the brain only chooses
[2520.90 - 2524.92] that glucose when it's saturated in the
[2523.06 - 2527.50] bloodstream because alcohol pushes all
[2524.92 - 2530.38] glucose away including numbing up the
[2527.50 - 2533.92] liver shutting it down so it can't
[2530.38 - 2537.40] actually release glucose alcohol is a
[2533.92 - 2541.48] byproduct of glucose it's a byproduct of
[2537.40 - 2544.84] sugar it's a ghost of what sugar was
[2541.48 - 2547.24] so the brain becomes a victim of the
[2544.84 - 2548.44] ghost effect of alcohol so when you see
[2547.24 - 2552.34] somebody drinking and they're getting
[2548.44 - 2556.18] tipsy their brain becomes a victim to
[2552.34 - 2558.22] the ghost effect of what was alcohol
[2556.18 - 2559.72] that piece of information when I got
[2558.22 - 2561.64] that from Spirit compassion I was just
[2559.72 - 2563.62] like blown away because how crazy is
[2561.64 - 2566.56] that
[2563.62 - 2570.72] it's a ghost of what sugar was
[2566.56 - 2570.72] it's mind-blowing information
[2571.30 - 2577.00] so the brain becomes a victim of the
[2573.82 - 2579.58] ghost effect of alcohol
[2577.00 - 2582.94] that's what happens as more alcohol
[2579.58 - 2584.08] enters the brain a person exhibits more
[2582.94 - 2586.06] drunken
[2584.08 - 2589.54] that is
[2586.06 - 2592.42] Behavior when someone gets to the point
[2589.54 - 2595.18] of drunken Behavior slurred speech
[2592.42 - 2597.16] inability to function normally that
[2595.18 - 2598.96] means the brain is already starting to
[2597.16 - 2600.46] starve to death
[2598.96 - 2603.04] check this out
[2600.46 - 2605.38] this is how mind-blowing this is
[2603.04 - 2608.56] when you're at the point of slurring
[2605.38 - 2611.80] your speech when drinking
[2608.56 - 2613.90] your brain is already starting to starve
[2611.80 - 2616.48] to death so what you're witnessing from
[2613.90 - 2618.64] the person is a person's brain starving
[2616.48 - 2620.20] to death so if you're hanging out with a
[2618.64 - 2621.46] bunch of friends and people are slurring
[2620.20 - 2624.34] their speech because they're drinking
[2621.46 - 2625.78] what you're witnessing is their brain is
[2624.34 - 2628.42] starving to death
[2625.78 - 2630.88] it's dying
[2628.42 - 2632.68] it's actually dying if you have a party
[2630.88 - 2635.26] filled with people that are drunk or
[2632.68 - 2636.94] getting drunk what you're seeing with
[2635.26 - 2638.44] them walking around and kind of like
[2636.94 - 2640.06] walking around like this and slurring
[2638.44 - 2641.80] your speech what you're seeing is their
[2640.06 - 2647.22] brains are actually dying they're
[2641.80 - 2647.22] starving to death how insane is that
[2647.62 - 2652.24] and here's a key understanding most of
[2650.80 - 2654.40] the symptoms we associate with
[2652.24 - 2656.56] drunkenness and alcohol poisoning are
[2654.40 - 2659.08] only from alcohol itself
[2656.56 - 2661.48] most are symptoms of the brain starting
[2659.08 - 2665.14] to die
[2661.48 - 2667.36] you guys when someone is experiencing a
[2665.14 - 2670.54] symptom of drunkenness
[2667.36 - 2673.38] what it is it's a symptom of the brain
[2670.54 - 2673.38] starting to die
[2675.00 - 2678.94] unbelievable anyway you guys we're day
[2677.92 - 2680.38] one to Medical mean and while
[2678.94 - 2681.58] blueberries challenge we're gonna make
[2680.38 - 2683.62] three drinks
[2681.58 - 2685.84] Deborah says this information is
[2683.62 - 2688.06] mind-blowing the more alcohol you
[2685.84 - 2690.46] consume in an evening or day the less
[2688.06 - 2693.58] glucose the brain absorbs and then fuels
[2690.46 - 2696.22] itself with if we think of the Optimum
[2693.58 - 2698.26] as 100 of glucose entering the brain and
[2696.22 - 2700.54] keeping it alive then drinking alcohol
[2698.26 - 2702.10] brings that glucose performance down to
[2700.54 - 2707.44] five or ten percent
[2702.10 - 2709.30] depending on how drunken someone is
[2707.44 - 2711.04] that means that we're supposed to be
[2709.30 - 2713.32] getting a hundred percent glucose
[2711.04 - 2715.18] Optimum levels of glucose to the brain
[2713.32 - 2716.56] on a daily level when you're drinking
[2715.18 - 2718.96] and getting drunk you're only getting
[2716.56 - 2720.70] five to ten percent levels of glucose to
[2718.96 - 2722.88] the brain as your brain is starving to
[2720.70 - 2722.88] death
[2723.28 - 2728.98] it's like taking a fish out of water
[2725.32 - 2731.80] watching it gasp for air on the beach as
[2728.98 - 2733.54] it takes in oxygen instead of water then
[2731.80 - 2735.10] putting it back in the water to revive
[2733.54 - 2736.54] it and then taking it back out that's
[2735.10 - 2739.12] like putting a fish
[2736.54 - 2743.26] on the land or pulling it out of a tank
[2739.12 - 2745.72] watching it gasp as its brain starts to
[2743.26 - 2748.36] die and then dropping the fish back into
[2745.72 - 2750.10] the water and letting the brain revive
[2748.36 - 2752.44] then pulling the fish back out of the
[2750.10 - 2754.30] water and watching it gasp for air and
[2752.44 - 2757.26] then dropping it back in the tank and
[2754.30 - 2757.26] watching it revive
[2758.02 - 2762.28] the fish will stay alive although it
[2760.48 - 2764.80] pays the price for being thrust into
[2762.28 - 2767.38] survival mode this is what happens when
[2764.80 - 2769.36] someone drinks alcohol regularly just
[2767.38 - 2772.00] enough glucose is getting to the brain
[2769.36 - 2773.80] to keep the person alive yet it's so
[2772.00 - 2776.38] little that the person loses the ability
[2773.80 - 2779.32] to function because they're drunk you
[2776.38 - 2782.22] become a walking talking example of a
[2779.32 - 2782.22] Dying brain
[2784.66 - 2789.28] alcohol dominates our over glucose
[2787.30 - 2792.10] getting to the brain because not only is
[2789.28 - 2793.84] the liver intoxicated paralyzed and
[2792.10 - 2795.88] cannot release enough glucose to get to
[2793.84 - 2797.92] the brain but the brain chooses alcohol
[2795.88 - 2799.72] over glucose
[2797.92 - 2801.76] this is not because the brain needs
[2799.72 - 2803.32] alcohol or because alcohol is good for
[2801.76 - 2805.42] the brain again it's because the brain
[2803.32 - 2807.46] is being tricked into thinking the
[2805.42 - 2809.14] alcohol is the most accessible viable
[2807.46 - 2811.56] form of glucose I want to make some
[2809.14 - 2814.50] drinks you guys
[2811.56 - 2816.64] just blows my mind the information
[2814.50 - 2819.40] I can't even tell you so we're making
[2816.64 - 2822.04] the brain detox challenge so that's
[2819.40 - 2824.08] actually next not challenge brain detox
[2822.04 - 2826.00] is what we're making all right so it's a
[2824.08 - 2827.92] tonic so I'm excited you guys then we're
[2826.00 - 2830.02] making a wild blueberry apple cider and
[2827.92 - 2832.12] we're making also why blueberry sangria
[2830.02 - 2835.66] so I'm excited okay so it's on three
[2832.12 - 2838.20] page 320 on protocols let's do the brain
[2835.66 - 2841.60] detox tonic
[2838.20 - 2843.72] right here so if you got your protocols
[2841.60 - 2843.72] book
[2844.00 - 2847.90] okay page 320 and there's the recipe
[2846.76 - 2849.52] right there
[2847.90 - 2852.04] guys check it out
[2849.52 - 2853.54] really pumped up about this
[2852.04 - 2855.34] to put the book over here for a second
[2853.54 - 2857.38] let's get going
[2855.34 - 2858.76] so
[2857.38 - 2861.46] that's right here

[3168.06 - 3171.06] nice
[3171.84 - 3175.94] I'm gonna throw a cinnamon stick in
[3173.70 - 3175.94] there
[3177.60 - 3181.38] voila
[3179.04 - 3182.88] I'm gonna turn up the temp I had it warm
[3181.38 - 3184.26] it was already kind of like you know
[3182.88 - 3186.90] going a little bit so I just turned up
[3184.26 - 3188.82] temperature more I'm gonna put three
[3186.90 - 3191.46] cardamon
[3188.82 - 3193.02] pods in here
[3191.46 - 3194.58] it's one
[3193.02 - 3196.68] two
[3194.58 - 3198.00] three that's whole cardamom right there
[3196.68 - 3201.18] well you guys I'll show you on the
[3198.00 - 3203.88] close-up too that's awesome Yep
[3201.18 - 3206.28] see these are whole cardamoms right here
[3203.88 - 3208.44] check it out those are strong by the way
[3206.28 - 3210.36] they're really strong I put three right
[3208.44 - 3213.00] in there because believe it or not
[3210.36 - 3216.26] it's got a kick to it
[3213.00 - 3216.26] one star anise
[3216.66 - 3220.32] so there we go
[3218.22 - 3223.14] there's the spiders these are the
[3220.32 - 3226.14] dehydrated spiders right
[3223.14 - 3229.08] they got a kick that's going in and
[3226.14 - 3232.82] let's see four or five cloves
[3229.08 - 3232.82] ah we got some cloves right here
[3233.22 - 3236.84] four or five of them is good
[3238.92 - 3245.12] boom
[3240.66 - 3245.12] half inch piece of Ginger let's actually
[3245.16 - 3249.02] get a paring knife out really quick
[3251.04 - 3254.64] you can peel it
[3252.90 - 3256.92] if you don't want to peel it you don't
[3254.64 - 3259.86] have to if you don't want to I like to
[3256.92 - 3261.30] peel it thinly slice it
[3259.86 - 3263.28] one of the reasons why you want to peel
[3261.30 - 3264.78] it too is just you know because if you
[3263.28 - 3266.46] have company over and everything and
[3264.78 - 3268.50] someone gets a peel in their mouth and
[3266.46 - 3270.00] they're just like I mean some some of
[3268.50 - 3271.68] the ginger skin in their mouth that's
[3270.00 - 3273.60] not as fun
[3271.68 - 3274.86] I've seen that happen so I was like all
[3273.60 - 3276.48] right all right let me just peel this
[3274.86 - 3279.62] back
[3276.48 - 3279.62] thinly slice it
[3280.14 - 3282.86] there we go
[3290.40 - 3294.90] that's going in see these pieces you
[3292.98 - 3297.56] guys
[3294.90 - 3297.56] incredible
[3297.72 - 3300.90] simmer for 10 to 15 minutes let it get
[3299.82 - 3301.80] simmering for a little bit I'm gonna
[3300.90 - 3304.50] move
[3301.80 - 3307.22] some of this around
[3304.50 - 3307.22] nice
[3311.28 - 3315.60] all right so we're gonna make a wild
[3313.26 - 3317.34] blueberry orange sangria if you guys
[3315.60 - 3319.02] just got here this is day one of the
[3317.34 - 3321.06] medical medium wild blueberry drinks

[3321.06 - 3325.70] okay
[3322.38 - 3325.70] so we're gonna make the sangria
[3331.32 - 3338.90] looking around for Stuff
[3334.88 - 3338.90] we're going to need this too
[3339.48 - 3345.36] all right I love drinks
[3343.62 - 3347.28] so I got the picture right here so I'm
[3345.36 - 3348.96] going to use this so I'm actually going
[3347.28 - 3350.70] to start out with making simple let's
[3348.96 - 3352.62] let's just start by putting in three
[3350.70 - 3354.30] cups of wild blueberry juice in there
[3352.62 - 3357.42] actually I'll hold off for that for the
[3354.30 - 3359.52] moment let me start with
[3357.42 - 3360.38] no no I'll do that I think it's a good
[3359.52 - 3364.58] idea
[3360.38 - 3364.58] all right so we're gonna do three cups
[3365.82 - 3370.40] you guys we're making these fast this is
[3367.68 - 3370.40] like insane
[3370.68 - 3375.38] like seriously we're making them pretty
[3372.66 - 3375.38] quick right or
[3376.92 - 3380.12] three cups right there
[3381.66 - 3384.44] nice
[3391.08 - 3394.28] I still need a shot
[3396.48 - 3399.44] you guys don't mind right
[3401.88 - 3405.74] bartender give me another
[3405.78 - 3408.50] all right
[3411.54 - 3415.74] if there's a feeling you get it's
[3414.18 - 3417.86] different than like with alcohol
[3415.74 - 3420.36] poisoning right or alcoholic beverage
[3417.86 - 3421.92] beverages right the more I slurring my
[3420.36 - 3423.66] speech because I'm getting glucose to
[3421.92 - 3424.80] the brain instead no it doesn't work
[3423.66 - 3427.08] that way I'm not learning my speech
[3424.80 - 3429.54] here's how it works
[3427.08 - 3432.12] when you get like real glucose like a
[3429.54 - 3433.86] high quality glucose something like this
[3432.12 - 3436.38] to the brain that has all that
[3433.86 - 3437.82] anthocyanin in it it's an entirely
[3436.38 - 3439.56] different experience
[3437.82 - 3441.90] and it's it's incredible you know a
[3439.56 - 3444.78] friend of mine who drank his whole life
[3441.90 - 3446.10] I finally got him to quit right doesn't
[3444.78 - 3448.92] drink anymore he's doing the wild
[3446.10 - 3451.74] blueberry juice and he says it's like he
[3448.92 - 3453.84] feels an entirely different Rush
[3451.74 - 3455.40] but he you know he does it that he gets
[3453.84 - 3457.14] on his treadmill and he's running on his
[3455.40 - 3458.76] treadmill he's running on the wild
[3457.14 - 3460.14] blueberry juice the wild blueberry juice
[3458.76 - 3462.42] is getting to the brain the glucose the
[3460.14 - 3463.92] whole bit I tell him it's anthocyanins
[3462.42 - 3465.24] that are actually in the glucose from
[3463.92 - 3466.68] the wobble regions that are getting to
[3465.24 - 3468.72] the brain it's a really incredible
[3466.68 - 3471.54] feeling all right let's go
[3468.72 - 3473.10] all right I'm going to pour this in here
[3471.54 - 3476.06] if you guys don't mind
[3473.10 - 3476.06] just made a mess
[3476.28 - 3479.12] but that's okay
[3482.04 - 3487.62] AWS Bar and Grill gets a little messy
[3485.04 - 3490.74] you guys we are not closing down AWS Bar
[3487.62 - 3492.78] and Grill no way
[3490.74 - 3494.58] only spilled a little bit
[3492.78 - 3496.80] that's why I like the whole live thing
[3494.58 - 3498.78] too because it's like
[3496.80 - 3501.48] I don't know I don't like all that
[3498.78 - 3503.04] pre-recorded stuff where they edit out
[3501.48 - 3504.54] everything because they want the person
[3503.04 - 3506.16] to look perfect they want everything to
[3504.54 - 3507.96] be perfect I don't like that I think
[3506.16 - 3508.74] there's something wrong with that all
[3507.96 - 3510.30] right
[3508.74 - 3513.60] now I'm going to start doing some
[3510.30 - 3514.50] oranges I want to actually
[3513.60 - 3516.06] um
[3514.50 - 3518.82] we're gonna get some orange juice going
[3516.06 - 3521.04] here so what I'm gonna do is squeeze
[3518.82 - 3522.60] a bunch of oranges here so just give me
[3521.04 - 3524.16] a sec
[3522.60 - 3526.44] I want two and a half cups of orange
[3524.16 - 3529.70] juice that's what I want so I'm going to
[3526.44 - 3529.70] slice a whole bunch of oranges
[3529.80 - 3532.80] if you guys don't mind
[3531.24 - 3535.08] right
[3532.80 - 3537.60] I'm gonna hand squeeze them you can use
[3535.08 - 3539.46] uh you know citrus juicer if you want
[3537.60 - 3541.98] I'm going to do just a little bit of
[3539.46 - 3545.54] squeezing this way
[3541.98 - 3545.54] I'm going to cut a few oranges
[3547.26 - 3550.86] you guys don't mind
[3549.48 - 3552.72] you know when I think about that
[3550.86 - 3554.04] information about what alcohol does to
[3552.72 - 3556.38] the brain
[3554.04 - 3559.82] and it's starving the brain to death so
[3556.38 - 3559.82] that when you actually have
[3560.22 - 3566.64] when you actually have symptoms I call
[3563.04 - 3569.22] them symptoms when someone's feeling
[3566.64 - 3571.14] Tipsy it's a symptom it's not just
[3569.22 - 3573.66] because it's a fun thing and it's
[3571.14 - 3575.64] alcohol sure it might feel fun but it's
[3573.66 - 3577.38] a starting of a symptom because their
[3575.64 - 3580.02] brain is being starved to death when you
[3577.38 - 3582.62] think about that it's incredible really
[3580.02 - 3582.62] I mean
[3587.90 - 3592.44] nothing is
[3589.74 - 3595.02] seems which is
[3592.44 - 3599.24] prime example of that how come research
[3595.02 - 3599.24] in science doesn't know right
[3599.64 - 3604.14] that these are actually symptoms because
[3602.16 - 3605.88] the brain is starving
[3604.14 - 3608.84] how come like they don't know that when
[3605.88 - 3608.84] you think about that
[3611.10 - 3615.48] I mean another Century can go by and
[3614.04 - 3618.72] they'll never know what happens when
[3615.48 - 3620.72] alcohol is go you know is is actually
[3618.72 - 3620.72] um
[3621.36 - 3626.16] what alcohol is doing in the brain and
[3623.94 - 3628.08] the Damage that's being done another
[3626.16 - 3629.76] Century could go by and they still won't
[3628.08 - 3631.62] know
[3629.76 - 3633.54] so I was like having this Advanced
[3631.62 - 3635.88] information I like knowing all this
[3633.54 - 3638.04] stuff if someone says well I don't drink
[3635.88 - 3640.68] that's not really important to me that
[3638.04 - 3642.18] piece of information aw because I don't
[3640.68 - 3643.98] drink anything well then get other
[3642.18 - 3645.96] important pieces of information from the
[3643.98 - 3648.68] medical medium book series
[3645.96 - 3651.36] get all the the anti-viral information
[3648.68 - 3652.98] get the symptoms and conditions and the
[3651.36 - 3654.78] causes information
[3652.98 - 3656.94] get the different get the like
[3654.78 - 3659.40] information on like how to get medals
[3656.94 - 3661.08] out how to protect yourself get all that
[3659.40 - 3663.66] information that's in there
[3661.08 - 3665.76] if alcohol is not like your important
[3663.66 - 3667.44] thing because you don't drink or you
[3665.76 - 3671.06] don't care think about all the other
[3667.44 - 3671.06] information that's in the books
[3674.76 - 3680.52] so I mean that's important to know
[3678.24 - 3682.02] Brenda says they call it sedating but
[3680.52 - 3684.00] don't make the connection with the
[3682.02 - 3686.72] glucose
[3684.00 - 3686.72] foreign
[3692.76 - 3696.80] they still don't know why it's sedating
[3697.92 - 3701.84] they don't make the connection with any
[3699.54 - 3701.84] of it
[3702.00 - 3706.32] and they don't know that the brain is
[3704.16 - 3707.94] actually being injured
[3706.32 - 3710.16] they just observe things they don't
[3707.94 - 3711.60] actually see inside they don't know
[3710.16 - 3713.46] what's happening inside your bloodstream
[3711.60 - 3715.20] in your brain they're sitting there
[3713.46 - 3717.30] observing someone's reaction as they
[3715.20 - 3718.68] drink alcohol like anybody can do that a
[3717.30 - 3721.82] five-year-old can do that does that make
[3718.68 - 3721.82] the five-year-old scientist
[3722.94 - 3727.98] think about that right
[3725.64 - 3729.90] I mean when you think like a
[3727.98 - 3732.54] five-year-old can observe
[3729.90 - 3734.88] a parent drinking
[3732.54 - 3737.28] right
[3734.88 - 3739.62] think about that for a second and still
[3737.28 - 3742.68] have the same observation
[3739.62 - 3745.38] as a 40 year old scientist
[3742.68 - 3748.14] observing someone who's drinking
[3745.38 - 3752.18] think about that one right there
[3748.14 - 3752.18] is that five-year-old now a scientist
[3754.92 - 3758.28] foreign
[3756.20 - 3759.72] because they're still not going to know
[3758.28 - 3762.00] what happens in your brain when you're
[3759.72 - 3764.16] actually consuming alcohol if you guys
[3762.00 - 3766.56] if you guys are doing like
[3764.16 - 3770.40] keep in mind when you like see things
[3766.56 - 3773.16] like the lemon balm I put in right
[3770.40 - 3776.64] in the drink and stuff and all that keep
[3773.16 - 3779.34] in mind you don't want alcohol in your
[3776.64 - 3782.28] tinctures it's something I see every day
[3779.34 - 3785.10] someone would be like I I I've done this
[3782.28 - 3787.38] protocol from this guy or I've done this
[3785.10 - 3790.56] this method or this you know protocol
[3787.38 - 3791.70] and there's alcohol in all of the herbal
[3790.56 - 3795.48] tinctures
[3791.70 - 3800.00] and it just proves that alone is such a
[3795.48 - 3800.00] huge mistake it's incredible
[3801.00 - 3805.14] you guys I know I'm I'm wasting juice
[3803.16 - 3806.58] out of some of these right here what
[3805.14 - 3807.48] we're trying to do you know what
[3806.58 - 3810.12] happened
[3807.48 - 3812.76] these aren't juicy do you ever have an
[3810.12 - 3814.86] orange that's actually not juicy so I'm
[3812.76 - 3816.96] actually squeezing
[3814.86 - 3820.52] like the heck out of these more so than
[3816.96 - 3820.52] normal which is actually really funny
[3824.28 - 3827.06] foreign
[3827.30 - 3832.62] you can actually really squeeze like a
[3830.16 - 3835.62] lot of juice out of it really easy
[3832.62 - 3838.32] yeah Envy Doom says oh no not juicy yeah
[3835.62 - 3840.42] that's your Bane
[3838.32 - 3843.38] so you you actually experience that not
[3840.42 - 3843.38] juicy oranges
[3844.56 - 3849.26] yeah I know sometimes oranges are dry
[3846.30 - 3849.26] you know totally
[3850.68 - 3853.28] all right
[3855.48 - 3859.80] we're gonna do obviously some more so
[3857.40 - 3863.78] hang on you guys
[3859.80 - 3863.78] driest set of oranges
[3867.54 - 3871.26] yeah but that's okay because you know
[3869.52 - 3873.98] because I got this drink right now
[3871.26 - 3873.98] that's heating up
[3874.20 - 3877.70] it's getting warm so that's cool
[3884.10 - 3889.20] all right there we go now we're cranking
[3886.80 - 3892.50] out the juice
[3889.20 - 3895.02] I I squeeze my hand for a reason because
[3892.50 - 3897.30] I when I do it for myself and everything
[3895.02 - 3899.40] the reason why I like to squeeze by hand
[3897.30 - 3901.44] is because it's the connection to the
[3899.40 - 3903.96] food it's connection to the fruit on the
[3901.44 - 3905.58] tree it's all of that it's connecting to
[3903.96 - 3907.80] the food that's going to enter into my
[3905.58 - 3909.18] body so there's I don't talk about it
[3907.80 - 3910.86] much but there's all these spiritual
[3909.18 - 3913.14] connections that I actually have with
[3910.86 - 3915.42] the food and I talk about a little bit
[3913.14 - 3917.58] of that in life-changing Foods right if
[3915.42 - 3918.72] you've ever had that book or or read
[3917.58 - 3921.12] that book
[3918.72 - 3924.68] there's always these spiritual
[3921.12 - 3924.68] connections with our food
[3927.00 - 3931.32] and I never have time to talk about that
[3929.34 - 3933.24] I never have time to go into that or
[3931.32 - 3936.24] into a lot of details of that because
[3933.24 - 3938.10] I'm really busy making sure that
[3936.24 - 3940.20] everybody has the information they need
[3938.10 - 3942.24] to get out of chronic illness and then
[3940.20 - 3944.34] the spiritual stuff is you know is is
[3942.24 - 3945.60] fun about food for sure the connections
[3944.34 - 3947.76] and everything and we can talk about
[3945.60 - 3949.98] that but there's a lot of people
[3947.76 - 3953.28] suffering
[3949.98 - 3956.46] they're in so much body pain physically
[3953.28 - 3958.02] they're suffering mentally
[3956.46 - 3960.36] and I just try to get out that
[3958.02 - 3962.28] information because I want to save lives
[3960.36 - 3964.62] I want people to heal I want their lives
[3962.28 - 3965.88] to be saved right it's a lot of juice
[3964.62 - 3968.46] coming out of these big ones right here
[3965.88 - 3970.98] so this is great
[3968.46 - 3973.22] so I do it by hand because I want that
[3970.98 - 3973.22] connection
[3975.54 - 3980.16] rise of Melton says I love to eat with
[3977.46 - 3983.42] my hands as well
[3980.16 - 3983.42] yeah so definitely
