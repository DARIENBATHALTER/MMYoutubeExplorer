00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,800
it was mononucleosis

107
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,960
so after after two great virologists

108
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,120
discovered epstein-barr

109
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,199
they discovered well that was the reason

110
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,520
for mononucleosis

111
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:42,240
that was the discovery right there but

112
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,600
then you get mono it goes away

113
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,520

00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,320
that's it medical medium

115
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:50,160
changed all that epstein-barr

116
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,320
reactivated epstein-barr

117
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,759
epstein-barr causing more symptoms

118
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,000
neurological symptoms

119
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,520
neurological fatigue all this is all

120
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,560
this epstein-barr information is all

121
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,199
medical medium

122
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,400
doctors are using it worldwide that's

123
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,160
right

124
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,600
they talk about it on podcasts they talk

125
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,680
about it all over the place

126
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,000
and it originates from the publication

127
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,800
right here and also 35 years

128
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,680
of work so why am i even talking about

129
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,560
epsilon

130
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,080
you're wondering you don't have

131
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,960
epstein-barr you're thinking you're not

132
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,680
who cares

133
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,880
you don't have it everybody has it and

134
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,120
it awaits to come out

135
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,160
and the plague we're up against today

136
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,800
brings it out

137
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:29,919
that's medical medium information it was

138
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:32,240
published first by medical medium

139
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,759
and then it's being taken now okay and

140
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,880
they're calling it the long haul

141
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:38,720
covid now the long haul covet that's

142
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:42,080
what they call it

143
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:45,120
the long haul is epstein-barr

144
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:48,240
and i've seen bar causing that

145
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,840
right getting activated so i just spent

146
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,680
years talking about how the flu

147
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,000
activates epstein-barr how it lowers the

148
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,560
immune

149
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,280
immune system and activates epsom bar

150
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,400
and then i

151
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,520
published about how okay i published

152
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,840
about how

153
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,120
the plague we're up against today

154
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,120
instigates

155
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,880
right that's the textbook dr faun md

156
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,360
good to see you instigates

157
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,800
epstein barr and it comes out of

158
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,840
dormancy

159
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,840
hiding right

160
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,919
and all that one of the secrets to

161
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,120
healing

162
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:23,039
so ivan says try to taking little

163
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,479
let try taking a little less i was

164
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:27,360
allergic to apple

165
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:28,880
but it went away by chance by changing

166
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,240
the liver so by actually

167
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,560
helping your liver you're able to eat a

168
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,960
little bit more apple

169
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,639
anyway which is you know well if you're

170
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,080
cleaning up all the toxins and poisons

171
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,520
and all that you'd be surprised what you

172
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,280
can do once you start getting rid of all

173
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,520
those poisons and toxins and everything

174
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,520
else

175
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:48,160
so when it comes that dr faun good to

176
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,360
see you that it's an incredible textbook

177
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,319
really

178
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,639
it really is incredible medical textbook

179
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,800

00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,199
panic right

193
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,479
for a year plus right

194
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,960
over the plague that we've been up

195
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,720
against and then there's something out

196
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:29,360
there

197
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:32,720
that kills bugs kills bugs

198
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:35,520
actually destroys them kills for you

199
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,680
doesn't kill you it kills for you that's

200
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:40,160
what's incredible about celery juice

201
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,880
that's what's amazing now of course some

202
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,800
of you might

203
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,039
beg to differ and be like oh you can eat

204
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,720
some celery sticks and that's kind of

205
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,919
healthy you can have a couple of celery

206
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,560
sticks you could chew a few celery

207
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:50,800
sticks

208
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,759
that's healthy but celery can't do

209
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,800
anything for you

210
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:56,800
it can't do anything right

211
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,319
but we've seen something different

212
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,840
because millions of people are drinking

213
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,879
it getting their lives back

214
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:06,000
and they're using medical devices

215
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:08,879
that they don't need a prescription for

216
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,319
right do you need a prescription for

217
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,000
celery juice

218
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,360
random we'll call this says celery juice

219
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,840
lifted me out of

220
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,800
hell of insomnia so grateful that means

221
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,599
everything

222
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,720
that means everything think about that

223
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,560

would you

231
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,760

232
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,360
juice well i'm going to have to write a

233
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,560
prescription out to you

234
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,680
i'm going to have to write a

235
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:47,440
prescription you can't have celery juice

236
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,839
you know what's crazy about our world is

237
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:53,360
the medical industry

238
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:54,160
with love would love to like keep

239
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,360
everything

240
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,920
away from you everything like celery

241
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,959
juice

242
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:03,600
and supplementation they would love

243
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,959
to just keep it all under their watch

244
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,760
and then prescribe

245
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:09,200
a crappy version a shittier version if

246
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,760
they really wanted to like just

247
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,080
prescribe

248
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:14,480
something like that's what they would do

249
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:17,519
they're going to do it to b12

250
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,720
they're going to do it to vitamin c in

251
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,760
in the future people are not going to be

252
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,720
able to get vitamin c they're not going

253
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,120
to be able to buy i think it's going to

254
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,240
have to be

255
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:26,399
prescribed by a physician if the

256
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,080
physician believes that it's okay to do

257
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:31,920
and if the physician isn't

258
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:33,519
watched isn't watched

259
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,680
meaning like watched because they're

260
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,720
prescribing too much vitamin c

261
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,279
so they're going to be they're going to

262
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,760
be under limitations where

263
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:44,240
where doctors down the road years down

264
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,080
the road mark my word right here

265
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,640
years down the road doctors are going to

266
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:52,480
be they're going to be prescribing

267
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:56,000
vitamin c and it's small dosages

268
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:59,200
like okay 250 milligrams a day

269
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,120
one tablet here you go

270
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,959
big pharma took over the vitamin c they

271
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,360
own it now here you go

272
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,480
that's how it's going to go no one's

273
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:10,079
going to be able to get better

274
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:12,399
like that but that's how they want it

275
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:13,519
because if you're rogue if you're doing

276
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:17,200
things

277
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,600
your way you're rogue that's what you

278
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,720
are

279
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:23,040
you're rogue and because right now we're

280
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,640
allowed to take vitamin c

281
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,640
you know that's what i take is the

282
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:29,120
microc right there

283
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,839
but we're allowed to take vitamin c we

284
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,920
are

285
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,200
i take a whole bunch you can ask your

286
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,959
doctor what's right for you i'm just

287
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:39,440
telling you for me and my family

288
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:42,240
we take a lot of it we take a lot of it

289
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,440
so but eventually down the road it's all

290
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,880
going to be taken away from everybody

291
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,079
way down the road

292
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,240
and it's going to be under prescription

293
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,360
only and it's going to be a real crappy

294
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,560
kind

295
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,399
and they're going to be like here's

296
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,680
here's your prescribed dosage is all you

297
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,800
can take right there

298
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,640
that's what's going to happen down the

299
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,640
road just giving everybody the 4-1-1

300
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,240
same thing with b12

301
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,480
not going to have the freedom down the

302
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,240
road to just have b12

303
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,000
because science research and big pharma

304
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,440
and powers at b

305
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,519
and powers above and all the

306
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,519
illuminations

307
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:13,760
the illuminations are going to make sure

308
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:15,440
they have full control over our b12 too

309
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,680
so you get the crappy kind and it's

310
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:21,440
prescribed by only prescription

311
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:25,440
probably through shot only b12 shot

312
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,000
b12 shot and i told you guys about the

313
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,279
b12

314
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,560
shots you can do what you want do your

315
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:33,600
doctor tells you

316
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:35,440
but i would never let vitamin b12 go

317
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,560
into my arm through an ejection and

318
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:40,959
through an injection

319
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:45,360
ever ever ever vitamin b12

320
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:48,640
that's just me personally and my family

321
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:51,040
and but

322
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:53,120
down the road it's different when it

323
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,399
goes into the vein when b12 goes into

324
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:58,079
intravenous

325
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:59,839
vitamins the vein is different so

326
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:03,360
if you're getting intravenous iv

327
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:05,440
vitamins if you're someone like that

328
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,800
and you're getting vitamin b through the

329
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,079
veins

330
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:13,920
that's different but through an actual

331
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:17,279
injection a shot right

332
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:20,639
i would never get b12 ever

333
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:25,440
injected into the body like

334
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:27,120
from the outside the vein is different

335
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,639
go back to what i was saying and because

336
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,120
what happens is when you get when you

337
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,720
get

338
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:36,079
b12 shots you guys on clubhouse

339
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:38,800
guys on tick tick tick tock facebook

340
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:41,200
youtube when you get b12 shots you can

341
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,959
become allergic to b12

342
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,880
i've talked about this in the past your

343
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:48,079
body can build an

344
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:53,600
antibody against b12

345
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:56,399
making you in trouble with b12

346
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,240
if you had that before it's okay that

347
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,000
can be turned around

348
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,839
go to your doctor and you say hey i only

349
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,519
i only want to be on b12

350
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:07,680
oral b12 you can change

351
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,519
you can change things up and it turns

352
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:13,440
things around

353
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,440
michelle l said b12 shots killed her

354
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:20,399
you seem fine to me chris chris is wow

355
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:24,639
um good to see you so

356
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:29,200
me personally i would never ever

357
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:31,440
take a b12 shot vitamin b12

358
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,519
in a needle going into the body into the

359
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:37,040
arm into the leg into the butt

360
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:39,120
whatever that's me personally

361
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:41,600
so i have my friends and family do the

362
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:44,079
oral b12

363
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,880
and as far as vitamin c goes enjoy it

364
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:48,399
why it's

365
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:50,240
here because it won't be down the road

366
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,680
but enjoy it why it's here so why am i

367
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,399
talking about this a lot of people

368
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,839
aren't going to be

369
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:56,720
are going to have the access to vitamin

370
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:59,920
c years down the road

371
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,519
but we're going to have celery we're

372
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,839
still going to have celery access for a

373
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:07,040
while i really believe that

374
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:08,959
and eventually that's going to get weird

375
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,880
and they're going to halt the farming

376
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:13,519
productions down they're going to

377
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,320

marissa

479
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:33,039
and so let's go into this a little bit

480
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,640
more we have information to cover

481
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:36,799
they want to erwin says they want to

482
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,320
keep us sick they have to keep us sick

483
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:40,880
the industries have to keep you sick

484
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:44,400
that's how it works and

485
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:47,200
one way you know is that there are

486
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,960
thousands upon thousands upon thousands

487
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,240
of healing stories of celery juice

488
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,919
helping people get out

489
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:55,280
of the woods and into the light right

490
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,679
but the industry they just they don't

491
00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:01,120
want to know about that they don't

492
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:04,160
because because god forbid we hurt their

493
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:05,200
pockets we hurt the yachts that they

494
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,880
ride on

495
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,240
and we hear about all of it we hurt

496
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,520
their pockets

497
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:14,640
right massive massive mansions all that

498
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:16,080
built by people being sick right people

499
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,320
being sick

500
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,760
and so celery juice is one of these

501
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,760
things that's really helpful so here we

502
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:24,240
go we got a plague

503
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,280
circling the planet right everybody's

504
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,960
worried about it

505
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:32,240
right and has been worried about it

506
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:35,120
and we have a bug killer

507
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,960
at the grocery store so we have a bug

508
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:40,880
killer at the grocery store

509
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:43,280
because celery juice kills

510
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,080
it kills it's really incredible when you

511
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,440
think about it

512
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,120
i just want to look i want to cover a

513
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:50,320
couple little things you guys

514
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:51,280
first of all the mm-900 hds i don't know

515
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:54,960
if you guys

516
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:57,919
have seen this user mm-900 hds

517
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,480
um anyway it's 82 off just letting you

518
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:01,600
guys know

519
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:04,720
it's still on sale 25 off um

520
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:06,080
letting people know so in case someone

521
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,440
this is their chance or something

522
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,039
at this time because it's such a break

523
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,120
on there if you got any juice or use it

524
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:13,200
because your juicer is a medical tool

525
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,720
keep that in mind

526
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,000
people ask me all the time what juicer

527
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,520
do i use with juicer what do you mean

528
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,799
it's a medical tool what do you mean

529
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,640
the minute i said that everybody's like

530
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:21,600
what do you mean it's it's a medical

531
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,679
tool

532
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,679
i see it as a medical tool that's my

533
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:28,159
opinion

534
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:30,480
i i wonder what your your opinion is you

535
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:32,480
guys but my opinion is

536
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,159
it's a medical tool i talk to doctors

537
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,799
all the time and i'm like

538
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:39,120
look it's a medical tool like how is it

539
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:42,320
a medical tool

540
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:46,480
it's created to extract

541
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:50,080
herbal medicine so herbal medicine

542
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:51,679
it extracts herbal medicine so we can do

543
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,880
some healing

544
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:57,919
ernest says omega h um omega

545
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,840
mm 900 hds is the best juicer ever

546
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:02,240
it really is it really is i'm going to

547
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,679
do some juicing in a minute to you guys

548
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,520
what i like about the juicer is it pays

549
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,880
for itself i told you that before

550
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,799
sound like a broken record the other

551
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,520
reason i like it is because it's not

552
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:12,880
dealing with

553
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:14,480
metal always touching metal so that's a

554
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:17,840
juice there's a lot of juicers out there

555
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:19,600
there's so much metal everywhere and so

556
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,679
and that metal just starts to kind of

557
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,440
corrode that's what metal does it

558
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:25,760
corrodes

559
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,280
it it eventually starts to break down

560
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,200
that's what metal does

561
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,559
and so that's what i don't like you know

562
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,720
about the other juicers

563
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:34,080
this doesn't have that crystal clear

564
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,480
says

565
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,400
it really is a miracle i was miserable

566
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,480
every year with hay fever

567
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,159
and it made it disappear for real so if

568
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,960
celery juice

569
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:46,080
made something that was keeping you

570
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,280
miserable

571
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:51,520
every single year the worst hay fever

572
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:53,440
and it got rid of that what do you think

573
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:56,960
is going on there

574
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:59,840
one reason is hay fever

575
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,960
really is something else right you get

576
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:04,480
sensitive

577
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:07,760
to plants to weeds that are growing

578
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:09,360
you get sensitive to pollen you get

579
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:13,679
sensitive to dust

580
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:17,520
grass dust right it gets sensitive to

581
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:19,919
to um pine pollen okay

582
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:22,799
oak tree pollen maple pump you get

583
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:24,880
sensitive to all the pollen right

584
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:26,000
and then but one of the reasons why is

585
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,000
because there's something else

586
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,919
underlying so whenever it comes down to

587
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,159
allergies and stuff like that sinus

588
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:32,880
allergies where it's eye related sinus

589
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,520
related

590
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,640
hay fever in the head all that stuff in

591
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,559
the lungs you're dealing with

592
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,640
streptococcus

593
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:42,480
and then you start bringing celery in

594
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,360
and you start killing the strep

595
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:47,200
and when you start killing the strep you

596
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:50,880
can all of a sudden handle

597
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:54,720
that ragweed you can handle all that

598
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:56,159
white ragweed all that hay

599
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,159
and that's what's incredible about it

600
00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:01,919
right there

601
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:05,039
um love god celery juice stopped my

602
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:07,120

00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,120
kills and it kills for you that's what

608
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:21,360

632
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,880
elizabeth says hey buddy and

633

634
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:19,760
something too you guys before i do a

635
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:23,360

00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:27,279
so what i got right here in front of me

638
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,960
you guys recognize this

639
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:30,320
is this mm glass right here a little

640
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,880
ammo class

641
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:34,720
so what i got tick-tock you guys

642
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:37,360
facebook youtube

643
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:39,440
clubhouse i i have some kidneys in front

644
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,799
of me right now

645
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,080
and what you're looking on top though

646
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:43,360
what you're looking at on top of these

647
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:46,559
kidneys is

648
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:48,720
what's this you guys right

649
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:50,640
that's your adrenals right there so

650
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,440
you're looking at your adrenals

651
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:55,440
and what i love about celery juice is

652
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,039
celery is used to something absolutely

653
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:01,279
amazing

654
00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:03,520
it helps restore your adrenal glands

655
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:05,039
just like it helps to restore your

656
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:07,120
stomach lens remember the other day you

657
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:08,960
guys

658
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,159
remember the other day talking about the

659
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:13,919
stomach

660
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:15,679
right about the stomach and the stomach

661
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:17,200
glands that's your hcl

662
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:19,120
cellular juice helps to bring your

663
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,919
depleted stomach glands back

664
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:24,320
rebuilding your hcl so your hcl could

665
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:28,400
then kill pathogens

666
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:30,799
right yeah renata says it's the adrenals

667
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:34,080
my poor mom has adrenal cancer

668
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:36,799
i'm so sorry to hear that um

669
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:39,679
that's really difficult to to i mean she

670
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:39,679
must be struggling

671
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:45,039
so what happens is these stomach glands

672
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,799
um

673
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:48,320
they restore from that celery juice now

674
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:49,919
something else restores from that soy

675
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:52,159
juice

676
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:53,200
it's your adrenal glands so that's the

677
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:55,200
next thing

678
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,279
so the sodium cluster salts the trace

679
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:00,080
mineral salts and celery juice

680
00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:02,400
go into your stomach glands and help

681
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:05,440
restore it

682
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:09,120
and then celery juice goes into

683
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:11,200
adrenal tissue as well and helps restore

684
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,640
it because

685
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,520
that's when they get depleted when they

686
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:18,720
get deleted they lose trace minerals

687
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:22,320
the cells in your adrenals need

688
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:24,880
a certain amount of trace minerals

689
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:26,799
and we lose those trace minerals we're

690
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,600
not getting them in good sources in good

691
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:29,440
places

692
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,279
we're under fight or flight we're

693
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:34,559
tanking the caffeine

694
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:37,279
we're taking the caffeine guys don't mat

695
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:38,799

chris chris you seem fine of me you want

710
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,200
a piece of chocolate with me

711
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:09,520
we're on coffee break right now all

712
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,320
right

713
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:14,480
just one more sip i gotta get high i got

714
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,480
it

715
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:20,559
it's actually really good that's really

716
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:21,840
good coffee too incredible

717
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:23,679
one thing to know about our adrenal

718
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:27,600
glands is coffee is like its number one

719
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:28,720
enemy chocolate it's it's number one

720
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,320
enemy too

721
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,080
so the reason why we lose our adrenals

722
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,120
over time and women lose their hair

723
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:35,679
because women are not supposed to have

724
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:38,240
hair loss they lose their hair

725
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:39,200
and their skin gets aged before it's

726
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:42,080
time

727
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,440
part of that is the adrenals dying the

728
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:46,159
adrenals die

729
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,200
so what happens is when we're aging

730
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:50,399
there's parts of us

731
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:53,039
inside of us that are actually dying our

732
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:57,120
liver starts to die

733
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:58,320
yeah and organs can die before we die do

734
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,279
you ever guys ever notice that

735
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,679
why do you think somebody can have a

736
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:02,000
heart condition and when someone has

737
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:04,240
heart

738
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,200
failure yeah and they're told they have

739
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,880
heart failure right

740
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,120
well it's like when you get diagnosed

741
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:12,000
with heart failure what does that mean

742
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:13,679
that means you're alive that means

743
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,799
you're alive

744
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:20,480
but your heart's dying right it's sick

745
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:22,320
think about that i mean isn't that crazy

746
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:25,279
how it works

747
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:28,000
we're alive we're living our lives and

748
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:31,440
organs in us

749
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:34,880
can start to die

750
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:37,120
and so what happens with adrenals

751
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:40,159
that's one of those glands that

752
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:40,159
endocrine system glands

753
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:45,039
those start to die slowly but you don't

754
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:48,480
want them

755
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:50,240
dying before we die you see how it works

756
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,799
i know this is intense to talk about you

757
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:56,080
don't want your adrenal glands

758
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:59,840
to putting before you

759
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,840
ever kaput in your life right

760
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:05,440
and so what happens with caffeine

761
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,960
i know i'm giving you guys a little

762
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,919
caffeine talk for a couple seconds you

763
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:11,840
guys love that

764
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:12,960
right caffeine destroys our adrenal

765
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,320
glands

766
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,320
i get it you know somebody who drank

767
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,600
coffee for 30 years they're fine i get

768
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,039
it

769
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,320
a lot of people drink coffee for two

770
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:22,640
years and they're not fine they blew out

771
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:25,520
their adrenals

772
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:27,039
yeah a lot of people eat chocolate they

773
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,640
burn out their adrenals

774
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:30,320
but it's the caffeine you know the

775
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:34,159
matcha tea or the chocolate

776
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:36,320
the coffee that caffeine

777
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:37,679
burns out our adrenals so you got to

778
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,960
think about your adrenals because

779
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:40,559
without them we

780
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:43,279
really are we're in trouble with outer

781
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:46,080
adrenals we're in big trouble

782
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:47,200
and if you're drinking your celery juice

783
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,760
and somebody says why are you drinking

784
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,120
your celery

785
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:51,039
are you drinking celery juice because of

786
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:54,000
that crazy medical medium

787
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:57,279
because uh that guy who's a medium who

788
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,720
talks to a spirit

789
00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:00,799
why are you drinking celery you're

790
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:02,320
drinking celery juice

791
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:04,880
because you want to keep your adrenals

792
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:06,799
strong you want those restored you want

793
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:10,480
those recovered

794
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:13,279
you want your adrenals to come back

795
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:15,279
you want them strong you want them

796
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:17,200
strong

797
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:18,799
so it's so important so let's talk about

798
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:21,600
how celery juice does that i'm going to

799
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:22,960
juice a little bit of celery now

800
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,799

00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:36,320
kills because it does

805
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:39,840
it does it kills the bugs

806
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:39,840

809
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,000
viruses and bacteria and what they do

810
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:48,320
and what they cause

811
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,520
and i've i've i've talked to a lot of

812
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,440
deaf ears

813
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:53,039

00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:55,440
professionals i've talked to a lot of

816
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:58,480
professionals we're like

817
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:00,080
there's no way there's no way pathogens

818
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,960
have anything to do with anything

819
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:03,200
there's no way

820
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,720
and then and then the whole world shuts

821
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:07,760
down

822
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,399
over a pathogen now you got all these

823
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,080
people

824
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:12,480
they're not being held accounted

825
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:13,519
accountable for being so ignorant about

826
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,519
pathogens

827
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:16,559

everybody's a virus expert now

830
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,159
when two years ago they didn't even

831
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,840
think they existed

832
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:27,760

registerable

940
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:38,960
they can be seen right through testing

941
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,640
did you want to stay off the animal

942
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:43,680
protein

943
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:45,520
i'm not anti-animal protein okay i'm not

944
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:47,680
anti-plant-based either

945
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:49,920
i support both sides of the aisle always

946
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,920
have

947
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:56,960
i don't judge anybody either way

948
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:59,440
i know the animal protein people when

949
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,950
they get irritated they'll say the vegan

950
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:03,040
mommies are starving their kids

951
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:05,920
[Music]

952
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:07,200
i know starving of a protein i know the

953
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:09,839
plant-based

954
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:11,200
people will get mad at the animal

955
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:12,880
protein people

956
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,480
say they have a lack of understanding

957
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:18,079
about you know

958
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:18,079
animals having souls and stuff

959
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:22,000
but too much protein kills the kidney

960
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,480
and you can kill the kidneys too as a

961
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,599
vegan

962
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,839
you can kill your kidneys as a

963
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:27,200
plant-based person you can do too many

964
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:30,160
nut butters

965
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:31,680
right you can kill your kidneys with too

966
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:33,520
much fat

967
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,880
definitely too much protein we can kill

968
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:36,800
our kidneys but

969
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:38,960
the thing is right i'm gonna take this

970
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,960
kidney apart you guys

971
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,320
okay those kidney stones they started

972
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:44,240
really tiny and they sit in the nooks

973
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,920
and crannies of your kidney

974
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:47,040
right in the little nooks and crannies

975
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,000
that's what they do they start out

976
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,760
really tiny

977
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,440
and they start to grow kidney stones

978
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:53,839
actually grow

979
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:55,359
they become like a magnet actually and

980
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:58,640
they collect more sediment

981
00:36:55,359 --> 00:37:01,280
and more sediment and more sediment

982
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:02,320
but the kidney stones are really an

983
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:05,520
indication

984
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:06,880
that you got two options you got calcium

985
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,760
based stones you got protein based

986
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,520
stones

987
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,440
you can have a mix you can have calcium

988
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:13,599
protein-based stones

989
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:15,200
but let me give you like a couple of

990
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:16,560
takeaways just right off the bat this

991
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,000
might be worth the price of admission

992
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:20,640
even though all this is free

993
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,520
it's always free here at medical medium

994
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,280
but

995
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,640
if you're dealing with a calcium-based

996
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:28,240
stone

997
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:30,160
the caffeine the vinegar

998
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:32,560
that will take you down that road

999
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:36,400
because the caffeine and the vinegar

1000
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:37,440
will suck the life out of your bones and

1001
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,960
teeth

1002
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:41,839
it'll pull in pull pull but actually

1003
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:44,400
pull out

1004
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:45,920
all that good calcium okay it's one

1005
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,520
thing that happens too

1006
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:49,440
another thing that happens is if you're

1007
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:51,599
eating dairy products

1008
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,480
if you're eating eggs if you're eating

1009
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:55,599
too much dairy

1010
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:58,160
milk cheese butter then you can also get

1011
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:59,680
a calcium stone from all of that

1012
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,440
but you can get a calcium stone from

1013
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,560
either calcium being removed from your

1014
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,560
bones

1015
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,920
and teeth and it ends up piling up in

1016
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,680
the kidneys

1017
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:09,040
so when you're doing your caffeine when

1018
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:12,240
you're doing your coffee

1019
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:13,520
when you're doing your chocolate

1020
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:18,720
right when you're doing your coffee and

1021
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:20,800
you're doing your chocolate

1022
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:21,839
you're actually removing calcium from

1023
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,599
your bones

1024
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:25,280
so let me get something else for you

1025
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:28,720
guys you guys are still here

1026
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:33,520
don't worry still here

1027
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:36,160
still mashing it we're still here

1028
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:37,839
okay right here i got a jaw for you tik

1029
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,480
tok can you guys see this clubhouse i'm

1030
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:41,359
holding

1031
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:44,320
a jaw that's a big tongue right here so

1032
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:47,440
if you guys could see that big tongue

1033
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:50,480
so that's the lower jaw

1034
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:51,359
okay that's the bone the jaw bone that's

1035
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,599
your teeth

1036
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:56,800
okay guys so when you're doing your cat

1037
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:59,680
when you're doing your caffeine

1038
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:00,079
you're drawing calcium from inside your

1039
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:03,119
teeth

1040
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:04,640
and your jaw that calcium that gets

1041
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:05,280
drawn out ends up piling inside your

1042
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:07,599
kidneys

1043
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:09,280
i'm pointing to your kidney now so it

1044
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:10,880
ends up becoming little calcium stones

1045
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,560
inside your kidney

1046
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:14,000
calcium stones that can't be seen on

1047
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:16,160
testing tiny

1048
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,079
ones lots of tiny ones and you pee them

1049
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:19,680
out

1050
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:20,960
a lot of them don't build up they don't

1051
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:23,200
get caught in there and they don't

1052
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:24,720
become a big old calcium kidney stone

1053
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:26,800
they get caught in there and then you

1054
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:28,000
build them up build them up build them

1055
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,160
up because they get caught in there you

1056
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,200
guys and caught in there right

1057
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:34,480
so what's happening is you keep on doing

1058
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,839
your caffeine you keep on doing your

1059
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,119
chocolate you keep on doing your plant

1060
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:38,240
medicine chocolate you keep on doing

1061
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:39,920
your matcha tea

1062
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:43,200
what you do is you keep on drawing

1063
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:46,800
calcium from your teeth and your jaw

1064
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:50,320
and your bones right

1065
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:51,920
you keep on drawing that and then

1066
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:53,359
it ends up in the kidney now when it

1067
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:55,440
ends up in the kidney you get these tiny

1068
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:56,079
little calcium deposits crystallized

1069
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,920
calcium

1070
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:59,119
in your kidneys and you urinate them out

1071
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,880
most of them out

1072
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:02,720
you think hey i'm pretty good right now

1073
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,839
i don't have i don't have any kidney

1074
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:05,839
stones

1075
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:08,000
nothing that seeable but you have the

1076
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:10,960
everyday kidney stones

1077
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,640
which nobody talks about nobody talks

1078
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,160
about the crystallizations that form

1079
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,880
there every single day because of the

1080
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,560
caffeine

1081
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,800
because of your chocolate because of

1082
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:20,560
your tea and

1083
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:23,280
all those little crystallizations they

1084
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:25,680
all deposit inside that kidney

1085
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:27,839
and here's what's sad about it you're

1086
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:31,119
pissing out

1087
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:33,200
your critical needed your your calcium

1088
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:34,640
your own calcium the calcium that holds

1089
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:36,319
your bones together you're peeing your

1090
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:39,440
own calcium out

1091
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:42,560
you're you're pissing out that's

1092
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:43,920
how it goes so okay i don't have a

1093
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:45,359
kidney stone right now everything's all

1094
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,480
clear it looks good no kidney stones

1095
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:47,920
than me

1096
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:49,760
meanwhile you're peeing out lots of

1097
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,960
kidney stones every single day lots of

1098
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,240
kidney stones you're peeing out all your

1099
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,839
calcium stones

1100
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:56,640
calcium stones that are created because

1101
00:40:53,839 --> 00:41:00,560
it's just being sucked out of your jaw

1102
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:01,839
being sucked out of your lower jaw

1103
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:03,839
being sucked out of your bones that's

1104
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:07,280
why women go to osteopenia it's why they

1105
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:10,640
head there just letting you guys know so

1106
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:10,640
your coffee every day

1107
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:16,960
slowly draws the calcium out

1108
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:18,079
and then we do too much fat and too much

1109
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:20,720
protein and we

1110
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:22,880
kill our kidneys it's another thing too

1111
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:24,480
we kill our kidneys

1112
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:26,240
then too much fat and protein can bring

1113
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:28,560
some calcium out of your bones as well

1114
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:30,319
but now let's go into the vinegar really

1115
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,880
quick the apple cider vinegar or any

1116
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:32,400
kind of

1117
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:34,880
vinegar red wine vinegar balsamic

1118
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:38,960
vinegar whatever vinegar you want

1119
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:40,319
vinegar draws acetic acid draws calcium

1120
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:43,200
from your bones and teeth too

1121
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:44,640
and then this tires your kidneys out so

1122
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:46,400
when i see somebody eating vinegar i'm

1123
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:48,240
like you're tiring your kidneys out

1124
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:50,160
sure you don't see it in the moment but

1125
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:51,680
you're going to see it 30 years from now

1126
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:53,680
20 years from now you're going to see it

1127
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:55,040
somewhere down the line

1128
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,640
and one thing spirit of compassion

1129
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:58,160
taught me when i was younger is how to

1130
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,880
have that foresight how to see

1131
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:01,440
everything

1132
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:03,040
how to like know and see so again you

1133
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,480
see somebody and spirit of compassion

1134
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:06,800
will tell me well yeah they have

1135
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:08,880
about eight crystals in their kidneys

1136
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:11,839
today they have to pee and urinate those

1137
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,839
eight crystals out today

1138
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:14,480
and then what i'd say spirit of

1139
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,760
compassion well what's gonna happen down

1140
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:17,359
the road well they're going to keep on

1141
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,640
urinating those crystals out and keep on

1142
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:20,160
losing and depleting their calcium in

1143
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:21,680
the bones that person's going to get an

1144
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,319
osteoporosis diagnosis that person's

1145
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:24,560
going to go

1146
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:26,079
to get osteopenia diagnosis that person

1147
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:27,680
is going to need jaw work

1148
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:29,040
bone graft that person's going to need

1149
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:30,240
bone graft that person is going to lose

1150
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,920
all their teeth that person

1151
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:34,319
i i heard this ultimate that person's

1152
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:37,040
skull is going to shrink

1153
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:37,599
that one's terrible i want to cover that

1154
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:40,400
real quick

1155
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:42,560
too that's important we're juicing

1156
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:45,520
celery we're using the mm-900 hds

1157
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:49,200
incredible medical device

1158
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:49,200
it's it's an amazing medical device

1159
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:53,200
so you guys see this right here in

1160
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:56,880
clubhouse i'm holding a brain

1161
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:56,880
a head a skull

1162
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:02,960
so here's what happens as you get older

1163
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:06,079
you lose the calcium in your skull

1164
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:07,680
your skull shrinks and when you get

1165
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:11,280
older your skull is like

1166
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:12,800
half the size because we have these

1167
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:16,480
practices in our life

1168
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:19,359
to draw calcium out of our body we do

1169
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:20,000
all the caffeine we do all the vinegar

1170
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:23,200
and we

1171
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:26,000
are removing calcium from our skull

1172
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:26,720
it's ever so mildly done it's like it's

1173
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,480
really

1174
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:33,040
minor yeah you don't see it fast

1175
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:35,280
but it happens but then that day when

1176
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:36,640
you're 65 years old and you slip on some

1177
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,319
ice outside and you

1178
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:40,319
land on the back your head and doctor

1179
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:42,319
says well you shouldn't have cracked

1180
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:43,920
your skull open

1181
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:46,240
you shouldn't have fractured your skull

1182
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:47,920
but you're getting older

1183
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:49,440
so you got more kind of a little bit

1184
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:50,319
more feeble a little bit more you're

1185
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:52,480
delicate

1186
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:53,680
you got older what happened is the

1187
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:55,920
reason why your skull

1188
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:58,880
fracture's so easy versus when you were

1189
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:00,640
20 and you bend your head

1190
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:02,000
you were at a pool party when you're 20

1191
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:04,079
years old

1192
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,599
right you slip on the deck and you bang

1193
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:09,680
your head on the deck but your

1194
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:11,200
your skull doesn't fracture

1195
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:13,440
because you got enough calcium in your

1196
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:14,160
skull right you're 65 years old you slip

1197
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,920
on a deck

1198
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:17,839
you bend your head you're in the you're

1199
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,960
in the hospital you've got a fractured

1200
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:21,599
skull

1201
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:22,000
because the calcium's been depleting

1202
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:23,839
throughout

1203
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,200
the years nobody talks about cranial

1204
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:27,520
calcium no one

1205
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:29,760
it's medical medium information linda

1206
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:31,680
says why don't doctors tell us all this

1207
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:33,040
they're too busy writing prescriptions

1208
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,440
and the functional medicine doctors are

1209
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,960
too

1210
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:37,680
too busy bankrolling with the highest

1211
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:39,040
prices i've ever seen these days

1212
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:40,560
i've seen some functional medicine

1213
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:42,720
doctors people got to see them it's

1214
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:45,520
twenty two hundred dollars

1215
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:47,599
to see them they got a huge waiting list

1216
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:49,119
but it's like twenty two hundred dollars

1217
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:51,440
and here's what they get here's your gut

1218
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:53,839

the keto diet

1227
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:10,400
and we're going to draw the life out of

1228
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:12,480
you we're going to suck every last

1229
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:14,319
drop of blood out of you and take 14

00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,720
vials of blood and make sure we do all

1231
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:18,400
this

1232
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:20,240
useless testing because a lot of it is

1233
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:21,520
it's not the stuff people need to be

1234
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:23,200
looking at like for all

1235
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:25,599
all the viral panels and stuff that's

1236
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:26,720
what they really need to be looking at

1237
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:29,520
it's like and then we're going to take

1238
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:32,560
14 to 20 vials out of you

1239
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:33,839

i just saved myself a ton of money

1271
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:52,160
ton of money because i only had to use a

1272
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:55,440
little bit of celery

1273
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:57,520
for all this juice this is insane

1274
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:59,599
you gotta strain your celery juice i've

1275
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:01,440
said this a thousand times

1276
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:03,359
you guys if it look i know some of you

1277
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:04,720
guys are total vets

1278
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:05,920
when it comes down to celery juice you

1279
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,480
guys been doing it for a while you've

1280
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:08,079
been

1281
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:09,680
following the medical medium information

1282
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:10,640
spirit of compassions books and stuff

1283
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:12,240
and you've been

1284
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:13,760
you've been like diligently doing your

1285
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:15,200
celery juice you strain it all the time

1286
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:17,040
and i know i sound like a broken record

1287
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:18,560
probably but i can't tell you how every

1288
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,200
day i see people they're just juicing

1289
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,640
celery

1290
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:23,520
they're not straining it and it's a

1291
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:26,559
no-no you have to strain it you guys

1292
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:27,920
you have to i'm just being straight up

1293
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:30,240
about that

1294
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:31,440
you've got to strain it i'm kind of

1295
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:34,160
doing this in a weird way so i'm

1296
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:35,680
spilling a few drops

1297
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:37,280
but that's only because i'm being sloppy

1298
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:38,800
because i'm actually doing this in front

1299
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:42,000
of juicer my arm's all wrapped around

1300
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:42,000
and i'm not even like looking

1301
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:46,079
so i spilled a couple of tiny drops

1302
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:50,800
there which really is sad

1303
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:50,800
because i don't normally do that at all

1304
00:47:50,839 --> 00:47:54,079
okay so

1305
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:58,480
look what you have right there and what

1306
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,920
you can do is too you'll have a little

1307
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:01,920
bit of pulp in the strainer

1308
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:03,520
and you can squeeze that out right till

1309
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:07,839
it's dry to the bone which i do

1310
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:11,200
i do i love that but look at this

1311
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:12,000
that's your pulp i've never seen that

1312
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:16,480
anywhere

1313
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:18,800
and that's my juice which is incredible

1314
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:21,119
which is incredible which is incredible

1315
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:24,880
it really is um

1316
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:27,760
this is the mm-900 hds it's 82

1317
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:29,040
off but it's the mm-900 hds i told you

1318
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:30,079
guys i'm working with the company on

1319
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:32,800
this because

1320
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:33,599
when they told me that they had this

1321
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:36,880
idea

1322
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:39,119
where they can they can literally

1323
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:40,720
squeeze as much juice as we can out of

1324
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:42,800
celery i was like i'm on board

1325
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:44,559
i'm on board how do we keep this thing

1326
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:46,960
here so it doesn't go away i need people

1327
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:50,720
to have an opportunity

1328
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:52,079
um 32 ounces of celery juice

1329
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:53,440
is what i drink every single morning

1330
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:54,640
sometimes i'll drink more sometimes i'll

1331
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:58,599
drink a little less

1332
00:48:54,640 --> 00:49:01,280
anyway it's omegajuicers.com omega omega

1333
00:48:58,599 --> 00:49:04,400
juicers.com omegajuicers.com

1334
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:08,559
they have a sale right now it's 25 off

1335
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:11,520
mm-900 hds 82. you save

1336
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:12,160
but what's incredible you have to strain

1337
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:15,520
it

1338
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:16,240
you have to because the pulp and the

1339
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:18,000
fiber

1340
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:20,160
get in the way of the medicine this is

1341
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,559
an herbal extraction

1342
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:23,920
it's just like an herbal tea you have to

1343
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:25,200
strain the tea

1344
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:26,880
it's an herbal extraction but the

1345
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:28,640
difference with celery juice you really

1346
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:31,839
have to strain it

1347
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:31,839
okay really important

1348
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:36,400
you can you know and and here's how it

1349
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:37,839
goes

1350
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:40,400
pulp and fiber get in the way of the

1351
00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:41,200
sodium cluster salts we're doing herbal

1352
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:44,240
medicine

1353
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:46,480
so you're witnessing a medical tool and

1354
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:50,160
what it's doing is it's extracting

1355
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:53,040
herbal medicine it's extracting medicine

1356
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:54,319
from celery that's how you have to look

1357
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:56,559
at it that's how i look at it every

1358
00:49:54,319 --> 00:49:59,280
single morning that's how i see it

1359
00:49:56,559 --> 00:50:00,880
then it really is what it is right and

1360
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:02,720
if the pulpit fiber is in the way it

1361
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:03,920
interferes with the sodium cluster salts

1362
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:06,160
and i know i've been showing you guys

1363
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:06,160
this

1364
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:15,760
what's in what's in celery salt

1365
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:19,359
right the healthy form the macro

1366
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:21,520
sodium right okay

1367
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:22,640
but what's around there at least is the

1368
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:24,960
subgroup of sodium

1369
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:28,319
sodium cluster salts they float around

1370
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:28,319
and suspend in a living fluid

1371
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:32,079
that's the subgroup of sodium sodium

1372
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:34,000
cluster salts

1373
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:35,359
that's it trace mineral salts and what

1374
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,839
happens is that

1375
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:38,800
when you have fiber and pulp it gets in

1376
00:50:37,839 --> 00:50:41,920
the way of this

1377
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:45,119
you have to extract this from the

1378
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:47,200
stalks of celery in order for this to

1379
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:51,440
kill for you

1380
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:53,280
celery juice kills it does

1381
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:55,680
so here's what happens let me just show

1382
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:58,480
you guys right here okay

1383
00:50:55,680 --> 00:51:00,319
here's a pathogen right here so here's a

1384
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:04,319
pathogen

1385
00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:04,319
i'm gonna do a little drawing here

1386
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:11,839
that's a pathogen okay you guys see that

1387
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:14,960
in tic toc you guys see that

1388
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:16,480
that pathogen when it goes when it goes

1389
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:20,000
near

1390
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:21,760
this sodium cluster salt living fluid

1391
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,920
living base this trace mineral living

1392
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:25,119
base that that harbors like a solar

1393
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:28,960
system around

1394
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:32,240
the sodium in celery

1395
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:35,520
when this little solar system

1396
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:37,520
there's thousands of these solar systems

1397
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:40,880
inside your celery juice

1398
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:43,520
thousands thousands

1399
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:45,680
so when that solar system runs across a

1400
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:48,079
pathogen

1401
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:49,760
it kills it it starts to break it down

1402
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:50,480
it starts to destroy it starts to weaken

1403
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:54,160
it

1404
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:56,079
celery juice kills

1405
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:58,960
that's what's incredible and what's

1406
00:51:56,079 --> 00:52:01,440
better is it kills for you

1407
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:05,359
that's what it does there's a membrane

1408
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:07,359
on the pathogen right there

1409
00:52:05,359 --> 00:52:08,720
and it's these little tiny things right

1410
00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:10,319
there you see these things the membrane

1411
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:10,880
it's a slipcover like a pillowcase you

1412
00:52:10,319 --> 00:52:13,599
guys

1413
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:15,200
imagine your pillowcase right over your

1414
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:18,640
pillow

1415
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:21,040
that pillowcase is your pillow's

1416
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:22,230
protector right protects the pillow the

1417
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:24,000
pillow can stay clean

1418
00:52:22,230 --> 00:52:25,680
[Music]

1419
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,280
your pillowcase gets dirty you wash your

1420
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:29,680
pillowcase because your pillowcase gets

1421
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,680
dirty

1422
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:35,760
well the virus and the pathogens

1423
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:37,440
all have a membrane a slip cover around

1424
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:39,520
it like a pillowcase cover

1425
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:42,480
and it keeps it safe just like your

1426
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:45,119
pillowcase keeps your pillow safe

1427
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:46,079
and that membrane starts to break down

1428
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:47,760
and dissolves

1429
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:50,480
when it runs across that's the pathogen

1430
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:54,000
right here when it runs across

1431
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:57,040
the sodium cluster dissolves right there

1432
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:58,160
i mean isn't that like incredible what

1433
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:00,240
it does

1434
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:02,480
deb says i've been drinking celery juice

1435
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:05,440
daily for nine months and have healed

1436
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:06,800
chronic tendinitis and vertigo is that

1437
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:10,079
worth it

1438
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:12,559
like does somebody want tendonitis

1439
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:15,200
no right no way it's brutal somebody

1440
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:18,720
want tendonitis somebody want

1441
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:21,040
vertigo no it's brutal nobody wants that

1442
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:21,760
and celery juice turn that around for

1443
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:25,680
you

1444
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:27,760
what's that worth um the juicer is 82

1445
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:29,440
off when i think about i have a friend

1446
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:32,160

00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:33,119
a friend that's sick and my friend's

1448
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:36,400
addictions

stop my friend from healing right

1450
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:39,520
my friend has a lot of food addictions

1451
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:43,280
can't break the fats

1452
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:45,920
at all um you know i still love them

1453
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:46,480
i still love them you know i'm not gonna

1454
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:47,839
hate them

1455
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:49,200
i'm still gonna love them and be like

1456
00:53:47,839 --> 00:53:49,839
man it's hard to break those food

1457
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:52,160
addictions

1458
00:53:49,839 --> 00:53:53,359
my friends got all the food addictions

1459
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:56,800
right

1460
00:53:53,359 --> 00:53:58,880
and the whole bit

help i tell him what to do

1464
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:06,559
he says i can't do it my addictions are

1465
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:06,559
too much

1466
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:11,359
and i'm like get a juicer and he's like

1467
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:12,640
get a juicer because you've got to do

1468
00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:14,319
celery juice

1469
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:16,480
i can't spend the money i can't spend

1470
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:18,720
the money i can't spend the money

1471
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:20,880
i need my money for other things i'm

1472
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:22,559
like look

1473
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:24,480
bill says i was juicing every morning

1474
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:25,920
for about a month and i started to

1475
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:29,680
develop age spots

1476
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:32,480
on my face not a disbeliever

1477
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:33,920
want to find out why my body reacted

1478
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:35,839
that way

1479
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:39,200
bill it's not the juicing that does that

1480
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:41,119
it's they were coming anyway

1481
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:43,359
coming anyway your celery juice is

1482
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:45,599
working on other things inside your body

1483
00:54:43,359 --> 00:54:47,040
right it's working on everything it's

1484
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:48,799
working on cleaning out these kidney

1485
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:50,960
stones i'm talking about it's work

1486
00:54:48,799 --> 00:54:52,720
it's working on restoring your adrenals

1487
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:53,520
it's killing off pathogens inside your

1488
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:55,040
body

1489
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:58,079
so your celery juice is doing all this

1490
00:54:55,040 --> 00:55:00,640
work it's cleaning up a dirty liver

1491
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:02,799
it's doing all this stuff but those age

1492
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:05,040
spots would have been a lot worse

1493
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:06,960
i've said that to people in the past

1494
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:08,079
don't do celery juice and watch how bad

1495
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:10,319
they get

1496
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:11,680
would be a lot worse don't do celery

1497
00:55:10,319 --> 00:55:12,400
juice and people's other problems get a

1498
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:14,559
lot worse

1499
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:16,559
and would have been a lot worse people

1500
00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:18,559
already have

1501
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:20,640
a whole bunch of stuff coming on their

1502
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:21,119
way they got a track record of all this

1503
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:24,480
that's in their system and all these

1504
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:25,440
things that have happened and all the

1505
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:27,280
bad foods

1506
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:29,040
and all everything else they got a track

1507
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:31,119
record of it

1508
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:32,839
lots of bad meals lots of all kinds of

1509
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:35,920
stuff lots of eggs

1510
00:55:32,839 --> 00:55:38,480
like you know what happens is

1511
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:39,760
people are eating a lot of eggs all

1512
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:41,200
through the years

1513
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:42,880
and then they do caffeine and they're

1514
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:44,400
doing caffeine too and then they're

1515
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:45,680
doing chocolate yeah they might have

1516
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:48,319
chocolate just once in a while

1517
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:49,760
but that chocolate once in a while what

1518
00:55:48,319 --> 00:55:52,079
happens is that caffeine in that

1519
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:55,119
chocolate is what brings about age spots

1520
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:55,839
then they got chemicals they got cologne

1521
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:59,200
perfume

1522
00:55:55,839 --> 00:56:00,559
in their life they got scented candles

1523
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:02,880
they get all kinds of stuff they get

1524
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:04,559
exposed to and then those age spots are

1525
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:06,079
on their way because caffeine is the big

1526
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:08,079
age spot cause or

1527
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:09,920
it's one of the big ones they got it on

1528
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:10,960
the way thank god you're doing celery

1529
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:12,480
juice bill

1530
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:14,319
because then main spots would have been

1531
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:15,839
a lot worse and now you've got a chance

1532
00:56:14,319 --> 00:56:17,280
of getting those age spots cleaned up

1533
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:20,240
down the road too

1534
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:22,799
ernest says age spots can go away just

1535
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:24,799
continue drinking your cj

1536
00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:27,200
it's really good advice incredible

1537
00:56:24,799 --> 00:56:27,200
advice

1538
00:56:27,359 --> 00:56:33,280
i would i would definitely

1539
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:34,720
stay away from eggs if you guys can i

1540
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:36,240
would stay with my caffeine i understand

1541
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:39,280
everybody has a caffeine

1542
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:39,280
um totally get it

1543
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:45,119
angel says my age spots have failed

1544
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:49,920
since

1545
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:49,920
juicing celery so

1546
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:54,799
oh faded so they faded since juicing

1547
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:58,079
celery

1548
00:56:54,799 --> 00:56:59,599
typos are funny so yeah

1549
00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:02,400
okay so let's go back into a little bit

1550
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:03,520
adrenal talk for a couple minutes but

1551
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:05,839
and before i go in there i'm talking

1552
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:06,559
about like why juice celery why'd you

1553
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:07,839
celery

1554
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:10,079
i've heard that before of the time

1555
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:11,040
ernest says my age spot on my nose

1556
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:13,200
disappeared

1557
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:15,359
i was blown away drinking your celery

1558
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:18,400
juice incredible

1559
00:57:15,359 --> 00:57:19,920
so i look at the celery juicer as a

1560
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:22,559
medical device

1561
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:23,119
that's that's different than other

1562
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:24,960
juicers

1563
00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:27,599
all juicers are a medical device i look

1564
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:30,720
at it that way okay totally on that

1565
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:33,760
um but yeah

1566
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:36,880
vimala says

1567
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:38,880
robinson ka i'm just a very well

1568
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:41,200

methods i have nothing against him

1570
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:44,640
except for his tone of voice is super

1571
00:57:43,839 --> 00:57:48,400
nasty

1572
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:48,400

01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:22,240

anybody know

1648
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:27,520
cara says aw is not a money grabber he's

1649
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:28,079
still beyond generous with his

1650
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:29,920
information

1651
01:00:28,079 --> 01:00:32,400
and time i think i know the person's

1652
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:35,920
phone number it's 666 the

1653
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:38,160
the i think it's 666 right is that

1654
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:40,240
is that the person's phone number that

1655
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:43,280
said i'm a money hungry grabber

1656
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:45,599
wait they're answering hey hey

1657
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:47,440
thanks for watching you don't like the

1658
01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:49,680
tone of my voice

1659
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:51,200
what do you want me to do it's my voice

1660
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:52,880
you want me to change my voice

1661
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:54,000
so you're just basically discriminating

1662
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:56,160
against me because you don't like the

1663
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:58,799
way i sound

1664
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:59,920
are you you're just are you that

1665
01:00:58,799 --> 01:01:03,119
judgmental where you

1666
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:05,599
you just i don't go around getting mad

1667
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:07,440
