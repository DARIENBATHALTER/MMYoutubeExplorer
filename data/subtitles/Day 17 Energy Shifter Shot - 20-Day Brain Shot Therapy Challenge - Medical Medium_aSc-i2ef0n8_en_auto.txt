[0.00 - 4.68] anybody who is energy deficient
[2.64 - 7.26] that's a deficiency that's happening out
[4.68 - 9.36] there people don't talk about they don't
[7.26 - 10.98] people are lined up at the coffee shops
[9.36 - 14.22] they're lined up
[10.98 - 16.20] at all of the coffee chains and they're
[14.22 - 18.06] just like getting their coffee people
[16.20 - 19.80] have their coffee going on at home they
[18.06 - 22.26] got their espressos
[19.80 - 25.50] they got their Kombucha Tea which is
[22.26 - 27.24] caffeine based almost every one of them
[25.50 - 29.34] the point is is that everybody's
[27.24 - 31.50] searching for energy but they're looking
[29.34 - 34.68] for false energy
[31.50 - 37.44] they're looking for fake energy
[34.68 - 42.42] and they're looking for stimulated
[37.44 - 45.12] energy coming from a drug source
[42.42 - 47.34] everybody is feeling malaise and
[45.12 - 49.32] listless and tired
[47.34 - 51.48] almost everybody in the world right now
[49.32 - 53.82] and the people that say I don't have any
[51.48 - 56.16] energy problems I'm not listless I'm not
[53.82 - 58.50] malazed I'm not tired I got plenty of
[56.16 - 61.20] energy and you ask them what are they
[58.50 - 62.64] doing what are they eating every day and
[61.20 - 64.92] they'll be like well I have my iced
[62.64 - 66.54] coffees I have my espressos I have my
[64.92 - 69.84] coffee in the morning
[66.54 - 72.78] and if you took that away from them
[69.84 - 74.28] they would go into withdraw
[72.78 - 77.64] and they would go into that withdrawal
[74.28 - 80.88] and they would actually be like whoa
[77.64 - 82.56] I do have an energy problem
[80.88 - 84.12] you ask them what else do you do to be
[82.56 - 86.64] like matcha
[84.12 - 88.26] tea green tea
[86.64 - 91.02] black tea
[88.26 - 96.36] they're always searching and seeking for
[91.02 - 98.46] energy from drug sources
[96.36 - 101.82] and they don't even realize it because
[98.46 - 103.38] there's a severe energy deficiency
[101.82 - 106.08] in the world
[103.38 - 108.42] anyway you guys day 17 unbelievable
[106.08 - 110.94] energy shifter is what we're doing
[108.42 - 115.26] which is incredible I use the energy
[110.94 - 118.50] shifter very much so yes I am looking
[115.26 - 121.50] for energy absolutely why I work 20
[118.50 - 123.66] hours a day yes I burn the candle at
[121.50 - 125.28] four ends you better believe it but I'm
[123.66 - 126.60] not going to use caffeine and I'm not
[125.28 - 127.92] going to use coffee or anything like
[126.60 - 130.26] that the minute I start getting a little
[127.92 - 132.72] tired the minute I start getting a
[130.26 - 134.94] little worn out because I'm a human
[132.72 - 136.92] being I totally go with the energy
[134.94 - 138.24] shifter but the energy shifters for a
[136.92 - 140.10] lot of reasons I got to talk to you
[138.24 - 143.04] about how incredible the energy shifter
[140.10 - 145.38] is we're day 17 of the medical medium
[143.04 - 147.66] brain shot therapy cleanse challenge I'm
[145.38 - 150.36] Anthony William the medical medium nice
[147.66 - 151.86] to meet you happy to know you guys this
[150.36 - 155.10] is incredible really
[151.86 - 159.48] because we're almost to the end of 20
[155.10 - 162.60] days is this even possible did we did we
[159.48 - 164.94] almost finish a 20-day brain shot
[162.60 - 166.02] therapy cleanse challenge it's insane
[164.94 - 168.90] man
[166.02 - 171.36] if you haven't done it make it a three
[168.90 - 173.04] day for you a three-day brain shot
[171.36 - 176.34] therapy cleanse challenge just three
[173.04 - 179.28] days that's all just a three day if the
[176.34 - 181.86] 20 days scared the crap out of you just
[179.28 - 183.06] do a three day download your free
[181.86 - 185.40] grocery shopping list go to
[183.06 - 188.16] medicalmedium.com and make it a three
[185.40 - 190.68] day that's it incredible
[188.16 - 192.36] why not all right so
[190.68 - 194.72] I want to read a little something so I'm
[192.36 - 197.10] going to go there now I'm in brain saver
[194.72 - 198.96] Julie Greenwood said I've done this
[197.10 - 201.30] yesterday and today tastes good and
[198.96 - 204.84] certainly increased my energy lifted my
[201.30 - 206.76] mood was fantastic Heaven Sent amazing
[204.84 - 208.02] George says I needed my chocolate every
[206.76 - 210.12] night
[208.02 - 212.46] I don't blame anybody for that you gotta
[210.12 - 214.50] realize I don't judge anybody I don't
[212.46 - 217.02] shame anybody for chocolate and matcha
[214.50 - 218.94] tea and caffeine of all sorts and coffee
[217.02 - 221.16] and iced coffees and espressos I don't I
[218.94 - 223.32] don't blame them they're doing it
[221.16 - 225.18] because they either got hooked onto it
[223.32 - 227.28] early on in life like an addiction so
[225.18 - 228.66] they're cooked hooked on the drug or
[227.28 - 231.60] they're doing it
[228.66 - 234.12] because they don't feel good brain fog
[231.60 - 236.10] focusing concentration issues all of it
[234.12 - 239.64] so they're jacked up on caffeine I don't
[236.10 - 242.28] blame people one bit nature heals on
[239.64 - 244.98] YouTube says I hated red peppers until
[242.28 - 249.12] this drink I'm really glad that you like
[244.98 - 251.16] red peppers now because I like red bell
[249.12 - 253.14] peppers too I have one right here can
[251.16 - 254.28] you see it uh on IG you probably can't
[253.14 - 255.60] see it but you guys could see it on
[254.28 - 259.26] YouTube and everywhere
[255.60 - 261.78] eurek says I stopped drinking coffee two
[259.26 - 264.54] and a quarter years ago when I started
[261.78 - 267.78] my medical medium lifestyle don't have
[264.54 - 269.04] an energy problem amazing a lot of
[267.78 - 271.26] people
[269.04 - 273.18] in the health world
[271.26 - 274.86] quit their coffee because of medical
[273.18 - 278.58] medium information
[274.86 - 282.24] I was blasted for going against the
[278.58 - 285.66] matcha tea and the green tea blasted for
[282.24 - 287.82] actually you know doing this publicly
[285.66 - 289.44] and talking about much tea and green tea
[287.82 - 292.14] and the coffee and everything else in
[289.44 - 294.84] the you guys remember you guys may not
[292.14 - 297.62] remember this but the crap I got for
[294.84 - 297.62] this right here
[298.02 - 303.48] I got my coffee honey it's organically
[300.78 - 306.18] grown it's fair trade uh roasted from
[303.48 - 310.08] the finest farmers in the finest Farms
[306.18 - 313.44] we pick our Beans by hand and then we
[310.08 - 316.08] roast them twice and we make such a fine
[313.44 - 318.26] tinted roast on our beans honey this is
[316.08 - 320.64] an incredible coffee you just picked up
[318.26 - 322.74] you know what happened was when I did
[320.64 - 324.36] that and I talked about how bad caffeine
[322.74 - 326.34] was and how it was destroying adrenal
[324.36 - 328.98] glands destroying people's brains really
[326.34 - 330.78] like causing problems wreaking havoc why
[328.98 - 332.34] people were on that caffeine the
[330.78 - 335.10] caffeine industry causing all these
[332.34 - 337.68] problems and I put out the podcast I got
[335.10 - 339.84] so much crap so much crap from the
[337.68 - 342.12] Alternative Health movement so much crap
[339.84 - 343.62] from the podcast doctors so much crap
[342.12 - 345.60] from everybody who's selling everybody
[343.62 - 347.22] and marketing stuff and affiliate stuff
[345.60 - 349.32] and all that from all those different
[347.22 - 351.78] groups of people from the mushroom
[349.32 - 354.84] coffee people to everybody the crap I
[351.78 - 357.36] got was unbelievable including
[354.84 - 359.76] censorship left and right and Boo and
[357.36 - 361.44] Bob like every everything it was crazy
[359.76 - 364.62] you guys were talking about energy today
[361.44 - 367.74] I'm kind of jacked up because I cheated
[364.62 - 369.54] on day 17.
[367.74 - 372.12] I cheated
[369.54 - 374.82] I had a cheat day so I'm gonna have to
[372.12 - 377.76] come clean with this
[374.82 - 380.34] what I had this morning was an energy
[377.76 - 382.68] sifter and I did it already today
[380.34 - 385.08] because
[382.68 - 386.64] and I'm trying to calm myself down but
[385.08 - 388.56] we're gonna do I'm gonna do another one
[386.64 - 390.54] which is really exciting and I can't
[388.56 - 391.86] wait all right all right calm down calm
[390.54 - 395.22] down calm down
[391.86 - 397.92] all right if the Bashir says I stopped
[395.22 - 400.50] all caffeine last Thursday whoa now on
[397.92 - 402.60] day seven of headaches more withdrawal
[400.50 - 404.46] is rough I rarely get headaches so
[402.60 - 408.24] assume this must be withdrawal symptoms
[404.46 - 411.00] I would probably agree ask your doctor
[408.24 - 412.44] what your doctor thinks but if that you
[411.00 - 415.20] know if that was a family member that
[412.44 - 417.36] asked me that pretty recently okay
[415.20 - 419.88] believe it or not family member asked me
[417.36 - 423.00] that who got off their caffeine and
[419.88 - 425.40] contacted me I said yes that was
[423.00 - 426.36] withdrawal creating the headache all
[425.40 - 428.58] right
[426.36 - 430.98] so I am here you guys let's read a
[428.58 - 434.24] little bit I'm excited
[430.98 - 437.70] glucose and glycogen sounds boring
[434.24 - 441.72] glucose glycogen guess what
[437.70 - 444.48] without glucose we we die that's it
[441.72 - 445.38] without glucose in our bloodstream we
[444.48 - 448.14] die
[445.38 - 451.58] so yeah it's boring as hell
[448.14 - 455.52] but it keeps Us Alive it keeps us going
[451.58 - 458.40] glucose and glycogen your brain is an
[455.52 - 460.98] organ that needs food just as much as
[458.40 - 463.68] your stomach needs it
[460.98 - 468.32] your brain relies on that food
[463.68 - 468.32] which turns into energy to function
[468.72 - 474.30] what food does your brain really need
[472.02 - 477.36] what does what does your brain need
[474.30 - 479.82] I don't get it slaughter a pig does your
[477.36 - 481.50] brain need all that fat from the pig
[479.82 - 484.26] meat
[481.50 - 486.60] does it does it need all that fat from
[484.26 - 489.06] the hog that was slaughtered
[486.60 - 490.62] is that what your brain needs kind of
[489.06 - 494.46] curious
[490.62 - 496.86] what food does your brain really need
[494.46 - 498.90] glucose
[496.86 - 501.60] it needs glucose
[498.90 - 504.54] our brain is mostly made out of glycogen
[501.60 - 509.66] that is stored glucose
[504.54 - 509.66] our brain is a glycogen ball
[512.52 - 517.56] we get our first glucose and glycogen
[515.46 - 520.62] through our mothers
[517.56 - 524.46] while we're in the womb
[520.62 - 526.86] if you put a pregnant mom on a keto diet
[524.46 - 529.32] a real keto diet
[526.86 - 531.84] and don't have any of that beautiful
[529.32 - 535.14] glucose that you need from sweet
[531.84 - 539.12] potatoes and potatoes and carrots
[535.14 - 539.12] and fruit and bananas
[539.16 - 546.56] if you put a pregnant woman
[542.16 - 546.56] on a carb-free diet
[546.78 - 551.28] the baby will be damaged
[549.42 - 554.52] if you've been a pregnant woman on a
[551.28 - 557.18] keto diet a real keto diet the baby will
[554.52 - 557.18] be damaged
[558.36 - 563.34] making a lot of friends today once again
[560.70 - 564.96] seaweed hero good to see you making lots
[563.34 - 567.90] of friends
[564.96 - 569.70] we get our first glucose and glycogen
[567.90 - 572.52] through our mothers
[569.70 - 575.30] while we're in the womb and then through
[572.52 - 575.30] breast milk
[576.48 - 583.92] breast milk is it is defined by its
[580.92 - 587.46] natural sugar content what
[583.92 - 589.86] there's sugar and breast milk huh
[587.46 - 591.90] that's impossible
[589.86 - 593.64] breast milk is defined by its natural
[591.90 - 595.32] sugar content
[593.64 - 598.80] comparatively
[595.32 - 602.22] it has little fat and protein
[598.80 - 605.18] breast milk has little fat and little
[602.22 - 605.18] protein
[606.06 - 614.34] and that bioavailable Sugar creates the
[609.96 - 617.04] building blocks of a baby's brain
[614.34 - 620.36] so when the baby's born
[617.04 - 625.56] the baby is Reliant upon
[620.36 - 628.44] glucose in the mother's breast milk
[625.56 - 631.20] that glucose in the mother's breast milk
[628.44 - 634.34] is the building blocks to the baby's
[631.20 - 634.34] brain for development
[635.46 - 642.06] if a newborn isn't able to breastfeed
[639.66 - 645.24] those beneficial sugars
[642.06 - 649.46] come a bit later from ingredients like
[645.24 - 649.46] fruits and sweet potatoes in baby food
[650.04 - 655.82] if you put a baby a newborn baby on a
[653.16 - 655.82] keto diet
[656.46 - 665.30] lacking carbs and sugar and glucose
[661.20 - 665.30] that baby will starve to death
[666.06 - 671.18] very interesting
[668.40 - 671.18] isn't it
[673.44 - 677.70] that's why formulas have sugar in them
[676.08 - 680.16] by the way
[677.70 - 682.32] so I think science realizes
[680.16 - 685.62] that the babies they tested the original
[682.32 - 689.66] formulas on that had no sugar in them
[685.62 - 689.66] probably didn't fare so good
[689.76 - 694.80] a portion of this early Glide by the way
[692.16 - 696.48] they did studies back in the 1940s and
[694.80 - 698.52] 1950s
[696.48 - 700.68] and they didn't care what happened to
[698.52 - 704.78] the babies
[700.68 - 704.78] studies were scary as
[704.88 - 709.32] they were so scary
[707.34 - 711.96] they took human beings
[709.32 - 713.94] and you signed up your baby
[711.96 - 715.68] and you thought okay no big deal I'll
[713.94 - 717.78] sign up my baby
[715.68 - 719.88] and they took babies and they did that
[717.78 - 722.76] they would give babies different diets
[719.88 - 726.00] and see what develops
[722.76 - 729.50] that's what they did back then
[726.00 - 729.50] Untold Carnage man
[729.90 - 734.28] a portion of this early glycogen which
[732.42 - 736.74] is the sugar right you guys the glucose
[734.28 - 739.68] is permanently sealed off
[736.74 - 742.10] creating actual brain tissue what does
[739.68 - 742.10] that mean
[742.74 - 747.36] developing babies
[744.90 - 750.84] are drinking the breast milk or the
[747.36 - 753.18] formula with sugar or whatever
[750.84 - 755.40] they're getting that early glucose
[753.18 - 756.84] because it's developing brain tissue but
[755.40 - 759.48] here's what it's doing that early
[756.84 - 761.88] glucose Supply and science and research
[759.48 - 764.28] doesn't know this part right here
[761.88 - 765.84] I don't have to cite my publisher said
[764.28 - 767.82] well you're not taking it from anywhere
[765.84 - 769.08] this is original unique information from
[767.82 - 771.78] above
[769.08 - 774.18] so we can't we can't have you cite
[771.78 - 776.04] anything medical medium because there's
[774.18 - 777.66] nothing soluble in here it's all
[776.04 - 780.60] original unique information in these
[777.66 - 784.20] Bibles here these eight Bibles
[780.60 - 787.08] what happens is the original sugars
[784.20 - 788.94] from the mom when the baby was in the
[787.08 - 791.04] womb
[788.94 - 793.50] are the building blocks to brain tissue
[791.04 - 795.96] then when the baby's born
[793.50 - 799.20] and the baby's breastfeeding
[795.96 - 801.48] the baby's getting more continual
[799.20 - 803.88] building blocks
[801.48 - 807.96] creating new brain tissue permanent
[803.88 - 810.96] brain tissue so a portion of the glucose
[807.96 - 813.80] turns into hardened glycogen
[810.96 - 817.70] which is the permanent brain tissue
[813.80 - 817.70] foundation for the baby
[820.98 - 825.00] those beneficial sugars come a bit later
[823.32 - 827.16] from ingredients like fruits and sweet
[825.00 - 829.20] potatoes and baby food a portion of this
[827.16 - 831.48] ready a portion of this early glycogen
[829.20 - 834.00] which is the sugars the glucose is
[831.48 - 836.28] permanently sealed off so that means
[834.00 - 838.92] that sugars from the breast milk that
[836.28 - 841.14] the baby's ingesting a portion of that
[838.92 - 843.18] goes to the brain and then becomes
[841.14 - 845.22] sealed off and becomes permanent brain
[843.18 - 846.36] tissue
[845.22 - 847.92] foreign
[846.36 - 852.02] if you don't believe it's coming from
[847.92 - 852.02] above this information then I'm a genius
[853.62 - 859.08] if you don't like thinking I talk to a
[856.50 - 861.30] voice and that's just inconceivable
[859.08 - 863.10] then I must be a genius just think I'm a
[861.30 - 866.10] genius get the information learn grow
[863.10 - 867.90] and heal get the books be it Advance
[866.10 - 869.94] with the information and heal heal your
[867.90 - 872.04] loved ones and you don't have to think I
[869.94 - 874.28] hear it from above just I'm a genius
[872.04 - 874.28] then
[876.30 - 881.16] but please cite the information back to
[878.82 - 884.06] my geniusness
[881.16 - 884.06] if you can
[885.30 - 889.20] a portion of this early glycogen is
[887.46 - 890.88] permanently sealed off creating actual
[889.20 - 892.44] brain tissue which science and research
[890.88 - 894.96] does not know
[892.44 - 898.08] stored in such a way that it will never
[894.96 - 900.60] be disturbed in the future
[898.08 - 903.54] to a degree your brain keeps adding to
[900.60 - 906.02] that foundational glycogen storage as it
[903.54 - 910.88] continues to develop through childhood
[906.02 - 910.88] teenage years and your early twenties
[911.28 - 918.36] glycogen tissue is the figurative meat
[915.12 - 921.66] on the brain's bone
[918.36 - 923.22] it's that early glycogen that's the meat
[921.66 - 925.08] on the bone
[923.22 - 927.98] that's what it is
[925.08 - 931.86] it's an original early glycogen storage
[927.98 - 934.34] that becomes the permanent resident of
[931.86 - 934.34] the brain
[934.68 - 941.16] if someone were to tear into your brain
[938.04 - 942.66] as though it were a drumstick like eat
[941.16 - 944.76] it like
[942.66 - 947.04] if they were going to do that like tear
[944.76 - 949.76] into the brain like I had a good brain
[947.04 - 949.76] abroad here
[951.00 - 954.32] they were to do that
[955.08 - 962.84] that gray matter flesh would be made
[957.96 - 962.84] from pockets of decades old glycogen
[963.54 - 969.90] it would be made from decades-old
[966.48 - 972.36] glycogen so if you were to tear into an
[969.90 - 974.58] adult's human brain
[972.36 - 978.12] and tear into that and crunch into that
[974.58 - 980.52] and eat the brain right
[978.12 - 983.16] if you were to do that
[980.52 - 984.96] you that would be old glycogen you're
[983.16 - 988.16] eating you're eating glycogen from
[984.96 - 988.16] decades ago
[991.44 - 999.00] sugars are your brain's place of origin
[996.42 - 1001.82] your brain also starts to collect
[999.00 - 1004.18] glycogen in storage bins to be used for
[1001.82 - 1004.18] fuel
[1004.52 - 1009.80] the spider web of glycogen connective
[1006.86 - 1012.74] tissue is a safe haven for new brain
[1009.80 - 1015.20] cell development it's how brain cells
[1012.74 - 1016.76] are birthed
[1015.20 - 1022.76] their birth
[1016.76 - 1022.76] in that glycogen spiderweb
[1023.36 - 1027.80] is there any fat in a healthy brain
[1025.64 - 1029.30] that's in a healthy body
[1027.80 - 1030.56] so let's talk about that a little bit
[1029.30 - 1032.84] because you'll you'll see you'll look
[1030.56 - 1035.90] into things if you're like keto science
[1032.84 - 1039.98] says our brain is made out of fat it's
[1035.90 - 1043.22] 90 fat keto says you know that our brain
[1039.98 - 1044.78] you know ancient man I love when they
[1043.22 - 1046.58] throw that ancient crap around all the
[1044.78 - 1048.44] time like anybody knew what anybody did
[1046.58 - 1049.58] in the ancient world like anybody even
[1048.44 - 1051.92] knew
[1049.58 - 1054.20] like what everybody's always like
[1051.92 - 1056.06] ancient medicine what or how about this
[1054.20 - 1057.08] one ancient Chinese medicine are you
[1056.06 - 1060.38] kidding
[1057.08 - 1062.54] they gave Emperors Mercury elixirs that
[1060.38 - 1065.06] was the medicine of the time Chinese
[1062.54 - 1068.06] medicine was Mercury you drink toxic
[1065.06 - 1070.40] heavy metal that was Chinese medicine
[1068.06 - 1073.46] and you know what else everybody thinks
[1070.40 - 1074.96] herbal medicine was everywhere Native
[1073.46 - 1077.18] Americans were using some herbal
[1074.96 - 1081.02] medicine yes but can I just say this
[1077.18 - 1083.18] Chinese medicine they used bugs
[1081.02 - 1085.52] if you go into the old Chinese medicine
[1083.18 - 1089.72] apotheses that were resembling what used
[1085.52 - 1092.60] to be it was all wings of of toads legs
[1089.72 - 1094.46] of toads wings of butterflies it was all
[1092.60 - 1096.80] like
[1094.46 - 1099.98] um it was all fish dehydrated fish
[1096.80 - 1102.92] pieces fins of fish and then it was like
[1099.98 - 1105.74] bats and bat wings and it was like bird
[1102.92 - 1111.22] feather crushed it was all of that you
[1105.74 - 1111.22] go to you go to Apothecary in China
[1112.10 - 1117.20] and back then alternate medicine and
[1114.98 - 1119.56] this happened it sent for centuries it
[1117.20 - 1123.58] was just nothing but bugs and critters
[1119.56 - 1127.52] claws of Critters claws of bugs Wings
[1123.58 - 1129.02] bones bone dust it was all of this like
[1127.52 - 1131.66] just the pocket theories were nothing
[1129.02 - 1134.18] but all of that there weren't a lot of
[1131.66 - 1137.54] herbs I'm sorry to say that that came
[1134.18 - 1140.18] from later on
[1137.54 - 1142.70] later on isn't that incredible some
[1140.18 - 1144.20] people say oh ancient it was ancient no
[1142.70 - 1147.16] not really
[1144.20 - 1147.16] not at all
[1147.38 - 1153.74] I just love when they do that Ancient
[1149.54 - 1154.94] Man ate this oh really were you there
[1153.74 - 1157.94] you know
[1154.94 - 1160.76] it is recorded though
[1157.94 - 1166.46] that that in Chinese medicine the number
[1160.76 - 1169.46] one the number one Elixir treatment and
[1166.46 - 1172.52] cure was Mercury
[1169.46 - 1174.44] Emperors went mad they were given Doses
[1172.52 - 1177.88] and doses of mercury to try to cure
[1174.44 - 1180.02] their ales that is actual
[1177.88 - 1181.52] historically true
[1180.02 - 1183.56] so I'm kind of tired when I hear this
[1181.52 - 1185.36] all the time you see on social media
[1183.56 - 1186.98] you know when I take information from
[1185.36 - 1188.66] above and it goes in these books and
[1186.98 - 1190.04] nobody never even knew anything about it
[1188.66 - 1191.90] someone would be like oh that was
[1190.04 - 1193.94] probably ancient no
[1191.90 - 1196.10] that was ancient fists this is what you
[1193.94 - 1198.50] hear it's it's insane
[1196.10 - 1201.68] is there any fat in a healthy brain
[1198.50 - 1203.78] that's in a healthy body
[1201.68 - 1205.58] yes
[1203.78 - 1206.90] it's time to research you want don't
[1205.58 - 1208.46] want to tell you that the brain is just
[1206.90 - 1210.14] made out of all fat now alternative
[1208.46 - 1213.44] medicine is like ah the brain's made out
[1210.14 - 1216.20] of fat it's all fat now oh really
[1213.44 - 1219.20] it's interesting
[1216.20 - 1221.36] yes there is extremely low levels of fat
[1219.20 - 1225.20] compared to what science and research
[1221.36 - 1225.20] theorize you ready theorize
[1225.74 - 1229.30] science and research are
[1229.96 - 1238.78] basing a theory that the brain is loaded
[1234.56 - 1238.78] with fat that's basing a theory
[1239.24 - 1243.56] is there any fat in a healthy brain
[1241.94 - 1245.90] yes
[1243.56 - 1247.46] but there's extremely low levels of fat
[1245.90 - 1250.82] compared to what science and research
[1247.46 - 1255.76] theorize the fat in the brain is a small
[1250.82 - 1255.76] fraction of the brain itself
[1256.82 - 1263.42] the fat in the brain is a small fraction
[1261.08 - 1265.88] of the brain itself that's important to
[1263.42 - 1267.74] know get ready for this
[1265.88 - 1269.96] the healthier the person's brain and
[1267.74 - 1273.08] body are the smaller the fraction of fat
[1269.96 - 1276.62] that resides inside the brain
[1273.08 - 1279.26] the healthier a person is
[1276.62 - 1282.02] the lower the amount of fat resides
[1279.26 - 1285.26] inside the brain
[1282.02 - 1287.60] the more unhealthy of the brain and body
[1285.26 - 1289.76] are the higher levels of fat that reside
[1287.60 - 1291.32] inside the brain so if someone is really
[1289.76 - 1293.18] obese
[1291.32 - 1295.54] they're going to have more fat in their
[1293.18 - 1295.54] brain
[1297.08 - 1300.80] get ready for this
[1298.94 - 1302.48] this is incredible information by the
[1300.80 - 1305.72] way
[1302.48 - 1308.78] the cadavers that medical science used
[1305.72 - 1311.30] to determine a basis for how much fat
[1308.78 - 1313.16] resides inside the brain where cadavers
[1311.30 - 1317.26] of older age
[1313.16 - 1317.26] and of the poorest health
[1318.20 - 1323.96] the cadaver's brains were atrophied and
[1321.62 - 1325.88] what was replacing the atrophy were fat
[1323.96 - 1327.98] deposits here you ever eat chicken
[1325.88 - 1329.42] before have you ever eaten did you ever
[1327.98 - 1332.66] eat chicken
[1329.42 - 1336.28] did you ever buy a roasted chicken
[1332.66 - 1336.28] did you ever eat a roasted chicken
[1336.44 - 1340.64] this is super Advanced information right
[1338.54 - 1342.44] here by the way
[1340.64 - 1343.94] from above super Advanced information
[1342.44 - 1345.92] it's in the brain saver book you really
[1343.94 - 1348.70] should get these brand saver books page
[1345.92 - 1348.70] number 412
[1348.86 - 1354.92] have you ever eaten a roasted chicken
[1353.00 - 1356.48] do you ever find those fatty deposits in
[1354.92 - 1359.24] the roasted chicken
[1356.48 - 1361.16] those yellow yellowy strands of fat
[1359.24 - 1364.16] deposits
[1361.16 - 1368.44] the more unhealthy the chicken was and
[1364.16 - 1368.44] raised the more the fat deposits were
[1368.72 - 1373.22] if you purchased a regular conventional
[1370.82 - 1374.90] chicken that was caged up and fed all
[1373.22 - 1378.08] this crap
[1374.90 - 1379.94] and got it nice and plump and you cut
[1378.08 - 1382.40] open that roasted chicken and you ate
[1379.94 - 1386.84] that roasted chicken like yum
[1382.40 - 1388.34] you would find a lot more of the yellowy
[1386.84 - 1391.10] hunks
[1388.34 - 1392.72] of fatty deposits all throughout the
[1391.10 - 1394.76] chicken
[1392.72 - 1396.62] but guess what you don't see the
[1394.76 - 1398.36] chicken's brain
[1396.62 - 1401.44] because the chicken's heads are cut off
[1398.36 - 1401.44] by the machines right
[1401.72 - 1406.76] so those heads just get discarded
[1404.78 - 1409.10] probably ground up and thrown into dog
[1406.76 - 1412.58] food or whatever
[1409.10 - 1416.06] canned dog food the point is is those
[1412.58 - 1419.06] chickens brains were filled with fat
[1416.06 - 1420.92] the unhealthier that the chicken is
[1419.06 - 1422.72] the more the brain of the chicken is
[1420.92 - 1425.24] filled with fat
[1422.72 - 1427.94] just like the chicken itself and then
[1425.24 - 1430.94] when you eat a lean bird maybe a wild
[1427.94 - 1432.80] bird what about wild pheasant
[1430.94 - 1435.20] Wild Quail
[1432.80 - 1438.56] Partridge if you've ever eaten a wild
[1435.20 - 1440.42] Partridge you can't find fat on the
[1438.56 - 1442.52] Partridge
[1440.42 - 1444.80] you can go through the Partridge and be
[1442.52 - 1446.30] like this Partridge is good and eat it
[1444.80 - 1449.06] right down to the bone
[1446.30 - 1452.56] and you won't find a lot of fat on a on
[1449.06 - 1452.56] a partridge that's caught in the wild
[1453.20 - 1457.88] so what they did what science and and
[1455.42 - 1460.16] research did
[1457.88 - 1463.64] was when they were looking at brains
[1460.16 - 1468.32] back years ago to look for a composition
[1463.64 - 1471.62] they were picking old people that died
[1468.32 - 1474.32] old obese people that died
[1471.62 - 1477.20] their brains had fat deposits riddled
[1474.32 - 1479.12] all around the brain in and around the
[1477.20 - 1482.06] cavities including inside the cavity
[1479.12 - 1484.40] where that gaping hole opens up inside
[1482.06 - 1486.68] the middle of the brain as the brain
[1484.40 - 1489.02] atrophies as people get older and
[1486.68 - 1492.04] healthier and unhealthier and their
[1489.02 - 1492.04] brain starts to die
[1492.70 - 1498.64] they tested brains that were old
[1498.80 - 1504.14] and decaying and atrophy and filled with
[1501.98 - 1505.88] fat
[1504.14 - 1508.64] they didn't take
[1505.88 - 1510.44] a 20 year old's brain who was eating
[1508.64 - 1513.46] healthy
[1510.44 - 1513.46] and use that
[1513.50 - 1519.32] back in the 1940s they took somebody
[1516.20 - 1521.30] very obese who died a terrible death of
[1519.32 - 1523.76] sickness and illness whose brain was
[1521.30 - 1526.94] atrophying they cut that cadaver open
[1523.76 - 1530.20] and they took that person's brain
[1526.94 - 1530.20] and that's what they did
[1533.84 - 1537.68] should I have taken the energy shifter
[1535.82 - 1539.54] first like I did because I did an energy
[1537.68 - 1542.54] shifter first and I flexibly wound up
[1539.54 - 1544.28] Ava says Ava Sheridan says Oh wow was
[1542.54 - 1546.08] wondering why it was so hard to
[1544.28 - 1548.90] determine how much fat was in a brain
[1546.08 - 1551.12] not studying healthy brains
[1548.90 - 1555.50] they don't study brains anymore for fat
[1551.12 - 1557.48] versus not fat this was done in the 40s
[1555.50 - 1560.06] they did that they concluded their
[1557.48 - 1563.36] science in 1940.
[1560.06 - 1565.58] they took old deceased people who had
[1563.36 - 1569.00] atrophy and they were overweight totally
[1565.58 - 1570.68] obese in 1940. that's who they used as
[1569.00 - 1572.18] the cadavers they don't even they don't
[1570.68 - 1573.50] even check anybody's brains for fat
[1572.18 - 1575.54] anymore
[1573.50 - 1577.46] now because people are so much on the
[1575.54 - 1579.32] fat diet and everything oh healthy fat
[1577.46 - 1582.64] they just assume oh they're Brands made
[1579.32 - 1582.64] out of fat sounds like a good one
[1582.92 - 1586.82] and nowadays people are really unhealthy
[1585.14 - 1588.02] and children are getting more fat in
[1586.82 - 1589.58] their brains than they ever did before
[1588.02 - 1590.90] everybody's getting more fat in their
[1589.58 - 1593.36] brains than they ever did before it's
[1590.90 - 1595.34] like that bad roasted chicken from a
[1593.36 - 1597.32] conventional farm that was pumped up
[1595.34 - 1600.98] with all kinds of stuff and fed all
[1597.32 - 1602.96] kinds of bad food and bad feed
[1600.98 - 1604.76] and you don't see that chicken's brain
[1602.96 - 1606.26] they cut it off they cut that chicken's
[1604.76 - 1608.48] head off that chicken's head off went
[1606.26 - 1610.76] into the basket and that was it
[1608.48 - 1613.24] gone went down the chute
[1610.76 - 1616.52] that chicken's brain was filled with fat
[1613.24 - 1618.86] they don't study chicken fat and brains
[1616.52 - 1621.02] like they don't take animals and say
[1618.86 - 1622.58] well this animal came from somebody's
[1621.02 - 1624.56] backyard that was big that was feeding
[1622.58 - 1626.72] off of bugs and lettuce and we're gonna
[1624.56 - 1628.40] check that chicken Sprain and then we're
[1626.72 - 1631.10] gonna check it compared to this old
[1628.40 - 1633.62] chicken that was like fed all this
[1631.10 - 1635.90] garbage and crap
[1633.62 - 1637.88] they don't even do that science just
[1635.90 - 1640.16] lets everybody down they never do
[1637.88 - 1642.52] anything right with practically almost
[1640.16 - 1642.52] everything
[1646.58 - 1650.84] brains were atrophied and what was
[1648.62 - 1653.60] replacing the atrophy were fat deposits
[1650.84 - 1655.82] and and the cadavers they used fat repl
[1653.60 - 1657.74] here's when you age and you're not
[1655.82 - 1659.72] taking care of your brain
[1657.74 - 1662.36] and you're obese
[1659.72 - 1664.58] it happens this life is hard
[1662.36 - 1665.90] and and you're not taught to take care
[1664.58 - 1667.10] of yourself maybe you don't have the
[1665.90 - 1669.08] resources you're just having really
[1667.10 - 1671.72] difficult time in life and if you're
[1669.08 - 1673.46] older you're obese your brain's
[1671.72 - 1677.36] atrophying
[1673.46 - 1679.70] there's a lot more fat inside the brain
[1677.36 - 1681.68] and even if you're not obese there's
[1679.70 - 1683.90] more fat inside people's brains now than
[1681.68 - 1686.78] ever before because of unhealthy brains
[1683.90 - 1690.40] but regardless there's still a fraction
[1686.78 - 1690.40] of fat compared to not
[1691.28 - 1696.20] neuro ion says can people be absolutely
[1694.16 - 1697.58] healthy and still have some fat beneath
[1696.20 - 1699.98] the skin
[1697.58 - 1703.16] we all have a little bit of fat inside
[1699.98 - 1706.52] of us absolutely naturally occurring
[1703.16 - 1709.70] it's not about not having a scrap of fat
[1706.52 - 1711.62] inside the body that's not it but yes
[1709.70 - 1713.96] there's healthy levels of fat that
[1711.62 - 1717.20] people have inside you know their body
[1713.96 - 1720.44] but got to keep in mind
[1717.20 - 1723.46] a fatty liver is really bad
[1720.44 - 1723.46] that's bad
[1723.74 - 1727.64] and that's important to know that gives
[1725.72 - 1730.96] you a window on how it's not good to
[1727.64 - 1730.96] have fat inside our body it's true
[1732.44 - 1738.10] it isn't 60 of the brain made out of fat
[1735.14 - 1738.10] it's much lower
[1739.40 - 1744.86] it's not 60 percent
[1741.44 - 1746.48] it's supposed to be much much lower
[1744.86 - 1748.76] so let's talk about this a little bit
[1746.48 - 1750.26] the fat inside the brain of a healthy
[1748.76 - 1752.78] person should be roughly the same
[1750.26 - 1755.80] percentage of fat as in every organ in
[1752.78 - 1755.80] the body did you hear that part
[1758.00 - 1762.86] that's important right there that alone
[1760.88 - 1765.50] Bethpage says can you be skinny and have
[1762.86 - 1768.32] a fatty brain yes because you could have
[1765.50 - 1770.84] a fatty liver and be skinny
[1768.32 - 1772.94] you can have a toxic overburdened
[1770.84 - 1775.46] fatty liver
[1772.94 - 1778.72] and have too much fat occurring in the
[1775.46 - 1778.72] brain that you're not supposed to have
[1778.76 - 1782.18] the fat inside the brain of a healthy
[1780.80 - 1784.16] person should be roughly the same
[1782.18 - 1785.84] percentage of fat as in every other
[1784.16 - 1788.18] organ in the body just like when
[1785.84 - 1790.22] someone's liver becomes unhealthy and
[1788.18 - 1792.86] starts to take on additional fat and
[1790.22 - 1795.26] becomes a fatty liver your brain can
[1792.86 - 1797.92] take on additional fat and become a
[1795.26 - 1797.92] fatty brain
[1801.50 - 1807.44] the brain can do the same becoming an
[1804.50 - 1811.12] unhealthy brain that takes on additional
[1807.44 - 1813.50] fat and becomes a fatty brain
[1811.12 - 1816.14] instead of Medical Science understanding
[1813.50 - 1818.00] that the same thing that occurs to the
[1816.14 - 1819.80] liver can happen to the brain they
[1818.00 - 1822.80] theorize that the brain is supposed to
[1819.80 - 1825.56] have that much more additional fat
[1822.80 - 1827.66] in truth a healthy 20 year old in good
[1825.56 - 1830.24] shape does not have a brain that's made
[1827.66 - 1833.26] of sixty percent fat
[1830.24 - 1833.26] why is that
[1835.94 - 1841.34] the roughly 60 percent fat inside the
[1838.94 - 1842.90] brain that medical research and science
[1841.34 - 1846.26] claim
[1842.90 - 1849.44] is not all omegas
[1846.26 - 1851.12] so here's the real trick of the trade
[1849.44 - 1854.78] out there of science and research and
[1851.12 - 1856.94] alternative science right
[1854.78 - 1859.04] healthy fats healthy fats good for your
[1856.94 - 1860.90] brain all omega-3 your brain's made out
[1859.04 - 1863.24] of fat your brain's made out of fat your
[1860.90 - 1865.82] brain's not not made out of
[1863.24 - 1868.28] Omega-3 your brain fat isn't made out of
[1865.82 - 1870.86] Omega-3
[1868.28 - 1874.90] there's microscopic amounts of Omega-3
[1870.86 - 1874.90] in the brain yes and that's healthy
[1875.02 - 1882.32] small small deposits of Omega-3 the fat
[1879.32 - 1886.96] people get in their brain creating a
[1882.32 - 1886.96] fatty brain isn't Omega-3
[1891.32 - 1896.36] the roughly 60 percent
[1894.14 - 1899.86] of fat inside the brain that medical
[1896.36 - 1899.86] research and science claim
[1900.92 - 1905.72] it's not all omegas
[1903.68 - 1908.92] the fat that accumulates in the brain is
[1905.72 - 1908.92] the same as the fat
[1909.62 - 1916.34] that's in a sick liver
[1913.22 - 1919.04] which is also not all omegas and that's
[1916.34 - 1921.62] what's interesting oh omega-3s
[1919.04 - 1924.50] gotta get your omegas your brain needs
[1921.62 - 1926.42] your omegas they need those Omega-3s oh
[1924.50 - 1928.82] you got a fatty liver oh you must have
[1926.42 - 1932.86] too much omega-3 inside your liver
[1928.82 - 1932.86] no it's not Omega-3
[1934.22 - 1939.32] it's garbage fat
[1936.92 - 1940.10] that's inside your liver it's garbage
[1939.32 - 1941.66] fat
[1940.10 - 1943.46] oh your brain
[1941.66 - 1945.14] your brain's got a lot of fat in there
[1943.46 - 1946.58] oh it must be all Omega-3s are you
[1945.14 - 1948.08] kidding me your brain's not filled with
[1946.58 - 1952.06] omega-3s
[1948.08 - 1952.06] your brain has garbage fat in it
[1952.46 - 1957.76] why am I yelling
[1954.44 - 1957.76] why am I so loud today
[1958.10 - 1962.66] the fat that accumulates in the brain is
[1960.20 - 1965.96] the same as the fat that's in a sick
[1962.66 - 1967.46] liver which is also not all omegas
[1965.96 - 1970.72] when people have effect when you get
[1967.46 - 1970.72] diagnosed with a fatty liver
[1972.32 - 1974.96] you're in the waiting room you're
[1973.58 - 1977.78] waiting for your diagnosis the doctor
[1974.96 - 1979.94] wants to come in and see you
[1977.78 - 1982.46] the internist wants to come come and see
[1979.94 - 1986.80] the GP wants to come and see you
[1982.46 - 1986.80] well I have something to tell you sir
[1988.94 - 1991.84] Mrs Johnson
[1992.00 - 1995.78] I want to talk to you about your
[1993.62 - 1998.36] diagnosis here from what it looks like
[1995.78 - 2000.88] from all our blood work and
[1998.36 - 2003.34] and the biopsy we did also on your liver
[2000.88 - 2006.76] sorry about that
[2003.34 - 2009.00] it looks like ma'am you have a fatty
[2006.76 - 2009.00] liver
[2010.06 - 2012.66] foreign
[2013.48 - 2018.04] no it's not Omega-3
[2015.88 - 2019.84] what is it it's garbage fat
[2018.04 - 2022.62] same thing in the brain
[2019.84 - 2022.62] garbage truck
[2024.82 - 2029.08] the fat that accumulates in the brain is
[2027.22 - 2031.66] the same as the fat that accumulates in
[2029.08 - 2034.48] a sick liver but they're not diagnosing
[2031.66 - 2036.76] a fatty brain it's medical medium
[2034.48 - 2039.34] information they're not they're not
[2036.76 - 2042.96] diagnosing fatty brain out there
[2039.34 - 2042.96] they'll say fatty liver
[2044.14 - 2049.18] they'll say fatty liver but they won't
[2045.88 - 2052.72] say fatty brain instead they will accept
[2049.18 - 2054.76] the higher levels of brain fat that are
[2052.72 - 2057.16] happening in people's unhealthy bodies
[2054.76 - 2059.08] they're getting fatty livers even if
[2057.16 - 2061.50] they're skinny and they're getting fatty
[2059.08 - 2061.50] brains
[2061.84 - 2065.88] I'm Dr Wiggy woggy here
[2066.64 - 2071.02] fatty liver
[2068.44 - 2073.66] excuse me what's your question
[2071.02 - 2076.12] your question is it must be all Omega-3s
[2073.66 - 2078.64] I don't know
[2076.12 - 2081.40] I'm just thinking fat is good good is
[2078.64 - 2083.44] fat good Fat's good you can eat more
[2081.40 - 2085.66] avocados and nuts and seeds and get all
[2083.44 - 2087.58] the omegas you want
[2085.66 - 2089.56] but I'm wondering maybe that might make
[2087.58 - 2091.78] your liver fatter
[2089.56 - 2093.40] I don't know is your brain filled with
[2091.78 - 2095.68] fat
[2093.40 - 2097.36] the fat that accumulates in the brain is
[2095.68 - 2100.36] the same is the fat that's in a sick
[2097.36 - 2102.28] liver which is also not all omegas guess
[2100.36 - 2103.96] what news flash
[2102.28 - 2105.70] to all doctors
[2103.96 - 2109.02] it's not a megas
[2105.70 - 2109.02] it's not omega-3s
[2109.36 - 2112.96] that person with the fatty liver doesn't
[2111.34 - 2114.82] have a fatty liver because it's filled
[2112.96 - 2116.20] with Omega-3s that person with a fatty
[2114.82 - 2118.36] brain which they don't even know they
[2116.20 - 2120.90] have a fatty brain is not filled with
[2118.36 - 2120.90] omega-3s
[2122.56 - 2129.10] it's fatty deposits of what
[2125.98 - 2131.50] Spirit of compassion used for a word
[2129.10 - 2134.20] because
[2131.50 - 2136.96] when when the information is being
[2134.20 - 2140.20] messaged from me into these books after
[2136.96 - 2141.22] hearing the words I have to use soc's
[2140.20 - 2143.56] word
[2141.22 - 2147.96] which is its fatty deposits of
[2143.56 - 2147.96] unproductive fat I call it garbage fat
[2148.96 - 2155.98] are there omegas inside a healthy brain
[2152.86 - 2159.28] yes there are
[2155.98 - 2160.66] do they play a role question mark yes
[2159.28 - 2163.00] they do
[2160.66 - 2165.28] I'm reading from brain saver
[2163.00 - 2167.32] page 412
[2165.28 - 2169.60] you gotta have the books get the books
[2167.32 - 2171.52] tell everybody about the books
[2169.60 - 2173.32] if they can't afford they're on sale at
[2171.52 - 2177.46] amazon.com us right now if they can't
[2173.32 - 2179.86] afford it uh for this the book on sale
[2177.46 - 2180.82] which is incredible both books are on
[2179.86 - 2182.98] sale
[2180.82 - 2186.28] then go to the library get it for free
[2182.98 - 2190.26] if you can but they're 42 off and 50 off
[2186.28 - 2190.26] on amazon.com right now it's insane
[2191.56 - 2195.94] just a forewarning
[2193.36 - 2197.62] your mind is going to be blown
[2195.94 - 2200.38] can you handle it
[2197.62 - 2202.06] that's the question because
[2200.38 - 2203.86] the information just the blood draw
[2202.06 - 2206.02] chapter alone just the eating disorder
[2203.86 - 2208.36] chapter alone just the OCD chapter alone
[2206.02 - 2211.00] like I can't even tell you these books
[2208.36 - 2213.22] are unbelievable it was one big book and
[2211.00 - 2215.34] now it's two big books had to be cut in
[2213.22 - 2215.34] half
[2215.50 - 2218.50] foreign
[2222.40 - 2226.84] energy shifter today I'm looking forward
[2224.98 - 2228.10] to another energy shifter I had one this
[2226.84 - 2231.22] morning
[2228.10 - 2232.78] are there omegas inside a healthy brain
[2231.22 - 2235.44] question mark
[2232.78 - 2235.44] yes
[2236.74 - 2240.76] do they play a role question mark yes
[2239.02 - 2244.24] they do
[2240.76 - 2246.58] it's a small role
[2244.24 - 2249.10] the role these Trace omegas play inside
[2246.58 - 2252.70] the brain is the same role they play
[2249.10 - 2255.04] inside all organs inside the body
[2252.70 - 2258.42] since when did they totally screw
[2255.04 - 2258.42] everybody over with this one
[2260.14 - 2264.22] they made like
[2262.12 - 2268.44] omega-3s
[2264.22 - 2268.44] and omegas were critical for the brain
[2268.66 - 2275.28] But the irony is it's critical in its
[2271.60 - 2275.28] small role for every part of the body
[2275.68 - 2279.76] Omega-3s in the same way that liver
[2277.72 - 2281.74] needs the omega-3 the spleen needs
[2279.76 - 2283.90] omega-3 your pancreas needs the omega-3
[2281.74 - 2285.88] your brain needs it your heart needs the
[2283.90 - 2287.20] omega-3 the same way but for some reason
[2285.88 - 2288.70] they centered it all on the brain
[2287.20 - 2291.10] because it was like
[2288.70 - 2293.56] a way to
[2291.10 - 2296.70] BS more and more people like they knew
[2293.56 - 2296.70] brain science or something
[2298.12 - 2302.02] you wake up one morning and you have
[2300.10 - 2304.12] really bad brain fog and you can't think
[2302.02 - 2305.74] and you're walking around and you feel
[2304.12 - 2307.30] like you're going insane and you go to
[2305.74 - 2308.62] the neurologist and the doctorates of
[2307.30 - 2311.32] the neurologist another doctor and
[2308.62 - 2313.06] everything you'll see how fast brain
[2311.32 - 2315.28] science really works
[2313.06 - 2318.06] you'll see what brain science even is
[2315.28 - 2318.06] it's
[2318.34 - 2324.22] ma'am we did an MRI everything looks
[2320.86 - 2326.32] okay uh maybe you just need a rest
[2324.22 - 2327.40] you're overworking oh you're not working
[2326.32 - 2330.40] that hard
[2327.40 - 2332.62] um let's see brain science brain science
[2330.40 - 2334.66] all the trillions of dollars so-called
[2332.62 - 2336.70] going into brain science uh ma'am you
[2334.66 - 2338.92] have let's see you have brain fog it
[2336.70 - 2341.02] feels foggy you you focus and
[2338.92 - 2342.58] concentration issues
[2341.02 - 2345.58] um you have a hard time understanding
[2342.58 - 2349.12] what I'm saying or speaking hmm we
[2345.58 - 2351.40] didn't MRI hmm we did blood work hmm
[2349.12 - 2353.26] maybe you need more healthy fats because
[2351.40 - 2355.42] that's what this article says over here
[2353.26 - 2357.58] when I look online in this article maybe
[2355.42 - 2359.38] you need Omega-3s ma'am you'll see how
[2357.58 - 2361.56] fast brain science works when you get
[2359.38 - 2361.56] sick
[2362.40 - 2366.22] says every sentence of this book is
[2364.60 - 2367.48] mind-blowing
[2366.22 - 2369.76] is
[2367.48 - 2372.04] it's filled with so much important
[2369.76 - 2374.26] information this book is the most
[2372.04 - 2376.54] important book of our time fill the true
[2374.26 - 2379.42] answers to our elements
[2376.54 - 2380.90] in the antidotes to heal us and the
[2379.42 - 2384.02] antidotes to heal us
[2380.90 - 2384.02] [Music]
[2385.96 - 2389.92] the role these trace minerals play
[2387.82 - 2392.98] inside the brain is the same role they
[2389.92 - 2396.94] play inside all organs in the body they
[2392.98 - 2399.94] act as insulation for cold temperatures
[2396.94 - 2399.94] boom
[2400.06 - 2404.08] research in science had no idea that
[2402.64 - 2407.20] omega-3s
[2404.08 - 2410.26] are an insulator for the entire body
[2407.20 - 2412.36] from cold temperatures
[2410.26 - 2415.96] that's Advanced Medical information
[2412.36 - 2418.18] right here from above in the book
[2415.96 - 2421.60] two years from now you'll be hearing it
[2418.18 - 2424.98] out there as they thief and theft and
[2421.60 - 2424.98] take and steal and poach this
[2429.76 - 2433.80] maybe next week at this rate
[2434.80 - 2440.56] omegas inside all organs including
[2437.56 - 2442.90] inside the brain are there to act as a
[2440.56 - 2445.24] mild barrier inhibiting the body from
[2442.90 - 2447.70] going into shock too fast from cold
[2445.24 - 2450.10] temperatures
[2447.70 - 2452.38] nobody knows and medical research and
[2450.10 - 2455.62] science alternative science none of it
[2452.38 - 2457.66] knows that the omegas are in every organ
[2455.62 - 2460.06] they're there
[2457.66 - 2461.86] to inhibit shock
[2460.06 - 2465.12] from drastic cold temperatures that
[2461.86 - 2465.12] happen really quickly in someone
[2467.68 - 2474.76] say Laura says I'm 5'9 and about 115
[2472.42 - 2478.38] pounds and have so many conditions and
[2474.76 - 2478.38] symptoms of a fatty liver
[2479.26 - 2483.76] and yet glorifying the importance of
[2481.36 - 2487.36] fats for the brain doesn't save us
[2483.76 - 2490.36] for the brain fats are a small tool with
[2487.36 - 2492.70] a relatively small purpose compared to
[2490.36 - 2496.02] the major significance of Sugar's role
[2492.70 - 2496.02] in keeping you alive
[2496.32 - 2500.74] the role that Sugar plays in the brain
[2499.12 - 2504.76] is monumental
[2500.74 - 2506.08] compared to the significance of fats
[2504.76 - 2508.36] for one
[2506.08 - 2510.40] there's that glycogen storage acquired
[2508.36 - 2512.02] in baby hood that I talk about before if
[2510.40 - 2513.94] you hop down here now
[2512.02 - 2517.50] on this live please go back to the
[2513.94 - 2517.50] beginning sometime when it's posted
[2517.78 - 2524.14] for one there's that glycogen storage
[2521.02 - 2526.42] acquired in babyhood childhood in young
[2524.14 - 2529.00] adulthood that keeps the brain healthy
[2526.42 - 2531.64] and prevents atrophy
[2529.00 - 2534.84] being starved of glucose for too long
[2531.64 - 2534.84] shrinks the brain
[2535.06 - 2538.54] it's one reason why millions and
[2536.74 - 2540.88] millions of Americans are suffering from
[2538.54 - 2543.52] brain issues and it's another reason why
[2540.88 - 2546.70] you can't do a keto diet
[2543.52 - 2548.02] a real keto diet like they tried years
[2546.70 - 2550.18] ago
[2548.02 - 2551.26] you'll notice keto diets have sugar in
[2550.18 - 2553.96] them now
[2551.26 - 2556.54] huh I'm confused why is it called the
[2553.96 - 2557.80] keto diet then you can't go into ketosis
[2556.54 - 2561.22] if you're eating foods that have sugar
[2557.80 - 2563.98] in them and avocados part sugar
[2561.22 - 2566.50] you can't go into ketosis with an
[2563.98 - 2570.52] avocado but they brought avocados into
[2566.50 - 2572.86] the keto diet the pre-keto diet did not
[2570.52 - 2574.78] have avocado in it
[2572.86 - 2578.28] and people lost their glucose their
[2574.78 - 2578.28] glycogen storages in the brain
[2578.68 - 2583.60] keto diets now have berries in there
[2580.60 - 2586.06] berries have sugar in there they're
[2583.60 - 2587.74] sugar and berries why is that allowed in
[2586.06 - 2589.96] the keto diet now
[2587.74 - 2593.58] because the old keto diet actually
[2589.96 - 2593.58] killed a bunch of people
[2593.86 - 2597.94] I talked to one doctor that said whole
[2596.32 - 2599.50] bunch of his colleagues and he didn't he
[2597.94 - 2600.82] didn't buy it at all a whole bunch of
[2599.50 - 2603.10] his colleagues were doing the keto diet
[2600.82 - 2605.08] back in the 80s back in the 90s when
[2603.10 - 2606.28] they were doing just keto where was you
[2605.08 - 2608.20] aren't allowed sugars you weren't
[2606.28 - 2610.36] allowed carbs you weren't allowed honey
[2608.20 - 2611.74] you weren't allowed berries you weren't
[2610.36 - 2613.84] allowed any of that and they lost
[2611.74 - 2616.06] patience they died because when they
[2613.84 - 2617.86] followed that rule they starved to death
[2616.06 - 2619.78] in their brain atrophied
[2617.86 - 2622.66] the same way with the carnivore diet now
[2619.78 - 2624.52] huh why is the carnivore diet allowing
[2622.66 - 2627.76] honey in it now
[2624.52 - 2630.52] because a whole bunch of idiots that got
[2627.76 - 2631.72] tricked into the you know carnivore diet
[2630.52 - 2633.28] meaning where they're trying to sell
[2631.72 - 2634.84] carnivore programs they're trying to be
[2633.28 - 2636.88] like carnivore experts where they only
[2634.84 - 2639.28] do animal meat by itself and that's it
[2636.88 - 2642.16] they couldn't hack it because you need
[2639.28 - 2644.02] sugar for the brain they were going off
[2642.16 - 2645.70] their carnivore diets and binging and
[2644.02 - 2648.66] then going back on their carnivore diets
[2645.70 - 2648.66] does it sound familiar
[2648.94 - 2652.66] staying away from carbs and sugar and
[2650.68 - 2655.12] then binging and then having to go back
[2652.66 - 2657.34] on no carbs and sugar
[2655.12 - 2659.38] even though meat has a tiny bit of sugar
[2657.34 - 2662.08] in it in the blood of the meat it's
[2659.38 - 2663.94] still not enough to actually purpose
[2662.08 - 2665.14] how much someone needs to do or use
[2663.94 - 2667.06] their brain
[2665.14 - 2668.74] and so they were bumping into walls on
[2667.06 - 2670.60] the carnivore diet
[2668.74 - 2672.70] and so they were adding berries now
[2670.60 - 2674.74] there's berries in the carnivore diet
[2672.70 - 2677.14] there's berries in the keto diet there's
[2674.74 - 2681.16] sugar in all the Ketone carnivore diets
[2677.14 - 2684.22] how why because you couldn't survive you
[2681.16 - 2687.76] would die you would literally die your
[2684.22 - 2689.94] brain needs sugar it's critical
[2687.76 - 2689.94] foreign
[2691.08 - 2696.88] it's either the information from above
[2694.18 - 2698.56] or I'm a genius because they took that
[2696.88 - 2701.92] information from medical medium in the
[2698.56 - 2705.34] carnivore diet peeps now they do medical
[2701.92 - 2707.14] medium sugars berries and raw honey and
[2705.34 - 2708.64] whatever
[2707.14 - 2710.38] because they know their brain runs on
[2708.64 - 2712.12] sugar they know because the medical
[2710.38 - 2715.86] medium info because science doesn't talk
[2712.12 - 2715.86] about it out there about how that works
[2719.68 - 2723.82] Rita
[2721.48 - 2727.56] oh my god wow Anthony I'm relearning
[2723.82 - 2729.52] everything now I was listening to
[2727.56 - 2731.92] months ago
[2729.52 - 2734.26] and he was talking about straight keto
[2731.92 - 2737.58] and blueberry smoothies
[2734.26 - 2739.66] staying away from sugar well
[2737.58 - 2741.90] steals a lot of medical medium
[2739.66 - 2741.90] information
[2742.90 - 2750.04] and then humors his crowd with it
[2747.22 - 2751.54] as if he knew the information before but
[2750.04 - 2753.94] he doesn't
[2751.54 - 2756.58] and yes why are they doing blueberry
[2753.94 - 2759.28] smoothies now why are keto diets doing
[2756.58 - 2761.50] blueberry smoothies
[2759.28 - 2763.24] interesting
[2761.50 - 2764.98] why do people want to do a blueberry
[2763.24 - 2767.26] smoothie uh medical medium information
[2764.98 - 2768.04] the wild blueberry smoothies and notice
[2767.26 - 2769.84] people are talking about wild
[2768.04 - 2772.12] blueberries now out there
[2769.84 - 2774.10] as if we didn't already talk about it
[2772.12 - 2776.20] forever
[2774.10 - 2779.62] Donna s says I was on a carnivore diet
[2776.20 - 2781.96] keto diet for years and that's when I
[2779.62 - 2784.00] got so sick Donna or people who did the
[2781.96 - 2785.74] carnivore diet to the letter and died
[2784.00 - 2788.50] there are people who did the keto diet
[2785.74 - 2790.24] years ago to the letter and died
[2788.50 - 2792.04] the reason why is because they had no
[2790.24 - 2793.84] glucose to their brain anymore they
[2792.04 - 2798.72] followed it to the letter they didn't
[2793.84 - 2798.72] binge they stayed on it until they died
[2806.20 - 2810.40] people get some results at first when
[2808.54 - 2812.14] they cut out all the garbage in the
[2810.40 - 2814.00] processed foods and they do a mono diet
[2812.14 - 2815.56] of just meat by itself they feel like
[2814.00 - 2817.18] they have found the Panacea for five
[2815.56 - 2818.80] minutes and then it all goes downhill
[2817.18 - 2820.24] after that and they're on raw honey and
[2818.80 - 2822.10] then they're on berries and then they're
[2820.24 - 2824.32] redesigning their carnivore diet they're
[2822.10 - 2825.94] redesigning their keto diet what are
[2824.32 - 2828.10] they turning it into in the end they're
[2825.94 - 2831.10] turning it into the medical medium diets
[2828.10 - 2832.06] that's what's so crazy
[2831.10 - 2834.82] foreign
[2832.06 - 2839.04] but yet they make a lot of mistakes
[2834.82 - 2839.04] because they don't have all the details
[2844.06 - 2849.04] being starved of glucose for too long
[2846.34 - 2850.90] shrinks the brain it's one reason why
[2849.04 - 2853.30] millions and millions of Americans are
[2850.90 - 2856.30] suffering from brain issues
[2853.30 - 2859.30] as brains are degenerating and reducing
[2856.30 - 2862.90] in size those in the health movement
[2859.30 - 2867.22] should be saying whoa
[2862.90 - 2871.68] we need to get the diet truly right we
[2867.22 - 2871.68] need to get sugars back to the brain
[2874.06 - 2879.60] the brain's electricity does not run on
[2876.10 - 2879.60] fat it runs on sugar
[2880.96 - 2885.10] Cold Light spring and now people think
[2883.00 - 2886.78] your info was always out there it's
[2885.10 - 2888.94] insane
[2886.78 - 2890.32] yeah that's a that's actually a tactic
[2888.94 - 2892.72] and a strategy
[2890.32 - 2895.72] that's what they do like if I talk about
[2892.72 - 2898.06] all these incredible details about fat
[2895.72 - 2899.26] if they hear fat out there they'll just
[2898.06 - 2900.82] like oh wait that must have been out
[2899.26 - 2903.10] there because of the word fat like they
[2900.82 - 2905.14] don't even realize the concepts and the
[2903.10 - 2907.12] in the info and the details it's just
[2905.14 - 2909.46] that's a trick to get you not to listen
[2907.12 - 2911.74] to Medical medium information so they
[2909.46 - 2913.42] can steal it too there's people in the
[2911.74 - 2914.92] medical medium community that healed
[2913.42 - 2916.66] every illness in their medical meaning
[2914.92 - 2918.34] like with their medical medium
[2916.66 - 2920.44] information here right that they used
[2918.34 - 2922.72] right that was offered to them for free
[2920.44 - 2923.86] and they they used it and they healed
[2922.72 - 2926.02] everything
[2923.86 - 2928.54] and then
[2926.02 - 2930.46] but they want to steal it so then
[2928.54 - 2932.34] they'll say oh fruits and vegetables
[2930.46 - 2935.62] have always been around
[2932.34 - 2936.94] medical medium I I can just you know
[2935.62 - 2938.74] what forget it
[2936.94 - 2939.76] yeah I healed through medical media but
[2938.74 - 2941.26] now I'm going to go out there and say I
[2939.76 - 2942.40] didn't feel for medical medium I healed
[2941.26 - 2944.32] because I knew how to eat fruits and
[2942.40 - 2945.52] vegetables it's not that there are
[2944.32 - 2946.78] people who have been on fruits and
[2945.52 - 2949.74] vegetables but they have to find this
[2946.78 - 2949.74] information to heal
[2955.36 - 2958.20] it's interesting
[2963.58 - 2968.68] if you're listening to this live alone
[2965.14 - 2971.68] you know the info it's not out there
[2968.68 - 2974.02] there's so much intricate detail in this
[2971.68 - 2976.36] live right now in this moment
[2974.02 - 2979.12] it's a tremendous amount of details and
[2976.36 - 2981.94] it's intricate it's comprehensive just
[2979.12 - 2983.62] in this alone right here
[2981.94 - 2985.48] like all the books in the lives in the
[2983.62 - 2987.78] podcast right you guys know
[2985.48 - 2987.78] yeah
[2987.88 - 2992.08] the brains of electricity does not run
[2989.68 - 2993.88] on fat it runs on sugars too much fat
[2992.08 - 2996.76] actually gets in the way of the brain's
[2993.88 - 2999.30] electrical grid system fatty brains make
[2996.76 - 3001.98] electrical grid system go
[2999.30 - 3003.78] overheat and cause problems
[3001.98 - 3006.36] foreign
[3003.78 - 3008.46] this is why only a small percentage of
[3006.36 - 3011.82] fat naturally occurs in a healthy brain
[3008.46 - 3014.34] glucose helps reduce heat and keep brain
[3011.82 - 3016.62] tissue cool this is why someone would
[3014.34 - 3017.64] someone with toxic heavy metals in the
[3016.62 - 3019.68] brain
[3017.64 - 3020.94] causing a condition such as bipolar
[3019.68 - 3022.62] because you know in the books if you've
[3020.94 - 3024.06] read the brand saver books or heard
[3022.62 - 3027.54] medical meme information throughout the
[3024.06 - 3029.58] years you know that Metals create the
[3027.54 - 3031.62] bipolar diagnosis in the end when
[3029.58 - 3034.92] someone's up down up and
[3031.62 - 3037.22] and they get a diagnosis of that
[3034.92 - 3037.22] foreign
[3037.38 - 3041.22] this is why someone with toxic heavy
[3039.66 - 3044.46] metals in the brain causing a condition
[3041.22 - 3047.34] such as bipolar often has such a strong
[3044.46 - 3051.62] sugar craving people with
[3047.34 - 3056.16] that diagnosis of bipolar have a really
[3051.62 - 3057.90] craving craving craving to sugar
[3056.16 - 3059.88] with the increased heat from the toxic
[3057.90 - 3062.34] heavy metals the brain's own adaptive
[3059.88 - 3064.02] cooling nature is diminished plus excess
[3062.34 - 3065.82] fat in the long term can lead to
[3064.02 - 3067.92] unhealthy fatty tissue in the brain
[3065.82 - 3069.24] which increases brain heat what this is
[3067.92 - 3070.92] saying is more fat in your brain the
[3069.24 - 3073.80] more brain Heat
[3070.92 - 3076.26] when that happens the brain which again
[3073.80 - 3078.18] is formed from glycogen starts to
[3076.26 - 3080.10] shrivel up and break down as fat
[3078.18 - 3082.26] increases and builds up so more fat
[3080.10 - 3084.90] builds up in your brain your brain
[3082.26 - 3086.88] tissue starts to shrivel up more fat
[3084.90 - 3089.16] builds up in your brain your brain
[3086.88 - 3091.08] tissue starts to shrivel up you end up
[3089.16 - 3093.86] with more fat in your brain and less
[3091.08 - 3093.86] brain tissue
[3098.04 - 3103.74] taking what's the the brain taking
[3101.16 - 3105.66] what was the brain tissue space so your
[3103.74 - 3109.14] brain shrinking but the fats taking over
[3105.66 - 3112.50] the space this is powerful information
[3109.14 - 3113.82] its brain is atrophying
[3112.50 - 3116.70] but yet
[3113.82 - 3120.56] fat in and around the brain is taking up
[3116.70 - 3120.56] the space of where the brain was
[3126.12 - 3130.62] at the same time heavy metals oxidize
[3128.46 - 3133.50] and maladies such as Strokes Alzheimer's
[3130.62 - 3135.66] and Dementia can occur more easily fatty
[3133.50 - 3138.00] tissue buildup in the brain is not the
[3135.66 - 3140.52] same as someone being overweight just
[3138.00 - 3143.10] because someone is overweight
[3140.52 - 3145.08] doesn't mean they have a fatty brain and
[3143.10 - 3147.30] that's an that's interesting so that's
[3145.08 - 3149.40] clarification it's a detail that's
[3147.30 - 3153.92] important from above
[3149.40 - 3153.92] if they if they're eating healthily
[3154.26 - 3158.28] it doesn't mean that just because they
[3156.60 - 3159.24] have weight on them they have a fatty
[3158.28 - 3160.98] brain
[3159.24 - 3162.60] and just because someone isn't
[3160.98 - 3164.76] overweight doesn't mean their brain
[3162.60 - 3166.44] tissue is free from fatty deposits you
[3164.76 - 3167.64] could be thin and still have a fatty
[3166.44 - 3171.06] brain
[3167.64 - 3173.46] they could still have an unhealthy brain
[3171.06 - 3176.46] that contains large deposits of fat
[3173.46 - 3179.22] tissue whether someone is overweight or
[3176.46 - 3181.32] not with a low-fat diet and the
[3179.22 - 3182.76] healthiest foods there won't be this
[3181.32 - 3186.38] High increased
[3182.76 - 3186.38] fat tissue in the brain
[3187.44 - 3192.54] probably Wren says oh my God yes giving
[3190.02 - 3195.54] up fat helped me so much in overcoming
[3192.54 - 3198.90] my panic attacks and mood struggles
[3195.54 - 3202.80] right there on YouTube IG official card
[3198.90 - 3205.50] says I will be 51 tomorrow and look 30
[3202.80 - 3208.74] thanks to UAW congratulations on your
[3205.50 - 3211.34] birthday tomorrow amazing
[3208.74 - 3211.34] foreign
[3217.16 - 3222.24] going on a low carb diet for an extended
[3220.32 - 3226.08] time
[3222.24 - 3231.68] on YouTube Annabeth Lee maybe the people
[3226.08 - 3231.68] with light steel maybe the people
[3233.70 - 3236.82] with light steal it and then tell it to
[3235.92 - 3239.22] people
[3236.82 - 3242.16] who will be saved so then the spreading
[3239.22 - 3243.90] of these info is taking good turn
[3242.16 - 3246.30] doesn't it question mark So what you're
[3243.90 - 3249.30] saying Annabeth is maybe people with
[3246.30 - 3251.28] light in them steal it and then they
[3249.30 - 3253.68] tell it to other people who will be then
[3251.28 - 3255.96] saved so then the spreading of this
[3253.68 - 3259.08] information is taking a good turn
[3255.96 - 3262.32] doesn't it is that the question Annabeth
[3259.08 - 3265.02] no because here's what goes wrong they
[3262.32 - 3267.06] don't cite back the source so it becomes
[3265.02 - 3268.92] just a bit and a piece
[3267.06 - 3270.12] and then that one bit in the piece isn't
[3268.92 - 3271.74] enough because you're still going to do
[3270.12 - 3273.12] all these other things that are going to
[3271.74 - 3275.52] tip their scale
[3273.12 - 3276.90] they're still going to stay sick because
[3275.52 - 3278.94] they don't have enough of the
[3276.90 - 3281.10] information from the original Source
[3278.94 - 3284.72] it's not being cited back to the
[3281.10 - 3284.72] original source is what's happening
[3291.48 - 3294.96] it's really bad for people who are
[3293.28 - 3296.46] trying to heal and who are chronically
[3294.96 - 3298.26] ill it's like
[3296.46 - 3299.76] you're out there you're looking for an
[3298.26 - 3301.14] answer you're on your hands and knees
[3299.76 - 3303.66] you're praying to God even if you didn't
[3301.14 - 3305.22] even believe in God to begin with since
[3303.66 - 3306.72] a lot of people they turn to God when
[3305.22 - 3308.58] they're at The Darkest Hour when they
[3306.72 - 3310.86] weren't even God fearing or believing
[3308.58 - 3312.18] God anyway and they're just on their
[3310.86 - 3313.32] hands and knees they're praying to God
[3312.18 - 3315.72] and they're like I don't have any other
[3313.32 - 3318.54] options I'm using hope I lost this I
[3315.72 - 3320.82] lost my job my loved one left me I have
[3318.54 - 3323.40] all these problems I can't pay these
[3320.82 - 3325.26] doctor bills I'm so sick I've tried all
[3323.40 - 3326.76] the alternative medicine hacks I could
[3325.26 - 3328.32] possibly find I've been to functional
[3326.76 - 3329.70] medicine doctors I've been a herbalist
[3328.32 - 3331.68] I've been to Chinese medicine doctors
[3329.70 - 3333.42] I've been acupuncturist I've been to
[3331.68 - 3335.76] Do's I've been to naturopaths I've been
[3333.42 - 3338.82] to herbalists I've been to shamanic
[3335.76 - 3340.74] healers I've been everywhere I've tried
[3338.82 - 3343.20] Ayahuasca now that's my only like
[3340.74 - 3345.80] leftover thing I can possibly do is just
[3343.20 - 3348.54] just Blitz my brain out with Ayahuasca
[3345.80 - 3351.42] and I don't know where to go anymore
[3348.54 - 3353.46] because I have now 50 symptoms and
[3351.42 - 3355.32] building and people don't know really
[3353.46 - 3357.30] what's wrong with me I'm told I created
[3355.32 - 3359.16] it with my thoughts I'm hold my bodies
[3357.30 - 3361.02] attacking itself I'm told I'm a bad
[3359.16 - 3363.60] person and I just need to rewire my
[3361.02 - 3365.34] brain I've tried everything under the
[3363.60 - 3368.94] Sun including meditations and everything
[3365.34 - 3370.68] else and I am just sick and I don't know
[3368.94 - 3372.66] what to do and I'm at my darkest hour
[3370.68 - 3375.90] and I'm at my darkest point in my life
[3372.66 - 3377.76] and then if you find a tidbit that was
[3375.90 - 3380.04] shared somewhere for medical medium
[3377.76 - 3382.56] information but not cited back to all
[3380.04 - 3384.66] the incredible things you can do and the
[3382.56 - 3387.72] info to learn and know what it's about
[3384.66 - 3389.10] so you can heal and grow you just get a
[3387.72 - 3391.68] tidbit you're gonna like oh that's
[3389.10 - 3394.98] interesting I'll try that at the same
[3391.68 - 3397.56] time I'll try that wild blueberry I'll
[3394.98 - 3400.26] take my charcoal that this other person
[3397.56 - 3402.06] said to take or the same time I'm having
[3400.26 - 3402.96] my wild blueberry for medical medium
[3402.06 - 3405.00] that I don't know it's for medical
[3402.96 - 3407.46] meaning info because it was never cited
[3405.00 - 3408.90] back to you know him I'll take my wild
[3407.46 - 3411.54] blueberry thing
[3408.90 - 3414.00] eat my wild blueberries and I'll also
[3411.54 - 3416.82] take my Pearl powder my ionizer water
[3414.00 - 3419.70] which is poisoning the brain uh my
[3416.82 - 3421.32] charcoal my shilajit that cost like a
[3419.70 - 3422.64] hundred dollars for just a little speck
[3421.32 - 3424.56] of it which doesn't do anything for
[3422.64 - 3427.08] anybody and I'll just do all this stuff
[3424.56 - 3429.90] and it's just endless
[3427.08 - 3432.06] but what happens is that people steal
[3429.90 - 3434.40] the info to make them look like they
[3432.06 - 3435.84] know more that's why they do it too out
[3434.40 - 3437.22] there they don't want to cite it back to
[3435.84 - 3439.32] medical meaning because they want to
[3437.22 - 3441.78] steal it so they look like they know
[3439.32 - 3444.18] something because that's what happens
[3441.78 - 3445.56] the podcast doctors are stealing so much
[3444.18 - 3447.78] info from here because they don't have
[3445.56 - 3449.28] any info of their own so they're taking
[3447.78 - 3451.38] it and then it makes them look like
[3449.28 - 3453.12] they're really smart and so they can say
[3451.38 - 3457.40] these few talking points and then people
[3453.12 - 3460.62] go oh my God Epstein-Barr wait a minute
[3457.40 - 3461.88] uh Metals toxic heavy metals and it
[3460.62 - 3463.26] makes them look like they really know
[3461.88 - 3464.82] what they're talking about but they
[3463.26 - 3466.38] don't and then you just can't get
[3464.82 - 3468.36] anywhere then they talk bad about
[3466.38 - 3471.30] medical medium on their on the same time
[3468.36 - 3473.70] oh reliable source says medical meme
[3471.30 - 3475.62] information should not be trusted a
[3473.70 - 3477.84] reliable source says medical medium
[3475.62 - 3480.18] shouldn't be trusted that's a real a
[3477.84 - 3482.70] reliable source says this
[3480.18 - 3484.38] no we're gonna steal his info and use it
[3482.70 - 3487.38] but we're gonna step on him on at the
[3484.38 - 3490.68] same time and then the person if they're
[3487.38 - 3492.90] told it's medical medium to begin with
[3490.68 - 3494.94] right they may be like oh that person
[3492.90 - 3496.26] said reliable sources to stay away from
[3494.94 - 3499.14] medical medium so they can't get help
[3496.26 - 3500.76] that way anyway or if they use the mm
[3499.14 - 3502.86] info
[3500.76 - 3504.36] and they don't even cite back the source
[3502.86 - 3506.16] the person's gonna never know where to
[3504.36 - 3508.20] go to get help it's endless it's like
[3506.16 - 3510.54] whatever
[3508.20 - 3512.10] I mean that's one way to that's just one
[3510.54 - 3515.10] angle of it there's so many different
[3512.10 - 3517.62] aspects of how it's all done now
[3515.10 - 3520.32] why should I even care
[3517.62 - 3522.30] well Spirit of compassion told me when I
[3520.32 - 3524.46] was younger you have to care
[3522.30 - 3526.08] you have to care about the suffering and
[3524.46 - 3528.06] the people who are really really
[3526.08 - 3530.04] struggling you have to care about the
[3528.06 - 3532.68] people who can't find an answer
[3530.04 - 3534.30] I remember when I was a little boy and I
[3532.68 - 3535.74] said the spirit of compassion I don't
[3534.30 - 3538.26] care
[3535.74 - 3540.72] I just want to ride my bicycle
[3538.26 - 3542.28] I want to just grab a fishing rod and go
[3540.72 - 3544.26] to the pond
[3542.28 - 3546.06] and I don't want to know about what's
[3544.26 - 3547.08] inside somebody's body and I don't want
[3546.06 - 3550.08] to know
[3547.08 - 3552.48] why someone's suffering because I'm six
[3550.08 - 3555.06] years old and I can't be bothered with
[3552.48 - 3556.92] this right now and SOC said to me I'd
[3555.06 - 3559.26] better care and I better learn how to
[3556.92 - 3563.06] care fast
[3559.26 - 3563.06] and I never forgot that lesson
[3564.00 - 3569.16] because Spirit of compassion told me
[3565.68 - 3571.46] this you don't understand Anthony when
[3569.16 - 3571.46] someone
[3571.98 - 3576.60] their health goes down hell
[3574.68 - 3577.80] it's everything to them and I was
[3576.60 - 3579.72] listening as a little boy and I said
[3577.80 - 3581.76] what do you mean it's everything to them
[3579.72 - 3583.32] and spiritual passion said to me you
[3581.76 - 3585.12] don't get it you're not in their shoes
[3583.32 - 3587.16] so you're not going to understand it
[3585.12 - 3589.32] you're not going to understand what it's
[3587.16 - 3591.66] like when you've been to 12 doctors and
[3589.32 - 3594.36] 15 doctors
[3591.66 - 3596.82] and you're really sick and you're almost
[3594.36 - 3599.58] bedridden and no one has an answer
[3596.82 - 3601.32] and SOC said Anthony you don't
[3599.58 - 3603.90] understand what that is you have to
[3601.32 - 3608.34] learn what that is because that is
[3603.90 - 3610.10] everything so you have to care and so I
[3608.34 - 3612.90] spent my life
[3610.10 - 3614.94] connecting to that and so when people
[3612.90 - 3617.16] don't cite something back that could
[3614.94 - 3619.62] save their life to the original source
[3617.16 - 3621.96] of the info or they steal it to just
[3619.62 - 3625.38] make it look like they know better
[3621.96 - 3629.28] to get some followers or to sell
[3625.38 - 3632.66] programs it's sad
[3629.28 - 3632.66] it's just really sad
[3633.24 - 3638.46] instead if they gave the original credit
[3635.94 - 3641.88] to Medical medium information and stop
[3638.46 - 3644.22] talking crap to tear mm down and people
[3641.88 - 3646.62] would get what they need but the evil
[3644.22 - 3649.02] tactic of stealing info and then trying
[3646.62 - 3651.42] to talk bad about medical medium keeps a
[3649.02 - 3654.56] lot of people from healing and even
[3651.42 - 3654.56] trusting the information
[3655.04 - 3659.64] well well we need to have time for that
[3658.02 - 3663.36] one and I need energy shifter it's
[3659.64 - 3665.88] heartbreaking truly heartbreaking
[3663.36 - 3668.16] I have to say so you guys we covered
[3665.88 - 3670.68] some powerful information incredible
[3668.16 - 3673.56] information about the brain about how it
[3670.68 - 3676.86] works about breast milk too about a
[3673.56 - 3678.96] baby's brain developing all of it
[3676.86 - 3681.12] there's so much info in this book I
[3678.96 - 3681.92] can't even scratch the surface
[3681.12 - 3685.02] you guys
[3681.92 - 3686.94] [Music]
[3685.02 - 3689.94] Rita says Anthony you look great today
[3686.94 - 3692.94] honored
[3689.94 - 3692.94] robot
[3695.49 - 3698.57] [Music]
[3701.85 - 3707.78] [Music]
[3703.68 - 3707.78] you guys God bless you too
[3707.94 - 3713.36] incredible information honestly it goes
[3709.92 - 3713.36] on and on and on whoa
[3714.30 - 3718.16] my God this part here coming up
[3721.46 - 3728.34] [Music]
[3725.22 - 3732.20] this part coming up is insane
[3728.34 - 3732.20] it's about Trace mineral salts
[3732.96 - 3737.34] this is incredible information right
[3735.06 - 3740.16] here there's this one section here I'll
[3737.34 - 3742.14] read this one little section right here
[3740.16 - 3744.24] trace minerals are not just physical
[3742.14 - 3747.48] tangible minerals
[3744.24 - 3750.78] like in the food right trace minerals
[3747.48 - 3753.96] have connected to everything above us
[3750.78 - 3757.64] beyond the Earth our atmosphere is
[3753.96 - 3757.64] filled with trace minerals
[3758.46 - 3763.38] outer space is filled with trace
[3760.56 - 3766.26] minerals I'm on page 414 of brain saver
[3763.38 - 3769.20] this is wait to hear this
[3766.26 - 3771.30] this is incredible
[3769.20 - 3773.58] everybody thinks trace minerals is just
[3771.30 - 3774.78] something that's like in
[3773.58 - 3776.22] a food
[3774.78 - 3779.46] when they hear it when they learn about
[3776.22 - 3781.74] trace minerals being inside of food
[3779.46 - 3786.00] so there's macro minerals inside food
[3781.74 - 3787.74] there's trace minerals inside food okay
[3786.00 - 3790.20] so they think well that's trace minerals
[3787.74 - 3792.72] inside water there's macro minerals
[3790.20 - 3794.34] inside there's solids inside water right
[3792.72 - 3796.32] you have solids inside water you have
[3794.34 - 3798.66] macro minerals inside water you have
[3796.32 - 3802.14] trace minerals inside water it's part of
[3798.66 - 3804.12] the solid group inside water
[3802.14 - 3806.76] trace minerals are not just physical
[3804.12 - 3810.00] tangible minerals they have a Godly
[3806.76 - 3812.70] presence so a trace mineral isn't just a
[3810.00 - 3814.62] tangible like metal because that's what
[3812.70 - 3816.92] these are mineral Metals they're
[3814.62 - 3816.92] different
[3817.32 - 3821.82] trace minerals are not just physical
[3819.18 - 3824.10] tangible minerals they have a Godly
[3821.82 - 3826.26] presence
[3824.10 - 3828.12] trace minerals have connected to
[3826.26 - 3831.60] everything above us
[3828.12 - 3834.24] beyond the Earth our atmosphere fear is
[3831.60 - 3838.10] filled with trace minerals outer space
[3834.24 - 3838.10] is filled with trace minerals
[3838.38 - 3844.50] trace minerals can be dead or trace
[3841.20 - 3847.08] minerals can be alive and active
[3844.50 - 3849.90] the frequencies and signals that come
[3847.08 - 3852.42] down from the universe
[3849.90 - 3855.00] on the bridge that neurotransmitter
[3852.42 - 3857.10] chemicals are extending stimulate
[3855.00 - 3858.72] activate and ignite trace minerals
[3857.10 - 3862.20] inside our brain
[3858.72 - 3864.48] into life giving them in order and a
[3862.20 - 3866.52] direction to directly attach themselves
[3864.48 - 3868.26] to neurons and restore neurotransmitter
[3866.52 - 3869.64] chemicals so this is talking about how
[3868.26 - 3872.18] Trace Metals work that are in our
[3869.64 - 3872.18] atmosphere
[3872.22 - 3877.80] they're all around us it's incredible
[3876.18 - 3879.90] Rumble
[3877.80 - 3882.00] see
[3879.90 - 3885.66] Michael Drew
[3882.00 - 3888.78] medical medium was The Missing Link
[3885.66 - 3890.52] that I was searching for for years
[3888.78 - 3892.56] incredible
[3890.52 - 3895.32] hey guys let's make an energy shifter
[3892.56 - 3898.40] let's do it I'm bringing it to the
[3895.32 - 3898.40] energy shifter right now
[3898.50 - 3901.58] I'm in brain saver
[3902.58 - 3909.24] let's do it foreign
[3905.06 - 3911.78] I have the energy shifter earlier
[3909.24 - 3916.10] before coming on
[3911.78 - 3916.10] I think I'm going to do that more often
[3916.20 - 3919.34] is what I think I'm going to do
[3920.46 - 3926.64] Carson says this is why healing is such
[3924.30 - 3928.68] a spiritual experience once you start
[3926.64 - 3931.32] getting enough trace minerals you truly
[3928.68 - 3934.86] feel connected to something higher truly
[3931.32 - 3937.86] one and Powerful amazing reason
[3934.86 - 3940.44] so energy shifter use the shot when
[3937.86 - 3942.12] energetic strength is required for
[3940.44 - 3945.32] example
[3942.12 - 3945.32] you can try this shot
[3945.96 - 3952.88] at the midpoint of a long day when
[3948.78 - 3952.88] you're desperate for an energy boost
[3953.58 - 3958.32] you can try this shot Jasmine says on
[3956.16 - 3961.32] YouTube this shot really works
[3958.32 - 3965.54] I've done it a few times and it gives me
[3961.32 - 3965.54] Steady energy during the day
[3965.76 - 3971.16] incredible
[3967.32 - 3974.16] use a shot when you feel unbalanced as
[3971.16 - 3975.90] if you don't have enough energy

[4238.34 - 4242.48] sweet potato right here so I'm gonna get
[4240.02 - 4244.96] a half a cup of sweet potato
[4242.48 - 4244.96] going
[4245.24 - 4248.62] it's amazing
[4252.38 - 4257.36] excited so I got my carrots ready I got
[4254.48 - 4260.12] my sweet potatoes ready we're doing good
[4257.36 - 4262.60] half half a cup of chopped red bell
[4260.12 - 4262.60] pepper
[4263.54 - 4265.72] foreign
[4268.16 - 4271.54] just a bad habit
[4271.70 - 4276.32] I toss my food in the air a lot of times
[4273.92 - 4279.02] in the kitchen and
[4276.32 - 4280.64] let me take out the center piece here
[4279.02 - 4283.66] there we go
[4280.64 - 4288.34] all right half cup of
[4283.66 - 4288.34] chopped bell pepper we got it
[4292.82 - 4296.30] it's like almost the medical medium
[4294.68 - 4298.16] cooking show that's what this is
[4296.30 - 4300.20] reminding me about a little bit
[4298.16 - 4303.10] okay and then the other one is pineapple
[4300.20 - 4303.10] so let's get this rolling
[4309.20 - 4312.16] that's right
[4315.08 - 4318.46] almost tricked myself
[4320.12 - 4326.42] it's got some carrot in there first
[4323.42 - 4326.42] foreign
[4327.22 - 4333.44] carrot juice the reason why
[4330.74 - 4336.50] is because people like would do just
[4333.44 - 4338.54] carrot juice right they'd buy carrot
[4336.50 - 4340.10] juice gallons of carrot juice it's rid
[4338.54 - 4341.72] of compassion said it was never a great
[4340.10 - 4343.04] idea this is different it's a small
[4341.72 - 4344.78] amount of carrot juice mixed in with
[4343.04 - 4347.06] everything else
[4344.78 - 4348.26] make sure whatever you're using that's
[4347.06 - 4351.46] frozen
[4348.26 - 4351.46] is thawed out
[4351.62 - 4356.66] make sure it's thaw because if it's not
[4354.74 - 4358.34] thawed and it's still frozen it's not
[4356.66 - 4360.80] going to create any juice you're just
[4358.34 - 4361.64] gonna have ice cream
[4360.80 - 4363.44] foreign
[4361.64 - 4365.24] so make sure you do that that's
[4363.44 - 4366.92] important to know keep that in mind all
[4365.24 - 4368.24] right all right so there's some carrots
[4366.92 - 4370.10] in there
[4368.24 - 4372.14] now we're gonna head to raw sweet
[4370.10 - 4375.10] potatoes
[4372.14 - 4375.10] nice
[4379.16 - 4383.68] I'm really happy you guys like this
[4381.44 - 4383.68] drink
[4384.14 - 4387.16] I'm very happy
[4388.58 - 4392.54] the one thing about the one thing you
[4390.56 - 4394.40] have to realize is this is a synergistic
[4392.54 - 4397.40] combination
[4394.40 - 4400.52] of wild Foods herbs
[4397.40 - 4402.86] fruits vegetables leafy greens right
[4400.52 - 4404.60] done done in a way that no one would
[4402.86 - 4406.70] know it's from above the reason why
[4404.60 - 4409.70] these have an instant hit
[4406.70 - 4411.26] and Sensations and results that happen
[4409.70 - 4413.90] for people
[4411.26 - 4415.82] the reason for it is because it's
[4413.90 - 4417.56] information from above signs of research
[4415.82 - 4419.48] does not know alternative medicine does
[4417.56 - 4422.54] not know that it's exactly the
[4419.48 - 4425.66] phytochemical compounds that come from
[4422.54 - 4427.22] this specific group in the amounts that
[4425.66 - 4429.02] makes a difference in somebody's life
[4427.22 - 4433.46] and that's what's incredible about the
[4429.02 - 4436.70] mm info right it's not beholding to
[4433.46 - 4438.86] bad ideas that are out there it's not to
[4436.70 - 4441.50] hold into that it's free from that it's
[4438.86 - 4443.24] from above so it's free from all of that
[4441.50 - 4446.38] which is really incredible okay let's
[4443.24 - 4446.38] get some pineapple in here
[4448.22 - 4452.66] nice
[4450.02 - 4454.64] now I'm using Frozen pineapple I'm just
[4452.66 - 4457.64] letting you know
[4454.64 - 4459.80] I defrosted it so it's defrosted so keep
[4457.64 - 4464.80] that in mind
[4459.80 - 4464.80] okay put a little bit more in here
[4465.86 - 4468.70] nice
[4472.22 - 4476.98] amazing
[4473.84 - 4476.98] now what I do is
[4477.92 - 4480.86] give it a little time to get through
[4479.54 - 4483.68] because what you're doing is you're
[4480.86 - 4487.84] saving money with this juicer
[4483.68 - 4487.84] because the pulp comes out so dry
[4490.52 - 4495.02] now what I notice when people juice
[4492.20 - 4497.60] carrots with other juicers it's sloppy
[4495.02 - 4498.80] wet and you need bags and bags of
[4497.60 - 4500.66] carrots
[4498.80 - 4502.64] and you don't need that with this it's
[4500.66 - 4504.44] incredible
[4502.64 - 4508.34] it's why I endorse this machine this is
[4504.44 - 4509.90] the mm-1500 the mm900 1500 are amazing
[4508.34 - 4511.46] this is the one with the full
[4509.90 - 4513.14] Nutritional Center and everything it's a
[4511.46 - 4516.28] mega check it out link is in the
[4513.14 - 4516.28] description link is in the profile
[4521.30 - 4526.28] so to get this much juice comparatively
[4524.60 - 4527.78] what I noticed with all the other
[4526.28 - 4531.26] juicers that I've been through this just
[4527.78 - 4533.36] to get this much I would have to use
[4531.26 - 4536.48] loads of produce that's not an
[4533.36 - 4539.00] exaggeration I would have to put a lot
[4536.48 - 4540.92] of carrots in a lot of sweet potato a
[4539.00 - 4543.38] lot of bell pepper to get even that much
[4540.92 - 4545.74] juice and that's where people are saving
[4543.38 - 4549.74] money and that's critical
[4545.74 - 4550.94] food costs are going up every day
[4549.74 - 4551.90] you're going up every day I'm going to
[4550.94 - 4554.06] save this because I'm going to make
[4551.90 - 4556.22] another energy shifter later I love
[4554.06 - 4558.20] knowing that I'm saving produce I could
[4556.22 - 4560.96] do more energy shifters for less money
[4558.20 - 4563.30] you know when you're buying produce
[4560.96 - 4565.88] so it's incredible
[4563.30 - 4567.26] it's less wasteful everybody's you know
[4565.88 - 4569.72] always worried about waste and stuff
[4567.26 - 4572.68] well it's less wasteful how amazing and
[4569.72 - 4572.68] what you'll notice is
[4573.02 - 4578.18] that's dry pulp it's so much drier than
[4576.32 - 4580.58] the other machines so you're not
[4578.18 - 4582.98] throwing your produce out the window and
[4580.58 - 4585.44] that's what's incredible about it
[4582.98 - 4587.96] and people say well juicing you know
[4585.44 - 4589.64] you're wasting this you poop this out
[4587.96 - 4591.32] you would poop this out if you ate a
[4589.64 - 4592.40] carrot it would just go out in the
[4591.32 - 4595.04] toilet
[4592.40 - 4596.42] so people don't realize that you know
[4595.04 - 4597.38] and I talked about that many times you
[4596.42 - 4599.54] guys know
[4597.38 - 4601.16] but I'm not going to bring the poops out
[4599.54 - 4603.74] today because that's what I've always
[4601.16 - 4605.48] done when we talked about this is I
[4603.74 - 4608.30] bring the poops out I'm not going to
[4605.48 - 4611.00] bring the poops out although every part
[4608.30 - 4613.82] of me wants to run to the other room
[4611.00 - 4615.62] where I have a lot of props and go grab
[4613.82 - 4616.88] the plate of poop but I'm not gonna do
[4615.62 - 4619.34] it
[4616.88 - 4622.34] wait a minute who said that poop was a
[4619.34 - 4624.92] prop that was real poop from my friends
[4622.34 - 4627.89] that we dehydrated and I'm using as a
[4624.92 - 4632.98] prop all right
[4627.89 - 4632.98] [Music]
[4635.90 - 4638.92] can't help it
[4639.56 - 4645.23] anytime poop comes into question
[4641.82 - 4645.23] [Music]
[4645.32 - 4650.02] Dr Nesbitt also likes talking about poop
[4652.28 - 4656.90] man
[4654.02 - 4660.02] [Music]
[4656.90 - 4663.58] this is one of my favorite shots of all
[4660.02 - 4663.58] time the energy shifter
[4664.40 - 4667.84] I'm not gonna lie
[4667.94 - 4672.28] I drink a lot of the energy sifters
[4673.52 - 4677.78] because what I do is something that I
[4675.98 - 4679.34] don't think other people should do is
[4677.78 - 4681.02] they push themselves past their
[4679.34 - 4683.84] limitations
[4681.02 - 4686.79] and then I use medical medium tools
[4683.84 - 4690.50] to enable me to push me past limitations
[4686.79 - 4692.60] [Music]
[4690.50 - 4694.82] God I love that
[4692.60 - 4695.73] love it

[4756.74 - 4760.70] lot of silly stuff so I don't know

[5048.76 - 5052.36] have to realize that
[5051.10 - 5055.60] um
[5052.36 - 5059.40] Dr Nesbitt says
[5055.60 - 5059.40] ask your doctor what's right for you
[5059.50 - 5063.76] he says ask your doctor what's right for
[5061.36 - 5065.38] you should Dr Nesbit say he doesn't
[5063.76 - 5067.56] believe in any of this hogwash he called
[5065.38 - 5067.56] it
[5068.68 - 5072.34] he says he just likes hanging out with
[5070.66 - 5074.86] me
[5072.34 - 5078.40] that's all
[5074.86 - 5081.22] although Dr Nesbitt did have
[5078.40 - 5082.90] a trauma shock and loss stabilizer
[5081.22 - 5085.42] recently and he says it helped him
[5082.90 - 5086.62] greatly rise with Melton oh my God had

[5092.26 - 5098.34] energy off the chain like the
[5095.32 - 5098.34] battery bunny
[5098.56 - 5104.26] Dr Nesbitt says how dare you talk about
[5102.16 - 5108.10] the Energizer Bunny which is a personal
[5104.26 - 5111.82] friend of Dr nesbit's Dr Nesbitt did a
[5108.10 - 5114.16] surgery on the Energizer Bunny
[5111.82 - 5116.44] if the Bashir says the energy shot is
[5114.16 - 5118.24] one of my favorite tasting drinks
[5116.44 - 5120.34] Dr Nesbitt
[5118.24 - 5123.04] Dr nesbeth said don't make fun of bunny
[5120.34 - 5124.72] rabbits the Energizer Bunny I know
[5123.04 - 5126.40] you're not making fun of bunny rabbits
[5124.72 - 5128.62] just Dr Nesbitt he doesn't know what
[5126.40 - 5132.48] he's thinking right now because he's Dr
[5128.62 - 5132.48] Nesbitt had a few too many vodkas
[5133.72 - 5138.96] Tiffany shacklett says I quit coffee
[5136.12 - 5138.96] after your podcast

[5160.66 - 5164.32] Pilots
[5162.28 - 5166.42] Dr Nesbitt
[5164.32 - 5169.12] when you're on a plane you want your
[5166.42 - 5172.12] pilot to drink coffee
[5169.12 - 5173.98] um yeah but if your pilot needs to drink
[5172.12 - 5176.56] coffee then your pilot's not feeling
[5173.98 - 5179.02] well to begin with and doesn't have any
[5176.56 - 5181.72] energy or Clarity and he needs coffee to
[5179.02 - 5184.68] make he or she clear and that's kind of
