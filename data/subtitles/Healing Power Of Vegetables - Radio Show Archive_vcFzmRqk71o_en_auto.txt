[131.20 - 135.96] we're talking about the healing power of
[134.04 - 137.84] vegetables the healing power of
[135.96 - 139.32] vegetables we always hear about
[137.84 - 141.00] vegetables we always hear about eating
[139.32 - 142.72] our vegetables we always hear about how
[141.00 - 145.32] important they are we always think about
[142.72 - 147.32] them consciously whether or not we eat
[145.32 - 149.08] enough of them or not so today we're
[147.32 - 152.36] covering the in the ins and outs about
[149.08 - 154.40] them the power of them you name it I'm
[152.36 - 157.64] pulling some of the information straight
[154.40 - 159.72] out of my lifechanging Foods book um the
[157.64 - 162.88] one I'm so excited for you guys to to
[159.72 - 164.88] get in your hands uh soon and open up
[162.88 - 168.32] and just you'll you'll be in shock it's
[164.88 - 170.08] really cool Spirit gave me tremendous
[168.32 - 173.40] amounts of
[170.08 - 176.12] information that I put in this massive
[173.40 - 178.08] catalog this massive cat so this is this
[176.12 - 179.96] is going to be really exciting so and
[178.08 - 182.08] I'm pulling some of that out for today
[179.96 - 183.40] today because I want to talk about the
[182.08 - 186.20] power of these vegetables and what they
[183.40 - 188.60] have to offer um think about the LA
[186.20 - 190.68] event if you're going or not um tickets
[188.60 - 193.20] are selling so think about it we're
[190.68 - 195.44] doing the light blast ever since I was a
[193.20 - 197.72] child Spirit offered that opportunity
[195.44 - 199.76] for me to give to people because I saw
[197.72 - 201.76] so much suffering all the time non-stop
[199.76 - 204.68] no matter where I went no matter what I
[201.76 - 206.76] did and um the gift that I received at
[204.68 - 210.56] age 4 to diagnose my grandmother came
[206.76 - 212.04] with uh a lot of hardship and I know
[210.56 - 215.24] some of you guys know that about me if
[212.04 - 216.92] you just logged on and this is brand new
[215.24 - 218.52] the medical Medium show is brand new to
[216.92 - 219.76] you and this is your first show this
[218.52 - 221.64] this will kind of fill you in a little
[219.76 - 224.60] bit about it I diagnosed my grandmother
[221.64 - 227.28] at age 4 uh by hearing a voice perfectly
[224.60 - 229.24] clear as if someone was talking to me in
[227.28 - 232.08] my ear so it's on the
[229.24 - 234.16] outside of the body I'm not channeling
[232.08 - 236.20] and it's not intuition although I have
[234.16 - 238.36] tremendous respect for intuitives
[236.20 - 241.04] because they have to work so darn hard
[238.36 - 242.44] on mastering their intuition I know that
[241.04 - 244.08] that the audience that that's listening
[242.44 - 245.52] to right now all you guys are intuitive
[244.08 - 247.24] too and everything else but it wasn't
[245.52 - 249.44] intuition it was actually hearing a
[247.24 - 250.72] voice perfectly clear in real time just
[249.44 - 254.40] like you're hearing me right now with
[250.72 - 257.04] your own ear and it came with a lot of
[254.40 - 259.60] pain a lot of suffering in its own right
[257.04 - 261.60] and um and a lot of Agony and I was able
[259.60 - 264.04] to get through my teenage years without
[261.60 - 267.44] basically ending my life because of the
[264.04 - 269.16] severity of how difficult it was to live
[267.44 - 271.16] in the world today and hearing a voice
[269.16 - 274.48] 24 seven telling me what's going on with
[271.16 - 276.36] every aspect of someone's health and um
[274.48 - 278.40] and so but with that I saw a lot of
[276.36 - 280.68] suffering non-stop like I always have
[278.40 - 282.08] and um and and I do you know the
[280.68 - 283.88] readings come through no matter what at
[282.08 - 285.68] all times it makes me go partially blind
[283.88 - 287.44] I know that many of you who have read
[285.68 - 289.16] the book you've you've you've heard seen
[287.44 - 292.80] that it's like a snow blindness I call
[289.16 - 294.44] it and um and so what happened though is
[292.80 - 296.40] I asked Spirit at the young age I said
[294.44 - 298.04] what else can I do for people first of
[296.40 - 300.16] all there weren't a lot of resources
[298.04 - 302.52] back then I'm not trying to date myself
[300.16 - 304.96] and and and everything but but if we go
[302.52 - 308.00] all the way back down to that that place
[304.96 - 309.48] in time uh you couldn't get anything I
[308.00 - 311.08] mean you basically there are a few
[309.48 - 312.68] fruits and vegetables at best in the
[311.08 - 314.84] grocery store depending on where you
[312.68 - 317.28] lived in the country not everybody lived
[314.84 - 319.40] in California in the in in in Los
[317.28 - 321.56] Angeles where there was the first health
[319.40 - 323.52] food store in the United States you know
[321.56 - 327.84] we you know not everybody had that
[323.52 - 330.16] opportunity okay so you know and and
[327.84 - 331.88] because of that resources were low there
[330.16 - 335.92] weren't a lot of uh supplements that
[331.88 - 338.04] were discovered or or uh or or what is
[335.92 - 341.76] it created by Geniuses that we have
[338.04 - 343.56] today in alternative medicine and um and
[341.76 - 345.08] there there wasn't a lot of that going
[343.56 - 347.28] in fact there was virtually none of that
[345.08 - 349.68] going on and so I would ask Spirit what
[347.28 - 351.12] else can I do to ignite the healing
[349.68 - 353.76] process and spirit said we're going to
[351.12 - 356.48] do the light blast on each person if you
[353.76 - 358.20] want and at that time you know I asked
[356.48 - 360.52] for that help and spirit sent the light
[358.20 - 362.08] down on the person that I would ask for
[360.52 - 364.00] the light to hit and run right through
[362.08 - 366.12] the body unlock
[364.00 - 368.32] blockages completely change their
[366.12 - 370.44] chemistry on all levels and give them
[368.32 - 372.76] that ignition we do that at the events
[370.44 - 375.16] it drains the heck out of me but that's
[372.76 - 376.68] okay doesn't matter if my my um my
[375.16 - 378.32] assistants have to actually scrape me
[376.68 - 379.96] off the floor after we're done it
[378.32 - 382.56] doesn't matter because guess what it's
[379.96 - 385.24] so miraculous and what has happened from
[382.56 - 388.44] these light blasts has just been so
[385.24 - 391.64] great um just in the last event alone
[388.44 - 393.12] over 600 people reported experiencing a
[391.64 - 396.28] benefit to their health in one way or
[393.12 - 397.64] another so um anyway the bottom line is
[396.28 - 399.32] that's how it all happened that's what's
[397.64 - 401.48] happening go you know you can get to an
[399.32 - 403.76] LA the LA event November 5th if you want
[401.48 - 405.16] go to Medical medium.com check it out
[403.76 - 409.28] I'd love to see you there before the
[405.16 - 411.04] tickets get sold out um and you know see
[409.28 - 414.40] it it's basically like this when it
[411.04 - 417.48] comes down to Healing there's different
[414.40 - 419.92] levels of of healing in the sense where
[417.48 - 422.76] we need different things so we need
[419.92 - 425.00] different things and the life-changing
[422.76 - 427.48] Foods book you know I made it clear in
[425.00 - 430.20] that book about what we're looking at as
[427.48 - 433.48] far as what is hindering us all you know
[430.20 - 436.36] I'm releasing the truth about what's in
[433.48 - 439.36] our way because no one wants to hear it
[436.36 - 440.92] not you guys you guys want to hear it
[439.36 - 442.00] you guys want to know the truth you guys
[440.92 - 443.84] want to know how to protect your
[442.00 - 445.28] children you guys want to know how to
[443.84 - 448.20] protect your family you want to know how
[445.28 - 450.08] to protect you know yourself and your
[448.20 - 451.28] loved ones and your friends you know but
[450.08 - 453.60] there's a lot of people out there that
[451.28 - 456.84] just they don't want to know they don't
[453.60 - 459.52] want to know like what's really holding
[456.84 - 461.64] them back because it could be a little
[459.52 - 463.44] scary in the life-changing Foods I talk
[461.64 - 465.68] about the unforgiving for the
[463.44 - 468.76] unforgiving for are these things out
[465.68 - 471.36] there that you need to be aware of and
[468.76 - 473.08] look out for so you can protect yourself
[471.36 - 474.64] because you want that insurance you want
[473.08 - 478.80] that knowing that knowing that
[474.64 - 480.08] information and that knowing and and so
[478.80 - 482.40] that's that's what that's about so
[480.08 - 484.72] there's a lot of things that's one thing
[482.40 - 488.36] that we need that's one part of the
[484.72 - 490.80] puzzle that we need to heal and then
[488.36 - 494.76] there's other parts like what I call the
[490.80 - 497.52] holy four holy four are the food groups
[494.76 - 499.40] the food groups like The you know um the
[497.52 - 502.76] vegetabl the fruits the vegetables herbs
[499.40 - 505.32] and spices and wild foods and today
[502.76 - 508.32] we're covering uh a part of that Holy
[505.32 - 510.28] four we're covering uh the vegetables
[508.32 - 512.60] part and you know and how I laid it out
[510.28 - 513.88] in the book is if you if you look at
[512.60 - 515.72] what's happening and look what the
[513.88 - 518.52] vegetables can do and you line up your
[515.72 - 520.72] illnesses there's there over 700
[518.52 - 524.20] illnesses I have and conditions I have
[520.72 - 526.68] in in this book and I and I link these
[524.20 - 527.88] to what can help you get over these
[526.68 - 531.52] things through these fruits and
[527.88 - 535.16] vegetables it was a daunting
[531.52 - 538.48] grueling task with Spirit but it had to
[535.16 - 540.80] get done and so so we're going over
[538.48 - 542.16] vegetables today today now you know the
[540.80 - 543.80] when it comes down to vegetables and
[542.16 - 546.68] stuff so you've heard it since you were
[543.80 - 548.36] young right eat your vegetables and hey
[546.68 - 550.56] not everybody heard that when they were
[548.36 - 552.20] young and you know it's not anybody's
[550.56 - 555.48] fault there's some mommy and daddies
[552.20 - 557.20] that they get so busy and they have so
[555.48 - 559.84] much on their plate and so much dress
[557.20 - 561.80] that they can barely just get a happy
[559.84 - 563.88] meal for McDonald's and their children
[561.80 - 567.12] and some chicken fingers out of the
[563.88 - 569.28] freezer to survive and I have complete
[567.12 - 571.28] and total respect for that you have to
[569.28 - 574.00] understand that like um you know that's
[571.28 - 575.72] a that's a that's a big deal just you
[574.00 - 577.20] know making sure there's food on on the
[575.72 - 581.00] table for your family as it is and
[577.20 - 583.40] everything around it and children have
[581.00 - 586.40] minds of their owns my minds of their
[583.40 - 588.32] own okay they're the little people so
[586.40 - 591.20] they have their own palet they have
[588.32 - 594.16] their own tastes they have their own
[591.20 - 597.64] likings and you know and a lot of times
[594.16 - 599.48] um children don't like vegetables and
[597.64 - 602.60] don't want to eat a vegetable and a lot
[599.48 - 606.52] of times parents are so busy that you
[602.60 - 608.08] know working working with coaching um
[606.52 - 609.72] our children's really difficult
[608.08 - 611.00] sometimes when we're trying to survive
[609.72 - 612.84] we're trying to work we're trying to
[611.00 - 615.28] make sure there's everything else in
[612.84 - 617.32] place so we can protect our children so
[615.28 - 619.28] we kind of you know the the food thing
[617.32 - 621.28] gets put on the back burner a lot with
[619.28 - 624.08] families and as long as there's food on
[621.28 - 626.28] the table though that's all that matters
[624.08 - 628.28] you know when I was growing up and that
[626.28 - 630.60] was the the only thing that counted was
[628.28 - 633.08] was there something to eat you know for
[630.60 - 635.76] us kids was there something to eat on
[633.08 - 638.16] that table regardless of what it was it
[635.76 - 640.80] just we had to be eating something and
[638.16 - 642.52] you know and and it makes a lot of sense
[640.80 - 644.36] but you know but there's a lot of people
[642.52 - 646.88] that talked to that I've talked to and
[644.36 - 649.28] they're like yeah when I was younger I
[646.88 - 651.36] was always told to eat my vegetables I
[649.28 - 653.80] was always told you know you got to eat
[651.36 - 656.20] them you know you're not and then i'
[653.80 - 658.16] I've had people tell me you can't leave
[656.20 - 660.12] the table until you eat your vegetables
[658.16 - 661.48] you know when they were a child child
[660.12 - 663.16] and their parents would say you know
[661.48 - 665.12] you're not leaving the table there'd be
[663.16 - 666.84] punishment you know you wouldn't be able
[665.12 - 668.84] to leave the table you'd have to be sent
[666.84 - 671.00] to your room like all kinds of things
[668.84 - 672.96] I've heard from people because you know
[671.00 - 676.36] vegetables are
[672.96 - 678.28] important and so um you know our parents
[676.36 - 680.68] have tried to get some of some
[678.28 - 683.44] vegetables innocent in many of us in our
[680.68 - 685.48] lives and and like I said before others
[683.44 - 689.04] other other times it's just survival and
[685.48 - 692.72] whatever we can get to eat but so but
[689.04 - 695.92] vegetables have always been a role in
[692.72 - 699.56] humanity and the future of humankind in
[695.92 - 703.44] our survival in what we need to survive
[699.56 - 707.00] here because they hold keys they hold
[703.44 - 710.88] keys to the door the door of Health the
[707.00 - 713.24] door of well-being the door of
[710.88 - 715.44] lifegiving the door of
[713.24 - 717.28] fertility and um by the way there's a
[715.44 - 719.96] fertility chapter in life-changing Foods
[717.28 - 721.52] that's going to knock your socks off
[719.96 - 724.80] um
[721.52 - 727.60] and information about fertility and
[724.80 - 729.40] infertility you can't find anywhere and
[727.60 - 731.40] I'm not just trying to say that in a
[729.40 - 733.68] boasting way I'm just meaning it knocked
[731.40 - 738.00] my socks off when I got the information
[733.68 - 740.48] from Spirit I was blown away um but you
[738.00 - 744.52] know all this vegetables play a role in
[740.48 - 749.36] all of this you guys folks it plays a
[744.52 - 752.20] big role in opening up the door to to
[749.36 - 755.52] lifegiving to our future to where we're
[752.20 - 757.96] going to what we're doing everything our
[755.52 - 760.20] Consciousness everything about it it's
[757.96 - 764.04] involved with a vegetable it's a big
[760.20 - 768.04] piece of that and so it's one of these
[764.04 - 770.60] holy four I call them holy four it's one
[768.04 - 773.24] of these that's crucial and critical to
[770.60 - 774.96] our well-being to our life to where
[773.24 - 777.64] we're going to what we're doing just
[774.96 - 781.36] like I said before and it it matter
[777.64 - 783.72] matters that much to get them into us
[781.36 - 786.08] and what's really important in the
[783.72 - 787.28] vegetable department is leafy greens
[786.08 - 790.32] which I'm going to cover a little bit
[787.28 - 793.44] about what leafy greens do but leafy
[790.32 - 794.96] greens are they're practically almost a
[793.44 - 796.72] category of the Holy four on their own
[794.96 - 800.80] even though they're in the vegetables
[796.72 - 804.24] but they hold a lot of power and we tend
[800.80 - 806.40] to forget about leafy greens a lot even
[804.24 - 808.24] if we're um eating a really healthy
[806.40 - 811.00] paleo diet we tend to forget about
[808.24 - 813.52] eating a lot lot of leafy greens if
[811.00 - 814.88] we're eating um you know a vegetarian
[813.52 - 816.16] diet we forget about eating a lot of
[814.88 - 818.08] leafy greens if we're eating a
[816.16 - 819.80] plant-based or vegan diet which is
[818.08 - 821.80] pretty much the same if we're if we're
[819.80 - 826.32] you know we we forget about eating a lot
[821.80 - 829.84] of leafy greens it's easy to forget or
[826.32 - 832.48] to not get enough leafy greens in our
[829.84 - 835.80] system no matter what diet you subscribe
[832.48 - 837.88] to and you know I I don't care what diet
[835.80 - 839.24] it is really I mean in a sense that
[837.88 - 842.16] you're that you're into too if you're
[839.24 - 843.96] really into a paleo diet um which is
[842.16 - 846.28] basically now almost a vegan diet with
[843.96 - 848.40] just a little bit of lean meat because
[846.28 - 850.24] you know that's T we're learning to get
[848.40 - 851.84] people better it's more vegetables
[850.24 - 853.68] that's where we're going everybody's
[851.84 - 855.60] going that direction it's more
[853.68 - 858.36] vegetables and more fruit to get people
[855.60 - 859.80] better by the way so but whatever it is
[858.36 - 861.28] if you're on a you know paleo diet if
[859.80 - 863.56] you're on a ketogenic diet if you're on
[861.28 - 865.80] an Ain diet if you're on some branding
[863.56 - 867.72] diet like that if you're on you know a
[865.80 - 872.24] diet that has a branding name whatever
[867.72 - 873.84] it is you know um you have to bring in
[872.24 - 875.80] more leafy greens if you're on a
[873.84 - 879.28] Mediterranean diet you're just eating
[875.80 - 881.20] all this fish and if you're on a wild
[879.28 - 883.60] game diet you're just eating all this
[881.20 - 885.40] Wild game um someone was talking to me
[883.60 - 888.08] the other day and said you know I I I
[885.40 - 891.48] hunt my own game you know I I I hunt and
[888.08 - 895.68] kill my own rabbits I um you know hunt
[891.48 - 897.32] deer and stuff and and you know and uh
[895.68 - 898.72] first of all yeah it's the healthiest
[897.32 - 900.40] food you could possibly eat in theend
[898.72 - 902.20] Animal Kingdom as far as in the animal
[900.40 - 904.16] world if you're if you're into meat or
[902.20 - 907.60] you're into you know you're into the
[904.16 - 909.60] paleo diet then Wild game is by far you
[907.60 - 912.28] know the healthiest for you but I said
[909.60 - 915.72] to the person are you eating enough
[912.28 - 918.12] greens and maybe even Wild Greens and
[915.72 - 919.84] maybe even greens that are cousins to
[918.12 - 921.64] Wild Greens that you could buy in the
[919.84 - 922.80] store and they were like well no I
[921.64 - 924.28] wasn't thinking about that I was
[922.80 - 925.76] thinking about just protein protein
[924.28 - 928.96] protein and I was thinking about just
[925.76 - 931.68] getting the leanest leanest good fresh
[928.96 - 933.80] you know leanest freshest meat I can get
[931.68 - 935.36] and so I was just you know doing the
[933.80 - 938.32] hunting the game thing and everything I
[935.36 - 940.48] said you know what first of all you know
[938.32 - 942.80] that sure that's one aspect like people
[940.48 - 946.92] do grass-fed meat because it's
[942.80 - 948.60] closer to that area grass-fed it's out
[946.92 - 951.20] you know it's the free range it's you
[948.60 - 952.92] know pasture raised you know the cows
[951.20 - 955.04] are out there eating grass so if you're
[952.92 - 957.72] into meat that's the kind of get there's
[955.04 - 960.08] no doubt you don't want Factory you
[957.72 - 961.96] don't want that g garbage Factory meat
[960.08 - 964.44] that's just filled with you know GMO
[961.96 - 966.56] corn and GMO soy and the conditions are
[964.44 - 968.52] unbearable you want the grass-fed beef
[966.56 - 971.24] you know we know that if you're into
[968.52 - 973.04] meat same thing with chickens same thing
[971.24 - 975.20] with turkeys you want it all free range
[973.04 - 978.28] you want it cage free you want all of
[975.20 - 980.88] that and hopefully even grass you know
[978.28 - 982.76] free pasture raised and so uh the
[980.88 - 984.56] chickens and the turkeys can eat little
[982.76 - 986.72] bits of seeds and stuff that are
[984.56 - 988.28] naturally in the wild and grass seeds
[986.72 - 991.76] and everything else that they pluck out
[988.28 - 995.76] of the ground and bugs and insects
[991.76 - 998.92] because you want that wild attachment to
[995.76 - 1002.00] it but what about the greens the greens
[998.92 - 1003.64] have to be there no matter what you like
[1002.00 - 1005.68] talking to other person are like I only
[1003.64 - 1007.20] like fish it's say everything from the
[1005.68 - 1009.72] ocean is what I like well I said you
[1007.20 - 1012.72] better not be doing the tuna you better
[1009.72 - 1014.60] not be doing the tuna no tuna for you
[1012.72 - 1016.92] they're like well I love tuna I do you
[1014.60 - 1018.48] know I go out and get sushi and I do the
[1016.92 - 1021.04] tuna that's what the person will say to
[1018.48 - 1023.64] you know said to me and I said well okay
[1021.04 - 1025.64] you're okay sure you know you like you
[1023.64 - 1028.76] like the tuna okay fine well you better
[1025.64 - 1032.00] then be eating a lot of greens and
[1028.76 - 1035.36] preferably herbal greens like
[1032.00 - 1038.24] cantro and parsley to bind on to all
[1035.36 - 1040.20] that excess Mercury you're leaving in
[1038.24 - 1043.08] your intestinal tract colon in liver
[1040.20 - 1044.32] from that tuna and like I never never
[1043.08 - 1047.32] thought about that I don't really eat
[1044.32 - 1048.72] many greens I'm worried about my protein
[1047.32 - 1050.36] you know so it's everybody's worried
[1048.72 - 1052.08] about protein protein protein and
[1050.36 - 1054.16] they're not eating any greens do you
[1052.08 - 1057.32] guys get what I'm going there do you see
[1054.16 - 1060.12] what I'm saying do you see what I'm
[1057.32 - 1064.16] saying you know what I mean because
[1060.12 - 1068.80] where's the most powerful protein there
[1064.16 - 1071.80] is on the planet that actually does do a
[1068.80 - 1076.44] lot for the human body where does that
[1071.80 - 1080.24] lie it lies in Greens it's in spinach
[1076.44 - 1083.36] it's in kale it's in parsley you know
[1080.24 - 1085.68] it's in it's in barley
[1083.36 - 1088.52] grass I like the barley grass cheese pow
[1085.68 - 1090.28] it's in that it's in all of that that's
[1088.52 - 1092.96] where those those
[1090.28 - 1094.92] microproteins they're simulatable they
[1092.96 - 1097.32] absorb they break down they do things
[1094.92 - 1098.76] they got amino acids attached to them
[1097.32 - 1101.88] actively
[1098.76 - 1103.24] bioactiv so you want those proteins I
[1101.88 - 1105.00] tell people look okay sure you're
[1103.24 - 1106.72] getting a lot of protein from fish I I I
[1105.00 - 1108.08] okay I'm with you I'm not I'm not you
[1106.72 - 1111.48] know fighting you on that but where's
[1108.08 - 1112.36] your where's your bioidentical protein
[1111.48 - 1114.04] you know and they're like what are you
[1112.36 - 1118.56] talking about I go you know from the
[1114.04 - 1119.96] greens from the greens and so you know
[1118.56 - 1121.68] so so if you want to do fish make sure
[1119.96 - 1123.56] you do a salad with that fish you want
[1121.68 - 1125.36] to do tuna you better have that Tuna on
[1123.56 - 1128.24] top of a big salad so if you guys like
[1125.36 - 1130.84] tuna regardless of the Mercury I I'll
[1128.24 - 1133.24] stand behind you but put it in a big
[1130.84 - 1135.08] salad you know if you guys like
[1133.24 - 1137.28] grass-fed beef because you guys are into
[1135.08 - 1139.52] that kind of diet I stand behind you
[1137.28 - 1142.64] let's get a with let's make sure we have
[1139.52 - 1145.16] a nice salad of leafy greens going on
[1142.64 - 1146.80] there you guys are into Wild game like I
[1145.16 - 1148.52] run into you know a few people here and
[1146.80 - 1150.64] there it's just everything is wild wild
[1148.52 - 1152.72] turkey whatever they can find then you
[1150.64 - 1154.96] know wild pheasants they order them they
[1152.72 - 1156.20] ship them you ship them they ship Frozen
[1154.96 - 1159.32] or something now you can get wild
[1156.20 - 1161.88] pheasants then then yeah then where's
[1159.32 - 1163.88] your greens though where's your
[1161.88 - 1165.48] greens because that's what the pheasants
[1163.88 - 1169.32] were eating Where's your green you've
[1165.48 - 1171.60] got you know that has to be in the mix
[1169.32 - 1171.60] the
[1171.72 - 1176.56] bioidentical proteins that will actually
[1174.68 - 1179.60] help the animal proteins work better for
[1176.56 - 1181.64] you so the protein in the fish is going
[1179.60 - 1185.20] to work better for you when you actually
[1181.64 - 1186.60] have your greens the protein in the wild
[1185.20 - 1188.12] turkey it's going to work for you when
[1186.60 - 1189.96] you have your greens the protein in the
[1188.12 - 1191.88] wild game or whatever the grassed beef
[1189.96 - 1194.88] you name it it's going to work better
[1191.88 - 1197.12] for you and then if you're a vegan or a
[1194.88 - 1199.48] vegetarian I tell vegans and vegetarians
[1197.12 - 1203.04] all the time you better eating a lot of
[1199.48 - 1205.80] greens they better be there you can't
[1203.04 - 1207.84] you can't not have them in there you
[1205.80 - 1209.44] know I mean fruits are critical in our
[1207.84 - 1210.60] life I don't care who's eating what diet
[1209.44 - 1211.88] you got to get some fruit in there if
[1210.60 - 1213.32] you want longevity because of
[1211.88 - 1215.40] antioxidants you want your you don't
[1213.32 - 1217.44] want your brain to rot and oxidize you
[1215.40 - 1220.08] better be eating fruit it's not about a
[1217.44 - 1222.08] belief system it's not about sugar no
[1220.08 - 1224.80] sugar fruit's bad fruit's not bad no
[1222.08 - 1226.80] it's about longevity it's about making
[1224.80 - 1228.32] sure your butt makes it all the way to
[1226.80 - 1231.44] the end and that's going to happen
[1228.32 - 1235.08] antioxidants and fruits but
[1231.44 - 1239.52] greens have mineral salts in them
[1235.08 - 1240.76] mineral salts in them critical ones and
[1239.52 - 1243.20] critical
[1240.76 - 1246.00] proteins they do critical proteins and
[1243.20 - 1247.32] mineral salts so I tell vegans and
[1246.00 - 1249.16] vegetarians you better be eating your
[1247.32 - 1251.96] leafy greens I want a spinach salad
[1249.16 - 1255.12] going on I want a spinach smoothie throw
[1251.96 - 1256.84] some tomatoes in a blender with one to
[1255.12 - 1259.84] two bunches of
[1256.84 - 1261.52] spinach okay or a container of spinach
[1259.84 - 1263.40] shove it in that you know Vitamix or
[1261.52 - 1266.08] whatever you like using throw in three
[1263.40 - 1269.36] or four good siiz tomatoes one celery
[1266.08 - 1271.00] stick it's a little handful of cilantro
[1269.36 - 1273.84] one clove of
[1271.00 - 1276.16] garlic and if you if you like garlic
[1273.84 - 1278.24] okay if you like garlic a squeeze of an
[1276.16 - 1280.88] orange get some orange juice squeezed
[1278.24 - 1283.52] fresh from an orange in there and blend
[1280.88 - 1285.84] it up grind that baby up and you got
[1283.52 - 1287.64] yourself a living fresh spinach soup if
[1285.84 - 1290.32] you're into living Foods if you're a
[1287.64 - 1292.48] vegan if you're plant-based then that's
[1290.32 - 1294.28] the that's what you need right there
[1292.48 - 1295.32] that has to be in between everything
[1294.28 - 1297.64] else you're
[1295.32 - 1299.40] eating and if you're into animal
[1297.64 - 1301.96] products then get that spinach salad
[1299.40 - 1305.16] going now don't don't grill that spinach
[1301.96 - 1307.92] don't Grill it don't throw it in a pot
[1305.16 - 1310.08] and steam it up no no but have a spinach
[1307.92 - 1311.72] salad if you want some grassed beef make
[1310.08 - 1313.24] sure you're you you're doing enough
[1311.72 - 1315.32] spinach
[1313.24 - 1319.12] salad get the
[1315.32 - 1320.76] greens so it's about making sure you're
[1319.12 - 1322.88] getting something no matter what that
[1320.76 - 1325.60] you're supposed to get that's helping
[1322.88 - 1327.28] you no matter what diet you choose for
[1325.60 - 1329.80] your health or what diet you've been
[1327.28 - 1332.20] pushed into you know from you know uh
[1329.80 - 1333.68] something out there some kind of pseudo
[1332.20 - 1335.68] science telling you why you need to eat
[1333.68 - 1338.84] a certain way or some kind of you know
[1335.68 - 1341.72] prehistoric science that really is just
[1338.84 - 1343.44] isn't just accurate so whatever it is
[1341.72 - 1346.92] that's going on just make sure the
[1343.44 - 1348.28] greens are in there bottom line you know
[1346.92 - 1349.92] whether you're vegan whe whether you're
[1348.28 - 1351.52] a Paleo whether you're whatever whether
[1349.92 - 1352.68] you're what whatever brand you're doing
[1351.52 - 1355.44] Mediterranean whether you're doing
[1352.68 - 1358.36] Atkins whatever you're doing so the deal
[1355.44 - 1360.40] is is make sure the greens are in there
[1358.36 - 1362.52] so okay I'm glad we covered that we're
[1360.40 - 1364.92] going to cover a lot of things now
[1362.52 - 1368.12] there's something there's a big
[1364.92 - 1370.76] confusion a big confusion out there
[1368.12 - 1373.52] about the brain and we're going to do a
[1370.76 - 1375.76] brain show that that is coming up but
[1373.52 - 1377.76] there's a big confusion about the brain
[1375.76 - 1381.00] and I I want to make sure we clear it up
[1377.76 - 1384.28] here here we clear it up now because
[1381.00 - 1386.88] it's important now if I say what's your
[1384.28 - 1388.88] brain made out of what are you guys
[1386.88 - 1391.04] going to say what are you guys going to
[1388.88 - 1393.92] think all right so what's your brain
[1391.04 - 1395.88] made out of what are you thinking you
[1393.92 - 1397.56] thinking are you thinking what it's made
[1395.88 - 1400.84] out
[1397.56 - 1403.12] of my first my first thing to say would
[1400.84 - 1404.64] be it's made out of brain but I'm just
[1403.12 - 1406.20] being silly that's just to me always
[1404.64 - 1408.52] being silly but what do you guys think
[1406.20 - 1410.96] it's made out of well there's a lot of
[1408.52 - 1413.44] transends and fads right now that have
[1410.96 - 1415.08] pretty much telling us oh your brain is
[1413.44 - 1421.64] made out of
[1415.08 - 1425.52] fat not n not okay the brain's not made
[1421.64 - 1427.48] out of fat it's not the brain's made out
[1425.52 - 1432.04] of glycogen
[1427.48 - 1435.20] storage glycogen storage okay that's
[1432.04 - 1436.88] what it's made out of it's made out of
[1435.20 - 1438.64] stored
[1436.88 - 1441.60] carbohydrates
[1438.64 - 1445.64] that's what it's made out
[1441.60 - 1446.84] of it melts in your mouth if someone
[1445.64 - 1449.32] eats
[1446.84 - 1454.00] it it's
[1449.32 - 1456.16] sweet and it's like basically a brown
[1454.00 - 1457.92] rice pasta if you guys ever eaten a
[1456.16 - 1460.60] brown rice pasta now I haven't eaten
[1457.92 - 1462.92] brain but I'm telling you right now a
[1460.60 - 1465.60] lot of people eat brains out there they
[1462.92 - 1467.28] eat sheep's brains and lamb brains and
[1465.60 - 1469.20] and all kinds of different animal brains
[1467.28 - 1471.76] out there cow brains there's cowb brains
[1469.20 - 1473.56] and supplements don't take those don't
[1471.76 - 1475.20] take those supplements by the way don't
[1473.56 - 1477.68] take any supplements with any animal
[1475.20 - 1479.12] parts in them because it's always
[1477.68 - 1481.32] questionable about where those animal
[1479.12 - 1485.52] parts came from cuz supplement companies
[1481.32 - 1487.76] have to Chin every penny and every dime
[1485.52 - 1491.36] in order to survive and I just never
[1487.76 - 1494.64] trust where sources lie um but the point
[1491.36 - 1496.92] is is that people eat brain out there
[1494.64 - 1500.24] they do all across the world in
[1496.92 - 1503.16] different places I've heard from many
[1500.24 - 1504.96] accounts many accounts even had a friend
[1503.16 - 1507.76] that tried brain when they were
[1504.96 - 1511.20] traveling and it was
[1507.76 - 1516.08] sweet sweet is what it
[1511.20 - 1517.84] was okay it was like not candy sweet
[1516.08 - 1521.36] carbohydrate
[1517.84 - 1523.56] sweet and science already knew this is
[1521.36 - 1526.04] what I love about science science can be
[1523.56 - 1528.28] twisted in every way in every angle in
[1526.04 - 1530.52] any direction for any reason for
[1528.28 - 1533.48] anybody's purpose at any time and that's
[1530.52 - 1535.36] why spirit and I kind of back away from
[1533.48 - 1536.64] science and spir I always say Spirit
[1535.36 - 1539.60] trumps
[1536.64 - 1541.36] science and because it's about results
[1539.60 - 1542.80] and about truth and it's about truth and
[1541.36 - 1545.12] it's not about propaganda and it's not
[1542.80 - 1549.40] about interest groups spirit is above
[1545.12 - 1552.28] that but the point is is that the brain
[1549.40 - 1555.00] once was that was discovered it's
[1552.28 - 1557.88] glycogen that was a correct Discovery
[1555.00 - 1560.36] and then it flipped later on like like
[1557.88 - 1562.92] just recently with fads and Trends where
[1560.36 - 1564.52] we're now convinced that it's made out
[1562.92 - 1566.88] of fat now it's not made out of fat
[1564.52 - 1570.72] there are traces of Omega-3s plus traces
[1566.88 - 1576.28] of other rare oils in the
[1570.72 - 1579.64] brain rare rare oils and fats traces
[1576.28 - 1585.32] only and those traces come from hemp
[1579.64 - 1589.24] seeds walnuts they come from butterleaf
[1585.32 - 1593.44] lettuce they come from Black
[1589.24 - 1597.00] berries they come from wild blueberries
[1593.44 - 1599.16] traces of Mega 3s in them and other rare
[1597.00 - 1600.76] omegas I'm I'm not just even talking
[1599.16 - 1604.80] about three sixes and nines I'm talking
[1600.76 - 1607.52] about rare not even identified yet
[1604.80 - 1609.20] groups of omegas not
[1607.52 - 1610.88] nonidentified that's what's cool about
[1609.20 - 1614.72] the life-changing Foods book is I just
[1610.88 - 1618.80] love going into the stuff by the way um
[1614.72 - 1621.84] so so basically that's in the brain but
[1618.80 - 1626.12] it only accounts for a tiny percentage
[1621.84 - 1627.64] of the brain the rest of it is
[1626.12 - 1633.08] salt
[1627.64 - 1634.56] salt okay salt and sugar sugar the
[1633.08 - 1636.32] brain's made out of sugar but it's made
[1634.56 - 1638.36] out of a carbohydrate polysaccharide is
[1636.32 - 1642.08] made out of glycogen
[1638.36 - 1644.28] glycogen a polysaccharide a a starch a
[1642.08 - 1646.84] carbohydrate a
[1644.28 - 1649.00] starch I'm just trying to get this point
[1646.84 - 1651.08] across
[1649.00 - 1653.32] because we need to know what the brain's
[1651.08 - 1656.04] made out of because when you're dealing
[1653.32 - 1657.36] with vegetables one of the Holy four
[1656.04 - 1658.60] when you're dealing with vegetables you
[1657.36 - 1661.12] got to know what you're dealing with and
[1658.60 - 1662.28] you're dealing with precious vital
[1661.12 - 1665.84] mineral
[1662.28 - 1667.76] salts mineral salts for neurotransmitter
[1665.84 - 1669.64] chemicals actually to create
[1667.76 - 1673.00] neurotransmitter chemicals to be a
[1669.64 - 1675.88] neurotransmitter chemicals and amino
[1673.00 - 1677.80] acids precious life-giving amino acids
[1675.88 - 1681.52] are in vegetables the ones that go to
[1677.80 - 1683.88] the brain and charge up the electro the
[1681.52 - 1688.36] the um charge up electrolytes charge up
[1683.88 - 1690.48] electrical impulses fire up GLE cells so
[1688.36 - 1692.36] this is serious stuff this is vegetables
[1690.48 - 1693.92] so you know I was telling you like well
[1692.36 - 1695.40] you got to eat your vegetables when
[1693.92 - 1699.04] you're told as a child it's important to
[1695.40 - 1701.72] eat your vegetables but why this is why
[1699.04 - 1703.84] this is why because if you don't eat
[1701.72 - 1707.80] your vegetables you won't have the
[1703.84 - 1710.16] conductor the conductor for the brain
[1707.80 - 1712.96] which is part of the electricity which
[1710.16 - 1717.80] is all the precious vital mineral salts
[1712.96 - 1720.04] and if you don't eat fruits or starchy
[1717.80 - 1722.80] vegetables or vegetables that have
[1720.04 - 1726.28] carbohydrates in them if you don't eat
[1722.80 - 1729.24] those you won't have a glycogen storage
[1726.28 - 1731.28] a glucose storage in the brain a sugar
[1729.24 - 1734.72] storage in the
[1731.28 - 1737.24] brain that gives you a brain because
[1734.72 - 1738.68] your brain's made out of that I don't
[1737.24 - 1740.48] care care what book comes around the
[1738.68 - 1744.00] corner tomorrow I don't care what
[1740.48 - 1746.08] concept I don't care what person expert
[1744.00 - 1747.72] says oh no no the brain's made out of
[1746.08 - 1748.84] fat you got to keep away from your sugar
[1747.72 - 1752.00] you know what's going to happen your
[1748.84 - 1755.40] brain is going to shrink your brain
[1752.00 - 1759.00] shrinks and shrivels up without glycogen
[1755.40 - 1762.16] which is carbohydrates which is out
[1759.00 - 1763.92] glucose and then without the conductor
[1762.16 - 1767.60] the mineral
[1763.92 - 1769.44] salts that's a fact Jack that's a fact
[1767.60 - 1771.40] Jack so when you're getting pushed
[1769.44 - 1773.32] around in the diet world and the food
[1771.40 - 1776.04] worlds you better be you know thinking
[1773.32 - 1778.48] about these things because it's all
[1776.04 - 1782.12] about watching your back it's all about
[1778.48 - 1783.72] being on your side you know and it's not
[1782.12 - 1785.60] about anything else it's not about
[1783.72 - 1788.40] selling a
[1785.60 - 1790.52] product it's not about selling a product
[1788.40 - 1791.64] I don't have 50,000 products to sell you
[1790.52 - 1794.04] because you know I'm telling you that
[1791.64 - 1795.56] the brain's mad out of fat it's not that
[1794.04 - 1797.68] at all it's about what's going to help
[1795.56 - 1800.68] you your family your children your
[1797.68 - 1803.00] grandchildren your grandparents your
[1800.68 - 1805.32] parents it's just about we got to do
[1803.00 - 1806.96] this together so let's talk about some
[1805.32 - 1809.48] vegetables let's talk about it
[1806.96 - 1813.12] vegetables provide these mineral salts
[1809.48 - 1815.80] they provide these critical things that
[1813.12 - 1819.20] actually give us life it gives us a
[1815.80 - 1822.00] brain a brain is made out of literally
[1819.20 - 1825.12] these mineral salts and then
[1822.00 - 1828.44] carbohydrate that's what our brain is
[1825.12 - 1829.72] made out of how do you like that how do
[1828.44 - 1832.40] you like them
[1829.72 - 1834.00] apples so let's go into some of these
[1832.40 - 1836.72] because it's really important to go into
[1834.00 - 1838.92] some of these um talk about the leafy
[1836.72 - 1842.00] greens what can leafy greens do for us
[1838.92 - 1844.20] what can they help they can totally help
[1842.00 - 1846.04] acidosis right when our body systems
[1844.20 - 1848.56] become so acidic that disease State
[1846.04 - 1850.56] happens and occurs that means that any
[1848.56 - 1852.20] viruses bacteria pathogens in you they
[1850.56 - 1854.00] want to take over they got a better
[1852.20 - 1856.32] opportunity to take over if you're if
[1854.00 - 1859.00] you're really acidic if you're eating
[1856.32 - 1861.84] you know just no vegetables and no fruit
[1859.00 - 1864.24] you get really acidic so any kind of
[1861.84 - 1865.72] heartburn it prevents heartburn it may
[1864.24 - 1867.96] not fix it on the spot right when you
[1865.72 - 1869.80] eat your first Leaf of lettuce but it's
[1867.96 - 1872.88] going to help it in a long time not
[1869.80 - 1874.92] occur okay iron deficiencies especially
[1872.88 - 1877.64] do do by viruses like Epstein bar
[1874.92 - 1880.04] creates the iron deficiencies out there
[1877.64 - 1881.92] so you got lettu uses to help that you
[1880.04 - 1884.28] know like lettu uses and leafy greens
[1881.92 - 1886.28] could butter leaf lettuce Romain leaf
[1884.28 - 1888.00] lettuce red leaf lettuce someone told me
[1886.28 - 1891.04] recently they said I like red leaf
[1888.00 - 1893.56] lettuce I said you know what I'm with
[1891.04 - 1896.12] you let's do it let's do it just red
[1893.56 - 1899.36] leaf lettuce just every day have some
[1896.12 - 1901.36] red leaf lettuce and you know and and if
[1899.36 - 1903.76] that's the one you like that's the one
[1901.36 - 1906.80] you like I'm not a big Iceberg fan I'm
[1903.76 - 1908.44] not a big iceberg lettuce fan okay I
[1906.80 - 1911.80] remember being a kid when Spirit was
[1908.44 - 1913.40] telling me in a grocery store you know I
[1911.80 - 1914.88] I don't know you you guys might know the
[1913.40 - 1917.32] story but you know I used to work in a
[1914.88 - 1920.16] grocery store when I was 14 years old
[1917.32 - 1921.76] and I was stocking shelves and um I just
[1920.16 - 1923.88] needed something to do to take my mind
[1921.76 - 1926.12] off of spirit and but of course Spirit
[1923.88 - 1927.88] would actually you know tell every every
[1926.12 - 1930.64] single Shopper that was there in the
[1927.88 - 1931.88] store pushing their cart by Spirit would
[1930.64 - 1933.72] tell me what was going on with their
[1931.88 - 1935.04] health what they needed for food and
[1933.72 - 1936.48] that's where I built up my first
[1935.04 - 1940.52] clientele at age
[1936.48 - 1942.96] 14 and and and so um so I go around the
[1940.52 - 1944.76] store even the owner of the store was a
[1942.96 - 1948.80] client of mine the owner of the store it
[1944.76 - 1950.52] was a big grocery store and um so and he
[1948.80 - 1952.68] he became the client of mine because it
[1950.52 - 1954.92] was inconceivable of how I would know he
[1952.68 - 1954.92] had
[1954.96 - 1960.68] gout you well because of spirit of
[1957.28 - 1963.24] course anyway the the whole thing is the
[1960.68 - 1965.04] whole thing is is that iceberg lettuce
[1963.24 - 1968.28] was like the only thing on the Shelf
[1965.04 - 1970.00] back then practically I'm serious it was
[1968.28 - 1971.44] I mean depending where you were like I
[1970.00 - 1973.12] said if you were in California that
[1971.44 - 1975.88] would be an exception everywhere where
[1973.12 - 1980.00] else in the United States it was iceberg
[1975.88 - 1981.36] lettuce and and I hated it I hated it
[1980.00 - 1982.96] cuz it was iceberg lettuce because
[1981.36 - 1985.40] Spirit would say well there's not a lot
[1982.96 - 1986.56] in here and it was conventional iceberg
[1985.40 - 1988.96] lettuce and spirit would tell me there's
[1986.56 - 1991.08] not a lot in here but spirit said to me
[1988.96 - 1993.08] you wait you wait and see what happens
[1991.08 - 1995.56] down the road all right so you want to
[1993.08 - 1998.64] get your different Roma lettuce you know
[1995.56 - 2000.80] red leaf lettuce green leaf uh um get
[1998.64 - 2003.00] the masculine mix with all the different
[2000.80 - 2004.60] little mixes they even have the you know
[2003.00 - 2008.44] the riko they have all these different
[2004.60 - 2011.20] things MH you name it get what you can
[2008.44 - 2013.28] spinach any leafy greens you can they
[2011.20 - 2015.92] help with mineral deficiencies Trace
[2013.28 - 2019.44] mineral deficiencies swelling fluid
[2015.92 - 2021.92] retention edema inflamed liver
[2019.44 - 2024.28] everybody's liver is getting inflamed in
[2021.92 - 2027.40] this day and age you need the leafy
[2024.28 - 2030.68] greens food allergies starts to knock
[2027.40 - 2032.52] down food allergies spasms and cramps
[2030.68 - 2034.48] because of the mineral salts have traces
[2032.52 - 2036.60] of magnesium that are even better than
[2034.48 - 2039.16] magnesium supplements how do you like
[2036.60 - 2041.28] that how do you like them bananas or how
[2039.16 - 2043.92] do you like them leafy greens huh
[2041.28 - 2045.60] instead of them apples all right helps
[2043.92 - 2048.32] with weight gain because helps clean up
[2045.60 - 2051.92] the liver any kind of menopause symptoms
[2048.32 - 2054.36] premenstrual symp symptoms um PMS
[2051.92 - 2056.12] hormonal imbalances lettu uses help
[2054.36 - 2057.56] because they help clean up the liver
[2056.12 - 2059.24] which is causing a lot of the problem
[2057.56 - 2060.72] they help knock down Epstein bar which
[2059.24 - 2062.80] is causing a lot of these symptoms in
[2060.72 - 2066.00] women and being completely overlooked we
[2062.80 - 2067.92] talk about that um stops calcifications
[2066.00 - 2069.32] in the breast
[2067.92 - 2071.44] there's so many calcifications in
[2069.32 - 2073.12] women's breast it's there all the time
[2071.44 - 2074.60] you know no matter where I go spirit's
[2073.12 - 2076.96] telling me okay calcification in the
[2074.60 - 2079.28] breast nodu on the thyroid calcification
[2076.96 - 2081.72] on the kidney calcification in the lower
[2079.28 - 2083.92] back calcification in the joints I mean
[2081.72 - 2087.12] the calcifications are just out of
[2083.92 - 2089.96] control um so you know this is all the
[2087.12 - 2091.52] power of leafy greens leafy greens hold
[2089.96 - 2095.04] great
[2091.52 - 2097.04] power and it it's actually an incredible
[2095.04 - 2100.40] incredible experience to bring these
[2097.04 - 2101.72] into your life so there's something
[2100.40 - 2104.52] there's something that I really love
[2101.72 - 2107.92] another thing another vegetable
[2104.52 - 2109.64] radishes radishes who's eating radishes
[2107.92 - 2112.68] are you guys eating any radishes did you
[2109.64 - 2115.96] know when you have your salad and you
[2112.68 - 2118.32] have a SL slice of radish on top that
[2115.96 - 2121.08] that radish is probably one of the most
[2118.32 - 2122.60] powerful things on top of that salad I
[2121.08 - 2124.80] mean even with all those leafy greens
[2122.60 - 2126.28] around the radish is a medicine it's a
[2124.80 - 2129.32] different kind of medicine it's like
[2126.28 - 2131.12] having a pill that you think is you know
[2129.32 - 2133.12] really valuable in the pharmaceutical
[2131.12 - 2135.72] world that's a medicine it's like having
[2133.12 - 2139.80] that pill sitting on top of your salad
[2135.72 - 2142.52] you know um so anyway uh the radish is
[2139.80 - 2146.28] even more powerful than that of course
[2142.52 - 2148.64] so radishes are like a little miracle
[2146.28 - 2151.32] the greens on top are practically a wild
[2148.64 - 2152.96] food so when you shop for radishes the
[2151.32 - 2154.80] farmers market right now or wherever you
[2152.96 - 2156.52] go and farmers markets are loaded with
[2154.80 - 2158.56] radishes right now at least North
[2156.52 - 2161.56] America whatever they just load it with
[2158.56 - 2163.00] radishes and you know grab radishes
[2161.56 - 2164.40] where you got the greens attached where
[2163.00 - 2165.68] you can chop up the greens throw them
[2164.40 - 2169.04] into your salad and then you got the
[2165.68 - 2170.60] leafy greens again but another powerful
[2169.04 - 2172.44] one but then you chop up the radishes
[2170.60 - 2173.32] you put those in your salads put radish

[2242.84 - 2247.08] the whole bit we know that's a diagnosis
[2244.72 - 2249.84] doctors still don't understand but he
[2247.08 - 2251.72] was given the diagnosis of ALS and he
[2249.84 - 2254.32] really had a severe neurological
[2251.72 - 2256.84] condition and that's unknown to medical
[2254.32 - 2260.24] research and medical science but Spirit
[2256.84 - 2264.16] knew um he had to eat eight radishes
[2260.24 - 2265.76] every single day eight radishes daily
[2264.16 - 2268.72] and he improved
[2265.76 - 2272.36] 50% when the only other way he was going
[2268.72 - 2275.52] was opposite and fast and he improved

[2294.40 - 2298.32] about of what causes it but just
[2296.40 - 2301.00] inflammation in general radishes tend to
[2298.32 - 2303.68] be an anti-inflammatory like a medicine

[2337.84 - 2344.80] about when failing is a word in your
[2341.08 - 2346.68] life when when fail is a key word of how

[2350.36 - 2354.32] I feel like I can't save the world and
[2352.48 - 2356.92] all at once I wake up in the morning and
[2354.32 - 2359.12] I want to kick myself in the butt and
[2356.92 - 2361.44] and feel like I'm failing because I'm
[2359.12 - 2362.88] only reaching so many when you know

[2385.04 - 2389.36] fall into that it's a bad place to fall
[2387.72 - 2391.52] into first of all it's not true we're
[2389.36 - 2394.56] not failures second of all bring
[2391.52 - 2396.52] radishes in and it changes the mindset

[2418.64 - 2424.40] Foods incredible Foods so keep these in
[2421.44 - 2425.80] your life and the conditions they help
[2424.40 - 2428.20] is also there's a whole bunch of
[2425.80 - 2430.12] varieties of conditions that they help
[2428.20 - 2432.72] they help with acne with knocking down
[2430.12 - 2435.04] strep that we talk about help with
[2432.72 - 2437.08] diabetes they help with with Hashimoto
[2435.04 - 2438.96] thyroiditis cruciferous vegetables
[2437.08 - 2441.56] actually stop Hashimoto so don't fall
[2438.96 - 2443.48] into that whole mistake that that trend
[2441.56 - 2445.36] of goitrogenic being a problem if you're
[2443.48 - 2447.80] new to my information and you just
[2445.36 - 2449.92] logged on to this first time learn about
[2447.80 - 2453.20] it read about it or listen to what I've
[2449.92 - 2455.04] talked about before and um because don't
[2453.20 - 2456.80] fall into that goitrogenic mistake
[2455.04 - 2459.44] that's out there terrible because it's
[2456.80 - 2462.48] not true um there's phytochemicals
[2459.44 - 2465.08] undiscovered in these vegetables that
[2462.48 - 2467.48] stop those cogenic properties from being
[2465.08 - 2469.44] a problem and stop thyroid issues
[2467.48 - 2471.28] because first of all you need to know
[2469.44 - 2473.32] what's wrong with the thyroid to even
[2471.28 - 2474.80] know how to treat it or how to to
[2473.32 - 2476.08] address it and apparently medical
[2474.80 - 2477.96] research and medical science both
[2476.08 - 2479.84] alternatively and conventionally doesn't
[2477.96 - 2482.20] know yet up until I brought it to the
[2479.84 - 2484.28] table that Epstein bar causes Hashimoto
[2482.20 - 2486.44] and to kill off Epstein bar you need
[2484.28 - 2488.12] certain things cruciferous vegetables
[2486.44 - 2489.84] one of them so you keep the kale in
[2488.12 - 2493.40] there keep the collards in there you
[2489.84 - 2496.84] keep all of that going on um I like the
[2493.40 - 2498.84] emotional support of these vegetables
[2496.84 - 2501.68] that's what I like they're really
[2498.84 - 2503.12] amazing like like for instance okay if
[2501.68 - 2505.44] you know if you know anybody that's
[2503.12 - 2508.16] baffled all the time or bewildered or
[2505.44 - 2509.88] befuddled or just you know confused if
[2508.16 - 2512.12] you know somebody that's struggling with
[2509.88 - 2513.52] that and you know you want them to get
[2512.12 - 2515.64] the support they need just get them
[2513.52 - 2518.80] eating more broccoli getting them eating
[2515.64 - 2521.64] more cul flour because the mineral salts
[2518.80 - 2524.12] in here not only support the brain but
[2521.64 - 2526.24] they help an emotional part of the brain
[2524.12 - 2529.28] so this is an emotional support
[2526.24 - 2531.00] vegetable group that helps helps people
[2529.28 - 2532.28] get out of that always seem like they're
[2531.00 - 2533.60] confused always seem like they're
[2532.28 - 2535.60] baffled always seem like they're
[2533.60 - 2538.04] bewildered even if they're brilliant
[2535.60 - 2541.12] people of course and they have this
[2538.04 - 2543.04] going on you want these vegetables keep
[2541.12 - 2545.00] that in mind um these vegetables are
[2543.04 - 2548.16] also amazing for weight gain issues
[2545.00 - 2550.88] where you you want the weight off um
[2548.16 - 2553.64] hyperthyroid they're amazing for that
[2550.88 - 2555.84] inflammation all through the body you

[2577.08 - 2582.24] so it's one of the Holy four it's one of
[2579.32 - 2583.92] that group of the groups that I talk
[2582.24 - 2586.60] about in life-changing Foods you guys

[2589.84 - 2594.40] celery juice 16 ounces of celery juice
[2591.84 - 2597.08] because of the nature of the mineral
[2594.40 - 2599.20] salts the nature of the blend which is
[2597.08 - 2601.92] undiscovered by research and science
[2599.20 - 2605.48] totally undiscovered food hasn't even
[2601.92 - 2608.40] been tapped into you guys by on any
[2605.48 - 2610.08] level by research and science any level
[2608.40 - 2612.24] compared to what what's in it as far as
[2610.08 - 2614.72] phytochemicals mineral salts Spirit
[2612.24 - 2617.16] jumps ahead of all that cuz by the time
[2614.72 - 2618.60] they tap into some of that it's 40 years

[2623.88 - 2628.12] I'm not going to be here in 50 years so
[2626.40 - 2631.56] the bottom line is I hope I'm going to
[2628.12 - 2634.40] but I don't think so and uh for 60 years
[2631.56 - 2636.80] or whatever so the deal is is that we
