[116.72 - 119.68] guys take a look i got a nice
[118.24 - 121.28] cauliflower
[119.68 - 124.40] i don't know if how good you can see
[121.28 - 127.92] that with the lighting but there it is
[124.40 - 129.84] and so i'm to
[127.92 - 131.04] use a lot of this i'm going to start
[129.84 - 132.88] with about a half of it
[131.04 - 135.04] i'm going to cut the florets florets are
[132.88 - 138.72] going to go in the food processor
[135.04 - 140.32] um so tina says
[138.72 - 143.04] i've been drinking the heavy metal detox
[140.32 - 143.84] smoothie with botanicals feeling so
[143.04 - 146.08] clear
[143.84 - 148.88] heavy metals are transforming confusion
[146.08 - 151.20] and clarity incredible
[148.88 - 153.44] what i do is i use the vimergy so i so i
[151.20 - 155.12] know it's working it's the best there is
[153.44 - 156.72] for the heavy metal detox smoothie
[155.12 - 158.96] not sponsored by these guys but that's
[156.72 - 162.24] been reggie spirulina v is invictus i
[158.96 - 162.72] m e r g y the vimergy barley grass juice
[162.24 - 165.20] powder
[162.72 - 166.40] critical for that vermice wok blueberry
[165.20 - 168.08] powder too
[166.40 - 170.00] but that's what i use in mine and what i
[168.08 - 172.96] tell family and friends because people
[170.00 - 173.52] say how like how can i remove metals
[172.96 - 177.04] what's my
[173.52 - 178.96] best chance of removing all that
[177.04 - 181.12] copper from all those copper toxic
[178.96 - 182.88] sources removing all the mercury
[181.12 - 184.64] removing all the aluminum i'm asset all
[182.88 - 187.36] the time my family friends
[184.64 - 188.56] doctors what's my best chance and
[187.36 - 190.16] they'll say something like
[188.56 - 191.60] i got some krill i'm like that's not
[190.16 - 193.20] going to do it they won't
[191.60 - 195.44] then they'll say oh i got this other
[193.20 - 197.68] kind of spirulina i'll be like uh
[195.44 - 199.36] that spirulina is not coming from a good
[197.68 - 201.60] place or a good source
[199.36 - 203.84] and if you know when people say what's
[201.60 - 204.96] my greatest chance of getting the medals
[203.84 - 206.80] out and i'm like look
[204.96 - 208.80] this is what i do if you want to know
[206.80 - 210.48] what i do so it's the bemidji spirulina
[208.80 - 212.40] barley grass juice powder
[210.48 - 213.60] wild blueberry powder because it's
[212.40 - 215.04] important i mean
[213.60 - 217.28] it's either you do it or you don't
[215.04 - 220.40] meaning like you have the best there is
[217.28 - 222.64] or you do it half ass and that's okay i
[220.40 - 224.32] mean people do that they'll do it like
[222.64 - 225.92] now this is enough i could just do this
[224.32 - 227.92] i got enough i'll just use a little
[225.92 - 230.00] cilantro and i'm good but
[227.92 - 231.76] it's like look do you really got some
[230.00 - 233.52] stuff going on if you're really worried
[231.76 - 235.04] about your tattoos and i got to talk to
[233.52 - 236.16] you guys about the tattoos while we're
[235.04 - 237.68] cooking
[236.16 - 240.08] if you're really worried about all the
[237.68 - 242.64] different metals that we have you just
[240.08 - 243.28] i tell my friends my family let's do it
[242.64 - 245.76] right
[243.28 - 247.20] do it right because we can't avoid all
[245.76 - 249.28] the medals they're out there we get
[247.20 - 249.60] exposed to it every day we're exposed to
[249.28 - 252.56] it
[249.60 - 253.44] in every way possible all the time and
[252.56 - 256.32] that's fine
[253.44 - 258.16] that's fine but we got to do something
[256.32 - 260.80] about it at least be proactive
[258.16 - 261.92] in removing more than what's coming in
[260.80 - 264.96] so it's about removing
[261.92 - 265.28] more metals than what's coming in it's
[264.96 - 267.12] like
[265.28 - 268.80] i want more metals coming out of me than
[267.12 - 270.88] what's coming in all the time
[268.80 - 272.00] so that's really important right there
[270.88 - 275.28] and
[272.00 - 276.80] metals settle in your brain that's the
[275.28 - 279.28] number one place they
[276.80 - 281.52] all go so if you're doing
[279.28 - 282.00] pharmaceuticals pharmaceuticals got all
[281.52 - 284.48] metals
[282.00 - 286.32] in them if you're doing pharmaceuticals
[284.48 - 288.24] they go to the brain
[286.32 - 290.24] all the metals go to the brain all that
[288.24 - 293.20] titanium
[290.24 - 293.92] all of it on the mercury all of that
[293.20 - 296.56] stuff
[293.92 - 298.56] all the barium barium is in
[296.56 - 300.72] pharmaceuticals lots of barium
[298.56 - 302.96] goes to the brain and then your brain
[300.72 - 305.36] becomes a magnet
[302.96 - 307.04] for because of the electricity panel
[305.36 - 308.96] that's in your brain
[307.04 - 310.40] that electricity panel that's in your
[308.96 - 312.64] brain right
[310.40 - 314.64] becomes a magnet for more metal more
[312.64 - 317.12] metal it can't get enough it just starts
[314.64 - 318.32] to stick to all the deposits and spots
[317.12 - 320.00] right
[318.32 - 321.92] anyway we'll talk about that we got a
[320.00 - 323.84] lot to cover on all of it
[321.92 - 325.92] so if you don't have frozen wild
[323.84 - 327.44] blueberries substitute with two
[325.92 - 330.08] tablespoons
[327.44 - 332.56] of the wild blueberry powder so that's
[330.08 - 334.64] what you can do substitute
[332.56 - 336.88] see guys i'm here let's start making
[334.64 - 339.12] some stuff i got my food processor good
[336.88 - 342.16] to see you guys michelle l
[339.12 - 345.28] good to see you everybody's coming on
[342.16 - 347.04] um so i'm gonna just cut these florets
[345.28 - 348.08] up like this
[347.04 - 350.72] i'm gonna throw them in the food
[348.08 - 350.72] processor
[351.12 - 355.84] okay so i'm just kind of cutting these
[353.28 - 355.84] back a little
[357.76 - 361.44] so i'm going to pop them in here and
[359.20 - 363.92] pulse it in a minute let's talk about
[361.44 - 365.92] tattoo ink
[363.92 - 367.76] really important that's a question that
[365.92 - 370.64] came up because you guys
[367.76 - 372.80] many of you guys saw the video my tick
[370.64 - 377.68] tock video right
[372.80 - 380.16] and i rolled up my sleeves and um
[377.68 - 381.68] and it's important to be proactive if
[380.16 - 384.96] you got ink
[381.68 - 388.24] it really is because ink
[384.96 - 389.36] is a delivery system for toxic heavy
[388.24 - 391.84] metals
[389.36 - 393.60] to go to your brain and liver your whole
[391.84 - 395.12] lifetime your whole lifetime so once you
[393.60 - 397.68] get inked that's it
[395.12 - 399.12] you got it you got the ink whole
[397.68 - 401.84] lifetime right
[399.12 - 402.40] so all that metal and then i'm going to
[401.84 - 405.44] talk about
[402.40 - 409.68] oh wait i don't i don't have the toxic
[405.44 - 412.16] my ink my my tattooist my artist
[409.68 - 413.20] he says that mine is it's it's cruelty
[412.16 - 416.72] free
[413.20 - 419.76] it's animal product free it's vegan
[416.72 - 421.52] my ink is vegan it's non-toxic
[419.76 - 423.44] so anthony you're just i don't know what
[421.52 - 424.24] kind of tattoo ink you're talking about
[423.44 - 427.28] anthony
[424.24 - 430.24] is not mine my tattoo artist would never
[427.28 - 433.20] do that to me no he said it's cruelty
[430.24 - 436.88] free it's animal free it's non-toxic
[433.20 - 440.16] it's sterile it's sterile ink
[436.88 - 441.60] certified sterile and so you'll hear
[440.16 - 443.92] that right
[441.60 - 445.12] but i'm sorry to say it's got toxic
[443.92 - 446.96] heavy metals in it
[445.12 - 448.24] and a whole variety of toxic heavy
[446.96 - 450.08] metals because i'm going to drop the
[448.24 - 454.16] bomb on you right now
[450.08 - 458.72] really important to know and ink
[454.16 - 461.92] reflects off the sun and light
[458.72 - 465.12] because of toxic heavy metals they can't
[461.92 - 467.68] put ink in your arms
[465.12 - 469.52] okay like you saw in my video they can't
[467.68 - 472.08] put ink in your arms
[469.52 - 473.76] in your neck in your side if they put a
[472.08 - 475.04] little scripture on your side you know
[473.76 - 477.28] like some kind of like
[475.04 - 478.88] some kind of some scripture from buddha
[477.28 - 481.20] or something some scripture
[478.88 - 482.64] and then whatever you got on you right
[481.20 - 484.24] or some kind of you know
[482.64 - 486.40] some kind of feathers or whatever is
[484.24 - 489.04] going on that you have
[486.40 - 489.44] in order for it to show up really good
[489.04 - 493.28] and
[489.44 - 495.60] pop through the skin it has to have
[493.28 - 497.52] metals to reflect the light that's
[495.60 - 499.52] coming down to your skin
[497.52 - 501.04] so when you roll up your sleeves you
[499.52 - 502.48] pull up whatever you're wearing shorts
[501.04 - 503.76] you have them on your ankles wherever
[502.48 - 506.48] you got your ink
[503.76 - 506.80] for when light hits it in order for it
[506.48 - 509.92] to
[506.80 - 512.56] pop it has to hit the metals
[509.92 - 514.08] in the ink you see how it works that's
[512.56 - 517.68] how it pops
[514.08 - 520.56] and in all makers of ink
[517.68 - 522.16] because ink we're rich all the products
[520.56 - 524.32] from inc comes from china so it all
[522.16 - 527.60] comes from china it's all made out there
[524.32 - 529.36] then it gets shipped overseas to the us
[527.60 - 531.04] and then you know and then and they make
[529.36 - 532.56] it in the u.s too but most
[531.04 - 534.96] inks come from there at least a lot of
[532.56 - 537.68] the supplies come from there so they
[534.96 - 538.48] make it in the u.s but the supplies for
[537.68 - 540.00] the inc
[538.48 - 542.00] come from from china it's where they
[540.00 - 543.28] come from right and
[542.00 - 545.04] where you know we're where most
[543.28 - 545.84] everything comes from right you guys but
[545.04 - 549.68] what happens
[545.84 - 552.40] is that that these this ink
[549.68 - 554.40] okay is filled with metals and it's
[552.40 - 558.32] filled with a variety of metals
[554.40 - 559.76] and it has to be so that the ink pops
[558.32 - 562.00] and you're a happy customer
[559.76 - 564.56] so it's like whoa that looks so good i
[562.00 - 566.64] got some colors in there it looks great
[564.56 - 568.72] you're a happy customer and it's to make
[566.64 - 570.72] it so it pops for years
[568.72 - 572.56] eventually you get older of course and
[570.72 - 574.88] the ink starts to not look as great
[572.56 - 575.60] doesn't pop as much because your skin
[574.88 - 577.20] kind of
[575.60 - 578.96] what happens is it gets buried deeper
[577.20 - 580.80] into the derma it goes deeper into the
[578.96 - 582.08] derma and it sinks deeper into the derma
[580.80 - 584.56] but what happens is
[582.08 - 586.48] these metals leach into your bloodstream
[584.56 - 588.32] for your entire life
[586.48 - 590.96] and hey that's all right i mean that's
[588.32 - 592.72] okay i'm not i'm not trying to scare you
[590.96 - 596.64] that's not it i'm just saying
[592.72 - 598.96] that that you got to be proactive
[596.64 - 600.64] because all that metal goes to your
[598.96 - 602.80] brain i don't care who tells you
[600.64 - 604.16] no it's non-toxic no there's no heavy
[602.80 - 607.12] metals in my ink
[604.16 - 607.60] um it's it's cruelty free it's non-toxic
[607.12 - 609.76] no
[607.60 - 611.76] it's got solvents in it it's got other
[609.76 - 614.88] poisons and chemicals in it
[611.76 - 618.64] the best ink there is on the market has
[614.88 - 621.36] solvents and poisons in it it does
[618.64 - 622.40] it's okay it just does it's got toxic
[621.36 - 625.52] heavy metals in it
[622.40 - 627.68] it just does and so
[625.52 - 629.60] keep in mind that that's all right it's
[627.68 - 630.80] not about getting rid of your tattoos
[629.60 - 633.04] it's not about trying to get your
[630.80 - 635.04] tattoos removed no not at all
[633.04 - 636.80] i don't recommend that i don't i don't
[635.04 - 638.40] recommend you trying to get them removed
[636.80 - 640.00] i don't recommend you try to do anything
[638.40 - 642.64] like that that's not it
[640.00 - 644.00] it's just what i recommend is being
[642.64 - 646.96] proactive
[644.00 - 648.96] get your metals out of your bloodstream
[646.96 - 650.08] get them out of your organs and your
[648.96 - 652.72] skin
[650.08 - 653.76] is one of those organs and so you're
[652.72 - 655.52] working on
[653.76 - 657.76] basically making sure you're removing
[655.52 - 658.88] metals that are coming out of the skin
[657.76 - 661.68] from the bottom
[658.88 - 662.24] down so from the bottom down from your
[661.68 - 665.12] derma
[662.24 - 666.88] down and those those metals they leach
[665.12 - 668.32] over time and they drop down
[666.88 - 670.88] and that's what happens they go from
[668.32 - 672.24] your skin on down deeper to the derma
[670.88 - 673.12] until they finally get to all kinds of
[672.24 - 675.76] blood vessels
[673.12 - 677.76] and they leech like a leech field over
[675.76 - 680.88] time so when we get our ink
[677.76 - 682.32] it's leech fields of toxic waste
[680.88 - 683.84] because that's what ink is made out of i
[682.32 - 684.96] don't care when they say it's non-toxic
[683.84 - 688.24] that's not true
[684.96 - 688.96] that's not true because all ink is toxic
[688.24 - 691.44] so
[688.96 - 692.88] and that's okay and i don't want you to
[691.44 - 694.64] go run and try to get rid of your
[692.88 - 695.76] tattoos i don't want you to worry about
[694.64 - 697.60] that if you're somebody who loves
[695.76 - 698.72] tattoos and you've been really wanting
[697.60 - 700.40] to get another one
[698.72 - 702.08] you do what you want get another one
[700.40 - 704.64] whatever but
[702.08 - 705.28] be proactive and work on getting the
[704.64 - 708.64] metals
[705.28 - 710.24] out that's the key it's about you know
[708.64 - 711.68] it's about the information you know
[710.24 - 712.96] having that information it's so
[711.68 - 716.08] important
[712.96 - 718.32] and um so you don't want to do the re
[716.08 - 719.44] remove i i don't recommend removing them
[718.32 - 721.84] because trying to remove them through
[719.44 - 724.40] laser techniques and stuff because
[721.84 - 726.56] when you do that um they leach quicker
[724.40 - 729.36] they leach even more they leach in a
[726.56 - 732.40] large amount i'd rather have ink
[729.36 - 736.00] sitting on me let's just say
[732.40 - 738.80] okay or anyone i'd rather had have ink
[736.00 - 739.36] sit there and leech slowly year after
[738.80 - 740.88] year
[739.36 - 742.48] month after month for the rest of your
[740.88 - 745.20] life because you can
[742.48 - 747.60] when you're proactive and you're doing
[745.20 - 749.44] your heavy metal detox smoothie
[747.60 - 750.80] um and you're doing your spirulina
[749.44 - 752.96] you're doing your barley you're doing
[750.80 - 754.96] your dolls you're doing your cilantro
[752.96 - 756.40] you're gathering whatever's leeching
[754.96 - 758.24] you're gathering your gathering you're
[756.40 - 759.44] taking it out and you're sweeping it out
[758.24 - 761.52] right
[759.44 - 763.28] and that's what you want i don't
[761.52 - 764.40] recommend really removing any because
[763.28 - 766.56] when you do the removing
[764.40 - 767.76] of any kind of way they do it laser is
[766.56 - 771.04] the most uh
[767.76 - 773.04] common right now it's your your all of
[771.04 - 775.12] it's dumping into your system then you
[773.04 - 778.40] you can't get a control over that too
[775.12 - 779.84] easy so a lot of it can go to the brain
[778.40 - 781.44] let's work on this right here for a
[779.84 - 783.28] little bit so
[781.44 - 785.92] i'm going to pulse up actually i'm going
[783.28 - 786.80] to add some spices in here to pulse this
[785.92 - 790.32] up too
[786.80 - 793.76] so let me do that um making the rice
[790.32 - 795.20] and do a little paprika okay
[793.76 - 797.84] about a half teaspoon i'm gonna put a
[795.20 - 797.84] little in here
[799.36 - 803.60] okay put a paprika in that i'm making
[801.76 - 804.08] cauliflower rice you guys just so you
[803.60 - 808.88] know
[804.08 - 811.12] okay a little cayenne actually that's
[808.88 - 812.96] not actually not the cayenne putting the
[811.12 - 817.60] cumin
[812.96 - 817.60] em in here right got a little that
[818.80 - 823.76] and uh yeah and that i am putting a
[822.24 - 825.12] little cayenne in there a little touch
[823.76 - 826.84] of it
[825.12 - 828.88] okay but just a little bit quarter
[826.84 - 832.26] teaspoon
[828.88 - 833.44] so a quarter teaspoon in there
[832.26 - 836.00] [Music]
[833.44 - 837.68] and i'm putting uh two tablespoons of
[836.00 - 841.52] finely chopped
[837.68 - 844.40] uh cilantro so i'm going to chop up some
[841.52 - 844.40] cilantro here
[848.72 - 852.48] i was right it was cayenne going in
[850.88 - 857.84] there
[852.48 - 857.84] it's a little touch of it half
[858.60 - 861.76] [Music]
[864.16 - 868.32] so this is all one serving so
[869.52 - 873.68] look you can even use less of that if
[871.76 - 875.28] you if you're not a big fan of cumin if
[873.68 - 877.44] you're not a big fan of cayenne if
[875.28 - 880.00] you're not a big fan
[877.44 - 881.84] of paprika you can use a little bit a
[880.00 - 883.36] little bit i'm using about a tablespoon
[881.84 - 885.04] of cilantro right here
[883.36 - 886.56] it's about a tablespoon of cilantro in
[885.04 - 889.04] there
[886.56 - 889.04] there we go
[896.88 - 900.24] i'm gonna pulse this real quick pulsing
[899.20 - 903.28] into like a rice
[900.24 - 903.28] is what you guys are doing
[904.80 - 908.64] dan says what do we do about having ink
[907.28 - 909.84] what do you suggest about being
[908.64 - 911.44] proactive
[909.84 - 913.04] hi diane i'm glad you're on here i'm
[911.44 - 915.76] just gonna pulse up this
[913.04 - 915.76] cauliflower
[917.28 - 921.52] getting the metals out being proactive
[919.20 - 924.08] and removing toxic heavy metals
[921.52 - 925.04] and other toxins that that are in the
[924.08 - 926.40] ink that
[925.04 - 928.16] you've gotten a lot of people who have
[926.40 - 931.12] older ink they have ink
[928.16 - 932.08] that was even higher in toxic heavy
[931.12 - 934.88] metals
[932.08 - 936.72] but all ink whether it's vegan whether
[934.88 - 939.60] it's you know with cruelty free
[936.72 - 940.08] whether it says it's non-toxic is high
[939.60 - 942.00] in toxic
[940.08 - 944.40] heavy metals no matter what because they
[942.00 - 946.32] have to that's how it's seen through
[944.40 - 947.28] your skin i'm just giving you the 4-1-1
[946.32 - 949.12] on that now i know
[947.28 - 950.48] a tattoo artist might be upset when they
[949.12 - 951.84] hear that and they may like he's not
[950.48 - 954.72] right that's not true
[951.84 - 955.12] my supplier says this or i got this but
[954.72 - 956.88] what
[955.12 - 958.56] they don't realize remember they're the
[956.88 - 961.44] artist it doesn't mean they're an
[958.56 - 962.16] expert at the chemical composition of
[961.44 - 965.12] where
[962.16 - 966.96] and how these inks are made and that's
[965.12 - 970.08] really important to know you know
[966.96 - 971.12] regardless of what they're told in in in
[970.08 - 974.48] order
[971.12 - 977.44] for your ink to pop through your skin
[974.48 - 977.84] it there has to be metal in the ink
[977.44 - 981.20] that's
[977.84 - 982.00] what reflects off the light it's the
[981.20 - 984.88] metals in the
[982.00 - 986.72] ink that will send out that red that
[984.88 - 987.68] will send out that yellow that will send
[986.72 - 990.16] out the orange
[987.68 - 991.84] that will send out the purple the blue
[990.16 - 994.72] that will send out the black
[991.84 - 996.64] it that's the reflection that it needs
[994.72 - 998.24] it's about that so talking about being
[996.64 - 1000.48] proactive here
[998.24 - 1002.48] so i made the rice proactive is actually
[1000.48 - 1003.84] doing the heavy metal detox smoothie
[1002.48 - 1005.52] that's what i have friends i have
[1003.84 - 1006.88] friends that have ink got lots of
[1005.52 - 1008.88] friends that are loaded with ink
[1006.88 - 1010.00] okay they got them everywhere they got
[1008.88 - 1012.00] an ink on their neck
[1010.00 - 1013.36] they got ink on their legs they got ink
[1012.00 - 1014.88] everywhere and
[1013.36 - 1016.64] um and they're doing the heavy metal
[1014.88 - 1018.00] detox smoothie so the medical medium
[1016.64 - 1019.68] heavy metal detox smoothie so they're
[1018.00 - 1022.16] being proactive in that way
[1019.68 - 1022.80] they're doing uh vimergy spirulina the
[1022.16 - 1025.04] memory
[1022.80 - 1027.12] barley grass so they're using the right
[1025.04 - 1028.96] stuff i mean you could use whatever
[1027.12 - 1030.96] you want to find a spirulina you like go
[1028.96 - 1032.32] use it you want to find a barley grass
[1030.96 - 1033.76] juice powder you like go use it that's
[1032.32 - 1035.04] what i recommend my friends and family
[1033.76 - 1037.36] that's what i use
[1035.04 - 1038.56] um i don't i mean personally i don't
[1037.36 - 1040.08] have a lot of faith in the other
[1038.56 - 1041.92] products out there when it comes down to
[1040.08 - 1044.88] those i'm not sponsored by
[1041.92 - 1046.88] by bimergy um but anyway terry says
[1044.88 - 1050.56] misinformation
[1046.88 - 1050.56] um yeah i mean
[1051.28 - 1056.08] it's not misinformation and i love how
[1054.56 - 1058.40] you use my word
[1056.08 - 1059.84] because that's that's funny because all
[1058.40 - 1060.88] these years that's what i've always used
[1059.84 - 1062.72] is misinformation
[1060.88 - 1064.16] unless that's for someone else that
[1062.72 - 1066.32] might have been for someone else
[1064.16 - 1068.56] um but anyway it's interesting though as
[1066.32 - 1070.40] far as uh stuff goes
[1068.56 - 1071.84] if it was for someone else thanks
[1070.40 - 1074.96] exactly but you know
[1071.84 - 1075.68] but yeah it the metals have to be in the
[1074.96 - 1078.48] ink
[1075.68 - 1079.44] in order to reflect the light that's how
[1078.48 - 1082.32] you get your
[1079.44 - 1083.68] greatest maximum color out of there and
[1082.32 - 1086.00] that's how it works
[1083.68 - 1087.36] um so let's just keep on making this
[1086.00 - 1088.96] here's the rice i'm gonna put the rice
[1087.36 - 1095.84] in this bowl i have this bowl right here
[1088.96 - 1095.84] it's a blue bowl
[1097.92 - 1105.76] let's get a spoon now
[1101.28 - 1105.76] this isn't the only ingredient okay
[1106.16 - 1110.00] this is just one of them i'm going to
[1108.08 - 1111.68] lay some lettuce down here first inside
[1110.00 - 1113.84] this bowl i think i'm going to do that
[1111.68 - 1115.44] first a little lettuce at the bottom of
[1113.84 - 1117.76] here so i'm going to chop up a little
[1115.44 - 1121.04] lettuce this is butter leaf right here
[1117.76 - 1121.04] this is butter leaf lettuce
[1121.60 - 1125.60] so the medical medium heavy metal detox
[1123.52 - 1127.04] smoothie is about being proactive
[1125.60 - 1129.52] lots of people are using it around the
[1127.04 - 1131.92] world it's saving lives
[1129.52 - 1134.00] what i love about the the medical medium
[1131.92 - 1135.28] heavy metal detox movie it's already
[1134.00 - 1138.16] helped people
[1135.28 - 1139.28] with depression anxiety bipolar
[1138.16 - 1142.24] schizophrenia
[1139.28 - 1143.36] alzheimer's dementia depersonalization
[1142.24 - 1147.04] adhd
[1143.36 - 1152.16] autism and ticks spasms
[1147.04 - 1155.36] tourette's ocd did i say that one
[1152.16 - 1157.04] and um it's already helped so many
[1155.36 - 1157.68] people heal around the world i'm putting
[1157.04 - 1160.96] a little
[1157.68 - 1160.96] lettuce in the bottom of this bowl
[1163.20 - 1166.24] so um
[1166.48 - 1170.08] but i like that the the medical medium
[1168.32 - 1172.96] heavy metal detox smoothie for that
[1170.08 - 1174.40] i like it for chronic illness too you're
[1172.96 - 1176.16] dealing with lyme disease you're dealing
[1174.40 - 1179.76] with cfs you're dealing with ra
[1176.16 - 1181.92] hashimoto's thyroiditis eczema psoriasis
[1179.76 - 1183.28] whatever it is it's great for that too
[1181.92 - 1185.12] because when people are sick with
[1183.28 - 1186.64] viruses like epstein-barr virus and
[1185.12 - 1189.44] shingles virus and all that
[1186.64 - 1191.36] viruses feed off of toxic heavy metals
[1189.44 - 1192.88] so that's that's a reason why to do it
[1191.36 - 1194.24] too all on its own

[1194.24 - 1196.88] bowl now i'm going to put some rice down

[1354.48 - 1357.52] scratching the surface
[1356.00 - 1361.84] so i got the cauliflower rice right
[1357.52 - 1361.84] there so i'm excited
[1362.96 - 1366.32] let's start making the salsa how about
[1365.12 - 1367.92] if we do that we're going to make
[1366.32 - 1370.96] guacamole
[1367.92 - 1372.64] in a little bit a little bit of that too
[1370.96 - 1374.80] let's start making the salsa let's do
[1372.64 - 1377.04] that so let's get the tomatoes going
[1374.80 - 1379.04] i got these vine ripe tomatoes you see
[1377.04 - 1381.52] this if you guys are afraid of tomatoes
[1379.04 - 1383.20] i feel kind of bad because
[1381.52 - 1384.88] there's no reason to be afraid of them
[1383.20 - 1386.72] they're so good for you it's there's
[1384.88 - 1388.96] misinformation out there on tomatoes
[1386.72 - 1390.48] always has been
[1388.96 - 1392.64] hanging there we're about to talk about
[1390.48 - 1393.20] copper in a minute too but i wanted to
[1392.64 - 1396.56] cover the
[1393.20 - 1398.48] ink as much as i could right now
[1396.56 - 1401.12] i know a lot of you guys have ink i
[1398.48 - 1402.56] totally get it
[1401.12 - 1404.64] but we're gonna go into the copper
[1402.56 - 1405.60] that's next let me just dice up some
[1404.64 - 1409.04] tomatoes
[1405.60 - 1410.40] so there's a trend happening right now
[1409.04 - 1413.28] and
[1410.40 - 1414.72] it's a trend of copper's good for you
[1413.28 - 1418.56] dear lord
[1414.72 - 1421.44] that's a nightmare okay it's far from
[1418.56 - 1424.48] good for you copper thermoses
[1421.44 - 1428.24] copper water
[1424.48 - 1432.16] storage units copper
[1428.24 - 1435.20] anything like that copper jewelry
[1432.16 - 1438.64] copper wear the reason why
[1435.20 - 1442.56] copper wear people swear by it sometimes
[1438.64 - 1444.72] is because it's it's um it's support
[1442.56 - 1445.60] is what it is so it's actual supports
[1444.72 - 1448.48] compression
[1445.60 - 1450.24] compression support so it can be without
[1448.48 - 1451.12] the copper and someone's going to swear
[1450.24 - 1452.88] by it okay
[1451.12 - 1454.72] so it doesn't it doesn't matter any kind
[1452.88 - 1457.44] of compression
[1454.72 - 1458.16] sleeves compression knee braces
[1457.44 - 1460.80] compression
[1458.16 - 1461.68] socks compression elbow braces
[1460.80 - 1464.80] compression
[1461.68 - 1466.96] wrist bands rich wrist braces
[1464.80 - 1468.96] any kind of compression therapy is
[1466.96 - 1471.20] helpful and people swear by it
[1468.96 - 1473.36] they didn't have to stick copper in it
[1471.20 - 1474.96] copper's toxic so then people get copper
[1473.36 - 1478.24] leaching through their skin
[1474.96 - 1478.80] copper is not anti-inflammatory it never
[1478.24 - 1480.60] was
[1478.80 - 1482.16] and anybody who thinks copper's
[1480.60 - 1483.92] anti-inflammatory
[1482.16 - 1485.68] it's coming from a place any kind of
[1483.92 - 1487.28] professional any kind of authority or
[1485.68 - 1489.60] health authority that thinks
[1487.28 - 1491.04] copper's anti-inflammatory they don't
[1489.60 - 1492.64] know what's causing inflammation to
[1491.04 - 1494.16] begin with so you got to remember that
[1492.64 - 1495.68] so it's coming from sources that don't
[1494.16 - 1497.28] know why anybody's sick
[1495.68 - 1499.36] before i released the truth about
[1497.28 - 1500.96] epstein-barr no one even knew
[1499.36 - 1503.20] that there was even a possibility that
[1500.96 - 1504.48] viruses caused any kind of inflammation
[1503.20 - 1507.28] so the medical media books have brought
[1504.48 - 1511.04] that out there okay and
[1507.28 - 1512.72] copper is toxic copper's in pesticides
[1511.04 - 1515.52] it's one of the leading reasons why
[1512.72 - 1517.76] pesticides are so bad and we get sick
[1515.52 - 1518.96] it's because of copper copper's in
[1517.76 - 1522.24] fungicides
[1518.96 - 1522.88] pesticides fire retardant it's it's
[1522.24 - 1526.00] actually
[1522.88 - 1527.04] it's actually a toxin it's dangerous to
[1526.00 - 1530.32] us
[1527.04 - 1531.76] copper pennies are bad for us to be in
[1530.32 - 1535.60] our hands and you play around
[1531.76 - 1537.92] if you ever counted a jar of old pennies
[1535.60 - 1539.52] and you counted them by hand and wrapped
[1537.92 - 1541.52] them in you know the little
[1539.52 - 1542.56] the little you know coin sleeves and you
[1541.52 - 1545.12] put them in there right
[1542.56 - 1546.24] your hands will smell like straight
[1545.12 - 1548.56] metal like straight
[1546.24 - 1550.64] copper and it absorbs into your system
[1548.56 - 1552.64] anybody who's counted pennies
[1550.64 - 1553.84] you know and they put the 50 pennies in
[1552.64 - 1555.68] the sleeve and
[1553.84 - 1556.96] you know and you make and you make do a
[1555.68 - 1558.16] bunch of them because you have a jar of
[1556.96 - 1560.32] pennies kicking by
[1558.16 - 1561.84] you get copper poisoning from that it's
[1560.32 - 1563.52] critical to get that copper out of your
[1561.84 - 1565.04] body because it leads to eczema and
[1563.52 - 1567.84] psoriasis dermatitis
[1565.04 - 1570.16] rosacea it leads to so many problems it
[1567.84 - 1573.28] just leads to skin skin conditions
[1570.16 - 1577.20] uh galore it just leads to them so
[1573.28 - 1579.52] because copper is responsible for
[1577.20 - 1580.32] excellent psoriasis a huge part of it so
[1579.52 - 1582.24] here we go
[1580.32 - 1584.64] let's just do copper thermoses let's
[1582.24 - 1588.16] just do copper mugs let's just do copper
[1584.64 - 1591.52] everything and um and
[1588.16 - 1595.20] it's really a toxic toxic heavy metal
[1591.52 - 1596.08] copper pipes the reason why family lines
[1595.20 - 1598.24] are sick
[1596.08 - 1599.28] and riddled with skin conditions like
[1598.24 - 1601.84] eczema psoriasis
[1599.28 - 1603.60] and other autoimmune conditions is from
[1601.84 - 1606.72] copper pipes
[1603.60 - 1607.92] and so now we got this trend that
[1606.72 - 1609.60] believes
[1607.92 - 1611.44] when they don't even know why anybody's
[1609.60 - 1613.12] sick because science research doesn't
[1611.44 - 1614.96] know anybody why anybody's sick so why
[1613.12 - 1615.84] would the copper trend people know why
[1614.96 - 1618.72] anybody is sick
[1615.84 - 1619.04] um so so the copper trend people are
[1618.72 - 1620.96] like
[1619.04 - 1623.52] making products out there and people got
[1620.96 - 1626.00] their water sitting in that
[1623.52 - 1626.96] dear lord i mean it's really bad like
[1626.00 - 1628.80] really bad
[1626.96 - 1630.24] it's just gonna lead to sickness it's
[1628.80 - 1631.60] gonna poison their livers it's gonna
[1630.24 - 1634.08] poison their brain
[1631.60 - 1635.92] but it really is you keep that water
[1634.08 - 1638.64] inside that copper unit
[1635.92 - 1639.36] and your water is now contaminated
[1638.64 - 1642.48] that's
[1639.36 - 1644.24] just yeah that's just a few things i can
[1642.48 - 1646.40] say about it so i'll talk about copper a
[1644.24 - 1647.04] little bit more on how trace copper's
[1646.40 - 1649.44] different
[1647.04 - 1651.04] in the soil and even that is not
[1649.44 - 1654.48] something we want lots of
[1651.04 - 1658.00] just so you know copper
[1654.48 - 1661.12] is not something that we are
[1658.00 - 1664.88] lacking of we have too much
[1661.12 - 1668.08] copper all of us there's copper
[1664.88 - 1671.36] in the foods we eat too much
[1668.08 - 1673.92] there's too much copper in avocado
[1671.36 - 1675.76] that's a high copper food too much
[1673.92 - 1678.40] copper and avocado
[1675.76 - 1681.60] all right because avocado trees tend to
[1678.40 - 1683.44] absorb copper more than others
[1681.60 - 1685.52] alex says the copper trend comes from
[1683.44 - 1687.20] ayurveda for thousands of years
[1685.52 - 1688.64] there might be more to it than just the
[1687.20 - 1690.00] trend well
[1688.64 - 1692.40] here's how it works okay i know what
[1690.00 - 1695.12] you're saying because okay airbag so
[1692.40 - 1695.76] here's how it works with water there
[1695.12 - 1698.16] wasn't
[1695.76 - 1699.60] fresh water supplies okay there weren't
[1698.16 - 1702.48] fresh water supplies
[1699.60 - 1704.32] and a high amount of copper can destroy
[1702.48 - 1705.36] an amoeba so in a meat because it's
[1704.32 - 1710.24] toxic
[1705.36 - 1713.04] so amoeba okay certain water parasites
[1710.24 - 1714.40] actually get destroyed from copper
[1713.04 - 1717.52] poisoning
[1714.40 - 1719.20] you see how it works alex so the the
[1717.52 - 1720.08] whole thing it went back years ago they
[1719.20 - 1722.32] didn't have running
[1720.08 - 1724.08] fresh water running water an ayurvedic
[1722.32 - 1726.48] in ayurvedic medicine they know this
[1724.08 - 1728.88] that going back thousands of years okay
[1726.48 - 1730.40] they knew that it was hard to get fresh
[1728.88 - 1732.24] water back then you didn't have
[1730.40 - 1734.24] fresh water pipes you didn't have spring
[1732.24 - 1736.00] water coming out of places it was rare
[1734.24 - 1738.56] you can find something like this
[1736.00 - 1739.20] villages would be just out of water so
[1738.56 - 1741.36] whatever
[1739.20 - 1742.64] rain water came down they would keep it
[1741.36 - 1746.00] in copper
[1742.64 - 1748.96] barrels because the copper poisoning
[1746.00 - 1750.56] would kill off not everything you still
[1748.96 - 1752.72] can get the worst dysentery
[1750.56 - 1754.72] you can still get sick but it would kill
[1752.72 - 1757.36] off certain amoeba
[1754.72 - 1759.20] certain parasitic um you know
[1757.36 - 1761.52] microorganisms that's what it would do
[1759.20 - 1762.96] okay and that's what it was used for it
[1761.52 - 1766.40] was used for a
[1762.96 - 1770.40] partly for a war water sanitation
[1766.40 - 1773.76] control okay because you can poison
[1770.40 - 1777.20] a microorganism with copper
[1773.76 - 1780.08] see how it works that's all it was and
[1777.20 - 1781.92] kind of kind of think about stuff okay
[1780.08 - 1783.84] does those thousands of years of
[1781.92 - 1785.20] smartness that you're talking about
[1783.84 - 1787.44] does that fix all the millions of people
[1785.20 - 1788.80] with chronic illness um
[1787.44 - 1790.56] i'm not gonna pick on different
[1788.80 - 1793.52] countries and different places
[1790.56 - 1794.56] but disease is rampant rampant and
[1793.52 - 1798.24] america
[1794.56 - 1800.88] disease is rampant here it's rampant
[1798.24 - 1804.00] everywhere okay just in the u.s alone
[1800.88 - 1805.68] 250 275 million americans in the u.s
[1804.00 - 1806.24] alone have symptoms they can't get rid
[1805.68 - 1808.48] of
[1806.24 - 1810.24] symptoms they can't get rid of millions
[1808.48 - 1813.36] of children are sick okay
[1810.24 - 1815.36] and i get it you want to find some kind
[1813.36 - 1817.12] of mysterious thing that's thousands of
[1815.36 - 1820.56] years old that might have an
[1817.12 - 1822.40] answer but when babies are riddled with
[1820.56 - 1823.60] eczema psoriasis and they got ticks and
[1822.40 - 1827.12] spasms
[1823.60 - 1829.76] and severe tourettes and severe ocd and
[1827.12 - 1830.48] autism and everything else it just so
[1829.76 - 1833.52] you know
[1830.48 - 1835.60] copper makes those conditions worse so
[1833.52 - 1836.64] does ayurvedic medicine know that no
[1835.60 - 1838.88] they don't
[1836.64 - 1841.36] so i get i get it though you want to
[1838.88 - 1842.08] kind of you want that nostalgic like
[1841.36 - 1844.08] whoa
[1842.08 - 1846.00] say your vatic there must be something
[1844.08 - 1847.76] to it going all the way back
[1846.00 - 1849.76] they must know so much they must know
[1847.76 - 1852.32] everything and i understand that
[1849.76 - 1854.00] i totally understand that survival
[1852.32 - 1857.20] doesn't equal healthy
[1854.00 - 1857.84] a survival technique to keep your water
[1857.20 - 1860.48] from getting
[1857.84 - 1861.12] too riddled with a certain microorganism
[1860.48 - 1863.84] by using
[1861.12 - 1865.92] copper to control it doesn't mean it's
[1863.84 - 1866.48] necessarily healthy and going to give
[1865.92 - 1869.68] you
[1866.48 - 1871.68] good standing health but see that's more
[1869.68 - 1872.16] advanced information than thousands of
[1871.68 - 1875.60] years
[1872.16 - 1878.72] of of um you know antiquated information
[1875.60 - 1880.88] you have to think about something a
[1878.72 - 1882.88] thousand years ago 2000 years ago they
[1880.88 - 1883.44] thought you can fix your brain by eating
[1882.88 - 1886.56] brain
[1883.44 - 1889.04] that was 2 000 years ago it's antiquated
[1886.56 - 1891.52] it doesn't work but am i supposed to
[1889.04 - 1893.20] like respect it to the point where
[1891.52 - 1895.20] i'm supposed to be like bowed down to
[1893.20 - 1896.80] whoa i better bow down to that because a
[1895.20 - 1898.88] thousand years ago
[1896.80 - 1901.04] they said they said that if you ate
[1898.88 - 1902.88] brain you fix your brain i better stitch
[1901.04 - 1904.88] a thousand years old alex i better
[1902.88 - 1906.96] i better bow down to that aerobatic
[1904.88 - 1909.28] medicine well you copper
[1906.96 - 1911.28] you can use copper and water to control
[1909.28 - 1912.56] bad microorganisms so we better get lots
[1911.28 - 1913.92] of copper in our water
[1912.56 - 1915.44] because that must be the reason why
[1913.92 - 1916.24] we're sick we'll just we'll just drink
[1915.44 - 1919.20] the copper
[1916.24 - 1920.48] i better bow down to that and here's
[1919.20 - 1923.60] another thing too
[1920.48 - 1925.20] um mercury elixirs right for thousands
[1923.60 - 1927.84] of years
[1925.20 - 1929.04] mercury elixirs were big they were big
[1927.84 - 1931.12] all around the planet
[1929.04 - 1932.88] you drink mercury tonics i better bow
[1931.12 - 1934.96] down to it they were right
[1932.88 - 1936.08] two thousand three thousand years ago
[1934.96 - 1938.80] okay and
[1936.08 - 1939.84] in the east okay it was mercury elixirs
[1938.80 - 1942.88] mercury elixirs
[1939.84 - 1943.52] emperors would take mercury elixirs and
[1942.88 - 1946.00] you know
[1943.52 - 1947.60] uh presidents would take mercury elixirs
[1946.00 - 1949.84] just in the 1800s
[1947.60 - 1951.60] are we supposed to bow down to the
[1949.84 - 1952.88] mercury elixirs because it's two
[1951.60 - 1954.08] thousand three thousand four thousand
[1952.88 - 1956.96] years old
[1954.08 - 1957.76] i'm curious is does that make sense yeah
[1956.96 - 1959.60] i get it
[1957.76 - 1961.28] you know there's some things that travel
[1959.60 - 1963.92] a long way like massage
[1961.28 - 1964.96] like acupressure and they travel
[1963.92 - 1967.20] thousands of years
[1964.96 - 1968.72] and those are great things but you can't
[1967.20 - 1970.32] just all of a sudden assume
[1968.72 - 1971.76] that every single thing that comes from
[1970.32 - 1972.88] two thousand three thousand years ago is
[1971.76 - 1975.52] a great idea
[1972.88 - 1977.04] because it's not and fermented foods was
[1975.52 - 1979.04] a survival technique
[1977.04 - 1980.80] not right there because fermented foods
[1979.04 - 1982.88] comes from two thousand three thousand
[1980.80 - 1985.36] four thousand years ago that it must be
[1982.88 - 1986.24] the panacea to heal us it must actually
[1985.36 - 1987.76] be the cure
[1986.24 - 1990.40] the cure but you gotta understand
[1987.76 - 1992.56] fermented foods are just decomposing
[1990.40 - 1993.68] it's it the microorganisms in fermented
[1992.56 - 1995.92] foods are the
[1993.68 - 1998.08] microorganisms of death that are feeding
[1995.92 - 2000.32] off of something that's decomposing
[1998.08 - 2002.48] right but that's not the microorganisms
[2000.32 - 2004.24] that give you life inside of you
[2002.48 - 2006.24] that those microorganisms are only on
[2004.24 - 2007.68] living foods when you have cilantro in
[2006.24 - 2009.44] your garden
[2007.68 - 2011.92] the microorganism that's sitting on the
[2009.44 - 2013.44] cilantro why it's sitting there floating
[2011.92 - 2014.64] around in the sun and the wind there's a
[2013.44 - 2016.48] microorganism in that
[2014.64 - 2018.56] that's the one that gives you life so
[2016.48 - 2020.08] when you eat that that cilantro that
[2018.56 - 2022.00] came out of your garden
[2020.08 - 2023.84] that elevated biotic is what gives you
[2022.00 - 2026.40] life not
[2023.84 - 2028.56] the bacteria that's on something that's
[2026.40 - 2030.16] decaying and dying when an animal dies
[2028.56 - 2031.36] in the woods it gets engulfed by
[2030.16 - 2033.36] bacteria
[2031.36 - 2034.80] microorganisms that go to it because
[2033.36 - 2038.40] it's dead
[2034.80 - 2038.72] when we when we pass on and we start to
[2038.40 - 2041.28] go
[2038.72 - 2044.40] stale fast after passing on
[2041.28 - 2047.52] microorganisms start to devour our body
[2044.40 - 2049.92] that's not the microorganism that we get
[2047.52 - 2050.56] life from so when the reason why they
[2049.92 - 2052.72] did this
[2050.56 - 2053.92] is they fermented vegetables was a
[2052.72 - 2055.76] survival technique
[2053.92 - 2057.52] technique because they had no fresh food
[2055.76 - 2058.96] delivered there weren't stores
[2057.52 - 2060.80] there weren't grocery stores there
[2058.96 - 2061.44] wasn't fresh food grown around the
[2060.80 - 2063.84] planet
[2061.44 - 2066.08] that can be delivered you know through
[2063.84 - 2067.76] plane travel and truck travel
[2066.08 - 2069.12] right so what happened was they were in
[2067.76 - 2071.60] these little villages
[2069.12 - 2073.04] thousands of years ago in the hills and
[2071.60 - 2074.48] when your garden ran out
[2073.04 - 2076.72] you were you were you were in big
[2074.48 - 2079.84] trouble you had your chicken eggs
[2076.72 - 2081.44] you had your you had your goat's milk
[2079.84 - 2082.80] and you had whatever vegetables that
[2081.44 - 2083.20] were left over and you know what you had
[2082.80 - 2084.56] to do
[2083.20 - 2087.44] you had to take those vegetables and you
[2084.56 - 2089.68] had to throw them in a vat a big old vat
[2087.44 - 2091.52] and throw a lid on it and hope that god
[2089.68 - 2092.24] they just did their natural decaying
[2091.52 - 2095.44] process
[2092.24 - 2098.80] fermented and broke down and
[2095.44 - 2100.88] because you needed to eat that slob
[2098.80 - 2103.28] all winter long in order to keep you
[2100.88 - 2105.68] alive see how it works this is important
[2103.28 - 2107.28] information this is advanced information
[2105.68 - 2109.20] and i teach this to doctors i've been
[2107.28 - 2112.80] teaching this stuff for years okay
[2109.20 - 2113.36] so that fermented foods was a survival
[2112.80 - 2116.88] tactic
[2113.36 - 2118.56] to try to preserve the food long enough
[2116.88 - 2119.92] to get you to the spring
[2118.56 - 2121.04] because you would starve to death
[2119.92 - 2122.56] because you had no freezers and
[2121.04 - 2125.36] refrigerators
[2122.56 - 2125.84] and you had no fresh food coming in
[2125.36 - 2128.96] that's
[2125.84 - 2132.00] what happened but we take these old
[2128.96 - 2135.68] things a long time ago and we think
[2132.00 - 2137.92] they must be so good for us and but yet
[2135.68 - 2139.76] there's better things for us fermented
[2137.92 - 2141.12] foods not better than this butter leaf
[2139.76 - 2142.64] lettuce that's fresh and alive and
[2141.12 - 2144.96] filled with enzymes right now
[2142.64 - 2146.56] okay and it's certainly not better than
[2144.96 - 2147.68] butter leaf lettuce that you grew out of
[2146.56 - 2149.60] your garden this year that has
[2147.68 - 2150.80] microorganisms all over it the kind that
[2149.60 - 2154.08] gives us life
[2150.80 - 2156.88] and fermented food can't beat
[2154.08 - 2158.24] lime right here a lime with the vitamin
[2156.88 - 2160.48] c and the calcium in it
[2158.24 - 2161.44] and it can't be the power of what the
[2160.48 - 2164.40] sun can do and
[2161.44 - 2165.12] and what goes in this orange here and so
[2164.40 - 2167.60] but
[2165.12 - 2168.88] i get it we think thousands of years ago
[2167.60 - 2172.16] ayurvedic medicine
[2168.88 - 2174.32] ayurvedic ayurvedic information um
[2172.16 - 2175.20] copper in the water it must mean it's
[2174.32 - 2176.48] good for us
[2175.20 - 2178.40] that's funny because i talked to the
[2176.48 - 2179.44] best ayurvedic doctors that contact me
[2178.40 - 2182.40] around the planet
[2179.44 - 2183.44] and they don't know why anybody's sick
[2182.40 - 2185.60] they don't
[2183.44 - 2187.36] they have they have their their your
[2185.60 - 2189.76] their guesses about maybe it's
[2187.36 - 2191.76] too much dampness in the body and maybe
[2189.76 - 2193.28] it's the liver acting up somehow or
[2191.76 - 2196.08] maybe it's something
[2193.28 - 2197.28] but they don't know why you have eczema
[2196.08 - 2199.28] raging
[2197.28 - 2201.92] air vedic doctors don't know why
[2199.28 - 2204.88] someone's sick with severe
[2201.92 - 2205.92] chronic fatigue syndrome me but i
[2204.88 - 2208.16] respect them
[2205.92 - 2209.68] greatly i have great respect for the
[2208.16 - 2211.76] best doctors on the planet functional
[2209.68 - 2214.48] medicine doctors ayurvedic doctors
[2211.76 - 2215.68] chinese medicine doctors conventional
[2214.48 - 2217.68] medical doctors
[2215.68 - 2219.36] on the plan great respect for all of
[2217.68 - 2221.20] them i have respect for all of them
[2219.36 - 2222.64] because they're helping people and they
[2221.20 - 2223.92] do help and they do have a lot of
[2222.64 - 2225.28] knowledge but what i'm trying to tell
[2223.92 - 2226.64] you is
[2225.28 - 2228.16] is they don't have answers to why
[2226.64 - 2229.60] anybody's chronically ill they don't
[2228.16 - 2231.36] science research believes it's the body
[2229.60 - 2234.08] destroying itself or it's genes
[2231.36 - 2235.52] that's it so i guess we could package it
[2234.08 - 2238.08] up be like just because
[2235.52 - 2239.44] you know copper holding water back
[2238.08 - 2241.04] thousands of years ago must be the
[2239.44 - 2243.76] fantasy of answers
[2241.04 - 2245.20] just so you know you get you put your
[2243.76 - 2246.48] water in copper
[2245.20 - 2247.84] and you're going to be sicker than ever
[2246.48 - 2250.56] before down the road you're going to get
[2247.84 - 2252.72] so much copper in your system
[2250.56 - 2254.08] in your organs and you're telling me
[2252.72 - 2256.72] everybody just stayed alive and all
[2254.08 - 2258.32] happy no one was ever sick
[2256.72 - 2259.76] you don't know how that stuff was making
[2258.32 - 2260.72] people sicker and sicker and sicker and
[2259.76 - 2262.72] sicker and sicker
[2260.72 - 2264.72] no one's watching that no one's watching
[2262.72 - 2266.48] how how much water did you drink out of
[2264.72 - 2267.84] that copper vat a thousand years ago
[2266.48 - 2269.68] who knows how the person died of a
[2267.84 - 2271.84] horrible death years later
[2269.68 - 2273.92] is anybody studying that no one's
[2271.84 - 2275.68] studying any of that you can't study it
[2273.92 - 2278.00] it's all guesswork it's all guessing
[2275.68 - 2280.32] games so let's make a trend let's make a
[2278.00 - 2282.40] new trend off of some old outdated
[2280.32 - 2285.04] thing that wasn't great so let's make
[2282.40 - 2286.48] copper thermoses so we can poison women
[2285.04 - 2288.00] because that's going to be real good for
[2286.48 - 2289.60] their babies when their babies get all
[2288.00 - 2290.96] that copper in their brain
[2289.60 - 2292.64] can you think about pregnant what about
[2290.96 - 2293.84] pregnant women doing all the copper
[2292.64 - 2295.44] stuff
[2293.84 - 2297.44] if you're going to wear jewelry i would
[2295.44 - 2298.00] wear gold plated because it's protect
[2297.44 - 2300.64] it's going
[2298.00 - 2301.60] over the copper or i would wear gold i
[2300.64 - 2303.84] don't wear jewelry
[2301.60 - 2305.60] but if you're into jewelry i would wear
[2303.84 - 2307.36] gold that's what i would do
[2305.60 - 2309.04] there's always a little copper in gold
[2307.36 - 2310.80] unless it's 24 karat there's always
[2309.04 - 2312.24] alloyed in there but the point is it's
[2310.80 - 2313.60] very much less
[2312.24 - 2315.52] but i wouldn't wear straight copper
[2313.60 - 2317.76] jewelry i wouldn't wear that
[2315.52 - 2319.36] i wouldn't wear copper copper items i
[2317.76 - 2321.12] wouldn't wear copper clothing
[2319.36 - 2322.96] i wouldn't do copper and water god
[2321.12 - 2324.40] forbid if i was a pregnant woman or
[2322.96 - 2326.08] wanting to have a baby
[2324.40 - 2328.00] i certainly wouldn't do any of that
[2326.08 - 2329.68] copper stuff without there's no doubt
[2328.00 - 2332.40] about that unless
[2329.68 - 2334.48] the baby's just gonna get copper uh
[2332.40 - 2337.20] copper in the baby system
[2334.48 - 2338.72] um all the stuff's important so but alex
[2337.20 - 2340.00] i get it and i really appreciate you and
[2338.72 - 2342.96] i appreciate you talking about that
[2340.00 - 2344.08] i actually um wanted to talk about that
[2342.96 - 2345.92] too
[2344.08 - 2347.60] okay plastic pvc i want to talk about
[2345.92 - 2349.52] that that's important too
[2347.60 - 2352.32] is it healthier than copper pipes oh big
[2349.52 - 2355.84] time that's not the leaching plastic
[2352.32 - 2359.68] pcv the hard pcv they use in plumbing
[2355.84 - 2362.88] okay the hard stuff the pvc they use
[2359.68 - 2363.68] in in plumbing is not the leaching
[2362.88 - 2365.60] plastic
[2363.68 - 2367.28] and i would rather in a million years
[2365.60 - 2369.04] have leaching plastic
[2367.28 - 2372.00] any day because plastic comes out of the
[2369.04 - 2373.76] body easy just like lowering your fats
[2372.00 - 2375.44] you know lowering your fats not on too
[2373.76 - 2376.16] much milk cheese butter bringing all
[2375.44 - 2377.68] that down
[2376.16 - 2379.36] making you sure you do the heavy metal
[2377.68 - 2380.80] detox smoothie because spirulina does
[2379.36 - 2382.88] remove plastic
[2380.80 - 2385.36] there's an anti-plastic tee in this book
[2382.88 - 2387.84] right here so um in the new edition but
[2385.36 - 2391.92] the point is plastic comes out easy
[2387.84 - 2394.56] and hardened pvc piping
[2391.92 - 2395.28] doesn't leach up anything practically
[2394.56 - 2396.88] practically
[2395.28 - 2399.04] nothing it's it's a whole different
[2396.88 - 2401.44] story than other types of plastic right
[2399.04 - 2402.48] that's one thing the other thing is
[2401.44 - 2405.68] copper pipes
[2402.48 - 2407.04] that's poisoned families for years the
[2405.68 - 2409.28] amount of damage
[2407.04 - 2410.24] copper pipes have done to families and
[2409.28 - 2413.60] their health
[2410.24 - 2416.48] is catastrophic it causes green
[2413.60 - 2418.16] green that green corrosion that goes in
[2416.48 - 2420.32] all the sinks in the toilets if you
[2418.16 - 2422.08] don't have your water softened
[2420.32 - 2422.96] and even if you have your water softened
[2422.08 - 2424.00] you're still going to get copper
[2422.96 - 2425.28] leaching now you may not
[2424.00 - 2427.04] have any control over that if you got
[2425.28 - 2428.72] copper pipes but yes you do
[2427.04 - 2430.32] okay you do have control over that first
[2428.72 - 2431.84] of all make sure your water is filtered
[2430.32 - 2433.12] don't drink it out of the tap that's one
[2431.84 - 2434.64] thing you can control
[2433.12 - 2436.00] the second thing you can control is
[2434.64 - 2437.04] making sure you're doing a heavy metal
[2436.00 - 2438.40] detox smoothie
[2437.04 - 2440.48] so you're proactive in getting the
[2438.40 - 2442.48] copper out faster than it comes in
[2440.48 - 2444.00] so if you're taking your shower and you
[2442.48 - 2445.60] think there could be some copper stuff
[2444.00 - 2447.04] going on in the water
[2445.60 - 2448.24] you can do that check with your doctor
[2447.04 - 2449.36] and see what you're do what's right with
[2448.24 - 2450.96] your doctor you know if you want to do
[2449.36 - 2452.00] the heavy metal detox smoothie some day
[2450.96 - 2453.84] in your life if you want to learn
[2452.00 - 2455.12] about it if you want to find the recipe
[2453.84 - 2457.36] in the book or on the blog
[2455.12 - 2458.64] ask your doctor if it's right for you
[2457.36 - 2461.04] and see how they feel okay if your
[2458.64 - 2464.16] doctor says don't do it don't do it
[2461.04 - 2465.20] but the point is is that you can be
[2464.16 - 2467.12] proactive
[2465.20 - 2468.32] but yes what they're trying to tell you
[2467.12 - 2469.20] now is they're trying to tell you this
[2468.32 - 2471.60] copper pipes
[2469.20 - 2472.32] those are good for you and it's a bad
[2471.60 - 2475.12] trend
[2472.32 - 2476.16] it's a dangerous one i think it's really
[2475.12 - 2479.04] ignorant
[2476.16 - 2480.00] really negligent and it's sad that the
[2479.04 - 2482.16] guessing games have
[2480.00 - 2484.08] to go on in alternative health over and
[2482.16 - 2485.52] over again because in alternative health
[2484.08 - 2487.60] nobody knows why anybody's sick they
[2485.52 - 2489.76] never did and so it's back to the
[2487.60 - 2491.76] guessing games let's go try this now
[2489.76 - 2494.16] okay let's try this now
[2491.76 - 2496.40] you know let's take tons of vinegar and
[2494.16 - 2498.40] destroy all our teeth let's
[2496.40 - 2499.52] you know and and and give us and give us
[2498.40 - 2501.76] osteopenia
[2499.52 - 2504.00] and you know like it's always a guessing
[2501.76 - 2505.76] game and it's so sad you guys
[2504.00 - 2507.68] and if anybody here is watching this
[2505.76 - 2508.64] doesn't believe me and you're like oh no
[2507.68 - 2510.96] he doesn't no
[2508.64 - 2512.88] fine fine do whatever it is you want to
[2510.96 - 2514.96] do do whatever it is you think is right
[2512.88 - 2516.72] do all the copper you want do all
[2514.96 - 2518.72] whatever you want do all the fermented
[2516.72 - 2520.16] foods you want perfectly fine with that
[2518.72 - 2521.60] if you're sick down the road remember
[2520.16 - 2522.72] this information is here for you down
[2521.60 - 2525.84] the road you might have a different
[2522.72 - 2529.20] opinion 10 years from now
[2525.84 - 2529.20] you guys are making some salsa
[2530.48 - 2534.08] so much sherry says so much
[2532.32 - 2536.64] contradiction information
[2534.08 - 2539.44] with fat everyone does different i guess
[2536.64 - 2541.44] on different diets no one size fits all
[2539.44 - 2543.92] sure i wish that was true that's not
[2541.44 - 2546.56] true here's how it works
[2543.92 - 2548.16] we're all human beings and our livers
[2546.56 - 2551.28] don't like a lot of fat
[2548.16 - 2553.04] period but we react differently
[2551.28 - 2554.48] because some of our livers are better
[2553.04 - 2556.56] how in better health than
[2554.48 - 2557.92] other people's liver livers okay
[2556.56 - 2559.60] someone's liver
[2557.92 - 2561.12] could be less toxic in the moment in
[2559.60 - 2562.16] their life so they can handle more fat
[2561.12 - 2563.76] and then all of a sudden you're thinking
[2562.16 - 2566.00] well that person's just different
[2563.76 - 2567.36] they're different than me and one one
[2566.00 - 2569.52] size doesn't fit all
[2567.36 - 2572.08] and you know but that's not how it works
[2569.52 - 2573.92] it does fit all if it's all as a huge as
[2572.08 - 2576.16] human the human race
[2573.92 - 2578.64] our pancreases hate a lot of fat in our
[2576.16 - 2580.72] diet and one person's pancreas
[2578.64 - 2582.64] that can get weakened over time can go
[2580.72 - 2583.52] into pancreatitis faster than someone
[2582.64 - 2585.92] else okay
[2583.52 - 2587.52] someone else's liver can get fatty liver
[2585.92 - 2588.24] and get more fat built up in it than
[2587.52 - 2590.48] someone else
[2588.24 - 2592.88] faster than someone else but in the end
[2590.48 - 2594.88] every body gets something
[2592.88 - 2597.20] you can be the one someone can be the
[2594.88 - 2598.96] one that just seems like they do fat
[2597.20 - 2600.56] fine with all that high fat and then
[2598.96 - 2601.36] later on they get their heart attack at
[2600.56 - 2603.20] 75
[2601.36 - 2604.56] they get their heart attack at 72. they
[2603.20 - 2605.84] did good all those years
[2604.56 - 2607.68] they were eating all that fat and
[2605.84 - 2608.64] finally all that fat builds up inside
[2607.68 - 2610.96] their arteries
[2608.64 - 2612.48] that fat build up inside their heart and
[2610.96 - 2614.16] boom they got their heart attack just
[2612.48 - 2616.80] like that you know
[2614.16 - 2618.88] so it's important to know okay and like
[2616.80 - 2621.04] all that fat that we're told to eat
[2618.88 - 2622.16] whether it's nuts and seeds and avocados
[2621.04 - 2624.88] and milk cheese butter
[2622.16 - 2626.56] and whatever it is right chicken fat
[2624.88 - 2628.24] gets built up in these arteries
[2626.56 - 2629.84] over time it gets built up inside the
[2628.24 - 2632.32] veins and what
[2629.84 - 2634.72] fat does is it pulls the toxin in and
[2632.32 - 2637.68] then becomes plaque plaque
[2634.72 - 2638.24] is rancid fat hardened on the inside of
[2637.68 - 2639.84] the
[2638.24 - 2641.60] the inside of the heart in arteries and
[2639.84 - 2644.88] veins and blood vessels
[2641.60 - 2645.92] and it's infused with toxins or toxins
[2644.88 - 2648.64] are infused in it
[2645.92 - 2649.12] okay these are radical fats milk cheese
[2648.64 - 2653.20] butter
[2649.12 - 2655.12] eggs coconut oil canola oil olive oil
[2653.20 - 2656.72] all different oils avocados now i'm not
[2655.12 - 2658.08] saying they're not healthy fats i'm not
[2656.72 - 2660.56] saying avocado
[2658.08 - 2661.36] and coconut's not a healthy fat it is
[2660.56 - 2663.52] but what i am
[2661.36 - 2665.92] saying is we inundate ourselves with so
[2663.52 - 2666.88] many fats of all kinds it all becomes
[2665.92 - 2668.48] one in the end
[2666.88 - 2670.40] you're doing chicken too much chicken
[2668.48 - 2672.08] every single day you're doing 10 000
[2670.40 - 2673.92] chickens in 15 years
[2672.08 - 2675.68] it's and then you're still doing coconut
[2673.92 - 2677.04] oil and you're still doing avocado and
[2675.68 - 2678.96] you're still eating nuts
[2677.04 - 2680.72] it builds up and it builds up and you're
[2678.96 - 2681.92] still doing oils and it builds up and
[2680.72 - 2683.44] you're still doing chocolate and it
[2681.92 - 2684.00] builds up and guess what you get the
[2683.44 - 2685.84] plaque
[2684.00 - 2688.16] and you need the stints later on you're
[2685.84 - 2690.16] 55 years old you're 65 years old and
[2688.16 - 2691.76] they're running a scope up your arteries
[2690.16 - 2694.56] and intervenes and they're putting
[2691.76 - 2696.64] stints in to keep them from collapsing
[2694.56 - 2697.52] because so much fat build up inside
[2696.64 - 2699.44] those arteries
[2697.52 - 2701.12] meanwhile no one's going to pay the
[2699.44 - 2701.68] price you think all those gurus that
[2701.12 - 2702.96] told you
[2701.68 - 2704.80] tons of fat do you think they're going
[2702.96 - 2705.84] to pay the price and when you're 62
[2704.80 - 2706.96] years old and you're laying on the
[2705.84 - 2709.52] operating table
[2706.96 - 2710.88] no they're not going to care about you
[2709.52 - 2712.56] no one's going to care about you
[2710.88 - 2714.00] all the trend setters that are like
[2712.56 - 2714.48] they're they're like parroting each
[2714.00 - 2716.40] other
[2714.48 - 2717.76] and everybody's afraid to speak up about
[2716.40 - 2718.48] anything and they're all like no no
[2717.76 - 2720.96] fat's great
[2718.48 - 2722.56] lots of fat okay lots of fat too over
[2720.96 - 2724.00] there you think any of them are going to
[2722.56 - 2725.60] care when you're on the operating table
[2724.00 - 2727.44] again you're getting your valve replaced
[2725.60 - 2729.44] because it was just lined with total
[2727.44 - 2731.20] fat and corrosion and all kinds of
[2729.44 - 2733.04] plaque they're not going to care
[2731.20 - 2734.64] but you're going to pay the price 10 15
[2733.04 - 2736.88] years 20 years later
[2734.64 - 2739.68] that's how it works they don't care
[2736.88 - 2742.88] about you all the trendsetters and gurus
[2739.68 - 2742.88] that's that's how it happens
[2743.68 - 2747.28] i'm not saying you can't eat fats we're
[2745.44 - 2751.60] having guacamole tonight
[2747.28 - 2753.60] not saying that taryn we're not all rich
[2751.60 - 2758.40] these products are expensive

[2760.40 - 2765.84] whatever that is the whole bit with it
[2762.40 - 2767.60] whoa i mean and and trying to keep good
[2765.84 - 2770.08] health insurance and then
[2767.60 - 2771.76] that's expensive all on its own and then

[2771.76 - 2776.32] expenses when you're sick

[3006.96 - 3011.36] what if you're a diabetic lowering fats
[3010.40 - 3013.04] is actually
[3011.36 - 3014.40] the best thing you can do is diabetic
[3013.04 - 3015.84] okay you can always ask your doctor
[3014.40 - 3017.12] what's right for you but that's what i
[3015.84 - 3019.92] recommend friends and family
[3017.12 - 3022.56] to do is lowering their fat intake so
[3019.92 - 3024.56] try not to eat too many fats
[3022.56 - 3025.76] what that means is that you're keeping
[3024.56 - 3027.92] your fats like
[3025.76 - 3029.68] say chicken or beef if you're eating
[3027.92 - 3030.88] animal products to once a day maybe at
[3029.68 - 3032.96] the end of the day
[3030.88 - 3034.64] during the day you're not having a lot
[3032.96 - 3035.68] of avocado you're not having a lot of
[3034.64 - 3037.20] oils oils
[3035.68 - 3038.64] really get the diabetics i'm just going
[3037.20 - 3039.92] to be straight out if there's one thing
[3038.64 - 3041.28] you can do and you can ask your doctor
[3039.92 - 3044.24] what your doctor thinks
[3041.28 - 3045.20] the one thing you can do is minimizing
[3044.24 - 3048.08] your oils
[3045.20 - 3048.48] right there that that alone is a big
[3048.08 - 3051.20] deal
[3048.48 - 3052.64] so i'm going to make this salsa what's
[3051.20 - 3055.84] going to do
[3052.64 - 3059.04] and the other thing is it's it's sugar
[3055.84 - 3060.72] isn't the demon when it comes down to
[3059.04 - 3062.48] diabetes okay
[3060.72 - 3064.64] uh you shouldn't be on table sugar you
[3062.48 - 3066.80] shouldn't be on unprocessed sugar
[3064.64 - 3068.80] i'm talking about fruit is not the
[3066.80 - 3072.16] problem with diabetics
[3068.80 - 3074.40] it's fats so here's how it works when
[3072.16 - 3076.00] you eat too much fat and fats in your
[3074.40 - 3078.96] bloodstream
[3076.00 - 3080.08] it stops the sugar from getting into
[3078.96 - 3083.36] your cells
[3080.08 - 3086.48] we only live function from
[3083.36 - 3087.76] sugar entering our cells that's how we
[3086.48 - 3091.12] can talk walk
[3087.76 - 3094.00] hence blood sugar is why we're alive
[3091.12 - 3095.36] right it's blood sugar but the more fat
[3094.00 - 3097.84] you eat
[3095.36 - 3099.52] the more your pancreas gets stressed out
[3097.84 - 3100.80] more your liver is probably gets more
[3099.52 - 3103.28] problematic
[3100.80 - 3104.00] and the more insulin the more fat you
[3103.28 - 3106.00] eat the more
[3104.00 - 3107.12] insulin your pancreas has to release
[3106.00 - 3109.52] that hormone
[3107.12 - 3110.64] in order to bind onto sugar to enter it
[3109.52 - 3113.44] into your cells right
[3110.64 - 3114.64] you lower your fats less insulin needs
[3113.44 - 3116.56] to be produced
[3114.64 - 3118.80] and type 2 diabetes i can't tell you how
[3116.56 - 3121.36] many cases reversed reversed 100 percent
[3118.80 - 3123.52] they don't even have type 2. i i know so
[3121.36 - 3126.40] many people that had type 2
[3123.52 - 3127.04] including using insulin with their type
[3126.40 - 3130.32] 2
[3127.04 - 3130.56] and other drugs and drugs and they beat
[3130.32 - 3133.92] it
[3130.56 - 3135.60] their type 2 diabetes free for life
[3133.92 - 3137.28] they just had to lower their fats learn
[3135.60 - 3138.64] how to heal you know i mean
[3137.28 - 3140.00] it's just it's great information all
[3138.64 - 3141.92] right let's just make the salsa right
[3140.00 - 3145.60] here we're doing that
[3141.92 - 3147.84] um need a clove of garlic it's one thing
[3145.60 - 3148.96] you can do less garlic you can do a
[3147.84 - 3150.64] little bit of garlic i'm just going to
[3148.96 - 3153.84] use a small clove of garlic
[3150.64 - 3153.84] okay you guys don't mind
[3157.20 - 3161.44] so dark good to see you um you gotta you
[3161.12 - 3163.04] gotta
[3161.44 - 3165.92] you got a thought there question well
[3163.04 - 3167.20] the heart primarily runs on fat the
[3165.92 - 3170.56] heart's a muscle
[3167.20 - 3172.24] it runs on sugar that's how
[3170.56 - 3172.64] misinformation works i'm putting a
[3172.24 - 3176.24] little
[3172.64 - 3179.52] garlic inside this this salsa
[3176.24 - 3181.36] your heart is a muscle
[3179.52 - 3182.72] insulin drive sugar into your heart
[3181.36 - 3186.40] cells
[3182.72 - 3188.96] that's how it works um
[3186.40 - 3191.12] why do you think doctors still are
[3188.96 - 3194.16] worried about too much red meat
[3191.12 - 3196.32] why do you think doctors
[3194.16 - 3197.52] were worried about too many eggs and too
[3196.32 - 3199.84] much red meat
[3197.52 - 3200.80] because it'll get you a heart attack
[3199.84 - 3203.36] because
[3200.80 - 3205.28] fat here's how it works okay the more
[3203.36 - 3207.68] fat you put in your bloodstream
[3205.28 - 3208.96] the harder your heart has to work now
[3207.68 - 3210.64] they didn't know that part that's
[3208.96 - 3213.52] medical medium information
[3210.64 - 3215.44] but the more fat in your bloodstream see
[3213.52 - 3218.40] doctors just believe
[3215.44 - 3220.08] that in the medical the surgeon general
[3218.40 - 3223.76] many many years ago
[3220.08 - 3225.20] many years ago decades ago believed
[3223.76 - 3228.64] and they taught us at the medical
[3225.20 - 3230.64] universities that too much red meat
[3228.64 - 3233.12] and it's going to lead to a heart attack
[3230.64 - 3234.72] and they're right about that
[3233.12 - 3237.44] all that fat's going to plack up and
[3234.72 - 3239.60] build up inside your heart right
[3237.44 - 3241.68] so all that fat running through your
[3239.60 - 3244.08] heart okay
[3241.68 - 3245.36] is going to build up inside your heart
[3244.08 - 3247.12] right
[3245.36 - 3249.84] fat thickens the blood and when the
[3247.12 - 3251.60] blood gets thick
[3249.84 - 3253.04] heart has to kill itself to pump it
[3251.60 - 3256.64] through
[3253.04 - 3259.36] it's like it's like sucking a milkshake
[3256.64 - 3260.16] through a straw versus water through a
[3259.36 - 3262.72] straw
[3260.16 - 3264.88] so when your heart's pumping so so dark
[3262.72 - 3265.76] right so dark check this out when your
[3264.88 - 3269.60] heart's pumping
[3265.76 - 3272.08] it's killing itself to suck that fat
[3269.60 - 3273.12] through the the veins to draw that fat
[3272.08 - 3275.76] up through the veins
[3273.12 - 3277.68] the heart is killing itself whoa there's
[3275.76 - 3278.00] so much fat in that blood it's so thick
[3277.68 - 3279.68] i
[3278.00 - 3281.60] can't that's why they give you blood
[3279.68 - 3282.96] thinners you start getting all those
[3281.60 - 3284.32] problems and heart problems and blood
[3282.96 - 3285.68] vessel problems they're just like oh my
[3284.32 - 3286.48] god they start giving you blood thinners
[3285.68 - 3287.92] is what they do
[3286.48 - 3289.92] they're trying to thin out your blood so
[3287.92 - 3294.08] your heart can even pump that stuff
[3289.92 - 3294.08] see so no fat kills your heart
[3297.12 - 3300.08] you can't doesn't mean you guys have to

[3694.96 - 3698.72] information are already getting sick
[3697.12 - 3701.04] why else do people just start doing
[3698.72 - 3702.72] stuff you know
[3701.04 - 3704.16] or they've been sick a long time they
[3702.72 - 3705.52] start medical meme information because
[3704.16 - 3708.16] they've been sick a long time they've
[3705.52 - 3710.24] had problems going on for a long time
[3708.16 - 3711.76] but a lot of people go to medical meal
[3710.24 - 3713.20] information after being healthy for a
[3711.76 - 3714.80] long time or feeling healthy and what
[3713.20 - 3716.00] happens is they got something coming on
[3714.80 - 3717.60] they're starting to feel it and they'll
[3716.00 - 3718.88] get this instinct like whoa i'm not
[3717.60 - 3719.92] feeling that good i better start
[3718.88 - 3720.88] something and then they start medical
[3719.92 - 3722.72] medium information
[3720.88 - 3724.00] but what was coming on was already
[3722.72 - 3725.36] coming on and then
[3724.00 - 3727.68] they're like whoa wait a minute is it
[3725.36 - 3729.36] the mm info is it whatever but what they
[3727.68 - 3731.04] don't know is the mm info is really
[3729.36 - 3732.88] protecting them so it wouldn't come on
[3731.04 - 3734.64] even worse or they can get it better
[3732.88 - 3738.64] even faster later
[3734.64 - 3738.64] a lot of people also you know but yeah

[3772.72 - 3776.24] clean advanced cleanse repeatedly as an
[3775.36 - 3777.76] option
[3776.24 - 3779.76] that's what i would do so i'd do the
[3777.76 - 3783.20] advanced 369 repeatedly
[3779.76 - 3784.88] as an option if i had acne or i would do
[3783.20 - 3786.24] a mono eating cleanse in there i'd be
[3784.88 - 3790.32] doing 32 ounces
[3786.24 - 3790.32] of celery juice if i had acne
[3793.52 - 3798.80] okay guys i'm gonna get some garlic in
[3795.20 - 3800.72] here making some guacamole as we speak
[3798.80 - 3802.24] and i would make sure there's no grains
[3800.72 - 3804.64] including oatmeal
[3802.24 - 3805.84] oatmeal won't feed strep it won't but
[3804.64 - 3807.84] it's a grain
[3805.84 - 3808.96] that that takes up space and you could
[3807.84 - 3810.08] be eating something else it could be
[3808.96 - 3812.72] more healthful like potato
[3810.08 - 3814.64] or something okay so i'm making the
[3812.72 - 3815.84] guacamole i put some garlic in there and
[3814.64 - 3818.48] i'm trying to look
[3815.84 - 3820.08] and i will see i'm looking at your
[3818.48 - 3821.12] comments you guys see if i see anything
