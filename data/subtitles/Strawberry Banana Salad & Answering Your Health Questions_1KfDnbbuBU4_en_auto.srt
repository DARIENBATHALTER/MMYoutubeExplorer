years and years

21
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,879

22
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:45,120
out of all the diet belief systems out

23
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:46,719
there it's always been the leafy greens

24
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,760
it's been missing in all the plant-based

25
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,360
diets

26
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,280

28
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,280

30
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,960
been missing

31
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:00,079
and medical medium information has put

32
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,399

164
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,160

hi there it's moringa

184
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,280
and then i saw something about spirulina

185
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:12,080
moringa's not spirulina

186
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,479
and meringue is not as good as spirulina

187
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,400
um

188
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:17,759

00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,960
healing things you really need to know

203
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,520

different things that like products that

207
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,440
have been out over the years but

208
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,960
you can put as many trendy products as

209
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:00,160
you want out there

210
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,280
and you know something can be a buzz hey

211
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,520
moringa

212
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,560
neem oil you know whatever you want to

213
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:08,000
throw out there

214
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,800
but it doesn't mean that it fixes

215
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,880
something

216
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,400
like what's wrong with you what's going

anxiety

222
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,080
and so moringa can't remove toxic heavy

223
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,000
metals

224
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,440

but spirulina can the right kind of

227
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,759
spirulina can just like that

228
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,520
um so i'm just mixing up some greens i

start chopping up some strawberries and

233
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,919

that that's all right

241
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:05,599
so i got this all set here

242
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:07,759
leafy greens are not a vegetable just

243
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,440
always keep that in mind so it's not a

244
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,960
vegetable it's not like hey i'm having

245
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,879
my vegetables

246
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,479
nope it's not a vegetable it's a leafy

247
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,879
green it's separate

248
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:18,080
so you got the wild foods you got the

249
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:21,199
leafy greens

250
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:24,080
you got your fruits okay you got your

251
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:27,680
vegetables you got your sea vegetables

252
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:29,120
so but you know this

253
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,960
you know so it's in and then you got

254
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,960
your herbs of course um

255
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,800
so i'm just reading some questions here

256
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,360
i find it i find it have a lot of sugar

257
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,000
wondering

258
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,519
if it's not healthy so i'm not sure if

259
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,959
like when it comes down to bananas and

260
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:50,080
strawberries

261
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,560
that's not the the wrong kind of sugar

262
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,040
so

263
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,080
you know high fructose corn syrup that's

264
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,440
a bad sugar

265
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:59,519
table sugar that's a bad sugar and sugar

266
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,360
isn't the problem when it comes down to

267
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,040
sickness when it comes down to

268
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,360
you know having poor health or symptoms

269
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,360
and conditions it's the fats

270
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,440
so keep that in mind so it's always the

271
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:12,480
fat so in chocolate cake

272
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,920
it's not the sugar that's the real scary

273
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,560
part in chocolate cake

274
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,440
it's the fat it's the butter it's the

275
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,600
oil

276
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,399
it's the lard it's anything like that

277
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,959
that's inside a chocolate cake

278
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,680
and so it's the fats in the chocolate

279
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:28,560
cake

280
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,959
that cause the damage not the sugar so

281
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,800
then

282
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:32,560
everybody gets scared and they're like

283
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:35,440
i'm not gonna have a strawberry

284
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,000
i'm not gonna have a banana and we need

285
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,880
sugar to

286
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,040
survive without sugar we die so we can't

287
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,360
think we can't function we can't walk we

288
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:46,160
can't exercise we can't talk

289
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,120
and that's why you know they even care

290
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,959
about our

291
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,560
sugar you know that's why they even care

292
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:53,040
about our sugar blood

293
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,920
sugar is critical to stay alive it's

294
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,600
also why

295
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,279
how do you save a diabetic's life when

296
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,120
they're on the floor

297
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,800
you know somewhere in a store and

298
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,240
they're just they're seizuring out

299
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,440
and they're just literally laying on a

300
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,480
floor somewhere and they look like

301
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,560
they're drunk

302
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,680
and everybody's walking by them and it's

303
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,360
a diabetic well

304
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,959
you bring a little bit of orange juice

305
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,480
with it over to them

306
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,480
they drink a little orange juice and

307
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,360
they they're actually able to get off

308
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,360
the floor

309
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,040
and get home and hop into a car can't

310
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,760
tell you how many times i've heard the

311
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,839
story heard

312
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,120
from doctors i heard it from people who

313
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,399
are diabetics

314
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,240
it's like all of a sudden they're

315
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,240
flatline they're on the floor somewhere

316
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,079
in a grocery store or

317
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,760
they're out shopping and they're laying

318
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:33,040
on a sidewalk and everybody's just

319
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,519
walking by them

320
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,440
and they're just like hunched over and

321
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,519
no one knows what's going on

322
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,160
and all they needed was a sip of orange

323
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:44,720
juice sip of sugar to get them off the

324
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:46,720
ground and save their life so it's

325
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,079
it's really not like people think it's

326
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,959
really how it works

327
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:52,880
um what happens is we eat so much fat

328
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:56,320
that we trap the sugar

329
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:58,240
in our bloodstream and then the sugar

330
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,920
becomes a little bit of a problem then

331
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,800
but it's not the sugar in the end it's

332
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,160
the fat

333
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,079
that's in our bloodstream then we get

334
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,399
the insulin resistance

335
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:09,279
and then that insulin can't carry the

336
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,519
sugar into the cells of the body because

337
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,160
of

338
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:13,600
all the fat so you don't want to be

339
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,440
afraid of a strawberry when you take a

340
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,160
look at this strawberry right here and

341
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,839
i got them right here look at these so

342
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,240
see the strawberries right here you guys

343

that's a beautiful strawberry right here

344
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,399
so

345
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:28,959
that is a healing food an incredible

346
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,880
healing food everybody's worried about

347
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,200
how they look with aging they're worried

348
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,279
about

349
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,399
wrinkles they're worried about aging too

350
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:37,040
fast

351
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:38,800
and they're worried about their skin

352
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,160
they're worried about their nails

353

they're worried about all of that

354
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,560
and if you don't want to age you want

355
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,360
those kinds of foods right here so

356
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:49,519
look at that the strawberry but you know

357
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:53,040

359
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,079

the medical medium book one the new

459

edition

460
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:22,000
that's the all-time like information

461
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,639
about lyme disease

462
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
lyme disease is not bacterial so if that

463
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:29,120
turns you off or gets you

464
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,920
upset don't let it because

465
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:34,480
science and research have now because of

466
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:36,240
medical medium information in fact

467
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,839
a famous doctor just reached out to me

468
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,240
recently and said that

469
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,199
he's really happy that that's medical

470
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,199
science

471
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:44,480
took lyme disease out of the bacteria

472
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,240
category so

473
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,519
they don't believe it's bacteria anymore

474
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,839
because

475
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:52,320
of the millions of medical medium books

476
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:55,519
that told the truth that it's viral

477
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:57,360
so so millions of people took

478
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,880
the book the first book the first

479
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,480
edition right this is the second edition

480
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,040
they took the book into their doctor's

481
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,079
offices

482
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:05,199
and said he says it's viral and so

483
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:08,079
because of that it

484
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:09,839
changed lyme disease so all these years

485
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,839
later now they took they removed lyme

486
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,600
disease out of bacterial and now it's an

487
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,040
autoimmune category which means they

488
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,120
don't know the cause of it

489
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,720
but autoimmune the cause of autoimmune

490
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,360
is viral so just letting you know

491
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,079
so the first way to heal lyme disease is

492
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,600
to know

493
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:27,680
what the cause is what's causing my

494
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,759
symptoms what's causing my neurological

495
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:33,360
symptoms that someone

496
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:36,480
that a doctor says is lyme disease um

497
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:38,079
and so viruses such as epstein-barr

498
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,839
and here's the funny thing it's not

499
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:42,560
funny but interesting

500
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:45,120
is that doctors check they test for

501
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,720
epstein-barr now with lyme patients

502
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,600
because of medical medium books because

503
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:52,720
i said that hey lyme disease is caused

504
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,440
by epstein-barr and shingles okay and so

505
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,839
what they do

506
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,360
is they test for epstein-barr lyme you

507
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,800
know lyme patients they get tested for

508
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,399
that so they're always getting a lyme

509
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,480
test and an epstein-barr test now

510
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:04,400
they're getting both at the same time

511
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:07,120
because of medical medium books so i'm

512
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:10,319
cutting up these strawberries

513
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:11,839
right here putting some nice strawberry

514
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,600
pieces in the salad

515
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:15,679
you can cut them up as small as you want

516
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,480
to cut them up these are the sizes i'm

517
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:19,839
cutting up

518
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,839
cutting them up right here

519
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,520
so putting some nice strawberry pieces

520
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,959
on here

521
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,559
strawberry banana salad is what i'm

522
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:31,280
making you guys

523
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:33,919
when you eat a food like this when you

524
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:37,039
eat a recipe like this

525
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:40,400
be mindful for what it's doing for you

526
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:41,360
like keep that in your consciousness

527
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,880
okay

528
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:47,919
because when you respect the food

529
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,200
that's actually healing you a connection

530
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,919
is made

531
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,280
that's really important to know and hey

532
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:54,559
if you don't respect the food that's

533
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,160
healing you and you don't care and

534
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:57,919
you're just eating it or trying it out

535
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,960
it's still gonna help heal you

536
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:04,000
but so i want to talk about

537
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,320
why healing foods are so important for

538
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,760
us

539
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:09,679
one thing is fragrances okay so

540
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,760
fragrances that are made from chemical

541
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:13,440
companies that saturate us every day so

542
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,600
when you go into the store

543
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,640
you get hit you get assaulted by

544
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:20,080
fragrances

545
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:22,240
that's colognes that's perfumes and then

546
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,360
we're taught by chemical companies to

547
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,240
breathe it in to

548
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,120
like the smell air fresheners scented

549
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,760
candles

550
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:31,039
so here's the thing everybody's so

551
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,360
health-minded these days

552
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:35,360

556
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,440
everybody knows a little bit something

557
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:45,919
about health right but at the same time

558
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,360
they seem to know a lot about health or

559
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:49,760
seem to know anything about health

560
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:51,200
they're lighting the candles so they're

561
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,559

569
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,080

579
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,760
greasy foods

00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:01,039
people do

711
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:04,080

712
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:06,480

00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:19,120
people that are into yoga yoga studios

720
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:21,600
that are like burning incense that have

721
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:23,520
chemicals in them and it's like hey a

722
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:26,960
friend of mine was at a yoga studio

723
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:29,039
and said this the smell was so strong

724
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,960
her eyes were burning it's because a lot

725
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:33,440
of the incense is not like

726
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:35,039
natural it's got chemicals in it the

727
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,960
fragrances are in there so you want

728
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:38,640
fragrance free wherever you go

729
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,080
you want to protect yourself when you

730
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,799
order new clothes

731
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,200
saturated with all kinds of chemicals

732
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:46,080
and

733
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,679
you got to think about children and you

734
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:50,080
got to think about babies

735
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:51,919
and if you got air fresheners in your

736
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:54,159
house pull them out of the wall

737
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:55,360
throw them out so that your babies

738
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,120
aren't breathing that in

739
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:59,039
just that's how you do it that's how you

740
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:01,120
protect your families

741
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:02,880
and get rid of the scented candles

742
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,640
because those are killers

743
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,320
those are killers and they're really

744
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,880

00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:14,159
we're being trained to be poisoned we

748
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:17,200
really are and that's what's happening

749
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:19,120
and what's in these fragrances

750
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,640
are toxic heavy metals so that's another

751
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,200
thing too if you just guys just got on

752
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,799
there

753
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,640
i'm on a rant right here about

754
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:26,720
fragrances toxic heavy metals and

755
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:29,600
fragrances the poisons involved

756
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:31,120
how smoking is a joke compared to these

757
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,919
toxic chemicals that we're breathing in

758
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,360
every day

759
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:35,039
we're being trained to like the smell of

760
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,000
perfume we're being trained to breathe

761
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:39,039
in cologne it's

762
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,440
everywhere you walk into a grocery store

763
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:42,159
i mean it's pumping with all kinds of

764
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,320
cleaners

765
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:45,279
it's pumping with all kinds of cleaners

766
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,279
that they're spraying that they're

767
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:47,840
mopping floors with that are completely

768
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,559
toxic

769
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:52,000
it's it's pumping with clone aftershave

770
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:53,520
perfume everywhere

771
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,240
anyway i'm making the strawberry banana

772
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:57,200
salad it's a way to counter all this

773
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,520
stuff

774
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:01,120
so if you wonder why hey why should i

775
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:05,919
eat healthy

776
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:05,919
and another thing too is like

777
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,840
we should really like say something out

778
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:11,440
there you know we should talk about it

779
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:13,600
out there a little bit more we should

780
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,440
ask for the fragrance free the more you

781
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,880
ask the more you talk about it the more

782
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,760
they stop

783
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:21,279
and because you don't want all that

784
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,440
chemical soaking in your

785
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:24,880
your food right so i wash these

786
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:28,000
strawberries really good

787
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:30,320
because i noticed that when i got

788
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,240
these strawberries right that they had

789
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,200
like a cologne smell going on on the

790
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,880
packages

791
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:37,279
because of the store it had like a

792
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:39,679
chemical smell slash cologne smell

793
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:41,440
slash air freshener smell and i had to

794
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:43,360
wash these strawberries really good like

795
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:46,159
i had to wash them good

796
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:47,520
to actually get that off of them and

797
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:49,760
it's like it's just unfair

798
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:51,039
it's like what you know it's like you

799
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,480
may as well just bring the cigarettes

800
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:53,120
back man just bring them back

801
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,039
everybody's

802
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,400
smoke just why not who cares because

803
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:58,320
guess what we're doing

804
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,400
all the other stuff and it's killing us

805
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,159
so let's all just light up go into the

806
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,039
grocery stores light up everybody light

807
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:05,679
up and just

808
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:07,360
why not hey it's safer than all this

809
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:09,520
stuff i can tell you that it's actually

810
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:12,720
safer but no don't start smoking let's

811
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,720
get some bananas chopped up

812
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:19,279
anyway does that include organic

813
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,080
perfumes organic scented candles yes

814
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,760
because organic

815
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:24,960
doesn't mean anything because the

816
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:27,360
chemical fragrances get into those two

817
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,520
it's different if it's a candle that

818
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,640
just has an essential oil in it like

819
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:33,039
maybe it just

820
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:35,600
has essential oil and then beeswax

821
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:38,080
essential oil and then maybe a soy wax

822
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,039
say right and it's just a little bit of

823
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:42,399
that but

824
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:46,000
perfumes that even are organic are still

825
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:46,399
ladled in like chemical they're still in

826
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,399
there

827
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:51,200
that's the trick that's a whole nother

828
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:54,080
game too going on

829
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:56,480
um so i got some bananas so i'm just

830
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:58,080
going to cut them in these nice pieces

831
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,919
you don't want them too small but you

832
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,559
don't want them too big so i'm just

833
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:06,080
cutting them

834
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:06,080
right here this is a really nice banana

835
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,799
cigarettes are filled with chemicals

836
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:13,840
right yeah they are okay

837
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:13,840
scented candles

838
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:20,240
100 times worse i wouldn't even probably

839
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,840
worse than even 100 times

840
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:26,799
okay it's it's an oil base

841
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,679
scented candles have an oil base of a

842
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:30,000
soup

843
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:31,919
of dangerous chemicals synthetically

844
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,159
made in a chemical factory

845
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:35,520
that aren't tested no one knows what the

846
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:38,159
damage that it could be done

847
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:39,919
on people in their lungs their body how

848
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:42,960
it can promote cancer like

849
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:44,799
be literally a trigger for cancer

850
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,000
so here we're worried about cancer

851
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:47,679
everybody's worried about women are

852
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,080

853
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:51,600
and they're being assaulted with all

854
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,279
these chemicals 24 7

856
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:58,799
their children and

857

867
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:33,279

okay just a little drop a couple of

875
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:51,120
drops you just give it a good rinse

876
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:53,200
i'm gonna put these banana pieces in

877
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:57,760
it's a lot better than what could be

878
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:57,760
you know on the food from the store

879
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:03,520

martha says cologne smell perfume

882
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:11,200
scented detergent

883
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:14,000
candles air fresheners send me gagging

884
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:17,120
and running out of the room

885
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,520
rightfully so totally rightfully so for

886
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:21,679
real

887
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:23,120
because um it's that bad

888
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:24,720
make sure all your products are

889
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,799
fragrance free

890
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,159
that's that's important right there

891
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:31,039
here's the other thing too

892
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:32,960
they have us chemical companies right

893
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:35,200
have a so saturated with dangerous

894
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,880
chemicals all the time

895
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:39,200
that we don't know what we're smelling

896
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:42,720
anymore we don't know

897
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:45,840
if you're in a home or apartment

898
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,720
or wherever you live right and wherever

899
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:50,000
you are

900
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:51,840
and you're there and you don't

901
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,600
have all those fragrances and you don't

902
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:55,039
smell all the smells and then you walk

903
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,640
into somebody's house

904
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:58,399

910
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,399

00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:14,399
meanwhile

i want to go into that a little bit i

1031
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,599
want to talk about coffee too there's

1032
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:02,240
one thing that people don't realize

1033
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:04,320
that thousands and thousands and

1034
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,440
thousands of workers over the years have

1035
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,599
died

1036
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:09,280
picking coffee so everybody can have

1037
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:12,079
their cup and get jacked up on

1038
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:13,520
on the coffee high and it's it's kept

1039
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:14,880
kept on the down low

1040
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,960
no one talks about it because the

1041
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,720
caffeine industry is so powerful

1042
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,839
that they don't let that secret out

1043
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:22,079
right i talk about that in the medical

1044
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:24,720
medium podcast at apple podcast

1045
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:27,040

at apple podcast

1048
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,400
and it's like it's it's really

1049
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:34,880
disturbing how it works

1050
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,240
when you're picking coffee all day long

1051
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:38,000
and you're sweating

1052
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:40,240
and you're you're rubbing on you're

1053
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,520
rubbing on all of the leaves

1054
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:44,079
and you got you're rubbing on all the

1055
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:45,680
coffee and you're actually in the groves

1056
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:48,320
and you're getting covered with that

1057
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:49,839
toxin something happens and i talk all

1058
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,960
about it medical medium podcast at apple

1059
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:54,079
podcast and how many

1060
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:57,119
people have died all through the years

1061
00:36:54,079 --> 00:37:00,160
and how serious that is um

1062
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:00,960
and also we can have some coffee so we

1063
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,720
can have you know

1064
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:05,200
we can be jacked up in the morning so we

1065
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:06,560
can hide all our symptoms and issues

1066
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,880
that the medical industry doesn't want

1067
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:12,320
anybody to really know we have

1068
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:13,599
and you know and then

1069
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:16,400
that's how it works so i'm gonna put

1070
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:18,400
some banana in here

1071
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,480
doing about a third of a cup chopped

1072
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:22,880
banana

1073
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:24,079
you don't have to do a lot this is just

1074
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:27,359
the dressing

1075
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:27,359
i just lost a piece right there

1076
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:32,000
talk about chocolate in a minute too

1077
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,760
it's interesting there's no

1078
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,960
there's no such thing as fair trade when

1079
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:37,280
it comes down to chocolate or

1080
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:39,040
sustainable

1081
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,800
it's really sad when you see that market

1082
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:44,079
it like that because

1083
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:45,440
the farmers who are farming chocolate

1084
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:48,800
cacao

1085
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:52,400
they're penniless they're in utter

1086
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:53,920
poverty i mean i'm talking starvation

1087
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:56,720
poverty they make about 100

1088
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:57,760
100 a year so they sit there cutting

1089
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,599
cacao

1090
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:02,320
they kill themselves getting it to

1091
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:05,680
market they get ripped off they get paid

1092
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:08,800
nothing people in africa and

1093
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:11,119
what happens is that um

1094
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,320
i mean we're talking they're in poverty

1095
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:15,440
and they get ripped off

1096
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:16,960
so when when their cacao is bought for

1097
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:19,359
them purchased from them

1098
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,880
so it can go into into the market and

1099
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:22,480
then become like chocolate cake

1100
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,359
chocolate candies chocolate whatever

1101
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:27,119
cacao

1102
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:30,079
nibs what happens is that when when that

1103
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:31,839
when that um chocolate finally moves

1104
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:33,440
into the market nobody knows what

1105
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:35,119
happened and where it came from and

1106
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,320
everybody's ripped off so all the

1107
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:39,119
farmers are ripped

1108
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:40,320
off they given they're given pennies

1109
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:41,920
they're starving they get

1110
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,680
cheated and they're sitting there

1111
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,200
sweating killing killing themselves

1112
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:47,920
their families are trying to pick

1113
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,880
a cow off trees so they can get one

1114
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,839
penny

00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:53,440
for like five pods of cacao one penny

1116
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:56,400
for like 50 pods of

1117
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:57,839
one nickel for 50 pods of cacao right

1118
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,359
and so when you go in and you're buying

1119
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:00,640
your chocolate bar you get your cacao

1120
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:02,000
nibs and you're throwing on top your

1121
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,400
smoothies you're throwing it on top of

1122
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,240
your

1123
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,440
your food and everything like that and

1124
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,160
everybody's telling you to plant

1125
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:08,000
medicine

1126
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:09,599
it's good for you and meanwhile just

1127
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,880
getting you high and jacking you up on

1128
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:13,440
caffeine which

1129
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:14,000
ages you fast and nobody realizes it

1130
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,800
well you're being

1131
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:19,599
told all that and you wouldn't believe

1132
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:22,720
the wake of a disaster that's occurring

1133
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:24,720
for the growers i mean it's so sad it's

1134
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:26,720
devastating it's like armageddon it's

1135
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,119
like literally the apocalypse it's so

1136
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,520
bad

1137
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:31,280
and they're intense and they're

1138
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:33,520
literally dying some of them

1139
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:36,000
intense they try to they get up they try

1140
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:38,160
to they try to pick more cacao for you

1141
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,079
and and they're getting pennies some of

1142
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:42,320
them some families only make 50

1143
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:43,440
for a whole year of harvesting and

1144
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:45,839
killing themselves

1145
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:47,200
getting cacao ready for the market and

1146
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:49,200
when you think about that and then they

1147
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:51,119
say oh it's sustainable this cacao is

1148
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,079
sustainable this chocolate's sustainable

1149
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:53,920
it's fair trade

1150
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:57,520
it's like are you freaking kidding me

1151
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:59,920
that's just sick it's actually demented

1152
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:02,560
all right let's make it let's make it

1153
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,560
dressing here

1154
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:07,280
it's always something something to talk

1155
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:11,200
about you guys

1156
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:13,119
always something to talk about so

1157
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:16,240
i got a little strainer here so i'm

1158
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:18,400
gonna just drop some lemon juice in here

1159
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:20,960
so you could do like one one teaspoon

1160
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:25,440
two teaspoons

1161
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:28,640
i'm gonna try for one teaspoon in here

1162
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:28,640
to get it to spin

1163
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:33,520
you do um and then i'm going to add a

1164
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:35,599
little bit of water too

1165
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,800
so a tablespoon of water one to three

1166
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:39,359
tablespoons of water

1167
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:42,560
let's put a little bit of that in there

1168
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:42,560
i'm gonna try to blend this up

1169
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:49,200

i like my dressing on the side you can

1179
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:36,480
pour it on the salad if you like

1180
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:38,720
but i like my dressing on the side as i

1181
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:40,400
just spilled a little bit of it

1182
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:42,720
so i wanted to show you guys so i angled

1183
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:46,000
it your way see so that's the dressing

1184
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:46,000

1190
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:00,240
perfectly fine

1191
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:02,079
what i do is i kind of like do that and

1192
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:03,680
i dip it into the dressing

1193
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:05,680
that's the way i do but everybody's got

1194
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:07,280
their own their own you know little

1195
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:10,319
thing that they do

1196
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:11,839
so so you know i want to talk

1197
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:13,680
you guys got a couple more minutes about

1198
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:14,560
that about this i want to talk about a

1199
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,520
little bit more about

1200
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:17,200
the things going out there with

1201
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:18,160
chocolate the things going on with

1202
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:20,240
women's health

1203
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:21,839
fragrances and stuff like that this is

1204
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,280
the strawberry banana salad

1205
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:25,280
just made it that's the butter leaf

1206
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:28,480
lettuce right there okay

1207
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:31,200
you see that um spinach okay

1208
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,880
spinach trace mineral salts for the

1209
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,520
brain

1210
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:35,280
neurotransmitters so your

1211
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:37,200
neurotransmitters they get dehydrated

1212
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:38,560
and they dry up so here's what happens

1213
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,760
everybody's doing their caffeine and you

1214
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,560
could do your caffeine you could do your

1215
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,240
chocolate i'm not

1216
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:44,000
picking on anybody here i'm just telling

1217
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:45,760
you what's happening so you know

1218
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,760
but when you when you do when you're

1219
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:50,400
when you're all cranked up

1220
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:52,480
on the caffeine what it's doing is it's

1221
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:55,359
burning out your neurotransmitters

1222
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:57,520
so those neurotransmitters are priceless

1223
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:59,280
those neurotransmitters are how you can

1224
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:00,960
think in the end how you could keep your

1225
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:02,560
brain alive long when you

1226
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:04,480
when you're older so you don't get

1227
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:07,920
alzheimer's you don't get dementia

1228
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:10,240
and caffeine is a fast track to dementia

1229
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:12,079
it's a fast track to alzheimer's because

1230
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:13,520
what the caffeine does is it cranks up

1231
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:15,119
your adrenals then your

1232
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:17,599
adrenals are pumping pump and pump and

1233
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:19,440
pump and pump in and that adrenaline

1234
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:21,119
scorches all your neurotransmitters

1235
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:22,319
inside your brain so your electrical

1236
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:23,599
impulses they need those

1237
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:24,880
neurotransmitters

1238
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:26,720
your neurons need those

1239
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:27,200
neurotransmitters your glial cells need

1240
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:29,200
those

1241
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:31,440
neurotransmitters and so what the

1242
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:33,680
caffeine does is it stimulates your

1243
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:35,839
adrenals your adrenals end up pumping in

1244
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:37,160
all that epinephrine the epinephrine

1245
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:38,400
just starts to eat away at your

1246
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:40,160
neurotransmitters

1247
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:42,640
and then you get that like you're in

1248
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:43,520
your 50s you're in your 60s and just

1249
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,720
like what

1250
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,400
and you just start forgetting like

1251
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:48,000
where's my car keys for the set for the

1252
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:49,359
50th time

1253
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,359
wait a minute i don't think i could get

1254
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:52,480
my way home now i don't i think i'm lost

1255
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:55,040
on in the car

1256
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:56,560
like all that stuff starts happening and

1257
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:58,800
oh no one ever said

1258
00:43:56,560 --> 00:44:00,160
20 years of coffee could cause this no

1259
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:02,000
no one ever said

1260
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:04,400
you know all those years of chocolate

1261
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,319
caffeine coffee tea espresso

1262
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:07,680
is gonna burn out my neurotransmitters

1263
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:09,599
and then when you got the heavy metals

1264
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:10,480
in there it's worse worse worse makes it

1265
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:12,800
worse

1266
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:14,000
and and no one ever tells women that the

1267
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,839
reason why they're getting the hair

1268
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,000
thinning is from the caffeine use

1269
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:19,520
it's from the chocolate cacao it's from

1270
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,160
it's from the coffee it's from the

1271
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:23,200
espresso

1272
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:24,000
it's from the tea because women's

1273
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:27,200
adrenals

1274
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:29,200
have a hormone in that in that in that

1275
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:30,640
whole pocket of adrenaline in there how

1276
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:32,079
there's a special hormone that keeps

1277
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:34,400
hair on women's heads

1278
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:36,160
it's different than men women's health

1279
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,720
and men's health entirely two different

1280
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:39,119
things

1281
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:40,000
entirely two different things and no one

1282
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:42,160
thinks about that

1283
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:44,160
no one knows about that so it's like

1284
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:45,839
okay hey let's make sure we do all the

1285
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:47,359
caffeine we want to do but when your

1286
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:48,319
hair's thinning and falling out and

1287
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:50,720
you're getting all the

1288
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:52,160
patches and everything else and your

1289
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:54,560
hair is thinning and it's falling out in

1290
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:56,000
your hands and it's on the shower floor

1291
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:57,920
and no one's telling you it's from the

1292
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,040
five years of caffeine the seven years

1293
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:00,880
of caffeine

1294
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:02,640
20 years of caffeine two years of

1295
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:04,240
caffeine no one's telling it

1296
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:05,680
and that's a whole other thing all on

1297
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:07,520
its own so it's one of the biggest

1298
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:09,920
contributors to women's hair thinning

1299
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:11,680
and hair loss is caffeine

1300
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:13,359
anyway why am i even talking about all

1301
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:14,720
this because i want you to be able to

1302
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:16,400
counter it because i'm not going to be

1303
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:17,839
able to get you off your caffeine

1304
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,960
i know that i'm probably not going to be

1305
00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:20,560
able to get you off of him and some

1306
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:22,480
people i'll get him off of it

1307
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:24,160
but doesn't mean i'll be able to get you

1308
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,680
off with cacao does it mean i'll get you

1309
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:27,839
off of chocolate i mean what do i have

1310
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:30,000
to gain just eat it all you want right

1311
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:31,760
like what do i have to gain if you're

1312
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,440
jacked up on coffee every day and your

1313
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:34,880
adrenals are pumping and flooding and

1314
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:36,240
it's burning out your neurotransmitters

1315
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:37,839
like why should i care

1316
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:39,920
you could drink all the coffee you want

1317
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:41,359
all the tea you want all the espresso

1318
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:44,079
all the chocolate you want

1319
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:44,640
but i do care that's that's the problem

1320
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:46,640
i guess

1321
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:48,240
i actually do care so i want you to be

1322
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,800
able to counter it strawberry banana

1323
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:50,560
salad

1324
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:52,720
helps counter because i may not be able

1325
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:55,839
to get you off your caffeine

1326
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:57,839
but you can get the new addition

1341
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:28,000

1345
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:37,680
lemon water okay

1346
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:39,520
16 to 32 ounces first thing in the

1347
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:42,880
morning flushes your liver

1348
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:44,480
and flushes toxins out of your body and

1349
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:46,480
no one knew that they just thought lemon

1350
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:47,359
water was good for you that was it no

1351
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:50,000
one knew

1352
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:50,480
it flushed out your liver in the morning

1353
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,640
and

1354
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:54,560
but no one wants to cite that back

1355
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:56,160
that's 30 years of hard work but it

1356
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:58,960
doesn't matter it's about you guys

1357
00:46:56,160 --> 00:47:00,079
getting your healing but you know what

1358
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:02,160
does matter

1359
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:04,000
when information's not cited back then

1360
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:05,599
someone can't find their way

1361
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,200
and figure out how to heal themselves

1362
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:09,280
from lyme disease

1363
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:10,720
no one can find their way to how to heal

1364
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:14,880
themselves from m e

1365
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:15,520
c f s lupus r a hashimoto's so i guess

1366
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:18,880
it really

1367
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:22,559
it does matter so you guys

1368
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:24,160
strawberry banana salad right here so

1369
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:26,240
what happens if people don't cite it

1370
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:27,680
back then people don't know where to go

1371
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:30,800
to heal

1372
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:32,000
and it keeps others from healing and

1373
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,839
that's on

1374
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,359
those people man the people that won't

1375
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:38,160

1376
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:39,200
you want people to stay sick it's not

1377
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:41,839
fair

1378
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:42,559
um heavy metal detox smoothie i just saw

1379
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:43,839
that yeah

1380
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:46,000
you guys if you're doing a heavy metal

1381
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:49,359
detox smoothie don't just

1382
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:51,200
use any old spirulina any old barley

1383
00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:52,079
grass i'll give you a couple of tips you

1384
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:54,720
don't want to use

1385
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:57,440
barley grass you're not going to get the

1386
00:47:54,720 --> 00:48:00,079
metals out so you want barley grass

1387
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:01,440
juice powder that's the difference keep

1388
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:03,280
that in mind okay

1389
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:05,599
so that's the vimergy barley grass juice

1390
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:08,800
powder i'm not sponsored

1391
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:09,839
i don't own the company um but the

1392
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:11,520
stuff's that good

1393
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:13,280
it's what i take every day so i had my

1394
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:14,960
heavy metal detox movie this morning i

1395
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:18,000
used the vimergy barley grass

1396
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:20,000
juice powder seed juice powder

1397
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,599
and that's the best one vimergi visa and

1398
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,800
victor i m e r g

1399
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:26,480
y bimrg.com but that's

1400
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:28,480
what here the reason why i'm saying this

1401
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:30,079
is i saw the heavy metal detox smoothie

1402
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:31,839
someone say something about it and what

1403
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:33,599
people do is they use barley grass

1404
00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:34,880
guess what the metals don't come out

1405
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:37,520
people don't get better

1406
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:38,400
because the mistake was made the details

1407
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:41,200
matter

1408
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:41,599
they matter same thing with spirulina

1409
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:44,480
like

1410
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:46,000
not all spirulinas are equal that's the

1411
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:48,160
one from vimergy that's the one that

1412
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:51,200
works in the heavy metal detox smoothie

1413
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:52,960
um details matter bottom line just

1414
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:54,880
letting you guys know

1415
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:56,319
so anyway when it comes down to taking

1416
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:59,440
care of yourself

1417
00:48:56,319 --> 00:49:00,880
okay i basically want i was talking to

1418
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:03,599
this doctor the other day he said

1419
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:06,000
anthony i can't get everybody off

1420
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:06,960
the coffee i can't get everybody to stop

1421
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,240
eating chocolate

1422
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:10,000
they think the chocolate's good for them

1423
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:10,880
because they're told that it's good for

1424
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,760
you right

1425
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:15,200
he says i can't stop him so what do i do

1426
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:18,160
i said counter it man

1427
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:18,880
you got to counter it you can't stop

1428
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:20,559
people

1429
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:22,800
from hurting themselves because they've

1430
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:25,760
been brainwashed and they've been

1431
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:27,359
trained to hurt themselves so you can't

1432
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:31,119
you can't easily stop it

1433
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:33,359
right but maybe you can counter it

1434
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:34,319
is what you can do so i told this doctor

1435
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:36,079

00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:37,440

1437
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:39,760

1438
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:42,079
when i do the live get them on the foods

1439
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:44,960
