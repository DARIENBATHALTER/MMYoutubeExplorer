[352.64 - 357.04] differently all the years have been in
[354.80 - 359.84] the industry all the people I've talked
[357.04 - 361.92] to that have had transplants you name it
[359.84 - 363.52] including doctors including surgeons

[367.24 - 371.16] all of this I'm just going to be
[369.36 - 373.08] straightforward and tell you right here
[371.16 - 376.36] okay that I've heard this over and over
[373.08 - 378.60] again I've seen it the people change
[376.36 - 381.60] with a new liver not a new liver but

[405.44 - 409.44] dreams and different
[407.24 - 411.08] aspirations that is what I'm talking
[409.44 - 412.96] about and I'm not even talking about
[411.08 - 415.68] this with transplants I'm not just dis
[412.96 - 418.72] mentioning that this is an
[415.68 - 420.68] example of emotional liver and how our
[418.72 - 423.68] livers become emotional are you
[420.68 - 425.36] interested I'm interested I am I want to
[423.68 - 427.12] cover this topic I do a section in the
[425.36 - 428.84] book over it not a big section in the
[427.12 - 431.24] book but there's a there's a chapter
[428.84 - 433.16] called the emotional liver in the book
[431.24 - 437.20] and it's a big deal absolutely the book
[433.16 - 440.48] is so big it's so big I can't even I
[437.20 - 442.44] can't even I mean even though it killed
[440.48 - 445.84] me to write it it just killed me to
[442.44 - 448.04] write it it's 200,000 words basically
[445.84 - 449.92] it's a massive manuscript it's a it's
[448.04 - 451.68] it's a big book it's a thick book and
[449.92 - 453.92] it's a lot to read and it covers so many
[451.68 - 457.36] illnesses it's unbelievable but the
[453.92 - 459.36] point is is I needed room in this book
[457.36 - 461.04] for the emotional liver and it's in here
[459.36 - 463.00] so I'm going to talk about it that's
[461.04 - 465.52] what I'm going to do so that's where
[463.00 - 467.68] we're heading that's where uh we're
[465.52 - 469.60] heading next that's the deal that's the
[467.68 - 471.40] deal fasten your seat belts you might be
[469.60 - 475.40] surprised like usual on the medical
[471.40 - 477.88] medium radio show the liver's
[475.40 - 480.76] unhappiness is the foundation of her em
[477.88 - 482.16] emotional instability
[480.76 - 485.08] the liver's
[482.16 - 487.28] unhappiness is the foundation of our
[485.08 - 490.20] emotional
[487.28 - 493.28] instability just so you know I'm just
[490.20 - 497.28] being straight up it's important to
[493.28 - 499.88] know anxiety and depression can come on
[497.28 - 502.04] when the liver gets viral just when the
[499.88 - 503.60] liver gets viral if that's a new term to
[502.04 - 504.96] you new understanding just know just so
[503.60 - 507.16] you know everybody has viruses and
[504.96 - 509.92] bacteria inside of the liver everybody
[507.16 - 512.28] does I don't care who it is if you ever
[509.92 - 514.52] had a cold sore before that virus that's
[512.28 - 515.84] a simplex one it sits inside the liver
[514.52 - 519.32] it sits inside the
[515.84 - 521.64] liver that's just one example that's
[519.32 - 523.00] just one example if you ever had Mono
[521.64 - 524.32] before it's in the liver it's been in
[523.00 - 526.88] the liver your whole
[524.32 - 527.80] life didn't know you had Mono no you
[526.88 - 529.52] probably didn't know you probably had a
[527.80 - 532.56] sore throat in college for a week and
[529.52 - 535.00] slept it off that was mono and it sits
[532.56 - 536.52] inside the liver you know it's it's it's
[535.00 - 538.96] amazing it's like the liver it gets
[536.52 - 540.56] filled with viruses bacteria and then
[538.96 - 542.20] there these viruses end up later on
[540.56 - 543.32] causing Hashimoto thyroiditis causing
[542.20 - 544.60] all these problems and you can protect
[543.32 - 547.52] yourself just learn how to heal get
[544.60 - 548.88] thyroid healing learn how to heal get
[547.52 - 550.20] medical medium book one learn how to
[548.88 - 553.08] heal make sure you protect yourself from
[550.20 - 554.96] lime disease and everything else but the
[553.08 - 557.96] liver gets filled with
[554.96 - 558.96] viruses and these viruses start
[557.96 - 561.88] releasing
[558.96 - 562.92] neurotoxins because they eat food
[561.88 - 566.56] viruses
[562.92 - 569.68] feed they feed on food Foods they like
[566.56 - 571.44] making you want eggs making you want
[569.68 - 573.48] something to eat
[571.44 - 575.20] cheese because that's what these viruses
[573.48 - 576.72] feed off of them nobody in the industry
[575.20 - 578.64] knows that by the way and if you heard
[576.72 - 580.88] it somewhere it came from me first from
[578.64 - 582.72] the books and everything nobody knows
[580.88 - 584.68] that nobody knows that and it's
[582.72 - 586.20] important to know that because you need
[584.68 - 588.32] to know that because you're becoming
[586.20 - 590.16] that expert right now so you just need
[588.32 - 592.12] to know you're becoming an expert on
[590.16 - 594.60] information that's Advanced that's how
[592.12 - 597.16] it has to work if you're going to help
[594.60 - 599.80] somebody become an expert like you guys
[597.16 - 601.64] you got to at least know the
[599.80 - 603.00] how advanced the information is so you
[601.64 - 605.16] don't think it's just sitting out there
[603.00 - 607.12] somewhere when you're telling somebody
[605.16 - 609.20] and then if you hear it out there you
[607.12 - 610.76] got to hear it straight and right or
[609.20 - 612.36] you'll know that it's been skewed or
[610.76 - 614.20] thrown off and that happens all the time
[612.36 - 617.48] so always keep an eye out for
[614.20 - 619.56] that so anxiety and depression that can
[617.48 - 620.84] come on you know but that that can come
[619.56 - 622.92] on and have everything to do with the
[620.84 - 626.56] liver liver starts
[622.92 - 628.28] releasing neurotoxins too because the
[626.56 - 629.68] liver gets so filled up with neurotoxins
[628.28 - 631.24] and dermatoxin
[629.68 - 633.88] like for instance exam and psoriasis is
[631.24 - 636.32] dermat toxins that's bugs in the liver
[633.88 - 638.52] feeding off of copper and other toxins
[636.32 - 642.64] DDT that's been in there you don't think
[638.52 - 645.84] DDT is in us every eagle has DDT in it
[642.64 - 647.16] right now every Eagle does what does an
[645.84 - 651.44] eagle
[647.16 - 655.04] eat um rodents
[651.44 - 656.48] rabbits anything eagles eat chickens you
[655.04 - 660.40] know they just fly right down in a c
[656.48 - 663.52] grab a chicken fish they eat fish they
[660.40 - 666.08] scavenge Eagles are like they scavenge
[663.52 - 668.12] but why do eagles still have DDT why do
[666.08 - 671.36] they still have
[668.12 - 675.92] DDT in them there's not an eagle that
[671.36 - 678.36] doesn't have DDT in it no there isn't
[675.92 - 681.08] there's not a human that doesn't have
[678.36 - 684.52] DDT in it in
[681.08 - 686.52] them and that DDT sits inside the liver
[684.52 - 687.96] gets passed on a generation passed on a
[686.52 - 690.04] generation it's floating in the air
[687.96 - 692.00] other countries are using
[690.04 - 693.76] we're still selling it DDT companies are
[692.00 - 696.32] still selling it just as if everything's
[693.76 - 698.12] perfectly fine it's just you know when
[696.32 - 699.76] it's floating around in every other
[698.12 - 702.24] country
[699.76 - 703.64] basically still in our country it's
[702.24 - 707.04] everywhere it's in the
[703.64 - 709.56] dirt it's unbelievable it's in houses
[707.04 - 712.24] it's in the walls of houses it's
[709.56 - 715.08] unbelievable I mean my
[712.24 - 716.56] God anyway you know liver gets filled
[715.08 - 718.40] with that pesticides everything else
[716.56 - 721.48] gets it gets overloaded these things
[718.40 - 724.92] feed V viruses prescription
[721.48 - 727.08] drugs I mean everything antibiotics they
[724.92 - 728.56] start releasing oxidized Metals so that
[727.08 - 730.52] you know because antibiotics are filled
[728.56 - 733.24] with metals are filled with petroleum
[730.52 - 735.40] fills up the liver and all this stuff
[733.24 - 737.16] goes to the brain short circuits the
[735.40 - 738.60] brain short circuits neurotransmitter
[737.16 - 740.60] activity can get somebody kind of
[738.60 - 742.76] emotional even if it's not considered
[740.60 - 744.84] depression even if it's not considered
[742.76 - 747.44] anxiety just anxiousness even if it's
[744.84 - 749.80] not considered your a diagnosis of
[747.44 - 753.44] depression it's
[749.80 - 754.84] still it's still causing problems goes
[753.44 - 756.56] up to the brain can even cause
[754.84 - 758.08] neurological issues these things I talk
[756.56 - 759.88] about that in thyroid healing of course
[758.08 - 763.80] and in Liver
[759.88 - 765.92] Rescue so the emotions that even go with
[763.80 - 769.36] seasonal effectivess disorder they go
[765.92 - 771.52] with anything forget SE seasonal effect
[769.36 - 774.96] disorder just your daily disorder like
[771.52 - 778.04] your daily being affected by it becomes
[774.96 - 780.04] you know disorder emotions are like that
[778.04 - 783.00] emotions that go I mean we all have
[780.04 - 785.44] emotions it it basically anger
[783.00 - 787.52] frustration abandonment feeling crushed
[785.44 - 789.48] forgotten or the like have to do with
[787.52 - 791.76] your brain being affected by the true
[789.48 - 793.96] story of what's occurring inside of your
[791.76 - 795.48] liver and then if you have things that
[793.96 - 796.52] happen on the outside of you it's like
[795.48 - 798.16] somebody breaking your heart
[796.52 - 799.72] relationships somebody stiffing you
[798.16 - 802.00] somebody backstabbing you somebody
[799.72 - 803.48] betraying you broken trust all this
[802.00 - 805.88] stuff if you live on planet Earth long
[803.48 - 807.88] enough you'll experience some of that
[805.88 - 810.12] you'll experience some of that
[807.88 - 812.76] absolutely
[810.12 - 814.96] basically totally getting bleeped over
[812.76 - 817.56] you know that happens to so many people
[814.96 - 819.16] in so many ways and so that's not good
[817.56 - 820.72] either and that that causes trouble too
[819.16 - 822.44] because what that does is that causes
[820.72 - 823.48] adrenaline surges and that's a whole
[822.44 - 825.60] another section that we're going to go
[823.48 - 828.76] into on the emotional liver adrenaline
[825.60 - 831.08] surges surges from outside
[828.76 - 832.88] sources adrenaline surges from you're
[831.08 - 834.88] not going to hear this anywhere this
[832.88 - 837.56] just not I have to repeat that in case
[834.88 - 840.40] somebody new popped on to the podcast
[837.56 - 842.92] out of nowhere and there you know you're
[840.40 - 845.88] not going to hear any of this anywhere
[842.92 - 848.12] adrenaline surges from being crushed
[845.88 - 850.64] emotionally or being just
[848.12 - 853.00] confrontational IED is that a word no
[850.64 - 855.00] it's not a word that's not a word I just
[853.00 - 856.96] made that word up
[855.00 - 859.40] confrontation being you know pushed
[856.96 - 861.48] around anything at work co-workers
[859.40 - 863.08] friends anything going on any kind of up
[861.48 - 865.16] and down that you have in your life any
[863.08 - 867.40] kind of difficult situation that we all
[865.16 - 868.80] face day in and day out or through life
[867.40 - 871.00] or once a year or whatever it is
[868.80 - 872.92] adrenaline gets released saturates the
[871.00 - 875.08] liver injures the liver go the
[872.92 - 876.72] adrenaline goes to the brain but it
[875.08 - 878.60] definitely goes to the liver because the
[876.72 - 880.04] liver has to absorb it up to stop it
[878.60 - 881.68] from going to the heart and the Brain
[880.04 - 885.16] the best it can but some gets there
[881.68 - 889.16] anyway but the point is the liver is the
[885.16 - 892.20] mop the sponge for adrenaline
[889.16 - 894.48] related you know issues from outside
[892.20 - 897.68] sources of being let down and so forth
[894.48 - 899.52] and challenged and everything else
[897.68 - 901.08] adrenaline
[899.52 - 904.80] is an
[901.08 - 907.84] issue it's very difficult so that's just
[904.80 - 911.20] one thing that's just one thing and then
[907.84 - 913.80] our own emotions that occur from a toxic
[911.20 - 915.68] liver like I said anger frustration
[913.80 - 918.00] abandonment you know that feeling of
[915.68 - 921.04] being crushed forgotten or the like
[918.00 - 923.64] having to do with everything being
[921.04 - 926.00] affected by what's in occurring inside
[923.64 - 929.08] the liver the liver's unhappiness is the
[926.00 - 931.00] foundation of our emotional stability
[929.08 - 933.44] I'm going to say it over again I'm going
[931.00 - 936.48] to say it over again you
[933.44 - 938.40] guys very important to know and then you
[936.48 - 941.16] got Mercury inside the liver pathogens
[938.40 - 943.68] feeding off of mercury creating more
[941.16 - 945.28] toxins and these toxins being released
[943.68 - 947.12] out of the liver and the liver holds as
[945.28 - 949.32] many as it can until it gets sluggish
[947.12 - 952.48] and stagnant and becomes
[949.32 - 955.28] weak and that's the whole thing there
[952.48 - 956.72] too electrical electrical impulses in
[955.28 - 959.04] the brain can short circuit from all
[956.72 - 960.76] these toxins that come from the liver
[959.04 - 962.64] creating more emotional issues and
[960.76 - 964.36] frustration and anger can arise from a
[962.64 - 965.60] sluggish pref fatty or fatty liver so
[964.36 - 967.56] basically your
[965.60 - 969.68] liver is what I'm trying to say is your
[967.56 - 973.80] liver getting fatty or pre fatty
[969.68 - 978.36] emotions come from that they arise from
[973.80 - 982.60] that they do and it's a difficult
[978.36 - 987.40] situation the liver starts to lose its
[982.60 - 989.68] strength as it's fighting for its life
[987.40 - 993.16] on a daily basis
[989.68 - 996.04] our livers fight for its own life on a
[993.16 - 998.36] daily basis so what do we do we throw a
[996.04 - 1001.44] whole bunch of crappy food in there we
[998.36 - 1002.96] do we do all kinds of stuff I got people
[1001.44 - 1004.60] complaining about celery juice they
[1002.96 - 1006.72] can't drink celery juice 50-year-olds
[1004.60 - 1009.00] can't drink celery juice they don't want
[1006.72 - 1011.96] to drink it and they got babies on
[1009.00 - 1015.20] Instagram toddlers drinking glasses of
[1011.96 - 1019.44] celery juice is not complaining one bit
[1015.20 - 1021.52] got 40y olds 25 year olds 30-y olds 28y
[1019.44 - 1023.48] olds can't can't get any celery juice
[1021.52 - 1024.72] down they feel like they're bloating or
[1023.48 - 1026.68] they got something going on they just
[1024.72 - 1028.64] don't like it because first of all it's
[1026.68 - 1030.44] it's gets becomes
[1028.64 - 1032.64] emotional
[1030.44 - 1034.52] emotional it becomes emotional because
[1032.64 - 1036.56] you're actually hitting the liver with
[1034.52 - 1037.96] all that and you're cleansing the liver
[1036.56 - 1040.32] it's yeah it could be
[1037.96 - 1042.56] hard as you got these babies and are
[1040.32 - 1045.80] just drinking down a big glass of celery
[1042.56 - 1047.80] juice I swear to God it just blows me
[1045.80 - 1049.48] off my seat and that's happening
[1047.80 - 1051.36] worldwide it's happening around the
[1049.48 - 1055.12] country and everything
[1051.36 - 1057.12] else it's it's really funny it's funny
[1055.12 - 1058.60] how things work I mean it's the best
[1057.12 - 1060.96] thing I've ever seen you know I would
[1058.60 - 1064.00] have never dreamed that I had over the
[1060.96 - 1065.40] years um I've had moms give celery juice
[1064.00 - 1068.12] their little ones over the years when I
[1065.40 - 1070.84] was in practice you know year year after
[1068.12 - 1071.92] year seven days a week all day sometimes
[1070.84 - 1075.80] throughout the night depending on
[1071.92 - 1077.60] emergencies and stuff like that and um
[1075.80 - 1079.28] and um there's a lot of little kids and
[1077.60 - 1082.16] a lot of kids that that drank celery
[1079.28 - 1084.32] juice but when but that's before that
[1082.16 - 1086.40] was before you can see it happening like
[1084.32 - 1089.32] on the internet now you can see it so
[1086.40 - 1092.24] when I see it it just blows me away it
[1089.32 - 1093.88] blew me away a long time ago and it
[1092.24 - 1095.52] blows me away still
[1093.88 - 1097.04] today
[1095.52 - 1100.24] so
[1097.04 - 1102.88] anyway the liver can become
[1100.24 - 1106.16] cranky on its
[1102.88 - 1108.64] own and it can even feel disconnected on
[1106.16 - 1110.76] its own it's not getting any love any
[1108.64 - 1113.56] attention we really do abuse our livers
[1110.76 - 1116.64] not because we want to I know you don't
[1113.56 - 1118.32] want to I don't want to we don't want to
[1116.64 - 1120.84] it happens from misinformation and
[1118.32 - 1122.48] disinformation and everything else it
[1120.84 - 1124.60] happens from a lot of that trendy stuff
[1122.48 - 1127.24] too cleanses that are actually bad for
[1124.60 - 1129.08] the liver cleans is just terrible
[1127.24 - 1130.44] cleanse it's not like the 369 in Liver
[1129.08 - 1133.88] Rescue you want to cleanse your liver
[1130.44 - 1136.84] safely and learn why it's safe so you
[1133.88 - 1139.00] actually know get get the Liver Rescue
[1136.84 - 1141.68] book but
[1139.00 - 1143.36] trendy misinformation out there the
[1141.68 - 1145.28] disinformation is just horrendous
[1143.36 - 1146.92] because it gets people in trouble you
[1145.28 - 1148.12] eat a lot more fat you don't even know
[1146.92 - 1149.32] you're eating all this protein fat
[1148.12 - 1151.68] you're just killing your liver you're
[1149.32 - 1152.96] aging yourself quickly sure might not
[1151.68 - 1154.56] see it when you're exercising and
[1152.96 - 1155.80] feeling pretty good at 25 years old and
[1154.56 - 1158.36] you're trying to lower your carbs and
[1155.80 - 1160.80] you're trying to stay off fast food sure
[1158.36 - 1163.48] fine but everybody gets older you can't
[1160.80 - 1166.20] escape it and and it's all catches up
[1163.48 - 1167.80] the liver gets toxic bugs collect in it
[1166.20 - 1169.76] you know relationships and all kinds of
[1167.80 - 1171.88] things through life and bugs collect
[1169.76 - 1173.12] that go into the liver whatever happens
[1171.88 - 1174.68] you're eating in restaurants all the
[1173.12 - 1176.12] time and whatever and you you can pick
[1174.68 - 1178.40] up bugs and just what happens is the
[1176.12 - 1179.76] liver gets filled up it's gets weak you
[1178.40 - 1181.48] start getting bloated you get the hot
[1179.76 - 1182.72] flashes you get the viral symptoms
[1181.48 - 1184.48] everything else that everybody has the
[1182.72 - 1185.88] type of thyroid that comes on later on
[1184.48 - 1187.56] all these things you can't escape it
[1185.88 - 1188.84] unless you do the right things and you
[1187.56 - 1190.96] watch what you're
[1188.84 - 1192.36] doing and you know what you're doing
[1190.96 - 1194.28] that's the whole point so medical medium
[1192.36 - 1197.04] series is teaching anybody that so they
[1194.28 - 1200.04] can actually stay healthy and
[1197.04 - 1202.24] young but the liver gets tired from
[1200.04 - 1206.60] everything and it gets
[1202.24 - 1208.92] emotional it actually gets
[1206.60 - 1210.84] emotional and it's a really important
[1208.92 - 1213.52] thing to
[1210.84 - 1215.80] understand and we have to treat it with
[1213.52 - 1215.80] some
[1215.92 - 1220.80] respect when the liver gets toxic and
[1218.40 - 1224.32] it's holding on to tremendous amounts of
[1220.80 - 1227.48] poisons such as get this
[1224.32 - 1228.88] radiation oh man the liver holds on to
[1227.48 - 1230.56] radiation
[1228.88 - 1233.96] trying to protect you number one plus we
[1230.56 - 1236.64] get radiation exposure a lot pesticides
[1233.96 - 1238.44] herbicides nanotechnology where can we
[1236.64 - 1239.16] get nanotechnology it's coming out of
[1238.44 - 1241.64] the
[1239.16 - 1243.48] sky and I'm not trying to like claim
[1241.64 - 1245.00] doomsday I'm just saying we just need to
[1243.48 - 1247.40] cleanse our livers properly take care of
[1245.00 - 1249.24] ourselves eat the right things and get
[1247.40 - 1250.64] rid of our you know symptoms conditions
[1249.24 - 1252.28] and learn how to protect ourselves and
[1250.64 - 1253.96] learn how to you know help the emotional
[1252.28 - 1255.72] liver so we don't become emotional I
[1253.96 - 1258.76] mean all of this is this
[1255.72 - 1260.28] important is it important I thought it
[1258.76 - 1262.00] was really important I put it in the
[1260.28 - 1263.48] book it's a little section in the book I
[1262.00 - 1266.20] mean the book is so big it's got so many
[1263.48 - 1267.56] other things in there to talk about but
[1266.20 - 1270.12] I put this in
[1267.56 - 1272.96] there you know spirit said to me we need
[1270.12 - 1275.72] this I said all right okay all right
[1272.96 - 1278.28] well then I said fine I mean I could
[1275.72 - 1279.96] have said no but I said all right and I
[1278.28 - 1282.28] get it we really really do need it you
[1279.96 - 1284.04] know I I have to learn too when the
[1282.28 - 1285.80] liver gets toxic and it's holding on to
[1284.04 - 1288.12] a tremendous amount of poison such as
[1285.80 - 1289.92] radiation pesticides herbicides nanot
[1288.12 - 1291.76] technology materials that are on
[1289.92 - 1293.92] clothing brand new clothing you name it
[1291.76 - 1297.44] fungicides that are on
[1293.92 - 1299.68] everything toxic heavy metals what's a
[1297.44 - 1302.24] toxic heavy metal mercury lead arsenic
[1299.68 - 1305.88] copper nickel
[1302.24 - 1309.60] chromium Chrome whatever
[1305.88 - 1312.36] anything the whole bit I said nickel
[1309.60 - 1313.20] barium whatever um a whole bunch of
[1312.36 - 1316.52] different
[1313.20 - 1318.72] things you know bacteria viruses path
[1316.52 - 1320.84] pathogenic waste matter like dermato
[1318.72 - 1322.24] toxins like I said neurotoxins some of
[1320.84 - 1324.36] these poisons can leech into the
[1322.24 - 1325.96] bloodstream and intestinal tract as
[1324.36 - 1329.68] you've read
[1325.96 - 1331.32] before in thyroid healing and medical
[1329.68 - 1334.08] medium book
[1331.32 - 1336.20] one they can cause some of the issues
[1334.08 - 1337.92] we've like looked at with everything I
[1336.20 - 1341.52] talked about that before
[1337.92 - 1342.80] adrenaline though is a really obnoxious
[1341.52 - 1345.88] annoying
[1342.80 - 1346.96] one because adrenaline get this get this
[1345.88 - 1349.96] you
[1346.96 - 1349.96] guys
[1350.24 - 1356.56] adrenaline is released when we go
[1353.84 - 1356.56] through a hard
[1356.76 - 1362.32] time it's released with regular things
[1359.76 - 1363.84] too or a good time but it's released
[1362.32 - 1368.88] with hard
[1363.84 - 1372.44] times it is when it's released with hard
[1368.88 - 1375.16] times it has information in it
[1372.44 - 1378.80] information stored in it because there's
[1375.16 - 1382.16] over 56 blends of a adrenaline science
[1378.80 - 1385.44] and research has no idea 56 Blends the
[1382.16 - 1387.16] adrenal subtle Blends from being like
[1385.44 - 1388.60] going through a hardship or a breakup or
[1387.16 - 1391.04] whatever it is whatever it is whatever
[1388.60 - 1394.64] hard time it is a
[1391.04 - 1398.36] loss and that adrenaline has information
[1394.64 - 1400.40] in it released at the time when a
[1398.36 - 1403.28] certain time happened in your
[1400.40 - 1404.24] life the liver Sops it all up absorbs it
[1403.28 - 1409.88] all
[1404.24 - 1409.88] up and takes on that information
[1410.32 - 1413.68] and that that can build up over time if
[1412.24 - 1414.52] a lot of stuff is intense and going
[1413.68 - 1416.64] through your life and you're not
[1414.52 - 1418.24] cleansing and take care in your liver
[1416.64 - 1420.40] that's one of the things also adrenaline
[1418.24 - 1421.72] scorches and weakens the liver but the
[1420.40 - 1423.08] liver is doing that to protect your
[1421.72 - 1425.20] brain your heart the whole bit the liver
[1423.08 - 1426.64] is trying to protect your butt that's
[1425.20 - 1429.32] trying to protect
[1426.64 - 1431.92] you mind-blowing isn't it mind-blowing
[1429.32 - 1436.00] information that's in Liver Rescue mind
[1431.92 - 1436.00] blow it blows my mind it blew my
[1436.20 - 1442.72] mind fasten your seat seat belts got
[1438.72 - 1444.20] more to come it's really intense gets
[1442.72 - 1446.84] actually pretty
[1444.20 - 1448.52] crazy when that adrenaline gets trapped
[1446.84 - 1450.16] in the liver the liver tries to trap it
[1448.52 - 1452.44] in fat
[1450.16 - 1454.44] cells yeah and when your liver gets
[1452.44 - 1456.76] sluggish and lazy and it's been through
[1454.44 - 1458.68] hell and you're eating high fat diets or
[1456.76 - 1461.32] anything else the liver starts taking on
[1458.68 - 1463.24] more fat adrenaline gets set not only
[1461.32 - 1466.80] saturated in liver tissue can get
[1463.24 - 1468.40] saturated in liver liver fat
[1466.80 - 1470.08] cells
[1468.40 - 1472.12] whether it's in liver fat cells or just
[1470.08 - 1474.20] living liver tissue that adrenaline that
[1472.12 - 1477.04] happened during a hard time or a loss or
[1474.20 - 1479.68] a breakup or a divorce or a problem or a
[1477.04 - 1482.32] stressful time in your
[1479.68 - 1485.52] life when it needs to be released
[1482.32 - 1487.88] because the liver decides to release
[1485.52 - 1490.40] it you know like when you know breakups
[1487.88 - 1492.28] betrayals being stabbed in the back this
[1490.40 - 1493.40] information's in that adrenaline and
[1492.28 - 1496.16] when it gets
[1493.40 - 1499.40] released it goes through the
[1496.16 - 1501.60] body and creates it's emotions that are
[1499.40 - 1504.60] unexplainable you can't really tap into
[1501.60 - 1506.60] it or touch it but it's there can get
[1504.60 - 1509.00] somebody down depressed sad at the end
[1506.60 - 1512.96] of the day without even realizing
[1509.00 - 1515.52] it it's powerful stuff that
[1512.96 - 1519.00] happens your liver wants to prevent you
[1515.52 - 1520.64] from becoming Intoxicated by adrenaline
[1519.00 - 1522.96] this is a steroid that races through
[1520.64 - 1524.44] your bloodstream messes you up and
[1522.96 - 1527.52] during these traumatic moments your
[1524.44 - 1529.08] liver becomes so nervous and even scared
[1527.52 - 1531.76] for your
[1529.08 - 1536.04] life and get ready for
[1531.76 - 1538.40] this it releases a hormone undiscovered
[1536.04 - 1540.12] by research and science they'll Discover
[1538.40 - 1541.68] it maybe in 50 years or 40 years
[1540.12 - 1543.80] whatever it is I don't even know if I'm
[1541.68 - 1545.12] if we're even lucky if I'm even lucky
[1543.80 - 1547.88] they've already discovered some things
[1545.12 - 1547.88] that I put out years
[1548.00 - 1552.28] ago yeah heard it here first though
[1550.72 - 1555.28] Discovery was here
[1552.28 - 1557.32] first your liver becomes so nervous and
[1555.28 - 1559.16] even scared for your life it releases a
[1557.32 - 1562.12] hormone that's undiscovered like I said
[1559.16 - 1566.20] by science and research that draws
[1562.12 - 1568.76] excess adrenaline into the liver so the
[1566.20 - 1572.12] organ can sop it up to protect you from
[1568.76 - 1574.84] stroking out from neurotransmitters
[1572.12 - 1577.64] being totally burned out from the
[1574.84 - 1579.08] experience and even from Hemorrhage or
[1577.64 - 1582.36] anything of the
[1579.08 - 1585.16] sort the liver can soak up excess
[1582.36 - 1587.04] adrenaline from the bloodstream during
[1585.16 - 1589.24] bouns of intense stress and other
[1587.04 - 1591.84] adrenal
[1589.24 - 1595.04] triggers it's only a temporary solution
[1591.84 - 1597.16] but still the liver is doing this over
[1595.04 - 1599.88] time it must release its adrenaline
[1597.16 - 1602.04] stores bit by bit because it has no
[1599.88 - 1603.84] choice and even when you're cleansing
[1602.04 - 1605.40] it'll release it which will make you
[1603.84 - 1608.20] feel weird during your cleansing and
[1605.40 - 1610.04] detoxing totally emotional can make you
[1608.20 - 1611.36] feel really emotionally unstable when
[1610.04 - 1613.56] you detox but people do different
[1611.36 - 1615.52] cleanses and detoxes and water fasts and
[1613.56 - 1617.00] whatever and Juice fasts they get
[1615.52 - 1618.72] emotional because this is the stuff
[1617.00 - 1620.44] that's coming out but nobody knows or
[1618.72 - 1623.04] has a clue no one you're hearing it
[1620.44 - 1628.28] first ever
[1623.04 - 1628.28] here over time it releases this
[1628.56 - 1633.56] adrenaline that's right bit by bit so
[1631.56 - 1635.80] the kidneys and the intestinal tract can
[1633.56 - 1638.32] try to be prepared to release a new bat
[1635.80 - 1640.44] so you could be be prepared to get rid
[1638.32 - 1643.80] of it as each new batch is coming in
[1640.44 - 1643.80] even gets released out of your
[1644.40 - 1649.40] armpits as the adrenaline leaves you'll
[1646.80 - 1653.04] experience the information stored the
[1649.40 - 1653.04] hurt the hurt
[1653.24 - 1658.64] stored
[1654.92 - 1661.64] nostalgic almost surreal in a
[1658.64 - 1665.56] way even if the adrenaline was from a
[1661.64 - 1670.20] month ago 6 months ago a year ago 5
[1665.56 - 1672.56] years ago 10 years ago 15 years
[1670.20 - 1675.92] ago you'll feel a little bit of loss
[1672.56 - 1679.52] maybe some frustration maybe even a
[1675.92 - 1679.52] crapload of anger
[1680.92 - 1685.16] so this liver of ours tends to release
[1683.28 - 1688.12] its storage bins of
[1685.16 - 1690.32] adrenaline with even the change of the
[1688.12 - 1692.72] seasons a little spurt here a little
[1690.32 - 1694.68] spurt
[1692.72 - 1696.56] there when your liver took this
[1694.68 - 1698.20] adrenaline originally it released that
[1696.56 - 1700.40] it was released during your emotional
[1698.20 - 1703.40] trials and
[1700.40 - 1705.40] tribulations it also took on and held to
[1703.40 - 1708.52] your emotional experience that's what
[1705.40 - 1712.96] I'm trying to tell you the liver took on
[1708.52 - 1712.96] and held on to your emotional
[1714.16 - 1721.56] experience experiences too experiences
[1718.56 - 1721.56] too
[1721.68 - 1725.16] okay that's really
[1725.28 - 1730.16] important its release of this can
[1727.80 - 1732.56] trigger the same painful experience and
[1730.16 - 1733.96] feelings you had when the adrenaline was
[1732.56 - 1737.44] first
[1733.96 - 1740.00] released at a time of struggle because
[1737.44 - 1745.52] it holds this emotional
[1740.00 - 1745.52] Essence as the liver lets go you let
[1745.80 - 1752.04] go so I
[1748.12 - 1755.56] mean this is important
[1752.04 - 1758.60] information and it's important because
[1755.56 - 1761.64] you may be feeling lost when you feel
[1758.60 - 1764.32] emotional not no but the irony is you go
[1761.64 - 1767.48] to a you go to a psych and you go to
[1764.32 - 1770.96] whatever and you go to a you go to a you
[1767.48 - 1771.96] know whatever psychoanalyst psychologist
[1770.96 - 1773.92] whatever it
[1771.96 - 1776.12] is
[1773.92 - 1778.84] psychiatrist and you know I mean they
[1776.12 - 1781.80] just try their best but they won't know
[1778.84 - 1785.08] that this is happening they just don't
[1781.80 - 1786.48] so I mean it it's good that you know so
[1785.08 - 1788.28] many people feel lost and they don't
[1786.48 - 1791.00] even know why and the liver has
[1788.28 - 1794.64] everything to do with it that's the
[1791.00 - 1794.64] irony liver has everything to do with
[1795.00 - 1800.60] it so the liver keeps a
[1797.88 - 1802.68] record it's unbelievable it keeps a
[1800.60 - 1806.64] record of what's
[1802.68 - 1806.64] happening it keeps a record of
[1807.00 - 1812.08] everything and you can feel extra
[1810.28 - 1815.16] emotional as you get toward the end of a
[1812.08 - 1816.88] calendar year too just as adrenaline
[1815.16 - 1818.96] that's released on the liver schedule is
[1816.88 - 1821.76] attached to emotions liver on a schedule
[1818.96 - 1822.92] as well it's amazing how the liver works
[1821.76 - 1825.92] the
[1822.92 - 1829.00] adrenaline the adrenaline that's
[1825.92 - 1832.08] attached to toxins that the liver is
[1829.00 - 1834.56] forced to let go can bring out emotions
[1832.08 - 1837.12] too so you can have adrenaline attached
[1834.56 - 1837.12] to a
[1837.48 - 1844.28] toxin any kind of toxin inside the
[1841.40 - 1847.48] liver or you could have been at a
[1844.28 - 1852.00] funeral at one time 8 years ago you ate
[1847.48 - 1854.88] a ham sandwich to wash down your
[1852.00 - 1859.00] Sorrows all this time your brain has
[1854.88 - 1861.44] stored away the memory within its data
[1859.00 - 1864.32] database and your liver is that database
[1861.44 - 1864.32] and brain in this
[1865.12 - 1869.76] situation your liver has stored the
[1867.56 - 1873.00] emotional information along with the
[1869.76 - 1875.80] cheap hams ammonia nitrates and other
[1873.00 - 1879.32] preservatives that you ate at the
[1875.80 - 1883.04] funeral and cheap fat or unhealthy fat
[1879.32 - 1885.08] in the pork that it neutralized and took
[1883.04 - 1889.16] on to protect you so your liver absorbed
[1885.08 - 1889.16] it and took it on to protect you
[1889.72 - 1893.48] I mean this is the power of the liver
[1891.28 - 1895.72] what it does and the memory it has too
[1893.48 - 1895.72] it's
[1896.00 - 1900.40] incredible you can feel that when that
[1898.24 - 1903.36] ham sandwich starts detoxing out of your
[1900.40 - 1906.00] liver along with the adrenaline
[1903.36 - 1908.28] too you can feel that sorrow again and
[1906.00 - 1911.84] not even pinpoint where it's coming
[1908.28 - 1914.92] from not even know where the grief is
[1911.84 - 1916.84] coming from you can be consumed with
[1914.92 - 1919.08] grief for a time and not even know why
[1916.84 - 1921.76] as it traveling through your
[1919.08 - 1924.16] bloodstream that's just one of hundreds
[1921.76 - 1925.52] of examples of when that ham sand Sam
[1924.16 - 1928.44] Sandwich starts to come out of that
[1925.52 - 1930.56] liver with the experience this being at
[1928.44 - 1931.80] a funeral as an example and eating that
[1930.56 - 1934.92] ham
[1931.80 - 1938.36] sandwich our bodies are complicated but
[1934.92 - 1939.48] simple Simplicity meaning that if we
[1938.36 - 1940.60] take care of them give them what they
[1939.48 - 1942.40] need you wouldn't believe what they'll
[1940.60 - 1944.04] do for you you wouldn't believe what
[1942.40 - 1945.40] your body will do for you if you don't
[1944.04 - 1946.80] know what it needs then we get in
[1945.40 - 1947.72] trouble because if we don't know we
[1946.80 - 1950.24] don't
[1947.72 - 1952.04] know and that's the whole point of why I
[1950.24 - 1953.76] wake up in the morning it's why when I
[1952.04 - 1954.84] was age four and spirit started talking
[1953.76 - 1957.64] to
[1954.84 - 1960.16] me and I took spirit's information which
[1957.64 - 1962.16] was just as advanced when I was 5 six
[1960.16 - 1964.36] seven 8 years old as it is now it's all
[1962.16 - 1966.00] the same Spirit would still tell me the
[1964.36 - 1969.72] same didn't mean I had to understand it
[1966.00 - 1972.64] but I can still I can still recite it as
[1969.72 - 1974.92] if I was in a play in a play or
[1972.64 - 1977.76] something trying to listen to my lines
[1974.92 - 1979.64] or read my lines spirit was giving me
[1977.76 - 1981.60] the lines to say didn't matter how
[1979.64 - 1983.20] advanced it was about neurotoxins didn't
[1981.60 - 1985.00] matter how advanced it was about 60
[1983.20 - 1987.32] varieties of viruses it doesn't matter
[1985.00 - 1989.36] how advanced it was i''d be 6 Seven 8
[1987.32 - 1993.20] years old just talking just saying it
[1989.36 - 1995.60] all as organized as the liver tries to
[1993.20 - 1998.08] stay with different
[1995.60 - 1999.72] compartments and store different toxins
[1998.08 - 2001.32] in every place inside the liver because
[1999.72 - 2004.32] the liver stores so many different
[2001.32 - 2006.44] toxins in so many different areas it has
[2004.32 - 2008.36] storage Banks and it and it's B do you
[2006.44 - 2011.28] ever ever been to a
[2008.36 - 2012.60] dump and you know scrap metal and all
[2011.28 - 2014.56] this other stuff there I mean I don't
[2012.60 - 2018.28] know if you've ever been to one you know
[2014.56 - 2022.44] when I was a kid we lived near a dump
[2018.28 - 2023.92] you know it was kind of close enough and
[2022.44 - 2025.40] you know it wasn't good either because
[2023.92 - 2027.20] you got all that mercury and you got all
[2025.40 - 2029.24] that bad stuff just lead and everything
[2027.20 - 2031.64] else just leaking from rain water just
[2029.24 - 2033.28] leaking down into the Earth you know was
[2031.64 - 2038.52] always concerned being kind of living
[2033.28 - 2042.12] near that close enough but but the
[2038.52 - 2045.36] bottom line is I remember going to the
[2042.12 - 2047.20] dump and you know family would bring
[2045.36 - 2050.36] some garbage go to the dump or something
[2047.20 - 2053.20] like that and you I'd walk through and
[2050.36 - 2056.20] back then it was it's not like now you
[2053.20 - 2061.08] know as a kid literally walking through
[2056.20 - 2063.12] like a dangerous area unbelievable and
[2061.08 - 2065.24] and you can see like one pile had all
[2063.12 - 2068.28] these wash machines and
[2065.24 - 2070.36] dryers see you or something microwaves
[2068.28 - 2072.84] wash machine dryers and all that
[2070.36 - 2074.04] something like that one pile one pile
[2072.84 - 2077.28] had all these like
[2074.04 - 2078.88] bicycles you know bicycle frames and all
[2077.28 - 2082.12] this other stuff one pile had all this
[2078.88 - 2084.84] like toilets and sinks and all that you
[2082.12 - 2087.56] know you know another another had like
[2084.84 - 2090.52] bottles and crap just like it was all
[2087.56 - 2091.84] that kind of stuff oh wa and another pot
[2090.52 - 2094.64] would be like
[2091.84 - 2097.80] couches it was crazy and know probably
[2094.64 - 2098.96] would be like couches and mattresses
[2097.80 - 2102.08] yeah I don't know if you've ever
[2098.96 - 2105.92] experienced anything like
[2102.08 - 2108.36] this yeah anyway you know I'd see all
[2105.92 - 2110.76] that and I remember I'll never forget
[2108.36 - 2112.44] Spirit saying to me I was 8 years old
[2110.76 - 2115.24] and spirit said to me as I was standing
[2112.44 - 2116.84] there waiting for my dad to you know do
[2115.24 - 2120.84] his thing and drop off garbage or
[2116.84 - 2122.52] whatever it is and spirit said to me
[2120.84 - 2125.12] this is like your liver right here this
[2122.52 - 2126.92] garbage dump I said my liver personally
[2125.12 - 2128.68] Spirit Well your liver is not so bad cuz
[2126.92 - 2130.00] we've been working on it you know Spirit
[2128.68 - 2131.44] would always tell me how to eat a little
[2130.00 - 2133.88] bit better and everything else at that
[2131.44 - 2136.64] young age I do do the best at my
[2133.88 - 2139.52] capacity then whatever was
[2136.64 - 2143.52] available but spirit said no this is
[2139.52 - 2147.92] this is the human liver right here
[2143.52 - 2149.92] wow so it's like I was amazed because I
[2147.92 - 2152.12] was getting it I was starting to
[2149.92 - 2153.60] understand it more and more not just
[2152.12 - 2155.64] hearing the information to be able to
[2153.60 - 2157.60] tell somebody hey look you got you got
[2155.64 - 2159.60] this thing in your liver and you got
[2157.60 - 2161.12] these spots in your liver I see that
[2159.60 - 2164.96] spirit's telling you about and that you
[2161.12 - 2166.64] know all that and and you know and doing
[2164.96 - 2169.96] the scan and all that that Spirit taught
[2166.64 - 2172.12] me to do but it was I was sitting there
[2169.96 - 2175.32] and it was like a revelation it was
[2172.12 - 2179.52] almost like oh my God it was
[2175.32 - 2182.28] serious and what it was what it was was
[2179.52 - 2185.20] I had this realization I saw it this was
[2182.28 - 2187.64] the liver it was starting to hit me wow
[2185.20 - 2189.12] everybody's liver is polluted
[2187.64 - 2191.52] and spirit said you see that pile of
[2189.12 - 2194.32] scrap metal over there those are heavy
[2191.52 - 2197.96] metals they're all in the liver of
[2194.32 - 2200.84] somebody and the liver tries to actually
[2197.96 - 2203.08] put them in compartments even separating
[2200.84 - 2207.04] them if the liver can and it will it
[2203.08 - 2210.88] will try because it'll do everything it
[2207.04 - 2213.68] can and then spirit said you see those
[2210.88 - 2215.52] piles of cans over there cans and and
[2213.68 - 2217.48] all that and Bottles the bottle caps and
[2215.52 - 2221.36] all that
[2217.48 - 2222.88] and I said yeah all those cans and all
[2221.36 - 2225.24] those different cans and all that
[2222.88 - 2229.00] there's petrochemicals in those cans
[2225.24 - 2232.00] those are all aerosol cans and solvents
[2229.00 - 2234.52] inside of them and empty solvent cans of
[2232.00 - 2237.00] you know of of oil degreasers and
[2234.52 - 2237.92] carburetor cleaners and all these
[2237.00 - 2240.40] different
[2237.92 - 2241.72] things and those are all petrochemicals
[2240.40 - 2244.28] and solvents and they go in a different
[2241.72 - 2247.48] area of the liver a deep core of the
[2244.28 - 2250.04] liver and in that pile you see m old gas
[2247.48 - 2251.28] cans everywhere the metal ones some of
[2250.04 - 2253.32] them still having a little bit of
[2251.28 - 2257.20] gasoline at the bottom all piled up in a
[2253.32 - 2259.68] big Heap ready just to ignite if
[2257.20 - 2263.24] anything those old
[2259.68 - 2265.76] dumps and spirit would say and you see
[2263.24 - 2267.60] that pile over there and I said what and
[2265.76 - 2270.00] spirit said and that pile over there the
[2267.60 - 2272.68] furniture and the beds it's all from
[2270.00 - 2277.40] Malahide that's all you know outgassing
[2272.68 - 2279.16] materials and chemical Laden you know uh
[2277.40 - 2280.88] uh Petri chemicals too and different
[2279.16 - 2282.80] kinds of solvents different kind of
[2280.88 - 2285.68] falah hdes and everything all sitting
[2282.80 - 2288.76] there and I got it and I got it I
[2285.68 - 2291.04] understood at age eight how the liver
[2288.76 - 2293.32] works and how it stores everything and
[2291.04 - 2296.68] how it stores
[2293.32 - 2300.36] everything yeah and then spirit said
[2296.68 - 2302.84] this which blew my mind as an
[2300.36 - 2304.68] 8-year-old and I didn't forget it I
[2302.84 - 2307.16] didn't forget this
[2304.68 - 2308.60] one and spirit said
[2307.16 - 2311.00] these are all
[2308.60 - 2314.92] possessions all these things you see in
[2311.00 - 2318.04] here that are piled up bicycles the wash
[2314.92 - 2321.04] Machines Car Parts all this kind of
[2318.04 - 2324.16] stuff and they have emotions attached to
[2321.04 - 2326.24] them people attach themselves to
[2324.16 - 2328.80] possessions of course emotions are
[2326.24 - 2331.48] combined into that it might be a bicycle
[2328.80 - 2335.28] somebody first got as a gift for a first
[2331.48 - 2338.76] birthday it might be or a birthday it
[2335.28 - 2340.92] might be a couch that a husband bought a
[2338.76 - 2343.64] wife for an
[2340.92 - 2348.00] anniversary it could be
[2343.64 - 2351.32] anything in the pile that was in there
[2348.00 - 2355.68] could be wash machine a wash
[2351.32 - 2358.04] machine that you know washed a whole
[2355.68 - 2359.64] bunch of bedding from somebody that was
[2358.04 - 2363.28] that passed
[2359.64 - 2364.72] away it could be a mattress that you
[2363.28 - 2369.12] know there was good times on the
[2364.72 - 2372.52] mattress of of of a couple together
[2369.12 - 2375.68] Partners husband and wife or whatever
[2372.52 - 2378.56] and also could be bad times being sick
[2375.68 - 2382.48] spirit said and having a stroke and
[2378.56 - 2385.00] laying in the bed for a long
[2382.48 - 2386.72] time there's emotions even in all of
[2385.00 - 2389.76] this and spirit taught me then that the
[2386.72 - 2391.72] liver is filled with emotions along with
[2389.76 - 2393.72] toxins that even come from these
[2391.72 - 2396.96] possessions
[2393.72 - 2399.44] here if feel laid in a bed and there's
[2396.96 - 2401.04] some faldh coming up which you can detox
[2399.44 - 2403.52] and heal yourself from I mean it's all
[2401.04 - 2404.92] good not trying to scare anybody you can
[2403.52 - 2407.44] lay in your you lay in the bed and you
[2404.92 - 2409.96] got these toxins coming
[2407.44 - 2413.28] up and it happened during a
[2409.96 - 2414.68] time yeah it stores in the liver and it
[2413.28 - 2416.68] could get released and there could be an
[2414.68 - 2418.96] emotional connection to
[2416.68 - 2421.44] it it's that
[2418.96 - 2423.68] intense it's that unbelievable the liver
[2421.44 - 2426.64] is just an unbelievable mechanism of
[2423.68 - 2427.88] some kind unbelievable organ gland and
[2426.64 - 2429.28] whatever you want to call it whatever
[2427.88 - 2431.16] science of research wants to call it I'm
[2429.28 - 2435.68] cool with that science research thinks
[2431.16 - 2437.76] it has 500 chemical functions try again
[2435.68 - 2440.80] it's got over
[2437.76 - 2441.92] 2,000 it's got over 2,000 Spirit taught
[2440.80 - 2444.88] me that
[2441.92 - 2447.80] too did Spirit teach me all 2000 no my
[2444.88 - 2450.16] head would blow up it would just explode
[2447.80 - 2451.92] and I I can't go through that but I sure
[2450.16 - 2453.84] as heck put hundreds of undiscovered
[2451.92 - 2456.88] ones in this book live or
[2453.84 - 2459.44] rescue hundreds of U undiscovered
[2456.88 - 2463.00] chemical functions in Liver
[2459.44 - 2465.84] Rescue but the bottom line
[2463.00 - 2467.64] is is I was just completely blown away
[2465.84 - 2470.48] as I stood there at 8 years old hearing
[2467.64 - 2473.28] all this so the liver put compart has
[2470.48 - 2474.80] compartments of these stored poisons of
[2473.28 - 2477.16] all these different stored things that
[2474.80 - 2478.88] we go through and memories and things
[2477.16 - 2483.20] and bad and good and everything else
[2478.88 - 2485.24] it's all piled in this heap of garbage
[2483.20 - 2487.40] discarded
[2485.24 - 2490.08] unbelievable
[2487.40 - 2493.48] and so that blew my mind when I left the
[2490.08 - 2496.96] dump that day with my dad with my father
[2493.48 - 2498.68] I left the dump that day I was just
[2496.96 - 2501.68] completely taken
[2498.68 - 2504.60] back completely taken
[2501.68 - 2506.00] back and you know what's really crazy
[2504.60 - 2507.88] that day that happened I'm going to tell
[2506.00 - 2509.32] you right now since I'm just being a
[2507.88 - 2511.64] little bit
[2509.32 - 2513.92] emotional me and my dad were walking out
[2511.64 - 2515.40] of that dump and it was an old one had
[2513.92 - 2516.92] kind of like a it was dirt road didn't
[2515.40 - 2518.80] even have cement
[2516.92 - 2521.68] and we were walking out of
[2518.80 - 2523.56] there and I looked on the ground and
[2521.68 - 2525.20] something shiny was on the ground and
[2523.56 - 2527.32] yeah there's bottle cap shiny there's
[2525.20 - 2530.36] flip tops there's all kinds of garbage
[2527.32 - 2531.76] aluminum foil everywhere Just Junk I
[2530.36 - 2535.72] looked down the
[2531.76 - 2538.08] ground and there was a quarter on the
[2535.72 - 2541.80] ground
[2538.08 - 2543.64] 1942 and it was silver so I didn't know
[2541.80 - 2545.00] it was silver until spirit said it was
[2543.64 - 2547.12] silver and I said well what do you mean
[2545.00 - 2550.40] it's Silver Spirit said that's a silver
[2547.12 - 2553.24] quarter that's not clad that's not you
[2550.40 - 2556.16] know that's not
[2553.24 - 2559.44] nickel it's not copper it's
[2556.16 - 2562.64] silver and I picked it up it was
[2559.44 - 2566.64] 1942 and my dad said hey that's an old
[2562.64 - 2568.36] coin I said wow was all beat up and
[2566.64 - 2572.16] spirit said that's
[2568.36 - 2575.16] silver Silver's anti
[2572.16 - 2576.88] viral silver is a different kind of
[2575.16 - 2580.48] metal
[2576.88 - 2582.76] and silver kills
[2580.48 - 2584.12] pathogens and sometimes Silver's you
[2582.76 - 2586.76] know
[2584.12 - 2588.20] sometimes sometimes I mean over the
[2586.76 - 2590.60] years it's it's important to take a
[2588.20 - 2592.16] little bit of the right kind not not not
[2590.60 - 2594.12] the not the wrong kinds there's wrong
[2592.16 - 2595.04] kinds out there but they remember being
[2594.12 - 2597.08] blown
[2595.04 - 2600.36] away by
[2597.08 - 2602.96] that and spirit said not all metals are
[2600.36 - 2605.08] bad not all metals are bad cuz Spirit
[2602.96 - 2607.16] was teaching about all the toxic heavy
[2605.08 - 2609.32] metals
[2607.16 - 2612.32] and spirit said that there's going to be
[2609.32 - 2614.12] some Silvers down the road where people
[2612.32 - 2616.20] can actually take a little for a sore
[2614.12 - 2618.60] throat take a
[2616.20 - 2621.44] teaspoon for a sore throat to kill off
[2618.60 - 2623.44] strep strep a cockus and I heard that at
[2621.44 - 2626.20] 8 years old walking out of the
[2623.44 - 2628.60] dump unbelievable that just blows me
[2626.20 - 2630.12] away I know it's off topic a little bit
[2628.60 - 2632.20] but when you're dealing with viruses
[2630.12 - 2633.96] strep and pathogens especially strep too
[2632.20 - 2635.64] and eoli all that it sits inside the
[2633.96 - 2637.60] liver it sits inside of Staff it sits
[2635.64 - 2638.88] inside the Li liver SEI sits inside the
[2637.60 - 2640.56] liver all these different bugs
[2638.88 - 2644.36] everywhere funguses and everything else
[2640.56 - 2646.16] bad funguses that it's all store inside
[2644.36 - 2647.92] the liver and everything and then when
[2646.16 - 2650.24] they come out or we get a bad sore
[2647.92 - 2652.52] throat we get a tons lights viral
[2650.24 - 2654.48] infection you know teaspoon of the right
[2652.52 - 2655.40] kind of silver can really really move
[2654.48 - 2657.60] people
[2655.40 - 2659.76] forward take a little bit of that once
[2657.60 - 2663.36] in a while but it just blew me away that
[2659.76 - 2666.28] information at 8 years old
[2663.36 - 2668.20] anyway it was a great day that day cuz I
[2666.28 - 2671.08] had the window inside the liver and I
[2668.20 - 2673.16] was able to tell people all the time
[2671.08 - 2675.44] about the emotional end of it all it's
[2673.16 - 2678.56] really
[2675.44 - 2681.64] powerful you know you know the liver and
[2678.56 - 2685.68] it's miscellaneous storage
[2681.64 - 2687.64] area it just it it gets bombarded at the
[2685.68 - 2689.92] same time with our high fat diet that's
[2687.64 - 2691.52] what really bugs me and it's it's just
[2689.92 - 2693.08] everywhere and the trend is just high
[2691.52 - 2694.96] fat high protein which is high fat by
[2693.08 - 2697.92] the way high protein don't get fooled by
[2694.96 - 2700.88] that and it's just it's amazing what
[2697.92 - 2702.72] happens it gets bombarded by Fats too
[2700.88 - 2704.04] it's a whole another thing and do you
[2702.72 - 2705.32] know what fats do and the reason why
[2704.04 - 2707.60] have to tell you this the more fats you
[2705.32 - 2709.28] eat in your diet the more adrenaline has
[2707.60 - 2711.80] to be dispersed out of the adrenal
[2709.28 - 2714.20] glands and more epinephrine more
[2711.80 - 2717.60] adrenaline cortisols everywhere it's got
[2714.20 - 2719.24] to actually be dispersed to try to thin
[2717.60 - 2721.68] out the blood so the fats don't give you
[2719.24 - 2724.96] a heart attack on a daily better daily a
[2721.68 - 2726.72] daily level a daily level they got to
[2724.96 - 2728.64] remember that so lowering your fats is
[2726.72 - 2730.48] so important you can listen to the other
[2728.64 - 2733.08] shows about the liver and everything
[2730.48 - 2734.76] else and you'll hear about that how you
[2733.08 - 2737.88] how to do that and all
[2734.76 - 2740.36] that trying to take in and process all
[2737.88 - 2743.32] these fats the best it can our liver it
[2740.36 - 2746.08] will throw in
[2743.32 - 2748.20] items like the
[2746.08 - 2750.80] troublemakers from a funeral reception
[2748.20 - 2754.04] the ham sandwich hairspray from a
[2750.80 - 2756.36] prom that went bad you know air
[2754.04 - 2758.20] freshener from a waiting room or you
[2756.36 - 2762.88] were awaiting bad
[2758.20 - 2765.60] news chemically treated fire pitted wood
[2762.88 - 2768.28] and excess alcohol from a cookout where
[2765.60 - 2769.72] your relationship broke up and even
[2768.28 - 2772.92] little bits of
[2769.72 - 2774.84] adrenaline the liver is not being sloppy
[2772.92 - 2777.20] and throwing them all together it's
[2774.84 - 2778.68] being efficient it throws all these
[2777.20 - 2782.20] together and stores them inside the
[2778.68 - 2784.72] liver and it releases them all together
[2782.20 - 2787.84] out and when we bombard the liver with
[2784.72 - 2791.76] high fat diets we trap it in
[2787.84 - 2794.52] longer so and sometimes
[2791.76 - 2796.56] sometimes the fat itself that gets
[2794.52 - 2798.48] trapped in the liver absorbs all of this
[2796.56 - 2801.16] and holds it on for a lifetime until you
[2798.48 - 2801.16] start working it
[2801.56 - 2808.56] out it's amazing how it
[2805.92 - 2810.84] works basically the liver's goal is to
[2808.56 - 2812.76] use chemical functions to sort out all
[2810.84 - 2814.80] this miscellaneous pile that I talked
[2812.76 - 2818.48] about at the dump
[2814.80 - 2821.40] site sort it out and categ categorize it
[2818.48 - 2825.20] can't say that word right
[2821.40 - 2828.20] today most people aren't on track to
[2825.20 - 2830.68] give the liver the break it needs most
[2828.20 - 2832.24] all people are not on track to give it
[2830.68 - 2835.52] the break it
[2832.24 - 2837.44] needs we leave it to be alone like a
[2835.52 - 2840.80] lone wolf a
[2837.44 - 2844.72] worker a worker at the dump instead of
[2840.80 - 2846.76] teaming up with it because we don't know
[2844.72 - 2847.92] otherwise
[2846.76 - 2849.48] and you know what when I was at that
[2847.92 - 2852.08] dump when I was 8 years old there was a
[2849.48 - 2856.08] whole bunch of people working it wasn't
[2852.08 - 2858.76] one person it was like a whole bunch of
[2856.08 - 2860.36] guys piling up garbage here driving a
[2858.76 - 2862.72] truck over here dumping garbage here
[2860.36 - 2864.40] pulling something out of here doing this
[2862.72 - 2865.84] bringing things here another truckload
[2864.40 - 2867.36] it was like a whole massive team of
[2865.84 - 2870.48] people but guess what your liver's only
[2867.36 - 2872.56] one one person your liver's only one
[2870.48 - 2874.76] thing one Lone Wolf doing it alone
[2872.56 - 2877.72] that's why we need to help it to help
[2874.76 - 2877.72] our emotional
[2878.52 - 2883.48] abilities so organizing this
[2881.00 - 2885.28] miscellaneous pile is last on the
[2883.48 - 2887.44] liver's to-do list and that's another
[2885.28 - 2890.60] problem it often doesn't get to
[2887.44 - 2893.04] it when it comes time to purge which
[2890.60 - 2895.88] you'll know in liver 369 in this book so
[2893.04 - 2899.48] you can get rid of the emotional
[2895.88 - 2901.72] instability it's time to purge you make
[2899.48 - 2906.24] room for
[2901.72 - 2908.60] more it's this pile that gets emptied
[2906.24 - 2910.68] out comes that ham sandwich that I
[2908.60 - 2912.20] talked about at the funeral out comes
[2910.68 - 2916.28] that miscellaneous
[2912.20 - 2919.44] junk the the liver wants to toss out and
[2916.28 - 2921.40] out goes Cravings along with sorrow
[2919.44 - 2924.08] Cravings can happen too you can get you
[2921.40 - 2926.64] start craving and that's it and you
[2924.08 - 2927.96] won't be able to trace back to anything
[2926.64 - 2931.28] you won't be able to trace back to
[2927.96 - 2933.68] anything anytime you detox you guys
[2931.28 - 2936.40] whether in a healthy way endorsed by the
[2933.68 - 2940.20] liver which this book's about
[2936.40 - 2942.68] out and this book's endorsed by the
[2940.20 - 2944.36] liver when it's forced to empty some of
[2942.68 - 2946.84] its miscellaneous storage bin I talked
[2944.36 - 2948.60] about that dump site to make room for
[2946.84 - 2952.08] anything else in the moment emotions can
[2948.60 - 2956.32] come up as the toxins leave it happens
[2952.08 - 2962.08] both during the liver's stress bomb time
[2956.32 - 2962.08] that is the NeverEnding indulge in
[2962.12 - 2967.92] Buffet basically what's happening is you
[2965.24 - 2969.72] know the liver has emotions too it's
[2967.92 - 2972.44] just doing the best it can to run the
[2969.72 - 2974.08] whole show in there and it's by itself
[2972.44 - 2975.88] just like we do the best we can when
[2974.08 - 2977.52] we're sitting somewhere and we end up
[2975.88 - 2979.08] eating things we're not supposed to eat
[2977.52 - 2980.76] and we're stressed out and we're tired
[2979.08 - 2982.52] and it's the only resources we got in
[2980.76 - 2984.20] front of us and everything
[2982.52 - 2986.60] else
[2984.20 - 2988.60] unbelievable how it
[2986.60 - 2991.84] works
[2988.60 - 2994.52] Cravings are serious I mean you may
[2991.84 - 2996.12] crave a honey baked ham double bacon
[2994.52 - 2998.64] cheeseburger
[2996.12 - 3001.20] I mean you may crave
[2998.64 - 3002.60] pizza but your body's not telling you I
[3001.20 - 3003.96] need protein and your liver is not
[3002.60 - 3005.72] telling you I need protein and your
[3003.96 - 3008.56] liver is not telling you I need iron and
[3005.72 - 3008.56] protein no it's
[3008.80 - 3013.44] not the best way to handle these
[3011.48 - 3016.76] Cravings that even happen on emotional
[3013.44 - 3019.72] level when when all this is going on the
[3016.76 - 3021.56] best way is to not to give it to them
[3019.72 - 3024.76] not to give into to them I mean sorry
[3021.56 - 3027.20] about that not to give in to them and
[3024.76 - 3030.16] instead we got to opt for that celery
[3027.20 - 3032.56] juice opt for those steamed potatoes
[3030.16 - 3036.08] without butter on them without fats on
[3032.56 - 3038.28] them opt for sweet potatoes without oils
[3036.08 - 3040.84] on them opt for and if you you know I
[3038.28 - 3043.76] mean do the best you can opt for some
[3040.84 - 3045.40] butternut squash steamed butter baked
[3043.76 - 3048.56] butter not squash why not do baked
[3045.40 - 3050.16] butter opt for bananas banana ice cream
[3048.56 - 3051.60] opt for so many recipes that are in The
[3050.16 - 3054.68] Liver Rescue book and so many other
[3051.60 - 3057.44] books of mine you know opt for all these
[3054.68 - 3057.44] other options
[3058.24 - 3062.08] yeah yeah if you have to opt for a
[3060.36 - 3063.88] little avocado sh if you have to opt for
[3062.08 - 3066.08] something else sure I mean sure but try
[3063.88 - 3067.16] to opt for some of these other ones some
[3066.08 - 3069.88] of these other
[3067.16 - 3073.00] things I know leafy greens aren't
[3069.88 - 3075.84] comforting I know but they sure as heck
[3073.00 - 3078.16] fix your liver I know celery juice isn't
[3075.84 - 3082.12] comforting I know it's not I mean some
[3078.16 - 3083.72] people say it is I mean I feel it is but
[3082.12 - 3086.72] it fixes your
[3083.72 - 3089.72] liver and it repairs emotional
[3086.72 - 3090.96] damage and it just does wonders it's
[3089.72 - 3094.00] like a

[3207.56 - 3211.12] the adrenaline now that the liver has to
[3209.60 - 3212.80] absorb and what does that mean it
[3211.12 - 3215.76] doesn't mean you can't stop being hurt
[3212.80 - 3217.44] and you can't stop thinking about the
[3215.76 - 3218.92] whatever you went through and whatever
[3217.44 - 3220.28] kind of breakup or relationship or
[3218.92 - 3222.40] whatever it is it doesn't mean you you
[3220.28 - 3223.60] don't have to you know avoid that it
[3222.40 - 3225.92] just
[3223.60 - 3227.56] means you just have to take care of
[3225.92 - 3230.44] yourself a little bit in between it
[3227.56 - 3233.00] somehow some way and get the willpower
[3230.44 - 3234.76] and dig it up out and say I got to take
[3233.00 - 3236.68] care of my liver a little bit I'm going
[3234.76 - 3238.24] through crap in hard times I'm going
[3236.68 - 3240.00] through struggles but I got to take my
[3238.24 - 3241.60] care care of my liver a little bit I

[3243.04 - 3246.40] want to eat a little bit better when I
[3244.60 - 3247.68] can even if you have no appetite and you
[3246.40 - 3250.40] can't eat at all for two weeks cuz
[3247.68 - 3252.52] you're just miserable you just have to
[3250.40 - 3253.88] think about the liver drink more lemon

[3253.88 - 3258.00] time if it's all you can stomach and
[3255.64 - 3260.40] stand drink more lemon water if you're
[3258.00 - 3263.24] going through a hard time and if you're
