1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
therapies don't always taste good

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:07,319
because it's just about the medicine

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:10,860
right but this one I happen to like I do

4
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:12,840
love this brain shot very much I use it

5
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:14,820
very much we're also going to talk about

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:18,000
micro dosing today

7
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:20,220
get ready for that you might want to

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,039
fasten your seat belts get your seat

9
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:24,420
belts on click them in

10
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,160
because we're gonna be talking about

11
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:28,980
micro dosing

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,840
talking about micro dosing is definitely

13
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:33,719
going to piss a bunch of people off but

14
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:36,000
that's okay because I don't know I just

15
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:37,260
gotta say the words from message the

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,460
words from above and we'll see what

17
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:41,399
happens

18
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:43,920
hopefully everybody's strapped in and

19
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:45,899
ready for the ride but today is about

20
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,320
finding

21
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:55,559
your true purpose stabilizer

22
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:58,260
day 20. oh my God day 20. okay

23
00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:00,420
how many of you guys have gone 20 days

24
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:03,480
and if you haven't like I said yesterday

25
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,739
it's okay go three days five days that's

26
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:07,820
okay

27
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:09,720
but how many of you have gotten 20 days

28
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:12,900
we are

29
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:14,700
on the 20th day incredible finding a

30
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,680
purpose stabilizer I am making it today

31
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:19,439
I got my berries in front of me I got

32
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,540
the right well blueberry powder I got

33
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:24,780
the parsley in front of me I'm ready to

34
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:26,100
go let's talk about microdosing and

35
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,360
we're also going to talk about the soil

36
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:31,880
I want to prepare you we're going to do

37
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,880
a little bit of some soul talking too

38
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:36,240
psychedelics

39
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,400
that are considered plant medicine have

40
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:41,040
gained popularity recently with the

41
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,720
theory that everything is okay if you

42
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,119
micro dose it

43
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,220
don't worry everything's okay you're

44
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,700
micro dosing it right that's the theory

45
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,700
out there

46
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:55,380
now we're very confused in the health

47
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,659
World about what plant medicine actually

48
00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:01,200
is

49
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:04,020
it's a trend to take something toxic and

50
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,200
put the term plant medicine in front of

51
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,200
it

52
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,640
so what the trend is is you take

53
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:14,400
something that's toxic to the brain

54
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:16,800
damaging to the brain and then place the

55
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,879
words plant medicine in front of that

56
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,739
toxin

57
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:22,080
and then it's okay

58
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:24,780
now it's okay

59
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,940
very interesting right

60
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:28,980
it's a trend to take something toxic and

61
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:32,819
put the term plant medicine in front of

62
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:35,520
it as if that makes it not toxic or even

63
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:37,920
not dangerous so when you stick plant

64
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:40,620
medicine in front of something it makes

65
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:43,860
it so it's like not toxic not dangerous

66
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:46,920
not damaging to the brain

67
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:49,160
totally fine

68
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:52,500
are you guys sure you're ready for this

69
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:54,959
on my page number 151

70
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:57,000
and I'm in brain saver are you sure

71
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,459
you're ready for this okay because I

72
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,140
have not talked about micro dosing and

73
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:02,819
we're doing a little bit on it right

74
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:04,080
we're still going to do a lot more on it

75
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:06,360
but right now we're going to cover some

76
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:10,040
Erica Malik life after this challenge is

77
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,040
going to feel a little empty

78
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,560
it's over the 20 day

79
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:23,099
the plant medicine label right

80
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:26,040
plant medicine label

81
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:28,019
is like an excuse to use plants that

82
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:30,239
have chemical compounds that hinder our

83
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:34,620
body hurt our body or set our healing

84
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:37,099
back yes I said it set our healing back

85
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:37,099
truth

86
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,180
as long as we put it in that plant

87
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:43,980
medicine category

88
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:47,400
it's plant medicine

89
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:49,920
a substance has immunity and is

90
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,299
considered a safe viable way to heal so

91
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,980
what's happening right now in the world

92
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:54,840
of micro dosing in the world of plant

93
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:58,440
medicine they're using the term plant

94
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:02,580
medicine to safeify it

95
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:05,159
to make it safe to safify it

96
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:07,860
that's what they're doing now it's

97
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:11,580
interesting really really the term plant

98
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:14,159
medicine should be all about fruits

99
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:16,320
that's plant medicine leafy greens

100
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:20,359
that's plant medicine

101
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:24,120
herbs uh-huh herbs

102
00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:27,060
wild foods and vegetables

103
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:29,820
that are not mind altering

104
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:34,500
or adrenaline surging that's remember

105
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:37,380
that word right there adrenaline surging

106
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:40,979
keep that in mind

107
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:42,300
sources of plant chemical compounds

108
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:45,360
so what's happening right now micro

109
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:47,460
dosing is very trendy micro dosing plant

110
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,520
medicine

111
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:52,680
that's damaging to the adrenals is

112
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:54,780
actually trendy right now

113
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,880
that's not plant medicine that's just

114
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:59,100
something toxic that hinders and damages

115
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,880
the adrenals and the Brain

116
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,880
and liver

117
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:06,060
so really the term plant medicine should

118
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:07,740
be all about fruits leafy greens herbs

119
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:09,780
wild foods and vegetables that are not

120
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,979
mind altering or adrenaline surging

121
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:12,900
that's the next note right there get

122
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:14,960
ready for that fashion your seatbelts on

123
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:17,600
for this ride we're just starting

124
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:20,699
we're just starting

125
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:23,419
adrenaline surging

126
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:25,199
that's what Ayahuasca plant medicine

127
00:05:23,419 --> 00:05:28,820
psilocybins a lot of other plant

128
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:32,780
medicines do cacao

129
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:32,780
adrenaline surging

130
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:38,340
sure it's a fun ride for some not

131
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:40,020
everybody it's a fun ride it's an

132
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:42,180
adrenaline surging ride

133
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:44,220
Aurora says can you explain what is

134
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:46,800
microdosing microdosing is where they

135
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:49,860
take something toxic like a psilocybin

136
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,960
or right Ayahuasca or something

137
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:55,259
I I can name some others too and I think

138
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:57,720
I will and if you put it in smaller

139
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:59,699
dosages because what happened with

140
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:02,039
Ayahuasca is originally

141
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:03,660
people would take large dosages of it so

142
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:06,780
when you go to an ayahuasca ceremony

143
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:08,940
right you would drink a bowl of it

144
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:10,860
you would you would Blitz and blast out

145
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:12,360
your mind so bad you wouldn't even know

146
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:15,120
who you were you'd be screaming and

147
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:17,759
rolling around in the dirt vomiting

148
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,400
pulling scratching your eyes out

149
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:23,460
I've had people come to me years ago

150
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:26,220
that scratched their own eyeballs out

151
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:29,039
during an ayahuasca ceremony would I

152
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:31,740
mean scratched they were blind forever

153
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:33,780
they dug their eyeballs out

154
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:35,940
with their hands

155
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:38,280
so what happened was too much of that

156
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:39,960
happened too many people got injured too

157
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:42,360
many people got hurt too many people got

158
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:44,280
brain damaged so they started to lower

159
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,840
the dosage with something no one thought

160
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:48,539
of

161
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,580
after all those years it was realized

162
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:53,340
maybe it should be a smaller amount

163
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:55,620
maybe it should be a tiny amount

164
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:58,440
and so micro dosing took on a whole new

165
00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:00,180
world where it's micro dosing only do a

166
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:02,940
little bit of a toxic poisonous mushroom

167
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:05,960
only do a little bit of

168
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:09,120
Ayahuasca only do a little bit

169
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:11,460
Lolita's uh zat says I was Heavy in

170
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,860
Ayahuasca for many years and it would

171
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:15,300
it would end up destroying me for a long

172
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:19,620
period of time

173
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:21,960
oh sorry and it wound up destroying me

174
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:23,639
for a long period of time Elite I

175
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,960
totally understand so I'm just

176
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:26,340
explaining a little bit about the micro

177
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,539
dosing

178
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:29,539
and how that works

179
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:32,900
I mean honestly

180
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,479
and you know what's cool telling you

181
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:39,240
guys because I don't think a lot of you

182
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:41,759
guys get mad about this stuff but before

183
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:43,740
before I was like censored and stuff

184
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,300
right Shadow band and everything else

185
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:48,840
and

186
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:51,539
open to a large large Arena of people

187
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:54,840
seeing it man people would go berserk

188
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:56,880
right they go berserk it's incredible

189
00:07:54,840 --> 00:08:00,599
how things work you talk about

190
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:03,560
Ayahuasca people get angry you know and

191
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:03,560
they still do out there

192
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:06,960
um let's go

193
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:08,759
so really the term plant medicine should

194
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,460
be all about fruits leafy greens herbs

195
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:13,139
wild foods and vegetables that are not

196
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:15,240
mind-altering or adrenaline surging

197
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:17,400
sources the plant chemical compounds

198
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:20,180
plant medicine should be about

199
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,180
blackberries

200
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,280
which is an incredible form of plant

201
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,960
medicine

202
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,960
plant medicine should be about wild

203
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:30,300
blueberries wild blueberries

204
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:34,080
blackberries are almost wild cultivated

205
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:36,659
blackberries are almost wild they're so

206
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,880
strong they're the alternative if you

207
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:40,560
can't do like the wild blueberry or

208
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,779
something like that right I talk about

209
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:45,720
the alternative the Blackberry is is

210
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:48,060
it's not it's not a wild blueberry but

211
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:50,040
it offers still partial partial

212
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:52,740
phytochemical compounds and partial

213
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:55,279
anthocyanins that are almost in that

214
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,279
wild state

215
00:08:55,860 --> 00:09:01,019
plant medicine should be about

216
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:02,880
blackberries wild blueberries lemon balm

217
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:05,160
that's plant medicine

218
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:09,660
lemon balm

219
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:11,580
Rosemary Ginger thyme right it's a lemon

220
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:13,320
balm right there

221
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:17,519
Rosemary

222
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:20,600
Ginger thyme celery

223
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,600
celery is plant medicine

224
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:24,420
spinach

225
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:25,800
that's an incredible run that's

226
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:28,080
incredible

227
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:30,240
leafy green

228
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,380
an incredible

229
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:35,459
one

230
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:39,200
cilantro can't say enough about cilantro

231
00:09:35,459 --> 00:09:39,200
and shiitake mushrooms

232
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,480
those are just a few examples instead

233
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:48,360
plant medicine is being used to give

234
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:52,140
benediction psilocybin mushrooms also

235
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:53,279
known as magic mushrooms or shrooms

236
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,540
ayahuasca

237
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:56,399
even

238
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:59,220
cacao

239
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,959
like cacao ceremonies intense cacao

240
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:04,200
consumers right

241
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:05,880
matcha tea and other green tea

242
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:08,700
let's go into the next section playing

243
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:10,500
with poisons this is really cool the

244
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:12,000
problem we have with both alternative

245
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:14,519
and conventional medicine we have a

246
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,260
problem with alternative medicine what

247
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:19,440
there's no problem with alternative

248
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:20,820
medicine Alternatives it's perfect

249
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,860
there's a problem with conventional

250
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:24,540
medicine

251
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:27,060
the problem we have with both

252
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:29,040
alternative and conventional medicine is

253
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:32,160
the same problem we have with Discerning

254
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:35,640
what plant medicine really is

255
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:37,860
no one knows why anyone lives with

256
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:41,820
chronic symptoms and conditions it's

257
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:43,620
obvious it's evident it's factual

258
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:45,839
spiritual path to true love says is

259
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:47,820
microdosing like Homeopathy nope it's

260
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:50,240
not Homeopathy it's not like Homeopathy

261
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,240
good question

262
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,240
this is an important part I'm reading

263
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:56,100
right here so check this out very

264
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,380
important part

265
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:02,120
no one knows why anyone lives with

266
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:02,120
chronic symptoms and conditions fact

267
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:06,480
fact

268
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,800
alternative medicines guessing games we

269
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,000
know that it's been guessing games for

270
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,620
decades

271
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,019
conventional medicine which cause

272
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:15,779
unknown with everything

273
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:18,000
marjor herb I know one guy who did it

274
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:20,399
and he was not even able to go home

275
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:24,320
family picked him up from the United

276
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:24,320
States and took him home to Europe

277
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:30,839
I know many people who have done it

278
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:34,740
Carnage is unbelievable

279
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:37,440
Spoils of War are unbelievable with it

280
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:39,779
it's really a sad thing all right

281
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,120
no one knows why someone has anxiety

282
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:43,680
depression bipolar I'm sorry but nobody

283
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:45,000
knows

284
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,620
I mean if you have the medical medium

285
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,360
books and you learn the truth about why

286
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:51,660
somebody has these things it's awesome

287
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:53,820
but Lana says Erica yes very scary I

288
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:55,860
didn't know about Anthony back then but

289
00:11:53,820 --> 00:12:00,200
I know I learned what was exactly

290
00:11:55,860 --> 00:12:00,200
happening to me it was damaging my brain

291
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:06,839
no one knows why someone has anxiety

292
00:12:03,899 --> 00:12:09,800
depression bipolar disorder or OCD no

293
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:12,540
one knows why anyone has brain fog

294
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:14,640
fatigue or the Myriad of neurological

295
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:16,680
symptoms that we explore throughout this

296
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:19,200
book and the other books

297
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:22,019
medical media books medical communities

298
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,640
May categorize a given struggle as

299
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:26,399
autoimmune

300
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:28,579
that's not the same answer that's not

301
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:31,740
the answer

302
00:12:28,579 --> 00:12:33,899
autoimmune still means we don't know why

303
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:35,399
anybody has any of these symptoms

304
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:37,579
conditions or health struggles so

305
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:39,600
autoimmune is not the answer

306
00:12:37,579 --> 00:12:44,160
autoimmune means

307
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:48,480
your body created an auto antibody

308
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:50,540
to go and destroy your organs

309
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,519
without your permission

310
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:55,440
autoimmune is not why people are sick

311
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,339
I talk about this in the medical medium

312
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,860
books

313
00:12:56,339 --> 00:13:03,200
pathogens are what's getting into

314
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:03,200
people's organs and injuring organs

315
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:13,680
it all falls into the same pot of

316
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:16,380
guessing game soup

317
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:18,660
the conventional doctor doesn't know why

318
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:23,180
you have depression

319
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:23,180
yet offers an antidepressant

320
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:29,639
the alternative doctor doesn't know why

321
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,639
you have depression

322
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:35,579
yet offers you a better diet

323
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:37,500
a regular exercise routine

324
00:13:35,579 --> 00:13:40,019
the recommendation to get rid of

325
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:42,839
processed foods and the instruction to

326
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:45,440
take some vitamin D a multivitamin and

327
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:45,440
some fish oil

328
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,560
while not every doctor's visit will

329
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:52,320
yield these exact recommendations

330
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:55,019
whatever the varying recommendations are

331
00:13:52,320 --> 00:14:00,860
they still won't be based on knowing the

332
00:13:55,019 --> 00:14:00,860
true underlying why of your suffering

333
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,779
perhaps the doctor believes gut health

334
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:09,959
is causing your depression that candida

335
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:11,220
are sibo or leaky gut or microbiome is

336
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:13,740
to blame

337
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:16,980
ring a bell anybody perhaps the doctor

338
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:18,899
believes you have a chemical imbalance a

339
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:21,300
neurotransmitter issue such as a

340
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:25,019
dopamine deficiency whatever the case

341
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:26,899
it's still a case of we don't know why

342
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:30,420
you're sick

343
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:33,139
we don't know why you have depression or

344
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:33,139
chronic symptoms

345
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:39,360
Spirit of compassion just blows my mind

346
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:42,079
who talks about that who even who even

347
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,079
talks about this

348
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:46,800
no one

349
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:49,740
the same guessing game technique has led

350
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:51,480
to a widespread interest in psychedelics

351
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:55,519
and microdosing

352
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:55,519
Nobody Knows Why anybody's sick

353
00:14:55,980 --> 00:15:00,600
getting the connection now

354
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:01,860
alternative medicine doesn't know why

355
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,600
anybody's sick

356
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:05,100
conventional medicine doesn't know any

357
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,680
why anybody's sick they both play

358
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:09,420
guessing games conventional might say

359
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,180
try this antidepressant try this

360
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:13,620
anti-anxiety Med try this antiocd med

361
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:16,920
try this antidepressant again

362
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:19,440
conventional alternative medicine

363
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:21,959
might say hop on the table get a few

364
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:24,240
needles thrown in your back

365
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:27,660
go off to the you know go off to the gut

366
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:31,380
doctor take a microbiome thing

367
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:33,480
head to the uh you know naturopath get a

368
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:37,139
new diet go to the functional medicine

369
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:40,139
doctor and get a test

370
00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:42,420
a blood test but in the end

371
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:44,399
we're in this position where people with

372
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:45,420
severe depression still won't get an

373
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,000
answer

374
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:52,040
or other conditions still won't get an

375
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,040
answer so what that leads

376
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:56,459
it's a case of we don't know why you're

377
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:58,920
sick we don't know why you have

378
00:15:56,459 --> 00:16:01,440
depression or any chronic symptom so the

379
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:03,959
same guessing game you guys the same

380
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:06,660
guessing game technique has led to

381
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:08,100
widespread interest in psychedelics and

382
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:10,339
microdosing

383
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:14,339
conventional medicine is talking about

384
00:16:10,339 --> 00:16:17,279
using psychedelics now

385
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:21,420
conventional medicine is so lost with

386
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:24,779
why people have problems mentally

387
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:27,720
that they're trying to tap into the

388
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:29,360
Psychedelic movement

389
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:32,699
conventional medicine wants to

390
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:34,800
encapsulate and create and synthesize

391
00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:38,899
psychedelics

392
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,899
and offer it for mental health

393
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:46,079
someone searched for anything to try any

394
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:49,019
answers leads them to the door of the

395
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:51,000
darker side of plant medicine it's the

396
00:16:49,019 --> 00:16:53,300
darker side it's kind of like the dark

397
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,300
web

398
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:57,660
you have no answers you've been there

399
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:59,220
you've done that you tried alternative

400
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:01,139
medicine you tried conventional medicine

401
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:03,600
you feel like you're losing your mind

402
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:06,720
you feel like you're sick and you

403
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:10,640
stumble across micro dosing the darker

404
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,640
side of medicine plant medicine

405
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:15,600
I said for years that just because

406
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:17,720
something falls under the umbrella of

407
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:22,520
ancient

408
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:22,520
doesn't mean it's safe or perfect

409
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,079
in the ancient days

410
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,480
people would sacrifice people all the

411
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,660
time

412
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:38,400
a thousand people would go up

413
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:41,039
on a cliff

414
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:44,960
someone would come

415
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:44,960
half a thousand people strapped in

416
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,520
to a big wooden log a pole and they

417
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:51,660
would literally cut open everybody's

418
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:54,360
hearts and they would take out the

419
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:58,340
hearts of a thousand people

420
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:58,340
and throw the heart into a pit of fire

421
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:03,660
we're on page 152 we're in brain saver

422
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:06,120
reading about microdosing

423
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:07,740
it was ancient does that mean it was

424
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:09,960
good

425
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:12,480
does that mean it was great

426
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:13,919
sacrificing humans sacred ripping their

427
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,900
hearts out of their bodies cutting their

428
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:19,620
chest open the rib cage just explode

429
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:22,440
open because if you cut perfectly right

430
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:24,600
just the right fashion the rib cage just

431
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:27,299
pops

432
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:29,400
and it opens up the door like and that's

433
00:18:27,299 --> 00:18:32,220
what they used to do for sacrifice it

434
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:34,380
they did that all over this planet two

435
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:37,160
thousand years ago three thousand four

436
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:37,160
thousand years ago

437
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,400
even later than that

438
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,140
your chest pops open your heart's

439
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:45,240
beating while you're still alive and

440
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:47,400
then they cut your heart out throw it in

441
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:50,580
a pit of fire it was an ancient practice

442
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:52,559
was it a good thing it was ancient so it

443
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:54,179
must have been good anything ancient is

444
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:56,039
great nothing wrong with anything

445
00:18:54,179 --> 00:18:58,020
ancient at all

446
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:59,880
once it's under the umbrella of ancient

447
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:02,400
or ancient medicine or ancient whatever

448
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:04,500
it's great what about all the Mercury

449
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,120
elixirs that were given to people what

450
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:08,580
about Quicksilver

451
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:10,440
all through Europe in the 1700s in the

452
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:12,600
1800s they offered Quicksilver everybody

453
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:15,240
was drinking Mercury where did they get

454
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:18,299
that advice they got it from Chinese

455
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:19,980
medicine Emperors would drink would they

456
00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:22,200
would drink Quicksilver it was just

457
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:24,000
Mercury elixirs right that was an

458
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:26,640
ancient practice

459
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:30,660
that led into Europe using Quicksilver

460
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:32,039
so Quicksilver was was the medicine for

461
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:33,299
anybody who was sick didn't matter if

462
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:35,280
you were a baby didn't matter if you

463
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:37,440
were an adult didn't matter who you were

464
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,539
you go to the doctor and you drink a

465
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,860
whole glass of straight Mercury you lose

466
00:19:39,539 --> 00:19:42,660
your mind

467
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:44,880
and you don't even know who you are you

468
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:46,559
leave and you're tremoring and shaking

469
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,539
and your brains and your eyeballs almost

470
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:50,580
pop out of your head

471
00:19:48,539 --> 00:19:52,880
that was the practice

472
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:57,620
but since it was ancient

473
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,620
must be perfect must be amazing

474
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:08,460
over the years I've heard this hundreds

475
00:20:06,419 --> 00:20:10,740
of times the family reaching out to me

476
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:12,780
because their daughter or son was at an

477
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:15,419
Ayahuasca or other psychedelic ceremony

478
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:17,940
and barely made it out alive and it was

479
00:20:15,419 --> 00:20:21,120
still to this day and still to this day

480
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:23,340
they're suffering from brain injuries

481
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:26,400
an IG

482
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:28,559
eni says I've watched my friend using

483
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:31,080
Ayahuasca slowly lose his mind every

484
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:32,580
time he did it then he started licking

485
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:34,919
frogs

486
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:37,559
that's another uh thing too by the way

487
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:40,260
is the Frog poison I forgot to talk

488
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:41,880
about that I've got him on the heavy

489
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,960
metal detox and it's really making a

490
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,160
difference because it's bringing his

491
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:47,820
brain back

492
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:49,799
frog poison is another thing another

493
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:52,460
micro dose

494
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:52,460
practice

495
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:58,460
that's such a neurotoxin a frog poison

496
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:58,460
it's the craziest thing

497
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:06,660
Amber says my dad took a lot of L LSD

498
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:10,700
in the 60s and he is the most depressing

499
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:10,700
person I'm sorry to hear that

500
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:16,679
there's of Ayahuasca or other

501
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:21,380
psychedelics will say the practitioner

502
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:21,380
leading the ceremony was the problem

503
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:32,039
whoa but don't worry my ayahuasca

504
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:33,600
um practitioner my Ayahuasca Shaman I'm

505
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:35,100

506
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:39,059
good or practitioners being bad or good

507
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:42,059
it's whatever my Ayahuasca Guru

508
00:21:39,059 --> 00:21:43,919
does it way better my Ayahuasca gurus in

509
00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:46,799

and does it for like all the cool people

511
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:51,960

but you know what I hang around with the

515
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,559
cool people in LA

516
00:22:00,539 --> 00:22:03,659

I know all the who's who

518
00:22:03,659 --> 00:22:10,140
so I got the cool shamans and the cool

519
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:11,400
Ayahuasca gurus and we don't really get

520
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:14,220
hurt

521
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:16,440
yeah I've heard that effortless Endeavor

522
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:19,080
says have you seen the leading experts

523
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:21,600
in Psychology are now totally promoting

524
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:23,220
psychedelics I am I talked about that a

525
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:25,500
minute ago where

526
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:27,980
conventional wisdom is heading there too

527
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,980
I know

528
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:32,820
yeah because they're desperate people

529
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,520
are sick and when you're sick and you

530
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:37,919
can't find anything that works you can't

531
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:40,080
find the right

532
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:41,400
protocol to help people with all these

533
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:44,299
different conditions

534
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:47,880
you don't know the answers

535
00:22:44,299 --> 00:22:51,179
you don't have the answers

536
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:52,980
protocols see protocols you don't have

537
00:22:51,179 --> 00:22:54,780
the answers

538
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:57,480
and when you don't have the answers out

539
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:59,640
there yeah even conventional medicine is

540
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:00,539
in the top psychology you know experts

541
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,360
are going to be playing around with

542
00:23:00,539 --> 00:23:05,700
psychedelics of course they're desperate

543
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:07,679
desperate to get somebody something

544
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:10,940
but they're just gonna

545
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:10,940
they're just gonna have them up

546
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:19,380
jumping on Trends is what they're doing

547
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:22,200
they all do this science says it's great

548
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:24,900
but down the road once billions are

549
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:26,520
damaged and mangled

550
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:30,059
science will say it's not good anymore

551
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:33,020
but science never pays any prices

552
00:23:30,059 --> 00:23:33,020
just the people

553
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,580
foreign

554
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,380
Defenders of Ayahuasca or other

555
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:45,720
psychedelics will say the practitioner

556
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:47,340
leading the ceremony was the problem and

557
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:49,919
that you have to be careful who you

558
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:52,020
choose to guide you

559
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:54,299
I've heard that one a lot in the

560
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:56,220
Psychedelic realm you didn't have the

561
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:58,799
right guy guide you with the Frog poison

562
00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:02,159
but now you can't speak or talk because

563
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:05,179
it totally screwed up

564
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:05,179
your brain stem

565
00:24:06,059 --> 00:24:10,559
this is not to disrespect anyone

566
00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:12,480
involved in Ayahuasca ceremonies or any

567
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:14,580
kind of indigenous technique of

568
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,140
spiritual healing

569
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:17,940
foreign

570
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:19,980
because that's what also somebody will

571
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:21,960
someone will say to be like oh you're

572
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:22,980
just what are you harping on indigenous

573
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:25,260
people

574
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:26,760
because Ayahuasca was originally a whole

575
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:29,780
indigenous thing is that what you're

576
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:29,780
doing medical media

577
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:37,200
so this is not to just disrespect any

578
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:39,120
involved in Ayahuasca ceremonies or any

579
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:42,659
kind of indigenous technique of

580
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:46,520
spiritual healing indigenous cultures

581
00:24:42,659 --> 00:24:46,520
have also grown bananas

582
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:53,580
it's interesting right

583
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:56,659
indigenous cultures have grown bananas

584
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:59,039
that's a plant medicine

585
00:24:56,659 --> 00:25:02,299
indigenous cultures have also grown

586
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:06,440
spices such as vanilla bean cinnamon

587
00:25:02,299 --> 00:25:06,440
turmeric and ginger

588
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:12,000
there are non-toxic these are non-toxic

589
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,980
and have healing properties plant

590
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,559
medicine

591
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:19,380
while some of these can be self-limiting

592
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:21,919
meaning that large quantities can be

593
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:21,919
irritating

594
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:29,520
like spice they are not dangerous

595
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:32,279
our brain does not see them as an enemy

596
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:35,460
nor does our immune system or body or

597
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:38,940
adrenals at the same time whether we're

598
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:42,240
an indigenous culture or not we can all

599
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:45,299
grow eat and play around with poisons

600
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:47,159
many non-indigenous people become guides

601
00:25:45,299 --> 00:25:49,140
or practitioners who administer

602
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:50,400
psychedelics

603
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:51,900
it's really important to know this

604
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,220
information rising out of the ashes says

605
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:55,919
oh my God I had a friend

606
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:59,159
that did that don't have contact with

607
00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:04,039
her because she lost it reality and she

608
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:04,039
got so spaced and so paranoid so sad

609
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:11,100
what I mean to address here is the

610
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:13,320
person who's looking for answers to

611
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:15,179
chronic illness the person who's

612
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:18,120
desperate to try anything and gets

613
00:26:15,179 --> 00:26:20,820
further injured in that process Landing

614
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:23,100
a life of much more suffering and

615
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:24,779
hardship than they already had with

616
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:28,320
their condition

617
00:26:24,779 --> 00:26:30,720
people in their lives may pass it off as

618
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:32,580
a bad trip sweep it under the carpet

619
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,500
first of all I gotta say something be

620
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:36,779
really clear here I'm not just talking

621
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:38,820
about somebody who does

622
00:26:36,779 --> 00:26:41,100
a whole bunch of acid has a really bad

623
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:43,080
trip and everybody's saying I'm not I

624
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:45,539
don't do drugs I don't do drugs I micro

625
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:48,600
dose with like a careful with a careful

626
00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:50,520
guide and and that's not doing drugs

627
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:53,039
people have to understand that like this

628
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:55,140
is this is

629
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:58,700
a really important

630
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:58,700
part of it all

631
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:04,039
because someone's going to say that's

632
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,039
not me that's somebody that

633
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:09,000
is doing some heavy drugs

634
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,980
and they lost their mind because of a

635
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,659
bad trip

636
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:16,140
but that's not what I'm talking about

637
00:27:12,659 --> 00:27:18,659
here I'm talking about every day people

638
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:21,720
who aren't doing drugs they don't

639
00:27:18,659 --> 00:27:24,000
they're not about doing drugs they're

640
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:26,640
looking for answers and they get pulled

641
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,919
into this whole spiritual aspect of wait

642
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,120
a minute the answers are in the

643
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:32,100
spiritual experience you're going to

644
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:34,380
have when you do some micro dosing it's

645
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:36,179
safe it's a small amount it's not like

646
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:37,860
it used to be you're not going to be

647
00:27:36,179 --> 00:27:39,960
tripping like you're on acid and people

648
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:41,820
are LED into this but that's what I'm

649
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:43,320
talking about people in their lives may

650
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:44,940
pass it off as a bad trip because

651
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:47,340
they'll have a bad trip from that too

652
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:49,140
sweep it under the carpet and call it

653
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:52,620
their Journey

654
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:54,779
saying it was supposed to happen

655
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:57,380
here's something really sad to know

656
00:27:54,779 --> 00:27:57,380
right now

657
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:03,419
is that when someone does get injured

658
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:05,760
in a retreat

659
00:28:03,419 --> 00:28:08,779
after doing ayahuasca

660
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,779
everybody else

661
00:28:09,299 --> 00:28:13,620
tells them

662
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:15,960
it was supposed to happen it's part of

663
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:19,080
your journey

664
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:22,020
the person's like going home

665
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:23,400
with an injured brain paranoia severe

666
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:26,000
OCD

667
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:28,380
severe delusion

668
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:32,100
adrenals completely fried

669
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:34,559
brain fog crazy brain fog they're going

670
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:35,820
home like wait a minute I thought this

671
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:37,440
experience was supposed to be good I

672
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:38,940
thought this was supposed to be good I

673
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,440
thought this was supposed to be good and

674
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:42,179
then everybody at the retreat's like oh

675
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,620
that was supposed to happen that was

676
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:46,380
your journey that was your spiritual

677
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:49,620
journey you're going to learn from it

678
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:51,539
you're going to grow from it

679
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:54,620
how do I know this that's what I've seen

680
00:28:51,539 --> 00:28:54,620
happen so many times

681
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:59,940
and that they had to learn something

682
00:28:57,179 --> 00:29:01,500
meanwhile it was an injury and not a

683
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:03,120
positive experience of any kind for

684
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:06,720
anyone

685
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:08,340
it was just a flat out injury

686
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:11,279
it wasn't

687
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:13,919
a positive experience and now it's about

688
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:17,220
how do we recover from that

689
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:19,260
maybe what maybe no one even realizes

690
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:21,240
that their brain health is declining

691
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:23,399
from injury

692
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:26,700
whether a decline that continues over

693
00:29:23,399 --> 00:29:29,940
time after one trip or a steady decline

694
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:31,380
with each psychedelic experience another

695
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:33,179
problem that happens if you're not

696
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:35,520
taking care of your brain

697
00:29:33,179 --> 00:29:37,380
it can decline over time from this stuff

698
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:40,080
I told you guys have to fasten your seat

699
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:41,880
belts for this ride

700
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,919
micro dosing new marketing for

701
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:46,320
psychedelics

702
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:47,880
I'm in the next section I'm on page 153

703
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:50,460
of brain saver this is really good

704
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:52,200
information for day 20 of the brain shot

705
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:53,940
therapy cleanse challenge this is the

706
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,380
last day of the 20-day challenge an

707
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:57,059
incredible day finding your purpose

708
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:58,980
stabilizer why are we talking about

709
00:29:57,059 --> 00:30:00,120
micro dosing we're talking about finding

710
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:04,440
our purpose because that's another

711
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:06,299
reason why so many people lead to micro

712
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:08,100
dosing because they're trying to find

713
00:30:06,299 --> 00:30:10,200
their purpose they feel sad they feel

714
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:12,059
lost they feel insecure about everything

715
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:15,059
in their life and they go to try to find

716
00:30:12,059 --> 00:30:17,480
their purpose through psychedelics

717
00:30:15,059 --> 00:30:19,440
maybe you know somebody

718
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:21,000
microdosing the new marketing for

719
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,820
psychedelics the landscape around

720
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,820
psychedelics has changed in recent years

721
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:29,580
the mistakes of the past consuming High

722
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:31,740
dosages of psychedelics are less common

723
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:33,720
like I was saying earlier they don't do

724
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:36,240
big bowls of Ayahuasca and everybody

725
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:38,159
takes a huge sip of it they do small

726
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,720
amounts they even put it inside little

727
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:41,899
candies and other stuff you know the

728
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,899
game

729
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:50,940
too many obvious injuries have occurred

730
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:52,980
and how now there's the term microdosing

731
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:55,860
to clean up the mess

732
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:59,360
the term microdosing was created to

733
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:59,360
clean up the mess

734
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:05,760
it's unbelievable

735
00:31:03,059 --> 00:31:07,679
we talk it up as though if we micro dose

736
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:10,200
we give ourselves permission to partake

737
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:12,240
don't worry it's only micro dosing it's

738
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:15,179
okay everybody's doing it

739
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:17,220
it's like a new level of stupidity

740
00:31:15,179 --> 00:31:19,500
happening

741
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:21,480
let's see Chef Tien it says I was

742
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:23,940
injured and told it was part of the

743
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:26,399
journey also told the dose was too much

744
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:27,960
such BS

745
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:30,500
thank you for leaving your comment that

746
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:30,500
was on IG

747
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:35,340
we give ourselves permission to partake

748
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:38,520
as if it's now a controlled environment

749
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:40,860
because micro dosing is controlled

750
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:41,940
that's how we're supposed to be led to

751
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:44,340
feel

752
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:47,159
oh it's micro dosing I can handle that

753
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:48,419
it's control and since everybody wants

754
00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:50,460
control over themselves it's like no

755
00:31:48,419 --> 00:31:52,980
that's controlled so

756
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:55,880
sounds like a small amount it it's

757
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:55,880
probably going to be fine

758
00:31:56,520 --> 00:32:01,679
term microdosing makes us feel safe

759
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:04,020
it makes us feel safe

760
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:05,340
it's like ah don't worry it's only micro

761
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:07,799
dosing

762
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:09,299
so the human psyche microdosing also

763
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:11,220
implies that there's some scientific

764
00:32:09,299 --> 00:32:13,700
nature involved like someone figured

765
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,700
something out

766
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:19,679
so it's like oh my

767
00:32:17,159 --> 00:32:21,840
ayahuasca

768
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:24,840
practitioner Guru

769
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:27,360
Shaman my Ayahuasca guy says it's micro

770
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:29,220
dosing so he has it all done so there's

771
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:31,200
a science behind it there must be this

772
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:33,120
great science behind it when it's not

773
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,559
there's nothing behind it it's just a

774
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,600
smaller dosage it's someone's kind of

775
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:39,000
like shimmying up

776
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:41,279
accounts bookkeeper says on YouTube this

777
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,279
is true both my brothers who passed away

778
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:46,919
from these substances were blamed by the

779
00:32:44,279 --> 00:32:49,380
community of substance user they were in

780
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:51,720
as being flawed or being too sensitive

781
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:53,159
or too too susceptible

782
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:56,039
my God

783
00:32:53,159 --> 00:32:57,600
this still my heart pours out to you

784
00:32:56,039 --> 00:33:00,600
it really does

785
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:02,720
it starts getting me upset because you

786
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,720
know

787
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:07,500
yeah

788
00:33:05,399 --> 00:33:09,779
I could read into it pretty deep and

789
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:11,779
it's it's rough

790
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:11,779
um

791
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:17,580
check this out to the human psyche micro

792
00:33:15,659 --> 00:33:19,260
dosing also implies that there's a

793
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:20,460
scientific nature involved but there's

794
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:22,919
none

795
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:25,500
we feel secure in the sense that there's

796
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:27,659
some type of Science advising it well

797
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:29,159
there must be like some scientific setup

798
00:33:27,659 --> 00:33:31,860
on that

799
00:33:29,159 --> 00:33:34,140
don't worry conventional medicine is

800
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:35,220
taking psychedelics now and they're

801
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:37,080
going to be making their own

802
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:39,480
prescriptions and dosages and everything

803
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:41,399
else and you can call it micro dosing or

804
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:43,559
whatever you want to call it

805
00:33:41,399 --> 00:33:45,179
right don't put the science behind it

806
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:47,360
they'll just make a smaller dose or

807
00:33:45,179 --> 00:33:47,360
something

808
00:33:50,039 --> 00:33:53,059
really interesting

809
00:33:54,480 --> 00:34:01,760
so here's a comment Laquita says it just

810
00:33:58,679 --> 00:34:05,220
seems like this is a little extreme

811
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:07,980
it doesn't have to be a yes this is good

812
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:10,500
or no this is bad there's so much Nuance

813
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:12,599
to psychedelics I'm not sure how helpful

814
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:14,940
this is

815
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:16,379
well we're getting into pretty soon if

816
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:18,480
you can stay on here

817
00:34:16,379 --> 00:34:20,099
we're getting into what psychedelics do

818
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:23,700
to the brain which is actually really

819
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:25,379
important but I don't know if you were

820
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:27,780
here a couple of minutes ago when I was

821
00:34:25,379 --> 00:34:30,899
reading some of the comments

822
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:33,480
some families were destroyed

823
00:34:30,899 --> 00:34:36,060
some people died

824
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:38,220
life was lost and some people lost their

825
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:41,520
minds just with the few comments I'm

826
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:43,560
reading from people's experiences

827
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:46,520
laughs

828
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:46,520
and

829
00:34:47,099 --> 00:34:51,000
I'm all connected into the world of like

830
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:53,940
who's who out there and doing different

831
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,780
things and people are micro dosing out

832
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:56,399
there

833
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:58,859
that's just what they're doing and

834
00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:00,839
people are getting injured by it

835
00:34:58,859 --> 00:35:03,240
actually injured

836
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:05,160
so what's the nuances

837
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:08,339
some dude had a good

838
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:10,320
had a good thing about it and

839
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:12,180
or some person had a good thing that

840
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,500
happened with it and just that's a

841
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:16,700
Nuance don't worry about the other

842
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:16,700
person who gets injured

843
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:21,859
I don't know what those nuances are

844
00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:27,300
what about if somebody's scale wasn't

845
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:29,160
tipped yet and they go and do it

846
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:30,839
you follow those people later in life

847
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:32,339
and guess what their problems are worse

848
00:35:30,839 --> 00:35:34,440
or you follow the people that are

849
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:36,720
offering micro dosing and psychedelics

850
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:38,940
you follow them later in their life see

851
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:40,440
where their life is in 10 15 years ask

852
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:41,640
them what they're doing now chances are

853
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:43,800
they'll be like I don't do that anymore

854
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:45,300
that stuff really screwed me up you just

855
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:47,099
don't know you don't know what the

856
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:49,020
future brings you don't know the people

857
00:35:47,099 --> 00:35:50,339
that are actually doing it how like 10

858
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:52,260
years later they're like I can't even

859
00:35:50,339 --> 00:35:54,060
touch that stuff I did that stuff and I

860
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:56,300
think it screwed me up but you won't

861
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:56,300
know

862
00:35:56,700 --> 00:36:01,500
I I I appreciate your question but hang

863
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:03,240
on because I want to talk about you know

864
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:06,980
if you could stay here I want to talk

865
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:06,980
about the rest of it about the brain

866
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,820
we feel secure in the sense that there's

867
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:16,680
some type of Science advising it that

868
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:19,640
some types of study has occurred and

869
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:19,640
proves efficacy

870
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:24,000
as you've learned about scientific

871
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:25,619
studies

872
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,180
they're really just theories combined

873
00:36:25,619 --> 00:36:29,160
with never-ending games of trial and

874
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:31,680
error done by people

875
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:34,560
done by a person

876
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:37,500
science are people

877
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:39,180
science isn't this machine this massive

878
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:41,700
machine

879
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:43,320
where it's this big computer base up in

880
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:45,720
the sky in the heavens and it knows

881
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:49,380
everything and that's science so science

882
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:52,560
can never be wrong it's this big giant

883
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:54,660
orb that's floating up in the atmosphere

884
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:56,640
that knows everything

885
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:58,800
science is a bunch of people screwing

886
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:00,960
around paid money to screw out in a lab

887
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:04,160
hoping that human error doesn't blow at

888
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,160
every second which it does

889
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:11,000
Gabriella I lost three friends because

890
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:14,220
of Ayahuasca I nearly died as well

891
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:16,320
Gabriella I'm so sorry to hear that

892
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:17,940
truly

893
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,619
but apparently the other person that

894
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:23,820
commented said well you can't really

895
00:37:19,619 --> 00:37:26,040
whatever I seem to nuances and

896
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:30,500
I respect everybody commenting I'm just

897
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:30,500
saying that it's it's it's just like

898
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:38,760
as you learned about scientific studies

899
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:40,500
they're just theories combined with

900
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:43,220
never-ending guessing games trial and

901
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:46,320
error from humans

902
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:49,380
labeling drug

903
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:51,599
use as micro dosing provides a sense of

904
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:54,180
safety to a wider variety of people it

905
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:56,640
opens up the gamma to a whole bunch of

906
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:59,700
people who are sick and nobody knows why

907
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:01,680
they're sick nobody has an answer to why

908
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:04,020
they're sick their mental health is

909
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:05,579
declining they're suffering they tried

910
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:07,740
everything that they can find already

911
00:38:05,579 --> 00:38:09,660
nobody knows why they're suffering

912
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:11,579
emotionally and mentally they're

913
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:14,579
struggling out there

914
00:38:11,579 --> 00:38:17,400
and then psychedelics is the new answer

915
00:38:14,579 --> 00:38:20,099
microdosing is the new answer

916
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:22,079
it's just another total just screw me

917
00:38:20,099 --> 00:38:25,099
over kind of deal and that's just the

918
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:25,099
way it works it's sad

919
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:30,780
now it's tempting to many more people

920
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:32,400
who would never partake in this someone

921
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:34,140
would never partake in any of this stuff

922
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,460
but when you label it micro dosing and

923
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:37,859
kind of put like a little bit of a

924
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:39,660
science behind it it opens a door for a

925
00:38:37,859 --> 00:38:42,320
huge Floodgate of people to be like all

926
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:42,320
right I'll try it

927
00:38:44,579 --> 00:38:48,359
Dr Nesbitt doesn't even do psychedelics

928
00:38:46,859 --> 00:38:50,880
but he's here today and he's actually

929
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:52,200
going to be talking about microdosing

930
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,420
and other things and the prescriptions

931
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:56,720
he's he's taking that he prescribes

932
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:56,720
himself

933
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:05,520
on IG

934
00:39:01,619 --> 00:39:06,420
yemri says how come I connect it to my

935
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:08,520
soul

936
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:10,920
and felt unconditional love for the

937
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:12,900
first time when I did Ayahuasca could it

938
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:14,940
be that even though it's a toxin it

939
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:16,740
connects you to a source we are coming

940
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:19,020
to that in just a minute will you please

941
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:22,859
hang on for that answer it's actually

942
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:24,540
coming the answer is mind-blowing

943
00:39:22,859 --> 00:39:26,700
now it's tempting to many more people

944
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:28,320
who would have never partaked and and

945
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:31,260
didn't feel like they would partake

946
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:32,700
unless they had some kind of Science and

947
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:34,740
monitoring to it which makes you feel

948
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:39,359
like micro dosing is science it's no

949
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:42,000
longer just a niche crowd Meech crowd a

950
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:44,579
people who go into the desert sit around

951
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,140
a campfire and drink a whole bowl of

952
00:39:44,579 --> 00:39:48,420
psychedelics

953
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:49,920
it's no longer that anymore that still

954
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:51,119
exists that's still happening but it's

955
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:54,240
not like that anymore it's this micro

956
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:56,400
dosing thing marketing has now made it

957
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:57,900
seem like science has been applied to

958
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,040
psychedelics

959
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:01,560
it hasn't

960
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:03,980
a tactic that pulls in a much bigger

961
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,980
crowd

962
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:12,380
a hippie dude in his basement

963
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:19,700
putting droppers of ayahuasca

964
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:19,700
on M MS

965
00:40:19,859 --> 00:40:25,160
and calling it micro dosing

966
00:40:22,619 --> 00:40:28,440
there's no science to that

967
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:31,020
the term microdosing acts as a safeguard

968
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:33,540
it makes someone believe that the person

969
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:35,520
and I like hippies I'm not happy I'm not

970
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:38,000
anti-anybody

971
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,000
whatever

972
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:44,700
said a doctor the other day call me a

973
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:46,380
hippie because I have a ponytail

974
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:48,660
let's have a bun

975
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:50,579
I was like what did you just call me

976
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:52,140
so you go like the hippie do going on

977
00:40:50,579 --> 00:40:53,520
you're like a hippie I go yeah sure

978
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:55,200
whatever

979
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:57,359
fine

980
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:59,520
it doesn't bother me it's great the term

981
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:01,800
microdosing acts as a safeguard it makes

982
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:04,079
someone believe that the person offering

983
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:06,540
a therapy and using the term microdosing

984
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:07,859
knows a lot it makes you think that they

985
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:10,440
know a lot especially when you're

986
00:41:07,859 --> 00:41:12,480
younger you're younger and there's just

987
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:13,859
an older dude who's the shaman or the

988
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:15,359
guru that's playing around with the

989
00:41:13,859 --> 00:41:17,640
micro dosing the Frog poison and stuff

990
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:19,200
and here you are you're 22 years old and

991
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:21,119
you're just like whoa I'm here my

992
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:23,579
brain's totally messed up I want answers

993
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:25,140
I want a spiritual experience and it's

994
00:41:23,579 --> 00:41:27,480
like you got this dude he's 30 something

995
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:29,160
years old he's an expert at micro dosing

996
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:31,079
and he's putting exact amount of fraud

997
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:33,359
poison on whatever and he's putting the

998
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:36,380
exact then you're just like whoa yeah

999
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:36,380
good luck

1000
00:41:36,839 --> 00:41:40,619
breaks my heart it makes someone believe

1001
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,359
that the person offering a therapy and

1002
00:41:40,619 --> 00:41:44,940
using the term microdosing knows a lot

1003
00:41:42,359 --> 00:41:47,400
that they're very smart or well educated

1004
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:49,079
in the process they're offering well

1005
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:51,599
educated

1006
00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:53,339
maybe that's true to some degree that

1007
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:56,579
the person offering a micro dosing

1008
00:41:53,339 --> 00:41:59,280
technique knows a lot about the theory

1009
00:41:56,579 --> 00:42:02,720
yet even if you know a lot about a game

1010
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:02,720
it's still a game

1011
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:09,200
there's still a wake of people injured

1012
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:13,200
from psychedelics people who went into

1013
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:15,420
microdosing therapy with migraines for

1014
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:17,400
example and ended up with migraines that

1015
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:19,440
were far worse coupled with additional

1016
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:22,380
symptoms

1017
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:24,359
I know people that went into

1018
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:26,160
microdosing

1019
00:42:24,359 --> 00:42:28,079
safely

1020
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:30,599
so they called it

1021
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:33,420
and ended up and ended up

1022
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:35,640
with some worse migraines what

1023
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:37,260
psychedelics do is put the body in a

1024
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:40,280
crisis state

1025
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:40,280
get ready for this

1026
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:47,160
when we go through a crisis State and

1027
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:49,140
come out of it we change in some ways as

1028
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:50,940
a person

1029
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:53,940
critical

1030
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:57,240
critical to know this

1031
00:42:53,940 --> 00:43:00,839
huge piece of information from above

1032
00:42:57,240 --> 00:43:02,280
what psychedelics do is put the body in

1033
00:43:00,839 --> 00:43:04,819
a crisis

1034
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:04,819
state

1035
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:12,000
wait to hear this when we go through a

1036
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:15,359
crisis State and come out of it we

1037
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,980
change in some ways as a person

1038
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:19,140
what I'm about to read to you that's

1039
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:20,760
coming up

1040
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:24,180
believable

1041
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:26,700
it's like surviving a 10 car pileup on

1042
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:30,180
the freeway

1043
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:32,520
your car flips over two or three times

1044
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:34,560
and you seem to walk out of it with a

1045
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:36,660
mild concussion while others around you

1046
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:38,819
died

1047
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:43,020
there's something that happens inside of

1048
00:43:38,819 --> 00:43:46,740
us when we survive any kind of crisis

1049
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:49,319
and that falls into spiritual change

1050
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:52,319
and when we induce ourselves with the

1051
00:43:49,319 --> 00:43:56,640
toxic chemical compound that throws our

1052
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:59,579
body into chaos I'll ask anybody frog

1053
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:03,480
poison psychedelic psilocybins

1054
00:43:59,579 --> 00:44:05,780
after it subsides we feel we spiritually

1055
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:05,780
grow

1056
00:44:07,319 --> 00:44:09,980
keep on going

1057
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:14,160
on IG

1058
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:16,560
Julie

1059
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:20,579
I did one of those ceremonies it ended

1060
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:22,200
in disaster for me awful do not go near

1061
00:44:20,579 --> 00:44:24,540
anything like that

1062
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:26,819
if it wasn't for me doing medical medium

1063
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:29,000
info it could have ended really bad for

1064
00:44:26,819 --> 00:44:29,000
me

1065
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:38,119
asanya says wow this is truly waking me

1066
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:41,280
up

1067
00:44:38,119 --> 00:44:44,880
okay here's the next part

1068
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:47,960
remember I said fasten your seat belts

1069
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:50,579
just get ready for the ride

1070
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:53,720
I might need some lemon balm which is

1071
00:44:50,579 --> 00:44:53,720
plant medicine

1072
00:44:55,440 --> 00:45:00,300
good stuff

1073
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:02,579
addicted to survival there's an

1074
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:04,980
addiction process that occurs with any

1075
00:45:02,579 --> 00:45:06,599
dose of psychedelics did I hear what I

1076
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:09,300
said there's an addiction process but

1077
00:45:06,599 --> 00:45:11,880
wait you hear this there's an addiction

1078
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:15,240
process that occurs with any dose of

1079
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:18,420
psychedelics the addiction to

1080
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:21,540
how did we survive that

1081
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:23,700
that was a heck of a ride

1082
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:26,940
and my spiritual teacher told me how

1083
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:31,040
much I've grown by doing it

1084
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:31,040
and I think I'm ready to do it again

1085
00:45:32,819 --> 00:45:37,700
does that ring a bell

1086
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:37,700
anyone

1087
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:41,339
especially when my spiritual teacher

1088
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:43,619
told me how much I've grown by doing it

1089
00:45:41,339 --> 00:45:45,540
there's an addiction process that starts

1090
00:45:43,619 --> 00:45:47,940
to occur

1091
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:51,540
One Of The Addictive aspects of

1092
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:54,300
psychedelics is the adrenaline surge

1093
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:57,060
that occurs when the poisons enter our

1094
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:59,460
bloodstream this is a big one when that

1095
00:45:57,060 --> 00:46:01,380
adrenaline's surging

1096
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:03,000
as the poisons because the poisons enter

1097
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:06,240
the bloodstream and your adrenals just

1098
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:09,420
explode that is a spiritual

1099
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:11,579
like experience all on its own because

1100
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:13,560
it's life or death

1101
00:46:11,579 --> 00:46:16,800
adrenaline being released that's your

1102
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:20,839
adrenals exploding like releasing piles

1103
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:20,839
of fear and Chaos adrenaline

1104
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:25,800
it's so addictive

1105
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:27,599
One Of The Addictive aspects of

1106
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:29,280
psychedelics is the adrenaline surge

1107
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:31,260
that occurs when the poisons enter our

1108
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:33,839
bloodstream when any kind of poison

1109
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:36,420
enters the bloodstream our body has to

1110
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:39,660
release a steroid compound

1111
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:43,560
to soften the blow so the brain hearts

1112
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:45,359
and lungs don't take the hit so hard

1113
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:48,180
when that poison enters your body that

1114
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:50,640
micro dosing poison enters the body

1115
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:54,140
a steroid compound has to be released to

1116
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:54,140
try to save your brain

1117
00:46:55,319 --> 00:47:01,099
Carrie Pearson said this is totally

1118
00:46:57,180 --> 00:47:01,099
mind-blowing thanks aw and SOC

1119
00:47:07,619 --> 00:47:13,140
a dose even a micro dose of psychedelics

1120
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:15,660
is no different

1121
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:18,000
as our brain starts to get poisoned by

1122
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:21,839
micro dosing it sends an emergency

1123
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:23,460
signal to the brain stem and then out to

1124
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:26,099
the adrenals

1125
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:27,359
looking for the adrenals to save its

1126
00:47:26,099 --> 00:47:29,040
life

1127
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:31,140
okay

1128
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:33,599
when that microdosing poison enters the

1129
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:35,520
bloodstream your brain is begging your

1130
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:39,060
adrenals to save its life

1131
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:41,220
that's the spiritual experience

1132
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:45,720
your brain

1133
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:48,180
is desperate for steroid compounds

1134
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:50,339
it's begging the adrenals to flood

1135
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:55,040
everything it has

1136
00:47:50,339 --> 00:47:55,040
to try to save itself

1137
00:47:55,800 --> 00:48:00,900
an intense adrenaline blend is released

1138
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:03,359
to stop Strokes from occurring when

1139
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:05,760
you're doing ayahuasca

1140
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:10,280
and other psychedelics

1141
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:10,280
and blood clots from forming

1142
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:18,480
adrenaline is the blood thinner

1143
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:19,680
when your body goes into chaos when

1144
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:22,339
you're getting the microdosing and

1145
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:22,339
psychedelics

1146
00:48:22,619 --> 00:48:28,020
microdosing of psychedelics

1147
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:30,480
your brain begs for the adrenals to save

1148
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:34,020
its life so that strokes and blood clots

1149
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:36,359
don't occur I'm unpaid someone asked 154

1150
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:39,359
brain saver

1151
00:48:36,359 --> 00:48:39,359
foreign

1152
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:45,119
the left hand upper paragraph could read

1153
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:46,440
along with me

1154
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:48,720
left side

1155
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:50,700
an intense adrenaline blend is released

1156
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:52,500
to stop Strokes from occurring in blood

1157
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:55,319
clots from forming

1158
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:57,420
in part by thinning the blood and in

1159
00:48:55,319 --> 00:48:59,400
part by opening blood vessels back up

1160
00:48:57,420 --> 00:49:03,660
with steroid compounds as the vessels

1161
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:05,520
are closing from the poison

1162
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:07,500
when you're putting in the Frog poison

1163
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:08,819
when you're putting in the psychedelics

1164
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:11,220
when you're putting in all this crazy

1165
00:49:08,819 --> 00:49:13,859
psilocybins when you're putting in the

1166
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:15,780
Ayahuasca your blood vessels start to

1167
00:49:13,859 --> 00:49:18,079
constrict from the poison inside your

1168
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:18,079
brain

1169
00:49:18,599 --> 00:49:25,200
your brain calls out for help to your

1170
00:49:22,859 --> 00:49:27,180
adrenals your adrenals release a steroid

1171
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:31,099
compound to try to stop your blood

1172
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:31,099
vessels in your brain from constricting

1173
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:44,660
so they don't close up

1174
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:44,660
and create a stroke

1175
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:53,420
I probably think this is one of the most

1176
00:49:49,619 --> 00:49:53,420
profound pieces of all of this

1177
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:58,859
is as your adrenals have to flood all of

1178
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:01,800
this adrenaline which is just crazy fear

1179
00:49:58,859 --> 00:50:03,660
and Chaos steroids and they have to get

1180
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:06,060
to the brain in time so that blood

1181
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:07,740
vessels in your brain don't close up and

1182
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:09,839
in your heart so blood vessels

1183
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:11,460
throughout your body don't close

1184
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:13,500
why are they closing because they're

1185
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:15,480
poisoned

1186
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:18,480
why do we need that blood thinning

1187
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:20,640
effect question mark because our immune

1188
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:23,940
system responds to any poison in the

1189
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:27,560
body as a foreign invader

1190
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:30,240
and it tries to stop the foreign

1191
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:32,339
Invader before it gets to the most

1192
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:34,500
critical places in the body such as the

1193
00:50:32,339 --> 00:50:37,319
brain in the heart and the lungs

1194
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:39,660
our immune cells try to devour check

1195
00:50:37,319 --> 00:50:42,240
this out when you put Ayahuasca in your

1196
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:45,079
body your immune cells are trying to

1197
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:45,079
devour it

1198
00:50:46,859 --> 00:50:52,500
which can actually create a blood clot

1199
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:56,599
because it's attacking the poison

1200
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:56,599
desperately to try to stop it

1201
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:06,660
four four Starlight on YouTube my friend

1202
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:06,660
died from aneurysm post-psychedelics

1203
00:51:12,540 --> 00:51:16,640
you don't want to hear that it's just it

1204
00:51:14,819 --> 00:51:19,500
just kills me it's it's heartbreaking

1205
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:22,319
Reiki with Daria says I did Ayahuasca

1206
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:26,640
once was not planning to but convinced

1207
00:51:22,319 --> 00:51:29,819
my Shaman convinced by Shaman I trusted

1208
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:32,640
prayed for no trips I was just coming

1209
00:51:29,819 --> 00:51:35,099
for energy healing offered during the

1210
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:38,640
ceremony a month later my health issue

1211
00:51:35,099 --> 00:51:40,920
started so the tip the scale was tipped

1212
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:43,559
the scale was to talk about how that

1213
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:45,780
happens our immune system is built with

1214
00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:47,760
knowledge in it our immune system has

1215
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:50,160
Intelligence by the way you guys our

1216
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:53,180
immune system is highly intelligent it's

1217
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:53,180
the most intelligent

1218
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:57,300
you gotta see all those little immune

1219
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:58,980
cells if they were little brains

1220
00:51:57,300 --> 00:52:01,020
our immune system is built with

1221
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:03,540
knowledge and information in it to take

1222
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:05,579
risks to protect us our immune system

1223
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:08,880
knows

1224
00:52:05,579 --> 00:52:11,579
that a kerosene like corrosive substance

1225
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:14,640
adrenaline also known as epinephrine is

1226
00:52:11,579 --> 00:52:17,520
coming its way in seconds

1227
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:19,200
to dissolve the clot which will separate

1228
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:21,480
the immune cells and try to open blood

1229
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:23,099
vessel passageways so there's less

1230
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:25,140
constriction and poisons can leave the

1231
00:52:23,099 --> 00:52:27,000
brain and body so check this out

1232
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:29,520
your immune cells when you're on the

1233
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:31,559
psychedelics jumps on the Psychedelic

1234
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:32,880
poison and that's where the blood clot

1235
00:52:31,559 --> 00:52:36,240
starts happening

1236
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:39,960
your immune cells are jumping onto the

1237
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:42,420
Frog poison psilocybins the ayahuasca

1238
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:44,160
they're jumping on it and when those

1239
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:45,119
immune cells jump on it they Clump

1240
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,680
together

1241
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:48,960
at the same time they're clumping

1242
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:50,520
together the poison itself is

1243
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:52,319
constricting blood vessels throughout

1244
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:54,660
the body and the Brain

1245
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:56,339
and then the adrenaline is coming and

1246
00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:58,079
your immune cells know adrenaline is

1247
00:52:56,339 --> 00:53:00,420
coming and it comes in to blast the

1248
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:01,920
white blood cells off the poison and

1249
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:04,200
thin out the blood so the blood vessels

1250
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:06,240
start to open this is a highly Advanced

1251
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:08,579
information this is medical medium info

1252
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:10,440
information from above original and

1253
00:53:08,579 --> 00:53:12,000
unique and it will be probably just

1254
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:13,500
taken and poached like everything else

1255
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:17,000
along the way does that of the medical

1256
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:17,000
meaning books and not cited back

1257
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:21,300
but then we'll just keep on putting new

1258
00:53:19,619 --> 00:53:23,760
stuff out over and over because spirited

1259
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:26,280
has an endless Treasure Trove of

1260
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:27,900
incredible information to save lives and

1261
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:30,380
what I'm talking about goes against the

1262
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:30,380
trends

1263
00:53:31,079 --> 00:53:36,180
and that does mean no favors

1264
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:38,819
everybody else puts their tail between

1265
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:42,140
their legs in the health movement

1266
00:53:38,819 --> 00:53:42,140
they put their head down

1267
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:48,619
and they just go with the trends

1268
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:48,619
so you never have any friction

1269
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:56,099
but I have to watch over the chronically

1270
00:53:52,619 --> 00:53:58,619
ill and have their back

1271
00:53:56,099 --> 00:54:02,180
because it's a somebody has to have

1272
00:53:58,619 --> 00:54:02,180
the back of the chronically ill

1273
00:54:03,359 --> 00:54:09,619
eat better crap and all the other stuff

1274
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:09,619
is all fun all fun and games but

1275
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:13,280
people have gone through hell and back

1276
00:54:13,559 --> 00:54:18,180
they've been through a lot we have to

1277
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:19,980
always remember that

1278
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:21,359
chronic wheel have always been swept

1279
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:24,319
under the carpet

1280
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:24,319
mistreated

1281
00:54:25,619 --> 00:54:31,859
now adrenaline isn't kerosene

1282
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:34,260
but it's corrosive

1283
00:54:31,859 --> 00:54:36,119
it's not paint thinner yet it has a

1284
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:38,160
similar property as paint thinner and

1285
00:54:36,119 --> 00:54:40,140
kerosene in it

1286
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:42,720
that can start to dissolve and break

1287
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:44,880
down a blood clot that's thickening

1288
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:48,059
that's why when somebody has a stroke

1289
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:51,500
from a blood clot their adrenaline

1290
00:54:48,059 --> 00:54:53,400
starts to race and their heart does this

1291
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:57,559
adrenaline's flooding into their

1292
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:57,559
bloodstream to try to dissolve a clot

1293
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:03,359
says our immune system gathers around

1294
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:06,359
the poison in this case with psychedelic

1295
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:08,400
substances and tries to eat it up and

1296
00:55:06,359 --> 00:55:10,920
absorb it a large number of white blood

1297
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:12,540
cells surround the drugs poison chemical

1298
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:14,760
compounds

1299
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:17,640
the white blood cells start to group

1300
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:20,339
together and become a clump that can get

1301
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:23,280
caught in blood vessels

1302
00:55:20,339 --> 00:55:25,920
that's a blood clot

1303
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:27,599
from psychedelics then adrenaline enters

1304
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:29,640
the scene and starts to break up that

1305
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:30,960
clump

1306
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:32,760

1310
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:42,960

1311
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:45,540

explanation is remarkable I did magic

1317
00:55:55,140 --> 00:56:02,059
mushrooms once and my brain felt fried

1318
00:55:57,839 --> 00:56:02,059
for months after I was 20 years old

1319
00:56:05,579 --> 00:56:10,819
IG health of Hannah I am getting chills

1320
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:13,319
all over my body while listening to this

1321
00:56:10,819 --> 00:56:16,040
it's powerful information and it's

1322
00:56:13,319 --> 00:56:16,040
mind-blowing information

1323
00:56:19,559 --> 00:56:24,119
this chaos

1324
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:25,380
this chaos is part of the addiction to

1325
00:56:24,119 --> 00:56:27,180
psychedelics this is part of the

1326
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:29,280
addiction

1327
00:56:27,180 --> 00:56:31,440
this is part of what gets people to come

1328
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:33,000
back they don't know this is happening

1329
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:35,040
inside their body but this is part of

1330
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:37,619
the addiction

1331
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:40,500
even to micro doses of psycho

1332
00:56:37,619 --> 00:56:43,680
psychedelics or any other poisonous

1333
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:46,140
substance this is the chaos part of the

1334
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:48,780
addiction to psychedelics that

1335
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:52,440
adrenaline release into the bloodstream

1336
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:54,660
to thin the blood and protect the brain

1337
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:57,480
in that moment from the onslaught of

1338
00:56:54,660 --> 00:57:00,900
chemical compounds also saturating the

1339
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:02,640
brain creates extreme adrenaline highs

1340
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:05,460
at the same time these poisonous

1341
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:07,680
chemical compounds the psychedelics

1342
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:10,440
such as the ones found in psychedelics

1343
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:13,260
start hitting neurotransmitters in in

1344
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:15,900
neurons and and a hallucinogenic effect

1345
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:18,540
occurs even if it's mild

1346
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:20,520
the brain affects we associate with

1347
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:23,160
these substances both the adrenaline

1348
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:26,339
High and the hallucinogenic effect occur

1349
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:31,319
because of what's being consumed is

1350
00:57:26,339 --> 00:57:31,319
toxic the hallucinogenic experience

1351
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:37,079
is what we're talking about the

1352
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:39,599
aftermath is that we're coming down off

1353
00:57:37,079 --> 00:57:41,880
that adrenaline High our body is in the

1354
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:44,700
process recovery as the poisonous

1355
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:50,339
chemical compound is dissipating and we

1356
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:52,880
survived it we survived that micro dose

1357
00:57:50,339 --> 00:57:52,880
foreign

1358
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:59,460
it's not exactly the same as recovering

1359
00:57:56,940 --> 00:58:01,380
from a party where you got completely

1360
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:03,660
drunk and stoned and puked in the

1361
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:06,780
bathroom all night and then spent the

1362
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:09,180
next day in the stupor of a hangover yet

1363
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:11,720
there are similarities and it's very

1364
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:11,720
addictive

1365
00:58:13,319 --> 00:58:17,579
you want to go out again

1366
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:20,940
next week

1367
00:58:17,579 --> 00:58:24,359
get totally shit-faced

1368
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:29,339
totally puke all over the toilet seat

1369
00:58:24,359 --> 00:58:32,240
it's addictive page number is 154

1370
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:32,240
rain saver

1371
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:37,200
whichever substance sends your body into

1372
00:58:35,099 --> 00:58:38,520
survival mode remember that survival

1373
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:41,359
mode

1374
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:44,460
their parties you'll never forget

1375
00:58:41,359 --> 00:58:46,220
whether it was around a campfire doing

1376
00:58:44,460 --> 00:58:48,660
micro dosing and psychedelics

1377
00:58:46,220 --> 00:58:51,000
experiences that become etched in your

1378
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:54,240
Consciousness you'll never forget it the

1379
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:56,940
parties we never forgot aren't cures for

1380
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:59,160
depression anxiety brain fog fatigue or

1381
00:58:56,940 --> 00:59:00,119
neurological symptoms they only worsen

1382
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:02,460
them

1383
00:59:00,119 --> 00:59:06,180
one of the saddest parts of psychedelics

1384
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:09,180
is knowing a 25 year old or 28 year old

1385
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:11,420
who doesn't have any idea why they're

1386
00:59:09,180 --> 00:59:11,420
sick

1387
00:59:12,299 --> 00:59:18,599
he's seen a number of doctors tried a

1388
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:21,000
number of medications can't find relief

1389
00:59:18,599 --> 00:59:23,579
mentally or physically and then stumbles

1390
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:26,819
into the world of this can heal you

1391
00:59:23,579 --> 00:59:28,020
physically and spiritually it's one

1392
00:59:26,819 --> 00:59:31,020
thing

1393
00:59:28,020 --> 00:59:33,780
if you're not healing

1394
00:59:31,020 --> 00:59:35,640
so you take some junky vitamins try a

1395
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:38,339
range of animal protein and plant-based

1396
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:40,140
diets try a few different therapies and

1397
00:59:38,339 --> 00:59:42,119
healing techniques try conventional

1398
00:59:40,140 --> 00:59:44,160
Pharmaceuticals and you're still stuck

1399
00:59:42,119 --> 00:59:46,200
and you're still sick that's a better

1400
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:48,660
place to be than getting caught up in

1401
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:51,240
the world of psychedelics believing that

1402
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:54,740
maybe you have a spiritual block that's

1403
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:54,740
keeping you physically ill

1404
00:59:55,559 --> 01:00:00,119
what

1405
00:59:57,960 --> 01:00:02,819
so the saddest thing is like a 25 year

1406
01:00:00,119 --> 01:00:05,040
old a 22 year old a 28 year old whoever

1407
01:00:02,819 --> 01:00:07,460
are old right they have no idea why

1408
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:07,460
they're sick

1409
01:00:07,799 --> 01:00:12,680
and they stumble across these micro

1410
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:12,680
dosing things

1411
01:00:13,140 --> 01:00:16,980
and they get told you could heal

1412
01:00:14,819 --> 01:00:18,839
physically and spiritually

1413
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:21,420
this is different

1414
01:00:18,839 --> 01:00:22,859
than if someone was just taking junky

1415
01:00:21,420 --> 01:00:24,780
vitamins

1416
01:00:22,859 --> 01:00:26,160
trying a range of animal protein diets

1417
01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:27,480
and plant-based diets try different

1418
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:29,520
therapies write all the different

1419
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:31,380
therapies and techniques

1420
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:32,520
and that can be bad but this is still

1421
01:00:31,380 --> 01:00:34,079
different trying conventional

1422
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:35,819
Pharmaceuticals

1423
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:37,559
and you're still sick that's a better

1424
01:00:35,819 --> 01:00:39,299
place to be than getting caught up in

1425
01:00:37,559 --> 01:00:42,680
the world of psychedelics believing that

1426
01:00:39,299 --> 01:00:42,680
maybe you have a spiritual block

1427
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:46,020
how many lives were destroyed from

1428
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:48,180
people thinking they had a spiritual

1429
01:00:46,020 --> 01:00:50,400
block and meaning take psychedelic it's

1430
01:00:48,180 --> 01:00:53,040
okay to think you have a spiritual block

1431
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:55,740
it's okay to think you have a spiritual

1432
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:57,900
block I'm not totally denouncing that

1433
01:00:55,740 --> 01:01:01,380
I'm not totally saying are judging that

1434
01:00:57,900 --> 01:01:04,380
that's okay it's taking a poisonous

1435
01:01:01,380 --> 01:01:04,380
substance

1436
01:01:04,859 --> 01:01:09,540
because you think that

1437
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:11,760
Roni gets free on IG I took mushrooms in

1438
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:13,920
college and got sick immediately and

1439
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:16,500
threw them back up lied to my friend

1440
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:19,020
saying I was feeling it and didn't take

1441
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:20,819
any more thank God

1442
01:01:19,020 --> 01:01:23,339
that's where it goes wrong a lot of

1443
01:01:20,819 --> 01:01:25,380
people lie to friends so they other

1444
01:01:23,339 --> 01:01:27,420
friends don't think

1445
01:01:25,380 --> 01:01:29,220
that they're weak

1446
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:32,540
and it's why tons of stories out there

1447
01:01:29,220 --> 01:01:32,540
right you hear it

1448
01:01:34,740 --> 01:01:38,880
it's why it's how drugs are protected

1449
01:01:37,079 --> 01:01:40,380
out there too so a lot of people out

1450
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:41,880
there it's not what you did when you

1451
01:01:40,380 --> 01:01:44,339
were saying you were feeling it but

1452
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:45,839
there's other people right that could

1453
01:01:44,339 --> 01:01:47,880
have told you it was going to be great

1454
01:01:45,839 --> 01:01:49,260
and it made you sick and the other

1455
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:52,160
people that were you know that told you

1456
01:01:49,260 --> 01:01:52,160
it was going to be great

1457
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:58,920
they could also be lying right

1458
01:01:56,760 --> 01:02:00,780
you were just telling see you were just

1459
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:02,579
telling your friends you were with but

1460
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:04,980
you didn't go out there telling a whole

1461
01:02:02,579 --> 01:02:06,180
bunch of other people it was great but

1462
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:09,799
there were people out there that do

1463
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:09,799
they'll tell everybody it's great

1464
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:14,099
they won't tell people what really

1465
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:16,380
happened and that's why there's tons

1466
01:02:14,099 --> 01:02:18,599
tons that's why there's not tons of

1467
01:02:16,380 --> 01:02:19,740
stories out there there's a lot of

1468
01:02:18,599 --> 01:02:22,440
stories out there people getting hurt

1469
01:02:19,740 --> 01:02:23,880
but there's there's not tons of them and

1470
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:26,579
tons of them because people don't want

1471
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:30,180
to be uncool

1472
01:02:26,579 --> 01:02:32,400
and they don't want to you know

1473
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:34,260
look uncool

1474
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:36,660
Siana says you literally are saving

1475
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:40,579
Humanity one person at a time aw no one

1476
01:02:36,660 --> 01:02:40,579
else on the planet could say that

1477
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:49,319
Toady toad official

1478
01:02:46,619 --> 01:02:51,180
it's a pretty cool handle

1479
01:02:49,319 --> 01:02:52,980
what makes people feel like they had

1480
01:02:51,180 --> 01:02:55,500
incredible spiritual experiences

1481
01:02:52,980 --> 01:02:58,680
adrenaline from going into survival mode

1482
01:02:55,500 --> 01:03:00,000
yes I was just reading about that

1483
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:02,400
foreign

1484
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:04,740
it's from the brain dying it's basically

1485
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:06,960
a near-death experience

1486
01:03:04,740 --> 01:03:08,700
even on a small micro dosing level it's

1487
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:10,500
a near-death experience

1488
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:12,000
you may not think it's a near-death

1489
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:13,500
experience but your brain and your

1490
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:16,020
adrenals and your body think it's a

1491
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:18,299
near-death experience

1492
01:03:16,020 --> 01:03:19,799
and your soul is scared to death of

1493
01:03:18,299 --> 01:03:24,140
what's Happening

1494
01:03:19,799 --> 01:03:24,140
and so that makes that spiritual

1495
01:03:25,319 --> 01:03:28,980
part of it all

1496
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:31,799
when we lose time and we're exhausted

1497
01:03:28,980 --> 01:03:34,440
and we don't have answers that

1498
01:03:31,799 --> 01:03:37,079

1507
01:03:55,619 --> 01:03:59,880
within you

1508
01:03:57,420 --> 01:04:01,680

emotionally can improve and be healed

1513
01:04:06,599 --> 01:04:10,400
that's what they tell you

1514
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:17,940
this is uncool for me to say this

1515
01:04:14,339 --> 01:04:20,520
this is so uncool for me to say

1516
01:04:17,940 --> 01:04:22,799
right here

1517
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:24,540
when we lose time and we're exhausted

1518
01:04:22,799 --> 01:04:26,760
and we don't have the answers

1519
01:04:24,540 --> 01:04:28,319
and nothing's helping check this out the

1520
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:30,660
next easy sell is and this is really

1521
01:04:28,319 --> 01:04:34,140
uncool that I'm saying this

1522
01:04:30,660 --> 01:04:36,119
it has to be you you're the problem

1523
01:04:34,140 --> 01:04:38,579
this is a spiritual issue a mental and

1524
01:04:36,119 --> 01:04:40,680

be saying that bring you spiritual

1528
01:04:43,619 --> 01:04:47,280
growth take you on a spiritual journey

1529
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:49,319
where problems can be solved so the

1530
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:51,299
outcomes in how you feel physically and

1531
01:04:49,319 --> 01:04:52,980
emotionally can improve or be healed

1532
01:04:51,299 --> 01:04:55,319
what I'm saying is people out there are

1533
01:04:52,980 --> 01:04:57,599
being told this and that's uncool for me

1534
01:04:55,319 --> 01:05:00,000
to stick that in the light

1535
01:04:57,599 --> 01:05:02,160
I get hate and hit pieces constantly

1536
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:04,859
written about me there's always a new

1537
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:06,599
hip piece coming out on me always it's

1538
01:05:04,859 --> 01:05:08,460
been happening for years because I bring

1539
01:05:06,599 --> 01:05:10,200
life-saving information out there out

1540
01:05:08,460 --> 01:05:12,599
there to everybody and it goes against

1541
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:15,119
the money and the trends

1542
01:05:12,599 --> 01:05:16,859
but that's really really

1543
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:19,260
annoying

1544
01:05:16,859 --> 01:05:21,299
when I read that part

1545
01:05:19,260 --> 01:05:23,220
to the world of the microdosing money

1546
01:05:21,299 --> 01:05:25,440
world oh it's all free

1547
01:05:23,220 --> 01:05:27,299
microdosing is all free all those

1548
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:29,099
psychedelics is all free everything's

1549
01:05:27,299 --> 01:05:30,839
free no it's a money it's an industry

1550
01:05:29,099 --> 01:05:33,180
the micro dosing industry is a money

1551
01:05:30,839 --> 01:05:35,040
industry so when I say this right here

1552
01:05:33,180 --> 01:05:37,020
the line that they feed

1553
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:38,819
everybody to get them to do micro dosing

1554
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:40,500
when I say that I'm not supposed to say

1555
01:05:38,819 --> 01:05:42,799
that because it's just uncool for me to

1556
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:42,799
say it

1557
01:05:43,020 --> 01:05:46,220
but it's the truth

1558
01:05:49,799 --> 01:05:53,700
I wish SOC sometimes doesn't put things

1559
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:57,180
like that in there because then I get

1560
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:59,640
more stuff more hate but SOC said it's

1561
01:05:57,180 --> 01:06:01,740
going in long-term damage is not worth

1562
01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:05,180
the trip

1563
01:06:01,740 --> 01:06:05,180

what kind of trip

1633

I like that question a lot

1634
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:17,819
not the trip that Ayahuasca takes you on

1635
01:09:14,699 --> 01:09:21,560
or psilocybins or frog poison

1636
01:09:17,819 --> 01:09:21,560
or an OD of cacao

1637
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:26,759
finding your purpose stabilizer you can

1638
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:30,600
try it if you've lost meaning with

1639
01:09:26,759 --> 01:09:34,040
anything or everything you're doing

1640
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:34,040
did you lose a meaning

1641
01:09:36,660 --> 01:09:41,400
I mean

1642
01:09:39,299 --> 01:09:42,560
I can even get hit with that a little

1643
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:45,600
bit

1644
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:47,339
you're working for God

1645
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:50,400
like so many of you do like everybody

1646
01:09:47,339 --> 01:09:52,080
right you're working for God

1647
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:55,460
and

1648
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:55,460
then some hate comes

1649
01:09:56,460 --> 01:10:01,260
to try to slow you down and he said why

1650
01:09:58,980 --> 01:10:04,500

01:10:01,260 --> 01:10:07,679
why and then you gotta reset and be like

1652
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:11,300
I know there's reasons

1653
01:10:07,679 --> 01:10:11,300

yet but you have to keep on the lookout

1663
01:10:37,739 --> 01:10:42,960
when we heal and get free of toxins and

1664
01:10:40,679 --> 01:10:45,840
toxic heavy metals and pathogens and

1665
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:47,940
we're fueling our brains and bodies with

1666
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:50,159
the right things we reconnect to our

1667
01:10:47,940 --> 01:10:52,080
soul and purpose too the purpose

1668
01:10:50,159 --> 01:10:54,239
stabilizer is really interesting though

1669
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:57,179
because it's uh

1670
01:10:54,239 --> 01:10:59,460
blend of things no one knows works

1671
01:10:57,179 --> 01:11:01,560
together it's not any berries it's

1672
01:10:59,460 --> 01:11:03,719
specific berries with the parsley it's

1673
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:08,540
information from above of how it really

1674
01:11:03,719 --> 01:11:08,540
helps it's designed to go into the brain

1675
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:15,060
and make a difference all right

1676
01:11:12,140 --> 01:11:18,020
and it's specific amounts and specific

1677
01:11:15,060 --> 01:11:18,020
ingredients

1678
01:11:23,219 --> 01:11:28,020
all right you guys I'd say we get fired

1679
01:11:25,980 --> 01:11:30,060
up did this quarter cup

1680
01:11:28,020 --> 01:11:34,219
fresh

1681
01:11:30,060 --> 01:11:34,219
or thawed blackberries

1682
01:11:34,739 --> 01:11:37,460
quarter cup

1683
01:11:39,900 --> 01:11:44,580
so these are frozen blackberries

1684
01:11:46,140 --> 01:11:50,699
they're not

1685
01:11:47,699 --> 01:11:52,820
fresh they're frozen and they're thawed

1686
01:11:50,699 --> 01:11:52,820
out

1687
01:11:55,560 --> 01:12:01,860
so letting a quarter cup of these in

1688
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:03,540
there we go

1689
01:12:01,860 --> 01:12:06,540
so a quarter cup of fresh frozen

1690
01:12:03,540 --> 01:12:06,540
raspberries

1691
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:13,159
they can be fresh or frozen I'm using

1692
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:13,159
Frozen

1693
01:12:15,060 --> 01:12:21,600
they're thawed

1694
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:22,920
thawed frozen raspberries you gotta thaw

1695
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:25,440
them out

1696
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:27,540
if you don't thaw them out

1697
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:29,340
you're gonna have like some kind of

1698
01:12:27,540 --> 01:12:31,980
weird ice cream

1699
01:12:29,340 --> 01:12:33,960
you're making it's not gonna squeeze out

1700
01:12:31,980 --> 01:12:36,239
a lot of juice if it's if it's actually

1701
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:38,460
not thawed

1702
01:12:36,239 --> 01:12:40,020
so I'm sorry if I haven't said that so

1703
01:12:38,460 --> 01:12:42,199
I'm putting both these quarter cups in

1704
01:12:40,020 --> 01:12:42,199
here

1705
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:46,219
okay

1706
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:51,739
next is quarter cup of thawed frozen

1707
01:12:49,020 --> 01:12:51,739
strawberries

1708
01:12:54,120 --> 01:13:01,640
and I'm trying not to make a mess today

1709
01:12:56,540 --> 01:13:01,640
because I tend to make a mess

1710
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:05,420
is what I do

1711
01:13:06,659 --> 01:13:11,940
I don't know about you guys but I

1712
01:13:08,940 --> 01:13:15,980
actually do make messes

1713
01:13:11,940 --> 01:13:15,980
and then a quarter cup of tightly packed

1714
01:13:16,260 --> 01:13:20,400
and I'm listen I'm mixing the blueberry

1715
01:13:18,780 --> 01:13:22,500
powder though in the end in this

1716
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:24,360
situation

1717
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:26,460
so now I'm going to use some blueberry

1718
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:27,600
powder you can use fresh or thawed wild

1719
01:13:26,460 --> 01:13:29,400
blueberries

1720
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:30,840
but I'm using blueberry powder I'm going

1721
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:33,179
to mix in

1722
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:35,940
later

1723
01:13:33,179 --> 01:13:37,679
so what I'm doing is the berries

1724
01:13:35,940 --> 01:13:38,820
especially when they're frozen they take

1725
01:13:37,679 --> 01:13:41,659
a little time and I'm going to run some

1726
01:13:38,820 --> 01:13:41,659
parsley and now

1727
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:46,620
this juicer is incredible because you

1728
01:13:44,820 --> 01:13:49,440
would have to use a lot

1729
01:13:46,620 --> 01:13:53,400
of berries to run through

1730
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:55,920
a juicer to get the juice out of berries

1731
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:59,280
and what I love about the juicer is it

1732
01:13:55,920 --> 01:14:02,880
actually squeezes so much so there's a

1733
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:06,679
lot of compression but it's so worth it

1734
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:06,679
so I'm going to put some parsley in here

1735
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:10,820
we go

1736
01:14:17,940 --> 01:14:23,420
these parsleys have big stems so I'm

1737
01:14:20,159 --> 01:14:23,420
kind of putting it stem down

1738
01:14:24,659 --> 01:14:29,880
there we go

1739
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:32,960
and if you tightly pack these you just

1740
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:32,960
need a little bit more here

1741
01:14:35,159 --> 01:14:39,920
let me get these down in here

1742
01:14:37,260 --> 01:14:39,920
there you go

1743
01:14:42,179 --> 01:14:46,920
put this last one in here

1744
01:14:44,219 --> 01:14:50,719
now this is your purpose stabilizer

1745
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:50,719
finding your purpose stabilizers

1746
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:54,140
there we go

1747
01:14:57,239 --> 01:14:59,900
fantastic

1748
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:07,400
so I'm just squeezing a little bit more

1749
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:07,400
juice out of here

1750
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:14,960
now you'll find the pulp is really

1751
01:15:11,460 --> 01:15:14,960
extra dry with berries

1752
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:23,640
Lucas

1753
01:15:20,580 --> 01:15:26,159
Lucas Thompson down there

1754
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:28,699
you demonize psychedelics and push this

1755
01:15:26,159 --> 01:15:28,699
garbage

1756
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:33,420
foreign garbage

1757
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:37,040
really

1758
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:42,900
is parsley garbage

1759
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:44,580
Lucas Thompson says don't buy into it

1760
01:15:42,900 --> 01:15:46,940
ladies

1761
01:15:44,580 --> 01:15:50,420
there's Frozen blackberries and

1762
01:15:46,940 --> 01:15:50,420
raspberries garbage

1763
01:15:51,300 --> 01:15:55,440
I'm just confused here

1764
01:15:53,699 --> 01:15:57,179
kind of confused at that one do you have

1765
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:59,340
a better comment do you have a better

1766
01:15:57,179 --> 01:16:01,440
hateful comment

1767
01:15:59,340 --> 01:16:03,719
this Lucas can you give me another

1768
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:05,760
comment that I can actually understand a

1769
01:16:03,719 --> 01:16:07,739
little bit like maybe some other hateful

1770
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:09,540
one

1771
01:16:07,739 --> 01:16:11,400
if you got another one is what I'm

1772
01:16:09,540 --> 01:16:12,659
trying to say because that one really

1773
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:14,580
sucked

1774
01:16:12,659 --> 01:16:16,500
because it's hard for me to kind of even

1775
01:16:14,580 --> 01:16:18,960
go along with that one for fun because

1776
01:16:16,500 --> 01:16:21,480
parsley

1777
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:24,780
is incredible plant medicine

1778
01:16:21,480 --> 01:16:28,020
and berries are unbelievable for our

1779
01:16:24,780 --> 01:16:30,480
health so if you say that I demonized

1780
01:16:28,020 --> 01:16:32,100
psychedelics but push this garbage throw

1781
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:33,780
another comment I'm just waiting to see

1782
01:16:32,100 --> 01:16:34,679
if it comes up like you got something

1783
01:16:33,780 --> 01:16:37,860
else

1784
01:16:34,679 --> 01:16:40,080
call me ugly or something I don't know

1785
01:16:37,860 --> 01:16:42,260
something that's like a better one than

1786
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:42,260
that

1787
01:16:43,679 --> 01:16:47,460
I don't know

1788
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:49,739
I'm just saying

1789
01:16:47,460 --> 01:16:51,000
right so what I'm doing is with this I'm

1790
01:16:49,739 --> 01:16:53,760
gonna

1791
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:55,440
what I love about the screens

1792
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:57,420
if you have a strain or a screen with

1793
01:16:55,440 --> 01:17:00,300
this one you can just kind of like

1794
01:16:57,420 --> 01:17:03,420
massage what's left through

1795
01:17:00,300 --> 01:17:06,020

01:19:37,620 --> 01:19:41,940
ask your doctor if the psychedelics are

1855
01:19:39,480 --> 01:19:43,739
right for you

1856
01:19:41,940 --> 01:19:45,659

1857
01:19:43,739 --> 01:19:48,440

1858
01:19:45,659 --> 01:19:48,440
psychedelic use

blueberry powder

1901
01:21:26,940 --> 01:21:29,940
foreign

1902
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:37,560
says there are many scientific studies

1903
01:21:34,500 --> 01:21:40,920
and trials being done at the prestigious

1904
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:43,620
colleges such as Stanford University

1905
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:46,980
that are showing no adverse effects and

1906
01:21:43,620 --> 01:21:48,960
very successful results look it up don't

1907
01:21:46,980 --> 01:21:51,320
just take this guy's word for absolute

1908
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:51,320
truth

1909
01:21:52,739 --> 01:21:57,600
do your own research

1910
01:21:55,020 --> 01:22:00,360
huh

1911
01:21:57,600 --> 01:22:02,640
so you mean that science has never made

1912
01:22:00,360 --> 01:22:04,860
a mistake before

1913
01:22:02,640 --> 01:22:07,560
that's interesting

1914
01:22:04,860 --> 01:22:10,940
didn't science make the hugest mistake

1915
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:10,940
in just the last couple of years

1916
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:16,620
science like I I'm confused the science

1917
01:22:14,340 --> 01:22:19,320
never makes a mistake because

1918
01:22:16,620 --> 01:22:21,960
I thought science was Some Humans they

1919
01:22:19,320 --> 01:22:25,500
were doing trial and era with air with

1920
01:22:21,960 --> 01:22:28,260
theories and then science then

1921
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:30,120
crushes that scientific study and then

1922
01:22:28,260 --> 01:22:31,440
crushes that scientific study and then

1923
01:22:30,120 --> 01:22:32,880
they're wrong there then they're wrong

1924
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:35,179
there then they're wrong there it's each

1925
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:39,000
hypotheses over and over and over again

1926
01:22:35,179 --> 01:22:40,080
I didn't know science like was the

1927
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,760
end-all

1928
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:44,040
that's great

1929
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:45,000
now that I know it I was educated that

1930
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:47,159
science

1931
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:48,780
can never be wrong

1932
01:22:47,159 --> 01:22:50,760
my God they're doing studies on

1933
01:22:48,780 --> 01:22:52,199
psychedelics oh then I better run out

1934
01:22:50,760 --> 01:22:54,120
and get some psychedelics because

1935
01:22:52,199 --> 01:22:55,920
science is studying them

1936
01:22:54,120 --> 01:22:59,780
whoa

1937
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:59,780

doesn't put

1955
01:23:40,580 --> 01:23:46,140
anti-bonding or anti

1956
01:23:44,100 --> 01:23:48,060
caking agents

1957
01:23:46,140 --> 01:23:51,840
see that that's how incredible the

1958
01:23:48,060 --> 01:23:53,820
company is the only one that I know of

1959
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:56,520
that doesn't put anti-caking and

1960
01:23:53,820 --> 01:23:58,620
anti-bonding agents in here get guess

1961
01:23:56,520 --> 01:24:00,179
what all the green powders out there and

1962
01:23:58,620 --> 01:24:01,679
all the different powders

1963
01:24:00,179 --> 01:24:03,719

1964
01:24:01,679 --> 01:24:06,300
powders right all the mushroom powders

1965
01:24:03,719 --> 01:24:10,199
all the green powders

1966
01:24:06,300 --> 01:24:13,860
there's undisclosed hidden caking a

1967
01:24:10,199 --> 01:24:17,520
anti-caking agents and anti-bonding

1968
01:24:13,860 --> 01:24:19,800
agents inside those powders undisclosed

1969
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:22,040
and not on the ingredient list right

1970
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:22,040
here

1971
01:24:22,920 --> 01:24:26,719
and this is why I endorse these guys

1972
01:24:26,940 --> 01:24:31,020
never do this

1973
01:24:28,380 --> 01:24:33,179
this is incredible the only company I

1974
01:24:31,020 --> 01:24:35,640
know so far

1975
01:24:33,179 --> 01:24:37,320
that doesn't use the anti-bonding and

1976
01:24:35,640 --> 01:24:39,420
anti-caking agents that you don't know

1977
01:24:37,320 --> 01:24:40,980
you eat because if they don't they don't

1978
01:24:39,420 --> 01:24:42,060
list they're allowed to not list it on

1979
01:24:40,980 --> 01:24:45,120
the label

1980
01:24:42,060 --> 01:24:46,679
and Bemidji I want to see a clump once

1981
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:49,020
in a while and sometimes you won't see

1982
01:24:46,679 --> 01:24:50,219
clumps it's just so fresh but it's

1983
01:24:49,020 --> 01:24:52,800
incredible

1984
01:24:50,219 --> 01:24:56,040
Wren says my son loves the comps he

1985
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:58,100
thinks they are like candies

1986
01:24:56,040 --> 01:25:02,540
foreign

1987
01:24:58,100 --> 01:25:02,540
says as a scientist I believe in you

1988
01:25:14,640 --> 01:25:18,480
Lucas

1989
01:25:16,679 --> 01:25:20,699
you there

1990
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:22,500
a few okay

1991
01:25:20,699 --> 01:25:24,360
hey

1992
01:25:22,500 --> 01:25:26,760
um there was a scientist

1993
01:25:24,360 --> 01:25:29,100
right here commenting and says he

1994
01:25:26,760 --> 01:25:31,860
believes in me

1995
01:25:29,100 --> 01:25:33,300
and the person is a scientist

1996
01:25:31,860 --> 01:25:36,420
yeah

1997
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:38,640
so kind of take that for a second

1998
01:25:36,420 --> 01:25:40,800
put that in your Bonnet that feather in

1999
01:25:38,640 --> 01:25:41,940
your cap there or however you want to

2000
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:43,440
see it

2001
01:25:41,940 --> 01:25:44,699
that doesn't make sense Feathering your

2002
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:48,540
cap

2003
01:25:44,699 --> 01:25:50,880
listen Lucas not only that

2004
01:25:48,540 --> 01:25:53,159
right someone said that scientists at

2005
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:54,719
Stanford are working on psychedelic

2006
01:25:53,159 --> 01:25:55,620
research and that I should read the

2007
01:25:54,719 --> 01:25:57,719
study

2008
01:25:55,620 --> 01:26:01,139
and I had a scientist on here a second

2009
01:25:57,719 --> 01:26:02,880
ago that just said he believes in me

2010
01:26:01,139 --> 01:26:06,730
yeah

2011
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:08,760
well you're welcome bye

2012
01:26:06,730 --> 01:26:10,440
[Music]

2013
01:26:08,760 --> 01:26:11,639
anyway I just put the wild blueberry

2014
01:26:10,440 --> 01:26:13,679
powder in here I was just telling you

2015
01:26:11,639 --> 01:26:15,420
and you guys know why I endorse these

2016
01:26:13,679 --> 01:26:17,639
guys and that's one of the reasons which

2017
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:19,800
is

2018
01:26:17,639 --> 01:26:21,420
unbelievable

2019
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:24,480
and that's the difference we're talking

2020
01:26:21,420 --> 01:26:26,040
about no hidden undisclosed

2021
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:27,840
people don't realize this they don't

2022
01:26:26,040 --> 01:26:30,179
know what this is they don't know that

2023
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:31,980
when all the green powders all the fruit

2024
01:26:30,179 --> 01:26:33,600
and vegetable powders all of the

2025
01:26:31,980 --> 01:26:35,840
mushroom powders all the greens green

2026
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:38,040
powders all the powders

2027
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:39,780
undisclosed hidden caking agent

2028
01:26:38,040 --> 01:26:42,840
anti-kanking engine I can't say that

2029
01:26:39,780 --> 01:26:44,580
anti-taking agents and bonding agents

2030
01:26:42,840 --> 01:26:46,820
say that like four times in a row really

2031
01:26:44,580 --> 01:26:46,820
quick

2032
01:26:47,100 --> 01:26:50,300
they don't use that

2033
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:58,139
Cindy Layman says Lehman says the

2034
01:26:56,159 --> 01:27:01,080
massive f up

2035
01:26:58,139 --> 01:27:04,460
that was the last three years is brought

2036
01:27:01,080 --> 01:27:07,460
to you by the science laugh out loud

2037
01:27:04,460 --> 01:27:09,960
Cindy yeah but science knows everything

2038
01:27:07,460 --> 01:27:11,520
holding the light I'm a scientist too

2039
01:27:09,960 --> 01:27:14,460

got a couple of minutes

2130

and I'm reading

2131
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:40,739
and I'm reading your Soul's gold

2132
01:31:38,040 --> 01:31:44,340
since gold was discovered

2133
01:31:40,739 --> 01:31:47,880
it has had a magnetic pull on us one

2134
01:31:44,340 --> 01:31:49,739
that goes far beyond any monetary worth

2135
01:31:47,880 --> 01:31:52,500
as a child

2136
01:31:49,739 --> 01:31:54,600
did you ever wish for a gold star on

2137
01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:56,639
your paper at school

2138
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:59,340
I did

2139
01:31:56,639 --> 01:32:01,920
I never got a gold star

2140
01:31:59,340 --> 01:32:04,080
because I'm not a genius

2141
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:06,239
as a child did you ever wish for a gold

2142
01:32:04,080 --> 01:32:08,699
star on your paper at school

2143
01:32:06,239 --> 01:32:10,679
it wasn't because

2144
01:32:08,699 --> 01:32:14,699
you could take it

2145
01:32:10,679 --> 01:32:17,699
to the pawn shop and get cash for it

2146
01:32:14,699 --> 01:32:19,699
you yearned for that cheap sticker

2147
01:32:17,699 --> 01:32:24,440
because of what it represented

2148
01:32:19,699 --> 01:32:24,440
achievement worthiness approval

2149
01:32:28,440 --> 01:32:33,300
as a child did you ever wish

2150
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:35,219
for that gold star

2151
01:32:33,300 --> 01:32:37,980
because it was like

2152
01:32:35,219 --> 01:32:40,340
you did good there was something about

2153
01:32:37,980 --> 01:32:40,340
it

2154
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:44,639
if you have a grandmother's favorite

2155
01:32:42,719 --> 01:32:46,739
locket or ring

2156
01:32:44,639 --> 01:32:49,980
again

2157
01:32:46,739 --> 01:32:52,560
it's not the dollar figure behind that

2158
01:32:49,980 --> 01:32:54,719
gold that gives it a special place in

2159
01:32:52,560 --> 01:33:00,239
your heart it's the spiritual meaning

2160
01:32:54,719 --> 01:33:03,000
appreciation Nostalgia loyalty love

2161
01:33:00,239 --> 01:33:07,340
and do Olympians go for the gold because

2162
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:07,340
of the market value of the metal

2163
01:33:07,679 --> 01:33:13,860
do Olympian athletes take their gold

2164
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:15,679
medal to the pawn shop no they spend

2165
01:33:13,860 --> 01:33:18,540
their whole lives training to win

2166
01:33:15,679 --> 01:33:21,900
because of what the price stands for

2167
01:33:18,540 --> 01:33:23,460
blood sweat tears Spirit Will and

2168
01:33:21,900 --> 01:33:27,420
tension

2169
01:33:23,460 --> 01:33:30,120
and sacrifice that come together into a

2170
01:33:27,420 --> 01:33:33,420
moment of human greatness

2171
01:33:30,120 --> 01:33:35,280
when spiritual and emotional meaning are

2172
01:33:33,420 --> 01:33:38,940
connected

2173
01:33:35,280 --> 01:33:43,260
to a piece of gold or other treasure

2174
01:33:38,940 --> 01:33:46,199
its worth is on a level above price tags

2175
01:33:43,260 --> 01:33:49,380
the Knights Templar went searching for

2176
01:33:46,199 --> 01:33:53,040
the Holy Grail not because of the money

2177
01:33:49,380 --> 01:33:55,860
they would get for this gold vessel

2178
01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:59,159
but because of the mystical significance

2179
01:33:55,860 --> 01:34:04,040
it was said to hold as the cup Jesus

2180
01:33:59,159 --> 01:34:04,040
Christ drank from at the Last Supper

2181
01:34:04,920 --> 01:34:11,219
though the knights turned up hundreds

2182
01:34:07,679 --> 01:34:14,100
and hundreds of gold cups

2183
01:34:11,219 --> 01:34:17,040
they were cast off as worthless because

2184
01:34:14,100 --> 01:34:19,380
they didn't hold the power it was all

2185
01:34:17,040 --> 01:34:22,440
about the spiritual meaning the gold

2186
01:34:19,380 --> 01:34:24,860
cups weren't the cup Jesus Christ drank

2187
01:34:22,440 --> 01:34:24,860

Soul's gold

2202
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:12,480

carry inside of you

2204

yes you

2205
01:35:15,120 --> 01:35:19,739
I know it's been a struggle to deal with

2206
01:35:17,340 --> 01:35:21,120
health problems or great loss or

2207
01:35:19,739 --> 01:35:23,219
hardship

2208
01:35:21,120 --> 01:35:25,860
I understand where you might have

2209
01:35:23,219 --> 01:35:29,179
suffered as you wondered if you were

2210
01:35:25,860 --> 01:35:29,179
aging before your time

2211
01:35:31,440 --> 01:35:36,780
if you thought you were calling it quits

2212
01:35:33,540 --> 01:35:40,100
and if your body was giving up on you or

2213
01:35:36,780 --> 01:35:40,100
even working against you

2214
01:35:40,139 --> 01:35:46,280
I can only imagine what you've gone

2215
01:35:42,239 --> 01:35:46,280
through in your search for answers

2216
01:35:48,060 --> 01:35:53,040

01:35:58,500 --> 01:36:04,800
it's not your fault

2220
01:36:01,440 --> 01:36:07,320
you didn't deserve any of it

2221
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:09,000
you didn't create your illness or

2222
01:36:07,320 --> 01:36:11,940
imagine it

2223
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:16,219
you're not a bad person

2224
01:36:11,940 --> 01:36:16,219
you can heal and move forward

2225
01:36:17,699 --> 01:36:22,320
all that time that symptoms were

2226
01:36:20,159 --> 01:36:25,500
limiting you

2227
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:28,320
they were giving you something too

2228
01:36:25,500 --> 01:36:29,460
that compassion you gained from being

2229
01:36:28,320 --> 01:36:33,239
vulnerable

2230
01:36:29,460 --> 01:36:36,659
that wisdom that came from watching life

2231
01:36:33,239 --> 01:36:39,960
at a distance that faith

2232
01:36:36,659 --> 01:36:42,480
that there had to be an answer

2233
01:36:39,960 --> 01:36:45,780
that Supreme patient

2234
01:36:42,480 --> 01:36:47,340
patience of putting one foot in front of

2235
01:36:45,780 --> 01:36:49,679
the other

2236
01:36:47,340 --> 01:36:50,880
these are yours to use for the rest of

2237
01:36:49,679 --> 01:36:52,679
your life

2238
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:57,360
losses

2239
01:36:52,679 --> 01:36:59,179
struggles wounds suffering pain

2240
01:36:57,360 --> 01:37:03,020
sorrow fear

2241
01:36:59,179 --> 01:37:04,679
hardships trials

2242
01:37:03,020 --> 01:37:09,239
letdowns

2243
01:37:04,679 --> 01:37:11,760
and battles are not are not what any of

2244
01:37:09,239 --> 01:37:13,920
us would choose

2245
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:15,600
when they visit us

2246
01:37:13,920 --> 01:37:20,840
no

2247
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:20,840
we get our greatest tools and treasures

2248
01:37:21,960 --> 01:37:28,199
those tools and treasures can be heavy

2249
01:37:25,920 --> 01:37:31,080
to be in touch with the world suffering

2250
01:37:28,199 --> 01:37:33,960
is not easy just like a bag of diamonds

2251
01:37:31,080 --> 01:37:36,360
and gold it can weigh you down which is

2252
01:37:33,960 --> 01:37:38,820
why it's time for you to come into the

2253
01:37:36,360 --> 01:37:41,460
spiritual significance of your

2254
01:37:38,820 --> 01:37:44,940
challenges because when you attach

2255
01:37:41,460 --> 01:37:48,840
spiritual meaning to your Treasures

2256
01:37:44,940 --> 01:37:51,739
it makes them light as light

2257
01:37:48,840 --> 01:37:51,739
itself

2258
01:37:52,139 --> 01:37:59,040
you've been picked out of the crowd as a

2259
01:37:55,560 --> 01:38:01,920
special person who can change the world

2260
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:03,540
because you hold power

2261
01:38:01,920 --> 01:38:06,300
illness

2262
01:38:03,540 --> 01:38:08,400
try to hold you back

2263
01:38:06,300 --> 01:38:10,560
you probably experienced symptoms along

2264
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:12,960
the way and this may have gotten you

2265
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:16,080
labeled with a whole bunch of different

2266
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:16,860
names for what was supposedly wrong with

2267
01:38:16,080 --> 01:38:20,159
you

2268
01:38:16,860 --> 01:38:22,020
yet the plan of you being picked on

2269
01:38:20,159 --> 01:38:24,600
backfired

2270
01:38:22,020 --> 01:38:27,120
instead of being constrained

2271
01:38:24,600 --> 01:38:29,420
you were pushed forward and forced to

2272
01:38:27,120 --> 01:38:33,179
grow and develop in your soul and spirit

2273
01:38:29,420 --> 01:38:36,980
you gained understandings and insights

2274
01:38:33,179 --> 01:38:36,980
that brought you closer to God

2275
01:38:37,080 --> 01:38:40,260
that's your Soul's gold right there and

2276
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:42,179
thyroid healing

2277
01:38:40,260 --> 01:38:44,580
that has tremendous meaning in my life

2278
01:38:42,179 --> 01:38:46,679
and I hope in yours my blueberry dreams

2279
01:38:44,580 --> 01:38:48,540
on IG says aw the Betrayal and broken

2280
01:38:46,679 --> 01:38:51,300
trust shot

2281
01:38:48,540 --> 01:38:54,840
has helped me cook

2282
01:38:51,300 --> 01:38:56,639
my brain down and stop getting stuck on

2283
01:38:54,840 --> 01:38:58,679
thoughts about the people that have

2284
01:38:56,639 --> 01:39:01,440
disappointed me in my life

2285
01:38:58,679 --> 01:39:04,440
not even therapy could help this

2286
01:39:01,440 --> 01:39:06,980
it's gonna make me get emotional not

2287
01:39:04,440 --> 01:39:06,980
that one

2288
01:39:07,199 --> 01:39:12,000
Tammy says

2289
01:39:09,060 --> 01:39:13,320
clinical trials often times contradict

2290
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:16,020
each other

2291
01:39:13,320 --> 01:39:18,659
they always do

2292
01:39:16,020 --> 01:39:20,460
that was me adding they always do you

2293
01:39:18,659 --> 01:39:22,500
say clinical trials will back up what

2294
01:39:20,460 --> 01:39:24,739
you're saying question mark I bet at the

2295
01:39:22,500 --> 01:39:27,600
same time you can find clinical studies

2296
01:39:24,739 --> 01:39:31,380
that won't back up what you are saying

2297
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:33,239
exactly I remember many years ago

2298
01:39:31,380 --> 01:39:35,520
studies where Garlic's good for you

2299
01:39:33,239 --> 01:39:37,620
Garlic's bad for you Garlic's good for

2300
01:39:35,520 --> 01:39:38,820
you Garlic's bad for you studies saying

2301
01:39:37,620 --> 01:39:42,320
Garlic's good for you again nope still

2302
01:39:38,820 --> 01:39:42,320
you say Garlic's bad for you what is it

2303
01:39:42,600 --> 01:39:47,400
Aurora says these 20 challenge days is a

2304
01:39:45,780 --> 01:39:50,159
retreat for me

2305
01:39:47,400 --> 01:39:54,440
and did not need to spend

2306
01:39:50,159 --> 01:39:54,440
any money in luxury hotels

2307
01:39:56,159 --> 01:40:01,800

2308
01:39:59,699 --> 01:40:04,860

2309
01:40:01,800 --> 01:40:06,360

just uh

2323
01:40:42,300 --> 01:40:47,280
things about Dr Nesbitt is he

2324
01:40:45,120 --> 01:40:48,960
he self-medicates that I don't think

2325
01:40:47,280 --> 01:40:50,699
it's a good idea I tell him it's not a

2326
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:52,260
good idea but he is a surgeon and he is

2327
01:40:50,699 --> 01:40:54,360
a doctor so I don't I can't tell him

2328
01:40:52,260 --> 01:40:58,219
what to do you can't tell Dr Nesbitt

2329
01:40:54,360 --> 01:40:58,219

2330
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:03,480

2335
01:41:08,820 --> 01:41:15,120
Dr Nancy doesn't agree in micro dosing

2336
01:41:11,460 --> 01:41:17,460
he says he as a doctor he thinks it's a

2337
01:41:15,120 --> 01:41:19,920
bad idea

2338
01:41:17,460 --> 01:41:24,719
yeah but you gotta tell them what you do

2339
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:28,980
Dr Nesbit is gonna tell you what he does

2340
01:41:24,719 --> 01:41:30,719
Dr Nesbit doesn't visit his doctors in

2341
01:41:28,980 --> 01:41:33,420
his Clinic anymore because they're

2342
01:41:30,719 --> 01:41:35,340
always trying to give him what he thinks

2343
01:41:33,420 --> 01:41:37,699
is Direction that's not suitable for him

2344
01:41:35,340 --> 01:41:40,139
being he's a surgeon and a certified

2345
01:41:37,699 --> 01:41:42,600
psychiatrist he says he's been

2346
01:41:40,139 --> 01:41:44,280
prescribing himself medication so he's

2347
01:41:42,600 --> 01:41:46,380
one of those doctors he prescribes

2348
01:41:44,280 --> 01:41:48,719

01:41:59,520 --> 01:42:03,300
not going to talk about it anymore he'd

2357
01:42:01,440 --> 01:42:05,699

and he started spitting all the dirt out

2410
01:44:02,940 --> 01:44:07,440
of his mouth onto that person on the

2411
01:44:04,739 --> 01:44:11,100
ground and then another person at the

2412
01:44:07,440 --> 01:44:12,900
Psychedelic Gathering jumped up

2413
01:44:11,100 --> 01:44:15,300
grabbed him

2414
01:44:12,900 --> 01:44:17,699
dragged him down to the pond

2415
01:44:15,300 --> 01:44:20,340
and threw him in in hopes that the water

2416
01:44:17,699 --> 01:44:21,540
at the pond would wake him up out of his

2417
01:44:20,340 --> 01:44:24,360
trip

2418
01:44:21,540 --> 01:44:26,520
Dr Nesbitt said in the end they said it

2419
01:44:24,360 --> 01:44:29,760
was a spiritual journey

2420
01:44:26,520 --> 01:44:32,760
the person who got injured on the ground

2421
01:44:29,760 --> 01:44:36,119
that the patient jumped on

2422
01:44:32,760 --> 01:44:38,760
that person set was told

2423
01:44:36,119 --> 01:44:40,320
at the Psychedelic Gathering that it was

2424
01:44:38,760 --> 01:44:42,840
just her journey

2425
01:44:40,320 --> 01:44:45,239
and not to worry if

2426
01:44:42,840 --> 01:44:48,900
his patient jumped on her

2427
01:44:45,239 --> 01:44:51,480
and shoved the Toad's body in her mouth

2428
01:44:48,900 --> 01:44:54,540
and she almost choked to death

2429
01:44:51,480 --> 01:44:56,280
and she hurt her shoulder really bad and

2430
01:44:54,540 --> 01:44:57,659
everybody at the Ayahuasca Gathering

2431
01:44:56,280 --> 01:44:59,100
said that it was just part of the

2432
01:44:57,659 --> 01:45:00,960
spiritual journey and it'll give

2433
01:44:59,100 --> 01:45:01,980
everybody spiritual give her spiritual

2434
01:45:00,960 --> 01:45:04,980
growth

2435
01:45:01,980 --> 01:45:09,300
Julie B Lee says he's making stuff up

2436
01:45:04,980 --> 01:45:12,179
left and right fake news for sure

2437
01:45:09,300 --> 01:45:15,060
Dr Nesbitt is insulted

2438
01:45:12,179 --> 01:45:17,940
Dr Nesbitt doesn't make anything up Dr

2439
01:45:15,060 --> 01:45:20,060
Nesbitt is a certified surgeon

2440
01:45:17,940 --> 01:45:23,699
and Dr Nesbit is a certified

2441
01:45:20,060 --> 01:45:26,639
psychiatrist and he's telling a story

2442
01:45:23,699 --> 01:45:32,000
I'm sorry G lay B

2443
01:45:26,639 --> 01:45:32,000
that you don't like Dr nesbitt's story

2444
01:45:32,040 --> 01:45:38,159
yeah no I know that person was probably

2445
01:45:34,560 --> 01:45:40,739
at the same place I know I know

2446
01:45:38,159 --> 01:45:42,780
Dr Elizabeth says it actually happened

2447
01:45:40,739 --> 01:45:44,580
sorry to say that but it actually

2448
01:45:42,780 --> 01:45:46,800
happened

2449
01:45:44,580 --> 01:45:49,080
um anyway let's make a long story short

2450
01:45:46,800 --> 01:45:52,699
Dr Nesbitt says

2451
01:45:49,080 --> 01:45:52,699
the woman who was injured

2452
01:45:52,980 --> 01:45:59,179
um woke up the next morning

2453
01:45:55,080 --> 01:45:59,179
had a really bad rash on her face

2454
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:04,860
and a really bad sore throat

2455
01:46:02,159 --> 01:46:05,639
and went home that day early before the

2456
01:46:04,860 --> 01:46:07,320
next

2457
01:46:05,639 --> 01:46:10,679
ayahuasca

2458
01:46:07,320 --> 01:46:12,600
Gathering was going to happen that night

2459
01:46:10,679 --> 01:46:17,580
oh my God

2460
01:46:12,600 --> 01:46:20,580
one crazed Dyer says one one craze

2461
01:46:17,580 --> 01:46:24,360
doctor says

2462
01:46:20,580 --> 01:46:27,360
well sir one crazy

2463
01:46:24,360 --> 01:46:29,520
Dre says the catchphrase your spiritual

2464
01:46:27,360 --> 01:46:31,199
journey has become the new Trust of

2465
01:46:29,520 --> 01:46:32,699
science

2466
01:46:31,199 --> 01:46:35,400
um that's actually ingenious and that's

2467
01:46:32,699 --> 01:46:37,800
brilliant and that's true

2468
01:46:35,400 --> 01:46:39,840
Dr nesbit's not happy about that though

2469
01:46:37,800 --> 01:46:40,980
because Dr Nas Dr Nesbit is all about

2470
01:46:39,840 --> 01:46:42,360
science

2471
01:46:40,980 --> 01:46:43,500

you know medical meme information is

2519
01:48:35,940 --> 01:48:40,260

influencers change by the week and the

2525
01:48:47,280 --> 01:48:51,179
month and the year they got more colors

2526
01:48:49,199 --> 01:48:53,400
than chameleons that can change their

2527
01:48:51,179 --> 01:48:54,780

then they're doing another then they're

2529
01:48:54,780 --> 01:48:59,159
doing another and they're doing another

2530
01:48:55,980 --> 01:49:01,199
by the way science takes medical mediums

2531
01:48:59,159 --> 01:49:04,080
information and Dr nisbet's getting

2532
01:49:01,199 --> 01:49:06,300

Elizabeth does say science is poaching

2534
01:49:06,300 --> 01:49:09,840

01:49:08,639 --> 01:49:14,219

Nesbit doesn't like the episode where we

2545
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:40,760
talk about Mike the chicken and his head

2546
01:49:38,040 --> 01:49:40,760
being chopped off

2547
01:49:41,040 --> 01:49:44,100

live that's what Dr Nesbit said

2558
01:50:03,780 --> 01:50:10,100
Dr Nesbitt I'm not going to do that I

2559
01:50:06,540 --> 01:50:10,100
would never chop a chicken set off

2560
