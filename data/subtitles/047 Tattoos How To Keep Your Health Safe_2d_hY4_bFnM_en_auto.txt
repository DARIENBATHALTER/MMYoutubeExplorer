[158.32 - 165.04] stronger or something like
[160.76 - 168.56] that as of today there are no sources of
[165.04 - 171.16] tattoo ink that are free of toxic heavy
[168.56 - 174.60] metals and as of today there are no
[171.16 - 176.28] tattoo inks free of metals but I know
[174.60 - 178.80] there's some people out there that are
[176.28 - 182.52] just going to say no way not my ink I
[178.80 - 183.32] know cuz I got the assurance that my ink
[182.52 - 186.84] was
[183.32 - 190.84] crueltyfree crueltyfree and not to
[186.84 - 192.76] mention my ink was vegan and crueltyfree
[190.84 - 194.60] so there's no way that's not my ink I'm
[192.76 - 198.44] going to listen to the show but this
[194.60 - 202.96] isn't me I repeat there are no tattoo
[198.44 - 204.16] inks available out there without metals
[202.96 - 206.36] and there's something else you might
[204.16 - 209.08] want to know there is a certain
[206.36 - 210.28] percentage of ingredients inside the
[209.08 - 213.92] tattoo ink
[210.28 - 215.60] that do not have to be exposed and do
[213.92 - 218.56] not have to be
[215.60 - 220.64] disclosed just like in food products
[218.56 - 223.08] they can have a certain small percentage
[220.64 - 224.84] of ingredients chemicals and so forth
[223.08 - 227.52] all kinds of different ingredients that
[224.84 - 228.40] do not have to be disclosed and just
[227.52 - 230.16] like
[228.40 - 232.08] supplementation same thing you could
[230.16 - 234.20] have a certain amount a certain
[232.08 - 236.52] percentage of ingredients that are
[234.20 - 238.60] hidden not disclosed to the public or
[236.52 - 240.64] the consumer that are in there and
[238.60 - 243.88] nobody knows about will tell tattoo ink
[240.64 - 245.84] is the same these days there are people
[243.88 - 247.76] out there that are really careful about
[245.84 - 250.04] what they eat careful about what they
[247.76 - 253.04] drink making sure that if they drink
[250.04 - 255.60] coffee it's the best stuff out there
[253.04 - 257.64] like they even know the Farms like there
[255.60 - 259.16] are people out there that are crazy
[257.64 - 262.12] about what's going on what they put on
[259.16 - 264.64] their body they're concerned whatever
[262.12 - 267.40] kind of cream whatever kind of facial
[264.64 - 269.76] they get whatever it is they're all
[267.40 - 272.36] about I don't put things in my body that
[269.76 - 274.72] that shouldn't be there meanwhile
[272.36 - 276.48] they'll be getting a tattoo and those
[274.72 - 279.16] are the kind of people that if they want
[276.48 - 282.00] a tattoo they're asking questions like
[279.16 - 284.12] is this tattoo good is it clean is it
[282.00 - 285.88] crueltyfree and the place they're
[284.12 - 288.88] getting it be like yeah here's our best
[285.88 - 290.80] inks here's what it is and it's like
[288.88 - 294.04] great I feel good about this put it in
[290.80 - 296.52] my body and that ink is not free of
[294.04 - 300.08] heavy metals and that ink is not free of
[296.52 - 303.24] toxins and that ink is not free of metal
[300.08 - 306.08] s is that ink better than the ink 30
[303.24 - 309.16] years ago probably is the ink better
[306.08 - 312.16] than the ink they used 50 years ago yeah
[309.16 - 315.00] definitely but how much better is it not
[312.16 - 317.68] that much better and then there's the
[315.00 - 320.12] people that are afraid to speak up no
[317.68 - 321.48] judgment no anything like that but
[320.12 - 323.76] they're afraid to speak up so they go
[321.48 - 325.80] get a tattoo they don't want to tell
[323.76 - 328.80] that tattoo artist anything they don't
[325.80 - 330.88] want to say hey can you use this ink or
[328.80 - 333.12] what's your ink made out of they're just
[330.88 - 335.72] afraid they could have been recommended
[333.12 - 337.68] to the place from a friend and there
[335.72 - 339.84] could be a huge waiting list because the
[337.68 - 342.16] tattoo artist is amazing really good at
[339.84 - 345.20] what they do they could have traveled
[342.16 - 347.08] across the country around the world
[345.20 - 349.68] could be this one guy in
[347.08 - 352.12] La this one person in La it could be
[349.68 - 354.20] anybody and they go and they're there
[352.12 - 358.28] and they're not going to say anything
[354.20 - 361.04] just sign the dotted line just put it in
[358.28 - 363.96] boom and then then there's the sanitary
[361.04 - 366.92] issues the sanitary issues that are at
[363.96 - 370.04] hand literally on the
[366.92 - 371.64] hand now I know that tattoo artists they
[370.04 - 374.16] change their gloves they're not using
[371.64 - 376.48] the same pair of gloves each person and
[374.16 - 378.72] you'll never see a tattoo artist wear
[376.48 - 381.96] white gloves and you'll never see a
[378.72 - 385.04] tattoo artist wear blue gloves they wear
[381.96 - 387.68] black gloves the reason why it'll look
[385.04 - 390.52] like a murder scene now blood is really
[387.68 - 393.84] tricky tends to get everywhere
[390.52 - 396.00] it's not even like water water doesn't
[393.84 - 399.68] get everywhere that's how crazy it is
[396.00 - 402.52] blood tends to get everywhere because
[399.68 - 405.76] blood is slippery it's got a
[402.52 - 408.00] viscosity and micro drops go everywhere
[405.76 - 410.84] so when someone's getting a tattoo the
[408.00 - 413.24] micro drops are flying you don't see
[410.84 - 417.04] them it's hard to see them they don't
[413.24 - 418.96] leave a stain but they fly now there's a
[417.04 - 422.32] good chance your tattoo artist is just
[418.96 - 425.72] going to change gloves between clients
[422.32 - 428.76] and those gloves are laced with blood
[425.72 - 432.08] the client's blood now you would think
[428.76 - 434.16] it's Flawless nothing bad could happen
[432.08 - 436.56] the guy or the girl takes off their
[434.16 - 439.28] gloves throws them away in the
[436.56 - 442.56] biowaste but if you took a blue light
[439.28 - 445.36] over everything you would see blood in
[442.56 - 447.40] weird places you would see it on the
[445.36 - 449.56] table you'd see it on the floor you'd
[447.40 - 453.08] see it on the chair you'd see it on the
[449.56 - 455.96] box they're drawing new gloves from the
[453.08 - 459.32] very box that has brand new gloves you
[455.96 - 460.64] would see it even on that box but of
[459.32 - 464.60] course you get a brand new set of
[460.64 - 467.52] needles for your tattoo and years past
[464.60 - 469.52] you wouldn't get a set of new needles it
[467.52 - 471.16] would be the same needles it would just
[469.52 - 473.32] be needles that went through a
[471.16 - 476.20] sterilizer the guy would walk up to the
[473.32 - 478.76] incubator sterilization machine open up
[476.20 - 481.48] the door pull a brand new needle out not
[478.76 - 484.44] a brand new needle out an old needle
[481.48 - 486.20] that was used before 100 times take it
[484.44 - 489.52] out say it was
[486.20 - 492.48] sterilized attach it to the gun and get
[489.52 - 495.20] to work there are millions of people
[492.48 - 497.68] that had their tattoos done that way and
[495.20 - 499.28] have transmitted a lot of different bugs
[497.68 - 503.40] because of it
[499.28 - 506.52] viruses bacteria but it's changed now
[503.40 - 509.60] it's brand new needles in brand new
[506.52 - 510.88] packages but what hasn't changed is
[509.60 - 513.60] other forms of
[510.88 - 516.40] contamination tiny blood smears tiny
[513.60 - 518.84] blood drops everywhere any friends that
[516.40 - 521.04] I have that want to get a tattoo or have
[518.84 - 523.92] tattoos and want to get another tattoo I
[521.04 - 527.24] tell them be the first client of the day
[523.92 - 529.00] don't be the second don't be the last if
[527.24 - 532.24] I was going to get a tattoo I would
[529.00 - 535.32] bring a brand new set of gloves better
[532.24 - 538.00] than that I would bring a box my own box
[535.32 - 540.24] of gloves then I would make sure I was
[538.00 - 543.20] the first person
[540.24 - 546.40] and it was after the tattoo artist had a
[543.20 - 549.20] day off this allows for any kind of germ
[546.40 - 551.32] warfare any kind of pathogens viruses
[549.20 - 553.32] bacteria that could be from other
[551.32 - 555.96] people's blood that could be left
[553.32 - 558.84] anywhere anywhere at all in the tattoo
[555.96 - 561.88] parlor gives it a chance for there to be
[558.84 - 564.68] a die off several years ago I was in a
[561.88 - 566.96] tattoo parlor with a friend my friend
[564.68 - 569.60] asked me to be there wanted me to be
[566.96 - 572.40] there while he was getting a tattoo so I
[569.60 - 575.56] was watching everything so the tattoo
[572.40 - 578.16] artist grabbed some fresh gloves put
[575.56 - 581.44] them on his hands looked at me and said
[578.16 - 583.24] is this good he was being sarcastic cuz
[581.44 - 585.68] he knew I was there to just keep an eye
[583.24 - 587.92] on things cuz my friend said so so I was
[585.68 - 590.16] watching everything he also grabbed some
[587.92 - 592.32] new needles brand new needles he opened
[590.16 - 595.52] them up and he made a joke too at the
[592.32 - 598.12] same time but he grabbed the new needles
[595.52 - 600.24] unpackaged them put them in the gun he
[598.12 - 604.08] also told me how much he s paralyzed the
[600.24 - 606.32] place he started to work on my friend he
[604.08 - 608.68] was doing the tattoo everything was
[606.32 - 613.04] going pretty good I was sitting there
[608.68 - 616.56] okay not bad and then I saw him he took
[613.04 - 620.32] his right hand and He adjusted his stool
[616.56 - 623.00] there was a little handle on his stool
[620.32 - 625.28] and because each client had a different
[623.00 - 627.24] height different weight different size
[625.28 - 629.40] person he would have to get himself
[627.24 - 632.08] comfortable position himself just right
[629.40 - 636.12] and he would have to adjust his stool
[632.08 - 638.96] and then he had blood from this client
[636.12 - 641.36] which was my friend on his glove and
[638.96 - 643.76] then he reached over with the hand that
[641.36 - 646.48] had my friend's blood on it and grabbed
[643.76 - 648.12] the handle to the stool and then I said
[646.48 - 653.04] wait a
[648.12 - 654.32] minute hold on here wait a minute and I
[653.04 - 657.88] had to give a
[654.32 - 662.24] 101 to a highly experienced tattoo
[657.88 - 664.80] artist famous is in La who's worked on
[662.24 - 667.44] everybody I said was that stool
[664.80 - 670.60] sterilized and he said no I said was a
[667.44 - 673.32] handle to that stool sterilized he said
[670.60 - 676.28] no I said you touch that on every client
[673.32 - 677.68] he said yeah I told my friend this is
[676.28 - 679.84] why you got to be the first client of
[677.68 - 682.28] the day and this is why it should be
[679.84 - 684.76] after a day or two off that the tattoo
[682.28 - 686.72] artist had maybe if the tattoo artist
[684.76 - 690.00] took the weekend off then it's Monday
[686.72 - 692.96] morning first client this way way you'll
[690.00 - 696.28] have a better chance for whatever was on
[692.96 - 700.08] that stool handle could have had time to
[696.28 - 703.12] die off and this isn't Ironclad so the
[700.08 - 705.16] artist sterilized the chair sterilized a
[703.12 - 707.76] stool did some extra sterilizing
[705.16 - 711.08] everywhere else did some alcohol rubs in
[707.76 - 713.80] different places and then of course
[711.08 - 717.12] changed out the gloves and changed out
[713.80 - 718.96] the gun because he was touching the gun
[717.12 - 723.20] after touching the stool then touching
[718.96 - 725.44] the gun and put some new needles into my
[723.20 - 728.32] friend he was happy with his Polar Bear
[725.44 - 731.12] tattoo I have to admit came out freaking
[728.32 - 734.04] amazing almost made me want to get one
[731.12 - 737.36] but I didn't but I still told my friend
[734.04 - 740.76] just because the ink was crty free and
[737.36 - 743.48] vegan it didn't mean it was metal free
[740.76 - 746.00] or hidden toxin free my friend was
[743.48 - 748.24] bummed out to hear about the metal part
[746.00 - 749.88] but he was happy it was crueltyfree and
[748.24 - 753.44] I said you know that's good because they
[749.88 - 756.76] didn't experiment or torture the animals
[753.44 - 759.28] in the world to make your tattoo ink
[756.76 - 762.64] what people don't know is that without
[759.28 - 765.24] the toxic heavy metals or Metals at all
[762.64 - 769.20] inside the tattoo ink you can't get the
[765.24 - 772.36] pop the shine you need Metals inside the
[769.20 - 776.52] ink so that when the sunlight hits your
[772.36 - 778.84] skin it reflects off the metals without
[776.52 - 781.40] Metals in the ink any light hitting your
[778.84 - 783.80] skin your arm your body your back your
[781.40 - 787.08] chest your face your neck you won't be
[783.80 - 789.24] able to see the tattoo it won't be clear
[787.08 - 791.72] it won't be fresh it won't pop it won't
[789.24 - 793.88] have vibrancy you have to have Metals in
[791.72 - 796.28] there so when light hits at any kind of
[793.88 - 798.28] light the light inside your room the
[796.28 - 800.40] light inside your car the light inside a
[798.28 - 803.28] restaurant wherever the light is the
[800.40 - 806.68] light in the sky it has to hit the metal
[803.28 - 809.40] it has to reflect and then you see it
[806.68 - 812.28] that's why a brand new tattoo really
[809.40 - 815.56] pops it really showcases it really
[812.28 - 818.68] exhibits itself the newer the tattoo the
[815.56 - 821.48] better the display and then over time
[818.68 - 825.32] the tattoo fades it could take years
[821.48 - 829.52] it's very slow but it fades and as it's
[825.32 - 831.00] fading the metals are leaving that could
[829.52 - 834.52] be a good thing right the metals are
[831.00 - 836.88] leaving but wait they're not leaving
[834.52 - 839.28] they're staying they're just shifting
[836.88 - 840.76] their location they're entering your
[839.28 - 843.72] bloodstream they're entering your
[840.76 - 845.76] lymphatic system they're entering both
[843.72 - 849.16] and from there they take a nice little
[845.76 - 851.28] trip into the liver they stay in there
[849.16 - 853.88] as long as they can until they get
[851.28 - 856.52] overloaded and they leave the liver and
[853.88 - 859.08] they head to the brain as these Metals
[856.52 - 862.04] leave the Derma and they leave your
[859.08 - 864.04] tattoo it's the wild west some of the
[862.04 - 866.24] metals may not even go to your liver
[864.04 - 868.20] they'll just go straight to your brain
[866.24 - 870.96] but they never ever leave your
[868.20 - 872.76] bloodstream and leave your kidneys and
[870.96 - 875.32] leave you unless you're doing something
[872.76 - 877.48] proactive we'll talk about that later
[875.32 - 879.56] having a tattoo and having that tattoo
[877.48 - 881.68] ink in the Derma of your skin is
[879.56 - 883.68] different than drinking something like
[881.68 - 885.64] so say you drink something that has
[883.68 - 888.04] toxic heavy metals in it there might be
[885.64 - 890.00] a tiny percentage a small portion of
[888.04 - 892.52] those metals that might leave your body
[890.00 - 894.12] through your urine and the reason for
[892.52 - 896.00] that is because those metals were never
[894.12 - 897.84] in your body they never had a long time
[896.00 - 900.04] to sit inside your body they've never
[897.84 - 902.36] conformed they've never changed they've
[900.04 - 904.52] never altered while in your body they're
[902.36 - 906.88] fresh they're in the drink or something
[904.52 - 909.84] you're eating they go in your body it's
[906.88 - 912.04] brand new your body excretes some of it
[909.84 - 914.36] out keeps most of it but still excretes
[912.04 - 916.56] some of it out the metals in your
[914.36 - 920.24] tattooing though that's sitting in you
[916.56 - 922.60] for one year 5 years 10 years has
[920.24 - 925.12] started to oxidize it's not the same
[922.60 - 928.16] thing as it was when it went in you for
[925.12 - 930.96] one it has a different weight to it for
[928.16 - 933.80] two your body has identified it over the
[930.96 - 937.16] years learn to live with it your body's
[933.80 - 940.28] not in a rush to eliminate it it's not
[937.16 - 943.08] thinking it needs to your immune system
[940.28 - 946.92] has learned to coexist with it it's not
[943.08 - 950.20] in a rush or any desire to eliminate it
[946.92 - 952.64] or get rid of it or help carry it out
[950.20 - 957.08] our immune systems are designed to
[952.64 - 960.20] gobble up fresh threats fresh toxins
[957.08 - 963.16] fresh Metals things that it sees as a
[960.20 - 965.56] threat but the metals inside and the
[963.16 - 967.84] toxins inside the ink that's in your arm
[965.56 - 971.08] for a long time our immune system has
[967.84 - 973.52] learned to cohabitate with it as these
[971.08 - 976.40] oxidized Metals leech out of your Derma
[973.52 - 979.76] into your bloodstream there isn't a bell
[976.40 - 982.12] whistling there isn't a massive red flag
[979.76 - 984.20] your body's not alarmed your body has
[982.12 - 986.68] coexisted with it for a long time
[984.20 - 989.64] there's no rush to push it out there's
[986.68 - 993.28] no Avenue to send it out
[989.64 - 995.72] it's Wild West it's free it's clear and
[993.28 - 998.00] it's heading where it wants to go
[995.72 - 1000.16] another reason why your body's not in a
[998.00 - 1002.48] rush to get rid of the toxic heavy
[1000.16 - 1004.16] metals from the tattoo ink that's
[1002.48 - 1006.16] leeching out of your Derma into the
[1004.16 - 1008.76] bloodstream and another reason why your
[1006.16 - 1013.36] immune system isn't in a rush either is
[1008.76 - 1016.68] because it's been time relased slow and
[1013.36 - 1021.12] steady slow and steady and that's how it
[1016.68 - 1023.60] goes every year every day every decade a
[1021.12 - 1026.28] little bit at a time there's no alarm
[1023.60 - 1029.16] Bells being rung just a little bit at a
[1026.28 - 1033.48] time coming out and that's why the body
[1029.16 - 1036.92] is not in any any emergency or rush to
[1033.48 - 1040.00] rid it but as the years go by the tattoo
[1036.92 - 1041.80] starts to fade maybe because you're
[1040.00 - 1044.08] thinking well that's what it's supposed
[1041.80 - 1047.88] to do right supposed to fade it was done
[1044.08 - 1051.80] many years ago you grow older no it's
[1047.88 - 1055.60] supposed to be just as shiny and nice as
[1051.80 - 1057.76] the day you got it because it's not
[1055.60 - 1059.20] supposed to have metal in there it's
[1057.76 - 1061.12] supposed to have some new form of
[1059.20 - 1062.80] technology that they'll discover 30
[1061.12 - 1066.36] years down the road 50 years down the
[1062.80 - 1068.80] road that never Fades that isn't a toxic
[1066.36 - 1071.56] heavy metal something they'll create in
[1068.80 - 1074.80] a lab somewhere but right now it's the
[1071.56 - 1077.48] metals and they fade because they leave
[1074.80 - 1079.64] time relased they dissipate they go away
[1077.48 - 1082.72] as the years go on and you're left with
[1079.64 - 1085.88] a faded tattoo and as the light from the
[1082.72 - 1088.36] sun or light from the light in your room
[1085.88 - 1091.24] or light from anywhere hits your arm
[1088.36 - 1095.16] hits your leg hit your back hit your
[1091.24 - 1098.04] neck it doesn't pop anymore the metals
[1095.16 - 1101.12] are leaving it doesn't reflect against
[1098.04 - 1104.36] the metal as much anymore if you already
[1101.12 - 1106.92] have tattoos don't have to remove them
[1104.36 - 1110.28] instead you can follow medical medium
[1106.92 - 1112.44] protocols to stop up and expel the
[1110.28 - 1115.64] metals as they're being time relased out
[1112.44 - 1117.92] of your Derma into your blood and lymph
[1115.64 - 1121.16] this way over time the metals don't keep
[1117.92 - 1122.68] on building up inside your brain if
[1121.16 - 1125.04] you're somebody that doesn't like their
[1122.68 - 1127.00] tattoo anymore and they want it gone
[1125.04 - 1129.24] they want to remove it I don't recommend
[1127.00 - 1131.60] that because the procedure could release
[1129.24 - 1135.80] more toxic heavy metals more toxins into
[1131.60 - 1138.56] your blood and lymph faster heavier I
[1135.80 - 1140.72] prefer just leaving them on people keep
[1138.56 - 1143.08] them don't worry about it unless you
[1140.72 - 1144.76] really want them removed and if you do
[1143.08 - 1146.80] then really you should be following the
[1144.76 - 1150.00] heavy metal detox Guidance the medical
[1146.80 - 1153.12] medium books brain saver if anybody has
[1150.00 - 1156.56] a tattoo remember the metals slowly
[1153.12 - 1158.24] leech out of the Derma into your system
[1156.56 - 1161.40] your blood your lymph your brain your
[1158.24 - 1164.44] liver your spleen your pancreas your
[1161.40 - 1166.68] bones so it's always best to do the
[1164.44 - 1166.68] right
[1167.72 - 1172.92] protocols
[1169.44 - 1176.08] hey let we got under this hot dog stand
[1172.92 - 1178.56] just in time yeah all right all right
[1176.08 - 1181.04] just wait for the storms lightning bad
[1178.56 - 1185.16] lightning yeah the Lightning's really
[1181.04 - 1188.92] bad oh whoa you see that guy down at the
[1185.16 - 1191.16] beach yeah that guy's totally Inked Up
[1188.92 - 1194.28] he's got ink from his head down to his
[1191.16 - 1197.24] toe man he doesn't know it but he's got
[1194.28 - 1199.40] to be careful because that's metal and
[1197.24 - 1203.52] that's lightning
[1199.40 - 1205.20] yeah yeah cuz the metal it's
[1203.52 - 1206.96] industrialized that's the kind of metal
[1205.20 - 1208.40] they put in us it's different than the
[1206.96 - 1212.56] minerals and trace minerals that are in
[1208.40 - 1214.96] our body yeah oh totally he's like an
[1212.56 - 1217.68] iron Rod right now for that lightning
[1214.96 - 1220.20] bolt yeah someone's got to tell them but
[1217.68 - 1223.24] I'm I I don't know should we go out
[1220.20 - 1225.48] there let's go out there and tell them
[1223.24 - 1228.48] think the guy will get mad I don't know
[1225.48 - 1229.68] he might punch me out I don't know I'm
[1228.48 - 1232.00] going head out there and tell them to
[1229.68 - 1235.36] get get undercover
[1232.00 - 1237.64] okay something to understand that when
[1235.36 - 1241.72] we get tattoos we're putting a lot of
[1237.64 - 1244.00] metal under our skin this isn't metal
[1241.72 - 1247.24] like minerals trace minerals from the
[1244.00 - 1249.88] plants we eat from the food that we eat
[1247.24 - 1251.84] from the water we drink these are
[1249.88 - 1255.76] manufactured metals that are inside the
[1251.84 - 1257.76] tattoo inks they're destabilized they're
[1255.76 - 1260.28] industrialized it's not like the plants
[1257.76 - 1262.40] we eat the food wheat it's not the same
[1260.28 - 1264.24] trace minerals inside our body it's not
[1262.40 - 1266.64] the trace minerals that actually help us
[1264.24 - 1267.60] function it's not the electrolytes that
[1266.64 - 1269.60] are in our
[1267.60 - 1272.88] bloodstream when you're playing a game
[1269.60 - 1275.20] of golf and a thunderstorm comes and you
[1272.88 - 1277.76] see some lightning bolts in the distance
[1275.20 - 1281.36] you're holding a golf club you know you
[1277.76 - 1283.64] have to put it away and head back it's
[1281.36 - 1286.00] not that you have to be afraid or scared
[1283.64 - 1287.76] of a lightning storm thunderstorm more
[1286.00 - 1289.52] so than anybody else but it's something
[1287.76 - 1291.60] to keep in mind
[1289.52 - 1294.72] because the lightning tends to find
[1291.60 - 1297.92] metal it looks for lamp posts it looks
[1294.72 - 1301.04] for fence posts it looks for metal
[1297.92 - 1303.92] objects it looks for metal lawn chairs
[1301.04 - 1305.84] it looks for metal gates it looks for
[1303.92 - 1307.76] all kinds of different varieties of
[1305.84 - 1310.92] metal sticking out of the ground and it
[1307.76 - 1312.52] looks for metal roofs lightning tends to
[1310.92 - 1315.12] search and
[1312.52 - 1317.28] seek just like someone doesn't want to
[1315.12 - 1319.84] go into a lightning storm wrapped in
[1317.28 - 1322.28] aluminum foil you just don't want to do
[1319.84 - 1324.80] it someone doesn't want to go into a
[1322.28 - 1328.12] lightning storm holding a golf club in
[1324.80 - 1330.72] the air it's not about having fear it's
[1328.12 - 1333.28] not about being scared it's just about
[1330.72 - 1336.12] being proactive and careful lightning
[1333.28 - 1338.36] storm coming your way Thunder's going
[1336.12 - 1341.92] you see lightning bolts you got a ton of
[1338.36 - 1344.88] Ink on you and in you just be careful
[1341.92 - 1348.16] try to get cover protect yourself be
[1344.88 - 1349.60] aware be smart about it that's all these
[1348.16 - 1352.00] are just just some of the things to
[1349.60 - 1354.72] consider if you have tattoos or you plan
[1352.00 - 1356.52] on getting tattoos or you have tattoos
[1354.72 - 1359.36] and you plan on getting more
[1356.52 - 1361.84] tattoos I've been bringing awareness
[1359.36 - 1365.20] about Metals being in tattoos for
[1361.84 - 1368.36] decades now here's a recent clip of a
[1365.20 - 1371.28] social media live stream I did in 2022
[1368.36 - 1374.52] March 16th where I talk about tattoo ink
[1371.28 - 1376.96] and metals inside of it so with brain
[1374.52 - 1379.32] fog you can have metal sprinkled
[1376.96 - 1380.76] about so you're what like where do I get
[1379.32 - 1382.92] Mercury and all these metals like where
[1380.76 - 1385.12] does it come from well I noticed a lot
[1382.92 - 1387.52] of people like tattoos these days a lot
[1385.12 - 1390.08] of people like ink these days and I'm
[1387.52 - 1391.92] not against getting ink at all if you
[1390.08 - 1394.48] got ink don't get it
[1391.92 - 1397.00] removed you know I mean if you have ink
[1394.48 - 1399.60] it's fine it's fine but what people
[1397.00 - 1401.48] don't realize is that's a huge one for
[1399.60 - 1404.16] toxic heavy metals that's why the heavy
[1401.48 - 1406.12] metal detox cleanse is so important
[1404.16 - 1408.64] that's why the heavy metal detox
[1406.12 - 1413.40] smoothie is so important because it's
[1408.64 - 1414.96] that there's no heavy metal free ink so
[1413.40 - 1416.76] when you get when someone's like hey I
[1414.96 - 1420.04] know this great tattoo parlor I know
[1416.76 - 1422.80] this great tattoo artist they use
[1420.04 - 1427.60] crueltyfree ink they use animal
[1422.80 - 1430.80] crueltyfree ink it's vegan it's vegan
[1427.60 - 1432.44] ink it's filled with metal you can't
[1430.80 - 1434.72] have it any other way and I'll tell you
[1432.44 - 1437.28] why when you get your
[1434.72 - 1438.68] ink right and I'll show you this right
[1437.28 - 1440.48] here you see this Rose you you can see
[1438.68 - 1443.64] this rose up
[1440.48 - 1446.20] close the reason why you can see the
[1443.64 - 1447.76] rose on your arm when you get the ink or
[1446.20 - 1449.44] you get on your wherever you got your
[1447.76 - 1452.00] tattoo maybe you just got an inscription
[1449.44 - 1453.88] maybe you just got some wise words you
[1452.00 - 1456.72] know like some wise words written across
[1453.88 - 1458.52] maybe you got like you know the name of
[1456.72 - 1460.88] of something written somewhere whatever
[1458.52 - 1464.76] it is that you choose to get you see the
[1460.88 - 1466.84] rose it pops when light hits it right
[1464.76 - 1469.20] when it's in your arm and the only way
[1466.84 - 1472.76] that can happen is if that ink is filled
[1469.20 - 1475.96] with metal that's the reflective nature
[1472.76 - 1478.28] of the ink so what happens is when light
[1475.96 - 1480.96] goes into your
[1478.28 - 1483.20] Derma anything light any kind of light
[1480.96 - 1485.72] not sunlight any kind of light goes
[1483.20 - 1488.32] through your Derma it hits the ink and
[1485.72 - 1492.72] it reflects back
[1488.32 - 1496.04] out that's how you get that pop so when
[1492.72 - 1499.24] you walk out of a tattoo parlor and the
[1496.04 - 1502.32] dude there or whoever gave a
[1499.24 - 1504.08] tattoo they said it was animal Cru
[1502.32 - 1506.04] cruelty free ink maybe it was animal
[1504.08 - 1509.72] cruelty free free ink but it's not heavy
[1506.04 - 1512.68] metal free ink because the metals make
[1509.72 - 1515.32] it so you can see it and so here's how
[1512.68 - 1518.92] it works as the metals go into your
[1515.32 - 1520.96] bloodstream every day from there on out
[1518.92 - 1523.16] and they go to your brain over time as
[1520.96 - 1526.96] the metals travel into your bloodstream
[1523.16 - 1530.32] and get to your brain over time okay
[1526.96 - 1531.88] your your tattoo f Fades it's not fading
[1530.32 - 1534.96] because you're getting
[1531.88 - 1538.64] older it's not fading because you've had
[1534.96 - 1541.80] the tattoo for 10 years or 15 years 20
[1538.64 - 1544.36] years it's fading because all the metal
[1541.80 - 1545.72] is slowly leaving through your Derma
[1544.36 - 1548.12] that pass through your Derma into your
[1545.72 - 1551.44] bloodstream and ends up in your
[1548.12 - 1554.08] liver and ends up in your brain that's
[1551.44 - 1556.56] where it's going right and it's not
[1554.08 - 1558.56] about getting them removed it's about
[1556.56 - 1560.28] just being proactive and catching the
[1558.56 - 1562.48] metals as they're
[1560.28 - 1565.52] leaving I always tell people who are
[1562.48 - 1568.36] Inked Up heavy metal detox smoothie for

[1574.88 - 1577.72] going to be catching
[1579.33 - 1583.95] [Music]
