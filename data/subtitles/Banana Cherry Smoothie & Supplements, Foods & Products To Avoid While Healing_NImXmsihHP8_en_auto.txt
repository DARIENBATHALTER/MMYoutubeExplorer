[547.68 - 550.88] told you about this you guys

[559.92 - 563.60] jeans
[560.96 - 564.72] where someone was murdered like 40 years
[563.60 - 568.40] ago
[564.72 - 571.44] and they can take a q-tip a wet
[568.40 - 573.28] q-tip and they can sit there on the pair
[571.44 - 575.20] of jeans doing forensics
[573.28 - 577.60] and they can sit there rubbing that
[575.20 - 580.16] little piece of dried blood
[577.60 - 581.44] with a wet q-tip right where you could
[580.16 - 584.80] barely even see
[581.44 - 587.04] a stain on the q-tip
[584.80 - 587.92] they can take that and they can figure
[587.04 - 590.00] out half
[587.92 - 592.40] of what's wrong with someone as far as
[590.00 - 594.08] in our daily blood tests we do today
[592.40 - 596.80] they can get a nutritional profile from
[594.08 - 598.72] that a whole nutritional profile
[596.80 - 600.64] they can check your dna they can check
[598.72 - 604.08] where your blood sugar is
[600.64 - 607.52] 40 years later a q-tip
[604.08 - 609.04] dried okay there's a blood scam
[607.52 - 610.40] going on you guys if you haven't
[609.04 - 612.40] listened to medical mean podcast at
[610.40 - 615.12] apple podcast and listen to that one
[612.40 - 616.40] you know um laura isn't that funny laura
[615.12 - 618.08] said i can't even
[616.40 - 620.24] laura ward that's really funny i can't
[618.08 - 622.72] even i know it's crazy what they do
[620.24 - 624.24] right you can take a q-tip and get a
[622.72 - 626.88] little bit of dried blood
[624.24 - 629.28] and you can get so much information you
[626.88 - 632.24] can do a psa off of that
[629.28 - 634.32] you can do an a1c off that cholesterol
[632.24 - 637.20] you can do a cholesterol off of that
[634.32 - 638.08] 40 years later someone who was who was
[637.20 - 641.04] murdered
[638.08 - 642.96] and they found jeans in a mud pit and
[641.04 - 645.52] they pulled the genes out of a mud pit
[642.96 - 646.00] and it stayed in the forensic flab for
[645.52 - 648.08] 40
[646.00 - 649.52] years right at the police station or
[648.08 - 651.36] wherever it was going to be and they can
[649.52 - 651.76] take a q-tip and they can just find this
[651.36 - 654.48] one
[651.76 - 656.16] little speck take it and you get the a1c
[654.48 - 657.76] out of it you can get an anti-nuclear
[656.16 - 660.08] antigen test out of it you can get
[657.76 - 662.56] your nutritional profile out of right so
[660.08 - 665.12] what it is there's a massive blood scam
[662.56 - 666.48] i really believe it's done on purpose i
[665.12 - 668.88] do i believe
[666.48 - 670.72] the blood is not just being thrown away
[668.88 - 671.20] but i believe the blood hits the black
[670.72 - 674.00] market
[671.20 - 676.32] is what i do i believe it hits the black
[674.00 - 677.28] market for all kinds of sinister things
[676.32 - 680.40] at this point
[677.28 - 682.24] because why would they take that much
[680.40 - 684.64] millions and millions of gallons of
[682.24 - 686.96] blood you know what it is
[684.64 - 688.00] it's like it's it's it's a precious
[686.96 - 691.28] resource but
[688.00 - 694.16] they've trained us to think it's garbage
[691.28 - 694.88] they've trained you to believe that your
[694.16 - 698.08] blood
[694.88 - 701.36] is worth it's garbage
[698.08 - 701.60] it's it's a it's not precious it's not
[701.36 - 704.96] an
[701.60 - 707.68] important resource it's just trash

[707.68 - 710.40] out
[708.24 - 711.28] take too much of it and throw it all out
[710.40 - 713.28] okay
[711.28 - 714.48] and it's not easy for your blood your
[713.28 - 715.36] body to make but they're going to
[714.48 - 717.76] convince you

[730.64 - 734.64] immune cells in three days right
[733.12 - 736.32] people are already sick with symptoms
[734.64 - 739.28] their immune systems are already
[736.32 - 740.56] defunctled you know totally you know
[739.28 - 743.52] diffused and
[740.56 - 744.24] hurting and minimized and deficient
[743.52 - 746.08] right

[747.68 - 750.08] immune system will come back in two to
[749.28 - 753.12] three days
[750.08 - 754.64] all set perfect don't worry 14 vials 10
[753.12 - 756.96] vials seven vials
[754.64 - 758.00] dr fong i just saw you on there we're
[756.96 - 761.36] live on facebook
[758.00 - 764.80] in in youtube dr
[761.36 - 768.24] fun yeah the labs suck blood
[764.80 - 768.96] right parentheses blood and that's how
[768.24 - 771.52] it works
[768.96 - 772.08] it's really really bad you guys so let's
[771.52 - 774.32] cut let's
[772.08 - 775.68] let's go into this one truth bombs truth
[774.32 - 776.96] bombs are critical
[775.68 - 778.64] they're critical right it's about
[776.96 - 780.24] protecting the chronic leo it's about
[778.64 - 781.68] protecting people it's about protecting
[780.24 - 784.96] people's lives
[781.68 - 788.48] it's about making sure you don't get
[784.96 - 791.60] hurt because the system is set up
[788.48 - 793.60] for you to get hurt every day
[791.60 - 795.44] in it that's how the system set up is
[793.60 - 797.20] for you to get hurt that's how it is
[795.44 - 798.72] the alternative movement is set up for
[797.20 - 800.72] you to get hurt too and that's what
[798.72 - 803.36] we're talking about the pitfall
[800.72 - 804.08] lowers your immune system so the blood
[803.36 - 806.32] draw
[804.08 - 808.16] lowers your immune system that's one of
[806.32 - 810.64] the pitfalls right
[808.16 - 811.36] okay what's another pitfall hcl
[810.64 - 813.60] supplements
[811.36 - 814.64] thinking it's going to help your hcl
[813.60 - 818.64] meanwhile
[814.64 - 820.32] scorching your own stomach glands
[818.64 - 821.68] i've always talked about hcl supplements
[820.32 - 823.84] being really bad
[821.68 - 825.76] because they they aren't your natural
[823.84 - 827.92] gastric juices
[825.76 - 828.80] you know produced by your own stomach
[827.92 - 830.72] glands
[828.80 - 832.16] so when you take the hydrochloric acid
[830.72 - 834.56] supplements you
[832.16 - 835.76] burn your stomach you burn your gut you
[834.56 - 838.72] burn your duodenum
[835.76 - 840.96] that's not your hcl from a human being
[838.72 - 843.12] that from your actual glands themselves
[840.96 - 845.52] dr fun he's not saying don't do blood
[843.12 - 846.00] tests he says do less but you have to
[845.52 - 848.24] self
[846.00 - 849.68] advocate listen to the podcast medical
[848.24 - 853.84] meeting podcast at apple pod
[849.68 - 856.64] podcast blood draw uh uh blood draw
[853.84 - 859.04] which was the name of that podcast oh
[856.64 - 859.44] and vampirism right blood test blood
[859.04 - 862.64] drop
[859.44 - 863.92] vampirism right um and bloodletting
[862.64 - 864.64] that's the other thing so the bottom
[863.92 - 866.32] line is
[864.64 - 868.72] listen to that episode blood droplet
[866.32 - 870.40] letting vampirism get get to know it's
[868.72 - 871.68] an important one i'm not against blood
[870.40 - 873.36] draw i'm not against your
[871.68 - 876.56] blood test i'm not against you getting a
[873.36 - 878.48] blood test but this is critical to know
[876.56 - 880.44] critical to know cindy lou good to see
[878.48 - 883.92] you this is critical
[880.44 - 885.68] information to protect you yeah it's
[883.92 - 888.96] that important right
[885.68 - 890.64] it's vampirism it's vampirism you know
[888.96 - 892.32] this day and age let's talk about this i
[890.64 - 894.16] did the hcl for a couple of seconds
[892.32 - 894.72] letting you guys know the hcl that they
[894.16 - 897.12] give you
[894.72 - 898.80] and say hey take this hydrochloric acid
[897.12 - 900.64] supplement because alternative medicine
[898.80 - 901.92] is a bunch of pitfalls too a tremendous
[900.64 - 903.76] amount of pitfalls so
[901.92 - 905.76] the hcl supplements i've seen that
[903.76 - 907.92] damage people over the years
[905.76 - 909.60] i really have so you got to look out you
[907.92 - 912.00] don't want to be doing the hcl
[909.60 - 914.64] supplements because it's damaging
[912.00 - 916.64] and how is it damaging it scorches your
[914.64 - 917.36] own stomach glands it scorches your own
[916.64 - 920.00] stomach
[917.36 - 921.04] lining scorches your duodenum it's not
[920.00 - 923.44] the same thing
[921.04 - 924.08] as your own stomach glands producing
[923.44 - 927.28] gastric
[924.08 - 929.84] acid a specific blend i talk about
[927.28 - 931.84] in medical medium new edition right here
[929.84 - 935.04] where i talk about the seven
[931.84 - 936.72] blend gastric acid right so
[935.04 - 938.72] when they give you hydrochloric acid
[936.72 - 942.24] supplements that's not the seven
[938.72 - 945.28] blend of hcl narashini good to see you
[942.24 - 946.24] um we need to take we need to be vampire
[945.28 - 948.56] slayers
[946.24 - 949.68] uh yeah that's really funny lunell hey
[948.56 - 951.44] what's happening
[949.68 - 953.28] you called me live i'm glad i caught you
[951.44 - 954.80] live too i caught you live too it's good
[953.28 - 957.28] to be here
[954.80 - 958.00] um so it's important to know that that
[957.28 - 960.24] hcl
[958.00 - 962.48] is the bad stuff right the hydrochloric
[960.24 - 963.04] acid supplements that's a pitfall all on
[962.48 - 964.72] its own
[963.04 - 967.52] let's hit more pitfalls what's another
[964.72 - 970.64] one right there sodium bicarbonate
[967.52 - 974.96] that's a that's a pitfall all in its own
[970.64 - 979.12] it is an intestinal liner irritant
[974.96 - 980.16] it harms all of our good microorganisms
[979.12 - 981.84] and if we're all about good
[980.16 - 982.80] microorganisms if we're all about good
[981.84 - 986.08] bacteria
[982.80 - 987.56] good microorganic organisms that sodium
[986.08 - 991.12] bicarbonate
[987.56 - 994.84] annihilates good bacteria
[991.12 - 997.84] annihilates important good
[994.84 - 1000.40] microorganisms annihilates
[997.84 - 1001.92] these things a beneficial fungus we need
[1000.40 - 1003.76] to survive we have beneficial
[1001.92 - 1004.40] fungusiness that's how we stay alive
[1003.76 - 1007.12] right
[1004.40 - 1008.08] that's how we absorb right well sodium
[1007.12 - 1011.60] bicarbonate
[1008.08 - 1013.44] holds no bar just goes right in there
[1011.60 - 1016.56] holds no quarter
[1013.44 - 1017.12] goes in there and it starts to it starts
[1016.56 - 1021.04] to
[1017.12 - 1021.92] uh injure our good microorganisms not to
[1021.04 - 1024.24] mention
[1021.92 - 1025.52] total irritant on the lining of the
[1024.24 - 1027.44] intestinal tract
[1025.52 - 1029.36] small intestinal tract large intestinal
[1027.44 - 1031.44] tract that's something right there
[1029.36 - 1032.88] never liked one one bit if you guys just
[1031.44 - 1033.92] came on making the banana cherry
[1032.88 - 1035.20] smoothie i'm talking about all the
[1033.92 - 1036.16] pitfalls i'm talking about all the
[1035.20 - 1037.68] supplements
[1036.16 - 1039.36] all the different stuff that's out there
[1037.68 - 1041.28] the trends the trendy traps
[1039.36 - 1043.12] karen says so what can we replace sodium
[1041.28 - 1046.88] bicarbonate with
[1043.12 - 1048.96] uh you're just you just don't need it
[1046.88 - 1051.28] there's nothing that you have to replace
[1048.96 - 1053.12] sodium bicarbonate with because sodium
[1051.28 - 1054.56] bicarbonate isn't something that's
[1053.12 - 1057.36] giving you something
[1054.56 - 1058.00] internally so it's not providing
[1057.36 - 1061.52] anything
[1058.00 - 1063.12] for you right so you use it for baking
[1061.52 - 1064.72] you know that's what you could do i
[1063.12 - 1066.32] guess but it's not if that's what you
[1064.72 - 1067.68] wanted to do but i wouldn't recommend
[1066.32 - 1070.88] look i wouldn't recommend
[1067.68 - 1071.52] using it internally is is the whole
[1070.88 - 1074.56] point
[1071.52 - 1078.00] so this is about ingesting it
[1074.56 - 1079.36] right you know you can bake without it
[1078.00 - 1080.96] too you can bake without sodium
[1079.36 - 1083.60] bicarbonate but you don't need
[1080.96 - 1084.96] sodium bicarbonate so replacing sodium
[1083.60 - 1087.84] bicarbonate isn't so
[1084.96 - 1088.32] okay so all right it's almost like if
[1087.84 - 1091.60] you
[1088.32 - 1093.52] well it's almost like arsenic right you
[1091.60 - 1095.04] you're not supposed to be drinking
[1093.52 - 1096.96] arsenic
[1095.04 - 1100.56] so if someone says hey don't drink
[1096.96 - 1102.56] arsenic what can you replace it with
[1100.56 - 1104.32] i don't know what i mean it's not like
[1102.56 - 1106.64] somebody okay something like say
[1104.32 - 1108.08] you love whiskey it's like stop drinking
[1106.64 - 1109.92] whiskey because it's going to hurt
[1108.08 - 1112.16] your liver it's going to hurt you what
[1109.92 - 1115.04] do i replace whiskey with
[1112.16 - 1116.56] uh vodka no you don't want to replace
[1115.04 - 1117.84] you're not trying to replace it you're
[1116.56 - 1119.28] not trying to replace it but it's a good
[1117.84 - 1121.68] question
[1119.28 - 1122.80] so anyway let's move on to another one
[1121.68 - 1125.36] too
[1122.80 - 1127.28] i'm talking about sodium bicarbonate um
[1125.36 - 1129.76] put it this way i've seen people with
[1127.28 - 1131.28] crohn's colitis celiac digestive
[1129.76 - 1133.36] problems bloating
[1131.28 - 1136.08] dump a bunch of sodium bicarbonate in
[1133.36 - 1137.92] and literally be in fetal position
[1136.08 - 1139.52] and have to go to the emergency room
[1137.92 - 1141.36] they're at the er now
[1139.52 - 1142.96] and now they're going through the whole
[1141.36 - 1145.20] stages of the er
[1142.96 - 1147.36] they're waiting there waiting to see a
[1145.20 - 1148.72] doctor doctor doesn't understand their
[1147.36 - 1150.00] condition anyway
[1148.72 - 1151.60] they've already been diagnosed with
[1150.00 - 1152.40] crohn's and doctors like well crohn's
[1151.60 - 1154.88] will whatever
[1152.40 - 1156.72] we'll you know have you you know maybe
[1154.88 - 1158.32] we can give you a medication tonight and
[1156.72 - 1160.24] send you home with and
[1158.32 - 1162.00] this person's suffering and they got and
[1160.24 - 1163.76] they did the whole sodium bicarbonate
[1162.00 - 1165.20] i've seen this over and over again
[1163.76 - 1166.88] let's head to another one iron
[1165.20 - 1168.48] supplements gotta be careful with iron
[1166.88 - 1170.56] supplements because when people are low
[1168.48 - 1172.48] in iron you have to keep this in mind
[1170.56 - 1174.00] if the iron supplements aren't really
[1172.48 - 1177.20] natural like really
[1174.00 - 1178.00] clean like really like derived from a
[1177.20 - 1180.72] good source
[1178.00 - 1181.12] like with me with iron supplements with
[1180.72 - 1184.48] me
[1181.12 - 1186.24] is that i like to recommend foods that
[1184.48 - 1189.44] are always high in iron right
[1186.24 - 1192.56] with the leafy greens right um
[1189.44 - 1195.92] the i like some raisins you know i like
[1192.56 - 1197.36] wild blueberries i like things that have
[1195.92 - 1200.00] the iron in it
[1197.36 - 1201.84] which are important right the herbs it's
[1200.00 - 1204.40] another thing too the cilantro
[1201.84 - 1206.24] parsley i love i love the foods that
[1204.40 - 1208.72] have the iron in there right
[1206.24 - 1210.08] that's a whole thing too it's it's the
[1208.72 - 1212.40] reason why we go
[1210.08 - 1214.72] low in iron is because we're also
[1212.40 - 1216.72] low-grade viral infections so
[1214.72 - 1218.64] we got the viruses right so that's
[1216.72 - 1221.52] another thing all in its own
[1218.64 - 1222.32] you got the viruses and viruses like
[1221.52 - 1225.52] epstein-barr
[1222.32 - 1226.24] feed off of iron so that's why the iron
[1225.52 - 1228.96] drops
[1226.24 - 1230.96] because the viruses feed off of iron so
[1228.96 - 1232.88] we have to be cautious right
[1230.96 - 1235.20] so you keep if you're if you know if the
[1232.88 - 1236.88] doctor is giving you all these iron
[1235.20 - 1238.24] supplements and stuff care and churchill
[1236.88 - 1241.12] iron supplements help
[1238.24 - 1242.08] keep me anemic right helped keep me
[1241.12 - 1244.64] anemic
[1242.08 - 1246.48] so you got to be cautious with iron
[1244.64 - 1248.24] supplements because iron supplements
[1246.48 - 1250.00] cause a lot of trouble with a lot of
[1248.24 - 1252.00] people what it does is
[1250.00 - 1253.68] the symptoms can get worse when you're
[1252.00 - 1254.48] dumping in a lot of iron supplements
[1253.68 - 1256.40] because
[1254.48 - 1258.48] it's fuel for certain varieties of
[1256.40 - 1259.60] epstein-barr virus they love to feed off
[1258.48 - 1261.84] of iron so then
[1259.60 - 1263.28] you're dumping more iron in and then the
[1261.84 - 1264.88] virus are eating more and how you're
[1263.28 - 1266.24] getting more body aches and pains you're
[1264.88 - 1267.36] getting a little bit more fatigue and
[1266.24 - 1268.48] the doctor's just like well you're
[1267.36 - 1270.00] getting more fatigue because you're
[1268.48 - 1270.80] anemic meanwhile the doctor is supposed
[1270.00 - 1272.88] to be saying
[1270.80 - 1275.04] you're getting more fatigue because of
[1272.88 - 1277.44] low-grade viral infections
[1275.04 - 1278.80] and and and but they don't say that and
[1277.44 - 1279.76] that's the whole thing on it's all on
[1278.80 - 1281.76] its own
[1279.76 - 1284.16] dolly says i take a tiny bit of sodium
[1281.76 - 1285.44] bicarbonate occasionally it eases my
[1284.16 - 1289.28] acid burn
[1285.44 - 1292.08] i use apples too however i notice less
[1289.28 - 1292.88] reflux with iodine as prescribed by dr
[1292.08 - 1296.88] brownstein
[1292.88 - 1299.44] iodine protocol so what i like to do for
[1296.88 - 1301.92] reflux is i like to fix the problem
[1299.44 - 1303.20] so that's what i like to do because acid
[1301.92 - 1306.24] reflux is
[1303.20 - 1308.16] streptococcus bacteria staph bacteria
[1306.24 - 1309.36] it's e coli bacteria it's a lot of
[1308.16 - 1311.84] bacteria
[1309.36 - 1312.48] acid reflux is also a stagnant sluggish
[1311.84 - 1315.28] liver
[1312.48 - 1316.72] so what i like to do with acid reflux so
[1315.28 - 1318.56] that it's not just
[1316.72 - 1320.88] coming and going and you're trying to
[1318.56 - 1323.44] find some things to kind of soothe it
[1320.88 - 1325.76] i like to actually fix it so what i like
[1323.44 - 1327.36] to do is lower fats it's something
[1325.76 - 1329.12] that helps all on its own because you're
[1327.36 - 1331.52] not bombarding the liver you're not
[1329.12 - 1332.32] fatting yourself to death because that's
[1331.52 - 1334.96] what everybody does
[1332.32 - 1336.16] they fat themselves to death they fat
[1334.96 - 1338.72] themselves to
[1336.16 - 1340.72] death is what they do it's fat let me
[1338.72 - 1342.72] have more fat let me have more fat no i
[1340.72 - 1345.20] need more fat let me grab more
[1342.72 - 1345.76] no grab some more fat here yeah let me
[1345.20 - 1348.16] grab
[1345.76 - 1349.36] let me grab a chicken i'll grab some
[1348.16 - 1351.04] more fat here
[1349.36 - 1352.64] let me grab a chicken that's what i'm
[1351.04 - 1354.16] going to do here too i want to call a
[1352.64 - 1357.44] friend
[1354.16 - 1357.44] let me call a friend here
[1359.28 - 1363.76] you coming over for chicken yeah i made
[1362.48 - 1365.60] a chicken
[1363.76 - 1368.00] yeah roasted chicken i roasted it in the
[1365.60 - 1371.76] oven uh-huh
[1368.00 - 1374.64] you're i you can take the skin off
[1371.76 - 1376.24] and just have the white meat yeah the
[1374.64 - 1379.84] white meat
[1376.24 - 1382.80] that's fine yeah uh-huh
[1379.84 - 1383.76] yeah there's no fat in the white meat
[1382.80 - 1386.80] there is
[1383.76 - 1389.28] there is fat in the white meat oh
[1386.80 - 1391.04] okay i didn't know i thought it was just
[1389.28 - 1393.04] in the skin
[1391.04 - 1394.08] there's plenty of fat in the white meat
[1393.04 - 1397.12] okay
[1394.08 - 1399.20] the thing is is you gotta you got acid
[1397.12 - 1402.24] reflux
[1399.20 - 1404.48] so so the chicken fat might be really
[1402.24 - 1407.52] hard on what the gallbladder
[1404.48 - 1409.12] really i didn't know that the chicken
[1407.52 - 1410.40] fat's hard on the gallbladder
[1409.12 - 1412.16] think it'll help if i could turn this
[1410.40 - 1415.68] phone around yeah
[1412.16 - 1419.84] now i hear you better hey hey
[1415.68 - 1423.44] yeah okay what happens is that
[1419.84 - 1425.44] the gallbladder and the liver whoa
[1423.44 - 1427.60] it gets all you get worse when you're
[1425.44 - 1429.36] having all that fat
[1427.60 - 1430.72] all right well maybe maybe we'll have
[1429.36 - 1431.36] something else well maybe we'll have
[1430.72 - 1434.00] pizza
[1431.36 - 1436.16] is pizza okay tonight the same thing
[1434.00 - 1439.92] there's a lot of fat in the pizza
[1436.16 - 1444.56] uh all right maybe we'll have a
[1439.92 - 1446.48] turkey all right i'm gonna hang up
[1444.56 - 1448.24] so what happens is we fat ourselves to
[1446.48 - 1450.88] death you guys
[1448.24 - 1452.88] we blow out our gallbladders we blow out
[1450.88 - 1455.52] our pancreases we blow out our liver
[1452.88 - 1458.56] over time we blow out our stomach glands
[1455.52 - 1460.64] for the hcl we blow everything out and
[1458.56 - 1462.48] then we got the acid reflux
[1460.64 - 1464.56] and now you're looking for remedies well
[1462.48 - 1466.48] i'll try a little bit of this oh no that
[1464.56 - 1468.16] helps to soothe it too a little bit wait
[1466.48 - 1468.96] that helps to ease it off a little bit
[1468.16 - 1471.52] too
[1468.96 - 1472.00] i like fixing it i like fixing it fixing
[1471.52 - 1473.84] the liver
[1472.00 - 1475.12] lowering the fats bring in some celery
[1473.84 - 1477.68] juice right
[1475.12 - 1479.68] lower the fats again and try to get the
[1477.68 - 1481.36] liver out of that stagnant sluggish
[1479.68 - 1484.56] nature do 16 to 30
[1481.36 - 1486.16] 32 ounces of lemon water in the morning
[1484.56 - 1488.40] that's what i like to do i like to try
[1486.16 - 1491.20] to fix the liver so
[1488.40 - 1492.08] things strengthen hcl strengthens then i
[1491.20 - 1495.44] like to knock
[1492.08 - 1498.64] bacteria down if it was me and that was
[1495.44 - 1500.48] happening i'd be on some golden seal
[1498.64 - 1501.92] that's what i would do you you guys do
[1500.48 - 1503.28] what the doctor tells you to do you do
[1501.92 - 1504.64] whatever your doctor tells you i'm just
[1503.28 - 1507.04] saying if it was me
[1504.64 - 1508.80] i'd be doing some goldenseal if i had
[1507.04 - 1510.80] some acid reflux
[1508.80 - 1512.00] i'd be doing that for sure it'd be doing
[1510.80 - 1514.00] licorice root
[1512.00 - 1515.52] because it's not you're not trying to
[1514.00 - 1518.16] remedy
[1515.52 - 1519.84] you're trying to fix you're trying to
[1518.16 - 1521.52] actually fix right
[1519.84 - 1523.04] um and cleanse the heel i have some
[1521.52 - 1525.92] other options too with
[1523.04 - 1526.88] uh with with um with acid reflux a
[1525.92 - 1530.40] protocol
[1526.88 - 1533.76] all of it so it's important to do
[1530.40 - 1535.68] it's um g colgin says it's a lot of
[1533.76 - 1537.52] information to remember took me a long
[1535.68 - 1540.08] time to absorb
[1537.52 - 1542.00] yeah it's information to actually help
[1540.08 - 1544.48] you heal when you take the time to apply
[1542.00 - 1546.16] it then you can heal and go all the way
[1544.48 - 1548.48] i know everybody wants a magic pill
[1546.16 - 1549.84] don't want a magic pill yeah someone
[1548.48 - 1551.76] gave me a magic pill
[1549.84 - 1553.20] there's a magic pill in here so let me
[1551.76 - 1554.48] see what kind of what do i have i got a
[1553.20 - 1557.36] magic pill in here
[1554.48 - 1558.72] let me uh let me take a magic pill and
[1557.36 - 1560.40] that's what they want they want that
[1558.72 - 1563.68] magic pill like
[1560.40 - 1567.28] oh my god that's it
[1563.68 - 1570.88] that's it doctor that's the magic pill
[1567.28 - 1573.84] doctor that's the magic pill right there
[1570.88 - 1575.84] all i got to do is pop that pill
[1573.84 - 1579.20] everything's fixed
[1575.84 - 1581.20] everything goes away that's all i need
[1579.20 - 1583.28] and that's what everybody wants that's
[1581.20 - 1584.08] what everybody wants they don't want to
[1583.28 - 1586.08] know
[1584.08 - 1587.84] you know what's really going on but i
[1586.08 - 1589.92] mean if i had the acid reflux i'd be
[1587.84 - 1590.96] doing some goldenseal to knock out the
[1589.92 - 1593.28] bacteria
[1590.96 - 1594.88] i'd be doing some licorice root knock
[1593.28 - 1597.76] out any viral stuff
[1594.88 - 1598.24] also it soothes the linings right i'd be
[1597.76 - 1601.76] if i
[1598.24 - 1603.44] if i had acid reflux um i'd be doing
[1601.76 - 1604.32] those for sure these are just a couple
[1603.44 - 1606.40] of things i would do
[1604.32 - 1607.44] lemon balm if i had acid reflux it's
[1606.40 - 1610.96] another one too
[1607.44 - 1613.04] be doing some zinc if i add acid reflux
[1610.96 - 1615.52] that's what i would be doing right
[1613.04 - 1617.44] and i'd be doing celery juice 16 to 32
[1615.52 - 1619.04] ounces i'd probably be doing 32 ounces
[1617.44 - 1621.04] of celery juice okay if i had acid
[1619.04 - 1623.12] reflux that's what i would do
[1621.04 - 1624.32] um definitely 32 ounces i'd be doing a
[1623.12 - 1626.24] lemon water right
[1624.32 - 1627.76] anyway these are the vimergy stuff right
[1626.24 - 1629.12] you guys know the vimorji
[1627.76 - 1630.96] because that's another thing because i'm
[1629.12 - 1633.12] going to go into some other stuff about
[1630.96 - 1634.88] how we get trapped on those down those
[1633.12 - 1636.00] pitfalls too because if you don't have
[1634.88 - 1636.88] the right supplements and there's
[1636.00 - 1638.88] alcohol in them
[1636.88 - 1640.80] with a really low grade or they got
[1638.88 - 1642.56] fillers or they got preservatives
[1640.80 - 1644.16] well then we're trying to climb that
[1642.56 - 1645.68] cliff i told you about
[1644.16 - 1647.12] we're trying to go and there's natural
[1645.68 - 1647.68] flavors in there you're trying to climb
[1647.12 - 1649.28] that cliff
[1647.68 - 1650.72] climbing that cliff i'm getting i'm
[1649.28 - 1652.24] trying to get to the top and then
[1650.72 - 1654.88] someone smacks you in the head and they
[1652.24 - 1657.68] smack in the heads with natural flavors
[1654.88 - 1658.32] msg right all right we got we got a lot
[1657.68 - 1660.08] to cover
[1658.32 - 1661.76] let's keep it going you can find the
[1660.08 - 1663.52] right supplements at medicalmedium.com
[1661.76 - 1666.08] the directory i have there
[1663.52 - 1667.68] it's really helpful i'm not sponsored by
[1666.08 - 1668.96] those guys this is my the stuff that i
[1667.68 - 1672.40] love my favorite
[1668.96 - 1675.04] talk about diatomaceous earth
[1672.40 - 1675.44] when i hear people are on diatomaceous
[1675.04 - 1678.96] earth
[1675.44 - 1681.44] right i i just feel for them
[1678.96 - 1683.20] it it gives me like a chill down my
[1681.44 - 1685.92] spine
[1683.20 - 1686.88] i've heard so many stories but seeing it
[1685.92 - 1689.44] in person
[1686.88 - 1691.68] too sophie says i got rid of my acid
[1689.44 - 1695.12] reflux had problems for 15 years
[1691.68 - 1696.64] incredible that's amazing diatomaceous
[1695.12 - 1698.72] dr fahn have you seen anything with
[1696.64 - 1701.84] diatomaceous earth particles ever
[1698.72 - 1703.92] i just see dr fonz there too um
[1701.84 - 1706.24] i've witnessed it for years right i
[1703.92 - 1708.56] remember this one case
[1706.24 - 1711.28] where the person was just ripped the
[1708.56 - 1713.76] shreds from it and
[1711.28 - 1715.20] it's it's and then i know this other
[1713.76 - 1718.64] case where
[1715.20 - 1721.04] um this person actually blamed
[1718.64 - 1722.80] the end of their life because of it it's
[1721.04 - 1726.24] the most saddest story
[1722.80 - 1728.24] i've ever ever ever seen i think the
[1726.24 - 1732.24] bottom line is what i don't like about
[1728.24 - 1734.08] diatomaceous earth is it
[1732.24 - 1735.44] clings to the walls of the intestinal
[1734.08 - 1737.36] lining and colon
[1735.44 - 1739.44] and when you're inflamed it's the last
[1737.36 - 1740.72] thing you want it causes so much agony
[1739.44 - 1742.48] for a lot of people and if you don't
[1740.72 - 1743.04] feel any agony and you feel fine and you
[1742.48 - 1745.12] don't
[1743.04 - 1746.24] you're good with it and you're taking it
[1745.12 - 1748.48] it doesn't mean it's
[1746.24 - 1750.56] not creating what i've always known as
[1748.48 - 1751.36] this malabsorption where you can't
[1750.56 - 1754.32] absorb
[1751.36 - 1755.92] properly you can't absorb the same thing
[1754.32 - 1757.44] charcoal does the same thing
[1755.92 - 1759.20] in many ways right people take the
[1757.44 - 1761.36] charcoal we'll get to that too
[1759.20 - 1763.36] this diatomaceous earth it's always just
[1761.36 - 1765.44] it's always been a problem
[1763.36 - 1767.04] sherry says i just received your updated
[1765.44 - 1769.12] medical medium book i started your
[1767.04 - 1771.04] protocol already feeling better after a
[1769.12 - 1773.20] week i have stage four ebv
[1771.04 - 1774.96] i'm so excited to be on this healing
[1773.20 - 1778.84] journey honored you're here
[1774.96 - 1782.24] truly it's the best news best news ever
[1778.84 - 1784.16] incredible yeah vanessa says i believe
[1782.24 - 1786.08] the iron supplements i took during third
[1784.16 - 1787.20] trimester and i developed severe
[1786.08 - 1790.48] preeclampsia
[1787.20 - 1791.60] i swore it was connected vanessa i'm
[1790.48 - 1792.64] going to tell you right now something
[1791.60 - 1795.12] that's really interesting
[1792.64 - 1796.00] okay is that preeclampsia is low grade
[1795.12 - 1798.08] viral
[1796.00 - 1799.04] so yeah so if you're taking an iron
[1798.08 - 1802.48] supplement
[1799.04 - 1805.60] during pregnancy and you're
[1802.48 - 1807.44] and there's a virus at hand the virus is
[1805.60 - 1808.24] going to get really strong because when
[1807.44 - 1809.92] you're pregnant
[1808.24 - 1811.76] 50 of your immune system when you're
[1809.92 - 1813.60] pregnant is watching the baby
[1811.76 - 1814.88] so that's important to know so here's
[1813.60 - 1818.72] how it works it's like
[1814.88 - 1820.32] 50 of your um 50 of your immune system
[1818.72 - 1822.80] is to take care of the baby
[1820.32 - 1824.16] that's what 50 does when you're pregnant
[1822.80 - 1825.28] is to take care of the baby your baby
[1824.16 - 1826.88] doesn't have an immune system when
[1825.28 - 1830.08] you're pregnant
[1826.88 - 1833.28] so your 50 goes to the baby
[1830.08 - 1834.56] right so now you only have 50
[1833.28 - 1836.64] of your immune system for the rest of
[1834.56 - 1839.28] your body instead of a hundred percent
[1836.64 - 1841.20] so you only have 50 now right now if you
[1839.28 - 1843.20] have any kind of low-grade viral issue
[1841.20 - 1845.52] you can get pre-eclampsia pretty easily
[1843.20 - 1847.52] for a lot of women so we dump a whole
[1845.52 - 1849.60] bunch of iron in there then we feed that
[1847.52 - 1851.28] virus right
[1849.60 - 1853.84] dump a whole bunch of iron in there and
[1851.28 - 1857.68] you feed the virus where's my virus
[1853.84 - 1858.96] here we are and the virus will start
[1857.68 - 1860.08] eating all the iron
[1858.96 - 1862.08] and next thing you know what you got
[1860.08 - 1863.04] this pre-eclampsia because the virus
[1862.08 - 1865.28] multiplies
[1863.04 - 1866.56] fast it proliferates when it's feeding
[1865.28 - 1870.08] off of the iron
[1866.56 - 1871.12] that's how it's done irma forgive me for
[1870.08 - 1873.60] my comment
[1871.12 - 1875.36] but i thought you were a little wacky
[1873.60 - 1878.08] but i was willing to read your

[2086.24 - 2089.36] daily basis is not the hair sprays it's
[2088.08 - 2092.00] not the conventional cleaners that's
[2089.36 - 2092.00] happenstance
[2093.92 - 2097.20] you know happenstance you know it's not
[2096.48 - 2100.56] the fact that
[2097.20 - 2104.40] 50 of all pharmaceuticals
[2100.56 - 2107.12] 50 of all pharmaceuticals are recalled
[2104.40 - 2108.16] from dangerous side effects fifty
[2107.12 - 2109.76] percent
[2108.16 - 2112.16] of all the pharmaceuticals in the world
[2109.76 - 2115.68] that have ever been minted and printed
[2112.16 - 2118.72] and produced and created fifty 50
[2115.68 - 2120.48] of all of them have been pulled
[2118.72 - 2121.76] because of side effects right no it's
[2120.48 - 2123.36] happenstance
[2121.76 - 2125.12] everything's everything's happenstance
[2123.36 - 2127.60] let's move on
[2125.12 - 2128.56] um whey protein powder it's one of my
[2127.60 - 2132.48] favorites it's a
[2128.56 - 2133.84] viral feeder viruses feed off of it you
[2132.48 - 2135.84] want to get sicker
[2133.84 - 2138.16] do some whey protein powder you want to
[2135.84 - 2141.44] get worse do some whey protein powder
[2138.16 - 2142.72] right i always say no way to weigh
[2141.44 - 2145.12] that's what i that's what i've always
[2142.72 - 2147.36] said all these years is like say no way
[2145.12 - 2149.28] to weigh and that's it whey protein
[2147.36 - 2150.56] powder plus they'll throw they'll throw
[2149.28 - 2152.40] all kinds of stuff in whey protein
[2150.56 - 2153.60] powder and boot it up and make it worse
[2152.40 - 2156.48] natural flavors
[2153.60 - 2157.76] which is msg whey protein powders always
[2156.48 - 2158.00] have natural flavors in there if you
[2157.76 - 2159.04] find
[2158.00 - 2162.16] one that doesn't have a natural
[2159.04 - 2164.80] flavoring it's still bad news
[2162.16 - 2166.32] yeah david happenstance that's what it
[2164.80 - 2167.76] is it's all happenstance
[2166.32 - 2170.56] so let's move on to another one whey
[2167.76 - 2173.68] protein powder is really really
[2170.56 - 2176.48] ear an irritant for people makes mucus
[2173.68 - 2177.60] form from feeding bacteria so whey
[2176.48 - 2179.92] protein powder
[2177.60 - 2181.52] feeds bacteria really easily that's
[2179.92 - 2183.52] another thing too you want to grow all
[2181.52 - 2185.20] that bad bacteria to keep on doing the
[2183.52 - 2187.92] whey protein powder right
[2185.20 - 2188.72] so we got that covered we got a lot of
[2187.92 - 2191.60] different things
[2188.72 - 2192.08] let's go into multivitamins junk junk
[2191.60 - 2195.36] junk
[2192.08 - 2198.08] junk junk multivitamins
[2195.36 - 2200.72] are the junk keep that in mind that's
[2198.08 - 2204.56] the multivitamins cheap
[2200.72 - 2205.44] low-grade vitamins sitting in vitamin
[2204.56 - 2209.48] storage
[2205.44 - 2212.88] bins massive lots of vitamin
[2209.48 - 2216.32] warehouses filled with vitamin
[2212.88 - 2219.76] powders the bad ones garbage
[2216.32 - 2221.12] bulk low grade sitting there sometimes
[2219.76 - 2224.32] for 10 years
[2221.12 - 2227.12] and you know what they don't put in the
[2224.32 - 2229.28] the expiration date doesn't start when
[2227.12 - 2231.36] they get the bulk stuff
[2229.28 - 2233.68] the bulk stuff that sits in these
[2231.36 - 2237.68] massive massive warehouses where
[2233.68 - 2240.56] the bad cheap vitamins get their stuff
[2237.68 - 2241.12] the expiration date starts when it gets
[2240.56 - 2244.08] into your
[2241.12 - 2244.48] bottle that's when it starts it doesn't
[2244.08 - 2248.32] start
[2244.48 - 2251.12] it could sit for 10 years
[2248.32 - 2251.52] and then you get this moldy vitamin that
[2251.12 - 2252.80] has
[2251.52 - 2254.16] a little bit of everything a little bit
[2252.80 - 2255.52] of calcium a little bit of this a little
[2254.16 - 2256.48] bit of that a little bit of selenium a
[2255.52 - 2258.08] little bit blah blah blah
[2256.48 - 2259.28] a little bit of some enzymes bubble all
[2258.08 - 2260.96] this other stuff all the way down a
[2259.28 - 2264.16] little vitamin a blah blah blah blah
[2260.96 - 2267.68] right your multivitamin the bees
[2264.16 - 2269.68] and all that that stuff is so old
[2267.68 - 2272.08] even though the date looks great hey
[2269.68 - 2274.96] this expires 2022.
[2272.08 - 2276.56] this one's fresh dude it's 10 years old
[2274.96 - 2280.20] already
[2276.56 - 2282.80] so low grade bulk garbage
[2280.20 - 2284.00] multivitamins where they rip you off a
[2282.80 - 2285.92] little speck of everything
[2284.00 - 2287.60] in there it's not even done right that's
[2285.92 - 2289.04] just one reason why it's not good
[2287.60 - 2290.80] multivitamins will have
[2289.04 - 2292.24] a lot of fillers in there a lot of
[2290.80 - 2293.84] garbage in there but the big
[2292.24 - 2296.72] reason why i also don't like the
[2293.84 - 2299.84] multivitamins is because
[2296.72 - 2301.12] it's it's the one the big reasons is
[2299.84 - 2304.48] this stuff
[2301.12 - 2306.40] is like ancient it's not produced and
[2304.48 - 2308.56] then goes out the door
[2306.40 - 2309.76] right manufacturing doesn't work like
[2308.56 - 2313.04] that for the low
[2309.76 - 2314.56] grade multi vitamin stuff for
[2313.04 - 2316.08] for all that stuff so that's one thing
[2314.56 - 2316.96] right there it's really important to go
[2316.08 - 2318.40] to another one
[2316.96 - 2320.40] that i mean that's just that's just one
[2318.40 - 2323.92] thing but i got to move along hair
[2320.40 - 2327.28] skin and nail supplements
[2323.92 - 2331.12] so hair skin nail supplements right
[2327.28 - 2334.00] that's a sham scam on its own
[2331.12 - 2334.56] okay because what's in there really
[2334.00 - 2337.60] isn't
[2334.56 - 2340.08] for your hair skin and nails
[2337.60 - 2341.04] right so you'll be told that you'll
[2340.08 - 2343.60] think that that's
[2341.04 - 2345.20] just bait it's like whoa my nails are
[2343.60 - 2347.28] getting chewed up really bad
[2345.20 - 2348.72] i need to do something about it let me i
[2347.28 - 2351.28] gotta strengthen them
[2348.72 - 2352.32] i can't grow my nails they're breaking
[2351.28 - 2354.80] all the time
[2352.32 - 2355.84] it's like one of those one of those
[2354.80 - 2357.92] vanity
[2355.84 - 2359.84] uh supplements right it's one of those
[2357.92 - 2361.60] vanity supplements i want my skin better
[2359.84 - 2362.88] i want my skin to look really good i
[2361.60 - 2364.32] want my skin good
[2362.88 - 2366.88] let me get that hair skin nail
[2364.32 - 2368.16] supplement another scam of a lifetime
[2366.88 - 2370.48] going on out there
[2368.16 - 2372.08] um same thing though right it's it's
[2370.48 - 2373.20] they put a little bit of all these
[2372.08 - 2375.52] things in there
[2373.20 - 2377.92] that could never move the needle and you
[2375.52 - 2380.00] buy it and you spend good money on it
[2377.92 - 2381.44] and then there's fillers in there too
[2380.00 - 2382.00] that's a whole nother thing all on its
[2381.44 - 2383.76] own so
[2382.00 - 2385.20] that that i mean just giving you a quick
[2383.76 - 2385.84] rundown of why i don't even like that
[2385.20 - 2387.76] stuff
[2385.84 - 2389.36] um and it's not even for hair skin and
[2387.76 - 2391.84] nails you want you want
[2389.36 - 2393.04] your skin better you got to do some
[2391.84 - 2396.00] stuff for it
[2393.04 - 2397.44] you know you've got to do something for
[2396.00 - 2398.08] it if you're getting hair loss as a
[2397.44 - 2400.32] woman
[2398.08 - 2402.08] that's adrenals that have to be
[2400.32 - 2404.16] addressed hair skin nail supplements
[2402.08 - 2405.92] don't address the adrenals
[2404.16 - 2407.76] so it's not even addressing why a
[2405.92 - 2409.84] woman's losing her hair like
[2407.76 - 2411.60] hair skin hair skin nail supplements
[2409.84 - 2413.44] aren't addressing adrenals
[2411.60 - 2415.36] they're not since that's important all
[2413.44 - 2417.04] on its own um
[2415.36 - 2418.80] and then let's keep on going a little
[2417.04 - 2421.84] bit more with this right
[2418.80 - 2424.96] so when it comes down to
[2421.84 - 2427.76] hair skin nail supplements okay keep in
[2424.96 - 2431.28] mind that this is how it works right
[2427.76 - 2434.56] what's in there is a man-made
[2431.28 - 2437.52] concoction of what
[2434.56 - 2438.00] someone thinks you will need to get your
[2437.52 - 2441.28] skin
[2438.00 - 2444.16] better your nails better right
[2441.28 - 2444.88] and that's a mistake all on its own in
[2444.16 - 2447.12] order to get
[2444.88 - 2449.44] nails better you have to fix the liver
[2447.12 - 2452.00] but a hair skin nail supplement
[2449.44 - 2453.68] isn't going to fix your liver it's not
[2452.00 - 2456.88] there to repair your
[2453.68 - 2458.88] liver keep that in mind right so
[2456.88 - 2460.56] already we're off the mark like boom
[2458.88 - 2462.56] down the drain we're already going down
[2460.56 - 2465.28] the drain we already have a problem
[2462.56 - 2466.00] in order for hair skin nail supplement
[2465.28 - 2468.64] to be a hair
[2466.00 - 2470.00] skin nail supplement it has has to be
[2468.64 - 2472.16] fixing your liver
[2470.00 - 2474.80] and it's not fixing your liver in order
[2472.16 - 2477.44] to get your nails to way you want them
[2474.80 - 2478.32] you've got to fix your liver that's your
[2477.44 - 2481.52] vitamin
[2478.32 - 2484.96] mineral producer in a way
[2481.52 - 2486.96] or storage bin right that's what's
[2484.96 - 2488.40] storing all your vitamins and then
[2486.96 - 2490.56] converting them
[2488.40 - 2491.92] if your liver stagnant and sluggish and
[2490.56 - 2493.68] having problems
[2491.92 - 2496.32] you're not going to be fixing that liver
[2493.68 - 2499.20] with a jamokey
[2496.32 - 2501.36] gimmicky hair skin hair skin nail
[2499.20 - 2503.68] supplement it's not going to happen
[2501.36 - 2506.56] um it has to be something that's geared
[2503.68 - 2508.56] towards fixing a stagnant sluggish liver
[2506.56 - 2510.48] that's what it needs like that's what
[2508.56 - 2512.24] you need and that's a problem all on its
[2510.48 - 2513.52] own so that's a big one looking for my
[2512.24 - 2517.84] liver right now
[2513.52 - 2520.96] um and so keep that in mind really
[2517.84 - 2520.96] so that's something there
[2521.20 - 2525.36] so the bottom line is that's when it
[2523.84 - 2527.20] comes down to nails so when it comes
[2525.36 - 2530.48] down to fixing your liver
[2527.20 - 2532.08] it comes down to fixing
[2530.48 - 2533.60] it comes down to fixing your nails it
[2532.08 - 2535.76] comes down to fixing your liver
[2533.60 - 2537.52] comes down to fixing your skin you have
[2535.76 - 2539.92] to fix your liver
[2537.52 - 2542.24] so okay let me go take let me go grab
[2539.92 - 2543.28] let me go grab this hair skin and nail
[2542.24 - 2547.04] supplement
[2543.28 - 2549.12] right okay um i need my skin better
[2547.04 - 2550.40] so i'm gonna grab this skin supplement
[2549.12 - 2553.68] over here
[2550.40 - 2555.76] uh but if the skin supplement doesn't
[2553.68 - 2559.52] have anything in there to fix your liver
[2555.76 - 2562.00] or to help your liver in any way then
[2559.52 - 2562.96] it's not helping you okay same thing
[2562.00 - 2565.20] with collagen
[2562.96 - 2566.80] you can't take collagen so that's the
[2565.20 - 2568.48] next one we'll talk about you can't take
[2566.80 - 2570.32] collagen
[2568.48 - 2572.08] maybe i'll put the liver in the cherry
[2570.32 - 2573.60] smoothie right we'll chop up some liver
[2572.08 - 2574.64] or put some liver in the cherry smoothie
[2573.60 - 2578.64] just kidding around
[2574.64 - 2581.28] you can't take a collagen to

[2689.28 - 2695.20] is incredible it really is
[2692.08 - 2696.80] um so we're going into the cup you go
[2695.20 - 2700.56] going into the collagen a little bit
[2696.80 - 2703.52] more basically what happens is that
[2700.56 - 2705.12] we we think that if we can take
[2703.52 - 2707.36] something
[2705.12 - 2709.04] right that has that word well my
[2707.36 - 2711.92] collagen is bad
[2709.04 - 2714.00] uh my skin's getting all fallen apart
[2711.92 - 2715.92] it's getting i'm aging fast my skin's
[2714.00 - 2717.52] getting saggy i got problems
[2715.92 - 2719.12] better get that collagen in me because
[2717.52 - 2721.52] isn't it my collagen
[2719.12 - 2723.60] and then we and then all the trendy
[2721.52 - 2725.44] giants out there right they sell all
[2723.60 - 2727.12] that collagen and the man they're
[2725.44 - 2728.80] manufacturing and they're making
[2727.12 - 2730.48] millions and millions of dollars and
[2728.80 - 2733.76] everybody's sucked into it and the
[2730.48 - 2736.24] ads go out that's how it works
[2733.76 - 2737.36] you guys need to know it's you guys are
[2736.24 - 2739.84] just you're
[2737.36 - 2740.96] you're part of the ad campaign that's
[2739.84 - 2744.56] out there
[2740.96 - 2747.28] right it's throw ads at you guys 24
[2744.56 - 2749.20] 7 throw ads at you guys for collagen
[2747.28 - 2750.80] throw ads at you guys for all this other
[2749.20 - 2753.28] stuff hair skin dance throw
[2750.80 - 2754.88] throw ads at you and that's how they do
[2753.28 - 2756.56] it right and then it catches on and
[2754.88 - 2758.40] people are taking it and it catches on
[2756.56 - 2760.56] because the ads are just going in and
[2758.40 - 2762.24] in and in and a million dollars in ads a
[2760.56 - 2765.68] month these companies spend
[2762.24 - 2767.92] a million dollars in ads a month
[2765.68 - 2768.72] to make sure you guys keep on buying
[2767.92 - 2770.96] that stuff
[2768.72 - 2773.52] right so you know all this information
[2770.96 - 2774.96] is really it's precious information
[2773.52 - 2777.28] i had a doctor tell me that the other
[2774.96 - 2778.16] day beth says what about fish oil let's
[2777.28 - 2781.52] go
[2778.16 - 2783.60] this oil said there right
[2781.52 - 2785.68] fish oil is a bad one i actually have a
[2783.60 - 2789.84] fish oil bottle somewhere around here
[2785.68 - 2792.64] but before this for this as a prop
[2789.84 - 2792.96] fish oil is one of those things where we
[2792.64 - 2794.72] get
[2792.96 - 2796.96] sold a bill of goods with that one like
[2794.72 - 2797.52] we need that omega in the fish oil like
[2796.96 - 2799.96] we need
[2797.52 - 2802.08] fish oil right we're sold we're
[2799.96 - 2804.96] brainwashed into fish oil
[2802.08 - 2805.68] okay and the irony is is we don't need
[2804.96 - 2807.92] fish oil
[2805.68 - 2809.12] so what they do is they take all these
[2807.92 - 2811.76] body parts
[2809.12 - 2812.80] fish body parts that aren't being used
[2811.76 - 2815.60] okay so they take
[2812.80 - 2816.72] fish and they flay the fish they take
[2815.60 - 2818.40] the fillet
[2816.72 - 2820.16] and they put that in the restaurants
[2818.40 - 2821.44] right they take the filet they put that
[2820.16 - 2823.12] in the grocery stores
[2821.44 - 2825.04] they take to the filet they put that in
[2823.12 - 2826.88] the seafood market right
[2825.04 - 2830.08] they take that filet and they make it
[2826.88 - 2831.68] into fish sticks frozen fish right
[2830.08 - 2833.68] and then they take the heads the tails
[2831.68 - 2836.08] the fins some of the guts
[2833.68 - 2837.84] they take all that and the skin and
[2836.08 - 2838.72] everything else and all this gnarly
[2837.84 - 2840.40] stuff
[2838.72 - 2842.64] and they take that and they send that to
[2840.40 - 2846.32] the fish oil companies right
[2842.64 - 2848.96] fish oil companies got a billion fish
[2846.32 - 2849.92] different kinds of fish all mixed up
[2848.96 - 2853.52] different fish
[2849.92 - 2856.64] parts all messed up mitch mashed right
[2853.52 - 2858.64] and then they press it press it press it
[2856.64 - 2860.32] to get all that fish oil out of it
[2858.64 - 2862.00] okay which is actually the whole thing's
[2860.32 - 2864.64] just sick right
[2862.00 - 2866.32] then that fish oil has got more mercury
[2864.64 - 2867.68] in it than if you were to eat a piece of
[2866.32 - 2869.76] fish
[2867.68 - 2871.84] so that fish oil's got more mercury in
[2869.76 - 2873.04] it than if you were gonna ever eat a
[2871.84 - 2874.96] piece of fish
[2873.04 - 2876.08] that's what's really interesting about
[2874.96 - 2879.12] it okay so
[2876.08 - 2880.96] it's got more mercury and if you were
[2879.12 - 2885.68] ever to eat the salmon right here
[2880.96 - 2889.44] okay so that salmon's got mercury in it
[2885.68 - 2889.84] but that salmon has way less mercury in
[2889.44 - 2891.36] it
[2889.84 - 2893.68] than if you were going to have a fish
[2891.36 - 2896.88] oil supplement now fish oil company be
[2893.68 - 2899.68] like no no no we remove our mercury
[2896.88 - 2900.56] nope we get ours tested we remove the
[2899.68 - 2902.88] mercury
[2900.56 - 2904.56] when they do that mercury removal right
[2902.88 - 2906.72] that centrifuge
[2904.56 - 2909.04] and they do that mercury removal they're
[2906.72 - 2912.88] creating a homeopathic
[2909.04 - 2917.04] nightmare a homeopathic nightmare
[2912.88 - 2919.28] when you remove mercury out of fish oil
[2917.04 - 2920.96] you leave the essence of that mercury
[2919.28 - 2923.04] behind
[2920.96 - 2924.48] now we made it hundreds of times
[2923.04 - 2927.44] stronger we turned it into a
[2924.48 - 2929.60] methyl mercury a mercury that can travel
[2927.44 - 2932.40] deeper into the brain
[2929.60 - 2934.24] so fish oil supplements take you to also
[2932.40 - 2937.92] you want alzheimer's
[2934.24 - 2939.12] do you guys want dementia you want to
[2937.92 - 2941.12] you don't want to know where your car
[2939.12 - 2942.48] keys are ever ever
[2941.12 - 2943.68] you don't want to know where your phone
[2942.48 - 2944.56] you don't want to remember your phone
[2943.68 - 2945.76] number
[2944.56 - 2948.00] you don't want to remember your best
[2945.76 - 2950.88] friend's phone number um
[2948.00 - 2952.00] you want severe debilitating anxiety
[2950.88 - 2954.56] depression
[2952.00 - 2956.24] uh keep on doing fish oil because it'll
[2954.56 - 2958.48] take you there faster
[2956.24 - 2960.00] that's the brain killer it's one of the
[2958.48 - 2962.96] brain killers
[2960.00 - 2964.40] and um so the fish oil thing is the real
[2962.96 - 2965.92] scary thing for me
[2964.40 - 2967.68] for a lot of people and i'm worried
[2965.92 - 2969.52] about a lot of people that are on it
[2967.68 - 2971.28] because it's like dude it's time to
[2969.52 - 2972.56] reverse whatever damage that has
[2971.28 - 2974.32] occurred all these years you've been on
[2972.56 - 2975.68] fish oil all these years it's time to do
[2974.32 - 2979.04] something about it right
[2975.68 - 2979.04] so i'm going to put the salmon away
[2979.68 - 2983.36] we're live right now if you guys didn't
[2981.12 - 2985.60] know
[2983.36 - 2986.64] uh cassandra risley my ferritin is
[2985.60 - 2988.56] extremely low
[2986.64 - 2990.32] how do i how do i get it to increase
[2988.56 - 2991.60] without an iron supplement if they're
[2990.32 - 2993.28] bad for you
[2991.60 - 2995.20] if you have to go with an iron
[2993.28 - 2995.84] supplement go with a plant-based iron
[2995.20 - 2997.36] supplement
[2995.84 - 2999.04] i mean that's what i would do do what
[2997.36 - 3000.24] your doctor tells you because android
[2999.04 - 3002.00] your doctor tells you your doctor tells
[3000.24 - 3002.56] you to do this or that or take iron or
[3002.00 - 3004.00] whatever it is
[3002.56 - 3005.92] you listen to your doctor but i'm just
[3004.00 - 3008.40] saying that if it was me
[3005.92 - 3010.32] and i had low iron what i would do is i
[3008.40 - 3013.12] would get it from foods
[3010.32 - 3014.00] if you or if if my doctor was telling me
[3013.12 - 3015.60] hey
[3014.00 - 3017.04] you should do you know iron here's the
[3015.60 - 3018.56] iron and be like well let me go find a
[3017.04 - 3020.48] good plant-based iron and then ask your
[3018.56 - 3021.84] doctor's permission right
[3020.48 - 3023.84] um that's something right there but
[3021.84 - 3025.76] foods is like where i like to get iron
[3023.84 - 3027.04] from my wild blueberries i like to get
[3025.76 - 3030.08] iron from
[3027.04 - 3031.92] um from barley grass juice powder it's
[3030.08 - 3032.56] another thing too so i love to get iron
[3031.92 - 3035.12] from that
[3032.56 - 3038.08] love to get iron from spirulina because
[3035.12 - 3039.92] even small amounts of iron right this is
[3038.08 - 3041.04] barley grassy's powder right here even
[3039.92 - 3044.56] small amounts of
[3041.04 - 3047.84] iron okay um
[3044.56 - 3050.24] small amounts of iron right can be more
[3047.84 - 3051.92] assimilatable could be more absorbable
[3050.24 - 3054.56] could be more
[3051.92 - 3056.64] you can have more conversion process
[3054.56 - 3059.84] with that with your body and your liver
[3056.64 - 3062.48] because you can take gobs of iron
[3059.84 - 3063.44] and your body just not do anything with
[3062.48 - 3065.92] it right
[3063.44 - 3067.52] so then when the doctor draws your blood
[3065.92 - 3070.16] like well yeah your iron's up
[3067.52 - 3070.80] doesn't mean it's working but your irons
[3070.16 - 3072.16] up right
[3070.80 - 3074.56] so they draw the blood that's what
[3072.16 - 3075.20] happens there um i like knowing i'm
[3074.56 - 3079.20] getting
[3075.20 - 3080.48] choice iron from places like this is
[3079.20 - 3082.24] cherries because i make the banana
[3080.48 - 3083.28] cherry smoothie right there there's iron
[3082.24 - 3085.76] and cherries
[3083.28 - 3087.12] iron wild blueberries iron and grapes
[3085.76 - 3089.36] and raisins
[3087.12 - 3090.32] it's ironing you know barley grass juice
[3089.36 - 3091.92] powder right
[3090.32 - 3094.40] so that's that's what i'm talking about
[3091.92 - 3097.76] it's about it's about where to get it
[3094.40 - 3099.28] quality control okay and then
[3097.76 - 3101.20] i like to go after the bugs that are
[3099.28 - 3102.08] eating the iron i like to go after the
[3101.20 - 3103.36] viruses
[3102.08 - 3104.72] that are eating the eye that's what i
[3103.36 - 3105.36] would do you do what your doctor tells
[3104.72 - 3107.04] you but
[3105.36 - 3108.48] i'm just saying that what i would do is
[3107.04 - 3110.64] i'd be going after
[3108.48 - 3112.32] i'd be going after the bugs that are
[3110.64 - 3113.44] going after the iron that i talk about
[3112.32 - 3116.56] all the time
[3113.44 - 3118.56] regina my ferritin has never been
[3116.56 - 3120.56] never been so high since almost three
[3118.56 - 3120.88] years of medical medium i'm so grateful
[3120.56 - 3122.64] for
[3120.88 - 3123.92] uh for you so because you're going after
[3122.64 - 3124.64] the viruses you're actually doing it
[3123.92 - 3125.92] right
[3124.64 - 3128.00] so you're going you're cleaning things
[3125.92 - 3130.96] up corella
[3128.00 - 3132.40] we're heading to carella now let's go
[3130.96 - 3135.12] there
[3132.40 - 3136.88] with corella cruella is one of these one
[3135.12 - 3139.12] of these
[3136.88 - 3140.40] supplements that are out there that i
[3139.12 - 3143.60] really don't like
[3140.40 - 3145.92] because it's irresponsible it doesn't
[3143.60 - 3146.72] remove toxic heavy metals it's caught
[3145.92 - 3149.68] this
[3146.72 - 3150.08] this talk amongst the health community
[3149.68 - 3152.24] that
[3150.08 - 3154.24] oh use it for removing heavy metals
[3152.24 - 3156.72] that's great because it doesn't work
[3154.24 - 3158.00] um it just doesn't it's one thing i
[3156.72 - 3159.20] don't like about another thing i don't
[3158.00 - 3162.24] like about corella
[3159.20 - 3164.00] is that it i've seen batches of it out
[3162.24 - 3167.76] there
[3164.00 - 3171.28] have bacteria in it that literally
[3167.76 - 3174.72] puts people in a state that's not good
[3171.28 - 3177.52] vomiting diarrhea vomiting vomiting
[3174.72 - 3178.40] fetal position and agony and cramps
[3177.52 - 3181.52] vomiting

[3185.20 - 3188.80] i've seen bad batches of krell for some
[3187.28 - 3191.52] reason that has slipped
[3188.80 - 3193.28] through the gates over the years you
[3191.52 - 3194.48] know the whole thing with krill i'm not
[3193.28 - 3196.00] a fan of it
[3194.48 - 3197.92] ten different reasons i'm just giving
[3196.00 - 3200.64] you two right there it doesn't remove
[3197.92 - 3202.56] metals out and if it does it drops them
[3200.64 - 3204.08] um talk about caffeine a little bit
[3202.56 - 3205.44] caffeine you guys know how much i've
[3204.08 - 3207.12] been talking about caffeine medical
[3205.44 - 3208.64] being podcasted apple podcasts i talk
[3207.12 - 3210.48] about caffeine right
[3208.64 - 3212.72] caffeine's a whole nother level right
[3210.48 - 3214.72] there of of problems you got the coffee
[3212.72 - 3216.64] drinks you got the energy drinks
[3214.72 - 3218.24] you got the coffee you got the chocolate
[3216.64 - 3218.88] right so you got the matcha tea you got
[3218.24 - 3221.36] the teas
[3218.88 - 3222.56] right you got the green teas caffeine
[3221.36 - 3225.60] that's the ager
[3222.56 - 3227.60] of our time right if women want to age
[3225.60 - 3229.12] and they want those wrinkles fast and
[3227.60 - 3230.00] they want those wrinkles in their early
[3229.12 - 3232.88] 30s and late
[3230.00 - 3235.04] 20s they want they want their skin to
[3232.88 - 3238.24] sag they want the malaysia they want the
[3235.04 - 3240.00] spots if if women want all that stuff
[3238.24 - 3241.68] then drink lots of caffeine
[3240.00 - 3243.84] drink your coffee drinks drink your your
[3241.68 - 3245.92] green tea drink your matcha tea
[3243.84 - 3248.00] just give you the rundown it's the ager
[3245.92 - 3251.12] it's the women ager
[3248.00 - 3253.12] and man ager two but it's the ager
[3251.12 - 3254.64] especially women because women have
[3253.12 - 3256.32] their adrenals are under different
[3254.64 - 3256.80] demands their adrenals go through
[3256.32 - 3258.96] different
[3256.80 - 3260.56] different things than men's adrenals do
[3258.96 - 3261.60] women's adrenals are always in more
[3260.56 - 3263.20] fight or flight
[3261.60 - 3265.12] and then when you add the caffeine you
[3263.20 - 3266.64] put them in super fight or flight
[3265.12 - 3268.40] then you burn out the hormones in the
[3266.64 - 3269.28] adrenals hormone producers that's
[3268.40 - 3272.24] another thing too
[3269.28 - 3273.28] but the caffeine burns out the liver it
[3272.24 - 3275.52] eats up
[3273.28 - 3277.52] it eats up the bones women get
[3275.52 - 3278.16] osteopenia from it they get teeth
[3277.52 - 3281.28] problems
[3278.16 - 3281.68] caffeine will be that's the literally
[3281.28 - 3285.20] the
[3281.68 - 3287.60] the big a big one for women right there
[3285.20 - 3288.40] angel's rising i finally been able to

[3364.72 - 3369.84] every day
[3366.16 - 3374.16] charcoal is a way to eventually become
[3369.84 - 3377.44] super mineral and in vitamin deficient
[3374.16 - 3379.92] that's a doorway into
[3377.44 - 3381.36] vitamin mineral deficiencies it's like

[3400.24 - 3403.60] compound deficiencies the antioxidant
[3402.48 - 3405.84] deficiencies
[3403.60 - 3406.64] it is a nightmare why and i'll tell you
[3405.84 - 3408.96] why
[3406.64 - 3410.16] chad says acv did actually almost ruin
[3408.96 - 3413.76] my teeth
[3410.16 - 3415.92] yeah chad it's it
[3413.76 - 3417.12] young women don't know this right
[3415.92 - 3418.08] they're all about making sure their
[3417.12 - 3420.32] teeth are like super
[3418.08 - 3421.36] white like taking care of their teeth
[3420.32 - 3423.20] want them all straight
[3421.36 - 3425.52] right and they're doing the apple cider
[3423.20 - 3427.92] vinegar every single day
[3425.52 - 3430.32] and it's like it scares me because i
[3427.92 - 3432.72] want what people want if
[3430.32 - 3434.16] you want your teeth to be a certain way
[3432.72 - 3437.04] i want your teeth to be whatever you
[3434.16 - 3438.56] want them to be right if you want to be
[3437.04 - 3440.96] whatever you want to be i want to
[3438.56 - 3442.96] support that right but then i just watch
[3440.96 - 3444.88] this disaster happening it doesn't have
[3442.96 - 3448.00] to touch the teeth like i said already
[3444.88 - 3451.04] but it's it's i've watched this disaster
[3448.00 - 3454.16] happen the apple cider vinegar nightmare
[3451.04 - 3455.44] in the 20-something year olds and then i
[3454.16 - 3457.36] know that it's like
[3455.44 - 3459.68] it's hard when you know this stuff right
[3457.36 - 3461.20] it's hard you guys when you know
[3459.68 - 3463.28] and you're like okay you just did three
[3461.20 - 3463.84] years apple cider vinegar gummies and
[3463.28 - 3465.60] shots
[3463.84 - 3467.28] and you're 25 years old it's like okay
[3465.60 - 3469.60] when you're 35 you're gonna be in the
[3467.28 - 3471.28] dentist chair every single day
[3469.60 - 3473.44] and there's nothing you can say you know
[3471.28 - 3475.36] it's like see we hear i see that topical
[3473.44 - 3477.52] charcoal
[3475.36 - 3479.84] topical charcoal is is fine if you want
[3477.52 - 3482.96] to use charcoal topically for something
[3479.84 - 3486.32] yeah i mean if you want uh so
[3482.96 - 3489.60] but but internally like diges
[3486.32 - 3491.44] ingesting it right but the people i see
[3489.60 - 3493.20] with the teeth problems that come years
[3491.44 - 3495.12] later it's like yeah you've been doing
[3493.20 - 3496.88] the vinegars i don't know what to say
[3495.12 - 3499.12] you've been doing it what am i gonna do
[3496.88 - 3502.48] i can't stop you from doing it i can't
[3499.12 - 3506.96] i can't stop you i don't know what to do
[3502.48 - 3510.80] right but the charcoal suffocates
[3506.96 - 3514.08] absorption so it's
[3510.80 - 3517.44] so fine and it doesn't
[3514.08 - 3520.56] come out of your
[3517.44 - 3524.08] layer that layer that's on the
[3520.56 - 3527.60] inside the gut this layer right
[3524.08 - 3531.04] it suffocates and destroys
[3527.60 - 3534.80] like your cell
[3531.04 - 3536.00] um basically that that transfusion that
[3534.80 - 3539.52] occurs right
[3536.00 - 3542.40] with cells the absorption process
[3539.52 - 3542.88] and as a cell in your intestinal lining
[3542.40 - 3546.32] is
[3542.88 - 3550.08] is awaiting to absorb anything
[3546.32 - 3551.76] the charcoal is so fine it clogs up the
[3550.08 - 3555.28] cell it doesn't cleanse the cell
[3551.76 - 3557.84] it clogs it up it suffocates so when you
[3555.28 - 3559.52] when you do the internal charcoal and
[3557.84 - 3561.60] you're taking the supplements
[3559.52 - 3563.60] you coat your entire intestinal tract
[3561.60 - 3566.80] going all the way down to your colon
[3563.60 - 3569.04] with charcoal and it adheres it just
[3566.80 - 3570.48] cleans just like diatomaceous earth
[3569.04 - 3573.12] particles clings
[3570.48 - 3574.16] to the walls and it doesn't let
[3573.12 - 3577.12] nutrients
[3574.16 - 3579.52] go in it doesn't let the absorption
[3577.12 - 3581.60] absorption for you get malabsorption
[3579.52 - 3583.92] you're going to be pooping out all of
[3581.60 - 3586.48] your nutrients and not bringing them
[3583.92 - 3588.32] in it's a nightmare let's head to
[3586.48 - 3590.64] another one
[3588.32 - 3590.64] um
[3591.76 - 3599.68] soul seeker az
[3595.28 - 3602.08] um cheryl angela almost everyone i know
[3599.68 - 3603.12] in the wellness world pushes cacao and
[3602.08 - 3605.12] chocolate is
[3603.12 - 3606.88] healing and do all the ceremonies and
[3605.12 - 3610.00] it's so hard to witness
[3606.88 - 3611.52] um you know the problem is
[3610.00 - 3613.76] it could be because they're they're
[3611.52 - 3614.56] they're slaves to the caffeine industry
[3613.76 - 3618.40] you know
[3614.56 - 3622.24] it's the caffeine industry knows if you
[3618.40 - 3625.68] can if you can invade the healing
[3622.24 - 3628.08] sacred area of wellness right
[3625.68 - 3629.84] the caffeine industry knows if you can
[3628.08 - 3632.16] hit the yoga mamas
[3629.84 - 3634.16] if you can hit the yoga community if you
[3632.16 - 3637.60] can hit the spiritual community
[3634.16 - 3640.80] if you can saturate these communities
[3637.60 - 3642.00] into the sacred belief community right
[3640.80 - 3644.16] of sacred
[3642.00 - 3646.16] you know things being self-care sacred
[3644.16 - 3646.72] self-care sacred medicine sacred
[3646.16 - 3648.32] everything
[3646.72 - 3651.12] the caffeine industry knows that if you
[3648.32 - 3654.40] can you can get in there
[3651.12 - 3656.08] they're golden they just have to get in
[3654.40 - 3656.64] there and they have they've gotten in
[3656.08 - 3658.88] there right
[3656.64 - 3660.48] so you get all the cacao ceremonies you
[3658.88 - 3662.80] get all the you get all the
[3660.48 - 3664.24] you know you get all that going on so
[3662.80 - 3668.32] and what happens is
[3664.24 - 3671.28] it's basically an enslavement for women
[3668.32 - 3672.08] and it's just to basically keep them on
[3671.28 - 3675.12] caffeine
[3672.08 - 3676.40] for the rest of their lives and to think
[3675.12 - 3678.24] that i mean do you think eating
[3676.40 - 3680.16] chocolate is a great idea
[3678.24 - 3681.44] right you know what that does to
[3680.16 - 3684.48] everybody's mood up down
[3681.44 - 3686.56] up down up down crash burn crash burn

[3725.20 - 3733.92] of straight cacao are you okay
[3729.68 - 3736.80] you're jittery today really
[3733.92 - 3737.92] so everybody was just they were just
[3736.80 - 3741.52] like
[3737.92 - 3743.04] totally high yeah
[3741.52 - 3744.64] who what someone was talking about the
[3743.04 - 3747.28] stars
[3744.64 - 3748.16] well that sounds cool you guys were all
[3747.28 - 3750.64] talking about like
[3748.16 - 3752.80] the universe who said what about
[3750.64 - 3756.16] extraterrestrials
[3752.80 - 3758.24] really what ceremony was this
[3756.16 - 3759.36] it was a it was a really cool like
[3758.24 - 3762.32] sacred
[3759.36 - 3763.60] shaman plant medicine person was there
[3762.32 - 3766.72] she said that you should be drinking
[3763.60 - 3769.12] lots of cacao every day
[3766.72 - 3770.16] you feel like you can't why you feel
[3769.12 - 3771.76] like you're
[3770.16 - 3774.48] you're shaky and jittery and your
[3771.76 - 3774.48] adrenals like
[3774.56 - 3779.60] you're nauseous today why do you think
[3778.16 - 3781.20] but yet you want the chocolate really
[3779.60 - 3783.76] bad but
[3781.20 - 3785.20] you know it's not a good idea why is it
[3783.76 - 3787.28] not a good idea
[3785.20 - 3788.72] because you know it's you know it's not
[3787.28 - 3790.96] a good idea
[3788.72 - 3793.84] i gotcha so are you supposed to be on
[3790.96 - 3796.24] chocolate every single day
[3793.84 - 3798.56] and just be on highs and lows what
[3796.24 - 3803.20] happened you crashed really bad
[3798.56 - 3804.32] it's awful and then you are feeling good
[3803.20 - 3806.64] you feel like you don't even know who
[3804.32 - 3809.12] you are now like depersonalization
[3806.64 - 3810.72] maybe you just need a chocolate hit like
[3809.12 - 3812.96] another cacao hit
[3810.72 - 3814.32] and you can kind of find yourself and
[3812.96 - 3815.76] normalize
[3814.32 - 3817.60] but what happens when it starts wearing
[3815.76 - 3819.28] off then you're into this like weird
[3817.60 - 3821.04] depression again
[3819.28 - 3822.56] all right i'll talk about after the show
[3821.04 - 3825.20] we're live right now
[3822.56 - 3826.80] no i know i told you to call in i'm
[3825.20 - 3827.20] sorry about that but we got to cover the
[3826.80 - 3830.56] rest
[3827.20 - 3830.56] i got to talk about a little bit more
[3831.68 - 3836.56] the problem is with cacao is is that it
[3834.24 - 3839.44] blows your adrenals out so you age fast
[3836.56 - 3842.00] and so really what's happening is it's
[3839.44 - 3843.12] teaching women just to get their babies
[3842.00 - 3845.68] also on cacao
[3843.12 - 3847.44] everybody on cacao and can continue that
[3845.68 - 3849.60] life cycle of cacao right
[3847.44 - 3851.44] of the caffeine industry so that the
[3849.60 - 3853.20] shareholders can sit back
[3851.44 - 3854.96] and they know that the addiction itself
[3853.20 - 3857.28] takes care of it and no matter what
[3854.96 - 3858.48] you can be in financial ruin but you'll
[3857.28 - 3861.60] buy that chocolate
