[110.04 - 113.94] good stuff we got to celery juice right
[111.90 - 118.26] here we're doing I think the bottom line
[113.94 - 120.48] is is that you and I feel the same we
[118.26 - 122.88] feel the same way chronic illness is
[120.48 - 126.03] growing at an all-time high
[122.88 - 128.70] okay all-time high science and research
[126.03 - 131.73] can't keep up with it it just can't they
[128.70 - 132.75] can't keep up with it and more than not
[131.73 - 133.73] keeping up with it
[132.75 - 137.30] it is
[133.73 - 137.93] chronic diseases as if they were acute
[137.30 - 141.08] problems
[137.93 - 144.05] Yesi for acute problems like a broken
[141.08 - 145.82] bone a burst appendix a heart attack an
[144.05 - 148.04] ongoing heart attack there's nothing
[145.82 - 149.99] better than modern science yeah I agree
[148.04 - 153.44] but the problems that humanity is
[149.99 - 154.73] suffering from are not mostly acute 90%
[153.44 - 157.28] of the problems of humanity suffering
[154.73 - 160.10] from a chronic product yeah and they do
[157.28 - 162.35] not respond to surgery and medications
[160.10 - 164.84] the way that acute problems yeah so we
[162.35 - 166.46] are not really treating the the chronic
[164.84 - 168.59] problems we were just killing the
[166.46 - 170.41] symptoms yeah you know that's we you
[168.59 - 173.18] know what's amazing about that is is
[170.41 - 176.33] until somebody gets sick with a chronic
[173.18 - 178.52] condition with symptoms they have and
[176.33 - 180.26] they're not getting better and they're
[178.52 - 182.27] going to neurologist right you've seen
[180.26 - 183.86] this I mean come on how many times I've
[182.27 - 187.43] something arrives I mean you're a doctor
[183.86 - 188.66] I've seen myself yeah I got seven
[187.43 - 191.60] prescription medications for health
[188.66 - 193.19] issues that I was suffering from and it
[191.60 - 195.17] didn't make sense for me so I've looked
[193.19 - 197.03] for a different solution yeah and that
[195.17 - 205.61] took me to discover the power of what we
[197.03 - 207.65] eat and the power of herbs yeah and so
[205.61 - 209.03] the whole thing is it's like you know
[207.65 - 210.59] when people are dealing with exactly
[209.03 - 212.24] there's chronic symptoms are going to
[210.59 - 213.95] neurologist and they're going to another
[212.24 - 215.24] doctor then go another doctor and then
[213.95 - 217.22] they're going in all these different
[215.24 - 219.77] places and the whole life is based on
[217.22 - 222.59] doctor appointments and science and
[219.77 - 224.63] research it's great for nuts and bolts
[222.59 - 226.43] right I call it nuts and bolts you got a
[224.63 - 228.14] gallbladder because we don't take care
[226.43 - 230.27] of herself and we got an infection in
[228.14 - 232.43] the gallbladder and it's got to come out
[230.27 - 234.47] you want a good surgeon you want a good
[232.43 - 236.12] doctor you get heart problems you want a
[234.47 - 237.89] good heart doctor I mean that's what you
[236.12 - 240.08] are a heart doctor and you know and in
[237.89 - 242.45] an internist internal medicine doctor to
[240.08 - 244.73] all of that and you know you want that
[242.45 - 246.44] but but then what about all the other
[244.73 - 247.94] people because that's why you became an
[246.44 - 249.59] expert about chronic illness because
[247.94 - 251.60] what about all the other people that
[249.59 - 254.54] they can't get answers for all the
[251.60 - 257.33] problems they have with modern medicine
[254.54 - 261.05] is with chronic diseases in approaching
[257.33 - 263.33] chronic diseases is that we do not look
[261.05 - 266.32] for the root cause of the problem yeah
[263.33 - 269.20] we just very concentrated in
[266.32 - 271.12] cutting and and and pieces off and
[269.20 - 273.49] giving medications just to calm the
[271.12 - 276.10] symptoms right but the root problem
[273.49 - 279.10] cause of the problems is not what modern
[276.10 - 281.71] Western medicine is the best at yeah or
[279.10 - 284.14] gives any attention to the reason there
[281.71 - 286.21] is a big growing movement which is
[284.14 - 288.55] called functional medicine that that
[286.21 - 289.99] yeah that is what happens to modern
[288.55 - 291.94] medicine doctors when they start
[289.99 - 294.10] thinking like Ayurvedic or Chinese
[291.94 - 296.23] medicine doctors right and these are the
[294.10 - 297.91] doctors that are more interested in
[296.23 - 299.89] growth then they're more open to what
[297.91 - 302.26] could be wrong yeah what's happening
[299.89 - 304.72] inside the body how deep is the problem
[302.26 - 307.69] you know and that matters I mean back in
[304.72 - 309.43] the day you know back in the day like
[307.69 - 312.13] you know you've been a doctor for a long
[309.43 - 314.89] time okay so you mean you got experience
[312.13 - 317.50] and new doctors that come out of school
[314.89 - 320.74] fresh out of school and they just don't
[317.50 - 323.88] know a fraction of what you know because
[320.74 - 326.02] it takes that history sick people
[323.88 - 327.85] science and research doesn't have the
[326.02 - 329.71] answers for aches and pains tangles and
[327.85 - 332.38] numbness vertigo yeah eight you know
[329.71 - 334.24] neck pain mysterious back pain sciatica
[332.38 - 336.31] pain without back problems you know all
[334.24 - 339.07] of this and all these different things
[336.31 - 341.59] in the foggy head the brain fog right
[339.07 - 343.69] and the floaters in the eyes and then
[341.59 - 345.82] the fatigue and all that fatigue you
[343.69 - 348.19] come out of school and then all that
[345.82 - 350.38] what is what the hell is all that like
[348.19 - 352.60] what is all that right I mean the doctor
[350.38 - 354.34] said well you got the history you know
[352.60 - 356.38] you got that long-standing history that
[354.34 - 358.69] there needs to be more figured out to
[356.38 - 360.88] help people you know and it's doctors
[358.69 - 362.74] like you that you know they're rare
[360.88 - 364.93] there's not a lot of doctors like you
[362.74 - 367.21] out there that says you know what I'm
[364.93 - 368.98] gonna you know what I'm an expert at
[367.21 - 371.17] cardiology I'm an expert at these things
[368.98 - 373.81] in the field but you know what people
[371.17 - 375.31] are suffering you know he has compassion
[373.81 - 376.96] you know when I met you you could tell
[375.31 - 378.76] the story when I met you but he's a
[376.96 - 380.92] compassionate man he's a compassionate
[378.76 - 382.90] man about people suffering I don't see
[380.92 - 385.42] that too often I know doctors are
[382.90 - 387.61] compassionate they have to be but but it
[385.42 - 389.80] takes it to a new level with him because
[387.61 - 391.36] he actually really cares he said you
[389.80 - 393.58] know he said I remember when I first met
[391.36 - 395.20] you you said that science the research
[393.58 - 397.18] doesn't have all the answers okay
[395.20 - 398.17] because people are they're sick out
[397.18 - 400.72] there
[398.17 - 402.73] and we need to do something about it you
[400.72 - 405.22] were just looking on this remember you
[402.73 - 407.95] said I'm gonna dedicate my life that I
[405.22 - 411.49] met Anthony at a party for one of my
[407.95 - 413.44] book launch what in like 2009 2009 yeah
[411.49 - 415.51] it doesn't not longer than eight or nine
[413.44 - 418.03] okay and somebody brought in to me
[415.51 - 420.70] because people that are that I that I
[418.03 - 423.10] know intimately know that I am a healer
[420.70 - 424.60] Ruby some people are rock star groupies
[423.10 - 426.97] in there for a rock star I follow
[424.60 - 428.20] either's true healers right so they
[426.97 - 432.79] introduced me to him and they told me
[428.20 - 434.47] his story and I you know always even
[432.79 - 437.02] though I believe and I know that
[434.47 - 440.13] miracles exist and the spirit exists and
[437.02 - 442.63] and that it communicates with us I am
[440.13 - 443.05] initially a skeptic until proven
[442.63 - 445.87] otherwise
[443.05 - 449.05] ya know you're you're a hard man but I
[445.87 - 451.21] like this come from science that's the
[449.05 - 456.13] whole point so if it's gotta convince
[451.21 - 458.11] you it better be good because I like to
[456.13 - 461.47] look in your eyes and I knew that at
[458.11 - 464.02] least you believed what you told me you
[461.47 - 467.05] were not faking stuff right now it was
[464.02 - 471.28] then up to me to see if what you believe
[467.05 - 474.22] had something to do with a few months
[471.28 - 478.03] later I got a really big scare right I
[474.22 - 480.64] was having labor pains like really
[478.03 - 483.19] intense labor pains and I decided to
[480.64 - 485.89] give the medical medium a try so I
[483.19 - 488.02] called you and you said to me and I was
[485.89 - 490.96] already scheduled for the next day for a
[488.02 - 494.62] biopsy of my liver and I called you and
[490.96 - 496.78] you said first of all your liver has no
[494.62 - 499.51] problem you have an old cyst that you
[496.78 - 501.79] were born with and the reason and the
[499.51 - 503.71] reason that you are having pains has
[501.79 - 504.49] nothing to do the cysts so when they
[503.71 - 512.71] find the cyst
[504.49 - 515.20] don't worry about it so so and he put me
[512.71 - 517.54] on cats go if the cat's a cloth for the
[515.20 - 518.86] liver powerful what else need live
[517.54 - 521.05] around spirulina
[518.86 - 522.97] abundance of spirulina I put you on Mull
[521.05 - 524.89] and leaf because more than that wasn't
[522.97 - 527.11] the immune system of your liver to get
[524.89 - 529.16] stronger yeah and and and to be
[527.11 - 532.17] protective because your livers have
[529.16 - 534.33] immediately I ordered everything he put
[532.17 - 535.86] me on and the next day I went to have a
[534.33 - 541.38] biopsy and the results of the biopsy
[535.86 - 543.81] were not a biopsy yeah yeah sonogram I
[541.38 - 545.91] had about two of my lymph nodes and in a
[543.81 - 548.01] sonogram and a cat scan of my liver and
[545.91 - 550.50] basically they told me exactly that that
[548.01 - 552.21] I had a cyst they didn't want to touch
[550.50 - 553.83] it because they didn't think that was
[552.21 - 555.66] part of the problem yeah and then I
[553.83 - 557.94] received the next day all the things
[555.66 - 561.87] that you ordered and then four days
[557.94 - 565.35] later I had no more pain and then I
[561.87 - 567.39] started sending my well I consulted you
[565.35 - 569.28] about my kids I consulted you about my
[567.39 - 571.58] family I love how many members and then
[569.28 - 577.91] I started sending patients to you and
[571.58 - 580.56] like everybody had some benefit if not
[577.91 - 582.63] incredible benefit by seeing you want to
[580.56 - 584.85] follow your advice one more you know and
[582.63 - 587.01] and the thing is is is with you though
[584.85 - 590.07] when you when you know when I tell you
[587.01 - 592.11] hey Doc you gotta do this you gotta keep
[590.07 - 593.91] that you just you just do it you just do
[592.11 - 595.77] it you just said I'll go get what what
[593.91 - 598.74] do you need me to do immediately
[595.77 - 602.91] immediately you know and and because you
[598.74 - 606.63] believe that herbs you believe that food
[602.91 - 608.31] does heal and it does heal certain parts
[606.63 - 609.90] of her body survive it because you have
[608.31 - 612.06] that belief doctors didn't have that
[609.90 - 614.58] years ago you know when I you know it's
[612.06 - 617.61] a new thing now the doctors think food
[614.58 - 620.07] helps yeah I mean I mean I'm thirty
[617.61 - 622.02] years into this or more helping people
[620.07 - 623.79] out all these years and I tooked a lot
[622.02 - 625.32] of doctors over the years I've talked to
[623.79 - 627.18] angry doctors because they didn't
[625.32 - 629.13] believe no no garlic can't help with
[627.18 - 631.53] anything you can't you know you can't
[629.13 - 633.18] use garlic for the flu you can't use God
[631.53 - 636.36] you can't use this and now they just
[633.18 - 637.79] don't have any any faith my father was
[636.36 - 642.18] from Hungary
[637.79 - 645.42] used to tell me that garlic kept away
[642.18 - 649.04] the bad spirits right ya know I always
[645.42 - 649.04] knew that garlic was really it was
[649.96 - 655.24] really believe that nature did not
[652.33 - 657.52] design human body to get sick just like
[655.24 - 659.35] it didn't design anybody to get sick any
[657.52 - 661.39] animal animals in the wild don't get
[659.35 - 664.18] sick I love animals that live in the way
[661.39 - 666.10] that nature designed them to it in in
[664.18 - 668.32] the places in which nature designed them
[666.10 - 670.81] to live and eat what nature designed
[668.32 - 672.76] them to eat do not get sick okay we are
[670.81 - 675.73] the animals and and the cats and dogs
[672.76 - 679.00] that live close to us yes we get sick no
[675.73 - 681.64] yes no nature did not design humans or
[679.00 - 685.06] anything to get sick the sicknesses are
[681.64 - 688.48] just adaptation and survival mechanisms
[685.06 - 690.34] right and when we discover what the
[688.48 - 692.77] obstacles are and we remove the
[690.34 - 694.99] obstacles and then we add whatever is
[692.77 - 697.63] lacking everything corrects by itself
[694.99 - 699.82] you know it falls into exactly what I've
[697.63 - 702.85] been teaching from my information my
[699.82 - 705.43] source that you got to get rid of toxins
[702.85 - 708.79] you gotta get rid of toxins you got to
[705.43 - 712.15] get rid of bugs bugs toxins I always say
[708.79 - 714.25] that and and bugs feed off of toxins
[712.15 - 716.38] like heavy metals we're going to talk
[714.25 - 718.18] about heavy metals I got a little bit of
[716.38 - 719.68] a heavy metal detox movie right here so
[718.18 - 722.17] the medical medium heavy metal defense
[719.68 - 724.21] movie right there and you know bugs like
[722.17 - 727.09] the feed off of mercury they like the
[724.21 - 730.54] feed off of aluminum land arsenic copper
[727.09 - 733.18] and even more these heavy metals they
[730.54 - 735.82] depress you a new system so bugs can
[733.18 - 737.53] take over right otherwise sometimes we
[735.82 - 740.05] have the ability to kill all this and
[737.53 - 741.64] keep them away on these bugs by
[740.05 - 743.80] ourselves with our immune system now
[741.64 - 746.71] these heavy metals they tip the balance
[743.80 - 748.15] and they allow give bugs an advantage
[746.71 - 750.55] yeah and you know you know what's
[748.15 - 752.56] amazing is that we're made out of trace
[750.55 - 754.57] minerals you know we're making out of
[752.56 - 756.13] minerals it's in their bones it's
[754.57 - 758.53] everywhere trace minerals in our tissue
[756.13 - 760.33] connective tissue or organs we've got
[758.53 - 761.92] all these trace minerals you know we got
[760.33 - 763.06] the zinc with selenium we've got all
[761.92 - 764.53] these other trace minerals it's
[763.06 - 767.41] unbelievable what we have what we're
[764.53 - 771.07] made out of and metals toxic heavy
[767.41 - 775.47] metals they're a metal they're a metal
[771.07 - 775.47] out of the earth a toxic one
[777.81 - 783.17] manufacturer metals trace minerals are
[781.84 - 786.20] types of
[783.17 - 788.90] in a way minerals have that connection
[786.20 - 791.21] you have the metals they're reacting the
[788.90 - 794.03] minerals and then they in a they would
[791.21 - 796.04] they destroy our trace minerals metals
[794.03 - 798.68] destroy the weaken our immune system
[796.04 - 800.96] they break this down and then and they
[798.68 - 803.95] and they also work energetically in a
[800.96 - 807.49] negative for example don't talk about
[803.95 - 809.66] astrology and in Mercury's in retrograde
[807.49 - 812.90] so what has happened there's an
[809.66 - 816.71] energetic influence cool of mercury yeah
[812.90 - 821.57] that really puts your body in a pickle
[816.71 - 823.40] yeah yeah no totally agreed 100% exactly
[821.57 - 825.53] and and when you got the toxic heavy
[823.40 - 827.84] metals you can have some brain fog can
[825.53 - 829.19] have some anxiety could have migraines
[827.84 - 830.96] aches and pains
[829.19 - 832.64] well the main mechanism called mercury
[830.96 - 835.28] is called the great mimicry because it
[832.64 - 837.50] can mimic any disease it can mimic as a
[835.28 - 840.20] psychiatric problem as a skin disease as
[837.50 - 842.78] a gastroenterology problem as a heart
[840.20 - 845.06] problem it can mimic any disease so it
[842.78 - 847.85] is called a great mimicker and we need
[845.06 - 849.47] to find out because now everybody's
[847.85 - 851.87] exposed too much well you know we all
[849.47 - 854.96] have mercury in us from year from from
[851.87 - 857.48] generations past we tended earth yeah
[854.96 - 858.92] it's in the foods that we eat it's in
[857.48 - 860.48] the water that was showering with the
[858.92 - 862.16] industries the industry's been using
[860.48 - 862.85] mercury going all the way back hundreds
[862.16 - 865.04] in hundreds of years
[862.85 - 866.84] no no boys and it's oh it's innocent we
[865.04 - 869.03] passed it on down the family line if we
[866.84 - 870.77] don't get it out of us and the program
[869.03 - 873.23] then we're gonna keep on passing it
[870.77 - 877.42] around the process the problem is this I
[873.23 - 880.97] am now a true believer that
[877.42 - 885.20] detoxification is something that can
[880.97 - 887.30] save the the big picture and really
[885.20 - 890.06] bring chronic disease now well
[887.30 - 892.70] detoxification is used in a weird way
[890.06 - 894.56] too many people are using detox and this
[892.70 - 896.93] and detox that that's why functional
[894.56 - 898.79] medicine now changed the word and talks
[896.93 - 900.47] about it as biotransformation
[898.79 - 903.05] so basically is what the body already
[900.47 - 905.60] knows what to do getting toxic chemicals
[903.05 - 909.28] which 90% are lipophilic only dissolving
[905.60 - 911.48] fat and then throwing it through certain
[909.28 - 913.04] reactions in the liver first phase one
[911.48 - 915.29] detoxification phase phase two
[913.04 - 915.95] detoxification and turning them into a
[915.29 - 919.34] non
[915.95 - 920.84] toxic and water-soluble compound so that
[919.34 - 923.93] it can be excludable it's like having
[920.84 - 926.03] metals cannot yeah yes so so you can you
[923.93 - 929.54] can create the conditions for your body
[926.03 - 932.12] to detoxify by themselves by supporting
[929.54 - 934.04] the liver nutritionally by by doing
[932.12 - 938.03] certain things to reduce the workload of
[934.04 - 940.70] the digestive system and and and heavy
[938.03 - 942.50] metals with not so we can go might not
[940.70 - 944.45] get clean we we can cleanse other
[942.50 - 946.07] poisons and toxins out of us easy and
[944.45 - 947.93] most of them yeah most of them all right
[946.07 - 949.67] we can cleanse them out we do the right
[947.93 - 952.19] things with foods we do the right things
[949.67 - 955.75] with all the stuff but heavy metals
[952.19 - 959.27] rolling heavy metals they're stubborn
[955.75 - 962.72] they're really ineffective ways that we
[959.27 - 964.85] do get rid of anybody anybody who just
[962.72 - 967.31] came on dr. Alejandro younger right here
[964.85 - 970.04] and the cardiologists internist
[967.31 - 971.99] specialist give me a little history real
[970.04 - 973.52] quick like you know we're graduated all
[971.99 - 977.99] that it looked I was born in your away
[973.52 - 979.82] and and life was very healthy by default
[977.99 - 981.23] I went to medical school there then I
[979.82 - 983.57] moved to New York to do my internship
[981.23 - 985.76] and residency in internal medicine at
[983.57 - 987.77] NYU downtown Hospital incredible then I
[985.76 - 990.92] did my cardiology fellowship at Lenox
[987.77 - 993.70] Hill Hospital the hard core the change
[990.92 - 997.40] of lifestyle and especially with diet
[993.70 - 999.53] had me find myself after six years with
[997.40 - 1002.29] irritable bowel syndrome severe
[999.53 - 1004.54] depression and severe allergies I went
[1002.29 - 1006.70] to three specialists some of the top in
[1004.54 - 1008.95] New York I ended up with three diagnoses
[1006.70 - 1011.92] and seven prescription medications okay
[1008.95 - 1013.48] and I had two shocks one of them is my
[1011.92 - 1014.74] god I have to take seven prescription
[1013.48 - 1016.42] medications in order to be able to
[1014.74 - 1018.34] function for the rest of my life this is
[1016.42 - 1020.20] what medicine was telling me and the
[1018.34 - 1022.69] other shop was this is what I'm doing
[1020.20 - 1024.10] with my patients yeah so I took off yeah
[1022.69 - 1025.90] because you care about your patients I
[1024.10 - 1027.73] just saw what you always did I went to
[1025.90 - 1029.59] India to live in a monastery where I
[1027.73 - 1031.93] learned a little bit about herbal
[1029.59 - 1033.91] medicine Ayurvedic medicine and I
[1031.93 - 1036.97] started getting better you know yeah it
[1033.91 - 1038.11] was no processed foods yeah this thing
[1036.97 - 1039.64] is love
[1038.11 - 1041.59] you guys hear about you guys hear about
[1039.64 - 1044.14] processed foods all the time I bet all
[1041.59 - 1045.10] that in and we take it for granted we
[1044.14 - 1047.32] think that information
[1045.10 - 1049.30] always been out there it was never out
[1047.32 - 1050.89] there it was never really out there
[1049.30 - 1052.96] doctors are talking about stay away from
[1050.89 - 1055.39] processed foods now it kind of stems
[1052.96 - 1056.83] from basically sources like dr.
[1055.39 - 1058.42] Alejandro younger that's what's
[1056.83 - 1059.98] interesting I mean I'm going to talk
[1058.42 - 1063.43] about no processed foods for a long time
[1059.98 - 1065.83] I don't know processed foods yeah I call
[1063.43 - 1068.20] them food like products yeah food like
[1065.83 - 1070.24] products but we take that for everybody
[1068.20 - 1072.40] everybody including on YouTube and other
[1070.24 - 1074.20] places and then influence and stuff they
[1072.40 - 1075.43] they automatically if you they hear
[1074.20 - 1077.32] processed foods or they hear anything
[1075.43 - 1079.15] like that that's it's a no-brainer stay
[1077.32 - 1082.60] away from them it wasn't a no-brainer
[1079.15 - 1085.06] years ago it's men like dr. nada under
[1082.60 - 1087.13] younger that had a fight for it because
[1085.06 - 1089.17] when you know when when you had a pavé
[1087.13 - 1091.21] away its front earring and I had to pave
[1089.17 - 1093.73] the way in frontier I mean that the
[1091.21 - 1096.60] smack I got for trying to get people
[1093.73 - 1100.36] gluten-free 35 years ago was
[1096.60 - 1114.19] unbelievable untold agony I had to deal
[1100.36 - 1116.74] with that really caught my attention
[1114.19 - 1119.83] about you but still as a doctor though
[1116.74 - 1121.51] it was this is new ground you you you as
[1119.83 - 1123.61] a medical doctor you said you know what
[1121.51 - 1125.41] and this is early on for medical doctors
[1123.61 - 1127.18] with no processed food and no and none
[1125.41 - 1128.68] of those no no you know bad foods and
[1127.18 - 1131.50] all that I teach I teach my patients
[1128.68 - 1133.48] live longer than the life shelf of any
[1131.50 - 1135.88] product that you buy the shorter your
[1133.48 - 1137.83] life yeah I mean and then you know look
[1135.88 - 1139.51] and then you know you hear about doctors
[1137.83 - 1141.43] out there and they they just they
[1139.51 - 1143.02] graduated a few years ago they're in
[1141.43 - 1145.00] gastroenterology they're in something
[1143.02 - 1147.46] else they're doing something and they
[1145.00 - 1148.84] don't like all the natural information
[1147.46 - 1150.16] that's being spread out there about the
[1148.84 - 1150.76] medical medium and other stuff they
[1150.16 - 1152.47] don't like it
[1150.76 - 1154.90] because they they haven't had the
[1152.47 - 1156.88] experience of being like there's there
[1154.90 - 1159.22] isn't answers out there there just isn't
[1156.88 - 1160.96] answers there is but there is with a lot
[1159.22 - 1163.66] of procedures there is with a lot of
[1160.96 - 1166.54] medicine a good heart doctor priceless
[1163.66 - 1168.73] all this but but but when it comes down
[1166.54 - 1170.53] to broken bones and all kinds of
[1168.73 - 1172.21] injuries you get into this you get into
[1170.53 - 1173.44] there's all kinds of things but when it
[1172.21 - 1177.16] comes down to what people are
[1173.44 - 1179.38] the Crohn's colitis IBS got a
[1177.16 - 1182.50] gastrointestinal disorders that are that
[1179.38 - 1185.35] are not fixable by just cotton snip or a
[1182.50 - 1187.72] medication that's when we get in trouble
[1185.35 - 1190.87] it's all those things the chronic
[1187.72 - 1194.02] diseases of the modern world cannot be
[1190.87 - 1195.88] treated like the acute diseases surgery
[1194.02 - 1199.42] and medications are great for the acute
[1195.88 - 1202.30] diseases but humanity problems are only
[1199.42 - 1203.56] ten percent are cubes ninety percent of
[1202.30 - 1206.80] the problems you're suffering from are
[1203.56 - 1209.29] the chronic problems in which you got to
[1206.80 - 1211.66] go back to the where the root cause of
[1209.29 - 1214.30] proteins and for most of them is in the
[1211.66 - 1216.04] gut yeah exactly I want to ask for heavy
[1214.30 - 1217.54] metals or bugs yeah and we're gonna talk
[1216.04 - 1219.70] about heavy metals we know how to get
[1217.54 - 1221.05] them out a little bit in all that to
[1219.70 - 1223.12] we'll go into that a little bit but I
[1221.05 - 1224.47] wanted to ask you about the science and
[1223.12 - 1226.33] research part that's really interesting
[1224.47 - 1229.93] like it's all interesting but the part
[1226.33 - 1231.40] where you know what science thinks it
[1229.93 - 1234.13] has it right for a little while and then
[1231.40 - 1236.71] it changes its tune new years later it
[1234.13 - 1238.30] changes it soon and then it's these are
[1236.71 - 1240.64] people that are people that are
[1238.30 - 1242.59] gravitating to studies here and then the
[1240.64 - 1245.05] studies here but they they keep on
[1242.59 - 1247.00] changing so no matter what scientific
[1245.05 - 1249.25] study you got I'm even in heart
[1247.00 - 1251.80] procedures heart surgeries they were
[1249.25 - 1253.57] different back then they would cut the
[1251.80 - 1255.73] whole chest wide open they would snip
[1253.57 - 1257.20] all the ribs right down here I mean they
[1255.73 - 1259.57] would cut them open at your spread your
[1257.20 - 1261.70] whole ribcage out now they're doing
[1259.57 - 1263.17] they're doing Valerie play some us an
[1261.70 - 1265.27] under some of them still someone who's
[1263.17 - 1267.88] still happy but but um for example look
[1265.27 - 1270.58] at what happened with the war on food in
[1267.88 - 1273.91] America yeah when I came to America in
[1270.58 - 1277.03] the 90s early nineties there was a war
[1273.91 - 1279.34] on fat everything was fat free from in
[1277.03 - 1282.61] the supermarkets so they had to replace
[1279.34 - 1284.98] the calories with carrots yeah right now
[1282.61 - 1287.64] at carbide a few years later made
[1284.98 - 1290.11] mistakes with that whole later
[1287.64 - 1292.48] carbohydrates became the enemy yeah and
[1290.11 - 1294.79] so we waged a war on carbohydrates and
[1292.48 - 1296.68] then now we're in the honeymoon with fat
[1294.79 - 1297.86] everybody who's loaded for any changes
[1296.68 - 1301.05] and then it
[1297.86 - 1305.00] and in so many studies that show
[1301.05 - 1307.50] definitely results for certain
[1305.00 - 1309.57] approaches that medic modern medicine
[1307.50 - 1313.59] takes a few years later or 10 years
[1309.57 - 1315.33] later shown to be wrong yeah cuz you
[1313.59 - 1317.58] tell me the but they could find
[1315.33 - 1320.04] something they're looking for yeah and
[1317.58 - 1322.44] stay with that but then look and then
[1320.04 - 1324.63] the rest falls apart a researcher and we
[1322.44 - 1326.43] actually end up finding what they're
[1324.63 - 1327.84] looking for yeah but they only look for
[1326.43 - 1329.79] what they already know they already
[1327.84 - 1331.98] exact so we don't know what they're
[1329.79 - 1333.63] looking for it's like okay so celery
[1331.98 - 1335.31] juice helping out a lot you've seen
[1333.63 - 1338.79] celery juice help out a lot of people I
[1335.31 - 1342.33] saw you prescribing to patients in front
[1338.79 - 1344.73] of me that improved later by taking the
[1342.33 - 1346.08] celery juice but science research they
[1344.73 - 1347.01] don't know anything about celery juice
[1346.08 - 1348.87] because they don't even know what
[1347.01 - 1350.49] they're looking for yet they don't look
[1348.87 - 1351.93] for so people be out there oh it's got
[1350.49 - 1353.73] this vitamin and it's got this mineral
[1351.93 - 1354.96] it's got a little bit of this set but
[1353.73 - 1356.52] that's not why people are getting better
[1354.96 - 1358.14] because all the fruits and vegetables
[1356.52 - 1359.58] and other foods and even animal products
[1358.14 - 1362.73] have vitamins and minerals in it and
[1359.58 - 1364.26] that's not this gets people better the
[1362.73 - 1366.39] thing is this you can you cannot argue
[1364.26 - 1369.15] with success and you can see and you see
[1366.39 - 1370.95] the results all over the world in how
[1369.15 - 1372.90] many thousand hundreds of thousands of
[1370.95 - 1375.78] people that are because of you taking
[1372.90 - 1378.48] celery juice right yeah so now senator
[1375.78 - 1381.21] juice doesn't need a study well maybe
[1378.48 - 1383.40] yes but but what are the downsides of
[1381.21 - 1386.01] taking Saturday juice there's a downside
[1383.40 - 1387.96] in taking medications there's a risk but
[1386.01 - 1390.87] there's no risk in taking senator so why
[1387.96 - 1393.72] not try exactly why not try and the
[1390.87 - 1396.51] thing is is I always find the organic
[1393.72 - 1398.91] studies organic studies are lots of
[1396.51 - 1400.77] people drinking celery juice their skin
[1398.91 - 1402.36] is clearing up their eczema psoriasis is
[1400.77 - 1404.34] clearing up the brain fog is going away
[1402.36 - 1406.65] their their anxieties dropping down
[1404.34 - 1408.84] there's third there bloating goes down
[1406.65 - 1410.52] their digestive system gets strong you
[1408.84 - 1412.74] kind of argue would success all these
[1410.52 - 1414.78] things are happening neurological
[1412.74 - 1416.01] disorders are reversing celery juice
[1414.78 - 1417.69] when you're drinking it right at the
[1416.01 - 1421.05] right dosages and you're doing all that
[1417.69 - 1423.27] all the stuffs happening and that's the
[1421.05 - 1426.00] study see that's the study that's not
[1423.27 - 1427.62] paid for that's what I love about that
[1426.00 - 1429.87] that's the study that's not paid for
[1427.62 - 1432.21] that's the organic study that
[1429.87 - 1434.31] those truth and that who's gonna waste
[1432.21 - 1436.38] money for research
[1434.31 - 1444.63] instead you know because there's mainly
[1436.38 - 1446.73] money maybe it's innate maybe the so
[1444.63 - 1449.70] many juices a nice or because basically
[1446.73 - 1450.45] what it does it hurts the pockets of the
[1449.70 - 1452.82] industries
[1450.45 - 1454.98] you can't bankroll off of it you can't
[1452.82 - 1457.62] bet you can't make like billions of
[1454.98 - 1459.63] dollars off it unless every fun acting
[1457.62 - 1462.72] Center is so yeah but they get like one
[1459.63 - 1465.99] penny one penny I talked to a couple
[1462.72 - 1468.00] selling farmers and they said listen
[1465.99 - 1470.73] there's no money in this you're making
[1468.00 - 1472.62] us do all this work we have to feed this
[1470.73 - 1474.72] so we have to get the all the natural
[1472.62 - 1476.07] organic fertilizers we got to get all
[1474.72 - 1477.45] these things and when you have the
[1476.07 - 1479.04] equipment you're making us
[1477.45 - 1482.66] that's what you know a farmer said to me
[1479.04 - 1488.18] you're making us lease 20 more tractors
[1482.66 - 1490.71] and and we're not making any money off I
[1488.18 - 1492.90] think it's the middleman I think it's
[1490.71 - 1495.41] not the farmers a new supermarket that
[1492.90 - 1497.49] are delivering it to probably to a
[1495.41 - 1500.10] supermarket it's good you know it's
[1497.49 - 1502.35] funny because they remember you know you
[1500.10 - 1504.42] know and by the way it's going for
[1502.35 - 1506.19] somebody to make money yeah on something
[1504.42 - 1508.26] that's good yeah yeah that's you know
[1506.19 - 1510.03] that's a reward from from the universe
[1508.26 - 1511.74] you know I mean people would say hey
[1510.03 - 1513.87] what's your history where do you come
[1511.74 - 1515.52] from a little bit like with me and stuff
[1513.87 - 1517.02] I don't talk about myself ever it's
[1515.52 - 1518.40] always about people it's about people
[1517.02 - 1522.27] making sure they get the right things
[1518.40 - 1524.88] yeah but spending a lifetime in Maine
[1522.27 - 1526.56] and in that state and then the fisherman
[1524.88 - 1529.14] out there with the lobstering and all
[1526.56 - 1531.15] that stuff and I got that history in my
[1529.14 - 1533.55] family and everything that family my
[1531.15 - 1535.22] family line and and what happens is that
[1533.55 - 1538.14] you don't make the money
[1535.22 - 1540.15] catching the lobster of the fish the guy
[1538.14 - 1541.77] that takes it to wherever he thinks it
[1540.15 - 1543.30] next to he picks it up and he takes a
[1541.77 - 1545.07] store he's a guy making money so I think
[1543.30 - 1547.08] in the celery world's probably some
[1545.07 - 1548.79] other place that's the same thing you
[1547.08 - 1551.04] actually you're making the money
[1548.79 - 1552.84] actually you know transporting it and
[1551.04 - 1554.55] then the supermarket probably make some
[1552.84 - 1556.14] money to the farmers they're not making
[1554.55 - 1558.81] money I've had farmers tell me we're
[1556.14 - 1560.91] killing ourselves to keep up with the
[1558.81 - 1562.54] celery juice at that you know but they
[1560.91 - 1564.28] know it's healing people
[1562.54 - 1566.29] because they're drinking it too farmers
[1564.28 - 1567.82] are like I'm gonna drink this and it's
[1566.29 - 1569.53] healing people and everything and that's
[1567.82 - 1571.66] the results you know the results are
[1569.53 - 1574.24] what that is it's about this the organic
[1571.66 - 1575.47] study in that organic study I mean you
[1574.24 - 1577.00] have to remember that so if you're doing
[1575.47 - 1580.12] something that's helping you in your
[1577.00 - 1582.31] life that's that's what where it counts
[1580.12 - 1583.63] that's where it counts I remember you
[1582.31 - 1585.01] know visiting a doctor friend of mine
[1583.63 - 1586.81] years and years years ago he said we'll
[1585.01 - 1588.61] come to my office for I have lunch right
[1586.81 - 1590.56] it's a long time it I think was like the
[1588.61 - 1591.97] mid 90s or early nineties that come to
[1590.56 - 1593.08] my office we'll have some lunch you just
[1591.97 - 1594.82] gotta wait for a little while I have to
[1593.08 - 1596.23] finish up with a couple patients so I
[1594.82 - 1597.79] was waiting around out there and he had
[1596.23 - 1600.25] a television inside his waiting room
[1597.79 - 1604.27] area in a television in there and it was
[1600.25 - 1608.14] saying garlic was bad for you bad for
[1604.27 - 1611.68] you meanwhile there was a there was a
[1608.14 - 1614.20] report on mainstream media I think a
[1611.68 - 1617.23] couple of years before that in like 1989
[1614.20 - 1620.50] 1990 that garlic was good for you and
[1617.23 - 1622.12] then but garlic's bad for you so
[1620.50 - 1623.71] something was found out in science of
[1622.12 - 1625.87] garlic's bad for you and then garlic
[1623.71 - 1628.33] became good for you again and now it
[1625.87 - 1632.41] then became bad for you it's just this
[1628.33 - 1634.42] is is it on purpose why is this done you
[1632.41 - 1636.82] know what I mean it's like I mean you
[1634.42 - 1638.53] you know better than I as a physician
[1636.82 - 1640.06] you know but I mean you're an expert
[1638.53 - 1642.52] cardiologists you're an expert doctor
[1640.06 - 1644.50] you you know why why is it like that
[1642.52 - 1645.97] because because first of all first of
[1644.50 - 1648.31] all there's in there's economic
[1645.97 - 1649.84] interests in many of the studies but
[1648.31 - 1652.42] also there's there's mistakes there's
[1649.84 - 1654.55] the way that you design a study and then
[1652.42 - 1657.61] the way that you interpret a study will
[1654.55 - 1660.61] have a huge difference between the you
[1657.61 - 1664.09] know one result or or another okay so so
[1660.61 - 1666.25] you know research it's very important
[1664.09 - 1668.17] but you gotta be careful when when you
[1666.25 - 1670.33] interpret it yeah so that's that's what
[1668.17 - 1673.33] happens you know it's incredible I mean
[1670.33 - 1676.42] I know there's a lot of people and they
[1673.33 - 1678.55] stand behind science and research but I
[1676.42 - 1681.31] think that I noticed that when they
[1678.55 - 1683.92] haven't seen twenty doctors and I
[1681.31 - 1685.90] haven't seen five neurologists and I
[1683.92 - 1688.12] haven't seen all these other people
[1685.90 - 1690.49] right and they haven't been through what
[1688.12 - 1693.10] all you guys have been through because I
[1690.49 - 1695.77] mean you know dr. Junger I mean the
[1693.10 - 1697.87] people in the audience here I mean they
[1695.77 - 1699.97] there they got the aches and pains they
[1697.87 - 1701.47] get the Hashimoto's thyroiditis and now
[1699.97 - 1703.57] they get the fatigue then they get the
[1701.47 - 1705.88] lime diagnosis then they get something
[1703.57 - 1708.43] else and they they've been doctor now
[1705.88 - 1710.86] they've been doctor it out you know and
[1708.43 - 1713.77] in and it's like and put the people in
[1710.86 - 1716.74] notice too haven't gotten sick yet but
[1713.77 - 1719.14] just by chance by chance in a lot of
[1716.74 - 1721.39] ways it just weren't the toxins didn't
[1719.14 - 1723.37] overflow yet or something didn't go
[1721.39 - 1725.41] wrong yet and by chance or they didn't
[1723.37 - 1727.33] pick up a new pathogen or a new bug or
[1725.41 - 1729.22] something or or an old bug in their
[1727.33 - 1731.98] system didn't flourish and take over
[1729.22 - 1733.75] something something you know Medes made
[1731.98 - 1736.15] it so they're just still okay enough
[1733.75 - 1737.62] they'll get sick later but they're still
[1736.15 - 1740.35] okay enough those are the people I
[1737.62 - 1742.90] notice that are like Oh hogwash rubbish
[1740.35 - 1744.82] hogwash on this hogwash on that they're
[1742.90 - 1746.92] not critics they become haters instead
[1744.82 - 1748.72] because they believed so strongly the
[1746.92 - 1751.48] science has figured everything out you
[1748.72 - 1753.97] know and everything else the body is the
[1751.48 - 1756.94] house we've been given right but it's
[1753.97 - 1758.77] not their body we're renting it and and
[1756.94 - 1761.41] it's not until people get the eviction
[1758.77 - 1763.78] notice right the diagnosis then they
[1761.41 - 1766.06] start looking for different solutions so
[1763.78 - 1768.01] yeah I know I know the people that are
[1766.06 - 1772.81] watching because I deal with them and
[1768.01 - 1775.42] I've helped many of them reach restore
[1772.81 - 1777.85] their natural ability to heal themselves
[1775.42 - 1781.09] by detoxifying by choosing the right
[1777.85 - 1782.56] foods by by using our Vedic medicine
[1781.09 - 1785.35] principles functional medicine
[1782.56 - 1789.21] principles intermittent fasting mixing
[1785.35 - 1791.41] all these things to to really help
[1789.21 - 1793.33] remove the obstacles and provide
[1791.41 - 1793.87] whatever is lacking so the body can heal
[1793.33 - 1795.70] itself
[1793.87 - 1797.71] you know in a doctor youngers a really
[1795.70 - 1800.38] humble guy you know what's it's it's
[1797.71 - 1802.24] funniest thing cuz you know I I look to
[1800.38 - 1804.34] him to keep my I try to check myself
[1802.24 - 1806.89] thing a little bit in the sense where
[1804.34 - 1808.51] you know he says you gotta be humble and
[1806.89 - 1811.45] he tells me you gotta be humble you
[1808.51 - 1813.13] gotta he knows I get I get I get upset
[1811.45 - 1815.26] about things I get passionate about
[1813.13 - 1817.51] things and he's always like look you
[1815.26 - 1819.82] gotta you gotta check check that out the
[1817.51 - 1821.50] door a little bit and you gotta stay
[1819.82 - 1823.75] compassionate you gotta stay humble
[1821.50 - 1825.10] you're always reminding me why don't you
[1823.75 - 1826.51] know I I don't think I have to remind
[1825.10 - 1828.82] you to stay compassionate
[1826.51 - 1831.40] who are you are kind of the embodiment
[1828.82 - 1834.01] of compassion yourself but what I what I
[1831.40 - 1836.44] what I am saying is that we we cannot
[1834.01 - 1838.09] forget that there is a space for science
[1836.44 - 1840.67] right yeah yeah and there is a huge
[1838.09 - 1842.92] space also for what science doesn't know
[1840.67 - 1843.94] yeah and and and we have to take the
[1842.92 - 1846.46] best out of everything
[1843.94 - 1848.71] yeah and sure we're gonna deny one way
[1846.46 - 1850.57] or not exactly and that I love because
[1848.71 - 1852.34] there's things in science that offers is
[1850.57 - 1854.59] amazing I talk about that all the time I
[1852.34 - 1856.72] talk about my books you talk about it in
[1854.59 - 1858.85] your books and you know there's there
[1856.72 - 1860.95] it's a powerful nugget science does have
[1858.85 - 1863.50] so much to offer and but but
[1860.95 - 1865.36] compassionate doctors like dr. Junger
[1863.50 - 1866.98] that no there's you guys have suffered
[1865.36 - 1868.63] and struggled you know that's the whole
[1866.98 - 1870.88] thing that you guys have really been
[1868.63 - 1871.96] through a lot that's what counts because
[1870.88 - 1873.85] that's the only way we're ever gonna
[1871.96 - 1875.41] move forward that's the only way we're
[1873.85 - 1877.69] ever gonna move forward is if if
[1875.41 - 1879.37] professionals you know that that have
[1877.69 - 1880.87] the degrees like you do and have the
[1879.37 - 1883.18] training that you do and then the
[1880.87 - 1885.19] experience and expertise know that you
[1883.18 - 1886.66] guys are really struggling and that all
[1885.19 - 1888.55] the answers are on out there and then
[1886.66 - 1889.81] that our bodies the temple we got to get
[1888.55 - 1891.19] the foods we've got to get the right
[1889.81 - 1893.26] things we've got to get the herbs we get
[1891.19 - 1894.91] all these things in all matters and that
[1893.26 - 1896.59] that's what's incredible I want to talk
[1894.91 - 1899.29] about the metals because the metals are
[1896.59 - 1902.91] such the metals are such in the way
[1899.29 - 1905.14] they're sent in such a toxic a toxic
[1902.91 - 1906.49] element that's in the way of people's
[1905.14 - 1909.31] healings and I want to talk about that
[1906.49 - 1911.05] to get them out but before we before we
[1909.31 - 1912.85] tell them how to make take them out tell
[1911.05 - 1914.38] them how they get in yeah right well
[1912.85 - 1915.76] what's your and what's your perception
[1914.38 - 1918.52] of hag what's your opinion and
[1915.76 - 1920.80] everything and we use them in so many
[1918.52 - 1923.47] things I mean do you remember or write
[1920.80 - 1926.32] about my Hatter's disease these to use
[1923.47 - 1928.63] mercury in shaping hats so when you put
[1926.32 - 1930.91] the hat on and you absorb mercury into
[1928.63 - 1933.10] your system yeah and here's the thing I
[1930.91 - 1934.60] put it on cosmetics okay the Mad
[1933.10 - 1935.23] Hatter's disease I want to talk about
[1934.60 - 1936.88] that a little bit
[1935.23 - 1940.00] you guys don't wear a hat laced in
[1936.88 - 1942.64] mercury you know but your forefathers
[1940.00 - 1944.59] did and it's passed on through utero and
[1942.64 - 1947.23] you know from sperm and egg it's passed
[1944.59 - 1949.87] on that's how it's done
[1947.23 - 1953.23] mercury gets passed on down the line
[1949.87 - 1955.57] every generation until you get it out so
[1953.23 - 1959.01] yeah yeah someone wore a hat back
[1955.57 - 1963.16] 19:20 with mercury and oh you know but
[1959.01 - 1966.49] even if you were from your environment
[1963.16 - 1969.40] the furniture that we buy is treated
[1966.49 - 1973.30] with having met with LED and sure yeah
[1969.40 - 1977.08] then the lacquer lacquer metals in it so
[1973.30 - 1979.63] yes recently lipstick had mercury and
[1977.08 - 1981.46] lead and so some some the cosmetics we
[1979.63 - 1984.40] use the air we breathe the water we
[1981.46 - 1987.04] drink and showered with but mostly the
[1984.40 - 1989.32] the foods that we are loaded with
[1987.04 - 1990.25] chemicals that a loner in communication
[1989.32 - 1992.23] would cause some kind of learning
[1990.25 - 1994.51] problem exam and the heavy metals are a
[1992.23 - 1996.28] big part of it and the thing is this if
[1994.51 - 1998.56] you don't help the body get rid of the
[1996.28 - 2000.33] heavy metals it won't catch up with it
[1998.56 - 2005.97] so that's why I love that you came up
[2000.33 - 2008.25] with with the ingredients here I used to
[2005.97 - 2009.75] recommend them separately but what
[2008.25 - 2011.25] better than get them all together yeah
[2009.75 - 2012.72] you get them all together you guys you
[2011.25 - 2014.94] guys know about the heavy metal detox
[2012.72 - 2017.31] smoothie of medical medium it's that you
[2014.94 - 2019.17] got the cilantro you need that you got
[2017.31 - 2021.39] the barley grass cheese powder you need
[2019.17 - 2023.70] that you got the spirulina you need that
[2021.39 - 2025.47] the wild blueberries you go get your
[2023.70 - 2026.82] frozen wild blueberries it's critical
[2025.47 - 2028.68] because people be like well how do I get
[2026.82 - 2031.14] the metals out how do I get them out
[2028.68 - 2032.82] frozen wild blueberries not the regular
[2031.14 - 2035.40] blueberries they can't pull them out but
[2032.82 - 2037.89] the frozen wild ones do the wild sea
[2035.40 - 2039.84] wild food has different things going on

[2073.59 - 2078.90] eat all the different colors as I
[2077.52 - 2081.36] learned from a colleague of mine called
[2078.90 - 2081.94] you're gonna get something good in you
[2081.36 - 2083.47] that way
[2081.94 - 2085.66] no matter what is it what's been
[2083.47 - 2088.57] happening this is the variability of
[2085.66 - 2091.06] colors in your diet the bigger the
[2088.57 - 2094.03] variability of your gut flora which is
[2091.06 - 2097.60] now known to be really important part of
[2094.03 - 2099.97] your body system so especially for
[2097.60 - 2102.46] detoxification yeah the good intestinal
[2099.97 - 2104.65] flora will detoxify half of the toxins
[2102.46 - 2107.02] that you're exposed to if it's if it's a
[2104.65 - 2108.85] healthy yeah bio yeah and it gets beaten
[2107.02 - 2110.92] down by the toxins too so it gets beaten
[2108.85 - 2112.39] down and that's a whole other thing and
[2110.92 - 2114.55] we get inflamed the thing is with the
[2112.39 - 2116.26] gut and she's got the pathogens in there
[2114.55 - 2118.09] you got the streptococcus which will end
[2116.26 - 2119.95] up giving you a SIBO diagnosis you got
[2118.09 - 2122.29] bacteria in there that could you know
[2119.95 - 2124.00] it's hiding behind rancid proteins that
[2122.29 - 2126.01] are up on the linings of the intestinal
[2124.00 - 2128.32] tract you know you got those things and
[2126.01 - 2130.06] you end up feeding it with gluten and
[2128.32 - 2131.59] you end up feeding it with eggs you
[2130.06 - 2132.88] gotta be careful you guys don't do and
[2131.59 - 2134.74] you do chicken eggs you'll feed
[2132.88 - 2137.53] everything you know I always tell
[2134.74 - 2140.92] everybody all the bugs were raised in
[2137.53 - 2143.56] labs a long time ago and eggs were used
[2140.92 - 2145.78] as the food eggs are a food for these
[2143.56 - 2147.55] bugs and if they have eggs and you know
[2145.78 - 2150.25] to feed the food you know feed the bugs
[2147.55 - 2152.11] so what is it that the bugs love love
[2150.25 - 2154.72] the eggs they love the eggs we train
[2152.11 - 2156.34] train the scrambled eggs yeah we train
[2154.72 - 2157.39] you know and in people if you don't have
[2156.34 - 2158.92] a lot of bugs in you in the moment
[2157.39 - 2160.99] you're young you feel indestructible
[2158.92 - 2162.76] sure hey just say you're doing eggs it
[2160.99 - 2165.43] might be okay but you get older you get
[2162.76 - 2167.14] older and things hit and I you just have
[2165.43 - 2168.58] to get you into your 30s and you start
[2167.14 - 2170.11] getting more problems and you start
[2168.58 - 2172.45] getting acne and you start getting you
[2170.11 - 2174.73] know it's so the metals are one thing
[2172.45 - 2176.32] the bugs wheat the bad foods we've got
[2174.73 - 2178.03] to know what foods to stay away from
[2176.32 - 2179.62] you're an expert at what foods to stay
[2178.03 - 2181.63] away from you've been teaching at all
[2179.62 - 2183.31] these years I'm it's incredible I can't
[2181.63 - 2184.81] believe I have dr. l/100 younger here
[2183.31 - 2186.97] for people that just came on we're live
[2184.81 - 2188.86] right now and that's how we like to do
[2186.97 - 2191.62] what we like to do with live I don't
[2188.86 - 2193.84] like to edit things I like it alive you
[2191.62 - 2196.36] know and hey if I make a mistake I make
[2193.84 - 2197.56] a mistake if I you know if I fall off my
[2196.36 - 2199.60] chair I fall off my chair
[2197.56 - 2201.73] I'm just glad we're here this is
[2199.60 - 2204.13] incredible and I just want to talk about
[2201.73 - 2205.87] his folks for a quick second and he did
[2204.13 - 2207.79] a book called clean gut you guys could
[2205.87 - 2210.10] always check that out incredible clean
[2207.79 - 2211.57] the original that's the original book
[2210.10 - 2213.43] that's when you were like you know what
[2211.57 - 2214.81] I'm gonna just I'm gonna do this I'm
[2213.43 - 2217.33] gonna get the word out to the world
[2214.81 - 2220.69] right there the thing is that that I was
[2217.33 - 2222.94] discovering you have when you support
[2220.69 - 2224.77] the detoxification systems that we
[2222.94 - 2226.63] already have yeah and are trying to do
[2224.77 - 2228.34] their work but they can't because our
[2226.63 - 2230.05] foods are devoid of nutrients and
[2228.34 - 2232.12] because our digestive systems are
[2230.05 - 2234.61] working all the time therefore stealing
[2232.12 - 2237.34] energy from the detoxification systems
[2234.61 - 2239.05] then then when you create the conditions
[2237.34 - 2240.49] and you support the liver and the other
[2239.05 - 2242.92] organs to do the work of detoxification
[2240.49 - 2245.89] it was just incredible what people who
[2242.92 - 2248.59] are getting better off from right and I
[2245.89 - 2250.69] got still called because the book he's
[2248.59 - 2252.79] known as many languages as yours but
[2250.69 - 2254.74] it's in a 20-something language you know
[2252.79 - 2256.63] it's in a lot of and I get and I get
[2254.74 - 2259.21] messages from all over the world ten
[2256.63 - 2261.37] years later telling me I did the 21-day
[2259.21 - 2263.86] program and I got better from this and
[2261.37 - 2266.41] that and I still surprised to learn to
[2263.86 - 2272.11] hear about how many different chronic
[2266.41 - 2274.12] problems people get better and then my
[2272.11 - 2275.44] new one yeah that's the new one coming
[2274.12 - 2279.34] out the new one coming out how to look
[2275.44 - 2283.54] out for that one to applying principles
[2279.34 - 2285.49] from function you know there's something
[2283.54 - 2288.97] else I want to tell you guys too is is
[2285.49 - 2291.49] that uh dr. Junger
[2288.97 - 2293.83] he wrote the foreword to the first
[2291.49 - 2295.69] medical medium book so I was honored
[2293.83 - 2298.93] when he did this this was a big deal for
[2295.69 - 2301.09] me it meant all the world to me because
[2298.93 - 2302.86] he's a famous doctor he's a famous
[2301.09 - 2304.60] cardiologist and you know and he said
[2302.86 - 2305.29] you know what I'm gonna do the foreword
[2304.60 - 2307.93] for your book
[2305.29 - 2309.52] well and it was yeah that really helped
[2307.93 - 2311.11] me it really really helped to me because
[2309.52 - 2312.52] it helped me get the information out to
[2311.11 - 2315.28] you guys and help me get the information
[2312.52 - 2316.87] out to the world me I don't I don't he
[2315.28 - 2318.73] called me one day and say hey listen I
[2316.87 - 2320.41] know that you have a lot to risk you're
[2318.73 - 2322.06] a medical doctor maybe you shouldn't be
[2320.41 - 2324.55] talking about these things but I wrote a
[2322.06 - 2330.25] book and I want to see if you would be
[2324.55 - 2331.84] willing to write because I I said well
[2330.25 - 2333.67] let me check it out cuz I didn't want to
[2331.84 - 2334.64] write a foreword for for anything just
[2333.67 - 2338.03] because I like you
[2334.64 - 2340.58] I read the book and I was blown away and
[2338.03 - 2342.29] that's why I wrote and by the way people
[2340.58 - 2345.50] call me from all over the world because
[2342.29 - 2348.83] of that of that forward and at many
[2345.50 - 2355.10] times even royalty from Europe call me
[2348.83 - 2358.13] to see if they can get all of you and
[2355.10 - 2359.71] when you did that forward you know and I
[2358.13 - 2361.94] I couldn't thank you enough because
[2359.71 - 2364.19] because I talk about controversial
[2361.94 - 2365.78] things in that book and we you know we
[2364.19 - 2367.34] talk about controversial things and
[2365.78 - 2368.93] that's what it is about mystery illness
[2367.34 - 2370.97] about chronic illness about why you're
[2368.93 - 2374.06] sick about why you have the symptoms and
[2370.97 - 2375.92] by the way he's a gentleman and he
[2374.06 - 2377.24] returned the favor no not the favorite
[2375.92 - 2380.54] how you gave me the book and I said I
[2377.24 - 2388.88] only want you to write a foreword if you
[2380.54 - 2390.32] really like it and he did right and so I
[2388.88 - 2392.36] just want to tell you guys that there is
[2390.32 - 2394.10] hope for healing that mean that's what
[2392.36 - 2396.38] that's what it's about that's what we're
[2394.10 - 2398.63] doing here you know you gotta pull the
[2396.38 - 2400.43] medals out get your gut better talk
[2398.63 - 2402.23] about that but it's an honor having me
[2400.43 - 2404.42] here man I I don't even know what to say
[2402.23 - 2405.68] and I really appreciate it and I really
[2404.42 - 2407.93] feel like this is gonna help a lot of
[2405.68 - 2409.73] people because they're hearing about the
[2407.93 - 2411.83] gun that you Haley they're hearing about
[2409.73 - 2413.99] their body being this temple and we rent
[2411.83 - 2416.24] it we rent out this body we can get an
[2413.99 - 2420.71] eviction notice if we're not you know
[2416.24 - 2422.63] that's how I know this is an eviction
[2420.71 - 2424.88] notice that's the only time when people
[2422.63 - 2426.86] get serious and start making changes
[2424.88 - 2430.01] right that's true but the problem is
[2426.86 - 2432.32] this we know now that the chronic
[2430.01 - 2435.92] diseases that we're suffering from all
[2432.32 - 2439.01] over the world start years before in a
[2435.92 - 2441.65] silent mode and they start by turning on
[2439.01 - 2444.44] the inflammatory system by the way which
[2441.65 - 2446.72] 80% is around the gut within and around
[2444.44 - 2450.26] the guys so your inflammation can be
[2446.72 - 2453.74] turned on for 15 years before the real
[2450.26 - 2456.32] disease is diagnosed absolutely so start
[2453.74 - 2458.66] don't don't wait for symptoms even even
[2456.32 - 2461.30] if even if they're minor symptoms don't
[2458.66 - 2463.55] wait for them to get worse or other
[2461.30 - 2466.87] symptoms to appear or chronic diseases
[2463.55 - 2469.49] to be diagnosed start now
[2466.87 - 2471.29] powerful powerful exactly it's what
[2469.49 - 2472.67] happens with Hashimoto's thyroiditis it
[2471.29 - 2474.83] started out with Epstein Barr in your
[2472.67 - 2477.38] system and then percolated in their
[2474.83 - 2479.66] proliferated over the years and also now
[2477.38 - 2481.64] you're 32 you're 35 you're 42 you get
[2479.66 - 2483.11] your you gave your hypothyroid diagnosis
[2481.64 - 2485.06] the doctors worried about your thyroid
[2483.11 - 2487.19] and that's because he had the viral
[2485.06 - 2489.68] infection the Epstein Barr deep down in
[2487.19 - 2492.35] there in your system a long time ago and
[2489.68 - 2494.36] if we knew if we just know that we can
[2492.35 - 2495.89] we can really avoid things and of course
[2494.36 - 2497.81] if we get a problem we could work on
[2495.89 - 2499.70] healing it reversing it make sure you
[2497.81 - 2501.61] drink your celery juice make sure you do
[2499.70 - 2506.33] all the good stuff we're talking about
[2501.61 - 2508.58] and remember and remember your body has
[2506.33 - 2510.41] the ability to heal each I love that
[2508.58 - 2511.82] that gets me kind of choked up right now
[2510.41 - 2513.77] well that's right that's what that's how
[2511.82 - 2516.65] nature design nature did not design
[2513.77 - 2519.56] diseases right disease is what we known
[2516.65 - 2521.63] as diseases are just adaptation and
[2519.56 - 2524.63] survival mechanisms that your body put
[2521.63 - 2526.97] on in order to defend itself in and
[2524.63 - 2527.57] survive right and they've been there for
[2526.97 - 2529.67] too long
[2527.57 - 2531.11] for example heart disease which affects
[2529.67 - 2534.11] everybody what is it
[2531.11 - 2536.39] it's the blockage of arteries right by
[2534.11 - 2537.95] cholesterol yeah but at the beginning in
[2536.39 - 2539.51] the beginning it starts because there's
[2537.95 - 2542.12] a little fissure in the artery in the
[2539.51 - 2545.36] body it patches it up good cholesterol
[2542.12 - 2547.79] now if if the fissure is healed and you
[2545.36 - 2548.99] know the smoking and the bad fats and
[2547.79 - 2551.75] then the stress and the high blood
[2548.99 - 2554.44] pressure are taken away from the from
[2551.75 - 2556.67] the picture the the the body we
[2554.44 - 2557.84] reabsorbed that lack of cholesterol and
[2556.67 - 2560.51] then everything will be fine
[2557.84 - 2562.49] but because the irritating factors the
[2560.51 - 2565.25] toxins the heavy metals them let's just
[2562.49 - 2567.08] keep on there the body keeps on patching
[2565.25 - 2568.07] keeps on patching keeps on patching as a
[2567.08 - 2570.35] survival mechanism
[2568.07 - 2573.14] eventually the patching will block the
[2570.35 - 2577.49] flow of blood and that's when heart
[2573.14 - 2581.06] disease is diagnosed right so so this is
[2577.49 - 2583.72] our survival mechanism and if you get to
[2581.06 - 2588.02] understand how to remove the obstacles
[2583.72 - 2590.75] bugs heavy metals stress bad thoughts
[2588.02 - 2593.15] bad company you remove the obstacles and
[2590.75 - 2596.48] you add what is lacking which is usually
[2593.15 - 2598.25] a nutrient yeah
[2596.48 - 2601.37] good nutrients
[2598.25 - 2605.09] then everything results by itself and
[2601.37 - 2607.91] the body is able to regain its ability
[2605.09 - 2609.71] its natural ability to heal itself you
[2607.91 - 2613.07] know in remember and that's coming from
[2609.71 - 2614.93] you know an expert cardiologist right
[2613.07 - 2616.94] here an expert cardiologists right here
[2614.93 - 2619.28] means powerful piece of information and
[2616.94 - 2621.41] it's just it's it's you know they have
[2619.28 - 2623.30] that right here is amazing you know just
[2621.41 - 2624.59] remember it's like exactly the doctor
[2623.30 - 2626.06] your eyes are saying is your body can
[2624.59 - 2628.46] heal there's so many of you that have
[2626.06 - 2631.52] been sick for a long time and you forget
[2628.46 - 2633.53] what it's like to feel good and some of
[2631.52 - 2635.39] you have never felt good and it breaks
[2633.53 - 2637.46] my heart you never had that moment in
[2635.39 - 2639.71] your life where you felt good and then
[2637.46 - 2641.51] and because you've started out sick you
[2639.71 - 2643.70] started out with symptoms you know there
[2641.51 - 2646.28] weren't it's or it's rare times you
[2643.70 - 2648.77] remember you felt good and and and and
[2646.28 - 2651.80] don't get lost in that I know it's it's
[2648.77 - 2653.96] it's easy for me to say and when you're
[2651.80 - 2655.31] going through it it's hard it's hard but
[2653.96 - 2657.32] they hear it from me it probably easy
[2655.31 - 2658.88] it's easy for me to say hey just hang in
[2657.32 - 2661.49] there but no it's more than that know
[2658.88 - 2663.65] that I care and I really want you to
[2661.49 - 2666.14] hang in there because I want you to know
[2663.65 - 2667.76] that you can heal and you will it's just
[2666.14 - 2669.29] you're gonna you're gonna learn from the
[2667.76 - 2670.76] medical medium serious books you learn
[2669.29 - 2672.53] from dr. younger suppose you just learn
[2670.76 - 2675.98] and we're gonna make sure we help you in
[2672.53 - 2679.55] any way we can I mean I would go even
[2675.98 - 2682.37] further and it's this I see the planet
[2679.55 - 2684.29] as a living organism as an animal as it
[2682.37 - 2686.39] were right and the rivers are like the
[2684.29 - 2689.39] arteries and the forests are like the
[2686.39 - 2692.96] lungs and and and the cells that are
[2689.39 - 2695.45] running around right are you and me
[2692.96 - 2697.07] so people are the cells of this organism
[2695.45 - 2700.09] right and and if you look at this
[2697.07 - 2703.85] organism this the planet it has a fever
[2700.09 - 2706.70] global warming is not anything else but
[2703.85 - 2709.34] a symptom it's you know so so where is
[2706.70 - 2711.65] this symptom coming from and in in my
[2709.34 - 2713.84] opinion the majority of the problem is
[2711.65 - 2716.09] the toxicity of our breath yeah it's
[2713.84 - 2718.58] excessively not only the toxins the air
[2716.09 - 2719.99] we breathe the water we drink and shower
[2718.58 - 2722.18] with the cosmetics we use the
[2719.99 - 2723.71] medications we take right but most of
[2722.18 - 2725.63] the foods that way that food a lot of
[2723.71 - 2726.42] yeah you know I didn't have to worry
[2725.63 - 2729.12] about you coming
[2726.42 - 2731.73] with clone on cuz cologne cologne just
[2729.12 - 2733.20] it's just it's so strong you know when
[2731.73 - 2736.35] people work alone it's they stay away
[2733.20 - 2737.91] from it's toxic and and and if you know
[2736.35 - 2739.47] and some people don't like the smell I
