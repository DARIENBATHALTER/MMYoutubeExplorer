[108.56 - 113.52] protected and strong
[111.04 - 115.52] is what needs to happen so everybody's
[113.52 - 116.96] systems need to be protected and strong
[115.52 - 118.48] you'll see i keep on saying systems
[116.96 - 120.40] right exactly you guys know what i'm
[118.48 - 122.32] talking about right you know what system
[120.40 - 124.08] i'm talking about

[138.88 - 142.56] person's not feeling good that person's
[140.64 - 144.56] coming down with something that person's
[142.56 - 146.24] coming down with something so how can we
[144.56 - 149.12] protect ourselves
[146.24 - 151.12] and how can we protect our own systems
[149.12 - 152.88] so i just wanted to do a little reminder
[151.12 - 154.72] i've said it was coming i said there's
[152.88 - 156.64] been a lot of people
[154.72 - 157.68] not feeling good
[156.64 - 159.68] and that's where we're going to be
[157.68 - 160.96] heading into a wave of that i talked
[159.68 - 162.88] about this months and months ago you
[160.96 - 165.36] guys you guys know
[162.88 - 166.80] i saw it coming not because i'm smart or
[165.36 - 168.24] anything like that it's only because of
[166.80 - 169.76] my source right
[168.24 - 172.08] uh spirit of compassion was telling me
[169.76 - 174.00] that it was coming in the late fall in
[172.08 - 175.92] the winter and that's what i was saying
[174.00 - 178.88] to everybody so what do we do like what
[175.92 - 180.24] do we do like what do we do to look out
[178.88 - 181.92] for ourselves so if you can't get
[180.24 - 183.44] supplements right can't get the right
[181.92 - 185.68] supplementation

[283.84 - 289.76] having them do the zinc right now i'm
[286.56 - 291.76] like make sure you do two dropper holes
[289.76 - 294.32] in the morning you do two dropper holes
[291.76 - 296.32] later on in the day or at night
[294.32 - 298.40] since i'm telling family right now so
[296.32 - 300.72] just two dropper holes twice a day you
[298.40 - 302.48] could be somebody you can do six tiny
[300.72 - 304.40] drops and then
[302.48 - 306.64] because i'm seeing it out there too
[304.40 - 309.64] i got people contacting me like oh my
[306.64 - 309.64] god

[316.72 - 320.72] you got to do the the zinc shock therapy
[319.36 - 321.68] i do the medical medium zing shock
[320.72 - 323.52] therapy
[321.68 - 326.24] okay and that's important right there
[323.52 - 327.92] you two dropper fools every three hours
[326.24 - 330.00] you can do that two dropper holes every
[327.92 - 332.40] three hours zing shock therapy
[330.00 - 334.24] and so that's what i'm telling friends
[332.40 - 335.68] and family i'm hearing it out there all
[334.24 - 339.12] over the place everybody's running
[335.68 - 342.08] themselves down this is the time of year
[339.12 - 345.12] people run themselves down greatly and
[342.08 - 346.72] then you got the critters going around
[345.12 - 348.96] and everybody's got the critters going
[346.72 - 350.96] around so that's something you know that
[348.96 - 352.40] we have to look out for
[350.96 - 354.24] you're doing zinc every day clara
[352.40 - 355.84] amazing that's so good so what i'm doing
[354.24 - 357.76] right here is the zinc so i'm going to
[355.84 - 358.72] just start setting myself up with a shot
[357.76 - 359.68] all right
[358.72 - 362.16] so
[359.68 - 364.80] i'm putting two dropper holes
[362.16 - 367.60] in that shot glass right there
[364.80 - 369.68] so i got two dropper holes in there okay
[367.60 - 371.68] and then i'm doing some cats claw you
[369.68 - 374.24] ask your doctor what's right for you
[371.68 - 377.28] well this is the vimergy brand
[374.24 - 380.48] so it's v as in victor i am as in marye
[377.28 - 383.52] rgy.com i'm not sponsored
[380.48 - 386.88] i'm not sponsored quality matters
[383.52 - 389.36] it matters it's just the brand i love
[386.88 - 391.28] and i know these guys you know become
[389.36 - 393.52] good friends with them throughout the
[391.28 - 394.80] years because of what they've done and i
[393.52 - 396.40] reach out to all the supplement
[394.80 - 397.92] companies and all the different
[396.40 - 400.00] companies out there and i try to become
[397.92 - 402.88] friends with them so then
[400.00 - 404.80] then they can respect what i'm asking
[402.88 - 407.04] them to like make sure that the stuff
[404.80 - 408.32] stays clean to make sure the quality is
[407.04 - 410.56] there to make sure they don't cut
[408.32 - 412.72] corners to make sure there's no citric
[410.56 - 414.64] acid to make sure there's no fillers in
[412.72 - 415.68] there to make sure there's nothing bad
[414.64 - 417.36] in there
[415.68 - 419.36] and so what i love about the vimergy
[417.36 - 422.80] company is they went above that they've
[419.36 - 424.56] even superseded anything i've ever asked
[422.80 - 426.08] anything i've ever questioned they
[424.56 - 427.60] superseded
[426.08 - 429.36] way above
[427.60 - 430.64] and they're just like no we we we're
[429.36 - 432.32] going to take it to a level no one's
[430.64 - 434.16] ever seen before in our history of the
[432.32 - 435.92] supplement world so that's why i use
[434.16 - 438.48] those henna says yes quality matters
[435.92 - 441.20] remedy supplements are the purest
[438.48 - 442.80] so cat's claw is what i do too
[441.20 - 444.32] that's one right there i just do a
[442.80 - 446.56] little cat's claw i just put a dropper
[444.32 - 448.40] full there but you know what a friend

[477.20 - 481.68] so vimergy put out this incredible olive
[479.52 - 482.56] leaf that just
[481.68 - 484.56] just
[482.56 - 486.08] goes over anything i've ever seen out
[484.56 - 487.52] there in the olive leaf world so that's
[486.08 - 488.96] what's incredible about this one and
[487.52 - 491.12] that one i'm really excited about
[488.96 - 494.24] because i've been able to offer friends
[491.12 - 496.48] and family something else that's really
[494.24 - 499.28] potent for what we're dealing with right
[496.48 - 501.52] now so what we're dealing with right now
[499.28 - 503.36] so anyway the olive leaf
[501.52 - 504.56] incredible stuff right there i'm going
[503.36 - 506.56] to do a couple things so i'm going to
[504.56 - 508.72] make some time water

[510.96 - 514.56] over here i'm going to do the medical
[512.16 - 516.16] medium vitamin c shock therapy too so
[514.56 - 518.72] i'm going to do some olive leaf right
[516.16 - 520.16] there putting two dropper fulls in there
[518.72 - 521.92] if you guys don't know vimergy it's
[520.16 - 523.44] vimergy i'm not sponsored it's just the
[521.92 - 525.60] stuff is that good
[523.44 - 527.84] and you'll see i'm always talking about
[525.60 - 529.92] vimergy uh mostly lately in the
[527.84 - 531.60] supplement world because what happens is
[529.92 - 533.20] with supplement companies they're all
[531.60 - 535.04] trying to cut corners
[533.20 - 536.64] and ever since the whole thing that
[535.04 - 538.64] happened right the whole thing that
[536.64 - 540.24] happened in the last couple years with
[538.64 - 542.48] what we're dealing with
[540.24 - 543.68] um it's it the supplement companies out
[542.48 - 545.76] there because i've been talking to a lot
[543.68 - 547.36] of them just doing like some balance and
[545.76 - 548.80] check with them like are you keeping out
[547.36 - 550.72] the natural flavors are you keeping out
[548.80 - 553.04] the citric acid to these other companies
[550.72 - 554.16] and they're like look aw we can't be
[553.04 - 556.00] perfect
[554.16 - 557.68] you wouldn't believe i was
[556.00 - 558.64] i can't say the name of the supplement
[557.68 - 560.40] company
[558.64 - 563.60] but i had a meeting with a supplement
[560.40 - 566.88] company last week right and it was to be
[563.60 - 568.48] like look you guys i can show your stuff
[566.88 - 569.44] because they asked they asked me to show
[568.48 - 572.16] their stuff
[569.44 - 574.00] if you take out this and this and this
[572.16 - 575.28] you can't have the citric acid in there
[574.00 - 576.96] you can't have the natural flavors in
[575.28 - 580.24] there and this is what this is what the
[576.96 - 582.88] ceo said to me the ceo said this to me
[580.24 - 585.44] look anthony that's what he said to me
[582.88 - 590.28] we can't be perfect we have good quality
[585.44 - 590.28] stuff but we can't be perfect i said
[590.48 - 593.84] but you said it
[592.08 - 595.28] that's fine with me then
[593.84 - 596.96] uh see you later they're like where are
[595.28 - 598.24] you going i go i gotta get off this
[596.96 - 601.20] phone call they're like where are you
[598.24 - 603.20] going we waited a long time to talk to
[601.20 - 605.04] you i'm like you just said you can't be
[603.20 - 607.44] perfect if i'm going to be recommending
[605.04 - 609.28] something to my people it's got to be as
[607.44 - 611.36] good as bimergy
[609.28 - 612.56] it has to be as good it has to they're
[611.36 - 614.56] like we can't be perfect you don't
[612.56 - 615.92] understand the bottom line we can't
[614.56 - 616.88] afford this or can't afford that i'm
[615.92 - 619.52] like
[616.88 - 621.68] i get it i get it you don't want to rise
[619.52 - 623.76] up to that occasion
[621.68 - 626.40] anyway so the vimergy stuff is why i've
[623.76 - 628.08] been showing it so much because of these
[626.40 - 630.72] are some of the reasons that's the
[628.08 - 632.96] licorice i'm gonna put some licorice in
[630.72 - 634.64] what i love about the licorice is
[632.96 - 637.20] it's so good
[634.64 - 639.60] it's so good for you for so many reasons
[637.20 - 641.84] um i'm actually running low on that one
[639.60 - 646.24] i can't believe how low actually on that
[641.84 - 648.96] one but yeah i just love licorice
[646.24 - 651.04] shamima says thank you aw you are our

[755.60 - 761.20] is the potency
[757.44 - 763.68] so it's ten to one right
[761.20 - 765.68] highly potent so all all the people i
[763.68 - 768.40] know out there that reach out to me and
[765.68 - 771.12] they're like i got really crazy anxiety
[768.40 - 772.80] my anxiety is out of control i'm like do
[771.12 - 775.20] you have the ten to one
[772.80 - 777.84] just keep that with you right there and
[775.20 - 779.76] just you just pull that out
[777.84 - 782.08] boom
[779.76 - 784.08] shoot some of that in
[782.08 - 785.60] that ten to one
[784.08 - 788.64] that that stuff
[785.60 - 788.64] that's potent like
[788.80 - 792.96] the thing is with the ten to one lemon
[790.32 - 796.16] balm when it's a quality like this
[792.96 - 796.16] is that when you send it down
[797.20 - 802.32] you don't need
[798.84 - 803.60] pot you don't need pot
[802.32 - 804.80] people who are possible i'm not a pot
[803.60 - 806.96] smoker
[804.80 - 808.08] but people are pot smokers
[806.96 - 810.72] like
[808.08 - 812.88] send down the ten to one
[810.72 - 815.28] and you're not gonna need pot
[812.88 - 816.48] just give it some time
[815.28 - 817.76] everybody who's like addicted to
[816.48 - 819.12] marijuana and everybody's addicted to
[817.76 - 820.80] marijuana out there because it's a big
[819.12 - 821.76] people just smoking it left and right
[820.80 - 823.52] right
[821.76 - 824.88] they even kept at the same price so if
[823.52 - 826.40] energy kept the same price right
[824.88 - 829.20] companies would never do that companies
[826.40 - 831.52] don't make the ten to one
[829.20 - 833.04] so because when i was talking to the ceo
[831.52 - 835.04] of this other supplement company that
[833.04 - 837.44] was reaching out to me
[835.04 - 839.92] and and and i said can you do any ten to
[837.44 - 841.12] one or like no no way in hell we can
[839.92 - 842.96] never do that
[841.12 - 844.56] we could never do that we'd have to
[842.96 - 846.32] charge a billion dollars for it i'm like
[844.56 - 847.84] you guys are just so lame anyway they
[846.32 - 848.64] kept it the same price but it's ten to
[847.84 - 850.08] one
[848.64 - 851.68] but i know everybody's smoking marijuana
[850.08 - 854.16] these days because i know i hear about
[851.68 - 858.96] it 24 7 out there right
[854.16 - 860.96] and i'm like try a ten to one lemon balm
[858.96 - 862.32] for the nervous system and brain for the
[860.96 - 864.80] central nervous system for the brain
[862.32 - 867.44] stem and then you might be able to
[864.80 - 869.04] actually give up your pot addiction
[867.44 - 871.12] you might be able to give up your pot
[869.04 - 872.56] addiction we're talking about building
[871.12 - 874.00] up our system because of everything
[872.56 - 875.84] happening right now so i got to stay on
[874.00 - 877.20] track talking about pot right now might
[875.84 - 879.60] not be the
[877.20 - 881.76] most productive thing
[879.60 - 883.36] so let's let's let's talk about the
[881.76 - 885.60] vitamin c
[883.36 - 886.40] that's the microc
[885.60 - 889.04] so
[886.40 - 891.52] i wasn't going to do a live for a while
[889.04 - 894.00] because i got a lot going on
[891.52 - 895.44] but i'm getting phone calls
[894.00 - 897.52] and texts
[895.44 - 900.64] left and right people i haven't talked
[897.52 - 901.92] to in years that are coming down with
[900.64 - 903.44] the critter
[901.92 - 906.64] right now they're coming down with a
[903.44 - 908.32] case of the critters they got the chills
[906.64 - 910.40] they don't feel good they got the
[908.32 - 912.80] temperature they're coughing they got
[910.40 - 914.16] the sniffles they got all that so
[912.80 - 915.44] they're coming down with a case of the
[914.16 - 918.32] critters and
[915.44 - 919.84] and so that's why and i know that a lot
[918.32 - 921.12] of people are up against that right now
[919.84 - 922.56] with the holiday and everything so i
[921.12 - 925.20] just wanted to cover just a couple
[922.56 - 927.76] little things about it
[925.20 - 930.40] so we got the the micro c so we do two
[927.76 - 930.40] 500
[932.08 - 935.92] this is vitamin c shock therapy you guys

[935.92 - 939.20] let me move stuff over
[937.52 - 942.56] right
[939.20 - 942.56] we can do that right in here
[944.00 - 948.48] so i'm going to open up two capsules
[946.24 - 950.40] right
[948.48 - 953.20] do this every two hours
[950.40 - 955.28] every waking two hours you got something
[953.20 - 956.72] happening you're coming down with
[955.28 - 958.08] something
[956.72 - 960.48] you're coming down the case of the
[958.08 - 960.48] critters
[961.52 - 965.68] do the microc two capsules every two
[963.84 - 967.44] hours that's what i would do do what
[965.68 - 969.76] your doctor tells you i'm just telling
[967.44 - 971.44] you what i recommend family and friends
[969.76 - 973.76] so what i just put in there with two
[971.44 - 976.08] capsules of the microc
[973.76 - 978.96] it's of emerging microc easiest stuff on
[976.08 - 979.92] the stomach and the most potent
[978.96 - 981.76] right
[979.92 - 983.92] cheryl says aw what is the reason you
[981.76 - 986.08] take the tinctures separately
[983.92 - 987.92] well what it is here is the tinctures i
[986.08 - 990.40] drop the tinctures in here

[1170.80 - 1173.84] said to people i've always said to
[1172.32 - 1175.52] family i've always said to friends you

[1356.00 - 1359.12] this is from
[1357.52 - 1361.84] freshly
[1359.12 - 1364.88] juiced elderberries
[1361.84 - 1368.80] this is from juiced elderberries
[1364.88 - 1368.80] all elderberry syrups
[1368.88 - 1372.72] are
[1370.40 - 1375.20] they're dried
[1372.72 - 1377.52] and then boiled
[1375.20 - 1379.36] so there's a big difference right there
[1377.52 - 1380.96] so this is the vimergio library syrup
[1379.36 - 1384.16] the other difference in the elderberry
[1380.96 - 1386.84] syrup here it's got mulberry extract
[1384.16 - 1389.36] so it's got a highly
[1386.84 - 1391.28] medicinal charge to it with that
[1389.36 - 1393.92] mulberry tree
[1391.28 - 1395.60] mulberries from the big mulberry trees
[1393.92 - 1397.84] put into here too so it's got the
[1395.60 - 1401.52] mulberry extra extract
[1397.84 - 1404.00] in with the elderberry that's juiced
[1401.52 - 1405.76] with vitamin c
[1404.00 - 1407.68] and there's nothing out there like it so
[1405.76 - 1409.36] this is basically
[1407.68 - 1410.88] what i love about like the vimergy
[1409.36 - 1412.16] elderberry syrup and it's got the micro
[1410.88 - 1414.08] seen it what i love about the vimergy
[1412.16 - 1415.12] elderberry syrup is
[1414.08 - 1417.44] they're like
[1415.12 - 1418.96] the forefront
[1417.44 - 1420.80] everybody's talking a good game out
[1418.96 - 1422.72] there like do this do this because of
[1420.80 - 1424.88] what's going on out there do this
[1422.72 - 1427.04] because of all the you know the what
[1424.88 - 1429.20] people are up against it's like really
[1427.04 - 1432.00] no these guys are like
[1429.20 - 1432.72] all the way on the forefront leading the
[1432.00 - 1434.96] way
[1432.72 - 1436.88] companies can't touch them they can't
[1434.96 - 1437.76] touch them like they couldn't even do
[1436.88 - 1439.12] this
[1437.76 - 1440.72] it wouldn't be possible for them to
[1439.12 - 1442.16] create this product companies could
[1440.72 - 1443.60] never do it
[1442.16 - 1446.00] they would have to charge a billion
[1443.60 - 1448.00] dollars i'm just exaggerating for that
[1446.00 - 1449.44] but they have to charge
[1448.00 - 1450.64] so much
[1449.44 - 1451.76] and they couldn't do it anyway they
[1450.64 - 1454.24] wouldn't have that they wouldn't have
[1451.76 - 1456.88] the connections or the technology so
[1454.24 - 1459.44] there's no cane sugar in here
[1456.88 - 1461.84] so that's important to know
[1459.44 - 1463.68] there's no cane sugar in here
[1461.84 - 1467.04] so this is
[1463.68 - 1469.52] literally a forefront product to build a
[1467.04 - 1471.20] system that no one has ever
[1469.52 - 1474.32] seen before
[1471.20 - 1476.88] and if they didn't do that i wouldn't be
[1474.32 - 1478.80] sitting here talking about it but it's
[1476.88 - 1481.20] they're just they're creating things
[1478.80 - 1483.28] that i can't help but to talk about
[1481.20 - 1485.04] because it's like that it's off the
[1483.28 - 1486.80] chart so when you're talking about
[1485.04 - 1488.00] mulberry extract
[1486.80 - 1490.00] and then
[1488.00 - 1492.40] juiced elderberry
[1490.00 - 1495.20] and then
[1492.40 - 1498.64] honey instead of cane syrup
[1495.20 - 1500.80] a cane sugar honey instead of cane sugar
[1498.64 - 1504.00] and then micro c
[1500.80 - 1505.92] all in an elderberry syrup
[1504.00 - 1506.80] you can't there's like you can't touch
[1505.92 - 1508.96] that
[1506.80 - 1510.80] you can do one tablespoon of this stuff
[1508.96 - 1514.64] you can do
[1510.80 - 1517.60] two tablespoons of this stuff you can do
[1514.64 - 1519.36] a day i'm telling if you're sick i mean
[1517.60 - 1521.36] i would be like a tablespoon three times
[1519.36 - 1523.12] a day if you're sick i mean that's what
[1521.36 - 1525.52] i would do if i was sick and i was
[1523.12 - 1529.60] coughing and i would had a sore throat i
[1525.52 - 1532.88] mean immune was down low low low low low
[1529.60 - 1535.76] but definitely so it's just
[1532.88 - 1537.52] no one can touch this product
[1535.76 - 1540.16] i'm just letting you guys know and
[1537.52 - 1541.52] that's the vimergy all the berries syrup
[1540.16 - 1545.20] and
[1541.52 - 1545.20] i always i always say it's like
[1545.28 - 1548.80] basically the bottom line when it comes
[1547.04 - 1551.04] down to it i'm like
[1548.80 - 1553.28] how do you battle darkness right and
[1551.04 - 1555.68] darkness is
[1553.28 - 1557.52] what creates all the sickness out there
[1555.68 - 1559.84] that's what darkness does right well how
[1557.52 - 1561.84] do you battle it you need companies that
[1559.84 - 1563.76] are light workers
[1561.84 - 1566.56] and that's the thing out there they're
[1563.76 - 1568.64] not just in it for profit and it's just
[1566.56 - 1571.60] profit alone right you need companies
[1568.64 - 1573.44] that are light workers that say well we
[1571.60 - 1576.08] can battle
[1573.44 - 1579.60] that darkness by doing something the
[1576.08 - 1582.64] darkness did not expect
[1579.60 - 1585.28] the darkness did not expect
[1582.64 - 1587.44] like weapons like this
[1585.28 - 1590.08] so darkness creates
[1587.44 - 1593.28] what you see out there happening right
[1590.08 - 1594.48] with all the games and all the different
[1593.28 - 1596.96] critters
[1594.48 - 1598.64] that everybody's up against everybody
[1596.96 - 1603.20] coughing and sick
[1598.64 - 1604.96] darkness purposely creates all that
[1603.20 - 1606.72] to keep people down
[1604.96 - 1608.72] to break them down
[1606.72 - 1610.84] to torture them
[1608.72 - 1612.48] and then you need like you need
[1610.84 - 1614.40] light
[1612.48 - 1616.24] with technology right so you need
[1614.40 - 1617.52] companies that actually want to work for
[1616.24 - 1619.04] the light
[1617.52 - 1620.72] right you need companies that want to
[1619.04 - 1622.08] work for god
[1620.72 - 1623.52] companies that want to work for jesus
[1622.08 - 1625.76] christ companies that want to work for
[1623.52 - 1628.56] the light companies want to work for
[1625.76 - 1630.48] they want to work for you know
[1628.56 - 1631.68] the light of the universe right but the
[1630.48 - 1634.24] point is is
[1631.68 - 1636.00] that's how you battle darkness is you
[1634.24 - 1637.36] create things that darkness never
[1636.00 - 1640.24] expected
[1637.36 - 1642.00] or never saw coming and that's what the
[1640.24 - 1644.08] library so when i talk about when i talk
[1642.00 - 1645.76] to a friend about it
[1644.08 - 1647.04] i'll be like you will not see anything
[1645.76 - 1649.36] like this
[1647.04 - 1652.96] and this is to kind of upgrade for what
[1649.36 - 1652.96] the darkness does so
[1653.04 - 1656.88] to you know important things when you
[1654.56 - 1659.52] think about it
[1656.88 - 1662.48] really important
[1659.52 - 1666.60] let's make a little time water
[1662.48 - 1666.60] you could try that you guys
[1668.96 - 1672.96] honor to have you guys here i'm talking
[1670.88 - 1674.80] about building up your system protecting
[1672.96 - 1676.16] your system that's the vitamin c shock
[1674.80 - 1678.40] therapy right there i'm going to move it
[1676.16 - 1678.40] over
[1678.80 - 1682.96] okay and you can essentially do anything
[1681.20 - 1684.88] you can take ginger
[1682.96 - 1686.56] you can grate it you can chop it up you
[1684.88 - 1688.64] can throw it into some hot water you can
[1686.56 - 1690.48] make ginger water
[1688.64 - 1691.92] so and just so you know if energy has
[1690.48 - 1695.12] distributors around the world go to the
[1691.92 - 1697.28] website bimrgy.com visa victor i am as
[1695.12 - 1699.12] ergy vimorgy.com and look for the
[1697.28 - 1700.96] distributed distributor that's closest
[1699.12 - 1702.80] to you around the world if you're
[1700.96 - 1704.64] if you're from another area you know on
[1702.80 - 1706.08] the planet right it's for people asking
[1704.64 - 1707.76] about it
[1706.08 - 1709.68] all right so we talked about the olive
[1707.76 - 1712.16] leaf that's something
[1709.68 - 1714.80] that is really important right now the
[1712.16 - 1717.92] zinc shock therapy so that's two dropper
[1714.80 - 1721.04] fulls every three hours two days three
[1717.92 - 1722.40] days and check it out medical medium um
[1721.04 - 1724.16] information right there i got the
[1722.40 - 1726.72] licorice got the lemon balm i talked
[1724.16 - 1729.04] about b12 is a great one too
[1726.72 - 1732.88] because what happens is when when we're
[1729.04 - 1735.52] exposed to critters that knock us down
[1732.88 - 1737.12] and then we're just beaten down from it
[1735.52 - 1738.96] right
[1737.12 - 1740.72] you need something to support the
[1738.96 - 1742.72] central nervous system something to help
[1740.72 - 1745.52] the central nervous system reboot back
[1742.72 - 1749.20] up because that fatigue people get when
[1745.52 - 1751.76] they get hit by that storm
[1749.20 - 1754.88] they get that fatigue and it's like it's
[1751.76 - 1756.56] critical that that you get b12 into the
[1754.88 - 1759.36] central nervous system because the b12
[1756.56 - 1760.96] just gets knocked right out of people
[1759.36 - 1762.24] so when you're up against stuff and you
[1760.96 - 1764.16] start getting that
[1762.24 - 1766.64] and everything in it and all that with
[1764.16 - 1768.64] it your immune system
[1766.64 - 1770.32] it takes a beating but your nervous
[1768.64 - 1771.84] system takes a beating too your whole
[1770.32 - 1776.32] your whole system gets kind of beaten
[1771.84 - 1777.60] down dr phonemd good good to see you
[1776.32 - 1778.96] so there you go
[1777.60 - 1781.52] so we're talking about that that's a
[1778.96 - 1783.76] vitamin d3 right there
[1781.52 - 1785.36] so that's a really high quality d3 so
[1783.76 - 1786.72] what i'm gonna do is put some drops in
[1785.36 - 1788.32] the shot glass
[1786.72 - 1789.36] right here
[1788.32 - 1792.56] so

[1797.28 - 1800.32] there
[1798.32 - 1804.40] i know that everybody's vitamin d crazy
[1800.32 - 1806.40] but like d crazy d d d d d d d
[1804.40 - 1808.80] you know and everybody's always asking
[1806.40 - 1811.04] about d that's that's the one i use
[1808.80 - 1813.76] right there
[1811.04 - 1815.44] you'll notice that
[1813.76 - 1817.28] that is definitely
[1815.44 - 1821.32] a supreme product right
[1817.28 - 1821.32] so that's my shot glass
[1822.24 - 1826.56] so let's make some time water really

[1832.56 - 1836.64] reason because you just can't get one
[1834.80 - 1838.56] or you can't get a really good quality
[1836.64 - 1840.40] one so you're using a less quality one

[2044.24 - 2048.00] really want
[2046.56 - 2050.00] but there you go
[2048.00 - 2051.04] you got the time t and it's steeping
[2050.00 - 2053.04] right now
[2051.04 - 2056.08] you can steep it longer than 10 to 15
[2053.04 - 2058.72] minutes but you want the minimum 10
[2056.08 - 2061.28] 15 minutes is the minimum that's what
[2058.72 - 2063.04] you want so that's important so this is
[2061.28 - 2064.40] incredible for what we're up against
[2063.04 - 2065.68] right now today
[2064.40 - 2068.32] okay
[2065.68 - 2069.92] that's a great one right there
[2068.32 - 2071.36] so we got the time t we got the time
[2069.92 - 2073.28] water we talked about the vitamin c
[2071.36 - 2075.84] shock therapy we talked about the zinc
[2073.28 - 2078.08] shock therapy which is two dropper holes
[2075.84 - 2079.84] every three hours we'll talk about some
[2078.08 - 2081.36] wild blueberry juice
[2079.84 - 2083.84] are you guys doing any wild blueberry
[2081.36 - 2085.52] juice for your system right now keeping
[2083.84 - 2087.36] your system strong for this type of time
[2085.52 - 2089.68] of year
[2087.36 - 2093.12] those intense antioxidants all those
[2089.68 - 2095.28] intense strong antioxidants right
[2093.12 - 2097.84] this is a really
[2095.28 - 2099.68] important one too i do work with weimans
[2097.84 - 2102.40] though so i'm just going to give you let
[2099.68 - 2104.00] you know i work with weimans reason why
[2102.40 - 2106.16] i work with wyman's
[2104.00 - 2108.08] on this is because this is an entirely
[2106.16 - 2110.00] different thing all in its own that i
[2108.08 - 2113.12] don't want to disappear i don't want
[2110.00 - 2114.72] this to disappear someday they pick the
[2113.12 - 2118.40] wild blueberry
[2114.72 - 2121.44] out of the field the wild blueberry okay
[2118.40 - 2124.24] which cannot be killed nothing can kill
[2121.44 - 2126.56] the wild blueberry plant because of its
[2124.24 - 2128.40] strength so for thousands and thousands
[2126.56 - 2131.20] of years
[2128.40 - 2133.52] right it has adapted and it can handle
[2131.20 - 2135.52] fire and then grow back
[2133.52 - 2138.96] and you see what people don't realize is
[2135.52 - 2141.60] that when fires go through forests
[2138.96 - 2144.64] nothing grows back unless a bird or a
[2141.60 - 2148.00] squirrel goes on to the property onto
[2144.64 - 2150.24] the land and then poops a seed
[2148.00 - 2152.00] so when a when a when a
[2150.24 - 2153.76] bird is flying by
[2152.00 - 2156.16] and goes the bathroom
[2153.76 - 2158.00] and drops seeds down on that land that's
[2156.16 - 2159.68] the only time you can get things to
[2158.00 - 2162.08] start growing back when you've had
[2159.68 - 2164.08] wildfires because wildfires when they
[2162.08 - 2165.36] burn everything to the ground like
[2164.08 - 2167.60] really burn everything to the ground
[2165.36 - 2170.72] nothing will grow back
[2167.60 - 2173.68] so you have to have a squirrel bring a
[2170.72 - 2175.84] nut to plant a new tree right well the
[2173.68 - 2177.92] wild blueberry plant
[2175.84 - 2180.24] is the only plant on the planet where
[2177.92 - 2182.88] you can wipe you can burn it to the
[2180.24 - 2184.88] ground i'm talking we're talking flame
[2182.88 - 2186.88] like no one's ever seen
[2184.88 - 2188.88] like just burn it to the ground a
[2186.88 - 2190.56] wildfire anything like that right you
[2188.88 - 2193.76] can torch it to the ground and it'll
[2190.56 - 2194.80] grow back up it'll grow back up fast
[2193.76 - 2197.36] so
[2194.80 - 2199.84] its roots are that strong and it just
[2197.36 - 2201.20] doesn't get killed off and and so that's
[2199.84 - 2203.12] one reason why just you know wild
[2201.20 - 2204.48] blueberry is just an amazing species all
[2203.12 - 2207.12] on its own
[2204.48 - 2208.16] but i can't like i can't say enough
[2207.12 - 2209.76] about
[2208.16 - 2211.28] like wild blueberry juice so i work with
[2209.76 - 2212.32] wyman's
[2211.28 - 2215.04] because
[2212.32 - 2217.84] for them to pick the wild blueberry
[2215.04 - 2219.76] and press it
[2217.84 - 2220.80] so it's not like when you go to the
[2219.76 - 2222.88] store
[2220.80 - 2225.04] and you see that hpp stuff or whatever
[2222.88 - 2226.64] that's different that hpp stuff that's
[2225.04 - 2229.52] not like this is actually they take the
[2226.64 - 2231.68] wild blueberry and they press
[2229.52 - 2233.20] those wild blueberries and you get
[2231.68 - 2236.32] something that's like
[2233.20 - 2238.40] this is this supersedes wine
[2236.32 - 2239.68] supersedes wine all together right so i
[2238.40 - 2241.84] don't know if you guys are doing your
[2239.68 - 2243.68] shot glasses of this but the antioch
[2241.84 - 2245.44] anthocyanin levels are something that no
[2243.68 - 2249.04] one's ever you can't even touch that
[2245.44 - 2249.04] with wild blueberry it's incredible
[2249.52 - 2252.64] that's a tonic right
[2253.84 - 2259.84] lauren brown
[2255.60 - 2260.64] i thought you said no lemon in hot water
[2259.84 - 2263.36] so
[2260.64 - 2264.64] lemon for tea is great can do it anytime
[2263.36 - 2268.08] you want
[2264.64 - 2268.84] it's not going to flush your liver
[2268.08 - 2271.60] or
[2268.84 - 2274.48] flush your body
[2271.60 - 2275.36] when it's used for tea and hot water
[2274.48 - 2276.64] okay
[2275.36 - 2279.76] but lemon
[2276.64 - 2282.08] in 32 ounces of water or 16 ounces of
[2279.76 - 2283.76] water or even 8 ounces of water just
[2282.08 - 2286.08] even lemon
[2283.76 - 2289.92] in water that's not hot
[2286.08 - 2291.76] will then stay active and flush poisons
[2289.92 - 2293.36] and toxins out of your liver and out of
[2291.76 - 2295.60] your body
[2293.36 - 2296.84] see so if you want to do the lemon water
[2295.60 - 2299.04] to
[2296.84 - 2300.80] flush poisons and toxins out of the
[2299.04 - 2303.76] liver in the body then you have to make
[2300.80 - 2305.92] sure it's not in hot hot water
[2303.76 - 2307.12] or hot water you got to make sure it's
[2305.92 - 2309.04] in
[2307.12 - 2311.60] regular water like room temperature
[2309.04 - 2314.24] water or cold water is fine or just
[2311.60 - 2316.24] lukewarm water or something but you
[2314.24 - 2318.00] don't want want it in hot water when you
[2316.24 - 2321.12] put it in tea it's different so you can
[2318.00 - 2322.64] do it medicinally in tea
[2321.12 - 2324.96] and you get other
[2322.64 - 2326.56] medicine out of your lemon when you have
[2324.96 - 2328.40] it in hot water but that's not the same
[2326.56 - 2330.40] thing you can't flush your liver then
[2328.40 - 2332.64] you want to flush your liver you have to
[2330.40 - 2335.60] have the 32 ounces of lemon water with
[2332.64 - 2338.64] the lemon juice not in hot water
[2335.60 - 2339.92] medical medium information
[2338.64 - 2343.20] where do you buy the wild blueberry
[2339.92 - 2344.20] juice shop s-h-o-p
[2343.20 - 2346.32] dot
[2344.20 - 2349.32] weimanns.com so wyman's is
[2346.32 - 2349.32] w-y-m-a-n-s-shop.wymans.com
[2352.32 - 2355.68] so that's the blueberry juice right
[2354.40 - 2358.32] so i just took a shot of it i'm going to
[2355.68 - 2360.56] take another shot of it
[2358.32 - 2362.80] i've been doing so much today that i
[2360.56 - 2365.04] really haven't
[2362.80 - 2367.28] had much too much of anything i had some
[2365.04 - 2369.52] celery juice this morning though
[2367.28 - 2372.48] tammy but doesn't lemon warm up when you
[2369.52 - 2372.48] put it in your body
[2372.64 - 2377.12] well the temperature that comes out of
[2374.64 - 2377.12] the kettle
[2378.16 - 2382.96] is really hot
[2380.00 - 2385.20] and if your blood was that hot
[2382.96 - 2387.68] you wouldn't be here right now so you
[2385.20 - 2389.68] can't have your blood
[2387.68 - 2391.60] the temperature of your body
[2389.68 - 2393.60] right
[2391.60 - 2395.36] cannot
[2393.60 - 2396.88] cannot be as hot
[2395.36 - 2398.40] as the water
[2396.88 - 2400.24] in the kettle
[2398.40 - 2401.40] the water in the kettle
[2400.24 - 2407.52] is
[2401.40 - 2411.44] 120 30 40 60 180 degrees
[2407.52 - 2413.92] and that's what that is right
[2411.44 - 2416.00] so you got to be really careful right if
[2413.92 - 2417.68] you're meaning in the sense
[2416.00 - 2420.56] heather says it's the cognitive
[2417.68 - 2422.72] dissonance anthony once you say one word
[2420.56 - 2425.72] some someone will get triggered and go
[2422.72 - 2425.72] blank
[2426.08 - 2430.80] well
[2428.00 - 2432.88] look it's when it comes down when
[2430.80 - 2434.88] when it comes down to it though so this
[2432.88 - 2437.04] is important to know
[2434.88 - 2438.96] is that yeah i mean it's true i mean
[2437.04 - 2440.40] yeah i totally understand when it comes
[2438.96 - 2442.76] down to it with the hot water in the
[2440.40 - 2444.56] body and stuff your temperature is
[2442.76 - 2447.28] 98.5
[2444.56 - 2450.00] 97.4
[2447.28 - 2452.60] 97.8
[2450.00 - 2454.40] 98.6
[2452.60 - 2456.16] 98.7
[2454.40 - 2457.92] so everybody's body temps run at
[2456.16 - 2460.32] different temperatures right
[2457.92 - 2462.00] a lot of people run like i run a really
[2460.32 - 2464.00] low body temp
[2462.00 - 2466.24] and a lot of people run a higher body
[2464.00 - 2468.56] temp they'll be like 98.6
[2466.24 - 2471.44] they'll be like 98.7
[2468.56 - 2474.16] right they'll run a higher body temp
[2471.44 - 2477.44] but that's that can't hurt
[2474.16 - 2480.00] any it can't hurt lemon going in you
[2477.44 - 2481.44] because that's not a 130
[2480.00 - 2483.52] degrees
[2481.44 - 2486.56] 120 degrees
[2483.52 - 2488.72] or if you here's the problem if you cook
[2486.56 - 2493.04] your lemon so say your water comes out
[2488.72 - 2494.64] of that kettle at a buck 40
[2493.04 - 2496.32] and you put your lemon in there you just
[2494.64 - 2498.48] killed your lemon juice
[2496.32 - 2499.84] and then the water cools down and you
[2498.48 - 2502.64] think well now the water's cool enough
[2499.84 - 2504.32] for me to drink no the lemon won't flush
[2502.64 - 2508.96] because it's been killed off in there
[2504.32 - 2510.80] with the high temperature it had so
[2508.96 - 2512.64] but you want to flush out your liver you
[2510.80 - 2515.28] want to flush out your blood you want to
[2512.64 - 2516.80] flush everything out you need that lemon
[2515.28 - 2519.52] water being like it is and that's
[2516.80 - 2521.20] another system builder right there
[2519.52 - 2522.72] the reason why you see oranges here and
[2521.20 - 2524.56] you see lemons in here because we're
[2522.72 - 2526.80] talking about system builders so what i
[2524.56 - 2530.16] like doing is making some fresh squeezed
[2526.80 - 2531.84] orange juice that's what i like to do
[2530.16 - 2535.52] lemon and tea
[2531.84 - 2537.76] some abilities of the lemon survive
[2535.52 - 2540.96] but not the flushing
[2537.76 - 2542.72] and poison remover ability
[2540.96 - 2544.24] so the flushing and poison remover
[2542.72 - 2546.24] ability right
[2544.24 - 2548.48] inside your liver that's not going to
[2546.24 - 2549.60] make it if your lemon juice gets hot
[2548.48 - 2551.04] that's not going to float you're not
[2549.60 - 2552.40] going to flush out the intestinal tract
[2551.04 - 2554.16] or the liver
[2552.40 - 2557.28] it can't happen so you're not going to
[2554.16 - 2559.76] be able to do that liver flush
[2557.28 - 2562.40] that intestinal tract flush poisons and
[2559.76 - 2563.44] toxins your kidney flush
[2562.40 - 2565.84] you're not going to be able to do your
[2563.44 - 2568.32] kidney flush if the lemon get got too
[2565.84 - 2570.48] hot so if your lemon is in your tea
[2568.32 - 2572.24] you can't do your kidney flush
[2570.48 - 2573.20] and your liver flush and your intestinal
[2572.24 - 2576.64] flush
[2573.20 - 2579.20] but there's going to be still medicinal
[2576.64 - 2580.64] chemical compounds in there that are
[2579.20 - 2582.16] going to help you when you're doing it
[2580.64 - 2584.80] in your tea
[2582.16 - 2588.48] that's the difference
[2584.80 - 2588.48] so it's important to know
[2588.96 - 2592.08] so let's go let's keep on moving on a
[2590.56 - 2594.56] couple more things let's cut some aloe
[2592.08 - 2595.76] too what i do is aloe every day during
[2594.56 - 2598.32] this
[2595.76 - 2602.16] time of year especially
[2598.32 - 2602.16] so medical medium information
[2602.40 - 2608.96] there's some aloe right
[2604.84 - 2610.80] there right it talks about aloe a lot
[2608.96 - 2613.12] that's a great system builder right
[2610.80 - 2615.04] there for what's happening for people
[2613.12 - 2618.56] so what i do is i cut this just like
[2615.04 - 2620.80] that i didn't cut all the way through
[2618.56 - 2622.24] i cut that part so i ran the knife like
[2620.80 - 2624.88] this
[2622.24 - 2624.88] just like this
[2625.52 - 2629.36] and then you can open it like that
[2629.60 - 2632.72] now you can do it any way you want you
[2631.20 - 2634.80] can take a spoon in there you can do it
[2632.72 - 2637.44] that way i take the knife
[2634.80 - 2640.32] and i kind of fillet
[2637.44 - 2642.96] that top off of there right
[2640.32 - 2644.16] there we go i'm going to open it up
[2642.96 - 2646.64] you guys see that you guys see that on
[2644.16 - 2646.64] telegram
[2646.96 - 2653.60] okay and then i take the knife
[2651.84 - 2655.52] and i fillet
[2653.60 - 2657.60] that part out right there
[2655.52 - 2659.92] and you can take this
[2657.60 - 2659.92] now
[2660.56 - 2666.72] this is incredible right now
[2663.20 - 2668.72] as far as for a protection method
[2666.72 - 2671.20] something that should be added in you
[2668.72 - 2673.92] might be somebody that only
[2671.20 - 2675.44] has you know access to aloe
[2673.92 - 2678.32] like this fresh outlook but you don't
[2675.44 - 2680.64] have access to time or access to an
[2678.32 - 2683.36] orange or access to lemons right now or
[2680.64 - 2684.48] access to these incredible supplements
[2683.36 - 2686.64] and so
[2684.48 - 2688.80] eating it like that is great really
[2686.64 - 2691.04] incredible for you
[2688.80 - 2692.96] so that's another option so we talked
[2691.04 - 2693.76] about the micro c that's a big one right
[2692.96 - 2695.44] there
[2693.76 - 2697.92] olive leaf that's incredible for now
[2695.44 - 2699.68] what people are going through right
[2697.92 - 2701.76] you got the d3 for the people that love
[2699.68 - 2703.36] the d3 and want the d3 got the lemon
[2701.76 - 2705.36] balm that's the tender one i talked
[2703.36 - 2707.76] about you got the zing shark therapy you
[2705.36 - 2710.24] got the cat's claw
[2707.76 - 2712.16] and then goldenseal is a big one right
[2710.24 - 2714.32] now i'm just looking for the golden seal
[2712.16 - 2715.84] like for some reason can't find it
[2714.32 - 2718.48] but goldenseal
[2715.84 - 2720.72] that's a big deal
[2718.48 - 2720.72] and
