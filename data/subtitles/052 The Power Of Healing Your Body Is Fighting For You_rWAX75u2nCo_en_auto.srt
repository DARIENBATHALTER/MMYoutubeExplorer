your body loves you

80
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:39,720
unconditionally your body will never

81
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:43,639
turn against you your body is working

82
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:48,800
hard for you every day it's fighting for

83
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:53,000
you not fighting against you you can

your organs and

to be sick you don't have a fear of

92
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:25,400
healing you're not lazy you're not

93
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:28,360
trying to trick anyone you're not trying

94
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:31,120
to trick everyone you're not pretending

95
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:33,759
to be sick you're not doing this on

96
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:37,759
purpose and you're not doing it to try

97
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:40,720
to get attention you're not a weak

98
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:44,120
person you're the opposite you're the

99
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:47,600
opposite of a weak person you are truly

100
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:50,960
a strong person you have a strong light

101
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:54,520
inside of you one that can never be

102
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:58,160
taken away from you you Harbor a life

103
00:05:54,520 --> 00:06:00,960
force you have a soul it is more

104
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:03,680
powerful than you know know and no one

105
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,039
can ever take that power away from you

106
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,599
not even

107
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:10,240
sickness there weren't answers out there

108
00:06:07,599 --> 00:06:13,400
for chronic illness all these decades

109
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:16,199
before and because there weren't any

110
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:19,759
answers one of the cornerstones people

111
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:22,960
were told was people had a fear of

112
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:25,400
healing they were sick because they did

113
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:29,720
not want to heal because they were

114
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:33,440
afraid let's face it there is no one I

115
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:36,720
repeat no one who is sick physically

116
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:39,520
emotionally or mentally that doesn't

117
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,840
heal because they are afraid to get

118
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:44,599
better that they're scared to

119
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:48,240
heal they could be afraid of something

120
00:06:44,599 --> 00:06:52,560
else they could be nervous or scared

121
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:55,960
about the path the journey what it may

122
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:58,919
entail and what it may be about the

123
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:01,479
process or how they may be feeling

124
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:04,160
through the time they are healing but

125
00:07:01,479 --> 00:07:07,599
there is no world where they are afraid

126
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:10,120
to heal and that's why they are sick or

127
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:13,960
chronically ill because they're scared

128
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:17,199
there's no place for that people want to

129
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:20,240
heal they want to feel good or at least

130
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:23,879
just good enough any equality of life is

131
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:26,680
sacred and people know this how many

132
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:30,680
people who got sick were told that they

133
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:33,240
were lazy that their fatigue wasn't real

134
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:36,479
they were just struggling with a lack of

135
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:38,960
motivation they had no passion for life

136
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:40,080
their fatigue and tiredness was a lack

137
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:44,319
of

138
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:47,680
Interest a lack of caring and maybe just

139
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:50,720
depression Meanwhile your legs they felt

140
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:55,039
like sandbags and your arms they felt

141
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:57,879
like lead and your body felt so heavy

142
00:07:55,039 --> 00:08:01,560
even lifeless like gravity was pulling

143
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:04,720
you down it was not just you being lazy

144
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:09,240
and just plain tired or

145
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:12,520
unmotivated your fatigue was real and is

146
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:15,199
real and you are a warrior to push

147
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:19,599
through each and every day no one

148
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:22,039
realizes that because you are so strong

149
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:25,319
they just don't realize it and they take

150
00:08:22,039 --> 00:08:27,479
for granted what you're going through

151
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:31,759
and there are real reasons why you are

152
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:34,440
so sick you're not a weak person instead

153
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:37,519
you are a strong person no matter what

154
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:40,599
you're ailing with when we get sick here

155
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:44,959
on planet Earth we default to thinking

156
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:48,720
we are a bad person it can automatically

157
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:51,480
happen because we feel we aren't as

158
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:55,240
useful sometimes many people feel they

159
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:58,240
are in the way they lost their purpose

160
00:08:55,240 --> 00:09:01,680
we are a burden and something is wrong

161
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:05,399
with our body so we start believing that

162
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:08,560
we are a bad person but this is so far

163
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:12,519
from the truth just because we get sick

164
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:15,600
isn't any reason to believe that you or

165
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:18,640
anyone are a bad

166
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:21,640
person when people get sick they've

167
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:25,440
heard this before at some point on their

168
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:27,800
Journey your body has turned against you

169
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:31,480
that's the words that have rolled off of

170
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:34,680
many tongues an answer that brings

171
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:38,720
people no relief it brings people into a

172
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:41,800
darker Place how is it ever possible to

173
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:45,360
really heal believing that your body has

174
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:49,040
betrayed you and won't let you heal and

175
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:51,959
instead is making the opposite happen

176
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:54,640
your body is making you sick the

177
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:57,680
powerful truth is your body will never

178
00:09:54,640 --> 00:10:00,839
turn against you instead it's working

179
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:03,640
for you every day and it wants to

180
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:05,880
thrive maybe you know somebody maybe

181
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:09,040
you've been through it yourself people

182
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:12,360
who care for others that are really sick

183
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:15,640
can understand pain and suffering too

184
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:18,560
they see it and they can realize it they

185
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:21,240
watch the person suffer and struggle

186
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:24,200
