2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:05,120
question that comes up all the time just

3

because you have weak adrenals doesn't

4
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,360

5
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:11,040
sodium levels but if you're hitting your

6
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:12,639
body with the quick hit the wrong sodium

7
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,080
is not going to help your adrenals you

8
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:17,320

9
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:19,320

10
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:21,039

13
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:28,880
adrenals you can dry them up like little

14
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,439
prunes if you overs salt and then it

15
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,160
gets worse need more salt for my

16
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:33,719
adrenals but your adrenals are being

17
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,480
pickled and they're shriveling up and

18
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:38,440
dying more salt for my adrenals ma'am

00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,480
your adrenals aren't doing good so you

20
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:42,440
need more salt and you're addicted to

00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,160

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:49,640
