[0.16 - 5.80] it out there people catch a bug they get
[3.04 - 8.04] sick they're coughing their lungs out
[5.80 - 11.48] they're really sick they got fevers
[8.04 - 12.96] going up and down they start to recover
[11.48 - 15.32] they go to a doctor they get on an
[12.96 - 19.28] antibiotic whatever it is they start to
[15.32 - 20.52] recover and then they stay sick they
[19.28 - 22.80] think they're going to recover and
[20.52 - 25.16] bounce back completely but they're
[22.80 - 27.12] dragging or two weeks later they're
[25.16 - 28.64] doing a little better and then it hits
[27.12 - 30.72] them and they're dragging and they're
[28.64 - 32.44] going down
[30.72 - 34.40] and what's happening out there people
[32.44 - 37.08] are getting sick and then they're
[34.40 - 38.92] falling into this chronically ill
[37.08 - 40.56] trigger and now they're getting all
[38.92 - 43.32] these different things like brain fog
[40.56 - 46.28] and weird tingles and numbness on their
[43.32 - 48.36] body and aches and pains and fatigue and
[46.28 - 50.00] brain fog again and they just don't feel
[48.36 - 52.60] themselves and now they're triggered
[50.00 - 54.12] into something entirely different
[52.60 - 56.52] because of the bugs going around right
[54.12 - 58.92] now right now in New England in the
[56.52 - 61.36] United States there's a stomach flu
[58.92 - 63.68] neuro virus and and it's pounding the
[61.36 - 66.04] crap out of people right now up there
[63.68 - 69.60] and it's heading through through the
[66.04 - 73.00] United States and around the world and
[69.60 - 74.80] it's giving people like insane diarrhea
[73.00 - 76.96] and gut disturbances and we're going to
[74.80 - 78.44] cover that a little bit cuz I want to
[76.96 - 81.12] talk about that like what does it do in
[78.44 - 83.48] the gut like what happens there's people
[81.12 - 86.32] all about you know microbiome what
[83.48 - 88.48] happens if you get the neuro virus and
[86.32 - 90.24] you got the stomach flu and it's ripping
[88.48 - 92.08] through your guts and you're sitting
[90.24 - 94.84] there and you're just diarrhea diarrhea
[92.08 - 96.84] vomiting too and diarrhea diarrhea and
[94.84 - 98.76] then what like what happened how's your
[96.84 - 101.32] microbiome then is it all fixed is it
[98.76 - 102.84] all great what's it like nobody really
[101.32 - 104.96] talks about that they don't talk about
[102.84 - 107.24] what happens when boom you get that
[104.96 - 109.76] neuro virus and you got the stomach flu
[107.24 - 111.44] and then is your microbiome is is that
[109.76 - 113.04] going to get back to normal wasn't even
[111.44 - 115.68] normal to begin with and is it going to
[113.04 - 117.44] get back to normal eventually or is it
[115.68 - 119.08] going to be out of balance now for next
[117.44 - 120.84] another two years until you get another
[119.08 - 121.92] stomach flu
[120.84 - 123.56] so I'm talking about a bunch of
[121.92 - 125.72] different things okay there a lot of

[187.08 - 191.88] have had discolorations with the tongue
[188.88 - 193.28] so it's good information very important
[191.88 - 195.24] but I'm here to talk about our immune
[193.28 - 197.00] system and how it's getting pretty beat
[195.24 - 198.24] up these days with what people are going
[197.00 - 199.76] through do you know anybody that's
[198.24 - 201.20] coughing do you know anybody that's got
[199.76 - 203.36] a sore throat and a fever do you know
[201.20 - 204.96] anybody who's been hit with anything
[203.36 - 207.36] that's going on because people have been
[204.96 - 209.84] getting hit it's like a surgence of it
[207.36 - 211.92] insurgence of it happening right now
[209.84 - 213.84] this is like one of those hot spots
[211.92 - 216.04] we're in where it's just really starting
[213.84 - 217.76] to pick up pace I hear it all the time
[216.04 - 220.92] people are sick for a month with it
[217.76 - 225.80] coughing out their lungs the whole bit
[220.92 - 230.08] but then to add insult to injury there
[225.80 - 234.60] is a neov virus stomach flu hyper catchy
[230.08 - 236.76] hyper catchy that's actually steaming
[234.60 - 238.92] streaming right out of New England right
[236.76 - 241.84] now and it's going to be cutting across
[238.92 - 243.80] the country and and you know overseas
[241.84 - 246.28] and everywhere else and that one really
[243.80 - 247.80] sucks really really sucks so what I'm
[246.28 - 250.12] doing right now is the reason why I'm
[247.80 - 253.12] even here is because I'm saying are you
[250.12 - 254.68] taking care of your immune system are
[253.12 - 256.96] you taking care of your immune system
[254.68 - 260.04] right so I have my family on this right
[256.96 - 262.68] here just a safeguard I need a safeguard
[260.04 - 265.12] my family and my closest friends you
[262.68 - 268.48] know safeguarding them too and all that
[265.12 - 270.64] so that's the total immune blend do you
[268.48 - 271.96] have it what's crazy out there is what
[270.64 - 273.28] I'm seeing right now is all these
[271.96 - 274.56] different supplements are coming out
[273.28 - 275.92] it's like crazy right and they're
[274.56 - 277.68] claiming all this stuff and claiming all
[275.92 - 279.76] this stuff but they don't work they
[277.68 - 281.96] don't work and you look what's in them
[279.76 - 283.96] it's like yeah all poor quality crap all
[281.96 - 286.16] garbage whatever you name it and they
[283.96 - 288.08] just don't work it's so sad that's what
[286.16 - 290.52] I'm seeing out there you guys know I
[288.08 - 293.92] endorse these guys this is vmer g v is
[290.52 - 295.64] in Victor i m is in Mary E RG y I'll get
[293.92 - 299.16] a close-up too on this right here this
[295.64 - 301.84] is the total immune I'm living off of it
[299.16 - 303.56] to protect myself cuz I can't get sick
[301.84 - 304.68] right now with any kind of cold or
[303.56 - 307.16] anything like
[304.68 - 308.80] flu anything like that I use the term
[307.16 - 312.20] cold but you know how there's no colds
[308.80 - 313.48] anyway but is this back in stock it's
[312.20 - 315.16] back in stock so I give you a little
[313.48 - 316.40] closeup on this before I move on because
[315.16 - 317.60] we're going to talk about some stuff in
[316.40 - 319.80] the immune system which is really
[317.60 - 322.36] important so that's total immune blend
[319.80 - 325.24] right there there it is that's the
[322.36 - 328.60] vimergy I don't know if you guys see it
[325.24 - 330.08] there it is very important critical
[328.60 - 333.00] critical
[330.08 - 335.32] um resource right there it's got the
[333.00 - 338.08] time it's got the Mullen it's back in
[335.32 - 340.40] stock it's sold out like this when it
[338.08 - 341.96] came out so a lot of people armed
[340.40 - 345.52] themselves and armed their immune
[341.96 - 347.16] systems for what was coming but I want
[345.52 - 349.84] to talk about even more than that I want
[347.16 - 352.64] to go into like what people are dealing
[349.84 - 355.24] with post getting sick and what they're
[352.64 - 357.24] dealing with pre getting sick because
[355.24 - 359.68] everybody has immune system problems and
[357.24 - 361.80] that's that's a big thing right there on
[359.68 - 364.32] its own if you got a
[361.80 - 366.56] symptom if you got any kind of symptom
[364.32 - 369.44] if you got any kind of
[366.56 - 371.00] condition if you've been diagnosed with
[369.44 - 374.76] a condition if you're struggling with
[371.00 - 377.32] any kind of symptom immune system right
[374.76 - 379.56] there anything people who are dealing
[377.32 - 380.92] with cancer immune systems broke down
[379.56 - 383.92] people are dealing with all kinds of
[380.92 - 387.76] different things like fibro and ra and
[383.92 - 389.12] lime and anything immune system people
[387.76 - 391.04] that're dealing with all kinds of aches
[389.12 - 393.40] and pain pain and Tinkles and numbness
[391.04 - 396.44] and vertigo and ringing in the ears and
[393.40 - 400.64] dizziness and balance issues immune
[396.44 - 402.68] system we have injured depleted
[400.64 - 405.32] diminished immune systems and that's
[402.68 - 406.84] what people live with every single day
[405.32 - 408.60] if you know somebody and they're getting
[406.84 - 409.80] things and they're getting symptoms and
[408.60 - 412.32] they're
[409.80 - 415.56] struggling yeah it's their immune system
[412.32 - 417.44] it's struggling that's the whole point
[415.56 - 419.68] it can't handle exposures it can't
[417.44 - 421.60] handle the toxic heavy metal exposures
[419.68 - 423.24] and then the herbicide and the fungicide
[421.60 - 426.20] exposures and the
[423.24 - 428.20] fragrances and the caffeine addiction it
[426.20 - 430.84] can't handle the immune system can't
[428.20 - 433.20] handle that so many people are drowning
[430.84 - 435.60] themselves with coffee and espresso
[433.20 - 437.40] drinks and they're just beating the crap
[435.60 - 440.72] out of their immune system so immune
[437.40 - 443.72] system is just under attack all the time
[440.72 - 446.64] and So eventually what that leads us to
[443.72 - 449.44] is a sickness no matter
[446.64 - 451.68] what everyone is going to get a sick
[449.44 - 453.00] symptom no matter what you see somebody
[451.68 - 454.36] out there right now they're on social
[453.00 - 456.00] like yeah I'm doing this I'm doing that
[454.36 - 458.20] I'm Into Fitness I'm into this you're
[456.00 - 460.00] going to have a symptom you're going to
[458.20 - 461.80] have a symptom it's going to come later
[460.00 - 463.92] maybe but you're going to be pushed over
[461.80 - 465.48] the edge too many exposures your immune
[463.92 - 467.20] system is going to finally kick down and
[465.48 - 470.44] you're going to be in the immune system
[467.20 - 472.36] pit just like everybody else so keeping
[470.44 - 475.04] our immune system strong is critical
[472.36 - 477.68] having immune system power is
[475.04 - 478.80] critical having it strong and you'll
[477.68 - 481.64] hear things out there like you don't
[478.80 - 484.96] want your imun system too strong oh you
[481.64 - 487.92] don't really like okay whose immune
[484.96 - 490.88] system is too strong somebody tell me
[487.92 - 493.24] whose immune system is so strong you
[490.88 - 494.88] know I mean even like the best
[493.24 - 496.16] influencers out there talking about
[494.88 - 497.64] health and everything they're dealing
[496.16 - 500.16] with immune system problems that's how
[497.64 - 502.96] they got into it anyway they got into
[500.16 - 504.20] the health industry in general because
[502.96 - 506.04] they got problems and they're seeing
[504.20 - 508.08] their naturopath and their herbalist and
[506.04 - 510.64] their acupuncturist and their MD and
[508.08 - 512.80] their do and they're seeing everybody
[510.64 - 514.28] because they got all these problems
[512.80 - 515.76] because everybody's immune system is
[514.28 - 517.60] challenged that's the day and age we're
[515.76 - 519.52] in we're in the age of the quickening
[517.60 - 521.32] right here this is the quickening where
[519.52 - 523.80] [ __ ] just speeds up and speeds up and
[521.32 - 526.08] speeds up stuff is happening real fast
[523.80 - 528.36] out there and sickness and disease is
[526.08 - 531.24] climbing at an all-time high and it's
[528.36 - 533.72] staying climbing and climbing and
[531.24 - 537.92] climbing
[533.72 - 540.68] 2030 so many people are going to be sick
[537.92 - 542.36] 2035 it's going to be unbelievable on
[540.68 - 544.60] how many people are going to be sick
[542.36 - 546.20] everybody's going to be sick and
[544.60 - 548.00] everybody's going to be on social
[546.20 - 550.56] talking about their
[548.00 - 553.28] sicknesses that's what's going to happen
[550.56 - 556.28] it's going to dominate social
[553.28 - 558.36] entirely to a point where all articles
[556.28 - 560.32] out there all the media is going to be
[558.36 - 562.48] talking about sickness everybody's going
[560.32 - 566.36] to be talking about sickness stories
[562.48 - 568.72] this is just what it's going to be by
[566.36 - 569.92] 2030 nothing but sickness sickness
[568.72 - 571.96] sickness
[569.92 - 573.56] everywhere and that's the world we live
[571.96 - 575.44] in that's the world we're going to be
[573.56 - 576.96] living in and that's how crazy it really
[575.44 - 579.04] is when you really think about it right
[576.96 - 580.48] I mean did you ever expect that did you
[579.04 - 583.72] ever expect
[580.48 - 585.04] that yeah you're not alone so let's talk
[583.72 - 587.92] about the immune system a little bit and
[585.04 - 592.80] why it's so important to support it not
[587.92 - 596.04] just support it rebuild it rebuild it
[592.80 - 598.16] critical really is writing for truth on
[596.04 - 602.24] IG says do you take the total immune
[598.16 - 605.72] blend every day even when not sick I do
[602.24 - 609.00] I take it every single day even when not
[605.72 - 611.36] sick I take it every day okay but you
[609.00 - 613.36] can take it every day right do what your
[611.36 - 616.32] doctor wants to do but I tell my family
[613.36 - 618.88] you can take it every day but you can
[616.32 - 621.00] take a smaller dosage if you're not sick
[618.88 - 622.76] every single day then when you get sick
[621.00 - 624.96] or you're struggling with something you
[622.76 - 627.00] can increase the the dosage to what your
[624.96 - 629.60] whatever doctor believes or however
[627.00 - 633.64] what's in it a
[629.60 - 636.68] blend of thyme and Mullen and a little
[633.64 - 639.40] touch of zinc it's this perfect
[636.68 - 641.96] combination right here and what people
[639.40 - 644.92] don't realize it's the quality of the
[641.96 - 647.84] time on top of it it's the quality of
[644.92 - 650.76] the Mullen that you don't get in other
[647.84 - 652.60] places it doesn't happen it just doesn't
[650.76 - 655.68] I know I know the quality I know what
[652.60 - 658.36] they do I know how they do it and it's
[655.68 - 661.16] unbelievable it's about making sure that
[658.36 - 663.20] alcohol wasn't used that alcohol is not
[661.16 - 665.44] involved at any level making sure all
[663.20 - 669.24] these different things matter that this
[665.44 - 671.28] is really clean but the real thing not
[669.24 - 672.44] everybody saying good quality this is
[671.28 - 673.32] good quality everybody's allowed to say
[672.44 - 674.60] that did you know that you're allowed to
[673.32 - 676.68] say everything's good quality did you
[674.60 - 678.48] know that anybody who just opens up a
[676.68 - 679.96] door hangs a shingle and sells something
[678.48 - 683.12] they're allowed to say our quality is
[679.96 - 685.68] great nothing beats our quality there is
[683.12 - 689.20] a difference huge difference that's
[685.68 - 691.76] important to know it really is an IG
[689.20 - 696.08] Roxy says where can I buy it that's
[691.76 - 699.44] vimergy V is in Victor i m is in Mary E
[696.08 - 703.08] RG y vimergy.com
[699.44 - 706.64] link check out the link in the uh
[703.08 - 709.72] description so yeah Details
[706.64 - 712.16] Matter Details Matter I agree I see that
[709.72 - 713.64] right there okay so let's go into it a
[712.16 - 718.32] little
[713.64 - 720.40] bit all right couple of things to know
[718.32 - 723.04] one is
[720.40 - 726.88] why are immune systems so chopped up why
[723.04 - 729.16] are they so beat up and that's something
[726.88 - 731.08] that nobody really talks about they're
[729.16 - 733.76] just like this is immune supportive
[731.08 - 736.96] immune supportive everybody's immune
[733.76 - 739.24] system is just beaten to a pul basically
[736.96 - 740.80] and that's why everybody's so sick it's
[739.24 - 742.92] struggling immune system you got to
[740.80 - 745.92] remember that if there's anything
[742.92 - 750.44] someone's dealing with instantly the
[745.92 - 752.76] immune system is under siege Under Siege
[750.44 - 754.88] if someone's got panic attacks and they
[752.76 - 756.88] got the Titan chest and they got that
[754.88 - 758.56] Vagas nerve I talk about that Vagas
[756.88 - 760.28] nerves the
[758.56 - 762.12] inflammation and they're dealing with
[760.28 - 765.40] all kinds of anxiety and panic and all
[762.12 - 767.20] these other things immune system
[765.40 - 769.84] everything is like that thyroid
[767.20 - 772.48] condition at all thyroid anybody
[769.84 - 776.08] hypothyroid hyperthyroid any kind of
[772.48 - 779.48] thyroid problems at all anything
[776.08 - 783.68] Graves whatever it is nodul in the
[779.48 - 786.16] thyroid whatever it is immune system was
[783.68 - 788.68] challenged the thyroids immune system
[786.16 - 790.92] was challenged the liver's immune system
[788.68 - 793.12] was challenged and then weakened and
[790.92 - 795.04] then kicked down a notch so people walk
[793.12 - 797.56] around with weak immune systems that's
[795.04 - 800.76] what they do all day long and then the
[797.56 - 803.20] thyroid disorders creep up and then the
[800.76 - 805.28] panic and the aches and pains creep up
[803.20 - 806.88] and then the vertigo and the tentis and
[805.28 - 809.48] the tingles and numbness and the body
[806.88 - 813.00] aches and pains and the trigal neur Alia
[809.48 - 814.76] all creep up because their immune system
[813.00 - 817.72] is suffering their immune system is
[814.76 - 820.56] struggling so very important to know so
[817.72 - 823.24] let's talk about like stomach flu I want
[820.56 - 827.12] to go into that a little bit stomach
[823.24 - 828.60] flu okay so the reason why I would take
[827.12 - 830.12] like something every single day or I
[828.60 - 832.56] tell family to take something every
[830.12 - 835.08] single day like I tell my family take a
[832.56 - 838.08] little bit of this take little bit of
[835.08 - 839.92] the propolis every single day right
[838.08 - 841.88] little bit of the golden seal every
[839.92 - 843.68] single day this is what I tell my family
[841.88 - 846.12] to do all the time and a little bit of
[843.68 - 847.60] B12 and I want to talk about why B12 is
[846.12 - 851.60] critical cuz when we catch something
[847.60 - 853.52] like the neuro virus or white lung yeah
[851.60 - 854.96] which is really hurting a lot of people
[853.52 - 856.40] I mean they get scar tissue in the lung
[854.96 - 859.52] that lasts
[856.40 - 862.36] forever I mean that's just unfair like
[859.52 - 864.88] why do they put bugs out there like this
[862.36 - 866.24] so that we get injuries in our lungs and
[864.88 - 867.84] then for a lifetime we actually have
[866.24 - 869.56] scar tissue in our lungs like does that
[867.84 - 872.68] make any sense
[869.56 - 876.08] so I tell my friends and family it's
[872.68 - 878.28] critical to get B12 in you after
[876.08 - 880.32] especially after you've been hit with
[878.28 - 884.84] something because you need that extra
[880.32 - 887.48] B12 to power up the nerves so important
[884.84 - 889.44] that alone okay and so what I'm telling
[887.48 - 892.20] my family right now with all these these
[889.44 - 893.80] hard times of people getting sick cuz
[892.20 - 896.36] it's it's really sad when you see
[893.80 - 898.68] somebody really struggling they get what
[896.36 - 900.48] feels like a cold to start with then it
[898.68 - 902.44] then it lingers then it runs into a
[900.48 - 904.84] fever and up and down and then after
[902.44 - 907.04] that when they're better they're not
[904.84 - 909.84] better because now their immune system
[907.04 - 912.64] was dropped and they were triggered into
[909.84 - 915.88] something else an Epstein bar rising up
[912.64 - 917.40] out of nowhere herbus simplex one rising
[915.88 - 919.76] up from nowhere because that's what's
[917.40 - 921.96] happening to people people are getting
[919.76 - 924.76] shingles a month after they get white
[921.96 - 926.76] lung a month later they have the
[924.76 - 929.20] shingles because their immune system was
[926.76 - 931.08] so kicked down to the bottom that the
[929.20 - 933.52] jingles virus said this is my time to
[931.08 - 935.60] shine and then it comes up and it just
[933.52 - 937.36] boom it's up there let's talk about the
[935.60 - 938.80] Norovirus that's coming around and it's
[937.36 - 942.48] circulating right now and it's it's
[938.80 - 944.48] kicking up so right now there's a
[942.48 - 947.40] stomach bug out there and what people
[944.48 - 952.04] don't realize is that a stomach bug can
[947.40 - 955.92] knock your gut balance off for a really
[952.04 - 958.00] long time really long time but what you
[955.92 - 961.04] what you'll never see out there is what
[958.00 - 963.68] happens in inside the intestinal track
[961.04 - 966.08] when that bug is around so let's go into
[963.68 - 968.36] that let's let's try to like makeshift a
[966.08 - 971.56] little bit of an intestinal track
[968.36 - 975.12] okay so let's do that we'll make shift a
[971.56 - 979.40] little bit of a a colon here
[975.12 - 981.20] right all right and then we'll just do a
[979.40 - 984.92] little intestinal track in the center
[981.20 - 988.72] here if you guys can see this
[984.92 - 992.32] okay so you pick up the stomach flu pick
[988.72 - 995.40] up the neuro virus you get it in your
[992.32 - 997.24] mouth just goes in you you breathe it in
[995.40 - 1001.40] it's on your tongue now it's heading
[997.24 - 1004.88] down to your gut okay and it's on its
[1001.40 - 1008.12] way so that virus is getting there okay
[1004.88 - 1009.92] virus goes down the dadum it's it starts
[1008.12 - 1011.84] in your stomach right it goes down your
[1009.92 - 1015.16] stomach in your dadum it's heading in
[1011.84 - 1018.52] there and what that virus is doing is
[1015.16 - 1021.36] it's multiplying really fast and it's
[1018.52 - 1023.92] it's feeding off of foods that you eat
[1021.36 - 1026.76] so it's multiplying it's exploding so
[1023.92 - 1029.88] what a stomach virus does is it
[1026.76 - 1033.24] proliferates at a speed no other bug Pro
[1029.88 - 1036.00] proliferates no other bug fires up to
[1033.24 - 1038.76] that degree to multiplies to that degree
[1036.00 - 1040.08] spawns to that degree but the neuro
[1038.76 - 1044.16] virus
[1040.08 - 1047.28] explodes and it feeds off of undigested
[1044.16 - 1049.88] proteins it feeds off of gluten that's
[1047.28 - 1052.84] in the system from you ate a week ago
[1049.88 - 1056.12] yeah a week ago it feeds off of any egg
[1052.84 - 1058.88] residue egg material any kind of egg
[1056.12 - 1061.64] material in your gut it feeds off of
[1058.88 - 1063.80] that and then it feeds off of any dairy
[1061.64 - 1066.28] products and then it feeds off of other
[1063.80 - 1069.92] things it'll feed off of soy
[1066.28 - 1072.52] potentially it'll feed off of virtually
[1069.92 - 1078.60] anything right so what it does is it
[1072.52 - 1081.68] feeds and it explodes it produces itself
[1078.60 - 1084.88] rapidly like rapidly and it's highly
[1081.68 - 1088.32] toxic so what the neuro virus is is it's
[1084.88 - 1091.00] a bug that when it produces the bug then
[1088.32 - 1094.24] goes to the intestinal lining walls and
[1091.00 - 1095.84] it starts to make divots it starts to
[1094.24 - 1097.24] basically try to poke holes in your
[1095.84 - 1099.28] intestinal tract and your colon but
[1097.24 - 1101.80] nobody talks about this they're just
[1099.28 - 1104.08] like you got a stomach bug you know
[1101.80 - 1105.12] that's it wait till it's over and then
[1104.08 - 1107.72] take a
[1105.12 - 1109.08] probiotic so that's what they'll say
[1107.72 - 1110.16] some of the best functional medicine
[1109.08 - 1113.08] doctors to be like well you got a
[1110.16 - 1115.40] stomach flu um go to the hospital you
[1113.08 - 1119.08] got a stomach flu and then make sure you
[1115.40 - 1120.72] get on our probiotics at our clinic or
[1119.08 - 1124.00] or our doctor's office make sure you get
[1120.72 - 1126.64] on our probiotics so that's all they do
[1124.00 - 1132.00] but what people don't realize is that
[1126.64 - 1137.36] virus is mean really mean so stomach
[1132.00 - 1142.80] bugs stomach flues explode they multiply
[1137.36 - 1147.20] fast real fast thousands upon thousands
[1142.80 - 1149.72] of replicas then all those bugs end up
[1147.20 - 1153.16] attaching themselves to everything the
[1149.72 - 1155.12] stomach lining the dadum lining the
[1153.16 - 1158.64] small and top of the small intestinal
[1155.12 - 1160.96] tract all through and as it's happening
[1158.64 - 1163.60] if you have a weakened immune system
[1160.96 - 1167.24] it's not slowing it down it's not
[1163.60 - 1170.36] stopping it instead that person is now
[1167.24 - 1172.60] diarrhea they got stomach pains they're
[1170.36 - 1173.76] really nauseous they got a fever
[1172.60 - 1176.88] cranking
[1173.76 - 1179.92] up because their immune system isn't
[1176.88 - 1182.92] stopping it it's not breaking it down so
[1179.92 - 1185.80] their immune cells are not there's not
[1182.92 - 1188.32] enough immune cells number one to stop
[1185.80 - 1190.72] the neuro virus to that degree and if
[1188.32 - 1193.92] someone has a weakened immune system
[1190.72 - 1196.60] then they really have very small amounts
[1193.92 - 1199.40] of immune cells going into this area
[1196.60 - 1202.40] trying to stop the neuro virus
[1199.40 - 1205.44] so the neuro virus the stomach flu the
[1202.40 - 1207.84] stomach bugs what they do is they attack
[1205.44 - 1210.00] the Linings of the small intestinal
[1207.84 - 1212.52] tract and this is why people get Pockets
[1210.00 - 1215.52] later this is why people get divots
[1212.52 - 1217.84] diverticulitis diverticulos losis this
[1215.52 - 1221.52] is why people end up with crohn's later
[1217.84 - 1224.00] on meaning a trigger to get into Crohn's
[1221.52 - 1225.92] where other bugs can actually contribute
[1224.00 - 1228.44] it's all about knocking the immune
[1225.92 - 1229.72] system down allowing other problems to
[1228.44 - 1232.48] happen there's people who get stomach
[1229.72 - 1235.24] flu that never have a normal stomach
[1232.48 - 1236.92] intestinal tract ever again in their
[1235.24 - 1238.76] life they don't know how to recover it
[1236.92 - 1240.96] they know don't know how to rebuild it
[1238.76 - 1243.56] they don't know about Mono eating from
[1240.96 - 1245.32] the medical medium book series they
[1243.56 - 1247.96] don't know about all these different
[1245.32 - 1250.24] things they can do they're just stuck
[1247.96 - 1254.28] their intestinal tra is rocked for a
[1250.24 - 1256.40] very long time and then if they're older
[1254.28 - 1258.84] and they're not younger and they're
[1256.40 - 1260.48] older it affects them even more because
[1258.84 - 1264.16] they already have intestinal tract
[1260.48 - 1267.44] issues on so many levels so the neuro
[1264.16 - 1270.48] virus explodes and then it attaches
[1267.44 - 1272.88] itself to the Linings of the intestinal
[1270.48 - 1275.28] tract and if you're somebody that has
[1272.88 - 1276.84] pockets of undigested protein from a
[1275.28 - 1278.72] weak liver that I talked about in the
[1276.84 - 1281.28] last episode or if you're somebody
[1278.72 - 1283.80] that's dealing with anything like
[1281.28 - 1286.36] putrified rancid fats that are caked
[1283.80 - 1288.16] along your intestinal tract old fecal
[1286.36 - 1291.52] matter that's just stuck there and
[1288.16 - 1296.44] plastered against the intestinal Linings
[1291.52 - 1298.64] and bad bacteria like strep it all Rises
[1296.44 - 1301.00] up so the neuro virus and the stomach
[1298.64 - 1304.08] flu and the stomach bugs go ripping
[1301.00 - 1307.60] through you and then it awakens all the
[1304.08 - 1310.56] STP all the staff all the tiny bits of
[1307.60 - 1312.48] sea that you were keeping under control
[1310.56 - 1315.60] you know just managing your immune
[1312.48 - 1320.36] system was managing all this time and
[1315.60 - 1322.16] then what happens is we get triggered
[1320.36 - 1325.48] now we have all kinds of intestinal
[1322.16 - 1328.32] tract disturbances years later down the
[1325.48 - 1330.60] road a month later so as the virus is
[1328.32 - 1332.76] ripping through the gut it's clinging to
[1330.60 - 1335.68] the wall of the intestinal tract and it
[1332.76 - 1338.72] starts to try to burrow holes inside the
[1335.68 - 1341.52] intestinal tract just like white lung is
[1338.72 - 1343.96] doing to people when they're getting the
[1341.52 - 1346.32] sea and they're getting the flu and the
[1343.96 - 1350.00] C and the RSV and the white lung right
[1346.32 - 1353.92] now and it's going in it's injuring lung
[1350.00 - 1355.92] sacks well the stomach flu is
[1353.92 - 1359.00] created
[1355.92 - 1360.80] manufactured to injure the lining of
[1359.00 - 1365.84] your intestinal
[1360.80 - 1368.88] tract stomach dadum and so forth it's
[1365.84 - 1370.08] there to scar tissue and burrow and
[1368.88 - 1375.68] weaken the
[1370.08 - 1378.64] lining and wake up other predators that
[1375.68 - 1380.88] lie inside of our intestinal tract
[1378.64 - 1382.88] like the strep and the seiff and
[1380.88 - 1384.48] different varieties of staff and the
[1382.88 - 1387.20] hpylori
[1384.48 - 1389.64] so as that neuro virus and that stomach
[1387.20 - 1391.64] flu is ripping through and exploding and
[1389.64 - 1393.36] people are having like explosions of
[1391.64 - 1394.92] diarrhea and they're sick and they're
[1393.36 - 1397.48] nauseous and they're throwing up or
[1394.92 - 1400.32] they're fevered and they're getting the
[1397.48 - 1402.36] runs and they're really struggling for a
[1400.32 - 1403.56] day or two sometimes a week right now
[1402.36 - 1405.72] there's one that's ripping through
[1403.56 - 1408.88] that's really messing people up and when
[1405.72 - 1411.52] that's happening it wakes up strep it
[1408.88 - 1413.44] wakes up SEI it wakes up staff it wakes
[1411.52 - 1415.08] up other bugs like viruses that could be
[1413.44 - 1418.16] in the intestinal
[1415.08 - 1419.92] tract and then it tries to burrow holes
[1418.16 - 1424.36] in the Linings because that's what it
[1419.92 - 1427.60] does the bugs go in and they try to
[1424.36 - 1430.60] destroy tissue so they're cell
[1427.60 - 1433.56] destroyers the reason why we're having
[1430.60 - 1435.88] diarrhea and fever and everything else
[1433.56 - 1438.84] around it is cuz our body is
[1435.88 - 1441.16] reacting and mucus is is being produced
[1438.84 - 1443.40] off the lining of her intestinal tract
[1441.16 - 1445.68] because it's burrowing little holes tiny
[1443.40 - 1448.12] little divots in her intestinal tract
[1445.68 - 1451.84] and so our intestinal tract is releasing
[1448.12 - 1455.72] gobs and gobs of mucus and water and
[1451.84 - 1459.00] mucus and it's just straming out it's
[1455.72 - 1462.64] streaming out to try to defend against
[1459.00 - 1464.92] the Invader but the Invader causes a lot
[1462.64 - 1467.24] of Havoc reaches a lot reaks a lot of
[1464.92 - 1468.44] havoc and a probiotic is not going to
[1467.24 - 1471.40] fix it
[1468.44 - 1473.52] after a really bad stomach flu a fever
[1471.40 - 1477.16] and also intestinal tract being invaded
[1473.52 - 1479.48] like that it takes time to heal it takes
[1477.16 - 1481.72] time to eat the right Foods it takes
[1479.48 - 1485.28] time to understand what you're doing and
[1481.72 - 1486.84] it's critical to keep the immune system
[1485.28 - 1489.12] strong
[1486.84 - 1490.28] so I just wanted to show you that right
[1489.12 - 1494.08] there and there's other stuff to talk
[1490.28 - 1496.28] about because we are here talking about
[1494.08 - 1499.76] the fun stuff for sure all right then
[1496.28 - 1499.76] move this over a little bit
[1499.88 - 1505.84] okay it takes a tremendous amount of
[1502.96 - 1509.08] adrenaline to fend off any bug that's
[1505.84 - 1512.04] out there right now any kind of flu any
[1509.08 - 1513.96] kind of C any kind of white lung RSV any
[1512.04 - 1515.00] kind of neuro virus or stomach virus it
[1513.96 - 1518.00] takes
[1515.00 - 1520.48] adrenaline heart rate goes
[1518.00 - 1523.68] up as you're getting sick your heart
[1520.48 - 1525.72] rate goes up that's how it works because
[1523.68 - 1529.48] epinephrine is being released adrenaline
[1525.72 - 1531.96] is being released to try to protect you
[1529.48 - 1535.24] but adrenaline itself doesn't help the
[1531.96 - 1537.08] immune system so what these bugs do and
[1535.24 - 1540.84] these viruses do that get into us when
[1537.08 - 1544.00] they get into us our adrenals end up
[1540.84 - 1546.88] fire alarming it and releasing all this
[1544.00 - 1549.48] adrenaline to try to because that's
[1546.88 - 1551.04] actually this response this automics
[1549.48 - 1554.16] response that's happening immediately
[1551.04 - 1556.52] when an Invader enters into our system
[1554.16 - 1559.40] but as it's happening our immune cells
[1556.52 - 1561.08] are struggling even more because we have
[1559.40 - 1564.12] so much adrenaline pouring into our
[1561.08 - 1567.60] bloodstream and immune cells hate
[1564.12 - 1569.80] adrenaline hate adrenaline it holds them
[1567.60 - 1571.96] back it keeps them from functioning as
[1569.80 - 1573.88] good as they can function so our immune
[1571.96 - 1576.20] cells need
[1573.88 - 1579.16] fuel need
[1576.20 - 1582.68] fuel and that's why I talk about like I
[1579.16 - 1586.16] have my family and my closest friends on
[1582.68 - 1588.64] protocols I have them on supplements
[1586.16 - 1591.20] it's critical because when you get sick
[1588.64 - 1594.04] if you're somewhere and look no one has
[1591.20 - 1595.84] no one has it perfect where well man you
[1594.04 - 1598.40] know what I could be wrong about that
[1595.84 - 1600.92] there's people on Instagram that they
[1598.40 - 1602.88] never have to work a day in their life
[1600.92 - 1604.92] right they're young they come for money
[1602.88 - 1607.12] or something or they're just extremely
[1604.92 - 1608.48] wealthy or whatever it is everything's
[1607.12 - 1610.64] taken care of and all they have to do is
[1608.48 - 1612.76] sleep 12 hours every night they could
[1610.64 - 1615.04] sleep as many hours as they want they
[1612.76 - 1616.16] don't have to stress out about work they
[1615.04 - 1617.76] don't have to they just worry about
[1616.16 - 1618.92] their appointments their stress is their
[1617.76 - 1620.80] appointments like I'm getting my
[1618.92 - 1622.72] lymphatic drainage here I'm getting this
[1620.80 - 1624.56] here I'm doing this here I'm going on a
[1622.72 - 1625.96] vacation here with my friends here I'm
[1624.56 - 1629.16] going to Europe whatever it is that's
[1625.96 - 1632.12] their stress right and there are people
[1629.16 - 1633.68] like that and they can at least protect
[1632.12 - 1636.04] themselves because they're not living
[1633.68 - 1637.88] with a lot of real life scenarios
[1636.04 - 1640.48] situations they're not trying to work
[1637.88 - 1642.08] three jobs to survive they don't have
[1640.48 - 1643.80] you know like all these problems in
[1642.08 - 1645.40] their life meaning from other family
[1643.80 - 1647.64] members or something happening and they
[1645.40 - 1649.76] don't you know there's a lot going on in
[1647.64 - 1651.32] a lot of people's lives and we can't
[1649.76 - 1653.48] help it because there's so many people
[1651.32 - 1656.16] that don't have that perfect life life
[1653.48 - 1657.76] where they can just relax all day long
[1656.16 - 1659.68] and never have to worry about working a
[1657.76 - 1661.00] day in their life you know there's a lot
[1659.68 - 1663.56] of people that are struggling and they
[1661.00 - 1665.40] have to fight to survive and when you do
[1663.56 - 1666.80] that right we're always up against a lot
[1665.40 - 1669.24] and it's important to keep our immune
[1666.80 - 1671.00] system strong and in the eventually
[1669.24 - 1672.96] someone who has it really good in their
[1671.00 - 1674.76] life and they're young and strong now
[1672.96 - 1676.48] still will get symptoms later they'll
[1674.76 - 1678.32] still wind up in trouble they'll still
[1676.48 - 1681.60] wind up sick I see see it all the time
[1678.32 - 1684.40] but it usually comes later instead of
[1681.60 - 1687.04] early let's see sole purpose on IG says
[1684.40 - 1690.48] my fiance was just sick three times in
[1687.04 - 1693.64] six weeks flu bug stomach flu bug and
[1690.48 - 1695.80] then flu bug again now lots of crazy

[1695.80 - 1699.92] medium protocols this week now that's
[1697.76 - 1700.88] exactly the example I'm so sorry you're
[1699.92 - 1702.76] going through that first of all I want
[1700.88 - 1704.92] to say that that's awful that's awful
[1702.76 - 1706.92] but that's how they set it up you have
[1704.92 - 1710.84] to understand that's how they set it up
[1706.92 - 1712.64] so that's what they do okay so let's do
[1710.84 - 1714.80] a a different little thing on the
[1712.64 - 1717.08] Whiteboard okay I don't know why my
[1714.80 - 1719.60] whiteboard doesn't really work that

[1751.48 - 1756.12] that's what that is that's right that's
[1754.12 - 1758.96] the bug manufacturing
[1756.12 - 1760.84] plant yes

[1780.84 - 1787.56] chimneys here whatever that's the
[1783.80 - 1790.36] village The Village the innocent
[1787.56 - 1795.04] people okay there it
[1790.36 - 1797.48] is and the manufacturing plant they just
[1795.04 - 1799.36] let out all kinds of stuff out there
[1797.48 - 1802.88] front
[1799.36 - 1804.12] door is what they do they let out lots
[1802.88 - 1807.72] of
[1804.12 - 1810.92] bugs lots of bugs and they do it
[1807.72 - 1814.52] purposely and they time it just right
[1810.92 - 1818.52] okay and these bugs end up going to the
[1814.52 - 1818.52] village and everybody gets
[1818.56 - 1825.08] sick apologize for my my writing
[1822.76 - 1829.24] my Artistry
[1825.08 - 1829.24] skills I did not go to Art School
[1829.92 - 1836.80] and uh I wish I did I really do anyway
[1833.76 - 1841.08] listen so check this out you guys bugs
[1836.80 - 1844.60] are layered on top of bugs purposely so
[1841.08 - 1847.96] they release them with a
[1844.60 - 1850.08] schedule okay so there's a
[1847.96 - 1854.00] schedule there it is
[1850.08 - 1856.52] here got all the different days of the
[1854.00 - 1857.88] month right here's the first here's the
[1856.52 - 1862.20] second here's the Third third the fourth
[1857.88 - 1866.64] the 5ifth each month they release one
[1862.20 - 1868.64] flu bug on the first of whatever day of
[1866.64 - 1871.12] the month they want to release it
[1868.64 - 1873.36] on when they know it's gotten out there
[1871.12 - 1875.16] good enough and it's running its course
[1873.36 - 1877.56] they time it and they have schedules and
[1875.16 - 1879.44] they release another one on another
[1877.56 - 1883.68] month maybe they'll release it on the
[1879.44 - 1887.56] third okay they layer the manufactured
[1883.68 - 1892.88] bugs purposely so it kicks the crap out
[1887.56 - 1896.52] of people they want you to be triggered
[1892.88 - 1900.04] and injured so you're kept down and you
[1896.52 - 1903.56] feed the system that's how it's done see
[1900.04 - 1906.68] so you catch the one flu six weeks ago
[1903.56 - 1909.60] you catch another flu three weeks ago
[1906.68 - 1912.68] you catch the stomach flu last week it's
[1909.60 - 1914.48] layered they put them out like that and
[1912.68 - 1918.00] they want everybody in the village to
[1914.48 - 1920.96] get sick everybody and they want older
[1918.00 - 1924.96] people elderly people to
[1920.96 - 1927.80] die correct they want them to die and
[1924.96 - 1930.04] get knocked off that's how it's done
[1927.80 - 1933.76] they want them sick and they want them
[1930.04 - 1937.76] gone that's how the system is set up
[1933.76 - 1937.76] it's a kind of a fun little system isn't
[1938.66 - 1941.79] [Music]
[1942.36 - 1947.64] it they manufacture the bugs and they
[1945.24 - 1949.76] then they stick the bugs in a
[1947.64 - 1952.76] containment unit with a bunch of white
[1949.76 - 1954.68] mice and they see if the mice all die
[1952.76 - 1957.20] and they see if the mice live they see
[1954.68 - 1960.68] if the mice chalk you know cough and
[1957.20 - 1964.40] choke on fleem they see if the mice have
[1960.68 - 1966.84] diarrhea all around the mouse
[1964.40 - 1968.68] tank and then they kind of say well
[1966.84 - 1972.68] we're ready and they eventually let it
[1968.68 - 1975.44] out that's the system it's the way it's
[1972.68 - 1977.36] built lady Kath over there in IG just
[1975.44 - 1979.56] said I really appreciate how how you
[1977.36 - 1981.36] pointed out that most of us have so many
[1979.56 - 1984.56] stresses bringing down our immune
[1981.36 - 1988.76] systems indeed everybody does I am
[1984.56 - 1991.00] included in that I am not immune to that
[1988.76 - 1994.80] I have stress just like anybody else
[1991.00 - 1996.92] plenty of it in fact a lot of it and
[1994.80 - 1999.08] that's what happens when you have the
[1996.92 - 2001.56] most healing stories on the planet of
[1999.08 - 2003.20] people healing you have the most people
[2001.56 - 2005.84] with multiple sceris that got out of
[2003.20 - 2009.32] wheelchairs in
[2005.84 - 2011.56] history the the information that's so
[2009.32 - 2013.20] Advanced every single you know somebody
[2011.56 - 2015.04] who's somebody in the influencer world
[2013.20 - 2016.08] is stealing and poaching it and using it
[2015.04 - 2018.04] because they can't get their own
[2016.08 - 2020.16] information and all these people are
[2018.04 - 2022.80] healing around the world and it creates
[2020.16 - 2024.28] tremendous amount of stress that's how
[2022.80 - 2026.48] it works you're not allowed to get
[2024.28 - 2027.84] people better in large quantities you're
[2026.48 - 2030.20] allowed to get one or two people better
[2027.84 - 2031.80] and be like hey I got somebody better
[2030.20 - 2033.56] you're not allowed to get millions of
[2031.80 - 2035.20] people better hundreds of thousands of
[2033.56 - 2037.36] people better that weren't supposed to
[2035.20 - 2039.04] get better you're not allowed to do that
[2037.36 - 2043.16] not on planet
[2039.04 - 2043.16] Earth so my stress is
[2043.24 - 2048.64] great chamia says Anthony the flu bug
[2046.32 - 2051.32] got around our household but we were
[2048.64 - 2054.44] able to stop it in its tracks with
[2051.32 - 2057.28] vitamin C shock and zinc shock therapy

[2141.56 - 2146.32] this right here do you guys know about
[2143.04 - 2147.48] this can I show you this is also a
[2146.32 - 2149.52] collagen
[2147.48 - 2151.76] Builder and the one thing about medical
[2149.52 - 2155.68] medium information is I was the first to
[2151.76 - 2157.56] blow the horn on the BS [ __ ]
[2155.68 - 2159.36] collagen Market
[2157.56 - 2161.76] where the collagen Market was selling
[2159.36 - 2164.12] all this collagen but you can't build
[2161.76 - 2167.20] collagen eating collagen just like you
[2164.12 - 2170.36] can't fix your eye eating an eyeball you
[2167.20 - 2174.40] can't eat a pig's eyeball to fix your
[2170.36 - 2176.76] eyeball you can't eat a liver to fix
[2174.40 - 2179.64] your liver it doesn't work that's not
[2176.76 - 2182.68] how it works you can't rebuild collagen
[2179.64 - 2185.40] in your body you can't rebuild collagen
[2182.68 - 2187.08] in your body eating collagen it's not
[2185.40 - 2189.48] going to happen so Medical medium
[2187.08 - 2192.16] information was the first to call that
[2189.48 - 2195.28] out that you can't get better on
[2192.16 - 2198.44] collagen you can only build your
[2195.28 - 2200.40] collagen with collagen Builders that's
[2198.44 - 2203.12] how you do
[2200.40 - 2204.16] it all right so I got some water heated
[2203.12 - 2206.04] up right
[2204.16 - 2208.48] here I'm going to add a little bit of
[2206.04 - 2211.40] orange juice to this as well this is the
[2208.48 - 2214.56] vitamin C shock
[2211.40 - 2216.24] therapy this water got a little toasty a
[2214.56 - 2219.68] little bit toastier than I probably
[2216.24 - 2222.36] wanted it so let me get some nice
[2219.68 - 2224.96] cold orange juice in there fresh
[2222.36 - 2228.92] squeezed orange juice look at
[2224.96 - 2232.20] that nice can I have a double espresso

[2246.40 - 2252.68] for the skin and credible for the skin
[2249.56 - 2256.84] credible for the immune system that's an
[2252.68 - 2260.64] immune Builder difference huge

[2397.00 - 2401.00] and that's a whole game changer all on
[2398.88 - 2403.24] its own I mean this this is actually
[2401.00 - 2404.48] exciting this cheers me up because I've

[2412.16 - 2417.16] vitamin C right the micro C and let me
[2415.44 - 2420.52] just be clear about this so you guys
[2417.16 - 2423.56] know okay if you're interested this
[2420.52 - 2426.76] isn't ascorbic acid this isn't the thing
[2423.56 - 2428.00] that burns holes in people's stomachs
[2426.76 - 2429.84] that that's what I'm talking about
[2428.00 - 2432.76] that's a different difference with
[2429.84 - 2434.04] fmer that is the difference right there
[2432.76 - 2436.56] because people don't realize that they
[2434.04 - 2437.76] go and take the ascorbic acid and next
[2436.56 - 2439.76] thing you know they got the runs they
[2437.76 - 2441.88] got diarrhea they got stomach upset it's
[2439.76 - 2444.00] burning their Linings it's burning their
[2441.88 - 2445.92] gut if they're sensitive they had ulcers
[2444.00 - 2448.20] in the past and they're taking all that
[2445.92 - 2451.20] ascorbic acid it's sitting there like
[2448.20 - 2454.20] sizzling up the ulcers like I I can't I
[2451.20 - 2457.12] can't even go even go there like I will
[2454.20 - 2460.08] never take an escor acid straight

[2462.08 - 2466.48] nothing else available out there in the
[2464.92 - 2470.12] world I've taken it when there was
[2466.48 - 2473.08] nothing available I will never ever ever
[2470.12 - 2477.20] take an escorp Bic a TR scor Bic acid

[2578.56 - 2581.88] little real quick here we're talking
[2579.96 - 2586.48] about neuro virus we're talking about
[2581.88 - 2588.60] flu we're talking about um C RSV white
[2586.48 - 2591.04] lung but then we're talking about like
[2588.60 - 2592.36] what happens when the scale is tips so
[2591.04 - 2593.76] much you guys you know how I've been
[2592.36 - 2595.64] talking about the scale tipping all this
[2593.76 - 2598.20] time and and death by a Thousand Cuts
[2595.64 - 2599.84] for like years right and now I just saw
[2598.20 - 2601.56] like someone just said that someone was
[2599.84 - 2603.24] on a podcast like some influencer guy
[2601.56 - 2605.24] was on some podcast doctor or something
[2603.24 - 2607.24] was on a podcast and talking about scale
[2605.24 - 2609.52] tipping
[2607.24 - 2612.32] Death By A Thousand Cuts like dude get
[2609.52 - 2614.48] your own stuff get your own
[2612.32 - 2616.60] stuff but that's what's happening the
[2614.48 - 2619.28] scale is tipping and that's what these
[2616.60 - 2621.56] bugs do it knocks them down and their
[2619.28 - 2624.08] immune system then struggles their
[2621.56 - 2627.48] immune system is already struggling and
[2624.08 - 2630.16] now they're sick and it's unfair it's
[2627.48 - 2633.04] not right that this happens to people we
[2630.16 - 2636.80] shouldn't have to live our lives sick
[2633.04 - 2639.68] life is short and as it is life is short
[2636.80 - 2642.40] as it is okay we're not living to 500
[2639.68 - 2644.52] years old we're not living to 400 years
[2642.40 - 2649.12] old right it's another story I want to

[2767.40 - 2772.24] the medical medium information how sick
[2769.44 - 2775.72] is that pretending they came up with it

[2797.96 - 2805.56] get notified yeah I know okay okay so
[2802.72 - 2809.96] the total immune is really revolutionary
[2805.56 - 2811.76] all on its own okay it's like with me I
[2809.96 - 2812.88] I know that people need their immune
[2811.76 - 2816.84] system
[2812.88 - 2819.84] strengthened but they need them rebuilt
[2816.84 - 2823.84] rebuilt not just fortified not just
[2819.84 - 2827.00] strengthened not just supported but
[2823.84 - 2829.00] rebuilt because that's the kind of
[2827.00 - 2832.28] immune system trouble so many people are
[2829.00 - 2835.40] in thyroid problems hypo hyper you know
[2832.28 - 2837.80] nodules cysts on the thyroid whether
[2835.40 - 2840.16] they're tiny or large people that deal
[2837.80 - 2842.48] with all kinds of issues under the sun
[2840.16 - 2844.72] everything from neurological problems
[2842.48 - 2846.60] from skin problems our immune systems
[2844.72 - 2849.96] are under attack
[2846.60 - 2851.96] from everything from fragrances and
[2849.96 - 2853.56] anything people who drink alcohol it's
[2851.96 - 2855.88] another thing did you know that it was
[2853.56 - 2858.64] taboo you guys on another note can't
[2855.88 - 2863.80] help it you know that it was taboo to
[2858.64 - 2867.28] either to utter the word you can't do
[2863.80 - 2869.48] alcohol like it's bad for you it's not
[2867.28 - 2871.84] good for you it's not going to help you
[2869.48 - 2874.84] even all the vegan
[2871.84 - 2877.56] doctors podcast doctors all drink all
[2874.84 - 2881.44] drink wine champagne everything right
[2877.56 - 2883.60] vodka all drink okay and then suddenly
[2881.44 - 2885.68] now years after I've been talking about
[2883.60 - 2887.60] how bad alcohol is and I was getting
[2885.68 - 2889.24] crap for it that was taboo you weren't
[2887.60 - 2890.84] allowed to talk about it on a podcast
[2889.24 - 2893.04] anywhere you weren't allowed to talk
[2890.84 - 2895.68] about it on social you mentioned that
[2893.04 - 2897.88] alcohol was bad everybody The Gauntlet
[2895.68 - 2900.80] came down on you man to chop off your
[2897.88 - 2902.28] head I'm not kidding but yet I stayed
[2900.80 - 2904.08] with it stayed with it stayed with it
[2902.28 - 2906.60] talked about the books stayed with it
[2904.08 - 2908.36] was heavy on it said no you can't do
[2906.60 - 2911.12] this if you want to heal you got to get
[2908.36 - 2912.88] off alcohol it's bad for you whatever
[2911.12 - 2915.28] and then now guess what they're all
[2912.88 - 2916.72] paring it now like yeah alcohol is bad
[2915.28 - 2919.52] for your brain really cuz science
[2916.72 - 2923.08] doesn't say that where did you get that
[2919.52 - 2924.28] idea all right look what I like about
[2923.08 - 2927.48] total
[2924.28 - 2929.28] immune okay
[2927.48 - 2932.32] is
[2929.28 - 2935.12] um the fact that it works that's just
[2932.32 - 2938.04] one right off the the bat me me over
[2935.12 - 2940.36] there on on YouTube I noticed that Mayo
[2938.04 - 2943.48] Clinic Now talks about non- rashing
[2940.36 - 2945.48] shingles no mention of the source um
[2943.48 - 2947.64] there is a hijacking of the medical
[2945.48 - 2951.32] medium non- rashing shingles information
[2947.64 - 2953.96] both there at Mayo PubMed wherever all
[2951.32 - 2955.44] of all of it like they've just hijacked
[2953.96 - 2957.76] medical medium information with no
[2955.44 - 2960.60] science and no studies behind it no
[2957.76 - 2963.04] studies behind it and when you look when
[2960.60 - 2964.96] you look at whatever they show check
[2963.04 - 2967.48] this out how sick is this when they look
[2964.96 - 2971.48] when you look they show they're talking
[2967.48 - 2972.72] about post herpetic pain when the rash
[2971.48 - 2975.40] goes
[2972.72 - 2978.28] away but they're trying to chalk that up
[2975.40 - 2980.80] as it it's non- rashing shingles no they
[2978.28 - 2982.60] had the rash it went away and then they
[2980.80 - 2984.80] had pain for a year so science of
[2982.60 - 2988.84] research did do a couple of papers where
[2984.80 - 2990.88] you have pain for a year or more after
[2988.84 - 2992.80] shingles but that's not non- rashing
[2990.88 - 2994.80] shingles non- rashing shingles is
[2992.80 - 2997.68] medical medium information it's having
[2994.80 - 2999.84] shingles never a rash ever and having
[2997.68 - 3002.04] symptoms right well now they're claiming
[2999.84 - 3003.68] they knew that when they didn't no signs
[3002.04 - 3005.36] to back it up but mayo and everybody
[3003.68 - 3009.72] else is using medical meme information
[3005.36 - 3012.08] on that just CRA it's crazy you know
[3009.72 - 3015.36] what there's you know there's good news
[3012.08 - 3018.36] though because they're so evil that when
[3015.36 - 3021.88] you leave here that evil and you don't
[3018.36 - 3025.04] make good with that you don't resolve it
[3021.88 - 3028.48] you don't you don't work on that you
[3025.04 - 3030.32] don't clean about like how many people
[3028.48 - 3031.92] you screwed over with chronic illness
[3030.32 - 3033.80] that couldn't get back to the source to
[3031.92 - 3035.36] heal and it's your fault that so many
[3033.80 - 3038.36] people aren't going to heal because you
[3035.36 - 3040.56] were evil and you didn't care and you
[3038.36 - 3043.08] stole that information to just
[3040.56 - 3046.00] manipulate people and then you're on
[3043.08 - 3048.08] your deathbed many years down the road
[3046.00 - 3051.28] you think you're just in the clear with
[3048.08 - 3051.28] that you think you're in the
[3051.84 - 3057.76] clear I see my medicinal home on YouTube
[3055.64 - 3061.56] propolis shock therapy is in the brain
[3057.76 - 3064.48] saver protocol book it helped heal my
[3061.56 - 3065.84] canker sorce and that's the propolis
[3064.48 - 3067.36] right there I'll give you a close-up on
[3065.84 - 3070.80] the propolis you
[3067.36 - 3075.28] guys I mean honestly look if you look if
[3070.80 - 3077.96] if you can get one thing one thing okay
[3075.28 - 3081.32] you can't you can't lose with total
[3077.96 - 3083.64] immune you can't lose the propolis pure
[3081.32 - 3086.36] if you can get two things it's like
[3083.64 - 3088.88] total immune propolis pure
[3086.36 - 3091.92] right if you can get two things that's
[3088.88 - 3094.24] how critical that is for our immune
[3091.92 - 3096.56] systems right there that's how critical
[3094.24 - 3098.64] that is all right you guys we're talking
[3096.56 - 3101.20] about all kinds of good stuff flu and
[3098.64 - 3104.08] everything else in post flu and post RSV
[3101.20 - 3105.36] RSV and white lung and neuro viruses
[3104.08 - 3107.64] which are going around and we talked
[3105.36 - 3109.88] about like manufacturing they got the
[3107.64 - 3111.96] manufacturing plant right there they're
[3109.88 - 3114.44] growing the viruses spawning them right
[3111.96 - 3117.36] out of eggs themselves and then they get
[3114.44 - 3119.44] released Magic Al into our environment
[3117.36 - 3121.16] and it hits the village right here and
[3119.44 - 3122.16] then they calculate it on the calendar
[3121.16 - 3123.52] of when they're going to release the
[3122.16 - 3125.48] next one and next one because they want
[3123.52 - 3127.36] to clobber the crap out of everybody's
[3125.48 - 3131.52] immune system and they want elderly
[3127.36 - 3131.52] people to die early so that's the
[3132.56 - 3137.24] plan and if you don't believe it then
[3134.68 - 3140.40] fine it's all make
[3137.24 - 3142.32] believe sure we can think that maybe
[3140.40 - 3145.52] it's just all make believe and it never
[3142.32 - 3147.68] happens no and that's fine whatever want
[3145.52 - 3149.44] to think but yeah it's interesting isn't
[3147.68 - 3152.84] it all right so what I'm doing right
[3149.44 - 3155.04] here is I am I got my total immune right
[3152.84 - 3157.20] there I take shots of it I put it in the
[3155.04 - 3159.52] shot glass just like this
[3157.20 - 3160.80] okay and I'm going to pop a little bit
[3159.52 - 3162.44] of orange ju so I want to talk about
[3160.80 - 3164.52] this there's a lot of people that even
[3162.44 - 3166.00] know these don't taste bad these taste

[3169.32 - 3174.08] like to use water they can use juice
[3172.00 - 3176.00] then so here I got some fresh squeezed
[3174.08 - 3179.00] orange juice and pouring in in there it
[3176.00 - 3182.16] is and

[3290.08 - 3298.24] production coordinator for a TV show and
[3293.32 - 3302.44] work 6 pm to 4 a.m. hey you're on my
[3298.24 - 3305.48] schedule that's amazing but am often up
[3302.44 - 3308.92] until 5 to 6: a.m. how do I need to
[3305.48 - 3312.76] supplement my body first and foremost
[3308.92 - 3314.60] right always remember that even if
[3312.76 - 3316.24] you're not sleeping if you're just
[3314.60 - 3317.84] laying there and you're resting your
[3316.24 - 3320.12] nerves and your eyes are shut your
[3317.84 - 3322.84] immune system is recovering just from
[3320.12 - 3324.32] that alone and I want to say this this
[3322.84 - 3326.20] is very important for people who can't
[3324.32 - 3329.60] sleep or can't get enough sleep they're
[3326.20 - 3331.72] working hard everything's off right is
[3329.60 - 3334.08] that when you're even laying there
[3331.72 - 3336.04] you're laying there and you're calm and
[3334.08 - 3338.32] you're shutting your eyes your immune
[3336.04 - 3340.56] system is responding and it's
[3338.32 - 3342.12] reproducing and it's building back up
[3340.56 - 3343.96] even if you're just laying there you
[3342.12 - 3345.80] guys keep that in mind even if you're
[3343.96 - 3347.36] somebody who's struggling with insomnia
[3345.80 - 3349.64] or you have some kind of sleep issue
[3347.36 - 3352.04] your immune system is sitting there
[3349.64 - 3353.56] building and rebuilding up when when
[3352.04 - 3355.60] you're actually just laying there with
[3353.56 - 3358.40] your eyes shut relaxing relxing keep
[3355.60 - 3360.76] that in mind right there okay what I
[3358.40 - 3363.80] would do if I was on your schedule which
[3360.76 - 3366.44] I am on your schedule pretty much I'll
[3363.80 - 3368.00] work 20 hour days whatever and I'm on
[3366.44 - 3369.52] your schedule where I'm working all
[3368.00 - 3374.68] through the night too I've done that so
[3369.52 - 3378.56] many times I crank up my micro c i Crank
[3374.68 - 3381.64] It Up that is something I do I crank up
[3378.56 - 3383.84] the the micro I crank up the
[3381.64 - 3387.12] B12 these are some of the things that I
[3383.84 - 3390.12] do and then I I focus on hydration I
[3387.12 - 3393.44] focus on a little bit of coconut water I
[3390.12 - 3396.16] focus on right my celery juice I if I
[3393.44 - 3398.52] can if I can get it done I I focus on
[3396.16 - 3402.52] that um there's there's other things too
[3398.52 - 3404.28] but and I don't eat really heavy meals
[3402.52 - 3407.84] that's one thing right there I don't eat
[3404.28 - 3411.16] real heavy dense meals that are fatty I
[3407.84 - 3413.60] don't eat big fatty meals when I'm
[3411.16 - 3416.04] underslept because that's a recipe right
[3413.60 - 3418.96] there for a heart attack right there
[3416.04 - 3421.32] you're eating heavily ladened fat yeah
[3418.96 - 3422.56] overt fat meals now all the vegans are
[3421.32 - 3424.28] doing overt fats that's what they're
[3422.56 - 3426.08] doing they're all doing overt fats all
[3424.28 - 3429.12] the animal protein people they're all
[3426.08 - 3430.32] doing overt fats if you're not if you're
[3429.12 - 3433.76] working really hard and you're not
[3430.32 - 3436.60] sleeping much cranking up over fats it's
[3433.76 - 3438.56] like asking for a heart attack I mean so
[3436.60 - 3441.36] then so I make sure that that's not
[3438.56 - 3443.20] happening that's important on its
[3441.36 - 3445.60] own
[3443.20 - 3447.00] yep great information you guys talk
[3445.60 - 3448.72] about rebuilding the immune system a
[3447.00 - 3451.16] little bit couple things you can do
[3448.72 - 3453.40] right okay I was going to the top of the
[3451.16 - 3455.88] list what you'll see out there it's
[3453.40 - 3458.32] happening now it's like great ways 10
[3455.88 - 3462.44] great ways to rebuild your immune system
[3458.32 - 3465.60] sleep a crap ton of hours um stay away
[3462.44 - 3467.84] from fried greasy food um and you know
[3465.60 - 3469.20] the list goes on right there's a whole a
[3467.84 - 3474.56] whole bunch of things out there like
[3469.20 - 3477.88] that okay and so my list is making sure
[3474.56 - 3481.00] I got enough zinc making sure I got the
[3477.88 - 3484.16] micro SE making sure I'm taking my
[3481.00 - 3487.68] propolis pure every single day making
[3484.16 - 3490.96] sure I am hydrated but not hydrated with
[3487.68 - 3495.36] like garbage stuff not hydrated with
[3490.96 - 3497.96] with um you know alkaline water um you
[3495.36 - 3499.48] know uh products and stuff like that on
[3497.96 - 3501.68] the Shelf where they're like this is
[3499.48 - 3503.92] alkaline water and you guys seen what's
[3501.68 - 3506.04] happening out there right there's some
[3503.92 - 3507.04] bad stuff that's happen it's terrible
[3506.04 - 3509.36] it's terrible and I've been telling
[3507.04 - 3512.44] people stay away from alkaline water
[3509.36 - 3513.80] crap that's out there I've been how many
[3512.44 - 3515.72] how many years have I told people to
[3513.80 - 3518.28] stay away from that and look what just
[3515.72 - 3520.16] happened I mean it was just terrifying
[3518.28 - 3522.76] what just happened to people out there
[3520.16 - 3524.76] right it's like you know like there's a
[3522.76 - 3527.60] lot of things that I do to keep the
[3524.76 - 3531.24] immune system strong and you know what I
[3527.60 - 3533.92] do is I eat every couple of hours so
[3531.24 - 3535.40] that my adrenals aren't flooding so if
[3533.92 - 3536.68] you want to keep your immune system
[3535.40 - 3537.80] strong you want to build your immune
[3536.68 - 3540.68] system back
[3537.80 - 3544.20] up you make sure you're not trashing
[3540.68 - 3547.60] your adrenals get caffeine out of
[3544.20 - 3549.20] there get caffeine out that's critical
[3547.60 - 3551.20] by the way there's no science behind
[3549.20 - 3552.72] caffeine hurting the immune system but
[3551.20 - 3554.24] recently I saw something out there of
[3552.72 - 3555.60] somebody like yeah stay away from
[3554.24 - 3557.80] caffeine really because there's no
[3555.60 - 3561.04] science that says it they science says
[3557.80 - 3563.00] caffeine is good for you it's
[3561.04 - 3565.80] crazy
[3563.00 - 3568.60] so how it is the point is is staying
[3565.80 - 3571.12] away from caffeine eating every couple
[3568.60 - 3573.76] of hours don't intermittent
[3571.12 - 3575.72] fast when you want to rebuild your and
[3573.76 - 3578.04] recover your immune system don't do the
[3575.72 - 3580.04] intermittent fasting where you're on
[3578.04 - 3581.68] coffee all day then you eat a big greasy
[3580.04 - 3583.68] fried meal at the end of the night or a
[3581.68 - 3585.80] big overt fat meal at the end of the
[3583.68 - 3587.68] night I'm intermittent fasting my
[3585.80 - 3590.48] stomach's staying down I'm not as
[3587.68 - 3592.64] bloated at night I could eat what I want
[3590.48 - 3594.92] yeah you just trashed your adrenals
[3592.64 - 3597.72] people who intermittent fast they seem
[3594.92 - 3600.40] to improve improve but do you hear about
[3597.72 - 3603.96] like things like 5 years later ask him
[3600.40 - 3605.96] then oh yeah um well uh I don't know my
[3603.96 - 3607.48] health has been really gone to [ __ ] um
[3605.96 - 3608.80] all these different things yeah but you
[3607.48 - 3610.44] were on social media talking about how
[3608.80 - 3612.24] your urit and fasting four years ago and
[3610.44 - 3613.96] how great you were doing yeah but then I
[3612.24 - 3616.44] went to carnivore and then I got really
[3613.96 - 3618.64] sick on Carnivore and then I tried this
[3616.44 - 3620.36] and then I tried that and I was trying
[3618.64 - 3622.40] this new program that I just purchased
[3620.36 - 3623.96] for $5,000 from this guy that says he's
[3622.40 - 3626.40] a chiropractor or something like and
[3623.96 - 3628.08] then I just did this and did that and
[3626.40 - 3629.64] people are just like they're everywhere
[3628.08 - 3632.40] and it's like Yeah because it didn't
[3629.64 - 3634.44] work intermittent fasting burns out the
[3632.40 - 3636.84] adrenals so what I like to do is I like
[3634.44 - 3640.28] to eat every couple of hours I'll have a
[3636.84 - 3642.96] banana I'll have some oranges
[3640.28 - 3645.20] right I'll eat some
[3642.96 - 3648.44] cucumbers right I'll drink my celery
[3645.20 - 3650.44] juice I'll have a little coconut water
[3648.44 - 3653.80] okay I'll have some fresh squeezed you
[3650.44 - 3655.44] know fresh squeezed orange juice okay
[3653.80 - 3658.44] and then but I'll be I'll be eating I'll
[3655.44 - 3660.60] be eating I'll have some dates but I'll
[3658.44 - 3663.36] be eating every couple of hours I'll
[3660.60 - 3666.12] have some greens I some colored greens
[3663.36 - 3668.12] and some dates and I'll just eat them
[3666.12 - 3670.28] together I'll have some kale on some dat
[3668.12 - 3671.92] I'm just saying that this is what I do
[3670.28 - 3673.64] and it's to keep the
[3671.92 - 3675.12] adrenals strong then I'll have some
[3673.64 - 3678.24] steamed potatoes later but it'll keep
[3675.12 - 3680.84] the adrenals strong and it'll also stop
[3678.24 - 3682.48] the adrenals from releasing and that
[3680.84 - 3684.92] lowers the immune system there's so many
[3682.48 - 3688.44] things you can do I mean that's what I
[3684.92 - 3691.36] do right there keeping myself like
[3688.44 - 3693.16] stable so that a I'm not burning the
[3691.36 - 3695.84] gasoline in my body which is your
[3693.16 - 3697.84] adrenaline I'm not burning it all out
[3695.84 - 3700.32] and then I do medical medium recipes
[3697.84 - 3702.60] like medical medium soup recipe with
[3700.32 - 3705.32] there's so many soup recipes and light
[3702.60 - 3707.72] options in the medical medium um books
[3705.32 - 3709.60] that are incredible to help protect you
[3707.72 - 3711.76] if you're not sleeping as much if your
