[0.00 - 4.74] even if someone seems like the most
[2.10 - 8.40] confident person their confidence is
[4.74 - 10.62] over the top even if someone's ego is
[8.40 - 12.66] just way up here they're still
[10.62 - 14.70] soul-searching is there an end to the
[12.66 - 16.26] soul searching and how many lifetimes
[14.70 - 18.24] are we soul-searching people don't
[16.26 - 21.30] realize it but we take all of our
[18.24 - 24.00] experiences all of our knowledge we take
[21.30 - 26.16] it with us when we leave here because
[24.00 - 28.86] the physical brain isn't the only place
[26.16 - 31.26] that harnesses information the neurons
[28.86 - 34.68] and the glial cells isn't the only place
[31.26 - 37.26] that's harboring information the soul is
[34.68 - 40.86] harboring but experiences and
[37.26 - 43.44] information our soul that resides here
[40.86 - 45.42] is harboring information from every
[43.44 - 46.86] single lifetime I hope that no one's
[45.42 - 48.48] offended if I even say that because
[46.86 - 51.48] someone might say no there's only one
[48.48 - 53.64] lifetime that's it I pose a question to
[51.48 - 56.10] you with tremendous respect and no
[53.64 - 58.92] judgment if someone believes it's only a
[56.10 - 61.62] one-time thing we're here we're gone we
[58.92 - 63.66] have no soul everybody has their right
[61.62 - 66.54] to believe in anything they believe in
[63.66 - 69.06] but keep in mind we're in the present
[66.54 - 71.28] time right now how is it possible we're
[69.06 - 73.20] all here on the front line think about
[71.28 - 76.20] that for a minute how is it possible
[73.20 - 78.06] that we are on the front line of time
[76.20 - 79.68] itself right now think about it every
[78.06 - 82.08] minute that clicks forward every second
[79.68 - 84.36] that clicks forward is the front line we
[82.08 - 86.28] are on the front line right now you're
[84.36 - 88.68] not in the past right now 500 years ago
[86.28 - 91.62] you're not in the future 500 years from
[88.68 - 94.68] now you're on the brink The Edge you're
[91.62 - 97.20] on the front line pushing forward into
[94.68 - 99.30] the future second by second by second by
[97.20 - 102.24] second well how did you manage to end up
[99.30 - 104.82] here after billions of years and
[102.24 - 106.32] katrillions of people that have passed
[104.82 - 108.00] and gone their life they died they're
[106.32 - 110.58] gone centuries and centuries of people
[108.00 - 113.46] thousands of years of civilizations how
[110.58 - 115.20] is it possible with all that you think
[113.46 - 116.52] we were just chosen to be on the front
[115.20 - 118.62] line right now
[116.52 - 120.54] at the very second that's pushing
[118.62 - 122.04] forward into time out of all the
[120.54 - 123.90] trillions of people the billions and
[122.04 - 126.06] billions of people and the centuries and
[123.90 - 127.92] the thousands of years Civilizations for
[126.06 - 130.26] some reason were just picked to be on
[127.92 - 133.98] the front line of time aren't we special
[130.26 - 137.28] no it's because we came around again
[133.98 - 139.50] which means we've most likely been here
[137.28 - 141.96] before and before and before our soul
[139.50 - 144.00] carries information you might not be
[141.96 - 146.46] able to tap into it and tap into your
[144.00 - 148.32] soul and the information that you've
[146.46 - 150.12] taken over from Lifetime to lifetime
[148.32 - 152.28] I've learned all this from Spirit of
[150.12 - 155.16] compassion by the way you may not be
[152.28 - 157.80] privy to the information that's passed
[155.16 - 160.92] on over and over and over again meaning
[157.80 - 162.18] into boom another body your soul you
[160.92 - 164.10] live a life you get all these
[162.18 - 166.02] experiences in for information you die
[164.10 - 168.12] your soul contains that spiritual
[166.02 - 170.76] information all that knowledge and you
[168.12 - 173.10] may not be able to tap into it that you
[170.76 - 176.10] think we're all here by chance just by
[173.10 - 178.50] chance with all those people who have
[176.10 - 179.76] been on this plan it alone never mind
[178.50 - 181.14] how many people have been on other
[179.76 - 184.38] planets you think
