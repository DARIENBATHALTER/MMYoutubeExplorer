00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,440
Lyme disease you know and Hashimoto at

even to today but we're going to you

76
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,720
know air that out now lot lot of the

77
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,720
information all the information I'm

78
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:18,040
pulling out is out of my lifechanging

79
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:20,599
Foods book and you guys are going to be

80
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:22,640
so happy when you get this book and so

81
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:25,480
the information's coming out of this

82
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:28,000
book and it's information from Spirit

83
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:31,840
and so what's exciting about this is

84
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,000
that it's not just um the same old stuff

85
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:37,599
it's not stuff that's been circulating

86
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,799
over and over and over again because

87
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:42,480
what happens in the health field is that

88
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:45,200
when information just gets repackaged

89
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,959
and then repackaged with a new bow and

90
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:50,439
then repackaged with a new you know with

91
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:53,200
new paper and new bow and but it's old

92
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:55,640
information and we can't do that anymore

93
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,760
we can't I can't do that I'm never going

94
00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:00,680
to do that I never did I have to give

95
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:03,400
you guys the information that's real

96
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:05,400
that's accurate that's uh that's on the

97
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,480
Forefront that's leading the way that's

98
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,519
pioneering the way because it's the only

99
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,920
way to get you better it's the only only

100
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,799
way to get you better it can't mess

101
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:16,280

210
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,080
the same thing it's the last second

211
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,599
thing last minute if you're one of those

212
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:37,719
people just try to make a note and and

213
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,560
just you know consider consider maybe

214
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:42,919
getting a ticket a little bit

215
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:44,360
earlier um if you can I know life has

216
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:46,320
got you know a lot of crazy stuff going

217
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:48,480
on we're going to do the light blast

218
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:51,080
spirit's going to send light down up

219
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,920
down from heaven and send it down okay

220
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,480
and right on top of everybody's head at

221
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:57,040
the event it's going to rush through

222
00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:00,279
everybody's body it is a rush it is a

223
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:02,640
rush I will say that and um and um as

224
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:04,640
I've always said after that happens

225
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,680
don't operate heavy machinery no

226
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:10,200
bulldozers you know no backos don't hop

227
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:13,720
in any big you know don't navigate a

228
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:15,839
ship right after right after that event

229
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,920
and um you know at least for half an

230
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,200
hour at least after the event because

231
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,399
it's intense when that light goes

232
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,240
through us so um that's happening at the

233
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:27,800
events and uh so I'm I'm looking forward

234
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,680
to that so let's get into health and

235
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:32,200
everything you know I'm to tell you

236
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:34,240
right now when we wake up in the morning

237
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:36,000
right when you wake up in the morning we

238
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,680
got I mean the first thing on my mind is

239
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,000
what does it look like outside you know

240
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:44,640
weather that's kind of on my mind a lot

241
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,720
um you know I maybe maybe younger people

242
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,440
don't think that I I don't know you know

243
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,000
I I felt like when I was younger and

244
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:52,839
know when I was in my teens and when I

245
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,279
was now 10 11 12 13 years old I always

246
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:55,600
wanted to know what the weather was like

247
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:58,920
out there so maybe I'm wrong about that

248
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:01,040
maybe young people um do the same thing

249
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:04,120
but we we you know I I always think

250
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:07,120
what's going on outside when I wake up

251
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:08,880
and that's one thing you know the next

252
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,000
thing is you know so like is it is it a

253
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:14,000
blue sky today what's the weather like

254
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:17,480
is it going to rain is it cloudy um you

255
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,519
know what's going on there uh another

256
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:22,120
thing I think about is is is the if I

257
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:24,240
have to go somewhere is the car okay is

258
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:26,160
the car okay you know is the is the car

259
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:29,320
running okay is it safe does there air

260
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:31,440
in the tires um that kind of gets my

261
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:34,000
mind a little bit another thing too is

262
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,079
did I sleep okay you know did I sleep

263
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
okay um that's something I mean I know

264
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:40,000
you know we we worry about as sleep a

265
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,959
lot of people don't sleep good you know

266
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,079
insomnia everything else we don't sleep

267
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,240
good uh people deal with Epstein bar

268
00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:47,480
issues so they don't sleep good

269
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,440
neurological problems if they don't

270
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,800
sleep good sleep apnea which is by the

271
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,200
way like

272
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,160
neurological uh most sleep apneas are

273
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,880
neurological not just blockages and all

274
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:59,480
that and inflammation but actually

275
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:01,639
neurological um so you know we deal with

276
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:05,040
all these different things with

277
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:07,360
sleep and around sleep so that's

278
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,839
something I I think about too okay did I

279
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:12,920
did I sleep okay I mean with me a lot of

280
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:14,240
times I'll do readings uh on people in

281
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:18,680
the middle of the night that I haven't

282
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:21,079
met yet um which uh has been that's been

283
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:23,480
a difficult thing for years I'll sit up

284
00:11:21,079 --> 00:11:25,600
and I'll actually be doing a reading uh

285
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:27,440
on somebody um in the middle of the

286
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,519
night and then you know I'll meet them

287
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:32,000
and I'll meet them later on so I'll

288
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:35,920
actually meet them either that week or a

289
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,160
year later and um and I you know it's

290
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,519
amazing because spirit's giving the

291
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:40,720
information and I'm talking to the

292
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:42,839
person and I'm giving them information

293
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,639
to heal and helping them heal I have no

294
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:46,519
control over it or when it happens or

295
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:48,600
who it's chosen who is chosen but that's

296
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:52,120
what spirit's been been having me do

297
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:53,800
since I was a child um so I don't always

298
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,560
sleep that great when those those nights

299
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,120
are happening but the point is is these

300
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:59,360
are some of the things that I think

301
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:02,480
about what's going on with the weather

302
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:04,839
outside what's going on with the car I

303
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,040
slept okay great I slept good or you

304
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:09,320
know I had one of those nights where I

305
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:10,639
was doing a reading or you know you know

306
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:13,800
that kind of thing how's my family

307
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:15,279
members you know how are my pets these

308
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,760
are kind of things that I think about

309
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:19,040
are they things things you guys think

310
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:21,839
about at all right when you you get up

311
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:23,320
you start your day and then you know

312
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,600
regardless of our busy lives and

313
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:27,000
everything going out around it and work

314
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,519
and everything else and going around it

315
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,440
these are kind of like those concrete

316
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:35,959
those etched and stone things we kind of

317
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:37,639
think about you know right away or you

318
00:12:35,959 --> 00:12:41,320
know they're part of our lives and then

319
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:43,760
what's the next on the list is food

320
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:47,120
which is probably you know the biggest

321
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:50,720
of all you know what food am I going to

322
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:52,360
eat okay where you know like you know

323
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,120
open up the refrigerator do I have any

324
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:56,160
fruits and vegetables what am I going to

325
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:58,360
eat this morning you know what do I feel

326
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:01,040
like eating can I get a smoothie going

327
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:05,519
you know it's it's like that's all

328
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:08,040
there and but what we don't think about

329
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:10,680
a lot and look some people just grab

330
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:12,720
coffee and piece of toast you know

331
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:16,079
whatever you know some people don't eat

332
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:19,199
anything they just run off and which I

333
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:21,480
don't think is a great idea but the

334
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:25,560
bottom line is what we don't really

335
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:29,680
think about though is the power the

336
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:32,639
power hidden power in our food the

337
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:34,279
hidden Powers the real hidden Powers now

338
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,920
first of all we don't really know about

339
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:40,600
the true hidden Powers the hidden Powers

340
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:42,600
until life-changing Foods is is released

341
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:45,560
and I say that because when you look at

342
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:49,120
it you'll be like oh my God I didn't

343
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:51,680
know that this existed so we're about to

344
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:54,639
learn the true hidden hidden healing

345
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:56,920
powers of our food coming up pretty soon

346
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:59,360
when when when when you know when we get

347
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:01,320
a Cofe in our hands

348
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,000
but other than that we do know food is

349
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,720
medicine it's been told it's medicine

350
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,759
you hypocrates all that it's Med you

351
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:11,959
know the quote you know food is I

352
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:14,040
medicine and we know that and and but we

353
00:14:11,959 --> 00:14:16,199
don't concentrate it on it that much we

354
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:18,720
don't concentrate on it that much we

355
00:14:16,199 --> 00:14:19,839
just eat get fuel in you move on with

356
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,320
your busy

357
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:26,600
day and you know do what we have to do

358
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:29,320
do our chores do our work do our careers

359
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:32,160
and but when you

360
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:33,480
connect to what your food's doing and

361
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,079
what it's really

362
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:39,360
doing and you connect to

363
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:41,639
that it ignites the healing process

364
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,959
because your immune system your

365
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:46,440
emotional state mental state your

366
00:14:43,959 --> 00:14:48,399
physical state attaches itself it it's

367
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:52,720
connected to your soul it connects even

368
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:56,000
more when your soul in your brain and

369
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:58,759
your soul connects to your physical body

370
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,880
and you know what food is doing for you

371
00:14:58,759 --> 00:15:04,279
it's like it makes it even more powerful

372
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:07,160
even more powerful

373
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:08,880
so if you're eating a you know something

374
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:10,800
that's healthy if you eat a carrot or

375
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:13,000
you eat a yam or you eat an apple or you

376
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,720
eat you know whatever it is that you're

377
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,720
eating and you're eating something

378
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,120
healthy it's going to help you it is

379
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,320
going to help you whether you connect

380
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:25,680
with it or not it has medicine it is

381
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:29,959
medicine but when you know what it's

382
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:34,120
doing when you connect that dot

383
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:36,959
that's when even more healing occurs

384
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:40,600
more healing when you know you're eating

385
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:43,639
something and it's knocking down an

386
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:48,279
illness knocking down a condition

387
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:50,880
killing off a virus killing off a bug

388
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:54,160
lowering your

389
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:57,600
inflammation actually making your label

390
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:59,240
for your illness or disease

391
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:03,079
obsolete

392
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:05,399
changes everything it changes everything

393
00:16:03,079 --> 00:16:09,160
so when you're eating something and you

394
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:10,319
know that that food is getting rid of

395
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:12,880
your

396
00:16:10,319 --> 00:16:13,800
label getting rid of the label you've

397
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,639
been

398
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:21,759
handed

399
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:23,759
okay then it changes it it changes

400
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:26,240
incredibly I mean this is critical

401
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:29,279
information that you're about to learn

402
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:31,560
and so this is the power of healing is

403
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:33,120
someone you know a lot more than someone

404
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,759
I've had so many people over the years

405
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,440
well how do you heal what does it take

406
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:38,920
well first of all you have to know

407
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:40,560
what's wrong with you and that's number

408
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:42,399
one and that's what we're always

409
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,720
bringing to the table here at the show

410
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:46,120
is finally for the first time connecting

411
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,360
the dots to the symptoms to what's

412
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:50,920
really causing it and that's only been

413
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:53,199
happening here only been happening here

414
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:56,040
I say that once again just so you don't

415
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:57,720
end up somewhere else getting you know

416
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:59,279
misinformation and because it's not

417
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,839
going to help you want you want

418
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:03,480
information that's that's actually going

419
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:05,160
to help you heal and what happens is

420
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:08,319
that when you know what's wrong that's

421
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:10,240
half the battle knowing what to do is

422
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:12,880
the other half and part of knowing what

423
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:15,760
to do is knowing what your food's doing

424
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:19,280
for you knowing what your food is doing

425
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:23,319
for you for the first time in your life

426
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:25,079
for the first time it changes

427
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:27,520
everything

428
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:30,720
so let's talk about that a little bit

429
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:33,400
let's talk about herb and spices and the

430
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:38,160
power they have for

431
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:40,799
healing so lemon bomb you guys lemon

432
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,520
bomb lemon bomb Melissa that's you know

433
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:45,600
the herb some people have it growing in

434
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:47,720
the garden you can get lemon bomb tea

435
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,720
you can get fresh lemon bomb out of the

436
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:52,559
garden if you have lemon bomb growing in

437
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:54,919
your garden a lot of people don't that's

438
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:57,480
not something everybody has or growing

439
00:17:54,919 --> 00:18:00,880
in a pot on the back patio or or

440
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:05,360
somewhere but you can get dried lemon

441
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:07,840
bomb and lemon bomb is really powerful

442
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:11,000
for healing because one of the problems

443
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:15,000
that we have is neurotoxins

444
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:19,280
neurotoxins you know mold causes a Mot

445
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,840
toxin that's not as bad as a neurotoxin

446
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,360
neurotoxins you know what happens

447
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:25,960
there's this debate out there right now

448
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:28,840
they think they think mot toxin is a is

449
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:31,280
neurotoxic um actually no it just it

450
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:33,280
just it's immunotoxic so it it drops

451
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,200
your immune system down it lowers your

452
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:38,679
immune system down so mot toxin comes

453
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:42,159
from mold mold knocks your immune system

454
00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:46,159
down so that another problem can take

455
00:18:42,159 --> 00:18:48,240
over which is viruses that create

456
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:49,480
neurotoxins okay if I'm going too fast

457
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,400
because I'm talking fast today because

458
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:53,919
we got a lot to cover then just you got

459
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:55,720
to go back to the archive and and take

460
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:58,559
more notes because we're going to talk

461
00:18:55,720 --> 00:19:01,799
about a lot of stuff here and you know

462
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:04,240
and uh get you know sit back relax at

463
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:06,520
the same time put your seat belt on too

464
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,480
and so you know here's here's the deal

465
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:11,520
so the neurotoxins that are produced by

466
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:14,360
viruses such as Epstein bar or the

467
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:18,919
shingles or you know

468
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:21,760
simplexes or hhv 6s hhv 7s and

469
00:19:18,919 --> 00:19:22,960
undiscovered hhv 10s and 11s and 12s

470
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,240
that science doesn't even have their

471
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,600
finger on that cause kidney damage and

472
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:28,559
all kinds of other things we're we're

473
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:32,039
light years from that information coming

474
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:34,600
out and um so all these neurotoxins that

475
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:37,480
we deal with they give us Tangles and

476
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:40,679
numbness that gives us you know feelings

477
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:43,039
of of of brain fog light-headedness

478
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:45,360
balance issues vertigo

479
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:48,760
issues okay all these neurotoxins that

480
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:49,960
cause tentis neurological symptoms Lyme

481
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:52,400
disease symptoms these are all

482
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:54,720
neurotoxins they're not bacteria they're

483
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:57,480
all from the viral

484
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:59,720
Family well these neurotoxins inflame

485
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:02,840
nerves like the frenic nerves nerves

486
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:04,039
that run through the chest frenic you

487
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:06,679
know that's that goes you know it's

488
00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:07,960
connected to the word frantic anxiety

489
00:20:06,679 --> 00:20:09,520
nerves the ones that run through the

490
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:11,520
chest anxiety when you have anxiety you

491
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,960
have tightness of the chest like you

492
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:15,559
need get the tightness of the chest and

493
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:19,280
tightness in there tightness of the

494
00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:20,919
throat and you feel funny in the head

495
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:23,039
then that's the anxiety those are the

496
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:25,520
anxiety nerves the frenic nerves

497
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:28,400
neurotoxins tend to tighten those up get

498
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:30,960
them inflamed same thing with the Vagas

499
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:33,000
nerve and these neurotoxins from Epstein

500
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:35,280
bar and shingles cause the Vegas nerve

501
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,799
to get inflamed

502
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:40,240
and we first of all the information is

503
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:42,640
doesn't even exist out there about what

504
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:45,919
I just told you except uh in the medical

505
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:47,559
medium book um and in the podcast that

506
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:49,159
when I talk about this stuff in the end

507
00:20:47,559 --> 00:20:52,679
of the neurological episode and

508
00:20:49,159 --> 00:20:54,840
everything else so um first of all

509
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:57,799
that's you know that's what's happening

510
00:20:54,840 --> 00:21:01,559
there but second of all knowing what to

511
00:20:57,799 --> 00:21:03,640
do for it is another thing meaning

512
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:06,640
knowing foods that help and herbs and

513
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:09,640
spices lemon balm helps with this

514
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:13,080
condition it helps when you have this

515
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:14,840
lemon balb is antiviral it's

516
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:17,400
antibacterial too and we're going to

517
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:20,880
talk about that but it's antiviral

518
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:23,240
against the viruses like hhv6 and

519
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,880
Epstein bar against the viruses and and

520
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:27,760
different kinds of herpes viruses that

521
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,039
we have that cause neurotoxins that

522
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,559
cause all these symptoms that are

523
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:32,320
mysterious that are Unknown by even the

524
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:33,559
lime doctors by even all everybody else

525
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,799
that doesn't know what connects these

526
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:38,640
dots to these symptoms so lemon bomb is

527
00:21:35,799 --> 00:21:42,039
that powerful now if you're someone with

528
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:44,640
UTI and you get UTI bladder infections

529
00:21:42,039 --> 00:21:48,120
kidney infections

530
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:49,360
tonsilitis um those are all from strep

531
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:52,320
strep a

532
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:54,720
cacus so

533
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:58,520
laryngitis um

534
00:21:54,720 --> 00:22:00,559
cystitis yeast infections urin Ary tract

535
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:03,520
infections these are all from strep and

536
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:07,000
lemon balm is a strep killer if you're

537
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:09,039
someone that has hpylori if you were

538
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,120

lemon bomb tea consistently in your diet

00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:16,919
every single day so what I'm saying is

541
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,679
no when I wake up in the morning I'm

542
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:20,799
like okay what's the weather like it's

causes anything out there but we put

737
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:02,240
these labels on them and we're just not

738
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:03,880

747
00:30:18,679 --> 00:30:22,600

thyroiditis uh okay that's what it is

749
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:30,240
ryal syndrome but what's causing it ryal

750
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:32,919
syndrome is a reaction from having blood

751
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:37,080
toxicity from having a lot of Epstein

752
00:30:32,919 --> 00:30:39,840
bar virus in the liver itself producing

753
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:41,559
byproduct lots of toxins and it filling

754
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,200
the bloodstream and it not leaving the

755
00:30:41,559 --> 00:30:45,360
bloodstream and it discolor Ates the

756
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,000
skin cause the purple purple feet purple

757
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:50,320
hands all that kind of stuff the blotchy

758
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:52,240
hands all that so Ginger's incredible

759
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:54,080
for that incredible for radiation

760
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:57,399
exposure you've been to the dentist you

761
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:59,080
gotten too many of those those x-rays

762
00:30:57,399 --> 00:31:01,720
okay before they were even digital the

763
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:03,080
radiation is still in you from years ago

764
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:04,919
before they were even digital where

765
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:08,399
there was less

766
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:09,840
radiation so let's do something about it

767
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:13,120
let's make sure Ginger's in there all

768
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:14,760
the time right thyroid cancer Ginger's

769
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,120
incredible for thyroid cancer for the

770
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:17,480
variety of epsteen bar that creates

771
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,279
thyroid cancer you're only going to hear

772
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,880
that

773
00:31:18,279 --> 00:31:23,720
here

774
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:26,399
and yeah the spirit taught me a long

775
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:27,679
time ago and I've been helping people

776
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:29,240
and telling them well that it's caused

777
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:30,480
by your Epstein bar so let's do

778
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:32,919
something about the Epstein bar and

779
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:37,080
that's what creates thyroid cancer

780
00:31:32,919 --> 00:31:42,320
pancreatic cancer celiac disease celiac

781
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:44,840
disease Celiac is is a pathogen feeding

782
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:46,559
off of a food creating inflammation it's

783
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:48,720
not your body attacking itself once

784
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:52,240
again the autoimmune tag that we address

785
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:54,679
all the time and and try to you know get

786
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:58,480
you to understand and get everybody to

787
00:31:54,679 --> 00:32:01,240
understand and and and I I self think

788
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:03,679
about it all the time because it blows

789
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:05,559
my mind that we've been told our body's

790
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:08,200
attacking itself when it's not that just

791
00:32:05,559 --> 00:32:10,039
blows my mind that we're told that so

792
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:12,039
all of us have to get on board with with

793
00:32:10,039 --> 00:32:13,559
with that you know that misleading

794
00:32:12,039 --> 00:32:15,360
information and get that right it's

795
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:17,080
going to help us heal it's about helping

796
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:19,200

00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:39,840
couldn't like say something to somebody

830
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:43,120
or you just couldn't get it out at work

831
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:45,840
or anywhere in your life and you felt

832
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:47,559
like you're being kind of held back I if

833
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:50,159
you've ever felt that I I felt like that

834
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:52,200
as a child um in a lot of ways because I

835
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:54,720
couldn't tell everyone the information

836
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:56,320
that Spirit had but we all get a touch

837
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:58,519
of that right that we just can't feel

838
00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:00,720
like we can't use also our intu of

839
00:33:58,519 --> 00:34:03,039
abilities and we can't you know say it

840
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:06,000
like it is sometimes I mean of course

841
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:10,159
when at the right moments and all that

842
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:11,839
well Ginger helps remedy this it really

843
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:15,399
does what when you have ginger in your

844
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:18,240
life every day it is

845
00:34:15,399 --> 00:34:20,520
responsible for getting an emotional

846
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:22,760
state in the body rewired the part that

847
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:24,520
we get kind of stifled that we get held

848
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,679
back to what we want to say and when

849
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:27,800
Ginger is in your life you'd be

850
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:31,079
surprised all of a sudden you can say

851
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:32,760
what you need to say I mean not a

852
00:34:31,079 --> 00:34:34,520
hurtful thing or anything else like that

853
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:36,800
just things that are important that we

854
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:40,079
feel like we can't say to someone or

855
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:44,079
some somebody or even to

856
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:46,720
ourselves so Ginger is it unlocks that

857
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:48,720
door it unlocks that door to when we

858
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:50,480
feel like hey you know we're feeling

859
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:53,280

stifled and you know there's a beautiful

861
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,079
thing that happens with ginger and that

862
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:58,200

863
00:34:56,079 --> 00:35:00,160

phytochemicals that run on the same

884
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:53,280
frequency as harmful

885
00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:55,359

know worms really aren't the parasitical

889
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:06,280
family worms are worms worms are the

890
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:07,400
worm family that has to be separated

891
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:09,839
that's that that's not in the

892
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:12,599
parasitical family even though they they

893
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:14,000
they put those in no worms are worms

894
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:15,599
that's a different whole family than

895
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,440
parasites different whole family than

896
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:18,319
mold different whole family than viruses

00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:21,760
and

898
00:36:18,319 --> 00:36:23,960
bacteria but there's a frequency that

899
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:27,119
these bugs run on a frequency that

900
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:31,880
Epstein bar runs on there's a frequency

901
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:34,400
that bacteria like staff and merca run

902
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:38,000
on these are there's an actual

903
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:41,000
frequency garlic runs on the same

904
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:43,000
frequency it does now you think that

905
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,359
would be bad well does that mean garlic

906
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:49,800

bad no no no no no no garlic runs on the

908
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:55,040
same frequency which makes it even more

909
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:57,839
powerful the phytochemicals that are in

910
00:36:55,040 --> 00:37:01,319
garlic are Act extra antiviral

911
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:04,760
antibacterial antifungal antimold anti-

912
00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:08,040
parasitical anti-worm they're extra

913
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:11,319
powerful because they trick out the

914
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:14,200
bugs they trick out the bugs the bugs

915
00:37:11,319 --> 00:37:17,800
are protected in our bodies they have

916
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:20,480
little walls around them they Harbor in

917
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:24,040
places that are toxic in our body they

918
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:26,319
have they have protection methods you've

919
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:28,240
heard of bofilm well there's a part of

920
00:37:26,319 --> 00:37:29,440
the bofilm information is correct most

921
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:32,040
of it's just wrong and needs to be

922
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:35,000
thrown away but bofilm is basically

923
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:36,599
byproduct byproduct produced by bugs and

924
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,040
these bugs hide in that the

925
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:42,280
phytochemical and garlic breaks in there

926
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:44,319
because they think it's one of them the

927
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:46,560
phytochemical runs on the same frequency

928
00:37:44,319 --> 00:37:49,000
as the bugs the bugs let it through the

929
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:51,760
door they let it in the

930
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:55,560
door that's what

931
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:59,040
happens it's basically like a whole gang

932
00:37:55,560 --> 00:38:02,000
a whole gang of B bad guys sitting in a

933
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:03,119
little private Hideway and a knock on

934
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,720
the door

935
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:08,560
occurs and they're like who is this and

936
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:11,400
the garlic phytochemicals are like I'm

937
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:13,480
one of you let me in so the bad guys

938
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:15,720
look at each other and don't think it's

939
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:17,200
the police at all they don't think it's

940
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:19,440
the police at all they look at each

941
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:22,000
other and they say because they feel the

942
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:24,760
frequency the frequency of garlic

943
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,599
phytochemicals it's their frequency said

944
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:28,680
like you know what this is one of us

945
00:38:26,599 --> 00:38:31,200
they open the door and they let it in

946
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:33,119
and the garlic rips them apart the

947
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:35,839
phytochemicals rip them apart and that's

948
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:39,920
the power of garlic okay just in a

949
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:41,960
nutshell this is some of what it does um

950
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:43,800
so as far as conditions and everything

951
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:45,760
else around it with garlic I mean you

952
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:48,280
can you can you can go to town with this

953
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:50,760
it's crazy um you know it helps the

954
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:53,280
lymphatic system it kills harmful

955
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:56,319
bacteria everywhere staff you know

956
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:59,280
hpylori annihilates H pylori now here's

957
00:38:56,319 --> 00:39:03,560
the thing to understand about garlic

958
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:06,599
garlic does not kill good bacteria this

959
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:08,480
is a mistake in alternative medicine and

960
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:10,920
conventional medicine right now out

961
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:12,319
there don't fall for that mistake if you

962
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:15,079
eat garlic it's going to kill all your

963
00:39:12,319 --> 00:39:17,880
bad bacteria I mean all your good

964
00:39:15,079 --> 00:39:20,079
bacteria sorry about that if you eat

965
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:22,319
garlic it's going to kill all your good

966
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:24,760
bacteria that's a mistake that's not

967
00:39:22,319 --> 00:39:28,079
right that's misleading garlic kills all

968
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:29,640
the bad bacteria that's what it does so

969
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:33,079
this is really important to understand

970
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:35,800
don't forget this one um so it it it

971
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:38,079
rips apart H by Lori it does things like

972
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:40,440
protects us from esophageal cancer so

973
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:41,760
esophagus cancer of esophagus prostate

974
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:44,119
cancer so if you're worried about

975
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:46,119
prostate cancer and your you know your

976
00:39:44,119 --> 00:39:48,000
uncle your husband your friend whatever

977
00:39:46,119 --> 00:39:49,680
and you're worried about you that

978
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,520
happening make sure there's garlic in

979
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:54,560
the diet in any way you can possibly do

980
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:57,200
it people with Lyme disease that have

981
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:59,640
neurological symptoms from V viruses not

982
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:02,319
from bacteria you want to use garlic it

983
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:03,800
kills off all the different viral

984
00:40:02,319 --> 00:40:05,920
properties all the different viral

985
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:07,760
bodies of Epstein bar and shingles and

986
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:10,040
all these different hhv6 all these

987
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:12,160
different viruses and CMV that stand in

988
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:14,400
the way of lime that are in there in

989
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:15,599
Lime so we want to make sure we knock

990
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,680
those out and if you're one of those

991
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:21,000
that believes in Bartonella being the

992
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:22,960
problem of lime or babesia or bellia

993
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,560
then garlic kills off those no problem

994
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:28,119
in fact it really kills those off easy

995
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:29,480
at one shot a few meals of garlic and

996
00:40:28,119 --> 00:40:33,119
and right through the bloodstream those

997
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:35,319
bugs just die so that's the power garlic

998
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:36,400
has so we have to start using it like

999
00:40:35,319 --> 00:40:40,119
that it's a

1000
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:43,040
medicine and emotional support let's

1001
00:40:40,119 --> 00:40:45,200
talk about the emotional support I mean

1002
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:47,400
were you ever at a fragile Point are you

1003
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:49,560

1004
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:53,200
fragile point in in many times in my

1005
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:57,079
life you know I'm I'm I've been there

1006
00:40:53,200 --> 00:41:00,319
you know I know and spirit told me

1007
00:40:57,079 --> 00:41:01,720
to bring garlic into my life it made me

1008
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:05,000
less

1009
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:07,160
fragile and it made me feel stronger at

1010
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,000
times in my life when I was younger and

1011
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:10,839
different times you know in our being

1012
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:14,599
when we feel a little bit of little bit

1013
00:41:10,839 --> 00:41:17,280
of that fra fragileness you know

1014
00:41:14,599 --> 00:41:18,800
and so you know when we feel like we

1015
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,960
just need a little extra shelter a

1016
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:23,480
little extra protection lot going on in

1017
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:25,440
life I mean if you're ever feeling this

1018
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:28,880
way make sure you have some garlic in

1019
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:32,880
here because it helps change that it

1020
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:34,760
does help change that so let's knock

1021
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:37,280
these out we got to keep on going

1022
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:40,400

because I want you using cilantro every

1026
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:54,599
day it pulls out the the heavy metals

1027
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:56,240
detoxifies the heavy metals but I'm

1028
00:41:54,599 --> 00:41:58,560
going to give you some information

1029
00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:01,720
that's mind-blowing about that because

1030
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:04,760
we know that out there I actually I I'm

1031
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:07,119
not responsible for cilantro being you

1032
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:10,240

1033
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:13,240
detoxifier that part isn't mine I knew

1034
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:15,040
about it from Spirit since day one but

1035
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:17,040
um but I didn't spread that information

1036
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:18,920
out there in time you know so that that

1037
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:20,760
was out there and it's incredible

1038
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:23,280
information that's that's when we have

1039
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:24,720
to pick our gems and jewels in the

1040
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:26,760
information that's out there flying

1041
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:28,880
amongst misinformation and

1042
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:30,880
misconceptions and fads and Trends we

1043
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:33,319
have to grab our jewels and we have to

1044
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:35,880
pick those out and leave the rest take

1045
00:42:33,319 --> 00:42:38,319
what you can and leave the rest and

1046
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:42,319
cilantro being heavy metal detoxifier

1047
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:44,640
yes take that one in from the outside

1048
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:47,680
but let me give you some of the inside

1049
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:49,839
that's not out there it's the living

1050
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:53,119
water in fresh

1051
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:54,400
cilantro the living water in its stems

1052
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:59,040
and

1053
00:42:54,400 --> 00:43:02,880
leaves that have the ability to take

1054
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:06,000
phytochemicals through the blood brain

1055
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:08,000
barrier and to take the phytochemicals

1056
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:11,040
through the bloodstream because the

1057
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:13,720
living water in cilantro is comprised of

1058
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:20,119
sodium pottassium and

1059
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:20,119
chloride okay these Bond onto potent

1060
00:43:20,599 --> 00:43:26,480
phytochemicals okay and they travel in

1061
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:29,160
our Highway in our body in our

1062
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:32,040
bloodstream are precious mineral salt

1063
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:34,640
highway so they combine themselves they

1064
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:36,319
get into the stream into the stream of

1065
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:40,359
the precious mineral salt Highway that

1066
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:42,160
keeps us alive that gets up to our brain

1067
00:43:40,359 --> 00:43:45,319
this precious mineral salt Highway that

1068
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:47,720
gets up through our spinal cord it gets

1069
00:43:45,319 --> 00:43:51,480
into that blood brain

1070
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:54,400
barrier and cilantro Living

1071
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:56,160
Water okay with with which is comprised

1072
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:59,359
of these minerals of chloride potassium

1073
00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:02,720
sodium bind on to the

1074
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:05,079
phytochemicals in cilantro take it into

1075
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:07,160
the stream in the highway of our

1076
00:44:05,079 --> 00:44:09,839
precious mineral salt Highway that goes

1077
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:11,559
up to our bloodstream lymph fluid and

1078
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:12,720
then finally spinal flute and then up

1079
00:44:11,559 --> 00:44:14,880
into the

1080
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:17,760
brain and

1081
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:21,119
then they combine with Glycine and

1082
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:24,319
glutamine amino acids that help make

1083
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:26,720
them even more powerful for extracting

1084
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:28,559
toxic heavy metals out of the body

1085
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:30,880
hopefully I didn't run that by so quick

1086
00:44:28,559 --> 00:44:32,359
because I'm like you know I'm talking

1087
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:34,920
like like really quick right now because

1088
00:44:32,359 --> 00:44:38,480

1267
00:52:11,559 --> 00:52:15,680

1268
00:52:13,319 --> 00:52:18,640

00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:22,760
making light and fluffy scrambled eggs

1271
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:24,280
for everybody you know and I I figured

1272
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:26,839
let me have an egg Shack where everybody

1273
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:28,280
can come in and it's like a shack and

1274
00:52:26,839 --> 00:52:29,920
we're cooking eggs in there and frying

1275
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:31,400
eggs in there and people like them

1276
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:33,559
Sunnyside up and they like them

1277
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:35,720
hard-boiled and they like them poached

1278
00:52:33,559 --> 00:52:37,400
and they like omelets and eggs make

1279
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:40,160
people happy and I totally understand it

1280
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:43,040
was my dream to do that when I was 8

1281
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:47,079
nine 10 years old I loved cooking them

1282
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:48,280
up and spirit said you can't do it and I

1283
00:52:47,079 --> 00:52:49,920
said what do you mean I can't do it

1284
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:52,440
spirit says you're going to be helping

1285
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:54,079

1286
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:56,319

1293
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:14,720
said I can't believe I have to care and

1294
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:16,240

1295
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:18,240
