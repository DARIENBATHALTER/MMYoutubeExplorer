[1.64 - 7.26] supplements that are bad for your brain
[4.68 - 8.34] supplementation that's bad for the brain
[7.26 - 10.86] so that's what we're talking about we're
[8.34 - 12.90] in the brain saver books you guys I'm so
[10.86 - 15.60] blown away right now because these books
[12.90 - 18.48] are in your hands it's absolutely
[15.60 - 20.46] incredible on all kinds of levels
[18.48 - 22.50] the brain shot therapy so you guys doing
[20.46 - 24.66] the brain shot therapies do you feel it
[22.50 - 25.86] it's relief it's like
[24.66 - 29.58] I'm just going to tell you right now
[25.86 - 32.28] sometimes I mean they they just like hit
[29.58 - 33.66] you like whoa like it's crazy you guys
[32.28 - 36.18] I'm excited about this because I'm
[33.66 - 38.04] talking about supplementation inside the
[36.18 - 39.60] brain saver protocols book right here
[38.04 - 42.60] now there's two books brainsaver brain
[39.60 - 45.66] saver protocols 40 off which is utterly
[42.60 - 48.42] insane these are massive books heavy
[45.66 - 51.54] tons of information can't say enough
[48.42 - 53.40] about them but 40 off amazon.com right
[51.54 - 55.32] now take advantage of the sale for gifts
[53.40 - 56.82] and for whatever holidays and everything
[55.32 - 58.80] else I'm telling my friends that's what
[56.82 - 60.42] you should do it's a really good chance
[58.80 - 62.22] right now for that now I'm just reading
[60.42 - 64.08] a little bit in here so this is really
[62.22 - 65.28] an exciting moment for me because I'm in
[64.08 - 67.80] a section
[65.28 - 71.04] talking about supplementation that's bad
[67.80 - 73.08] for the brain right so brain betrayer
[71.04 - 75.42] supplements is what I call them they're
[73.08 - 78.48] in the brain saver protocols cleanses
[75.42 - 79.56] and healed uh and and recipes right so
[78.48 - 81.84] here we go
[79.56 - 83.22] these supplements fall into four main
[81.84 - 85.76] categories so I'm going to take these
[83.22 - 85.76] off right now
[89.64 - 94.98] so these supplements fall into four main
[91.80 - 96.72] categories let me read the categories to
[94.98 - 99.30] you I'm so excited I'm going too fast
[96.72 - 100.98] right here it's problematic and damaging
[99.30 - 102.44] supplements that's the category we're
[100.98 - 106.02] working in right now
[102.44 - 108.54] problematic and damaging supplements so
[106.02 - 111.84] that's the category then there's mildly
[108.54 - 113.58] mildly problematic supplements it's
[111.84 - 116.70] another category
[113.58 - 118.92] and then overrated or overused
[116.70 - 121.08] supplements another category and then
[118.92 - 123.06] quality concerns supplements where it's
[121.08 - 124.80] especially important to seek out high
[123.06 - 127.02] quality forms because they're frequently
[124.80 - 128.70] produced with low quality ingredients or
[127.02 - 130.26] problematic additives such as
[128.70 - 132.90] preservatives
[130.26 - 134.52] so earlier today we were talking about a
[132.90 - 136.20] few of them so I'm just going to list
[134.52 - 137.64] out a few there's alkaline ionized or
[136.20 - 139.14] water machines there's apple cider
[137.64 - 141.78] vinegar products they're spent tonight
[139.14 - 144.36] clay there's caffeine based supplements
[141.78 - 146.52] there's charcoal there's chlorella
[144.36 - 148.20] there's chlorine dioxide there's cod
[146.52 - 151.16] liver oil shark liver oil there's
[148.20 - 153.80] colostrum deer antler diatomaceous earth
[151.16 - 156.66] does any of this ring a bell at all
[153.80 - 157.98] digestive bitters essential oils taken
[156.66 - 161.64] internally
[157.98 - 164.22] fat burners fish oil and krill oil gut
[161.64 - 166.82] powder Blends herbal tinctures and
[164.22 - 170.34] alcohol hydrochloric acid HCL
[166.82 - 173.64] supplements L-Carnitine L-Arginine
[170.34 - 177.12] mineral oil mushroom coffee with
[173.64 - 180.84] caffeine oyster supplements Pearl powder
[177.12 - 183.06] sodium bicarbonate turpentine oil whey
[180.84 - 184.62] protein powder zeolites does any of that
[183.06 - 188.04] ring a bell at all you guys because
[184.62 - 190.26] those are all problematic and damaging
[188.04 - 192.00] supplements to the brain I'm going to
[190.26 - 194.46] read a little on some of those right
[192.00 - 196.98] there so I don't know if you guys have
[194.46 - 198.36] taken those throughout your time or a
[196.98 - 200.10] lot of people try everything they've
[198.36 - 202.32] been there they've done that they've
[200.10 - 204.42] tried so many different things so let's
[202.32 - 205.80] hit it a little bit in some areas a
[204.42 - 207.00] couple of areas where I didn't talk
[205.80 - 209.58] about yet
[207.00 - 211.26] let's hit zeolite I think that's a good
[209.58 - 212.82] area right there so let's take it from
[211.26 - 216.30] there okay
[212.82 - 219.96] in recent years in edible varieties of
[216.30 - 222.30] zeolites have been Unearthed and
[219.96 - 224.40] manufactured in the same places as
[222.30 - 225.60] edible zeolites so just digest that for
[224.40 - 228.36] a second
[225.60 - 229.20] just kind of grab on to that for a
[228.36 - 231.78] moment
[229.20 - 235.50] in recent years in edible varieties of
[231.78 - 237.54] zeolites have been Unearthed and
[235.50 - 239.70] manufactured in the same places as
[237.54 - 242.52] edible zeolites just kind of grasp back
[239.70 - 244.62] for a second very important causing
[242.52 - 246.66] cross-contamination
[244.62 - 249.00] so when you're doing zealots you can be
[246.66 - 251.04] really understanding about how it works
[249.00 - 253.32] and what's going on okay so I'm in the
[251.04 - 255.30] brain saver books if you guys don't have
[253.32 - 257.34] these you're missing out I don't even
[255.30 - 260.64] know what to say greatest books of all
[257.34 - 263.42] time hands down in health
[260.64 - 267.12] you will see okay so let's keep on going
[263.42 - 269.16] neither edible nor inedible zeolites
[267.12 - 271.14] cross the blood-brain barrier so let's
[269.16 - 273.42] just digest that for a second
[271.14 - 275.88] if you hear zeolites cross a blood brain
[273.42 - 277.62] Berry you're being scammed
[275.88 - 279.24] there's no science or research that can
[277.62 - 281.64] ever show that is the lights across the
[279.24 - 283.80] blood-brain barrier it doesn't exist
[281.64 - 285.54] so if you hear that so you hear all the
[283.80 - 287.10] zeolite reps it's like oh crosses the
[285.54 - 288.06] blood brain period oh really because it
[287.10 - 290.94] doesn't
[288.06 - 293.22] really important to know neither edible
[290.94 - 295.74] nor inedible zeolites cross the
[293.22 - 297.44] blood-brain barrier nor do they enter
[295.74 - 302.06] the brain
[297.44 - 305.52] zeolite cannot enter the brain another
[302.06 - 307.98] complete misunderstanding in the scam
[305.52 - 310.26] world of zeolites really important so
[307.98 - 311.76] these are these are life-changing books
[310.26 - 313.20] because you really become empowered
[311.76 - 315.06] because you understand what's really
[313.20 - 317.78] happening so you can protect yourself
[315.06 - 319.98] and your brain
[317.78 - 321.90] cross-contaminated zeolite varieties
[319.98 - 323.54] stay in the intestinal tract and
[321.90 - 326.46] irritate the lining
[323.54 - 328.38] cross-contaminated zeolites which is all
[326.46 - 330.48] of them
[328.38 - 332.58] stay in the intestinal tract and
[330.48 - 334.98] irritate the lining
[332.58 - 336.36] causing dehydration and vagus nerve
[334.98 - 338.76] sensitivities now we have to protect our
[336.36 - 340.98] vagus nerves it's critical that we
[338.76 - 343.08] understand our vagus nerves and protect
[340.98 - 345.42] our vagus nerves coming out of a brain
[343.08 - 348.00] stem our vagus nerves have a lot to do
[345.42 - 350.10] with so many aspects of our internal
[348.00 - 351.78] health here I've talked about that a lot
[350.10 - 354.84] of times but the books are packed with
[351.78 - 356.22] Vegas Urban for information loaded with
[354.84 - 358.02] vagus nerves
[356.22 - 360.06] and their information about them so
[358.02 - 362.10] let's go a little bit further
[360.06 - 363.66] so what happens is zeolites irritate the
[362.10 - 365.28] intestinal lining
[363.66 - 367.82] causing
[365.28 - 367.82] nerve problem
[367.98 - 371.88] your zeolite and you're literally
[369.42 - 373.80] creating vagus nerve issues that means
[371.88 - 374.90] anxiety that means all kinds of other
[373.80 - 378.30] issues
[374.90 - 380.34] ticks and spasms anxiety weird digestion
[378.30 - 382.44] stuff stomach stuff gastroparesis
[380.34 - 383.82] whatever a whole bunch of things that
[382.44 - 386.46] medical medium information talks about
[383.82 - 389.66] vagus nerve can be involved with okay
[386.46 - 392.94] let's go a little bit further
[389.66 - 396.12] edible zeolites which is do you like
[392.94 - 398.76] products right edible zeolites even if
[396.12 - 401.16] you have every assurance that they're
[398.76 - 403.20] not cross-contaminated should not be
[401.16 - 405.96] taken in high dosages or long term
[403.20 - 408.18] because even edible zeolites they're
[405.96 - 410.64] varieties of zeolites build up inside
[408.18 - 412.62] the gut creating imbalances and
[410.64 - 415.02] dehydration
[412.62 - 417.24] which takes critical electrolytes and
[415.02 - 419.28] water from the brain
[417.24 - 421.62] it's even a really good feel like you're
[419.28 - 424.32] taking a decent amount of it you're
[421.62 - 427.04] stealing hydration from neurons and
[424.32 - 427.04] brain tissue
[427.52 - 433.26] large dosages of zeolite can create
[430.32 - 435.48] Trace mineral imbalance because zeolites
[433.26 - 438.48] don't have a discernment between get
[435.48 - 441.12] ready for this oh my God
[438.48 - 441.90] that's every line in this book is like
[441.12 - 444.72] this
[441.90 - 447.60] every line in these both these books is
[444.72 - 450.00] exactly where it's mind-blown mind blown
[447.60 - 451.26] it's one line after another check this
[450.00 - 453.72] out
[451.26 - 455.76] large dosages of zeolites can create a
[453.72 - 460.50] trace mineral imbalance
[455.76 - 463.92] get ready because zeolites don't have a
[460.50 - 464.82] discernment between what's a toxic heavy
[463.92 - 467.34] metal
[464.82 - 469.08] get ready and what's a precious Trace
[467.34 - 470.66] mineral the very thing we need in our
[469.08 - 472.44] brain the very thing we need
[470.66 - 474.06] neurotransmitter chemicals need
[472.44 - 475.56] everything needs in the brain I talk
[474.06 - 478.86] about it in the brain saver books
[475.56 - 481.20] zeolite does not have a discernment
[478.86 - 483.24] between trace minerals that are precious
[481.20 - 484.38] for our brain in toxic heavy metals you
[483.24 - 487.68] know what that means
[484.38 - 489.54] when you take zeolites they they can
[487.68 - 493.22] actually cage up
[489.54 - 493.22] trace minerals and they do
[494.48 - 499.58] zeolites do not travel into the
[496.44 - 502.74] bloodstream so let's make this clear too
[499.58 - 504.54] zeolites don't travel into the
[502.74 - 506.28] bloodstream they stay in the intestinal
[504.54 - 510.24] tract so it's another thing people just
[506.28 - 512.10] get tricked by the holes of light talk
[510.24 - 513.72] zeolites do not travel into the
[512.10 - 516.12] bloodstream
[513.72 - 518.16] and they do not bind onto toxic heavy
[516.12 - 521.82] metals in the bloodstream critical to no
[518.16 - 524.82] zeolites are not a reliable binder so I
[521.82 - 526.38] love I love what I hear out there at
[524.82 - 529.08] Albanian doesn't know anything about
[526.38 - 533.04] binders what
[529.08 - 534.72] I don't yeah you need to like oh you do
[533.04 - 536.28] okay
[534.72 - 539.10] keep on telling a whole bunch of people
[536.28 - 541.14] that get them sicker chronically ill
[539.10 - 542.94] just you know it's like you guys are one
[541.14 - 544.32] big experiment out there
[542.94 - 547.02] I've said that before the chronically
[544.32 - 549.06] ill are just one big experiment for a
[547.02 - 552.24] whole bunch of
[549.06 - 553.86] not so smart people that tries to just
[552.24 - 555.24] like do this do this it's like and then
[553.86 - 557.28] the chronically ill who are really smart
[555.24 - 558.96] they're just like they're just this one
[557.28 - 561.36] big experiment
[558.96 - 563.70] zeolites are not a reliable binder
[561.36 - 565.68] zeolites only stay in the intestinal
[563.70 - 567.24] tract just like clay it's just like clay
[565.68 - 568.50] it stays in the intestinal tract it
[567.24 - 570.18] doesn't go to your brain doesn't cross
[568.50 - 572.52] the blood brain barrier and it doesn't
[570.18 - 574.98] go into your bloodstream
[572.52 - 577.80] as Elites sit inside the intestinal
[574.98 - 579.66] tract they can interrupt trace minerals
[577.80 - 580.86] from leaving the intestinal tract and
[579.66 - 583.08] entering the liver so your trace
[580.86 - 585.90] minerals that enter your body have to go
[583.08 - 588.84] into your liver and brain with the
[585.90 - 592.08] zeolite can stop that
[588.84 - 593.76] so I think where people get confused
[592.08 - 595.92] because at one point you recommended
[593.76 - 597.00] them I understand why you do not now but
[595.92 - 599.34] people
[597.00 - 600.90] that haven't updated themselves on your
[599.34 - 602.64] new information
[600.90 - 603.90] well here's the thing and it's not even
[602.64 - 606.30] just that
[603.90 - 609.78] what it is is
[606.30 - 611.46] there's a whole bunch of sharks the
[609.78 - 613.68] sharks are on the outside of the medical
[611.46 - 615.48] meeting communities medical meeting
[613.68 - 617.42] communities
[615.48 - 619.44] largest Health communities in the world
[617.42 - 622.08] millions of people around the world
[619.44 - 625.02] people that are not even on social media
[622.08 - 627.18] or whatever and what happens is is it
[625.02 - 629.64] became Feeding Frenzy have you noticed
[627.18 - 630.96] the ads that you show up in all your in
[629.64 - 634.32] all your feeds
[630.96 - 637.26] those are hundreds of companies trying
[634.32 - 638.58] to fish for medical medium people and
[637.26 - 641.34] fish them out of the medical meaning
[638.58 - 644.22] Community just so you understand it's a
[641.34 - 646.44] dog eat dog world out there and it's all
[644.22 - 648.66] about the money money money
[646.44 - 649.56] and that you change so what happens is
[648.66 - 651.72] that
[649.56 - 654.66] they just the sharks
[651.72 - 659.22] throw in everybody's feeds everybody all
[654.66 - 660.72] your feeds all the stuff right and
[659.22 - 663.66] they're fishing
[660.72 - 666.18] and even if they never even saw that one
[663.66 - 668.58] time there was this one zeolite and you
[666.18 - 671.52] know small quantities one zeolite at one
[668.58 - 673.68] time 10 15 years ago
[671.52 - 675.96] that can act at least
[673.68 - 679.50] as an absorbent through the intestinal
[675.96 - 681.84] tract even if they didn't even see that
[679.50 - 683.34] they're still hammering the zeolites
[681.84 - 684.66] because the zeolite industry is still
[683.34 - 685.92] going to take advantage of all the
[684.66 - 687.66] health communities so they go into the
[685.92 - 689.76] medical medium Health Community and they
[687.66 - 692.28] fish and they fish and they fish
[689.76 - 694.86] but all but you'll see that adds in your
[692.28 - 697.50] feeds from everything from fishing into
[694.86 - 699.30] like a fishing expedition to snag as
[697.50 - 700.92] many people from the medical medium
[699.30 - 703.80] communities they can snag and pull out
[700.92 - 705.78] and draw out that's how it's done out
[703.80 - 707.10] there
[705.78 - 708.66] what is the name of the book He's
[707.10 - 710.82] reading brain saver brain saver
[708.66 - 713.10] protocols
[710.82 - 715.58] so what happened though the zeolite
[713.10 - 718.20] industry grew and then the
[715.58 - 719.76] cross-contamination occurred which I've
[718.20 - 721.56] been talking about for a very long time
[719.76 - 724.86] so I've been talking about the cross can
[721.56 - 726.84] contamination which is the mix of the
[724.86 - 728.28] zeolite powers
[726.84 - 730.52] being
[728.28 - 733.74] farmed together
[730.52 - 736.56] harvested together out of the Earth
[733.74 - 739.44] and then process together and that
[736.56 - 744.12] didn't exist back years ago
[739.44 - 746.34] but that exists now so yeah absolutely
[744.12 - 747.72] very important to know no really good
[746.34 - 749.58] question though and I talk about that
[747.72 - 751.56] all the time about that and I really
[749.58 - 753.54] appreciate that awesome
[751.56 - 756.24] so let's go into something else so we're
[753.54 - 759.66] in problematic for the brain
[756.24 - 762.30] problematic and damaging supplements
[759.66 - 764.46] now keep in mind it's a large list
[762.30 - 765.60] so we got colostrum let's hit colostrum
[764.46 - 767.88] how many of you guys have tried the
[765.60 - 770.10] whole colostrum bandwagon right get on
[767.88 - 772.74] the colostrum bandwagon
[770.10 - 774.66] which for a lot of reasons is terrible
[772.74 - 777.12] we know that right
[774.66 - 778.86] colostrum is a dairy product that feeds
[777.12 - 780.42] pathogens so here you are your
[778.86 - 783.00] chronically ill you're sick and then
[780.42 - 785.10] you're told try the colostrum that's
[783.00 - 788.10] going to build up your immunity
[785.10 - 791.22] meanwhile colostrum itself in a human
[788.10 - 794.04] body feeds the reason why you're sick so
[791.22 - 797.52] any kind of pathogenic stuff it's the
[794.04 - 798.78] feed that pathogen that's in you so if
[797.52 - 800.58] you're sick with the chronic fatigue
[798.78 - 802.62] syndrome which is Epstein-Barr and
[800.58 - 805.32] that's mm info by the way going all the
[802.62 - 808.14] way back our ra that's mm info or
[805.32 - 810.36] thyroid thyroiditis it's mm info if
[808.14 - 813.12] you're sick with Epstein-Barr virus and
[810.36 - 814.98] you do the classroom what's happening is
[813.12 - 817.02] you're feeding the very virus that's
[814.98 - 818.88] actually causing the problem so
[817.02 - 820.56] colostrum is the very product that feeds
[818.88 - 823.44] pathogens
[820.56 - 825.54] wrangling says wow it's so cool all
[823.44 - 826.62] replays uploaded in the newsletters yeah
[825.54 - 828.30] you got to check out the medical meme
[826.62 - 831.72] those newsletter sign up when you can
[828.30 - 833.64] there's no pay wall sign up for
[831.72 - 837.24] newsletter we try to give just free free
[833.64 - 838.74] free free free free everything's free
[837.24 - 840.96] um I don't want to break this up into
[838.74 - 843.06] big courses and all that stuff and
[840.96 - 844.50] charge and don't want endless fees
[843.06 - 847.26] charging subscription fees and
[844.50 - 849.66] everything else I just want it free
[847.26 - 851.58] anyway so colostrum is the dairy product
[849.66 - 853.20] that feeds pathogens such as viruses and
[851.58 - 854.88] bacteria accelerating chronic illness
[853.20 - 856.44] classified this is interesting though
[854.88 - 857.94] what you'll learn in the medical healing
[856.44 - 859.92] books when you have these in your hand
[857.94 - 861.12] what you're going to learn these brain
[859.92 - 863.52] saver books is you're going to learn a
[861.12 - 864.60] lot about classified medical research in
[863.52 - 869.00] science
[864.60 - 869.00] classified medical research and science
[869.58 - 874.02] classified medical research and science
[871.62 - 876.12] use dairy products colostrum included as
[874.02 - 879.60] fuel source to feed and raise pathogens
[876.12 - 881.46] in Labs that's why we're sick now it's a
[879.60 - 884.82] hundred years
[881.46 - 887.34] little over a hundred years
[884.82 - 890.30] of science raising pathogens in labs and
[887.34 - 892.98] feeding dairy products to those
[890.30 - 895.68] pathogens and then slowly releasing
[892.98 - 897.24] those pathogens into the
[895.68 - 900.18] public
[897.24 - 903.84] as each decade went back by from the 19
[900.18 - 907.86] teens to 1920s to 1930s to 1940s to
[903.84 - 910.32] 1950s to 1960s until we got to Woodstock
[907.86 - 912.86] and then since Woodstock was blamed for
[910.32 - 915.96] all the free sex and all the free love
[912.86 - 917.52] and everybody was just having sex they
[915.96 - 921.06] were saying they're saying that was the
[917.52 - 923.34] spread of all the herpes simplex one but
[921.06 - 925.44] really it was already put out there for
[923.34 - 928.58] everybody long before my classified
[925.44 - 928.58] medical research and science
[928.82 - 933.66] let's go choose something else another
[931.32 - 936.96] area we talked about deer antler today
[933.66 - 939.86] we talked about a bunch of charcoal
[936.96 - 942.42] charcoal my favorite
[939.86 - 943.98] charcoal's my favorite you're taking
[942.42 - 945.96] your charcoal supplements everybody's
[943.98 - 947.76] saying oh I got charcoal I was
[945.96 - 949.44] recommended to do charcoal right the
[947.76 - 950.94] whole bit so let's hit charcoal for a
[949.44 - 952.62] little bit
[950.94 - 954.90] okay
[952.62 - 957.42] charcoal take it internally so remember
[954.90 - 959.58] that says charcoal taken internally
[957.42 - 961.80] we're in problematic and damaging
[959.58 - 963.60] supplements for the brain and body we're
[961.80 - 966.14] in the brain saver books you guys have
[963.60 - 969.84] to get the books when you get a chance
[966.14 - 971.76] charcoal including activated charcoal
[969.84 - 974.70] activated charcoal
[971.76 - 977.04] suffocates intestinal linings
[974.70 - 980.64] interesting
[977.04 - 983.10] suffocates the intestinal tract lining
[980.64 - 985.02] not allowing nutrients to absorb
[983.10 - 986.82] assimilate or easily pass through the
[985.02 - 988.44] intestinal Linings to the hepatic portal
[986.82 - 990.24] vein so what this means is when you take
[988.44 - 991.74] charcoal
[990.24 - 993.12] right
[991.74 - 995.28] I'm going to move this over you guys
[993.12 - 997.20] just bear with me for a second I'm just
[995.28 - 1000.20] very excited about the brain saver books
[997.20 - 1001.28] I made a lot of sacrifices to put these
[1000.20 - 1004.58] out here
[1001.28 - 1006.56] still making sacrifices and I feel that
[1004.58 - 1008.42] knowing it's in your hands and starting
[1006.56 - 1010.28] to get in your hands is just a relief
[1008.42 - 1012.88] it's like a relief I don't even know
[1010.28 - 1012.88] what else to say
[1013.34 - 1017.90] so when you take charcoal
[1016.34 - 1020.84] charcoal
[1017.90 - 1021.92] has a spread out Factor
[1020.84 - 1024.92] okay
[1021.92 - 1027.08] it tends to spread out and blow up so
[1024.92 - 1028.46] when charcoal gets into the intestinal
[1027.08 - 1030.92] tract
[1028.46 - 1032.84] it covers every single aspect of your
[1030.92 - 1034.70] intestinal lining
[1032.84 - 1036.74] not just part of your intestinal
[1034.70 - 1039.02] lighting
[1036.74 - 1041.96] and when it covers every aspect of your
[1039.02 - 1044.18] intestinal lining it's so tiny and so
[1041.96 - 1045.44] Nano in its form charcoal activated
[1044.18 - 1049.64] charcoal
[1045.44 - 1049.64] then it blocks uptake
[1049.94 - 1055.76] you actually lose the ability to uptake
[1053.26 - 1056.96] nutrients easy from your food so if
[1055.76 - 1058.64] you're having your salads and you're
[1056.96 - 1060.08] having your fruit you're having your
[1058.64 - 1061.88] meat you're having your whatever you're
[1060.08 - 1064.52] having your fish your chicken whatever
[1061.88 - 1065.96] it is that you eat or want to eat if you
[1064.52 - 1067.58] think there's a nutrient in any of it
[1065.96 - 1069.74] you're not going to get those nutrients
[1067.58 - 1071.84] readily accessible not going to get them
[1069.74 - 1074.90] at all easily because of charcoal the
[1071.84 - 1077.96] nutrients are going to get blocked and
[1074.90 - 1081.40] you're not going to have nutrient uptake
[1077.96 - 1081.40] at full satisfaction
[1084.38 - 1088.70] just keep on going with the charcoal
[1086.60 - 1091.34] charcoal is one of my favorites it's not
[1088.70 - 1095.74] my favorite as far as liking it it's my
[1091.34 - 1095.74] favorite as far as how ridiculous it is
[1097.10 - 1102.56] so the causes of nutritional
[1099.44 - 1104.66] deficiencies suffocating good this sorry
[1102.56 - 1107.72] this causes
[1104.66 - 1110.72] nutritional deficiencies suffocating
[1107.72 - 1113.18] good bacteria and microorganisms while
[1110.72 - 1116.30] allowing bad bacteria and microorganisms
[1113.18 - 1119.12] to thrive check this out
[1116.30 - 1120.80] a question there brain saver is a true
[1119.12 - 1123.50] Masterpiece many thanks for everything
[1120.80 - 1126.34] you do for all of all of us incredible
[1123.50 - 1126.34] thank you
[1126.50 - 1129.86] listen I just want you guys to have the
[1128.24 - 1131.48] answers I want you guys to be able to
[1129.86 - 1132.98] empower yourselves I want you guys to be
[1131.48 - 1135.02] able to protect yourselves that's all I
[1132.98 - 1137.30] care about
[1135.02 - 1138.74] if I cared about me me me me you'd see
[1137.30 - 1141.14] the Anthony Williams Show on Main Street
[1138.74 - 1142.90] mainstream TV I've been asked to do it a
[1141.14 - 1145.64] ton of times where it'd be like a series
[1142.90 - 1147.74] working on people blah blah blah I've
[1145.64 - 1149.78] turned down the Anthony Williams Show a
[1147.74 - 1152.12] dozen dozens and dozens of times because
[1149.78 - 1155.06] I need to make sure you get what you
[1152.12 - 1156.94] need I can't make this about being a
[1155.06 - 1160.94] star
[1156.94 - 1163.46] and I'm not a star okay so this causes
[1160.94 - 1165.62] nutritional deficiencies suffocating
[1163.46 - 1167.48] good bacteria and microorganisms while
[1165.62 - 1169.70] allowing bad bacteria microorganisms to
[1167.48 - 1172.28] thrive so here's how it works
[1169.70 - 1176.50] when you suffocate
[1172.28 - 1176.50] the intestinal lining with charcoal
[1176.60 - 1180.74] you're actually killing off good
[1178.88 - 1184.04] bacteria
[1180.74 - 1185.90] bad bacteria can be suffocated and
[1184.04 - 1188.36] Thrive even become even stronger that's
[1185.90 - 1190.52] how it works with bad bacteria charcoal
[1188.36 - 1192.50] does not remove toxic heavy metals and
[1190.52 - 1194.30] that's one of the biggest screw-ups in
[1192.50 - 1198.62] Alternative Health right there
[1194.30 - 1201.38] is is the misinformation of charcoal
[1198.62 - 1203.60] getting Metals out who says they've
[1201.38 - 1206.00] never seeded there's not one single
[1203.60 - 1208.58] paper that shows
[1206.00 - 1210.56] charcoal removing toxic heavy metals it
[1208.58 - 1213.26] doesn't exist
[1210.56 - 1217.28] it never did
[1213.26 - 1221.20] but for some reason it became like
[1217.28 - 1224.30] what is it now like concrete
[1221.20 - 1226.40] Granite Stone
[1224.30 - 1228.74] charcoal does not remove toxins heavy
[1226.40 - 1230.72] metals charcoal is not a binder for
[1228.74 - 1232.70] toxic heavy metals it's not a binder for
[1230.72 - 1235.70] toxic heavy metals either
[1232.70 - 1237.56] charcoal is the opposite so it does the
[1235.70 - 1240.26] opposite so check this out
[1237.56 - 1242.84] charcoal can keep toxic heavy metals
[1240.26 - 1244.64] from leaving the intestinal tract with
[1242.84 - 1246.86] an explanation here
[1244.64 - 1249.32] because the metals get buried under the
[1246.86 - 1253.10] charcoal As It Coats the intestinal
[1249.32 - 1255.08] tract lining what I love about SOC is
[1253.10 - 1258.68] the explanation after explanation after
[1255.08 - 1260.42] explanation the details details that are
[1258.68 - 1261.98] just mind-blowing to me all the time as
[1260.42 - 1263.84] I was doing the books I was sitting
[1261.98 - 1265.78] there I was like okay well give me the
[1263.84 - 1268.82] explanation
[1265.78 - 1270.98] charcoal even activated charcoal stains
[1268.82 - 1272.96] the walls of the intestinal tract and
[1270.98 - 1274.28] takes weeks to completely eliminate so
[1272.96 - 1276.56] here's how it works when you take a
[1274.28 - 1279.86] charcoal supplement
[1276.56 - 1282.74] it stains the lining of the intestinal
[1279.86 - 1285.28] tract in that stain doesn't leave for
[1282.74 - 1285.28] weeks
[1286.04 - 1290.24] I mean can you imagine what someone with
[1288.02 - 1291.68] crohn's colitis IBS any kind of
[1290.24 - 1293.18] intestinal tract disorders any kind of
[1291.68 - 1296.00] intestinal tract problems gastroparesis
[1293.18 - 1297.50] whatever it's serious
[1296.00 - 1298.64] I know I'm running through a lot of
[1297.50 - 1302.00] symptoms quick
[1298.64 - 1304.88] because I want to get to the good stuff
[1302.00 - 1307.94] charcoal is toxic to the body because it
[1304.88 - 1310.40] keeps toxins inside the body
[1307.94 - 1311.90] it is helpful to brush your teeth with
[1310.40 - 1314.12] an activated charcoal so here's how cool
[1311.90 - 1317.06] so if you look at me and you say hey aw
[1314.12 - 1318.80] maybe you got a thing against charcoal
[1317.06 - 1321.44] maybe you just don't like the charcoal
[1318.80 - 1323.48] companies or someone did you wrong and
[1321.44 - 1326.30] this is your way to get them back that's
[1323.48 - 1329.54] not true but watch this
[1326.30 - 1331.90] I'm Pro charcoal and this very thing I'm
[1329.54 - 1331.90] reading
[1332.72 - 1338.60] charcoal supplements periodically okay
[1335.92 - 1340.04] brushing your teeth with them if you
[1338.60 - 1342.08] brush your teeth with an activated
[1340.04 - 1345.68] charcoal periodically
[1342.08 - 1347.84] just make sure you don't swallow
[1345.68 - 1349.52] and instead spit out the charcoal then
[1347.84 - 1351.02] rinse your mouth really good as good as
[1349.52 - 1352.52] you can
[1351.02 - 1354.38] so you can brush your teeth with
[1352.52 - 1357.14] activated charcoal Spirit compassion has
[1354.38 - 1360.26] told me that that's that's okay
[1357.14 - 1363.02] so I have it in there because it's okay
[1360.26 - 1364.82] so let's do another one too
[1363.02 - 1367.40] let's hit
[1364.82 - 1368.96] gut powder blends
[1367.40 - 1371.74] so let's hit that one you guys I'm
[1368.96 - 1374.38] breathing out of brain saver protocols
[1371.74 - 1377.72] and I'm back
[1374.38 - 1381.44] today and this is brain saver right here
[1377.72 - 1384.26] they're 40 off amazon.com us I'm mind
[1381.44 - 1387.50] blown because they discounted it so much
[1384.26 - 1391.40] which is like Angelic to me because it's
[1387.50 - 1394.16] cost way more to make these books
[1391.40 - 1397.52] um there's a 20 book every
[1394.16 - 1400.88] section so it's like 20 book easy a 20
[1397.52 - 1402.38] hour book a 20 book a twenty dollar book
[1400.88 - 1403.94] I mean these books are like three four
[1402.38 - 1405.86] they should be three four five hundred
[1403.94 - 1407.48] dollars if you take all the information
[1405.86 - 1409.40] and everything and then you look at
[1407.48 - 1410.96] other health books out there
[1409.40 - 1414.14] this is like
[1410.96 - 1416.24] a dozen other health books that are
[1414.14 - 1419.86] whatever twenty dollars a piece or more
[1416.24 - 1422.90] or whatever okay gut powder blends
[1419.86 - 1424.88] abrasive scratchy combinations of
[1422.90 - 1427.16] irritants that do not balance the
[1424.88 - 1429.44] microbiome and do quite the opposite
[1427.16 - 1431.06] scramble up the microbiome see so here's
[1429.44 - 1432.98] how it works no one's going to take a
[1431.06 - 1435.98] look in here no one's got a microscope
[1432.98 - 1437.84] as you drop a gut powder blend
[1435.98 - 1440.00] from your functional guy or from
[1437.84 - 1442.70] somewhere online or some ad or something
[1440.00 - 1444.44] or this is good for your microbiome
[1442.70 - 1446.96] no one's going to know what's happening
[1444.44 - 1449.72] when that gut power plant goes down in
[1446.96 - 1452.18] here there's no way to know
[1449.72 - 1453.68] No One's Gonna have a camera
[1452.18 - 1455.54] No One's Gonna Do an endoscopy and have
[1453.68 - 1457.22] actually a camera in here watching the
[1455.54 - 1459.08] gut powder blend in your intestinal
[1457.22 - 1460.82] tract and see what it even does to even
[1459.08 - 1465.94] help microbiome or not
[1460.82 - 1465.94] it's all guessing games out of trends
[1466.46 - 1470.60] but what happens when you drop a gut
[1468.74 - 1473.72] powder blend
[1470.60 - 1475.58] you scramble up your microbiome you
[1473.72 - 1478.70] don't help it it breaks the natural
[1475.58 - 1481.40] rhythm of a microbiome and does the
[1478.70 - 1483.68] opposite and scrambles it all up
[1481.40 - 1485.60] this worsens intestinal tract conditions
[1483.68 - 1488.72] for sensitive people especially when
[1485.60 - 1490.64] dealing with nervous system issues such
[1488.72 - 1493.10] as vagus nerves
[1490.64 - 1494.66] and phrenic nerve inflammation resulting
[1493.10 - 1496.52] in increased anxiety and digestive
[1494.66 - 1498.08] stress ego you're going to the person
[1496.52 - 1500.24] that you need to go see it's like oh
[1498.08 - 1501.44] your microbiome's off here here's
[1500.24 - 1503.84] another gut powder here's another
[1501.44 - 1505.34] probiotic with it here's a probiotic
[1503.84 - 1507.32] powder mix with all this other stuff
[1505.34 - 1508.52] let's just keep on taking it down and
[1507.32 - 1510.20] meanwhile you're somebody that's already
[1508.52 - 1512.00] going to the doctor because you have
[1510.20 - 1514.82] anxiety you have depression you have
[1512.00 - 1516.62] weird feelings you have Panic you have
[1514.82 - 1517.94] different kinds of sensation in your
[1516.62 - 1520.34] intestinal tract you have all these
[1517.94 - 1521.78] issues that are vagus nerve related and
[1520.34 - 1525.38] you're seeing your practice sure because
[1521.78 - 1527.60] now you're taking the gut powder blends
[1525.38 - 1529.94] and it's just scratching the heck out of
[1527.60 - 1531.80] your intestinal lining uh irritating
[1529.94 - 1533.96] your vagus nerves
[1531.80 - 1536.78] gut powder Blends can throw an
[1533.96 - 1540.28] intestinal tract into spasm and I've
[1536.78 - 1540.28] seen it happen before
[1541.10 - 1547.82] creating cramping gastrointestinal pain
[1544.88 - 1549.92] gastro gastritis bloating Health
[1547.82 - 1552.08] practitioners will often mistake these
[1549.92 - 1554.62] reactions for a healing or detox of some
[1552.08 - 1557.42] sort so here's where things go wrong
[1554.62 - 1559.16] so you're doing your good powder blends
[1557.42 - 1560.54] you think you're fixing your microbiome
[1559.16 - 1562.46] and you're doing all this good stuff and
[1560.54 - 1563.84] now you get thrown into intestinal tract
[1562.46 - 1566.12] spasm and then you call your
[1563.84 - 1569.56] practitioner friend healer and they go
[1566.12 - 1569.56] you must be detoxing
[1569.96 - 1574.66] when you're in spasm because of a gut
[1572.00 - 1574.66] powder blend
[1576.32 - 1580.34] Health practitioners will often mistake
[1578.30 - 1581.92] these reactions for a healing detox of
[1580.34 - 1584.00] some sort so
[1581.92 - 1585.74] we're talking about the brain saver
[1584.00 - 1587.92] books have you tried the brain shot
[1585.74 - 1590.96] therapy

[1654.08 - 1660.68] asked SOC if he was there
[1657.68 - 1665.18] and he answered that he was looking at
[1660.68 - 1667.34] all the people with the disorder because
[1665.18 - 1669.82] yeah because what happened was let me go
[1667.34 - 1669.82] find that

[1678.50 - 1683.02] chicken cartilage for a second
[1680.60 - 1683.02] right
[1688.96 - 1694.00] I'm gonna find that right now so just

[1703.04 - 1706.70] you think I would know my way perfectly
[1704.96 - 1708.44] around these books but I gotta tell you
[1706.70 - 1710.96] I mean
[1708.44 - 1714.04] the amount of information
[1710.96 - 1714.04] okay here we are
[1715.04 - 1721.94] okay many times
[1718.22 - 1724.34] if you guys got a second many times
[1721.94 - 1727.10] as I was sitting at my desk receiving
[1724.34 - 1729.64] the information that you found here in
[1727.10 - 1729.64] these pages
[1730.40 - 1735.32] I would enter a sphere of light to take
[1733.52 - 1736.76] me out of my personal world and
[1735.32 - 1738.56] surroundings
[1736.76 - 1741.02] so that I could hear Spirit of
[1738.56 - 1745.82] compassion perfectly clearly
[1741.02 - 1749.54] and see any Vision that Spirit provided
[1745.82 - 1751.82] one day as I was sitting here waiting to
[1749.54 - 1754.78] transcribe words from Spirit about
[1751.82 - 1754.78] eating disorders
[1754.94 - 1760.04] I asked where are you getting choked up
[1757.78 - 1762.80] like right here
[1760.04 - 1767.68] ask where are you
[1762.80 - 1767.68] Spirit of compassion said I'm here
[1768.14 - 1774.92] I'm just opening up the plane
[1771.80 - 1777.86] to get a reading from over a billion
[1774.92 - 1780.32] Eating Disorders on this planet
[1777.86 - 1784.04] so I can provide the information that
[1780.32 - 1787.22] reaches everyone with eating struggles
[1784.04 - 1790.36] I want it to be comprehensive so
[1787.22 - 1790.36] everyone's included
[1790.52 - 1794.96] that gets me to Catherine Elizabeth
[1793.34 - 1797.00] because
[1794.96 - 1799.94] he
[1797.00 - 1800.66] you know I I don't usually you know I
[1799.94 - 1802.46] don't
[1800.66 - 1805.28] it's the kind of thing that when you
[1802.46 - 1807.80] hear it and you put it in writing to the
[1805.28 - 1809.60] words exact words that come through
[1807.80 - 1811.88] and you put it in writing you realize
[1809.60 - 1813.68] how many people are suffering when I
[1811.88 - 1815.60] think about it how many eating disorders
[1813.68 - 1820.46] and we know Eating Disorders can be hell
[1815.60 - 1822.38] hell on Earth eating disorders
[1820.46 - 1826.64] can
[1822.38 - 1827.90] cut people down like trees just it's
[1826.64 - 1829.88] just terrible
[1827.90 - 1832.16] eating disorder chapter is so
[1829.88 - 1833.84] mind-blowing and comprehensive that when
[1832.16 - 1835.94] you do read the eating disorder chapter
[1833.84 - 1839.36] and brain save or just be prepared
[1835.94 - 1841.34] because it's got so much information
[1839.36 - 1843.92] and we're talking about the eating
[1841.34 - 1846.26] disorder chapter but when you read the
[1843.92 - 1850.22] eating disorder chapter just be prepared
[1846.26 - 1852.80] to take the information in
[1850.22 - 1855.02] like just be prepared because it's so
[1852.80 - 1857.06] much there's so much information about
[1855.02 - 1858.62] eating disorders you have to almost it's
[1857.06 - 1861.02] not even just about reading between the
[1858.62 - 1863.26] lines it's every single line
[1861.02 - 1863.26] foreign
[1869.24 - 1873.32] it's going to change how people look at
[1871.10 - 1876.32] eating disorders and how the industries
[1873.32 - 1877.94] and people deal with eating disorders so
[1876.32 - 1879.92] this is going to change this book is
[1877.94 - 1881.96] going to change the fabric of eating
[1879.92 - 1884.12] disorders and how the industry views and
[1881.96 - 1886.28] looks at eating disorders
[1884.12 - 1888.28] yeah take a few years but it's going to
[1886.28 - 1891.86] change
[1888.28 - 1894.04] probably even rapidly
[1891.86 - 1894.04] foreign
[1896.56 - 1901.94] here too
[1899.54 - 1904.70] Spirit of compassion sees The Human
[1901.94 - 1906.98] Condition on this planet and then
[1904.70 - 1909.38] provides a deep understanding of how it
[1906.98 - 1913.10] came to be
[1909.38 - 1915.02] why and what to do with the resources we
[1913.10 - 1916.76] have here on this planet we only have so
[1915.02 - 1919.22] many resources on this planet to help
[1916.76 - 1921.14] heal us and spirit of compassion has to
[1919.22 - 1924.44] weed through it all right weed through
[1921.14 - 1926.78] all the resources that that aren't good
[1924.44 - 1929.32] and the resources that our answers and
[1926.78 - 1929.32] are good
[1932.08 - 1936.62] we see you
[1934.04 - 1938.78] we know what you're up against
[1936.62 - 1941.66] that's from Spirit of compassion in me
[1938.78 - 1944.30] so I wrote that here the spirit of
[1941.66 - 1947.06] compassion said you tell them that we
[1944.30 - 1948.50] see you and that's what he said to me
[1947.06 - 1951.98] and I remember sitting in my office
[1948.50 - 1954.08] chair the one I burned a hole in the
[1951.98 - 1956.18] seat cushion was just basically torn the
[1954.08 - 1958.12] shreds
[1956.18 - 1960.92] he said to me
[1958.12 - 1964.58] right we see you
[1960.92 - 1967.10] and I I said why he said say we see you
[1964.58 - 1969.26] we know what you're up against you tell
[1967.10 - 1973.54] them Spirit of compassion said to me
[1969.26 - 1973.54] that that we know what you're up against
[1975.56 - 1979.40] and then he said to me say this and I
[1977.72 - 1980.36] said okay I'll write this he said write
[1979.40 - 1982.94] this
[1980.36 - 1985.66] and we don't want you to go through it a
[1982.94 - 1985.66] moment longer
[1987.94 - 1992.42] Holly's help said Eating Disorders were
[1990.74 - 1994.34] so hard for me I struggled so bad
[1992.42 - 1996.92] healing with your info thank you

[2035.08 - 2039.88] you can be elevated above the Sea of
[2037.24 - 2042.82] confusion and noise and rhetoric
[2039.88 - 2044.86] of today's Health fads and trends
[2042.82 - 2048.66] in order to regain your health and
[2044.86 - 2048.66] navigate life on your own terms
[2049.12 - 2052.48] [Music]
[2050.86 - 2055.30] so I'm back in the supplements section
[2052.48 - 2057.10] for a little bit here you guys
[2055.30 - 2058.92] meaning this is a different Pro this is
[2057.10 - 2062.26] you know the supplement section meaning
[2058.92 - 2065.32] problematic and Mild mildly problematic
[2062.26 - 2067.48] supplements to our brain and bodies
[2065.32 - 2070.74] we're talking about charcoal then we're
[2067.48 - 2070.74] going in the chicken cartilage
[2071.08 - 2074.92] I didn't finish chicken cartilage these
[2073.00 - 2076.96] acids forced the body to really to
[2074.92 - 2080.14] release calcium storage to neutralize
[2076.96 - 2081.94] the acid while depleting bones
[2080.14 - 2083.38] can cause kidney stones and gallbladder
[2081.94 - 2086.02] stones so
[2083.38 - 2088.90] chicken cartilage supplements to a lot
[2086.02 - 2091.06] and not good we can we can go into so
[2088.90 - 2092.56] many things in here that are true let's
[2091.06 - 2095.08] do sodium bicarbonate how many times
[2092.56 - 2096.46] have you seen sodium bicarbonate sodium
[2095.08 - 2098.62] bicarbonate
[2096.46 - 2100.72] Lorraine L says I didn't feel seen or
[2098.62 - 2103.32] understood before so reading that and
[2100.72 - 2103.32] hearing that
[2105.34 - 2110.38] let's talk about the sodium bicarbonate
[2107.80 - 2111.82] I've watched a lot of people get
[2110.38 - 2114.46] themselves in trouble over the years
[2111.82 - 2115.90] with the sodium bicarbonate
[2114.46 - 2116.86] the one thing you're going to get from
[2115.90 - 2119.38] me
[2116.86 - 2121.42] if if you want to know a little
[2119.38 - 2124.96] something about medical media
[2121.42 - 2127.06] is that consistency
[2124.96 - 2130.96] when sodium bicarbonate blew up on the
[2127.06 - 2132.46] scene I wasn't on the bandwagon I wasn't
[2130.96 - 2135.06] saying you got to do all the sodium
[2132.46 - 2135.06] bicarbonate
[2135.64 - 2138.82] when charcoal blew up on the scene I
[2137.50 - 2142.50] wasn't saying you got to do charcoal
[2138.82 - 2142.50] here make sure you take your charcoal
[2144.04 - 2149.20] when products blew up on the scene along
[2147.22 - 2151.66] the way I didn't hop on that bandwagon
[2149.20 - 2153.40] bandwagon when
[2151.66 - 2155.50] anything like that happened there's
[2153.40 - 2158.56] always consistency mm info's always been
[2155.50 - 2160.36] mm info original Source going back and
[2158.56 - 2163.50] then people withdraw from it out there
[2160.36 - 2166.24] people in health would take from it
[2163.50 - 2168.22] and kind of poach little pieces along
[2166.24 - 2171.16] the way
[2168.22 - 2173.32] but you'll find consistency and it won't
[2171.16 - 2175.78] contradict itself
[2173.32 - 2177.70] it's not like each podcast doctor writes
[2175.78 - 2180.04] one book about something and three late
[2177.70 - 2181.66] years later oops sorry for leading you
[2180.04 - 2183.22] guys all down that road because I'm
[2181.66 - 2184.78] writing another book that's going this
[2183.22 - 2187.12] direction
[2184.78 - 2189.46] so everybody's just one big experiment
[2187.12 - 2191.44] great
[2189.46 - 2193.18] oyster supplements I'm noticing oyster
[2191.44 - 2196.00] supplements are big out there and
[2193.18 - 2198.88] happening on the scene right
[2196.00 - 2201.28] bottom dwellers such as oysters contain
[2198.88 - 2203.88] mercury dioxins
[2201.28 - 2206.02] strontium uranium
[2203.88 - 2208.36] petrochemicals and other toxic heavy
[2206.02 - 2210.36] metals not a good source of zinc that's
[2208.36 - 2214.00] another thing get your zinc from oysters
[2210.36 - 2216.90] oysters.zinc no they don't
[2214.00 - 2219.88] they got the tiny bit the tiniest bit
[2216.90 - 2222.46] you'd have to eat a barrel of oysters to
[2219.88 - 2224.32] get zinc from oysters a barrel you'd
[2222.46 - 2227.68] have to be doing oysters every night for
[2224.32 - 2229.78] dinner to get zinc for moistures
[2227.68 - 2232.00] I just love how this stuff happens it's
[2229.78 - 2233.92] like oh no oysters are zinc you get your
[2232.00 - 2236.38] zinc from oysters you do no you don't
[2233.92 - 2238.30] you just get a tiny bit of zinc for
[2236.38 - 2239.74] moisture so small in my meat you would
[2238.30 - 2241.42] have to eat a lot of oysters and you
[2239.74 - 2243.46] have to eat oysters so many oysters it
[2241.42 - 2247.18] would be ridiculous you'd have to suck
[2243.46 - 2249.04] down a dozen oysters twice a day
[2247.18 - 2253.60] and that won't even do it
[2249.04 - 2256.18] while oysters do contain some zinc
[2253.60 - 2259.68] zinc gets diminished and depleted from
[2256.18 - 2262.06] toxins zinc is the toxin
[2259.68 - 2264.34] equalizer so what happens is when you've
[2262.06 - 2267.52] got dioxins and mercury and an oyster it
[2264.34 - 2269.26] cancels out the zinc automatically
[2267.52 - 2271.42] the toxins
[2269.26 - 2273.28] okay so while oysters do contain some
[2271.42 - 2275.62] zinc zinc gets diminished and depleted
[2273.28 - 2278.80] from toxins the toxins in oysters cancel
[2275.62 - 2281.56] out the zinc that oysters provide
[2278.80 - 2283.00] consuming oysters oyster supplements
[2281.56 - 2286.12] because that's big right now is always
[2283.00 - 2287.92] oyster supplements or oyster extracts
[2286.12 - 2289.42] it's big right there I'm not making any
[2287.92 - 2292.84] friends again
[2289.42 - 2295.42] the kick me sign is on my back ready
[2292.84 - 2297.64] who knows what I'm gonna get
[2295.42 - 2301.26] soon tonight whatever tomorrow will kind
[2297.64 - 2301.26] of BS comes my way
[2301.48 - 2306.16] the toxins in oysters cancel out the
[2304.18 - 2308.20] zinc that oysters provide consuming
[2306.16 - 2309.46] oysters oyster supplements or oyster
[2308.20 - 2312.10] extracts
[2309.46 - 2314.38] does not restore zinc levels and clear
[2312.10 - 2316.14] up zinc deficiencies you will never be
[2314.38 - 2318.40] able to clear up a zinc deficiency
[2316.14 - 2322.02] eating oysters
[2318.40 - 2322.02] if your life depended on it
[2323.56 - 2328.74] we can go on and on and on the books are
[2326.32 - 2328.74] packed
[2329.56 - 2333.28] and we I mean there's so much
[2331.30 - 2334.84] information in here chlorophyll let's
[2333.28 - 2336.40] just do a little chlorophyll for a sec
[2334.84 - 2337.48] chlorophyll is big people call it the
[2336.40 - 2340.24] green water
[2337.48 - 2342.10] I'm taking my green water he's even see
[2340.24 - 2343.60] it on social media you see when you see
[2342.10 - 2345.16] YouTubers the problems might say like
[2343.60 - 2347.38] YouTubers are like got my green water
[2345.16 - 2349.72] here and then I got my other thing here
[2347.38 - 2351.52] and hey you guys I'm making my avocado
[2349.72 - 2355.06] toast and I'm taking my supplementation
[2351.52 - 2358.74] my fish oil my green water my you know
[2355.06 - 2361.66] my charcoal I'm taking my Pearl powder
[2358.74 - 2364.66] oh my God
[2361.66 - 2366.10] man when you get sick someday and you're
[2364.66 - 2369.28] doing all that it's not going to be fun
[2366.10 - 2370.90] climbing out of it okay
[2369.28 - 2372.10] so we'll do the chlorophyll for a couple
[2370.90 - 2373.06] of seconds all right because that's a
[2372.10 - 2376.00] big one
[2373.06 - 2377.80] get ready for this the body does not
[2376.00 - 2380.14] utilize chlorophyll that's been
[2377.80 - 2382.18] processed and singled out from its
[2380.14 - 2384.40] original Source because the chlorophyll
[2382.18 - 2387.10] is missing key components that are
[2384.40 - 2390.76] intertwined when chlorophyll is part of
[2387.10 - 2392.58] a complete Whole Food chlorophyll has to
[2390.76 - 2395.38] be part of a complete Whole Food
[2392.58 - 2396.82] chlorophyll cannot be isolated or
[2395.38 - 2400.18] separated
[2396.82 - 2402.40] it loses the rest of its constituents it
[2400.18 - 2404.14] loses the rest of its chemical compounds
[2402.40 - 2406.72] to actually make it work inside the body
[2404.14 - 2408.82] anybody doing chlorophyll in a tincture
[2406.72 - 2410.62] bottle or a liquid bottle that you buy
[2408.82 - 2413.28] in the store is not getting anything
[2410.62 - 2413.28] from it
[2415.90 - 2422.58] I saw someone say Atlantic dolls is high
[2418.00 - 2422.58] in Arsenic uh try again it's not
[2422.68 - 2427.54] unbelievable
[2425.02 - 2429.52] are you talking about Pacific dolls the
[2427.54 - 2432.46] great garbage patch
[2429.52 - 2434.38] because you might be talking about the
[2432.46 - 2435.82] specific dolls
[2434.38 - 2437.68] which
[2435.82 - 2441.78] for decades now
[2437.68 - 2445.12] we all know you ain't supposed to eat
[2441.78 - 2448.06] you're not talking about Atlantic
[2445.12 - 2450.04] dolls which doesn't have that but the
[2448.06 - 2451.66] great garbage patch all the way over
[2450.04 - 2453.64] there
[2451.66 - 2456.40] anything's possible
[2453.64 - 2458.20] and that's misinformation once again to
[2456.40 - 2460.06] scare someone and you know what that
[2458.20 - 2462.22] that actually happens because people out
[2460.06 - 2464.20] there in the health movements the gurus
[2462.22 - 2466.12] out there get so angry that they're
[2464.20 - 2468.10] constantly hearing about medical media
[2466.12 - 2470.50] and medical meeting info and medical
[2468.10 - 2472.90] medium books and dolls and wild
[2470.50 - 2474.52] blueberries they're so sick of it
[2472.90 - 2476.56] that they'll just come up with anything
[2474.52 - 2479.44] the adults is bad for you because of
[2476.56 - 2481.24] this oh don't do that because of this
[2479.44 - 2483.46] it's actually a sick world out there
[2481.24 - 2486.70] when you think about it I can't tell you
[2483.46 - 2489.40] how many people don't want people who
[2486.70 - 2491.98] are sick to heal they have they would
[2489.40 - 2493.84] rather have people suffer that on their
[2491.98 - 2496.24] hands and knees
[2493.84 - 2498.40] then ever heal
[2496.24 - 2500.14] they don't care because they have so
[2498.40 - 2502.48] much hatred in their heart
[2500.14 - 2503.56] so much hatred in their evil little
[2502.48 - 2506.68] heart
[2503.56 - 2508.00] that don't let people just stay sick and
[2506.68 - 2511.78] they'll spread terrible information
[2508.00 - 2513.76] because there's there's they're mentally
[2511.78 - 2515.32] sick with Darkness
[2513.76 - 2517.96] and so they want people who are
[2515.32 - 2520.06] chronically ill to stay safe that's the
[2517.96 - 2522.64] kind of world we're on
[2520.06 - 2526.36] we're in a world where there's good and
[2522.64 - 2527.62] evil I'm sorry but it's true and someone
[2526.36 - 2528.70] told me the other day that there's
[2527.62 - 2531.34] people that don't believe there's any
[2528.70 - 2532.96] evil that it's all just about your frame
[2531.34 - 2535.12] of mind Dimension it's all about love
[2532.96 - 2536.50] and everything else and it's not are you
[2535.12 - 2538.96] kidding me
[2536.50 - 2541.48] there's so much evil on this planet you
[2538.96 - 2543.88] guys know you can
[2541.48 - 2545.68] there's so much right and there's good
[2543.88 - 2547.66] on this planet too but it's still the
[2545.68 - 2552.24] battle still a spiritual battle good and
[2547.66 - 2552.24] evil it's still happening it's here
[2554.32 - 2557.34] all right so let's go into this a little
[2555.82 - 2560.20] bit I think I was going to talk about
[2557.34 - 2561.58] chlorophyll and I was I'm at your
[2560.20 - 2564.46] service you guys
[2561.58 - 2566.44] separating chlorophyll is a processing
[2564.46 - 2568.42] method stripping other phytochemical
[2566.44 - 2570.16] compounds that make chlorophyll usable
[2568.42 - 2572.56] and potent when it enters the body as
[2570.16 - 2574.24] part of a whole food the processing part
[2572.56 - 2576.60] of chlorophyll stops it from even
[2574.24 - 2580.30] working
[2576.60 - 2583.54] chlorophyll cannot be isolated and still
[2580.30 - 2585.58] serve a purpose so when you take
[2583.54 - 2587.68] chlorophyll supplements it can't serve a
[2585.58 - 2590.32] purpose it's throwing away money it's
[2587.68 - 2592.66] throwing away Everything Medical mediums
[2590.32 - 2596.32] book
[2592.66 - 2598.36] um for 29 these massive volumes here is
[2596.32 - 2600.70] way too much money I'm gonna buy a
[2598.36 - 2603.10] seventy dollar bottle of chlorophyll
[2600.70 - 2604.84] instead because this Guru over here in
[2603.10 - 2607.74] this other platform says you should be
[2604.84 - 2607.74] on chlorophyll
[2609.00 - 2613.42] chlorophyll can only be utilized if
[2611.50 - 2616.00] still in its natural source with other
[2613.42 - 2618.64] phytochemical compounds and nutrients
[2616.00 - 2620.44] it's becoming a trend to add a few drops
[2618.64 - 2622.90] of chlorophyll to your water to turn it
[2620.44 - 2626.68] green have you had your green water
[2622.90 - 2628.84] as if you were adding food coloring
[2626.68 - 2631.42] as a healing and beneficial alternative
[2628.84 - 2634.56] add some drops of parsley juice or
[2631.42 - 2637.36] barley grass juice powder to your water
[2634.56 - 2639.16] anyway there's so much information in
[2637.36 - 2640.48] here you guys it's packed I just want to
[2639.16 - 2642.70] give you a reminder here how to clean
[2640.48 - 2643.90] your books too so I want to show you
[2642.70 - 2647.26] this really quick so I put a little
[2643.90 - 2649.78] water on the tan towel they come greasy
[2647.26 - 2652.00] from Amazon's conveyor belts plus other
[2649.78 - 2655.24] Warehouse conveyor belts it's not from
[2652.00 - 2657.64] it's not from the publisher these came
[2655.24 - 2661.84] pristine they were these were minted
[2657.64 - 2663.58] pristine and beautiful and clean and
[2661.84 - 2665.68] then what happened is they got shipped
[2663.58 - 2668.68] beautiful clean and pristine to like
[2665.68 - 2670.30] Amazon so forth Amazon they take the
[2668.68 - 2672.76] book and they throw it on the conveyor
[2670.30 - 2674.44] belt conveyor belt is loaded with grease
[2672.76 - 2676.12] there's grease fittings on the conveyor
[2674.44 - 2678.34] belt and they grease them every other
[2676.12 - 2679.90] day with the machine so the conveyor
[2678.34 - 2681.88] belt just has all these metal rings
[2679.90 - 2683.56] going down and the book goes travels
[2681.88 - 2685.48] down the conveyor belt like this to be
[2683.56 - 2687.34] processed for your order and then by the
[2685.48 - 2688.96] time it gets to you it's grease here a
[2687.34 - 2691.30] little grease here some brown stuff here
[2688.96 - 2692.80] some Gunk here somebody working might
[2691.30 - 2694.12] have been eating a little something or
[2692.80 - 2696.34] drinking a little something got a little
[2694.12 - 2698.38] something on there so what happens is
[2696.34 - 2700.18] you take your towel with a little bit of
[2698.38 - 2702.04] dish soap and some dampness damp cloth
[2700.18 - 2704.14] and you clean your books off and they
[2702.04 - 2705.70] come out so nice that's probably a
[2704.14 - 2708.46] better thing instead of getting mad at
[2705.70 - 2710.08] me and giving me a one star look out for
[2708.46 - 2712.12] imposters
[2710.08 - 2714.64] um some imposters just recently wanted
[2712.12 - 2717.46] to ruin the medical medium book release
[2714.64 - 2719.98] by by throwing a tremendous amount of
[2717.46 - 2722.20] shade with misinformation there are
[2719.98 - 2723.82] imposters out there right now
[2722.20 - 2725.38] pretending to do some kind of
[2723.82 - 2727.42] consultation or reading which I don't do
[2725.38 - 2728.74] consultations consultations or readings
[2727.42 - 2730.14] with
[2728.74 - 2733.18] women
[2730.14 - 2735.46] and taking them for a ride and taking
[2733.18 - 2737.08] their money or taking their or with
[2735.46 - 2739.72] breaking their trust or whatever they're
[2737.08 - 2742.12] doing so there's imposters that are
[2739.72 - 2743.92] actually trying to get people to say oh
[2742.12 - 2747.10] aw is this bad person doing
[2743.92 - 2748.60] consultations and taking advantage of
[2747.10 - 2750.64] people their kindness and everything
[2748.60 - 2752.74] else so and their money or whatever it
[2750.64 - 2754.96] is so look out for imposters because
[2752.74 - 2756.88] they're out and then that's making
[2754.96 - 2759.88] people who have been hurt by the
[2756.88 - 2762.40] imposters to spread against the stories
[2759.88 - 2766.48] and posts
[2762.40 - 2769.48] about how bad Anthony Williams is with
[2766.48 - 2771.70] an S when it's Anthony William on top of
[2769.48 - 2773.50] it or whatever so anyway I just want to
[2771.70 - 2774.76] talk about the imposters as well sign up
[2773.50 - 2776.44] for the medical media newsletter because
[2774.76 - 2778.12] I got a whole bunch of Recaps and videos
[2776.44 - 2781.84] and all kinds of cool stuff and emails
[2778.12 - 2784.48] coming out and check out the recent
[2781.84 - 2785.98] podcast at Apple podcast I just did
[2784.48 - 2787.90] which is an incredible podcast because
[2785.98 - 2790.18] it was so fun and so good
[2787.90 - 2793.06] and if you can try to find a way to ask
[2790.18 - 2796.12] Tick Tock to give me my platform back on
[2793.06 - 2798.64] Tick Tock because they banned my Tick
[2796.12 - 2799.90] Tock page because I showed my brain
[2798.64 - 2802.66] saver books
[2799.90 - 2806.56] which is kind of pretty funny there but
[2802.66 - 2807.52] dog eat dog world
[2806.56 - 2812.26] um
[2807.52 - 2814.12] yeah so anyway good versus evil
[2812.26 - 2818.02] it's what it is
[2814.12 - 2820.30] okay so anyway you guys um I think oh if
[2818.02 - 2823.78] you can
[2820.30 - 2825.40] uh please leave a review on Amazon if
[2823.78 - 2828.28] you like or Barnes and Nobles or Amazon

[2845.74 - 2848.98] that's a whole other thing so if you
[2847.84 - 2851.68] take a look at the books and I'll talk
[2848.98 - 2854.50] about another day but the brain shock
[2851.68 - 2856.60] therapies brain shot therapies as well
[2854.50 - 2859.90] and
[2856.60 - 2862.06] what else over a hundred recipes healing
