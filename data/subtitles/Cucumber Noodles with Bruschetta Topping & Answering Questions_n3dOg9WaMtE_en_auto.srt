out there in the medical field

47
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,079
i'm going to start preparing food right

48
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,400
now

49
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,560
and i'm going to answer questions too so

50
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,479
i want to be helpful the best i can

51
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,240
what can you do to help with crohn's

52
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,600
disease when it comes down luanne when

53
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,880
it comes down to crohn's

54
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:50,159
um you got inflammation okay that's

55
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,680
inflammation inflammation is a mystery

56
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,200
to medical research in science they

57
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,840
don't know what causes it

58
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,960
so being that you know so anything they

59
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,479
label like crohn's

60
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:02,320
colitis ibs they they don't know what

61
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,079
causes it so that's one of the reasons

62
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,240
why it's so difficult to fix anything so

63
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,600
then everybody's playing guessing games

64
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,200
everybody's out there looking for

65
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,120
answers and they're like well how can i

66
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,480
fix this what can i do and then

67
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,720
and then they'll tell you hey it's your

68
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,239
genes they'll say luanne it's your genes

69
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,959
you just it's your bad genes that's why

70
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,480
you have

71
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,239
crohn's and then they'll come up with a

72
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,760
name like crohn's and

73
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,879
meanwhile they still don't know what the

74
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:27,840
inflammation is and then what happens is

75
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:29,920
you get the inflammation um and they get

76
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,920
narrowing of the intestinal tract

77
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,440
you can get it could bellow out you get

78
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,360
pockets you get narrowing and you just

79
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,000
get this chronic inflammatory condition

80
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,640
going on there

81
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,400
and so what i've always done teaching

82
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,840
doctors how to heal crohn's so they can

83
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,800
help their patients what i've always

84
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,680
done is

85
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,160
is the first things first is what foods

86
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,959
can be

87
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,640
trouble like what food can be causing a

88
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,599
problem with crohn's you know

89
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,160
and that's the first thing but the other

90
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,680
thing is

91
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,120
knowing the true cause of crohn's so

92
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,040
that's that's the other thing too so

93
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,760
it's knowing the true cause but

94
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,519
in order to know the true cause you know

95
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,599
that's one thing there you got to know

96
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,519
also like what to avoid

97
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:09,519
that's actually behind the true cause so

98
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:12,400
it's kind of like a combination right

99
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,200
and so when it comes down to crohn's

100
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,920
it's

101
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,360
what can we avoid the true cause

102
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,680
pathogens

103
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,680
toxic heavy metals do play a role okay

104
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,959
they do play a role toxic heavy metals

105
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,720
i'm peeling a cucumber right now because

106
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:28,159
i'm going to make some cucumber noodles

107
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,760
got this little tool right here and

108
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:31,519
you get a whole bunch of pathogens they

109
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,280
get inside the intestinal tract and they

110
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,680
start to weaken the lining

111
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,440
they start to inflame the lining you can

112
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,959
get streptococcus in there

113
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:42,720
e coli and they cause a lot of issues

114
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,319
they attach themselves to the lining of

115
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,000
the colon and you start getting little

116
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:47,920
pockets and little divots and that

117
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,400
happens to a lot of people

118
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,120
then the other thing is viruses too you

119
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,560
know a lot of

120
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,319
viruses create problems in the

121
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,280
intestinal tract lining

122
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:57,840
um so the combination of both of these

123
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,959
is really

124
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:03,360
is really contributing and then and then

125
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,599
you know um foods that aren't good that

126
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,040
keep on feeding these pathogens you know

127
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:09,120
like for instance i got something right

128
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,680
here

129
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,640
like this is not a good food right here

130
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,959
um

131
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,079
we're dealing with crohn's or colitis or

132
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,759
ibs or

133
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,120
digestive issues or intestinal tract

134
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,040
disorders

135
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,800
this is not a great food right here

136
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,320
these beautiful eggs right here aren't

137
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,479
they pretty right

138
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,080
and terrible food for any kind of

139
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:30,400
condition but i'll talk about those in a

140
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,400
little bit

141
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,280
um the thing is is the intestinal tract

142
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,040
gets so sensitive i hear those eggs

143
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:40,000
rolling around on the plate right now

144
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,520
tesla track gets so sensitive too

145
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
because the nerve endings start to get

146
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,720
sensitive

147
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,240
because you get in that inflammation so

148
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,000
all the nerve endings in the intestinal

149
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,520
tract are really get they really get

150
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,040
sensitive so when you're eating foods

151
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,919
you don't know what's helping or what's

152
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,360
not

153
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:55,280
and that's something that gets becomes

154
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,720
very difficult um

155
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:01,919
what i like to do with with crohn's is

156
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,600
um steamed potatoes are really gentle

157
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,840
really easy on the system but they're

158
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,240
also anti-pathogen

159
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,320
so um that's one food right there that i

160
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,840
like to i like to teach doctors to use

161
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,400
for their patients

162
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:16,240
papaya banana that's a big one right

163
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,919
there so papaya banana do i have any

164
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,639
bananas back here i don't have either or

165
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:22,080
i thought i

166
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:25,120
thought i had some bananas back there um

167
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,479
and and also there's protocols in the

168
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,840
medical meeting books you can take to

169
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,600
your doctor and all that

170
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,560
you know and have them have them look at

171
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,800
it right there you guys are making

172
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,840
cucumber noodles

173
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,800
but papayas bananas are really good for

174
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,280
crohn's

175
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,000
that one's very helpful soothing it

176
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,080
helps to

177
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,039
push past some of those narrowings so

178
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,960
that

179
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,639
people with crohn's can can go to

180
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,160
bathroom easy because that's a problem

181
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:49,440
you get lots of different constipation a

182
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:53,440
lot of pain

183
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,639
and all that stuff but what to avoid is

184
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,199
a critical thing

185
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,479
milk cheese butter eggs the very eggs i

186
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,280
was just showing you

187
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:02,960
definitely avoid those eggs and gluten

188
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,400
because all those will feed bugs so what

189
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,680
happens is

190
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:09,680
if you got the strep bacteria

191
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,680
and you're eating the eggs because now i

192
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,280
got a real egg here in front of me

193
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,039
and you know the strep bacteria is

194
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,360
sitting inside the intestinal tract and

195
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,520
it's

196
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,039
it's camped there there's colonies of it

197
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,560
and that that goes for people with a lot

198
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,440
of digestive tract disorders that aren't

199
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,520
even diagnosed

200
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,720
properly or not where it's mystery it's

201
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,720
like okay what's going on you got

202
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,039
cramping bloating all of that

203
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,560
and what happens is that bacteria just

204
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,639
loves to feed on eggs so we're eating

205
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,000
eggs thinking that's a great food and

206
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,919
then all of a sudden you know that's

207
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
that's that's the food it's eating

208
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,840
and then it proliferates two weeks later

209
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,240
conditions are worse but yet the egg

210
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,199
felt

211
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,880
so good it felt so good it went down it

212
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,720
was easy on the system

213
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,319
it didn't rub on any of the lining it

214
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,039
didn't trigger off any of the nerve

215
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,000
endings

216
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:54,160
the egg was just it was just so easy it

217
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
turned just into a glue that goes into

218
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,520
down the patch like a glue that just

219
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,440
sits in the center of the intestinal

220
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,840
tract and works its way down right

221
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:04,080
and it doesn't trigger any kind of like

222
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:06,160
pain or any kind of discomfort

223
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,240
so we think the eggs are probably a safe

224
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,000
bet but what the egg does is it keeps on

225
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,680
feeding all the bugs and the bugs create

226
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,199
more inflammation and then we get more

227
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,240
problems and then we're sensitive to

228
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,520
lettuce

229
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,960
meaning in the sense that because you

230
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,720
feel the lettuce going down and then

231
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,759
we're sensitive to other things and

232
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:26,639
there's a lot of confusion but

233
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:26,639
that's what happens there um

234
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,680
okay so i'm just get i'm just preparing

235
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,000
some cucumbers here i'm going to turn

236
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,280
them into

237
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,039
noodles in a little bit i'm going to

238
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,840
make the sauce with the brisket on top

239
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:36,240
of it

240
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,759
um bruschetta you can call it bruschetta

241
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,520
some people call it bruschetta

242
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,599
some people call it bruschetta some

243
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:45,039
people call it something different

244
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:48,080
um i'm going to cut these ends off right

245
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:48,080
here this cucumber

246
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,199
insulin resistance lori insulin

247
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:57,120
resistance

248
00:07:53,199 --> 00:08:00,400
okay fat equals

249
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:03,840
insulin resistance right there okay fats

250
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:06,639
and i mean milk cheese butter eggs

251
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:08,720
chicken beef i'm not going in i'm not

252
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:12,720
going against animal protein

253
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:16,160
nut butters okay nut butters nut milks

254
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:19,199
all right avocado oils coconut oil

255
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:23,120
even healthy fats right all fats

256
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:25,520
lead to insulin resistance so it's about

257
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,120
how much fats in your diet like how much

258
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,560
fat is in your diet you know like are

259
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,639
you guys

260
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,680
like how much fats in your diet are you

261
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,719
guys doing like

262
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,560
a lot of fat in your diet because that

263
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,320
this is insulin resistance right here

264
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,719
i'm showing you insulin resistance

265
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,479
that's what this is okay so here's how

266
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:45,200
it works okay even somebody

267
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,640
that doesn't have real real high insulin

268
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,480
resistance like it's not off the chart

269
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,279
yet it's always there for everybody no

270
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,880
matter what

271
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:53,680
so you got all your fats right there you

272
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,160
got your burger and that's a beef burger

273
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,920
okay

274
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,760
that's not a vegan burger that's a beef

275
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,560
burger and

276
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,680
all that fat in there okay what that

277
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,560
does is it blocks

278
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:06,080
sugar from entering your cells so you

279
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,000
have to basically produce a lot of

280
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,160
insulin but the fat stops the insulin

281
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,200
from taking sugar into cells and then

282
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,200
you got the cheese

283
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,959
more fat right there and cheese has got

284
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,399
sugar in it too which makes it even

285
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,120
worse because you got fat and sugar

286
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,040
combined

287
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,320
right you got more sugar which is the

288
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,839
bun

289
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:25,519
okay and then you got fried potatoes

290
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,839
fried french fries right

291
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,040
see those fried french fries those are

292
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,279
fried in oil

293
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,440
so when they're fried in oil what do you

294
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,920
have you have insulin resistance because

295
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,399
you got

296
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,120
sugar and fat sugar and fat you see the

297
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,600
burger

298
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,720
the burger is sugar and fat that's what

299
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,360
the burger is

300
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,399
what's the best thing on this plate well

301
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,519
the potato

302
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:50,320
is one of the best things but the

303
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,920
potatoes been crucified it's been

304
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,399
annihilated i don't know it's been just

305
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,839
it's been

306
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:57,200
injured because and or sacrificed

307
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,760
whatever it is because it's been fried

308
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:02,160
in oil so the potatoes been hindered

309
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,160
right and but what's the best thing here

310
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,839
well these pickles well that's that's

311
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,519
vinegar so these pickles aren't that

312
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,720
great you see that because these pickles

313
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,959
are vinegar right

314
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,640
tomatoes the best thing the onion's the

315
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:15,519
best thing and the lettuce is best thing

316
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:17,040
in this whole setup right if the

317
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:20,160
potatoes weren't

318
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:23,360
fried in oil that would be

319
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,959
one of the best things too so anyway

320
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,160
watch i don't spill this off the this

321
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:33,839
thing doesn't pop off the plate

322
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:33,839
i don't want that popping off the plate

323
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,800
and then

324
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,800
um the plate was greasy there's so much

325
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,760
fat in that food

326
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,640
so much that that's from a restaurant

327
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,480
around the corner

328
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,839
there's so much fat in that food that

329
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,079
that like the grease

330
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,680
on the plate it just found its way on

331
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:55,600
the plate it's all over my hands and i

332
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:58,959
really don't want grease

333
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:01,519
on my bruschetta and cucumber noodles

334
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:03,040
all right let's get going let's talk

335
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,079
about insulin resistance okay how about

336
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,200
we do that

337
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:08,000
what happens is fat fills up in your

338
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,240
bloodstream

339
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,519
when you have that cheeseburger or the

340
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,720
peanut butter smoothie

341
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:15,120
because you're putting peanut butter in

342
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,240
your smoothie or peanut butter on your

343
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,880
oatmeal

344
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,320
oatmeal has enough fat in it by itself

345
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:23,279
naturally right

346
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,160
but that's okay that's all right that's

347
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:26,240
right but when you

348
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,279
add fat to your oatmeal like all that

349
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,680
peanut butter

350
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,640
you get yourself in trouble because the

351
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,880
sugar in that

352
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,480
oatmeal the sugar the carbohydrate and

353
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,120
that oatmeal can't find its way into

354
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,800
your cells

355
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:41,360
so your pancreas has to whoo has to

356
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,959
pedal to the metal man that pancreas has

357
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:46,480
to pedal to the metal

358
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:49,440
if your pancreas could talk it would say

359
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,440
it would say oh no

360
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,959
why did that person just put all that

361
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,279
fat with that sugar

362
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,399
that carbohydrate because now i'm going

363
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:58,800
to have to produce

364
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,480
way more insulin and burn my pancreas

365
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,160
out so by the time they're 40 years old

366
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,240
they got type 2 diabetes

367
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,079
by the time they're 45 they got type 2

368
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,480
diabetes

369
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:10,800
even type 1 diabetes whatever i mean and

370
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:14,399
so your pancreas just has to spill out

371
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:16,399
all of that insulin to try to get that

372
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:19,360
carbohydrate into cells

373
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,240
because guess what we run on sugar news

374
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,839
flash

375
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,440
not to you guys you guys know this stuff

376
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:26,000
by now because you've been watching

377
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,160
uh you know the medical medium books and

378
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,680
and podcasts and everything else right

379
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:34,480
but news flash to anybody else all right

380
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:36,160
your body has to run on sugar you can't

381
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,639
function you can't do nothing i can't do

382
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,680
this

383
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,320
without sugar that's it sugar takes care

384
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,720
of it

385
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,320
and if you don't have sugar which is

386
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,040
hence your blood sugar which

387
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,240
is glucose which runs at your brain it

388
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:51,120
runs your thoughts

389
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,800
people say you know what he talks so

390
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,160
fast you know

391
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,320
i got friends that say you know what why

392
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,120
don't you talk slower on all your videos

393
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,959
and all your

394
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,480
podcasts and i'm like i have to force

395
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:03,600
myself to talk slow

396
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:05,279
i have to force myself and and they're

397
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,000
like well he must be jacked up on tons

398
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:10,079
of caffeine

399
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:14,320
no i'm not that's sugar that's glucose

400
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:17,200
that's natural carbohydrate in a potato

401
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,279
that's sugar from a lemon that's sugar

402
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,519
from a tomato

403
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:24,560
that's where it comes from but guess

404
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:26,480
what that sugar is not blocked by fat

405
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,839
so yeah i could have a little avocado i

406
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,279
love avocado

407
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,880
yeah i could have a little bit of tahini

408
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:33,920
i love tahini

409
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,639
sure you can have that i love hemp seeds

410
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:38,240
hemp seeds

411
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:40,560
amazing food but you know i'm cautious

412
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,760
i'm not gonna sit there and and and do

413
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,360
it all day long

414
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,880
i'm not gonna be doing hemp seeds on and

415
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,480
off and then throw some nut butters in

416
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,440
there and then have chicken at night and

417
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,560
then

418
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:52,320
and then to do a guacamole and then what

419
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,600
happens is you just do too much fat

420
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,839
too much fat too much for that too much

421
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,399
fat and it stops the sugar

422
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:00,160
from going into your cells because

423
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,680
insulin has to be produced and then the

424
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,839
fat blocks it now you got insulin

425
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,839
resistance

426
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:08,079
tomatoes really good that's going to

427
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:11,839
make a great

428
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:14,000
bruschetta so let's do one more cucumber

429
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:14,000
here

430
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:18,800
type 2 diabetes is such an easy fix it's

431
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:23,440
ridiculous

432
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:27,120
easiest fix there is so easy

433
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:28,639
um science and research never knew

434
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,120
still doesn't know how to get rid of

435
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:32,160
type 2 diabetes so you got all that

436
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,760
money

437
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,839
millions and millions of dollars going

438
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:38,800
into the medical industry

439
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,279
billions of dollars big pharma and all

440
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,440
all their

441
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:43,440
paid for studies and they still can't

442
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:46,560
fix type 2 diabetes

443
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,560
it's such an easy fix it's such an easy

444
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,399
fix

445
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,240
get your liver better lower your fats

446
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:54,800
get your liver stronger okay

447
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,360
you learn how to eat right okay then you

448
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,959
can heal

449
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,480
that insulin resistance your pancreas

450
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:00,480
builds up and boom you're out of it you

451
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:04,399
don't even need insulin anymore

452
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,399
um so

453
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:13,839
wait let me just get this one going here

454
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:13,839
because i want to still talk about that

455
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:20,720
so what happens is when someone stops

456
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,760
sugar okay so check this out you guys

457
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,959
all right

458
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:28,079
when someone stops sugar okay

459
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:31,360
and they start to improve

460
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:32,160
they're only improving because they're

461
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,120
taking

462
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,720
the critical piece away that you need to

463
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,839
get into yourselves but they only

464
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,360
improve

465
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:44,079
because they took one

466
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,360
of the very things out see it's it's fat

467
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:48,079
and sugar

468
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,040
combined that causes insulin resistance

469
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:51,680
but it's fat

470
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,720
that's the troublemaker and that's the

471
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,680
big causer right

472
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,040
but when you remove sugar then you have

473
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,000
all this fat floating around in your

474
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:01,519
bloodstream

475
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,440
and less insulin is produced because

476
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,800
there's not enough sugar floating around

477
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,440
in your bloodstream

478
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:09,120
so less insulin is produced so there's

479
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,320
just it's just like okay but that's not

480
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,000
the fix that's not

481
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,279
how to fix it that's not how it works

482
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,880
because guess what your diabetes is

483
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:16,399
still there and it's not going away

484
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,480
it's never going away because then all

485
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:21,120
of a sudden you're gonna eat some sugar

486
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,959
wow i've been on this diet for a long

487
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,519
time i'm keeping all my carbohydrates

488
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,839
away

489
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,959
my doctor says my a1c is getting better

490
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,959
it's dropping

491
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:30,800
but yet i'm just dying for a

492
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:31,680
carbohydrate i'm dying for a little bit

493
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,399
of sugar

494
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:36,320
let me eat this candy oh my god my a1c

495
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,639
oh my god my sugar's off the chart

496
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:41,199
oh my god something's wrong and and what

497
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,079
happens is my type 2 diabetes is back in

498
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:45,120
full force

499
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:47,519
i had an orange i had a piece of bread

500
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,720
but what the reality is the truth is if

501
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,720
you take out the fats

502
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:53,199
you can eat a piece of bread you can eat

503
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,120
an orange you can eat a piece of candy

504
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:56,560
and guess what you're not going to have

505
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,600
any insulin resistance you're not going

506
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,959
to have any type 2

507
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:05,360
diabetes it's not even going to be there

508
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:07,919
that's how it works anyway

509
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:09,679
lucas thanks for the tip with the high

510
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,839
uh quality spirulina

511
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:13,520
it made almost all the difference to me

512
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:17,120
lucas

513
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:18,559
supplements being the highest quality

514
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,400
or the best for a whole bunch of

515
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:22,400
different reasons is critical for

516
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:25,439
healing i've been saying this for years

517
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:28,400
years ago years ago

518
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:29,120
there was crap out for supplements crap

519
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,120
right

520
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:33,440
so it was really hard to get people

521
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:36,960
better even if spirit of compassion said

522
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,760
this person needs nettle leaf to get a

523
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,720
nettle leaf

524
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:41,280
product to do its job to take somebody

525
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,080
to the

526
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,520
finish line was hard right same thing

527
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,280
spirit of compassion said this person

528
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,559
needs spirulina to get toxic heavy

529
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,240
metals out right like you're talking

530
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:53,280
about lucas the spirulina

531
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:55,520
then it's got to be the right kind and

532
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,400
that's always been the problem out there

533
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,080
you know always

534
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,520
and this is the kind i use you guys know

535
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,880
that the vimorgy

536
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:05,440
uh v as in victor i am as in mary ergy

537
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,559
dot com spin rg but and i'm not

538
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,120
sponsored but it's

539
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:11,280
it means everything the higher quality

540
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:13,200
means everything to getting better

541
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,640
and i that's been the fight all these

542
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,520
years it's been like okay

543
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,919
i can work with foods with people right

544
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,360
but

545
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:23,679
if they have these these epstein bars

546
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:25,600
these shingles these the streptococcus

547
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:28,640
they have these toxic heavy metals

548
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,960
i need more than just just the foods you

549
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,480
know

550
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,160
spirit of compassion told me for years

551
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,200
you need more than that it's like you

552
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,720
have to have the best

553
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:38,160
quality of of supplementation

554
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,520
and so the vimraj is the best quality

555
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,120
and they have a whole line of stuff

556
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,080
that's incredible i got me and i got it

557
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,520
here

558
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,840
because it's what i take it's a

559
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,120
magnesium i take it's vitamin c i take

560
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,559
the micro state

561
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:52,080

i got everybody eating avocado

641
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,679
because guess what it was considered to

642
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:45,039
be poisonous 35 years ago

643
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:47,280
the health scene was against avocado

644
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:48,159
you were you were laughed off a lecture

645
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,159
stage

646
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:51,360
if you said an avocado was healthy fat

647
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:53,360
did you know that

648
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,640
you were laughed off of a health lecture

649
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:58,080
stage

650
00:21:54,640 --> 00:22:00,480
and um and so i got avocado really

651
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:02,240
really out there i mean i spent years

652
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:07,200
teaching doctors teaching people

653
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:07,200
teaching everybody about that and so

654
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:12,000
um and it's a it's a better fat because

655
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,679
all those years ago i was trying to get

656
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
people off of the bad fats

657
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:17,679
i was trying to get people off of this

658
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,679
so i spent a lifetime trying to get

659
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:23,360
people off of that right there

660
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:25,840
okay to onto avocado years ago

661
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:28,080
but here's the thing when you're

662
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:30,720
chronically ill

663
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,360
when that plate's greasy the plate's

664
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,799
really greasy

665
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:37,840
when you're chronically ill okay

666
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:38,720
you need you need a step above that you

667
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:41,360
need a step

668
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:43,120
further than just the avocado the

669
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,720
healthy nuts and seeds the almonds the

670
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,520

00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:49,520
the hemp seeds the coconut oil you need

673
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,039
to step further than that

674
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,960
if you're really sick you're really

675
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:55,600

right there's there's hundreds of

681
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:06,240
conditions

682
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:07,919
and you need more more than just

683
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,520
it's not just good enough to be like i'm

684
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,240
going to go keto and still have some

685
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,760

687
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,240
still have my nuts and seeds every day

688

and my cacao

689
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,520
it's not enough if you want to go to the

690
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:19,520
finish line

691
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:22,080
and i've always taught that for 35 plus

692
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:23,919
years it takes more than that

693
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:26,080
it takes it takes much more than that

694
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:26,799
you know and and that's really important

695
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,440
to know

696
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:29,440
it really is

697
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,720
so

698
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,880
erica what about type one

699
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,880
um when it comes down to type one type

700
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,279
one is

701
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,799
is a is a pancreas injury science

702
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:49,279
research doesn't know that but

703
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:50,640
food poisoning um creates a lot of

704
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:52,640
situations where people go

705
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,320
they become type one they have that

706
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,000
condition because of food poisoning

707
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,520
you could have food poisoning and be

708
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,600
type one a week later

709
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:01,679
you get out food poisoning and be type

710
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,799
one a year later two years later from

711
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,440
food poisoning right

712
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:07,279
right and also pathogens you know

713
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:10,159
viruses get into the pancreas and they

714
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,159
create type 1

715
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:17,120
and and even with

716
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:19,360
delayed type 1 where it's like a slow

717
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:22,240
progression of type one

718
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:23,200
um late in type one so even with that so

719
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:26,480
um

720
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:28,799
and and look there's there's a there's

721
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,480
you always have to keep it in your heart

722
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:31,440
and soul that there's always hope to

723
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,679

00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,360
it's just about doing doing enough of

725
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:37,840

729
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,240

most important thing with type one

739
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:03,840
the most important thing is to

00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:06,080
make sure it's not getting worse

741
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,360

so it's doing the right things to keep

749
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,440
type 1 stable

750
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,279
so your pancreas doesn't get a further

751
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,960
injury so it doesn't um

752
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:26,559
doesn't become more problematic more

753
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,480
inflamed and

754
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:30,240
that's the key it's about hey i want my

755
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,799
type 1 to be here for the rest of my

756
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,120
life

757
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:35,200
and not all of a sudden worse and that's

758
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:37,120
the key or i want my type 1 not only

759
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,559
here but i want my type 1 a lot better

760
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:41,440

too and ask your doctor if you can do 32

762
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,880

ask your doctor if you can do that ask

764
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,520
your doctor

765
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,760
if you can do any of the protocols

766
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:52,320
medical media protocols

767
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,320
but anyway

768
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,840

769
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:04,880

there always is a lot of hate groups i

782
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,960
think right

783
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:39,840
um you know there's there's always that

784
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,440
happening

785
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:43,200
i think i'm an easy target because of

786
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:46,799
discrimination

787
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:49,360
and there's a ton of lies and

788
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:50,640
i mean that's just how it's always been

789
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,320
what happens is

790
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:54,080
you know you get discriminated against

791
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:56,400
when you hear a voice

792
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,600
spirit of compassion since age four and

793
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,679
you get discriminated

794
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,360
against when you get too many people

795
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:02,559
better because a lot of people get

796
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,000
jealous in the health field in the

797
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:06,320
health industry

798
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,720
they get jealous they're like why does

799
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:10,799
he have millions and millions of people

800
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,240
following his information you know they

801
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:13,679
just can't wrap their heads around it a

802
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,640
lot of people they're either jealous or

803
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:16,559
they're just

804
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,159
psycho about it or something i mean it's

805
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:19,919
really weird i think

806
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:21,520
what happens is like why is he the

807
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:24,880
number one health author

808
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:28,159
in the world for seven years running why

809
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:31,200
i mean and just so you know um

810
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:32,720
the medical medium book series okay is

811
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,520
the number one health series in the

812
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,919
world

813
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:37,840
right so keep that in mind because it

814
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:39,600
works not because of promotion or money

815
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,960
or marketing because i didn't use any pr

816
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,720
marketing so

817
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,240
there's a lot of lies i'll give you a

818
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,279
whole rundown of just a few of them

819
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,559
right now

820
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:50,480
a number one lie he must have serious

821
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:53,600
money behind his

822
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:55,039
marketing and pr firms and how else did

823
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:58,240
he get to where he is

824
00:27:55,039 --> 00:28:01,279
and 100 inaccurate all right

825
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:04,640
no pr firms no publicists

826
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:06,080
uh no money into pr and all that okay so

827
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,960
that's number one that's a lie that's

828
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,880
been out there

829
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,799
a simple lie is everybody thought i was

830
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,159
27 years old for the longest time

831
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:14,159
so every time i said i've been in this

832
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:15,200
for 30 years everybody would go bananas

833
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,720
and berserk

834
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,399
and they'd be like that's impossible

835
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,960
okay obviously you know

836
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:23,039
i'm much much older than that and that's

837
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,880
just one all on its own okay

838
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:26,720
other lies too there's lots of them i

839
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,600
mean it's just the list goes on and on

840
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,360
and on but

841
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,640
but i think what happens is for because

842
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,840
i've talked to

843
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,919
a couple of my friends about this

844
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:36,240
doctors and stuff they're like look

845
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:37,520
500 million people in the world know who

846
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,840
you are and

847
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,720
medical medium information has spread

848
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,480
beyond

849
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,159
and around the world because it's the

850
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,919
number one health selling

851
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:48,320
series and health books there are on the

852
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:50,399
planet and that's going to lead to

853
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:52,240
a lot of discrimination especially where

854
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:54,240
your source is coming from above

855
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:56,840
since age four so there's gonna be lots

856
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,880
of all that it's just just tons of that

857
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:01,200
stuff

858
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,200
um

859
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,039
i mean

860
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:13,840
but you gotta be careful you know with

861
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:13,840
that and just you know

862
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:19,200
there's so many lies it's just it's over

863
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:20,880
it's it's over the chart i mean it's

864
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,520
it's off the chart there's so many so

865
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,279

lies and stuff like that

902
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:57,519
did you know two women um came to me

903
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,559
back last spring about a year ago and

904
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:02,000
told me

905
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:04,960
that an organization was paying

906
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,080
was paying people to spread rumors and

907
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:09,519
lies

908
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:13,120
and so both these women were enter

909
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:15,440
what they were they were approached and

910
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:17,360
offered money but what they did instead

911
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,000
of taking the money like so many do in

912
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,000
the hate groups

913
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,760
and stuff instead of taking the money

914
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,039
these two women

915
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:29,039
contacted medical media and

916
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:31,360
let us know okay let us know

917
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:33,679
about this thing that was happening

918
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:37,600
where they were offering money

919
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:40,320
to write stories claim things

920
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:43,120
to try to take down the mm so that

921
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:45,120
everybody stops healing around the world

922
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,240
i'll tell you right now and it was the

923
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,960
people you least

924
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,399
expected that were actually spreading

925
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:53,039
the lies and stories people that you

926
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:54,000
would never think that seemed so sincere

927
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:57,120
and so

928
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:00,240
oh yeah you know medical medium and

929
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:02,080
i'm just living my life and you know

930
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,840
with my cute little family and whatever

931
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:06,320
it is and just spreading the word you

932
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:08,720
know spreading bad rumors and lies or

933
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:12,480
people you would never even believe

934
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,480
so it's it's crazy how it works

935
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:17,360
and they approached a lot of people they

936
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:19,440
approached it's it's really

937
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:20,799
it was so sinister and they could still

938
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:24,159
be doing it

939
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:24,159

tomatoes here you guys let me take a

952
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:57,840
look here

953
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:57,840

954
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,760
but what happens with medical medium

955
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,039
information when you apply it right and

956
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,799
you want to lose weight you can lose

957
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:14,080
weight you get your liver healthy

958
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:14,399
you lose all this unwanted weight and if

959
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,320
you're

960
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:18,320
underweight medical medium information

961
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:21,200
can bring healthy weight back

962
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:25,840
on when it's done correctly and people

963
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,840
are using it correctly

964
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:39,840
i'm chopping up some tomatoes right now

965
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:42,880
i'm gonna read some more comments and

966
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,880
help out the best i can

967
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:54,399
so um

968
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:02,000
because i'm gonna get a couple more

969
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,840
things

970
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:21,839
this is

971
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:35,839
because

972
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,639
see guys um if you just got on here

973
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:43,119
making the bruschetta

974
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:49,839
just some tomatoes got some noodles

975
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:49,839
right here

976
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,359
got it you know what happens with these

977
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:02,960
little tomatoes if you're chopping them

978
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:04,160
you can put them in a food processor and

979
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:08,960
give it a pulse

980
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:08,960
you can do that dr font

981
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:18,240
good to see you on here great md

982
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:18,240
patricia marie good to see you

983
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:23,520
and you can you know one of the things

984
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,240
is you could put i wouldn't put these in

985
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:27,599
a blender

986
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:30,079
i wouldn't do that i wouldn't put

987
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:32,640
i wouldn't put um these cherry tomatoes

988
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:32,640
in a blender

989
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:37,119
because if you put them in a blender

990
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:38,880
they're just going to turn into a soup

991
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:40,320
and you don't want this soup you want

992
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,640
this kind of choppy

993
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:44,480
and cut in pieces okay that's how you

994
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:47,760
want it

995
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:50,640
that's the best way of doing it and

996
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:51,839
if you do i have a garden yeah i love to

997
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,599
grow stuff

998
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:55,440
it's not a big garden or anything but i

999
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:56,480
love to grow stuff whenever i can grow

1000
00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:00,640
tomatoes

1001
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:00,640
grow cucumbers love to do it

1002
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:13,839
but yeah you want to

1003
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:31,200
so i'm gonna answer more questions for

1004
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,200
you guys

1005
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:36,400
ashley kevin

1006
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:41,839
good to see you

1007
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,760
love your videos

1008
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:54,560
these tomatoes are a little extra ripe

1009
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:55,599
which makes them um which makes them

1010
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:57,839
even really nice

1011
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:59,359
they're not over ripe because you know

1012
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:00,800
over ripe tomatoes are the worst you

1013
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:01,839
don't want overripe tomatoes you want to

1014
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,480
overripe anything

1015
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:09,599
where it's like it's going bad but um

1016
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:12,000
these tomatoes here are actually

1017
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:13,599
anne says what juicer do i use for

1018
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,720
celery juice

1019
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:20,839
i use the mm-900

1020
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:23,839
hds so it's by omega

1021
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:24,640
megajuicers.com omega that's the one i

1022
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:26,160
use

1023
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:29,280
it's an incredible juicer it's my

1024
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:33,440
favorite one um

1025
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:33,440
and uh company's great

1026
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:39,680
i love the juicer it really squeak it

1027
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:40,960
it just saves you so much money and

1028
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:43,520
that's the whole point

1029
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:45,280
um you can cut these in four but these

1030
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,920
are so extra ripe i'm cutting them in

1031
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,240
twos

1032
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:49,599
because they're so they're so ripe which

1033
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,960
is gonna make them really good it's

1034
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:52,320
going to make the sauce really good

1035
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,599
because what happens is with tomatoes

1036
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,119
you might get some cherry tomatoes that

1037
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:56,400
aren't really fully ripe and

1038
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:58,240
you buy them and they're really hard

1039
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,599
then you cut them in fours

1040
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:02,880
and that's what you do i'm cutting these

1041
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:04,960
in twos right now so if you guys

1042
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:07,520
you guys want to know because these are

1043
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:09,440
really nice and soft

1044
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:12,160
but they're juicy as heck which is going

1045
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,160
to be really good

1046
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:20,079
why do tomato skins not digest

1047
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:22,720
i see that question don't digest no they

1048
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:22,720
they digest

1049
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:29,680
they do they do your body will it's

1050
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:30,720
tomato skins are fibrous fiber doesn't

1051
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:33,599
digest

1052
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:34,560
but any nutrients around and in the

1053
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:36,960
fiber

1054
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:38,320
digests you just don't know that so when

1055
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,520
it comes out the other end and you're

1056
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,960
like wait a minute why didn't that

1057
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:43,359
tomato skin digest

1058
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:45,119
how come i see that tomato skin in the

1059
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:47,520
bathroom

1060
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:48,800
right how come i see that tomato skin in

1061
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,800
the toilet it's like

1062
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,960
well first of all everything that needed

1063
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,560
to be extracted from that tomato skin

1064
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,880
has been extracted

1065
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:58,400
the rest of that tomato skin which you

1066
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:01,440
can't tell

1067
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:02,240
is actually the the the useless part

1068
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,920
well it's just

1069
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:06,960
fiber like i said you always get plenty

1070
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,960
of fiber in all your foods

1071
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:10,640
much light in love says love you mmm can

1072
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:13,200
you talk about ocd

1073
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:15,839
yeah definitely run that by you a little

1074
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,839
bit so

1075
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:22,079
with ocd okay it's all about metals

1076
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,640
but it's all about metal deposits being

1077
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:24,640
rather

1078
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:26,720
larger that's the other thing on top of

1079
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:29,040
neurons so it's metal deposits being

1080
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:30,640
rather larger on top of neurons and

1081
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,280
they'll sit inside neurons and that's

1082
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:34,720
and i'll

1083
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:36,480
show you what happens is that um

1084
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:38,320
see these little metal deposits right

1085
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,079
here i have on the side of the brain so

1086
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,400
these shiny little aluminum pieces here

1087
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:42,480
right

1088
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:44,880
the deposits aren't that big big this is

1089
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:47,280
just a demonstration model right

1090
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:48,880
and so what happens is as aluminum

1091
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:51,440
collects and mercury collects

1092
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,160
on top of neurons it's kind of magnetic

1093
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:55,200
the more

1094
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:57,119
aluminum you get in your body the more

1095
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:58,720
aluminum goes to the brain to the very

1096
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:00,160
spots that have the aluminum to begin

1097
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,280
with same thing with mercury the more

1098
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:03,839
mercury you have in

1099
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:06,000
deposits on the neurons the more mercury

1100
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:08,319
like if you're eating tuna fish

1101
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,000
if you're doing um maybe some

1102
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:12,720
pharmaceuticals have mercury in it

1103
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,760
whatever it is you get more mercury

1104
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:15,680
added to

1105
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:17,440
the neurons to those little deposits

1106
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:19,040
right and then it depends on where the

1107
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,920
deposits are sitting that creates the

1108
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:22,000
ocd

1109
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:23,359
so deposits are sitting in the emotional

1110
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,920
center of the brain

1111
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:27,839
in those neurons that can be really

1112
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,599
intense that ocd could be much more

1113
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:31,440
intense versus sitting say somewhere in

1114
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:34,000
the left hemisphere right hemisphere

1115
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:34,800
somewhere else off the cuff somewhere uh

1116
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,880
you know

1117
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,000
somewhere in the distance depending on

1118
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,760
where in the tissue

1119
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,200
in the glial cells and so forth but what

1120
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,800
happens is

1121
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,560
you have an electrical impulse and that

1122
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,760
electricity is running so it's running

1123
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:47,920
through the brain right

1124
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:49,200
so you got that all that electricity is

1125
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:51,839
running through that brain

1126
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:53,520
when you think your thoughts okay so

1127
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:55,680
what happens is that's electricity and

1128
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:58,319
guess what that's metal

1129
00:40:55,680 --> 00:41:01,359
electricity metal what happens when

1130
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:03,280
electricity meets metal

1131
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:04,880
okay think about that okay when

1132
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:06,480
electricity hits

1133
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,760
metal you don't want to during a

1134
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,520
lightning storm you don't want to go out

1135
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:11,359
there with like a golf club or something

1136
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:13,040
and stick it up in the air

1137
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:14,640
or you don't want to go out there with

1138
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,920
even an umbrella you don't want to go

1139
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:17,200
out there with anything

1140
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,280
you don't want you don't want to be out

1141
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,960
there with an antenna when there's a

1142
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:23,359
lightning storm

1143
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:24,079
you don't want electricity being drawn

1144
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:27,280
to metal

1145
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:29,119
so what ocd is is electrical impulses

1146
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:30,720
traveling through neurons and it hits a

1147
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:33,200
pocket of metal

1148
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:34,880
and when it hits pressing print said

1149
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,400
your kitchen is so inviting i'm honored

1150
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:39,359
hey glad to have you here

1151
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:41,359
um so when that me when that electricity

1152
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:44,640
hits the metal

1153
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:45,760
it then goes back up the neuron the

1154
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:48,560
other direction

1155
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:49,839
while another but while another

1156
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:52,560
electrical impulse

1157
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:54,319
is coming down that same neuron they hit

1158
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:55,839
each other so what happens is

1159
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:57,200
your electrical impulse is hitting the

1160
00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:58,640
deposits of metal it's hitting the

1161
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,760
aluminum it's hitting the mercury it's

1162
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:01,760
hitting the copper

1163
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,880
mostly aluminum and mercury it comes

1164
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:05,200
down to ocd

1165
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:06,000
and then it hits it and then bounces

1166
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,760
back

1167
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,359
another another electrical impulse is

1168
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:10,880
coming down the same channel

1169
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:12,640
and it's hitting it too it's hitting the

1170
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:15,040
electrical impulse trying to go back up

1171
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:17,200
it's exploding you just got this repeat

1172
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:18,960
we constant repeat it's these electrical

1173
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:20,400
impulses hitting the metal and bouncing

1174
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,000
back up hitting the metal

1175
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:24,000
and that's when the obsessive thoughts

1176
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,599
come in it's like oh my god

1177
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,000
i can't break these thoughts i can't

1178
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:28,720
fall asleep my mind is racing it won't

1179
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,720
stop

1180
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:32,160
all this obsessive thoughts just and

1181
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,599
then those obsessive thoughts can

1182
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:35,839
actually lead to

1183
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:37,680
taking action you know what i mean like

1184
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:39,200
it makes you jump out of bed you get up

1185
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,000
upset you get frustrated now you're

1186
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,520
pacing

1187
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,800
now you're on a phone with a friend now

1188
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,560
you're on the phone with a family member

1189
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:46,480
and you're telling them your obsessive

1190
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:48,720
thoughts and you can't break it

1191
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:50,160
and it gets really difficult and it's

1192
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:53,920
hard to break that

1193
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:56,960
whole frequency um and

1194
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:58,720
it's like it's like i mean i've seen so

1195
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:01,760
many different cases of ocd

1196
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:02,560
and really bad ones terrible ones for so

1197
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,720
many years

1198
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:06,560
and one of the worst ones i've seen i've

1199
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:08,000
seen a lot of bad ones over the last 35

1200
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:11,920
years helping people

1201
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:13,920
is this woman who she needed to check

1202
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:15,839
her body to make sure her head was on

1203
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:17,280
her body it was an obsessive thought she

1204
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:20,560
was perfectly sane

1205
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:21,359
she's a great person and um but she had

1206
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:23,200
she's been

1207
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:25,520
she was at the time she went to like 20

1208
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:28,560
psychiatrists

1209
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:28,880
hundred doctors and it was in and she

1210
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,599
was

1211
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:33,119
really tortured by it and what happened

1212
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:34,720
was she would have to run into him she'd

1213
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:36,160
have to keep a mirror with her 24

1214
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:37,599
7. she'd have to go somewhere with a

1215
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,240
mirror she'd have to go in her car with

1216
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:39,520
the mirror

1217
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,880
she'd have to see the mirror because she

1218
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:42,240
had to make sure her head was attached

1219
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:44,319
to her body

1220
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:46,319
and it became an obsessive thought she

1221
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:48,720
knew her head was attached to her body

1222
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:49,839
she knew of course she did she totally

1223
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:53,520
knew perfectly sane

1224
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:54,720
totally new and but that's not how it

1225
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:58,000
works with ocd

1226
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:58,560
you can know your door is locked you can

1227
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,400
know you

1228
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:01,839
check the stove i know those are the the

1229
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:03,920
basic versions of it

1230
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:05,599
but you you can know your you check the

1231
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:07,440
stove and drive away

1232
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:08,880
and still have to come back and check it

1233
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:11,680
one more time

1234
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:12,800
and i've seen people couldn't even leave

1235
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:14,480
their house they have to

1236
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,599
walk back into the house a hundred times

1237
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:17,520
to check their stove because they're

1238
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:19,520
scared to death it's on right

1239
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:21,440
but that's just those versions this is

1240
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:23,040
another type it's like she had to have a

1241
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,000
mirror with her all the time a compact

1242
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:27,280
she had a

1243
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,960
everywhere she went she had a mirror and

1244
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:30,560
and then there's people who go through

1245
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:32,079
they go through uh

1246
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:33,440
ocd where they just think something bad

1247
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:34,640
is gonna happen to a loved one something

1248
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,839
bad is gonna happen to a friend

1249
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,800
something bad is going to happen to

1250
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:38,079
somebody else

1251
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,359
something bad is going to happen to them

1252
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:41,200
and they can't shake it and they can't

1253
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:41,680
shake it becomes obsessive it devours

1254
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:44,079
them

1255
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:45,359
right there's so many versions of ocd

1256
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:47,119
that i've had to help people with and

1257
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:49,119
everything and it's it's all about what

1258
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:50,000
kind of metal how much metal where it is

1259
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:51,599
in the brain

1260
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,119
how the electrical impulses are hitting

1261
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:54,640
it are they traveling around it are they

1262
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:55,920
hitting it direct are they

1263
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:57,680
bouncing off the other electro

1264
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:59,520
electrical impulses

1265
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:01,440
and that's what ocd is so it's all about

1266
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:02,640
getting the metals out and that's

1267
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:04,560
that's why i've always said you know

1268
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:05,680
it's about the barley grass juice powder

1269
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:07,119
the spirulina

1270
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:08,319
you know the vimergy spirulina of

1271
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:09,440
emergency barley grass juice powder it's

1272
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:11,280
the one i use

1273
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:12,800
it's all about that plus the wild

1274
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:14,480
blueberries and dulce the heavy metal

1275
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:16,480
detox smoothie

1276
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:18,960
about getting those metals out so that

1277
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:21,920
you're free from that

1278
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:25,440
and that's important all right just

1279
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:25,440
going to cut up a few more tomatoes here

1280
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,599
this is such a great dish and it's so

1281
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:32,240
easy

1282
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:32,880
to make i'm just taking my time i mean

1283
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:34,480
honestly

1284
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:47,839
could put these in a food processor and

1285
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:47,839
pulse it but i like chopping them

1286
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:53,040
so i see a question by karen i want to

1287
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:54,319
gain weight as well potatoes don't make

1288
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:56,880
me gain

1289
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:58,240
because there's no fat on them are you

1290
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:00,000
eating enough of them

1291
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:02,079
if you want like if you want to gain

1292
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:06,480
weight

1293
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:08,319
um i mean i have athletes

1294
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:09,520
on potatoes they're they don't do any

1295
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:12,319
fats and they're

1296
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:14,160
they're stoking with muscles all of that

1297
00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:16,319
are you are you using your muscles

1298
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:17,520
so you can gain weight by building a

1299
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:20,480
little bit of muscle

1300
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:22,319
intraskeletal muscles muscles all around

1301
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:23,280

00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:51,839
right there

1458
00:52:02,839 --> 00:52:05,920

00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:08,800
healthier take the fats away for a

1461
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:10,400

00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:18,880
morning flush out that liver

1467
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:20,559

1468
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:21,920
hour later got a nice onion right here

1469
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:25,520
you guys

1470
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:28,559

00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:58,640
and make that the only one if it's beef

1484
00:52:56,319 --> 00:53:00,480
then you have beef for dinner right if

1485
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:02,000
it's chicken have chicken for dinner if

1486
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:03,440
it's nuts and seeds or nut butters

1487
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:06,079
have it later on in the afternoon or

1488
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:07,599
dinner um if it's avocado have your

1489
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:08,480
guacamole at night for dinner start with

1490
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:10,079
that now

1491
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:13,040
if that doesn't cut it your liver is

1492
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:15,599
definitely stagnant and sluggish

1493
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:16,319
so then i would go days without fats i

1494
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:18,640
would go

1495
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:19,520
just complete days with no radical fats

1496
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:22,559
on any level

1497
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:25,520
take radical fats away i would do maybe

1498
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:29,040
the 369 advanced cleanse

1499
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:30,079
369 advanced cleanse or 369 original

1500
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:31,839
cleanse

1501
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:33,839
and i would repeat it pick the one you

1502
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:34,960
want to do the but you can take it as

1503
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:36,400
far as you want to go there's no reason

1504
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:38,319
why you can't lose weight

1505
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:39,359
everybody and anybody can lose unwanted

1506
00:53:38,319 --> 00:53:43,599
weight with the medical medium

1507
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:46,160
information if they actually apply it

1508
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:47,599
i wouldn't do these you're not you're

1509
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:48,079
not going to lose weight easy with these

1510
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:50,720
unless

1511
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:53,040
you've already been eating really bad

1512
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:54,079
processed foods really bad greasy fried

1513
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:55,280
foods or just

1514
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:57,040
chunk of cake or whatever you're eating

1515
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:58,079
and then you go keto and you get rid of

1516
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:59,359
all your processed foods and you're

1517
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:02,000

thank you for my family

1595
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:49,119
lipomas lipomas have a little

1596
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:54,240
tentacle on them so they have a little

1597
00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:56,400
um lipomas actually have a little

1598
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:59,520
those onions are really powerful that

1599
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:59,520
onion i brought in here

1600
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:07,119
god that's a really good one

1601
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:08,640
the power those onions have for actually

1602
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:11,839
killing pathogens

1603
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:13,520
it's a powerful herb really is

1604
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:15,760
i'm going to put a little bit of garlic

1605
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:19,040
in here lipomas have a little

1606
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:23,839
um blood vessel

1607
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:23,839
that comes off of it that blood vessel

1608
00:58:24,799 --> 00:58:31,040
that blood vessel is its feeding

1609
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:34,480
tube so that blood vessel coming off of

1610
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:36,880
its feeding tube so say this is a lipoma

1611
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:37,680
say this egg is a lipoma right and it's

1612
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:39,440
inside of you

1613
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:41,520
people get lipomas in their arms they

1614
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:43,359
get lipomas in their chest

1615
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:45,280
they get them in their stomach they get

1616
00:58:43,359 --> 00:58:46,480
them everywhere i mean they get them in

1617
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:48,400
their legs

1618
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:50,640
they get them on the back of their head

1619
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:53,280
i mean they just get lipomas everywhere

1620
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:55,119
and then there's this little tentacle

1621
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:58,319
that hangs off of light lipoma

1622
00:58:55,119 --> 00:59:00,720
and it looks like this okay

1623
00:58:58,319 --> 00:59:01,760
so you got a lipoma in you and it's got

1624
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:04,319
a little tentacle

1625
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:05,359
coming off of it right and the tentacle

1626
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:08,000
is a blood vessel

1627
00:59:05,359 --> 00:59:08,960
okay angiogenesis right a little blood

1628
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:12,480
vessel

1629
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:12,480
and all of a sudden

1630
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:18,079
you eat a food it really likes like an

1631
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:20,000
egg now that's a lipoma i'm pretending

1632
00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:21,440
it's a lipoma okay not an egg all of a

1633
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,280
sudden you eat an egg

1634
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:24,799
and that egg material finds its way

1635
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:25,839
through the bloodstream stream all the

1636
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:27,520
hormones in the egg

1637
00:59:25,839 --> 00:59:29,119
whether it's organic or not or free

1638
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:30,640
range they find their way in the

1639
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:32,160
bloodstream and the proteins and eggs

1640
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:34,000
find their way and they go up they get

1641
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:35,280
drawn up into that tentacle

1642
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:37,119
and they go right into the lipoma and

1643
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:39,760
the lipoma goes whoa we just

1644
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:41,440
cash we just cashed in some good food we

1645
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:43,440
just got some good food

1646
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:45,119
and that's what they do so then over

1647
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:47,119
time

1648
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:48,640
over time the lipoma grows becomes

1649
00:59:47,119 --> 00:59:51,280
bigger and then you can get multiple

1650
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:52,960
but all of a sudden boom you got two

1651
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:55,200
lipomas

1652
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:57,440
next to each other and one is growing

1653
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:59,520
another tentacle off the other one

1654
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:00,880
the other lipomas actually attached the

1655
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:03,119
other one with a blood vessel

1656
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:04,880
now you got two and they're all nice and

1657
01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:05,920
happy and they're waiting for gluten

1658
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:07,520
they're waiting for eggs

1659
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:09,200
milk cheese butter they're waiting for

1660
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:15,839
toxic heavy metals

1661
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:15,839
they're waiting for anything

1662
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:22,079
some eggs over there okay let's go with

1663
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:22,079
some lemon

1664
01:00:23,359 --> 01:00:27,760
um ask your doctor if you're okay with

1665
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:30,240
higher melatonin higher

1666
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:31,839
higher dosage of melatonin um let me

1667
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:34,400
grab one i think i don't have it right

1668
01:00:31,839 --> 01:00:34,400
here actually

1669
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:39,760
all right well i usually have the

1670
01:00:37,839 --> 01:00:40,799
vimergy melatonin in my cabinet but i

1671
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:43,040
don't right now

1672
01:00:40,799 --> 01:00:44,720
i must have finished it up because it's

1673
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:47,680
it's such a great

1674
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:48,799
great sup incredible quality but anyway

1675
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:51,200
melatonin

1676
01:00:48,799 --> 01:00:53,839
ask your doctor if he's okay or she's

1677
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:56,960
okay if you start doing melatonin

1678
01:00:53,839 --> 01:00:58,480
or melatonin at a high dosage like ask

1679
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:59,359
your doctor if 20 milligrams of

1680
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:01,839
melatonin

1681
01:00:59,359 --> 01:01:03,760
is right for you because or 10

1682
01:01:01,839 --> 01:01:06,480
milligrams or

1683
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:07,680
5 milligrams or more and what melatonin

1684
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:11,119
does

1685
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:14,319
is it inhibits lipomas from growing

1686
01:01:11,119 --> 01:01:16,240
so it's phytochemical compounds in

1687
01:01:14,319 --> 01:01:17,280
melatonin that end up going into the

1688
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:19,920
lipoma

1689
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:22,720
right they go into the lipoma and then

1690
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:24,559
the lipoma can't grow

1691
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:26,000
it doesn't have the ability to grow so

1692
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:28,079
it stays the size because that's the key

1693
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:30,799
i've always told people with lipomas

1694
01:01:28,079 --> 01:01:32,400
you want them to stay the size they are

1695
01:01:30,799 --> 01:01:34,880
or shrink

1696
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:37,280
and you can you can get lipomas down if

1697
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:38,000
you really keep that diet clean and

1698
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:39,599
you're doing the right

1699
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:41,200
supps and you get metals out of your

1700
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:43,760
lipoma because what happens is when your

1701
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:46,480
lipoma

1702
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:48,400
when your lipomas starts to absorb

1703
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:50,559
things like spirulina

1704
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:52,400
barley grass juice powder the wild

1705
01:01:50,559 --> 01:01:54,319
blueberries when it starts to absorb the

1706
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:56,720
heavy metal detox smoothie

1707
01:01:54,319 --> 01:01:58,559
and it goes into the lipoma then that

1708
01:01:56,720 --> 01:02:01,119
heavy metal detox movie starts to grab

1709
01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:03,440
onto metals in that lipoma

1710
01:02:01,119 --> 01:02:05,599
and draws them out and so your lipoma

1711
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:07,280
doesn't have metals in it anymore

1712
01:02:05,599 --> 01:02:11,839
because metals help life homeless to

1713
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:11,839
grow too what is the 369 cleanse

fat doesn't make you fat it does brianna

1731
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:12,799
it does when your liver says i had

1732
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:17,839
enough

1733
01:03:12,799 --> 01:03:17,839
fat will make you fat

1734
01:03:18,079 --> 01:03:21,680
that's what happens that's why people

1735
01:03:20,079 --> 01:03:24,799
who go keto gain weight

1736
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:26,400
later because their liver had enough i'm

1737
01:03:24,799 --> 01:03:27,440
not saying keto is the worst thing to do

1738
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:28,960
it's actually a good

1739
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:30,480
it's a good starting point for a lot of

1740
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:31,200
people because it gets you off processed

1741
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:33,359
food i'm not

1742
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:34,240
ripping into it like it's bad or

1743
01:03:33,359 --> 01:03:36,640
something

1744
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:38,319
you can be plant-based in keto okay you

1745
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:40,000
can be plant-based in keto you can be

1746
01:03:38,319 --> 01:03:41,680
animal protein in keto and it gets you

1747
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:43,839
at least off of processed foods and

1748
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:45,440
gluten and all that and you can start

1749
01:03:43,839 --> 01:03:46,160
even losing some weight for a lot of

1750
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:47,599
people

1751
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:51,520
but it but there's a lot of people that

1752
01:03:47,599 --> 01:03:53,920
can't so what happens is that

1753
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:55,280
fat made me fat and kept me fat alison

1754
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:58,559
says yeah

1755
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:59,200
fat makes you fat radical fats make you

1756
01:03:58,559 --> 01:04:01,200
fat

1757
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:02,799
it just depends are you young if you're

1758
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:06,000
really young and your liver isn't

1759
01:04:02,799 --> 01:04:07,680
toasted yet then you know if you're

1760
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:09,680
really young and your liver isn't

1761
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:11,760
burnt out yet you're not going to get

1762
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:12,000
fat eating fat yet but you're gonna get

1763
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:13,920
fat

1764
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:15,599
eating fat eventually no matter what it

1765
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:17,359
gets everybody okay

1766
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:18,960
so if you're 21 years old you're 22

1767
01:04:17,359 --> 01:04:20,079
years old and fat hasn't made you fat

1768
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:21,760
yet it's going to make you fat when

1769
01:04:20,079 --> 01:04:23,359
you're 45 years old

1770
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:25,119
and doesn't rely doesn't your doesn't

1771
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:26,240
your life matter doesn't your life count

1772
01:04:25,119 --> 01:04:27,520
it's going to make you fat when you're

1773
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:28,799
52 years old

1774
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:30,160
it's gonna make you fat when you're 60

1775
01:04:28,799 --> 01:04:31,200
years old it's gonna make you fat

1776
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:32,400
someday and it's gonna

1777
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:35,119
somewhere along the line you're gonna

1778
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:36,799
get fat from fat

1779
01:04:35,119 --> 01:04:38,079
the question is that everybody always

1780
01:04:36,799 --> 01:04:39,280
says which i just saw the question here

1781
01:04:38,079 --> 01:04:42,559
doesn't your fat

1782
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:43,599
doesn't your brain need fat um that's

1783
01:04:42,559 --> 01:04:46,000
interesting because your brain's not

1784
01:04:43,599 --> 01:04:49,039
made out of fat

1785
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:50,720
your brain is made out of glycogen and

1786
01:04:49,039 --> 01:04:52,640
the more fat you eat and the less

1787
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:54,799
carbohydrate you eat

1788
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:56,160
and the less fruits and the less and the

1789
01:04:54,799 --> 01:04:58,640
less um

1790
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:59,599
potatoes and and sweet potatoes and

1791
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:02,960
winter squash

1792
01:04:59,599 --> 01:05:05,680
and the less of those things you eat um

1793
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:06,720
your your brain starts to starve starve

1794
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:08,960
with glycogen

1795
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:11,839
and then your brain shrinks everybody's

1796
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:13,680
brain shrinks

1797
01:05:11,839 --> 01:05:15,920
everybody i was talking to a

1798
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:19,119
neurosurgeon last month about this

1799
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:22,799
he says he says he's seen it his whole

1800
01:05:19,119 --> 01:05:27,440
life as a neurosurgeon everybody's

1801
01:05:22,799 --> 01:05:27,440
brain everybody's brain shrinks

1802
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:34,319
he was asking me why

1803
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:36,720
he was asking me why does everybody's

1804
01:05:34,319 --> 01:05:40,319
brain shrink

1805
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:42,960
i said because it's a glucose glycogen

1806
01:05:40,319 --> 01:05:44,240
deprivation for too many years and you

1807
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:46,720
get older and your brain starts to

1808
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:48,240
atrophy it's called brain atrophy

1809
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:49,839
and just so you know your brain is not

1810
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:51,599
made out of fat it's made out of sugar

1811
01:05:49,839 --> 01:05:52,799
it's made out of storage glycogen which

1812
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:54,400
is sugar okay

1813
01:05:52,799 --> 01:05:55,920
that's what your brain's made out of is

1814
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:56,880
there fat in your brain yeah but there's

1815
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:59,680
traces of fat

1816
01:05:56,880 --> 01:06:01,280
throughout your entire body everywhere

1817
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:03,039
in your body there's there's a trace of

1818
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:04,400
fat in every part of your body omega-3

1819
01:06:03,039 --> 01:06:07,839
and squalene and all that

1820
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:10,880
it's everywhere in the body right but

1821
01:06:07,839 --> 01:06:12,720
um then there's traces of fat in every

1822
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:14,160
single food and these cucumber noodles

1823
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:16,319
right here and that basil sitting in

1824
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:18,160
front of me and these tomatoes right

1825
01:06:16,319 --> 01:06:19,760
and i'm not against healthy fats if you

1826
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:21,200
want healthy fats but the point is is

1827
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:24,319
your brain

1828
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:25,440
doesn't need fat it needs sugar you run

1829
01:06:24,319 --> 01:06:28,400
on sugar your brain

1830
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:29,119
thinks with sugar glucose is how this

1831
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:32,880
runs

1832
01:06:29,119 --> 01:06:35,520
it's glucose take your sugar okay

1833
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:37,039
this is funny okay when you go to the

1834
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:40,160
doctor for a checkup

1835
01:06:37,039 --> 01:06:43,839
are they checking your blood fat

1836
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:45,680
no they're not if that was so important

1837
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:47,119
i'm scratching my head here

1838
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:48,720
if that was so important wouldn't they

1839
01:06:47,119 --> 01:06:51,119
be checking your blood fat

1840
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:52,880
they don't care about that they just

1841
01:06:51,119 --> 01:06:54,799
care about your blood sugar

1842
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:56,799
because guess what happens without blood

1843
01:06:54,799 --> 01:06:58,839
sugar guess what happens without glucose

1844
01:06:56,799 --> 01:07:03,520
to your cells you die

1845
01:06:58,839 --> 01:07:06,400
yeah we we as a human race human species

1846
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:07,440
sugar's so critical your brain won't run

1847
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:10,000
it won't even

1848
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:10,720
it won't run it won't even work without

1849
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,640
sugar

1850
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:15,839
does your brain need fat no it needs

1851
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:15,839
sugar or you're dead

1852
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:20,559
if your brain doesn't get sugar your

1853
01:07:18,079 --> 01:07:24,720
brain can't exist anymore

1854
01:07:20,559 --> 01:07:27,760
if your brain doesn't get fat it exists

1855
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:29,440
you can live without radical fat

1856
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:31,039
overt fat whatever you want to call it

1857
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:32,240
you can live without fats your whole

1858
01:07:31,039 --> 01:07:33,680
life

1859
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:36,160
because there's fats in everything you

1860
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:37,520
eat anyway and your brain doesn't rely

1861
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:41,200
on fat

1862
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:43,440
you can't live without sugar

1863
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:45,280
in some form shape or some way even if

1864
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:46,400
you eat red meat there's sugar in the

1865
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:48,000
blood of the meat

1866
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:50,640
and it's caramelized when you cook it

1867
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:52,400
it's in there blood sugar animals blood

1868
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:53,359
sugar animals blood inside the meat is

1869
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:56,079
blood sugar

1870
01:07:53,359 --> 01:07:57,280
and no matter what your brain has to

1871
01:07:56,079 --> 01:07:59,440
have sugar or

1872
01:07:57,280 --> 01:08:00,480
you don't exist anymore and that's why

1873
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:02,720
blood sugar is so

1874
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:03,920
critical that's why they've been testing

1875
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:07,119
it checking for it's

1876
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:09,440
all of this so

1877
01:08:07,119 --> 01:08:10,400
and everyone's on caffeine which is fake

1878
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:12,160
energy

1879
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:13,440
to keep them energetic while they're on

1880
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:15,520
their high fat diets

1881
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:17,759
it's like stay on your high fat diet

1882
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:18,880
avoid all sugars avoid all fruit avoid

1883
01:08:17,759 --> 01:08:20,960
all potatoes

1884
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:22,719
stay on your high fat diet and then use

1885
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:24,239
caffeine for fake energy i mean that's

1886
01:08:22,719 --> 01:08:26,080
what people do when really

1887
01:08:24,239 --> 01:08:27,679
the brain starts to atrophy caffeine

1888
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:29,040
causes atrophy in everybody's brain it's

1889
01:08:27,679 --> 01:08:30,640
like

1890
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:32,400
got all these people all these elders

1891
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:33,600
all these people that are getting older

1892
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:35,440
their brain's atrophying they're

1893
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:36,719
drinking caffeine their whole life

1894
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:38,640
they're not getting enough sugar to

1895
01:08:36,719 --> 01:08:40,239
their brain they're getting insulin

1896
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:41,679
resistant so they can't even get sugar

1897
01:08:40,239 --> 01:08:43,359
to the brain and they're just wasting

1898
01:08:41,679 --> 01:08:45,440
away and you just age fast and

1899
01:08:43,359 --> 01:08:53,839
everything else

1900
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:53,839
you know i mean

1901
01:08:55,920 --> 01:09:01,040
and a lot of people crave sugar because

1902
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:03,759
they're really craving like

1903
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:05,279
glucose that's what it is their brains

1904
01:09:03,759 --> 01:09:06,000
craving glucose and a lot of people

1905
01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:08,480
crave salt

1906
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:09,120
because they're craving trace minerals

1907
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:12,239
which is

1908
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:12,239
trace mineral salts

1909
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:16,719
smells so good right here you've got the

1910
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:18,159
garlic in here got the basil

1911
01:09:16,719 --> 01:09:20,239
you don't need a lot of basil i mean

1912
01:09:18,159 --> 01:09:22,480
basil's anti-pathogen which is

1913
01:09:20,239 --> 01:09:25,600
incredible but

1914
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:26,480
it's so good and i'm gonna put this on

1915
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:29,279
top

1916
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:29,279
of the noodles

1917
01:09:30,719 --> 01:09:33,359
but you know what you guys you're gonna

1918
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:35,279
get a lot of misinformation out there

1919
01:09:33,359 --> 01:09:36,719
and it's painstaking because yeah you

1920
01:09:35,279 --> 01:09:38,239
might be somebody that it really doesn't

1921
01:09:36,719 --> 01:09:39,839
affect right now but

1922
01:09:38,239 --> 01:09:41,679
you can take that misinformation and be

1923
01:09:39,839 --> 01:09:43,199
like your brain needs fat let me just go

1924
01:09:41,679 --> 01:09:44,880
with that because every single podcast

1925
01:09:43,199 --> 01:09:45,920
doctor's saying your brain needs fat

1926
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:47,679
because everybody's saying your brain

1927
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:51,279
needs fat they don't they don't they're

1928
01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:52,960
wrong i mean it's not how it works

1929
01:09:51,279 --> 01:09:54,719
your brain actually runs on sugar it's

1930
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:56,000
made out of glycogen and it needs sugar

1931
01:09:54,719 --> 01:09:57,760
you can't make a thought together put a

1932
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:59,360
thought together

1933
01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:00,880
glucose is part of how your electrical

1934
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:02,640
activity even works how

1935
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:04,239
electrical activity in the brain all

1936
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:07,679
that neurotransmitters even work it's

1937
01:10:04,239 --> 01:10:07,679
all it's all glucose based

1938
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:18,000
that onion was so strong that onion was

1939
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:18,000
strong um

1940
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:24,480
grabbing a fork here so i'm just going

1941
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:24,480
to mix this up a little bit

1942
01:10:26,239 --> 01:10:31,440
so i got the cucumber noodles i got the

1943
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:34,800
tomato bruschetta on top here

1944
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:35,120
okay that's what i have now yeah i mean

1945
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:36,880
look

1946
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:38,400
if you if you're into fat and that's all

1947
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:39,760
you want to eat or something like that i

1948
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:41,120
still want you to make these healthy

1949
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:42,560
meals if you needed to put a little

1950
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:44,080
avocado on it because you're not going

1951
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:45,600
to have it any other way

1952
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:47,440
at least i know you got something really

1953
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:49,280
healthy in in you with that

1954
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:50,719
but i would try to keep a fat free meal

1955
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:55,440
once in a while in your life maybe

1956
01:10:50,719 --> 01:10:57,280
in a day or something when you're sick

1957
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:58,880
you'll feel how fat doesn't help you

1958
01:10:57,280 --> 01:11:01,199
when you're really sick

1959
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:02,000
that's when the line is is crossed or

1960
01:11:01,199 --> 01:11:04,880
that's when you

1961
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:06,000
figure it out it's like it's like why do

1962
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:06,640
you think everybody's intermittent

1963
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,840
fasting

1964
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:10,320
they're intermittent fasting because

1965
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:11,920
they they didn't know it

1966
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:13,520
no one knows it not even so-called

1967
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:15,760
intermittent fasting experts whatever

1968
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:18,159
you call that or whoever

1969
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:19,679
it they didn't know that you're taking

1970
01:11:18,159 --> 01:11:21,199
fats out of your diet in the morning

1971
01:11:19,679 --> 01:11:22,719
that's why but they don't say that

1972
01:11:21,199 --> 01:11:24,400
because they think fats mean everything

1973
01:11:22,719 --> 01:11:26,239
it's like you need fats

1974
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:27,440
but they but when you take your fats out

1975
01:11:26,239 --> 01:11:29,040
in the morning

1976
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:30,800

just gave everything a break

1979
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:36,000
because the fats in the morning that

1980
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:38,719
actually they kill you

1981
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:40,159

1982
01:11:38,719 --> 01:11:41,440
