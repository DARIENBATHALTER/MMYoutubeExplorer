1
00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:05,069
the medical medium how is everybody out

2
00:00:02,429 --> 00:00:07,830
there I have Elizabeth Schaaf Roth right

3
00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:09,300
here with me she's an old friend and we

4
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:12,900
didn't originally start out that way you

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:14,309
came to me 10 years ago but liz is an

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,529
amazing person she's here to tell her

7
00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:19,380
story about Lyme disease about how she

8
00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:21,480
struggled and suffered as a young woman

9
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:23,310
because it's just it's really hard when

10
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:26,010
it's when it's at that age especially

11
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:29,400
and we're here she's a dear dear friend

12
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:31,410
I'm really really lucky that I got her

13
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,239
here right now with everything and and

14
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:35,190
she's here she's gonna help out so many

15
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:36,780
people because it's important to know

16
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:38,640
about Lyme disease it's important to

17
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,840
know about the truth about it about what

18
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,170
people go through

19
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,960
she has history that is it's priceless

20
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:47,219
this history because you know it's

21
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,770
different when you're diagnosed with

22
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:52,920
Lyme disease today a lot different than

23
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:55,949
it was 10 years ago 11 years ago 12

24
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,289
years ago and I mean it's the dark ages

25
00:00:55,949 --> 00:01:02,010
now with Lyme disease it was the dark

26
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:04,409
ages 10 12 years ago for real like even

27
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:06,390
more so because there wasn't any any

28
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:07,740
kind of I mean it wasn't even any kind

29
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:09,240
of hope because science research didn't

30
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:14,549
know laughs anyway have Elizabeth here

31
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:16,740
I'm so happy thank you for coming on I'm

32
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:21,720
so grateful you Anthony

33
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:24,900
saved my life Anthony is unique from my

34
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:27,600
personal experience I mean he shows

35
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:29,549
unconditional love to people which I

36
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,700
find was very hard to find in my

37
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:36,990
experience with professionals and

38
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:40,140
practitioners and he actually really

39
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:43,409
cares about the person each individual

40
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:45,329
each person and that is what compelled

41
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:47,970
me to Anthony and from the first time I

42
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:51,990
spoke to him on the on the phone I knew

43
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:55,710
that he was someone that actually cared

44
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:57,750
and didn't just you know just wasn't in

45
00:01:55,710 --> 00:02:00,630
it just was following a book or

46
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:03,360
following a set of rules no Anthony has

47
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:07,009
and he has the research to back it up

48
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:10,170
and so I just want to thank Anthony for

49
00:02:07,009 --> 00:02:13,290
coming into my life I never you know I

50
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:15,330
never saw it happening I just one day

51
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:17,280
stumbled upon Anthony and he has changed

52
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:20,250
my life think was a health food store -

53
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,590
and it was like 2010 probably right

54
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:24,510
right around that time so we're coming

55
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:27,239
on ten years I think so that's what

56
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:30,420
we're doing and but it's it's great to

57
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:34,140
see you the vibrant and here and alive

58
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:37,200
and well and safe and you know and I

59
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:38,909
always I mean I think what were you 23

60
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:43,109
when you came when you came to me

61
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:48,150
originally so I was around 21 when I

62
00:02:43,109 --> 00:02:50,549
began having symptoms I was in college

63
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:53,849
it was my third year of college and I

64
00:02:50,549 --> 00:02:57,629
woke up one day and I felt like a

65
00:02:53,849 --> 00:03:01,590
different person I was not the person

66
00:02:57,629 --> 00:03:04,079
that I was I had no energy no physical

67
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:05,639
energy Coffee stopped working

68
00:03:04,079 --> 00:03:07,170
look I would have coffee every day and

69
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:10,170
it would cut me up and make me feel

70
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:11,519
great and it didn't happen - that

71
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:13,500
happens at people when they're starting

72
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,450
to get sick coffee's not cutting it or

73
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,099
they need their coffee no matter what

74
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:18,959
because they have something underlying

75
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:20,609
and they just don't nobody knows about

76
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,319
it yet and years could be where they

77
00:03:20,609 --> 00:03:23,910
have to have their coffee to function I

78
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,250
want to talk about it later too because

79
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:28,709
people like it's like why do you need

80
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:30,780
your coffee to function I mean that

81
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:32,340
means something's going on you know but

82
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,819
you so the coffee just didn't cut it

83
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:36,419
anymore

84
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:38,730
I was so unwell that I just had no

85
00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:41,010
energy I had no physical energy I no

86
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:44,310
mental energy and I had no idea what was

87
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:46,260
going on with me and I had to I couldn't

88
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:49,799
go to class I stopped attending classes

89
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:51,329
I had no energy I couldn't I I had no

90
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:53,609
idea what was going on so you're in

91
00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:55,349
college I'm in college you're not able

92
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:57,359
to attend classes is that a big deal

93
00:03:55,349 --> 00:04:01,190
like that's a big deal right for a young

94
00:03:57,359 --> 00:04:04,409
woman you can't attend classes I can't

95
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:06,329

97
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:11,370
bad I don't have energy I don't feel

98
00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:13,790
like myself I I'm like just it's so hard

99
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:17,039
to get through the day and unfortunately

100
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:19,500
I had to leave school in my third year

101
00:04:17,039 --> 00:04:20,909

102
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,740

York City which I'm originally from and

104
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:31,030
that's when I started going to doctors

105
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:33,130
to 40 doctors over the course of like so

106
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:36,220
six years so it's like so it's like

107
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:39,190

when you came to me ten years ago you

116
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:59,050

117
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:01,479
people's lives but nobody talked about

118
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:03,610
it they still don't talk about it I just

119
00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:05,110
did a recent podcast recently and I'm

120
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:07,570
just sitting there talking about this

121
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:10,810
stuff and people they look like deer in

122
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:12,940
headlights like you know young women are

123
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:14,710
really struggling with these conditions

00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:15,280
no one talks about that like okay life

125
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:18,130

130
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:27,849
choice like so I just this is my life I

131
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:30,280
have to go to doctors appointments I

132
00:05:27,849 --> 00:05:32,380
can't go to class I can't study I have

133
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,990
to know I have to get better I had no

134
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:37,780
other choice but to get better and

135
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:40,060
doctors did not know no one knew what

136
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:43,470
was going on with me I tried everything

137
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:45,699
I tried every pill every treatment

138
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:48,340
everything that I could find in regular

139
00:05:45,699 --> 00:05:52,300
conventional medicine and nothing helped

140
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:54,669
me nothing with the doctors that you

141
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:57,729
know I was going to and then one day a

142
00:05:54,669 --> 00:06:00,070
friend said why don't you go to a Lyme

143
00:05:57,729 --> 00:06:03,190
specialist a Lyme disease specialist and

144
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:07,270
so I went to a Lyme disease specialist

145
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:10,960
and they diagnosed me with Lyme disease

146
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:13,930
and they said I had neuropsychiatric

147
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,699
Lyme disease and which is when what

148
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:18,909
which is when Lyme disease they believe

149
00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:25,479
is affecting your mood or your life or

150
00:06:18,909 --> 00:06:27,310
your your attitude your anxiety I was

151
00:06:25,479 --> 00:06:29,860
having brain fog you haven't the brain

152
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:31,030
fog I was like brain fog is you know

153
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:34,060
when you're just if you feel kind of

154
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:35,710
spaced out and you don't know why you

155
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:39,070
just you feel spaced out you don't

156
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:41,770
really feel like yourself and rain

157
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:43,660
brain fog is debilitating brain fog can

158
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:46,420
literally stop people from functioning

159
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:48,220
getting sentences out or being able to

160
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:50,650
articulate be able to converse with

161
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:52,780
people brain fog is brutal except people

162
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:54,400
from working but I mean here you are 21

163
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:58,540
years old you're dealing with severe

164
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:59,920
brain fog and you're you're highly

165
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:04,240
intelligent you're a highly intelligent

166
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:06,430
person you're extremely sharp I've known

167
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:09,400
you for 10 years your brilliant mind a

168
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:11,470
brilliant person and and actually have

169
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:14,080
to deal with that brain fog like that is

170
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:20,920
brutal so so they diagnosed you with

171
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:22,510
psychiatric Lyme aspects can don't quote

172
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:26,040
me on it but a scan of my brain they

173
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:28,900
said I had global brain inflammation and

174
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:32,230
then I started the antibiotics and I

175
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:35,860
started intravenous antibiotics I had a

176
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:39,520
PICC line in my arm I was being you know

177
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:42,640
everyday infused with antibiotics and it

178
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:44,920
wasn't doing much of anything and I just

179
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:47,080
believed in it I said it so it's got to

180
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:50,770
get better I know it's the Lyme disease

181
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:54,700
and then this was like years later so by

182
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:58,600
now I'm in my mid to late 20s and I'm

183
00:07:54,700 --> 00:08:00,880
still struggling and I was one night I

184
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:03,520
was in in a restaurant in New York City

185
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:05,590
called Angelica's kitchen and I was

186
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:08,080
leaving the restaurant and I see this

187
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:09,730
magazine this health magazine and I'm

188
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:14,500
skimming through it and I see Anthony

189
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:16,120
and I'm like I felt an urge to call him

190
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:18,760
I can't even describe what I felt that

191
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:21,730
night out of nowhere I needed to call

192
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:24,490
Anthony and I haven't know I had to call

193
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:25,840
you like it was so weird like I don't go

194
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:27,750
around calling people in health

195
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:31,000
magazines it's not it's not my day today

196
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:34,150
so I mean I go to these I go to some

197
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,160
doctors but anyway the it was amazing so

198
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:38,710
I called him and I was I remember it was

199
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:41,890
11 p.m. at night I was standing in bet

200
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:44,410
Best Buy in New York City and Anthony

201
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:46,120
called me back immediately and I told

202
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:48,160
him what was going on which is something

203
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:50,350
that doesn't happen that's another thing

204
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,160
I have to wait months and months and

205
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:52,509
months

206
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:56,019
waiting list to get to see a line

207
00:08:52,509 --> 00:08:58,360
specialist for a year why so you can for

208
00:08:56,019 --> 00:09:00,399
what and you know and even me it was

209
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:02,649
hard to get back to people fast I mean

210
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,810
our office got back to people as quick

211
00:09:02,649 --> 00:09:06,610
as we could like immediately and I

212
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:08,290
worked I worked day and night I mean I

213
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:10,329
got four hours of sleep at night for

214
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:11,680
seven days a week for a member like six

215
00:09:10,329 --> 00:09:13,870
or eight years straight without a half

216
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,660
day off or a holiday but I remember when

217
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:25,750
I got a hold of you you were surprised

218
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:28,839
you were like what what's going on it's

219
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:31,060
just funny and he basically said to me

220
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:33,250
he said to me that you don't have Lyme

221
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:35,889
disease I said what do you mean I don't

222
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:38,860
have Lyme disease yes I do I thought I

223
00:09:35,889 --> 00:09:41,019
did he goes no and I believed him I was

224
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:45,250
like you're right I don't have Lyme

225
00:09:41,019 --> 00:09:47,829
disease that's false yeah because I mean

226
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:49,569
you didn't get bit by a tick no I warned

227
00:09:47,829 --> 00:09:51,430
I didn't have any recollection of a tick

228
00:09:49,569 --> 00:09:54,220
bite which is unbelievable some people

229
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:55,689
do but even then you know still not Lyme

230
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:57,550
because you guys are learning about Lyme

231
00:09:55,689 --> 00:09:58,990
now what's happening and everything

232
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:00,910
anybody who doesn't know about the

233
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:03,480
medical medium information Lyme disease

234
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:05,769
has now moved out of the category of

235
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,569
bacterial now so medical medium

236
00:10:05,769 --> 00:10:09,610
information allowed that to happen

237
00:10:07,569 --> 00:10:11,139
actually prompted and pushed the medical

238
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:12,759
industry to change it they changed it

239
00:10:11,139 --> 00:10:14,139
because of the millions of books that

240
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:15,699
got the truth out about Lyme disease

241
00:10:14,139 --> 00:10:17,319
Lyme disease is not bacterial if you're

242
00:10:15,699 --> 00:10:18,970
still stuck in that bacterium minded

243
00:10:17,319 --> 00:10:20,500
world of Lyme disease you're gonna be

244
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:22,360
held back from getting better and it's

245
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,620
gonna hold you back for a lifetime if

246
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,720
you're not careful because it's not

247
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:27,160
bacteria and the Lyme labs

248
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,389
they've been bankrolling off of this

249
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,759
because this is what they built their

250
00:10:28,389 --> 00:10:32,800
empires on they know to so what's

251
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:34,480
happening is is is the world's changing

252
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,339
now it's put in autoimmune so Lyme

253
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,720
disease the medical industry took Lyme

254
00:10:36,339 --> 00:10:39,939
disease and they put it in autoimmune

255
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,800
now which means they think the body is

256
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:44,290
attacking itself and it wasn't bacteria

257
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:45,550
so just so you know and with her when

258
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:47,649
she came to me with all these symptoms

259
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:49,839
and everything else and and all of that

260
00:10:47,649 --> 00:10:51,910
it wasn't Lyme disease it just wasn't

261
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,259
you can call it that you can call it

262
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:55,750
Lyme disease you can name it anything

263
00:10:53,259 --> 00:10:58,569
you want but it wasn't what was really

264
00:10:55,750 --> 00:11:00,519
happening and you know and I and I new

265
00:10:58,569 --> 00:11:00,880
to with you that you weren't bit by a

266
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:02,470
tick

267
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,970
and even when you're bit by a tick it

268
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:05,259
doesn't mean that's Lyme disease and

269
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:06,459
I got it you know the whole thing I

270
00:11:05,259 --> 00:11:07,839
remember we talked about it and

271
00:11:06,459 --> 00:11:09,939
everything I mean did you have a relief

272
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,980
like a feeling of relief though oh I had

273
00:11:09,939 --> 00:11:14,949
a huge sense of relief because someone

274
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:17,319
was actually you know I believed him

275
00:11:14,949 --> 00:11:18,339
completely and he said that it was

276
00:11:17,319 --> 00:11:21,100
something else

277
00:11:18,339 --> 00:11:23,560
Anthony told me that it was heavy metals

278
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:25,839
and it was viral and that I had

279
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:29,170
inflammation going on and that we had to

280
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:31,329
address those factors and no one really

281
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:35,110
would ever address what was actually

282
00:11:31,329 --> 00:11:36,850
going on with with the underlying you

283
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:39,850
know the issue and I didn't know what it

284
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:42,339
was yeah because for brain fog to happen

285
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:43,509
you got to have mercury got to have

286
00:11:42,339 --> 00:11:45,699
toxic heavy metals like mercury

287
00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:47,110
everybody's got mercury in in them and

288
00:11:45,699 --> 00:11:49,029
if you guys don't think you have mercury

289
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:51,939
in you it's not true you have mercury in

290
00:11:49,029 --> 00:11:54,339
you and and our ancestors do forefathers

291
00:11:51,939 --> 00:11:56,019
down the line all had mercury in them

292
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:58,060
and mercury you know and what's

293
00:11:56,019 --> 00:11:59,829
happening now is young women are getting

294
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:03,100
more sensitive to toxic heavy metals

295
00:11:59,829 --> 00:12:05,680
than ever before in our history and it's

296
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:12,160
a cumulative effect to that's happening

297
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:13,990
yeah and aluminum are not good obviously

298
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:17,110
and they're you know they're neurotoxin

299
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:18,939
and you know if you get enough mercury

300
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:20,970
in enough aluminum and your body is

301
00:12:18,939 --> 00:12:24,250
sensitive force whatever Prieta

302
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:26,529
predisposition you may have it's gonna

303
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:29,110
trigger something and it's gonna set off

304
00:12:26,529 --> 00:12:31,120
a stream of things that that is not you

305
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:34,870
and you need to start looking at what

306
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:36,129
actually is going on what's causing you

307
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:39,309
know you got to start getting those

308
00:12:36,129 --> 00:12:41,529
heavy metal metals out of you and slowly

309
00:12:39,309 --> 00:12:43,269
obviously and you talk about that so

310
00:12:41,529 --> 00:12:44,680
what happened we had the PICC line you

311
00:12:43,269 --> 00:12:48,189
were getting me antibiotics were you

312
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:49,509
getting better no so the antibiotics

313
00:12:48,189 --> 00:12:51,430
weren't getting him better and that's a

314
00:12:49,509 --> 00:12:52,990
thing with Lyme disease because so you

315
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:53,980
weren't you were you feeling sicker from

316
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:59,170
the antibiotics

317
00:12:53,980 --> 00:13:00,730
I actually was feeling I was feeling a

318
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:03,870
little bit yeah I was feeling sicker but

319
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:05,949
I was feeling no different at all and

320
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:08,860
you know I think that if I stayed I

321
00:13:05,949 --> 00:13:10,600
stayed on them and many much longer it

322
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:13,540
could have been to the point where I

323
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:15,759
could get I could have gone very sick

324
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:16,779
yeah why did you stop them like what was

325
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:17,800
it because we talked to her you just

326
00:13:16,779 --> 00:13:20,620
knew your

327
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:24,519
it wasn't working and no because I spoke

328
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:26,009
to you and you explained it in a

329
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:28,509
different way I think I probably

330
00:13:26,009 --> 00:13:30,940
probably told you and I can't remember

331
00:13:28,509 --> 00:13:32,680
but I probably told you if you stand the

332
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:35,980
antibiotics you're gonna go down the

333
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:37,839
path when I watch 30 years of people

334
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:39,670
diagnosed with Lyme disease getting

335
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:41,560
bombarded with antibiotics and losing

336
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:43,779
their lives and I know you were young

337
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:45,939
and you just started them and I was like

338
00:13:43,779 --> 00:13:49,180
in this situation you're you're just

339
00:13:45,939 --> 00:13:52,269
gonna end up like the rest we can't let

340
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:54,910
that happen I think I was probably you

341
00:13:52,269 --> 00:13:56,319
know really really charged about it

342
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:57,850
because it was like wait a minute

343
00:13:56,319 --> 00:13:59,199
you know how old are you I just don't

344
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:01,360
want to see you go through this now

345
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:04,769
because that's what happens because we

346
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:08,740
had thousands of people contact us women

347
00:14:04,769 --> 00:14:11,410
that were already down that the dark

348
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:13,209
place of tons of antibiotics and their

349
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:15,189
lives were shattered because of it

350
00:14:13,209 --> 00:14:17,529
because they weren't properly diagnosed

351
00:14:15,189 --> 00:14:20,259
about they weren't properly diagnosed

352
00:14:17,529 --> 00:14:22,240
about the viral issue they had the

353
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:23,769
epstein-barr they had or anything else

354
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,300
and they and they weren't properly

355
00:14:23,769 --> 00:14:28,089
diagnosed with the toxic heavy metals

356
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:32,139
and their lives were shattered by this

357
00:14:28,089 --> 00:14:35,439
phantom bacterial thing which here's the

358
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:38,649
thing Lyme bacteria is not a super bug

359
00:14:35,439 --> 00:14:40,750
it kills off easy from from from

360
00:14:38,649 --> 00:14:42,880
antibiotics it's not it's not MRSA

361
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:44,860
people actually heal from Mercer with

362
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:47,769
antibiotics and Merces antibiotic

363
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:49,420
resistant and people recover I've seen

364
00:14:47,769 --> 00:14:50,800
people go in the hospital tumors to come

365
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:53,259
out of hospital they recover because

366
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:57,910
Merce is a super bug but it has a higher

367
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:59,769
healing rate than Borrelia Babesia it's

368
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:02,290
unbelievable then Bartonella it's

369
00:14:59,769 --> 00:15:03,730
unbelievable so what happens is my bar

370
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:07,170
people with tremendous amounts of

371
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:09,910
antibiotics it's not even about bacteria

372
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:11,800
viruses don't get stopped from an

373
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:13,509
antibiotic antibiotics make viruses

374
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:15,610
worse that's why the Lyme community has

375
00:15:13,509 --> 00:15:17,500
suffered decade after decade have gotten

376
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:19,899
worse and worse and it was like no Liz

377
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:21,639
you know and at that point I didn't know

378
00:15:19,899 --> 00:15:23,529
you like you know like a best friend now

379
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:25,600
but at that point I was like Liz no you

380
00:15:23,529 --> 00:15:28,360
can't go through this I can't watch you

381
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:30,050
go through this but you were relieved to

382
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:33,380
know that it wasn't

383
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:35,840
there was I was relieved when I got the

384
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:37,850
Lyme diagnosis I was hugely relieved I

385
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:40,100
was like finally someone knows what's

386
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:41,870
going on with me but when Anthony told

387
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:43,880
me it wasn't Lyme there was no

388
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:46,250
resistance for some reason I wasn't in

389
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:49,130
there wasn't a need for me to hang on to

390
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:51,680
it because I really understood what he

391
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:54,470
was like everything he was saying made

392
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:57,200
sense in a way that I that I don't

393
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:59,720
doesn't make sense with other people

394
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:03,560
that I've seen it's completely his

395
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:05,470
knowledge is has research to back it up

396
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:08,330
and he's dedicates his life to

397
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:10,730
understanding underlying root causes of

398
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:13,160
issues of illness well the research

399
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:15,080
comes later what I when I when I told

400
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:17,900
the world Hashimoto's thyroiditis many

401
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:19,190
years ago and even published it and said

402
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:21,310
that the Hashimoto's thyroiditis is

403
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:22,850
caused by epstein-barr virus and

404
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:25,250
fibromyalgia is caused by epstein-barr

405
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:27,710
virus it came out later that they found

406
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:30,560
a link with epstein-barr so the research

407
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:32,390
comes later and that's what's always

408
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:34,040
happy to work sure the research shows up

409
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:35,450
and people say oh he must have got it

410
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:38,060
from the research know the research

411
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:39,740
guided for me that's the irony and it's

412
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:41,270
so crazy how that works and the same

413
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:42,950
thing with Lyme disease I've been saying

414
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:44,990
it's viral all these years now they took

415
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:46,370
it and put an autoimmune category now

416
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:49,550
they're trying to phase out the

417
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:51,290
bacterial energy about it all and

418
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,760
doctors are swimming like they're

419
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:54,230
swimming in a sea of confusion now

420
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,730
doctors are like wait a minute I thought

421
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:57,260
we were treating bacteria and then you

422
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:58,880
get the old dogs left that are still

423
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:00,110
treating bacteria but the new doctors

424
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,210
now that are getting all the medical

425
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:03,350
medium books all the new doctors that

426
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:04,910
have them in their offices and

427
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:07,400
everything they're treating it like

428
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:09,260
viral now they're starting to because

429
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:11,870
neurological Lyme is in the autoimmune

430
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:13,939
category so it's really it's really

431
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:15,620
amazing how millions of these medical

432
00:17:13,939 --> 00:17:18,410
medium books have been infiltrated

433
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:20,600
doctor's office offices have gone into

434
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:22,670
people's hands and it's changed what

435
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:25,310
happened them the big mistake the Lyme

436
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:27,199
mistake and I know a lot of the Lyme

437
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:28,910
groups online don't understand this yet

438
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:30,320
many of them do many of them I know that

439
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:32,120
Medical meaning books were a dirty

440
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,950
secret for a lot of people because they

441
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:36,680
would get they would get like you know

442
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:38,900
you know hassled if they got off the the

443
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:40,850
road of it being bacterial but this is

444
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:42,370
saving lives it's safe so many countless

445
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:44,169
lives that when you're a girl

446
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:46,330
you're 21 years old you're you know

447
00:17:44,169 --> 00:17:49,059
young woman you can't finish college or

448
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:50,770
you're trying to struggle to do college

449
00:17:49,059 --> 00:17:52,390
and you're visiting 23 I mean how many

450
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:55,120
doctors did you see like five doctors

451
00:17:52,390 --> 00:18:01,900
five doctors is a lot of doctors five

452
00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:04,059
doctors is a lot of doctors at least

453
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:08,520
over the course of six years probably

454
00:18:04,059 --> 00:18:11,289
around 25 at least that's incredible I

455
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:14,830
went I had I had no other option though

456
00:18:11,289 --> 00:18:21,460
because I was I was I was in unable to

457
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:22,539
function so if I didn't for myself there

458
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:24,880
would be no one because no one

459
00:18:22,539 --> 00:18:28,240
understood what was going on no one

460
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:30,340
around me social media social media

461
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,169
wasn't born you know what happens is

462
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:34,029
like a lot of you guys you guys tell

463
00:18:32,169 --> 00:18:36,100
your stories you show your stories you

464
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:37,659
show like your skin problems you show

465
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:40,000
you talk about your chronic illness your

466
00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:41,590
neurological problems now you know young

467
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,240
women are allowed to actually they're on

468
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:44,710
social media even though it's still

469
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:46,809
swept in the carpet even though it's

470
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:49,809
still not taken seriously out there but

471
00:18:46,809 --> 00:18:52,120
it's still a platform this is like two

472
00:18:49,809 --> 00:18:55,179
thousand eight nine ten this was a

473
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:57,130
really dark period for young women with

474
00:18:55,179 --> 00:18:59,230
with this kind of problem I mean it's

475
00:18:57,130 --> 00:19:00,909
you're you're a fighter that's how I see

476
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:04,059
it you know you're a fighter and you're

477
00:19:00,909 --> 00:19:06,820
like okay yet you you you saw 25 doctors

478
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:09,610
and you just I mean it's it's amazing

479
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:11,649
yeah I just think about the people out

480
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:13,779
there who don't you know are getting

481
00:19:11,649 --> 00:19:16,029
misdiagnosed I think that's the problem

482
00:19:13,779 --> 00:19:17,919
it's not just about Lyme it's kind of

483
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:19,360
like you're being you're being diagnosed

484
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:25,289
maybe it's the right diagnose but

485
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:27,100
there's no there's no long-term like

486
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:29,950
understanding of what's going on

487
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:32,799
underneath of just giving someone a pill

488
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:34,299
and Taotao and maybe the pill is a

489
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:35,799
little bit helpful and that's good maybe

490
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:37,510
you have to take the pill that's okay

491
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:39,970
that's no problem if you have to take

492
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:41,860
the pill but it's it's that there's no

493
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:43,510
regard for anything else because they

494
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:46,390
don't understand they don't they don't

495
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:49,450
know what is going on yeah no it I

496
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:53,230
totally I totally get it but I didn't I

497
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:55,640
only lived it on on by seeing you know

498
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:57,350
like your your struggle okay

499
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:59,480
I lived it that way seeing others

500
00:19:57,350 --> 00:20:01,490
struggle over the years but I'm a I

501
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:04,340
haven't lived it physically you know I

502
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:06,530
haven't lived it on that level so I

503
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:08,840
can't put myself in your shoes because I

504
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:10,760
haven't lived that I haven't had you

505
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:12,650
know where I was struggling like that

506
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:14,630
you know physically with a lime

507
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:17,810
diagnosis or anything else but I can't

508
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:20,120
imagine what that's like when you're

509
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:22,910
young when you're older it's hard oh my

510
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:24,560
god women and 30s women are the forties

511
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:27,440
women and the fifties it's it's it's

512
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:30,320
hard but I can't imagine though I mean

513
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:32,330
your life should not be disturbed

514
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:35,660
it should not be kind of like

515
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:37,640
roadblocked because you know you've got

516
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:39,500
this diagnosis that the science of

517
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:41,900
research has nothing no knows nothing

518
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:44,510
about and that's the hard part for me

519
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:45,920
it's like when you're healthy and you

520
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:47,570
feel undestructible and nothing seems

521
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:50,420
wrong science research seems to have all

522
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:52,550
the answers but it kills me when I know

523
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:55,310
that they don't have the answers but

524
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:56,960
we're pretending they do and then your

525
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:58,250
life stops because of it but what about

526
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,260
all the other young women out there

527
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:01,970
their lives stopped because of it

528
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:04,490
because science research doesn't have

529
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:07,670
that answer and so you know visiting

530
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:09,290
doctors and and I mean you find out who

531
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:11,120
your friends are and if you realize you

532
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:13,430
can't keep up with what you you know and

533
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:15,440
all of it it just it becomes difficult

534
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:17,420
and yeah that's why I say you're a

535
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:20,090
survivor of this and you're a survivor

536
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:22,730
of it but you're still really young of

537
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:25,310
course but you're a survivor of during

538
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:28,850
that that dark period that was coming

539
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:31,640
out of 2008 2009 2010 no social media

540
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:33,530
kind of platform the lime groups weren't

541
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,610
there for support there wasn't you know

542
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:36,380
he whether they have the right

543
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:39,200
information or not there wasn't any of

544
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:41,690
that and you know you were in it alone

545
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,750
is what I'm saying and yeah you found me

546
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:47,360
but you were in it alone

547
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:49,280
there's millions millions of other

548
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:52,280
people out there going through this who

549
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:56,120
are suffering and and there has to be

550
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:58,910
more than just a surface topical

551
00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:01,160
solution to what's going on I feel that

552
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:03,890
people need to realize if you're young

553
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:05,390
out there and you're going through

554
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:07,460
something and you don't know what it is

555
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:08,930
and you you know the people around you

556
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,590
are looking at you like what's wrong

557
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:12,169
with her

558
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:16,159
she's maybe she just doesn't want to do

559
00:22:12,169 --> 00:22:18,799
this maybe she's lazy you know just know

560
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:21,860
that they're you there's nothing wrong

561
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:25,039
with you and you just have a physical

562
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:27,110
problem and it's not your your fault

563
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:29,600
yeah and and it's not your body

564
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:30,620
attacking itself because that's what the

565
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,210
industry that's what science and

566
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:33,590
research wants she didn't know they want

567
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:34,880
you to know that your body is attacking

568
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:36,350
itself that's what they really want you

569
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,330
to they want you to believe I'm sorry

570
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:39,500
that your body's destroying itself your

571
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:42,980
immune system is destroying itself

572
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:46,039
that's why they moved lime into

573
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:47,240
autoimmune to is because not only was it

574
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:51,080
a complete mystery and it's not

575
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:53,240
bacterial but it's there because it

576
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:55,130
falls into the category now of because

577
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:56,720
Lyme people they have the Hashimoto's

578
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:58,130
and they have the thyroid problems and

579
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,299
they have skin problems they have all

580
00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:01,010
these other problems in the they're

581
00:22:59,299 --> 00:23:03,440
realizing they never even knew it Lyme

582
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:04,730
was to begin with so they so they just

583
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,010
now they're lumping it in to the

584
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:09,799
autoimmune category they want women they

585
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:13,880
want young women to know that their body

586
00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:16,820
is faulty and just and and it's

587
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:18,799
destroying them and our genes are faulty

588
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:20,690
their body's attacking itself they want

589
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:22,730
them to know that now why do they want

590
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:24,529
them to know that I don't have any idea

591
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:26,240
the only thing I can come up with is

592
00:23:24,529 --> 00:23:27,799
science researchers likes to protect

593
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,029
itself when it doesn't have the answer

594
00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:32,080
so if it doesn't have the answers it's

595
00:23:29,029 --> 00:23:35,570
going to protect itself over people but

596
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:37,549
but the bottom line is it's like so

597
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:39,110
you're in this position in your life

598
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:41,179
you're a young woman you're going

599
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:43,340
through this there's there's really

600
00:23:41,179 --> 00:23:46,549
you're in it alone that's how I see it

601
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:49,070
because you're walking out of doctors

602
00:23:46,549 --> 00:23:51,649
offices you don't have an answer you're

603
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:54,710
really sick I mean when I met you you

604
00:23:51,649 --> 00:23:57,830
were like you were you told me when I

605
00:23:54,710 --> 00:24:00,409
talked with you that you can't even get

606
00:23:57,830 --> 00:24:02,270
out of the house there was there was

607
00:24:00,409 --> 00:24:03,529
there was no exercising you weren't

608
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:04,700
gonna be able to exercise you weren't

609
00:24:03,529 --> 00:24:06,080
gonna be able to hop on a treadmill you

610
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:07,700
weren't gonna be able to do you know

611
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,990
that you weren't allowed you weren't

612
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:10,549
gonna be able to do Pilates or weren't

613
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:14,750
gonna be able to do things yoga things

614
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:17,390
that young women I was I was a high I

615
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:20,809
ran track in high school and I couldn't

616
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:22,590
God I didn't even know that but I I was

617
00:24:20,809 --> 00:24:24,779
a sprinter in high school but I could

618
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:27,690
even get to the gym like I couldn't get

619
00:24:24,779 --> 00:24:30,690
out of the house and it wasn't you know

620
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:32,789
I mean so it doesn't matter if you you

621
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:34,980
know whatever it's well when when you're

622
00:24:32,789 --> 00:24:36,809
young woman your your running track in

623
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:39,179
high school you know that exercise

624
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:41,340
because exercise is also a release

625
00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:42,960
it's like release it's a great release

626
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:44,760
it can it can you know when you're

627
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,770
stressed out that's how you can battle

628
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:48,570
stress as a young person you're actually

629
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:50,820
even an older person whatever you can

630
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:52,860
you can you know you use exercise as a

631
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:54,929
tool how they tool and stuff so here you

632
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:57,390
can't exercise you have a history of

633
00:24:54,929 --> 00:25:00,120
running track that's that's a big deal

634
00:24:57,390 --> 00:25:01,470
and so and when I met you it's like I

635
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:03,899
remember you on a you know you're on the

636
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:07,049
phone and you were like Anthony I can't

637
00:25:03,899 --> 00:25:10,140
even I mean I can't even I can't the

638
00:25:07,049 --> 00:25:12,419
brain Fox so bad the fatigue is so bad I

639
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:15,809
remember you telling me your weight was

640
00:25:12,419 --> 00:25:18,090
really really low like really low you

641
00:25:15,809 --> 00:25:20,940
could barely eat because you mean

642
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:24,360
because you had no energy I mean it

643
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:26,100
takes energy to get food to make food to

644
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:31,049
eat food I mean all of it you were like

645
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:33,630
you were like and and you know you you

646
00:25:31,049 --> 00:25:35,159
bore it really well I gotta say because

647
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:38,029
when I was on the phone you were like

648
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:40,350
you were just like what do I need to do

649
00:25:38,029 --> 00:25:43,110
that's it you're like what do I need to

650
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:44,669
do and I get I get choked up about this

651
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:45,450
because it broke my heart to see you in

652
00:25:44,669 --> 00:25:48,750
this condition

653
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:52,380
and because I know I know who you really

654
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:54,750
worry the one thing about how it works

655
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:56,190
with my source and how I hear the voice

656
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:58,799
I hear and the gift I have and

657
00:25:56,190 --> 00:26:02,789
everything is I know who you are as a

658
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:04,409
person and and to know that you were

659
00:26:02,789 --> 00:26:06,480
suffering and struggling like this it

660
00:26:04,409 --> 00:26:08,190
just I broke my heart and I was like

661
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:11,399
look you know we're gonna get you better

662
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:13,440
and I mean and we were you were talking

663
00:26:11,399 --> 00:26:15,179
a lot we were you know connecting a lot

664
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:18,270
to make sure you you were you at least

665
00:26:15,179 --> 00:26:20,130
knew your body wasn't your body you that

666
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:23,039
you did have something going on it

667
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:25,470
wasn't Lyme and we had to now go we had

668
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:31,679
to go after the true problem and I

669
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:34,559
remember then the spirulina came I think

670
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:36,820
I consumed so much spirulina in that

671
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:39,200
amount of time

672
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:41,660
remember I have some right in here my

673
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:43,730
heavy-metal detox movie but I remember

674
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:46,850
coming home one day and there was

675
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:50,900
spirulina all over my kitchen my cat had

676
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:53,000
knocked down a glass bottle maybe the

677
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:57,110
whole thing had exploded everywhere and

678
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,940
I took me like weeks to clean it up I

679
00:26:57,110 --> 00:27:01,790
just had so much spirulina during that

680
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:04,520
time and I was you know in cilantro

681
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:05,900
I remembered juice I was juicing I was

682
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:08,750
juicing all the time

683
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:11,240
and it was so helpful for the brain fog

684
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:14,360
especially huh oh my god the juicing

685
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:15,710
yeah because you know what Happel I had

686
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:17,390
somebody recently tell me like oh you

687
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:19,190
just started this the other day your

688
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:22,070
heavy metal detox movie are you kidding

689
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:23,300
this is going all the way back 2010-2011

690
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:23,930
and you're doing the spirulina and

691
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:26,540
cilantro

692
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:28,250
yeah because spirit always had this

693
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:30,410
information going all the way back and

694
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:32,570
that's a thing because it's that it's

695
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:35,540
that I watched it help so much so the

696
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:39,380
cilantro the spirulina those two alone

697
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:41,030
were helping you and and I think I try

698
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:44,270
to get you on the wild blueberries I

699
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:47,000
think that was happening I think a lot

700
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:51,020
of fruits because it was anti fruit then

701
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:55,700
to fruit every few every hour I had to

702
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:56,960
have a piece of fruit yeah and yeah but

703
00:27:55,700 --> 00:28:00,440
you were you were like you were like

704
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:02,360
what do I need to do and I was like you

705
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:05,480
got to do fruit because fruit kills

706
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:07,430
pathogens and that information still

707
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:09,260
isn't out there you can even surf surf

708
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:11,480
around you YouTube and find all these

709
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:13,070
professionals that are on there talking

710
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:14,540
they're not they're not Pro fruit they

711
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:16,940
don't think fruit does anything and it

712
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:19,100
literally saves lives and that's the sad

713
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:21,110
part about you know if your first time

714
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:23,510
watching this learn this now and put

715
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:26,120
your belief system aside and and

716
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:27,530
actually learn but it's it's the fruit

717
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:29,300
and I remember telling you know you got

718
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:31,640
to do all this fruit and you were just

719
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:33,590
like you're like you're just tough

720
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,980
you're just like okay what do I got to

721
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:37,310
do

722
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:39,680
and you remember I remember and and it

723
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:41,300
wasn't and you weren't afraid and I have

724
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:45,260
to say that I understand when people are

725
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:47,030
afraid I I understand that but but and

726
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:48,510
and people are afraid when they're

727
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:52,270
trying something

728
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:54,669
isn't so popular like right now the

729
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:58,960
world hates fruit so much for no reason

730
00:28:54,669 --> 00:29:01,240
and back then 2010 they hated it but it

731
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:03,070
was a little easier to also do because

732
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:04,690
it was like it wasn't so bad with so

733
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:07,330
many professionals you know harping on

734
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:09,549
fruit like they do now but it's like but

735
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:11,380
you still did it and it was odd you were

736
00:29:09,549 --> 00:29:12,940
like you know meaning was odd that I

737
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:14,470
would recommend that kind of fruit nice

738
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:16,600
every hour you had to have it because

739
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:19,870
your nervous system and this is the

740
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:22,330
thing when you have a nervous system and

741
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:24,010
it's a viral load causing the problem so

742
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:25,779
with you was the up steam bar which

743
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:27,520
everybody has if you don't think you

744
00:29:25,779 --> 00:29:29,230
have Epstein bar you're wrong it sits

745
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:32,169
inside all of us and it'll waits for an

746
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:34,390
opportunity whatever that might be you

747
00:29:32,169 --> 00:29:36,820
may accidentally get more heavy metals

748
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:38,679
through some Avenue that that you know

749
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:40,870
we research and we know where mercury is

750
00:29:38,679 --> 00:29:45,250
or other metals and lumina manned copper

751
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:48,309
but we all have epstein-barr and young

752
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:50,200
or old we all have it and it awaits to

753
00:29:48,309 --> 00:29:52,990
want to come out one day and wreak a lot

754
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:56,140
of havoc and so you had the epstein-barr

755
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:57,580
you had the mercury and the aluminum the

756
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:59,440
epstein-barr feeds off the mercury in

757
00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:01,510
aluminum you get the brain fog you get

758
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:04,230
the brains the brain inflammation you

759
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:08,289
get the nerve inflammation and then

760
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:09,880
that's that's where you were and and the

761
00:30:08,289 --> 00:30:12,340
fruit was so important because you

762
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:13,990
needed you need a glucose for the nerves

763
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:16,210
and the nervous system the nervous

764
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:18,330
system runs on sugar

765
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:20,470
another great mistake now you guys is

766
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:22,450
everything's Kido Kido Kido I'm not

767
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:25,419
making fun and Kido Kido has it has a

768
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:26,740
some offers a lot of great stuff because

769
00:30:25,419 --> 00:30:28,630
it gets you off of processed foods and

770
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:30,070
all this other junk and garbage so it's

771
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:31,990
really good on that level but when

772
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:36,039
you're really sick and you got real

773
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:37,840
issues going on that's don't they they

774
00:30:36,039 --> 00:30:39,789
starve your nervous system they don't

775
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:41,409
feed it so if you're somebody if you're

776
00:30:39,789 --> 00:30:43,299
a young woman dealing with Lyme in your

777
00:30:41,409 --> 00:30:45,130
neurological Lyme and all of that the

778
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:46,960
last thing you want is to beat your fats

779
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:49,500
to be threw off the chart and the high

780
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:51,850
fat diet just because it's popular and

781
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:53,230
you don't want that you want to make

782
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:55,630
sure there's lots of sugar in your diet

783
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:58,990
healthy natural sugar like steamed

784
00:30:55,630 --> 00:31:00,700
potatoes and and and I think I had you

785
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:01,280
on steamed potato so I'm pretty sure at

786
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:03,380
one point

787
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:05,270
and fruits like the bananas and the

788
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:07,550
blueberries and all this because it's

789
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:09,950
sugars that revive and revitalize your

790
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:12,500
nervous system when you're going through

791
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:15,710
this inflammation in this neurological

792
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:18,050
Lyme and if your first time seeing this

793
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:21,470
just don't pooh-pooh it you take this

794
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:24,800
advice she did and I mean did it save

795
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:27,110
your life I mean so what I became just I

796
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:29,930

severe constipation and things going on

798
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:37,010
and the gut was the first thing to heal

799
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:40,220
my gut my gut was the first thing to

800
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:43,100
heal in a matter of weeks I was coming

801
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:44,510
back to normal like it was unbelievable

802
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:46,340
so you're on the phone with me and

803
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:49,460

was getting like I was feeling better

809
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:03,140
like you know with my stomach and then I

810
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:05,630
was slowly getting the you know anxiety

811
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:07,730

812
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:09,980

energy levels residual issues because I

815
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:22,190
I found Anthony later on unfortunately

816
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:24,410
though oh yes I'm you but it's very you

817
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:27,170
know it's very manageable like I'm hot

818
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:28,940
you know it's nothing you got your you

819
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:30,680
got global she has her global strays

820
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:31,730
foundation because I want you to get a

821
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:33,530
chance to talk about that for a minute

822
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:35,600
cuz that's important because this is

823
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:38,180
this is this is a big deal to me right

824
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:41,390
here is here you are you recovered from

825
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:44,990
something so that was so difficult and

826
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:46,790
and you were suffering and because of

827
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:47,690
recovering from that you're saving

828
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:50,660
animals

829
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:52,130
you're saving dogs which I have a love

830
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:53,660
for dogs that's why I talk about it in

831
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:56,480
the first book I have you know the

832
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:59,540
storage story with August and and

833
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:01,970
everything and and and dogs me in the

834
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:03,230
world to me and they just do animals

835
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:05,360
didn't mean the world to me - of course

836
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:09,020
and so what happened is you're you're

837
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:11,660
now doing this powerful work globally on

838
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:13,220
saving dogs and it's called global

839
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:14,690
strays and I want everybody to check

840
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:16,910
that out its global straight

841
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:18,980
and look into that if donate to it or

842
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:20,720
whatever I don't know how its set up but

843
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:22,430
you you know that's yeah you can make

844
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:24,770
donations and so forth she can help out

845
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:29,210
animals but she's she's running that

846
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:30,650
that's and and but yeah so also when I

847
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:32,000
got better I was able to go back to

848
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:34,450
school I always wanted to study

849
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:37,390
photography and I was able to become a

850
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:39,800
photojournalist for a few years and then

851
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:42,290
in New York City which I absolutely

852
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:45,170
loved I loved I loved photojournalism

853
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:48,770
and I still do love it and but I was

854
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:50,690
gravitated towards helping animals and

855
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:52,490
the people that were rescuing animals in

856
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:55,850
parts of the world were there is very

857
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:58,130
little help for animal welfare issues so

858
00:33:55,850 --> 00:34:00,170
I travel to parts of the world Central

859
00:33:58,130 --> 00:34:02,690
America and I saw there was an

860
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:05,960
overpopulation crisis of animals

861
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:09,500
everywhere horses dogs cats everywhere

862
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:11,960
and it was astounding to me that nothing

863
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:13,940
was being done to control the population

864
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:16,580
to help these animals and I started

865
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:18,410
meeting with animal rescuers who were

866
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:18,830
doing incredible work but they had no

867
00:34:18,410 --> 00:34:21,500
help

868
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:24,860
they had no outside donations so that's

869
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:28,100
how I began global streams began to

870
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:30,980
develop it was the need to help people

871
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:33,800
who had no help and they wanted to help

872
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:36,500
animals and we're helping horses we're

873
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:39,350
helping dogs were helping cats in a

874
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:41,930
different and not just in in rescuing

875
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:44,660
one one animal at a time we help

876
00:34:41,930 --> 00:34:46,790
families with veterinary care who cannot

877
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:49,550
afford veterinarian care for their pets

878
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:52,190
incredible so when we do say neutering

879
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:54,650
and educational program so people can

880
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:57,050
understand more about the love of the

881
00:34:54,650 --> 00:35:00,380
love for animals and why animals are

882
00:34:57,050 --> 00:35:02,210
important animals have also changed they

883
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:05,450
have the animals help me they support me

884
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:08,030
emotionally I mean my dogs are there my

885
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:10,670
therapy now my therapy with everything

886
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:13,070
going on and you know it's it's such a

887
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:14,780
critical part of my life so I know it's

888
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:16,430
part of you know cats and dogs and

889
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:18,830
horses and they're a part of everybody's

890
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:22,100
life so many people out there so while

891
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:24,380
she's doing incredible work me and and

892
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:26,210
she she healed to do that so you feel

893
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:27,830
like you feel like you know you're it's

894
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:30,020
manageable now like

895
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:32,510
you can you can work you even went back

896
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:35,750
to school and it's manageable completely

897
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:38,210
manageable I'm living wonderful life and

898
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:39,830
I mean there's no obviously there's days

899
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:41,420
that sometimes it comes a little bit of

900
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:43,490
it comes back and I have to take more

901
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:46,790
supplements and I have to you know and

902
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:50,180
you can't you know but I'm unable to do

903
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:52,520
what I what I couldn't do without that's

904
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:54,080
incredible that's incredible what were

905
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:57,590
some of the other supplements that I had

906
00:35:54,080 --> 00:36:00,080
you on the zinc e 12 b12 because the b12

907
00:35:57,590 --> 00:36:02,720
is critical and if you don't just get

908
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:06,260
any b12 the best b12 is the benarjee

909
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:07,610
calm I gave some way in a giveaway I

910
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:09,590
purchased some and gave someone a

911
00:36:07,610 --> 00:36:12,410
giveaway recently so it's of energy v as

912
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:15,050
in Victor I am ERG why energy outcomes

913
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:16,940
so they're b12 is key and because it's a

914
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:19,040
special blend it's a quality and

915
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:21,470
everything but b12 is imperative for

916
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:23,510
your nervous system and what happens is

917
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:25,310
with people when they have neurological

918
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:26,870
Lyme or any kind of nervous system

919
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:28,430
diagnosis whether it's fibromyalgia

920
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:31,430
whether it's any anything

921
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:32,870
and whether it's CFS you know mecfs

922
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:35,660
whatever it might be that you got a

923
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:37,760
diagnosis of what happens is that your

924
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:39,590
b12 might be high at the doctor's office

925
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,930
and they don't know you still need it

926
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:43,910
that you can't go by that reading on

927
00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:45,440
your bloodwork that your b12 is high and

928
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:47,510
you don't need any b12 it's a great

929
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:49,010
mistake great mistake at the doctor's

930
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:50,210
office it's not the doctors fault for

931
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:52,010
not knowing these things they're not

932
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:53,360
gonna have a source of then they're not

933
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:55,130
gonna have a source that can provide

934
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:57,530
them the information like I do they're

935
00:36:55,130 --> 00:37:00,620
just not so what happens is the b12

936
00:36:57,530 --> 00:37:03,350
critical for your recovery and you know

937
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:06,500
and and and zinc's another one to zinc

938
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:07,880
is critical for recovery because of the

939
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:09,560
viral issue so when you have

940
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:11,930
neurological Lyme or any kind of Lyme

941
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:14,240
disease diagnosis whatever it is you

942
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:16,820
need zinc because it's your defense

943
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:20,000
that's your defense against the viral

944
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:21,560
issues that created and and the people

945
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,090
with with Lyme disease they'll have the

946
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:25,370
heavy metals too toxic heavy metals

947
00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:27,550
whether they know it or not and they'll

948
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:29,600
have the pathogen the epstein-barr

949
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:30,890
epstein-barr and shingles they'll have

950
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:34,310
either both of those yours was

951
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:36,410
epstein-barr and and so it's important

952
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:37,580
to know that but you you say you still

953
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:39,410
it's good you still take your

954
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:40,210
supplements though it's still because

955
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:41,890
you have

956
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:46,809
- and you still eat pretty good right

957
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:49,240
yes definitely I when I eat gluten is if

958
00:37:46,809 --> 00:37:51,280
I ever return to gluten that's when I

959
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:54,700
noticed my symptoms start to come back

960
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:56,470
so I have to stay gluten free that's

961
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:58,599
been one of the most helpful things with

962
00:37:56,470 --> 00:38:00,160
the gut especially yeah I just felt

963
00:37:58,599 --> 00:38:01,569
right away better when I took you

964
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:04,030
personally when I took luta now

965
00:38:01,569 --> 00:38:05,440
everyone's different but that was you're

966
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:07,210
gonna be sensitive to the things that

967
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:09,339
were that we're causing trouble at the

968
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:12,010
beginning meaning like you had the viral

969
00:38:09,339 --> 00:38:14,829
issue you had the heavy metals and then

970
00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:16,960
anything that that like gluten and dairy

971
00:38:14,829 --> 00:38:20,200
products if you do too many of those you

972
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:22,510
can get sensitive again because because

973
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:24,250
they get in the way of the body's

974
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:25,930
healing mechanisms they get in the way

975
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:28,089
of the body healing and everything so

976
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:30,430
I'm really proud of you for for doing

977
00:38:28,089 --> 00:38:38,280
that and we got some celery juice in

978
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:38,280
front of us but hopefully doesn't spill

979
00:38:47,369 --> 00:38:52,839
it's a it's a gentle anti-inflammatory

980
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:54,790
it's really amazing it's antiviral it's

981
00:38:52,839 --> 00:38:57,549
it's so it's it's a great one I love

982
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:59,740
tumeric - I mean vitamin C when the

983
00:38:57,549 --> 00:39:01,180
vitamin C gotta have vitamin C if you're

984
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:05,319
dealing with Lyme disease vitamin C's

985
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:06,760
critical and you you want to be generous

986
00:39:05,319 --> 00:39:09,490
with your vitamin C you want to make

987
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:10,720
sure you're doing an ester see that's

988
00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:13,000
number one

989
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:15,069
the Vemma G ester C is the best the

990
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,790
medical medium vitamin C shock therapy

991
00:39:15,069 --> 00:39:20,260
is incredible for people dealing with

992
00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:22,359
Lyme disease dealing with any kind of

993
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:24,549
diagnosis that's confusing autoimmune

994
00:39:22,359 --> 00:39:26,829
diagnosis of any kind because autoimmune

995
00:39:24,549 --> 00:39:28,210
any autoimmune diagnosis is viral you

996
00:39:26,829 --> 00:39:30,670
just need to know that's the only way

997
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:32,170
you're gonna learn and if you've heard

998
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:34,000
that before out there it comes

999
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:35,950
originally from the medical medium

1000
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,500
information and books so just know where

1001
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:40,119
it originates from so doctor toll tells

1002
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:41,500
you it's viral that autoimmune that

1003
00:39:40,119 --> 00:39:43,359
originates from medical medium

1004
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:46,089
information know where the source comes

1005
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:48,270
from but but I'm just proud of you

1006
00:39:46,089 --> 00:39:50,890
because I'm honestly you've always

1007
00:39:48,270 --> 00:39:53,049
you've always taken care of yourself

1008
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:54,070
since then - you didn't just get better

1009
00:39:53,049 --> 00:39:55,630
and throw it

1010
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:57,610
you know you didn't get better and just

1011
00:39:55,630 --> 00:40:01,020
throw it all away I've gotten people a

1012
00:39:57,610 --> 00:40:04,660
lot of people have gotten better and

1013
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:07,420
pulled them out of a dark space and they

1014
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:09,670
just kind of they forget what got them

1015
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:11,020
there meaning like doing all the good

1016
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:12,490
things and stuff so you always have

1017
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:15,220
these tools here and you're always using

1018
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:16,990
them and know better and it's amazing

1019
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:18,670
you know and I'm really proud of you for

1020
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:23,860
that it's incredible

1021
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:26,170
so overall like she say you know you

1022
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:30,610
learned how to heal you learned what the

1023
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:32,830
answer was it was a great relief to know

1024
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:34,990
you you actually had something else that

1025
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:38,500
you can pinpoint that was wrong like a

1026
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:39,940
real the real cause do you think that's

1027
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:41,170
gonna help out a lot of other people out

1028
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:47,710
there when they know that there's these

1029
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:51,310
other real causes other other things

1030
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:53,710
that could be going on yeah yeah it's

1031
00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:56,350
important if you get if you got a lot if

1032
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:58,300
you get locked into a certain belief you

1033
00:40:56,350 --> 00:41:01,210
got to be careful like if you're being

1034
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:03,610
told one thing is the one thing I notice

1035
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:04,960
is is that with the medical medium

1036
00:41:03,610 --> 00:41:06,880
information is always controversial

1037
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:10,360
because it goes against all of the

1038
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:12,550
trendy money-making things like Lyme is

1039
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:14,560
a is a moneymaker it's stood out there

1040
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:16,300
so what it is if you go against what

1041
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:18,280
they're trying to do then you know you

1042
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:20,410
look like you don't have the answer but

1043
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:22,420
they all have the answer be cautious on

1044
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:25,090
all those very things because that's how

1045
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:28,570
it works we get sucked into these trendy

1046
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:31,000
trendy protocols diagnoses and all the

1047
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:33,460
stuff out there these trendy ways of

1048
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,900
that things are handled or created we

1049
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:37,660
got to look out for that stuff because

1050
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:39,430
it can block you what happens is you

1051
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:41,380
know you get diagnosed with Lyme disease

1052
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:44,290
you get told it's bacterial you get

1053
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:46,360
thrown on antibiotics and you just you

1054
00:41:44,290 --> 00:41:48,100
feel like that's just the way it's gotta

1055
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:49,600
be but it doesn't have to be that way

1056
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:52,390
there's answers what I mean is you have

1057
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:55,960
to be open you something inside of you

1058
00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:58,240
were like no this is I mean is that is

1059
00:41:55,960 --> 00:42:00,880
that angelic intervention I don't know

1060
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:03,280
you just knew and just knew at the time

1061
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:05,650
meaning like you know you were just like

1062
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:07,840
you just knew you had to call me because

1063
00:42:05,650 --> 00:42:09,250
that's funny because so

1064
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:11,530
people when they say that they'll be

1065
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:13,990
like I don't know how it happened but it

1066
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:15,790
just it just did and I'm just blown away

1067
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:17,920
that you know I'm just blown away become

1068
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:22,060
friends we've become close friends all

1069
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:24,910
these years and I didn't think I back

1070
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:26,490
when I met you in 2010 okay

1071
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:30,220
I didn't think we'd be sitting here

1072
00:42:26,490 --> 00:42:31,540
right here and doing this this is this

1073
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:34,990
just blows me away

1074
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:37,480
I never thought that ever like if you

1075
00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:39,040
told me that then what do you talk about

1076
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:42,540
we're gonna be sitting you know what I

1077
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:46,690
mean we you know but it's incredible um

1078
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:48,160
and so overall every day your energy

1079
00:42:46,690 --> 00:43:00,340

00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:48,730
wasn't sick like you in the sense with

1114
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:49,930
the neurological I'm I haven't suffered

1115

in that level

1116
00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:56,770
I suffer from from just the the the

1117
00:44:53,710 --> 00:44:58,780
hearing spirit that's not fun and not

1118
00:44:56,770 --> 00:45:00,070
being able to do live a normal life

1119
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:01,840
because of it you know throughout my

1120
00:45:00,070 --> 00:45:04,510
life but that's you know my story in

1121
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:07,090
here but the point is is that I haven't

1122
00:45:04,510 --> 00:45:10,960
been in that trench myself personally

1123
00:45:07,090 --> 00:45:13,270
and I just I all I know is I can't

1124
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:15,490
imagine what you went through and you

1125
00:45:13,270 --> 00:45:17,920
know I am NOT going to pretend I can

1126
00:45:15,490 --> 00:45:20,290
because I've never felt that kind of

1127
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:23,080
fatigue and that brain fog and I never

1128
00:45:20,290 --> 00:45:25,780
had to go to 50 doctors for some people

1129
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:27,910
and 25 doctors ten doctors five doctors

1130
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:29,470
is too much and I've never had to do

1131
00:45:27,910 --> 00:45:33,460
anything like that so I can't imagine

1132
00:45:29,470 --> 00:45:35,320
