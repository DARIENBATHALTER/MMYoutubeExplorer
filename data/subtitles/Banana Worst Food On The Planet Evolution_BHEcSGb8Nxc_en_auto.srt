right

111
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:59,040
know the harsh truths behind why science

112
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,480
and research chooses not to invest and

113
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,680
look into the medicinal healing

114
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,760
properties of some foods such as bananas

115
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,760
and of course celery juice

116
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,120

117
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,480

never mind bananas right

120
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:20,880

121
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,880

124
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,919

podcast the ending was very intriguing

273
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,959
i'm wondering if you are going to give

274
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,480
us some more insights into some of this

275
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:57,040
in your next podcast

276
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:59,760
after the hint you gave us about it in

277
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,120
the last week's ig live thank you spared

278
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,880
the most high

279
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:06,160
medical medium and the whole medical

280
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,839
medium team bless your heart

281
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,240
i'm working on

282
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:12,320
an alien podcast episode i'm just

283
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,399
letting you guys know okay

284
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,079
i don't know what's going to happen

285
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,440
when it's released

286
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:19,279
i think i'm going to lose a lot of

287
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,399
followers

288
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,920
probably

289
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,720
because

290
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,959
alien podcast that i'm going to put out

291
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,120
is not like the usual crap

292
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:31,839
not like usual stuff where government

293
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:34,640
bases are harboring aliens

294
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:36,000
area 51 it's not going to be that usual

295
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,120
crap right

296
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,560
so

297
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,920
i'm not saying that's true or false or

298
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,440
anything i'm not saying that i'm just

299
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,399
saying it's not going to be the usual

300
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,560
thing

301
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:46,160
so the alien podcast that i'm putting

302
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,760
out

303
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:51,200
it's going to have some shocking stuff

304
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:53,680
in there right but it it may shock

305
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,200
people a little too much and i'm not

306
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,959
sure which direction they're going to be

307
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,800
shocked

308
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:00,480
i mean you'll probably just

309
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,399
lose thousands of followers because of

310
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,240
it but you know what

311
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,360
i'm always at risk of that any time any

312
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,800
time i go against the apple cider

313
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,480
vinegar people every time i go against

314
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,160

chocolate people whatever i

00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,360

317
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,120
psilocybin people i just lose people

318
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,120
anyways nothing i can do

319
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,839
the glam rose says

320
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,959

321
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,680
children

322
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:25,600

328
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,160
podcast we just did and i have all my

329
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,680
teeth

330
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,760
and they're all great

331
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,320
and um and i'm gonna like i'm like

332
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:46,640
getting up there in my age

333
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:49,440
right internet says i'm like 26 or

334
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:52,320
something i'm not i can promise you this

335
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,720
amy says why do i have histamine

336
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,079
reactions to them to bananas

337
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,399
is it the only thing you have a

338
00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:00,399
histamine reaction to that's it like

339
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,399
there's an actual reaction right when

340
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:04,720
you have the banana so that's something

341
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,320
to consider too right or

342
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,079
just you're told you have histamine

343
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,279
elevations because of bananas and stuff

344
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:11,440
like that i know that alternative

345
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:13,760
medicine is teaching people to be afraid

346
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,920
of banana they'll tell you anything

347
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,279
about the banana right so i'm just

348
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,200
curious that's the only thing that

349
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,639
elevates your histamine on any level or

350
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,079
is it foods you had the night before

351
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,839
that are elevating the histamines and

352
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:26,079
the bananas or just going in there to

353
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:28,320
try to clean things up so there's a lot

354
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:30,320
of different ways of looking at it

355
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,399
people get really toxic and they start

356
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,880
reacting to everything i'm reacting to

357
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,800
bananas now now i'm reacting to apples

358
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:39,040
now i'm reacting to strawberries now i'm

359
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:41,040
reacting to grapes now i'm reacting to a

360
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,720
melon now i'm reacting to a papaya now

361
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,480
reacting to a mango i thought mango

362
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,399
would be okay now i'm reacting now i'm

363
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,320
reacting to some mel cilantro man i'm

364
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,000
reacting to cilantro and that's what i'm

365
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,000
reacting to it's what happens is when

366
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,399
you get really toxic you just start

367
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,760
reacting all kinds of stuff

368
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,440
so

369
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,680
yeah so why does everybody have to

370
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:02,240
defend the banana how bad does it get

371
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:04,240
because i told you in the podcast

372
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,399
there's some evil seeds planted

373
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,760
purposely into the alternative movements

374
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,920
of functional medicine doctors and

375
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:12,880
podcast doctors right

376
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,639
and all the doctors rip bananas down and

377
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,959
they rip them down and they rip them

378
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:19,120
down to the point where they just want

379
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:21,360
you to eat the green banana where it's

380
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,680
totally green a hundred percent that's

381
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,560
what they want they want it to be like

382
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:28,800
green and only green the sugars are not

383
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,760
good for you and they just want it green

384
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,320
right

385
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:35,360
i might have a doctor friend show up

386
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:37,519
so we'll see maybe in a little bit

387
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,720
all right

388
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,560
so

389
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,480
let's talk about

390
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,800
right here okay

391
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,480
breastfeeding if moms are trying to

392
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,120
develop enough milk

393
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:51,920
to breastfeed their babies bananas are a

394
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:55,120
big one right there and not just one not

395
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:57,920
just a half a banana but if a mom

396
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,519
is worried about breast milk and wants a

397
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,279
full tank

398
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:04,480
a breast milk

399
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:07,440
right to go the distance

400
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:09,839
then it's critical to be doing bananas

401
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,240
bananas are critical for that and not

402
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:14,639
just one banana once in a while not just

403
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,399
a banana every other day

404
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,639
talking about making sure you're doing

405
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,720
some bananas six seven bananas eight

406
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:22,639
bananas a day you want breast milk

407
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,199
because bananas really crank up the

408
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:27,040
breast milk is what they do they crank

409
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:29,839
the breast milk up so there's a full

410
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:32,079
tank for the baby critical to know right

411
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:32,880
there

412
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,040
see

413
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:37,519
jay from youtube says please let me know

414
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:40,480
what to do i get real tired after eating

415
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:42,560
bananas alone nothing else so what

416
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,839
happens is like this right

417
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,839
if you're really tired when you eat

418
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:48,079
banana first of all you'd never get

419
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:50,480
tired eating nothing else nothing else

420
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:53,760
makes you tired so that's important to

421
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:56,880
know right there so a mango

422
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:59,279
watermelon a chicken dinner

423
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:01,519
piece of cheese an egg nothing makes you

424
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:02,959
tired just a banana so that that's

425
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,079
important so i want you to be your own

426
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:05,839
detective

427
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:07,199
i want you to be your own

428
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,440
detective

429
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:11,760
it's critical you gotta ask yourself

430
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,079
what else is making me tired when i eat

431
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,680
nothing else makes me tired nothing

432
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:18,000
nothing at all

433
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,519
not that pasta meal that that won't make

434
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,800
me tired at all

435
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,880
not that

436
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,399
that cookie that will make me tired well

437
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,839
if the cookies you know jacket with

438
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,279
caffeine and chocolate chips it's

439
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:29,040
definitely gonna not make people tired

440
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:30,959
right but

441
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:33,759
it's important to know

442
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:35,279
like is it just the banana so you have

443
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:37,120
to be your own detective you have to

444
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:40,720
really look at that because it can trick

445
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:42,399
you out right there so okay so if

446
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,720
someone has

447
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:48,000
neurotransmitter problems

448
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,600
if they have neurological issues right

449
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,040
vagus nerve issues they don't know about

450
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,720
neurotransmitter problems they don't

451
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,399
know about lots of toxic heavy metals in

452
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:58,480
the brain they don't know about right

453
00:15:54,399 --> 00:16:00,560
and you eat a banana you do get relaxed

454
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:03,600
you can get relaxed so yeah it's

455
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,720
possible the banana is may calming your

456
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,240
nerves

457
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,480
if your nerves are sensitive and

458
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:12,000
problematic a banana can give you a

459
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:14,800
temporarily nerve calming effect

460
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,759
which is incredible really very healing

461
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:20,320
it could be that kind of tired

462
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:22,160
versus some other kind of tired right

463
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,600
but also look at all your other foods

464
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:26,000
and what you're doing does anything make

465
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:28,000
you tired at all but because if nothing

466
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
makes you tired and a banana makes you

467
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,680
tired then that's a healing

468
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,639
tryptophan healing effect

469
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:37,839
neurotransmitter glucose

470
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:39,920
neurotransmitter chemicals getting to

471
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:41,680
those neurotransmitter chemicals like

472
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,839
you know that's the whole point all of

473
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:46,240
it very healing electrical impulses

474
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:47,680
neurons getting boom

475
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,040
all that glucose

476
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,680
trace minerals and neurotransmitter

477
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:55,199
chemical compounds doctors say we should

478
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:57,360
eat high fat low sugar diets for pcos

479
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,800
doctors know everything about pcos

480
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,959
that's why they're stopping all that

481
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,560
pcos out there huh

482
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:04,559
that's why they're able to fix all that

483
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:07,120
pcos out there

484
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:09,679
they know so much about pcos out there

485
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:12,240
that's why nobody has pcos anymore you

486
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:14,400
didn't hear about that there's no pcos

487
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:17,520
anymore it doesn't exist anymore because

488
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:19,039
the world of doctors cured it so pcos

489
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,720
isn't even out there anymore because

490
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:22,880
doctors are so smart and science

491
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:26,160
researchers so smart that they actually

492
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,959
eradicated pcos from this planet

493
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,640
so

494
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,559
did you did you know that did you guys

495
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:33,280
know that pcos doesn't exist anymore

496
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:36,880
they actually found a magic pill

497
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:38,720
the doctors found a magic pill for pcos

498
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,160
and it eliminated it all across the

499
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,320
planet there's not one woman dealing

500
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,840
with pcos anymore they eradicated it

501
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,400
because research and science are so

502
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:48,160
smart yeah they know everything so you

503
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,080

highly sensitive and maybe it's not even

the pesticide but even something else

523
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:35,039

00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,919
chocolates high in fat keep on going say

553
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:39,039

554
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:41,919

right

559
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:53,600
makes it so anytime you put any kind of

healthy sugar in you or any kind of

561
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:59,440
sugar in you your insulin resistance

562
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:01,440
kicks in because you got so much fat

563
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:04,000
pumping through your bloodstream that

00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,679
right

754
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:47,279
they believe that we were like

755
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:48,799
in it you know we that we were a snail

756
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:50,880
and then

757
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:54,320
from from a snail we turned into some

758
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:55,440
kind of like other crustacean right

759
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,960
and then

760
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,840
we went from there and then we turned

761
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,679
into like a minnow

762
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,960
and then we turned into a squid and then

763
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:05,039
we turned into

764
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:07,440
a jellyfish and then we

765
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:08,240
somehow were able

766
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,480
to

767
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,440
start breathing in oxygen

768
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,440
right

769
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:16,559
and we somehow turned into another

770
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:18,880
creature inside the ocean right

771
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:21,600
and then when when then from there we

772
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,799
maybe we turned even into a mammal

773
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,159
in the ocean

774
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:26,480
i don't know

775
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:28,080
turned into a whale but somehow we ended

776
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,640
up because the evolution science of

777
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:33,200
research right science research

778
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,480
right they're so smart you know

779
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,240
you can't mess with science research

780
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:38,399
they know everything they know why

781
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,840
everybody's sick

782
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:40,960
that's why you know

783
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,559
everybody's

784
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,559
poaching medical medium information of

785
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:46,159
why everybody's sick right now they're

786
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:48,320
actually poaching it

787
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:49,840
anyway signs of research so science

788
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:52,000
research is so smart right next thing

789
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:54,960
you know we got on land right and we

790
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:57,039
started crawling on land right and our

791
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,960
gills opened up right

792
00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:00,480
so another whatever a thousand years and

793
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,720
we've been our gills started breathing

794
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,720
in and then we developed lungs

795
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:07,039
right

796
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:09,840
and then now we're on the we're we're

797
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:11,279
then we became something else on the

798
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,880
right

799
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:14,720
now we're like

800
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:16,640
i don't know not a squirrel whatever

801
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,240
like a hedgehog or something

802
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:21,039
and then we became a bear and then we

803
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:23,840
became a monkey somehow right

804
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:25,919
because you guys know evolution right

805
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,440
science research is so smart they teach

806
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:30,799
that in schools

807
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:33,440
right so now now we're a monkey

808
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:35,679
somehow and then as a monkey we somehow

809
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,480
became like a gorilla

810
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:39,440
right

811
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:42,880
and then when we became a gorilla

812
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:44,880
we somehow became a human

813
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,480
i don't know how

814
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,480
they don't know how with their theory of

815
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,679
evolution they teach it as if it's

816
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,960
factual

817
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:52,640
anyway

818
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,480
right we became

819
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:57,039
a gorilla right

820
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,880
and it's kind of funny

821
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:01,279
we became a monkey or a gorilla the

822
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:03,120
monkey never became a gorilla

823
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:05,200
so i'm kind of confused about that one

824
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,960
just get just a private talk between us

825
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,480
okay

826
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,919
right

827
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,960
i'll probably get canceled for talking

828
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:12,880
about this stuff really because you're

829
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:16,159
not supposed to even talk about like

830
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:18,159
evolution right anyway so so

831
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:20,559
okay did the monkey ever turn into a

832
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:22,240
gorilla no the monkey's like a dick

833
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:24,320
right different species or something

834
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:26,480
gorilla's different either way

835
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:28,080
we somehow came from that

836
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:30,320
okay

837
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:33,440
here's here's the craziest part why are

838
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:34,799
there all these monkeys left over

839
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,159
friend of mine was in costa rica and

840
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:37,840
there's a like bunch of monkeys down

841
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:40,399
there it's like

842
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:41,279
why are they still there

843
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:43,360
like

844
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:45,520
has science figured out like why they

845
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:47,840
just they just aren't developing they're

846
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:49,919
just not turning into humans eventually

847
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:51,679
over time like have the science figured

848
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:53,760
that out right no they haven't

849
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:56,799
so anyway let's just go into this anyway

850
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,799
monkeys eat bananas

851
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:02,320
monkeys eat bananas now we care about

852
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:04,559
primates right

853
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:06,320
i'm pretty sure the human race cares

854
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:08,880
about primates right gorillas eat

855
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:10,399
bananas too right so we're supposed to

856
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,240
care about

857
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:13,840
right nature

858
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,679
right i saw a commercial the other day

859
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,679
there was a guy like saw a commercial

860
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:19,520
there was a guy like in a car so i don't

861
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:21,440
know if it was a car commercial and he

862
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:23,600
had this like grater on the back like he

863
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,720
had a rake on the back of the car and it

864
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:27,120
was like this

865
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,960
this hippie dude guy right

866
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,799
which is cool he looked cool

867
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,799
so he was in this like

868
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:34,080
million dollar car

869
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:36,159
on the beach

870
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:38,720
guy had like some long hair or whatever

871
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:40,880
he was in this like car whatever

872
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,720
and he was cruising on the beach and he

873
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:45,840
had this rake stuck on the back of the

874
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:48,399
car and the rake was picking up like

875
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:49,760
like bottles and stuff he was driving

876
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:51,600
real fast

877
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:53,200
the guy was wearing designer clothes

878
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:55,440
right so you know they're one of those

879
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,360
guys they got a little longish hair

880
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:59,600
totally decked out with really expensive

881
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:01,039
shoes really expensive clothes to the

882
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,760
tilt you know one of those kinds of guys

883
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:03,279
right

884
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,799
i'm not judging them or anything i'm

885
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:06,320
just telling you i'm giving you the

886
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:09,679
description

887
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:11,440
so so he's obviously an educated guy

888
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:13,840
got lots of money came from money or

889
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:16,080
something and he's in his fancy car and

890
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:17,840
he's on the beach driving right and he's

891
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,600
raking up with the rake on the back of

892
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:22,080
the car you guys saw this and he's

893
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:24,159
raking up like bottles empty bottles

894
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:26,080
plastic bottles and he's raking them up

895
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:27,919
and he's dragging him along and then

896
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:31,600
after that they show him sitting there

897
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:34,080
like relaxing like yeah man

898
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:36,320
i'm like really really

899
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:37,360
i really hip on taking care of nature

900
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,120
and stuff

901
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,480
and then all these sea turtles were just

902
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,720
everywhere of course they did come you

903
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:44,159
know computer images of the sea turtles

904
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,000
coming up like there's thousands of sea

905
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:46,720
turtles coming up to lay their eggs

906
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,200
right

907
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:50,720
and this guy's like proud of himself and

908
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,200
i don't blame him because he got some

909
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,159
plastic bottles off the beach

910
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,960
right

911
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:59,360
which is so we're like all about caring

912
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:02,960
for nature caring about our world caring

913
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:04,720
about our oceans caring about like ray

914
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,559
reptiles

915
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:09,279
caring about everything right that's

916
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:12,960
what we're about we're all about that

917
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:14,480
right then why the hell

918
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:17,360
on earth

919
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:19,279
is all this now food science guys all

920
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:21,039
the doctors

921
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:23,519
all the podcast doctors all the

922
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:27,120
functional medicine doctors

923
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:29,279
all the food science people

924
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:31,600
basically telling us we're [ __ ] if we

925
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:33,120
eat bananas

926
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,960
when they're feeding the bananas to the

927
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,880
monkeys because it's their natural food

928
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,559
oh it's fine for the monkey i thought we

929
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,320
cared about the monkey but apparently we

930
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:41,679
don't give a [ __ ] about the monkeys and

931
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,200
we don't give a [ __ ] about the gorillas

932
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:44,880
and the chimps because they're eating

933
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,240
crappy bananas and they're just gonna

934
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,559
die and have liver disease for the

935
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:50,559
bananas we shouldn't stop or intervene

936
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:52,480
that on any level we should just let

937
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:54,559
those monkeys just eat as many bananas

938
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:56,159
as they want that [ __ ] crap food that no

939
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:58,399
one's supposed to eat because functional

940
00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:00,640
medicine doctors and podcast doctors and

941
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:02,000
all the scientists sure know better they

942
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,840
know we shouldn't be eating this because

943
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,279
this is going to kill us this is bad for

944
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:07,840
us right

945
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:09,679
this is terrible if we start eating this

946
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,440
but make sure the monkeys are eating it

947
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:14,240
though they can eat it the gorillas can

948
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:17,120
eat it and everything else and heck if

949
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,720
they if we are in this evolution stage

950
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:21,519
those monkeys and grills are eventually

951
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:23,519
going to turn to humans so why the hell

952
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:26,240
are we feeding these monkeys and

953
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:27,760
gorillas all the bananas

954
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,519
well we know they're going to turn into

955
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:31,600
humans eventually

956
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:34,000
and then we're just genetically screwing

957
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:36,000
them up

958
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,279
how's that how's that make any sense to

959
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,240
you guys

960
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:42,000
so we care about life here in planet

961
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:44,159
earth hell there's commercials of like a

962
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:47,039
rich hippie dude in a fancy car with

963
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:49,120
decked out designer hippie cool clothes

964
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:51,679
or whatever regular clothes or long hair

965
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:53,440
nothing wrong with that pull in a car

966
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:56,080
with this stuff raking up plastic

967
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:58,159
bottles like he's like totally on it

968
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:01,679
sitting down relaxing all cool ready to

969
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:01,679
crack open a corona light

970
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:07,600
and then you know and then you know

971
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:09,839
turtles are coming up if we care that

972
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:12,000
much like we're supposed to care then

973
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:12,800
why the hell are we leaving

974
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,720
like

975
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,079
the monkeys and the gorillas behind

976
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,599
because they're going to be human

977
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:19,040
someday because science research tells

978
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:21,599
us those monkeys and girls are going to

979
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:22,800
be humans there's no question about it

980
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:24,639
there's no doubt because science

981
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,480
research is always right

982
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:28,639
they're always right about everything so

983
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,240
we have to trust science and research

984
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:31,919
because those monkeys and chimps and

985
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:34,480
those and those gorillas they're going

986
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:36,639
to be 100 a human being they're still in

987
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:38,399
the evolution phase so why the hell are

988
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:39,760
we doing what science research and food

989
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:41,440
science and podcast doctors and

990
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:43,520
functional medicine doctors are telling

991
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:45,200
us not to do is we're letting all those

992
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:46,639
gorillas and monkeys eat all those

993
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:48,639
bananas

994
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:52,720
and we're supposed to avoid them because

995
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:52,720
it's so damn bad for us

996
00:34:54,159 --> 00:35:01,880
can you answer that for me

997
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:01,880
cause i'm scratching my head over here

998
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,720
anyway

999
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,839
you guys got to check out the podcast

1000
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,680
episode

1001
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:10,640
because it's cool

1002
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,480
you know

1003
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:15,359
it's a good one it's filled in for

1004
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:16,920
information it's packed bananas are good

1005
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:19,280
for the brain

1006
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:21,920
neurotransmitters they're good for your

1007
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,960
like your organs your hearts is critical

1008
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,480
okay

1009
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:27,119
and

1010
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,720
i'm not an evolution fan so i look you

1011
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:31,440
can believe in what you want to believe

1012
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:33,040
in i don't believe in evolution

1013
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,000
i'm just saying

1014
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:36,640
but

1015
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:39,680
if if you believe in evolution i support

1016
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:40,960
you 100 i don't judge i don't judge what

1017
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,320
you do

1018
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:45,760
okay

1019
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:48,079
right i'm just not a big evolution fan

1020
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:49,680
i think it was purposely kind of put out

1021
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:52,800
there to take people away from the

1022
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:54,880
spiritual aspect of life

1023
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:57,839
is what i believe it was i believe it

1024
00:35:54,880 --> 00:36:00,960
was designed to take you away from the

1025
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:03,119
thought that we are spiritual beings and

1026
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:05,680
that spiritual

1027
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:08,560
connection up above

1028
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:10,880
matters and is real and the light up

1029
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:14,640
above matters and is real and i believe

1030
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:15,760
evolution this is my opinion

1031
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:18,480
was set

1032
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:20,400
there in stone and taught in schools and

1033
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,079
everything else to take you away from

1034
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:24,240
god the creator the light whatever you

1035
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:27,040
believe in up there the universe take

1036
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:29,359
you away from that to make you think

1037
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:31,680
that you're not you have no connection

1038
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:33,839
up there whatsoever you're just

1039
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:36,079
you were a toad

1040
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:38,079
and you went from a toad to something

1041
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:39,839
else a snail or whatever you went from a

1042
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:41,440
snail to something else and then finally

1043
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:43,040
you became a monkey

1044
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:45,520
and yeah we just left all the other

1045
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:47,839
monkeys behind if that's the case don't

1046
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:50,000
feed them bananas anymore man because if

1047
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:51,839
it's killing us these bananas why are

1048
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,440
you giving it to them or letting them

1049
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:55,599
eat bananas out there they should chop

1050
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:58,320
down every banana tree in the

1051
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:59,920
in the amazon

1052
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:02,160
besides the reason you should chop every

1053
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,599
single banana tree down and not let

1054
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,680
those monkeys and grills ever get a

1055
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:09,240
banana ever since they're so darn bad

1056
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:09,240
for all of us

1057
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:14,400
anyway

1058
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:16,240
which i hope they don't do

1059
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:18,480
but yeah bananas are that good for us

1060
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:20,320
and good for monkeys and gorillas too

1061
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,760
they are indeed

1062
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,520
okay let's talk about ripeness for a

1063
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,800
little a couple of seconds two way i got

1064
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,560
you guys

1065
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:29,280
addie case's celery juice and banana

1066
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:33,520
cleanse has caused more bloating yet all

1067
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:36,480
of my ms symptoms have been healing

1068
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:38,720
is bloating a healing reaction so here

1069
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:42,160
let's go into this addy on youtube very

1070
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:45,440
good question and i want to be at

1071
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,440
service here okay

1072
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:49,680
here's how it goes okay

1073
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,520
right

1074
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:53,760
inside here

1075
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:55,440
is the food from the past

1076
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:58,240
it's the chocolate cake it's the donuts

1077
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:00,560
it's the cookies it's the additives it's

1078
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:03,599
all the rancid fats it's the the

1079
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:06,640
putrified proteins it's all of this junk

1080
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:09,280
in crud that lines the inside of your

1081
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:11,200
intestinal tract so addie this is

1082
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:13,040
important to know right

1083
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,880
okay

1084
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:16,560
all in here

1085
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,760
right when people have multiple

1086
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,200
sclerosis and i talked about this

1087
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,880
because i was the first to publish the

1088
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:23,119
cause of multiple sclerosis so it was

1089
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:24,800
the first to publish the true cause of

1090
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:27,040
multiple sclerosis and now harvard took

1091
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:29,280
my information

1092
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:32,240
didn't cite me and they took it seven

1093
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:33,440
years later illegally

1094
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:36,560
anyway

1095
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:38,960
so the whole point is right here okay

1096
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:41,119
that all this junk and garbage is

1097
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:43,280
sitting in here and sitting in here

1098
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:44,880
somebody who has multiple sclerosis is

1099
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:47,599
viral

1100
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:49,760
lots of metals lots of other toxins and

1101
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:52,000
poisons and a weakened digestive system

1102
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:54,320
with a lot of junk inside here i teach

1103
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,000
doctors this all the time

1104
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:58,160
when you're sending a banana down there

1105
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,839
the banana rolls

1106
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:01,440
i talk about this in the podcast if you

1107
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:04,160
guys haven't listened to the podcast

1108
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:08,160
please listen to it right

1109
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:09,760
so bananas roll and they roll through

1110
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:12,839
your gut

1111
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:17,839
and they're collecting all that crap

1112
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:19,520
toxins poisons petrified proteins gases

1113
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:20,880
and when you have too much of all that

1114
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:23,040
in there you're gonna bloat for a little

1115
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:25,599
bit because it's getting released but

1116
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:26,960
yet you're healing and that's one of the

1117
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:29,040
reasons why

1118
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:31,520
multiple sclerosis symptoms are getting

1119
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:33,599
at bay and minimizing something very

1120
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:35,760
important to know right

1121
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:36,720
elizabeth healthy liz says walk on water

1122
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:39,760
effect

1123
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:41,520
exactly the walk-on water effect dear

1124
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:43,440

1147
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:29,359

1150
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:35,119

1152
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:37,920
the heel

1153
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:39,839
because

1154
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:42,319
there's so much information that went in

1155
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:43,599
here and it was so hard to put to put

1156
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:44,640
these together

1157
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:46,640
that like

1158
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:48,400
it's i forget some of the other things

1159
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,920
so thank you for reminding me you will

1160
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,800
be blown away you guys when you see

1161
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,560
these

1162
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:54,319
when you have these in your hands i mean

1163
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:56,079
seriously

1164
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:58,720
like

1165
00:40:56,079 --> 00:41:01,040
i'm afraid

1166
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:03,040
when those get out the industries are

1167
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:04,960
going to be so pissed at me

1168
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:06,720
because they're going to try to steal it

1169
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:09,119
like usually they always just steal the

1170
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:10,800
info from the medical medium books but

1171
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:12,000
when they see that when the industry

1172
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,200
looks at that

1173
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,040
because that's what they do they have a

1174
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:17,119
whole think tank they have a whole table

1175
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:18,880
of people around a board for them they

1176
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:22,079
they dissect medical medium stuff and

1177
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:24,319
information and then they thief it

1178
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:25,520
theft it away right that's what happened

1179
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:26,960
that's why

1180
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:28,480
all the different things over the years

1181
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:31,119
like the multiple sclerosis thing and so

1182
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:32,800

1183
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:35,119

1185
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:38,720
