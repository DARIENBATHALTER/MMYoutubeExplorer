1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,259
of course not

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:05,759
no just live our lives do our thing

3
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:09,420
whatever

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:11,099
no one gets radiation exposure and no no

5
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:14,280
no that's not true

6
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:17,400
radiation exposure is a big one

7
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,900
people are saturated with radiation

8
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:22,859
exposure

9
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:25,920
people are glowing with radiation that's

10
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:27,480
the reality that's the truth but we

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,279
don't want to believe that or even think

12
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,720
it's even possible we don't want to

13
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,600
think it's possible to have radiation

14
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,420
exposure how's it even possible

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,280
there's no way when you meet somebody do

16
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,120
you go hey how's your radiation exposure

17
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,460
today

18
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,460
No No One's Gonna Do That

19
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:48,420
but yet yeah there's radiation exposure

20
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:50,280
anyway what is this day 15

21
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,780
of the medical medium brain shot therapy

22
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,460
cleanse challenge we're doing radiation

23
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,980
exposure shot

24
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:58,500
right there this is an important one

25
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:02,340
because so many people

26
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:03,239
are exposed and nothing gets done about

27
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,519
it

28
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:09,180
nothing at all gets done about it ever

29
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,979
and the radiation accumulates do you

30
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:13,380
think the radiation exposure you get

31
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:16,020
just goes away

32
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:17,939
no it doesn't go away

33
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:22,439
it stays in US

34
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:24,420
it radiates out of us a lifetime we

35
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:26,340
collect radiation

36
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:28,920
why does it matter

37
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:32,820
because it affects our health it's part

38
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:34,680
of the death by a Thousand Cuts here on

39
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:38,520
planet Earth

40
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:40,380
it's one of the death by a Thousand Cuts

41
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,060
so I want to read a little bit about it

42
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:46,799
so let's get into it but first of all I

43
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:49,320
just want to say this is day 16.

44
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,119
of the medical mean brain shot therapy

45
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,640
cleanse challenge I don't know if you

46
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,500
caught me there I said 15 earlier day

47
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,020
16.

48
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,479
is the radiation exposure shot that we

49
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:02,880
have right here let's get into it and

50
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,280
let's talk about radiation if you guys

51
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,880
don't mind 237 do you have your brain

52
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,880
saver book

53
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,599
do you know what page we're on

54
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:14,520
if you don't have the book still hang

55
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:16,260
out let's do it let's talk about

56
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:19,379
radiation

57
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:22,260
if you do have the book Incredible

58
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:25,440
amazing

59
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:28,080
radiation and EMF section but I'm just

60
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,780
going to talk about radiation today page

61
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,180
237 if you're worried about EMF

62
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:35,160
Incredible Book to get information about

63
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:40,319
EMF exposure

64
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:43,379
so right there it is friend saver

65
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:46,280
common medical and transportation

66
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:46,280
technology

67
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,459
airplane travel

68
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:54,120
people get radiation from airplane

69
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:55,319
travel right but not just airplane

70
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:59,040
travel

71
00:02:55,319 --> 00:03:01,200
because they're in an airplane

72
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:04,459
that's one way

73
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:07,739
people get radiation exposure because

74
00:03:04,459 --> 00:03:11,580
radiation is in the atmosphere

75
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:15,120
from World War II

76
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:18,360
from when the bomb was dropped

77
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,400
froshima Hiroshima the bomb

78
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,800
that propelled

79
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,800
a massive amount

80
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:28,440
of radiation into our atmosphere it's

81
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:30,659
still there it's still floating around

82
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:33,840
when you fly in a plane

83
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:36,780
and the plane goes up

84
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,599
and it's in it's at that altitude

85
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:42,480
it is flying through the radiation

86
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:44,580
and yes we get exposure just from that

87
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,620
alone

88
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:48,060
another form of airplane travel we're

89
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,379
going to talk about and another form

90
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,819
we're going to talk about too but just

91
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:53,400
go through the basics airplane travel

92
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:55,560
x-rays

93
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,780
have you had an x-ray in your life when

94
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:00,120
was it you broke your ankle when you

95
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:03,739
were 13 years old

96
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,739
that radiation never went away

97
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:10,920
CT computerized tomography scans

98
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:15,320
p-e-t

99
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:17,699
position emission tomography scans

100
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:19,919
fluoroscopy so many people are still

101
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:21,239
getting fluoroscopy

102
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:24,360
MRI

103
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:26,580
magnetic resonance imaging

104
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:29,100
did I just say something stupid

105
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:31,800
I said something really stupid right

106
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:33,419
I must be a total dumbass

107
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:37,380
big time

108
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:39,240
did I just say MRI and radiation I must

109
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:40,680
not know what I'm talking about

110
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,060
I'm probably just one of those stupid

111
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,460
people in alternative medicine that

112
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:47,280
don't know anything I guess

113
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:49,919
up just screwed up bad

114
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:54,120
I put in the book here

115
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:57,419
MRI magnetic resonance imaging

116
00:04:54,120 --> 00:05:00,720
guess I'm that dumb why would I put that

117
00:04:57,419 --> 00:05:02,699
in there when that's not radiation what

118
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,820
was I thinking

119
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:07,560
a total dumbass

120
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:10,139
but guess what

121
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,400
it is radiation there is radiation

122
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:15,840
exposure

123
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:18,960
MRIs you get radiation exposure

124
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:21,419
fact you get radiation exposure

125
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:24,720
with MRIS

126
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:27,840
incredible right yeah

127
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,979
brain Savers info is amazing

128
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,020
all right

129
00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:34,220
food and water supply we get radiation

130
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:34,220
from food and water supply

131
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:41,280
common nuclear exposure current nuclear

132
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,460
weapons exposure and current nuclear

133
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:48,060
plant exposure need I say this but

134
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:50,160
nuclear testing is still happening

135
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:54,120
they still

136
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:59,280
test nuclear weapons

137
00:05:54,120 --> 00:06:01,440
they still create nuclear weapons

138
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,800
the amount of exposure going into the

139
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,360
atmosphere and into the

140
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:08,580
environment alone

141
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:11,220
from where they're building nukes is

142
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:13,759
unbelievable Untold as far as how much

143
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,759
exposure

144
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,580
I'd hate to be one of those guys right

145
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:20,340
that's

146
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:22,740
helping to build one of those bombs and

147
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:25,680
I'm wearing a hazmat suit and I'm

148
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:27,479
walking around with nuclear rods

149
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,580
it's like no don't worry don't worry you

150
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:31,979
got your suit on you're safe those guys

151
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:35,539
live about five years and then they just

152
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:35,539
exchange them and put new guys in

153
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:43,580
continual atmospheric Fallout from past

154
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:43,580
nuclear disasters Chernobyl anybody

155
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:51,120
it's still admitting

156
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:54,120
radiation everywhere right

157
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:56,880
Fukushima still emitting radiation every

158
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:58,740
day everywhere

159
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,900
every day it's just going into our

160
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:04,460
atmosphere every day but we don't have

161
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:04,460
radiation exposure on any level

162
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:10,860
nuclear test sites

163
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:12,060
all right are we having fun yet I might

164
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:16,199
have to have

165
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:18,240
a little sip here of lemon balm tea

166
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:20,099
but here's the way I do my lemon balm

167
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,419
tea now I want to pop a little bit more

168
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:23,759
in here because I kind of need this

169
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:26,160
right now I need a commentative

170
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,479
I actually need a cognitive when I'm

171
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,180
reading about this and talking about

172
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:32,580
this because there's a part of you that

173
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:35,400
gets so pissed off

174
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:38,220
that this stuff happens in the world

175
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:40,139
and no one has control over it nobody

176
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:42,539
has control over this crap

177
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:43,979
it's actually demented right isn't why

178
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:46,319
would we do this

179
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:47,460
anyway I'm putting some lemon balm

180
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:50,819
that's the

181
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:53,160
imagery lemon balm incredible stuff

182
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:55,380
so if you guys don't mind I'm popping it

183
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:59,160
in there that's my lemon balm tea it's

184
00:07:55,380 --> 00:08:01,740
way way more potent this way by far

185
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:04,860
hands down is using the lemon balm

186
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:06,900
instead of using like tea or whatever

187
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:09,660
oh

188
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:10,620
um I just need a commentive for my

189
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:13,680
nerves

190
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:14,759
and you guys know I endorse them Reggie

191
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,979
because it's the greatest stuff out

192
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:18,240
there

193
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:19,860
um

194
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,400
I just got to get a little in me I'm

195
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,400
sorry about that

196
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:27,900
this this actually topic always bothers

197
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:29,280
me you know how there's certain topics

198
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:31,379
that bother people

199
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,659
radiation is one that actually bothers

200
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:35,700
me like it just bothers me personally

201
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:37,560
like I feel

202
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:39,240
I feel like

203
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:42,060
I guess you would say just frustrated

204
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:45,959
about it because we're talking about

205
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:48,180
like Untold damage on this planet that's

206
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:50,279
just happening every day and no one's

207
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:51,600
talking about it they talk about like

208
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:53,040
climate change and everything they don't

209
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,860
talk about this this should be talk

210
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:58,140
about every minute it's insane

211
00:08:55,860 --> 00:09:01,680
Smith and pepper says I made my grandma

212
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:04,560
the trauma shock and lost shot after my

213
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:06,899
grandpa passed away yesterday

214
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:09,839
I'm so sorry to hear that I didn't tell

215
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:13,440
her what it was for after she drank it

216
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:15,180
she took a big sigh and said that was

217
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,339
just what I needed

218
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:21,120
Smith and pepper thank you for letting

219
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:24,300
us all know uh truly truly heart pours

220
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:27,300
out to you and your family

221
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:29,480
I think when it comes down to the

222
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:32,640
radiation exposure it's one of the more

223
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:35,040
I don't know it affects me emotionally

224
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:37,019
because I know on a larger scale and

225
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,700
spirit of compassion knows on a larger

226
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:40,620
scale of the kind of damage that's

227
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:42,779
hidden away and tucked away

228
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:44,399
so we're brainwashed and conditioned on

229
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:47,580
this planet and we're brainwashed and

230
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:49,320
conditioned to not realize

231
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:50,760
that all the countries that are building

232
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,920
nukes

233
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:56,160
that all the plants that have like blown

234
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:58,380
up like Fukushima Chernobyl whatever

235
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,339
the bomb that was dropped Hiroshima

236
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:02,580
right

237
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:05,760
all of this is still spreading untold

238
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:07,620
amounts of radiation around the planet

239
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,080
and the atmosphere right

240
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:12,540
and then the nuclear testing untold

241
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:15,480
amounts and so

242
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:18,080
why do you think in the U.S alone nobody

243
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,080
owns the land

244
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:23,820
eighty percent of the entire United

245
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:27,120
States is off limits to even step on

246
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:29,940
what same thing around the world

247
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,260
80 of all the other countries land you

248
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:32,880
can't step on

249
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:34,860
it doesn't exist where it's not supposed

250
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,839
to exist why

251
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:39,060
interesting

252
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:41,459
all right so

253
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:43,800
Let's uh let's roll let's talk about

254
00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:45,540
this stuff a little bit examples of

255
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,560
radiation exposure so let's head into

256
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:49,560
this area

257
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:51,660
I need a little bit more lemon balm

258
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:53,519
there's some topics that just really get

259
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:55,320
me

260
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,800
that's one of them

261
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,800
anyway

262
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:01,440
it's the vemergy it's the best stuff out

263
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:03,540
there

264
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,060
all right so examples of radiation

265
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:07,980
exposure

266
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:12,380
the obvious sources of radiation

267
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:12,380
exposure are dental exams

268
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:19,019
Jovana Valencia

269
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:19,920
I passed I get passed off too is it

270
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:22,860
pissed off

271
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:25,740
you know what you um I get pissed off to

272
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:29,959
aw right there with you where's my lemon

273
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:29,959
balm tea and Bemidji lemon balm 2.

274
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:35,940
I have to get some in me

275
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:38,040
just Elaine good to see you love Emoji

276
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:41,339
there's a lot to love with with that

277
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:44,100
company it's just unbelievable what they

278
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:46,940
do no one can touch what they do it's

279
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,940
just incredible

280
00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:51,839
the obvious sources of radiation

281
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,399
exposure are dental exams we know that

282
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:57,600
right

283
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:58,980
even digital ones or the panorama you go

284
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,459
into the panorama

285
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:03,899
you go in there you bite onto this right

286
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:05,760
it's like they put a little plastic

287
00:12:03,899 --> 00:12:09,060
thing on there and you walk up to it

288
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,959
right okay I'm standing here oh all

289
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,820
right

290
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:14,090
all right all right all right we're

291
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:19,340
gonna clean it out

292
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:23,190
[Music]

293
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:23,190
[Applause]

294
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:31,079
all right put a new wrapper on for the

295
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,920
next person put a new plastic wrap on

296
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:33,920
there for the next person

297
00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:40,380
that tasted pretty good though

298
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:44,360
oh there's a celery stuff

299
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:44,360
can't turn down a celery stick piece

300
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:49,980
I need to trace mineral salts

301
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,540
intuitively

302
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:54,060
because I'm talking about radiation and

303
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:55,740
nuclear waste and all that I needed

304
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:57,300
some Trace mineral salts and I needed a

305
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:58,860
combative which is the Bemidji lemon

306
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:00,779
balm

307
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:02,639
musette says where can I get the Lemon

308
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:05,339
Ball

309
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:08,880
and I do that's the vimergy Lemon Ball

310
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:11,760
these in Victor I Amazon Mary e r g

311
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:13,860
y.com

312
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,420
check it out check out the company no

313
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:17,399
one touches their stuff it's not only

314
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:19,079
potent but it's clean but what I mean

315
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:21,420
clean I mean real real real real real

316
00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:22,980
pure like no other

317
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:24,480
there's a whole bunch of reasons why I

318
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:26,220
can't go into it right now because I

319
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,800
don't have the time I have to just focus

320
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:31,320
on what we're doing with radiation but

321
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:34,320
by far the reason why I support these

322
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:36,720
guys with every fiber in my being and

323
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:39,899
soul is because of what they do and what

324
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:42,779
they've done with their products

325
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:44,820
I mean if I told you like and you you

326
00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:47,660
learned about how and why you'd just be

327
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,660
like Blown Away

328
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:54,360
all right

329
00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:57,959
Trace mineral salts cluster sodium

330
00:13:54,360 --> 00:14:00,060
cluster salts for my brain accommodave

331
00:13:57,959 --> 00:14:02,660
for my brain and nervous system please

332
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:02,660
thank you

333
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:07,920
the obvious source of radiation exposure

334
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:09,260
from Dental exams I just gave you the

335
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,880
demonstration

336
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:14,160
x-rays that's another one too

337
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:17,339
get a chest x-ray yeah

338
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:20,579
of course in other Medical Imaging

339
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:23,060
such as CT scans and even to the lesser

340
00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:27,060
degree MRIs which still has radiation

341
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:28,740
I'm not a stupid ass after all it is a

342
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:30,360
radiation exposure I know people will

343
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:33,120
argue about magnetic resonance in

344
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:35,899
imaging uh I'm sorry you but it actually

345
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:38,639
admits radiation

346
00:14:35,899 --> 00:14:41,579
sorry to tell you I mean that's what I

347
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:46,199
mean people don't realize this right

348
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:47,940
now what's interesting too is x-rays

349
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:49,380
if you go and you get a chest x-ray

350
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:50,760
somebody stands there they're going to

351
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:54,360
get chest sex right right they put the

352
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:56,339
apron on the apron is not covering all

353
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:58,740
the rest of their body properly the

354
00:14:56,339 --> 00:15:01,740
apron is not covering everything the

355
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:04,560
chest x-ray is centered here right but

356
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:06,060
it still spreads out everywhere so it's

357
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:09,680
like when we get a chest x-ray we're

358
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:09,680
getting hit everywhere regardless

359
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:16,380
yeah

360
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:19,740
even CT scans

361
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:22,079
or frequent dental work that exposure

362
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:25,579
can build up and have a more extreme

363
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:25,579
effect over time in our life

364
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:31,139
our brains sustain a milder effect from

365
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:33,480
the everyday radiation we're exposed to

366
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:37,199
from plane flights

367
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:40,139
cell phones and other devices

368
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:42,839
contaminated food and water

369
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:44,940
being near someone who just got an x-ray

370
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:47,639
or other Medical Imaging tests and I

371
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:50,519
just want to go into that a little bit

372
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:53,339
if someone had an x-ray

373
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:55,920
and we're close to them if you go to the

374
00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:58,920
doctor's office

375
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:01,920
and three people in the waiting room had

376
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:03,899
recent CT scans and x-rays

377
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,540
and MRIS

378
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:08,699
they're radiating

379
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:10,560
so when you're in that room with them

380
00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:12,420
you're getting that radiation if you go

381
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:15,180
to the dental office and someone just

382
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:17,279
had the Panorama they just had all the

383
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:19,139
digital x-rays

384
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:21,660
and they're sitting next to you in the

385
00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:24,720
dental office and the seat next to you

386
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:28,519
you're actually getting their radiation

387
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,519
it's it's incredible how it works

388
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:33,019
I don't usually say that

389
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:39,180
let's hope that doesn't become a habit

390
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:41,639
I pick up and start doing habits like

391
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:43,259
that our brain sustain milder effects

392
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:46,079
from everyday radiation we're exposed to

393
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:48,000
from plane flights cell phones and other

394
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:50,399
devices contaminated food and water

395
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,519
being near someone who just got an x-ray

396
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:55,980
or other Medical Imaging tests in the

397
00:16:53,519 --> 00:17:00,540
continual atmospheric Fallout from past

398
00:16:55,980 --> 00:17:03,000
nuclear disasters such as Fukushima

399
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:05,040
there's also Fallout from current day

400
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:10,500
nuclear testing and nuclear weapons

401
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:13,339
developing of which were unaware of

402
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,339
climate climate

403
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:20,220
climate nuclear production

404
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:21,360
production in everywhere new clip in

405
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:23,220
every freaking country nuclear

406
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:25,439
production that's what they're doing how

407
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:29,900
about that and how much that's causing

408
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:29,900
but no people like climate climate

409
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:34,919
it's like nothing is what it seems in

410
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,720
this world

411
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:38,640
nothing

412
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,740
there's also Fallout from current day

413
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,000
nuclear testing like I said nuclear

414
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:45,059
weapons development of which we're

415
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,660
unaware plus nuclear plants leak in

416
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:50,820
acceptable amount of radiation nuclear

417
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:53,340
plants leak

418
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:56,039
they're allowed to leak

419
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:59,460
because they're not fixable

420
00:17:56,039 --> 00:18:02,100
nuclear plants aren't fixable

421
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:03,799
I can't fix them well we're gonna shut

422
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:06,840
down that plant and then we're gonna

423
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:09,299
re-modify it and redo

424
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:11,340
the lead lining that surrounds it we're

425
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:13,260
going to redo that plant and you can't

426
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:15,059
redo the plant

427
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:18,900
you can't

428
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:21,720
you can't take it apart and redo it

429
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:24,840
so they up the acceptable amount of

430
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:28,620
leakage every single decade the the

431
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:30,780
stats for acceptable leakage is upped

432
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:34,940
so they let more out because you can't

433
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:34,940
fix it you just can't go in and fix it

434
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:41,179
now you know why I need the membership

435
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:45,260
now you know why

436
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:51,059
here's the one topic today I needed to

437
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:54,240
come out this Lorraine uh coglinio says

438
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:56,480
vimergy was very generous and sent me a

439
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,440
free bottle of lemon balm with my order

440
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:01,020
they're very generous their customer

441
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:03,299
service is insane

442
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:04,919
and they're very generous it's a mom and

443
00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:06,960
pop that actually cares about the

444
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:09,600
chronically ill it's their mission

445
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,640
that's the difference too

446
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:15,059
supplement companies don't mean they

447
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:17,520
give a f about anybody

448
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:18,960
you guys some women companies don't mean

449
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,760
they care just because it's a natural

450
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,500
supplement company out there it doesn't

451
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:24,900
mean they care

452
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:26,820
Denver G is a mom and pop that actually

453
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:28,380
understands chronic illness and they

454
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:30,720
understand people's suffering that's

455
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:32,280
that's that that's a big thing right

456
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,400
there Karen Churchill says my favorite

457
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:38,000
supplements is vermergy Lemon Ball

458
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,000
thanks

459
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:41,059
laughs

460
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:46,020
so I talked about the Fallout the

461
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,220
acceptable ranges of nuclear waste

462
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:51,179
that's leaking out where do you think

463
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:52,980
the frog with four eyes comes from

464
00:19:51,179 --> 00:19:56,400
you don't think there's a frog with four

465
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:58,679
eyes out there they find a lot of frogs

466
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:01,740
with four eyes

467
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:04,620
that's not a joke it's real Jenny Jenn

468
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:06,480
says I got an x-ray of my ankle then I

469
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:08,820
had to remind them of the protective

470
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:11,360
apron they don't automatically cover you

471
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:11,360
with it anymore

472
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:18,299
Jenny Chen 100 correct

473
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:20,820
not only is your experience 100

474
00:20:18,299 --> 00:20:23,580
validated

475
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:26,940
and correct and accurate

476
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:30,059
but they don't they don't apron anybody

477
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:31,679
really much anymore you have to ask for

478
00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:35,220
it and even if you ask for it they don't

479
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:38,100
apron you enough though x-ray the crap

480
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:39,900
out of you and they want apron parts of

481
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:44,299
you that they should they should always

482
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:44,299
apron the person down but they don't

483
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:50,900
where do you think the frog with four

484
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,700
eyes comes from

485
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:57,559
waterways near these plants

486
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:57,559
that's definitely not acceptable

487
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:02,880
we also inherit radiation

488
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:05,039
so if anyone in your bloodline ever got

489
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:08,280
an x-ray or visited a sheet store in the

490
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:09,960
days when they imaged feet using a

491
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:12,299
fluoroscope

492
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:14,039
even though hundreds of thousands of

493
00:21:12,299 --> 00:21:16,500
women's legs were amputated because of

494
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:19,320
using that fluoroscope because women

495
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:21,120
went to shoe stores a lot more than men

496
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,440
back in the day women went to shoe

497
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,900
stores all the time it was actually

498
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:28,620
therapy

499
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:30,299
back in the 1930s 40s and 50s women went

500
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,740
to the shoe store some saying this over

501
00:21:30,299 --> 00:21:34,200
and over again because people don't they

502
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:35,700
don't believe this

503
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:38,400
but they did

504
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:41,220
that was a mat that was a major outing

505
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:44,039
women trying on shoes back in the day

506
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:45,780
who still was a very big part of the

507
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:47,580
world we lived in back then and we

508
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:49,140
weren't born but we lived maybe you were

509
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:51,120
you were born Right Said people out

510
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:54,000
there much older than me or whatever the

511
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:58,140
point is 1930s

512
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,880
and 40s and 50s it was an event that

513
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:01,799
occurred constantly you go to the shoe

514
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:03,240
store you try on shoes all the time and

515
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:05,580
then you might not even buy them and you

516
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:07,679
go and you leave but you put your legs

517
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:09,299
in the fluoroscope

518
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:11,039
I remember when I broke that information

519
00:22:09,299 --> 00:22:12,600
out quite a while because no one even

520
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:14,880
talked about it like it never existed

521
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:16,860
before and I released that info back

522
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,780
into the world about it there are

523
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:20,580
hundreds of thousands of women around

524
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:22,260
this country alone never mind on the

525
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:24,539
planet that had their feet and legs

526
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:26,820
amputated off

527
00:22:24,539 --> 00:22:31,460
in book one I talked about that in depth

528
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:31,460
and the revised expanded over here

529
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:37,320
we inherit radiation so if anyone in

530
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:39,840
your bloodline remember what I said

531
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:41,820
bloodline never got an x-ray or visited

532
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:43,980
shoe store in the days when the Imaging

533
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:46,020
was about Imaging your feet with the

534
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:48,960
fluoroscope some radiation likely ended

535
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:50,820
up in you radiation

536
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,860
gets passed on from generation to

537
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:54,659
generation just like toxic heavy metals

538
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:58,320
and Mercury

539
00:22:54,659 --> 00:23:00,780
that is MM info how incredible that

540
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:04,140
piece of knowledge is it gets passed on

541
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:08,039
down radiation

542
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:12,780
so what happens is that we're actually

543
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:16,280
being born now loaded with radiation

544
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:16,280
and people don't realize this

545
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,780
it takes time and commitment I got a

546
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:25,340
comment right on here on what is it

547
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:29,100
YouTube Zoe Cox snake oil salesman

548
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:31,080
whoa how smart are you Zoe Cox and how

549
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:33,480
original are you too

550
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:37,020
snake oil salesman

551
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:38,820
the irony is if you skinned a snake and

552
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:40,860
squeezed out the oil it would probably

553
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:44,480
be more medicinal than anything you're

554
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:44,480
doing or recommending anyone

555
00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:49,140
but thank you for the comment I like the

556
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:50,640
Charlton comments and the snake oil

557
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:53,039
salesman comments those are actually my

558
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:56,720
favorite because they're classics

559
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:56,720
and they're kind of funny

560
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:03,240
it takes time and commitment to an

561
00:24:00,179 --> 00:24:05,100
anti-radiation protocol namely

562
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:08,100
the medical medium

563
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:12,380
heavy metal detox smoothie which is also

564
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:12,380
a radiation yanker

565
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:18,000
isn't it incredible

566
00:24:15,179 --> 00:24:20,700
so you can say goodbye to it

567
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,400
that's actually really funny that

568
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:25,860
SOC put it in this way I'm reading this

569
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:28,080
it takes time a commitment to an

570
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:29,580
anti-radiation protocol namely the

571
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,380
medical medium heavy metal detox

572
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:34,980
smoothie which is also a radiation

573
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:37,500
yanker to say goodbye to it

574
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:39,360
that's it

575
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:40,679
these books are so big and there's so

576
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:43,140
much information in them and everything

577
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:44,460
that I like I forget

578
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:47,780
like

579
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:47,780
different parts to it and everything

580
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:55,440
don't worry

581
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:57,659
Zoe Cox or whatever your name was

582
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:00,419
you will get sick someday

583
00:24:57,659 --> 00:25:02,820
and you'll go through the merry-go-round

584
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:04,679
and you'll go through all this crap I'm

585
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:07,380
gonna hope you don't get sick

586
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:08,820
but you go through all this crap and

587
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:11,340
then you'll be at the medical medium

588
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:13,740
books looking for answers

589
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:16,380
yeah I'm sure you won't tell anybody

590
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:18,600
about it I'll still be a dirty Secret

591
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:20,700
but whatever

592
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:23,240
medical exam protective measures so

593
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:23,240
check this out

594
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:28,559
lead bibs

595
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:30,900
provide it for dental X-rays provide a

596
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:32,580
facade of Total Protection

597
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:35,220
it's not a nice thing for me to say but

598
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:38,279
to know my daughter went for an x-ray

599
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:40,020
and I told them to apron her they said

600
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:42,320
research shows that the apron isn't

601
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:42,320
needed

602
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:45,320
foreign

603
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:57,080
freaking need another one here

604
00:25:57,299 --> 00:26:01,100
I can't tell you how upset that gets me

605
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:07,820
I can't even tell you're upset

606
00:26:09,059 --> 00:26:14,940
it's just it's just screwed up

607
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:14,940
foreign

608
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:22,320
I'm the only person in alternative

609
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:24,120
medicine and conventional medicine that

610
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,559
actually gives it crap and and talks

611
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:27,000
about the lead bibs and everything I

612
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:29,039
know and no one talks about them out

613
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,740
there oh but I'm the charlatan I'm the

614
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:34,320
I'm the snake oil sales

615
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:37,080
love holistic health says I had to have

616
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:39,240
an x-ray to my entire head for a dental

617
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:43,340
implant and three months later my

618
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:43,340
reading vision went down the drain

619
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:51,179
so I'm saying this right here and I said

620
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:53,039
well I feel bad and I said this right

621
00:26:51,179 --> 00:26:55,140
here lead bibs provide it but it's the

622
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:57,240
truth so what am I going to do let bibs

623
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:59,400
provided for dental X-rays provide a

624
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:02,220
facade of Total Protection they usually

625
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:04,799
don't provide enough coverage

626
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:06,720
because it's true they don't cover the

627
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:08,580
person enough

628
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,679
I'm not trying to be mean to any

629
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:13,380
dentists or anything of the sort we need

630
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:16,080
dentists do we need doctors I get it but

631
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:18,480
but I don't I'm not trying to be

632
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:22,380
purposefully

633
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:25,260
mean it's just the truth so I recommend

634
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:27,779
asking for additional protection and try

635
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:30,679
to get one bib a little higher to

636
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:30,679
protect your thyroid

637
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:35,220
can I have an extra bid please an extra

638
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:37,740
bib

639
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:40,020
can I move the bib up higher to my

640
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:42,720
thyroid please

641
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:45,000
ajana says holistic dentists are no

642
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,559
better and I agree with you 100 lots of

643
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,980
trendy traps

644
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:53,600
and still too much radiation ajada

645
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:53,600
totally totally agree

646
00:27:56,039 --> 00:28:00,120
aim is true if you're getting an x-ray

647
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:03,179
at a medical facility

648
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:04,980
whether an x-ray of the chest

649
00:28:03,179 --> 00:28:07,940
or neck

650
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:07,940
or elsewhere

651
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:15,480
ask for extra gear for protection is it

652
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:17,820
my freaking imagination

653
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:18,600
or can you find all the eat better books

654
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:19,980
out there because these aren't eat

655
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:22,320
better books these are way above all

656
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:24,539
that even in the ebayer books all these

657
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:26,520
years can you find that who's putting

658
00:28:24,539 --> 00:28:29,400
that out there and what podcast doctor

659
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:31,559
is even talking about that

660
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:33,360
oh oh they'll be talking about it

661
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:35,039
tomorrow though that's right because the

662
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,360
books just you know got out there in the

663
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:38,100
world and

664
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:40,740
and they steal information from the

665
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:42,900
lives and whatever in the videos

666
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:46,140
and don't cite it

667
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:48,900
ask for extra gear for protection beyond

668
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:50,880
what they offer normally for other parts

669
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:52,799
of your body not just the part of the

670
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:56,539
body immediately surrounding the area

671
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:59,400
being x-rayed on IG let's see

672
00:28:56,539 --> 00:29:03,260
Shamrocks and sunflower says you're

673
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:03,260
helping me so much explanation points

674
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:08,600
and I think there were four exclamation

675
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:08,600
points or three

676
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:11,880
thank you

677
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,140
this lemon bomb is starting to calm me

678
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:16,020
down a little bit because that's what

679
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:17,220
lemon balm is it's common if

680
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:20,220
and

681
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:23,279
like when you're using something really

682
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:25,320
potent and really high quality you can

683
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:27,860
always feel it that's what's incredible

684
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,860
about it

685
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:33,539
so many sources of medical exam

686
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:37,440
radiation are hard to avoid

687
00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:40,620
it's part of the process of seeking help

688
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:42,240
I'm not telling you to not seek help

689
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:44,640
you break your leg you're going to need

690
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:46,679
an x-ray

691
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:48,659
when people are looking for answers they

692
00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:50,760
go to the doctor with a complaint and

693
00:29:48,659 --> 00:29:53,179
the doctor writes a prescription for an

694
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,179
x-ray

695
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:57,480
CAT scan

696
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:02,399
or MRI

697
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:05,600
MRI does admit does admit a certain

698
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:05,600
amount of radiation

699
00:30:06,299 --> 00:30:11,700
from chess Rex from chest x-rays to

700
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:14,820
diagnose lung issues such as bronchitis

701
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:17,159
and pneumonia to arm x-rays to diagnose

702
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:19,140
broken bones bursitis or whatever in the

703
00:30:17,159 --> 00:30:22,020
shoulder this is where our current

704
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:25,679
medical system is

705
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:28,799
and yet rarely if ever in the X-ray and

706
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:33,299
scanning world do they ever offer a lead

707
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:35,820
Helmet or protective headpiece

708
00:30:33,299 --> 00:30:37,679
too expensive to order them and buy them

709
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:40,380
is the medical industry just doesn't

710
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:43,740
have enough money

711
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:47,580
the medical industry is too poor

712
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:49,320
to actually create and Order up some

713
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:53,720
lead helmets

714
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:53,720
but no uh they can't afford that

715
00:30:56,360 --> 00:31:01,679
octop Corp

716
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:04,080
hey there you are the apron is loaded

717
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:08,159
with radiation as well because they use

718
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:11,159
the same one over and over laptop

719
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:11,159
incredible

720
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:15,419
incredible octop also followed up with

721
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:18,140
her other comment shortly after that

722
00:31:15,419 --> 00:31:18,140
said pink phone

723
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:26,880
if the pink phone rings I will answer it

724
00:31:21,899 --> 00:31:29,100
and talk to that Zoe Cox person

725
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:31,320
still better to have an apron that's got

726
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:33,720
radiation in it a lead apron that's got

727
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:37,220
radiation in it then not having one it's

728
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:37,220
still better keep that in mind

729
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:43,919
so with the pneumonia and arm x-rays to

730
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:46,500
diagnose broken bones this is where our

731
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:48,720
current medical system is and yet rarely

732
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:50,460
if ever in the X-ray and scanning world

733
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:53,399
do they offer a lead Helmet or

734
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:57,720
protective headpiece no so our brains

735
00:31:53,399 --> 00:32:00,179
are left exposed purposely I believe is

736
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:01,679
it wrong for me to think purposely or do

737
00:32:00,179 --> 00:32:03,299
you think I think with all the signs of

738
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:05,700
research and all the brainiacs and

739
00:32:03,299 --> 00:32:07,980
Geniuses and scientists that we have

740
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:10,620
that come out of elite elite Schools

741
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:13,140
they're so smart do you think they just

742
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:14,940
somehow forgot no they wouldn't have

743
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:16,500
forgot that we need lead helmets with

744
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:19,380
all these x-rays to protect your brain

745
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:21,380
no so they're doing it on purpose

746
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:25,500
foreign

747
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:27,320
ER says sad but true former TSA Employee

748
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:29,100
here whoa

749
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:32,279
whoa

750
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:34,740
I wish I knew what airport you worked at

751
00:32:32,279 --> 00:32:37,440
when you were at on TSA because I always

752
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:38,940
get help off to the side and they go

753
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,100
through my bags

754
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:43,679
and I wouldn't need I needed you I

755
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:46,140
needed you sad but true former TSA

756
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:48,299
Employee here the sad part is we were

757
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:51,179
more exposed to radiation than anyone

758
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:54,299
else big time I lost a lot of co-workers

759
00:32:51,179 --> 00:32:57,360
from cancers and strokes teach

760
00:32:54,299 --> 00:33:00,120
I totally understand I

761
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:01,200
me and SOC had conversations about it

762
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:04,380
every time I was in an airport

763
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:07,500
constantly about you guys and your job

764
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:09,919
like I always felt for you guys always

765
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,919
did

766
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:15,659
always did oh my God my family my

767
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:17,519
friends know because I've always talked

768
00:33:15,659 --> 00:33:20,840
about that very thing that you you know

769
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:20,840
being a TSA officer

770
00:33:21,539 --> 00:33:26,279
and I wish I knew you when you were

771
00:33:23,159 --> 00:33:28,140
working there at whatever airport I

772
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:30,659
would have liked to teach here

773
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:33,960
hey it's TJ it's teach is teach here

774
00:33:30,659 --> 00:33:37,019
she's working today

775
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:39,000
me tube787 says we produce poisons then

776
00:33:37,019 --> 00:33:40,740
we make more poisons to check for more

777
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,779
poisons than we're recommended more

778
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:44,820
poisons to combat the poisons what a

779
00:33:42,779 --> 00:33:46,080
crazy world and then we're recommended

780
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:47,640
to get blood work because we're sick

781
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,960
from the poisons and then we get sicker

782
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:50,279
from the blood work and they recommend

783
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,840
more blood work because we're sick for

784
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:53,519
the voices and sick from the blood work

785
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:55,260
and then they recommend more blood work

786
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:56,700
and then when we're just about dead and

787
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:58,620
we're laying there we can't even move

788
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:59,700
they actually say you're going to need

789
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:01,260
more blood work because we don't know

790
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:03,179
why you're dying so they take more blood

791
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:05,640
out of us and they make us sicker sicker

792
00:34:03,179 --> 00:34:08,779
and next thing you do it

793
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:08,779
they try to kill us

794
00:34:10,619 --> 00:34:14,940
I'm not anti-blood work done properly

795
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:18,440
I'm not anti-doctor go to your doctor

796
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:18,440
ask your doctor what's right for you

797
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:24,139
I have a lot of doctor friends

798
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:30,020
I don't know my spot I have to find it

799
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:34,520
so hang on

800
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:34,520
SOC saying get somewhere down here

801
00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:39,720
and yet rarely if ever in the X-ray and

802
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:40,919
scanning world do they offer you a lead

803
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:43,379
helmet

804
00:34:40,919 --> 00:34:45,419
or protective headpiece so our brains

805
00:34:43,379 --> 00:34:47,220
are left exposed

806
00:34:45,419 --> 00:34:49,139
wild blueberry girl says that was a

807
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:51,419
surgical tech for six years and they

808
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:54,540
would sometimes do x-rays in surgery

809
00:34:51,419 --> 00:34:58,580
would just say for us to turn around and

810
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:58,580
step 10 feet away still in the room

811
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:07,099
and I 100 percent believe that because I

812
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:07,099
have heard that before

813
00:35:08,099 --> 00:35:14,220
and I know that's 100 accurate

814
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:15,839
I wouldn't need to have heard it before

815
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:18,240
to know it's accurate because I know

816
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:20,099
you're telling me exactly what happened

817
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,720
but I've actually heard that

818
00:35:20,099 --> 00:35:24,920
unbelievable

819
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:24,920
thank you for saying that

820
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:28,980
that's why it's important for us to ask

821
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:31,500
for additional bibs to help Shield the

822
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:34,380
areas of the body we can and to work on

823
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:37,740
the radiation removal protocols in this

824
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:39,780
book spirulina

825
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:42,359
or spirulina

826
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:44,400
a key ingredient in medical medium

827
00:35:42,359 --> 00:35:47,060
protocols is essential for radiation

828
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,060
exposure

829
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:49,700
foreign

830
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:57,300
awareness teach I might have put

831
00:35:54,359 --> 00:35:59,099
something in here SOG SOC might have put

832
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:02,820
some in there

833
00:35:59,099 --> 00:36:04,619
Jackie I need that lemon balm 2aw they

834
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:07,920
didn't put an apron on my son yesterday

835
00:36:04,619 --> 00:36:10,339
even though I told him to ask crap crap

836
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,339
crap

837
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:14,060
I totally understand

838
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:24,440
I'm gonna put a

839
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:24,440
Chopper full straight in

840
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:34,500
goes into your bloodstream really fast

841
00:36:32,099 --> 00:36:37,619
Heidi Inman

842
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:41,060
this knowledge is gold

843
00:36:37,619 --> 00:36:41,060
three explanation points

844
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:46,280
airport awareness all right let's let's

845
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:49,260
uh let's get rolling

846
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:51,359
medical medium information has always

847
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:54,240
warned about radiation contamination

848
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:56,280
from airports and air travel

849
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:58,680
there is so much radiation being

850
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:02,839
admitted in airports that it would set

851
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:02,839
off radiation detection technology

852
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:08,099
what about fear you guys and Chaos this

853
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:10,260
isn't about fear it's about knowing what

854
00:37:08,099 --> 00:37:13,260
what you're up against so you can make a

855
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:14,940
decision and have a choice

856
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:16,140
I think it's critical to have a choice

857
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:17,940
and to know what you're up against you

858
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:20,760
can protect yourself at least work on

859
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:23,460
radiation protocols at least but the

860
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:25,020
point is that you actually have a form

861
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:26,579
of knowledge or you've got the

862
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:28,079
empowerment empowerment is about

863
00:37:26,579 --> 00:37:30,560
knowledge it's about knowing what's

864
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,560
going on

865
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:34,680
no changes are going to be made if you

866
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:36,900
don't know what's happening and you

867
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:39,180
don't know what's going on

868
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:41,900
can't make a change if you don't if you

869
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:41,900
can't make a choice

870
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:47,160
there's so much radiation being admitted

871
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:49,859
in airports that it would actually set

872
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:52,500
off detection radiation detection to

873
00:37:49,859 --> 00:37:55,560
technology get the words right aw while

874
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:58,260
you were while you were walking through

875
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:59,760
the rows of passengers waiting for their

876
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:02,339
flights

877
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:04,680
the device would go wild picking up

878
00:38:02,339 --> 00:38:07,920
radiation from all the freshly scanned

879
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:10,859
people and knapsacks and carry-ons fresh

880
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:13,020
off the scanner conveyor belts not now

881
00:38:10,859 --> 00:38:15,180
contaminated that's why it's good to be

882
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:16,619
aware and proactive okay I just

883
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:18,180
butchered that paragraph but I have to

884
00:38:16,619 --> 00:38:21,960
tell you something and this is important

885
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:25,440
first of all people who say I'm a fear

886
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:27,599
Monger are so off the mark

887
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:30,180
so are we all supposed to just never

888
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:32,520
know anything don't know about how to

889
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:35,520
guard yourself when you get a blood test

890
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:37,560
don't know how to get radiation out of

891
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:39,960
your body don't know how to ask for some

892
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:42,300
protected bibs when you go and get a

893
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:45,540
procedure done

894
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:47,700
an x-ray or you know

895
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:49,380
um not talk about the truth about why

896
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:51,540
people are sick so you never know why

897
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:54,720
anybody got sick like am I supposed to

898
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:58,380
just hide everything not give anybody

899
00:38:54,720 --> 00:39:00,420
any information and so so I don't put

900
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:02,040
anybody in fear

901
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:04,380
meanwhile

902
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:06,900
people are actually working on healing

903
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:08,700
with the medical medium info

904
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:10,380
I'm doing in these incredible recipes

905
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:12,900
and then someone will come along and be

906
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:15,660
like orthorexia he's making you

907
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:17,280
orthorexic okay then it's fine to go eat

908
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:20,339
go eat whatever you want out there in

909
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:22,740
the world don't think about your your

910
00:39:20,339 --> 00:39:24,839
your sickness and your problems and

911
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:25,619
don't try to fix it go eat whatever you

912
00:39:24,839 --> 00:39:28,380
want

913
00:39:25,619 --> 00:39:31,440
go do whatever you want

914
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:33,119
and it's not about that like mm info you

915
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:35,220
could do anything you want but it's here

916
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:37,140
for you when you want to partake in

917
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:39,300
turning your life around when you want

918
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:41,839
answers and you want to help yourself

919
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:41,839
heal

920
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:51,240
for one luggage

921
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:53,460
okay this is interesting too I just want

922
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:56,359
to say this

923
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:56,359
in the airport

924
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:02,460
if you had radiation technology

925
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:04,800
detectors

926
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:06,540
it would be it would show levels of

927
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:08,280
radiation

928
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:10,200
elevated radiation

929
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:13,099
from the amount of exposure that happens

930
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:13,099
in the airports

931
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:17,579
for one luggage has to be discarded and

932
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:19,560
purchased new periodically

933
00:40:17,579 --> 00:40:21,240
that's a medical medium recommendation

934
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:24,240
you don't have to do that recommendation

935
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:26,880
but that's a medical meme recommendation

936
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:30,359
luggage has to be discarded and

937
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:33,599
purchased new periodically when not in

938
00:40:30,359 --> 00:40:35,820
use keep luggage that has been on a

939
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:38,240
flight far away from your children and

940
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:38,240
pets

941
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,680
because the luggage goes through the

942
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:46,260
scanners

943
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:48,180
and it's getting radiated heavy radiated

944
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:50,160
right the luggage collects that

945
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:53,940
radiation and keeps that radiation long

946
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:57,000
term so if you store that luggage and

947
00:40:53,940 --> 00:41:00,180
that carry-on in those suitcases

948
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:02,700
by say your baby's crib or in a Closet

949
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:04,800
near your child or you know near your

950
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:06,060
child's bed or whatever it is if you're

951
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,740
storing it you have to be careful you

952
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:09,119
have to get that that luggage out of

953
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:10,940
there store it somewhere else if you

954
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:14,099
don't want to throw it out I'm in page

955
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:16,380
239 right here in brain saver just

956
00:41:14,099 --> 00:41:19,220
letting you guys know and Airport

957
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:19,220
awareness

958
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:24,480
luggage has to be discarded and

959
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:26,700
purchased new periodically when not in

960
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:29,160
use keep luggage that has been on

961
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:32,400
flights away from children and pets for

962
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:34,700
an for another when you're going through

963
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,700
security

964
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:42,500
opt out of the full body scanner and ask

965
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:42,500
for a pat down instead

966
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:49,079
so there's a scanning machine

967
00:41:46,619 --> 00:41:51,960
there at the airport

968
00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:54,000
it's not the metal detector

969
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:55,740
the metal detector kind of just looks

970
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,680
like this gray thing that's like this

971
00:41:55,740 --> 00:42:00,359
right it's like a Gateway and you just

972
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:02,820
walk right through that's the metal

973
00:42:00,359 --> 00:42:05,940
detector there at the airport

974
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:08,460
okay that has no radiation coming out of

975
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:10,440
it that's detecting from metal objects

976
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:12,660
right

977
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:15,599
but there's a scanner at the airport

978
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:18,540
where you stand there and the doors

979
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:20,040
revolve and a scan happens

980
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:21,720
there's a couple of different scanners

981
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:24,240
they have their different makes and

982
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:25,680
models but there's a scanner

983
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:28,859
now you can do what you want whatever

984
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:31,140
but I tell my friends and my family

985
00:42:28,859 --> 00:42:33,119
to not do the scanner

986
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:36,900
to just get a pat down

987
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:39,780
so you ask he kindly asked tiesters can

988
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:41,400
you give me a pat down

989
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:43,680
and they fill you up

990
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:44,880
they put their hands everywhere

991
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:48,780
wherever

992
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:51,720
but the point is is that you you don't

993
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:53,700
have to then do the scanner if you stay

994
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:55,680
on the side so they'll ask you well put

995
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:57,420
your arms up

996
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,560
Sarah put your arms up ma'am put your

997
00:42:57,420 --> 00:43:00,540

spread your legs

999
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:05,599
and you spread your legs and they pat

1000
00:43:02,819 --> 00:43:05,599
down your body

1001
00:43:09,619 --> 00:43:16,079

to be a nuclear engineer whoa and

1013
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:54,780
probably got way more exposure

1014
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:56,640
than what they told us so grateful for

1015
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:59,099
this information to know how to protect

1016
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:00,960
myself incredible

1017
00:43:59,099 --> 00:44:03,180

smartest group of people out there are

1021
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:11,099
in the medical medium community

1022
00:44:08,339 --> 00:44:14,220
Amanda accusing someone of orthorexia

1023
00:44:11,099 --> 00:44:17,099
while they're using mm protocols to hell

1024
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:19,200
to heal is evil

1025
00:44:17,099 --> 00:44:20,640
I'm butchering comments today I can make

1026
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:22,740
these comments right

1027
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:24,780
I will read that one over though

1028
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:26,700
because that one blows my mind

1029
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:29,280
Amanda says accusing someone of

1030
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:31,859
orthorexia while they're using medical

1031
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:33,599
medium protocols to heal is evil and

1032
00:44:31,859 --> 00:44:34,920
that's true okay I want to talk about

1033
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:36,540
that one second

1034
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:39,420
that is true

1035
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:43,140
there are even people that end up hating

1036
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:44,880
medical medium because they want to go

1037
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:46,380
and they want to do the whole shark

1038
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:48,119
thing they want to sell all their

1039
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:49,500
programs and sell all their stuff and

1040
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:51,960
they healed with medical medium

1041
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:54,180
information and then

1042
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:57,060
to lead people their way for their

1043
00:44:54,180 --> 00:45:00,000
programs and everything they try to diss

1044
00:44:57,060 --> 00:45:02,640
medical media and be like oh he's he's

1045
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:05,640

1046
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:08,940
my come over to my feed in my programs

1047
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:13,220
and buy my programs I'm not like him

1048
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:13,220
he's a jerk he's terrible

1049
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:18,780
all right

1050
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:21,000
for another when you're going through

1051
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:23,460
security opt out of the full body

1052
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:25,920
scanner and ask for a pat down instead

1053
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:28,079
it's perfectly safe to walk through a

1054
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:31,440
plain metal detector

1055
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:33,900
it's the airport body scanner device you

1056
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:35,940
want to avoid

1057
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:37,560
as you're waiting for your pat down try

1058
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:39,480
not to lean against the radiation

1059
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:41,880
machine that's being used to examine

1060
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:43,319
carry-ons did you hear that

1061
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:45,540
critical

1062
00:45:43,319 --> 00:45:47,520
this is critical teach you know you know

1063
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:50,819
the machine I'm talking about right

1064
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:53,640
you got to know that machine

1065
00:45:50,819 --> 00:45:56,940
as you're waiting for your pat down

1066
00:45:53,640 --> 00:46:00,240
try not to lean against the radiation

1067
00:45:56,940 --> 00:46:02,220
machine that's being used to examine

1068
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:04,140
carry-ons

1069
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:06,119
so you're waiting for your pat down and

1070
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:09,000
they'll be like stand here sir ma'am

1071
00:46:06,119 --> 00:46:11,579
stand here right and when they when you

1072
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,440
go to stand there you might stand really

1073
00:46:11,579 --> 00:46:15,000
close to the radiation machine so you

1074
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:17,420
got to kind of like just stand a few

1075
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,420
feet away

1076
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:26,280
try to stay on a few feet or more away

1077
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:29,359
from the machine that's processing and

1078
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:29,359
irritating baggage

1079
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:34,800
this is interesting I want to read this

1090
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:04,760
do you believe that there are aliens

flying in our atmosphere

1092
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:09,859
in spacecrafts

1093
00:47:06,599 --> 00:47:09,859
do you believe in any of that

1094
00:47:12,359 --> 00:47:15,720
you don't have to believe in aliens you

1095
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:17,040
don't have to believe that there are

1096
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:19,200
real sightings out there you don't have

1097
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:21,240

extra terrestrial space travel

1117
00:47:57,780 --> 00:48:03,060
what some might call alien ships

1118
00:48:00,599 --> 00:48:06,200
also leave radiation in the atmosphere

1119
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:06,200
as they pass through

1120
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:10,980
isn't that incredible

1121
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:13,440
Who would know that

1122
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:16,380
I haven't heard anybody talk about that

1123
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:18,480
that radiation is increasing because of

1124
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:20,640
alien space travel but I haven't heard

1125
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:22,079
anybody talk about that Spirit of

1126
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:23,579
compassion put that piece of information

1127
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:26,520
in there

1128
00:48:23,579 --> 00:48:28,880
of course I was asking for some cool

1129
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:28,880
stuff

1130
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:33,500
I was like Spirit compassion can you

1131
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:35,940
give me some cool stuff

1132
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:37,740
neurotoxins is getting so boring yes I

1133
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:39,180
know neurotoxins caused so many problems

1134
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:41,760
with everybody's illnesses at chronic

1135
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:43,380
fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia I know

1136
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:44,940
Epstein-Barr creates multiple sclerosis

1137
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:48,260
and all these things but give me some

1138
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:48,260
cool stuff we're on radiation

1139
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:53,280
and snc said extraterrestrial space

1140
00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:55,319
travel which some might call alien ships

1141
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:57,300
also leave radiation in the atmosphere

1142
00:48:55,319 --> 00:49:01,319
as they pass through

1143
00:48:57,300 --> 00:49:02,280
so we're having radiation exposure from

1144
00:49:01,319 --> 00:49:04,859
ETS

1145
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:06,359
passing through all those sightings all

1146
00:49:04,859 --> 00:49:08,220
the spacecrafts that are on this planet

1147
00:49:06,359 --> 00:49:11,099
that are flying around in the atmosphere

1148
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:12,540
they're spreading a lot of radiation

1149
00:49:11,099 --> 00:49:14,819
here we are working worried about

1150
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:18,020
climate climate climb climate what no

1151
00:49:14,819 --> 00:49:18,020
one's even talking about this

1152
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:26,099
UFO sightings are not totally understood

1153
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:27,660
sure they are the radiation coming from

1154
00:49:26,099 --> 00:49:30,000
these crafts

1155
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:32,220
is not the normal radiation we

1156
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,800
experience here

1157
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:36,960
rather it's radiation of another kind

1158
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:39,540
that gets into the atmosphere so here's

1159
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:42,420
the Killer part that was mind-blowing

1160
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:43,500
for me it's not just the thought of that

1161
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:45,359
we're getting all this radiation

1162
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:47,940
exposure from the amount of alien

1163
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:49,380
spacecraft travel happening around the

1164
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:52,500
planet

1165
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:54,900
but it's the type of radiation it's a

1166
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:57,660
different form of radiation

1167
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:59,220
then what we're creating down here so

1168
00:49:57,660 --> 00:50:01,680
there's two kinds of radiation affecting

1169
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:04,680
us what we're creating down here

1170
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:06,960
and then the radiation

1171
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:08,520
that's actually entering through space

1172
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:11,180
travel

1173
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:11,180
spacecraft

1174
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:21,140
that's incredible really

1175
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:35,720
um JL says aw thanks so much

1176
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:39,599

1177
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:42,060
medicated drugs including penicillin and

1178
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:46,400
anti-seizure meds because of the medical

1179
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:46,400
medium books thanks SOC

incredible

1190
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:17,760
you guys I shall now get into radiation

1191
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:19,859
exposure shot

1192
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:22,520
Branch out therapy

1193
00:51:19,859 --> 00:51:22,520
here we are

1194
00:51:24,119 --> 00:51:28,859
there's a IG comment that podcast

1195
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:30,480
episode was mind altering mermail says

1196
00:51:28,859 --> 00:51:32,579
You must be talking about the alien

1197
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:34,020
podcast episode medical meme podcast at

1198
00:51:32,579 --> 00:51:38,520
Apple podcast

1199
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:42,380
the alien episode that was definitely a

1200
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:42,380
really powerful episode

1201
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:48,420
this is a supported it a supportive shot

1202
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:50,819
for circumstances such as airplane

1203
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:52,920
travel

1204
00:51:50,819 --> 00:51:57,859
walking through airports or being close

1205
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:57,859
to airport scanners or baggage scanners

1206
00:51:58,020 --> 00:52:03,000
being close to luggage that has gone

1207
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:06,440
through airport scanners

1208
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:10,020
medical testing such as CT scans X-rays

1209
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:12,599
fluoroscopy and even MRIS

1210
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:15,059
being around others who have had medical

1211
00:52:12,599 --> 00:52:17,579
testing such as CAT scans X-rays

1212
00:52:15,059 --> 00:52:20,700
fluoroscopy and MRIS

1213
00:52:17,579 --> 00:52:22,619
exposure to computerized devices

1214
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:24,839
I got no exposure to computerized

1215
00:52:22,619 --> 00:52:28,319
devices

1216
00:52:24,839 --> 00:52:30,660
not I do have exposure to computerized

1217
00:52:28,319 --> 00:52:33,420
devices

1218
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:36,059
and this radiation exposure shot is good

1219
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:39,180
after a sunburn

1220
00:52:36,059 --> 00:52:40,500
that's another time you can use it

1221
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:42,780
hmm

1222
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:45,599
with all that all the time I have in the

1223
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:50,579
world to just go out

1224
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:53,880
in my swimsuit and bathe sunbathe in the

1225
00:52:50,579 --> 00:52:56,400
Sun for hours

1226
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:58,260
I don't have any time to do that but

1227
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:01,400
don't do that for hours that's not a

1228
00:52:58,260 --> 00:53:01,400
good idea don't do that for hours

1229
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:08,960
all right

1230
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:08,960
we are doing the radiation exposure shot

1231
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:18,059
comment if really kicked in but what it

1232
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:19,380
has done it has calmed me down so much

1233
00:53:18,059 --> 00:53:25,140
because

1234
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:28,099
I took a decent amount in my

1235
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:28,099
hot water here

1236
00:53:28,619 --> 00:53:33,359
but it's definitely

1237
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:35,880
really calmed me down

1238
00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:38,819
that's my experience in the moment

1239
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:41,099
happening right now CD says hi Anthony

1240
00:53:38,819 --> 00:53:43,559
so happy to have you around I wouldn't

1241
00:53:41,099 --> 00:53:46,800
be where I am today without you

1242
00:53:43,559 --> 00:53:48,059
are all the energy products safe while

1243
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:52,500
pregnant

1244
00:53:48,059 --> 00:53:55,319
it's just cut those guys those guys talk

1245
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:56,819
um those guys communicate I mean just

1246
00:53:55,319 --> 00:53:59,280
reach out to the emergency company ask

1247
00:53:56,819 --> 00:54:01,559
them any questions you need to ask them

1248
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:04,559
but check with your doctor that's easy

1249
00:54:01,559 --> 00:54:07,760
because your situation

1250
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:07,760
and she'd always ask your doctor

1251
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:17,480
well

1252
00:54:12,599 --> 00:54:17,480

00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:45,260
say I feel your energy

1263
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:49,790
[Applause]

1264
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:53,660
foreign

1265
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:03,660
we got the machine running

1266
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:05,400
so I'm starting out with the cilantro

1267
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:09,500
first

1268
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:09,500
half cup tightly packed cilantro

1269
00:55:13,319 --> 00:55:21,540
I got my cilantro right here this is

1270
00:55:17,339 --> 00:55:24,680
radiation exposure brain shot therapy

1271
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:24,680
is what this is

1272
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:33,200
getting my cilantro down in here

1273
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:41,400
now I'm using

1274
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:43,680
the wild blueberry powder you can do

1275
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:45,660
frozen wild blueberries fresh wild

1276
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:47,760
blueberries a half cup of Frozen or

1277
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:49,800
fresh you can choose to do that you can

1278
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:53,819
do two tablespoons of wild blueberry

1279
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:57,319
juice or one tablespoon of the wild

1280
00:55:53,819 --> 00:55:57,319
blueberry powder right here

1281
00:55:57,839 --> 00:56:02,240
but I'm going to go with the asparagus

1282
00:55:59,819 --> 00:56:02,240
right now

1283
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:06,480
because I want to make sure I'm able to

1284
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:09,020
mix that in because I'm going to go with

1285
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:09,020
the powder

1286
00:56:13,319 --> 00:56:20,819
I love juicing asparagus it is actually

1287
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:23,220
like one of my favorites

1288
00:56:20,819 --> 00:56:27,180
these are small Spears

1289
00:56:23,220 --> 00:56:30,420
it says four raw medium Spears

1290
00:56:27,180 --> 00:56:31,980
and I've seen Spears that big like just

1291
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:34,079
large ones and these are actually really

1292
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:39,180
tiny so I'm going to put a few in there

1293
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:41,520
all right one stalk of celery please

1294
00:56:39,180 --> 00:56:43,859
such nice celery right here I like when

1295
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:46,680
I have nice celery you know how it can

1296
00:56:43,859 --> 00:56:48,900
come spindly lots of leaves and just

1297
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:51,720
really spindly right just really nice

1298
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:54,500
celery right here

1299
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:54,500
we go

1300
00:56:55,140 --> 00:57:00,420
we got just enough for a shot

1301
00:56:57,780 --> 00:57:03,260
now I can mix in a couple of things here

1302
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:03,260
which is going to be

1303
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:08,180
I'm just making sure this gets all the

1304
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:08,180
juice out

1305
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:11,720
nice

1306
00:57:12,359 --> 00:57:16,280
all right then we're going to mix this

1307
00:57:13,859 --> 00:57:16,280
in here

1308
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:22,040
right

1309
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:25,440
next thing is

1310
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:27,900
blueberry powder

1311
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:30,140
one tablespoon

1312
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:33,240
I'm gonna get a measuring

1313
00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:36,380
spoon here

1314
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:36,380
one tablespoon

1315
00:57:37,619 --> 00:57:41,940
this is incredible by the way

1316
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:44,720
so that's the vimergi wild blueberry

1317
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:44,720
powder right there

1318
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:48,680
gonna drop that in

1319
00:57:49,559 --> 00:57:53,119
now I'm going to add

1320
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:58,520
some spirulina

1321
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:05,940
spirulina is half

1322
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:09,380
tablespoon I think it's a half teaspoon

1323
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:09,380
I think so let me get that that's

1324
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:13,640
nice

1325
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:17,240
a half teaspoon in there

1326
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:22,460
barley grass juice powder

1327
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:26,760
and bird says hello can I use barley

1328
00:58:25,079 --> 00:58:28,319
grass instead of barley grass juice

1329
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:30,660
powder

1330
00:58:28,319 --> 00:58:32,160
nope it's it's an entirely different

1331
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:36,260
creature it's an entirely different

1332
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:36,260
Beast it it doesn't work

1333
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:43,680
it has to be

1334
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:46,640
the juice powder putting a little bit of

1335
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:46,640
that in there now too

1336
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:55,440
yep

1337
00:58:53,819 --> 00:58:57,480
I'll tell you why because the barley

1338
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:59,700
grass is barley grass it's chopped up

1339
00:58:57,480 --> 00:59:02,700
dehydrated grass

1340
00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:06,240
so there's no potency to it it's just

1341
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:07,500
straight grass and it's also irritating

1342
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:08,819
for a lot of people with their

1343
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:11,520
intestinal tracts because it's

1344
00:59:08,819 --> 00:59:14,099
scratching grass but if here's the thing

1345
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:16,260
it's scratchy dehydrated grass that's a

1346
00:59:14,099 --> 00:59:18,059
difference that's barley grass barley

1347
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:19,920
grass is not what this is so that's

1348
00:59:18,059 --> 00:59:22,380
really important to know this is barley

1349
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:25,619
grass juice powder it's the extraction

1350
00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:27,960
the juice itself the grass the scratchy

1351
00:59:25,619 --> 00:59:30,480
grass was left behind this is actually

1352
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:32,700
the juice and the juice only so that's

1353
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:34,380
what it is and then you know and then

1354
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:36,480
it's fried right it's dehydrated so it's

1355
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:38,880
the barley grass juice powder now here's

1356
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:40,260
what's incredible and beverage is the

1357
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:42,119
only company with my knowledge that's

1358
00:59:40,260 --> 00:59:45,859
ever done this they don't have the

1359
00:59:42,119 --> 00:59:50,339
caking agents they do they don't

1360
00:59:45,859 --> 00:59:51,780
apply caking agents or bonding agents

1361
00:59:50,339 --> 00:59:53,160
inside their powder so here's how it

1362
00:59:51,780 --> 00:59:55,559
works all the green powders out there

1363
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:58,799
all the different powders whether it's

1364
00:59:55,559 --> 01:00:00,359
mushroom powders reishi powders chaga

1365
00:59:58,799 --> 01:00:03,720
powders

1366
01:00:00,359 --> 01:00:05,760
um spirulina powders barley grass

1367
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:07,260
powders whatever whatever powders that

1368
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:09,299
are out there vegetable and fruit

1369
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:11,040
powders all the different powders that

1370
01:00:09,299 --> 01:00:12,720
are out there you guys there's hundreds

1371
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:14,099
of companies doing powders now just

1372
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:17,720
powder everything

1373
01:00:14,099 --> 01:00:21,540
there there are undisclosed

1374
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:23,579
bonding agents to stop the powder from

1375
01:00:21,540 --> 01:00:25,619
sticking together

1376
01:00:23,579 --> 01:00:27,720
that means the companies that have all

1377
01:00:25,619 --> 01:00:28,859
these different powders out there think

1378
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:30,599
about this

1379
01:00:28,859 --> 01:00:33,720
all the different powders have an

1380
01:00:30,599 --> 01:00:38,400
ingredient or ingredients that you don't

1381
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:42,420
know about that's a non-caking agent

1382
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:46,200
so it's a non-bonding agent so they put

1383
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:48,660
these these anti-bonding agents and

1384
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:51,540
caking agents into the powders so you're

1385
01:00:48,660 --> 01:00:53,520
like oh you know my my you know my

1386
01:00:51,540 --> 01:00:55,020
person here told me to do these to do

1387
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:58,319
these powders here and here's a green

1388
01:00:55,020 --> 01:01:01,140
powder and here's another powder

1389
01:00:58,319 --> 01:01:03,059
and I got the best powder or I got this

1390
01:01:01,140 --> 01:01:04,319
powder or chlorella but what people

1391
01:01:03,059 --> 01:01:09,359
don't realize

1392
01:01:04,319 --> 01:01:12,420
is they put in the anti-caking agent and

1393
01:01:09,359 --> 01:01:15,839
the anti-bonding agent so that the

1394
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:18,299
powders wouldn't Clump together but they

1395
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:21,059
don't put the ingredient on the bottle

1396
01:01:18,299 --> 01:01:23,700
so when they use the anti-caking agent

1397
01:01:21,059 --> 01:01:25,319
they don't put it on the bottle so when

1398
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:26,819
you read the bottle you're like let's

1399
01:01:25,319 --> 01:01:29,579
see there's

1400
01:01:26,819 --> 01:01:31,619
spinach in here spinach powder there's

1401
01:01:29,579 --> 01:01:33,540
beet powder there's

1402
01:01:31,619 --> 01:01:35,400
chlorella there's whatever you're

1403
01:01:33,540 --> 01:01:37,160
reading all the ingredients but what

1404
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:39,619
you're not reading is

1405
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:42,240
anti-caking Agent

1406
01:01:39,619 --> 01:01:43,980
anti-bonding agent and you won't read

1407
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:46,380
that on the on the bottle it's

1408
01:01:43,980 --> 01:01:48,180
undisclosed they're allowed to do it the

1409
01:01:46,380 --> 01:01:50,220
emergency swore they would never do that

1410
01:01:48,180 --> 01:01:51,720
so the beverages powders and it's just

1411
01:01:50,220 --> 01:01:54,900
like this across the board with energy

1412
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:57,180
their stuff is unmatched right because

1413
01:01:54,900 --> 01:02:01,559
they

1414
01:01:57,180 --> 01:02:04,920
choose not to ever put the anti-caking

1415
01:02:01,559 --> 01:02:07,859
agents in these powders their mushroom

1416
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:09,839
powders their their green powders they

1417
01:02:07,859 --> 01:02:11,520
don't do that critical to know Kelsey

1418
01:02:09,839 --> 01:02:15,020
box says can you do this shop before an

1419
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:15,020
x-ray to protect yourself I would

1420
01:02:15,180 --> 01:02:19,799
I would if it was me or a family member

1421
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:20,579
and I said I would definitely do it and

1422
01:02:19,799 --> 01:02:22,680
after

1423
01:02:20,579 --> 01:02:24,180
I would do it after

1424
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:26,160
so I just wanted people to know it's

1425
01:02:24,180 --> 01:02:27,200
another reason why I endorsed themergy

1426
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:29,460
and that's critical to understand

1427
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:32,160
because when you think about what that

1428
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:34,619
is it's insane

1429
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:37,020
it's insane

1430
01:02:34,619 --> 01:02:39,299
so

1431
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:41,420
who does that

1432
01:02:39,299 --> 01:02:43,980
I don't care what anybody says

1433
01:02:41,420 --> 01:02:45,540
undisclosed they secretly put they don't

1434
01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:47,579
just tell anybody they put the antibody

1435
01:02:45,540 --> 01:02:48,960
bonding agents in there the details

1436
01:02:47,579 --> 01:02:50,579
matter when it comes down to healing and

1437
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:53,160
that's that's the difference because

1438
01:02:50,579 --> 01:02:54,660
memory is thinking about people who

1439
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:56,040
aren't well they're thinking about their

1440
01:02:54,660 --> 01:02:57,079
customers or think about all these

1441
01:02:56,040 --> 01:03:00,599
things and

1442
01:02:57,079 --> 01:03:04,260
they wouldn't want anti-caking agents

1443
01:03:00,599 --> 01:03:06,299
and anti-bonding agents inside their

1444
01:03:04,260 --> 01:03:09,000
spirulina inside their barley grass

1445
01:03:06,299 --> 01:03:11,220
juice powder inside their chaga powder

1446
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:12,900
inside their Rishi powder whatever they

1447
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:14,819
would never want that in there either

1448
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:16,740
but see it's not about that when it

1449
01:03:14,819 --> 01:03:17,940
comes down to supplements out there in

1450
01:03:16,740 --> 01:03:20,780
the world

1451
01:03:17,940 --> 01:03:20,780
it's just about

1452
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:24,660
bottom line

1453
01:03:22,140 --> 01:03:26,099
people will say oh this made me not feel

1454
01:03:24,660 --> 01:03:28,140
well

1455
01:03:26,099 --> 01:03:29,640
so much of the time that they have they

1456
01:03:28,140 --> 01:03:31,260
don't realize that they have bad quality

1457
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:33,359
products out there with all kinds of

1458
01:03:31,260 --> 01:03:34,440
anti-caking agents and bonding agents

1459
01:03:33,359 --> 01:03:36,359
and

1460
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:39,240
and they don't even know but no don't

1461
01:03:36,359 --> 01:03:43,740
use barley grass powder

1462
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:45,420
barley grass powder is grass that was

1463
01:03:43,740 --> 01:03:47,280
mulched up

1464
01:03:45,420 --> 01:03:50,220
and thrown in there

1465
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:53,280
it's scratchy it's dehydrated

1466
01:03:50,220 --> 01:03:58,280
it doesn't do what it needs to do that's

1467
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:58,280
not barley grass juice powder

1468
01:03:58,319 --> 01:04:02,099
I'm not even going into the quality of

1469
01:04:00,540 --> 01:04:03,960
what these are which is a whole other

1470
01:04:02,099 --> 01:04:06,839
level I could be here all day and and

1471
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:08,640
the quality is insane anyway I'm gonna

1472
01:04:06,839 --> 01:04:10,619
mix this up

1473
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:13,500
I'm just talking about that so if you

1474
01:04:10,619 --> 01:04:15,660
see it clumped if you see a clump in the

1475
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:18,299
in the jar in the bottle you see it

1476
01:04:15,660 --> 01:04:22,400
plump that's what you want you want to

1477
01:04:18,299 --> 01:04:22,400
see it Clump because you don't you know

1478
01:04:28,619 --> 01:04:32,579
that's the whole point it means it

1479
01:04:30,540 --> 01:04:34,079
wasn't the bonding agents weren't added

1480
01:04:32,579 --> 01:04:37,200
in there

1481
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:38,760
the anti-bonding agents all right

1482
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:41,760
we got it

1483
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:41,760
foreign

1484
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:47,220
have I gotten any radiation exposure

1485
01:04:45,359 --> 01:04:50,520
recently

1486
01:04:47,220 --> 01:04:52,860
yeah I have

1684
01:13:42,719 --> 01:13:46,560
won't do that and I never have all right

1685
01:13:45,420 --> 01:13:49,920

cover

1694
01:14:07,380 --> 01:14:13,440
because that radiation topic was very

1695
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:15,000
sad and very depressing but I feel

1696
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:18,420
better though because I'm doing

1697
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:23,400

01:14:18,420 --> 01:14:24,600

I just want to say something you guys

1716
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:05,699
I'm proud of everyone here

1717
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:08,340
more than you guys know

1718
01:15:05,699 --> 01:15:13,320
on IG Lynn Meyer says my two-year-old

1719
01:15:08,340 --> 01:15:16,140
granddaughter crushed her finger ow

1720
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:17,159
my day had to be held hurt I had to hold

1721
01:15:16,140 --> 01:15:20,100
her

1722
01:15:17,159 --> 01:15:23,659
to get the finger x-rayed they didn't

1723
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:23,659
bib either of them

1724
01:15:25,260 --> 01:15:32,040
well this information is so critical

1725
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:34,140
I think over time you know maybe that's

1726
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:36,360
something that will get better out there

1727
01:15:34,140 --> 01:15:38,520
maybe the blood draw issues out there

1728
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:39,840
and the radiation exposure issues out

1729
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:40,920
there and all the different things that

1730
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:42,840
are happening the medical medium

1731
01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:44,219
information is in these books it's out

1732
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:48,360
there

1733
01:15:44,219 --> 01:15:49,380
so like and then they didn't give you a

1734
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:51,659
bib when you were holding your

1735
01:15:49,380 --> 01:15:53,880
granddaughter to

1736
01:15:51,659 --> 01:15:56,640
when you hold your daughter

1737
01:15:53,880 --> 01:16:00,320
has to hold

1738
01:15:56,640 --> 01:16:00,320
