[324.36 - 328.80] canaries
[325.56 - 333.08] they become chemical sensitive
[328.80 - 333.08] they've reached their saturation point
[333.84 - 336.90] think about it for a minute
[335.52 - 339.06] there's a whole bunch of people out
[336.90 - 341.64] there they're like the canaries they've
[339.06 - 344.00] reached their Tipping Point of being
[341.64 - 347.70] able to handle those contaminated
[344.00 - 350.94] dangerous chemical sense produced by
[347.70 - 352.68] chemical factories around the world
[350.94 - 354.18] and they reach their saturation point
[352.68 - 357.18] and then there are the people who love
[354.18 - 359.16] their sense still they haven't reached
[357.18 - 362.10] their saturation point and they're
[359.16 - 364.16] supporting the chemical industry
[362.10 - 366.84] they say they're for the environment
[364.16 - 368.82] meanwhile they're partaking in one of
[366.84 - 370.98] the worst things that's being released
[368.82 - 372.84] into the environment
[370.98 - 375.96] the industry is causing families to
[372.84 - 378.90] fight over this and divide
[375.96 - 382.44] how can sense be more important than our
[378.90 - 385.14] health and our families
[382.44 - 386.34] why is perfume so important why is
[385.14 - 390.02] cologne so important why is air
[386.34 - 390.02] freshener so important why is
[391.56 - 396.54] all the different toxic fragrance stuff
[394.08 - 398.10] that were up against all the time why is
[396.54 - 402.18] it more important than our family
[398.10 - 405.98] members who are really oversaturated by
[402.18 - 405.98] this chemical and they're the canaries
[407.64 - 411.30] people go into battle over it it's
[409.62 - 413.60] really really difficult for so many
[411.30 - 413.60] people
[415.80 - 420.36] so what I wanted to talk to you guys

[444.36 - 451.68] is very difficult to meet people or even
[446.16 - 454.80] to be outside I concur 100 oxymoron with
[451.68 - 457.86] that comment more than you even know
[454.80 - 461.16] actually no you do know what you're
[457.86 - 464.34] singing to the choir or how does it work

[472.14 - 478.92] perfume cologne drink down anti-one down
[476.10 - 481.92] Erica Malek says I've been housebound
[478.92 - 485.04] for six months since my multiple
[481.92 - 488.10] chemical sensitivity has become severe
[485.04 - 490.08] not many people understand not many
[488.10 - 492.18] people do understand
[490.08 - 495.24] they don't
[492.18 - 497.82] shen77 says what's a canary
[495.24 - 499.26] it's an old term for someone basically
[497.82 - 500.40] what happens is that down in the coal
[499.26 - 502.92] mines
[500.40 - 505.02] if they lost oxygen and gases from the
[502.92 - 507.06] earth were taking over they would have a
[505.02 - 509.10] canary sitting in a cage
[507.06 - 511.86] and everybody would be working chipping
[509.10 - 513.90] away that coal mining whatever minerals
[511.86 - 516.00] or ore and then all of a sudden you see
[513.90 - 517.98] the canary die in the cage that means
[516.00 - 520.08] you've got very little time but you've
[517.98 - 522.60] got to get out of that cave out of that
[520.08 - 525.06] mine shaft

[534.24 - 537.78] system and that's what happens people
[535.92 - 539.22] don't realize it breaks down the immune
[537.78 - 541.98] system all this stuff
[539.22 - 544.80] Aquarius on IG I was diagnosed with
[541.98 - 546.96] asthma in my 20s but it was really the
[544.80 - 551.48] perfume I was spraying on myself daily
[546.96 - 551.48] it was making me choke breathing it in
[553.08 - 559.08] may I just add this
[556.32 - 560.58] people have no idea how toxic the stuff
[559.08 - 562.14] really is out there in the world and
[560.58 - 563.04] they don't know how serious it is out in
[562.14 - 566.18] the world and I'm going to tell you
[563.04 - 566.18] right now that
[567.12 - 571.20] there's all these people in the health
[569.16 - 575.22] movement right now okay there's all

[579.72 - 583.74] doing their YouTubes maybe they're an
[581.88 - 586.56] influencer

[610.92 - 617.46] industry that creates these deadly
[614.04 - 619.56] chemicals and puts them into our lives
[617.46 - 621.12] and they support it

[642.18 - 646.56] their perfume cologne their air
[644.22 - 648.72] fresheners their detergents with all the

[839.58 - 845.70] person who lived in it 100 200 years ago
[842.52 - 848.52] was using it would be all those scents
[845.70 - 850.62] and all those fragrances it won't be any
[848.52 - 852.66] natural smells like the natural wood
[850.62 - 855.24] smell in the house or the natural
[852.66 - 857.76] whatever house you know would house that
[855.24 - 859.02] natural smell on the Furnitures and
[857.76 - 861.12] everything else it would just be
[859.02 - 863.16] chemicals chemicals chemicals so we live
[861.12 - 865.38] in a world now and the hospitals are
[863.16 - 867.00] filled with chemicals too and that's a
[865.38 - 869.22] scary thing for a lot of people that are
[867.00 - 871.62] sick they're sick and they end up going
[869.22 - 873.54] to the hospital because they they
[871.62 - 875.82] something happened and they fell or some
[873.54 - 877.38] got hurt they went to the hospital to
[875.82 - 878.94] get an x-ray and they're breathing in
[877.38 - 881.40] every single chemical in the book so
[878.94 - 885.44] it's like chemical fragrances have
[881.40 - 885.44] gotten into every single orifice
[886.38 - 892.04] common fragrance exposures aerosol can
[890.16 - 895.32] air fresheners which are big too
[892.04 - 900.20] including squeezy bottles spray bottle
[895.32 - 900.20] air fresheners and Mists it's like
[904.98 - 911.22] oh this was only made in a chemical
[907.56 - 912.84] Factory somewhere synthesized made from
[911.22 - 915.18] a whole bunch of toxic chemicals where
[912.84 - 917.40] if you were dipped in it you would maybe
[915.18 - 922.02] not make it
[917.40 - 924.24] if it was filled into a massive vat and
[922.02 - 925.44] you were dipped in and had to bathe in
[924.24 - 927.90] it
[925.44 - 929.40] God only knows what would happen but
[927.90 - 930.90] it's okay to spray it around everywhere
[929.40 - 932.34] and spray it in the air and spray it on
[930.90 - 934.44] your furniture and spray all that stuff
[932.34 - 935.76] right
[934.44 - 937.62] so we talked about the plug-in air
[935.76 - 939.84] fresheners plug-in air fresheners are
[937.62 - 941.82] tricky one that stuff puffing out it
[939.84 - 945.12] Puffs out and puffs out and then it
[941.82 - 948.38] clings to everything clings to the walls
[945.12 - 951.84] clings to every countertop every
[948.38 - 954.60] clothing item clings to all your shirts
[951.84 - 957.12] clings to your jackets gets into every
[954.60 - 961.04] part of the house
[957.12 - 961.04] Finds Its way into your car
[961.92 - 966.12] all right and I talked about the set of
[964.32 - 967.68] candles too everybody's lighting the
[966.12 - 970.26] scented candles who's crazy you know
[967.68 - 972.42] when the whole the whole sea lockdown
[970.26 - 974.52] happened right no one was on the streets
[972.42 - 976.56] everybody was home
[974.52 - 978.06] no one was out right there was the
[976.56 - 979.26] lockdowns were going down you guys know
[978.06 - 980.58] what I'm talking about a few years ago
[979.26 - 982.98] all that
[980.58 - 984.24] and then what happened well I'll tell
[982.98 - 987.60] you what happened
[984.24 - 990.60] a billion people bought scented candles
[987.60 - 993.00] and they were all just shrines in their
[990.60 - 996.48] rooms and in their houses it was all
[993.00 - 999.12] over every single you know app every
[996.48 - 1000.98] single platform out there everybody was
[999.12 - 1003.38] just scented candles just lighting them
[1000.98 - 1006.02] constantly it was like
[1003.38 - 1008.02] the scented candle chemical
[1006.02 - 1011.24] industry
[1008.02 - 1012.74] exploded when C happened and the
[1011.24 - 1016.58] lockdowns happened
[1012.74 - 1018.86] it was like a boom like no other
[1016.58 - 1020.84] so it fed the chemical industry to
[1018.86 - 1024.02] produce more and more
[1020.84 - 1026.78] deadly chemicals
[1024.02 - 1028.52] and that was the result everybody was
[1026.78 - 1030.26] bored out of their minds
[1028.52 - 1031.76] everybody was sitting in the room and
[1030.26 - 1033.08] they had their you know Facebook running

[1036.74 - 1043.28] get-togethers

[1043.28 - 1050.56] billions going into the chemical
[1045.20 - 1050.56] industry to create more chemicals
[1050.60 - 1054.08] but yet everybody's so like health

[1300.26 - 1304.16] yeah
[1301.88 - 1306.68] people are so loaded with rotting
[1304.16 - 1309.50] protein and putrefying fats inside their
[1306.68 - 1311.72] guts it's pouring through their cells
[1309.50 - 1313.58] it's coming out of their lymphatic
[1311.72 - 1315.74] vessels it's stuck in their liver
[1313.58 - 1318.38] they're they're so filled with rotting
[1315.74 - 1321.92] stuff inside of them that they smell
[1318.38 - 1324.80] like ammonia so what happens is
[1321.92 - 1327.46] to hide that stink from them being so
[1324.80 - 1331.40] toxic it's like
[1327.46 - 1333.62] I smell like [ __ ] so bad it's pouring
[1331.40 - 1335.78] out of me and people know I stink and

[1335.78 - 1341.26] use this deadly chemical crap and I'm
[1338.90 - 1341.26] just gonna
[1341.90 - 1348.38] hide the fact that I stink so bad
[1345.98 - 1351.26] but let me tell you I'd rather smell
[1348.38 - 1353.54] somebody's rotting putrifying [ __ ]
[1351.26 - 1355.52] that's coming out of them because
[1353.54 - 1357.56] they're highly toxic their liver is
[1355.52 - 1358.94] overburdened it's coming through their
[1357.56 - 1361.76] skin
[1358.94 - 1365.30] their their bodies thinks their pants
[1361.76 - 1367.88] stinks I would rather be around someone
[1365.30 - 1370.88] that smells like that at least I know
[1367.88 - 1372.92] that that stuff isn't gonna kill me it's
[1370.88 - 1375.98] not going to actually get into my
[1372.92 - 1378.38] bloodstream and do some damage it's not
[1375.98 - 1380.42] like cologne and perfume I'd rather
[1378.38 - 1382.76] smell what people smell like I'd rather
[1380.42 - 1385.12] know what they smell like I'd be like
[1382.76 - 1387.74] yeah you got a good smell to you man
[1385.12 - 1391.34] dude you've got a lot of rotting protein
[1387.74 - 1393.50] in you did you just fart again yeah it's
[1391.34 - 1395.90] definitely pretty bad you got a good
[1393.50 - 1397.22] smell to you man I'd rather have that
[1395.90 - 1399.14] than
[1397.22 - 1402.50] go up to some of the oh my God that
[1399.14 - 1406.40] cologne is killing me it's killing me
[1402.50 - 1409.34] another thing too Central Oils stink too
[1406.40 - 1411.98] and they trigger migraines too
[1409.34 - 1414.92] I don't care how authentically natural
[1411.98 - 1418.34] or the quality of essential oil they
[1414.92 - 1420.02] trigger people all the time they trigger
[1418.34 - 1422.48] their lungs their nervous system they
[1420.02 - 1423.98] trigger their sinuses they trigger their
[1422.48 - 1426.92] migraines
[1423.98 - 1428.60] and then they float around and saturated
[1426.92 - 1430.94] to the walls if everybody's doing
[1428.60 - 1433.70] essential oils non-stop they saturate
[1430.94 - 1435.86] the walls and saturate the furniture and
[1433.70 - 1437.78] eventually create a mold problem I
[1435.86 - 1440.80] talked about this on Rumble this episode
[1437.78 - 1440.80] on Rumble with that
[1441.80 - 1445.16] I'm not saying you can't use essential
[1443.42 - 1446.60] oils I'm just saying that there's a lot
[1445.16 - 1448.34] to understand about all this stuff
[1446.60 - 1449.72] another thing too is you'll find that
[1448.34 - 1451.42] they're taking essential oils and
[1449.72 - 1454.70] they're putting it in toxic project
[1451.42 - 1457.82] products so it might be like oh our
[1454.70 - 1460.16] detergent has essential oil of orange in
[1457.82 - 1462.50] it our detergent has essential oil of
[1460.16 - 1466.58] lemon in it meanwhile it also has
[1462.50 - 1468.86] perfume perfume perfume and fragrance in
[1466.58 - 1470.60] there that's not the essential oil so
[1468.86 - 1472.22] then you're tripped so there's all these
[1470.60 - 1473.66] products now that have essential oils in
[1472.22 - 1475.88] it that you think are natural with
[1473.66 - 1477.56] essential oil but they're not there's
[1475.88 - 1481.24] fragrances in there perfumes and
[1477.56 - 1481.24] perfumes in there it's all in there
[1482.60 - 1487.04] Health with Hennis is essential oils

[1487.04 - 1490.16] really a good one
[1488.48 - 1491.84] good information
[1490.16 - 1493.46] if you don't want your house to always
[1491.84 - 1496.84] smell like those essential oils forever
[1493.46 - 1496.84] don't ease them
[1497.84 - 1501.10] because someone was saying that
[1501.40 - 1505.76] this isn't an essential oil attack I'm
[1504.38 - 1508.10] talking about the chemical industry I'm
[1505.76 - 1509.90] talking about fragrances and perfumes
[1508.10 - 1512.12] perfumes colognes and all the different
[1509.90 - 1514.28] fragrances and right the detergents the
[1512.12 - 1517.16] fabric softeners and even more than that
[1514.28 - 1519.56] right that the household cleaners with
[1517.16 - 1521.66] all the fragrance in it oh my God walk
[1519.56 - 1523.40] down the grocery store and I talked
[1521.66 - 1526.46] about the other day walk by the the
[1523.40 - 1529.34] toiletries the toiletries
[1526.46 - 1531.98] every time I have to walk down through
[1529.34 - 1535.40] that aisle for some reason
[1531.98 - 1537.56] with family or some whatever or friend
[1535.40 - 1540.26] and I gotta walk down that aisle of
[1537.56 - 1545.50] toiletries I'm just like toiletry hell
[1540.26 - 1545.50] it's it's it's so highly toxic
[1549.68 - 1553.82] you know like I'm thinking this right
[1552.02 - 1555.74] right that I don't like the smell or
[1553.82 - 1559.72] something and everybody loves the smell
[1555.74 - 1559.72] but I don't think you guys like it right
[1560.78 - 1568.34] IG comment right here Sarah Valentine
[1565.58 - 1570.08] yes some high
[1568.34 - 1572.00] so let's see some high-end Japanese
[1570.08 - 1574.88] restaurants do it
[1572.00 - 1579.44] and send an email reminder fragrance
[1574.88 - 1582.62] interferes the dining experience whoa
[1579.44 - 1584.12] it kills the smell of food you won't
[1582.62 - 1586.22] smell the food that was really good
[1584.12 - 1587.18] point you won't smell the food in a
[1586.22 - 1589.34] restaurant
[1587.18 - 1590.24] you will smell cologne in perfume in a
[1589.34 - 1592.88] restaurant
[1590.24 - 1595.52] and air fresheners too and chemical
[1592.88 - 1596.54] cleaners that the restaurant uses on the
[1595.52 - 1599.18] tables
[1596.54 - 1601.04] not going to smell the food really it
[1599.18 - 1602.96] just gets into the hypoglossal nerve it
[1601.04 - 1605.66] gets into the nerves and the cranial
[1602.96 - 1607.76] nerves it gets into all of them
[1605.66 - 1609.44] but clear nerve it just gets into all
[1607.76 - 1611.36] the different cranial nerves and it just
[1609.44 - 1613.52] starts to beat it down those fragrances
[1611.36 - 1615.62] the chemicals
[1613.52 - 1617.54] beats it down all right

[1939.62 - 1943.52] just want to bother I'm just an innocent
[1942.02 - 1947.06] little person that just put a bug and
[1943.52 - 1950.68] pig what's the smell chemical companies
[1947.06 - 1950.68] chemical factories
[1952.24 - 1957.50] the fragrance sector of the chemical
[1954.62 - 1959.30] industry is far from innocent far from
[1957.50 - 1962.36] innocent man
[1959.30 - 1963.86] rap bastards the industry has a set of
[1962.36 - 1966.56] goals
[1963.86 - 1969.20] one goal is to keep their chemicals in
[1966.56 - 1971.24] mass production
[1969.20 - 1973.52] to do this they want to keep people
[1971.24 - 1975.44] purchasing their chemicals so let's keep
[1973.52 - 1977.24] on purchasing those scented candles and
[1975.44 - 1979.04] all those air fresheners let's keep on
[1977.24 - 1980.78] purchasing all that perfume cologne and
[1979.04 - 1983.96] every other thing in body lotion that
[1980.78 - 1986.12] scented sure let's feed the industry all
[1983.96 - 1988.64] the money they ever wanted they can
[1986.12 - 1991.22] produce more chemicals
[1988.64 - 1993.50] and kill the environment so every bird
[1991.22 - 1996.14] never knows what the natural air ever
[1993.50 - 1999.92] smells like again no one cares about
[1996.14 - 2001.78] what a bird smells nobody cares about a
[1999.92 - 2003.82] hawk and the fact that the hawk has to
[2001.78 - 2007.60] breathe in every single dryer vent
[2003.82 - 2009.58] spewing out of every single house
[2007.60 - 2012.64] when nobody cares
[2009.58 - 2014.50] of course not why should we right to do
[2012.64 - 2016.42] this they want to keep people purchasing
[2014.50 - 2018.22] their chemicals and to do that they want
[2016.42 - 2020.56] to condition and train people they want
[2018.22 - 2022.42] to brainwash them to believe they need
[2020.56 - 2026.82] these synthetic fragrances and scents
[2022.42 - 2026.82] you need that synthetic fragrance
[2026.86 - 2029.76] and what about the
[2030.82 - 2036.72] what about our pets inside the house
[2033.22 - 2036.72] breathing in all of that
[2039.70 - 2044.68] last but not you know or their pets that
[2043.00 - 2047.14] are outside breathing all of that in
[2044.68 - 2049.00] outside what about children breathing
[2047.14 - 2050.38] all that in
[2049.00 - 2052.18] I mean we don't want our children
[2050.38 - 2054.16] breathing in all that chemical from
[2052.18 - 2055.60] chemical industries does that make any
[2054.16 - 2056.98] sense
[2055.60 - 2058.54] it's about learning the truth and
[2056.98 - 2061.78] getting empowered
[2058.54 - 2063.76] because you just don't want the stuff to
[2061.78 - 2066.96] keep on getting stronger out there and
[2063.76 - 2066.96] growing and taking over the planet
[2067.18 - 2073.26] if you know about it
[2069.40 - 2073.26] it at least helps you because
[2074.14 - 2079.42] it's going to affect us either way
[2077.32 - 2081.40] just because look it doesn't make it go
[2079.42 - 2082.60] away if you don't know about it if
[2081.40 - 2083.92] you're somebody that doesn't want to
[2082.60 - 2085.48] know about it and you want to just be
[2083.92 - 2087.34] ignorant to it and you don't want to you
[2085.48 - 2090.64] want to put a blind eye to it
[2087.34 - 2092.44] it doesn't go away it's there it's
[2090.64 - 2096.00] tormenting a lot of people and a lot of
[2092.44 - 2096.00] animals and a lot of Wildlife
[2099.16 - 2102.52] they want to condition and train people
[2100.78 - 2105.04] to believe they need these synthetic
[2102.52 - 2108.34] fragrances and scents last but not least
[2105.04 - 2110.68] they want to take away any future chance
[2108.34 - 2113.32] for someone to know what nature really
[2110.68 - 2117.04] smells like did you hear that
[2113.32 - 2118.98] did you guys hear that get ready last
[2117.04 - 2122.14] but not least the chemical industry
[2118.98 - 2124.54] wants to take away any future chance for
[2122.14 - 2126.64] someone to know what nature really
[2124.54 - 2129.64] smells like your children's children
[2126.64 - 2131.74] will not know what nature smells like
[2129.64 - 2134.94] on planet Earth down the road these
[2131.74 - 2134.94] chemicals have taken over
[2135.64 - 2139.00] I can promise you your children's
[2137.44 - 2140.62] children won't know what this planet
[2139.00 - 2142.60] smells like
[2140.62 - 2144.52] Spirit of compassion has told me that
[2142.60 - 2146.86] it's not my guess
[2144.52 - 2148.36] Spirit of compassion has told me our
[2146.86 - 2150.28] children's children are never going to
[2148.36 - 2151.90] know what nature smells like again
[2150.28 - 2154.06] on this planet
[2151.90 - 2156.52] Kendall McCargo says knowing the truth
[2154.06 - 2158.08] helps make an informed decision that can
[2156.52 - 2159.70] change your life and help prevent
[2158.08 - 2161.80] further damage
[2159.70 - 2165.46] way better said than me
[2161.80 - 2169.36] it's better said than what I would say
[2165.46 - 2172.06] whether smelling Ocean Air at the beach
[2169.36 - 2173.14] smelling the Earth and fresh air of the
[2172.06 - 2176.74] forest
[2173.14 - 2177.76] or smelling flowers and freshly moaned
[2176.74 - 2180.76] grass
[2177.76 - 2182.20] As the Wind rustles Through trees in
[2180.76 - 2184.90] your backyard
[2182.20 - 2187.24] they want to destroy and disrupt the
[2184.90 - 2188.68] authentic experience and they will
[2187.24 - 2190.48] destroy and disrupt it for your
[2188.68 - 2192.40] children's children
[2190.48 - 2196.74] Jenny Jenn said my neighbor's cat smells
[2192.40 - 2196.74] like drier sheets from lying on her bed
[2198.94 - 2203.80] my friend invited me on a
[2201.94 - 2206.34] little boating
[2203.80 - 2206.34] trip
[2206.44 - 2209.82] was like a really small boat
[2210.34 - 2215.50] we went out
[2211.96 - 2218.44] he said let's smell some fresh air
[2215.50 - 2220.18] all I could smell the entire time on
[2218.44 - 2222.58] this little boat
[2220.18 - 2226.90] was all the scented [ __ ]
[2222.58 - 2230.16] that was trapped on my friend's body
[2226.90 - 2230.16] and in his clothes
[2230.80 - 2235.86] including the chemicals he used to clean
[2233.26 - 2237.76] his little boat
[2235.86 - 2241.72] including
[2237.76 - 2244.42] the bug repellent he sprayed
[2241.72 - 2246.46] just a can of bug repellent in the
[2244.42 - 2249.34] corner of the boat made it so you
[2246.46 - 2254.56] couldn't smell a darn thing
[2249.34 - 2257.68] it was the worst wasted outing I've had
[2254.56 - 2260.92] I could not smell the water I could not
[2257.68 - 2263.20] smell the air I could not see the clouds
[2260.92 - 2264.82] and have a vision of smelling like
[2263.20 - 2268.54] something good while you're looking at
[2264.82 - 2272.44] the clouds roll by all you smelt was
[2268.54 - 2274.54] just chemical chemical chemical
[2272.44 - 2276.78] and all I did was complain the whole
[2274.54 - 2276.78] time
[2277.00 - 2281.56] gen Z said Can enough people not wake up
[2279.58 - 2283.96] and make a change for the future or it's
[2281.56 - 2285.46] hopeless it's a tricky one because when
[2283.96 - 2287.62] you see people who are supposed to be
[2285.46 - 2288.82] health-minded all over social media apps
[2287.62 - 2291.28] everywhere
[2288.82 - 2292.72] who are influencers and they're supposed
[2291.28 - 2294.76] to be health-minded and they say they're
[2292.72 - 2296.26] health-minded and they're doing all
[2294.76 - 2299.26] these healthy things with their foods
[2296.26 - 2301.62] and no processed foods and they're
[2299.26 - 2305.32] choosing vegan leather you know shoes
[2301.62 - 2306.10] slippers and heels and sneakers or
[2305.32 - 2308.74] whatever
[2306.10 - 2310.60] and they're not doing it and they're
[2308.74 - 2312.76] totally addicted to their sense and
[2310.60 - 2314.74] their their perfumes colognes and all
[2312.76 - 2317.38] the conventional sprays and air freshers
[2314.74 - 2319.98] I don't think there's hope I try to
[2317.38 - 2319.98] spread the word
[2320.80 - 2325.60] you know so that people stop buying the
[2323.74 - 2327.46] products and educate other people out
[2325.60 - 2328.90] there they stop buying all the scented
[2327.46 - 2331.62] fragrances and all the different
[2328.90 - 2331.62] products and everything
[2332.74 - 2338.50] here is IG comment aw you're the only
[2335.62 - 2341.50] person that ever described multiple
[2338.50 - 2344.08] chemicals sorry
[2341.50 - 2345.76] hey W you're the only person that has
[2344.08 - 2348.40] ever described multiple chemical
[2345.76 - 2350.68] sensitivity exactly as it is I cried
[2348.40 - 2354.12] when I read your chapter on it thank you
[2350.68 - 2354.12] thank you for being here
[2355.90 - 2360.40] we're
[2357.36 - 2363.88] Amanda says how do we stop it question
[2360.40 - 2365.86] mark times 10 question marks
[2363.88 - 2368.38] we're trying to stop it
[2365.86 - 2370.90] I put it in the medical medium books I
[2368.38 - 2373.78] talk about it wherever I can
[2370.90 - 2376.00] you know I'm trying to actually stop it
[2373.78 - 2378.10] the key is enough people have to
[2376.00 - 2380.38] complain out there in the world and stop
[2378.10 - 2382.18] buying the products that are scented so
[2380.38 - 2384.04] that the chemical industry sees a
[2382.18 - 2386.56] reduction
[2384.04 - 2390.10] of their investment into it like they
[2386.56 - 2394.00] see a reduction of sales so they start
[2390.10 - 2396.46] to slowly push them out you know of the
[2394.00 - 2398.26] market
[2396.46 - 2399.94] we're coming to a time when we're not
[2398.26 - 2402.82] going to know what any of these natural
[2399.94 - 2404.92] surroundings smell like we're only going
[2402.82 - 2406.54] to be surrounded by contaminating
[2404.92 - 2409.72] fragrances
[2406.54 - 2414.52] you walk into Whole Foods now
[2409.72 - 2416.08] all you smell is everybody's stuff you
[2414.52 - 2417.94] think everybody's shopping in Whole
[2416.08 - 2422.26] Foods
[2417.94 - 2426.40] is health-minded or natural or plant
[2422.26 - 2428.88] or sorry Planet saving mind
[2426.40 - 2431.56] of planet-saving mind
[2428.88 - 2435.04] and health
[2431.56 - 2436.42] mindset right you walk in there the
[2435.04 - 2439.48] stink
[2436.42 - 2442.18] of everybody's sense coming off of them
[2439.48 - 2443.50] and blowing off them air fresheners on
[2442.18 - 2445.78] their clothes
[2443.50 - 2448.24] send the candles all over whatever
[2445.78 - 2452.62] everything you name it it's just one big
[2448.24 - 2455.02] cologne bath you go into any place now
[2452.62 - 2457.74] fragrances are unlike other toxic
[2455.02 - 2457.74] chemicals
[2457.84 - 2463.24] many toxic chemicals have a shelf life
[2460.24 - 2466.18] and dissipate over time
[2463.24 - 2469.18] the rain can dilute certain outdoor
[2466.18 - 2471.64] toxic chemicals for example thin them
[2469.18 - 2474.22] out and make them less harmful the rain
[2471.64 - 2477.40] cannot thin out a toxic chemical
[2474.22 - 2481.66] that's saturated with fragrance
[2477.40 - 2484.78] the rain cannot even thin out
[2481.66 - 2490.00] God's nature
[2484.78 - 2490.00] the Earthly mother's nature rain
[2491.32 - 2495.52] a substance
[2493.06 - 2498.06] created from our Earthly mother cannot
[2495.52 - 2498.06] fit out
[2498.34 - 2503.68] saturated fragrances
[2500.92 - 2507.04] fragrances are being created to last for
[2503.68 - 2510.58] an eternity
[2507.04 - 2512.68] extremely long time and not dissipate
[2510.58 - 2514.06] in many cases fragrance can be
[2512.68 - 2516.76] unstoppable
[2514.06 - 2520.66] Unstoppable
[2516.76 - 2522.88] I'm dramatic today we're on the verge of
[2520.66 - 2525.04] never being able to smell what The Ocean
[2522.88 - 2526.84] Air is like when we're standing on the
[2525.04 - 2528.70] beach because we're just going to be
[2526.84 - 2529.72] smelling fragrances blowing off of
[2528.70 - 2532.36] people
[2529.72 - 2535.30] I'm dramatic for a reason because that
[2532.36 - 2537.40] right there all of this is so sad it
[2535.30 - 2539.92] breaks my heart so I'm really passionate
[2537.40 - 2542.26] about you know talking about it because
[2539.92 - 2544.66] it's it's just terrible
[2542.26 - 2546.88] Jamie the best thing that ever happened
[2544.66 - 2550.12] to me is working from home all the
[2546.88 - 2551.92] smells in the office killed me
[2550.12 - 2553.84] it's terrible
[2551.92 - 2554.98] I'm happy you're working at home it
[2553.84 - 2557.58] makes me happy
[2554.98 - 2557.58] for you
[2559.30 - 2565.12] fragrances are unidentified chemicals
[2562.12 - 2567.82] even more so than other domestic
[2565.12 - 2569.38] chemical industry Invader products
[2567.82 - 2571.66] which you'll read about in the next few
[2569.38 - 2573.82] pages one loophole in the chemical
[2571.66 - 2575.80] industry is this fragrances don't have
[2573.82 - 2576.76] to list the multiple chemicals within
[2575.80 - 2581.22] them
[2576.76 - 2581.22] all they have to list is fragrance
[2581.62 - 2586.68] 100 deadly chemicals in there just
[2583.60 - 2586.68] listed fragrance
[2587.98 - 2591.94] when you see the word fragrance in a
[2589.96 - 2594.72] list of ingredients you're looking at
[2591.94 - 2594.72] corruption
[2596.62 - 2601.42] because in that word are a host of
[2598.84 - 2606.04] different chemicals that will not be
[2601.42 - 2608.38] listed as ingredients in that product
[2606.04 - 2611.56] using a product that lists natural
[2608.38 - 2613.42] fragrance is not a way out
[2611.56 - 2617.52] there are still chemical industry
[2613.42 - 2617.52] fragrances in natural fragrances
[2618.58 - 2622.60] the chemical industry is allowed to call
[2620.38 - 2624.88] a fragrance natural
[2622.60 - 2626.56] if there's one single essential oil
[2624.88 - 2629.86] added to the mix of the industrial
[2626.56 - 2631.96] chemicals that's why my makeup
[2629.86 - 2635.86] or that's why my body wash and my body
[2631.96 - 2638.02] lotion is so great it says essential oil
[2635.86 - 2639.58] oh I'm not really looking at that other
[2638.02 - 2641.08] word in there on the bottle that's
[2639.58 - 2645.18] fragrance
[2641.08 - 2645.18] but it says essential oil natural
[2645.60 - 2650.32] if there's one single essential oil
[2648.16 - 2652.36] added to the mix of industrial chemicals
[2650.32 - 2654.72] they can tag their fragrance as being
[2652.36 - 2654.72] natural
[2655.54 - 2661.96] what an evil Escape
[2658.78 - 2664.66] whether scented products seem
[2661.96 - 2668.26] conventional or natural what you'll find
[2664.66 - 2670.48] listed in them are fragrance
[2668.26 - 2672.28] or natural fragrance
[2670.48 - 2675.40] or perfume
[2672.28 - 2677.32] or perfume
[2675.40 - 2679.48] you will not see the list of chemicals
[2677.32 - 2681.46] in the fragrance or perfume so you'll
[2679.48 - 2684.28] miss out on any understanding of how
[2681.46 - 2687.34] many industrial created chemicals
[2684.28 - 2690.28] go into making that scent even if it
[2687.34 - 2692.74] says naturally derived it still doesn't
[2690.28 - 2695.08] mean it gets a free pass
[2692.74 - 2697.78] there's a comment on IG
[2695.08 - 2699.94] I save so much money now anything with
[2697.78 - 2703.42] perfumes perfume or natural fragrances
[2699.94 - 2706.18] is left on the Shelf boom
[2703.42 - 2707.80] boom
[2706.18 - 2709.78] amazing
[2707.80 - 2713.74] many people in the health scene are
[2709.78 - 2716.56] concerned about conventional products oh
[2713.74 - 2718.18] this is pretty cool
[2716.56 - 2720.34] many people in the health scene are
[2718.18 - 2723.70] concerned about conventional products
[2720.34 - 2726.40] so they're using clean makeup
[2723.70 - 2728.26] clean hair care products
[2726.40 - 2730.48] Clean Skin products
[2728.26 - 2733.06] meanwhile these products all have either
[2730.48 - 2737.14] fragrances or natural fragrances or
[2733.06 - 2740.26] perfume in them or any combination
[2737.14 - 2742.60] if you were to sit inside a chemical
[2740.26 - 2744.46] Factory watching people with hazmat
[2742.60 - 2748.48] suits did you hear that
[2744.46 - 2750.94] did you hear that hazmat suits
[2748.48 - 2752.92] walking around giant containers of
[2750.94 - 2754.84] swirling chemicals
[2752.92 - 2756.94] and then you saw those chemicals being
[2754.84 - 2759.10] put into a fragrance and that fragrance
[2756.94 - 2761.44] sold to all the different companies that
[2759.10 - 2763.42] sell all these products
[2761.44 - 2764.80] with your clean makeup and your skincare
[2763.42 - 2766.48] and your body washes and your body
[2764.80 - 2769.66] lotions
[2766.48 - 2771.82] you would be shocked
[2769.66 - 2773.86] off your butt
[2771.82 - 2776.80] it didn't say that it said you will be
[2773.86 - 2779.56] shocked to say the least
[2776.80 - 2781.54] I said shocked off your butt Spirit
[2779.56 - 2784.08] compassion said you would be shocked to
[2781.54 - 2784.08] say the least
[2784.84 - 2788.62] sabotaged self-care let's read a little
[2787.18 - 2791.20] bit about this real quick
[2788.62 - 2794.26] we're adopting healthier Lifestyles we
[2791.20 - 2796.54] are adopting healthier lifestyles
[2794.26 - 2798.28] or eating healthier foods yes we are
[2796.54 - 2800.10] eating healthier foods out there in the
[2798.28 - 2803.94] world you see it everywhere everybody
[2800.10 - 2803.94] top five foods
[2805.72 - 2809.20] we're concerned about our environment
[2807.52 - 2812.32] yes we are concerned about our
[2809.20 - 2814.72] environment everybody is
[2812.32 - 2816.88] and at the same time we're allowing
[2814.72 - 2819.28] perfumes colognes and fragrances to be
[2816.88 - 2823.08] inside everything many people are
[2819.28 - 2823.08] concerned about climate change
[2823.18 - 2826.72] and at the same time they're
[2824.74 - 2829.18] contaminating our climate with chemical
[2826.72 - 2832.68] industry soups that are highly toxic and
[2829.18 - 2835.54] even affect wildlife
[2832.68 - 2838.20] one reason we turn to fragrances is
[2835.54 - 2838.20] self-care
[2838.48 - 2843.04] we're picking out perfumes and scented
[2840.58 - 2845.02] candles and scented lotions and scented
[2843.04 - 2848.38] everything because they're supposed to
[2845.02 - 2851.28] relax us make us relax and put us in the
[2848.38 - 2851.28] right frame of mind
[2851.80 - 2856.66] we think we're promoting well-being by
[2854.08 - 2858.64] using fragrances another reason we use
[2856.66 - 2861.46] so much fragrance is that our bodies
[2858.64 - 2864.10] have smells and fragrance is how we hide
[2861.46 - 2866.74] our stink
[2864.10 - 2869.74] it means all these fragrance chemicals
[2866.74 - 2871.90] are inside our brain we're allowing
[2869.74 - 2875.20] chemical Giants to hurt our brain age
[2871.90 - 2877.54] our skin and body age our lungs and age
[2875.20 - 2882.42] our organs speed up the disease process
[2877.54 - 2882.42] and at the same time age our pets
[2883.12 - 2887.62] fragrances are in air freshener scented
[2885.76 - 2890.32] candles makeup including clean makeup
[2887.62 - 2891.82] skin care Hair Care body care products
[2890.32 - 2894.22] weather clean or regular and
[2891.82 - 2896.98] conventional laundry products the more
[2894.22 - 2898.78] organic or clean we go with our domestic
[2896.98 - 2901.48] products for body care and more the more
[2898.78 - 2903.72] loopholes the chemical Giants find to
[2901.48 - 2907.48] put their fragrances with unidentified
[2903.72 - 2909.04] toxic chemicals into these products
[2907.48 - 2911.88] what I'm trying to say is the more
[2909.04 - 2911.88] loopholes
[2913.54 - 2919.68] the more products we have the more
[2915.94 - 2919.68] loopholes the chemical industry uses
[2920.92 - 2923.10] foreign
[2923.28 - 2927.46] we go with our domestic products for
[2925.72 - 2929.08] body care and more the more loopholes
[2927.46 - 2931.12] the chemical Giants find to put their
[2929.08 - 2933.22] fragrances with unidentified toxic
[2931.12 - 2935.38] chemicals into these products it's
[2933.22 - 2939.36] imperative we get wise to it and avoid
[2935.38 - 2939.36] fragrances including perfumes
[2940.36 - 2943.92] so you want to read this last little
[2941.44 - 2943.92] part here
[2945.76 - 2951.64] so
[2947.76 - 2953.08] uh end maker says so what do we buy 10
[2951.64 - 2955.36] question marks
[2953.08 - 2958.00] I do try to put better options on the
[2955.36 - 2960.66] medicalmedium.com directory for those
[2958.00 - 2960.66] who are asking
[2964.42 - 2968.98] forced exposure
[2966.46 - 2971.32] we all need to get wise to the ways the
[2968.98 - 2973.30] chemical industry tries to expose us to
[2971.32 - 2976.06] these fragrances even when we don't
[2973.30 - 2978.88] personally use them
[2976.06 - 2981.34] for example scented candles and plug-in
[2978.88 - 2984.70] air fresheners saturate walls even if
[2981.34 - 2986.38] the person using them moves out anyone
[2984.70 - 2988.72] who moves into the home or office
[2986.38 - 2991.06] afterward has to contend with the
[2988.72 - 2994.72] lingering scent
[2991.06 - 2996.94] fragrances can become mold harboring a
[2994.72 - 2998.68] film begins to develop from burning
[2996.94 - 3001.08] scented candles or using plug-in air
[2998.68 - 3003.12] fresheners and that film collects on
[3001.08 - 3005.10] every Fabric and fixture inside the home
[3003.12 - 3006.78] trapping particles of dust and debris
[3005.10 - 3009.36] that flow into the air
[3006.78 - 3012.74] I'm in brain saver I'm on page 212 right
[3009.36 - 3012.74] here can I show you guys
[3018.00 - 3021.48] trapped in the film this debris can
[3020.04 - 3024.60] Harbor moisture creating a perfect
[3021.48 - 3027.06] situation for mold to grow someone often
[3024.60 - 3029.22] uses fragrance in the first place to
[3027.06 - 3031.14] cover the smell of mold or mildew in a
[3029.22 - 3033.48] space in a situation like this where
[3031.14 - 3035.40] mold is already present adding fragrance
[3033.48 - 3038.94] products such as air fresheners or
[3035.40 - 3041.10] scented candles can accelerate the mold
[3038.94 - 3043.86] fulfillment centers
[3041.10 - 3047.16] Manila says Anthony help I'm so
[3043.86 - 3050.60] sensitive to all perfumes perfumes when
[3047.16 - 3050.60] I go outside my house
[3050.88 - 3057.20] my health is in in horror or my house is
[3054.48 - 3057.20] in the horror
[3060.24 - 3063.44] check this out you guys
[3064.08 - 3066.84] it breaks my heart first to begin with
[3065.82 - 3068.82] okay
[3066.84 - 3070.08] that anybody's hypersensitive and they
[3068.82 - 3071.70] got the chemical sensitivities and they
[3070.08 - 3074.16] have to deal with all this stuff
[3071.70 - 3076.26] that's awful fulfillment centers and
[3074.16 - 3078.48] warehouses are shipping out products
[3076.26 - 3080.88] such as clothing that are saturated with
[3078.48 - 3082.62] air fresheners contaminating the
[3080.88 - 3084.84] products that arrive at our homes and
[3082.62 - 3087.24] workplaces so you know what's happening
[3084.84 - 3089.34] is the clothing the Fashion World the
[3087.24 - 3092.88] clothing companies
[3089.34 - 3095.42] it's being saturated because the work
[3092.88 - 3095.42] houses
[3095.76 - 3099.72] in some of these situations with
[3097.20 - 3104.22] clothing right
[3099.72 - 3106.02] are filled with air freshener and the
[3104.22 - 3110.18] Fulfillment centers
[3106.02 - 3110.18] all of it filled with air fresheners
[3110.46 - 3115.56] drier dust is extremely toxic when any
[3113.16 - 3117.48] fragrances are used in the home which
[3115.56 - 3119.28] means that neighbors get exposed this
[3117.48 - 3121.44] dryer exhaust is a combination of the
[3119.28 - 3124.20] air fresheners in the home plus perfumes
[3121.44 - 3126.06] cologne scented candles Cosmetics body
[3124.20 - 3128.22] products saturating all the clothes
[3126.06 - 3130.98] being laundered
[3128.22 - 3132.84] combined with the fragrances of the
[3130.98 - 3136.20] laundry detergents and fabric softeners
[3132.84 - 3140.00] used all blowing hot air
[3136.20 - 3140.00] in polluting the environment
[3140.88 - 3145.92] guys let's make the shot let's just talk
[3143.64 - 3148.02] about the shot for a second
[3145.92 - 3149.70] this is the toxic fragrance exposure
[3148.02 - 3151.86] shot we're doing right now here's here's
[3149.70 - 3155.04] a comment on IG great information
[3151.86 - 3156.90] Vincent says if we don't know
[3155.04 - 3160.80] we can't change it
[3156.90 - 3162.78] I love smelling the refreshing when I go
[3160.80 - 3165.06] out in the bush
[3162.78 - 3167.22] cool so when you go outside and you're
[3165.06 - 3169.44] out there in the fields
[3167.22 - 3172.02] out in the bush many people call it
[3169.44 - 3174.72] you're out on the water you're in the
[3172.02 - 3177.36] woods you love the smell
[3174.72 - 3179.70] frana says sometimes I thought something
[3177.36 - 3181.68] was wrong with me because I can't stand
[3179.70 - 3183.42] perfume or deodorant it's like we're
[3181.68 - 3186.36] we're
[3183.42 - 3187.98] if you have a problem with it you're the
[3186.36 - 3190.08] problem
[3187.98 - 3192.30] that's how they try to do it
[3190.08 - 3194.52] oh you can't handle it
[3192.30 - 3196.02] you just you don't like the perfume
[3194.52 - 3197.16] cologne and air fresheners and scent of
[3196.02 - 3199.02] candles and everything else and
[3197.16 - 3200.40] detergents and all that stuff you don't
[3199.02 - 3202.98] like all the deadly chemical stuff
[3200.40 - 3204.12] created in chemical factories oh you're
[3202.98 - 3206.58] the problem

[3208.68 - 3213.30] way I want too bad that's your problem
[3211.44 - 3215.94] is this what the world does
[3213.30 - 3218.22] sassy at my old place of employment a
[3215.94 - 3219.84] woman wore a super strong perfume that
[3218.22 - 3221.58] triggers my migraines
[3219.84 - 3224.22] it would linger for hours through
[3221.58 - 3227.06] hallways Etc I had to get
[3224.22 - 3227.06] out of the building
[3229.08 - 3232.26] it's like you can linger in your sinuses
[3230.88 - 3234.42] for days
[3232.26 - 3236.10] and then in your bloodstream when my
[3234.42 - 3239.04] neighbor left his house
[3236.10 - 3241.74] his perfume is so strong it goes through
[3239.04 - 3243.98] my door inside my apartment it makes me
[3241.74 - 3243.98] sick
[3246.90 - 3250.92] that's another thing too it's like
[3249.36 - 3252.96] people think they're making themselves

[3469.16 - 3474.66] let's do it
[3471.36 - 3476.28] I got my shot glass right here
[3474.66 - 3480.90] I got
[3476.28 - 3482.82] my containers I got the mm-1500
[3480.90 - 3484.38] which a friend told me that he's
[3482.82 - 3486.42] actually saving money
[3484.38 - 3488.94] he got he didn't believe me with the MN
[3486.42 - 3490.08] 1500 it's purchased every single juicer
[3488.94 - 3492.06] out there
[3490.08 - 3494.10] and I said no you got to believe me on
[3492.06 - 3495.36] the mm-1500 like
[3494.10 - 3496.56] he goes well I'm only going to believe
[3495.36 - 3497.82] you because you're always right about
[3496.56 - 3500.46] stuff
[3497.82 - 3501.96] and you're always straight out with me
[3500.46 - 3504.60] that's what he said so I said okay we'll
[3501.96 - 3506.46] get the 1500 got the 1500
[3504.60 - 3507.54] and he said but he said I just didn't
[3506.46 - 3510.18] think I could save that much money
[3507.54 - 3512.88] that's what he said I thought I'd save a
[3510.18 - 3514.74] little but not a lot so then he was
[3512.88 - 3516.42] keeping tabs on exactly how much produce
[3514.74 - 3519.24] he was buying to run through the juicer
[3516.42 - 3521.82] and then he he weighed that against what
[3519.24 - 3524.16] his other juicer was and everything and
[3521.82 - 3525.78] he said it was insane it was like it was
[3524.16 - 3527.58] like hundreds he's saving a week and
[3525.78 - 3530.10] he's allowed to juice now
[3527.58 - 3532.76] because of the food costs going up

[3846.60 - 3850.76] all through my body from these shots
[3852.66 - 3856.38] is it because of the synergistically
[3854.34 - 3858.90] combined ribbon ingredients in the
[3856.38 - 3861.30] phytochemical compounds involved then no
[3858.90 - 3863.34] one would know work together to actually
[3861.30 - 3865.20] battle or up against and that's what
[3863.34 - 3866.90] these things are
[3865.20 - 3872.94] from Spirit combustion

[3948.06 - 3952.56] minutes apart from any other food or
[3950.40 - 3955.44] drink it doesn't mean you might not have

[3955.44 - 3959.40] morning when you drink you know lemon
[3956.94 - 3961.92] water but you you should have 15 to 30
