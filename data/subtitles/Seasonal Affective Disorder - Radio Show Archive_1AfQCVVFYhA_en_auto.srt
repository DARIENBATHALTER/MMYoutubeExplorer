18
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,399
depressed or anxiety ridden throughout

19
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:50,760
the

energy and they just there feel listless

23
00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:01,480
and no motivation and when fall comes

24
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:03,640
around and we go into winter and you

25
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:05,720
just don't want to function and aches

26
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:08,600
and pains and all this other stuff that

27
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:10,799
comes along with it there is some

28
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:12,280
serious things going on with this whole

29
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,799
thing and people suffer and they

30
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:17,560
struggle and and they fight through this

31
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:19,680
and you know fighting to survive

32
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:22,759
fighting to get through the day fighting

33
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:25,759
to just push through and persevere you

34
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:28,640
know when that sad comes popping around

35
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:31,280
and but it's it's much more than this

36
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,079
it's much more than that so you know if

37
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,680
I sound kind of sarcastic and I got that

38
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:38,479
little funny laugh going on that's

39
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:43,360
because what's out there as far as

40
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:44,880
information on sad is ridiculous it's

41
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:48,119
hilariously

42
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,479
utterly you know you know silly I mean I

43
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:53,200
don't even know I can't even find words

44
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:54,960
it's really because it's that bad so you

45
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,719
know they're like oh okay wait a minute

46
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,520
you know maybe um you know when fall

47
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:01,039
late fall comes in Winter and you're

48
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:05,360
getting the these different symptoms

49
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:07,799
that's Sab it's a real thing I'm glad at

50
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:11,000
least the medical communities I'm glad

51
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:14,319
at least the World Views it as something

52
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,879
thank God we're there but that's not

53
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:20,280
where it stops and that's not what it's

54
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:22,319
all about it's much bigger than that and

55
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,360

102
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,400
was telling me the other day and they

103
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,599
were saying well you know what's

104
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,680
interesting about your Instagram and

105
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:20,120
everything else you're not plastered

106
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,040
everywhere and it's kind of funny

107
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:24,000
because

108
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:27,400
someone someone else said I didn't even

109
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,240
know you existed if you were real and

110
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:31,960
until until recently a little snip bit

111
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,880
of a video that popped up with you

115
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:44,720

116
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:47,080
seen before and the reason why I'm not

117
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,000

Heard a Voice perfectly clear that

148
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,479
grandmother of lung cancer I've used

and and and and more so that's a little

152
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:08,560
bit about me so let's go into sad that's

153
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,800
what we're that's what we're waiting for

154
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,400
that's what we're here for today so

155
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,280
Seasonal effective

156
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:18,160
disorder um here's the thing about this

157
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,479
this sad that's so important to

158
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:24,120
understand

159
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:28,000
sad is really just a red flag it's a

160
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:30,800
sign it's a sign something else is going

161
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,360
on that's what it is is see what we do

162
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,520
in the medical communities today um both

163
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,440
conventional and even some alternative I

164
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,039
I I mean I will say that and look I love

165
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,960
both sides I love conventional I love

166
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:43,720
alternative medicine of course and

167
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:46,160
everything in between and you name it

168
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:49,080
but here's What's Happening Here is we

169
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:52,720
we don't know what's causing

170
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:54,919
something so we give it a label and a

171
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:58,199
tag that's what we do give it a label in

172
00:06:54,919 --> 00:07:00,160
a tag like sad and we say well it's

173
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:02,280
obviously happening for people in the

174
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,599
winter so it must be the seasonal thing

175
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:07,120
they start feeling better in the spring

176
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:09,879
and summer so it must be that's what it

177
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:12,160
must be but that's where it stops it

178
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:13,599
stops right there and then if we get a

179
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,160
little smarter we're like well maybe

180
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:18,039
they need Vitamin D maybe they need

181
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:21,400
Vitamin D from the Sun maybe they need

182
00:07:18,039 --> 00:07:25,160
supplementation of vitamin D and it kind

183
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:26,599
of stops there and that's pretty much it

184
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,400
and you know I mean sure we could go a

185
00:07:26,599 --> 00:07:30,080
little farther and say well maybe you

186
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:33,240
know they're lacking some other things

187
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:35,720
and so forth but it's it's way bigger

188
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:38,400
it's way bigger than that so I want to

189
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:39,840
start with the fact that sad developed

190
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,800
where you know a lot of people were

191
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,159
experiencing these strange symptoms

192
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:46,800
during the winter and they felt better

193
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:49,440
in the summer and the strange symptoms

194
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:52,159
were you know the you the sadness the

195
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:54,840
the loneliness the depression a little

196
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:57,120
bit of anxiety some nervousness right a

197
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:58,840
whole bit and that's kind of you know

198
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:03,080
that kind of caught on over the years

199
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:05,919
and became sad but there's just as many

200
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:09,240
people experiencing that in the spring

201
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:12,759
and summer too so they experience it in

202
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:14,440
the spring or summer and it's also kind

203
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:15,560
of random some people experience it in

204
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,319
the spring and summer some people

205
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,879
experience it in the winter some people

206
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:21,720
experience it in the fall some people

207
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:25,840
it's only in the spring it's really a

208
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:27,520
hot mess what I mean a hot mess is it's

209
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,479
it's not even labeled right it's not

210
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:32,320
tagged right there's nothing going on

211
00:08:29,479 --> 00:08:33,880
with as far as the advancement of it it

212
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,440
it it that's why I was saying earlier

213
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:38,240
how ridiculous the whole thing is first

214
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:40,240
of all there are real problems people

215
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:43,120
are suffering with and dealing with

216
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:45,399
there are real issues sad is real in a

217
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,000
sense where you're not feeling good

218
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:49,880
that's as real as it gets you're not

219
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,680
feeling good and because there's just as

220
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:55,000
many people getting it in the summer and

221
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:57,640
then maybe they only get it one year out

222
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
of three years does that mean it's sad

223
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:02,040
and there's people that okay they get it

224
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,760
every every winter but then there's

225
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:07,800
different levels and

226
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:10,600
severities now here's where we go wrong

227
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:13,800
if it gets too severe it's not sad

228
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:17,760
anymore come on so if it gets too severe

229
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:21,440
it's not sad so if it's just mild it's

230
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:23,160
sad you know what I'm saying you are you

231
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:26,240
are you you know you're you're following

232
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:29,200
me with this because so if it's more

233
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:31,279
severe so the ache and pain is not just

234
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,720
kind of feeling like oh listless and a

235
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:36,600
little low energy and a little kind of

236
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:38,680
achy it's you know I got bad aches and

237
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,000
pains I got problems now all of a sudden

238
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:42,680
it's not

239
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,800
sad but but the little

240
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:46,640
achiness and the little you know the

241
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:50,040
little symptoms of low energy versus

242
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:54,320
severe fatigue and heavy achiness is

243
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:56,800
just basically the beginning or a milder

244
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:59,120
version of something else that's

245
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:01,480
happening but instead of like coming

246
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,760
coming to that conclusion or or or

247
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:07,800
coming to the to the you know to

248
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:10,079
realization and revelational I idea of

249
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,839
understanding that hey you're dealing

250
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:13,560
with low-grade something you're dealing

251
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:17,279
with mild

252
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:19,399
versions mild versions of something

253
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:23,320
that's bigger and in some people it gets

254
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:25,120
worse and a lot of people it gets worse

255
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:27,880
and I me there's people that have sad

256
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,600
every year for 10 years where they come

257
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:31,800
into the fall

258
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:35,600
they come into the winter the fall of

259
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:37,920
the winter and they're they're they're

260
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,480
feeling you know depressed they're

261
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,279
feeling achy and tired they're feeling

262
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,639
the low energy they're feeling

263
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:46,079
completely disconnected you know and

264
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:47,399
they have this and then it Sparks up and

265
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,519
they're feeling better in the spring and

266
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:50,440
summer and it goes on like that for

267
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:54,680
eight or 10 years and then one winter is

268
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:57,839
exceptionally bad all of a sudden severe

269
00:10:54,680 --> 00:11:01,839
fatigue aches and pains that are crazy

270
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:03,519
um real serious severe depression um all

271
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:06,880
kinds of symptoms tingles and numbness

272
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:08,120
everything else with it and then finally

273
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,240
it's like now they're not what they're

274
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:12,839
not in the sad category anymore what

275
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:15,360
they were experiencing for eight years

276
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:19,440
before it got really bad or a bad year

277
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:22,440
hit was the mild versions of problems

278
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:25,920
real problems real

279
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:28,720
situations like forget this whole sad

280
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,519
thing what the hell I mean we're talking

281
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,560
like

282
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:34,320
that's what I'm trying to tell you is if

283
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:37,000
you're not feeling good in the

284
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,519
winter okay that means that because it's

285
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,760
winter because it's winter because it's

286
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:44,680
fall and yes the sun isn't there and all

287
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:47,839
these things that do support our health

288
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:50,480
and it's freezing freezing but cold and

289
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:52,760
it's just oh my God you know wind

290
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:56,680
blowing and snow piled up there and a

291
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:59,560
lack of light yes those are all things

292
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:02,480
that don't support us as much so if we

293
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:06,639
have something happening underneath it

294
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:08,519
it could worsen if someone has some ra

295
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,760
or a little bit of arthritic thing going

296
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:13,079
on or arthritic thing it's going to get

297
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:15,600
worse if someone has some btis

298
00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:17,240
inflammation of a shoulder or something

299
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,720
which could be from a viral thing like

300
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:23,399
shingles or something yes it could get

301
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:27,120
worse without those you know the

302
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:30,320
beautiful sun without you know without

303
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:33,760
having snow piled up lack of Light

304
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:36,360
freezing cold temperatures you know dry

305
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:41,199
temperatures being real dry in the house

306
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:44,560
all winter long and yeah your btis could

307
00:12:41,199 --> 00:12:44,560
act up is that

308
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:51,199
sad could you know could you be feeling

309
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,040
you know more tired because you have

310
00:12:51,199 --> 00:12:54,560
adrenal fatigue and and it doesn't help

311
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,959
you're not getting any sun and adrenal

312
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:59,639
fatigue gets a little worse yes is that

313
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:03,720
sad that's insane

314
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:05,560
it's insane to just call it sad I'm

315
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:07,199
sorry and look if you guys somebody's

316
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:10,199
getting mad at me right now saying I got

317
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:12,920
sad that's what's he talking about look

318
00:13:10,199 --> 00:13:14,600
just hang in there hang in there because

319
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:18,440
it's it's about getting you answers for

320
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:22,440
your sad it's about getting you answers

321
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:25,959
and I am not undermining or you know or

322
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:29,160
or making fun of the severity of sad or

323
00:13:25,959 --> 00:13:32,440
sad itself I'm just letting you know

324
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:35,480
that when we get tricked when we get

325
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:39,440
tricked and fool into something it's

326
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:42,360
worse it's worse than than you know so

327
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,399
what that means is anybody with a

328
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:46,279
symptom should be taken completely

329
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,760
serious no matter what and it should

330
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:51,279
never be thrown into sad it should be

331
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:53,120
taken dead serious it should be taken

332
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:55,639
really serious do you know what I'm

333
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:59,000
saying like really

334
00:13:55,639 --> 00:14:01,320
serious no joke that means you got Got

335
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Something Brewing and it's in the middle

336
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:05,759
of the winter it shouldn't be just

337
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,839
thrown into this sad thing it should be

338
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:10,920
like wow what's going on that means that

339
00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:14,120
when conditions aren't perfect in your

340
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:16,040
life so ma'am sir when we should really

341
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:18,920
look at this if conditions aren't

342
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:21,759
perfect in your life you start not

343
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:24,040
feeling good so something's obviously

344
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:28,120
happening we shouldn't just throw some

345
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:29,199
some lame label that puts it in a

346
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,680
category

347
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:36,320
that makes it not

348
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:38,480
serious if you know what I mean I so so

349
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,320
it's like okay you got some fatigue

350
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:43,800
kicking on in the fall and

351
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:45,639
winter and somebody else doesn't so that

352
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:48,600
means you just get affected by fall and

353
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:51,440
winter no your condition is getting

354
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:54,360
affected by fall and winter what's going

355
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:56,560
on inside your body that's already there

356
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:58,839
that's not happening with someone else

357
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:01,120
that's getting affected by Falling

358
00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:03,519
winter not fall and winter is the

359
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:06,079
problem and you're just

360
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:07,800
sensitive it's yeah of course you could

361
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:10,120
be sensitive overall but you got there

362
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:12,399
could be something else happening so

363
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:14,759
look let's talk about the symptoms they

364
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:16,680
can range from feeling kind of sad to

365
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:19,839
severely depressed that mean suicidally

366
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:22,040
depressed is really bad and you know it

367
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:24,279
could be like a little bit of anxiety

368
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:27,399
nervousness to severe anxiousness and

369
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:29,880
severe anxiety it could be feeling a

370
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:32,040
little tired when fall and late fall

371
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:34,639
winter come along to feeling really

372
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:37,920
fatigued where your arms are heavy your

373
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:40,839
legs are heavy if a practitioner or

374
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:43,519
doctor diagnoses someone who has heavy

375
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:46,480
legs and heavy arms and is that fatigued

376
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:49,720
in the winter and they diagnosed it as

377
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:52,720
sad they should be

378
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:56,560
fired they should be fired by the

379
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:58,880
patient okay so because if it's in the

380
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,480
middle of the winter you got you can't

381
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,079
lift up your arms you can't lift you

382
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,959
can't move your legs too good you got

383
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:05,839
severe fatigue that's chronic fatigue

384
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:07,519
syndrome and it's not Lyme disease

385
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,880
that's chronic fatigue syndrome that's

386
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:11,720
Epstein bar virus that is literally an

387
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:14,560
Epstein bar coming on heavy in the

388
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:17,199
middle of the winter and you know so

389
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,880
it's and look you know hey could be

390
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:20,959
other things too meaning like someone

391
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:23,079
has you know more getting more problems

392
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:25,000
in the middle of the winter they could

393
00:16:23,079 --> 00:16:27,440
have something else too that's Brewing

394
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,319
no matter what so that you know the

395
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:32,839
symptoms can range from

396
00:16:29,319 --> 00:16:35,440
feeling kind of achy to severe arthritis

397
00:16:32,839 --> 00:16:37,519
to feeling really arthritic or constant

398
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,680
you know a little bit of aches and pains

399
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:42,240
to severe aches and pains if you're

400
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:44,800
dealing with some aches and pains and

401
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,199
you and they come on in the winter and

402
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,759
your doctor kind of doesn't know what

403
00:16:46,199 --> 00:16:50,839
they are and and blames that on sad it's

404
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:52,959
because they don't have an answer to

405
00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:56,000
something else that's subtly there or

406
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:58,680
missing on tests or the labs and so it's

407
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,319
better just say you got sad sad needs to

408
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:04,600
be just kicked out just kicked out gone

409
00:17:01,319 --> 00:17:06,919
someday and instead you got some

410
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:08,799
depression you probably got something

411
00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:10,520
else like let's figure out how many

412
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:12,679
heavy metals you have in your brain

413
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:16,559
that's causing your depression you know

414
00:17:12,679 --> 00:17:18,240
let's figure out how toxic your liver is

415
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:20,039
you know your liver struggling then if

416
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,079
you have depression you know cuz it's

417
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:23,559
probably got a lot of toxins if you got

418
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:25,720
severe exes and pains then it's

419
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:27,679
obviously there's a virus there's a

420
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:29,280
viral issue do you have the shingles in

421
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,880
the system do you have an Epstein bar do

422
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,880
you have cyto magler virus do you have

423
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,039
something else what happens is if if

424
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,080
you're not you know if you're you know

425
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:39,440
if you're you're stayed away from

426
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:41,880
getting sick and you just get a little

427
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,919
extra tired or lonely not lonely but a

428
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:45,679
little lost feeling or tired or feeling

429
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:50,120
a little bit unmotivated when winter

430
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:53,120
comes along and you know there just just

431
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:55,919
little tiny signs that maybe 10 years

432
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:57,640
from now it could be even more and so

433
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:00,280
let's nip it in the butt let's clean

434
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:02,520
things up let's get things better and

435
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:04,159
stronger in your health so that your sad

436
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:06,799
isn't worsen because you know in all the

437
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:09,760
years the decades I've been doing this

438
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:11,799
and helping people I've seen people have

439
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:14,480
you know symptoms of sad tell me they've

440
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:17,960
had symptoms of sad for you know for for

441
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:20,480
a long time okay for a good 10 years and

442
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:23,320
then it seemed to get worse and then it

443
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,039
was then it was called finally something

444
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,799
else from a you a really good

445
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:29,640
practitioner or something said you know

446
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:31,720
what you got something else going on on

447
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:33,159
and and what was really happening and

448
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:35,280
I've had people tell me too what was

449
00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:37,039
really happening Anthony said for 10

450
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:40,720
years I was just getting a little tiny

451
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:44,880
symptoms of that I thought it was

452
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:46,120
sad yeah and and and so we need to take

453
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,559
it

454
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:50,400
seriously if you're feeling depressed

455
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:51,600
when that winter comes along and okay if

456
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,760
you're feeling depressed when summer

457
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:57,120
comes along you know we just have to

458
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:59,080
know what's going on are you detoxing

459
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:02,400
you know it's funny because when we hit

460
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:04,600
Spring our bodies detox themselves our

461
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,840
liers start to detox and if there's

462
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:08,520
enough poison and garbage and viral

463
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:11,159
byproduct and heavy metals and

464
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:14,440
pesticides and Plastics sitting inside

465
00:19:11,159 --> 00:19:16,559
your liver and prescription drugs maybe

466
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:18,320
antibiotics from you know from 30 years

467
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:21,360
ago in your life and it's all sitting

468
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:23,559
inside your liver and that Springtime

469
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,760
comes on your liver is going to be like

470
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:27,280
giving it a kick like kick kick it's

471
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,039
going to start trying to you know it's

472
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,039
going to try to start pushing some of

473
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:34,400
that out of there pushing some of that

474
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:36,440
out of your liver so and that stuff that

475
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:39,240
stuff hits the bloodstream when it hits

476
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:41,280
the bloodstream look out and that could

477
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:42,960
be the onset of Boom um you know the

478
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,440
whole Seasonal effective disorder for

479
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:49,080
the spring and summer because that once

480
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:51,720
that neurotoxin and the byproduct and

481
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:54,080
pesticide byproduct and Plastics and you

482
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:56,280
know whatever it is and you know um all

483
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:59,039
of that radio you know Isotopes all that

484
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:01,600
stuff that gets trapped in livers

485
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:04,679
whatever it could be it gets in there

486
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:06,600
when that starts kicking out then you

487
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:08,440
know you can get you know onset of some

488
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:10,679
depression you get onset of some anxiety

489
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:12,919
can get onset of something and boom you

490
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:16,039
get diagnosed with Asad for

491
00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:17,400
summer and you know it's ignored of

492
00:20:16,039 --> 00:20:20,679
what's really

493
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:23,559
happening and in the fall you know our

494
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:26,640
body does another systematic change in

495
00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:29,400
the fall you know our spleens tend to

496
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:31,919
detox in the fall and spleens get filled

497
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:33,840
up with all kinds of stuff spleens get

498
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:36,440
really heavy they're like they become

499
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:38,400
like little footballs and they get heavy

500
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:41,000
and they do a little kick out in the

501
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,640
fall too you know and the liver does its

502
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,200
little kick out sometimes in the fall

503
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,600
people are different not in everybody

504
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,960
but it can kick out in the fall and

505
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,320
spring what I'm saying is you know

506
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:52,200
there's a lot of different reasons there

507
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:54,280
another thing too is late fall is when

508
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:56,520
sad you know comes on with with the

509
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:57,799
majority of people it's late fall so and

510
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:01,520
probably the majority of the people it's

511
00:20:57,799 --> 00:21:05,200
late fall fall and that's when the you

512
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:06,600
know foods change in people's diets and

513
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,280
they put a lot of you know I mean you

514
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,200
got the Thanksgiving thing so you're

515
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:12,360
doing all the Thanksgiving holiday food

516
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:14,080
then right after Thanksgiving you got

517
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:16,240
the whole Black Friday thing then after

518
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,799
that you got whatever you got Christmas

519
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,679
and the holidays and you're at work and

520
00:21:17,799 --> 00:21:20,919
you're eating cookies and then you're

521
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,159
you know over your aunt's house and

522
00:21:20,919 --> 00:21:24,120
you're eating cookies and then you're

523
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:25,799
over here and you're doing this and yeah

524
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:28,360
it may not seem like it's a lot but it

525
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:30,760
adds up and you might have a drink or

526
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:33,640
two or just something else or an eggnog

527
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:36,360
or whatever it is and you know you've

528
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:38,320
already probably most people I mean most

529
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:40,640
people you know who are not really

530
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:43,279
health-minded probably already not

531
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,880
eating that great anyway summer and fall

532
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:46,279
but they're probably exercising a little

533
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,600
more they're a little bit more active so

534
00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:50,520
they're keeping the poisons at Bay and

535
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:52,919
then come late fall they get a little

536
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:54,919
bit more sluggish because they're not as

537
00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:57,000
active they're not get you know making

538
00:21:54,919 --> 00:21:58,279
time to go walk in the park and then

539
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,240
they're eating a little bit more more

540
00:21:58,279 --> 00:22:02,919
then the liver starts getting clogged up

541
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:04,960
the bloodstream starts getting thick

542
00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:08,000
like oil and grease gets in the

543
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:11,279
bloodstream and you know o less oxygen

544
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,080
to the brain and then you start getting

545
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:15,200
symptoms whether you're starting to get

546
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:16,640
a little bit of viral symptoms or

547
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,919
something else you start getting

548
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:22,720
symptoms and then it's blamed on sad

549
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:27,200
instead of everything else that's really

550
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:29,760
happening so look I could support the

551
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:32,279
the um diagnosis of nsad kind of

552
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:35,440
diagnosis and I can I can you know but I

553
00:22:32,279 --> 00:22:38,240
know I could support it if it helps you

554
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:41,400
to think it's sad I support it but what

555
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:44,120
I'm trying to say is sad is a name for

556
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:45,960
we don't know what's wrong with you we

557
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:48,200
don't know why you start feeling weird

558
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:50,039
in the spring and summer we don't know

559
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,679
why you start yeah that's the the people

560
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:53,000
who actually get the as sad in the

561
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:56,000
spring and summer we don't know why

562
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:59,120
you're feeling weird for going into fall

563
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,919
and winter and we don't have have a clue

564
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:05,200
that's what the label means the label

565
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:07,640
means maybe it's the seasons because

566
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:11,120
it's winter time and you're Fe not

567
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:13,480
feeling so good and that's what it means

568
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:16,480
so let's just be let's just have it on

569
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:19,520
the table and be straight up on it

570
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,840
straight honest about it because if I'm

571
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,360
honest about it and we're straight up

572
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:25,440
about it and it's just on the table

573
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:28,440
right then you know then then you get

574
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:31,440
better you get better you know can't it

575
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:33,720
can't be you know you can't get snowed

576
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,279
on this stuff so when the snow starts

577
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:38,200
falling and you're getting diagnosed

578
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:40,720
with sad you can't get snowed as well on

579
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:43,120
that angle okay so we got to get we

580
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:45,600
can't get tricked it's important so what

581
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:49,360
do we do about this how do we handle it

582
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:50,480
what do we do first of all realize

583
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,919
that's you're a little bit more

584
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:56,640
sensitive because something else is

585
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:59,200
brewing inside so the change of season

586
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,919
and the lack of things that we need like

587
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,360
so going into lead fall we're not

588
00:24:00,919 --> 00:24:03,880
exercising as much we're not taking

589
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:06,600
walks in the air we're not doing all

590
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:10,200
kinds of things you know the cold damp

591
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:12,880
air outside and then the dry heat air

592
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:14,840
inside the house you know like here's an

593
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:17,520
example which is with people who have

594
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:19,440
sinus stuff that goes on their sinuses

595
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:21,600
start getting worse when they're trapped

596
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:24,880
in the house and it's you know you got

597
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:28,679
the heat the dry heat or the forced air

598
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:32,600
in it's winter sinuses get so bad

599
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:34,080
I've seen diagnosis of of sad for people

600
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,200
who their sinus problems start coming on

601
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,760
in the winter and they say well it's got

602
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,520
to be sad because it's coming on in the

603
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:42,720
winter and it seems to only do that then

604
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:44,279
and meaning what's really happening is

605
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:47,120
they have other things going on in their

606
00:24:44,279 --> 00:24:48,960
sinuses mean not so bad but something's

607
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:51,480
happening in there so that when

608
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:53,760
conditions aren't perfect it acts up

609
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:54,960
it's not sad there's just it's acting up

610
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,360
cuz something's going in there maybe

611
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,679
they got a little bit of of strap maybe

612
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,600
they got some some scar tissue in their

613
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:02,679
sinus from years ago from a sinus

614
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:04,919
infection from 30 years ago whatever it

615
00:25:02,679 --> 00:25:09,320
is there's something else

616
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:11,799
happening so what I like to do with with

617
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:14,640
the whole thing if someone says hey I'm

618
00:25:11,799 --> 00:25:16,559
an sad sufferer I got sad like I'd say

619
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:19,360
what I do is say look let's try some

620
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:20,840
things let's get a little zinc in you

621
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:23,159
let's get a little extra zinc to

622
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:24,679
strengthen your immune system because

623
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:27,799
your aches and

624
00:25:24,679 --> 00:25:29,880
pains okay we can call it sad fine we

625
00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:32,520
can call it we can call it anything we

626
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:35,960
can call it you know you know D we can

627
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:38,320
call it D we can call it you know re

628
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:40,600
whatever we want to call it you know

629
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:42,120
let's let's let's just get some more

630
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:44,840
zinc in your system let's build that

631

immune system up let's get it stronger

632
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:51,399
and zinc is critical for sad sufferers

633
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:54,360
critical like one of the biggest ones

634
00:25:51,399 --> 00:25:56,799
and you know I like the liquid sync sulf

635
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:58,120
sulfate um I have that listed on my

636
00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:00,440
website if you want want to know which

637
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:02,080
one's the right one and stuff because

638
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:03,720
you got to get one that doesn't have

639
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,200
preservatives you have to get a zinc

640
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:07,360
that doesn't there's some zinc out there

641
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:09,399
that are like poison when they hit your

642
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:11,240
mouth you know um I might have told you

643
00:26:09,399 --> 00:26:13,120
this before but I've tried so many

644
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:14,600
different supplements myself with Spirit

645
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,840
meaning asking Spirit then I would you

646
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,399
know would get the supplements I would

647
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,840
ask spirit I would try them I would test

648
00:26:17,399 --> 00:26:22,080
them all these different things and the

649
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:25,559
zincs that are out there they're they

650
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:28,720
have so much citric acid in them and

651
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:30,840
that literally it burns your mouth mouth

652
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,960
in such a way that it's unbelievable so

653
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:35,240
just be careful about like those kinds

654
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:37,799
of zincs get the one that you know I

655
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:41,240
recommend or one like it identically

656
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:43,799
like it then you're good um if you like

657
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:45,480
zinc capsules like Z zinc panate from a

658
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:49,080
really reputable company like the ones

659
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:51,200
that I list then then you do that um

660
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:55,080
that could work too but I would you know

661
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:57,720
the liquid one's always best B12 is like

662
00:26:55,080 --> 00:27:00,600
one of the godsends one of the most

663
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:03,000
beautiful God sense of you know that we

664
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:05,279
have on this planet is B12

665
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:08,520
supplementation the right kind for

666
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:10,880
knocking out sad so what is the B12

667
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:13,559
doing what's it doing how can it you

668
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:16,039
know get sad better you know like I

669
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:17,880
found it to get it better well it's not

670
00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:19,480
because you know someone's just dealing

671
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:21,640
with the Seasonal effective disorder and

672
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:24,480
the B12 you know is fixing their

673
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:26,120
Seasonal effective disorder it it's not

674
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,919
that it's because something else is

675
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:31,039
happening like a lot of s when you're

676
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:32,960
dealing with depression and the Mel Mel

677
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:36,799
colly thing the feeling lonely feeling

678
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:38,679
lost feeling you know like like hopeless

679
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:40,080
feeling that feelings of hopeless and it

680
00:27:38,679 --> 00:27:42,080
gets worse in the

681
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:44,760
winter that's

682
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:49,200
neurological see that's neurological if

683
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:50,960
you look at most sad symptoms okay if

684
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,000
you want to pop on or something one of

685
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:55,840
the websites what you want to look up

686
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,159
the sad symptoms they don't say

687
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:01,039
neurological of course not because

688
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:02,080
they're trying to pin these they're not

689
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:04,000
because they don't want you thinking

690
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:06,120
it's neurological they don't want you

691
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,440
thinking your depression is neurological

692
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:10,720
depression is neurological no matter how

693
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:12,480
you slice the cake how you slice the pie

694
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,279
whatever it is it's neurological and if

695
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,600
it's depression that was set off by

696
00:28:14,279 --> 00:28:18,320
losing a loved one it's still your

697
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:21,960
nervous system suffering from the loss

698
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:24,519
of a loved one so even emotionally

699
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:26,720
speaking so something terrible happens

700
00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:28,279
in somebody's life because you know we

701
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,840
all we all face struggles throughout our

702
00:28:28,279 --> 00:28:31,960
life and we all have to we have to wear

703
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:33,559
our armor and we have to be strong

704
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,919
spiritually and emotionally and we have

705
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:36,480
to you know we have to get through our

706
00:28:34,919 --> 00:28:39,240
battles and we have to push through

707
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:41,120
everybody goes through things we all do

708
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:42,640
and when that happens and it hits us

709
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:45,519
hard and it really hits us hard and it

710
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:47,320
breaks our armor down you know and slams

711
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:49,840
us on the ground and we're hurting and

712
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:52,799
we're flapping on the ground you know

713
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:55,399
and um it's it's it's the nervous system

714
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:58,240
that's getting hit we get let down when

715
00:28:55,399 --> 00:29:01,200
we get betrayed we get backstabbed by a

716
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:03,720
partner or a friend or a lover or

717
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:07,399
whoever or a spouse or whatever it is in

718
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:09,600
our lives we get you know backstabbed or

719
00:29:07,399 --> 00:29:12,120
betrayed in some way or some kind of

720
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:15,399
commun communication goes disastrous and

721
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:18,840
breaks down that's hitting us

722
00:29:15,399 --> 00:29:21,039
neurologically it's hitting us our mind

723
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:23,640
it's hitting our mind it's hitting our

724
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:26,000
brain but and then if none of that's

725
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:27,919
going on and there's none of that going

726
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,880
on you don't have any of that there's

727
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:32,039
nothing happening there like there's no

728
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:33,559
big losses and there's no you know

729
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:35,279
there's no betrayal and there's no

730
00:29:33,559 --> 00:29:37,519
heartbreak and there's none of all this

731
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:39,000
stuff and but yet you're feeling that

732
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:40,360
depression and you're feeling that

733
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,640
sadness and you're feeling all these

734
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:47,399
other things it's still neurological

735
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:49,039
it's still central nervous system so if

736
00:29:47,399 --> 00:29:51,360
you look at symptoms and stuff they're

737
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:52,840
not even they don't even go there if you

738
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,799
find something on the Internet this why

739
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:56,240
I always say at the beginning of the

740
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:57,120
show you're going to you're going to

741
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,760
hear about stuff here you're not going

742
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:01,960
to hear anywhere else it just doesn't

743
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:03,640
exist out there and so when you're

744
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:07,120
dealing with the with with all these

745
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:08,919
different feelings including physical

746
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:11,120
feelings like anxiety that's

747
00:30:08,919 --> 00:30:13,320
neurological anxiousness is nervous

748
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:16,200
system okay so it's not just depression

749
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:18,039
it's anxiety's nervous system okay if

750
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:19,519
you're feeling um if you're feeling

751
00:30:18,039 --> 00:30:22,919
aches and pains those are nerves that

752
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:26,039
are hurting aches and pains are nerves

753
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:27,559
you see and you know focus and

754
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:31,000
concentration issues that's a big one

755
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:32,799
with sad guess what focus is

756
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,679
neurological that's

757
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:36,640
neurotransmitters concentration that's

758
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:37,919
neurological that's neurotransmitters

759
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,279
all you need is a good dose of heavy

760
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,559
metals in the brain like we talked about

761
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:43,760
in the heavy metal detox show and you

762
00:30:41,559 --> 00:30:46,440
got focus in concentration problems

763
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:49,360
that's nervous system that's not

764
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:51,080
sad but that's what I mean when you look

765
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:53,039
at all these feeling disconnected that's

766
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:57,600
central nervous system feeling you know

767
00:30:53,039 --> 00:31:00,039
all those feelings and you know when you

768
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:02,399
the only one that's not central nervous

769
00:31:00,039 --> 00:31:04,240
system that really is you know a symptom

770
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:08,240
too like another symptom that we really

771
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:10,559
deal with is weight gain and that's not

772
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:12,120
neurological that's liver that's your

773
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:14,120
liver getting real sluggish in the

774
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:15,720
winter could be the foods that you've

775
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:17,279
eaten anything like that could be the

776
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:19,360
fact that you got a l gr viral thing in

777
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:21,320
the liver could be um you know more

778
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:23,159
pesticides and antibiotics stored up in

779
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:26,279
your liver from years ago could be

780
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:29,600
anything and and then that's what the

781
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:31,399
weight gain you know can happen too um

782
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:33,120
but that's not neurological that one but

783
00:31:31,399 --> 00:31:36,679
most every

784
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:40,000
symptom with sad is central nervous

785
00:31:36,679 --> 00:31:44,360
system it's neurological so for that to

786
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,880
be just taken off the table thrown away

787
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:47,440
that in meaning why that information

788
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:49,720
doesn't exist maybe they didn't Discover

789
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,559
it yet maybe maybe I'm giving them too

790
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:56,720
much credit they just didn't Discover it

791
00:31:51,559 --> 00:31:59,960
yet or something and you know fine but

792
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:02,720
hey you got sad and that's the answer so

793
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:06,840
okay so that's that's what it comes down

794
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:08,679
to so so what can we do to battle it B12

795
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,720
is like for the central nervous system

796
00:32:08,679 --> 00:32:11,559
so that's what I was talking about

797
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:13,279
before before I ran off a little bit on

798
00:32:11,559 --> 00:32:15,000
you guys before I ran off I'm sorry

799
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:17,799
about that

800
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:21,639
B12 is for the central nervous system

801
00:32:17,799 --> 00:32:23,760
sad improves from every aspect of it

802
00:32:21,639 --> 00:32:26,519
from the depression from the anxiety

803
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:27,840
from from the aches and pains from the

804
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:29,960
fatigue

805
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:32,760
and and hey fatigue that's neurological

806
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:34,919
too unless it's just adrenal fatigue but

807
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:36,360
most people who are experiencing more

808
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:38,240
than just adrenal fatigue are

809
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:41,000
experiencing neurological fatigue with

810
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:44,639
the adrenal fatigue so the

811
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:46,440
B12 is is for all of this including

812
00:32:44,639 --> 00:32:48,720
somebody who's got weight gain issues

813
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:52,559
because the liver needs more B12 if it's

814
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:54,519
sluggish so that's a weapon secret

815
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:57,399
weapon so where are we now we're going

816
00:32:54,519 --> 00:32:59,679
into the winter is that what it is so

817
00:32:57,399 --> 00:33:01,720
you know this is such a that's look

818
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:03,399
whether we're going into the summer

819
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:05,440
whether we're going into the spring

820
00:33:03,399 --> 00:33:07,960
whether we're going into the fall it

821
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:11,519
doesn't matter okay it doesn't matter in

822
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:13,279
the end cuz cuz sad originated at first

823
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:15,279
where it was just winter then for some

824
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:18,480
reason it broadened and became exactly

825
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:21,440
more summer but it's really anytime any

826
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:23,279
season overall and look if you're

827
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:25,159
somebody who it's definitely hardcore

828
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:27,519
winter where Winter's when it happens

829
00:33:25,159 --> 00:33:28,799
and I start feeling worse then yeah but

830
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:30,799
everybody feels it different at

831
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:31,880
different months and different times

832
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:34,080
different times of the year different

833
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:36,320
times of the seasons So Different

834
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:39,399
Seasons so it's you know so it's

835
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:42,600
important to do the B12 that's a big one

836
00:33:39,399 --> 00:33:46,279
spirulina I love that one because

837
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:49,760
spirina holds so many powerful nutrients

838
00:33:46,279 --> 00:33:53,799
to support it's not just about vitamin D

839
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:56,000
believe me if if if I literally had two

840
00:33:53,799 --> 00:33:58,519
options like someone someone it say I

841
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:01,760
didn't feel good okay and I knew what

842
00:33:58,519 --> 00:34:05,840
that was Spirit told me whatever or say

843
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:08,440
I didn't say say whatever I mean you

844
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:10,399
know say spirit said both these things

845
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:12,720
say Spirit didn't want to tell me what

846
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:14,839
what what was better for me okay so

847
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:15,919
let's let's just say that because I know

848
00:34:14,839 --> 00:34:17,240
it's hard to say because spirit always

849
00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:18,800
tells me what's better for everybody

850
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:20,320
what's better for me too and all that

851
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:23,159
but say spirit said well you got two

852
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:25,320
options here in front of you or somebody

853
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:27,599
put two options in front of me it was

854
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:29,520
spirulina and vitamin D they said you

855
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:32,560
can only have one option you can only

856
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:35,679
choose one option for you not feeling

857
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:38,800
good and let's just label it

858
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:40,040
sad okay um you're feeling a little this

859
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,919
feeling a little that let's just label

860
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:44,040
it sad I would go with the spirina 100%

861
00:34:42,919 --> 00:34:46,639
go with the

862
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:49,960
spirulina because the spirulina is going

863
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:52,320
to have so many more nutrients for real

864
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:54,520
reasons why you have

865
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:56,320
sad so if you're dealing with a little

866
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:57,720
fatigue you might be experiencing a

867
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,160
little bit of a viral load you might

868
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:01,920
have some heavy metal spirina is good

869
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:03,320
for all those if you have deficiencies

870
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:05,160
let's just pretend sad is just

871
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:07,240
deficiencies well spirulina outweighs

872
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:09,119
vitamin D any day if you're going to

873
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:11,280
take vitamin D take vitamin D3 and I

874
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:15,240
support vitamin D3 I'm just saying

875
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:18,359
spirulina overrides it and so there's

876
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:22,880
things we can do that are just amazing I

877
00:35:18,359 --> 00:35:26,160
like lemon balm for sad cuz lemon balm

878
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:28,359
is is like a nerve tonic it's not only

879
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:30,000
antiv my role in case your sad is low

880
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:32,320
grade Epstein bar low- grade chronic

881
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,440
fatigue low grade shingles low grade

882
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:36,680
some other kind of bug low- grade stpa

883
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:39,000
cacus whatever it is lemon bomb is great

884
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:41,000
because it's an anti- viral

885
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,680
antibacterial it's like an

886
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,480
antibiotic but I would I would you know

887
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:49,079
I would use lemon bomb in a second

888
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:50,839
because lemon bomb is also relaxing to

889
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:52,560
the central nervous system and it's

890
00:35:50,839 --> 00:35:56,880
strengthens the central nervous system

891
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:59,560
and like I said sad really is 95%

892
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:02,640
neurological symptoms that are mild and

893
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:05,480
some severe unless a doctor you know

894
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:07,800
unless you go to 10 15 20 30 doctors and

895
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:09,760
finally some doctor says hey you got

896
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:11,280
something else going this ain't sad you

897
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:13,800
got something you know something's

898
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:15,720
happening here and even if that's the

899
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:17,960
case regardless of whatever lemon bomb

900
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:21,400
is going to be helpful for it so lemon

901
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:25,800
bomb is another secret weapon now out of

902
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:28,240
the foods get foods that have life to

903
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:30,400
them in your diet you're coming into

904
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:32,520
winter chances are you're eating a

905
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,960
little differently in the summertime we

906
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:37,720
might eat a pint of

907
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:41,480
strawberries we might eat a pint of

908
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:44,200
blackberries we might have more apples

909
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:47,640
maybe in the early fall or something or

910
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:50,040
late fall but we get into winter and we

911
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:52,200
forget and don't realize these Foods

912
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:54,400
disappear and these foods help protect

913
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:57,200
us they protect our nervous system they

914
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,720
keep us strong they keep us healthy so

915
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:02,079
if you're someone that's afraid of fruit

916
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:03,680
to begin with and you got sad or you you

917
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:05,680
you believe you have sad or you've been

918
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:07,920
told that whatever we can call it

919
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:09,960
anything I'm totally cool totally happy

920
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:12,560
with that but if you got sads you know

921
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:15,920
happening then you can't keep fruit out

922
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:18,440
of your diet 100% you can't be on a

923
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:21,079
fruitless diet you don't want to be on a

924
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:22,319
fruitless diet I'm not saying stop

925
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:23,599

926
00:37:22,319 --> 00:37:25,079
eat and all the whether it's animal

927
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:26,960
protein or not or whatever it is I'm not

928
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:29,960
saying that you just can't keep fruit

929
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:33,240

know could be the neurological stuff

990
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:57,880
could be the liver being sluggish and

991
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,680
stag stagnant and

992
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:04,160
toxic um you know it could be it could

993
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:06,920
be all of that and it usually is and it

994
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:09,920
really is so that's really important to

995
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:11,359
know um when we're low grade viral when

996
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,599
we when we have these different things

997
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:14,119
going on in with us and we're

998
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:16,200
chronically ill because we got the

999
00:40:14,119 --> 00:40:18,200
low-grade viral thing so say somebody

1000
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:20,119
with Hashimoto thyroiditis you guys know

1001
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:22,599
how how everything I talk about that

1002
00:40:20,119 --> 00:40:24,520
we're Epstein bar causes Hashimoto that

1003
00:40:22,599 --> 00:40:27,520
means the Epstein bar virus is sitting

1004
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:30,720
inside your thyroid when you have hasim

1005
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:33,000
well when winter time comes symptoms of

1006
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:35,079
you know Hashimoto can can amp up

1007
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Hashimoto can get the thyroid can get a

1008
00:40:35,079 --> 00:40:40,960
little bit worse sometimes during the

1009
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:42,599
winter and um because anything you have

1010
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:45,160
whatever that might be whether you're

1011
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:47,880
prone to UTI whether you're whether you

1012
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:51,079
have um you know gastritis intestinal

1013
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:54,800
tract disorders you know IBS they tend

1014
00:40:51,079 --> 00:40:57,880
to worsen anyway under winter

1015
00:40:54,800 --> 00:41:00,000
conditions everything we have regardless

1016
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:02,960
of what it is we walk around in life

1017
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,000
tends to worsen now sometimes when it

1018
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:07,880
worsens in the summer it's also because

1019
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,720
of the bad air in the summer we have um

1020
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:13,000
we have those heat waves that are filled

1021
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:15,920
with extreme amount of toxins we're

1022
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:18,119
talking loads of heavy metals in the sky

1023
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:21,359
during these humidity heat waves that

1024
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:23,560
hit that hit you know um up there in the

1025
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:25,839
north and you name it in the summertime

1026
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:29,640
where it's really humid the humidity is

1027
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:31,720
up but the air quality is down there's

1028
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:34,160
less oxygen in the air it's filled with

1029
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:36,359
tremendous amounts of toxins falling out

1030
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:38,640
of the sky you know radiation you name

1031
00:41:36,359 --> 00:41:40,040
it so we get waves of that in between

1032
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:42,760
when the air gets a little better and

1033
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:46,000
nicer days happen those waves of that

1034
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:47,440
swell people up when when you have

1035
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,520
chronic illness going on if you're

1036
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,880
dealing with a little bit of chronic

1037
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:51,560
fatigue and you got a little bit of

1038
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:53,280
Edema and you got a little bit of flute

1039
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:56,040
retention and that heat wave comes on

1040
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:58,280
with that bad air you might feel it you

1041
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:59,800
might feel like the effect of it and

1042
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:01,040
have to be in the air conditioning and

1043
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:02,680
everything else because if you go

1044
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:04,680
outside you feel it and then that's

1045
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:07,200
blamed on

1046
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:08,480
sad see that's blamed on Seasonal

1047
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:10,720
effective disorder so you go to the

1048
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:13,680
doctor and you're like well in the

1049
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:15,160
summertime I I can't handle the heat I

1050
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:17,880
suffer more that's because something

1051
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:19,119
else is happening and then you know hey

1052
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:20,720
your doctor might say well you just got

1053
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:22,280
Seasonal effective disorder and then you

1054
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:24,119
start feeling depressed you can't go out

1055
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:26,599
enough you can't you know you don't feel

1056
00:42:24,119 --> 00:42:28,280
that great when you're outside and

1057
00:42:26,599 --> 00:42:30,280
there's there it's because of these

1058
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:32,240
different circumstances so when we're

1059
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:34,480
sensitive with all kinds of different

1060
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:36,880
issues whether it's sinuses whether it's

1061
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:38,280
UTI whether it's stomach problems

1062
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,839
whether it's aches and pains whether

1063
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:43,400
it's fatigue whether it's depression

1064
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:45,240
anxiety you name it they tend to worsen

1065
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:48,319
when the winter comes on and for some

1066
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:50,520
people when the summer comes on not for

1067
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:53,720
most people but a lot of people does it

1068
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:57,680
could hit and like I said even in

1069
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:59,760
between at different times too so let's

1070
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:02,599
look at other options to get rid of you

1071
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:04,040
know to get rid of what is called sad

1072
00:43:02,599 --> 00:43:06,000
what is called Seasonal effective

1073
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:07,319
disorder you know to help the mood and

1074
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,760
everything else well you want to you

1075
00:43:07,319 --> 00:43:10,599
want to do the heavy metal detox okay

1076
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:12,280
because if you're dealing with

1077
00:43:10,599 --> 00:43:14,920
depression and you're dealing with

1078
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:17,319
anxiety and you're dealing with um the

1079
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:18,640
mood the mood swings and even if

1080
00:43:17,319 --> 00:43:21,079
someone's giving you a diagnosis a

1081
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:23,000
bipolar which isn't it's another thing

1082
00:43:21,079 --> 00:43:24,920
that they don't know what's wrong that's

1083
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,920
just you know a term for being up or

1084
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:29,920
down that's not a real diagnosis that's

1085
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:31,280
another label and um so if you're

1086
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,720
somebody that's been up and down you're

1087
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:34,920
all over the place and it's hard for you

1088
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:37,359
to focus and concentrate and you're on a

1089
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:39,960
high 1 minute not a low one minute toxic

1090
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:42,000
heavy metals and so you want to get on

1091
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:44,960
that that heavy metal detox that I talk

1092
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,960
about in the recent show um and you can

00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:49,839
go to my blog you can go to my blog and

1094
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:52,720
find the the tox the heavy metal detox

1095
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:55,760
you can go there and find it it's in the

1096
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:57,319
books but the bottom line is you getting

1097
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:59,440
these different things in you so let's

1098
00:43:57,319 --> 00:44:02,760
cover a few more the lemon bomb was

1099
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:07,440
critical that's a big one even golden

1100
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:10,960
seal is good to test out for sad golden

1101
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:12,960
seal is antiviral antibacterial so if

1102
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:14,800
whatever condition you're dealing with

1103
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:16,680
and it's worsening a little come winter

1104
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:19,880
or worsening a little come summer do a

1105
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:22,359
week on golden seal um people their

1106
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:25,079
lives turn around do a week or two on

1107
00:44:22,359 --> 00:44:26,640
golden seal so you know and then always

1108
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:29,400
look for the right one a whole bit like

1109
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:31,480
I said you know you know um we recommend

1110
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:34,119
the stuff that I believe is the safest

1111
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:37,800
and the best and and the body's

1112
00:44:34,119 --> 00:44:40,599
friendliest and so that's one I like too

1113
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:42,680
that's a great one and there's other

1114
00:44:40,599 --> 00:44:44,839
things you can do ibrite ibite is an

1115
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:47,240
herb that is incredible it's an

1116
00:44:44,839 --> 00:44:50,880
antiviral antibacterial but I like

1117
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:53,200
ibrite because ibrite has um it's not

1118
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:55,119
just about being antiviral antibacterial

1119
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:56,480
it it it allows us to clean up our blood

1120
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:58,480
a little bit

1121
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:00,839
um it's kind of like a blood cleanser

1122
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:02,079
same thing with red clover red clover so

1123
00:45:00,839 --> 00:45:04,760
if you go to your health food store or

1124
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:06,559
go online we have some sources too that

1125
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:08,760
we list if you go and check out the

1126
00:45:06,559 --> 00:45:11,240
sources and you get red clover

1127
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:13,480
flowers and you make tea with it every

1128
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:17,040
single day all winter

1129
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:18,440
long it's going to help clean the blood

1130
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:20,400
while you're going through winter it's

1131
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:21,920
going to help keeping your blood clean

1132
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:24,960
it's a great blood

1133
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:26,520
cleanser and so what that does is it's

1134
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:31,480
helping your liver because a lot of

1135
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:33,319
people's sad is liver problems but liver

1136
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:36,240
problems that could set off neurological

1137
00:45:33,319 --> 00:45:38,280
symptoms so the liver could be sluggish

1138
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:40,280
stagnant filled with heavy metals filled

1139
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:42,440
with poisons and then it's it's

1140
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:44,760
releasing into the bloodstream affecting

1141
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:46,680
the central nervous system so you want

1142
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:50,400
to clean up the blood so red clover is a

1143
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:53,119
great one too nettle Leaf is remarkable

1144
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:55,160
for sad it's anti-inflammatory it's

1145
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:57,160
incredible anti-inflammatory what

1146
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:59,240
happens is is our sad is blamed on you

1147
00:45:57,160 --> 00:46:01,160

00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:04,240
saying before aches and pains which is

1149
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:06,760
inflammation of the nerves is blamed on

1150
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:10,440
sad at the doctor's office you go on

1151
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:12,200
nettle leaf and it starts to calm down

1152
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:14,640
those nerves brings down the

1153
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:19,319
inflammation then you're just addressing

1154
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:21,400

downhill towards the end of the day and

1218
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:50,160
it's like cookies in the winter and I

1219
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:52,240

starts getting worse towards the end of

1223
00:48:55,640 --> 00:49:00,599
of the day and you know that's when it

1224
00:48:58,359 --> 00:49:02,480
should be like handful of walnuts

1225
00:49:00,599 --> 00:49:05,960
handful of hemp seeds celery sticks

1226
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:09,760
apple slices um oranges secret weapon

1227
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:12,240
sad is oranges tangerines and oranges

1228
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:14,319

Tangerine juice or orange juice or

1232
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:24,839
sunlight that's in that fruit that

1233
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:26,839
sunlight holds a lot of different

1234
00:49:24,839 --> 00:49:28,799
nutrients meaning it UPS the nutrients

1235
00:49:26,839 --> 00:49:31,000
in the tangerine and the orange it UPS

1236
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:33,799
it the sunlight and that sunlight

1237
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:35,520
physical sunlight that hits the orange

1238
00:49:33,799 --> 00:49:39,400
and you know ripens it orange over time

1239
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:43,760
and makes it that that beautiful color

1240
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:46,480
that powerful medicine develops right

1241
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:48,559

Trace magnesium combined with phenolic

1262
00:50:31,839 --> 00:50:36,000
acids so just know that the mango has

1263
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:38,720
this bioactive Trace magnesium sitting

1264
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:42,520
inside of it with this with these

1265
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:46,640
phenolic acids combined it strongly

1266
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:49,559
supports our nervous system and and just

1267
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:51,559
as I was saying before our sad Seasonal

1268
00:50:49,559 --> 00:50:54,160
effective disorder is central nervous

1269
00:50:51,559 --> 00:50:56,680
system based it most of it literally

1270
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:59,520
almost every part of sad is central

1271
00:50:56,680 --> 00:51:02,079
nervous system based papaya incredible

1272
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:04,480
for sad because by far it's one of the

1273
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:07,400
most powerful gut restoratives and our

1274
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:11,599
guts are tied to our nervous systems so

1275
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:13,520
papayas are that powerful see the papaya

1276
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:17,119
has not only this digestive enzyme thing

1277
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:20,920
going on it's got 500 over 500

1278
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:22,880
undiscovered enzymes in papaya they're

1279
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:25,000
incredible for our guts and our guts are

1280
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:27,359
so wired to the nervous system so think

1281
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:29,799
about bringing in some of these Foods in

1282
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:32,720
any way you can a half a papaya here and

1283
00:51:29,799 --> 00:51:36,119
there maybe you could find a good mango

1284
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:38,160
get a tangerine in there and literally

1285
00:51:36,119 --> 00:51:40,799
this could be lifechanging and will be

1286
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:43,240
lifechanging so do it when you can take

1287
00:51:40,799 --> 00:51:47,280
one day at a time even if you just bring

1288
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:50,040
in one food a day so one food a day one

1289
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:52,359
food every other day you know one food

1290
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:55,559
hey look if all you can do is bring in

1291
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:57,640
one food a week it can help it really

1292
00:51:55,559 --> 00:52:01,599
can't even if it's subtle even if it's

1293
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:04,760
just mildly there you know a little bit

1294
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:08,720
help it matters because your body will

1295
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:10,720
actually use that food it'll use it for

1296
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:12,040
you even if you don't feel the effect

1297
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:13,799
yet but if you can get it every day then

1298
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:14,880
you'll feel the effects faster of course

1299
00:52:13,799 --> 00:52:18,400
because your body's going to be able to

1300
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:20,240
get more of it and that matters and you

1301
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:22,520
know all these things make a difference

1302
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:24,960
to build up you know build up your

1306
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:37,799
diagnosis and also protect you so that

1307
00:52:33,559 --> 00:52:40,400

1308
00:52:37,799 --> 00:52:42,799
and develop into more Depression more

1309
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:44,440
anxiety you know and and all these other

1310
00:52:42,799 --> 00:52:46,760
different symptoms along with it more ex

1311
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:49,200
and pains more fatigue you name it let's

1312
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:52,359
not go there let's let's head it off at

1313
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:53,920
the past Lord knows enough people have

1314
00:52:52,359 --> 00:52:55,760
enough symptoms and they can't even get

1315
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:56,960
out of bed you guys know know I know

1316
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:58,559
many of you are dealing with it and

1317
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:01,440
can't function and you you know it's

1318
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:04,079
enough of that's going on so let's all

1319
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:05,760
work on getting better and moving to the

1320
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:09,040
right direction moving to the right

1321
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:12,880
place with all of this so the bottom

1322
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:16,160
line is realize hey you know let's not

1323
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:19,599
get tricked let's not get fooled about

1324
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:22,400
the labels were handed so much let's get

1325
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:24,760
down to the bottom of what's going on

1326
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:26,280
what's really happening you know what's

1327
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:28,200
the deal

1328
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:29,920
and that's the direction we need to go

1329
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:31,200
that's the key so I would just

1330
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:33,480
incorporate some of these different

1331
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:36,000
supplements bring in some of the foods

1332
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:38,640
without a doubt if you know somebody

1333
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:40,799
going through this you know offer them

1334
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:43,280

1335
00:53:40,799 --> 00:53:45,920
helpful really life-changing and make a

1336
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:47,520
