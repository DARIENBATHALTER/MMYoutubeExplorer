[1.28 - 7.76] How many people do you know who struggle
[4.32 - 10.24] with their health? Chances are, whether
[7.76 - 14.56] they show it or not, most of the people
[10.24 - 17.64] in your life do. And chances are, you're
[14.56 - 20.80] one of them. Whether you're dealing with
[17.64 - 25.04] anxiety, depression, endometriosis,
[20.80 - 28.00] acne, eczema, autoimmune, thyroid, lime,
[25.04 - 31.32] brain fog, fatigue, or any other symptom
[28.00 - 34.48] or condition, you're far from
[31.32 - 37.76] alone. Living with symptoms has become
[34.48 - 41.44] the new normal. So, no more guessing
[37.76 - 43.84] games. It's time to get answers. Welcome
[41.44 - 45.92] to the Medical Medium Podcast. I'm
[43.84 - 48.32] Anthony William.
[45.92 - 51.36] We're talking about the black box, the
[48.32 - 53.52] flight recorder on chemtrail planes and
[51.36 - 56.40] geoengineering planes. How if a
[53.52 - 59.04] chemtrail plane ever goes down somewhere
[56.40 - 61.52] and public authorities get a hold of
[59.04 - 64.24] that crash, they'll be looking for that
[61.52 - 66.64] black box. They'll be looking for that
[64.24 - 69.76] flight recorder. And that's the last
[66.64 - 72.48] thing chemtrail programs, the sinister
[69.76 - 75.12] geoengineering programs want the public
[72.48 - 77.68] authorities to have access to. They
[75.12 - 80.08] don't want the truth going out there.
[77.68 - 82.20] They don't want a device that has all
[80.08 - 84.80] the records and the
[82.20 - 87.36] communications between the chemtrail
[84.80 - 90.56] pilots and other pilots and the
[87.36 - 93.12] chemtrail pilots to the base to air
[90.56 - 96.24] traffic control. Air traffic control
[93.12 - 98.80] they have no access to or understand on
[96.24 - 100.32] any level because it's classified. We're
[98.80 - 102.16] also talking a little bit in this
[100.32 - 105.04] episode about the conditions of the
[102.16 - 107.52] chemtrail planes and the condition of
[105.04 - 109.76] commercial airplanes and the difference
[107.52 - 112.24] between the both of them and what that
[109.76 - 114.56] all means and how that plays a role to
[112.24 - 116.40] what's happening up there in the sky.
[114.56 - 119.12] And just when you think that's it for
[116.40 - 120.80] this episode, hang on to your bridges
[119.12 - 123.20] because we're going to be talking about
[120.80 - 125.68] how chemtrails travel, but not just
[123.20 - 129.36] travel around this planet, but travel
[125.68 - 131.92] instead through the paranormal triangles
[129.36 - 135.08] and how that's not a good thing. We're
[131.92 - 137.28] going a little deeper in episode 6 in
[135.08 - 140.44] extraterrestrials and how there's a good
[137.28 - 143.12] percentage the chemtrol planes and the
[140.44 - 145.04] geoplanes have to worry in the coming
[143.12 - 146.44] years ahead. When it comes down to
[145.04 - 149.12] aliens and
[146.44 - 152.56] extraterrestrials, friend or a foe,
[149.12 - 154.72] friend or a foe, it all depends. When
[152.56 - 157.68] somebody's planet is getting littered
[154.72 - 160.80] with toxic chemicals and unknown toxic
[157.68 - 164.24] waste that's entering their atmosphere
[160.80 - 167.12] through a gateway, a channel, a channel
[164.24 - 169.68] of paranormal means. So hang on for this
[167.12 - 173.20] ride. Strap yourself in. Fasten your
[169.68 - 176.56] seat belts because your mind is about to
[173.20 - 179.53] be blown. We're going on another plane
[176.56 - 182.67] ride.
[179.53 - 182.67] [Music]
[199.04 - 203.68] Sometimes it's every other day you hear
[201.04 - 205.16] about a plane problem, some kind of
[203.68 - 209.00] problem,
[205.16 - 212.16] malfunction, a bad landing, a fire in an
[209.00 - 214.56] engine. You hear about two seaters going
[212.16 - 217.04] down. You hear about three people dying
[214.56 - 219.68] in a small plane crash. You hear about a
[217.04 - 221.36] plane almost hitting another plane, a
[219.68 - 223.44] plane landing almost hitting another
[221.36 - 226.16] plane, a plane taking off almost hitting
[223.44 - 228.88] another plane. The media reports about
[226.16 - 232.48] it all the time. And then you hear about
[228.88 - 234.80] fights on planes, arguments on planes,
[232.48 - 236.48] problems on planes, all kinds of
[234.80 - 239.68] different issues. You hear about
[236.48 - 242.00] somebody going to bathroom on a plane in
[239.68 - 244.24] the walkway where their feces are
[242.00 - 246.16] scattered about all over the floor. And
[244.24 - 248.16] then you hear about people vomiting,
[246.16 - 251.36] projectile vomiting on a bunch of other
[248.16 - 253.68] people and the plane has to head to land
[251.36 - 255.44] to a different airport out of nowhere.
[253.68 - 257.76] And what about people getting arrested
[255.44 - 260.80] on planes? That's something you hear in
[257.76 - 263.44] the news as well. The media covers that.
[260.80 - 266.08] It's endless. We can go on all day about
[263.44 - 269.04] it. But what's interesting is commercial
[266.08 - 272.64] planes and small private planes only
[269.04 - 275.04] make up a tiny fraction of the airspace
[272.64 - 277.60] up there. a tiny fraction of what's
[275.04 - 278.68] flying around in the airspace up there.
[277.60 - 281.60] A tiny
[278.68 - 284.08] fraction compared to chemtrail planes
[281.60 - 285.84] and geoengineering planes. So, you have
[284.08 - 288.80] to do the math. You have to take a look
[285.84 - 290.72] at it. If that tiny fraction of planes,
[288.80 - 293.04] commercial planes, and small private
[290.72 - 295.76] planes, fill up the media with
[293.04 - 298.00] incidents, accidents, and problems and
[295.76 - 300.64] tragedies and disasters. And it's
[298.00 - 302.96] reported on almost every other day or
[300.64 - 305.04] every day out there globally. And once
[302.96 - 307.28] again, it only makes up a fraction of
[305.04 - 309.20] what's flying around in the airspace. It
[307.28 - 311.36] only makes up a fraction of what's up
[309.20 - 313.36] there in the sky. So what does that mean
[311.36 - 315.60] for the majority of the planes that are
[313.36 - 317.64] flying up there? Does that mean the
[315.60 - 320.16] millions and millions of chemtrail
[317.64 - 322.88] planes, the millions of geoengineering
[320.16 - 326.00] planes all around the globe leaving
[322.88 - 328.24] trails day in day out, night day, every
[326.00 - 330.32] minute, everywhere? Does that mean not
[328.24 - 333.96] one of them has an incident? Not one of
[330.32 - 336.40] them has a tragedy or a crash or a
[333.96 - 338.32] disaster? Not one of them has an engine
[336.40 - 340.96] that blows up? Not one of them has a
[338.32 - 343.76] fire inside the plane. Not one of them
[340.96 - 346.40] has to land on an emergency basis.
[343.76 - 348.80] Hundreds and hundreds of thousands of
[346.40 - 350.96] chemtrail planes, thousands of
[348.80 - 353.92] geoengineering planes in the US alone
[350.96 - 355.60] flying around. And not one problem. Of
[353.92 - 357.20] course, the chemtrail planes are having
[355.60 - 358.88] problems. And of course the
[357.20 - 360.84] geoengineering planes are having
[358.88 - 364.48] problems. Of course they're having
[360.84 - 367.40] malfunctions, emergency landings, fires,
[364.48 - 370.16] engine blowups, pilot
[367.40 - 372.56] complications. But you'll never know and
[370.16 - 374.96] the media won't care and the media
[372.56 - 377.12] doesn't want to know. And the media will
[374.96 - 379.16] never know anyway. And they'll never
[377.12 - 382.24] have the interest to look and try to
[379.16 - 384.24] see. And corrupt media outlets all
[382.24 - 386.48] around the globe, they don't want to
[384.24 - 388.48] report on it. They don't want to just
[386.48 - 390.72] snap out of it and realize there's
[388.48 - 393.68] chemtrails everywhere. They don't want
[390.72 - 396.08] to look into it, understand it, find out
[393.68 - 398.80] how to fix it. And maybe you're somebody
[396.08 - 400.64] that has a trusted media source. And
[398.80 - 403.12] maybe that trusted media source that you
[400.64 - 405.52] get your information from is mainstream.
[403.12 - 408.00] Or maybe it's not mainstream and it's
[405.52 - 409.60] more on the fringe. And you trust the
[408.00 - 412.64] political information you're getting
[409.60 - 414.56] from it. You trust all the wellness
[412.64 - 416.32] information you're getting from it. You
[414.56 - 417.56] trust everything you're getting from it
[416.32 - 419.76] or almost
[417.56 - 422.00] everything. But yet, you're not going to
[419.76 - 423.44] hear about these chemtrails. You're not
[422.00 - 425.52] going to hear about the information
[423.44 - 427.44] we're talking about here. You're not
[425.52 - 429.68] going to hear about the geoengineering
[427.44 - 432.72] or truly what it's about. You might
[429.68 - 434.88] start hearing a vague geoengineering
[432.72 - 437.76] term out there. And you might start
[434.88 - 439.92] hearing about injecting possible weather
[437.76 - 443.44] manipulation, weather modification
[439.92 - 445.44] agents in the sky. But that's about it.
[443.44 - 447.76] It's going to stop there. Shops going to
[445.44 - 450.80] be closed. And when the media does start
[447.76 - 452.04] talking a little bit about that, a
[450.80 - 453.84] little bit about
[452.04 - 456.72] geoengineering, they're either going to
[453.84 - 458.72] side up with it, or of course, not give
[456.72 - 461.12] any full explanation or true
[458.72 - 463.44] understanding or depth about it out
[461.12 - 466.00] there. They're not going to go there, at
[463.44 - 469.12] least not now. Maybe in the future
[466.00 - 471.44] someday, but for nefarious reasons, but
[469.12 - 474.40] at least not now. They'll report on
[471.44 - 476.96] alien sightings. They'll actually report
[474.40 - 480.48] on those. They'll even report on an
[476.96 - 482.80] alien sighting in someone's backyard.
[480.48 - 485.12] They won't talk about the chemtrails.
[482.80 - 487.12] Let's hope they do. But even in this
[485.12 - 489.76] moment, if you listen to any one of
[487.12 - 492.60] these chemtrail episodes, you'll get a
[489.76 - 495.48] banner. The banner will say,
[492.60 - 498.48] "Contrails, courteous of Wikipedia,
[495.48 - 500.80] fakeipedia, of course. Global powers
[498.48 - 503.60] don't want chemtrails to stop. It's how
[500.80 - 506.24] they bank trillions of dollars. Global
[503.60 - 508.56] powers are okay with political change
[506.24 - 512.16] because they think it's temporary. They
[508.56 - 515.04] think over time the tide will shift. But
[512.16 - 517.84] chemtrails have to keep on pumping. They
[515.04 - 521.04] have to keep on going. Chemtrail planes
[517.84 - 523.68] have to keep on flying. That can't stop.
[521.04 - 525.68] They do not want that to stop ever. Now,
[523.68 - 528.40] when it comes down to the condition that
[525.68 - 530.48] chemtrail planes are in, it's a better
[528.40 - 532.88] condition than regular commercial planes
[530.48 - 534.96] that everybody flies because commercial
[532.88 - 537.92] airline companies are known to penny
[534.96 - 540.80] pinch. Torn seat covers and worn out
[537.92 - 543.52] bathrooms are common. Broken levers and
[540.80 - 545.44] scratched food trays also occur. All
[543.52 - 547.92] signs that if the inside of the planes
[545.44 - 551.04] are starting to get worn and torn and
[547.92 - 555.28] older, then that can equal to landing
[551.04 - 557.36] gear, tires, engines, and computers. So,
[555.28 - 559.92] chemtrail planes are taken care of
[557.36 - 561.76] better. There's a few reasons for that.
[559.92 - 564.40] One of those reasons is they don't want
[561.76 - 565.88] the planes going down. Now, the planes
[564.40 - 567.92] still go down. There's still
[565.88 - 570.24] malfunctions. There's still emergency
[567.92 - 572.56] landings. There's still crashes. There's
[570.24 - 574.80] still tragedies, but nobody knows about
[572.56 - 576.96] those. But yet, they want less of those
[574.80 - 579.44] because there's more chemtrail planes in
[576.96 - 581.52] the sky and more geoengineering planes
[579.44 - 585.28] in the sky than there are commercial
[581.52 - 587.92] planes. And yes, no airliner, no company
[585.28 - 589.88] wants any plane to go down. In fact,
[587.92 - 592.48] they just don't. But there's still a
[589.88 - 595.76] difference because if chemtrail planes
[592.48 - 598.80] go down, geoengineering planes go down,
[595.76 - 602.24] epic toxic disasters occur and it could
[598.80 - 604.72] gain attention. The chemtrail plane goes
[602.24 - 607.76] down in a village somewhere in the world
[604.72 - 611.76] or a town or a city in the middle of a
[607.76 - 614.56] city and blows up and 50,000 gallons,
[611.76 - 617.20] 20,000 gallons or 5,000 gallons of chem
[614.56 - 619.04] dump out and go all over the streets all
[617.20 - 621.60] the way down or blow up and burn
[619.04 - 622.56] everywhere, then there's a big problem.
[621.60 - 624.96] There's going to be a major
[622.56 - 627.20] investigation and authorities, public
[624.96 - 629.28] authorities may start peeking into what
[627.20 - 632.00] kind of plane was this? Especially if
[629.28 - 635.48] there's no passengers on the plane, just
[632.00 - 638.44] a pilot or two, the plane becomes
[635.48 - 640.48] mysterious, mysterious to public
[638.44 - 643.04] authorities. They can't have these
[640.48 - 646.08] planes go down because of this reason.
[643.04 - 648.96] So when parts manufacturing goes scarce,
[646.08 - 651.84] like when CO occurred, a feeding frenzy
[648.96 - 654.72] happens. The classified geoengineering
[651.84 - 657.52] industry and chemtrail industry will pay
[654.72 - 659.60] the highest prices and stop up all the
[657.52 - 661.36] parts, all the new parts in the
[659.60 - 663.28] industry. Now, keep in mind
[661.36 - 665.36] geoengineering industry and the
[663.28 - 666.96] chemtrail industry. They're also
[665.36 - 669.12] rebuilding their own planes,
[666.96 - 670.80] refurbishing their own planes, and
[669.12 - 672.80] building and manufacturing their own
[670.80 - 674.56] parts, too. But they're also putting
[672.80 - 676.96] more planes every day in the sky than
[674.56 - 678.80] any commercial airliner can ever. So,
[676.96 - 681.32] they're always going to need more parts.
[678.80 - 684.00] And when COVID hit and manufacturing was
[681.32 - 686.48] scarce, commercial airline companies
[684.00 - 688.56] won't pay the price or can't pay the
[686.48 - 690.80] price. They couldn't afford it. They
[688.56 - 694.00] could not match the chemtrail industry
[690.80 - 696.64] or the geoengineering industry. So what
[694.00 - 699.60] happens is the commercial airliners tend
[696.64 - 701.84] to use refurbished parts when times are
[699.60 - 704.24] tricky. Not all the time, but just like
[701.84 - 706.72] when COVID happened and parts were
[704.24 - 709.44] scarce, it was a tricky time. It was a
[706.72 - 712.00] pandemic, for example. Chemtrail planes
[709.44 - 715.12] and geoengineering planes cannot afford
[712.00 - 717.60] to go down. Too much can be discovered.
[715.12 - 720.88] Let's talk about the black box. All
[717.60 - 723.20] commercial airliners have a black box, a
[720.88 - 724.88] flight recorder. So the mystery can be
[723.20 - 727.52] solved if something happened to the
[724.88 - 729.84] plane. pilots being recorded,
[727.52 - 732.96] information being collected, all feeds
[729.84 - 735.16] into the black box, including all sounds
[732.96 - 738.44] and movement and positions of flight
[735.16 - 740.56] controls. And most importantly, radio
[738.44 - 743.68] communications. Now, make note of that
[740.56 - 746.00] one. Radio communications. That is a
[743.68 - 748.96] critical one for what we're about to
[746.00 - 751.72] talk about next. Chemtrail planes and
[748.96 - 755.36] geoengineering planes do not have black
[751.72 - 757.84] boxes. They don't keep flight recorders.
[755.36 - 761.72] There's a critical reason for this. When
[757.84 - 764.16] a chemtrail plane goes down and public
[761.72 - 766.80] authorities are looking after the plane
[764.16 - 769.04] crash and they take control over the
[766.80 - 771.36] incident, the accident or the tragedy,
[769.04 - 774.24] it's imperative that the public
[771.36 - 777.36] authorities do not take control of that
[774.24 - 780.00] black box. It's important that they do
[777.36 - 782.56] not obtain that flight recorder because
[780.00 - 784.96] if they do and that's a chemtrail plane
[782.56 - 787.20] or a geoengineering plane and public
[784.96 - 789.52] authorities have control over their
[787.20 - 792.00] black box, their flight recorders, then
[789.52 - 794.56] there's a huge problem. It means they're
[792.00 - 797.76] going to hear the pilots talking to an
[794.56 - 800.64] air traffic control that is an unknown
[797.76 - 803.84] classified air traffic control. Nothing
[800.64 - 806.08] that they know of. a private entity they
[803.84 - 809.08] know nothing about and then there's
[806.08 - 812.56] potential of the chemtrail industry or
[809.08 - 815.20] geoengineering industry being discovered
[812.56 - 817.36] or evidence of what they're doing. So
[815.20 - 820.08] there can't be black boxes which are
[817.36 - 824.08] really orange mostly but there can't be
[820.08 - 826.72] black boxes on chemtrail planes on
[824.08 - 828.72] geoengineering planes. Now, it's bad
[826.72 - 831.84] enough that if a chemtrail plane goes
[828.72 - 834.56] down and it's empty, doesn't have seats
[831.84 - 836.96] or passengers, instead chemical tanks
[834.56 - 840.32] built in it, and it's spewed all over a
[836.96 - 842.80] highway or in a town or a city, that's
[840.32 - 845.20] bad enough as it is. Never mind
[842.80 - 847.76] obtaining a black box with
[845.20 - 850.04] communications on it. Communications of
[847.76 - 852.88] pilots talking to air traffic
[850.04 - 855.44] controllers, private classified air
[852.88 - 857.12] traffic controllers, and about what?
[855.44 - 859.36] about the chemicals they're releasing in
[857.12 - 862.00] the sky, what they're dumping, what
[859.36 - 864.16] they're doing. The information on those
[862.00 - 866.48] communications is much different than a
[864.16 - 869.20] commercial airliner and a pilot talking
[866.48 - 871.28] to air traffic control. And this is why
[869.20 - 872.64] there are no black boxes on those
[871.28 - 876.12] chemtrail planes and those
[872.64 - 879.22] geoengineering planes.
[876.12 - 879.22] [Music]
[882.93 - 889.89] [Music]
[898.48 - 902.48] So, let's talk about identifying a
[900.24 - 905.92] chemtrail plane. It's actually pretty
[902.48 - 908.80] easy because chemtrail planes fly lower
[905.92 - 911.20] than commercial planes. Geoengineering
[908.80 - 914.88] planes and chemtrail planes fly around
[911.20 - 918.32] 20,000 ft instead of 30,000 ft like
[914.88 - 922.32] commercial airliners and many times
[918.32 - 924.16] 15,000 ft which is not that high. Now of
[922.32 - 927.60] course a commercial airliner can fly
[924.16 - 930.48] 15,000 ft. A commercial airliner can fly
[927.60 - 933.08] 20,000 ft when they're coming close to
[930.48 - 935.36] the airport when they're a few miles
[933.08 - 937.92] away. when they're actually coming in
[935.36 - 940.88] for the last 15 minutes of the journey,
[937.92 - 944.08] the trip, they start to descend. But
[940.88 - 946.56] you'll never see a chemtrail behind a
[944.08 - 948.92] commercial plane. You'll never see a
[946.56 - 951.88] white streak behind a commercial plane
[948.92 - 954.56] ever in your day, in your
[951.88 - 957.28] lifetime. Never a white streak that's
[954.56 - 960.32] miles long. It's not going to happen.
[957.28 - 963.36] Unless it's an old used up retired
[960.32 - 965.20] commercial airplane that was adopted by
[963.36 - 967.60] the chemtrol program or the
[965.20 - 970.24] geoengineering program or an old
[967.60 - 973.68] commercial plane that's now forgotten
[970.24 - 976.64] about because the airliner company went
[973.68 - 978.64] bankrupt many many years ago. So the
[976.64 - 981.24] entire fleet was taken over by the
[978.64 - 984.64] chemtrail program, the geoengineering
[981.24 - 986.88] program. Mostly the chemtrail programs
[984.64 - 990.40] take the old planes, the old commercial
[986.88 - 992.96] planes. But you'll never see a chemtrail
[990.40 - 995.76] or a geoengineering trail, the white
[992.96 - 998.32] streaks behind a commercial airplane
[995.76 - 1000.64] where there's passengers on it or behind
[998.32 - 1003.76] a commercial airplane that dropped off
[1000.64 - 1005.36] passengers and now it's flying empty.
[1003.76 - 1008.00] Now, the reason why we're talking about
[1005.36 - 1010.08] this identifying chemtrail planes and
[1008.00 - 1012.56] geoengineering planes and the white
[1010.08 - 1015.12] streaks behind them versus commercial
[1012.56 - 1017.36] flights with passengers on them is
[1015.12 - 1020.40] because of the paranormal triangles, the
[1017.36 - 1022.96] Bermuda Triangle, Alaskan Triangle, and
[1020.40 - 1027.12] many other triangles because commercial
[1022.96 - 1030.96] flights don't pose a greater risk in
[1027.12 - 1033.84] these triangles as chemtrail planes do
[1030.96 - 1036.40] and geoengineering planes do. So, let's
[1033.84 - 1038.00] talk about what that greater risk is.
[1036.40 - 1040.40] I'm sure you've heard about the
[1038.00 - 1042.24] paranormal triangles, the Alaska
[1040.40 - 1044.72] triangle and the Bermuda Triangle and
[1042.24 - 1046.56] many more. Now, not all the triangles
[1044.72 - 1049.32] that people are talking about out there
[1046.56 - 1052.24] are legit. People are looking for
[1049.32 - 1054.24] triangles. They're interested. They want
[1052.24 - 1057.60] many triangles out there, and there are
[1054.24 - 1060.40] many, but not every triangle people say
[1057.60 - 1063.04] is a triangle is a mysterious paranormal
[1060.40 - 1065.64] triangle. And one of the things is
[1063.04 - 1068.80] paranormal triangles aren't just
[1065.64 - 1072.04] triangle. They're circles. They've been
[1068.80 - 1075.32] identified and estimated as
[1072.04 - 1078.56] triangles. They've been noted as
[1075.32 - 1081.40] triangles, documented as triangles, but
[1078.56 - 1084.16] in reality, not all of them are
[1081.40 - 1086.16] triangles. They're actually circles.
[1084.16 - 1088.64] They're areas that are actually
[1086.16 - 1091.04] circular. And in these paranormal
[1088.64 - 1093.28] triangles, which are actually circular,
[1091.04 - 1095.68] at least most of them are, there's a lot
[1093.28 - 1098.92] of UFO sightings. There's a lot of
[1095.68 - 1101.48] sightings of light beams, of light
[1098.92 - 1103.72] circles, of crafts, of
[1101.48 - 1106.48] spaceships, also
[1103.72 - 1109.12] disappearances, missing ships, missing
[1106.48 - 1111.84] planes over the last 100 years. So,
[1109.12 - 1115.36] where do chemtrails and geoengineering
[1111.84 - 1119.04] trails fall into this? Where do these
[1115.36 - 1124.00] play a role? They play a role by acting
[1119.04 - 1125.16] as a magnet for alien races, as a magnet
[1124.00 - 1127.28] for
[1125.16 - 1130.56] extraterrestrials, for unidentified
[1127.28 - 1132.72] objects, spacecrafts, spaceships,
[1130.56 - 1135.12] chemtrail planes, the chemtrail
[1132.72 - 1138.72] programs, and the geoengineering planes
[1135.12 - 1141.92] and programs act as bait. They act like
[1138.72 - 1145.68] a worm on a hook. The chemtrails can
[1141.92 - 1148.64] draw unwanted guests. Aliens we don't
[1145.68 - 1151.04] want flying here. Aliens we don't want
[1148.64 - 1154.56] in our airspace. We don't want flying
[1151.04 - 1156.96] around Earth. Possible rogue aliens, not
[1154.56 - 1159.92] good ones. None of the aliens that are
[1156.96 - 1163.20] in the peace treaty. Rogue aliens that
[1159.92 - 1165.68] are baited to come. They're attracted.
[1163.20 - 1168.96] They're lured in. And what are they
[1165.68 - 1171.92] lured in by? The pollution, the
[1168.96 - 1175.20] dangerous chemicals, the toxic waste
[1171.92 - 1177.92] being dumped in the sky. the chemtrails,
[1175.20 - 1181.16] the geoengineering trails because what
[1177.92 - 1184.00] happens is that gets sucked into the
[1181.16 - 1186.64] triangles that gets sucked into the
[1184.00 - 1189.60] circles. It gets sucked into the Bermuda
[1186.64 - 1192.24] Triangle, to the Alaska Triangle. And
[1189.60 - 1195.36] where do those trails go? Those trails
[1192.24 - 1197.44] go into a portal, a wormhole, right
[1195.36 - 1200.88] through the triangle, right through the
[1197.44 - 1203.68] paranormal triangles and circles and
[1200.88 - 1206.48] into the atmosphere of another planet in
[1203.68 - 1209.52] another solar system, either in another
[1206.48 - 1211.92] galaxy or in this galaxy. So even though
[1209.52 - 1214.40] chemtrail planes and geoengineering
[1211.92 - 1217.68] planes don't normally go over the
[1214.40 - 1221.20] Bermuda Triangle, don't normally go over
[1217.68 - 1223.28] the Alaska Triangle, they go near them
[1221.20 - 1225.76] and all the chemicals being dumped out
[1223.28 - 1229.44] of them, the trails go into the
[1225.76 - 1232.80] triangle, into the circles. And then all
[1229.44 - 1235.36] of a sudden, if a portal opens in that
[1232.80 - 1237.60] circle in that paranormal triangle,
[1235.36 - 1239.92] whatever's in there in that airspace
[1237.60 - 1243.84] gets sucked through it. So if there was
[1239.92 - 1246.16] a ship or a plane, it could go missing.
[1243.84 - 1249.76] But here's how it works. There's so much
[1246.16 - 1253.16] toxic waste in the sky in the atmosphere
[1249.76 - 1256.88] floating over those triangles that it
[1253.16 - 1260.00] increases greatly the chances of that
[1256.88 - 1262.72] chemical, those trails entering a portal
[1260.00 - 1265.44] at any given time and entering another
[1262.72 - 1267.92] airspace on another planet with highly
[1265.44 - 1269.52] advanced life forms. And most of that
[1267.92 - 1271.44] toxic waste is coming from the
[1269.52 - 1274.80] geoengineering planes and the chemtrail
[1271.44 - 1277.84] planes. And as that toxic waste sucks
[1274.80 - 1281.24] through that vortex, sucks through that
[1277.84 - 1284.32] portal and gets to another planet, we're
[1281.24 - 1287.44] littering another planet's atmosphere.
[1284.32 - 1289.36] And if that planet is highly advanced,
[1287.44 - 1291.60] they're not going to put up with it.
[1289.36 - 1294.32] Especially if that planet is highly
[1291.60 - 1297.04] advanced and aggressive and understands
[1294.32 - 1299.68] the channels in which to travel from
[1297.04 - 1302.40] from point A to point B, like where the
[1299.68 - 1305.52] chemicals are coming from. if they can
[1302.40 - 1308.32] lock it down and travel from point A to
[1305.52 - 1311.12] point B, their planet through that
[1308.32 - 1313.44] channel to our planet to find out why
[1311.12 - 1315.68] that littering is happening. Then there
[1313.44 - 1317.68] could be trouble, lots of trouble. It
[1315.68 - 1320.08] could happen tomorrow. It could happen
[1317.68 - 1322.80] 10 years from now. It can happen 30
[1320.08 - 1325.60] years from now. But it can happen. The
[1322.80 - 1328.32] paranormal triangles just don't go to
[1325.60 - 1330.64] one planet out there. It just doesn't
[1328.32 - 1333.08] connect to just one planet out there.
[1330.64 - 1335.76] It's a constant revolving group of
[1333.08 - 1338.24] doors. And many of the planets that the
[1335.76 - 1340.88] paranormal circles, paranormal triangles
[1338.24 - 1343.48] connect to may be involved in the peace
[1340.88 - 1345.84] treaty. Whether they're good or bad
[1343.48 - 1348.16] aliens, they can still be involved in
[1345.84 - 1350.64] the peace treaty. The peace treaty here
[1348.16 - 1353.76] on Earth, making sure there isn't any
[1350.64 - 1356.08] wars or battles up there, battles up
[1353.76 - 1358.00] there in the sky. But keep in mind, as
[1356.08 - 1361.28] more and more chemtrails get sucked
[1358.00 - 1363.44] through the triangles and the circles
[1361.28 - 1366.00] and end up on other planets because it's
[1363.44 - 1368.80] a constant revolving door, there could
[1366.00 - 1371.68] eventually be an aggressive race, an
[1368.80 - 1373.44] aggressive extraterrestrial race that
[1371.68 - 1375.76] doesn't want to put up with it and
[1373.44 - 1378.80] doesn't care about any peace treaties
[1375.76 - 1381.56] here. And then they send an army through
[1378.80 - 1383.92] that wormhole, an army through that
[1381.56 - 1386.40] vortex, through that opening, through
[1383.92 - 1389.20] that gateway in search of the ones
[1386.40 - 1391.60] responsible for littering their planet.
[1389.20 - 1395.72] Because the last thing they want is
[1391.60 - 1398.96] large swaths of toxins, toxic chemicals,
[1395.72 - 1402.08] aerosols, metals, industrial metals of
[1398.96 - 1404.48] unknown origin. And seeking the ones
[1402.08 - 1407.72] responsible for littering all of that
[1404.48 - 1410.56] and it getting to their planets may mean
[1407.72 - 1412.40] anything. It could mean removing the
[1410.56 - 1415.84] chemtrail planes and removing the
[1412.40 - 1418.16] geoengineering planes, evaporating them,
[1415.84 - 1420.40] getting rid of them. But it could also
[1418.16 - 1424.24] lead to what people talk about out
[1420.40 - 1428.80] there, an alien war against humans.
[1424.24 - 1431.52] Alien races coming in and battling us
[1428.80 - 1433.28] humans. A war on the Earth. Something
[1431.52 - 1436.40] that everybody's talked about for years
[1433.28 - 1439.56] and years. And if there's ever a way
[1436.40 - 1442.96] this could happen, it would be a rogue
[1439.56 - 1445.92] extraterrestrial race, an alien race
[1442.96 - 1449.04] that's tired of getting polluted by the
[1445.92 - 1451.28] chemtrails, the onslaught of deadly,
[1449.04 - 1453.72] dangerous, toxic chemicals constantly
[1451.28 - 1456.24] getting into their airspace through the
[1453.72 - 1458.72] triangles, through the circles, the
[1456.24 - 1460.40] paranormal triangles and circles.
[1458.72 - 1462.64] Because in the end, what do they have to
[1460.40 - 1465.44] lose if it's detrimental to their
[1462.64 - 1467.68] planet? And that alien race, that rogue
[1465.44 - 1469.84] alien race, is not going to care about
[1467.68 - 1472.00] the peace treaty of good aliens and
[1469.84 - 1474.32] other bad aliens here that are already
[1472.00 - 1476.88] flying around our atmosphere, already in
[1474.32 - 1479.72] our airspace here on Earth. They may not
[1476.88 - 1482.40] care about peace treaties or deals or
[1479.72 - 1485.12] contracts. They may not care about who's
[1482.40 - 1487.28] mining what, what aliens are doing, what
[1485.12 - 1489.60] kind of deals with the humans they have.
[1487.28 - 1492.08] So, it could be those very chemtrails
[1489.60 - 1494.88] and those very geoengineering trails
[1492.08 - 1496.80] that triggers off the true problems that
[1494.88 - 1499.04] people talk about that they're awaiting
[1496.80 - 1502.48] for down the road when it comes down to
[1499.04 - 1505.36] aliens and humans battling. Or there's a
[1502.48 - 1507.28] good percentage and a good chance it's
[1505.36 - 1509.12] just going to be about the chemtrails,
[1507.28 - 1512.08] the chemtrail planes and the
[1509.12 - 1514.88] geoengineering planes and that aliens
[1512.08 - 1517.68] from another planet. Just focus on those
[1514.88 - 1520.64] and only those because that's the
[1517.68 - 1523.44] pollution that's traveling through that
[1520.64 - 1525.60] gateway, through that avenue to their
[1523.44 - 1527.44] planet, to their airspace, and they'll
[1525.60 - 1529.36] want it stopped. If you get a chance,

[1566.08 - 1571.12] don't know, like 7 miles from the
[1567.44 - 1573.36] Bermuda Triangle. Well, at our speed.
[1571.12 - 1574.12] Yeah. Well, what are we doing? 400 miles
[1573.36 - 1575.88] an
[1574.12 - 1578.24] hour.
[1575.88 - 1580.04] Yeah. Then we're 6 miles now from the
[1578.24 - 1583.76] Bermuda
[1580.04 - 1586.16] Triangle. Okay. We're 5 miles now. Why
[1583.76 - 1588.56] are you nervous? It's not like anything
[1586.16 - 1590.72] happens in the Bermuda Triangle. He
[1588.56 - 1594.16] can't be just like fallen for every
[1590.72 - 1597.24] single thing. What? You know a story?
[1594.16 - 1599.20] What? What is it? What? A a friend's
[1597.24 - 1601.40] plane that was on the edge of the
[1599.20 - 1604.80] Bermuda Triangle? What
[1601.40 - 1607.84] happened? All of a suddenly the controls
[1604.80 - 1609.44] the controls on dashboard went. We're
[1607.84 - 1612.80] We're one mile away from the Bermuda
[1609.44 - 1614.16] Triangle. Okay, hang on. For some reason
[1612.80 - 1618.28] this it's getting bumpy. Maybe the
[1614.16 - 1620.44] ride's getting bumpy. Whoa. Whoa. Yep.
[1618.28 - 1622.40] Oh, that has a little
[1620.44 - 1624.96] turbulence. You think that has anything
[1622.40 - 1627.72] to do with crossing the triangle?
[1624.96 - 1630.40] Crossing into the triangle? You
[1627.72 - 1632.24] do? Should we turn turn around and try
[1630.40 - 1634.40] to skirt the ED where we're not going to
[1632.24 - 1637.12] make good timing, though? We're on a
[1634.40 - 1639.68] deadline. We got to get somewhere. Yeah.
[1637.12 - 1642.00] I I guess. Do we have enough fuel? Why
[1639.68 - 1645.12] don't we just cut through the triangle?
[1642.00 - 1646.96] I told you that that was the plan. We We
[1645.12 - 1649.80] have enough fuel to do it that way. If
[1646.96 - 1653.56] we turn around, we're going to have to
[1649.80 - 1657.12] Yeah. The dial is twisting. You see
[1653.56 - 1659.36] that? What altitude are we at? You're
[1657.12 - 1660.64] not sure? Okay. Okay. Let me Let me turn
[1659.36 - 1662.08] Let me just turn this thing around.
[1660.64 - 1664.96] Forget about the fuel. Let's just start
[1662.08 - 1668.08] moving out of here. Yep. All right. All
[1664.96 - 1670.88] right. Just hold on. Hold on. We're Yep.
[1668.08 - 1674.12] Let's Okay. Let's try to ascend, not
[1670.88 - 1677.68] descend. Let's try to ascend. Hold
[1674.12 - 1677.68] on. Whoa.
[1678.36 - 1684.64] Okay. This is flight 222 to the base.
[1681.52 - 1687.60] Can you read me? Over. This is the base.
[1684.64 - 1690.72] Flight 222. What's your position? We
[1687.60 - 1693.28] can't find you on the radar. Over. This
[1690.72 - 1696.16] is flight 222, sir. I think we're over
[1693.28 - 1699.96] the Alaska Triangle. And it wasn't on
[1696.16 - 1703.28] purpose, sir. It kind of drew us in.
[1699.96 - 1707.04] Over. Flight 222. This is the base. Turn
[1703.28 - 1709.52] left. Go north. Head to Anchorage. Over.
[1707.04 - 1710.84] This is flight 222 to the base. Wish it
[1709.52 - 1713.76] was that easy,
[1710.84 - 1716.88] sir. Tried that, sir. Running out of
[1713.76 - 1718.96] fuel. Actually running on fumes. Every
[1716.88 - 1721.36] time we try to get out of this triangle,
[1718.96 - 1724.96] we keep on getting sucked in. It's like
[1721.36 - 1727.12] a constant circle. Over. This is the
[1724.96 - 1730.12] base flight 222.
[1727.12 - 1734.24] Drop altitude 10,000 ft. Start
[1730.12 - 1736.32] descending over flight 222 to the base.
[1734.24 - 1738.40] Got something on our tail. Something's
[1736.32 - 1740.80] following us. It looks like a round
[1738.40 - 1743.92] ball. And now it's circling all around
[1740.80 - 1746.16] the plane. And now our gauges are
[1743.92 - 1749.12] getting wacky. Lights are blinking on
[1746.16 - 1752.88] and off. Landing gear went down. Now it
[1749.12 - 1756.40] went back up. Sir, over flight 222. This
[1752.88 - 1757.40] is the base. Keep on standby. Base. This
[1756.40 - 1760.48] is flight
[1757.40 - 1762.80] 222. Running out of fuel. Getting the
[1760.48 - 1764.64] parachutes ready. Looking for emergency
[1762.80 - 1767.44] door. Getting ready for emergency
[1764.64 - 1769.68] protocol. Sir, we're going to jump.
[1767.44 - 1771.68] Flight 222. This is the base. Can you
[1769.68 - 1775.28] see the ground? Can you see the ground
[1771.68 - 1778.00] out there? Any visibility. Over this
[1775.28 - 1780.60] flight 222. No visibility, sir. No
[1778.00 - 1783.44] visibility at all. Nothing but fog and
[1780.60 - 1785.44] cloud. No visibility and no control over
[1783.44 - 1787.28] the aircraft anymore. Running out of
[1785.44 - 1790.60] fuel as we speak, sir. We're getting
[1787.28 - 1793.92] ready to jump. Flight 222, this is the
[1790.60 - 1796.84] base. We see you on radar now. You're
[1793.92 - 1800.56] over water. I repeat, you're
[1796.84 - 1804.32] overwater. Do not jump. Flight 222, do
[1800.56 - 1806.76] not jump. I repeat, you're overwater.
[1804.32 - 1810.40] Come back.
[1806.76 - 1811.88] Over. Flight 222, do you read me? Do you
[1810.40 - 1814.88] read me?
[1811.88 - 1814.88] Over.
[1828.12 - 1832.48] Original published medical medium
[1830.32 - 1835.04] information gets stolen and poached by
[1832.48 - 1836.96] podcast doctors, social media doctors,
[1835.04 - 1838.72] influencers, and medical clinics.
[1836.96 - 1840.56] Medical medium information has never yet
[1838.72 - 1842.56] been proven wrong by medical science and
[1840.56 - 1844.24] research. instead the opposite. Only
[1842.56 - 1846.16] proven right and then taken from medical
[1844.24 - 1847.84] medium published material and used in
[1846.16 - 1849.84] the conventional and alternative health
[1847.84 - 1851.84] communities. Medical medium information
[1849.84 - 1853.36] continually sets the stage for medical
[1851.84 - 1855.36] science to understand chronic illness
[1853.36 - 1857.28] better. If you choose to share or use
[1855.36 - 1859.20] the original unique content from the
[1857.28 - 1861.52] Medical Medium podcast, books, or
[1859.20 - 1863.12] Medical Medium social media, please site
[1861.52 - 1864.48] where this information comes from so
[1863.12 - 1866.00] others who see and learn of this
[1864.48 - 1867.52] information have a chance to know where
[1866.00 - 1869.28] it all originates to give them an
[1867.52 - 1871.04] opportunity to heal so they don't end up
[1869.28 - 1873.04] losing years of their life searching for
[1871.04 - 1874.88] answers like so many have before them.
[1873.04 - 1876.88] The medical medium information here on
[1874.88 - 1878.80] this podcast doesn't come from broken
[1876.88 - 1880.80] science, interest groups, medical
[1878.80 - 1883.52] funding with strings attached, botched
[1880.80 - 1885.60] research, lobbyists, internal kickbacks,
[1883.52 - 1887.68] persuaded belief systems, private panels
[1885.60 - 1889.36] of influencers, health field payoffs,
[1887.68 - 1891.20] trendy traps, or gathered bits and
[1889.36 - 1893.12] pieces of gimmicky confusion. Because
[1891.20 - 1895.04] chronic illness is exploding like never
[1893.12 - 1896.88] before in our modern-day history, it
[1895.04 - 1898.72] takes a greater force than us down here.
[1896.88 - 1900.48] It takes a helping hand from above.
[1898.72 - 1902.16] Medical medium information has street
[1900.48 - 1903.36] cred. It's an organic movement of
[1902.16 - 1905.12] countless people around the world
[1903.36 - 1906.96] healing more healing stories of real
[1905.12 - 1909.12] people not being paid to tell their
[1906.96 - 1910.72] life-changing experiences of rising out
[1909.12 - 1912.80] of the ashes of sickness and entering
[1910.72 - 1914.48] into the light of full recovery, getting
[1912.80 - 1916.08] their lives back and finally healing
[1914.48 - 1917.44] when nothing else in the world of health

[1917.44 - 1921.92] better. The information on this podcast
