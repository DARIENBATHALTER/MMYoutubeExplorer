[35.44 - 38.56] really good episode It's really
[36.80 - 40.88] informative powerful packed up
[38.56 - 43.56] information we're talking about detoxing
[40.88 - 45.96] I'm excited about this where does this
[43.56 - 49.56] detoxing thing come from where does the
[45.96 - 51.00] term come from what is it about so I
[49.56 - 55.72] want to cover a couple things in the
[51.00 - 60.60] conventional World detox meant people
[55.72 - 63.32] going into a clinic and going through
[60.60 - 66.76] pharmaceutical withdrawal just for the
[63.32 - 69.56] record okay it wasn't about anything
[66.76 - 71.24] else besides going into a clinic and
[69.56 - 75.24] coming off of
[71.24 - 76.56] morphine that's the term detox in the
[75.24 - 79.24] conventional
[76.56 - 81.04] mindset very important really important
[79.24 - 82.88] topic here a lot of people are like I'm
[81.04 - 85.20] detoxing too much or I'm not detoxing
[82.88 - 87.28] enough or what's going on or my adrenals
[85.20 - 89.96] are hurt because I'm detoxing very
[87.28 - 92.84] important information we're covering but
[89.96 - 97.08] the conventional World detox was going
[92.84 - 99.44] into a clinic because you're on too much
[97.08 - 102.28] pharmaceutical and you're coming off of
[99.44 - 104.84] it or coming off of morphine or coming
[102.28 - 107.28] off of oxies or coming off of something
[104.84 - 109.76] else or even like benzo despine or
[107.28 - 111.56] something right coming off of heavy
[109.76 - 113.88] drugs and originally going back was
[111.56 - 116.08] morphine that's what it was about it's
[113.88 - 118.72] just all about morphine just letting you
[116.08 - 121.52] know and so that's where detox comes
[118.72 - 125.44] from on a conventional mindset on an
[121.52 - 129.88] alternative mindset get ready for this
[125.44 - 131.88] it's the old hygienic movement term
[129.88 - 135.00] detoxing now I want to cover this
[131.88 - 137.56] thoroughly this is important how did it
[135.00 - 140.88] come about well the word detox came
[137.56 - 141.80] about because people lived who lived in
[140.88 - 144.92] the
[141.80 - 148.04] cities were living in the toxic smog of
[144.92 - 151.48] the factories and all of the toxic
[148.04 - 153.72] surroundings and the car exhaust so what
[151.48 - 156.48] would happen is people would be also
[153.72 - 160.28] eating restaurant food too at the same
[156.48 - 165.20] time and early canned and packaged food
[160.28 - 168.84] early stuff early 1900s late 1800s old
[165.20 - 171.24] canaries canning all the food packaged
[168.84 - 173.60] food back then yeah and so it was all
[171.24 - 177.48] about like lead cans and all that other
[173.60 - 180.44] stuff so it was about toxic Lifestyles
[177.48 - 183.56] so it was about getting out of the city
[180.44 - 185.80] stopping partying and getting off of
[183.56 - 188.88] recreational drugs very important to
[185.80 - 191.72] know so in the alternative mindset
[188.88 - 195.00] detox was all about getting away from
[191.72 - 197.80] the fastpaced lifestyle of the day of
[195.00 - 201.48] the 1890s and the early
[197.80 - 204.36] 1900s it was all about the early drug
[201.48 - 208.44] movement it was all about the canned
[204.36 - 211.08] food and it was all about the partying
[208.44 - 214.40] and all about the MOG and the city
[211.08 - 216.16] living and so detoxing would be get you
[214.40 - 219.64] out of that environment in the early
[216.16 - 222.52] 1900s get you into a Country Manor
[219.64 - 225.16] somewhere right in the Hills or
[222.52 - 228.52] somewhere fresh air birds
[225.16 - 232.72] chirping kind of like sanitarium kind of
[228.52 - 235.20] like something that's a paradise nature
[232.72 - 237.92] getting away from the toxic lifestyle of
[235.20 - 239.68] the world the fast-paced world okay that
[237.92 - 241.96] was also part of the alternative mind
[239.68 - 244.20] mindset of detoxing and that even was
[241.96 - 246.52] partly with the conventional mindset too
[244.20 - 248.80] going back that far too a little bit but
[246.52 - 251.12] conventional mindset mainly focused on
[248.80 - 254.12] like getting off of morphine that was
[251.12 - 257.68] the detox all right so let's cut into
[254.12 - 261.32] this a little bit then the Whole Foods
[257.68 - 262.68] you know movement just eating like
[261.32 - 266.96] fruits and
[262.68 - 271.64] vegetables herbs okay and getting away
[266.96 - 275.00] from meat and this isn't a anti-meat
[271.64 - 276.60] talk or anti- you know animal protein
[275.00 - 279.36] talk or anything that's not what this is
[276.60 - 282.52] at all but it was the early days the
[279.36 - 286.56] early 1900s it was about getting away
[282.52 - 289.44] from restaurant food and
[286.56 - 292.00] beef and getting out of the
[289.44 - 294.76] cities and getting into a cleaner
[292.00 - 297.80] environment and getting off of all that
[294.76 - 300.12] heavy animal meat okay so that was the
[297.80 - 303.04] early alternative movement and instead
[300.12 - 306.52] it was about eating nuts and seeds and
[303.04 - 309.44] walnuts and almonds and cashews or
[306.52 - 312.68] whatever you know different seeds and
[309.44 - 316.96] all about that and sprouted grains and
[312.68 - 319.92] it was all about getting out of the
[316.96 - 321.76] cycle everybody was in the early 1900s
[319.92 - 325.20] where they were eating meat and
[321.76 - 329.12] restaurant food and were were using high
[325.20 - 331.12] salt and we in the smog and pollution
[329.12 - 332.72] and stress and it was about getting
[331.12 - 334.80] somebody out the hygienic movement was
[332.72 - 337.00] birthing and it was about getting that
[334.80 - 340.00] person out of
[337.00 - 341.88] that so they can actually be fre they
[340.00 - 343.84] would they would get them off meat and
[341.88 - 346.68] they would put them on nuts and seeds
[343.84 - 348.60] instead of meat and this would be all
[346.68 - 352.04] part of their
[348.60 - 354.48] detox see so the hygienic movement was
[352.04 - 357.36] birthed out of this
[354.48 - 360.72] mindset and the hygienic movement was
[357.36 - 362.24] all about your toxin sick so now you
[360.72 - 365.04] need to
[362.24 - 366.72] detox see where I'm going this is so
[365.04 - 368.08] important you guys I I want you to watch
[366.72 - 370.44] this from the beginning a couple of
[368.08 - 372.84] times if you can this is going to answer
[370.44 - 376.12] a billion questions I
[372.84 - 379.08] think and but the point is is so
[376.12 - 380.88] alternative medicine was about animal
[379.08 - 383.60] protein was making you sick do you guys
[380.88 - 385.00] get get my gist here I'm not saying
[383.60 - 386.92] animal protein makes you sick when have
[385.00 - 388.88] I ever said that that animal protein you
[386.92 - 390.64] know medical medium's never been about
[388.88 - 393.60] one or the other it's not has an
[390.64 - 396.60] attacked animal meat the point is is
[393.60 - 400.20] that the early hygienic movement was
[396.60 - 403.72] you're sick hear me now don't miss this
[400.20 - 405.48] point you're sick because you're eating
[403.72 - 409.44] animal
[405.48 - 412.48] meat and you have to get away from that
[409.44 - 414.84] and go plant-based plant
[412.48 - 416.36] foods and that's the hygienic movement
[414.84 - 418.84] you are
[416.36 - 422.68] toxic and then as the hygienic movement
[418.84 - 424.16] grew a little a little bit more desserts
[422.68 - 426.72] and sweets and
[424.16 - 429.36] treats were all part of it
[426.72 - 432.00] too so what happens is if you lived a
[429.36 - 434.44] conventional lifestyle in the
[432.00 - 438.12] 1930s the
[434.44 - 441.04] 1940s and you weren't feeling well they
[438.12 - 443.56] would say you need to take away all the
[441.04 - 447.16] sweets all of the
[443.56 - 449.92] Delicacies all of the rich
[447.16 - 453.60] food all of the meat
[449.92 - 455.32] Burgers they all had to go the hygienic
[453.60 - 456.96] movement but there's something really
[455.32 - 458.08] important to understand about this which
[456.96 - 460.84] will blow your
[458.08 - 463.48] mind the alternative hygienic movement
[460.84 - 466.20] did not know why you were sick they
[463.48 - 468.40] didn't know why someone had
[466.20 - 471.12] Tremors they didn't know why someone
[468.40 - 473.76] couldn't walk because they had like
[471.12 - 477.48] wobblers they didn't know why someone
[473.76 - 479.92] was fatigued deathly fatigued and
[477.48 - 481.96] bedridden they didn't know why people
[479.92 - 485.00] had all kinds of different
[481.96 - 487.16] symptoms from severe brain fog to ticks
[485.00 - 489.76] and spasms to aches and pains to tingles
[487.16 - 491.84] and numbness to not being able to sleep
[489.76 - 493.84] to everything from anxiety to depression
[491.84 - 495.96] to trigeminal neuralgia to pain in their
[493.84 - 498.60] jaw their neck their head everything
[495.96 - 500.00] they did not know why anyone had any of
[498.60 - 503.04] this this is so important the
[500.00 - 505.84] alternative hygienic movement of Health
[503.04 - 508.12] knew that you should detox that's they
[505.84 - 509.44] called it they did not know why anyone
[508.12 - 512.00] was sick they just thought it was
[509.44 - 515.20] because you're toxic you needed to detox
[512.00 - 519.32] that's all that's all they
[515.20 - 521.16] knew and they only knew that up
[519.32 - 524.68] until
[521.16 - 526.96] until now the medical medium info about
[524.68 - 529.44] bugs and pathogens and Epstein bars and
[526.96 - 530.92] hhb6 is making people sick and metals
[529.44 - 532.96] and all of that that wasn't in the
[530.92 - 534.88] hygienic frame it wasn't in the hygienic
[532.96 - 537.88] movement of Alternative Health at all on
[534.88 - 539.72] any level they only thought in the let's
[537.88 - 542.32] move pack now out of the 30 out of the
[539.72 - 544.88] 40s out of 1950s let's move up to the
[542.32 - 546.68] 80s they still believe the hygienic
[544.88 - 549.24] movement you just toxic and you needed
[546.68 - 551.04] to detox that's why you're sick and
[549.24 - 552.52] bedridden that's why you're not well
[551.04 - 553.76] that's why you got ticks and spasms
[552.52 - 555.76] aches and pains and your body's
[553.76 - 559.56] vibrating and got all these
[555.76 - 562.92] problems I still did not know that there
[559.56 - 566.20] were real reasons why people were sick
[562.92 - 569.72] because face it everybody's toxic then
[566.20 - 572.32] everyone is toxic you got
[569.72 - 575.08] understand this right you mean a UPS
[572.32 - 577.52] driver and the lawyer working at a law
[575.08 - 580.20] firm and the waitress working at the
[577.52 - 583.08] diner and the person checking out in the
[580.20 - 584.92] grocery store and the person working at
[583.08 - 587.72] this other place and the construction
[584.92 - 589.84] guy working here and the you know the
[587.72 - 591.56] bus driver that's working out there you
[589.84 - 592.96] mean to tell me and the doctor that's
[591.56 - 595.64] working here you mean to tell me they're
[592.96 - 597.08] all not toxic they're all out there
[595.64 - 599.60] living their life and they're living
[597.08 - 601.72] their life toxic but they may not be
[599.60 - 603.76] sick in the moment they may not be sick
[601.72 - 606.48] right now they may not have a whole
[603.76 - 610.04] bunch of symptoms you see what I'm
[606.48 - 612.44] saying so what would happen is everybody
[610.04 - 615.64] think about it everybody's toxic and
[612.44 - 618.16] everybody has toxins in them but the
[615.64 - 621.00] scale hasn't tipped yet or they haven't
[618.16 - 623.80] gotten sick yet so back to the
[621.00 - 626.12] alternative hygienic movement
[623.80 - 627.76] again so the hygienic movement just
[626.12 - 630.08] believed you were toxic and that's all
[627.76 - 634.08] they believed that's it that you had a
[630.08 - 637.80] detox it's a belief system it is a
[634.08 - 640.44] belief system ingrained in early
[637.80 - 643.32] alternative medicine please listen to
[640.44 - 644.24] this if you can and that belief system
[643.32 - 648.64] that was
[644.24 - 648.64] ingrained is still floating around right
[649.08 - 654.00] now and everybody's like your detox
[651.76 - 656.04] Pathways your detoxing too much or you
[654.00 - 657.72] don't know how to detox you're sick cuz
[656.04 - 659.44] you're detoxing too heavy you're
[657.72 - 661.64] bedridden because you're toxic in your
[659.44 - 664.24] detox they're still passing it around
[661.64 - 666.44] now it comes early comes from the early
[664.24 - 669.56] 1920s the early
[666.44 - 672.80] 1930s and that hygienic sense of detox
[669.56 - 676.20] is still haunting everybody to this
[672.80 - 679.64] day and that's the sad part confusion
[676.20 - 682.20] with detox is probably one of the most
[679.64 - 686.00] crazy epidemic things that's happening
[682.20 - 688.28] right now in the health movement right
[686.00 - 690.52] now I could just see some people
[688.28 - 692.60] watching this right now being so irrit
[690.52 - 694.52] irritated like wait a minute no that's
[692.60 - 696.72] not how it is wait detox
[694.52 - 699.48] detox because this is mind-blowing
[696.72 - 700.92] information so let's get into it check
[699.48 - 704.80] this
[700.92 - 709.12] out okay everybody is
[704.80 - 711.44] toxic everybody's got toxins in
[709.12 - 714.56] them but one person is going to be
[711.44 - 716.84] sitting there hurting really bad lots of
[714.56 - 718.60] body pain lots of fatigue and another
[716.84 - 720.44] person is not going to be sitting there
[718.60 - 723.40] with lot of fatigue and body
[720.44 - 726.40] pain they could be equally
[723.40 - 730.16] toxic equally
[726.40 - 734.20] toxic Mrs Jones is bedridden with
[730.16 - 734.20] fatigue and brain fog can't
[734.72 - 740.24] function Mr
[736.72 - 741.72] Jones just as toxic is out there mowing
[740.24 - 745.76] the
[741.72 - 749.40] lawn that's just a fact
[745.76 - 751.52] Jack okay everybody's toxic everybody
[749.40 - 753.60] gets toxic everybody's eating all kinds
[751.52 - 756.08] of [ __ ] and garbage everybody's doing
[753.60 - 759.00] all kinds of stuff everybody's walking
[756.08 - 762.00] around toxic but one person is bedridden
[759.00 - 763.80] another person is really horribly sick
[762.00 - 766.24] another person has 20 symptoms another
[763.80 - 768.04] person has 50 symptoms and what you're
[766.24 - 769.96] going to hear out there is you're just
[768.04 - 772.36] going to hear detox talk and detox talk
[769.96 - 774.48] and detox talk you're not detoxing
[772.36 - 776.20] enough you're detoxing too much your
[774.48 - 778.00] detox Pathways aren't working how would
[776.20 - 779.36] you know how' you know your detox
[778.00 - 781.56] pathways are working
[779.36 - 783.88] nobody knows that what there's some kind
[781.56 - 785.20] of computerized Imaging machine of some
[783.88 - 787.24] kind that can just you could stand in
[785.20 - 790.84] front and be like yeah see your detox
[787.24 - 793.60] pathway is not really run uh what is
[790.84 - 796.96] going out of your kidney huh doesn't
[793.60 - 799.36] exist it's make believe make
[796.96 - 802.84] believe so what's happened right now is
[799.36 - 805.00] the term detox has been weaponized it is
[802.84 - 806.92] weaponized and whenever something's
[805.00 - 807.88] weaponized people are going to get hurt
[806.92 - 810.12] they're going to get hurt they're going
[807.88 - 813.32] to get hurt
[810.12 - 815.88] and they are because it's a total
[813.32 - 818.32] confused vest of the
[815.88 - 819.68] mind and you see it every day out there
[818.32 - 820.92] so let's go into it a little bit more
[819.68 - 823.80] the hygienic
[820.92 - 827.48] movement just thinks people are sick
[823.80 - 830.88] because they need a detox that's all
[827.48 - 834.12] it's all they think it's an old staple
[830.88 - 837.16] it's been around and it's what you think
[834.12 - 839.60] you go back to the 80s you're toxic you
[837.16 - 842.68] go back to the '90s you're toxic toxic
[839.60 - 846.00] that's why that's all it is and you need
[842.68 - 846.00] a detox until you're
[847.96 - 852.28] healed but what happens if you don't
[850.00 - 853.96] heal oh you're not detoxed enough or
[852.28 - 856.72] you're detoxing too
[853.96 - 858.56] much nobody knows which way to go and
[856.72 - 862.00] nobody knows which way the wind blows on
[858.56 - 863.48] that it's Madness so let's clear the ear
[862.00 - 864.96] a little bit and what's happening so
[863.48 - 866.76] back to Conventional medicine and
[864.96 - 869.32] conventional mindset detox was just
[866.76 - 871.36] getting off of morphine
[869.32 - 873.32] alternative and detox was just getting
[871.36 - 875.48] off the morphine and leaving the cities
[873.32 - 878.60] alternative movement was detox was just
[875.48 - 880.24] getting rid of the riches and the sweets
[878.60 - 882.56] and getting out of the Cities out of the
[880.24 - 883.92] smog and that's it that's the reason why
[882.56 - 885.52] you're sick you're sick because you've
[883.92 - 887.32] eaten too much beef and you've gotten
[885.52 - 890.28] too much beef in your
[887.32 - 892.28] gut and you made yourself sick that is
[890.28 - 895.12] the original
[892.28 - 898.60] detoxification mindset there is it's
[895.12 - 900.64] beef it's beef it's beef that's what it
[898.60 - 903.84] is it is
[900.64 - 906.32] 1906 beef that's why you're sick baby
[903.84 - 910.72] 1910 it's beef that's why you're sick
[906.32 - 914.12] baby 1920 beef is why you're sick and
[910.72 - 919.36] some smog 1930 beef is why you're sick
[914.12 - 921.28] and some smog 1940 beef again and some
[919.36 - 926.00] smog do you
[921.28 - 930.60] see that is how it really happened and
[926.00 - 930.60] what goes down and has gone down
[930.84 - 934.88] now don't take this as I'm anti- beef or
[932.88 - 936.84] I'm anti- anything I'm just telling you
[934.88 - 938.68] about the history because nobody knows
[936.84 - 941.16] the history the history is critical and
[938.68 - 945.04] the details matter with
[941.16 - 949.32] this so then we went into the like weak
[945.04 - 952.40] grass movement coming into the mid 70s
[949.32 - 954.12] and early 70s where you're toxic and you
[952.40 - 956.36] need to cleanse and you need to get on
[954.12 - 960.00] your wheat grass and you need to get the
[956.36 - 962.08] toxins out and that's why you're sick
[960.00 - 964.12] and then it moved into the 80s you're
[962.08 - 966.56] toxic because you know and you got to
[964.12 - 968.76] get off the beef again and you got to
[966.56 - 971.68] get off this junk and garbage in the
[968.76 - 973.56] riches and the sweets you got to get off
[971.68 - 976.24] of this and stop eating your chocolate
[973.56 - 978.88] cake every day cuz you're
[976.24 - 981.28] toxic that's where it all stems from and
[978.88 - 983.64] comes from and it's haunted us since and
[981.28 - 986.68] it's still haunting everybody now it's
[983.64 - 989.36] just mindset of you're toxic you got to
[986.68 - 992.12] detox and it's nothing but but
[989.36 - 996.04] detox and that's the mindset coming from
[992.12 - 998.52] the hygienic movement which has cursed
[996.04 - 1002.20] it has
[998.52 - 1003.64] cursed alternative wellness and health
[1002.20 - 1007.68] it has cursed
[1003.64 - 1010.72] it so there is a curse upon the health
[1007.68 - 1012.28] movement and that curse will destroy and
[1010.72 - 1015.08] ruin
[1012.28 - 1016.36] lives 3 years from now someone gets sick
[1015.08 - 1017.80] for the first time in their life and
[1016.36 - 1019.24] they go into the health movement they're
[1017.80 - 1020.96] on the internet and they're talking to
[1019.24 - 1022.88] this person that person this doctor and
[1020.96 - 1024.16] this practitioner this coach and this in
[1022.88 - 1025.88] the end they're just going to get told
[1024.16 - 1027.56] they're probably detoxing too heavy or
[1025.88 - 1029.08] detoxing too much whether they're not
[1027.56 - 1031.00] detoxing enough or something to do with
[1029.08 - 1036.04] detox and they'll be
[1031.00 - 1038.40] cursed good luck trying to heal good
[1036.04 - 1040.84] luck let's go into it a little bit more
[1038.40 - 1042.80] now all
[1040.84 - 1045.60] right
[1042.80 - 1047.68] okay so back in the lme disease movement
[1045.60 - 1049.20] coming into the 70s and the early 80s
[1047.68 - 1051.20] and this is very important to know don't
[1049.20 - 1054.68] lose this information get a pen get
[1051.20 - 1057.52] paper write this down this is Free by
[1054.68 - 1060.48] the way I could box this up and sell it
[1057.52 - 1063.44] but I want it free for
[1060.48 - 1066.00] everybody back in the Lyme disease era
[1063.44 - 1068.88] okay very important to know what
[1066.00 - 1071.80] happened was people got sick nobody knew
[1068.88 - 1075.40] why they thought it was a tickborne
[1071.80 - 1078.20] illness and then they ran antibiotics
[1075.40 - 1079.64] heavily into women women that already
[1078.20 - 1081.20] had immune system problems and their
[1079.64 - 1082.68] immune systems were breaking down and
[1081.20 - 1086.60] they already were struggling physically
[1082.68 - 1090.00] with their health they nuked them they
[1086.60 - 1093.48] nuked thousands upon thousands of women
[1090.00 - 1095.56] in the 70s and the 80s and the '90s and
[1093.48 - 1098.48] they destroyed their lives they ruined
[1095.56 - 1101.64] their lives they killed many of them off
[1098.48 - 1106.72] they killed thousands of women off by
[1101.64 - 1110.32] nuking them with antibiotics for Lyme
[1106.72 - 1110.32] disease Untold
[1110.56 - 1115.60] damage
[1112.48 - 1117.80] Carnage because of the Lyme disease
[1115.60 - 1119.64] situation where nobody knew why people
[1117.80 - 1121.40] were sick they thought it was the tick
[1119.64 - 1122.96] they thought that's what it was women
[1121.40 - 1124.84] had all these weird symptoms
[1122.96 - 1126.96] neurological symptoms and aches and
[1124.84 - 1129.08] pains and they nuked them and they broke
[1126.96 - 1131.80] their immune systems down and they threw
[1129.08 - 1133.92] these people's lives away there are some
[1131.80 - 1135.76] doctors now that are out there on the
[1133.92 - 1138.44] scene including podcast doctors that
[1135.76 - 1142.08] partook in this very thing in the 80s
[1138.44 - 1142.08] and 90s and have blood on their
[1143.52 - 1148.80] hands now what what happened out of that
[1146.80 - 1152.00] was called the
[1148.80 - 1154.88] herxheimer the die off you guys get
[1152.00 - 1159.52] where I'm going right now the die
[1154.88 - 1162.36] off so another place the detox actually
[1159.52 - 1164.72] was supported through the hygienic
[1162.36 - 1167.44] movement was when
[1164.72 - 1170.04] basically the lime doctors were like
[1167.44 - 1172.40] well I've heard detox my whole career
[1170.04 - 1174.76] I've heard detox from medical clinics
[1172.40 - 1178.16] getting people off of drugs I've heard
[1174.76 - 1180.80] detox through alternative people talking
[1178.16 - 1182.80] about how they're toxic and and they
[1180.80 - 1185.76] need to cleanse and they need to get rid
[1182.80 - 1187.40] of all those toxins so what I think is
[1185.76 - 1189.32] happening to every time I put
[1187.40 - 1190.96] antibiotics in a patient is I think
[1189.32 - 1193.48] they're getting sicker because they're
[1190.96 - 1197.12] having a die
[1193.48 - 1200.20] off so the lme disease World which was
[1197.12 - 1203.56] huge big billions of dollars of Industry
[1200.20 - 1206.84] still is now they were nuking women
[1203.56 - 1209.16] literally day in and day out running
[1206.84 - 1213.04] powerful antibiotics throughout their
[1209.16 - 1215.80] system annihilating their
[1213.04 - 1218.84] bodies and then when women complain and
[1215.80 - 1221.56] said I can't walk no more I can't talk I
[1218.84 - 1224.92] can't think I think I'm dying they would
[1221.56 - 1229.32] say it's die off you're detoxing the
[1224.92 - 1233.28] lime bacteria and it's die off
[1229.32 - 1236.44] so the messages were
[1233.28 - 1239.68] mixed so not only do we have the early
[1236.44 - 1241.80] hygienic detoxification talk from Smog
[1239.68 - 1244.44] and what they said was too much
[1241.80 - 1246.88] meat you also have the conventional
[1244.44 - 1248.96] world with their detoxification talk of
[1246.88 - 1251.60] getting off of morphine and drugs and
[1248.96 - 1254.32] stuff and then you have the Lyme disease
[1251.60 - 1256.60] World saying how this lime bacteria is
[1254.32 - 1258.76] making women sick so when we hit them
[1256.60 - 1260.84] with antibiotics the lime bacteria is
[1258.76 - 1262.84] dying they're going into herxheimer's
[1260.84 - 1264.60] and it's just detox do you guys see
[1262.84 - 1268.76] where I'm going right
[1264.60 - 1271.80] now detox has cursed so many people
[1268.76 - 1275.00] literally cursed them to death you guys
[1271.80 - 1277.44] have no idea what it has done and it has
[1275.00 - 1280.04] destroyed lives from early on back in
[1277.44 - 1283.52] the day all the way till today including
[1280.04 - 1286.24] in Lyme disease and so forth it is the
[1283.52 - 1287.80] curse of the alternative movement and
[1286.24 - 1289.24] hell you might be fine cuz you might not
[1287.80 - 1291.32] be that sick and you're just playing
[1289.24 - 1293.32] around this product and that product and
[1291.32 - 1295.44] you're over here playing around this and
[1293.32 - 1297.92] seite and whatnot and bentonite clay and
[1295.44 - 1300.44] charcoal and sow sweat off your brow and
[1297.92 - 1302.28] then you got some person a woman laying
[1300.44 - 1304.36] in their bed dying because they're
[1302.28 - 1305.92] they're literally dying from like all
[1304.36 - 1308.40] these kinds of other things I'm talking
[1305.92 - 1310.36] about that were inter interwoven into
[1308.40 - 1312.60] the detox talk throughout the whole
[1310.36 - 1315.00] Century that has cursed people and it's
[1312.60 - 1315.00] killing
[1316.52 - 1321.48] people so the lime
[1319.52 - 1325.08] movement
[1321.48 - 1327.80] wasted tens of thousands upon thousands
[1325.08 - 1327.80] of women's
[1328.68 - 1334.32] lives there are thousands of graves with
[1332.40 - 1337.56] women in there that died from being
[1334.32 - 1341.08] bombarded through the lime
[1337.56 - 1343.16] therapies no one gives a
[1341.08 - 1346.28] crap no one
[1343.16 - 1349.92] cares whatever because that's how this
[1346.28 - 1353.76] dirty World Works anyway
[1349.92 - 1355.36] so detox has grown into so many
[1353.76 - 1357.04] different things throughout the course
[1355.36 - 1360.08] of the hundred
[1357.04 - 1361.60] years and the confusion with detox is
[1360.08 - 1365.04] vast
[1361.60 - 1368.08] now so let's go into a little bit
[1365.04 - 1371.00] more as far as Lyme disease goes it was
[1368.08 - 1374.72] the harsh antibiotic usage that was
[1371.00 - 1378.16] eating away at the innards of people
[1374.72 - 1379.96] that caused their symptoms to be worse
[1378.16 - 1382.40] and then it was blamed on herxheimer's
[1379.96 - 1385.72] which was pathogen die
[1382.40 - 1388.04] off and pathogen die off took the hit
[1385.72 - 1390.16] right there that was the excuse and they
[1388.04 - 1394.68] used that into the they packaged it up
[1390.16 - 1397.28] to the detox realm you're just detoxing
[1394.68 - 1401.04] pathogen die off
[1397.28 - 1401.04] right and that's why you're
[1402.56 - 1406.88] suffering so let's go into a little
[1405.72 - 1409.88] deeper on
[1406.88 - 1409.88] this
[1410.36 - 1414.16] the hygienic movement moved into the
[1411.92 - 1416.20] vegan movement the vegan movement still
[1414.16 - 1419.36] believes if you eat
[1416.20 - 1421.96] meat that's why you're
[1419.36 - 1424.32] sick the vegan movement still believes
[1421.96 - 1427.52] that if you eat meat that's why you're
[1424.32 - 1430.00] still sick you ever notice I never took
[1427.52 - 1433.00] a stand either way did you ever notice
[1430.00 - 1435.00] since the Inception of the first book to
[1433.00 - 1437.88] any information I've ever given out
[1435.00 - 1440.32] previous I never said that you know V
[1437.88 - 1443.24] vegan vegan's the only way animal
[1440.32 - 1445.16] protein animal protein's the only way
[1443.24 - 1446.72] cuz it's not about these belief systems
[1445.16 - 1448.48] it's really about what's wrong with a
[1446.72 - 1449.88] person and why they're sick it's one
[1448.48 - 1451.76] size of it's all was never medical
[1449.88 - 1454.88] medium and all that proves
[1451.76 - 1456.88] it but the vegans believe that beef is
[1454.88 - 1458.72] why you were sick and you're toxic and
[1456.88 - 1460.96] you need a detox that's what the vegans
[1458.72 - 1463.08] believed all these years they stemmed it
[1460.96 - 1464.92] off of the hygienic movement originally
[1463.08 - 1466.80] where you were just toxic and you needed
[1464.92 - 1469.64] to
[1466.80 - 1471.52] detox
[1469.64 - 1473.76] let's go into this a little bit deeper
[1471.52 - 1475.64] now I'm going to move the chocolate cake
[1473.76 - 1478.76] over
[1475.64 - 1481.96] okay got a liver and a couple other
[1478.76 - 1481.96] things all
[1483.92 - 1487.16] right you guys I got celery juice right
[1486.16 - 1489.40] here if you don't mind I'm going to take
[1487.16 - 1489.40] another
[1490.12 - 1493.12] sip
[1493.80 - 1498.40] okay singy sweee says over there on
[1496.40 - 1499.92] YouTube is that's the vegan movement I
[1498.40 - 1501.44] guess I'm vegan without following the
[1499.92 - 1503.80] beliefs of the movement I just thought
[1501.44 - 1505.80] it was saving animals a lot of people go
[1503.80 - 1506.60] vegan because they're saving animals
[1505.80 - 1509.64] they
[1506.60 - 1511.24] do but the majority of all vegans
[1509.64 - 1513.64] plant-based people vegans whatever you
[1511.24 - 1516.28] want to call them the majority of all of
[1513.64 - 1519.12] them go plant-based and go vegan because
[1516.28 - 1521.72] they got symptoms and they got sick
[1519.12 - 1524.12] that's why they went that direction
[1521.72 - 1526.36] there's a small small percentage that's
[1524.12 - 1528.24] worried about animals and they stick to
[1526.36 - 1530.32] that that moral grounding and they're
[1528.24 - 1532.40] just like you know animals have souls
[1530.32 - 1534.28] and they don't want to eat animals and
[1532.40 - 1536.84] there's there's a small percentage then
[1534.28 - 1538.60] they go vegan because of that but the
[1536.84 - 1540.88] majority of all of them they go vegan
[1538.60 - 1545.40] because they got sick or a symptom of
[1540.88 - 1548.28] some kind and they went vegan because of
[1545.40 - 1550.76] that so let's get into
[1548.28 - 1552.96] detoxing all
[1550.76 - 1554.60] right people are sick because
[1552.96 - 1559.16] something's making them
[1554.60 - 1561.20] sick meat is not making someone sick
[1559.16 - 1565.48] I'm not pro meat I'm not anti- meat I'm
[1561.20 - 1565.48] just saying meat is not making somebody
[1565.88 - 1571.20] sick Mr Jones eats all the meat he wants
[1568.76 - 1574.92] he's not sick Mrs Jones eats all the
[1571.20 - 1577.16] meat she wants she's sick why is it Mr
[1574.92 - 1579.04] Jones sick Mr Jones is sick what meat's
[1577.16 - 1581.84] making M Jones sick NOP meat's Not
[1579.04 - 1581.84] Making Mr Jones
[1583.16 - 1586.84] sick there's people out there that are
[1585.24 - 1589.04] eating all kinds of crazy stuff they're
[1586.84 - 1591.04] eating all kinds of toxic stuff or what
[1589.04 - 1594.32] you want to call toxic desserts and
[1591.04 - 1596.48] sweets packaged food fried greasy food
[1594.32 - 1599.20] and yeah eventually they'll get sick
[1596.48 - 1600.84] from something and then you got somebody
[1599.20 - 1602.24] who's eating very clean and they're
[1600.84 - 1604.20] eating good and they're eating
[1602.24 - 1606.08] everything that's coming from the best
[1604.20 - 1607.84] farm and they're eating all their fruits
[1606.08 - 1609.72] and vegetables and they're eating what
[1607.84 - 1611.68] whatever and they're sick and they have
[1609.72 - 1613.60] symptoms and they're
[1611.68 - 1615.60] struggling because it's not about
[1613.60 - 1618.16] detoxing it's about what's wrong with
[1615.60 - 1620.60] you what is inside of you what what is
[1618.16 - 1623.44] actually inside of
[1620.60 - 1626.48] you and that's the key that the hygienic
[1623.44 - 1629.20] movement did not know the hygienic
[1626.48 - 1631.44] movement the early hygienic movement
[1629.20 - 1634.12] going all the way into the modern
[1631.44 - 1636.52] hygienic movement did not know people
[1634.12 - 1639.68] were sick because of pathogens just
[1636.52 - 1642.04] literally six seven years ago the
[1639.68 - 1644.16] hygienic people right now today that are
[1642.04 - 1646.24] plant-based still didn't think pathogens
[1644.16 - 1649.32] had anything to do with any there is
[1646.24 - 1652.24] data that I even have saved I could not
[1649.32 - 1654.08] help it because I saw literally people
[1652.24 - 1657.56] that were plant-based in the hygienic
[1654.08 - 1659.32] movement just in 2018 saying how
[1657.56 - 1662.32] pathogens did not
[1659.32 - 1664.32] exist and Epstein bar was a joke and
[1662.32 - 1666.52] does not exist and that you're sick
[1664.32 - 1670.12] because you're toxic that's all you're
[1666.52 - 1673.52] eating too much animal protein it even
[1670.12 - 1677.60] CAU brought us all the way up to 2018
[1673.52 - 1680.20] and 19 and it finally come 2020 when see
[1677.60 - 1683.16] hit town and when SE hit town
[1680.20 - 1686.04] everybody's like viral viral viral viral
[1683.16 - 1688.32] what there's viruses they exist what we
[1686.04 - 1690.36] have to wear masks it's viral and what
[1688.32 - 1692.48] happens is that explosion all of a
[1690.36 - 1695.56] sudden opened up The Floodgate so now
[1692.48 - 1696.96] everybody's like oh yeah EP bar now oh
[1695.56 - 1699.52] oh yeah epen
[1696.96 - 1701.56] bar everybody's like oh oh yeah there's
[1699.52 - 1703.92] bugs there's different bugs shingles
[1701.56 - 1705.56] epine bar there's different bugs oh yeah
[1703.92 - 1708.52] I didn't know the fever blister was a
[1705.56 - 1709.92] virus I had no idea oh my God the fever
[1708.52 - 1711.72] blister you're right I just thought you
[1709.92 - 1713.52] were toxic and the hygienic movement
[1711.72 - 1717.32] believed that a fever blister wasn't
[1713.52 - 1721.72] viral did you know that in the 80s the
[1717.32 - 1724.60] 1990s the 2000s all the way to 2010 even
[1721.72 - 1727.80] past that herpes simplex one was not a
[1724.60 - 1729.20] virus it's believed by the plant-based
[1727.80 - 1731.88] hygienic
[1729.20 - 1734.32] movement and whatever gurus you call in
[1731.88 - 1737.60] those movement believe that it wasn't a
[1734.32 - 1740.20] virus viruses weren't real they weren't
[1737.60 - 1743.64] anything you were just toxic and that's
[1740.20 - 1746.40] where detox is really a poisonous thing
[1743.64 - 1749.28] because it stems from such confusion and
[1746.40 - 1752.20] misinformation from old belief systems
[1749.28 - 1754.72] that still are there and have been
[1752.20 - 1756.68] around I can promise you this if you
[1754.72 - 1759.16] have a fever blister and that sucker's
[1756.68 - 1761.96] popping on your lip and you go and you
[1759.16 - 1764.60] kiss another person there's a very good
[1761.96 - 1766.72] chance that fever blister that virus is
[1764.60 - 1768.92] going to transfer onto that other
[1766.72 - 1771.48] person's and they're going to have the
[1768.92 - 1774.24] herpes simplex sv1 if they didn't
[1771.48 - 1776.20] already have it HSV they're already
[1774.24 - 1778.80] going to have
[1776.20 - 1781.20] it right from that
[1778.80 - 1783.92] kiss if they didn't have it
[1781.20 - 1786.92] before so herpes simplex one herpes
[1783.92 - 1789.28] simplex 2 are real viruses but so are
[1786.92 - 1790.76] all the other viruses too and we can
[1789.28 - 1792.92] catch them and transfer them in the
[1790.76 - 1796.12] whole bit and it can catch up to us we
[1792.92 - 1798.76] can go through our 20s and we can
[1796.12 - 1802.72] actually catch three or four or six or
[1798.76 - 1805.72] seven Epstein bars maybe even 20 Epstein
[1802.72 - 1807.72] bars we can catch they can lay dormant
[1805.72 - 1810.00] inside of us and then as we're heading
[1807.72 - 1811.88] into our 30s our immune system starts to
[1810.00 - 1813.88] lower we're doing things that can
[1811.88 - 1815.84] trigger us maybe we're eating all the
[1813.88 - 1817.44] wrong things that can trigger us meaning
[1815.84 - 1819.24] they lower the immune system a little
[1817.44 - 1822.04] maybe we go into some emotional stress
[1819.24 - 1824.40] or hardship and all of a sudden we get
[1822.04 - 1826.16] the scale tips and now we're sick and
[1824.40 - 1828.04] we're like I don't know what's going on
[1826.16 - 1830.28] my digestion and my floating and I'm
[1828.04 - 1832.84] feeling kind of off and I don't feel
[1830.28 - 1835.32] good overall and something's wrong and
[1832.84 - 1836.84] what's happening is the epscene bar is
[1835.32 - 1839.88] catching
[1836.84 - 1842.84] up the herpy simplex one is catching up
[1839.88 - 1845.04] the cyeg virus is catching up all the
[1842.84 - 1846.96] metals that have been built up in your
[1845.04 - 1848.80] brain and in your body are catching up
[1846.96 - 1851.00] all the chemicals and all the fragrances
[1848.80 - 1854.40] are catching up everything is catching
[1851.00 - 1858.60] up and it's all building up but the
[1854.40 - 1860.60] pathogens are the big one it determines
[1858.60 - 1862.88] if someone is going to be really
[1860.60 - 1865.44] struggling they're going to be bedridden
[1862.88 - 1869.32] brain fogged not feeling
[1865.44 - 1871.40] well the pathogens are going to be that
[1869.32 - 1873.84] determination that's the big one right
[1871.40 - 1876.76] there and the hygienic movement based
[1873.84 - 1879.28] around the detox Theory and the belief
[1876.76 - 1882.16] system that's developed all those years
[1879.28 - 1884.36] doesn't even didn't even believe that a
[1882.16 - 1888.28] virus had anything to do with I was
[1884.36 - 1890.28] talking to guys back a decade ago
[1888.28 - 1892.88] and they were just like aw I just don't
[1890.28 - 1894.92] get it there are no pathogens in the
[1892.88 - 1898.08] vegan in the plant-based hygienic
[1894.92 - 1901.24] movement it's all about detox you just
[1898.08 - 1903.32] need to detox and detox your
[1901.24 - 1907.84] Pathways they were
[1903.32 - 1911.88] lost they were lost now it kills them to
[1907.84 - 1916.16] have to say virus kills them to have to
[1911.88 - 1919.32] utter the word EBV I remember
[1916.16 - 1922.52] distinctly an influencer ripping me
[1919.32 - 1924.76] apart back in 201718 about epine bar
[1922.52 - 1927.16] calling me the epine bar guy ripping me
[1924.76 - 1928.68] apart and he was from the hygienic
[1927.16 - 1930.40] movement belief system didn't even
[1928.68 - 1933.28] believe the Epstein bar meanwhile the
[1930.40 - 1935.84] guy probably had 10 Epstein bars lay
[1933.28 - 1938.84] dormant in
[1935.84 - 1938.84] him
[1942.48 - 1946.60] easy so let's go into detox at another
[1945.16 - 1951.00] level now it's just kind of a little bit
[1946.60 - 1951.00] of an m M school today about
[1955.76 - 1960.16] detoxing
[1957.44 - 1962.56] so do we have to cleanse do we have to
[1960.16 - 1965.36] get rid of poisons and toxins yes but
[1962.56 - 1967.76] they don't take us down they don't make
[1965.36 - 1969.68] us so sick we can't
[1967.76 - 1972.44] function they
[1969.68 - 1974.88] don't unless you're in a clinic because
[1972.44 - 1977.28] you've been taking heroin for a year and
[1974.88 - 1979.16] you're so jacked up on heroin you're so
[1977.28 - 1982.48] jacked up that you're in this clinic and
[1979.16 - 1985.52] you got to go through withdrawal that's
[1982.48 - 1988.48] different that's different if you're
[1985.52 - 1992.28] living your life and you got
[1988.48 - 1993.84] sick detoxification isn't what is giving
[1992.28 - 1996.20] you your
[1993.84 - 1998.00] symptoms I've said it in medical medium
[1996.20 - 1999.32] books and I've said it probably in radio
[1998.00 - 2002.84] shows and so
[1999.32 - 2005.48] forth that if you're highly highly toxic
[2002.84 - 2008.12] and you're really really sensitive that
[2005.48 - 2010.88] yes as you're cleansing you can feel
[2008.12 - 2013.64] malaise a little more tired than
[2010.88 - 2016.40] normal maybe a little
[2013.64 - 2019.52] headachy but you won't get a massive
[2016.40 - 2021.96] eruption of all kinds of rashes you
[2019.52 - 2024.08] won't get like thrown where your legs
[2021.96 - 2026.44] feel like cement and you're bedridden
[2024.08 - 2028.56] you won't get all these ticks and spasms
[2026.44 - 2031.36] and aches and pains and feeling like
[2028.56 - 2033.76] you're literally dying you won't get all
[2031.36 - 2033.76] of
[2034.28 - 2040.44] that and and which leads to this next
[2037.00 - 2040.44] next part here which is really
[2040.56 - 2045.56] important when someone starts to do
[2042.84 - 2048.12] something good for themselves and they
[2045.56 - 2049.76] are and everything seems to be okay and
[2048.12 - 2051.92] they're doing a little celery juice and
[2049.76 - 2053.32] so forth and they're doing okay and all
[2051.92 - 2054.76] of a sudden they get a symptom or they
[2053.32 - 2057.68] don't feel
[2054.76 - 2061.24] good they get
[2057.68 - 2064.36] scared because someone will go you are
[2061.24 - 2068.48] detoxing too fast you have to back up
[2064.36 - 2070.12] and back down and back up out of that
[2068.48 - 2072.96] don't do so much celery juice you're
[2070.12 - 2072.96] going to have to back
[2073.68 - 2080.28] out don't eat so much fruit or or greens
[2077.60 - 2082.92] you're going to have to back
[2080.28 - 2084.60] out somebody might be incorporating and
[2082.92 - 2086.36] bringing some salads with some leafy
[2084.60 - 2088.84] greens they might be doing 8 ounces of
[2086.36 - 2088.84] celery
[2090.48 - 2095.48] juice something's something's up on the
[2092.80 - 2097.48] computer there and they might have they
[2095.48 - 2100.00] might have
[2097.48 - 2101.48] um a little bit of celery juice they
[2100.00 - 2104.12] might be taking care of themselves they
[2101.48 - 2106.00] might be taking out things like things
[2104.12 - 2107.72] that they shouldn't be eating so much of
[2106.00 - 2109.56] they might be removing things they might
[2107.72 - 2112.44] be removing alcohol they might be
[2109.56 - 2114.52] removing stuff out of their diet and
[2112.44 - 2116.16] they're starting to get better and
[2114.52 - 2118.40] starting to feel pretty good and they're
[2116.16 - 2119.80] living their life and four months later
[2118.40 - 2122.16] they start getting a symptom and they
[2119.80 - 2124.48] start getting sick and then they're like
[2122.16 - 2126.92] what's going on I'm doing 8 ounces of
[2124.48 - 2129.20] celery juice I'm doing my leafy green
[2126.92 - 2132.80] salad every day I haven't had fast food
[2129.20 - 2136.20] too often I only had one chocolate dut
[2132.80 - 2138.32] uh last month why am I feeling a symptom
[2136.20 - 2140.32] it's what's wrong and then someone's
[2138.32 - 2142.12] going to say to them on the computer or
[2140.32 - 2143.60] somewhere on the Internet or on social
[2142.12 - 2146.16] and they're going to say you're detoxing
[2143.60 - 2148.80] too heavy you need to stop doing what
[2146.16 - 2150.44] you're doing you need to get more fats
[2148.80 - 2153.16] you need to get more things you want to
[2150.44 - 2154.76] eat in you you're you're you're getting
[2153.16 - 2157.08] emotional cuz you can't eat what you
[2154.76 - 2158.80] want you feel restricted you need a stop
[2157.08 - 2161.08] what you're doing you're detoxing too
[2158.80 - 2162.92] much because you're getting sick cuz
[2161.08 - 2164.56] you're detoxing too much of back off
[2162.92 - 2167.24] back off and then the person goes oh my
[2164.56 - 2169.84] God oh my God I'm scared I'm scared what
[2167.24 - 2171.60] do I do and they're just like okay okay
[2169.84 - 2173.92] just no I'm done with the celery juice
[2171.60 - 2176.24] for now screw that medical medium you
[2173.92 - 2178.00] know guy I'm done with the celery juice
[2176.24 - 2180.88] I'm not going to eat so many leafy green
[2178.00 - 2183.16] salads anymore and you're right let me
[2180.88 - 2185.40] just order a pizza tomorrow and I am
[2183.16 - 2187.72] detoxing too much I need to maybe bring
[2185.40 - 2189.64] in 10 avocados or something let me slow
[2187.72 - 2192.36] down the
[2189.64 - 2194.04] detox but guess what they weren't
[2192.36 - 2196.36] detoxing too much and their symptoms
[2194.04 - 2198.92] weren't from detoxing their symptoms
[2196.36 - 2201.24] were catching up because the bugs in
[2198.92 - 2203.56] them and the problems in them were
[2201.24 - 2205.64] overriding what they were doing what
[2203.56 - 2207.76] they were doing was still not enough and
[2205.64 - 2209.60] it wasn't enough to stop the trajectory
[2207.76 - 2212.08] to change the trajectory of what they
[2209.60 - 2214.56] where they were going to be they were on
[2212.08 - 2217.20] a course of getting sick someday they
[2214.56 - 2219.04] were on that roller coaster ride of
[2217.20 - 2221.16] getting sick someday they were on the
[2219.04 - 2222.80] train heading to the tunnel and on the
[2221.16 - 2225.00] other side of that tunnel they were
[2222.80 - 2227.00] going to be sick and that 8 ounces of
[2225.00 - 2229.12] celery juice was keeping them stable
[2227.00 - 2231.52] enough but guess what they got a little
[2229.12 - 2233.24] too much exposure a few too many bugs
[2231.52 - 2237.36] and they were on the way of getting sick
[2233.24 - 2239.64] no matter what no matter what they were
[2237.36 - 2241.44] getting sick and they were heading into
[2239.64 - 2244.36] that tunnel on that
[2241.44 - 2247.64] train and then somebody with a whole
[2244.36 - 2249.80] detox BS from the Hy genic movement that
[2247.64 - 2252.16] never knew why anyone was sick to begin
[2249.80 - 2254.64] with and on no disrespect there's some
[2252.16 - 2256.64] cool stuff in there like stay away from
[2254.64 - 2258.40] this and that and you know in life and
[2256.64 - 2260.56] stay out of the smog and make sure
[2258.40 - 2262.44] you're getting clean water and clean air
[2260.56 - 2264.56] and make sure you're meditating there's
[2262.44 - 2266.04] nothing wrong with anything like that
[2264.56 - 2267.88] but they didn't know why anybody was
[2266.04 - 2271.00] sick and so then here you are with this
[2267.88 - 2274.00] detox information and you end up saying
[2271.00 - 2277.20] to someone you're detoxing too much stop
[2274.00 - 2279.40] stop red flag red flag whatever you're
[2277.20 - 2282.20] doing you better
[2279.40 - 2285.20] stop and then the person
[2282.20 - 2287.56] stops and then they still get sick and
[2285.20 - 2289.80] still get sicker and still get sicker
[2287.56 - 2291.52] and now their head is screwed up because
[2289.80 - 2293.00] they were doing something good for
[2291.52 - 2295.04] themselves and they were doing something
[2293.00 - 2297.88] that could save them because they were
[2295.04 - 2300.52] going to get sick anyway they were going
[2297.88 - 2303.44] to get sick
[2300.52 - 2308.12] anyway and now it's
[2303.44 - 2310.40] blown you're blowing it all Sky High
[2308.12 - 2310.40] that's
[2312.80 - 2317.60] it what really was going on the person
[2315.76 - 2322.16] was getting sicker and you weren't doing
[2317.60 - 2325.20] enough you were not doing enough to
[2322.16 - 2326.72] Warrant the kind of sickness you had in
[2325.20 - 2330.12] your
[2326.72 - 2332.04] body it wasn't about detoxing and detox
[2330.12 - 2334.64] Pathways or anything like that it was
[2332.04 - 2335.76] about damn you were sick and you got a
[2334.64 - 2337.60] lot of bugs in you and they're
[2335.76 - 2340.96] percolating and you probably got two or
[2337.60 - 2343.12] three epscene bars one shingles one CMV
[2340.96 - 2344.32] and probably a few other things on top
[2343.12 - 2347.88] of that to
[2344.32 - 2349.96] boot and HPV and who knows what else and
[2347.88 - 2351.80] that's what you got going on and on top
[2349.96 - 2353.76] of that you probably had exposures that
[2351.80 - 2356.28] triggered you and lowered your immune
[2353.76 - 2358.20] system instead of stopping you should be
[2356.28 - 2360.92] moving forward even
[2358.20 - 2362.72] more maybe you got a pesticide sprayed
[2360.92 - 2364.80] on you outside you didn't even know it
[2362.72 - 2367.12] they spray them in every Park in every
[2364.80 - 2368.84] roadside they spray them everybody's
[2367.12 - 2372.44] lawn around apartment buildings maybe
[2368.84 - 2375.68] you've had a big drift of pesticides bug
[2372.44 - 2377.92] killer and then a week later you're
[2375.68 - 2380.68] getting showing signs of sickness and
[2377.92 - 2383.20] somebody told you you're detoxing too
[2380.68 - 2385.00] fast you better stop and now you really
[2383.20 - 2387.76] got screwed because you're not going to
[2385.00 - 2387.76] be able to heal
[2390.24 - 2396.04] ever meanwhile what you needed to do was
[2393.68 - 2398.96] not stop you needed to stay with the
[2396.04 - 2402.24] good stuff and you need it
[2398.96 - 2405.56] to move forward even more with
[2402.24 - 2409.64] conviction to heal with faith and
[2405.56 - 2409.64] determination and discipline to
[2413.68 - 2419.60] heal and of course check in with your
[2417.44 - 2421.04] doctors everybody should have a doctor
[2419.60 - 2422.48] everybody should be asking the doctor
[2421.04 - 2425.36] how many times have I held up a medical
[2422.48 - 2426.88] medum book and said bring it to your
[2425.36 - 2428.08] doctor
[2426.88 - 2429.72] and that's what millions of people have
[2428.08 - 2431.08] done over the last decade they brought
[2429.72 - 2433.04] their medical medium books to their
[2431.08 - 2436.32] doctors and a lot of doctors were open
[2433.04 - 2438.48] to it and helpful and were impressed
[2436.32 - 2440.72] with the information and liked what they
[2438.48 - 2440.72] were
[2442.08 - 2447.76] hearing so on the detox front Mass
[2447.92 - 2455.40] confusion some people may be just sick
[2452.00 - 2457.92] and some people may be really really
[2455.40 - 2459.76] sick
[2457.92 - 2463.72] they have old
[2459.76 - 2465.68] Pharmaceuticals that have caused
[2463.72 - 2469.76] damage they've
[2465.68 - 2475.08] had viruses that cause
[2469.76 - 2477.84] damage and when damage is done you can
[2475.08 - 2481.88] be very very
[2477.84 - 2485.24] ill it's not that you're
[2481.88 - 2490.12] detoxing and that's why you're very
[2485.24 - 2492.88] ill no one gets ill
[2490.12 - 2494.36] detoxing nobody just lives their life
[2492.88 - 2496.88] and they're fine and they're just
[2494.36 - 2498.88] playing sports and they're on boats and
[2496.88 - 2501.52] they're having fun in parks and they're
[2498.88 - 2504.56] going out drinking on the weekends with
[2501.52 - 2506.92] friends and having a great time nobody
[2504.56 - 2509.36] gets sick because they're detoxing and
[2506.92 - 2509.36] now they're
[2509.88 - 2514.16] bedridden they're sick because they're
[2512.24 - 2515.60] sick they're sick because they have
[2514.16 - 2517.60] things wrong with them they're sick
[2515.60 - 2518.48] because they're look it with exposures
[2517.60 - 2520.96] and
[2518.48 - 2522.24] pathogens not because they're detoxing
[2520.96 - 2526.36] they're
[2522.24 - 2529.16] sick and guess what guess
[2526.36 - 2531.96] what there are nursing homes with people
[2529.16 - 2536.24] in their 20s and 30s and 40s laying in
[2531.96 - 2539.80] there sick and dying did you know
[2536.24 - 2542.16] that there are parents all around the
[2539.80 - 2545.80] globe with their daughters and their
[2542.16 - 2547.40] sons in infirmaries dying or at home
[2545.80 - 2551.92] dying with
[2547.40 - 2551.92] nurses with nurses they're not
[2552.32 - 2557.24] detoxing people
[2554.48 - 2559.08] with all the same symptoms and
[2557.24 - 2562.60] conditions out there and they're not
[2559.08 - 2564.20] detoxing they're sick they're sick and
[2562.60 - 2568.56] they're in
[2564.20 - 2570.28] beds there are college kids that can't
[2568.56 - 2573.76] finish finish
[2570.28 - 2576.20] college because they became bedridden in

[2576.20 - 2580.00] sophomore year of college and their
[2578.00 - 2584.00] freshman year of college and their home
[2580.00 - 2588.16] with their parents thousands of them
[2584.00 - 2589.60] thousands globally thousands of them
[2588.16 - 2591.44] they can't function anymore they got
[2589.60 - 2593.28] brain fog they got severe crippling
[2591.44 - 2596.96] anxiety they can't even function in the
[2593.28 - 2596.96] world they're home with Mom and
[2597.56 - 2602.00] Dad they can't finish school do you know
[2600.40 - 2603.64] how many women can't finish school they
[2602.00 - 2605.52] can't finish get a college degree
[2603.64 - 2607.44] because by their third year they got so
[2605.52 - 2608.80] fatigued and fog they can't function and
[2607.44 - 2611.48] actually do the
[2608.80 - 2614.32] work and they're home with their parents
[2611.48 - 2618.04] are they detoxing someone tell me are
[2614.32 - 2620.12] they detoxing Janette says in Facebook
[2618.04 - 2622.64] my neighbor just had a daughter pass in
[2620.12 - 2625.32] in this condition there are thousands
[2622.64 - 2628.16] Janette thousands across the globe the
[2625.32 - 2630.16] us alone thousands tens of thousands of
[2628.16 - 2632.12] young women and men that can't finish
[2630.16 - 2634.64] school and college because they're
[2632.12 - 2637.68] bedridden at home with Mom and Dad are
[2634.64 - 2640.56] they detoxing I'm kind of confused I'm
[2637.68 - 2642.72] scratching my head
[2640.56 - 2646.80] here so they're
[2642.72 - 2649.96] detoxing no they're not detoxic they're
[2646.80 - 2653.12] sick and what happens is when we're sick
[2649.96 - 2655.00] we need a plan we need a protocol we
[2653.12 - 2657.68] need to move forward we need to learn we
[2655.00 - 2659.20] need to heal and some as you're doing
[2657.68 - 2663.24] that someone's going to go you're
[2659.20 - 2664.56] detoxing too much you're you're way too
[2663.24 - 2666.40] much and that's why you're sick and all
[2664.56 - 2668.44] of a sudden it blurs the line wait a
[2666.40 - 2670.96] minute was that person ever sick or were
[2668.44 - 2673.32] they detoxing this whole time did they
[2670.96 - 2674.44] ever get sick or were they detoxing this
[2673.32 - 2677.72] whole
[2674.44 - 2679.88] time because the reason why it takes
[2677.72 - 2681.96] long for some people to heal is because
[2679.88 - 2684.36] they were
[2681.96 - 2686.68] injured when someone's liver gets really
[2684.36 - 2689.64] toxic you guys and gets all these
[2686.68 - 2692.76] different things in there like scar
[2689.64 - 2694.60] tissue and tumors and all kinds of
[2692.76 - 2697.36] things inside their
[2694.60 - 2699.48] liver right
[2697.36 - 2703.16] and they got an injured
[2699.48 - 2705.88] liver detoxing isn't the thing that
[2703.16 - 2707.68] fixes it over night the liver's sick and
[2705.88 - 2709.96] it could be sick for a long time while
[2707.68 - 2713.12] the person's healing while the person's
[2709.96 - 2713.12] doing the right stuff to
[2715.88 - 2719.96] heal it's a lot of confusion with
[2718.08 - 2722.04] detoxing and it's sad because it's
[2719.96 - 2724.48] growing out there I watched it years ago
[2722.04 - 2726.84] and I saw what was happening years ago
[2724.48 - 2730.12] and it stems from a few individuals now
[2726.84 - 2732.44] too in the health movement that built
[2730.12 - 2736.52] their business off of detox you hear
[2732.44 - 2738.28] that business you hear that they
[2736.52 - 2744.80] business
[2738.28 - 2747.40] right do I sell a detoxing business no I
[2744.80 - 2750.00] don't but there's a few individuals in
[2747.40 - 2753.52] the health realm health professionals
[2750.00 - 2757.20] that's been selling for years detoxing
[2753.52 - 2759.12] businesses get it convincing people that
[2757.20 - 2762.08] they're detoxing so they can take all
[2759.12 - 2764.28] their alcohol herbal tinctures and such
[2762.08 - 2767.16] and forth right they can take all those
[2764.28 - 2770.80] things and that's been keeping the whole
[2767.16 - 2772.76] detox fear and Chaos alive the detox
[2770.80 - 2775.64] curse it's been haunting everybody for
[2772.76 - 2775.64] over a hundred
[2776.00 - 2781.48] years and that detox curse that thing's
[2779.84 - 2783.64] evil because I'll tell you right now
[2781.48 - 2787.60] it'll send somebody just out of healing
[2783.64 - 2790.48] in in a day in a minute
[2787.60 - 2792.36] because we lose faith we get insecure we
[2790.48 - 2795.96] lose confidence and all you have to hear
[2792.36 - 2797.76] is someone say it's really detox that's
[2795.96 - 2799.40] why you're like this and then you forget
[2797.76 - 2801.84] why you even got sick you didn't even
[2799.40 - 2806.28] know like how did I even get sick was it
[2801.84 - 2806.28] detox this whole time it's so
[2810.72 - 2817.80] confusing so let's go into this part if
[2813.80 - 2817.80] you got sick something
[2818.28 - 2824.84] busted you're really
[2820.64 - 2829.24] ill something got
[2824.84 - 2829.24] broken pathogens tend to do
[2831.04 - 2836.32] something pathogens tend to do something
[2833.84 - 2839.96] that's what they do
[2836.32 - 2839.96] okay so here's a
[2843.24 - 2849.44] nerve okay there's another nerve
[2846.32 - 2852.12] these are nerves it's another
[2849.44 - 2856.12] nerve some nerves down here in the lower
[2852.12 - 2856.12] part of your body see these
[2857.68 - 2862.60] nerves
[2859.40 - 2865.64] nerves all right when the nerves get
[2862.60 - 2868.72] damaged by
[2865.64 - 2870.04] pathogens they're injured healing
[2868.72 - 2872.96] doesn't happen
[2870.04 - 2876.96] overnight so when there's a
[2872.96 - 2880.32] pathogen in your body and that that
[2876.96 - 2882.12] pathogen eats away at a nerve that's why
[2880.32 - 2884.04] people get
[2882.12 - 2887.32] sick
[2884.04 - 2888.76] okay what happens is put some pathogens
[2887.32 - 2891.44] on the nerves you see this I'll put them
[2888.76 - 2892.96] on the nerves what happens is that you
[2891.44 - 2894.92] don't heal
[2892.96 - 2896.96] fast maybe you're somebody and you
[2894.92 - 2899.20] didn't get that sick yet maybe your
[2896.96 - 2901.52] trajectory wasn't going to get that sick
[2899.20 - 2903.88] maybe you have a mild upstein bar one
[2901.52 - 2906.08] that just caused mono at one point and
[2903.88 - 2907.76] then it's been kind of docile causing
[2906.08 - 2909.48] other symptoms as you go along and then
[2907.76 - 2911.76] you get the thyroid the hypothyroidism
[2909.48 - 2913.40] from your mono virus theep seen bar and
[2911.76 - 2914.72] you're not really that sick yet and
[2913.40 - 2915.96] you're living your life and you're doing
[2914.72 - 2917.20] your appointments and you're going
[2915.96 - 2918.72] everywhere and you're driving around and
[2917.20 - 2920.04] you're picking up your coffee and you're
[2918.72 - 2921.64] getting a massage and whatever else
[2920.04 - 2923.92] you're doing living your life going to
[2921.64 - 2925.36] meditation going here there and you're
[2923.92 - 2927.40] not that sick yet but you could be
[2925.36 - 2929.68] somebody where those bugs were a lot
[2927.40 - 2932.12] stronger more potent more
[2929.68 - 2933.92] powerful and your immune system was
[2932.12 - 2935.60] triggered enough it was beaten down with
[2933.92 - 2937.24] some chemical exposure maybe some far
[2935.60 - 2939.52] pharmaceutical exposure knock down your
[2937.24 - 2942.52] immune system more very important point
[2939.52 - 2945.32] you guys and then the bugs took off a
[2942.52 - 2948.52] little bit too much and they damaged the
[2945.32 - 2952.24] nerves nerve
[2948.52 - 2954.88] damage okay
[2952.24 - 2956.76] damage the nerves take time to heal they
[2954.88 - 2959.20] may not heal in a month they may not
[2956.76 - 2961.48] heal in six months but what happens is
[2959.20 - 2965.32] someone can come along and be
[2961.48 - 2967.80] like you're detoxing way too much that's
[2965.32 - 2969.36] why you're sitting there sick no you're
[2967.80 - 2972.52] sitting there
[2969.36 - 2975.08] sick because you got nerve damage and
[2972.52 - 2977.92] nerve damage takes time to
[2975.08 - 2981.20] heal could take
[2977.92 - 2983.52] years couple of years three years four
[2981.20 - 2985.08] years for some people if they have the
[2983.52 - 2986.84] right resources and the right things
[2985.08 - 2989.04] that they're doing it could take a few
[2986.84 - 2991.92] good years and then they can start
[2989.04 - 2993.52] coming back somebody with severe fatigue
[2991.92 - 2995.08] somebody with that was diagnosed with
[2993.52 - 2997.96] multiple sclerosis somebody that was
[2995.08 - 2999.32] diagnosed with ALS somebody that that
[2997.96 - 3001.56] just had a lot of different Tinkles
[2999.32 - 3003.64] numbness weakness of the limbs somebody
[3001.56 - 3006.60] that just had crippling anxiety but the
[3003.64 - 3010.08] nerves that get damage need time to heal
[3006.60 - 3012.32] and when they start to heal you come
[3010.08 - 3014.52] back but if you don't get that
[3012.32 - 3017.64] opportunity to come back because
[3014.52 - 3020.28] somebody said oh you're detoxing
[3017.64 - 3022.56] detoxing stop what you're doing it's
[3020.28 - 3024.68] killing you the
[3022.56 - 3027.40] detoxing without that good stuff you
[3024.68 - 3029.72] were doing God knows where you would be
[3027.40 - 3031.76] I've seen this with hundreds of people
[3029.72 - 3033.08] over the years God knows where you'd be
[3031.76 - 3036.76] if you weren't doing the good stuff
[3033.08 - 3039.40] you're doing but it could be blown Sky
[3036.76 - 3041.24] High because we can easily poison
[3039.40 - 3042.96] somebody with the detox talk I've seen
[3041.24 - 3045.36] it happened for years it stems from the
[3042.96 - 3047.04] hygienic movement it's been around and
[3045.36 - 3048.72] that hygienic movement never knew why
[3047.04 - 3050.60] anybody was sick I can tell you right
[3048.72 - 3053.04] now going back 20 years ago and I'm not
[3050.60 - 3055.28] going to name the
[3053.04 - 3057.04] clinics but I've been friends with many
[3055.28 - 3059.60] of of the people that have run and
[3057.04 - 3062.60] operated clinics throughout the years
[3059.60 - 3064.48] healing clinics and they didn't even
[3062.60 - 3066.88] know there was anything else but detox
[3064.48 - 3068.80] and they had no idea pathogens caused
[3066.88 - 3071.44] any illness whatsoever I used to get
[3068.80 - 3074.24] into debates all the time with like
[3071.44 - 3076.12] literally directors of clinics where
[3074.24 - 3078.52] they'd be like Anthony it's really just
[3076.12 - 3080.84] toxins we do this you go into the sauna
[3078.52 - 3082.88] here and then from the SAA you go into
[3080.84 - 3085.00] this and then you go do this we have all
[3082.88 - 3087.60] the weat grass here and I'd be like yeah
[3085.00 - 3089.48] but there suffering with different
[3087.60 - 3091.76] things inside their body like the
[3089.48 - 3094.84] pathogens and the hygienic movement with
[3091.76 - 3096.36] their detox BS talk has really caused a
[3094.84 - 3098.44] lot of problems with people out there
[3096.36 - 3100.76] and a lot of times people don't know
[3098.44 - 3103.20] what they really even feel like when
[3100.76 - 3105.40] they're on stimulants so people are on
[3103.20 - 3107.24] so many stimulants out there in general
[3105.40 - 3109.08] that when you remove all the stimulants
[3107.24 - 3113.12] then you feel what you really feel which
[3109.08 - 3114.88] is dragging and fatigued and tired and
[3113.12 - 3116.04] that's a whole another level and when
[3114.88 - 3117.88] you go to at that point you're going to
[3116.04 - 3120.20] think you're detoxing too
[3117.88 - 3122.36] much when you get off of stimul
[3120.20 - 3123.96] stimulants people they get off their
[3122.36 - 3125.92] they get off their adol they get off
[3123.96 - 3128.68] their coffee they get off all their
[3125.92 - 3130.28] stimulants right and they're they're off
[3128.68 - 3131.76] their chocolate they're off the all the
[3130.28 - 3134.16] different stimulants next to you know it
[3131.76 - 3136.44] they're dragging and the depression
[3134.16 - 3138.44] starts to creep up they get off all
[3136.44 - 3140.56] their super fatty foods and their
[3138.44 - 3142.40] stimulants and all of a sudden their
[3140.56 - 3144.88] their depression starts to creep up and
[3142.40 - 3146.80] they start feeling like something's
[3144.88 - 3148.96] wrong and they're thinking I'm detoxing
[3146.80 - 3151.84] no you're not detoxing dude you're not
[3148.96 - 3154.00] detoxing you're just you were that sick
[3151.84 - 3155.48] you just weren't super sick but you were
[3154.00 - 3157.64] sick enough where when you got rid of
[3155.48 - 3160.76] your stimulants it showcased it it
[3157.64 - 3163.04] exhibited it they feel they felt what
[3160.76 - 3165.28] their body really had going on and what
[3163.04 - 3167.36] was really going on inside their body
[3165.28 - 3170.00] their pathogens and their metals and
[3167.36 - 3171.84] their old Pharmaceuticals and things
[3170.00 - 3173.96] that were in there that have done damage
[3171.84 - 3177.72] to nerves in their body and the
[3173.96 - 3177.72] stimulants were Mass asking
[3178.52 - 3186.48] it healing takes time when we've been
[3183.80 - 3188.52] injured when something has injured our
[3186.48 - 3192.64] nervous system our brain stem our
[3188.52 - 3194.12] cranial nerves our Vagas nerves our
[3192.64 - 3198.60] frenic
[3194.12 - 3198.60] nerves when things injure these
[3198.76 - 3204.28] things it takes time to
[3201.76 - 3209.72] heal and then when somebody throws that
[3204.28 - 3213.04] big old world word on everything you're
[3209.72 - 3213.04] detoxing it's
[3213.96 - 3217.76] detox person just got
[3226.00 - 3231.08] screwed no disrespect to anybody or
[3228.76 - 3232.40] anything any belief system out there or
[3231.08 - 3235.80] anything like
[3232.40 - 3237.32] that it's not about that
[3235.80 - 3239.72] I'm just trying to give you guys the
[3237.32 - 3241.56] history you come into this four years
[3239.72 - 3245.04] ago two years ago there's influencers
[3241.56 - 3246.92] right now that are shouting out on IG
[3245.04 - 3249.68] talking so much crap that just got into
[3246.92 - 3251.56] hell two years ago all they knew was cut
[3249.68 - 3254.48] the carbs and eat more
[3251.56 - 3256.72] protein that's all they knew stop eating
[3254.48 - 3258.44] fried greasy food start working out more
[3256.72 - 3260.84] and you're 22 years old you can just go
[3258.44 - 3263.28] on Instagram and show how good you look
[3260.84 - 3265.44] and how good you're doing and you don't
[3263.28 - 3268.44] know a thing about what happened in
[3265.44 - 3270.44] history and what is even going on and so
[3268.44 - 3273.04] when you even utter detox pathway you
[3270.44 - 3275.72] have no idea with anything about
[3273.04 - 3279.60] it cold Whit spring says but doesn't
[3275.72 - 3281.56] eczema and acne often get worse when you
[3279.60 - 3285.00] start
[3281.56 - 3289.28] detoxing what happens with eczema and
[3285.00 - 3291.64] acne is a few things okay it Cycles
[3289.28 - 3294.08] people with eczema and acne already
[3291.64 - 3297.60] cycle into worse and less
[3294.08 - 3299.48] worse ask anybody who has severe
[3297.60 - 3302.52] eczema
[3299.48 - 3304.76] may there's times where it cycles and
[3302.52 - 3308.64] it's debilitating and then they come out
[3304.76 - 3312.32] of the cycle okay they're already going
[3308.64 - 3315.76] through the natural process of the bugs
[3312.32 - 3318.48] moving up in strength lowering down in
[3315.76 - 3321.12] strength moving up in strength lowering
[3318.48 - 3324.00] down in strength and when it comes down
[3321.12 - 3327.88] ex psoriasis you're going to see that
[3324.00 - 3329.72] waiver but you're not going to see them
[3327.88 - 3333.04] bedridden
[3329.72 - 3335.76] may you know what I mean or tick and
[3333.04 - 3337.36] spasms getting worse or anything else
[3335.76 - 3340.28] happening to that
[3337.36 - 3343.52] degree and if someone was pumped up with
[3340.28 - 3346.40] steroids for a very long
[3343.52 - 3348.48] time that's another thing that's very
[3346.40 - 3350.76] difficult on their body's immune system
[3348.48 - 3353.44] so it's coming off of all the steroids
[3350.76 - 3357.48] and the steroids that are inside the
[3353.44 - 3360.72] liver that plays a role with the immune
[3357.48 - 3362.28] system because the the steroids hold
[3360.72 - 3364.44] back the immune system's initial
[3362.28 - 3366.32] reaction of exen psoriasis understand
[3364.44 - 3368.20] that that's important to know that means
[3366.32 - 3370.16] without the steroids their examen
[3368.20 - 3373.28] psoriasis would be that
[3370.16 - 3376.08] bad it would be out of control in in in
[3373.28 - 3378.60] in the the probably the greatest
[3376.08 - 3380.32] sense so it's a combination when you're
[3378.60 - 3383.92] talking about ex psoriasis in serious
[3380.32 - 3387.80] cases you're talking about the steroid
[3383.92 - 3389.84] process combined very difficult because
[3387.80 - 3393.56] the steroid the steroid process was
[3389.84 - 3396.24] hiding and masking how bad the xamis was
[3393.56 - 3398.92] so when people go off the steroids the
[3396.24 - 3403.52] eczema is showcasing what it really
[3398.92 - 3405.48] should be and that can be blamed on
[3403.52 - 3407.80] detox like if you're doing something
[3405.48 - 3407.80] good for
[3408.40 - 3412.68] yourself but it's a really good question
[3410.44 - 3414.40] when it comes down to eimos psoriasis
[3412.68 - 3416.96] almost everybody with severe exmos
[3414.40 - 3419.92] psoriasis goes on some type of biologic
[3416.96 - 3423.32] some type of some type of steroid or so
[3419.92 - 3426.28] forth and bend down that road and that's
[3423.32 - 3428.56] controlling and masking the ecoman
[3426.28 - 3431.80] psoriasis so once you start coming off
[3428.56 - 3436.36] of that it just blows up because it was
[3431.80 - 3440.32] hiding it was suppressing it right so
[3436.36 - 3440.32] that's kind of another a whole another
[3440.44 - 3446.28] angle and a lot of people it's cyclical
[3444.20 - 3448.08] right with x this even when they're not
[3446.28 - 3450.60] on steroids or anything like that it's
[3448.08 - 3453.52] ebbing and flowing it's
[3450.60 - 3456.24] awful two months later they come out
[3453.52 - 3457.88] it's getting Level again who it's awful
[3456.24 - 3460.92] two months later they're coming out with
[3457.88 - 3461.92] it right so if you do any one thing
[3460.92 - 3463.52] you're not even going to know what's
[3461.92 - 3464.84] causing it at the time because you're
[3463.52 - 3466.60] not going to sure you're not going to
[3464.84 - 3468.28] even know where you are cyclical wise
[3466.60 - 3470.12] where's the cycle where where are you
[3468.28 - 3472.24] even are you a month away from it
[3470.12 - 3473.68] getting worse like it usually does or
[3472.24 - 3475.80] are you two months from it getting
[3473.68 - 3477.56] better it it's that's another thing all
[3475.80 - 3479.44] on its own but I I'll go into more
[3477.56 - 3481.28] detail about exus rasis and cover
[3479.44 - 3483.96] everything so so there's no
[3481.28 - 3485.84] confusion Le over there on IG says aw
[3483.96 - 3488.00] can you please explain why people with
[3485.84 - 3491.08] thyroid adrenal issues struggle to let
[3488.00 - 3491.08] go of
[3491.16 - 3495.48] fat first of all when we let go of fat
[3493.64 - 3498.32] we usually underc calorie
[3495.48 - 3499.96] ourselves and Fat's a stimulant too so I
[3498.32 - 3502.96] want to give you something little little
[3499.96 - 3505.12] talk about this okay if you're on a ton
[3502.96 - 3506.56] of avocado and you're on a ton of to and
[3505.12 - 3508.20] you're on a ton of olive oil and you're
[3506.56 - 3510.88] on a ton of olives and you're on a ton
[3508.20 - 3513.00] of meat and you're on you know beef and
[3510.88 - 3515.00] you're on a ton of chicken and you're
[3513.00 - 3516.52] getting fat from all kinds of chocolate
[3515.00 - 3519.72] and so forth and you're on lots of
[3516.52 - 3521.72] chocolate and everything um what happens
[3519.72 - 3523.56] is it stimulates and it causes your
[3521.72 - 3525.00] adrenals to release adrenaline all the
[3523.56 - 3527.68] time so you're releasing all this
[3525.00 - 3531.56] adrenaline so when you come off of fat
[3527.68 - 3534.08] your adrenals start to relax and then
[3531.56 - 3536.08] the ad the adrenaline addiction starts
[3534.08 - 3539.08] you start to feel the adrenaline
[3536.08 - 3541.32] addiction the reason why people are so
[3539.08 - 3543.68] so hog heavy into getting addicted to
[3541.32 - 3545.32] fats to such a degree where they're
[3543.68 - 3547.12] eating so much fat and everything they
[3545.32 - 3548.52] have to have fat in their food they have
[3547.12 - 3550.24] to have cheese they have to have all
[3548.52 - 3552.00] kinds of things that are like fatty no
[3550.24 - 3553.88] one wants eat a green salad that doesn't
[3552.00 - 3556.80] have cheese or cheese you know squares
[3553.88 - 3559.80] in it or you know something tuna in
[3556.80 - 3562.48] there egg cheese right because they're
[3559.80 - 3564.72] getting all that fat it's all this fat
[3562.48 - 3566.36] because what that does is it stimulates
[3564.72 - 3567.84] the adrenals and it makes them feel good
[3566.36 - 3570.68] because they're high on adrenaline
[3567.84 - 3572.84] because the adrenaline has to it has to
[3570.68 - 3574.72] thin out the blood so the fats don't
[3572.84 - 3576.60] cause a problem with your brain so it
[3574.72 - 3579.12] has to thin out the
[3576.60 - 3580.36] blood so once you come off all that fat
[3579.12 - 3582.56] you're going to feel tired you're going
[3580.36 - 3584.16] to feel where you used to be kind where
[3582.56 - 3586.92] you sorry you're going to feel where you
[3584.16 - 3589.32] should feel because that's really what
[3586.92 - 3591.76] you feel like so the minute you come off
[3589.32 - 3595.12] a stimulant like high fat which is
[3591.76 - 3597.84] stimulant you end up feeling whoa this
[3595.12 - 3599.84] is what I felt like it's a different
[3597.84 - 3601.76] feeling same thing when you come off of
[3599.84 - 3603.68] coffee and then you're now coffee free
[3601.76 - 3606.20] you're like whoa this is what I used to
[3603.68 - 3607.60] feel like or or without coffee same
[3606.20 - 3609.44] thing you come off of like chocolate and
[3607.60 - 3612.12] so
[3609.44 - 3614.04] forth me over there on YouTube says what
[3612.12 - 3615.16] about debilitating reactions to Healing
[3614.04 - 3618.64] Foods
[3615.16 - 3621.96] aw mean like food sensitivities and so
[3618.64 - 3623.92] forth um what happens is that that's a
[3621.96 - 3626.36] whole another thing I'll do a show on
[3623.92 - 3629.16] that because I I want to do that
[3626.36 - 3631.44] Justice I read the question because I
[3629.16 - 3632.56] want to make sure I do a show on that
[3631.44 - 3634.60] that's really cool because that goes
[3632.56 - 3637.16] into food sensitivities and chemical
[3634.60 - 3639.72] sensitivities and we need to show on all
[3637.16 - 3639.72] of that
[3641.00 - 3644.84] combined so back to
[3647.68 - 3653.36] detoxing we have to be cautious to how
[3650.00 - 3655.08] we see detoxing and understand it I'm
[3653.36 - 3657.04] hoping this information that I gave you
[3655.08 - 3660.12] today gives you a little bit of a window
[3657.04 - 3663.60] into where it derived from why it's
[3660.12 - 3666.92] still here why It's haunting
[3663.60 - 3669.84] people one thing detox does is it gives
[3666.92 - 3672.24] the practitioner a way
[3669.84 - 3674.64] out it gives the health coach and
[3672.24 - 3677.36] practitioner a way out you're not doing
[3674.64 - 3679.96] better I have you on charcoal and
[3677.36 - 3682.32] bentonite clay and pearl powder I have
[3679.96 - 3684.88] you on sodium bicarbonate I have you on
[3682.32 - 3688.44] dious Earth particles I have you on
[3684.88 - 3691.16] alkaline ionizer water from kangaroo I
[3688.44 - 3694.48] got you on all this stuff and you're not
[3691.16 - 3696.92] feeling better um I'm a failure as a
[3694.48 - 3699.52] practitioner as a health coach as a
[3696.92 - 3701.44] doctor you're detoxing that's what it is
[3699.52 - 3702.64] you're detoxing I read something about
[3701.44 - 3706.04] it you're
[3702.64 - 3707.64] detoxing it's also the way out I've
[3706.04 - 3710.12] watched it be the way out for all the
[3707.64 - 3712.16] lime doctors for many years I watched it
[3710.12 - 3714.76] be the lot way out well no wait you're
[3712.16 - 3717.48] just detoxing die off you're just just
[3714.76 - 3719.68] detoxing in general that's why you're
[3717.48 - 3724.64] getting worse and worse it's not
[3719.68 - 3724.64] the doxy that I've been pumping in
[3724.96 - 3733.52] you oh I just put whoa 10,000 milligrams
[3730.40 - 3736.48] of doxy in you every single day for six
[3733.52 - 3739.72] months oops it's not that that did it no
[3736.48 - 3742.20] you're detoxing it's been the way out
[3739.72 - 3744.64] it's this it's just it's been
[3742.20 - 3745.96] weaponized so there's hundred and
[3744.64 - 3747.80] hundreds and hundreds of health coaches
[3745.96 - 3749.56] now thousands of them just spawning out
[3747.80 - 3751.12] everywhere just boom and there's all
[3749.56 - 3752.20] these people and they get people in
[3751.12 - 3754.20] there and they're just like I don't know
[3752.20 - 3756.08] what's wrong with these people I'm just
[3754.20 - 3757.84] kind of going by the keto diet or going
[3756.08 - 3759.68] by this and whatnot I'm trying to health
[3757.84 - 3761.48] coach them and then you see them getting
[3759.68 - 3763.24] sick and the person who's a client paid
[3761.48 - 3766.36] money so they paid whatever they paid
[3763.24 - 3769.00] $150 to $300 $500 and they paid this
[3766.36 - 3771.64] money to talk to the health coach and a
[3769.00 - 3774.64] health coach is like I think you're
[3771.64 - 3776.36] detoxing that's what it is so so we got
[3774.64 - 3778.60] to kind of like figure this out cuz
[3776.36 - 3781.24] you're detox detoxing has been the way
[3778.60 - 3783.16] out for also the practitioner now and
[3781.24 - 3785.36] for the person who's a health coach it's
[3783.16 - 3787.04] another reason why it's exploding out
[3785.36 - 3789.72] there because people don't know why
[3787.04 - 3791.72] somebody's sick they just don't have a
[3789.72 - 3793.32] clue right all these people they're all
[3791.72 - 3794.40] sick out there they go to the doctors
[3793.32 - 3796.60] they're not happy with what their
[3794.40 - 3798.04] doctors are telling them um and then
[3796.60 - 3799.28] they go and they look for health coaches
[3798.04 - 3800.52] and they're going to do that and they go
[3799.28 - 3801.80] take they go to courses and they're
[3800.52 - 3803.96] buying all these courses they're like
[3801.80 - 3806.80] I'm sick I need to get better and then
[3803.96 - 3809.16] they get like a moment with the guru of
[3806.80 - 3812.48] the course or Guru of the coach or
[3809.16 - 3815.16] whatever it is and the coach is like um
[3812.48 - 3818.24] you're detoxing too
[3815.16 - 3821.44] much that's another reason why it's
[3818.24 - 3824.92] exploding Katrina says I confirm I had
[3821.44 - 3827.96] severe psoriasis it comes in waves with
[3824.92 - 3830.92] waves worse and better but in general it
[3827.96 - 3833.52] became much better
[3830.92 - 3836.88] on it became much better on my head
[3833.52 - 3839.76] especially almost everything gone
[3836.88 - 3839.76] Amazing do an
[3841.36 - 3846.12] mm I think this is a big point right
[3843.88 - 3849.00] here that people don't know too is H
[3846.12 - 3852.48] there's another one you guys um ivy
[3849.00 - 3855.80] flower says on IG can we get the
[3852.48 - 3858.64] shakes when neurotoxins have the body
[3855.80 - 3860.76] leave the body I shake and my teeth
[3858.64 - 3864.68] chatter sometimes on the
[3860.76 - 3866.72] hmds but then I feel so much better what
[3864.68 - 3869.28] happens is when people's nervous systems
[3866.72 - 3870.80] weaken and they're
[3869.28 - 3874.12] struggling
[3870.80 - 3877.92] okay anything that takes
[3874.12 - 3881.68] digestion anything that takes
[3877.92 - 3884.52] digestion could actually triggle trigger
[3881.68 - 3887.68] mild symptoms keep this in
[3884.52 - 3890.40] mind anything that triggers I'm going to
[3887.68 - 3890.40] get a better white
[3892.80 - 3896.80] board so everything that
[3897.32 - 3902.12] triggers so can happen so say you got
[3899.80 - 3905.12] some nerves right so we're going to do a
[3902.12 - 3905.12] nice vegus nerve
[3908.08 - 3912.08] here now there's two Vegas nerves that
[3910.36 - 3914.24] come out of the
[3912.08 - 3917.20] cranial the brain
[3914.24 - 3919.36] stem okay we'll do some frenic nerves
[3917.20 - 3922.40] again let's do some frenic
[3919.36 - 3924.60] nerves I'm such an
[3922.40 - 3926.48] artist all right
[3924.60 - 3930.60] do some other nerves
[3926.48 - 3932.48] here okay all right when we have a lot
[3930.60 - 3934.16] of neurotoxins Right medical mem
[3932.48 - 3935.88] information viruses that create
[3934.16 - 3938.04] neurotoxins and neurotoxins are swimming
[3935.88 - 3940.72] around in our body they're already
[3938.04 - 3944.08] putting a damper on the nervous system
[3940.72 - 3946.16] so the neurotoxins are already beating
[3944.08 - 3947.92] down the nervous system okay so your
[3946.16 - 3949.88] neur neurotoxins right this is
[3947.92 - 3951.52] neurotoxins coming down on the nerves
[3949.88 - 3956.32] neurotoxins coming down on the nerves
[3951.52 - 3958.32] right these neurotoxins already hamper
[3956.32 - 3961.96] hamper the nerves the vag nerves the
[3958.32 - 3964.28] frenic nerves already hamper them so any
[3961.96 - 3967.04] time you
[3964.28 - 3969.36] eat you're going to feel it not every
[3967.04 - 3972.08] time but most of the time depending on
[3969.36 - 3974.48] what time of day you're going to have
[3972.08 - 3977.20] low spots with your nervous system at
[3974.48 - 3979.48] different times of the day this is why
[3977.20 - 3982.36] adrenal snacks and medical medium does
[3979.48 - 3984.76] not do intermittent fasting this is why
[3982.36 - 3987.48] medical medium information does not
[3984.76 - 3990.44] withhold food from people this is why
[3987.48 - 3992.44] it's not restrictive because you need to
[3990.44 - 3994.24] get enough calories in and you need to
[3992.44 - 3996.92] get enough snacks and stuff throughout
[3994.24 - 3999.04] the day because you want to keep the the
[3996.92 - 4001.08] the playing field level you want to keep
[3999.04 - 4003.72] the homeostasis you guys and that
[4001.08 - 4006.60] homeostasis protects you so you have
[4003.72 - 4009.40] less ups and downs with a nervous system
[4006.60 - 4009.40] that's already
[4009.88 - 4016.24] hampered but you
[4012.12 - 4020.00] eat anything depends on what time of day
[4016.24 - 4020.00] it can play a role on the nervous
[4020.08 - 4023.92] system because the nervous systems
[4021.96 - 4026.24] already weak and
[4023.92 - 4028.68] hampered takes time to
[4026.24 - 4032.36] heal but if someone said well you're
[4028.68 - 4034.64] detoxing better stop the hmd better stop
[4032.36 - 4036.96] the heavy metal detox you're
[4034.64 - 4039.32] detoxing and you get scared you stop the
[4036.96 - 4040.72] hmd you stop your celery juice you stop
[4039.32 - 4042.72] whatever medical mem tools there's
[4040.72 - 4044.84] dozens and dozens dozens of them and you
[4042.72 - 4047.40] stop them and now you're like what what
[4044.84 - 4047.40] do I do
[4053.08 - 4059.04] now anyway guys this concludes the first
[4056.00 - 4060.36] round of detox talk we are going to do
[4059.04 - 4061.60] it again sometime but I think I'm going
[4060.36 - 4062.48] to talk a little bit more if you got
[4061.60 - 4066.24] another
[4062.48 - 4066.24] minute let's talk about new
[4067.48 - 4073.12] exposures so your
[4070.36 - 4075.36] gut your gut can be filled with a lot of
[4073.12 - 4077.92] different stuff it can be filled with
[4075.36 - 4080.56] old rancid fat that's sitting inside the
[4077.92 - 4083.60] gut Linings it can be cut with
[4080.56 - 4086.00] undigested protein sitting in the gut
[4083.60 - 4089.48] Linings and it's all building up in
[4086.00 - 4091.08] there right our guts can get toxic it
[4089.48 - 4092.60] can get filled with chemicals and all
[4091.08 - 4094.20] kinds of metals and everything else in
[4092.60 - 4098.16] there and all this kind of
[4094.20 - 4101.92] stuff okay and we can still not be
[4098.16 - 4104.04] sick we can have a gut full of garbage
[4101.92 - 4106.48] there are guys walking out there and
[4104.04 - 4109.04] they got a gut out to here and it's hard
[4106.48 - 4111.68] as a rock and you can you can literally
[4109.04 - 4114.12] punch it like boom boom boom and it's
[4111.68 - 4116.24] not going to actually even budge and you
[4114.12 - 4118.48] can punch it and that gut's going to
[4116.24 - 4121.52] just sit there like a big like rubber
[4118.48 - 4123.40] ball inside the guy's gut right and the
[4121.52 - 4125.44] guy's like fine he's like I go to work
[4123.40 - 4126.92] every day there's nothing wrong with me
[4125.44 - 4128.80] yeah the doctor says I need to lower my
[4126.92 - 4130.92] cholesterol the doctor says he's worried
[4128.80 - 4133.52] about my A1C he doesn't want me to get
[4130.92 - 4135.88] type two diabetes but overall I'm doing
[4133.52 - 4138.12] pretty pretty good I feel good and the
[4135.88 - 4141.20] guy's gut is filled with [ __ ] tons of
[4138.12 - 4143.80] [ __ ] and garbage
[4141.20 - 4145.36] right somebody else doesn't has very
[4143.80 - 4148.00] little of that in here they're eating
[4145.36 - 4151.40] clean they're doing good a lot but it
[4148.00 - 4153.44] also depends on exposures but if that
[4151.40 - 4155.16] guy that has that hard gut that's filled
[4153.44 - 4156.32] with all that garbage in there gets a
[4155.16 - 4159.12] real
[4156.32 - 4162.08] exposure picks up a bug something
[4159.12 - 4165.16] happens could go down and it all comes
[4162.08 - 4167.44] crumbling down and people who are also
[4165.16 - 4169.80] taking care of themselves can also get
[4167.44 - 4171.60] new exposures too that keep them down
[4169.80 - 4174.24] why they're trying to heal we got to
[4171.60 - 4176.68] override we got to ride those
[4174.24 - 4178.52] out where do you work did they spray
[4176.68 - 4180.08] something you're exposed to where do you
[4178.52 - 4181.84] live did they spray something you're
[4180.08 - 4185.08] exposed to it's just it's
[4181.84 - 4189.28] endless there's lots of exposures
[4185.08 - 4192.52] everywhere new relationships public
[4189.28 - 4194.84] bathrooms everything restaurants I've
[4192.52 - 4197.96] been saying this for years it's probably
[4194.84 - 4200.36] the biggest bug spreading Place possible
[4197.96 - 4202.88] is restaurants and hospitals right
[4200.36 - 4205.20] hospitals it's it's already you know we
[4202.88 - 4206.60] already know that you some but you know
[4205.20 - 4208.44] you need to go to a hospital you go to a
[4206.60 - 4210.36] hospital right but there's so much
[4208.44 - 4212.80] exposure there too right but there's so
[4210.36 - 4215.76] much exposure in
[4212.80 - 4218.40] restaurants all the
[4215.76 - 4220.20] same those that's a big place that's the
[4218.40 - 4222.24] big big exposures they don't wash all
[4220.20 - 4224.20] the stuff off all the dishes right all
[4222.24 - 4225.84] the glasses and the forks I talked about
[4224.20 - 4228.00] this in the brains saer book and the
[4225.84 - 4230.04] chefs cut themselves continually and
[4228.00 - 4232.00] then put rubber gloves on and they put
[4230.04 - 4233.60] gloves on nit trial gloves on but they
[4232.00 - 4235.04] got blood on everything even on the
[4233.60 - 4236.48] outside of the glove because they're cut
[4235.04 - 4238.08] and they're just getting it everywhere
[4236.48 - 4239.80] and they put the glove on and now
[4238.08 - 4241.72] they're making your food it's one of the
[4239.80 - 4244.76] biggest exposure places there
[4241.72 - 4247.00] is people making food they need to be
[4244.76 - 4249.48] really careful even when they're home
[4247.00 - 4251.76] making food for people that's how much
[4249.48 - 4254.68] exposure happens out
[4251.76 - 4257.20] there anyway you guys um I'm going to
[4254.68 - 4259.96] let you go this was fun but we're going
[4257.20 - 4262.28] to cover detox again because it really
[4259.96 - 4263.92] needs like a 4H
[4262.28 - 4267.08] hour
[4263.92 - 4269.84] talk and these are just one you know
[4267.08 - 4271.80] this is just one section of it some
[4269.84 - 4275.12] things to
[4271.80 - 4276.64] consider okay and uh and some things to
[4275.12 - 4280.28] avoid by the
[4276.64 - 4282.76] way you know some things you can't avoid
[4280.28 - 4284.36] as well so some things we can avoid
[4282.76 - 4286.56] which is public to toilets when we're
[4284.36 - 4289.60] out we can't avoid all kinds of stuff it
[4286.56 - 4291.68] just happens we get exposure that's okay
[4289.60 - 4293.40] we can do things to take care of it and
[4291.68 - 4297.28] move forward and
[4293.40 - 4302.04] heal but either way look out for the
[4297.28 - 4305.88] detox fear and Chaos it's pared by
[4302.04 - 4308.36] influencer by influencer
[4305.88 - 4311.48] influencer and it stems from places like
[4308.36 - 4317.32] I talked about earlier all
[4311.48 - 4317.32] right love you guys one day at a time
