14
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,800
kind of a funny one because

15
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,519

fat-free raw dish because everybody's

54
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,560
fatting themselves to death

55
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,079
fatting themselves to death that's what

56
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,720
they're doing like

57
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:53,520
fat fat veg gotta be tahini tahini oil

58
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,000

the milk cheese eggs butter butter cow

62
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,399
butter

63
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,840

64
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,439
sheep's butter whatever they can find

65
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,160
it's just like that fat

66
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,440
and that's all that's all fine and all

67
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,120
until you're sick

68
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,640
got the gallstones you got the kidney

69
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,319
stones you got the liver problems you

70
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,440
got the weight gain coming on later on

71
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,480
down the road

72
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,760
and then you get rid of all those

73
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,280
processed foods all those processed

74
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,640
foods and you're still on fat fat

75
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,400
then you go vegan and plant-based and

76
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,640
you're still tanking the fat that that

77
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,560
and then your digestive system just

78
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,480
starts to break down more and more

79
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,239
even if you made improvements it still

80
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,840
starts to break down and we end up in

81
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,879
the same place and now we're like i'm

82
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,920
eating so good

83
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:37,680
i'm eating so great i'm eating so good

84
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,800
why is this happening i'm a vegan and

85
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,120
i'm eating so good

86
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,560

but why am i still getting sick again

89
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,400

vertigo are in here

163
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,560
they're in here if i had where to go i'd

164
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,160
be on the zinc

165
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,759
you you do what your doctor tells you to

166
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,720
do but if i had vertigo i'd be on the

167
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,360
zinc

168
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,800
because it says in here it's

169
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,240
epstein-barr

170
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,479
okay that's what vertigo is it's

171
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,479
inflaming the vagus nerve

172
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:44,240
i'd be on the zinc that's the vimergy

173
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:47,360
zinc right there

174
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:49,600
that's just one thing okay so but it has

175
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,800
to be the right kind of zinc the right

176
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,720

um anka says gastroparesis question mark

287
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,399
can you talk more about it

288
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,519
what happens when you eat too much at

289
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,560
once

290
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:37,120
if you're somebody that's really

291
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:40,240
sensitive you got to keep in mind if you

292
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:42,240
haven't been eating a lot like you

293
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,760
haven't been eating a lot okay it's not

294
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,440
something that you do you don't eat a

295
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,160
lot at once you don't eat a lot of food

296
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,959
at once

297
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,959
keep in mind

298
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,680
that when you start eating more you're

299
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:57,360
going to feel it

300
00:09:53,680 --> 00:10:00,000
because the intestinal tract shrinks

301
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,240
that's how it works and a lot of us lose

302
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,399
our elastasicity in our intestinal tract

303
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:07,519
or small intestinal tract

304
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:09,760
it starts to harden up a little bit if

305
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,560
we've been eating the wrong foods for so

306
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,720
many years

307
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,360
we got pathogens and toxic heavy metals

308
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:18,720
inside our gut because it happens a lot

309
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,800
and what goes on is then you start

310
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,720
eating more so you start eating a big

311
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,760
meal at once and you got a really large

312
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,560
meal

313
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,839
and what happens is that that large meal

314
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,640
starts to push

315
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,680
through the small intestinal tract and

316
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,519
we can really

317
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:36,079
feel it we can really feel it and then

318
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,800
we don't think we digested our food but

319
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:40,880
we did

320
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:43,760
digest our food we digested it enough

321
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,560
and but what happens is larger amounts

322
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,880
of food

323
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,959
sometimes stretches out the small

324
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,800
intestinal tract as it's going down

325
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,720
and we could really feel that it's one

326
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,720
thing another thing is if it's not large

327
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,880
amounts of food and you feel

328
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,399
your intestinal tract you feel

329
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:01,440
discomfort

330
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:03,040
keep in mind that when the nerves in the

331
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,920
lining of the intestinal tract are

332
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,040
inflamed and

333
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:08,000
foods moving through it's rubbing the

334
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,600
lining

335
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,760
and there are foods that don't rub the

336
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,880
lining that make our condition worse

337
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:18,000
like eggs keep that in mind milk cheese

338
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:20,880
butter dairy eggs all of that

339
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,600
doesn't rub gluten bread doesn't rub the

340
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:25,040
lining

341
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:27,440
so you may eat that and not feel it okay

342
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:30,480
but if you eat something like cucumbers

343
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:33,680
and lettuce like this beautiful lettuce

344
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,440
you might feel it rubbing your lining

345
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,200
because your lining is inflamed it

346
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,480
doesn't mean it didn't digest it doesn't

347
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,160
mean these foods aren't healing you

348
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,000
because these are healing foods

349
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,519
but you're gonna feel it a lot of people

350
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,120
have metals

351
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:47,279
and they have a lot of toxic heavy

352
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,760
metals they've got pathogens

353
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:51,440
and they're inside the gut they're

354
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,839
inside the intestinal tract

355
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,839
so keep that in mind there gastroparesis

356
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,560
is in cleanse the heel i talk about it

357
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:59,120
in there

358
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,760
okay and sometimes with gastroparesis

359
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,320
it's all

360
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:05,360
electrical so it's all vagus nerve

361
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:07,680
related and it's coming from the brain

362
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,440
so a lot of cases of gastroparesis are

363
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,200
coming from the brain so keep that in

364
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,680
mind how that works

365
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,959
the brain is not sending the correct

366
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:18,639
signals or they're not

367
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:19,200
reaching the gut so that peristaltic

368
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,519
action

369
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,040
happens and peristaltic action starts to

370
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,639
move and do its thing

371
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,880
you're not getting the signals they're

372
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,399
not matching up because a lot of people

373
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,360
have toxic heavy metals

374
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:32,399
in the brain short circuiting

375
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,680
information

376
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:38,480
that's running down the vagus nerve

377
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:40,320
and heading to the gut creating that

378
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,360
peristaltic action so now you're not

379
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,320
getting that peristaltic

380
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,639
action so so we're not getting that

381
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:49,120
twisting and that massaging that our gut

382
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,519
does as it moves the food down and

383
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,519
through

384
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:53,760
we're not getting that because the

385
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:57,279
signals coming from the brain

386
00:12:53,760 --> 00:13:00,480
are not wired like the the um

387
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:02,880
the brain stem is not receiving

388
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,839
signals from the neurons up in the

389
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,959
larger

390
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:08,320
the top of the brain so the hemispheres

391
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:10,000
so those signals aren't happening

392
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,680
they're not going to the brain stem and

393
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,839
then boom not going down the

394
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,200
down the uh vagus nerve and boom not

395
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,480
going down into the small intestinal

396
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,079
tract and that's a lot

397
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,760
a lot of stuff behind gastroparesis

398
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:22,560
that's why i'm always like we got to get

399
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:24,639
metals out we got to do that that's one

400
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,600
reason the other thing for gastroparesis

401
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,160
is

402
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,040
pathogen infections they're just not

403
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,079
detectable

404
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,639
so viral loads viral loads inside the

405
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:35,279
liver

406
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,079
viral loads inside the intestinal tract

407
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,639
causing

408
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:41,440
lots of inflammation and then that could

409
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,639
get a gastroparesis diagnosis so that's

410
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:48,240
how it works there

411
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:50,880
that's just a couple of tidbits good to

412
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,800
see you guys glad you guys are coming on

413
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:55,279

multi vitamins the multivitamins wreak

429
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,120
havoc

430
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,440
that's one of those things a lot of

431
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,720
those junky multivitamins even ones that

432
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,320
come from companies that are really

433
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,720
reputable and they're expensive they're

434
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,000
just

435
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,760
junk multivitamins etc and bought the

436
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,360
bimergy instead

437
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:42,240
that are supposed to be good for my

438
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,639
symptoms which are neurological

439
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,000
of course lemon water and celery is the

440
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:48,399
holy grail

441
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,040
that's really incredible one of the

442
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,800
tricks

443
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,800
in the industry i'm just going to give

444
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:56,000
you this to you right now you guys

445
00:14:52,800 --> 00:15:00,240
is the multi vitamin or protein

446
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:03,600
powder scams and or multi-vitamin

447
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:05,360
powder scams that's probably one of the

448
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,279
big tricks one of the big scams in the

449
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,720
industry in alternative medicine

450
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,920
so just keep an eye on that you're going

451
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,240
to spend a lot of money on these

452
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,079
multivitamins they're highly irritating

453
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,880
to the intestinal tract and gut

454
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,279
they're irritating to the system they're

455
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,320
they're

456
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:22,320
garbage even they're high priced garbage

457
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,079
from the best companies out there so

458
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,800
what we think is the best companies out

459
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:28,240
there

460
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:30,240
and they use a speck of this in a speck

461
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,639
of that you cannot heal

462
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,920
with a speck of a whole bunch of things

463
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,639
that some

464
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,920
guy at some lab decided to put together

465
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:39,440
and offer that to the

466
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,360
to the to the board members of the

467
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,920
company and the board members are like

468
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,000

469
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,360
that that that sounds good to me what do

470
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,279

multivitamin they priced it all out we

473
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,240
can make a lot of money and it's just a

474
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,759
speck of this and the speck of that

475
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,839
well what do you think what do you think

476
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:58,720

585
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:28,480

the cause of ibs for years and years

592
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:48,960
and what's interesting about ibs is

593
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,360
conventional medicine alternative

594
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:54,640
medicine just believes ibs is

595
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,640
irritable bowel syndrome

596
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,280

medium series streptococcus causes ibs

637

and there's reasons why strep gets fed

638
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:51,039
and we eat the foods we shouldn't eat

639
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,720
that feedstrap and then we have

640
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:53,679
antibiotics throughout our life and the

641
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,600
strep gets worse

642

00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:11,679
though you'll die without glucose

750
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:13,360
your brain dies without glucose it

751
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:13,679
doesn't die without fat your brain's not

752
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,440
made

753
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:16,880
out of so much fat as everybody says

754
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,080
it's made out of it's made out of

755
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,559
glycogen storage

756
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:22,559
hardened glycogen deposits that's the

757
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:24,080
majority of what makes makes up and

758
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:27,679
creates up all the glial

759
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:30,080
cells it's not fat

760
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:31,679
so misinformation about fat just gets

761
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,320
everybody in trouble gets them in

762
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:35,039
trouble but

763
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:37,360
there's reasons for that you're not

764
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:39,039
supposed to get healthy

765
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,559
if you get healthy by chance and you

766
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,679
learn how to kick out the bad you know

767
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:44,159
processed foods and you

768
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:44,960
at least keep yourself going that way

769
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:48,240
right

770
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,840
that's not what the industry wants

771
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,080
the pharmaceutical industry wants you

772
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:56,400
sick they want you dying

773
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:58,960
they do they do they need you sick

774
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:02,159
in order to keep them going chopping up

775
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,159
some tomatoes right here

776
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:08,240
i think you guys know that though

777
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,480
so i'm making a salad just working on it

778
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,600
as you see you guys there's fats already

779
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,039
in every food

780
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,480
there's fats in this beautiful lettuce

781
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:15,279
right here this butter leaf lettuce has

782
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,960
fat in it

783
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:23,760
it's got omega-3s in it usable omega-3s

784
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:27,120
usable right real bioavailable

785
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:29,520
and keep this in mind

786
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:31,039
you think you're on a keto diet you're

787
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,480
not on a keto diet

788
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:34,320
you're just on a healthier animal

789
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,080
protein diet

790
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:38,640
or if you're plant-based on a keto

791
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:41,360
plant-based diet you're just on a

792
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,880
you're just on a healthier vegan diet

793
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,880
based basically right

794
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,799
so keep in mind that no one goes into

795
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,960
ketosis anymore

796
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:50,240
that was given up a long time ago

797
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,279
because people die when they go into

798
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,919
ketosis

799
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:55,520
so the whole ketogenic diet is just

800
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:57,440
really a trendy name for something no

801
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:59,360
one even enters into like

802
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,520
you're actually doing why go keto now

803
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:03,760
well you're not going to go into ketosis

804
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:05,120
so number one flaw you don't want to go

805
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,600
into ketosis either

806
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:09,039
but it's the number one flaw of diets

807
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,159
that are created of nobody knowing

808
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:12,159
what's going on

809
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:14,399
because what happens is if you eat one

810
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:15,520
avocado on a keto diet you can't go into

811
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:17,360
ketosis

812
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:19,679
you can't i don't care what practitioner

813
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:21,440
you go to what diet expert you talk to

814
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:24,159
what trainer you talk to

815
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:26,080
what blood test you had looking for

816
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:27,600
ketones you can't you can't go into

817
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:30,320
ketosis

818
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:32,960
if you have one avocado in that diet

819
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:36,559
because the avocado is a lot of sugar

820
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:39,600
cheese is a lot of sugar you can't go

821
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:40,480
into ketosis eating cheese because it's

822
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,880
a lot of sugar

823
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,600
if you have a small little handful of

824
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,440
berries

825
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,880
you can't go into ketosis so if your

826
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,480
ketogenic diet allows you to have

827
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,080
berries and you'll notice that

828
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,840
the keto diet allows you to have all

829
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:55,360
this like berries

830
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:56,559
green apples cheese the keto diet the

831
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,720
ketogenic diets have

832
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:59,679
you know it's avocado it's nuts it's

833
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,960
seeds

834
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:06,000
years ago the keto diet

835
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:08,880
okay was a dangerous test

836
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,840
they removed everything with sugar out

837
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,840
of your diet

838
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,360
they removed the avocado which is sugar

839
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:15,039
they remove yeah sugar

840
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:17,039
avocados got a lot of sugar in it it's a

841
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:17,840
fruit it's a fatty fruit it's got a lot

842
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:20,320
of sugar in it

843
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:22,080
they removed the avocado they removed

844
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,440
all nuts and seeds peanut butter which

845
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:26,159
is sweet

846
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:27,520
peanut butter sweet there's nuts are

847
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:29,120
sweet

848
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:31,039
a walnut like they're they have a

849
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,520
sweetness to it because it's part sugar

850
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:34,080
right

851
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,559
they removed all the nuts all the seeds

852
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,760
right

853
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:40,159
and they put people literally on no

854
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:42,159
calories that that are derived from on

855
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:43,600
any level from any kind of carbohydrate

856
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:46,799
or sugar

857
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:49,200
and then they watched people die because

858
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:52,640
their brain went so void

859
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:55,039
of glucose so the ketogenic experiment

860
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,799
was an epic disaster that killed people

861
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:59,120
but they kept the name but they brought

862
00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:01,120
in sugar is what they did

863
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:02,960
and even meat has sugar in it so what

864
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:05,600
they would do is they would boil

865
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,720
the sugar out of meat because meat has

866
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:09,600
sugar

867
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,159
right the animal's blood the animal's

868
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:13,520
blood

869
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:16,559
is sugar that's how it works

870
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:20,000
the blood inside an animal is

871
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:23,440
sugar your blood has

872
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,440
glucose in it it's sugar right

873
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:27,120
so they did was the ketogenic experiment

874
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,279
many years ago decades ago

875
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,960
what they did was they removed the sugar

876
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:36,080
out of the meat

877
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:40,159
they boiled the sugar out of the meat

878
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:42,080
right they didn't fry the meat and give

879
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:45,360
people fried meat

880
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:48,960
they didn't give people broiled

881
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:49,679
beef they boiled the sugar out of the

882
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,679
beef

883
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:54,480
and they only gave that to the people in

884
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:56,720
the experiment the ketogenic experiment

885
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,760
and what they found was when they took

886
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:01,440
out every

887
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:02,960
single molecule of sugar the person got

888
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,880
sick lethargic

889
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,080
lost their thinking process couldn't

890
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:10,320
function and either

891
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:13,360
died or went into a coma

892
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:16,399
or just could barely function

893
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,960
so they realized the ketosis experiment

894
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:20,960
was

895
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:23,919
a dangerous one a really really bad idea

896
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:26,799
so now the ketogenic diet we have today

897
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:29,200
there's carbs in it everywhere

898
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:31,279
there's carbs in it everywhere they also

899
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:33,120
notice with the old ketogenic diet when

900
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:36,080
they started bringing that in

901
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:37,279
to the mainstream there was already a

902
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:40,240
little bit of carb

903
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:42,480
in here wheat germ wheat germ was

904
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,760
allowed in the old ketogenic diet

905
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:46,000
you know you were allowed to do wheat

906
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:49,519
germ so you had a little bit of

907
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,799
carbohydrate in places right you had a

908
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:52,240
little bit

909
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:54,320
but people were getting heart attacks

910
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,519
and strokes they had no antioxidants

911
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,760
they had no

912
00:31:55,519 --> 00:32:00,240
they had no leafy greens of course they

913
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:01,760
didn't even have iceberg lettuce anyway

914
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,519
they didn't have oranges they didn't

915
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:05,120
have things that keep you healthy and

916
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:07,600
strong

917
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,960
is what they didn't have so people would

918
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,600
get heart attacks people would get

919
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,360
stroked

920
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,880
people get heart disease real fast to

921
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,799
get those cholesterol problems off the

922
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,559
chart they get everything all wrong

923
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:20,720
and so then the ketogenic diet had to

924
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:23,039
make it like a transformation you guys

925
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:25,120
and they had to start putting sugar in

926
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:26,960
it so one of the first starts of the

927
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:29,039
sugar was green juices

928
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:31,600
so green juices entered the ketogenic

929
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:34,000
diet green juices

930
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:35,760
and green juices that had a little bit

931
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,000
of glucose in it

932
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:40,000
because some of the vegetables are like

933
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,880
green juices with beet in there that's

934
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,760
glucose

935
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:45,919
green juices with carrot in there green

936
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:48,399
juices and then they started putting in

937
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:50,120
a few berries and then they started

938
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:53,200
putting in the ketogenic diet

939
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:54,480
avocado more sugar you see

940
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,720
there's putting more sugar in your

941
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:59,120
ketogenic diet guess what

942
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:01,039
ketosis stops then they put a little

943
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:02,399
cheese in there oh high quality cheese

944
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:04,159
in your ketogenic diet

945
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:06,080
that's good for you right and they put

946
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:07,760
that in there and then they put butter

947
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:11,039
in there which is sugar

948
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:14,640
it's not just fat butters sugar

949
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:18,399
sweet it's like butter's sweet

950
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:19,039
it is right not candy sweet but it's

951
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:22,559
sweet

952
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:24,559
there's a sweetness to it okay and then

953
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:26,640
in these foods had nutrients in there

954
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:28,960
they had nuts then they put nuts and

955
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:30,720
seeds in the ketogenic diet which were

956
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:33,760
sugars

957
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:35,600
see and the green juice and the berries

958
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:37,360
and the avocado and the nuts and seeds

959
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,000
had nutrients in it which started

960
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,840
helping get

961
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,360
people get a little bit better and

962
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:44,399
they're and it's like they're

963
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:45,679
redesigning a screw-up and they're tr

964
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:46,880
they're like redesigning it it's

965
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:48,240
unbelievable what happens they're trying

966
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,720
to redesign the screw

967
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,320
is what's going on and in the end all

968
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,919
they did was make a healthier animal

969
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:56,159
protein diet

970
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:57,440
that's all a healthier animal protein

971
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,960
diet that happens to have

972
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,240
a few more antioxidants and some

973
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,760
nutrients here and there and you get a

974
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,799
little bit of berries if you want you

975
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,240
got a little bit of that

976
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:05,919
you get a little bit of you know you got

977
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,679
your avocado which is your healthy fat

978
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:09,200
because avocado is good for you

979
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:10,639
sure it's good for you but if you're

980
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:12,240
trying to heal from chronic illness it's

981
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:13,919
not your best friend but it's still good

982
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:16,320
for you

983
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:17,760
and then people were craving more sugar

984
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,119
and they're craving more sugar so they

985
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,240
had to offer something in there so then

986
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:21,760
they started throwing in all the

987
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:23,679
chocolate

988
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,440
butter fat with a little bit of that raw

989
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:28,720
sugar in there or honey and

990
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:30,399
raw sugar but people were craving more

991
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:32,000
sugar in the ketogenic diet so they had

992
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:32,560
to put more things in there so they had

993
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,359
to put

994
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:37,679
more green apples and more berries and

995
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:39,440
they had to put something in here

996
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:42,240
and now there's keto stuff that's like

997
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:44,399
keto donuts and cookies and cakes now

998
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:46,240
it's that's keto friendly that's keto

999
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:48,639
friendly it's got this many grams of

1000
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:50,720
carbohydrates that's keto friendly

1001
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:52,639
and that's how it works you see it's all

1002
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:54,159
a game of

1003
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:56,560
not knowing what the heck's going on

1004
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:57,839
it's a game of scam it's a game of all

1005
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,839
this

1006
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:01,680
but everybody just walks into it like

1007
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:03,119
you walk into it uneducated and

1008
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,599
everybody walks into it uneducated

1009
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:06,000
they're like

1010
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:07,680
you just walk right into it like oh what

1011
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,520
really that's keto friendly good let me

1012
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,560
have that oh am i in ketosis nobody

1013
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,560
knows

1014
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,839
but what happens is you end up binging

1015
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:16,800
and that happened all the time

1016
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:18,400
because there was no sugar in their diet

1017
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,160
because no one was eating avocados in

1018
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,760
the original ketogenic diet they weren't

1019
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:23,119
eating nuts and seeds and berries and

1020
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,520
they weren't eating anything that they

1021
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:26,560
were

1022
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:29,440
binging they'd be like

1023
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:31,200
they'd be keto for a week and binge

1024
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,079
because they needed some kind of glucose

1025
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,760
for their brain

1026
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:35,359
you see how it works they needed glucose

1027
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,440
for their brain

1028
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:39,839
now the keto diet is doing celery juice

1029
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:42,480
so that's in the keto diet now

1030
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:44,800
so celery juice is in the keto diet now

1031
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:46,320
celery's got glucose in it still

1032
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,839
you can't go into ketosis if you're

1033
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:50,000
doing celery juice you can't go into

1034
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:52,320
ketosis

1035
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,079
and but they're doing celery juice it's

1036
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,440
helping the real problem so then

1037
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:57,839
someone's tagging

1038
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:59,680
ketogenic diets really helping people

1039
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:01,760
look this one person's getting better

1040
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:04,000
this one person's just lost 50 pounds on

1041
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,920
a ketogenic diet for the last six months

1042
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,160
there's no other person and what's

1043
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:10,720
happening is in the ketogenic diet

1044
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:12,720
they're putting in things that help you

1045
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,839
they're like old medical medium tools

1046
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:16,079
they're putting in

1047
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:17,040
celery juice and they're putting in some

1048
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:19,040
juices

1049
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,160
and they're putting in a little of this

1050
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:23,040
and they're putting in a little

1051
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,920
spirulina then they're putting in there

1052
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,599
they're actually

1053
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,440
they're actually putting in things then

1054
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:29,280
they're putting in some spinach in your

1055
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,960
keto diet now for the first time

1056
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,560
then you're putting in cilantro in your

1057
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:34,240
keto diet now for the first time

1058
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:35,839
and then they're saying the ketogenic

1059
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:38,880
diet is getting you better

1060
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:40,960
not the things that get you better like

1061
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:44,000
asparagus and cilantro

1062
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:44,800
and spinach and berries and whatever and

1063
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,800
they're not saying

1064
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,400
in the celery juice they're not saying

1065
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:51,520
those are what's getting you better

1066
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:52,640
they're wrapping it up in this keto keto

1067
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:54,560
bowl

1068
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:56,560
that's keto that's getting it better so

1069
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:59,520
this is really interesting stuff on how

1070
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,520
things work you know

1071
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:03,440
yeah let's make a salad we're still

1072
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:06,560
doing that

1073
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:08,960
very very interesting

1074
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,680
when you think about it right so what

1075
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:12,800
i'm going to do

1076
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:14,720
is i'm going to

1077
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,960
chop up the cucumber a little bit okay

1078
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:18,800
so i like chopping up thin slices so i'm

1079
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:20,800
going to do that right here you guys

1080
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,400
and i'm chopping it up on an angle a

1081
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,599
little bit so they don't roll off the

1082
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,359
cutting board

1083
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:27,520
so if you do a little one did one rolled

1084
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:30,320
off how do you like that

1085
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:33,040
so we're gonna do a little bit of i like

1086
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:36,160
them kind of thin like this

1087
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:41,040
don't like them real real thick

1088
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:41,040
right okay

challenge next week i'm pumped up

1096
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:10,000
actually pumped up janine

1097
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:10,000
what about hc's g drops it's terrifying

1098
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,800
hcg

1099
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:20,960
the hcg

1100
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:26,000
terrified popping some cucumber on here

1101
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:28,960
not a fan at all probably one of the

1102
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:31,440
most ridiculous things because what they

1103
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:33,599
did is they just starved you to death

1104
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,480
they just they put you on 500 calories a

1105
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:36,960
day

1106
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:39,119
got people exercising on 500 calories a

1107
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,640
day you'd end up binging yourself to

1108
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:43,119
death i've seen so many people just

1109
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:44,800
binge themselves like crazy it stresses

1110
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:45,520
out their adrenals stresses out their

1111
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:49,760
liver

1112
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:49,760
they're sicker than ever before from hcg

1113
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:54,320
people get sicker than ever before

1114
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:58,839
they go into it well whoa something's

1115
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:01,760
changing something's happening

1116
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:04,560
man and then they get

1117
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:07,359
screwed over in the end because that's

1118

weight issues

1158
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:10,560
is derived from a stagnant sluggish

1159
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,560
liver

1160
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:16,480
just letting you know it's medical

1161
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:18,240
medium information

1162
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:20,880
friend of mine just told me that they

1163
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:24,079
were listening to some kind of

1164
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:26,160
opera somewhere and then a commercial

1165
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:29,359
came on between the opera

1166
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:32,560
and it was this doctor

1167
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:36,880
saying how weight gain is caused by

1168
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:40,079
an overburdened stagnant liver

1169
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:43,839
to sell a product right first of all

1170
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:46,319
medical medium publish this first

1171
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:48,000
it's spirit of compassion's information

1172
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:49,680
that our weight gain is derived from an

1173
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,200
overburdened sluggish liver

1174
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:52,800
and there's no scientific study that

1175
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:54,720
discovered it prior

1176
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:56,640
and there's a doctor sitting there

1177
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:58,800
reading liver rescue book

1178
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:00,720
not telling anybody and then saying in a

1179
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:02,400
commercial to sell her product that it's

1180
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:05,359
coming from weight loss is coming from

1181
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,359
an overburdened liver

1182
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:19,920
just like come on i think it's a

1183
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:19,920
twilight zone personally

1184
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:28,400
but i like the twilight zone

1185
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,400
it's all right

1186
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:32,880
makes life interest interesting you know

1187
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,160
all right so we got this herb salad

1188
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:41,200
we're moving on and i'm not

1189
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:42,800
telling people that i'm the source so i

1190
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,920
can just be like oh i'm the source it's

1191
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,040
just that how are you going to find out

1192
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:47,839
how to heal because

1193
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:49,440
what what this person did is this person

1194
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:50,960
also offered a bunch of things that

1195
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:53,200
makes your problem worse

1196
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:54,880
so it's like okay your liver is causing

1197
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:56,800
your weight gain because it's stagnant

1198
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:58,720
sluggish i'm doctor whatever

1199
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:00,240
and then she went on like something like

1200
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:02,400
that that this is the cause of it and

1201
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:03,440
then here's the powder i want you to be

1202
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,200

whatever it is and you know

1205
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,400
and it's like no you're not gonna help

1206
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:12,400
anything with that you gotta learn how

1207
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,839
to do it let's get some dolls in here

1208
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:15,359
so what i like to do with the dolls is

1209

00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:16,400
happens is if you got bacteria

1253
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:17,119
inside your gut right and viruses inside

1256
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:24,319
it's not going to want to go

1257
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,119
bacteria and viruses don't want to just

1258
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:26,640
leave

1259
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:27,839
they don't be like okay throw my hands

1260
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:30,240
in the air and i'm going to go they've

1261
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:32,480
been living in you for a long time

1262
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:33,760
they've been grown by the classified

1263
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:37,119
medical industry

1264
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:38,800
grown in labs out of eggs and they've

1265
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:41,119
been put out into the world

1266
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:43,200
purposely so that you have all these

1267
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:47,599
different pathogens inside of you

1268
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:50,720
right that's what the the weaponized

1269
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:53,920
biological warfare you know

1270
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:55,520
all started before 1920. so they started

1271
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:57,040
learning how the classified medical

1272
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:59,280
industry started learning how to

1273
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:00,880
propagate all these bugs and then they

1274
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:03,280
were like whoa we could actually

1275
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:05,200
create illness in people to feed the

1276
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:07,440
medical industry for years to come and

1277
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:08,880
the publicly the publicly known medical

1278
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:10,560
research and science will never be aware

1279
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:11,760
of it unless they discover it as time

1280
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:15,440
goes on

1281
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:16,079
and it was a really great incredible

1282
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,440
scheme

1283
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:18,560
of all time when you think about it

1284
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,280
you've got the classified medical

1285
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,800
industry

1286
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:22,640
raising all these bugs behind

1287
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:24,319
everybody's backs and then you've got

1288
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:25,839
your publicly known medical industry

1289
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:27,680
like the medical schools and all that

1290
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:29,680
pumping out doctors right

1291
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:30,960
and doing all that stuff in research and

1292
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:33,200
they're two worlds

1293
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:34,560
and they in the private industry the

1294
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,280
classified industry released all the

1295
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:39,200
bugs

1296
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:41,359
in 1920 1930 1940 1950

1297
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:43,599
all the herpes simplex ones and herpes

1298
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:46,560
simplex twos right

1299
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:47,359
all released you know so everybody

1300
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:49,920
thought that

1301
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:51,839
woodstock is why herpes simplex 1 went

1302
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:54,640
around and herpes simplex 2 went around

1303
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:56,800
it was because of woodstock in 1969

1304
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:59,040
and it wasn't because of woodstock and

1305
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:00,720
everybody having free sex in 1969

1306
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:02,800
because that's what they blamed it on

1307
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:04,720
that's not why simplex 1 and simplex 2

1308
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:05,760
went around simplex 1 and simplex 2 were

1309
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:07,920
released

1310
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:09,920
before night right around 1920 early

1311
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:10,240
before 1920 it was released and they

1312
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:12,079
were

1313
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:13,520
releasing it publicly with nobody

1314
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:15,119
knowing it and they were putting it out

1315
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:16,079
there so people would get simplex 1 and

1316
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:17,839
simplex 2.

1317
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:19,680
and then people would pass it around by

1318
00:47:17,839 --> 00:47:21,599
the time woodstock came around and

1319
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:23,760
you know that age of free love came

1320
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:25,440
around in the 1960s

1321
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:27,440
everybody was passing around their

1322
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:29,599
simplex ones and simplex twos but it

1323
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:31,520
wasn't because really because of that

1324
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:33,680
it was because it was put out there to

1325
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:36,000
get passed around you see how it works

1326
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:38,000
and so the classified industry put out

1327
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:41,200
all these bugs all through the 1920s

1328
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:43,359
and 1930s and 1940s and the epstein bars

1329
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:44,480
and the cytomegaloviruses and the hhv-6

1330
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:45,920
were all put out there

1331
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:47,839
and then the publicly known medical

1332
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:49,359
research science never knew why anybody

1333
00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:51,040
was sick they still don't know now but

1334
00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:52,480
they stumbled across the bugs along the

1335
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:54,240
way and was like whoa

1336
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:56,000
