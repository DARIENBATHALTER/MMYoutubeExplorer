you're changing the world with me that

24
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:10,200
we're doing it it it you know it it was

25
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:13,200
so hard it started out in childhood with

26
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:16,640
Spirit saying to me look we have to get

27
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,799
ahead somehow of the misinformation

28
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,560
that's out there in any way we can we

29
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:24,479
have to help people and and hearing that

30
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:27,119
when I was young it just it was too much

31
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:29,920
it was just way too much what is he

32
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:33,119
talking about what is spirit talk

33
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:35,720
talking about and it was really hard to

34
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,479
really kind of bite into that and then

35
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,960
you know as the years went on I said

36
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:41,600
okay it's time to do this it's time to

37
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,200
do this now we have to really do this

38
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,600
because there's so much misinformation

39
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:49,479
out there it's flooded like never before

40
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:51,520
and I remember even 10 years ago 10

41
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:53,119
years ago there was there first of all

42
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,640
there was barely any information out

43
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:58,680
there number one I mean I was giving

44
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:01,920
information just as advanced now um to

45
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:05,280
my to my clients all the time and other

46
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,680
doctors at that time but there wasn't

47
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,319
really you know it was still kind of

48
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:12,800
early 10 15 years ago still kind of

49
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:13,680
early in the making of of of what was

50
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,920
happening out there with the

51
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,840
misinformation all you know flying

52
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,080
around the internet it wasn't so

53
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,319
saturated there weren't so many

54
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,720
different belief

55
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,720
systems saturated in in the system out

56
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,879
there of

57
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,480
misinformation so there was lack of

58
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:32,400
information there was a lack of

59
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,000
information and this was really hard

60
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,680
really hard especially for hard for

61
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,200
younger people that were sick with

62
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,800
chronic illness oh my God and you may be

63
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,040
one of them you may have been one of

64
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,920
them and you may be one of them now a

65
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:48,200
younger person now dealing with symptoms

66
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:51,040
and things like that now and you know

67
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:53,519
and and it it's it's difficult well back

68
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:57,000
10 15 years ago there was just nothing

69
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:59,120
there there was nothing there and uh you

70
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,319
go a little bit further really nothing

71
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:05,200
there oh my God and so I was able to

72
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:07,239
deliver this information just as just as

73
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,280
up to dat and Advance as it is decades

74
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:12,200
ahead of what's out there even now was

75
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:16,360
able to deliver that to people back then

76
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:18,280
going all the way back but there wasn't

77
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:20,080
there wasn't that flood of

78
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:24,560
misinformation that was out there to a

79
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,799

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,599
an honor to just have you here and you

101
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,360
know back like I said back 10 years ago

102
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:12,840
and a little further when you were when

103
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:16,320
you were younger when mean meaning when

104
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,799
someone was young at that time and had a

105
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,919
problem whether they had a condition

106
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:21,880
coming on mystery symptoms you name it

107
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:24,400
they're going to doctors and there was

108
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:26,720
just nothing on the internet and what

109
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,680
was out there you know I mean wasn't

110
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:33,000
that great so that was difficult and

111
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:35,080
then of course if you're if if you know

112
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,680
10 years ago if if you weren't a young

113
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:40,240
person and you were you know you were

114
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:43,840
whatever a little bit old or whatever

115
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:46,600
and then we sick chronically back 20 30

116
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:50,039
years ago oh my God you know it's it was

117
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:54,000
so difficult people ha have been through

118
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:56,400
so much with their journey in healing

119
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,919
and now today they they have challenges

120
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,919
that are a little bit different

121
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,479
challenges of so many different things

122
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,479
to choose from so much different

123
00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:07,840
information to choose from where to go

124
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:10,680
what to do how to do it and and that's

125
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:13,120
why I you know I've always always say

126
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:17,039
that's why I say in in front of my radio

127
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:20,479
shows too now that this is the only

128
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:22,240
place and and I know that's pushing it

129
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:24,680
right the way I'm saying it I know it

130
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,360
but it's I promise you it's true this is

131
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:28,759
the only place where the information is

132
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:30,160
not tampered with and it's not

133
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:32,280
manipulated

134
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,840
by any kind of interest group but along

135
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:36,400
the way if other information was or you

136
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:38,440
know medical funding with the strings

137
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,120
attached and the the botched up research

138
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:43,240
the thumb on the scale research you know

139
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,360
the lobbyist that no one knows about in

140
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,680
alternative medicine I mean oh my God

141
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,280
there's lobbyists in alternative

142
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,720
medicine nobody knows this I mean nobody

143
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,360
talks about it it's

144
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,800
unreal and the internal Kickbacks the

145
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,080
persuaded belief systems both

146
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,479
conventional and alternative and the

147
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:01,800
private panels of people the private pan

148
00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:03,800
panels of people that make decisions for

149
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,080
you that have don't even have health

150
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:08,520
problems so they don't even know what

151
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:12,120
you went through and the health field

152
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:15,840
payoffs and the trendy traps that are

153
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:17,680
online and so yeah and and of course in

154
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,280
other books so I say that this is the

155
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,160
only place that doesn't have that no

156
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,800
this information's pure it's untampered

157
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:27,039
with it's clean it comes from the source

158
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:29,160
I was born to hear and that Source makes

159
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:32,560
you the expert that Source makes you the

160
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:35,400
expert ERT it takes you to that next

161
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:38,360
level that level you know you just we

162
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:40,440
can't find any other place right now

163
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:43,400
when it comes down to chronic illness

164
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:45,120
when it comes down to chronic illness so

165
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:48,120
and that's most important because

166
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,840
chronic illness leads to so many things

167
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,400
it leads to all kinds of trouble and

168
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:54,759
problems and everything else chronic

169
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:57,919
illness that's where we're in trouble

170
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:59,400
here meaning in the industries and we

171
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,800
have to we have to do something about

172
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,039
about it and that's what these books are

173
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,680
that's what the thyroid healing book is

174
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:05,280
so thank you for being here at this

175
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,080

00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:10,639
of gut health the secrets of gut health

177

and I want to I want to kind of tie it

178
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:17,400
into the thyroid a little bit because

179
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:19,599
everything right now is getting blamed

180
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:22,120
on the thyroid too so the thyroid

181
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:24,680
Experts of the day are trying to push

182
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:28,280
everything into the thyroid every

183
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:29,960

is ahead of the curve this this big

215
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,919
package of misinformation where there's

216
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,279
a whole bunch of experts now on thyroid

217
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,959
claiming that all these symptoms are

218
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:47,399
your thyroid and and how glorious is it

219
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:49,720
that we have this big

220
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:51,320
answer and so it's making the thyroid

221
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,440
Experts of today look like they're

222
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:56,959
they're they they know what's going on

223
00:08:53,440 --> 00:09:01,360
but that's not how it works all these

224
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:02,760
symptoms are not thyroid related are not

225
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,519
thyroid

226
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:08,000
related and they're even

227
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:10,519
throwing um gut health issues many

228
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,760
different gut health issues

229
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:16,279
into into thyroid

230
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:18,200
relation now we're going to break this

231
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:22,320
apart we're going to talk about what's

232
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:24,480
going on thyroid problems thyroid

233
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,279
problems and I have I have over a 100

234
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,959
symptoms and conditions in thyroid

235
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:32,160
healing that explain to what's going on

236
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:34,320
to what degree if it's thyroid related

237
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:38,040
or not thyroid

238
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:40,800
related and there's um there's there's

239
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:42,240
undiscovered hormones within the thyroid

240
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,320
that are not even discovered by research

241
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,440
and science yet in what these hormones

242
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:49,440
do and what your the capabilities of

243
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:51,040
what your thyroid does that research

244
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,320
research and science hasn't even touched

245
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,880
upon what the thyroid can do for you and

246
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:58,200
what is doing for you even when it's

247
00:09:54,880 --> 00:10:00,399
hypo even when it's partially removed or

248
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:02,560
removed you wouldn't

249
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,440
believe what it can

250
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:08,519
do

251
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:11,440
so basically though so the hip thing the

252
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:14,240
hip trendy new thing is you package it

253
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:17,040
all into thyroid so you know you go to

254
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,959
your doctor just gaining some weight and

255
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,320

256
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:23,240

257
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:25,720
oh yeah the thyroid numbers are off or

258
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:27,360
the thyroid numbers are fine but I still

259
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,240
suspect you have a hidden thyroid

260
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,959
problem so we're going to start

261
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:33,640

depression thrown into the thyroid

285
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,240
that's one that's really getting pushed

286
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:31,760
into the thyroid now by the experts by

287
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:35,200

00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:54,000
chopping into that a little bit there's

297
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,079
there's a reason we're going to chop

298
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,120
also

299
00:11:55,079 --> 00:12:00,680

319
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:56,880
taking notes or whatever you need to

320
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:58,839
do um so let's talk about this a little

321
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:01,160
bit constipation getting thrown into the

322
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:02,680
the whole thyroid the whole thyroid

323
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:05,800
package

324
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:09,240
lately um well if your thyroids

325
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:11,600
not not uh up to par if it's not

326
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:13,120
producing what it needs to produce if

327
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,519
it's not producing the hormone it needs

328
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:18,040
to produce if there's anything going on

329
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:19,760
with the thyroid whatsoever um if it's

330
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:21,639
inflamed if there's

331
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,959
Hashimoto but you also have other

332
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:25,800
symptoms involved and that's why

333
00:13:23,959 --> 00:13:28,240
everything's getting packaged into the

334
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:30,600
thyroid so it's like one of these things

335
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:33,680
where you know a doctor an expert or

336
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:37,360
somebody will be like well um there's

337
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:40,120
constipation too so that it's got to be

338
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:42,120
the thyroid so the the thyroid hormones

339
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:44,360
are lacking so the constipation is going

340
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:48,399
to be happening so that's something

341
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:51,800
that's occurring right now in the in the

342
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:55,519
new world of medicine that we we live in

343
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:57,839
today but they don't have much to do

344
00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:00,600
with each other they don't have much to

345
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:02,720
do with each other at all all

346
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:05,560
constipation you know that's that's

347
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,519
mostly with other things happening like

348
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:09,959
inflammation occurring in the small

349
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,920
intestinal tract inflammation occurring

350
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:15,800
in the

351
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:19,600
colon that's more to do with

352
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:21,079
constipation um less peristaltic action

353
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,519
due to

354
00:14:21,079 --> 00:14:27,000
inflammation um the nervous system

355
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:28,920
certain nerves going all to the colon or

356
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,279
the small intestinal tract that that

357
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:33,560
allow for creating that peristaltic

358
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:35,600
action maybe not be getting the right

359
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:36,959
signal through those nerves the person

360
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,360
may not be getting the right signals

361
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:40,600
going through those nerves going to the

362
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:44,560
colon going to the small intestinal

363
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:47,480
tract to give it that twist it

364
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:50,360
needs a liver

365
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:52,560
issue big one for constipation sluggish

366
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:53,560
liver stagnant liver that's a big one

367
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,680
for

368
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:59,680
constipation very big

369
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:01,519
one okay so these are more what we're

370
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,519
talking about why would the intestinal

371
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:06,320
tract or colon be

372
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:08,279
inflamed could be a viral issue going on

373
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,759
inside the liver a little bit of old

374
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:12,680
Epstein bar maybe some other kind of

375
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:15,440
virus in the liver going

376
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:18,279
on and maybe a little bit of strep a

377
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:20,240
cacus a little bit of strep chronic

378
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:22,199
that's always in the intestinal tract

379
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,880
small intestinal tract or large

380
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:27,519
intestinal track causing some

381
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:30,519
inflammation little bit pockets of ecoli

382
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:32,480
causing some inflammation as well um

383
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:34,480
toxins coming from a sluggish

384
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,399
liver and there's a lot of different

385
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:39,360
toxins that sit inside a

386
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:41,240
liver and those toxins can get into the

387
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,680
colon and into the intestinal tract

388
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:46,480
let's cover some of those toxins toxins

389
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:48,800
from medications such as thyroid

390
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:51,600
medication yeah the thyroid medication

391
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,480
is is a funny thing because it builds up

392
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,519
in the

393
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:57,000
liver so it just builds up it builds up

394
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,920
it builds up it builds up the liver has

395
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,680
to absorb it like a sponge Non-Stop for

396
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:03,240
years and years and years then it has to

397
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,480
figure out a way to get that thyroid

398
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:07,120
medication out liver gets nice and

399
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:09,120
sluggish it can't function anymore

400
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,600
thyroid medication has to get out

401
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,800
somehow it finds its way inside the

402
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:16,800
colon over

403
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:19,920
time and sits in the lining of the colon

404
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:21,920
doesn't leave so fast medications

405
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,120
they're not quick to leave the body

406
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,480
they're not one of these things that

407
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,639
they're just so quick to leave the body

408
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,399
that's not how medications work

409
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:30,160
especially thyroid medication is not a

410
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:34,560
medication actually leaves the body so

411
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:38,079
quickly toxic heavy metals lead chromium

412
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:39,639
nickel so lead chromium nickel Mercury

413
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:42,639
aluminum

414
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:44,600
copper uh arsenic the list goes on heavy

415
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:48,480
toxic heavy metals inside the

416
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:50,120
liver viruses Epstein bar hhv6 shingles

417
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,839
cyega

418
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:57,000
virus viral toxins that creates so many

419
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:59,920
symptoms that we talk about in thyroid

420
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,759
healing when I say we it's spirit I talk

421
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:04,600
about in thyroid

422
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:06,439
healing so all all the different

423
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,959
symptoms that we get for chronic

424
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:09,439
illnesses like chronic fatigue syndrome

425
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:12,240
all the tingles and numbs all this

426
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:16,120
different stuff there's neurotoxins

427
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:18,919
related and but like I said you know

428
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:20,919
these illnesses these symptoms get

429
00:17:18,919 --> 00:17:22,760
totally thrown into the thyroid basket

430
00:17:20,919 --> 00:17:24,199
now that's what the experts do cuz

431
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:27,839
experts don't

432
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:29,559
know you know the the recent information

433
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,760
it's out there internet or books or

434
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:34,000
whatever they just don't know where

435
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:35,480
these symptoms come from so hey they're

436
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,559
Heroes it comes from the thyroid now

437
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:41,080
that's the new thing so now the heroes

438
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:44,200
it's not coming from the thyroid it's

439
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:46,919
not the thyroid is just one more symptom

440
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:49,600
with everything else it's one more

441
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:51,919
symptom with everything else that's the

442
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:54,120
big secret that's the big

443
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:55,880
truth the thyroid is just one more

444
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:57,720
symptom the thyroid does have problems

445
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:59,159
it does get injured it does get involved

446
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,440
we're going to go into into that a

447
00:17:59,159 --> 00:18:02,000
little bit today but we're going to do

448
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:05,000
that even more in the next webinar it's

449
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,520
going to be focused mainly on thyroid

450
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,240
this is about the

451
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:12,880
gut but so what happens is everything is

452
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:15,200
just thrown into the thyroid

453
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,840
basket so you can have the neurotoxins

454
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,360
inside the liver the dermato toxins

455
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:22,080
inside the liver viral casing so that's

456
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:24,559
dead bodies of viruses and bacteria and

457
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:27,320
all kinds of great stuff pesticides

458
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:28,840
herbicides fungicides rodenticides

459
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,880
insecticides

460
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:32,799
they all sit inside the

461
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:38,360
liver

462
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:40,200
radiation sits in liver solvents and fat

463
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:44,960
fat sit inside the

464
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:47,520
liver fats it's old rancid fats culate

465
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,679
and they just sit inside the

466
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:52,360
liver and they weaken the liver make the

467
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:54,480
liver sluggish and then we have

468
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:56,760
constipation we have

469
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:59,559
bloating we

470
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:02,159
have sometimes B of

471
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:04,000
gastritis we get to a point where we can

472
00:19:02,159 --> 00:19:07,200
get set up for diverticulitis

473
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:10,520
diverticulosis down the

474
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:14,320
road our candida levels can rise cuz

475
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:15,880
candida is trying to save our butts

476
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,880
trying to save our

477
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:19,240
butts it's a whole another thing we'll

478
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:21,679
talk about a little bit I know I talked

479
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:25,240
about it before on one of the radio

480
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:29,360
shows but try to give you guys even

481
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:31,080
additional information if I can so so

482
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,559
there's all these things that sit inside

483
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:35,240
the liver make it sluggish make it

484
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:38,799
dysfunctional and the liver plays a role

485
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:40,480
more in thyroid symptoms than anything

486
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:43,720
else

487
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:46,320
almost that's what's unbelievable and

488
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:49,760
the liver plays a role in so much of our

489
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:52,840
gut health issues it is unbelievable how

490
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:55,720
much the liver liver plays a role in our

491
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:59,400
gut health issues when the liver

492
00:19:55,720 --> 00:20:02,679
weakens breaks down it gets sluggish it

493
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:04,480
gets stagnant and it can't produce the

494
00:20:02,679 --> 00:20:08,400
bile need

495
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:12,280
it it can't produce the bile the bile

496
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:16,240
strength the bile salt strength is

497
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:19,159
reduced so when that bile starts popping

498
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:21,400
out the

499
00:20:19,159 --> 00:20:24,480
gallbladder and it starts popping out of

500
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:27,640
the gallbladder and it's getting down in

501
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:29,679
there and the small the the top of the

502
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,480
small intes track in the dadum in that

503
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:34,000
whole

504
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:37,400
area it's weak it's weaker it's weaker

505
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:40,400
bile fluid it's

506
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:41,640
weaker when it's weaker it can't break

507
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:45,320
down

508
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:47,240
fat so the fats go rans it to people on

509
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:48,559
a high fat diet there be a lot of e like

510
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:50,760
eating a lot of chicken which is high

511
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:52,880
fat doesn't matter if it's lean breast

512
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:54,080
with no skin on it's still high fat it's

513
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,799
just you know cuz that's the calorie

514
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,320
inside the chicken if they're eating too

515
00:20:55,799 --> 00:20:58,720
many nuts somebody who's eating too many

516
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:02,000
nuts you got a vegan eating too many

517
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:05,520
nuts way too many nuts and nut Butters

518
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:08,960
um way too much chocolate or whatever it

519
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:11,360
is then you got you get all that fat

520
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:14,600
that the B's having a difficulty break

521
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:17,279
down someone's eating lots of grass-fed

522
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:18,799
beef got all that fat in it doesn't I'm

523
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:20,360
not talking about brisket I'm not

524
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:22,600
talking about ribs I'm talking about

525
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:24,480
just the leanest cut you could find

526
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:27,919
still lots of fat in

527
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:29,480
there if someone's just you know I don't

528
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,159
know someone's eating tons of coconut

529
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:33,000
oil and lots of avocados too many

530
00:21:31,159 --> 00:21:35,279
avocados they're eating six eight

531
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,679
avocados a day people do that and and

532
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:38,919
it's a good healthy

533
00:21:36,679 --> 00:21:41,520
food and look if you're in the animal

534
00:21:38,919 --> 00:21:44,279
protein yeah lean grass-fed beef is the

535
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:46,679
the safest way to go but all these fats

536
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:49,120
what they do they're hard to hard to

537
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:51,440
break down see I don't I don't I don't

538
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:53,880
stick myself to a belief system Spirit

539
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:56,799
told me a long time ago if you fall into

540
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:58,360
one belief system I'm done with you

541
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:59,679
spirit said Spirit was kidding Spirit

542
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,799
has a sense of humor you have to have a

543
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:04,039
sense of

544
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:06,320
humor you have to have a spir a sense of

545
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:07,480
humor I've actually asked Spirit about

546
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,720
that along the way I said why do you

547
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:12,919
have a sense of humor spirit Spirit said

548
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,480
that you know that truly tapped in joy

549
00:22:12,919 --> 00:22:17,279

00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,840
truly tra tapped in love that truly that

551
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:21,240
true true

552
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:23,840
place there's humor there's joy and

553
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:26,840
humor with it there's lighthearted

554
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:29,760
nature in in in it and spirit said look

555
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:32,039
you can't get this Bel system and you

556
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:34,640
can't just stay with this one belief

557
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:37,799
system and you get stuck in that and

558
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:40,400
then you can't help everybody you just

559
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:42,720
help some people because part of that

560
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,720
belief system is good like there's no

561
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,480
processed

562
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:48,840
foods everybody's adopted that at this

563
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,279
point so then you do help somebody you

564
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,679
help somebody that's on a fast food diet

565
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:53,880
to get off fast food diet to eat a

566
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:56,120
certain way doesn't mean it's the right

567
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:59,279
way entirely for their conditions so you

568
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:01,600
can't fall into a belief system right

569
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:02,720
and so I can't do that I'm not allowed

570
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,400
to do

571
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:07,840
that and I wanted to fall into a belief

572
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:09,799
system badly just like anybody would or

573
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:13,159
any practitioner or any healer whatever

574
00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:15,799
I wanted to Spirit wouldn't let me kept

575
00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:17,880
me on my toes to make sure you get the

576
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:20,720
right information I wanted to believe

577
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:22,120
candida was really bad I wanted that I

578
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:25,120
mean that's what I wanted like yeah

579
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:27,200
candida no spirit said no you kill all

580
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,720
your candida you die you can't live

581
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,840
without Candida

582
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:34,120
candida allows absorption of nutrients

583
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:36,919
to get into the bloodstream to allows no

584
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:39,039
that's that's the osmosis machine that

585
00:23:36,919 --> 00:23:41,919
candida is your

586
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:43,320
lifeline we're not told that candida

587
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:45,919
gets out of control it grows because

588
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:47,840
you're dumping so much because okay okay

589
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:52,600
this is a good point right here that I

590
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:54,919
got to connect is the bile salts get so

591
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:56,880
weak from the liver from the liver

592
00:23:54,919 --> 00:24:00,640
breaking down with all this

593
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:02,799
garbage that the bile salts weaken can't

594
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,480
break down the fats fats get rancid they

595
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:06,960
go into the intestinal tract and guess

596
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:09,559
what feeds off of it

597
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:11,640
bacteria so candida has to step up its

598
00:24:09,559 --> 00:24:13,159
game it has to say no no no no you can't

599
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:15,480
do that I don't want strepa cacus

600
00:24:13,159 --> 00:24:19,480
feeding off all this and creating sio

601
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:21,840
yes I don't want uh stakus feeding off

602
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:23,720
of all this rancid fat that can't break

603
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,760
down enough and rancid protein that

604
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:28,919
can't break down

605
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:33,039
enough I don't want that being fed to

606
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:35,720
strepa coasy koi seiff staff I don't

607
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:39,159
want it being fed to Epstein bar to

608
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:42,640
shingles variety number

609
00:24:39,159 --> 00:24:46,000
21 a non-r rashing one I don't

610
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:48,159
want this being fed to all that so

611
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,080
candid is programmed programmed by

612
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:52,919
something above our

613
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:56,120
bodies up in the atmosphere up in the

614
00:24:52,919 --> 00:24:57,520
heavens up up high candida has a message

615
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:00,520
being delivered to it all the time it

616
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:02,919
has a the will to keep you alive so

617
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:04,720
it'll rise up and it'll grow and then

618
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:06,000
some somebody's going to say oh you got

619
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,919
your candid is out of control that's

620
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,960
your problem we have to kill off your

621
00:25:06,919 --> 00:25:10,399
candid to no the problem is we have to

622
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,840
stop

623
00:25:10,399 --> 00:25:14,360
feeding some of these bad bacteria and

624
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:16,200
other things that create sibo and

625
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:18,399
everything because candid is trying to

626
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:20,600
save the day it's trying to eat all that

627
00:25:18,399 --> 00:25:22,039
food so it ends up growing more and more

628
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:24,320
because it's trying to eat all that bad

629
00:25:22,039 --> 00:25:26,440
food that's rancid and not breaking down

630
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:29,360
so it could save your

631
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:30,679
butt so but I wanted a belief system

632
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:32,640
when I was younger I'd be like Oh

633
00:25:30,679 --> 00:25:34,760
Candida spirit said yeah well I want to

634
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,919
tell you about this fungus like oh

635
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:38,760
fungus is bad bad no and spirit's like

636
00:25:36,919 --> 00:25:41,520
don't fall into a belief so you have to

637
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:44,720
understand what this does no matter what

638
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:47,480
information lies out there so I can't

639
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:50,640
look at information I can't ever I can't

640
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:53,080
I can't read books and that I get

641
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:55,320
polluted because that information's been

642
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:59,240
polluted somewhere or originally

643
00:25:55,320 --> 00:26:01,080
wherever it came from and so in order to

644
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:04,760
keep the stuff pure and clean so it

645
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:07,200
comes to you pure and clean untampered

646
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:10,960
with so that's how candida works so when

647
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:14,240
the liver gets sluggish and breaks

648
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:16,600
down and gets weaker it's still your

649
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,720
hero your liver is still your hero you

650
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:21,840
got to love your liver you have to love

651
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:24,159
it but it's still your hero that's not

652
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:25,640
your thyroid that's not your thyroid

653
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:27,799
causing the symptoms that's not your

654
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:30,640
thyroid causing the constipation that's

655
00:26:27,799 --> 00:26:32,200
not your thyroid causing brain fog

656
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:34,399
difficulty concentrating those are

657
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:37,080
poisons and

658
00:26:34,399 --> 00:26:38,760
toxins those are poisons and toxins

659
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:40,360
coming from other things like for

660
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:42,120
instance brain fog that's that's a

661
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:44,720
symptom from Epstein bar that's a

662
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:46,840
symptoms that's a symptom from

663
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,840
neurotoxins floating around in the

664
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:50,679
bloodstream produced by a virus and the

665
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:53,440
liver has a lot of neurotoxins in it

666
00:26:50,679 --> 00:26:55,760
from a virus like Epstein bar it just so

667
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:59,440
happens you may also have a thyroid

668
00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:03,399
problem too eventually

669
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:05,960
and thyroid healing explains why because

670
00:27:03,399 --> 00:27:09,279
the thyroid becomes a victim another

671
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:13,399
victim another Target for something like

672
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:16,480
Epstein bar but originally the the brain

673
00:27:13,399 --> 00:27:18,480
fog is from pollutants from the liver

674
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:20,320
weakening from it having something going

675
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:23,720
on in it in

676
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:25,840
it and the difficulty

677
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:27,840
concentrating it's also you know heavy

678
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:29,960
metals oxidize and they're in the liver

679
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,720
they oxidize and they're they can be in

680
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:33,440
the brain too and oxidize and then

681
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:35,760
viruses such as the epine bar can feed

682
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:38,200
off of the heavy metals and create more

683
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:40,159
neurotoxins and then more brain fog but

684
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:41,480
then you go to the doctor they see also

685
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:44,080
something that's low on the numbers of

686
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:46,679
the thyroid and then boom you got a

687
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:49,320
thyroid diagnosis connecting to that

688
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:50,720
symptom and that's that's not Advanced

689
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:53,240
enough I got to tell you that's still

690
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:55,480
years behind that's still Antiquity

691
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:57,880
Antiquity compared to what we're we're

692
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:59,320
delivering to you guys I'm on saying

693
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:01,039
that because I'm boasting I'm saying

694
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:03,960
that because you got to have the right

695
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:07,440
info you don't want the wrong

696
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:09,640
info I can't tell you how many people

697
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:12,880
who met me along the way said if I only

698
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:15,799
had this information 20 years

699
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:17,799
ago where were you they said to me I

700
00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:20,519
said oh I was giving this information 20

701
00:28:17,799 --> 00:28:23,480
years ago I was giving that information

702
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:25,760
25 years ago even more even further I

703
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:27,760
was doing it I just didn't meet you you

704
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:32,159
had no way of knowing how to get to me

705
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:32,159
at that time but it was

706
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:36,320
there and when you when you have this

707
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:39,240
information you have knowledge you only

708
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:40,720
strengthen from it and you only heal

709
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:42,480
from

710
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,480
it

711
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,519
so

712
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,840
constipation happens is when all these

713
00:28:46,519 --> 00:28:50,399
fats they don't break down good enough

714
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:52,039
all that protein doesn't break down good

715
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:53,279
enough and the protein won't break down

716
00:28:52,039 --> 00:28:56,399
good enough because your hydrochloric

717
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:58,799
acid levels go down they weaken in the

718
00:28:56,399 --> 00:29:01,640
stomach

719
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:04,080
hydrochloric acid weakens in the stomach

720
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:07,760
hydrochloric acid weakens in the

721
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:10,640
stomach then gastric juices

722
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:12,480
weaken gastric juices weaken gastric

723
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:17,279
juices weaken we get in trouble then

724
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:21,440
protein doesn't break down good and that

725
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:24,799
rots in the small intestinal tract feed

726
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:27,720
sibo which is strepa cacus sibo is not

727
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:32,559
just you if if you haven't heard my CBO

728
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:35,159
show sibo isn't just okay that's the

729
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:37,240
label that's what it is practitioners

730
00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:41,080
don't know sibo is

731
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:43,960
mostly strep they don't know that strep

732
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:47,000
is the dominant bacteria that creates

733
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:48,559
sibo that's the one that's the one that

734
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,320
camps out that's the one that does the

735
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:52,840
most that's the that's the sibo

736
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:56,600
Creator

737
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:59,840
so you got rotting protein going down

738
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:02,279
into the small intestinal tract and into

739
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:04,799
the into the colon you got rotting

740
00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:10,000
protein going down in there you got

741
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:13,480
rancid putrid fat going down so your B's

742
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,480
weak it's not breaking down the

743
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:19,399
fats your Hydrochloric acid's weak it's

744
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:22,399
not breaking down the

745
00:30:19,399 --> 00:30:24,240
proteins you get a Feeding Frenzy it's

746
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:26,399
like being on a boat and throwing a

747
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,760
whole bunch of chum is that what it is

748
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:30,679
Chum

749
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:32,240
it's called Chum I think you throw a

750
00:30:30,679 --> 00:30:37,200
whole bunch of chum in the

751
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:39,200
water buckets of it blood guts fish guts

752
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:41,200
you know fish heads just throw it in the

753
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:44,120
water and then all of a sudden you

754
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:46,320
know 20 minutes later you just see a fin

755
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:48,559
of a

756
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,919
shark now that's what it's like you know

757
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:51,360
when this stuff drops into the small

758
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:53,000
intestinal tract you get this Feeding

759
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:55,679
Frenzy and this Feeding Frenzy can go on

760
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,799
for years before you even get a sio

761
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:59,799
diagnosis it but you could be getting

762
00:30:57,799 --> 00:31:01,360
constipation in between it and and out

763
00:30:59,799 --> 00:31:03,639
of it you may get constipation just

764
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:06,480
later on not even

765
00:31:03,639 --> 00:31:09,240
yet

766
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:11,720
and so as the bacteria is eating the

767
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:13,320
food then you been the new thing now

768
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:14,919
because I even think practitioners are

769
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:16,480
kind of forgetting about candida they

770
00:31:14,919 --> 00:31:18,080
kind of know that there's holes in that

771
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,559
one so now they're just everybody's

772
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:22,519
getting a sibo

773
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:24,000
diagnosis so they're getting sibo

774
00:31:22,519 --> 00:31:25,799
diagnosis you got a gut problem with

775
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,639
sibo you got a gut problem with sibo you

776
00:31:25,799 --> 00:31:30,080
no you got a gut problem with stress

777
00:31:27,639 --> 00:31:33,080
it's other bugs it's strap but mostly

778
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:35,360
strap eating eating and

779
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:37,200
eating you can't eat is just trying to

780
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:39,080
protect you trying to trying to save you

781
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,559
but this can cause this can cause

782
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:42,200
problems all of it can cause problems

783
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:43,919
meaning you get the constipation you

784
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:47,679
could get eventually inflamation from

785
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:49,320
strep growing outgrowing the

786
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:52,399
candida and then you get the

787
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:55,880
constipation then you get diagnosed with

788
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:55,880
IBS BS of

789
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:02,639
constipation bounce of constipation on

790
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:04,000
and off bloating gas go to another

791
00:32:02,639 --> 00:32:05,960
doctor and they're like you got

792
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,440
irritable bowel syndrome what does that

793
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:09,919
mean I don't know maybe you got celiac

794
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:13,080
disease what does that mean oh

795
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:15,720
autoimmune that's wrong too it's not

796
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:18,480
autoimmune that's wrong Celiac isn't

797
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:21,159
your body destroying itself that's a

798
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:23,320
massive mistake you know there's a

799
00:32:21,159 --> 00:32:25,639
chapter well no there's a set of

800
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:27,919
chapters in thyroid

801
00:32:25,639 --> 00:32:32,559
healing and

802
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:35,639
you know when you when you read this set

803
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:39,760
of chapters I think it's

804
00:32:35,639 --> 00:32:41,360
like I don't know 12 or 13 14 chapters

805
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:43,960
on the great mistakes and one of the

806
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:46,720
greatest mistakes is autoimmune blaming

807
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:49,080
the body for destroying itself

808
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,360
Celiac is now considered the body

809
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:53,159
destroying

810
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:55,279
itself body attacking itself body

811
00:32:53,159 --> 00:32:57,919
attacking the colon body attacking

812
00:32:55,279 --> 00:33:01,880
organs body attack you know the

813
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:04,639
intestinal tract so that's where celiac

814
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:05,960
disease headed and that's where down

815
00:33:04,639 --> 00:33:07,639
that's where it is

816
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:12,200
now

817
00:33:07,639 --> 00:33:13,799
um so it's not the body attacking itself

818
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:17,240
it's not at

819
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:19,600
all Celiac first of all gluten is a

820
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:22,880
trigger the reason why gluten is a

821
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:26,320
trigger is it it feeds streps it's one

822
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:27,960
of streps favorite foods chronic strep

823
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:30,399
where did you getron strip well if you

824
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:32,279
have it in your system at your childhood

825
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:34,080
and if you've taken any antibiotics in

826
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:35,600
your childhood or throughout your life

827
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:37,279
those antibiotics just you know

828
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:39,559
strengthen the strep up along the way

829
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:42,279
that's how it works for all of

830
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:45,679
us well that could lead to sibo that can

831
00:33:42,279 --> 00:33:47,360
lead to just plain old symptoms IBS it

832
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:49,240
can lead to

833
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:51,880
Celiac and then when you get something

834
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:53,600
like Epstein bar in in the system and in

835
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:55,320
the liver slowing down the liver and

836
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:57,360
doing other things and the Celiac

837
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:59,480
symptoms can get worse because the liver

838
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:02,159
gets

839
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:04,279
worse the liver if the liver's sluggish

840
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:07,159
and slow the bile doesn't break down the

841
00:34:04,279 --> 00:34:09,040
fats if your Hydrochloric acid's low the

842
00:34:07,159 --> 00:34:11,000
proteins don't break down your Celiac

843
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:13,119
can get worse you eat one piece of white

844
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,200
bread your Celiac flares up because the

845
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:16,720
strep is flaring up meaning the strep is

846
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:19,280
getting a Feeding Frenzy you have a

847
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:22,159
piece of cheese over a neighbor's house

848
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:24,879
and then 3 Days Later your Celiac is

849
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:27,240
up it's not the body attacking itself

850
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:29,919
this is another great mistake great mist

851
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:33,679
stake so that's how Celiac works it's a

852
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:36,359
little touch about it

853
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:37,960
um hydrochloric acid isn't just one

854
00:34:36,359 --> 00:34:40,359
blend science and research hasn't

855
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:42,399
discovered that it's a blend of seven

856
00:34:40,359 --> 00:34:45,240
and you can have three out of that seven

857
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:46,800
below but one out of that seven be high

858
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:48,320
and that's all they can do they can get

859
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:51,480
a false reading oh you got good enough

860
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:53,800
hydrochloric acid because because they

861
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:55,040
don't know what they're looking for if

862
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:58,079
science and

863
00:34:55,040 --> 00:35:00,040
research hasn't doesn't know something

864
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:02,720
exists they haven't developed a test to

865
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:05,440
find it so then it's not on the

866
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:07,960
radar that's how it works same thing

867
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:09,640
with the two undiscovered hormones

868
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:12,000
that's in the thyroid healing book those

869
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:13,640
two undiscovered hormones that I brought

870
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,760
to the table in that book for the first

871
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:17,680
time in history I think you're going to

872
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:20,200
really appreciate because when you read

873
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:22,320
about what these do it's unbelievable

874
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:23,760
what they do but science of research

875
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,720
doesn't know they exist because they

876
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,200
haven't they don't know what they're

877
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,520
looking for they have developed a test

878
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:29,800
that's not how

879
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:31,520
it's not science of research stumbles

880
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:33,160
across things they don't know what

881
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:34,640
they're ever looking for with anything

882
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:36,359
going all the way back that's how this

883
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:38,240
is just how it works and I've had

884
00:35:36,359 --> 00:35:40,160
scientists tell me this tell me that

885
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:41,320
they just it's all about stumbling

886
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:44,040
across

887
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:47,000
things that's how it is it's if you're

888
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:49,240
lucky to stumble across

889
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,599
something that's that's how research and

890
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:52,640
science

891
00:35:50,599 --> 00:35:55,760
works you know

892
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:57,680
and and so they haven't stumbled across

893
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,960
the other two hormones of thyroid has

894
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:01,520
they're too comfortable with thinking

895
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:04,440
they've already figured it out so

896
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:05,880
they're not even going to look in hopes

897
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:10,119
to

898
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:12,440
stumble so

899
00:36:10,119 --> 00:36:14,560
um they haven't stumbled across the

900
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:17,160
seven blend of the hydrochloric

901
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:20,960
acid so that's that's what I'm trying to

902
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:24,800
say I don't want to tail off on tail off

903
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:27,400
to Never Never Never Land but what

904
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:29,040
happens is that with the hydrochloric

905
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:30,720
acid if you have a few of the different

906
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:33,040
blend that's

907
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:34,400
weakened it's not going to do its thing

908
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:36,200
it's first of all it's not going to kill

909
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,680
bugs the way it needs to kill bugs it's

910
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:39,720
not going to break down protein the way

911
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:42,119
it needs to break down protein so

912
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:44,440
protein's rot and they feed strep which

913
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:47,400
can get you any kind of diagnosis in the

914
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:49,880
end like IBS Celiac I mean it can get

915
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:52,200
you any kind overall it can get you a

916
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:55,680
Crohn's

917
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:58,359
diagnosis it could get you any kind of

918
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:01,400
diagnosis and that's how it works

919
00:36:58,359 --> 00:37:03,000
colitis is a virus in the shingles

920
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:05,040
family it's one of the viruses in the

921
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,720
shingles family there's over 30

922
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:09,240
varieties that we brought to the table

923
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:10,800
if you heard that somewhere else now

924
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:13,119
that's only because it came from me

925
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,880
originally so you know so you're not

926
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:17,520
like oh wait I heard that no no it came

927
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:21,760
from here it's important to know

928
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:24,760
that so you just so you know hey this is

929
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:26,800
how it works with kius colitis is a

930
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:29,760
shingles virus that inflames the light

931
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:31,480
in the inner Linings of the colon and

932
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:34,079
even can move up a little higher than

933
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:35,720
that to the small intestinal tract and

934
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:38,160
you can get the ruptures you can get you

935
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:39,720
know blood vessels can rupture and you

936
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:43,000
can also have it mild with there's no

937
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:45,240
there really mild mild blood vessel

938
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,800
rupturing but that's the shingles virus

939
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:50,200
causing

940
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:52,040
that but well you know that's thrown

941
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:53,359
into autoimmune 2 the body attacking

942
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:55,839
itself that's not the body attacking

943
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:57,240
itself creating colitis and inflammation

944
00:37:55,839 --> 00:38:01,800
there's a

945
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:05,119
pathogen the shingles virus creating

946
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:07,560
inflammation Celiac is not inflammation

947
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:10,920
created by the body attacking

948
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:15,359
itself the body's looking for a pathogen

949
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:16,560
the pathogen is INF flaming the lining

950
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:19,720
of the

951
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:22,000
colon that's how it works so important

952
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:25,800
to know so important to

953
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:27,160
know I mean you know if if someone I

954
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,839
mean

955
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:30,359
someone had the option you either know

956
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:32,800
the truth or you

957
00:38:30,359 --> 00:38:34,160
don't well actually that's not even a

958
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,359
good example to use there's people that

959
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:37,079
don't want to hear the truth they don't

960
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:38,880
want to know the truth there there's

961
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:40,760
there's plenty of them so I I mean you

962
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,200
might even know somebody I mean so

963
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:43,599
that's not even a good way of putting it

964
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:46,960
all I know is I would want to know the

965
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:51,599
right information in my life and I do no

966
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:55,359
matter what um okay so so let's go back

967
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:57,400
to some of this so leaky gut let's go

968
00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:59,920
back to leaky gut too

969
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:03,280
you know what happens is the liver

970
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:05,200
breaks down it's sluggish it's slow

971
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:07,839
nothing's working right the BS aren't

972
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:09,599
breaking down the fats hydrochloric acid

973
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:12,760
the seven blend that's undiscovered

974
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:15,119
isn't breaking down the protein properly

975
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:17,920
it's going in the gut it's

976
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:21,200
rotting and it's in there and what

977
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:25,280
creates is ammonia you got ammonia gas

978
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:27,280
ammonia gas is not leaky gut leaky gut

979
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:29,400
if someone had a leaky gut they'd be in

980
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:31,720
the hospital with 105 temperature and

981
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:33,960
sep sepsis starting they would actually

982
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:36,160
be in the

983
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:38,839
hospital what happens is when someone

984
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:40,480
gets a colonoscopy and they go and and

985
00:39:38,839 --> 00:39:42,760
and they get a puncture which happens

986
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:44,880
all the time and they get a puncture you

987
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:47,960
know the nurse practitioner or whoever

988
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:51,240
it is or the doctor um is is or the you

989
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:53,280
know is running up the running up the

990
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:55,319
camera you know with the wire and

991
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:57,839
running up the camera and it all of a

992
00:39:55,319 --> 00:39:59,040
sudden it gets snagged on a corner and

993
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:01,319
it

994
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:04,079
punctures as they're kind of driving it

995
00:40:01,319 --> 00:40:07,079
up there and it happens all the time

996
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:11,119
honestly the mild punctures are like one

997
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:15,319
out of 10 more severe ones are you know

998
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:17,400
probably uh 1 out of 15 one out of 20

999
00:40:15,319 --> 00:40:18,200
something like that and when you get

1000
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:20,520
that

1001
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:22,680
puncture you you think you're going to

1002
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:24,920
go home with that after that test and

1003
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:28,520
you may but you end up with this raging

1004
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:30,280
fever unbelievable pain absess growing

1005
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:32,440
in the colon and you're back in the

1006
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:35,040
hospital I've known people after the

1007
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:36,880
colon oopy I've known people that have

1008
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:41,200
had to sit in the hospital for 6 months

1009
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:43,319
after that baby just totally just 6

1010
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:45,640
months Ley

1011
00:40:43,319 --> 00:40:48,200
gut here's an example if you get

1012
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:50,880
diverticulosis and you got those

1013
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:52,880
pockets and when those Pockets even leak

1014
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:55,800
the slightest bit because they get so

1015
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:57,400
bad the pockets get so bad and and and

1016
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:59,280
they rupture these little pockets and

1017
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:02,440
there's lots of strap and ecoli in these

1018
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:05,520
little pockets and they rupture so bad

1019
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:07,960
that when when even any anything gets on

1020
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:11,040
the other side of that colon you got a

1021
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:11,040
fever and you're in the

1022
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:18,680
hospital there's no having leaky

1023
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:20,319
gut be your condition unless you're

1024
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:22,599
literally suffering and you're ending up

1025
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:25,240
in the hospital with that fever and that

1026
00:41:22,599 --> 00:41:28,000
sickness so the leaky gut hole thing is

1027
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:30,359
off totally off totally off I can't even

1028
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,880
go I mean I can't even it's so I talked

1029
00:41:30,359 --> 00:41:34,720
about it in book

1030
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:35,920
one but ammonia gas builds up with

1031
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:37,359
everything I told you about how the

1032
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:40,960
liver works and how nothing's breaking

1033
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:44,760
down and how everything goes rancid and

1034
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:46,720
and I told you that was telling you that

1035
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:50,280
that's the ammonia gas builds off of

1036
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:54,119
that rancidity that rancid those

1037
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:56,040
rancid pieces of food rancid fat the

1038
00:41:54,119 --> 00:41:58,920
liver collects as much as if it it is as

1039
00:41:56,040 --> 00:42:00,800
it can out of the bloodstream and the

1040
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:02,560
liver becomes fatty because it's trying

1041
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:06,000
to save you in different

1042
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:07,400
ways but it it's all going down into the

1043
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,319
intestinal tract and there's a Feeding

1044
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:14,359
Frenzy going on on top of it and and and

1045
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:16,520
and gases are produced from The Feeding

1046
00:42:14,359 --> 00:42:18,760
Frenzy and not only that though the

1047
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:21,280
rancid nature most importantly the

1048
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:24,760
rancid nature of the food because of the

1049
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:27,319
weak gut releases a gas that gas is

1050
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:29,200
ammonia ammonia isn't leaky gut it has

1051
00:42:27,319 --> 00:42:32,920
ghostlike qualities it can go through a

1052
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:35,920
bone ammonia can go through a

1053
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:39,000
bone literally goes through your bones

1054
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:41,640
it can pass through you and out of your

1055
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,720
skin like a ghost walking through a

1056
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:46,960
castle and going right through

1057
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:49,040
Stone right through Stone so ammonia

1058
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:50,920
just literally it can go through

1059
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:52,319
everything it's not about just going

1060
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:54,119
through the lining of the colon or the

1061
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:55,680
intestinal tract guys it's not about

1062
00:42:54,119 --> 00:42:58,440
that and into the bloodstream and make

1063
00:42:55,680 --> 00:43:01,880
you sick and it doesn't necessarily make

1064
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:04,359
you that sick when it even enters in the

1065
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:07,640
bloodstream so it's called ammonia

1066
00:43:04,359 --> 00:43:10,200
permeability but what it does is it can

1067
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:12,800
go through bones it can go through your

1068
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:14,359
teeth it it'll just go through you just

1069
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:17,000
right through you and out whatever part

1070
00:43:14,359 --> 00:43:17,960
of the skin it's going to go out that's

1071
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,160
what this

1072
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:21,640
does and and it's not good for you and

1073
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:25,400
it's not healthy for

1074
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:28,079
you but that's that's really as about as

1075
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:30,319
extent of Le gut as you can go and it's

1076
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:32,680
not leaky gut that's not leaky gut

1077
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:34,839
ammonia permeability is not really leaky

1078
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:36,800
gut at all because there's nothing

1079
00:43:34,839 --> 00:43:39,240
leaking out of your gut because ammonia

1080
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:41,040
will will leak through anything it'll go

1081
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:42,960
through anything in the body there's

1082
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:45,319
nothing that can stop it not an organ

1083
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:47,480
nothing it just goes through it has a

1084
00:43:45,319 --> 00:43:49,160
pass to go through everything in every

1085
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:51,599
crevice and drive through every single

1086
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:53,720
cell there is to get out of your

1087
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:55,960
body well that's what it

1088
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:57,440
does even when the liver tries to be

1089
00:43:55,960 --> 00:44:00,319
that that hero like it is and try to

1090
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:04,480
collect it and gather it and and and and

1091
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:06,160
suck it up it just goes right through it

1092
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:10,040
again

1093
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:12,920
so um so as far as the leaky gut thing

1094
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:15,559
no no no no but there's

1095
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:16,960
neurotoxins that are a different kind of

1096
00:44:15,559 --> 00:44:18,119
poison that get into the bloodstream

1097
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:19,319
that are in the bloodstream and they get

1098
00:44:18,119 --> 00:44:22,480
in the bloodstream from the liver and

1099
00:44:19,319 --> 00:44:25,240
they account for so many symptoms that

1100
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:27,119
are being bagged into thyroid it's

1101
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:28,440
unbelievable right now everything's

1102
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:30,119
being bagged into thyroid chronic

1103
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:31,280
fatigue syndrome oh it's your thyroid

1104
00:44:30,119 --> 00:44:32,839
after all so that's what they're all

1105
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:35,000
trying to do now that's what the experts

1106
00:44:32,839 --> 00:44:38,319
are trying to do now I can't tell you

1107
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:40,240
how off this is it's not on at all it's

1108
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:44,079
not in your favor it's not on it's not

1109
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:45,760
real what happens is that when when you

1110
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:47,920
now chronic fatigue syndrome gets thrown

1111
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:49,319
into the thyroid problem or it'll go get

1112
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:50,760
thrown into Lyme disease one or the

1113
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:51,960
other and everybody with lime disase has

1114
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:54,200
thyroid problems and now they're all

1115
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:56,599
confused thinking okay maybe it's a

1116
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:59,800
thyroid problem in the end now too

1117
00:44:56,599 --> 00:45:01,480
but it's not it's just chronic fatigue

1118
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:04,520
your chronic fatigue or somebody's

1119
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:06,880
chronic fatigue is is another symptom

1120
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:08,920
that's Epstein bar creating that your

1121
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:10,480
thyroid being off for not doing that

1122
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:13,559
good it's a whole another symptom it's a

1123
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:15,319
whole another thing going on it's

1124
00:45:13,559 --> 00:45:17,760
separate

1125
00:45:15,319 --> 00:45:19,000
separate it's not the thyroid creating

1126
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:21,040
the

1127
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:23,640
fatigue even

1128
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:26,640
if I mean I know people missing their

1129
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:28,400
thyroids they have no fatigue

1130
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:31,960
I know people missing their

1131
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:35,720
thyroids that are not even on

1132
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:35,720
medication that don't have

1133
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:42,839
fatigue so I mean there's so many holes

1134
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:45,079
in the trendy theories that they're just

1135
00:45:42,839 --> 00:45:48,680
trying to all bag up right

1136
00:45:45,079 --> 00:45:51,760
now so anyway let's see if we can talk

1137
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:54,599
about some more stuff puffy face puffy

1138
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:56,400
eyes that's liver and lymphatic system

1139
00:45:54,599 --> 00:46:00,079
it's not

1140
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:01,680
it's not you know just the thyroid

1141
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:04,920
that's not the

1142
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:06,480
thyroid now with hyperthyroid you can

1143
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:09,640
get the bulging eyes that's different

1144
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:11,839
than puffy eyes puffy puffy face puffy

1145
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:14,160
eyes puffy face gets thrown into

1146
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:16,760
hypothyroid no it's just that somebody

1147
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:19,280
with hypothyroid also has a really

1148
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:23,480
really toxic sluggish liver and

1149
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:25,880
lymphatic system the that's how it

1150
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:30,240
works oh what's the symptoms of hypo

1151
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:33,839
thyroid oh puffy eyes um puffy face um

1152
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:36,640
no no no

1153
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:38,720
no it just so happens somebody has a

1154
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:40,559
thyroid problem too but they also the

1155
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:42,200
liver and lymphatic system is creating

1156
00:46:40,559 --> 00:46:45,319
puffy eyes puffy face because someone

1157
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:49,359
else can have a thyroid problem all the

1158
00:46:45,319 --> 00:46:52,559
same with no puffy eyes puffy

1159
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:54,520
face I mean honestly honestly you guys

1160
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:56,559
you wouldn't I mean why isn't anybody

1161
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:58,319
even focusing

1162
00:46:56,559 --> 00:47:01,880
out there

1163
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:04,160
and figuring this out yet cuz they're

1164
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:05,760
not going to we have to do it and you

1165
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:07,839
have to be the expert and we have to do

1166
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:09,760
it spirit said to me a long ago you have

1167
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:11,520
to do it I said I don't want to do it

1168
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:14,720
there says no you have to do it I picked

1169
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:16,280
you I I go I don't want to do it I don't

1170
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:18,319
I don't care when I was younger I was

1171
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:20,359
like I don't care I just want to have

1172
00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:23,480
fun or do something

1173
00:47:20,359 --> 00:47:27,040
else and spirit says no no no you have

1174
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:30,800
to care you're the one why am I the one

1175
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:32,480
spirit said because you're pretty tough

1176
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,559
I God no I'm not tough spirit says yeah

1177
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:35,200
you're pretty tough you're going to

1178
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:37,920
survive this you're going to fight for

1179
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:40,640
it and survive it and I had to and it

1180
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:42,200
was no fun so but we're here we're here

1181
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:45,040
so anyway

1182
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:48,040
um says puffy eyes puffy face how it

1183
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:50,160
works bulging eyes for

1184
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:52,480
hyperthyroid that's because fluid

1185
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:56,760
retention goes right behind the

1186
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:58,359
eyes that right there is is viral the

1187
00:47:56,760 --> 00:48:03,319
same virus that creates

1188
00:47:58,359 --> 00:48:05,359
hyperthyroidism um edema so edema edema

1189
00:48:03,319 --> 00:48:07,119
fluid retention that's getting us if if

1190
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:09,200
a if a doctor can't find a kidney

1191
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:10,800
condition or a heart condition they

1192
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:14,160
associate that immediately with a

1193
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:16,920
thyroid or hypothyroid edem is a liver

1194
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:19,280
condition it's an undiagnosed liver

1195
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:21,400
condition which is part of the gut part

1196
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:23,760
of the guts well we're on gut health

1197
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:27,640
today so that's that's the you know part

1198
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:27,640
of the liver condition

1199
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:32,240
um so we talked about IBS a little bit

1200
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:35,160
but we can go into IBS a little bit more

1201
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:37,200
IBS is just just basically liver that's

1202
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:38,680
not functioning good an intestinal tract

1203
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:40,599
that doesn't have a healthy environment

1204
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:43,880
because it's got so much petrifying food

1205
00:48:40,599 --> 00:48:46,760
and and uh and putrifying fat and and

1206
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:48,720
rotting protein so and basically from

1207
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:50,599
poor digestion hydrochloric acid issues

1208
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:52,000
and then things like strepa cacus can

1209
00:48:50,599 --> 00:48:55,160
really get out of control and that's

1210
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:57,160
what IBS is um you can get swelling

1211
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:59,480
inside the the colon lots of swelling it

1212
00:48:57,160 --> 00:49:01,000
can get inflamed um you can have

1213
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:02,559
diarrhea and you can have constipation

1214
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:05,960
diarrhea constipation you could have

1215
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:08,319
parts of the colon elocal valve all that

1216
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:10,880
be um you could have this an inflamed

1217
00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:14,440
seeum you can have the ilocal valve

1218
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:17,040
being inflamed uh due to bacteria and

1219
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:20,079
inflammation because of bacteria that's

1220
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:22,160
uh IBS you can have even you could be

1221
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:24,520
viral and have a lot of viral toxins

1222
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:27,359
inside the intestinal tract that cause

1223
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:29,359
ibs2 as well they'll probably just say

1224
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:30,119
IBS is autoimmune down the road too

1225
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:31,400
because they're just going to have to

1226
00:49:30,119 --> 00:49:32,480
point to everything being the body

1227
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:33,680
destroying itself because they don't

1228
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:35,799
know what's wrong with anybody and

1229
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:37,520
that's what I talk about in thyroid

1230
00:49:35,799 --> 00:49:39,799
healing because they don't know what's

1231
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:41,400
wrong with anybody so they're just going

1232
00:49:39,799 --> 00:49:43,760
to point it out to being it's it's

1233
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:46,599
either your genes or your body's

1234
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:49,680
attacking itself excuse me going to

1235
00:49:46,599 --> 00:49:51,720
clear my throat here so

1236
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:53,079
um so that's what happens so

1237
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:55,200
everything's going to go to autoimmune

1238
00:49:53,079 --> 00:49:56,480
no matter what even CBO I mean sibo

1239
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:59,400
whatever even

1240
00:49:56,480 --> 00:50:01,599
IBS you know all of that's going to go

1241
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:03,880
there all of that's going to go there

1242
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:06,040
now you can have gastritis without

1243
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:07,839
having a lot of gas I want you to know

1244
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:11,839
this this is something I haven't talked

1245
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:14,319
about um anywhere too um so anybody with

1246
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:17,559
gastritis you may not get diagnosed with

1247
00:50:14,319 --> 00:50:20,520
gastritis but you can have gastritis it

1248
00:50:17,559 --> 00:50:23,079
depends on how toxic the gas is so you

1249
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:26,920
can have bloating and pain and not move

1250
00:50:23,079 --> 00:50:30,839
any gas but yet it's there you can have

1251
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:33,160
no bloating and sharp pains and it be

1252
00:50:30,839 --> 00:50:35,839
little tiny pockets of gas very little

1253
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:39,640
but the pocket of gas is so

1254
00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:42,200
toxic that literally it hurts the nerves

1255
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:45,319
so in your intestinal track and this is

1256
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:47,799
a secret here too and your intestinal

1257
00:50:45,319 --> 00:50:49,240
tra you've got you know all your nerves

1258
00:50:47,799 --> 00:50:51,359
go to your intestinal tra it's like your

1259
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:53,799
second brain it's kind of the second or

1260
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:56,799
third brain in the body so all your

1261
00:50:53,799 --> 00:50:59,599
nerves go to the intestin inal

1262
00:50:56,799 --> 00:51:01,119
track and um basically your intestinal

1263
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:02,880
tra is like a puppet with a whole bunch

1264
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:04,720
of strings attached to it somebody kind

1265
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:07,640
of dangling that you know dangling a

1266
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:10,240
puppet making it dance okay so the

1267
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:12,520
controller on top who's doing all that

1268
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:15,799
is the

1269
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:18,000
brain and the brain is is giving orders

1270
00:51:15,799 --> 00:51:20,920
nervous system is giving orders directly

1271
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:22,880
to every single every single spot in the

1272
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:26,119
intestinal tract and

1273
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:28,119
colon and um

1274
00:51:26,119 --> 00:51:30,280
so what you know so what's happening

1275
00:51:28,119 --> 00:51:32,000
there what's happening there is that

1276
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:33,920
there's so many nerves going on in there

1277
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,839
that have even even slightly inflamed in

1278
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:38,960
the colon or intestinal tract if

1279
00:51:35,839 --> 00:51:42,160
slightly inflamed if a little pocket of

1280
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:44,280
gas that happens to be very toxic from

1281
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:47,200
either you know some virus viruses or

1282
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:49,160
toxic coming you know you know basically

1283
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:52,599
the liver has so much poison in it or

1284
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:54,440
you got the too much bacteria sibo

1285
00:51:52,599 --> 00:51:56,559
creating bacteria like the strepa cacus

1286
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:58,520
going on and you get this little gas

1287
00:51:56,559 --> 00:52:01,160
bubble and that gas bubble's just moving

1288
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:03,599
around and it hits hot spots it hits hot

1289
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:06,119
nerves inflamed areas and when it hits a

1290
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:08,119
hot nerve oh man you got cramp you got

1291
00:52:06,119 --> 00:52:09,280
pain you got a sharp pain you got all

1292
00:52:08,119 --> 00:52:12,079
these different things but you don't

1293
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:16,040
even have to be releasing a lot of

1294
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:20,440
gas in order to have this type of

1295
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:23,480
gastritis so that's something to to uh

1296
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:25,559
Chomp into that's some information there

1297
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:27,040
I want to talk about insatiable hunger

1298
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:30,680
this is interesting because insatable

1299
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:33,280
hunger is being being thrown into

1300
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:34,839
hyperthyroid it's like a definitive

1301
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:37,119
symptom right now today of like

1302
00:52:34,839 --> 00:52:39,119
hyperthyroid insatable hunger now I know

1303
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:43,400
this isn't a hyperthyroid

1304
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:44,960
webinar but this is a gut health

1305
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:48,799
webinar

1306
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:51,520
so insatiable hunger is in the gut

1307
00:52:48,799 --> 00:52:54,359
health Arena even though it gets thrown

1308
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:56,440
into a mental disorder it gets thrown

1309
00:52:54,359 --> 00:52:59,640
into a mental disease it gets thrown

1310
00:52:56,440 --> 00:53:01,440
into some kind of okay I love when the a

1311
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:03,079
Theory comes out where it's like well no

1312
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:06,280
there's a shut off switch in the brain

1313
00:53:03,079 --> 00:53:08,040
and you're not producing a a a chemical

1314
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:10,079
that actually is supposed to do you know

1315
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:12,680
supposed to shut down your hunger I love

1316
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:16,400
when that that stuff happen starts to

1317
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:19,559
happen being sarcastic now we know that

1318
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:22,400
um but insatiable hunger gets totally

1319
00:53:19,559 --> 00:53:25,680
thrown into the basket of

1320
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:27,480
hyperthyroidism and the irony is is is

1321
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:29,119
there's more people insation hungry that

1322
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:31,839
have

1323
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:34,119
hypothyroidism the other irony is

1324
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:38,119
there's just as many people is

1325
00:53:34,119 --> 00:53:41,319
that that are insatiably hungry that

1326
00:53:38,119 --> 00:53:44,799
aren't dealing with a thyroid problem at

1327
00:53:41,319 --> 00:53:46,240
all but like I said it's it's got to go

1328
00:53:44,799 --> 00:53:49,880
somewhere if nobody knows what's going

1329
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:51,799
on with anybody if nobody knows what's

1330
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:54,040
going on anybody with anybody out there

1331
00:53:51,799 --> 00:53:56,640
you got to throw you got to knock the

1332
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:58,319
pull balls into one of the pockets so

1333
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:59,720
you know so the whole thing with

1334
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:02,040
insatable Hunger gets thrown into

1335
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:04,920
hyperthyroid now ins satiable hunger is

1336
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:07,280
a liver glucose deficiency so it's a

1337
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:10,040
glycogen storage deficiency in the liver

1338
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:11,480
so anybody who's just really hungry or a

1339
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:15,160
little bit more hungry than somebody

1340
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:16,520
else or too hungry people would think

1341
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:18,000
you know they can't get enough carbs

1342
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:21,599
they can't get enough anything they just

1343
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:23,520
they're always hungry that is or if they

1344
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:25,160
feel like they binge all the time you

1345
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:26,240
know or they have to binge or something

1346
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:27,680
then they go without food then they

1347
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:29,440
binge and it just there's just always

1348
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:31,599
this hunger that just takes over and

1349
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:34,000
they they can't put down a piece of food

1350
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:37,079
or something like that I mean whatever

1351
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:39,240
it is that they talk about out there

1352
00:54:37,079 --> 00:54:41,280
whatever that that's that what that is

1353
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:42,799
that's a glycogen glycogen is glucose

1354
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:44,119
that stores up in a liver in a good

1355
00:54:42,799 --> 00:54:46,680
liver and meaning in a liver that's

1356
00:54:44,119 --> 00:54:48,720
really strong and healthy it stores up

1357
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:49,799
and it sits in there so it stops ins

1358
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:51,839
satiable

1359
00:54:49,799 --> 00:54:53,839
hunger but what happens is when our

1360
00:54:51,839 --> 00:54:56,480
liers weaken once again due to the

1361
00:54:53,839 --> 00:54:58,880
process like talk the better

1362
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:01,440
earlier what happens you lose your

1363
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:03,400
glucose Storage storage your glucose

1364
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:06,520
storage goes away your glycogen storage

1365
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:09,799
starts to dissolve in the liver so then

1366
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:12,720
the message is the liver sending it out

1367
00:55:09,799 --> 00:55:14,119
of of insatiable hunger to try to get

1368
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:16,680
carbs back

1369
00:55:14,119 --> 00:55:18,200
in and a lot of times people don't just

1370
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:21,280
know how to do that they don't know how

1371
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:23,920
to just eat some potatoes and some you

1372
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:25,680
know fruits and other things like that

1373
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:28,039
instead they're eating eting all kinds

1374
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:29,319
of things which causes problem too

1375
00:55:28,039 --> 00:55:32,359
because if you're eating all kinds of

1376
00:55:29,319 --> 00:55:35,240
stuff the liver is too weak to kind of

1377
00:55:32,359 --> 00:55:37,240
break it all down the bile can't break

1378
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:41,119
you know break the fat down hydrochloric

1379
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:42,599
acid can't break down the protein and it

1380
00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:44,240
just becomes a hash Posh of different

1381
00:55:42,599 --> 00:55:46,000
things too much fat in the blood too

1382
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:48,319
much fat in the blood stops sugars from

1383
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:50,079
building up in the liver if you can't

1384
00:55:48,319 --> 00:55:53,280
build up sugar in the liver you can't

1385
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:55,319
get your glycogen storage back up to par

1386
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:57,240
inside the liver if you can't get your

1387
00:55:55,319 --> 00:55:59,680
glycogen storage back up the par inside

1388
00:55:57,240 --> 00:56:01,640
the liver then you get insatiable hunger

1389
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:04,480
then you keep on eating more and more

1390
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:07,319
Abominations of whatever you can

1391
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:10,799
find but really what the liver wants is

1392
00:56:07,319 --> 00:56:13,160
low fat the liver wants lowfat low fat

1393
00:56:10,799 --> 00:56:15,000
and low protein and what the liver

1394
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:18,000
really wants is lots of fruits lots of

1395
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:19,880
vegetables lots of fruits sweet potatoes

1396
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,760
winter squash things that have

1397
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:22,559
carbohydrates but it doesn't want all

1398
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:25,359
the

1399
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:26,960
fat this way can break the food down

1400
00:56:25,359 --> 00:56:29,680
better with the bile salt and the

1401
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:31,880
hydrochloric acid that's been weakened

1402
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:33,720
and then the sugars can actually fill

1403
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:35,319
the liver and all the fat in the blood

1404
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:38,039
won't get in the way because you won't

1405
00:56:35,319 --> 00:56:40,160
be eating so much heavy

1406
00:56:38,039 --> 00:56:42,319
fat and that's what takes care of

1407
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:47,440
insatiable

1408
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:49,839
hunger so that's another secret

1409
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:52,960
um well I mean we got so much to talk

1410
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:55,200
about I'm just I'm just kind of I'm in a

1411
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:58,200
place where do I want to go into be be

1412
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:59,920
cautious about some things we do for the

1413
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:01,240
intestinal tract do I want to go into

1414
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:02,119
that I think I want to go into that a

1415
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:05,039
little

1416
00:57:02,119 --> 00:57:06,920
bit okay sodium bicarbonate that's a

1417
00:57:05,039 --> 00:57:09,160
trend and everything what what I find

1418
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:10,440
about that when we eat that try to get

1419
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:12,520
that in the intestinal tract to make us

1420
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:14,480
either alkaline or drop down candid

1421
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:18,039
levels or whatever somebody just thinks

1422
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:19,359
of each day um you don't want to do the

1423
00:57:18,039 --> 00:57:21,119
sodium

1424
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:22,920
bicarbonate way too hard on the

1425
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:26,839
intestinal tract way too hard on the

1426
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:28,640
liver it's not a good thing to do so um

1427
00:57:26,839 --> 00:57:30,280
I would consider backing down on that if

1428
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:31,839
you know someone doing it or whatever

1429
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:34,480
just just you just don't want to do it

1430
00:57:31,839 --> 00:57:38,079
anymore um not good for the intestinal

1431
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:40,200
tract lining not good for good bacteria

1432
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:42,760
doesn't help good bacteria you don't

1433
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:44,319
want to injure your good bacteria so

1434
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:46,319
that's the whole thing so the whole you

1435
00:57:44,319 --> 00:57:47,799
know the whole I mean I've seen some

1436
00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:49,319
terrible things happen from sodium

1437
00:57:47,799 --> 00:57:51,079
bicarbonate I've seen people with the

1438
00:57:49,319 --> 00:57:52,880
worst Crohn's or the worst colitis

1439
00:57:51,079 --> 00:57:55,000
actually take that stuff and literally

1440
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:58,920
end up in the hospital it's not not

1441
00:57:55,000 --> 00:58:01,000
smart I've seen even worse happen to

1442
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:04,599
people who've taken dious Earth

1443
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:07,200
particles um look the one thing about

1444
00:58:04,599 --> 00:58:10,319
picking on a product or picking on

1445
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:13,000
something is you know I get people angry

1446
00:58:10,319 --> 00:58:15,720
I understand that but I also have to

1447
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:17,599
watch your back um I'd stay away from

1448
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:20,799
diet Tous Earth particles because it's

1449
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:23,119
too harsh on the intestinal Linings and

1450
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:25,920
it tends to saturate the Linings and not

1451
00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:27,960
leave meaning it leaves eventually it

1452
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:31,760
just takes too long to leave so it

1453
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:34,839
Smothers it suffocates good bacteria on

1454
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:38,319
the lining it also creates malabsorption

1455
00:58:34,839 --> 00:58:40,480
too much dious Earth particles stop

1456
00:58:38,319 --> 00:58:42,880
absorption does it doesn't even allow

1457
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:44,720
candida to absorb for you properly it

1458
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:47,240
doesn't even allow your body to absorb

1459
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:49,280
properly so dious Earth particles was a

1460
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:51,640
really bad Trend in a really bad fad

1461
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:53,799
it's just that what happens is you know

1462
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:55,120
once these things get rolling there

1463
00:58:53,799 --> 00:58:56,640
ain't no stopp

1464
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:57,960
[Laughter]

1465
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:59,599
once these things get rolling there

1466
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:02,119
ain't no stopping I don't know what else

1467
00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:03,880
to say out there you know um so I would

1468
00:59:02,119 --> 00:59:07,400
avoid diet tomas's Earth particles since

1469
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:09,000
we're talking about gut health and um I

1470
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:10,920
didn't want to forget that if you've

1471
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:13,200
already taken it fine whatever just stop

1472
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:15,880
taking it okay some people feel okay

1473
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:17,799
with it some people you know I find that

1474
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:20,280
women they're the ones that get the

1475
00:59:17,799 --> 00:59:22,760
sickest from it uh men who don't have

1476
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:25,200
intestinal tract problems they can tend

1477
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:28,280
to do it not really feel a difference

1478
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:31,480
they don't know it's all good whatever

1479
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:33,839
but um but if a guy has a really bad

1480
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:35,640
intestinal tract problem that it will be

1481
00:59:33,839 --> 00:59:38,039
bad I've seen people get sick that way

1482
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:40,319
guys get sick women get way sicker from

1483
00:59:38,039 --> 00:59:42,480
it um way sicker from it I've seen some

1484
00:59:40,319 --> 00:59:47,000
terrible things happen so just hold off

1485
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:49,799
diet tomus Earth particles as a remedy

1486
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:53,760
as a detoxification method or

1487
00:59:49,799 --> 00:59:58,480
remedy which leads me to Clays Clays

1488
00:59:53,760 --> 01:00:01,599
clays CL l a y right clay I think that's

1489
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:05,000
how you spell clay clay isn't a good

1490
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:07,599
thing either so Clay is way too harsh

1491
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:10,000
way too abrasive like sandpaper on

1492
01:00:07,599 --> 01:00:12,319
intestinal Linings you don't want to

1493
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:14,359
sandpaper your intestinal Linings when

1494
01:00:12,319 --> 01:00:16,119
your nervous system delivers messages

1495
01:00:14,359 --> 01:00:17,480
down to your intestinal tract and your

1496
01:00:16,119 --> 01:00:21,119
intestinal

1497
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:24,920
tract is now doing the peristaltic

1498
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:27,400
action it's it's trying to move that

1499
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:31,280
clay and then Foods going down grabbing

1500
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:33,640
onto that clay and rubbing it on the

1501
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:35,880
sides of the intestinal tract rubbing it

1502
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:38,160
on the sides of the intestinal tract so

1503
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:39,640
you're getting clay like sandpaper fine

1504
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:42,640
sandp paper you know there's something

1505
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:44,160
called bonami bonami or something I

1506
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:45,960
don't know if if you have to say it in a

1507
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:47,559
fresh in a French way I think it's you

1508
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:49,960
know I don't know if it's a French word

1509
01:00:47,559 --> 01:00:53,280
or whatever right bone bonami whatever I

1510
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:55,559
don't know bone Amy that stuff in a can

1511
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:58,039
right you know that's I take that stuff

1512
01:00:55,559 --> 01:01:00,160
and I I like that stuff don't eat it I'm

1513
01:00:58,039 --> 01:01:02,280
not talking about eating it I take the

1514
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:06,520
can and I put it in the sink and I scrub

1515
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:08,880
out the sink it's a fine fine fine

1516
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:10,839
powder it's a fine

1517
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:12,319
powder you know I'll throw it in the

1518
01:01:10,839 --> 01:01:14,720
toilet and I'll scrub out the toilet the

1519
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:18,680
toilet toilet brush with that

1520
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:21,079
stuff and it doesn't feel gritty it

1521
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:22,960
doesn't feel like sandpaper at all feels

1522
01:01:21,079 --> 01:01:24,960
really smooth for some reason when you

1523
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:26,920
put it in your fingers and you rub it

1524
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:31,559
together it's like super smooth it's

1525
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:34,520
like soft really soft but when I powder

1526
01:01:31,559 --> 01:01:37,960
it up in the kitchen sink or in the

1527
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:40,599
bathroom sink and I take a sponge or I

1528
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:42,680
take a cloth and I it just gets rid of

1529
01:01:40,599 --> 01:01:44,599
every stain and you could just you could

1530
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:47,760
just scrub and wipe and you could get

1531
01:01:44,599 --> 01:01:50,000
rid of every stain even like water

1532
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:52,079
stains that have copper in the pipes and

1533
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:53,760
everything else you know all that all of

1534
01:01:52,079 --> 01:01:56,680
a sudden you're you got a sparkling

1535
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:58,559
clean sink in stainless steel sink too

1536
01:01:56,680 --> 01:02:00,839
in the kitchen you can get it like

1537
01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:06,559
spotless clean

1538
01:02:00,839 --> 01:02:09,760
looking and yeah why they're really soft

1539
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:11,839
and smooth and silky stuff because it's

1540
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:14,920
it it acts of sandpaper once you apply

1541
01:02:11,839 --> 01:02:17,920
pressure so when you have Clay and even

1542
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:21,400
dious Earth particles and it's on the

1543
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:24,079
lining of the intestinal tract and

1544
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:28,880
colon what happens is food will go

1545
01:02:24,079 --> 01:02:32,520
against it and rub it'll put pressure if

1546
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:34,279
you eat a bigger meal more pressure more

1547
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:36,200
pressure I'm not saying don't eat big

1548
01:02:34,279 --> 01:02:39,319
meals I mean whatever you eat meals that

1549
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:43,599
you feel comfortable with more

1550
01:02:39,319 --> 01:02:47,200
pressure and it rubs rubs along the

1551
01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:51,520
sides of the colon in the intestinal

1552
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:54,720
tract and it doesn't clean it it doesn't

1553
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:56,480
clean it it's not what it's doing not

1554
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:58,680
what the clay is

1555
01:02:56,480 --> 01:03:00,520
doing somebody's probably out there

1556
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:02,079
saying yeah what about animals though

1557
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:04,240
they eat clay and they stay healthy they

1558
01:03:02,079 --> 01:03:07,039
do that they're known to eat some clay

1559
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:09,839
your intestinal track isn't built like a

1560
01:03:07,039 --> 01:03:13,240
deer's intestinal track I can tell you

1561
01:03:09,839 --> 01:03:18,799
that it's not built like a deer's int a

1562
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:22,319
deer can Munch up the most impossible

1563
01:03:18,799 --> 01:03:25,960
things and the most toxic things in

1564
01:03:22,319 --> 01:03:28,279
swallow sticks and Twigs with toxic

1565
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:31,319
alkaloids I mean I'm talking about real

1566
01:03:28,279 --> 01:03:32,880
toxic alkaloids make you sick I mean put

1567
01:03:31,319 --> 01:03:37,160
you in a hospital you ate all those

1568
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:39,880
Twigs if you even if you even uh Juiced

1569
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:42,200
those twigs and Juice those alkaloids

1570
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:44,279
out of you know different Twigs from all

1571
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:46,160
kinds of different levels of of of I

1572
01:03:44,279 --> 01:03:49,520
mean all different species of bushes

1573
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:52,000
shrubs and and trees man you even drank

1574
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:55,000
a an ounce of that juice you'd be in the

1575
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:57,480
hospital the tannins in there which just

1576
01:03:55,000 --> 01:04:00,559
to just annihilate you meaning it

1577
01:03:57,480 --> 01:04:02,359
wouldn't kill you You' be so

1578
01:04:00,559 --> 01:04:06,039
sick

1579
01:04:02,359 --> 01:04:08,880
um even Maple Ser I mean even Maple

1580
01:04:06,039 --> 01:04:11,200
Water Maple Water that they boil away to

1581
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:13,599
make maple syrup Maple

1582
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:15,119
Water has so much Tan in it that if you

1583
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:18,559
drink too much Maple Water you'll just

1584
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:20,359
be like drooling you'll drool I I

1585
01:04:18,559 --> 01:04:22,760
remember I was actually I even did that

1586
01:04:20,359 --> 01:04:24,279
one time I I love Maple Water you can

1587
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:26,000
only have a little bit of it this stuff

1588
01:04:24,279 --> 01:04:27,720
is medicinal Maple Water is different

1589
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:29,960
than you know like maple syrup when they

1590
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:32,319
boil it down to the sugars Maple Water

1591
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:34,599
has a lot of tannning in it a lot of

1592
01:04:32,319 --> 01:04:36,559
tannin it's hidden in there they drink

1593
01:04:34,599 --> 01:04:40,200
it it's like wow that was the freshest

1594
01:04:36,559 --> 01:04:42,680
cleanest water I've ever consumed it was

1595
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:44,599
like a miracle and it is when you drink

1596
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:47,440
a little bit of Maple Water it's like a

1597
01:04:44,599 --> 01:04:50,680
miracle but let me have more Spirit like

1598
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:52,400
try not to overdo it don't overdo it I'm

1599
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:54,839
like no I'm I'm I'm with a friend we're

1600
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:57,200
in the woods it's his maple it's his

1601
01:04:54,839 --> 01:05:00,319
Maple set up he's got it all set up he's

1602
01:04:57,200 --> 01:05:03,640
got the containers up against the

1603
01:05:00,319 --> 01:05:05,200
trees and you know we're Upstate and

1604
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:06,839

we're so this is great and I'm like I'm

1607
01:05:10,279 --> 01:05:14,920
guzzling the stuff I'm like this is

1608
01:05:12,839 --> 01:05:17,079
incredible this reminds me of coconut

1609
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:18,839
water when I'm drinking fresh coconut

1610
01:05:17,079 --> 01:05:20,599
water out of the coconut and and you

1611
01:05:18,839 --> 01:05:23,160
know and I'm drinking them and you I'm

1612
01:05:20,599 --> 01:05:24,960
drinking it and all of a sudden I'm like

1613
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:27,119
oh crap

1614
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:30,000
I didn't say crap I said the bad

1615
01:05:27,119 --> 01:05:33,000
word at when it happened I think I said

1616
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:36,599
a couple of bad words I think I said I

1617
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:39,359
said the other bad word too oh

1618
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:42,760
bleep and you know and it was like I

1619
01:05:39,359 --> 01:05:44,079
feel those tannins uhoh overdid it and

1620
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:45,119
spirit was like told you but when are

1621
01:05:44,079 --> 01:05:47,000
you going to learn you don't listen to

1622
01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:50,799
me sometimes I said yeah I know I'm

1623
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:52,839
stubborn and you know and so it was the

1624
01:05:50,799 --> 01:05:56,599
tannins and that was just and that was

1625
01:05:52,839 --> 01:05:59,799
Maple Water and I was drooling I had the

1626
01:05:56,599 --> 01:06:02,680
drools for like three days until this

1627
01:05:59,799 --> 01:06:06,960
day when I think of maple water drinking

1628
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:10,039
Maple Water my stomach turns and I feel

1629
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:13,200
nauseous tannin can actually give you a

1630
01:06:10,039 --> 01:06:15,160
memory that connects to the nerves that

1631
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:17,559
were affected by the

1632
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:19,720
tannin so I like Maple Water I just

1633
01:06:17,559 --> 01:06:22,559
can't drink it and if someone does drink

1634
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:24,400
it just drink a little and then have

1635
01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:25,960
another you know week later drink a

1636
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:27,799
little or a couple days later drink a

1637
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:29,400
little I believe in Maple Water so I'm

1638
01:06:27,799 --> 01:06:32,039
not anti- Maple Water I believe in it I

1639
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:34,319
want I want people to try it just don't

1640
01:06:32,039 --> 01:06:37,640
drink a ton of that stuff don't drink a

1641
01:06:34,319 --> 01:06:40,599
case of that stuff or like I did a

1642
01:06:37,640 --> 01:06:42,640
gallon of that stuff at once too much

1643
01:06:40,599 --> 01:06:44,520
tannin at once I have a memory to it why

1644
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:47,839
am I talking about the

1645
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:50,400
tannins I'm talking about the tannins

1646
01:06:47,839 --> 01:06:55,319
because a

1647
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:58,920
deer or any other animals a deer has a

1648
01:06:55,319 --> 01:07:00,760
different intestinal tract than us okay

1649
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:03,799
it can eat things you couldn't believe

1650
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:05,480
it can eat it can eat clay yeah it can

1651
01:07:03,799 --> 01:07:07,680
eat clay it can eat dirt it can eat clay

1652
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:09,520
no problem it can eat clay it can eat

1653
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:11,480
different varieties of Clays and

1654
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:13,960
different at different

1655
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:18,039
places on the

1656
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:19,599
planet but it can do that for a reason

1657
01:07:18,039 --> 01:07:23,079
the intestinal tra is built entirely

1658
01:07:19,599 --> 01:07:24,880
different than ours in many ways and we

1659
01:07:23,079 --> 01:07:26,839
can't handle that CL and like I said the

1660
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:28,680
bonami and the sink we can't we can't

1661
01:07:26,839 --> 01:07:31,680
handle that

1662
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:33,920
clay so just giving you that as another

1663
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:37,480
another another tidbit here that's what

1664
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:39,119
I wanted to not forget I feel like that

1665
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:40,319
after we explored so much with the gut

1666
01:07:39,119 --> 01:07:43,279
and everything else in the gut health

1667
01:07:40,319 --> 01:07:45,359
that I was going to forget that um any

1668
01:07:43,279 --> 01:07:47,960
any herble tea going on anybody got

1669
01:07:45,359 --> 01:07:49,520
something can I drink something now it's

1670
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:51,680
we're already past an hour we still got

1671
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:52,920
a ways to go and I'm going to have a sip

1672
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:55,240
just bear with

1673
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:58,799
me

1674
01:07:55,240 --> 01:08:01,680
so I could just keep my throat

1675
01:07:58,799 --> 01:08:04,160
moist so the liver's role is to create

1676
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:06,440
ble to break down fats to thin them out

1677
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:09,319
in the bloodstream so our heart doesn't

1678
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:10,640
weaken so our heart isn't bombarded by

1679
01:08:09,319 --> 01:08:12,319
high

1680
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:15,960
fat

1681
01:08:12,319 --> 01:08:17,960
but what we do is we end up getting in

1682
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:20,199
trouble and we get our liver broken down

1683
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:21,679
and it gets stagnant gets sluggish and

1684
01:08:20,199 --> 01:08:24,839
it gets problematic and we can't even

1685
01:08:21,679 --> 01:08:27,000
protect our heart diabetes diabetes is

1686
01:08:24,839 --> 01:08:30,159
going to get thrown into the thyroid

1687
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:31,520
trap as well you know I guarantee you

1688
01:08:30,159 --> 01:08:34,159
that's going to head into the thyroid

1689
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:35,239
trap diabetes it's going to be one of

1690
01:08:34,159 --> 01:08:38,759
these things

1691
01:08:35,239 --> 01:08:40,560
where where um it's going to be like

1692
01:08:38,759 --> 01:08:42,640
well you know what diabetics people with

1693
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:45,080
type two diabetes develop develop a

1694
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:46,839
thyroid problem so obviously it's the

1695
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:49,960
thyroid that's it's all part of the

1696
01:08:46,839 --> 01:08:52,799
thyroid no it's it's not the diabetes

1697
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:56,040
type two diabetes type two is a liver

1698
01:08:52,799 --> 01:08:57,640
condition that's a liver condition

1699
01:08:56,040 --> 01:09:00,040
that's a liver becoming

1700
01:08:57,640 --> 01:09:02,120
dysfunctional and losing its storage

1701
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:04,600
losing its glucose losing its glyc and

1702
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:06,799
storage not being able to break down

1703
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:08,239
fats and then the fats building up

1704
01:09:06,799 --> 01:09:10,040
building up in the heart building up in

1705
01:09:08,239 --> 01:09:12,960
other places building up in the

1706
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:14,319
bloodstream so it it's really kind of a

1707
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:17,199
separate

1708
01:09:14,319 --> 01:09:19,920
issue what is

1709
01:09:17,199 --> 01:09:21,359
connected what is connected in general

1710
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:25,279
with the thyroid and everything else the

1711
01:09:21,359 --> 01:09:27,359
thyroid is a is a symptom become

1712
01:09:25,279 --> 01:09:31,159
symptomatic mean part one of the things

1713
01:09:27,359 --> 01:09:32,799
that gets affected by not by anything

1714
01:09:31,159 --> 01:09:34,199
but something else what happens is when

1715
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:36,239
we get all these different symptoms that

1716
01:09:34,199 --> 01:09:37,719
are liver related a lot of them we get

1717
01:09:36,239 --> 01:09:39,640
all these different symptoms that are

1718
01:09:37,719 --> 01:09:42,440
being thrown into the thyroid bag

1719
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:44,640
tingles and numbness confusion brain fog

1720
01:09:42,440 --> 01:09:46,279
aches and pains all these different

1721
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:49,199
things that are keep that keep on

1722
01:09:46,279 --> 01:09:52,000
getting thrown into the thyroid trap um

1723
01:09:49,199 --> 01:09:54,960
you know symptoms hot flashes uh thrown

1724
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:56,679
into the thyroid trap um you know the

1725
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:58,400
the list goes on I'm I'm forgetting

1726
01:09:56,679 --> 01:09:59,560
about a lot of symptoms I'm sure you

1727
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:01,120
probably are thinking how come he's not

1728
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:05,960
saying this symptom well it's probably

1729
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:07,159
that symptom too um and uh so when it

1730
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:09,239
gets thrown in there there is an

1731
01:10:07,159 --> 01:10:11,280
affiliation affiliation is most these

1732
01:10:09,239 --> 01:10:13,040
symptoms are created by a viral

1733
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:15,360
condition by the Epstein bar an

1734
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:17,360
underlying cause it just so happens the

1735
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:19,400
Epstein bar if you've read book one the

1736
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:21,040
Epstein bar gets into the thyroid

1737
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:22,440
causing a thyroid problem too which is

1738
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:25,120
one of these things but it's not the

1739
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:29,920
reduction of the thyroid horm hormones

1740
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:32,360
or the thyroid becoming problematic or

1741
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:33,800
nodules on the thyroid that are causing

1742
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:35,880
all these other symptoms that are

1743
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:37,600
causing these problems and that's the

1744
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:40,560
that's what we have to get across it's

1745
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:43,199
important the thyroid you can get a

1746
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:45,280
temperature fluctuation if a thyroid is

1747
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:47,600
problematic that's a symptom from the

1748
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:49,760
thyroid that is one of the symptoms from

1749
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:52,000
the thyroid the thyroid has very few

1750
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:53,920
symptoms when you have this is an

1751
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:56,199
example I have people that don't have

1752
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:57,440
thyroids or have th their thyroids have

1753
01:10:56,199 --> 01:11:00,960
been killed

1754
01:10:57,440 --> 01:11:03,760
off and they still kept all of their

1755
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:05,719
other symptoms all of their other

1756
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:08,000
symptoms there's people that just have

1757
01:11:05,719 --> 01:11:10,320
had hyper hypothyroid sorry

1758
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:12,199
hypothyroidism Hashimoto they've gotten

1759
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:14,400
their numbers better their Hashimoto

1760
01:11:12,199 --> 01:11:16,880
even backed down you know and and their

1761
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:18,199
numbers got better they had hypothyroid

1762
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:20,440
and their numbers got better and their

1763
01:11:18,199 --> 01:11:22,920
thyroid got better but yet all their

1764
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:24,440
symptoms stayed all their symptoms

1765
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:27,000
whatever they were tingles numbness

1766
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:29,679
vertigo aches and pains your brain fog

1767
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:32,400
confusion you name it I mean the list

1768
01:11:29,679 --> 01:11:34,400
goes on oh the weight gain if yeah

1769
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:36,239
weight gain all of it but for some

1770
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:37,719
reason if thyroid was back to normal the

1771
01:11:36,239 --> 01:11:41,320
doctors

1772
01:11:37,719 --> 01:11:43,400
felt because it wasn't the thyroid that

1773
01:11:41,320 --> 01:11:46,840
created those symptoms to begin

1774
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:48,440
with so why am I even going here now in

1775
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:50,520
this webinar because when it comes down

1776
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:52,560
to the gut when it comes down to our gut

1777
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:55,960
health and secrets of the gut health and

1778
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:58,480
everything it's not the thyroid causing

1779
01:11:55,960 --> 01:12:00,719
the gut health problems and that's where

1780
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:03,320
it's going next that's where we're

1781
01:12:00,719 --> 01:12:06,320
heading now into trendy misinformation

1782
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:07,920
thyroid world as the books keep on

1783
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:09,960
getting stamped out with

1784
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:12,040
misinformation you know listen I

1785
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:14,600
wouldn't have any right to say that at

1786
01:12:12,040 --> 01:12:16,960
all if if I wasn't giving the given the

1787
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:19,520

1790
01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:26,560
I was like Hey a gift this is gift for

and it's for you guys so that's why it's

1796
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:42,360
important to know so you're going to

1797
01:12:39,080 --> 01:12:43,600
find that if you had a sibo diagnosis

1798
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:46,000
you're eventually going to get thrown

1799
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:48,239
into the thyroid thing with it you know

1800
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:50,120
along the way I mean seriously and you'd

1801
01:12:48,239 --> 01:12:52,159
think well why would that be small in

1802
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:55,040
small intestinal track you know you know

1803
01:12:52,159 --> 01:12:57,719
bacterial overgrowth

1804
01:12:55,040 --> 01:13:00,360
why would that get thrown into um into

1805
01:12:57,719 --> 01:13:02,280
thyroid it just it's it's going to it's

1806
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:04,320
going to you know that's going to be

1807
01:13:02,280 --> 01:13:06,239
kind of thrown in Lecky gut's going to

1808
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:08,120
get thrown into thyroid everything

1809
01:13:06,239 --> 01:13:11,560
everything gut related is going to get

1810
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:13,239
thrown bloating cramps in the gut you

1811
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:14,880
know anything going on in the gut is

1812
01:13:13,239 --> 01:13:16,719
going to get thrown into the thyroid and

1813
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:18,679
that's that's where it's going so I

1814
01:13:16,719 --> 01:13:22,280
wanted to do a gut health show because

1815
01:13:18,679 --> 01:13:24,480
of this very reason um even Celiac is

1816
01:13:22,280 --> 01:13:25,800
going to get thrown in there

1817
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:31,120
over

1818
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:34,080
time so what can we do what can we do I

1819
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:35,719
mean I can keep on going about the

1820
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:37,120
Mysteries and the secrets and the truth

1821
01:13:35,719 --> 01:13:39,280
about our gut health and everything

1822
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:41,719
which I hope you guys find

1823
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:43,520
interesting but what can we do for it

1824
01:13:41,719 --> 01:13:45,080
and stuff you know the celery juice

1825
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:46,960
thing many of you know maybe some of you

1826
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:48,880
were new to this whole thing celery

1827
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:50,639
juice is undiscovered mineral salt

1828
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:53,480
subgroups that they can't find they just

1829
01:13:50,639 --> 01:13:56,320
sodium is not all sodium and research

1830
01:13:53,480 --> 01:13:59,000
science hasn't put you know hasn't put

1831
01:13:56,320 --> 01:14:03,000
50 million 100 million $200 million into

1832
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:04,679
into analyzing celery or celery juice um

1833
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:06,080
it hasn't done that it'll just keep on

1834
01:14:04,679 --> 01:14:08,199
putting those hundreds of millions into

1835
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:10,360
jeans because jeans are great because

1836
01:14:08,199 --> 01:14:12,360
they're so interesting as heck everybody

1837
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:14,560
believes in them and it's incredible to

1838
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:16,320
use as a blame game for everybody it's

1839
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:18,040
your fault your jeans are bad that's why

1840
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:20,040
you got thyroid problems it's your jeans

1841
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:21,760
it's always jeans jeans jeans jeans just

1842
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:23,480
never fall for that it's one of the

1843
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:26,120
great mistakes that wrote and thyroid he

1844
01:14:23,480 --> 01:14:27,320
you can read about that one and then I

1845
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:28,760
think you're going to really like that

1846
01:14:27,320 --> 01:14:30,239
when you read that one you'll be like

1847
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:31,600
okay now it makes sense more than I

1848
01:14:30,239 --> 01:14:35,679
could just tell you right now in our

1849
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:38,480
time frame but but they're not going to

1850
01:14:35,679 --> 01:14:40,199
put $100 million into celery it's not

1851
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:42,760
going to happen or a billion dollars

1852
01:14:40,199 --> 01:14:45,320
into celery and celery has all these

1853
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:47,639
different subgroups of salts entirely

1854
01:14:45,320 --> 01:14:49,800
different undiscovered entirely

1855
01:14:47,639 --> 01:14:51,320
different those are the subgroups that

1856
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:53,840
actually rebuild the seven blend to

1857
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:55,199
rebuild your hydrochloric acid so yeah

1858
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:58,719
do I sound like a broken record do your

1859
01:14:55,199 --> 01:15:00,520
celery juice I probably do but also I

1860
01:14:58,719 --> 01:15:02,719
find that people forget to do it anyway

1861
01:15:00,520 --> 01:15:07,520
so it's good I keep on telling tell

1862
01:15:02,719 --> 01:15:11,000
saying it you know

1863
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:12,960
so okay so um do 4 ounces of celery

1864
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:14,960
juice get the big stalks throw it

1865
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:16,560
through a juicer go to a juice place

1866
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:18,520
just get straight celery if you can't

1867
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:19,840
stand it put a little apple in it if you

1868
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:21,679
can't stand straight celery put a

1869
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:23,800
cucumber in it I I'll deal with that I

1870
01:15:21,679 --> 01:15:25,400
could live with that but the more juice

1871
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:27,760
the better your hydrochloric acid builds

1872
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:30,000
up and you find a lot of your symptoms

1873
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:32,480
can go away because once your

1874
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:35,239
hydrochloric acid is build up your liver

1875
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:37,080
gets a little stronger your liver which

1876
01:15:35,239 --> 01:15:39,880
is behind so many different gut health

1877
01:15:37,080 --> 01:15:42,800
symptoms and other symptoms once your

1878
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:47,000
hydrochloric acid gets built up

1879
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:49,080
stronger then protein doesn't rot and

1880
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:51,639
that means whether you're a vegetarian

1881
01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:54,080
and you're eating soy protein I don't

1882
01:15:51,639 --> 01:15:55,560
really like soy protein let but I

1883
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:58,480
understand if that's all you got is some

1884
01:15:55,560 --> 01:16:00,400
tofu I totally get it but or you're a

1885
01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:02,880
vean that's eating tons and tons of nuts

1886
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:06,080
to try to get protein and nut Butters or

1887
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:09,040
you're an you know a a whatever an

1888
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:11,719
animal protein lover that you know loves

1889
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:12,840
the high protein animal diet and no carb

1890
01:16:11,719 --> 01:16:15,239
diet and that's what you love or

1891
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:18,000
something and you're doing lots of meat

1892
01:16:15,239 --> 01:16:21,480
and chicken and pork or whatever lamb or

1893
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:23,440
whatever you're doing and eggs you know

1894
01:16:21,480 --> 01:16:25,639
the point is is you want that stuff to

1895
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:28,600
break down better so it doesn't rot and

1896
01:16:25,639 --> 01:16:32,760
purify as it goes through the gut don't

1897
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:36,360
do eggs eggs feed every bug in the

1898
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:39,560
body and uh they just do I I I can't say

1899
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:40,880
it enough eggs create so many gut health

1900
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:44,320
problems I want to talk about this part

1901
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:46,600
about gut health too by the way um with

1902
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:48,120
regarding to to how gut the gut health

1903
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:50,080
works with so many people with different

1904
01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:52,440
symptoms many people feel like they

1905
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:54,280
can't digest anything and you you might

1906
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:58,239
be one of them right you might be one of

1907
01:16:54,280 --> 01:16:59,920
them and um and you'll feel like you

1908
01:16:58,239 --> 01:17:02,520
can't digest but there's some things you

1909
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:05,719
feel you can eat that you digest fine

1910
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:07,960
it's not that you're digesting it fine

1911
01:17:05,719 --> 01:17:10,320
it's just that you don't feel it touch

1912
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:12,639
nerves the nerves in the intestinal

1913
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:14,040
tract sometimes get so IR irritable and

1914
01:17:12,639 --> 01:17:17,360
irritated especially if you have a lot

1915
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:19,679
of neurotoxins if Epstein bar is inside

1916
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:23,239
the liver or in the body or even inside

1917
01:17:19,679 --> 01:17:24,960
the thyroid which by the way um I

1918
01:17:23,239 --> 01:17:27,639
brought to the table for the first time

1919
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:29,280
in history sepin bar sits inside is is

1920
01:17:27,639 --> 01:17:31,040
is the thyroid problem you're going to

1921
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:33,199
read about it more in thyroid healing

1922
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:37,560
than I even did in book one medical

1923
01:17:33,199 --> 01:17:39,159
medium um of course and and what happens

1924
01:17:37,560 --> 01:17:41,679
is if you got the Epstein bar in the

1925
01:17:39,159 --> 01:17:44,719
liver and it's feeding off of pollutants

1926
01:17:41,679 --> 01:17:47,920
solvents garbage poisons

1927
01:17:44,719 --> 01:17:51,120
toxins it's then releasing those poisons

1928
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:53,679
and toxins into into your body okay into

1929
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:56,199
your bloodstream into your blood stream

1930
01:17:53,679 --> 01:18:00,040
they get into the intestinal tract they

1931
01:17:56,199 --> 01:18:01,920
get into the bladder they cause nerve

1932
01:18:00,040 --> 01:18:04,199
sensitivities which can give you a sense

1933
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:07,520
of citis too in your in your

1934
01:18:04,199 --> 01:18:10,000
bladder um they can these toxins build

1935
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:11,960
up they get in the intestinal Linings

1936
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:14,639
and they hit all the little nerves and

1937
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:17,400
they make them sensitive you eat

1938
01:18:14,639 --> 01:18:19,560
something like you chew a celery stick

1939
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:21,320
you feel like you won't digest it you

1940
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:23,679
chew a cucumber you feel like you're not

1941
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:25,440
going to digest anything you eat

1942
01:18:23,679 --> 01:18:27,400
something like some lettuce you're going

1943
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:29,280
to feel like it hurts it doesn't digest

1944
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:31,239
anything cuz what it's doing is it's

1945
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:32,840
touching the Linings as it's going

1946
01:18:31,239 --> 01:18:35,400
through the intestinal tract and it's

1947
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:38,760
hitting every single hot nerve along the

1948
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:40,600
way including fruits that have berries

1949
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:43,600
and berries that have seeds and so forth

1950
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:47,360
it just it hits line hits the

1951
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:49,960
lining and you may feel though that when

1952
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:52,040
you eat an egg you feel like you

1953
01:18:49,960 --> 01:18:54,159
digested it perfectly and I understand

1954
01:18:52,040 --> 01:18:56,600
that if it feels good then I get it but

1955
01:18:54,159 --> 01:18:58,760
the reason why eggs don't touch the

1956
01:18:56,600 --> 01:19:02,159
Linings of the intestinal tract and the

1957
01:18:58,760 --> 01:19:03,840
colon they don't touch the Linings they

1958
01:19:02,159 --> 01:19:06,239
actually sit in the middle as like a

1959
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:09,239
glue that just goes through it doesn't

1960
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:11,239
trigger off nerves cuz it's not touching

1961
01:19:09,239 --> 01:19:14,120
anything that's why so many people are

1962
01:19:11,239 --> 01:19:16,159
like I can eat an egg but if I eat an

1963
01:19:14,120 --> 01:19:18,719
egg on some lettuce it's the lettuce I

1964
01:19:16,159 --> 01:19:21,600
can't digest the lettuce you're you can

1965
01:19:18,719 --> 01:19:23,960
digest the lettuce it's just that it

1966
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:25,880
hurts if you have those one of the if

1967
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:29,360
you're one of those people with a really

1968
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:31,880
really really hyp sensitive gut issue

1969
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:34,440
hyper sensitive intestinal track issue

1970
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:36,920
it's going to

1971
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:39,120
hurt they have to think you have to you

1972
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:42,400
have to know that that that's why it's

1973
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:44,520
doing it now avocado I noticed though I

1974
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:47,560
can get avocado in people sometimes some

1975
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:49,960
banana if it's ripe in the right way not

1976
01:19:47,560 --> 01:19:52,400
fully rip not too ripe overripe and not

1977
01:19:49,960 --> 01:19:55,440
under rpe and you know things like

1978
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:56,840
winter squash can be a lot smoother for

1979
01:19:55,440 --> 01:19:58,360
people that are in that condition

1980
01:19:56,840 --> 01:20:00,920
they're really sensitive sometimes

1981
01:19:58,360 --> 01:20:02,320
potatoes can and avocados can there's

1982
01:20:00,920 --> 01:20:03,719
you know there's different foods

1983
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:05,719
steaming vegetables till they're

1984
01:20:03,719 --> 01:20:07,600
literally they fall through a fork the

1985
01:20:05,719 --> 01:20:10,320
fork falls through it can also you know

1986
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:12,000
kind of help but I get it and if you eat

1987
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:13,239
too many things raw and crunchy and all

1988
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:15,520
that it's going to touch it all but it

1989
01:20:13,239 --> 01:20:17,840
doesn't mean you're not digesting it

1990
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:20,400
doesn't mean you're not digesting it but

1991
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:21,920
when you drink the celery juice and the

1992
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:24,560
cucumber juice you could do cucumber

1993
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:26,760
juice too you it's like soothing it

1994
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:28,199
starts to heal those Linings and heal

1995
01:20:26,760 --> 01:20:29,880
heal those nerves by getting rid of

1996
01:20:28,199 --> 01:20:31,880
those Epstein bar poisons out of the

1997
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:33,239
liver and out of the intestinal lining

1998
01:20:31,880 --> 01:20:35,120
which eventually will make you less

1999
01:20:33,239 --> 01:20:37,920
sensitive on the

2000
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:40,280
nerves so that's important what not to

2001
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:44,679
eat don't eat dairy don't eat milk

2002
01:20:40,280 --> 01:20:46,320

01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:05,639

01:21:05,639 --> 01:21:12,360
didn't and not only that it might have

2014
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:14,760
that part down but you don't want to be

2015
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:16,800
on high high protein which is high fat

2016
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:19,120

01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:29,520
you may eat something and not realize

2159
01:26:27,560 --> 01:26:31,320
it's a causing a problem three days

2160
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:34,280
later there's a delayed effect and then

2161
01:26:31,320 --> 01:26:36,520
whatever you ate that moment you thought

2162
01:26:34,280 --> 01:26:38,880
was the problem like for instance you

2163
01:26:36,520 --> 01:26:41,600
can eat a piece of fruit but if you

2164
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:43,199
actually have something in you that's

2165
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:45,520
moving through you and it finally gets

2166
01:26:43,199 --> 01:26:47,920
to that sensitive spot down there by the

2167
01:26:45,520 --> 01:26:50,040
ilocal valve and it gets to that second

2168
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:51,800
sensitive spot down there and then it

2169
01:26:50,040 --> 01:26:53,360
hits that inflamed spot right when

2170
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:55,520
you're eating an apple and the Apple

2171
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:57,000
never even got down past the dadum yet

2172
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:59,600
it never even got down out of your

2173
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:01,600
stomach yet but yet the timing was right

2174
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:04,600
where peristaltic action because you

2175
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:06,880
were just eating per peristaltic action

2176
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:09,360
just squeezed finally some food that you

2177
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:11,400
had two days ago right down to your yo

2178
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:13,440
sequel you're going to blame the

2179
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:17,280
Apple that's another confusion that

2180
01:27:13,440 --> 01:27:19,280
happens all the time all the time so

2181
01:27:17,280 --> 01:27:20,920
then but you'll still eat that bad food

2182
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:22,480
that you ate 3 days ago because you

2183
01:27:20,920 --> 01:27:24,360
don't think it caused a problem because

2184
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:27,040
it it didn't get to that part in your

2185
01:27:24,360 --> 01:27:30,360
intestinal tract to cause that

2186
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:31,920
problem yet that's another thing to be

2187
01:27:30,360 --> 01:27:34,280
concerned

2188
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:35,679
about probiotics that's a big thing

2189
01:27:34,280 --> 01:27:37,719
everybody worries about and everything I

2190
01:27:35,679 --> 01:27:39,600
would try to grow something one time a

2191
01:27:37,719 --> 01:27:41,920
year any time a year whatever you can do

2192
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:43,600
grow anything grow it in a pot inside

2193
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:45,560
grow Sprouts because you get those

2194
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:48,800
elevated biotics that nobody knows about

2195
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:50,679
it's still a secret I put it in book one

2196
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:52,400
I talked about it before in radio shows

2197
01:27:50,679 --> 01:27:55,520
and nobody still knows about it out

2198
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:58,320
there it breaks my heart elevated

2199
01:27:55,520 --> 01:28:01,719
biotics is not a microorganism that's in

2200
01:27:58,320 --> 01:28:04,840
dirt okay those are weak they need to

2201
01:28:01,719 --> 01:28:07,119
hide in dirt elevated biotics sit on the

2202
01:28:04,840 --> 01:28:09,119
leaf they sit on the leaf like in the

2203
01:28:07,119 --> 01:28:10,480
garden they sit on the Tomato in the

2204
01:28:09,119 --> 01:28:12,360
garden they sit on things in the garden

2205
01:28:10,480 --> 01:28:14,480
they sit on an apple on the Apple Tree

2206
01:28:12,360 --> 01:28:16,159
they sit go to the Farm's market and

2207
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:17,719
just get you know some organic apples

2208
01:28:16,159 --> 01:28:19,840
and I guarantee you they'll have the

2209
01:28:17,719 --> 01:28:22,880
elevated probiotics I mean not probiotic

2210
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:24,639
the elevated biotic right on top of it

2211
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:27,239
and you get that elevated biotic and

2212
01:28:24,639 --> 01:28:28,880
that produces B12 inside your intestinal

2213
01:28:27,239 --> 01:28:30,760
tract that's the elevated biotic that

2214
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:33,520
saves your life you even have some of it

2215
01:28:30,760 --> 01:28:36,880
in you in your in your

2216
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:38,199
elium you even have some in your alium

2217
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:40,360
that you might have gotten from a

2218
01:28:38,199 --> 01:28:43,520
raspberry you picked walking on a trail

2219
01:28:40,360 --> 01:28:44,520
20 years ago way better than probiotics

2220
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:46,040
can ever

2221
01:28:44,520 --> 01:28:48,199
be

2222
01:28:46,040 --> 01:28:50,400
so that's something you want to do in

2223
01:28:48,199 --> 01:28:52,719
your life you want to try to get out

2224
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:54,239
pick a few berries go to an organic farm

2225
01:28:52,719 --> 01:28:56,119
that lets you go out there and you're

2226
01:28:54,239 --> 01:28:57,719
picking your pint of strawberries right

2227
01:28:56,119 --> 01:29:00,320
there and you eat one strawberry or

2228
01:28:57,719 --> 01:29:02,480
whatever it is do it next year if you

2229
01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:05,280
missed it this year maybe blueberry

2230
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:07,320
season's out right now and you can go to

2231
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:10,520
a a farm somewhere but you know it's

2232
01:29:07,320 --> 01:29:11,920
it's whatever you you can do like that

2233
01:29:10,520 --> 01:29:14,280
grow something in your garden grow

2234
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:16,199
Sprouts inside the house grow some

2235
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:19,360
different Sprouts fenig Greek sprouts

2236
01:29:16,199 --> 01:29:21,159
red clover Sprouts um you know grow you

2237
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:24,800
know a little bit broccoli Sprouts kale

2238
01:29:21,159 --> 01:29:27,040
sprouts kale routs are amazing um pees

2239
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:30,199
they'll have the the

2240
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:33,119
bacteria these microorganisms that are

2241
01:29:30,199 --> 01:29:34,600
unstoppable they bypass the stomach

2242
01:29:33,119 --> 01:29:36,280
hydrochloric acid even no matter what

2243
01:29:34,600 --> 01:29:38,719
kind of hydrochloric acid you got built

2244
01:29:36,280 --> 01:29:41,360
all seven blend up the par it can't kill

2245
01:29:38,719 --> 01:29:43,320
these microorganisms and they go down

2246
01:29:41,360 --> 01:29:45,960
deep into the gut and they get our

2247
01:29:43,320 --> 01:29:48,239
health back in our gut kale Farmers

2248
01:29:45,960 --> 01:29:51,000
Market kale will have so much of this

2249
01:29:48,239 --> 01:29:53,320
this this microorganism on the leaf if

2250
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:56,199
you eat one piece of this kale you can

2251
01:29:53,320 --> 01:29:58,520
help restore your gut to get it back to

2252
01:29:56,199 --> 01:30:02,480
where you need to start start stomping

2253
01:29:58,520 --> 01:30:04,520
on um stacus stomping on eoli stomping

2254
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:06,159
on viruses inside the gut I mean

2255
01:30:04,520 --> 01:30:09,880
honestly that is one of the most

2256
01:30:06,159 --> 01:30:11,800
powerful secrets of all time that Spirit

2257
01:30:09,880 --> 01:30:17,320
blessed me

2258
01:30:11,800 --> 01:30:19,280
with so I can tell you and it's that

2259
01:30:17,320 --> 01:30:21,880
elevated biotic that's a

2260
01:30:19,280 --> 01:30:24,400
lifesaver and it saturates the intested

2261
01:30:21,880 --> 01:30:25,800
inal Linings and it sits in the Elum

2262
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:29,119
where where it loves to stay cuz that's

2263
01:30:25,800 --> 01:30:30,639
where it loves to go and camp out mostly

2264
01:30:29,119 --> 01:30:32,639
but it goes all through the intestinal

2265
01:30:30,639 --> 01:30:34,400
tract sits in the helium and it creates

2266
01:30:32,639 --> 01:30:36,920
B12 the kind of B12 that stops

2267
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:38,800
methylation problems methylation

2268
01:30:36,920 --> 01:30:40,320
problems are caused by Epstein bar

2269
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:41,719
they're caused by Epstein bar creating

2270
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:44,880
tons of toxins setting off the

2271
01:30:41,719 --> 01:30:47,360
methylation G mutation test how do I

2272
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:49,000
know Spirit told me how do I have proof

2273
01:30:47,360 --> 01:30:51,400
because I can get people to reverse that

2274
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:53,239
Gene by getting rid of their Epstein bar

2275
01:30:51,400 --> 01:30:54,719
and getting their toxins down so when

2276
01:30:53,239 --> 01:30:56,800
they get the test the doctor's like oh

2277
01:30:54,719 --> 01:30:58,360
wait a minute you you don't have a gene

2278
01:30:56,800 --> 01:31:01,239
mutation what happened what happened

2279
01:30:58,360 --> 01:31:04,840
what you never did to begin with you

2280
01:31:01,239 --> 01:31:06,119
never did to begin with so methylation

2281
01:31:04,840 --> 01:31:08,199
has a lot to do with these elevated

2282
01:31:06,119 --> 01:31:09,480
biotics on those kinds of foods so

2283
01:31:08,199 --> 01:31:11,960
that's another secret to getting

2284
01:31:09,480 --> 01:31:13,920
yourself better I've seen people do it

2285
01:31:11,960 --> 01:31:16,360
over and over again all since I was a

2286
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:19,320
child all the way to

2287
01:31:16,360 --> 01:31:22,320
now back years and years and years ago

2288
01:31:19,320 --> 01:31:23,800
you walk into a pharmacy

2289
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:26,639
and you say you got a probiotic they

2290
01:31:23,800 --> 01:31:28,560
wouldn't even know what one

2291
01:31:26,639 --> 01:31:32,159
was

2292
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:34,119
and even even funnier than that tell

2293
01:31:32,159 --> 01:31:38,280
them about elevated biotics on top of a

2294
01:31:34,119 --> 01:31:41,560
Leafa kale that look like you're

2295
01:31:38,280 --> 01:31:43,880
insane you know the thing is is uh I

2296
01:31:41,560 --> 01:31:47,159
mean you go all the way back look for go

2297
01:31:43,880 --> 01:31:48,880

years ago 20 years ago 15 years ago and

2299
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:52,360

covered a lot

2323
01:32:45,040 --> 01:32:50,080
but I know there's other things to cover

2324
01:32:48,320 --> 01:32:53,360
and we're going to have to keep on doing

2325
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:55,960
this stuff and doing this stuff okay so

2326
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:57,639
listen some other tips okay probiotics

2327
01:32:55,960 --> 01:32:59,639
you can take a regular probiotic any

2328
01:32:57,639 --> 01:33:01,080
kind of probiotic you want you can take

2329
01:32:59,639 --> 01:33:04,119
the ones you know they're soil born

2330
01:33:01,080 --> 01:33:07,679
microorganisms you take other probiotics

2331
01:33:04,119 --> 01:33:11,480
um I'm okay with that I'm okay with that

2332
01:33:07,679 --> 01:33:13,040
of course they're not totally unhelpful

2333
01:33:11,480 --> 01:33:15,159
okay so there's a couple of them that I

2334
01:33:13,040 --> 01:33:17,000
do have on my website that I like I

2335
01:33:15,159 --> 01:33:19,280
think there's a couple there they're not

great one that I've I've talked about on

2364
01:34:23,639 --> 01:34:27,719
and off think about herbal teas very

2365
01:34:26,320 --> 01:34:29,239
important nettle Leaf teas an

2366
01:34:27,719 --> 01:34:31,400
anti-inflammatory for the intestinal

2367
01:34:29,239 --> 01:34:33,560
tract because it squatches down some of

2368
01:34:31,400 --> 01:34:35,119
the bacteria it's also has alkaloids

2369
01:34:33,560 --> 01:34:37,159
that are anti-inflammatory so nettle

2370
01:34:35,119 --> 01:34:41,000
leaf tea lemon bomb tea kills off strep

2371
01:34:37,159 --> 01:34:44,280
ausy coli C diff staff and even fste bar

2372
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:46,320
virus lemon balb te for the intestinal

2373
01:34:44,280 --> 01:34:47,920
tract that's fine one more thing I think

2374
01:34:46,320 --> 01:34:50,000
I want to leave you with be cautious on

2375
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:51,440
all the cleansings all on the intestinal

2376
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:53,280
tract cleansings that are out there CLE

2377
01:34:51,440 --> 01:34:55,520
cleansers and cleansing programs and

2378
01:34:53,280 --> 01:34:57,320
everything else be cautious even if one

2379
01:34:55,520 --> 01:34:59,440
did you pretty good don't keep on doing

2380
01:34:57,320 --> 01:35:02,080
it over and over again just try to eat

2381
01:34:59,440 --> 01:35:03,760
more leafy greens try to get more leafy

2382
01:35:02,080 --> 01:35:06,119
greens and more fruits in your diet over

2383
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:08,760
time it'll do more than than a 30-day

2384
01:35:06,119 --> 01:35:12,000
cleanse because the 30-day cleanses put

2385
01:35:08,760 --> 01:35:13,760
your adrenals under arrest they put they

2386
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:15,679
put dur rest or they put them under

2387
01:35:13,760 --> 01:35:17,480
stress I mean they put the adrenals

2388
01:35:15,679 --> 01:35:19,080
under stress they put the LI this liver

2389
01:35:17,480 --> 01:35:21,040
does not like to be cleansed and purged

2390
01:35:19,080 --> 01:35:23,040
and pushed like that so it puts the

2391
01:35:21,040 --> 01:35:26,080
liver on under massive stress it puts

2392
01:35:23,040 --> 01:35:27,800
the kidneys under massive stress it puts

2393
01:35:26,080 --> 01:35:29,480
all those different programs I don't

2394
01:35:27,800 --> 01:35:31,199
