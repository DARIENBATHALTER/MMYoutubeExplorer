00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,080
an actual physical pill

77
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:41,200

come up with

93
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,480
i'm not saying people get off their

94
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,920
medications if they're on their

95
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,920
medications you talk to your doctor so

96
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:25,760
i'm saying they give you a physical pill

97
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,400
a physical drug

98
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:32,239
for a problem the system doesn't even

99
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:34,159
believe is a physical problem now what's

100
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,720
wrong with that picture there

101
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:38,720
a physical drug

102
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,480
right so you've got your antidepressants

103
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,400
one day the antidepressant is in here

104
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,480
with your your anti-anxiety med right

105
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,560
here you bend it benzo your benzo's in

106
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,159
here with that and then here same thing

107
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,000
they're mixed you got that each day i'm

108
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,599
going to take my anti-anxieties my hands

109
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,120

110
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,799
with benzos all that i'm going to take

111
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,200
them each day

112
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:59,040
okay but i don't have a physical problem

113
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,560
wrong with me because the doctor can't

114
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,480
find anything wrong with me so there's

115
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,159
nothing physical wrong with me but i'm

116
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,439
taking all these physical pills and

117
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:08,319
medications is what i'm doing

118
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,720
that's

119
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:13,040
what's interesting right

120
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,040
and then

121
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,400
the funny thing is alternative medicine

122
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,199
okay

123
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:23,120
alternative medicine

124
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,880
well there's nothing wrong with you

125
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,880
nothing shows up

126
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,560
nothing we can see that's wrong with you

127
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,800
in your head

128
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,479

routine going and make sure that's right

133
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,360
because you're obviously creating it so

134
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,120
in the alternative medicine world that

135
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,560
you're creating it

136
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,479
you're creating it

137
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,880
the spiritual world you're creating it

138
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:54,720

you're creating it

141
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:02,000
because it can't be a physical problem

142
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,039
because it's not a physical issue

143
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,840
right

144
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:07,919

00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,720
they're misunderstood their conditions

189
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,960
are completely misunderstood that's for

190
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,120
sure right

191
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,199
their conditions are misunderstood

192
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,800
they're misunderstood with this

193
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:01,039
been happening for years they're just

194
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,479
it's they're nicer about it now though

195
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,639
right

196
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:07,120
but

197
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:10,240
so if it's not supposed to be a physical

198
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:12,240
problem whatsoever whatever mysterious

199
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,000
unexplained

200
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,759
mental health issue you're suffering

201
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
from

202
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:21,120
if it's not supposed to be a physical

203
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,960
problem what is it

204
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,800
just a bad person you haven't mastered

205
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,880
your mind you haven't mastered your

206
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:30,479
thoughts good

207
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:34,479
maybe you're weak is that what it is

208
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:36,400
faulty how about that one maybe faulty

209
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:39,919
it's none of that it's not at all

210
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,919
there's a real physical issue

211
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,160
the system doesn't want to know about

212
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,720
the real physical issues

213
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,160
right i'm putting some onion in here

214
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,440
okay guys i don't know if you guys can

215
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,000
see that right there

216
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:54,479
making lentil tacos

217
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,000
i'm putting some uh about a half cup of

218
00:07:54,479 --> 00:08:00,400
veggie broth in here with the onion

219
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,000
i'm gonna get that in there

220
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,000
a little bit of vegetable broth right

221
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:08,319
so we'll get these we'll get these going

222
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,800
this is an amazing dish to tastes

223
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,240
incredible

224
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,800
we got the lettuce because that's gonna

225
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:20,240
be part of the recipe you put the

226
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:22,960
taco dish into the lettuce boats right

227
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,960
just like this

228
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:30,560
so we're made to feel

229
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:34,080
like there's something wrong with us

230
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:36,159
right as a person maybe something wrong

231
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,719
with who we are

232
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:40,959
so if we get this unexplainable mystery

233
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:43,760
condition this unexplainable mystery

234
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:47,040
anxiety issue right so your anxiety is

235
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:49,839
not physical no it's not but here's you

236
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,519
better get the anti anxiety medication

237
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:54,480
we're gonna give you a physical drug to

238
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:56,399
try to alter something in here but it's

239
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,160
not physical that's what they say so

240
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,800
conventional medicine is you don't have

241
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:03,360
a physical problem but let's do a

242
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:05,920
physical drug to try to alter

243
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:09,440
what alter what you're doing a physical

244
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:11,600
drug to alter my soul

245
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,440
you're doing a physical drug so is that

246
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,279
what it is we need a physical drug i'm

247
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,000
going to take a physical drug to alter

248
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:20,000
my soul what

249
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,880
like what it is so there's nothing wrong

250
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,880
with us physically

251
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:28,000
so oh i'm going to take a physical drug

252
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,519
to change me emotionally

253
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,200
i don't understand

254
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,959
if it's not physical why do we need a

255
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,000
physical drug

256
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:37,680
to try to change us

257
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,800
not physically

258
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,959
because that's what they're saying right

259
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:45,279
thoughts run on electricity every

260
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:48,800
thought you think

261
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:51,839
right is running on electricity keep

262
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,839
that in mind all right

263
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,160
so every thought you think is running on

264
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,399
electricity

265
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,720
it's in the electricity so your thoughts

266
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,000
actually in it's wired into the

267
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,959
electricity

268
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,839
that whole electrical grid right so

269
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,519
if

270
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,279
something's happening and you got the

271
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:11,680
ocd and something's happening or you got

272
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:13,920
the depression and that electricity is

273
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,240
circulating around your brain and you

274
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:19,360
got that unexplainable

275
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:21,279
unexplained mystery depression then you

276
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,360
got that mystery anxiety and you got

277
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:27,440
that mystery condition

278
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:30,000
then something is physically wrong

279
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:32,000
it's just that science is decades and

280
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,680
decades behind

281
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,959
the medical research and science doesn't

282
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,120
know

283
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,560
they don't know so they play guessing

284
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,640
games

285
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:43,839
so they try to drug

286
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:45,360
the person's brain right

287
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,360
so now

288
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,200
you know you don't have a physical

289
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:52,959
problem but we're going to physically

290
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,560
drug your brain to try to alter it

291
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,000
think about that does that make any

292
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,240
sense but you don't have a physical

293
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,800
problem

294
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:03,200
you know but we're gonna try to

295
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:05,920
physically change your brain

296
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:09,680
with a physical drug

297
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:11,920
but no you don't have a physical problem

298
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,200
because it's all in your mind

299
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,760
maybe you're just you need some

300
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:18,079
attention maybe you're just making it up

301
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,760
maybe you know you're just you're just

302
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:20,800
looking

303
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,680
just

304
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:26,720
you're you're looking for attention

305
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,720
it's all in your head

306
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,320
maybe it's all in your head

307
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,200
but it's not there's real physical

308
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,560
reasons why people are suffering from

309
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,120
anxiety

310
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,399
and ocd and bipolar

311
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,040
and mania

312
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:45,120
and depression neurosis and psychosis

313
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,279
and anything else or anything like that

314
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,760
there's real physical reasons why we're

315
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,880
actually struggling with all this

316
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,480
and

317
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,240
they throw out well

318
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,160
and here's the thing too i think people

319
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,440
over the years like patients over the

320
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,800
years they've gotten kind of wise to

321
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,880
that a little bit like wolf there's

322
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,680
nothing wrong with me

323
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:05,760
what is it what is it doctor

324
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,079
well we're told to say it could be a

325
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,440
chemical imbalance but we don't know the

326
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:13,680
chemicals and we don't know what's

327
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:17,279
imbalanced and no i we don't really know

328
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,279
you need to see a psychiatrist

329
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,839
right

330
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:24,959
the psychiatrist

331
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:26,720
will talk to you and find out if you're

332
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,639
crazy or not

333
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,000
is that how it works all these years

334
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:33,680
psychiatrists will talk to you to find

335
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,680
out if you're crazy or not and then

336
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,720
prescribe you a drug

337
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:41,440
like well

338
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,120
we're going to give you this drug

339
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,720
and see if that helps

340
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,399
because your depression

341
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:50,000
doesn't seem to be because you're

342
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:51,920
unhappy or you've got an unhappy life or

343
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,600
however it is your depression's really

344
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:55,680
severe

345
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,760
it's really clinical

346
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,880
so we're gonna need but there's nothing

347
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,560
wrong with you physically but we're

348
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:03,959
gonna need to make sure you're on a nice

349
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,959
strong antidepressant

350
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,279
but what the psychiatrist doesn't

351
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,839
understand and what the doctor doesn't

352
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,839
understand

353
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:18,320
there is something going on

354
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,320
there's a reason

355
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,760
why you're struggling there's a reason

356
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,760
why

357
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,120
you're living with this condition and

358
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,519
you're struggling like there's a real

359
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:30,639
reason it's there

360
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:31,760
it exists it's inside the brain

361
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,880
okay

362
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:37,600
problems happen inside our brain

363
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,680

00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,639
kind of mental health routine right the

427
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,839
next thing you know it's all about that

428
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:09,279

429
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:11,120

430
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:13,600
medical medium podcasts at apple podcast

soul

but let's not pretend

434
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:24,639
there's no physical problems happening

435
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:26,639
inside your brain even after

436
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:29,120
some trauma emotionally because

437
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:31,279
emotional trauma can cause damage to

438
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,720
brain tissue that science research

439
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:34,800
doesn't even know about or anybody else

440
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,959
knows about

441
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,880

depressed they can't do a meditation and

450
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,639

00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,240
someone who's severely anxiety written

454
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:05,439

456
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,880

the ground going to the emergency room

507
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,640
[Music]

508
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,520
so

509
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,320
i'm going to pop some garlic in here

510
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,640
see

511
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:55,280
basically what it is is

512
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,559
nobody knows why anybody's sick with all

513
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:59,600
these symptoms

514
00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:02,640
unexplained emotional health disorders

515
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,919
and health challenges and health issues

516
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,600
emotional

517
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:08,320
mental

518
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:11,360
all of it nobody knows why so it's put

519
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:13,280
on you you created it or you are

520
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:16,000
creating it i'm popping some garlic in

521
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:19,280
here the alternative movement is really

522
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,559
just getting ridiculous with this

523
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,000
because

524
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:23,600
of course the alternative movement

525
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,039
doesn't know why anybody's sick with

526
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,039
things because we know that medical

527
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:29,280
medium information has already shown

528
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:31,440
that all these years right

529
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,400
by providing answers

530
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,799
but

531
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:37,200
it's all blamed on everybody who has any

532
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,200
kind of

533
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:42,000
mental health challenge

534
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:45,760
of any kind struggle

535
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,760
disorder diagnosis

536
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,240
well i got depression so i better see

537
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:54,160
this new practitioner new practitioners

538
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:56,480
telling me to go to this go do this um

539
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:58,480
you know

540
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:02,320
go do these

541
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,320
techniques try these different things

542
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:06,400
everybody's overlooking a physical

543
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:08,080
problem is what i'm saying because you

544
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,240
can take somebody

545
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:12,240
who's never had to do anything for their

546
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,480
their their mental health they've never

547
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,640
had to do any kind of mental health

548
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,760
exercises they've never had to do any

549
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,440
kind of

550
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,840
meditation

551
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,919
i know people 75 80 years old they're

552
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,840
like what's that is that some newfangled

553
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:28,080
thing some new age thing i'm like no

554
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,360
everybody does all kinds of stuff i mean

555
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,200
they're like well i never needed to do

556
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,200
that that's because you don't you you're

557
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,480
not struggling with something physically

558
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,840
that someone else is struggling with

559
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:39,200
some something physically so they're

560
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,200
sent on a wild goose chase

561
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,080
i like meditations to heal the soul

562
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,480
soul healing

563
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,400
you can do that when you're struggling

564
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,679
with a physical problem

565
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,960
you can do that when you're struggling

566
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:56,960
without a physical problem

567
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:02,720
but we can't just package everything up

568
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,240
and say it's on you

569
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,960
burnout

570
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,799
is a physical problem burn out

571
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,679
mental burnout

572
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:13,039
brain burnout that's a physical problem

573
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:14,640
okay

574
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:16,559
it is it's a physical problem it's not

575
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,159
because you're weak

576
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:20,159
because that's another thing anybody who

577
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:23,039
gets burnt out

578
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:24,640
they're told that they're just weak well

579
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:26,000
you need a vacation

580
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,400
and then what happens when you're on

581
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,120
vacation or taking a break for six

582
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:34,240
months or leave of absence somewhere and

583
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:35,440
you're still not better what's what um

584
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,400
you know what i mean

585
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:40,320
physical things happen that cause us to

586
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:43,200
get burnt out or symptoms of burnout

587
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:44,400
brain fog

588
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:48,000
and we're going to go into that a little

589
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:49,600
bit you guys we're just talking about

590
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,440
what's happening if you just came on

591
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,960
here just you know watch this from the

592
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,960
beginning if you can but we're talking

593
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:58,400
about here it is so your depression is

594
00:21:54,960 --> 00:22:00,799
not physical but take a physical drug

595
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:03,039
does that make any sense your anxiety is

596
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:04,640
not physical but take an anti-anxiety

597
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:07,360
med

598
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:09,120
your bipolar is not physical at all no

599
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:11,280
that's just you

600
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:13,280
that's just you that's you being faulty

601
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:17,200
that's you being problematic that's you

602
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:17,200
creating it or maybe you're just cracked

603
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:24,720
and if you have mania and bipolar or

604
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,320
you're struggling with any kind of

605
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,720
emotional

606
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:30,480
mental disorder on any level that's you

607
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,480
just being crazy because we've done all

608
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,919
the mris and there's nothing wrong with

609
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,159
there's nothing wrong with you

610
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:37,760
physically

611
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:39,360
so we're going to try to take a bunch of

612
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,840
different physical drugs as you're in

613
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,760
that mental clinic

614
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,360
and we're gonna have to we're gonna have

615
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,760
to do a whole bunch of physical drugs to

616
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:49,360
try to calm you down we'll try to drug

617
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,880
you here then we'll try to make sure

618
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:53,200
there's plenty of antidepressants here

619
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:55,440
we'll do some sedating drugs here how

620
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,960
many people get tossed into clinics and

621
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,320
they're stuck in there and they're on

622
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,080
all these drugs

623
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:02,159
here's the sad part

624
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,919
they have a real physical problem that's

625
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:06,880
never addressed or never understood

626
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:08,799
nobody nobody knows what it is

627
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:11,280
and so they're just giving all these

628
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:14,240
physical drugs to try to like

629
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:17,280
balance their crazy

630
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,280
they're not crazy

631
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,080
they're suffering they're struggling

632
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,360
they're not crazy they're suffering and

633
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,280
struggling

634
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:28,880
with real

635
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,880
physical issues in the brain

636
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,520
so i'm just cooking this down a little

637
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,200
bit now i'm gonna add some seasonings

638
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,880
but i think i'm gonna put some lentils

639
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,880
in here it's time to pop some lentils in

640
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:41,919
some green lentils right here you guys

641
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:43,600
so these are lentil tacos i'm making

642
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:45,360
i haven't done any real cooking in a

643
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:50,080
while here

644
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:52,240
on camera so i'm gonna put some in here

645
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,559
there you go

646
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:57,360
got some lentils in there i'm gonna pop

647
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:59,120
some seasonings in here too

648
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,880
a little bit of paprika

649
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:03,360
right let's run through this a little

650
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:06,080
bit of cayenne these lentils are already

651
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:07,039
cooked keep that in mind they're already

652
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,120
cooked

653
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:11,520
don't pop in some hard lentils in there

654
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,880
right it's chili powder right

655
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:16,400
poulty powder

656
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:18,799
um cumin a little cumin in there

657
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,960
now i don't have poultry seasoning today

658
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:22,480
and it calls for poultry seasoning so

659
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,400
i'm gonna throw a little bit of thyme in

660
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:27,120
here

661
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,720
let's do my own poultry seasoning right

662
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,159
and i'm gonna put a little bit of sage

663
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:33,159
in here

664
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:33,159
boom

665
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:37,919
mari says so i just finished the detox

666
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:40,799
with tony robbins and life mastery first

667
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:43,279
time ever in years i'm not fatigued and

668
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:45,440
i have no brain fog you are an angel

669
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:47,679
mind blown so you did the medical medium

670
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,360
cleanse during tony robbins yeah i was

671
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:50,960
there i was there mari you were there

672
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:53,360
too incredible

673
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:57,120
yeah we were doing

674
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:59,120
um the medical medium cleanse right

675
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:02,320
for life mastery

676
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:06,159
and that cleanse is really powerful

677
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:08,080
i designed it for tony robbins

678
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:10,400
and sage

679
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,400
and

680
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:15,120
designed it for life mastery and i was

681
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,000
there it was fun it was incredible

682
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,600
actually

683
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
i'm glad it helped you that's that's

684
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,000
amazing

685
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:26,640
so what happens is that we

686
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:28,880
get thrown away

687
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,080
as far as like wait there has to be

688
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,760
something wrong with me physically you

689
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,919
know there isn't let's throw let's throw

690
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:35,760
that away let's throw you away

691
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:36,960
but there is something physically wrong

692
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,960
if you're struggling if you're

693
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,559
struggling with panic and anxiety or

694
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:44,080
years of it

695
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:45,600
and ocd and depression

696
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:48,400
i'm going to put a little bit of salt in

697
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:50,720
here now with salt you guys know

698
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:53,200
you don't see salt usually with me on

699
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:55,440
any level because everybody over salts

700
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,760
themselves they salt themselves they

701
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:00,960
dehydrate themselves they pickle

702
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,679
themselves they with vinegar and salt

703
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,200
they

704
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:05,840
you know the whole bit basically they

705
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,919
become salted the salt actually builds

706
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:10,080
up and deposits if you do too much of it

707
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:13,039
a little bit of salt on a recipe here

708
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,039
and there once in a while

709
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:19,919
it's not it's not a scary thing

710
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,919
like once every couple of weeks i'll use

711
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:24,400
a little tiny bit of it if i want a

712
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:26,880
little bit of that but the problem is

713
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,320
people just dump a lot of it in and they

714
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,760
have it in everything they're eating

715
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,120
every single thing they're eating has

716
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,640
salt in it

717
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,320
they're just salted out they're just

718
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,880
pickling their liver pickling their

719
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:38,320
organs dehydrating themselves and you've

720
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:41,760
got to be cautious with all that so i

721
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:42,880
just put a little tiny bit in there

722
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:45,200
okay

723
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:47,679
and i'm going to plate this up

724
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,360
i got some honey over here too

725
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:52,360
i was thinking about putting that in

726
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,360
maybe

727
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,200
so

728
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:57,919
i was going to let me put a little bit

729
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,919
of honey in here

730
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,640
there we go

731
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:08,240
we're led to believe

732
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,640
that

733
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:13,279
we're just

734
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,960
a bad unit

735
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:16,000
that's our fault that we're struggling

736
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,559
with this

737
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,799
mental condition

738
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:23,520
that if we don't get our crap together

739
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:26,720
we could you know

740
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:27,919
we're just gonna get more crazier

741
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,000
first of all

742
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:32,480
no one's crazy

743
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,559
they're physically injured

744
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:37,200
they're physically injured

745
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:40,080
it's just that science and research in

746
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:42,320
the medical world doesn't know this at

747
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:44,399
all they don't know the subtle injuries

748
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:46,559
that can't be seen

749
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:48,159
can't see hardly anything with an mri in

750
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:51,440
a brain

751
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:51,440
besides a big tumor

752
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,279
so i'm going to plate this up

753
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,760
besides

754
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:58,760
things like that

755
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:06,880

this is a fat free a radical fat free

794
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:54,080
dish

795
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:56,720

796
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:58,640

okay

798
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:03,520
i see it every day people

799
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:05,279
trying to keep their weight down

800
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:07,279
they get older they can't keep the

801
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:09,600
weight down

802
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:12,480
every day they're exercising can keep

803
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,480
the weight down

804
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:17,039
one of the reasons they got a tired

805
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:20,080
liver and they're shoving down the fat

806
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:22,480
everywhere they can avocados nuts and

807
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:25,120
seeds nut butters chicken meat

808
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:28,640
fish oils everywhere and they're told

809
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:28,640
it's fine and they're just like

810
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:35,440
and i call it fatting yourself to death

811
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,279
but there's no fat in this dish

812
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,799
and that's a big deal if there's no fat

813
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:41,039
in this dish your liver is not

814
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:43,760
overburdened it can get a chance to heal

815
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:45,440

816
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:48,240

i'm gonna put this right here

876
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:08,799
the more aluminum you get inside your

877
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:10,880
brain

878
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:11,919

00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,880
okay

880
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:14,880
the more mercury

881
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,320
you get inside your brain

882
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:23,279
what does that say right there

883
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:26,240
what's that say you guys

884
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:28,480
i'm hoping it's not backwards

885
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,600
fish oil

886
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,279
okay

887
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,919
one of the worst things ever a

888
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:36,000
practitioner or doctor or anybody could

889
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:39,200
recommend anybody to take

890
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,519
that's your ticket to alzheimer's

891
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:43,480
that's your ticket to alzheimer's land

892
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:46,080
dementia land sure you might be

893
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:47,200
industrial feeling now 20 years old i'm

894
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:50,159
never going to get alzheimer's i'm

895
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:53,519
taking my fish oil capsules i feel fine

896
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:55,120
you'll be there you'll be there

897
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:58,640
it's on the rise everybody's getting

898
00:33:55,120 --> 00:34:00,640
alzheimer's if you live long enough

899
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:02,399
for alzheimer's to happen and not die of

900
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:04,000
something else earlier because that's

901
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:04,799
how it's bad it's getting out there now

902
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,399
right

903
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:08,240
but

904
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:11,119
stay away from fish oil

905
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:12,720
that fish oil those fish oil capsules

906
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:14,159
krill oil

907
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:16,480
whatever

908
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:18,320
will take you into the badlands severe

909
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:20,000
depression down the road anxiety

910
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:23,119
everything else that's mercury in the

911
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,720
brain right it's mercury

912
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:26,879
parkinson's

913
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:28,399
so medical medium

914
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:30,079
put out the first

915
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:31,599
pieces of truth and information about

916
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:34,159
parkinson's disease

917
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:36,240
and said that it was copper toxic heavy

918
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:38,159
metals and guess what science of

919
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,679
research says that parkinson's is

920
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:42,560
genetic

921
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:45,440
but there's a big lawsuit out there

922
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:48,560
because parkinson's is linked to

923
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:50,960
dangerous pesticides hmm i thought

924
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:54,000
parkinson's was genetic

925
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:56,399
i thought parkinson's was uh

926
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,400
genetic because that's what they say

927
00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:00,240
but meanwhile there's a big lawsuit

928
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,839
because it's linked to dangerous

929
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:04,000
pesticides parkinson's and do you know

930
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:05,200
why because medical medium

931
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,560
knew this all along because i've talked

932
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,560
about it over and over again it's almost

933
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:10,880
like where they even get the information

934
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:12,079
maybe they got it for medical medium

935
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,960
but

936
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:18,480
because in pesticides

937
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:19,440
there's toxic heavy metals mercury

938
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:23,440
copper

939
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:26,800
and they use mercury in pesticides right

940
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:28,240
to short-circuit and kill bugs

941
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:30,400
and rodents and stuff like that it's

942
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:32,240
toxic heavy metal so aluminum are in

943
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,480
pesticides too

944
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,480
so

945
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:40,240
you guys are doing your colognes and

946
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:42,320
perfumes

947
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:45,839
how do you like the smell of pesticide

948
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,839
it smells good right

949
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,920
i don't want to i don't want to spray it

950
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,880
this time one time i opened up the cap i

951
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,640
don't know if you guys remember and i

952
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:54,480
sprayed it right in my face and maybe it

953
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,359
was a tick-tock video or something oh my

954
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,280
god

955
00:35:55,359 --> 00:36:00,960
i mean it just stayed in the house for

956
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,960
like three weeks

957
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:05,040
right

958
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:08,160
so the toxic heavy metals settle in the

959
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:09,599
brain okay and then we get

960
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:11,440
lots of toxic heavy metals from

961
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:13,599
pharmaceuticals

962
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:15,280
of all kinds

963
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:17,200
pharmaceuticals

964
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,480
of all kinds though

965
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:20,320
let me think

966
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,560
what's a pharmaceutical

967
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:24,320
um

968
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:26,960
cold medicines yeah that's

969
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:29,280
pharmaceutical um

970
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:33,359
uh what else just trying to think

971
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:33,359
antibiotics pharmaceuticals right

972
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:37,599
what else

973
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,560
can you use your imagination

974
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:42,240
what's

975
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:42,240
what's the hot topics of today

976
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:46,640
trying to remember

977
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,640
hmm

978
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:52,240
metals and lots of it so we get metals

979
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:54,160
from that so if we have a history of

980
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,359
that recreational drugs too metals and

981
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,240
that

982
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:59,359
man

983
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:02,000
weed is coated in metals i'm not saying

984
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:03,760
you do it's your life do what you want

985
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,480
do what you want it's your life

986
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:07,359
but weeds saturated with metals

987
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,160
okay

988
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:12,320
sure this weed is organic oh yeah i'd

989
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:14,720
like to watch you guys grow it

990
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:16,720
and check it out at the farm site let me

991
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:20,160
see what you're putting in there

992
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:22,800
because from what i've heard out there

993
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:26,079
it ain't kosher

994
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,079
okay of what they do

995
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:31,440
so

996
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:34,400
point is is like metals are everywhere

997
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:36,960
we can get it in every place every way

998
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:39,440
possible we can get the metals so the

999
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,880
metals build up

1000
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,920
and i showed you guys i said the other

1001
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,880
day

1002
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:46,480
they sit on neurons that's a neuron it's

1003
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,839
a pencil

1004
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:50,079
by the way

1005
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:52,480
the paint in a pencil if you've ever

1006
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:54,000
bitten a pencil right all the pencil

1007
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:56,560
biting okay

1008
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,960
that paint is filled with metal

1009
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:00,800
the lacquer is metal meaning there's

1010
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:02,480
metal particles in the lacquer so if

1011
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,640
you're chewing on if you're biting your

1012
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:06,960
pencils

1013
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:09,680
some people do you bite the eraser

1014
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:11,920
that's the aluminum end right there

1015
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:14,880
the eraser's got metal in it

1016
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:18,160
so that's another thing too

1017
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:19,839
so your neurons get metal on them this

1018
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:22,079
is a neuron inside your brain there's

1019
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:24,000
the metal inside there and then

1020
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:25,440
electricity is trying to run over that

1021
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,599
metal it's trying to run through that

1022
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:29,599
metal it's hitting that metal if the

1023
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:31,680
metal deposit is big enough the

1024
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:34,480
electricity bounces back and what's in

1025
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:36,320
your electricity is your thoughts

1026
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:38,560
your thoughts

1027
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:40,000
right so when it comes down to ocd

1028
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:41,599
you've got terrible thoughts going on

1029
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,960
because a lot of people suffer with ocd

1030
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:44,640
they got these bad thoughts and they

1031
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:47,440
just can't shake them and the thoughts

1032
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:49,280
keep on recirculating like

1033
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:51,200
something bad's gonna happen and

1034
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:53,040
something's bad is gonna happen and

1035
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,400
what's happening is

1036
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,760
and while they're going through that

1037
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,440
struggle with their thoughts and they're

1038
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:59,119
suffering with the whole ocd and the

1039
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:01,520
thought pattern right

1040
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:03,599
electrical signals electrical impulses

1041
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:06,000
are going down the neuron heading down

1042
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:08,480
real fast i'm going down slow real fast

1043
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,880
and they hit the metal deposits

1044
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:12,320
and then they bounce back

1045
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:14,880
sometimes they'll hit the metal deposit

1046
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:16,400
and just explode and diffuse

1047
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,599
this is advanced information medical

1048
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:20,000
medium

1049
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:22,720
and but a lot of times it hits

1050
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,079
and ricochets back as it's ricocheting

1051
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,599
back

1052
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:27,599
you've got another electrical impulse

1053
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:29,280
with a thought on it heading on down and

1054
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:32,640
they collide and when those two

1055
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:36,320
electrical impulses collide

1056
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:38,720
we got ocd and that thought never leaves

1057
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:40,480
starts to be obsessive starts to take

1058
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:43,280
over

1059
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:44,800
now you can have tiny bits of metal on

1060
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,560
your neurons so let's do that a little

1061
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:50,000
bit

1062
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:50,000
let's do tiny bits right

1063
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:56,280
not a lot of metal on your neurons tiny

1064
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:56,280
bits in different places

1065
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:00,720
so say your neuron is saturated with

1066
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:04,560
tiny bits of metal in different places

1067
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:06,960
inside the brain okay inside the brain

1068
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:09,119
the electrical impulse is hitting it

1069
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,560
and then bypassing it or going through

1070
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:12,720
it

1071
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:14,640
the information has been altered and

1072
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:16,960
changed

1073
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:18,880
send you into a depressive place

1074
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:20,640
unexplained sadness that can't be

1075
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,640
figured out like where is the origin of

1076
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:24,240
the sadness where's the origin of this

1077
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:26,880
depression where's the origin of this

1078
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:28,240
anxiety and it's not explained you guys

1079
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,920
just came on here this is all medical

1080
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:31,680
medium information medical medium

1081
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,040
doesn't use anybody else's information

1082
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:35,119
ever it's always been original and

1083
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:36,560
unique and instead everybody throughout

1084
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:38,000
the world including science has taken

1085
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:40,560
medical medium information after it's

1086
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,400
been published and they put it out there

1087
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:45,680
but mm info is always unique and

1088
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:48,240
original always has for 35 years

1089
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:49,920
and even longer since i was a kid

1090
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:53,839
so

1091
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,839
that metal on your neuron

1092
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:57,920
interferes with your thought process

1093
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:00,440
because your thought process is actually

1094
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:03,599
in an electrical field it's on the

1095
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:06,640
electricity it's in the electrical grid

1096
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:08,960
it's in the electrical impulse traveling

1097
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:10,640
down the neuron so you're going to end

1098
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,920
up with depression then you're going to

1099
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:14,240
end up with

1100
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:17,040
anxiety and then you're going to end up

1101
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:18,079
with brain fog and anything else

1102
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,839
involved

1103
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:22,880
anything else like that so this is

1104
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:22,880
really important to know

1105
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:27,520
that meal is helping my brain right now

1106
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:28,480
i didn't eat today

1107
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,760
much

1108
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:31,920
and

1109
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:35,040
so that meal just got me sparked up so

1110
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:36,400
now i'm like jazzed up right now

1111
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,599
okay

1112
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:40,640
so

1113
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:42,160
anxiety you got tightness to the chest

1114
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:44,079
you got tightness in the throat you feel

1115
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:45,520
like your throat's being strangled do

1116
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:47,280
you have any of that do you have what

1117
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:48,880
feels like butterflies flipping in your

1118
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:50,800
stomach your abdomen so you've got some

1119
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:52,319
flips in your abdomen and your stomach

1120
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,839
and you're getting the butterflies are

1121
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:56,079
you getting any of that

1122
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:58,000
what about panic attacks what about you

1123
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:59,359
can't feel like you can't breathe but

1124
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,839
everything's working and you're getting

1125
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:03,440
plenty of air right how many anxiety

1126
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:05,680
issues have people have do you feel like

1127
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:07,440
you can't sit still

1128
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:10,000
do you feel like you can't shake the

1129
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:11,520

00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,319
your teeth that's what you're dealing

with

1132

so

1133
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,520
is it hard to make a decision and you

1134
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:18,960
get all of a sudden an anxiety attack

1135
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:20,560
because you can't make a decision what

1136
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,400
about that you guys like you got this

1137
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:24,560
anxiety attack and you can't make a

1138
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:26,400
decision you have racing thoughts and

1139
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:28,000

right

1143
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:35,440
all this is happening because of the

1144
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:37,040
vagus nerve okay

1145
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:38,480
so the vegas

1146
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:40,800

book

1156
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:59,119
it's going to be a three-day cleanse

1157
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:01,119
challenge

1158
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:02,400
it is gonna be incredible it's gonna be

1159
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:05,520
just as incredible as the other

1160
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:07,680
challenges and maybe even better

1161
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:10,640
okay so we're talking about anxiety this

1162
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:10,640
is all medical medium

1163
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:17,200
information your vagus nerve

1164
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:19,599
your vagus nerves stemming out of the

1165
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:21,920
brain stem

1166
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:24,960
traveling down okay

1167
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:27,440
wrapping sending nerves to intestinal

1168
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:29,839
tract nerves to your heart

1169
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,839
all right

1170
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:34,319
what happens is when that vagus nerve is

1171
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:38,480
inflamed

1172
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:40,640
and inflamed by metals and viruses okay

1173
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:42,160
so when that nerve is inflamed by metals

1174
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:45,119
and viruses

1175
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:46,400
it gets in it it gets irritated and when

1176
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:48,160
it's irritated you're going to

1177
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:50,160
experience all these different symptoms

1178
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:52,560
tightness of chest

1179
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:55,520
okay tightness of throat

1180
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:56,319
weird sensations on your face and head

1181
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,839
okay

1182
00:43:56,319 --> 00:43:59,599
if you heard about vagus nerve

1183
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:01,200
information been teaching about it for

1184
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:03,280
decades

1185
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:04,960
and if you've heard about it anxiety

1186
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:07,680
involved it's medical medium info it's

1187
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:12,480
where it originated published first

1188
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:12,480
with phrenic nerves and vagus nerves

1189
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:18,480
so our vagus nerve gets inflamed it gets

1190
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:19,680
irritated

1191
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:22,160
irritable

1192
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:23,200
it swells and when that vagus nerve

1193
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:25,119
swells

1194
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:27,440
we get all the different anxiety

1195
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:29,520
symptoms but it makes you more

1196
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:31,200
susceptible to trigger so if someone

1197
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:32,560
gives you bad news or if someone

1198
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:34,319
stresses you out or you're in a

1199
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:36,720
relationship and there's a problem in

1200
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:38,400
the relationship or you're you run into

1201
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:40,079
confrontation you're gonna get more

1202
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:42,240
anxiety than someone else does because

1203
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:44,720
the vagus nerve is inflamed

1204
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:46,960
and when the vagus nerve is inflamed

1205
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:50,160
you're gonna be more triggered easy

1206
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:51,599
more sensitive and that includes

1207
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:53,760
you know a lot of different things that

1208
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:55,280
can happen with that trigger so we just

1209
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:57,359
made the lentil tacos we're talking

1210
00:44:55,280 --> 00:45:01,520
about real reasons why people have

1211
00:44:57,359 --> 00:45:05,599
anxiety and depression ocd bipolar so

1212
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:06,800
we'll talk about bipolar for a second

1213
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:09,119
up and down

1214
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:10,800
everybody being like all over the place

1215
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:12,800
so

1216
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:15,040
you got the neurons and you got the

1217
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,839
metal on the neurons okay

1218
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:17,200
and

1219
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:19,280
bipolar

1220
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:22,000
is when

1221
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:24,560
the electrical impulse

1222
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:26,640
diffuses so as electrical impulse is

1223
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:29,200
traveling down the neuron and it hits

1224
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:31,520
metal it's diffusing

1225
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:34,240
so you end up getting lows

1226
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:36,800
so now you're really low and there comes

1227
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:38,000
it comes a point where an override

1228
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,359
occurs

1229
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,280
that means

1230
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:43,599
not enough thought power

1231
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:45,680
going to the right direction because

1232
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:47,920
it's being interfered with so the

1233
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:49,359
electrical impulse is diffusing too much

1234
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:52,000
and too long

1235
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:53,839
after hours of this diffusing process

1236
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,000
and maybe even a day or two this

1237
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:56,880
defusing process and you're down in this

1238
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,760
low

1239
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:01,760
this bipolar low

1240
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:04,560
a reversal occurs

1241
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:07,040
all of a sudden the brain gets heated up

1242
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:09,680
the electrical charge gets really strong

1243
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:11,760
to try to fix the problem and override

1244
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:14,160
the injury so then all of a sudden the

1245
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:17,599
electrical is bright and strong so the

1246
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:19,760
electrical grid gets really powered high

1247
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:22,560
and that high powered electrical grid is

1248
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:24,480
to fix the problem so it's our innate

1249
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:25,680
body's ability

1250
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:28,800
to

1251
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:31,599
fix and repair a problem okay

1252
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:33,280
so it ends up rushing through

1253
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:35,520
powering through

1254
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:37,119
and that grid is lit up for a day or

1255
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:38,480
hours and now you're on this high you're

1256
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:41,200
on this high you're on this high you're

1257
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:42,400
on this high until the heat gets so

1258
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:44,079
intense

1259
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:45,920
that it just shuts down and you're back

1260
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:49,760
to the lows lows lows it's advanced

1261
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:49,760
information medical medium information

1262
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:55,040
so

1263
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:57,920
back to one back to where we're talking

1264
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:59,520
about from the start so we get told

1265
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:00,560
that there's nothing physically wrong

1266
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:02,720
with us

1267
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:05,200
that it's us causing the problem and if

1268
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:08,400
you've got like mild depression mild

1269
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:09,520
anxiety or any kind of mild form of of a

1270
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:12,560
mental

1271
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:14,800
health challenge disorder struggle

1272
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:16,240
and it's mild you're definitely going to

1273
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:17,200
be convinced

1274
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:19,040
that

1275
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:21,280
it's just you just need a little work

1276
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:23,119
you need to get the mental health

1277
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:24,880
package right

1278
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:26,480
and that's really what it is it's me you

1279
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:28,160
know i'm the problem i gotta get the

1280
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:30,160

issue because everybody else they seem

1283
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:36,960
to be fine and i'm the one struggling

1284
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:38,960
but that's a trap

1285
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:40,559
you're actually perfect

1286
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:42,960

you're a good person there's just a

1291
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:53,359
physical injury that's not seen by

1292
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:56,319
alternative medicine not seen

1293
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:57,839
by conventional medicine

1294
00:47:56,319 --> 00:48:00,720
