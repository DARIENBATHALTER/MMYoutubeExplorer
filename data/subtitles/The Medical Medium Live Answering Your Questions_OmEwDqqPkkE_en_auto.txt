[88.16 - 92.40] matters it matters you guys have to
[90.80 - 96.00] remember your body
[92.40 - 98.16] wants to heal it's looking to heal
[96.00 - 99.92] and it wants to heal you always have to
[98.16 - 101.20] remember that i know that when you're
[99.92 - 104.48] going through it
[101.20 - 107.20] and you're sick or you've got a symptom
[104.48 - 108.96] or a diagnosis and you're struggling
[107.20 - 111.52] and you know you're just in it and
[108.96 - 114.88] you're in it for so long right
[111.52 - 116.72] i know when that happens that that it
[114.88 - 119.12] feels like you're not going to heal
[116.72 - 120.88] or it feels like how can i heal i still
[119.12 - 121.76] got these symptoms or my body is
[120.88 - 123.52] struggling
[121.76 - 125.20] and it feels like you're not going to
[123.52 - 128.32] get anywhere with it
[125.20 - 131.60] but the truth is your body
[128.32 - 132.08] wants to heal it just needs to tools to
[131.60 - 135.52] heal
[132.08 - 138.72] long enough it just needs enough tools
[135.52 - 139.44] in your tool chest to heal long enough
[138.72 - 142.24] meaning
[139.44 - 142.80] it just needs some tools applied and
[142.24 - 146.00] then them
[142.80 - 147.60] used long enough so you can heal
[146.00 - 149.36] it's such an important thing to know
[147.60 - 152.24] because your body
[149.36 - 152.64] your immune system is working for you
[152.24 - 154.64] it's
[152.64 - 156.80] working for you you just have to support
[154.64 - 158.48] it you have to acknowledge it
[156.80 - 160.56] you wake up in the morning feel like my
[158.48 - 163.04] immune system is working

[397.92 - 402.00] just covering a little bit
[399.20 - 403.84] those nerves are inflamed that's one
[402.00 - 405.36] thing that can happen the phrenic nerves
[403.84 - 407.12] the vagus nerve
[405.36 - 409.12] so that your anxiety nerves right there
[407.12 - 410.88] you get the nausea with it my god you
[409.12 - 412.64] can't get the nausea but that's the
[410.88 - 414.40] anxiety nerves right there you got the
[412.64 - 415.52] vagus nerve you got the phrenic nerves
[414.40 - 418.72] right you guys
[415.52 - 421.52] and anxiety is a neurological condition
[418.72 - 422.08] and it's from real things happening you
[421.52 - 423.84] know
[422.08 - 425.76] two things happening low-grade viral
[423.84 - 427.44] issue like having the epsine bar in your
[425.76 - 429.36] system all these years
[427.44 - 432.00] and the epstein-barr can release a
[429.36 - 433.76] neurotoxin the neurotoxin swells up the
[432.00 - 435.36] vagus nerve and phrenic nerves and then
[433.76 - 436.00] you're dealing with mystery anxiety and
[435.36 - 437.76] you're like oh my
[436.00 - 439.84] god what am i going to do i got panic
[437.76 - 443.76] attacks anxiety attacks right
[439.84 - 444.24] and then also toxic heavy metals can do
[443.76 - 446.88] it too
[444.24 - 448.40] mercury aluminum right mercury and
[446.88 - 449.92] aluminum we have them in our brain we
[448.40 - 451.36] have a monovagus nerve we have a
[449.92 - 453.04] monophrenic nerve we have them in our
[451.36 - 455.04] liver and that metal
[453.04 - 456.88] can also do it too these two things
[455.04 - 458.80] toxic heavy metals and viral issues and
[456.88 - 459.36] then there's emotional wounds too you
[458.80 - 461.28] guys
[459.36 - 464.56] you can get the anxiety from emotional
[461.28 - 467.76] hits emotional blows emotional bullets
[464.56 - 469.76] and betrayal broken trust
[467.76 - 471.76] getting your back stabbed getting you
[469.76 - 474.72] know getting like
[471.76 - 476.80] broken promises trust broken you know it
[474.72 - 478.16] could be divorces broken relationships
[476.80 - 481.68] broken friendships
[478.16 - 484.48] losses and then that heats up
[481.68 - 485.36] the emotional center of your brain so

[507.04 - 511.84] so that's anxiety and anxiousness i talk

[530.48 - 533.84] um
[531.52 - 536.48] but i gotta tell you those the emotional
[533.84 - 538.72] center of the brain the emotional core
[536.48 - 540.08] okay the emotional center of the brain
[538.72 - 542.24] it gets calloused
[540.08 - 544.64] because it heats up so it's like you get
[542.24 - 547.44] told something bad it's like hey
[544.64 - 549.04] oh my god what is this wait what ha
[547.44 - 550.32] what's going on this is terrible getting
[549.04 - 551.28] broken up with wait a minute you
[550.32 - 553.28] promised this
[551.28 - 554.64] i'm having a or having a dispute or
[553.28 - 556.64] something with a friendship with a
[554.64 - 559.60] friendship or a friend or whatever it is
[556.64 - 561.44] whatever gets sent your way or you read
[559.60 - 562.72] an email and it's disheartening whatever
[561.44 - 565.76] happens in your life you
[562.72 - 567.84] the the brain heats up it heats up right
[565.76 - 570.64] in the core just starts heating up
[567.84 - 572.40] and once it starts heating up then
[570.64 - 574.08] anything can go wrong and one of the
[572.40 - 577.28] things that goes wrong is from that
[574.08 - 579.68] constant heating you can get a little
[577.28 - 582.08] bit of a wear and tear
[579.68 - 583.52] on brain tissue on neurons on brain
[582.08 - 584.40] cells right in there in the emotional
[583.52 - 586.08] center of the brain
[584.40 - 587.68] and you get a little tiny callous they
[586.08 - 589.12] can heal up but
[587.68 - 591.76] but that's what goes on there i talk
[589.12 - 596.48] about in detail in the anxiety episode
[591.76 - 596.48] medical mean podcast at apple podcast um
[596.56 - 599.92] clarissa how to get rid of rosacea now
[599.12 - 602.48] you got to learn
[599.92 - 604.00] what rosacea is for what it's really
[602.48 - 606.32] important to know what it is
[604.00 - 608.00] and what's causing it and all that get a
[606.32 - 608.80] little bit of mercury in the intestinal
[608.00 - 610.64] tract
[608.80 - 612.48] go tell your doctor about that you know
[610.64 - 614.16] so they learn but you get a little
[612.48 - 617.04] he gets a little bit of strep in the
[614.16 - 618.88] system a little bit of ebv in the system
[617.04 - 620.48] so you know what happens is when people
[618.88 - 622.32] have bacteria and
[620.48 - 624.32] and viruses in their body and in their
[622.32 - 625.36] system they'll get the rosacea all over
[624.32 - 628.40] the place
[625.36 - 630.96] so that's that's the toxins at surface
[628.40 - 632.00] um toxic heavy metals are involved with
[630.96 - 635.20] that too
[632.00 - 637.76] um i mean if i had rosacea
[635.20 - 639.28] if i had any kind of rosacea stuff i
[637.76 - 641.20] would i would do
[639.28 - 642.88] probably like three six nine cleanse

[642.88 - 645.84] put a
[643.44 - 647.44] a friend that uh that contacted me with
[645.84 - 649.20] rosacea and they said how do i get rid
[647.44 - 651.36] of my rosacea and i was helping them out
[649.20 - 652.88] telling them what to do 369 cleanse they
[651.36 - 656.24] could do the original
[652.88 - 657.68] or the advanced one if they want um
[656.24 - 659.52] but you know you can do what you want to
[657.68 - 660.72] do and say what you want to do talk to
[659.52 - 663.20] your doctor too
[660.72 - 664.96] i you know and another thing is if i had
[663.20 - 666.64] rosacea i would make sure the gluten
[664.96 - 668.08] wasn't there right no gluten
[666.64 - 669.92] i would make sure that milk cheese
[668.08 - 674.08] butter milk
[669.92 - 676.56] cheese yogurt kefir butter
[674.08 - 678.96] sour cream i don't know i can't anything
[676.56 - 681.12] else i would make sure it's not there
[678.96 - 682.64] and you know it's gone i would make sure
[681.12 - 684.64] the eggs weren't there
[682.64 - 686.32] and i would start thinking about
[684.64 - 688.08] bringing in some of the foods that you
[686.32 - 689.68] see over there
[688.08 - 692.00] because i'm inviting you guys over to
[689.68 - 694.16] dinner to tick-tock live
[692.00 - 696.32] i'm going to answer questions thoroughly
[694.16 - 697.76] and i'm going to be making food so and
[696.32 - 698.96] it's soon too it's actually
[697.76 - 701.12] coming up pretty soon i'm going to go to
[698.96 - 702.80] ig and then go to there but
[701.12 - 704.56] that's what i would do rosacea is making
[702.80 - 705.76] sure that there's no there's no
[704.56 - 707.20] nutritional yeast
[705.76 - 709.52] because nutritional yeast will keep
[707.20 - 711.92] rosacea around i'm not saying you eat it
[709.52 - 715.12] but it might be in a packaged treat
[711.92 - 716.48] or it might be something you know that
[715.12 - 718.32] you're doing or in a
[716.48 - 719.68] in a restaurant dish just look out for
[718.32 - 722.08] nutritional yeast
[719.68 - 723.92] um that's one thing i would would kind
[722.08 - 726.48] of keep away from
[723.92 - 727.12] also kind of if you want another tip
[726.48 - 729.04] it's
[727.12 - 732.00] keeping your fats a little lower just
[729.04 - 734.88] try not to make your day all about fats
[732.00 - 736.24] and you know that's all these animal
[734.88 - 739.84] proteins all day long
[736.24 - 742.80] or all these plant fats all day long
[739.84 - 744.40] try not to keep the fat so high you know
[742.80 - 746.24] lower it a little bit if you want to get
[744.40 - 748.00] rid of rosacea
[746.24 - 749.44] that's important right there like what
[748.00 - 751.44] i'm saying is maybe do the medical
[749.44 - 754.64] medium morning cleanse
[751.44 - 756.80] celery juice uh lemon water first
[754.64 - 758.40] celery juice and maybe one of the
[756.80 - 760.72] medical medium smoothies
[758.40 - 763.12] uh maybe the heavy metal detox smoothie
[760.72 - 765.60] so you can you can get rid of things
[763.12 - 768.00] you can heal people heal thousands of
[765.60 - 770.48] people have
[768.00 - 771.20] a lot more than that actually for sure
[770.48 - 772.56] so yeah
[771.20 - 774.08] so much you know so you guys were
[772.56 - 775.68] heading over to tick tock that's where
[774.08 - 777.76] we're going pretty soon just giving you
[775.68 - 780.56] the 4-1-1 having
[777.76 - 781.76] having dinner the whole bit and you guys
[780.56 - 782.64] going to have dinner with me because i'm
[781.76 - 785.28] excited all right
[782.64 - 786.88] i'm excited about it because i'm gonna
[785.28 - 787.60] answer questions thoroughly and i got
[786.88 - 790.64] the food
[787.60 - 793.84] all getting ready over there so yeah
[790.64 - 795.52] anyway guys which brand of liquid
[793.84 - 799.28] vitamins do you recommend
[795.52 - 800.00] selena it's the vimergy it's the best
[799.28 - 802.64] one there is
[800.00 - 803.28] and out there without a doubt hands
[802.64 - 807.04] hands
[803.28 - 808.88] hands down um and that's the lemon balm
[807.04 - 809.28] right there says vimergy v is in victor
[808.88 - 812.96] i
[809.28 - 814.72] am as in mary e rgy that's their b12
[812.96 - 816.88] that's their liquid b12
[814.72 - 818.08] check them out vimrgy.com or go to
[816.88 - 820.56] medicalmeme.com
[818.08 - 822.08] uh the directory i got there it's
[820.56 - 824.32] definitely the best company ever
[822.08 - 825.44] i mean it just is do a little b12 right
[824.32 - 829.68] here
[825.44 - 831.52] but it's the best company um
[829.68 - 833.52] for a lot of reasons because they
[831.52 - 833.84] actually don't play that game where they
[833.52 - 836.16] put
[833.84 - 838.24] cheap stuff all the companies put cheap
[836.16 - 839.52] most almost every company puts cheap
[838.24 - 842.16] ingredients in
[839.52 - 842.96] and they're all about how many pennies
[842.16 - 845.28] they can
[842.96 - 846.48] save and then put out this product and
[845.28 - 848.56] it's really a game
[846.48 - 850.08] and it's terrible you know and they put
[848.56 - 851.52] other stuff in there and the whole bit
[850.08 - 853.44] it's just really a horrible thing this
[851.52 - 855.52] company doesn't do that
[853.44 - 857.84] anyway i'm not sponsored by the way i'm
[855.52 - 860.96] not sponsored i'm not a sales rep
[857.84 - 862.48] and i'm not sponsored i'm not sponsored
