1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,880
now we're talking about gallbladders

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:07,359
talking about adrenals kidneys

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,160
talk about kidney stones we're talking

4
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:09,760
about

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,360
lots of things we can talk about the

6
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:14,080
bladder too

7
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,920
but what we're going to talk about is

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,279
why

9
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:19,439
everyone thinks it's perfectly fine and

10
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:22,800
normal to have kidney stones and

11
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:25,519
gallbladder stones dysfunctional livers

12
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,000
dysfunctional kidneys adrenals that are

13
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:30,640
all burnt out we walk around and we

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,920
we just accept it or we don't know about

15
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,719
it and then when we learn a little bit

16
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,840
about it

17
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:37,200
we just accept it again or when we find

18
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,040
out we have a kidney stone or we have a

19
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,920
gallbladder stone

20
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,040
we think hey we better just eat a

21
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,039
certain way and it turns out that

22
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,640
certain way is actually disastrous for a

23
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:48,640
kidney stone gallbladder

24
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,239
a gallbladder stone it's interesting how

25
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,719
things work you guys i'm excited

26
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:53,440
this is the last day tomorrow's the last

27
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,719

two days of the mm-900 hds sale

29
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,239

00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,040
show you how it works the whole bit

36
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,200
there's no metal gears in here and metal

37
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,280
on metal which gives you those metal

38
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,439
shavings nobody sees because they're

39
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,799
microscopic shavings and then you get it

40
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:24,479
in your juices

41
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,720
none of that's in here which is really

00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:30,240
cool this is one bad

43
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:33,439
ass machine so anyway you want to be

44
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:36,079
on a device like a juicer

45
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:38,240
any juicer is fine right instead of a

46
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,920
medical device i told you about that too

47
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,000
you guys you don't want to be on other

48
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,159
medical devices because

49
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,520
you could have been doing other medical

50
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,119
devices like this

51
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,640
preventing you to be on other medical

52
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:51,040
devices right so

53
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,439

and eggs have you guys eaten

71
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,239
just just wondering how much cheese

72
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,560
butter and eggs

73
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:41,840

77
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,080
here in the medical medium kitchen

78
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,760
how many pizzas have you guys eaten

79
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,599
right

80
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,000
i'm not shaming anybody i'm not judging

81
00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:00,959
anybody nothing like that

82
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,879
nothing like that at all i'm just

83
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:06,000
thinking what are we doing

84
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:08,480
to reverse all those meals we

85
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,599
ate all those meals what are we doing to

86
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,840
reverse

87
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:14,720
all that build up all that sediment in

88
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,159
the gallbladder right

89
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,360
that's your liver right there that's

90
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,480
your gallbladder right here the

91
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,000
gallbladder

92
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:25,040
gets filled up with sludge and sediment

93
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,040
and sludge and more sediment more sludge

94
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,720
and it gets heavy so our gallbladders

95
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,040
get heavy and then we get stones

96
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:34,159
building up in there too

97
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:36,480
and a big part of that is

98
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:38,640
all the eggs we've done all those years

99
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,360
all the butter we do all those years

100
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,120
right anybody that says butter's healthy

101
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,840
i just i just have to laugh

102
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,920
i have to laugh i can't you know dr

103
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:51,120
nesbitt rescue us

104
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,120
i have to laugh because

105
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,200
butter is really a tough one on the body

106
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,760
real tough

107
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,360
okay burns out the liver feeds all the

108
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,519
viruses and bacteria

109
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,879
feeds everything proliferates everything

110
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,760
that's bad for us

111
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:09,040
but what it also does is it causes you

112
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,040
to lose calcium out of your bones

113
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,879
so we're all in the business of just

114
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,400
blowing our calcium reserves out left

115
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,320
and right that's what we do

116
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,919
we blow all of our calcium reserves out

117
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,320
left and right

118
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:21,120
that's how it works we acidify our

119
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,440
bodies

120
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,199

121
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,479

me i've had to buy

191
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,080
half the celery less half less celery

192
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,960
than i normally

193
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,160
buy so if i needed a case a week it's a

194
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,160
half a case

195
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,759
if you're somebody that needs a half a

196
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,000
bunch of celery

197
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,800
right a day then you're going to

198
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,400
basically

199
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,160
it's going to cut it down to a little

200
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,759
more than a quarter of celery you'll

201
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,199
need right a little more than a quarter

202
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,720
that's that's what i've been noticing

203
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,240
all this time so the juicer pays for

204
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,360
itself and pays for itself

205
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,400
if you're somebody that needs two

206
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,960
bunches a day then you're saving already

207
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:17,039
probably three quarters of a bunch

208
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,520
easy because it squeeze out so much

209
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,880
juice and then it adds up and it adds up

210
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,400
and then over the course of the year you

211
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,720
just bought yourself two new juicers

212
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,440
three

213
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,800
new juicers for free it paid for itself

214
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:30,160
cheryl said did all that

215
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,919
now i no longer have a gallbladder

216
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,000
which is why celery juice is important

217
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,599
all on its own you know for many years

218
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,960
people have come knocking on my door at

219
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:38,479
the office like i don't have a

220
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,240
gallbladder because i know

221
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:41,599
or i'd see they don't have a gallbladder

222
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,759
be like you know you're missing

223
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,960
your gallbladder right yeah i'm missing

224
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,039
my gallbladder

225
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,800
okay they take gallbladder pluck

226
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,680
gallbladders out of people left and

227
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,080
right

228
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,840
because they gotta they gotta pluck

229
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,479
gallbladders a lot of times they do it

230
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,960
without

231
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,240
having to some people have mystery pain

232
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,400
nobody knows what it is

233
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,440
it's a mystery pain and they pluck those

234
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,400
gallbladders out

235
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,360
just for the sake just for just for the

236
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,039
sake of it

237
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,759
they just pluck them out pluck them like

238
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:11,280
apples off a tree pluck put put

239
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,680
pluck pull pluck gall bladders goblins

240
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,120
gallbladders right

241
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,520
kidney stones are really common

242
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,800
everybody's got kidney stones it depends

243
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:22,720
on what's happening

244
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:26,960
so we'll cover that a little bit so

245
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:29,919
right inside your kidney you guys

246
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:32,320
inside your kidneys all that butter all

247
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:34,479
that butter ends up in the kidney

248
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,159
all that all those eggs end up in the

249
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:37,360
kidney all that cheese ends up in the

250
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:40,240
kidneys

251
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,599
sits in there on the shelf sits right

252
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,360
there on the shelf

253
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,959
you get the protein stones and the

254
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,880
calcium stones sometimes you get a

255
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,519
combination of both protein and calcium

256
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,880
stones

257
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:52,880
everybody's got it you may not know

258
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,080
olympic athletes have it they have

259
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,440
kidney stones

260
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,279
i mean i can't tell you how many olympic

261
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,800
athletes that come to me for help for

262
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,160
different stuff with their health as as

263
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,440
they're getting a little older

264
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,360
and next to you know they've got kidney

265
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,600
stones how's that possible

266
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,600
it's possible because if you're not

267
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,360
you've still if you're not eating good

268
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,360
you're eating really acidic you could be

269
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,120
really really really acidic and still

270
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,160
have lots of muscle and still be able to

271
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:18,160
perform but be really really acidic

272
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,360
but stuff all breaks down later on and

273
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,440
breaks down all

274
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,120
later on and breaks down inside those

275
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,839
kidneys right on the shelf right there

276
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,560
and these little

277
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:29,519
these little nooks and crannies in here

278
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:33,600
you get all these little tiny crystals

279
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:36,240
calcium crystals protein crystals

280
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,800
and i'll go into like why we get the

281
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,560
protein versus calcium so let's do that

282
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,560

00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,800
i'm trying to juggle

316
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,560
literally juggle a whole bunch of stuff

317
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,440
right here spirit of compassion is

318
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,360
talking to me

319
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:50,399
i'm reading comments we're talking about

320
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:52,560
the juicer let's do this

321
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,560
so

322
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,720
we leach calcium is what we do we leach

323
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,160
it from

324
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:02,959
our bones that's how we do it okay we

325
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:06,959
lose our calcium as time goes on

326
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:06,959
right and

327
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:14,640
we all end up there we all end up there

328
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:16,320
and all our calcium ends up in our

329
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:19,360
kidneys and we

330
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:21,120
pee it out all the time we pee our

331
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:24,240
calcium out

332
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,200
every single day we pee it out that's

333
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,200
what we do

334
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,519
we peel a little bit more of our calcium

335
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,680
out every day even if you don't have a

336
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,200
big calcium stone in your kidney

337
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,680
you've got all these little calcium

338
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,839
crystals in your kidney your kidneys

339
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,120
build up all these tiny little calcium

340
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,600
crystals and we

341
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,519
we pee out those crystals every single

342
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,959
day we pee out those crystals

343
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:50,560
that's what we do so our frame

344
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:54,399
starts to slowly disintegrate as

345
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:57,680
every year and decade goes by a frame

346
00:11:54,399 --> 00:12:01,200
slowly disintegrates our skull

347
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:03,040
starts to dissolve inside out inside

348
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:06,079
out that's where it starts to dissolve

349
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:09,839
okay that's where it dissolves

350
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:13,360
from the inside out it gets thin

351
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:14,639
and then you're 60 years old 55 years

352
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:18,079
old

353
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:20,160
sometimes 45 sometimes whatever

354
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:22,000
and you and you're walking along and you

355
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,440
slip and you bend your head

356
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,079
and you fractured your skull because

357
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,240
things are getting thinner

358
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,839
julie says you said in cleanse to heal

359
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,360
there's toxic calcium

360
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,440
is this what you are referring to leach

361
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,120
bone calcium the toxic calcium is from

362
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,600
dairy products

363
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,240
so that's the toxic calcium that's one

364
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,000
of them

365
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,760
the other toxic calcium comes out of

366
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,279
chemtrails floating out of the sky

367
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,399
man we are and you know comes floating

368
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:50,079
out the sky

369
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:51,760
it comes okay toxic calcium is also on

370
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:54,320
water supplies right

371
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,680
but toxic calcium is also in the dairy

372
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,839
products that's the calcium that's the

373
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,560
toxic calcium too and toxic calcium

374
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,120
causes

375
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,839
the leaching of our our you know good

376
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,000
calcium

377
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:05,519
that causes it as well because you know

378
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,519
and so

379
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,760
problem is we walk around so acidic and

380
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,760
then we're doing the caffeine you guys

381
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,680
and we're doing the vinegars we're doing

382
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,160
the caffeine we're doing the vinegars

383
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,760
and we're

384
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:19,519
leaching calcium left and right

385
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,800
and that calcium crystals build up in

386
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,160
the kidneys

387
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,920
and the reason why we leach it is we

388
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,519
have to buffer the acids we have to

389
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,120
buffer the acids

390
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,880
that's how our body works to protect

391
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,040
your organ brain your brain

392
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,079
and your heart to buffer the acid guys

393
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,040
just came on

so really important to know

399
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,760
how protein works okay

400
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:56,399
protein doesn't break down in

401
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:58,320
everybody's guts anymore we don't break

402
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,920
our protein down we think we break our

403
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,199
protein down but we don't

404
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:05,040
because our hcl doesn't allow it we

405
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:07,199
don't have strong hcl anymore

406
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,519
everybody's losing their hcl

407
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:10,639
they're losing our hydrochloric acid

408
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:13,120
it's important to know

409
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,120
right here

410
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:19,199
okay our stomach

411
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,680
our stomach tends to wear out people's

412
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,199

413
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,199

disclaimer 4-1-1 to the animal protein

437
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:21,040
people

438
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,880
okay i support animal protein diets and

439
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,800
i support plant-based diets

440
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,399
i'll rip apart the plant-based diet in

441
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,199
10 seconds flat

442
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,399
10 seconds flat i'm not biased and i'm

443
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:33,360
not sure this isn't an

444
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:36,320
anti-animal protein campaign but you

445
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:38,800
want to keep on doing too much chicken

446
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,320
too much chicken you're gonna burn out

447
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:45,360
those stomach glands

448
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:45,360
burn them out lila says

449
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,040
sylvia phil spinach is among those green

450
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,560
veggies

451
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,120
that contain the highest amount of

452
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:55,199
oxalic acid wrong

453
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,120
eating too much spinach may result in

454
00:15:55,199 --> 00:16:01,040
the formation of calcium oxalate

455
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:02,480
oxalate wrong which can cause kidney

456
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,880
stones not true that's called

457
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,399
misinformation and that's what's sad

458
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,240
because you're going to carry that mr

459
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:11,360
information around

460
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,240
and that's really really sad no one has

461
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:16,320
ever eaten

462
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:17,920
enough spinach to prove that point okay

463
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,440
you know somebody that's gobbling down

464
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,639

00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,559
understand there's misinformation out

537
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,919
there and and to the credit of the

538
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:29,600
person

539
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:32,240
you know to the credit of the person

540
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:35,280
that says you know that spinach causes

541
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:37,280
uh you know an oxalic acid stone or

542
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,919
you know actually causes you know a

543
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:42,080
stone a stone in the kidney

544
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:43,760
it's misinformation and i don't blame

545
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,600
you for having misinformation it's just

546
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,360
that information hurts people

547
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,960
it'll make someone who doesn't even eat

548
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:51,679
spinach anyway

549
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,520
it'll make them never eat a spinach leaf

550
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:55,919
if they even had a spinach leaf

551
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:58,160
two years ago in some weird mixed green

552
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:59,919
salad over a friend's house

553
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,919
the point is no one's eating spinach

554
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:02,320
spinach has never given anybody a kidney

555
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,880
stone

556
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,960
ever spinach is an incredible food you

557
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,600
should juice it if you get the mm-900

558
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,960
juice it

559
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:11,120
juice it with a whole bunch of different

560
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,960
stuff it's an incredible food

561

spinach none

576
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,640

meanwhile you will get a kidney stone

582
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,600
and it won't because of a piece of

583
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,280
spinach and because your caffeine your

584
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,600
vinegar

585
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:59,520
your kidney stones are caused by

how many anything what about nuts and

749
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,080
seeds just so you don't no one's off the

750
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,159
hook being a vegan

751
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,679
if you're doing it wrong you're eating

752
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:21,200
all those nuts and all those seeds

753
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:23,120
you're doing all those nut butters that

754
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:26,080
guess what that's really acidic

755
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:27,679
and you're gonna get those kidney stones

756
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,600
too many nuts and seeds

757
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:31,279
and all the fats and oils will give you

758
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:33,440
kidney stones and it'll still gunk up

759
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:36,799
your gallbladder you're not off the hook

760
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:38,399
as a plant person and i'm pro if you're

761
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:40,000
if you're on a plant-based diet stay on

762
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:40,799
a plant-based diet if you're on a

763
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,440
plant-based diet

764
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:44,799
stay on a plant-based diet if you're on

765
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,120
an animal protein diet that's what you

766
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:48,960
want to do stay on it

767
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,480
don't switch sides you don't have to

768
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,919
switch sides you have to run back and

769
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,240
forth

770
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:56,080
but but you need to know how to clean

771
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,480
things up either way because you can be

772
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:03,279
plant-based and dirty everything up and

773
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:06,720
and not heal in fact get sick

774
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:10,000
here's how the plant-based diet works

775
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:12,720
you eat lots of fat plant fat

776
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:15,200
until you get sick and then you get you

777
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:18,480
get run and scared

778
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:20,159
back to your eggs you get run and scared

779
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:24,559
back to your eggs

780
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:27,200
right because you're you're told that

781
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:31,679
you needed eggs like why aren't you why

782
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:35,140
aren't you doing eggs

783
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:37,039
saving money saving money

784
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:39,360
[Applause]

785
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:41,200
love it never had that with a juicer

786
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:44,320
before in my life

787
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:47,520
try them all

788
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:50,799
this is a cold cold pressed juicer

789
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:54,399
right and um

790
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:57,440
no metal gears grinding against

791
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:59,760
each other no metal gears

792
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:02,080
don't know a juicer better it's quiet

793
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:03,820
you can juice without tons of noise

794
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,840
you don't hear

795
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:07,840
[Music]

796
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:09,360
you don't hear all these crazy noises

797
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:13,679
you don't hear that when you're juicing

798
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:15,279
with this

799
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:16,799
the only problem with juicing with this

800
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:18,559
juicer is it's too quiet

801
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:19,840
for me because then i have to hear

802
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:21,440
spirit of compassion

803
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:24,640
when i really don't want to hear spirit

804
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,640
of compassion all the time

805
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:29,440
as you probably know if you read origins

806
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:31,650
of a medical medium in my

807
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:34,729

anthony are you plant-based it's

810
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:46,640
it's a secret it's a secret

811
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:49,840
i might be it might be it might be

812
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,840

814
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,240
the plant

815
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:01,679
what's the juicer's name see omega

816
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,520
juicers.com

817
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:05,720
but that's not the juicer it's the

818
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:09,840
mm-900 hds

819
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:09,840
mm-900 hds

820
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:18,399
okay so what you'll find in the mm

821
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:21,520
900 hds is you'll find dry pulp right

822
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:23,840
dry pulp that's where the money's at

823
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:25,279
the money's in the dried pulp right

824
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:27,200
that's where the money's at it's the

825
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:30,240
dried pulp

826
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,640
it's not the wet slimy pulp that you

827
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,200
lose

828
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,320
all of your juice it's the dried pulp

829
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,840
and that's where it's at

830
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:38,080
and it's important to know how that

831
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:38,799
works it's dusty dry you can dump the

832
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,520
pulp out

833
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:42,640
and this is very very very fibrous

834
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:45,279
celery right here

835
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,080
extremely fibrous right but what you

836
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:49,279
won't find

837
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:51,200
is that wet juice just dry

838
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:52,399
all the little pieces they didn't stick

839
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,080
they're dry right

840
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:56,960
that's that's the difference that's

841
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:59,760
where the money's at right there

842
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,760
that's where it's at

843
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:06,159
gotta strain your juice straining the

844
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:09,360
celery juice is important

845
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:12,159
keep that in mind so straining it's

846
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:13,840
really important

847
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:16,320
a little fell out there because i'm

848
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,320

dropped a little touch of it

852
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:26,720
but can you imagine real wet pulp where

853
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,159
you lose all the juice anyway and then

854
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,120
you spill a little drop and now you're

855
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:31,200
like oh my god

856
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:34,640

that's amazing on how it works quick

873
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:14,000
like that

874
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:16,159
so it's it but we have things stored up

875
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,760
inside our kidneys inside our liver

876
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:19,760
inside our gallbladder

877
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:22,080
we have stuff stored up in our stomach

878
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:24,080
you guys let me show you something

879
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:26,840
let me let me show you something you

880
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:29,919
might find it interesting

881
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:33,679
okay inside your stomach

882
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:36,880
all right inside your stomach

883
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:38,559
there's pockets we have pockets that

884
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,840
build up inside our stomach

885
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:42,000
we got pockets that build up in the

886
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:45,039
basin

887
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,679
the basin where your stomach where your

888
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:48,720
food

889
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:50,159
leaves your stomach and starts heading

890
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:52,640
down your duodenum

891
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:53,760
a pocket builds up with sludge right

892
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:56,320
there

893
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:57,039
a pocket of sludge and then it gets

894
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,360
heavy

895
00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:02,000
and then your stomach stretches around

896
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:04,880
the duodenum entrance

897
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,440
and in a divot forms and you get sludge

898
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,840
that's been

899
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:11,039
in there for 20 years sitting in your

900
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:13,519
stomach that's never left your stomach

901
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:15,760
you need something to do some cleaning

902
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:18,720
and to get in there and clean that out

903
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:20,960
so you can clean that out of the stomach

904
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,960
and clean it out of there and then the

905
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:24,320
other thing is everybody's stomach lands

906
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:27,679
are toasted

907
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:29,679

incredible you know what's funny about

916
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:48,399
that you guys that should be breaking

917
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,320
news

918
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:51,760
that should be breaking news because you

919
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:55,679
guys aren't paid for

920
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:56,480
bots you guys aren't being paid to say

921
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:58,399
that

922
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,000
like with all the paid campaigns on the

923
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:02,640
trends out there they're all

924
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,640
99 were being paid unless or they're in

925
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:07,039
the mlm marketing so

926
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:08,320
right what happens or they did celery

927
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:10,800
juice it healed them and then they're

928
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:13,520
saying some other product did it

929
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:15,359
that they're selling or mlm or something

930
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:17,679
what's incredible is that should be

931
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:19,760
breaking news out there in the world but

932

regular donuts

1079

sue is it common to have lots of

1080
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:36,240
diarrhea after having celery juice

1081
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:39,119
well it's like this so

1082
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:40,480
i want you to be your own detective

1083
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:42,160
never had diarrhea before

1084
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,760
you don't have diarrhea at all you don't

1085
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:46,960
have the runs at all so

1086
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:48,960
it's something that never happened and

1087
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,920
it only happens when you have celery

1088
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:52,160
juice

1089
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,200
then you're having to die off so what i

1090
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:56,640
tell people

1091
00:39:53,200 --> 00:40:00,000
is reduce the amount

1092
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:02,079
that means you're sensitive reduce it

1093
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:05,200
the other thing is is celery juice is

1094
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:07,040
going to flush and clean

1095
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:08,960
it's going to flush and clean and it

1096
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:10,319
goes away over time the runs with celery

1097
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,040
juice if you're one if you're one of

1098
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:12,960
those

1099
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:15,119
that just means you've got a lot going

1100
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:17,920
on so sue it means you've got a lot

1101
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:19,040
a lot of bacteria in there got the

1102
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,560
bacteria

1103
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:22,079
everybody has all the strep and they

1104
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:23,760
have all the the the

1105
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:25,520
they have all the e coli they have all

1106
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:27,920
the staff they have all the c

1107
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:29,760
diff and it's loaded in there the other

1108
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,880
thing is strain your celery juice that's

1109
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,599
another thing too to be your own

1110
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,400
detective

1111
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:35,119
and it's really helpful it eases that

1112
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:38,400
another thing

1113
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:38,960
too is you know if i was having diarrhea

1114
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,400
and it was

1115
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:42,480
with celery juice and i didn't change

1116
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:45,040
anything didn't do anything different

1117
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,839
didn't catch a stomach bug either that's

1118
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:48,319
something to be

1119
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:50,319
to consider too did you catch a stomach

1120
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:52,480
bug did you eat in a restaurant

1121
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:54,720
around the time you started your celery

1122
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:56,960
juice because it's easy to just blame

1123
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:59,760
the new thing you started right

1124
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:01,680
it's easy i've seen people blame

1125
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,160
everything for anything i've seen people

1126
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:05,280
blame

1127
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:07,599
oil pulling for diet for oil pulling

1128
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,960
for diarrhea they started oil pulling

1129
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:09,920
the week they got food poisoning and

1130
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:12,319
they're like oh my god it's

1131
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:13,440
oil pulling i've seen people just blame

1132
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:15,680
anything and everything

1133
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:17,599
so what i'm saying is if if it was me

1134
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:19,680
regardless i would be

1135
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:22,800
lowering the amount that's what i would

1136
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:25,119
do but you do what your doctor tells you

1137
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:26,000
so how many donuts has everybody had how

1138
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:28,160

ashley rose using celery juice and

1140
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:32,160

1141
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,880
lost 80 pounds in a year

1142
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:36,640

1143
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:40,240
lose weight in my life but when i

1144
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:44,160

in every day you guys

1163
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:22,640

1164
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:25,119
to be a gas attendant

1165
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:26,960
at the gas stations and the gas

1166
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:28,400
attendant would pump gas for like 30

1167
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:30,800
years and then die

1168
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:32,560
did you guys know that just die it's

1169
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:36,319
just petrochemical disease

1170
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:38,560
they just died now gas attendants

1171
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:40,720
aren't breathing in gas all day long

1172
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:42,560
right sometimes it only lasts 10 years

1173
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:45,440
as a gas attendant before they die

1174
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,760
15 years 20 years they were like you

1175
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,680
know

1176
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:49,119
that's what to do you you would be a gas

1177
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:52,400

1178
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:54,000
