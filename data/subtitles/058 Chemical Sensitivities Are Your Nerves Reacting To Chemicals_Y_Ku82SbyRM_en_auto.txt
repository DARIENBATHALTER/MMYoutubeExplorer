[251.24 - 256.80] they're crazy and then there's people
[254.08 - 259.48] that don't know their chemical sensitive
[256.80 - 261.48] and they're told they're crazy why are
[259.48 - 264.72] they told they're crazy because of they

[319.92 - 325.88] and the list goes on and people they're
[323.00 - 328.52] told they're crazy at least years ago
[325.88 - 330.60] now it's more accepted now it's like oh
[328.52 - 333.32] you're one of them chemical sensitive
[330.60 - 334.92] person okay and doctors now when they
[333.32 - 337.36] see their patients and their patients
[334.92 - 340.60] come in and their patient says I'm
[337.36 - 343.48] chemical sensitive I react to everything
[340.60 - 346.28] doctors now go oh okay you're one of
[343.48 - 349.32] them I understand I can try to talk you
[346.28 - 352.80] through this instead years ago it's like
[349.32 - 356.08] oh you're one of them there needs to be
[352.80 - 358.16] like millions of apologies issued to all
[356.08 - 359.60] these people that went through hell
[358.16 - 361.68] living hell because they were chem
[359.60 - 364.60] chemical sensitive all these years 10
[361.68 - 367.40] years ago 15 years ago 20 years ago
[364.60 - 370.32] people good-hearted people good-hearted
[367.40 - 374.08] Souls that were suffering from all kinds
[370.32 - 376.92] of strange weird symptoms and they were
[374.08 - 379.32] chemical sensitive and they got treated
[376.92 - 381.96] like crap they got stepped on they got
[379.32 - 382.96] told they were crazy making it up they
[381.96 - 385.00] were
[382.96 - 386.96] hypochondriacs that they had Phantom
[385.00 - 389.04] issues that they were fabricating out of
[386.96 - 390.64] nowhere they were told all these things
[389.04 - 393.12] and they suffered through it and all
[390.64 - 395.24] these apologies should be issued to all
[393.12 - 398.24] of them but it'll never happen it's like
[395.24 - 400.72] it never existed it's not like it's all
[398.24 - 402.60] been fixed like a chemical sensitive
[400.72 - 404.96] person gets put on a pedestal or they
[402.60 - 406.68] actually get treated with respect or
[404.96 - 409.16] someone says oh my God you're chemical
[406.68 - 410.88] sensitive sure let's figure this out
[409.16 - 413.28] let's put you over here let's help you
[410.88 - 415.64] with this let's solve your problems
[413.28 - 418.40] let's talk about it no it's not like
[415.64 - 421.60] that people are still told they're crazy
[418.40 - 424.24] it's better than it ever was that's true
[421.60 - 426.04] it's better than it was many years ago
[424.24 - 428.20] but people still have a hard time with
[426.04 - 431.00] their family the people around them with
[428.20 - 433.04] their friends with their co-workers they
[431.00 - 435.32] still have a very hard time there are
[433.04 - 436.92] people that work in an office they're
[435.32 - 438.88] sitting next to somebody who has all
[436.92 - 440.96] that Fabrics off and are just whoosing
[438.88 - 442.92] off of them and it's giving them a hard
[440.96 - 445.64] time they're getting symptoms they don't
[442.92 - 448.92] feel good but they have to live with it
[445.64 - 451.60] it's better than it was people do
[448.92 - 454.48] understand a a little bit doctors are
[451.60 - 458.08] looking out for people in a better way
[454.48 - 460.76] but it's still hard it's still difficult
[458.08 - 463.68] many situations people do things on
[460.76 - 465.84] spite when somebody's chemical sensitive
[463.68 - 467.12] and they complain a little too much
[465.84 - 469.48] because they're trying to protect
[467.12 - 471.80] themselves let's face it because they
[469.48 - 474.60] need help and they're looking for some
[471.80 - 478.36] kind of relief so they can function and
[474.60 - 480.88] then somebody on spite does something to
[478.36 - 484.20] them purposely to make their situation
[480.88 - 487.52] worse like wearing more cologne or even
[484.20 - 489.76] more perfume on spite someone working
[487.52 - 492.08] with them will say hey can you dial it
[489.76 - 495.60] down I'm really sensitive to your
[492.08 - 498.80] perfume then that person sprays two more
[495.60 - 501.40] sprays of perfume on them purposely when
[498.80 - 504.60] someone's not chemical sensitive they'll
[501.40 - 506.80] never understand they just can't cuz
[504.60 - 508.40] it's not bothering them it's hard to
[506.80 - 510.68] connect with that person who's chemical
[508.40 - 513.28] sensitive because they're smelling
[510.68 - 515.48] things but it's not bugging them at all
[513.28 - 518.32] they're wearing perfumes cologn they got
[515.48 - 520.88] the air fresheners they don't care about
[518.32 - 523.28] gasoline they don't care about exhaust
[520.88 - 525.68] fumes they don't care about smoke in the
[523.28 - 527.92] air they'll sit in front of a fire pit
[525.68 - 530.40] while the fire pit is burning treated
[527.92 - 532.60] wood with chemicals in it so they can't
[530.40 - 534.48] relate it's not possible while that
[532.60 - 536.48] other person who's chemically sensitive
[534.48 - 537.36] that knows they're chemically sensitive
[536.48 - 539.08] though cuz there's two different
[537.36 - 541.24] chemical sensitives out there there's
[539.08 - 543.80] one that don't know and have no idea
[541.24 - 546.44] it's affecting them in any way and ones
[543.80 - 549.04] that do know and the ones that do know
[546.44 - 552.08] know that the fire pits bothering their
[549.04 - 554.08] sinuses making their chest all tight
[552.08 - 555.96] making them not feel good they know the
[554.08 - 558.12] air fresheners are making them sick they
[555.96 - 560.44] know the Colones and perfumes are waking
[558.12 - 563.16] out their nervous systems they know
[560.44 - 565.36] these things and to the other person
[563.16 - 568.08] they sound like they're hypochondriacs
[565.36 - 569.80] and that they're crazy but they're not
[568.08 - 572.00] this doesn't mean the person who can
[569.80 - 574.16] handle all that smoke from treated wood
[572.00 - 575.84] burning or handle all that perfume on
[574.16 - 577.80] their body is
[575.84 - 580.48] indestructible they can just get cancer
[577.80 - 582.68] and die they can have a heart attack
[580.48 - 584.52] tomorrow they can be going along
[582.68 - 586.40] everything's great they smell everything
[584.52 - 588.32] they're happy they got chemicals all on
[586.40 - 589.64] their body they're breathing in
[588.32 - 591.80] pesticides in their yard as they're
[589.64 - 593.72] spraying their flowers They're doing all
[591.80 - 596.00] that they look indestructible they're
[593.72 - 597.56] fine they don't smell anything all is
[596.00 - 600.48] good they're not reacting and then they
[597.56 - 602.48] go drop dead 10 years later and it also
[600.48 - 605.28] doesn't mean that they're never going to
[602.48 - 607.96] become chemical sensitive in their life
[605.28 - 610.60] see that's not true either they could
[607.96 - 612.84] become chemical sensitive down the road
[610.60 - 615.84] in fact they could become chemical
[612.84 - 617.72] sensitive and not even know it so as
[615.84 - 620.84] they got that fabric softener cooking in
[617.72 - 622.72] the dryer and they got that detergent
[620.84 - 624.56] and they got all kinds of chemicals
[622.72 - 625.96] cleaning products that are actually
[624.56 - 627.64] dangerous in their house and they're
[625.96 - 630.44] breathing it all in while they're trying
[627.64 - 632.52] to kill a spider with a can of toxic
[630.44 - 635.76] pesticide while they're doing all of
[632.52 - 638.88] this and breathing in all kinds of crazy
[635.76 - 641.96] stuff they can become chemical sensitive
[638.88 - 644.48] get symptoms from it run to a 100
[641.96 - 646.84] doctors and not realize all those
[644.48 - 649.00] chemicals are pushing their body over
[646.84 - 651.32] the edge now what does chemical
[649.00 - 654.28] sensitive even mean what's really
[651.32 - 657.36] happening why is one person reacting to
[654.28 - 660.16] a chemical or some type of agent or
[657.36 - 662.44] solvent or some kind of toxic stuff
[660.16 - 666.00] that's in the air or on their skin when
[662.44 - 669.08] another person isn't because their scale
[666.00 - 670.92] is tipped someone becomes chemical
[669.08 - 674.04] sensitive because they're being
[670.92 - 677.28] triggered the chemicals whatever form or
[674.04 - 679.16] shape they're in are triggering them
[677.28 - 681.28] they're lowering their immune system
[679.16 - 683.16] which is already lowered they're
[681.28 - 685.56] antagonizing their nervous system which
[683.16 - 688.24] is already inflamed they're
[685.56 - 690.44] overburdening the liver which is already
[688.24 - 692.76] overburdened and the chemicals are
[690.44 - 695.52] acting as a trigger which is feeding
[692.76 - 697.60] pathogens and bugs which were already
[695.52 - 699.76] being fed by other chemicals in the
[697.60 - 703.08] person's body because the scale has been
[699.76 - 706.44] tipped earlier on and the person who
[703.08 - 708.12] isn't chemical sensitive isn't having a
[706.44 - 710.56] situation where their liver is
[708.12 - 712.44] overflowing with toxins they're not
[710.56 - 714.04] quite there yet with all the triggers
[712.44 - 716.64] now they may have some of these things
[714.04 - 718.52] going on a pathogen or two in their body
[716.64 - 721.04] creating all kinds of stuff Underneath
[718.52 - 723.16] It All they may have sensitivities but
[721.04 - 725.80] they're not quite showing themselves yet
[723.16 - 729.16] and they may have inflammation and it's
[725.80 - 731.52] not quite fully there yet but they're on
[729.16 - 734.04] their way they're just not totally
[731.52 - 736.64] spilled over and tipped over like the
[734.04 - 738.52] other person is by medical medium
[736.64 - 740.92] standards information that was released
[738.52 - 743.28] in Liver Rescue and in other places
[740.92 - 745.20] through medical medium information when
[743.28 - 747.64] someone's chemically sensitive their
[745.20 - 749.76] liver is overburdened stagnant and
[747.64 - 751.68] sluggish and overworked
[749.76 - 754.20] this is when the liver becomes a fatty
[751.68 - 756.96] liver even if non-diagnosed not
[754.20 - 759.08] diagnosed as a fatty liver the liver's
[756.96 - 762.36] not functioning good it's stagnant it's
[759.08 - 765.16] sluggish it's not awake it's dense it's
[762.36 - 768.00] overburdened it's hardening up why does
[765.16 - 770.84] this happened because of a lifestyle in
[768.00 - 774.72] combination of pathogens such as viruses
[770.84 - 779.36] like Epstein bar shingles Cirus herplex
[774.72 - 781.80] 1 herplex 2 hhv6 hhv7
[779.36 - 785.28] viruses inside the liver trapped in
[781.80 - 787.88] there living in there working on tissue
[785.28 - 790.04] making it more dense making it more
[787.88 - 792.68] problematic and weakening the immune
[790.04 - 795.84] system inside the liver along with
[792.68 - 798.32] toxins poisons like fragrances other
[795.84 - 801.76] toxins and poisons and heavy metals
[798.32 - 805.72] Mercury aluminum copper cadmium lead
[801.76 - 808.24] arsenic nickel and even toxic calcium
[805.72 - 811.04] along with a thousand other chemicals
[808.24 - 813.64] that found their way into the filter
[811.04 - 816.64] your filter the liver it's there
[813.64 - 819.04] filtering your blood filtering what's
[816.64 - 822.76] going into your intestinal tract and up
[819.04 - 826.48] the stream of blood into the liver and
[822.76 - 828.88] that filter your liver can have 10,000
[826.48 - 831.48] chemicals that are foreign to the human
[828.88 - 833.36] body 10,000 chemicals from chemical
[831.48 - 835.56] companies from the chemical industry
[833.36 - 838.24] just sitting inside the liver and when
[835.56 - 840.76] your liver gets tired stagnant and
[838.24 - 844.20] sluggish and it's not working as good as
[840.76 - 846.56] it should then something goes wrong then
[844.20 - 849.76] conversion doesn't happen like it needs
[846.56 - 852.12] to the conversion of nutrients
[849.76 - 854.60] methylation becomes stagnant and
[852.12 - 857.04] sluggish when nutrients enter your body
[854.60 - 858.84] from Foods they get to the liver and
[857.04 - 862.00] they're supposed to be blessed by the
[858.84 - 864.76] liver converted and they can't so
[862.00 - 867.12] methylation starts to go downhill and
[864.76 - 869.44] the person starts to become nutrient
[867.12 - 871.36] deficient while this is happening though
[869.44 - 873.36] a lot of different symptoms can occur
[871.36 - 876.80] and a lot of different conditions can
[873.36 - 880.00] happen like pre-diabetes type 2
[876.80 - 881.76] diabetes blood sugar inconsistencies
[880.00 - 883.80] hypoglycemia
[881.76 - 886.68] hypoglycemia and then cholesterol
[883.80 - 889.60] problems as well but when the liver is
[886.68 - 892.36] stagnant sluggish tired overburdened and
[889.60 - 894.16] overworked something else can happen
[892.36 - 897.52] especially if the liver is filled with
[894.16 - 900.04] pathogens and toxins and toxic heavy
[897.52 - 904.52] metals when it's f filled with all of
[900.04 - 907.80] those something not great occurs a
[904.52 - 910.44] spillover the liver can't hold on to all
[907.80 - 913.00] the garbage dump stuff anymore it has to
[910.44 - 916.12] release some it has to let go and when
[913.00 - 919.52] it lets go it's a spill and what does
[916.12 - 922.12] that spill contain pathogens release out
[919.52 - 923.96] of their viral cells and bacterial cells
[922.12 - 926.36] lots of different neurotoxins and
[923.96 - 927.96] poisons and garbage and junk and then
[926.36 - 930.80] toxic heavy metals that are sitting in
[927.96 - 934.08] the liver for a life time start to
[930.80 - 937.24] oxidize start to gas out start to pocket
[934.08 - 939.84] out and that debris starts to spread and
[937.24 - 941.84] leave the liver too and then depending
[939.84 - 944.32] on the pathogens that are sitting inside
[941.84 - 947.48] the liver some of those pathogens like
[944.32 - 950.20] Epstein bar will feed off of copper feed
[947.48 - 952.68] off of aluminum and mercury and release
[950.20 - 955.24] all kinds of toxic heavy metal
[952.68 - 958.08] neurotoxins out of the viral cells and
[955.24 - 960.24] into the bloodstream and then the liver
[958.08 - 962.92] can't filter like it's supposed to
[960.24 - 965.76] anymore it's not being a good filter
[962.92 - 968.48] it's trying to be a good filter but it's
[965.76 - 971.60] overflowing there's a spill and that
[968.48 - 974.08] spill can be random at any time it can
[971.60 - 976.36] be when you eat something one day it can
[974.08 - 978.24] be when you wake up one morning it can
[976.36 - 980.32] be in the middle of the day sometime
[978.24 - 982.68] when you're exercising it could be when
[980.32 - 985.84] you're walking but these spills are
[982.68 - 988.16] random they happen at any time and when
[985.84 - 991.12] there's a spill the concoction is
[988.16 - 993.60] different in every single person one
[991.12 - 996.52] person may have more heavy metals one
[993.60 - 998.72] person may have one variety of a heavy
[996.52 - 1001.28] metal more so than other varieties of
[998.72 - 1003.76] heavy metals another person might have
[1001.28 - 1006.76] one virus another person could have a
[1003.76 - 1008.84] 100 viruses another person can have
[1006.76 - 1011.48] solvents and all kinds of different
[1008.84 - 1013.00] pharmaceutical compounds when someone
[1011.48 - 1015.88] else might have a whole bunch of
[1013.00 - 1018.28] recreational drugs inside their liver
[1015.88 - 1021.24] and somebody else may have all kinds of
[1018.28 - 1022.80] different fossil fuels and all kinds of
[1021.24 - 1025.40] other different toxins and
[1022.80 - 1028.32] petrochemicals everybody's blend of
[1025.40 - 1031.20] toxins is different and those toxins
[1028.32 - 1034.60] bother the central nervous system most
[1031.20 - 1038.28] of chemical sensitivity symptoms are
[1034.60 - 1040.56] central nervous system based nerve based
[1038.28 - 1043.00] when somebody's spill is filled with all
[1040.56 - 1044.96] kinds of different toxins from toxic C
[1043.00 - 1047.16] metals and from pathogens and other
[1044.96 - 1050.32] chemicals and they actually leave the
[1047.16 - 1053.28] liver they attack themselves to the
[1050.32 - 1056.36] nerves so most symptoms in the chemical
[1053.28 - 1059.48] sensitivity world are from nervous
[1056.36 - 1062.56] system symptoms nervous systems that are
[1059.48 - 1064.44] inflamed and hypers sensitive and then
[1062.56 - 1066.96] another portion of symptoms in the
[1064.44 - 1070.96] chemical sensitivity World those are
[1066.96 - 1074.04] skin issues and swelling issues this is
[1070.96 - 1077.08] when the spill is a different recipe of
[1074.04 - 1079.36] chemicals and toxins and pathogen debris
[1077.08 - 1082.12] and somebody's skin can react
[1079.36 - 1085.00] hives different kind of red blotches
[1082.12 - 1087.72] different kind of spots itchy bumps all
[1085.00 - 1091.04] kinds of different skin conditions and
[1087.72 - 1092.80] then swelling swelling in the knuckles
[1091.04 - 1095.64] stiffness in the knuckles swelling in
[1092.80 - 1098.48] the hands swelling in the elbows
[1095.64 - 1100.44] lymphatic swelling lymphadema all
[1098.48 - 1103.72] through the body all kinds of different
[1100.44 - 1106.48] water retention all these symptoms can
[1103.72 - 1109.20] really perplex people complicate their
[1106.48 - 1110.68] lives and confuse their doctor their
[1109.20 - 1112.60] practitioners their healthc care
[1110.68 - 1114.20] providers their health coaches their
[1112.60 - 1116.16] therapists their
[1114.20 - 1118.80] psychiatrists all of them can get
[1116.16 - 1120.28] confused by these symptoms and people
[1118.80 - 1122.88] get diagnosed with all kinds of
[1120.28 - 1125.24] different mental conditions because of
[1122.88 - 1127.56] chemical sensitivities people will tell
[1125.24 - 1131.68] them well we think we have OCD right
[1127.56 - 1133.08] here or ADHD or add or we have bipolar
[1131.68 - 1134.92] or some other condition they get
[1133.08 - 1136.96] diagnosed with because they're sitting
[1134.92 - 1138.80] there worried and they have anxiety
[1136.96 - 1140.96] they're worried about the carpet being
[1138.80 - 1143.32] hold from underneath them they're
[1140.96 - 1145.12] worried about going down they're worried
[1143.32 - 1147.48] about can't get in their car they have
[1145.12 - 1149.28] panic attacks anxiety conditions all
[1147.48 - 1151.20] kinds of different symptoms and they're
[1149.28 - 1153.16] nervous and they're living their life
[1151.20 - 1155.36] extra nervous because of it and it's
[1153.16 - 1157.88] like a snowball going down a mountain
[1155.36 - 1159.96] side where it's just going down and
[1157.88 - 1162.20] Gathering all this debris and getting
[1159.96 - 1164.88] larger and larger and larger until it
[1162.20 - 1167.72] finally just spills onto a village it's
[1164.88 - 1170.44] that concerning that difficult and that
[1167.72 - 1172.68] complex one of the biggest fears that
[1170.44 - 1175.80] people who have chemical sensitivities
[1172.68 - 1178.00] have is the dentist chair if a dentist
[1175.80 - 1180.16] wears latex gloves and the hygienist
[1178.00 - 1182.32] wears latex gloves that's a big concern
[1180.16 - 1184.68] for people who are chemical sensitive if
[1182.32 - 1186.56] the dentist is using fluoride or wants
[1184.68 - 1189.04] to offer fluoride treatment that's
[1186.56 - 1191.72] another big concern and then it's the
[1189.04 - 1193.12] numbing agents people who are chemical
[1191.72 - 1196.60] sensitive are concerned about the
[1193.12 - 1199.48] numbing agents lidocaine Novocaine
[1196.60 - 1201.84] carbocaine septian all the different
[1199.48 - 1204.28] numbing agents they're worried including
[1201.84 - 1205.84] the numbing gels so what happens is
[1204.28 - 1207.68] they'll take a Q-tip they'll stick it
[1205.84 - 1210.08] into some numbing gel they'll put it
[1207.68 - 1211.64] around a gum line and that's a big
[1210.08 - 1213.64] concern for people who are chemical
[1211.64 - 1217.68] sensitive another thing is getting
[1213.64 - 1219.20] fillings removed or fillings put in if
[1217.68 - 1221.64] it's old fillings whether they're
[1219.20 - 1223.68] composits of some kind or Mercury
[1221.64 - 1225.60] fillings that are old people who are
[1223.68 - 1227.12] chemical sensitive either react or
[1225.60 - 1229.32] they're really concerned and they're
[1227.12 - 1231.48] telling their dentist this their dentist
[1229.32 - 1234.60] if they know them as a patient their
[1231.48 - 1236.32] dentist is wise to it many dentists are
[1234.60 - 1238.00] worried because it could be like Russian
[1236.32 - 1239.92] Roulette they don't know what's going to
[1238.00 - 1242.48] happen in that moment how the person's
[1239.92 - 1244.64] going to react what's going to happen is
[1242.48 - 1247.48] a symptom going to develop it's very
[1244.64 - 1249.16] hard for the patient and for dentists
[1247.48 - 1252.84] often what happens with chemical
[1249.16 - 1255.24] sensitive people is they're reacting but
[1252.84 - 1257.80] yet they're blaming something that did
[1255.24 - 1259.64] not cause the reaction many times
[1257.80 - 1261.48] somebody could be eating something and
[1259.64 - 1263.64] then they get a reaction but what they
[1261.48 - 1266.16] ate did not cause the reaction they were
[1263.64 - 1268.52] going to have a spill anyway or they had
[1266.16 - 1270.20] a spill an hour before they ate
[1268.52 - 1272.88] something and it took time for that
[1270.20 - 1274.72] spill to create a reaction and it's
[1272.88 - 1277.24] possible that what they were eating was
[1274.72 - 1279.32] only helpful to their problem and not
[1277.24 - 1282.08] hurtful but they wouldn't know that
[1279.32 - 1283.84] because they had a spill long before and
[1282.08 - 1287.08] now they're reacting and they think it
[1283.84 - 1289.40] was that strawberry they ate or they'll
[1287.08 - 1291.00] blame the wrong food mixed in with a
[1289.40 - 1292.52] whole bunch of foods like they'll have a
[1291.00 - 1294.76] piece of chocolate cake that had a
[1292.52 - 1296.76] strawberry on top after they eat the
[1294.76 - 1299.68] chocolate cake they get a reaction half
[1296.76 - 1301.48] hour later or 45 minutes later and then
[1299.68 - 1304.00] they blame the strawberry that was on
[1301.48 - 1306.16] top of the cake I can say a thousand
[1304.00 - 1308.08] examples we can go on and on all day
[1306.16 - 1309.92] about this there's a lot of confusion
[1308.08 - 1312.76] people don't know what creates the
[1309.92 - 1315.60] reactions the problem is Foods aren't
[1312.76 - 1317.88] the only thing that caus reactions in
[1315.60 - 1320.16] fact foods cause the least amount of
[1317.88 - 1322.76] reactions it's other stuff happening
[1320.16 - 1325.40] inside the body it's a liver intoxicated
[1322.76 - 1327.48] with so many chemical compounds so many
[1325.40 - 1329.92] different pathogenic chemicals and
[1327.48 - 1331.44] neurotoxins and all of that is actually
[1329.92 - 1333.92] going through the bloodstream hitting
[1331.44 - 1335.60] other organs and creating problems and
[1333.92 - 1338.32] hitting nerves as well and creating
[1335.60 - 1340.40] nervous system symptoms so in the end
[1338.32 - 1342.44] it's not really the food that's why
[1340.40 - 1344.32] somebody else can eat whatever food they
[1342.44 - 1345.48] want and they don't have any kind of
[1344.32 - 1347.48] chemical
[1345.48 - 1349.52] sensitivities often times when people
[1347.48 - 1351.64] are chemical sensitive they'll blame the
[1349.52 - 1353.48] food no matter what they'll be triggered
[1351.64 - 1355.72] left and right and food will always get
[1353.48 - 1357.72] the blame when in the end it's much
[1355.72 - 1360.12] bigger than food it's much more than
[1357.72 - 1362.84] that in another episode coming up we're
[1360.12 - 1364.52] going to go deep into food sensitivities
[1362.84 - 1366.96] people who are chemical sensitive start
[1364.52 - 1369.80] reacting to everything though they react
[1366.96 - 1372.20] to air they react to water they react to
[1369.80 - 1374.64] food they react to chemicals they react
[1372.20 - 1376.72] to just about everything and the problem
[1374.64 - 1379.40] is with that is if you take a healing
[1376.72 - 1381.44] food like a lemon water where you
[1379.40 - 1383.64] squeeze a half a lemon in a glass of
[1381.44 - 1386.08] water and drink that every morning to
[1383.64 - 1388.76] clean the liver flush the liver flush
[1386.08 - 1390.40] the kidneys of toxins what happens is
[1388.76 - 1392.28] that when someone does that and they're
[1390.40 - 1393.60] chemical sensitive and they're having
[1392.28 - 1395.36] any kind of reactions they're going to
[1393.60 - 1397.72] be like nope I got to stay away from
[1395.36 - 1400.20] lemon water I can't do it I can't go
[1397.72 - 1402.04] near it and then they get in trouble
[1400.20 - 1404.48] what kind of trouble they're stuck in a
[1402.04 - 1407.00] catch 22 they're stuck in a vicious
[1404.48 - 1409.16] cycle where they need something to heal
[1407.00 - 1411.48] but they're afraid of using it because
[1409.16 - 1413.08] they're confused when someone got to the
[1411.48 - 1415.92] point where they're really chemical
[1413.08 - 1417.92] sensitive they got past the point of
[1415.92 - 1421.00] dumbing everything down and numbing
[1417.92 - 1423.56] everything out that means using foods to
[1421.00 - 1425.72] suppress they can't do that anymore
[1423.56 - 1428.36] successfully they can't suppress the
[1425.72 - 1431.72] toxins suppress the poisons and suppress
[1428.36 - 1435.08] the emotions anymore because at any
[1431.72 - 1437.00] random time at any moment a spill out of
[1435.08 - 1439.64] the liver can occur and fill the
[1437.00 - 1441.48] bloodstream at any time that means
[1439.64 - 1443.24] whatever they're suppressing themselves
[1441.48 - 1445.24] with and holding down and bogging down
[1443.24 - 1448.24] emotions whatever they're trying to do
[1445.24 - 1451.28] to use food as comfort it doesn't mean
[1448.24 - 1453.60] it will work it will always be a random
[1451.28 - 1457.08] moment a random time where something
[1453.60 - 1460.36] goes KY where nothing they try works
[1457.08 - 1463.32] anymore now it's just Blind Faith
[1460.36 - 1466.24] chemical sensitive people are right for
[1463.32 - 1469.28] the picking they're lwh hanging fruit
[1466.24 - 1471.28] four people who are selling detox is
[1469.28 - 1473.00] selling the hole you're detoxing too
[1471.28 - 1475.04] much that's why you're having reactions
[1473.00 - 1477.80] you're detoxing too much that's why
[1475.04 - 1480.84] you're sick try this concoction try
[1477.80 - 1483.24] these ensures your Pathways aren't open
[1480.84 - 1485.16] your detox Pathways aren't working which
[1483.24 - 1487.40] is ridiculous because there's no science
[1485.16 - 1489.36] or ability to see if their detox pathway
[1487.40 - 1491.56] is working science still doesn't even
[1489.36 - 1494.48] know what the detox pathway actually
[1491.56 - 1497.56] really is it's all a theory but they'll
[1494.48 - 1500.28] still sell that to you and detox sellers
[1497.56 - 1503.12] will use the default mechanism it's you
[1500.28 - 1506.36] and you're detoxing that's what it is
[1503.12 - 1508.88] but overloaded livers and liver spills
[1506.36 - 1511.20] does not mean you're detoxing you could
[1508.88 - 1513.04] be sick and you're having spills your
[1511.20 - 1515.88] liver is overloaded stagnant and
[1513.04 - 1517.92] sluggish and stuff is coming out of the
[1515.88 - 1521.04] liver it's filling your bloodstream but
[1517.92 - 1523.32] that still doesn't mean you are detoxing
[1521.04 - 1525.76] because all of that spill all of those
[1523.32 - 1528.32] toxins is still going back into the
[1525.76 - 1530.12] liver it's not leaving the body because
[1528.32 - 1532.20] because whoever is offering the detox or
[1530.12 - 1534.84] the program or whatever they're selling
[1532.20 - 1536.84] is not properly getting the metals and
[1534.84 - 1539.40] the poisons and the toxins and the
[1536.84 - 1541.72] pathogens out of the body so what's
[1539.40 - 1543.88] happening instead of it leaving the body
[1541.72 - 1546.08] it's circulating and going right back
[1543.88 - 1548.16] into the liver and making the person
[1546.08 - 1551.44] sick and then they're telling the person
[1548.16 - 1553.76] you're detoxing and our thing is working
[1551.44 - 1556.68] proper detoxing is when it leaves the
[1553.76 - 1558.96] liver and then leaves the body because
