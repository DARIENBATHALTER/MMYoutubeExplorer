[232.88 - 236.48] little bit so
[234.48 - 238.32] let's talk about
[236.48 - 240.88] why we're even doing this
[238.32 - 243.44] why even bother why are we doing this
[240.88 - 245.12] why are we doing the anti-blood cleanse
[243.44 - 246.88] what's the point
[245.12 - 248.48] and what are we cleansing
[246.88 - 249.92] what are we even doing
[248.48 - 252.00] here's the first thing we're doing is
[249.92 - 253.44] we're getting rid
[252.00 - 254.64] of bug
[253.44 - 256.56] fuel
[254.64 - 259.36] you know how your car takes fuel your
[256.56 - 260.96] car needs fuel so you can drive maybe
[259.36 - 263.04] you got an electric car
[260.96 - 264.72] and your car still needs fuel because
[263.04 - 266.88] that battery's going to go dead so you
[264.72 - 268.56] got to charge the battery
[266.88 - 270.24] whether you have to charge the battery
[268.56 - 273.12] you've got to put gasoline or you've got
[270.24 - 275.36] to put diesel in a truck whatever it is
[273.12 - 277.12] it needs fuel
[275.36 - 280.48] and that's important to know right it
[277.12 - 284.40] needs fuel well bugs need fuel
[280.48 - 286.08] the bugs that make you sick
[284.40 - 289.20] need fuel
[286.08 - 291.60] everybody's loaded with bad
[289.20 - 293.20] bugs and if you think it's a parasite
[291.60 - 295.12] for some reason you've been brainwashed
[293.20 - 297.44] in in a sense of the parasite world
[295.12 - 299.20] right from the old parasite cleanse
[297.44 - 301.20] thing and parasite knowledge thing then
[299.20 - 303.84] fine think it's a parasite
[301.20 - 306.00] then let's starve the parasite okay but
[303.84 - 309.76] what's really happening is people have
[306.00 - 313.12] bacteria they have lots of viruses
[309.76 - 314.72] lots of viruses inside of them
[313.12 - 316.08] and if you're somebody just came on here
[314.72 - 317.68] and you're like what do you mean viruses
[316.08 - 320.96] like what viruses what are you talking
[317.68 - 323.92] about right fever blisters cold sores
[320.96 - 325.20] viruses simplex herpes too right simply
[323.92 - 329.60] right
[325.20 - 330.64] boom viruses okay h pylori bacteria
[329.60 - 333.60] right
[330.64 - 338.08] and then you know of shingles virus
[333.60 - 340.80] and e coli bacteria staph bacteria right
[338.08 - 342.80] and we have all these bugs inside of us
[340.80 - 344.48] we just do and they sit inside of a
[342.80 - 346.56] strep throat maybe had strep throat at
[344.48 - 347.92] one time maybe had mono at one time
[346.56 - 349.84] here's the thing
[347.92 - 353.04] and medical medium information brought
[349.84 - 356.80] this to the world right if you had mono
[353.04 - 358.16] so if you had mono at some time in your
[356.80 - 359.92] life
[358.16 - 361.12] you may not even know you had it and you
[359.92 - 363.92] had it
[361.12 - 365.60] that bug is the epstein bar and it comes
[363.92 - 368.48] back later
[365.60 - 370.00] it comes back later with fibromyalgia it
[368.48 - 371.84] comes back later with chronic fatigue
[370.00 - 373.36] syndrome hashimoto's thyroiditis
[371.84 - 375.60] hyperthyroidism
[373.36 - 378.64] nodule cysts tumors on the thyroid
[375.60 - 380.40] that's epstein-barr rheumatoid arthritis
[378.64 - 384.64] lyme disease all these things
[380.40 - 386.32] neurological lyme are viral caused right
[384.64 - 387.92] so it's important to know so why are we
[386.32 - 390.72] doing this
[387.92 - 393.36] we're doing this because your eczema is
[390.72 - 397.92] viral cause your psoriasis is viral
[393.36 - 402.24] caused okay your your skin conditions
[397.92 - 404.72] viral caused vitiligo is viral caused
[402.24 - 406.80] your fibrosis your lupus your multiple
[404.72 - 408.56] sclerosis your als there's a lot of
[406.80 - 410.40] stuff and metals play a role too i've
[408.56 - 412.80] talked all about that for years you guys
[410.40 - 415.12] know that but viruses play this huge
[412.80 - 417.04] role including anxiety upping the game
[415.12 - 420.80] with crippling anxiety
[417.04 - 422.40] so it's metals and viruses but viruses
[420.80 - 424.72] need to eat
[422.40 - 426.16] and bugs need to eat if you had chronic
[424.72 - 428.32] sinusitis
[426.16 - 431.44] if you got sinus sensitivities if you
[428.32 - 434.32] had sinus surgeries that's streptococcus
[431.44 - 435.92] that strep needs to eat so it'll sit
[434.32 - 437.92] inside of you and percolate if you get
[435.92 - 439.76] bronchitis if you get chronic coughs if
[437.92 - 442.72] you've got mucus in your lungs that's
[439.76 - 445.60] that chronic strep you have the strep
[442.72 - 448.24] throat chronic strep bacterial vaginosis
[445.60 - 452.80] utis bladder infections kidney
[448.24 - 454.80] infections right sty's conjunctivitis
[452.80 - 456.08] that's streptococcus
[454.80 - 458.48] acne
[456.08 - 460.16] any of you guys deal with acne on and
[458.48 - 463.04] off throughout your life
[460.16 - 466.40] that's streptococcus that's strep that's
[463.04 - 469.04] the original strap from childhood that's
[466.40 - 471.12] the original strap that you you you had
[469.04 - 474.08] when you were younger okay and you got
[471.12 - 476.64] the acne from that strap and maybe you
[474.08 - 478.40] have more than one variety of strap so
[476.64 - 480.08] we're doing the anti-bunk cleanse right
[478.40 - 481.76] there i got the book we'll talk about
[480.08 - 483.04] the different levels
[481.76 - 484.80] so
[483.04 - 486.88] it's important
[484.80 - 489.04] to know
[486.88 - 490.84] that these bugs sit inside of us
[489.04 - 494.08] diverticulosis
[490.84 - 497.20] diverticulitis we got some bugs it's e
[494.08 - 499.84] coli and strep eating away at pockets

[503.44 - 508.48] that the acid reflux so we have to
[505.84 - 511.20] realize that all your problems

[649.28 - 652.56] but the goal
[650.88 - 654.24] is to starve
[652.56 - 657.04] the bugs
[654.24 - 659.28] they go hungry
[657.04 - 660.80] once they go hungry
[659.28 - 662.88] they start
[660.80 - 666.40] to implode
[662.88 - 670.32] that's how bugs work they need fuel all
[666.40 - 674.24] the time what are you feeding your bugs

[739.52 - 743.20] we're in a different place in a
[741.04 - 745.84] different time frame in history we're in
[743.20 - 747.76] a different world
[745.84 - 750.96] you don't want to keep on feeding your
[747.76 - 753.28] bugs you want to learn how to stop
[750.96 - 755.52] feeding your bugs
[753.28 - 756.56] that's what you want to do
[755.52 - 759.92] okay
[756.56 - 761.52] lactose free dairy still feeds the bugs
[759.92 - 765.04] keep that in mind you guys a little note
[761.52 - 768.16] right there lactose free dairy still
[765.04 - 770.88] feeds the bugs the protein
[768.16 - 772.80] in lactose free dairy
[770.88 - 774.56] feeds the bugs
[772.80 - 777.52] keep that in mind right there really
[774.56 - 779.04] important to know so dairy protein will
[777.52 - 780.00] feed the bugs
[779.04 - 781.44] so
[780.00 - 783.76] the goal is
[781.44 - 785.84] to starve out and kill off the bugs
[783.76 - 788.00] what level are you doing to do that if
[785.84 - 789.84] you do level one that's okay you get rid
[788.00 - 791.52] of eggs you get rid of dairy products
[789.84 - 793.28] you get rid of gluten
[791.52 - 795.60] get rid of soft drinks too you know why
[793.28 - 799.28] a lot of soft drinks will have that corn
[795.60 - 800.72] syrup that gmo corn syrup which is a bug
[799.28 - 802.96] fuel
[800.72 - 805.28] all right that's a grain that feeds the
[802.96 - 806.48] bugs okay
[805.28 - 809.68] and
[806.48 - 810.72] you can do level one you can do that
[809.68 - 812.32] right
[810.72 - 815.76] and that's fine
[812.32 - 816.64] level two is another level now keep in
[815.76 - 819.92] mind
[816.64 - 821.52] you take food away from the bugs
[819.92 - 823.20] they go hungry
[821.52 - 824.32] and they're gonna make
[823.20 - 825.28] you
[824.32 - 826.88] very
[825.28 - 830.64] very
[826.88 - 833.04] emotionally hungry for that food so bugs
[830.64 - 833.92] control
[833.04 - 835.28] our
[833.92 - 838.08] habits
[835.28 - 841.20] our habits once you start destroying
[838.08 - 842.48] those bugs keep this in mind you guys
[841.20 - 844.80] once you start
[842.48 - 846.32] it gets hard it gets hard it's all of a
[844.80 - 849.76] sudden once you start killing off those
[846.32 - 852.72] bugs it gets hard it's like
[849.76 - 854.96] i'm gonna make a dozen egg omelet now
[852.72 - 858.64] because once i start killing off those
[854.96 - 860.56] bugs and they start dying in me okay and
[858.64 - 862.08] once those bugs start dying
[860.56 - 863.20] right you see that in telegram you guys
[862.08 - 866.40] tick tock
[863.20 - 867.92] to rumble once those bugs start dying

[867.92 - 871.84] omelet

[871.84 - 875.92] and you're going to want to cook that
[873.28 - 876.96] those babies in butter on a nice skillet
[875.92 - 878.72] because
[876.96 - 880.40] the bugs are going to talk for you
[878.72 - 882.00] they're going to talk for you is what
[880.40 - 883.44] they're going to do they're going to say

[950.32 - 954.80] and decided not to eat all day
[953.36 - 956.16] we're in the wrong i think you're in the
[954.80 - 958.72] wrong room

[982.24 - 985.04] bugs that's why it's the anti-blood
[983.76 - 987.04] cleanse
[985.04 - 990.16] that's why

[1004.40 - 1007.84] they're not crawling out of the eyes
[1006.16 - 1011.60] that's not how they do it
[1007.84 - 1012.64] the dead bug aparts can come out in just
[1011.60 - 1014.48] tears

[1032.00 - 1035.52] so
[1032.88 - 1036.56] that's how the bugs come out so it's
[1035.52 - 1038.72] interesting
[1036.56 - 1040.40] and one of the ways the bugs come out i
[1038.72 - 1042.88] want to give you a better you know what
[1040.40 - 1046.08] you guys let me give you a better
[1042.88 - 1048.40] description of how it comes out okay
[1046.08 - 1050.40] your liver is filled with bugs i'm going
[1048.40 - 1053.28] to bring the bring it over here a little
[1050.40 - 1054.56] bit all right can i move these cucumbers
[1053.28 - 1056.72] over and
[1054.56 - 1058.08] you guys don't mind right move things
[1056.72 - 1059.76] over
[1058.08 - 1061.76] and
[1059.76 - 1064.00] all right
[1061.76 - 1064.00] so
[1064.08 - 1069.28] our livers is where a lot of the bugs
[1067.04 - 1071.20] are happening so that's the party town
[1069.28 - 1074.24] that's where it's happening that's party
[1071.20 - 1076.00] zone right here party central four bugs
[1074.24 - 1077.52] it's in the liver
[1076.00 - 1080.48] different varieties of epstein-barr
[1077.52 - 1083.20] streptococcus inside the liver hhv-6
[1080.48 - 1085.44] hhv7 you guys you wouldn't believe how
[1083.20 - 1087.28] many bugs people have they'll have hhv-6
[1085.44 - 1088.56] hhv-7 they'll have two varieties of
[1087.28 - 1090.08] epsom bar they'll have a shingles
[1088.56 - 1092.32] they'll have a cytomegalovirus all
[1090.08 - 1094.08] sitting inside their liver waiting to
[1092.32 - 1095.92] give you health throughout your whole
[1094.08 - 1098.88] life
[1095.92 - 1101.44] and so it's in here a lot of these bugs
[1098.88 - 1103.84] so here's what's happening all that food
[1101.44 - 1107.52] you eat so if you eat an egg just let's
[1103.84 - 1110.40] use an egg as an example right
[1107.52 - 1112.32] if you're eating an egg
[1110.40 - 1113.44] the egg goes down into your intestinal
[1112.32 - 1117.20] tract
[1113.44 - 1120.48] particles from that egg
[1117.20 - 1123.28] micro particles from that egg get sucked
[1120.48 - 1126.16] up through the hepatic portal vein into
[1123.28 - 1129.44] your liver the hepatic portal vein is
[1126.16 - 1131.44] attached to the intestinal tract
[1129.44 - 1135.20] you guys there's a vein that goes from
[1131.44 - 1138.00] the intestinal tract to the liver a vein
[1135.20 - 1140.48] okay and what happens is those egg
[1138.00 - 1142.32] particles get sucked up the vein and go
[1140.48 - 1144.96] right up into the liver
[1142.32 - 1146.80] and then the bugs feed off of the eggs
[1144.96 - 1148.40] inside your liver so when you're having
[1146.80 - 1149.92] your eggs
[1148.40 - 1152.16] you're just filling your liver up with
[1149.92 - 1154.16] egg particles and feeding the bugs
[1152.16 - 1155.12] happy happy are they
[1154.16 - 1157.76] right
[1155.12 - 1160.08] here's what happens you start to starve
[1157.76 - 1162.96] them you don't feed them with their used
[1160.08 - 1164.64] to be what they're used to eating
[1162.96 - 1167.04] the weak ones
[1164.64 - 1169.52] die first
[1167.04 - 1172.24] so the weak epstein bar
[1169.52 - 1173.60] the weak streptococcus the weak sediment
[1172.24 - 1177.04] virus
[1173.60 - 1178.56] the weak hpv
[1177.04 - 1181.52] the weak
[1178.56 - 1185.76] hiv
[1181.52 - 1187.44] these bugs start to die first and then
[1185.76 - 1191.20] they shoot up
[1187.44 - 1192.56] the bile duct out of the liver into
[1191.20 - 1195.20] the gallbladder
[1192.56 - 1199.20] and back into the intestinal tract and
[1195.20 - 1199.20] then you poop them out
[1200.96 - 1204.80] you don't hear that at the doctor's
[1202.64 - 1206.40] office do you
[1204.80 - 1208.40] you don't hear that at the alternative
[1206.40 - 1209.76] people's offices you don't hear that in
[1208.40 - 1212.56] anybody's books you don't hear that
[1209.76 - 1214.64] anywhere it's all mm info it's why
[1212.56 - 1216.80] people heal
[1214.64 - 1216.80] so
[1217.20 - 1220.56] the bugs aren't coming out through your
[1219.36 - 1222.80] sweat
[1220.56 - 1225.20] keep that in mind
[1222.80 - 1227.52] they come out through other passageways
[1225.20 - 1228.96] they have to be direct like your
[1227.52 - 1232.24] nostrils
[1228.96 - 1234.88] they come out through your eyes
[1232.24 - 1236.56] they can come out sometimes
[1234.88 - 1239.12] through the ears
[1236.56 - 1241.04] but they mostly come out
[1239.12 - 1243.04] through the intestinal tract and your
[1241.04 - 1244.80] kidneys letting you know
[1243.04 - 1246.24] we're inside bug cleanse we're day one

[1246.24 - 1249.60] recommend watching this from the
[1247.60 - 1250.88] beginning everything is vital pertinent
[1249.60 - 1252.00] and important the information is
[1250.88 - 1253.76] critical
[1252.00 - 1255.12] i'm get just let me give you a small
[1253.76 - 1258.24] announcement right here i'm going to be
[1255.12 - 1261.84] on rumble exclusively at 6 15 eastern
[1258.24 - 1265.20] time 3 15 pacific time it's going to be
[1261.84 - 1267.28] a private talk on rumble exclusive there
[1265.20 - 1268.24] make sure you're there okay another
[1267.28 - 1269.68] thing to
[1268.24 - 1271.28] make sure you have the book through
[1269.68 - 1274.24] these cleanses or if you don't have it
[1271.28 - 1278.56] now get one critical okay
[1274.24 - 1280.56] 16.99 amazon.com us it's on sale i call
[1278.56 - 1282.32] it divine intervention angelic
[1280.56 - 1284.48] intervention because they priced the
[1282.32 - 1286.32] book for some reason
[1284.48 - 1288.16] and you know what it's possibly priced
[1286.32 - 1289.76] at this low to actually try to hurt me
[1288.16 - 1291.28] or something right because there's so
[1289.76 - 1293.12] much discrimination against medical
[1291.28 - 1295.28] meaning for a lot of reasons because
[1293.12 - 1297.04] being the number one health author in
[1295.28 - 1298.72] the world for almost seven years running
[1297.04 - 1300.72] has gotten so many people mad it's
[1298.72 - 1302.48] ridiculous right because because people
[1300.72 - 1304.48] heal that's why
[1302.48 - 1306.24] and and that's why the books have been
[1304.48 - 1308.72] out there because so many people healed
[1306.24 - 1310.88] but they lowered the price
[1308.72 - 1312.16] on this book i call it like divine
[1310.88 - 1312.96] intervention
[1312.16 - 1314.80] um
[1312.96 - 1316.56] probably thinking they'll just hurt my
[1314.80 - 1318.56] pocket or something like hey he won't
[1316.56 - 1320.56] get his 10 cents we're gonna make sure
[1318.56 - 1321.68] that we under price it so he doesn't
[1320.56 - 1323.84] live
[1321.68 - 1325.12] and can't pay the light bill but the
[1323.84 - 1326.64] point is
[1325.12 - 1328.48] is what's incredible about it because it
[1326.64 - 1331.12] costs way more to print what's
[1328.48 - 1333.68] incredible about them doing that right
[1331.12 - 1335.84] on amazon.com us is you can get this
[1333.68 - 1339.84] medical textbook for nothing practically
[1335.84 - 1342.24] so it's 16.99 get it now if you can or

[1726.88 - 1731.52] you're like you guys you're many of you
[1729.20 - 1733.60] are brainwashed and when you come here
[1731.52 - 1735.92] you're going to come here so brainwashed
[1733.60 - 1737.44] i saw a comment earlier today on youtube
[1735.92 - 1741.12] and it was something like
[1737.44 - 1743.44] you don't know anything about fats
[1741.12 - 1746.08] aw you know nothing about fats it's
[1743.44 - 1748.24] omega-6s that are the bad ones and you
[1746.08 - 1750.80] know omega-3s are critical
[1748.24 - 1752.24] fats high-fat diets are amazing for us
[1750.80 - 1753.20] you don't know anything about healthy
[1752.24 - 1754.96] fats
[1753.20 - 1757.44] you just don't get it
[1754.96 - 1759.52] and you know when i read that i was like
[1757.44 - 1761.60] okay first of all you don't get it
[1759.52 - 1763.60] because that's vegan doctor information
[1761.60 - 1767.44] that's outdated and antiquated
[1763.60 - 1769.68] okay because yeah sure okay omega-6s
[1767.44 - 1770.64] aren't the best fat but when it comes
[1769.68 - 1771.92] down to
[1770.64 - 1772.88] making
[1771.92 - 1775.36] like
[1772.88 - 1777.84] the break of health in a sense of making
[1775.36 - 1779.60] that break in your life like getting to
[1777.84 - 1781.44] that finish line crossing that finish
[1779.60 - 1784.40] line like getting better from severe
[1781.44 - 1785.36] chronic illness any fat will take you
[1784.40 - 1787.44] down
[1785.36 - 1789.68] and what people don't realize
[1787.44 - 1792.48] is that the fats
[1789.68 - 1794.40] stop your nerves your nerve cells from
[1792.48 - 1795.92] receiving nutrients
[1794.40 - 1798.32] that they need
[1795.92 - 1800.88] including glucose so you can recover
[1798.32 - 1803.68] from multiple sclerosis als chronic
[1800.88 - 1806.16] fatigue syndrome fibromyalgia lupus and
[1803.68 - 1808.80] so much more neurological lyme so if
[1806.16 - 1810.96] you're not so sick and you you hear some
[1808.80 - 1814.00] antiquated outdated information about
[1810.96 - 1816.48] how good fats are for you and how it's
[1814.00 - 1818.56] just the omega-6s like sunflower oil you
[1816.48 - 1819.76] need to look out for you're totally
[1818.56 - 1821.36] behind
[1819.76 - 1823.52] this is
[1821.36 - 1825.44] advanced information yeah if you're
[1823.52 - 1827.20] coming from a standard american diet or
[1825.44 - 1829.12] standard european diet you come from
[1827.20 - 1831.28] just a junk food diet and you go and you
[1829.12 - 1832.56] eat a healthy keto diet plant-based or
[1831.28 - 1833.84] animal protein you're going to see
[1832.56 - 1835.76] benefits
[1833.84 - 1837.28] but if you're somebody who's really sick
[1835.76 - 1838.80] and you're going down and out for the
[1837.28 - 1840.56] count and you can't function and you
[1838.80 - 1842.00] can't feed your kids or you can't work
[1840.56 - 1843.52] or you can't drive your car and you're
[1842.00 - 1846.32] on mattress island
[1843.52 - 1847.36] any fat will stop you from healing
[1846.32 - 1849.36] so
[1847.36 - 1851.04] i love when someone tries to school me
[1849.36 - 1852.80] like i don't know something they give me
[1851.04 - 1854.64] outdated antiquated information some
[1852.80 - 1856.16] from some vegan doctor that just doesn't
[1854.64 - 1858.40] even know why anybody's sick but you
[1856.16 - 1859.92] know what that's just the way it goes
[1858.40 - 1862.24] the point is
[1859.92 - 1863.44] and where i'm going here right
[1862.24 - 1865.44] is that
[1863.44 - 1867.44] this is about no knowledge and it's
[1865.44 - 1869.92] about taking control of your health and
[1867.44 - 1871.36] anybody new here and coming here
[1869.92 - 1873.36] i'm not trying to lecture you guys on
[1871.36 - 1875.36] this anybody new here are coming here
[1873.36 - 1879.12] you're going to be like what
[1875.36 - 1880.00] what bugs i don't have any bugs huh

[1891.36 - 1895.44] around this is good for all of that but
[1894.00 - 1896.80] again because a lot of new people come
[1895.44 - 1898.56] on board and they don't know they're
[1896.80 - 1900.32] just like okay what's he even talking

[2397.12 - 2401.68] bigger right
[2399.60 - 2403.36] but i like them hunky
[2401.68 - 2406.68] but you can make them smaller if you

[2415.28 - 2419.12] you guys okay with that
[2416.96 - 2421.12] i'm cutting off the root of the radish
[2419.12 - 2422.96] i'm cutting off the back of the radish
[2421.12 - 2424.56] just just for aesthetics of course you
[2422.96 - 2426.88] could eat those if you really wanted to
[2424.56 - 2428.56] right and i'm just going to basically
[2426.88 - 2430.72] thinly slice
[2428.56 - 2433.68] some radishes right here the board's
[2430.72 - 2436.96] really slick because of the potato
[2433.68 - 2439.68] it slicks up the board right
[2436.96 - 2441.60] i'm gonna thinly slice some radishes
[2439.68 - 2443.68] right here you guys what i love about
[2441.60 - 2447.60] this dish it's so good for you these
[2443.68 - 2452.04] radishes are really a powerful food
[2447.60 - 2452.04] i'm gonna slice them a little thinner
[2452.56 - 2456.48] so
[2454.16 - 2459.52] nice and thin
[2456.48 - 2461.60] look you can be you right you can do it
[2459.52 - 2463.52] the way you want to do it i'm just
[2461.60 - 2466.08] showing you the recipe the way i like to
[2463.52 - 2468.56] do it i like the thin radishes
[2466.08 - 2468.56] there we go
[2468.96 - 2472.32] but of course you guys
[2472.48 - 2476.08] can make it the way you want to
[2476.80 - 2481.84] i'm gonna put a little bit more radish
[2478.40 - 2481.84] in mine if you guys don't mind
[2483.36 - 2487.28] now what i love about the radish
[2487.36 - 2492.16] is i talk about it life-changing foods
[2489.36 - 2495.76] removing toxic heavy metals it does help
[2492.16 - 2497.52] with removing metals
[2495.76 - 2500.64] i also love about the radish it's
[2497.52 - 2504.72] anti-bug it's anti-viral
[2500.64 - 2505.48] the radish is anti-bug anti-viral
[2504.72 - 2507.20] so
[2505.48 - 2510.32] anti-bacteria
[2507.20 - 2512.72] so ulcers people with ulcers
[2510.32 - 2514.56] radishes
[2512.72 - 2515.84] okay
[2514.56 - 2518.72] radishes
[2515.84 - 2520.96] help to knock out that bacteria you know
[2518.72 - 2522.32] people have bacteria all in their mouth
[2520.96 - 2524.48] with what about that they have the
[2522.32 - 2526.64] bacteria all in their mouth
[2524.48 - 2528.08] they're losing their teeth
[2526.64 - 2529.76] you know i mean the gums are getting
[2528.08 - 2531.04] eaten away they get the cavities but you
[2529.76 - 2533.12] know what happens though it's all the
[2531.04 - 2535.12] caffeine and the vinegar that weakens
[2533.12 - 2538.72] the enamel so bacteria in somebody's
[2535.12 - 2540.48] mouth can eat away so easily
[2538.72 - 2544.48] everybody gets the reckoning in the
[2540.48 - 2546.32] dentist chair doing the caffeine
[2544.48 - 2548.16] doing the caffeine for too many years
[2546.32 - 2550.40] they get the reckoning in the dentist
[2548.16 - 2552.88] chair
[2550.40 - 2555.04] the caffeine and the unless you're a
[2552.88 - 2556.72] child and you didn't do all the caffeine
[2555.04 - 2559.60] you just came in with severe mineral
[2556.72 - 2559.60] deficiencies
[2560.00 - 2563.92] high levels of mercury too and then that
[2562.24 - 2566.00] could happen but you know everybody gets
[2563.92 - 2568.56] the reckoning down the road too if their
[2566.00 - 2571.36] teeth are pretty good to start with next
[2568.56 - 2575.60] thing you know it down the road
[2571.36 - 2577.52] i'm doing some thin slices of cucumber
[2575.60 - 2579.92] the vinegar and the caffeine really
[2577.52 - 2582.24] weaken the enamel so that bacteria can
[2579.92 - 2584.16] start eating away what i love about the
[2582.24 - 2587.36] radishes i was talking about before with
[2584.16 - 2589.20] the radish is the radish does
[2587.36 - 2591.36] knock down bacteria in the mouth and
[2589.20 - 2593.60] your celery juice does too your celery
[2591.36 - 2595.20] just does so i'm putting some pieces of
[2593.60 - 2596.32] cucumber in here i'm going to mix this
[2595.20 - 2599.36] up too

[2930.72 - 2936.12] keep that in mind asparagus is an
[2932.80 - 2938.64] incredible food for the liver
[2936.12 - 2940.48] detoxifying for the liver
[2938.64 - 2943.52] keep that in mind there that's important
[2940.48 - 2948.08] to know okay
[2943.52 - 2948.08] so asparagus is a really incredible food
[2948.96 - 2955.64] all right so i'm going to mix this up
[2951.84 - 2955.64] let me grab a spoon
[2957.28 - 2960.40] i'm going to put a little bit of lemon
[2958.72 - 2961.52] on here too the healing foods in here
[2960.40 - 2963.92] you know what kind of healing foods we
[2961.52 - 2965.84] have in here cucumbers credible for the
[2963.92 - 2967.92] kidneys people with kidney disease
[2965.84 - 2969.68] should be eating cucumbers every day
[2967.92 - 2971.92] incredible think about that right there
[2969.68 - 2974.64] asparagus cleans the liver asparagus is
[2971.92 - 2977.28] anti-viral anti-bug it's a bug killer
[2974.64 - 2980.32] i'm putting lemon juice on here right
[2977.28 - 2985.44] lemon juice you got that calcium and
[2980.32 - 2988.72] that vitamin c so important really is
[2985.44 - 2991.12] you got the radishes radishes enter into
[2988.72 - 2993.68] the thyroid and start knocking out
[2991.12 - 2996.56] epstein-barr that's what radishes do
[2993.68 - 2998.96] think about that parsley feeds every
[2996.56 - 3001.28] cell in the body strengthens the immune
[2998.96 - 3006.12] system right you know parsley is an
[3001.28 - 3006.12] incredible herb so i'm mixing this up
[3013.36 - 3017.76] this is just this is an amazing dish
[3015.52 - 3019.44] right here you can eat this all day long
[3017.76 - 3021.20] if you want i'm gonna make a quick
[3019.44 - 3022.64] announcement too
[3021.20 - 3025.12] there we go
[3022.64 - 3026.88] this is the potato salad you know what's
[3025.12 - 3028.88] missing in here
[3026.88 - 3031.84] huh
[3028.88 - 3034.08] there's no oil in here that's missing
[3031.84 - 3036.56] there's no eggs in here no there's no
[3034.08 - 3040.08] cheese in here right that's missing what
[3036.56 - 3041.20] else is missing in here right no dairy
[3040.08 - 3042.40] no butter
[3041.20 - 3044.72] right
[3042.40 - 3046.96] and what happens is when you do this fat
[3044.72 - 3049.12] free healing meal
[3046.96 - 3051.68] that's how you allow bugs to leave your
[3049.12 - 3052.96] system you if you're tanking too much
[3051.68 - 3054.72] fat
[3052.96 - 3058.40] you can't even get all the bugs you want
[3054.72 - 3061.84] out that's why i like level three level
[3058.40 - 3064.40] four level five level five because when
[3061.84 - 3066.16] you go further down the levels
[3064.40 - 3068.32] you're actually allowing more bugs to
[3066.16 - 3070.88] get out of the system but level one
[3068.32 - 3072.40] starts killing off bugs too but hey how
[3070.88 - 3075.36] far do you want to go
[3072.40 - 3078.32] see you guys that meal right there
[3075.36 - 3081.36] isn't bug fuel it also doesn't thicken
[3078.32 - 3083.76] the blood it doesn't dehydrate the body
[3081.36 - 3085.52] and it doesn't contribute to toxins
[3083.76 - 3088.08] inside the body those are the four
[3085.52 - 3091.04] groups that doesn't happen with this
[3088.08 - 3093.12] recipe keep that in mind okay
[3091.04 - 3096.40] it's an incredible recipe i want to make
[3093.12 - 3097.92] a quick announcement 6 15. later
