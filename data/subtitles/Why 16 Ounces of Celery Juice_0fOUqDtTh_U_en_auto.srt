1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:04,350
the greatest mistake you can make is

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:07,160
mixing things in your celery juice it's

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:09,660
critical you don't mix water ice cubes

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:11,910
lemon-lime other fruits and vegetables

5
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:14,219
collagen apple cider vinegar charcoal

6
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:16,379
protein powder or anything in your

7
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:18,090
celery juice this is how it works when

8
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:20,400
you add those things in you dilute that

9
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:22,289
chemical compounds so when you drink

10
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,300
your celery juice it doesn't do what

11
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:26,670
it's supposed to do I was suffering with

12
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:29,160
like really difficult to digestive

13
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:31,349
problems like constipation lots of gas

14
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:35,250
and bloating celery juice is the newest

15
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:37,140
thing out there medical medium cures

16
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:39,329
everything I started noticing my body

17
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:41,280
coming back to life right away when you

18
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:43,320
drink 16 ounces of solar juice on an

19
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,480
empty stomach that's where the magic is

20
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,579
that's where the miracle powers are it

21
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,530
enters into your gastric glands it

22
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:52,289
rebuilds them so they can produce

23
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:54,480
hydrochloric acid to break down proteins

24
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:56,460
so proteins don't rot in your gut and

25
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,559
then it goes into your small intestinal

26
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,940
tract where it runs into food that you

27
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,859
might have in there from the dinner

28
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:05,250
before then it has to kill off pathogens

29
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:07,470
bacteria viruses yeast mold unproductive

30
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:09,330
fungus then it travels down it has to

31
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:11,220
eventually get into the liver through

32
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:12,810
the paddock portal vein once it's in

33
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,520
your liver it builds up your bio

34
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:16,950
reserves helping to improve your

35
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,540
digestion by breaking down fats then

36
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:20,490
after that it heads to the gallbladder

37
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:23,159
and starts to dissolve the gall stones

38
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:25,409
and that's why it has to be at least 16

39
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:27,270
ounces to have enough liquid to get

40
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:29,369
through the entire obstacle course that

41
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:31,320
you have in your body so you can heal

42
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:33,299
and move forward one of the first things

43
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:36,030
that I started doing that I read from

44
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:37,920
his book was the 16 ounces of celery

45
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:39,869
juice in the morning on an empty

46
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,270
stomach I remember just feeling like ah

47
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:44,430
yes this is what I needed and it

48
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:46,560
instantly clicked for me the reason why

49
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:48,840
you have to juice celery is because if

50
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,360
you leave the pulp or the fiber in there

51
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,189
it won't work when you leave the fiber

52
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,770
and the pulp you're trapping the

53
00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:57,990
medicine slowing it down stopping your

54
00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:00,689
digestion so you can't get the medicine

55
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:03,119
to work if you drink tea you don't eat

56
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:05,159
the teabags you have to extract the

57
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,689
medicine out of it and consume it

58
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:09,660
without the pulp in the fiber it's the

59
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:22,370
only way it's going to help you heal

60
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:24,430
