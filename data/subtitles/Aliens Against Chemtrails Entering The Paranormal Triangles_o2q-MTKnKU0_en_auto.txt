[0.32 - 4.24] I'm sure you've heard about the
[1.84 - 6.16] paranormal triangles, the Alaska
[4.24 - 8.64] triangle and the Bermuda Triangle and
[6.16 - 10.48] many more. Now, not all the triangles
[8.64 - 13.24] that people are talking about out there
[10.48 - 16.16] are legit. People are looking for
[13.24 - 18.08] triangles. They're interested. They want
[16.16 - 21.52] many triangles out there, and there are
[18.08 - 24.32] many, but not every triangle people say
[21.52 - 26.96] is a triangle is a mysterious paranormal
[24.32 - 29.56] triangle. And one of the things is
[26.96 - 32.72] paranormal triangles aren't just
[29.56 - 35.96] triangle. They're circles. They've been
[32.72 - 39.24] identified and estimated as
[35.96 - 42.48] triangles. They've been noted as
[39.24 - 45.32] triangles, documented as triangles, but
[42.48 - 48.08] in reality, not all of them are
[45.32 - 50.00] triangles. They're actually circles.
[48.08 - 52.56] They're areas that are actually
[50.00 - 54.96] circular. And in these paranormal
[52.56 - 57.20] triangles, which are actually circular,
[54.96 - 59.52] at least most of them are, there's a lot
[57.20 - 62.76] of UFO sightings. There's a lot of
[59.52 - 65.32] sightings of light beams, of light
[62.76 - 67.64] circles, of crafts, of
[65.32 - 70.40] spaceships, also
[67.64 - 73.04] disappearances, missing ships, missing
[70.40 - 75.76] planes over the last 100 years. So,
[73.04 - 79.20] where do chemtrails and geoengineering
[75.76 - 82.68] trails fall into this? Where do these
[79.20 - 82.68] play a role?
