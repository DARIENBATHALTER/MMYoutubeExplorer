1
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:07,319

2
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:10,019
so I'm excited you guys

3
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:12,599
some powerful information

4
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:14,780
so I'm in medical medium right New

5
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:14,780
Edition

6
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:20,160
and soul healing meditations and

7
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:22,380
techniques and by the way are you doing

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,199
the Stones The Three Stones

9
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:27,359
because that's really powerful I can't

10
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,160
even tell you it's incredible it's in

11
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,300
here so

12
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,040
we're going to talk about some other

13
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,040
stuff too good to see you guys

14
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,440
foreign

15
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:41,120
so everybody is soul searching

16
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,739
someone once told me

17
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:48,420
you're either soul searching

18
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:51,780
or you're not

19
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:54,000
and then Spirit of compassion said

20
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:57,180
you're either soul-searching

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,140
or you're soul-searching

22
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:03,899
because that's the truth

23
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:05,700
even if somebody doesn't know it even if

24
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:07,979
they don't call it that so that's

25
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:10,619
another thing like

26
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:13,140
you may run into somebody

27
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:14,820
and

28
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,340
it doesn't seem they don't think they're

29
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:21,439
soul-searching on any level they're just

30
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,439
doing their thing living their life

31
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,740
but they don't know their soul searching

32
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:28,259
they're soul-searching but they don't

33
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:30,299
call it that

34
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:33,200
they're not aware that it's

35
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:33,200
soul-searching right

36
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:38,299
we soul-search because part of us feels

37
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:38,299
lost

38
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:43,799
how many people do you know have that

39
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:47,220
feeling of being lost that lost

40
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:50,600
sensation like a sadness

41
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:50,600
at a certain time of day

42
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,579
what if it's like three four o'clock in

43
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:58,619
the afternoon and then a strange sadness

44
00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:00,479
comes over

45
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:02,880
I know so many people that have it at

46
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,880
different times and it's this thing you

47
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,259

48
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,340

49
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:10,920

52
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:21,000
we Soul search because part of us feels

53
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:23,760
lost or we don't feel whole like there's

54
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,819

piece of ourselves missing

58
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:42,900
or because we feel like we're not living

59
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:46,739
up to our Soul's potential we

60
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:48,720

of them will prompt a person to feel

83
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:49,080

something happened in your life and it

88
00:03:54,420 --> 00:04:01,220
just pushed you over the edge

89
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:01,220
like you were on your last tether

90
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:06,720
if you were a bird you felt like you

91
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:09,140
were on your last feathers I mean where

92
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:13,439
you just felt like you were pushed over

93
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:15,239
hanging on the cliff like done

94
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,799
did you ever use that term where you're

95
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:18,780
like I'm done

96
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:21,320
I'm done

97
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:21,320
right

98
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,280
so many people have felt like that where

99
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,199
they're at a place where like okay I'm

100
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:30,960
done or this relationship so many people

101
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:32,880
they're in a relationship that's toxic

102
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,620
there's a lot of emotional turmoil in

103
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,120
the relationship there's a lot going on

104
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:38,040
in the relationship and they're just

105
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:41,360
like I'm done I can't take this anymore

106
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,360
I can't handle this anymore

107
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,440
so often a negative experience or a

108
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:49,620
series of them will prompt a person to

109
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:51,840
feel broken or depleted and want to feel

110
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:54,120
complete again it's like I want to feel

111
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,220
whole again I want to feel like myself

112
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:58,440
again and maybe I don't even know what

113
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:59,699
myself felt like but I want to feel it I

114
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,680
want to feel

115
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:05,940
like I got

116
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:09,180
all those pieces of my soul back I want

117
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:11,520
to feel like I'm not lost

118
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:14,160
I want to feel like connected to

119
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,720
something I want that sensation I want

120
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,000
that feeling and if you have chronic

121
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,620
illness and you don't feel good and

122
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,500
you're struggling with chronic illness

123
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:25,199
then it really amplifies it

124
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:28,259
makes it even harder

125
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:30,539
I'm glad you guys came on we're doing

126
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:32,520

127
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:35,340

words right here

131
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,320
and then

132
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:45,060
I'm listening to try to get additional

133
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:48,300
information from Spirit of compassion

134
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:51,680
about all this about how we feel what we

135
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:54,539
go through all of that so I'm reading

136
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,780
soc's words because these are not my

137
00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:56,780
words

138
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:03,199
these are Spirit compassions words right

00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,800
that feeling of wanting to be complete

141
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:13,680
again

142
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:17,820
that feeling of not wanting to feel lost

143
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:22,259
that feeling of no one understands me

144
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:24,300
that feeling of something's missing

145
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:26,160
that's when we need that soul searching

146
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:28,400
that's part of soul searching right

147
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,400
there

148
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:36,120
it can take the form of attending

149
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,740
Retreats how many people attend Retreats

150
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,600

151
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:42,180
people

152
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,160
are looking for something

153
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:46,560
so they'll go anywhere and they'll do

154
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,780
anything they're looking for answers or

155
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:52,039
they're looking for that piece of what's

156
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:52,039
lost to come back

157
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,100
sometimes it takes going to hear

158
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:58,919

00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:00,660

our soul and we want to heal

191
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:28,139
a lot of stuff's coming up in a lot of

192
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:32,880
people that were at the light blast

193
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:34,740
by the way I'm at on page 393 so p393 in

194

199
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:47,279
it's it's really discounted right now

200
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,320
this book

201
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:51,240
and it's a book that so many people

202
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,100
found answers to what was wrong with

203
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:55,920
them and how to heal and it covers

204
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:58,800
emotional and spiritual and physical

205
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,779
this is one of the most profound books

206
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,399
out there in the world of healing for

207
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:04,260
people

208
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,360
I can say that because it's Spirit of

209
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:08,820
compassion's work so I'm not being

210
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:10,980
biased in the sense where it's my work

211
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:14,540
it's just I'm the messenger and I wrote

212
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:14,540
down the words as I heard them

213
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:22,140
Reina says thank you with a heart I

214
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:25,680
asked for the light to help heal my soul

215
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:29,580
that has been stepped on too many times

216
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:33,420
the first light blast went through me

217
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:35,760
and such a release instant tears my soul

218
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:37,640
feels lighter and Freer

219
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,959
and that healing is going to continue

220
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:41,519
with the light blast because the light

221
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:45,200
blast isn't

222
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,200
it isn't a person

223
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:52,260
that's trying to generate the light

224
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:54,300
it's not a person

225
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:55,740
as many times as people who met me

226
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:57,959
throughout the decades and said well

227
00:09:55,740 --> 00:10:00,800
that medical medium guy's a Healer go

228
00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:00,800
see him and everything

229
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:08,220
the light comes from above and it's not

230
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:11,100
man-made so I I don't I'm not perfect

231
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:12,779
I'm like everybody else in the world

232
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:15,180
not perfect

233
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:16,620
have my own experiences I have my own

234
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:18,180
baggage I've had to contend with

235
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:21,240
throughout my life

236
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:24,600
just like everybody else and so the

237
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:27,420
light blast isn't coming from me

238
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:29,820
pure it's untampered with it's coming

239
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:31,320
from above and when that happens it's an

240
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:33,959
entirely different experience and that's

241
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:37,019
why so many people are profound in a

242
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:39,200
profound results or or experiences with

243
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:39,200
it

244
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:46,440
your soul

245
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:49,100
resides in your brain something people

246
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,100
don't know

247
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:54,800
their soul resides here

248
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:00,260
and resides here

249
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:06,060
now this is going to sound kind of gory

250
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:08,459
I know it's kind of a little off topic

251
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:10,880
but it's not really off topic it's a

252
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,880
little gory

253
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:15,380
but back in the olden days

254
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:21,380
the reason why they beheaded people that

255
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:24,480
was a very popular

256
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:27,180
technique is because back in the olden

257
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:31,760
days they sensed

258
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:31,760
there was an energy all around here

259
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,360
so what they would do is

260
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,860
medieval times they would put it they

261
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:40,880
would chop people's heads off and put

262
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:40,880
their heads on spikes

263
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:46,620
right or Pikes or something they would

264
00:11:44,459 --> 00:11:48,540
put their heads on sticks

265
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:49,920
on the sides of roads and all that or

266
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:52,940
they would be head people with

267
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,940
Guillotines right

268
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:57,839
for some reason they felt like that was

269
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:00,000
the most satisfying way to end

270
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,920
somebody's life because there was

271
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,959
something more satiating about it in the

272
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,279
medieval days and what they what they

273
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:07,620
were actually tapping into without

274
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:09,540
realizing it there was a lot going on

275
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:11,399
here

276
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:13,140
but they didn't know that's where the

277
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:15,660
soul resides and that's why they had a

278
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:18,779
desire to behead people because the soul

279
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:21,779
resided in the head

280
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:23,760
they didn't know that

281
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:25,880
they didn't know the soul resided in the

282
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,880
head

283
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:30,000
but they had this innate desire when

284
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,920
they wanted to end somebody's life to

285
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,279
behead them to chop off their head that

286
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:38,720
was what that is why they did that and

287
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:41,579
then they had this innate desire to

288
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,899
exhibit someone's head chopped off they

289
00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:46,200
had this innate desire to actually

290
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:48,600
exhibit it so exhibit the head on a pike

291
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:51,060
on the sides of Roads or in villages

292
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:52,740
where they would slay a village and then

293
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:55,260
they would chop off everybody's head and

294
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:59,639
put it on Pikes because

295
00:12:55,260 --> 00:13:02,220
they felt that a message was sent more

296
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:05,300
because and what it was was what they

297
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:05,300
were detecting

298
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:11,040
yeah it's gory but what they were what

299
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:13,139
they were detecting was there was more

300
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,420
energy here even though the whole body

301
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:17,339
there was more body weight and body mass

302
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:19,620
everywhere else there was more energy

303
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:21,300
here

304
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:24,260
so what they were detecting without

305
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:26,880
release without

306
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:29,459
realizing it they were detecting the

307
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:31,019
soul was here inside the brain so they

308
00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:32,820
had a great desire if they wanted to end

309
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:35,040
somebody's life back in the in the

310
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:38,180
medieval the Dark Ages they would

311
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,180
chop off the head

312
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:47,160
your soul resides in your brain

313
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:48,660
where your soul stores memories and

314
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:51,180
experiences

315
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:53,940
that's where your soul is storing

316
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:56,700
memories and experiences

317
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:59,339
they're in the soul when our soul leaves

318
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:03,560
our body it takes

319
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:03,560
these experiences with it

320
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:11,639
when you pass from this Mortal Realm

321
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:16,380
your soul carries

322
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:18,660
those memories as it moves onward

323
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:22,040
your soul carries those memories as it

324
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:22,040
moves onward if you guys want to know

325
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:26,940
I'm reading at a medical medium I think

326
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:28,680
what people don't know if they don't

327
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:30,060
read the medical medium books you know

328
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,760
how you know when someone didn't read

329
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:34,380
the medical media books

330
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:36,360
this is just on another note you guys we

331
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:39,420
got a lot to cover but

332
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:42,300
let's get bear with me my silliness but

333
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:45,060
you know how you know someone did did

334
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:47,100
not read the medical medium books is

335
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:49,980
when they say there's no emotional

336
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:53,399
healing in medical medium information

337
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:57,000
and there's no emotional detoxification

338
00:14:53,399 --> 00:15:00,300
healing or emotional work

339
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,160
the medical medium books

340
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:04,940
and there's no or they'll say there's no

341
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:08,160
emotional support it's like

342
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:10,199
oh you didn't read the books you just

343
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,600
called yourself out pretty much that

344
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:14,160
means you've read about celery juice in

345
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,560
one of the books a little bit and then

346
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,120
you just kind of like maybe you did the

347
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,160
heavy metal detox movie but you never

348
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:22,620
read the books they're so packed with

349
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:25,260
emotional support it's insane

350
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:27,600
every time a doctor friend or a friend

351
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:29,279
or somebody I know

352
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,420
picks up the books again they start

353
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,100
reading them they're like I've never

354
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:34,380
seen so much emotional support in my

355
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:36,060
life in a book that also has medical and

356
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:37,620
physical combined it's the craziest

357
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:41,660
thing

358
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:41,660
anyway so I'm in medical medium book one

359
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:49,740
so when we pass from this Mortal place

360
00:15:46,139 --> 00:15:52,680
this Mortal realm right our soul carries

361
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:55,199
these memories as it moves onward even

362
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:57,240
if someone has a brain injury or brain

363
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:59,820
disease that keeps her or him from

364
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:01,800
remembering certain things so

365
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:04,620
hear this for a second so if somebody

366
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:07,380
has Alzheimer's dementia

367
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:10,079
if someone is losing their train of

368
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:15,139
thought losing their mind

369
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:15,139
and they pass away from a brain disease

370
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:21,600
even if someone has a brain injury or

371
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:24,360
brain disease like Alzheimer's or

372
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:27,180
dementia or something like that

373
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:29,220
encephalopathy right that keeps her or

374
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:31,139
him from remembering certain things the

375
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:33,300
soul will bring all those memories with

376
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:35,940
it when that person passes on if you

377
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:38,339
have a grandfather a grandmother or a

378
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:40,440
family member or a friend that is losing

379
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:42,660
their mind because they have the

380
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:44,459
Alzheimer's they have dementia they're

381
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:45,839
really suffering they don't even know

382
00:16:44,459 --> 00:16:49,860
who they are they lose their memory

383
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:53,160
completely and they pass away

384
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:55,680
you have to remember something

385
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:58,259
the pain and suffering a loved one has

386
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:00,000
says where did their memories go don't

387
00:16:58,259 --> 00:17:01,800
they remember me how come they don't

388
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,940
remember me how come they don't see who

389
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:05,160
I am

390
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:08,280
my grandfather's sitting there and he

391
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:11,280
knows me I he raised me I'm walking into

392
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:14,839
the room and my grandfather's saying how

393
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,839
are you I don't know who you are

394
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:19,620
you have to remember that every member

395
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,480
memory that that grandfather has

396
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:24,000
grandmother that friend that mother

397
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:26,100
father that brother sister every memory

398
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:30,600
that they have about you in their life

399
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:33,780
is still trapped in there it's in there

400
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:35,880
just because the brain disease is eating

401
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:37,620
away neurons it doesn't mean the soul

402
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:39,240
doesn't take those memories with it

403
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:41,039
that's the whole point and what I

404
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:45,240
learned from Spirit of compassion is the

405
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:46,980
soul takes those memories with

406
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:49,320
with it

407
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:51,600
as it leaves

408
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:54,419
so it's not like that family member

409
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:56,760
their lives are just completely wiped

410
00:17:54,419 --> 00:18:00,419
out and completely gone it's not like

411
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:01,980
that at all it it's the opposite yes in

412
00:18:00,419 --> 00:18:04,799
that moment it feels that way but when

413
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:06,240
they leave and their soul passes on they

414
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:09,360
have all the memories there they didn't

415
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,520
lose that they know who you are

416
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:13,080
foreign

417
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:15,660
father grandmother or friend or family

418
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:18,600
member's soul is leaving them as they

419
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:21,419
pass in that moment even if they lost

420
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:24,900
ability to understand who you were as

421
00:18:21,419 --> 00:18:27,780
they were fading away they still when

422
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:30,980
they leave and that Soul lifts up

423
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:30,980
from that body

424
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:37,380
they instantly know you

425
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:39,780
Who You Are

426
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:42,179
every memory they shared with you

427
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:43,860
everything about you all that they've

428
00:18:42,179 --> 00:18:47,640
done with you every experience they've

429
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:51,720
ever had with you they know and they see

430
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:53,900
it and see you as their soul leaves the

431
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,900
body

432
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:04,320
I think someone said I never knew that

433
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:06,000
the information's not out there

434
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,700
unless it was

435
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,140
taken from the medical medium books but

436
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:12,480
this is all Spirit of compassion's

437
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:13,559
information there's no citations in the

438
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,320
books ever

439
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:19,320
ever because I'm not taking one piece of

440
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:22,860
information from anyone

441
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:26,840
so there's no citations the books are

442
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:26,840
just unique information from above

443
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:32,760
your soul also stores your hope people

444
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:34,980
don't realize that that their soul

445
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:37,799
actually stores their hope you think you

446
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:40,080
you think you're hopeless you're not

447
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:42,860
you think you have no hope anymore uh-uh

448
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,860
that's not true

449
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:48,299
you think you've lost all your hope no

450
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:50,460
no no no no no no no no

451
00:19:48,299 --> 00:19:54,720
you didn't lose all your hope

452
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:57,679
your hope is stored it's stored

453
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,679
in your soul

454
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:05,660
there's a well of it in your soul

455
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:05,660
your soul also stores faith

456
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:14,400
if you have faith in God your soul

457
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:18,860
stores that faith if you have faith in

458
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,860
Jesus Christ your soul stores that faith

459
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:25,860
see there's a question on Instagram

460
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:28,559
heal with Haley says why can't we

461
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:31,700
access the memories our soul already has

462
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:31,700
from before this life

463
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,860
there's a reason

464
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,600
Spirit of compassion has told me my

465
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:44,280
whole life why

466
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:46,520
and I'm going to be sharing about that

467
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,520
soon

468
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:51,059
I read that comment because I plan on

469
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:53,640
sharing about that soon

470
00:20:51,059 --> 00:20:56,039
and it's going to be mind-blowing

471
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:57,480
absolutely mind-blowing

472
00:20:56,039 --> 00:20:59,160
but I have to share about it properly

473
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:02,460
too so people

474
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:04,080
cite the source

475
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:05,460
because someone's just going to take it

476
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,780
next you know it someone's going to say

477
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:09,080
oh

478
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:11,640
this heat well-known

479
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:12,960
Mastermind guy or healer or whatever you

480
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,400
wouldn't believe what he said and

481
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,320
they're just gonna just butcher it

482
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,880
they're gonna butcher it because they

483
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:20,100
don't know all of it and they're gonna

484
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:23,419
try to run with a golden nugget so they

485
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:27,299
can get more likes and views

486
00:21:23,419 --> 00:21:30,179
and sell more programs

487
00:21:27,299 --> 00:21:31,860
so we got to do it right so people have

488
00:21:30,179 --> 00:21:34,460
all of the info and they know where to

489
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:36,500
get it so they can heal

490
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:40,679
foreign

491
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:42,780
also stores your faith that means if you

492
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:46,140
have faith in Jesus Christ your soul

493
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:47,820
stores it if you think you if you're if

494
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:49,440
you're a Christian and you have faith in

495
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:51,419
Jesus Christ that for some reason you're

496
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:54,659
a Christian and you lost faith in Jesus

497
00:21:51,419 --> 00:21:58,760
Christ I promise you this your soul

498
00:21:54,659 --> 00:21:58,760
still has faith in Jesus Christ

499
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:08,100
if you're someone that's not a Christian

500
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:10,380
and you just believe in God and God

501
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:11,940
God is who you believe in and you have

502
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:13,380
faith in God and you have tremendous

503
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:14,820
faith in God and then all of a sudden

504
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:17,039
something happens to you in your life

505
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:19,380
and you lose faith in God I promise you

506
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:22,580
this your soul still stores

507
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:22,580
your faith in God

508
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:30,299
Thomas Phoenix 82 on Instagram said I

509
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:32,640
wanted to die

510
00:22:30,299 --> 00:22:35,640
and now I have my life back and it's all

511
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:39,020
because of medical medium info thank you

512
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:42,559
aw and SOC

513
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:42,559
sfc says you're welcome

514
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:46,340
all right

515
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,720
if you think you lost trust and you had

516
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,400
Trust

517
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:56,400
and now you can't trust anything anymore

518
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:58,980
and you can't trust anyone anymore

519
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:01,140
you can't trust anyone you can't trust

520
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:04,760
anything anymore because you lost trust

521
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:04,760
I can promise you this

522
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:11,960
that you have trust stored

523
00:23:09,059 --> 00:23:11,960
in your soul

524
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:18,960
the reason for that is it helps to keep

525
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:21,900
us on the right path so we stay

526
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:25,140
stay present here

527
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:26,580
ideally we would all have fully intact

528
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:28,740
Souls

529
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:31,500
over the course of life's hardships

530
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:33,240
though a soul can become fractured and

531
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:36,140
even loose pieces of itself but that's

532
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:36,140
okay because

533
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,000
we still never lose our soul

534
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:45,960
this can be caused by traumatic events

535
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:48,179
traumatic events can fracture our soul

536
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:51,539
but that's all right

537
00:23:48,179 --> 00:23:54,980
because her soul can mend and heal

538
00:23:51,539 --> 00:23:57,480
our soul is unbreakable it is

539
00:23:54,980 --> 00:24:00,179
unbreakable regardless of a fracture

540
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:01,559
regardless

541
00:24:00,179 --> 00:24:04,260
of

542
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:06,720
hardships beating it down and wearing

543
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:09,720
and tearing on your soul it is

544
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,720
Unbreakable

545
00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:16,320
this can be caused by traumatic events

546
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:18,000
such as the death of a loved one so many

547
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:20,880
people go through

548
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,460
betrayal by a loved one or betrayal of

549
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:25,380
oneself as well as ongoing traumas such

550
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:27,059
as the loss of freedom and trust that

551
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:29,460
comes with experiencing chronic symptoms

552
00:24:27,059 --> 00:24:31,380
and illness I think so many people have

553
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:33,419
been beaten down with their illness

554
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:35,760
you guys know about that

555
00:24:33,419 --> 00:24:37,320
you had symptoms

556
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,820
or you still have them because you just

557
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:40,559
found medical medium and you're working

558
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:42,600
on your healing process but you bend

559
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:45,539
down that road and you had so many

560
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:50,360
symptoms and suffered greatly so bad and

561
00:24:45,539 --> 00:24:50,360
that wears and tears on the soul

562
00:24:54,900 --> 00:25:00,900
many throughout the years I would

563
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:04,380
through a process that Spirit of

564
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:06,419
compassion has has taught me to scan

565
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:09,299
someone

566
00:25:06,419 --> 00:25:13,400
and spirit of compassion would show me

567
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:13,400
if they had any fractures on their soul

568
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:19,980
and it resembled cracks in a cathedral

569
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:21,059
window that's what it resembled when I

570
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:23,780
would see it through Spirit of

571
00:25:21,059 --> 00:25:23,780
compassion's eyes

572
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:29,039
because the soul is made out of light

573
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:31,760
and when someone's been through

574
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,760
hardships

575
00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:41,059
so I think we have a tech problem

576
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:41,059
so I'm just trying to fix it here

577
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:49,159
okay

578
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,919
because our soul is made out of light

579
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:01,520
because

580
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:01,520
our souls are a form of light

581
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:07,020
not when a soul is fractured

582
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:09,419
it looks like the sun it looks like the

583
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:11,460
inside like you're inside a

584
00:26:09,419 --> 00:26:13,799
the church

585
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:17,659
and the stained glass windows

586
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:17,659
there's light coming through the Sun

587
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:23,640
as for a soul with missing pieces it's

588
00:26:21,659 --> 00:26:25,919
like a house at night that's meant to

589
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:29,360
have all its lights on except some of

590
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:29,360
its rooms are still dark

591
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:36,620
when Soul injuries are fresh

592
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:41,820
they can result in the feeling of being

593
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:43,980
lost

594
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:46,400
foreign

595
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:49,500
or a loss of connection with oneself

596
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:51,960
loss of Desire or inspiration to

597
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:53,520
preserve or Thrive so many people lose

598
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:55,260
their Inspirations they feel like

599
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:57,480
they're dead inside they feel like they

600
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:59,159
died inside they're numb and they don't

601
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:01,080
feel like there's anything left in them

602
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:03,320
they feel like there's nothing there

603
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,320
anymore

604
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:09,120
they feel like

605
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,919
they are not being seen by anything and

606
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:13,620
they're completely alone and completely

607
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:16,140
in the dark and that's what happens when

608
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:17,580
Soul injuries are actually fresh it just

609
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:21,120
happened

610
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:23,880
I just got let down that person broke my

611
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:26,520
trust I feel so injured I feel so

612
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:28,799
misunderstood and not heard so when the

613
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:31,679
soul injuries are fresh they could

614
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:34,580
result in feeling like

615
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:34,580
you're lost

616
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:40,440
or there's a loss of connection like

617
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,580
where's the connection there's no

618
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:44,460
connection

619
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:47,659
a loss of Desire or inspiration to

620
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:47,659
persevere or thrive

621
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:53,039
or even

622
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:54,900
like life force how many that you guys

623
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:57,120
know that where you feel like you lose

624
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:58,799
your life force

625
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:01,740
because you just

626
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:04,320
had such a hard time

627
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:06,799
that's why it's important to be aware of

628
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:09,600
our soul and that's how you heal

629
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:11,820
emotional support is understanding our

630
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:13,620
own soul because people they don't

631
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:15,900
realize they have this connection to

632
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:18,299
their own soul they don't know how to

633
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:20,820
connect to their own soul

634
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:23,220
when you understand your soul and and

635
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:25,980
understand where it is and and if it's

636
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:28,679
been injured and how strong it is and

637
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:31,799
how powerful it is

638
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:34,260
when you connect to your soul that's how

639
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:37,760
you can really do some emotional healing

640
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:37,760
and rise out of something

641
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:43,980
that's why it's important to be aware of

642
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:47,000
our soul wounds from hardships betrayal

643
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:49,400
and broken trust or emotional hurt often

644
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:52,260
exhaust a person's immune system

645
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:54,480
adrenals and other bodies defenses

646
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:56,520
triggering a physical issue that could

647
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,600
be residing deep within our organs and

648
00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:00,179
body

649
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,440
so it's twofold if you guys go through a

650
00:29:00,179 --> 00:29:02,880
hard time if somebody goes through a

651
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,980
hard time

652
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:08,820
I know a friend that just got betrayed

653
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:11,880
so bad just so bad the Betrayal was just

654
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:13,620
horrendous and he didn't want to live

655
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:17,159
anymore

656
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:21,659
but when he really understood the soul

657
00:29:17,159 --> 00:29:23,580
connection that I was teaching him about

658
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:26,159
it was giving him a chance to say you

659
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:28,740
know I could get through this you can't

660
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:32,120
you can't take my soul away no one's

661
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:32,120
going to be able to take my soul away

662
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:37,380
but at the same time adrenals can get

663
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:39,360
beaten down and our immune systems can

664
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:42,179
can be lowered because we're going

665
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:43,080
through a lot if we're betrayed it does

666
00:29:42,179 --> 00:29:45,779
play

667
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:49,440
it does take a hit on our immune system

668
00:29:45,779 --> 00:29:52,380
and our physical body it can beat us

669
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:54,600
down our adrenals

670
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:57,140
you go into this

671
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:59,760
point where

672
00:29:57,140 --> 00:30:02,880
your adrenaline just spikes and feels

673
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:08,299
like it gets out of control if someone's

674
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:08,299
messing with you or you had a hardship

675
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:14,039
someone just

676
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:15,840
you you know their trust

677
00:30:14,039 --> 00:30:17,399
you don't trust him anymore something

678
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:20,039
happened and all of a sudden it's like

679
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:21,539
adrenaline you can even feel like you're

680
00:30:20,039 --> 00:30:23,880
shaking

681
00:30:21,539 --> 00:30:25,260
you get so upset and hurt where you're

682
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:28,320
shaking

683
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:31,260
and that's the adrenaline now

684
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:33,440
being released and takes a toll on the

685
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:33,440
body

686
00:30:33,539 --> 00:30:39,539
sometimes a person's soul injury

687
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:42,260
and resulting emotional state isn't a

688
00:30:39,539 --> 00:30:42,260
physical problem

689
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:48,240
yet symptoms often take time to build

690
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:50,580
quietly in the background so a soul

691
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:52,200
injury at an earlier time in life could

692
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:54,600
be the trigger

693
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:57,620
for the future symptoms or full-blown

694
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,620
conditions to come

695
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:02,220
if you don't have the right knowledge

696
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:04,919
tools and resources to take care of your

697
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:06,899
soul and physical body

698
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:09,360
we can get in trouble

699
00:31:06,899 --> 00:31:11,820
the medical medium tools are there to

700
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:15,179
support your physical body and your

701
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:17,880
emotional body that's how you win it's

702
00:31:15,179 --> 00:31:22,140
both they're there and even if you don't

703
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:26,220
support your your emotional body

704
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:28,919
and you heal physically it naturally can

705
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:31,140
help to heal the emotional part of what

706
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:33,539
you're going through in your life it can

707
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:36,539
help heal the emotional

708
00:31:33,539 --> 00:31:36,539
injuries

709
00:31:39,899 --> 00:31:45,360
let's be clear

710
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:47,220
emotional wounds and soul wounds

711
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:49,940
are not the reason for physical

712
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:49,940
suffering

713
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:53,659
that's important to know

714
00:31:54,059 --> 00:31:58,380
they are not the cause of physical

715
00:31:56,100 --> 00:32:01,080
suffering

716
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:03,539
they're not the cause of fibromyalgia

717
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:06,539
they're not the cause

718
00:32:03,539 --> 00:32:08,760
of thyroid cancer they're not the cause

719
00:32:06,539 --> 00:32:10,320
a multiple sclerosis

720
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:13,500
or lupus

721
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:15,120
or Lyme disease rather they can act as

722
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:19,380
triggers

723
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:19,380
for underlying susceptibilities

724
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:23,700
when we go through emotional hardships

725
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:26,399
it cannot go so hard it lowers our

726
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:28,380
immune system and it triggers us when we

727
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:30,600
go through emotional hardships our

728
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:32,760
adrenaline can really get kicked into

729
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:35,600
high gear because we're emotionally

730
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:38,940
injured and then we get

731
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:42,480
knocked down a notch

732
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:43,799
it knocks us down I can't tell you how

733
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,260
many people

734
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:48,720
that got into a difficult relationship

735
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:50,820
and it was there was so much turmoil in

736
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:54,000
that relationship there was so much

737
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:56,520
fighting and cheating and betrayal and

738
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,440
that relationship that it lowered the

739
00:32:56,520 --> 00:33:00,600
immune system

740
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:03,600
and when it lowered the immune system it

741
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:07,500
broke them down and other things they

742
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:09,779
had residing inside of them pathogens

743
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:12,620
rose up and now they have chronic

744
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:12,620
fatigue syndrome

745
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:17,659
they become triggers

746
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:23,220
but you're stronger than you know to

747
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:25,919
have battled this long and gotten

748
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:27,779
yourself this far in life now you can

749
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:30,059
rise above

750
00:33:27,779 --> 00:33:32,940
all this is knowledge so you can rise

751
00:33:30,059 --> 00:33:35,820
above your wounds you can rise above the

752
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:37,919
injuries physically that you've had

753
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:40,679
the pathogens

754
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:43,679
the exposures you can rise above that

755
00:33:40,679 --> 00:33:48,019
and heal your emotions too and Rise

756
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:48,019
Above any kind of Soul injuries

757
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:54,960
a person with soul injury

758
00:33:52,679 --> 00:33:57,299
is vulnerable

759
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:59,880
if you ever hear a friend say I'm not

760
00:33:57,299 --> 00:34:02,640
ready for another relationship I'm still

761
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:05,039
hurting from my breakup

762
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:07,320
she's acknowledging that her soul needs

763
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:10,520
time to heal before she risks putting

764
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:10,520
herself out there again

765
00:34:12,419 --> 00:34:17,639
so many of us know when our soul is

766
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:19,980
vulnerable we know that we're

767
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:21,599
susceptible we know it's like whoa I

768
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:23,399
can't do that right now

769
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:26,040
I can't go through that again right now

770
00:34:23,399 --> 00:34:28,320
I I need to step back a little bit my

771
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:31,399
soul isn't feeling that strong my soul's

772
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,399
not feeling strong enough

773
00:34:34,919 --> 00:34:39,419
along the same lines if you ever observe

774
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:41,580
someone who's sick with symptoms or

775
00:34:39,419 --> 00:34:44,480
conditions and hasn't been able to find

776
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:47,580
answers you may see this person

777
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:49,440
hungrily pursuing spiritual learning in

778
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:51,000
any form

779
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:53,480
like religion

780
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:56,520
spiritual gurus self-help books

781
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:58,920
meditation Retreats breath work

782
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:02,760
it's likely because that person's soul

783
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:04,740
has been injured from all the trust lost

784
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:07,920
along the way

785
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:10,320
and she or he is instinctively searching

786
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:12,920
for ways to make the soul healthy and

787
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,920
complete again

788
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:18,780
when we fall ill with symptoms that

789
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:21,240
won't go away or that continue to come

790
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:24,500
and go we lose trust in our body and

791
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:24,500
others to help us

792
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:30,060
there are people who have been sick for

793
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:31,980
years who turn to soul-searching when

794
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:34,200
they can't find answers and that's

795
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:36,240
another thing too I I watched this for

796
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:39,000
decades

797
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:41,099
people are looking for Spiritual answers

798
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,820
because no one knows why they're sick

799
00:35:41,099 --> 00:35:43,820
physically

800
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:50,640
what was really popular back to like 30

801
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:53,040
years ago 25 years ago was because

802
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,780
nobody knew of course why anybody was

803
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:56,520
sick with chronic illness you go and

804
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:57,839
find somebody

805
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:59,700
and then

806
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:02,280
you try to find some kind of healer

807
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:03,900
takes to give you any kind of answer and

808
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:05,700
there's a good chance they'll tell you

809
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:08,579
it's because you had your head chopped

810
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:12,140
off in 1733

811
00:36:08,579 --> 00:36:12,140
in England somewhere

812
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:16,680
and that's why you're actually sick or

813
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:19,260
they'll say you drowned still say like

814
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:22,740
in the 1600s you were

815
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:25,859
you were deemed a witch in the 1600s

816
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:30,960
and you were put to death by drowning

817
00:36:25,859 --> 00:36:32,579
because nobody knew any answers right

818
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:34,740
I remember people would come to me and

819
00:36:32,579 --> 00:36:36,960
they'd be like well I bent every doctor

820
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:39,060
and now I've been to every

821
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:42,420
every psychic can heal where I can find

822
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:43,440
around the planet and I have some I have

823
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:46,079
some good

824
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:47,280
good leads one lead is I was drowned as

825
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:51,839
a witch

826
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:53,820
in 16 in the 1600s and because of that

827
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:56,400
that's why I'm sick and I have all these

828
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:59,359
problems and everything else and spirit

829
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,359
of compassion would say

830
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:04,640
no

831
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:04,640
that's not why the person's sick

832
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:10,140
person has real

833
00:37:07,859 --> 00:37:11,520
real reasons why they're sick and those

834
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:14,420
are the answers you find in the medical

835
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,420
medium books

836
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:25,680
sometimes soul-searching will bring

837
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:27,359
people closer to themselves many times

838
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:30,060
it will leave them feeling more lost

839
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:33,060
than ever did you ever go soul searching

840
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:36,180
and then you feel more lost than ever

841
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:38,040
did you ever try to find yourself but

842
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:39,839
yet you feel more lost

843
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:42,000
did that ever happen to you

844
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:44,780
where you're you're going to try to find

845
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,780
yourself right

846
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:50,839
and you think you're going to find

847
00:37:47,339 --> 00:37:50,839
yourself you're trying to find yourself

848
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:55,920
and then you're like I think I found

849
00:37:53,099 --> 00:37:57,839
myself I do I think I found myself you

850
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,820
guys yes everybody's saying yes but then

851
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:00,780
all of a sudden you feel more lost than

852
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:02,400
ever

853
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:05,780
and then you feel like you're down a

854
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,780
rabbit hole where it's worse

855
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:08,119
foreign

856
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:16,920
says I was probably burned at the stake

857
00:38:14,339 --> 00:38:19,260
I don't think so

858
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:22,760
that's terrible you weren't burned by it

859
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:22,760
you weren't burned at the stake

860
00:38:23,579 --> 00:38:28,680
many times it will leave someone feeling

861
00:38:26,339 --> 00:38:31,260
more lost than ever under the guise of

862
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:33,359
help you may have heard the false theory

863
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:35,700
that illness is just a cry for attention

864
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:37,560
did you guys ever hear that the false

865
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:40,320
theory that went around for decades at

866
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:42,060
Medical medium information had to

867
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:44,280
disprove

868
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:47,720
did you ever hear that where it's a cry

869
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:47,720
for help that's why you're sick

870
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:55,859
you were looking for attention

871
00:38:54,119 --> 00:38:57,780
did you ever hear that one where you

872
00:38:55,859 --> 00:39:00,839
were looking for attention

873
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:02,940
that's why you were sick yes

874
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:04,859
you've heard that

875
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:06,540
that's another one that has tortured

876
00:39:04,859 --> 00:39:10,619
people for years that medical medium

877
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:13,200
info had to disprove to help people

878
00:39:10,619 --> 00:39:15,480
they give them answers I can't tell you

879
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:17,040
how many times I've heard that like

880
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:19,140
you're just you're just want attention

881
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:22,859
that's that's why what you're doing

882
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:24,720
right that's what everybody's told

883
00:39:22,859 --> 00:39:27,079
that just breaks my heart when I even

884
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,079
hear that

885
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:31,800
you may have heard that when bad things

886
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:33,420
happen to us we cause them by thinking

887
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:35,820
the wrong thoughts did you guys hear

888
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:38,280
that one bad things are happening to you

889
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:40,320
you're sick because you caused it with

890
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:43,400
your by having the wrong thoughts did

891
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:43,400
you guys have that one too

892
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:50,940
like is that so yes I see that too like

893
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:51,960
by having the wrong thoughts that's why

894
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:54,599
you're sick

895
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:57,540
ajada says it's such a mind screw it so

896
00:39:54,599 --> 00:40:00,540
is such a mind screw it totally is yes

897
00:39:57,540 --> 00:40:02,460
you had that too where you you caused

898
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:04,740
your sickness by thinking the wrong

899
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:07,980
thoughts

900
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:11,640
see these were all made up things made

901
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:13,140
up theories here by men

902
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:15,300
my men

903
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:19,400
here on the planet and women here on the

904
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:19,400
planet it's made up theories

905
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:26,460
and spirit of compassion is not

906
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:28,619
from here so has Clarity on this because

907
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:32,700
I can't tell you how many times I've had

908
00:40:28,619 --> 00:40:35,579
to rewire someone because they were

909
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:37,260
positive they were sick because they had

910
00:40:35,579 --> 00:40:39,500
bad thoughts and that's why they were

911
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:39,500
sick

912
00:40:47,099 --> 00:40:50,339
I've said it before and I'll say it

913
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:53,040
again

914
00:40:50,339 --> 00:40:54,720
if you are ill or going through a trial

915
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:57,000
like a divorce

916
00:40:54,720 --> 00:41:00,980
or a loss

917
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,980
you did not manifest it

918
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:07,440
if you are going through a sickness you

919
00:41:05,099 --> 00:41:10,440
did not manifest it

920
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:13,079
if you are going through some type of

921
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:15,180
feeling of like being disconnected

922
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:17,940
feeling lost feeling hopeless and

923
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:20,040
depressed you did not manifest it

924
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:23,339
if you feel sadness that you can't

925
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:24,960
explain and you feel like you don't no

926
00:41:23,339 --> 00:41:27,180
one understands you and you can't

927
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:29,060
understand yourself you feel and you

928
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:31,820
feel like you lost all trust in yourself

929
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:33,960
you did not

930
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:37,640
manifest that

931
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:37,640
you did not attract it

932
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:45,780
it is not punishment or payback it's not

933
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:47,760
Karma

934
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:49,500
if you guys have struggled and you

935
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:51,720
suffered and something happened to you

936
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:54,480
along the way whatever you do don't

937
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:57,380
think it's karma paying you back

938
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:57,380
in this lifetime

939
00:41:57,540 --> 00:42:01,740
if a child is sick you mean to tell me

940
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:04,220
that child's karma is why that child is

941
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:04,220
suffering

942
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:11,119
Christina B says people all tell me that

943
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:11,119
so much

944
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:19,980
the one thing you'll find in the medical

945
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:22,320
medium information is about freeing the

946
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:24,660
brainwashing and freeing you up of the

947
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:27,480
brainwashing and mind control that has

948
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:28,980
been out there forever

949
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:30,960
and that mind control is in the

950
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:33,540
alternative arts and alternative healing

951
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:35,099
I'm so sorry to say I really am it

952
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:37,200
breaks my heart and kills me it's also

953
00:42:35,099 --> 00:42:40,020
in the conventional healing too in the

954
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:44,300
conventional world that mind control and

955
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:44,300
brain conditioning is unbelievable

956
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:55,380
there's a spiritual war out there

957
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:58,200
it really is and it just controls people

958
00:42:55,380 --> 00:43:00,119
purposely so those people can control

959
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:01,740
everybody else it's like it's

960
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:03,540
unbelievable

961
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:05,819
you did not attract it it's not

962
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:08,160
punishment or payback it's not your Bad

963
00:43:05,819 --> 00:43:10,260
Karma you have to know you're not sick

964
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:13,700
because of your karma whatever you do

965
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:13,700
you can't fall into that

966
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:22,380
so fernica Monica says then why some

967
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:24,240
then why are some of us so sick is it

968
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:27,119
destiny

969
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:30,420
go to the library

970
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:32,579
and try to get these books out for free

971
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:36,060
try not to even pay for them

972
00:43:32,579 --> 00:43:37,800
go to the library and get these books

973
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:40,020
vernica

974
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:43,880
find a library Wherever You Are

975
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:43,880
ask them for the medical medium book

976
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:55,800
you do not deserve to be sick or unhappy

977
00:43:52,859 --> 00:43:57,599
it's not your fault you didn't manifest

978
00:43:55,800 --> 00:44:01,020
it it's not your fault and it's not

979
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:03,060
Karma I can promise you that

980
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:05,400
you don't need to travel the world

981
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:08,460
trying to find yourself I've seen people

982
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:10,740
who have money travel the world

983
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:12,980
to find themselves and they're still

984
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:12,980
sick

985
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:18,359
Miranda mccola says Anthony can you

986
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:21,619
please clarify that God does not cause

987
00:44:18,359 --> 00:44:21,619
our suffering

988
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:27,599
I have a tremendous amount of

989
00:44:25,859 --> 00:44:30,720
information from spiritual compassion

990
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:32,040
about that very topic

991
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:34,440
and

992
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:37,440
I can tell you this

993
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:39,599
that what I've learned my whole life

994
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:42,599
since age four and listening and talking

995
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:45,420
to Spirit of compassion

996
00:44:42,599 --> 00:44:50,180
what I've learned from SOC is that God

997
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:50,180
does not cause our suffering on purpose

998
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:54,060
so

999
00:44:52,619 --> 00:44:56,460
Darkness

1000
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:59,640
here on the planet wants us to suffer

1001
00:44:56,460 --> 00:45:02,780
God is doing everything

1002
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:02,780
in God's power

1003
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:08,220
to stop that

1004
00:45:05,819 --> 00:45:10,140
I'll I'll do a whole I'll do a whole

1005
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:12,060
show on that and I'll actually

1006
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:15,000
I'll actually give you the details to

1007
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:16,980
that because it The Details Matter in

1008
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:19,880
that statement I just said the details

1009
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:19,880
matter in all of it

1010
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:27,180
Soul healing is about reclaiming Who You

1011
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:30,619
Are

1012
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:30,619
because you are already

1013
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:33,980
good enough

1014
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:37,740
who you are already means more than you

1015
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:41,099
know

1016
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:43,800
you are already good enough

1017
00:45:41,099 --> 00:45:47,119
it's just about healing now you are

1018
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:47,119
already good enough

1019
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:51,599
Lorraine L says the karma thing is so

1020
00:45:50,099 --> 00:45:54,420
overused

1021
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:57,119
you deserve to heal

1022
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:59,720
you deserve to be happy you deserve to

1023
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:59,720
feel whole

1024
00:46:23,099 --> 00:46:27,240
aw

1025
00:46:25,319 --> 00:46:30,119
is there a reason

1026
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:32,420
we meet certain people like a soul

1027
00:46:30,119 --> 00:46:32,420
connection

1028
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:41,119
well it all depends people meet certain

1029
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:41,119
people and it's like whoa that was

1030
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:45,839
the very hardest

1031
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:48,839
experiences I've ever had in my life

1032
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:50,880
because that certain person I met

1033
00:46:48,839 --> 00:46:51,900
you know and then you meet someone it's

1034
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:54,180
like

1035
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:56,160
someone actually understands me and it's

1036
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:59,160
like the door opens

1037
00:46:56,160 --> 00:47:00,960
and then you meet somebody and it's like

1038
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:04,140
how did this person get into my life

1039
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:06,480
this person is just toxic and dangerous

1040
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:08,819
in this person's in my life and I can go

1041
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:10,619
into details too on details too on how

1042
00:47:08,819 --> 00:47:13,200
that all happens these are all topics

1043
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:15,720
that I've I've fleshed out greatly with

1044
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:17,520
Spirit of compassion

1045
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:19,380
with tremendous amounts of details and

1046
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:21,180
information and

1047
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:24,500
so yeah

1048
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:24,500
it's it's interesting

1049
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:29,220
your heart serves as the compass for

1050
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:31,560
your actions

1051
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:34,500
guiding you to do the right thing when

1052
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:36,839
your soul becomes lost

1053
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:39,420
when our souls become lost we feel like

1054
00:47:36,839 --> 00:47:42,119
we disconnected we feel like our soul is

1055
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:45,420
busted up and broken our heart serves as

1056
00:47:42,119 --> 00:47:47,160
the compass for our actions it guides us

1057
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:49,319
to do the right thing when our soul

1058
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:51,960
becomes lost our heart matters in that

1059
00:47:49,319 --> 00:47:53,940
situation your heart is also a safety

1060
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:56,040
net that can compensate for soul

1061
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:58,680
injuries that means when we get broken

1062
00:47:56,040 --> 00:48:00,420
down so hard and we have really bad

1063
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:03,839
relationship or something happened in

1064
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:07,099
our life our heart

1065
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:07,099
stand strong

1066
00:48:07,319 --> 00:48:12,420
this means you can have a tattered soul

1067
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:14,520
and a warm loving heart

1068
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:17,460
I can't tell you how many people that

1069
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:20,040
I've met that have tattered they've been

1070
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:22,560
tattered along the way but their heart

1071
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:24,839
is warm and their heart is loving and

1072
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:27,540
their heart is caring I've been through

1073
00:48:24,839 --> 00:48:29,160
a lot in my life and I still care and I

1074
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:30,900
still want to help and I still care

1075
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:32,220
about people and love people and I know

1076
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:33,839
there's a whole bunch of people out

1077
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:37,319
there they've been through hell and back

1078
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:40,700
and they still have a heart that's warm

1079
00:48:37,319 --> 00:48:40,700
and loving and they care

1080
00:48:41,579 --> 00:48:47,099
when your soul suffers

1081
00:48:43,819 --> 00:48:51,359
losses a strong heart will get you

1082
00:48:47,099 --> 00:48:53,760
through with Selfless Love compassion

1083
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:57,920
and joy under the soul

1084
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:57,920
until your soul has managed to heal

1085
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:04,200
compassion is critical

1086
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:07,859
superficial love

1087
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:11,099
that's a matter of the Mind

1088
00:49:07,859 --> 00:49:13,339
self Selfless Love that comes from the

1089
00:49:11,099 --> 00:49:13,339
heart

1090
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:17,760
foreign

1091
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:19,319
you guys know about superficial love

1092
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:22,460
right

1093
00:49:19,319 --> 00:49:22,460
it's a superficial love

1094
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:25,099
love

1095
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:29,060
is not

1096
00:49:31,079 --> 00:49:35,900
absolute

1097
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:35,900
love is not

1098
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:44,119
everything

1099
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:44,119
unless compassion is attached to it

1100
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:47,700
that's why you can see somebody and

1101
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:49,500
they'll fall in love with someone

1102
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:51,599
and then they can fall out of love with

1103
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:54,180
someone like what was it

1104
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:57,000
was it just a change of heart a change

1105
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:58,680
of mind what was that how can you be so

1106
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,540
in love with someone

1107
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:03,020
so in love with them and then not love

1108
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:03,020
them anymore

1109
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:07,680
that means that love had no compassion

1110
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:09,839
in there

1111
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:12,119
it wasn't attached

1112
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:15,619
they were separated

1113
00:50:12,119 --> 00:50:15,619
if you have love

1114
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:21,859
for someone

1115
00:50:18,839 --> 00:50:21,859
and it's lost

1116
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:28,260
that means that the compassion is gone

1117
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:29,940
compassion is the glue to love love

1118
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:32,099
isn't enough

1119
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:33,720
you have to have compassion as the glue

1120
00:50:32,099 --> 00:50:36,420
for love

1121
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:38,940
or love won't stand a chance love won't

1122
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:40,740
hang in there love won't even Last Love

1123
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:42,300
Won't Be Strong Enough Love is just an

1124
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:45,000
empty word

1125
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:47,700
love is a totally empty word if

1126
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:50,520
compassion isn't intertwined or attached

1127
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:52,619
or somehow involved if you don't have

1128
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:55,500
compassion involved if compassion's not

1129
00:50:52,619 --> 00:50:57,740
part of love then love it's not strong

1130
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:57,740
enough

1131
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:02,819
because a tremendous amount of

1132
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:05,040
information in here the meditations that

1133
00:51:02,819 --> 00:51:06,660
are in here waves on the beach I love

1134
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:09,000
that one I want to do something with

1135
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:10,920
that with you guys sometime I'm going to

1136
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:13,980
read a little bit about emotional detox

1137
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:15,540
right here this book whoa surrounded by

1138
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:17,760
trees

1139
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:19,619
the healing tools in the medical medium

1140
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:23,180
books blow my mind because they come

1141
00:51:19,619 --> 00:51:23,180
from Spirit of compassion

1142
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:30,240
reading time with aw is the best

1143
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:33,720
right there on IG

1144
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:36,079
see Juliet says isn't everything just a

1145
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:36,079
lesson

1146
00:51:37,140 --> 00:51:41,460
we try to learn from it so we don't get

1147
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:44,460
burned by that stove again

1148
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:46,680
but no everything's not just a lesson

1149
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:48,839
unfortunately it's not

1150
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:51,780
it's like

1151
00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:54,680
you don't need your arm chopped off to

1152
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:54,680
teach you a lesson

1153
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:58,280
is that a lesson

1154
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:04,020
I know a lot of war vets

1155
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:07,380
that lost their legs

1156
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:10,380
um intertwined with a lot of vets

1157
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:12,859
right I have vets in my family the whole

1158
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:12,859
bit and

1159
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:18,720
losing both your legs is not there to

1160
00:52:17,339 --> 00:52:21,119
teach you a lesson

1161
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:24,140
we can we can certainly try to grow from

1162
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:24,140
it and learn from it

1163
00:52:25,859 --> 00:52:30,559
but it wasn't done on purpose to teach

1164
00:52:27,839 --> 00:52:30,559
us a lesson

1165
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:38,300
child abuse isn't there to teach a child

1166
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:38,300
a lesson

1167
00:52:40,619 --> 00:52:45,720
so yeah no things aren't there for a

1168
00:52:43,079 --> 00:52:47,579
lesson that's not how it works

1169
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:49,619
we can try to grow we can try to better

1170
00:52:47,579 --> 00:52:52,800
ourselves we can try to rise above it we

1171
00:52:49,619 --> 00:52:55,740
can try to use tools rise above it

1172
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:57,480
but it wasn't there to teach a child a

1173
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:59,760
lesson child abuse and it wasn't there

1174
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:03,319
for for uh

1175
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:03,319
a soldier who's

1176
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:06,839
trying to do something good it wasn't

1177
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:10,339
there

1178
00:53:06,839 --> 00:53:10,339
for the soldier to lose their legs

1179
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:15,680
being killed isn't a lesson either for

1180
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:15,680
us to learn

1181
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:19,559
abuse of any kind for someone isn't a

1182
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:21,119
lesson for us to learn we're not that's

1183
00:53:19,559 --> 00:53:24,020
not a lesson we're not supposed to learn

1184
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:24,020
that as a lesson

1185
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:26,839
but it happens

1186
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:32,280
you guys I'm reading if you just got

1187
00:53:30,599 --> 00:53:34,040
here reading out a medical meme do you

1188
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:37,559
have the revised and Expanded Edition

1189
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:40,819
because one thing I can say and I'm I

1190
00:53:37,559 --> 00:53:40,819
can't help it I got to say it again

1191
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:45,119
because it's been said like a thousand

1192
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:46,500
times out there over the years to try to

1193
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:48,420
discredit

1194
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:50,760
the information

1195
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:52,800
when I hear someone say out there like

1196
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:55,380
an influence or something say that you

1197
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:58,140
can't get any emotional tools

1198
00:53:55,380 --> 00:54:00,359
or emotional healing or emotional detox

1199
00:53:58,140 --> 00:54:02,460
info for medical medium when the books

1200
00:54:00,359 --> 00:54:04,260
are filled with them it just tells me

1201
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:06,300
that that influencer never read the

1202
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:08,040
books

1203
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:10,020
perfectly clear that they haven't read

1204
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:12,059
the books

1205
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:13,380
yeah

1206
00:54:12,059 --> 00:54:17,880
I'm going to read a little bit into

1207
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:22,020
emotional detox right here lena111

1208
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:23,099
hi aw why do I feel I have no worth no

1209
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:25,859
value

1210
00:54:23,099 --> 00:54:26,700
but there is a drive in me that makes me

1211
00:54:25,859 --> 00:54:30,839
do

1212
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:32,940
that makes me try day in and day out to

1213
00:54:30,839 --> 00:54:36,240
take care of myself maybe my soul is

1214
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:39,500
hurt but my will is strong your free

00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:39,500
will is extremely strong

1216
00:54:50,339 --> 00:54:55,559
your spirit is strong which is your will

1217
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:57,540
have a really strong Spirit that's

1218
00:54:55,559 --> 00:54:59,040
different than your soul your soul can

1219
00:54:57,540 --> 00:55:01,140
feel beaten down and it can feel

1220
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:03,839
weakened

1221
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:07,460

1222
00:55:03,839 --> 00:55:07,460
will get stronger too and heal

1223
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:13,920
Lorraine now says people try to

1224
00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:15,420
rationalize bad stuff as it being a

1225
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:18,380
lesson

1226
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:18,380
I know they do

1227
00:55:24,839 --> 00:55:29,460
and those are usually the people those

1228
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:31,980
are usually the people

1229
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:33,359
who try to deny that Darkness exists you

1230
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:35,280
know they're like there is no Darkness

1231
00:55:33,359 --> 00:55:37,940
there is no bad in the world there's no

1232
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:37,940
bad in the world

1233
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:44,780
it's like what bubble are you in because

1234
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:47,160
there's plenty of bad in the world

1235
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:49,559
they're not it's not all lessons well

1236
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:51,540
it's all lessons and even people don't

1237
00:55:49,559 --> 00:55:54,540
mean to be bad that do terrible things

1238
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:56,880
out there it's really a Learning lesson

1239
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:58,319
and we're all just it's all we're all

1240
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:00,059
just learning there's no evil in the

1241
00:55:58,319 --> 00:56:03,559
world there's no darkness in the world

1242
00:56:00,059 --> 00:56:03,559
there's only lessons in the world

1243
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:10,380
foreign

1244
00:56:07,319 --> 00:56:13,260
totally inaccurate emotional detox

1245
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:17,040
there's a significant emotional aspect

1246
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:19,559
recovering from any injury or ailment

1247
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:22,079
so there's a significant emotional

1248
00:56:19,559 --> 00:56:24,359
aspect to recovering from any kind of

1249
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:26,880
sickness especially mystery illness

1250
00:56:24,359 --> 00:56:30,540
especially mystery illness where 10

1251
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:33,680
doctors 20 doctors no answers can't heal

1252
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:33,680
Bend through hell and back

1253
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:40,800
as your body cleanses itself of toxins

1254
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:43,800
and viruses and pathogens

1255
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:47,099
you may find that emotional detox occurs

1256
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:49,020
too when you are healing and you are

1257
00:56:47,099 --> 00:56:51,300
cleaning up those bugs and cleaning up

1258
00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:54,300
those toxins inside the body

1259
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:54,300
emotions

1260
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:59,359
and emotional detox occurs as well

1261
00:56:57,780 --> 00:57:01,740
there's many people where they're

1262
00:56:59,359 --> 00:57:03,780
simultaneously that emotional detox

1263
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:06,119
happening

1264
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:08,579
for example if you suffered with chronic

1265
00:57:06,119 --> 00:57:10,980
fatigue syndrome since college and have

1266
00:57:08,579 --> 00:57:13,260
learned through this book that a virus

1267
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:15,960
was behind your condition

1268
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:18,059
you might feel initial relief and even

1269
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:19,619
Elation as you follow the chapter's

1270
00:57:18,059 --> 00:57:21,960
guidelines to restore yourself I can't

1271
00:57:19,619 --> 00:57:24,180
tell you how many people I heard this

1272
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:26,640
over and over again for years now it's

1273
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:30,000
almost a decade with this book

1274
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:32,579
and oh my God I can't believe I know the

1275
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:34,920
answer to why I'm sick I feel like I can

1276
00:57:32,579 --> 00:57:37,079
heal emotionally now I've been

1277
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:38,819
emotionally tortured because I have

1278
00:57:37,079 --> 00:57:41,940
fatigue and brain fog and I can't

1279
00:57:38,819 --> 00:57:43,980
function and I can't feed myself and

1280
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:45,960
take care of myself and work

1281
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:48,540
and everybody thinks I'm crazy and

1282
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:50,400
everybody thinks I'm lazy and that I'm

1283
00:57:48,540 --> 00:57:52,260
making this up and I've been to so many

1284
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:55,079
doctors including this new Lyme doctor

1285
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:57,059
now and this other specialist

1286
00:57:55,079 --> 00:57:59,280
I can't tell you how many people found

1287
00:57:57,059 --> 00:58:01,380
this book and were like oh my God I am

1288
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:04,859
finding peace in my heart peace in my

1289
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:07,500
soul to have an answer to why I'm sick

1290
00:58:04,859 --> 00:58:10,099
that alone is unbelievable when you

1291
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:10,099
think about it

1292
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:16,859

00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:46,500
behind your sickness your emotions start

00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:48,359
to Bubble Up

1305
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:50,760
nobody knew a virus released a

1306
00:58:48,359 --> 00:58:54,180
neurotoxin

1307
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:57,059

1309
00:58:57,059 --> 00:59:01,440
can't help it I have to say it because

1310
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:03,240
I'm not reading info that's out there

like in the sense where it was

1312
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:06,440
discovered here

1315
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:17,339
people who told you your illness was

00:59:14,819 --> 00:59:20,760
psychosomatic did anybody tell you that

has happened to so many people right

1333
00:59:59,460 --> 01:00:05,160
it's psychosomatic and it's it's like

1334
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:08,579
that's what you're being told but it's

1335
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:11,400
not that it's not

1336
01:00:08,579 --> 01:00:13,559
let's see here's a comment right here

1337
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:16,559
sometimes I think when you've been

1338
01:00:13,559 --> 01:00:19,079
through tough times and come back and

1339
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:22,500
Rise From the Ashes your heart becomes

1340
01:00:19,079 --> 01:00:25,040
bigger and same with your compassion

1341
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:25,040
thank you

1342
01:00:29,099 --> 01:00:32,119
so here we go

1343
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:39,119
when you've had

1344
01:00:37,740 --> 01:00:40,619
when you've had all these different

1345
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:43,559
trials

1346
01:00:40,619 --> 01:00:46,319
you've been tested

1347
01:00:43,559 --> 01:00:48,240
you've been pushed to the edge

1348
01:00:46,319 --> 01:00:50,220
you've had so many symptoms in so many

1349
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:52,260
conditions

1350
01:00:50,220 --> 01:00:54,900
you've been to every doctor and family

1351
01:00:52,260 --> 01:00:58,020
and friends they don't even really trust

1352
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:59,760
any more that you're even legit as far

1353
01:00:58,020 --> 01:01:02,339
as your symptoms where hey you're

1354
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:04,200
psychosomatic and you're a hypochondriac

1355
01:01:02,339 --> 01:01:06,720
and this probably isn't even real

1356
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:09,000
anymore and you look good too like you

1357
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:11,160
look fine you fine you don't look like

1358
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:14,420
you're sick you look okay you look

1359
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:14,420
normal hey you look good today

1360
01:01:14,780 --> 01:01:19,859
it hits it hits us really hard when that

1361
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:22,020
happens so we're just like

1362
01:01:19,859 --> 01:01:23,880
especially if we're really suffering and

1363
01:01:22,020 --> 01:01:25,619
struggling and it's getting worse and

1364
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:29,819
that's a whole nother level of like oh

1365
01:01:25,619 --> 01:01:32,099
my God no one understands me

1366
01:01:29,819 --> 01:01:34,500
and then you start healing you find the

1367
01:01:32,099 --> 01:01:39,000
answers you rise out of the ashes

1368
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:40,260
whoa every single one of those remarks

1369
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:42,540
that you have gone through and that

1370
01:01:40,260 --> 01:01:45,420
hardship you've gone through and people

1371
01:01:42,540 --> 01:01:49,640
not people judging you and doubting you

1372
01:01:45,420 --> 01:01:49,640
is like a building block

1373
01:01:49,980 --> 01:01:55,500
you're building your church you're

1374
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:58,880
building your Sanctuary you're building

1375
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:58,880
your foundation

1376
01:02:01,700 --> 01:02:07,799
says so we

1377
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:10,680
so do we need to extra protect our

1378
01:02:07,799 --> 01:02:12,599
adrenals when this happens or is it just

1379
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:16,200
part of the detox process and I'm good

1380
01:02:12,599 --> 01:02:19,520
and if if a crying spell happens

1381
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:19,520
the medical medium information

1382
01:02:21,020 --> 01:02:28,740
is adrenal protective

1383
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:32,460
if you are cleansing and detoxing

1384
01:02:28,740 --> 01:02:34,200
with a medical medium protocol

1385
01:02:32,460 --> 01:02:37,880
it's protecting your adrenals because

1386
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:37,880
it's not stopping you from eating

1387
01:02:38,579 --> 01:02:42,420
if you're going through a hardship

1388
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:43,859
emotionally and you're intermittent

1389
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:46,020
fasting your adrenals are not being

1390
01:02:43,859 --> 01:02:47,940
protected

1391
01:02:46,020 --> 01:02:50,160
but medical medium information isn't

1392
01:02:47,940 --> 01:02:52,140
intermittent fasting

1393
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:54,780
if you're doing

1394
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:56,400
like a 369 or you're doing a 28 day

1395
01:02:54,780 --> 01:02:57,720
cleanse or you're doing brain shot

1396
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:58,920
therapies or whatever it is that you're

1397
01:02:57,720 --> 01:03:02,220
doing or

1398
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:04,559
the monocleanse or anything you're

1399
01:03:02,220 --> 01:03:07,260
actually getting fuel to protect your

1400
01:03:04,559 --> 01:03:09,119
adrenals

1401
01:03:07,260 --> 01:03:10,740
and that's the problem so many people in

1402
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:12,839
e-better diets aren't even protecting

1403
01:03:10,740 --> 01:03:16,880
their adrenals

1404
01:03:12,839 --> 01:03:16,880
and so yeah of course it's okay to cry

1405
01:03:19,859 --> 01:03:26,099
it's just it's just reliving old trauma

1406
01:03:23,579 --> 01:03:27,780
is difficult like if

1407
01:03:26,099 --> 01:03:30,599
if you

1408
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:33,119
if you feel you need to relive old

1409
01:03:30,599 --> 01:03:35,640
trauma

1410
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:36,480
I'm not judging you I support you but if

1411
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:40,619
you

1412
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:42,720
but if you're reliving old trauma

1413
01:03:40,619 --> 01:03:46,700
or reliving

1414
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:46,700
real fresh trauma

1415
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:52,020
it's important to fortify

1416
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:53,819
with for example like the medical meme

1417
01:03:52,020 --> 01:03:56,280
information there's so much adrenal

1418
01:03:53,819 --> 01:03:59,160
support in the books it's

1419
01:03:56,280 --> 01:04:02,359
the books are partially built on

1420
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:02,359
supporting the adrenals

1421
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:07,579
the information from above is so adrenal

1422
01:04:05,099 --> 01:04:07,579
protective

1423
01:04:09,420 --> 01:04:12,960
when you're really sick with chronic

1424
01:04:11,099 --> 01:04:16,319
illness and you're feeling very

1425
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:19,280
vulnerable it's it's not the right time

1426
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:22,559
to revisit some really really really

1427
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:24,900
deep-seated hurtful wounds I will say

1428
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:26,280
this when people go to therapists and I

1429
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:28,020
support people going to therapist of

1430
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:29,760
course but you know and everything but

1431
01:04:28,020 --> 01:04:32,099
the point is when they go to therapists

1432
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:35,160
and they're very sick and nobody knows

1433
01:04:32,099 --> 01:04:37,440
why they're sick with lupus and fibro

1434
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:39,059
and Ms and and so many different

1435
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:40,200
conditions that could list 100 of them

1436
01:04:39,059 --> 01:04:42,240
right

1437
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:44,400
and they're very vulnerable and their

1438
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:48,079
immune systems are really really

1439
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:50,420
sensitive and low and they're reliving

1440
01:04:48,079 --> 01:04:54,599
serious serious

1441
01:04:50,420 --> 01:04:56,880
emotional turmoil and Trauma

1442
01:04:54,599 --> 01:04:58,740
it's very difficult because the person's

1443
01:04:56,880 --> 01:05:01,559
already struggling and really really

1444
01:04:58,740 --> 01:05:04,200
sick so it's best to get the physical

1445
01:05:01,559 --> 01:05:08,480
body stronger so you can eventually then

1446
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:08,480
tackle some of that old trauma

1447
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:17,700
I think where people get it wrong a lot

1448
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:19,380
or they get get it wrong right

1449
01:05:17,700 --> 01:05:22,440
because they think that they need to

1450
01:05:19,380 --> 01:05:25,260
like say they're say they're doing

1451
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:27,780
like a low-fat protocol where they're

1452
01:05:25,260 --> 01:05:29,400
keeping the fats really low

1453
01:05:27,780 --> 01:05:31,799
and

1454
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:33,359
they think well I better eat more fat to

1455
01:05:31,799 --> 01:05:35,760
withhold

1456
01:05:33,359 --> 01:05:37,920
you know to protect my adrenals

1457
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:39,299
but it doesn't work that way the more

1458
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:41,520
fat you eat

1459
01:05:39,299 --> 01:05:42,839
the more you stress the adrenals out the

1460
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:44,339
one thing I think where people don't

1461
01:05:42,839 --> 01:05:47,180
understand about medical medium

1462
01:05:44,339 --> 01:05:51,780
information is that when you're doing

1463
01:05:47,180 --> 01:05:54,000
like the 28 day cleanse the 369s and the

1464
01:05:51,780 --> 01:05:55,980
mono cleanses and the morning cleanses

1465
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:58,500
and you're doing all the different

1466
01:05:55,980 --> 01:06:00,960
right you're doing all the different

1467
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:03,119
food protocols

1468
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:04,680
what people don't realize is that your

1469
01:06:03,119 --> 01:06:08,160
adrenals start building up and getting

1470
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:10,440
stronger and stronger and stronger

1471
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:14,700
so the one thing about Spirit of

1472
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:17,040
compassions information for the foods

1473
01:06:14,700 --> 01:06:20,420
and the food protocols with medical

1474
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:24,000
medium is that it builds the adrenals

1475
01:06:20,420 --> 01:06:26,640
stronger and stronger without wearing

1476
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:29,640
them down it's part of how people get

1477
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:32,520
their lives back and then

1478
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:34,200
and then as they're healing their

1479
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:36,900
adrenals

1480
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:40,140
and they bring in a shift in their diet

1481
01:06:36,900 --> 01:06:43,440
like they start eating all this fun food

1482
01:06:40,140 --> 01:06:44,400
and really heavy vegan food lots of fats

1483
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:45,900
or whatever it is and they start

1484
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:48,180
bringing all that in they feel better

1485
01:06:45,900 --> 01:06:50,460
for a moment because they made their

1486
01:06:48,180 --> 01:06:52,559
adrenals so strong

1487
01:06:50,460 --> 01:06:54,240
that the minute they started eating all

1488
01:06:52,559 --> 01:06:55,980
these like say they brought in all these

1489
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:57,359
burritos and all this was just fun but

1490
01:06:55,980 --> 01:06:59,400
they brought in all this fat and they

1491
01:06:57,359 --> 01:07:01,920
brought in all this and the bagels and

1492
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:03,240
they brought in the vegan pizza and they

1493
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:05,160
brought all that in

1494
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:07,920
and they're like oh my God I can eat

1495
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:10,200
what I want and I'm feeling better from

1496
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:13,680
it what they're feeling is the strength

1497
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:16,200
of the adrenals that they restored on

1498
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:18,119
the medical medium protocols so what the

1499
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:20,819
medical medium protocols do

1500
01:07:18,119 --> 01:07:22,859
is they restore and strengthen adrenals

1501
01:07:20,819 --> 01:07:25,200
to such a point that the minute you

1502
01:07:22,859 --> 01:07:28,260
start to use your adrenaline you

1503
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:30,900
self-medicate you feel like

1504
01:07:28,260 --> 01:07:33,900
like oh my God I feel incredible you

1505
01:07:30,900 --> 01:07:36,660
feel the hit from the adrenaline because

1506
01:07:33,900 --> 01:07:38,760
you brought your adrenals back so people

1507
01:07:36,660 --> 01:07:41,760
come to Medical medium information with

1508
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:43,380
weak adrenals they come to mm info with

1509
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:45,839
weakened broken down adrenals from

1510
01:07:43,380 --> 01:07:48,000
intermittent fasting from Bad eat better

1511
01:07:45,839 --> 01:07:50,819
diets from dysfunctional eat better

1512
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:52,680
diets from keto diets from carnivore

1513
01:07:50,819 --> 01:07:55,440
diets they come to Medical medium

1514
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:58,440
information and diet and medical medium

1515
01:07:55,440 --> 01:08:02,339
food protocols they come here with

1516
01:07:58,440 --> 01:08:04,260
broken adrenals and then they they start

1517
01:08:02,339 --> 01:08:07,380
to restore them with the celery juice

1518
01:08:04,260 --> 01:08:10,260
and the eating every couple of hours and

1519
01:08:07,380 --> 01:08:12,720
the fruits and the leafy greens and they

1520
01:08:10,260 --> 01:08:14,760
start to restore their adrenals and

1521
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:17,520
after a year they finally got their

1522
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:20,040
adrenals so much stronger

1523
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:21,540
that all of a sudden they feel like they

1524
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:23,759
could eat other things so they start

1525
01:08:21,540 --> 01:08:25,380
bringing in other stuff and more fat and

1526
01:08:23,759 --> 01:08:27,359
higher fat and more things and the

1527
01:08:25,380 --> 01:08:32,160
minute they start bringing all that in

1528
01:08:27,359 --> 01:08:35,779
it proves itself the adrenals are so

1529
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:38,480
strong at that point that they release

1530
01:08:35,779 --> 01:08:41,219
self-medication they release

1531
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:45,199
adrenaline hits and then all of a sudden

1532
01:08:41,219 --> 01:08:45,199
you feel euphoric like wait a minute

1533
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:51,480
I feel better now that I'm eating three

1534
01:08:48,420 --> 01:08:54,120
slices of vegan pizza and I'm eating two

1535
01:08:51,480 --> 01:08:56,400
avocados every day and I'm eating

1536
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:57,839
whatever I feel better and I'm eating

1537
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:59,880
more chicken or something or whatever

1538
01:08:57,839 --> 01:09:02,160
they're doing or chocolate

1539
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:03,900
and they're like wait a minute I feel

1540
01:09:02,160 --> 01:09:05,100
better and then all of a sudden someone

1541
01:09:03,900 --> 01:09:06,960
will put something in their head and go

1542
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:09,600
like oh you were orthorexic before

1543
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:11,759
meanwhile what you were restoring your

1544
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:14,580
adrenals you were bringing yourself back

1545
01:09:11,759 --> 01:09:16,739
you were you were blowing lowering your

1546
01:09:14,580 --> 01:09:18,660
inflammation

1547
01:09:16,739 --> 01:09:21,299
and then

1548
01:09:18,660 --> 01:09:23,339
even if you weren't totally fully hail

1549
01:09:21,299 --> 01:09:25,620
healed yet and you still had some

1550
01:09:23,339 --> 01:09:27,179
problems like a knee problem that

1551
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:29,219
wouldn't quite get to where it needed to

1552
01:09:27,179 --> 01:09:31,199
go or an ankle problem that wasn't quite

1553
01:09:29,219 --> 01:09:34,319
there the minute you started bringing in

1554
01:09:31,199 --> 01:09:37,620
all that fat or bringing in other Foods

1555
01:09:34,319 --> 01:09:40,500
your adrenals were so strong from doing

1556
01:09:37,620 --> 01:09:43,739
mm stuff even if you're just doing it on

1557
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:45,540
and off it made them so strong that the

1558
01:09:43,739 --> 01:09:48,179
minute you brought in some fat your

1559
01:09:45,540 --> 01:09:50,179
adrenals were like and just released all

1560
01:09:48,179 --> 01:09:52,140
this adrenaline and it became

1561
01:09:50,179 --> 01:09:53,819
self-medication where all of a sudden

1562
01:09:52,140 --> 01:09:55,199
you're just like whoa it was like bee

1563
01:09:53,819 --> 01:09:58,199
sting therapy

1564
01:09:55,199 --> 01:10:00,660
but the difference is you you know your

1565
01:09:58,199 --> 01:10:03,540
adrenals just got so strong and healthy

1566
01:10:00,660 --> 01:10:05,760
that you you can afford to just blow out

1567
01:10:03,540 --> 01:10:07,860
a bunch of adrenaline that's that's

1568
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:09,540
what's incredible about the mm info I

1569
01:10:07,860 --> 01:10:11,640
know this is really

1570
01:10:09,540 --> 01:10:13,920
detailed information there's so much

1571
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:15,660
more I can say about it but I think

1572
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:17,400
that's a mistake people make they don't

1573
01:10:15,660 --> 01:10:20,699
realize it like for instance I remember

1574
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:22,560
a couple years ago

1575
01:10:20,699 --> 01:10:24,239
right

1576
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:26,040
um someone

1577
01:10:24,239 --> 01:10:29,460
I remember this one and I see it a lot

1578
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:31,679
right but someone restored

1579
01:10:29,460 --> 01:10:33,780
their health

1580
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:35,940
by doing the mono eating the medical

1581
01:10:33,780 --> 01:10:37,679
media monocleens

1582
01:10:35,940 --> 01:10:39,360
and they got the medical media

1583
01:10:37,679 --> 01:10:41,400
monocleanse from the cleanse the heel

1584
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:43,500
book right I don't know I think I have

1585
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:44,820
it somewhere the Clinton Hill book and

1586
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:46,560
the restored

1587
01:10:44,820 --> 01:10:49,199
their

1588
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:50,699
their health

1589
01:10:49,199 --> 01:10:52,560
but they did it because they were doing

1590
01:10:50,699 --> 01:10:54,780
the medical media monocleanse and they

1591
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:56,760
restored their adrenals and they've got

1592
01:10:54,780 --> 01:10:59,159
their inflammation down and they lowered

1593
01:10:56,760 --> 01:11:01,380
their viral load and then

1594
01:10:59,159 --> 01:11:04,380
they

1595
01:11:01,380 --> 01:11:06,179
said hey I'm gonna go and just eat

1596
01:11:04,380 --> 01:11:07,679
whatever but good vegan food but I'm

1597
01:11:06,179 --> 01:11:09,420
gonna go eat a whole bunch of good vegan

1598
01:11:07,679 --> 01:11:10,860
food and they went and they had all this

1599
01:11:09,420 --> 01:11:12,420
vegan food and they were eating all

1600
01:11:10,860 --> 01:11:14,100
kinds of dishes and delights and going

1601
01:11:12,420 --> 01:11:17,179
out to dinner

1602
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:20,280
and they felt great like better because

1603
01:11:17,179 --> 01:11:22,140
they restored their adrenals for a

1604
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:24,659
couple of years

1605
01:11:22,140 --> 01:11:28,699
and then they started using their

1606
01:11:24,659 --> 01:11:28,699
adrenaline and man did it feel good

1607
01:11:29,580 --> 01:11:33,840
that's how it works cold White Springs

1608
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:36,719
says fat triggers adrenals yes fat

1609
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:38,340
triggers adrenaline correct because the

1610
01:11:36,719 --> 01:11:42,120
more fat you put into your bloodstream

1611
01:11:38,340 --> 01:11:44,640
your hearts your heart struggles

1612
01:11:42,120 --> 01:11:46,560
so

1613
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:48,300
you know so what happens is the more fat

1614
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:50,340
that's why vegans get sick they're

1615
01:11:48,300 --> 01:11:52,560
eating nut Butters just so much coconut

1616
01:11:50,340 --> 01:11:54,960
oil and and almond butter and they're

1617
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:56,580
eating so much it's okay to have some of

1618
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:58,260
that if if you want to have some but

1619
01:11:56,580 --> 01:12:02,280
what happens is that in when people

1620
01:11:58,260 --> 01:12:04,800
become vegan they end up eating so much

1621
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:07,380
vegan cheese which is pure this is pure

1622
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:09,840
fat they end up eating vegan cheese and

1623
01:12:07,380 --> 01:12:12,179
coconut oil and they end up eating a lot

1624
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:14,219
of it and cocoa butter coconut I mean

1625
01:12:12,179 --> 01:12:17,159
sorry cacao butter right they end up

1626
01:12:14,219 --> 01:12:18,659
eating cacao and chocolate more of it so

1627
01:12:17,159 --> 01:12:21,060
when you're vegan you're like oh I can

1628
01:12:18,659 --> 01:12:23,040
eat I'm not going to eat meat or chicken

1629
01:12:21,060 --> 01:12:25,380
I'm not gonna have fish I'm vegan now

1630
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:26,640
but I can have more chocolate incredible

1631
01:12:25,380 --> 01:12:28,320
and chocolate's supposed to be good for

1632
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:30,540
me I'll have more chocolate so they'll

1633
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:33,300
do that and then they'll do

1634
01:12:30,540 --> 01:12:35,040
then they'll do like more coconut oil

1635
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:36,900
and they're putting like coconut oil on

1636
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:38,580
everything and they're using olive oil

1637
01:12:36,900 --> 01:12:40,260
on everything and then not only are they

1638
01:12:38,580 --> 01:12:42,300
doing olive oil they're eating more

1639
01:12:40,260 --> 01:12:43,320
avocados than they ever did before and

1640
01:12:42,300 --> 01:12:44,699
then

1641
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:46,560
they were feeling a little better from

1642
01:12:44,699 --> 01:12:48,300
the start because they got off of their

1643
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:50,880
their processed food diet or whatever

1644
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:53,040
they're doing and then they get sicker

1645
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:55,260
and now they're back on eggs

1646
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:56,880
they're vegans that go back on eggs and

1647
01:12:55,260 --> 01:12:59,060
every like they're they're not vegan

1648
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:59,060

01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:39,600
like and that high is adrenaline surging

1666
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:42,179
through your bloodstream and that stuff

1667
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:44,820
can medicate you people don't realize it

1668
01:13:42,179 --> 01:13:46,820
but our adrenaline could medicate us

1669
01:13:44,820 --> 01:13:50,699
like our adrenals are just like

1670
01:13:46,820 --> 01:13:53,219
squeezing out that gasoline that that

1671
01:13:50,699 --> 01:13:55,640
fuel

1672
01:13:53,219 --> 01:14:00,739
the kerosene and it's like and it's it's

1673
01:13:55,640 --> 01:14:00,739
igniting and we are on adrenaline

1674
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:05,040
I don't know how we got into an adrenal

1675
01:14:02,940 --> 01:14:08,580
talk adrenaline to oh a question to

1676
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:10,860
happen Renata Renata

1677
01:14:08,580 --> 01:14:13,440
so to clarify here's your question right

1678
01:14:10,860 --> 01:14:16,140
you're on YouTube so to clarify if we

1679
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:18,480
need to cry should we go ahead and do it

1680
01:14:16,140 --> 01:14:20,400
without worrying about our adrenals or

1681
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:22,500
possible adrenaline surges

1682
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:24,000
that could feed viruses if you have to

1683
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:25,620
cry if you feel like you need to cry you

1684
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:27,060
can cry I mean

1685
01:14:25,620 --> 01:14:28,620
you're taking care of yourself you're

1686
01:14:27,060 --> 01:14:30,480
doing you're doing the medical mean

1687
01:14:28,620 --> 01:14:32,460
protocols you're you're strengthening

1688
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:34,140
your adrenals like you do and all that

1689
01:14:32,460 --> 01:14:37,020
you do that you've done throughout the

1690
01:14:34,140 --> 01:14:39,000
process right all of it

1691
01:14:37,020 --> 01:14:41,900
if you have to let out some tears let

1692
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,900
out some tears

1693
01:14:49,140 --> 01:14:51,320
foreign

1694
01:14:54,840 --> 01:15:00,620
so I want to read about this little part

1695
01:14:56,880 --> 01:15:00,620
right here which is really powerful too

1696
01:15:00,840 --> 01:15:03,260
so

1697
01:15:03,420 --> 01:15:09,179
as our cells release those physical

1698
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:11,280
toxins such as neurotoxins and

1699
01:15:09,179 --> 01:15:13,100
dermatoxins produced by the very viruses

1700
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:16,679
behind your symptoms and conditions

1701
01:15:13,100 --> 01:15:19,980
emotions bubble up

1702
01:15:16,679 --> 01:15:22,020
you may find yourself angry with the

1703
01:15:19,980 --> 01:15:23,940
people who told you your illness was

1704
01:15:22,020 --> 01:15:25,739
psychosomatic we talked about that and

1705
01:15:23,940 --> 01:15:30,440
you may grieve for the years you lost

1706
01:15:25,739 --> 01:15:30,440
about being unwell so many people grieve

1707
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:37,080
so fernica Monica says self-medicated

1708
01:15:33,540 --> 01:15:40,140
adrenaline is then good

1709
01:15:37,080 --> 01:15:43,020
using too much of it's not good it's

1710
01:15:40,140 --> 01:15:44,940
like you restored your adrenals that's

1711
01:15:43,020 --> 01:15:47,159
what medical mean information is always

1712
01:15:44,940 --> 01:15:49,440
done for people going back decades it

1713
01:15:47,159 --> 01:15:51,179
restores their adrenals makes them

1714
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:54,540
really strong

1715
01:15:51,179 --> 01:15:56,159
and then we self-medicate all over again

1716
01:15:54,540 --> 01:15:58,080
like I can't tell you how many times

1717
01:15:56,159 --> 01:16:00,540
like you got to read the brain saver

1718
01:15:58,080 --> 01:16:03,739
books you guys uh the eating disorder

1719
01:16:00,540 --> 01:16:06,420
chapter alone is like

1720
01:16:03,739 --> 01:16:07,920
mind-blowing right and it talks about

1721
01:16:06,420 --> 01:16:09,540
adrenaline and stuff like that right

1722
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:13,560
I've helped so many people that have had

1723
01:16:09,540 --> 01:16:15,600
like bulimia right and they were just on

1724
01:16:13,560 --> 01:16:17,960
adrenaline highs that's what bulimia is

1725
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:20,760
it's an adrenaline High

1726
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:22,920
and um

1727
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:24,780
and they had to restore using so many

1728
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:27,960
people that were bulimic had to use

1729
01:16:24,780 --> 01:16:30,659
medical medium info and to restore their

1730
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:33,540
adrenals again

1731
01:16:30,659 --> 01:16:36,179
and then if they ever go back to bulimia

1732
01:16:33,540 --> 01:16:38,640
like a trigger happens right a severe

1733
01:16:36,179 --> 01:16:41,460
emotional abuse and they go back to

1734
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:44,580
bulimia

1735
01:16:41,460 --> 01:16:47,340
it's euphoric because they restored

1736
01:16:44,580 --> 01:16:48,900
their adrenals again what happens is

1737
01:16:47,340 --> 01:16:51,600
there's this thing what happens is when

1738
01:16:48,900 --> 01:16:53,820
your bulimic you run out of adrenaline

1739
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:55,679
as the years go by because you're using

1740
01:16:53,820 --> 01:16:58,500
it to propel and vomit the food up right

1741
01:16:55,679 --> 01:17:00,600
but what's happening is that then you

1742
01:16:58,500 --> 01:17:04,199
don't get high anymore

1743
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:06,719
but when you restore your adrenals

1744
01:17:04,199 --> 01:17:09,480
it's like it's Euphoria when you restore

1745
01:17:06,719 --> 01:17:14,100
your adrenals and you eat whatever you

1746
01:17:09,480 --> 01:17:16,140
want it's euphoric because your adrenals

1747
01:17:14,100 --> 01:17:18,120
got so strong they're

1748
01:17:16,140 --> 01:17:20,460
peeing out adrenaline and it's

1749
01:17:18,120 --> 01:17:23,280
self-medication so you so yeah you got

1750
01:17:20,460 --> 01:17:27,120
to be careful like you don't like overdo

1751
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:29,880
your your well you actually created a

1752
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:31,980
Wellspring of adrenaline to protect you

1753
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:34,940
to have you live longer you don't want

1754
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:34,940
to blow it all out

1755
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:41,820
how his health said just made this live

1756
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:43,739
we talked about a lot of things you got

1757
01:17:41,820 --> 01:17:45,659
to watch from the beginning and I think

1758
01:17:43,739 --> 01:17:47,699
right isn't that funny like it's like

1759
01:17:45,659 --> 01:17:50,360
but I'm glad you're here thank you Holly

1760
01:17:47,699 --> 01:17:50,360
for being here

1761
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:54,960
yeah think about that I'm listening to

1762
01:17:53,580 --> 01:17:56,640
Spirit of compassion right here so just

1763
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:58,620
bear with me I'll just

1764
01:17:56,640 --> 01:18:01,640
I'm mumbling a little bit and listening

1765
01:17:58,620 --> 01:18:01,640
Spirit of compassion

1766
01:18:02,580 --> 01:18:06,600
Veronica says how would you how will how

1767
01:18:04,860 --> 01:18:08,280
will you know that your adrenals are

1768
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:09,719
strong after being bedridden for almost

1769
01:18:08,280 --> 01:18:11,940
two years

1770
01:18:09,719 --> 01:18:14,880
what happens is that your adrenals could

1771
01:18:11,940 --> 01:18:17,760
get really strong while you're bedridden

1772
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:20,100
and your bedridden for other reasons

1773
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:21,300
right so someone could be bedridden for

1774
01:18:20,100 --> 01:18:23,100
other reasons like in the medical meme

1775
01:18:21,300 --> 01:18:24,600
books talks about so you can be

1776
01:18:23,100 --> 01:18:26,820
bedridden for another reason but your

1777
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:29,600
adrenals could still get stronger

1778
01:18:26,820 --> 01:18:29,600
and stronger

1779
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:35,820
the one thing about since I was younger

1780
01:18:33,239 --> 01:18:37,500
that Spirit of compassion

1781
01:18:35,820 --> 01:18:40,260
taught me to help people and message

1782
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:42,060
people like taught me so I could be the

1783
01:18:40,260 --> 01:18:44,940
messenger

1784
01:18:42,060 --> 01:18:46,739
was how to restorage renals

1785
01:18:44,940 --> 01:18:49,500
I think one of the things when I see

1786
01:18:46,739 --> 01:18:51,600
someone say something like you know

1787
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:53,580
medical medium doesn't address the

1788
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:55,620
adrenaline or so are you kidding oh my

1789
01:18:53,580 --> 01:18:57,120
God the books are there's so much

1790
01:18:55,620 --> 01:19:00,120
adrenal information in these books I

1791
01:18:57,120 --> 01:19:01,980
almost I almost can't when Spirit of

1792
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:04,920
compassion just keeps on giving me more

1793
01:19:01,980 --> 01:19:06,780
information about adrenals and I have to

1794
01:19:04,920 --> 01:19:08,820
write it down I almost can't handle it

1795
01:19:06,780 --> 01:19:10,620
anymore because I'm like oh my God

1796
01:19:08,820 --> 01:19:13,760
there's so much information about

1797
01:19:10,620 --> 01:19:13,760
adrenals in these books

1798
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:27,179
here's here's what I look here's here's

1799
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:28,440
the when someone goes through a lot of

1800
01:19:27,179 --> 01:19:30,080
trauma and they go through a lot of

1801
01:19:28,440 --> 01:19:32,460
hardship and they've been really hurt

1802
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:35,280
emotionally they've been hurt they've

1803
01:19:32,460 --> 01:19:37,140
gone through a lot I'd like to I know

1804
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:40,140
that a lot of people that they will use

1805
01:19:37,140 --> 01:19:42,840
crying as a release they will use crying

1806
01:19:40,140 --> 01:19:44,100
as a release okay and

1807
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:47,219
um

1808
01:19:44,100 --> 01:19:49,760
uh but what happens is you know the

1809
01:19:47,219 --> 01:19:52,980
bottom line and that can if you feel

1810
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:55,340
compelled to cry you can cry but what I

1811
01:19:52,980 --> 01:19:55,340
love about

why we work right that's the part

everybody knows

1860
01:21:55,800 --> 01:22:01,320
if your job feels like a burden though

1861
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:03,600
if you have a demeaning supervisor or a

1862
01:22:01,320 --> 01:22:06,360
grueling schedule if you feel like your

1863
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:07,980
work has no meaning or no one

1864
01:22:06,360 --> 01:22:11,400
appreciates you

1865
01:22:07,980 --> 01:22:14,100
if you if the inspiration or passion for

1866
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:16,440
what you do is disappearing and you feel

1867
01:22:14,100 --> 01:22:20,340
lost then it's time to shift your

1868
01:22:16,440 --> 01:22:25,199
mindset no matter what you do no matter

1869
01:22:20,340 --> 01:22:28,280
where you do it you work for God

1870
01:22:25,199 --> 01:22:28,280
you work for God

1871
01:22:30,420 --> 01:22:35,400
repeat this aloud

1872
01:22:33,300 --> 01:22:38,460
using whatever term feels most

1873
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:42,179
comfortable for you each day connect to

1874
01:22:38,460 --> 01:22:44,159
it and everything will change

1875
01:22:42,179 --> 01:22:48,600
when you wake up in the morning and open

1876
01:22:44,159 --> 01:22:51,540
your eyes or sit up in bed open the door

1877
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:55,040
to the day and say it

1878
01:22:51,540 --> 01:22:55,040
I work for God

1879
01:22:56,100 --> 01:23:00,420
and if

1880
01:22:57,780 --> 01:23:03,000
if you don't believe in God then maybe

1881
01:23:00,420 --> 01:23:06,960
something else fits in

1882
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:09,120
like I work for the higher source

1883
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:10,500
if that doesn't work for you I work for

1884
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:13,679
the light

1885
01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:16,320
or I work for the divine

1886
01:23:13,679 --> 01:23:18,239
I say every morning when I wake up I

1887
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:20,159
work for God

1888
01:23:18,239 --> 01:23:22,739

1889
01:23:20,159 --> 01:23:24,719

spiritual and physical healing

2076
01:31:11,880 --> 01:31:15,420
information Holly's Health aw is it

2077
01:31:14,159 --> 01:31:18,179
normal to feel different on the

2078
01:31:15,420 --> 01:31:19,620
different days after the light blast yes

2079
01:31:18,179 --> 01:31:23,880
it is everybody has a different

2080
01:31:19,620 --> 01:31:25,860
experience it's so some people days

2081
01:31:23,880 --> 01:31:27,179
later like tomorrow they're going to be

2082
01:31:25,860 --> 01:31:29,219
doing a whole bunch of different stuff

2083
01:31:27,179 --> 01:31:31,560
it it's

2084
01:31:29,219 --> 01:31:33,780
it's like time release

2085
01:31:31,560 --> 01:31:35,100
what's incredible I didn't tell you guys

2086
01:31:33,780 --> 01:31:36,420
and I'm going to talk about it on the

2087
01:31:35,100 --> 01:31:39,840
next light blast

2088
01:31:36,420 --> 01:31:41,639
and I forgot to talk about it

2089
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:43,020
um I forgot to talk about it on the

2090
01:31:41,639 --> 01:31:45,719
light blast

2091
01:31:43,020 --> 01:31:48,060
uh live we just did right just talking

2092
01:31:45,719 --> 01:31:49,080
about it and all that

2093
01:31:48,060 --> 01:31:50,580
but

2094
01:31:49,080 --> 01:31:52,739
you have to remember what's happening

2095
01:31:50,580 --> 01:31:55,260
with the light and where it's coming

2096
01:31:52,739 --> 01:31:57,420
from it's coming from far away

2097
01:31:55,260 --> 01:31:59,580
but it's breaking time and space so

2098
01:31:57,420 --> 01:32:02,460
what's happening is that light is coming

2099
01:31:59,580 --> 01:32:05,300
it's traveling through time it's it's

2100
01:32:02,460 --> 01:32:08,900
literally

2101
01:32:05,300 --> 01:32:08,900
beating time itself

2102
01:32:08,940 --> 01:32:14,639
and what's incredible about that light

2103
01:32:11,880 --> 01:32:16,739
is because that's not light like from

2104
01:32:14,639 --> 01:32:18,179
you look in the sky and there's the sun

2105
01:32:16,739 --> 01:32:20,820
right

2106
01:32:18,179 --> 01:32:22,020
and the Sun is this ball of fire and gas

2107
01:32:20,820 --> 01:32:23,520
right

2108
01:32:22,020 --> 01:32:26,280
and so

2109
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:27,840
that sun is a physical light like that

2110
01:32:26,280 --> 01:32:29,400
right it's just up there and it's just

2111
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:31,199
burning

2112
01:32:29,400 --> 01:32:33,260
the light from the light blast is an

2113
01:32:31,199 --> 01:32:35,940
entirely different light and it's just

2114
01:32:33,260 --> 01:32:38,880
crushing time and space

2115
01:32:35,940 --> 01:32:41,460
to get here like it does from God it's

2116
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:44,520
just unbelievable

2117
01:32:41,460 --> 01:32:47,120

01:32:44,520 --> 01:32:47,120
