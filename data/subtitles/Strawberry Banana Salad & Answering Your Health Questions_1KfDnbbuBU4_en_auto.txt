[30.24 - 34.56] food like bananas
[31.44 - 36.48] with greens leafy greens
[34.56 - 38.08] that's the key it's the leafy greens
[36.48 - 39.20] i've been saying that for years and
[38.08 - 40.88] years and years
[39.20 - 42.88] and that's what's always been missing
[40.88 - 45.12] out of all the diet belief systems out
[42.88 - 46.72] there it's always been the leafy greens
[45.12 - 47.76] it's been missing in all the plant-based
[46.72 - 49.36] diets
[47.76 - 51.28] and it's been missing in all the vegan
[49.36 - 53.12] diets vegetarian diets
[51.28 - 55.28] sure somebody will have lettuce here and
[53.12 - 56.56] there but the leafy greens have always
[55.28 - 58.96] been missing
[56.56 - 60.08] and medical medium information has put
[58.96 - 62.40] the leafy greens
[60.08 - 64.24] into diet belief systems out there now
[62.40 - 66.48] so now you'll see plant-based people
[64.24 - 68.24] all of a sudden start mentioning leafy
[66.48 - 69.68] greens you'll see other people start
[68.24 - 73.04] mentioning leafy greens
[69.68 - 74.96] for the first time in health history and

[226.00 - 229.28] too
[226.96 - 231.20] such an easy recipe and that's one of
[229.28 - 232.56] the key things it's like make it as easy
[231.20 - 234.56] as possible making
[232.56 - 237.12] make it as healing as possible all that
[234.56 - 239.36] matters start with the leafy greens
[237.12 - 240.96] right here so some spinach so i'm going
[239.36 - 241.76] to put some nice spinach leaves now you
[240.96 - 244.48] can chop
[241.76 - 245.44] your greens up i'm going to chop them up
[244.48 - 247.12] a little bit
[245.44 - 249.12] kind of give them a little gentle chop
[247.12 - 250.96] is what i'm going to do just you know
[249.12 - 252.64] a couple of them but you can leave a lot
[250.96 - 254.40] of them whole
[252.64 - 256.16] and that's you know you can do you can
[254.40 - 257.68] do either or so i'm going to put some
[256.16 - 260.32] spinach in
[257.68 - 262.48] probably cut a few pieces up too so i
[260.32 - 266.00] got this beautiful spinach right here
[262.48 - 267.04] getting it in the bowl i'm going to take
[266.00 - 270.48] a few leaves
[267.04 - 270.48] just give them a little chop too
[271.52 - 276.48] you don't want them shredded you want to
[274.24 - 278.56] keep them
[276.48 - 280.96] still you know a decent size this is a
[278.56 - 282.64] baby spinach just letting you guys know
[280.96 - 284.24] now different times of the year there's
[282.64 - 284.96] going to be different kinds of spinach
[284.24 - 289.92] there's going to be
[284.96 - 289.92] really big pieces big leaves
[290.16 - 293.60] roughly leaves of spinach that's out
[292.08 - 297.84] there i'm just cutting a few pieces of
[293.60 - 297.84] baby spinach getting it in here
[298.48 - 301.92] i'm going to put some butter leaf
[299.68 - 304.56] lettuce in here too i'm going to put
[301.92 - 304.56] that in here
[306.56 - 311.44] now you can do i mean look if you don't
[310.40 - 312.88] have the spinach and
[311.44 - 315.12] if you don't have the butter leaf
[312.88 - 317.04] lettuce you can do a mixed green
[315.12 - 318.64] you can look if it's all you got in
[317.04 - 320.40] there is you just got lettuce then let's
[318.64 - 321.04] try that but i want you guys to be able
[320.40 - 323.04] to
[321.04 - 324.16] do the recipe the way it's supposed to
[323.04 - 325.68] be someday so that's
[324.16 - 327.36] so i'm showing you so that's the
[325.68 - 328.96] beautiful spinach i have in here the
[327.36 - 330.16] baby spinach i got the butter leaf
[328.96 - 331.84] lettuce in here too
[330.16 - 334.88] i'm gonna mix it up and put a little bit
[331.84 - 336.56] more put a little bit more butter leaf
[334.88 - 339.84] i'm gonna put a little bit more spinach
[336.56 - 339.84] in here so
[340.08 - 343.36] it's really good to be connected to your
[341.52 - 344.88] food like this too because you really
[343.36 - 346.32] get connected with it it's not just
[344.88 - 349.20] making a recipe it's
[346.32 - 349.20] more than that
[351.60 - 357.76] so so i'm going to mix up these greens a
[356.00 - 360.32] little bit so the spinach and the butter
[357.76 - 361.76] leaf i'm just going to use my hands
[360.32 - 364.96] i'm going to try to read some questions
[361.76 - 367.52] hi there it's moringa
[364.96 - 369.28] and then i saw something about spirulina
[367.52 - 372.08] moringa's not spirulina
[369.28 - 372.48] and meringue is not as good as spirulina
[372.08 - 374.40] um
[372.48 - 377.76] and spirulina is not as good as the best
[374.40 - 379.92] spirulina so don't get that confused too
[377.76 - 380.96] um for any spirulina questions that's
[379.92 - 382.88] the spirulina
[380.96 - 384.72] that i use right there that's the
[382.88 - 388.88] vimergy the is in victor i
[384.72 - 390.32] m e r g y vimergy.com that's the spinach
[388.88 - 391.68] i mean the spirulina talking about
[390.32 - 395.04] spinach and spirulina that's the
[391.68 - 398.08] spirulina that's the good one
[395.04 - 400.48] moringa is really is really not
[398.08 - 402.24] that it's kind of overrated it's not
[400.48 - 404.56] that helpful
[402.24 - 406.56] when it comes down to fixing things and
[404.56 - 406.96] healing things you really need to know
[406.56 - 409.52] what
[406.96 - 410.56] helps you heal and there's so many
[409.52 - 412.08] trendy
[410.56 - 413.76] different things that like products that
[412.08 - 415.44] have been out over the years but
[413.76 - 416.96] you can put as many trendy products as
[415.44 - 420.16] you want out there
[416.96 - 421.28] and you know something can be a buzz hey
[420.16 - 423.52] moringa
[421.28 - 424.56] neem oil you know whatever you want to
[423.52 - 428.00] throw out there
[424.56 - 428.80] but it doesn't mean that it fixes
[428.00 - 430.88] something
[428.80 - 432.40] like what's wrong with you what's going
[430.88 - 433.60] on what kind of illness do you have is
[432.40 - 436.80] it eczema psoriasis
[433.60 - 439.68] is it ra is it hashimoto's is it fibro
[436.80 - 440.88] is it pots is it depression is it
[439.68 - 443.44] anxiety
[440.88 - 444.08] and so moringa can't remove toxic heavy
[443.44 - 446.00] metals
[444.08 - 447.44] from the brain to relieve your
[446.00 - 449.20] depression and anxiety
[447.44 - 451.12] but spirulina can the right kind of
[449.20 - 453.76] spirulina can just like that
[451.12 - 455.52] um so i'm just mixing up some greens i
[453.76 - 458.16] got some beautiful butter leaf
[455.52 - 459.52] i got some spinach leaves right here put
[458.16 - 461.20] a few more in here and then i'm gonna
[459.52 - 462.64] start chopping up some strawberries and
[461.20 - 465.92] some bananas
[462.64 - 467.68] so i'm to do good to see everybody
[465.92 - 470.72] coming on
[467.68 - 472.96] can you add rocket yeah you can
[470.72 - 475.04] you can add rocket if you got if you got
[472.96 - 477.04] rocket kicking around your kitchen
[475.04 - 479.12] that's a cool question could totally do
[477.04 - 482.48] that that's all right
[479.12 - 485.60] so i got this all set here
[482.48 - 487.76] leafy greens are not a vegetable just
[485.60 - 489.44] always keep that in mind so it's not a
[487.76 - 490.96] vegetable it's not like hey i'm having
[489.44 - 492.88] my vegetables
[490.96 - 494.48] nope it's not a vegetable it's a leafy
[492.88 - 496.88] green it's separate
[494.48 - 498.08] so you got the wild foods you got the
[496.88 - 501.20] leafy greens
[498.08 - 504.08] you got your fruits okay you got your
[501.20 - 507.68] vegetables you got your sea vegetables
[504.08 - 509.12] so but you know this
[507.68 - 512.96] you know so it's in and then you got
[509.12 - 512.96] your herbs of course um
[513.28 - 516.80] so i'm just reading some questions here
[518.08 - 521.36] i find it i find it have a lot of sugar
[520.72 - 524.00] wondering
[521.36 - 525.52] if it's not healthy so i'm not sure if
[524.00 - 526.96] like when it comes down to bananas and
[525.52 - 530.08] strawberries
[526.96 - 530.56] that's not the the wrong kind of sugar
[530.08 - 533.04] so
[530.56 - 534.08] you know high fructose corn syrup that's
[533.04 - 537.44] a bad sugar
[534.08 - 539.52] table sugar that's a bad sugar and sugar
[537.44 - 541.36] isn't the problem when it comes down to
[539.52 - 543.04] sickness when it comes down to
[541.36 - 545.36] you know having poor health or symptoms
[543.04 - 547.36] and conditions it's the fats
[545.36 - 549.44] so keep that in mind so it's always the
[547.36 - 552.48] fat so in chocolate cake
[549.44 - 553.92] it's not the sugar that's the real scary
[552.48 - 556.56] part in chocolate cake
[553.92 - 557.44] it's the fat it's the butter it's the
[556.56 - 559.60] oil
[557.44 - 562.40] it's the lard it's anything like that
[559.60 - 564.96] that's inside a chocolate cake
[562.40 - 565.68] and so it's the fats in the chocolate
[564.96 - 568.56] cake
[565.68 - 568.96] that cause the damage not the sugar so
[568.56 - 570.80] then
[568.96 - 572.56] everybody gets scared and they're like
[570.80 - 575.44] i'm not gonna have a strawberry
[572.56 - 576.00] i'm not gonna have a banana and we need
[575.44 - 578.88] sugar to
[576.00 - 581.04] survive without sugar we die so we can't
[578.88 - 583.36] think we can't function we can't walk we
[581.04 - 586.16] can't exercise we can't talk
[583.36 - 587.12] and that's why you know they even care
[586.16 - 588.96] about our
[587.12 - 590.56] sugar you know that's why they even care
[588.96 - 593.04] about our sugar blood
[590.56 - 593.92] sugar is critical to stay alive it's
[593.04 - 595.60] also why
[593.92 - 597.28] how do you save a diabetic's life when
[595.60 - 599.12] they're on the floor
[597.28 - 600.80] you know somewhere in a store and
[599.12 - 602.24] they're just they're seizuring out
[600.80 - 603.44] and they're just literally laying on a
[602.24 - 604.48] floor somewhere and they look like
[603.44 - 606.56] they're drunk
[604.48 - 607.68] and everybody's walking by them and it's
[606.56 - 609.36] a diabetic well
[607.68 - 610.96] you bring a little bit of orange juice
[609.36 - 612.48] with it over to them
[610.96 - 614.48] they drink a little orange juice and
[612.48 - 615.36] they they're actually able to get off
[614.48 - 617.36] the floor
[615.36 - 619.04] and get home and hop into a car can't
[617.36 - 619.76] tell you how many times i've heard the
[619.04 - 621.84] story heard
[619.76 - 623.12] from doctors i heard it from people who
[621.84 - 624.40] are diabetics
[623.12 - 626.24] it's like all of a sudden they're
[624.40 - 628.24] flatline they're on the floor somewhere
[626.24 - 630.08] in a grocery store or
[628.24 - 631.76] they're out shopping and they're laying
[630.08 - 633.04] on a sidewalk and everybody's just
[631.76 - 635.52] walking by them
[633.04 - 637.44] and they're just like hunched over and
[635.52 - 639.52] no one knows what's going on
[637.44 - 642.16] and all they needed was a sip of orange
[639.52 - 644.72] juice sip of sugar to get them off the
[642.16 - 646.72] ground and save their life so it's
[644.72 - 648.08] it's really not like people think it's
[646.72 - 650.96] really how it works
[648.08 - 652.88] um what happens is we eat so much fat
[650.96 - 656.32] that we trap the sugar
[652.88 - 658.24] in our bloodstream and then the sugar
[656.32 - 659.92] becomes a little bit of a problem then
[658.24 - 660.80] but it's not the sugar in the end it's
[659.92 - 662.16] the fat
[660.80 - 664.08] that's in our bloodstream then we get
[662.16 - 666.40] the insulin resistance
[664.08 - 669.28] and then that insulin can't carry the
[666.40 - 669.52] sugar into the cells of the body because
[669.28 - 672.16] of
[669.52 - 673.60] all the fat so you don't want to be
[672.16 - 675.44] afraid of a strawberry when you take a
[673.60 - 678.16] look at this strawberry right here and
[675.44 - 679.84] i got them right here look at these so
[678.16 - 682.24] see the strawberries right here you guys
[679.84 - 683.20] that's a beautiful strawberry right here
[682.24 - 686.40] so
[683.20 - 688.96] that is a healing food an incredible
[686.40 - 690.88] healing food everybody's worried about
[688.96 - 691.20] how they look with aging they're worried
[690.88 - 693.28] about
[691.20 - 694.40] wrinkles they're worried about aging too

[713.04 - 716.08] fear
[713.68 - 718.16] and it's like fear about fruit fear
[716.08 - 719.20] about bananas fear about strawberries
[718.16 - 721.36] that's what we're taught and we're

[744.88 - 748.24] okay they're like foreign to the health
[747.84 - 751.20] scene
[748.24 - 752.16] for years i can't tell you how many
[751.20 - 755.36] health gurus that

[820.32 - 826.16] forget it like what's a leafy green
[823.36 - 826.64] even 20 years ago what's a leafy green
[826.16 - 828.88] and
[826.64 - 831.36] even still today even with all the
[828.88 - 833.92] teaching the lectures i've done
[831.36 - 835.12] how many um people in the health scene
[833.92 - 836.72] reached out for help
[835.12 - 838.64] reached out for answers from mystery
[836.72 - 840.80] illnesses all these years
[838.64 - 841.76] i've talked to thousands and thousands
[840.80 - 843.84] of people
[841.76 - 844.96] they still didn't know about leafy
[843.84 - 846.72] greens
[844.96 - 848.16] it's weird they would say do you mean a
[846.72 - 852.24] salad
[848.16 - 855.36] um aw are you talking about a salad
[852.24 - 857.60] like yeah a salad of iceberg lettuce no
[855.36 - 859.60] talking about leafy greens anyway
[857.60 - 861.12] cutting the backs off of these
[859.60 - 863.12] you don't have to if you don't want to
[861.12 - 864.80] you can save those you can eat those
[863.12 - 866.32] whatever you can do you can throw them
[864.80 - 866.72] in yourself i like to take them off on
[866.32 - 870.40] these
[866.72 - 872.24] okay so i'm chopping uh
[870.40 - 874.72] the little caps off the strawberries
[872.24 - 874.72] right here
[874.88 - 880.24] you guys can share a protocol someone
[879.36 - 884.64] with chronic
[880.24 - 886.96] lime okay so
[884.64 - 887.68] in this book right here so you might
[886.96 - 890.00] want to check
[887.68 - 891.76] check it out on amazon okay this is the
[890.00 - 893.36] revised and expanded so you got to make
[891.76 - 895.20] sure it's the new edition revised and
[893.36 - 898.24] expanded medical medium book
[895.20 - 901.44] there's a lyme disease chapter and
[898.24 - 903.60] i broke the truth out there about lyme
[901.44 - 905.76] disease about the cause of lyme disease
[903.60 - 907.92] and why people have neurological lyme
[905.76 - 909.20] and how things like cats claw are
[907.92 - 912.00] critical and other
[909.20 - 912.72] other tools so and i talk about it in
[912.00 - 914.00] here so
[912.72 - 915.44] and i'll give you a little rundown of
[914.00 - 916.80] lyme disease but you want to check out
[915.44 - 917.44] the medical medium book one the new
[916.80 - 920.80] edition
[917.44 - 922.00] that's the all-time like information
[920.80 - 924.64] about lyme disease
[922.00 - 926.00] lyme disease is not bacterial so if that
[924.64 - 929.12] turns you off or gets you
[926.00 - 931.92] upset don't let it because
[929.12 - 934.48] science and research have now because of
[931.92 - 936.24] medical medium information in fact
[934.48 - 937.84] a famous doctor just reached out to me
[936.24 - 940.24] recently and said that
[937.84 - 941.20] he's really happy that that's medical
[940.24 - 943.20] science
[941.20 - 944.48] took lyme disease out of the bacteria
[943.20 - 946.24] category so
[944.48 - 947.52] they don't believe it's bacteria anymore
[946.24 - 949.84] because
[947.52 - 952.32] of the millions of medical medium books
[949.84 - 955.52] that told the truth that it's viral
[952.32 - 957.36] so so millions of people took
[955.52 - 958.88] the book the first book the first
[957.36 - 960.48] edition right this is the second edition
[958.88 - 961.04] they took the book into their doctor's
[960.48 - 964.08] offices
[961.04 - 965.20] and said he says it's viral and so
[964.08 - 968.08] because of that it
[965.20 - 969.84] changed lyme disease so all these years
[968.08 - 971.84] later now they took they removed lyme
[969.84 - 973.60] disease out of bacterial and now it's an
[971.84 - 975.04] autoimmune category which means they
[973.60 - 977.12] don't know the cause of it
[975.04 - 978.72] but autoimmune the cause of autoimmune
[977.12 - 981.36] is viral so just letting you know
[978.72 - 982.08] so the first way to heal lyme disease is
[981.36 - 985.60] to know
[982.08 - 987.68] what the cause is what's causing my
[985.60 - 989.76] symptoms what's causing my neurological
[987.68 - 993.36] symptoms that someone
[989.76 - 996.48] that a doctor says is lyme disease um
[993.36 - 998.08] and so viruses such as epstein-barr
[996.48 - 999.84] and here's the funny thing it's not
[998.08 - 1002.56] funny but interesting
[999.84 - 1005.12] is that doctors check they test for
[1002.56 - 1006.72] epstein-barr now with lyme patients
[1005.12 - 1009.60] because of medical medium books because
[1006.72 - 1012.72] i said that hey lyme disease is caused
[1009.60 - 1013.44] by epstein-barr and shingles okay and so
[1012.72 - 1015.84] what they do
[1013.44 - 1017.36] is they test for epstein-barr lyme you
[1015.84 - 1018.80] know lyme patients they get tested for
[1017.36 - 1020.40] that so they're always getting a lyme
[1018.80 - 1022.48] test and an epstein-barr test now
[1020.40 - 1024.40] they're getting both at the same time
[1022.48 - 1027.12] because of medical medium books so i'm
[1024.40 - 1030.32] cutting up these strawberries
[1027.12 - 1031.84] right here putting some nice strawberry
[1030.32 - 1033.60] pieces in the salad
[1031.84 - 1035.68] you can cut them up as small as you want
[1033.60 - 1036.48] to cut them up these are the sizes i'm
[1035.68 - 1039.84] cutting up
[1036.48 - 1039.84] cutting them up right here
[1041.52 - 1045.52] so putting some nice strawberry pieces
[1044.96 - 1046.96] on here
[1045.52 - 1048.56] strawberry banana salad is what i'm
[1046.96 - 1051.28] making you guys
[1048.56 - 1053.92] when you eat a food like this when you
[1051.28 - 1057.04] eat a recipe like this
[1053.92 - 1060.40] be mindful for what it's doing for you
[1057.04 - 1061.36] like keep that in your consciousness
[1060.40 - 1064.88] okay
[1061.36 - 1067.92] because when you respect the food
[1064.88 - 1069.20] that's actually healing you a connection
[1067.92 - 1071.92] is made
[1069.20 - 1073.28] that's really important to know and hey
[1071.92 - 1074.56] if you don't respect the food that's
[1073.28 - 1076.16] healing you and you don't care and
[1074.56 - 1077.92] you're just eating it or trying it out
[1076.16 - 1080.96] it's still gonna help heal you
[1077.92 - 1084.00] but so i want to talk about
[1080.96 - 1084.32] why healing foods are so important for
[1084.00 - 1087.76] us
[1084.32 - 1089.68] one thing is fragrances okay so
[1087.76 - 1091.76] fragrances that are made from chemical
[1089.68 - 1093.44] companies that saturate us every day so
[1091.76 - 1095.60] when you go into the store
[1093.44 - 1096.64] you get hit you get assaulted by
[1095.60 - 1100.08] fragrances
[1096.64 - 1102.24] that's colognes that's perfumes and then
[1100.08 - 1103.36] we're taught by chemical companies to
[1102.24 - 1106.24] breathe it in to
[1103.36 - 1107.12] like the smell air fresheners scented
[1106.24 - 1109.76] candles
[1107.12 - 1111.04] so here's the thing everybody's so
[1109.76 - 1113.36] health-minded these days
[1111.04 - 1115.36] everybody's you know like a health guru
[1113.36 - 1116.16] now everybody's like a health hack or
[1115.36 - 1119.20] everybody's like
[1116.16 - 1120.64] into health and and you see that now
[1119.20 - 1123.44] everybody knows a little bit something
[1120.64 - 1125.92] about health right but at the same time
[1123.44 - 1127.36] they seem to know a lot about health or
[1125.92 - 1129.76] seem to know anything about health
[1127.36 - 1131.20] they're lighting the candles so they're
[1129.76 - 1132.56] doing all these things
[1131.20 - 1135.44] to help themselves they're doing their
[1132.56 - 1138.56] avocado toast they're doing their
[1135.44 - 1140.16] oatmeal with some raisins they're taking
[1138.56 - 1142.48] care of themselves right
[1140.16 - 1144.80] they're doing their almond milk even
[1142.48 - 1146.88] though that's not the best but whatever
[1144.80 - 1148.32] they're doing these things and they're
[1146.88 - 1150.08] like hey i'm eating healthier i'm
[1148.32 - 1151.92] working out i'm exercising and then
[1150.08 - 1154.24] they're burning scented candles
[1151.92 - 1155.04] and they're they're they're going
[1154.24 - 1157.20] against they're
[1155.04 - 1159.36] countering all the good stuff they're
[1157.20 - 1160.08] doing for themselves they're countering
[1159.36 - 1162.64] it
[1160.08 - 1164.72] so they might eat a good meal they might
[1162.64 - 1165.76] stay away from processed foods and fried
[1164.72 - 1167.76] greasy foods
[1165.76 - 1169.12] but they're sucking in dangerous
[1167.76 - 1172.64] chemicals like
[1169.12 - 1176.08] scented candles air fresheners
[1172.64 - 1178.56] fabric softeners conventional detergents
[1176.08 - 1180.64] right and they're just breathing it all
[1178.56 - 1182.56] in and they're doing it at their homes
[1180.64 - 1184.64] and they're just they're sucking in all
[1182.56 - 1188.08] that chemical oil
[1184.64 - 1191.28] and that toxic oil those toxic chemicals
[1188.08 - 1195.12] are more damaging and more
[1191.28 - 1196.88] toxic than smoking so you know years ago
[1195.12 - 1198.72] you guys everybody would be smoking
[1196.88 - 1200.88] everywhere you'd smoke in public you'd
[1198.72 - 1203.44] smoke in the hospital
[1200.88 - 1204.48] okay you can be a patient in the
[1203.44 - 1207.84] hospital
[1204.48 - 1209.52] years ago in the 80s and you can smoke
[1207.84 - 1211.84] cigarettes while you're in bed
[1209.52 - 1213.52] you can smoke cigarettes while you're in
[1211.84 - 1215.92] bed whether you're there for
[1213.52 - 1217.76] like a you know something going on like
[1215.92 - 1219.28] you know you had an anxiety attack and
[1217.76 - 1220.00] now you're in the hospital or maybe you
[1219.28 - 1221.28] had a fever
[1220.00 - 1222.96] or something and you're in the hospital
[1221.28 - 1224.36] you could just light up your cigarettes
[1222.96 - 1227.28] right there
[1224.36 - 1230.08] 1985 1987
[1227.28 - 1231.84] i used to visit people who would ask me
[1230.08 - 1234.96] for help they would say can you visit
[1231.84 - 1236.72] you visit my family member aw
[1234.96 - 1238.08] can you go to the hospital and see a
[1236.72 - 1240.08] family member that's
[1238.08 - 1242.00] very ill because we want to see if you
[1240.08 - 1243.28] have any answers the doctor wants to
[1242.00 - 1244.08] talk to you and see if you have any
[1243.28 - 1245.92] answers
[1244.08 - 1248.40] so i would go to the hospital and you
[1245.92 - 1251.20] just walk in or you walk by you walk
[1248.40 - 1251.68] you walk down the hallway and in every
[1251.20 - 1254.48] room
[1251.68 - 1256.32] everybody's smoking in their beds and
[1254.48 - 1259.60] that like 1987
[1256.32 - 1260.56] 1989 1990s just smoking in their beds in
[1259.60 - 1262.32] the hospital right
[1260.56 - 1264.16] you go into a restaurant everybody's
[1262.32 - 1265.76] smoking in the restaurant sucking down
[1264.16 - 1267.60] cigarettes everywhere
[1265.76 - 1269.36] all that smoking is happening in the
[1267.60 - 1270.72] restaurant some i'm chopping up some
[1269.36 - 1274.40] strawberries right here
[1270.72 - 1278.56] and so what happens is that
[1274.40 - 1281.20] with all that smoking going on okay
[1278.56 - 1282.32] um with all that smoking going on
[1281.20 - 1284.08] everywhere in the past
[1282.32 - 1285.76] they stopped it right it's banned you
[1284.08 - 1288.32] can't smoke in a public place
[1285.76 - 1289.20] you can't smoke in a hospital you can't
[1288.32 - 1292.16] smoke
[1289.20 - 1293.28] in church you could smoke in church
[1292.16 - 1295.44] right after prayer
[1293.28 - 1296.72] boom light up your cigarettes just be
[1295.44 - 1298.96] smoking right inside
[1296.72 - 1300.56] right inside the church but guess what
[1298.96 - 1304.72] right you can't anymore
[1300.56 - 1306.80] no smoking but guess what that smoke
[1304.72 - 1308.08] was nothing compared to what you're
[1306.80 - 1311.68] breathing in now
[1308.08 - 1314.40] those cigarettes were a joke they were a
[1311.68 - 1315.60] joke compared and they still are now
[1314.40 - 1318.80] anybody's smoking now
[1315.60 - 1321.28] it's a joke compared to air fresheners
[1318.80 - 1323.68] that's the killer man that's the killer
[1321.28 - 1326.40] no one's keeping tabs on
[1323.68 - 1327.36] those cigarettes are a joke compared to
[1326.40 - 1330.08] cologne
[1327.36 - 1332.64] the cologne is the killer you slap your
[1330.08 - 1334.16] man slaps on that cologne your man slaps
[1332.64 - 1335.60] on all that cologne
[1334.16 - 1337.44] he's killing you and you don't even know
[1335.60 - 1340.32] it take that stuff
[1337.44 - 1341.92] toss it out you know tell your man that
[1340.32 - 1344.24] cologne's going
[1341.92 - 1346.48] because the cologne is ladled in
[1344.24 - 1350.00] chemical company toxins like
[1346.48 - 1353.52] real serious ones aftershave cologne
[1350.00 - 1356.48] hair products hair spray scented candles
[1353.52 - 1358.72] fabric softeners air fresheners those
[1356.48 - 1361.20] are the killers right now
[1358.72 - 1363.44] that's the assault on women and women's
[1361.20 - 1367.44] health and men's health
[1363.44 - 1370.24] so man those cigarettes
[1367.44 - 1371.04] they don't touch they don't touch the
[1370.24 - 1374.32] destruction
[1371.04 - 1375.76] and the damage that all those fragrances
[1374.32 - 1377.68] are causing right now
[1375.76 - 1378.88] they don't even touch it but here's the
[1377.68 - 1380.56] sick part right
[1378.88 - 1382.48] chemical companies want to make sure
[1380.56 - 1385.52] that you're trained
[1382.48 - 1386.88] that you're trained in thinking these
[1385.52 - 1388.32] smells are good
[1386.88 - 1390.24] you're trained to go hey i'm going to
[1388.32 - 1392.00] light the scented chemical
[1390.24 - 1394.08] candle and what does it smell like
[1392.00 - 1395.52] christmas what does it smell like
[1394.08 - 1397.20] you know what does it smell like a
[1395.52 - 1398.24] christmas tree what does it smell like
[1397.20 - 1401.36] you know in the whole bit
[1398.24 - 1403.92] and we're being trained to actually
[1401.36 - 1404.64] breathe all this stuff in we're being
[1403.92 - 1408.48] trained
[1404.64 - 1410.00] to get poisoned so you know it's kind of
[1408.48 - 1411.68] funny i see a lot of people that think
[1410.00 - 1414.16] they know a lot about health out there
[1411.68 - 1415.68] okay and i've seen that for years right
[1414.16 - 1416.00] you know i haven't been in this for two
[1415.68 - 1417.68] years
[1416.00 - 1419.76] or five years or seven years been in
[1417.68 - 1422.00] this for over 35 years right
[1419.76 - 1423.04] and i've shaped health of what it's
[1422.00 - 1425.28] today like i've
[1423.04 - 1427.12] shaped it all with the information from
[1425.28 - 1429.44] mm going all the way back
[1427.12 - 1430.72] and all so many of the tools are in
[1429.44 - 1432.16] medical medium
[1430.72 - 1433.76] medical medium tools are out there in
[1432.16 - 1434.48] the world and people are using them
[1433.76 - 1436.96] they're not
[1434.48 - 1438.00] they're not citing it back you know some
[1436.96 - 1441.04] people do
[1438.00 - 1444.08] but the bottom line is
[1441.04 - 1446.48] you know with this is that
[1444.08 - 1448.08] there's information in these in this in
[1446.48 - 1450.32] in these healing tools
[1448.08 - 1451.84] to help us battle these things like
[1450.32 - 1453.60] fragrances and other stuff but people
[1451.84 - 1455.28] don't know about that stuff they just
[1453.60 - 1457.28] don't even get it i mean there's so many
[1455.28 - 1459.12] people that are into yoga yoga studios
[1457.28 - 1461.60] that are like burning incense that have
[1459.12 - 1463.52] chemicals in them and it's like hey a
[1461.60 - 1466.96] friend of mine was at a yoga studio
[1463.52 - 1469.04] and said this the smell was so strong
[1466.96 - 1470.96] her eyes were burning it's because a lot
[1469.04 - 1473.44] of the incense is not like
[1470.96 - 1475.04] natural it's got chemicals in it the
[1473.44 - 1476.96] fragrances are in there so you want
[1475.04 - 1478.64] fragrance free wherever you go
[1476.96 - 1480.08] you want to protect yourself when you
[1478.64 - 1482.80] order new clothes
[1480.08 - 1483.20] saturated with all kinds of chemicals
[1482.80 - 1486.08] and
[1483.20 - 1487.68] you got to think about children and you
[1486.08 - 1490.08] got to think about babies
[1487.68 - 1491.92] and if you got air fresheners in your
[1490.08 - 1494.16] house pull them out of the wall
[1491.92 - 1495.36] throw them out so that your babies
[1494.16 - 1497.12] aren't breathing that in
[1495.36 - 1499.04] just that's how you do it that's how you
[1497.12 - 1501.12] protect your families
[1499.04 - 1502.88] and get rid of the scented candles
[1501.12 - 1504.64] because those are killers
[1502.88 - 1506.32] those are killers and they're really
[1504.64 - 1508.88] really rough on people
[1506.32 - 1510.16] um so we're being yeah lorraine hey
[1508.88 - 1511.92] lorraine's there
[1510.16 - 1514.16] we're being trained to be poisoned we
[1511.92 - 1517.20] really are and that's what's happening
[1514.16 - 1519.12] and what's in these fragrances
[1517.20 - 1520.64] are toxic heavy metals so that's another
[1519.12 - 1521.20] thing too if you just guys just got on
[1520.64 - 1522.80] there
[1521.20 - 1524.64] i'm on a rant right here about
[1522.80 - 1526.72] fragrances toxic heavy metals and
[1524.64 - 1529.60] fragrances the poisons involved
[1526.72 - 1531.12] how smoking is a joke compared to these
[1529.60 - 1531.92] toxic chemicals that we're breathing in
[1531.12 - 1533.36] every day
[1531.92 - 1535.04] we're being trained to like the smell of
[1533.36 - 1536.00] perfume we're being trained to breathe
[1535.04 - 1539.04] in cologne it's
[1536.00 - 1541.44] everywhere you walk into a grocery store
[1539.04 - 1542.16] i mean it's pumping with all kinds of
[1541.44 - 1544.32] cleaners
[1542.16 - 1545.28] it's pumping with all kinds of cleaners
[1544.32 - 1547.28] that they're spraying that they're
[1545.28 - 1547.84] mopping floors with that are completely
[1547.28 - 1550.56] toxic
[1547.84 - 1552.00] it's it's pumping with clone aftershave
[1550.56 - 1553.52] perfume everywhere
[1552.00 - 1556.24] anyway i'm making the strawberry banana
[1553.52 - 1557.20] salad it's a way to counter all this
[1556.24 - 1559.52] stuff
[1557.20 - 1561.12] so if you wonder why hey why should i
[1559.52 - 1565.92] eat healthy
[1561.12 - 1565.92] and another thing too is like
[1566.00 - 1569.84] we should really like say something out
[1568.16 - 1571.44] there you know we should talk about it
[1569.84 - 1573.60] out there a little bit more we should
[1571.44 - 1575.44] ask for the fragrance free the more you
[1573.60 - 1576.88] ask the more you talk about it the more
[1575.44 - 1579.76] they stop
[1576.88 - 1581.28] and because you don't want all that
[1579.76 - 1583.44] chemical soaking in your
[1581.28 - 1584.88] your food right so i wash these
[1583.44 - 1588.00] strawberries really good
[1584.88 - 1590.32] because i noticed that when i got
[1588.00 - 1592.24] these strawberries right that they had
[1590.32 - 1593.20] like a cologne smell going on on the
[1592.24 - 1594.88] packages
[1593.20 - 1597.28] because of the store it had like a
[1594.88 - 1599.68] chemical smell slash cologne smell
[1597.28 - 1601.44] slash air freshener smell and i had to
[1599.68 - 1603.36] wash these strawberries really good like
[1601.44 - 1606.16] i had to wash them good
[1603.36 - 1607.52] to actually get that off of them and
[1606.16 - 1609.76] it's like it's just unfair
[1607.52 - 1611.04] it's like what you know it's like you
[1609.76 - 1612.48] may as well just bring the cigarettes
[1611.04 - 1613.12] back man just bring them back
[1612.48 - 1615.04] everybody's
[1613.12 - 1616.40] smoke just why not who cares because
[1615.04 - 1618.32] guess what we're doing
[1616.40 - 1620.40] all the other stuff and it's killing us
[1618.32 - 1622.16] so let's all just light up go into the
[1620.40 - 1623.04] grocery stores light up everybody light
[1622.16 - 1625.68] up and just
[1623.04 - 1627.36] why not hey it's safer than all this
[1625.68 - 1629.52] stuff i can tell you that it's actually
[1627.36 - 1632.72] safer but no don't start smoking let's
[1629.52 - 1632.72] get some bananas chopped up
[1634.08 - 1639.28] anyway does that include organic
[1637.44 - 1640.08] perfumes organic scented candles yes
[1639.28 - 1641.76] because organic
[1640.08 - 1644.96] doesn't mean anything because the
[1641.76 - 1647.36] chemical fragrances get into those two
[1644.96 - 1649.52] it's different if it's a candle that
[1647.36 - 1650.64] just has an essential oil in it like
[1649.52 - 1653.04] maybe it just
[1650.64 - 1655.60] has essential oil and then beeswax
[1653.04 - 1658.08] essential oil and then maybe a soy wax
[1655.60 - 1659.04] say right and it's just a little bit of
[1658.08 - 1662.40] that but
[1659.04 - 1666.00] perfumes that even are organic are still
[1662.40 - 1666.40] ladled in like chemical they're still in
[1666.00 - 1668.40] there
[1666.40 - 1671.20] that's the trick that's a whole nother
[1668.40 - 1674.08] game too going on
[1671.20 - 1676.48] um so i got some bananas so i'm just
[1674.08 - 1678.08] going to cut them in these nice pieces
[1676.48 - 1679.92] you don't want them too small but you
[1678.08 - 1680.56] don't want them too big so i'm just
[1679.92 - 1686.08] cutting them
[1680.56 - 1686.08] right here this is a really nice banana
[1686.96 - 1690.80] cigarettes are filled with chemicals
[1688.48 - 1693.84] right yeah they are okay
[1690.80 - 1693.84] scented candles
[1695.04 - 1700.24] 100 times worse i wouldn't even probably
[1698.00 - 1703.84] worse than even 100 times
[1700.24 - 1706.80] okay it's it's an oil base
[1703.84 - 1707.68] scented candles have an oil base of a
[1706.80 - 1710.00] soup
[1707.68 - 1711.92] of dangerous chemicals synthetically
[1710.00 - 1714.16] made in a chemical factory
[1711.92 - 1715.52] that aren't tested no one knows what the
[1714.16 - 1718.16] damage that it could be done
[1715.52 - 1719.92] on people in their lungs their body how
[1718.16 - 1722.96] it can promote cancer like
[1719.92 - 1724.80] be literally a trigger for cancer
[1722.96 - 1726.00] so here we're worried about cancer
[1724.80 - 1727.68] everybody's worried about women are
[1726.00 - 1730.08] worried about cancer
[1727.68 - 1731.60] and they're being assaulted with all
[1730.08 - 1733.28] these chemicals 24 7
[1731.60 - 1735.36] breathing them in and their families and
[1733.28 - 1738.80] their children and
[1735.36 - 1740.24] this is no joke it's no joke man um
[1738.80 - 1742.72] i'm cutting up these bananas and little
[1740.24 - 1745.28] pieces here
[1742.72 - 1753.84] that's what i'm doing i'm gonna stack
[1745.28 - 1753.84] them and do it this way
[1755.44 - 1759.44] put some nice little banana pieces here
[1760.72 - 1765.12] carol how do you wash strawberries i put
[1763.52 - 1767.20] them in a big bowl of water right
[1765.12 - 1768.72] one one bigger than this you can use a
[1767.20 - 1769.52] smaller one but i use a bowl like that
[1768.72 - 1773.28] right
[1769.52 - 1776.88] and i put a little bit of
[1773.28 - 1777.60] no fragrance soap okay a little bit of a
[1776.88 - 1781.36] natural
[1777.60 - 1783.04] real natural clean clean soap um
[1781.36 - 1784.56] you can use one you have that doesn't
[1783.04 - 1786.40] have fragrances in it
[1784.56 - 1788.40] okay just a little drop a couple of
[1786.40 - 1791.12] drops you just give it a good rinse
[1788.40 - 1793.20] i'm gonna put these banana pieces in
[1791.12 - 1797.76] it's a lot better than what could be
[1793.20 - 1797.76] you know on the food from the store
[1798.48 - 1803.52] got my banana pieces in there i'm going
[1799.92 - 1803.52] to put one more banana in here too
[1805.52 - 1808.80] martha says cologne smell perfume
[1807.68 - 1811.20] scented detergent
[1808.80 - 1814.00] candles air fresheners send me gagging
[1811.20 - 1817.12] and running out of the room
[1814.00 - 1817.52] rightfully so totally rightfully so for
[1817.12 - 1821.68] real
[1817.52 - 1823.12] because um it's that bad
[1821.68 - 1824.72] make sure all your products are
[1823.12 - 1826.80] fragrance free
[1824.72 - 1828.16] that's that's important right there
[1826.80 - 1831.04] here's the other thing too
[1828.16 - 1832.96] they have us chemical companies right
[1831.04 - 1835.20] have a so saturated with dangerous
[1832.96 - 1836.88] chemicals all the time
[1835.20 - 1839.20] that we don't know what we're smelling
[1836.88 - 1842.72] anymore we don't know
[1839.20 - 1845.84] if you're in a home or apartment
[1842.72 - 1846.72] or wherever you live right and wherever
[1845.84 - 1850.00] you are
[1846.72 - 1851.84] and you're there and you don't
[1850.00 - 1853.60] have all those fragrances and you don't
[1851.84 - 1855.04] smell all the smells and then you walk
[1853.60 - 1856.64] into somebody's house
[1855.04 - 1858.40] and you smell everything you smell their
[1856.64 - 1859.76] detergents you smell their perfumes you
[1858.40 - 1861.44] smell their cologne smell their scented
[1859.76 - 1863.36] candles or air fresheners right

[1863.36 - 1869.68] know what they're smelling in there like
[1866.72 - 1870.40] they have no idea it's that bad and
[1869.68 - 1874.40] meanwhile

[1876.40 - 1879.76] illness one more step closer to chronic
[1878.24 - 1882.24] fatigue syndrome
[1879.76 - 1883.12] one step closer to depression one step
[1882.24 - 1886.64] closer
[1883.12 - 1889.60] to to anxiety those
[1886.64 - 1891.68] chemical compounds those dangerous

[2147.20 - 2151.44] a cup
[2147.68 - 2152.80] probably even a little bit more there um
[2151.44 - 2154.96] i want to talk about chocolate a little
[2152.80 - 2156.40] bit too in a minute because
[2154.96 - 2157.68] i want to go into that a little bit i
[2156.40 - 2159.60] want to talk about coffee too there's
[2157.68 - 2162.24] one thing that people don't realize
[2159.60 - 2164.32] that thousands and thousands and
[2162.24 - 2165.44] thousands of workers over the years have
[2164.32 - 2167.60] died
[2165.44 - 2169.28] picking coffee so everybody can have
[2167.60 - 2172.08] their cup and get jacked up on
[2169.28 - 2173.52] on the coffee high and it's it's kept
[2172.08 - 2174.88] kept on the down low
[2173.52 - 2176.96] no one talks about it because the
[2174.88 - 2178.72] caffeine industry is so powerful
[2176.96 - 2179.84] that they don't let that secret out
[2178.72 - 2182.08] right i talk about that in the medical
[2179.84 - 2184.72] medium podcast at apple podcast
[2182.08 - 2187.04] check out my my chocolate much tea
[2184.72 - 2188.40] coffee episode on medical beam podcast
[2187.04 - 2190.64] at apple podcast
[2188.40 - 2192.40] and it's like it's it's really
[2190.64 - 2194.88] disturbing how it works
[2192.40 - 2196.24] when you're picking coffee all day long
[2194.88 - 2198.00] and you're sweating
[2196.24 - 2200.24] and you're you're rubbing on you're
[2198.00 - 2201.52] rubbing on all of the leaves
[2200.24 - 2204.08] and you got you're rubbing on all the
[2201.52 - 2205.68] coffee and you're actually in the groves
[2204.08 - 2208.32] and you're getting covered with that
[2205.68 - 2209.84] toxin something happens and i talk all
[2208.32 - 2210.96] about it medical medium podcast at apple
[2209.84 - 2214.08] podcast and how many
[2210.96 - 2217.12] people have died all through the years
[2214.08 - 2220.16] and how serious that is um
[2217.12 - 2220.96] and also we can have some coffee so we
[2220.16 - 2222.72] can have you know
[2220.96 - 2225.20] we can be jacked up in the morning so we
[2222.72 - 2226.56] can hide all our symptoms and issues
[2225.20 - 2228.88] that the medical industry doesn't want
[2226.56 - 2232.32] anybody to really know we have
[2228.88 - 2233.60] and you know and then
[2232.32 - 2236.40] that's how it works so i'm gonna put
[2233.60 - 2238.40] some banana in here
[2236.40 - 2240.48] doing about a third of a cup chopped
[2238.40 - 2242.88] banana
[2240.48 - 2244.08] you don't have to do a lot this is just
[2242.88 - 2247.36] the dressing
[2244.08 - 2247.36] i just lost a piece right there
[2248.56 - 2252.00] talk about chocolate in a minute too
[2250.80 - 2253.76] it's interesting there's no
[2252.00 - 2254.96] there's no such thing as fair trade when
[2253.76 - 2257.28] it comes down to chocolate or
[2254.96 - 2259.04] sustainable
[2257.28 - 2260.80] it's really sad when you see that market
[2259.04 - 2264.08] it like that because
[2260.80 - 2265.44] the farmers who are farming chocolate
[2264.08 - 2268.80] cacao
[2265.44 - 2272.40] they're penniless they're in utter
[2268.80 - 2273.92] poverty i mean i'm talking starvation
[2272.40 - 2276.72] poverty they make about 100
[2273.92 - 2277.76] 100 a year so they sit there cutting
[2276.72 - 2279.60] cacao
[2277.76 - 2282.32] they kill themselves getting it to
[2279.60 - 2285.68] market they get ripped off they get paid
[2282.32 - 2288.80] nothing people in africa and
[2285.68 - 2291.12] what happens is that um
[2288.80 - 2292.32] i mean we're talking they're in poverty
[2291.12 - 2295.44] and they get ripped off
[2292.32 - 2296.96] so when when their cacao is bought for
[2295.44 - 2299.36] them purchased from them
[2296.96 - 2300.88] so it can go into into the market and
[2299.36 - 2302.48] then become like chocolate cake
[2300.88 - 2303.36] chocolate candies chocolate whatever
[2302.48 - 2307.12] cacao
[2303.36 - 2310.08] nibs what happens is that when when that
[2307.12 - 2311.84] when that um chocolate finally moves
[2310.08 - 2313.44] into the market nobody knows what
[2311.84 - 2315.12] happened and where it came from and
[2313.44 - 2316.32] everybody's ripped off so all the
[2315.12 - 2319.12] farmers are ripped
[2316.32 - 2320.32] off they given they're given pennies
[2319.12 - 2321.92] they're starving they get
[2320.32 - 2323.68] cheated and they're sitting there
[2321.92 - 2325.20] sweating killing killing themselves
[2323.68 - 2327.92] their families are trying to pick
[2325.20 - 2328.88] a cow off trees so they can get one
[2327.92 - 2331.84] penny
[2328.88 - 2333.44] for like five pods of cacao one penny
[2331.84 - 2336.40] for like 50 pods of
[2333.44 - 2337.84] one nickel for 50 pods of cacao right
[2336.40 - 2339.36] and so when you go in and you're buying
[2337.84 - 2340.64] your chocolate bar you get your cacao
[2339.36 - 2342.00] nibs and you're throwing on top your
[2340.64 - 2342.40] smoothies you're throwing it on top of
[2342.00 - 2344.24] your
[2342.40 - 2345.44] your food and everything like that and
[2344.24 - 2346.16] everybody's telling you to plant
[2345.44 - 2348.00] medicine
[2346.16 - 2349.60] it's good for you and meanwhile just
[2348.00 - 2350.88] getting you high and jacking you up on
[2349.60 - 2353.44] caffeine which
[2350.88 - 2354.00] ages you fast and nobody realizes it
[2353.44 - 2356.80] well you're being
[2354.00 - 2359.60] told all that and you wouldn't believe
[2356.80 - 2362.72] the wake of a disaster that's occurring
[2359.60 - 2364.72] for the growers i mean it's so sad it's
[2362.72 - 2366.72] devastating it's like armageddon it's
[2364.72 - 2367.12] like literally the apocalypse it's so
[2366.72 - 2369.52] bad
[2367.12 - 2371.28] and they're intense and they're
[2369.52 - 2373.52] literally dying some of them
[2371.28 - 2376.00] intense they try to they get up they try
[2373.52 - 2378.16] to they try to pick more cacao for you
[2376.00 - 2380.08] and and they're getting pennies some of
[2378.16 - 2382.32] them some families only make 50
[2380.08 - 2383.44] for a whole year of harvesting and
[2382.32 - 2385.84] killing themselves
[2383.44 - 2387.20] getting cacao ready for the market and
[2385.84 - 2389.20] when you think about that and then they
[2387.20 - 2391.12] say oh it's sustainable this cacao is
[2389.20 - 2392.08] sustainable this chocolate's sustainable
[2391.12 - 2393.92] it's fair trade
[2392.08 - 2397.52] it's like are you freaking kidding me
[2393.92 - 2399.92] that's just sick it's actually demented
[2397.52 - 2402.56] all right let's make it let's make it
[2399.92 - 2402.56] dressing here
[2403.84 - 2407.28] it's always something something to talk
[2405.60 - 2411.20] about you guys
[2407.28 - 2413.12] always something to talk about so
[2411.20 - 2416.24] i got a little strainer here so i'm
[2413.12 - 2418.40] gonna just drop some lemon juice in here
[2416.24 - 2420.96] so you could do like one one teaspoon
[2418.40 - 2425.44] two teaspoons
[2420.96 - 2428.64] i'm gonna try for one teaspoon in here
[2425.44 - 2428.64] to get it to spin
[2429.44 - 2433.52] you do um and then i'm going to add a
[2432.24 - 2435.60] little bit of water too
[2433.52 - 2436.80] so a tablespoon of water one to three
[2435.60 - 2439.36] tablespoons of water
[2436.80 - 2442.56] let's put a little bit of that in there
[2439.36 - 2442.56] i'm gonna try to blend this up
[2444.32 - 2449.20] making the dressing for the salad so
[2446.24 - 2452.88] here's the salad if you guys look
[2449.20 - 2456.88] dr fan md
[2452.88 - 2456.88] yeah are cocaine leaves sustainable
[2459.52 - 2462.32] that's a good question
[2464.84 - 2467.84] dressing
[2480.65 - 2483.88] [Music]
[2484.64 - 2489.76] all right so i got a little ramekin here
[2488.88 - 2492.16] so
[2489.76 - 2494.32] i like my dressing on the side you can
[2492.16 - 2496.48] pour it on the salad if you like
[2494.32 - 2498.72] but i like my dressing on the side as i
[2496.48 - 2500.40] just spilled a little bit of it
[2498.72 - 2502.72] so i wanted to show you guys so i angled
[2500.40 - 2506.00] it your way see so that's the dressing
[2502.72 - 2506.00] right here um
[2506.88 - 2512.00] so i like the dressing
[2510.16 - 2514.00] seat in the front okay that's cool
[2512.00 - 2515.44] that's awesome right there
[2514.00 - 2516.56] you can pour a little bit on the sap you
[2515.44 - 2518.40] can pour it right over the salad it's
[2516.56 - 2520.24] perfectly fine
[2518.40 - 2522.08] what i do is i kind of like do that and
[2520.24 - 2523.68] i dip it into the dressing
[2522.08 - 2525.68] that's the way i do but everybody's got
[2523.68 - 2527.28] their own their own you know little
[2525.68 - 2530.32] thing that they do
[2527.28 - 2531.84] so so you know i want to talk
[2530.32 - 2533.68] you guys got a couple more minutes about
[2531.84 - 2534.56] that about this i want to talk about a
[2533.68 - 2535.52] little bit more about
[2534.56 - 2537.20] the things going out there with
[2535.52 - 2538.16] chocolate the things going on with
[2537.20 - 2540.24] women's health
[2538.16 - 2541.84] fragrances and stuff like that this is
[2540.24 - 2543.28] the strawberry banana salad
[2541.84 - 2545.28] just made it that's the butter leaf
[2543.28 - 2548.48] lettuce right there okay
[2545.28 - 2551.20] you see that um spinach okay
[2548.48 - 2551.88] spinach trace mineral salts for the
[2551.20 - 2553.52] brain
[2551.88 - 2555.28] neurotransmitters so your
[2553.52 - 2557.20] neurotransmitters they get dehydrated
[2555.28 - 2558.56] and they dry up so here's what happens
[2557.20 - 2559.76] everybody's doing their caffeine and you
[2558.56 - 2560.56] could do your caffeine you could do your
[2559.76 - 2562.24] chocolate i'm not
[2560.56 - 2564.00] picking on anybody here i'm just telling
[2562.24 - 2565.76] you what's happening so you know
[2564.00 - 2567.76] but when you when you do when you're
[2565.76 - 2570.40] when you're all cranked up
[2567.76 - 2572.48] on the caffeine what it's doing is it's
[2570.40 - 2575.36] burning out your neurotransmitters
[2572.48 - 2577.52] so those neurotransmitters are priceless
[2575.36 - 2579.28] those neurotransmitters are how you can
[2577.52 - 2580.96] think in the end how you could keep your
[2579.28 - 2582.56] brain alive long when you
[2580.96 - 2584.48] when you're older so you don't get
[2582.56 - 2587.92] alzheimer's you don't get dementia
[2584.48 - 2590.24] and caffeine is a fast track to dementia
[2587.92 - 2592.08] it's a fast track to alzheimer's because
[2590.24 - 2593.52] what the caffeine does is it cranks up
[2592.08 - 2595.12] your adrenals then your
[2593.52 - 2597.60] adrenals are pumping pump and pump and
[2595.12 - 2599.44] pump and pump in and that adrenaline
[2597.60 - 2601.12] scorches all your neurotransmitters
[2599.44 - 2602.32] inside your brain so your electrical
[2601.12 - 2603.60] impulses they need those
[2602.32 - 2604.88] neurotransmitters
[2603.60 - 2606.72] your neurons need those
[2604.88 - 2607.20] neurotransmitters your glial cells need
[2606.72 - 2609.20] those
[2607.20 - 2611.44] neurotransmitters and so what the
[2609.20 - 2613.68] caffeine does is it stimulates your
[2611.44 - 2615.84] adrenals your adrenals end up pumping in
[2613.68 - 2617.16] all that epinephrine the epinephrine
[2615.84 - 2618.40] just starts to eat away at your
[2617.16 - 2620.16] neurotransmitters
[2618.40 - 2622.64] and then you get that like you're in
[2620.16 - 2623.52] your 50s you're in your 60s and just
[2622.64 - 2624.72] like what
[2623.52 - 2626.40] and you just start forgetting like
[2624.72 - 2628.00] where's my car keys for the set for the
[2626.40 - 2629.36] 50th time
[2628.00 - 2631.36] wait a minute i don't think i could get
[2629.36 - 2632.48] my way home now i don't i think i'm lost
[2631.36 - 2635.04] on in the car
[2632.48 - 2636.56] like all that stuff starts happening and
[2635.04 - 2638.80] oh no one ever said
[2636.56 - 2640.16] 20 years of coffee could cause this no
[2638.80 - 2642.00] no one ever said
[2640.16 - 2644.40] you know all those years of chocolate
[2642.00 - 2646.32] caffeine coffee tea espresso
[2644.40 - 2647.68] is gonna burn out my neurotransmitters
[2646.32 - 2649.60] and then when you got the heavy metals
[2647.68 - 2650.48] in there it's worse worse worse makes it
[2649.60 - 2652.80] worse
[2650.48 - 2654.00] and and no one ever tells women that the
[2652.80 - 2655.84] reason why they're getting the hair
[2654.00 - 2658.00] thinning is from the caffeine use
[2655.84 - 2659.52] it's from the chocolate cacao it's from
[2658.00 - 2660.16] it's from the coffee it's from the
[2659.52 - 2663.20] espresso
[2660.16 - 2664.00] it's from the tea because women's
[2663.20 - 2667.20] adrenals
[2664.00 - 2669.20] have a hormone in that in that in that
[2667.20 - 2670.64] whole pocket of adrenaline in there how
[2669.20 - 2672.08] there's a special hormone that keeps
[2670.64 - 2674.40] hair on women's heads
[2672.08 - 2676.16] it's different than men women's health
[2674.40 - 2676.72] and men's health entirely two different
[2676.16 - 2679.12] things
[2676.72 - 2680.00] entirely two different things and no one
[2679.12 - 2682.16] thinks about that
[2680.00 - 2684.16] no one knows about that so it's like
[2682.16 - 2685.84] okay hey let's make sure we do all the
[2684.16 - 2687.36] caffeine we want to do but when your
[2685.84 - 2688.32] hair's thinning and falling out and
[2687.36 - 2690.72] you're getting all the
[2688.32 - 2692.16] patches and everything else and your
[2690.72 - 2694.56] hair is thinning and it's falling out in
[2692.16 - 2696.00] your hands and it's on the shower floor
[2694.56 - 2697.92] and no one's telling you it's from the
[2696.00 - 2699.04] five years of caffeine the seven years
[2697.92 - 2700.88] of caffeine
[2699.04 - 2702.64] 20 years of caffeine two years of
[2700.88 - 2704.24] caffeine no one's telling it
[2702.64 - 2705.68] and that's a whole other thing all on
[2704.24 - 2707.52] its own so it's one of the biggest
[2705.68 - 2709.92] contributors to women's hair thinning
[2707.52 - 2711.68] and hair loss is caffeine
[2709.92 - 2713.36] anyway why am i even talking about all
[2711.68 - 2714.72] this because i want you to be able to
[2713.36 - 2716.40] counter it because i'm not going to be
[2714.72 - 2717.84] able to get you off your caffeine
[2716.40 - 2718.96] i know that i'm probably not going to be
[2717.84 - 2720.56] able to get you off of him and some
[2718.96 - 2722.48] people i'll get him off of it
[2720.56 - 2724.16] but doesn't mean i'll be able to get you
[2722.48 - 2725.68] off with cacao does it mean i'll get you
[2724.16 - 2727.84] off of chocolate i mean what do i have
[2725.68 - 2730.00] to gain just eat it all you want right
[2727.84 - 2731.76] like what do i have to gain if you're
[2730.00 - 2733.44] jacked up on coffee every day and your
[2731.76 - 2734.88] adrenals are pumping and flooding and
[2733.44 - 2736.24] it's burning out your neurotransmitters
[2734.88 - 2737.84] like why should i care
[2736.24 - 2739.92] you could drink all the coffee you want
[2737.84 - 2741.36] all the tea you want all the espresso
[2739.92 - 2744.08] all the chocolate you want
[2741.36 - 2744.64] but i do care that's that's the problem
[2744.08 - 2746.64] i guess
[2744.64 - 2748.24] i actually do care so i want you to be
[2746.64 - 2748.80] able to counter it strawberry banana
[2748.24 - 2750.56] salad
[2748.80 - 2752.72] helps counter because i may not be able
[2750.56 - 2755.84] to get you off your caffeine
[2752.72 - 2757.84] but you can get the new addition
[2755.84 - 2759.60] you can learn how to make the strawberry
[2757.84 - 2762.40] banana salad
[2759.60 - 2763.84] and donna cuff says what an eye opener
[2762.40 - 2765.60] never heard this before
[2763.84 - 2767.12] thank you thank you for being here
[2765.60 - 2768.64] that's why you're on the medical medium
[2767.12 - 2769.60] channel because it's always advanced
[2768.64 - 2771.20] information
[2769.60 - 2772.64] it's been like that for years and years
[2771.20 - 2774.32] and years it's why doctors all around
[2772.64 - 2775.76] the world contact me want information
[2774.32 - 2776.96] for their patients it's why i'm well
[2775.76 - 2780.48] known to be the guy
[2776.96 - 2783.92] to have answers for bizarre symptoms and
[2780.48 - 2788.00] that's how we do it
[2783.92 - 2789.92] um so you know i put out the information
[2788.00 - 2792.24] people take it don't cite it back you
[2789.92 - 2795.28] know i put out the information about how
[2792.24 - 2797.68] lemon water okay
[2795.28 - 2799.52] 16 to 32 ounces first thing in the
[2797.68 - 2802.88] morning flushes your liver
[2799.52 - 2804.48] and flushes toxins out of your body and
[2802.88 - 2806.48] no one knew that they just thought lemon
[2804.48 - 2807.36] water was good for you that was it no
[2806.48 - 2810.00] one knew
[2807.36 - 2810.48] it flushed out your liver in the morning
[2810.00 - 2812.64] and
[2810.48 - 2814.56] but no one wants to cite that back
[2812.64 - 2816.16] that's 30 years of hard work but it
[2814.56 - 2818.96] doesn't matter it's about you guys
[2816.16 - 2820.08] getting your healing but you know what
[2818.96 - 2822.16] does matter
[2820.08 - 2824.00] when information's not cited back then
[2822.16 - 2825.60] someone can't find their way
[2824.00 - 2827.20] and figure out how to heal themselves
[2825.60 - 2829.28] from lyme disease
[2827.20 - 2830.72] no one can find their way to how to heal
[2829.28 - 2834.88] themselves from m e
[2830.72 - 2835.52] c f s lupus r a hashimoto's so i guess
[2834.88 - 2838.88] it really
[2835.52 - 2842.56] it does matter so you guys
[2838.88 - 2844.16] strawberry banana salad right here so
[2842.56 - 2846.24] what happens if people don't cite it
[2844.16 - 2847.68] back then people don't know where to go
[2846.24 - 2850.80] to heal
[2847.68 - 2852.00] and it keeps others from healing and
[2850.80 - 2853.84] that's on
[2852.00 - 2855.36] those people man the people that won't
[2853.84 - 2858.16] cite it back you want
[2855.36 - 2859.20] you want people to stay sick it's not
[2858.16 - 2861.84] fair
[2859.20 - 2862.56] um heavy metal detox smoothie i just saw
[2861.84 - 2863.84] that yeah
[2862.56 - 2866.00] you guys if you're doing a heavy metal
[2863.84 - 2869.36] detox smoothie don't just
[2866.00 - 2871.20] use any old spirulina any old barley
[2869.36 - 2872.08] grass i'll give you a couple of tips you
[2871.20 - 2874.72] don't want to use
[2872.08 - 2877.44] barley grass you're not going to get the
[2874.72 - 2880.08] metals out so you want barley grass
[2877.44 - 2881.44] juice powder that's the difference keep
[2880.08 - 2883.28] that in mind okay
[2881.44 - 2885.60] so that's the vimergy barley grass juice
[2883.28 - 2888.80] powder i'm not sponsored
[2885.60 - 2889.84] i don't own the company um but the
[2888.80 - 2891.52] stuff's that good
[2889.84 - 2893.28] it's what i take every day so i had my
[2891.52 - 2894.96] heavy metal detox movie this morning i
[2893.28 - 2898.00] used the vimergy barley grass
[2894.96 - 2900.00] juice powder seed juice powder
[2898.00 - 2901.60] and that's the best one vimergi visa and
[2900.00 - 2904.80] victor i m e r g
[2901.60 - 2906.48] y bimrg.com but that's
[2904.80 - 2908.48] what here the reason why i'm saying this
[2906.48 - 2910.08] is i saw the heavy metal detox smoothie
[2908.48 - 2911.84] someone say something about it and what
[2910.08 - 2913.60] people do is they use barley grass
[2911.84 - 2914.88] guess what the metals don't come out
[2913.60 - 2917.52] people don't get better
[2914.88 - 2918.40] because the mistake was made the details
[2917.52 - 2921.20] matter
[2918.40 - 2921.60] they matter same thing with spirulina
[2921.20 - 2924.48] like
[2921.60 - 2926.00] not all spirulinas are equal that's the
[2924.48 - 2928.16] one from vimergy that's the one that
[2926.00 - 2931.20] works in the heavy metal detox smoothie
[2928.16 - 2932.96] um details matter bottom line just
[2931.20 - 2934.88] letting you guys know
[2932.96 - 2936.32] so anyway when it comes down to taking
[2934.88 - 2939.44] care of yourself
[2936.32 - 2940.88] okay i basically want i was talking to
[2939.44 - 2943.60] this doctor the other day he said
[2940.88 - 2946.00] anthony i can't get everybody off
[2943.60 - 2946.96] the coffee i can't get everybody to stop
[2946.00 - 2948.24] eating chocolate
[2946.96 - 2950.00] they think the chocolate's good for them
[2948.24 - 2950.88] because they're told that it's good for
[2950.00 - 2953.76] you right
[2950.88 - 2955.20] he says i can't stop him so what do i do
[2953.76 - 2958.16] i said counter it man
[2955.20 - 2958.88] you got to counter it you can't stop
[2958.16 - 2960.56] people
[2958.88 - 2962.80] from hurting themselves because they've
[2960.56 - 2965.76] been brainwashed and they've been
[2962.80 - 2967.36] trained to hurt themselves so you can't
[2965.76 - 2971.12] you can't easily stop it
[2967.36 - 2973.36] right but maybe you can counter it
[2971.12 - 2974.32] is what you can do so i told this doctor
[2973.36 - 2976.08] look
[2974.32 - 2977.44] get them on this rubber banana salad
[2976.08 - 2979.76] because that's what i'm going to make
[2977.44 - 2982.08] when i do the live get them on the foods
[2979.76 - 2984.96] to counter it
[2982.08 - 2986.72] get them on the strawberries get them on
[2984.96 - 2990.08] all that good stuff
[2986.72 - 2992.48] and so it's important um you guys
