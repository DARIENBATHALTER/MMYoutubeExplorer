[0.88 - 6.00] we're live right now live on facebook
[3.60 - 7.12] live on youtube live on tick tock live
[6.00 - 9.28] on clubhouse
[7.12 - 10.16] we're doing immune system building this
[9.28 - 12.16] is a critical
[10.16 - 13.84] critical live right here you might want
[12.16 - 15.44] to take notes
[13.84 - 16.96] because it's that important medical
[15.44 - 19.76] medium information was always about
[16.96 - 21.36] rebuilding the immune system medical
[19.76 - 23.44] medium information
[21.36 - 25.12] was the only that knew about all the
[23.44 - 27.52] different viruses
[25.12 - 29.36] of the epstein-barr sediment virus what
[27.52 - 31.60] people were up against with shingles
[29.36 - 34.00] what the symptoms are relating to these
[31.60 - 35.28] viruses which was never known as far as
[34.00 - 37.68] symptoms
[35.28 - 39.68] and how to protect ourselves including
[37.68 - 41.60] the flu viruses
[39.68 - 44.56] and other bugs like that too so really
[41.60 - 46.64] important also mm info
[44.56 - 48.56] let everybody know how to protect their
[46.64 - 52.08] immune system originally
[48.56 - 53.84] before the plague and i talked about
[52.08 - 55.76] and right actually during the place and
[53.84 - 57.12] i talked about the new edition
[55.76 - 58.80] medical medium new edition right here
[57.12 - 60.56] revised and expanded
[58.80 - 62.16] i talked about that information about
[60.56 - 62.96] the plague we're up against now and how
[62.16 - 66.24] it works and
[62.96 - 68.48] how that instigates the epstein bar
[66.24 - 70.48] and causes these epstein bars to come
[68.48 - 71.36] out other viruses to come out too so
[70.48 - 72.00] we're talking about rebuilding the
[71.36 - 75.44] immune system
[72.00 - 78.08] i'm making thyme tea time water
[75.44 - 78.80] i'm doing the zinc shock therapy vitamin
[78.08 - 80.80] c
[78.80 - 82.32] shock therapy i'm also going to juice a
[80.80 - 84.08] little celery juice because he can't
[82.32 - 86.80] underestimate the power of
[84.08 - 88.40] that humble herb so let's get going you
[86.80 - 90.08] guys we're live on tick tock
[88.40 - 92.88] we're live on youtube we're live on
[90.08 - 94.96] facebook live on clubhouse right now
[92.88 - 96.56] good to see you guys honored you're all
[94.96 - 98.72] coming on and uh
[96.56 - 100.72] incredible you know this is this is an
[98.72 - 102.32] important and poor i mean i'm not saying
[100.72 - 103.36] that the other lives aren't important
[102.32 - 104.88] you guys
[103.36 - 106.72] i'm not saying that they are they're
[104.88 - 110.16] always packed with information right
[106.72 - 112.16] and but this one right here is
[110.16 - 113.52] you know i every now and then time
[112.16 - 115.60] passes and i
[113.52 - 117.28] too much time passes i feel and i don't
[115.60 - 118.96] cover it with you guys again i'm like
[117.28 - 120.56] wait a minute i think everybody's doing
[118.96 - 122.64] their immune system building
[120.56 - 124.72] i think they're doing their zing i think
[122.64 - 125.68] they're doing their golden seal i think
[124.72 - 127.36] they're doing
[125.68 - 129.68] their lemon balm i think they're doing
[127.36 - 132.32] their time t but they're not
[129.68 - 133.92] not everybody right and just some people
[132.32 - 136.56] and it's like okay well
[133.92 - 138.32] when it comes down to immune system
[136.56 - 140.00] that's how we can protect ourselves but
[138.32 - 141.92] it's not just about
[140.00 - 143.92] taking things to do that it's about
[141.92 - 145.36] knowing why it happens you guys like on
[143.92 - 148.08] tick tock i'm telling you now
[145.36 - 149.04] it's important to know how zinc works in
[148.08 - 151.60] your system
[149.04 - 152.48] how it makes the bugs the pathogens the
[151.60 - 155.68] viruses
[152.48 - 156.64] docile that's important and then we lose
[155.68 - 158.24] all our zinc
[156.64 - 160.08] people don't have zinc in their bodies
[158.24 - 161.28] they don't have it there it's a critical
[160.08 - 162.80] trace mineral
[161.28 - 164.88] and the reason why they don't have it
[162.80 - 167.04] there it's not in your food
[164.88 - 169.04] it's not in your food some will say
[167.04 - 170.00] oysters oysters eat some oysters to get
[169.04 - 172.32] your zinc are you kidding
[170.00 - 173.92] me you're gonna get more mercury than
[172.32 - 176.48] you are if anything
[173.92 - 177.76] abby said this shock therapy really
[176.48 - 179.92] works
[177.76 - 180.80] uh oh my god you've done it so you've
[179.92 - 184.16] done the zinc
[180.80 - 185.68] one using vimergy's ink a few times
[184.16 - 187.20] even when you feel a sore throat coming
[185.68 - 188.64] on and it works that's that's the whole
[187.20 - 190.08] point it's about
[188.64 - 192.00] when you feel that sore throat coming on
[190.08 - 194.00] and everything too um
[192.00 - 196.08] the only one that i've ever used for
[194.00 - 197.04] that i trust is the vimergi zinc right
[196.08 - 198.96] there that's the one
[197.04 - 200.56] so if you guys want to know i'm not
[198.96 - 203.20] sponsored but it's the one
[200.56 - 204.48] that i feel works for my family and for
[203.20 - 206.80] my friends
[204.48 - 208.32] um so yeah so it's really cool zinc
[206.80 - 209.36] shock therapy i'm going to do in a
[208.32 - 211.12] couple of minutes we're going to do a
[209.36 - 213.36] little bit of that

[241.68 - 245.44] where did it come from am i a genius is
[244.16 - 248.56] that where it came from
[245.44 - 250.96] medical medium is a genius no
[248.56 - 252.72] medium is not a genius i told you there
[250.96 - 256.40] is medical medium a doctor
[252.72 - 260.08] is a is he a doctor a genius doctor no
[256.40 - 261.12] i'm not uh but doctors use medical meme
[260.08 - 263.76] information they've
[261.12 - 264.40] asked my help for many decades doing
[263.76 - 267.12] this work
[264.40 - 268.80] where does the information come from it
[267.12 - 270.88] comes from above
[268.80 - 271.92] where else does this information how
[270.88 - 274.56] else would you
[271.92 - 275.44] know about the fact that they're
[274.56 - 278.88] literally
[275.44 - 280.16] bleeding you to death that's not because
[278.88 - 282.08] i'm a genius
[280.16 - 284.48] no i've always said i'm not that smart
[282.08 - 286.24] of a guy i'm not a smart guy
[284.48 - 287.92] athena marie zinc shock therapy and
[286.24 - 291.36] vitamin c shock therapy
[287.92 - 292.48] saves us every time knocks anything out
[291.36 - 295.52] fast
[292.48 - 297.76] it just does right but
[295.52 - 298.56] where would i get that information you
[297.76 - 301.68] guys me
[298.56 - 304.32] uh so mika says used to have sore throat
[301.68 - 305.52] my whole childhood zinc helps it stop
[304.32 - 307.92] throat pain
[305.52 - 309.60] on the first day yeah it's just it's so
[307.92 - 313.12] important right
[309.60 - 315.12] so you know uh a genius lori says yes no
[313.12 - 316.40] no not a genius no no no no no
[315.12 - 319.36] definitely not
[316.40 - 320.00] uh gozak says shock therapies are great
[319.36 - 322.64] both
[320.00 - 324.16] work vimergy has a great quality
[322.64 - 327.20] absolutely because you're not going to
[324.16 - 328.08] the vimorgy the vimergy zinc right and
[327.20 - 329.20] the vitamin c
[328.08 - 330.56] like with the zinc you're not going to
[329.20 - 331.92] get those natural flavors not going to
[330.56 - 332.96] get citric acid not going to get the
[331.92 - 333.36] alcohol you're not going to get any of
[332.96 - 335.28] that
[333.36 - 337.28] jackie says my husband and i did zinc
[335.28 - 340.24] and vitamin c shock therapy
[337.28 - 341.12] and it worked within 24 hours we're
[340.24 - 342.56] going to do we're going to show
[341.12 - 343.76] everybody about the zinc shock therapy
[342.56 - 346.80] in a minute too
[343.76 - 348.32] um and so someone might say hey you know
[346.80 - 349.28] there's other zincs out there there's
[348.32 - 352.16] other things like
[349.28 - 353.28] liquid sulfates right but what people
[352.16 - 356.32] don't realize
[353.28 - 358.08] is those aren't stabilized they're not
[356.32 - 359.68] stabilized and that's the difference
[358.08 - 362.24] between vimergy's
[359.68 - 364.00] zinc versus somebody else's zinc the
[362.24 - 367.20] other zincs aren't stable
[364.00 - 369.20] and that's the problem um but where
[367.20 - 371.36] would i get the information you guys
[369.20 - 372.72] where would it come from right how would
[371.36 - 375.44] i know
[372.72 - 377.44] that they're just taking all your blood
[375.44 - 379.28] and all they need is a tiny drop
[377.44 - 380.80] right but no one's talked about it in
[379.28 - 382.32] all of the medical fields no one's
[380.80 - 383.44] talked about an alternative medicine no
[382.32 - 385.04] one caught it
[383.44 - 386.56] how would i know that people go
[385.04 - 387.92] backwards and go backwards and go
[386.56 - 388.88] backwards with their healing they don't
[387.92 - 390.48] even heal
[388.88 - 392.08] and that if you have lyme disease
[390.48 - 393.20] they'll take so much blood from you if
[392.08 - 395.04] you have lupus they'll take so much
[393.20 - 396.08] blood for it the ms will take so much
[395.04 - 397.60] blood cancer
[396.08 - 399.36] and they'll send you backwards and
[397.60 - 399.92] remove your immune system is am i a
[399.36 - 402.24] genius
[399.92 - 403.04] is that where it comes from no i'm not a
[402.24 - 404.72] genius
[403.04 - 406.64] it comes from the information i told you
[404.72 - 408.64] that it all comes from you guys it comes
[406.64 - 411.76] from above since age four
[408.64 - 414.72] right and if you can get past
[411.76 - 415.20] the fact that i hear a voice since age
[414.72 - 419.04] four
[415.20 - 422.64] giving us advanced medical information
[419.04 - 425.92] then you are open to the tools to heal
[422.64 - 428.24] you are open to it you are free to heal
[425.92 - 429.28] right you can you can just you can move
[428.24 - 431.28] forward and heal
[429.28 - 433.20] you know you have a friend of mine that
[431.28 - 434.64] is a doctor you became a new friend of
[433.20 - 435.84] mine pretty recently he says you know i
[434.64 - 436.64] always wanted to talk to you it's been
[435.84 - 439.12] years and years
[436.64 - 440.56] been wanting to talk to you and and uh
[439.12 - 441.76] never had the chance you know and
[440.56 - 443.52] finally get a chance and
[441.76 - 445.28] it took me a while to get past the whole
[443.52 - 447.44] thing where you get your information
[445.28 - 449.28] but you've saved so many lives and i've
[447.44 - 450.00] heard it from so many doctors now all
[449.28 - 452.08] around and i've heard
[450.00 - 453.76] about also a lot of jealous doctors that
[452.08 - 455.12] that don't like you because they're
[453.76 - 456.64] tired of hearing your name from all
[455.12 - 457.28] their patients bringing in the books and
[456.64 - 460.72] stuff
[457.28 - 462.96] and he said but it works and and i don't
[460.72 - 465.12] care where the information comes from
[462.96 - 466.80] eliza said got very bad allergic
[465.12 - 470.08] reaction to supplement
[466.80 - 472.80] yeah you did not recommend buying now
[470.08 - 473.60] only the ones you are recommending i
[472.80 - 474.96] mean
[473.60 - 477.44] there are zincs out there that have all
[474.96 - 479.60] the citric acid in there it's terrifying
[477.44 - 482.00] just burn a hole in your throat right
[479.60 - 483.44] there's there's tinctures out there and
[482.00 - 485.92] all the alcohol right
[483.44 - 487.12] you know back it still happens now
[485.92 - 489.44] people like people like
[487.12 - 491.68] do medical medium and do this other
[489.44 - 493.84] person's stuff right they're all because
[491.68 - 495.04] they're paid to say this stuff and the
[493.84 - 496.40] other person's stuff
[495.04 - 498.24] has all this alcohol and all the
[496.40 - 500.08] tinctures their golden seal has alcohol
[498.24 - 501.12] in it their tinctures all have alcohol
[500.08 - 502.96] in it right
[501.12 - 504.56] and then you got to be careful with the
[502.96 - 506.72] in the herbal world because in the
[504.56 - 509.12] herbal world what will happen
[506.72 - 510.56] okay which works against your immune
[509.12 - 512.88] system you guys
[510.56 - 514.08] against your immune system what happens
[512.88 - 515.84] in the herbal world
[514.08 - 517.68] right is they got all these tinctures
[515.84 - 519.60] and and someone just says let's just
[517.68 - 520.48] throw 20 different herbs in this
[519.60 - 523.20] tincture
[520.48 - 524.48] you're getting that much herb like that
[523.20 - 526.80] much herb
[524.48 - 528.72] that's all you're getting that much herb
[526.80 - 530.64] i mean not even a speck
[528.72 - 532.64] and then it's an alcohol right it's an
[530.64 - 533.60] alcohol it's not an immune system
[532.64 - 536.64] builder
[533.60 - 538.88] their immune system breakers you know so
[536.64 - 540.56] it really matters supplementation it
[538.88 - 542.64] matters like what kind you're doing it
[540.56 - 545.52] matters about understanding it
[542.64 - 546.72] all these things it just this this is
[545.52 - 548.24] make or break
[546.72 - 550.08] you know you get your blood draws you

[627.04 - 629.20] gonna do it this way with this tea
[628.40 - 632.32] kettle
[629.20 - 635.60] right uh paula on tick tock
[632.32 - 637.12] these lives keep me on track incredible
[635.60 - 638.80] i'm honored you're here paula thank you
[637.12 - 643.04] for coming here
[638.80 - 643.04] incredible and
[643.44 - 647.20] so divine light says also the zinc shock
[646.08 - 649.44] therapy
[647.20 - 654.08] has saved me so many times it
[649.44 - 654.08] immediately takes the sore throat away
[654.16 - 658.72] nobody knew about that that could even
[656.40 - 662.48] work that that can even be an option
[658.72 - 665.36] you can go to a thousand doctors
[662.48 - 666.16] in your lifetime with autoimmune and
[665.36 - 669.52] everything
[666.16 - 672.96] a thousand doctors and not
[669.52 - 674.08] have that information think about how
[672.96 - 676.08] valuable
[674.08 - 677.28] that piece of information is i'm
[676.08 - 679.04] teaching doctors that piece of
[677.28 - 680.08] information but think about how valuable
[679.04 - 683.04] that is
[680.08 - 683.76] that it makes the sore throat go away
[683.04 - 686.32] you know
[683.76 - 687.52] and that's not all it does though too so
[686.32 - 689.84] okay
[687.52 - 691.68] um we're gonna do i got some tea right
[689.84 - 692.80] here so i'm gonna take some sprigs of
[691.68 - 695.20] thyme
[692.80 - 697.28] right you can do two sprigs of time what
[695.20 - 698.48] i really love about this okay and i'm
[697.28 - 701.04] gonna
[698.48 - 702.00] kind of bunch it up so the sprigs guys i
[701.04 - 703.76] got fresh thyme right
[702.00 - 705.84] here okay i'm gonna bunch it up a little
[703.76 - 707.60] bit like that let me see here there you
[705.84 - 710.40] go i want to turn this around
[707.60 - 711.04] make a nice little what two sprigs this
[710.40 - 713.76] is like
[711.04 - 715.28] yeah this is more than two two sprigs
[713.76 - 718.00] but i'm showing you that you can do
[715.28 - 720.08] more than the two sprigs is a minimum
[718.00 - 721.68] it's got to be minimum two sprigs right
[720.08 - 723.76] so i'm putting these sprigs down in here
[721.68 - 727.12] like that okay
[723.76 - 729.20] so i'm gonna actually um i place the
[727.12 - 731.68] fresh thyme in the mug
[729.20 - 732.88] i'm gonna pour water in here now hot
[731.68 - 736.16] water
[732.88 - 740.08] okay we're gonna talk about this time
[736.16 - 742.80] tea all right and i'm gonna steep it for
[740.08 - 744.32] 15 minutes
[742.80 - 747.28] and as i'm steeping it we're going to
[744.32 - 748.64] talk about how incredible it is
[747.28 - 750.80] sound good and i'm going to answer
[748.64 - 752.56] questions too possibly
[750.80 - 754.08] yeah it's the vimorgy's ink on tick tock
[752.56 - 757.12] that's the one right there
[754.08 - 760.56] v is in victor i m as in mary ergy dot

[768.64 - 772.72] strep throat
[770.00 - 773.84] since doing zinc shock therapy no more
[772.72 - 777.04] meds for four
[773.84 - 780.40] years is that valuable
[777.04 - 781.92] is that worth anything is it
[780.40 - 784.08] the trolls to think it's not worth
[781.92 - 785.28] anything you know people think it's not
[784.08 - 788.56] worth anything that's worth
[785.28 - 790.00] everything everything
[788.56 - 792.40] i mean that's a lot of struggle and
[790.00 - 794.40] suffering all the doctors visits give me
[792.40 - 795.52] the antibiotics give me the antibiotics
[794.40 - 796.96] that's what happens
[795.52 - 799.52] it's like you got the strep throat
[796.96 - 801.28] coming back boom doctor's office more
[799.52 - 804.64] antibiotics and guess what

[808.56 - 811.20] sore throat strep throat more
[809.84 - 814.00] antibiotics

[824.16 - 828.96] back to bladder infections back this is
[826.56 - 831.44] how it works right
[828.96 - 832.88] and so and then more more antibiotics
[831.44 - 834.56] and more antibiotics
[832.88 - 836.16] right so we're going to talk about the
[834.56 - 838.32] time in a second i just saw somebody ask
[836.16 - 840.00] about that on tic tac
[838.32 - 842.24] so we're going to also get some time
[840.00 - 843.36] infused water going so i got the thyme
[842.24 - 846.88] infused
[843.36 - 850.16] tea which is a medical medium tool right
[846.88 - 852.16] proud to say it is truly
[850.16 - 854.16] because of how many people it has helped
[852.16 - 854.72] and from where the information comes
[854.16 - 856.72] from
[854.72 - 858.80] i'm steeping it for 15 minutes so you
[856.72 - 860.24] know we might not be on that exact 15
[858.80 - 861.84] minute mark it could be a little after
[860.24 - 863.68] whatever happens naturally
[861.84 - 866.16] because we're live right here this is in
[863.68 - 868.96] a studio recording where
[866.16 - 870.56] everything's picture perfect right time
[868.96 - 872.48] infused water but first of all i have to
[870.56 - 874.88] infuse the time water that's number one
[872.48 - 878.80] so i'm gonna put sprigs in here now
[874.88 - 879.84] um and i'm gonna soak the sprigs in here
[878.80 - 882.24] so that's what we're gonna do we're
[879.84 - 883.60] gonna be putting fresh sprigs you soak
[882.24 - 886.56] it overnight
[883.60 - 889.44] in a pitcher of room temperature water
[886.56 - 889.44] so we'll do that
[890.16 - 894.08] let's get the i'm turning the sprigs
[891.76 - 897.36] around a little bit
[894.08 - 899.36] there we go got my sprigs ready right

[908.32 - 912.08] let's cut a lemon i don't know why i
[909.68 - 915.44] have to throw everything in the air
[912.08 - 915.84] what i do put a little bit of lemon in
[915.44 - 917.92] there
[915.84 - 919.36] not yet though let me just hold off for
[917.92 - 919.84] a second let me just get this thing

[931.12 - 934.88] lemon slices let me do a couple of
[932.80 - 937.36] slices of lemon how about that
[934.88 - 938.56] let's drop those in there nice looks
[937.36 - 942.48] amazing
[938.56 - 942.48] all right let's get that going there
[942.72 - 946.40] this is a great thing you know people
[944.88 - 948.24] are worried right now they're worried

[976.64 - 982.00] do for exposure
[978.32 - 985.04] okay and what i'll tell you what
[982.00 - 987.12] i'm doing about
[985.04 - 988.32] something about exposure so let me tell
[987.12 - 991.68] you what i'm doing
[988.32 - 993.04] okay i'm doing the time that's what i'm
[991.68 - 995.60] doing
[993.04 - 997.60] and if i get exposed to someone i might
[995.60 - 999.92] even do a little zing shot therapy
[997.60 - 1001.28] or definitely some vitamin c shock
[999.92 - 1003.44] therapy right
[1001.28 - 1005.52] that's what i'm doing just letting you
[1003.44 - 1008.96] know and
[1005.52 - 1010.16] i have i have two of these in my fridge
[1008.96 - 1013.52] right now
[1010.16 - 1014.96] right here soaking away so i drink the
[1013.52 - 1018.72] time infused water
[1014.96 - 1019.76] all day long for exposure time is more
[1018.72 - 1023.12] powerful
[1019.76 - 1025.04] than any other trendy idea
[1023.12 - 1026.48] that's starting to come out about
[1025.04 - 1028.08] exposure
[1026.48 - 1029.76] and i'm not going to try to rip apart
[1028.08 - 1031.52] that idea or anything or debunk it right
[1029.76 - 1034.24] now or anything like that
[1031.52 - 1035.52] but it doesn't work this is what i
[1034.24 - 1038.80] prepared everybody for
[1035.52 - 1041.28] all along that's the whole point and
[1038.80 - 1042.00] it doesn't have to come out now it's
[1041.28 - 1043.76] been out
[1042.00 - 1045.60] i've been already ahead of the curve
[1043.76 - 1047.36] making sure you were prepared
[1045.60 - 1049.60] so you had that health with liz you love
[1047.36 - 1052.80] the time t incredible
[1049.60 - 1054.32] so um but everybody's in a panic right
[1052.80 - 1055.60] now not everybody but a lot of people
[1054.32 - 1058.96] are in a panic right now
[1055.60 - 1060.48] yeah exactly on tick-tock and
[1058.96 - 1063.04] they're in a panic right now what do i
[1060.48 - 1066.08] do about exposure about something
[1063.04 - 1069.36] and so the time is where
[1066.08 - 1073.28] that viral exposure lies
[1069.36 - 1076.88] that's where the anti-viral nature
[1073.28 - 1080.08] for exposure is it's in the time water
[1076.88 - 1083.68] it's in the time t i talked about
[1080.08 - 1085.92] how the flues the plaguing flues
[1083.68 - 1086.80] knock down everybody's immune system
[1085.92 - 1089.20] causing
[1086.80 - 1091.68] other things to come up which is the
[1089.20 - 1093.36] epstein-barr the shingles the hhv-6 the
[1091.68 - 1094.24] cytomegalovirus the simplex one to
[1093.36 - 1097.84] simplex 2

[1100.80 - 1106.72] the different herpetic strains
[1102.80 - 1109.68] and viruses and varieties right and so
[1106.72 - 1110.56] and i have pandemic information in

[1125.44 - 1129.92] over a year ago like well over a year
[1127.92 - 1130.24] ago making sure you guys were prepared
[1129.92 - 1133.52] for
[1130.24 - 1136.96] that flu storm for that
[1133.52 - 1138.40] whole plague for that pandemic right off
[1136.96 - 1141.52] the running
[1138.40 - 1144.96] and i did i did instagram lives
[1141.52 - 1146.88] facebook lives in january
[1144.96 - 1149.04] going all the way back not this january
[1146.88 - 1151.68] the january before this january
[1149.04 - 1152.80] that would just pass so but then you
[1151.68 - 1154.56] know what happens is
[1152.80 - 1156.40] then this kind of silly stuff occurs
[1154.56 - 1158.24] right and people are like
[1156.40 - 1160.00] all of a sudden they're they're chasing
[1158.24 - 1161.44] once again the gay guessing game so
[1160.00 - 1162.64] they're chasing the guessing games
[1161.44 - 1163.68] because of exposure that's what's
[1162.64 - 1166.32] happening right now
[1163.68 - 1167.76] so once again guessing games right
[1166.32 - 1169.36] that's how it works
[1167.76 - 1172.40] meanwhile you don't have to have the
[1169.36 - 1175.28] guessing game that's the whole point
[1172.40 - 1177.44] you don't have to have it yes uh betty
[1175.28 - 1181.28] says and given us a whole pdf
[1177.44 - 1185.04] with healing tools exactly exactly
[1181.28 - 1188.40] and that pdf by the way betty that pdf
[1185.04 - 1191.84] went viral it completely
[1188.40 - 1192.56] covered the planet viral i can't even
[1191.84 - 1195.60] imagine
[1192.56 - 1198.08] how many you guys how many people had
[1195.60 - 1201.36] that pdf around the planet
[1198.08 - 1201.68] and so medical media put the tools out
[1201.36 - 1204.00] there
[1201.68 - 1205.44] so the guessing games wouldn't have to
[1204.00 - 1208.00] be there but then
[1205.44 - 1208.64] all of a sudden let's get a new silly
[1208.00 - 1210.56] trend
[1208.64 - 1211.76] let's get a new guessing game out there
[1210.56 - 1213.20] for people who are worried about
[1211.76 - 1216.88] exposure
[1213.20 - 1219.12] and meanwhile it's like what uh huh okay
[1216.88 - 1220.32] all right use something that doesn't
[1219.12 - 1222.40] work go ahead

[1222.40 - 1225.04] know what you'll end up using medical
[1223.92 - 1226.24] medium tools
[1225.04 - 1227.76] so we're talking about the zinc shock
[1226.24 - 1229.12] therapy talking about vitamin c shock
[1227.76 - 1230.40] therapy we're doing the time infused
[1229.12 - 1232.24] water we're doing the time
[1230.40 - 1234.16] t that's what we have you guys we're
[1232.24 - 1236.24] live right now as you know and tick tock
[1234.16 - 1237.76] facebook we're live on youtube we're
[1236.24 - 1240.24] live on clubhouse
[1237.76 - 1241.76] let's talk about the benefits so so what
[1240.24 - 1245.84] i love about time is
[1241.76 - 1249.12] time okay time hangs in the bloodstream
[1245.84 - 1252.00] it stays in the bloodstream okay because
[1249.12 - 1253.84] you can take an herb it doesn't mean
[1252.00 - 1254.96] it's going to stay in the bloodstream
[1253.84 - 1257.36] it doesn't mean it's going to stay in
[1254.96 - 1261.12] there long you have to
[1257.36 - 1263.76] have something in the bloodstream
[1261.12 - 1264.88] that's working for you that's the key
[1263.76 - 1266.64] okay
[1264.88 - 1268.16] and that's the most important place
[1266.64 - 1270.72] right there it has to be
[1268.16 - 1271.76] the bloodstream right so what time does
[1270.72 - 1274.64] is it hangs
[1271.76 - 1275.44] it doesn't go away it doesn't go way
[1274.64 - 1277.12] easy
[1275.44 - 1278.72] so what i like to do is i like to drink
[1277.12 - 1280.88] it on and off all day
[1278.72 - 1282.64] so that if i didn't drink it the next
[1280.88 - 1283.44] day or didn't drink it the day after the
[1282.64 - 1286.24] next day
[1283.44 - 1287.36] it was still in my system so it stays in
[1286.24 - 1289.84] your bloodstream
[1287.36 - 1290.64] for a good couple days lucy good to see
[1289.84 - 1293.44] you today
[1290.64 - 1295.60] on saturday yeah can we do the time t
[1293.44 - 1297.52] during the advanced 369 yes you can

[1297.52 - 1302.72] lissy definitely you can
[1299.52 - 1306.16] right and so what i like about the time
[1302.72 - 1307.92] is it has an everlasting like effect
[1306.16 - 1310.32] is what it does right it's the gift that
[1307.92 - 1312.24] keeps on giving so it's not like a lot
[1310.32 - 1313.76] of herbs a lot of herbs you've got like
[1312.24 - 1315.44] a half a day in there
[1313.76 - 1317.28] that's what you have a lot of herbs you
[1315.44 - 1319.44] got one day in there
[1317.28 - 1321.52] and that's just naturally how it works
[1319.44 - 1323.52] the herbs can still be amazing
[1321.52 - 1325.92] still be incredible like goldenseal
[1323.52 - 1328.96] goldenseal is a one-dayer
[1325.92 - 1330.96] that's a one-dayer right still critical
[1328.96 - 1332.64] still critical for the immune system
[1330.96 - 1334.48] still really is really important that's
[1332.64 - 1337.68] the bemidji golden seal right
[1334.48 - 1339.04] um and so um and i'm not sponsored but
[1337.68 - 1341.04] it's the stuff i use
[1339.04 - 1342.24] all the time so i use gold and seal all
[1341.04 - 1343.76] the time if i think i got a little
[1342.24 - 1344.80] exposure boom i'm down in a bunch of
[1343.76 - 1346.80] goldenseal
[1344.80 - 1348.64] that's what i do i think i got a little
[1346.80 - 1352.32] exposure boom get down again
[1348.64 - 1355.12] so that's a one dayer well
[1352.32 - 1355.68] the time which i love about it is it
[1355.12 - 1358.48] hangs
[1355.68 - 1360.40] it's got hang time it's got shelf life
[1358.48 - 1363.28] inside your bloodstream
[1360.40 - 1365.12] shelf life inside your body and then if
[1363.28 - 1367.44] we can't if we don't keep up on it
[1365.12 - 1368.64] it's still protecting us so two days
[1367.44 - 1370.72] later
[1368.64 - 1371.84] time is still floating around our
[1370.72 - 1373.20] bloodstream
[1371.84 - 1375.36] that's what i love about it now what
[1373.20 - 1378.04] does time do
[1375.36 - 1380.16] it basically what time does it's a
[1378.04 - 1382.88] disinfectant
[1380.16 - 1384.56] to pathogens pathogens hate
[1382.88 - 1386.16] disinfectants
[1384.56 - 1388.40] and that's what they despise one of the
[1386.16 - 1391.64] things they despise the most right
[1388.40 - 1393.60] so not just pathogens but pathogen
[1391.64 - 1397.04] byproducts
[1393.60 - 1400.48] viral byproducts viral star
[1397.04 - 1402.48] dust okay because you know
[1400.48 - 1404.72] viruses leave a path of all kinds of
[1402.48 - 1406.24] debris and all kinds of crap
[1404.72 - 1408.48] and all kinds of garbage not just
[1406.24 - 1411.68] neurotoxins and dermatoxins
[1408.48 - 1413.76] a byproduct of all kinds and so
[1411.68 - 1415.60] all that stuff builds up in a lymphatic
[1413.76 - 1417.12] system builds up in our liver it builds
[1415.60 - 1419.04] up in our bloodstream
[1417.12 - 1421.12] and time is this disinfectant that's
[1419.04 - 1422.64] doing some cleaning in our system
[1421.12 - 1424.32] that's what's so incredible about it
[1422.64 - 1426.56] right and
[1424.32 - 1428.32] yeah viral dust you like that one
[1426.56 - 1430.40] michelle i mean that's what it is
[1428.32 - 1431.36] okay see we hear hero time after time
[1430.40 - 1433.44] good song
[1431.36 - 1435.20] and so what i really love about it is
[1433.44 - 1437.04] you have to just remember hey i'm doing
[1435.20 - 1437.44] my time water i'm doing my time infused
[1437.04 - 1439.84] tea
[1437.44 - 1440.88] water what is it doing for me it's an
[1439.84 - 1444.88] antiseptic
[1440.88 - 1448.80] okay pathogens are allergic viruses
[1444.88 - 1452.08] are allergic to the oil in time
[1448.80 - 1455.68] okay so time has this really
[1452.08 - 1457.76] um thin thin thin oil
[1455.68 - 1459.20] is what time actually has so it's a va
[1457.76 - 1461.12] there's fat in everything i told you
[1459.20 - 1463.04] guys there's fat in every single herb
[1461.12 - 1464.48] this is why i try to keep your fats down
[1463.04 - 1466.88] with all your foods
[1464.48 - 1468.72] your overt fats down i'm trying to keep
[1466.88 - 1471.12] all your overt fats down
[1468.72 - 1473.20] because we're we're hurting ourselves
[1471.12 - 1474.96] with all that fat we do constantly over
[1473.20 - 1477.28] and over and over again right
[1474.96 - 1478.24] and that all that fat from overt fat
[1477.28 - 1479.84] stops
[1478.24 - 1481.28] things from working for you in other
[1479.84 - 1482.40] ways and i've talked about that because
[1481.28 - 1483.92] your bloodstream
[1482.40 - 1485.12] and i'll go into that in a second though
[1483.92 - 1486.16] what happens in your bloodstream with
[1485.12 - 1490.16] all the fats
[1486.16 - 1493.36] but time okay time oil
[1490.16 - 1497.36] which is an omega-3 in time
[1493.36 - 1498.64] itself right is an antiseptic too so
[1497.36 - 1502.08] that right there it's
[1498.64 - 1505.76] it's the one of the only fats
[1502.08 - 1508.32] there are that propel viruses
[1505.76 - 1509.60] it's in time so you can't just drink
[1508.32 - 1512.24] some olive oil i'm going to repel some
[1509.60 - 1513.76] viruses no your viruses will get worse
[1512.24 - 1515.52] can't just eat some more chicken getting
[1513.76 - 1516.96] all that chicken fat thinking that the
[1515.52 - 1517.68] fat's going to repel viruses no your
[1516.96 - 1519.76] virus is getting
[1517.68 - 1521.44] worse can't just eat your eggs i'll just
[1519.76 - 1522.56] feed the viruses straight out
[1521.44 - 1524.08] you can't just do a whole bunch of
[1522.56 - 1525.60] peanut butter well you know what there's
[1524.08 - 1527.04] there's some omegas in peanut butter
[1525.60 - 1527.60] there's a magazine walnuts there's a
[1527.04 - 1529.76] mega
[1527.60 - 1531.92] magazine in pumpkin seeds there's a
[1529.76 - 1535.04] magazine you know and
[1531.92 - 1536.72] chia seed so i use thyme essential oil
[1535.04 - 1537.44] every day topically but i am going to
[1536.72 - 1540.16] make the tea
[1537.44 - 1541.68] too i mean if you want to use thyme
[1540.16 - 1544.00] essential oil topically
[1541.68 - 1545.28] right you can but it's it's not going to
[1544.00 - 1547.92] stop exposure
[1545.28 - 1549.44] so you can't use time for exposure well
[1547.92 - 1551.12] the thing is with that is you might be
[1549.44 - 1553.52] able to use it on your hand maybe
[1551.12 - 1554.40] right and then if you were exposed to
[1553.52 - 1556.24] something
[1554.40 - 1558.08] in your hand like you grab the shopping
[1556.24 - 1560.32] cart that could help a little bit so
[1558.08 - 1562.72] that does help a little bit
[1560.32 - 1563.44] but internally though it has to be like
[1562.72 - 1565.20] the time t
[1563.44 - 1567.36] time infused water that's where it
[1565.20 - 1571.28] really kicks in inside the body
[1567.36 - 1574.48] but it's that that it's that micro oil
[1571.28 - 1576.32] micro omega oil that's in time but
[1574.48 - 1578.16] it's not in anywhere else you eat a
[1576.32 - 1580.08] bunch of hemp seeds you eat your peanut
[1578.16 - 1581.68] butter you eat your walnuts you eat your
[1580.08 - 1584.24] almonds
[1581.68 - 1584.88] that fat doesn't repel any viruses or
[1584.24 - 1586.24] bugs
[1584.88 - 1588.16] you have your chicken you have your fish
[1586.24 - 1590.48] you have your milk eggs cheese butter
[1588.16 - 1592.08] that doesn't repel anything now just
[1590.48 - 1595.28] just so you know
[1592.08 - 1596.48] it's it's special for time it only
[1595.28 - 1598.88] exists for time
[1596.48 - 1600.16] and then there's an alkaloid in time too
[1598.88 - 1603.52] so
[1600.16 - 1605.20] time carries alkaloids okay
[1603.52 - 1606.88] just like so many other plant foods do
[1605.20 - 1609.44] they have a lot of alkaloids
[1606.88 - 1610.64] and the alkaloid in time is another type
[1609.44 - 1612.96] of antiseptic
[1610.64 - 1615.60] so it repels viruses too so that's
[1612.96 - 1618.24] another thing as well so the alkaloid
[1615.60 - 1619.60] is a chemical compound in time right
[1618.24 - 1625.12] it's in the leaf
[1619.60 - 1625.12] okay the time oil is in the stem
[1625.20 - 1629.12] so that's where the thyme oil is you see
[1627.04 - 1632.16] where the stem is right here you guys
[1629.12 - 1633.92] see that stem see the little leaves
[1632.16 - 1636.00] that's where the alkaloid is that repels
[1633.92 - 1638.00] viruses you see that stem
[1636.00 - 1639.36] that's where the oil is that repels
[1638.00 - 1640.88] viruses okay
[1639.36 - 1643.20] i'm holding a piece of time you guys on
[1640.88 - 1647.20] clubhouse right now
[1643.20 - 1647.76] um so this is where the magic happens
[1647.20 - 1650.24] right there
[1647.76 - 1651.20] it's the antiviral alkaloid which is a
[1650.24 - 1654.80] chemical compound
[1651.20 - 1658.24] phytochemical compound and it's the
[1654.80 - 1660.96] oil that's in the stem right
[1658.24 - 1663.76] that micro oil that's in the stem and so
[1660.96 - 1665.92] these are where the magic lies
[1663.76 - 1667.12] okay and you remember when i told you
[1665.92 - 1669.68] guys
[1667.12 - 1671.68] remember when i told you guys that if
[1669.68 - 1674.88] you eat fat
[1671.68 - 1675.60] it stays in your bloodstream okay clogs
[1674.88 - 1677.92] up the liver
[1675.60 - 1679.12] stays in your bloodstream all right if
[1677.92 - 1681.44] you're eating too much fat
[1679.12 - 1684.72] it gets your bloodstream all clogged up
[1681.44 - 1687.20] but those aren't anti-viral oils
[1684.72 - 1689.28] they're not antiviral that's how it
[1687.20 - 1691.96] works your avocado
[1689.28 - 1694.08] oil in the avocado that fat's not
[1691.96 - 1697.36] anti-viral
[1694.08 - 1699.16] right and so it's it's about
[1697.36 - 1701.52] what foods are the antiviral
[1699.16 - 1702.56] antibacterial compounds you know so the
[1701.52 - 1704.80] oil in time
[1702.56 - 1707.36] and it's not an overt that's the whole
[1704.80 - 1710.56] point no one would ever believe or
[1707.36 - 1713.68] think by just looking at time like this
[1710.56 - 1716.96] that there's fat in it
[1713.68 - 1719.04] and it's on such a minute level
[1716.96 - 1720.72] such of my my new level but that's
[1719.04 - 1722.00] what's incredible and healthy fats are
[1720.72 - 1723.52] great i mean if you're doing healthy
[1722.00 - 1725.36] fats and that's the fats you use that's
[1723.52 - 1726.48] that's great if you do your olive oil
[1725.36 - 1728.00] you do your avocado you do your
[1726.48 - 1729.52] sunflower seeds your hemp seeds your
[1728.00 - 1731.28] nuts and seeds your pumpkin seeds
[1729.52 - 1732.80] you do any of that those are the better
[1731.28 - 1734.96] fats right
[1732.80 - 1736.32] and if you're i would stay off a pork if
[1734.96 - 1738.80] you're an animal protein person
[1736.32 - 1740.72] that fat will make you sick that brings
[1738.80 - 1742.88] down your immune system the more fat you
[1740.72 - 1746.00] eat your immune system can drop
[1742.88 - 1748.56] keep that in mind all right and
[1746.00 - 1750.80] when you get sick or you're coming down
[1748.56 - 1753.36] with something and you eat a heavy meal
[1750.80 - 1754.72] and what constitutes a heavy meal
[1753.36 - 1756.56] this is about immune system boosting
[1754.72 - 1758.80] this is critical information guys just
[1756.56 - 1760.40] take these notes down now if you're
[1758.80 - 1763.20] getting sick
[1760.40 - 1765.20] or you think you were exposed and you
[1763.20 - 1767.36] think that sore throat's coming on
[1765.20 - 1768.40] your body's starting to ache you're not
[1767.36 - 1769.36] feeling good
[1768.40 - 1771.44] you think you might have caught the
[1769.36 - 1772.64] plague think you might have caught the
[1771.44 - 1775.76] flu
[1772.64 - 1779.44] right the last thing you want to do
[1775.76 - 1782.64] is eat a big heavy meal do not eat a big
[1779.44 - 1784.72] heavy meal if you did fine fine just
[1782.64 - 1787.28] don't eat another big heavy meal
[1784.72 - 1789.04] okay but the last thing you want to do
[1787.28 - 1791.52] is eat a big heavy meal
[1789.04 - 1793.36] that will take your immune system down
[1791.52 - 1794.00] all that fat and that big heavy meal
[1793.36 - 1797.44] will take your
[1794.00 - 1798.72] immune system down and then whatever
[1797.44 - 1801.52] you've been exposed to
[1798.72 - 1803.84] the plague some virus you're exposed to
[1801.52 - 1806.64] the flu
[1803.84 - 1807.20] it's gonna get a chance to take off and
[1806.64 - 1810.00] really
[1807.20 - 1812.32] root that's what it's going to do take
[1810.00 - 1814.88] off and really root
[1812.32 - 1816.88] you see how it works trisha marie it's
[1814.88 - 1820.08] valuable information right
[1816.88 - 1821.44] okay and so one of the greatest tools i
[1820.08 - 1822.72] can give you outside of the tools
[1821.44 - 1824.08] themselves that i'm about to do the zinc
[1822.72 - 1825.04] shock therapy the vitamin c shock
[1824.08 - 1827.36] therapy right
[1825.04 - 1828.96] we'll go into that next one of the
[1827.36 - 1830.64] greatest tools i can give you
[1828.96 - 1832.88] is making sure you don't eat that heavy
[1830.64 - 1836.00] meal filled with fat
[1832.88 - 1837.20] right when you got exposed right so if
[1836.00 - 1838.88] you're around somebody
[1837.20 - 1840.40] and you're around somebody and you're
[1838.88 - 1841.76] like oh my god they just came down with
[1840.40 - 1843.04] the plague oh my god i was around
[1841.76 - 1844.56] somebody they just came down with the
[1843.04 - 1845.92] flu oh my god they came down some kind
[1844.56 - 1847.36] of sinus infection
[1845.92 - 1848.80] someone just came down with something oh
[1847.36 - 1850.32] my god someone just was dealing with
[1848.80 - 1852.32] some kind of medical stuff
[1850.32 - 1854.96] and and i'm getting exposed whatever it
[1852.32 - 1856.56] is you don't want to go and tank
[1854.96 - 1857.92] that's when you don't want to go in tank
[1856.56 - 1859.28] and all of a sudden it's like let me go
[1857.92 - 1860.88] tank let me go eat
[1859.28 - 1862.32] all this food let me just you don't want
[1860.88 - 1863.52] to eat that heavy stuff you don't want
[1862.32 - 1865.60] to have that burger you don't want to
[1863.52 - 1867.44] have those eggs you don't want to have
[1865.60 - 1868.96] you don't want to have those um that
[1867.44 - 1870.40] chicken you don't want to have that fish
[1868.96 - 1871.20] you don't want to have those avocados
[1870.40 - 1873.04] you don't want to
[1871.20 - 1874.88] you can do some steamed potatoes in a
[1873.04 - 1876.64] salad you can do some fruit you just
[1874.88 - 1879.76] don't want to
[1876.64 - 1881.28] actually tank that food down
[1879.76 - 1883.04] you don't want to fat yourself to death
[1881.28 - 1885.28] at that moment you don't want to choose
[1883.04 - 1887.84] that moment to fat yourself to death
[1885.28 - 1888.96] because that is how it happens someone
[1887.84 - 1890.48] gets exposed
[1888.96 - 1892.24] they're coming down with something and
[1890.48 - 1893.68] they don't feel good so you know that's
[1892.24 - 1895.60] what happens i got a phone call
[1893.68 - 1896.96] coming through but it's like they're
[1895.60 - 1897.60] coming down something they don't feel
[1896.96 - 1898.96] good
[1897.60 - 1900.96] and that's what happens that's what goes
[1898.96 - 1903.28] wrong and
[1900.96 - 1905.52] what happens with people is that the
[1903.28 - 1906.96] minute they don't feel good
[1905.52 - 1908.32] they're getting the scratchy throat

[2002.48 - 2006.88] my strep throat coming back
[2004.48 - 2008.56] could be my strep throat coming back i
[2006.88 - 2011.84] already had
[2008.56 - 2014.64] a pork chop yeah
[2011.84 - 2016.96] i someone told me pork was good if you
[2014.64 - 2019.36] start getting sick
[2016.96 - 2021.04] i'm gonna have some vegan pizza too why
[2019.36 - 2021.84] would i have vegan pizza if i had a pork
[2021.04 - 2025.92] chop

[2058.64 - 2063.28] pizza
[2059.20 - 2063.28] okay is a good idea all right
[2063.36 - 2068.48] and that's what you don't want to do you
[2065.52 - 2068.48] don't want to do that
[2069.04 - 2073.04] you and and that happens to almost
[2071.68 - 2075.92] everybody
[2073.04 - 2078.08] it happens to oh jack said oh my god
[2075.92 - 2082.24] great i feel sick now
[2078.08 - 2084.16] it happens to almost everybody you guys
[2082.24 - 2085.76] yeah so keep that in mind let's do the
[2084.16 - 2087.84] shock therapies let's go we got the t
[2085.76 - 2090.24] going we talked about time a little bit
[2087.84 - 2092.24] um let's go into the zinc shock therapy
[2090.24 - 2093.68] right there there's his ink
[2092.24 - 2096.16] okay you could do the zinc shock therapy
[2093.68 - 2097.52] in different ways um
[2096.16 - 2101.12] and i'm gonna what i'm gonna do is
[2097.52 - 2103.28] remove these i'm gonna strain these
[2101.12 - 2105.20] i'm gonna do in here remove the twigs
[2103.28 - 2106.64] kind of strain this tee back this tea is
[2105.20 - 2109.68] ready
[2106.64 - 2109.68] let's put this over here
[2110.40 - 2113.36] let's drain this in here let's see if we
[2111.92 - 2114.88] can spill it everywhere wouldn't that be
[2113.36 - 2117.84] great
[2114.88 - 2117.84] let's do that
[2118.16 - 2122.80] okay i'm gonna add some honey to this
[2120.40 - 2124.24] you guys mind
[2122.80 - 2128.24] all right here we go let's add some
[2124.24 - 2128.24] honey add a little bit of honey in there
[2128.56 - 2133.84] there we go add a little bit of lemon
[2131.60 - 2133.84] right
[2135.36 - 2146.32] let's mix that up
[2144.40 - 2149.28] just made the zinc shock therapies honey
[2146.32 - 2149.28] on tick tock amazing
[2150.24 - 2154.40] that's the time t right there
[2156.96 - 2161.92] it's so good i mean yeah it's strong
[2159.84 - 2164.24] it's strong but you can taste
[2161.92 - 2167.52] the medicine you know you can taste that
[2164.24 - 2169.04] medicinal nature to it
[2167.52 - 2171.68] and that's a smart thing to do right
[2169.04 - 2175.76] there with exposure
[2171.68 - 2178.64] exposure of any kind exposure pathogenic
[2175.76 - 2179.68] of any kind just letting you know and
[2178.64 - 2181.28] the tools always there let's see these
[2179.68 - 2183.20] things talk therapy we got that
[2181.28 - 2184.84] now the zinc shock therapy you can do it
[2183.20 - 2187.76] in
[2184.84 - 2189.44] um
[2187.76 - 2190.88] and the zen shock therapy is something i
[2189.44 - 2193.92] would do for me
[2190.88 - 2195.44] my friends okay my family my loved ones
[2193.92 - 2197.52] that's what i use you guys do what your
[2195.44 - 2199.28] doctor tells you your doctor tells you
[2197.52 - 2201.12] you know to do something you do your the
[2199.28 - 2201.52] doctor likes right whatever you want to
[2201.12 - 2204.40] do
[2201.52 - 2205.92] um you can ask your doctor about this
[2204.40 - 2206.56] can ask your doctor about it no problem
[2205.92 - 2208.40] too
[2206.56 - 2210.64] okay i'm just showing you what i do for
[2208.40 - 2214.72] myself i do for my family right
[2210.64 - 2216.00] now um now what i do is
[2214.72 - 2218.48] you can do it a couple different ways
[2216.00 - 2220.40] you can put put it right in your mouth
[2218.48 - 2221.52] um that's one way then shock therapy
[2220.40 - 2222.88] because i talk about that it's in the
[2221.52 - 2225.52] book it's in the medical media new
[2222.88 - 2225.52] edition right here
[2226.16 - 2233.68] i like in the water too all right
[2229.44 - 2236.00] i like it in water as well um
[2233.68 - 2237.44] so and you can put in some water and
[2236.00 - 2238.80] still let it sit in your mouth that's
[2237.44 - 2240.48] something you can do you can also
[2238.80 - 2242.72] swallow it down if you really want to do
[2240.48 - 2245.20] it that way as well you can go
[2242.72 - 2248.40] either way okay so one way to do it is
[2245.20 - 2248.40] you do the two dropper holes
[2250.40 - 2258.64] right put that in your throat
[2254.80 - 2258.64] and two dropper folds this ink
[2259.52 - 2265.36] okay every three hours just like that
[2263.12 - 2266.80] that's in shock therapy okay you can
[2265.36 - 2269.20] hold it in your mouth
[2266.80 - 2270.48] 30 seconds up to a minute whatever you
[2269.20 - 2271.68] feel comfortable with
[2270.48 - 2274.00] right and that's what i tell friends and
[2271.68 - 2275.52] family you know you ask your doctor
[2274.00 - 2277.52] you do what your doctor wants to but
[2275.52 - 2280.72] that's what i tell friends and family
[2277.52 - 2282.64] um and you can do that
[2280.72 - 2284.08] every three hours so it's two dropper
[2282.64 - 2286.00] fulls every three
[2284.08 - 2287.60] hours and you can do it for one day you
[2286.00 - 2291.20] can do it to two days
[2287.60 - 2291.20] so two days is another thing you can do
[2291.60 - 2296.00] renata says his in-shock therapy is
[2293.36 - 2299.28] incredible saved me and my husband from
[2296.00 - 2302.88] cove exposure multiple times
[2299.28 - 2302.88] incredible incredible
[2304.00 - 2308.32] so when it comes down to building our
[2306.88 - 2309.76] immune system there's a couple ways you
[2308.32 - 2312.80] guys can look at it
[2309.76 - 2316.00] right right
[2312.80 - 2317.92] you can build it short term you can
[2316.00 - 2319.76] build it long term
[2317.92 - 2321.12] right so i like building the immune
[2319.76 - 2323.76] system short term
[2321.12 - 2325.20] and long term i like them both so i'll
[2323.76 - 2326.08] talk about that a little bit if you're
[2325.20 - 2330.32] sensitive
[2326.08 - 2331.68] you're welcome to try um a milder
[2330.32 - 2333.92] version of the medical medium shock
[2331.68 - 2335.12] therapy so you can do a milder version
[2333.92 - 2336.40] that's just the version now for my
[2335.12 - 2338.88] friends and family cold white spring
[2336.40 - 2342.24] good see right now
[2338.88 - 2343.76] awesome glad you're here today um elune
[2342.24 - 2346.16] hell good to see you
[2343.76 - 2347.76] glad you're here today so let's work on
[2346.16 - 2349.52] let's talk about zing for a little bit
[2347.76 - 2352.48] zinc is something that we don't
[2349.52 - 2354.72] have in our food anymore so as i was
[2352.48 - 2356.16] talking about before is like oysters
[2354.72 - 2357.60] like someone's like you can get zing
[2356.16 - 2358.56] from oysters make sure you eat a lot of
[2357.60 - 2361.52] oysters
[2358.56 - 2363.44] it's like are you kidding me you know i
[2361.52 - 2364.64] mean you suck down all those oysters i
[2363.44 - 2367.36] mean you're just gonna get
[2364.64 - 2369.12] hepatitis possibly okay because
[2367.36 - 2370.32] literally there's so much mercury in
[2369.12 - 2372.56] that oyster
[2370.32 - 2373.84] so much mercury in that oyster that
[2372.56 - 2376.00] you're just going to feed every bug in
[2373.84 - 2378.08] your body rapidly especially inside the
[2376.00 - 2378.96] liver so oysters are like a bad idea for
[2378.08 - 2381.20] the liver
[2378.96 - 2382.64] because healthy lizards and oysters
[2381.20 - 2383.60] you've got the smiley faces on that one
[2382.64 - 2386.32] yeah because
[2383.60 - 2386.72] there's so much mercury in oysters for
[2386.32 - 2388.72] one
[2386.72 - 2390.64] in dioxins and oysters it's just immune
[2388.72 - 2394.32] system lower
[2390.64 - 2396.00] so it breaks down the immune system and
[2394.32 - 2398.00] people have to understand that that's
[2396.00 - 2401.20] that's a problem all on its own right
[2398.00 - 2403.04] and but mercury feeds
[2401.20 - 2405.52] viruses to begin with so i'm gonna eat a
[2403.04 - 2408.16] bunch of oysters is what i'm gonna do
[2405.52 - 2410.00] eat a bunch of oysters meanwhile you're
[2408.16 - 2411.28] feeding every virus in your body and
[2410.00 - 2411.84] that's that's what goes wrong right
[2411.28 - 2414.80] there
[2411.84 - 2415.28] um and so you got the viruses everybody
[2414.80 - 2418.16] is about
[2415.28 - 2419.60] to say you just got exposure of any kind
[2418.16 - 2421.04] say you're in a new relationship and you
[2419.60 - 2423.28] just picked up one or two varieties of
[2421.04 - 2425.04] epstein-barr by accident
[2423.28 - 2426.80] because everybody's carrying around bugs
[2425.04 - 2427.52] right and you can't carry a new epstein
[2426.80 - 2429.20] bar
[2427.52 - 2430.40] and it's floating in your system the
[2429.20 - 2432.08] last thing you want to do is get a whole
[2430.40 - 2433.52] bunch of oysters in your system too you
[2432.08 - 2435.12] don't want to eat a whole bunch of those
[2433.52 - 2435.84] because basically the mercury is going
[2435.12 - 2438.08] to feed
[2435.84 - 2439.44] the virus and it's going to take off so
[2438.08 - 2439.84] that's something right there to consider
[2439.44 - 2441.52] but
[2439.84 - 2442.96] so it's important to get rid of these
[2441.52 - 2444.00] ideas that are out there another thing
[2442.96 - 2446.24] is pumpkin seeds
[2444.00 - 2447.36] just eat a bunch of pumpkin seeds every
[2446.24 - 2451.04] day
[2447.36 - 2452.16] there's such a minute level of zinc and
[2451.04 - 2454.00] pumpkin seeds
[2452.16 - 2455.36] but the reason why pumpkin seeds are
[2454.00 - 2458.48] heralded
[2455.36 - 2461.04] as being the zinc holy grail
[2458.48 - 2462.72] like pumpkin seeds is the zinc holy
[2461.04 - 2464.48] grail right
[2462.72 - 2466.72] the reason why is because there's
[2464.48 - 2470.00] detectable zinc
[2466.72 - 2473.60] in pumpkin seed detectable
[2470.00 - 2475.60] zinc right detectable doesn't mean
[2473.60 - 2477.68] it's enough zinc to get us by for five
[2475.60 - 2480.00] seconds it doesn't mean it's enough zinc
[2477.68 - 2481.84] to actually restore our zinc reserves it
[2480.00 - 2484.16] doesn't mean it's enough zinc
[2481.84 - 2485.20] to do anything for us pumpkin seeds are
[2484.16 - 2487.84] great for you
[2485.20 - 2489.28] it's the best the one of the best fats
[2487.84 - 2492.40] if you're into fats
[2489.28 - 2493.84] one of the healthiest fats right and
[2492.40 - 2495.44] even with that said you just don't want
[2493.84 - 2496.96] to be downing all this pumpkin seed
[2495.44 - 2498.64] butter and eating all these pumpkin
[2496.96 - 2499.44] seeds because too much fat still too
[2498.64 - 2501.28] much fat because
[2499.44 - 2502.48] that's what's happening out there yeah
[2501.28 - 2504.72] oysters are the
[2502.48 - 2507.28] ocean cleaners so yeah they're really
[2504.72 - 2510.64] toxic for us because of that right there
[2507.28 - 2512.00] so zing toxicity so sue says zing
[2510.64 - 2515.84] toxicity question
[2512.00 - 2517.04] mark um i mean you have to be doing a
[2515.84 - 2519.60] lot of zinc
[2517.04 - 2521.12] a lot of zinc for a zinc toxicity issue
[2519.60 - 2524.00] so keep that in mind
[2521.12 - 2526.40] and so that's important to know but what
[2524.00 - 2529.20] you can get
[2526.40 - 2530.96] with with supplementation is is copper
[2529.20 - 2532.16] toxicity so you got to look out for that
[2530.96 - 2533.36] because people like we got to take
[2532.16 - 2534.88] copper
[2533.36 - 2536.64] because you you know we need copper
[2534.88 - 2537.36] you've got to take copper well copper is
[2536.64 - 2539.84] the immune
[2537.36 - 2541.44] immune system lower as well it lowers
[2539.84 - 2544.64] the immune system
[2541.44 - 2546.64] really takes it down a notch copper is
[2544.64 - 2547.12] so abundant that we're loaded with
[2546.64 - 2549.12] copper
[2547.12 - 2551.12] all of us are saturated with copper
[2549.12 - 2552.72] comes from our new clothes we buy from
[2551.12 - 2554.16] the fungicides all the pesticides and
[2552.72 - 2556.40] herbicides comes from that
[2554.16 - 2558.32] it's dropped out of the sky it's in our
[2556.40 - 2559.92] water comes out of our pipes it comes
[2558.32 - 2562.56] out of you know everywhere comes out of
[2559.92 - 2565.36] wells comes out of town city water right
[2562.56 - 2567.36] so copper we're and then the earth is
[2565.36 - 2570.88] saturated in copper
[2567.36 - 2574.08] so organic organic farm
[2570.88 - 2576.96] land is high in copper
[2574.08 - 2578.40] so all the food we grow is high in
[2576.96 - 2580.40] copper but not
[2578.40 - 2581.52] supposed to be high in copper but it's
[2580.40 - 2584.24] high in copper right
[2581.52 - 2586.32] so we're coppered out that's why we have
[2584.24 - 2587.84] the raging eczema psoriasis
[2586.32 - 2589.84] we have all the issues with skin
[2587.84 - 2590.40] problems copper is a big reason for all
[2589.84 - 2594.00] of that
[2590.40 - 2597.44] so okay so that's important to know um
[2594.00 - 2598.80] so and and we'll just go we'll go a
[2597.44 - 2599.92] little bit deeper into this for one
[2598.80 - 2601.60] second here so
[2599.92 - 2603.28] we're all worried about copper when
[2601.60 - 2604.00] copper that's more abundant than
[2603.28 - 2607.36] anything
[2604.00 - 2610.32] but zinc isn't abundant so like i said
[2607.36 - 2612.96] the zinc is detectable in a pumpkin seed
[2610.32 - 2615.12] but still not enough to keep us going
[2612.96 - 2617.04] you can sit there gobbling down pumpkin
[2615.12 - 2618.48] seeds all day long till you're sick to
[2617.04 - 2619.76] your guts
[2618.48 - 2621.20] and you're not gonna get the zinc you
[2619.76 - 2622.48] need to protect your immune system to
[2621.20 - 2623.52] protect yourself so that's something
[2622.48 - 2625.04] really important though because that
[2623.52 - 2626.80] comes up all the time so i could just
[2625.04 - 2628.56] eat some pumpkin seeds i don't need to
[2626.80 - 2630.00] i don't need to worry about zinc ever i
[2628.56 - 2630.40] don't need to take a few drops of zinc i
[2630.00 - 2632.96] mean
[2630.40 - 2634.32] even if you take like you know i told
[2632.96 - 2635.04] the doctor the other day you could just
[2634.32 - 2637.60] do
[2635.04 - 2638.88] three tiny drops one two three four five
[2637.60 - 2642.32] drops
[2638.88 - 2643.84] you can take one two drops and
[2642.32 - 2645.04] you know you can take a dropper full a
[2643.84 - 2646.32] day depending on what's happening and
[2645.04 - 2647.44] talk about protocols in the medical
[2646.32 - 2650.40] medium books but
[2647.44 - 2652.32] zinc keeps your immune system from
[2650.40 - 2653.84] overreacting and under reacting so
[2652.32 - 2654.88] here's what happens let me give you guys
[2653.84 - 2658.72] this
[2654.88 - 2660.24] okay so um
[2658.72 - 2662.00] you got a virus right here and this is
[2660.24 - 2664.08] medical medium information about sin
[2662.00 - 2665.76] okay that doctors are actually using out
[2664.08 - 2667.60] there and i saw something out there
[2665.76 - 2669.68] plagiarized information wasn't cited
[2667.60 - 2673.20] back to mm but
[2669.68 - 2674.16] viruses when you get exposed to a flu
[2673.20 - 2677.44] virus
[2674.16 - 2680.40] or exposed to some kind of plague virus
[2677.44 - 2681.44] right which is essentially really a flu
[2680.40 - 2683.84] virus
[2681.44 - 2685.84] when you get exposed to that that
[2683.84 - 2687.44] hybridized flu virus
[2685.84 - 2690.96] that's what the plague is hybridized
[2687.44 - 2694.96] blue virus when you get exposed to that
[2690.96 - 2697.92] your immune system can overreact
[2694.96 - 2700.16] your immune system can also under react
[2697.92 - 2702.84] and that's what takes a per that's why
[2700.16 - 2704.08] that person there got real sick real
[2702.84 - 2707.36] fast
[2704.08 - 2710.40] that person there got sick kind of
[2707.36 - 2714.80] slow and steady but
[2710.40 - 2718.24] stayed sick too long that person
[2714.80 - 2721.92] got sick too fast but
[2718.24 - 2723.68] got better quicker doesn't mean that's a
[2721.92 - 2726.96] good thing it either because they got
[2723.68 - 2730.40] so sick so fast it shocked the system
[2726.96 - 2730.96] that person got sick so slow but stayed
[2730.40 - 2733.84] sick
[2730.96 - 2734.88] longer would shock the system you see so
[2733.84 - 2738.72] that right there
[2734.88 - 2741.52] it's one thing or a bug is so bad a flu
[2738.72 - 2744.32] virus is so bad
[2741.52 - 2746.56] that your system gets shocked so bad
[2744.32 - 2749.04] you're in trouble okay
[2746.56 - 2751.44] so that's overreacting so what happens
[2749.04 - 2755.28] is our immune system without zinc
[2751.44 - 2757.52] overreacts under reacts overreacts
[2755.28 - 2759.44] under reacts see how it works you guys
[2757.52 - 2762.72] it's really important info
[2759.44 - 2765.36] overreacts and under reacts zinc
[2762.72 - 2765.76] in our body keeps your immune system
[2765.36 - 2769.12] from
[2765.76 - 2771.92] freaking out but keeps it also
[2769.12 - 2773.76] from not going to sleep because your
[2771.92 - 2776.56] immune system also can stay asleep
[2773.76 - 2777.92] it's just staying asleep you're sick but
[2776.56 - 2780.64] it's a sleep
[2777.92 - 2781.28] it's a sleep and that can happen too
[2780.64 - 2783.20] right
[2781.28 - 2784.80] but you don't want one or the other you
[2783.20 - 2787.44] especially don't want
[2784.80 - 2788.56] your immune system overreacting that's
[2787.44 - 2791.44] what you don't want
[2788.56 - 2793.44] right darlene it's really interesting um
[2791.44 - 2796.56] and so that's what i love about zinc
[2793.44 - 2799.36] so it's that modular it's that modulator
[2796.56 - 2800.00] it's what it is it's like modulating you
[2799.36 - 2802.08] know
[2800.00 - 2804.16] it's like that power box that's
[2802.08 - 2807.04] modulating for a surge
[2804.16 - 2808.16] a power surge and that's what it does so
[2807.04 - 2810.00] that's what zinc does so that's
[2808.16 - 2812.96] important um
[2810.00 - 2814.80] and that's what i love about it so
[2812.96 - 2816.00] anyway let's talk about vitamin c we did
[2814.80 - 2817.84] some zinc shock therapy
[2816.00 - 2819.44] we talked about that look you guys want
[2817.84 - 2820.88] more info on that
[2819.44 - 2824.16] zinc shark therapy in the medical medium
[2820.88 - 2828.08] new edition boom it's right there
[2824.16 - 2831.36] okay let's talk about vitamin c
[2828.08 - 2834.32] therapy too we'll go into there now so
[2831.36 - 2836.80] microc is the one that i use which is um
[2834.32 - 2840.32] the vimergy microc
[2836.80 - 2842.16] and what's what's tricky about vitamin c
[2840.32 - 2845.28] is if you have a sensitive tummy
[2842.16 - 2848.40] right get a sensitive tummy
[2845.28 - 2849.36] a vitamin c is like battery acid to your
[2848.40 - 2851.28] tummy
[2849.36 - 2852.64] that's what it could feel like battery
[2851.28 - 2856.84] acid to your tummy
[2852.64 - 2859.92] so ascorbic acid straight ascorbic
[2856.84 - 2861.28] acid and some people they're too
[2859.92 - 2862.88] sensitive for that
[2861.28 - 2865.68] they're sensitive they're either
[2862.88 - 2868.48] inflamed they have no hcl
[2865.68 - 2869.36] they're just sensitive so their lining
[2868.48 - 2870.72] is sensitive
[2869.36 - 2872.48] in their small intestinal tract they're
[2870.72 - 2873.44] duodenum they're stomach lining
[2872.48 - 2875.28] sensitive
[2873.44 - 2877.36] so so when it comes to vitamin c this is
[2875.28 - 2880.08] the only one that i feel confident now
[2877.36 - 2881.12] that because we need vitamin c we need
[2880.08 - 2882.64] vitamin c
[2881.12 - 2884.56] so the only one that i feel really
[2882.64 - 2888.08] confident about okay
[2884.56 - 2890.00] and it's it's it's one that's buffered
[2888.08 - 2891.60] enough and that's the whole key so
[2890.00 - 2893.28] that's the one i recommend it's the
[2891.60 - 2895.76] vimorgy you guys know
[2893.28 - 2901.68] um so anyway there's the micro seat
[2895.76 - 2904.88] right there
[2901.68 - 2906.72] so maria says i almost didn't get fevers
[2904.88 - 2909.36] before medical medium information
[2906.72 - 2911.20] after starting i have had really high
[2909.36 - 2914.32] temperatures
[2911.20 - 2918.48] over 40.5 cell celsius
[2914.32 - 2919.84] so i mean the thing is with that is it's
[2918.48 - 2921.92] really important to know is like i want
[2919.84 - 2924.56] you to be your own detective
[2921.92 - 2925.76] and so were you starting medical medium
[2924.56 - 2927.68] information
[2925.76 - 2929.36] because you were feeling like you were
[2927.68 - 2931.44] getting sick
[2929.36 - 2932.80] or heading to a place of getting sick
[2931.44 - 2934.32] happens to a lot of people
[2932.80 - 2936.40] there's something inside of them that
[2934.32 - 2938.08] just says i'm gonna go
[2936.40 - 2940.32] start doing some medical medium
[2938.08 - 2942.56] information because i need to
[2940.32 - 2944.32] start getting better because i'm
[2942.56 - 2945.44] something in me i'm not feeling better
[2944.32 - 2946.80] i'm not feeling good
[2945.44 - 2948.72] it's one thing's really important to
[2946.80 - 2951.28] know um
[2948.72 - 2953.60] the other thing is is were you exposed
[2951.28 - 2954.40] to a new infection so ask your doctors
[2953.60 - 2956.08] these things
[2954.40 - 2958.00] you know you should talk to your doctors
[2956.08 - 2959.44] about this like ask your doctor
[2958.00 - 2961.36] you know because i've talked to doctors
[2959.44 - 2962.88] about this stuff and it's like
[2961.36 - 2965.28] some people get exposed to new
[2962.88 - 2965.84] infections is it a new relationship did
[2965.28 - 2968.80] they get
[2965.84 - 2970.88] mono and now they have mono and strep
[2968.80 - 2972.64] throat because they have a new infection
[2970.88 - 2974.40] from a new relationship
[2972.64 - 2975.76] did they get do they pick something up
[2974.40 - 2977.84] from a public bathroom
[2975.76 - 2979.52] in a restaurant they were eating food in
[2977.84 - 2982.32] one of the things that i tell people
[2979.52 - 2983.04] to really look out for is chefs cutting
[2982.32 - 2985.60] their fingers
[2983.04 - 2986.08] it happens every day in the restaurants
[2985.60 - 2989.12] more
[2986.08 - 2990.64] people eat chef's blood than anybody
[2989.12 - 2993.12] could ever even know
[2990.64 - 2994.72] it happens every single night a sous
[2993.12 - 2997.84] chef
[2994.72 - 2999.20] someone helping a kitchen hand cuts
[2997.84 - 3001.28] their fingers in the kitchen
[2999.20 - 3003.20] right a lot of people have thin skin on
[3001.28 - 3004.80] their hands they're getting cut and
[3003.20 - 3008.56] scratched while they're working
[3004.80 - 3010.24] moving boxes then they're handling food
[3008.56 - 3011.76] chefs are cutting their fingers they put
[3010.24 - 3013.12] a band-aid on and put a rubber glove but
[3011.76 - 3015.04] there's blood everywhere
[3013.12 - 3017.20] so this is another thing too so one of
[3015.04 - 3018.00] the biggest ways we actually transfer
[3017.20 - 3021.36] viruses
[3018.00 - 3023.20] pathogens around is through eating out
[3021.36 - 3024.80] that's the that's like between
[3023.20 - 3026.48] relationships
[3024.80 - 3027.84] that's the second big one so it's
[3026.48 - 3030.64] relationships the first bit
[3027.84 - 3031.36] first one right there and then boom
[3030.64 - 3034.40] eating out
[3031.36 - 3037.60] that's the second one right there and so
[3034.40 - 3040.72] um i mean that's important to know
[3037.60 - 3043.76] and and when it comes down to
[3040.72 - 3046.08] when it comes down to okay like
[3043.76 - 3047.36] what i would do me personally if i was
[3046.08 - 3050.00] getting fevers
[3047.36 - 3051.84] i would be like okay good thing i'm
[3050.00 - 3054.00] doing medical medium information
[3051.84 - 3055.36] because if i wasn't how bad would all
[3054.00 - 3057.04] that stuff be
[3055.36 - 3058.72] because it's the whole point it's about
[3057.04 - 3060.40] making sure you're so proactive and
[3058.72 - 3062.08] taking care of yourself so at least
[3060.40 - 3063.36] you've got that in your hands
[3062.08 - 3065.20] i'm sure you get the support from your
[3063.36 - 3067.60] doctors to do medical medium information
[3065.20 - 3068.72] ask your doctors you know if you can do
[3067.60 - 3071.76] mm info
[3068.72 - 3072.88] um and and learn about it but there's a
[3071.76 - 3073.52] couple things about being your own
[3072.88 - 3076.40] detective
[3073.52 - 3077.28] and what's happening in your foods is mm
[3076.40 - 3079.12] info
[3077.28 - 3080.72] minus the chocolate the caffeine the
[3079.12 - 3082.24] apple cider vinegar nutritional yeast
[3080.72 - 3082.80] the whey protein powder the protein
[3082.24 - 3085.12] powders
[3082.80 - 3086.16] the fish oil is it minus all that that's
[3085.12 - 3088.16] just some things right there it's
[3086.16 - 3090.88] medical medium information
[3088.16 - 3092.56] minus all the fats is medical medium
[3090.88 - 3094.40] information minus the eggs the chilled
[3092.56 - 3096.40] milk cheese dairy butter
[3094.40 - 3097.92] so it's one thing it's one thing we can
[3096.40 - 3100.56] say
[3097.92 - 3101.92] hey medical media information i'm doing
[3100.56 - 3102.88] but are you doing medical medium
[3101.92 - 3104.56] information
[3102.88 - 3106.08] how much medical mean information are
[3104.56 - 3107.20] you doing so these are things to
[3106.08 - 3110.16] consider right there
[3107.20 - 3112.00] like are you doing just celery juice or
[3110.16 - 3114.64] a heavy metal detox smoothie
[3112.00 - 3115.60] are you still eating eggs dairy
[3114.64 - 3118.80] chocolate
[3115.60 - 3120.56] matcha tea kombucha tea bone broth
[3118.80 - 3122.08] apple cider vinegar vinegars what else
[3120.56 - 3124.56] are you doing and then
[3122.08 - 3125.12] are you still doing collagen the protein
[3124.56 - 3128.00] powders
[3125.12 - 3128.96] citric acid natural flavors alcohol all
[3128.00 - 3130.96] these things matter
[3128.96 - 3132.32] right there because if you're doing any
[3130.96 - 3134.32] of that stuff
[3132.32 - 3136.08] you means you're only dabbling in
[3134.32 - 3137.68] medical medium information
[3136.08 - 3140.00] so when you're dabbling it should be
[3137.68 - 3141.84] like you know what i started dabbling in
[3140.00 - 3143.68] medical medium information
[3141.84 - 3145.28] i started playing around celery just a
[3143.68 - 3147.68] little um
[3145.28 - 3149.84] and and that's what i'm doing and oh my
[3147.68 - 3152.00] god these fevers are so bad
[3149.84 - 3153.20] because i started dabbling in medical
[3152.00 - 3155.28] medium information
[3153.20 - 3157.12] so just all i just want people to be
[3155.28 - 3160.16] their own detective
[3157.12 - 3161.36] so they know how to heal themselves they
[3160.16 - 3162.96] know what to tell their doctors
[3161.36 - 3165.52] to learn how to heal let's keep on going
[3162.96 - 3166.72] you guys this is a great live this is
[3165.52 - 3168.32] fun because i love talking about the
[3166.72 - 3169.12] immune system what we can do i love
[3168.32 - 3172.08] talking about
[3169.12 - 3174.00] tools how to heal doing the medical
[3172.08 - 3176.08] medium vitamin c
[3174.00 - 3177.60] shock therapy is what we're going to do
[3176.08 - 3178.32] so we're going to do one cup of water to
[3177.60 - 3180.56] start with
[3178.32 - 3183.60] all right so let's do that let's get
[3180.56 - 3183.60] some water going on here
[3185.04 - 3192.80] we're going to open up um
[3188.88 - 3196.24] two 500 milligram capsules right here
[3192.80 - 3198.88] vitamin c microc
[3196.24 - 3198.88] get that going
[3202.16 - 3206.32] um look you guys when it comes down to
[3204.72 - 3206.72] essential oils i'm going to be straight
[3206.32 - 3208.64] up
[3206.72 - 3210.16] i don't recommend taking them internally
[3208.64 - 3210.96] i know they get the essential oil crowd
[3210.16 - 3212.32] really upset
[3210.96 - 3214.96] you guys on clubhouse just letting you
[3212.32 - 3215.44] know um you guys on tic-tac letting you
[3214.96 - 3218.32] know
[3215.44 - 3219.36] facebook youtube i don't like the
[3218.32 - 3221.44] ingestion
[3219.36 - 3222.56] of essential oils i think it was a bad
[3221.44 - 3225.20] idea
[3222.56 - 3226.24] i think it was a bad idea from the start
[3225.20 - 3230.16] just letting you know
[3226.24 - 3231.36] okay essential oils right i i do like i
[3230.16 - 3233.44] do support
[3231.36 - 3235.84] i support them when it comes down to on
[3233.44 - 3238.40] the skin i support them on that level
[3235.84 - 3239.60] infusions right infusers i support them
[3238.40 - 3242.32] in that level too
[3239.60 - 3244.16] you know vaporizers using them in those
[3242.32 - 3244.72] like i support essential oils i'm fine
[3244.16 - 3248.08] with it
[3244.72 - 3251.52] but consuming them internally
[3248.08 - 3253.92] i saw a lot of disasters happen right
[3251.52 - 3255.84] so ingesting the ingesting them it was
[3253.92 - 3256.24] never a medical medium recommendation it
[3255.84 - 3257.68] was
[3256.24 - 3259.36] to any of the people that came to me
[3257.68 - 3262.32] personally for 35 years
[3259.36 - 3264.40] for 30 years was never something i would
[3262.32 - 3267.12] ever do in fact every time
[3264.40 - 3268.32] someone would get into my office right
[3267.12 - 3270.08] they'd get into my office
[3268.32 - 3272.64] okay i got my appointment with you this
[3270.08 - 3275.20] would be like 1995 or
[3272.64 - 3276.08] 1999 or whatever years all the years i
[3275.20 - 3279.12] did this i'd have
[3276.08 - 3281.76] people coming into my office and
[3279.12 - 3283.20] i would be like you're not ingesting
[3281.76 - 3284.72] those essential oils right because i
[3283.20 - 3286.32] would hear it all the time like yeah
[3284.72 - 3287.76] i'm told to drink the essential oils
[3286.32 - 3289.36] that's going to help my lyme disease i
[3287.76 - 3292.88] feel like oh my god dear lord
[3289.36 - 3294.72] no it's not and sensitive people
[3292.88 - 3296.24] they their nervous system can't handle
[3294.72 - 3298.80] it it can really
[3296.24 - 3299.44] really wig them out without their vagus
[3298.80 - 3300.96] nerve
[3299.44 - 3302.40] totally wigged out their bags their
[3300.96 - 3302.72] stress their vagus nerve out stress
[3302.40 - 3305.76] their
[3302.72 - 3308.08] their their um phrenic nerves out
[3305.76 - 3309.28] and and this is inhaling it too
[3308.08 - 3311.60] essential oils
[3309.28 - 3312.96] inhaling certain essential oils can be
[3311.60 - 3314.64] too strong for people with nervous
[3312.96 - 3316.48] system sensitivities
[3314.64 - 3318.48] with tightness of chest tightness of
[3316.48 - 3320.16] throat you know vagus phrenic nerve
[3318.48 - 3323.44] issues anxiety depression
[3320.16 - 3324.56] so i would always err in caution on
[3323.44 - 3326.32] essential oils
[3324.56 - 3327.68] say if you've got real sensitivities
[3326.32 - 3330.40] where in the sense where you're
[3327.68 - 3331.20] neurologically sensitive don't even
[3330.40 - 3334.16] breathe them in
[3331.20 - 3334.48] real don't breathe in strong amounts of
[3334.16 - 3336.56] it
[3334.48 - 3337.92] light and airy is fine little here and
[3336.56 - 3338.56] there on your wrist and you're just not
[3337.92 - 3340.08] covering
[3338.56 - 3341.60] don't wipe your whole body down with
[3340.08 - 3343.28] essential oil if you've got
[3341.60 - 3345.52] nervous system issues that are really
[3343.28 - 3348.80] sensitive i've always said this and
[3345.52 - 3351.20] and and do not ingest them don't be
[3348.80 - 3352.24] drinking essential oil concoctions i'm
[3351.20 - 3354.00] just letting you know
[3352.24 - 3355.84] that was never a recommendation here
[3354.00 - 3357.44] andrea says i got sicker after ingesting
[3355.84 - 3361.04] essential oils for a year
[3357.44 - 3363.68] haven't since starting medical media yet
[3361.04 - 3365.04] it's way too much on people way too much
[3363.68 - 3366.00] on people so that's something that's
[3365.04 - 3367.92] important that's worth
[3366.00 - 3369.76] right now that alone that piece of
[3367.92 - 3370.80] information is worth the price of
[3369.76 - 3373.76] admission here
