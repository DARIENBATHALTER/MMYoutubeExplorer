[143.20 - 148.76] brand new episode today today it's
[146.76 - 151.04] launched and it's
[148.76 - 152.84] about
[151.04 - 155.48] [Music]
[152.84 - 157.40] okay that's what it's about you listen
[155.48 - 159.80] to it twice already crispy

[159.80 - 163.72] but today listen today today okay those
[161.76 - 166.52] are some of the announcements but today
[163.72 - 168.12] we're talking about shingles shingles
[166.52 - 169.80] shingles this is going to be good we're
[168.12 - 171.20] going to cover some detailed information
[169.80 - 174.28] it's critical for people who are
[171.20 - 177.44] chronically my mysteriously suffering
[174.28 - 180.24] from chronic illness if that made any
[177.44 - 182.48] sense people are struggling out there
[180.24 - 184.84] suffering with symptoms and may not
[182.48 - 187.92] realize or don't realize or highly doubt
[184.84 - 191.24] they realize that the shingles can be
[187.92 - 194.36] behind why they are suffering why they
[191.24 - 196.56] are struggling the shingles and I'm
[194.36 - 198.64] talking about the shingles on a rooftop
[196.56 - 201.32] talking about the shingles on somebody's
[198.64 - 203.48] body or in their body without having a
[201.32 - 204.76] rash and that's interesting because
[203.48 - 206.56] we're going to cover that topic too
[204.76 - 209.44] because medical research and science
[206.56 - 212.52] without a study is just starting to talk
[209.44 - 215.20] about shingles viruses with no rashes
[212.52 - 217.44] present internal shingles that's
[215.20 - 220.28] interesting because who right here
[217.44 - 222.12] published almost a decade ago I was the
[220.28 - 223.72] first to talk about that that shingles
[222.12 - 224.96] variey is without rash is because of
[223.72 - 227.60] spirit of
[224.96 - 229.72] compassion exactly how would I ever know
[227.60 - 231.92] that how would I ever find that out it
[229.72 - 234.08] never existed anywhere published here
[231.92 - 236.64] first medical research and science
[234.08 - 238.92] almost a decade later are starting to
[236.64 - 240.52] talk about it they don't have a study
[238.92 - 242.48] where did they get the information I
[240.52 - 244.08] wonder because millions of copies of the
[242.48 - 246.16] medical medium book One have gone around
[244.08 - 247.88] the globe and countless doctors are
[246.16 - 249.96] using them and so forth all around the
[247.88 - 252.32] globe right scientists and everything I
[249.96 - 254.28] wonder where they got that non rashing
[252.32 - 256.80] shingles thing that they don't have a
[254.28 - 259.08] study for incredible so this is good so
[256.80 - 260.68] let's cover some of this information I'm
[259.08 - 264.72] excited to see you guys glad to be here
[260.68 - 267.92] what's in front of me right now pray

[398.88 - 404.52] shingles virus let's go into it a little
[401.60 - 408.32] bit this is really interesting okay the
[404.52 - 409.32] chicken poox myth whoa that they're
[408.32 - 412.00] going to they're going to talk about
[409.32 - 414.44] this later too so not only did they take
[412.00 - 417.20] medical medium info on the non- rashing
[414.44 - 419.04] shingles but I guarantee you mark my
[417.20 - 420.88] words right now I don't care if it's a
[419.04 - 422.88] 100 years from now I don't care if it's
[420.88 - 424.60] 50 years 20 years from now I'm telling
[422.88 - 427.04] you right now they're going to take this
[424.60 - 430.20] right here this is next because they're
[427.04 - 434.28] busted they're busted check this out
[430.20 - 436.20] ready the chickenpox myth contrary to
[434.28 - 439.88] the current beliefs of medical research
[436.20 - 443.64] and science one way that you can't get
[439.88 - 443.64] shingles is through
[444.00 - 449.84] chickenpox your doctor May tell you that
[446.64 - 452.16] if you've had chickenpox sooner or later
[449.84 - 453.92] you'll get shingles you guys know this
[452.16 - 455.72] do you guys know this like do you know
[453.92 - 456.88] this information Med conventional
[455.72 - 458.36] medical research and science or
[456.88 - 459.80] alternative it's all the same now
[458.36 - 461.72] they're both together they're in bed
[459.80 - 464.36] together by the way sorry to say it but
[461.72 - 466.68] they're they're in bed together okay
[464.36 - 468.76] anyway contrary to the current beliefs
[466.68 - 471.00] of medical research and science one way
[468.76 - 473.36] that you can't get shingles is through
[471.00 - 476.08] chickenpox did you hear what I just said
[473.36 - 479.56] your doctor May tell you that if you've
[476.08 - 480.60] had chickenpox sooner or later you'll
[479.56 - 483.28] get
[480.60 - 484.56] shingles they'll say sooner or later
[483.28 - 487.08] you'll get shingles if you had
[484.56 - 488.96] chickenpox you'll get shingles okay now
[487.08 - 491.76] they're going to take this too I know
[488.96 - 492.80] it's coming I know because a birdie in
[491.76 - 496.64] my
[492.80 - 497.88] ear named s so birdie and my ear is
[496.64 - 500.88] telling me they're going to go with this
[497.88 - 503.96] one next and it's coming it's kind of
[500.88 - 506.68] exciting by the way biggest mistake they
[503.96 - 508.08] made they say shingles is contagious
[506.68 - 510.32] we're going to go into that part yet
[508.08 - 512.96] with I can't wait this is not the case
[510.32 - 514.96] the only thing chickenpox has in common
[512.96 - 516.96] with shingles is that they're both
[514.96 - 520.44] viruses in the herpes family that can
[516.96 - 522.48] cause a rash what that means you guys
[520.44 - 525.08] chickenpox isn't the shingles they're
[522.48 - 526.92] not the same thing they've been feeding
[525.08 - 528.72] that one that's a huge mistake by the
[526.92 - 531.04] industry they've been feeding that huge
[528.72 - 534.84] mistake to people for decades and
[531.04 - 537.04] decades what a lame mistake me km says I
[534.84 - 539.96] never had chickenpox and I have shingles
[537.04 - 542.72] indeed you're right and and yeah that's
[539.96 - 545.24] how it works because they're two
[542.72 - 547.40] different bugs a major mistake in the
[545.24 - 548.64] medical world two different bugs and
[547.40 - 550.12] just like they made a mistake because
[548.64 - 551.48] they didn't know about the non rashing
[550.12 - 554.36] shingles until they took it from the
[551.48 - 556.16] medical medium book just that mistake
[554.36 - 558.44] alone here's the second mistake they're
[556.16 - 560.72] going to have
[558.44 - 562.56] to they're going to have to chalk up
[560.72 - 564.32] they're going to have to cough up and
[562.56 - 567.48] that second mistake is
[564.32 - 569.88] coming chickenpox is an entirely
[567.48 - 574.08] different species of herpes
[569.88 - 576.28] virus from shingles entirely
[574.08 - 580.52] different
[576.28 - 584.20] chickenpox shingles or shingles
[580.52 - 586.24] chickenpox shingles
[584.20 - 589.04] chickenpox
[586.24 - 593.64] exactly they essentially have nothing to
[589.04 - 596.32] do with each other nothing to do with
[593.64 - 597.96] each other yeah so they're going to take
[596.32 - 599.28] that too coming up pretty soon
[597.96 - 602.72] eventually you're going to see something
[599.28 - 605.08] come up and it's going to be like we've
[602.72 - 606.84] just discovered that chickenpox is not
[605.08 - 609.84] the shingles they're two different
[606.84 - 612.80] viruses but there there what it is is
[609.84 - 615.20] they're going to be busted I have
[612.80 - 618.16] delivered that information for decades
[615.20 - 621.56] published it in here many years ago and
[618.16 - 624.08] talked about it for years okay why are
[621.56 - 628.16] we being told shingles is chickenpox
[624.08 - 630.04] related when it's not why are we being
[628.16 - 632.36] told that
[630.04 - 635.24] this is a prime example of
[632.36 - 637.68] misinformation that was accepted at one
[635.24 - 640.68] point because it sounded like it made
[637.68 - 642.96] sense it was a theory that sounded like
[640.68 - 645.12] it made sense just like the autoimmune
[642.96 - 646.80] theory that sounded like it made sense
[645.12 - 648.56] where your body is attacking itself but
[646.80 - 651.64] your body isn't attacking itself because
[648.56 - 654.44] that's a theory that they never proved
[651.64 - 657.28] they never witnessed an auto antibody
[654.44 - 659.76] under a microscope attacking a gland or
[657.28 - 662.92] a cell or an organ you guys
[659.76 - 665.64] they never witnessed the immune system
[662.92 - 667.76] attacking a gland or an organ it was
[665.64 - 669.20] never witnessed it still isn't today
[667.76 - 670.68] millions of people are walking into
[669.20 - 673.00] their doctor's offices getting
[670.68 - 675.12] autoimmune diagnosis and with not a
[673.00 - 677.56] shred of proof that their body is turned
[675.12 - 680.12] on them or their body has even gone
[677.56 - 683.40] after a gland or an organ or tissue it
[680.12 - 685.96] is made up made up BS by the
[683.40 - 687.84] industry and everybody's just sucker it
[685.96 - 689.44] into it and that's the world we live in
[687.84 - 691.60] and if you know how the world works and
[689.44 - 694.16] how corrupt the world is overall with
[691.60 - 696.36] different different things realize it's
[694.16 - 698.84] corrupt in everything and that's part of
[696.36 - 700.24] it right there all in its own you guys
[698.84 - 702.84] somebody just asked what book it is it's
[700.24 - 705.24] a medical medium New Edition medical
[702.84 - 707.24] medium book one New Edition it's an
[705.24 - 708.84] incredible book talks about epscene bar
[707.24 - 711.20] talks about the shingles talks about the
[708.84 - 713.12] conditions and symptoms it creates Ms
[711.20 - 715.16] fibromyalgia thyroid problems
[713.12 - 717.84] hypothyroid all of it is in here this
[715.16 - 721.16] thing's packed it's jam-packed with
[717.84 - 724.12] protocols and in information that's
[721.16 - 725.96] mindblowing okay this is prime example
[724.12 - 727.48] of misinformation that was accepted at
[725.96 - 730.76] one point because it sounded like it
[727.48 - 733.56] made sense then was perpetuated to the
[730.76 - 735.64] point where it's now ingrained we have
[733.56 - 737.72] it ingrained in everybody's
[735.64 - 740.76] Consciousness it's like very deep in
[737.72 - 743.20] their skull in their brain that shingles
[740.76 - 744.80] means chickenpox they're the same thing
[743.20 - 746.52] once you had chickenpox you're going to
[744.80 - 748.44] have shingles which is nonsense that's
[746.52 - 750.16] not how it works not to mention that
[748.44 - 752.64] medical research and science don't have
[750.16 - 755.24] a lot of accountability when it comes to
[752.64 - 756.60] viruses no they don't we know that
[755.24 - 760.12] already just from
[756.60 - 763.20] 2020 they lack information and know very
[760.12 - 765.16] little in this area the plague of sea
[763.20 - 769.08] has shown this to be true we know what
[765.16 - 771.00] I'm talking about the plague of sea okay
[769.08 - 772.68] still till this day I'm not going to
[771.00 - 776.24] mention that
[772.68 - 779.24] word it's the best I can all right let's
[776.24 - 783.04] go into it a little bit shingle
[779.24 - 785.12] transmission and triggers as with as
[783.04 - 787.20] with any virus in the herpes family
[785.12 - 791.20] there are numerous ways to catch
[787.20 - 794.12] shingles to catch it to transfer it you
[791.20 - 796.24] can get it passed down from your
[794.12 - 798.84] parents you can get it through a
[796.24 - 801.52] transfusion of infected
[798.84 - 803.48] blood you can get it through an exchange
[801.52 - 805.60] of bodily fluids you can get the
[803.48 - 808.24] shingles through and exchange of bodily
[805.60 - 809.36] fluids very easily from a public
[808.24 - 812.12] bathroom
[809.36 - 815.64] from a handle on a carriage in the
[812.12 - 818.04] grocery store you can get shingles
[815.64 - 821.32] easily just see you now and even from
[818.04 - 822.88] the blood from a chef's finger from the
[821.32 - 825.40] knife chopping up your food in the
[822.88 - 827.64] restaurants the biggest mistake they
[825.40 - 829.72] made they say
[827.64 - 832.56] shingles is
[829.72 - 835.24] contagious if it's contagious then you
[832.56 - 836.48] can straight up catch Jingles you don't
[835.24 - 839.28] need
[836.48 - 842.20] chickenpox huh
[839.28 - 843.48] what wait a minute what did I just say
[842.20 - 845.08] that's the most screwed up thing I've
[843.48 - 848.40] ever heard come out of my
[845.08 - 852.36] mouth I mean jeez looks like I'm getting
[848.40 - 854.68] something going on there on tick so
[852.36 - 857.76] yeah
[854.68 - 860.12] so I can just tell you right now when
[857.76 - 862.96] you think about this think about this
[860.12 - 866.96] think about how crazy this is right
[862.96 - 869.84] so if shingles is
[866.96 - 871.76] contagious right
[869.84 - 874.44] and then you can catch shingles from
[871.76 - 877.28] someone else who has
[874.44 - 880.68] shingles where's the chickenpox
[877.28 - 881.72] part where does that go what happened
[880.68 - 884.24] there with
[881.72 - 887.52] chickenpox someone please tell
[884.24 - 889.92] me I'm confused I'm scratching my head
[887.52 - 892.80] on that
[889.92 - 896.24] one think about this one is this not M
[892.80 - 899.16] blowing right they say that you can only
[896.24 - 901.52] get shingles from chickenpox so you have
[899.16 - 904.00] to have chickenpox first and then it
[901.52 - 905.96] soals goes dormant in the body and then
[904.00 - 908.16] you get shingles later on in your 50s
[905.96 - 909.72] and 60s when you're 50 years old when
[908.16 - 911.96] you're 60 years old that's when you end
[909.72 - 915.16] up getting chickenpox right that's what
[911.96 - 916.64] we're told so this is kind of funny
[915.16 - 919.44] because I'm thinking about this for a
[916.64 - 921.40] minute because how does that work so if
[919.44 - 923.96] someone has shingles and then you go
[921.40 - 926.20] near them and they have shingles you
[923.96 - 927.60] catch the shingles from them but you
[926.20 - 931.16] don't catch
[927.60 - 932.92] chickenpox how in
[931.16 - 938.48] the
[932.92 - 941.92] world does that work Bust It bust it
[938.48 - 943.48] again once again bust it they didn't
[941.92 - 945.60] think that went through when they told
[943.48 - 947.52] everybody shingles is chickenpox all
[945.60 - 949.28] these decades all these doctors were
[947.52 - 950.88] told in medical school that chickenpox
[949.28 - 952.80] is shingles never saw a shred of
[950.88 - 953.92] evidence or proof I know I've talked to
[952.80 - 957.04] doctors that have gone through medical
[953.92 - 959.48] school no one's ever seen a petri dish
[957.04 - 961.88] or or something under the glass the
[959.48 - 963.52] looking glass of a scope that determines
[961.88 - 966.96] what the difference is there or anything
[963.52 - 969.12] about it so here you are you're told
[966.96 - 970.76] that shingles is chickenpox you have to
[969.12 - 972.96] catch chickenpox first or have
[970.76 - 974.80] chickenpox and then it goes dormant and
[972.96 - 977.60] then your shingles comes out like 50
[974.80 - 979.84] years later how's it possible that you
[977.60 - 981.68] can catch then shingles directly from
[979.84 - 984.28] somebody who has shingles you should
[981.68 - 985.88] then really technically catch chickenpox
[984.28 - 988.16] everybody should be getting chickenpox
[985.88 - 989.88] from somebody who has shingles and it
[988.16 - 993.04] must start start off that way before it
[989.88 - 996.16] becomes shingles 50 years from that huge
[993.04 - 998.40] mistake bust it once again let's go into
[996.16 - 1000.32] this a little bit signs you could be
[998.40 - 1002.68] suffering from the onset of a shingles
[1000.32 - 1005.16] infection include flu like fever and
[1002.68 - 1006.88] chills feeling headaches or migraines
[1005.16 - 1010.24] aches and pains burning pain itching
[1006.88 - 1013.00] tingling and rash puls or blisters if
[1010.24 - 1014.88] it's an actual rashing shingle if it's a
[1013.00 - 1016.28] non- rashing shingle you're not going to
[1014.88 - 1017.48] see it on your body you're not going to
[1016.28 - 1020.24] see the
[1017.48 - 1022.80] rash medical communities believe that
[1020.24 - 1025.84] those last two symptoms red rash and PS
[1022.80 - 1028.04] always accompany shingles in fact this
[1025.84 - 1031.56] is merely the classic presentation of
[1028.04 - 1034.48] one type only of the Zer virus so this
[1031.56 - 1036.32] leads us into the next thing here okay
[1034.48 - 1038.12] if medical research and science are now
[1036.32 - 1040.40] saying because they took from medical
[1038.12 - 1042.76] medium book one here they took the
[1040.40 - 1044.92] information that there's more than one
[1042.76 - 1047.08] varieties of shingle there they took the
[1044.92 - 1049.24] information of that there's this non
[1047.08 - 1050.68] rashing variety of shingle that sits
[1049.24 - 1052.72] inside somebody and they call it
[1050.68 - 1055.04] internal shingles
[1052.72 - 1056.72] right they're really saying there's more
[1055.04 - 1058.48] than one variety and that's the whole
[1056.72 - 1060.48] point in this book I talk about how
[1058.48 - 1062.92] there's more than one variety there's
[1060.48 - 1065.44] over 30 varieties and even more and it's
[1062.92 - 1069.40] climbing because of mutations because of
[1065.44 - 1069.40] people Contracting them and spreading
[1071.28 - 1077.56] them so the classic herpes Zer virus is
[1075.08 - 1080.08] you get it across one side like on the
[1077.56 - 1082.76] side here of the rib or somewhere in the
[1080.08 - 1085.32] back right here or you get a strip of it
[1082.76 - 1087.68] along your back or on your side or maybe
[1085.32 - 1089.96] down here lower by your butt right and
[1087.68 - 1091.96] you get the strip have anybody have you
[1089.96 - 1096.40] guys ever had that right the classic
[1091.96 - 1099.88] herpy Zer variety that's one right there
[1096.40 - 1101.96] okay and that's one type if a patient
[1099.88 - 1104.60] displays PS and blisters that look
[1101.96 - 1106.96] different then the barcode style rash
[1104.60 - 1109.40] and the blisters and pbls are in unusual
[1106.96 - 1112.72] areas doctors often won't consider it
[1109.40 - 1116.64] shingles at all but now they do now they
[1112.72 - 1119.40] do 10 years ago when this book was was
[1116.64 - 1119.40] okay put into
[1119.64 - 1124.36] motion medical research and Science and
[1122.24 - 1126.00] medical doctors only believed in the
[1124.36 - 1128.32] classic variety of shingles where it was
[1126.00 - 1130.08] just this one strip on you and it had to
[1128.32 - 1131.76] be
[1130.08 - 1134.12] textbook
[1131.76 - 1136.12] now they're calling shingles in all
[1134.12 - 1138.08] kinds of different shapes and sizes just
[1136.12 - 1140.16] like identified in this book medical
[1138.08 - 1142.56] media medium including internal shingles

[1167.24 - 1170.24] edition
[1171.28 - 1176.20] okay all right let's go into it a little
[1173.56 - 1178.52] bit deeper we talked about transmission
[1176.20 - 1181.28] it's easy to
[1178.52 - 1183.56] catch if the medical
[1181.28 - 1186.48] world in the medical world shingles
[1183.56 - 1188.96] seems like an open and shut case you got
[1186.48 - 1191.80] a patient with the textbook rash skin
[1188.96 - 1194.28] pain on one side That's all
[1191.80 - 1198.32] folks close the case close the door on
[1194.28 - 1200.40] the case but it's changing now so so
[1198.32 - 1202.12] let's go into some other different stuff
[1200.40 - 1203.44] we're talking about classic shingles and
[1202.12 - 1206.32] we're going to cut into some of these
[1203.44 - 1209.52] other ones there are seven strains of
[1206.32 - 1211.24] shingles that cause rashes you guys you
[1209.52 - 1212.56] might be able to identify some of the
[1211.24 - 1214.92] stuff happening in your life through
[1212.56 - 1218.04] this right here while the resulting PS
[1214.92 - 1220.12] are painful if they're in an easy to
[1218.04 - 1221.88] spot location that the doctor Associates
[1220.12 - 1223.12] with the standard variety of shingles
[1221.88 - 1225.40] then they look like the classic
[1223.12 - 1228.52] perversion doctors are accustomed to
[1225.40 - 1231.28] seeing in medical school in a sense that
[1228.52 - 1233.28] they can be a blessing it's that one
[1231.28 - 1235.96] classic variety of herpes
[1233.28 - 1237.68] Zer because the rash makes it more like
[1235.96 - 1239.92] that your doctor will see and realize
[1237.68 - 1241.72] what you have and that's helpful and
[1239.92 - 1243.08] they won't call it idiopathic so they
[1241.72 - 1245.12] won't say you just have this strange
[1243.08 - 1248.64] rash we don't know what it
[1245.12 - 1250.96] is okay however most shingles rashes may
[1248.64 - 1252.80] be unidentifiable to the doctor because
[1250.96 - 1254.52] of their location and pattern let's cut
[1252.80 - 1256.96] into some of these all right we talked
[1254.52 - 1259.36] about the classic shingles let's move on
[1256.96 - 1263.08] upper body sh shingles let's hit that
[1259.36 - 1265.48] one the rash appears from the chest
[1263.08 - 1267.88] up that's that's a shingles variety
[1265.48 - 1270.32] where the rash appears from chest up
[1267.88 - 1272.92] okay on the upper chest shoulders or
[1270.32 - 1274.76] neck but not on the arms this rash is
[1272.92 - 1276.72] the closest in appearance to the most
[1274.76 - 1278.84] common shingles variety so that's an
[1276.72 - 1283.00] entirely different strain so when
[1278.84 - 1286.32] anybody has shingles from chest up neck
[1283.00 - 1288.96] top of shoulders chest up that's a
[1286.32 - 1290.60] different variety of shingles
[1288.96 - 1291.92] these are important to know if you've
[1290.60 - 1293.60] been somebody that's your plagued with
[1291.92 - 1295.44] trigeminal neuralgia and you got aches
[1293.60 - 1297.20] and pains and you got all kinds of
[1295.44 - 1299.80] different fatigue and other issues
[1297.20 - 1301.88] constantly and nerve pain and you're
[1299.80 - 1303.48] you're you're squeezing your teeth down
[1301.88 - 1304.52] and crunching them up and breaking them
[1303.48 - 1306.68] in the middle of the night you got to
[1304.52 - 1309.04] wear a mouth guard all the time like all
[1306.68 - 1310.32] this is good information that's one
[1309.04 - 1312.80] variety here's another variety of
[1310.32 - 1316.24] shingles both arm
[1312.80 - 1319.88] shingles you can get them on both arms
[1316.24 - 1322.60] okay rash appears EX exclusively on both
[1319.88 - 1325.32] arms and on both
[1322.60 - 1327.36] hands also the rash has an altered
[1325.32 - 1330.88] pattern somewhat spotty with large and
[1327.36 - 1333.12] small P sometimes spaced apart on arms
[1330.88 - 1335.60] and hands that's a variety all on its
[1333.12 - 1339.56] own that's not the chickenpox bug that's
[1335.60 - 1343.28] not the chickenpox virus it's not that's
[1339.56 - 1345.00] its own separate okay identity its own
[1343.28 - 1346.28] separate virus by the way there's a
[1345.00 - 1348.16] reason why I have all this food here
[1346.28 - 1349.80] because I'm going to talk about how sh
[1348.16 - 1351.36] Les loves these Foods we're going to go
[1349.80 - 1353.24] into that a little bit here's one right
[1351.36 - 1356.68] here one arm
[1353.24 - 1360.68] shingles the rash appears on one arm
[1356.68 - 1364.56] only it can be either arm but not both
[1360.68 - 1369.20] arms it's one arm only so you get the
[1364.56 - 1372.32] shingles rash on one arm and one arm
[1369.20 - 1374.24] only okay this breakout also has an
[1372.32 - 1376.52] altered pattern somewhat spotty with
[1374.24 - 1378.60] large and small Pall spaced apart let's
[1376.52 - 1382.08] hit another one head shingle
[1378.60 - 1386.00] brutal people
[1382.08 - 1388.76] commit life ending because of it I have
[1386.00 - 1392.56] to not say that word or I'll probably
[1388.76 - 1396.40] lose Tik Tock but people commit the end
[1392.56 - 1399.52] of life if you know what I mean from
[1396.40 - 1401.92] head shingles that's how bad head
[1399.52 - 1403.40] shingles is for so many people where
[1401.92 - 1405.32] they get the shingles on their head or
[1403.40 - 1407.40] they get it somewhere in their mouth or
[1405.32 - 1408.40] they just get it in their sinuses and
[1407.40 - 1412.44] their head
[1408.40 - 1414.76] face the yeah people don't want to live
[1412.44 - 1416.32] when they have that happens all the time
[1414.76 - 1419.24] out there it's really
[1416.32 - 1422.20] sad the rash appears on the top and the
[1419.24 - 1424.00] sides of the head including the face
[1422.20 - 1426.36] also you can have this variety inside
[1424.00 - 1428.16] the mouth on the tongue throat or
[1426.36 - 1429.84] anywhere else in the
[1428.16 - 1433.80] mouth
[1429.84 - 1437.08] shingles can be really bad it can kill
[1433.80 - 1439.16] someone it can it's life-threatening
[1437.08 - 1440.72] there's different variety ities there's
[1439.16 - 1443.08] like I'm reading here your classic
[1440.72 - 1444.56] shingles other varieties of shingles but
[1443.08 - 1446.00] somebody can have more than one variety
[1444.56 - 1448.84] of shingles they can have two or three
[1446.00 - 1450.60] varieties of shingles but can be
[1448.84 - 1454.32] lifethreatening
[1450.60 - 1456.24] that's how bad shingles can hurt and be
[1454.32 - 1459.32] someone may have to be literally on
[1456.24 - 1461.96] morphine prescribed by their doctor
[1459.32 - 1464.20] because are the neurologist or so forth
[1461.96 - 1465.88] because shingles can get so bad could be
[1464.20 - 1467.84] on the face head it could be in the
[1465.88 - 1470.92] mouth it could be on the tongue it could
[1467.84 - 1473.80] be in the throat in the
[1470.92 - 1476.80] throat which is
[1473.80 - 1479.08] brutal it can be right in the tongue it
[1476.80 - 1481.76] could be all in the mouth and it can be
[1479.08 - 1484.08] on the hypoglossal nerves the cranial
[1481.76 - 1486.36] nerves going through here it can be on
[1484.08 - 1489.20] like the Ooa Factory nerve you got the
[1486.36 - 1491.08] hypog glassa nerve you the facial nerve
[1489.20 - 1493.48] you got it can be anywhere in these
[1491.08 - 1496.80] nerves which is just really
[1493.48 - 1499.16] brutal the resulting PS are tinier than
[1496.80 - 1501.64] those of the above strains so it's
[1499.16 - 1504.16] different than your regular herpes Zer
[1501.64 - 1506.40] that's on the side of you
[1504.16 - 1509.24] right and they sometimes have little
[1506.40 - 1513.72] horns on top you can get a variety of
[1509.24 - 1516.00] shingles in the mouth on the face on the
[1513.72 - 1517.96] tongue that have
[1516.00 - 1520.72] horns like
[1517.96 - 1522.40] horns and they're just brutal so many
[1520.72 - 1525.00] people have lived like this still doe
[1522.40 - 1527.00] today they get it out there and they and
[1525.00 - 1529.36] medical communities often misdiagnose
[1527.00 - 1532.12] this type as a fungus that needs to be
[1529.36 - 1534.40] treated with antifungal or steroid
[1532.12 - 1539.32] cream
[1534.40 - 1540.92] mistake major mistake which leads to
[1539.32 - 1543.72] terrifying
[1540.92 - 1546.64] stuff so when someone literally is
[1543.72 - 1548.60] suffering and they have shingles in
[1546.64 - 1551.68] their mouth and their throat and they're
[1548.60 - 1554.04] in Untold Agony that no one can ever
[1551.68 - 1556.52] understand because their nerves are so
[1554.04 - 1559.92] lit up in their cranial area their
[1556.52 - 1563.44] facial nerves are so lit up their their
[1559.92 - 1565.40] hypoglossal nerve is literally so lit up
[1563.44 - 1567.96] they got the shingles eating away at the
[1565.40 - 1571.84] nerves and just ripping into their mouth
[1567.96 - 1573.84] and then the medical communities believe
[1571.84 - 1578.48] it's a fungus that needs to be treat it
[1573.84 - 1580.80] with an antifungal or steroid cream dear
[1578.48 - 1584.24] Lord dear
[1580.80 - 1584.24] Lord dear
[1586.04 - 1592.12] God I can't even
[1588.96 - 1594.08] inset yep aaine over there on YouTube
[1592.12 - 1597.84] says what about shingles in the back and
[1594.08 - 1599.24] sciatic nerves indeed of course we're
[1597.84 - 1601.56] going to talk about
[1599.24 - 1603.44] that okay let's head into the next one
[1601.56 - 1606.24] both leg
[1603.44 - 1607.92] shingles rash appears on both legs one
[1606.24 - 1610.68] leg two
[1607.92 - 1612.76] leg rash appears on both legs but
[1610.68 - 1614.72] nowhere else it has a different
[1612.76 - 1616.60] appearance than standard shingles with
[1614.72 - 1620.08] pbls that look almost like
[1616.60 - 1621.56] constellations up in the sky right
[1620.08 - 1623.24] there's the little dipper there's the
[1621.56 - 1625.20] Big
[1623.24 - 1626.76] Dipper I mean I've talked to people
[1625.20 - 1628.64] throughout the the years throughout the
[1626.76 - 1631.20] decades and doctors where it's like
[1628.64 - 1632.68] there's constellations on them where
[1631.20 - 1636.44] it's like the Little Dippers on their
[1632.68 - 1638.12] leg the big dippers on their leg
[1636.44 - 1640.28] Yeah
[1638.12 - 1642.16] constellations th says over there on
[1640.28 - 1644.68] YouTube my mother also had it on the
[1642.16 - 1647.88] left side of her body and on her back
[1644.68 - 1650.36] and she also had it lingering nerve pain
[1647.88 - 1652.72] for about a year and a half it was quite
[1650.36 - 1656.20] horrible for her can you imagine in your
[1652.72 - 1658.20] mouth in your throat or on the head on
[1656.20 - 1660.16] the ear with your throat and mouth how
[1658.20 - 1663.24] bad that could be people get it all the
[1660.16 - 1665.12] time out there it's devastating tragic
[1663.24 - 1668.48] actually
[1665.12 - 1669.72] tragic so the both leg shinkles shows up
[1668.48 - 1671.32] like all these different pretty
[1669.72 - 1674.36] constellations as if you're looking at
[1671.32 - 1678.88] the stars up there
[1674.36 - 1681.24] right okay go a little bit
[1678.88 - 1684.64] vaginal area
[1681.24 - 1685.68] shingles this is a very bad bad bad
[1684.64 - 1689.16] variety of
[1685.68 - 1691.64] shingles and it's its own strain and
[1689.16 - 1694.16] it's brutal and it's caused a lot of
[1691.64 - 1695.76] problems with women they suffered
[1694.16 - 1699.28] greatly with
[1695.76 - 1701.76] this and I've heard stories out there
[1699.28 - 1704.48] and I've seen things and I've talked to
[1701.76 - 1706.96] doctors and top Specialists throughout
[1704.48 - 1710.36] the years and people have ended their
[1706.96 - 1712.88] lives because of this variety of
[1710.36 - 1714.88] shingles affecting only women this
[1712.88 - 1718.36] strain causes a rash that appears
[1714.88 - 1721.28] outside but near the V vagina between
[1718.36 - 1724.16] the rectum and vagina or on Lower
[1721.28 - 1726.80] buttocks or inside the crotch area The
[1724.16 - 1729.96] Strain is especially notable because
[1726.80 - 1733.36] doctors often misdiagnose it as sexually
[1729.96 - 1734.64] transmitted herpes okay so there's a
[1733.36 - 1738.24] shingles
[1734.64 - 1741.96] variety that gets a misdiagnosis all the
[1738.24 - 1745.64] time of sexually transmitted Herpes
[1741.96 - 1749.72] Simplex 2 think about that right how
[1745.64 - 1752.20] many women have this Jingles virus but
[1749.72 - 1756.04] it's misconstrued and misdiagnosed as
[1752.20 - 1760.04] herpes simplex 2o think about that
[1756.04 - 1762.40] right that's that's devastating for a
[1760.04 - 1764.60] lot of women but there are more women
[1762.40 - 1767.88] getting diagnosed with this variety of
[1764.60 - 1770.44] shingles which is not on the docket the
[1767.88 - 1771.56] medical research and science dock it yet
[1770.44 - 1773.48] remember this is all advanced
[1771.56 - 1775.76] information and research and science
[1773.48 - 1778.36] just took recently they just took the
[1775.76 - 1780.32] non- rashing shingles part out of this
[1778.36 - 1782.12] book but they're they're going to
[1780.32 - 1783.44] they're going to get other pieces and
[1782.12 - 1785.04] they're going to take other pieces out
[1783.44 - 1788.24] of this book as well as we go as they go
[1785.04 - 1791.48] along they don't care they're
[1788.24 - 1793.56] Shameless so this strain is notable
[1791.48 - 1796.48] because doctors often misdiagnose it as
[1793.56 - 1798.64] a sexually transmitted herpes creating
[1796.48 - 1801.08] unnecessary emotional pain for hundreds
[1798.64 - 1803.28] of thousands of women globally it's a
[1801.08 - 1805.64] shingles
[1803.28 - 1808.08] variety that's between the vagina and
[1805.64 - 1810.96] the rectum or other areas in the crotch
[1808.08 - 1813.48] and so forth that is an ongoing
[1810.96 - 1816.00] infection of shingles that just comes in
[1813.48 - 1819.24] goes and gets diagnosed as herpes
[1816.00 - 1821.88] simplex 2 by the
[1819.24 - 1824.08] system the primary way to tell these
[1821.88 - 1826.08] illnesses apart is that the strain of
[1824.08 - 1829.04] the shingles virus we're talking about
[1826.08 - 1833.44] causes substan IAL pain while genital
[1829.04 - 1836.44] herpes herpes simplex virus 2 HSV 2 is
[1833.44 - 1838.96] typically less painful this variety of
[1836.44 - 1841.52] shingles virus is so
[1838.96 - 1843.68] painful but doctors they're just like
[1841.52 - 1847.16] well I know we think it's Simplex 2 but
[1843.68 - 1850.44] it's so painful it's far more painful
[1847.16 - 1853.00] than Simplex 2 this shingles virus I'm
[1850.44 - 1857.76] talking about vaginal area shingles
[1853.00 - 1859.96] virus is far more painful than Simplex 2
[1857.76 - 1861.72] also this shingles virus creates puls
[1859.96 - 1866.08] that are relatively spread out in the
[1861.72 - 1869.84] genital area and lower buttocks while
[1866.08 - 1871.28] hsv2 pules tend to Cluster within a
[1869.84 - 1875.60] small
[1871.28 - 1877.56] area so hsv2 Herpes Simplex 2 clusters
[1875.60 - 1883.28] in a small
[1877.56 - 1885.68] area and right and there you go and the
[1883.28 - 1888.44] uh this variety of vaginal shingles
[1885.68 - 1890.00] tends to spread out more
[1888.44 - 1891.64] okay and that's a brutal variety of
[1890.00 - 1893.96] shingles let's go into shingles
[1891.64 - 1896.44] neurotoxin talk a little bit for a
[1893.96 - 1898.68] couple of minutes shingles neurotoxin
[1896.44 - 1900.32] talk all right one of the misconceptions
[1898.68 - 1903.36] about shingles is that the virus is
[1900.32 - 1905.84] lurking directly within the skin
[1903.36 - 1908.28] rash that's never the case the virus
[1905.84 - 1910.48] lies much deeper underneath the skin and
[1908.28 - 1912.40] even inside the bloodstream and liver at
[1910.48 - 1914.64] the very same time positioning itself
[1912.40 - 1917.96] for the most effective inflammatory
[1914.64 - 1920.04] possibility on your nervous system so
[1917.96 - 1923.56] what this means
[1920.04 - 1926.08] is that medical research resarch and
[1923.56 - 1928.72] science thinks it's really at the right
[1926.08 - 1931.56] by the P it's the P right they think
[1928.72 - 1933.36] it's there but really it's positioned
[1931.56 - 1935.84] deeper and even in the liver in other
[1933.36 - 1939.00] place it's still contagious but it's
[1935.84 - 1941.60] deeper in organs and in the
[1939.00 - 1944.60] bloodstream however the virus releases a
[1941.60 - 1947.36] unique mix of neurotoxin so the virus
[1944.60 - 1950.68] releases a neurotoxin it eats food it
[1947.36 - 1950.68] likes right it eats cheese
[1952.12 - 1958.88] like nice right it eats cheese it loves
[1955.64 - 1960.56] butter this is what it eats the shingles
[1958.88 - 1962.32] viruses all eat
[1960.56 - 1965.00] butter
[1962.32 - 1966.24] butter they do so when someone's dealing
[1965.00 - 1967.56] with chronic shingles and chronic
[1966.24 - 1968.56] shingles and they're suffering in all
[1967.56 - 1970.52] kinds of different ways don't even
[1968.56 - 1974.20] realize it they don't even need a rash
[1970.52 - 1974.20] the non- rashing variety and they're
[1974.24 - 1978.08] suffering they're eating butter and
[1976.40 - 1979.36] their viruses are staying alive cuz the
[1978.08 - 1982.52] viruses are eating the butter they're
[1979.36 - 1984.08] having a field day they love gluten
[1982.52 - 1986.96] nobody knew
[1984.08 - 1988.64] that hey W gluten has been around a long
[1986.96 - 1992.40] time you're not the man that discovered
[1988.64 - 1994.72] gluten no I'm not but s so is the one
[1992.40 - 1996.76] that discovered that viruses such as
[1994.72 - 1998.72] shingles and epine bar feed off of
[1996.76 - 2001.08] gluten and nobody knew that nobody knew
[1998.72 - 2002.48] that gluten fed anything in the medical
[2001.08 - 2005.64] industry or the Alternative Health
[2002.48 - 2008.84] industry nobody knew that gluten fed
[2005.64 - 2010.76] things like bugs that's mm info I'm only
[2008.84 - 2012.80] reminding people you'll see it out there
[2010.76 - 2014.72] now cuz it's constantly poached and
[2012.80 - 2017.40] never cited
[2014.72 - 2020.20] okay another food right here right
[2017.40 - 2023.80] cheese gluten right there okay this is
[2020.20 - 2027.04] interesting so the sushi so the
[2023.80 - 2029.80] sushi why should that do anything or why
[2027.04 - 2032.08] should that be a problem such a healthy
[2029.80 - 2033.80] food it's like real food so many
[2032.08 - 2035.80] different influencers eat it all the
[2033.80 - 2037.28] time I mean if you just look around and
[2035.80 - 2039.08] you see influencers out there there
[2037.28 - 2041.44] they're all like sushi out that's what
[2039.08 - 2043.40] they do right it's every night but what
[2041.44 - 2046.60] happens is viruses like epine bar and
[2043.40 - 2049.56] shingles feed off the mercury in the
[2046.60 - 2052.12] tuna they feed off the mercury in the
[2049.56 - 2055.04] tuna that creates a really good
[2052.12 - 2057.48] neurotoxin for viruses eventually
[2055.04 - 2059.12] Landing somebody with a sickness at some
[2057.48 - 2060.96] point because the viruses will get
[2059.12 - 2063.24] stronger and stronger and stronger as
[2060.96 - 2065.88] they're feeding off of more and more
[2063.24 - 2068.92] Sushi which is the
[2065.88 - 2070.72] tuna the
[2068.92 - 2074.32] Mercury
[2070.72 - 2077.68] okay the virus releases a unique mix of
[2074.32 - 2079.20] neurotoxin and dermatoxin combined
[2077.68 - 2080.80] here's the difference between an Epstein
[2079.20 - 2083.04] bar I'll just use this for an Epstein
[2080.80 - 2086.00] bar right now okay the difference with
[2083.04 - 2088.44] an epine bar is it releases a neurotoxin
[2086.00 - 2091.48] when it eats its favorite foods okay
[2088.44 - 2094.52] like cheese it'll release a
[2091.48 - 2097.64] neurotoxin but not necessarily A
[2094.52 - 2100.04] dermatoxin so much it can can release a
[2097.64 - 2103.16] dermatoxin but not all varieties of
[2100.04 - 2105.28] epine bar release a dermatoxin just some
[2103.16 - 2107.20] okay the difference
[2105.28 - 2110.12] with
[2107.20 - 2113.04] shingles is it will release a unique
[2110.12 - 2115.52] blend of neuro and Derma that's the
[2113.04 - 2118.32] difference right there with the
[2115.52 - 2120.52] shingles and in these seven strains I'm
[2118.32 - 2123.44] talking about the viral poison travels
[2120.52 - 2126.24] outward to the periphal nerves and
[2123.44 - 2128.12] lights you on fire and then you're on
[2126.24 - 2130.44] fire suffering from
[2128.12 - 2132.32] shingles all right let's hit shingles
[2130.44 - 2135.84] without rashes for a little bit too okay
[2132.32 - 2137.84] it's got so much to cover and a lot of
[2135.84 - 2139.84] information good to see you guys coming
[2137.84 - 2142.32] on here
[2139.84 - 2143.40] great lots of fun stuff to talk about
[2142.32 - 2144.60] and I'm also going to share the book
[2143.40 - 2147.08] because everybody keeps on asking this
[2144.60 - 2149.56] is medical medium book one New Edition
[2147.08 - 2152.84] when you read this book you'll be mind
[2149.56 - 2154.28] blown this this book speaks to the soul
[2152.84 - 2156.52] of the person who's
[2154.28 - 2158.24] suffering it speaks to the person who's
[2156.52 - 2161.36] been the the underdog it speaks to the
[2158.24 - 2163.96] person who has been misunderstood it
[2161.36 - 2167.24] speaks to the person who has been living
[2163.96 - 2169.68] with symptoms that maybe aren't visible
[2167.24 - 2171.84] and they're suffering inside they're
[2169.68 - 2173.92] tormented inside but their symptoms
[2171.84 - 2175.88] aren't really exhibiting on the outside
[2173.92 - 2179.20] so that people see and they're like you
[2175.88 - 2181.00] look good you look great how are you

[2185.08 - 2190.68] got brain fog I got like OCD and all
[2188.84 - 2193.24] kinds of different problems now and I'm
[2190.68 - 2195.36] not doing good and that's what this

[2208.48 - 2211.96] Incredible Book make sure you check it
[2210.48 - 2213.80] out we're into shingles right now a
[2211.96 - 2215.52] little bit and you guys just before we
[2213.80 - 2218.00] move on to the non- rashing shingles
[2215.52 - 2220.64] which I'm excited to talk talk about I
[2218.00 - 2222.96] just want to say if you just got on here
[2220.64 - 2225.84] okay check out medical medum podcast at
[2222.96 - 2229.72] Apple podcast I put out a new episode
[2225.84 - 2231.36] it's about drinking it's about drinking
[2229.72 - 2232.28] I got to be careful my word choices here
[2231.36 - 2236.16] it's about
[2232.28 - 2239.20] drinking don't miss it and check out my
[2236.16 - 2241.68] telegram please because the four platter
[2239.20 - 2245.00] shows are back they were removed months
[2241.68 - 2248.28] ago not by me I mentioned this earlier
[2245.00 - 2250.16] and now they are back and you'll hear
[2248.28 - 2254.00] why and how when you listen to the
[2250.16 - 2256.16] telegram on on what happened okay let's
[2254.00 - 2259.04] go into shingles without
[2256.16 - 2263.00] rashes the eight non rashing strains
[2259.04 - 2265.32] produce a neurotoxin and they hurt they
[2263.00 - 2267.76] hurt so what people need to understand
[2265.32 - 2270.16] is these non rashers really hurt bad
[2267.76 - 2273.00] let's hit one right here neuralgic
[2270.16 - 2275.60] shingles also known as diabetic
[2273.00 - 2279.04] neuropathy does anybody have diabetic
[2275.60 - 2282.00] neuropathy or does anybody have
[2279.04 - 2284.12] neuropathy because I said this for years
[2282.00 - 2287.44] that there were more people with
[2284.12 - 2289.72] neuropathy than there were with diabetic
[2287.44 - 2291.92] neuropathy just for the record right
[2289.72 - 2293.88] there another thing that I think the
[2291.92 - 2296.72] industry is now taken from this book I
[2293.88 - 2299.68] think I saw it like a year ago out there
[2296.72 - 2302.24] and there's diabetic neuropathy but
[2299.68 - 2303.76] that's only some people with diabetic
[2302.24 - 2306.28] neuropathy they're diabetics with
[2303.76 - 2308.48] neuropathy all diabetic neuropathy is
[2306.28 - 2310.48] you guys is a
[2308.48 - 2312.68] diabetic with
[2310.48 - 2315.04] neuropathy and then there's all these
[2312.68 - 2315.92] other people that aren't diabetics and
[2315.04 - 2319.76] they got
[2315.92 - 2323.44] neuropathy there's more people with
[2319.76 - 2325.76] neuropathy than there is with people di
[2323.44 - 2327.48] that diabetics with neuropathy okay all
[2325.76 - 2331.44] right just want to make sure that's
[2327.48 - 2333.52] clear all right neuralgic shingles which
[2331.44 - 2335.96] primary attacks the lower extremities
[2333.52 - 2338.16] creating nerve pain like numbness
[2335.96 - 2341.08] burning in in the legs burning in the
[2338.16 - 2344.00] feet it's often called diabetic
[2341.08 - 2346.72] neuropathy and misidentified as a
[2344.00 - 2351.08] complication of diabetes this is a huge
[2346.72 - 2352.88] medical myth that needs to be debunked
[2351.08 - 2354.88] unless there's an obvious injury or
[2352.88 - 2357.36] imped to the nerves the sensations a
[2354.88 - 2360.48] patient is feeling is not
[2357.36 - 2363.68] neuropathy it's something else it's the
[2360.48 - 2366.08] shingles it's inflamed nerves because of
[2363.68 - 2367.60] non rashing shingles I wanted to cover
[2366.08 - 2368.68] that a little a bit if you know anybody
[2367.60 - 2371.60] dealing with
[2368.68 - 2374.92] neuropathy okay take this book to your
[2371.60 - 2374.92] doctor and say is it the
[2375.12 - 2381.56] shingles let's see p fiction says I get
[2379.12 - 2384.72] neuropathy but I'm not
[2381.56 - 2386.44] diabetic I I believe that because people
[2384.72 - 2388.40] that's what happens there's so many more
[2386.44 - 2391.96] people that are not diabetic that have
[2388.40 - 2395.52] neuropathy there's so many more it's way
[2391.96 - 2397.88] more than anybody can imagine actually
[2395.52 - 2401.48] all right so I talking about about that
[2397.88 - 2403.60] um okay this variety of shingles occurs
[2401.48 - 2405.08] more often in patients without diabetes
[2403.60 - 2408.12] than in patients with
[2405.08 - 2410.64] diabetes so Sophie norstrom says what is
[2408.12 - 2412.52] neuropathy it's a mysterious condition
[2410.64 - 2414.44] medical research and science doesn't
[2412.52 - 2417.88] quite understand entirely they just know
[2414.44 - 2421.80] it as pain they just know it as nerve
[2417.88 - 2424.28] pain they believe happening in the
[2421.80 - 2427.36] legs primarily in the legs that's what
[2424.28 - 2429.08] they've said all these years okay
[2427.36 - 2432.60] let's go a little bit deeper in let's go
[2429.08 - 2434.56] into this this variety of of um shingles
[2432.60 - 2437.16] this is a non rashing we're a non
[2434.56 - 2441.08] rashing varieties you guys here's one
[2437.16 - 2444.88] maddening itch shingles so maddening
[2441.08 - 2447.96] itch shingles okay like crazy just just
[2444.88 - 2450.00] itchy you can't reach the itch you can't
[2447.96 - 2452.32] reach it you can scratch all you want
[2450.00 - 2454.56] but you can't you can't get in there you
[2452.32 - 2456.72] can't reach it all
[2454.56 - 2459.52] right this virus creat creates a
[2456.72 - 2461.56] continually moving itch that can't be
[2459.52 - 2463.64] scratched that's because the virus is
[2461.56 - 2466.48] irritating nerves too far beneath the
[2463.64 - 2467.32] skin to be reached with fingers that's
[2466.48 - 2470.24] your
[2467.32 - 2472.84] nerves it's like I'm itchy all the time
[2470.24 - 2475.00] but I can't really touch it it you
[2472.84 - 2476.92] almost touch it it almost feels good but
[2475.00 - 2479.92] it's not enough you're not finding the
[2476.92 - 2482.12] spots because the itch is deeper that's
[2479.92 - 2484.96] what variety that is if the virus is
[2482.12 - 2489.36] empowered by a weak immune system and or
[2484.96 - 2493.40] by triggers stick of butter some gluten
[2489.36 - 2496.12] some Mercury from some sushi some eggs
[2493.40 - 2498.72] how about some eggs as well
[2496.12 - 2501.20] right
[2498.72 - 2504.12] and and other things that can easily
[2501.20 - 2506.92] feed your shingles virus perfumes colog
[2504.12 - 2509.32] air fresheners scented candles all the
[2506.92 - 2511.92] fragrances all the stuff the detergents
[2509.32 - 2513.48] the fabric softeners the uh whatever
[2511.92 - 2515.36] just it keeps on going going going the
[2513.48 - 2517.40] air fresheners in the cars right boob
[2515.36 - 2519.16] boo boob
[2517.40 - 2522.24] yeah it could all feed it and get that
[2519.16 - 2526.56] one worse okay let's go to a a vaginal
[2522.24 - 2529.16] shingles non rashing vaginal shingles
[2526.56 - 2532.60] okay this virus affects only women it
[2529.16 - 2536.08] goes deep into the inner vaginal walls
[2532.60 - 2537.96] and inflames the nerves there okay it
[2536.08 - 2540.64] also travels inside the bladder and
[2537.96 - 2543.72] rectum to wreak additional Havoc
[2540.64 - 2547.64] creating a burning so irritating it's
[2543.72 - 2550.20] akin to torture that's vaginal shingles
[2547.64 - 2553.00] a non- rashing
[2550.20 - 2556.24] mysterious vaginal
[2553.00 - 2558.36] shingles if a doctor doesn't dismiss it
[2556.24 - 2561.92] as being all in your
[2558.36 - 2564.00] head I can't tell you how many times I
[2561.92 - 2566.92] heard that throughout the decades
[2564.00 - 2569.92] doctors dismissing this variety of
[2566.92 - 2571.40] vaginal shingles as being all in the
[2569.92 - 2574.60] woman's
[2571.40 - 2576.80] head because she or he can't find the
[2574.60 - 2579.28] cause she or he will typically
[2576.80 - 2581.04] misdiagnose it once again as a hormonal
[2579.28 - 2583.00] imbalance and prescribe hormones to
[2581.04 - 2584.96] treat it this is not an effective
[2583.00 - 2587.20] treatment and can sometimes make the
[2584.96 - 2589.80] situation work worse many women have
[2587.20 - 2592.32] truly suffered from this variety of
[2589.80 - 2595.28] vaginal
[2592.32 - 2599.88] shingles okay and the medical industry
[2595.28 - 2604.60] ignores it fancy that all right kitis
[2599.88 - 2607.84] shingles boom non rashing
[2604.60 - 2610.64] colitis you guys know anybody with
[2607.84 - 2613.88] colitis anybody diagnosed the colitis at
[2610.64 - 2616.24] all do you know somebody that might be
[2613.88 - 2618.44] suffering with colitis if you guys are

[2624.64 - 2627.64] because I could see there's a lot of
[2625.64 - 2630.56] trouble on IG
[2627.64 - 2632.96] today okay medical communities don't
[2630.56 - 2635.12] know that this virus is responsible for
[2632.96 - 2636.76] almost all cases of colitis you can
[2635.12 - 2638.56] watch me stream live live right now I'm
[2636.76 - 2640.96] live right now at medicalmedium.com just
[2638.56 - 2643.76] go to medical medium.com and watch this
[2640.96 - 2645.76] okay Colitis symptoms include intestinal
[2643.76 - 2647.32] pain blood in the stool weakness and
[2645.76 - 2649.44] weight loss
[2647.32 - 2651.48] colitis colitis has always been a
[2649.44 - 2653.80] mystery illness and will continue to be
[2651.48 - 2656.84] so until medical research reveals that
[2653.80 - 2660.28] it's a variety of shingles colitis will
[2656.84 - 2663.88] be a mysterious illness for years to
[2660.28 - 2665.00] come unless medical research and science
[2663.88 - 2666.72] says
[2665.00 - 2668.12] uncle
[2666.72 - 2670.48] and
[2668.12 - 2674.56] literally chalks it
[2670.48 - 2675.76] up and admits it's a variety of shingles
[2674.56 - 2677.72] the only way they're going to do that is
[2675.76 - 2681.20] if they poach and steal something else
[2677.72 - 2683.52] from this book which will be
[2681.20 - 2685.60] this medical research and science
[2683.52 - 2687.52] believe colitis is an autoimmune
[2685.60 - 2690.88] condition where the immune system is
[2687.52 - 2690.88] attacking the lining of the
[2692.01 - 2697.12] [Music]
[2693.20 - 2700.40] colon oh my God
[2697.12 - 2704.40] tired and and freaking
[2700.40 - 2707.20] bored tired and freaking bored
[2704.40 - 2710.40] man excuse
[2707.20 - 2715.16] me I'm
[2710.40 - 2718.92] just I'm going to take a nap I'm so ti
[2715.16 - 2721.04] so so tired of the
[2718.92 - 2722.80]  medical research and science
[2721.04 - 2724.04] believes colitis is in autoimmune
[2722.80 - 2725.64] condition where the immune system is
[2724.04 - 2731.36] attacking the lining of the colon with
[2725.64 - 2733.04] no no evidence and no data and no
[2731.36 - 2735.64] studies showing
[2733.04 - 2737.40] it they believe it's just your body
[2735.64 - 2739.72] attacking the inside lining of the colon
[2737.40 - 2741.32] causing inflammation this belief means
[2739.72 - 2744.68] that doctors typically try to treat
[2741.32 - 2747.72] Colitis with immunosuppressive drugs
[2744.68 - 2749.40] even worse antibiotics which make the
[2747.72 - 2751.72] virus
[2749.40 - 2754.12] stronger so that personal colitis
[2751.72 - 2757.04] suffers
[2754.12 - 2759.32] more steroids can put put the colitis in
[2757.04 - 2761.84] remission but no one's addressing the
[2759.32 - 2763.92] true nature of it which is the shingles
[2761.84 - 2767.56] virus all
[2763.92 - 2772.24] right okay guys arm and leg burning
[2767.56 - 2774.60] shingles burning arms burning legs does
[2772.24 - 2775.64] it ring a bell to anybody you know
[2774.60 - 2779.48] burning
[2775.64 - 2781.92] arms burning legs just just seeing it
[2779.48 - 2785.88] sounds familiar boots McGee thank

[2799.40 - 2806.12] based strains that attack arm or legs
[2804.20 - 2808.08] with this strain the nerve inflammation
[2806.12 - 2810.36] and Burning Sensations all take place
[2808.08 - 2813.64] far below the skin so you can't pinpoint
[2810.36 - 2816.52] or find relief your arms burn your legs
[2813.64 - 2819.00] burn you can have just legs
[2816.52 - 2821.84] sometimes arms but really sometimes it's
[2819.00 - 2824.12] both and you can really suffer with that
[2821.84 - 2826.56] and they'll never know 50 years from now
[2824.12 - 2828.88] they might finally kind of come up with
[2826.56 - 2833.12] maybe that was shingles all
[2828.88 - 2835.44] along here's one right here okay mouth
[2833.12 - 2838.20] shingles
[2835.44 - 2843.92] TMJ trinal
[2838.20 - 2847.88] neuralgia Bells py Bells py
[2843.92 - 2851.64] okay the only way ever the medical
[2847.88 - 2854.32] industry ever Associated Belle's paly in
[2851.64 - 2856.08] any way to viral if it was ever going to
[2854.32 - 2857.40] be shingles would it would have to be a
[2856.08 - 2861.56] rashing
[2857.40 - 2865.76] version a rashing version
[2861.56 - 2867.92] okay now the medical industry has taken
[2865.76 - 2871.72] the bell's paly information from medical
[2867.92 - 2875.28] medium book one and now they're using
[2871.72 - 2877.20] it okay this virus affects the gums or
[2875.28 - 2879.20] the area of the jaw different area of
[2877.20 - 2881.84] the jaw gum burning
[2879.20 - 2883.92] gums right it's also responsible for
[2881.84 - 2886.60] Bell's paly viral inflammation of
[2883.92 - 2889.76] critical facial nerves fasal nerves
[2886.60 - 2891.72] trigeminal neuralgia and TMJ disorders a
[2889.76 - 2894.12] result of trigeminal nerve inflammation
[2891.72 - 2896.24] and pain people don't realize I had so
[2894.12 - 2897.80] many arguments with people in the health
[2896.24 - 2901.56] movement throughout the years whether
[2897.80 - 2904.88] they're like aw TMJ is the mandible
[2901.56 - 2907.88] joint it's not it's it's it's not it's
[2904.88 - 2911.00] when someone's joint is worn out and
[2907.88 - 2913.28] it's not shingles I'd be like really
[2911.00 - 2917.44] because their joint is inflamed that's
[2913.28 - 2920.84] how it wore out their jaw was
[2917.44 - 2922.40] inflamed hence it was in
[2920.84 - 2927.04] pain
[2922.40 - 2929.88] before the jaw fell apart on the person
[2927.04 - 2933.12] they suffered in pain they were inflamed
[2929.88 - 2935.60] in the jaw and then 20 years of it their
[2933.12 - 2938.04] joint just started to fall apart yeah
[2935.60 - 2941.20] you had to have the shingles there first
[2938.04 - 2945.00] the shingles had to be there first and
[2941.20 - 2947.88] then the TMJ the mandible joint stuff
[2945.00 - 2947.88] had to happen
[2949.92 - 2955.68] later it's really frustrating it's
[2953.20 - 2958.56] frequent frequently mistaken for a
[2955.68 - 2961.60] dental issue leading to unnecessary root
[2958.56 - 2965.64] canals let's do one more ranal let's do
[2961.60 - 2968.92] one more ranal we'll do another ranal oh
[2965.64 - 2971.04] oh crap 10 root canals later we didn't
[2968.92 - 2972.72] know something else is going on in there
[2971.04 - 2976.24] but science of research hasn't figured
[2972.72 - 2978.60] it out Juliet lellan says I think I have
[2976.24 - 2981.68] non- rashing shingles causing TMJ right
[2978.60 - 2984.04] jaw pain and pain in my right side of
[2981.68 - 2986.36] the face and ear on and off for a few
[2984.04 - 2991.00] years I can't seem to get rid of it and
[2986.36 - 2994.52] currently it's worst it's worst post
[2991.00 - 2996.60] dentist okay um all right you guys so I
[2994.52 - 2997.84] was doing that with the Bells py and and
[2996.60 - 3001.80] so
[2997.84 - 3001.80] forth Okay frozen
[3001.96 - 3008.16] shoulder who there got the frozen
[3005.36 - 3010.36] shoulder frozen
[3008.16 - 3011.76] shoulder frozen shoulder is brutal for
[3010.36 - 3014.88] so many people I've seen people where
[3011.76 - 3017.96] they're so Frozen so Frozen They're
[3014.88 - 3020.04] disabled they're disabled like they're
[3017.96 - 3022.60] they're literally in a
[3020.04 - 3024.72] sling and they they get the massage they
[3022.60 - 3026.56] get the they get work done on it they're
[3024.72 - 3029.40] at the doctor every minute frozen
[3026.56 - 3034.76] shoulder and it's brutal like it just
[3029.40 - 3037.24] seized up viral frozen shoulder shingles
[3034.76 - 3039.08] virus causes causes the frozen shoulder
[3037.24 - 3041.56] it's another thing science research
[3039.08 - 3043.44] actually took from the medical medium
[3041.56 - 3045.68] book The
[3043.44 - 3047.12] Original right there it's where the
[3045.68 - 3050.08] information comes
[3047.12 - 3051.96] from this virus aggravates the nerves in
[3050.08 - 3055.00] the shoulder causing it to freeze up for
[3051.96 - 3056.92] anywhere a month or a year you guys I've
[3055.00 - 3059.08] seen people with frozen shoulder for a
[3056.92 - 3060.72] year they've had it for a year or more
[3059.08 - 3062.44] because the shingles virus was freezing
[3060.72 - 3064.64] their shoulder this condition is often
[3062.44 - 3068.00] misdiagnosed as infectious
[3064.64 - 3071.16] btis oh it's just a case of btis what
[3068.00 - 3073.52] the hell is btis that's not an answer
[3071.16 - 3077.00] you can put any name you want on it Wing
[3073.52 - 3080.08] itis veritis whatever you can call it
[3077.00 - 3081.80] whatever you want you know and so the
[3080.08 - 3084.16] thing is is what people don't realize
[3081.80 - 3087.00] that's not an answer but shingles the
[3084.16 - 3089.92] virus created the
[3087.00 - 3091.64] btis see how it works medical me
[3089.92 - 3093.20] information did this for people that's
[3091.64 - 3095.12] why it was so mindblowing that's why
[3093.20 - 3097.56] it's been a movement all around the
[3095.12 - 3099.88] world I never had to do marketing I
[3097.56 - 3102.28] never had to you know hire PR and
[3099.88 - 3103.64] massive marketing firms like everybody's
[3102.28 - 3105.28] doing right now in the health realm
[3103.64 - 3106.56] including people in the medical Med
[3105.28 - 3109.24] community that used to be in the medical
[3106.56 - 3110.76] M community and their influencers and
[3109.24 - 3112.84] they've taken all their followers and
[3110.76 - 3114.96] ran and they're just they're hiring all
[3112.84 - 3117.60] these marketing companies helping the
[3114.96 - 3120.72] market everything never did that medical
[3117.60 - 3123.80] medium information no we never did that
[3120.72 - 3125.92] it was just about boom answers people
[3123.80 - 3128.24] found it and told someone else that's
[3125.92 - 3130.44] how it was done real answers people
[3128.24 - 3133.20] found it and told somebody some somebody
[3130.44 - 3135.76] else and what happens is that to know
[3133.20 - 3137.64] this right btis isn't an answer but what
[3135.76 - 3140.32] the medical medium information did was
[3137.64 - 3141.16] it said no there is something CA causing
[3140.32 - 3143.64] your
[3141.16 - 3147.20] btis there's something causing your
[3143.64 - 3149.84] frozen shoulder it's a shingles virus
[3147.20 - 3153.68] but more than that protocol for the
[3149.84 - 3157.20] shingles virus so you can heal faster or
[3153.68 - 3160.16] heal when people can't heal right all
[3157.20 - 3163.28] right here's one right here I don't like
[3160.16 - 3166.00] this shingles I don't like the shingles
[3163.28 - 3168.68] topic I don't like talking about the
[3166.00 - 3171.12] shingles I find it very frustrating in
[3168.68 - 3174.32] many ways one is because people have
[3171.12 - 3177.96] been tortured to death by shinkles out
[3174.32 - 3179.68] there in their health and throughout
[3177.96 - 3181.28] their struggling and suffering shingles
[3179.68 - 3183.08] has really done a lot of damage to
[3181.28 - 3185.28] people and it breaks my heart so it's
[3183.08 - 3188.64] it's a tough one for me it hits the
[3185.28 - 3190.92] emotional Core Body on fire shingles I
[3188.64 - 3193.12] do not like this variety I've seen
[3190.92 - 3196.96] people out there they've gone through
[3193.12 - 3198.84] this this one really really stinks okay
[3196.96 - 3202.48] this virus makes every part of your body
[3198.84 - 3207.32] feel like it's on fire like third degree
[3202.48 - 3209.44] burns on fire Sim ously and relentlessly
[3207.32 - 3211.60] it operates by finding a central
[3209.44 - 3213.36] location by the ganglia deep in the
[3211.60 - 3216.32] nervous system and releasing its
[3213.36 - 3218.64] neurotoxin this is a variety of shingles
[3216.32 - 3220.32] that gets into that different areas like
[3218.64 - 3221.80] the cranial area and so forth cranial
[3220.32 - 3223.24] nerves which spreads throughout the
[3221.80 - 3225.12] whole body and inflames nerves
[3223.24 - 3228.08] everywhere needless to say it creates a
[3225.12 - 3229.44] great deal of anxiety and fear and these
[3228.08 - 3232.12] challenging
[3229.44 - 3235.48] emotions can prompt the adrenal glands
[3232.12 - 3237.36] to produce an abundant amount of intense
[3235.48 - 3239.80] adrenal
[3237.36 - 3241.92] hormones there's shingles varieties like
[3239.80 - 3245.08] this one that creates this problem where
[3241.92 - 3247.28] the the adrenals are flooding like crazy
[3245.08 - 3249.00] because the virus inflammation is
[3247.28 - 3250.92] causing so much trouble in the nervous
[3249.00 - 3252.96] system and the nerves are inflamed INF
[3250.92 - 3256.08] flared up and the adrenals are just
[3252.96 - 3258.76] exploding with adrenaline and that's
[3256.08 - 3260.44] part of why this thing turns into a fear
[3258.76 - 3262.24] monster there are shingles varieties
[3260.44 - 3265.44] that are this
[3262.24 - 3267.44] bad this in this is an ESP special
[3265.44 - 3271.08] terrible shingles condition but
[3267.44 - 3272.96] thankfully relatively rare keep in mind
[3271.08 - 3276.00] that the body always has the ability to
[3272.96 - 3278.72] heal even from this uncommon
[3276.00 - 3280.84] variety it has the it has the ability to
[3278.72 - 3284.04] heal when given the right tools and so
[3280.84 - 3286.76] forth all right here's so I want to read

[3292.24 - 3297.48] that creates a rash or doesn't it can
[3295.08 - 3299.56] can be maddening okay fortunately there
