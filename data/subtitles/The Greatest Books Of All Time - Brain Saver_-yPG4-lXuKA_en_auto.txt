[2245.68 - 2250.24] all this gimmicky stuff and it's like
[2247.48 - 2252.70] they just started eating better and
[2250.24 - 2254.50] and everybody forgets like where were
[2252.70 - 2255.94] they five years ago it's just crazy how
[2254.50 - 2257.68] it works yeah I know it's not making
[2255.94 - 2258.94] total sense because you have there's so
[2257.68 - 2260.98] much to talk about with that but believe
[2258.94 - 2263.56] me there's so much
[2260.98 - 2265.42] so I mean just symptoms and conditions
[2263.56 - 2270.52] right here
[2265.42 - 2272.20] and it's endless humidity sensitivity
[2270.52 - 2273.58] right and I talk about all this what I'm
[2272.20 - 2275.62] talking about inside the book heat
[2273.58 - 2277.80] sensitivity
[2275.62 - 2279.88] hunting hens disease
[2277.80 - 2281.86] hyperpigmentation how many people are
[2279.88 - 2285.46] dealing with hyperpigmentation impulse
[2281.86 - 2288.88] control issues inflammatory myopathy and
[2285.46 - 2290.32] influenza inner ear disease insomnia it
[2288.88 - 2292.30] keeps on going
[2290.32 - 2294.28] there's so much here muscle weakness
[2292.30 - 2298.08] muscle spasms when you go in here
[2294.28 - 2302.68] there's over 300 symptoms conditions
[2298.08 - 2305.68] and I explain in detail so many of them
[2302.68 - 2308.74] Casey says which book will have info on
[2305.68 - 2311.38] cyclic vomiting syndrome for children
[2308.74 - 2313.84] pick up pick up both books is what I
[2311.38 - 2317.08] recommend for everybody because they're
[2313.84 - 2321.46] both they were one book one giant book
[2317.08 - 2323.62] and I we couldn't publish it we could
[2321.46 - 2325.66] it was one giant book it was impossible
[2323.62 - 2327.76] for the printer to print it out
[2325.66 - 2330.40] and it couldn't be published
[2327.76 - 2332.62] had to break them into two
[2330.40 - 2335.44] massive books
[2332.62 - 2336.88] how to break them into two so just so
[2335.44 - 2339.58] you know
[2336.88 - 2341.68] getting both books is is really critical
[2339.58 - 2343.60] sure you can start with one and then
[2341.68 - 2345.70] eventually get the other if you'd like
[2343.60 - 2349.06] but I recommend getting them both
[2345.70 - 2352.60] because they were one huge big book
[2349.06 - 2355.72] and it's just how it rolled when you're
[2352.60 - 2357.04] trying to help heal people with chronic
[2355.72 - 2360.64] illness
[2357.04 - 2362.68] and you're trying to understand
[2360.64 - 2365.38] what they're going through
[2362.68 - 2367.78] and you're trying to do them Justice you
[2365.38 - 2371.02] can't make pamphlets eat better books
[2367.78 - 2372.82] that are just so many pages
[2371.02 - 2374.56] and they're basically just eat better
[2372.82 - 2375.82] books that are pamphlets and then start
[2374.56 - 2378.52] up a podcast and now you're an eat
[2375.82 - 2381.70] better doctor you can't on a podcast you
[2378.52 - 2384.70] can't insult the chronically ill
[2381.70 - 2385.90] and then bring on guests that
[2384.70 - 2387.82] don't know what they're talking about
[2385.90 - 2389.56] about chronic illness it's like you have
[2387.82 - 2392.50] to treat The Chronic allele with the
[2389.56 - 2393.70] utmost critical respect possible and you
[2392.50 - 2395.44] have to understand what they've gone
[2393.70 - 2397.42] through and you have to make sure you
[2395.44 - 2400.92] have answers for them
[2397.42 - 2405.34] and so I couldn't make a brain saver
[2400.92 - 2407.38] pamphlet brain saver small book I had to
[2405.34 - 2409.42] make sure that we're talking about the
[2407.38 - 2413.64] brain comprehensive detail information
[2409.42 - 2413.64] and answers have to be there
[2413.92 - 2417.52] so both the books are critical I'm
[2416.08 - 2418.60] giving you guys just to run down right
[2417.52 - 2421.12] now
[2418.60 - 2422.92] all the details are in both these brain
[2421.12 - 2425.02] saver books
