[133.38 - 139.50] with them and then we came across antony
[136.29 - 142.38] and it was such a random moment for me I
[139.50 - 145.05] was on a wedding weekend with friends
[142.38 - 149.61] and there is this girl reading this book
[145.05 - 154.08] the first book and and I'm like who is
[149.61 - 156.36] bringing this you know can chest scan
[154.08 - 157.83] you know on the wedding weekend like
[156.36 - 159.24] people are usually you know reading
[157.83 - 164.94] novel something yeah and he's bringing
[159.24 - 167.91] an x-ray and she was really reading like
[164.94 - 170.22] properly and then she I was like what
[167.91 - 171.51] are you reading and she goes like Elena
[170.22 - 174.54] you won't believe it this is gonna
[171.51 - 177.15] change your life in it and here it is it
[174.54 - 179.04] changed my life honestly I am so
[177.15 - 180.87] grateful for everything you do on all
[179.04 - 183.09] the channels you do because you are
[180.87 - 185.13] really working your butt off to reach
[183.09 - 186.99] every single person out there there's so
[185.13 - 188.79] many people struggling out there I mean
[186.99 - 190.14] you know it's like a war zone out there
[188.79 - 191.79] people don't realize that and I say what
[190.14 - 193.44] am i living in a bubble and nobody's
[191.79 - 195.33] sick out there so science of research
[193.44 - 197.22] fixed everything so science research
[195.33 - 200.16] must have everything fixed no one's sick
[197.22 - 203.42] out there so but that's not true I mean
[200.16 - 208.26] just in America alone over 250 million
[203.42 - 210.51] citizens just you know 250 million alone
[208.26 - 214.38] or suffering here you know it's
[210.51 - 218.43] incredible my resolutions and and
[214.38 - 220.29] honestly I was never in or I came to
[218.43 - 223.29] this knowledge for me all the motivation
[220.29 - 224.76] comes as how I can be the healthiest you
[223.29 - 227.07] know what is the healthiest we can be
[224.76 - 228.72] and then you talk about that and you
[227.07 - 231.57] talk about us as people rather than
[228.72 - 233.43] patients and all these symptoms we have
[231.57 - 236.13] because I have plenty of symptoms that I
[233.43 - 237.78] never qualify them as a part of
[236.13 - 238.80] something because we're supposed to
[237.78 - 240.72] think it's normal
[238.80 - 243.09] yes I tell you guys out there only time
[240.72 - 245.31] rate how many times I asked you about it
[243.09 - 247.11] like yeah can you tell me what is the
[245.31 - 249.78] healthiest I can feel today in this
[247.11 - 251.76] society with all the toxins that are
[249.78 - 253.29] happening around us you know we are
[251.76 - 255.81] breeding in and eat
[253.29 - 257.04] and what is the healthiest we can be you
[255.81 - 258.84] know it's a lot more time the funny
[257.04 - 261.42] thing is a lot more toxic now than it
[258.84 - 263.52] ever was when you think about the cities
[261.42 - 265.80] in the old days you know have you ever
[263.52 - 269.94] hear like stories of you got to move out
[265.80 - 274.05] of the city to get to the country this
[269.94 - 275.82] guy right there on the left side saying
[274.05 - 277.71] to me you couldn't you've got to stay
[275.82 - 279.87] out of LA for now there is this fight
[277.71 - 281.28] wildfire the wildfires yeah that's right
[279.87 - 283.23] and there are so many people who didn't
[281.28 - 285.18] go out of LA had to stay and breathe in
[283.23 - 287.31] all the toxins and so how do they feel
[285.18 - 289.02] now well you know it together wildfires
[287.31 - 291.60] and then the fire retardant that sprayed
[289.02 - 293.43] and all the dust and all the ashes and
[291.60 - 295.38] so we're always up get something whether
[293.43 - 297.36] it's that or any kind of anything else
[295.38 - 299.49] that's just added extra stuff that no
[297.36 - 301.68] one needs so ease it a solution to move
[299.49 - 303.45] to countryside well you know what it is
[301.68 - 304.80] though it's like the cities used to be
[303.45 - 307.17] like I always say the cities are really
[304.80 - 309.09] dirty and cities are dirty and go to the
[307.17 - 310.65] country and that was many years ago and
[309.09 - 313.41] I've never told you guys about this but
[310.65 - 315.06] they talk about this but now the cities
[313.41 - 316.98] are worse than they've ever been and the
[315.06 - 318.99] country is also not good either where
[316.98 - 322.14] we're always exposed to something every
[318.99 - 324.30] basically there's no everybody's exposed
[322.14 - 326.46] in every place it doesn't matter where
[324.30 - 329.10] it is every country the city it could be
[326.46 - 330.51] anywhere and so we have to take care of
[329.10 - 331.80] ourselves we have to learn and take care
[330.51 - 333.15] of ourselves that's the whole point it's
[331.80 - 334.47] not that we're supposed to run and hide
[333.15 - 337.37] it's not supposed to that we're supposed
[334.47 - 339.66] to meaning never get it ever affected or
[337.37 - 342.15] intoxicated by anything it's not that
[339.66 - 344.04] it's just that where we need to take
[342.15 - 346.44] care of ourselves we need to do things
[344.04 - 348.27] and the medical medium information is
[346.44 - 349.65] what I you know always read out there
[348.27 - 351.39] and say look you got to take care of
[349.65 - 355.40] your liver because it collects it all
[351.39 - 355.40] that's why you like liver book probably
[356.33 - 361.59] for me the book that I carry around a
[359.91 - 366.93] lot even though it's the heaviest one
[361.59 - 369.03] and is this one and luckily it's also
[366.93 - 371.46] translated in Serbian so when I speak
[369.03 - 373.98] with my friends and family I also make
[371.46 - 376.08] sure I refer them to the book and trust
[373.98 - 378.24] me you are big because if it's
[376.08 - 381.18] translated in serve in translated in
[378.24 - 383.37] surgeon I mean that's your ultimate goal
[381.18 - 385.05] you want to reach those kind of people
[383.37 - 385.78] because they are open to knowledge I
[385.05 - 388.33] mean I'm saying
[385.78 - 389.77] to everybody from Serbia don't go down
[388.33 - 393.13] you don't go back to prospects either
[389.77 - 395.56] Cosmo and I'm just telling them go guys
[393.13 - 398.11] by the books I'm also speaking about it
[395.56 - 401.26] also in on all my channels because for
[398.11 - 403.30] me this is the knowledge I am I applied
[401.26 - 405.52] to my children's lives in my life and
[403.30 - 408.75] also my husband is using lots of those
[405.52 - 412.09] now lots of that kind of knowledge and
[408.75 - 415.09] it's a Holy Grail you know if you want
[412.09 - 417.73] to feel energized and youthful through
[415.09 - 421.18] life because we don't feel that way and
[417.73 - 422.98] that's what healthy means yeah yeah when
[421.18 - 425.35] we walk around with symptoms we think
[422.98 - 427.42] it's normal it's a new norm new norm to
[425.35 - 429.70] have endometriosis normal to have PCOS
[427.42 - 430.21] fibroids in norm to have all these
[429.70 - 432.76] issues
[430.21 - 434.65] Divac diabetes new norm to actually have
[432.76 - 437.05] high a1c high blood sure
[434.65 - 438.43] you know hypoglycemia thyroid problems
[437.05 - 440.80] so we walk around we all have
[438.43 - 442.36] hypothyroid right and we walk around
[440.80 - 443.86] with it and it's just it's the new
[442.36 - 444.97] normal we're just supposed to accept it
[443.86 - 446.26] and then we're supposed to believe
[444.97 - 447.94] science that research has all the
[446.26 - 449.26] answers for some reason so we're
[447.94 - 451.12] supposed to believe in all the studies
[449.26 - 453.40] and all the science is thrown around and
[451.12 - 455.11] and the vegans have all the answers and
[453.40 - 456.88] then the Palio's have all the answers in
[455.11 - 461.08] the animal protein high-protein low
[456.88 - 463.81] protein high fat they're not healthy
[461.08 - 466.18] it's like it doesn't work that way being
[463.81 - 468.19] labeled as vegan also brings out
[466.18 - 470.77] different kinds of food that we eat that
[468.19 - 474.67] are not the healthiest option for us a
[470.77 - 476.74] fried french fries that's vegan food but
[474.67 - 478.81] is it the best one for you so a lot of
[476.74 - 482.05] vegans don't eat good that's a you need
[478.81 - 483.40] right yeah yeah totally and this is
[482.05 - 485.98] what's gonna happen because there is a
[483.40 - 488.53] huge vegan trend that is actually
[485.98 - 490.09] sending us off the rails because we're
[488.53 - 492.10] gonna get even sicker because we're
[490.09 - 494.08] eating lab food as well because you know
[492.10 - 495.91] those burgers out there are sausages or
[494.08 - 498.60] cheese you mean that the fake sausages
[495.91 - 501.10] the fake means that I got all those
[498.60 - 503.83] absolutely and last tried them they do
[501.10 - 505.60] they do taste well but they feel bad
[503.83 - 506.64] after and like my body does not let me
[505.60 - 509.64] do those things
[506.64 - 511.65] it's just alerts me straight on and I am
[509.64 - 513.51] skinny but that's how I feel good not
[511.65 - 515.31] about looking good it's about feeling
[513.51 - 517.77] good and this is what people don't know
[515.31 - 519.54] what it is well if a plant-based person
[517.77 - 521.37] if the person who's doing the vegan food
[519.54 - 524.16] right and they're eating all of these
[521.37 - 525.54] fun vegan foods all the time and they
[524.16 - 527.07] get their first symptoms or they get
[525.54 - 529.80] symptoms they think it's because they're
[527.07 - 531.42] plant-based so then they leave the
[529.80 - 533.04] plant-based world they leave that the u
[531.42 - 534.33] n-- is immoral then they had to eating
[533.04 - 535.77] animal proteins again because their
[534.33 - 537.09] doctor might say it's because you don't
[535.77 - 538.47] have proteins it's because you're not
[537.09 - 540.39] getting your proteins not getting enough
[538.47 - 541.77] proteins but maybe they weren't eating
[540.39 - 543.24] as good as they could have when they're
[541.77 - 544.86] eating plant-based and I say that to
[543.24 - 547.56] people who are paleo too or people who
[544.86 - 549.42] are doing a healthy keto maybe it could
[547.56 - 552.03] be even better because that's the thing
[549.42 - 553.41] we could be doing a better job in all of
[552.03 - 554.91] our diets that's what I try to do right
[553.41 - 556.29] I try to get the information out there
[554.91 - 557.61] so it's like hey if you want to be
[556.29 - 559.83] plant-based you gotta do it
[557.61 - 562.23] this way make sure you get this in you
[559.83 - 563.88] and she's gotta stay strong on this we
[562.23 - 567.54] got our celery juices by the way we have
[563.88 - 569.70] that I'm not having anymore I had two of
[567.54 - 572.52] these before the live started it's
[569.70 - 578.58] enough I need to keep the pretty face
[572.52 - 581.91] otherwise it's a lot of celery juice
[578.58 - 584.43] yeah but so you know and yeah it's it's
[581.91 - 587.46] no matter what diet we subscribe to a
[584.43 - 591.66] belief system we get sucked into there's
[587.46 - 593.52] information out there that you know no
[591.66 - 595.95] there's information about what's really
[593.52 - 597.12] causing our illnesses that I'm trying to
[595.95 - 598.23] spread out there and you're trying to
[597.12 - 599.31] spread that information out there
[598.23 - 601.02] because you're doing that you're telling
[599.31 - 603.09] everybody about this information and so
[601.02 - 605.76] that when you're plant-based or vegan
[603.09 - 607.62] you don't get scared when you get when
[605.76 - 609.48] you're having a symptom and you're
[607.62 - 611.01] thinking it's because of lack protein or
[609.48 - 613.53] it's because I'm vegan or because I'm
[611.01 - 616.23] not doing something right because the
[613.53 - 618.03] chase for protein that is the properties
[616.23 - 619.71] for proteins and that's brilliant
[618.03 - 622.20] that's brilliant well you know I I
[619.71 - 624.51] texted you a few weeks ago telling you
[622.20 - 626.94] yeah a friend of mine a close friend of
[624.51 - 630.78] mine was you know having some mystery
[626.94 - 633.63] weighed his shoes and it wasn't it
[630.78 - 636.84] actually the doctor sent to her to kick
[633.63 - 639.51] out all the fruits and all the veggies
[636.84 - 641.66] and just go for the meat and the fat
[639.51 - 645.15] yes that's gonna be like her healing
[641.66 - 648.81] okay so just go totally totally no carb
[645.15 - 651.42] no fruit yeah because because it's
[648.81 - 656.16] qualified as sugar and sugar is you know
[651.42 - 659.19] making her sick sick and I lost it I was
[656.16 - 661.47] like just let's let's keep the book out
[659.19 - 663.48] let's start reading and then let's see
[661.47 - 664.20] and the thing is how do you go against
[663.48 - 666.30] the doctor
[664.20 - 667.74] you know like doctors are advising or
[666.30 - 669.39] certain things of course first of all
[667.74 - 672.57] when you see the doctor today are they
[669.39 - 675.06] actually looking as we would want to
[672.57 - 676.68] look you know as healthy so then they
[675.06 - 678.36] also come because of course for them
[676.68 - 680.94] it's like they're constantly seeing sick
[678.36 - 682.23] people and trying to help them do they
[680.94 - 684.03] have time to keep up with all the
[682.23 - 686.04] knowledge that is out there I'm so
[684.03 - 687.93] excited you partner with doctors and you
[686.04 - 689.58] make sure that they also get the access
[687.93 - 691.62] to that because it's so important
[689.58 - 693.48] they're the ones people come to when
[691.62 - 695.04] they see people in the white coats they
[693.48 - 696.90] are like okay this is the person that
[695.04 - 699.21] will save me and it's true they're gonna
[696.90 - 701.85] save us but in some really you know
[699.21 - 704.49] dangerous situations like broken arms
[701.85 - 706.20] and you know car accidents or things
[704.49 - 708.87] like that are serious serious serious
[706.20 - 710.52] but then for this everyday illnesses
[708.87 - 711.96] that we carry on through life this is
[710.52 - 714.72] what we need this information for
[711.96 - 717.48] because we're fueling our body with the
[714.72 - 719.61] wrong fuel yeah and and I'm so happy
[717.48 - 722.28] what you've mentioned in so many of your
[719.61 - 724.62] books is that being repetitive with food
[722.28 - 727.05] is not bad for us no everybody speaks
[724.62 - 729.48] about variety changing it off spicing it
[727.05 - 731.88] up right they need the variety what do
[729.48 - 732.90] you say about that look like it's okay
[731.88 - 734.70] if you're doing where you're not doing
[732.90 - 737.01] variety where you just do something that
[734.70 - 738.69] works that's another thing too I know
[737.01 - 740.85] that a lot of us want variety and I
[738.69 - 743.06] totally respect that not or that right
[740.85 - 746.10] and and I think people get bored fast
[743.06 - 748.02] and they get pressured you get pressured
[746.10 - 749.88] by people around them my family might be
[748.02 - 751.71] friends and are you eating those
[749.88 - 753.81] potatoes again those steamed potatoes
[751.71 - 755.88] again are you eating that sounds like my
[753.81 - 757.86] son loves it I think I'm saying hello to
[755.88 - 760.29] all the moms out there because I'm sure
[757.86 - 762.84] that your kids love potatoes and I am
[760.29 - 764.79] you know my son also eats them for
[762.84 - 766.65] breakfast like he just likes them you
[764.79 - 769.80] know and I mean okay he eats a lot of
[766.65 - 771.87] fruits and then she will just go at 11
[769.80 - 772.44] o'clock for potatoes and I'm not gonna
[771.87 - 774.63] stop him
[772.44 - 781.86] because I know now because I've read the
[774.63 - 783.72] life I mean this is something that is so
[781.86 - 785.49] precious to me yeah because it doesn't
[783.72 - 786.93] like I love the fact that would your
[785.49 - 788.88] speak when you speak about the food
[786.93 - 790.59] you're not only giving this nutritional
[788.88 - 793.47] fact you're actually giving the soul
[790.59 - 795.30] feeding fact that every every food we
[793.47 - 797.22] eat is feeding our soul - with
[795.30 - 798.69] information that is so crucial that's
[797.22 - 799.47] why I connect with you because you speak
[798.69 - 801.66] to my soul
[799.47 - 803.34] well the wild blueberries those are
[801.66 - 804.87] powerful for the soul I talked about
[803.34 - 807.57] that in the book oh they're really
[804.87 - 808.80] powerful really healing and and that's a
[807.57 - 813.36] crime and that's good for the heavy
[808.80 - 814.95] metal detox which is I'm using from all
[813.36 - 817.92] the recommendations you're like this
[814.95 - 820.20] like the mornings the delivery rest good
[817.92 - 822.33] morning are you know it's kind of an
[820.20 - 823.95] intermittent fasting isn't it yeah it is
[822.33 - 826.50] you know it's funny but the heavy metals
[823.95 - 828.72] is people you know don't they don't
[826.50 - 829.74] think they have metals in them they
[828.72 - 830.85] don't think they have metals in they
[829.74 - 832.26] don't think they have mercury in them
[830.85 - 833.40] they don't think they have Lumina mentum
[832.26 - 834.72] you guys probably hear it all the time
[833.40 - 836.79] because so many of you talk about the
[834.72 - 840.12] metals out there arsenic lead cadmium
[836.79 - 841.89] nickel but in copper but if you have
[840.12 - 844.26] eczema if you have psoriasis you have
[841.89 - 847.20] your gift copper coppers inside the
[844.26 - 849.74] liver if you have twitches spasms brain
[847.20 - 852.39] fog tables numbness you've got mercury
[849.74 - 853.86] Mercury's in there you might be viral
[852.39 - 855.66] too I talk about that all times you've
[853.86 - 857.04] got mercury in there so if you got all
[855.66 - 858.96] of that the brain fog if you have
[857.04 - 861.11] sleeping problems mercury can be behind
[858.96 - 864.12] that too it could be behind so much
[861.11 - 865.56] confusion the way you know if we feel
[864.12 - 866.97] like we're confused if we feel like
[865.56 - 869.64] we're not getting our information across
[866.97 - 870.90] we can't see we can't talk so clearly or
[869.64 - 875.93] we can't think or we're getting the
[870.90 - 877.95] brain fog in the way in your home like -
[875.93 - 881.01] because that was something that I've
[877.95 - 884.37] just a few months ago discovered when we
[881.01 - 887.22] were our chef that was cooking for us at
[884.37 - 888.75] that time was you know wrapping the food
[887.22 - 891.33] in the aluminium foil
[888.75 - 893.16] yes warm to keep it warm yeah and I had
[891.33 - 895.41] the massive food poisoning without even
[893.16 - 896.88] you know understanding why it was you
[895.41 - 899.70] know and then when I realized that it
[896.88 - 901.62] was the aluminium that was and we use it
[899.70 - 902.03] every single day I grew up around like
[901.62 - 903.86] my
[902.03 - 905.69] I don't know my cousins were working in
[903.86 - 908.75] a factory that was doing that you know
[905.69 - 910.97] we taking that matter exactly and so all
[908.75 - 913.25] of us are getting sick from all the you
[910.97 - 916.55] know everyday use of shampoos and
[913.25 - 919.52] lotions and perfumes and all different
[916.55 - 921.53] kinds of things what I you know blows my
[919.52 - 923.33] mind is the idea of going to the shop
[921.53 - 925.70] and buying your new clothes and putting
[923.33 - 927.23] them on and you are also poisoning your
[925.70 - 929.12] body with that because somebody has used
[927.23 - 930.83] a mold spray or something on it yeah
[929.12 - 933.38] they use a fungicide all our new clothes
[930.83 - 934.97] that we get oh we go out my new clothes
[933.38 - 936.41] they spray it with fungicide they don't
[934.97 - 937.07] give you the choice there's no town hall
[936.41 - 940.07] meeting
[937.07 - 942.35] there's no choices there or not we're
[940.07 - 944.63] not giving that they just they just coat
[942.35 - 946.67] everything with fungicide fungicide is
[944.63 - 948.95] so toxic it goes to the brain it's
[946.67 - 951.71] filled with metals and so that's what we
[948.95 - 954.32] live in all of this stuff every day so
[951.71 - 956.42] sure I mean we're battling where the
[954.32 - 958.67] diet people are all fighting each other
[956.42 - 960.83] you got like Paquito people are all mad
[958.67 - 962.15] at the people who do a potato and and
[960.83 - 964.22] you got the people you mean the vegans
[962.15 - 965.84] are mad at the beet eater people and you
[964.22 - 968.42] got all everybody's throwing all this
[965.84 - 970.46] science at each other all these studies
[968.42 - 972.05] all this what I call fake science but
[970.46 - 973.64] nobody knows the cause of illnesses
[972.05 - 974.33] nobody knows that when they buy new
[973.64 - 977.09] clothes
[974.33 - 978.35] it's loaded with fungicide nobody knows
[977.09 - 979.67] that they're supposed to lower their
[978.35 - 981.29] fats because they're taking out their
[979.67 - 982.70] oxygen and because their oxygen is
[981.29 - 984.17] getting you know less and less in the
[982.70 - 985.82] body to fight disease so they're eating
[984.17 - 987.80] all these high fats and all these diets
[985.82 - 989.09] nobody knows any of this information so
[987.80 - 990.53] then everybody stays sick they're all
[989.09 - 991.94] getting sick so you might be vegan for a
[990.53 - 993.44] little why it might be keto for a little
[991.94 - 995.21] while you might be paleo for a little
[993.44 - 997.43] while you might be doing some diet and
[995.21 - 1002.26] you're feeling good for a while go back
[997.43 - 1003.76] to the five years later you know you're
[1002.26 - 1005.41] you might be doing on YouTube you're
[1003.76 - 1006.79] doing youtubes for years ago and you can
[1005.41 - 1009.76] follow the progression that four years
[1006.79 - 1011.92] later everybody gets better from it and
[1009.76 - 1013.90] then gets worse like I don't understand
[1011.92 - 1015.25] it like so many times you do something
[1013.90 - 1017.68] that is so good for you and you feel
[1015.25 - 1018.94] good and you commit to it but then I
[1017.68 - 1020.19] guess you have to take into
[1018.94 - 1023.17] consideration if your body's changing
[1020.19 - 1025.06] well there's a couple of things to when
[1023.17 - 1028.06] we usually jump into something we're
[1025.06 - 1029.41] usually eating worse before that so for
[1028.06 - 1031.94] instance like if you go to a healthy
[1029.41 - 1033.50] keto diet after being you know eating
[1031.94 - 1035.27] whatever or more you know you're eating
[1033.50 - 1037.49] more fast food or you're eating no
[1035.27 - 1039.38] process you don't see the diet is the
[1037.49 - 1041.00] new kind of high-protein diet but
[1039.38 - 1042.89] everybody gets mad if I say I protein
[1041.00 - 1044.78] because it's high fat and that's the
[1042.89 - 1046.94] whole thing but it's really it's really
[1044.78 - 1047.96] a lot of fat but the high protein diet
[1046.94 - 1050.21] is a lot of fat
[1047.96 - 1051.98] they're basically they're both filled
[1050.21 - 1054.11] with a lot of fat vegan diet is also
[1051.98 - 1056.60] high fat it's nice that yeah - that's
[1054.11 - 1060.37] why there's keto vegan now but the yeah
[1056.60 - 1062.69] but the keto diets is the high fat diet
[1060.37 - 1065.06] yeah the cute guys the high fat diet
[1062.69 - 1066.20] that's still high protein but and then
[1065.06 - 1068.57] you know but you got the high protein
[1066.20 - 1070.01] diet that's still high fat and then you
[1068.57 - 1071.39] got the key you got the vegan diets that
[1070.01 - 1073.49] are still high fat and all of this
[1071.39 - 1075.17] delivery suffers deliver suffering see
[1073.49 - 1077.00] the keto diet high fat or liver
[1075.17 - 1078.74] suffering you do high protein diet high
[1077.00 - 1081.11] fat your livers suffering you do you can
[1078.74 - 1083.12] package it name it anything you want but
[1081.11 - 1084.71] they all end up high fat diets they kill
[1083.12 - 1086.60] the liver the liver gets killed you
[1084.71 - 1088.58] knock down but people get better at
[1086.60 - 1089.96] first because they're lowering they're
[1088.58 - 1091.34] staying away from their chocolate cake
[1089.96 - 1094.10] they're staying away from their waffles
[1091.34 - 1096.95] they're staying away for their joy
[1094.10 - 1099.20] things like I mean you get stress from
[1096.95 - 1100.70] all this information like now knowing
[1099.20 - 1103.85] that everything you do everything you
[1100.70 - 1105.26] use it becomes so toxic for you so now
[1103.85 - 1106.64] there is a moment of panic right
[1105.26 - 1109.13] everybody's like oh my god but if this
[1106.64 - 1111.41] is how do I actually live this life and
[1109.13 - 1113.30] who do I trust and I mean so often
[1111.41 - 1115.19] people say but in this organic section
[1113.30 - 1118.07] there is like not a lot nice and looking
[1115.19 - 1120.50] fruit or veggie and it all looks very
[1118.07 - 1123.80] you know it's not appealing to people
[1120.50 - 1126.53] yeah so they give up before even they
[1123.80 - 1128.45] started because it's just not as yummy
[1126.53 - 1131.51] looking as that strawberry that is like
[1128.45 - 1134.12] this big or you know and so you were
[1131.51 - 1135.71] stuck with this fear because now all of
[1134.12 - 1137.99] a sudden knowing what's causing your
[1135.71 - 1140.66] illness is the new creating fear in you
[1137.99 - 1142.97] yeah and you are providing us with this
[1140.66 - 1145.19] information and giving us alternatives I
[1142.97 - 1148.40] love the idea of knowing that I can have
[1145.19 - 1150.86] you know a piece of fruit in 300 ways
[1148.40 - 1153.47] you know if well people are afraid of
[1150.86 - 1155.93] fruit there's fruit fear Oh big fruit
[1153.47 - 1157.52] fear out there big like big so eating
[1155.93 - 1159.41] all my life fruit more than anything
[1157.52 - 1162.73] else honestly it has given me life
[1159.41 - 1164.92] anything else I've been doing maybe not
[1162.73 - 1167.23] well what happens is the fruit fear is a
[1164.92 - 1169.30] funny thing because if someone gets sick
[1167.23 - 1171.34] they don't blame the egg that's fed
[1169.30 - 1173.44] every virus and pathogen and bacteria
[1171.34 - 1175.60] that causes their problems and they
[1173.44 - 1177.28] don't blame the egg but they'll blame
[1175.60 - 1179.29] the piece of fruit they have no one
[1177.28 - 1182.29] really ate fruit so why is everybody
[1179.29 - 1184.42] sick no one eats enough fruit and for
[1182.29 - 1188.07] anyone even determined fruits the reason
[1184.42 - 1188.07] why they're sick it's not even possible
[1191.55 - 1197.17] isn't healthier I wish it was but it'll
[1194.56 - 1199.75] still feed every bug in our body so the
[1197.17 - 1201.31] cause of illness are pathogens and
[1199.75 - 1203.08] toxins so you got the viruses of
[1201.31 - 1204.67] bacteria that's your pathogens and then
[1203.08 - 1206.80] you got the toxins and everybody has a
[1204.67 - 1208.45] minim and it's it's like Russian
[1206.80 - 1210.04] Roulette it's like it's like again it's
[1208.45 - 1211.66] like a gamble who's gonna get sick first
[1210.04 - 1213.40] who's gonna get knocked down and have
[1211.66 - 1215.50] the pathogen take over and give them
[1213.40 - 1217.63] aches and pains and fatigue and all
[1215.50 - 1219.22] kinds of problems and or what Thompson's
[1217.63 - 1220.81] are people gonna get intoxicated with
[1219.22 - 1223.36] like what metals and what different
[1220.81 - 1224.83] kinds of poisons like the you know all
[1223.36 - 1227.35] the different fungicide on clothes and
[1224.83 - 1228.79] the petrochemicals out there floating in
[1227.35 - 1231.31] the air and the mercury that's falling
[1228.79 - 1233.11] out of the sky so we get both the toxins
[1231.31 - 1234.91] so we get both the pathogens and then
[1233.11 - 1236.77] they both get they join together the
[1234.91 - 1238.33] pathogens eat the poisons and then we
[1236.77 - 1240.46] get sick and then everybody blames the
[1238.33 - 1242.98] strawberry everybody's going to blame
[1240.46 - 1246.10] the strawberry a very food that will
[1242.98 - 1249.13] actually help you get better everybody's
[1246.10 - 1250.69] going to blame it suggest more people
[1249.13 - 1252.73] who want to change their life because
[1250.69 - 1254.50] it's all about working out as well no I
[1252.73 - 1255.88] think people want to lose weight or
[1254.50 - 1258.19] people want to feel bad you know I've
[1255.88 - 1261.13] been doing this for 35 years maybe more
[1258.19 - 1264.25] than 35 years now and I've seen guys
[1261.13 - 1266.38] that are like in top shape top shape die
[1264.25 - 1268.45] of heart attacks just boom that's it 38
[1266.38 - 1270.52] years old they're in the gym they got
[1268.45 - 1272.62] their tabs they got their apps I know a
[1270.52 - 1274.51] lot of athletes I've helped a lot of
[1272.62 - 1277.33] athletes professionally over the decades
[1274.51 - 1279.49] and you can just you get one injury that
[1277.33 - 1281.53] won't heal you get you get something and
[1279.49 - 1283.33] you know you get a heart attack or
[1281.53 - 1284.92] something happens but there's there's
[1283.33 - 1286.15] ways to heal things there ways that will
[1284.92 - 1287.68] avoid that there's a way to heal
[1286.15 - 1289.27] injuries the way that you know do the
[1287.68 - 1291.22] body can heal but you got to give it
[1289.27 - 1293.41] what it needs you got to give it what it
[1291.22 - 1295.93] needs how do we know what our body needs
[1293.41 - 1300.19] for a particular thing like say
[1295.93 - 1302.08] or feel like I love the item I keep on
[1300.19 - 1304.32] speaking about it but honestly for me
[1302.08 - 1306.85] your books are really important guides
[1304.32 - 1309.61] so for instance when we have an injury
[1306.85 - 1312.13] when we for instance injured our knee
[1309.61 - 1313.60] and that's an injury that's gonna heal
[1312.13 - 1314.74] at some point right with all the
[1313.60 - 1317.02] different things you're doing your
[1314.74 - 1318.73] therapy and stuff and then after a while
[1317.02 - 1321.16] it's gonna come back again and it flares
[1318.73 - 1323.74] up when we are eating inflammatory foods
[1321.16 - 1325.90] yeah so that's the weak point for now
[1323.74 - 1327.91] forever in our body and that's where the
[1325.90 - 1330.13] viruses and bacteria are collecting and
[1327.91 - 1333.19] nesting when we when we injure ourselves
[1330.13 - 1335.74] and we have a pathogen in us we have say
[1333.19 - 1336.55] like a virus in us I've seen bar we
[1335.74 - 1338.59] injure ourselves
[1336.55 - 1340.00] the virus can go to that injury that's
[1338.59 - 1341.74] why there's so many people there's
[1340.00 - 1343.24] people who get knee surgeries and they
[1341.74 - 1344.44] get up and they walk out they're fine
[1343.24 - 1345.97] right after the knee surgery that
[1344.44 - 1347.77] literally I talk to doctors all the time
[1345.97 - 1349.84] about this they just get it they walk
[1347.77 - 1352.90] same pertinent this other person gets
[1349.84 - 1355.33] the same exact surgery same exactly
[1352.90 - 1356.62] problem to the T everything should be
[1355.33 - 1359.98] fine they should be up and walking
[1356.62 - 1361.81] bright out and then they're swollen for
[1359.98 - 1364.09] weeks and weeks and months and months
[1361.81 - 1365.59] and now on steroids and swollen and they
[1364.09 - 1367.57] can't walk good they need long-term
[1365.59 - 1370.42] physical therapy and it goes on a year
[1367.57 - 1372.13] of a knee problem because they had a
[1370.42 - 1374.47] low-grade viral infection in their
[1372.13 - 1377.11] system but we're do are you suggesting
[1374.47 - 1379.66] for them like I know for instance my dad
[1377.11 - 1381.55] when he had this injury that kept coming
[1379.66 - 1383.71] back he would they were suggesting him
[1381.55 - 1385.39] to use the collagen is that a good thing
[1383.71 - 1388.18] or not really well you can't build up
[1385.39 - 1390.61] your collagen by eating collagen you
[1388.18 - 1392.86] can't no you can't fix your kidney by
[1390.61 - 1396.79] eating a kidney you can't fix your eye
[1392.86 - 1398.38] by eating an eye you can't you can't fix
[1396.79 - 1400.42] your liver by eating a liver and you
[1398.38 - 1403.53] can't fix your skin by eating skin you
[1400.42 - 1408.16] can are you listening are you listening
[1403.53 - 1409.81] collagen that he swears to God about it
[1408.16 - 1411.52] like I feel like people generally
[1409.81 - 1413.26] attached themselves to the solutions
[1411.52 - 1415.81] that are not really solutions you need
[1413.26 - 1418.59] phytochemical compounds that are like
[1415.81 - 1422.68] for example in celery juice to create
[1418.59 - 1425.83] collagen collagen is created by our body
[1422.68 - 1427.90] it's created through fighting chemical
[1425.83 - 1428.94] compounds mineral salts and other things
[1427.90 - 1431.22] like that
[1428.94 - 1433.53] that's what creates collagen lots of
[1431.22 - 1436.02] antioxidants from like blueberries lots
[1433.53 - 1438.21] of man you can't eat something to create
[1436.02 - 1440.49] something that's that's actually that's
[1438.21 - 1444.60] a thousand years ago that was the Dark
[1440.49 - 1448.53] Ages with a C vitamin because we have to
[1444.60 - 1450.75] you know drink C vitamin or eight those
[1448.53 - 1453.42] are minerals and vitamins nutrients
[1450.75 - 1455.16] that's what we use to create things so
[1453.42 - 1458.07] we use vitamin C to create our immune
[1455.16 - 1460.26] system we use we use minerals to create
[1458.07 - 1462.99] tissue in cells we use all of this
[1460.26 - 1464.97] creates but you can't you can't take
[1462.99 - 1466.68] something like collagen that's actually
[1464.97 - 1469.32] in our skin but you can't take a
[1466.68 - 1470.58] collagen source another source of
[1469.32 - 1472.59] collagen whatever that might be
[1470.58 - 1474.45] consume it and think it's gonna go to
[1472.59 - 1475.98] the skin all it's going to do is go into
[1474.45 - 1477.36] your stomach and out your intestinal
[1475.98 - 1479.19] tract then you go to bathroom and it
[1477.36 - 1480.93] goes out and that's where it goes you
[1479.19 - 1482.85] can't find its way to your skin it's
[1480.93 - 1484.68] like it's like eating a sheep's eyeball
[1482.85 - 1487.17] to try to fix your eyeball or something
[1484.68 - 1489.51] it's like eating yes you know even
[1487.17 - 1491.37] kidneys it's people you can be kidney
[1489.51 - 1493.98] pie but that's what the kids were eating
[1491.37 - 1501.69] in my country we were growing up it was
[1493.98 - 1503.52] a liver and you know there's supplements
[1501.69 - 1504.84] out there with actual baby I don't know
[1503.52 - 1506.16] if they're still out there now I haven't
[1504.84 - 1507.66] been looking at these varieties of
[1506.16 - 1510.93] supplements but some of us out there
[1507.66 - 1513.90] would bringing in it with brain so in
[1510.93 - 1515.58] order to fix your brain and so you're
[1513.90 - 1517.14] gonna eat brain supplements to fix your
[1515.58 - 1519.96] brain it doesn't work like that see but
[1517.14 - 1522.93] for some reason we can we get tricked by
[1519.96 - 1524.73] propaganda by money by investments and
[1522.93 - 1526.23] those investments going to collagen it's
[1524.73 - 1527.07] such an easy sell like wait a minute my
[1526.23 - 1528.90] skin will get better
[1527.07 - 1531.00] collagen collagen let me tell you
[1528.90 - 1532.80] something when you have the worst eczema
[1531.00 - 1535.05] the worst eczema effort you can gobble
[1532.80 - 1536.82] all the collagen shakes you want and you
[1535.05 - 1538.71] can take all the collagen pills you want
[1536.82 - 1540.57] you can buy into it and spend thousands
[1538.71 - 1543.45] of dollars on collagen every other month
[1540.57 - 1546.60] and your skin will even not only stay
[1543.45 - 1548.88] the same you get so excited these things
[1546.60 - 1550.71] but you know we need people like you to
[1548.88 - 1552.60] speak to all of us because we've wanted
[1550.71 - 1554.04] to live a good life but it's just well
[1552.60 - 1555.93] you know what it is I'm not I'm not
[1554.04 - 1557.07] afraid of whose feelings I'm gonna hurt
[1555.93 - 1558.87] in the industries and that's what
[1557.07 - 1561.00] happens see everybody else there they
[1558.87 - 1561.87] got their afraid you know don't don't
[1561.00 - 1564.30] hurt that
[1561.87 - 1566.04] don't hurt that guy you know and really
[1564.30 - 1568.35] it you gotta protect the people who
[1566.04 - 1570.03] struggle and suffer you got it and you
[1568.35 - 1571.98] got and it doesn't matter if anybody's
[1570.03 - 1573.99] gonna you know water roast me like they
[1571.98 - 1576.62] do all the time and that's what happens
[1573.99 - 1579.15] we all know that I get I get hit more
[1576.62 - 1581.22] than anybody else in the industry
[1579.15 - 1584.22] because you can't make money off of
[1581.22 - 1586.77] celery juice so I'm a threat see this is
[1584.22 - 1588.18] actually healing people so it threatens
[1586.77 - 1590.07] the industries because they can't
[1588.18 - 1598.86] bankroll off of this this is the one
[1590.07 - 1601.62] this is this is rogue knowledge you're
[1598.86 - 1603.48] providing I'm sure sure so there's a lot
[1601.62 - 1605.64] of silence out there you can find in
[1603.48 - 1608.22] juice bars now the celery juice just not
[1605.64 - 1610.32] HPP one maybe just go for your fresh one
[1608.22 - 1611.88] but not a lot of money's made from that
[1610.32 - 1615.18] but the bigger industries like the
[1611.88 - 1616.98] college industry millions and millions
[1615.18 - 1619.14] of billions of dollars now it's a good
[1616.98 - 1621.00] trick it's a great trick because I'm
[1619.14 - 1622.86] using the good supplements you were
[1621.00 - 1626.55] recommending and I really think that's
[1622.86 - 1627.90] helpful yeah yeah it's important you
[1626.55 - 1629.85] want to be you want to ski you want to
[1627.90 - 1631.86] build skin tissue you want to get your
[1629.85 - 1633.48] skin nice and healthy you got to get the
[1631.86 - 1635.34] celery geez you got to get the metals
[1633.48 - 1637.68] out of your skin because that's what it
[1635.34 - 1639.36] is the metals on in our liver and get
[1637.68 - 1641.22] the toxins out of our liver and
[1639.36 - 1642.87] everything well with all this he
[1641.22 - 1644.43] provides out there you really don't have
[1642.87 - 1646.65] to think anymore what's to eat
[1644.43 - 1648.66] throughout the day cuz when you think
[1646.65 - 1650.88] about you know compiling everything say
[1648.66 - 1652.56] the the lemon water in the morning and
[1650.88 - 1654.74] the celery juice and then after dad who
[1652.56 - 1657.48] drinks some smoothies fruit smoothies
[1654.74 - 1659.85] and then go for the heavy metal detox I
[1657.48 - 1662.73] need some salad and the baked potatoes
[1659.85 - 1665.07] and also rice is okay right or I mean
[1662.73 - 1667.14] look rice rice isn't or pasta what do
[1665.07 - 1671.94] you think about pasta come on Italians
[1667.14 - 1674.04] we like well the lentil pot if you're
[1671.94 - 1675.72] gonna do a pasta the lentil pasta is the
[1674.04 - 1677.43] best one to do okay that's what my kids
[1675.72 - 1679.08] eat if you're gonna do a pasta if
[1677.43 - 1681.78] anybody out there wants to do pasta do
[1679.08 - 1683.85] the lentil pasta the red lentil pasta is
[1681.78 - 1687.33] even better yeah that's what I would do
[1683.85 - 1690.57] and the red lentils Percy that's also
[1687.33 - 1692.43] absolutely food that our bloating us
[1690.57 - 1694.32] come on that's a big thing out there
[1692.43 - 1697.08] everybody's complaining hoping there be
[1694.32 - 1699.36] bloated to everything when I get bloated
[1697.08 - 1700.85] when my skinny you know I look like I'm
[1699.36 - 1703.71] pregnant I'm not pregnant
[1700.85 - 1704.79] well it's the food I don't think you're
[1703.71 - 1707.88] really bloated
[1704.79 - 1710.07] when people are bloated they're like you
[1707.88 - 1712.83] know what no not in the morning I'm not
[1710.07 - 1715.02] after 32 ounces of celery honestly not
[1712.83 - 1716.37] gonna happen but um but you know what
[1715.02 - 1718.23] happens is the reason why people are
[1716.37 - 1719.67] bloating because their liver stagnant
[1718.23 - 1722.04] and sluggish that's what happens
[1719.67 - 1726.06] I think it's fatty liver you make the
[1722.04 - 1727.80] liver for everything everybody blames me
[1726.06 - 1729.99] for everything I gotta blame something
[1727.80 - 1731.16] else for everything okay because I'm
[1729.99 - 1732.51] always getting all the secrets that
[1731.16 - 1735.33] people don't know out there the truth
[1732.51 - 1737.25] out there and they're all like no no and
[1735.33 - 1739.47] you deliver is the guilty one in the
[1737.25 - 1740.46] terms of bloating deliver is the guilty
[1739.47 - 1742.41] one right there
[1740.46 - 1744.93] we haven't supported it enough yeah
[1742.41 - 1747.81] because we just we just let it get dense
[1744.93 - 1749.85] and sick and it gets congested with
[1747.81 - 1752.43] everything in there were no we're not
[1749.85 - 1754.86] cleansing it within the process how long
[1752.43 - 1756.36] does it take to clean because I've been
[1754.86 - 1759.15] plan based for the past five years
[1756.36 - 1762.54] thanks to my son thank you son because
[1759.15 - 1765.60] he inspired me you got to tell that
[1762.54 - 1769.53] story that's incredible yeah it's a good
[1765.60 - 1772.17] story well my son is my biggest
[1769.53 - 1774.27] inspiration in life and I mean my son
[1772.17 - 1777.11] and daughter but my daughter my son came
[1774.27 - 1779.73] first and he kind of started a cycle
[1777.11 - 1782.25] basically I was trying to be the
[1779.73 - 1784.08] healthiest I can be and knowing that
[1782.25 - 1786.48] there is a little human being inside of
[1784.08 - 1788.25] me I wanted to create this perfect
[1786.48 - 1789.96] environment for him when we live in this
[1788.25 - 1794.70] sick world we are bombed with all these
[1789.96 - 1796.71] you know well wrong messages of what's
[1794.70 - 1799.74] gonna make us happier and better and
[1796.71 - 1802.05] healthier and so when I started
[1799.74 - 1804.06] researching a lot on the what I can eat
[1802.05 - 1805.83] so that I can when I'm producing milk
[1804.06 - 1810.06] for my son he gets the best out of it
[1805.83 - 1812.04] and and I've turned plant-based or vegan
[1810.06 - 1814.35] well back then I was vegan and I was
[1812.04 - 1818.13] very very like hardcore
[1814.35 - 1820.56] on that and and that's what helped me
[1818.13 - 1823.80] understand and what did I like why would
[1820.56 - 1825.36] he what was the the idea about why did I
[1823.80 - 1826.91] start talking about this now I love my
[1825.36 - 1830.60] track well
[1826.91 - 1833.03] to the jackleg well yeah you just flew
[1830.60 - 1835.25] from another part of the world and
[1833.03 - 1835.94] you're on one hours sleep but I'm glad
[1835.25 - 1838.22] you're here
[1835.94 - 1839.54] but the yeah the thing is with with
[1838.22 - 1844.46] everything as you're telling story
[1839.54 - 1848.03] because you became the plant based and
[1844.46 - 1849.26] then the whole transition like how like
[1848.03 - 1851.95] you are feeling better you're always
[1849.26 - 1854.90] feeling better but when are you actually
[1851.95 - 1855.50] cleaned from all the stuff you ate for
[1854.90 - 1857.81] the past
[1855.50 - 1858.59] I don't know 28 years that was in the
[1857.81 - 1861.29] case in my life
[1858.59 - 1863.36] and then others who are healing yes like
[1861.29 - 1866.72] how long does it take his work when are
[1863.36 - 1868.82] we actually gonna feel the best like
[1866.72 - 1870.59] you've been doing that all your life the
[1868.82 - 1873.26] reason why you have so much energy and
[1870.59 - 1875.48] focus on this particular mission that is
[1873.26 - 1877.70] so noble and so important and please do
[1875.48 - 1879.62] recognize that because what we're doing
[1877.70 - 1881.42] right now requires lots of energy like
[1879.62 - 1883.10] I'm shaking from the excitement but he's
[1881.42 - 1885.41] been doing this every single day and
[1883.10 - 1886.91] writing books and sleeping two hours
[1885.41 - 1889.73] maybe in the night just to make sure
[1886.91 - 1892.07] that he refreshes and he is able to look
[1889.73 - 1894.53] like this thanks to all the wonderful
[1892.07 - 1896.81] knowledge who gets from you know the
[1894.53 - 1900.14] source and the wonderful spirit that I'm
[1896.81 - 1902.21] connected to too so yeah what you're
[1900.14 - 1904.34] doing is just something that has
[1902.21 - 1907.78] connected with me in so many levels and
[1904.34 - 1911.27] give me the cry right here so I guess I
[1907.78 - 1913.55] got a hold it back but that's the side
[1911.27 - 1915.71] of you people have to see because really
[1913.55 - 1918.23] the commitment you you give for this
[1915.71 - 1919.70] like I generally you know you get sick
[1918.23 - 1922.04] from people telling you they're sick oh
[1919.70 - 1924.05] I'm feeling her pain here and there and
[1922.04 - 1925.49] you know I'm every day waking up with
[1924.05 - 1928.19] this and then we all get sick from that
[1925.49 - 1931.04] and he gets to listen it and practically
[1928.19 - 1932.99] and with so much attention and gives the
[1931.04 - 1934.94] solution to people this is something
[1932.99 - 1936.80] that not you don't get in them you know
[1934.94 - 1939.17] doctor's office unfortunately you get a
[1936.80 - 1943.31] prescription which is just gonna delay
[1939.17 - 1945.53] another you know what walking delay
[1943.31 - 1947.36] yeah I could put sickness on hold a
[1945.53 - 1949.49] little bit but it gets routed deeper
[1947.36 - 1952.13] inside yeah but this is the information
[1949.49 - 1954.68] that actually gets you back on track and
[1952.13 - 1956.33] gives you the the time for you to to
[1954.68 - 1958.49] reset yourself and go back in the
[1956.33 - 1959.14] driving seat and that's how I feel in my
[1958.49 - 1961.57] life
[1959.14 - 1964.77] like you have control yeah and that's I
[1961.57 - 1968.19] mean I am addicted to control I'm a mom

[1968.19 - 1972.31] healthy and live in a healthy world and
[1970.69 - 1974.08] all of a sudden there are these soldiers

[2000.12 - 2004.14] tales I speak to my kids now there is a
[2001.98 - 2007.08] whole fairy tale about kids you know
[2004.14 - 2009.30] about the deliver deliver and all the
[2007.08 - 2011.70] like toxins and stuff trying to get in
[2009.30 - 2013.56] it's like you know no no and my kids are
[2011.70 - 2015.69] liking those stories I mean I do make
[2013.56 - 2019.86] them funny but some kids do cry from
[2015.69 - 2021.66] those stories so it's it's it's it's an
[2019.86 - 2023.61] interesting journey I love the idea of
[2021.66 - 2025.38] teaching my kids from early on and not
[2023.61 - 2027.15] only my kids but all the kids that we
[2025.38 - 2028.92] touch through the foundation how they
[2027.15 - 2030.80] can take care of themselves you know how
[2028.92 - 2033.06] they can start this life and live it
[2030.80 - 2034.64] despite everything that is around us
[2033.06 - 2037.08] because that's not what makes us
[2034.64 - 2038.88] unhealthy it's our choices that we make
[2037.08 - 2041.16] we have a choice every single day to
[2038.88 - 2042.93] choose the right thing to do for us in
[2041.16 - 2045.27] the planet and that's what you've
[2042.93 - 2046.92] provided us like I haven't found this
[2045.27 - 2049.26] knowledge in many books and I've read a
[2046.92 - 2051.12] lot of books on health this is these are
[2049.26 - 2052.80] the books I come back to and I will
[2051.12 - 2054.30] forever be grateful for what you're
[2052.80 - 2057.60] doing I'm honored you know the
[2054.30 - 2060.21] information in the books is it's not out
[2057.60 - 2062.19] there it only comes from this source so
[2060.21 - 2064.41] it's not like it's repackaged it's funny
[2062.19 - 2066.51] because the health books of today and
[2064.41 - 2069.12] I'm not trying to say that they're not
[2066.51 - 2071.55] helpful it's just that it's the same
[2069.12 - 2073.74] stuff but it's repackaged for the next
[2071.55 - 2075.27] generation of basically people who start
[2073.74 - 2077.19] getting health minded when whether
[2075.27 - 2078.75] they're in their 20s or whether they're
[2077.19 - 2080.19] in their 30s or when they're just
[2078.75 - 2082.23] starting to get health mind it and
[2080.19 - 2083.79] they're getting excited and they get
[2082.23 - 2084.90] they get the books out there and they
[2083.79 - 2086.61] get the information out there and they
[2084.90 - 2088.11] read articles and they don't know that
[2086.61 - 2090.90] that information was the same
[2088.11 - 2092.85] information that was repackaged ten
[2090.90 - 2094.41] go to the crowd before them and then 10
[2092.85 - 2096.24] years ago to the crowd before them like
[2094.41 - 2098.64] for instance he got the whole candida
[2096.24 - 2100.50] thing that happened for 30-40 years now
[2098.64 - 2103.20] they switched it to microbiome but it's
[2100.50 - 2105.66] still the same package but they renamed
[2103.20 - 2107.31] it and then then the newer generation
[2105.66 - 2109.08] kind of comes up and they don't realize
[2107.31 - 2111.09] that the answers aren't in there yet and
[2109.08 - 2113.13] if they get too sick they'll find that
[2111.09 - 2115.44] the answers aren't really there and
[2113.13 - 2117.90] that's what happens it's like so you
[2115.44 - 2120.33] know it's it's it depends on how sick a
[2117.90 - 2122.58] person gets to realize and I noticed
[2120.33 - 2124.59] that the older people who've been there
[2122.58 - 2126.78] done that they've seen all the tricks
[2124.59 - 2128.55] and games they've seen the decades of
[2126.78 - 2130.80] tricks and games and they realize things
[2128.55 - 2132.48] are repackaged so when they find this
[2130.80 - 2133.98] information and we wait a minute this
[2132.48 - 2136.16] was different than anything else that
[2133.98 - 2139.44] exists out there the rest is repackaged
[2136.16 - 2141.18] backed by money put out there and it's
[2139.44 - 2149.49] still it's not getting people to that
[2141.18 - 2151.95] next level of where they need to go and
[2149.49 - 2154.44] everybody swear to it and there was this
[2151.95 - 2156.93] just recent article I feel like it was a
[2154.44 - 2159.42] maybe half an year half a year ago where
[2156.93 - 2166.11] they published the information about the
[2159.42 - 2169.26] coconut oil being toxic carcinogenic and
[2166.11 - 2171.66] so you know you are you're everybody's
[2169.26 - 2174.87] drinking coconut water coconut oil you
[2171.66 - 2178.23] know putting on their face or or their
[2174.87 - 2179.76] food and frying stuff with it and now
[2178.23 - 2181.80] all of a sudden that's wrong and then
[2179.76 - 2191.43] you're like where should I go to for all
[2181.80 - 2193.56] the information and how do I you know I
[2191.43 - 2197.55] remember texting you many times asking
[2193.56 - 2199.62] you how much fat is too much fat like
[2197.55 - 2202.38] and can we actually live without the
[2199.62 - 2205.44] fact because it's in avocado for
[2202.38 - 2208.80] instance everybody's been dying with the
[2205.44 - 2211.11] fat mm-hmm we just decade after decade
[2208.80 - 2215.31] after decade everybody's dying with the
[2211.11 - 2216.75] fat so everybody is on fat just
[2215.31 - 2219.48] everybody's on it doesn't matter you
[2216.75 - 2221.64] know Megan's I'm not but you know what
[2219.48 - 2222.45] but it's still good to have a little you
[2221.64 - 2225.01] can have
[2222.45 - 2226.63] I'm going your way a little bit of that
[2225.01 - 2227.83] Mikado you can have some coconut oil if
[2226.63 - 2229.27] you're into fish you can have some sort
[2227.83 - 2231.88] of age you can have some really good
[2229.27 - 2233.41] high quality fats if you're into animal
[2231.88 - 2235.39] products you go for the highest quality
[2233.41 - 2237.70] but if you go for bacon or pork you're
[2235.39 - 2239.50] into the bad fat now but let me tell you
[2237.70 - 2241.69] the bad I'm a very strong advocate for
[2239.50 - 2244.63] clan-based so I wouldn't you know you're
[2241.69 - 2246.70] all plant-based your plan I'm not I mean
[2244.63 - 2248.50] you're so kind to speak about it in such
[2246.70 - 2251.41] way this is you do know that people are
[2248.50 - 2254.62] enjoying meat I love my meat you're hard
[2251.41 - 2256.45] at work plant it was like because you
[2254.62 - 2258.19] know there is not many I respect that
[2256.45 - 2261.07] though because I've seen plant-based
[2258.19 - 2263.16] diets literally take people out of the
[2261.07 - 2266.86] depths of hell with their health
[2263.16 - 2268.74] literally worse and pull them out of it
[2266.86 - 2271.36] I've seen it pull them out of it
[2268.74 - 2273.73] absolutely but the right people are like
[2271.36 - 2275.62] saying okay now I'm feeling better so
[2273.73 - 2278.23] I'm just gonna go back to what it was
[2275.62 - 2280.51] before right so the plan based diet is
[2278.23 - 2282.85] mainly to get you out of the you know
[2280.51 - 2284.59] hole and then you go back to your meat
[2282.85 - 2286.66] until you go back again in the hole and
[2284.59 - 2289.48] then you go back to that so there's a
[2286.66 - 2292.09] some maintenance diet yeah but it is a
[2289.48 - 2293.56] maintenance diet he should be it is no
[2292.09 - 2296.02] you can be plant-based anybody out there
[2293.56 - 2297.19] plant-based I mean raise your hand
[2296.02 - 2299.83] yep raise your hand if you're planning
[2297.19 - 2301.81] to that yeah it's a powerful way to heal
[2299.83 - 2303.64] stick to it you know if you're something
[2301.81 - 2305.68] that you don't want to do plant based on
[2303.64 - 2307.42] some other kicking everything lower your
[2305.68 - 2308.98] fats but I tell people plant-based down
[2307.42 - 2310.63] lower your fats you know that's the
[2308.98 - 2313.15] thing is is I'm all about whatever
[2310.63 - 2314.71] wherever you are with your diet you got
[2313.15 - 2315.94] to bring your fats down because that's
[2314.71 - 2317.74] where you'll get in trouble every time
[2315.94 - 2320.44] maybe you're not gonna get your curves
[2317.74 - 2327.40] you know because those magazines and
[2320.44 - 2330.13] popular places are actually it's like we
[2327.40 - 2331.87] could offer Kings really both of us we
[2330.13 - 2336.40] have two chairs moving probably sit in
[2331.87 - 2337.87] one and we do feel good I mean this is
[2336.40 - 2339.64] like this is what we're talking about
[2337.87 - 2341.95] actually feeling good rather than
[2339.64 - 2343.33] looking good and I know there are so
[2341.95 - 2345.46] many people out there who want to feel
[2343.33 - 2347.62] good and there are ways and it's just
[2345.46 - 2349.45] well no I I could go into the gym I
[2347.62 - 2351.73] could go into gym three hours a day
[2349.45 - 2352.58] we're doing some muscle maybe I should
[2351.73 - 2354.05] go in the gym do
[2352.58 - 2355.37] three hours they start building muscle
[2354.05 - 2357.53] maybe I'll go and get some massages
[2355.37 - 2359.06] everyday maybe I'll go and do yoga for
[2357.53 - 2360.41] two hours day and I won't be able to
[2359.06 - 2363.23] help anybody because I'll be too busy
[2360.41 - 2365.15] taking care of myself but in doing all
[2363.23 - 2368.90] that so forget right in the books the
[2365.15 - 2370.73] writing the book sleeps two hours a day
[2368.90 - 2374.09] so he can provide all the knowledge to
[2370.73 - 2376.01] us so sorry I've had people I've had
[2374.09 - 2377.66] people say hey look medical medium I
[2376.01 - 2379.82] thought you'd be built I thought you
[2377.66 - 2381.05] would have big guns ripped I thought
[2379.82 - 2382.55] you'd be ripped and it'd be like you
[2381.05 - 2384.11] want me to go that route you want me to
[2382.55 - 2386.27] dedicate half my life into getting
[2384.11 - 2388.70] ripped I can then I'll put off all the
[2386.27 - 2391.19] work forget finishing these books forget
[2388.70 - 2394.43] doing what I gotta do as a mother - I
[2391.19 - 2396.44] can totally understand when you say you

[2398.09 - 2402.08] struggling to find your yeah time yeah

[2402.08 - 2407.00] it's really difficult for everybody and
[2403.79 - 2408.29] then but there's people that they make
[2407.00 - 2409.91] it their life you know you can see
[2408.29 - 2411.35] people who are built it's cuz they made

[2430.43 - 2436.40] no it's true they say I'm 28 because I
[2433.37 - 2438.14] look so old when you're 28 I think it's
[2436.40 - 2440.18] done I think it's out there on the
[2438.14 - 2442.46] Internet I remember that I asked you
[2440.18 - 2445.04] that like how do you stay so young and
[2442.46 - 2446.60] and then it's like what what is it was
[2445.04 - 2447.77] just so confusing obviously there are
[2446.60 - 2448.91] lots of lies out there and there are
[2447.77 - 2451.18] people who are trying to discredit
[2448.91 - 2454.37] people doing good stuff and and I feel
[2451.18 - 2456.32] for me the most thing the thing that
[2454.37 - 2458.72] connects me is this soul feeling like
[2456.32 - 2460.70] this inside of me feeling I don't
[2458.72 - 2463.34] connect too many things out there like
[2460.70 - 2465.02] that but I did to you and through your
[2463.34 - 2469.25] books because you're a spoken word I

[2575.86 - 2579.01] neurologists they got all the different
[2577.63 - 2581.95] symptoms and everything and they're just
[2579.01 - 2583.96] struggling in any every way and and the

[2583.96 - 2587.86] diagnoses the skins you know having
[2585.97 - 2589.48] problems or they get the fatigue that
[2587.86 - 2591.01] neurological fatigue that I talk about
[2589.48 - 2592.72] in all the books and everything works
[2591.01 - 2594.88] your nervous system is so weak that
[2592.72 - 2597.43] you're just you can't function you're
[2594.88 - 2599.98] lazy like bags of cement you know and

[2613.48 - 2618.72] know have like you know all of the stuff
[2616.42 - 2620.31] we've been told from the early
[2618.72 - 2621.96] you know years on because our parents
[2620.31 - 2624.24] didn't know either and our grandparents
[2621.96 - 2626.55] didn't know none of us knew what we were
[2624.24 - 2628.08] doing and now when you come here and
[2626.55 - 2629.67] you're like yeah let's change this and

[2634.44 - 2639.27] this you know but stay strong that's why
[2637.62 - 2641.52] the communities are important that's why
[2639.27 - 2643.56] this in particular is so important you
