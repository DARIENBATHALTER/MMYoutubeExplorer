71
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,280
and nobody understands unless they've

72
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,319
gone through it

73
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,060
nobody gets it unless they've gone

74
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,739
through it right

75
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,720

don't really get it did you ever notice

83
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,019
that something that you're going through

84
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,700
something that's happening in your life

85
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:00,780
and they don't get it somebody doesn't

86
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:03,300
get it

87
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:05,280
because they haven't experienced it

88
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:07,200
themselves you see that's a big deal

89
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,739
right there a lot of people work on

90
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,340
referencing

91
00:03:09,739 --> 00:03:13,680
referencing

92
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:16,019
you can see somebody run out of a built

93
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,120
burning building right they run onto

94
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:19,620
they run out of burning building and

95
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,780
they run across the street they get hit

96
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:23,280
by a truck at the same time

97
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:26,220
and

98
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,780
it'd be like hey hey whoa whoa that guy

99
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:29,700
ran a burning building whoa he just got

100
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:32,400
run over

101
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:34,019
but yet you talk to the guy later on in

102
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,340
the hospital and you're like hey you

103
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:37,560

104
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:39,900
it that was them I can't even tell you

105
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,879
and you can't really you can't reference

106
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:44,480
it unless it happened to you A lot of

107
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:44,480
people do that

108
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,060
they just don't know what you're going

109
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:50,459
through with all your chronic illness

110
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:53,760

you struggle with they don't know

115
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,700
what it's like unless they've

116
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:07,920
experienced it themselves and even then

117
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:09,420

118
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,159

Brain saver books making a recipe out of

there if you just got on here that's the

145
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,720
infamous protocols book that's saving

146
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,919
people's lives around the world right

147
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,139
now

148
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:30,060
people are digging the protocols book

149
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:31,199
you've got to check it out if you don't

150
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:33,360
have it

151
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,919
anyway there it is the recipe we're

152
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,320
making right there Asian inspired potato

153
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:38,880
Skillet

154
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:41,460
I can't get enough of potato dishes

155
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,199
potato Skillets anything potato you

156
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:45,479
can't get enough of it

157
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,100
they just come out so darn good now I

158
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:49,080
got all kinds of killer stuff right here

159
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:51,840
so I got the potatoes but they're

160
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:53,759
steamed they're steamed you don't have

161
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:57,120
to use a steamed potato you can just you

162
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:58,800
can slice it you know hard and crunchy

163
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,419
potato when you throw it in the pan or

164
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,639
I'll already hear the heat kicking in

165
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:04,500
right there I hear the onions starting

166
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,860
to sizzle

167
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,860
remember

168
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:12,840
right facing out the blade facing out if

169
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:14,759
you're ever going to do the garlic trick

170
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:16,320
I've watched a lot of people screw up

171
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:18,600
I've watched people that have gone to

172
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:21,539
all kinds of Chef schools and everything

173
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:23,880
and they do it this way right there they

174
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:26,039
do it with the blade facing towards them

175
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,840
you don't want to do that you don't want

176
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:29,759
to do the garlic crushing trick like you

177
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:33,900
see this right here because the knife

178
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:36,479
flips up real easy and I've seen a dude

179
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:38,400
go like that

180
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:41,039
you know what I mean like that and like

181
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,660
that you don't want to ever do that you

182
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:44,639
want to flip it that way it says it's

183
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:48,139
not going to flip up as easy going that

184
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,139
way so when you do the garlic trip

185
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,380
you don't want to do it that way see one

186
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,060
thing

187
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:58,680
see what I'm saying

are you kidding this is insane

299
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,040
the amount of information in there is

300
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:12,500
just

301
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,700
it's just

302
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:16,860
beyond beyond

303
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:20,220
all right so we got some different stuff

304
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:22,140
here let's see what's next what's next

305
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:24,420
we'll put something else in here just

306
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:27,540
reading comments as we go along too

307
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:29,820
how are you cooking without olive oil

308
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:32,220
yeah you don't need to cook with olive

309
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:35,220
oil you just don't

310
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:36,839
you don't have to drown it in oil

311
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:39,860
olive oil

312
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,860
that's a great oil

313
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,640
it's not a bad oil at all

314
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:49,800
but you don't need to it's a ceramic pan

315
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:52,560
ceramic pan but you don't need to drown

316
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:53,880
everything in oil guys I'm going to read

317
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,639
out of one of the books in a little bit

318
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:58,639
and just getting this going I'm going to

319
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:02,480
read a little bit about adrenaline

320
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:02,480
adrenalized emotions

321
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:08,220
now the potatoes are steamed so you

322
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:09,660
don't have to add them in quite yet you

323
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:11,160
could wait a little bit cook down some

324
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:15,019
of the other stuff

325
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:15,019
so maybe we can go with uh

326
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:21,980
to put a little bit of these false

327
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:21,980
flakes in here got some dull slicks

328
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:29,700
nice

329
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:32,160
I love I love dogs love it Atlantic

330
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:35,660
way to go

331
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,660
I'm gonna put in a cup of water

332
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:39,180
you can do healing broth because that's

333
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,839
actually what it calls for it calls for

334
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:44,519
healing broth alternative is water

335
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:47,100
that's the alternative so I popped that

336
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:48,959
in here it's great I'm going to crank up

337
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:51,959
the heat just a little bit

338
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:54,060
I'm gonna get this nice and going all

339
00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:55,980
right let's start chopping up some other

340
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:56,940
stuff maybe we'll go with

341
00:13:55,980 --> 00:14:00,120
um

342
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:02,040
some of these sugar snaps you guys love

343
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:06,800
sugar snaps

344
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:06,800
it's one of my favorite sugar snaps God

345
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,940
they're insane

346
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:18,500
so good good thinly slice them

347
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,500
you can do it this way

348
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:21,500
you can put them in whole if you really

349
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:26,600
like

350
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:26,600
right get some of these in here

351
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:37,200
a lot of people react differently to a

352
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:39,959
situation that's happening in their life

353
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:41,639
some people their adrenaline isn't

354
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:43,380
really happening in the moment as

355
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:44,459
something is happening meaning something

356
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:47,040
like

357
00:14:44,459 --> 00:14:49,440
challenging in the moment right and then

358
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:52,320
some people would hit some later

359
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,300
right before they go to bed

360
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,940
and their mind is racing

361
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:59,519
they're they feel like their heart is

362
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:02,699
racing right

363
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:05,480
I always check my heart beat right here

364
00:15:02,699 --> 00:15:05,480
that's what I always do

365
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:16,740
foreign

366
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,899
kind of gets you connected to the inner

367
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,639
workings

368
00:15:23,899 --> 00:15:29,720
even when nothing is going on right no

369
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:32,519
adrenaline at all is happening

370
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:35,120
let's get some more of these sugar snaps

371
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:35,120
in really quick

372
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:44,699
I think I'm gonna put a few more in here

373
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:46,440
this is cooking up nice

374
00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:48,420
this dish is actually going to be done

375
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:50,639
pretty soon this isn't going to take so

376
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:53,660
long how easy does it get

377
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:53,660
think about it

378
00:15:54,139 --> 00:16:00,560
you get company and you're like worked

379
00:15:56,579 --> 00:16:00,560
on it all day long all day

380
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:05,519
really

381
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:11,420
you don't need to

382
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,420
I might put in

383
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:16,760
actually oh that's looking good

384
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:22,620
let's see the mushrooms in here you'll

385
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:24,320
see the sugar snap peas checked it out

386
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:27,779
you guys you see the onions in here

387
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:31,019
onions are from my garden you all see

388
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:33,180
some hot pepper I threw in here too

389
00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:35,339
it's a recipe you can use uncooked

390
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:37,019
potatoes remember that you don't have to

391
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:38,880
use steamed potatoes I'm using steamed

392
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:41,100
potatoes in this one just letting you

393
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:43,860
guys know giving you the heads up on

394
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:46,380
that you don't have to use

395
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:49,500
a steamed potato you can use a raw

396
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:50,880
potato right uncooked potatoes nothing

397
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:53,180
wrong with that I'm gonna pop a couple

398
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:55,860
more of these in here

399
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:57,540
you can just chop a four at a time just

400
00:16:55,860 --> 00:17:00,680
like this

401
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:00,680
Swatch your fingers

402
00:17:02,699 --> 00:17:07,220
it's coming together

403
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,220
go with a few more

404
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:13,040
come together right now

405
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:22,880
little beetles going on

406
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:27,360
all right

407
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:30,840
I might read pretty soon

408
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:32,280
let's just see what else there is to do

409
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:34,140
thank you

410
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:36,780
I turned up the heat a little bit more

411
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:38,760
this thing's gonna crank

412
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:40,320
did I put ginger in this yet I think

413
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:42,360
that's at the end

414
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:45,660
for the sauce

415
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:47,100
we'll do some lime and ginger sauce at

416
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:50,960
the end a little maple syrup the whole

417
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:50,960
bit I think potatoes are next

418
00:17:53,700 --> 00:18:00,780
just want to get that water kind of out

419
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:03,960
mushrooms will actually make a lot more

420
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:06,660
moisture in your pan in your plate in

421
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:11,900
your you know your pots and all that

422
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:11,900
so mushrooms will do it it's normal

423
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:16,020
and simmer with the lid on I'm not going

424
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:19,080
to simmer with the lid on in this one

425
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:19,880
I'm just going to let it do its thing

426
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:22,260
um

427
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:25,580
but we're just about there let me let me

428
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:25,580
slice up some potatoes here

429
00:18:27,419 --> 00:18:31,559
usually I do

430
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:33,660
so I'm slicing these up

431
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:35,580
just like this

432
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:39,440
okay I'm gonna make these nice slices

433
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:39,440
once again this is a steamed potato

434
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:45,059
I don't want it to crumble I want these

435
00:18:42,419 --> 00:18:47,640
like to be just like this if I make them

436
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:50,179
too thin they're gonna fall apart

437
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,179
okay

438
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:56,220
there we go

439
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:58,320
I'm gonna keep this little end in there

440
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:59,940
actually I'll take a little lens move

441
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,100
the little ends out

442
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:04,700
let me just get these ready why that's

443
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,700
cooking along

444
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:17,760
taking these little here we go

445
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:21,059
this is a russet I really like russets

446
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:24,299
the potato police are always on my ass

447
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:26,400
Nightshade Nightshade medical medium

448
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:30,500
stupid he doesn't know anything about

449
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,500
health it's a nightshade

450
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,500
foreign

451
00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:43,200
and then fear and Chaos ensues right

452
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:49,020
you'll hear people they'll say I can't

453
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:51,000
eat a potato my whole body just flares

454
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:53,880
up overnight

455
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:59,160
you sure it wasn't all the bad oil and

456
00:19:53,880 --> 00:20:01,679
cheese and sour cream and whatever

457
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:03,240
or you sure it wasn't the potato chips

458
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:06,559
you ate

459
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:06,559

460
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:16,400
come on now fly on the wall

461
00:20:12,539 --> 00:20:16,400
if I can only be a fly on the wall

462
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:22,640
that can only be a fly on the wall

463
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:29,880
so many things you'll see

464
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:31,860
that people just aren't aware of but so

465
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:33,000
many things you'll see when you're a fly

466
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:37,280
on the wall

467
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,280
you'll see a lot of crap going down

468
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:43,140
be like what is that person doing oh my

469
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:45,360
God what

470
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:48,419
no wonder

471
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:51,539
what happened was

472
00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:53,220
they had a baked potato at the fast food

473
00:20:51,539 --> 00:20:56,419
restaurant

474
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:56,419
sour cream

475
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:04,100
and dangerous chemicals laced all over

476
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:04,100
it

477
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:13,500
and some crazy canola oil worse

478
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:15,780
something else even worse and that's bad

479
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:18,740
all right so we're cutting these in nice

480
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:18,740
slices right here

481
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:24,299
I'm still gonna eat these ends because I

482
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:27,480
know that the food police might be out

483
00:21:24,299 --> 00:21:29,940
there and I I know I'm gonna get shamed

484
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:33,659
see these little guys right here right

485
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:36,380
but believe me um

486
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:36,380
those are great

487
00:21:39,059 --> 00:21:43,280
hmm

488
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:43,280
that's so good

489
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:48,600
so

490
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:50,220
this actually helps to stabilize

491
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:52,799
adrenals believe it or not this dish

492
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:54,980

I had to make myself some dinner anyway

512
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:07,820
I figured hey look let's do it together

513
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:15,120
I'm going to be careful with these a

514
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:17,580

515
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:20,059

569
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:01,260
sharonelle says which book is the recipe

570
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:05,700

protocols insane book an insane book

572
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:10,740

00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:13,140
my way-hearted about it and stuff right

574
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:15,659
I pretend it's no big deal

575
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:17,279
but what's in this book is just

576
00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:19,559
it's unmatched

577
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:21,840
seriously these are the greatest books

578
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:25,260
in all health history

579
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:27,419
mark my words you read them you'll know

580
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:29,159
what they offer is more than just

581
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:32,360
recipes but the recipes are insanely

582
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:32,360
incredible all on its own

583
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,940
foreign

584
00:26:53,820 --> 00:27:00,480
gone all right

585
00:26:56,460 --> 00:27:02,100
let's whisk up some type of sauce

586
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:05,960
two tablespoons

587
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:05,960
of fresh lime juice

588
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:13,340
I hear some Canadian geese in the

589
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:13,340
background

590
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:18,299
powerful meditation right there

591
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:19,980
hearing the geese fly over

592
00:27:18,299 --> 00:27:22,260
from when it starts

593
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:25,279
as they're traveling closer

594
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:25,279
and they're getting closer

595
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:30,299
the geese right it's not a great

596
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:32,039
imitation of some geese I'll have to

597
00:27:30,299 --> 00:27:34,740
practice and I will later on believe it

598
00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:36,659
believe me I actually will and the geese

599
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:37,860
are flying closer closer and then

600
00:27:36,659 --> 00:27:39,900
they're leaving and you've got to tune

601
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:41,340
in you have to tune in as the geese are

602
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:43,500
leaving right

603
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:45,059
and even if you don't catch them with

604
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:46,559
your eyes

605
00:27:45,059 --> 00:27:49,980
you just

606
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:51,900
listen until they go out of range

607
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:54,539
completely

608
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:57,380
talking about rewiring the brand that's

609
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:57,380
a great one right there

610
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:02,520
nobody knows that one

611
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,020
but that's what happens on these lives

612
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:06,500
stuff will come from Spirit of

613
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:06,500
compassion

614
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:13,080

00:35:58,859 --> 00:36:02,400
there's a lemon on here that was only in

right

776
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:19,260
when the potatoes are almost ready

777
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:21,119
because you're using raw potatoes I'm

778
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:22,500
using a steamed potato they're ready

779
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:24,119
anyway

780
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:26,720
when the potatoes are almost ready stir

781
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:26,720
in the sauce

782
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:34,260
cook for three to two to three minutes

783
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:37,339
if you can

784
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:37,339
I'm gonna stir in the sauce

785
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:50,339
it's actually really exciting because

786
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:53,820
I'm hungry

787
00:36:50,339 --> 00:36:58,800

788
00:36:53,820 --> 00:37:01,619

789
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:03,359

791
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:06,920
is in there okay

792
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,140
there's a potato Skillet right there

793
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:11,640
Asian Potato Skillet now I'm gonna be

794
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:13,320
reading a little bit of brain saver

795
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:16,220
adrenaline

796
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:18,839
emotions

797
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:22,220
let it cook for a couple of minutes

798
00:37:18,839 --> 00:37:22,220
pan still playing hot

799
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:28,980
there's no vinegar

800
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:30,839
fancy that no vinegar

801
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:33,060
vinegar

802
00:37:30,839 --> 00:37:35,480
on every vinegar label whether it's

803
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:38,220
apple cider vinegar or not it should say

804
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:40,920
if you're concerned about losing your

805
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:44,099
teeth down the road

806
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:45,900
do not consume this product that's it

807
00:37:44,099 --> 00:37:47,040
all vinegars apple cider vinegar

808
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:48,320
included even though that's the best

809
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,760
vinegar

810
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:54,140
all right

811
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:54,140
there's no vinegar in here

812
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:59,280
I think people don't realize they get

813
00:37:56,099 --> 00:38:01,560
vinegar to death in their cooking

814
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:03,720
eating out and everything else what you

815
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:06,240
do is you chop up a little cilantro

816
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:08,160
I'm going to serve this this is coming

817
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:10,500
out great

818
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:13,079
there we go

819
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:16,820
let it cook for another minute

820
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:16,820
you might be able to find a plate

821
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:22,579
small plate I have a large plate

822
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:37,920
this is actually simmering up nice

823
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:40,680
but let's do this

824
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:43,079
let's do this

825
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:45,480
chop up some cilantro when we serve it

826
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:47,400
we'll just chop it up now though we'll

827
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:49,920
have it ready

828
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:52,820
put the cilantro out of my garden right

829
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,820
here okay

830
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:58,500
here we go

831
00:38:56,099 --> 00:39:00,119
now here's what this is cilantro that

832
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:02,940
has been growing for quite a long time

833
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:04,859
you know how it changes

834
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:08,400
you guys know what happens to Cilantro

835
00:39:04,859 --> 00:39:12,480
when it bypasses that certain moment in

836
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:13,859
time and then a few weeks later it turns

837
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,780
kind of frizzy

838
00:39:13,859 --> 00:39:18,359
and then you get

839
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:20,700
coriander kind of seed going on that

840
00:39:18,359 --> 00:39:24,420
whole vibe right

841
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:26,880
so this is but I love cilantro even at

842
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:31,140
this stage seriously chop a little bit

843
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:33,540
of cilantro that will go on after

844
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:36,800
and chop up a little bit of

845
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:36,800
pepper as well

846
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:42,079
hopefully my jokes are pleasing

847
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:49,800
this is a very hot pepper what I'm gonna

848
00:39:47,099 --> 00:39:53,220
do is stay away from those seeds just in

849
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:54,720
case others want to enjoy

850
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:57,740
so what I'm going to do is cut this

851
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,740
pepper another one

852
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:03,020
yes I hope my sense of humor is pleasing

853
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,020
to the ears

854
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:08,540
so I am at your disposal and At Your

want to go too crazy you don't want to

858
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:16,680
shred it you kind of want it to stick

859
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:18,300
around you want people to be able to

860
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:19,740
avoid it if they want if you've got a

861
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:22,740
really hot pepper like that you want

862
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:24,780
them to be able to actually avoid it and

863
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:27,300
be like can I just move this hot pepper

864
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:30,140
out a little bit

865
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:30,140
foreign

866
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:36,240

867
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:38,760
you got it on your hands you so well

868
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:41,640
that was aftershave right

869
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:44,119
smack it on your face and then you start

870
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:44,119
screaming

871
00:40:44,339 --> 00:40:48,000
thing is with hot pepper it's it's legit

872
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:50,660
I can't tell you over the years how many

873
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,660
people were like

874
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:56,520
like

875
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:59,280
in trouble from it for so many various

876
00:40:56,520 --> 00:41:01,200
reasons all right I'm gonna plate this

877
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:03,780
and then I'm gonna pop on some of the

878
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:08,119

what are you making

882
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:23,540
Rose

883
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:28,800
I am making this recipe right here Asian

884
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:30,359
inspired potato Skillet I'm about to

885
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,500
Plate it then I'm gonna read out of one

886
00:41:30,359 --> 00:41:33,660
of the brain saver books about

887
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:37,460
adrenaline and emotions

888
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:37,460
it's an incredible recipe

889
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:42,060
okay

890
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:47,839
how can I do this appropriately

891
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:54,180
now if you're familiar with medical

892
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:56,460
media medical medium uh cooking show

893
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:58,440
medical medium recipes you'll notice

894
00:41:56,460 --> 00:42:01,020
that I do mess up a lot in different

895
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:02,880
areas there's always some crazy spillage

896
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:04,380
something hits the floor but it looks

897
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:06,480
like we're actually in a better place

898
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:08,400
I'm gonna shut that off looks like we're

899
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:12,440
in a better place right now with that

900
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:12,440
meaning like it's not happening or

901
00:42:16,859 --> 00:42:23,839
but I would like to Plate it nicely

902
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:23,839
something that would be really

903
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:30,200
I was going to try to make it look good

904
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:30,200
you guys want to come over

905
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:36,240
you guys want to come over and and uh

906
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,740
I'm gonna do you ever see this in

907
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:40,579
cooking shows right everybody always

908
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:40,579
takes this and they're like

909
00:42:41,099 --> 00:42:46,200
pork is in there right pork tenderloins

910
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:48,780
and everything else and they put some

911
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:52,020
kind of weird syrup syrupy like sauce

912
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:55,099
down on there right

913
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:55,099
and they clean it off

914
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,880
nice

915
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:05,640
let's garnish it

916
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:10,560
but let me just take a look

917
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:12,599
okay so my bad my bad

918
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:14,819
you'll see the garnishing here are

919
00:43:12,599 --> 00:43:17,160
larger pieces of cilantro I had kind of

920
00:43:14,819 --> 00:43:19,200
the frizzier parts and I chopped the

921
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:20,460
 out of it is what I did on The

922
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:22,079
Cutting Board

923
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:26,300
the peppers though look good I think

924
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:26,300
that's gonna work so let's pop that on

925
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:32,420
I'm gonna pop a little bit of this fresh

926
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:32,420
cilantro right here

927
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,800
I gotta tell you I'm actually really

928
00:43:36,119 --> 00:43:40,200
psyched to eat this

929
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:42,300
really really excited

930
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:44,160
look a little bit of cilantro on there

931
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:46,740
and then I'm gonna pop some of these hot

932
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:49,020
fresh hot peppers on here too

933
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:52,460

00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:28,380

1034
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:30,060
The Refuge recipe on is it page 402 I

1035
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:32,839
saw that right there page 402 of

1036
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:32,839
protocols

1037
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:40,160
hello

1038
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:45,079
Adrenalize emotions

1039
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:51,119
adrenaline heightens everything going on

1040
00:48:48,119 --> 00:48:55,500
in the brain electrically

1041
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:57,839
because adrenaline is explosive in the

1042
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:59,880
brain when it heads to the brain and it

1043
00:48:57,839 --> 00:49:02,819
hits those neurons those electrical

1044
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:04,500
impulses it's explosive that's why

1045
00:49:02,819 --> 00:49:05,760
there's so many Adrenaline Junkies and

1046
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:07,140
that's why there's so many people just

1047
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:08,640
hooked on adrenaline that's why there's

1048
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:11,220
people doing all kinds of crazy stuff

1049
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:13,260
because of adrenaline right

1050
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:14,819
when we get emotionally challenged on

1051
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:16,980
any level and that could be anything

1052
00:49:14,819 --> 00:49:18,780
that could be anything

1053
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:22,079
seriously when we get emotionally

1054
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:25,140
challenged with anything

1055
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:27,780
whether good or bad did I say good

1056
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:30,240
even good stuff seriously

1057
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:31,500
whether in a brand new relationship with

1058
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:33,480
a partner

1059
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:35,280

it's a good adrenaline

1067
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:51,900
but still it can be tough right you need

1068
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:54,300
to rest in between

1069
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:55,619
you need to rest in between and do good

1070
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:57,660
things for yourself

1071
00:49:55,619 --> 00:50:00,660
whether it's a brand new relationship

1072
00:49:57,660 --> 00:50:03,060
with a partner

1073
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:04,560
how many times have I heard like the

1074
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:06,180
first six months of a brand new

1075
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:09,540
relationship

1076
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:11,520
and it's like out of control right and

1077
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:14,160
six months later or eight months later

1078
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:15,780
things seem to kind of calm down they

1079
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:17,760

1080
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:22,160

co-worker co-workers

1086
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:41,700
whether with the excitement of going on

1087
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:44,339
a vacation or taking time off to do

1088
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:45,900
something we love whether deciding to go

1089
00:50:44,339 --> 00:50:48,960
skiing one day or riding a motorcycle

1090
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:51,599
anything we do adrenaline plays a role I

1091
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:54,000
know people they made vacations after

1092
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:56,400
their vacations

1093
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:58,980
they go on a big vacation they come back

1094
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:01,680
they need a vacation so they go and take

1095
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:03,839
a vacation after they had a big long

1096
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:05,940
vacation

1097
00:51:03,839 --> 00:51:08,220
and then you need a vacation after that

1098
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:10,380
vacation and whoa if they're fortunate

1099
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:12,420
enough they can vacation all year long

1100
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:14,099

you have a good experience they're going

1119
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:58,160
they're off

1120
00:51:55,319 --> 00:51:58,160
you're going off

1121
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:01,940
some limes

1122
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:07,680
when that adrenaline touches electricity

1123
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:10,140
there's no electricity in my body

1124
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:11,040
there's no electricity in your body yeah

1125
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:12,660
there is

1126
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:14,280
there is

1127
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:16,500
we know that

1128
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:18,540
when that electricity electrician yeah

1129
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:20,460
you need electrician sometimes for that

1130
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:24,300
electricity in the body when that is

1131
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:27,920
your cut cut cut edit edit

1132
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:27,920
we're live we don't do that

1133
00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:33,599
healthy adrenaline helps fuel the

1134
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:35,099
electrical Grid it's undiscovered by

1135
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:37,140
medical research and science that

1136
00:52:35,099 --> 00:52:38,819
adrenaline is filled with receptor

1137
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:40,619
compounds so this is something that's

1138
00:52:38,819 --> 00:52:42,599
really Advanced so the medical medium

1139
00:52:40,619 --> 00:52:45,180
books are highly Advanced right

1140
00:52:42,599 --> 00:52:47,280
information in here

1141
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:50,280
that you won't hear anywhere else

1142
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:52,500
but there are receptor compounds in

1143
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:54,540
Adrenaline these receptor compounds are

1144
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:56,700
designed for the electrical Grid in the

1145
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:58,740
brain only specifically for the

1146
00:52:56,700 --> 00:53:01,140
electrical Grid in the brain so when

1147
00:52:58,740 --> 00:53:04,559
adrenaline is released from your adrenal

1148
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:06,780
glands it's flowing through your body

1149
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:08,940
whether a good experience bad experience

1150
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:11,160
it's flowing through the body these

1151
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:12,720
receptors inside that adrenaline that's

1152
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:16,319
pumping right

1153
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:18,619
those receptors are designed for the

1154
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:18,619
brain

1155
00:53:20,099 --> 00:53:23,400
these receptor compounds are designed

1156
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:25,380
for the electrical Grid in the brain

1157
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:28,200
when the compounds hit the electricity

1158
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:31,500
of the brain your electrical impulse

1159
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:34,920
they light up and ignite like fireflies

1160
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:38,000
or like bugs hitting a bug zapper

1161
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:40,440
so is that adrenaline is you know

1162
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:43,140
entering the brain your brain is

1163
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:44,760
receiving that adrenaline it just lights

1164
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:48,000
up the grid

1165
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:50,579
fireflies and bugs adrenaline is a

1166
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,319
necessity in small healthy amounts we

1167
00:53:50,579 --> 00:53:54,000
required it in all everyday living and

1168
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:55,500
functioning adrenaline behaves

1169
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:58,980
differently

1170
00:53:55,500 --> 00:54:01,440
from oxygen while adrenaline Burns Like

1171
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:04,800
Oxygen inside the body it does so with a

1172
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:06,839
more rapid aggressive intense heat so

1173
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:09,599
oxygen that gets inside your bloodstream

1174
00:54:06,839 --> 00:54:11,700
gets your brain actually Burns it gets

1175
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:14,220
utilized

1176
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:16,800
but adrenaline is much more intense

1177
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:19,200
adrenaline's Fire doesn't squelch easily

1178
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:21,000
with water and glucose although water

1179
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:22,680
hydration and glucose are still critical

1180
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,359
to address the brain heat from

1181
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:25,619
adrenaline so here's something that

1182
00:54:24,359 --> 00:54:28,200
happens

1183
00:54:25,619 --> 00:54:31,740
a lot of people stroke out

1184
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:34,020
I'm serious a lot of people stroke out

1185
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:36,059
because it's all

1186
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:40,859
timing

1187
00:54:36,059 --> 00:54:43,980
it's all like that Perfect Storm

1188
00:54:40,859 --> 00:54:46,740
chronic dehydration not enough glucose

1189
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:48,960
in the brain not enough hydration to the

1190
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:52,460
brain

1191
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:56,220
and then the right amount of aggravation

1192
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:59,640
all of it combined low-grade viral

1193
00:54:56,220 --> 00:55:02,520
infections immune systems down low in

1194
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:05,900
this perfect storm and if they were just

1195
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:05,900
hydrated a little bit more

1196
00:55:06,059 --> 00:55:09,260
could have made all the difference

1197
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:14,599
prevent it you know that ischemic attack

1198
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:22,559
imagine you're experiencing something

1199
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:25,980
good skiing down a slope is that good

1200
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:27,300
a lot of people love it

1201
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:30,359
I mean

1202
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:31,859
maybe I'm just a downer am I just like a

1203
00:55:30,359 --> 00:55:33,480
downer

1204
00:55:31,859 --> 00:55:35,579
you don't want to see people skiing down

1205
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:37,740
the slope I'm like whoa whoa whoa break

1206
00:55:35,579 --> 00:55:39,839
breaking no could break a leg nope that

1207
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:41,760
could blow look out

1208
00:55:39,839 --> 00:55:43,260
but I'm just worried about everybody so

1209
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:44,460
that's just me I know people don't give

1210
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:45,720
a A lot of people don't give a

1211
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:47,400
and they'll just be like whatever people

1212
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:50,339
do what they're gonna do but actually

1213
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:53,040
I'm concerned take me to a ski slope

1214
00:55:50,339 --> 00:55:55,200
hanging out and I'll just be like whoa

1215
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:57,780
just be careful whoa

1216
00:55:55,200 --> 00:56:00,000
someone just tore their ankle off their

1217
00:55:57,780 --> 00:56:01,920
body

1218
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,480
your adrenal's pumping because you're

1219
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:06,000
about to hit a tricky spot so when

1220
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:07,980
you're skiing just say I'm just using

1221
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,720
that as an example right here and you're

1222
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:12,420
hitting heading for a tricky spot your

1223
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:16,339
adrenals are just

1224
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:16,339
just releasing and releasing

1225
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:19,859
and that's what's you know that's

1226
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:21,240
interesting because if you had an injury

1227
00:56:19,859 --> 00:56:24,660
doing something

1228
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:27,660
right you may not feel that injury as

1229
00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:30,960
much as someone else feels an injury

1230
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:33,920
because the adrenaline was pumping

1231
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:33,920
during that injury

1232
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:37,800
for the excitement of that challenge

1233
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:39,660
alone it's worth it to go when you go

1234
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:40,940
down the slope right that excitement of

1235
00:56:39,660 --> 00:56:43,079
the adrenaline it's worth it alone

1236
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:44,520
Euphoria and Clarity come when

1237
00:56:43,079 --> 00:56:47,220
adrenaline is hitting the electrical

1238
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:49,500
grid during a good experience

1239
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:51,800
it puts you in the feeling of being in

1240
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:54,059
the zone

1241
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:55,140
even like it's like finding a new

1242
00:56:54,059 --> 00:56:57,359
relationship

1243
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:59,700
you're falling in love

1244
00:56:57,359 --> 00:57:02,280
and you're just in the zone

1245
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:04,680
that adrenaline is just pumping

1246
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:06,240
Stacy Island on YouTube I missed you

1247
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:08,700
it's so great to see you great to be

1248
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:10,559
back it is

1249
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:12,119
as your adrenals start filling your

1250
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:15,720
blood with adrenaline all that

1251
00:57:12,119 --> 00:57:15,720
adrenaline gasoline

1252
00:57:15,839 --> 00:57:21,599
reaches your brain and ignites its

1253
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:23,640
electrical Grid it's more adrenaline and

1254
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:25,319
a more intense blend of adrenaline than

1255
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:26,940
the gentle mild levels of adrenaline

1256
00:57:25,319 --> 00:57:28,859
hitting your electrical grid when you're

1257
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:31,140
showering or brushing your teeth so that

1258
00:57:28,859 --> 00:57:33,359
leads to this if you're doing the

1259
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:35,579
simplest things and

1260
00:57:33,359 --> 00:57:37,619
don't get me wrong brushing your teeth

1261
00:57:35,579 --> 00:57:39,059
is actually sometimes an impossibility

1262
00:57:37,619 --> 00:57:40,380
for somebody who's got chronic illness

1263
00:57:39,059 --> 00:57:42,240
and they're struggling they can't even

1264
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:44,040
stand up long enough in the bathroom to

1265
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:46,920
brush their teeth or they don't have

1266
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:47,880
strength in their arms and so forth to

1267
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:49,800
do so

1268
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:53,040
that's something on the screen here so

1269
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:53,040
yeah and

1270
00:57:54,839 --> 00:57:59,760
so the point is is that so many people

1271
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:01,380
they don't have the ability to shower so

1272
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:03,420
easy they don't have the ability to

1273
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:05,220
function so easy it takes adrenaline to

1274
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:06,780
do all that but when you're really

1275
00:58:05,220 --> 00:58:09,000
struggling with chronic illness

1276
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:10,079
sometimes it's like impossible and it's

1277
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:12,000
really hard

1278
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:14,640
I've seen over the years people chronic

1279
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:18,240
illness just the water hitting their

1280
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:20,220
back or their head in the shower it's

1281
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:22,319
just too much after they get out of the

1282
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:25,700
shower and they get to their mattress

1283
00:58:22,319 --> 00:58:29,420
Island they're done for an hour or more

1284
00:58:25,700 --> 00:58:29,420
that was a big thing

1285
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:36,359
see George Payne says

1286
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:38,339
which one of the books is Anthony

1287
00:58:36,359 --> 00:58:42,559
reading

1288
00:58:38,339 --> 00:58:42,559
brain saver right here page 90.

1289
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:50,760
as your adrenals are feeling start

1290
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:53,099
filling up your blood with adrenaline

1291
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:57,059
all that adrenaline like I said becomes

1292
00:58:53,099 --> 00:58:59,460
like fuel for the fire gasoline

1293
00:58:57,059 --> 00:59:01,619
it reaches your brain and ignites its

1294
00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:04,079
electrical grid

1295
00:59:01,619 --> 00:59:06,240
it's more adrenaline and a more intense

1296
00:59:04,079 --> 00:59:08,460
blend of adrenaline than the gentle mild

1297
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:10,020
levels like I was saying of showering or

1298
00:59:08,460 --> 00:59:12,599
brushing your teeth or going to the

1299
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:14,760
bathroom it takes adrenaline

1300
00:59:12,599 --> 00:59:17,040
to do number two

1301
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:19,680

delivers a blow you never thought

1323
01:00:11,819 --> 01:00:15,660
possible

1324
01:00:13,140 --> 01:00:18,660

haven't been in this book in a while

1335
01:00:48,119 --> 01:00:51,260
that's insane

1336
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:59,180
the reason you get this adrenaline fire

1337
01:00:56,760 --> 01:01:01,920
is to provide Clarity and faster

1338
01:00:59,180 --> 01:01:04,559
thinking and the strength to override

1339
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:07,680
any mental blocks or smaller injuries

1340
01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:09,119
already in the brain so many people have

1341
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:12,900
smaller injuries in the brain they don't

1342
01:01:09,119 --> 01:01:14,700
know it all kinds of things in the brain

1343
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:16,260
talk about that in the brain books so

1344
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:17,940
you can be quick on your feet during

1345
01:01:16,260 --> 01:01:20,040
this this challenging emotional

1346
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:21,480
experience you got to be quick on your

1347
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:23,220
feet when you have an emotional

1348
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:25,500
experience like that

1349
01:01:23,220 --> 01:01:28,200
the adrenaline fire is there to help set

1350
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:30,599
you on A New Path power you to a safer

1351
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:32,880
land and new experiences so it's not

1352
01:01:30,599 --> 01:01:35,880
like this terrible thing you're betrayed

1353
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:39,900
and you got an adrenaline surge

1354
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:41,819
but it's there to power you through this

1355
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:43,440
adrenaline fire is also why when

1356
01:01:41,819 --> 01:01:46,920
somebody goes through an emotional

1357
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:49,500
experience they can feel so drained and

1358
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:52,940
worn out afterward that it's difficult

1359
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:52,940
to function for months

1360
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:57,059
that ain't no joke

1361
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:59,339
when the adrenaline subsides from the

1362
01:01:57,059 --> 01:02:02,760
electrical grid feelings of sadness and

1363
01:01:59,339 --> 01:02:04,440
depression or brain exhaustion can be

1364
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:06,180
elevated if you had a difficult

1365
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:07,680
situation any kind of emotional

1366
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:11,940
experience with somebody else any kind

1367
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:14,700
of Confrontation abuse or any kind of

1368
01:02:11,940 --> 01:02:18,059
struggle emotionally with others

1369
01:02:14,700 --> 01:02:21,960
something happens betrayal you feel

1370
01:02:18,059 --> 01:02:24,599
sadness depression anger back to

1371
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:27,119
depression back to sadness and then you

1372
01:02:24,599 --> 01:02:30,619
feel a brain exhaustion

1373
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:30,619
and that can elevate

1374
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:37,980
it's why bouncing back can take so long

1375
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:42,420
so many people need to have time to

1376
01:02:37,980 --> 01:02:44,220
bounce back anytime to bounce back

1377
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:46,440
Erica Brown says I know that feeling

1378
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:51,079
from abuse also

1379
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:51,079
it's just it's I it's so true

1380
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:58,559
I'm sorry you've gone through anything

1381
01:02:56,579 --> 01:03:02,160
it's why bouncing back can take so long

1382
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:04,020
and why some don't even bounce back

1383
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:05,339
some don't even bounce back I mean

1384
01:03:04,020 --> 01:03:07,980
that's why we need to do things for our

1385
01:03:05,339 --> 01:03:10,880
brain and heal and do things and work on

1386
01:03:07,980 --> 01:03:10,880
our healing process

1387
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:18,900
and some don't even bounce back

1388
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:20,880
and why some

1389
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:23,520
struggle so much if the brain is up

1390
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:26,760
against acidity deficiencies poisons and

1391
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:30,180
toxins which the books talk about like

1392
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:31,799
in in detail it's all the harder to

1393
01:03:30,180 --> 01:03:36,740
recover from the intense adrenaline

1394
01:03:31,799 --> 01:03:36,740
