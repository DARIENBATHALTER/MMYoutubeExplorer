1
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:07,399
so I'm on here right now because I want

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:10,080
to show you a couple tips one when

3
00:00:07,399 --> 00:00:12,639
there's smoke in the air because of the

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,920
LA fires right now things are really bad

5
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:15,599
for a lot of people I mean it's

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,920
devastating I'm sure you guys have seen

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,720
it out there people losing their homes

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:23,880
people losing their Farms their

9
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:27,560
businesses their family's homes their

10
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:30,480
apartment buildings they're losing their

11
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,560
places to live massive

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,920
I mean there's all kinds of things

13
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:36,559
people are evacuating all around in LA

14
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,600
and trying to get out there so anyway I

15
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:41,719
just wanted to come on here just uh for

16
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:43,559
a couple of tips number one um I think

17
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:47,120
one of the big things is because the air

18
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:51,600
is so dry so so

19
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:53,559
dry that the Ash and the air it just

20
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,559
cuts through it just gets into the lungs

21
00:00:53,559 --> 00:00:58,399
really easily and I think that's really

22
00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:00,199
hard for a lot of people so one of the

23
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:03,160
things that you can do is you can like

24
00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:05,400
an n95 mask it's going to help a little

25
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:07,560
bit I mean it's obviously not going to

26
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,360
protect you with flames and heavy heavy

27
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:13,479
smoke but it can actually block some of

28
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:16,680
the ashes it can block some of the thick

29
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:18,560
smoke some of the toxins that are in the

30
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,079
smoke like the chemicals and things that

31
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:25,600
are burning in furniture and

32
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:28,560
carpets and wall boards and treated wood

33
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,759
all that and plaster all that stuff

34
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,960
that's burning that's really toxic from

35
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:35,720
houses and homes so um you know there's

36
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,159
a couple of uh tricks I want to show

37
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:39,840
people while we're here you guys coming

38
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:41,640
on right here this is great but I want

39
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,880
to First all first of all I want to just

40
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:47,439
say that if you are if you were coming

46
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:03,399
notices going out to you if you did

47
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:06,280
purchase a ticket for that popup dinner

48
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:08,759
on the 15th or the 16th we're postponing

49
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:10,959
it just you know for for a lot of

50
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:12,840
reasons one is just for protective

51
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:15,160
Health measures and everything else it's

52
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,560
really Smoky and so forth out there but

53
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:19,360
at the same time Cafe Gratitude is

54
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,920
they're open and they have medical

55
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,280
medium dishes there so if you're

56
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:25,319
somebody you know and you need to grab

57
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,200
some food that's a place to grab some

58
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:28,879
really healthy food which is really

59
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,280
great you can grab a medical medium dish

60
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:32,319
in there if you're somebody that's doing

61
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:34,599
medical medium tools and medical medium

62
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,680
Foods so that's what's amazing about the

63
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:38,480
maafe gratitude that they they're there

64
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:41,360
and they have medical medium food on

65
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,599
hand so if you're traveling through or

66
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:47,599
if you're relocating in the area you can

67
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:49,599
run in and you can get food there um you

68
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:52,239
know dishes there which is really

69
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:54,319
incredible so but if you happen to have

70
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:57,120
a ticket it's next week was supposed to

71
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:59,280
be next week on the 15th and the 16th if

72
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,159
you did have a ticket and you were

73
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,040
coming to LA to be there for the meet

74
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:06,920
and greet with me I'm not going to be

75
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:09,799
there so we're postponing it and we'll

76
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:11,599
have dates pretty soon just not yet and

77
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:14,400
you'll get a refund in a whole bit and

78
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:16,360
then we will send out some notices and

79
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,239
such such so that you can actually get

80
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:21,040
the tickets again and all that um so

81
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:22,760
it's going to be great but right now

82
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,599
there's a lot of Devastation happening

83
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:27,519
you guys know I want to go I want to

84
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:31,319
cover a couple of points first is

85
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:33,879
because the air is so dry

86
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:35,680
because um you well here's the problem

87
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:37,439
too with the smoke this the smoke

88
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,080
inhalation that people are dealing with

89
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:42,599
right now even if you're like miles away

90
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,879
from it you live miles away from it but

91
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:46,959
it's in the air because it's a lot of

92
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:49,120
stuff there's there's fire retardant in

93
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:52,000
the air that they're dropping down it's

94
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,079
a dust like a dust particle like almost

95
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,760
like an aerosol that's floating around

96
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:57,360
people are going to be breathing that in

97
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,439
so if you're exposed and you're out of

98
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,879
your house and so forth one thing you

99
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:05,040
can do is you take a towel like this and

100
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:07,560
I've said this before with other fires

101
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:10,319
over the years but you take a towel okay

102
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:12,560
and you moisten it so this is really

103
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:16,239
important right here you moisten it

104
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:21,600
right here I'm squeezing out the water

105
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:24,479
okay just like that all right and you

106
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,120
breathe through the towel a moist towel

107
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,880
that's important you can you can

108
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:31,240
actually make it as thin as you want you

109
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:33,440
can double it up depending on how it it

110
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:35,919
feels

111
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:38,280
but you could do this too you can hold

112
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:40,320
it just like this and you can put it

113
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:43,120
over your face and you can breathe

114
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:45,560
through it so what happens is the water

115
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:48,960
is what catches a lot of the toxins a

116
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:50,560
lot of that dust a lot of the ashes all

117
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,919
the stuff that's coming off of people's

118
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,039
wallboards all the paint That's burning

119
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:56,639
on their

120
00:04:54,039 --> 00:05:00,360
houses um all the carpets like I said

121
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:01,759
the furniture all that stuff and all the

122
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,759
different chemicals the household

123
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:06,199
cleaners they're all burning up in

124
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,919
people's houses all the aerosol cans all

125
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:11,160
the spray bottles of cleaners and so

126
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:13,720
forth all the oil containers in people's

127
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:16,160
garages you know gasoline in people's

128
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,960
garages and and and all that so all the

129
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,680
stuff is in the air plus what they're

130
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:22,000
dropping on the fires like the fiery T

131
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:24,960
 and everything they're dropping

132
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,039
that all on everybody and you know and

133
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,600
it's really tough when that that hair is

134
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:31,120
really really tough if you're dealing

135
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:34,600
with it now if you're in it I feel so

136
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:36,280
bad for you but um so one of the things

137
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,360
if you're moving around you get a couple

138
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:41,080
of towels like that you keep them moist

139
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:43,600
and damp if you're traveling through it

140
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:46,039
you grab it you put it over your face

141
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,840
like this and you breathe through it and

142
00:05:46,039 --> 00:05:50,440
you'll see the difference what happens

143
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,840
is that that air is so dry because that

144
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:54,720
air is so dry it's how it kind of gets

145
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:57,560
you it's not just the oxygen loss in the

146
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,960
air we're already somewhere around 19%

147
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:02,280
oxygen as it is out there give give or

148
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,520
take on what day the atmosphere and

149
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:07,000
everything else on this planet and

150
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:09,000
pollution and all that but oxygen is

151
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,919
going to probably go down to

152
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:16,560
15% 14% in certain areas somewhere

153
00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:19,199
around there and it isn't just the

154
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,800
oxygen loss it's going to be the

155
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,400
particles it's all going to be the

156
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:26,800
particles and what this does is it grabs

157
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:29,199
the particles moist towels grab the

158
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,440
particles and you can do it we could if

159
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:33,720
you're in your house you don't have air

160
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,400
cleaners it's coming into the house a

161
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,360
lot you might want to do this

162
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:39,039
periodically and then you change it out

163
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,479
you rinse it out you change the water

164
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:44,160
out too you do fresh water and you dump

165
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:46,360
that water out you'll notice when you do

166
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,240
it for a while the water starts to get

167
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,680
kind of

168
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:53,639
skunky and the water starts to get kind

169
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:55,879
of um gets kind of murky and that murky

170
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:58,039
is how much is floating in the air how

171
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:59,919
much of that Ash how much of those

172
00:06:58,039 --> 00:07:02,280
particles are floating in the air and it

173
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,680
gets trapped in the towel so you know

174
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,560
and then when things come down or you

175
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,120
get an air cleaner and you're able to

176
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:10,120
you know suck some of that up in the air

177
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:12,680
you know you're better off but and you

178
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,960
don't have to have it real wet can just

179
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:17,599
be

180
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:20,599
damp um a lot of air escapes this isn't

181
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:24,240
like a mask a lot of air escapes through

182
00:07:20,599 --> 00:07:29,039
a towel through a shirt okay it's not

183
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:30,759
like uh a really good mask respirator on

184
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:33,520
there and everything thing filters on

185
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:36,479
there it's not like that and even that

186
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:38,360
it Escapes in it's the moisture Factor

187
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:40,800
that's missing in the air it's the

188
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:42,319
moisture factor that allows it to really

189
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,199
travel and get into the lungs and into

190
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,720
the bloodstream so I'm just letting

191
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,960
people know and maybe this doesn't even

192
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,400
matter for you and you don't need to

193
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,400
worry about this or think about this

194
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:55,440
you're nowhere near any of this

195
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:58,720
stuff but if you are this is a great

196
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:01,319
technique it's a very stable technique I

197
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,120
mean you don't want to go into a fire

198
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:05,639
with it and expect it to help you it's

199
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,759
not like that but it helps you if you're

200
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:10,720
in your home you're dealing with some

201
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:12,960
smoke that's coming through you're not

202
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,400
leaving you can't go you you know you're

203
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,639
just you're staying in that home you're

204
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:19,440
staying in that apartment air is bad

205
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:22,560
outside the whole bit you can do this or

206
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:25,080
you got to go you got to go get food you

207
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,639
got to get out of the house smoking in

208
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:29,599
there and it's you know and what happens

209
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:31,919
if you put your shirt or you wear one of

210
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:33,800
those those masks that people wore those

211
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:35,880
black masks and so forth those cloth

212
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:39,320
masks and everything that people wore

213
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:42,080
during the whole sea thing the

214
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:45,640
dryness just doesn't stop it so those

215
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:49,000
masks just don't stop it I saw like one

216
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:51,200
news guy earlier today on social and the

217
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
news guy had one of those masks right

218
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,320
it's like the cloth one the one that

219
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,360
people wore during sea and still wear it

220
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,800
now a lot of people do and the guy was

221
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,519
out there and you see the air and the

222
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:04,320
smoke and the ashes blowing around I'm

223
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:06,519
like that's not stopping anything

224
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,680
because there's no moisture in it

225
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:10,600
there's no moisture in it it's just not

226
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:13,399
there so what what it really needed to

227
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:16,600
do was periodically you know take a

228
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:17,920
towel and just hold it over like this

229
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,800
and there might be another way to do

230
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,640
that too but hold it over like this and

231
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,800
have it stuck on your face put it right

232
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,959
to your face and leave an air opening

233
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:30,880
like a little like a gap in there so you

234
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:34,360
got like you know some Ro in there and

235
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:37,360
you breathe and like I said that cotton

236
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:39,360
that fabric with the moisture grabs on

237
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,000
to it and if you feel like the air is

238
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,000
really bad the Smoke's really bad you

239
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,560
can double it up so you can do this then

240
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,839
you know instead of having it on its

241
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:50,640
thinnest like this that's its thinnest

242
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:52,800
you know could be like a washcloth

243
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,880
whatever right washcloth this is just a

244
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,600
hand towel like a kitchen towel you can

245
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,200
have it at its thinnest if for some

246
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:01,760
reason it's really bad then you double

247
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,920
it up make this makes a huge difference

248
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,959
now you double it up like that okay now

249
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:10,720
it's double got right two layers if it's

250
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:13,600
really really bad you need to do four

251
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:16,320
layers that's four layers right there

252
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,399
boom got your hands like this put it

253
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,600
over your

254
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:23,200
face and you breathe and that moisture

255
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:26,200
and those four layers acts like really

256
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:28,000
strong filter and then all those ashes a

257
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:31,040
lot of the toxins the chemicals the

258
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,000
smoke all of that boom it gets caught in

259
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,200
there so you're not getting so much into

260
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,399
your lungs so if you can you need to

261
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,600
move move around about you know and get

262
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:41,399
someplace or get food or go here go

263
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,720
there because it's it's going to be

264
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:44,519
there for a while the Smoke's going to

265
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,920
be there for a while it's not just going

266
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:50,200
away tomorrow and it's just not it's

267
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:53,720
it's actually just as bad if not getting

268
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:55,160
worse tonight until tomorrow for sure

269
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,440
and they don't have any you know none of

270
00:10:55,160 --> 00:11:00,160
its contained from you know from when

271
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:02,120
you look into it um if you're somebody

272
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,680

supplementation you know for after the

286
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:40,600
fact as well you get some plays you're

287
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:43,160

when it goes into the lungs and it goes

291
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,760
into the bloodstream what happens with

292
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:51,519
chronic illness when people have chronic

293
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:53,959
illness and they're struggling it could

294
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:57,160
be a trigger all those toxins all those

295
00:11:53,959 --> 00:11:59,720
poisons floating around Metals so the

296
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:01,279
hmds is in this packet right here and

297
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:04,440
you guys already do the

298
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:05,519
hmds a lot of you guys do anyway a lot

299
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,600
of the people in the medical mem

300
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:11,160
Community do the

301
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,480
hmds and so the reason why the hmds is

302
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:15,680
really good because you're capturing

303
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:18,160
metals that are going into the lungs and

304
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,199
into the bloodstream and quickly into

305
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:23,040
the

306
00:12:19,199 --> 00:12:24,920
liver and you're capturing those metals

307
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,760
because that's what it is you know all

308
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:29,639
these homes are burning all these

309
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:34,519
buildings are burning churches are built

310
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:36,680
burning um uh buildings are burning all

311
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:38,360
the office buildings are burning and so

312
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:40,959
you're thinking about like what is in

313
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:42,360
that smoke and it's a tremendous amount

314
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:45,360
of

315
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:49,839
metals that's what's in there treaded

316
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:51,639
wood carpets wallboard metal it's just

317
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:54,959

burning including steel

319
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:59,839
aluminum that's in the air all of it so

320
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:03,000

321
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:05,920

00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:48,680
with something like that but you can't

365
00:14:45,079 --> 00:14:53,000
do anything about it this helps more

366
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:54,600
than people know more than people know

367
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,839
and so what happens you'll notice if you

368
00:14:54,600 --> 00:15:00,199
use it a couple times and even if it's

369
00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:01,560
like a half an hour to you're dealing

370
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:03,920
with something where you have to open

371
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:05,560
the doors in the house open the windows

372
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,399
for some reason you open the doors to

373
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:10,120
let a pet out or something like that and

374
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:12,279
then the smoke just Barrels in and you

375
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:14,320
shut the door and you don't have a good

376
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:16,800
air cleaner or air cleaning

377
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,720
system and um and now you're just

378
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,360
feeling like it's just getting to you

379
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,680
and it makes your chest heavy and if

380
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:25,600
you're somebody with chronic illness

381
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:27,720
it's really hard really really hard it

382
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:30,639
can be a trigger I talk about smoke as

383
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:33,040
being a trigger in the medical books so

384
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:35,440
I have over the years talked about that

385
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:38,240
it is a trigger it's nothing to fear but

386
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:40,360
it is a trigger and so protecting your

387
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:43,720
immune system taking care of

388
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:47,440
yourself um all of that counts all of

389
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:50,560
that's important that's why this is not

390
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:52,440
just for you know not just for the

391
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,759
problem in the Moment Like good air

392
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:56,120
cleaners and then the hand towel the

393
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:57,759
moist hand towel it's also

394
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:59,519
supplementation building up your immune

395
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:01,880
system because that's what gets knocked

396
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:05,519
down so when we're breathing in all that

397
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:07,160
smoke that Rogue smoke that's just

398
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,920
coming from all these different things

399
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:12,560
burning out there it's trying on the

400
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:14,360
immune system it's heavy on the immune

401
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:18,199
system it's difficult on the immune

402
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:21,160
system so it's important to Boom jack up

403
00:16:18,199 --> 00:16:24,600
that immune system make it stronger get

404
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:27,680
it in a better place very important very

405
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:29,800
important so keep that in mind all right

406
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:32,519
all of that counts also everyone is

407
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:37,120
already fighting guess what the

408
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:39,680
flu and the new bugs coming so they name

409
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:42,279
flues different things like you

410
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:45,440
know like respiratory different

411
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:48,319
respiratory names and so forth and they

412
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:50,160
name flu differently all the time but in

413
00:16:48,319 --> 00:16:53,279
the end they're really just bad

414
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:55,000
flu and they like to change the names

415
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:59,160
cuz they like to make it look like it's

416
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:01,319
not a flu they do that too where is why

417
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:05,240
they do that by the way if you want to

418
00:17:01,319 --> 00:17:06,679
really know is because it's getting out

419
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,439
there finally I've talked about it for

420
00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:12,319
years and I've even talked about it

421
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:16,199
medical medium books and stuff it's flu

422
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:18,480
don't just exist they're not out there

423
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:22,000
because they happen just to be out there

424
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:25,679
they're let out of the gate every single

425
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:28,679
year twice a year they let let a new one

426
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:30,240
out they like to rename them they rename

427
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:32,200
them because it makes it look like

428
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,640
they're not letting them out you know

429
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:36,520
there's that whole game that's played

430
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:38,039
too when it comes down to bugs but right

431
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:41,080
now with everybody that's dealing with

432
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:44,520
flu and they're dealing with respiratory

433
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:45,640
bugs andc they're dealing with that too

434
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:48,480
it's important to keep your immune

435
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:50,160
system strong especially with smoke and

436
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,200
this Smoke's this smoke is going to

437
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,559
travel all around the country different

438
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,280
wind currents are going to take it the

439
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:56,520
jet stream stream is going to take it

440
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,360
it's going to be just floating around

441
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:00,360
everywhere including all the fire fire

442
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:02,240
retardant so it's important to have

443
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:04,039
options here here you got the seven top

444
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,000

ginger water great for the immune system

450
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:21,000
cucumber juice because you want

451
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:23,000
hydration on a different level to get

452
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,240
poisons and toxins out of the

453
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,960

483
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:58,159
important there is a Chemtrails

484
00:19:55,559 --> 00:20:01,120
exposure very important too here's what

485
00:19:58,159 --> 00:20:02,760
happens right got all the smoke out

486
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:06,320
there

487
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:10,280
okay homes houses mansions are

488
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:12,400
burning from small houses to mansions to

489
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:15,840
schools everything's just burning up

490
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,799
right now so what happens is then all of

491
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,880
a

492
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:22,039
sudden higher powers on the planet take

493
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,960
advantage of these situations and they

494
00:20:22,039 --> 00:20:27,240
end up

495
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:30,840
directing Sea Trail planes in the

496
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:31,880
direction and the dropping that too salt

497
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:34,960
in the

498
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:38,039
wound that's how it's

499
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:39,679
done but that's that's the process so

500
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:41,760
not only is this happening you got all

501
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:44,919
the smoke and all these toxins in the

502
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:47,880
air but then all of a sudden it's like

503
00:20:44,919 --> 00:20:49,320
yep send the Sea Trail planes send them

504
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:52,320
on

505
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:53,440
over dropping out that too it's not like

506
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,760
they

507
00:20:53,440 --> 00:21:00,840
stop it's not like they stop there isn't

508
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:02,440
some like magic wand to wave and be like

509
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,520
okay well we already have this problem

510
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:05,559
here now with all these fires and all

511
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:08,640
this bad

512
00:21:05,559 --> 00:21:11,799
smoke children with asthma are

513
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:14,559
struggling people are suffering from it

514
00:21:11,799 --> 00:21:18,159
but the so why don't you just stop the

515
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:21,720
sea trails in this area nope doesn't

516
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:24,039
work like that but that's how evil works

517
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:25,480
it's how Darkness works it's like you

518
00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:27,919
got all the smoke and all the stuff

519
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:30,760
happening and no higher power on the

520
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:32,480
planet goes all right let's dial down

521
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:35,320
all the Sea Trail

522
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:38,360
planes they have enough trouble so let's

523
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:40,279
get rid of those 1,400 planes that are

524
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:42,279
going to fly over just in the next

525
00:21:40,279 --> 00:21:44,720
couple of days and drop chemicals out of

526
00:21:42,279 --> 00:21:46,159
them let's just I'm not talking about

527
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,880
fire retardants coming out of

528
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:49,960
helicopters I'm talking about planes

529
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:51,640
with sea Trails so let's just stop that

530
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:54,240
but they don't so those are still

531
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:56,919
dumping they're just higher above all

532
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,120
that smoke those are dumping their crap

533
00:21:56,919 --> 00:22:00,880
and then you got the evildoers on the

534
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:04,799
planet that releasing the next bug

535
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:08,159
respiratory bug which they already have

536
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:10,440
it's already on its

537
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:12,919
way next few months people are going to

538
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:15,360
be coughing their guts out so it's

539
00:22:12,919 --> 00:22:17,559
important to protect the immune system

540
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,360
let's just be straightforward on that

541
00:22:17,559 --> 00:22:20,799
really

542
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:23,240
important so nobody's stopping the next

543
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:27,159
bug they're releasing nobody's stopping

544
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:29,240
the sea Trails just because their smoke

545
00:22:27,159 --> 00:22:31,919
they still keep all that in

546
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:33,200
all that's happening and the smoke and

547

because here's what here's here's how it

560
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:10,679
works okay unless you're just you're

561
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:13,240
just trying to survive and you're eating

562
00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:14,960
whatever you have to eat nothing wrong

563
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:16,640
with that if you're trying to survive

564
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,000
and you're just you're in a bad place

565
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,600
and you're figuring how to survive in

566
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,279
that smoke and everything and you're

567
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:25,919
eating what you just need to eat totally

568
00:23:22,279 --> 00:23:28,679
respect that totally understand okay of

569
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:31,840
course but there are some powerful Foods

570
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:34,440
you can eat to help get rid of toxins

571
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:36,400
faster that you're inhaling inhalence

572
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,679
that you're getting in your lungs so

573
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,880
that's

574
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:42,159
important and then we got the towel

575
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:44,320
right here if you have to go outside

576
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:46,320
when air quality is poor such as walking

577
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,960
to your car or grocery store or

578
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:51,559
traveling to your workspace this simple

579
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:54,240
tip can help traff and reduce inhalation

580
00:23:51,559 --> 00:23:57,679
of smoke and some of the toxins in the

581
00:23:54,240 --> 00:24:00,400
dust and smoke in the air and that's it

582
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:02,559
place a CLE clean cloth under the faucet

583
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:05,440
or in a bowl right here of water so the

584
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:08,120
entire cloth is wet ring excess water

585
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:10,880
out like I did of the cloth so it is

586
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:14,159
damp but not dripping with water keep

587
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:17,000
that in mind damp but not dripping with

588
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:19,760
water use both hands to pick up the damp

589
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,840
clo cloth leaving some space between

590
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:24,279
your hands so you can place it over your

591
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:27,279
nose and mouth and breathe through the

592
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:28,559
damp cloth and like I said if you're

593
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:29,720
you're trying to go somewhere you're

594
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:31,679
going to the grocery store you're

595
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:33,679
traveling to a

596
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:35,640
workplace if you're in your house and

597
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:38,000
the house is filling up but you got

598
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:39,120
nowhere to go and you just have to live

599
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,799
with it that's what you're telling

600
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:43,080

00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:20,679
sea

664
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:22,679
Trails over the fires nobody's cutting

665
00:27:20,679 --> 00:27:26,840
those off they just let those pour out

666
00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:28,640
of jets and planes whatever and um I

667
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:30,440
know one stopping the next bug they let

668
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:33,080
out of the gate they manufacture and let

669
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:34,240

670
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:36,120
world and if you're somebody with

671
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:39,159

00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:44,320
something simple do celery

674
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:46,840
juice do some celery juice that's it

675
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:49,960
don't add anything in it straight celery

676
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:51,919
juice start with 2 oz if you need to

677
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:54,799
work yourself up to 8 ounces work

678
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:57,320

679
00:27:54,799 --> 00:28:01,080

capture it while it's going in and flush

686
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:21,799
out the liver do some lemon water too

687
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:24,880

690
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:31,240
about Spirit of compassion is lemon

691
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:33,880
water was just like lemonade it was

692
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:37,559
refreshing put it in water add a little

693
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:40,720
sugar add a little honey

694
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:42,679
right that's what you do but to flush

695
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:45,399
the liver Spirit of compassion was like

696
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:47,840
well no you use this tool to flush the

697
00:28:45,399 --> 00:28:49,960
liver you use this tool to flush the

698
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:52,320
bloodstream first thing in the morning

699
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:53,840
that's what I love about medical meme

700
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:57,880
information

701
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:59,880
it's really amazing so cut a lemon in

702
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:03,080
half

703
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:05,480
squeeze it so what I would do if I was

704
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:07,440
in all that smoke and it was out there

705
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:09,880
and I had a live in it for a couple

706
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:12,320
weeks or a couple days or a month and

707
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:14,559
it's in the air

708
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:16,600
periodically I would be doing you know

709
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:18,039
lemon water every single morning staying

710
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:19,919
hydrated but you don't have to stay

711
00:29:18,039 --> 00:29:21,559
crazy hydrated you don't have to be like

712
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:22,360
drinking tons of water you don't have to

713
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:25,360
do

714
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:26,880
that yeah you don't have to go and do

715
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,679
that that's not doesn't mean that's

716
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,760
going to be helpful

717
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:34,159
but stay hydrated in the sense where

718
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:39,200
instead of a cup of coffee only in the

719
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:41,600
morning you're doing 16 o 32 o of lemon

720
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:43,440
water where it's a glass of water and

721
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,919
you squeeze a half a lemon in there and

722
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:48,480
that's what you do and you get that

723
00:29:44,919 --> 00:29:51,399
liver flush you get that body flush you

724
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:53,720
flush those toxins out especially if

725
00:29:51,399 --> 00:29:56,360
you're breathing in all that

726
00:29:53,720 --> 00:30:00,600
metal that's the people don't understand

727
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:03,679

728
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:06,399
