00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,280
live on youtube making the spinach soup

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,200
a

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:07,120
powerful healing tool from the medical

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,960
medium new edition

5
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,320
now you might be thinking i don't need

6
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,920
any spinach soup

7
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,160
doesn't sound that fun doesn't sound

8
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:17,279
that great but it's one of the most

9
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,760
powerful tools in the bunch of tools

10
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:21,920
and it's helped a lot of people heal and

11
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,039
i'm going to cover why it's important so

12
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,960
in a little bit i'm going to talk about

13
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,880
the stomach and what the spinach soup

14
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,359
does in your stomach how your stomach

15
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,599
lands

16
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,439
have to recover and repair so you can

17
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,440
have hydrochloric acid so you can break

18
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,399
down digest your proteins

19
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,840
have good digestive system good good gut

20
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,879
health austin good to see you

21
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,160
glad we're on here also talking about

22
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:44,719
science a little bit

23
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,960
science says if science says then hey

24
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:50,239
we're supposed to believe it right

25
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,199
um pia hi from the uk great glad you're

26
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:54,000
here i'm honored

27
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:55,120
fantastic good to see you guys coming on

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,920
um so

29
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:00,399
spinach soup is something that is really

30
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,719
healing on the intestinal lining

31
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,920
it's healing for the brain it's an

32
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:07,280
important

33
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:09,040
important uh basically recipe if you

34
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,400
want to call it i call it a healing tool

35
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,360
for the brain

36
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,400
mineral salts electrolytes these things

37
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,840
are critical

38
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:21,600
so and someone's got the brain fog

39
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:24,640
someone has bloating cramping

40
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,880
digestive problems and a lot of people

41
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,960
have

42
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,320
ammonia that builds up in their gut and

43
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,880
builds up in their gut and builds up

44
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,880
their guts

45
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,880
causes more and more trouble and that

46
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,200
ammonia can seep into the mouth and

47
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,240
people get the bad breath

48
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,360
proteins and fats rot in the in the

49
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:43,040
digestive

50
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,159
cavity right and people get in trouble

51
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,520
so the spinach soup is one of these

52
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,799
healing tools what i like about the

53
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,240
spinach soup is people that have

54
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:53,280
fibromyalgia

55
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:56,880
cfs the brain fog anxiety depression

56
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:59,119
uh anything like gout i mean any kind of

57
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,320
condition really the spinach soup is

58
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,759
really powerful it's

59
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,040
people with kidney disease kidney

60
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:03,920
problems i love the spinach soup for

61
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,399
that too

62
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,560
very healing so uh anyway guys great

63
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,200
mandy says is there any good guides for

64
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,560
people with

65
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:15,599
mthfr problems um well

66
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,120
the books have that information so liver

67
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:19,920
rescue talks about

68
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,280
mthfr gene mutation right here so you

69
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,200
can learn about it

70
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,640
and all the books the medical media

71
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,920
books talk about that we'll talk about

72
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,440
that in cleansing heal here's a great

73
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,920
one too

74
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,959
so you can learn about that and the sad

75
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,840
thing is

76
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:36,080
is that with the mthf mthfr gene

77
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,480
mutation

78
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,040
uh diagnoses what people don't realize

79
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,519
it's there's no gene mutation so

80
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,959
we get tricked we get full we get duped

81
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,440
that's how it's done

82
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,920
so that test when you when you get the

83
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,200
mthfr gene mutation test that's just an

84
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:55,120
inflammatory marker

85
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:57,920
they actually don't find a gene that's

86
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,560
mutated so it's it's important to know

87
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,959
that

88
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,239
so i mean if you want to know if you

89
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,840
need to

90
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,879
and i try to tell this to anybody if you

91
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,800
need to believe you have a gene mutation

92
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,879
and that's something that feels good

93
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,800
like hey that's my problem

94
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:15,200
that's why i'm sick that's why i have a

95
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,680
problem if that's what you need

96
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,040
to sleep at night then then that's okay

97
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,360
let it be a gene mutation

98
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,560
all right but if you're if you're

99
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,000
looking for

100
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,000
an answer if you're looking for the

101
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,840
truth if you're looking for

102
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,760
really fixing these problems you'll

103
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,640
learn from medical medium information

104
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,480
which

105
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,680
is information it's teaching doctors all

106
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,360
around the world

107
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,280
you'll learn that the gene mutation

108
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,560
isn't really what it is

109
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,360
that's why okay when people get rid of

110
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,280
their inf

111
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,480
inflammation and they're doing medical

112
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,760
medium information they're getting rid

113
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,720
of that inflammation and they're doing

114
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,200
medical medium

115
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:51,440
information right what happens is their

116
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,840
gene mutation goes away

117
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,120
it disappears so now they're at their

118
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,239
doctor's office whatever they get the

119
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,120
blood work

120
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,720
and the results come back and it's like

121
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,799
um

122
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,480
your gene mutation and we don't know how

123
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,599
this happened but your gene mutation

124
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,640
went away

125
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:10,400
it's gone and medical medium

126
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,000
people people who are doing medical

127
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,519
medium information learning how to heal

128
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,760
through the book's information

129
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,199
they hear this all the time i've been

130
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,160
hearing this for years

131
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,880
so even before the publication of this

132
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,320
this first

133
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,680
book this is the new edition right here

134
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,840
but the publication of the first book

135
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,560
with mthfr gene mutation

136
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,080
the test was always just an inflammatory

137
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,240
marker but you're going to be

138
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,840
misled and you're going to be led to

139
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,199
believe that you actually have a gene

140
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,600
mutation they're like oh my god

141
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,880
my son has a gene mutation my daughter

142
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,680
has a gene mutation

143
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,880
my mom has a gene mutation and that's

144
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,320
what you're gonna be told right

145
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,080
so you're gonna be thinking all that so

146
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,520
now you're walking around like wow my

147
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,720
genes are messed up

148
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:53,520
i got you know a messed up gene

149
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,759
i got a gene that's like denatured i got

150
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,000
a gene that mutated you know it's like

151
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:58,080
my

152
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,600
g mutated you see how what a screw up

153
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,880
this is in the industry

154
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:05,199
and so but really what it is

155
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,000
it's like a c-reactive protein test it's

156
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,000
like in

157
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,320
an anti-nuclear antigen test it's like

158
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,520
it's a psa test it's it's it's an

159
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,160
inflammation marker

160
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,520
that's all it is for some reason

161
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,720
pseudoscience

162
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,600
pseudoscience slipped in the door on

163
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,160
that one

164
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,039
and made that one made everybody think

165
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,639
that you

166
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:29,919
have a gene that mutated

167
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:33,919
see the big mistake right there and so

168
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:37,280
and genes that mutate don't ever

169
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:39,600
research in science don't ever change

170
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,560
that means you have this mutated gene

171
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,000
forever

172
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:47,120
for for a lifetime right then why

173
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:51,199
does everybody's gene mutations go

174
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:52,400
away the mth mthfr gene mutation go away

175
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,199
when they're doing medical medium

176
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,479
information

177
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,919
they're really doing it they're doing

178
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,720
their 32 ounces they're doing their

179
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,400
spinach soup

180
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,560
they're doing their heavy metal detox

181
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,880
smoothie right and they're

182
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,199
you're doing all these tools and their

183
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,639
gene mutation disappears it's not

184
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,280
supposed to disappear

185
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:11,280
it can't disappear once you have a

186
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,199
mutated gene

187
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:16,160
then that's what you have till the day

188
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:20,160
you die nothing changes that right

189
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:21,680
and because it was never a mutated gene

190
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,520
lorraine el says so much trickery the

191
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,680
trickery is unbelievable

192
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,199
the trickery is unbelievable and to the

193
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,759
degree people don't even

194
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,639
really realize so you're going to go to

195
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,360
the doctor you're going to go to your

196
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,639
function medical

197
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,479
functional medicine doctor and he's

198
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,160
going to draw a whole bunch of blood

199
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:38,160
he only needs this much for your gene

200
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,639
mutation test

201
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,000
okay you're ready for this all right he

202
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,039
only needs that much for your gene

203
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,600
mutation test

204
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,080
that's all he needs right but he's going

205
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,800
to take

206
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,759
seven vials out of your daughter and out

207
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,840
of your son

208
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,039
14 vials out of your son or daughter

209
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,759
okay or

210
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:58,000
he or she's gonna take five seven vials

211
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,280
10 vials 14 vials right

212
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,160
and you're going to get all your little

213
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,840
tests and they only need that much blood

214
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,360
so here they are they weaken your immune

215
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,680
system weaken your immune system they

216
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,280
take

217
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:12,160
tons of blood tons when it's adding up

218
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,960
all the different labs um you should

219
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,880
listen to the

220
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,520
medical medium podcast at apple podcast

221
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,759
and listen to the blood draw episode

222
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,720
but there's so much trickery in the

223
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,880
system

224
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,560
from the blood draw you're losing your

225
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,800
immune system during the blood draw

226
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,319
okay so they take all your blood so your

227
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,960
child children's blood just out the

228
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,000
window

229
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,440
it's oh your children's blood is it's

230
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,080
useless

231
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,639
it's disposable your children's blood is

232
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,000
just

233
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,560
dispensable it's it's just it's not

234
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,160
important

235
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,160
your the blood in your children is not

236
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,319
important you could just remove a ton of

237
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,560
it and just get rid of it throw it out

238
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,440
the lab only needs this much blab only

239
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,960
needs this much

240
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,479
but we're going to make sure we take all

241
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,400
the blood out of your children

242
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:55,919
that's what the system does okay and

243
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,720
they throw it all away

244
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,520
like they they train you because science

245
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,919
says

246
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:04,560
they train you to believe that your

247
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:06,960
children's blood is disposable

248
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,160
disposable that's what they train you to

249
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,000
believe

250
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,440
it's brainwashing so they brainwash

251
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,199
that's what they do

252
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:17,759
that's what they do and

253
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,520
i mean i mean it's crazy how it works

254
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:22,720
they the way they do that

255
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,720
they want you to believe

256
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,240
hold on guys i gotta take the phone call

257
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:36,080

00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,320
they're checking for a g-mutation test

270
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,000
and some other things too i forgot what

271
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,560
the doctor wanted to do

272
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,839
yeah yeah i'm brainwashed uh-huh we're

273
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:11,120
brainwashed

274
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:13,600

00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,800
it all away

278
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,839
just throw all their blood away oh don't

279
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,959
worry

280
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:25,120
my children can make new blood oh yeah

281
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:27,200
they're bones their bones can just keep

282
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:30,480
on producing more cbc

283
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:32,320
yeah so the doctor can yeah so they they

284
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,720

285
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:37,200
and take more and more and more

286
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,640
no it's not precious no my children's

287
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,440
blood is not precious

288
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,320
no not at all they can remove all they

289
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,959
want

290
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,839
uh-huh 14 20 vials of my children's

291
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,320
blood

292
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:50,320
it's not important no no they said it's

293
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,440
no big deal just give the child a little

294
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,920
juice

295
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,120
uh-huh they just said give my daughter a

296
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,440
cookie

297
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,480
yep give my daughter a cookie that's

298
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,720
what they said

299
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,320
and they took all this blood for some

300
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,839
reason i i guess their blood just

301
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,120
doesn't matter much it's not even

302
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:07,600
precious

303
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,959
nope ah they can just make new blood all

304
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,399
the time oh i accidentally hung up on

305
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,800
you are you there

306
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,800
you there

307
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,760
um anyway the system's broken it's

308
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,959
broken

309
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:23,120
broken broken broken back

310
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:25,519
okay when we walk around like it's not

311
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,200
broken it's perfect because science says

312
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,880
our st the system's not broken it's

313
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,000
actually perfect we're brainwashed we're

314
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,880
brainwashed

315
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,279
science says all right and we're we

316
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:37,040
don't think the system's broken right

317
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:38,480
meanwhile science doesn't know why

318
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,079
anybody's sick

319
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,519
they just don't know why anybody's sick

320
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:44,079
fibromyalgia they don't know why

321
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,600
they think it's overactive nerves right

322
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,120
it's chronic fatigue syndrome they don't

323
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,720
know why they never did

324
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,320
okay multiple sclerosis they still don't

325
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,079
know why unless they take

326
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,600
medical medium information and publish

327
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:57,120
it which they've done

328
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:59,360
but signs of research in a on a whole

329
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,320
doesn't know what what's going on they

330
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,160
think it's your genes

331
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,760
your body attacking itself or it's maybe

332
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,079
hormones maybe

333
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,959
they don't know why anybody's sick right

334
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:10,959
so

335
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:12,320
it's kind of the system's so broken

336
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:14,320
and the only way you're gonna even know

337
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,560
this is if you've been sick but i get it

338
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:19,200
i get it i get it i get it

339
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,079
i get it if you don't know you're sick

340
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,640
right

341
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,760
you know then then you know here's

342
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,440
another thing too this is really

343
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,360
important to know you'll see people out

344
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,000
there they're not really sick

345
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,600
they got little things real little

346
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,560
things and that's fine that's great

347
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,200
right

348
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,560
little things wrong and they go to their

349
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,320
doctor and everything and they think

350
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,880
they just got it all under control

351
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,240
because

352
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,399
they're getting rid of some processed

353
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,959
food they're taking a few

354
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,959
pills a few different things they're

355
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:49,920
taking a couple of supplements

356
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:50,959
and they think that they think they got

357
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,480
it going down

358
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:54,880
right they're okay they got it in

359
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:57,440
control and they haven't those

360
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:59,440
people i notice they're just sold on

361
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:02,480
anything science says they're also sold

362
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:04,160
on just you know they're sold on the

363
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,519
balance or moderation thing

364
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,600
they're sold on a lot of different

365
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,920
theories right but the point is is until

366
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,200
you

367
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:12,800
get that you cross that line and you're

368
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,360
really sick

369
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:17,519
and you're really sick and you're like

370
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,079
okay now i'm not functioning

371
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:22,399
my anxiety's crippling you know my pain

372
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:24,560
in my body's hurting really bad

373
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,880
now i'm in a place where oh my god this

374
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:30,240
is so difficult what do i do

375
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,880
then you realize that science doesn't

376
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,480
have it down

377
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,480
you got to go searching now and then

378
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,040
you're not as now you're at a specialist

379
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,079
and now

380
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:39,519
you find out the system is so broken you

381
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:43,440
end up on the doorstep of a

382
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:46,560
mthfrg mutation doctor or a lyme doctor

383
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,639
if if if if a doctor is totally into

384
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,680
mthfr gene mutation you're going to get

385
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,240
that label boom

386
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,760
mthfr gene mutation right here here's

387
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,279
the factory let's put it on your back

388
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,600
right

389
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,720
and if you go to a lime doctor boom lime

390
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,399
stamp on your back

391
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,720
there you go out the door you got lyme

392
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:04,880
disease that's how it's done right

393
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,120
or if you go to an ms doctor it's like

394
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,800
boom it's ms multiple sclerosis

395
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,959
that's your tag you get on your back

396
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,399
right and you might get

397
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:14,160
a combination of you might get a

398
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,880
doctor's like well could these multiple

399
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,320
sclerosis

400
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,680
hmm it could be could be lyme disease

401
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,200
we're going to take check all that out

402
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:24,240
could be oh you also have the

403
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,519
mthfr g mutation too and you get wrapped

404
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,480
up into this

405
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:30,320
still no answers but you kind of leave

406
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,440
thinking you got some answers like

407
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,519
you're getting you're getting a car

408
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,839
you're leaving your doctor's office like

409
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,360
yeah i think i got some answers they're

410
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,720
checking for lyme disease

411
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,560
that's what they're doing they're

412
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,760
checking for lyme i kind of feel

413
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,839
comfortable with that

414
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,519
i think i got lyme disease that's an

415
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,920
answer i finally got an

416
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:49,680
answer here i'm comfortable with mtf

417
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,360
mthfr gene mutation

418
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,959
i think i finally got an answer to why

419
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,720
i'm fatigued and i'm bloated and don't

420
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:57,760
feel good and i got heart palpitations

421
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,279
and i got anxiety yeah yeah it's mthfr

422
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,040
gene mutation that's what it is

423
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:02,399
i'm comfortable i'm leaving the doctor's

424
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,680
office i'm driving right

425
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:07,600
or hey no oh my god i think it could be

426
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,959
multiple sclerosis symptoms but at least

427
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,639
i got an answer to why i got the

428
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:11,360
numbness on the side of my body and the

429
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,199
tingles

430
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,160
and and then all the fatigue and aches

431
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:20,320
and pains and it's supposed to be like

432
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:24,959
you get this answer but the answer

433
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:27,040
in the end means nothing means nothing

434
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:29,040
because you're scammed left and right

435
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:32,720
and this scamming

436
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:33,760
is is it's incidious it's it's actually

437
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,959
like incredulous

438
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:40,000
it's the scamming is such a

439
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:41,600
such a smoking mirror and

440
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,519
that's that's what's going on out there

441
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,480
you know mthfr gene mutation is

442
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,839
epstein-barr

443
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,519
i'm just going to tell you right now

444
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:49,199
i've seen bar releases all of this

445
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:51,440
poison in your liver right

446
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:52,320
this is mthfrg mutation if you really

447
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:56,320
want to know okay

448
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:59,440
and i wrote this in the books right and

449
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:01,199
that's your liver that's the epstein bar

450
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,519
the epson bar hides out in the liver

451
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:04,959
that's where it hides right

452
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:08,240
it hides out in the liver it's peaking

453
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:10,959
its head right there hey guys

454
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,160
got the epsilon bar right it likes to

455
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:14,320
hide inside your liver

456
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,839
okay i try to make learning fun you guys

457
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,320
bear with me right

458
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,519
and what it does is it builds up all of

459
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:24,079
this viral

460
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:28,160
toxin byproduct corpses

461
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:31,759
viral byproduct dead viruses

462
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:33,360
right viral casings that end up the

463
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:36,480
casings for what lime

464
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:39,040
lyme doctors believe are spirochetes

465
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,079
spirochetes the whole if you guys know

466
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,440
anything about lyme disease

467
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:46,880
right well they saw the spirochetes um

468
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:49,040
the doctors saw the spirochete somewhere

469
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,399
that's shell casings of the epstein-barr

470
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,959
virus

471
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:54,639
that's what that is right so the epstein

472
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:56,880
bar is behind

473
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:58,800
so many of these chronic conditions and

474
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,079
with mthfr gene mutation what the

475
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,959
epstein bar does

476
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:04,880
it releases all of this gunk and crap it

477
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:07,680
builds up in your liver

478
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:09,759
and then it puffs out of the liver puff

479
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:13,120
powder you ever step on that mushroom

480
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:15,519
that's like it's like uh

481
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,720
it's kind of like it looks like a circle

482
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,240
and it's on the ground

483
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,399
do you ever go into nature and you step

484
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,639
on it when you step on it it puffs

485
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,160
and what's puffing is all those spores

486
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:25,920
it's a type of it's a type of fungus

487
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:29,040
that grows on the ground right in nature

488
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:32,720
right and that's what happens your liver

489
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:36,079
puffs all of this viral toxin right

490
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:38,240
now you're going to doctor to doctor now

491
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:41,120
what that's junk does that comes out of

492
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:44,560
the liver from the epstein-barr virus

493
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:46,800
it raises your inflammatory markers

494
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:49,120
so it doesn't matter who you're at so

495
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:52,560
i'm going to head to the lyme doctor

496
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:55,920
the lyme guy well his lyme tests are

497
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:58,720
inflammatory markers there's no borrelia

498
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,680
he finds there's nobody bartonella they

499
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,000
don't find that

500
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,360
lyme lab i know i've talked to all kinds

501
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,439
of lab technicians in

502
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,480
lime labs and everywhere else right and

503
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,400
they even reached out to me and they

504
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,520
said how did you know we don't actually

505
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,319
have had lime

506
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,919
lab people reach out to me and say how

507
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:16,400
did you know

508
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:17,039
because it's private information how did

509
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,600
you know

510
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:21,199
that we don't see the bacteria we place

511
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:26,400
the bacteria's name

512
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:29,679
on the test we see elevated inflammation

513
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:32,400
and then since we're a lime lab we

514
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:33,360
put lyme bacteria what we think is

515
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,679
theoretically

516
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:38,080
right there okay now here's the other

517
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:40,480
thing mthfr gene mutation

518
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,919
they're not finding a mutated gene

519
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,320
doesn't that hurt

520
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:47,120
like why are they screwing us over then

521
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:48,880
like why isn't the doctor informed

522
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:52,080
because they they're just seeing

523
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:55,120
elevated inflammation

524
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:58,320
just from from the viral issue

525
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:59,760
from the viral issue right that's how

526
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,840
it's done so then you're leaving

527
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,120
the doctor's office you're driving home

528
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,520
and you got an answer

529
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,320
okay me and my kids all got mthfr gene

530
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,919
mutation

531
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,400
no you and your kids all got

532
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:12,320
epstein-barr

533
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,160
and maybe it won't matter then until you

534
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:16,720
guys get really sick like

535
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,360
really sick and then that's when it

536
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,600
matters

537
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:21,520
then it's like what the heck is going on

538
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,760
is my gene mutation out of control like

539
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,360
what's going on here

540
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,200
important to know all this is important

541
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,880
to know

542
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,559
giving you guys like i'm giving you guys

543
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,360
information that

544
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:34,799
if if if i opened up a school these

545
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,840
would be courses

546
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:37,120
and you'd be paying five thousand

547
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,640
dollars ten thousand dollars of course

548
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,760
but i don't do that i want it for i want

549
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,520
to give it to you for free

550
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,120
but i know that a lot of people once you

551
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,520
give everything for free

552
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:47,679
they kind of discard it because they

553
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:49,679
need to pay for something

554
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,960
it's interesting how the human i hear i

555
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,960
keep on hearing this they're like

556
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,480
aw why aren't you charging thousands of

557
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,559
dollars for the information

558
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,919
volumes you give out because then people

559
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:59,840
will take you know though maybe they'll

560
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:01,120
take it more serious i'm like no no no

561
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,280
don't insult

562
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,720
don't insult the people i'm helping

563
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,160
because they know how serious this

564
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,679
information is

565
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,440
and they don't need to pay ten thousand

566
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,160
dollars for a course to actually know

567
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,760
how serious

568
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:15,440
this is um anyway guys so

569
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,960
we're covering a lot of cool topics

570
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,400
right now and it kind of borderlines the

571
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,600
whole science sets

572
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:24,320
okay like science says

573
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:27,760
your genes are screwed up science says

574
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,760
your body's attacking itself

575
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:33,440
science says idiopathic

576
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,440
cause unknown and what i wrote in the

577
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,960
medical medium book one originally

578
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,440
basically science is trying to call you

579
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,120
an idiot you go there with your symptoms

580
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,039
and the reason why they did the

581
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:46,160
idiopathic thing

582
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:47,679
really is just because before they came

583
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,039
came up with the idiopathic thing with

584
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:50,160
all your aches and pains and tingles and

585
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:52,080
numbness and everything else

586
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,840
before you what they used to say what

587
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:57,039
they used to say is you're crazy

588
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:58,880
you know so

589
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:00,640
it's really it's really kind of what

590
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:03,679
they've always done but

591
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:05,760
this information is so it's so um it's

592
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:09,039
so incredibly important

593
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:10,960
so is is hemochromatosis real gene

594
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:12,080
real gene mutation just gas no it's not

595
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,559
it's viral

596
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:16,320
it's viral that's a viral issue right

597
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:17,840
see what they need to do is here's what

598
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,760
science is going to do science is going

599
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:22,320
to convince you

600
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:24,960
everyone eventually your genes are just

601
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:28,400
screwed up it protects science it's that

602
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:32,320
it's an incredible way to never

603
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:35,039
do science studies on things that matter

604
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,679
right because they can cast it all as

605
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:38,960
jeans

606
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:39,919
it's your genes that's it no we don't

607
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,400
need to take

608
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:43,679
500 billion dollars and put it into why

609
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,559
your children is

610
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:47,520
your child's really sick we don't need

611
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,919
to do that

612
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,679
we are going to take 500 billion because

613
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,799
we got all these grants from massive

614
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:54,640
corporations

615
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:57,600
we're going to take 500 billion dollars

616
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:59,919
and we're going to just study your genes

617
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,600
that's what they do i'm giving you

618
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:04,000
double meaning here

619
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:05,520
get ready for this double meaning

620
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,039
because all medical medium information

621
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,600
does have hidden double meanings in

622
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:11,600
there

623
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:14,240
right we're gonna get we're gonna ask

624
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:16,240
from big huge corporations so we don't

625
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,600
have to

626
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,080
and then we're going to take we're going

627
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:22,000
to ask them you give us 250 million

628
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:24,159
you give us another medical research we

629
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,960
want another 250 million

630
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:28,880
we want another 500 million from you and

631
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,440
then we're going to take our 500 billion

632
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,679
dollars

633
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,880
and instead of helping children really

634
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,720
helping moms

635
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,880
find out why they're fatigued why

636
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,960
children are sick with eczema

637
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:41,520
why people are suffering why children

638
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:44,880
have autism why children have adhd

639
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:46,559
why all these problems right instead of

640
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,039
solving any of them we're going to take

641
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:52,000
500 million dollar science

642
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:54,720
and we're going to study your genes and

643
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:58,240
it ain't for pretty reasons

644
00:21:54,720 --> 00:22:01,200
it's not for cute fluffy pretty

645
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,320
reasons and we're gonna study your genes

646
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,919
never tell you

647
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,520
never find out what's really wrong with

648
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:07,120
you but we're gonna tell you so we can

649
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,679
say next time you come to the doctor

650
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,559
we're gonna be

651
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:12,559
at your jeans and some of the tricks are

652
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:14,799
like the mthfr gene mutation

653
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:16,880
all the different genes genie fits your

654
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:20,240
jeans jeans jeans

655
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:21,360
look you don't have to you don't have to

656
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,559
like me

657
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:28,559
you don't have to like the way i look

658
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:31,840
you don't have to like the way i talk

659
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:32,640
right but keep an open mind on what i'm

660
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,360
saying

661
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,640
because this is really important

662
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,919
information

663
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,520
i'm going to make some spinach soup you

664
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:42,000
guys got a lot of stuff to talk about

665
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:45,120
that's medical medium new addition

666
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,440
um gene mutation tests

667
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:49,120
they don't even need that they don't

668
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:52,400
even need that

669
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:55,679
forensics forensics

670
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,320
okay like on a murder scene a murder

671
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,520
scene

672
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:02,640
forensics needs a 30-year

673
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:05,120
40 year old drop of blood on a pair of

674
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:08,400
jeans

675
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:11,679
okay desiccated blood

676
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:13,919
right a pin up

677
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:15,679
on the tip of a pin you couldn't even

678
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:18,720
see it on here

679
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:22,720
on somebody's genes 40 years ago

680
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:27,280
to determine dna and other things right

681
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:29,280
but they need 14 vials from your baby

682
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:31,440
to do a little gene mutation test and

683
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,760
some nutritional deficiency tests

684
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:36,720
and a little bit of cbc they'll take 14

685
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:39,600
vials from somebody's baby

686
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,000
it there's such a break in the system

687
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,640
it's

688
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,200
almost it's almost unbelievable you know

689
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,799
why we

690
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:48,320
don't you know why we don't understand

691
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:50,320
it

692
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:53,840
do you know why we don't get it or

693
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:56,880
understand it do you know why

694
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:58,400
we can't this

695
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,880
phone thing's really driving me crazy

696
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:04,080
now you guys

697
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:06,640
brainwashed huh

698
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,919
yeah yeah i'm brainwashed uh-huh yeah

699
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:11,360
they brainwashed me

700
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:14,559
uh-huh yeah they brainwa paddle

701
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:15,520
uh-huh i'm part of the paddle what's

702
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:18,720
paddle

703
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:22,159
that's people that are cattle hurting

704
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:24,960
to the brainwashing clinic sheeple

705
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:27,600
we're all sheeple then we just heard we

706
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:31,360
just heard to the

707
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:34,320
we heard to the brainwashing clinic yep

708
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:35,679
that's what we do uh-huh we're gonna be

709
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,760
taught that it's our genes

710
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:39,520
but they're gonna take 500 billion more

711
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,320
dollars and they're going to study our

712
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:44,240
genes

713
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:47,360
they're never going to tell us huh

714
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,480
yeah we're brainwashed uh-huh yeah i

715
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:52,559
believe them

716
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:54,480
i believe them where's your study uh-huh

717
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:56,400
yeah where's your study i did they

718
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,000
trained us to say where's your study

719
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,080
did you know that when i'm on social

720
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,520
media brainwashed when i'm on social

721
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:06,320
media i type in where's your study

722
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:09,360
when i'm on social media i type in

723
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:12,400
where's your science report

724
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:13,760
yeah we're brainwashed i'm sick i don't

725
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:17,360
feel good

726
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:19,600
the doctor says it's my genes uh-huh

727
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,640
they've done it 10 trillion dollars in

728
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,240
medical testing

729
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,679
out there in the world and they can't

730
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,039
even give you anything but it's your

731
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:27,279
genes

732
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:28,640
uh-huh but i think that's perfectly fine

733
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:30,960
because i'm brainwashed

734
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,000
i gotta go i'm gonna make some spinach

735
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,640
soup

736
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,640
make some spinach soup you guys uh

737
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,320
stephanie what about someone who has

738
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:41,360
high histamines

739
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:42,080
and a lot of free radicals what causes

740
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:45,600
all of this in

741
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:48,960
my blood test well first of all

742
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:52,240
that's dirty liver that's dirty liver

743
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:53,679
it's really simple dirty liver liver

744
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,080
stagnant and sluggish filled with lots

745
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:59,279
of different toxins that's what that is

746
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:00,320
histamines elevating means pathogen

747
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:03,679
toxins

748
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:07,600
streptococcus that's one of them um

749
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:10,240
viruses shingles epstein-barr cold sores

750
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,200
the cold sore virus hides out inside the

751
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,039
liver

752
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,320
it's in the liver when you see somebody

753
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:16,640
with a cold sore

754
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,520
you're all you have to you you can learn

755
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,799
right now

756
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:22,720
someone's got a cold sore that virus

757
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:24,720
doesn't just live where the cold sore

758
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,480
comes out in the moment right

759
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,080
where you can catch it you give them a

760
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,600
kiss and now you got it

761
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,039
it could come out a year later it can

762
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,360
come out a week later but now you got

763
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:33,840
the

764
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,799
the simplex one right that virus lives

765
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,799
inside the liver

766
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:38,240
if you see that on someone it's in the

767
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:39,760
liver and

768
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,360
same thing with shingles it's inside the

769
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:45,120
liver same thing with with

770
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:48,320
with any bug if you had the chicken pox

771
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:52,400
when you were a child the chickenpox

772
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:53,919
virus lives inside your liver they live

773
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,919
in there live in there live in there

774
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:57,520
build up all this toxic sludge toxic

775
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:57,840
sludge and then the sludge starts coming

776
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,440
out

777
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:01,840
if you got high histamines you'll end up

778
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,880
getting an mthfr gene mutation diagnosis

779
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:05,600
eventually too

780
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:08,080
because it's all the same thing it's all

781
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,360
that gunk coming out of the liver

782
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,200
then you gotta clean and learn how to

783
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,799
clean up the liver and lower the fat so

784
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,760
spinach soup is a great way to do it

785
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:18,240
let's go into that a little bit

786
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:19,279

794
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:36,880

795
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:40,080

or so but after after baby delivery my

798
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,960
herpes

799
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:50,080
moved now i have it on my face

800
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,600
or inside my nose very painful well what

801
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,279
happens is that

802
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,880
when i talk about this many times you

803
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:55,919
guys i've talked about this a lot of

804
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:59,039
times right

805
00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:00,240
um the

806
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:02,240
i was going to go grab something i don't

807
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,720
know what it is but it's okay i

808
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:07,760
the when when you when you're pregnant

809
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:09,919
your immune system drops by 50

810
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:13,200
that's what happens so when you're

811
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:16,240
pregnant your immune system drops by 50

812
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:18,960
for women men's immune system stays

813
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:21,440
always even keel they can burn it to the

814
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:24,240
ground but it burns to the ground

815
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:26,880
evenly it burns to the ground really

816
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:29,360
evenly is what it does right

817
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,720
little women but women's reproductive

818
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:33,919
systems

819
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,799
are different they require the immune

820
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:37,840
system to be

821
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:40,480
all there so when you're pregnant

822
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,200
50 of your immune system protects the

823
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,440
baby

824
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,399
when you're pregnant right when you're

825
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:47,840
having

826
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:49,679
a cycle okay your immune system protects

827
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:52,720
your reproductive system too

828
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:54,399
when you're delivering the baby 90

829
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:56,320
of your entire immune system goes to

830
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:59,520
protecting your baby during delivery

831
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:01,600
so then that simplex which your immune

832
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:04,960
system had under control

833
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:06,559
it had that simplex under control right

834
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,720
your immune system had it totally under

835
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:11,039
control and then

836
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,159
what happened was after being pregnant

837
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:15,200
for nine months

838
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:16,720
and 50 of your immune system continually

839
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,399
taking care of the baby

840
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,919
the immune system wasn't there to keep

841
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:23,279
the simplex

842
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:26,320
intact like in and keep it cool

843
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:28,080
keep it calm keep it in check right

844
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:30,080
and then you deliver the baby and now

845
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,919
the immune system drops because you need

846
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:34,640
all your adrenaline to deliver the baby

847
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:37,440
now your 90 immune system is taken to

848
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:40,880
the baby while your adrenals are pumping

849
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:42,559
after after childbirth you can

850
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,559
women get everything hashimoto's

851
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:46,080
thyroiditis from their epstein bars

852
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:48,240
they get heart palpitations they get

853
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:51,120
arrhythmias from their epstein bars

854
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:52,240
they get fatigue from their epstein bars

855
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,480
they get um

856
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,440
you know they get herpes cold sores on

857
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,480
their face

858
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:00,559
their nose right on their lips

859
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,919
from uh from what would they bend

860
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:03,520
through they get all these different

861
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:04,399
conditions it can happen when the immune

862
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,880
system

863
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:08,320
lowers like that so um but i talk about

864
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,919
and cleanse the heal all the protocols

865
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:13,200
in there you can take it to your doctor

866
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:13,200

company

879
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:46,000

everything

883
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,600
because i don't want them to stop making

884
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:53,279
this i just don't want them to stop

885
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,240

00:30:54,240 --> 00:31:00,480
it's a powerful tool and i don't like

888
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:00,880
i worry about losing these tools out

889
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,960
there

890
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:04,399

00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,880
thing i know i talked about it before

894
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:10,880
but anyway

895
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:18,080

900
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:30,559
the spinach soup

901
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:30,559
um i'm gonna start by putting in some

902
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:34,000
tomatoes

903
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,039
if you guys don't like tomatoes or you

904
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,640
know you got a tomato

905
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:38,880
like you're just afraid of them or

906
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,720
something like that you don't have to do

907
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:42,480

topics talking about

937
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:45,840

946
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:04,000
the spinach soup

00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:05,760
incredible so i'm gonna put some spinach

948
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,519
in here now

949
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:09,440
what i like to do is this is a smaller

950
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:12,000
blender blender it's not

951
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:14,159
it's not a real tall one so i'm gonna

952
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,360
add more spinach after i blend it up you

953
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:17,360
guys after i blend it up

954
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:21,120
you can do look you can steam spinach if

955
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,159
you really wanted to

956
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:26,159
i don't like it that i honestly i like

957
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:27,600
the raw spinach so healing for the

958
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:30,720
mineral salts

959
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:33,440
andrea when when i would eat raw soups

960
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:35,279
like this my acid reflux kicks up

961
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,559
is this liver and gallbladder being

962
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:39,760
sluggish

963
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:40,799
um first of all okay first for being

964
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:43,440
your own detective

965
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:44,960
one thing you want to do is make sure

966
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:48,000
were there any fats

967
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:49,200
in that raw soup were there avocado in

968
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,760
that raw soup

969
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:53,120
was there any oil in that raw soup first

970
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,240
of all i mean maybe there wasn't and

971
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,880
there wasn't any of that

972
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:58,720
okay andrea was there any nutritional

973
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,640
yeast in the diet was there any

974
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:02,320
vinegar apple cider vinegar in there a

975
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,440
lot of raw people they're just raw raw

976
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,960
and they're just doing apple cider

977
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,880
vinegar or whatever it is

978
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,960
make sure that's not going anywhere near

979
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:10,159
there so that's important all on its own

980
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,320
okay

981
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:14,399
and then what did you eat before the

982
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:16,079
spinach soup what did you have

983
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:17,679
during did you do the spinach soup or

984
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:19,599
dinner but you had a lot of

985
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:21,440
fat and you pushed your gallbladder to

986
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:23,280
the edge during the day

987
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,960
like did you have you know are you

988
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,560
plant-based and you had some nut butters

989
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,839
that day and then you had some avocado

990
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:31,359
that day and you had maybe

991
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:33,200
coconut oil that day um so that's that

992
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:35,359
all these things are important to know

993
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:36,960
and then how much spinach soup you know

994
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:39,119
sometimes you know you make a big bowl

995
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:41,040
of it and you send it down really quick

996
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:42,800
it's really a potent healing tool so you

997
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:45,200
kind of sip it and just kind of get

998
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:48,800
through and see how that's working too

999
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:50,639
it and acid reflux this is the only time

1000
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:53,919
you ever had acid reflux

1001
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:54,800
this is it this this is just it like no

1002
00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:56,960
acid reflux

1003
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,480
on anything you can eat all week do

1004
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,920
everything all week every day

1005
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,920
every day all week you're doing

1006
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:03,599
everything and no acid reflux and then

1007
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:05,359
the spinach soup did it

1008
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:07,599
so keep keep that in mind too you

1009
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:09,839
probably had some acid reflux

1010
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:11,920
constantly coming in and out of there so

1011
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:15,280
the spinach soup is a healing tool

1012
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:18,640
so now here's here's the next part

1013
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:20,800
this this starves bad bacteria

1014
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:22,480
so that's what this does so the medical

1015
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:26,160
means spinach soup

1016
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:28,880
starves bad bacteria

1017
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:30,079
so you know what that means but really

1018
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:33,440
starves them

1019
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:36,560
strips them down breaks them down

1020
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:37,040
okay so when you're and here's the other

1021
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:40,640
thing

1022
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:42,720
okay oh you got acid you got acid reflux

1023
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:44,800
all the time andrea

1024
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:47,440
so there's acid if you have acid reflux

1025
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:49,920
you got the low hydrochloric acid

1026
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:51,200
you got that going on right so there's

1027
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,119
the low hcl

1028
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,320
got some bacteria going i tell people

1029
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:55,440
all the time i talk to doctors about

1030
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:57,680
this all the time too

1031
00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:00,480
their patients they have this they have

1032
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:02,720
the elevated bacteria in their gut right

1033
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:04,320
and that's producing acid then they got

1034
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:05,839
the stagnant sluggish liver that's

1035
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,680
spewing out stuff

1036
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:09,040
then the gallbladder spewing out all

1037
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,720
kinds of stuff too

1038
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:12,640
and the spinach soup's like the cleaner

1039
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:14,400
upper it gets in there man it is

1040
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:16,000
cleaning all this stuff up

1041
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,520
i mean it's a healing tool that's doing

1042
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,640
all this cleaning so that's

1043
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:24,880
that happens right there um

1044
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:27,119
let's put some orange in here okay

1045
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:28,400

right but what is it going on like so if

1101
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:17,599
if it's not something happening when you

if it was me i'd still be doing it

1106
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,000
because

1107
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:29,359
food sensitivity tests don't don't

1108
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,119
really give the full picture about

1109
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:32,720
really what's happening inside the body

1110
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:35,760
and here's the thing this is important

1111
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:39,280
too this is really important right here

1112
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:41,440

for 40 years people just stayed sick

1255
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:44,319

1256
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,280

with fibro stayed sick with multiple

1260
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:51,760
sclerosis that's what people did

1261
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:54,079
before medical medium information came

1262
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:55,359

getting people better

1265
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:00,880
but when it really came to town millions

1266
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:03,119
more millions around the world healed

1267
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:05,920
but the point is is i'm not trying to

1268
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:09,200

1269
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:10,800

1270
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:13,040

1277
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:41,280
i'm going to add some more spinach in

1278
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:41,280
here

1279
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:50,880
lauren says julie joseph i follow

1280
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:51,200
medical medium and everything he says to

1281
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:53,920
do

1282
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:54,720
but recently my organic assets test

1283
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:57,920
showed

1284
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:59,760
oxalates getting high causing pain

1285
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:01,440
so first of all the oxalate thing and

1286
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,079
look i want you to listen to your doctor

1287
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:04,560
lauren

1288

1289
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:07,680

your doctor okay

1292
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:13,920
but i'll tell you what i teach doctors

1293
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:17,440
the old oxalate game isn't why anybody

1294
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,880
was sick

1295
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:20,000
people played with oxalates till the

1296
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:21,599
blue they were blue in the face and

1297
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:24,160
never got rid of their fibro or anything

1298
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:26,640
else oxalates is also a theory

1299
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:29,839
science research hasn't even actually

1300
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:32,000
proven oxalates is an issue

1301
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:33,760
so your doctor is not even working with

1302
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,920
something that was proven yet

1303
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:37,200
so okay is your doctor making up the

1304
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,800
oxalates thing

1305
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:40,880
because if he is you're talking to

1306
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:43,119
somebody that's making stuff up right

1307
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:44,480
so because oxalates can't be proven

1308
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:46,720
science research never found

1309
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:48,079
oxalates in the body causing any problem

1310
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:49,599
there's never been anything that ever

1311
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:52,800
showed that right

1312
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:54,400
but and here's how oxalates work

1313
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:56,160
people go on the oxalate train and they

1314
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:59,280
go searching for oxalates

1315
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:00,720
and people don't realize you can call it

1316
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:02,079
oxalates you can call it anything you

1317
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:03,040
want but what else is happening in your

1318
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:04,400
life

1319
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:05,680
what else are you doing are you doing

1320
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:08,000
nutritional yeast are you doing apple

1321
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:09,839
cider vinegar are you doing any caffeine

1322
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,359
or did you have chocolate two weeks ago

1323
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:13,760
because that causes body pain

1324
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:15,119
caffeine so there's there's all these

1325
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:16,720
things that people do

1326
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:18,400
and so i want you to be your own

1327
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:19,839
detective right i want you to listen to

1328
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,800
everything your doctor says lauren i

1329
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:22,400
want you to listen everything your

1330
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:24,480
doctor says your doctor says oxalates

1331
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:25,760
you go with the oxalates okay

1332
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:27,280
but i want you to be your own detective

1333
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:28,000
too and i want everybody to be on their

1334
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:31,200
own detective right

1335
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:34,800
now was there a new medical treatment

1336
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:37,760
someone might have done was there

1337
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:38,319
antibiotics someone might have taken

1338
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:40,480
back

1339
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:42,400
six months ago because six months later

1340
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:43,760
you can get an activation of all kinds

1341
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:45,359
of problems from antibiotics you've

1342
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:48,240
taken six months before

1343
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:50,240
was there nutritional yeast in your diet

1344
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:51,520
somewhere msg it builds up it builds up

1345
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,560
and builds up and then boom you've got

1346
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:54,640
body pain

1347
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:56,160
was there apple cider vinegar which

1348
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:56,800
pickles the liver pickles the liver

1349
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,240
breaks down

1350
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:00,160
the stomach glands cause problems and

1351
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:03,760
then boom you get pushed over

1352
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:06,319
was there anything else happening too

1353
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:07,920
was there high fat this medical medium

1354
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:09,040
doesn't recommend high fat if you're if

1355
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:11,040
you're trying to heal

1356
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:12,319
was there high fat in the diet how much

1357
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:14,319
avocado oils

1358
00:47:12,319 --> 00:47:15,520
almond butter are you doing how much of

1359
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:18,640
all that are you doing

1360
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:20,559
was there a new pathogen infection

1361
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:21,920
that someone could have caught i'm

1362
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:24,559
giving you guys all this stuff so you'd

1363
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:27,680
be all your own detective right

1364
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:31,760
are you looking at everything before you

1365
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:35,359
go and hop on the oh it's my lectins

1366
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:38,720
that i'm eating oh it's oxalates oh

1367
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:41,119
was there a blood dross apparently if a

1368
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:44,160
doctor's looking at your oxalates

1369
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:45,839
the doctor must be taking some blood how

1370
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,960
much blood has the doctor been taking in

1371
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:48,800
the last year

1372
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:51,440
because if you're getting blood draws

1373
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:52,000
five vials seven vials four full vials

1374
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:54,880
eight full

1375
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:56,160
vials it adds up ten full vials your

1376
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:58,400
immune system drops

1377
00:47:56,160 --> 00:48:01,040
then all of a sudden you get boom thrown

1378
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:04,559
into body pain later right

1379
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:07,440
and i'm not saying you know look

1380
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:09,440
i'm not saying hey don't believe your

1381
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:10,960
doctor you believe your doctor you do

1382
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:13,040
what your doctor says

1383
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:14,880
that's what i say do what your doctor

1384
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:16,160
says you listen to your doctor right if

1385
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:18,960
it was me

1386
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:20,079
i'd be like what else is going on okay

1387
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:23,040
the doctor just

1388
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:23,520
three weeks ago took eight vials from me

1389
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:26,880
what

1390
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:29,040
i had eight vials taken six months ago

1391
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:30,559
uh that's my immune system going out the

1392
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:32,800
window um

1393
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:34,640
i did eat some chocolate which has

1394
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:36,400
caffeine in it which is really bad when

1395
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:37,760
anybody's got any kind of pathogens or

1396
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:41,200
any kind of other problems

1397
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:42,480
i did have chocolate hmm yeah but i am

1398
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:43,920
saying i'm doing everything medical

1399
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:46,240
medium says

1400
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:48,000
um but medical medium doesn't say

1401
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:49,839
chocolate or in these other things he

1402
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,440
also tells you don't get the blood draws

1403
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:52,880
get ask your doctor to do something

1404
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:54,960
different on the medical mean podcast

1405
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:57,119
apple podcast all that information

1406
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:59,280
but i want you to be your own detectives

1407
00:48:57,119 --> 00:49:00,960
out there like what else is happening

1408
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:02,880
did you have some matcha tea that

1409
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:03,680
caffeine will blow out your nervous

1410
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:06,000
system

1411
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:07,440
even if it's weeks later like what's

1412
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,680
going on

1413
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:11,359
and was there a new medical treatment at

1414
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:12,960
all was there an older medical

1415
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:14,960
treatment that happened a little while

1416
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:17,119
back was there

1417
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:18,960
um was there hot is the high fat going

1418
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:20,319
on because medical medium knows that

1419
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:21,920
when you're healing

1420
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:23,680
if you do the high fats you're going to

1421
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:25,760
eventually get yourself sick right you

1422
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:27,760
got to learn how to lower the fats right

1423
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:28,880
and what kind of supplements is the

1424
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:30,720
person using too

1425
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:32,240
is there alcohol in them is there is

1426
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:33,920
there citric acid in them

1427
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:36,079
is there other things in there there and

1428
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:37,599
all that and do they know the protocols

1429
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:40,079
they're taking right

1430
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:41,599
but so it's important to know that

1431
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:42,800
there's a lot of tools to get better

1432
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:45,200
with medical medium

1433
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:46,319
it's not it's not it's not

1434
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:48,960
straightforward like

1435
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:50,240
i've been doing medical medium i've done

1436
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:52,720
all medical medium

1437
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:54,240
really because when you really do

1438
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:56,480
medical medium

1439
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:58,400
you really do it you're a deep in the

1440
00:49:56,480 --> 00:50:00,000
