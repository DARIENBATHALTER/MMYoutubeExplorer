1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,480
about supplemental protocols medical

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:06,640
medium supplement protocols

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,800
this is an important live right here for

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:11,280
a lot of reasons because people

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,040
often get confused when it comes down to

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,880
supplementation when it comes down to

7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,840
medical medium protocols

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,840
because there's so much information with

9
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,080
medical medium there's so much

10
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,840
leading information in the health world

11
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,400
that it's it is true

12
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,439
it's hard to keep track of it because

13
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,920
it's geared

14
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,720
so someone can go as far as they want to

15
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,960

16
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,760
someone who's actually critically sick

17
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,399
or someone

18
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,000
who's not so sick who wants to improve

19
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,040
and heal and you know and get better

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,399
really quick right

21
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:46,480
so it's not just one

22
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:48,399
size fits all like all the other stuff

23
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,239

some of this that will fix everything

28
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,680
and you know and medical media protocol

29
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,640
is is

30
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:09,360
protocols are thousands of protocols

31
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:11,439
customizing it to yourself so you can

32
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,640
make it to the finish line

33
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,159
and there's something really special

34
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,159
about that you might be somebody that's

35
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,840
just hey you're doing celery juice

36
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,479
16 ounces on an empty stomach every

37
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:23,040
single day you're building up your hcl

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,200
right and then you might be somebody

43
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,040
that's

44
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,640
doing a whole bunch of different

45
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,640
supplementation dosages

46
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,000
knowing how to do supplement dosages

47
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,360
you're doing your celery juice you're

48
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,720
doing cleanses you might be somebody

49
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,159
who's doing the mono cleanse

50
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:46,640
or the 369 but

51
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,799
take comfort in something that there's

52
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,200
something in there for you

53
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,439
and where you are with your health and

54
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,560
what's happening with your health

55
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:57,439
and if and there's different levels of

56
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,040
conditions

57
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:01,040
here's one thing that confuses people a

58
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,840
lot you guys okay

59
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,360
somebody with bloating may just have a

60
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,239
little bit of bloating

61
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,759
maybe some mild acne and they do medical

62
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,920
medium protocol

63
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:14,160
and they get better and then they tell

64
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,319
somebody else what bloating

65
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,400
that all you needed is to do is just

66
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,879
this and then someone else

67
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,080
tries a little bit of that and they

68
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,959
don't get rid of their bloating

69
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,760
because they were more severe they were

70
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,400
more severe

71
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,080
so that someone else has to actually get

72
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,879
into the book

73
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:35,200
and learn how to use it in the protocol

74
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:37,360
so they can get their severe bloating

75
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,560

76
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,760

love about cleansed heel and one thing i

301
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:38,959
love about medical medium information

302
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,959
is cold and flu information

303
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:46,000
and pandemic too so plague

304
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,640
because basically that's that's the flu

305
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,880
it's just

306
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:52,959
a different kind of engineered flu so

307
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,560
medical medium books or are for a lot of

308
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,399
that too and i'll go into the cold and

309
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,720
flu section which is important

310
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:01,600
so that's a great place place to go so

311
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:05,440
let's start

312
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,440
where to start when it comes down to

313
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,240
i'm going to find the page right now

314
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:15,040
julie says where does a sick child liver

315
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,680
come from is it genetic

316
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,680
no it's not genetic toxic heavy metals

317
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:22,160
are passed

318
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:24,079
in utero so that's one reason right

319
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,040
there low-grade viruses are passed in

320
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:27,440
utero

321
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,360
that's another reason right there and

322
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:32,720
then also a child can

323
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:34,640
get and pick up and contract strep also

324
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,399
get strep from the parents strap from

325
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:39,040
other sources

326
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:40,160
that's it that's a easy prime example of

327
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,920
how it's done

328
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,200
and other ways too those are just that's

329
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:47,279
just a couple of things

330
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:49,279
not to mention toxins lots of toxins

331
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:51,360
children get lots of toxins for lots of

332
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:53,519
reasons

333
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,519
so if you're dealing with more than one

334
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:58,079

335
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,519

thing in the moment

374
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,720

00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,000
another

395
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,519
you've had a lot of bad supplements

that in the list

403
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:32,079

there i tried meditation with my anxiety

473
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:57,199
it just doesn't work

474
00:16:53,759 --> 00:17:00,160

is really really bad

477
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,839
so i got the medical medium book i

478
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:10,480
decided to finally do it

479
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:12,880
i heard about it for years right

480
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,400
so i'm doing it and i'm seeing here when

481
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,880
anxiety interferes in your life yeah it

482
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:19,919
interferes with my life it's killing me

483
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:21,679
it's interfering with my life it's

484
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,679
caused by toxic heavy metals such as

485
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:26,240
mercury aluminum and copper

486
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:27,679
viruses such as one of the over 60

487
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,960
various epstein-barr you know i remember

488
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:33,840
having mono when i was younger

489
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:36,720
is that epstein-barr because i remember

490
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:38,559
having mono when i was younger

491
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:41,039
it could even be over one of the old the

492
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:43,200
one of the over 30 varieties of shingles

493
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:44,480
that's funny i had a strange rash about

494
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,840
seven years ago i didn't know what it

495
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,840
was a doctor wasn't sure what it was

496
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:52,160
or a combination of both toxic heavy

497
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:54,880
metals and viruses so i can have

498
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,720
metal causing my anxiety and maybe even

499
00:17:54,880 --> 00:18:00,720
viral issues

500
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:02,799
whoa most of the time it's both at once

501
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,080
with one cause more dominant depending

502
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:06,080
on individual case

503
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:08,799
that means i might have more toxic heavy

504
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:11,120
metals than i do viruses

505
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:12,480
check that out so here i am i already

506
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:16,080
been to 10 doctors

507
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:17,679
i got crippling anxiety i'm on benzos

508
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,120
and i'm actually learning right now for

509
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,640
the first time i'm getting an answer of

510
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,600
why i have crippling anxiety that's

511
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,600
interfering with my life

512
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:29,679
fancy that fancy that

513
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:32,160
seaweed hero fancy that might be a song

514
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:34,799
with that in there

515
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,880
anxiety okay so here's it most of the

516
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:40,960
times both at once right

517
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:43,120
with one dominating anxiety can also be

518
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,400
triggered accelerated or heightened by

519
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:47,760
emotional conflict

520
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:50,320
emotional conflict can heighten anxiety

521
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:52,320
okay we know that your anxiety might

522
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:55,440
crank up if you're triggered

523
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:58,240
emotionally ready although

524
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,840
toxic heavy metals and or virus must be

525
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:03,120
present for the anxiety to become

526
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,120
sustained and chronic

527
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,880
for the anxiety to be sustained and

528
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,280
chronic

529
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,640
it means it's these other physical

530
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,000
things

531
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,160
you know what's amazing about medical

532
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,160
mean information and i'm not saying this

533
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:20,400
because on the medical medium that's not

534
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:22,720
it because i'm just as astonished

535
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,400
as a lot of people are when they find

536
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:27,919
the true cause because

537
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:29,679
i'm a human being that hears the voice

538
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,240
the spirit of compassion since i was age

539
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:31,840
four

540
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,760
giving me the answers that nobody in

541
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,120
medicine could provide and nobody an

542
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,960
alternative alternative medicine can

543
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:39,360
provide ever

544
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,200
so i get blown away too and i don't take

545
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,640
it for granted i still wake up every

546
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:46,480
morning saying

547
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,480
it's incredible that you have the answer

548
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:51,039
it's incredible when it's not out there

549
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:56,240
let's go let's talk about anxiousness

550
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:58,640
you guys anxiousness that comes and goes

551
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,280
in a milder form can have the same toxic

552
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,840
metal or

553
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:04,000
viral causes or can result from mild

554
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:07,200
emotional injury or prolonged stress

555
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,440
on its own so i'm in anxiety for the

556
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,960
moment and that's a neurological symptom

557
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,280
and i want it to cover neurological

558
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:16,640
symptoms and we're going to go into

559
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:18,480
autoimmune as well in a little bit so

560
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,159

590
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:47,440

592
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:54,400
and experience it i use this every day

593
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,679
because i'm on this intense intense

594
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,440
schedule right now

595
00:21:55,679 --> 00:22:00,480

596
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:04,720

00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:19,520
there it says one capsule daily

602
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:24,000
now you can do less

603
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:27,039
you can do five mthf one every other day

604
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,400
you can try different options

605
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:30,480
here's something interesting then it

606
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:33,039
goes into aloe vera

607
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,760
two or more inches of fresh gel skin

608
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:36,720
removed

609
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,720
how do you like that

610
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:43,120
is there anything on lupus lupus is is

611
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:47,760
autoimmune so if you don't find it here

612
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:52,080
directly this has lupus in it right here

613
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:54,240
okay but lupus is under autoimmune here

614
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:56,720
so yeah so it says autoimmune diseases

615
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,880
and disorders

616
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:01,280
that's if you don't find your label

617
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:04,400
because there's hundreds of autoimmune

618
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:06,000
disease titles right

619
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:09,840
if you don't find it you go under

620
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,840
autoimmune autoimmune disorders

621
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:13,200

639
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:54,720
information

640
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:56,240

642
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:01,120
not care

643
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,880
if you ever get sick someday this stuff

644
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:05,520

645
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:07,520

00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,240
godsend so i'm cutting a piece of aloe

647
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:11,039
right there

648
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:12,480
so what does it say in the book so i'm

649
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:15,120
in anxiety

650
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,600
aloe vera two or more inches of fresh

651
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,799
gel

652
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:22,320
skin removed daily

653
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:22,320
so that's the aloe piece right there

654
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:34,799
right

655
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,000
here's a tip i might give you right here

656
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:39,360
which is really cool why

657
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,360
would aloe even be in here

658
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:49,520
a lot of people's nerves are jacked up

659
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:52,880
they're jacked up bad vagus nerves

660
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:55,200
attaching to the intestinal tract

661
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,720
are heightened in sensitivity because of

662
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,600
toxic heavy metals

663
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:01,120
and virus infections people walk around

664
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,480
with chronic viral infections every

665
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,240
single day and don't even know it and

666
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,520
they got crippling anxiety because of it

667
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:09,039
because of neurotoxins

668
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:09,039
created by the virus

669
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,760
so people walk around little bugs in

670
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:19,120
them is what they do

671
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:21,600
okay and those little bugs

672
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:23,520
pee and poo and they pee and poo

673
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,200
neurotoxins those neurotoxins get

674
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:28,320
released out of the viruses

675
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:32,240
like epstein-barr and shingles

676
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,240
those neurotoxins float around

677
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:42,080
and aggravate vagus nerve cells

678
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:45,360
any kind of vagus nerve issues so

679
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:47,679
what i like about aloe

680
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,559
and we just had a a piece of a two inch

681
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,919
piece right

682
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:54,640
maybe that's a little bit more than two

683
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:54,640
inches right there it's in the anxiety

684
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:59,200
section

685
00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:00,720
because it's soothing to the linings of

686
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,400
the intestinal tract

687
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:05,039
it's antiviral but it's soothing to the

688
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:08,480
linings of the intestinal tract

689
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:10,640
which can calm the nerves and calm the

690
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,480
vagus nerve down ease

691
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,679
gastric cramping and spasms and

692
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,600
everything

693
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:17,840
so that's why it's there in the anxiety

694
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,840
part

695
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:23,520
i remember when i was younger and spirit

696
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:26,159
of compassion would always give me

697
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:28,159
the remedies and the information that

698
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:29,440
people needed i would always ask like

699
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:33,279
why

700
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:37,760
why why all the time

701
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:40,000
you know why spirit why why why

702
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:41,679
so we did the aloe right there next one

703
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:46,320

750
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:36,480
why ashwagandha for anxiety i don't get

751
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:42,159
that like i

752
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:42,159
i want to know okay so let's go there

753
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:49,840
that's why when you get the low-grade

754
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:51,039
viral infections

755
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,240
this important information when you've

756
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:55,279
got the low-grade vital infections in

757
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:57,039
the toxic heavy metals

758
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:58,559
and it's triggering off that vagus nerve

759
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:00,240
and it's triggering off those those

760
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,880
those cranial nerves and it's messing

761
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,559
you up

762
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,000
and you're getting the tightness of the

763
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:05,360
chest and the tightness of the throat

764
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,399
and you're getting all the issues that

765
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,760
are involved in you know you're getting

766
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:09,279
the heart palpitations and all this

767
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,159
other stuff that's happening vegas nerve

768
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:11,520
related

769
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:13,520
doctor doesn't know why you're having

770
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:17,360
this the adrenals are

771
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:18,960
pumping pumping sometimes that anxiety

772
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,640
can keep you up half the night sometimes

773
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,480
it can keep you up the whole night

774
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:27,840
some sometimes it keeps people up three

775
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:27,840
days straight

776
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:34,159
donna says ashwagandha unless you are

777
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:38,640
hyperthyroid correct

778
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:38,640
not correct it's a theory

779
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:43,039
here's here's my problem that i have out

780
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,799
there the theories when theories develop

781
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:46,240
in natural medicine

782
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:48,080
they're developing when they still don't

783
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:50,000
know why someone has hyperthyroid or

784
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,360
hypothyroid but do what your doctor

785
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,480
tells you if your doctor tells you stay

786
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,159
away from ashwagandha because the

787
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:56,320
hypothyroid stay away from it

788
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:57,679
to listen to your doctor but what

789
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:00,799
happens is that

790
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:02,320
theories that develop in natural

791
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,919
medicine

792
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,760
from people who don't know why someone

793
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:07,679
has a hypothyroid hypothyroid

794
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,520
hashimoto's thyroiditis cyst nodules

795
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:11,600
tumors and their thyroid problem

796
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:13,120
they don't know why they didn't know it

797
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:15,440
was epstein-barr

798
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:17,039
that information came later science

799
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,679
researcher linking epstein-barr down

800
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:19,279
because

801
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:22,159
medical media published it many years

802
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:24,000
ago talked about it for many years but

803
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:26,320
the cause of hyperthyroidism and

804
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,520
hypothyroidism you'll read in the books

805
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:31,279
is epstein-barr virus which can also amp

806
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:36,320
up anxiety for a lot of people too

807
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:38,000
without having a thyroid problem

808
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:39,360
moving right along our adrenals get

809
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,640
jacked up that's why

810
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:44,559
the ashwagandha so spirit why is this

811
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,080
so when i'm taking down the information

812
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:47,760
and and getting it out there for

813
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,840
everybody

814
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:52,320
i'm asking questions all the time i want

815
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,320
to know

816
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:57,039
because it helps to protect the adrenals

817
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:58,720
when your anxiety is cranking

818
00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:00,559
rita gene says can you take a lot of the

819

take them at different times of the day

821
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:07,360
i take them all together a lot of times

822
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:09,360

861
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:54,159
so i'm just anxiety right now anxiety is

862
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:54,159
a neurological symptom

863
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,720
we're going to talk about other stuff

864
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:58,720
too while we're here

865
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:03,519
so moving on down the line there's a lot

866
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:05,679
of supplements here one of the

867
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:06,640
best ones for this problem that people

868
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:09,519
deal with is

869
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:10,000
lemon balm so that's one of the better

870
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:12,960
ones right

871
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
there is lemon balm so it says lemon

872
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:17,840
balm

873
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:21,760
four dropper fulls four times a day

874
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:21,760
four dropper fulls four times a day

875
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:27,840
right

876
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:38,000
so let me get these four dropper fulls

877
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:41,039
right in here

878
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:43,679
four dropper fulls four times a day

879
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:45,519
you don't have to do that dosage because

880
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:47,279
if you read in here you can do

881
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:49,760
less just like i was talking about

882
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:51,840
before so if i go back

883
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,799
you guys just got here if i go back in

884
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:56,960
here

885
00:33:52,799 --> 00:34:00,159
right if you're sensitive you can try

886
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,159
one supplement a day

887
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:08,720
vimrji supplements have flax oil in it

888
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,000
on tick tock you're saying no they don't

889
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:12,800
have flax oil in it

890
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,919
nope it's flax glycerin doesn't have

891
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,960
flax oil in it

892
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:19,599
just so you know it's advanced this flax

893
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:21,119
glycerin instead of palm glycerin

894
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:23,440
palm glycerin isn't the worst thing in

895
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:25,599
the world but it's not great

896
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:27,520
so vimergy has flax glycerin which

897
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:29,280
supersedes that's how advanced they are

898
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,800
it's incredible

899
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,480
you don't have flax oil in there that

900
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,159
flax glycerin though so there's no oil

901
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:36,399
in there

902
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:37,200
it's a good question though thanks for

903
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:40,560

904
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,879
so what i love about the lemon balm is

905
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,919
it

906
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:45,440
calms the nerves down is what it does it

907
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:46,639

but it calms the nerves is what it does

936
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:57,920
because phytochemical compounds

937
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:59,599
alkaloids and lemon bombs specifically

938
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:02,640
coat nerves

939
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:05,040
and stop them from wigging out

940
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:08,240
lemon balms also antibacterial antiviral

941
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:11,520
and that's a big deal too all on its own

942
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:13,760
so what's wigging out in our body

943
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,640
cranial nerves trigeminal nerve vagus

944
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,560
nerve right

945
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:18,640
all the different nerves in our body wig

946
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:20,079
out and

947
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:22,720
they're attached to all the different

948
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:25,280
organs too vagus nerve goes to some

949
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:27,040
lung lung activity vagus nerve goes to

950
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:29,760
the heart

951
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:31,760
vegas there goes the intestinal tract to

952
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,520
the stomach

953
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:36,240
and then people have all this anxiety or

954
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:39,280
symptoms that are neurological not just

955
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:42,320
anxiety and i love the lemon bomb

956
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:44,880
such a great great tool

957
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:46,160
okay if you grab lemon balm with alcohol

958
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:50,079
you're losing

959
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:51,680
you're losing you can't just burn the

960
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:53,520
alcohol off like people say well i'll

961
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,480
just burn the alcohol off i'll just boil

962
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,640
it

963
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:58,160
then yeah you're left over with now you

964
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:00,400
just boiled

965
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:02,480
something that was had a potential of

966
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:06,079
maybe helping inside the body but

967
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:07,280
but yet you're also boiling the heck out

968
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:09,920
of it

969
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:11,760
dispersing it in water like there's

970
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,040
there's no way out when you have alcohol

971
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,160
in the supplements it makes things

972
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,599
really difficult because a lot of people

973
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,440
will say no wait a minute

974
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:18,880
i got one it's got alcohol in it but i

975
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:23,359
know the trick you you

976
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:27,440
dump it into a pot of water and

977
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:27,440
and burn it off i'm like oh my god

978
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:31,280
and the alcohol already got into the

979
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:33,760
herb itself

980
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:35,599
so it's not about burning it off so what

981
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:38,960
i love about the vimergy is

982
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:42,079
there's no concern of that but yet

983
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:45,359
it's the flax glycerin

984
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:47,680
so it's even better than if you've

985
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:50,000
got another alcohol-free supplement that

986
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:51,920
had palm glycerin

987
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,599
and there's a lot of other reasons too

988
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:56,480
but that that's why it's good so

989
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:58,800
the vagus nerve runs into the different

990
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:01,359
organs

991
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:02,839
and the lemon bomb is helpful i can't

992
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:04,400
tell you how many people got off their

993
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:08,240
benzos

994
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:08,240
how many people got off their benzos

995
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:12,240
for using lemon balm like lemon balm

996
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,839
therapy spirit of compassion recommended

997
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:15,520
over the last 35 years

998
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:19,359
information is in this book take it to

999
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:22,400
your doctor

1000
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:22,400
guys we're having fun

1001
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:26,800
i'm gonna pop a little bit of water in

1002
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,800
here

1003
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:37,599
i'm gonna send this down

1004
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:40,160
so good i love to taste the lemon balm

1005
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:42,160
instantly instantly puts me in a really

1006
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:44,839
good mood if i'm already in a good mood

1007
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:48,400
it just puts me in even a better mood

1008
00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:52,079
so move on down the line a little bit

1009
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:53,680
curcumin that's great for anxiety too

1010
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:55,440
because curcumin is a natural like a

1011
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:57,760
natural aspirin

1012
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,560
so it's a natural anti-inflammatory not

1013
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,560
because

1014
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:02,880
it's killing off all the pathogens that

1015
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:04,800
create inflammation

1016
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:06,480
that's not why because it's

1017
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:10,720
phytochemical compounds

1018
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:12,640
and you know in turmeric and curcumin

1019
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:14,880
is all part of that it's all bundled up

1020
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,760
in there and those phytochemical

1021
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,160
compounds

1022
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:20,640
have an aspirin like effect so i like

1023
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:23,920
curcumin because

1024
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:26,400
it lowers inflammation in the body

1025
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:28,240
even if doctors and practitioners and

1026
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,520
people on you know doctors on youtubes

1027
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:32,079
or whatever podcasts or

1028
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:33,440
in magazines don't know why you're

1029
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:35,359
inflamed

1030
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:37,119
they don't know why you're inflamed

1031
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:39,040
curcumin is good for inflammation well

1032
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:40,560
it's true it is good for inflammation

1033
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:42,560
but i like the best one so that's in

1034
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:43,280
here too and that can calm anxiety down

1035
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:46,800
a little bit

1036
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:48,800
dr faun md

1037
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,640
there's lots of low quality curcumins

1038
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:52,640
out there with additives

1039
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,760
keep that in mind and they don't even

1040
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,280
tell you

1041
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,800
when there's even more additives in

1042
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,280
there that are not that are not even on

1043
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,960
the

1044
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:00,079
ingredient list but that are in it

1045
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:02,320
because i told you about that whole

1046
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:05,839
thing bemidji refuses to do

1047
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:07,920
they refuse to let a certain percentage

1048
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:09,359
of manufactured additives go into their

1049
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:11,520
products that all the other supplement

1050
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:13,920
companies let in

1051
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:15,839
and people say well why is he always you

1052
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,640
know pushing their stuff or talking

1053
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:18,319
about their stuff

1054
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:19,520
because it's the best i use it friends

1055
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:21,040
and family use it but it's more than

1056
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:24,319
that

1057
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:27,599
not just the best it's because

1058
00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:29,920
they like put their foot down

1059
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:31,520
and when you're chronically ill you need

1060
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,200
somebody that's got your back you need

1061
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,599
people that got your back that put their

1062
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:37,359
foot

1063
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:39,359
down i put my foot down all the time

1064
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:40,960
because i'm just like i don't care if

1065
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:42,720
the caffeine industry is pissed at me i

1066
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:44,800
don't care if everybody's mad at me the

1067
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:48,160
apple cider vinegar people are at my

1068
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:49,520
front door with torches and and shovels

1069
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:51,440
and pitchforks

1070
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:53,119
i don't care if you know like whoever's

1071
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,760
knocking on my door the charcoal people

1072
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:55,599
and

1073
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,720
the ionizer water machine people are mad

1074
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:58,000
at me and everybody's mad at me because

1075
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,760
i'm trying to protect the chronically

1076
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,319
ill someone's got to put their foot down

1077
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:03,040
and and have the chronic legs back it's

1078
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:05,119
not just

1079
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:06,960
it's that it's not just knowing the true

1080
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:08,400
cause of why we're sick and how to heal

1081
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:11,440
and how to do protocols it's more than

1082
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:15,680
that it's about having your back too

1083
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:15,680
it's all of it it's important

1084
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:23,040
there's some i mean yeah

1085
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:26,160
magnesium glycinate that's in the

1086
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:29,839
anxiety section so what does it say

1087
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:33,680
three capsules daily magnesium

1088
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:34,319
relaxes muscles muscles get wigged out

1089
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:37,359
because

1090
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:40,880
nerves are wigged out all the nerves

1091
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:40,880
going through all our muscles

1092
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:44,880
get all wigged out because of toxins and

1093
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,920
toxic heavy metals and viral neurotoxins

1094
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:48,160
like i was talking about

1095
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:50,880
creating anxiety and other problems so

1096
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:53,440
then our muscles

1097
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:55,520
get pushed to their limit not because

1098
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:57,200
they're being used like a workout

1099
00:41:55,520 --> 00:42:00,000
they're being pushed to the limit on a

1100
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,000
stress level

1101
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:06,640
so i love magnesium glycinate

1102
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,839
you'll see more magnesium glycinate out

1103
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:09,359
there because

1104
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:11,119
medical medium information is the most

1105
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:13,760
advanced

1106
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:15,599
and it leads the way in all of health if

1107
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:17,200
you're somebody like that's not possible

1108
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:19,119
i i don't even know why this guy's

1109
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:20,400
saying this it's true and it's all fact

1110
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:21,599
and it's true

1111
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:24,000
the books don't lie they've been

1112
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:24,800
published first it leads the way in

1113
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,240
information

1114
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:28,640
lectures i've done over the years leads

1115
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:30,079
the way in information and glycinate now

1116
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:32,880
magnesium glycine you'll see

1117
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:35,680
it now out there and all the supplement

1118
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:37,680
companies that made all these mistakes

1119
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:39,680
they're now putting glycinate magnesium

1120
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:42,079
glycinate and stuff it's like

1121
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:42,960
medical medium information is upgrading

1122
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:44,800
all the time

1123
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:46,560
the world of natural medicine in

1124
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,520
conventional medicine too and chronic

1125
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:50,319
illness

1126
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:51,119
glycinate's really important that

1127
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:52,640
magnesium

1128
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:55,359
so we got that that's of energy

1129
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:57,280
magnesium i take a bunch of that

1130
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:59,359
i take a bunch of that every single day

1131
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:02,400
that's what i do

1132
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:04,319
so vitamin c why is vitamin c important

1133
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:06,079
for anxiety like

1134
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:08,800
when i was younger i'd say the spirit of

1135
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:10,960
compassion like why vitamin c

1136
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:13,200
i hate having these annoying questions

1137
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:16,720
but why

1138
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:19,760
because your anxiety is spawned on

1139
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:21,920
by low-grade viral infections

1140
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:23,440
and that's what's happening to everyone

1141
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:25,200
spirit combat should be like everybody's

1142
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,960
anxiety spawned on by low-grade viral

1143
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:29,359
infections

1144
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:30,960
and free radicals such as toxic heavy

1145
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:33,520
metals

1146
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:36,240
vitamin c doesn't take out all the toxic

1147
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:40,160
heavy metals that's not it at all

1148
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:42,240
but at least it helps to neutralize

1149
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:43,520
byproduct and runoff from toxic heavy

1150
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:46,960
metals

1151
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:51,280
the black stuff that

1152
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:55,359
oxidizes the black oxidation

1153
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:57,119
that material that oxidizes

1154
00:43:55,359 --> 00:44:00,960
it comes off of toxic heavy metals

1155
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:04,079
vitamin c helps to neutralize that

1156
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:06,480
that oxidation vitamin c

1157
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:08,000
helps to lower low-grade viral

1158
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:09,920
infections that are causing somebody's

1159
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,160
anxiety this covers i'm talking about

1160
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:14,000
all neurological symptoms too you guys

1161
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:16,240
low-grade viral infections toxic heavy

1162
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,319
metals a lot of that neurological lyme

1163
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:20,640
people are jacked up in tons of mercury

1164
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:22,800
they got mercury in them

1165
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:24,240
they're loaded with mercury mercury in

1166
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,680
the brain mercury in their nervous

1167
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:27,839
system mercury in their liver when they

1168
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:30,000
got neurological lyme

1169
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:32,960
jacked up with mercury and low-grade

1170
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,960
viral infections

1171
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:38,240
yep i see there's a lot of trolls there

1172
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:40,079

1183
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,760
section

1184
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:02,240
this is a different kind of live this is

1185
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:04,480
a live showing you

1186
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:06,240
an example if you find your symptom you

1187
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:07,599
find your condition

1188
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:09,920
if you're somebody with multiple

1189
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:14,160
symptoms multiple conditions

1190
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:17,200
pick the one that bothers you the most

1191
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:18,800
you can pick another one too but if you

1192
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:20,480
pick the one that's bothering you the

1193
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:22,000
most chances are a lot of the other

1194
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:25,280
symptoms will start going away as you're

1195
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,280
healing which is really great

1196
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:29,440
the best book marisa clenzie heel

1197
00:45:30,839 --> 00:45:35,200
yep so moving down the line a little bit

1198
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:36,880
let's go into a couple other different

1199
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:41,200
conditions so

1200
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:41,200
um i want to talk about that as well

1201
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:46,720
so if you're somebody that's like but i

1202
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:48,319
don't want to do all these supplements

1203
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:50,000
but i want to do medical medium i want

1204
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:51,280
to know the protocols i want to know how

1205
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,640
to heal

1206
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:57,200
then you do the top four and i talk

1207
00:45:54,640 --> 00:46:00,640
about in here b12 is one of the top four

1208
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:04,560
right there lemon balm vitamin c

1209
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:09,440
one of the top four right or you can do

1210
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:11,599
top eight you can do top eight zinc

1211
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:12,560
right there it's important there too so

1212
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:16,480
you do some zinc

1213
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:19,119
you got your b12 you got your vitamin c

1214
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:19,760
okay that's top three you could do top

1215
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:22,720
two

1216
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:23,680
maybe pick the b12 and the zinc right

1217
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,880
there

1218
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:26,640
you don't it's not about being

1219
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:29,520
overwhelmed it's about knowing you're

1220
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:32,000
heading in the right direction

1221
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:33,119
and knowing a little bit at a time you

1222
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,359
can chip away

1223
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:38,000
and chip away and climb up that ladder

1224
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:38,000
and heal

1225
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:40,880
but then people pick the wrong

1226
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:44,480
supplements they'll pick the wrong

1227
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:47,599
supplement or the wrong kind or whatever

1228
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:50,240
details matter when you gotta heal man

1229
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:51,599
they matter it was complicated when we

1230
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:56,079
got sick

1231
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:59,520
it was complicated when we got sick

1232
00:46:56,079 --> 00:47:01,599
right complicated toxic heavy metals

1233
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:04,400
from utero

1234
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:07,839
complicated different viral infections

1235
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:09,760
in streptococcus throughout the years

1236
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:12,079
contracting it with just you know you

1237
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:14,720
know on the dating scene

1238
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:17,280
for some people got a new streptococcus

1239
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:20,720
here got a new fever blister here

1240
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:23,200
it gets complicated right

1241
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:26,000
drank off of somebody's glass in high

1242
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:27,680
school and got mono

1243
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:30,000
jorah says medical medium healed my

1244
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:32,640
cystic acne microc was a big help

1245
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,240

1246
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:37,440
i'm honored to hear

00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:40,000
thank you for being here getting sick is

1248
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:43,359
is complicated we burn our adrenals out

1249
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,359
we do years of caffeine

1250
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:47,440
marissa says it's about understanding

1251
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:49,680
what causes your symptoms and conditions

1252
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:51,520
it really matters exactly

1253
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:53,839
but when you understand your symptoms

1254
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:55,119
and conditions it's a huge part about it

1255
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:56,720
right

1256
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:59,440
and that's what i love about this

1257
00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:03,760
knowing the cause and the protocol

1258
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:05,200
matters it's complicated when we get

1259
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:06,880
sick

1260
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:08,400
we contract a lot of different viruses

1261
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:11,200
throughout our life eating in

1262
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:13,920
restaurants public bathrooms

1263
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:16,880
through other people right that passed

1264
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:19,760
down from our parents

1265
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:20,000
and we get a lot of toxic heavy metals

1266
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:22,640
from

1267
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,880
medical treatments there's toxic heavy

1268
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:26,720
metals and antibiotics

1269
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:28,960
lots of it lots of it we take an

1270
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:29,520
antibiotic there's toxic heavy metals in

1271
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:31,119
there

1272
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:33,200
it's toxic heavy metals and

1273
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:36,800
pharmaceuticals

1274
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:37,359

1275
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:40,160

1297
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:24,079

how we have to know what's wrong and we

1302
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:39,760
have to know what to do

1303
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,440
we have to know what's wrong and why it

1304
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:45,359
happened and we have to know what to do

1305
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:49,119
what to do this is what how it works

1306
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:51,200
you can't heal entirely if you have a

1307
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:53,599
problem if you don't know why you're

1308
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,599
sick

1309
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:57,680
you know what's crazy is someone who

1310
00:49:55,599 --> 00:50:00,400
gets sick today

1311
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:02,000
it looks like it looks like everything

it is my nutritionist

1323
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:24,240
and you're gonna and you think it's all

1324
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:27,680
there

1325
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:31,119
and everybody's like uh you got candida

1326
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:33,440
um you got it's

1327
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:35,040
you're actually it's genetic or you got

1328
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:38,720
autoimmune that's not an

1329
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:41,440
answer like those aren't answers

1330
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:43,440
you a gut health problem we got to

1331
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:45,920
balance your flora that's not that's not

1332
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,920
an answer

1333
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:51,440
marianne says why is the glycerin needed

1334
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:52,880
in the bemrg supplements

1335
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:55,280
a lot of other supplements don't have

1336
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:56,800
glycerin

1337
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:58,480
so there's a reason why one of the

1338
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:01,599
reasons why

1339
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:03,599
is because you can't just

1340
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:05,359
first of all you don't want it in a

1341
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:09,040
powder when it comes down to

1342
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:13,280
herbs number one you don't want it in

1343
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:16,640
a powder absorption doesn't happen

1344
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:19,520
it doesn't happen okay

1345
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:20,319
number two all nutrients absorb into

1346
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:24,640
your cells

1347
00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:30,000
through some type of glucose

1348
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:30,000
some type of glucose by attaching

1349
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:36,480
those phytochemical compounds to a

1350
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:38,559
glucose you can absorb it

1351
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:40,240
that's why all those powders and

1352
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:42,960
formulas out there

1353
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:44,240
that people take so dumping in it's not

1354
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:46,319
attached to a glucose

1355
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:49,200
it'll never absorb and they just poop it

1356
00:51:46,319 --> 00:51:52,160
out and poop it out poop it out

1357
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:53,200
so and you don't want alcohol so you

1358
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:56,480
have to have

1359
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:58,720
the glycerin but the key is

1360
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:00,720
when you use the glycerin the glycerin

1361
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:02,800
is a glucose a form of glucose that

1362
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:04,720
attaches itself to the nutrients and

1363
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:07,520
then draws the nutrients into

1364
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:07,520
your cells

1365
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:12,800
it's really brilliant really it's just

1366
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:18,079
it's it's brilliant how

1367
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:20,240
our bodies work and what they need

1368
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:20,240
so

1369
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:27,280
so glycerin is glucose yeah the form

1370
00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:28,880
the form everything that's a

1371
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:30,480
carbohydrate or sugar of any kind that

1372
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:30,960
goes inside our body that's involved in

1373
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:33,200
our body

1374
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:34,720
floating around in her body is glucose

1375
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,359
so the minute the glycerin enters your

1376
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:38,559
mouth it

1377
00:52:35,359 --> 00:52:40,319
it's glucose boom it's glucose

1378
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:42,800

1464
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:37,280
see how it works you guys

1465
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:43,200
the list here is simply a starting point

1466
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:47,119
start with fresh celery juice

1467
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:47,119
maybe celery force

1468
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:52,640
it's not because your body is different

1469
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:54,559
we're human beings

1470
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:56,240
strike 77 wasn't that funny the other

1471
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:58,880
day

1472
00:55:56,240 --> 00:56:02,240
strength good to see you turned out it

1473
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:07,119
was a mistake

1474
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:10,960
so anyway you guys

1475
00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:11,520

00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:13,839
tea

1477
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:15,040
like a lemon balm tea you can take it

1478
00:56:13,839 --> 00:56:17,599
gently you can do

1479
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:18,480
you can just do little things it's not

1480
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:23,440
because

1481
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:25,760
your body is different

1482
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:27,599
it's because of what's residing inside

00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:28,960
your body is different

1484
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:30,799
someone could have had a big trigger

1485
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:32,160
they could have mold exposure and they

1486
00:56:30,799 --> 00:56:34,559
got two viruses

1487
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:35,920
and they got toxic heavy metals and they

1488
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:38,240
had a fluoride treatment

1489
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:39,440
too many one fluoride treatment too many

1490
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:41,119
you guys had too many fluoride

1491
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:43,040
treatments

1492
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:44,640
some people got scented candles burning

1493
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:46,000
in their house all day long

1494
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:48,240
they go out and they get a fluoride

1495
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,599
treatment right

1496
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:52,000
and it pushes and they just have their

1497
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:53,440
carpets cleaned some people love to get

1498
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,920
their carpets cleaned by a conventional

1499
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:57,119
carpet cleaning service every month

1500
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:59,440
and they're getting saturated with

1501
00:56:57,119 --> 00:57:01,359
solvents and poisoned

1502
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:03,280
everybody's different it's about what

1503
00:57:01,359 --> 00:57:03,760
you have inside of you that makes you

1504
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:04,880
different

1505
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:07,839
and that's that's how it works the

1506
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:09,440
chemical sensitivities tammy winters

1507
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:11,599
i've been doing celery force for six

1508
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:14,240
weeks it already has helped my

1509
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:14,720
split nails oh celery juice for six

1510
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:16,799
weeks

1511
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:19,760
it already has helped my split nails

1512
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:23,680
lower blood pressure and chronic fatigue

1513
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:26,079
incredible incredible and guess what

1514
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:28,160
guess what if you go into the chronic

1515
00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:30,880
fatigue syndrome section

1516
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:32,400
right here in the book you can look at

1517
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:35,119
other things you can do

1518
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:35,839
if celery juice isn't enough yet because

1519
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:37,839
you may have

1520
00:57:35,839 --> 00:57:39,200
someone's fatigue can go away with

1521
00:57:37,839 --> 00:57:40,480
celery juice every day

1522
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:41,599
somebody else's might be there a little

1523
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:43,200
more stubborn because we've got some

1524
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:47,040
other problems so we have to go a little

1525
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:47,040
deeper we need to know the protocols

1526
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:53,760
for the other urban supplements take one

1527
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:54,960
take only one supplement one day

1528
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:56,400
another the next so one of the

1529
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:58,960
techniques for chemical sensitivity is

1530
00:57:56,400 --> 00:58:02,640
just take one supplement a day

1531
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:06,000
the next day you take another supplement

1532
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:06,000
the next day you take another one

1533
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:09,359
that's a technique right there you can

1534
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:11,040
read about in here if you decide to take

1535
00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:11,920
all of the supplements in this list it

1536
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:14,799
means you'll be

1537
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:15,119
on an eight day cycle a sensitivity is

1538
00:58:14,799 --> 00:58:16,720
yet

1539
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:18,079
another reason to stay away from

1540
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:19,520
supplements with 50 ingredients let's

1541
00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:21,839
talk about that right now this is really

1542
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:23,200
important

1543
00:58:21,839 --> 00:58:24,880
one there's a way to move forward for

1544
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:25,920
everybody there's just a way to move

1545
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:28,880
forward

1546
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:30,240
it exists been here for 35 years since i

1547
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:31,920
started working with people and i worked

1548
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:35,599
with people when i was a little

1549
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:39,920
practical baby so

1550
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:41,839
but the point is there is a way right

1551
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:43,680
there is a way now there's something

1552
00:58:41,839 --> 00:58:44,079
really important what was just said in

1553
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:47,200
here

1554
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:49,119
right here in this book a sensitivity is

1555
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:51,040
yet another reason to stay away from

1556
00:58:49,119 --> 00:58:54,640
supplements with 50 ingredients in a

1557
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:57,680
bottle and i mean 20 ingredients too

1558
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:57,680
not just 50

1559
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:06,960
multivitamins multivitamin bottles

1560
00:59:03,839 --> 00:59:08,559
infamous for not only ripping people off

1561
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:10,880
not only not helping because it's a

1562
00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:13,040
smidgen of a low quality thing in there

1563
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:14,799
a smidgen smooth mission

1564
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:16,240
but it's aggravating for people who are

1565
00:59:14,799 --> 00:59:18,240
sensitive

1566
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:19,520
multivitamins are aggravating for people

1567
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:21,119
who are sensitive

1568
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:24,720
if you're somebody sensitive and you're

1569
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:27,920
taking lemon balm and a multivitamin

1570
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:32,319
you'll probably think the multivitamin

1571
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:34,160
is great and the lemon balm is a problem

1572
00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:36,319
even though lemon balm's just one thing

1573
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:36,799
one thing with the multivitamin you'd be

1574
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:38,880
like no

1575
00:59:36,799 --> 00:59:40,640
multivitamins we get brainwashed we get

1576
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:42,079

best multivitamin that i've ever

1580
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:53,359
used for myself is what you're seeing

1581
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:56,640
right here

1582
00:59:53,359 --> 00:59:58,480
barley grass juice powder right right in

1583
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:59,599
to say this melon or in the heavy metal

1584
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:04,079
detox smoothie

1585
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:07,359
and spirulina combined okay for years

1586
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:07,359

1587
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:11,839

of each

1594
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:26,240

really good for

1596
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:31,359
women who are pregnant would be a

by the way engineer flu family

1748
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:44,480
many many years ago there were different

1749
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:46,240
varieties of common cold viruses that

1750
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:48,079
could give you the sniffles a scratchy

1751
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:49,200
throat and sometimes a fever under 100

1752
01:06:48,079 --> 01:06:52,160
degrees

1753
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:52,880
that was the cold virus for many many

1754
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:56,640
years

1755
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:56,640
a long time ago

1756
01:06:57,440 --> 01:07:00,720
in order for this to happen you would

1757
01:06:59,119 --> 01:07:01,680
really need to have a lowered immune

1758
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:03,680
system

1759
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:05,119
which most often occurred due to not

1760
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:07,119
being clothed right

1761
01:07:05,119 --> 01:07:08,880
check this out you guys for damp weather

1762
01:07:07,119 --> 01:07:12,400
and experiencing temperature shock from

1763
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:12,400
being exposed to the elements

1764
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:17,280
these cold viruses never created what

1765
01:07:14,799 --> 01:07:19,359
we're up against in the present today

1766
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:20,400
today if we experience those symptoms

1767
01:07:19,359 --> 01:07:22,079
and they're mild

1768
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:24,559
we're really dealing with a mild

1769
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:27,039
influenza strain

1770
01:07:24,559 --> 01:07:27,680
when the symptoms are worse we're still

1771
01:07:27,039 --> 01:07:30,720

1772
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:32,319

1783
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:52,160
people's immune systems are down more

1784
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:54,640
than ever before

1785
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:56,160
in our history and this year this year

1786
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:59,119
people's immune systems are

1787
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:59,520
just flat busted right now people are

1788
01:07:59,119 --> 01:08:01,920
going to be

1789
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:03,920
contracting flus more than ever i'm not

1790
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:05,920
trying to spook anybody i'm just saying

1791
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:07,359
you might want to just be prepared talk

1792
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:08,720
to your doctor if you want to

1793
01:08:07,359 --> 01:08:10,559
ask your doctor if it's okay you can

1794
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:12,319
have a little zinc or you know some good

1795
01:08:10,559 --> 01:08:13,440
quality zinc like the best quality zinc

1796
01:08:12,319 --> 01:08:15,359
or something in some

1797
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:17,120
micro sea or something so we're in

1798
01:08:15,359 --> 01:08:18,880
supplements and protocol section of cold

1799
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:20,239
and flu

1800
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:23,040
so let's just talk about this a little

1801
01:08:20,239 --> 01:08:25,279
bit this is important

1802
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:27,679
even the stomach bugs that go around are

1803
01:08:25,279 --> 01:08:30,319
particular strains of the flu unless you

1804
01:08:27,679 --> 01:08:32,239
had food poisoning you guys

1805
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:34,000
the flu can enter a family of five and

1806
01:08:32,239 --> 01:08:35,839
each individual can experience different

1807
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:39,279
symptoms as the strain leaves one family

1808
01:08:35,839 --> 01:08:41,279
member and moves on to the next

1809
01:08:39,279 --> 01:08:43,040
the strain mutates from person to person

1810
01:08:41,279 --> 01:08:43,679
plus everybody's immune system reacts

1811
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:45,920
differently

1812
01:08:43,679 --> 01:08:47,440
so the last family member's flu may be

1813
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:48,319
very different from the first family

1814
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:50,239
member's flu

1815
01:08:48,319 --> 01:08:51,520
for example one person may get a sore

1816
01:08:50,239 --> 01:08:53,440
throat runny nose

1817
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:55,759
and cough for three days while the next

1818
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:59,440
gets 103 degree temperature and a very

1819
01:08:55,759 --> 01:09:02,480
long lasting cough and sinus drainage

1820
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:02,480
