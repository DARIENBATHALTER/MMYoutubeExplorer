00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,160
history now and we've sort of been a

18
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,879
Trailblazer in our own way both in the

19
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:43,440
transformational sphere and the werness

20
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:45,120

and cold press juices you know well

22
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,399
before most restaurants you know 20

23
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:51,559
years ago but this is a really beautiful

24
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:54,359
opportunity to kind of build on what was

25
00:00:51,559 --> 00:00:56,000
our traditions in the past and bring the

26
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:58,320

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,039

29
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:03,320
your community here you know and having

30
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,479
letting them have the experience of a

31
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,880
place where they can come and eat in a

32
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:07,840
restaurant environment so it's very

33
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:10,000
exciting yeah we have just been having

34
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,479
the most incredible week it's night four

35
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,799
our final night now how do you feel this

36
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,799
whole four nights have gone well you

37
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,119
know I think when we originally

38
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:20,920
conceived it I wasn't expecting it to be

39
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:22,840
so well supported by the community so

40
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:24,360
just seeing this whole setup all the

41
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,280
work that you've all been doing and the

42
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,200
way that your community has showed up

43
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,920
and really sort of taken advantage of it

44
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,400
and embraced it has been an incred

45
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,119
incredible sort of enlightening

46
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:35,399
experience for me and it's been super

47
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,799
fun you know super fun and it's rare

48
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:39,960
that you find a group of people so open

49
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:42,200
and happy and supportive and really

50
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,920
committed to health and wellness yeah

51
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,560
it's such an uplifting beautiful

52
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,200
community and I feel like you're

53
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,240
bringing joy and happiness to this

54
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,280
community through a dining experience

55
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,320
that normally they wouldn't get because

56
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,840
you know they worry about the

57
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,439
ingredients on the menu so how does it

58
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,560
feel to bring that joy and happiness to

59
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:02,880
this community Through dining well I

60
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,759
mean for me as a chef it's providing a

61
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,640
Hospitality experience is always the the

62
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,520
highest you know level of importance for

63
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:12,319
me and you don't often I I personally

64
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:15,080
have a diet that's very similar to the

65
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,879
medical medium protocol um some slight

66
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:19,319
variations but I'm a long-term you know

67
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:21,280
vegan and I I sort of you know don't

68
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:24,560
usually use oils and and you know

69
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:28,360
heavily refined Foods either so my own

70
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:30,879
food is now being influenced by the this

71
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:33,239
community and what we're doing here so I

72
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:35,760
just feel that it's a really great

73
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:37,160
opportunity for me to build on the the

74
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,760
menu that I've done for all these years

75
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:41,319
of Cafe Gratitude the work that I've

76
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:43,040
done in this community and maybe find a

77
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:45,200
new way to express myself as a chef so

78
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:48,200
it's been great it is so beautiful like

79
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:50,400
the crossover of communities uh one

80
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:53,120
finding out about the other and and so

81
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,599
on now aw has said that you have taken

82
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,360
his recipes to the next level like you

83
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:59,000
really upped the flavor profile how did

84
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,920
you do that well he's being very

85
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,519
generous for all

86
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:06,000
um I think that it was an interesting

87
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,640
set of guidelines to work with um in a

88
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,200
restaurant context like I as I said

89
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:11,319
earlier my own personal diet and the way

90
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,599
I eat and my private life is one thing

91
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:15,319
but when you're in a restaurant setting

92
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:16,959
and you're trying to create food that is

93
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:19,440
going to appeal to a broad spectrum of

94
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,560
people with those I don't want to say

95
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,400
restrictions but with those

96
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,959
considerations right like not using soy

97
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:28,159
not using vinegars not using corn you

98
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:29,560
know nuts and gluten and all that stuff

99
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:31,959
I was sort of halfway there already

100
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:33,720
because we are primarily gluten-free you

101
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:36,879
know I don't use any refined you know

102
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:39,879
vegan foods in in the menu but this was

103
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:42,239
a way for me to look at um I don't know

104
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:44,680
how I want to say this but to really go

105
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,439
I hate to use this word cleaner you know

106
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:49,959
with with everything that we're doing

107
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:51,480
and um I feel like just slight changes

108
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:54,760
can make a really big difference in the

109
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:55,879
flavor the flavor profile of foods so

110
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,959
yeah and there's people that have

111
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:59,480
traveled here from all around the world

112
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:01,200
and they're just loving your work well

113
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:03,560
thank you I mean it's been I've actually

114
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,079
been very surprised by by how well it's

115
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:07,120
been received and I do think it's

116
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:09,000
because they haven't had the opportunity

117
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,879
I mean I feel I feel great about the

118
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,400
work that I've done with this menu um

119
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,760
and I'm just really happy that people

120
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,280
are appreciating it I don't know how

121
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,799
else to say it yeah everyone's talking

122
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,759
about the sushi

123
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:20,919
rolls oh my gosh incredible they're

124
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,600
saying they've never had anything like

125
00:04:20,919 --> 00:04:25,320
it before so can you tell me more about

126
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:26,759
them well I think that you know a lot of

127
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,680
people when they do a vegan Sushi

128
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:28,800
especially when you're saying oh we

129
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,520
don't want vinegar we don't want sugar

130
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,400
you don't want to but you know you could

131
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:34,120
what I did was I looked at it how can I

132
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,600
season this in a way that follows these

133
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,880
guidelines you know so I use some lemon

134
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,479
juice I use a little bit of honey I use

135
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:42,160
some dull flakes um the pumpkin SE tofu

136
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:43,479
has been a big hit which is another you

137
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,039
know thing that not many people are

138
00:04:43,479 --> 00:04:48,800
aware of so that gives it a nice sort of

139
00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:50,400
proteiny kind of vibe that that a normal

140
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,400
vegetable Sushi doesn't have we use a

141
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:55,639
high quality rice um yeah keeping it

142
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:57,600
clean and simple but playing with the

143
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:59,160
flavor profile to give it a bit of a

144
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,400
punch you know how long does that

145
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:04,240
pumpkin food take to is that a process

146
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:06,039
we marinate well yeah so we get the the

147
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,000
base ingredients and then we marinate it

148
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:10,759
overnight um so yeah I mean it's not

149
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,320
it's not that complicated no I mean most

150
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:15,840
tofu people don't realize it's actually

151
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:18,400
fairly simple food to make yeah yeah wow

152
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:21,039
and the the Millet tortillas tortillas I

153
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,680
had those on Friday night and the way

154
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,680
they hold together that was a bit of a

155
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:27,039
journey I mean it's taking us a little

156
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:28,319
while to get the hang of that I know and

157
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,919
you know we've had a lot of disasters

158
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:31,840
but I think we finally have got it down

159
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,400
inshi rolling is a new thing for my team

160
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,680
as well but they've really they finally

161
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:37,240
like having made hundreds now um because

00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,919
event that made you want to come out

185
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:18,240
this evening well I know it's a Once in

186
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:21,520
a Lifetime really um I'm from a small

187
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,360
community in Canada so I never get to

188
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,639
eat out and I'm sure it won't happen

189
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,560
again for a long time so I'm really

190
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:30,160
excited for this food it's amazing I've

191
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:31,720
already tried it it's fantastic

192
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,800
yes did you come with anyone this

193
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:35,840
evening or did you come alone or met up

194
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,880
with friends here so yeah really excited

195
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,520
to dine with everybody and get to know

196
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:41,120
more people because there's just so many

197
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,680
people in the community that I think

198
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,160
even when I think I've seen everybody

199
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,919
like there's just so many of us and it's

200
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,039
so many M mate that's right what are you

201
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:49,720
most excited about with this

202
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:52,960
collaboration between medical medium and

203
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:54,759
Cafe Gratitude the fearlessness of being

204
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,400
able to order food and knowing that

205
00:06:54,759 --> 00:07:00,520
somebody understands why I eat this way

206
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:02,599
and what I need to feel comfortable you

207
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,840
know they are creating their business

208
00:07:02,599 --> 00:07:05,759
because they want to provide something

209
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,080
for the people and so the fact that they

210
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,759
meet our needs is just amazing it is

211
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,120
incredible how did your medical medium

212
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,919
journey start how did you first come

213
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:16,000
across the information I'm lucky enough

214
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:18,560
that my sister came across the

215
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,599
information actually she was really sick

216
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,240
she needed a lot of help um but she was

217
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,960
not really sure if she could trust the

218
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:27,360
information yet she didn't know whether

219
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:30,440
to really take it on or not and she kept

220
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,759
conving in me and asking what do I think

221
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,599
of it and at the time I didn't know

222
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:36,240
medical medium I didn't understand the

223
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:38,199
concept so I wasn't super supportive but

224
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,440
luckily I told her I was like I'll read

225
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:42,759
the book and tell you why I think it's

226
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:45,599
probably not real and after page five I

227
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:47,560
said oh my God I think this is it and

228
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:50,000
from then I just started to implement

229
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:53,080
small steps every two weeks I give

230
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,680
myself a timeline and say if if if

231
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:56,240
something happens then I know it works

232
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:58,919
if it doesn't then I can say I was right

233
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:01,720
all along you know but and here you are

234
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:03,840
now gratitude exactly and everything

235
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,560
worked that I tried to this day I've

236
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:08,039
been doing medical medium for 8 years

237
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:10,400
and everything he recommends does

238
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:12,879
something it moves the needle in

239
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,280
miraculous ways wow so what are some of

240
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,000
the health benefits that you found from

241
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,319
using medical medium information and

242
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,800
what were some of the symptoms and

243
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:21,680
conditions you were dealing with prior

244
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,639
to starting this my worst and severe

245
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,560
most severe condition was mental health

246
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:29,840
issues I dealt with a lot of depression

247
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:33,959
and anxiety and OCD thoughts um and even

248
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:36,159
like dyslexia add and just over like

249
00:08:33,959 --> 00:08:38,560
committing it takes time but when you

250
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:41,120
commit it changes and so now I no longer

251
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:43,080
have dyslexia and for me I mean that has

252
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,240
been amazing because it's meant I have

253
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:49,080
new employment opportunities that I

254
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:52,120
never had before and just you know it

255
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:54,720
just it just changes everything when you

256
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:57,240
can be yourself and succeed when you

257
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,720
didn't have the opportunity before yeah

258
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,920
that's incredible do you have an

259
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,200
encouraging message you would like to

260
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:05,040
share with the community online sure um

261
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,920
I think really it's it's small steps to

262
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,600
Perfection um or to progress as however

263
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:12,079
anyone wants to say it and it doesn't

264
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,839
have to be done overnight um we took

265
00:09:12,079 --> 00:09:16,880
years and decades to get sick and so it

266
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:19,360
takes time to heal and I think it you

267
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:21,079
just have to commit to it you know and I

268
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,560
see it as a challenge a lot of times of

269
00:09:21,079 --> 00:09:26,720
like how much more can my body heal how

270
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:30,160
much more can I improve and what changes

271
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:32,120
can happen because it's it is ulous what

272
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,600
happens I like the way you're saying

273
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:35,279
that it takes time I think that's really

274
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,360
good to remind people it's not overnight

275
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,959
especially if you've been dealing with

276
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:41,360
it for a long time but also I like how

277
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:43,360
you say how healthy can I get or how how

278
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,600
much can I improve that's that's kind of

279
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,959
cool to focus on it it is really cool

280
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,160
and sometimes I think okay I must be

281
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:51,360
done healing now and then I do another

282
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:53,480
369 and I'm like oh wow but more

283
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,959
happened like what else could it be that

284
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:57,240
that changes so it's very cool are you

okay um so my 10-year-old son was sick

315
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:09,760
he was very sick for 18 months doctors

316
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:11,240
couldn't find out what was wrong we had

317
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,480
a long list of

318
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:16,720
diagnoses um he could no longer go to

319
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,320
school he his life

320
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,600
stopped and every day I was working so

321
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,760
hard you know to try to figure out and

322
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,399
we were just being told it was

323
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:27,600
autoimmune he's going to have it for the

324
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:29,880
rest of his life um probably managed by

325
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,160
Pharmaceuticals and I just would accept

326
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:34,639
it it just did not

327
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:37,560
resonate and um I was sitting in the

328
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:39,959
garden and I was in such despair I was

329
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:41,560
really you know it was it after 18

330
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:44,680
months of every day it was just it was

331
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:47,800
too much and I came across an Instagram

332
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:52,959
post about dark circles under from mm

333
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:56,680
mhm and it within an hour I was juicing

334
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:59,279
celery for my son I ran to the store and

335
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:02,120
I had a juicer and I Juiced celery and I

336
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:05,480
remember giving it to him and stepping

337
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:08,040
back hoping that he wouldn't just you

338
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:10,279
know have a that he would accept it and

339
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:13,199
he did how did he react when he had that

340
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:16,560
first glass of celery juice he was he

341
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:18,959
drank it like nothing wow yeah

342
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:23,279
incredible so he was so thick I think he

343
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:25,800
was willing to do anything yeah so um I

344
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:28,760
went all in I took out the no Foods I

345
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:31,120
was in the K kitchen constantly learning

346
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:33,079
and learning and learning and non-stop I

347
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:37,320
mean every time I drove it was a podcast

00:12:33,079 --> 00:12:39,519
or something from aw and within a year

349
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:42,040
he was completely healed and that was

350
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,600
has been over 2 years ago now yeah can

351
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,839

352
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,800
about some of the symptoms and

353
00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:50,320

and how did you discover uh aw medical

433
00:15:56,839 --> 00:16:02,519
medium information I

434
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:06,279
discovered medical medium about six or

435
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:08,279
seven years ago or when his F he just

436
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:10,680
had two books at that time so that's the

437
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:13,120
how how long it was he had um medical

438
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:15,319
medium and life-changing foods and I was

439
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:19,240
really struggling I had a fibroid and I

440
00:16:15,319 --> 00:16:21,480
had um many surgeries and so his

441
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:24,759
information stopped the

442
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:26,360
surgeries wow so I was supposed to have

443
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:28,560
um another one and I didn't need it

444
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:30,199
after I found his info oh that's

445
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,079
incredible so did you first start with

446
00:16:30,199 --> 00:16:36,319
the celery juice and then add on from

447
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:38,319
there I I did but I um I really

448
00:16:36,319 --> 00:16:39,880
gravitated towards the heavy metal detox

449
00:16:38,319 --> 00:16:42,000
smoothie that was a very important piece

450
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:45,000
and that was the thing that I was the

451
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,000
most diligent with and then

452
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,040
supplementation and then changing like

453
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,319
removing troublemakers that's that was

454
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:55,040
my first wave and I feel like every year

455
00:16:51,319 --> 00:16:57,800
I go deeper and deeper yeah so healing

456
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:59,480
more and more healing more and more yeah

457
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,480
now because we're here at Cafe gratitude

458
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,720

459
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,560

through menopause a few years ago and

476
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:45,640

477
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,160

information do you have like one bit of

480
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,520
information in regards to that that you

481

celery juice like I was a little bit

485
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:05,840
resistant cuz I didn't enjoy the taste

486
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,760
at first like I love it now I was

487
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:11,240
gravitating more towards the heavy metal

488
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:13,600
detox smoothie but um celery juice and

489
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:16,440
avoiding troublemakers is a good start

490
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:18,400
like that alone will help significantly

491
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:21,919

552
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,799
are some of the health benefits that

553
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,120
you've noticed from the medical medium

554
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:52,559
protocol night and day absolutely

555
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:54,760
amazing it literally saved my life um I

556
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:57,000
was suffering terribly with anxiety

557
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:59,440
panic disorders fainting neurological

558
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,000
issues and that sort of thing I couldn't

559
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:06,720
leave my home um without having panic

560
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:08,799
attacks and now here I am in La you know

00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,760
you had a long plane ride too to be here

562
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:12,520
so that's amazing that you were able to

563
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:15,640
do all that too yeah cuz I suffered

564
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:18,799
claustrophobia acrophobia so to be in a

565
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:22,559
plane would have made me incredibly sick

566
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:26,159
and so I came here no symptoms no

567
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:29,640

event um ali um and um we connected

668
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,039
instantly you just connect with every in

669
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:21,919
the community it's actually something

670
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:23,600
that we all understand each other and we

671
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:26,320
don't have to say much we just

672
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:28,919
understand we've been through a lot um

673
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:30,520
and we have that in common and just like

674
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:31,960
we know where we're coming from and I

675
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:34,760
think the community is like one of the

676
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:37,520
best parts um of this I for years and

677
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:39,720
years like I was just in and out of the

678
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,960
hospital sick mystery illness doctors

679
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:44,559
don't know what they take all these

680
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:45,880
tests same with my mom and um nothing

681
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:47,679
they're just like you seem healthy but

682
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:49,679
yet they know I'm very sick they're like

683
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:52,039
but you look very sick I am very sick I

684
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:54,039
know you know you know your own body and

685
00:27:52,039 --> 00:27:56,679
no one understood until we found this

686
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:58,799
for once we feel understood for once

687
00:27:56,679 --> 00:28:01,679
like he's saying um

688
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:03,399
for the chronically ill and no if no one

689
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:05,039
even knows what that means like other

690
00:28:03,399 --> 00:28:06,600
people so it's like finally I felt like

691
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:08,679
I was seeing like friendch should be

692
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:10,200
like well you look fine or you know they

693
00:28:08,679 --> 00:28:11,720
didn't understand if you can't come out

694
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,919
no understands you're just in bed of

695
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:14,919
course you want to be going out you want

696
00:28:12,919 --> 00:28:17,279
to be living life you want to experience

697
00:28:14,919 --> 00:28:19,919
things and then it just holds you back

698
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:21,760
and so many people don't understand that

699
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:24,880
unless unfortunately they've been

700
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:26,679
through it so this is something that is

701
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,519
like nothing else I never even knew this

702
00:28:26,679 --> 00:28:30,200

ready I wanted to ask you something

1083
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:42,559
too can I ask you something to what's

1084
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:44,200
going on I've been uh sick for 33 years

1085
00:45:42,559 --> 00:45:47,400
and I've been doing your protocols for

1086
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:49,440
eight okay it depends on which ones are

1087
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:53,200
you customizing it are you trying to do

1088
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:54,800
more I'm working with Dr Nicole okay and

1089
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:57,480
so what you do is there's a lot of

1090
00:45:54,800 --> 00:46:00,000
information there it's volume

1091
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:01,319
okay and then but it sometimes it's it

1092
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,319
takes just a little bit I'm going to go

1093
00:46:01,319 --> 00:46:05,359
outside the box in here and go a little

1094
00:46:03,319 --> 00:46:07,520
bit further but but as long as you've

1095
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:10,079
been doing some things for for years now

1096
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:12,480
it all counts okay thank you for coming

1097
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:13,960
to ask can you ask es if he has any

1098
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:16,440
message for me or anything I'm

1099
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:19,119
overlooking in my work I I I think that

1100
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:20,760
there's I think you can do more in there

1101
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:22,160
that's going to feel comfortable so

1102
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:23,880
think think about that when you're

1103
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:25,359
looking at the information there's more

1104
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:29,640
but that's

1105
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:32,040
comfortable thank Anthony

question I did celery juice in 2019 I

00:55:47,079 --> 00:55:51,920
did it for three weeks I traveled to

1326
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:55,000
Canada so I did it at a juice store got

1327
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:56,720
a bug and now even smelling celery I'm

1328
00:55:55,000 --> 00:56:01,960
just like I want to vomit you know what

1329
00:55:56,720 --> 00:56:03,880
happens if you catch a flu or RSV or

1330
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:06,000
covid or something right and you were

1331
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:07,359
doing something around that time eating

1332
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,720
something it could have been anything it

1333
00:56:07,359 --> 00:56:11,359
could have been eating oatmeal eating

1334
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:14,240

still and it can last a lifetime a

1341
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:29,240
lifetime oh to get it back is doing

1342
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:30,559
coconut oil and they get really sick

1343
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:32,599

Thiago and Anthony you know he's non

1417
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:48,000
verbal so he has symptoms and he can't

1418
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:51,240
communicate with me and he can't tell me

1419
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:53,119
what's going on so I have to go off by

1420
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:55,000
what I see the symptoms that I see

1421
00:59:53,119 --> 00:59:57,760
Spirit of compassion says belly ache

1422
00:59:55,000 --> 01:00:00,200
sometimes that's the spirit says so so

1423
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:03,280
belly ache and it's very hard to express

1424
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:05,920
it but yeah there's no communication so

1425
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:08,079
I go off by the symptoms and I go to the

1426
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:10,799
book and then from there I go to the

1427
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:13,160
protocols so and then he rubs his ear

1428
01:00:10,799 --> 01:00:17,319
too once in a while and so sometimes it

1429
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:20,000
gets itchy inside okay so I just want to

1430
01:00:17,319 --> 01:00:23,760

with you hey thank you so much for

1478
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:31,000

1479
01:02:28,359 --> 01:02:33,000
it okay if I ask you yeah okay okay

1480
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:37,079
first question is will I heal my EMF

1481
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:38,599
sensitivity and if so how EMF EMF always

1482
01:02:37,079 --> 01:02:40,279
always heals when you when you do the

1483
01:02:38,599 --> 01:02:43,599
right things it always

1484
01:02:40,279 --> 01:02:46,240
heals okay people don't stay in EMF hell

1485
01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:48,480
forever if they do the right things okay

1486
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:50,680
so you have you have the information and

1487
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:53,760
EMF will heal what's the other question

1488
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:55,480
um so I created an affirmation card deck

1489
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:57,920
based off of the healing path Wellness

1490
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:59,160
step for that you taught us how to do

1491
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:02,119
and I was wondering if you would

1492
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:04,000
autograph my card de of course I would

1493
01:03:02,119 --> 01:03:06,440
and there's a card I just wanted to show

1494
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:08,960
you this one I can grab that back from

1495
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:11,079
you so I pair affirmations that you

1496
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:13,480
teach us with activities so people can

1497
01:03:11,079 --> 01:03:15,880
remember to do them regularly okay my

1498
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:18,559
favorite one is I work for God and you

1499
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:19,880
say it when you open a door or a window

1500
01:03:18,559 --> 01:03:22,680

I'm alive because it's a miracle and I

think angels and God kept me and the

1836
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:06,480
reason was that 7 months prior I started

region of some some goodies for you and

2036

your team okay good um and I wanted to

2037
01:27:20,679 --> 01:27:24,880
ask you if you have advice for somebody

2038
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:25,920
with type 1 diabetes that trying to heal

2039
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:27,840
and is a little bit afraid of the

2040
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:30,199
information with sugar spikes and how

2041
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:32,040
can they move forward and you're you're

2042
01:27:30,199 --> 01:27:33,520
reading the diabetes chapters and

2043
01:27:32,040 --> 01:27:35,440
everything so you got that inform I'm

2044
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:36,800
giving advice to that person but I'm

2045
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:38,520
just wondering if you know they feel

2046
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:40,040
like maybe it's it's hard for them to

2047
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:42,920
trust you know they've got their monitor

2048
01:27:40,040 --> 01:27:44,840
and it spikes and how do they how do

2049
01:27:42,920 --> 01:27:48,520
they use the information to heal and

2050
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:50,719
feel safe and it's it's it's about

2051
01:27:48,520 --> 01:27:52,480
having trust and faith and you just have

2052
01:27:50,719 --> 01:27:55,080
to kind of keep on working on them

2053
01:27:52,480 --> 01:27:58,000
there's some things that

2054
01:27:55,080 --> 01:28:02,000
are there's some things with individuals

2055
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:05,040
where if you can't break that wall down

2056
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:08,000
and crack that it's hard to get more and

2057
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:10,440
more of of the rest and so but you know

2058
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:12,280

soon I've been working on something

2189
01:33:54,440 --> 01:33:58,400
about that and I don't know if that fits

2190
01:33:56,639 --> 01:34:00,480
with curses where I come from people

2191
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:02,880
believe in that and it causes so much

2192
01:34:00,480 --> 01:34:05,760
fear so I don't know if that exists if

2193
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:08,080
it doesn't what exists curses curses

2194
01:34:05,760 --> 01:34:11,880
curses curs curses and

2195
01:34:08,080 --> 01:34:14,480
hexes um you know uh spirit of

2196
01:34:11,880 --> 01:34:16,880
compassion has told me that those aren't

2197
01:34:14,480 --> 01:34:19,639
things that really hold but there's

2198
01:34:16,880 --> 01:34:21,840
other things that cause trouble and I

2199
01:34:19,639 --> 01:34:23,400
think I have to start doing more about

2200
01:34:21,840 --> 01:34:24,280

2201
01:34:23,400 --> 01:34:27,840

01:43:46,360 --> 01:43:49,840
a meditation the temple was empty and we

were allowed you're not allowed to main

2408
01:43:49,840 --> 01:43:53,840
the temples but it was empty and I put

2409
01:43:52,159 --> 01:43:57,199
my hands against the wall and I

of me was this large L on fire and I the

2412

it wasn't a voice that I heard but it

2413
01:44:02,960 --> 01:44:08,639
was information I received from within

2414
01:44:04,880 --> 01:44:10,520
me after that experience was this

2415
01:44:08,639 --> 01:44:12,920

01:44:10,520 --> 01:44:14,280

so I do the work that I do which is not

2434
01:44:55,800 --> 01:45:00,239
fulfilling and I'm working for darkness

2435
01:44:57,840 --> 01:45:01,320
and to support my mm lifestyle and so

2436
01:45:00,239 --> 01:45:04,080
how do I

2437
01:45:01,320 --> 01:45:08,440

2438
01:45:04,080 --> 01:45:10,119

2441
01:45:11,880 --> 01:45:15,719
I don't want to work for pharmaceutical

2442
01:45:13,239 --> 01:45:15,719
Banking and

2443
01:45:16,320 --> 01:45:22,119
Telecommunications you just just don't

2444
01:45:19,320 --> 01:45:24,679
fight it there's probably some positives

2445
01:45:22,119 --> 01:45:26,760
out of it that there don't fight it and

2446
01:45:24,679 --> 01:45:29,400

are floating

2946
02:08:08,360 --> 02:08:14,559
around and getting rid of them over time

2947
02:08:11,800 --> 02:08:18,320
that means you need to keep

2948
02:08:14,559 --> 02:08:21,159
diligent chemical sensitivities heals it

done don't want to cry so I'll keep it

3048
02:13:56,599 --> 02:14:02,239
short but um you know from the moment

3049
02:13:59,320 --> 02:14:04,960
that the information the books literally

3050
02:14:02,239 --> 02:14:07,880
landed on my doorstep I mean mind blown

3051
02:14:04,960 --> 02:14:10,760
all on its own just divinely landed

3052
02:14:07,880 --> 02:14:12,239
there and how did you trust how did you

3053
02:14:10,760 --> 02:14:14,639
trust it was the

3054
02:14:12,239 --> 02:14:16,280
information and I know so many people in

3055
02:14:14,639 --> 02:14:19,679
the community can relate just reading

3056
02:14:16,280 --> 02:14:21,719
those words it's like that knowing

3057
02:14:19,679 --> 02:14:24,159
right and everything

3058
02:14:21,719 --> 02:14:27,159
and still blows my mind to think that is

3059
02:14:24,159 --> 02:14:29,800
just hanging around it blows my mind too

3060
02:14:27,159 --> 02:14:31,520
on a daily um and I mean I've talked

3061
02:14:29,800 --> 02:14:33,760
about it a little bit on social media

3062
02:14:31,520 --> 02:14:35,480
but it's it's really personal to me but

3063
02:14:33,760 --> 02:14:37,920
when I flipped the back and I saw your

3064
02:14:35,480 --> 02:14:40,599

3065
02:14:37,920 --> 02:14:42,760
like I knew you and I do have a kind of

3066
02:14:40,599 --> 02:14:45,079
understanding of what it is but like

3067
02:14:42,760 --> 02:14:47,760
your your essence was there and I could

3068
02:14:45,079 --> 02:14:49,719
feel it in the photo and I it felt like

3069
02:14:47,760 --> 02:14:51,440
I knew you and from that moment I just

3070
02:14:49,719 --> 02:14:53,360

02:53:37,880 --> 02:53:41,080
definitely that's not what I was

3567
02:53:38,960 --> 02:53:43,319
thinking but uh what I what I was

3568
02:53:41,080 --> 02:53:46,239
thinking is that you know as a as a chef

3569
02:53:43,319 --> 02:53:48,200
my job is to create food that will bring

3570
02:53:46,239 --> 02:53:50,840
in all kinds of people right and so it

3571
02:53:48,200 --> 02:53:52,880
was an interesting project to to use the

3572
02:53:50,840 --> 02:53:55,680
protocols of this of this you know way

3573
02:53:52,880 --> 02:53:58,279
of eating this this methodology and

3574
02:53:55,680 --> 02:54:00,160
incorporated into the food in a way that

3575
02:53:58,279 --> 02:54:01,800
not only would your community be

3576
02:54:00,160 --> 02:54:04,120
interested in in eating this food but

3577
02:54:01,800 --> 02:54:05,520
also the Cafe Gratitude community and

3578
02:54:04,120 --> 02:54:07,840
and people who are new to both

3579
02:54:05,520 --> 02:54:09,720
communities so that was the inspiration

3580
02:54:07,840 --> 02:54:11,920
to really sort of like H how can I make

3581
02:54:09,720 --> 02:54:13,120
this appealing to both sides of the

3582
02:54:11,920 --> 02:54:16,479
spectrum

3583
02:54:13,120 --> 02:54:20,319
so that is I really appreciate it we

3584
02:54:16,479 --> 02:54:20,319
appreciate it you guys right

3585
02:54:21,200 --> 02:54:25,239
and I actually I have another invitation

3586
02:54:23,319 --> 02:54:28,640
to everybody as well for for those of

3587
02:54:25,239 --> 02:54:31,720
you who know Cafe Gratitude uh we we

3588
02:54:28,640 --> 02:54:33,800
started in 2004 uh it was created by

3589
02:54:31,720 --> 02:54:35,520
Matthew and tery anglehart and what they

3590
02:54:33,800 --> 02:54:37,800
did at one point was decided that they

3591
02:54:35,520 --> 02:54:40,479
wanted to create a board game that

3592
02:54:37,800 --> 02:54:42,200
brought our attention to abundance and

3593
02:54:40,479 --> 02:54:44,000
gratitude so it was called the abounding

3594
02:54:42,200 --> 02:54:45,920
river board game and they created it and

3595
02:54:44,000 --> 02:54:47,399
then they decided why don't we create a

3596
02:54:45,920 --> 02:54:49,000
little raw food restaurant where people

3597
02:54:47,399 --> 02:54:51,040
can come and play that game and so

3598
02:54:49,000 --> 02:54:52,880
literally the the board game was the

3599
02:54:51,040 --> 02:54:54,399
tables and people would come in and it

3600
02:54:52,880 --> 02:54:56,200
was sort of like a Trivial Pursuit game

3601
02:54:54,399 --> 02:54:58,279
where you were ask you know certain

3602
02:54:56,200 --> 02:55:01,840
things about your life and about your

3603
02:54:58,279 --> 02:55:04,000
past and uh out of that evolved Cafe

3604
02:55:01,840 --> 02:55:06,000
Gratitude and our question of the day

3605
02:55:04,000 --> 02:55:09,520

3767
03:27:51,479 --> 03:27:56,800
with aw and we have just been having a

3768
03:27:54,000 --> 03:27:59,640
blast these past few nights aw I do have

3769
03:27:56,800 --> 03:28:01,239
to ask you why is medical medium it's

3770
03:27:59,640 --> 03:28:03,439
not a one-size fits-all can you talk

3771
03:28:01,239 --> 03:28:05,239
about that a bit Yeah in the health

3772
03:28:03,439 --> 03:28:07,680
world there's a lot of one siiz fits-all

3773
03:28:05,239 --> 03:28:11,279
that's how it works if someone believes

3774
03:28:07,680 --> 03:28:13,880
in one thing it's really restricted in

3775
03:28:11,279 --> 03:28:16,960
so many ways medical medium information

3776
03:28:13,880 --> 03:28:20,840
you could come in and you can can keep

3777
03:28:16,960 --> 03:28:23,000
all these Foods in there that you love

3778
03:28:20,840 --> 03:28:26,520
and do these and you can just take one

3779
03:28:23,000 --> 03:28:29,520
thing and start one thing only and

3780
03:28:26,520 --> 03:28:32,800
you're in it you're doing it and you can

3781
03:28:29,520 --> 03:28:35,120
customize and you can't customize in all

3782
03:28:32,800 --> 03:28:38,359
the other health Arenas but that keeps

3783
03:28:35,120 --> 03:28:40,199
the healing aspect down low you know so

3784
03:28:38,359 --> 03:28:42,040
what happens in the health world is

3785
03:28:40,199 --> 03:28:44,279
because it's one size fits all and all

3786
03:28:42,040 --> 03:28:46,120
these different Trends and diets and all

3787
03:28:44,279 --> 03:28:48,520
that and they make it look like it's not

3788
03:28:46,120 --> 03:28:51,279
one size pit all but it is and when you

3789
03:28:48,520 --> 03:28:53,560
scratch the surface sure you get one out

3790
03:28:51,279 --> 03:28:56,439
of a 100 people that start healing and

3791
03:28:53,560 --> 03:28:59,600
they Harald that as it's the Holy Grail

3792
03:28:56,439 --> 03:29:03,439
how about getting 99 out of 100 better

3793
03:28:59,600 --> 03:29:06,840
fast how about getting 100 people healed

3794
03:29:03,439 --> 03:29:09,680
a th000 people healed a million people

3795
03:29:06,840 --> 03:29:12,760
healed and it takes something that's not

3796
03:29:09,680 --> 03:29:14,760
on size fits all to heal a million

3797
03:29:12,760 --> 03:29:18,399
people like in the medical media

3798
03:29:14,760 --> 03:29:20,319
movement it takes it takes a lot of

3799
03:29:18,399 --> 03:29:22,720
different aspects different things in

3800
03:29:20,319 --> 03:29:24,800
order for that to happen and one is you

3801
03:29:22,720 --> 03:29:27,359
got to be able to customize you got to

3802
03:29:24,800 --> 03:29:29,880
be able to take the information to your

3803
03:29:27,359 --> 03:29:32,199
doctor and ask questions and have them

3804
03:29:29,880 --> 03:29:35,760
look at it because it's complex it's

3805
03:29:32,199 --> 03:29:38,319
medical information that's Advanced so

3806
03:29:35,760 --> 03:29:41,520
people can just take it to someone if

3807
03:29:38,319 --> 03:29:43,600
they want and they can customize it they

3808
03:29:41,520 --> 03:29:46,920

they need to it's for every everybody

3810
03:29:46,920 --> 03:29:53,399

Millions heal on medical medium fact

3812
03:29:53,399 --> 03:29:58,319
just fact and that's the street cred

03:30:32,600 --> 03:30:37,560
hearing this over the past few nights

3832
03:30:34,399 --> 03:30:39,080
have just been incredible what is it

3833
03:30:37,560 --> 03:30:41,680
about medical medium food that's

3834
03:30:39,080 --> 03:30:44,120
different from other healthy food well a

3835
03:30:41,680 --> 03:30:46,600
lot of things are labeled healthy food

3836
03:30:44,120 --> 03:30:50,199
and over the years all the this garbage

3837
03:30:46,600 --> 03:30:52,439
was in so-called healthy food medical M

3838
03:30:50,199 --> 03:30:56,080
was Advanced information called the

03:30:52,439 --> 03:31:00,239
shots on natural flavors being toxic

3840
03:30:56,080 --> 03:31:03,319
called the shot on organic flavoring

3841
03:31:00,239 --> 03:31:05,880
organic natural flavoring being toxic

3842
03:31:03,319 --> 03:31:08,399
any kind of flavoring is toxic and so

3843
03:31:05,880 --> 03:31:10,640

3844
03:31:08,399 --> 03:31:13,479

e e

4139
04:15:24,800 --> 04:15:29,119
all right I think we can do

4140
04:15:27,600 --> 04:15:33,760
this

4141
04:15:29,119 --> 04:15:33,760
hey good to see you guys

4142
04:15:40,290 --> 04:15:45,560
[Applause]

4143
04:15:43,960 --> 04:15:50,020
you ready for a little

4144
04:15:45,560 --> 04:15:50,020
[Applause]

4145
04:15:52,279 --> 04:15:58,479
talk you can have eyes and they can see

4146
04:15:55,840 --> 04:16:02,880
fine

4147
04:15:58,479 --> 04:16:05,600
right and everything looks

4148
04:16:02,880 --> 04:16:07,640
good but yet there could be a fog and

4149
04:16:05,600 --> 04:16:11,040
that fog is what a lot of you guys have

4150
04:16:07,640 --> 04:16:13,279
been through which is the health

4151
04:16:11,040 --> 04:16:17,760
movement and the medical system system

4152
04:16:13,279 --> 04:16:17,760
too not forget that there's some fog in

4153
04:16:18,159 --> 04:16:25,080
there and you got good eyes you can see

4154
04:16:23,199 --> 04:16:29,239
but all these things are

4155
04:16:25,080 --> 04:16:33,520
there and they become this thick

4156
04:16:29,239 --> 04:16:36,199
fog all the different Trends all of it

4157
04:16:33,520 --> 04:16:38,199
everything from what

4158
04:16:36,199 --> 04:16:42,080
charcoal

4159
04:16:38,199 --> 04:16:44,640
colostrum list goes on right I can name

4160
04:16:42,080 --> 04:16:47,080
off a hundred things

4161
04:16:44,640 --> 04:16:51,479
but we'll just talk about some other

4162
04:16:47,080 --> 04:16:54,960
things too but it becomes like this fog

4163
04:16:51,479 --> 04:16:57,560
that gets in the way and maybe that's no

4164
04:16:54,960 --> 04:17:00,000
big deal for someone who feels

4165
04:16:57,560 --> 04:17:02,319
fine maybe no big deal at all for

4166
04:17:00,000 --> 04:17:03,479
somebody who just maybe needs to drop a

4167
04:17:02,319 --> 04:17:06,080
couple of

4168
04:17:03,479 --> 04:17:08,159
pounds maybe feel less

4169
04:17:06,080 --> 04:17:11,840
sluggish but when you're somebody that's

4170
04:17:08,159 --> 04:17:13,479
been really sick and really struggled

4171
04:17:11,840 --> 04:17:17,279
for a long time

4172
04:17:13,479 --> 04:17:18,920
30 years 20 years 5 years 6 months 6

4173
04:17:17,279 --> 04:17:20,840
months can be a long

4174
04:17:18,920 --> 04:17:23,560
time that

4175
04:17:20,840 --> 04:17:25,560
fog can seem death

4176
04:17:23,560 --> 04:17:27,920
defying it could

4177
04:17:25,560 --> 04:17:30,840
seem

4178
04:17:27,920 --> 04:17:34,479
depressing something that holds you

4179
04:17:30,840 --> 04:17:37,119
back you got eyes and you can see and

4180
04:17:34,479 --> 04:17:40,040
you could see fine but that fog can

4181
04:17:37,119 --> 04:17:43,520
really get in the way over time and

4182
04:17:40,040 --> 04:17:45,399
maybe you guys experience this

4183
04:17:43,520 --> 04:17:48,040
so when you're chronically sick and

4184
04:17:45,399 --> 04:17:51,159
you've struggled for a while in your

4185
04:17:48,040 --> 04:17:52,920
life it becomes like doors that end up

4186
04:17:51,159 --> 04:17:56,119
closing on

4187
04:17:52,920 --> 04:17:57,680
you it becomes a lot of confusion it's

4188
04:17:56,119 --> 04:18:00,439
easy to get

4189
04:17:57,680 --> 04:18:02,960
lost and I was told about that when I

4190
04:18:00,439 --> 04:18:06,080
was young and I was a

4191
04:18:02,960 --> 04:18:08,439
kid was told about that from Spirit of

4192
04:18:06,080 --> 04:18:12,920
compassion because all I wanted to do

4193
04:18:08,439 --> 04:18:15,600
was just go fishing in a pond ride my b

4194
04:18:12,920 --> 04:18:19,040
icle hop on my

4195
04:18:15,600 --> 04:18:21,119
skateboard that's all I wanted to do

4196
04:18:19,040 --> 04:18:23,560
also go in nature too as

4197
04:18:21,119 --> 04:18:25,439
well but Spirit of compassion would say

4198
04:18:23,560 --> 04:18:27,000
well we have bigger things to do we have

4199
04:18:25,439 --> 04:18:28,960
more important things to do there's a

4200
04:18:27,000 --> 04:18:31,159
lot of people out there that need

4201
04:18:28,960 --> 04:18:34,600
something and you know when you're six

4202
04:18:31,159 --> 04:18:38,199
seven years old 8 years old that becomes

4203
04:18:34,600 --> 04:18:41,840
a strange sound strange sound in your

4204
04:18:38,199 --> 04:18:44,600
ear cuz it really doesn't make sense

4205
04:18:41,840 --> 04:18:47,399
like what do people need what does it

4206
04:18:44,600 --> 04:18:49,359
matter and spirit of compassion told me

4207
04:18:47,399 --> 04:18:51,119
that someday there's going to be a lot

4208
04:18:49,359 --> 04:18:53,239
of people out there they're going to be

4209
04:18:51,119 --> 04:18:55,040
very sick they're going to be lost

4210
04:18:53,239 --> 04:18:57,199
they're going to be in a fog and you're

4211
04:18:55,040 --> 04:18:59,520
going to have to help them see

4212
04:18:57,199 --> 04:19:01,359
differently you have to help them see

4213
04:18:59,520 --> 04:19:04,399
things that actually can change their

4214
04:19:01,359 --> 04:19:06,840
lives move them out of that Darkness out

4215
04:19:04,399 --> 04:19:08,640
of that fog into the light of healing I

4216
04:19:06,840 --> 04:19:12,040
heard that when I was seven eight years

4217
04:19:08,640 --> 04:19:14,800
old and it was the most foreign strange

4218
04:19:12,040 --> 04:19:17,119
words I've ever could imagin to hear at

4219
04:19:14,800 --> 04:19:20,560
7 years

4220
04:19:17,119 --> 04:19:22,960
old it took a little while to care

4221
04:19:20,560 --> 04:19:28,000
because I didn't want to

4222
04:19:22,960 --> 04:19:31,199
care I cared about animals I cared about

4223
04:19:28,000 --> 04:19:33,119
birds with a broken wing I cared about

4224
04:19:31,199 --> 04:19:36,319
frogs with a broken

4225
04:19:33,119 --> 04:19:39,319
leg I cared about

4226
04:19:36,319 --> 04:19:41,800
caterpillars

4227
04:19:39,319 --> 04:19:44,840
dragonflies I would get so sad when a

4228
04:19:41,800 --> 04:19:47,640
dragonfly seemed weak and something was

4229
04:19:44,840 --> 04:19:49,800
wrong I would try to give it water and

4230
04:19:47,640 --> 04:19:53,840
revive

4231
04:19:49,800 --> 04:19:54,960
it and what happens along the way when

4232
04:19:53,840 --> 04:19:57,600
you're young like that and you're

4233
04:19:54,960 --> 04:20:00,560
hearing this information you want to

4234
04:19:57,600 --> 04:20:03,080
kind of avoid it but Spirit of

4235
04:20:00,560 --> 04:20:06,600
compassion said you have to care with

4236
04:20:03,080 --> 04:20:08,800
everything you have you have to care and

4237
04:20:06,600 --> 04:20:11,800
so I did everything I could to reach

4238
04:20:08,800 --> 04:20:14,760
deep when I was young and spirit of

4239
04:20:11,800 --> 04:20:17,920
compassion said the same way you care

4240
04:20:14,760 --> 04:20:23,119
about animals and the same way you care

4241
04:20:17,920 --> 04:20:27,479
about dogs and cats and birds and

4242
04:20:23,119 --> 04:20:30,479
turtles you have to care about people so

4243
04:20:27,479 --> 04:20:32,319
it's 7 years old I was like okay okay

4244
04:20:30,479 --> 04:20:34,800
I'm getting the hang of this I have to

4245
04:20:32,319 --> 04:20:37,920
care about people I have to see what's

4246
04:20:34,800 --> 04:20:40,479
going on and I wasn't

4247
04:20:37,920 --> 04:20:42,880
sick and I say it all the time unless

4248
04:20:40,479 --> 04:20:46,319
you've been sick and walk in someone 's

4249
04:20:42,880 --> 04:20:49,520
shoes will you ever know what it feels

4250
04:20:46,319 --> 04:20:51,920
like being that I wasn't sick that was

4251
04:20:49,520 --> 04:20:53,680
the next Hill to climb for me because

4252
04:20:51,920 --> 04:20:55,800
Spirit of compassion said somehow

4253
04:20:53,680 --> 04:20:58,239
someway you have to know what it feels

4254
04:20:55,800 --> 04:21:00,840
like you're going to have to experience

4255
04:20:58,239 --> 04:21:01,920
it in your Consciousness in some way

4256
04:21:00,840 --> 04:21:04,560
you're going to have to make that

4257
04:21:01,920 --> 04:21:06,319
connection to someone suffering just

4258
04:21:04,560 --> 04:21:08,640
because you're not there and you haven't

4259
04:21:06,319 --> 04:21:11,239
suffered like that

4260
04:21:08,640 --> 04:21:14,880
physically at a young age doesn't mean

4261
04:21:11,239 --> 04:21:17,319
you can't connect and make that

4262
04:21:14,880 --> 04:21:20,040
connection I remember seeing a wounded

4263
04:21:17,319 --> 04:21:23,000
turtle that was hit by a car it was

4264
04:21:20,040 --> 04:21:24,960
still alive when I was young I did

4265
04:21:23,000 --> 04:21:29,720
everything I could to save it I couldn't

4266
04:21:24,960 --> 04:21:29,720
save it was too injured shell was just

4267
04:21:30,760 --> 04:21:36,720
fractured it was weak and weakening fast

4268
04:21:34,920 --> 04:21:38,520
but I did everything I could and I beg

4269
04:21:36,720 --> 04:21:40,479
Spirit of compassion to send down light

4270
04:21:38,520 --> 04:21:43,439
and I sent that light with Spirit of

4271
04:21:40,479 --> 04:21:45,920
compassion into that turtle through me

4272
04:21:43,439 --> 04:21:49,279
and also to the turtle

4273
04:21:45,920 --> 04:21:51,880
direct just like the light blast and we

4274
04:21:49,279 --> 04:21:54,920
kept that turtle alive for as long as we

4275
04:21:51,880 --> 04:21:56,600
could as long as we could a lot longer

4276
04:21:54,920 --> 04:21:58,399
than it ever would have because it

4277
04:21:56,600 --> 04:22:02,720
should have passed probably within a

4278
04:21:58,399 --> 04:22:02,720
half an hour and it was alive for

4279
04:22:02,840 --> 04:22:08,479
weeks but that Turtle still passed away

4280
04:22:06,239 --> 04:22:11,479
because it was run over by a car so

4281
04:22:08,479 --> 04:22:14,960
badly but that was the moment right

4282
04:22:11,479 --> 04:22:18,720
there when I was like okay I'm awakened

4283
04:22:14,960 --> 04:22:20,720
I'm awakened we have to save people we

4284
04:22:18,720 --> 04:22:23,520
have to keep them alive we have to

4285
04:22:20,720 --> 04:22:25,800
recover them we have to bring them back

4286
04:22:23,520 --> 04:22:28,119
no matter what happens we need to do

4287
04:22:25,800 --> 04:22:32,159
that and at 7 years old I made the

4288
04:22:28,119 --> 04:22:32,159
connection and that's when I was

4289
04:22:33,640 --> 04:22:40,159
reborn I wasn't the same person as I was

4290
04:22:36,880 --> 04:22:44,080
when I was 4 years old or 5 years old or

4291
04:22:40,159 --> 04:22:46,800
one it was a rebirthing for for me to

4292
04:22:44,080 --> 04:22:49,359
make the connection to somebody who is

4293
04:22:46,800 --> 04:22:52,920
suffering and struggling but that was

4294
04:22:49,359 --> 04:22:57,319
that level now that I had to meet up to

4295
04:22:52,920 --> 04:22:59,680
which means I had to now live with that

4296
04:22:57,319 --> 04:23:02,520
that means that all through my days it's

4297
04:22:59,680 --> 04:23:04,840
all I thought about it took over my mind

4298
04:23:02,520 --> 04:23:06,640
my Consciousness and every time I had a

4299
04:23:04,840 --> 04:23:08,840
hard time with it about suffering in

4300
04:23:06,640 --> 04:23:11,399
people suffering as Spirit of compassion

4301
04:23:08,840 --> 04:23:14,880
was telling me this person has brain fog

4302
04:23:11,399 --> 04:23:18,239
and the term brain fog didn't

4303
04:23:14,880 --> 04:23:18,239
exist didn't

4304
04:23:18,279 --> 04:23:23,399
exist this person has neurological Lyme

4305
04:23:21,040 --> 04:23:25,960
disease did not

4306
04:23:23,399 --> 04:23:28,159
exist this person has this this person

4307
04:23:25,960 --> 04:23:30,199
has that it didn't exist hearing these

4308
04:23:28,159 --> 04:23:32,720
words hearing what was wrong with people

4309
04:23:30,199 --> 04:23:35,119
then connecting that to the suffering

4310
04:23:32,720 --> 04:23:37,800
and remembering about that turtle that

4311
04:23:35,119 --> 04:23:39,040
was suffering and making that connection

4312
04:23:37,800 --> 04:23:40,960
probably one of the most difficult

4313
04:23:39,040 --> 04:23:44,000
things in my

4314
04:23:40,960 --> 04:23:45,840
life but I had to get over these humps

4315
04:23:44,000 --> 04:23:49,479
and I had to live with it I would go out

4316
04:23:45,840 --> 04:23:53,279
into the woods when I was younger

4317
04:23:49,479 --> 04:23:57,040
alone I would sit out there and fall

4318
04:23:53,279 --> 04:23:59,640
asleep on the ground next to a little

4319
04:23:57,040 --> 04:24:01,920
campfire some rocks I would have there

4320
04:23:59,640 --> 04:24:05,960
that got really hot with the fire around

4321
04:24:01,920 --> 04:24:09,279
it and I would every time I heard some

4322
04:24:05,960 --> 04:24:10,920
twig snap or break I would say the

4323
04:24:09,279 --> 04:24:15,840
spirit of compassion

4324
04:24:10,920 --> 04:24:15,840
Sasquatch Spirit of as would say no no

4325
04:24:20,119 --> 04:24:23,920
Sasquatch a frog a

4326
04:24:24,000 --> 04:24:30,760
toad but I would be in nature and I had

4327
04:24:27,000 --> 04:24:34,279
to be there to decompress at a young age

4328
04:24:30,760 --> 04:24:36,720
to lift off that pain and suffering in

4329
04:24:34,279 --> 04:24:38,560
the moments because I was taking it on I

4330
04:24:36,720 --> 04:24:41,359
took it on at a young age people's pain

4331
04:24:38,560 --> 04:24:43,760
and suffering and it would fester and I

4332
04:24:41,359 --> 04:24:45,960
had to learn how to cycle it through

4333
04:24:43,760 --> 04:24:49,970
learn how to understand it learn how to

4334
04:24:45,960 --> 04:24:51,720
process it and guess what nobody

4335
04:24:49,970 --> 04:24:54,080
[Music]

4336
04:24:51,720 --> 04:24:57,199
cared nobody

4337
04:24:54,080 --> 04:25:00,040
cared my parents did but nobody in the

4338
04:24:57,199 --> 04:25:01,520
world cared they don't care about the

4339
04:25:00,040 --> 04:25:03,399
chronically ill and I learned that at a

4340
04:25:01,520 --> 04:25:06,040
young age nobody cared about the

4341
04:25:03,399 --> 04:25:09,399
chronically sick oh my God if you've

4342
04:25:06,040 --> 04:25:11,680
been sick for 30 years or 30 years ago

4343
04:25:09,399 --> 04:25:14,399
you know they care now because it's

4344
04:25:11,680 --> 04:25:15,720
clicks and likes and all that [ __ ]

4345
04:25:14,399 --> 04:25:17,600
and then sell whatever you're going to

4346
04:25:15,720 --> 04:25:20,560
sell to the chronically sick because

4347
04:25:17,600 --> 04:25:22,399
boom cha-ching cha-ching the industry

4348
04:25:20,560 --> 04:25:25,560
changed completely

4349
04:25:22,399 --> 04:25:27,960
now but back then nobody even cared

4350
04:25:25,560 --> 04:25:32,560
about anything with the chronic Leo so

4351
04:25:27,960 --> 04:25:36,680
here I was young a child okay I care I

4352
04:25:32,560 --> 04:25:39,239
feel it I understand it nobody

4353
04:25:36,680 --> 04:25:41,760
cares and then I hear this

4354
04:25:39,239 --> 04:25:44,399
voice that's teaching me all these

4355
04:25:41,760 --> 04:25:46,279
different things things about why people

4356
04:25:44,399 --> 04:25:48,760
are sick

4357
04:25:46,279 --> 04:25:50,840
and and then the connection about

4358
04:25:48,760 --> 04:25:53,479
suffering and struggling and then

4359
04:25:50,840 --> 04:25:55,960
realizing just like I heard tonight

4360
04:25:53,479 --> 04:25:59,760
someone's driving now who couldn't drive

4361
04:25:55,960 --> 04:26:04,119
before that simple little thing how

4362
04:25:59,760 --> 04:26:08,399
important that is losing that freedom to

4363
04:26:04,119 --> 04:26:10,479
drive losing the freedom to even talk so

4364
04:26:08,399 --> 04:26:13,439
many people have been

4365
04:26:10,479 --> 04:26:15,239
there and then connect to that

4366
04:26:13,439 --> 04:26:17,960
understanding that my job all these

4367
04:26:15,239 --> 04:26:20,159
years has been you have to know what

4368
04:26:17,960 --> 04:26:21,840
that's like in some way you have to

4369
04:26:20,159 --> 04:26:23,680
understand it it can't be just words

4370
04:26:21,840 --> 04:26:25,600
from Spirit of compassion I have to

4371
04:26:23,680 --> 04:26:27,960
connect with it and that's what drives

4372
04:26:25,600 --> 04:26:30,359
me that's how I get up in the morning

4373
04:26:27,960 --> 04:26:33,920
and that's what drives me every single

4374
04:26:30,359 --> 04:26:36,319
day my life has passed by like this like

4375
04:26:33,920 --> 04:26:38,000
that because the spirit of compassion

4376
04:26:36,319 --> 04:26:40,119
all I've heard is a bunch of scrambled

4377
04:26:38,000 --> 04:26:41,800
eggs going into my ear about every

4378
04:26:40,119 --> 04:26:44,359
illness and every symptom and every

4379
04:26:41,800 --> 04:26:46,880
disease and everything else and it's

4380
04:26:44,359 --> 04:26:47,880
made my life kind of go by like this but

4381
04:26:46,880 --> 04:26:51,520
guess

4382
04:26:47,880 --> 04:26:55,320
what it was worth

4383
04:26:51,520 --> 04:26:58,570
it how many people

4384
04:26:55,320 --> 04:26:58,570
[Applause]

4385
04:26:59,000 --> 04:27:03,960
healed how many people healed how many

4386
04:27:01,680 --> 04:27:05,880
people recovered throughout the years

4387
04:27:03,960 --> 04:27:09,960
the fact that we're in here in Cafe

4388
04:27:05,880 --> 04:27:11,880
Gratitude in La blows my mind all on its

4389
04:27:09,960 --> 04:27:14,159
own I can't even believe it can't

4390
04:27:11,880 --> 04:27:14,159
believe

4391
04:27:17,680 --> 04:27:21,399
it you know I've talked about three

4392
04:27:19,920 --> 04:27:23,119
steps up you guys have heard that from

4393
04:27:21,399 --> 04:27:26,720
me probably broken record there he goes

4394
04:27:23,119 --> 04:27:29,239
three steps up two steps back right what

4395
04:27:26,720 --> 04:27:31,640
does it even mean right you ever think

4396
04:27:29,239 --> 04:27:34,399
about that you guys know what it means

4397
04:27:31,640 --> 04:27:35,840
though right you're moving forward

4398
04:27:34,399 --> 04:27:37,840
you're moving forward then you're kicked

4399
04:27:35,840 --> 04:27:41,319
back a little bit scared

4400
04:27:37,840 --> 04:27:43,479
[ __ ] scared [ __ ] you get kick backed a

4401
04:27:41,319 --> 04:27:45,920
little bit and then but but you're

4402
04:27:43,479 --> 04:27:48,920
further than you were you're further

4403
04:27:45,920 --> 04:27:50,319
than you were with your symptoms how

4404
04:27:48,920 --> 04:27:55,800
powerful is

4405
04:27:50,319 --> 04:27:55,800
that the healing process is exactly

4406
04:27:55,840 --> 04:28:00,520
that

4407
04:27:57,399 --> 04:28:03,439
it's a few steps forward one step back a

4408
04:28:00,520 --> 04:28:05,840
few steps forward two steps back that's

4409
04:28:03,439 --> 04:28:09,119
how it works when you heal even if it

4410
04:28:05,840 --> 04:28:14,119
doesn't feel that way sometimes you are

4411
04:28:09,119 --> 04:28:14,119
still healing you are still healing

4412
04:28:16,000 --> 04:28:20,640
I think one of the problems in the

4413
04:28:18,119 --> 04:28:23,199
Natural Health world right now to this

4414
04:28:20,640 --> 04:28:25,800
day right this second is they still

4415
04:28:23,199 --> 04:28:27,680
don't know why anybody's sick I hear it

4416
04:28:25,800 --> 04:28:30,520
every day out there this person knows

4417
04:28:27,680 --> 04:28:32,680
this this expert knows this this person

4418
04:28:30,520 --> 04:28:34,439
knows this this professional knows this

4419
04:28:32,680 --> 04:28:37,080
but at the same time none of them know

4420
04:28:34,439 --> 04:28:38,720
why anybody was sick what happened when

4421
04:28:37,080 --> 04:28:40,640
you found out why you were sick did

4422
04:28:38,720 --> 04:28:42,199
anybody in here find out why you were

4423
04:28:40,640 --> 04:28:44,800
sick

4424
04:28:42,199 --> 04:28:44,800
ever find out

4425
04:28:50,080 --> 04:28:56,479
why when you find out why you became

4426
04:28:53,600 --> 04:28:58,560
sick it's half the battle I talk about

4427
04:28:56,479 --> 04:29:01,439
that the other half is now just doing

4428
04:28:58,560 --> 04:29:04,520
the right tools and moving forward right

4429
04:29:01,439 --> 04:29:07,000
and and doing that and

4430
04:29:04,520 --> 04:29:09,199
healing the world of chronic illness in

4431
04:29:07,000 --> 04:29:12,560
the world of natural health is

4432
04:29:09,199 --> 04:29:14,640
still still in the Dark Ages

4433
04:29:12,560 --> 04:29:17,600
still in the Dark

4434
04:29:14,640 --> 04:29:19,479
Ages and when you find any kind of

4435
04:29:17,600 --> 04:29:21,479
resistance out there towards medical

4436
04:29:19,479 --> 04:29:23,560
medium information like

4437
04:29:21,479 --> 04:29:26,359
censorship and

4438
04:29:23,560 --> 04:29:28,279
social not a lot of comment here not a

4439
04:29:26,359 --> 04:29:30,680
lot of comment here getting kicked off

4440
04:29:28,279 --> 04:29:32,399
of here whatever it is means you're in

4441
04:29:30,680 --> 04:29:33,180
the right place and you're doing the

4442
04:29:32,399 --> 04:29:36,319
right

4443
04:29:33,180 --> 04:29:36,319
[Music]

4444
04:29:39,520 --> 04:29:45,439
thing because we're Advan ened

4445
04:29:42,680 --> 04:29:49,040
information is what we

4446
04:29:45,439 --> 04:29:50,520
are it's not what people think it's the

4447
04:29:49,040 --> 04:29:52,119
opposite of what's happening out there

4448
04:29:50,520 --> 04:29:55,720
it's the advanced

4449
04:29:52,119 --> 04:29:58,720
information is what it is and that's why

4450
04:29:55,720 --> 04:30:00,479
sometimes it can feel like my God am I

4451
04:29:58,720 --> 04:30:02,840
the only one doing this medical medium

4452
04:30:00,479 --> 04:30:04,880
stuff oh my God why is everybody on my

4453
04:30:02,840 --> 04:30:06,560

doing this why are you doing

4456
04:30:09,239 --> 04:30:15,880
that but it's Advanced it's a ahead of

4457
04:30:12,319 --> 04:30:18,880
its time it still is it's Timeless it's

down the

4461
04:30:23,680 --> 04:30:29,119
road you guys are going to be like I was

4462
04:30:26,000 --> 04:30:33,199
doing that already I already

4463
04:30:29,119 --> 04:30:35,680
knew it's going to piss you

4464
04:30:33,199 --> 04:30:37,720
off especially when little tidbits are

4465
04:30:35,680 --> 04:30:41,159
being poached left and

4466
04:30:37,720 --> 04:30:43,920
right you already knew you're already

4467
04:30:41,159 --> 04:30:43,920
doing it

4468
04:30:45,640 --> 04:30:50,760
every

4469
04:30:47,159 --> 04:30:54,319
time you bump into a

4470
04:30:50,760 --> 04:31:00,880
wall and you think Justice isn't there

4471
04:30:54,319 --> 04:31:00,880
or you're not being heard God hears God

4472
04:31:02,720 --> 04:31:09,159
knows how many of you guys have had dogs

4473
04:31:05,640 --> 04:31:09,159
and cats that have passed

4474
04:31:10,640 --> 04:31:15,439
away how many many of you got dogs and

4475
04:31:13,040 --> 04:31:15,439
cats

4476
04:31:17,080 --> 04:31:22,040
now

4477
04:31:18,960 --> 04:31:24,080
someone back there on the red carpet

4478
04:31:22,040 --> 04:31:26,760
talked about that are we going to see

4479
04:31:24,080 --> 04:31:28,279
our dogs are we going to see our cats

4480
04:31:26,760 --> 04:31:30,840
are we going to see our pets when we

4481
04:31:28,279 --> 04:31:33,680
leave here 100 years from now 80 years

4482
04:31:30,840 --> 04:31:35,399
from now whenever it is and yes we are

4483
04:31:33,680 --> 04:31:38,399
they're going to be

4484
04:31:35,399 --> 04:31:41,119
waiting now I can say that not as a

4485
04:31:38,399 --> 04:31:43,760
psychic that's just saying it because

4486
04:31:41,119 --> 04:31:46,119
people want to hear it or

4487
04:31:43,760 --> 04:31:48,479
something Spirit of compassion told me

4488

yesterday I think it was and spirit of

4542
04:34:07,520 --> 04:34:11,330
compassion was talking about time and

4543
04:34:09,240 --> 04:34:13,000
how time works

4544
04:34:11,330 --> 04:34:14,639
[Music]

4545
04:34:13,000 --> 04:34:17,039
and how we're up against the restraints

4546
04:34:14,639 --> 04:34:21,160
of time and how we're under the law of

4547
04:34:17,039 --> 04:34:24,359
time and the rule the rule of time and

4548
04:34:21,160 --> 04:34:27,080
we're always faced with that all the

4549
04:34:24,359 --> 04:34:30,240
time there's a couple things I didn't

4550
04:34:27,080 --> 04:34:34,520
talk about though in that

4551
04:34:30,240 --> 04:34:39,600
moment is that any day you lost

4552
04:34:34,520 --> 04:34:42,520
here on this Earth because you lost it

4553
04:34:39,600 --> 04:34:44,920

04:34:44,920 --> 04:34:50,439
tend to your health or someone else

4556
04:34:47,400 --> 04:34:52,240
every day and every hour you lost comes

4557
04:34:50,439 --> 04:34:57,000

calculated it's added up by the angels

4562
04:35:07,600 --> 04:35:13,840
and by Supernatural

4563
04:35:10,279 --> 04:35:18,279
forces because the time you lost was of

4564
04:35:13,840 --> 04:35:20,240

4568
04:35:24,879 --> 04:35:30,240
sick hours of feeling like maybe you're

4569
04:35:27,799 --> 04:35:32,400
hopeless and you don't have the right

4570
04:35:30,240 --> 04:35:35,039
healing information no one understands

4571
04:35:32,400 --> 04:35:40,080
you you're not validated hours of all

4572
04:35:35,039 --> 04:35:40,080
those hours are protected by

4573
04:35:40,639 --> 04:35:46,719
God and they're placed aside and they're

4574
04:35:44,240 --> 04:35:49,680
gifted back to you at some point either

4575
04:35:46,719 --> 04:35:52,760

04:36:22,000 --> 04:36:28,039
existence it's not a throwaway it's not

4585
04:36:25,039 --> 04:36:30,199

and it's going to be a big

4642
04:39:15,719 --> 04:39:21,439
one I was sitting on the bench in the

4643
04:39:18,039 --> 04:39:24,320
back over there

4644
04:39:21,439 --> 04:39:27,760
relaxing talking to Spirit of

4645
04:39:24,320 --> 04:39:29,760

4646
04:39:27,760 --> 04:39:33,439
of readings tonight a lot of information

4647
04:39:29,760 --> 04:39:35,680
came through can you just give me a few

4648
04:39:33,439 --> 04:39:39,000
seconds because this light blast I know

4649
04:39:35,680 --> 04:39:42,080
is going to be really powerful really

4650
04:39:39,000 --> 04:39:45,000
big it's worth it for me to be laying on

4651
04:39:42,080 --> 04:39:46,958
the bench afterwards for a few minutes

4652
04:39:45,000 --> 04:39:49,120
way worth it wouldn't trade it in for

4653
04:39:46,958 --> 04:39:49,120
the

4654
04:39:58,280 --> 04:40:02,160
world tonight's light blast is going to

4655
04:40:00,560 --> 04:40:05,000
be similar to last night where you can

4656
04:40:02,160 --> 04:40:07,040
split the light if you need to some of

4657
04:40:05,000 --> 04:40:09,560
you probably remember that you can split

4658
04:40:07,040 --> 04:40:12,200
the light send some of the light to

4659
04:40:09,560 --> 04:40:15,240
somebody else

4660
04:40:12,200 --> 04:40:18,920
send some of the light to an

4661
04:40:15,240 --> 04:40:21,920
animal send some of the light to anybody

4662
04:40:18,920 --> 04:40:25,000
you want to and then keep the other side

4663
04:40:21,920 --> 04:40:26,878
also you don't have to do that the light

4664
04:40:25,000 --> 04:40:29,400
that's coming down tonight similar to

4665
04:40:26,878 --> 04:40:34,240
the light that came down last night and

4666
04:40:29,400 --> 04:40:37,080
it holds within you for a longer time

4667
04:40:34,240 --> 04:40:40,000
but more than that you'll be able to

4668
04:40:37,080 --> 04:40:42,638

contest the deepest breath doesn't

4700
04:42:33,040 --> 04:42:38,080
not but the words from SSC sound very

4701
04:42:36,360 --> 04:42:41,280
odd and it's

4702
04:42:38,080 --> 04:42:44,200
a very strange

4703
04:42:41,280 --> 04:42:44,200

4815
04:49:06,600 --> 04:49:13,480
little harsh or tough or a stretch but

4816
04:49:10,360 --> 04:49:16,120
it's true true it's true anybody in the

4817
04:49:13,480 --> 04:49:18,040

4818
04:49:16,120 --> 04:49:21,280
know the

4819
04:49:18,040 --> 04:49:22,760
difference and they know the people that

4820
04:49:21,280 --> 04:49:25,320

4821
04:49:22,760 --> 04:49:25,320
people they're

4822
04:49:27,440 --> 04:49:32,600

4823
04:49:30,240 --> 04:49:34,480

4824
04:49:32,600 --> 04:49:38,240

04:59:05,600 --> 04:59:08,520
and that's healing as well with medical

5033
04:59:07,040 --> 04:59:12,840
medium and his prescription has gone

5034
04:59:08,520 --> 04:59:15,600
from plus 4.5 to plus two that's huge

5035
04:59:12,840 --> 04:59:17,160

5036
04:59:15,600 --> 04:59:19,120
benefits have you found from doing the

5037
04:59:17,160 --> 04:59:22,160
medical medium protocol so I found

5038
04:59:19,120 --> 04:59:24,280
medical medium uh in 2021 and I was

5039
04:59:22,160 --> 04:59:27,440
super desperate I had all the kinds of

5040
04:59:24,280 --> 04:59:29,240
neurological problems adrenal fatigue my

5041
04:59:27,440 --> 04:59:31,878
family was tired of me saying I don't

5042
04:59:29,240 --> 04:59:33,600
feel well I don't feel well what's going

5043
04:59:31,878 --> 04:59:35,320
on with my health so I went Doctor

5044
04:59:33,600 --> 04:59:38,520
shopping doctor to doctor trying to

5045
04:59:35,320 --> 04:59:40,840
figure out what was going on um MRI came

5046
04:59:38,520 --> 04:59:42,440
back clean we couldn't fig figure out

5047
04:59:40,840 --> 04:59:45,638
anything and then I went to a naturopath

5048
04:59:42,440 --> 04:59:48,280
who did a viral panel and said okay well

5049
04:59:45,638 --> 04:59:50,718
you have epine bar um and the only thing

5050
04:59:48,280 --> 04:59:53,480
that will heal that is celery juice and

5051
04:59:50,718 --> 04:59:55,080
didn't connect to the medical medium um

5052
04:59:53,480 --> 04:59:57,718
but I had to do my own research and my

5053
04:59:55,080 --> 04:59:59,558
mom had actually read the first book and

5054
04:59:57,718 --> 05:00:01,120
she brought it to me and I put that book

5055
04:59:59,558 --> 05:00:02,958
down on the table that night and I

5056
05:00:01,120 --> 05:00:04,680
cracked it open I said I'm starting

5057
05:00:02,958 --> 05:00:06,360
tomorrow morning and I did and it was

5058
05:00:04,680 --> 05:00:09,600
February 2nd of

5059
05:00:06,360 --> 05:00:12,958
2021 and um this journey has been

5060
05:00:09,600 --> 05:00:15,000
miraculous ulous truly I mean I started

5061
05:00:12,958 --> 05:00:16,558
just because I wanted to feel better I

5062
05:00:15,000 --> 05:00:20,600
didn't know I was going to have the best

5063
05:00:16,558 --> 05:00:23,958
life ever because of it um so it's truly

5064
05:00:20,600 --> 05:00:26,798
incredible I've met the best friends um

5066
05:00:26,798 --> 05:00:31,360
whole family has reconnected over this

05:00:28,840 --> 05:00:34,320
and I truly feel like what had started

5068
05:00:31,360 --> 05:00:37,520
as just healing my illness blossomed

5069
05:00:34,320 --> 05:00:39,200

and it's brought you together a lot yeah

5073
05:00:42,600 --> 05:00:47,440
and I think that it just healed old

5074
05:00:44,080 --> 05:00:49,718
emotional wounds yeah so the soul like

5075
05:00:47,440 --> 05:00:51,000
all of the um emotional healing as well

5076
05:00:49,718 --> 05:00:52,878
like sometimes we think about the

5077
05:00:51,000 --> 05:00:54,600
physical and that's what we what we

5078
05:00:52,878 --> 05:00:56,200
really want to heal right the symptoms

5079
05:00:54,600 --> 05:00:58,360
but then we don't realize that it can be

5080
05:00:56,200 --> 05:01:00,400
connected to to the

5081
05:00:58,360 --> 05:01:01,840

5127
05:02:46,000 --> 05:02:51,360
had it at lunch we came here at 2: p.m.

5128
05:02:48,520 --> 05:02:53,320
well actually 1:00 p.m. and and then

5129
05:02:51,360 --> 05:02:55,798
because they were about to close at 1:30

5130
05:02:53,320 --> 05:02:59,360
so we had to catch and then we did try

5131
05:02:55,798 --> 05:03:03,360
that medical medium uh special menu and

5132
05:02:59,360 --> 05:03:05,920
the food was um I was um very surprised

5133
05:03:03,360 --> 05:03:08,280
and it was just easy eatable you know

5134
05:03:05,920 --> 05:03:10,480
and it was just like you know and I felt

5135
05:03:08,280 --> 05:03:13,000
so light anyways after having so much

5136
05:03:10,480 --> 05:03:15,160
food I could take a walk to the beach

5137
05:03:13,000 --> 05:03:17,320
and I didn't feel tired so it was nice

5138
05:03:15,160 --> 05:03:19,600
yeah MH did you enjoy having lunch and

5139
05:03:17,320 --> 05:03:21,160
dinner here yeah definitely you know

5140
05:03:19,600 --> 05:03:24,200
especially when you're are not cooking

5141
05:03:21,160 --> 05:03:26,480
it because cooking food is also takes a

5142
05:03:24,200 --> 05:03:28,600
lot of time and having this going out

5143
05:03:26,480 --> 05:03:30,400
and having a like medical medium healthy

5144
05:03:28,600 --> 05:03:32,878
food it's the best thing I could ever

5145
05:03:30,400 --> 05:03:35,240
dream of yeah yeah incredible and you

5146
05:03:32,878 --> 05:03:37,600
guys are somewhat locals from the OC

5147
05:03:35,240 --> 05:03:39,240
area so you can come back again yeah

5148
05:03:37,600 --> 05:03:41,000
definitely yep definitely I'm pretty

5149
05:03:39,240 --> 05:03:43,760
sure we're going to do it a lot like

5150
05:03:41,000 --> 05:03:46,440
maybe celebrating some like any holidays

5151
05:03:43,760 --> 05:03:50,440
here right that's such a good idea what

5152
05:03:46,440 --> 05:03:53,320
was your favorite dish uh I did like the

5153
05:03:50,440 --> 05:03:57,920
the sushi mhm and since it doesn't have

5154
05:03:53,320 --> 05:04:00,440
any fish any like a meat and it it just

5155
05:03:57,920 --> 05:04:04,040
tastes like sushi so it was with the

5156
05:04:00,440 --> 05:04:06,200
Wasabi and then the side yeah it was

5157
05:04:04,040 --> 05:04:08,600
very nice I liked it very much what was

5158
05:04:06,200 --> 05:04:11,320
your favorite dish yeah I like the sushi

5159
05:04:08,600 --> 05:04:14,600
as well and the second favorite is the

5160
05:04:11,320 --> 05:04:17,120
I'm trustworthy I guess the fajitas was

5161
05:04:14,600 --> 05:04:19,840
yeah and was the guacamole was the best

5162
05:04:17,120 --> 05:04:23,040
oh yeah it's incredible I finally had uh

5163
05:04:19,840 --> 05:04:25,798
the kelp noodles the papaya salad oh my

5164
05:04:23,040 --> 05:04:29,000
gosh it's so good I loved it yeah I'm

5165
05:04:25,798 --> 05:04:31,958
Noble one was also um it had a nice

5166
05:04:29,000 --> 05:04:34,000
potato and it was nice dressing it was

5167
05:04:31,958 --> 05:04:36,080
very delicious yeah yeah do you think

5168
05:04:34,000 --> 05:04:38,600
that Cafe Gratitude having these medical

5169
05:04:36,080 --> 05:04:40,000
medium uh dishes on the menu will help

5170
05:04:38,600 --> 05:04:41,520
people's healing Journey make it a

5171
05:04:40,000 --> 05:04:44,480
little bit easier for them and more

5172
05:04:41,520 --> 05:04:47,360
enjoyable I believe so I wish they had

5173
05:04:44,480 --> 05:04:50,520
more uh options specifically medical

5174
05:04:47,360 --> 05:04:53,120
medium yeah cuz I only saw like a five

5175
05:04:50,520 --> 05:04:55,080
or four and it's still already a good

5176
05:04:53,120 --> 05:04:57,400
start and I feel like in the future

5177
05:04:55,080 --> 05:04:58,760
maybe uh once they will see more people

5178
05:04:57,400 --> 05:05:01,680
are ordering them they're going to add

5179
05:04:58,760 --> 05:05:04,400
more options so definitely I'm excited

5180
05:05:01,680 --> 05:05:06,680
for this yeah yes what about you yeah I

5181
05:05:04,400 --> 05:05:09,120
think having it in the in the menu it's

5182
05:05:06,680 --> 05:05:11,120
already a big thing because a lot of

5183
05:05:09,120 --> 05:05:13,400
people who doesn't know about the

5184
05:05:11,120 --> 05:05:16,200
information they can see and try it and

5185
05:05:13,400 --> 05:05:19,600
maybe find it out like you know and I

5186
05:05:16,200 --> 05:05:22,520
believe that it's going to like the cafe

5187
05:05:19,600 --> 05:05:24,520
gred is the one of the first like places

5188
05:05:22,520 --> 05:05:27,520
have this menu I hope in the future

5189
05:05:24,520 --> 05:05:29,680
maybe the other places going to like do

5190
05:05:27,520 --> 05:05:32,160
the same and I hope the information

5191
05:05:29,680 --> 05:05:33,920
going to be even more spread it around

5192
05:05:32,160 --> 05:05:35,958

05:06:08,040 --> 05:06:14,280
primarily focused mm medical medium um

5209
05:06:11,520 --> 05:06:16,760
diets and then uh and thank you thanks

5210
05:06:14,280 --> 05:06:19,878
to my wife actually I discovered mm and

5211
05:06:16,760 --> 05:06:22,638
then she's been very encouraging us to

5212
05:06:19,878 --> 05:06:24,638
stick into it believe in it I initially

5213
05:06:22,638 --> 05:06:26,160
was a little bit skeptical because it

5214
05:06:24,638 --> 05:06:28,040
felt like maybe it's another some kind

5215
05:06:26,160 --> 05:06:29,958
of you know like someone just said and

5216
05:06:28,040 --> 05:06:31,558
then she's just following someone else

5217
05:06:29,958 --> 05:06:33,718
and then I just like okay let me give it

5218
05:06:31,558 --> 05:06:38,480
a try as well and I right away started

5219
05:06:33,718 --> 05:06:41,400
feeling well I have healed um in general

5220
05:06:38,480 --> 05:06:44,400
uh per year I get sick like at least two

5221
05:06:41,400 --> 05:06:47,798
three times I used to get sick so since

5222
05:06:44,400 --> 05:06:51,520
I switched to Medical medium uh type of

5223
05:06:47,798 --> 05:06:53,280
feeding myself I I feel myself great I

5224
05:06:51,520 --> 05:06:55,958
haven't been sick for 2 years and it's

5225
05:06:53,280 --> 05:06:58,280
very incredible cuz I'm 37 years old for

5226
05:06:55,958 --> 05:07:00,200
the last like 30 something years I

5227
05:06:58,280 --> 05:07:02,600
remember I've been always a year at

5228
05:07:00,200 --> 05:07:06,080
least couple of times get flu or some

5229
05:07:02,600 --> 05:07:08,680
kind of coldness and then my wife uh she

5230
05:07:06,080 --> 05:07:10,040
healed so many uh health issues and then

5231
05:07:08,680 --> 05:07:13,958
also my mother

5232
05:07:10,040 --> 05:07:18,080
she had a chronic asthma issues she was

5233
05:07:13,958 --> 05:07:21,120
heavy on medic medicine and then uh now

5234
05:07:18,080 --> 05:07:23,680
she no longer takes any medicine only on

5235
05:07:21,120 --> 05:07:26,320
medical medium and she is already

5236
05:07:23,680 --> 05:07:29,280
getting much better she doesn't have any

5237
05:07:26,320 --> 05:07:31,840
more like a chronic illness more like a

5238
05:07:29,280 --> 05:07:34,080
seasonal little bit but we're working on

5239
05:07:31,840 --> 05:07:35,400
it so it's getting much better wow so

5240
05:07:34,080 --> 05:07:37,520
you introduced the whole family to the

5241
05:07:35,400 --> 05:07:41,558
medical medium information yeah I guess

5242
05:07:37,520 --> 05:07:43,480
so I did so I uh I found medical medium

5243
05:07:41,558 --> 05:07:47,080
information because of my own health

5244
05:07:43,480 --> 05:07:49,558
issues and I think my husband was seeing

5245
05:07:47,080 --> 05:07:52,440
how better I'm getting by using medical

5246
05:07:49,558 --> 05:07:55,558
medium because before whatever I did uh

5247
05:07:52,440 --> 05:07:59,638
whatever doctors I FL p i I couldn't

5248
05:07:55,558 --> 05:08:02,000
help myself anyhow so uh yeah he he

5249
05:07:59,638 --> 05:08:04,480
actually I I'm grateful that he catched

5250
05:08:02,000 --> 05:08:06,320
it right away you know of course he was

5251
05:08:04,480 --> 05:08:09,760
skeptical he was just taking whatever

5252
05:08:06,320 --> 05:08:12,240
food I'm giving to him and I think first

5253
05:08:09,760 --> 05:08:15,040
like um year and a half he was doing

5254
05:08:12,240 --> 05:08:17,480
just the morning detox and my husband

5255
05:08:15,040 --> 05:08:20,360
was uh addicted to caffeine and stuff

5256
05:08:17,480 --> 05:08:23,040
and he had the anges actually and with

5257
05:08:20,360 --> 05:08:26,520
the celery juice like it's actually uh

5258
05:08:23,040 --> 05:08:29,558
helps people to like count down I guess

5259
05:08:26,520 --> 05:08:35,440
like he's getting very understanding and

5260
05:08:29,558 --> 05:08:39,798
calm yeah and um yeah so me um I think I

5261
05:08:35,440 --> 05:08:43,040
get rid of over 30 plus symptoms yeah

5262
05:08:39,798 --> 05:08:45,878
wow yeah in 2022 actually I had some uh

5263
05:08:43,040 --> 05:08:48,718
issues and I went to one of the like

5264
05:08:45,878 --> 05:08:51,160
modern places to get the IV therapies

5265
05:08:48,718 --> 05:08:53,040
and and I was unfortunate that I got

5266
05:08:51,160 --> 05:08:55,240
poisoned with the heavy metals because

5267
05:08:53,040 --> 05:08:57,400
they they injected like five different

5268
05:08:55,240 --> 05:08:59,638
medications at that time and I think it

5269
05:08:57,400 --> 05:09:01,718
didn't work well with me yeah after

5270
05:08:59,638 --> 05:09:04,638
right after the IV therapy I start

5271
05:09:01,718 --> 05:09:07,558
having like very heavy symptoms of

5272
05:09:04,638 --> 05:09:10,040
poisoning with the heavy metals and

5273
05:09:07,558 --> 05:09:13,080
depression and panic attacks was the one

5274
05:09:10,040 --> 05:09:15,320
of them yeah and I remember then when I

5275
05:09:13,080 --> 05:09:18,520
started drinking celeres like on day

5276
05:09:15,320 --> 05:09:20,558
four I felt so much better my anxiety

5277
05:09:18,520 --> 05:09:24,080
start getting better and it was like

5278
05:09:20,558 --> 05:09:27,080
Miracle because it worked for me like

5279
05:09:24,080 --> 05:09:28,280
from the first day so I knew that this

5280
05:09:27,080 --> 05:09:30,680

5281
05:09:28,280 --> 05:09:32,080

easier and more enjoyable for them oh

5344
05:12:06,360 --> 05:12:10,440
absolutely and it reminds me of

5345
05:12:08,360 --> 05:12:12,200
something that Anthony Williams says

5346
05:12:10,440 --> 05:12:14,798
where you know we only have so many

5347
05:12:12,200 --> 05:12:17,760
meals in this lifetime and I think you

5348
05:12:14,798 --> 05:12:20,000
know in any of those heals if meals if

5349
05:12:17,760 --> 05:12:22,680
we can bring that healing into it it's

5350
05:12:20,000 --> 05:12:24,840
so important every everyone counts and

5351
05:12:22,680 --> 05:12:27,120
so being able to have a place where

5352
05:12:24,840 --> 05:12:29,360
people can go and and enjoy meal with

5353
05:12:27,120 --> 05:12:31,878
their loved ones um at such an

5354
05:12:29,360 --> 05:12:33,798
accessible way uh it's it's a

5355
05:12:31,878 --> 05:12:36,798
GameChanger so how has the medical

5356
05:12:33,798 --> 05:12:38,240
medium information helped you heal yeah

5357
05:12:36,798 --> 05:12:39,958
so um like I mentioned I've been doing

5358
05:12:38,240 --> 05:12:42,200
this for eight years and I came on to

5359
05:12:39,958 --> 05:12:44,638
his information because I had a lot of

5360
05:12:42,200 --> 05:12:47,200
severe mental health issues um you know

5361
05:12:44,638 --> 05:12:49,480
I'd wake up and feel just severely

5362
05:12:47,200 --> 05:12:52,080
depressed and anxious but not really be

5363
05:12:49,480 --> 05:12:53,718
able to pinpoint why I felt that way it

5364
05:12:52,080 --> 05:12:56,558
wasn't like an outside factor or

5365
05:12:53,718 --> 05:12:58,160
anything and and I just um I remember I

5366
05:12:56,558 --> 05:13:00,320
was going through a heartbreak you know

5367
05:12:58,160 --> 05:13:01,520
as we all do breakups girl you know and

5368
05:13:00,320 --> 05:13:04,920
I'm in the bookstore and I'm soul

5369
05:13:01,520 --> 05:13:06,120
searching and I I I actually look on my

5370
05:13:04,920 --> 05:13:09,320
phone and I'm like what are the top

5371
05:13:06,120 --> 05:13:11,638
books right now in this space and I make

5372
05:13:09,320 --> 05:13:13,520
eye contact with the first book with the

5373
05:13:11,638 --> 05:13:15,000
lungs and I'm like that's so interesting

5374
05:13:13,520 --> 05:13:16,558
that it looks like that and I look up

5375
05:13:15,000 --> 05:13:18,558
from my phone and I make direct eye

5376
05:13:16,558 --> 05:13:20,320
contact with the book and so I kind of

5377
05:13:18,558 --> 05:13:22,760
took it as a sign I was like okay let me

5378
05:13:20,320 --> 05:13:24,958
take it and just immediately I resonated

5379
05:13:22,760 --> 05:13:27,718
with it and um with time I've been able

5380
05:13:24,958 --> 05:13:30,718
to incorporate so many of the healing

5381
05:13:27,718 --> 05:13:32,920
protocols um to the point where I really

5382
05:13:30,718 --> 05:13:36,680
feel like I've moved forward in feeling

5383
05:13:32,920 --> 05:13:39,280
more mentally resilient um and just have

5384
05:13:36,680 --> 05:13:42,000
a more positive compassionate out look

5385
05:13:39,280 --> 05:13:43,480
on life and I think if anyone has

5386
05:13:42,000 --> 05:13:46,000
struggled with like a mental health

5387
05:13:43,480 --> 05:13:47,480
issue like that's so invaluable

5388
05:13:46,000 --> 05:13:49,480
especially if it's been your day today

5389
05:13:47,480 --> 05:13:52,320
and and there's so much freedom in that

5390
05:13:49,480 --> 05:13:54,400
and so I I feel like the trajectory of

5391
05:13:52,320 --> 05:13:56,920

05:13:54,400 --> 05:13:58,320

a range of flavors in in a medical

5404
05:14:27,400 --> 05:14:31,360
medium type meal I'm used to things

5405
05:14:29,120 --> 05:14:34,680
being quite a bit more basic and rustic

5406
05:14:31,360 --> 05:14:37,400
in what I cook you know so uh it was

5407
05:14:34,680 --> 05:14:42,360
quite it was quite good um the first few

um and just really cleansing and you

5410
05:14:45,958 --> 05:14:49,878
could feel that and then to me the L the

5411
05:14:48,160 --> 05:14:51,680
latter the last dishes but the last

5412
05:14:49,878 --> 05:14:54,400
couple dishes you know they were a

5413
05:14:51,680 --> 05:14:57,440
little richer and and filling so I I

5414
05:14:54,400 --> 05:15:01,718

the the sushi was was very very clean

5421
05:15:17,280 --> 05:15:23,840
and it just sort of went down very

5422
05:15:18,680 --> 05:15:25,840
nicely cleanly on the pallet um of the

5423
05:15:23,840 --> 05:15:30,920
I'm not a chef okay so I might be

5424
05:15:25,840 --> 05:15:33,520
completely bungling words on this um uh

5425
05:15:30,920 --> 05:15:37,120
what came after that it was

5426
05:15:33,520 --> 05:15:39,638
um the kelp yes the kelp that also was

5427
05:15:37,120 --> 05:15:43,400
very clean it had a nice it was kind of

5428
05:15:39,638 --> 05:15:46,558
crunchy and nice and tasty and then we

05:15:57,000 --> 05:16:04,360

were really great they were so amazing

5438
05:16:08,760 --> 05:16:11,360
what what was your experience like

5439
05:16:09,878 --> 05:16:14,160
meeting

5440
05:16:11,360 --> 05:16:17,920
aw um

5441
05:16:14,160 --> 05:16:19,760
very I mean very moving very moving

5442
05:16:17,920 --> 05:16:23,360
experience

5443
05:16:19,760 --> 05:16:25,760
um uh let's see I

5444
05:16:23,360 --> 05:16:28,280
asked my wife wanted to give him

5445
05:16:25,760 --> 05:16:32,878
something cuz my wife's kind of a nerd

5446
05:16:28,280 --> 05:16:35,240
and likes to do research and such and um

5447
05:16:32,878 --> 05:16:37,958
wanted him to look at some of the

5448
05:16:35,240 --> 05:16:40,840
research that she did and so she wrote

5449
05:16:37,958 --> 05:16:43,958
something up and I gave and that and I

5450
05:16:40,840 --> 05:16:46,718
thanked him for some of his podcasts

5451
05:16:43,958 --> 05:16:49,120
that he's done actually the telegrams on

5452
05:16:46,718 --> 05:16:53,480
on angels that I found particularly

5453
05:16:49,120 --> 05:16:58,400
meaningful for me uh because for me

5454
05:16:53,480 --> 05:17:00,920
I I I used to pray um like actually

5455
05:16:58,400 --> 05:17:02,878
starting around the age of five until

5456
05:17:00,920 --> 05:17:05,360
around 20 and then I started getting

5457
05:17:02,878 --> 05:17:08,558
kind of confused a little bit about what

5458
05:17:05,360 --> 05:17:10,520
I should be praying to because it seemed

5459
05:17:08,558 --> 05:17:13,400
like there are people from all sorts of

5460
05:17:10,520 --> 05:17:17,638
religions that have deep

5461
05:17:13,400 --> 05:17:20,320
meaningful uh thoughts about what they

5462
05:17:17,638 --> 05:17:23,000
believe and I didn't feel like those

5463
05:17:20,320 --> 05:17:25,680
people were any less or more valid valid

5464
05:17:23,000 --> 05:17:27,798
than the belief system that I was at the

5465
05:17:25,680 --> 05:17:30,840
time following and so I kind of stayed

5466
05:17:27,798 --> 05:17:33,680
on the sidelines for a long time until I

5467
05:17:30,840 --> 05:17:36,958
heard that the couple telegrams he had

5468
05:17:33,680 --> 05:17:39,000
and somehow it that clicked for me on on

5469
05:17:36,958 --> 05:17:40,638
angels and praying to the angels and

5470
05:17:39,000 --> 05:17:44,718
then so I started resuming that again

5471
05:17:40,638 --> 05:17:47,080
and it's been a long long Hiatus when I

5472
05:17:44,718 --> 05:17:50,240
really kind of stopped or felt very

5473
05:17:47,080 --> 05:17:52,638
insecure about it so

5474
05:17:50,240 --> 05:17:55,280
um so yeah those are some of the things

5475
05:17:52,638 --> 05:17:59,400
I mentioned and I think I mentioned to

5476
05:17:55,280 --> 05:18:02,440
him if he had any idea or if SOC said

5477
05:17:59,400 --> 05:18:06,558
anything special and he said he was just

5478
05:18:02,440 --> 05:18:09,000
he was just very I was Floyd he was just

5479
05:18:06,558 --> 05:18:11,558
very very

5480
05:18:09,000 --> 05:18:12,680
nice about communicating what SOC had

5481
05:18:11,558 --> 05:18:16,400
said

5482
05:18:12,680 --> 05:18:20,240
he's um something that I

5483
05:18:16,400 --> 05:18:22,400
was you know a smart guy and you know

5484
05:18:20,240 --> 05:18:24,400
keep doing things I honestly don't

5485
05:18:22,400 --> 05:18:26,040
remember it was a moment you have to

5486
05:18:24,400 --> 05:18:27,840
watch the live stream back and get that

5487
05:18:26,040 --> 05:18:29,760
you know that's right yeah exactly I

5488
05:18:27,840 --> 05:18:31,480
would have to watch it again to know for

5489
05:18:29,760 --> 05:18:33,240
sure cuz I could say now and then I'd

5490
05:18:31,480 --> 05:18:35,480
watch the live stream and say wait he

5491
05:18:33,240 --> 05:18:37,638
said that you know that's actually what

5492
05:18:35,480 --> 05:18:40,160
happened in the M yeah yes exactly it

5493
05:18:37,638 --> 05:18:41,558
can be a bit of a blow yeah yeah and

5494
05:18:40,160 --> 05:18:42,840
what has your medical medium Journey

5495
05:18:41,558 --> 05:18:44,920
been like would you like to share a bit

5496
05:18:42,840 --> 05:18:47,840
of that with the community watching um

5497
05:18:44,920 --> 05:18:51,558
sure I mean my medical medium Journey

5498
05:18:47,840 --> 05:18:53,718
has been mostly just sort of watching my

5499
05:18:51,558 --> 05:18:57,120
wife who's the canary in the coal mine

5500
05:18:53,718 --> 05:19:00,718
for me because whenever Anthony speaks

5501
05:18:57,120 --> 05:19:03,120
of ailments basically she's kind of felt

5502
05:19:00,718 --> 05:19:07,080
them all you know it doesn't matter what

5503
05:19:03,120 --> 05:19:09,280
you know at some point she has felt any

5504
05:19:07,080 --> 05:19:11,878
one of those number of ailments

5505
05:19:09,280 --> 05:19:14,878
and um and I've seen how helpful it's

5506
05:19:11,878 --> 05:19:16,798
been for her because she's done we've

5507
05:19:14,878 --> 05:19:19,480
done so many different other things and

5508
05:19:16,798 --> 05:19:22,120
tried so many different other things so

5509
05:19:19,480 --> 05:19:25,200
um at first that was the main thing and

5510
05:19:22,120 --> 05:19:28,160
then because I saw the benefit to her I

5511
05:19:25,200 --> 05:19:31,280
started doing some of those things like

5512
05:19:28,160 --> 05:19:33,798
the lime water and the celery juice and

5513
05:19:31,280 --> 05:19:37,000
the heavy metal detox smoothie and

5514
05:19:33,798 --> 05:19:39,200
eating eating cleaner and um you know

5515
05:19:37,000 --> 05:19:40,840
and then gradually find tuning in and

5516
05:19:39,200 --> 05:19:44,798
getting more knowledgeable about what to

5517
05:19:40,840 --> 05:19:46,840
do and but finally toward the toward the

5518
05:19:44,798 --> 05:19:49,480
end I I had a full mouth reconstruction

5519
05:19:46,840 --> 05:19:54,360
done by my brother who was a

5520
05:19:49,480 --> 05:19:57,920
dentist is a dentist and um but I kept

5521
05:19:54,360 --> 05:19:59,600
losing caps anyway um cuz he would cap

5522
05:19:57,920 --> 05:20:04,240
my teeth and they kept coming out anyway

5523
05:19:59,600 --> 05:20:08,920
I lost a bunch of them and

5524
05:20:04,240 --> 05:20:11,558
um as as a result you know I I would was

5525
05:20:08,920 --> 05:20:13,878
I saw a few other dentists who said that

5526
05:20:11,558 --> 05:20:15,320
it they didn't see any reason that it

5527
05:20:13,878 --> 05:20:17,320
would stop unless I did something more

5528
05:20:15,320 --> 05:20:19,240
aggressive and so or do something

5529
05:20:17,320 --> 05:20:21,760
different because they were just they

5530
05:20:19,240 --> 05:20:24,798
still kept coming out and so I decided

5531
05:20:21,760 --> 05:20:28,558
to finally adopt some of the protocols

5532
05:20:24,798 --> 05:20:31,120
and that those finally worked so um

5533
05:20:28,558 --> 05:20:33,480
those have been really really helpful um

5534
05:20:31,120 --> 05:20:37,958
I would hardly say I'm out of the woods

5535
05:20:33,480 --> 05:20:39,440
and I you know I'm hopefully not um you

5536
05:20:37,958 --> 05:20:41,520
know going to make make a two steps

5537
05:20:39,440 --> 05:20:43,878
backward move on you know cuz he talks

5538
05:20:41,520 --> 05:20:48,120
about the three steps forward two two

5539
05:20:43,878 --> 05:20:49,520
steps back so um uh that's been really

5540
05:20:48,120 --> 05:20:51,920
helpful that's kind of been the main

5541
05:20:49,520 --> 05:20:53,558
thing oh that's incredible well where's

5542
05:20:51,920 --> 05:20:55,400
your wife this evening is she with you

5543
05:20:53,558 --> 05:20:59,480
here or is she watching from harm or

5544
05:20:55,400 --> 05:21:01,600
she's watching from home she she um has

5545
05:20:59,480 --> 05:21:03,958
a tendency to need to eat very very low

5546
05:21:01,600 --> 05:21:06,080
fat and she was concerned whether the

5547
05:21:03,958 --> 05:21:09,600
dishes would be sufficiently low fat for

5548
05:21:06,080 --> 05:21:11,240
her and so um she decided rather than

5549
05:21:09,600 --> 05:21:13,638
take somebody's spot she would just stay

5550
05:21:11,240 --> 05:21:17,558
home wow can we say hello to her before

5551
05:21:13,638 --> 05:21:19,280

5556
05:21:26,840 --> 05:21:33,000

was the food oh amazing loved it yeah

5558
05:21:33,000 --> 05:21:38,680
what were your favorite dishes for me

5559
05:21:34,760 --> 05:21:41,600
was the sushi and the burrito bow

5560
05:21:38,680 --> 05:21:44,320
um yeah the food was amazing everything

5561

5658
05:26:01,920 --> 05:26:09,040

5663
05:26:15,920 --> 05:26:22,680
healing process yeah so that's beautiful

5664
05:26:19,680 --> 05:26:26,878
how did you first discover medical

5665
05:26:22,680 --> 05:26:29,280
medium I have always loved health and

5666
05:26:26,878 --> 05:26:33,280
seeking had gone through some things in

5667
05:26:29,280 --> 05:26:35,120
my life and um it just appeared

5668
05:26:33,280 --> 05:26:37,958
angelically I believe you know it's just

5669
05:26:35,120 --> 05:26:40,000
like it's just there and I was intrigued

5670
05:26:37,958 --> 05:26:42,798
and so so I started to look into it

5671
05:26:40,000 --> 05:26:44,798
little by little and then just kind of

5672
05:26:42,798 --> 05:26:47,000
evolved started doing celery juice and

5673
05:26:44,798 --> 05:26:50,840
hmds now we have a routine where every

5674
05:26:47,000 --> 05:26:52,760
morning we get up and we do the the the

5675
05:26:50,840 --> 05:26:54,760
protocol straight on through so it's

5676
05:26:52,760 --> 05:26:58,120
been beautiful yeah what benefits have

5677
05:26:54,760 --> 05:27:01,798
you found the benefits I found were just

5678
05:26:58,120 --> 05:27:05,638
the skin the skin healing and clearing

5679
05:27:01,798 --> 05:27:09,240
up and uh sinuses was the big thing for

5680
05:27:05,638 --> 05:27:11,920
me I had sinus issues bad sinus issues

5681
05:27:09,240 --> 05:27:14,040
and those issues are now gone I can ask

5682
05:27:11,920 --> 05:27:17,200
I remember actually the day that I was

5683
05:27:14,040 --> 05:27:19,840
able to taste food again which was quite

5684
05:27:17,200 --> 05:27:24,040
profound spiritual experience like

5685
05:27:19,840 --> 05:27:27,160
losing taste is just like I didn't like

5686
05:27:24,040 --> 05:27:30,040
that at all yeah it takes a vital part

5687
05:27:27,160 --> 05:27:32,638
of life away from us flavor of life and

5688
05:27:30,040 --> 05:27:37,000
I got that back from the information

5689
05:27:32,638 --> 05:27:38,638
celery juice hmds every morning texures

5690
05:27:37,000 --> 05:27:40,760
every morning

5691
05:27:38,638 --> 05:27:43,480
yeah and then trying to stay fat free

5692
05:27:40,760 --> 05:27:47,240
and that's the big challenge for for us

5693
05:27:43,480 --> 05:27:49,360
moving forward is staying fat free so

5694
05:27:47,240 --> 05:27:50,638
