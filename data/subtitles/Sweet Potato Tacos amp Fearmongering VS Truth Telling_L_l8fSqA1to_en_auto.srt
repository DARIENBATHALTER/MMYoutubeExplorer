gaslight you guys

29
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,879
because there's a lot of gas lighting

30
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,080
going out there

31
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:07,080

pressuring

33
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:13,200
gaslighting fear mongering

34
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,040
right the whole bit the thing is is you

35
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,560
ever run into anybody you guys have you

36
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,320
ever run into anybody that just they

37
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,240
weren't ready

38
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:26,320
and that's okay right they weren't ready

39
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:29,439
you know to do what they needed to do

40
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,960
you know they weren't ready to

41
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,479
take care of themselves like they needed

42
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,479
to do right you know

43
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:35,840
they're still doing the whole in

44
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:37,200
moderation

45
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,960
i could still have a pizza on the

46
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,240
weekends and that's fine i get it i'm

47
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,840
like you guys probably do that some of

48
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,680
you guys probably do that of course

49
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,920
i'm still doing my pizza i'm still doing

50
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,560
my chocolate i'm still doing

51
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,560
i'm still doing my gluten in between so

52
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,200
what it's just once in a while right

53
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:56,159
and they're not ready to take that next

54
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,240
step to free themselves right

55
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,439
and someone's gonna be like hey you

56
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,200
should be allowed to do whatever you

57
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:03,360
wanna do you should be allowed to do

58
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,799
and eat what you feel like eating you

59
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,799
should be allowed to have some gluten

60
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,720
you should be allowed to

61
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,399
have some pizza once in a while i should

62
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,400
be allowed to partake in things because

63
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:15,360
it only makes you stronger

64
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,440

65
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,239

you should have some chocolate who cares

96
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,319
if you get a little canola oil in you in

97
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,000

104
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:38,640
little bit of that makes you stronger

105
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:41,920
you get weaker if you

106
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:44,640

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,560
food i could just live my life and not

190
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,759
think about food and eat whatever i want

191
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,120
when i want

192
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,120
and then it makes you feel like a real

193
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,000
piece of crap too that's one right there

194
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,960
because a lot of people

195
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,400
who aren't sick they aren't sick or they

196
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,400
say they're sick

197
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,160
but they're really not they get a little

198
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,520
energy a little brain

199
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,000
touch of brain fog little acne they see

200
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,680
their

201
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,919
different functional medicine doctors

202
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,560
they stay out of the woods

203
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,199
because they're not eating so so

204
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,960
terrible

205
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,720
and they're not sick yet they're not

206
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,919
sick sick yet right

207
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,759
and then they'll be the ones to be like

208
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:48,000
i don't really think about food i don't

209
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:51,199
really focus about food i live my life

210
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,400
i'm a life liver not a food eater you

211
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,880
focus on food

212
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,319
you go focus on food there you know yeah

213
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,000
you go worry about everything you're

214
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,319
eating go worry about all your

215
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,319
your lettuces worry about your tomatoes

216
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,000
worried about all your stuff and

217
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,599
i'll go live my life and have a glass of

218
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
wine when i feel like it and i'll have a

219
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:10,000
little pizza when i feel like it and

220
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,919
you know you know i'll pick choices

221
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,039
intuitively to what feels good in the

222
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,560
moment but other than that i don't

223
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,160
really think about food so it's another

224
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,599
form of gas lighting right there

225
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,680
it's another thing here they bring the

226
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:21,520
gasoline container over and they got the

227
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,560
lighter and they're dumping gasoline on

228
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,639
you and they

229
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,800
they hit the flame and that's how it

230
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,520
works right and then the moderation gas

231
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,440
lighting

232
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,120
that that right there is a whole other

233
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,120
another thing all on its own

234
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,720
so it's like yeah you should be allowed

235
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,880
to do moderation

236
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,800
or you weaken your system i heard that

237
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:41,919
one pretty recently like

238
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,759
your system needs to be bombarded by all

239
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,280
this crap out there you need to go out

240
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:46,720
on the streets you need to breathe in

241
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:50,960
all the smog

242
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:53,039
you need to get exposed by germs

243
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,039
you need to be licking your hands after

244
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:57,759
you touch a hand door handle

245
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:59,440

246
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,479
touch the doorknob doesn't matter just

247
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,120

248
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,160

250
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,360
you know people just didn't even care

251
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:09,840

252
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:13,039

256
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,319
it's fear mongering saying look be

257
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,400
cautious about that door handle

258
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,599

259
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,599
taste tester

00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,680
so it's not only do you need

377
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,560
the cover like protection on the toilet

378
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,920
seat

379
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:29,519
but you got to worry about the splash

380
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:32,639
so if you're peeing sitting down

381
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:34,720
right you're going to have splash

382
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,920
coming up from that water it's just

383
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,120
going to be splashing

384
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:41,120
you see all these micro splashes right

385
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,800
so you wanna you in a public restroom

386
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,560
you wanna flush it

387
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,000
before you even sit on there even if the

388
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,600
water looks clean oh it obviously

389
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,560
flushed somebody flushed it will flush

390
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,320
it again

391
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,000
so then you have less of a chance of

392
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,560
exposure but

393
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,360
is this fear-mongering are you scared

394
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,760
now

395
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,360
are you scared like is everybody scared

396
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,920
are you scared out of your mind

397
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:04,240
right or is it truth-telling or can

398
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,519
someone handle truth-telling

399
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,519
what is it if they can't handle

400
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,920
truth-telling i understand

401
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,279
but what is it is it fear-mongering

402
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,040
right

403
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:15,040
ashley kevin says that's what the splash

404
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,600
is the worst um

405
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,880
now it's protecting it's having your

406
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,120
back

407
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,880
you know so it's either is it fear

408
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,920
mongering or is it having

409
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,480
your back or having your body's back how

410
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,680
about that

411
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:31,040
or you having your body's back you know

412
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,800
so when you look at all the different

413
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,399
levels you guys

414
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,920
we're live on youtube live on facebook

415
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,279
i'm about to make sweet potato tacos or

416
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,120
live on clubhouse

417
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,480
if you look at it all right you'll see

418
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,279
the traps everywhere

419
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,839
okay the moderation trap right there

420
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,600
okay

421
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,360
then you feel like well moderation

422
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,040
everybody's saying moderation

423
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,360
maybe that's the right way to go maybe

424
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:53,680
that's what i should do right

425
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,240
and but what no one realizes is you

426
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:58,160
poison yourself in moderation we poison

427
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,680
ourselves in moderation do you like

428
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:02,959
poisoning yourself

429
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:05,839
i mean we poison ourselves in moderation

430
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:08,480
and it's almost like pushing the body to

431
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:11,600
the limit pushing the body to the edge

432
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:14,720
will the body give yeah it does

433
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:16,160
it gives on everybody eventually right

434
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,399
chris you seem finding me good to see

435
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,279
you yeah and and so the whole thing is

436
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,959
we

437
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:26,480
we have this mechanism our body

438
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:27,600
that gets pushed to the edge all the

439
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,920
time

440
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,120
and it eventually starts to break down

441
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,360
one way or another

442
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:36,240
it just starts to break down it just

443
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:38,880

444
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,160

472
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:41,199

beautiful purple sweet potatoes right

478
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,920
here

479
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,880
as i told you guys earlier i pre-steamed

480
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:57,600
them and

481
00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:00,639
still left them kind of not completely

482
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,480
cooked but just about

483
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:03,680
and then i'm gonna give them a toast in

484
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,839
the oven for a little while

485
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,680
if you don't pre-steam them you gotta

486
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,600
you know bake them in the oven

487
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,839
for sure you got to give them that bake

488
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:15,040
time but this is going to be a faster

489
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,040
way of doing it for today

490
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:18,800
it's like how much do you guys want to

491
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,040

492
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:24,639
right how much do you want to know

493
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,800
how much can people handle that's

494
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:30,160
another thing too you know

495
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:32,320
did an alien spacecraft

496
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:34,639
right looking for a hand towel here here

497
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:37,839
it is didn't alien spacecraft

498
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:37,839
bring the human race here

499
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:43,519
we're not it's interesting question

500
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,519
right

501
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,920
um

502
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:51,839
take these little cubes here

503
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,000
is the toilet bowl

504
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,720
filled with a lot of bad bugs and we

505
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,759
have to be careful when we sit on it

506
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,439
publicly

507
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:09,039
yeah we do got to be cautious

508
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:12,160
before the plague very few people

509
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:15,039
no one i knew did

510
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,000
the the hand sanitizer before touching

511
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:18,559
the cart

512
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,240
at the grocery store do a couple more of

513
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:22,319
these

514
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:26,720
just grab the cart doesn't matter what

515
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:26,720
ha what was what's on the cart handles

516
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,000
rub your eye

517
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:35,440
spread the flue

518
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,039
everybody's got the flu in the winter

519
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,799
everybody's touching everything

520
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:40,080
touching doorknobs no one's thinking

521
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:42,320
about anything

522
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:45,360
doesn't matter just eat something grab a

523
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:48,720
sandwich don't wash your hands

524
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:50,000
right makes you stronger it doesn't i've

525
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:53,039
seen

526
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,520
i've seen it knock people down and knock

527
00:17:53,039 --> 00:18:01,840
them down

528
00:17:53,520 --> 00:18:01,840
i'm going to cut a couple more of these

529
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:10,880
so our immune system weakens

530
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,720
because it's bombarded by so many

531
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,080
different things so your immune system

532
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,840
is bombarded our immune system

533
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,919
is bombarded is it fear mongering or is

534
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,600
the truth telling

535
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,520
our immune system gets bombarded every

536
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:24,000
single day okay radiation

537
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,720
all right mercury falling out of the sky

538
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,840
okay

539
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:30,000
mosquito spray just so you know that the

540
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:33,200
chemical companies are trying to kill us

541
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
they just dump mosquito spray all over

542
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,960
the world

543
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,679
on top of us mosquito sprays okay that's

544
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,600
what they do

545
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,799
that's their favorite is that mosquito

546
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,400
spray right

547
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:44,160
we breathe in and we breathe in and we

548
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:47,280
get knocked down the point is

549
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:49,520
it's not about being in fear it's about

550
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:52,640
how do we fortify ourselves protect

551
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:54,400
ourselves make ourselves stronger

552
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,240
and then the perfumes colognes just so

553
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,840
you know that stuff is so toxic

554
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,919
the air fresheners the scented candles

555
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:03,360
are so toxic

00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:06,640
so toxic it's unbelievable you guys have

557
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:10,160

basically i'm gonna marinate these a

563
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,480
little bit

564
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,960
so let me put this down for a second

565
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,960
right here

566
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,840
all right

567
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:33,520
i'm gonna put this over here actually

568
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,520
let's add some lime juice

569
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,720
and

570
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:41,840
i think when people really they want to

571
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,440
live their life and they don't want to

572
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:46,240
be thinking anything so

573
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,600
they don't want to be thinking about

574
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,679
something

575
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:52,480
they have no control over but you really

576
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:54,720
do have control over so much got control

577
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:57,679
over the perfumes clones in your life

578
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:59,679

580
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:06,640
right air fresheners

00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:07,440
aftershaves right you got control over

582
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,159
those

583
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,600
that's a big deal on its own um that

584
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:13,520
just knocks people down

585
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,280
knocks them down bad right you got

586
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:17,120
control over how much fish you're eating

587
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,039
you got to worry about the mercury right

588
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:21,760
got control when you learn

589
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:23,679

590
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,039
bring you so fast to alzheimer's and

666
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:37,280
lower the immune system

667
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:39,840
and scented candles lower the immune

668
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:42,720

should you can check that out medical

676
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:57,440
media podcast said

apple podcast killing you smelly is the

678
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,120
name of that episode

679
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:03,600
nobody told me about how caffeine's

680
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:06,720
damaging my adrenals

681
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,919
and and bringing on my depression even

682
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,600
worse

683
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:11,600
nobody told me it was a psychoactive

684
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:14,720
drug that was actually

685
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:18,080
not healthy for me right and then

686
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:19,200
creates birth problems and in conditions

687
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:23,200
with my children

688
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:25,200
too but no one talks about that okay

689
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,799
and i've had so many people tell me over

690
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,679
the years how come nobody knew any of

691
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:30,640
this

692
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:32,159
why do we have to trial and error you

693
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,240
know nobody told me that

694
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:36,000
it was important to be cautious about

695
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,760
exposure versus

696
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,679
thinking that exposure would make me

697
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:41,679
stronger and make my immune system

698
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:44,000
stronger because we're supposed to get

699
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:46,320
a stronger immune system due to exposure

700
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,320
because that's what we're told right

701
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:50,799
just every bit of exposure makes you

702
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:53,919
strong but no one's saying

703
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:54,559
anything about that like what to look

704
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,760
out for

705
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:58,640
okay and all these all these things

706
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:01,919
matter

707
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,559
you know and who's looking out for us in

708
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:04,480
the end

709
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:05,760
right so we have to look out for each

710
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,039
other but if we're not given that

711
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,039

00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:09,600

i wish more people knew about how toxic

fragrances are

742
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,600
even after you tell them they keep on

743
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:22,320
using them absolutely

744
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,320
of course they do

745
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:27,200
one thing that happens that people don't

746
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:30,240
understand is that

747
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:33,279
fragrances are an

748
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:36,320
invasion upon us

749
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:39,440

750
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:41,039

751
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,960
that might be too far i might have gone

752
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:44,799
too far on that

753
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,440
i think you guys think i've gone too far

754
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:50,640
to that but

755
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:52,320
it's a form of darkness because the

756
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:56,159
chemical companies

757
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:59,360
who conjure up these dangerous chemicals

758
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:00,559
just laughing in our faces slapping in

759
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:04,240
our faces

760
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:04,880
right like creating fake wildflower

761
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,640
smells

762
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:11,840
and just fake toxic perfume smells

763
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,559
right and meanwhile really just laughing

764
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,919
at our face

765
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:17,039
i'm gonna put a little honey in there

766
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:17,039
you guys okay if i do that

767
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,840
a lot went in there

768
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:31,120
right then they make us afraid of bugs

769
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,399
they'll make us afraid of mosquitoes

770
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,640
they'll make us afraid of things and

771
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:37,200
then they'll just want us to wish we had

772
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:42,240
mosquito spray being dumped on us

773
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:42,240
you know it's like

774
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,080
they fear monger us into they fear

775
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:50,960
monger us

776
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:55,120
into wanting to be intoxicated

777
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:56,880
you know um

778
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,720
ticks cause lyme disease they'll say

779
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,159
which is not true ticks don't cause lyme

780
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:03,360
disease you guys

781
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:04,640
but you wouldn't believe in in places

782
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:07,600
where there are a lot of ticks

783
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:09,679
people getting tick spray all on their

784
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:11,679
properties all on their yards right

785
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,200
for their children to play so that's

786
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:16,960
that's what's happening right

787
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:19,919
so all like oh my god all in new england

788
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:21,520
on the east coast of the u.s other

789
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:22,799
places united states and

790
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,880
practically anywhere in the united

791
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:27,520
states now right is

792
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,880
parents are being told you know you

793
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,720
better have some

794
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,000
some chemical company come in a

795
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,399
pesticide company

796
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,919
come insecticide and spray for ticks in

797
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:38,240
your lawn your property

798
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:40,159
your your adjacent woods maybe to your

799
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:42,640
property or your house right

800
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:43,200
because you know your children you know

801
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,960
need to be

802
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,799
safe because they're going to get lyme

803
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,320
disease from tick bites right

804
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:50,240
children don't get lyme disease from

805
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:53,440
tick bites right i talk about that in

806
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:54,960
the medical medium book the new edition

807
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,440
children don't get lyme disease from

808
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:59,039
tick bites bites it's not tick bites

809
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:01,039
ticks don't do that so it's really

810
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:01,760
important to know this is a new addition

811
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:05,120
by the way

812
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:07,919
and mosquitoes don't spread disease

813
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:10,000
here in the united states and most other

814
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:13,360
places around the world right

815
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:15,360
malaria is the only thing that

816
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:17,360
mosquitoes have ever spread

817
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:19,360
and even that's questionable by the way

818
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:22,080
in certain for certain reasons

819
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:23,679
but the bottom line is they'll put you

820
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:26,159
in fear about these things and

821
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:27,760
in tick with ticks everybody sprays

822
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:30,720
their lawns they spray

823
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:32,159
all around their house they spray in

824
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,240
their houses

825
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:36,120
and now you're exposing your children to

826
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:39,360
a deadly

827
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:40,000
neurotoxic chemical right it does have

828
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:43,600
long-term

829
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:46,559
damage to the body and nervous system

830
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:48,559
and so so now your children are in the

831
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:51,120
yard they're playing in the grass that

832
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:53,679
was sprayed by the tick spray company

833
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,480
i mean it's the endless problems with

834
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:56,240
this

835
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,320
i mean with with the mistakes that are

836
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:00,640
made all the time but you get put

837
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,600
into fear about it so the gas lighting

838
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,919
comes around so the

839
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:05,039
end up bringing that big that big

840
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:07,440
gasoline can

841
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:09,520
over just jump it there we go they dump

842
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:11,039
it all over you and bring out the match

843
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,480
you gotta spray for ticks you gotta

844
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:13,360
spray for ticks you gotta spray for

845
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,720
ticks

846
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:20,240
and you get you get lit up again

847
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:23,279
are incense toxic yeah they are yvonne

848
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:26,559
um yeah they're toxic

849
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:28,159
incense is just as toxic i'm just going

850
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:29,679
to be straight up is the perfumes the

851
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:31,760
clones air fresheners and scented

852
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:34,000
candles

853
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:36,559
chemical companies got your number they

854
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,480
got your number

855
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:40,640
they got your number in your head your

856
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,679
mind they got your number in your head

857
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:45,120
in mind

858
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:47,279
um kim blocker says

859
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:48,559
are you against a cup of organic coffee

860
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:50,880
for fatty liver

861
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:53,279
look it's not that i'm against it like

862
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:56,000
hey he's against it

863
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:57,679
but if you have a fatty liver i mean i i

864
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,279
wouldn't drink coffee if you have a

865
00:30:57,679 --> 00:30:59,919
fatty liver because the coffee the

866
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:02,399
caffeine

867
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:03,760
is what tires out a liver and keeps on

868
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:05,919
tiring out a liver

869
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:07,760
so if you have a fatty liver there's not

870
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:09,519
it's not going to be an easy road to

871
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,799
healing a fatty liver if you have any

872
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:12,000
caffeine going in there

873
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:14,480
should listen to the medical mean

874
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:17,120
podcast coffee matcha tea and

875
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:18,559
and chocolate um medical mean podcast

876
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:21,919
apple podcast

877
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:24,159
so what coffee does is and all caffeine

878
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:26,399
does is it stresses out the liver it

879
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:27,279
weakens it it beats it down and that's

880
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:29,519
what it does and

881
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:31,039
and that might be just a simple way of

882
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:33,120
saying it right there but if you want

883
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:35,279
the more detailed version

884
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:37,279
is caffeine prompts your adrenals to

885
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:38,960
flood a tremendous amount of epinephrine

886
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:41,039
into your bloodstream your liver has to

887
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:42,320
soak it up like a sponge in order to

888
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:44,640
protect your brain

889
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:46,080
and your heart from becoming damaged by

890
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,000
the caffeine's effects of

891
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,519
triggering off your adrenals and then

892
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,120
all that epinephrine is flooding into

893
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:52,880
your bloodstream so your liver has to be

894
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:54,000
the sponge that's your mop right do you

895
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,760

do that because that's your liver you

898
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,840
should see

899
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:01,120
on the end of that mop when you're

900
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:03,679

and you know and you're mopping along

904
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:10,240

00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:12,880
that's your liver attach the bottom of

906

00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:20,159
with all that adrenaline

910
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:22,080

that adrenaline that epinephrine from

no

938
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:20,159
i'm sorry to say no it was a bad idea

939
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:21,519
there's no science behind it

940
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:23,200
and that's the thing everybody thinks

941
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:25,840
what's the science behind it no

942
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,480
it's it was a bad idea terrible idea

943
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,159
actually

944
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:30,399
people are so obsessed with their coffee

945
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:33,440
they're so obsessed with their caffeine

946
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:36,080

983
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:48,879
something new

984
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:49,599
just so you know tried something new

985
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:52,639

00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:53,760
can i eat that tuber or that shoot or

987
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:57,839
that rhizome

988
00:34:53,760 --> 00:35:00,880
can i eat that rhizome from that shrub

989
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:01,520
and then eat it and see how sick they

990
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,440
get

991
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:05,200
do they get devastatingly sick are they

992
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,839
in fetal position and vomiting for two

993
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,599
days

994
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:09,040
do they completely shut down and go

995
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:11,280
unconscious do they

996
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,960
choke and their throat just swell up and

997
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:16,960
they can't breathe and they die

998
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:21,280
right and so um your stomach

999
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:24,400
is created is made to be that buffer

1000
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:25,200
for for mistakes of survival or stupid

1001
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,640
mistakes

1002
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,920
or whatever so i'm checking the oven

1003
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,839
right now you guys bear with me in a

1004
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:34,000
second

1005
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:34,000
um those are toasting up

1006
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:40,079
they actually only need another minute

1007
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:42,000
or so and i'm gonna make a sauce make a

1008
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:45,359
hot sauce

1009
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,680
so okay back to this again so when we

1010
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:48,720
dump

1011
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:49,839
coffee poisonous effects of caffeine get

1012
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,680
buffered a little bit

1013
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:53,119
from that thick skin inside the stomach

1014
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,240
right they get buffered a little bit

1015
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:57,119
from that thick skin

1016
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,680
okay but when you put coffee up the back

1017
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:59,920
end

1018
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,720
there's no buffer it goes directly into

1019
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:03,520
your bloodstream

1020
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:05,359
to your heart into your brain and it

1021
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,640
annihilates the central nervous system

1022
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:08,320
if you're somebody with central nervous

1023
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,839

00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:36,480
whatever what up burning skin

1035
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:38,160
pain in your jaw pain in your teeth

1036
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,920
unexplained nervous system

1037
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:41,280
right floaters in the eyes nervous

1038
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:43,200

1039
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:45,119
black spots in your eyes white spots in

1040
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:47,599
your eyes all nervous system

1041
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:48,560
right so you got all these new all these

1042
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:50,800
nervous system

1043
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:51,599
conditions and symptoms out there right

1044
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,000
the worst thing

1045
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:55,599
ever is to put coffee up the back end

1046
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,359
because when you put coffee that way

1047
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:59,599
there's no buffer from that thick skin

1048
00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:03,200
from the stomach you guys

1049
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:05,520
and even that still isn't good enough

1050
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:08,400
right it just buffers it to some degree

1051
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:11,359
so it slowly gets to the brain

1052
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:12,160
and the heart versus you go the coffee

1053
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:13,680
enema

1054
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:15,839
that goes right into your bloodstream it

1055
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:18,160
hits your liver right away bam

1056
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:19,359
wax that liver not to cleanse it it

1057
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:21,839
doesn't cleanse it

1058
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:22,880
it shocks it and weakens it and disables

1059
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:24,320
it

1060
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:26,720
that's what it does when you do coffee

1061
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:28,000
enema right and then

1062
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,839
and then the caffeine gets into the

1063
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,960
bloodstream and causes a big problem i'm

1064
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:32,240
going to take that out i think that's

1065
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,839
just about getting there

1066
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:36,960
so let me just grab an oven mitt wrap it

1067
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:41,680
up you guys

1068
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:41,680
that's what i'm doing get these out

1069
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:46,400
these are toasted up nice okay so i am

1070
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:50,000
going to

1071
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:52,000
let me make the sauce and let me find a

1072
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:56,720
spot where this should go

1073
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,720
okay so maybe we can put it over here

1074
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:05,839
all right

1075
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:16,720
okay it's gonna burn on that towel but

1076
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:18,240
i'll put it there

1077
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:20,000
all right i got it right there you guys

1078
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:21,839
so i'm just i'm just gonna make a sauce

1079
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:25,359

1083
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,760
it's not that moringa is bad or anything

1084
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:42,880
it just

1085
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,880

1086
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:46,960

1130
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:11,920
because nobody knows why anybody's

1131
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,079
sick it's either people think it's your

1132
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:16,079
genes or your body's attacking itself

1133
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:17,359
or you you're making it up and you're

1134
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:20,560
lying or

1135
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:24,319
you're seeking out attention right

1136
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:26,560
nobody knows why anybody was sick okay

1137
00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:27,760
um astrid said i thought maca is for

1138
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:30,880
fertility

1139
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:31,839
um then that's made up that's just made

1140
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,760
up

1141
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:34,960
there's no scientific study that could

1142
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,880
definitively show

1143
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:38,640
that maca can help with fertility right

1144
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:42,319
there just isn't astrid so that's just

1145
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:45,280
made up and that's what happens maca

1146
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:47,040
maca came out during a time where where

1147
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:49,839
anybody

1148
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:50,800
looking for cool things neither you

1149
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:52,720
needed a cool

1150
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:54,160
name and it always took off you just

1151
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,359
need a cool name like maka took off

1152
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,640
because people were like maka what's

1153
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:58,000
maka maka maka maka

1154
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:59,760
everybody's like oh my god put it here

1155
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,280
put it there same thing with neem oil

1156
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:04,400
it's like neem oil

1157
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:05,680
neem neem all through the internet

1158
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:08,160
and then you know that's how it works

1159
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:09,760
right but neem oil

1160
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:12,400
doesn't fix your multiple sclerosis

1161
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:14,400
lupus fibromyalgia ra

1162
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:16,400
lyme disease aches and pains tingles and

1163
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,119
numbness ringing in the ears depression

1164
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,839
anxiety see

1165
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:20,560
see how it works maca doesn't either so

1166
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:23,119
it's like

1167
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:23,760
if you want somebody to get better it

1168
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:27,599
can't be

1169
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:29,280
trendy things so to speak it has to be

1170
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:31,119
something that actually works

1171
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,640
and then when it finally works then it

1172
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:35,920
takes off right

1173
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:38,720
but maca took off because of money

1174
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:39,599
money right there was no money in celery

1175
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:42,079
juice

1176
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:43,920
it was people actually healing okay and

1177
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:47,119
that's why it still survives today

1178
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:50,640
because there's not one dollar into

1179
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:52,079
a massive campaign that celery juice is

1180
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:55,680
something you need to do

1181
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:57,920
not one dollar right and so and

1182
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:59,119
it's out there healing people and

1183
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:02,640
changing lives

1184
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:05,760
because it works because celery works

1185
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:06,800
it's in you know but maca never changed

1186
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:09,520
any lives

1187
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,920
but maca had millions of dollars behind

1188
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:12,079
it

1189
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,960
to convince people it's something you

1190
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:16,720
should buy

1191
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:19,040
right kombucha tea millions of dollars

1192
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:20,560
in advertising to convince every yoga

1193
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:24,079
mama they should be

1194
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:27,040
on it right but it doesn't do anything

1195
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:28,480
so you can still be a sick yoga mama

1196
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:30,000
trying to go to yoga class

1197
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,760
with fibro and aches and pains and

1198
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,240
fatigue but

1199
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:35,599
maca or kombucha tea aren't gonna fix it

1200
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:37,599
see how it works

1201
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:39,040
but the millions of dollars behind these

1202
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:40,720
things the millions of dollars behind

1203
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,680
collagen the millions of dollars behind

1204
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:44,960
these things

1205
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:45,520
is it's it's all like it's basically a

1206
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,119
fake out

1207
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:49,920
smoke and mirrors and it's bait and

1208
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:51,920
switch it's constantly like this right

1209
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:53,040
celery juice has all the odds stacked

1210
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:55,839
against it

1211
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:56,480
every the media trying to stop it every

1212
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:58,640
single

1213
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:00,160
in the health world tries to clobber the

1214
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:02,079
crap out of it because it makes nobody

1215
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:05,040
money it just heals people

1216
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:06,880
and so it's end in medical mediums the

1217
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,920
originator so that doesn't help all on

1218
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:10,480
its own

1219
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:12,480
because people just get all bent out of

1220
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:15,520
shape about that alone right

1221
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:18,240
but celery juice lives on its own

1222
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:20,240
because it heals and heals and heals and

1223
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,560
heals and saves lives and changes lives

1224
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,720
and

1225
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:23,920
moves people forward right with no money

1226
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:25,920
can you imagine

1227
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:28,079
if you put the money that was behind

1228
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:30,000
kombucha tea and the money behind

1229
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:31,599
probiotics and the money behind any of

1230
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,599
this stuff right

1231
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:35,440
in maca whatever if you put that kind of

1232
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:37,280
money behind celery juice

1233
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:38,720
not only would there be like 500 million

1234
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,000
people drinking it right now

1235
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:41,920
naturally around the world because it

1236
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,560
works but you'd have six

1237
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:46,079
billion people drinking it if five

1238
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:48,160
billion people drinking it

1239
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:50,000
it's just it's just it's incredible how

1240
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:51,440
it works um let's make the sauce right

1241
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,240
now you guys

1242
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:57,359
i got a food processor right here just

1243
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:57,359
going to flip this around

1244
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:04,720
it's kind of a chill day we're just

1245
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:06,400
we're talking about some cool things

1246
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:08,000
guys you think it'd help if i can plug

1247
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,720
this in

1248
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,770
so which i'm gonna do

1249
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:12,770
[Music]

1250
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:16,640
so what i'm gonna do is get a little

1251
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:19,680
extension cord in a second and plug this

1252
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:21,359
food processor in so that's what i was

1253
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:23,200
saying your stomach is designed to

1254
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:26,000
handle poison

1255
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:26,800
but only certain amounts of poison to a

1256
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,200
certain degree

1257
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:31,280
the stomach can buffer but other than

1258
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,839
that we still get poisoned by things you

1259
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:34,400
know

1260
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:36,480
it's like it's like a dangerous poison

1261
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:39,599
like cyanide right

1262
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:39,920
if it goes into the stomach you'll live

1263
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:44,319
a

1264
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:47,359
half an hour longer or hour longer

1265
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:50,640
than if it was put into an enema so

1266
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:53,760
somebody put a dangerous dangerous

1267
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:54,480
poison like cyanide in an enema you

1268
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:57,680
would die

1269
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:59,119
in seconds just set two seconds and

1270
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:01,440
that's the difference if it went into

1271
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:03,440
the stomach you'll be at the hospital

1272
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:05,119
dying but you'll be a livestone that's

1273
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:08,160
the difference in how the stomach works

1274
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:10,880
so we'll go with a half cup

1275
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:12,960
of chopped red bell pepper we're making

1276
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:14,960
the hot sauce right now

1277
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:17,680
so just taking out the center right

1278
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:20,400
there there you go

1279
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:20,400
put it over here

1280
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:25,599
so i'm just going to chop this up

1281
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:31,520
these are really sharp knives i'm

1282
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:32,560
dealing with right now and like i said

1283
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:34,640
before

1284
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:36,800
be really careful with sharp knives

1285
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:39,040
because you cut yourself real easily

1286
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:40,960
um that's a massive mistake in the

1287
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:41,440
culinary world would they say that dull

1288
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:43,119
knives

1289
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:44,640
cause more injuries that's not true

1290
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:46,560
actually that's so not true

1291
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:47,839
i've seen people chop their fingers off

1292
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:50,960
with sharp knives

1293
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:51,599
and and not get injured with in you know

1294
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:54,400
with

1295
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:55,119
with adult knife steak knives are

1296
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,480
different

1297
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:58,319
okay those are different that's a whole

1298
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:00,560
nother story i'm talking about these

1299
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:03,520
type of chopping knives let's put some

1300
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:05,520
cherry tomatoes in here too

1301
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:06,720
okay you can chop up the cherry tomatoes

1302
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,839
pudding in there i'm just gonna throw

1303
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:12,160
them right in

1304
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:15,119
um third of a cup

1305
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:16,319

1328
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,839

1329
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:19,280

1330
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:25,200

1331
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:27,599

let's cut a lime

1336
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:48,079
that's not a lime that's actually juicy

1337
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:48,079
enough

1338
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:52,000

1339
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:53,359

stuff

1342
00:47:56,559 --> 00:48:02,480
you can do um a little less lime if you

1343
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:07,520
want a lot i like more lime

1344
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:09,280
there we go

1345
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:11,040
put some raw honey in here you have the

1346
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:13,119
option of maple syrup if you don't like

1347
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:16,640
honey on any level

1348
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:16,640
so you got the option of maple syrup

1349
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:24,720
just move this over

1350
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:24,720

00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:31,839
all right and i'm going to put a hot

1352
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:33,599

1354
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:37,280

1360
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:19,920
all right

1361
00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:21,440
so this is an incredible hot sauce i i

1362
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:23,839
happen to make it a lot

1363
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:25,760
people want to say what is what does aw

1364
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:29,200

1365
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:29,200

anymore

1498
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:59,920
so when the gas lighter comes by and

1499
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:01,920

know what supplements to do

1506
00:55:09,359 --> 00:55:13,200
too so that's another thing too you'll

1507
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:15,520
be gas-lit in the supplement world

1508
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:17,440
just so you know you guys in the

1509
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:20,160
supplement world right

1510
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:21,359
it is here's how it works in that world

1511
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:23,040
all right

1512
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:24,640
they're spending supplement companies

1513
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:25,599
out there right they spend millions of

1514
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:28,000
dollars

1515
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:28,640
if they're not a mom and pop they spent

1516
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,559
they spend

1517
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:32,160
millions of dollars in advertising so

1518
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:34,559
that it's shoved in your face

1519
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:36,720
everywhere okay and they don't even have
