1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:07,680
how many people do you know who struggle

2
00:00:04,279 --> 00:00:10,200
with their health chances are whether

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:14,480
they show it or not most of the people

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:17,520
in your life do and chances are you're

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:21,359
one of them whether you're dealing with

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:25,840
anxiety depression endometriosis acne

7
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:28,439
eczema autoimmune thyroid lime brain fog

8
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:31,200
fatigue or any other symptom or

9
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:34,480
condition you're far from from

10
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:38,600
alone living with symptoms has become

11
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:41,719
The New Normal so no more guessing games

12
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:45,280
it's time to get answers welcome to the

13
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:48,360
medical medium podcast I'm Anthony

14
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,480
Williams we're talking about food Wars

15
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:53,320
both sides of the food Wars are

16
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:56,480
brainwashed meanwhile they're all still

17
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:58,800
getting sick no matter what food belief

18
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,399
system someone belongs to whether

19
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,879
plant-based or animal-based or even

20
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:06,400
everything in moderation they use

21
00:01:03,879 --> 00:01:09,360
science to attack anyone who doesn't

22
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:12,680
share their belief system everybody's

23
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:15,520
fighting both sides are at War and their

24
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:17,920
eye isn't on the ball about what creates

25
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,920
chronic

26
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:25,640
illness as soon as vegans or people

27
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:28,960
eating plant-based get sick they tend to

28
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:32,280
run back to animal Foods when people on

29
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:35,600
already animal base diets get sick most

30
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,079
of them tend to stay with animal foods

31
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,119
and keep searching searching and

32
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:41,920
searching for other reasons they could

33
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:44,000
be sick or suffering there are not a lot

34
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,240
of vegan families and plant-based

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,680
families where the children are born and

36
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:52,119
bred vegan and stay that way nearly

37
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,000
everybody is raised on animal protein

38
00:01:52,119 --> 00:01:58,039
diets nearly everybody on this planet is

39
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,840
raised on animal protein in some shape

40
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:03,759
fashion or form and now that's why most

41
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,439
people who go plant-based or vegan and

42
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,880
they get sick they end up running back

43
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:10,800
to animal protein they go back to their

44
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:13,040
roots to where they came from they get

45
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:16,160
scared they get scared into it by

46
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:19,120
practitioners doctors and family members

47
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:21,200
they get scared into it by themselves

48
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,720
they start thinking I'm lacking

49
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,160
something they start thinking they're

50
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:28,200
missing something something they get

51
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:29,879
from animal protein something they get

52
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,959
from some kind of animal product and it

53
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:34,000
must be the answer to why they're sick

54
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:36,720
even though they came from animal

55
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,319
products that was their diet originally

56
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,920
they were born and raised on it and

57
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:42,440
after they went vegan for a little while

58
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,120
they're still sick or they're getting

59
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,959
sick they run back and they're like I

60
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:48,560
must be missing something maybe I should

61
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:51,120
start eating liver now and then they see

62
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,120
something on social they see a video

63
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,120
they see some material they read out

64
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,319
there and it says they should be on beef

65
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,080
Hearts that's where the nutrients are so

66
00:02:57,319 --> 00:03:01,159
they get really confused and now they're

67
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:03,680
searching for the best beef Hearts they

68
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:06,840
can find one of the interesting things

69
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:09,760
is both sides the animal-based and

70
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:12,440
plant-based believe that protein is the

71
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,400
answer for everything so when anything

72
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:17,080
goes wrong or any kind of Health

73
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,599
struggle at all happens or any kind of

74
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:21,879
deficiency they see in their blood work

75
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:24,480
when they're at the doctor's office they

76
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:26,280
instantly think protein and their

77
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,760
practitioners and doctors Healthcare

78
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:31,480
Providers say protein too so they think

79
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:33,159
protein is the an answer for everything

80
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:36,400
this partly comes from people being

81
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:39,760
raised on animal protein just the word

82
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:42,080
itself protein vegans and plant-based

83
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,400
people won't adopt this way of eating

84
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,879
unless someone convinces them in a

85
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,439
confident manner that there's protein to

86
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:52,720
be had that there's protein in a

87
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:55,120
plant-based diet which there is but both

88
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,920
animal-based and plant-based folks are

89
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:01,680
brainwashed to think it's all about

90
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:04,760
protein because protein protein sounds

91
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:07,200
scientific both sides have to feel like

92
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:09,680
their diet belief system no matter what

93
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:12,680
kind of name it has no matter how fancy

94
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:15,640
it is that it's science-based and you

95
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:19,120
can get enough protein both sides are

96
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:23,160
also conditioned and brainwashed for

97
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,160
confrontation they get into a

98
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:30,320
fight I got my money on Old

99
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:34,039
Nessie who you got your money on Albert

100
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:37,199
I got Alber is going to win I got my

101
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:39,680
whoa no get get back in the pen no

102
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,680
there's still

103
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:44,759
fighting before plant-based people

104
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:47,720
revert back to eating animal protein

105
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:50,400
diets they got to fight in them first

106
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:52,479
they fight back plant-based folks don't

107
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:55,759
just look at animal-based folks and say

108
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:58,199
hey look we're all sick instead each of

109
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:00,520
them get their weapons out they find

110
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:03,759
their weapons of choice in the form of

111
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:06,000
studies research papers both the

112
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,479
committed animal protein people and the

113
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,199
committed plant-based and vegan people

114
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:13,759
call themselves researchers now they're

115
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:15,759
all researchers they spend a lot of time

116
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,919
on the internet looking around for

117
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,680
information they throw articles at each

118
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:23,919
other's faces articles that they feel

119
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:26,400
are based on science they say this keto

120
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:30,919
study says when it isn't even a real

121
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:34,080
study it's just a survey or a uniformed

122
00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:36,440
observation or Theory theoretical paper

123
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,720
put together by somebody or anybody in

124
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:41,639
health with limited experience on the

125
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:44,800
issues or the subject and if they do

126
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:48,080
reference an actual clinical study how

127
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:50,600
reputable was it who funded it was it

128
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,800
based on a handful of paid participants

129
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:55,440
from the same age and background

130
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,840
monitored over a very short time span

131
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,840
leading to gross generalizations and

132
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:04,680
misinformation where was the study study

133
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:06,960
done was it even done the reality the

134
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:09,199
bottom line is that both sides are

135
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,919
brainwashed they're brainwashed that

136
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:14,960
they can trust the science behind their

137
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:17,240
diet they're brainwashed that protein is

138
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:20,120
everything they're brainwashed to

139
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:22,080
confront each other and fight each other

140
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:24,639
both sides of the food Wars are

141
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:27,639
brainwashed that intermittent fasting is

142
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:30,160
healthy both sides are brainwashed that

143
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:33,080
caffeine is good that adding quality

144
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:35,840
salt to food is good that apple cider

145
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:39,039
vinegar is good does that ring a bell to

146
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:41,319
anyone both sides are brainwashed that

147
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:43,759
you can fix all your problems through

148
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:46,360
breathing techniques or through

149
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:48,479
manifesting both sides are brainwashed

150
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:51,639
that chocolate is plant medicine that

151
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:53,440
it's good for you both are brainwashed

152
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:56,280
that they don't create any waste with

153
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:59,000
their food decisions and diets this is a

154
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:00,960
good one right here both are brainwashed

155
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,639
that they're diet belief systems are

156
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,879
sustainable and are all about

157
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:08,520
sustainability both sides are

158
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:10,639
conditioned to run to the conventional

159
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:13,560
doctor for antibiotics the moment they

160
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:15,720
get sick both sides are brainwashed to

161
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:18,160
believe that autoimmune symptoms a

162
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:20,240
result of the body attacking itself

163
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,440
here's another good one both sides are

164
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:26,160
brainwashed to believe that their genes

165
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:28,360
dictate why they're sick here's another

166
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:31,919
both sides are brainwashed to be afraid

167
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:34,440
of fruit so much so that even if they do

168
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:36,680
start believing fruit is okay to eat a

169
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:39,919
little more fruit each day all it could

170
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:41,639
take is one whistle from a food Brigade

171
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:44,280
that sends them right back into Fruit

172
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:48,800
fear once again here's one of my

173
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:51,479
favorites both sides have B12 iron and

174
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:54,560
calcium deficiencies while both sides

175
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:56,879
are brainwashed to believe that only

176
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,000
plant-based and vegan people are at risk

177
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:01,879
of these deficiencies not the animal-

178
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:05,400
based people both sides are worried

179
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:08,680
about vitamin D deficiency both sides

180
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:12,000
are vitamin D deficient and both sides

181
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:15,879
believe vitamin D Mega doses are the

182
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:19,199
answer both sides believe in fermented

183
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:22,479
foods both sides believe that all your

184
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:25,000
problems stem from your gut and both

185
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:27,879
sides believe that the brain is made of

186
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,800
fat and you need fat in your brain to

187
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:33,279
survive this is a great one right here

188
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:36,560
both sides believe their blood tests are

189
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:40,159
all accurate here's one for the record

190
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:42,399
books both sides unknowingly get too

191
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:45,480
much blood drawn when they get a blood

192
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:48,720
test both sides believe that a diet of

193
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:51,519
processed foods mad eating habits and

194
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,839
fried and greasy Foods was the sole

195
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:56,160
cause of any symptoms before they Chang

196
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:59,680
their diet when really there's much more

197
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:02,440
to it this is an interesting one both

198
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,959
sides believe their food choices now

199
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:07,519
make them spiritually

200
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:09,959
enlightened and my favorite both sides

201
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:12,800
believe they're very much different from

202
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:16,440
the other side that they're opposites

203
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:20,079
when they're not the funny thing is they

204
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:22,000
are the same side the same belief system

205
00:09:20,079 --> 00:09:24,560
they shop at the same markets to get

206
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,720
their food and the only difference is

207
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:30,920
that one eats meat and one doesn't still

208
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:34,240
the battle each other they fight each

209
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:38,079
other they face off against each other

210
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:41,680
and both sides use flawed science fake

211
00:09:38,079 --> 00:09:43,720
science underdeveloped science and

212
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:46,600
broken science to back up their

213
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:49,600
positions Animal product science doesn't

214
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:52,360
believe in plant-based science

215
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,839
plant-based science doesn't believe in

216
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:58,040
Animal product science these science

217
00:09:54,839 --> 00:10:00,200
entities are against each other and the

218
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:02,959
conventional mainstream Medical Science

219
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:05,279
entity does not support any of the

220
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:08,120
sciences that either plant-based or

221
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:10,000
animal-based Believers are projecting I

222
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:12,440
could just hear it now I know people are

223
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,560
going to be like no that's not true I

224
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:16,399
believe in science and my science is

225
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:19,200
good and big science believes in my

226
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:20,920
little science and my science is more

227
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,079
important than the plant-based science

228
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,600
and plant-based people are going to be

229
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,480
like no my science is more important

230
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,519
than your science that's a science to

231
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:29,160
believe in you don't need to eat meat

232
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,079
and then the meat eater is like you need

233
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:34,480
eat meat and but yet they're all the

234
00:10:31,079 --> 00:10:38,880
same on top of everything food War

235
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:41,240
Battlers go for the emotional side vegan

236
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,200
and plant-based Believers tell Animal

237
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:46,600
product Believers that they're killing

238
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:49,240
animals destroying rainforests clueless

239
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,959
that animals have souls and making their

240
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:54,040
children eat dead

241
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:56,279
animals Animal product Believers tell

242
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:58,519
vegan and plant-based Believers they're

243
00:10:56,279 --> 00:11:02,000
causing malnutrition in their babies and

244
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:05,040
children starving them of protein not

245
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,880
preparing them for quote real life and

246
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,760
keeping them away from

247
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:11,880
moderation no matter what food belief

248
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,000
system someone belongs to whether

249
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:16,480
plant-based or animal- based or even

250
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,240
everything in moderation they use

251
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:21,639
science to attack anyone who doesn't

252
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:23,800
share their belief system that any group

253
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:25,920
can find Science and data to back up

254
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:29,040
their position that science hands out

255
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:33,120
the weapons to both sides of the battle

256
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:35,639
should make us question that very War

257
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:38,720
meanwhile this whole time everybody's

258
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:41,720
fighting both sides are at War and their

259
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,880
eye isn't on the ball about what creates

260
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:46,240
chronic

261
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:49,399
illness when a person or a person's

262
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,279
child gets sideswiped or blindsided by

263
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:52,480
health

264
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:55,200
challenges and medical science and

265
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:57,600
research doesn't have an answer and

266
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,639
can't understand why they're sick

267
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,760
whatever belief system they've consume

268
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:05,279
themselves with starts to break apart

269
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:08,360
whatever diet whatever diet belief

270
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:10,959
system whatever Trend whatever they

271
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:14,040
believed in that science backed or

272
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:15,160
alternative science backed it all just

273
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:18,440
Falls to

274
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:21,800
Pieces it doesn't matter what study what

275
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:24,600
research paper what trend they first

276
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:27,760
believed in it doesn't matter what study

277
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:30,360
that convinced them to go a certain way

278
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,560
it doesn't matter what podcast doctor

279
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,959
doesn't matter what book they read that

280
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,920
seemed like it was backed up and

281
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:39,240
supported by science it all just starts

282
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:42,320
to fade away because when they get

283
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:45,680
chronically sick and there's no answers

284
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:47,880
it all falls apart when someone gets hit

285
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:50,760
with neurological Lyme multiple

286
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:52,240
sclerosis chronic fatigue syndrome or

287
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:56,000
they're dealing with some form of

288
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:58,399
anxiety that's crippling them depression

289
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,399
they got the worst brain fog they can't

290
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:03,079
function they can't be productive

291
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:05,720
they're struggling or they got bad bad

292
00:13:03,079 --> 00:13:07,959
bad digestive problems they're

293
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:11,199
constipated they're bloated they're in

294
00:13:07,959 --> 00:13:13,040
pain or they have vertigo and dizziness

295
00:13:11,199 --> 00:13:14,959
where they feel like they're on a boat

296
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,639
and they're rocking back and forth or

297
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:19,839
they're just vomiting because they have

298
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:22,000
vertigo or they got tingles and numbness

299
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:25,560
bad migraines where they can't live

300
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,760
their life because the migraines ADHD or

301
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:31,560
OCD crippling

302
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:35,040
OCD autoimmune or eating disorders when

303
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:37,959
those things start to disrupt their life

304
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:40,199
any doubts someone has had in the back

305
00:13:37,959 --> 00:13:43,480
of their mind about a plant-based diet

306
00:13:40,199 --> 00:13:47,519
or veganism starts to grow like

307
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:49,600
weeds the doubts usually take over fast

308
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,800
and once again that person goes into the

309
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,320
Land of the

310
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:56,000
Lost they go searching all over again

311
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,519
just like they were when they first

312
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,240
started searching at the beginning

313
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:01,880
looking for a direction and making a

314
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:05,519
decision to go vegan and plant-based

315
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:07,800
from the beginning some still hold on

316
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:10,120
they hold on to plant-base and veganism

317
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:12,480
beliefs and they fight for a little

318
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:14,720
while in that lost land while they're

319
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,800
sick they'll see their functional

320
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,160
medicine doctor or their plant-based

321
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:22,160
naturopath and they'll fight for it

322
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:25,079
until a family member or friend ignites

323
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:28,360
that tiny doubt that was in their head

324
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:29,360
and the doubt grows and grows into a

325
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:33,040
mean

326
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:37,560
nasty monster they defect they change

327
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:40,160
your diet belief system and poof unless

328
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:42,360
someone finds medical medium

329
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,480
information they don't know why they're

330
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:46,759
sick so they believe it's caused by

331
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,800
their diet it's not just a rookie thing

332
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:51,560
in health to believe that diet is why

333
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:54,680
you're sick it's an entrenched

334
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:57,880
conditioning an entrenched belief system

335
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:59,839
among long-term diet Believers too

336
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:02,800
people who commit MIT to their diet

337
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:06,199
belief systems believe that their diets

338
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:08,639
beforehand were the sole reason for any

339
00:15:06,199 --> 00:15:12,360
symptoms they experienced instead of

340
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:15,000
understanding pathogens heavy metals and

341
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:17,720
chemical exposure as the source of their

342
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,079
symptoms foundational landmarks of

343
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,320
medical medium

344
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:23,480
information part of the brainwashing

345
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:26,839
mechanism that's out there is when

346
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:30,519
symptoms arise and come up as they're

347
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:32,759
already following a a belief system if

348
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:35,880
it's plant-based they'll fall through

349
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:38,319
the trapo of believing they got sick

350
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:40,759
from the lack of animal products if they

351
00:15:38,319 --> 00:15:43,639
get sick on an animal-based diet on the

352
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:46,120
other hand they won't blame their diet

353
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:48,720
totally they'll be more apt to blame

354
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:50,560
factors like stress or unhappiness

355
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:53,319
they'll be more afraid of fruit than

356
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:55,759
ever before they'll feel like maybe

357
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:59,240
there's a spiritual or genetic reason

358
00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:02,079
why they're sick each side plant based

359
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:04,680
and animal-based has its underbelly

360
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:07,480
exposed plant-based Believers are more

361
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:09,639
susceptible to getting slammed about

362
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:12,120
deficiencies because they've long been

363
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:14,440
fed doubt about whether a plant-based

364
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:18,560
diet offers them all the nutrition they

365
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:20,920
need both sides are susceptible to fear

366
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,440
both sides get sick with the same types

367
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:26,279
of symptoms and

368
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:28,560
conditions once they become sick both

369
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:30,240
plant-based and animal-based believers

370
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,880
start worrying about the

371
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:36,040
microbiome bacterial overgrowth in the

372
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:39,120

a constant revolving door of trying to

get improvements from mixing and

little differently than that it's a game

384
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,959
that occupies you while your body is

385
00:17:08,679 --> 00:17:13,000
fighting for temporary results and

386
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:15,319
fighting for its life temporary

improvements and temporary relief come

388
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:20,160
for some people but it's back into the

389

game again the guessing games they don't

390
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:27,799
stop some practices can be supportive

391
00:17:23,799 --> 00:17:29,880
some not you can't be sure which or

392
00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:32,120
which because you can't read the signs

393
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:34,400
and symptoms that your body's providing

394
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:37,400
you because whether you believe in

395
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:41,480
plant-based or animal-based you don't

396
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:43,960
know why you're really sick the game

397
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:46,799
could go on for so long and go on and on

398
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:51,400
and on it could go on forever in a

399
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:53,799
person's life 10 20 50 years until they

400
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:59,120
can finally find a way

401
00:17:53,799 --> 00:18:02,960
out healing from a symptom condition or

402
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:05,760
disease isn't about choosing sides it

403
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:08,720
isn't just about going plant-based or

404
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:12,360
animal based or everything in

405
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:16,360
moderation recovery isn't going to be

406
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:17,640
Reliant upon a scientific study we may

407
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:22,000
have that

408
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:24,400
illusion in the end healing is about

409
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:28,120
understanding that we've been tricked

410
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:31,600
all along the way duped the wool has

411
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:35,280
been pulled over our eyes we've been

412
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:38,480
bamboozled healing is about learning

413
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:42,520
that all sides are continually

414
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:47,360
