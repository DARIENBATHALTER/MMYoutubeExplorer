[329.36 - 333.60] where they were
[331.04 - 336.48] it was terrible it was terrible i mean
[333.60 - 338.80] what was happening back then
[336.48 - 342.08] jennifer my brother-in-law had too much
[338.80 - 345.28] iron in his blood he had to go to blood
[342.08 - 347.36] letting station every 30 days
[345.28 - 348.32] the low-grade viral infections can do
[347.36 - 350.00] two things
[348.32 - 351.60] they can get into the spleen and now you
[350.00 - 352.96] have an infection and now
[351.60 - 355.20] this chronic infection and you're
[352.96 - 355.76] cranking the iron they get into the bone
[355.20 - 357.76] marrow
[355.76 - 359.52] you're cranking the iron they get into
[357.76 - 362.16] the liver you're cranking the iron
[359.52 - 364.00] and then you get that aspect of it or
[362.16 - 365.76] the livery viruses what they do is they
[364.00 - 366.48] get into your system and you've got low
[365.76 - 368.72] iron
[366.48 - 370.16] you've got low low iron and that's the
[368.72 - 371.36] difference pathogens see different
[370.16 - 373.44] things
[371.36 - 374.72] michelle miller says i wouldn't be here
[373.44 - 376.56] if it weren't for you anthony i'm

[377.68 - 382.16] and again it the bloodletting station is
[380.48 - 383.28] just a band-aid but it doesn't fit the
[382.16 - 385.12] problem
[383.28 - 386.72] completely understand and there's things
[385.12 - 388.32] we got to do to fix the problem
[386.72 - 390.64] you guys i'm here i'm going to talk the
[388.32 - 392.24] reason why i have the dummy with me
[390.64 - 393.84] all right the reason why i have the
[392.24 - 394.96] tick-tock dummy with me is because i
[393.84 - 396.72] want to show you guys a couple things i
[394.96 - 398.96] want to talk about why it's important
[396.72 - 401.52] to listen to the episode medical mean

[421.60 - 424.32] what i mean somebody will say to you the
[422.88 - 425.28] reason why i'm talking i have the dummy
[424.32 - 427.28] here
[425.28 - 428.88] is the reason why someone's going to say
[427.28 - 429.92] to you yet your immune system you're not
[428.88 - 431.36] going to lose your immune system if you
[429.92 - 432.40] get your blood drawn
[431.36 - 434.48] you're not going to lose your immune
[432.40 - 436.08] system if you get your blood drawn i'm a
[434.48 - 437.60] nutritionist i'm telling you that your
[436.08 - 438.88] immune system's all in your gut
[437.60 - 440.00] i'm a health coach and i'm telling you
[438.88 - 442.08] that your immune system is all in your
[440.00 - 443.20] gut because we just parrot everything we
[442.08 - 444.88] hear and see
[443.20 - 446.48] i'm just no i'm a doctor i'm telling you
[444.88 - 448.16] immune systems all in your gut
[446.48 - 450.00] well all that comes from gut health
[448.16 - 452.40] companies that sell crap and
[450.00 - 454.32] gut health uh probiotic companies that
[452.40 - 455.60] sell stuff and it's pseudoscience it's
[454.32 - 457.44] pseudoscience
[455.60 - 459.44] real science doesn't even believe in
[457.44 - 460.48] that science that's pseudoscience it's
[459.44 - 463.44] gut health
[460.48 - 464.96] companies create this pseudoscience so
[463.44 - 467.76] they can somehow have
[464.96 - 469.36] something behind their gut product that
[467.76 - 470.48] spreads and gets out there
[469.36 - 472.16] and then you're going to be like well
[470.48 - 473.12] the immune system's in the gut it's not
[472.16 - 474.56] in the gut
[473.12 - 476.24] and i got the dummy here because i want
[474.56 - 478.64] to talk to you guys about this stuff
[476.24 - 479.28] paige i almost died from a huge blood
[478.64 - 482.80] draw

[489.36 - 492.32] to protect yourself you must listen to
[491.20 - 494.80] the episode right
[492.32 - 496.00] you must listen to the the blood draw
[494.80 - 497.20] episode um
[496.00 - 498.56] medical medium the link is in
[497.20 - 499.68] description you guys share it with
[498.56 - 501.84] everybody you know okay
[499.68 - 504.40] even if they don't like me i don't like
[501.84 - 507.04] that guy he's the medical medium
[504.40 - 509.28] you know i don't like them whatever
[507.04 - 510.08] listen to this episode you don't like
[509.28 - 511.44] them fine but
[510.08 - 513.84] listen to this episode because it can
[511.44 - 516.40] protect you your family save your life
[513.84 - 517.12] you don't have to like me um to save
[516.40 - 519.84] your life
[517.12 - 521.52] kathy do you gain immune cells with
[519.84 - 524.08] transfusion
[521.52 - 524.88] great question the immune cells they try
[524.08 - 526.72] to work
[524.88 - 528.16] they try to work when you get an
[526.72 - 529.92] infusion okay so
[528.16 - 531.76] so when someone else's immune cells are
[529.92 - 533.84] in the blood and you get the blood but
[531.76 - 535.44] it doesn't normally line up that way so
[533.84 - 538.32] it doesn't work that way
[535.44 - 540.40] sometimes sometimes they're well first
[538.32 - 543.44] of all they diminish over time and then
[540.40 - 545.44] your your immune cells take over so your
[543.44 - 547.04] immune cells take over your bone marrow
[545.44 - 549.20] produces more immune cells
[547.04 - 551.44] and then but but your immune cells can
[549.20 - 554.64] live in that blood they can live
[551.44 - 555.76] in the blood of another person right so
[554.64 - 557.76] so then when you get your blood
[555.76 - 560.32] transfusion your immune cells that
[557.76 - 562.16] that develop fill that new fresh blood
[560.32 - 565.12] okay and then the old immune cells
[562.16 - 567.84] that were that were basically um
[565.12 - 569.68] stationed for that other human being
[567.84 - 571.12] they don't work the same way in your
[569.68 - 572.88] body as they would work in someone
[571.12 - 573.84] else's body even if the blood type is
[572.88 - 574.96] the same
[573.84 - 577.04] but still doesn't matter blood
[574.96 - 578.64] transfusions are are important or
[577.04 - 580.16] critical and they still give you all
[578.64 - 580.88] these other things that give you glucose
[580.16 - 582.16] they give you
[580.88 - 584.80] they give you iron they give you all
[582.16 - 586.72] these other things
[584.80 - 588.80] leanne i had a huge blood draw in
[586.72 - 591.92] december and then crashed
[588.80 - 594.08] in a big way in february two rounds of
[591.92 - 595.60] the advance 369 saved me thank you
[594.08 - 597.76] anthony see
[595.60 - 599.28] look how important the blood draw
[597.76 - 602.40] information is
[599.28 - 605.04] and if i wasn't censored and suppressed
[602.40 - 607.36] okay where you know the platforms they
[605.04 - 609.20] kick everybody off my platforms and it's
[607.36 - 610.88] lucky i even have anybody on here now
[609.20 - 611.28] any of you guys you're not just booted
[610.88 - 613.76] off
[611.28 - 614.88] like on ig everybody's just booted off
[613.76 - 617.20] and
[614.88 - 618.00] if it wasn't for the censorship you know
[617.20 - 620.40] this stuff would get
[618.00 - 621.92] out even faster to save more lives but
[620.40 - 624.96] it's it's hard to get it
[621.92 - 625.84] out into the world um so but the good
[624.96 - 627.68] news is i
[625.84 - 628.88] put some of that blood draw information
[627.68 - 632.08] in the medical medium
[628.88 - 633.12] new edition and that is going to be out
[632.08 - 634.56] there millions of people are going to
[633.12 - 636.64] have this in their hands so that's the
[634.56 - 639.68] good news at least there's a way
[636.64 - 640.64] freedom of the press there's a way to
[639.68 - 643.44] get
[640.64 - 644.96] you know that this freedom of speech in
[643.44 - 646.88] the book to get it out
[644.96 - 648.24] and they're not burning books yet so
[646.88 - 648.96] they're not burning books yet they're
[648.24 - 650.72] definitely
[648.96 - 652.24] suppressing everybody in different ways
[650.72 - 653.44] but they're not burning books yet so we
[652.24 - 654.40] can still get the information out there
[653.44 - 655.84] and you guys are
[654.40 - 659.60] spreading and sharing the information
[655.84 - 660.40] too i talk about blood donating blood
[659.60 - 663.12] donations
[660.40 - 664.88] in this episode okay so medical mean
[663.12 - 666.16] podcast at apple podcast link is in the
[664.88 - 668.64] description do
[666.16 - 670.00] not miss this episode whatever you guys
[668.64 - 672.08] do if you're new here
[670.00 - 675.60] please listen to it okay it's at medical
[672.08 - 678.00] even podcast at apple podcast
[675.60 - 680.48] so i talk about pregnancy withdrawing
[678.00 - 682.32] blood how to rebuild your blood i talk
[680.48 - 684.32] about blood donations how to do it right
[682.32 - 686.64] how to protect yourself if you must
[684.32 - 688.40] donate and if that's what you want to do
[686.64 - 690.48] i talk about how
[688.40 - 691.92] how to do that how to protect yourself
[690.48 - 695.36] which is important
[691.92 - 696.16] christie moore michota's healing yes i
[695.36 - 698.32] know i was
[696.16 - 700.32] wondering though after the podcast we
[698.32 - 701.28] lost our immune system when blood gets
[700.32 - 703.92] taken
[701.28 - 704.88] so in order sorry in other words we lose
[703.92 - 707.36] our immune system
[704.88 - 708.24] during our periods too right it's much
[707.36 - 709.92] different
[708.24 - 712.08] much different because you're not
[709.92 - 714.48] bleeding as much blood in your period
[712.08 - 717.92] and that's a natural process in life
[714.48 - 719.60] having a needle go into your vein okay
[717.92 - 721.52] and drawing out a large amount of blood
[719.60 - 723.28] is not a natural process at all
[721.52 - 725.12] so that's the difference okay because
[723.28 - 725.92] your immune system floating around your
[725.12 - 728.80] bloodstream
[725.92 - 729.68] is doing its job right and your immune
[728.80 - 731.52] system
[729.68 - 732.88] that's in your reproductive system is
[731.52 - 735.20] doing its job
[732.88 - 736.00] but there's that's the natural process
[735.20 - 738.40] you lose
[736.00 - 740.72] some blood but you're losing more than
[738.40 - 744.24] blood through your menstruation cycle
[740.72 - 746.32] you're losing the lining of the uterus
[744.24 - 747.28] the shedding of the lining of the uterus
[746.32 - 749.28] you're losing that
[747.28 - 750.72] okay there's also mucus that comes out
[749.28 - 754.16] with the blood
[750.72 - 756.72] and the fluid with the blood too
[754.16 - 758.16] so it's not as much blood it's it's not
[756.72 - 761.36] even a fraction of blood
[758.16 - 762.16] and that's the difference okay and that
[761.36 - 764.64] right there
[762.16 - 765.92] also weakens the immune system of women
[764.64 - 769.44] that's the other point too
[765.92 - 771.52] so so menstruation is when
[769.44 - 772.64] your immune system does drop so that's
[771.52 - 773.92] what happens with women
[772.64 - 776.08] their immune systems drop during
[773.92 - 778.00] menstruation and then as it drops during
[776.08 - 780.00] menstruation they get their acne back
[778.00 - 781.12] they get their migraines back they get
[780.00 - 783.12] symptoms
[781.12 - 784.48] all this other thing that happens okay
[783.12 - 786.40] and so um
[784.48 - 788.24] 80 of the immune system runs to the
[786.40 - 790.72] reproductive system to protect the
[788.24 - 793.12] reproductive system when you bleed
[790.72 - 794.48] a little bit with your uh with your
[793.12 - 796.40] cycle but you've got to listen to the
[794.48 - 798.32] podcast i talk all about it
[796.40 - 800.00] um but when you lose too much blood
[798.32 - 801.68] during a cycle then it's a concern
[800.00 - 803.12] why is it a concern why are the doctors
[801.68 - 805.68] worried how come
[803.12 - 806.88] when you're losing a lot of blood during
[805.68 - 808.64] a menstruation cycle
[806.88 - 810.88] right where it's abnormal and you're
[808.64 - 812.48] like oh my god i'm just i'm i feel like
[810.88 - 813.36] i'm hemorrhaging or something i'm losing
[812.48 - 815.92] so much blood
[813.36 - 817.20] and now the doctors are really worried
[815.92 - 819.12] well guess what
[817.20 - 820.24] they're not worried when they take 70
[819.12 - 822.64] milliliters
[820.24 - 823.84] 80 milliliters 140 milliliters 240
[822.64 - 826.56] milliliters
[823.84 - 827.20] 300 milliliters that's 30 tubes 30 vials
[826.56 - 828.80] of blood
[827.20 - 830.64] 300 milliliters they're not worried at
[828.80 - 832.16] all taking out of you at all
[830.64 - 833.84] you go donate blood they're going to
[832.16 - 834.88] take 500 milliliters out they're not
[833.84 - 838.16] worried at all
[834.88 - 839.92] 120 pound female chronically ill goes to
[838.16 - 840.64] donate blood who doesn't feel that great
[839.92 - 842.64] overall
[840.64 - 844.40] she donates blood she loses a pint of
[842.64 - 847.04] blood they're not worried there
[844.40 - 848.40] no one's worried but the minute your
[847.04 - 849.84] cycle you're starting to lose a little
[848.40 - 851.76] too much what they're like
[849.84 - 853.68] scared crap the doctor's like oh my god
[851.76 - 855.28] we have to you're losing some blood
[853.68 - 856.80] but they don't care when they draw it
[855.28 - 857.20] all out if you see the difference these
[856.80 - 858.48] are just
[857.20 - 860.88] these are just some of the difference dr
[858.48 - 863.68] faun md he's not saying to not
[860.88 - 864.64] do blood tests he says let them take
[863.68 - 866.32] less
[864.64 - 868.40] exactly and if you hear the podcast
[866.32 - 870.72] you'll know why and how
[868.40 - 872.56] it's important to know i'm not saying
[870.72 - 873.60] don't get a blood test but the system's
[872.56 - 875.84] broken
[873.60 - 878.08] and i'll give you a little demonstration
[875.84 - 881.44] with the white blood cell
[878.08 - 885.44] when we tap into those veins okay
[881.44 - 888.56] we tap into those veins we're taking
[885.44 - 890.32] your white count your red count we're
[888.56 - 894.96] taking your cbc
[890.32 - 898.00] cbc see you later bye cbc
[894.96 - 898.96] bye gone we take your cbc and that's
[898.00 - 900.00] what happens here
[898.96 - 901.44] okay if you're wondering why i have all
[900.00 - 903.44] the goodies here i got a chocolate chip
[901.44 - 904.00] cookie here i got a half a hard-boiled
[903.44 - 907.04] egg
[904.00 - 907.52] i got a chicken piece of chicken and i
[907.04 - 910.16] got an
[907.52 - 912.24] ice cream on a stick we're going to talk
[910.16 - 915.68] about that in a second
[912.24 - 917.36] um so you lose your immune system when
[915.68 - 919.60] you get those big blood draws
[917.36 - 920.72] and the blood lab doesn't even use a
[919.60 - 923.20] fraction of that
[920.72 - 923.76] just not even a frat i mean such a small
[923.20 - 926.08] amount
[923.76 - 929.28] you throw it all away or it goes off
[926.08 - 931.44] somewhere else on the black market
[929.28 - 933.20] so and our immune system doesn't build
[931.44 - 934.40] fast it doesn't build fast it doesn't
[933.20 - 936.32] build back in one day
[934.40 - 938.08] doesn't build back in three days when
[936.32 - 940.56] you get a blood draw even five
[938.08 - 942.00] vials a blood draw you're waiting weeks
[940.56 - 944.32] to get your immune system back
[942.00 - 945.76] so then if you've got some kind of viral
[944.32 - 948.48] issue or some kind of
[945.76 - 949.60] streptococcus bacteria if you've got a
[948.48 - 951.44] little bit of that
[949.60 - 954.16] some for some reason right a little bit
[951.44 - 956.64] of strep bacteria in your system to say
[954.16 - 958.24] is why i have the dummy with me say you
[956.64 - 961.12] got chronic sinusitis
[958.24 - 963.20] so chronic sinusitis well that's
[961.12 - 965.52] streptococcus bacteria
[963.20 - 967.52] lodged in your sinus cavities causes
[965.52 - 968.56] scar tissue get people get surgeries
[967.52 - 970.16] because of it they don't know it's
[968.56 - 973.52] strapped but that's what it is
[970.16 - 976.72] so you got your streptococcus bacteria
[973.52 - 978.56] lodged in the sinus cavities well what
[976.72 - 981.12] happens is your immune system
[978.56 - 982.48] okay your immune system's keeping
[981.12 - 985.12] everything at bay
[982.48 - 986.96] keeping everything good right and you
[985.12 - 988.16] start removing your immune system
[986.96 - 989.84] now you're set up for a new
[988.16 - 991.84] streptococcus infection and now you've
[989.84 - 993.52] got a bad sinus infection three weeks
[991.84 - 997.20] later but don't know why
[993.52 - 998.88] that's just one example immune system
[997.20 - 1000.64] doesn't rebuild in just a week
[998.88 - 1002.24] it could take four to six weeks it could
[1000.64 - 1003.76] take three to six months depending on
[1002.24 - 1005.68] variables who you are
[1003.76 - 1007.28] what kind of condition you're in if you
[1005.68 - 1009.52] already have a weakened immune system
[1007.28 - 1010.48] and if you've got some fibro and some ms
[1009.52 - 1013.52] and you've got
[1010.48 - 1015.20] eczema psoriasis and you got ra and i
[1013.52 - 1016.48] talk all about this in the podcast and
[1015.20 - 1017.60] guess what
[1016.48 - 1019.28] you're already dealing with a weakened
[1017.60 - 1020.88] immune system that you have to fix and
[1019.28 - 1021.28] heal and do all the right stuff and
[1020.88 - 1023.44] learn
[1021.28 - 1025.84] talk about the new edition check it out
[1023.44 - 1025.84] okay
[1026.08 - 1030.88] and sonja i recently had a bone marrow
[1030.00 - 1033.84] transplant
[1030.88 - 1036.32] and have statistics that show my blood
[1033.84 - 1040.72] building through my weekly draws this
[1036.32 - 1042.56] includes wbcs neutrophils platelets bone
[1040.72 - 1044.40] marrow will replace
[1042.56 - 1046.56] lost blood because it desires
[1044.40 - 1048.48] homeostasis all blood cells have
[1046.56 - 1050.84] lifespan and are constantly being
[1048.48 - 1053.84] replaced with new young healthy vibrant
[1050.84 - 1053.84] cells
[1054.48 - 1057.28] okay so
[1058.80 - 1064.40] also i knew what each tube was being
[1061.44 - 1066.96] drawn for which tests
[1064.40 - 1070.00] with which color tube to the
[1066.96 - 1071.76] phlebotomist only fills them half full
[1070.00 - 1073.12] i like celery juice and don't trust big
[1071.76 - 1076.56] pharma but this is
[1073.12 - 1079.68] not but this but this take is not it
[1076.56 - 1080.08] um a couple things first of all just so
[1079.68 - 1083.04] you know
[1080.08 - 1084.08] right so when someone has cancer okay
[1083.04 - 1086.00] and they're getting blood draws
[1084.08 - 1089.04] constantly losing their white count
[1086.00 - 1091.60] that attacks cancer cells and
[1089.04 - 1093.36] the bone marrow issue that you're taking
[1091.60 - 1095.60] the bone marrow with producing like
[1093.36 - 1096.80] often replenishing your blood so quickly
[1095.60 - 1099.20] is not true
[1096.80 - 1100.56] even science research will tell you when
[1099.20 - 1103.60] you donate blood
[1100.56 - 1105.60] you're four to six six weeks out for
[1103.60 - 1107.36] your red count to come back
[1105.60 - 1109.76] just letting you know you're four to six
[1107.36 - 1113.04] weeks at least
[1109.76 - 1114.48] so science and research like the head of
[1113.04 - 1118.64] science and research
[1114.48 - 1121.84] okay dictates that with a blood donation
[1118.64 - 1124.72] you're four to six weeks out of getting
[1121.84 - 1126.48] your red blood cells back up to par
[1124.72 - 1127.92] just giving you that one right there to
[1126.48 - 1131.60] begin with
[1127.92 - 1133.36] that's at least four to six weeks okay
[1131.60 - 1136.24] of course you're gonna get white blood
[1133.36 - 1137.92] cells popping out of your spleen
[1136.24 - 1139.68] immediately that were stored in your
[1137.92 - 1142.08] spleen right when you
[1139.68 - 1142.88] get a right when you get um any kind of
[1142.08 - 1146.16] procedure
[1142.88 - 1148.72] or blood drawn or um
[1146.16 - 1149.76] or anything like that okay so but the
[1148.72 - 1152.88] thing is is that
[1149.76 - 1154.72] your bone marrow has to go on overload
[1152.88 - 1156.88] to produce those cells
[1154.72 - 1157.92] and it doesn't produce them all
[1156.88 - 1160.80] perfectly
[1157.92 - 1162.40] because you have stored cells in certain
[1160.80 - 1163.68] places right you have them stored in
[1162.40 - 1165.12] your spleen
[1163.68 - 1167.52] you have them stored in other areas of
[1165.12 - 1170.24] the body and those are your reserves
[1167.52 - 1171.68] now you're lucky if you're seeing
[1170.24 - 1173.12] anything like that
[1171.68 - 1175.44] but then you got somebody with lyme
[1173.12 - 1176.32] disease and they're getting their blood
[1175.44 - 1178.72] draws
[1176.32 - 1179.52] okay and they're getting worse and worse
[1178.72 - 1181.20] and worse
[1179.52 - 1182.80] and neurological symptoms are getting
[1181.20 - 1184.64] worse and worse and worse
[1182.80 - 1186.64] and you're getting somebody with c with
[1184.64 - 1188.00] with me cfs and their symptoms are
[1186.64 - 1190.16] getting worse and worse as they're
[1188.00 - 1192.80] taking seven vials 14 vials
[1190.16 - 1194.24] 28 vials 30 vials okay and their
[1192.80 - 1196.16] symptoms are getting worse and worse and
[1194.24 - 1197.52] worse finally they're bedridden
[1196.16 - 1199.44] because their immune system has been
[1197.52 - 1201.76] removed and
[1199.44 - 1203.12] they're low-grade viral infections that
[1201.76 - 1204.24] give them all their different symptoms
[1203.12 - 1206.96] aches and pains tingles
[1204.24 - 1208.16] numbness fatigue twitches spasms burning
[1206.96 - 1211.20] skin
[1208.16 - 1214.24] brain fog eye floaters vertigo
[1211.20 - 1217.28] is getting worse worse worse worse okay
[1214.24 - 1218.00] and people like that they can lose
[1217.28 - 1219.52] everything
[1218.00 - 1221.92] okay you should listen to the podcast
[1219.52 - 1224.40] episode to hear all the information
[1221.92 - 1224.96] really important to know but don't
[1224.40 - 1227.84] assume
[1224.96 - 1229.84] that our our bone marrow just replaces
[1227.84 - 1232.56] it all every time we draw it out
[1229.84 - 1234.32] um that's not true it's just not true
[1232.56 - 1236.00] it's not
[1234.32 - 1237.68] because each person has a different
[1236.00 - 1239.76] story so
[1237.68 - 1241.68] most people with autoimmune have a
[1239.76 - 1242.80] weakened immune system already so what
[1241.68 - 1244.64] does that mean
[1242.80 - 1246.24] weakened immune system because they're
[1244.64 - 1247.12] already diagnosed with an autoimmune
[1246.24 - 1248.72] condition
[1247.12 - 1251.36] and if they already have a weakened
[1248.72 - 1255.04] immune system that means we have a bone
[1251.36 - 1258.00] marrow issue to some degree
[1255.04 - 1258.72] where we're not producing what we need
[1258.00 - 1260.80] to
[1258.72 - 1262.96] need to produce on the level we need to
[1260.80 - 1264.56] produce to keep up with what's happening
[1262.96 - 1265.36] inside the body so you got to keep that
[1264.56 - 1267.12] in mind
[1265.36 - 1268.56] so anybody with any kind of autoimmune
[1267.12 - 1271.36] condition at all
[1268.56 - 1272.96] that happens jim says in my experience
[1271.36 - 1275.12] if the blood is dark purple
[1272.96 - 1276.80] almost black it would not hurt to lose a
[1275.12 - 1278.80] couple few tubes
[1276.80 - 1280.08] of dirty blood refreshed with clear
[1278.80 - 1281.84] eating habits
[1280.08 - 1283.12] agree not good to draw blood with
[1281.84 - 1285.60] cancerous conditions
[1283.12 - 1286.72] fasting can save you your life as long
[1285.60 - 1290.24] as the cancer
[1286.72 - 1293.92] is not too advanced um
[1290.24 - 1295.12] so first of all they're not doing two
[1293.92 - 1296.96] vials jim so
[1295.12 - 1298.24] it's not doing two vials that's not
[1296.96 - 1300.24] usually what happens
[1298.24 - 1301.76] you get sick you don't feel good it's
[1300.24 - 1303.04] five vials you get sick you don't feel
[1301.76 - 1304.72] good at seven vials
[1303.04 - 1306.16] get sick you don't feel good it's 14
[1304.72 - 1308.08] vials then you're at now you're at a
[1306.16 - 1309.84] specialist and it's 20 vials
[1308.08 - 1311.36] that specialist after you're burnt out
[1309.84 - 1313.12] that specialist and that specialist
[1311.36 - 1314.72] burnt out you six months later
[1313.12 - 1316.64] after you've already dumped about 20
[1314.72 - 1318.00] vials three times with that specialist
[1316.64 - 1319.44] now you're off to a new specialist but
[1318.00 - 1320.72] he doesn't care about all the blood work
[1319.44 - 1322.24] you just had so he's going to pull
[1320.72 - 1324.32] another 20 vials
[1322.24 - 1325.44] and another 28 vials and another 40
[1324.32 - 1327.84] vials okay
[1325.44 - 1328.48] this is killing women this is killing
[1327.84 - 1331.36] women
[1328.48 - 1334.56] so what happens is they'll draw 20 40
[1331.36 - 1336.56] vials out of a 120 pound female
[1334.56 - 1339.04] they'll sin they'll draw the same amount
[1336.56 - 1341.84] of blood out of a 250 pound
[1339.04 - 1343.28] male okay so you got a female that's
[1341.84 - 1345.36] sick with chronic illness
[1343.28 - 1347.84] could barely function severe chronic
[1345.36 - 1350.40] fatigue 122 pounds
[1347.84 - 1352.40] and they'll draw 30 tubes out of her and
[1350.40 - 1355.52] you've got a 220 pound male
[1352.40 - 1357.76] and they'll draw 32 30 tubes out of him
[1355.52 - 1359.44] and so you know there's there's a lot of
[1357.76 - 1361.12] problems that need to address it's not
[1359.44 - 1362.80] as simple as how you got some dark
[1361.12 - 1364.56] you got some dark blood it'd be good to
[1362.80 - 1366.56] draw it a couple of vials
[1364.56 - 1367.84] fresh blood coming in the reason why
[1366.56 - 1370.40] it's dark is because
[1367.84 - 1372.16] the liver is toxic number one and the
[1370.40 - 1374.64] blood is dehydrated
[1372.16 - 1375.52] that's why so if your blood comes out
[1374.64 - 1379.92] dark purple
[1375.52 - 1383.20] dark dark dark color red really dark
[1379.92 - 1385.28] that is the chronic dehydration so
[1383.20 - 1386.24] just giving you that information so you
[1385.28 - 1388.40] can protect yourself
[1386.24 - 1389.52] all on its own it's chronic dehydration
[1388.40 - 1392.16] and a dirty liver
[1389.52 - 1393.92] you can pull out that blood all you want
[1392.16 - 1394.96] fresh blood just doesn't come in and
[1393.92 - 1396.96] you're all fine
[1394.96 - 1398.96] your liver is toxic stagnant sluggish
[1396.96 - 1400.88] and dirty and your blood's dehydrated so
[1398.96 - 1403.20] you got to go into hydration and then
[1400.88 - 1405.52] you gotta go cleaning up the liver and
[1403.20 - 1408.24] fasting doesn't fix everything
[1405.52 - 1408.72] it doesn't uh and there's a big history
[1408.24 - 1411.60] to that
[1408.72 - 1412.40] okay and uh fasting doesn't fix
[1411.60 - 1415.28] everything
[1412.40 - 1416.00] i've seen fasting hurt people too it's
[1415.28 - 1419.12] not just fix
[1416.00 - 1419.60] them deplete them and hurt them so i've
[1419.12 - 1421.92] seen
[1419.60 - 1423.20] fasting do that to people you know
[1421.92 - 1425.44] deplete them
[1423.20 - 1427.04] they lose all their neurotransmitters
[1425.44 - 1430.48] all their electrolytes
[1427.04 - 1430.96] they lose it all and i never recommend
[1430.48 - 1432.56] for
[1430.96 - 1434.96] central nervous system conditions like
[1432.56 - 1436.24] neurological symptoms for people to fast
[1434.96 - 1438.72] long at all so
[1436.24 - 1440.08] any kind of fasting long term while
[1438.72 - 1440.80] you're dealing with neurological
[1440.08 - 1443.92] symptoms
[1440.80 - 1444.96] can be disastrous and dangerous so
[1443.92 - 1446.72] there's a lot of
[1444.96 - 1448.32] a lot of problems with a lot of that
[1446.72 - 1450.40] stuff it's like
[1448.32 - 1451.92] yeah there is something you said about
[1450.40 - 1455.12] fasting emergency
[1451.92 - 1456.00] cases small amounts of time but it's
[1455.12 - 1458.32] another things that
[1456.00 - 1459.92] you're fasting long term and you just
[1458.32 - 1461.84] don't understand how the body works it's
[1459.92 - 1463.28] a whole other thing too all on its own
[1461.84 - 1465.76] look i'm not saying that you don't have
[1463.28 - 1468.56] some good info somewhere that's not it
[1465.76 - 1470.96] but we're talking 35 years experiencing
[1468.56 - 1472.72] i've seen everybody fast under the sun
[1470.96 - 1474.40] i've done long-term water fast because i
[1472.72 - 1476.48] wanted to do it spiritually
[1474.40 - 1477.68] okay so i've done really long-term water
[1476.48 - 1480.56] fasting
[1477.68 - 1482.00] really long-term water fasting not
[1480.56 - 1485.04] because of a condition
[1482.00 - 1485.52] because spiritually doing it okay and i
[1485.04 - 1488.40] did that
[1485.52 - 1489.12] okay but i was strong as an ox when i
[1488.40 - 1491.52] did that
[1489.12 - 1492.96] so when i did long-term water fasting
[1491.52 - 1496.48] for fun
[1492.96 - 1498.80] i did it while strong as an ox
[1496.48 - 1500.56] and not only strong as an ox for
[1498.80 - 1503.36] spiritual reasons
[1500.56 - 1504.96] but i would i when it comes down to
[1503.36 - 1506.32] people they got neurological symptoms
[1504.96 - 1508.16] they got cfs
[1506.32 - 1510.00] they got bad fibro they got multiple
[1508.16 - 1511.60] sclerosis they got lupus they got aches
[1510.00 - 1514.64] and pains they got other problems
[1511.60 - 1517.60] that are not just that they got
[1514.64 - 1518.96] they got depression anxiety long-term
[1517.60 - 1522.08] fasting
[1518.96 - 1523.36] not not good little short clips here and
[1522.08 - 1525.52] there one day
[1523.36 - 1527.68] but doing it right two days doing it
[1525.52 - 1528.00] right if there's a really good reason
[1527.68 - 1531.76] for
[1528.00 - 1534.88] it um but anyway
[1531.76 - 1536.08] it's all good stuff so uh
[1534.88 - 1537.68] okay you guys i'm talking about the
[1536.08 - 1539.28] medical media podcast apple podcast
[1537.68 - 1540.56] check out that episode
[1539.28 - 1542.48] um we're gonna talk about some other
[1540.56 - 1545.52] things really quick right here too so
[1542.48 - 1546.96] um let's go into that so here's the
[1545.52 - 1548.56] here's how it works okay your immune
[1546.96 - 1550.48] system is not all in your gut
[1548.56 - 1552.24] just we got to clear that up right now
[1550.48 - 1554.64] okay because that's the new thing
[1552.24 - 1555.36] missed information that's trendy that's
[1554.64 - 1557.44] always
[1555.36 - 1560.00] out there because money is behind it you
[1557.44 - 1563.20] just gotta know every single trend
[1560.00 - 1564.96] out there that gets out there and it's
[1563.20 - 1566.88] pounding its way out there like your
[1564.96 - 1567.28] immune system is all in your gut is only
[1566.88 - 1570.24] done
[1567.28 - 1572.00] or sold or propelled by gut health
[1570.24 - 1573.28] companies and probiotic companies and
[1572.00 - 1574.88] that's how they do it
[1573.28 - 1576.56] and they find some pseudoscience in
[1574.88 - 1577.92] order to do that pseudoscience is just
[1576.56 - 1580.64] science they pay for
[1577.92 - 1582.00] to back up their little claim that this
[1580.64 - 1583.76] product is good for them
[1582.00 - 1585.52] and then they go with a theory and they
[1583.76 - 1586.80] don't even have the science to prove it
[1585.52 - 1587.60] and you just go with a theory the immune
[1586.80 - 1588.88] system is all
[1587.60 - 1591.12] and you're good you say well there's
[1588.88 - 1592.24] trillions of microorganisms in the gut
[1591.12 - 1594.00] so if there's trillions of
[1592.24 - 1595.36] microorganisms in the intestinal tract
[1594.00 - 1596.80] and the colon
[1595.36 - 1598.64] small intestinal tract and there's
[1596.80 - 1600.40] trillions of microorganisms
[1598.64 - 1602.16] then we that's that's where the immune
[1600.40 - 1603.52] system is but that's not your immune
[1602.16 - 1605.60] system
[1603.52 - 1606.96] in fact far from it okay your immune
[1605.60 - 1608.40] system is
[1606.96 - 1609.92] first of all in your bloodstream that's
[1608.40 - 1610.80] your number one place so when you get
[1609.92 - 1613.20] your blood draw
[1610.80 - 1614.64] you lose your number one most important
[1613.20 - 1615.60] immune system now why is it in the
[1614.64 - 1617.76] bloodstream
[1615.60 - 1619.52] it's in the bloodstream to protect what
[1617.76 - 1620.40] right here it's in the bloodstream to
[1619.52 - 1623.92] protect your
[1620.40 - 1625.52] brain okay that's why that's why your
[1623.92 - 1627.84] immune system's in your bloodstream
[1625.52 - 1628.80] it's to protect your brain critical this
[1627.84 - 1630.48] is why
[1628.80 - 1631.92] someone you hear about this all the time
[1630.48 - 1634.56] i hear about this all the time too do
[1631.92 - 1636.64] you hear about this i got to tell you
[1634.56 - 1638.72] jane says people go seek someone that
[1636.64 - 1640.48] has proper credentials like a doctor of
[1638.72 - 1642.48] an acupuncture a chinese medicine
[1640.48 - 1644.80] functional medicine practitioner and a
[1642.48 - 1646.48] doctor of natural naturopathy
[1644.80 - 1648.64] not this person who has no medical
[1646.48 - 1649.36] background or extensive training in
[1648.64 - 1652.24] nutrition
[1649.36 - 1653.92] pathology anatomy you yeah you think
[1652.24 - 1655.20] you're probably really smart to say that
[1653.92 - 1656.72] too i bet huh
[1655.20 - 1658.40] it's really great you see the
[1656.72 - 1659.68] cardiologist that's on this book right
[1658.40 - 1660.64] here this number one new york times
[1659.68 - 1662.32] bestselling book
[1660.64 - 1663.44] do you see that cardiologist that's on
[1662.32 - 1665.20] here and the other doctors that are
[1663.44 - 1666.56] actually in the books do you see that
[1665.20 - 1668.08] there's clinics there's doctors all
[1666.56 - 1670.24] around the world using the medical being
[1668.08 - 1672.16] books did you know science and research
[1670.24 - 1673.92] plagiarizes the information out of these
[1672.16 - 1675.92] books it was published here first
[1673.92 - 1677.28] fact i don't know if you like that
[1675.92 - 1678.48] science research has taken all the
[1677.28 - 1679.44] information from the medical medium
[1678.48 - 1682.08] books
[1679.44 - 1684.16] uh how do you feel about that right
[1682.08 - 1685.20] that's that's another thing too plus 35
[1684.16 - 1687.60] years experience
[1685.20 - 1688.88] and guess what that's really funny
[1687.60 - 1690.56] because
[1688.88 - 1692.72] guess who's come to me all these years
[1690.56 - 1695.04] the most powerful people in the world
[1692.72 - 1696.48] okay because they went to 50 doctors
[1695.04 - 1698.72] they had
[1696.48 - 1700.08] you know hundreds of millions of dollars
[1698.72 - 1701.68] they couldn't get answers from their
[1700.08 - 1702.96] doctors the best specialists they flew
[1701.68 - 1705.28] around the world to see
[1702.96 - 1706.00] but they had to come to me for answers
[1705.28 - 1708.16] huh
[1706.00 - 1709.04] really interesting real really
[1708.16 - 1711.20] interesting
[1709.04 - 1712.72] and that's just one thing all on its own
[1711.20 - 1714.40] plus there's millions of healing stories
[1712.72 - 1715.60] around the world of people getting their
[1714.40 - 1718.88] lives back
[1715.60 - 1720.88] huh it's another one too think about it
[1718.88 - 1722.88] and um but i i look i respect what
[1720.88 - 1724.40] you're saying okay you're saying hey
[1722.88 - 1726.32] don't listen to this guy listen to a
[1724.40 - 1727.68] doctor okay tell that to someone who's
[1726.32 - 1728.56] chronically ill and they've seen 10
[1727.68 - 1731.44] doctors
[1728.56 - 1733.04] 20 doctors 10 neurologists specialists
[1731.44 - 1734.88] and they don't have answers
[1733.04 - 1736.16] but medical medium information in books
[1734.88 - 1737.76] actually reversed their condition and
[1736.16 - 1739.44] healed them you know
[1737.76 - 1741.68] yeah so there you go jennifer said oh my

[1785.28 - 1789.68] try to piss on medical medium as she's
[1787.52 - 1791.28] taken as she's taking the information
[1789.68 - 1793.12] that's what people do
[1791.28 - 1795.68] pressing prince good to see you right
[1793.12 - 1798.56] there uh pressing prince if skeptics
[1795.68 - 1799.44] just really sat back and listened to all
[1798.56 - 1800.96] your info
[1799.44 - 1803.12] i'm sure they would notice how much
[1800.96 - 1804.80] sense you really make you are amazing
[1803.12 - 1806.96] and you have so many people that love
[1804.80 - 1808.72] everything you share and have truly
[1806.96 - 1810.56] made a seal pressing prince thanks so
[1808.72 - 1814.00] much pretty cool
[1810.56 - 1816.72] amy mm healed me doctors did not
[1814.00 - 1817.52] i mean but you know what happens that
[1816.72 - 1819.52] person
[1817.52 - 1820.56] never got sick enough right so that's
[1819.52 - 1821.92] how it works you guys
[1820.56 - 1823.84] that's how it works they never got sick
[1821.92 - 1825.60] enough they haven't they probably just
[1823.84 - 1827.52] got a little sick
[1825.60 - 1829.36] and then they went to a couple of
[1827.52 - 1830.56] functional medicine doctors that gave
[1829.36 - 1832.16] them some tips
[1830.56 - 1833.60] and some things that were probably
[1832.16 - 1834.88] partly on them because functional
[1833.60 - 1836.48] medicine uses medical mean
[1834.88 - 1838.32] information now they never did before
[1836.48 - 1841.20] the publications of the books
[1838.32 - 1842.80] but they use it now right and so a lot
[1841.20 - 1844.08] of different practitioners and doctors
[1842.80 - 1846.24] they use mm info
[1844.08 - 1847.44] so they're probably just skating by okay
[1846.24 - 1849.60] they don't need to go too
[1847.44 - 1851.28] far through healing they don't have to
[1849.60 - 1853.84] really take it too seriously
[1851.28 - 1854.72] because they're not really that sick and
[1853.84 - 1856.24] but if they get
[1854.72 - 1858.24] really sick down the road they'll be
[1856.24 - 1858.80] back here you know spirit of compassion
[1858.24 - 1861.20] told me
[1858.80 - 1863.04] a long time ago when i was young that
[1861.20 - 1864.00] you know what even the skeptics still
[1863.04 - 1865.52] have to try to
[1864.00 - 1867.76] find the truth and the answers in the
[1865.52 - 1869.28] end if they get sick enough
[1867.76 - 1870.96] and they're stuck on mattress island
[1869.28 - 1872.08] then they have to just swallow their
[1870.96 - 1874.08] pride
[1872.08 - 1876.00] realize science totally screwed them
[1874.08 - 1878.40] over and didn't have the answers
[1876.00 - 1880.16] and then they have to find their way so
[1878.40 - 1881.76] yeah
[1880.16 - 1883.20] look anyway let's talk about this a
[1881.76 - 1885.36] little bit more you guys
[1883.20 - 1886.32] so your your immune system is in your
[1885.36 - 1888.08] blood oh
[1886.32 - 1890.56] so wait a minute that's interesting
[1888.08 - 1892.08] because um
[1890.56 - 1893.92] most of your immune system is in your
[1892.08 - 1895.92] blood but i guess you'll just
[1893.92 - 1897.28] go trust someone some other person
[1895.92 - 1898.40] because how can you trust me
[1897.28 - 1899.68] you'll trust some other person that
[1898.40 - 1901.52] doesn't know your immune system is in
[1899.68 - 1903.20] your blood that's interesting right
[1901.52 - 1904.80] this is unbelievable you'll trust
[1903.20 - 1906.56] somebody that doesn't even have a clue
[1904.80 - 1907.68] let's just draw lots of blood out of you
[1906.56 - 1910.88] every single month
[1907.68 - 1913.12] let's drain you dry and blood let you
[1910.88 - 1915.04] anyway the immune system's in your blood
[1913.12 - 1916.40] and there's a reason for that
[1915.04 - 1918.00] and it goes through all the different
[1916.40 - 1919.36] blood vessels to protect your heart so
[1918.00 - 1922.32] that's another thing too
[1919.36 - 1923.44] so that's your little heart right there
[1922.32 - 1927.28] okay
[1923.44 - 1928.24] and in those blood vessels and those
[1927.28 - 1930.96] tiny arteries
[1928.24 - 1931.76] blood vessels right you have your immune
[1930.96 - 1934.00] system
[1931.76 - 1935.36] it's critical that's what protects you
[1934.00 - 1937.84] from getting blood
[1935.36 - 1938.64] poisoning because that's why your immune
[1937.84 - 1943.44] system
[1938.64 - 1946.40] system is mostly in your blood to stop
[1943.44 - 1946.88] you from getting sepsis to stop you from
[1946.40 - 1949.12] getting
[1946.88 - 1950.72] blood poisoning that's the key that's
[1949.12 - 1952.08] another really important part right
[1950.72 - 1955.04] there so
[1952.08 - 1956.48] um another thing too blood going through
[1955.04 - 1958.56] your heart
[1956.48 - 1959.52] has to has to have a strong immune
[1958.56 - 1962.00] system
[1959.52 - 1964.32] so you don't get infected valves so you
[1962.00 - 1966.16] don't get infections to the heart
[1964.32 - 1967.76] so the reason why our immune system is
[1966.16 - 1970.08] in in our bloodstream
[1967.76 - 1971.52] ninety percent of it the most majority
[1970.08 - 1972.88] of our immune system is in our
[1971.52 - 1974.24] bloodstream is so you don't get an
[1972.88 - 1976.00] infection in your heart
[1974.24 - 1978.00] and you don't get an infection in your
[1976.00 - 1979.92] brain two places that you
[1978.00 - 1981.44] have to know that are so important right
[1979.92 - 1983.44] there okay and then
[1981.44 - 1984.64] the second most important place your
[1983.44 - 1987.12] immune system is
[1984.64 - 1988.00] after that is your liver so there you go
[1987.12 - 1990.96] see your liver
[1988.00 - 1992.48] that's the second most important spot as
[1990.96 - 1993.36] your liver and that's where the immune
[1992.48 - 1996.08] system is
[1993.36 - 1998.48] okay the second most important spot your
[1996.08 - 2000.16] immune system is all right
[1998.48 - 2002.80] third most important spot is your
[2000.16 - 2005.36] lymphatic system but that's a third
[2002.80 - 2006.88] okay second is your liver and i'll talk
[2005.36 - 2008.56] about the lymphatic system for a second
[2006.88 - 2010.16] to you guys your lymphatic system is
[2008.56 - 2012.72] only as good as your liver
[2010.16 - 2013.92] keep that in mind all right so and it's
[2012.72 - 2016.32] only a small amount
[2013.92 - 2017.84] of lymphocytes in your lymphatic system
[2016.32 - 2019.28] so that's not the majority of your
[2017.84 - 2022.56] immune system
[2019.28 - 2024.96] and but what happens is that the liver
[2022.56 - 2026.72] is has to stay healthy for your
[2024.96 - 2027.60] lymphatic system to be healthy so when
[2026.72 - 2029.04] everybody's trying to cleanse their
[2027.60 - 2029.76] lymphatic system what they're really
[2029.04 - 2031.52] doing
[2029.76 - 2033.12] by accident sometimes some of those
[2031.52 - 2035.60] different things they do
[2033.12 - 2037.04] is it's oh hey i want a juice hey i want
[2035.60 - 2038.88] to do some juicing now
[2037.04 - 2040.64] and try to cleanse my lymphatic system
[2038.88 - 2043.04] when they don't get it their juicing
[2040.64 - 2045.12] is helping to cleanse their liver and
[2043.04 - 2046.00] that's how you get a lymphatic system
[2045.12 - 2048.48] more healthy it
[2046.00 - 2050.40] has to be the liver because you can't
[2048.48 - 2051.68] just you can do all the lymphatic work
[2050.40 - 2052.48] you want you can get all the lymph
[2051.68 - 2053.84] massage
[2052.48 - 2055.44] you can get all the d you can do
[2053.84 - 2056.40] everything you can possibly do you can
[2055.44 - 2059.28] be a runner
[2056.40 - 2060.88] okay and you can like i love to run you
[2059.28 - 2063.60] can be like a runner
[2060.88 - 2064.56] and that's what you do you run 15 miles
[2063.60 - 2067.36] a day
[2064.56 - 2068.24] you're like okay just ran 15 20 miles
[2067.36 - 2070.16] i'm good
[2068.24 - 2072.32] i got my lymphatic system moving because
[2070.16 - 2075.12] i'm exercising but if your liver's
[2072.32 - 2076.56] dirty your lymphatic system never cleans
[2075.12 - 2078.16] up does it matter if you're a runner
[2076.56 - 2080.64] does it matter if you're an athlete
[2078.16 - 2081.28] doesn't matter if you work out every day
[2080.64 - 2084.00] if you don't
[2081.28 - 2085.12] keep the liver clean your lymphatic
[2084.00 - 2087.60] system can never
[2085.12 - 2089.92] clean it can never get cleaned up
[2087.60 - 2092.72] lymphatic system is the second blood
[2089.92 - 2095.36] filter in the blood lymph filter after
[2092.72 - 2097.28] the liver so the first one is the liver
[2095.36 - 2099.44] after that it's the lymphatic system so
[2097.28 - 2101.68] everybody's like oh my lymphatic system
[2099.44 - 2104.00] is the most important thing you know
[2101.68 - 2107.12] it's all lymph lymph actually no
[2104.00 - 2109.44] no it's not it's liver liver liver
[2107.12 - 2111.84] that's your filter when that filter gets
[2109.44 - 2113.52] dirty your lymphatic system
[2111.84 - 2115.52] is just trashed that's how it works you
[2113.52 - 2116.08] can't keep up with that lymphatic system
[2115.52 - 2118.00] ever
[2116.08 - 2119.60] unless the liver is addressed so that's
[2118.00 - 2121.28] important too so
[2119.60 - 2122.88] you can be doing like all the lymphatic
[2121.28 - 2123.68] stuff you want but when you're eating
[2122.88 - 2125.52] like too much
[2123.68 - 2127.12] like chicken and cookies because
[2125.52 - 2128.48] chicken's too high in fat
[2127.12 - 2130.00] when you're having your ice cream bars
[2128.48 - 2132.08] you're needing too many eggs you're
[2130.00 - 2134.48] having your eggs right
[2132.08 - 2136.16] when you're eating things that feed bugs
[2134.48 - 2138.80] and feed pathogens
[2136.16 - 2140.32] okay and they clog up the liver too and
[2138.80 - 2141.84] you get a lot of different exposures to
[2140.32 - 2143.60] the liver so you got like
[2141.84 - 2145.44] air fresheners you're breathing in goes
[2143.60 - 2146.64] right into the liver scented candles
[2145.44 - 2148.80] right into the liver
[2146.64 - 2151.20] right you know whatever it is you just
[2148.80 - 2153.04] absorbs right into the liver
[2151.20 - 2155.12] different chemicals different toxins
[2153.04 - 2157.28] cleaners all that difference of clones
[2155.12 - 2159.76] perfumes right goes right into the liver
[2157.28 - 2161.20] and so when you have that that perfume
[2159.76 - 2162.88] you're spraying that perfume the minute
[2161.20 - 2164.80] you breathe it in ends up in the liver
[2162.88 - 2166.08] first that's where it will end up
[2164.80 - 2167.92] you'll end up in your mouth you'll
[2166.08 - 2169.20] swallow it goes down into your digestive
[2167.92 - 2171.12] system then right up the
[2169.20 - 2172.32] paddock portal highway highway right
[2171.12 - 2175.12] into the liver
[2172.32 - 2176.72] and so what the critical thing to
[2175.12 - 2179.12] understand is
[2176.72 - 2179.76] is that there's all the lymphatic hubbub
[2179.12 - 2181.20] because
[2179.76 - 2183.36] everybody's trying to sell some kind of
[2181.20 - 2185.76] lymphatic thing too so it's like gut
[2183.36 - 2186.88] lymphatic gut guts everything immune
[2185.76 - 2189.20] systems in your gut
[2186.88 - 2190.80] lymphatic immune system is not in your
[2189.20 - 2193.04] gut you can be 85 years old
[2190.80 - 2194.56] you know anybody that's like 85 or 80 i
[2193.04 - 2196.64] know people do you know anybody that's
[2194.56 - 2197.44] 90 and they just eat whatever i know
[2196.64 - 2199.92] people
[2197.44 - 2201.52] have eaten whatever they want pizza ice
[2199.92 - 2203.84] cream every day
[2201.52 - 2204.56] anything they want right they just eat
[2203.84 - 2205.84] it
[2204.56 - 2207.84] and they're eating it every day and
[2205.84 - 2209.76] they're 80 years old and their gut's a
[2207.84 - 2212.32] mess i know people that eat chocolate
[2209.76 - 2214.88] cake every day with lard

[2218.72 - 2222.24] gut is
[2219.68 - 2223.60] trash their gut is filled with every bad
[2222.24 - 2226.64] microorganism that's
[2223.60 - 2228.08] feeding off of all that crap and garbage
[2226.64 - 2230.40] and the alcohol and everything
[2228.08 - 2231.36] right you guys and then and then but

[2254.32 - 2257.60] and they're filling themselves up all
[2255.76 - 2259.44] with all this garbage and junk

[2274.96 - 2278.88] and they had to lay in bed and they had
[2277.12 - 2280.00] to see 20 doctors and specialists and
[2278.88 - 2280.72] then what happened they were blood
[2280.00 - 2282.80] leaded
[2280.72 - 2284.24] then they were bloodletted okay well
[2282.80 - 2284.80] honey you've got to go see this new
[2284.24 - 2287.52] doctor

[2288.16 - 2292.96] 16 tubes right right and they're then
[2290.96 - 2294.72] they put them on this no sugar diet they
[2292.96 - 2296.64] put them on these somewhat healthy diets
[2294.72 - 2300.16] to get rid of processed foods
[2296.64 - 2301.12] but this 55 year old right is playing
[2300.16 - 2303.12] tennis
[2301.12 - 2305.20] chucking down chocolate cake doing
[2303.12 - 2308.56] tequila shots at night
[2305.20 - 2310.08] with her his friends guts a mess filled
[2308.56 - 2312.00] with all kinds of crap you think there's
[2310.08 - 2315.04] good microorganisms in that gut of that
[2312.00 - 2316.64] person no what it is is they don't
[2315.04 - 2319.84] happen to have a virus
[2316.64 - 2323.04] or a pathogen or the right kind of strap
[2319.84 - 2325.52] or hhv-6 hhv-7 simplexes
[2323.04 - 2327.20] or they don't have enough viruses
[2325.52 - 2330.56] shingles ebv
[2327.20 - 2332.40] wreaking enough havoc yet in their life
[2330.56 - 2334.64] and a 22 year old can be loaded with
[2332.40 - 2335.68] epstein barr and it's totally taking her
[2334.64 - 2338.16] him down
[2335.68 - 2340.24] boom down and they could be on a clean
[2338.16 - 2340.72] diet unless they know what to do unless
[2340.24 - 2342.32] they know
[2340.72 - 2344.08] how to clean it up unless they know how
[2342.32 - 2346.48] to take care of themselves and
[2344.08 - 2347.36] and and know what protocols to use you
[2346.48 - 2349.68] know
[2347.36 - 2350.40] and know how it works mm is just not
[2349.68 - 2352.32] about
[2350.40 - 2353.44] some celery juice it's not just about
[2352.32 - 2355.68] food it's about
[2353.44 - 2357.60] important protocols you know it's about
[2355.68 - 2359.52] the right kind of vitamin c that's the
[2357.60 - 2362.72] micro see right there that i use
[2359.52 - 2363.44] not sponsored it's about having details
[2362.72 - 2365.68] and knowing
[2363.44 - 2367.76] how to use things you know and that's
[2365.68 - 2369.60] important we can play gut health games
[2367.76 - 2371.12] all we want but if we don't have the
[2369.60 - 2373.12] right stuff
[2371.12 - 2375.04] you know and then we get in trouble and
[2373.12 - 2377.04] that that's what happens you know like
[2375.04 - 2378.16] here's the cat's claw that's the vimergy
[2377.04 - 2380.80] cat's claw right there
[2378.16 - 2382.96] that that i love love the vimergy cats
[2380.80 - 2384.96] club because for lyme disease
[2382.96 - 2387.68] that's what i taught doctors that use
[2384.96 - 2389.84] for the last 35 years it's cat's claw
[2387.68 - 2391.84] and there wasn't a product like this out
[2389.84 - 2392.24] at the time just wasn't a product like
[2391.84 - 2394.56] this
[2392.24 - 2397.92] good out there would have to get the
[2394.56 - 2399.60] dried cat's claw i remember 25 years ago
[2397.92 - 2401.84] i'd have the dried cat's call in my
[2399.60 - 2403.36] office and doctors would be calling me
[2401.84 - 2405.28] up be like for my patients do you have
[2403.36 - 2406.64] any more of that dried cat's claw
[2405.28 - 2408.32] tea do you have any more of that i'll be
[2406.64 - 2408.96] like send it out to you i'll get it out
[2408.32 - 2410.40] to you
[2408.96 - 2412.48] and it's like but we didn't have
[2410.40 - 2413.44] anything like this you know like the
[2412.48 - 2416.40] vimergy
[2413.44 - 2418.24] um it's important to know so that's
[2416.40 - 2419.28] critical right there are the b12 energy
[2418.24 - 2423.28] b12
[2419.28 - 2424.08] so gut health is this blanket term right
[2423.28 - 2427.04] now to sell
[2424.08 - 2427.52] to sell products and then to lie to
[2427.04 - 2429.12] people
[2427.52 - 2431.04] you know it's like your immune system is
[2429.12 - 2433.36] all in your gut it's a theory
[2431.04 - 2434.56] it's not actual truth there's no truth
[2433.36 - 2435.76] they haven't figured it out
[2434.56 - 2438.16] scientifically
[2435.76 - 2439.60] it's made up but it's made up for the
[2438.16 - 2441.84] gut health companies you know
[2439.60 - 2443.44] and meanwhile you can go on like the
[2441.84 - 2444.24] merry-go-round and you're looking for
[2443.44 - 2445.76] help and you're
[2444.24 - 2448.40] you're at the next doctor and he's got
[2445.76 - 2450.96] you off the wrong foods
[2448.40 - 2452.32] he's got you you know doing different
[2450.96 - 2453.52] things he's got you on gut health
[2452.32 - 2454.88] products you might improve because he
[2453.52 - 2456.48] gets you off of some gluten
[2454.88 - 2458.08] and some dairy products or some
[2456.48 - 2461.52] processed food
[2458.08 - 2462.88] but then you know then you know you get
[2461.52 - 2465.28] a little better because you're not
[2462.88 - 2466.08] feet you're not feeding too many
[2465.28 - 2468.00] pathogens
[2466.08 - 2469.20] maybe the doctor gets you off of gluten
[2468.00 - 2470.48] so now you're not
[2469.20 - 2471.84] you're not you eat some gluten right
[2470.48 - 2473.84] you're not eating gluten and you're not
[2471.84 - 2475.36] feeding the bugs inside your gut
[2473.84 - 2476.96] right you're not feeding the bugs inside
[2475.36 - 2478.08] your body okay
[2476.96 - 2480.24] that's another thing too you're not
[2478.08 - 2481.68] feeding your shred for viruses jennifer
[2480.24 - 2485.04] says now 50
[2481.68 - 2487.60] had to eat better than everyone since 14
[2485.04 - 2488.96] then how to drop out third semester in
[2487.60 - 2492.08] college
[2488.96 - 2495.44] did some shots during during
[2492.08 - 2497.76] just to ease the mental pain finally two
[2495.44 - 2500.40] years ago began to heal with you
[2497.76 - 2502.32] you know you know that's amazing and
[2500.40 - 2504.64] look i've been saying this for years
[2502.32 - 2506.00] no one talks about all of the college
[2504.64 - 2508.32] students
[2506.00 - 2509.52] that never finish college nobody talks
[2508.32 - 2512.32] about them
[2509.52 - 2513.44] margaret valentine glad you're here no
[2512.32 - 2516.64] one no one
[2513.44 - 2519.44] no one talks about them thousands upon
[2516.64 - 2520.40] thousands i remember when i used to see
[2519.44 - 2521.76] people right
[2520.40 - 2523.68] and doctors would send all their
[2521.76 - 2527.84] patients to me and and
[2523.68 - 2531.04] um needing help there were
[2527.84 - 2532.96] just droves of college students
[2531.04 - 2534.24] that never finished college not because
[2532.96 - 2535.60] they didn't want to
[2534.24 - 2537.84] they couldn't go out with their friends
[2535.60 - 2539.28] anymore and drink they couldn't get
[2537.84 - 2542.96] their studies done
[2539.28 - 2544.80] they were all home in bed and
[2542.96 - 2546.88] that's what it was it's still like that
[2544.80 - 2548.96] now more than ever before
[2546.88 - 2550.56] nobody talks about it right but someone
[2548.96 - 2551.52] would come on here like a naysayer like
[2550.56 - 2553.04] a hater like
[2551.52 - 2554.80] when i just read that comment earlier
[2553.04 - 2555.36] earlier and they'd be like don't listen
[2554.80 - 2558.32] to him
[2555.36 - 2560.40] listen to a doctor he's not a doctor
[2558.32 - 2561.60] he's not a whatever never said it was a
[2560.40 - 2564.24] doctor
[2561.60 - 2564.64] and you know and and it's amazing though
[2564.24 - 2567.28] right
[2564.64 - 2568.16] that's somebody that doesn't know that
[2567.28 - 2570.00] hundreds of
[2568.16 - 2571.92] hundreds of thousands of college
[2570.00 - 2574.24] students never finished college
[2571.92 - 2576.40] and they saw every doctor under the sun
[2574.24 - 2577.92] at 22 years old 20 years old 18 years
[2576.40 - 2579.60] old 19 year old that's somebody that's
[2577.92 - 2581.60] so disconnected
[2579.60 - 2582.88] to what's really happening in the world
[2581.60 - 2584.64] of chronic illness and people's
[2582.88 - 2587.12] struggles in people's trials somebody's
[2584.64 - 2590.00] so disconnected to say that
[2587.12 - 2591.36] it's like it's just kind of funny when
[2590.00 - 2592.24] you think about how disconnected they
[2591.36 - 2594.48] are
[2592.24 - 2595.84] christie my dad has been using cat's

[2720.88 - 2724.72] it's sick and this is part of how the
[2723.04 - 2727.28] system's totally broken
[2724.72 - 2729.52] so broken um jill says how much cat's
[2727.28 - 2729.92] claw should we take i got dosages in the
[2729.52 - 2731.60] book
[2729.92 - 2733.36] ask your doctor take it to your book
[2731.60 - 2736.00] that's your doctor um
[2733.36 - 2737.04] what do i do it's another story like me
[2736.00 - 2739.12] personally
[2737.04 - 2740.08] i don't have anything to worry about i'm
[2739.12 - 2742.48] not sick
[2740.08 - 2743.12] but i take it because i can you know
[2742.48 - 2745.92] it's like
[2743.12 - 2746.40] when you know when you know too much
[2745.92 - 2748.64] about
[2746.40 - 2750.24] what's going on you know too much about
[2748.64 - 2751.84] everything i mean i might end up in a
[2750.24 - 2753.76] public bathroom somewhere
[2751.84 - 2755.44] right where it's like you just you're
[2753.76 - 2757.12] just stuck out and you're
[2755.44 - 2758.64] out somewhere and you're with some
[2757.12 - 2759.44] friends or some family and you're like
[2758.64 - 2761.84] well
[2759.44 - 2763.04] nature calls man you know now you're in
[2761.84 - 2765.20] a public bathroom
[2763.04 - 2766.32] anyway so i just take you know i i
[2765.20 - 2768.24] always take these things but
[2766.32 - 2769.60] what i do is i take two dropper fulls of
[2768.24 - 2771.20] cats call a day personally
[2769.60 - 2772.64] i that's what i take every day i just
[2771.20 - 2774.24] take two two dropper fulls
[2772.64 - 2776.80] sometimes i'll take a break for a little
[2774.24 - 2780.24] while um
[2776.80 - 2781.28] april says cat's claw makes my joints
[2780.24 - 2784.48] hurt
[2781.28 - 2785.92] um well did you ever have joint pain
[2784.48 - 2789.92] before or that's the
[2785.92 - 2792.32] only time so no joint pain no body pain
[2789.92 - 2794.08] joints never hurt at all ever i just
[2792.32 - 2795.52] want you to be your own detective right
[2794.08 - 2797.36] so i'm just that's why i'm just
[2795.52 - 2799.76] mentioning this right um
[2797.36 - 2801.28] so nothing ever hurt before and then you
[2799.76 - 2802.00] took the cat's claw and all sent your
[2801.28 - 2803.60] joints hurt
[2802.00 - 2804.80] or do your joints hurt periodically
[2803.60 - 2806.48] because you already have a problem and
[2804.80 - 2807.76] that's why you're taking cat's claw or
[2806.48 - 2809.52] trying to find the next
[2807.76 - 2811.12] new thing to help you heal and all that
[2809.52 - 2811.92] just really important question right
[2811.12 - 2814.24] there
[2811.92 - 2815.12] the other thing is did it have alcohol
[2814.24 - 2817.52] in it
[2815.12 - 2819.12] was it a bad brand what did it have
[2817.52 - 2820.80] citric acid in it did it have
[2819.12 - 2822.80] additives in it there's a ton of bad
[2820.80 - 2825.28] ones a ton of terrible ones
[2822.80 - 2827.04] if it is a good one right if it is a
[2825.28 - 2829.44] good one
[2827.04 - 2830.96] it also kills bugs so if you're somebody
[2829.44 - 2832.32] already with jim joint pain and with
[2830.96 - 2833.92] some issues and what fatigue and all
[2832.32 - 2836.80] these other things and you take the
[2833.92 - 2838.40] good one what i would do if it was me
[2836.80 - 2839.60] ask your doctor what he wants to do and
[2838.40 - 2841.84] listen to him
[2839.60 - 2843.20] but if it was me you know i would do
[2841.84 - 2846.24] smaller dosage
[2843.20 - 2848.32] personally smaller dosage and
[2846.24 - 2850.16] that's what i would do of the best one
[2848.32 - 2852.48] there is and that's what i would do
[2850.16 - 2854.24] but ask your doctor what's great for you
[2852.48 - 2856.00] um
[2854.24 - 2857.60] so yeah so anyway you guys give you a

[2991.12 - 2995.44] it's just i know that a lot of dudes a
[2993.20 - 2996.80] lot of naturopaths that reach out to me
[2995.44 - 2999.28] a lot of different doctors that reach
[2996.80 - 3000.80] out to me they they'll even say many of
[2999.28 - 3002.88] them like look i've been in a bubble i
[3000.80 - 3004.32] see my patients all day long but i don't
[3002.88 - 3006.40] know what happened out there in the
[3004.32 - 3007.76] world i don't know what's going on and
[3006.40 - 3009.84] i don't know what to trust on the
[3007.76 - 3011.68] internet and i'm too busy in my own
[3009.84 - 3012.16] practice to know what's going on out
[3011.68 - 3014.48] there
[3012.16 - 3015.68] and they miss they miss the boat ride
[3014.48 - 3017.52] for their patients
[3015.68 - 3019.28] so they'll say to a patient hey cat's
[3017.52 - 3022.16] claws are all bad out there
[3019.28 - 3023.44] don't get any cat's claw and but they
[3022.16 - 3025.04] don't even know what the cat's claw has
[3023.44 - 3026.32] done for people or what the hell
[3025.04 - 3027.92] people have been through and how it's
[3026.32 - 3029.12] reversed neurological conditions for
[3027.92 - 3031.12] people and
[3029.12 - 3032.16] i don't blame the dude at all or
[3031.12 - 3034.00] anything
[3032.16 - 3035.60] and i just know that so many guys they
[3034.00 - 3037.20] live in a bubble and i totally get it
[3035.60 - 3038.24] but listen to your doctor if he says
[3037.20 - 3040.48] don't do cat's claw
[3038.24 - 3042.08] don't do it okay listen to your doctor
[3040.48 - 3045.20] and don't do the cat's claw
