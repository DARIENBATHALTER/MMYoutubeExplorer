[0.40 - 3.12] we're live anthony william the medical
[2.16 - 6.16] medium
[3.12 - 8.24] did you catch the mold episode mold
[6.16 - 9.60] you got to check it out um looking
[8.24 - 12.08] forward to you guys checking this
[9.60 - 13.84] episode out mold the crazy maker it's
[12.08 - 14.96] the reason why i call it that because it
[13.84 - 16.64] has really
[14.96 - 18.48] caused a lot of trouble with a lot of
[16.64 - 19.28] people and it could make us go crazy in
[18.48 - 21.28] such a
[19.28 - 23.12] in such an intense way i've actually
[21.28 - 24.40] talked to a friend recently had intense
[23.12 - 27.76] mold exposure
[24.40 - 30.24] and it really triggered everything
[27.76 - 31.76] in this friend as far as fatigue and
[30.24 - 35.04] aches and pains
[31.76 - 37.36] and just oh my god the brain fog that
[35.04 - 38.96] my friend deal has dealt with with it
[37.36 - 41.68] has just been off the charts so
[38.96 - 43.12] i i kind of think that the mold issues
[41.68 - 44.80] that we deal today
[43.12 - 46.16] should get more attention it's like
[44.80 - 46.64] everybody kind of sweeps it under the
[46.16 - 48.64] carpet
[46.64 - 50.00] nobody really wants to know about it
[48.64 - 51.52] unless you're living with it and then if
[50.00 - 52.32] you're living with it nobody else really
[51.52 - 53.92] cares
[52.32 - 55.28] there's really like not a lot of help
[53.92 - 56.64] for people out there when you're dealing
[55.28 - 58.16] with mold exposure
[56.64 - 59.68] people go through hell and back with

[268.08 - 272.72] it they're like oh that's so
[269.60 - 274.40] sad really mold how what does that mean
[272.72 - 276.40] is it really bad and
[274.40 - 278.88] it's you know a lot of people don't get
[276.40 - 280.48] support now i've had friends
[278.88 - 282.80] that have had mold you know mold
[280.48 - 284.56] problems devastate their lives and hit
[282.80 - 286.08] them really hard you guys
[284.56 - 287.68] and then they tell their other friends
[286.08 - 290.48] and other friends like really
[287.68 - 290.96] uh what does that mean mold um you mean
[290.48 - 293.60] like
[290.96 - 295.60] something got moldy and they're like no
[293.60 - 297.52] it's devastating a pipe broke in the
[295.60 - 299.12] house the basement mold came up
[297.52 - 300.72] there's mold all over the house there's
[299.12 - 302.64] molding around the apartment
[300.72 - 304.08] and they kind of don't get it and they
[302.64 - 306.08] don't get what that means so what does
[304.08 - 307.44] that mean you got to move out
[306.08 - 309.68] does that mean you have to find a new
[307.44 - 311.60] place to live like what does that mean
[309.68 - 313.52] and so the support for mold all on its
[311.60 - 314.96] own and that's not even getting sick
[313.52 - 316.64] and then when you get sick where you're
[314.96 - 318.56] like yeah mold
[316.64 - 320.72] made me sick and then friends are like
[318.56 - 321.76] well did mold really make you sick i've
[320.72 - 325.36] seen it where friends
[321.76 - 326.88] question friends you know even family
[325.36 - 328.48] members question family members but
[326.88 - 329.20] friends question friends i've seen that
[328.48 - 332.08] out there
[329.20 - 332.48] seen doctors question patients and say
[332.08 - 334.56] uh
[332.48 - 336.08] this isn't from mold this isn't mold
[334.56 - 338.24] didn't kind of cause this
[336.08 - 339.68] this isn't probably a mold issue so i've
[338.24 - 341.20] seen that over the years too now there's
[339.68 - 341.68] more doctors that actually believe in
[341.20 - 343.68] mold
[341.68 - 345.76] that's good but as i talk about in the
[343.68 - 346.88] episode they still don't know why
[345.76 - 348.80] someone really
[346.88 - 350.48] gets triggered in a way they do buy mold
[348.80 - 353.12] and what's going on deep inside of them
[350.48 - 353.12] you know
[353.52 - 357.04] while wireless says hi anthony the mold
[355.20 - 360.00] podcast is great great
[357.04 - 361.84] um great you take the fear out of mold
[360.00 - 364.40] we can overcome it you can
[361.84 - 366.48] it's important to actually have the
[364.40 - 367.76] ability to be empowered and have that
[366.48 - 370.56] information
[367.76 - 372.24] um messaging with angels good to see you
[370.56 - 374.40] catching up on the podcast the egg
[372.24 - 377.52] podcast is amazing oh my god
[374.40 - 379.12] the egg podcast is one of my favorites
[377.52 - 380.56] messaging with angels it's one of my
[379.12 - 382.96] favorites and
[380.56 - 384.88] it's really intense really tons of truth
[382.96 - 386.00] in there tons of information in there
[384.88 - 388.16] check these out at medical medium
[386.00 - 390.48] podcasts at apple podcast if you haven't
[388.16 - 392.08] heard these the mold one is what i'm
[390.48 - 393.68] talking about today i might cover
[392.08 - 394.16] neurological symptoms in a little bit
[393.68 - 395.84] too
[394.16 - 397.92] we're live right now if you guys just
[395.84 - 400.40] came on um
[397.92 - 401.28] totally live that's right it's the way
[400.40 - 404.88] to do it
[401.28 - 405.84] and so the mold today is not the same
[404.88 - 409.04] mold as
[405.84 - 410.72] yesterday the the mold in the years here
[409.04 - 413.12] aren't the same as yesteryear
[410.72 - 415.60] important to know the reason why is we
[413.12 - 418.56] have thousands of super molds now
[415.60 - 420.56] and they've gotten really strong because
[418.56 - 421.44] fungicides are everywhere fungicides are
[420.56 - 423.12] created by
[421.44 - 425.52] you know the chemical giants they make
[423.12 - 428.08] fungicides to try to kill the mold
[425.52 - 430.32] and when they do that they make mold
[428.08 - 432.56] stronger and then make a new mold and
[430.32 - 434.00] mold adapts the minute you try to
[432.56 - 436.72] exterminate it
[434.00 - 438.48] with a fungicide it just adapts and it
[436.72 - 439.84] gets stronger and that's what happens
[438.48 - 442.16] and i talk about how
[439.84 - 443.28] fungicide is sprayed on the highways
[442.16 - 445.60] every single
[443.28 - 446.80] highway at least in the u.s and probably
[445.60 - 448.80] globally too
[446.80 - 450.80] and i've heard it's in in other places
[448.80 - 452.24] around the world they spray the sides of
[450.80 - 453.52] every highway it's sprayed with
[452.24 - 457.04] fungicides
[453.52 - 459.28] um you know rest stops on highways
[457.04 - 461.04] are sprayed with fungicides in inside
[459.28 - 461.92] the rest stops it's just fungicides
[461.04 - 464.00] everywhere
[461.92 - 465.52] and it's always like this and new
[464.00 - 466.16] clothes when you buy new clothes brand
[465.52 - 468.32] new clothes
[466.16 - 469.60] sprayed with fungicides got to wash them
[468.32 - 470.96] and everything so
[469.60 - 472.56] you know and people don't realize that
[470.96 - 473.92] they try on new clothes all the
[472.56 - 475.60] fungicides in there
[473.92 - 477.92] and they get the air fresheners sent to
[475.60 - 479.76] candles those got fungicides in them
[477.92 - 481.52] clones and perfumes have
[479.76 - 482.88] fungicides in them i talk about it in
[481.52 - 486.32] the episode you guys
[482.88 - 489.52] about how you can have an old bottle of
[486.32 - 492.08] of cologne that's 50 years old
[489.52 - 493.36] and there's no jellyfish in the middle
[492.08 - 496.32] of it how come
[493.36 - 496.96] there's a fungicide in it to stop from
[496.32 - 499.20] from a fun
[496.96 - 500.80] fungus forming in your bottle of clone
[499.20 - 504.00] it's unbelievable really

[544.64 - 550.64] there's healing tools in this podcast so
[547.44 - 552.24] the mold one is the one up now
[550.64 - 554.32] that's what's going on here the link is
[552.24 - 555.84] in the description so please know that
[554.32 - 557.28] the link is in the description so you're
[555.84 - 559.20] going to want to check these out
[557.28 - 561.76] mold exposure is really serious it can
[559.20 - 564.88] trigger off a lot of symptoms in people
[561.76 - 566.64] it's a major trigger for illness and
[564.88 - 569.84] that's what it does you know
[566.64 - 571.44] uh gina says high anthony mold exposure
[569.84 - 573.20] symptoms sound similar to my lyme
[571.44 - 575.20] disease symptoms yes
[573.20 - 577.44] they do that because lyme disease
[575.20 - 581.04] symptoms are neurological
[577.44 - 583.28] mold exposure can trigger any
[581.04 - 584.80] okay just say you never had a diagnosis
[583.28 - 586.88] of lyme disease say you never had a
[584.80 - 587.68] diagnosis of some disease or illness or
[586.88 - 589.68] symptoms
[587.68 - 590.72] and what happens is when you get mold
[589.68 - 592.88] exposure it can
[590.72 - 594.64] trigger something inside of you and then
[592.88 - 596.32] you can end up with a lyme disease
[594.64 - 598.24] diagnosis for a lot of people that
[596.32 - 600.48] happens too so it's not like
[598.24 - 602.00] it's not like they they get lyme
[600.48 - 602.72] symptoms they get diagnosed with the
[602.00 - 605.52] lyme
[602.72 - 606.80] you know diagnoses and never see mold
[605.52 - 608.48] there's people out there that
[606.80 - 610.16] get the mold first it becomes the
[608.48 - 611.84] trigger and then they have the lyme
[610.16 - 612.64] symptoms then they have the neurological
[611.84 - 616.08] symptoms
[612.64 - 618.32] absolutely so that's how it works um
[616.08 - 620.96] so kelly says i'm new to this where do i
[618.32 - 623.76] find the apple podcast so medical medium

[700.32 - 704.96] yeah it's about making sure you guys
[703.20 - 706.72] have that knowledge so let's talk about
[704.96 - 709.84] mold for a little bit
[706.72 - 712.48] it's important um i talk about how
[709.84 - 714.80] fungicides are dropped everywhere
[712.48 - 716.96] they're even dropped out of helicopters
[714.80 - 717.84] they're dropped all over the place
[716.96 - 720.24] they're they're
[717.84 - 721.60] literally they're dropping fungicides on
[720.24 - 725.36] us like yearly they
[721.60 - 728.72] did side the highways parking lots
[725.36 - 731.44] schools yeah schools they just
[728.72 - 734.00] they just just they they they coat
[731.44 - 736.32] playgrounds with fungicide in schools
[734.00 - 738.08] and this is what they do and it's to
[736.32 - 739.36] stop mold from growing
[738.08 - 741.52] the chemical companies sell it to
[739.36 - 742.88] everybody as a package deal
[741.52 - 744.40] and then you just you just spray it
[742.88 - 746.16] everywhere so everybody's spraying it
[744.40 - 748.40] everywhere that's how it works
[746.16 - 750.16] um all the institutions spraying it
[748.40 - 752.00] everywhere this is how it's done
[750.16 - 753.44] hospitals they spray it everywhere
[752.00 - 755.20] fungicides everywhere
[753.44 - 757.36] and then it creates super molds over
[755.20 - 758.08] time molds that get a little crazy that
[757.36 - 760.40] get
[758.08 - 762.40] out of control and that's what we're up
[760.40 - 765.20] against out there so information
[762.40 - 766.16] very important information but i want to
[765.20 - 769.76] talk about this
[766.16 - 770.56] what mold does is mold lowers the immune
[769.76 - 772.88] system
[770.56 - 774.08] that's what it does mold lowers the
[772.88 - 777.68] immune system
[774.08 - 780.64] so that when it lowers the immune system
[777.68 - 782.48] it triggers something inside of us
[780.64 - 782.88] something that's already happening in
[782.48 - 784.80] there
[782.88 - 786.96] and that's why you can have a family of
[784.80 - 788.16] five you can have a family of seven you
[786.96 - 791.60] could have a family of three
[788.16 - 795.04] a family of four and only one person
[791.60 - 797.76] gets sick uh one person gets sick
[795.04 - 798.56] and that's it so it's like well why is
[797.76 - 802.40] mom sick
[798.56 - 803.52] why is mom in bed suffering with fatigue
[802.40 - 806.72] aches and pains
[803.52 - 807.04] tingles and numbness ticks and spasms or
[806.72 - 810.40] just
[807.04 - 812.16] body pain and why is mom suffering like
[810.40 - 814.48] that from mold exposure
[812.16 - 816.16] and dad's not you know dad can eat the
[814.48 - 818.00] mold it could be in the air
[816.16 - 819.92] it could be do living in it all
[818.00 - 821.68] breathing in it the kids are fine doing
[819.92 - 822.48] the same thing and that that's how it
[821.68 - 824.48] works

[954.32 - 957.44] mean podcast at apple podcast link is in
[956.16 - 959.12] the description
[957.44 - 961.12] and this week you can find it there
[959.12 - 963.68] medical mean podcast at apple podcast
[961.12 - 964.56] you know so catherine elizabeth good to
[963.68 - 966.48] see you
[964.56 - 968.40] hi anthony thank you for this episode
[966.48 - 971.12] blown away super molds
[968.40 - 972.56] scary that mold loves emf let's talk
[971.12 - 974.40] about that for a little bit
[972.56 - 975.76] so i can only scratch the surface you
[974.40 - 978.48] guys of what
[975.76 - 979.20] is in there but let's talk about the the
[978.48 - 982.80] emf
[979.20 - 984.48] and all that so molds they jive on a
[982.80 - 986.80] frequency is what they do
[984.48 - 988.24] they thrive on a frequency that's what
[986.80 - 990.32] molds like to do so
[988.24 - 991.36] and there's a reason for this because
[990.32 - 994.64] molds
[991.36 - 996.40] were tested in labs where there were
[994.64 - 999.52] tremendous amounts of
[996.40 - 1002.48] frequency electricity emf
[999.52 - 1004.00] radio signals all of it so mold has
[1002.48 - 1007.52] adapted to that it
[1004.00 - 1008.96] it loves cell towers so mold loves
[1007.52 - 1010.80] cell towers that doesn't mean throw away
[1008.96 - 1012.56] your devices because that doesn't matter
[1010.80 - 1014.00] cell tower is still sending signals
[1012.56 - 1014.80] regardless if you have a device in your
[1014.00 - 1016.64] hand or not
[1014.80 - 1018.48] still a signal that's going everywhere
[1016.64 - 1020.88] and molds love
[1018.48 - 1021.92] these types of frequencies they love it
[1020.88 - 1023.44] they love emf
[1021.92 - 1025.52] they love radio frequencies they love
[1023.44 - 1029.36] cell tower frequencies they love it all
[1025.52 - 1031.92] so with that mold thrives on that so
[1029.36 - 1033.60] when you break that frequency you got a
[1031.92 - 1035.04] chance of actually breaking mold and i
[1033.60 - 1038.48] talked about that in the episode
[1035.04 - 1040.32] so important nina says what's the book
[1038.48 - 1042.08] called the book right there
[1040.32 - 1043.76] that the book is cleanse the heel so
[1042.08 - 1047.44] medical medium cleanse the heel
