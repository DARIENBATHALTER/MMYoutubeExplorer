1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:05,120
I had sibo and gastritis after my mom

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,200
passed away 10 years ago after seeing

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:10,160
every doctor every nutritionist every GI

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,480
doctor and even getting fired from a few

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,599
doctors because they didn't know how to

6
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:15,799
help me they were all directing me into

7
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,640
the wrong path and steering me away from

8
00:00:15,799 --> 00:00:19,880
fruits and vegetables and it wasn't

9
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,080
until my kidney started shutting down I

10
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:24,359
finally picked up the book and did

11
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,039
everything exactly how he said after

12
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:28,080
about a year everything just started

13
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:30,240
turning around got my life back and I

14
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,759
was able to eat Whole Foods and fruits

15
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:36,280
and vegetables curing my sibo and my

16
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:38,559
anxiety and my insomnia and my gastritis

17
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:41,960
and it's just you know been such a

18
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:44,600
struggle for 9 10 years up until that

19
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:46,680
point I am just so thankful for Anthony

20
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:49,280
Williams because I wouldn't be standing

21
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,320
here living the life with my two

22
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,719
children and my family if it wasn't for

23
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,719
Anthony Williams

24
