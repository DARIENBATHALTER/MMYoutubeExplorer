but I want to talk about alcohol for a

26
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:52,680
couple of minutes and by the way day one

27
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,780

29
00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:00,059
so I'm in the alcohol chapter right here

30
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,079
in the brain saber book as you guys can

31
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:03,719
see

32
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:05,580
and I know people are drinking they're

33
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:08,220
drinking during the holidays I'm not

34
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:09,840
judging anybody okay if they want to

00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:13,200
drink they can drink that's perfectly

36
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,600

yeah I know total down all right anyway

46
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,140
brain saver I'm gonna read a little bit

47
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,600
out of here then we're gonna make some

48
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:42,180
drinks three drinks I'm pumped up I'm

49
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,659
glad you guys are here I'm excited

50
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:47,400
let's do it so alcohol right throughout

51
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:49,799
the centuries all the way up through

52
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,479
today we have Associated someone who's

53
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:52,740
had too much to drink with slurred

54
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:58,259
speech

55
00:01:52,740 --> 00:02:00,600
I had a lot to drink wood speech right

56
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:02,759
the inability to walk in a straight line

57
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,759
the inability to think or speak clearly

58
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:07,439
we call it being drunk

59
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,660
anyway you guys I'm into brain saver

60
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:12,120
books I'm on page 158 if you want to

61
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:13,400
read along so got the brain saver book

62
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,379
right there

63
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:18,660
158 the alcohol check have you read the

64
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:20,520
alcohol chapter it's sick it's insane

65
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:23,879
the information is just mind-blowing

66
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:25,860
about what alcohol does to the brain so

67
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:28,260
let's get into it a little bit

68
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:30,360
we call it being drunk if it becomes

69
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:33,239
more severe and that person is vomiting

70
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:35,400
or anything right incapacitated we may

71
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:37,140
call it alcohol poisoning you've heard

72
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,540
that right well that person has alcohol

73
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:41,099
poisoning yeah that person drank too

74
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,480
much they're they're holding on to the

75
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:45,000
toilet and they're throwing up and

76
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,379
they're vomiting all night long that

77
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,940
person has alcohol poison that person

78
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:49,440
was hospitalized because of alcohol

79
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:52,980
poisoning right

80
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,959
so that's that's what we call it and

81
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:57,660
that's how it works we may call it

82
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:00,300
alcohol poisoning do we really know what

83
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:04,620
happens when our bloodstream is

84
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:07,680
saturated with a high volume of alcohol

85
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:08,760
do we really know what's happening we

86
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,060
don't

87
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:13,379
and we never did

88
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:15,360
mind-blowing information I'm about to go

89
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:17,879
into I'm in the alcohol chapter right

90
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,200
now out of brain saver you just if you

91
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:21,060
just landed here where day one of the

92
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,760
medical meeting wild blueberry drinks

93
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:25,680
challenge we're making three drinks

94
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,140
without alcohol which is really cool

95
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,840
we're making a brain detox tonic which

96
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:32,519
doesn't have alcohol in it duh we're

97
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,739
making the wild blueberry apple cider

98
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:37,260
we're making the wild blueberry sangria

99
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:40,140
which I'm really excited about

100
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:42,540
we assumed because medical research and

101
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:44,640
science assume

102
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:47,099
that more alcohol in the bloodstream

103
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,360
leads directly to these actions and

104
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:51,599
symptoms

105
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:54,060
that alcohol itself affects the brain to

106
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,680
cause these experiences

107
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:58,440
here's the truth

108
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:01,019
no one knows exactly what happens inside

109
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:04,440
the brain with alcohol

110
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:06,780
that is the truth they don't know

111
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:08,879
medical science and research does not

112
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:10,200
know what happens when someone's

113
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:13,500
drinking

114
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:15,360
and alcohol enters the body they do not

115
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,220
know what happens to the brain they

116
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,079
don't have a tool to figure it out they

117
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:20,940
don't have a way to measure it they

118
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:23,580
don't have a way to understand it they

119
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:25,740
don't have some kind of technology that

120
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:28,020
actually shows the brain under alcohol

121
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:29,520
and what occurs to the brain they don't

122
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:32,160
have any of that

123
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:34,320
all these centuries up until now modern

124
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,600
day science right this minute does not

125
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,419
know what happens when alcohol gets to

126
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:41,340
the brain and we're going to talk about

127
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:43,380
part of what happens is we got a lot of

128
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:44,280
info in here

129
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:46,440
foreign

130
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:48,060
so

131
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:50,220
this is really cool this information

132
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:51,600
okay

133
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:53,940
and so

134
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,620
when alcohol goes to the bloodstream and

135
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:57,300
leads directly to these actions and

136
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:58,680
symptoms they don't know what causes

137
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,780
that and what that means that alcohol

138
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:03,120
itself affects the brain to cause these

139
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:04,740
experiences here's the truth no one

140
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,080
knows exactly what happens inside the

141
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:09,240
brain with alcohol

142
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:12,120
intoxication is not fully understood

143
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:13,919
it's only one aspect of what happens to

144
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:16,259
the brain when someone drinks so they'll

145
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:18,900
be like that person's intoxicated that

146
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:21,120
person has alcohol poisoning that's as

147
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:24,360
far as they can go but what happens

148
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,400
inside our brain another story

149
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:28,860
entirely another story

150
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:31,199
so medical research in science is not

151
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:33,240
going to also put 250 million dollars

152
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,039
into trying to figure out what happens

153
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:37,440
when someone gets alcohol in their

154
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:38,880
system and it goes to the brain

155
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,139
but we're going to talk about it right

156
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:44,280
here because it's really interesting

157
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:47,699
it's one of the reasons why alcohol in

158
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:50,940
tinctures alcohol and supplements of all

159
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:53,280
kinds is a bad idea not only does the

160
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:56,280
alcohol destroy all the different

161
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:58,259
phytochemical compounds in tinctures and

162
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,039
pill form and anything that alcohol's in

163
00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:01,740
right

164
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:04,520
but alcohol alone is bad for the liver

165
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:04,520
bad for the brain

166
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:10,020
so

167
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:12,419
alcohol's effects start out with what is

168
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:14,220
called a little tipsy

169
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:16,320
hey that person's just a little tipsy

170
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:19,380
I'm feeling kind of Tipsy some say

171
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:21,660
alcohol helps them loosen up and speak

172
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:23,699
their mind right so when you drink it's

173
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:26,039
like no I'm getting looser now now I can

174
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:28,500
say what I can say now I can you know

175
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:30,780
now I got some confidence back so a lot

176
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:33,060
of people be like okay well I have to

177
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:34,680
drink to loosen up I'm around some

178
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,780
people I'm around I'm at a meeting

179
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,580
whatever with a bunch of people

180
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:40,740
um you know I'm at an after-hour party

181
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:43,139
it's time to loosen up and be more

182
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:45,180
myself and that's what people do they'll

183
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:46,740
they'll do alcohol for that some say

184
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:48,840
alcohol helps them loosen up and speak

185
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:51,840
their mind some say a couple of beers

186
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:54,780
helps them relax

187
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:57,720
some say wine helps numb them out right

188
00:06:54,780 --> 00:07:01,620
have a hard day you come home you have a

189
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:04,139
glass of wine and then it numbs you out

190
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:06,720
yet how does alcohol seem to loosen them

191
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:08,100
up relax them or numb them out how does

192
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,780
it work

193
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:11,400
and that's where medical research and

194
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:14,819
science is completely unaware they don't

195
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:17,160
know how it loosens the person up

196
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:19,020
when they say that how it numbs them out

197
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:21,900
when they say it numbs them up

198
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:25,199
how to help relax them so they don't

199
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:27,180
know those answers it's as simple as all

200
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,860
they have right now on record as you

201
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:31,440
drink

202
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:34,139
and a person says it helps me loosen up

203
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:36,240
that's as scientific as it gets the

204
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:38,639
person drinks

205
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,319
and they're a little tipsy that's all

206
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,660
they have they don't have anything else

207
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:45,780
in medical research and science or the

208
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:48,720
person drinks and it numbs them up

209
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:51,300
they can have a team of scientists

210
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,740
all this money right lab technicians and

211
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:55,259
they still won't know when someone says

212
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:57,060
whoa yeah that drink helps to relax me

213
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:59,099
or that drink numbs me up they won't

214
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:02,400
have an answer that's scientifically

215
00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:03,960
proven or accurate or anything else

216
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,240
because they're completely in the dark

217
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:07,979
so you guys if you just got in here

218
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,199
we're talking about how alcohol destroys

219
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:13,020
the brain I thought it was a great topic

220
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:15,120
we're in brain saver we're on page 158

221
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:17,580
if you guys want to read along with me

222
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,379
and we're doing three drinks today so

223
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:21,180
I'm excited too we're day one of the

224
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:23,220
medical medium wild blueberry drinks

225
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:25,319
Challenge and we're doing the brain

226
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:27,900
detox tonic we're doing the wild

227
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:30,900
blueberry sangria okay and we're doing a

228
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:33,300
wild blueberry apple cider here we go

229
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:34,740
this next section is called brain

230
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:37,080
charades

231
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:40,320
as we've discussed throughout this book

232
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:41,940
your brain survives on glucose that's

233
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,440
what it runs on

234
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:46,860
our brain

235
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,820
lives off of glucose right that's an

236
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,560
orange

237
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:52,080
right so

238
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:54,779
we need sugar for the brain if you take

239
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:57,360
sugar away from the brain the brain

240
00:08:54,779 --> 00:09:00,420
starts to deteriorate it starts to die

241
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:03,240
it has to have glucose as fuel it has to

242
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:06,839
have sugar blood sugar that's what keeps

243
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:09,420
our brain alive and active

244
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:11,940
a lack of glucose to your brain can

245
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:14,339
slowly starve it over time

246
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:16,620
that's why when people literally remove

247
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:19,200
everything that's a carbohydrate

248
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:21,480
everything that's a sugar whether

249
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,300
natural not natural whatever everything

250
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,860
possible that's a glucose or sugar they

251
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:27,839
literally hit the wall they can't

252
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:30,120
function they can't work and they get in

253
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:32,760
big trouble they can't be productive

254
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:34,740
and if glucose were eliminated from your

255
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:37,380
bloodstream and never entered your brain

256
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:40,320
you could go into brain failure within

257
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:43,019
moments your brain starts to die within

258
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,480
five seconds without getting sugar to it

259
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:48,779
so without getting glucose to your brain

260
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:50,580
it starts to die within seconds think

261
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:52,860
about that for a minute

262
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:54,480
get ready for this

263
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:58,380
alcohol

264
00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:00,360
is the all-time trick on your brain

265
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:03,000
that's because your brain believes

266
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:05,700
alcohol is sugar

267
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,860
sugar it can use so when you drink a

268
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:10,260
drink with alcohol in it

269
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:14,100
your brain gets tricked out

270
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:15,360
it believes it's pure sugar or sugar of

271
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:18,839
some kind

272
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:21,540
so it's an actual trick on the brain

273
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:24,120
it believes it's like the glucose that's

274
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:26,640
created by the foods you eat so when you

275
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:30,420
drink an alcohol beverage

276
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:33,480
your brain believes that the alcohol

277
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:36,060
is like a natural sugar like a sugar

278
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:37,200
from an orange an apple a sugar from

279
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,700
anything

280
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,100
okay

281
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:42,839
so it believes it's like the glucose

282
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:45,200
that's created by the foods you eat that

283
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:49,140
contain carbohydrates and sugar really

284
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:51,300
alcohol is methyl sugar this would be

285
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:53,820
mind-blowing when you hear this it's a

286
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:55,740
hybrid of what sugar

287
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:57,540
what was sugar

288
00:10:55,740 --> 00:11:00,240
so think about that

289
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:01,680
so your brain thinks alcohol is actually

290
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,019
usable sugar

291
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:07,620
and instead

292
00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:09,839
it's not it's methyl sugar it's what

293
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:12,839
sugar was

294
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:15,420
which is this is incredible it's more of

295
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:18,300
a vaporized sugar versus a usable sugar

296
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:21,060
so when you drink an alcoholic beverage

297
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:24,320
it's a vaporized sugar

298
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:29,579
not a usable sugar

299
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:31,500
alcohol's Essence is sugar yet it's not

300
00:11:29,579 --> 00:11:32,700
and this is really cool where it goes

301
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:35,279
right here you guys I'm reading out a

302
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:37,440
brain saver on page 158 still

303
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:40,140
incredible information right here you're

304
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,899
also here with me right now day one for

305
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:44,220
the free medical meeting wild blueberry

306
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:46,560
drinks challenge we're making three

307
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:48,360
drinks hang in there for the ride it's

308
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,700
gonna be fun I got the burner on right

309
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:52,140
here I got all kinds of stuff around me

310
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:54,899
right here stuff over here stuff all

311
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:57,480
over here it's gonna be really cool

312
00:11:54,899 --> 00:12:01,140
actually exciting I love this

313
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:03,839
so you guys this is incredible

314
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:05,399
information it just blows my mind

315
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:08,459
okay

316
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:11,300
as a result of this charade that's

317
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:14,220
played on your brain that leads it to

318
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:18,200
identifying alcohol as critically needed

319
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:18,200
glucose several things go wrong

320
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:23,760
so when you drink the alcoholic beverage

321
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:25,560
and remember medical research designs

322
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,240
that they don't know this

323
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,800
they don't have a study they don't know

324
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,420
what happens when you drink they don't

325
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,040
know why someone loosens up they don't

326
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:34,380
know anything

327
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:36,540
so as a result of this charade plate on

328
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:38,760
your brain that leads it to identify

329
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:41,160
alcohol as critically needed glucose

330
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:42,959
several things go wrong

331
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:47,220
check this out

332
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:50,040
the more alcohol in your bloodstream the

333
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:51,660
harder it is for your brain to use any

334
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,860
real source of glucose in your

335
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:54,660
bloodstream

336
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:57,360
this is original Advanced information

337
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:58,980
from above it's not stuff that you know

338
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,800
gathered off the internet and thrown in

339
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:05,339
a book this is unique information from

340
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:08,220
above always proven right or or never

341
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:10,200
proven wrong so keep that in mind the

342
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:12,360
medical medium book series has never

343
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:15,420
been proven Wrong by science research or

344
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:18,920
scientists yet instead just poached and

345
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:18,920
proven right constantly

346
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:24,240
so this is a really important section

347
00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:25,980
right here probably one of the most

348
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,480
important parts right here so when you

349
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:29,579
think about this I just want to go over

350
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:31,139
this with you one more time because it's

351
00:13:29,579 --> 00:13:32,760
that mind-blowing

352
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:34,980
so

353
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:37,980
the sugar and alcohol is really not

354
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:40,260
there it's the ghost of sugar but your

355
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:43,800
brain thinks it's sugar it's glucose

356
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:45,959
just like something from a fruit or any

357
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:48,180
food

358
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:50,040
as a result of this charade play it on

359
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:51,660
your brain because it's a trick played

360
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,339
on your brain so when you have a glass

361
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:55,139
of wine when you have a shot when you

362
00:13:53,339 --> 00:13:58,019
have alcohol when you have a tincture

363
00:13:55,139 --> 00:14:00,000
with alcohol in it yeah a tincture with

364
00:13:58,019 --> 00:14:02,279
alcohol in it

365
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,760
herbal tincture with alcohol in it

366
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:05,760
terrible terrible

367
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:10,980
your brain identifies alcohol as a

368
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,440
critically needed glucose so what your

369
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:17,100
brain thinks is that it's critical

370
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:19,260
so when you take that alcoholic tincture

371
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:21,000
when you take that supplement that has

372
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:22,380
alcohol in it when you drink a drink

373
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,839
when you have a glass of wine whatever

374
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:26,519
form of alcohol you're doing

375
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:29,459
your brain

376
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:32,339
thinks it's actual usable critically

377
00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:34,260
immediate glucose

378
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:36,300
but several things go wrong the more

379
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:37,980
alcohol in your bloodstream the harder

380
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:39,240
it is for your brain to use any real

381
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:41,600
source of glucose you know what that

382
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,600
means

383
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:50,360
what that means is without usable

384
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:50,360
glucose in your bloodstream you die

385
00:14:50,579 --> 00:14:55,500
your brain runs on sugar

386
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:58,079
it starts dying within five seconds

387
00:14:55,500 --> 00:15:01,220
without glucose

388
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,220
so you see where it's going

389
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:07,079
the more alcohol in your bloodstream the

390
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:09,060
harder it harder it is for your brain to

391
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:11,459
use any real source of glucose in your

392
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:15,480
bloodstream so what happens next

393
00:15:11,459 --> 00:15:18,899
if it's hard for your brain to use any

394
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:23,160
usable glucose resource in your

395
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:26,820
bloodstream your brain starts to starve

396
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:27,720
the more alcohol you drink the more the

397
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:31,440
brain

398
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:34,579
cannot use a glucose to keep it alive

399
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,579
how crazy is that

400
00:15:35,699 --> 00:15:40,380
in alcohol dominates over any glucose

401
00:15:38,579 --> 00:15:43,320
storage left in the brain so here's

402
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:45,420
here's how it works your brain has

403
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:48,060
glucose storages

404
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:49,800
that it pulls from so that if you don't

405
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:52,800
get glucose to your brain within five

406
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:55,199
seconds you hopefully won't die because

407
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:57,600
your brain has enough glucose storage to

408
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:59,519
get you by a few more seconds before

409
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,480
that next round of glucose gets the

410
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:02,480
brain to save it

411
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,940
but what happens is the more alcohol

412
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:10,320
inside your bloodstream the less chance

413
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:14,180
your brain is going to be able to use

414
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:17,760
any usable glucose in even including

415
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:20,940
stored usable glucose in the brain it

416
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:23,519
won't be usable anymore less and less

417
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:24,899
becomes usable you guys just got here

418
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:27,000
we're talking about the brain starving

419
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:28,560
the starving of glucose because of

420
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,660
alcohol use

421
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,040
drinking anything with alcohol that's

422
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:35,459
what we're talking about

423
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:37,740
we're on page 159 of the brain saver

424
00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:39,300
book's greatest book of all time books

425
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:42,420
of all time if you guys have checked him

426
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:46,139
out and read them there's also

427
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:48,839
brain saver protocols okay

428
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:50,220
and we're day one of the free Wild

429
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:52,320
blueberry drinks challenge which is

430
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:54,240
really cool

431
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,980
all right let's get into this a little

432
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,600
bit more and more because this is really

433
00:16:55,980 --> 00:17:00,300
incredible

434
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:03,180
so alcohol dominates over any glucose

435
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:05,640
storage you have left in your brain

436
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:08,280
your liver is your main glucose storage

437
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:12,540
bin so our liver

438
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:16,860
is the main glucose storage bin

439
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:20,360
it's supposed to Harbor all this glucose

440
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:20,360
that helps to protect us

441
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:26,100
its job is to release glucose

442
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:28,380
congruently as your brain needs it so

443
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:29,820
your liver releases that glucose as your

444
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,679
brain needs it

445
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:34,919
there are moments when we aren't getting

446
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:37,140
enough sugar or glucose or fructose or

447
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:39,720
any kind of carbohydrate in our diet and

448
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:40,919
we go into glucose deficits in the

449
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:43,679
bloodstream

450
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:45,660
your liver's job in that case is to

451
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:48,600
release glucose so your brain doesn't

452
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:50,880
completely starve

453
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:52,559
so your liver has a job and that's why

454
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,880
it's critical to keep our livers healthy

455
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:56,400
that's why medical medium information

456
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:59,340
has advanced liver knowledge like a

457
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:02,039
Liver Rescue right and and all the other

458
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:04,679
medical medium books

459
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:08,039
and so the job of the liver is to Harbor

460
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:11,400
and keep healthy glucose storage bins so

461
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:12,600
that when you run low

462
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,940
yeah

463
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:18,120
when you run low

464
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:19,919
that glucose gets needed and used how

465
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:21,480
incredible Lorraine L says this chapter

466
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,820
put me off

467
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:26,160
ever having another drop of alcohol

468
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:28,260
incredible

469
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,480
this includes circumstances where you

470
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:33,120
aren't getting you weren't eating for a

471
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:35,700
long period of time if you don't eat for

472
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:38,039
a long period of time which could happen

473
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:40,440
for instance say you get food poisoning

474
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:42,780
say you're one of those lucky people

475
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:45,780
or unfortunate people however you want

476
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:47,880
to look at it that gets food poisoning a

477
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:50,520
bad case of food poisoning how about a

478
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:51,960
stomach flu too and you can't eat

479
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:54,360
anything

480
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:57,000
for a while food poisoning especially

481
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:59,940
where you can't even drink anything

482
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,160
you're in the hospital you're hooked up

483
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:03,960
to Morphine you have the worst stomach

484
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,000
pain you ever had in your life because

485
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:08,280
you got E coli poisoning or some other

486
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,679
foodborne illness

487
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:13,080
and you're suffering for a day and you

488
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:17,039
can't really get any glucose then your

489
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:19,140
liver releases glucose Darcy Lee says I

490
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:21,600
was drinking vodka because I was low

491
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:23,640
carb what a huge mistake

492
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,559
you're on Facebook that's really

493
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:28,020
interesting I know wait to hear the rest

494
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:30,419
of what I have to read you guys it's

495
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:32,580
like mind-blowing

496
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:34,140
so this includes circumstances where you

497
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:36,660
aren't eating enough in a long period of

498
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:39,720
time remember without glucose your brain

499
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:42,480
can't survive your brain

500
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:46,200
cannot survive

501
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:48,620
without glucose it dies fast and it gets

502
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,620
us in trouble

503
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:54,840
the liver fulfilling this role is why

504
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:59,360
someone can do a water fast and their

505
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:59,360
brain can survive the experience

506
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:03,000
and that's the problem even with water

507
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:05,640
fasting

508
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,500
water fasting so-called experts don't

509
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:09,480
even realize it

510
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:11,460
the person and how much glucose they

511
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:13,559
have in their liver or glycogen storage

512
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:15,179
they have in their brain determines if

513
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:16,559
they can even water fast but no one

514
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:17,700
would ever know that there's no way to

515
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:19,140
measure that there's no way to

516
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:21,480
understand that that's why some people

517
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:23,220
go into a water fast they bottom out

518
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:25,260
real fast

519
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:27,179
and they hit the wall and they're in bad

520
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:29,039
shape and then other people can seem

521
00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:30,780
like they go longer and longer on a

522
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:33,960
water fast because what they don't

523
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:35,580
realize is they're living off of glucose

524
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:37,880
storage that's sitting inside their

525
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:37,880
liver

526
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:41,880
so the liver fulfilling this role is why

527
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,440
someone who can you know can do a water

528
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,940
fast and their brain can survive the

529
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,100
experience because the liver is

530
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:52,140
releasing ample glucose for the brain

531
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:54,480
our liver releases glucose for our brain

532
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:56,580
glycogen reserves in the brain and

533
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,679
glucose reserves in the liver determine

534
00:20:56,580 --> 00:21:01,380
how long someone can withstand a water

535
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:04,260
fast now not everybody's liver functions

536
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:08,039
that well and that's another thing too

537
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:10,380
I've seen people do a water fast

538
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:12,059
and they can do it longer

539
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:14,039
because their liver was functioning

540
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:15,780
better and they had a large glucose

541
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:17,880
storage bin and then I've seen other

542
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:21,179
people do water fast

543
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:22,080
and they were just boom down for the

544
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:23,880
count

545
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:26,220
the liver wasn't a healthy liver didn't

546
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,960
have a large glucose storage they had no

547
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:29,760
glucose to feed the brain why they were

548
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:31,080
just out of water

549
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,640
and they just went

550
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:35,400
[Music]

551
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:38,340
even like into psychosis

552
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:40,200
where they just went into psychosis like

553
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:43,679
boom

554
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:45,780
it's that person you hear about

555
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,580
through somebody for somebody right that

556
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:48,720
was at a fasting clinic and they were

557
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:50,820
literally

558
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,740
in a psychotic episode when they weren't

559
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:54,059
ever psychotic before

560
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:57,120
it's because

561
00:21:54,059 --> 00:21:59,700
they didn't have enough glucose storage

562
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,200
bin inside their liver to get to their

563
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:02,640
brain while they were water fasting but

564
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,720
I'm just using water fasting as an

565
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,340
example

566
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:07,500
I'm talking about everyday living we

567
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:09,240
need that glucose and our liver releases

568
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:11,700
that glucose to the brain on everyday

569
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:14,520
living too

570
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:16,559
many people's glucose storage bins can

571
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:18,720
be minimally due

572
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:20,760
to the liver being sluggish or stagnant

573
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,039
wrote a whole book about that

574
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:25,320
taught about that for years

575
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:27,120
so drinking alcohol can affect these

576
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:28,740
people more than alcohol affects people

577
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,820
with strong livers you ever hear that I

578
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:31,320
just want to go over this for a second

579
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:33,059
because this is really an incredible

580
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:34,980
point

581
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:37,740
you heard that person where I can handle

582
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:39,720
alcohol no I can't handle alcohol

583
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:41,640
I can handle more than a few drinks I

584
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:43,380
can't handle more than a half a drink

585
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:45,840
you hear that right

586
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:47,159
so I want to talk about this in a minute

587
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,320
but first I want to make an announcement

588
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:50,880
we are in the medical medium while

and description

605
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:25,700
all right you guys

606
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:31,679
check this out right you heard someone

607
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:32,880
say before I could handle alcohol

608
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:35,159
right

609
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:37,140
my friend Bryce

610
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:38,100
my friend Bryce says he can handle

611
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:40,500
alcohol

612
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:43,020
like it he can handle a few shots easy

613
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:46,140
right then I know people they can't

614
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:48,419
handle alcohol on any level

615
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:51,539
there's a reason for that

616
00:23:48,419 --> 00:23:53,880
it's Whoever has the stronger liver

617
00:23:51,539 --> 00:23:57,419
can handle alcohol

618
00:23:53,880 --> 00:24:00,659
longer or more larger amounts of alcohol

619
00:23:57,419 --> 00:24:03,720
if someone has a weaker liver stagnant

620
00:24:00,659 --> 00:24:06,720
sluggish problematic

621
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:08,340
that's another story that means we got a

622
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,600
liver that can't handle alcohol but

623
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:11,580
there's a reason for it because that

624
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:14,640
liver is dense that liver is hardened

625
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:16,919
the liver stagnant sluggish

626
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:19,020
it's also why as people age they can't

627
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:21,000
handle alcohol as much either well you

628
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:23,400
know in my college Years

629
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,440
I could just totally get shit-faced in

630
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:27,179
my college years and just whatever I

631
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,740
could drink drink drink I could put a

632
00:24:27,179 --> 00:24:30,900
tube down my throat somebody could be

633
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:34,260
standing on the bar and dumping down

634
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:36,240
like gallons of alcohol

635
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:37,620
but then their liver gets stagnant and

636
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,360
sluggish over time and when they get

637
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:41,220
older they're like I can't handle that

638
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:43,080
much no no that's good she can stop

639
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:45,780
pouring it from there well I could just

640
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:48,000
have one shot you hear that right

641
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:49,620
so I'm back to the book I'm on page 159

642
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,299
a brain saver I'm reading right out of

643
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:54,240
the book now this is unique information

644
00:24:51,299 --> 00:24:56,220
by the way about how alcohol destroys

645
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,780
the brain how it works science and

646
00:24:56,220 --> 00:25:00,419
research does not know they don't know

647
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:02,340
what happens when you drink where that

648
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:04,380
alcohol how it goes to the brain and

649
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:05,400
what happens inside the brain they have

650
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:08,159
no idea

651
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:11,539
but they will now because this

652
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:11,539
information is getting out there

653
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,539
that's why some say I can't handle

654
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:19,020
alcohol

655
00:25:15,539 --> 00:25:21,000
or he can't handle his liquor

656
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:24,480
because their livers are weakened

657
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,039
especially as they age

658
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,559
regardless if someone's alcohol

659
00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:33,020
tolerance when enough alcohol is

660
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:33,020
consumed the effects are all the same

661
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,840
that point right there is mind-blowing

662
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:39,419
regardless of someone's alcohol

663
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:43,200
tolerance

664
00:25:39,419 --> 00:25:45,419
right besides that when regardless of

665
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:48,240
that when enough alcohol is consumed for

666
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:50,340
anybody any individual whether they can

667
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:53,039
handle their liquor or not

668
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:55,799
the effects are all the same as you're

669
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:57,480
drinking alcohol it starts to poison and

670
00:25:55,799 --> 00:25:59,760
numb the liver

671
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:02,400
so the first thing is they say right so

672
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:05,220
you heard science say this well you

673
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:08,000
drink too much you hurt your liver that

674
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:08,000
part is known

675
00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:12,000
so as you're drinking alcohol it starts

676
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:14,460
to poison and numb the liver but what

677
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,480
they don't know is it starts to numb the

678
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:17,760
liver

679
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:20,100
they don't know what it does to the

680
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:22,440
liver they don't understand what happens

681
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:24,720
to the liver so science research doesn't

682
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:27,360
know what happens to the liver when you

683
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:29,640
drink they just guesstimate that a

684
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:32,159
person lifelong drinking

685
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:34,380
gets cirrhosis of the liver but that's

686
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:36,179
not even totally accurate I've known

687
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:38,100
people that do lifelong drinking and

688
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:40,559
don't have cirrhosis of the liver see

689
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:42,480
they don't even know that

690
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:44,460
as you're drinking alcohol it starts to

691
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,799
poison and numb the liver and your liver

692
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:48,480
is your defense mechanism to stop

693
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:51,179
alcohol from getting to your brain that

694
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:53,220
part they don't know

695
00:26:51,179 --> 00:26:55,320
so science and research does not know

696
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:57,299
that your liver is your defense

697
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:59,520
mechanism to stop alcohol from getting

698
00:26:57,299 --> 00:27:00,900
to the brain they don't have that

699
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,960
information

700
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:06,000
it is your line of defense to stop the

701
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:09,919
poison from getting here

702
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,919
that's what your liver is

703
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:14,520
by the time you start getting tipsy or

704
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:16,440
whatever you personally call the

705
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:17,820
beginning stages of feeling alcohol's

706
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:19,500
effects because everybody has a

707
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:21,480
different term somebody might say I'm

708
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:23,220
tipsy someone might say I'm starting to

709
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:24,900
loosen up someone might say I'm starting

710
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:27,960
to get drunk everybody has a different

711
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:30,480
terminology when they're drinking

712
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:33,299
no matter how mild your liver is already

713
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:36,360
at its saturation level for protecting

714
00:27:33,299 --> 00:27:38,580
your brain so that is something medical

715
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:40,860
research and science has no idea about I

716
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:43,320
know this is going to get poached the

717
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:46,860
minute you start feeling whatever you

718
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:49,140
call that name Tipsy or feeling a little

719
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:51,480
drunk or feelings like loosening up

720
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:52,860
whatever the term is that you use when

721
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:55,020
you're drinking

722
00:27:52,860 --> 00:28:00,000
that means

723
00:27:55,020 --> 00:28:01,559
your liver is at its level it's at its

724
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,600
Tipping Point

725
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:05,159
so keep that in mind so it could be

726
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,260
anybody that's just like oh I'm getting

727
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:09,480
a little tipsy

728
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:11,820
oh I'm kidding I'm feeling a little kind

729
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:14,580
of you know loose now I'm feeling like

730
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:17,700
okay I can you know speak my mind

731
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:19,799
whatever it is that you feel

732
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:21,600
so whatever you personally call the

733
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:23,700
beginning stages of feeling alcohol's

734
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:25,500
effects no matter how mild your liver is

735
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:27,600
already at its saturation level for

736
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:29,700
protecting the brain so that means your

737
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:32,100
liver

738
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:33,419
can't protect your brain anymore you

739
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:36,240
bypassed it

740
00:28:33,419 --> 00:28:38,820
and that right there

741
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:41,400
is incredible information from above

742
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:43,200
Nobody Knows the minute you feel that

743
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:46,820
sensation

744
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,820
you already bypass

745
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:54,120
your liver's defense mechanisms

746
00:28:51,659 --> 00:28:56,400
that's what occurred

747
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:59,100
when we talk about moderation with

748
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:01,020
alcohol we miss the crucial point

749
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:04,200
I know you guys people are people have

750
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:05,400
been slamming moderation at me again I

751
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,380
noticed some of the haters out there

752
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:09,900
they'll use that one they'd be like well

753
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:11,340
I think moderation is just a healthy way

754
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:13,500
of doing things tell that to a

755
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:16,919
chronically ill person

756
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:19,440
who literally can't heal because they're

757
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:21,720
letting the whole moderation right

758
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:24,000
gaslighting the moderation gas lighting

759
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:26,159
take over and then they're stuck in the

760
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,740
moderation game and then they're afraid

761
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:30,539
to do the right things to heal because

762
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:32,220
they're thinking they have to be in

763
00:29:30,539 --> 00:29:34,500
moderation like that's a healthier

764
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:37,799
Pursuit

765
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:39,899
alcohol is toxic in any amount so the

766
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:42,120
liver's job is to soak up every last

767
00:29:39,899 --> 00:29:44,279
drop it can when your liver is being

768
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:47,240
poisoned by alcohol it can't release

769
00:29:44,279 --> 00:29:47,240
glucose anymore

770
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:51,600
that's something to know right there

771
00:29:49,799 --> 00:29:54,360
remember I was telling you guys earlier

772
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:56,539
reading out the book here brain saver

773
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:58,799
the minute

774
00:29:56,539 --> 00:30:01,260
your liver

775
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:03,120
starts to get that that alcohol

776
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:04,679
poisoning it can't release that glucose

777
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:06,120
anymore

778
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:08,760
because the liver's job a healthy

779
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:10,020
liver's job or even a liver that's

780
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:11,760
actually stagnant sluggish and

781
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:14,520
problematic

782
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:17,520
the liver's job is to release glucose to

783
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:19,740
your brain so your brain uses glucose

784
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:22,500
that comes from your liver

785
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:25,320
but the minute your liver is being

786
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:27,659
saturated by alcohol and you hit that

787
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:29,880
saturation point the liver cannot

788
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:32,100
release glucose to your brain anymore so

789
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:35,120
when someone's drinking no more glucose

790
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:35,120
gets to the brain anymore

791
00:30:36,059 --> 00:30:39,360
I want to show you the book right here

792
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:40,799
guys by the way because someone is

793
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,419
asking they're saying show the book

794
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:43,980
cover

795
00:30:42,419 --> 00:30:46,860
that's the book cover

796
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:49,679
right there it's brain saver and brain

797
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:50,940
saver protocol so make sure you get both

798
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:52,679
books

799
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:55,320
right

800
00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:57,240
Luke Roger says mm info took me out of

801
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:59,539
suffering appreciate you aw appreciate

802
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,539
you too

803
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:05,820
so we're taught you guys let's just

804
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:07,380
let's just uh talk about this we're

805
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:09,240
making three drinks pretty soon hang in

806
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:11,700
there I'm reading straight out of brain

807
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:13,620
saver we're talking about the topic how

808
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:15,360
alcohol destroys the brain

809
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:17,279
we're talking about how it does we're

810
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:19,440
going into incredible unique original

811
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:21,059
information from above about how alcohol

812
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,960
has effects on the brain and how it

813
00:31:21,059 --> 00:31:23,580
works

814
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:25,020
so we're doing that we're also making

815
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:26,039
three drinks pretty soon so hang in

816
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:27,419
there we're making a wild blueberry

817
00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:29,520
apple cider which is actually really

818
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:31,860
cool one of my favorites by the way

819
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:33,120
some pumped up about that

820
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:35,360
but we're going to read a little bit

821
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,360
more

822
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:40,080
even if someone has a large storage bin

823
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:42,960
of glucose eventually the liver becomes

824
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:45,360
Paralyzed by the by the alcohol

825
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:47,760
in this vitally important function so

826
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:50,159
you can be a dude

827
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:52,500
you can be somebody it's got a strong

828
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:55,500
liver you're young you got a liver

829
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:58,140
that's not oversaturated

830
00:31:55,500 --> 00:32:00,120
and you could be drinking and the minute

831
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:02,460
you hit that point where you start

832
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:04,740
feeling the effects of the alcohol do

833
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:07,380
something for your body that means your

834
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:09,600
liver is at its saturation point now for

835
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:11,700
one dude that could be like 10 shots of

836
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:13,500
whiskey for someone else it could be a

837
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:16,140
sip of whiskey but the point is is

838
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:18,659
that's when the liver stops

839
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:20,520
feeding the brain and releasing glucose

840
00:32:18,659 --> 00:32:22,380
to the brain

841
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:25,320
because the liver's job of releasing

842
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:27,720
glucose is halted it stopped its job

843
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:29,340
instead becomes soaking up alcohol so

844
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:31,200
here's how it goes

845
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:33,240
the liver's there to protect your brain

846
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:35,220
the more we drink

847
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:37,140
the liver is trying to stop that alcohol

848
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:38,940
from getting to the brain it can't

849
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:41,640
release glucose anymore to your brain

850
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:43,799
because it has to quit all its jobs it

851
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:46,799
has to stop working and it has to now be

852
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:48,299
just a sponge for the alcohol

853
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:51,480
here's the question right here I like

854
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:53,520
his recipes and some of the stuff he has

855
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:55,620
but saying that professionals don't know

856
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:57,539
about the liver and alcohol poisoning

857
00:32:55,620 --> 00:33:00,059
and acting like the frontier of science

858
00:32:57,539 --> 00:33:02,159
with no scientific findings very

859
00:33:00,059 --> 00:33:03,059
interesting okay well that's kind of

860
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:06,779
funny

861
00:33:03,059 --> 00:33:08,820
because I published how the cause of

862
00:33:06,779 --> 00:33:11,880
multiple sclerosis is Epstein-Barr virus

863
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:14,840
but I published it also in details so

864
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,840
listen to this

865
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:20,460
almost eight years later Harvard took

866
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:22,260
that information and put it out there as

867
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:23,820
if they discovered it when it was

868
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:26,220
already published

869
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:28,200
and in New York Times best-selling book

870
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:30,840
and millions of those copies went around

871
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:34,019
the world and it became the number one

872
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:36,600
health book in the world so I got no

873
00:33:34,019 --> 00:33:39,240
credibility you're saying when literally

874
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:40,799
science is poaching information which is

875
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:42,480
illegal

876
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:45,299
illegal

877
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,799
that's what legal tells me

878
00:33:45,299 --> 00:33:49,860
and they're poaching that information

879
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:52,620
for their big universities out of little

880
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:54,360
old me a guy who knows nothing

881
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:57,179
out of his books that are best-selling

882
00:33:54,360 --> 00:34:00,299
books New York Times bestselling books

883
00:33:57,179 --> 00:34:01,679
and how about this one the true cause of

884
00:34:00,299 --> 00:34:04,919
long covet

885
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:06,299
is reactivated Epstein-Barr another one

886
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:08,159
two

887
00:34:06,299 --> 00:34:09,060
and that comes out of all this right

888
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:10,859
here

889
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:13,139
this book

890
00:34:10,859 --> 00:34:15,179
so why is science taking all my

891
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:16,020
information because I published that

892
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:19,139
first

893
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:21,119
that long-haul covid is reactivated fcmr

894
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:22,919
why is science taking my information if

895
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:25,379
I have no credibility

896
00:34:22,919 --> 00:34:28,139
why are they using all my info and how

897
00:34:25,379 --> 00:34:30,359
about this why is alternative medicine

898
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:32,520
stealing all of the medical media book

899
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:34,020
information too those are just a couple

900
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:35,839
of examples

901
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:38,639
so before you say something like that

902
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:40,379
kind of like learn about this and learn

903
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:43,440
about the medical medium history right

904
00:34:40,379 --> 00:34:44,339
read the books learn find out what's out

905
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,500
there

906
00:34:44,339 --> 00:34:48,419
so think about that right there so yes

907
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:50,280
this is original unique information that

908
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:51,839
comes from above it gets published in

909
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:54,659
the medical medium books first and then

910
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:56,280
poached later and yes I'm sorry but

911
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:58,020
medical research and science doesn't

912
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:59,880
know what happens to the brain with

913
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:02,760
alcohol they still don't know

914
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:05,280
doctors even drink and they don't know

915
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:06,599
why they get tipsy or drunk and they

916
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:10,920
don't know what happens to the brain

917
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:12,599
while they're drinking so yeah sorry

918
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:15,000
but I really like the question though

919
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:16,680
because it it's great because it helps

920
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,119
me plug the fact that science is always

921
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:20,400
stealing all medical meaning books and

922
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:22,800
information so that's kind of cool all

923
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:25,079
right check this out

924
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,720
here's a cool part right here and I'm

925
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:29,700
glad you love medical medium information

926
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:32,099
because that was part of your comment I

927
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:34,260
love this info but

928
00:35:32,099 --> 00:35:38,460
all right that's what people do now too

929
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:40,800
it's like I love I love his info uh but

930
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:42,780
um yeah that's what they do like you see

931
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:45,240
it every day now

932
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:47,940
I bet you love the info because heck

933
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:49,859
it's saved a lot of lives

934
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:51,180
all right let's go into it man because

935
00:35:49,859 --> 00:35:53,820
we got a little bit more and then we're

936
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:55,859
gonna make some drinks okay ready at the

937
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:58,560
same time at the same time alcohol

938
00:35:55,859 --> 00:36:00,480
pushes aside any glucose that is in the

939
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:03,359
bloodstream so alcohol becomes the

940
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:05,520
brain's number one choice for fuel

941
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:07,740
and you can you please tell me where

942
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:10,140
that is in science research

943
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:11,400
[ __ ] can you find that somewhere that

944
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:14,220
alcohol

945
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:16,920
actually pushes glucose out of the

946
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:18,599
bloodstream and then alcohol itself

947
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,980
becomes the brain's number one form of

948
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:22,020
glucose

949
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:23,760
meaning fuel can you tell me where that

950
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:26,339
is is that in a research paper somewhere

951
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:28,320
no but it will be in five years and I'll

952
00:36:26,339 --> 00:36:31,980
be proven right

953
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:33,900
because alcohol seems like glucose even

954
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:36,300
though in the end it isn't so remember I

955
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:38,700
was telling you alcohol is the ghost of

956
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:40,619
sugar your brain gets tricked out and

957
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:42,960
believes that alcohol is actually

958
00:36:40,619 --> 00:36:44,940
glucose a fuel

959
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:47,220
the more alcohol you put in your

960
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:49,380
bloodstream the more your brain

961
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:52,500
identifies

962
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:54,240
the alcohol instead of glucose and

963
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:55,619
here's another problem when you get

964
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:57,720
alcohol in your bloodstream and this is

965
00:36:55,619 --> 00:36:59,339
unknown to research in science when you

966
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:01,440
get alcohol in your bloodstream it

967
00:36:59,339 --> 00:37:04,740
pushes glucose out

968
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:07,320
it pushes glucose away from the brain

969
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:10,079
your brain can only identify that

970
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:12,180
alcohol down

971
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:14,880
you guys I want to ask you guys a

972
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:17,220
question can you just be frank with me

973
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:19,619
and can you just be like open with me on

974
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:21,599
this okay I'm just sidetracked right now

975
00:37:19,619 --> 00:37:26,220
completely

976
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:28,740
if the information from these incredible

977
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:31,260
eight books in the medical medium book

978
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:32,880
series is original and unique

979
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:34,560
and most of you guys know that because

980
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,700
you've been there and done that and did

981
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,800
everything

982
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:39,180
am I supposed to hide that and never say

983
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:42,839
that

984
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:45,180
like am I supposed to pretend that I got

985
00:37:42,839 --> 00:37:47,700
all this information in these volumes of

986
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:49,380
books from some other source like some

987
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:50,760
study or something when it doesn't exist

988
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:54,300
and there is no study with all this

989
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:58,280
information am I supposed to lie and say

990
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:58,280
that my information isn't original

991
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:04,920
so I can fit in everywhere and not get

992
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:06,839
like kicked you know kicked in the back

993
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:08,520
I just want you to people okay let me

994
00:38:06,839 --> 00:38:10,140
just ask you guys this this is just a

995
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:11,160
heart to heart I I know what a lot of

996
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:12,839
you guys are here for the drinks and I'm

997
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:15,060
about to make them but this is a heart

998
00:38:12,839 --> 00:38:15,839
to heart what would you do please tell

999
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:17,940
me

1000
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:19,560
if you woke up at the age of four one

1001
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:21,599
morning and you heard a voice and it

1002
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:23,579
gave you Advanced information

1003
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:25,680
that has saved

1004
00:38:23,579 --> 00:38:28,260
countless lives you put that information

1005
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:31,140
in incredible book series

1006
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:32,520
there's not one eat better book out

1007
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:34,380
there and this isn't an eat better book

1008
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:37,020
there's not one healthy book out there

1009
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:39,180
in the in the alternative genre anywhere

1010
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:40,200
that has this information and that much

1011
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:42,300
right

1012
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:45,540
what would you do would you sit there

1013
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:46,920
and be afraid to actually say it comes

1014
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:49,800
from above

1015
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:51,420
would you be afraid to tell the truth

1016
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,560
that the information is unique and

1017
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:54,480
original

1018
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,380
and it can't be found anywhere but the

1019
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,060
books

1020
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:59,460
and you can prove it

1021
00:38:57,060 --> 00:39:00,480
would you lie so you can fit in with

1022
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:02,339
everybody

1023
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:04,920
would you lie so you could have

1024
00:39:02,339 --> 00:39:06,300
so-called credibility with everybody I

1025
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:07,800
want to know what you would do tell me

1026
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:10,260
what you would do

1027
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:12,300
because

1028
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:14,700
because as a humanitarian because that's

1029
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:16,800
what a humanitarian is someone who saves

1030
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:18,540
lives right I'm a messenger for Spirit

1031
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:21,480
of compassion to get the information out

1032
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:23,820
there and on a humanitarian way

1033
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:25,740
am I supposed to lie

1034
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:27,900
I want to know what you would do if you

1035
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:30,359
had all this original information that's

1036
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:33,599
never been published anywhere no study

1037
00:39:30,359 --> 00:39:36,240
no science no anything tell me what

1038
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:38,160
would you do would you lie and say that

1039
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:39,420
you got it from a research paper when it

1040
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:41,339
doesn't exist just to make somebody

1041
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:44,160
happy or would you say it was unique

1042
00:39:41,339 --> 00:39:47,780
original and pure and untouched and it

1043
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:47,780
comes from above like the truth

1044
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:53,460
because I still get punished every day

1045
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:55,460
by somebody saying how dare you say

1046
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:57,720
that your own information

1047
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:59,280
is not original or unique and you

1048
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:01,859
shouldn't be saying that so I would like

1049
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:04,680
to know what you guys would do would you

1050
00:40:01,859 --> 00:40:06,839
hide it would you live a why would you

1051
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:08,460
pretend it wasn't coming from above and

1052
00:40:06,839 --> 00:40:10,820
then pretend you got it somewhere where

1053
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:10,820
you didn't

1054
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:15,119
all right if you just got here we're day

1055
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:16,859
one of the medical medium wild blueberry

1056
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:19,619
drinks challenge we still got something

1057
00:40:16,859 --> 00:40:22,500
to do the amount of hate and attacks I

1058
00:40:19,619 --> 00:40:24,780
get is unreal you guys have no idea

1059
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:26,640
and a lot of you don't see the amount of

1060
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:28,859
pushback I get for sharing this

1061
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:30,780
information so people can heal it's

1062
00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:34,740
unreal

1063
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:37,440
it's unreal and I could stop tomorrow

1064
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:39,420
I could literally stop tomorrow

1065
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:41,760
and just call it quits

1066
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:43,560
easily and just say I'm done

1067
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:45,000
but I'm in it for the chronically ill

1068
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:46,200
and I'm gonna fight fight for The

1069
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,700
Chronic Leo and that's what keeps me

1070
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:49,680
doing it

1071
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:51,180
and you know and that's why you guys

1072
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,859
when you share this information and

1073
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:54,780
everything citing Vector medical means

1074
00:40:52,859 --> 00:40:58,020
important of course all that

1075
00:40:54,780 --> 00:41:00,000
and it's all free I don't charge for it

1076
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:01,500
am I doing groups and you know and

1077
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,880
charging five thousand dollars for a

1078
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:05,160
group three thousand dollars for a group

1079
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:07,260
of people to join in and then give them

1080
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:10,800
some like packet and a bunch of info and

1081
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:13,079
right am I doing that no it's free it's

1082
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:15,240
in the books but I do notice that a lot

1083
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:16,500
of people don't read the books and they

1084
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,460
did a little celery just for a little

1085
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:19,740
while

1086
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:21,900
they tried maybe a little something but

1087
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:23,880
they didn't read the books and learn and

1088
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:25,740
then they go join these groups that are

1089
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:27,720
charging three thousand five thousand

1090
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:30,060
dollars two thousand dollars they join

1091
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:32,579
these groups to learn information that's

1092
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:35,400
not even medical medium it's a hosh posh

1093
00:41:32,579 --> 00:41:37,500
and mishmash of everything else

1094
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:39,000
it's just so sad

1095
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:41,700
okay so let's go at the same time

1096
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,740
alcohol pushes aside any glucose that is

1097
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:45,900
in the bloodstream so alcohol becomes

1098
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:47,339
the brain's number one choice for fuel

1099
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:49,740
so this is really important right here

1100
00:41:47,339 --> 00:41:51,900
because alcohol seems like glucose even

1101
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:55,140
though in the end it isn't so here's how

1102
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:57,839
it works alcohol when you drink it

1103
00:41:55,140 --> 00:42:00,900
seems like glucose to the brain but it

1104
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:03,060
isn't but yet the brain only chooses

1105
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:04,920
that glucose when it's saturated in the

1106
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:07,500
bloodstream because alcohol pushes all

1107
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:10,380
glucose away including numbing up the

1108
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:13,920
liver shutting it down so it can't

1109
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:17,400
actually release glucose alcohol is a

1110
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:21,480
byproduct of glucose it's a byproduct of

1111
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:24,839
sugar it's a ghost of what sugar was

1112
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:27,240
so the brain becomes a victim of the

1113
00:42:24,839 --> 00:42:28,440
ghost effect of alcohol so when you see

1114
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:32,339
somebody drinking and they're getting

1115
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:36,180
tipsy their brain becomes a victim to

1116
00:42:32,339 --> 00:42:38,220
the ghost effect of what was alcohol

1117
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:39,720
that piece of information when I got

1118
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:41,640
that from Spirit compassion I was just

1119
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:43,619
like blown away because how crazy is

1120
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:46,560
that

1121
00:42:43,619 --> 00:42:50,720
it's a ghost of what sugar was

1122
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:50,720
it's mind-blowing information

1123
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:57,000
so the brain becomes a victim of the

1124
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:59,579
ghost effect of alcohol

1125
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:02,940
that's what happens as more alcohol

1126
00:42:59,579 --> 00:43:04,079
enters the brain a person exhibits more

1127
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:06,060
drunken

1128
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:09,540
that is

1129
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:12,420
Behavior when someone gets to the point

1130
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:15,180
of drunken Behavior slurred speech

1131
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:17,160
inability to function normally that

1132
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:18,960
means the brain is already starting to

1133
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:20,460
starve to death

1134
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:23,040
check this out

1135
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:25,380
this is how mind-blowing this is

1136
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:28,560
when you're at the point of slurring

1137
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:31,800
your speech when drinking

1138
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:33,900
your brain is already starting to starve

1139
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:36,480
to death so what you're witnessing from

1140
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:38,640
the person is a person's brain starving

1141
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:40,200
to death so if you're hanging out with a

1142
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:41,460
bunch of friends and people are slurring

1143
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:44,339
their speech because they're drinking

1144
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:45,780
what you're witnessing is their brain is

1145
00:43:44,339 --> 00:43:48,420
starving to death

1146
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:50,880
it's dying

1147
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:52,680
it's actually dying if you have a party

1148
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:55,260
filled with people that are drunk or

1149
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:56,940
getting drunk what you're seeing with

1150
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:58,440
them walking around and kind of like

1151
00:43:56,940 --> 00:44:00,060
walking around like this and slurring

1152
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:01,800
your speech what you're seeing is their

1153
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:07,220
brains are actually dying they're

1154
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:07,220
starving to death how insane is that

1155
00:44:07,619 --> 00:44:12,240
and here's a key understanding most of

1156
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:14,400
the symptoms we associate with

1157
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:16,560
drunkenness and alcohol poisoning are

1158
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:19,079
only from alcohol itself

1159
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:21,480
most are symptoms of the brain starting

1160
00:44:19,079 --> 00:44:25,140
to die

1161
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:27,359
you guys when someone is experiencing a

1162
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:30,540
symptom of drunkenness

1163
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:33,380
what it is it's a symptom of the brain

1164
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:33,380
starting to die

1165
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,940
unbelievable anyway you guys we're day

1166
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,380
one to Medical mean and while

1167
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:41,579
blueberries challenge we're gonna make

1168
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:43,619
three drinks

1169
00:44:41,579 --> 00:44:45,839
Deborah says this information is

1170
00:44:43,619 --> 00:44:48,060
mind-blowing the more alcohol you

1171
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:50,460
consume in an evening or day the less

1172
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:53,579
glucose the brain absorbs and then fuels

1173
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:56,220
itself with if we think of the Optimum

1174
00:44:53,579 --> 00:44:58,260
as 100 of glucose entering the brain and

1175
00:44:56,220 --> 00:45:00,540
keeping it alive then drinking alcohol

1176
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:02,099
brings that glucose performance down to

1177
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:07,440
five or ten percent

1178
00:45:02,099 --> 00:45:09,300
depending on how drunken someone is

1179
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:11,040
that means that we're supposed to be

1180
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:13,319
getting a hundred percent glucose

1181
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:15,180
Optimum levels of glucose to the brain

1182
00:45:13,319 --> 00:45:16,560
on a daily level when you're drinking

1183
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:18,960
and getting drunk you're only getting

1184
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:20,700
five to ten percent levels of glucose to

1185
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:22,880
the brain as your brain is starving to

1186
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:22,880
death

1187
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:28,980
it's like taking a fish out of water

1188
00:45:25,319 --> 00:45:31,800
watching it gasp for air on the beach as

1189
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:33,540
it takes in oxygen instead of water then

1190
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:35,099
putting it back in the water to revive

1191
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:36,540
it and then taking it back out that's

1192
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:39,119
like putting a fish

1193
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:43,260
on the land or pulling it out of a tank

1194
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:45,720
watching it gasp as its brain starts to

1195
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:48,359
die and then dropping the fish back into

1196
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:50,099
the water and letting the brain revive

1197
00:45:48,359 --> 00:45:52,440
then pulling the fish back out of the

1198
00:45:50,099 --> 00:45:54,300
water and watching it gasp for air and

1199
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:57,260
then dropping it back in the tank and

1200
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:57,260
watching it revive

1201
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:02,280
the fish will stay alive although it

1202
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:04,800
pays the price for being thrust into

1203
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:07,380
survival mode this is what happens when

1204
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:09,359
someone drinks alcohol regularly just

1205
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:12,000
enough glucose is getting to the brain

1206
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:13,800
to keep the person alive yet it's so

1207
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,380
little that the person loses the ability

1208
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:19,319
to function because they're drunk you

1209
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:22,220
become a walking talking example of a

1210
00:46:19,319 --> 00:46:22,220
Dying brain

1211
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:29,280
alcohol dominates our over glucose

1212
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:32,099
getting to the brain because not only is

1213
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:33,839
the liver intoxicated paralyzed and

1214
00:46:32,099 --> 00:46:35,880
cannot release enough glucose to get to

1215
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:37,920
the brain but the brain chooses alcohol

1216
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:39,720
over glucose

1217
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:41,760
this is not because the brain needs

1218
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:43,319
alcohol or because alcohol is good for

1219
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:45,420
the brain again it's because the brain

1220
00:46:43,319 --> 00:46:47,460
is being tricked into thinking the

1221
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:49,140
alcohol is the most accessible viable

1222
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:51,560
form of glucose I want to make some

1223
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:54,500
drinks you guys

1224
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:56,640
just blows my mind the information

1225
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:59,400
I can't even tell you so we're making

1226
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:02,040
the brain detox challenge so that's

1227
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:04,079
actually next not challenge brain detox

let's get going

1243
00:47:35,339 --> 00:47:38,760
so

1244
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:41,460
that's right here

1245
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:43,680
so in this one we're going to take some

1246
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:45,240
coconut water and I'm gonna put it in

1247
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:47,780
here so we're looking at two cups of

1248
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:47,780
coconut water

1249
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:57,300
starts with two cups of coconut water

1250
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:59,220
right

1251
00:47:57,300 --> 00:48:00,660
and then we're going to start adding the

1252
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:03,859
rest of the stuff in it let's put some

1253
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:03,859
spirulina in here

1254
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:10,680
one teaspoon of spirulina

1255
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:13,140
let's get the teaspoon out

1256
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:15,599
a little bit

1257
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:16,680
okay one teaspoon of barley grass juice

1258
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:19,020

you guys probably know why because I've

1263
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:30,300
talked about it before

1264
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:32,700
for the grass juice powder a teaspoon of

1265
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:36,140
that goes in there as well now two

1266
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:36,140
teaspoons of wild blueberry juice

1267
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:40,339
let's crack it open

1268
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:44,660
I like I'll measure it

1269
00:48:44,819 --> 00:48:47,720
there's one

1270
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:50,599

balm in there I'll make that and then

1281
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:22,260

1298
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:07,160
people to have this in their life

1299
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:07,160
because it's that incredible

1300
00:50:07,859 --> 00:50:13,400
this was simple to make

1301
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:13,400
powerful tonic

1302
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:18,680
how easy was that one right there

1303
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:23,720
that's the that's a drink I make when

1304
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,720
family comes over

1305
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:28,440
and everybody's everybody's doing the

1306
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:31,020
brain detox Sonic

1307
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:34,079
okay so here's the thing drink this and

1308
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:37,440
15 minutes later do a chaser the Chaser

1309
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:39,359
is eight ounces more of coconut water so

1310
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:41,400
just letting you know

1311
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:44,819
I got a chaser right here some coconut

1312
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:47,520

1313
00:50:44,819 --> 00:50:49,980
so you don't you know you don't drink

1314
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:51,839
this all in one shot it's whenever you

1315
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:53,700
finish this

1316
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:55,980
15 minutes later

1317
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:58,140
you do an eight ounce coconut water

1318
00:50:55,980 --> 00:51:00,240
chaser

1319
00:50:58,140 --> 00:51:03,420
there's a reason for it Spirit of

1320
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:04,800
compassion with how it works and how it

1321
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:07,440
works in the bloodstream and the body

1322
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:10,980
this is a different form a way to do it

1323
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:14,960
it's a brain detox tonic so you don't

1324
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:14,960
have to send this all down in one shot

1325
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:21,240

1326
00:51:18,599 --> 00:51:24,420

way

1330
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:33,180
15 minutes later you want to do the

1331
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:35,760
eight ounce Chaser which is just eight

1332
00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:38,460

00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:11,460
cardamon

1363
00:53:08,819 --> 00:53:13,020

1365
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:16,680

1367
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:21,180

1368
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:23,880
close-up too that's awesome Yep

1369
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:26,280
see these are whole cardamoms right here

1370
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:28,440
check it out those are strong by the way

1371
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:30,359
they're really strong I put three right

1372
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:33,000
in there because believe it or not

1373
00:53:30,359 --> 00:53:36,260
it's got a kick to it

1374
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,260
one star anise

1375
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:40,319
so there we go

1376
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:43,140
there's the spiders these are the

1377
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:46,140
dehydrated spiders right

1378
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:49,079
they got a kick that's going in and

1379
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:52,819
let's see four or five cloves

1380
00:53:49,079 --> 00:53:52,819
ah we got some cloves right here

1381
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:56,839
four or five of them is good

1382
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:05,119
boom

1383
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:05,119
half inch piece of Ginger let's actually

1384
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:09,020
get a paring knife out really quick

1385
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:14,640
you can peel it

1386
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:16,920
if you don't want to peel it you don't

1387
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:19,859
have to if you don't want to I like to

1388
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:21,300
peel it thinly slice it

1389
00:54:19,859 --> 00:54:23,280
one of the reasons why you want to peel

1390
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:24,780
it too is just you know because if you

1391
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:26,460
have company over and everything and

1392
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:28,500
someone gets a peel in their mouth and

1393
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:30,000
they're just like I mean some some of

1394
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:31,680
the ginger skin in their mouth that's

1395
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,599
not as fun

1396
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:34,859
I've seen that happen so I was like all

1397
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:36,480
right all right let me just peel this

1398
00:54:34,859 --> 00:54:39,619
back

1399
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:39,619
thinly slice it

1400
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:42,859
there we go

1401
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:54,900
that's going in see these pieces you

1402
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:57,559
guys

1403
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:57,559
incredible

1404
00:54:57,720 --> 00:55:00,900
simmer for 10 to 15 minutes let it get

1405
00:54:59,819 --> 00:55:01,800
simmering for a little bit I'm gonna

1406
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:04,500
move

1407
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:07,220
some of this around

1408
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:07,220
nice

1409
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:15,599
all right so we're gonna make a wild

1410
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:17,339
blueberry orange sangria if you guys

1411
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:19,020
just got here this is day one of the

1412
00:55:17,339 --> 00:55:21,059
medical medium wild blueberry drinks

1413
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:22,380
challenge

1414
00:55:21,059 --> 00:55:25,700
okay

1415
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:25,700
so we're gonna make the sangria

1416
00:55:31,319 --> 00:55:38,900
looking around for Stuff

1417
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:38,900
we're going to need this too

1418
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:45,359
all right I love drinks

1419
00:55:43,619 --> 00:55:47,280
so I got the picture right here so I'm

1420
00:55:45,359 --> 00:55:48,960
going to use this so I'm actually going

1421
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:50,700
to start out with making simple let's

1422
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:52,619
let's just start by putting in three

1423
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:54,300
cups of wild blueberry juice in there

1424
00:55:52,619 --> 00:55:57,420
actually I'll hold off for that for the

1425
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:59,520
moment let me start with

1426
00:55:57,420 --> 00:56:00,380
no no I'll do that I think it's a good

1427
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:04,579
idea

1428
00:56:00,380 --> 00:56:04,579
all right so we're gonna do three cups

1429
00:56:05,819 --> 00:56:10,400
you guys we're making these fast this is

1430
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:10,400
like insane

1431
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:15,380
like seriously we're making them pretty

1432
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:15,380
quick right or

1433
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:20,119
three cups right there

1434
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:24,440
nice

1435
00:56:31,079 --> 00:56:34,280
I still need a shot

1436
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:39,440
you guys don't mind right

1437
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:45,740
bartender give me another

1438
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:48,500
all right

1439
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:55,740
if there's a feeling you get it's

1440
00:56:54,180 --> 00:56:57,859
different than like with alcohol

1441
00:56:55,740 --> 00:57:00,359
poisoning right or alcoholic beverage

1442
00:56:57,859 --> 00:57:01,920
beverages right the more I slurring my

1443
00:57:00,359 --> 00:57:03,660
speech because I'm getting glucose to

1444
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:04,800
the brain instead no it doesn't work

1445
00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:07,079
that way I'm not learning my speech

1446
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:09,540
here's how it works

1447
00:57:07,079 --> 00:57:12,119
when you get like real glucose like a

1448
00:57:09,540 --> 00:57:13,859
high quality glucose something like this

1449
00:57:12,119 --> 00:57:16,380
to the brain that has all that

1450
00:57:13,859 --> 00:57:17,819
anthocyanin in it it's an entirely

1451
00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:19,559
different experience

1452
00:57:17,819 --> 00:57:21,900
and it's it's incredible you know a

1453
00:57:19,559 --> 00:57:24,780
friend of mine who drank his whole life

1454
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:26,099
I finally got him to quit right doesn't

1455
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:28,920
drink anymore he's doing the wild

1456
00:57:26,099 --> 00:57:31,740
blueberry juice and he says it's like he

1457
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:33,839
feels an entirely different Rush

1458
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:35,400
but he you know he does it that he gets

1459
00:57:33,839 --> 00:57:37,140
on his treadmill and he's running on his

1460
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:38,760
treadmill he's running on the wild

1461
00:57:37,140 --> 00:57:40,140
blueberry juice the wild blueberry juice

1462
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:42,420
is getting to the brain the glucose the

1463
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:43,920
whole bit I tell him it's anthocyanins

1464
00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:45,240
that are actually in the glucose from

1465
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:46,680
the wobble regions that are getting to

1466
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:48,720
the brain it's a really incredible

1467
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:51,540
feeling all right let's go

1468
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:53,099
all right I'm going to pour this in here

1469
00:57:51,540 --> 00:57:56,059
if you guys don't mind

1470
00:57:53,099 --> 00:57:56,059
just made a mess

1471
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:59,119
but that's okay

1472
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:07,619
AWS Bar and Grill gets a little messy

1473
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:10,740
you guys we are not closing down AWS Bar

1474
00:58:07,619 --> 00:58:12,780
and Grill no way

1475
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:14,579
only spilled a little bit

1476
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:16,800
that's why I like the whole live thing

1477
00:58:14,579 --> 00:58:18,780
too because it's like

1478
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:21,480
I don't know I don't like all that

1479
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:23,040
pre-recorded stuff where they edit out

1480
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:24,540
everything because they want the person

1481
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:26,160
to look perfect they want everything to

1482
00:58:24,540 --> 00:58:27,960
be perfect I don't like that I think

1483
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:28,740
there's something wrong with that all

1484
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:30,300
right

1485
00:58:28,740 --> 00:58:33,599
now I'm going to start doing some

1486
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:34,500
oranges I want to actually

1487
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:36,059
um

1488
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:38,819
we're gonna get some orange juice going

1489
00:58:36,059 --> 00:58:41,040
here so what I'm gonna do is squeeze

1490
00:58:38,819 --> 00:58:42,599
a bunch of oranges here so just give me

1491
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:44,160
a sec

1492
00:58:42,599 --> 00:58:46,440
I want two and a half cups of orange

1493
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:49,700
juice that's what I want so I'm going to

1494
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:49,700
slice a whole bunch of oranges

1495
00:58:49,799 --> 00:58:52,799
if you guys don't mind

1496
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:55,079
right

1497
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:57,599
I'm gonna hand squeeze them you can use

1498
00:58:55,079 --> 00:58:59,460
uh you know citrus juicer if you want

1499
00:58:57,599 --> 00:59:01,980
I'm going to do just a little bit of

1500
00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:05,540
squeezing this way

1501
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:05,540
I'm going to cut a few oranges

1502
00:59:07,260 --> 00:59:10,859
you guys don't mind

1503
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:12,720
you know when I think about that

1504
00:59:10,859 --> 00:59:14,040
information about what alcohol does to

1505
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:16,380
the brain

1506
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:19,819
and it's starving the brain to death so

1507
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:19,819
that when you actually have

1508
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:26,640
when you actually have symptoms I call

1509
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:29,220
them symptoms when someone's feeling

1510
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:31,140
Tipsy it's a symptom it's not just

1511
00:59:29,220 --> 00:59:33,660
because it's a fun thing and it's

1512
00:59:31,140 --> 00:59:35,640
alcohol sure it might feel fun but it's

1513
00:59:33,660 --> 00:59:37,380
a starting of a symptom because their

1514
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:40,020
brain is being starved to death when you

1515
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:42,619
think about that it's incredible really

1516
00:59:40,020 --> 00:59:42,619
I mean

1517
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:52,440
nothing is

1518
00:59:49,740 --> 00:59:55,020
seems which is

1519
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:59,240
prime example of that how come research

1520
00:59:55,020 --> 00:59:59,240
in science doesn't know right

1521
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:04,140
that these are actually symptoms because

1522
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:05,880
the brain is starving

1523
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:08,839
how come like they don't know that when

1524
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:08,839
you think about that

1525
01:00:11,099 --> 01:00:15,480
I mean another Century can go by and

1526
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:18,720
they'll never know what happens when

1527
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:20,720
alcohol is go you know is is actually

1528
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:20,720
um

1529
01:00:21,359 --> 01:00:26,160
what alcohol is doing in the brain and

1530
01:00:23,940 --> 01:00:28,079
the Damage that's being done another

1531
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:29,760
Century could go by and they still won't

1532
01:00:28,079 --> 01:00:31,619
know

1533
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:33,540
so I was like having this Advanced

1534
01:00:31,619 --> 01:00:35,880
information I like knowing all this

1535
01:00:33,540 --> 01:00:38,040
stuff if someone says well I don't drink

1536
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:40,680
that's not really important to me that

1537
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:42,180
piece of information aw because I don't

1538
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:43,980
drink anything well then get other

1539
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:45,960
important pieces of information from the

1540
01:00:43,980 --> 01:00:48,680
medical medium book series

1541
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:51,359
get all the the anti-viral information

1542
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:52,980
get the symptoms and conditions and the

1543
01:00:51,359 --> 01:00:54,780
causes information

1544
01:00:52,980 --> 01:00:56,940
get the different get the like

1545
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:59,400
information on like how to get medals

1546
01:00:56,940 --> 01:01:01,079
out how to protect yourself get all that

1547
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:03,660
information that's in there

1548
01:01:01,079 --> 01:01:05,760
if alcohol is not like your important

1549
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:07,440
thing because you don't drink or you

1550
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:11,059
don't care think about all the other

1551
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:11,059
information that's in the books

1552
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:20,520
so I mean that's important to know

1553
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:22,020
Brenda says they call it sedating but

1554
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:24,000
don't make the connection with the

1555
01:01:22,020 --> 01:01:26,720
glucose

1556
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,720
foreign

1557
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:36,799
they still don't know why it's sedating

1558
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:41,839
they don't make the connection with any

1559
01:01:39,540 --> 01:01:41,839
of it

1560
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:46,319
and they don't know that the brain is

1561
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:47,940
actually being injured

1562
01:01:46,319 --> 01:01:50,160
they just observe things they don't

1563
01:01:47,940 --> 01:01:51,599
actually see inside they don't know

1564
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:53,460
what's happening inside your bloodstream

1565
01:01:51,599 --> 01:01:55,200
in your brain they're sitting there

1566
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:57,299
observing someone's reaction as they

1567
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:58,680
drink alcohol like anybody can do that a

1568
01:01:57,299 --> 01:02:01,819
five-year-old can do that does that make

1569
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:01,819
the five-year-old scientist

1570
01:02:02,940 --> 01:02:07,980
think about that right

1571
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:09,900
I mean when you think like a

1572
01:02:07,980 --> 01:02:12,540
five-year-old can observe

1573
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:14,880
a parent drinking

1574
01:02:12,540 --> 01:02:17,280
right

1575
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:19,619
think about that for a second and still

1576
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:22,680
have the same observation

1577
01:02:19,619 --> 01:02:25,380
as a 40 year old scientist

1578
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:28,140
observing someone who's drinking

1579
01:02:25,380 --> 01:02:32,180
think about that one right there

1580
01:02:28,140 --> 01:02:32,180
is that five-year-old now a scientist

1581
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:38,280
foreign

1582
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:39,720
because they're still not going to know

1583
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:42,000
what happens in your brain when you're

1584
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:44,160
actually consuming alcohol if you guys

1585
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:46,559
if you guys are doing like

1586
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:50,400
keep in mind when you like see things

1587
01:02:46,559 --> 01:02:53,160
like the lemon balm I put in right

1588
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:56,640
in the drink and stuff and all that keep

1589
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:59,339
in mind you don't want alcohol in your

1590
01:02:56,640 --> 01:03:02,280
tinctures it's something I see every day

1591
01:02:59,339 --> 01:03:05,099
someone would be like I I I've done this

1592
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:07,380
protocol from this guy or I've done this

1593
01:03:05,099 --> 01:03:10,559
this method or this you know protocol

1594
01:03:07,380 --> 01:03:11,700
and there's alcohol in all of the herbal

1595
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:15,480
tinctures

1596
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:20,000
and it just proves that alone is such a

1597
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:20,000
huge mistake it's incredible

1598
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:25,140
you guys I know I'm I'm wasting juice

1599
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:26,579
out of some of these right here what

1600
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:27,480
we're trying to do you know what

1601
01:03:26,579 --> 01:03:30,119
happened

1602
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:32,760
these aren't juicy do you ever have an

1603
01:03:30,119 --> 01:03:34,859
orange that's actually not juicy so I'm

1604
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:36,960
actually squeezing

1605
01:03:34,859 --> 01:03:40,520
like the heck out of these more so than

1606
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:40,520
normal which is actually really funny

1607
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:47,059
foreign

1608
01:03:47,299 --> 01:03:52,619
you can actually really squeeze like a

1609
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:55,619
lot of juice out of it really easy

1610
01:03:52,619 --> 01:03:58,319
yeah Envy Doom says oh no not juicy yeah

1611
01:03:55,619 --> 01:04:00,420
that's your Bane

1612
01:03:58,319 --> 01:04:03,380
so you you actually experience that not

1613
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:03,380
juicy oranges

1614
01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:09,260
yeah I know sometimes oranges are dry

1615
01:04:06,299 --> 01:04:09,260
you know totally

1616
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:13,280
all right

1617
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:19,799
we're gonna do obviously some more so

1618
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:23,780
hang on you guys

1619
01:04:19,799 --> 01:04:23,780
driest set of oranges

1620
01:04:27,540 --> 01:04:31,260
yeah but that's okay because you know

1621
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:33,980
because I got this drink right now

1622
01:04:31,260 --> 01:04:33,980
that's heating up

1623
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:37,700
it's getting warm so that's cool

1624
01:04:44,099 --> 01:04:49,200
all right there we go now we're cranking

1625
01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:52,500
out the juice

1626
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:55,020
I I squeeze my hand for a reason because

1627
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:57,299
I when I do it for myself and everything

1628
01:04:55,020 --> 01:04:59,400
the reason why I like to squeeze by hand

1629
01:04:57,299 --> 01:05:01,440
is because it's the connection to the

1630
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:03,960
food it's connection to the fruit on the

1631
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:05,579
tree it's all of that it's connecting to

1632
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:07,799
the food that's going to enter into my

1633
01:05:05,579 --> 01:05:09,180
body so there's I don't talk about it

1634
01:05:07,799 --> 01:05:10,859
much but there's all these spiritual

1635
01:05:09,180 --> 01:05:13,140
connections that I actually have with

1636
01:05:10,859 --> 01:05:15,420
the food and I talk about a little bit

1637
01:05:13,140 --> 01:05:17,579
of that in life-changing Foods right if

1638
01:05:15,420 --> 01:05:18,720
you've ever had that book or or read

1639
01:05:17,579 --> 01:05:21,119
that book

1640
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:24,680
there's always these spiritual

1641
01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:24,680
connections with our food

1642
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:31,319
and I never have time to talk about that

1643
01:05:29,339 --> 01:05:33,240
I never have time to go into that or

1644
01:05:31,319 --> 01:05:36,240
into a lot of details of that because

1645
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:38,099
I'm really busy making sure that

1646
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:40,200
everybody has the information they need

1647
01:05:38,099 --> 01:05:42,240
to get out of chronic illness and then

1648
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:44,339
the spiritual stuff is you know is is

1649
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:45,599
fun about food for sure the connections

1650
01:05:44,339 --> 01:05:47,760
and everything and we can talk about

1651
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:49,980
that but there's a lot of people

1652
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:53,280
suffering

1653
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:56,460
they're in so much body pain physically

1654
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:58,020
they're suffering mentally

1655
01:05:56,460 --> 01:06:00,359
and I just try to get out that

1656
01:05:58,020 --> 01:06:02,280
information because I want to save lives

1657
01:06:00,359 --> 01:06:04,619
I want people to heal I want their lives

1658
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:05,880
to be saved right it's a lot of juice

1659
01:06:04,619 --> 01:06:08,460

two to three tablespoons of maple syrup

1695
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:39,319
I was just doing maple syrup today but

1696
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:41,580
there's nothing wrong with honey

1697
01:08:39,319 --> 01:08:43,980
absolutely that's a great way to do it I

1698
01:08:41,580 --> 01:08:45,480
do it all the time with honey so that

1699
01:08:43,980 --> 01:08:47,160
works

1700
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:48,359

1701
01:08:47,160 --> 01:08:50,219

1704
01:08:53,100 --> 01:08:58,219

1713
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:45,179

1714
01:09:43,199 --> 01:09:48,259

1755
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:07,400

enjoying the flavor

1780
01:13:27,780 --> 01:13:31,320
it's about what you're doing for

1781
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:33,780
yourself

1782
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:34,980
that's the whole point so good for the

1783
01:13:33,780 --> 01:13:37,560
