14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,520
little bit about me you guys know

15
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:35,219
already start at the celery juice

16
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,780
movement global the originator of the

17
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:38,460
celery juice movement right you guys

18
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:41,660
know that and we're drinking celery

19
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:44,460
juices right now so it's really fun so I

20
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:46,530
had them on and really lucky like this

21
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:48,360
is really a lucky day it's more than a

22
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:50,430
lucky day an incredible day because

23
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:53,430
these are the best dentists I've ever

24
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:55,140
known out there in the world and and I

25
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:56,730
know this for a fact because if they

26
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,829
know the knowledge they know the

27
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:02,010
information they're they're experts

28
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:03,840
extracting mercury fillings and there

29
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:05,970
are experts in general about teeth all

30
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,159
the different things that dentists don't

31
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:09,780
know about they know and that's what

32
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,670
happens just because your dentist

33
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:15,360
doesn't mean you know a lot about teeth

34
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:18,000
I mean is that true I mean like that's a

35
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,520
really important factor out there if you

36
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,900
look them up and and you'll you'll find

37
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,570

everybody who's vegans believe the

60
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:14,970
minute they get a tooth problem

61
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:17,760
it's blamed on their diet and how that's

62
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:19,739
a misconception so if your plant-based

63
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,000
or big supporters of you

64
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:22,620
you know we're supporters of everybody

65
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,580
whether they need animal protein or not

66
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:26,430
or whatever we're supporters of

67
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:27,780
everybody but we're big supporters of if

68
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:29,790
you're a plant-based person and you're

69
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:32,160
scared and running because you've got a

70
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:34,290
cavity and you think maybe it's your

71
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,690
diet we're going to talk about how that

72
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:37,709
works why that happens so hey thank you

73
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:39,540
for coming you guys

74
00:02:37,709 --> 00:02:41,280
thank you for having I'm even clapping

75
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,819
today because this is really cool thank

76
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,489
you

77
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:47,250
this is really cool so so basically

78
00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:48,330
let's talk about let's talk about that

79
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,100
whole thing with the plant-based

80
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:52,799
movement right off the run um because

81
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:55,860
that's a big deal because I always say

82
00:02:52,799 --> 00:02:58,349
that when somebody on a plant-based diet

83
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:00,269
gets the first symptom say it's not even

84
00:02:58,349 --> 00:03:02,580
dental but they get the first symptom

85
00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:04,709
they get scared they think I don't have

86
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:06,330
protein somebody tells me you got to go

87
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:08,190
back to animal products and they start

88
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:10,920
freaking out and they drop everything

89
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:13,590
and they just go running out of fear and

90
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:16,769
everything so and I always say that that

91
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:18,690
you know it's sad because so what does

92
00:03:16,769 --> 00:03:21,359
that mean no one with a paleo diet ever

93
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:23,519
had a symptom nobody with an a really

94
00:03:21,359 --> 00:03:26,370
high quality keto diet nobody with you

95
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,590
know however had symptom so where do

96
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:30,900
they run and they don't run in hide I

97
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:33,329
noticed they don't meaning because their

98
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:34,829
diets never blamed their diets never

99
00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:36,660
blames if you're on the keto diet a

100
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:39,359
healthy keto diet or a new name-brand

101
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:41,280
keto diet high-fat diet you're you know

102
00:03:39,359 --> 00:03:43,620
when you get your first cavity or you

103
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,450
get your first symptom it's never going

104
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,980
to be blamed on that keto diet it's

105
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:48,569
never gonna be blamed on that high

106
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:50,579
protein diet the minute your plant-based

107
00:03:48,569 --> 00:03:52,859
though the minute you're there and

108
00:03:50,579 --> 00:03:54,750
damned if you just your your whole your

109
00:03:52,859 --> 00:03:57,510
whole days ruined your life is just your

110
00:03:54,750 --> 00:04:00,299
your your shifting your gears and all

111
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:02,250
that it's really sad because you know

112
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:03,510
what I've seen all these years and I'm

113
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:06,540
talking about three and a half decades

114
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:08,639
of this you know is that it has nothing

115
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:10,260
to do with the fact that your

116
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:12,870
plant-based that you got a cavity

117
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:15,630
occurring and we're gonna cover like all

118
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:18,209
that and in in that whole area and stuff

119
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:18,959
of what happens there and then the root

120
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:21,090
canals we're going to

121
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,919
about that a little later too and so you

122
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:25,380
guys see this you hear about this though

123
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:28,289
when people are plant-based right yes I

124
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:30,330
mean when I was in dental school you

125
00:04:28,289 --> 00:04:31,740
know people who were vegan who ate a lot

126
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:33,810
of sugar a lot of fruit it was always

127
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:35,699
that you know it's because of their diet

128
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:37,440
this and that but I've been out of

129
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:39,680
dental school for a while and I see it

130
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:43,080
in practice it has nothing to do with

131
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:45,300
sugar it has to do with your digestive

132
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:47,490
how you're digesting food things that

133
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:49,259
are coming back up things that you know

134
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:51,150
we speak about so it's definitely not

135
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:52,020
definitely not the vegan or the

136
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:53,940
plant-based diet

137
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:55,979
yeah which leads me to this thing which

138
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:58,530
you know I think I talked about this you

139
00:04:55,979 --> 00:05:01,139
guys know this but our teeth are time

140
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:02,849
capsules and I mean you're like the only

141
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:06,030
dentist out there that truly know that

142
00:05:02,849 --> 00:05:08,340
that time capsules means it's not what

143
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:10,380
you're doing even in the moment of why

144
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:12,990
you have a problem with your gums your

145
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:14,669
teeth your jaw you know it's what

146
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:16,590
happened in the past what were you

147
00:05:14,669 --> 00:05:18,060
eating 20 years ago what were you doing

148
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:20,639
15 years ago what kind of stress were

149
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:24,360
you under did you have acid reflux for

150
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:25,800
ten years roading the gums and acid

151
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:29,340
reflux is one of the biggest thing you

152
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:31,800
guys we see all the time people with

153
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:33,780
digestive issues have acid coming up

154
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,139
when they're sleeping and just washing

155
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:38,820
away the enamel destroying the teeth

156
00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:40,500
digestive issues for us equals teeth

157
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:43,409
problems and it's actually the hardest

158
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:46,199
to treat because anything you put on the

159
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:50,699
teeth if you're not fixing your GI it's

160
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:52,259
just yeah and then when you're laying -

161
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:54,960
you're laying down at night you're

162
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:56,370
sleeping everything creeps up so it

163
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,590
creeps up the canal you know there's

164
00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:00,810
something that I always say is ammonia

165
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:03,810
permeability and and it's rotting

166
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:05,250
protein it's rotting fats in the linings

167
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:06,719
of the testicle track they're sitting on

168
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:08,789
the linings of the testing on track and

169
00:06:06,719 --> 00:06:10,590
it's sitting there and it's putrifying

170
00:06:08,789 --> 00:06:12,389
and you got a you know got all these

171
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:14,400
microorganisms feeding off that it's

172
00:06:12,389 --> 00:06:16,860
putrifying and what you get you get

173
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,840
these ammonia gasses that creep up and

174
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:21,210
they're just getting into the mouth you

175
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,620
know the whole halitosis thing which I

176
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:24,659
didn't even talk to you guys know right

177
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:26,789
the whole halitosis things down breath

178
00:06:24,659 --> 00:06:28,710
right and and people think it's because

179
00:06:26,789 --> 00:06:29,400
of the mouth they think it's all because

180
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:32,010
of the mouth

181
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:34,320
it's the gut it's the good lives in the

182
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:36,510
gut it's all that ammonia coming up and

183
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:38,340
so and then you got the acid reflux

184
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:40,290
you've got the assets coming up to of

185
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:43,590
roading the gums starting to take out

186
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:45,120
the gums and you know in the thing is

187
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:46,949
it's one of the reasons why I say you

188
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,389
got to do your celery juice you have to

189
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:50,070
do your celery juice so you start your

190
00:06:48,389 --> 00:06:52,199
celery juice now it's going to help you

191
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:54,570
later on because you're restoring your

192
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:57,419
hydrochloric acid when you restore your

193
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:59,910
hydrochloric acid you lose that acid

194
00:06:57,419 --> 00:07:03,300
reflux because you know acid reflux

195
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:06,600
they're bad acids produced by

196
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:09,030
microorganisms and bad bacteria that are

197
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:12,840
in the liver better'n anywhere in the

198
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:15,210
gut and that's what's coming up the

199
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:17,580
celery juice three months three months

200
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:18,960
in how the doses will be gone you guys

201
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:21,750
will see the difference right away

202
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:23,760
you'll be it'll be incredible okay and

203
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:26,669
you'll see it and talk to your friends

204
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:28,440
they'll tell you you have no bad smell

205
00:07:26,669 --> 00:07:34,110
coming out because we see it all the

206
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:35,940
time if you're not if you have that

207
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:38,430
ammonia coming up it's bringing the pH

208
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:40,860
down yeah when you bring a pH down you

209
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:42,930
allow bacteria to kind of grow and

210
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:45,570
that's you know you have to kind of get

211
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:47,910
the GI to a better position and deliver

212
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:56,700
to a better position in order to to kind

213
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:57,990
of lemon water yes so that's important

214
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:00,990
to you the lemon water

215
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:02,760
you know lemon water originally was all

216
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:04,740
about you know you put lemon in water to

217
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:07,289
make lemonade you make a tasty drink you

218
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:09,150
have lemon squeeze in water and and it

219
00:08:07,289 --> 00:08:10,740
was hydrating that's the kind of

220
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:12,419
consensus that was years ago and then

221
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:14,610
what happened was spirit of compassion

222
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:15,990
new medical medium information they told

223
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:18,720
me at the lemon water when I was younger

224
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:20,789
flushed out the liver so it flushed out

225
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,830
the liver and it flushed out the toxins

226
00:08:20,789 --> 00:08:24,570
and someone said to me recently said you

227
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:25,860
didn't start lemon water like oh no

228
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:28,349
people been putting lemon in the water

229
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:30,870
for centuries yeah I didn't start any

230
00:08:28,349 --> 00:08:32,849
lemon water thing but what spirit didn't

231
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:34,919
do spirit of compassion didn't do was

232
00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:36,750
teach people the lemon water for the

233
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:39,300
first time taught people had flushed out

234
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:41,560
the liver and flushed the liver out of

235
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:43,000
all those toxins that waited there to be

236
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:44,740
first thing in the morning because your

237
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,410
livers working all night long it's got

238
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:49,330
people you got people with all these

239
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:51,070
toxins building up all night long we got

240
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:52,930
a stagnant sluggish liver they're

241
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:54,820
getting the acid reflux they're getting

242
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:57,010
ammonia coming up from rotting peat

243
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:58,990
refined proteins and fats in their gut

244
00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:00,970
and it's it's Glee Qing in their mouth

245
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:02,830
it's coming up they're burning out their

246
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:04,480
gums because of it

247
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:06,160
you see it every day every day and then

248
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,260
what happens is all those toxins build

249
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:10,900
up if you do that lemon water every

250
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:12,490
morning and you flush out the liver and

251
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:14,529
you flush out those toxins from the

252
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:16,360
liver you sweep that out and it's gonna

253
00:09:14,529 --> 00:09:18,790
help you get there you know closer then

254
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:21,490
you bring in your celery juice which is

255
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:23,920
a big one too and I want to ask you guys

256
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:25,870
about mineral deficiencies like what do

257
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,740
you think about that like what do you

258
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:29,380
think about the whole mineral

259
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:31,120
deficiencies you know our teeth are made

260
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:33,160
of minerals we you know the whole bit

261
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:36,370
like like what you were saying basically

262
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:38,200
people could be on a specific diet 5 7

263
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:40,390
10 years and everything is great and

264
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:42,520
then they switch to diet that they now

265
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:43,720
believe was better and all of a sudden

266
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:45,130
they're like oh my teeth are falling

267
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,230
apart they have all these cavities I

268
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:48,190
have gum disease I have all this

269
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:50,190
happening to me

270
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:52,630
I gotta drop this new diet right away

271
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:54,940
because when I was doing the other diet

272
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:56,530
nothing was happening no it takes time

273
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:58,930
for the mineral silly child

274
00:09:56,530 --> 00:10:02,800
it takes time for things to break down

275
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:04,839
teeth are such a complex tissue it

276
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,690
actually is said that it's the longest

277
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:09,339
to be made in utero when our moms are

278
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:12,130
pregnant with us did she take the

279
00:10:09,339 --> 00:10:15,190
longest to form it takes a long time to

280
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:17,170
break them down so it's as empty I'm

281
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:20,500
saying it's a time capsule it will catch

282
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:22,240
up with you but later so don't see it

283
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,680
like in the moment what you're doing is

284
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,839
what's causing the problem it's what

285
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,250
you've done in the past yeah see people

286
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:30,520
people come into this world to begin

287
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:33,070
with mineral deficient okay because how

288
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:36,190
was mom eating how was dad eating right

289
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:38,230
and then they have emails yeah you know

290
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:40,420
I've always found that the metals and

291
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:43,180
I'm not just the the mercury fillings

292
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:45,610
those metals not just that the metals

293
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:47,920
that we come into this world with and

294
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:49,680
then we collect through certain ways you

295
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,970
guys can use your imagination

296
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,730
and you can get Nettles I talked about

297
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:55,740
it there's there's you know metals and

298
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:57,360
pharmaceuticals there's metals and other

299
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:59,309
places there's all kinds of stuff like

300
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,290
that but we can get metals and its

301
00:10:59,309 --> 00:11:03,660
antibiotics have metals in them you know

302
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:05,579
I talk about that all the time so you

303
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,869
know when we have when we when we

304
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:08,939
receive all these we build all these

305
00:11:06,869 --> 00:11:11,670
metals in her life I always find that

306
00:11:08,939 --> 00:11:13,860
that breaks down the mouths immune

307
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:15,209
system and not even the metals being in

308
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:17,759
the mouth just through the body

309
00:11:15,209 --> 00:11:19,259
lymphatic system our immune system

310
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:20,939
starts to break down from having high

311
00:11:19,259 --> 00:11:23,519
amounts of metals in our liver and other

312
00:11:20,939 --> 00:11:26,069
places in the body but when we have

313
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,990
these elevated metals it weakens teeth

314
00:11:26,069 --> 00:11:30,059
and weakens teeths ability to stay

315
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:33,240
strong you know to keep the mineral

316
00:11:30,059 --> 00:11:35,970
strong because metals basically cancel

317
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:37,920
out minerals in us minerals get affected

318
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:41,069
because water minerals there trace

319
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,929
metals but good ones minerals are trace

320
00:11:41,069 --> 00:11:44,999
metals but good ones so you got all this

321
00:11:42,929 --> 00:11:46,920
mercury you got all this aluminum you

322
00:11:44,999 --> 00:11:51,269
got all these other toxic metals in us

323
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:54,540
and they react to our own trace minerals

324
00:11:51,269 --> 00:11:56,730
we trace metals metals and and then

325
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:59,730
those trace those trace minerals are

326
00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:01,290
actually part of our teeth and then and

327
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:02,790
then we get the mercury fillings when we

328
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:05,309
have you know and all that but we can go

329
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:07,889
in a little bit but the bottom line is

330
00:12:05,309 --> 00:12:09,600
it's a time capsule to how a mineral

331
00:12:07,889 --> 00:12:19,110
deficient you were when you were younger

332
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:20,759
exactly and your parents to when you

333
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:23,639
guys are pregnant you're making another

334
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:25,679
skeletal system a lot of minerals are

335
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:28,800
getting pulled to make that system so it

336
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:30,779
can kind of steal from your system so

337
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:34,139
something will suffer yeah your baby's

338
00:12:30,779 --> 00:12:36,569
teeth or bones whatever more your bones

339
00:12:34,139 --> 00:12:38,100
and teeth so eat some fruit when you're

340
00:12:36,569 --> 00:12:39,990
pregnant yeah you know I don't see I

341
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:41,370
don't see dentist saying this out there

342
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:42,839
and it's really sad to me because

343
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:45,360
they're they're out of touch because

344
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:48,720
this is really powerful information you

345
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,639
know because it's it's not just about in

346
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,040
the moment because then just think right

347
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:55,259
in the moment what you're doing that's

348
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,029
what they always go after so if you go

349
00:12:55,259 --> 00:12:58,829
to a dentist and you're plant-based and

350
00:12:57,029 --> 00:13:01,379
you you're going there and they spot a

351
00:12:58,829 --> 00:13:01,800
cavity oh you got to stop that plant

352
00:13:01,379 --> 00:13:04,290
babe

353
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:06,330
right away you got to stop it right away

354
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:07,830
that's what they'll say and they'll be

355
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:09,360
like you you're obviously protein

356
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:12,480
deficient you're getting too much sugar

357
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:14,580
and but sugar isn't the cost that's the

358
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:17,820
whole thing and I want to I want to dive

359
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:19,830
into that a little bit so you're told at

360
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:23,100
the dentist office that sugar in general

361
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:25,440
like candy sugar like all that kind of

362
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:27,510
sugar is the problem with teeth problems

363
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,970
and then the other thing you're told is

364
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:31,950
citrus so I want to cover that a second

365
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:33,300
students of citrus so these are the two

366
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:34,980
things you'll get it that the D you'll

367
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:38,310
get at the dentist's office is yeah

368
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:40,950
you'll get the candy bad sugars fruit

369
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:42,660
sugar the lump it all together we don't

370
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:44,490
want to be on bad sugars you don't want

371
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:45,570
to be uncanny you guys we know that I

372
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,010
mean if you're dealing with a chronic

373
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:49,380
illness or anything you don't want to be

374
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:51,150
eating candy but fruit sugars an

375
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:53,190
entirely different thing you know that's

376
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:54,900
a whole nother a whole nother game it

377
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:57,690
creates glucose in the body it feeds

378
00:13:54,900 --> 00:14:00,510
every cell but the bottom line is that

379
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:03,090
was a theory going all the way back then

380
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:05,100
sugar caused teeth problems because you

381
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:11,760
guys seen people eat sugar their whole

382
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:14,550
like bad sugar no problem no property I

383
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:16,770
mean we always tell our patients eat the

384
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:18,720
fruit sugar yeah the fruit is great for

385
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:22,530
you it's good for your teeth it's good

386
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,880
for your body you will not enroll your

387
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:26,370
teeth with sucking and lemons or oranges

388
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,960
is that there is no amount of water

389
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:29,280
ingest you can suck on to destroy your

390
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,990
teeth this just doesn't happen you know

391
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,700
there's fake truth out there and then

392
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:33,930
there's real truth out there that's how

393
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:35,580
the world works you know you mean

394
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:37,290
there's theories that create a fake

395
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:39,750
truth and then everybody runs around

396
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:41,070
with it and then you got real truth

397
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:43,200
right here and I paid dearly for

398
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:45,510
bringing real truth out you guys know

399
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:47,610
that I can't last you know kicked a lot

400
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:49,050
you you know the whole deal out there

401
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:50,910
but when you're bringing a real truth to

402
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:53,250
people so they actually stop feeding the

403
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:55,440
medical system so they start healing

404
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:58,320
that's powerful you know it's funny

405
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:01,160
real truth is real truth right here is

406
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:03,810
exactly that that we've seen I've seen

407
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:06,540
years and years of years and years you

408
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:09,960
have helped out over 250,000 individuals

409
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:13,020
like one on one over the last 35 years

410
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:13,950
look what many years ago and I've seen

411
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:18,360
people the

412
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:20,010
and E junk cakes sugar sugar cubes and

413
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:23,460
their teeth be fine

414
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:25,470
clearly you did sugar cubes oh I'll have

415
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:27,780
four more sugar cubes here and sucking

416
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:30,180
on sugar kids I've known people who

417
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:31,620
sucked on sugars that's a big yeah they

418
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:33,960
would pop the cubes and they did that

419
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:36,630
all day long teeth were perfectly fun

420
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:39,480
perfectly solid including like in every

421
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:42,090
way shape a but how come you won't

422
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:44,250
hear that from the dentist

423
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:46,410
how can you won't hear that like is it

424
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:47,270
because they just want to go with the

425
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:50,580
flow of what

426
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:53,820
you know whatever it's what they teach

427
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:57,000
us in dental school and then we see

428
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:58,530
ourselves what works and what is true so

429
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,390
it's like medical school you go to

430
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:02,100
America you come out you don't know why

431
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:03,780
somebody has fibromyalgia you don't know

432
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:05,460
why they have eczema psoriasis you don't

433
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:06,660
have any answers there's no answers

434
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:08,370
taught in medical school and all the

435
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:10,410
autoimmune conditions there's no answers

436
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:12,450
talked about lupus there's no answers on

437
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:14,160
anything you just kind of go to school

438
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:16,560
you learn the nuts and bolts you come

439
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:19,380
out they stamped out and then you have

440
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:21,240
to be you have to rise above with with

441
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:23,730
with something inside of you that's why

442
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:25,680
they are the best dentists there are

443
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:27,510
hands down that's why I'm like you know

444
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:30,240
you know out of line it just does

445
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:31,830
because it's so powerful the information

446
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,710
is powerful that you guys got well I

447
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:36,660
think as dentists and as physicians

448
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:38,070
after you get out of med school in

449
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:40,620
dental school you kind of have to decide

450
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:43,440
what's right for you um dental school

451
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:45,120
taught taught me the basics but once

452
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,560
you're in it and you start seeing that

453
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,060
you know sugar doesn't cause the

454
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,890
cavities and you kind of have to make up

455
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:51,510
your own mind that way

456
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:54,500
I think the dental community is starting

457
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:56,730
to come around I was just added

458
00:16:54,500 --> 00:17:01,680
you're saying that just does not

459
00:16:56,730 --> 00:17:04,230
cause which is that's something it was

460
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,910
if you had erosion on like the outside

461
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:07,530
parts of your teeth it happy were

462
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:10,140
sucking on lemons it was the orange it

463
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:12,600
was that but it not anymore so I mean

464
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:14,070
we're coming around and I know with your

465
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:16,530
help and just kind of getting the word

466
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:19,110
out there but it takes time you know

467
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:22,770
it's you have to change an old way of

468
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:24,960
thinking you know citrus is so high in

469
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:26,670
calcium so high in calcium it's

470
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:29,190
ridiculous because wherever citrus has

471
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:31,920
grown like if you got Florida citrus

472
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:34,530
that all that sand that it's grown out

473
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:36,630
of is calcium based okay so everybody's

474
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:39,660
worried about calcium calcium right

475
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:42,960
anywhere where citrus grows the the dirt

476
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:46,350
is high in calcium so citrus is your

477
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:51,690
teeth restore her this restore or work

478
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:53,610
your teeth restore okay it actually is

479
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:55,920
your that's how we can restore tea the

480
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:58,560
citrus it's sucking on oranges it's

481
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:00,030
sucking on lemons it's that kind of you

482
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:03,900
know and that's what I mean it's like

483
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:06,540
and that information I mean is powerful

484
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:08,100
because that will protect you so your

485
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:09,840
teeth aren't falling out down the road

486
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:11,370
you think have these problems now you

487
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,660
think do you think he got the root

488
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:14,790
canals now you think you got teeth

489
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:16,440
problems now gum issues and you're

490
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:18,720
afraid to you know have lemon water

491
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:20,490
you're afraid to suck on an orange it's

492
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:24,090
just gonna get you in trouble leader

493
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:27,900
because the other part of gum health and

494
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:32,760
deep health is vitamin C good vitamin

495
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:35,190
C's huge industry and huge what happens

496
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:36,990
what happens when okay what happens when

497
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:38,940
somebody comes in with an abscess and

498
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:40,890
they're like oh my god and they come in

499
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:43,770
through the abscess and it's like and in

500
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:45,480
the hole big vitamin C right it's like

501
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:47,940
you first of all you gotta be on a lot

502
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:49,650
of vitamin C yeah vitamin C is huge I

503
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:51,900
mean you can get it obviously in fruit

504
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:54,510
you can get it with supplements good

505
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:57,270
supplements with quality supplements but

506
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:59,640
vitamin C's one of these essentials

507
00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:01,140
parts of dental health yeah remember

508
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,790
when I was 14 years old and I was

509
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,320
working on clients in the grocery store

510
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:05,700
I stocked shelves in right

511
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,049
you guys know the story I talked about

512
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:09,210
in the celery juice medical medium

513
00:19:07,049 --> 00:19:12,000
celery juice book and I was juicing

514
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:13,500
celery in the back for clients walking

515
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,899
around the store with the carriages and

516
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:18,360
stuff and a number one one person one

517
00:19:15,899 --> 00:19:20,039
individual had a you know whole thing

518
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:22,409
and they said it was puffed out to here

519
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:24,389
they had a bad abscess I said you gotta

520
00:19:22,409 --> 00:19:26,340
have the vitamin C I said you got to

521
00:19:24,389 --> 00:19:28,139
squeeze all these oranges all these

522
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:30,600
oranges and you got it you got to get an

523
00:19:28,139 --> 00:19:32,460
orange juice orange juice squeezer

524
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,990
machine right I have something that time

525
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:36,419
and you can hand do it and everything

526
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:38,039
and it recommended lots of oranges every

527
00:19:36,419 --> 00:19:39,809
day and the person said to me wait a

528
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:41,759
minute that's citrus it's gonna do

529
00:19:39,809 --> 00:19:43,769
something to my gums and teeth and they

530
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:47,009
did the oranges they did this celery

531
00:19:43,769 --> 00:19:49,110
juice and an abscess was going down when

532
00:19:47,009 --> 00:19:51,120
no antibiotic touched it they were about

533
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:54,000
to literally go into surgery and avoid

534
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:56,789
they avoided their their surgery I mean

535
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,230
yeah and I'm not anti antibiotics when

536
00:19:56,789 --> 00:20:00,120
we need them for certain things I'm

537
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:02,190
about making sure we are but we never

538
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:03,990
have to get there or we never have to

539
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:07,139
rely on them all the time we never have

540
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:09,659
to try to don't work but so those

541
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:13,519
accesses vitamin C is so important

542
00:20:09,659 --> 00:20:13,519
that's why I like the very G vitamin C

543
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:21,450
it's a good quality product so it's it's

544
00:20:18,779 --> 00:20:22,679
you know what the bottom line is is when

00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:26,970
removed we don't believe in that I don't

600
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:29,010
think it's necessary I mean I don't know

601
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:31,590
how you feel about that you know what

602
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:34,320
what happens is this is that your I

603
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:36,510
always I always see it this way if you

604
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:40,980
don't get a root canal what's your other

605
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:43,440
option an implant or bridge which

606
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:45,840
sometimes you end up with implant do you

607
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,460
get the bolts for the bridge yeah you

608
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:51,630
know I forget they're calling the stems

609
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:53,640
or so yeah yeah like for the bridge and

610
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:56,250
then you need you need also the brackets

611
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:58,110
not the brackets but you know what if

612
00:22:56,250 --> 00:23:05,220
the bridge yeah I mean you need the

613
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:06,420
framework I mean I agree and we talk

614
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:08,550
about this all the time people always

615
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:10,290
ask us they come in should we get my

616
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:12,120
root canals out what should I do

617
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:14,670
I mean sometimes you need to take them

618
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:17,280
out and get affected yeah they're some

619
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:18,750
reasons but I mean most of the time you

620
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,460
say you know you want to keep your tooth

621
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:21,080
because your other option is an implant

622
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:23,990
sometime

623
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:25,730
the plan won't work you know and not

624
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:28,160
having a tooth can be detrimental to

625
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:30,320
your oral health to your health all

626
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:33,980
around it help it affects occlusion and

627
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:37,610
mastication muscle tone so we both agree

628
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:39,530
you know we're bound to keep them if you

629
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:41,450
can if you guys come and see the dentist

630
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:42,500
and find a dentist who you trust and

631
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:46,790
we're not your enemy

632
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:50,120
but good people really here to help come

633
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:52,820
in find the dentist who you connect with

634
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:54,770
who you trust and that you won't get to

635
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:56,930
the root canal you won't need it because

636
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:58,850
you cavity won't grow you'll be taken

637
00:23:56,930 --> 00:24:01,310
care of yeah you'll get it before the

638
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:03,590
cavity gets down - exactly yeah down to

639
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:05,320
the pulp of the root there and you know

640
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:08,060
the thing is with the root canals is

641
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:11,930
what I find all these years all the

642
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:14,720
people have helped is mystery jaw pain

643
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:16,520
can lead to a couple of things it can

644
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:19,520
lead to a root canal that shouldn't have

645
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:24,760
been done correct right it can also lead

646
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:24,760
to blaming a root canal that was done

647
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:29,330
yeah exactly

648
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:32,360
they remove the tooth you still have the

649
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:33,740
jaw pain you know you dig it out clean

650
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:36,590
it still happens you know you redo it

651
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:38,300
you still have the jaw pain so this is

652
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:39,860
something that I've run into all these

653
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:41,750
years because I've gotten to my source

654
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:44,360
I've been fortunate to have the source

655
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:45,740
that I listen to and if many of you

656
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:47,420
people don't know what that is you can

657
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:49,070
research me and so forth and whatnot

658
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:52,130
maybe I'll do a YouTube all about that

659
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:55,190
someday but the bottom line is is that

660
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:57,080
when you're there so many people have

661
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:58,730
suffered with something that later on

662
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:01,520
gets diagnosed as trigeminal neuralgia

663
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:02,930
yes any might not even be diagnosed as

664
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,910
that you know they'll have the pain

665
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:07,460
that's I've seen people with perfectly

666
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:11,630
good teeth you guys perfectly good teeth

667
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:13,970
right just have pain and they go to the

668
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:20,660
dentist and they're drilling good teeth

669
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:22,880
and doing root canals I'm good in and so

670
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:24,740
you need a good dentist to kind of catch

671
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,210
wait a minute is there a real problem

672
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:27,980
with this tooth or do we have something

673
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:30,470
going on and I just you want to go to

674
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:33,630
different dentists if you can't get to

675
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:35,780
them I understand wherever you might be

676
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:37,650
and but you want you want to go to

677
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:39,540
different dentists and get different

678
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:41,070
opinions because you might catch a

679
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:43,040
dentist that's like look I don't want to

680
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:45,830
I don't want to break into these teeth

681
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:48,210
because this jaw pain could be

682
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:50,010
mysterious stuff going on that's still

683
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:54,630
going to be there after the fact yeah

684
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:56,430
absolutely there's so much virus yeah

685
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:57,840
it's yeah the whole thing with

686
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:59,160
trigeminal neuralgia it's the shingles

687
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:01,020
virus I've talked about that it's

688
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:02,970
medical medium information I put that

689
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:05,340
out there a long long time ago still

690
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:07,770
putting it out there that there's over

691
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:10,020
30 varieties of shingles so you can't

692
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:12,060
get confused by shingles meaning in the

693
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:14,850
sense where if you get a rash or not

694
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:17,460
because there's non-rational

695
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:19,620
viruses you can get a rash you can get

696
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:21,840
the shingles and then it still become

697
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:24,000
trigeminal neuralgia eventually but

698
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:26,310
either way there's non ration for

699
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,530
machine goals so you got a unit you got

700
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:30,030
to know that this is behind it even if

701
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:33,090
you didn't have the rash that's the

702
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:35,040
trigeminal neuralgia can go and shave

703
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:36,900
iris can affect all the facial nerves

704
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:38,520
they can give you Bell's palsy it cannot

705
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:40,320
beat him up I think he could just give

706
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:43,080
you neuralgia it could give you burning

707
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:45,900
burning gums did you ever hear about the

708
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:47,670
burning dog man I heard

709
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:49,920
years and years and years of helping

710
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:51,810
people yeah and they go to 20 doctors

711
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:54,480
they go to a whole bunch of it then he

712
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:56,250
finally found me and and then I would be

713
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,990
like that that's the shingles virus and

714
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:59,430
you need an antiviral protocol and I

715
00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:01,200
talked about that in the medical medium

716
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:02,580
books I mean I talked about that in the

717
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,620
first book right here I talk all about

718
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:11,220
the shingles in the first book the metal

719
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:14,360
being a first book yeah and so course I

720
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:19,010
got to pull a medical medium book out

721
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:19,010
there you know everything is there

722
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:26,150
sometimes you have to be you're not okay

723
00:27:22,929 --> 00:27:28,070
have to just put it's a knife in there

724
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:30,429
it's in there I mean the liver recipe

725
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:33,409
book I will say I started with that one

726
00:27:30,429 --> 00:27:35,299
there's a lot of information in there it

727
00:27:33,409 --> 00:27:37,029
will completely change your outlook and

728
00:27:35,299 --> 00:27:41,470
everything that was my first kind of

729
00:27:37,029 --> 00:27:41,470
eye-opener but this book is great too

730
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:45,770
well I think spirit passion because

731
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:48,350
that's that's the medical information

732
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:52,309
it's it's untampered with it's untouched

733
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:54,320
by by the industry that pays for things

734
00:27:52,309 --> 00:27:56,240
they get done so misinformation gets out

735
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:58,640
there both alternative and conventional

736
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:00,620
it's free from that it's it's for the

737
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,600
people to heal it's the truth that gets

738
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:04,190
something heal you know it's it's the

739
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:08,659
thing is with the trigeminal neuralgia

740
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:10,700
the hard part about that is is that the

741
00:28:08,659 --> 00:28:13,159
agony people feel with that whole

742
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:15,799
syndrome and so you want a good dentist

743
00:28:13,159 --> 00:28:18,590
so things don't get worse and going to

744
00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:20,929
the into the wrong direction yeah you

745
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:22,909
know what's your general neurology it's

746
00:28:20,929 --> 00:28:24,140
tricky to diagnose you have those you

747
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:26,510
have to know what you're looking for is

748
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:28,700
that you know people jump to conclusions

749
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:30,500
it's teeth and gums know it could be

750
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:32,990
something else let's wait a minute let's

751
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:35,299
not start working on the teeth just yet

752
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:37,460
we're not sure why it's happening let's

753
00:28:35,299 --> 00:28:38,840
think about it yeah there's antiviral

754
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:41,480
protocols you can do for trigeminal

755
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:43,789
neuralgia I talked about that you know I

756
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:45,649
actually have I have a new book coming

757
00:28:43,789 --> 00:28:48,020
out I'm trying to finish up I'm working

758
00:28:45,649 --> 00:28:49,760
on it's gonna have you know things like

759
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:52,610
that for different conditions so you

760
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:54,320
know what to do what to take so that is

761
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:55,700
on its way I mean I'm I'm doing

762
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,950
everything I can to get everybody to

763
00:28:55,700 --> 00:29:01,010
help I can in any way possible but it's

764
00:28:57,950 --> 00:29:02,179
like so the whole thing with with I want

765
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:06,440
to cover a little bit more with root

766
00:29:02,179 --> 00:29:09,740
canals I think so the bottom line with a

767
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:12,260
root canal is every not almost every

768
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:15,200
dentist will will blame bacteria

769
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:17,779
somewhere hidden down in a root canal do

770
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:21,289
you hear that sometimes we do we do hear

771
00:29:17,779 --> 00:29:23,330
a lot yes a lot of information about you

772
00:29:21,289 --> 00:29:25,630
know saying that fast root canal that

773
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:28,850
have been already done harbor bacteria

774
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:29,649
inside that's causing all these chronic

775
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:32,269
illnesses

776
00:29:29,649 --> 00:29:34,519
all right now I want to cut into this

777
00:29:32,269 --> 00:29:36,110
yeah this is really a good point okay

778
00:29:34,519 --> 00:29:37,970
first of all I want to tell everybody

779
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:40,100
your chronic illnesses are not caused by

780
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:42,950
a little bit of bacteria buried deep

781
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:45,289
down in a root canal it's not possible

782
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:47,929
first of all that's bacteria that

783
00:29:45,289 --> 00:29:49,909
actually sits down there if anything and

784
00:29:47,929 --> 00:29:52,130
that can't create neurotoxins for

785
00:29:49,909 --> 00:29:53,659
fibromyalgia chronic fatigue syndrome it

786
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:55,429
can't create all these different issues

787
00:29:53,659 --> 00:29:57,889
they can't create multiple sclerosis

788
00:29:55,429 --> 00:30:00,049
Rufus eczema psoriasis rheumatoid

789
00:29:57,889 --> 00:30:01,970
arthritis it can't create you know any

790
00:30:00,049 --> 00:30:04,039
chronic fatigue syndrome and can't

791
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:05,419
create tangles numbness aches and pains

792
00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:08,470
all these different things throughout

793
00:30:05,419 --> 00:30:11,600
the body all you know tics spasms

794
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:14,630
anxiety depression if you want when the

795
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:18,799
root canal is blamed on depression

796
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:20,630
it's what I've seen this is called this

797
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:22,580
is throwing darts at a barn door I think

798
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:24,409
that's that or it's just a crapshoot or

799
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:26,659
a guessing game musical chairs whatever

800
00:30:24,409 --> 00:30:28,490
you want to call it that's what it ends

801
00:30:26,659 --> 00:30:30,919
up being and people get really in

802
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:33,200
trouble from that whole philosophy or

803
00:30:30,919 --> 00:30:34,700
theory that got around somehow in

804
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,909
dentistry that's really pissed me off

805
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:39,559
because I've seen so many people hurt

806
00:30:36,909 --> 00:30:41,539
because of it when there are real

807
00:30:39,559 --> 00:30:42,740
answers to why you have while you're

808
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:44,539
diagnosed with an autoimmune condition

809
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:46,130
there's really interesting why you have

810
00:30:44,539 --> 00:30:49,039
problems and it's not because of a

811
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:50,659
little bit of bacteria that supposedly

812
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:52,100
could be at the bottom of your root

813
00:30:50,659 --> 00:30:54,320
canal so we got to rip all your root

814
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:55,789
canals out people to get rid of your

815
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,559
enemy chronic fatigue syndrome and your

816
00:30:55,789 --> 00:30:59,480
lupus and your Hashimoto's thyroiditis

817
00:30:57,559 --> 00:31:00,950
and that's your thyroid problem and your

818
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:03,289
thyroid problem is because of your root

819
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:05,179
canals grave mistake your Lyme disease

820
00:31:03,289 --> 00:31:07,490
now is because your root canals grave

821
00:31:05,179 --> 00:31:08,870
mistake I'm telling you right now if

822
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:11,149
you're running into that out there I'm

823
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:13,850
so sorry you are this is a massive

824
00:31:11,149 --> 00:31:16,100
mistake in dentistry I know so these

825
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:20,240
these to know this I mean right is that

826
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:23,240
this is just you not me and if I'm off

827
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:25,730
you know this is huge I'm still happy

828
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:27,799
just said that because we people call

829
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:29,539
and come in with exactly that let me

830
00:31:27,799 --> 00:31:31,519
move my teeth that have been root canals

831
00:31:29,539 --> 00:31:36,649
in the past because it's causing my ABC

832
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:37,940
and D no it's not yeah and so so this is

833
00:31:36,649 --> 00:31:40,580
important information

834
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:42,260
I mean you share this YouTube share it

835
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:42,890
out there send it to people you know

836
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:44,900
that

837
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:45,980
problem said that you know they go to

838
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:47,840
their dentist and they have all these

839
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:50,240
questions just that I would pass this

840
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:54,230
one around because it's that powerful

841
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:56,180
and it's rare they flew out here okay

842
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:58,340
this is really rare they flew out here

843
00:31:56,180 --> 00:32:00,020
okay from the East Coast

844
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:02,600
and they're out here on the west coast

845
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:04,880
right now okay and they flew out here to

846
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:06,830
do this they took time on their schedule

847
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:09,290
their schedules so busy they're working

848
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:13,010
on a zillion people and then and they

849
00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:15,020

they have it and so just know what you

857
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:32,870
got right here yeah I'm just saying no

858
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:34,940
that this is a really really important

859
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:36,470
day an important time and and we're all

860
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:38,630
lucky I'm lucky that they're here right

861
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:40,490
now you guys are lucky because there's

862
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:43,040
so much information so let's go into I'm

863
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:45,560
are you going to some other stuff teeth

864
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:48,290
sensitivities okay so I want to go into

865
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:52,220
that whole thing teeth sensitivities

866
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:54,080
doesn't mean the tooth has a problem you

867
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:56,830
know that's what I've learned you know

868
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:59,950
from my information from my source and

869
00:32:56,830 --> 00:33:03,530
it's more of gum it's more of nerve

870
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:05,540
sensitivities that's what it is and it's

871
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:07,490
not the food that causes a teeth

872
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:09,560
sensitivity you know that's another

873
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:12,170
thing too it's not lemon water that

874
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:14,660
causes teeth sensitivity it's not yeah

875
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:16,250
it's it's not foods that cause teeth

876
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:18,500
sensitive it's like sugar or something

877
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:21,710
else it's just it's it's sensitive

878
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:24,970
nerves you know we see that a lot as

879
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:27,140
well okay and it's it's important to

880
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:30,890
antiviral protocol we think everybody

881
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:32,960
should be on it okay that's just even if

882
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:34,580
you feel great and it takes time I mean

883
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:37,040
you have to give I mean if you're in

884
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:38,240
pain and sometimes we can't really

885
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,890
there's nothing wrong with your teeth

886
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:42,230
it's you know something viral it takes

887
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:43,940
time to for it to build up I mean it

888
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:47,030
took time to get the pain so you have to

889
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:49,460
be patient we do use the viral load do

890
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:51,500
the medical medium interim protocol

891
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:54,050
there's so much you can do so so

892
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:55,230
basically a lot of problems we get in

893
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:56,460
dentistry

894
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:58,110
a lot of problems would get with people

895
00:33:56,460 --> 00:34:00,899
going to dentists because they're sick

896
00:33:58,110 --> 00:34:02,880
is because they got low-grade viruses

897
00:34:00,899 --> 00:34:04,529
more high-grade viruses they got the ups

898
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,909
to one of the epstein-barr virus as I

899
00:34:04,529 --> 00:34:07,830
talked about one of the over 60

900
00:34:05,909 --> 00:34:10,050
varieties that's out there mutations and

901
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:11,790
strains they got that they got one of

902
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:13,260
the over 30 varieties of shingles virus

903
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:15,240
out there and if you guys think you

904
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:17,040
don't have bugs in yet I hate to break

905
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:18,599
it to you everybody's got bugs in them I

906
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:20,609
don't care if you're 20 years old if

907
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:22,349
you're 18 years old if you're 25 years

908
00:34:20,609 --> 00:34:24,419
old if you're 35 years old if you got

909
00:34:22,349 --> 00:34:26,490
bugs in you and you'll get symptoms down

910
00:34:24,419 --> 00:34:28,109
the road I've always tried to be the

911
00:34:26,490 --> 00:34:29,609
person to get that information out there

912
00:34:28,109 --> 00:34:31,800
and since because I want people to know

913
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:33,720
now so you can stop it later and get

914
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:36,300
better and protect yourself so you don't

915
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:38,280
get something too so but the whole thing

916
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:40,950
is is what Masha is saying

917
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:43,889
magine are saying is antiviral protocols

918
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:46,169
you want to be on antiviral protocols to

919
00:34:43,889 --> 00:34:48,659
protect yourself so that you don't get

920
00:34:46,169 --> 00:34:51,359
sick because what's behind everything

921
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:53,730
the teeth sensitivities the nerve pain

922
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:56,310
all of this other conditions we're

923
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:59,520
talking about what's behind it is viral

924
00:34:56,310 --> 00:35:03,450
loads viruses than the hhv-6 deciding

925
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:05,730
Begler virus in the HH v 7h h v 10 11 12

926
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:07,560
13 working undiscovered all these

927
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:09,089
viruses undiscovered many of them many

928
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:11,910
other mutations because i always talk

929
00:35:09,089 --> 00:35:14,010
about in virology it's under funded

930
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:16,200
because virology holds the answers to

931
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:17,609
get people healthy so that no one seam

932
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:20,369
spends money in the medical system

933
00:35:17,609 --> 00:35:22,140
anymore so that's why viruses are just

934
00:35:20,369 --> 00:35:24,359
you know it's all it's instead it's

935
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:26,849
talked about out microbiome now or oh

936
00:35:24,359 --> 00:35:29,339
it's Candida or oh it's something else

937
00:35:26,849 --> 00:35:30,930
and around where you go every decade to

938
00:35:29,339 --> 00:35:34,050
the young people that come up into

939
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:36,150
health right let's treat each them about

940
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:38,700
food combining again so we go nowhere

941
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:39,869
let's teach them about microbiome again

942
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:41,700
and even though they did it over and

943
00:35:39,869 --> 00:35:43,170
over again for decades and everybody

944
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:45,000
still stays sick and they don't know it

945
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:47,130
let's teach the young people about

946
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:49,079
Candida again let's teach them about

947
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:51,990
this and what happens is this whole

948
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:53,190
circle is on purpose and then all the

949
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:55,829
practitioners they just become

950
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:58,619
innocently used for this whole thing and

951
00:35:55,829 --> 00:36:00,810
then everybody each generation has the

952
00:35:58,619 --> 00:36:03,000
same old crap information and it's

953
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:04,339
regurgitating it's recycled and no one

954
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,499
gets better and we

955
00:36:04,339 --> 00:36:08,299
right that that's the whole point you

956
00:36:06,499 --> 00:36:10,219
know we need to break that and so it's

957
00:36:08,299 --> 00:36:11,809
about having a viral load it's about

958
00:36:10,219 --> 00:36:13,339
knowing that it's knowing why you're

959
00:36:11,809 --> 00:36:14,930
tired now it's knowing why you got

960
00:36:13,339 --> 00:36:16,579
floaters in the eyes and you're getting

961
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:19,519
tingles or some numbness you're getting

962
00:36:16,579 --> 00:36:20,960
an unfit its the low-grade viral stuff

963
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:22,549
it's so important for you guys to

964
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,170
understand if you're first you know

965
00:36:22,549 --> 00:36:27,799
locking on to this so let's cover some

966
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:29,450
more dental stuff too why not

967
00:36:27,799 --> 00:36:33,200
we give those questions everything else

968
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:34,789
yeah yeah yeah ran over not to remove it

969
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:37,670
I'd love to talk about that you guys are

970
00:36:34,789 --> 00:36:39,619
open to we yeah absolutely we caught a

971
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:41,599
lot of how patients come in to us and

972
00:36:39,619 --> 00:36:46,789
they've had these mercury fillings

973
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:49,279
placed 15 20 25 30 35 years ago that

974
00:36:46,789 --> 00:36:51,859
length of time in the mouth which is

975
00:36:49,279 --> 00:36:53,809
acidic environment heavy bacterial

976
00:36:51,859 --> 00:36:56,630
environment they will corrode they will

977
00:36:53,809 --> 00:36:58,789
break down over about ten year period so

978
00:36:56,630 --> 00:37:02,089
we see a lot of these fillings corroding

979
00:36:58,789 --> 00:37:04,789
pulling away from the tooth leaking

980
00:37:02,089 --> 00:37:07,130
saliva underneath and decaying the teeth

981
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:08,630
underneath so if you have a defective

982
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:10,339
filling honestly you have to have it

983
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:12,170
removed if you have a fillings that's

984
00:37:10,339 --> 00:37:18,559
fully intact we won't touch it we'll

985
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:21,319
leave it especially the person who has

986
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:22,729
symptoms and is chronically ill of

987
00:37:21,319 --> 00:37:26,479
something again we don't want to push

988
00:37:22,729 --> 00:37:30,019
him over I'll never forget 1991 1991

989
00:37:26,479 --> 00:37:33,259
I'll never forget this okay I think was

990
00:37:30,019 --> 00:37:36,170
my first I think was my first person

991
00:37:33,259 --> 00:37:38,799
that came to see me that had a whole

992
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:41,299
mouth of mercury at one time right

993
00:37:38,799 --> 00:37:43,789
nothing was wrong with them they meaning

994
00:37:41,299 --> 00:37:45,289
they were they were there they weren't

995
00:37:43,789 --> 00:37:48,319
corroding okay

996
00:37:45,289 --> 00:37:50,690
they were pretty fresh right you know

997
00:37:48,319 --> 00:37:52,219
whole mouth of it and they got told this

998
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:54,380
is right at the beginning you know you

999
00:37:52,219 --> 00:37:56,690
know about the early 90s was right when

1000
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:58,249
you get get him drilled out Mercury's

1001
00:37:56,690 --> 00:38:01,940
fillings are behind all of your sickness

1002
00:37:58,249 --> 00:38:06,200
right and this is poor woman ice why I

1003
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:08,269
just I feel bad till today today so she

1004
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:10,640
went to you knows before she came to me

1005
00:38:08,269 --> 00:38:13,609
to see me she before she came to my

1006
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:15,800
office she had them all taken out they

1007
00:38:13,609 --> 00:38:19,160
were all drilled out everywhere

1008
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:20,420
of them at the same time something I say

1009
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:22,550
you've never been the same yeah I

1010
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:24,260
remember you never you never made all

1011
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:25,760
your hurt my feelings drilled out at the

1012
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:27,530
same time you guys have been saying this

1013
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:30,740
for years I said it long before anybody

1014
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:33,830
knew it and so um she had a ball drilled

1015
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:35,750
out right and then she had I guess I

1016
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:37,790
guess at that time in 91 she had the

1017
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:39,260
replacement that wasn't mercury and in

1018
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:42,200
the early 90s it was a different kind of

1019
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:44,270
strike composite the composite right so

1020
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:46,070
the composites done but she was sicker

1021
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:47,480
than ever she was sick to begin with she

1022
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:49,400
had a ball drilled out because she had

1023
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:51,260
the chronic fatigue syndrome which is

1024
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:52,700
epstein-barr virus but nobody knew that

1025
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:54,380
then they still don't know that now

1026
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:57,230
unless I keep on bringing that

1027
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:59,480
information out and all that mercury

1028
00:38:57,230 --> 00:39:01,190
vapor went into her system so all the

1029
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:02,930
vapors for the mercury went into her

1030
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:05,180
system from the drill Alex everything

1031
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:08,300
like that it fed the virus or chronic

1032
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:10,520
fatigue syndrome got worse because it

1033
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:12,890
was so much mercury at once they didn't

1034
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:15,200
even need to be drilled out at the time

1035
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:17,240
there weren't any breaking down there

1036
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:19,640
were none corroding but get this

1037
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:24,110
so she's sicker now she's got the

1038
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:25,700
composites in then another dentist at

1039
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:27,170
the time said we need to drill out all

1040
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:28,790
your composites you're sick because you

1041
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:32,030
need mercury fillings put back through

1042
00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:35,570
they drilled all our composites out poor

1043
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:37,340
woman god bless her I swear to god she

1044
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:39,440
went through hell and back they drilled

1045
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:42,350
every one out they refilled them with

1046
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:45,350
all Mercury's like 1991 refill refilled

1047
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:47,660
them all with mercury again I mean it

1048
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:50,120
was an unbelievable process I had to

1049
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:52,550
help her clean up the viruses because it

1050
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:55,580
was her only chance at that point to

1051
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:58,190
make sure we don't really get messed up

1052
00:39:55,580 --> 00:40:00,590
yeah and I was just like just antiviral

1053
00:39:58,190 --> 00:40:02,000
anti-federal celery juice yeah I was

1054
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:03,980
recommending salaries you said early

1055
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,330
absolutely I mean it came from it came

1056
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:08,060
from spirit that's just celery juice

1057
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:09,800
celery juice have you metal detox all of

1058
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:12,080
it we pulled out as much mercury as we

1059
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:14,360
can that was floating around and then we

1060
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:15,740
went for the antiviral stuff we attacked

1061
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:17,150
the virus all the different herbs I

1062
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:18,980
talked about like lemon balm you guys

1063
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:21,560
know about so that the chronic fatigue

1064
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:23,990
syndrome that virus right there behind

1065
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:25,130
it the epstein-barr was knocked down so

1066
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:27,410
it wasn't gonna feed off of anymore

1067
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:29,839
mercury but she went through

1068
00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:33,650
so you guys are not into like drilling

1069
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:36,829
everything at once all of it breaking up

1070
00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:40,369
and if the patient is healthy has no

1071
00:40:36,829 --> 00:40:42,440
symptoms is completely nothing is going

1072
00:40:40,369 --> 00:40:51,079
on we can do maybe to two or three at a

1073
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:53,959
time because your stuff it's something

1074
00:40:51,079 --> 00:40:56,089
you kind of play it by ear you see how

1075
00:40:53,959 --> 00:40:57,140
you're feeling and even afterwards you

1076
00:40:56,089 --> 00:40:59,329
know sometimes you have to push up

1077
00:40:57,140 --> 00:41:03,440
putting taking out more for a month or

1078
00:40:59,329 --> 00:41:04,609
so cilantro in the wild blueberries and

1079
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:06,229
have all of that

1080
00:41:04,609 --> 00:41:09,019
yeah that's why that's why a good

1081
00:41:06,229 --> 00:41:11,539
dentist matters because it's like you

1082
00:41:09,019 --> 00:41:14,450

1104
00:41:56,869 --> 00:42:01,309
whatever the situation shore but I've

1105
00:41:59,509 --> 00:42:03,380
always said that that's the best to do

1106
00:42:01,309 --> 00:42:05,029
if they're fine and nothing's wrong with

1107
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:06,289
them work on getting mercury out of you

1108
00:42:05,029 --> 00:42:07,880
everywhere else in the body

00:42:06,289 --> 00:42:10,910
you're the heavy metal detox throughout

1110
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:13,309
the body you leave that alone for now

1111
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:15,259
you know and depending on what symptoms

1112
00:42:13,309 --> 00:42:17,299

1134
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:20,180
if you guys are new to knowing the truth

1135
00:43:18,589 --> 00:43:22,910
about Lyme disease because you might not

1136
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:25,099
Lyme disease was snuck recently because

1137
00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:26,540
of medical meeting information powerful

1138
00:43:25,099 --> 00:43:28,640
of millions of the books millions of

1139
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:30,950
medical media books going globally it

1140
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:33,170
freaked out the industry so the lime

1141
00:43:30,950 --> 00:43:35,200
industry changed their game because of

1142
00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:38,180
medical media so just so you know

1143
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:40,310
literally and their game new business

1144
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:41,599
what they did because I brought it to

1145
00:43:40,310 --> 00:43:42,950
the world with more the millions of

1146
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:45,109
books getting out there and everything

1147
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:46,910
because people were healing and I didn't

1148
00:43:45,109 --> 00:43:48,619
get the books all these books didn't get

1149
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:50,270
out there because I had help it was

1150
00:43:48,619 --> 00:43:52,400
because people were healing and they

1151
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:54,410
spread the word it's know the difference

1152
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:56,270
you know I didn't have money behind

1153
00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:58,130
these books like all the money that's

1154
00:43:56,270 --> 00:43:59,780
behind all the other you know authors

1155
00:43:58,130 --> 00:44:02,089
and stuff this is about people healing

1156
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:04,550
is why these books got around and what

1157
00:44:02,089 --> 00:44:06,140
happened is it the woods of truth I

1158
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:08,180
wrote about the truth about Lyme disease

1159
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:09,859
and the industry decided to take Lyme

1160
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:11,510
disease now and take it out of the whole

1161
00:44:09,859 --> 00:44:13,609
bacteria theory and stick it in the

1162
00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:15,710
autoimmune theory group so it's now

1163
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:17,240
listed as an autoimmune disease which

1164
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:18,859
means it's mysterious so they don't know

1165
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:20,089
what causes Lyme anymore they actually

1166
00:44:18,859 --> 00:44:22,310
thought it was bacteria now they don't

1167
00:44:20,089 --> 00:44:24,319
know how to do it because of me and so

1168
00:44:22,310 --> 00:44:26,990
which is it which is which I'm actually

1169
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:28,400
proud of I'm really right absolutely

1170
00:44:26,990 --> 00:44:31,130
because it's gonna heal that many more

1171
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:33,349
people but the bottom line is is Lyme

1172
00:44:31,130 --> 00:44:35,480
disease right there that's a viral load

1173
00:44:33,349 --> 00:44:37,369
right there eczema psoriasis that's a

1174
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:38,750
viral load so why is the viral load so

1175
00:44:37,369 --> 00:44:39,980
important it has everything to do with

1176
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:42,050
teeth everything to do with teeth

1177
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:43,970
problems too because when you got high

1178
00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:45,740
viruses you lose your immune system you

1179
00:44:43,970 --> 00:44:47,780
lose your minerals you lose all these

1180
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:49,910
things you get your liver gets stagnant

1181
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:52,460
sluggish you get low bile your acid

1182
00:44:49,910 --> 00:44:54,170
reflux happens low hydrochloric acid and

1183
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:55,550
you're burning out your tea

1184
00:44:54,170 --> 00:44:57,050
you get problems and you think it's

1185
00:44:55,550 --> 00:44:59,870
because you're plant-based and then

1186
00:44:57,050 --> 00:45:04,250
whatever and I always say look you know

1187
00:44:59,870 --> 00:45:05,630
I'm Pro plant-based provegan ISM I mean

1188
00:45:04,250 --> 00:45:08,210
if that's term they even use anymore

1189
00:45:05,630 --> 00:45:09,920
veganism vegan and pro all that I'm Pro

1190
00:45:08,210 --> 00:45:11,690
also animal protein people that eat

1191
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:15,170
animal protein good animal protein I'm

1192
00:45:11,690 --> 00:45:17,330
Pro all of it but I've always said you

1193
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:22,250
know I've always said no matter what you

1194
00:45:17,330 --> 00:45:24,710
know that in dentistry the dental chairs

1195
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:26,570
are not filled of vegans across the

1196
00:45:24,710 --> 00:45:29,060
globe because there's only this many

1197
00:45:26,570 --> 00:45:30,500
vegans there's only this many because I

1198
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:32,840
know there's vegan youtubers out there

1199
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:34,370
that that are out there and they're you

1200
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:35,840
know they're into the propaganda of

1201
00:45:34,370 --> 00:45:37,640
veganism they don't like the animal

1202
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:39,380
protein people and I know there's

1203
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:40,910
youtubers out there that are vegan I get

1204
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:42,170
it you guys got it seems like big

1205
00:45:40,910 --> 00:45:44,750
followings but just so you know there's

1206
00:45:42,170 --> 00:45:47,630
this many vegans it's this tiny it's a

1207
00:45:44,750 --> 00:45:50,060
grain of rice compared to a silo of rice

1208
00:45:47,630 --> 00:45:51,770
that's how many vegans are the rest are

1209
00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:53,270
animal protein people and guess what the

1210
00:45:51,770 --> 00:45:55,520
dental chairs are filled with they're

1211
00:45:53,270 --> 00:45:57,020
filled with animal protein people but

1212
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:59,060
for some reason it's never blamed on

1213
00:45:57,020 --> 00:46:00,500
their diet you g1t from it's never

1214
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:02,300
blamed on a diet but it's blamed on the

1215
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:04,280
vegans diet so if you're vegan stay

1216
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:06,320
strong and stay vegan your animal

1217
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:08,420
protein hey Sam protein I'm just saying

1218
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:10,280
that's what happens and I want it I want

1219
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:12,500
people and I want people to know who are

1220
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:14,840
vegan and play a base that I got their

1221
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:16,490
back 100% because I know what they

1222
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:18,560
really go through I know what they

1223
00:46:16,490 --> 00:46:20,540
really go through because they get they

1224
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:22,220
get tricked peer pressure in the ways

1225
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:23,870
like never before even when it seems

1226
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:25,610
like they're strong as an ox tur it

1227
00:46:23,870 --> 00:46:27,560
meaning I'm emotionally strong about

1228
00:46:25,610 --> 00:46:29,540
being vegan for three straight years the

1229
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:31,520
minute they get that first symptom and

1230
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:33,080
they their blood Sugar's off a little

1231
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:34,430
bit and they go to a doctor or some of

1232
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:36,380
them they're gone they're out of the

1233
00:46:34,430 --> 00:46:38,300
vegan thing they're gone and I feel bad

1234
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:40,550
for people like that because I want you

1235
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:41,720
back into what where you were because it

1236
00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:44,270
wasn't your problem

1237
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:45,830
it wasn't your your problem was viruses

1238
00:46:44,270 --> 00:46:48,380
your problem was that kind of stuff

1239
00:46:45,830 --> 00:46:50,660
strep bacteria that people get acne from

1240
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:53,270
your problems were these other problems

1241
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:54,560
your liver being congested and tired of

1242
00:46:53,270 --> 00:46:56,270
the fact that you weren't as a

1243
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:58,460
plant-based person or a vegan person you

1244
00:46:56,270 --> 00:47:00,650
weren't drinking celery juice or lots of

1245
00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:02,240
it and don't fall for those people on

1246
00:47:00,650 --> 00:47:02,700
YouTube that say I drank celery juice

1247
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:08,000
for five

1248
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:08,000
it didn't help me you guys know you

1249
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:24,300
changes but it takes time you have to

1250
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:26,100
give it time and I try and tell people

1251
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:29,280
at all the time you don't see results

1252
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:31,260
right away but I mean even small changes

1253
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:33,720
I've seen changes and my husband myself

1254
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:36,450
my girlfriends who doing so I'm just

1255
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:38,790
stay strong and trying to keep course

1256
00:47:36,450 --> 00:47:42,300
and you'll you'll see changes 100

1257
00:47:38,790 --> 00:47:45,630
percent yeah you know the thing is the

1258
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:47,070
thing is with the dental work is when

1259
00:47:45,630 --> 00:47:48,480
someone's sick with chronic illness and

1260
00:47:47,070 --> 00:47:50,220
you guys know there's so many of you

1261
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:52,110
sick with Roenick illness right you're

1262
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:54,060
visiting already your internist or visit

1263
00:47:52,110 --> 00:47:56,220
visiting already your doctor you're near

1264
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:58,230
your GP you're visiting your specialist

1265
00:47:56,220 --> 00:48:01,080
you're visiting your neurologist you're

1266
00:47:58,230 --> 00:48:03,390
visiting your endocrinologist right and

1267
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:05,960
then on top of that you gotta go see

1268
00:48:03,390 --> 00:48:10,110
your day you're getting dental work

1269
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:11,640
you're doing that - well when you learn

1270
00:48:10,110 --> 00:48:13,860
about how to give your health in all

1271
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:15,990
these other ways you can see the dentist

1272
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:17,490
last see the doctors less and that's

1273
00:48:15,990 --> 00:48:19,080
what it's about I mean that's what we

1274
00:48:17,490 --> 00:48:20,430
want people to do and want you guys not

1275
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:21,930
to have your whole life based around

1276
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:23,540
doctor's appointments in right

1277
00:48:21,930 --> 00:48:26,160
unless it's checkups at your dentist

1278
00:48:23,540 --> 00:48:27,750
lots of checkups or cleanings right or

1279
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:29,280
clean as good I just always want there's

1280
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:30,900
a question that always pops up that I

1281
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:32,550
hear all the time like or too many

1282
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:34,830
cleanings good how many like cleanings

1283
00:48:32,550 --> 00:48:37,200
do you get a year you know like that's a

1284
00:48:34,830 --> 00:48:39,300
question I always them always asks again

1285
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:41,700
find the dentist who you can trust and

1286
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:44,250
we will we assess our patients and we

1287
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:45,540
propose the timeline for cleanings some

1288
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:47,520
people come twice a year

1289
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:48,960
some people come three times a year and

1290
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:52,500
other people need to come four times a

1291
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:55,410
year if you have heavy load of bacteria

1292
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:58,200
and viruses and your gut health is not

1293
00:48:55,410 --> 00:48:59,970
great we see your teeth and gums

1294
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:01,820
deteriorating so we need to monitor it

1295
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:04,620
when we see that everything has improved

1296
00:49:01,820 --> 00:49:06,930
you don't have to come in as often yeah

1297
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:10,890
you can come in twice a year I mean yeah

1298
00:49:06,930 --> 00:49:13,310
the main thing is just to come in is

1299
00:49:10,890 --> 00:49:15,110
amazing it feels changing in

1300
00:49:13,310 --> 00:49:17,240
we do want to help I mean that's why we

1301
00:49:15,110 --> 00:49:18,860
became dentists so you have to in our

1302
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:20,960
office or I'm sure it's kind of you know

1303
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:23,510
you want that trust with our patients

1304
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:27,070
we'll find somebody that you trust and

1305
00:49:23,510 --> 00:49:29,600
go see them because it's not that scary

1306
00:49:27,070 --> 00:49:31,790
you know like I have people throwing

1307
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:34,190
this at me all the time they're like hey

1308
00:49:31,790 --> 00:49:35,780
aw I don't have any I don't have any

1309
00:49:34,190 --> 00:49:37,970
toxic heavy metals in me

1310
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:39,200
there's no toxic heavy metals I mean

1311
00:49:37,970 --> 00:49:41,570
that you know what I say is say did you

1312
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:43,310
have a fluoride treatment did you ever

1313
00:49:41,570 --> 00:49:44,780
yeah I had a fluoride treatment at tons

1314
00:49:43,310 --> 00:49:46,160
of them or no I don't get fluoride

1315
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:48,500
treatments but did you have ten of them

1316
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:50,300
when you were a kid and you're like

1317
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:51,650
right and you're like yeah yeah we

1318
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:53,390
shouldn't use to give everybody drops

1319
00:49:51,650 --> 00:49:55,670
yeah exactly right

1320
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:58,340
fluoride byproduct of our aluminum right

1321
00:49:55,670 --> 00:50:00,440
the severe neurotoxin but it's aluminum

1322
00:49:58,340 --> 00:50:02,690
just because it's a byproduct doesn't

1323
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:04,130
mean it's not aluminum aluminum takes

1324
00:50:02,690 --> 00:50:06,290
different forms that's how chemistry

1325
00:50:04,130 --> 00:50:07,790
works so you know fluoride is actually

1326
00:50:06,290 --> 00:50:10,540
aluminum it's just in a different form

1327
00:50:07,790 --> 00:50:13,220
and so when you're getting aluminum

1328
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:14,780
treatments you have a lot of them a lot

1329
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:16,580
of heavy metal in you so I've had people

1330
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:18,650
say anything I don't have Meyers isn't

1331
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:20,870
me yeah you do you you do because this

1332
00:50:18,650 --> 00:50:22,670
is business this happened to you do you

1333
00:50:20,870 --> 00:50:24,740
know Anthony I don't have you know I

1334
00:50:22,670 --> 00:50:25,340
don't have heavy metals in me yeah you

1335
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:27,140
do

1336
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:29,120
how many fluoride treatments have you

1337
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:32,420
had you know and that's just one aspect

1338
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:33,740
of getting metal in you so what do you

1339
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:35,570
guys do do you guys like do the

1340
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:38,270
traditional fluoride for everybody there

1341
00:50:35,570 --> 00:50:40,490
or do no no no so you're basically

1342
00:50:38,270 --> 00:50:42,710
groundbreakers you're just you just yet

1343
00:50:40,490 --> 00:50:44,360
everybody everybody is trying to move

1344
00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:48,350
away from them everybody's heading there

1345
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:50,690
I think so yeah everybody was

1346
00:50:48,350 --> 00:50:52,700
prescribing high fluoride toothpaste

1347
00:50:50,690 --> 00:50:55,520
they were doing floor treatments every

1348
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:56,630
six months for months and the results

1349
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,920
are there it's not really changing

1350
00:50:56,630 --> 00:50:59,810
anything so I think a lot of people are

1351
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:01,690
stepping away from that which is huge in

1352
00:50:59,810 --> 00:51:06,680
the deaf community because before I was

1353
00:51:01,690 --> 00:51:08,900
the end you know when I fought fluoride

1354
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:10,700
back in the early days see no one

1355
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:12,560
realizes when they just get into health

1356
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:14,210
now if you get into health now you're an

1357
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:15,560
influencer in health because you're like

1358
00:51:14,210 --> 00:51:16,869
you're eating better and you want to

1359
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:18,970
show your videos and you're in

1360
00:51:16,869 --> 00:51:20,259
Lewin sir and you got your first acne

1361
00:51:18,970 --> 00:51:22,509
and you want to like get it better by

1362
00:51:20,259 --> 00:51:25,720
getting off of gluten you don't know

1363
00:51:22,509 --> 00:51:28,150
with what would some of our open some of

1364
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:29,980
us old dogs you guys are young but some

1365
00:51:28,150 --> 00:51:30,730
of us old dogs have gone through in the

1366
00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:32,499
old days

1367
00:51:30,730 --> 00:51:34,839
like for instance I went up against the

1368
00:51:32,499 --> 00:51:36,819
fluoride thing back when and I was

1369
00:51:34,839 --> 00:51:39,099
almost crucified for it I fought for

1370
00:51:36,819 --> 00:51:40,660
where we are today in fact what I've

1371
00:51:39,099 --> 00:51:41,740
done helped us get to where you are and

1372
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:43,930
I don't think a lot of people realize

1373
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:46,329
this or appreciate it and I understand

1374
00:51:43,930 --> 00:51:49,089
why I totally get it but the whole thing

1375
00:51:46,329 --> 00:51:52,210
man I remember being screamed at

1376
00:51:49,089 --> 00:51:54,670
screamed at but people come in to see me

1377
00:51:52,210 --> 00:51:58,180
their dentists calling me saying how

1378
00:51:54,670 --> 00:51:59,819
dare you question fluoride I mean you

1379
00:51:58,180 --> 00:52:02,589
don't know what we went through is

1380
00:51:59,819 --> 00:52:04,809
unbelievable I mean it was like every

1381
00:52:02,589 --> 00:52:07,240
day was you help and save lives but you

1382
00:52:04,809 --> 00:52:09,249
get your ass kicked along the way every

1383
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:12,910
day all day long because you're up

1384
00:52:09,249 --> 00:52:15,609
against old grandfathered laws that are

1385
00:52:12,910 --> 00:52:17,349
evil and dark and that's the whole thing

1386
00:52:15,609 --> 00:52:18,910
they're evil and dark because science

1387
00:52:17,349 --> 00:52:20,410
and research thought they were on top of

1388
00:52:18,910 --> 00:52:21,549
their game now but they weren't science

1389
00:52:20,410 --> 00:52:24,130
research thinks they're on top of their

1390
00:52:21,549 --> 00:52:26,170
game now but they're not because even

1391
00:52:24,130 --> 00:52:28,119
though fluoride isn't so used so much

1392
00:52:26,170 --> 00:52:29,980
science research believes your body's

1393
00:52:28,119 --> 00:52:31,539
attacking itself your autoimmune is

1394
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:32,980
caused by your body which isn't true

1395
00:52:31,539 --> 00:52:34,900
they believe your genes is all your

1396
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:37,059
problem but that's not true your

1397
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:39,279
problems or viruses and heavy metals and

1398
00:52:37,059 --> 00:52:42,579
that's just two things there's other

1399
00:52:39,279 --> 00:52:46,390
problems too but but basically the floor

1400
00:52:42,579 --> 00:52:48,789
I think what oh my god the stuff I heard

1401
00:52:46,390 --> 00:52:51,369
when when I would get when I would try

1402
00:52:48,789 --> 00:52:54,099
to protect people or I would tell a mom

1403
00:52:51,369 --> 00:52:56,650
just yeah if your child's got the worst

1404
00:52:54,099 --> 00:52:58,450
case of Epstein Barr this is really bad

1405
00:52:56,650 --> 00:53:00,549
things are bad or your child has a

1406
00:52:58,450 --> 00:53:02,769
really bad case of strep you can't do

1407
00:53:00,549 --> 00:53:04,239
fluoride right now you do a floor they

1408
00:53:02,769 --> 00:53:06,099
do a fluoride treatment and then

1409
00:53:04,239 --> 00:53:07,509
everything goes down you know downhill

1410
00:53:06,099 --> 00:53:09,579
doctors are leavin everything's

1411
00:53:07,509 --> 00:53:12,339
happening you just the thing is that the

1412
00:53:09,579 --> 00:53:14,859
fluoride the fluoride business it was

1413
00:53:12,339 --> 00:53:17,349
such an industry of just bankroll and

1414
00:53:14,859 --> 00:53:19,900
there's so many still left you can't

1415
00:53:17,349 --> 00:53:21,910
think we're safe because we're figuring

1416
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:24,130
things out now like that there's so many

1417
00:53:21,910 --> 00:53:25,930
other landmines and potholes and traps

1418
00:53:24,130 --> 00:53:28,150
that are grandfathered in that we're up

1419
00:53:25,930 --> 00:53:29,870
against today floor I don't in fluoride

1420
00:53:28,150 --> 00:53:31,340
still you know they're still using

1421
00:53:29,870 --> 00:53:33,230
you're still using it they're still

1422
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:36,050
using mercury goings they're still using

1423
00:53:33,230 --> 00:53:37,790
so using mercury cooling so yeah so the

1424
00:53:36,050 --> 00:53:40,910
war is still on but it's nothing like it

1425
00:53:37,790 --> 00:53:42,620
was but and then and then there's you

1426
00:53:40,910 --> 00:53:44,750
know that was the whole floor I thing I

1427
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:46,670
find that when you use neurotoxins like

1428
00:53:44,750 --> 00:53:49,070
fluoride and your viral you just go

1429
00:53:46,670 --> 00:53:51,680
downhill quick so just don't ever do

1430
00:53:49,070 --> 00:53:53,750
them fluoride treatments and don't get

1431
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:56,960
tricked into the natural fluoride

1432
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:59,030
concept because that's still not even

1433
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:03,280
the answer that's based off the old

1434
00:53:59,030 --> 00:54:06,860
fluoride concept so what about that

1435
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:08,750
natural natural fluoride it's not that

1436
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:10,460
it's not the aluminum based ones it's

1437
00:54:08,750 --> 00:54:12,320
like the more natural concept of

1438
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:14,360
fluoride the you know of the lake on

1439
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:16,160
that level and they they talk about they

1440
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:18,680
put it in natural toothpastes I think

1441
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:21,520
now they do other stuff so it's not the

1442
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:24,740
real toxic you know high neuro

1443
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:26,390
antagonistic level of aluminum so I mean

1444
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:28,310
I'm hearing some dentist was telling me

1445
00:54:26,390 --> 00:54:30,740
about natural fluoride and he was saying

1446
00:54:28,310 --> 00:54:33,440
how natural fluoride is it's safer it's

1447
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:43,010
it's got you know I wouldn't just buy

1448
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:53,240
into it no good it's because people are

1449
00:54:43,010 --> 00:54:55,070
so there so that's what they teach you

1450
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:58,040
when you get out fluoride for it you

1451
00:54:55,070 --> 00:54:59,900
know the president before our treatments

1452
00:54:58,040 --> 00:55:01,250
that's what they tell you and you know

1453
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:03,440
it's kind of drilled in so it's hard to

1454
00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:06,530
let go those old concepts but yeah it's

1455
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:07,760
really not doing anything for you so so

1456
00:55:06,530 --> 00:55:09,500
what about gum disease

1457
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:11,990
ok so some of the people out that out

1458
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:13,490
there and they're gonna watch this they

1459
00:55:11,990 --> 00:55:15,260
deal with gum disease in different ways

1460
00:55:13,490 --> 00:55:16,850
and you know they get told if they're

1461
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:18,590
developing gum disease like what's your

1462
00:55:16,850 --> 00:55:21,020
recommendations when you're dealing with

1463
00:55:18,590 --> 00:55:22,970
gum disease - like how to keep your gums

1464
00:55:21,020 --> 00:55:27,010
clean how to stop them from progressing

1465
00:55:22,970 --> 00:55:29,840
is avoiding certain foods helpful I

1466
00:55:27,010 --> 00:55:33,260
think gum disease is definitely related

1467
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:36,860
to God health we do see it all the time

1468
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:39,710
I mean gum recession just deteriorating

1469
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:41,600
gums deteriorating bone that's correlate

1470
00:55:39,710 --> 00:55:43,230
to your gut health if you're eating a

1471
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:45,420
lot of processed food

1472
00:55:43,230 --> 00:55:48,359
a lot of other foods that are not great

1473
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:49,980
for you we do see it and then you how

1474
00:55:48,359 --> 00:55:54,930
doses comes back and all of that is

1475
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:56,940
intertwined if you lower the pH lower

1476
00:55:54,930 --> 00:56:00,390
the acid from eating a lot of processed

1477
00:55:56,940 --> 00:56:01,680
people drink six cups of coffee in the

1478
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:03,390
Shu drinking coffee

1479
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:04,470
I noticed a younger crowd still drinking

1480
00:56:03,390 --> 00:56:06,869
coffee they walk around with different

1481
00:56:04,470 --> 00:56:08,820
coffee coffee drinks all the time and

1482
00:56:06,869 --> 00:56:10,800
they try to try to use it as their

1483
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:12,510
intermittent fasting weapon so what they

1484
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:14,340
do is they drink coffee all day so they

1485
00:56:12,510 --> 00:56:16,650
don't eat all day so then they eat once

1486
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:17,790
and once once you know once a day so to

1487
00:56:16,650 --> 00:56:19,530
try to pull the intermittent fasting

1488
00:56:17,790 --> 00:56:21,240
game using coffee all the time and

1489
00:56:19,530 --> 00:56:24,270
they're running around but are they

1490
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:26,160
causing problems for the future future

1491
00:56:24,270 --> 00:56:28,230
because you're so acidic everything is

1492
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:30,480
breaking down in your mouth and it'll

1493
00:56:28,230 --> 00:56:32,280
you know maybe not today they won't see

1494
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:35,760
it but in a couple of years they'll see

1495
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:37,619
it when they eating great food and they

1496
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:40,140
like my great food that's causing my

1497
00:56:37,619 --> 00:56:42,720
countries it was the coffee which

1498
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:44,880
drinking for two years in the wrong yeah

1499
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:46,230
I believe in hundred percent what about

1500
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:48,720
this is a tricky one what about

1501
00:56:46,230 --> 00:56:53,460
chocolate though you know I always tell

1502
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:54,840
people that's a tough one it I know it's

1503
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:56,730
yummy I know it's good I know people

1504
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:58,440
like chocolate I mean I'm not anti

1505
00:56:56,730 --> 00:57:00,960
chocolate entirely I just know though

1506
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:02,730
for adrenals for you know spiking the

1507
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:05,609
adrenals it's really intense you got the

1508
00:57:02,730 --> 00:57:07,830
caffeine right and so that's really hard

1509
00:57:05,609 --> 00:57:11,790
but what happens is that I always find

1510
00:57:07,830 --> 00:57:12,990
is adrenaline can also cost teeth damage

1511
00:57:11,790 --> 00:57:14,910
and that's one thing I don't even know

1512
00:57:12,990 --> 00:57:17,460
if I talked about it recently on a show

1513
00:57:14,910 --> 00:57:19,230
or anything but adrenaline causes teeth

1514
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:21,960
damage the reason why I say that is

1515
00:57:19,230 --> 00:57:23,760
because maybe then you see that people

1516
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:26,369
who are stressed out whether they have a

1517
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:28,770
loss in their life or just stressed

1518
00:57:26,369 --> 00:57:31,680
around work or whatever it's happening

1519
00:57:28,770 --> 00:57:33,359
stress people manifest prompts with

1520
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:36,359
teeth and gums for sure and we always

1521
00:57:33,359 --> 00:57:38,340
say listen you under stress yes somebody

1522
00:57:36,359 --> 00:57:40,950
just passed away I'm so upset I'm

1523
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:44,580
grieving and we see it we see it every

1524
00:57:40,950 --> 00:57:46,710
day stress will break down temporarily a

1525
00:57:44,580 --> 00:57:49,230
lot of times it's it comes it's in waves

1526
00:57:46,710 --> 00:57:51,420
and then they'll come down eventually

1527
00:57:49,230 --> 00:57:52,750
thank you thing is because it's rental

1528
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:54,520
in is gross

1529
00:57:52,750 --> 00:57:57,400
it's the probably one of the most

1530
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:59,859
corrosive substances and so you know I

1531
00:57:57,400 --> 00:58:00,970
talk about medical medium book 1 this is

1532
00:57:59,859 --> 00:58:02,619
so cool that I got the books right here

1533
00:58:00,970 --> 00:58:04,900
I just love this I love this YouTube

1534
00:58:02,619 --> 00:58:07,480
live thing I mean I love it it's really

1535
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:09,430
cool and I don't know and so in this

1536
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:10,780
book I talk about the 56 different

1537
00:58:09,430 --> 00:58:12,700
blends of adrenaline and what does that

1538
00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:14,770
mean science research has no idea about

1539
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:17,260
this but adrenaline just isn't it isn't

1540
00:58:14,770 --> 00:58:19,900
your cortisol and epinephrine it's not

1541
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:22,119
it's not that it's worse it's when you

1542
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:24,490
have a loss or you been through hell and

1543
00:58:22,119 --> 00:58:26,050
back or you something's going on or

1544
00:58:24,490 --> 00:58:28,020
financial problems something is really

1545
00:58:26,050 --> 00:58:30,640
pushing you or you've been betrayed

1546
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:33,550
backstabbed maybe a best friend betrayed

1547
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:35,800
you because betrayal is is is really

1548
00:58:33,550 --> 00:58:37,480
brutal it's so brutal and hard I'm sorry

1549
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:38,619
if you guys anybody ever experienced

1550
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:40,359
that I just want to tell you that I'm

1551
00:58:38,619 --> 00:58:42,580
sorry and I understand because betrayal

1552
00:58:40,359 --> 00:58:44,500
is really rough I mean everybody

1553
00:58:42,580 --> 00:58:45,849
experiences at one point sometimes some

1554
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:48,250
people experience it worse than others

1555
00:58:45,849 --> 00:58:50,740
is brutal trust when we get her trust

1556
00:58:48,250 --> 00:58:52,240
broken when that happens and something

1557
00:58:50,740 --> 00:58:53,980
that someone just breaks us back and

1558
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:55,840
breaks our back of trust you know and

1559
00:58:53,980 --> 00:58:58,599
we're just like we're just we're spirit

1560
00:58:55,840 --> 00:59:00,310
gets down and we get hit you know you

1561
00:58:58,599 --> 00:59:01,720
you have a losses and everything else

1562
00:59:00,310 --> 00:59:03,010
and what happens is when you're going

1563
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:06,070
through that there's a different blend

1564
00:59:03,010 --> 00:59:07,780
of adrenaline to these things and and so

1565
00:59:06,070 --> 00:59:09,550
adrenaline sports you got to be careful

1566
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:11,200
you're going for you know more highs

1567
00:59:09,550 --> 00:59:12,609
with adrenaline sports I mean I love

1568
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:14,080
sports is the greatest thing ever but if

1569
00:59:12,609 --> 00:59:15,820
it becomes this thing where you're

1570
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:18,910
obsessed and it becomes an adrenalin

1571
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:20,950
based you know direction you had to it

1572
00:59:18,910 --> 00:59:22,390
aren't you you shorten your duration

1573
00:59:20,950 --> 00:59:25,450
about you'll get other problems because

1574
00:59:22,390 --> 00:59:28,150
adrenaline is so aggressive it's so

1575
00:59:25,450 --> 00:59:29,740
abrasive that it works the bones it

1576
00:59:28,150 --> 00:59:31,570
works on our bones it'll get you the

1577
00:59:29,740 --> 00:59:33,339
osteopenia I mean especially if you have

1578
00:59:31,570 --> 00:59:35,770
toxic heavy metals and high adrenaline

1579
00:59:33,339 --> 00:59:38,140
you get the osteopenia you get different

1580
00:59:35,770 --> 00:59:41,530
problems get the osteoporosis adrenaline

1581
00:59:38,140 --> 00:59:42,700
is one of those acid dissolved basically

1582
00:59:41,530 --> 00:59:45,670
it's a dissolvent

1583
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:48,460
and a solvent in a way to because it can

1584
00:59:45,670 --> 00:59:50,440
run through bones and so and and teeth

1585
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:53,770
teeth are credibly that are susceptible

1586
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:55,780
to this so when there's a so so we can't

1587
00:59:53,770 --> 00:59:57,910
we can't protect yourselves from every

1588
00:59:55,780 --> 00:59:59,410
loss and from every betrayal and from

1589
00:59:57,910 --> 01:00:00,940
every trust breakage and from all the

1590
00:59:59,410 --> 01:00:03,250
how we go through whether you're young

1591
01:00:00,940 --> 01:00:04,810
or older and we can't you know we can't

1592
01:00:03,250 --> 01:00:05,940
protect yourselves from every bit of

1593
01:00:04,810 --> 01:00:08,099
those things and really

1594
01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:11,490
in ships and everything I mean I've seen

1595
01:00:08,099 --> 01:00:12,869
I've had stories of you know a newly

1596
01:00:11,490 --> 01:00:14,790
weds getting married they're

1597
01:00:12,869 --> 01:00:16,500
20-something years old and the 31 years

1598
01:00:14,790 --> 01:00:18,660
old or something in that realm and they

1599
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:20,190
get married and then the girl comes down

1600
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:22,380
with Hashimoto's thyroiditis and the

1601
01:00:20,190 --> 01:00:24,300
boys like I didn't buy into this I don't

1602
01:00:22,380 --> 01:00:25,710
know what this is and it scares that you

1603
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:27,060
this used to happen and over the decades

1604
01:00:25,710 --> 01:00:29,339
I've watched this for years and I'll

1605
01:00:27,060 --> 01:00:32,099
suddenly break up and then it's like

1606
01:00:29,339 --> 01:00:34,140
it's like it's it's a it's what happens

1607
01:00:32,099 --> 01:00:36,420
is it hurts so much you can't avoid all

1608
01:00:34,140 --> 01:00:39,270
these different things and I get this

1609
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:41,130
happens but I gotta tell you that when

1610
01:00:39,270 --> 01:00:42,660
you take care of yourself you can defend

1611
01:00:41,130 --> 01:00:44,069
yourself from that adrenaline you can

1612
01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:46,380
defend yourself from that stress so that

1613
01:00:44,069 --> 01:00:48,720
your adrenaline doesn't start taking

1614
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:50,040
down your teeth over time I've seen

1615
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:53,130
people go through a really trying time

1616
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:55,050
and a hard time and then the teeth

1617
01:00:53,130 --> 01:00:57,900
become time capsules to what happened

1618
01:00:55,050 --> 01:01:00,119
four years ago the adrenaline really was

1619
01:00:57,900 --> 01:01:02,400
high then whipping them whipping you

1620
01:01:00,119 --> 01:01:04,619
really hurting them and then four years

1621
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:07,170
later they're thinking it's everything

1622
01:01:04,619 --> 01:01:09,119
else they're doing right but their teeth

1623
01:01:07,170 --> 01:01:11,069
are falling when it was four years ago

1624
01:01:09,119 --> 01:01:13,200
from a breakup they had a relationship

1625
01:01:11,069 --> 01:01:14,579
or some kind of problem they had four or

1626
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:16,829
five six seven years ago

1627
01:01:14,579 --> 01:01:18,359
and that's how it works and I don't you

1628
01:01:16,829 --> 01:01:19,950
know and so this information is so

1629
01:01:18,359 --> 01:01:22,619
powerful to help you guys and they're

1630
01:01:19,950 --> 01:01:23,970
they're aware of it so basically there

1631
01:01:22,619 --> 01:01:25,500
are things you can do like the celery

1632
01:01:23,970 --> 01:01:27,420
juice to help protect you against your

1633
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:29,940
ear and hear the adrenaline from

1634
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:31,560
hardship and the wild blueberries and a

1635
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:33,150
lot of the medical medium information

1636
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:34,680
the different foods I talked about and

1637
01:01:33,150 --> 01:01:36,900
and here's the last thing I want to talk

1638
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:41,849
about the no foods what foods to stay

1639
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:43,710
away from you guys are food experts you

1640
01:01:41,849 --> 01:01:45,810
guys are doctors you guys know how the

1641
01:01:43,710 --> 01:01:47,940
world works you guys all you know what

1642
01:01:45,810 --> 01:01:50,490
what foods like are you thinking about

1643
01:01:47,940 --> 01:01:56,520
on your end I mean well we personally

1644
01:01:50,490 --> 01:01:58,170
implemented no eggs that was a personal

1645
01:01:56,520 --> 01:02:01,400
choice everybody comes to it on their

1646
01:01:58,170 --> 01:02:04,200
own time but we we've seen differences

1647
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:06,359
subtle differences bigger differences of

1648
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:10,500
deployments that have in my family with

1649
01:02:06,359 --> 01:02:12,960
my kids my husband definitely celery

1650
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:15,630
juice and the detox heavy-metal smoothie

1651
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:17,970
is amazing it's really great I think if

1652
01:02:15,630 --> 01:02:18,450
you stick with it for at least 30 days

1653
01:02:17,970 --> 01:02:21,510
which

1654
01:02:18,450 --> 01:02:24,780
so easy you will see the difference I

1655
01:02:21,510 --> 01:02:25,950
know that's incredible because um I mean

1656
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:27,480
because you guys have witnessed it

1657
01:02:25,950 --> 01:02:30,180
yourself that's the whole point we have

1658
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:31,890
and we you know we walk the walk we do

1659
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:35,730
it every morning I'd better start

1660
01:02:31,890 --> 01:02:42,780
walking I'd better and this is the

1661
01:02:35,730 --> 01:02:45,540
better uh please when I first started

1662
01:02:42,780 --> 01:02:48,060
doing your protocols I was all about low

1663
01:02:45,540 --> 01:02:49,470
carb no fruit egg whites every morning

1664
01:02:48,060 --> 01:02:52,050
cuz that was what my trainer was having

1665
01:02:49,470 --> 01:02:54,089
me go I mean that's what you need and it

1666
01:02:52,050 --> 01:02:55,500
took time I've been doing celery juice

1667
01:02:54,089 --> 01:02:56,190
now with my husband every morning for

1668
01:02:55,500 --> 01:03:00,210
two years

1669
01:02:56,190 --> 01:03:02,310
did I see results right away no but it's

1670
01:03:00,210 --> 01:03:04,320
it's just changed our life my husband

1671
01:03:02,310 --> 01:03:06,089
used to suffer from eczema he doesn't

1672
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:08,010
have that anymore I used to have just

1673
01:03:06,089 --> 01:03:09,869
like bloating issues everything is gone

1674
01:03:08,010 --> 01:03:11,490
it helps with like whenever you're

1675
01:03:09,869 --> 01:03:12,410
anxious about something it just kind of

1676
01:03:11,490 --> 01:03:15,930
calms you down

1677
01:03:12,410 --> 01:03:17,790
it's little subtle changes and but start

1678
01:03:15,930 --> 01:03:22,530
small start with the celery juice and

1679
01:03:17,790 --> 01:03:24,990
get rid of eggs to eat the eggs will

1680
01:03:22,530 --> 01:03:26,520
feed the viruses that's why you know the

1681
01:03:24,990 --> 01:03:28,319
dairy products that feed the buyers is

1682
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:30,180
okay the gluten will feed the viruses

1683
01:03:28,319 --> 01:03:32,069
nobody knew gluten fed anything until

1684
01:03:30,180 --> 01:03:34,230
medical medium information came to town

1685
01:03:32,069 --> 01:03:37,349
they just thought gluten created in

1686
01:03:34,230 --> 01:03:39,690
fluent inflammation somehow but that's

1687
01:03:37,349 --> 01:03:41,640
not how it works the gluten has to feed

1688
01:03:39,690 --> 01:03:43,800
above the bug has to produce a poison

1689
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:45,390
then you get inflammation and that's

1690
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:46,740
information that only came from medical

1691
01:03:45,390 --> 01:03:48,000
medium originally and I hear doctors

1692
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:49,380
talking about it now because that's how

1693
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:52,290
many books got out there but the point

1694
01:03:49,380 --> 01:03:54,150
is is that the no foods is critical for

1695
01:03:52,290 --> 01:03:55,710
dental issues for dental problems for

1696
01:03:54,150 --> 01:03:57,540
keeping yourself healthy for making sure

1697
01:03:55,710 --> 01:03:59,250
you don't fall apart down the road no

1698
01:03:57,540 --> 01:04:00,930
foods is critical so whatever if you

1699
01:03:59,250 --> 01:04:02,339
believe in some animal proteins you know

1700
01:04:00,930 --> 01:04:04,800
eat them if you believe in being

1701
01:04:02,339 --> 01:04:06,720
plant-based you to go that route or

1702
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:08,310
anything in between but just remember

1703
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:10,560
keep away your eggs your dairy products

1704
01:04:08,310 --> 01:04:12,210
keep away of course your gluten duh but

1705
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:13,770
you know I say Doug because you know

1706
01:04:12,210 --> 01:04:15,780
somebody we like oh well he you know

1707
01:04:13,770 --> 01:04:17,579
somebody else knew that pride before him

1708
01:04:15,780 --> 01:04:19,380
let me tell you I was telling people to

1709
01:04:17,579 --> 01:04:22,410
get off gluten when I was four or five

1710
01:04:19,380 --> 01:04:24,780
years old four five six years old and

1711
01:04:22,410 --> 01:04:29,780
I'm an old dude and that was a long time

1712
01:04:24,780 --> 01:04:31,680
ago I'm just letting you know and so a

1713
01:04:29,780 --> 01:04:33,420
lot of concepts

1714
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:35,040
there now that have been out there

1715
01:04:33,420 --> 01:04:37,350
because you know I spread them out I

1716
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:39,450
mean I've delivered that information a

1717
01:04:37,350 --> 01:04:40,740
long time ago and now they're out there

1718
01:04:39,450 --> 01:04:41,280
and people are trying to teach it back

1719
01:04:40,740 --> 01:04:43,050
to me

1720
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:45,210
we're just hilarious and I love that

1721
01:04:43,050 --> 01:04:47,820
it's good news it's so glad I'm so glad

1722
01:04:45,210 --> 01:04:49,980
it got out there but the bottom line is

1723
01:04:47,820 --> 01:04:51,870
that no foods is important so keep that

1724
01:04:49,980 --> 01:04:54,060
in mind so you can stay healthy not feed

1725
01:04:51,870 --> 01:04:57,270
your pathogens not feed your viral viral

1726
01:04:54,060 --> 01:04:59,880
load not not cause any problems but uh

1727
01:04:57,270 --> 01:05:04,890
