don't know it do you know anybody who

22
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:01,680
Soul search

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,120
they Soul searched before they're

24
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,360
soul-searching

25
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:09,240
anybody that you may know

26
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:10,680
even if they don't know their soul

27
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:13,200
searching

28
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:15,060
even if they don't call it that so it's

29
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,799
not like we're calling it that

30
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,840
says you're living your life and you

31
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:23,100
feel lonely

32
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:24,420
you feel scared you feel lost you feel

33
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:28,439
confused

34
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:31,320
you feel like you're lacking purpose

35
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:34,820
you feel like you don't have confidence

36
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,820
or you're losing confidence

37
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:38,400
but what happens is we're actually

38
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,500
soul-searching

39
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,299
even if someone seems like the most

40
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:47,040
confident person

41
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:50,100
like their confidence is over the top

42
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,119
even if someone's ego is just way up

43
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:54,060
here

44
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:57,119
I'm the best there is

45
00:01:54,060 --> 00:02:02,100
you're a crap and I'm the best even if

46
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:05,880
someone's ego is just way up here

47
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:08,459
even if somebody's pride and ego and

48
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:11,220
confidence is way up here

49
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:14,420
they're still soul-searching and they'll

50
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:14,420
still soul-search

51
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:20,580
the most spiritual people on the planet

52
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:22,920

00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:25,560
the most awakened

54
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:27,780

top of a mountain

59
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:40,459

60
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:40,459

00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,000

lost

119
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,680
or we don't feel whole

120
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:21,259
do you ever have that feeling where

121
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:21,259
you just don't feel like a whole person

122
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:26,639
you feel like there's a piece missing

123
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,500
are a part of you that's missing and you

124
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,600
don't feel whole

125
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:32,639
did you ever have that experience where

126
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,560
you don't feel that

127
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,240
you don't feel like you're whole or

128
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,039
because we feel like we're not living up

129
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,139
to our Soul's potential

130
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:42,300
how many people feel like I'm not living

131
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:44,220
up

132
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:46,979
to the standard that I make for myself

133
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:50,400
on not living up to my full potential

134
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:54,500
I'm not living up to my soul's potential

135
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,500
how many people feel that way

136
00:05:54,600 --> 00:06:00,360
we Soul search because of life's

137
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:02,699
hardships too

138
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,440
heart the hardship scale let's talk

139
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:06,660
about that a little bit

140
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:09,240
it's interesting

141
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:12,800
I've seen people

142
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,800
go through atrocities

143
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:19,020
and they had

144
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,360
unbelievable hardships

145
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:23,880
where if they tell someone you don't

146
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,259
even you you can't

147
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,240
even

148
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:29,520
you don't have words you can't fathom

149
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:32,100
what that's like

150
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:34,500
people that have been in difficult

151
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:37,139
hardships

152
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:39,360
and those hardships take them to a place

153
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:43,080
of soul-searching

154
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:45,860
and then you have people where they had

155
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,860
hardships too

156
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,699
but the scale is so different for

157
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:54,660
everyone

158
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:56,340
for everybody the scale is so different

159
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:58,500
there's different levels of hardships

160
00:06:56,340 --> 00:07:01,979
but it depends on which world you live

161
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:04,460
in you can be someone who's silver spoon

162
00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:04,460
fed

163
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:10,680
right great support system not a care in

164
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:12,960
the world no financial problems

165
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:15,960
whatsoever

166
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:18,479
a family giving you support you go off

167
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:20,160
to private schools

168
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:23,180
everybody's worried about you everybody

169
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,180
is taking care of you

170
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:28,020
you don't have to worry about anything

171
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:30,060
and you can still have a hardship

172
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:31,860
still have a hardship

173
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:33,960
and still get affected

174
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:36,900
like the scale is different for everyone

175
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:38,639
and then you can be someone that comes

176
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:43,199
from nothing

177
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:45,240
and got hit by a train or a bus and

178
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,520
you just climb out of that and you go

179
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,620
but there's hardships the hardship skill

180
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,479
is really interesting I never talked

181
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:54,599
about the hardship scale I should go

182
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:57,180
into that more deeply

183
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:59,220
often a negative experience or a series

184
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:01,800
of them will prompt a person to feel

185
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:05,479
broken or depleted who feels depleted

186
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,479
when you go through something

187
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:12,360
how many people feel like they're so

188
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:14,220
low on Reserves

189
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:16,259
they've been through a lot they've been

190
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:18,180
through a lot of trauma they've had some

191
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:19,620
heartaches and breakup maybe they had a

192
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:21,300
relationship breakup and you feel like

193
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:24,000
your heart was ripped out of your chest

194
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:25,740
and stomped on

195
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,979
and

196
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:31,800
you just get wasted from it and your

197
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:34,159
reserves get really low your reserves

198
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,159
are low

199
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:39,240
it's a lot of people that feel depleted

200
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:41,039
from that Alexandria Sophia says what

201
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,020
makes the scale so different is that

202
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:45,260
karma from past lives really good

203
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,260
question

204
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,279
really good question

205
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,540
the scale is so different you're talking

206
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:56,880
about Alexandria you're talking about

207
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:59,040
the scale as far as what makes the

208
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,680
difference of someone having a much more

209
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:04,440
difficult situation a difficult hardship

210
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,820
versus somebody else was what seems like

211
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:08,459
a lesser hardship and that's another

212
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:10,440
discussion too but there's also

213
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:12,959
how someone

214
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:15,120
receives that hardship so what I was

215
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:17,399
saying was you can get somebody that

216
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:21,420
goes through something terrible

217
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:24,120
and they seem to be bearing it

218
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:26,519
and then you can get someone that they

219
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:29,700
went through something very small

220
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:32,220
but it feels so bad it feels so bad

221
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:34,459
there's a scale that happens within

222
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:34,459
everyone

223
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:39,000
where's somebody else I'd be like wait a

224
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:41,100
minute you're you're that hurt over that

225
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,320
and the person's like I'm deeply hurt

226
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:46,380
deeply deeply hurt you don't understand

227
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:48,540
me you don't understand who I am you

228
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:51,000
don't understand how I feel I am deeply

229
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:52,740
deeply hurt

230
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,420
and someone else would be like I

231
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:57,360
understand what you're saying but I

232
00:09:54,420 --> 00:10:00,420
don't see why you're that hurt because I

233
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:03,260
fell off a cliff and hit my head on a

234
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:03,260
rock down below

235
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:07,920
and it was a terrible trauma because

236
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,580
someone pushed me off the cliff

237
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:15,920
but I I've handled it I've tried to get

238
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:15,920
past it and someone else is like

239
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,740
you know they had a different experience

240
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:22,260
for something what seems like much

241
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:23,640
smaller because the hardship scaled you

242
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:25,200
can't measure it is what I'm trying to

243
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:27,240
tell you you can't measure it it's

244
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,980
unmeasurable how people feel with their

245
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:31,980
soul and what's going on inside their

246
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:35,160
souls Gina says I agree I just lost my

247
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:36,240
mother quit my job in healthcare and I'm

248
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:39,120
lost

249
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:41,160
light blast was great which I want to do

250
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,200
another light Blast coming up but we

251
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:45,120
have to do the on collecting Stones

252
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:49,339
meditation journey I just think I was

253
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,339
one of the ten that was last

254
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:58,440
we want to feel complete again we don't

255
00:10:56,459 --> 00:11:00,300
want to feel depleted we don't want to

256
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:03,680
feel like our reserves are low we want

257
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:03,680
to feel complete again

258
00:11:05,779 --> 00:11:11,339
that's soul-searching it can take the

259
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:13,620
form of attending Retreats going to hear

260
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:16,560
inspirational speakers because we're

261
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:18,240
soul-searching seeking advice from loved

262
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,220
ones

263
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,019
signing up to every single spiritual

264
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:23,820
course in the world and paying two three

265
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:25,200
thousand dollars or whatever it takes to

266
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:27,420
just

267
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,740
go sit with the best spiritual leaders

268
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,740
because we're soul-searching

269
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:36,300
enrolling in therapy or any other number

270
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,980
of other activities that's what we do

271
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:40,079
that's what people do out there we're

272
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:42,959
soul-searching we're looking for answers

273
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:45,600
we feel lost we feel there's a sadness

274
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:49,740
inside of us we feel like

275
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:51,839
something is wrong something's missing

276
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:55,019
it's what we do when we're looking to

277
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:57,720
heal and Elevate our souls

278
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:59,880
to strengthen our purpose in life

279
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:03,000
if you guys just got on here

280
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:04,980
Jeanette gendrum says on Facebook I

281
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,620
don't have time and money for soul

282
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:12,060
searching too busy keeping kids and

283
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:13,500
animals alive completely understand

284
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,940
because you know what you're doing is

285
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:17,899
survival

286
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:17,899
it's survival

287
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:22,440
I actually respect and appreciate that

288
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:25,560
comment

289
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:28,260
Juliet says I'm depleted I have had the

290
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:29,579
most chaotic and traumatizing past

291
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:32,540
for months

292
00:12:29,579 --> 00:12:32,540
past months

293
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,860
that's what we do when we're looking to

294
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:42,300
heal and Elevate our souls to strengthen

295
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:46,279
our purpose in life

296
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:46,279
your soul resides in your brain

297
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:49,680
powerful piece of information right

298
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,139
there

299
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:55,260
it resides in your brain I've said this

300
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:58,200
before it's why intuitively and

301
00:12:55,260 --> 00:13:01,500
instinctively they would chop people's

302
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:05,160
heads off and stick them on pikes

303
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:07,320
it's why they used to Guillotine people

304
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:09,959
they hate it the most

305
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:11,760
they didn't just stab them to death

306
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:14,040
they didn't just drown them they

307
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,839
Guillotine them they wanted their heads

308
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,880
severed off their body

309
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:19,800
because there was something back in the

310
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:23,339
Dark Ages

311
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:27,060
there was something back then

312
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:30,120
that instinctively told

313
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:32,779
the human race that something is inside

314
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,779
of here

315
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:41,100
Cassie Healy says is there an end to the

316
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:43,560
soul-searching

317
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:45,360
it's a really good question

318
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:48,019
and how many lifetimes are we

319
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,019
soul-searching

320
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:55,380
people don't realize it but we take

321
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:58,320
all of our experiences

322
00:13:55,380 --> 00:14:00,660
all of our knowledge

323
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,680
we take it with us

324
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:03,680
when we leave here

325
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:08,940
because the physical brain isn't the

326
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:11,940
only place that harnesses

327
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:13,920
information the neurons and the glial

328
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:16,800
cells isn't the only place that's

329
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:20,579
harboring information

330
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:22,620
the soul is harboring experiences and

331
00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:27,440
information

332
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:27,440
our soul that resides here

333
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:35,300
is harboring information from every

334
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,300
single lifetime

335
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:39,600
I hope it no one's offended if I even

336
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:43,940
say that because someone might say no

337
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,940
there's only one lifetime that's it

338
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,820
I pose a question to you or pose a

339
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:53,880
question

340
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:56,399
if you're in with tremendous respect and

341
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:59,600
no judgment if someone believes it's

342
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,600
only a one-time thing

343
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:05,160
we're here we're gone

344
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:09,740
we have no soul

345
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:09,740
we cease to exist and that's it

346
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:16,100
everybody has their right to believe in

347
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:16,100
anything they believe in

348
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:19,160
but keep in mind

349
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,959
where is it in the present time right

350
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,959
now

351
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,279
how is it possible

352
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:32,300
we're all here

353
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,300
on the front line

354
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,420
think about that for a minute

355
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:38,699
I want to go deeper into that Jake Davis

356
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:41,160
says I spent so many years after I lost

357
00:15:38,699 --> 00:15:43,740
both of my parents

358
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:46,139
lost and depleted

359
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:47,880
after about a month of living in mm

360
00:15:46,139 --> 00:15:50,040
lifestyle

361
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:52,380
I started to get my life back and felt

362
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:54,120
like that void was finally being filled

363
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:56,300
Jake thank you for being here you're on

364
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,300
YouTube

365
00:15:56,459 --> 00:15:59,760
foreign

366
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,380
how is it possible

367
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:03,899
that we

368
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:04,920
are on the front line of time itself

369
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:06,720
right now

370
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:09,660
think about it every minute that clicks

371
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:12,560
forward every second that clicks forward

372
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:12,560
is the front line

373
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:17,300
we are on the front line right now

374
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,360
you're not in the past right now 500

375
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,760
years

376
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:26,160
ago

377
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:28,339
you're not in the future 500 years from

378
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,339
now

379
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:32,220
you're on

380
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,260
the brink

381
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:37,259
the edge

382
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:39,720
you're on the front line pushing forward

383
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:41,519
into the future second by second by

384
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:44,339
second by second

385
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:48,139
well how did you manage to end up here

386
00:16:44,339 --> 00:16:48,139
after billions of years

387
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:54,300
and katrillions

388
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:55,920
of people that have passed and gone

389
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,940
they've lived their life they died they

390
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,339
gone

391
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:01,680
with their life they died they're gone

392
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:03,240
civilizations

393
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:07,160
centuries and centuries of people

394
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:07,160
thousands of years of civilizations

395
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:15,839
how is it possible with all that

396
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,400
you think we were just chosen to be on

397
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:19,380
the front line right now

398
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:22,220
at the very second that's pushing

399
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:22,220
forward into time

400
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:26,040
that of all the trillions of people the

401
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,720
billions and billions of people and the

402
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:29,880
centuries and the thousands of years of

403
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:31,679
civilizations for some reason were just

404
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:34,140
picked to be on the front line of time

405
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:36,240
aren't we special

406
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:38,520
aren't we special

407
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:41,880
no it's because

408
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:45,140
we came around again

409
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:45,140
we came around again

410
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,140
Evan says I really hope you are coming

411
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:51,179
out with your spiritual book that got

412
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:52,860
delayed by prior events indeed it did

413
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:55,740
get delayed in fact it was canceled for

414
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:57,980
the year I'm not even able to work on it

415
00:17:55,740 --> 00:18:01,020
I've lost the opportunity for this year

416
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:03,539
see Evan says I am looking forward to

417
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:06,179
that so much I am too I've been kept

418
00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:08,100
busy by a lot of Darkness obviously you

419
00:18:06,179 --> 00:18:09,900
guys are up on what's happened and

420
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:11,640
what's going on I don't know if you

421
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:13,799
listen to the medical meeting podcast at

422
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:15,360
Apple podcast

423
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:17,340
the last

424
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,500
few episodes I don't know if you've

425
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:22,200
actually got a chance

426
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:25,260
but yeah

427
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:27,120
that was completely robbed from the

428
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:30,120
medical medium community and robbed from

429
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,780
me to be able to actually

430
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:33,419
um

431
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:36,380
fulfill a duty

432
00:18:33,419 --> 00:18:38,820
which is to hand in my spiritual book

433
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:40,980
start complete and hand in my spiritual

434
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:43,200
book for this year so we can have that

435
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:46,340
to the publisher

436
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,340
that never happened

437
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:53,120
yep

438
00:18:55,620 --> 00:19:02,240
Anya says aw can you share why this time

439
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:02,240
right now so significant

440
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:09,360
well think about it right now we're on

441
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:12,299
the front line of time as we speak all

442
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:14,400
together in this moment

443
00:19:12,299 --> 00:19:16,860
which means we've

444
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,840
most likely been here before and before

445
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:21,480
and before and as I was saying before

446
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:23,700
our soul carries information you might

447
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:26,220
not be able to tap into it and tap into

448
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:27,960
your soul and the information that

449
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:29,340
you've taken over from Lifetime to

450
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:31,679
Lifetime

451
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:33,840
but I've learned all this from Spirit of

452
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,280
compassion by the way

453
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:38,220
you may not

454
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:40,320
be privy to the information that's

455
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:42,780
passed on

456
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:45,840
over and over and over again meaning

457
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:47,160
into boom another body your soul you

458
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,080
live a life you get all these

459
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:51,000
experiences in for information you die

460
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:54,120
your soul contains that spiritual

461
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:58,700
information all that knowledge

462
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:58,700
and you may not be able to tap into it

463
00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:02,059
um

464
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:06,840
that you think we're all here by chance

465
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:09,360
just by chance

466
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:11,580
with all those people who have been on

467
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,080
this planet alone never mind how many

468
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,919
people have been on other planets you

469
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:17,100
think

470
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:20,660
we've just suddenly have all just we're

471
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:20,660

working on medical medium information

481
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:50,460
foreign

482
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,160
there's a lot of tools

483
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:58,940
that so many people have used here to

484
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,940
get their lives back

485
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:05,480
Cold Light spring

486
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:05,480
I I read your comments it's gone up now

487
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,260
um

488
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:14,760
they contacted the journalist right

489
00:21:12,539 --> 00:21:16,200
before brain saver I bet that book was

490
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:18,720
the target

491
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:21,780
but the journalists spent so much time

492
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:25,460
writing and questioning what he was fed

493
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:25,460
so they only delayed this one

494
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,760
um

495
00:21:30,659 --> 00:21:34,559
your soul also stores your hope and your

496
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,820
faith in your trust so that I want to

497
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:37,440
talk about a little bit have you ever

498
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:39,840
had your trust broken

499
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:42,360
just broken

500
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:46,380
never had your faith

501
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:48,480
really tested really test it

502
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:50,159
you trust your faith your hope

503
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:53,700
crashed

504
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:56,159
crushed and smashed

505
00:21:53,700 --> 00:22:00,320
your soul stores your hope your faith

506
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:00,320
and your trust stores it

507
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:06,480
all of which help keep you on the right

508
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:08,100
path that's a mechanism that helps to

509
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,460
keep us strong and keep us on the right

510
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,460
path

511
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:16,320
ideally

512
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:18,360
we would have fully intact Souls over

513
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:21,360
the course of life's hardships though a

514
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:22,740
soul can become fractured a soul can

515
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,179
become fractured have you ever met

516
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:27,900
anyone where

517
00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:30,480
if you use your intuitive capabilities

518
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:33,360
and intuitive strengths

519
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:35,039
you can almost

520
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:38,280
kind of like

521
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:41,100
just see it and understand that the

522
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:45,500
other person might have some fractures

523
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:45,500
they get triggered they're struggling

524
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:54,000
this can be caused by traumatic events

525
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:55,980
such as the death of a loved one

526
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,919
betrayal by a loved one betrayal by

527
00:22:55,980 --> 00:23:01,140
oneself as well as ongoing traumas such

528
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:03,179
as the loss of freedom and trust that

529
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:04,740
comes with experiencing chronic illness

530
00:23:03,179 --> 00:23:07,620
and symptoms so I want to go into that a

531
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:10,320
little bit when we get sick we then lose

532
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:13,820
faith in a lot of things we lose faith

533
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:16,500
in the pharmaceutical industry for one

534
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:20,000
people have chronic illness they lose

535
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:20,000
faith in the pharmaceutical industry

536
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:26,100
medicine

537
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:28,220
in medical science has a lot to offer

538
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:30,659
life-saving surgeries

539
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:35,299
life-saving procedures

540
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:35,299
but there's this whole massive massive

541
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:40,799
swath of people

542
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:42,240
that suffer from chronic symptoms and

543
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:44,520
conditions

544
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,380
and they suffer greatly and they haven't

545
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:48,000
been able to find answers and they feel

546
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:49,919
like their body has let them down they

547
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,659
feel like their body's shutting down

548
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:52,980
they feel like

549
00:23:51,659 --> 00:23:55,140
um

550
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:58,260
they can't get better and they've tried

551
00:23:55,140 --> 00:24:01,640
everything and they've done everything

552
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:01,640
that's really hard for people

553
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:09,419
when Soul injuries are fresh they can

554
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:11,700
result in feeling

555
00:24:09,419 --> 00:24:13,080
of being lost

556
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:15,240

persevere or or Thrive or even loss of

585
00:25:24,059 --> 00:25:28,320
life force and that's what happens too

586
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:30,179
when we just get broken down and beaten

587
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:33,120
down we feel like we don't have our life

588
00:25:30,179 --> 00:25:36,080
force anymore we feel like we've lost

589
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,080
our life force

590
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:45,960
and then wounds from hardship betrayal

591
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:47,700
and broken trust or emotional hurt often

592
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:49,380
exhaust the person's immune systems

593
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:51,000
that's another thing too like it's like

594
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:53,760
I can't tell you how many times I've

595
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:56,760
seen with relationship breakups

596
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,760
foreign

597
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:04,020
those relationship breakups

598
00:26:00,419 --> 00:26:05,820
people's immune system just tanks

599
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:07,679
it's like one too many relationship

600
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:09,720
breakups and their immune system just

601
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:12,240
gets so low

602
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:14,039
because it's exhausting especially if

603
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,659
you're staying up all night you're not

604
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:19,020

605
00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:21,659
you feel hurt you feel that pit in your

606
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:26,659
stomach and this can drop down our

607
00:26:21,659 --> 00:26:26,659
immune systems and defense defenses

635
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:46,380
um chookum says is a narcissist or

636
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:48,240
psychopath the cause of heavy metals or

637
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:51,120
broken Soul or personality you can have

638
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,799
a combination correct combination I just

639
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:55,100
saw a combination easily can have that

640
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:55,100
yes

641
00:27:55,799 --> 00:28:01,260
crispy perspective over there on YouTube

642
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,700
been feeling so stressed from

643
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:05,340
relationship breakups and

644
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:06,779
disappointments and all acne have

645
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:09,000
sprouted up

646
00:28:06,779 --> 00:28:10,980
Sleep Quality went down so what happens

647
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,380
is when we have relationship problems

648
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:16,919
and we have breakups our immune system

649
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:19,080
drops it drops down when our immune

650
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:22,200
system drops down what happens you guys

651
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:25,500
is that when it drops down other things

652
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:27,360
rise up so our immune system

653
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:29,100
other things could rise up what are

654
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:31,440
other things well streptococcus that's

655
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:33,960
behind acne

656
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:36,179
other things can rise up UTIs straight

657
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:38,100
that strap that streptococcal and UTIs

658
00:28:36,179 --> 00:28:41,000
boom

659
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:41,000
it's another one too

660
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:45,539
fatigue can start up after breakups

661
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:47,220
because immune system lowers and then

662
00:28:45,539 --> 00:28:49,700
everybody's Epstein bar just starts to

663
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:49,700
rise up

664
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:59,340
sometimes a person's soul injury

665
00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:01,380
and resulting emotional state isn't a

666
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:03,059
physical problem yet symptoms often take

667
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:06,000
time to build quietly in the background

668
00:29:03,059 --> 00:29:08,279
so a soul injury at an earlier time in

669
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,380
life could be the trigger for future

670
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:12,720
symptoms of full-blown conditions to

671
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:14,940
come we're talking about that now if you

672
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:17,159
don't have the right knowledge and tools

673
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:19,380
and resources to take care of your soul

674
00:29:17,159 --> 00:29:22,640
and physical body we can get in trouble

675
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:22,640
that's how it works

676
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:28,679
let's be clear emotional wounds and soul

677
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,940
wounds are not the reason for physical

678
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:34,620
suffering

679
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:36,600
big triggers though big triggers

680
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:38,940
for underlying susceptibilities which

681
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:41,159
everybody has

682
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:42,720
which are caused by pathogens poisons

683
00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:45,000
were up against in the world and heavy

684
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:48,299
metals that's an example it's a poison

685
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:50,700
but you are not weak you are not weak

686
00:29:48,299 --> 00:29:52,679
regardless and you're not weak just

687
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:54,539
because you're chronically sick you're

688
00:29:52,679 --> 00:29:57,179
still not weak strongest people I've

689
00:29:54,539 --> 00:29:59,279
ever seen and let me go into this part

690
00:29:57,179 --> 00:30:02,659
this is important please if you guys

691
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:02,659
have a second to listen to this

692
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,179
you know how

693
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:08,279
strong

694
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:09,419
people who have chronic illness really

695
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:13,159
are

696
00:30:09,419 --> 00:30:13,159
people who have been sick for years

697
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,159
they're strong

698
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:21,960
I can guarantee you

699
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:25,260
that if you take someone who's an

700
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:27,600
athlete maybe a professional athlete in

701
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:30,899
football or basketball or

702
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:34,580
professional swimmer or something right

703
00:30:30,899 --> 00:30:34,580
and they get chronic illness

704
00:30:35,399 --> 00:30:40,620
screaming like a baby

705
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:42,600
screaming and screaming like a baby

706
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:45,539
can't handle it for more than six months

707
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:47,039
can't handle it for more than two months

708
00:30:45,539 --> 00:30:48,960
there's people out there who are

709
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:50,640
chronically sick for five six years bent

710
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,620
every doctor been to everything they've

711
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,840
been through hell and back but they're

712
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:57,299
strong really strong they may not seem

713
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:59,220
strong they can't run a marathon but

714
00:30:57,299 --> 00:31:00,720
then you take somebody who's been strong

715
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:02,700
their whole life

716
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:05,659
they run marathons and everything and

717
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:09,299
they finally get sick they are

718
00:31:05,659 --> 00:31:11,460
screaming bloody murder

719
00:31:09,299 --> 00:31:13,260
because they can't take it for a minute

720
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:15,360
because it's it's stopping them from

721
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:17,100
doing what they want to do and and feel

722
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:19,799
and be indestructible and they can't

723
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:21,539
handle it there's it's amazing how it

724
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:24,000
works the most

725
00:31:21,539 --> 00:31:25,919
strongest people I've ever known are

726
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,620
people that have been through it and

727
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:31,500
they understand and they've been sick

728
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:33,360
clear done on YouTube says Bend to hell

729
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:35,580
and back you bet

730
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:39,000
on IG

731
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:41,460
fearing fearing a woman says I've lost

732
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:44,100
my husband July 4th and I can't eat

733
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:46,020
sleep or manage to have the energy to do

734
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:47,820
anything in the house all I do is cry

735
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:49,740
and mourn

736
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:52,220
God bless you I'm so sorry you're going

737
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:52,220
through that

738
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:01,440
a person with a soul injury is

739
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:03,539
vulnerable

740
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:05,820
if you ever hear a friend say I'm not

741
00:32:03,539 --> 00:32:09,059
ready for another relationship

742
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:11,640
I'm still hurting from my breakup

743
00:32:09,059 --> 00:32:14,399
she's acknowledging that her soul needs

744
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:17,520
time to heal before the risks

745
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:20,520
of putting herself into the firing line

746
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:23,460
again right so a lot of people

747
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:27,980
you know their Soul's been injured you

748
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:27,980
know they've been hurt

749
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:31,740
and they're like I can't I can't get

750
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:33,659
into another relationship I can't start

751
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:36,240
another relationship

752
00:32:33,659 --> 00:32:39,419
I'm not ready because I can't handle it

753
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:41,640
because I've been hurt really bad and I

754
00:32:39,419 --> 00:32:43,860
need to be careful and I need to take my

755
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:46,460
time and I need to do some healing and

756
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:46,460
rebuilding

757
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:51,299
along the same lines if you've ever

758
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:53,460
observed someone who's sick with

759
00:32:51,299 --> 00:32:56,159
symptoms or a condition and hasn't been

760
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:58,260
able to find answers you may see this

761
00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:00,360
person hungrily pursuing spiritual

762
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:02,520
learning in any form religion spiritual

763
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:05,100
gurus self-help books meditation

764
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:07,620
Retreats breath work it's likely because

765
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:10,799
that person's soul has been injured from

766
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:13,320
all of the trust lost along the way and

767
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:15,600
he or she is instinctively searching for

768
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:18,380
ways to make the soul healthy and

769
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,380
complete again

770
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:25,279
it's incredible information Marie says

771
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:25,279
which book is this

772
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:32,519
which page am I on

773
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:35,519
page 394

774
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:35,519
394.

775
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:44,460
sometimes soul-searching will bring

776
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:46,140
people closer to themselves many times

777
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:49,559
it will leave them feeling more lost

778
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:51,899
than ever under the guise of help

779
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:54,000
you may have heard the false theory that

780
00:33:51,899 --> 00:33:55,919
illness is just a cry for attention have

781
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,080
you ever heard that where you're just

782
00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:00,179
crying for attention you're not sick

783
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:03,299
you were never sick you're crying for

784
00:34:00,179 --> 00:34:04,860
attention you're asking for help you're

785
00:34:03,299 --> 00:34:06,480
asking for attention because you're not

786
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:08,700
sick

787
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:10,740
you may have heard the false theory that

788
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:12,359
illness is just a cry for attention you

789
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:15,060
may have heard that when bad things

790
00:34:12,359 --> 00:34:16,919
happen to us we cause them by thinking

791
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:19,919
the wrong thoughts or that someone

792
00:34:16,919 --> 00:34:22,800
something about who you are as a person

793
00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:24,359
is wrong you've heard that too right you

794
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,800
caused your illness that's what you hear

795
00:34:24,359 --> 00:34:27,419
out there that's what a lot of people

796
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:29,820
talk about it's spiritual movement it's

797
00:34:27,419 --> 00:34:32,280
really bad I have to be honest

798
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:33,659
that's the one thing actually one out of

799
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:36,119
many things in the spiritual movement

800
00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:37,520
out there that I I think is really

801
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:40,619
messed up

802
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:42,119
anna-lysa Phipps says Anthony is there a

803
00:34:40,619 --> 00:34:44,820
way to tell when you're dealing with

804
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:47,399
pure evil versus brain toxins

805
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:49,800
there definitely is pure evil out there

806
00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:52,440
I will not

807
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:53,700
deny that

808
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:56,520
I don't know if you ever hear my

809
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:58,920
telegram messages ever have you guys

810
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:01,320
are you guys on my Telegram

811
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:02,760
page

812
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,780
I don't know if you ever heard me talk

813
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:05,220
on there

814
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:06,720
it's a lot of fork tongue out there

815
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:08,760
there's a lot of dark

816
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:11,820
Ness out there's a lot of people that

817
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:13,220
have obviously dark intentions there's a

818
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:16,520
lot of Darkness out there in the world

819
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:16,520
it's true

820
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:19,980
if we walk around and pretend there is

821
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:21,720
no darkness and we walk around and

822
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:23,880
pretend there's nothing dark out there

823
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:26,640
going on

824
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:28,800
if we walk out if we walk around and

825
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:30,540
pretend nothing bad's happening or

826
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,460
really in some kind of crazy bubble

827
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:34,440
because that's not reality

828
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:36,660
and another thing too not everything is

829
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:38,339
a lesson

830
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:40,859
to be learned

831
00:35:38,339 --> 00:35:42,119
meaning when darkness occurs right it's

832
00:35:40,859 --> 00:35:43,980
not that you're supposed to learn a

833
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:46,140
lesson because darkness is attacking you

834
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:48,420
it's not really that you're trying to go

835
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:52,760
about your business and do good things

836
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:52,760
in in life and then Darkness attacks

837
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:59,280
a lot of people are told that they cause

838
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:00,660
their illness upon themselves so in the

839
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:02,400
spiritual movement I see that a lot and

840
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:05,040
I'm like what

841
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:07,140
oh yeah you manifested that sickness you

842
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:09,119
must be manifesting wrong that's why

843
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:10,619
you're sick you've been to 20 doctors

844
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:13,320
and you got neurological problems and

845
00:36:10,619 --> 00:36:14,820
Tremors and fatigue and your eyes are

846
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:17,400
twitching and you've got all kinds of

847
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:20,040
different problems you must have you

848
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:22,200
must have done that to yourself through

849
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:23,940
manifestation you must have manifested

850
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:26,220
wrong bad thoughts or something like

851
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:27,660
that maybe you're just a bad person and

852
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:29,040
you need lots of spiritual growth and

853
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:32,000
that's why you have all those crazy

854
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:32,000
neurological symptoms

855
00:36:32,099 --> 00:36:37,380
because you brought it on yourself

856
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,660
you hear that that's terrible because

857
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:42,560
that's not correct Michelle

858
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:42,560
Ulrich says aw

859
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:49,260
I was a competitive bodybuilder and ran

860
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:51,540
half marathons that's incredible when I

861
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:53,700
got my autoimmune diagnosis I completely

862
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:55,320
healed from the symptoms after

863
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:59,099
discovering medical medium information

864
00:36:55,320 --> 00:37:02,220
it took two and a half years God bless

865
00:36:59,099 --> 00:37:06,680
you Michelle proud of you too you stuck

866
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:06,680
to it even with all the BS out there

867
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:12,420
the lies that are out there about

868
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:15,420
medical medium the amount of negativity

869
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:18,000
the amount of discrimination

870
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:20,099
because I hear a voice the amount of all

871
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:25,040
of that and you've hung in there for two

872
00:37:20,099 --> 00:37:25,040
and a half years despite all of that BS

873
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:29,060
and cancel culture

874
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:35,820
and also what is it called a competitor

875
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:37,320
competitor attacks and takedowns out

876
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:38,880
there

877
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:40,380
because they don't like the fact that

878
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:43,619
medical medium is in the health space

879
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:45,180
offering free stuff 24 7 including tons

880
00:37:43,619 --> 00:37:46,619
of information for people to heal so

881
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:48,000
competitors are trying to knock out

882
00:37:46,619 --> 00:37:50,099
medical medium

883
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,560
and medical medium health health space

884
00:37:50,099 --> 00:37:53,579
right even with all that going on and

885
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:56,460
you hung in there for two and a half

886
00:37:53,579 --> 00:37:59,339
years incredible

887
00:37:56,460 --> 00:38:01,020

888
00:37:59,339 --> 00:38:04,500

00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:15,480
recognize it for what it is how'd you

893

know it's the past three years

894
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:22,140
you are definitely tuned in to the lies

895
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:25,099
and the garbage that's been out there

896
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:25,099
interesting

897
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:29,640
yep

898
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:31,440
I'm going to talk more about it when I

899
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:33,780
get a chance

900
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:36,359

901
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:37,980

again if you are ill or going through a

907
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:54,300
trial like a divorce or a loss you did

911
00:39:01,859 --> 00:39:06,420

to happen to you or something

919
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:23,400
challenging to happen to you it's not

920
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:25,619
what you're doing

921
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:28,820

00:39:25,619 --> 00:39:28,820
manifest hardship

923
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:38,460

934
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:05,280

957
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:20,400
your heart serves as the compass for

958
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:22,980
your actions guiding you to do the right

959
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:25,200
thing when your soul becomes lost you

960
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:27,000
can have a busted up soul you can have a

961
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:28,380
soul that's been through hell and back

962
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,140
you could have a soul that feels

963
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:33,780
fractured you can feel like whoa there's

964
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:37,680
nothing left for me to give anymore I

965
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:40,940
can't give any more I can't right you

966
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:40,940
can be at that place

967
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:47,040
and your heart

968
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:50,640
will be the compass your heart will

969
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:52,680

because even if your soul is busted up

973
00:41:57,060 --> 00:42:03,619
pretty bad and you feel pretty down and

974
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:06,420
you feel pretty beaten down

975
00:42:03,619 --> 00:42:09,540
your heart will then become that compass

976
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:12,540
and help guide you the direction you

977
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:15,300
need to be guided

Alexandra Sophia says the heart's

979
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:19,700
guidance is always right on point

980
00:42:25,859 --> 00:42:31,140
your heart is also a kind your your

981
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:33,599
heart

982
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:36,599
is also a safety net

983
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:39,060
that can compensate for soul injury this

984
00:42:36,599 --> 00:42:41,339
means you can have a tattered soul and a

985
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:43,440
warm loving heart how many people out

986
00:42:41,339 --> 00:42:46,380
there have a warm loving heart

987
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:47,700
regardless of all the crap they went

988
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:49,980
through

989
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:54,000
how many people have that where they

990
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:56,280
still have a warm loving heart

991
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,319
no matter what how much they've gone

992
00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:01,200
through no matter how much trust was

993
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:04,680
broken no much no matter what occurred

994
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:06,180
betrayal they still have a kind loving

995
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:08,460
heart

996
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:10,740
I never give up on people

997
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:13,440
I never give up on people

998
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:17,579
even if I there's

999
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:19,859
then say stabbed in the back by somebody

1000
00:43:17,579 --> 00:43:21,300
that I know

1001
00:43:19,859 --> 00:43:23,339
because

1002
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:25,880
they wanted something out of me and I

1003
00:43:23,339 --> 00:43:25,880
said no

1004
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:29,700
even with something like that I still

1005
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:31,140
don't go on the next day saying I'm

1006
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:33,420
never going to trust a single person

1007
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:34,920
again after that

1008
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:37,920
I don't do that

1009
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:41,040
I trust again and I trust again and I

1010
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:43,079
trust again that's what I do and I keep

1011
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:46,220
trusting and I keep on moving forward

1012
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:46,220
that's what I do

1013
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:53,460
when your soul suffers fractures and

1014
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:54,359
losses a strong heart will get you

1015
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:58,079
through

1016
00:43:54,359 --> 00:44:00,720
with Selfless Love compassion and joy

1017
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:02,700
until your soul has managed to heal it's

1018
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:05,579
like the heart takes over your heart

1019
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:07,140
takes over while your soul is healing

1020
00:44:05,579 --> 00:44:11,420
I like that

1021
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:11,420
I love that it comes from the heart

1022
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:20,400

light blast that's why we're doing the

1047
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:28,619
collecting Stones meditation Journey

1048
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:32,339
Hannah T says why does God send people

1049
00:45:28,619 --> 00:45:35,040
into our Lives who keep betraying us

1050
00:45:32,339 --> 00:45:37,980
is our job to give people chances over

1051
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:41,700
and over love unconditionally

1052
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:45,800
look I'll tell you something

1053
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:45,800
it's not God doing that

1054
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:55,880
you guys are incredible it's been an

1055
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,880
honor

1056
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:01,980
renata144aw if the heart is hurt can

1057
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:04,700
that block someone from tuning in with

1058
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:04,700
their intuition

1059
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:09,960
it's the heart emotionally hurt

1060
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:11,880
physically hurt

1061
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:13,859
two different things

1062
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:15,720
but our heart either way is still that

1063
00:46:13,859 --> 00:46:20,480
Beacon no matter what even if it's

1064
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:20,480
injured physically it's still the beacon

1065
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:24,079
kind of Lights the way

1066
00:46:24,359 --> 00:46:29,520
now there are people out there that have

1067
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:33,599
cold dark Hearts I mean that does exist

1068
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:35,220
where they have cold dark hearts

1069
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:37,740
there is that term heartless and it

1070
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:40,079
actually is real unfortunately there are

1071
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:43,280
some heartless people out there it

1072
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:43,280
exists on this planet

1073
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:51,619
Darkness can take over people and

1074
00:46:47,819 --> 00:46:51,619
completely corrupt their heart

1075
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:57,660
and then genocide occurs

1076
00:46:55,619 --> 00:47:00,200
in so many different levels on so many

1077
00:46:57,660 --> 00:47:00,200
different ways

1078
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:03,859
in so many different ways

1079
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:09,000
so that does happen there's some evil

1080
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:11,280
people on the planet and then toxic

1081
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:14,099
heavy metals can affect people too

1082
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:17,819
in so many different ways

1083
00:47:14,099 --> 00:47:21,780
but even with that really there are just

1084
00:47:17,819 --> 00:47:24,900
some serious evil people on the planet

1085
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:27,780
that do just heartless cruel things and

1086
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:30,540
Despicable things

1087
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:35,180
it's horrible and don't have a care in

1088
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:35,180
the world about human race or suffering

1089
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:46,500
this has really been an incredible

1090
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:47,760
um fun discussion you guys

1091
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:49,680
so I just want to give you one more

1092
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:53,240
reminder don't miss out on the

1093
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:53,240
collecting Stones meditation Journey

1094
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:57,780
as you clean up your body physically

1095
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:59,880
with for example like the medical medium

1096
00:47:57,780 --> 00:48:02,160
tools cleans up people's bodies

1097
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:04,020
physically intuition gets stronger and

1098
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:06,720
stronger and stronger

1099
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:09,200
intuition gets stronger and stronger and

1100
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:09,200
stronger

1101
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:14,780
and then these Revelations and then

1102
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:19,380
these epiphanies and then these

1103
00:48:14,780 --> 00:48:23,520
realizations come and then

1104
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:27,300
incredible references occur

1105
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:29,700
but people also have free will

1106
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:31,920
and they can be persuaded and

1107
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:33,900
brainwashed very easily out there so

1108
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:36,119
people have free will

1109
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:39,780
and Free Will can

1110
00:48:36,119 --> 00:48:41,700
be the greatest thing ever

1111
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:45,920
and it can also get us in trouble of

1112
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:45,920
course and we can be persuaded

1113
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:53,359
seeing interesting comments from you

1114
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:53,359
guys everywhere

1115
00:48:53,579 --> 00:48:57,660
the thing is is that with Spirit of

1116
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:58,560
compassion I tend to ask a lot of

1117
00:48:57,660 --> 00:49:01,440
questions

1118
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:05,520
to SOC and

1119
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:07,800
I could probably do just in 10 hour live

1120
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:10,680
every day

1121
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:15,740
and we can go into places that

1122
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:15,740
answer a lot of questions spiritual wise

1123
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:20,300
and it would be mind-blowing

1124
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:24,960
but I'll try to get it all in the

1125
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:27,859
spiritual book if I could ever get to it

1126
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,859
I love you guys

1127
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:32,280
and uh
