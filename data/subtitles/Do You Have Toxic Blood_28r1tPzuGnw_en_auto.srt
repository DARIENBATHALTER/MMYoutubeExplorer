and you want people to cleanse but the

105
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:49,280
body doesn't work like that i've learned

106
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:51,120
that the body cleanses itself you just

107
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,519
have to eat in moderation you have to

108
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,920

109
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,159
i was like uh-huh okay my eyes were kind

110
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,480

112
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,560
actually like they were like starting to

113
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,519
roll over i was flickering my eyes were

114
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:10,400
flickering and i was like okay tell me

115
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:13,120
tell me like yeah and you just have to

116
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,760
exercise and then everybody's body

117
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,880
handles itself on its own and i said

118
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,079
listen

119
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:22,960
i've heard that before many times

120
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:25,120
but what are your patients like well

121
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,960
they got all kinds of problems mr

122
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,800
william they come in here sick with

123
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,639
everything and i'm scratching my head

124
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,320
and i go okay well do you think they

125
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,199
need to cleanse a little

126
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,160
well

127
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,160
no

128
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,560
their bodies handle that well then how's

129
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,840
their body handling anything on its own

130
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,840
when they're coming in there they're

131
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,759
like the walking dead coming in there

132
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,440

134
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,680

135
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,680
people have all these

136
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,840
horrendous skin conditions some people

have depression so bad some people have

138
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,560
all these problems i go yeah and do you

139
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:01,120
think there's something inside of them

140
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,199
that needs to come out that shouldn't be

141
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,759
there well i don't really know what that

142
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,840
could be maybe it's climate change mr

143
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,600
william do you think it's climate change

144
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,720
that's causing problems with all my

145
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,520
patients

146
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,520

00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,080
you been reading i said to her what have

196
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,599
you been reading because guess what up

197
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,280
until the medical medium book series

198
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:09,599
nobody knew epstein-barr caused one

199
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,759
symptom

200
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:14,240
yeah well i thought i saw an article

201
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:15,919
that they say now that science study

202
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,479
recently came out that it's linked to

203
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:20,880
maybe a thyroid problem i go yeah and

204
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:23,840
that was medical medium book one

205
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:26,000
yes it was linked to a thyroid problem

206
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,840
yes you're just regurgitating

207
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,919
information that came from the book

208
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:33,360
originally oh i guess that must be why

209
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:33,360
the doctor wants to talk to you

210
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,039
the thing is you guys what's happening

211
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,960
out there by the way listen i'm going to

212
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,400
be juicing some pomegranate seeds

213
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:43,759
because

214
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:45,840
you need antioxidants to battle what's

215
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:48,240
happening inside the blood you need

216
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,000
phytochemical compounds

217
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,639
the

218
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,120
anti-juicing people out there

219
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:57,520
are really ridiculous at this point oh

220
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,520
no juicing is not good you need to just

221
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,039
use a blender or a bullet because you

222
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,720
want to preserve everything in there

223
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:05,199
okay real smart

224
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,400
because it doesn't do the trick it's not

225
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,879
enough

226
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,400
almost says so no burning wood the

227
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:13,360
burning wood thing

228

home i completely understand

340
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:12,800
but most people don't have to burn wood

341
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:15,279
to heat their home they burn wood

342
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:17,360
and poison everybody else

343
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:18,480
in the neighborhood and everywhere else

344
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,240
and the stuff just goes in the

345
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,560
atmosphere

346

celebrities right you see some

502
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:08,400
celebrities like when they're 20 years

504
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,520
later and their heads are like twice the

505
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:15,840
size like what happened

506
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,840
from being toxic for too many years

507
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:21,679
toxic for too many years toxic blood

508
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:23,600
does some crazy ass in the body

509
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:26,320
that's what toxic blood does it does

510
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:28,799
some crazy ass in the body that's

511
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:31,440
what toxic blood does i mean it's really

512
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:33,679
incredible how it works right

513
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,840
but no no no you don't need to cleanse

514
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:38,240
no you don't need to cleanse you guys

515
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:40,080
just eat a balanced diet whatever you

516
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,000
think is balanced let's do that let's

517
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,280
trust everybody on what they think is

518
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,799
balance

519
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,799
right we can do that

520
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,039
yeah

521
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:55,039
it's not fat i'm talking about their

522
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:56,880
heads don't explode because of fat you

523
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:59,039
need to know that that's part of it

524
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,400
because the brain does gather fat so

525
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:02,799
there's too much fat in the brain

526
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:06,960
meaning additional fat but it's not just

527
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:08,559
about its swelling they got so toxic

528
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:12,400
that their head

529
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:15,200
swelled up it's swollen their head got

530
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:18,480
so swollen that it enlarged that's why

531
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:20,640
the person's head is twice the size or a

532
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:23,760
third size bigger or a quarter size

533
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:27,120
bigger than it was back 20 30 years ago

534
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:29,840
because the swelling became so chronic

535
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:32,400
that the head had to make room for it so

536
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:34,960
the head had to expand like the whole

537
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:40,240
head expanded to make room for that

538
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:40,240
swelling that's from toxic blood right

539
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:46,240

00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:37,440
don't know what's going on but we just

560
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:38,400
turn into a toxic mess as the decades go

561
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,320
by

562
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,679
and that's what happens

563
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,919
you guys

564
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:46,400
and that's what happens

565
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:47,440
frederick says wouldn't it be

566
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,240
head

567
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:52,240
lymphatics too

568
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,320
lymphatic system runs through your head

569
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:57,039
not all of your head but it runs through

570
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,799
a part of it yeah that swells up too

571
00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:00,159
being toxic

572
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:02,720
absolutely

573
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:05,120
but it's more than that your spinal

574
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:08,480
fluid becomes toxic

575
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:10,880
your spinal fluid becomes toxic that's

576
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:13,280
two that's the one there too

577
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,039
you got no room for the spinal fluid

578
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:17,919
anymore

579
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:21,440
the spinal fluid gets full of so many

580
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:23,679
poisons and toxins it slowly graduates

581
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:26,320
into everything needs to make room and

582
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:28,159
that person's head is now so big

583
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,720
compared to what it used to be 30 years

584
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:32,880
ago their head is big now

585
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,840
but they stopped growing 30 years ago

586
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:38,559
but their head swelled up

587
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:40,400
because of the spinal fluid too it's not

588
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:42,799
just lymph lymph it's just this much of

589
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:45,039
it spinal fluid is a big part of it and

590
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:47,840
then there's other stuff too and blood

591
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:50,080
is the really big part of it blood being

592
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:52,960
toxic for so long that your blood

593
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:56,880
vessels just start to swell everything

594
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:58,799
expands even your skull starts to expand

595
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,480
and then it weakens

596
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:03,520
so then you're walking along and you're

597
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:06,080
60 years old you're walking along right

598
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:08,240
oh and you slip down and then boom you

599
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,600
crack your head the doctor's like i

600
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,200
don't know how that happened you

601
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,840
shouldn't have cracked your head open

602
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,840
from that fall

603
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,880

years i know you guys are but i've been

617
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,320
trying to get people to juice for 35

years for no reason at all no you don't

619

need a juice i'm just doing it

620
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,120
cindy says what would you see in a live

621
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:54,799
blood analysis if you had toxic blood

622
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,480
nothing because you would see nothing in

623
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:58,880
a live blood analysis because they don't

624
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,480
know what toxins are looking for

625
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,720
the only thing you can see in the blood

626
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:05,200
is what you're actually you can look for

627
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:07,520
what you can actually look for

628
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,400
they can't look for a metal on a live

629
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,960
analysis

630
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,720
they can't see it they can't look for

631
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,559
air freshener chemicals in a live

632
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:17,280
analysis they can't look for scented

633
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:19,600
candle poisons in a live analysis they

634
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:21,760
can't look for smoke you breathe in from

635
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,840
somebody's chimney next door all night

636
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:27,440
long sifting in through your apartment

637
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:29,200
in your house they can't see any of that

638
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:32,159
they can't

639
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,520
and that's one of the problems

640
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:35,840
blood tests

641
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,960
are all antiquated

642
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:39,440
live blood

643
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:42,080
um test analysis live blood analysis are

644
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:44,400
not even they're antiquated too so

645
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,799
everything's antiquated right so you got

646
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,640

say we don't have to cleanse i went to a

663
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:15,200
health professional and they said you

664
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,640
don't have to cleanse you hear that we

665
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,840
don't have to cleanse right now right we

666
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,840
don't have to cleanse

667
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:24,000
and then

668
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:25,840
you're good until you're not

669
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,400
everything's okay

670
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:30,640
until it's not

671
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:33,120
you're healthy

672
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:35,440
until you're not

673
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:38,240
the whole bit frederick says the problem

674
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:40,480
is metal in the organs though not the

675
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,880
blood right correct

676
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:45,600
there's still some metal in the blood

677
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:48,320
but it settles in the organs

678
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:50,880
sits in the organs and rots frederick

679
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:53,760
spot on that's exactly the information

680
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,760
the metal sits

681
00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:01,279
and the metal sits in the liver too

682
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:04,159
builds up builds up builds up and then

683
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:06,960
kind of releases a little bit

684
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:08,960
right so it does releases a little bit

685
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,840
gets to the brain and then sits in the

686
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:13,520
brain and builds up and builds up

687
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,520
sometimes there's some highway in

688
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:18,559
between

689
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,559
but it builds up

690
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:24,159
just eating moderation

691
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:26,799
i'm gonna have more cow

692
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:28,720

693
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:30,960
well it's moderation i'm gonna have a

694
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:33,279
big burger every night a grass-fed beef

695
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,120
burger every single night

696
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:36,960
i'm not anti-animal protein i'm not

697
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:39,039
anti-vegan you can same thing with

vegans i'm gonna have five more avocados

699
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:42,400
tonight the liver gets stagnant and

700
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,640
sluggish

701
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,640
and then it spills out the poison after

702
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,080
a while it gets stagnant and sluggish

703
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,440
it's your filter and it can't filter

704
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,279
anymore so your liver can't filter

705
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,279
anymore and it's spilling out the poison

706
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:54,960
now because it can't filter anymore so

707
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:57,200
your liver is just spilling out poison

708
00:25:54,960 --> 00:26:00,240
because it can't filter anymore there's

709
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:02,480
no way it can filter anymore

710
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,480
and that's what happens with the liver

711
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,080
right

712
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,760
and then we don't know what to do and

713
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:10,000
you can't change the filter let me just

714
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:11,600
go change the filter

715
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,360
let me do that

716
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,880
it's like i'm gonna go to a clinic and

717
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,840
they're gonna change my filter hold on

718
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,320

719
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:20,880
just gonna get my filter replaced here

720
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:23,600
you can't change this filter

721
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:26,159
it's not changeable you have to cleanse

722
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:27,200
it we have to get a juice in us once in

723
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:28,480
a while

724
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,480
it's not

725
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,520
we're up against things we've never been

726
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,679
up again

727
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:36,320
against ever before in our history we're

728
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:37,760
up against more poison more problems

729
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:40,559
than we've ever been up against in our

730
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:43,360
history we can't just change our filter

731
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:45,679
we have to clean it we have to clean it

732
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:47,120
you guys there's new chemicals man

733
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:48,480
there's new chemicals every day they're

734
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,080
making

735
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,279
the chemical

736
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,120
industry

737
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:55,279
is sitting there

738
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:57,039
making a new chemical

739
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:58,159
every day

740
00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:00,480
right

741
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:02,400
it never gets tested

742
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,360
they don't know if it can kill you or

743
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,960

okay

753
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,880
and

754
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,720
these things build up our system for

755
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,000
years and years and years

756
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:35,200
they do

757
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,200
let's do some juicing

758
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,960
it's critical so what i'm going to do is

759
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,159
look i'll run a little bit of celery

760
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,640
through here i think that's what i want

761
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,640
to do now

762
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:50,880
what i love about celery

763
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,640
they said nobody's drinking it you know

764
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,640
what i love about celery i'm gonna be a

765
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:57,520
little sarcasm here right no one's

766
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,960
shrinking it nobody all right

767
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,240
no one wants to talk about it because no

768
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,240
one's drinking it

769
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,399
youtubers stop talking about it because

770
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,000
no one's drinking it no one's drinking

771
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:07,440
celery at all

772
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,279
meanwhile

773
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,720
a couple of the biggest corporations and

774
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:13,039
food on the planet are putting out

775
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:15,440
celery juices pretty soon

776
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:17,919
because the whole world's drinking it

777
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:20,159
it's going to be more popular than soda

778
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:22,720
down the road right

779
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:24,320
and because everybody is drinking it

780
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:26,399
and a lot of people are just hiding that

781
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:28,320
they drink it every single juice bar

782
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:30,399
it's their number one drink

783
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:32,399
every single juice bar on the planet

784
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:36,320
right now sells more celery juice than

785
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:36,320
anything single juice there is

786
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,320
there's more celery juice in the

787
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,159
supermarkets being sold you know the

788
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:45,600
fake ones with the hpp not the fresh

789
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:48,799
ones every single day it is the largest

790
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:51,039
crop in produce on the planet they can't

791
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:54,960
grow enough of it

792
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:57,039
thousands of farms every single day

793
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:59,279
are being like are putting this stuff

794
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:01,760
out you don't want hpp what i love about

795
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:06,080
doing it this way

796
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:08,320
it's this isn't hpp you guys hpp is no

797
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:11,440
good for me

798
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:14,399
hpp is high pressure past graduation you

799
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,600
can't use high pressure pasteurization

800
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:17,760
with

801
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:20,480
celery juice

802
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:22,720
you can't do hpp it can't be high

803
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,399
pressure pasteurization because i'll

804
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:27,520
tell you what that is

805
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:29,440
it kills the phytochemical compounds so

806
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:32,399
you can get healthy

807
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:34,559
yes stay away from hpp

808
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:36,399
you know what you can probably drink

809
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:38,480
something in hpp

810
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:40,799
and it'd be okay

811
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:42,080
but not celery juice it has to be juiced

812
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:44,000
fresh

813
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:46,640

way possible so that's what i want

931
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:15,839
that's what it's about okay

932
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:17,280
so i'm gonna strain this celery juice

933
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:18,839
for a second well actually what i'm

934
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:21,919
gonna do is show you the pulp

935
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:25,200
right so the pulp is dry

936
00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:27,040
this pulp is not wet and sloppy

937
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:29,040
it's not wet and sloppy

938
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,320
it doesn't have to be put back into the

939
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,480
machine over and over again which

940
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:34,720
doesn't get juice out by the way

941
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:37,040
you can't re-juice pulp

942
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:38,320
it's not possible it comes out the way

943
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:40,240
it's going to come out wet and it's

944
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:41,679
going to stay wet i got a friend that

945
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:43,919
keeps on putting it that they put it

946
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:45,359
back into the machine 100 times and i

947
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:46,560

it back in over and over again and i was

953
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:57,760

why is the pulp still wet the link is in

995
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:16,640
the bio the link is in the description

996
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:17,839
let's talk about toxic blood

997
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,760
and then maybe we're gonna juice some

998
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:21,760
pomegranate because that's incredible

999
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,960
for toxic blood too so we'll do that all

1000
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,480
right

1001
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,680
all right so let's let's string in the

1002
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:29,200
juice

1003
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:31,920
you gotta strain your celery juice

1004
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:33,839
very important to do okay

1005
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:36,400
you have to strain it

1006
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:38,079
you can't add anything to it it's not

1007
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:40,000
gonna work

1008
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:41,760
so you say that the plastic is more safe

1009
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,400
than stainless steel so

1010
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:46,320
no way i don't trust plastics at all

1011
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:48,160
it's fine if you don't trust blast lucas

1012
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:50,240
it's fine okay

1013
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,119
but here's how it works right

1014
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,640
so

1015
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:54,960
metal on metal so let me show you

1016
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:56,800
something i don't have

1017
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:59,359
i don't have

1018
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:02,079

1019
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:05,200
other juicers okay but i'm gonna make

1020
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:05,200
two gears for you

1021
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:10,079
this is not cheap

1022
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:12,079
plastic this is bpa free plastic that

1023
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:13,280
the juice is touching there's a

1024
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:15,599
difference

1025
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:17,920
this is not cheap plastic so that's

1026
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:20,480

you know what metal on metal is

1073
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:08,840
it's like your brake pads hitting your

1074
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,800
rotor and you hear

1075
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:13,599
[Music]

1076
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:16,480
tiny particles of metal are going into

1077
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:19,040
your juice as each month goes by each

1078
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,560

okay

1085
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:36,160
metal

1086
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:38,240
takes a lot to get out of your body

1087
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:40,320
it gets into your organs into your

1088
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:42,400
intestinal lining it gets into your

1089
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:45,440
liver it gets into your brain

1090
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:47,520
metal doesn't come out of the body easy

1091
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:50,640
so here you are you're juicing with your

1092
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:52,800
metal juicers there you go and your one

1093
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:55,119
more year goes by and you're now eating

more metal another year goes by oh i'm

1095
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:59,280
getting healthy i'm drinking my juices

1096
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:00,640
and you're getting more metal eventually

1097
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:03,359
that metal is going to build up in your

1098
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:06,079
liver your brain your intestinal tract

1099
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:06,079
see how it works

1100
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:10,280
that's how it works

1101
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:13,280
and what happens and people don't

1102
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:15,200
realize

1103
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:17,280
is that there's a difference this isn't

1104
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:20,480
cheap plastic

1105
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:22,160
this is high quality technology plastic

1106
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:25,200
bpa free

1107
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:28,240
and any plastic residue from anything

1108
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:31,280
plastic even bad plastics because this

1109
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:32,800
isn't bad plastic bad plastic

1110
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:34,800
still comes out of the body with

1111
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,880
cleansing

1112
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:40,000
your juice

1113
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:41,920
literally can take any plastic you've if

1114
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,400
you ate plastic from fast food

1115
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:46,640
restaurants from 10 years ago and that

1116
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,400
plastic is still in you your juice that

1117
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:50,560
you're juicing from something high

1118
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:52,400
quality like this is taking that plastic

1119
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:54,880
out of your body from 10 years ago but

1120
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,880
get this

1121
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:59,200
you know how hard it is to get metal out

1122
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:01,760
you got to do the medical medium heavy

1123
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:04,560
metal detox smoothie you got to do the

1124
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:07,200
wild blueberry you got it's hard to get

1125
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:09,119
metal out

1126
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:11,520
and here you are with all the different

1127
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:13,920
juicers with all the metal the

1128
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:16,480
centrifuge metal

1129
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:18,000
the the gears of metal

1130
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:19,599
and that's what people don't really

1131
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,520
understand

1132
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:22,720
and guess what someone left a comment on

1133
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,640
youtube

1134
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:26,079
on youtube i think on the last one you

1135
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,680
guys could go look for if you want right

1136
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:29,680
somebody left a comment

1137
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:32,079
saying they were using the metal juicers

1138
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:34,160
for years

1139
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:36,400
and they couldn't get results and then

1140
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:38,319
they switched and they got results

1141
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:40,560
because they were stopping to get metal

1142
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:42,000
poisoned

1143
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:44,160
right

1144
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:47,040
pk good to see you i see you leave

1145
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:48,480
comments every now and youtube

1146
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,839
so the point is

1147
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:52,400
is that you got to think about that and

1148
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:53,839
how that works like the difference

1149
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:56,160
this isn't even about choosing you know

1150
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:59,119
what is this is about information that's

1151
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:01,440
critical when i think about it right

1152
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:04,480
so these are great if the metal gears

1153
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:06,240
were fine i'd be having metal gears man

1154
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:08,800
i'd be like yeah give me the metal gears

1155
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:11,040
give me the metal gears

1156
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:13,040
i'll take the metal gears they're fine

1157
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,839
they're safe why wouldn't i use them

1158
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:15,760
then

1159
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:18,319
you'd see a juicer here with metal gears

1160
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,319
right here

1161
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:22,800
but you're not going to see that

1162
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:25,359
i think i had a little too much celery

1163
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:30,040
for us today

1164
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:30,040

00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:35,280
i took like six celery force before i

1166
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,280
came on today

1167
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:39,440
what happens when i'm trying to pour

1168
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,960
this and the juicer's in the way because

1169
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,560
i'm trying to do it on camera right here

1170
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,839
and i don't want to pour it over there i

1171
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,920
want you guys to be able to see it i end

1172
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:48,000
up spilling a little because

1173
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:50,880
everything's in my way over here

1174
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,880
just bear with me

1175
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:57,040
when you guys pour your juice out try

1176
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:59,359
not to do it jammed up against your

1177
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:01,280
juicer try to pour like try to give

1178
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:04,480
yourself room so you just don't knock it

1179
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:04,480
everywhere like i just did

1180
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:09,520
you want to strain it you don't want to

1181
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:11,119
add lemon you don't want to add anything

1182
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:13,119
you don't want to add water or ice or

1183
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:14,960
nothing into it let the sodium cluster

1184
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:16,240
salts flush out the liver and clean the

1185
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:18,640
body

1186
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:19,920
that's really important to know

1187
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:22,319
okay

1188
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:24,319
blenders don't have metal gears grinding

1189
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:25,440
against each other keep that i saw that

1190
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:29,520
question

1191
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:31,520
blenders don't have metal gears grinding

1192
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:33,760
against each other

1193
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:35,599
so blenders don't have metal gears

1194
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:37,200
grinding against each other i know

1195
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:38,560
someone said well what about the metal

1196
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,079
in a blender

1197
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:42,720
i love answering these questions because

1198
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:44,079

better

1203
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:52,480
is what i want how do you strain your

1204
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:54,800
juice

1205
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:56,960
you just use a strainer i'd use a mesh

1206
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:58,160
strainer right here that's what i do i

1207
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:00,000
use a mesh

1208
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:02,400
strainer is what i do you can do

1209
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,160
different ways of trying to strain it

1210
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:06,400
but it's important to strain it because

1211
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:08,880
celery juice has to be

1212
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:10,880
has to be on its own it has to be by

1213
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:12,560
itself the juice it's an herbal

1214
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:14,880
extraction so what you're looking at

1215
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:17,200

that's what you're looking at

1218
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:24,400
celery

1219
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:27,920
is an herb it's not a vegetable when you

1220
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:32,240
use herbs to heal life changes so what i

1221
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:33,920
love doing i love juicing parsley

1222
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:36,400

parsley in there i love doing parsley

1226
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:44,079
because you're juicing herbs this is an

1227
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:45,040
herb

1228
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:47,599
this is a

1229
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:49,280
herbal medicine maker right here

1230
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:51,839
that's what this is which is really

1231
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:53,200
great let's do some pomegranate seeds

1232
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:54,960

00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:57,760
three minute clean out with this so what

1234
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,760

00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:13,000
talk about toxic blood

1240
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:16,319
we need

1241
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:18,400
antioxidants to stop oxidizing so let's

1242
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:21,440
talk about that right now i think that's

1243
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:21,440
really important okay

1244
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:27,119
everybody's slowly dying

1245
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:31,520
everybody

1246
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:34,319
is slowly dying

1247
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:37,520
on the planet

1248
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:39,920
it's death by a thousand cuts

1249
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:42,640
they poison us

1250
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:44,839
the industry is poisonous

1251
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:49,040
the pharmaceutical companies poison

1252
00:45:44,839 --> 00:45:50,160
us the chemical industries poison us

1253
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:51,680
right

1254
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:54,240
the illumination

1255
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:56,960
flying all the jet planes in the sky

1256
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:58,880
dropping chemicals down on us is

1257
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:01,200
poisoning us

1258
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:02,880
right all the different household

1259
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:05,440
antagonists

1260
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:07,200
that we're actually taking and and doing

1261
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:08,480
and spraying on ourselves and cleaning

1262
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:10,000
supplies and carpet cleaners are

1263
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:11,200
poisoning us

1264
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:14,560
right

1265
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:17,520
the water supplies are poisoning us

1266
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:19,280
the smoke in the air is poisoning us

1267
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:22,000
there's always some pyros that are

1268
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:23,760
purposely paid to like the worst fires

1269
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,839
in the state of california there's

1270
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:28,640
always pyros that are that are paid to

1271
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:30,800
like the worst fires in australia and

1272
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:33,280
everywhere else so everything just burns

1273
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:35,520
down and forests burned down and the

1274
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:37,599
planet just just basically a planet just

1275
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:40,079
declines and all that with all that

1276
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:43,280
smoke right

1277
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:44,560
we go around

1278
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:46,480
and

1279
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:49,359
we slowly die

1280
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:53,760
because of mankind

1281
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:57,119
evil mankind the evil part of it

1282
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:58,400
the evil ones at the top the echelon the

1283
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:01,359
high echelon

1284
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:04,560
they literally want you to die

1285
00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:06,960
slowly so they kill us slowly with all

1286
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,960
of this

1287
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:10,560
and then we're not getting enough

1288
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:13,359
antioxidants

1289
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:15,680
in us to battle it

1290
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:19,200
so we're not getting enough antioxidants

1291
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:19,200
in us to fight

1292
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:24,720
what i love about the juicer or a juicer

1293
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:29,040
forget this juicer

1294
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:31,119
just any juicer you got a juicer use it

1295
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:33,520
any juicer

1296
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:34,800
what i love about the juicing like

1297
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:36,880
juicing

1298
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:39,440
is you're getting something out of the

1299
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:41,520
food you can't do if you just eat the

1300
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:43,280
food and chew it

1301
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:45,760
you can't get enough if you do it this

1302
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:47,280
way we're like you can't get enough that

1303
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:49,280
way

1304
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:52,160
and so and you can't get enough by

1305
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:54,079
saying i'm gonna have a pomegranate here

1306
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,800
do you want to share my pomegranate with

1307
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:55,760
me

1308
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:57,839
right

1309
00:47:55,760 --> 00:48:00,640
i'm dr jonzo and i learned that

1310
00:47:57,839 --> 00:48:01,839
pomegranates are good for you and hey do

1311
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:03,920
you want to share this beautiful

1312
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:05,839
pomegranate with me have a little bit

1313
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:07,839
here have a slice that should be enough

1314
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:09,599
antioxidant for you you don't need more

1315
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:11,680
than that you need my colostrum

1316
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:14,079
supplement

1317
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:16,559
you need more than that you need more

1318
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:17,920
than a little bit of this and a little

1319
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:20,800
bit of that

1320
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:22,960
and a little bit of this you need more

1321
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:24,640
than just a piece of an orange once in a

1322
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:26,720
while you know what i mean you need more

1323
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:28,400
than that

1324
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:31,200
and so what happens is in order to

1325
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:33,839
battle what the death by a thousand cuts

1326
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:35,760
are doing out there and then the health

1327
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:37,599
movement they're doing death by a

1328
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:39,359
thousand cuts to everybody too they're

1329
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:41,119
poisoning everybody with the vinegar

1330
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:42,720
poisoning everybody with the caffeine

1331
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:44,079
the health movement yeah alternate

1332
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:45,920
medicine wants everybody dead on

1333
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:47,680
caffeine they're poisoning everybody

1334
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:49,760
with caffeine you don't believe me

1335
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:51,359
it's true the caffeine industry has

1336
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:53,920
completely taken over the alternative

1337
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:56,480
health industry they own them now

1338
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:58,400
they just want you on caffeine 24 7

1339
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:00,960
right it's there it's death by a

1340
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:04,079
thousand cuts everywhere you guys so if

1341
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:06,720
you don't know how to defend yourself

1342
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:06,720
then what

1343
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:10,559
what are you gonna do

1344
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:14,079
and so what i love about the juicing

1345
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:14,079
it's a way to basically say

1346
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:18,240
yeah no sorry

1347
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:19,839
no

1348
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:22,079
not gonna you know what

1349
00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:24,480
rain all you want on me

1350
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:26,160
chemicals coming out of the sky

1351
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:27,359
because you can't say the term anymore

1352
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:29,520
right

1353
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:31,520
bringing all you want on me

1354
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:34,960
all the dioxins

1355
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:36,559
renal you want on me perfume users

1356
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:38,079
right because there's pesticides and

1357
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:39,359
perfumes they're actually made of

1358
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:41,520
pesticides

1359
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:44,880
rain all you want on me

1360
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:47,599
pharmaceutical tap in the tap water

1361
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:49,760
bring all you want wherever you want

1362
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:51,680
but i'm going to be battling your ass

1363
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:54,559
i'm going to be battling you with

1364
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:56,480
antioxidants antioxidant power because

1365
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:58,240
here's the problem everybody's dying

1366
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:59,280
slowly because they're oxidizing did you

1367
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:01,760
know that

1368
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:04,640
did you know your brain is oxidizing

1369
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:07,359
every day it oxidizes that's why

1370
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:09,440
everybody's brain shrinks that's why

1371
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:12,079
when i talk to my doctor friends who

1372
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:13,920
have worked on cadavers they've cut open

1373
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:15,599
people's heads and they've looked at

1374
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:17,520
brains they're like oh my god that

1375
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:19,680
person's brain is half the size it was

1376
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:24,480
when they were younger what happened

1377
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:26,559
their brain shrunk it oxidized

1378
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:29,440
so what happens is the brain just

1379
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:31,040
reduces in size you get older and did

1380
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:32,720
you know your brain gets empty in the

1381
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:34,640
middle of it did you know when everybody

1382
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:37,040
gets older

1383
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:38,559
they start getting a hollow brain down

1384
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:41,520
in here

1385
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:43,520
a hollow brain they get a gap because as

1386
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:45,920
they get older everything's oxidizing

1387
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:49,119
and being eaten on the inside out we

1388
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:51,440
oxidize so we're all dying slowly here

1389
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:53,200
while they're poisoning us here and no

1390
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:56,319
one's really and then you'll hear you

1391
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:56,319
don't have to juice

1392
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:00,000
just keep a balanced diet

1393
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:07,480

1407
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:41,040
elizabeth right health with liz no one

1408
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:43,200
talks about that no no one talks about

1409
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:46,480
that but you know what's funny liz

1410
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:48,800
on a little personal note right

1411
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:51,680
all i do is bring new information

1412
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:53,760
i mean unless i'm wrong unless i'm wrong

1413
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:55,280
or something and i don't

1414
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:56,960
but i bring new information and new

1415
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:58,800
information every single month every

1416
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:00,720
single week every single year and

1417
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:03,680
someone will still say he doesn't have

1418
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:05,119
any new information like what

1419
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:07,599
what do you think i am the lectin guy

1420
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:10,240
that only has lectin information for the

1421
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:12,319
last 10 years and that's all he has

1422
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:13,839
this is that people don't cite back to

1423
00:52:12,319 --> 00:52:15,200
where the original information comes

1424
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:17,680
from here

1425
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:20,000
so then it doesn't seem like i was the

1426
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:22,400
originator of like these pieces of

1427
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:24,240
information because it's it gets taken

1428
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:26,160
out of here so someone takes it and they

1429
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:30,000
run off with it

1430
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:30,000
and then they go they run run away

1431
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:34,880
it's fine the point is is it doesn't

1432
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:37,200
help others if they don't know where it

1433
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:39,359
all comes from

1434
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:41,200
it's just it's really amazing it's

1435
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:43,200
amazing

1436
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:46,319

00:54:31,359 --> 00:54:36,720
for me because you're gonna then stop

1478
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:38,960
someone else from trying medical medium

1479
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:40,160
and never getting a chance to heal

1480
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:41,760
and it might have been somebody that

1481
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:43,440
wasn't gonna be a dabbler they might

1482
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:45,119
have gone all full in on it and you're

1483
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:46,799
gonna tell them basically don't do

1484
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:48,640
medical medium because i did it for four

1485
00:54:46,799 --> 00:54:52,559
years and it didn't fix me

1486
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:54,319
meanwhile you might have been a dabbler

1487
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:56,960
basically what i'm saying is it's

1488
00:54:54,319 --> 00:54:59,760
perfectly fine to be a dabbler but thank

1489
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:01,280

00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:22,400
full-on they want to go into the

1499
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:24,240
protocols they want to go deep into it

1500
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:27,240
i'm i'm totally there

1501
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:27,240
incredible

1502
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:37,200
amazing

1503
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:43,359
so what i'm doing is pomegranate juice

1504
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:43,359
right now

1505
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:47,440
what i love about the pot what i love

1506
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:49,119
about this juicer i'm just going to give

1507
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:51,920
you a quick run down on the pomegranate

1508
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:51,920
aspect okay

1509
00:55:52,799 --> 00:55:57,839
that comes out bone dry

1510
00:55:56,079 --> 00:55:59,920
i ran a lot of pomegranate seeds through

1511
00:55:57,839 --> 00:56:02,960
there that comes out bone dry

1512
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:03,680
okay so that's that's interesting

1513
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:06,720
so

1514
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:08,640
that's coming out bone dry

1515
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:11,520
but here's the difference here's what no

1516
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:11,520
juicer does

1517
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:17,200
no juicer

1518
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:21,200
juices the seed

1519
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:23,040
they only juice the pulp around the seed

1520
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:25,839
so that's important to know

1521
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:27,760
the mm-900 is the only juicer that

1522
00:56:25,839 --> 00:56:29,359
squeezes the chemical compounds the

1523
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:32,079
fight the antioxidants and phytochemical

1524
00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:33,599
compounds inside the seed

1525
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:35,280
so keep that in mind

1526
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:36,799
that means when you drink pomegranate

1527
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:38,480
juice out there right when you go out

1528
00:56:36,799 --> 00:56:41,200
there and you drink pomegranate juice

1529
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:42,640
you're not drinking all of the benefits

1530
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:45,040
you're only drinking

1531
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:47,200
part of the benefits so when

1532
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:48,319
pomegranate juice is offered to you out

1533
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:50,960
there

1534
00:56:48,319 --> 00:56:53,200
it's only half there

1535
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:54,640
it's not all there

1536
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:56,000
it's kind of like talking to somebody

1537
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:57,520
that's lost their mind you know it's

1538
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,200
like they're not all there right you

1539
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:01,359
ever run into that

1540
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:03,280
bad things happen they got so much they

1541
00:57:01,359 --> 00:57:05,200
got they got all these

1542
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:06,559
medals inside their head

1543
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:07,920
they're getting what people call like

1544
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:09,599
all old-timers but it's really

1545
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:12,000
alzheimer's and they're not all there

1546
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:13,040
it's really sad sad process right which

1547
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,240
happens

1548
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:15,760
it's like the same thing with

1549
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:17,520
pomegranate juice you're drinking

1550
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:20,079
pomegranate juice but only part of it's

1551
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:21,359
there it's not all there it's just not

1552
00:57:20,079 --> 00:57:22,720
there

1553
00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:24,880
and so what happens is with the

1554
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:27,520
pomegranate seed you have to juice the

1555
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:28,720
seed itself and that's how life turns

1556
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:29,920
around

1557
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:32,319
to protect you remember i was talking

1558
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:34,480
about antioxidants battling the you know

1559
00:57:32,319 --> 00:57:38,079
death by a thousand cuts

1560
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:39,440
all juicers need to be strained

1561
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:41,200
all juicers

1562
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:42,960
there's no such thing as well i juiced

1563
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:44,880
with this juicer but why are you

1564
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:46,559
straining yours no actually that's a

1565
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:48,000
technique that all juicers are supposed

1566
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:49,440
you're supposed to strain the juice

1567
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,119
after every juice

1568
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:53,040
any juicer you juiced with doesn't

1569
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:54,880
matter what company what brand

1570
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:58,079
you have to strain

1571
00:57:54,880 --> 00:58:00,240
the juice you have to strain the celery

1572
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:02,079
juice you have to so the celery juice

1573
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:03,839
can work trying to answer questions

1574
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:06,640
while we're doing some fun stuff and

1575
00:58:03,839 --> 00:58:10,000
talking all right

1576
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:12,319
let's pour some pomegranate juice out

1577
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,319
here

1578
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:15,440
there you go

1579
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:20,799
now the difference with this juicer is

1580
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:23,920
you're going to squeeze

1581
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:26,000
much more out of the pomegranate seed

1582
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:27,200
much more you're going to squeeze the

1583
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:30,400
seed

1584
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:32,559
not just the pulp around the seed

1585
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:36,200
so now you've got a whole other level of

1586
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:36,200
medicine right here

1587
00:58:36,319 --> 00:58:40,960
and it's a different color

1588
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:42,400
that's the color pomegranate cheese is

1589
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:43,680
supposed to be

1590
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:45,839
so

1591
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:48,160
keep this in mind if you've ever tried

1592
00:58:45,839 --> 00:58:50,799
pomegranate juice on the shelf

1593
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:52,400
or anywhere else it's supposed to be

1594
00:58:50,799 --> 00:58:54,160
this color

1595
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:55,760
it's not supposed to be the fake color

1596
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:57,839
where it's just

1597
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:59,920
the part there color

1598
00:58:57,839 --> 00:59:03,119
where it's the color of the juice that

1599
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:05,280
was around the pulp right

1600
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:06,640
it's supposed to be the color

1601
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:10,160
of

1602
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:12,880
the juice that was inside the seed

1603
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:15,040
see the seed

1604
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:16,319
there you go

1605
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:17,839
that that's an incredible that's

1606
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:21,280
incredible right there i can't even tell

1607
00:59:17,839 --> 00:59:21,280
you you know when you drink that

1608
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:25,920
and i got it i got and i got to tell you

1609
00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:28,000
something now

1610
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:28,960
just know that the pomegranate seeds you

1611
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:31,280
buy

1612
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:32,720
that are de-seeded meaning the

1613
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:34,480
pomegranate you go to the health food

1614
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:36,640
store go to the grocery store and they

1615
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:38,960
already have them where the seeds are

1616
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:40,799
out of the pomegranate like they used

1617
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:42,400
equipment to get the seeds out of the

1618
00:59:40,799 --> 00:59:44,559
pomegranate

1619
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:46,559
just know that when you buy it that way

1620
00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:48,880
it's been laced

1621
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:51,280
with a preservative

1622
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:53,760
from a chemical company that they give

1623
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:56,559
these food companies to lace them with

1624
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:59,200
as a preservative so

1625
00:59:56,559 --> 01:00:02,720
it's best to buy them this way

1626
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:05,040
if you do buy the seeds by themselves in

1627
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:06,880
the grocery stores because they already

1628
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:08,160
were shelled and the seeds were put into

1629
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:09,839
a package and you're like whoa

1630
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:12,319
pomegranate seeds already done for me

1631
01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:15,839
and you buy the package

1632
01:00:12,319 --> 01:00:15,839
rinse them really well

1633
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:19,760
rinse them really well because they're

1634
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:22,400
sprayed

1635
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:24,960
with a preservative chemical

1636
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:28,480
on them that's why i love making sure

1637
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:31,280
you get them from your pomegranates here

1638
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:33,119
okay cordina says please help

1639
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:34,480
love celery juice but makes me so

1640
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:36,240
nauseous

1641
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:38,640
so

1642
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:39,839
is the astringency so you might be

1643
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:43,520
somebody that doesn't like anything

1644
01:00:39,839 --> 01:00:46,480
bitter would parsley make you nauseous

1645
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:48,480
probably right anything astringent

1646
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:51,920
is that what it is like if someone made

1647
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:51,920
parsley juice you'd probably be like

1648
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:55,280
i can't drink this

1649
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:57,520
right

1650
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:59,359
were you ever nauseous before so your

1651
01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:00,640
whole life so this is something i want

1652
01:00:59,359 --> 01:01:02,880
you to be your own detective were you

1653
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:03,839
ever nauseous before

1654
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:05,359
ever

1655
01:01:03,839 --> 01:01:07,520
with anything like were you nauseous

1656
01:01:05,359 --> 01:01:09,440
last week with some other type of food

1657
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:10,559
were you nauseous yesterday when you had

1658
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:12,480
some dinner

1659
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:14,319
were you nauseous the other day when you

1660
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:16,240
got when you were talking to a friend

1661
01:01:14,319 --> 01:01:17,839
and for some reason you you know

1662
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:20,319
whatever or something's happening like

1663
01:01:17,839 --> 01:01:22,640
were you nauseous anyway

1664
01:01:20,319 --> 01:01:23,760
did you get the point is is did you go

1665
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:25,359
through your whole life you're never

1666
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:26,720
nauseous ever and then you sip some

1667
01:01:25,359 --> 01:01:28,799
celery juice and it was the first time

1668
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:31,280
ever you got nauseous or you're somebody

1669
01:01:28,799 --> 01:01:33,280
that gets nauseous pretty easy and you

1670
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:34,960
can get triggered easy so if you had

1671
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:36,640
something like celery juice because it's

1672
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:38,400
so astringent

1673
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:40,160
and the taste is kind of shocking for

1674
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:41,680
some people it made you nauseous because

1675
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:43,119
you're already somebody that's sensitive

1676
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:45,440
and you actually get nauseous all the

1677
01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:47,760
time i want you to be your own detective

1678
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:50,160
what i would do if i was nauseous from

1679
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:53,280
it i would start with two ounces then

1680
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:54,880
two ounces i would do just two ounces

1681
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:57,359
that would that would be a little little

1682
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:59,680
shot glass two ounces right i'll go get

1683
01:01:57,359 --> 01:02:02,240
a shot glass right now

1684
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:03,280
so if i was somebody that was nauseous

1685
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:06,480
by it

1686
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:09,359
i would start really small

1687
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:12,480
that's what i would do

1688
01:02:09,359 --> 01:02:14,960
so cordina says i do have a sensitive

1689
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:16,799
stomach in general so that's why so it's

1690
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:19,359
it's just because you have a sensitive

1691
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:20,480
stomach in general right

1692
01:02:19,359 --> 01:02:21,280
exactly

1693
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:23,039
so

1694
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:25,520
what i would do if that's the case is i

1695
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:27,839
would take a shot class

1696
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:29,119
and i would just do like one ounce two

1697
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:31,440
ounces

1698
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:33,119
maybe just do that and try that

1699
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:34,799
