00:02:04,119 --> 00:02:09,119
what's happening there let's go into

54
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:12,560
ADHD a little bit okay here's what ADHD

55
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:15,120
isn't it's not genetic and it's not

56
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,879
guess what gut related now if that

57
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,200
pisses you off anything hang around so I

58
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:24,200
can talk about it a little bit okay but

59
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:27,040
ADHD is not gut related it's not coming

60
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:29,000
from the gut it's in the brain that's

61
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,280
where the problem is and there's people

62
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,599
with Messy gut guts and they don't have

63
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:37,120
ADHD messy guts their guts are filled

64
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:40,080

brain problem yeah you better believe it

some good protocols and good things that

85
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:39,599
your gut needs to get it to the brain

86
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:43,200
but your gut isn't the problem that's

is guess what

109
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,919
Mercury

110
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:43,039

114
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:56,240
cerebral midline

115
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:59,280
Canal right there right there right in

116
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,680
the middle smack in the middle right

117
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:05,240
there

118
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:09,039
metal in an early age settling in the

119
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:14,240
midline canal and then and then as you

120
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:17,080
get older it squeezes it squeezes closed

121
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,280
okay so when you're young your midline

122
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:21,720
canals

123
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:24,039
open it's open more it's like this when

124
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,919
you're a child and then as you're

125
00:05:24,039 --> 00:05:28,880
getting older and your brain is

126
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:31,759
developing it starts to close up just

127
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:33,960
like this see and as it's closing up

128
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,080
it's squeezing and holding all that

129
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:39,120
mercury and aluminum that's settled in

130
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:41,000
the midline canal so the goal is to get

131
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,960
that out that's critical if you want to

132
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,639
get rid of ADHD you have to get the

you don't think you do and there's a lot

159
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,400
of aluminum in so many different ways

160
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:55,080
that's just one out of a 100 ways you

00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:57,160
can get aluminum in your system passes

162
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:58,720
down from generation Mercury passes down

163
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,919
from generation to generation to

164
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,960
generation

165
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:04,120
mm

166
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:07,639
info mm

167
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:09,039
info okay what really causes ADHD right

168
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:10,360
is the Mercury and aluminum but check

169
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:13,120
this out you guys settling in the

170
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:15,360
midline canal which divides the brain's

171
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,080
left hemisphere from the right along

172
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,479
with some additional metal sprinkled

173
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:21,240
about like a Christmas tree lighting

174
00:07:19,479 --> 00:07:23,599
like Christmas tree lights sprinkled

175
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:25,479
about throughout the brain just a little

176
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:28,800
bit here a little bit there but the

177
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:31,400
midline canal is the big boy right there

178
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:34,039
that's the problem for so many people

179
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:37,960
the same causes

180
00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:41,440
autism important to know so very

181
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:44,199
important to know same cause as autism

182
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:47,080
the ratio is a little more aluminum and

183
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:49,840
a little less Mercury when it comes down

184
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:52,560
to ADHD saw another person asked what

185
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:56,120
book it is it is the brainsaver book

186
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,919
check it out okay let's go into this

187
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,759
when these Metals take up residents in

188
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:02,560
the midline canal when they live live in

189
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:04,479
here when the Mercury and aluminum live

190
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,919
in here right there the midline canal do

191
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:09,000
you guys see that they block internal

192
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:11,199
Communications within the brains keep

193
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,680
keep in mind what happens is when you

194
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:16,759
have industrialized

195
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:20,080
metal that's in the midline

196
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:21,919
canal it's blocking Communications of

197
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,680
the right hemisphere to the left

198
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,919
hemisphere Communications that are

199
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,800
critical all right so there's so much

200
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:29,599
science and research doesn't know about

201
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:32,240
the brain yet and about how the

202
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:35,599
communication goes the electrical grid

203
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:38,519
the supernatural grid is actually

204
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:41,680
unknown to medical research in science

205
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:44,680
communication that the brain has okay

206
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:47,640
meaning like neurons talking to neurons

207
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:51,040
and then the s Supernatural forces

208
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:53,480
involved with neurons talking to neurons

209
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:56,360
and then the energy fields and then the

210
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:58,680
energy exchange the frequencies the

211
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:00,680
vibrations everything that is in here

212
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,480
along with the the soul because that's a

213
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:04,959
whole another aspect of it the soul

214
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:08,880
lives in here and when the soul lives in

215
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:11,279
here you have that so you have the soul

216
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,880
and then you have the physical brain but

217
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:16,279
when metals get involved and they're all

218
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:17,839
jammed up in that midline Canal

219
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:20,560
communication between the right

220
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:24,320
Hemisphere and the left hemisphere can

221
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:26,720
go backwards in so many ways all

222
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:29,519
right Communications within the brain as

223
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:32,360
a result the brain must adapt so our

224
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:35,320
brains do adapt and you see it with

225
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:37,399
people if you've paid attention enough

226
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:39,279
to other people and what they're going

227
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:41,720
through and what they're suffering with

228
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:43,600
you can see how they adapt throughout

229
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:45,240
the years if you know somebody long

230
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,440
enough or maybe it's a family member and

231
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:50,440
you know them for the rest of your life

232
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:53,560
right okay the brain must adapt and

233
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:56,160
electrical impulses find new avenues so

234
00:09:53,560 --> 00:10:00,200
let's talk about that for a second

235
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:03,320
electrical impulses find new avenues

236
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:05,800
important to know all

237
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:10,120
right okay let's hit

238
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:14,320
it all right an electrical impulse let's

239
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:18,600
do a little electrical grid here all

240
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,600
right do a little bit of electrical

241
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:24,560
grid there we

242
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:26,200
go okay electrical grid inside your

243
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:31,040
brain right

244
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:31,040
there when you get metal which is all

245
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,200
in the midline

246
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:42,120
canal and you get it sprinkled about in

247
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:44,279
different places Mercury

248
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:47,800
aluminum

249
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:49,360
okay what happens is electrical

250
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:51,680
impulses

251
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,920
electricity hits the metal and when it

252
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:56,240
hits the metal it has to derail and go

253
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:58,079
somewhere else and when it goes

254
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,200
somewhere else it ends up hitting

255
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:02,399
neurons that wasn't supposed to travel

256
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:04,160
through different Avenues it wasn't

257
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,639
supposed to travel to so as these

258
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:09,440
electrical impulses this electricity

259
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:12,320
this electrical grid is moving it's

260
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:16,120
hitting into metal right there when it

261
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:18,040
hits into metal it then moves away from

262
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:20,440
the metal it travels a different

263
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:22,560
direction so every time an electrical

264
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:25,000
impulse is cruising here it goes right

265
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:28,120
into the metal grid right there boom

266
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,279
into the metal grid ricochets sometimes

267
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:32,920
it goes off to a different avenue it has

268
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:36,000
to find different places to go and

269
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:40,440
that's the adapting people do children

270
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,360
do right adults do they adapt some of

271
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:44,519
them have to fight their way through it

272
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:47,399
but they adapt but the electrical

273
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:49,279
impulses end up hitting metal which is

274
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:51,800
the red mark right there and then

275
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:53,880
travels into a different area you see

276
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:55,600
and that's this whole thing where it's

277
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:57,240
it's like that basically when we're

278
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,920
suffering with any kind of condition or

279
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:03,480
symptoms whether it's brain f focus and

280
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:04,920
concentration issues however it is it's

281
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:07,560
it's we have to fight through it our

282
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:09,279
brain is fighting through it for us

283
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:11,639
those electrical impulses are going in

284
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:13,920
different places you know so we can

285
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:18,240
actually adapt and somehow survive it

286
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,240
and we do we do adapt and we do survive

287
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:24,480
it Aon over there on YouTube I'm doing

288
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:26,839
the obsessive thoughts brain shot as you

289
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,519
speak it's so helpful and I am really

290
00:12:26,839 --> 00:12:31,839
grateful oh that's incredible brain

291
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,600
shots right there oh in the book right

292
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:34,680
here

293
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,880
too

294
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,880
woohoo okay let's go into this a little

295
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,639
bit

296
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:43,000
more all

297
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:45,079
right um and here's the thing what

298
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,040
people don't realize when we're dealing

299
00:12:45,079 --> 00:12:49,440
with these symptoms and conditions is

300
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:51,800
that there are real reasons why we're

301
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,120
dealing with it and we tend to start

302
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,880
beating ourselves up so I've seen people

303
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:58,079
with

304
00:12:54,880 --> 00:13:00,639
ADHD just beat the crap out of

305
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:02,560
themselves because they're not

306
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:05,079
performing they feel like they're not

307
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:07,440
performing the way they need to they

308
00:13:05,079 --> 00:13:09,240
feel they're not they're not doing what

309
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,440
they need to do they're judging

310
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:13,480
themselves people are judging them that

311
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,959
live with them or that know them and it

312
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:18,240
gets really hard and we get so

313
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:19,920
disconnected to realizing there's

314
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,600
actually a real problem and it's not my

315
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:25,040
fault that we end up just beating the

316
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:27,000
crap out of ourselves I've seen that

317
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:29,519
happen for so many people for so many

318
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,519
years so you know and if the medication

319
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:33,760
they're taking the amphetamines aren't

320
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:36,360
doing good enough for them then they're

321
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:38,760
really hard on themselves and they just

322
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:41,800
walk around like my ADHD is really

323
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:43,560
acting up my ADHD is really I got ADHD

324
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:45,680
and that's they tell themselves over and

325
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:48,240
over again but really what they have is

326
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:50,399
I got a metal deposit I got Metals in

327
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,800
the mid midline canals what they should

328
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:55,120
be knowing I got metal sprinkled about

329
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,920
in my brain and I got to get these

330
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,880
Metals out because these metals are

331
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:01,880
causing this but people take it on like

332
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:03,920
themselves where they don't know it's

333
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:06,519
the metals they don't know it's

334
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:09,480
something else so then it's them it's

335
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:11,600
them they're the ones so a lot of people

336
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:13,800
are hard on themselves because they're

337
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:18,160
the problem that's what they believe I

338
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:20,560
got ADHD I'm struggling I suck I totally

339
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:23,079
suck and that's what people believe they

340
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,360
feel that way they they they push

341
00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:25,839
through they push through they take

342
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,880
their amphetamines they prescribed

343
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:29,759
amphetamines and they push through and

344
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:31,199
they try to function they try to live

345
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:33,199
their life but they always have this

346
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:35,920
thing kind of hanging over them like I'm

347
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:39,079
just I I'm hard to talk to I get it I

348
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:42,160
got ADHD or I'm having a moment with the

349
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:45,040
ADHD and then they're hard on themselves

350
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:47,079
because they're not focused on what a

351
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:49,320
with the real problem is they weren't

352
00:14:47,079 --> 00:14:51,560
enlightened into the real problem they

353
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:53,560
weren't educated on the real problem

354
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:57,240
instead they're educated with you got

355
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:59,880
ADHD that's your problem boy that's your

356
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:01,480
problem and you got to live with it you

357
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,920
can try to take some medication if you

358
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,360
can you can try to get rid of processed

359
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:06,759
food and try to eat better and maybe

360
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:09,040
it'll improve a little but either way

361
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:11,240
you end up thinking that you're just you

362
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:14,000
got this problem and people when you

363
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:15,759
move that over to like the real problem

364
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,440
that's when life changes instantly

365
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:22,720
already it's like wait a minute this

366
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:26,800
isn't me I'm not the ADHD

367
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:29,319
person this isn't me um that's not my

368
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:31,720
identity I'm struggling with toxic heavy

369
00:15:29,319 --> 00:15:33,199
metals I need to get that out so then

370
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:36,519
when you're doing the medical medium

371
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:39,720
heavy metal detox and your ADHD is is

372
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:43,279
leaving it's like a rebirth it's like

373
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:45,600
what the heck is going on so many people

374
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:48,120
then they're like reborn it's a

375
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:50,959
religious experience when you can get

376
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:53,759
rid of something like your ADHD and you

377
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:56,319
can get rid of it and it's just

378
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:57,920
religious experience it's like what

379
00:15:56,319 --> 00:16:00,000
because you're actually like you're

380
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:02,399
actually hunkering down you're getting

381
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,880
disciplined you're doing the heavy metal

382
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,680
detox and you're getting better and

383
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,800
you're putting it behind you so many

384
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:10,639
people got rid of their ADHD it's not

385
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,399
even in their vocabulary anymore they

386
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,920
don't even talk about it they moved on

387
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:17,920
with their life there it was way put in

388
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:19,680
the past that's the medical medium

389
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:23,040
information it's just it's just

390
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:25,160
incredible Trish HR says on Facebook so

391
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:27,839
you disagree what science says about it

392
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:29,199
relating to a dopamine deficiency

393
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,440
correct

394
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:34,519
I do because the dopamine dopamine

395
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:37,319
deficiency was um was a theory they

396
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:39,839
don't have any way to prove it I mean

397
00:16:37,319 --> 00:16:43,560
look if science can prove it if they can

398
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:45,600
show you all that a dopamine deficiency

399
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:47,480
is really happening in somebody's brain

400
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,120
like could if they could really show you

401
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:53,440
and then somehow show you that that

402
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:55,120
dopamine deficiency is causing the ADHD

403
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,800
but they can't right they can't do any

404
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,720
of that they can't do anything they can

405
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:02,839
just write a paper and that's what they

406
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:05,000
do so Trish they just write a paper and

407
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:06,679
a paper with a theory on it saying you

408
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,319
know dopamine deficiency they don't have

409
00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:09,640
a way to test they don't have a way to

410
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:13,039
test that that's the

411
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:15,199
ADHD and then that's it there's nothing

412
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:16,640
there it's like sand through your hands

413
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:19,160
right but if they had a way to actually

414
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:22,120
show that or prove it or be able to show

415
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:25,079
someone somehow that that was it and

416
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:26,439
they can present that then yeah I'd be

417
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:27,760
open to it I'd be like all right but

418
00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:29,520
they've never done that doesn't it

419
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,440
because just like all you know know what

420
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,520
science is doing for Alzheimer's now

421
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,919
they're taking medical medium info about

422
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:38,760
um Mercury toxic heavy metals being

423
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:41,240
responsible for Alzheimer's so now

424
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:43,440
they're talking about that now um a

425
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:46,120
decade or more later after I've already

426
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:49,039
been talking about it teaching about it

427
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:51,799
and Publishing information about it so

428
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:54,559
now science is like oh we think it could

429
00:17:51,799 --> 00:17:56,760
be Metals really and they still haven't

430
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:59,760
found the metals in the person's brain

431
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:01,679
to line it up to actually be Alzheimer's

432
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,799
keep that in mind it's not like they cut

433
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:06,640
somebody's brain open and they found a

434
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:09,000
metal deposit and they said hey that's

435
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,640
the Alzheimer's we have a metal deposit

436
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,600
in somebody's brain they they're not

437
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:15,440
doing that they're just like hearing

438
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:17,520
about it because of the books you know

439
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,760
millions of copies around the world and

440
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:22,000
and talking about you know like metals

441
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,880
and metals and causing Alzheimer's and

442
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,440
Dementia and then they're hearing about

443
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:27,679
it and then they're writing papers

444
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,000
saying you know we think there might be

445
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:32,960
Metals in evolved but they haven't cut

446
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,840
open somebody's brain they haven't

447
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:38,000
discovered a deposit of metal and then

448
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:40,280
they haven't lined it up to alzheimer's

449
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:44,159
see so yeah that's pretty much where

450
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:46,799
we're at so the evolving domestic

451
00:18:44,159 --> 00:18:49,640
chemical situation you guys that people

452
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:52,559
are breathing in every single day from

453
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:55,240
treatments on their lawns to fabric

454
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:56,960
softeners to detergents to fragrances to

455
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:58,159
the scented candles right now you hear

456
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,320
it all the time right scented candles

457
00:18:58,159 --> 00:19:03,480
say it's like yep sended candles to all

458
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:08,120
the different fragrances perfumes and

459
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:11,039
colog those do domestic Invaders Harbor

460
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:13,360
more metals they also lower the immune

461
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:15,640
system they also have their own toxic

462
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:18,360
agents inside of them but what happens

463
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:21,240
is those contribute to more Metals

464
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:25,520
they're vaporized Metals so fragrances

465
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:28,880
are vaporized Metals toxic conventional

466
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:30,919
fragrances I'm not talking about like a

467
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:35,080
really pure lemon

468
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:37,200
oil okay from the Rind of the lemon and

469
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:38,840
that's what you're smelling that has

470
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,039
heavy metals in there I'm not going

471
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:43,039
there I'm talking about like the

472
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:45,600
fragrances that are just in everyday's

473
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:48,919
everyday people's lives the air

474
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,919
fresheners to the car air fresheners the

475
00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:53,240
fabric softeners perfumes cologn the

476
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:54,679
scented candles to the fungicides

477
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:58,360
everything that's thrown on People's

478
00:19:54,679 --> 00:20:00,440
Clothing all of it combined is filled

479
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:02,520
with vaporized metal and so you're

480
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:04,840
breathing it in and what happens is with

481
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:06,440
children when they have ADHD they

482
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:08,679
already have the metals in the midline

483
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:10,919
canal they're already struggling they're

484
00:20:08,679 --> 00:20:13,080
already dealing with Metals right the

485
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:15,240
aluminum the Mercury and other metals

486
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:18,520
and then on top of that you get all the

487
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:20,720
domestic Invaders those exposures and

488
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:23,679
breathing in all of those exposures and

489
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:26,640
all that metal and then yeah it just

490
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:29,679
compiles and worsens and worsens worsens

491
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:31,520
things but if somebody wants an answer

492
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:34,880
how do I get rid of my ADHD got to get

493
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:37,600
the medals out have to it's critical got

494
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:42,080
to get them out heavy metal

495
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:45,760
detox very important heavy metal detox

496
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:49,120
if you want the metals out it's that

497
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:51,440
critical and one that is that has a

498
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:53,440
track record that has worked for so many

499
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,200
people that's what matters not new ones

500
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,480
people put together because they want to

501
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,720
hop on the bandwagon the train they want

502
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:02,320
to make money sell products that's all

503
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:04,600
great and all but use a heavy metal

504
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:07,080
detox that is known to work for years

505
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:08,480
and years and years Dr fwn also don't

neurodiversity um

508
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:15,159
celebration it's meant to normalize the

509
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:18,320
fact that everyone is having

510
00:21:15,159 --> 00:21:23,080
neurological problems and Dr Fawn by the

in ADHD expert in so many different

513
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:31,120
neuro and brain condition

514
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:33,360
so Dr F thank you for being here amazing

another little spot here where are we

517
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:41,520
brain fog

518
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:44,679
yep brain fog is always worth talking

519
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:47,360
about because so many people suffer from

520
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:50,120
it to a degree that they feel like

Alzheimer's Alzheimer's early dementia

524
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:03,360
they're getting diagnosis of early

525
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:07,679
diseases and anybody who's asking about

526
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:10,279

brain fog is is that it's not like it

536

was years ago I used to see like severe

537
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:39,279
brain fog cases years ago I used to see

538
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:41,720
there's there was a decent amount of

539
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:44,480
people with it but for the majority of

540
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:49,000
people with brain fog years ago it was

541
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:53,799
more mild conditions not as many serious

542
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:55,600
now we're in an epic state of emergency

543
00:22:53,799 --> 00:22:58,360
when it comes down to brain fog there

544
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:00,559
are so many people coming down with it

545
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:03,799
every single day they get the worst

546
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:06,480
brain fog conditions after right see

547
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:08,919
after the flu after some kind of you

548
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:12,200
know condition like some kind of like

00:23:08,919 --> 00:23:14,279
bug that's going around or stomach flu

550
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:16,600
or you neuro virus or something and then

551
00:23:14,279 --> 00:23:18,279
they have the worst brain fog afterwards

552
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:22,080
there's a lot of people triggered into

553
00:23:18,279 --> 00:23:23,799
it but there's a lot of people that just

554
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,600
it just happens they wake up in the

555
00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:28,520
morning and one morning and it's not

556
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:30,919
working something is not right

557
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:34,080
something's not kind of clicking in and

558
00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:36,799
then it goes away by 10: in the morning

559
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:39,240
or it comes in at 10: in the morning and

560
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:41,799
then it goes away at around 1 and then

561
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:43,799
it comes in bad at 3: and then they're

562
00:23:41,799 --> 00:23:45,840
like intermittent brain fog and they're

563
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:49,760
in this this state of intermittent brain

564
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:52,840
fog and then it's all day every day all

565
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:55,240
day every day sometimes really bad

566
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:58,320
sometimes not so bad scale one to 10

567
00:23:55,240 --> 00:24:01,279
well my brain fog is out of three today

568
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:03,960
next day my brain fog is out of seven

569
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:07,200
the next day my brain fog is out of five

570
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:09,840
next day my brain fog is out 11 where I

571
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:12,039
can't even focus I can't think I can't

572
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:15,559
work I can't do anything so many people

573
00:24:12,039 --> 00:24:18,159
really suffer from brain fog and they

574
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:19,919
really do all right so let's go into a

575
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:21,120
little bit severe cases of brain fog can

576
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:23,880
be

577
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:26,039
devastating indeed

578
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:29,399
devastating making people feel like

579
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:31,360
they've lost their Minds I'm in brains

580
00:24:29,399 --> 00:24:33,720
saver guys just reading right out of

581
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:36,080
brains saver I'm on page 329 I saw

582
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:38,960
somebody asked what page

583

[Music]

587
00:24:46,279 --> 00:24:50,840
books very interesting all right let's

588
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:52,840
keep on going even mild brain fog is

589
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:55,960
very challenging on the person's mental

590
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:58,159
and emotional state I find brain fog

591
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:01,039
being one of the most challenging for a

592
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:03,760
lot of people and

593
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:05,200
um you know it's really really difficult

594
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:07,360
for a lot of people can I put this right

595
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,799
here you guys there we go kind of in in

596
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:13,960
every every place

597
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:17,799
there heavy metal

598
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:21,200
detox can't say it enough get

599
00:25:17,799 --> 00:25:26,240
better work on it

600
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:30,559
heal move past it there is life after

601
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:34,360
chronic illness there is okay there is

602
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:39,200
life after chronic illness keep that in

603
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:42,480
mind never forget that there truly

604
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:44,240
is okay even mild brain fog is very

605
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:47,200
challenging on the person's mental and

606
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:49,880
emotional state one major factor behind

607
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:52,039
brain fog is a liver that's saturated

608
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:53,880
with a lot of toxic

609
00:25:52,039 --> 00:25:56,679
metals and

610
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:59,520
garbage so there we go got the liver

611
00:25:56,679 --> 00:26:02,480
again don't lose that

612
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:04,240
liver okay livers that get filled up

613
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,880
with all kinds of junk all kinds of

614
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:09,760
different stuff toxic heavy metals are a

615
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:11,600
big one right there yep scented candles

616
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:15,559
air fresheners fragrances pesticides

617
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:18,279
herbicides other toxins providing fuel

618
00:26:15,559 --> 00:26:22,799
now here's the thing with brain fog

619
00:26:18,279 --> 00:26:26,600
okay brain fog is a little different

620
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:30,679
sometimes where someone is viral and

621
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:34,960
toxic viruses in the liver that's the

622
00:26:30,679 --> 00:26:38,960
liver virus in the liver yes the liver

623
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:46,840
Harbors so many viruses Epstein bar cyto

624
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:49,799
virus hhv6 hhv7 herpes simplex one HSV 2

625
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:52,919
okay undiscovered herpes viruses

626
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:55,919
shingles sit inside our liver that's

627
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:59,000
where they sit and what they do is they

628
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:00,880
eat and feed on the the metals so they

629
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:04,200
eat and feed on the metals inside the

630
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:06,760
liver and then they release a neurotoxin

631
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:09,320
and that neurotoxin goes into the

632
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:12,720
bloodstream and floats

633
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:16,000
around and gets all through the body and

634
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:19,159
then it hits the brain and then we short

635
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:23,200
circuit and then we got brain

636
00:27:19,159 --> 00:27:25,279
fog all right the epin bar virus feeds

637
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:27,840
on these poisons the neurotoxins it

638
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:32,320
releases explode through the bloodstream

639
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:36,520
and spinal fluid and from there they can

640
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:40,919
cross get ready the blood brain

641
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:45,000
barrier due to their unique infiltration

642
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:48,360
quality they can trojen horse it into

643
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:51,159
your brain they can cross the blood

644
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:54,159
brain barrier they can trojen horse it

645
00:27:51,159 --> 00:27:56,440
in there that's what they do okay they

646
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:58,840
enter into the brain they shortcircuit

647
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:02,399
neurons when once again we're in that

648
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:05,080
place where the neurons are all short

649
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:06,840
circuiting Rooney Lee says I'm noticing

650
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:10,279
more of my friends getting brain fog

651
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:12,720
after a sickness yes it lasts for them

652
00:28:10,279 --> 00:28:16,039
it lasts for them long after they're

653
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:19,039
sick yes Rooney totally and and I see

654
00:28:16,039 --> 00:28:23,880
that all the time let me explain why

655
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:28,760
okay so all right you catch the

656
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:31,240
flu you get it you're sick with a fever

657
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:35,200
you're dealing with the flu you got

658
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:38,360
congestion your body is overrun by flu

659
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:41,240
viruses they are proliferating and

660
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:45,240
exploding your immune system has to

661
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:47,880
battle those flu viruses that's your

662
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:50,240
immune cells right there's the flu

663
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:53,760
viruses a war

664
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:57,519
ensues okay many of your white blood

665
00:28:53,760 --> 00:29:00,600
cells your immune cells and killer cells

666
00:28:57,519 --> 00:29:02,919
get destroyed in the process many of

667
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:05,200
them are lost in the battle and as

668
00:29:02,919 --> 00:29:07,399
they're battling the flu virus it's

669
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:10,919
that's happening right there the immune

670
00:29:07,399 --> 00:29:14,120
cell dies and you lost another immune

671
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:17,159
cell and then many of the immune cells

672
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:19,880
are actually killing the flu virus see

673
00:29:17,159 --> 00:29:22,519
and eating the flu virus until it's gone

674
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:24,159
and then die themselves your immune

675
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:27,480
cells die

676
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:29,640
themselves because the flu made you lose

677
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:34,679
half your immune system or

678
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:37,840
more something decided to rise

679
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:42,360
up something rose

680
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:43,840
up it was another virus that was sitting

681
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:47,320
inside the

682
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:50,120
liver percolating and living in there

683
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:52,559
having a good time whether it was

684
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:55,000
dormant or just a little bit post

685
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:57,559
dorment and then after the flu when you

686
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,840
losing your half of your immune system

687
00:29:57,559 --> 00:30:01,519
battling the flu viruses and your immune

688
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:06,200
cells

689
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:07,360
died the virus rose up and that virus

690
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:10,559
Epstein

691
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:14,120
bar most of the time Epstein

692
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:16,559
bar is having its day and then it's

693
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:20,000
feeding on things it likes to feed on

694
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:20,960
poisons toxins toxic heavy metals eggs

695
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,039
as

696
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:25,559
well

697
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:28,039
eggs and when it feeds on those eggs

698
00:30:25,559 --> 00:30:29,919
because you're having eggs I don't want

699
00:30:28,039 --> 00:30:32,720
to drop that

700
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:35,640
egg what happens is that it's releasing

701
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:38,799
more poisons and toxins those toxins and

702
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:38,799
poisons go to the

703
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:43,960
brain and we end up short

704
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:46,279
circuiting and where we end up sicker

705
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:48,000
than we were before I was talking about

706
00:30:46,279 --> 00:30:52,519
this long before the

707
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:54,600
2019 20 long before the 2020

708
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:58,559
pandemic I've been talking about this

709
00:30:54,600 --> 00:31:01,399
long before that so it's long flu and

710
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:04,320
that's what it is you get the flu or you

711
00:31:01,399 --> 00:31:07,639
get the neuro

712
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:10,559
virus you get some kind of bug it knocks

713
00:31:07,639 --> 00:31:13,360
your immune system down a war ensues

714
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:14,880
your immune cells die and when they die

715
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:18,080
because they're trying to save your life

716
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:19,679
and they're beating down viruses then a

717
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:22,960
different virus that's been hidden in

718
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:26,519
you set aega virus Epstein bar hhv6

719
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:28,519
hhv7 shingles Rises up most of the time

720
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:31,159
Epstein bar virus that's the one that's

721
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:33,159
the opportunist in the situation Rises

722
00:31:31,159 --> 00:31:37,159
up and now you're sicker with other

723
00:31:33,159 --> 00:31:40,039
problems long after your flu long after

724
00:31:37,159 --> 00:31:41,960
all that so yeah very

725
00:31:40,039 --> 00:31:46,480
interesting

726
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:49,240
okay over there on YouTube I own a Gaba

727
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:51,799
and celery Force help my brain fog so

728
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:57,840
much they do I recommend it to friends

729
00:31:51,799 --> 00:32:01,679
all the time I do I do I do okay

730
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:04,120
okay MTO cery Force for brain

731
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:06,639
fog

732
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:09,080
yep I agree all right let's get into

733
00:32:06,639 --> 00:32:11,320
this because we got some stuff to cover

734
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:13,960
okay when upar feeds on these poisons

735
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:16,519
the neurotoxins it releases explode

736
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:18,880
through the bloodstream spinal fluid

737
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:21,200
cross the bloodb brain barrier you have

738
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:23,760
now brain

739
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:26,159
fog and then short circuiting of the

740
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:29,200
neurons happens and then damaged

741
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:30,279
neurotransmitter occur these neurotoxins

742
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,639
have the ability to diminish

743
00:32:30,279 --> 00:32:33,880
neurotransmitter activity and

744
00:32:31,639 --> 00:32:35,440
neurotransmitter chemicals themselves

745
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:37,000
basically your neur neurotransmitter

746
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:39,600
chemicals start to diminish and then

747
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:42,880
you're in worse

748
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:45,559
shape Kate Courtney says I got brain fog

749
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:49,600
and you were the only one who saved me a

750
00:32:45,559 --> 00:32:53,880
blessing led me to your first book right

751
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:56,760
as it was released and I knew I found

752
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:58,000
the truth thank you he here's my first

753
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:00,760
book

754
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:03,600
it's a new edition that's

755
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:05,760
it all

756
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:07,279
right the electrical impulse was

757
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,919
carrying messages and thoughts and

758
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:12,679
information so let's cover that really

759
00:33:08,919 --> 00:33:12,679
quick all right

760
00:33:24,519 --> 00:33:28,960
so yep

761
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:39,720
all

762
00:33:36,919 --> 00:33:42,880
right so your brain right

763
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:44,519
here okay electrical impulses are

764
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:47,600
carrying information so all that

765
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:50,320
electricity going through your

766
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:51,840
brain all that electricity going through

767
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:55,240
your

768
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:59,760
brain is carrying

769
00:33:55,240 --> 00:34:02,159
information I was just thinking you know

770
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:06,039
right when it snows

771
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:08,720
outside how pretty it is the snowflakes

772
00:34:06,039 --> 00:34:11,919
are coming down do you ever see like the

773
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:15,159
big snowflakes they're coming down and

774
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:18,280
the temperatur is somewhere around 32°

775
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:21,040
33° and the big snowflakes are just

776
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:22,240
floating down and they look like they're

777
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:26,240
about to

778
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:27,399
melt and when they land on your hand

779
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:30,839
they're half

780
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:33,119
melted and it feels cold but yet it's

781
00:34:30,839 --> 00:34:37,839
not that cold

782
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:42,639
outside and the air smells so fresh and

783
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:42,639
clean right okay all

784
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:48,720
right electricity is carrying

785
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:50,599
information throughout your brain

786
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:51,599
electricity is carrying information

787
00:34:50,599 --> 00:34:54,079
throughout your

788
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:58,359
brain so

789
00:34:54,079 --> 00:35:03,280
I I love the winter

790
00:34:58,359 --> 00:35:07,200
and like I really like the snow

791
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:12,320
um you know like when when it's get gets

792
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:15,680
cold outside and the snowflakes when

793
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:17,119
they're they're bigger do you ever see

794
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:21,160
them like

795
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:23,599
melt like I talked to somebody recently

796
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:25,800
and that's what they said to me and I

797
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:28,760
knew they meant everything that I just

798
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:32,560
said and they couldn't get it out their

799
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:35,240
brain fog was so bad the electricity was

800
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:38,320
hitting metal and toxins everywhere they

801
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:39,960
had so many neurotoxins in their brain

802
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:42,000
and they were trying to tell

803
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:44,520
me

804
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,119
that what they really wanted to say

805
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:48,079
because I sat there and I talked to them

806
00:35:46,119 --> 00:35:50,160
and I talked to them for like 45 minutes

807
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:52,160
for like an hour and I talked all about

808
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:54,599
I said take your time tell me what you

809
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:59,200
mean tell me what you want to say and

810
00:35:54,599 --> 00:36:03,359
the person who used to talk perfectly

811
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:06,160
fine talked great articulate anything

812
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:07,520
actually really smart person a genius

813
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:10,359
could not

814
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:12,599
explain properly how they felt

815
00:36:10,359 --> 00:36:14,839
emotionally how they felt about the air

816
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:16,800
being so crisp and clean how they felt

817
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:19,119
about the snowflakes how they just start

818
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:21,079
to melt how the temperature was about 33

819
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:22,720
degrees really highly intelligent person

820
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:24,440
that wanted to talk about temperatures

821
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,880
fluctuations of temperatures and

822
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:27,359
different weather patterns and the

823
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:29,880
snowflakes into different sizes and

824
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:32,079
shapes right all that and they couldn't

825
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:34,920
even get it out and they literally were

826
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:38,160
in tears and said aw that's why I need

827
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:39,920
to know like I there somebody I haven't

828
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:42,119
talked to in years that I knew 20 years

829
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:44,280
ago and they reached out to me and

830
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:46,079
they're like I can't even tell you what

831
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:47,760
I'm going through right now and I'm like

832
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:49,720
I know what you're going through I I

833
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:52,200
know I understand yes I'm not in your

834
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:54,960
shoes and I'm not living with that but

835
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:58,359
but I know I do know the spirit of

836
00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:01,800
compassion just allows me to know I I I

837
00:36:58,359 --> 00:37:03,319
since I was a child so and this person

838
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:05,160
this person couldn't even get that out

839
00:37:03,319 --> 00:37:07,760
and the brain fog was taking over and

840
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:09,960
taking over they had a rest that's it

841
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:12,400
after that 45 minutes of talking they

842
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:15,880
were in bed and they were done for the

843
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:18,560
day that was it the brain fog was so bad

844
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:21,000
and this was post having a really bad

845
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:24,079
flu like a month ago six weeks ago

846
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:26,800
whatever it was terrible terrible so

847
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:28,240
electrical impulses electricity is going

848
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,800
through the brain carrying information

849
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:31,720
so it's carrying that snowflake

850
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:33,599
information or what do you want to talk

851
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:35,240
about do you want to talk about

852
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:37,079
something that you saw you want to talk

853
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:38,480
about some birds you identified and you

854
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:40,000
want to you want to tell somebody about

855
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:42,960
which birds you like are your favorite

856
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:47,200
birds and you want to talk about that so

857
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:49,160
you have Birds right you have birds in

858
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,720
that information what else do you want

859
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:52,480
to talk about grocery shopping you were

860
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:54,599
at the store you saw some really

861
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:56,240
incredible apples right so you're

862
00:37:54,599 --> 00:38:00,400
looking at these amazing apples so you

863
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:02,200
got apples on in your mind right on that

864
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:04,520
electrical impulse in that electrical

865
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:07,160
impulse going through the neuron you got

866
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:08,960
apples information about that the ones

867
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:10,480
that you like you like the red apples

868
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:13,800
you like whatever Apple that you like

869
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:15,599
the Fuji apples the bray burs the Gallas

870
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:17,800
all that and what happens is when your

871
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:19,880
brain fog is really really bad you won't

872
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:21,880
be able to really kind of come across to

873
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:24,480
somebody about the gala versus the bray

874
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:28,040
bur versus the Fuji versus the honey

875
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:30,200
crisp right versus the the Macintosh

876
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:34,359
versus the red delicious versus the you

877
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:37,079
know the the all the different ones and

878
00:38:34,359 --> 00:38:39,240
the Granny Smith the green apple and you

879
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:40,800
won't even be able to kind of like work

880
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:42,560
with that with somebody else like talk

881
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:45,000
like you want to talk and that's it

882
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:47,480
people go through they suffer with

883
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,880
severe brain fog where they have to kind

884
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:50,839
of shut it down and shut it off where

885
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:52,119
they're not going to be able to talk

886
00:38:50,839 --> 00:38:53,960
about apples they're not going to be

887
00:38:52,119 --> 00:38:55,920
able to talk about their store trip so

888
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:57,560
much what they see or what they saw at

889
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:59,480
the Farmers Market Market or how the

890
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:01,760
weather is and what they whatever what

891
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:05,240
the trip they took they can't go into

892
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:07,560
detail and on that electrical you know

893
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:10,000
grid right here is all that information

894
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:11,800
trapped on it about the birds they saw

895
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,640
all the information about the food they

896
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:16,640
were eating or the food they like and

897
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:18,680
they whatever and it's on that grid and

898
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:20,280
then that grid short circuits right

899
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:22,640
there from neurotoxins it's short

900
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:24,599
circuits from all the Epstein bar

901
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:26,960
neurotoxins from other metals in the

902
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:30,040
brain and as it short circuiting

903
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:32,160
they're starting to run their adrenals

904
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:35,240
it's not their fault but their adrenals

905
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:37,359
start to crank up okay here they here

906
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:41,079
they are lost

907
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:43,720
them and they start to sweat people with

908
00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:46,839
a lot of brain fog

909
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:50,000
sweat when they're talking to someone or

910
00:39:46,839 --> 00:39:52,599
trying to convey something or articulate

911
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,640
something or get something across

912
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:57,079
especially if it's emotional if it's

913
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:59,119
emotional they start to get wrenched

914
00:39:57,079 --> 00:40:00,839
their armpits get

915
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:03,440
filled

916
00:40:00,839 --> 00:40:05,480
because adrenaline is actually kicking

917
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:07,079
in adrenaline's kicking in because

918
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:08,880
there's a problem in the brain there's

919
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:12,000
something wrong in the brain there's a

920
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:14,000
short circuit so really bad brain fog a

921
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,040
short circuit

922
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,760
happens and when that short circuit

923
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:20,960
happens because metals and neurotoxins

924
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:22,760
are interfering with electrical impulses

925
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,839
electrical activity and when that's

926
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:27,119
happening they're short circuiting and

927
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:29,079
it's making them nervous

928
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:32,119
and they're struggling and then their

929
00:40:29,079 --> 00:40:34,079
adrenals start to release

930
00:40:32,119 --> 00:40:36,200
adrenaline and that adrenaline is

931
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:39,240
rushing through their body because they

932
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:41,079
have to convey a message and they're

933
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:45,280
upset and they're

934
00:40:41,079 --> 00:40:50,480
emotional and then they get wet their

935
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:50,480
armpits fill with water they start to

936
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:58,319
sweat happens all the

937
00:40:55,319 --> 00:40:58,319
time

938
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:03,640
Tekk says oh my God on YouTube oh my God

939
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:06,000
aw that's me when I try to communicate

940
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:08,680
with others it's difficult to get my

941
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:11,839
words out thank you for all you

942
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:11,839
do all

943
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:18,319
right I'm really sorry you go through

944
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:22,040
that by the way I really am sorry all

945
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:24,560
right over there you're speaking you're

946
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:26,839
speaking to me a w I would struggle to

947
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:28,680
find words to speak

948
00:41:26,839 --> 00:41:33,040
wasn't even able to find things in my

949
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:37,400
own house it was that bad only and only

950
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:41,599
medical medium info helps me when I

951
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:41,599
suffered to death it's

952
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:48,160
awful I'm so glad that the information

953
00:41:44,839 --> 00:41:51,119
is helping it's moving you forward thank

954
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:54,640
God anelia says this is me I can't

955
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:56,599
recount anything I don't sweat but it's

956
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:58,880
so hard and I feel frustrated ated

957
00:41:56,599 --> 00:42:01,839
because I remember the feeling of what

958
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:06,560
happened but not

959
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:09,720
details I understand I

960
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:12,760
do yeah we're in brain fog a little bit

961
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:12,760
more and then we're going to move

962
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:17,920
on all right these neurotoxins have the

963
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:19,480
ability to diminish neuro

964
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:21,319
neurotransmitter activity and

965
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:24,520
neurotransmitter chemicals themselves

966
00:42:21,319 --> 00:42:26,599
meaning that when an electrical impulse

967
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:28,200
electrical impulse tries to run down a

968
00:42:26,599 --> 00:42:30,160
neuron the electrical impulse can

969
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:32,200
misfire and it's approaching any kind of

970
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:34,079
contamination so it misfires in short

971
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:37,240
circuits that's what

972
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:39,480
happens another factor in brain fog is a

973
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:43,880
high toxic heavy metal

974
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:47,119
load yes within the brain itself that's

975
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:49,920
a brain loaded with Metals that's

976
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:52,160
another form of brain fog you can have

977
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:55,119
both you can have

978
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:58,760
both keep that in mind you better

979
00:42:55,119 --> 00:43:01,240
believe it okay here's a metal deposit

980
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:05,839
right there here's a metal deposit right

981
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:08,920
there aluminum Mercury lead cadmium

982
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:11,440
arsenic right metal

983
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:13,800
deposits you can have a bad case of

984
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:17,280
brain fog or you can have metal

985
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:19,920
sprinkled about like this Christmas tree

986
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:23,400
types of of metal sprinkled

987
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:26,640
about you can have different Metals all

988
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:29,359
sprinkled about in the brain there you

989
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:33,200
go

990
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:35,280
okay toxic heavy

991
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:38,839
metals

992
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:41,520
metals that can get us in trouble big

993
00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:41,520
time let's move

994
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:45,440
on

995
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:49,800
okay celery

996
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:54,720
juice I got some celery

997
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:57,640
juice by the way a little grapefruit

998
00:43:54,720 --> 00:44:00,319
juice today

999
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:02,359
needed a little glucose right

1000
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:07,280
there to

1001
00:44:02,359 --> 00:44:10,240
um get me pumped up all right let's

1002
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:13,040
go focus and concentration

1003
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:16,200
issues let's hit that a little bit one

1004
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:18,119
source of focus and concentration issues

1005
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:21,319
is along the lines of what you read

1006
00:44:18,119 --> 00:44:23,400
about in the ADHD section heavy metals

1007
00:44:21,319 --> 00:44:26,200
such as mercury and aluminum in the

1008
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:27,760
cerebral midline Canal sprinkle

1009
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:29,480
throughout the brain as well or both

1010
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:34,520
when metals reside in the brain they

1011
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:36,240
often dampen dampen electrical activity

1012
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:38,319
causing the brain to try to adapt by

1013
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:41,079
increasing electrical output which

1014
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:43,839
brings on temporary bouts of

1015
00:44:41,079 --> 00:44:45,480
clarity that results in overheating so

1016
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:46,599
then the brain must go into extreme

1017
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:48,160
cooling so we're going to talk about

1018
00:44:46,599 --> 00:44:50,640
overheating cooling the whole bit so I'm

1019
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:54,319
in this book right here brain

1020
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:54,319
saver brain

1021
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:58,760
saver

1022
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:00,800
okay which ends up reducing electricity

1023
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:02,640
act activity leading someone to

1024
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:06,680
flip-flop back to moments of poor

1025
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:08,880
concentration so cooling heating cooling

1026
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:11,240
heating cooling

1027
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:13,800
heating this is interesting right here

1028
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:17,079
about focusing concentration okay our

1029
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:20,000
brains get hot and then they quickly

1030
00:45:17,079 --> 00:45:23,800
cool then they get hot again then they

1031
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,800
quickly cool that's what they

1032
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:30,119
do

1033
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:30,119
our brain gets

1034
00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:41,920
hot

1035
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:43,800
right okay that's what happens and

1036
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:47,000
sometimes our brain gets hot certain

1037
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:48,520
area just here our brain gets hot in

1038
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:51,000
this area right

1039
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:54,880
here heats up heats

1040
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:56,400
up then starts to cool

1041
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:59,920
down

1042
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:01,800
see this

1043
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:05,119
fluctuating you're

1044
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:07,680
focused you're focused you're getting

1045
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:07,680
focused

1046
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:14,599
again heats up heats up heats

1047
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:17,280
up you're losing concentration you can't

1048
00:46:14,599 --> 00:46:20,280
focus anymore cooling down cooling down

1049
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:20,280
cooling down cooling

1050
00:46:20,359 --> 00:46:26,000
down okay

1051
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:29,200
right you're getting focused you're

1052
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:32,319
getting focused it's coming into Clarity

1053
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:35,760
you can think you can actually talk

1054
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:38,160
think you're hanging in there heating up

1055
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:41,040
heating up heating up got a problem

1056
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:44,880
though got a problem cooling down

1057
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:47,119
cooling down cooling down can't focus

1058
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:49,599
losing concentration losing

1059
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:52,400
concentration okay trying to give an

1060
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:54,800
example of kind of how it

1061
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:56,559
works because having toxic heavy metals

1062
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:58,400
in the brain could could cause a lot of

1063
00:46:56,559 --> 00:47:01,760
different things to happen one is

1064
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:05,240
Extreme heating extreme cooling

1065
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:08,160
fluctuations of heating cooling heating

1066
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:11,960
cooling and then we're all over the map

1067
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:14,760
we are all over the map emotional we're

1068
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:17,160
like we're focused we're there and then

1069
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:19,160
we're we lost our focus our

1070
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:21,720
concentration we're somewhere else we're

1071
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:24,240
somewhere else now or we're now really

1072
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:27,040
emotional or we're less emotional we can

1073
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:29,559
be everywhere in any where Right Heating

1074
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:31,599
and Cooling happens inside the brain

1075
00:47:29,559 --> 00:47:34,319
because metals and the electrical Grid

1076
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:37,680
in some people this whole Supernatural

1077
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:39,559
thing happens physically and right not

1078
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:42,040
physically and it happens spiritually

1079
00:47:39,559 --> 00:47:45,960
and physically and it's a mesh a whole

1080
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:46,920
mesh of emotions of physical information

1081
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:49,760
in the

1082
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:52,440
neurons information that's in the

1083
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:54,359
soul there's a lot of heating there's a

1084
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:56,480
lot of emotional output and then there's

1085
00:47:54,359 --> 00:47:59,119
a lot of cooling and and it's up and

1086
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:00,800
down all of

1087
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:03,200
it

1088
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:05,200
okay when metals reside in the brain

1089
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:06,839
they often dampen Electric electrical

1090
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:08,839
activity causing the brain to try to

1091
00:48:06,839 --> 00:48:12,079
adapt by increasing electrical output

1092
00:48:08,839 --> 00:48:15,040
which brings in bouts of clarity Heating

1093
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:17,200
and then boom cooling which ends up

1094
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:19,720
reducing electrical activity leading

1095
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:21,960
someone to flip-flop back to moments of

1096
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:25,119
poor concentration where you're

1097
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:28,079
flip-flopping like I got Clarity I lost

1098
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:31,079
it I had Clarity an hour ago I lost it

1099
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:33,640
now now I'm struggling I had Clarity

1100
00:48:31,079 --> 00:48:37,160
this morning before my coffee I drank

1101
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:39,680
all my coffee had you know had Clarity

1102
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:41,040
boom and then after my coffee later on

1103
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:43,200
when everything just kind of like I

1104
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:47,040
don't know when my caffeine ran out no

1105
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:47,040
Clarity anymore no Focus no

1106
00:48:48,359 --> 00:48:54,559
concentration no focus and concentration

1107
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:56,160
issues can also come from a chronic

1108
00:48:54,559 --> 00:49:00,359
viral in

1109
00:48:56,160 --> 00:49:04,240
infection okay chronic viral

1110
00:49:00,359 --> 00:49:06,319
infection viruses love to eat they love

1111
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:09,280
to eat this delicious cheddar cheese I

1112
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:12,680
have right here they love cheddar

1113
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:15,240
cheese so when people eat cheddar cheese

1114
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:16,680
the viruses will love to feed on it

1115
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:19,880
sometimes it takes years and then

1116
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:21,359
finally boom it's just they fed on

1117
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:23,240
cheese every now and then when you're

1118
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:24,680
eating it and fed on more cheese every

1119
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:27,400
now and then when you eat it and then

1120
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:29,960
the virus is proliferated they

1121
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:31,839
multiplied they came out of dormy they

1122
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:34,720
got hungrier and

1123
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:36,720
hungrier and so cheese and dairy

1124
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:40,720
products will feed

1125
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:43,200
viruses they will they will over time

1126
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:44,839
butter will feed viruses over

1127
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:47,599
time

1128
00:49:44,839 --> 00:49:49,920
see Western says over there on YouTube I

1129
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:53,880
almost never have coffee but when I do

1130
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:57,839
my brain lights up and I can talk so

1131
00:49:53,880 --> 00:50:01,359
easily had my coffee Cofe but a day

1132
00:49:57,839 --> 00:50:04,200
later I'm depressed and tired oh man I'm

1133
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:08,880
depressed I'm

1134
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:11,720
tired yep I understand all right let's

1135
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:15,160
go let's move let's move move move let's

1136
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:17,400
keep it going

1137
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:19,559
um there a lot of a lot of good comments

1138
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:23,119
coming up okay why does that

1139
00:50:19,559 --> 00:50:26,720
happen you had your coffee and your

1140
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:31,400
adrenaline acted as an amphetamine

1141
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:34,160
guess what an amphetamine does okay CU

1142
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:36,640
your coffee is like a daily

1143
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:40,520
amphetamine every day people have their

1144
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:40,520
amphetamine through their caffeine

1145
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:45,160
right and then then there's people that

1146
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:49,280
are taking

1147
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:50,559
amphetamines okay I won't list them all

1148
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:53,480
but there's a bunch of them when they

1149
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:57,160
take their amphetamines guess what it

1150
00:50:53,480 --> 00:51:00,400
does it ignites

1151
00:50:57,160 --> 00:51:01,760
happiness out of your adrenals it

1152
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:05,240
ignites

1153
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:08,880
adrenaline so the reason why we take the

1154
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:11,799
amphetamine is so our adrenals can go

1155
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:13,760
boom and then we're focused we're

1156
00:51:11,799 --> 00:51:16,640
feeling better we're feeling like we can

1157
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:18,520
think we're rising out of our brain fog

1158
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:21,079
rising out of our

1159
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:22,839
ADHD rising out of our focus and

1160
00:51:21,079 --> 00:51:25,040
concentration

1161
00:51:22,839 --> 00:51:29,359
problems and then when the amphetamine

1162
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:33,640
wears off coffee

1163
00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:36,760
chocolate right caffeine Mach tea green

1164
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:39,559
tea or prescribed amphetamine that your

1165
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:44,680
doctor gives you when the amphetamine

1166
00:51:39,559 --> 00:51:44,680
wears off and the adrenaline comes

1167
00:51:45,359 --> 00:51:51,880
down we're

1168
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:54,359
depressed we're sad we're

1169
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:56,079
depressed we're

1170
00:51:54,359 --> 00:51:58,280
crying

1171
00:51:56,079 --> 00:52:03,440
we're

1172
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:05,839
miserable many people are just in a dark

1173
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:08,079
place and then we get back on our coffee

1174
00:52:05,839 --> 00:52:11,119
or caffeine or matcha our chocolate we

1175
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:13,680
get back on our amphetamines which is

1176
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:14,920
caffeine and then we or we go and we

1177
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:17,599
take another

1178
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:20,160
amphetamine dosage from our doctor's

1179
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:22,200
amphetamine prescription and we're back

1180
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:23,799
on top again for a little bit we're

1181
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:25,760
having a pretty good day we're back on

1182
00:52:23,799 --> 00:52:27,760
top and then adrenaline flooding

1183
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:30,280
adrenaline's flowing it's flowing and

1184
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:35,000
then it all comes crashing down and

1185
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:35,000
we're depressed and down in the

1186
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:42,880
dumps Max von says over there on YouTube

1187
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:45,720
when I quit coffee there was a period of

1188
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:48,480
time when I didn't know if I'd ever feel

1189
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:48,480
happy

1190
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:52,920
again it's a struggle it's a struggle

1191
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:57,400
not

1192
00:52:52,920 --> 00:53:00,799
easy Von says I gave up coffee amazing

1193
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:03,559
okay all right chronic viral infections

1194
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:07,359
where viruses such as Epstein bar can

1195
00:53:03,559 --> 00:53:08,839
feed off of toxic heavy metals such as

1196
00:53:07,359 --> 00:53:11,280
mercury and aluminum like we're talking

1197
00:53:08,839 --> 00:53:13,319
about before releasing neurotoxins that

1198
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:15,400
float around the bloodstream saturating

1199
00:53:13,319 --> 00:53:17,440
neurotransmitter chemicals dampening

1200
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:19,960
everything when this occurs electrical

1201
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:23,799
impulses running across neurons short

1202
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:26,520
circuit because they become polluted

1203
00:53:23,799 --> 00:53:29,359
polluted what's next now occurring is a

1204
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:31,599
new wave of dangerous chemicals being

1205
00:53:29,359 --> 00:53:32,920
produced every day by the chemical

1206
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:34,720
industry I'm trying to make it sound as

1207
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:36,520
interesting as possible because when you

1208
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:39,040
talk about the chemical IND industry it

1209
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:40,119
just doesn't sound interesting yeah the

1210
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:41,680
chemical

1211
00:53:40,119 --> 00:53:45,640
industry

1212
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:48,920
y they're doing some bad stuff out there

1213
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:50,200
chemical industry is creating a bunch of

1214
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:53,520
bad

1215
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:57,119
chemicals and those bad chemicals are

1216
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:59,680
hurting our children children hurting

1217
00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:02,280
us but what's now occurring is a new

1218
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:04,119
wave of these dangerous chemicals the

1219
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:06,160
chemical industry is pumping this [ __ ]

1220
00:54:04,119 --> 00:54:08,480
everywhere into the environment and our

1221
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:11,160
children and our pets are ingesting it

1222
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:14,000
and we inhale it these toxic chemical

1223
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:16,680
substances are adding to the viral fuel

1224
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:19,880
keeping us sick because it's like

1225
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:22,200
breathing in more dosages of

1226
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:23,480
unauthorized toxic heavy metals that are

1227
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:27,319
floating through the air and getting

1228
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:29,559
into our bloodstream in and our

1229
00:54:27,319 --> 00:54:30,760
body glad you guys love to hang around

1230
00:54:29,559 --> 00:54:32,680

longevity five best tips for longevity

1235
00:54:40,599 --> 00:54:45,119
CU only everybody has the attention span

1236
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:46,200
right now of a flea did you notice that

1237
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:48,040
you guys that everybody has the

1238
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:49,599
attention span of a flea out there so

1239
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:53,599
all they like is like quick bioh hacks

1240
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:56,680
like five five top foods for longevity

1241
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:59,520
five best ways to stay alive to live to

1242
00:54:56,680 --> 00:55:02,680
200 years old I like okay I could watch

1243
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:05,960
that for about 5 seconds or 5

1244
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:09,079
minutes all right sometimes focus and

1245
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:13,440
concentration seems to improve randomly

1246
00:55:09,079 --> 00:55:15,520
on its own and sometimes they get worse

1247
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:17,599
one theory is that the gut has

1248
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:20,480
everything to do with the brain that's a

1249
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:22,480
theory out there and so cleaning up the

1250
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:25,839
gut automatically improves mental

1251
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:28,039
Clarity yeah that's it this Theory is

1252
00:55:25,839 --> 00:55:30,119
misleading the real reason that someone

1253
00:55:28,039 --> 00:55:31,640
can focus more easily when they start

1254
00:55:30,119 --> 00:55:32,960
eating better is that they're removing

1255
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:37,599
unhealthy

1256
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:41,599
foods like viral Foods they're low

1257
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:44,400
lowering the viral consumption of the

1258
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:46,000
toxic viral food so what they're doing

1259
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:48,520
so when they're getting away from

1260
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:50,640
processed foods that have a lot of bad

1261
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:52,039
cheese and all the other garbage and

1262
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:52,960
everything else when they're starting to

1263
00:55:52,039 --> 00:55:55,640
push that

1264
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:58,039
away and they're pushing away the gluten

1265
00:55:55,640 --> 00:56:00,799
because gluten feeds viruses all of a

1266
00:55:58,039 --> 00:56:02,760
sudden there's a little bit of an

1267
00:56:00,799 --> 00:56:03,440
improvement okay let's go in just a

1268
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:05,599
little

1269
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:07,920
bit okay all

1270
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:09,559
right it's not all about cleaning up the

1271
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:11,280
intestinal tract and restoring bacterial

1272
00:56:09,559 --> 00:56:12,720
balance to the gut this is why so many

1273
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:13,839
unhealthy people with very messy

1274
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:15,680
intestinal tracts filled with

1275
00:56:13,839 --> 00:56:17,640
unproductive yeast and mold and fungus

1276
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:19,599
never had a focus and concentration

1277
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:24,359
problem ever

1278
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:26,599
ever there people with strep sitting

1279
00:56:24,359 --> 00:56:29,359
right there on the outside of their anus

1280
00:56:26,599 --> 00:56:33,760
every single day strep like three kinds

1281
00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:37,799
of strep if they took a Q-tip and stuck

1282
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:41,720
it in their rectum and try to actually

1283
00:56:37,799 --> 00:56:44,599
grow something in a Petri dish right

1284
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:46,400
okay get a culture going they would see

1285
00:56:44,599 --> 00:56:50,960
some Fierce

1286
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:53,039

01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:22,640
what this is

1466
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:24,960
today so you know when it comes down to

1467
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:27,520
CFS and chronic fatigue syndrome what I

1468
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:29,240
don't like when I don't like anybody

1469
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:32,200
suffering or struggling with it at all

1470
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:33,520
right kicking in by the way I'm just

1471
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:36,559
starting to feel

1472
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:38,760
it it's kicking in right now what I

1473
01:04:36,559 --> 01:04:41,400
don't like is when someone gets more

1474
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:43,680
than the fatigue more than the like the

1475
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:46,200
lead feel like the lead legs and the

1476
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:48,279
lead arms they're feeling the fatigue

1477
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:50,920
where they're shutting

1478
01:04:48,279 --> 01:04:53,160
down they're laying on mattress Island

1479
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:55,680
not because they're tired yeah they're

1480
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:58,240
tired but they can't sleep they're

1481
01:04:55,680 --> 01:05:01,880
laying on mattress Island awake but shut

1482
01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:04,520
down like in this place where they can't

1483
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:06,760
like function they can't talk they're

1484
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:08,240
just they're just shutting down and they

1485
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:11,680
have to do that they have to rest their

1486
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:13,520
nerves for a little while and and then

1487
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:15,760
they come out of it and they're able to

1488
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:17,839
function for a little bit and that's

1489
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:21,680
back to square one again it's such

1490
01:05:17,839 --> 01:05:21,680
serious neurological fatigue it's

1491
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:26,079
brutal yep

1492
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:30,480
mhm how fast does celery Force work with

1493
01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:33,559
you guys by the

1494
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:38,599
way like seriously like how fast is it 8

1495
01:05:33,559 --> 01:05:41,839
minutes 12 minutes 14 minutes 20

1496
01:05:38,599 --> 01:05:44,119
minutes I mean it's always it's always

1497
01:05:41,839 --> 01:05:47,559
for what I've talked to people and for

1498
01:05:44,119 --> 01:05:50,319
me that's between 5 minutes and 20

1499
01:05:47,559 --> 01:05:51,960
minutes it's like between five and 20

1500
01:05:50,319 --> 01:05:55,079
right somewhere in that

1501
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:57,440
pocket it's insane and it usually hits

1502
01:05:55,079 --> 01:05:59,480
the person at the same timeline too like

1503
01:05:57,440 --> 01:06:01,559
if they're an eight minutter then like

1504
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:03,640
it hits eight minutes so it's in eight

1505
01:06:01,559 --> 01:06:05,960
minutes if they're a 10-min it's like in

1506
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:07,640
10 minutes it's always around 10 minutes

1507
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:09,720
crazy how that

1508
01:06:07,640 --> 01:06:14,200
works yeah someday I'll talk about it

1509
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:16,440
more too all right so chronic fatigue

1510
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:20,319
syndrome big part of it is viral

1511
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:21,480
infections Epstein bar CYO Aben bar is

1512
01:06:20,319 --> 01:06:24,599
the big one

1513
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:25,720
shingles all the viral loads that bring

1514
01:06:24,599 --> 01:06:28,599
people

1515
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:30,880
down but Epstein bar is the big shining

1516
01:06:28,599 --> 01:06:33,039
star though that's the big one for

1517
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:37,400
CFS and then what comes along with

1518
01:06:33,039 --> 01:06:41,880
Epstein bar is strap so strap and

1519
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:42,640
Epstein bar their the big ticket winners

1520
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:45,240
for

1521
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:48,359
CFS and then if you got chronic fatigue

1522
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:50,520
syndrome that's really really bad and

1523
01:06:48,359 --> 01:06:51,920
you're dealing with the viral issue and

1524
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:54,680
the bacterial

1525
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:56,880
issue and your immune system is dogging

1526
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:58,880
it your immune cells are dogging it they

1527
01:06:56,880 --> 01:07:01,400
can't keep up with the bacteria the

1528
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:03,599
strep they can't keep up with the virus

1529
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:06,839
they can't keep up and then as that's

1530
01:07:03,599 --> 01:07:08,960
happening you might also have metals and

1531
01:07:06,839 --> 01:07:10,839
when you got metals like aluminum and

1532
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:14,079
Mercury that's just some aluminum foil

1533
01:07:10,839 --> 01:07:16,880
right there couped with all that in your

1534
01:07:14,079 --> 01:07:19,319
body and then the domestic Invaders like

1535
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:21,599
all the fragrances giving you more stuff

1536
01:07:19,319 --> 01:07:25,440
challenges for the immune system we end

1537
01:07:21,599 --> 01:07:28,319
up with severe severe CR chronic fatigue

1538
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:29,960
syndrome and yeah Rachel says sorry

1539
01:07:28,319 --> 01:07:33,440
Force makes me

1540
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:35,119
tired okay but do after that are you one

1541
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:37,680
of those where it makes you tired like

01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:44,440
and then you're more more Sparky later

1544
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:46,799
it's actually feeding the brain helping

1545
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:50,079
it to strengthen and then you're more

1546
01:07:46,799 --> 01:07:52,520

twisted ankle and experiences aute pain

1612
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:05,760

01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:07,719
straightforward

1614
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:10,199
straightforward some pain comes from

1615
01:11:07,719 --> 01:11:11,960
injuries accidents or incidents and

1616
01:11:10,199 --> 01:11:14,320
there's no mystery

1617
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:16,199
involved what's very different is if

1618
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:18,400

01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:39,199
four years from now maybe a little

1646
01:12:37,159 --> 01:12:41,520
further down the road but it's all

1647
01:12:39,199 --> 01:12:43,840
you're going to hear everybody's going

1648
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:45,760

01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:50,600
to do shock and all like influencers are

1652
01:12:49,199 --> 01:12:53,080
going to be like you should stay away

1653
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:54,880
from eggs science now says eggs are bad

01:12:57,360 --> 01:13:01,400
a jerk I'm I'm not following you anymore

1657
01:12:59,480 --> 01:13:02,440
I'm unfollowing you it's going to happen

1658
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:05,320
like every day down the

1659
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:09,360
[Music]

1660
01:13:05,320 --> 01:13:12,239
road meanwhile I've been crucified for

1661
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:14,520
it nailed to the

1662
01:13:12,239 --> 01:13:17,199
cross the real cause of this chronic

1663
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:21,000
fatigue and chronic pain and all that

1664
01:13:17,199 --> 01:13:24,280
muscle pain and aches acute pain that's

1665
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:27,440
not from banging into a wall or the

1666
01:13:24,280 --> 01:13:31,040
corner of a door jam and you bang into

1667
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:33,159
it is viral infections ly says it just

1668
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:36,159
took my accelery force it helps me get

1669
01:13:33,159 --> 01:13:39,199
sharp and on my aame at

1670
01:13:36,159 --> 01:13:43,280
work is it 8 minutes 12 minutes 10

1671
01:13:39,199 --> 01:13:43,280
minutes when does it kick in for

1672
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:50,719
you okay viruses sit in the

1673
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:53,320
liver they actually released

1674
01:13:50,719 --> 01:13:55,400
neurotoxins viruses also spread through

1675
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:57,040
throughout the body they get into areas

1676
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:59,199
on

1677
01:13:57,040 --> 01:14:01,679
nerves and so let's do a little thing on

1678
01:13:59,199 --> 01:14:01,679
that really

1679
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:08,120
quick all right give me a quick second

1680
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:16,080
here

1681
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:19,320
okay so got a Vegas nerves some Vegas

1682
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:19,320
nerves here coming out of the brain

1683
01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:25,280
stem

1684
01:14:28,159 --> 01:14:34,840
got a little bit of a Vegas nerve here

1685
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:39,560
okay viruses feed off of foods like

1686
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:43,320
eggs that's what they do all

1687
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:46,560
right wherever that bug went I will grab

1688
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:50,360
it right here feeds off of eggs when we

1689
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:53,880
eat eggs so we eat them they go into our

1690
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:57,560
body they become fuel the undeveloped

1691
01:14:53,880 --> 01:15:01,320
proteins feed bugs viruses specifically

1692
01:14:57,560 --> 01:15:05,520
they love them bacteria too okay

1693
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:10,040
so when the virus releases the

1694
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:14,560
egg in a neurotoxin base okay virus

1695
01:15:10,040 --> 01:15:18,920
releases an egg in a neurotoxin base the

1696
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:18,920
neurotoxins so let's make a little virus

1697
01:15:19,880 --> 01:15:23,800
here so we got a virus in the body right

1698
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:27,040
there

1699
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:30,600
another virus in the body Epstein bar

1700
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:33,159
Epstein bar is a big one for muscles and

1701
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:35,400
Joints epine bar

1702
01:15:33,159 --> 01:15:38,120
baby

1703
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:40,760
yep all these Epstein bar

1704
01:15:38,120 --> 01:15:42,760
viruses it's a lot of different epor

1705
01:15:40,760 --> 01:15:45,040
viruses people collect a lot of them now

1706
01:15:42,760 --> 01:15:49,960
they don't realize

1707
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:52,159
it all right so when those viruses eat

1708
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:52,159
the

1709
01:15:52,199 --> 01:15:59,239
egg because you ate the

1710
01:15:56,520 --> 01:16:03,320
egg a poison comes

1711
01:15:59,239 --> 01:16:06,000
out of the virus that poison see it come

1712
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:08,320
out of the viruses here that

1713
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:12,840
poison is

1714
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:15,960
in highly allergenic poison that hits

1715
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:21,000
the Vagas nerve when it hits the Vagas

1716
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:24,880
nerve different areas we can feel pain

1717
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:28,480
in the strangest places

1718
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:31,719
now if it hits the frenic

1719
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:33,920
nerves some frenic nerves in our body

1720
01:16:31,719 --> 01:16:37,719
right in the Fric nerves frenic nerves

1721
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:40,960
right here okay

1722
01:16:37,719 --> 01:16:44,239
right hits those frenic nerves right

1723
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:47,760
here we can have pain anywhere

1724
01:16:44,239 --> 01:16:50,600
shoulders crazy

1725
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:53,600
places we can have pain

1726
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:55,400
everywhere tibial nerve do a little

1727
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:58,600
tibial nerve down

1728
01:16:55,400 --> 01:17:02,679
here that's

1729
01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:06,960
right we can have pain in the craziest

1730
01:17:02,679 --> 01:17:09,600
places right the virus feeds on the food

1731
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:10,840
it likes this little egg right here

1732
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:13,560
releases

1733
01:17:10,840 --> 01:17:16,679
neurotoxins they hit nerves all through

1734
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:19,560
the body nerves that go to joints and so

1735
01:17:16,679 --> 01:17:22,000
forth connected tissue around the joints

1736
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:23,920
and now we're in pain mysteriously in

1737
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:26,199
pain

1738
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:29,120
regardless of your diagnosis ongoing

1739
01:17:26,199 --> 01:17:32,320
joint and muscle pain is viral that's a

1740
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:35,560
strong bold statement from Spirit of

1741
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:37,560
compassion these are not my words in the

1742
01:17:35,560 --> 01:17:41,600
books

1743
01:17:37,560 --> 01:17:44,760
okay s so's words in the

1744
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:46,679
book and if someone doesn't like that

1745
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:49,679
well 10 years down the road when all

1746
01:17:46,679 --> 01:17:52,000
their bioh hacks didn't work for them

1747
01:17:49,679 --> 01:17:53,840
and they were and their scale finally

1748
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,719
tipped

1749
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:57,520
and

1750
01:17:54,719 --> 01:18:00,360
they're having real problems with their

1751
01:17:57,520 --> 01:18:02,320
health and no influencer can kind of

1752
01:18:00,360 --> 01:18:05,400
