00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,440
even even using your cleanse

74
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,360
what what else are you doing is it just

75
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,760
a cleanse did you do

76
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,640
one cleanse did you do a little

77
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,000
cleansing

78
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:56,640
have you did the 369 advance

79
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,519
have you done that so that's something

80
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,040
to

81
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:03,360
think about um how much fat are you on

82
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,280
that's another thing too when you get

83
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,120
off the cleanse are you tanking the fats

84
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,640
are you taking the nuts and seeds nut

85
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,440

i'm cutting the cauliflower in half

90
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,840
these these little

91
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,840
florets right here

92
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:29,200
and is your histamine issue

93
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:31,680
really part of your issue that's another

94
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,840
thing too

95
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,440
is it just is it something someone's

96
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,040
just told you about hey you got high

97
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,080
histamines that could be your problem

98
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,519
are you

99
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,080

so you're dealing with a viral problem

102
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,000
and you got a lot of symptoms

103
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,760

107
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,040

129
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:43,840
in here

130
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,840
so this is on amazon.com

131
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,280
link is in the description

132
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,160
so i got some cauliflower some asparagus

133
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,440
going here so if you guys just got on

134
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,560
here everybody coming on here going to

135
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,960
talk about

136
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,880
um i'm going to talk about gluten going

137
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,479
to talk about b12 going to talk about

138
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,919
eggs i'm going to talk about apple cider

139
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,360
vinegar and other vinegars

140
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,440
that's just some of the stuff and cover

141
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,639
caffeine a little bit again so we're

142
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,840
going to cover a whole bunch of

143
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,600
different things

144
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,000
lots of stuff to talk about when it

145
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,080
comes down to histamines

146
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,600
the reason why someone has a histamine

147
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,400
problem is because they're viral

148
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,120
so you got to keep that in mind so if

149
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,720
someone

150
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:25,120
is viral low-grade viral infections

151
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,919
then your histamines raise and then what

152
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,320
happens is

153
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:30,400
the foods they're really just kind of a

154
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,800
confusion they become a confusion

155
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,639
in in it all but first of all certain

156
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:38,240
foods will feed the viruses

157
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,960
creating more histamines so and certain

158
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,759
foods will

159
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:44,560
kill the epstein-barr virus in shingles

160
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:48,080
virus cytomegalovirus simplex one virus

161
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,680
causing histamines so if if histamines

162
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,440
is something that you're monitoring or

163
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,120
someone's looking after your doctor's

164
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,479
looking after these histamines and

165
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,800
they're all worried about histamines

166
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:58,800
histamines but they don't know

167
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,560
what is happening like what's causing

168
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,360
the histamines why are these histamines

169
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,840
happening

170
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,600
so if you're eating foods to feed

171
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,160
pathogens like epstein-barr shingle

172
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,319
sediment

173
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:12,880
virus hhv6 hhv7 simplex one simplex two

174
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:15,360
and the list goes on if you're eating

175
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,639
foods to feed some of these bugs in your

176
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,000
body

177
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:23,520
then histamines raise right

178
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,720
then when you eat foods to cleanse these

179
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,880
bugs out

180
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,479
histamines raise because you're

181
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,240
cleansing and shaking up all that

182
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:31,360
garbage and toxic stuff that's sitting

183
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,520
inside your liver

184
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,479
so if you're trying a little bit of a

185
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,319
cleanse like

186
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:37,759
like the cleanse the heel one of one of

187
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,560
the cleanses or you're doing a little

188
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,639
3-6-9

189
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,400
and you're not sure where to go it takes

190
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,000
time because that liver is really mucky

191
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,680
really dirty filled with all kinds of

192
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,600
toxins filled with all kinds of bugs

193
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,560
with all kinds of pathogens

194
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,840
and it's just it's stocked up in there

195
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,280
and then what happens when you start

196
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,560
cleansing and cleansing it out you're

197
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,080
getting all that garbage out and that

198
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,759
could raise your histamines

199
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,280
just like the histamines were raised to

200
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:02,080
begin with because of all that garbage

201
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,840
building up

202
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,360
invite the light said i think i i think

203
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,599
potatoes bother me

204
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,360
bummer i'm making a potato dish making a

205
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:10,800
leafy green salad if you want to just

206
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,479
keep the cauliflower

207
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,840
and the asparagus in there without the

208
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:18,000
potato you're welcome to

209
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:21,039
um but potatoes

210
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,520
don't feed bugs it's really healing food

211
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:27,360
healing food on the digestive system

212
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,360
um very healing

213
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,960
what other foods are you eating invite

214
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,960
the light is there anything else

215
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,400
you you know you're doing you're staying

216
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,599
away from vinegar staying away from the

217
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,319
nutritional yeast right

218
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,759
staying away from those things um stay

219
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,360
away from gluten of course you're off

220
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,639
the caffeine right staying away from the

221
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,599
caffeine so you don't burn out the

222
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,520
adrenals

223
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:48,319
staying off the milk cheese eggs butter

224
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,319
all that's gone

225
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:57,280
and any new pharmaceuticals happening a

226
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,120
lot of people

227
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,039
they'll do new pharmaceuticals and all

228
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,479
of a sudden something's going on and

229
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:03,919
they're like what is it is it my food

230
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:05,280
meanwhile they had a new pharmaceutical

231
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:08,479
going on

232
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:10,240
so i got this about the steam up

233
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:13,840
lightly steaming some cauliflower got

234
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,840
some asparagus right here

235
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:18,560
so another thing about histamines if you

236
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,080
have old pharmaceuticals sitting inside

237
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,919
your liver and organs

238
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,840
you got benzodiazepines in there you got

239
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:26,720
old cold medicines in there antibiotics

240
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,160
anti-inflammatories whatever you have

241
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,840
that's still anti-depressants

242
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,599
anti-anxiety meds whatever you have

243
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,680
that's sitting in your liver

244
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:35,039
that stuff starts to come out those

245
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:38,399
histamines go up

246
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:41,440
up and histamine levels are kind of like

247
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:43,200
keeping an eye on just a marker like

248
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,399
what's going on inside the body nobody

249
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:49,279
knows but the histamines up

250
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,839
glad you guys are coming on there's no

251
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,920
oil

252
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:54,320
in this steaming it up just got some

253
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,320
water in the pan

254
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,279
waiting for that to get hot so i'm going

255
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:01,519
to start cutting some leafy greens

256
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:03,279
and making this out i got some spinach

257
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,720
right here

258
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:06,720
you can leave them whole leaf i'm just

259
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,440
going to chop them up a little bit

260
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,360
because this is a really big salad so

261
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:14,800
it'll help to

262
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,800
make it a little smaller in a way

263
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,959
you guys ready to talk about some stuff

264
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,880
let me just get some spinach in this

265
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,880
bowl right here

266
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,240
you guys have you ever noticed when i'm

267
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:35,120
making meals for you

268
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,760
it's rare there's a fat in the meal

269
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,440
right

270
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,920
you don't see any cheese thrown on top

271
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,839
of here which is fat you don't see eggs

272
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,200
thrown on top of here hard-boiled eggs

273
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:45,760
right you don't see that

274
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,519
okay you don't see any nut butters you

275
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,040
don't see tahini on here

276
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,120
you don't see avocado it's not that

277
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,920
avocado's bad for you avocado's not bad

278
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,080
for you

279
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:56,480
it's just you don't see that because

280
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:59,360
here's the thing everybody is eating fat

281
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,480
all day long almost every single meal

282
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,640
they eat

283
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,160
has a fat in it right and then their

284
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,440
livers get burdened down and they get

285
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,079
the weight later and they get the

286
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,760
stagnant

287
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:09,760
sluggish liver they get the depression

288
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,120
the metals oxidized they got all kinds

289
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:14,800
of problems

290
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:18,079
and what happens here is

291
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:20,720
the reason why i do all these no fat

292
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:22,160
meals i'm hoping that you guys maybe

293
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,120
make one and you're like hey that was

294
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,519
really good i didn't

295
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,200
need to drown that with oil i didn't

296
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,600
need to drown that with

297
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,720
you know lots of nut butter or avocado i

298
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,800
didn't need to put

299
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,160
cheese on top or anything like that so

300
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,839
i'm putting spinach in here i just

301
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,600
chopped up some spinach right here

302
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,040
so leafy greens are critical these are

303
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,120
trace mineral salts just so you know

304
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,880
this goes to the brain

305
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:46,079
this is good for the brain which is

306
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:48,240
leading me to the egg topic pretty soon

307
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,120
um i just want to show you guys how to

308
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,399
make healing

309
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,200
meals that don't have vinegar loads of

310
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,600
salt

311
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,880
all these fats all these oils all this

312
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,600
nutritional yeast

313
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,399
i want you guys to have a chance to heal

314
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,560
and not be

315
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,399
have to inundate yourself on all with

316
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:07,839
all this stuff in there like

317
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:10,640
vinegars and fats and oils and salts and

318
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:12,000
like because i want you guys to have a

319
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,320
chance to really heal

320
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,079
learn how to heal take care of yourself

321
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:19,760
i don't want to throw all that stuff in

322
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:19,760
this stuff then you guys don't heal

323
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,640
i'm going to chop up a little bit of

324
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,320
parsley right here why is nutritional

325
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:27,600
yeast bad

326
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:29,440
it's a neural antagonist it's irritating

327
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,360
on the nerves it's irritating on the

328
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,200
central nervous system it's irritating

329
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:36,240
on neurons

330
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,240
nutritional yeast

331
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,160
has a glutamic acid naturally embedded

332
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,320
into it

333
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,920
that's just one reason why it's it's not

334
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:48,480
that good

335
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:52,000
that glutamic acid attaches itself

336
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:54,160
to neurons wreaking havoc

337
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,680
okay okay i'll give you a couple other

338
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,000
things it does all right let's go into

339
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,440
that

340
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,040
let's talk about nutritional yeast a

341
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,279
little bit that was on my list today by

342
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,279
the way

343
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,880
chopping up parsley it's going in my

344
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,399
leafy leafy green salad if you guys just

345
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:10,639
came on here i got cauliflower i got

346
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:11,920
asparagus steaming up in here so

347
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,760
just going to kind of move it around a

348
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:16,240
little bit i got this steaming up

349
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,839
this is going to go on top of the salad

350
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,320
it's going to lightly lightly steam

351
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,600
these

352
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,480
for a little while nutritional yeast not

353
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,079
only has

354
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,079
a natural glutamic acid

355
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:34,800
that's a problem putting some

356
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,800
parsley in the salad

357
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,440
it's also an irritant to the intestinal

358
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,200
lining

359
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,200
so nutritional yeast is an irritant to

360
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,800
the intestinal lining if you want ibs

361
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,839
and digestive problems to get worse due

362
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,480
to nutritional yeast

363
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,839
it's one thing right there these are

364
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,120
sunflower sprouts

365
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:52,560
if you guys just came on we're going to

366
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,040
be hammering nutritional yeast for a

367
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,040
little while

368
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,200
so sunflower sprouts these are really

369
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:02,079
pretty

370
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,519
right don't they look great i'm going to

371
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:05,600
chop up some of these put these in a

372
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:07,360
salad

373
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,120
here's another reason why nutritional

374
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,519
yeast really stinks everybody says b12

375
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,720
is a nutritional yeast b12 b12 no they

376
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,680
add it

377
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,320
and they add a really bad one so they

378
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,600
add a

379
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:22,399
toxic type of b12 a synthetic b12

380
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:25,040
that's toxic that's what they add so you

381
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:29,200
got to think about this right

382
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:32,800
my acupuncturist says heavy metal detox

383
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:35,600
smoothie is too cold for me and it's

384
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,560
quenching my digestion fire i use frozen

385
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,760
bananas

386
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,959
boy there's a lot of science and

387
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,959
research in that one huh

388
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,440
i wonder what scientific study or test

389
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:46,079
determines your fire and your gut as

390
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,120
being

391
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:50,320
being quenching you're firing your guts

392
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,680
being quenching by

393
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,680
the heavy metal detox smoothie

394
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:01,440
look i'm not gonna pick on your

395
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,360
acupuncturist okay

396
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,959
but i've talked to thousands of them in

397
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:09,120
the last 35 years

398
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:11,279
and their training is about hot and cold

399
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,959
liver heat dampness spleen dampness

400
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:16,160
pancreas dampness

401
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:17,199
fire okay and so that's what their

402
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,880
training's in

403
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:22,320
right and i'm not ranking on that at all

404
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,880
i got a lot of close friends that are

405
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,800
acupuncturists with three decades of

406
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:30,800
practice underneath them

407
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:33,920
it's not not it

408
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:37,279
it's just that i always go by one rule

409
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:40,720
and one rule only do you know

410
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:42,639
why someone is really sick because

411
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,720
millions of people have been at two

412
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:47,839
their acupuncturists

413
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:52,480
and haven't recovered from severe lupus

414
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:55,680
multiple sclerosis okay crohn's colitis

415
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,560
eczema psoriasis i have not seen a

416
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,959
severe

417
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,480
case of eczema one where the person's

418
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:02,160
raging with eczema

419
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,399
and they can't live their life i have

420
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:08,160
not seen that dampest spleen

421
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:08,160
hot cold fire

422
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,079
fix it whether they're taking away cold

423
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,160
foods

424
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:16,000
putting in hot foods never seen because

425
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,360
the reason why unless you know why

426
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,480
someone has eczema

427
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,320
unless you know why someone has

428
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,920
psoriasis you can play all the guessing

429
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,680
games you want

430
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,120
and it's not going to fix somebody i

431
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,480
can't tell you how many people with

432
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,600
raging eczema has laid

433
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:32,000
they've laid on an acupuncturist table

434
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,320
suffered through the needles told to

435
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,639
stay away from anything cold because of

436
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,959
dampness in the spleen

437
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:40,800
and that and then they just that wasn't

438
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:44,399
an answer

439
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,399
i'm not trying to be difficult

440
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:51,600
i got a lot of respect for practitioners

441
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,600
of all kinds

442
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,839
a lot of respect

443
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,160
what i would do is the first thing i

444
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:05,440
would do is don't have it icy cold

445
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,440
defrost the blueberries

446
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,759
but see your acupuncturist might not

447
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:11,360
want you doing raw foods

448
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:13,120
so that might be an issue too a lot of

449
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,240
acupuncturists be like no only cook

450
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:18,800
don't do anything raw

451
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:22,000
no raw foods only cook only cooked

452
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:24,000
so a lot of a lot of um

453
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,680
acupuncturists might do that but if if

454
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
the concern is about it being

455
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,720
cold have the wild blueberries out

456
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,880
overnight

457
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,560
let them defrost let them become room

458
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:37,839
temperature make sure your bananas are

459
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:37,839
room temperature

460
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,800
does your acupuncturist know that if you

461
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,480
have toxic heavy metals it causes

462
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,399
anxiety depression no they don't

463
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,839
because they had never been taught that

464
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:49,920
so

465
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,519
if you have anxiety depression bipolar

466
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:54,079
ocd parkinson's

467
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:55,759
memory issues alzheimer's dementia the

468
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:59,440
list goes on to personalization

469
00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:01,759
that's caused by toxic heavy metals so

470
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:05,839
the thing is is like i'm not saying you

471
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:07,600
have one of those conditions but if you

472
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,880
if you go to an acupuncturist and they

473
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,600
say you can't have

474
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,799
a smoothie because of dampness of the

475
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,160
spleen or something

476
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:16,079
and you're sitting there with severe

477
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,240
depression anxiety to personalization

478
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:21,439
alzheimer's dementia

479
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:23,120
you're not going to get any help because

480
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,640
you got to get the medals out but the

481
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,000
acupuncturist doesn't know that you need

482
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,880
to get your metals out you see how it

483
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,160
works

484
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,160
just think about that a little bit

485
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:35,520
i've never met an acupuncturist in 35

486
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,679
years of doing this work that knew about

487
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,360
viruses

488
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,880
they know about them now through the

489
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,240
work of the medical medium and all the

490
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,080
books that are out there millions of

491
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,000
books getting out there

492
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,120
but they never knew i'll tell you i'll

493
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,400
tell you i talked to the best

494
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,080
acupuncturist schools

495
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:53,039
some of the leaders in the best actual

496
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:56,480
acupuncture schools in the last 35 years

497
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:58,000
they didn't know viruses caused anything

498
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,280
they didn't know about the epstein-barr

499
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,640
virus and what it caused they didn't

500
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,840
know about shingles and what it caused

501
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,360
trigeminal neuralgia

502
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,280
they didn't know chronic fatigue

503
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,440
syndrome me they didn't know multiple

504
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:10,080
sclerosis was caused by epstein-barr

505
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:12,400
i've talked to leaders of the movement

506
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:16,000
over the last 35 years in acupuncture

507
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:17,840
schools and and they didn't know what

508
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,440
causes those things they were kind of

509
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,160
like just trained in one way where it's

510
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,080

got total respect for that i'm not i'm

517
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:36,720
that's not i'm not judging anybody

518
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,280
it's just that i've had to teach a lot a

519
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,160
lot of

520
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,799
high ranking people in the field of that

521
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,039
medicine

522
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:44,559
about viruses and why their patients

523
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:46,480
were suffering with chronic fatigue

524
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:50,000
syndrome fibromyalgia

this is steaming up it's coming out good

528
00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:00,160
a little longer than that

529
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,160
um

530
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:04,320

the real issues to get better

535
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,520

00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,240
i had to talk to 250 000 individuals

537
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:24,320
one-on-one

538
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,480
before the publications of medical media

539
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:28,000
medical medium books

540
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,840
and they already went to every single

541
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,799
practice some 30 doctors and different

542
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,840
practitioners some

i even i'm even doing what i'm doing all

545
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:40,000

nutritionists and naturopaths

548
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:45,840

00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,320
tingles and numbness aches and pains

550
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:50,160

00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,080
answers

554
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,400
you don't think i've heard that a

555
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,240
million times don't drink a smoothie a

556
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:06,320
cold smoothie because it's gonna

557
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:07,679
blow your fire out all right well

558
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,840
don't eat a smoothie that's going to

559
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,880
help get the metals out kill off viruses

560
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:14,080
and clean things up

561
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,080
so you can actually get better

562

your oxygen

662
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:58,559

00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,960
will give you a heart attack eventually

751
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:22,480
fill your heart up with cholesterol

752
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:24,399
now science says eggs are good for you

753
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:26,720
so what do you want to verify because

754
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:29,440
science stomps on itself constantly it

755
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:31,919
changes every year

756
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:34,320
so i'm confused are you trying to verify

757
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:36,559
something so that

758
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,679
it can be changed in one year from

759
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:39,360
another study

760
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:41,919
or change in six months because no

761
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,720
studies they all they're all stomped on

762
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:45,039
each other

763
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,240
they're com they're all run over by the

764
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:48,159
next science study

765
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,760
every six months by the next one every

766
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:50,399
year there's not one science study you

767
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,640
could actually

768
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:54,399
hold or talk about that hasn't been

769
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:57,600
stomped on

770
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:57,600
just shortly after

771
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:02,240
so what's happening is there's a whole

772
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:05,760
bunch of studies out there that that

773
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:07,279
are null and void you know do you ever

774
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:09,039
avoid a check

775
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:10,480
do you ever write a check and you wrote

776
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:11,679
it wrong and you were trying to write a

777
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,039
check and you wrote a wrote

778
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:15,200
wrong in your checkbook and then you

779
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:17,279
wrote void across it

780
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,880
well that's what science is it's a big

781
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:20,960
void

782
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,880
every single study has void written

783
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:25,200
across it a year later

784
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:27,039
every last one of them every food study

785
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:31,840
has void written over it

786
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:31,840
every single study

787
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,960
i want to know i want to know when are

788
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,320
they going to come up with that study of

789
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,080
why everybody's sick in the united

790
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,440
states and globally why everybody's sick

791
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:41,520
with the symptom and condition and

792
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,200
there's no answers

793
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:45,440
do you think everybody wants to be sick

794
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:48,720
because it do you think

795
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,760
the 250 million americans that are

796
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,080
really sick

797
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:53,520
right in this country do you think they

798
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:55,440
want to be sick

799
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:57,360
and they just don't want to embark on

800
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,640
what science has to offer to get them

801
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,720
healed and better

802
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,399
is that what it is do you think 250

803
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,279
million americans never went to go see

804
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:05,440
their doctor

805
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:06,640
because they don't want science to help

806
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:09,039
them no

807
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,640
they do they want science to help them

808
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:12,480
they're desperate everybody is

809
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:15,520
and science doesn't help them everybody

810
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:18,080
stays sick so

811
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:20,000
the six billion people on this planet

812
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,840
that have symptoms actually probably six

813
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,720
and a half billion people's honest on

814
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,799
the planet

815
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,240
that have symptoms and conditions do you

816
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:28,240
think they

817
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:30,000
don't want science to help them do you

818
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,679
think they just want to stay sick

819
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,840
six and a half billion people just want

820
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:37,360
to stay sick

821
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,360
i want to know where that study is

822
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:42,159
and here's the other thing no matter how

823
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,159
or what you say

824
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:45,279
science only has one answer a couple

825
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:47,360
little answers

826
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:49,200
it's it's your genes and that's why

827
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,000
you're sick it's your body attacking

828
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,559
itself

829
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,240
autoimmune your body's destroying itself

830
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:56,159
that that's an answer

831
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:58,240
the other answer is maybe hormones if

832
00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:00,559
you're lucky that's an answer

833
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,559
um

834
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,640
and here's the new one from alternative

835
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,480
science by the way

836
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:08,480
here's a great one from alternative

837
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,880
science you're creating it with your

838
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,880
thoughts

839
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,640
you're sick because you're making

840
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:17,279
yourself sick

841
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,960
because you're you want yourself sick

842
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:19,520
that's the alternative medicine new

843
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,679
thought

844
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:23,039
that's their new science they believe

845
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:24,720
that you want to be sick

846
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:26,080
that you're making yourself sick with

847
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,440
your thoughts you're not good enough

848
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,000
you're not thinking good enough you're

849
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,520
not

850
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,360
you're not doing you're not mastering

851
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,559
your mind that's why you're sick so what

852
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,840
science are you talking about you talk

853
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:34,960
about alternative science because they

854
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,000
just believe you're sick because you're

855
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,159
not mastering your mind

856
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,120
now or is it conventional science which

857
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:42,960
just believes it's your genes

858
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,830
but no i but i love i love the question

859
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,000
i love the science stuff

860
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:47,760
[Music]

861
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,360
meanwhile it's not everything else it's

862
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:51,120
not the toxic heavy metals the mercury

863
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:53,200
aluminum cadmium lead

864
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,799
nickel that's in your brain it's not the

865
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,080
radiation falling out of the sky it's

866
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:57,760
not the radiation

867
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,840
on your plane flight that's more than an

868
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,039
hour it's not the radiation when you go

869
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,440
through the airport and you get

870
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:05,360
completely contaminated with radiation

871
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:07,600
your luggage is glowing

872
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,960
your luggage luggage is glowing and then

873
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,399
you're poisoning your children because

874
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:12,000
your luggage is sitting next to your

875
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:14,480
children after it's gone through the

876
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,480
machine

877
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:20,720
it's not that it's not the viruses and

878
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,240
bacteria that are eating people up alive

879
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,200
out there it's why they can't function

880
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,120
and they're sick

881
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,799
it's not the metals feeding the viruses

882
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:28,159
so people can't function either it's not

883
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:30,559
any of that no

884
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:32,240
science is so smart it's your genes

885
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:35,120
science is so smart it's your body

886
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,120
attacking itself

887
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,080
it's not all the caffeine you're doing

888
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:40,159
because it's the number one food group

889
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:41,679
next to eggs

890
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:43,279
so it's not all the caffeine and eggs

891
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:44,880
you're doing that's your food group

892
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:46,720
that's everybody's number one food group

893
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,320
it's eggs and caffeine it's not that

894
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:52,080
that's not why you're sick

895
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:52,080
i better find some science fast

896
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:56,720
science is gonna save us science is

897
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,640
gonna save us oh my god they're gonna

898
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:00,320
save us i'm a dog waiting for a bone

899
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,760
science is going to save us is it

900
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:03,279
another study coming around the corner

901
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:06,080
because i've been sick for 20 years with

902
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:06,080
hashimoto's

903
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:15,840
[Music]

904
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:15,840
anyway all right we're making a salad

905
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:20,480
you know it's incredible how everybody

906
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:23,760
is waiting for science to save them

907
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,480
with chronic illness ask anybody with

908
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:27,840
raging

909
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:29,840
eczema psoriasis did science save them

910
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:31,440
what about vitiligo did science save

911
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:34,559
them

912
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:37,360
what about multiple sclerosis about

913
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:37,360
parkinson's

914
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:42,399
i mean we got great surgeons and your

915
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:43,200
gallbladder explodes you need a good

916
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:45,679
surgeon

917
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,519
absolutely but i'm talking about chronic

918
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:48,880
illness with everybody walking around

919
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:50,640
like wounded soldiers

920
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:52,320
can't find answers they're just

921
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:55,039
suffering fatigue

922
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:56,000
depression anxiety they can't function

923
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:58,159
they don't feel good

924
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:01,440
body aches and pains dizziness skin

925
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:01,440
problems skin disorders

926
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,880
anyway here's what happened with eggs so

927
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:11,440
let's talk about eggs for a little bit

928
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:15,519
i think it's time so eggs were used

929
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:18,640
in labs many years ago to feed viruses

930
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:22,880
so that's what happened so eggs

931
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:25,840
were used against us they took the egg

932
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:27,360
right actually a survival food i have

933
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:29,360
nothing against eggs

934
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:31,279
i thought it was a good survival food

935
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:33,679
you know for like for centuries

936
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:35,200
because people could survive on it but

937
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:38,640
in the 1920s

938
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:41,200
1930s right around the 1920s actually a

939
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:44,559
little before that they took the egg

940
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:47,760
and they decided to use it

941
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:51,279
to raise bugs in the labs so

942
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:55,279
your herpes simplex 1

943
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:58,880
was raised in the lab your cold sore

944
00:33:55,279 --> 00:34:00,960
is patented it's raised in a lab

945
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,640
it might be a mutated version now you

946
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:05,679
might not be patting it anymore

947
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:07,760
the original ones were patented

948
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:10,159
so your herpes simplex one your herpes

949
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:11,919
simplex 2 your epstein var your sediment

950
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:14,079
virus your shingles whatever it is

951
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:15,679
that's causing all your conditions they

952
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:18,879
were raised in labs

953
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:21,280
on eggs so they took an egg

954
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:23,040
and they fed that it's they actually

955
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,919
they cracked open the top they open the

956
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,919
top they put

957
00:34:23,919 --> 00:34:27,760
they put the viruses in the viruses and

958
00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:29,280
the bacteria the streptococcus

959
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,960
they learn how to grow them they learn

960
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,560
how to keep them

961
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,159
and now epstein-barr has over 60

962
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,839
varieties of mutations

963
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:37,440
shingles has over 30 varieties of

964
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:39,280
mutations as the years went on

965
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,839
everybody passing them around you know

966
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,879
around generations of passing them down

967
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:46,560
through utero

968
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:46,560
generations and passing them down

969
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,159
from from spreading them generations of

970
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,159
of

971
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:54,079
you know drinking off somebody else's

972
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:57,040
bottle drinking off somebody else's

973
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:59,839
glass oops now i got epstein barr

974
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:01,280
going into a public bathroom having the

975
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:04,079
water underneath splash

976
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:05,520
up splashed up your butt and now you got

977
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:07,359
streptococcus

978
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:09,520
now you've got strep throat a month

979
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:11,280
later and you're at the doctor's office

980
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:13,119
nobody knows why you have strep throat

981
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:15,520
everything was going okay

982
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:16,560
now you got a uti now you got chronic

983
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,320
sinusitis

984
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,520
now you got bladder infections now you

985
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,800
got yeast infections which is

986
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:24,400
streptococcus

987
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:27,599
um so the eggs raised

988
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:28,320
the bugs that were released out into the

989
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:31,520
world

990
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:32,240
that we have within us so the simplex

991
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:34,800
one

992
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:36,160
that was created from the egg so you

993
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,800
love eggs so much

994
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:45,119
but the eggs just feed that bug and then

995
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:46,880
causes more trouble as time goes on

996
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:50,000
all right so the this is good these are

997
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:53,119
steamed down good

998
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,119
i'm gonna shut this off

999
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:58,400
hey i just saw something this guy is

1000
00:35:56,839 --> 00:36:01,520
fear-mongering

1001
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:03,839
it's pretty funny you say that

1002
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:06,960
were all those women that had anxiety

1003
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:10,240
back in the 50s 60s 70s and 80s

1004
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:13,200
and they were they were knocked out

1005
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:14,880
thrown on a table probes stuck up their

1006
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,560
sinuses up their nose the front of their

1007
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,000
brain taking off of them taking off of

1008
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,440
them was called the lobotomy because you

1009
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,720
had anxiety

1010
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:24,400
hundreds of thousands of women had the

1011
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:27,839
front of their brain removed

1012
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,839
because they had anxiety

1013
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:33,599
you just don't like truth that's all if

1014
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:36,800
you don't like truth

1015
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:38,960
i get it so you know what stay on your

1016
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:41,040
caffeine

1017
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,880
you know believe that the world is

1018
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:45,359
perfect

1019
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,640
if you want don't worry about all the

1020
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:48,000
people who are suffering sick with

1021
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,800
chronic illness who can't live their

1022
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,920
lives

1023
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,920
and they have no answers

1024
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:59,440
but you know what lorraine l says it's

1025
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:01,359
truth mongering more like it

1026
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:04,320
it's about getting people better so you

1027
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:07,040
actually have information

1028
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:09,280
look if you got chronic etis chronic

1029
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:11,200
bladder infections if you've got cfs

1030
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:13,599
you've got fibromyalgia if you've got

1031
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:15,200
lupus if you've got any kind of disorder

1032
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:16,960
and you're eating eggs wouldn't you want

1033
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,320
to know that if you stopped eating the

1034
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:20,720
eggs you're one

1035
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:22,480
more step closer to healing and getting

1036
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:24,400
better or should i be worried about fear

1037
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:26,000
mongering and be like no then just eat

1038
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,599
your eggs don't don't come out with the

1039
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,920
truth don't help people don't talk to

1040
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:29,920
people

1041
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:34,400
all right so let's keep on making this

1042
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,920
so i'm going to chop up some onion i'm

1043
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:38,079
going to do thinly sliced onion i'm

1044
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:40,240
making a potato salad

1045
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:42,860
but it's with leafy greens this potato

1046
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:49,040
salad isn't with mayo

1047
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:52,720
[Music]

1048
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:52,720
just cutting up some onion nice and thin

1049
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:02,550
[Music]

1050
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:05,920
so

1051
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:08,160
i'm not going to cut these pieces up

1052
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:09,440
real small so i don't want to do that so

1053
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,920
i'm going to put a few on here i'm going

1054
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:13,920
to put a few on later too

1055
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:16,839
i want i want the onion pieces kind of a

1056
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:18,079
little bigger even though they're sliced

1057
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:19,839
then

1058
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:21,359
you know everybody's on blood thinners

1059
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:22,960
because the high fat diets by the way

1060
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:24,560
their adrenals get burnt out it can't

1061
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:33,599
thin out their blood anymore

1062
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:34,560
cardiovascular problems

1063
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:37,119
i think i'm going to cut up some

1064
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,119
potatoes

1065
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,320
these are these are gold potatoes look

1066
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,480
at those

1067
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:48,400
cheryl says is that is that why they ask

1068
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:50,400
if you're allergic to eggs

1069
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:53,280
before they give you a flu shot and

1070
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,280
never understood that

1071
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,720
eggs are in all pharmaceuticals just

1072
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:01,680
just a 4-1-1

1073
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:02,079
on that just a wake-up call eggs are in

1074
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:04,880
all

1075
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:04,880
pharmaceuticals

1076
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:12,000
chopping up some potato here

1077
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:15,040
eyes are watering from the onion

1078
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:17,440
that red onion was strong wow that one

1079
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,440
got me

1080
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:29,440
eggs are in all pharmaceuticals

1081
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:31,359
the silver toxic heavy metals

1082
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,800
eggs will feed every single bug every

1083
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:35,440
single pathogen you're worried about

1084
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,440
candida

1085
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:39,280
you're worried about sibo

1086
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:43,119
you're worried about what are you

1087
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,480
worried about nothing you don't think

1088
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:45,200
bugs do anything you don't think you

1089
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,480
have any bugs

1090
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,800
you just think your body's attacking

1091
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:50,240
itself for its jeans

1092
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:57,839
well i mean i just got to give you the

1093
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:57,839
4-1-1 on that one too it's bugs

1094
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:03,440
so i'm cutting up a few potatoes

1095
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:05,599
throwing it on top gonna put the steamed

1096
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:08,839
veggies in

1097
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:11,839
so egg is a good source of protein and

1098
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:11,839
fat

1099
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:17,520
let me tell you something about what

1100
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:21,040
eggs do when you have endometriosis

1101
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:21,040
pcos and fibroids

1102
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:29,359
eggs grow fibroids

1103
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:34,079
worsen pcos worsen endometriosis

1104
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:34,079
that's what eggs do so

1105
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:41,040
eggs are

1106
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:42,960
an instigator of those conditions if you

1107
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:45,119
have a reproductive system condition or

1108
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:48,079
disease or anything like that

1109
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:48,400
eggs will worsen it the worst thing you

1110
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:52,640
can

1111
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:56,240
ever do is eat eggs with pcos

1112
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:56,240
the worst thing you could ever do

1113
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:02,800
but yet you know no one no one knows why

1114
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,079
you get pcos

1115
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:06,079
they don't know what causes it they

1116
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:07,280
think it's genes no one knows why you're

1117
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:08,400
sick with any conditions or

1118
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:10,079
endometriosis or any kind of

1119
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,560
reproductive system condition nobody

1120
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:12,000
knows

1121
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:13,920
but they'll tell you what to eat and

1122
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:17,839
that's how you eat lots of eggs

1123
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:17,839
no science behind it whatsoever

1124
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:23,520
got a tomato right here everyone's on

1125
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:27,040
eggs

1126
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:28,960
everyone is on eggs even vegans are on

1127
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:32,160
eggs

1128
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:34,000
right that's why vegans don't rip apart

1129
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:37,280
eggs you know why

1130
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:39,040
because they go back to them later on

1131
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,319
the minute they get sick or something

1132
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:42,480
goes wrong or they're like

1133
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:44,079
wait a minute i'm getting sick and i'm a

1134
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:47,200
vegan

1135
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:48,000
they run back to eggs they start to

1136
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,599
doubt themselves

1137
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,960
they start to doubt why they're vegan if

1138
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:52,560
you're vegan stay vegan if your

1139
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:54,000
plant-based stay plant-based

1140
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:56,000
if you're animal protein stay animal

1141
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,640
protein if you want but just

1142
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,400
stay off of eggs throw in some tomatoes

1143
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:05,119
on here

1144
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:06,880
everyone's sick everyone's getting sick

1145
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:08,960
don't get fooled when you see young

1146
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:12,400
people that

1147
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:14,079
that escaped sickness early on

1148
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:16,079
don't really have anything going on but

1149
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:17,599
they get a cold they get a uti once in a

1150
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:20,640
while they get some acne

1151
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:22,160
don't get tricked because they're just

1152
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:24,079
going to get sick when they're 40 years

1153
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:26,480
old just like everybody else is now or

1154
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:29,440
38 or 35

1155
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:31,280
they're just gonna get sick and

1156
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:33,440
everybody's eating eggs but it's not

1157
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,960
questioned it's never questioned isn't

1158
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:36,400
that funny everybody's on caffeine

1159
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,040
everybody's eating eggs that's the two

1160
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,440
food groups

1161
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:41,440
two number one food groups caffeine and

1162
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:43,680
eggs but it's never questioned

1163
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:44,960
meanwhile everybody's getting sick but

1164
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:47,760
those aren't questioned ever

1165
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:49,440
they're not even looked at as an issue

1166
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:51,040
but yet it's the number one

1167
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,480
food group and if we're always going to

1168
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:54,880
walk around saying

1169
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:56,880
food makes us sick food is thy medicine

1170
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:57,440
food is what keeps us going food's what

1171
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:00,560
protects

1172
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:03,359
us food is what you eat is what you are

1173
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:05,119
whatever you want to do realize then if

1174
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:06,960
this is the number one food group which

1175
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:07,920
is eggs and caffeine and we're all sick

1176
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,720
on the planet

1177
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:13,839
huh no one's looking at the number one

1178
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:13,839
food everybody's eating

1179
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:18,319
these tomatoes look really good

1180
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:26,240
i'm gonna cut up some more tomatoes put

00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:31,839
put some

1183
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:33,680
putting some onion on here so listen to

1184
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:34,960
medical medium podcasts at apple podcast

1185
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:36,160
have you guys been listening to my

1186
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:39,280
podcast

1187
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:41,200
medical medium podcast at apple podcast

1188
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:42,800
i have an egg episode with a lot of a

1189
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:44,560
lot of questions you know answered on

1190
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:46,480
that

1191
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:49,520
i'm going to put some of these in here

1192
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:52,240
some of these steamed vegetables

1193
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:54,000
i steamed them up in the pan got some

1194
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:57,280
asparagus

1195
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,280
cauliflower right here you guys

1196
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:10,000
science is so smart right

1197
00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:12,400
that they want you to be on lots of meat

1198
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,160
if you're anemic right

1199
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,839
that's kind of always perplexed me it's

1200
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:17,520
a head scratcher for me

1201
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:19,200
because everybody who's anemic they're

1202
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:21,839
on meat

1203
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:24,000
so you i can't tell you how many times

1204
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:25,520
i've talked to people who are anemic

1205
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,200
and they said the doctor wants me to be

1206
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:28,560
on meat i said well what's your diet and

1207
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:31,040
they said well i eat meat

1208
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:31,839
i go you you've always eat you've always

1209
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:34,640
eaten meat

1210
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:36,000
like yeah i've always eaten meat then

1211
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:37,200
how does that work your doctor tells you

1212
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,319
to eat meat because you're anemic but

1213
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,800
you've already been eating meat your

1214
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:40,800
whole life

1215
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:47,280
do you guys see the irony in any of that

1216
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:54,160
cause of anemia is toxic heavy metals

1217
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:56,160
plus viruses low-grade viral infections

1218
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:59,359
such as epstein-barr

1219
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:02,079
that's the anemia virus

1220
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:04,079
and they feed on iron there's certain

1221
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:06,319
varieties of epstein-barr

1222
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:07,839
certain mutations that love to feed on

1223
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:11,040
iron and that's where we get the

1224
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:11,040
the mystery anemia

1225
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:18,720
aretha says i thought tomatoes

1226
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:22,079
are inflammatory

1227
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:23,680
they're not inflammatory that's a that's

1228
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:27,359
a myth

1229
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:29,520
absolutely but pizza the tomatoes are

1230
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:32,160
really inflammatory on pizza because

1231
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:32,880
your pizza is going to have cheese it's

1232
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:35,280
going to have

1233
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:37,280
which is really highly inflammatory it's

1234
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:39,280
going to have gluten in the crust

1235
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:40,800
which is highly inflammatory it's going

1236
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:44,160
to have lots of oil in there

1237
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:45,040
lots of salt salt on a high levels

1238
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:47,200
inflammatory

1239
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:48,240
meaning salt that's added in like sea

1240
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:51,680
salts and

1241
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:55,040
rock salts but or

1242
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:56,240
pasta with tomato sauce on it right

1243
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:57,920
it's not the tomatoes that's

1244
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,640
inflammatory it's the gluten in the

1245
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:01,079
pasta

1246
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:02,800
it's the cheese it's the parmesan cheese

1247
00:46:01,079 --> 00:46:03,119
parmigiano-reggiano it's all that on

1248
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:05,920
there

1249
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:06,720
gianno it's that's what makes it a

1250
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:10,319
problem

1251
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:11,280
tomatoes are anti-viral tomatoes are

1252
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:15,119
healing

1253
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:16,640
there's vitamin c in tomatoes so

1254
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:19,920
these are actually this is actually a

1255
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:22,079
healing food we need a fresh tomato

1256
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:24,800
not a green tomato it's got to be a nice

1257
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:27,520
ripe red tomato look at these tomatoes

1258
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:28,800
is that is that incredible right these

1259
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:31,200
are antiviral

1260
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:32,400
antibacterial see i love foods that are

1261
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:34,160
antiviral

1262
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,599
because when you eat the asparagus

1263
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:38,079
that's antiviral

1264
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:40,319
okay the asparagus right there antiviral

1265
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:42,079
cauliflower the sulfur in cauliflower

1266
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:44,240
which is what we're partially made out

1267
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:46,240
of is antiviral right

1268
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:48,319
you got all the different greens in here

1269
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:51,599
antiviral

1270
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:54,319
so anti epstein-barr anti-shingles

1271
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:56,480
anti-you know neurotoxins

1272
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:58,160
so the reason why people get inflamed is

1273
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,760
they'll have low-grade epstein-barr if

1274
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:01,119
you want to learn about this you want to

1275

00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:11,359
sage going on top

1304
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:21,839
put a little bit more onion on here what

1305
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:21,839
i'm going to do

1306
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:25,320
[Music]

1307
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:28,880
slicing it kind of thin

1308
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:36,079
so talk about vinegar for a little bit

1309
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:40,079
too so let's go into a few different

1310
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:40,079
things well i got you guys here

[Music]

1312

by the way there's an r.a protocol in

1313
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:53,839
the book rheumatoid

here

1317
00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:03,599
michelle's asking what else you got

1318
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:05,599
i don't know if that's to the meals or

1319
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:07,200
something else

1320
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:09,119
putting a little extra onion on here i

1321
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:11,280
put some sage on there

1322
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:12,640
put a little bit more onion on top i'm

1323
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:14,319
going to put a little bit more tomato on

1324
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:15,119
top of the salad too so i still need

1325
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:16,880
more

1326
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:20,319
of that might garnish it with a little

1327
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:20,319
bit more parsley too

1328
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:26,240
what you'll know about these meals that

1329
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,920
i'm making you guys

1330
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:30,000
i'm trying to offer healing healing

1331
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:31,680
meals that aren't loaded with fat on top

1332
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,760
of it to get your insulin you know

1333
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:35,359
resistance off the charts because that's

1334
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:37,359
what the fats will do when you pound on

1335
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:40,480
the oils on top of this and

1336
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:42,839
get your you get insulin resistance and

1337
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:44,079
i don't want you to get insulin

1338
00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:47,440
resistant

1339
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:47,440
these are fat free meals

1340
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:51,920
helps to protect your pancreas your

1341
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:51,920
liver

1342
00:49:53,680 --> 00:50:01,280
your pancreas your liver your adrenals

1343
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:02,960
these are meals without vinegar meals

1344
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:05,599
without pounding the salt

1345
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:06,640
meals without pounding the oil i'm

1346
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:09,839
trying to give you

1347
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:15,200
nutritional yeast vinegar

1348
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:15,200
salt fat free meals

1349
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:19,040
so vinegar pickles are the inside of

1350
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:21,760
your organs

1351
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:22,240
dehydrates you dehydrates it sucks the

1352
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:24,800
water

1353
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:26,400
out of every cell in your body so that's

1354
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:28,559
what vinegar does

1355
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:30,079
every time you eat vinegar you're

1356
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:32,480
pickling yourself

1357
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:34,079
just like pickles in a jar and when you

1358
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:37,839
add vinegar and salt together

1359
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:39,920
you pickle yourself even more okay and

1360
00:50:37,839 --> 00:50:41,599
you don't want to be a fermented food

1361
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:44,480
like you don't want to be

1362
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:44,960
a fermented food you know that's not the

1363
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:46,559
goal

1364
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:48,480
that's not what your body wants it

1365
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:50,800
doesn't want you to ferment it it

1366
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:51,440
doesn't want you to suck the life out of

1367
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:53,920
it

1368
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:55,599
your body is always subjected to all of

1369
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:57,839
our idiotic ideas

1370
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:59,680
here on earth that's what it's subjected

1371
00:50:57,839 --> 00:51:01,760
to it's subjected to

1372
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:02,880
caffeine it's subjected to eggs it's

1373
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:04,559
subjected to

1374
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:06,000
because now eggs are are not good

1375
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:06,400
anymore because what i told you guys

1376
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,760
about

1377
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:09,680
what they did to them they ruined them

1378
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:11,440
on you it subjected like

1379
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:13,280
to the nutritional yeast subject it to

1380
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:14,079
the vinegars like i said subjected to

1381
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:17,200
all the salt

1382
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:19,119
subjected to all the oils

1383
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:21,359
fermented foods was a survival food

1384
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:23,920
because in the country

1385
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:25,040
you took your garden vegetables

1386
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:27,200
everything you had

1387
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:29,200
left and you took them and you stuck

1388
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:32,319
them in a big container

1389
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:35,359
and you fermented them so

1390
00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:37,040
that you can stay alive when winter came

1391
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:38,400
because you had no electricity you

1392
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:39,280
couldn't you couldn't have you didn't

1393
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,280
have a freezer

1394
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:43,040
to freeze your food you didn't have a

1395
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,760
refrigerator to keep your food you know

1396
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:45,760
fresh

1397
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:47,920
plus you didn't have options to get more

1398
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:50,800
food coming in more food coming in

1399
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:51,520
it was a survival tactic around the

1400
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:55,680
world

1401
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:58,800
okay because when winter was approaching

1402
00:51:55,680 --> 00:52:00,000
your garden was picked it was done you

1403
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:02,400
get one last term

1404
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,480
you know turn up you get a few more

1405
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:05,520
greens or onions or whatever you get out

1406
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:07,440
of your garden

1407
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:09,280
and then it's done for the year you take

1408
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:10,800
everything you had cabbages whatever it

1409
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:13,839
is and you shove it into that

1410
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:16,960
and you ferment it to make it last

1411
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:18,640
longer for survival it was just a

1412
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:20,640
survival tactic

1413
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:22,720
it didn't mean it was the answer see the

1414
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:23,280
world has changed you have fresh produce

1415
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:25,680
now

1416
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:27,440
you don't have to go back to that you

1417
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:28,079
got fresh produce you could take care of

1418
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:30,079
yourself

1419
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:31,680
you got fresh priest you know pea

1420
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:35,040
sprouts fresh

1421
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:38,319
parsley spinach

1422
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:41,040
you don't want dead decaying food

1423
00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:42,800
and that's what happens fermented foods

1424
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:44,480
not like when you cook something down or

1425
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:46,319
steam it or you have all these raw

1426
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:50,240
vegetables fermented food

1427
00:52:46,319 --> 00:52:53,520
is dead it died it lost its

1428
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:57,040
life and the bacteria on

1429
00:52:53,520 --> 00:53:00,800
fermented food is death borne

1430
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:04,160
bacteria that's what that is it's not

1431
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:05,680
living bacteria when you pluck parsley

1432
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:07,760
out of your garden

1433
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:08,880
it's got microorganisms on it that's

1434
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:12,559
alive

1435
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:15,680
that's living because the plant's living

1436
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:18,720
when you take this and you ferment it

1437
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:21,680
and it dies now the bacteria

1438
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:23,440
is for death it's like when an animal

1439
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:26,640
dies in the woods

1440
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:31,359
it gets overcome by bacteria

1441
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:34,720
that's death feeding bacteria

1442
00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:36,160
that's why you know when we die we get

1443
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:39,520
overcome

1444
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:44,079
by bacteria really fast that's why they

1445
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:46,880
embalm us to stop us from breaking down

1446
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:48,960
when vegetables and plant life die it

1447
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:50,640
gets engulfed by bacteria

1448
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:53,839
but we're not supposed to be eating

1449
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:55,599
death ridden bacteria

1450
00:53:53,839 --> 00:53:58,000
we're supposed to be eating

1451
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:59,440
microorganisms that are on your spinach

1452
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,680
leaves in the garden

1453
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:03,280
that are on this orange on the surface

1454
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:04,240
if you grate a little bit of the orange

1455
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:07,359
peel

1456
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:08,400
um you know on the sage in your garden

1457
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:11,440
right here

1458
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:13,680
fresh fresh picked asparagus

1459
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:16,319
that's the bacteria that we're supposed

1460
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:16,319
to consume

1461
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:20,960
rose says well i guess you are the

1462
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:23,119
authority then

1463
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:24,079
peace out glad eating more vegetables

1464
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:26,800
and removing animal

1465
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:27,599
fats helps people nothing new here

1466
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:29,520
that's

1467
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:30,720
a head scratcher for me rose to be

1468
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:34,160
honest with you

1469
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:35,760
because uh the whole high fat

1470
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:37,200
movement going on that's been going on

1471
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:40,720
forever well

1472
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:44,160
medical medium information 35 years ago

1473
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:45,040
put the pin in that bubble about fat

1474
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:47,760
being bad

1475
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:50,160
so that's 35 plus years of work for

1476
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:53,760
medical medium to teach people low fat

1477
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:56,000
so interesting because guess what

1478
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:58,000
it was a small health movement back then

1479
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,640
and i talked to everybody i lectured

1480
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,359
about it

1481
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:01,920
i wrote about it you name it and the

1482
00:55:01,359 --> 00:55:04,400
circuit

1483
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:06,319
back then 35 years ago knows who i was

1484
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:10,000
and knows who i am till this day

1485
00:55:06,319 --> 00:55:11,040
and knows why avoid fats is out there to

1486
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,640
the extent it is

1487
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:14,559
even though it's not really out there

1488
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:16,640
because everybody's pounding the fats 24

1489
00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:17,359
7 and the keto diet is basically out

1490
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:19,520
there

1491
00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:21,359
you know doing that whole thing with

1492
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:23,839
fats and all that another thing too is i

1493
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:26,640
don't say get off of animal protein

1494
00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:28,319
that's another thing too so it's like

1495
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:29,920
removing animal fats well

1496
00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:31,920
first of all if you want to eat chicken

1497
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:34,799
you can eat chicken but you can still

1498
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:36,160
heal if you want to eat animal protein

1499
00:55:34,799 --> 00:55:39,280
you could eat animal protein

1500
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:41,280
but you can still heal you can i've been

1501
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:43,280
talking about you got to lower it

1502
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:44,880
and know when to lower it when to eat

1503
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:47,040
your animal protein

1504
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:48,079
how to get your morning cleanse in the

1505
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:49,520
morning so you're not doing

1506
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:51,599
fats in the morning that's medical

1507
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:52,480
medium information not doing fats in the

1508
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:55,520
morning

1509
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:57,520
so all that's important too um there's

1510
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:59,040
so much detail in it it's not just as

1511
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:59,839
simple as eat some fruits and vegetables

1512
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:02,160
and you're good

1513
00:55:59,839 --> 00:56:04,319
what about all the wild foods that are

1514
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:04,960
in the mm protocols what about the wild

1515
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:06,640
foods

1516
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:08,559
what about the no vinegar with no

1517
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:10,319
nutritional yeast oh that's out there

1518
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:12,319
um sorry but i'm the one who put that

1519
00:56:10,319 --> 00:56:14,480
out there about no nutritional yeast

1520
00:56:12,319 --> 00:56:16,799
no vinegars and all that other stuff too

1521
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:18,079
and then the true cause is a sickness so

1522
00:56:16,799 --> 00:56:20,000
if you're not learning about the true

1523
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:21,520
cause over here about the fact that ebv

1524
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,280
causes fibromyalgia because

1525
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:24,640
that's published material for medical

1526
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:26,640
medium or

1527
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:29,359
shingles causes trigeminal algae which

1528
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:30,720
is published material for medical medium

1529
00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:33,119
it's important to know all these little

1530
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:34,000
details i love when someone tries to

1531
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:36,880
round it off

1532
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:38,000
and say hey you know sure nothing new

1533
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:40,319
here some fruits and

1534
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,440
vegetables and get rid of animal protein

1535
00:56:40,319 --> 00:56:43,680
i mean

1536
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:44,960
that's all great then if that's the

1537
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:46,160
answer and it's nothing new then why is

1538
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:47,920
everybody sick

1539
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:49,440
and why is everybody sicker than ever

1540
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:50,640
before and why is everybody in the

1541
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:52,240
health movement getting sick

1542
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:54,559
and running for their lives to the other

1543
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:56,400
side animal protein people running to

1544
00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:58,000
their lives to the vegan side vegan

1545
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:59,839
people running to their lives for their

1546
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,280
lives in the animal protein side because

1547
00:56:59,839 --> 00:57:03,040
they're all still sick having problems

1548
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:04,559
oh my acne is back again i thought my

1549
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:06,160
vegan diet would fix it

1550
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:07,680
whoa wait a minute i was eating fruits

1551
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:09,839
and vegetables oh wait

1552
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:11,680
uh wait my uti's are back i thought my

1553
00:57:09,839 --> 00:57:13,359
animal protein keto diet would fix it

1554
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:15,200
i'm back on vegan everybody's running

1555
00:57:13,359 --> 00:57:17,200
back and forth

1556
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:18,799
and because nobody knew it was pathogens

1557
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:19,920
so medical medium information is the

1558
00:57:18,799 --> 00:57:22,480
first time ever

1559
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:23,760
we got answers and more people and more

1560
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:25,760
healing stories than ever before in

1561
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:27,599
history from mm info so yeah

1562
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:29,280
you want to just you want to throw

1563
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:30,319
everything out of context not look at

1564
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:32,559
the details

1565
00:57:30,319 --> 00:57:34,559
say hey nothing new to figure out here

1566
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:36,400
good be on your merry way i'm glad

1567
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:38,000
but i'll tell you when you get real sick

1568
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:40,559
down the road and

1569
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:42,160
you can't get better no matter what

1570
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:43,839
vegetable you're trying or whatever

1571
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:45,760
somebody's telling you to do or whatever

1572
00:57:43,839 --> 00:57:47,680
collagen someone tell you to take

1573
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:48,960
whether animal protein or not when you

1574
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:50,640
can't get better down the road

1575
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:52,480
and you're 40 years old or whatever

1576
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:54,720
you're 42 years old and now you're sick

1577
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:56,240
and you saw your 10th neurologist

1578
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:57,760
remember medical medium information

1579
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:59,200
because it saved a tremendous amount of

1580
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:02,720
lives around the world

1581
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:03,839
right here revised and expanded

1582
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:06,720
but i'm glad you're here though i hope

1583
00:58:03,839 --> 00:58:09,040
you stay on um

1584
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:10,280
annette so fermented veggies are dead

1585
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:13,839
but cooked or not

1586
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:17,599
correct i'm so confused

1587
00:58:13,839 --> 00:58:20,480
correct okay so

1588
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:21,440
cooked is the state we put them in so

1589
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:24,480
that's the state

1590
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:30,480
we put the food in okay

1591
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:34,400
so when a vegetable is alive

1592
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:37,599
and dies and decays

1593
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:40,720
a natural death okay

1594
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:44,960
that's a different situation

1595
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:48,000
we don't take you have to understand

1596
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:48,640
when we eat animal meat you kill the

1597
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:53,200
animal

1598
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:56,960
right so people do they kill the animal

1599
00:58:53,200 --> 00:59:00,799
okay and that's forcing

1600
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:04,799
that to die you see

1601
00:59:00,799 --> 00:59:06,880
we forced the food to die in the moment

1602
00:59:04,799 --> 00:59:08,079
people kill animals to eat animal

1603
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:11,280
protein they force

1604
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:13,599
the death on the animal right it's not

1605
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:15,920
an animal dead in the woods that died

1606
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:16,720
no one will touch the meat the meat's

1607
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:19,040
gone bad

1608
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:19,920
now the raccoons and the coyotes are

1609
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:22,480
coming

1610
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:24,960
you see the difference so if an animal

1611
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:27,839
dies naturally in the woods

1612
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:28,480
and it just falls to the ground right a

1613
00:59:27,839 --> 00:59:31,599
bear

1614
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:32,480
a deer whatever kind of animal or a cow

1615
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:34,720
in a field

1616
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:35,920
just dies and falls over and it's

1617
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:39,440
sitting out there

1618
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:40,799
and it's starting to decay it passes a

1619
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:42,480
deadline

1620
00:59:40,799 --> 00:59:44,079
there's a difference there you're not

1621
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:45,520
going to go out there be like that cow's

1622
00:59:44,079 --> 00:59:48,079
been dead for like

1623
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:50,240
two days i'm gonna go cut up a piece of

1624
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:50,960
meat you're gonna be scared to death of

1625
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:54,000
that cow

1626
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:54,720
scared the death of that meat but when

1627
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:59,440
they

1628
00:59:54,720 --> 01:00:01,839
fresh kill and preserve the food

1629
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:04,319
it's a different story when you have

1630
01:00:01,839 --> 01:00:07,839
fresh produce and yes you steam it

1631
01:00:04,319 --> 01:00:08,880
it's it's a variety of killing it but

1632
01:00:07,839 --> 01:00:11,440
not the same

1633
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:14,079
thing what happens is there's not going

1634
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:16,240
to be any of that death bacteria growing

1635
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:18,160
in this steamed cooked food right now so

1636
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:18,960
when you steam a cauliflower you steam

1637
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:21,119
asparagus

1638
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:22,079
there's no bacteria that's going to want

1639
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:24,400
to surface

1640
01:00:22,079 --> 01:00:26,240
and start to devour it through a natural

1641
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:27,119
process that we're not supposed to be

1642
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:28,799
involved with

1643
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:31,839
we're not supposed to be eating death

1644
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:35,520
bacteria there's none of that here

1645
01:00:31,839 --> 01:00:37,200
we forced this to cook bacteria is not

1646
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:39,920
going to overcome it

1647
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:40,480
and it's freshly cooked that's the whole

1648
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:43,359
point

1649
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:44,799
it's not like decaying fruits and

1650
01:00:43,359 --> 01:00:47,280
vegetables

1651
01:00:44,799 --> 01:00:49,440
or decaying vegetables really and then

1652
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:52,640
it's sitting in vats while the death

1653
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:55,040
while the grim reaper the grim reaper's

1654
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:57,839
bacteria comes and overtakes it the

1655
01:00:55,040 --> 01:01:00,960
stuff we're not supposed to really eat

1656
01:00:57,839 --> 01:01:02,480
and um that's how it works

1657
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:04,079
the bacteria that's inside your small

1658
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:05,599
intestinal tract your duodenum small

1659
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:07,359
intestinal tract and colon is not the

1660
01:01:05,599 --> 01:01:09,280
bacteria that's on fermented food by the

1661
01:01:07,359 --> 01:01:10,799
way i'm just giving you a 4-1-1 on that

1662
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:13,520
that's not what it is

1663
01:01:10,799 --> 01:01:14,160
the bacteria that you want inside your

1664
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:16,559
colon

1665
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:18,000
an intestinal tract okay your duodenum

1666
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:20,480
small intestinal tract and colon

1667
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:21,839
is the bacteria that's on something you

1668
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:24,079
picked out of the garden that has

1669
01:01:21,839 --> 01:01:25,839
elevated biotics on it that's actually

1670
01:01:24,079 --> 01:01:27,839
living on the leaf so that when you eat

1671
01:01:25,839 --> 01:01:30,640
the parsley in that moment

1672
01:01:27,839 --> 01:01:32,480
you're getting that elevated biotic

1673
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:34,319
that's where you get the microorganisms

1674
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:37,440
and it goes down into your helium then

1675
01:01:34,319 --> 01:01:40,880
it sits down in there and it creates b12

1676
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:44,160
now if you ferment this parsley

1677
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:47,359
and ferment it and that

1678
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:50,079
grim reaper's death bacteria okay

1679
01:01:47,359 --> 01:01:51,680
is in there with it that doesn't go down

1680
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:52,000
to your helium it doesn't even make it

1681
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:54,480
down

1682
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,280
there it gets killed off by your hcl in

1683
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:56,720
your stomach

1684
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:58,960
it's not the bacteria that actually

1685
01:01:56,720 --> 01:02:02,640
produces b12 and it's not the beneficial

1686
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:02,640
bacteria that actually gives you life

1687
01:02:02,799 --> 01:02:10,160
so it's important to know all right

1688
01:02:06,319 --> 01:02:11,200
put another potato on top of here

1689
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:15,039
actually you know what i'm going to put

1690
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:15,039
just finish this tomato right here

1691
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:19,839
now you can do vinegar that's not that

1692
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:20,480
doesn't have the bacteria and you can do

1693
01:02:19,839 --> 01:02:23,680
acv

1694
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:25,200
that has bacteria mother right

1695
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:27,359
well that mother never passes your

1696
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:29,280
stomach

1697
01:02:27,359 --> 01:02:31,839
it gets eaten up by your hcl whatever's

1698
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:31,839
left of it

1699
01:02:33,359 --> 01:02:38,640
something now i'm gonna put a little bit

1700
01:02:35,359 --> 01:02:38,640
of this orange squeezed on top

1701
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:46,480
now personally me i would like a nice

1702
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:48,130
fresh juicy orange like that and not a

1703
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:49,520
fermented one

1704
01:02:48,130 --> 01:02:52,720
[Music]

1705
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:52,720
squeeze a little orange on here

1706
01:02:55,839 --> 01:03:03,839
i'm going to put a lemon on here too

1707
01:03:05,839 --> 01:03:10,400
vinegar robs minerals from your teeth

1708
01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:12,799
and bones

1709
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:14,880
more vinegar you do the more you lose

1710
01:03:12,799 --> 01:03:17,920
your teeth later on

1711
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:19,839
vinegar is the teeth dissolver the teeth

1712
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:22,960
destroyer

1713
01:03:19,839 --> 01:03:24,160
that's what it is it robs calcium from

1714
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:27,520
your bones

1715
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:30,799
calcium from your teeth

1716
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:34,000
because when you put

1717
01:03:30,799 --> 01:03:36,240
acetic acid inside of you you need your

1718
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:39,599
body to dig out calcium

1719
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:44,240
so your body has to find calcium because

1720
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:47,680
acetic acid is so acidic it's so bad

1721
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:49,039
that you need your own calcium to try to

1722
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:52,799
neutralize it

1723
01:03:49,039 --> 01:03:54,160
your body pushes out as vinegar sucks

1724
01:03:52,799 --> 01:03:55,920
the life out of you it sucks the

1725
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:56,559
minerals out of you it sucks the calcium

1726
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:59,599
out of you

1727
01:03:56,559 --> 01:04:02,079
your body pushes that calcium out of

1728
01:03:59,599 --> 01:04:04,559
your teeth like here here save my life

1729
01:04:02,079 --> 01:04:05,200
your body tries to save itself by

1730
01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:07,039
emitting

1731
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:08,559
calcium from your bones and teeth when

1732
01:04:07,039 --> 01:04:13,839
you take vinegar i don't care if it's

1733
01:04:08,559 --> 01:04:13,839
acv it's all the same

1734
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:17,839
look there's all kinds of different

1735
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:19,440
spices you can put on a salad

1736
01:04:17,839 --> 01:04:21,119
all right so let me just give you a

1737
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:23,359
quick run down here i got tomatoes i got

1738
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:26,079
onions cauliflower asparagus right

1739
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:27,440
right everything's in here spinach pea

1740
01:04:26,079 --> 01:04:30,480
shoots

1741
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:31,839
and uh parsley um i'm gonna put a little

1742
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:34,400
chili powder on top

1743
01:04:31,839 --> 01:04:34,400
can't help it

1744
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:41,839
vinegar is a like it's a preservative

1745
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:42,400
it's you ha i'm not on a preservative

1746
01:04:41,839 --> 01:04:44,319
diet

1747
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:46,799
i don't do preservatives all my stuff's

1748
01:04:44,319 --> 01:04:49,680
all natural um why are you putting acv

1749
01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:50,319
on your food that's a preservative it is

1750
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:52,839
yeah

1751
01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:54,160
it's a preservative acetic acid is a

1752
01:04:52,839 --> 01:04:56,160
preservative

1753
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:58,559
putting a little chili chili uh pepper

1754
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:58,559
on here

1755
01:05:00,319 --> 01:05:06,319
it's acetic acid

1756
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:07,920
it's a preservative you don't want

1757
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:09,440
preservatives because you end up

1758
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:12,640
pickling your own organs

1759
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:14,799
your liver it goes into like

1760
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:16,880
shock when you dump too much vinegar in

1761
01:05:14,799 --> 01:05:20,000
there because it goes up into the liver

1762
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:23,520
and when it goes up into the liver

1763
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:25,200
you're pickling your liver

1764
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:26,960
you already have salt in your blood

1765
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:29,039
because we have sodium naturally

1766
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:30,480
occurring in the bloodstream

1767
01:05:29,039 --> 01:05:32,240
right i'm not even just talking about

1768
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:33,920
the sodium we're adding and what happens

1769
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:37,440
is when you

1770
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:40,720
put vinegar and sodium together

1771
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:44,319
you're now really preserving your organs

1772
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:44,319
you're pickling your own organs

1773
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:52,400
look i don't have fun telling you guys

1774
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:56,480
all this stuff

1775
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:58,319
all right this is onion powder

1776
01:05:56,480 --> 01:06:00,079
it's got really a great flavor when you

1777
01:05:58,319 --> 01:06:02,799
put it on top of like a potato salad

1778
01:06:00,079 --> 01:06:04,160
with all these vegetables

1779
01:06:02,799 --> 01:06:06,079
there's not much on there i probably did

1780
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:07,680
a teaspoon and a half and a little bit

1781
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:10,160
of ground coriander i'm going to put on

1782
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:10,160
top too

1783
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:19,839
a little bit on top

1784
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:26,480
um so you got to think about that

1785
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:29,039
it's just like a jar of pickles you

1786
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:32,480
stick acetic acid in there

1787
01:06:29,039 --> 01:06:33,520
and you stick salt and now you got your

1788
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:36,640
pickle in the middle

1789
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:38,960
and the life is sucked out of the pickle

1790
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:40,960
which is the cucumber the life is sucked

1791
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:43,760
out of it the more vinegar we do

1792
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:45,599
and the salt we do we're slowly sucking

1793
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:48,240
the life out of our

1794
01:06:45,599 --> 01:06:49,280
we're trying to preserve ourselves we're

1795
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:52,799
preserving ourselves

1796
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:54,319
in a bad way you see how it goes

1797
01:06:52,799 --> 01:07:00,400
and then on top of that all the other

1798
01:06:54,319 --> 01:07:01,760
stuff we do

1799
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:04,319

01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:40,960
right here

1852
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:42,319
here's what you have to understand if

1853
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:44,319
this has nothing to do with animal

1854
01:08:42,319 --> 01:08:45,440
protein me liking animal protein or not

1855
01:08:44,319 --> 01:08:48,000
has nothing to do with this it's

1856
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:50,719
information you have to see it like this

1857
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:52,480
if you're somebody that thinks you're

1858
01:08:50,719 --> 01:08:54,799
getting your b12 from your animal

1859
01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:58,239
protein you're not

1860
01:08:54,799 --> 01:09:02,480
because b12 produced by

1861
01:08:58,239 --> 01:09:07,520
animals isn't the b12 your body utilizes

1862
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:10,560
it's there for the animal our bodies

1863
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:14,960
need a certain type of b12 okay

1864
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:16,199
one either produced by us or one

1865
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:18,080
that's a methylcobalamin

1866
01:09:16,199 --> 01:09:19,679
adenosilcobalamin so that's the vimergy

1867
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:22,799
one that i take every day

1868
01:09:19,679 --> 01:09:25,679
so that's how our bodies work

1869
01:09:22,799 --> 01:09:26,799
so if you're not eating all of the

1870
01:09:25,679 --> 01:09:29,600
garden

1871
01:09:26,799 --> 01:09:30,719
vegetables that have the microorganisms

1872
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:34,080
on top

1873
01:09:30,719 --> 01:09:36,400
to create your own b12 and your ilium

1874
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:37,279
then you need a supplement that's how it

1875
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:39,679
works

1876
01:09:37,279 --> 01:09:41,040
and so like that's the one i recommend

1877
01:09:39,679 --> 01:09:42,719
all the time is the vimers you want i'm

1878
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:44,880
not sponsored

1879
01:09:42,719 --> 01:09:47,279
but if you think you're getting b12 from

1880
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:50,400
your chicken you're not because the b12

1881
01:09:47,279 --> 01:09:53,920
is create that your chicken creates

1882
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:55,840
is b12 for your chicken that was when

1883
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:58,800
your chicken was alive

1884
01:09:55,840 --> 01:10:01,280
it needed the b12 to stay alive that b12

1885
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:02,400
identifies with its own nervous system

1886
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:04,880
and brain

1887
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:07,360
and the same thing with the cow the

1888
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:10,000
cow's b12

1889
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:11,120
is produced for the cow's nervous system

1890
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:14,480
and brain

1891
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:17,120
the b12 we produce is produced

1892
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:19,199
for our nervous system in our brain

1893
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:22,159
right and our organs

1894
01:10:19,199 --> 01:10:22,800
that's how it works with b12 so hey no

1895
01:10:22,159 --> 01:10:24,800
you're getting pl

1896
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:27,040
your vegans don't get b12 well animal

1897
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:29,520
protein people don't get b12 either

1898
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:30,080
plant-based people don't get b12 they

1899
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:33,920
don't

1900
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:37,199
no no one's getting b12

1901
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:40,640
no one is unless you're eating

1902
01:10:37,199 --> 01:10:43,760
enough vegetables greens

1903
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:47,199
out of your garden or picking

1904
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:49,280
fresh berries out of your garden

1905
01:10:47,199 --> 01:10:51,199
and there's the microorganisms on top of

1906
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:53,120
there that microorganism goes down to

1907
01:10:51,199 --> 01:10:54,480
your helium and creates your b12 right

1908
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:55,920
but people lack this

1909
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:57,360
and they don't have enough of those

1910
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:58,239
fresh picked vegetables with

1911
01:10:57,360 --> 01:11:02,080
microorganisms

1912
01:10:58,239 --> 01:11:04,880
on it and so plant-based people

1913
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:07,520
animal protein people vegetarians

1914
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:09,440
they're not getting b12

1915
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:10,960
so in order to heal and heal

1916
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:12,640

01:12:12,239 --> 01:12:15,840
they test okay for their b12 that

1951
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:17,600
doesn't test

1952
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:19,840
how much b12 is in their brain and

1953
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:21,679
nervous system you can't measure that

1954
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:23,760
there's no blood test that can test how

1955
01:12:21,679 --> 01:12:26,480
much is in the brain and nervous system

1956
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:28,239
or in the liver you don't know so you

1957
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:29,920
have to keep the b12 going i teach

1958
01:12:28,239 --> 01:12:31,920

we've

1975
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:03,679
stinging in our life people letting us

1976
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:05,760
down

1977
01:13:03,679 --> 01:13:07,120
right being let down whatever it is

1978
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:08,480
happening or if you're just struggling

1979
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:10,480
with a chronic illness

1980
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:12,400
the moon meditation take advantage of it

1981
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:13,440
have you guys done it i know many of you

1982
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:16,880
guys have

1983
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:19,120
yep yes love the moon meditation

1984
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:21,120
um carol says he has incorrect

1985
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:24,080
information about b12 b12

1986
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:25,120
is bioavailable from meat it's funny

1987
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:26,239
because there's no science that

1988
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:29,120
determines that

1989
01:13:26,239 --> 01:13:29,920
so i guess you're just making it up

1990
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:33,199
because

1991
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:35,280
i have a source so carol i actually have

1992
01:13:33,199 --> 01:13:36,719
a source of information that's already

1993
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:37,760
proven to track record and healed

1994
01:13:36,719 --> 01:13:40,239
millions around the world

1995
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:41,600
okay so that's already there i don't

1996
01:13:40,239 --> 01:13:43,600
have anything to prove

1997
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:44,880
but science has a lot to prove because

1998
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:46,719
they haven't proven that

1999
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:48,000
there's no science study that says it's

2000
01:13:46,719 --> 01:13:49,440
bioavailable for meat

2001
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:51,679
they haven't even determined that they

2002
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:54,320
can't even measure that so

2003
01:13:51,679 --> 01:13:55,120
science has let you down okay but

2004
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:58,239
apparently

2005
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:59,199
the information to get people to d the

2006
01:13:58,239 --> 01:14:01,360
tools they need

2007
01:13:59,199 --> 01:14:02,960
from my source hasn't let people down

2008
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:03,679
and millions of heli are healing because

2009
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:05,600
of it

2010
01:14:03,679 --> 01:14:07,280
and bodies are still a mystery to

2011
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:09,360
science why people are sick so

2012
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:10,320
okay science knows that they believe

2013
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:12,560
that they do

2014
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:14,480
well 250 million americans are sick with

2015
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:16,159
conditions and symptoms

2016
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:17,520
billions around the planet are sick with

2017
01:14:16,159 --> 01:14:19,760
symptoms and conditions

2018
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:21,440
but they know all of a sudden that meat

2019
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:22,960
is bioavailable they can't even measure

2020
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:24,400
that they can't even test that

2021
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:27,120
think about it it's not even testable

2022
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:29,199
there's no study that actually shows

2023
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:30,159
that they can actually determine if it's

2024
01:14:29,199 --> 01:14:33,199
bioavailable

2025
01:14:30,159 --> 01:14:34,560
that doesn't exist so i get it throw

2026
01:14:33,199 --> 01:14:37,760
stuff out there if you need to

2027
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:39,840
totally get it but you know it

2028
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:41,440
your information is wrong that's all

2029
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:43,520
your information's incorrect

2030
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:44,480
but you know what the street cred is

2031
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:46,719
here

2032
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:48,480
millions have healed raging eczema

2033
01:14:46,719 --> 01:14:49,520
psoriasis disorders

2034
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:51,440
all kinds of different conditions

2035
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:53,679
anxiety disorders gut problems you name

2036
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:56,000
it have healed when nothing else could

2037
01:14:53,679 --> 01:14:56,880
that right there is already a proven

2038
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:59,199
track record

2039
01:14:56,880 --> 01:15:00,320
and that information came from my source

2040
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:03,520
and my source

2041
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:04,880
says okay instead of science says my

2042
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:07,840
source says

2043
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:08,480
that the b12 produced by an animal is

2044
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:12,960
made

2045
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:14,480
for the animal that animal had no

2046
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:17,040
understanding that it was going to be

2047
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:19,679
used for people to eat

2048
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:21,360
animals the animal's body wasn't

2049
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:22,960
designed or made

2050
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:25,280
to determine it was going to be eaten

2051
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:28,000
someday that's not what happened

2052
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:29,440
so the animals b12 is for the animal's

2053
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:32,000
nervous system to survive

2054
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:32,960
it's not for a human's nervous system it

2055
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:35,520
does not code

2056
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:36,159
over to a human to a human's nervous

2057
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:37,760
system

2058
01:15:36,159 --> 01:15:39,520
your b12 that's produced in your

2059
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:41,440
intestinal tract

2060
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:42,800
is the is the b12 that's for your

2061
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:46,000
nervous system

2062
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:47,679
