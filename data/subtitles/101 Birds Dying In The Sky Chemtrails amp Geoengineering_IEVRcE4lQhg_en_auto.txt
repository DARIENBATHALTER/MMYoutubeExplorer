[1.28 - 7.76] How many people do you know who struggle
[4.32 - 10.24] with their health? Chances are, whether
[7.76 - 14.56] they show it or not, most of the people
[10.24 - 17.64] in your life do. And chances are, you're
[14.56 - 20.80] one of them. Whether you're dealing with
[17.64 - 25.04] anxiety, depression, endometriosis,
[20.80 - 28.00] acne, eczema, autoimmune, thyroid, lime,
[25.04 - 31.32] brain fog, fatigue, or any other symptom
[28.00 - 34.48] or condition, you're far from
[31.32 - 37.76] alone. Living with symptoms has become
[34.48 - 41.44] the new normal. So, no more guessing
[37.76 - 43.84] games. It's time to get answers. Welcome
[41.44 - 46.36] to the Medical Medium Podcast. I'm
[43.84 - 49.44] Anthony William. We're talking about
[46.36 - 52.48] birds. Birds falling from the sky
[49.44 - 54.88] because of chemtrails and geoengineering
[52.48 - 57.36] trails. And we're not just talking about
[54.88 - 60.24] a few birds. We're talking about
[57.36 - 62.92] millions of birds, hundreds of millions
[60.24 - 65.60] over the course of the last 50, 60, 70
[62.92 - 67.68] years. Especially now, there's more
[65.60 - 69.92] chemtrail planes and geoengineering
[67.68 - 72.32] planes in the sky than ever before in
[69.92 - 74.72] history. and they're spewing out and
[72.32 - 77.00] dropping out and injecting so many
[74.72 - 80.48] chemicals and toxic waste into the
[77.00 - 84.00] atmosphere into our skies that birds are
[80.48 - 86.64] losing ground. It's truly a war, a war
[84.00 - 89.04] on our birds. And maybe you're somebody
[86.64 - 91.44] that has seen this or witnessed this.
[89.04 - 94.00] Maybe you're somebody somewhere on this
[91.44 - 96.48] planet that walked down a street or a
[94.00 - 99.76] trail in the woods and saw hundreds of
[96.48 - 102.40] birds laying around or flopping around
[99.76 - 105.28] as they were dying. This has been seen
[102.40 - 107.84] by many people around the world. We're
[105.28 - 110.72] covering how it all happens, how it all
[107.84 - 113.60] goes down, how the chemtrails and the
[110.72 - 115.76] geoengineering trails are destructive on
[113.60 - 118.48] our birds. Get ready for this one.
[115.76 - 120.68] Fasten your seat belt. Strap yourself in
[118.48 - 124.00] because this episode is not for the
[120.68 - 126.81] faint-hearted. We're taking another
[124.00 - 129.96] plane flight.
[126.81 - 129.96] [Music]
[146.20 - 151.76] Chemtrails are the number one bird
[148.80 - 154.40] killer long term. Now, of course, a
[151.76 - 156.88] contender is the bird flu, and that is
[154.40 - 161.20] killing a lot of birds right now. But
[156.88 - 163.60] over the last 50, 60 years, chemtrails
[161.20 - 166.48] have taken the cake when it comes down
[163.60 - 171.12] to killing birds. Chemtrails have taken
[166.48 - 173.76] out entire large flocks during migration
[171.12 - 176.16] or thousands upon thousands of birds
[173.76 - 178.80] just hit the ground, flop around and
[176.16 - 181.12] die. People have seen this before.
[178.80 - 183.68] They've watched it. Now, keep in mind,
[181.12 - 187.12] there's a lot of land. There is a lot of
[183.68 - 191.64] land people do not see or walk on. There
[187.12 - 194.80] are a lot of woods, forests, mountains,
[191.64 - 198.60] hills, valleys that people are not
[194.80 - 203.12] allowed on. Government land, classified
[198.60 - 206.64] land, land for testing, land for mining,
[203.12 - 209.28] or just endless swaths of land, vast
[206.64 - 212.24] amount of acres that nobody has access
[209.28 - 215.44] to. And even private land nobody has
[212.24 - 217.92] access to. But the birds do. They have
[215.44 - 221.12] access to this land. And the majority of
[217.92 - 225.04] the birds fly and die over this land.
[221.12 - 228.48] Die from chemtrails and land on the land
[225.04 - 230.96] dead or dying. And no one sees it.
[228.48 - 233.76] Millions and millions of birds over the
[230.96 - 236.64] years have fallen into these federal
[233.76 - 238.88] lands, into these private lands, into
[236.64 - 241.52] these forests, these hills, these
[238.88 - 244.88] valleys, on these mountains, and the
[241.52 - 248.00] death is not seen. These birds are not
[244.88 - 250.00] seen. The majority of them die this way
[248.00 - 252.40] in these places because there's that
[250.00 - 255.12] much land out there. There's that many
[252.40 - 258.48] acres out there that are not being used.
[255.12 - 261.20] And when birds die in the streets by the
[258.48 - 263.92] thousands, tens of thousands, even
[261.20 - 267.52] hundreds of thousands, and they die in a
[263.92 - 269.92] town or a city on a city highway, it's a
[267.52 - 273.04] shock. And people have seen it. They
[269.92 - 274.40] have they videotaped it. It's out there.
[273.04 - 277.04] People have seen it throughout the
[274.40 - 279.76] decades and talked about it, too. And
[277.04 - 282.16] it's a shocker. Birds falling out of the
[279.76 - 284.32] sky. But an hour later, it's just a
[282.16 - 287.36] bunch of dead birds. People drive over
[284.32 - 289.24] them. Vultures go and pick their bones.
[287.36 - 291.68] Maggots take over and they just
[289.24 - 293.44] disappear. No one's saying, "Hey,
[291.68 - 296.32] everything should stop right now. Let's
[293.44 - 298.48] examine this. Let's tape this area off.
[296.32 - 301.36] Let's call the authorities. Let's look
[298.48 - 303.28] at these birds. Let's do autopsies on
[301.36 - 304.96] these birds. Let's see what chemicals
[303.28 - 307.20] are in them. Let's see what's wrong. How
[304.96 - 309.60] did they die? What happened? Was it
[307.20 - 312.16] something in the sky? Did they get
[309.60 - 315.28] affected by something? Did something
[312.16 - 317.76] hurt them? What caused this? And right
[315.28 - 321.44] now, today, there's only two things that
[317.76 - 323.60] knock flocks of birds out of the sky.
[321.44 - 325.60] It's the bird flu, which is happening
[323.60 - 328.08] right now out there. The bird flu is
[325.60 - 329.92] rampid and flocks of birds are falling
[328.08 - 333.04] from the sky because they're infected by
[329.92 - 335.60] the bird flu. And chemtrails,
[333.04 - 337.92] geoengineering trails, both of them.
[335.60 - 340.48] That's the other thing that kills
[337.92 - 343.20] thousands and hundreds of thousands and
[340.48 - 346.40] millions of birds. But here's the thing,
[343.20 - 348.80] the bird flu is recent and just starting
[346.40 - 350.76] to take out birds. And that may grow
[348.80 - 353.76] worse over time. But right now,
[350.76 - 356.48] chemtrails and geoengineering trails
[353.76 - 358.68] dominate in bird killing. And the blood
[356.48 - 361.84] is on the hands of the chemtrail
[358.68 - 363.76] programs, the hierarchy, the elite
[361.84 - 366.32] that's secretly behind the chemtrails
[363.76 - 369.20] and geoengineering trails. The blood is
[366.32 - 370.96] on their hands, on their souls. And
[369.20 - 373.24] maybe some people don't really care
[370.96 - 376.00] about birds or think birds are
[373.24 - 378.40] important. They really are. And for too
[376.00 - 380.24] many reasons to count and this crime
[378.40 - 383.20] needs to be talked about and it needs to
[380.24 - 386.16] be seen. So, how have millions of birds
[383.20 - 388.88] died from chemtrails and geoengineering
[386.16 - 392.64] trails? To begin with, we need to talk
[388.88 - 395.44] about how high birds fly. The altitude
[392.64 - 398.56] that migration occurs, the altitude that
[395.44 - 401.68] birds fly at. When birds travel, they
[398.56 - 405.20] travel at a height anywhere between 300
[401.68 - 407.28] and 1,000 ft, depending on the species,
[405.20 - 409.44] because many birds fly even higher than
[407.28 - 411.44] that. There are many factors that
[409.44 - 414.24] determine this. Weather is one of the
[411.44 - 417.28] big ones. During migration, storms can
[414.24 - 419.84] force birds to fly much higher. And if a
[417.28 - 422.56] weather front is pushing low pressure,
[419.84 - 425.28] it forces the birds to fly higher. If a
[422.56 - 427.84] weather front is pushing high pressure,
[425.28 - 430.32] forces the birds to fly a little lower.
[427.84 - 432.32] So why does any of this even matter? It
[430.32 - 435.20] matters because we're talking about how
[432.32 - 437.36] the chemtrails kill the birds and how
[435.20 - 439.60] the geoengineering trails kill the
[437.36 - 441.80] birds. Now remember in the previous
[439.60 - 444.48] episodes I talked about how commercial
[441.80 - 447.68] airliners fly at an altitude around
[444.48 - 451.28] 30,000 ft and chemtrail planes fly
[447.68 - 454.48] around 20,000 ft, 15,000 ft and even
[451.28 - 457.92] 10,000 ft. And many chemtrail planes and
[454.48 - 460.88] geoengineering planes fly at 3,000 ft.
[457.92 - 462.88] Yes, 3,000 ft. Now how is it that
[460.88 - 465.84] chemtrail planes are flying this low
[462.88 - 468.88] 3,000 ft? They do this in mountainous
[465.84 - 471.28] regions. Now, if a chemtrail plane or
[468.88 - 473.44] geoengineering plane starts heading to a
[471.28 - 477.04] mountainous region and that chemtrail
[473.44 - 479.28] plane is flying at 10,000 ft and the
[477.04 - 482.40] small mountains ahead are anywhere from
[479.28 - 485.92] 3 to 4,000 ft above sea level, the
[482.40 - 488.72] chemtrail plane doesn't raise altitude,
[485.92 - 492.16] doesn't ascend or climb higher, stays at
[488.72 - 494.88] that altitude of 10,000 ft, and then
[492.16 - 497.28] closes in on the small mountain range,
[494.88 - 499.68] which is 3 to 4,000 ft. ft above sea
[497.28 - 503.28] level. So now that chemtrail plane is
[499.68 - 506.24] released 6,000 ft above sea level, 6,000
[503.28 - 509.68] ft the altitude. Now, this is important
[506.24 - 512.48] because a flock of birds migrating could
[509.68 - 516.24] be flying at an altitude from 2,000 to
[512.48 - 519.44] 5,000 ft above the mountainous range,
[516.24 - 522.96] leaving only a short distance of 1 to
[519.44 - 525.12] 2,000 ft from the chemtrail plane from
[522.96 - 527.44] the actual chemtrail being released out
[525.12 - 529.92] of the chemtrail plane. So, what's the
[527.44 - 532.48] chances of this happening? The chances
[529.92 - 534.64] are great, cuz it happens all the time.
[532.48 - 536.96] People see birds at the park or they see
[534.64 - 540.00] birds in their backyard, but the
[536.96 - 542.64] majority of the birds are migrating and
[540.00 - 545.04] passing over mountainous regions. And
[542.64 - 547.68] the distance between that chemtrail,
[545.04 - 550.48] between that geoengineering trail is
[547.68 - 553.60] close, very close to the birds. Now, for
[550.48 - 556.64] example, ducks can fly and migrate up to
[553.60 - 558.72] 10,000 ft. And regardless of mountainous
[556.64 - 561.92] regions, and we're just talking about
[558.72 - 565.60] land close to sea level, ducks flying at
[561.92 - 568.96] 10,000 ft will match a chemtrail plane
[565.60 - 572.08] flying at 10,000 ft. So simplifying it a
[568.96 - 574.72] little bit, birds fly high, chemtrail
[572.08 - 577.36] planes fly low, birds get caught into
[574.72 - 580.24] the chemtrails themselves and get
[577.36 - 582.24] snuffed out and then die. And we're not
[580.24 - 584.56] just talking about a few birds. We're
[582.24 - 588.24] talking about thousands of birds, tens
[584.56 - 589.92] of thousands in just a flock migrating.
[588.24 - 593.68] We're talking about a massive amount of
[589.92 - 596.40] birds dying close to death almost at
[593.68 - 599.36] exactly the same time. And keep in mind,
[596.40 - 601.12] every batch lot in the plane, every
[599.36 - 602.80] group of chemicals that they have that
[601.12 - 605.04] they're dumping, whether it's
[602.80 - 607.44] geoengineering planes or a chemtrail
[605.04 - 610.72] plane, can be different at any given
[607.44 - 613.40] time. So, some concoctions could be
[610.72 - 615.60] instantly deadly, while some are
[613.40 - 618.00] intoxicating and dangerous enough to
[615.60 - 620.40] weaken the birds, causing their flight
[618.00 - 622.80] pattern to be disturbed, causing them to
[620.40 - 624.80] weaken and have to drop out of the sky,
[622.80 - 627.12] causing them to have to land early for
[624.80 - 629.52] the day, which could ruin everything for
[627.12 - 632.32] them on the day after, depending about
[629.52 - 634.72] the weather, disturbing the process of
[632.32 - 638.24] nature, destroying the very birds we
[634.72 - 641.44] love. So, how do 10,000 birds die at a
[638.24 - 643.84] clip? How does it really happen? To
[641.44 - 647.12] begin with, as the chemtrails are
[643.84 - 650.08] released into the sky, or geoengineering
[647.12 - 652.96] trails are being released in the sky, as
[650.08 - 655.36] the deadly metals and deadly chemicals
[652.96 - 658.48] are being pumped out of tanks that sit
[655.36 - 661.76] inside of the jet planes, they begin to
[658.48 - 664.88] enter the airspace, creating a trail.
[661.76 - 668.08] And that trail begins at around 100 ft
[664.88 - 672.16] wide. And as the plane keeps on flying,
[668.08 - 675.68] that trail becomes not just a mile long,
[672.16 - 680.00] but it can go about 20 m long. Now, some
[675.68 - 683.28] chemtrails can go 10 m long, some 20,
[680.00 - 685.84] and some even 50 m long depending on the
[683.28 - 688.64] speed of the plane. Now, as the
[685.84 - 692.00] chemtrail or geoengineering trail sits
[688.64 - 695.04] in the sky, it starts to drop slowly,
[692.00 - 698.40] but not just drops slowly. It starts to
[695.04 - 701.52] spread out. It starts to expand. Now,
[698.40 - 704.80] exhaust fumes aren't chemtrails. So,
[701.52 - 708.40] when a engine is burning fuel and that
[704.80 - 711.12] fuel is turning into exhaust fumes, that
[708.40 - 713.12] is not a chemtrail. Now, a lot of people
[711.12 - 716.24] that believe in chemtrails and talk
[713.12 - 719.12] about chemtrails out there believe it's
[716.24 - 721.60] chemicals in the fuel tank. So, it's
[719.12 - 723.84] chemicals in the fuel itself and it's
[721.60 - 727.12] what the planes are actually burning.
[723.84 - 729.84] And the trail is that trail coming from
[727.12 - 732.32] the engines. But that's not true. That's
[729.84 - 735.20] not how it works. You can't put all of
[732.32 - 737.04] those toxic chemicals in fuel and expect
[735.20 - 739.36] a plane to fly. It's not going to
[737.04 - 742.48] happen. And with geoengineering, you
[739.36 - 746.64] can't put weather modification chemicals
[742.48 - 749.76] like barerium, like metals and solvents
[746.64 - 752.56] inside a fuel tank and expect that to be
[749.76 - 754.56] released and alter the weather. That's
[752.56 - 757.04] not going to happen either. All of these
[754.56 - 760.32] chemicals and metals and pollutants and
[757.04 - 762.32] toxins are released from tanks that are
[760.32 - 764.96] inside the planes. The planes are
[762.32 - 766.72] hollowed out. The tanks are installed.
[764.96 - 770.24] All the chemicals are filled into those
[766.72 - 772.80] tanks and then the pilot clicks a switch
[770.24 - 775.68] and then the contents of those tanks are
[772.80 - 779.08] released out of the side of the jet.
[775.68 - 781.52] Now, normally the injection valves and
[779.08 - 784.64] injectors, these little pipes where the
[781.52 - 787.60] contents are released, squirted out into
[784.64 - 789.84] the air, are located near the engines.
[787.60 - 792.88] They locate these near the engines on
[789.84 - 797.20] purpose for a reason. So that if someone
[792.88 - 799.68] sees this with a telescope or binoculars
[797.20 - 801.60] or they happen to be living in an area
[799.68 - 805.68] where they see it in a better way,
[801.60 - 808.96] clear, like on a perfectly clear day, or
[805.68 - 811.68] if one of the chemtrail planes is flying
[808.96 - 814.36] lower than normal, and someone happens
[811.68 - 817.52] to see that the contents are being
[814.36 - 819.84] released nowhere near the engines, and
[817.52 - 822.48] then it gets suspicious where it looks
[819.84 - 824.96] like the trails are being injected out
[822.48 - 827.60] of little pipes at different areas of
[824.96 - 830.24] the plane. Now, the chemtrail programs
[827.60 - 833.28] and the geoengineering programs and the
[830.24 - 836.28] hierarchy behind it all do not want
[833.28 - 839.52] people to see that. So, the pipes, the
[836.28 - 842.16] injectors, the injector valves are
[839.52 - 845.04] actually positioned near the engines.
[842.16 - 848.24] Now, now in the old days, it wasn't like
[845.04 - 850.96] that. Nowadays, because of the amount of
[848.24 - 853.60] people having the technology to really
[850.96 - 856.32] hone in on these planes, they have to do
[853.60 - 859.76] it differently. Back in the 1990s and
[856.32 - 862.56] the early 2000s, you can clearly see the
[859.76 - 864.72] injector sights on the planes. They were
[862.56 - 867.28] different. They weren't in the position
[864.72 - 869.84] of the engines. They were away from the
[867.28 - 872.48] engines. And it was more than obvious
[869.84 - 876.32] that it was actually being done. Now
[872.48 - 879.04] even now in 2025 not every plane is set
[876.32 - 881.68] up like that they are away from the
[879.04 - 884.96] engines. Many of them you can tell and
[881.68 - 888.80] you can see that. But a lot more planes
[884.96 - 891.84] the injector pipes are stationed near
[888.80 - 894.16] the engines now. So they're upgrading.
[891.84 - 897.20] They're changing it up so it looks like
[894.16 - 899.52] a contrail instead of a chemtrail. So,
[897.20 - 902.24] as these chemtrails and geoengineering
[899.52 - 903.96] trails leave the plane, they're not
[902.24 - 906.16] leaving as
[903.96 - 909.84] exhaust. The reason why I'm talking
[906.16 - 912.96] about this is because when exhaust fumes
[909.84 - 916.48] enter the air and they leave the jet
[912.96 - 920.48] engine or even the car engine or truck
[916.48 - 924.16] engine or bus engine, oxygen from the
[920.48 - 928.08] air will interdisperse between it after
[924.16 - 930.72] it's been released. oxygen will enter it
[928.08 - 933.60] and help it disperse. So that when
[930.72 - 936.40] you're walking across a street and a car
[933.60 - 939.44] just went by and you're smelling exhaust
[936.40 - 942.08] fumes, there's still oxygen there with
[939.44 - 945.92] it. You're still breathing in both.
[942.08 - 948.96] There's still a mix of air, oxygen, with
[945.92 - 952.88] those fumes, with that smog because
[948.96 - 955.60] you're 20 ft away, 30 ft away, 10 ft
[952.88 - 957.92] away, or much more. The air you're
[955.60 - 959.60] breathing has a mix in it. It has a mix
[957.92 - 961.76] of the exhaust fumes that came out of
[959.60 - 963.92] the pipe and a mix of the air that's
[961.76 - 966.40] surrounding it. So, you're getting
[963.92 - 969.36] oxygen at the same time you're smelling
[966.40 - 971.80] the exhaust fumes. Now, the jet engines
[969.36 - 974.88] do the same thing. They're releasing
[971.80 - 977.28] exhaust. Fuel is burning up there. And
[974.88 - 979.44] when the planes are on the runway and
[977.28 - 982.24] the guys that work on the tarmac
[979.44 - 984.64] directing those planes, they breathe in
[982.24 - 987.20] the exhaust fumes from the jet engines,
[984.64 - 989.52] but they're also breathing in oxygen
[987.20 - 992.32] from the air that's surrounding them as
[989.52 - 994.80] well that's mixing in with the fumes
[992.32 - 998.16] from the jet engines. They're breathing
[994.80 - 1000.48] in some oxygen staying alive while
[998.16 - 1002.56] walking around the tarmac, walking on
[1000.48 - 1004.80] the runway, and walking around the jet
[1002.56 - 1007.52] engines. So, why are we talking about
[1004.80 - 1011.76] this? And why does any of this matter?
[1007.52 - 1014.88] Because when 10,000 to 20,000 or 50,000
[1011.76 - 1018.00] birds die in a clip, there's a reason
[1014.88 - 1020.48] for it. And the reason isn't exhaust
[1018.00 - 1021.92] fumes coming out of a jet plane in the
[1020.48 - 1024.04] sky.
[1021.92 - 1027.60] 50,000 birds
[1024.04 - 1029.84] migrating, flying, don't die from
[1027.60 - 1033.60] breathing in some exhaust fumes mixed
[1029.84 - 1036.16] with air mixed with oxygen in the sky.
[1033.60 - 1039.20] They don't breathe in exhaust fumes from
[1036.16 - 1041.92] a jet engine and all fall to the ground
[1039.20 - 1044.24] and die. It doesn't work like that.
[1041.92 - 1047.16] Something else is killing them. And as
[1044.24 - 1050.80] the planes are flying and the fuel is
[1047.16 - 1054.56] burning and the exhaust is venting, that
[1050.80 - 1057.36] exhaust interdisperses with the air and
[1054.56 - 1060.56] there's oxygen in that air and oxygen
[1057.36 - 1063.84] stays in that air. And yes, that exhaust
[1060.56 - 1065.92] fume is toxic. And yes, if you were too
[1063.84 - 1069.28] close to the engine, it would not be
[1065.92 - 1071.44] good. But birds are not dying because of
[1069.28 - 1073.92] it. Now, when it comes down to a
[1071.44 - 1077.16] chemtrail being released, something
[1073.92 - 1081.00] different happens. The contents in a
[1077.16 - 1084.88] chemtrail are so toxic that when they're
[1081.00 - 1086.76] released, oxygen cannot sustain itself
[1084.88 - 1089.80] within it. And there's a reason for
[1086.76 - 1093.36] that. Because the contents in that
[1089.80 - 1097.04] chemtrail eat up oxygen. They destroy
[1093.36 - 1099.84] it. This means that when air intermixes
[1097.04 - 1103.36] with the chemtrail, it's different than
[1099.84 - 1106.32] air intermixing with exhaust. The free
[1103.36 - 1109.28] radicals are so deadly in a chemtrail
[1106.32 - 1112.00] that it destroys oxygen instantly,
[1109.28 - 1113.92] providing no hope at all for a flock of
[1112.00 - 1116.40] birds to survive when entering a
[1113.92 - 1118.80] chemtrail or when a chemtrail is
[1116.40 - 1122.16] descending upon a flock of birds that
[1118.80 - 1126.32] are migrating. So when a chemtrail is 50
[1122.16 - 1130.24] ft wide, 100 ft wide and then expands
[1126.32 - 1134.32] more and more and becomes 500 ft wide
[1130.24 - 1137.52] and becomes 1,000 ft wide and then
[1134.32 - 1140.16] becomes 2,000 ft wide and eventually
[1137.52 - 1143.44] becoming more than 5,000 ft wide. There
[1140.16 - 1146.00] is nowhere to go, nowhere to breathe.
[1143.44 - 1148.56] Birds can't survive in that. They can't
[1146.00 - 1151.24] sustain themselves in that. Now, if
[1148.56 - 1154.40] birds are far enough underneath a
[1151.24 - 1157.24] chemtrail, it's safer. It's different.
[1154.40 - 1159.12] They can survive their flight pattern
[1157.24 - 1161.68] eventually going in a different
[1159.12 - 1164.16] direction of that chemtrail. It's all
[1161.68 - 1166.88] about Russian roulette. It's all about
[1164.16 - 1169.20] hit or miss. It's all about being in the
[1166.88 - 1171.60] right place at the right time, wrong
[1169.20 - 1174.16] place at the wrong time for birds
[1171.60 - 1177.76] because deadly free radicals use up
[1174.16 - 1180.88] oxygen. They destroy and eat up oxygen.
[1177.76 - 1183.92] So oxygen cannot exist within it. It
[1180.88 - 1187.48] cannot interdisperse or mix in on any
[1183.92 - 1190.16] level. It gets used up, burned out
[1187.48 - 1192.32] immediately. What this means for birds
[1190.16 - 1195.92] at the wrong time, wrong place is
[1192.32 - 1197.44] immediate death. Now that's why millions
[1195.92 - 1201.36] of birds have been falling out of the
[1197.44 - 1204.96] sky for years. That's why 10,000 at a
[1201.36 - 1208.16] time, 20,000 as a clip, land on roads
[1204.96 - 1211.20] and villages or forests where no one
[1208.16 - 1214.40] ever sees it or sees them. Now, the lung
[1211.20 - 1216.88] of a bird is able to take in air at a
[1214.40 - 1218.60] speed and velocity that the bird flies.
[1216.88 - 1222.00] And the lung of a bird takes
[1218.60 - 1224.48] approximately one breath per flap when
[1222.00 - 1226.96] flying at an elevated altitude. Now, the
[1224.48 - 1229.36] lung of a bird is able to process oxygen
[1226.96 - 1232.24] differently than humans because when
[1229.36 - 1234.96] migrating, a bird flies high, where
[1232.24 - 1237.20] there's less oxygen, where the air is
[1234.96 - 1238.80] thinner. Now, even though birds are
[1237.20 - 1240.96] designed for this, it's still a
[1238.80 - 1242.88] struggle. It's still difficult. It's
[1240.96 - 1245.28] difficult for them to get oxygen when
[1242.88 - 1247.52] flying that high. But it's the only way
[1245.28 - 1249.76] to keep up with migration, to make the
[1247.52 - 1253.76] distance for survival. Now, there's a
[1249.76 - 1257.36] rule of thumb for birds. Fly or die. fly
[1253.76 - 1259.68] or starve because food runs out. Not all
[1257.36 - 1262.48] birds, but most birds have to fly away
[1259.68 - 1264.40] to another area to collect food. Which
[1262.48 - 1266.96] brings us to the reality, the grim
[1264.40 - 1269.72] reality that over time, it's all the
[1266.96 - 1272.24] birds that migrate that fly in large
[1269.72 - 1274.56] flocks that will eventually get affected
[1272.24 - 1276.72] by the chemtrails and most likely die
[1274.56 - 1278.48] because of them. If it's not the bird
[1276.72 - 1280.88] flu that gets them, it's going to be the
[1278.48 - 1282.80] chemtrails that gets them in the end.
[1280.88 - 1285.28] Birds that stick around all year and
[1282.80 - 1288.32] don't migrate won't be affected so
[1285.28 - 1290.08] severely by chemtrails, just partially
[1288.32 - 1292.16] because it's in the air, just like
[1290.08 - 1294.64] humans get affected partially because
[1292.16 - 1297.04] it's in the air. So, as a chemtrail is
[1294.64 - 1300.40] released from a plane and starts to
[1297.04 - 1303.44] descend upon a flock of birds migrating,
[1300.40 - 1306.32] oxygen literally gets dissolved out of
[1303.44 - 1309.84] the sky through a chemical interaction
[1306.32 - 1312.12] of highly toxic chemicals intermingling
[1309.84 - 1314.72] with oxygen itself. A chemical
[1312.12 - 1317.52] combustion where the oxygen gets
[1314.72 - 1320.52] vaporized instantly. Now, as birds
[1317.52 - 1323.36] either fly into this chemtrail or a
[1320.52 - 1326.80] chemtrail descends upon a flock of birds
[1323.36 - 1330.00] flying and the birds begin to inhale
[1326.80 - 1332.80] that chemtrail and those chemtrails,
[1330.00 - 1336.08] those toxins enter the lungs of the
[1332.80 - 1338.80] bird, any oxygen within the bird's lungs
[1336.08 - 1341.44] gets vaporized immediately. The same
[1338.80 - 1344.32] chemical interaction occurs. This then
[1341.44 - 1346.40] leads to the bloodstream. As the toxins
[1344.32 - 1350.72] enter the bloodstream through the bird's
[1346.40 - 1352.96] lungs, it begins to vaporize all oxygen
[1350.72 - 1355.92] that's in the bloodstream itself and
[1352.96 - 1358.16] organs of the bird. Oxygen gets sucked
[1355.92 - 1361.76] right out of the bird. And this is why
[1358.16 - 1365.68] not just three birds out of 50 birds die
[1361.76 - 1369.28] or 100 birds out of 5,000 birds die.
[1365.68 - 1372.56] Instead, all 5,000 birds die. or even
[1369.28 - 1375.44] 50,000 birds in a massive flock die all
[1372.56 - 1377.76] at once. This is the sinister assault on
[1375.44 - 1380.64] birds that occurs. Now, if there are
[1377.76 - 1383.28] birds on the edge of the flock that are
[1380.64 - 1385.12] on the edge of the trail or birds that
[1383.28 - 1388.08] are on the edge of the trail, the far
[1385.12 - 1391.36] edge or the trail as it's descending
[1388.08 - 1394.28] upon the flock is missing hitting some
[1391.36 - 1397.76] of the birds and they only get partially
[1394.28 - 1400.80] sickened. They may go down as well, land
[1397.76 - 1403.68] on the ground, flap around before they
[1400.80 - 1406.16] die versus all the other birds landing
[1403.68 - 1409.12] on the ground already dead. They died up
[1406.16 - 1412.96] in the sky. Now, birds flapping around
[1409.12 - 1415.28] on the ground sickened by the chemtrails
[1412.96 - 1417.60] die with a delayed effect. They can't
[1415.28 - 1419.52] survive it even if they were given help.
[1417.60 - 1421.60] The reason why is because the poison is
[1419.52 - 1424.24] still in their system and dissolving the
[1421.60 - 1426.32] oxygen, taking it out of their organs
[1424.24 - 1428.88] and out of their blood. They're just
[1426.32 - 1431.52] having a slower death from having less
[1428.88 - 1434.00] of the poison. But still, in the end,
[1431.52 - 1436.64] they die from it. Now, birds are
[1434.00 - 1438.40] profound spiritual creatures. So, it's
[1436.64 - 1441.36] not a surprise that the chemtrol
[1438.40 - 1443.68] programs and the geoengineering programs
[1441.36 - 1446.72] are killing the birds at the pace that
[1443.68 - 1449.28] they're doing so. The hierarchy or the
[1446.72 - 1451.76] shadow government and others that are
[1449.28 - 1453.88] responsible for the chemtrail programs
[1451.76 - 1457.04] and for the classified geoengineering
[1453.88 - 1459.28] programs bask in the practice of killing
[1457.04 - 1461.84] such profound spiritual creatures like
[1459.28 - 1464.24] birds, which now takes us to a different
[1461.84 - 1467.28] topic, but yet it's a topic that's
[1464.24 - 1469.76] related. How did the birds get here? Not
[1467.28 - 1472.80] all birds were naturally created here on
[1469.76 - 1475.28] this planet, planet Earth. Many birds
[1472.80 - 1477.40] were brought here from afar, from
[1475.28 - 1480.48] distant planets by
[1477.40 - 1482.32] extraterrestrials. So man on this planet
[1480.48 - 1486.16] that are using these chemtrails and
[1482.32 - 1488.80] destroying these birds are in violation
[1486.16 - 1491.04] of extraterrestrial laws that brought
[1488.80 - 1494.60] the birds here to begin with, which is
[1491.04 - 1496.48] another reason that over time aliens,
[1494.60 - 1499.04] extraterrestrials will not put up with
[1496.48 - 1501.60] the chemtrails and the geoengineering
[1499.04 - 1503.68] trails. I hope you enjoyed this episode.

[1564.72 - 1569.60] you read me?
[1566.28 - 1571.80] Over. This is flight 666 to the base.
[1569.60 - 1575.52] What can I do for you?
[1571.80 - 1577.60] Over. Flight 666. There's reports you
[1575.52 - 1580.72] haven't released any chemicals today.
[1577.60 - 1582.88] Over. This is flight 666 to the base.
[1580.72 - 1586.88] The day is still early. I still have one
[1582.88 - 1589.20] more hour to go, sir. Over. Flight 666.
[1586.88 - 1591.60] This is the base. Give us a report. Give
[1589.20 - 1594.12] us the reason. Is there a malfunction?
[1591.60 - 1597.64] Why haven't you released the chemicals?
[1594.12 - 1600.96] Over. This is flight 666 to the base,
[1597.64 - 1604.00] sir. Well, quite frankly, it's
[1600.96 - 1605.68] migration, sir. Lots of birds flying.
[1604.00 - 1608.00] Just waiting for an opportunity to
[1605.68 - 1611.84] release the chemicals, sir. No harm
[1608.00 - 1614.40] done. Over. Flight 666. This is the
[1611.84 - 1618.08] base. Release the chemicals. Open up
[1614.40 - 1621.28] injectors. Over, sir. This is flight
[1618.08 - 1623.72] 666. Can't quite read you. Uh, breaking
[1621.28 - 1627.52] up, sir. Breaking up. Transmission not
[1623.72 - 1630.92] coherent. Over. Flight 666. This is the
[1627.52 - 1632.88] base. Stop fooling around. Release the
[1630.92 - 1637.12] chemicals. This is going to be a strike
[1632.88 - 1640.64] on your record. Over. This is flight 666
[1637.12 - 1643.20] to the base. May I ask a question, sir?
[1640.64 - 1645.76] Do you like birds, sir? You see, at
[1643.20 - 1647.52] home, we have some bird feeders up, and
[1645.76 - 1651.84] we watch the birds every day through the
[1647.52 - 1654.24] kitchen window, sir. And right now, I'm
[1651.84 - 1656.40] kind of giving the birds a little chance
[1654.24 - 1658.52] just to get out of my way, sir. Nothing
[1656.40 - 1661.92] more than that.
[1658.52 - 1663.84] Over. Flight 666. This is the base. It
[1661.92 - 1666.16] would be in your best interest if you
[1663.84 - 1667.84] release all chemicals now. There's more
[1666.16 - 1671.08] problems that come along with defying
[1667.84 - 1674.88] orders beyond insubordination. Flight
[1671.08 - 1677.28] 666, open up all injectors now. This is
[1674.88 - 1680.16] flight 666 to the base. Opening up all
[1677.28 - 1683.28] injectors, turning all switches on.
[1680.16 - 1686.40] Releasing full 50,000 gallons of content
[1683.28 - 1689.84] as we speak, sir. Over. Very good.
[1686.40 - 1692.20] Flight 666. This is flight 666. Roger
[1689.84 - 1695.20] that, base.
[1692.20 - 1695.20] Over.
[1711.24 - 1715.68] Original published medical medium
[1713.44 - 1718.24] information gets stolen and poached by
[1715.68 - 1720.08] podcast doctors, social media doctors,
[1718.24 - 1721.92] influencers, and medical clinics.
[1720.08 - 1723.68] Medical medium information has never yet
[1721.92 - 1725.76] been proven wrong by medical science and
[1723.68 - 1727.44] research. Instead, the opposite, only
[1725.76 - 1729.28] proven right and then taken from medical
[1727.44 - 1730.96] medium published material and used in
[1729.28 - 1733.04] the conventional and alternative health
[1730.96 - 1734.96] communities. Medical medium information
[1733.04 - 1736.48] continually sets the stage for medical
[1734.96 - 1738.48] science to understand chronic illness
[1736.48 - 1740.40] better. If you choose to share or use
[1738.48 - 1742.40] the original unique content from the
[1740.40 - 1744.64] Medical Medium podcast, books, or
[1742.40 - 1746.32] Medical Medium social media, please site
[1744.64 - 1747.60] where this information comes from so
[1746.32 - 1749.20] others who see and learn of this
[1747.60 - 1750.72] information have a chance to know where
[1749.20 - 1752.48] it all originates to give them an
[1750.72 - 1754.24] opportunity to heal so they don't end up
[1752.48 - 1756.16] losing years of their life searching for
[1754.24 - 1758.08] answers like so many have before them.
[1756.16 - 1760.00] The medical medium information here on
[1758.08 - 1761.92] this podcast doesn't come from broken
[1760.00 - 1763.92] science, interest groups, medical
[1761.92 - 1766.64] funding with strings attached, botched
[1763.92 - 1768.80] research, lobbyists, internal kickbacks,
[1766.64 - 1770.80] persuaded belief systems, private panels
[1768.80 - 1772.56] of influencers, health field payoffs,
[1770.80 - 1774.32] trendy traps, or gathered bits and
[1772.56 - 1776.32] pieces of gimmicky confusion. Because
[1774.32 - 1778.16] chronic illness is exploding like never
[1776.32 - 1780.08] before in our modern-day history, it
[1778.16 - 1781.92] takes a greater force than us down here.
[1780.08 - 1783.68] It takes a helping hand from above.
[1781.92 - 1785.28] Medical medium information has street
[1783.68 - 1786.56] cred. It's an organic movement of
[1785.28 - 1788.32] countless people around the world
[1786.56 - 1790.08] healing more healing stories of real
[1788.32 - 1792.24] people not being paid to tell their
[1790.08 - 1793.84] life-changing experiences of rising out
[1792.24 - 1796.00] of the ashes of sickness and entering
[1793.84 - 1797.60] into the light of full recovery, getting
[1796.00 - 1799.20] their lives back, and finally healing
[1797.60 - 1800.64] when nothing else in the world of health
[1799.20 - 1802.64] could move the needle and get them
[1800.64 - 1805.04] better. The information on this podcast
[1802.64 - 1806.88] is not man-made. It comes from above,
[1805.04 - 1808.80] from a higher source. Whatever you
[1806.88 - 1810.72] believe in, whether God, the universe,
[1808.80 - 1812.00] the light, or the creator, or if you
[1810.72 - 1813.36] believe in nothing at all, that we're
[1812.00 - 1815.04] just floating through space together on
[1813.36 - 1816.88] this rock, know that the information you
[1815.04 - 1818.64] hear on this podcast is separate from
[1816.88 - 1820.32] all the other noise out there. It comes
[1818.64 - 1822.80] from a different place. A pure
[1820.32 - 1825.84] untampered with advanced clean
[1822.80 - 1830.16] uncorrupted original primary source. A
[1825.84 - 1830.16] higher source, spirit of compassion.
