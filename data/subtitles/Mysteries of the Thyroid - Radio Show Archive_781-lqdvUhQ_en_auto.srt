been a the in young age before and after

142
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,039
when I asked Spirit later on when I

143
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:33,960
started getting a little bit older I

144
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:36,560
asked Spirit can we do something else

145
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:38,120
because I I'm seeing everybody in this

146
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,280
in suffering I see they have all these

147
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,960
illnesses so when I was a child I was

148
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,759
telling Spirit what else can we do it

149
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:47,400
was really overwhelming and spirit said

150
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:49,199
well we can do the light so um I did the

151
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:51,280

into it now um here's the deal with

222
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:44,039
thyroid here's the deal the most

223
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:47,839
important thing to understand is the

224
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:49,560
great mistake the great mistake okay

225
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,240
this is the great mistake and and I'm

226
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:53,279
going to sound like sound funny with

227
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:55,440
this one again but it's the great

228
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:57,360
mistake that's buried a knife brought to

229
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,640
the attention of the medical world

230
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,600
communities and everyone else right now

231
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,839
this mistake you're only going to hear

232
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:07,040
over here and I've I've you know

233
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:10,079
uncovered this mistake so you can heal

234
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:13,399
and thankfully from Spirit and the

235
00:09:10,079 --> 00:09:15,920
mistake is autoimmune it's the great

236
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:18,880
mistake is autoimmune understanding

237
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,760
autoimmune now we're told our body

238
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,000
attacks itself and I talked about this

239
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:25,519
in other shows but you got to hear it

240
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,279
when it comes down Hashimoto thyroiditis

241
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:31,079
when it comes down to thyroid conditions

242
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:32,880
and we're told our body attacks itself

243
00:09:31,079 --> 00:09:34,839
so if we have Hashi if we were diagnosed

244
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,880
with Hashimoto thyroiditis and keep in

245
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:39,519
mind Hashim Modas is just the name of

246
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:42,519
some guy a long time ago that actually

247
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:44,760
woke up one morning went to work okay as

248
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:47,399
a doctor went to work a patient came in

249
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:50,600
and he felt their thyroid and he said by

250
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:55,560
golly I think your thyroids inflamed and

251
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:58,760
that's all we know today all these years

252
00:09:55,560 --> 00:10:00,959
all these decades it's all we know about

253
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:03,279
Hashim moous thyroiditis until the

254
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,800
release of the medical medium book okay

255
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:07,720
till the release of the medical medium

256
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:09,519
book where thank God I've been able to

257
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:11,720
um and thank Spirit of course been able

258
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:14,279
to get the information out there so what

259
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:16,800
happened was a doctor woke up and one

260
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:19,480
morning went to work and said well my

261
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,600
patient's thyroids inflamed so

262
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:23,920
thyroiditis was the name for

263
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:27,399
inflammation ashim modus was the name of

264
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:30,160
the doctor and that's it and so we live

265
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:31,440
by this rule where we go to the doctor I

266
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,839
see people all the time they go to the

267
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,200
doctor and they they get their first

268
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:37,240
diagnosis and they walk out of the

269
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:40,360
doctor's office

270
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:42,639
baffled first of all they're accepting

271
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:44,000
the fact that they're accepting the fact

272
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:45,279
that the medical research and medical

273
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,880
science thinks they know what they're

274
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,440
doing or talking about that's not the

275
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,079
doctor's fault it's about research and

276
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:53,240
Science and they accept it like okay

277
00:10:51,079 --> 00:10:55,399
what does this mean and they walk out

278
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:56,399
confused baffled totally just don't

279
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:59,200
understand what's going on and

280
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,800
rightfully so rightfully so I would and

281
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,399
second if I was just someone who didn't

282
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,480
know much about medical stuff but I know

283
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:05,839
everybody's an expert in their own

284
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,279
fields and they know information about

285
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,760
other things but they may not know a lot

286
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,680
about the medical field they walk in

287
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:13,360
they get a

288
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:14,600
diagnosis um and they walk out and they

289
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,320
just got told that their body's

290
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:19,079
attacking itself that their body is

291
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:21,279
destroying their thyroid okay first of

292
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:23,200
all that's not accurate and for the

293
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:25,040
first time in history we're changing

294
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,560
that or bringing that information and

295
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,760
that's why you guys got to stay you know

296
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:31,839
you got to stay holding on to the these

297
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,839
these shows because I need you to have

298
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:36,120
this information cuz you're spreading

299
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:38,240
the word I hear it happening now the

300
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:41,240
word's spreading I mean this is a

301
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,680
blessing because we're helping people

302
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:45,079
and I'm helping you you're helping

303
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:47,000
others and and that's that's like my

304
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:49,040
prayers have been answered and they've

305
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,079
been answered with that because when

306
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,800
you're a young woman and you get told

307
00:11:51,079 --> 00:11:54,680
you got Hashimoto thyroiditis and your

308
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:57,120
body's attacking itself you instantly

309
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:59,519
plant a seed a seed is planted a

310
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:05,000
poisonous poisonous

311
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:07,440
um um seed venomous seed is planted in

312
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
the body in the brain that your body has

313
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,839
betrayed you it is cutting your legs

314
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,399
from out from under you basically it's

315
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:16,600
backstabbing you it's breaking

316
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,959
trust and you go home you tell your

317
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,639
husband you tell your fiance you tell

318
00:12:17,959 --> 00:12:21,720
your boyfriend or you just go home and

319
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:23,880
tell your best friend your soulmate that

320
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:25,279
my body's turned against me because

321
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:27,000
that's what happens I'm watching it

322
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:29,519
every day and finally I said you know

323
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:33,040
what something has to be done about this

324
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:36,000
something has to be done first of all

325
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:38,240
there's an auto an antibody an auto

326
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,440
antibody that's discovered by research

327
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:45,360
and science through blood work that auto

328
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:48,600
antibody is not attacking the thyroid

329
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:51,279
gland like medical research thinks

330
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:54,959
instead it's produced by your immune

331
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:58,079
system to attack the virus called

332
00:12:54,959 --> 00:13:02,560
abstein bar that's attacking your

333
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:05,519
thyroid the inflammation in your thyroid

334
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:09,600
is caused by Epstein bar creating the

335
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:13,360
inflammation the vipin bar is creating

336
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:16,839
inflammation in the thyroid gland as it

337
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:19,480
Burrows itself in your body has no

338
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:22,560
responsibility in attacking itself and

339
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:25,120
is not by any means never would never

340
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:27,760
was and it doesn't in any autoimmune

341
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:32,680
disease or diagnosis that's out there

342
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:36,000
nowe please take in that information

343
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:40,160
please because it is

344
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:42,079
lifesaving lifesaving I repeat okay

345
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:45,600
because it's the truth and it's life

346
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:47,800
saving and so those Auto antibodies

347
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,720
they're going in they're going in to get

348
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:51,320
the Epstein bar they're not causing

349
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,880
inflammation the inflammation already

350
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:55,440
occurred it's already happening and it

351
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:58,480
continues to happen with Epstein bar

352
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,360
doing its thing and this is how it's

353
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,600
done

354
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,360
this is what's happening okay it all

355
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,920
starts out with mononucleosis now you

356
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,600
don't even have to remember having mono

357
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:09,240
because not everybody gets diagnosed

358
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:11,920
with mono when they're sick in fact not

359
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:14,839
a lot of people really do it's just

360
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:16,399
those more bad cases of mononucleosis

361
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:17,839
where you're just so sick that you go to

362
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,399
the doctor's office and you get your

363
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:23,160
first mon mononucleosis

364
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:24,600
diagnosis um relatively most people have

365
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:26,399
a sore throat for a week and never even

366
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,959
go to a doctor sore throat goes away and

367
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,240
they had a mild kiss Amano and it goes

368
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:32,519
away and that's it

369
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:35,519
it goes away get leaves the bloodstream

370
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:38,199
it hides itself in the liver and sits in

371
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:41,759
there for a long time until stress

372
00:14:38,199 --> 00:14:45,920
deficiencies immune system uh weaknesses

373
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:48,800
um anything losses that we go through uh

374
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:50,639
anything happens emotionally um you know

375
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:54,360
meaning stress meaning things that break

376
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:56,160
us down all of that and then with that

377
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:58,240
you know bad food that we eat and

378
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:02,480
everything else around bad foods and

379
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:04,680
then it comes out it comes out and heads

380
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,880
to the thyroid causing

381
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:09,519
hypothyroidism that's what Epstein bar

382
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:12,680
does so this is stage three of Epstein

383
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:15,279
bar it heads to the thyroid and it's not

384
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:16,920
going to be diagnosable as Epstein bar

385
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:19,240
because that's only when it's in its

386
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:20,800
mononucleosis phase all this information

387
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,880
you can only hear here you can hear it

388
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,959
you can just read it in the medical

389
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:27,160
medium book and in the future books I'm

390
00:15:23,959 --> 00:15:28,440
putting out but this is how it works now

391
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:30,959
science and research is going to get

392
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:32,360
there down the road um and they are

393
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,800
going to find out and figure it out and

394
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,639
they are going to work on it and then

395
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:38,720
maybe this will be remedied some of this

396
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:41,519
stuff but we're not there yet and it may

397
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,519
take another 20 years so we got to do

398
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,759
something about our health and our

399
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:45,160
children's health and our family's

400
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,839
health and all our loved ones and we

401
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,399
have to do something and we have to

402
00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:50,079
fight for this a little bit have to

403
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,000
fight what's for what's right and we got

404
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:54,279
to get ourselves better and we got to

405
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,639
protect ourselves because here's the

406
00:15:54,279 --> 00:15:58,680
deal Medical Research Medical Science

407
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:01,199
doesn't have answers for something you

408
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:03,720
have to take the blame then you have to

409
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:06,639
take the blame I'm just telling you how

410
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:08,959
the system works okay there's a lot of

411
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:11,160
issues in the medical system that we

412
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:13,399
know about that are evident that there's

413
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:15,319
other people talking about this one here

414
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:18,199
no one's talking about and it's the most

415
00:16:15,319 --> 00:16:19,759
important it's the most important out of

416
00:16:18,199 --> 00:16:22,680
them all it's the greatest mistake of

417
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:25,079
all time in medical history it's it's a

418
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:27,759
greater mistake than even when they you

419
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:29,720
know when they were blood letting even

420
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:31,279
when they were blood letting even when

421
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:33,040
they you know when poor George

422
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:34,600
Washington first president of the United

423
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,240
States was blood leted to death over a

424
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:39,800
sore throat okay I mean that was a

425
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:42,680
horrific mistake without a doubt but

426
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:45,920
this mistake here is affecting millions

427
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:47,839
of people millions of people so what

428
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:50,240
happens is Epstein bar enters into

429
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,720
thyroid slowly over time and some people

430
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,680
it happens faster depending on their

431
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:55,360
immune system deficiencies and how much

432
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,560
heavy metals they have in the body and

433
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,839
what kind of foods they're eating and

434
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:03,199
what kind of stress they're under it

435
00:16:58,839 --> 00:17:05,120
Burrows into the thyroid causing

436
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:08,160
hypothyroidism okay so that's what it

437
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:10,679
does and it can do a few other things in

438
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:13,919
some people's body bodies um the the

439
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:17,520
immune system okay tries to take calcium

440
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:20,160
and protect you and wall off the virus

441
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:22,919
and you might get a nodule that's from

442
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,919
calcium being make these little calcium

443
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:27,880
prisons being built around the Epstein

444
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:29,000
bar to stop it and that doesn't hurt us

445
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,480
at all

446
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,160
and it's there to stop the Epstein bar

447
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:34,360
when your Epstein bar gets better and

448
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,080
your thyroid is getting better and you

449
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:38,280
do things to do to take care of yourself

450
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,720
like I've seen hundreds do and get rid

451
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:41,640
of their Hashimoto and their and their

452
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:45,280
hypothyroidism and their nodules those

453
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:46,960
nodules go down and clear up and um

454
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,760
sometimes they Le leave a little bit of

455
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,919
a little Scar Tissue behind or something

456
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:53,880
like that but they can clear up there's

457
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:55,320
no question now since research and

458
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:57,880
science doesn't know what's wrong with

459
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:59,520
you the best way the best out is to say

460
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:01,400
you have H otus thyroiditis and your

461
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,520
body's attacking itself that's the best

462
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:06,039
out because you have they have to put

463
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:07,480
the blame on you not the doctor the

464
00:18:06,039 --> 00:18:09,520
doctor's not putting blame on you

465
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:11,720
doctors are you know all doctors are

466
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,799
good good people they go into the

467
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:16,120
industry to help people I know some

468
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:19,120
amazing doctors in fact without them we

469
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:22,000
wouldn't even have Epstein bar on the

470
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,640
radar Epstein bar it was named after two

471
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,200
doctors that discovered it now if they

472
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,880
didn't Discover It Spirit would have

473
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,760
just you know would call it a different

474
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,799
name of a virus is what's Spirit would

475
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:32,760
have done if it was discovered just like

476
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:35,240
some of the viruses that Spirit does see

477
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:37,480
now that we don't have names or tags for

478
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:39,440
that when we do scan spirit and I do a

479
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,880
scan we see different viruses in people

480
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,559
that have no names they're not even

481
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,480
discovered by research and science but

482
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:47,120
Epstein bar was and by two brilliant

483
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:49,720
Physicians they were

484
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:53,320
underfunded so the whole point is is

485
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:55,760
that it was discovered and that virus is

486
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:58,679
responsible for Hashimoto thyroiditis

487
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:00,240
and the best way to get kind of past all

488
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:01,600
that for the industry is is to blame it

489
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,440
on you it's autoimmune your body's

490
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:08,480
destroying itself so this is just so

491
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:10,039
important for you to know it really is

492
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,600
now let's talk about some things let's

493
00:19:10,039 --> 00:19:13,799
talk about symptoms mysterious weight

494
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:16,679
gain hair loss fatigue brain fog hot

495
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:19,039

496
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:21,640
insomnia impaired memory depression

497
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:23,159
menopause symptoms anxiety dizziness

498
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:25,200
those are Epstein bar symptoms not

499
00:19:23,159 --> 00:19:29,320
thyroid problem symptoms they get

500
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:32,320
classified as thyroid condition symptoms

501
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:34,320
by practitioners that have no clue It's

502
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:37,159
Perfectly Normal rightfully so that

503
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:39,159
Epstein bar is causing those symptoms so

504
00:19:37,159 --> 00:19:41,880
that's another mistake we have on the

505
00:19:39,159 --> 00:19:45,080
Block the only real symptoms you can get

506
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:49,799
from a thyroid problem are just very

507
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:52,000
mild fatigue at best and temperature

508
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:55,440
fluctuations temperature

509
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,640
fluctuations that's at best with a

510
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,240
thyroid symptom the symptoms people

511
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:01,120
experience that are being blamed on

512
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:03,559
thyroid right now by the best functional

513
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:06,679
doctors and everything else those are

514
00:20:03,559 --> 00:20:08,480
Epstein bar the fatigue is Epstein bar

515
00:20:06,679 --> 00:20:10,640
the heavy fatigue the brain fog is

516
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:13,039

because I want to make sure we get what

543
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:14,279

to the metal here all right these

547
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:25,520
symptoms are all Epstein bar related

548
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:28,279
symptoms blamed on the

549
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:30,960
thyroid yes there's thyroid problems and

550
00:21:28,279 --> 00:21:33,240
we see it in thyroid testing even though

551
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:37,159
thyroid testing is

552
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:39,840
Antiquated it's antique it's Antiquity

553
00:21:37,159 --> 00:21:41,720
there's no doubt someone told me you

554
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,520
know where I got the antique thing

555
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:45,000
someone told me like a while back they

556
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:47,159
said I'm totally the ant into

557
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,120
Antiquities that's what they said to me

558
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:50,600
right and you know and and I think

559
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,360
that's really cool cuz things from the

560
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:54,400
past is really cool so I was like hey

561
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:56,240
that sounds great you know um I like all

562
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,799
that and you're like you know um do you

563
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,919
know anything about antiques that's what

564
00:21:57,799 --> 00:22:03,720
this person said to me and and I said I

565
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:05,840
you know I mean Spirit knows all my

566
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:07,559
information in life comes from Spirit so

567
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,120
it all all comes from Spirit there's

568
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:11,240
really nothing I've kind of been able to

569
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:13,559
learn on my own I've just had to learn

570
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:16,159
everything from Spirit in my own life

571
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:17,760
and like oh I do know something about

572
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:19,279
antiques from what Spirit has taught me

573
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:22,559
about all kinds of different things but

574
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:23,840
I'm not a you know expert and uh and

575
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:25,600
person said well do you you know what do

576
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,279
you know that's about antique and I said

577
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,279
well how about whoa and it hit me how

578
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:32,000
about the uh outdated information that

579
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:33,960
gets put out fresh every day how about

580
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
the the information on Hashimoto

581
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:40,520
thyroiditis that's in the top thyroid

582
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:42,000
books literally is is ancient history if

583
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:44,000
if they don't realize the body doesn't

584
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,679
attack itself and EP bar is causing the

585
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,000
thyroid and you know literally ancient

586
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:51,039
history anything coming out brand new

587
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,919
about autoimmune ancient history that's

588
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:57,440
an antique already coming off fresh off

589
00:22:53,919 --> 00:23:00,039
the press okay I just for warning you

590
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:02,480
guys is is what I'm doing by the way so

591
00:23:00,039 --> 00:23:04,400
you don't so you don't get fooled that

592
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,080
your body's attacking itself the last

593
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,840
thing I ever want you to do is think

594
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:11,279
that cuz it's disastrous so those are

595
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:12,960
the Antiques that I'm seeing and that's

596
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:15,000
why I talk about that a little bit more

597
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:18,039
because it really really triggered that

598
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,640
into that area so let's talk about how

599
00:23:18,039 --> 00:23:22,600
the thyroid Works a little bit thyroid

600
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,760
produces some hormones it produces you

601
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:26,200
know thyroxin and and and that's what it

602
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:30,159
does it produces hormones it gets

603
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:31,559
signals by T TSH from the pituitary um

604
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:33,080
pretty straightforward research and

605
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:34,279
science actually has that down and

606
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:36,440
that's what's great about research and

607
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:38,360
science because they do have pieces to

608
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:40,440
the puzzle thank God and when it comes

609
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:41,919
to you know heart surgery and it comes

610
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:44,120
to those kinds of things and when you

611
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:46,120
break a leg there I mean you need them

612
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:48,559
car accidents you need them when it

613
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:50,600
comes to chronic illness they fall short

614
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:52,039
it's simple as that it's that's that's

615
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,600
that's where we're at right now and

616
00:23:52,039 --> 00:23:55,640
human history with with science and

617
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:58,480
research in medical in the medical world

618
00:23:55,640 --> 00:24:02,080
so okay so you know we know how that

619
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:05,000
works with the thyroid that part okay so

620
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:08,360
that does work like that but testing for

621
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,440
thyroids is still outdated and

622
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:14,120
Antiquated when you go to the doctor's

623
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:15,559
office and you get some blood drawn and

624
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:18,000
you know your numbers are there they

625
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:19,840
show your numbers um and you know

626
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,480
thyroid profile and the doctor says well

627
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:25,480
you have this or that or you have no

628
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:27,399
problem it's really not easy to to know

629
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:29,840
because the minute you go to the

630
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:31,440
doctor's office your adrenaline is

631
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,320
running a little bit even if the

632
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:37,039
doctor's office is the most favorite

633
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:39,159
place on in your life to go like you

634
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:40,960
know say it's even like meditation some

635
00:24:39,159 --> 00:24:44,159
people say I just love my doctor visits

636
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:45,679
because I love my doctor and um so even

637
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:47,799
if you're in that state but the minute

638
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:50,399
you get a blood test the minute the

639
00:24:47,799 --> 00:24:53,799
needle goes into your

640
00:24:50,399 --> 00:24:57,279
arm okay the minute it goes

641
00:24:53,799 --> 00:25:00,120
in Adrenaline fires off the adrenals

642
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:02,399
pump they pump ferociously even if even

643
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:04,919
if it's for 10 minutes or five minutes

644
00:25:02,399 --> 00:25:08,640
they pump ferociously and that

645
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:11,640
adrenaline confuses and cancels out TSH

646
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:14,240
readings thyroxin readings you T3 T4 you

647
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:18,080
name it all the testing that we have

648
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:21,880
today gets boner totally boner from that

649
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:24,880
alone Disturbed from that alone now you

650
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:29,600
would have to get a blood test once a

651
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:33,039
day for 30 days and then the average

652
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:34,080
number be taken from all 30 days to give

653
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:36,760
you an

654
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:39,399
idea of a closer

655
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:40,960
number number one and even that's not

656
00:25:39,399 --> 00:25:43,600
going to secure us because the

657
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:47,679
adrenaline ran all 30 days when you got

658
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:49,399
the blood test let see how it works and

659
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:51,120
and this is this is one of the problems

660
00:25:49,399 --> 00:25:53,960
we have with blood test it's one of the

661
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:55,679
reasons why a so many people have a

662
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:57,880
hypothyroid problem or or they have

663
00:25:55,679 --> 00:26:00,320
hypothyroidism and it doesn't come up on

664
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:01,799
the tests but they have Epstein bar and

665
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,559
all the Epstein bar symptoms and they

666
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:05,240
have all the thyroid related Epstein bar

667
00:26:03,559 --> 00:26:07,000
symptoms and it doesn't come up on the

668
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:09,039
test they got the temperature

669
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,039
fluctuations they got the basic thyroid

670
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:12,399
symptoms and then they have all the

671
00:26:10,039 --> 00:26:13,799
Epstein bar symptoms I was talking about

672
00:26:12,399 --> 00:26:16,559
and it doesn't come up and they're told

673
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:18,480
it's all in their head or you know go go

674
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:20,399
somewhere or head to a lime doctor and

675
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:23,120
get a fake diagn get a false diagnosis

676
00:26:20,399 --> 00:26:25,080
of Lyme disease so because those blood

677
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:27,919
blood blood tests don't work either

678
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:29,600
those are really insufficient too from

679
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:32,440
the best Labs I talked about that in the

680
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:33,880
lime La the lime show about lime labs

681
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:35,120
and blood works so I talked about that

682
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:37,159
you should you should listen to that

683
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,640
show again someday if you guys ever you

684
00:26:37,159 --> 00:26:40,360
know if you've missed it maybe this is

685
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,320
the first time hearing any of my my

686
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:45,279
shows and so you got to check that one

687
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:47,880
out so what happens is there's an

688
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:51,440
inconsistency with blood testing all on

689
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:54,080
its own all on its own and this is a big

690
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:57,399
problem with blood tests and how it

691
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:59,600
works um so let's go into a couple of

692
00:26:57,399 --> 00:27:03,600
things things that are really

693
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:06,279
important and um one is thyroid

694
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:08,360
medication so I'm sure you guys are

695
00:27:06,279 --> 00:27:11,760
curious in this department thyroid

696
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:15,640
medication now thyroid

697
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:18,480
medication um isn't prescribed to fix

698
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:19,840
the problem so it's not prescribed to

699
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:23,000
fix the problem

700
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:26,440
because no one knows the thyroid is

701
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:29,120
inflamed from Epstein bar originally

702
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:32,080
they just go by the numbers you know

703
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:35,159
thyroxin is not being produced um is

704
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:37,840
being under produced TSH is being

705
00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:40,960
overproduced so then thyroid medication

706
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:44,760
is prescribed so your TSH comes

707
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:47,320
down and um and so that's the game but

708
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:50,039
really it has nothing to do with fixing

709
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:52,480
you or your thyroid technically your

710
00:27:50,039 --> 00:27:56,159
thyroid still hypo or hashimotos

711
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:59,360
thyroiditis it's still hypo or has

712
00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:01,679
thyroiditis that can't change unless

713
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:03,640
someone wakes up someday and says wait a

714
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:05,960
minute you got a viral condition to your

715
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:07,360
thyroid we have to address it we have to

716
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,799
kill off the viral condition we have to

717
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,399
clean it out of the thyroid we have to

718
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:13,240
recover the thyroid we have to restore

719
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:14,919
the thyroid and until that happens which

720
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:16,320
is not happening anywhere else it's not

721
00:28:14,919 --> 00:28:18,159
happening in other books I've seen it's

722
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,440
not happening in anything else going on

723
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:21,799
until that

724
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,200
happens then we're going to fix our

725
00:28:21,799 --> 00:28:25,399
Hashimoto then we're going to fix our

726
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,960
thyroiditis then we're going to fix her

727
00:28:25,399 --> 00:28:28,679
hypothyroidism and then we're going to

728
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,760
fix her hyp hyperthyroidism which I'm

729
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:34,600
going to talk about in a little while

730
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:37,440
too this is why I'm speedy speedy today

731
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:39,200
because um there's so much to talk about

732
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,720
so you're given you're given a

733
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,519
medication the medication you think you

734
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:45,440
you're fixing your thyroid you walk out

735
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:47,399
of the doctor's office and your thyroid

736
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,559
continues to worsen over the years cuz

737
00:28:47,399 --> 00:28:52,080
no one ever got the Epstein bar

738
00:28:49,559 --> 00:28:53,600
out and a lot of people get worse when

739
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:56,159
they take a thyroid medication because

740
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:57,840
it's a steroid and when it's a steroid

741
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:00,200
some people react to it so they can't

742
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:02,720
take a thyroid medication steroids tend

743
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:04,399
to make viral conditions worse so they

744
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,919
end up getting more heart palpitations

745
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:07,840
more symptoms and then there's a small

746
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:09,840
crew people that can handle a steroid an

747
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:12,360
additional steroid in fact it actually

748
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:15,360
helps suppress symptoms too it

749
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:17,120
suppresses some symptoms in people with

750
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,080
Epstein bar related symptoms because

751
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:20,559
it's a

752
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:22,039
steroid and you know and they're not

753
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:23,279
they're it's suppressing symptoms even

754
00:29:22,039 --> 00:29:24,720
though the epscene bar could be getting

755
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:26,000
worse but the symptoms are being

756
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:28,440
suppressed because they're not as

757
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,080
sensitive of people there's some people

758
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:32,240
hyp sensitive that can't handle that

759
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:36,159
kind of steroid and they instantly start

760
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:38,120
reacting now so thyroid medication I'm

761
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:40,559
not saying you you don't you don't have

762
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:42,640
to take it or whatever it's a Band-Aid

763
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:44,480
the the deal is where you want to go

764
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,880
with it all is you want to work on the

765
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,919
problem itself even when you're taking

766
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:49,799
your thyroid medication so that someday

767
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:51,880
you can talk to your doctor and ask your

768
00:29:49,799 --> 00:29:53,679
doctor to help wean you off and see

769
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:55,960
where your numbers are again even though

770
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:58,000
it's difficulty to even get the right

771
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:59,440
number when your adrenaline's pumping

772
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,039
you know it's like white coat fever you

773
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,399
go to the doctor and your high blood

774
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:04,600
pressure goes I mean your blood pressure

775
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:07,039
goes up and start to go high I know

776
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:08,360
hundreds of people who go to the doctor

777
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:10,399
and they and they all of a sudden look

778
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:13,039
like they have hypertension they go home

779
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:14,679
and it's gone it's White Coat Syndrome

780
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:16,279
every and that happens when you get the

781
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:18,440
needle in your arm it's like kind of

782
00:30:16,279 --> 00:30:20,039
White Coat Syndrome the needle goes in

783
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:21,440
and the adrenaline pumps and it cancels

784
00:30:20,039 --> 00:30:23,960
out the blood test so we don't get

785
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:25,720
accurac full accuracy blood tests but we

786
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:27,519
have to go by whatever blood we can and

787
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:29,399
whatever blood test we can regard this

788
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:31,960
is some kind of background because we

789
00:30:29,399 --> 00:30:33,320
got no other choice the bottom line is

790
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,480
you go to the doctor and you talk about

791
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:37,559
weaning

792
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:39,360
off weaning off and and um the

793
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:41,760
medications with your doctor's

794
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:43,679
permission and him you know him being

795
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,600
supportive and her being

796
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:48,000
supportive if you're working on

797
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,960
recovering your thyroid if you're

798
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,279
working on recovering your thyroid and

799
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,559
so when you're doing you know taking

800
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:54,399
action and that's what we're talking

801
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:55,559
about today so that's an option for you

802
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:57,320
you can also keep your thyroid

803
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:59,200
medication going and still recover your

804
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:01,600
thyroid and work on your your thyroid

805
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:03,080
and still do that that's something too

806
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,559
but talking to your doctor is always a

807
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:06,919
great thing no matter what when it comes

808
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:09,159
down to that now here's the

809
00:31:06,919 --> 00:31:10,960
deal um

810
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:13,440
hyperthyroidism let's talk about that

811
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:15,679
for a little bit hyperthyroidism is

812
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:17,320
Epstein bar there's over 60 varieties of

813
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:19,120
Epstein bar I talk about that in the

814
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:22,440
medical medium book you guys probably

815
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:25,039
have read it and seen it um but 60

816
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:26,440
varieties of of of Epstein bar some of

817
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:27,679
them are a little bit more aggressive to

818
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:30,960
the thyroid

819
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:32,000
and they get into the thyroid and they

820
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:35,679
because they're a little bit more

821
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:39,200
aggressive the thyroid produces cells

822
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:40,039
not to attack itself in fact far from it

823
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:43,440
it

824
00:31:40,039 --> 00:31:46,080
produces tissue thyroid tissue and

825
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,919
cells because the the Epstein bar is

826
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:50,240
being so aggressive see so it's the

827
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:52,720
Epstein bar attacking the thyroid not

828
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:54,440
the body and this what this does it

829
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,320
sends the opposite direction going on

830
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:58,200
and it sends you into the hyperthyroid

831
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:00,120
thyroidism play place that piece of

832
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:03,799
information doesn't exist anywhere else

833
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:07,639
but here um once again I've been saying

834
00:32:03,799 --> 00:32:09,639
that like I said so that you don't fall

835
00:32:07,639 --> 00:32:11,639
in you know for something else that's

836
00:32:09,639 --> 00:32:13,720
not going to get you better so for

837
00:32:11,639 --> 00:32:16,559
hyperthyroidism it's still Epstein bar

838
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:18,320
related now um it's one thing to

839
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:19,919
understand and you can heal

840
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:21,919
hyperthyroidism and then there's some

841
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:23,880
people who have um two varieties of

842
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:25,880
Epstein bar three varieties of Epstein

843
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:27,480
bar you can pick them up along the way

844
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:29,240
you can get them when you're a child you

845
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:31,080
can get them from your mom and dad you

846
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:33,120
can have them in your system you can get

847
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:35,279
them from your first boyfriend first

848
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:37,480
girlfriend you can get them in college

849
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:39,519
you can get them you know down the line

850
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:41,200
and that we can collect a few you can

851
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:42,799
get them in a restaurant when you know a

852
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:45,600
chef Cuts their finger because it

853
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:49,039
happens all the time and you just you

854
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:51,360
just get them and when you have more

855
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:53,120
than one when you have an you some

856
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:55,679
people have two and they'll be both in

857
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:58,080
the thyroid and one will be creating

858
00:32:55,679 --> 00:33:01,320
hypothyroid one will be creating hyper

859
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:02,840
that's just how it works um now let's

860
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:05,360
talk about something that's interesting

861
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:08,080
if you had thyroid

862
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:11,000
cancer that's a variety of Epstein bar

863
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:13,240
that specifically causes thyroid cancer

864
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,080
Epstein bar creates breast cancer uh

865
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:16,720
causes breast cancer I'm the first one

866
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:19,679
ever to bring that information into the

867
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:22,080
world and it's finally being researched

868
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:25,159
um and talked about a little bit and

869
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:27,159
then you know as far as the thyroid goes

870
00:33:25,159 --> 00:33:30,159
thyroid cancer that's caused by Epstein

871
00:33:27,159 --> 00:33:32,679
as well um you know we have an epidemic

872
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:34,799
of Epstein bar and I call it an epic

873
00:33:32,679 --> 00:33:38,440
demic because it's really that epic at

874
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:40,880
this point in a bad way but the bottom

875
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:45,039
line is if you had thyroid cancer and

876
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:46,760
you had your thyroid removed um there's

877
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:49,399
it there's still a lot of positives with

878
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:51,760
that a lot of positives um I'm bringing

879
00:33:49,399 --> 00:33:54,000
to light for the first time about how

880
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:56,600
positive it is if you did you know lose

881
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:59,480
your thyroid it's not a negative thing

882
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:02,080
because you can't get rid of all your

883
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:03,880
thyroid the best surgeon can't remove

884
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:06,159
your whole thyroid I was even talking to

885
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:07,480
Dr Christian northr about this when um

886
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:09,639
when you know I was talking to her

887
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:11,240
recently and both of us were talking

888
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:12,839
about that because she you know she's a

889
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:15,159
an amazing doctor one of the best

890
00:34:12,839 --> 00:34:18,040
actually out there that I've ever met

891
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:21,399
ever and um and she said no you you

892
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:26,280
can't get all of that thyroid

893
00:34:21,399 --> 00:34:28,399
removed um it's not possible and so so

894
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:32,560
lot of tissue gets left behind could be

895
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:35,079
even 1% could be 2% could be 3% that

896
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:37,560
tissue produces thyroxin and it also

897
00:34:35,079 --> 00:34:40,440
tells the body you still have a thyroid

898
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:43,040
regardless see so anyone who has had

899
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:46,000
their thyroid removed understand that

900
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:49,079
you your body believes you have a

901
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:52,359
thyroid it does you should kind of go

902
00:34:49,079 --> 00:34:54,760
along with that and tell your body hey I

903
00:34:52,359 --> 00:34:56,599
do have a thyroid it's not missing you

904
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,920
believe I don't meaning to your body

905
00:34:56,599 --> 00:35:01,200
your body doesn't believe you know

906
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:03,000
that's missing so so you you know that

907
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:05,320
the body thinks you have a thyroid you

908
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,839
have to go along with that it's

909
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:10,079
important because why because your

910
00:35:06,839 --> 00:35:13,079
body's picking up traces of thyroxin

911
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:16,480
traces of thyroxin that's what the

912
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:19,040
body's picking up and and it it knows it

913
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:20,760
knows something so and same thing if you

914
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:23,000
if you had radioactive iodine and just

915
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:25,040
you know the radioactive the radioactive

916
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,000
iodine treatment that kills off your

917
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,560
thyroid wears off after a while and you

918
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,200
start getting your thyroid back always

919
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:32,599
remember that and it never kills off the

920
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:34,320
thyroid completely it's another thing

921
00:35:32,599 --> 00:35:37,599
another thing that's so critical you

922
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:39,280
guys critical to know and you can bring

923
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:41,160
back your thyroid after you know having

924
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:44,040
it killed off from Radioactive radio

925
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:47,560
iDine treatments so you can you can

926
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:50,440
actually have your thyroid come back now

927
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:51,640
iodine let's talk about that iodine

928
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:55,800
kills

929
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:58,160
off viruses it's an antiseptic

930
00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:02,680
antibacterial and anti antiviral when

931
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:04,319
you were being told not to use iodine

932
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:07,680
when you have hashimotos thyroiditis

933
00:36:04,319 --> 00:36:11,760
another incredible mistake okay now you

934
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:13,760
don't want to be iodine deficient with

935
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:15,280
Hashimoto because it can end up into a

936
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,640
thyroid cancer case down the road for

937
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:19,560
some people who have the variety that

938
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:20,920
causes it and you just don't want an

939
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:23,400
iodine

940
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:25,160
deficiency because that allows Epstein

941
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:27,000
bar to thrive in the body now you don't

942
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:28,839
want to have to take a lot of I you

943
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,200
don't have to at all if you think you've

944
00:36:28,839 --> 00:36:31,400
been iodine deficient you can talk to

945
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:35,280
your practitioner and take a little bit

946
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:36,760
of iodine but I I like also having like

947
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:39,119
just a little bit of seaweed a little

948
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:43,480
bit of kelp in your diet once in a while

949
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:47,359
some spirulina Hawaiian spirulina um

950
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:49,160
dols is the best one so DOL uh Atlantic

951
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:51,200
Sea Atlantic Sea vegetables and they

952
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:52,800
sell dos and you get a little dos in

953
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:54,960
your diet if you want you can get a high

954
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:56,760
quality inent iodine and take one or two

955
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,599
tiny drops or three drops or you you

956
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:01,200
know you can take even more if you don't

957
00:36:58,599 --> 00:37:02,920
feel like you're reacting at all you can

958
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:05,119
take a little bit more if you feel like

959
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:07,079
you're reacting that's the virus

960
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:09,280
reacting because the virus doesn't like

961
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:12,280
the iodine it's why they even you they

962
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:14,960
don't here's the thing they found that

963
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:16,319
radioactive iodine kills off the thyroid

964
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:18,800
but they don't know what's happening

965
00:37:16,319 --> 00:37:20,400
they just they just think it's killing

966
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:23,920
off the thyroid but what it's doing is

967
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:25,920
it's knocking down the viral

968
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:27,640
condition and research and science

969
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,400
doesn't know that part yet they just

970
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:31,319
know that something changes with the

971
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:33,040
thyroid when they use radioactive iodine

972
00:37:31,319 --> 00:37:36,040
I don't recommend it I don't recommend

973
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:38,640
the treatment there's other ways to

974
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:41,119
actually get rid of your Epstein bar and

975
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:42,440
and head in the right direction and if

976
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:44,240
you've had it if if you had the

977
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:45,680
radioactive iodine treatment and you've

978
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:48,079
been told your thyroids been killed off

979
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:49,760
it's not killed off and much of it's

980
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:51,280
alive and functioning and it and it

981
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:53,560
recharges especially if you do all the

982
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:55,319
right things you take care of yourself

983
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:56,960
and you eat right and everything and

984
00:37:55,319 --> 00:37:58,680
things start getting better and we start

985
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,560
knocking down the Epstein bar virus and

986
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:02,400
things start getting better and it

987
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:05,240
really helps now I want to make sure I

988
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:07,440

1079
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:42,599
bad it is and why it's bad it's

1080
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:45,560
different than eating a piece of fish I

1081
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:47,400
promise you it's entirely different but

1082
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:49,640
um I saw a commercial the other day on

1083
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:51,359
television where you know a doctor was

1084
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:52,960
recommending some kind of brand of fish

1085
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:55,640
oil and it was just first of all it was

1086
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:58,200
just bad fish oil and um it wasn't even

1087
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:59,880
good fish oil second of all it was just

1088
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:01,520
terrifying for someone who has epsteen

1089
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:03,119
bar someone who has brain problems

00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:48,240
micro greens that are like kale and

1156
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:51,480
broccoli Sprouts all these are critical

1157
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:53,599
for your thyroid um the F fads and

1158
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:55,359
transs out there which I talk about in

1159
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:57,640
the books and I even mention it again in

1160
00:44:55,359 --> 00:45:00,880
life-changing foods but I go more deeper

1161
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:02,599
into it actually um it's a bad Trend

1162
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:04,599
where there was a mistake made where

1163
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:07,960
these these Cogen compounds cogenic

1164
00:45:04,599 --> 00:45:11,280
compounds that disarm the thyroid make

1165
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:13,720
it hypo this is inaccurate the same

1166
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:17,200
vegetables like kale have an anti- gorog

1167
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:19,400
genic compound anti- gorog genic um

1168
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:21,599
compound that shuts down the gorog genic

1169
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:24,920
compound that's number one you couldn't

1170
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:27,160
even eat a 100 pound barrel of broccoli

1171
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:32,400
and if you did it wouldn't hurt the

1172
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:35,000
thyroid so instead antiseptic antiviral

1173
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:36,400
foods that help knock out epine bar out

1174
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:39,160
of the body and out of the thyroid that

1175
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:41,359
help rejuvenate the thyroid sulfur are

1176
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:43,240
in these vegetables that help restore

1177
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:45,880
the thyroid and slow down the Epstein

1178
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:48,359
bar kale can help bring your thyroid

1179
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:52,200
back so this is an

1180
00:45:48,359 --> 00:45:55,319
example of what's going wrong out there

1181
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:57,599
example you know and it's unbelievable

1182
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:59,599
but this is this is how bad it is I mean

1183
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:01,480
there's times where I'm doing like a

1184
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:03,000
show somewhere or a summit somewhere or

1185
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:04,920

1186
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,640
speakers in there like you know whatever

1187
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:07,880
just tons of speakers and someone else

1188
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:10,200

1189
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:12,520
your thyroid without knowing any

1190
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:15,640

1203
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:59,520
Trends oh spinach isad fad it's got ayc

1204
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:01,559
acid in it it's it's you know oxalates

1205
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:06,040
you know the whole bit and that's not

1206
00:47:01,559 --> 00:47:08,319
true raw spinach raw spinach like raw

1207
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:11,079
spinach in a

1208
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:13,200
salad actually doesn't do that it

1209
00:47:11,079 --> 00:47:16,559
doesn't have that in it it's when you

1210
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:17,960
cook spinach then that's when it shifts

1211
00:47:16,559 --> 00:47:19,640
and turns into something you kind of

1212
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:21,520
don't want you can cook other things you

1213
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:23,319
can cook other greens if you want but

1214
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:24,720
you don't want to cook spinach because

1215
00:47:23,319 --> 00:47:27,720
that changes the structure of the

1216
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:30,119
spinach and you know and that oxyc acid

1217
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:32,079
could become annoying but that's only in

1218
00:47:30,119 --> 00:47:34,520
cooked and then they have it flipped

1219
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:35,960
everybody out there has it flipped they

1220
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:37,960
have it when you you're saying you can't

1221
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:40,400

00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:33,240
but here's what I'm for mainly is what's

1269
00:49:31,559 --> 00:49:34,839
going to fix your Hashimoto if you don't

1270
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:36,440
have Hashimoto if you don't have

1271
00:49:34,839 --> 00:49:38,440
hyperthyroidism if you didn't have

1272
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:40,040
thyroid cancer if you're not missing a

1273
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:41,319
thyroid if you didn't have all these

1274
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:43,200
things going on if you're not having

1275
00:49:41,319 --> 00:49:45,520
thyroid symptoms or abene bar related

1276
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:47,920
thyroid symptoms then I would say yeah

1277
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:50,040
you can have probably you know um you

1278
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:53,440
know whatever every day or this than

1279
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:55,640
that or an animal protein or even an egg

1280
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:58,079
I probably would say you can have an egg

1281
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:59,680
if your heart's content once in a while

1282
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:03,480
but I still don't like eggs because they

1283
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:06,160
grow PCOS cysts tumors fibroids breast

1284
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:08,319
cancer uh which is epine bar and eggs

1285
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:10,280
just feed and feed everything so maybe I

1286
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:13,359
take that one back don't eat an egg okay

1287
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:17,799
the bottom line is stay away from also

1288
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:19,880
canola oil stay away from corn corn stay

1289
00:50:17,799 --> 00:50:22,480
away from corn and canola oil when it

1290
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:24,440
comes down to Hashimoto so here it is

1291
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:26,079
information out there stay here's the

1292
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:28,880
information that's missing leading

1293
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:31,640
that's out there I'm going to recap it

1294
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:34,160
they say stay away from uh you know

1295
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:35,680
foods like and this is just some of the

1296
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:37,160
foods they're actually putting in the

1297
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:39,520
category that are all wrong they're

1298
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:43,480
saying kale collard greens cauliflower

1299
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:45,559
broccoli wrong totally wrong you guys

1300
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:47,400
okay here's another misleading mistake

1301
00:50:45,559 --> 00:50:49,480
stay away from seaweed with a thyroid

1302
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:52,160
problem now that's another one that's

1303
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:54,559
developing right there that alone

1304
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:56,880
another mistake your body's attacking

1305
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:58,920
itself when you have aimoto incredible

1306
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:01,880
mistake one of the greatest of all time

1307
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:06,119
in medical history I mean greatest of

1308
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:08,280
all time okay and you know and there's

1309
00:51:06,119 --> 00:51:09,960
more okay and then you know and young

1310
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:12,079
people now they think they created their

1311
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:14,440
own problems all the time so when a

1312
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:17,599
22-year-old woman you know gets told

1313
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:19,200
they have Hashimoto Modo they they get

1314
00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:21,839
they they hear that they probably

1315
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:24,119
manifested it that's not true either you

1316
00:51:21,839 --> 00:51:25,480
didn't manifest it you didn't create it

1317
00:51:24,119 --> 00:51:26,880
you know Millennials are being told

1318
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:29,040
they're creating all their problems now

1319
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:31,599
with their illnesses it doesn't work

1320
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:34,040
like that I like using manifestation I

1321
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:36,960
like manifesting positive things I like

1322
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:39,880
manifesting the future I like attracting

1323
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:42,079
good things but it can't be used against

1324
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:44,040
you in a way that makes you feel like

1325
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:46,200
you got a disease cuz you manifested or

1326
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:48,160
you attracted it that's a great mistake

1327
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:50,680
that's occurring right now in our young

1328
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:53,440
people and in our older people whatever

1329
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:55,079
it's happening both ways so just be

1330
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:59,079
careful there you're a good person you

1331
00:51:55,079 --> 00:52:00,799
didn't cause the problem and so overall

1332
00:51:59,079 --> 00:52:02,359
just go back a little bit your body's

1333
00:52:00,799 --> 00:52:05,079
not attacking itself Hashimoto

1334
00:52:02,359 --> 00:52:06,640
thyroiditis is caused by Epstein bar if

1335
00:52:05,079 --> 00:52:08,920
you had your thyroid removed for some

1336
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:10,640
reason like cancer or anything else um

1337
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:11,960
that's okay you have tissue left that

1338
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:13,520
you didn't even know producing some

1339
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:15,520
thyroxin so your body believes you have

1340
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:17,000
a thyroid make sure you're not iodine

1341
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:18,160
deficient completely so make sure you

1342
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,359
have a little bit of seaweed or some

1343
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:23,359
spirita in there so you have some iodine

1344
00:52:20,359 --> 00:52:25,440
meaning you know on that level okay look

1345
00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:27,480
into some of these supplements all right

1346
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:29,680
I I list these in places on like on my

1347
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:32,400
website so people have an easy access so

1348
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:34,160
they're not lost think about these Foods

1349
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:35,960
stay away from cultivated blueberries

1350
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:37,200
because they really don't offer much and

1351
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:39,079
if you're going to pay that kind of

1352
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:40,920
price for a cultivated blueberry you're

1353
00:52:39,079 --> 00:52:42,559
wasting your money go to the freezer

1354
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:45,599
section and get the Frozen wild

1355
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:47,720
blueberry it's a medicine for God's sake

1356
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:49,760
it's a medicine most powerful one we

1357
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:51,960
have on the planet get your celery juice

1358
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:53,599
going get your asparagus in your diet

1359
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:55,960
every day if you can so your thyroid

1360
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:57,160
starts to improve when you go to the

1361
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:58,480
doctor's office realize your

1362
00:52:57,160 --> 00:53:00,559
adrenaline's running a little bit when

1363
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:02,839
you get a when you get a blood test so

1364
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:04,760
you might want to just relax and realize

1365
00:53:02,839 --> 00:53:07,280
that your test may not be as accurate as

1366
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:08,880
we want them to be but but just calm

1367
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:12,119
down calm the adrenaline down and it can

1368
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:14,240
help get a more accurate test so try to

1369
00:53:12,119 --> 00:53:16,599
kind of relax a little bit when you can

1370
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:18,400
at the doctor's office knowing that it's

1371
00:53:16,599 --> 00:53:20,040
okay it's okay if you get a blood test

1372
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:21,520
and we'll calm the adrenals down so

1373
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:25,000
maybe we can try to get a more accurate

1374
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:28,000
test all these things I want you to know

1375
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:30,760
and and consider and understand and you

1376
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:33,520
can heal you can reverse Hashimoto's

1377
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:35,040
I've seen it done hundreds of times and

1378
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:36,640
it's being done hundreds more and

1379
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:39,280
hundreds more just from the information

1380
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:40,880
that came from medical medium book so we

be disappointed if you're disappointed

1385

I'll probably be heartbroken because I

1386
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,520
killed myself making sure that thing was

1387
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:56,000
packed with getting information from

1388
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:58,040

00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,640

00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:08,160
this gift for me it wasn't given to me

1393
00:54:05,839 --> 00:54:10,359
for me that's not what happened when I

1394
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:13,119
was young I said to Spirit is this a

1395
00:54:10,359 --> 00:54:14,760
gift that's it's this is for me and and

1396
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:17,160
spirit said no this gift is for everyone

1397
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:19,720
else and I was heartbroken when I was

1398
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:22,160
young when I was little heartbroken and

1399
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:23,720
then as I got older I realized the gift

1400
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:26,079
is seeing you heal and get the

00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:28,480
