here we are

402
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,680
we're dealing with

403
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,360
a situation where someone's walking

404
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,440
around they got tinkles and numbness

405
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,120
they got aches and pains they got all

406
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,839
kinds of mystery symptoms maybe they got

407
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,680
dizziness maybe they got vertigo maybe

408
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,760
they got any they could have anything

409
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,839
going on that's neurological so why is

410
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,920
it happening people get the epstein-barr

411
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,760
virus it sits inside their liver

412
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,920
it feeds off of all kinds of toxins and

413
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,360
poisons like metals and all kinds of

414
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,040
petrochemicals and everything else that

415
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,560
get inside pharmaceuticals old

416
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:19,040
pharmaceuticals and that are sit inside

417
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,720
people's liver and then the virus

418
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,079
goes to the bathroom the virus

419
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,160
eliminates

420
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:27,040
it goes to bathroom

421
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:29,519
when the virus goes to bathroom

422
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:33,120
it's releasing poisons and toxins those

423
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:35,440
poisons and toxins float around the body

424
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,720
and inflamed nerves someone's walking

425
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,320
around with knee pain that's

426
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,920
unexplainable back pain that's

427
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:43,199
unexplainable jaw pain that's

428
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:45,440
unexplainable neck pain head pain

429
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,959
dizziness ringing in the ears all kinds

430
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,880
of different conditions what's happening

431
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:49,920
is those neurotoxins are floating around

432
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,000
the body

433
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,839
and inflaming nerves

434
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,240
so keep that in mind so neurological

435
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:58,000
symptoms are all those neurotoxins

436
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,360
floating around the body produced by

437
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,839
viruses

438
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,079
inflaming the nerves

439
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:05,839
so keep that in mind pamela says order

440
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:07,360
the book amazing i'm so glad i can't

441
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,880
wait for you to read it your mind's

442
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,839
going to get blown

443
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:13,839
okay

444
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:17,600
so the whole thing about neurological

445
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:20,079
symptoms is you have to be able to kill

446
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,839
viruses you have to be able to kill the

447
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:23,360
bugs creating them and getting the

448
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,360
poisons and toxins out or at least

449
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,880
killing the bugs so let's talk about

450
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:30,240
supplements and dosages and why that's

451
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:33,120
important okay so i'm going to put

that they upped the quality

527
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,440
in hopes that they up the quality and

528
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,360
vimrji went to that standard the highest

529
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,760

the cat's claw right there so what it

540
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,679
says in here for neurological symptoms

541
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,960
and ask your doctor what's right for you

542
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:39,360
but this is what i would do if i was

543
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:41,039

544
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,880

548
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:50,080

to do is i like to become friends with

550
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,720
supplement company owners out there

551
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,400

553
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,039

friendships blow up like i'm now like

555
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:04,320

anyway so we got that the cat's gone

565
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,679
right there

566
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:26,320
so now golden seal

567
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:27,760
golden seal is antibacterial it's

568
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:30,559
antiviral

569
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,919
i love it goldenseal is an important one

570
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:34,000
right there so when someone's dealing

571
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:36,559
with neurological symptoms chronic

572
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,320
fatigue is a neurological symptom all on

573
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:40,720
its own so that's the golden seal right

574
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,679
there it says one drop or full twice a

575
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,440
day

576
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:45,520
is what it says so that's one dropper

577
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,280
full and if you look if you want to do

578
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,520
instead of twice a day and this is what

579
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:51,200
i do like for friends and stuff i'll be

580
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:53,360
like look if you got to do two in one

00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,280
shot and you do you do your you know you

582
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:58,720
do it once a day then that's what you do

583
00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:02,080
right zinc is critical

584
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:04,400
for healing neurological symptoms zinc

585
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:07,280
is critical for healing

586
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:09,760
neurological conditions symptoms viral

587
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:12,080
issues pathogen issues zinc is critical

588
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:13,679
you guys on tick-tock it's so important

589
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,440
it really is and you guys aren't rubble

590
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,520
it's so important so what it says in

591
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,200
here it says zinc it says one drop or

592
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,039
full twice a day

593
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,799
of zinc now you might be like well i'll

594
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:24,159
just go get zinc somewhere yeah you

595
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,840
could do that but you'll probably get a

596
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:27,360
zinc that has citric acid in it you'll

597
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:30,480
probably get a zinc that has chemicals

598
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:32,720
in it i talk about this in the book

599
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,799
this is important to know okay when

600
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:37,280
you're in this book you read that

601
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:39,360

604
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:45,520

all right so we got the zinc right there

613
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:04,559
so that's important it's critical when

614
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:06,000
it comes down to the immune system

615
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,919
if you're sick

616
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,360
something went wrong with the immune

617
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:12,320
system

618
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:14,720
if you're sick with something

619
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:17,200
something went wrong with your immune

620
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:19,840
system if you're sick

621
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,039
if you got neurological symptoms

622
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:24,640
something

623
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:28,559
somewhere along the way in your life

624
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:31,039
went wrong with your immune system

625
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:34,159
if you're sick with two symptoms three

626
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:37,200
symptoms five symptoms 10 symptoms

627
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:38,880
50 symptoms

628
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,159
something went wrong with your immune

629
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,120
system

630
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:44,159
okay

631
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:45,360
that's why knowing protocols knowing

632
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:47,520
dosages

633
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:49,679
knowing what to do

634
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,200
is critical

635
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:52,880
that's why when you look in here and it

636
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,799

however my hair is so thin and lost so

676
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:26,559
much i'm devastated

677
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:29,200
the hair comes back for so many people

678
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:30,799
the whole thing millions of women are

679
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,880
losing their hair

680
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:34,559
i talk to doctors who focus on the keto

681
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,520
diet all their patients are losing their

682
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:37,280
hair

683
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:39,200
i talked to doctors on their vegan diets

684
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:41,520
doctors are focused on vegan diets and

685
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,039
they contact me and they said why why

686
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,960
what's with the hair thinning and all

687
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:46,320
their women are losing hair and their

688
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,720
pain their women patients are losing

689
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:51,039
their hair talk to paleo diet people

690
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,880
doctors that love the old paleo diet

691
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:54,880
they're all losing their hair animal

692
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:57,600
protein diets plant-based diets they're

693
00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:00,080
losing their hair the reason why

694
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:02,320
if you had caffeine in your life

695
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:04,400
there's a ticking time bomb that happens

696
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,520
later and the hair comes out for women

697
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,039
because women aren't supposed to lose

698
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,799
their hair women are never supposed to

699
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:10,720
lose a hair

700
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:13,200
and so if you're under stress and the

701
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,039
adrenals are overloaded from stress

702
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,960
right and you've got the caffeine

703
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:18,960
running and you got vinegar's another

704
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,960
one that doesn't help right

705
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:24,000
high fat diet all those years doesn't

706
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,799
help sluggish liver all these things add

707
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,400
up

708
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:28,159
all these things have intermittent

709
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,159
fasting the wrong way i've seen hair

710
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:31,760
fall out for people for that if someone

711
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:33,520
has a difficult experience a

712
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:35,039
relationship experience they have a

713
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:37,200
trying time with a relationship they

714
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:38,960
have a hardship the adrenals then lose

715
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,400
that that hormone they need because

716
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,480
that's i talk about the medical medium

717
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,480
books that your adrenal has to have all

718
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:48,880
set of hormones there's a specific

719
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:51,440
hormone to keep hair and follicles alive

720
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:53,200
okay so and basically what happens is

721
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:55,039
all these factors play a role the

722
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,559
caffeine is a big one and then the hair

723
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:58,080
comes out later

724
00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:00,400
so what i would do is just keep on

725
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:02,880
healing keep on doing all heal all the

726
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,960
all the critical stuff right

727
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:07,120
and then focus on maybe take take the

728
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:09,200
hair hair protocol doctor to you to the

729
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:11,200
hair protocol to your doctor here

730
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,440
and then and then work on that and guess

731
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,880
what on medical medium i've seen so many

732
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,240
women that lost their hair get their

733
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,760
hair back on medical medium where they

734
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,159
came to medical medium

735
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:21,919
with all their hair missing alopecia

736
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,600
thinning hair all of it and they got

737
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:25,679
their hair back

738
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,440
and so there's always hope so just just

739
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:29,520
know that there always is all right so

740
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,679
we're on neurological symptoms let's do

741
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:34,080
licorice root licorice fruit is critical

742
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:35,919
for neurological symptoms right

743
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,840
that's an important one

744
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:40,159

so

754
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:02,559

right now you guys we're talking about

832
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:30,880
protocol supplements

833
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:32,640
what to do dosages on protocols we're

834
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:35,440
talking about all of that

835
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,880
and here we are so thyroid conditions

836
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,240
true cause of thyroid conditions you

837
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,760
have to realize there's over 60

838
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:42,320
varieties of epstein-barr virus

839
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:44,559
epstein-barr enters into the thyroid

840
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:47,120
that's what it does very important to

841
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:47,120
know okay

842
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,600
epstein-barr

843
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,919
leaves the liver

844
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:56,080
after you've had mono

845
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:58,640
and it heads up to the thyroid at some

846
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:00,880
time in your life this is some of the

847
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,840
most important information you can ever

848
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,720
learn

849
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,880
because

850
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:08,320
everyone's getting diagnosed with a

851
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:10,320
thyroid condition and has no idea why so

852
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:12,320
how are they going to heal their thyroid

853
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:14,720
condition if they don't know why they

854
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:18,320
have a thyroid condition

855
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:19,760
did you ever think about that one right

856
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:22,720
epstein-barr

857
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:24,640
sits inside the liver

858
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,640
after you've had mononucleosis when

859
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:29,039
you're younger

860
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,720
it stays in there and eventually when

861
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:33,440
your immune system gets kicked down for

862
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:35,840
some reason like i said immune system

863
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:38,559
the epstein bar leaves the liver

864
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:41,039
and it heads up to your thyroid

865
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:42,720
it enters into the thyroid by burrowing

866
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:44,880
into the thyroid

867
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,960
and then it lives there where it creates

868
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:49,120
cysts and nodules

869
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:51,279
this is medical medium info that science

870
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:53,200
science is finally taking from me even

871
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:55,600
though it's not good because they take

872
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,799
it and they just mess it up and

873
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,240
and they don't cite back where the

874
00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:00,159
information they took from comes from

875
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,360
which is the mnm books the medical

876
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:03,039
textbooks

877
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,960
but you end up with epstein-barr in the

878
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:08,159
thyroid and then it does damage and you

879
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:10,080
get your hypothyroid every single person

880
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:12,240

881
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:14,559
hashimoto's or hyperthyroid or graves

882
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:16,240
disease or system nodules diagnosis in

883
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:20,080
their day

884
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:22,080
because of the viral epidemic causing it

885
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:25,679

929
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:54,640
that's a dropper full four dropper holes

930
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:57,039
let me get another one in here

931
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:58,840
all right we got that

932
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:00,720
okay that's important

933
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:03,200
spirulina you'll hear out there oh

934
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:05,600
spirulina for thyroid i don't know that

935
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,799
you know some people don't like oh yeah

936
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,240
yeah

937
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:09,919
that the whole thing

938
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:11,600
the reason why people don't get better

939
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:13,120
is they don't know what to do

940
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,480
they don't know what to do

941
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,840
and the medical media books have already

942
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,760
proven themselves

943
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:19,840
i can sit here and

944
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:21,760
stand on a soapbox

945
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:24,799
i can sit here shout it from the

946
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:27,600
rooftops i can sit here on a mountaintop

947
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:29,679
and shout it all day long

948
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:31,279
because the books have worked and turned

949
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:33,519
people's lives around and fixed the

950
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:35,519
thyroid i just how many people i see

951
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:37,679
stories every single day my god you

952
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:39,440
fixed my hashimoto's oh my god your book

953
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:41,279
saved me my hashimoto's is gone oh my

954
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:43,440
god my hypothyroidism is but my doctor

955
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:45,440
can't believe it hey my cyst on my

956
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,600
thyroid disappeared after doing medical

957
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:50,000
medium protocols for thyroid oh my god

958
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:51,679
like it's all the time out there

959
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,360
spirulina is one of the things to use

960
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:57,679
that's the vibrancy spirulina lysine

961
00:32:55,360 --> 00:33:00,080
when you're dealing with these viruses

962
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:03,519
that create thyroid problems you need

963
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:06,720
the lysine to knock down the viral load

964
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:08,880
viral load

965
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,640
you need the lysine to knock down the

966
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,320
viral load

967
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:14,720
because these viruses that create

968
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:16,399
thyroid problems are herpetic

969
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:18,799
really important to know right there

970
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:21,200
vitamin b12

971
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:23,519
okay what does it say vitamin b12 one

972
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,200
drop or full twice a day get your

973
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:26,960
dropper full in there

974
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,360
get very important

975
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:31,360
so magnesium glycinate

976
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:33,600
hey well no i'm taking magnesium and how

977
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:34,880
come my thyroid is not better

978
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,559
well one reason is you're probably

979
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,919
taking magnesium

980
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:39,679
but you're not taking magnesium

981
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:42,399
glycinate

982
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:44,080
so it's not absorbing

983
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:46,880
absorbing

984
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:48,320
you're not feeding your cells it's that

985
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,080
magnesium glycinate that does the

986
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:52,080
difference where it feeds the cell so

987
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:57,360
it'll say magnesium glycinate on here

988
00:33:52,080 --> 00:34:00,320
one capsule twice a day is what it says

989
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:02,960
microc so it has vitamin c is what it's

990
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:04,960
recommending in here right

991
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:08,800
vitamin c

992
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:11,599
um six capsules twice a day

993
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:13,520
so in order to knock down viral loads

994
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:15,760
you've got to have your immune system

995
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:17,119
being fed with that antioxidant that

996
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:20,000
vitamin c

997
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:21,760
that's the immune building antioxidant

998
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,000
that vitamin c

999
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,119
really important

1000
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,320
so

1001
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:29,599
you gotta have the vitamin c if you have

1002
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:32,720
look you look

1003
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:34,560
if you get overwhelmed do one thing

1004
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:36,879
one thing ask your doctor do one thing

1005
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:38,399
i'll take a little b12 it says here in

1006
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:41,119
the book you could read the chapter and

1007
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:42,639
you could read like how you can navigate

1008
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:44,480
do one thing

1009
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:46,879
do two things

1010
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:49,919
but know you're on the right right track

1011
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:51,919
know that you're on the right track

1012
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:53,280
that's the whole thing

1013
00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:54,480
that you know you're heading on the

1014
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:57,040
right direction

1015
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:59,200
kim says does this mean only rich people

1016
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:01,040
