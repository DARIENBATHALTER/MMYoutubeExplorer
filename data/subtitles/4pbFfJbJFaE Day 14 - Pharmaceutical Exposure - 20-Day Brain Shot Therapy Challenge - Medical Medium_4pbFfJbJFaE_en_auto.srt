166
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:37,560
you're aware of it

167
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:39,960
you may not be completely aware of what

168
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:44,160
was in the medication

169
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:47,460
you at least know it was administered

170
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:50,520

171
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:52,139

192
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:43,500
it still can be in your brain and body

193
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:46,979
now and you don't know pre-memory you

194
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:49,620
took it when you were a baby or a child

195
00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:51,539
so this is an incredible little chapter

196
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:53,099
right here in the medical medium brain

197
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:54,780
saver I'm reading out of okay you guys

198
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:57,539
just wanted to

199
00:07:54,780 --> 00:08:00,060
start with us today and we're making the

200
00:07:57,539 --> 00:08:02,819
pharmaceutical exposure shot

201
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:05,340
so it's a brain shot therapy I'm excited

202
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:07,380
we're day 14 today

203
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:09,180
water supply

204
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:11,580
interesting

205
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:14,720
more and more Pharmaceuticals are

206
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:14,720
entering the water supply

207
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:21,180
because people who are taking them then

208
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:23,419
eliminate them when they go to the

209
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,419
bathroom

210
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:28,080
so think about that

211
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:31,080
where does it all go

212
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:35,339
it has to go somewhere no matter what

213
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:38,700
billions of people going to bathroom

214
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:41,339
well over a billion people easy on this

215
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:44,099
planet or are on Pharmaceuticals

216
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:46,560
more than that

217
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:49,140
where's it going

218
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:52,860
when they go to the bathroom

219
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:56,160
this also means that medication laced

220
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:58,680
water can become a part of our food

221
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,899
through reservoirs

222
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:04,260
irrigation

223
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:07,080
Public Water Supplies

224
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:09,360
well water near septic tanks

225
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,800
and fish swimming in lakes rivers and

226
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,660
oceans

227
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,660
there are other ways to get this

228
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:19,100
pharmaceutical laced water

229
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:19,100
such as brushing our teeth

230
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:23,060
cooking with tap water

231
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:29,519
swimming in lakes and rivers pools pools

232
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:32,100
swimming in poles

233
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:34,620
and that's a whole thing there too if

234
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:37,320
you're on vacation and you're swimming

235
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:39,600
in a pool

236
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:42,540
public pool

237
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,700
you don't take Pharmaceuticals

238
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:46,620
but maybe a whole bunch of people in

239
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:48,660
that same pool take Pharmaceuticals and

240
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:51,360
it's leaching out of their skin their

241
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:53,760
pores their armpits

242
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:56,700
and everywhere else

243
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,860
that water is not being replaced

244
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:01,380
that's sitting in a pool

245
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:03,720
that water can be the same water in that

246
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:06,540
pool for 10 years

247
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:09,980
they don't drain pools and replace water

248
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:09,980
it's too expensive

249
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,779
it's not it's not a common practice

250
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:20,160
so in hotels or anywhere else in public

251
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:22,620
pools that water can be 10 years old

252
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,959
thousands of people could have swam in

253
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:27,300
it and pharmaceuticals could have

254
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:29,399
leached off their bodies into that pool

255
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:33,320
water and now pool water is never being

256
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:33,320
tested for pharmaceuticals

257
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:39,540
water parks

258
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:41,339
restaurant water normally contains

259
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:42,839
pharmaceutical runoff

260
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:44,940
did you hear that one

261
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:46,920
restaurant water

262
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:47,940
the really good one there

263
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:50,180
so

264
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:54,779
you're eating in a restaurant that water

265
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:56,760
most likely contains Pharmaceuticals

266
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:57,959
all right let's go let's hit pools and

267
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:00,540
water parks

268
00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:02,760
I'm on page 200 brain saver I mean this

269
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:05,100
is an interesting topic right I mean I

270
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:06,480
think this is really interesting when

271
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,519
Spirit of compassion was giving me this

272
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,399
information I was just like okay no I'm

273
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:13,640
I'm hooked I'm hooked

274
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:13,640
foreign

275
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:20,399
water parks swimming in a pole or water

276
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:23,100
park doesn't only lead to pharmaceutical

277
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:25,680
exposure via the water supply

278
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:27,720
there's also the runoff coming from

279
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,820
people's bodies

280
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:32,700
when you're swimming in a hotel pool

281
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:34,740
here we go for example

282
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:37,200
there's pharmaceutical runoff coming

283
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:40,320
from people's skin and out of their

284
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,660
armpits their genitals

285
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,399
yeah

286
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:48,260
Pharmaceuticals coming out of their

287
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,260
genitals in the pool

288
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,560
Pharmaceuticals are coming out of their

289
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,060
mouth if they get water in their mouth

290
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:57,180
how many people are swimming and they're

291
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:58,320
spitting out water they're getting water

292
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:00,540
in their mouth

293
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:03,360
it's not like someone swimming in a pool

294
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:04,920
and they close their mouth perfectly and

295
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,899
they don't talk to their friend that's

296
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:09,180
also swimming and they're swimming

297
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:12,360
around with their mouth sealed shut and

298
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:15,200
after they get out of the pool they dry

299
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,200
off their face

300
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:21,540
no people get water in and out of their

301
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:24,000
mouth when they're swimming in the pool

302
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:25,920
I've seen people just

303
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,399
spitting water out of their mouth in the

304
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,399
pool of course

305
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,899
when you're swimming in a hotel pool for

306
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,700
example there's pharmaceutical runoff

307
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:37,519
coming from people's skin and out of

308
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:40,019
their armpits their genitals their mouth

309
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:43,820
if they get water in their mouth and

310
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:43,820
even their urine and feces

311
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:49,620
if they urinate defecate or pass gas in

312
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:51,779
the poll

313
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:54,000
the pool water becomes a filter for

314
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:57,839
what's in the gas

315
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,519
it's a pharmaceutical bath

316
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:02,880
so which is interesting right here

317
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:07,800
anybody who farts in a pool

318
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:10,620
the pool becomes a filter for that gas

319
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:15,019
that's coming out of the person

320
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:15,019
the gas that's coming out of the person

321
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:19,740
has Pharmaceuticals in the gas

322
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,480
so if there's a whole bunch of people

323
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:22,980
swimming around in a pool and they're

324
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,480
farting in a pool and they're letting

325
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:27,779
out gas

326
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:29,639
that gas is loaded with particles of

327
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:31,440
pharmaceuticals it's like a

328
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:32,639
pharmaceutical aerosol coming out of

329
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,920
their body if they're on anything

330
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:38,700
thyroid medication statins blood

331
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:41,579
pressure pills antibiotics

332
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:42,839
the pill anything doesn't matter what it

333
00:13:41,579 --> 00:13:44,339
is

334
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:47,220
um amphetamines prescription

335
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:49,260
amphetamines all of it right so opioids

336
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:51,839
whatever it is that they're on

337
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:54,540
it's coming out if they were at the

338
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:58,019
dentist and they had lidocaine they had

339
00:13:54,540 --> 00:14:00,779
novocaine lidocaine septicane whatever

340
00:13:58,019 --> 00:14:02,399
it is that they had it's in their body

341
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:04,079
so they went to the dentist they just

342
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,240
had lidocaine

343
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:07,980
they had some dental work done they're

344
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:11,959
swimming in the pool they fart in the

345
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:11,959
pool lidocaine is now in the pool water

346
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:16,920
syriana says chlorine doesn't eliminate

347
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,500
this no

348
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:20,279
chlorine is just for microbes you know

349
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:23,220
like

350
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:24,420
microbes microorganisms amoebas stuff

351
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:26,760
like that

352
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:30,120
stuff that's naturally happening because

353
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:32,040
it's it's it's Standalone water

354
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:34,560
the water is

355
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:37,740
standing still

356
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:40,620
so because it's not like it's just water

357
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:43,199
sitting in a pool

358
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:45,300
it has to stay fresh so they kill off

359
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:47,160
microbes with chlorine chlorine doesn't

360
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:48,660
eliminate any of this that's not an

361
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:50,820
Eliminator of all the Pharmaceuticals

362
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:52,800
Elena says oh my God I remember when I

363
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:54,959
was swimming this summer in a pool it

364
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:57,180
got so much worse and there was a time

365
00:14:54,959 --> 00:15:00,540
when someone

366
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:03,420
threw up in a pool

367
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:05,279
they just fished it out laugh out loud

368
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:08,279
never drained the pole and we all went

369
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:10,980
back they never drained the pole it's

370
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:13,260
too costly for the hotels

371
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:15,839
so and and water parks and stuff like

372
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:18,899
that gotta remember if you're gonna

373
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:21,420
drain 200 000 gallons of water

374
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:23,459
you have to pay for that 200 000 gallons

375
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:25,920
of water to get put back in hotels don't

376
00:15:23,459 --> 00:15:28,260
do that your water will stay there for

377
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:31,380
10 years 15 years unless the pool has to

378
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:33,120
be fixed if the pool cracks or breaks

379
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:35,459
then they have to drain the pool they

380
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,079
have to eat the money and the cost they

381
00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:39,480
have to seal to crack and then they have

382
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:41,880
to fill the pool back in right

383
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:45,120
so what I'm trying to say is your pool

384
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:47,220
water can Harbor Pharmaceuticals for 10

385
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,639
years building up in the water it never

386
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:49,639
goes away

387
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:55,740
sure oh here's something interesting

388
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:57,839
here so since the person that I read the

389
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:59,399
comments said does Chlor chlorine get

390
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,920
rid of it right

391
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:05,760
chlorinating it sure they chlorinate the

392
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:07,800
water to shock it for parasites bacteria

393
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:10,860
and algae

394
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:12,660
that chlorine doesn't remove any of the

395
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:16,620
pharmaceutical residue in the water

396
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:18,480
supply or the runoff from people's skin

397
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:20,459
do you have the book I know the person

398
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,660
said what about chlorinating does that

399
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:24,720
help that means you might not have the

400
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:26,639
book because it says it in here

401
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,339
you should get this book and read the

402
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:32,360
blood draw agenda chapter

403
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:32,360
it's just incredible

404
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:37,440
inner truth healing says oh my God makes

405
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:39,600
so much sense

406
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:42,540
but not common sense

407
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,519
because it's not common about this

408
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:47,220
information it's from Spirit of

409
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:50,220
compassion yes it makes sense though

410
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:52,920
Red Raven says oh people put babies with

411
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:56,699
diapers on in the pool indeed they do

412
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:58,920
and babies get Medical Treatments

413
00:16:56,699 --> 00:17:01,440
everybody's well aware of that ends up

414
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:03,600
in the pool

415
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,939
and adults get Medical Treatments

416
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:08,059
everybody's aware of that ends up in the

417
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:08,059
pool

418
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:13,860
somebody says on IG free as a bird says

419
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:16,679
144 good number I think this is the most

420
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:18,959
shocking info I heard so far even if we

421
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:20,339
are on no meds we can get them from

422
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:23,339
others

423
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:25,559
never like fools

424
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:27,360
every time Spirit of compassion gives me

425
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:29,280
a piece of information from above it's

426
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:30,900
the most shocking ever

427
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,460
over and over again

428
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:34,860
how many years

429
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:37,860
how many times have I had to deliver the

430
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:40,740
message of shocking information

431
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:42,179
and then I get branded the worst crap

432
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:44,400
hit pieces on me saying I'm

433
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:45,600
fear-mongering hit pieces on me saying

434
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,520
whatever

435
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:50,039
and I'm just trying to deliver the

436
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:51,059
information from above and yes it's

437
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:53,520
shocking

438
00:17:51,059 --> 00:17:55,500
just like the blood draw agenda that's

439
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,179
shocking too that blows people's minds

440
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,980
when they hear about that it's just it's

441
00:17:57,179 --> 00:18:00,600
all the medical meme information is

442
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:01,679
mind-blowing people deserve to know the

443
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,840
truth so they can make their own

444
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:06,120
decisions but I get to discriminated

445
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:09,120
against and punished for it

446
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:11,820
punished for I mean people they use a

447
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:13,320
new tactic now oh oh reliable source I

448
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:15,720
got a reliable source that says don't

449
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:18,240
trust medical mediums information that's

450
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:20,820
the new thing now on social

451
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,380
oh yeah it's from reliable source that

452
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:24,600
says you know don't trust medical

453
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:26,160
mediums info oh really and what's a

454
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,360
reliable source some other influencer

455
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,760
that hates me

456
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:32,280
anyway

457
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:34,080
check this out sure they chlorinate the

458
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:36,120
water to shock it from for parasites

459
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,980
bacteria and algae that chlorine doesn't

460
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:39,720
remove any of the pharmaceutical residue

461
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:42,900
in the water supply or the runoff from

462
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:45,600
people's skin those Pharmaceuticals stay

463
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:48,000
in the pool water unless the pool is

464
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,440
fully drained which guess what the poles

465
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,640
are never fully drained they're never

466
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,160
drained

467
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,520
unless 10 years later there's a crack in

468
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,520
the pool

469
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:03,720
pool water can stay in the pool for a

470
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:07,080
very long time without ever getting a

471
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:10,200
repair that calls for it to be drained

472
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:12,660
at a hotel for example you could have

473
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:15,240
pharmaceutical filled water for five

474
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:17,760
straight years or more

475
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:20,340
where it concentrates year after year

476
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:22,559
and doesn't dissipate

477
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:26,400
and pools never get tested for

478
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:28,740
pharmaceutical levels ever

479
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,940
there are so many Pharmaceuticals in

480
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:33,240
pool water

481
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:36,240
no one could even imagine it is a

482
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:39,980
pharmaceutical bath of hundreds of

483
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,980
different kinds of pharmaceuticals

484
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:43,440
all right

485
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:47,100
I'm glad that's the most shocking thing

486
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:48,840
you've ever heard because there's a lot

487
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:51,360
of shocking stuff in the medical medium

488
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:54,500
books way more shocking than that all

489
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,500
right let's go into food supply

490
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,840
antibiotics

491
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,660
I can't help but I'm just laughing today

492
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:10,080
I don't know why I'm laughing today but

493
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:12,840
I am Danielle says why is 144 a good

494
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:15,539
number I'm always seeing it and I was

495
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:19,039
born at 144. listen to my telegram audio

496
00:20:15,539 --> 00:20:22,940
message on numbers I talk about 144

497
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:22,940
talked about it for years

498
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:26,539
since I was a kid

499
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:32,580
okay food supply

500
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:35,340
antibiotic fed animals

501
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:37,440
translate to our ingesting antibiotics

502
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:39,059
when we eat their eggs meat fish and

503
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,039
Dairy

504
00:20:39,059 --> 00:20:42,780
even if you take care to find the

505
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:44,820
highest quality best treated animal

506
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:47,000
products for when you prepare food at

507
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:47,000
home

508
00:20:47,059 --> 00:20:52,799
yeah

509
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:55,620
but you don't eat antibiotic fed animal

510
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:57,780
products do you

511
00:20:55,620 --> 00:21:00,120
so you think

512
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:01,740
which is a great perspective measure if

513
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:03,419
you eat animal products because you

514
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:05,100
don't want to take any you don't want to

515
00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:07,320
eat animal

516
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:11,160
products that are

517
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:13,740
subjected to antibiotics

518
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:16,380
and other Pharmaceuticals you've likely

519
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:18,720
been unable to avoid eating conventional

520
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:21,120
animal products when dining out or

521
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:23,700
eating at a friend's house

522
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:25,559
and that means antibiotic exposure so

523
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:28,679
you mean to tell me

524
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:30,360
there's not one meal you had

525
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:33,059
over a friend's house or a family

526
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:36,299
member's house or in a restaurant

527
00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:38,039
that you can guarantee

528
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:42,179
was

529
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:44,640
not an anti-antibiotic fed animal

530
00:21:42,179 --> 00:21:49,200
like you can guarantee it

531
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:51,600
like there's not one meal you had

532
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:54,659
eating out somewhere friends house

533
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:57,240
family's house wherever

534
00:21:54,659 --> 00:21:59,880
now you can guarantee

535
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:02,480
that there were no antibiotics fed to

536
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,480
those animals

537
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:08,039
you've likely been unable to avoid

538
00:22:06,419 --> 00:22:09,840
eating conventional animal products when

539
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:14,059
dining out or eating at a friend's house

540
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:14,059
and that means antibiotic exposure

541
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:17,780
should I go on you guys

542
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:22,860
also animals are treated with

543
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:25,919
antibiotics when sick even if it's not

544
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:29,299
an antibiotic fed animal or meat I'm

545
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:29,299
going to go into details about that

546
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:37,020
even if you take great care to avoid

547
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:39,419
eating animals fed antibiotics now

548
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:41,600
what about the first 10 years of your

549
00:22:39,419 --> 00:22:41,600
life

550
00:22:42,059 --> 00:22:47,940
was that 100 antibiotic

551
00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:50,940
free animal products

552
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:53,700
were the first 20 years of your life or

553
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:55,980
even the first 30 years of your life

554
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:58,799
those antibiotics

555
00:22:55,980 --> 00:23:01,860
that you were exposed to during a

556
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:05,580
previous chapter in your life's store up

557
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:07,500
over time your entire lifetime basically

558
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:09,960
what it said is

559
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:13,140
you had antibiotic fed

560
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:15,299
Pro animal products long ago and stored

561
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:17,960
up in your body and never left

562
00:23:15,299 --> 00:23:17,960
never left

563
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,860
Mina Levy says I am living proof of my

564
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:25,320
experience

565
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:27,539
I am livering proof my experience was

566
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:29,880
terrifying until this man described what

567
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:32,100
was going on

568
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:33,780
not one doctor could

569
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:35,580
you saved my life

570
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:38,520
and my sanity

571
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:41,520
he's the real deal and his source is

572
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:43,919
knowledge to the haters of the solution

573
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:46,820
not the problem

574
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,820
thank you Anthony

575
00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:52,980
thank you Tamara says oh my God this is

576
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:55,200
shocking what a barf face you know the

577
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:58,020
emoji with the green barf coming out

578
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:01,200

you on YouTube thank you Tamara

581
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:09,720
Andre here

582
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:10,860
all right should I keep on reading a

583
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:13,559
little bit more we'll talk about it

584
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:15,840
because I'm a brain saver get a whole

585
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:18,600
bunch of ingredients here for the

586
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:20,780
pharmaceutical exposure shot I'm excited

587
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,780
about

588
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:28,100
keep in mind

589
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:30,659
grass-fed animals

590
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:32,539
grass-fed beef

591
00:24:30,659 --> 00:24:35,120
free range

592
00:24:32,539 --> 00:24:39,059
pastured chicken

593
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:42,360
organic fed pigs

594
00:24:39,059 --> 00:24:44,760
still occasionally get infections and

595
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:47,600
get sick and get treated with steroids

596
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,600
and antibiotics

597
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:54,240
here's how it works

598
00:24:50,539 --> 00:24:59,280
grass-fed cows

599
00:24:54,240 --> 00:25:02,960
don't get antibiotics and steroids mixed

600
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:02,960
in with their grass

601
00:25:03,299 --> 00:25:06,799
they're a grass-fed cow

602
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:11,700
but when the grass-fed cow gets sick

603
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:14,760
which

604
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:17,820
most of them do at one point

605
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:19,440
they get treated for that sickness with

606
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:22,260
antibiotics

607
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:26,340
and steroids

608
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:30,419
but they don't have to legally

609
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:33,720
put that on the package that that cow

610
00:25:30,419 --> 00:25:37,980
that you're eating that steak from

611
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:40,320
was sick for a week or two and was on an

612
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:42,419
actual treatment you don't get told that

613
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:46,980
it won't say it on the package instead

614
00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:51,179
it'll say grass fed beef

615
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:53,640
because they didn't do a daily drug

616
00:25:51,179 --> 00:25:58,159
treatment mixed in their food like they

617
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:58,159
do the industrial cows and animals

618
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:04,500
keep in mind grass-fed animals grass-fed

619
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:06,659
beef free range pasture chicken organic

620
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:08,640
fed pigs still occasionally get

621
00:26:06,659 --> 00:26:11,840
infections and get sick and get treated

622
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,840
with steroids and antibiotics

623
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:17,220
if you're eating chopped meat grass-fed

624
00:26:15,539 --> 00:26:21,659
chopped meat

625
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:25,559
remember that chopped meat isn't one cow

626
00:26:21,659 --> 00:26:27,360
that chopped meat can be a hundred cows

627
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:29,400
a chopped meat

628
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:31,020
is chop me

629
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:33,299
that's mixed

630
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:36,000
with a hundred other animals

631
00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:38,940
all ground up together

632
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,039
maybe 20 of those hundred animals never

633
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:43,140
experience a pharmaceutical in their

634
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:44,640
diet obviously not in their diet they're

635
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:47,940
grass-fed right never experience a

636
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:51,179
pharmaceutical treatment for being sick

637
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:52,440
but the other 80 cows that are ground up

638
00:26:51,179 --> 00:26:53,940
into that chopped meat to make that

639
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:55,679
grass-fed Burger

640
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:58,679
could have had

641
00:26:55,679 --> 00:27:01,220
treatments for being sick

642
00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:01,220
foreign

643
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:08,880
against animal protein or animal protein

644
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:12,240
eating

645
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:14,880
I support everybody regardless of what

646
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,500
diet they choose I just teach people how

647
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:19,200
to do it better

648
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:20,279
that's it I message information from

649
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,260
above

650
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:24,539
so they can learn how to take care of

651
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:26,279
themselves better

652
00:27:24,539 --> 00:27:28,799
so if you're a vegan

653
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:31,919
you can be a vegan I'm pro-vegan Pro

654
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:34,740
plant-based but there's a way to do it

655
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:36,240
that you can customize to heal because

656
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:38,940
there's a lot of sick vegans out there

657
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,500
they never heal and they're getting bits

658
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:42,960
and pieces of medical meme information

659
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:44,940
that's shrinkling out of the communities

660
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:47,460
and they poach it and stuff so it's

661
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:49,260
helping vegans out there

662
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:52,140
and they don't say to back them in but

663
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:55,260
the point is is as a vegan as a

664
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:57,600
plant-based person someone might be

665
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:59,400
this information is here for them to

666
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,720
take it to the next level and still stay

667
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,100
vegan or plant-based now if you're an

668
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,179
animal protein person it's the same

669
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:06,299
thing

670
00:28:03,179 --> 00:28:08,340
I don't shun shame or judge anybody for

671
00:28:06,299 --> 00:28:10,860
being an animal protein person

672
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:13,080
in the medical medium community

673
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:14,700
quite the opposite instead if that's

674
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:18,059
what you want to do I want to help you

675
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:20,520
do it right so you can customize

676
00:28:18,059 --> 00:28:22,559
and do what you need to do to heal if

677
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:24,419
that's what you want to do

678
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:26,580
so I don't want anybody thinking this is

679
00:28:24,419 --> 00:28:29,279
some weird you know animal protein

680
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:30,659
campaign slash vegan thing that's not

681
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:32,580
what this is this is just information

682
00:28:30,659 --> 00:28:35,159
from above that I have to message to

683
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:37,159
everybody it's just the truth

684
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:39,720
foreign

685
00:28:37,159 --> 00:28:43,140
Spirit lover says what about natural

686
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:46,380
salt water pools like not public pools

687
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:48,419
but for home it's not about if it's

688
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:50,220
natural salt water

689
00:28:48,419 --> 00:28:52,559
Spirit lover

690
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:55,080
or chlorine based

691
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:57,000
which snaps or salt water kind of is is

692
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:58,320
a type of fluorine based it's just

693
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,299
different it's the natural salt right

694
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:02,520
the point is Spirit lover

695
00:29:00,299 --> 00:29:04,080
it's not about that it's about who's in

696
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:06,240
your pool

697
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:08,580
it's a spirit lover you said

698
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:11,159
but for home instead of a public pool

699
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:12,480
right well yeah a public pool means you

700
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:14,700
got a whole bunch of people going in

701
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:17,940
there and all their gunks coming out of

702
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:19,140
their body at home in your own pool I

703
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:21,539
don't know who's swimming in your own

704
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:24,539
pool I don't know who's in there

705
00:29:21,539 --> 00:29:27,179
is Auntie Jane in there is Uncle Bob in

706
00:29:24,539 --> 00:29:28,559
there are they on 10 Pharmaceuticals are

707
00:29:27,179 --> 00:29:30,059
they swimming around in your pool and

708
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:32,220
then that pharmaceutical is in your pool

709
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:34,559
for a lifetime unless you drain the

710
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:36,480
water but the point is Spirit lover it's

711
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:38,640
about who's in your pool doesn't matter

712
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,679
what kind of

713
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:43,039
system you have whether it's all salt or

714
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:43,039
chlorine

715
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:47,940
problem is with medical medium

716
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:50,460
information over and over again there's

717
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:52,980
one huge problem

718
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:55,520
because it comes from above it does this

719
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:55,520
all the time

720
00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:03,419
just close your mind and then people are

721
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:05,520
just like what the f and then the word

722
00:30:03,419 --> 00:30:07,440
gets out they're always like fear Monger

723
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:09,840
fear Monger instead it's more like

724
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:14,179
Empower and Power

725
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:14,179
because the information empowers people

726
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:20,760
hit the thumbs up if you like this video

727
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:23,360
if you don't like the video hit the

728
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,360
thumbs up please

729
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:28,260
keep in mind grass-fed animals grass-fed

730
00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:30,059
beef free-range bastard chickens we're

731
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:32,640
getting that big still occasionally get

732
00:30:30,059 --> 00:30:35,340
infections get skin problems get sick

733
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:37,860
and get treatments with steroids and

734
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:39,299
antibiotics they're just not as

735
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:41,100
saturated for the most part with

736
00:30:39,299 --> 00:30:43,440
antibiotics for chronic contagious

737
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:46,380
infections or conventionally raised

738
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:48,240
foods with the drugs in them that

739
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:50,580
animals are on in the industrial places

740
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:53,880
when chronic infections do occur with

741
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:55,980
grass-fed animals raised free range and

742
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:58,200
pastured some animals are out of

743
00:30:55,980 --> 00:31:00,960
commission for a while due to an ongoing

744
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:03,659
infection that takes a month to treat

745
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:05,039
once recovered the animal is back in the

746
00:31:03,659 --> 00:31:07,919
running again

747
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:09,720
you're set free cow you're better now

748
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:12,240
you were sick for a month and went into

749
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:15,000
a different station on the farm and Now

750
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:18,059
cal you're free you're free to roam and

751
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:20,460
everything right oh let me see here and

752
00:31:18,059 --> 00:31:23,840
that's what happens it's like

753
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:23,840
like cow is now free

754
00:31:24,539 --> 00:31:28,760
the cow's free to roam and everything

755
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:28,760
right

756
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:34,279
now once a cow's free

757
00:31:36,779 --> 00:31:41,340
yeah

758
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:44,700
the cow goes back into

759
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:47,640
playing reindeer games on the farm

760
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:49,919
the cow might have been sick for a month

761
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:53,039
and then put out a commission

762
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:54,179
but the cow gets better and then goes

763
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:56,159
back in

764
00:31:54,179 --> 00:31:59,360
for the slaughter later

765
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:59,360
to be on somebody's table

766
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:04,140
once recovered the animal is back in the

767
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:06,899
running again

768
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:09,779
it's still listed as grass-fed beef

769
00:32:06,899 --> 00:32:12,860
doesn't matter if your grass-fed cow was

770
00:32:09,779 --> 00:32:16,260
sick for a month it's still listed as

771
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:18,600
grass-fed beef

772
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:20,940
doesn't matter if your grass-fed cow had

773
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:26,059
antibiotics and steroids and

774
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:26,059
anti-fungals like they do

775
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:30,659
you don't hear this stuff getting talked

776
00:32:27,899 --> 00:32:32,340
about in all the animal hate stuff like

777
00:32:30,659 --> 00:32:34,919
all the vegan stuff and all the

778
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:36,179
propaganda out there everybody says

779
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:37,799
they're an expert you don't hear any of

780
00:32:36,179 --> 00:32:39,419
this stuff talked about because

781
00:32:37,799 --> 00:32:41,460
you know you'll hear it talked about now

782
00:32:39,419 --> 00:32:44,720
now that the books are out right well it

783
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:44,720
didn't come from medical medium though

784
00:32:45,899 --> 00:32:51,179
they'll say

785
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,159
Liars it's still listed as grass-fed

786
00:32:51,179 --> 00:32:55,500
beef and ready for the market when the

787
00:32:53,159 --> 00:32:58,559
time comes we're shielded from this

788
00:32:55,500 --> 00:33:01,200
information it's kept from the inside

789
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:04,440
goings on when you're in the market

790
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:06,779
you're shielded from the fact that the

791
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:09,779
grass-fed animals were still treated

792
00:33:06,779 --> 00:33:11,580
they still have drugs inside of them and

793
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:15,260
they were put back on the market and

794
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:15,260
they have the label of grass-fed beef

795
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:20,159
you can't always avoid all these things

796
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:22,679
the pharmaceutical exposure shot so you

797
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:24,779
can get them out of your system you

798
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:27,059
can't always avoid all of these things

799
00:33:24,779 --> 00:33:29,039
it's not about shutting your life down

800
00:33:27,059 --> 00:33:32,220
it's not about you can't live your life

801
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:33,899
anymore it's not about being afraid it's

802
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:35,760
just about being empowered so you can

803
00:33:33,899 --> 00:33:38,100
make choices I would like to know what's

804
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:41,000
going on personally I would like to know

805
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:41,000
what's going on myself

806
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:48,000
laughs

807
00:33:45,779 --> 00:33:50,159
and having tools like these brain shot

808
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,019
therapies is incredible because not only

809
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:54,120
can we deep like know about it we can do

810
00:33:52,019 --> 00:33:57,960
something about it we think it's

811
00:33:54,120 --> 00:34:00,059
inconceivable that the animals have ever

812
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:02,820
had something wrong with them

813
00:34:00,059 --> 00:34:06,960
there's no way in hell

814
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:09,720
this package of grass-fed beef

815
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:12,179
had an animal

816
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:13,919
have something wrong with it there's no

817
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:17,520
way in hell this package of grass-fed

818
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:20,099
beef I'm holding my hand somehow this

819
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:21,659
animal that once was an animal and now

820
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:23,220
it's in this package wrapped with

821
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:25,560
whatever

822
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:28,679
and sealed in this package there's no

823
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:31,760
way that this was a sick animal it says

824
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:31,760
grass-fed beef you know

825
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:36,179
we think it's inconceivable that the

826
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:38,339
animals have ever had something wrong

827
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:40,560
with them any kind of infection or

828
00:34:38,339 --> 00:34:42,839
illness it's inconceivable there's no

829
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:45,060
way one animal had something wrong with

830
00:34:42,839 --> 00:34:47,339
it it's grass-fed it's pre-range

831
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:49,379
pasteurized there's no way it had

832
00:34:47,339 --> 00:34:52,200
anything wrong with it

833
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:54,300
I don't want you under the illusion that

834
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:57,960
you're not going to get antibiotics from

835
00:34:54,300 --> 00:35:00,660
grass-fed meat because it's not true I

836
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:03,900
don't want anybody under the illusion

837
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:05,640
the scam illusion

838
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:07,440
that you're not going to get any

839
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:09,180
Pharmaceuticals from your grass-fed

840
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:11,900
products and so forth and free range

841
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:11,900
products and everything

842
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:18,000
Marion

843
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:23,119
McGinty

844
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,119
McIntyre says blowing my mind today

845
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:31,440
okay more pharmaceutical exposure

846
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:33,859
sources are you guys ready you guys

847
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,859
ready for this

848
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:37,099
all right

849
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:40,700
thank you

850
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,820
sorry guys

851
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:49,920
a lot of people get medication exposure

852
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:53,460
from the flea or tick powder or cream

853
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:55,859
they apply to their dogs and cats

854
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:59,040
if you can tell me

855
00:35:55,859 --> 00:36:02,099
that you never had a tick collar or flea

856
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:04,500
collar on your dog or cat

857
00:36:02,099 --> 00:36:07,800
if you can tell me you never put a flea

858
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:10,560
powder or tick powder on your cat or dog

859
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:13,640
if you can tell me they never received a

860
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,640
medication before

861
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:19,440
that would be amazing

862
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:24,599
at least you don't have to get exposed

863
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:27,839
right and it's okay I I love

864
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:32,940
doggies and cats I love animals

865
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:35,160
and um I would never ever shame a dog or

866
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:37,140
judge a dog or cat or animal because

867
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:38,640
they had to have a medication from the

868
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:40,140
vet or anything

869
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:44,839
I'm just saying that if there is

870
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:44,839
exposure we got the brain shot therapy

871
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:52,200
a lot of people get medication exposure

872
00:36:50,099 --> 00:36:54,119
from flea tick powders creams they apply

873
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:58,099
to their dogs and cats or from flea and

874
00:36:54,119 --> 00:36:58,099
tick repelling pet collars

875
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:03,420
intimacy

876
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:05,640
is another form of pharmaceutical

877
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:07,560
exposure for example kissing someone

878
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:10,560
who's on medication

879
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:13,859
I talked about that earlier

880
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:16,560
then there are medicated creams that

881
00:37:13,859 --> 00:37:17,820
have a powerful out gas

882
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:21,900
now

883
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:24,260
I'm not trying to be like take this so

884
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:24,260
far

885
00:37:24,839 --> 00:37:30,180
that it's like so mind-blowing

886
00:37:28,619 --> 00:37:34,220
but I'm just gonna tell you what happens

887
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:34,220
at the stores at the grocery store

888
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:39,660
a lot of people

889
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:41,579
have medications that are creams and

890
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:42,839
they rub them on all parts of their

891
00:37:41,579 --> 00:37:45,720
bodies

892
00:37:42,839 --> 00:37:48,300
it's one of the biggest pharmaceutical

893
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:51,000
industry part there is

894
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:53,579
creams

895
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:56,220
creams that are pharmaceutical based

896
00:37:53,579 --> 00:37:58,380
drugs and creams

897
00:37:56,220 --> 00:38:00,359
everybody puts their creams on in the

898
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:02,520
morning

899
00:38:00,359 --> 00:38:04,140
wherever they're going to rub it

900
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:07,680
like wherever

901
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:10,260
their butt wherever creams are big

902
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:13,260
creams for their butt

903
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:15,060
the rectums

904
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:16,980
for hemorrhoids

905
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:19,980
creams for everything

906
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:21,960
creams for their skin rashes creams for

907
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:24,540
their skin tags

908
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:26,339
people are on creams

909
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:28,560
and then they go to the grocery store

910
00:38:26,339 --> 00:38:30,780
after they creamed up

911
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:32,880
steroid creams everything

912
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:35,099
and now they're going through all the

913
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:38,400
produce and they're rubbing their creams

914
00:38:35,099 --> 00:38:39,660
on all the produce and packaged food and

915
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,060
everything

916
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:43,140
but it's not just one person thousands

917
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:45,599
of people going through the grocery

918
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:47,520
stores and farmers markets

919
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:48,619
and they're getting their creams on

920
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:51,359
everything

921
00:38:48,619 --> 00:38:53,579
chemotherapy cream

922
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:55,200
I can't tell you how many times Spirit

923
00:38:53,579 --> 00:38:56,640
of compassion has told me when I was at

924
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:59,400
a farmer's market that someone's

925
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:01,560
chemotherapy cream

926
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:04,520
was rubbed on produce

927
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:04,520
or something else

928
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:08,460
so many people are on chemotherapy

929
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,079
creams

930
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:11,880
that's why they're at a farmer's market

931
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:13,800
they're trying to eat healthier they've

932
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:16,680
been diagnosed with cancer

933
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:18,359
and they're using the creams

934
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:20,400
foreign

935
00:39:18,359 --> 00:39:23,160
there's

936
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:25,560
a lot of pharmaceutical creams

937
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:28,140
so that are that it's it's incredible

938
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:31,200
right how it works so so many people

939
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:33,440
have creams on them and it's getting on

940
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,440
everything

941
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:38,099
so I'm not saying

942
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:40,619
I mean we just got to live on planet

943
00:39:38,099 --> 00:39:43,560
Earth can't hide from it

944
00:39:40,619 --> 00:39:45,900
but that's why I like having tools

945
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:48,000
so that if I'm getting some of that

946
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:50,280
stuff in me here and there somehow

947
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,960
grabbing this package grabbing that and

948
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:55,760
I'm getting it in me

949
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:55,760
I want to have a tool to help

950
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:03,720
Danielle says I've worked at a ranch

951
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:07,140
all grass fed every year they brand them

952
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:08,880
and cut the balls off the steers and

953
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:11,220
they give them a shot of antibiotics

954
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:14,599
every single baby cow

955
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:14,599
it's pharmaceutical exposure

956
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:20,000
oh God that's awful

957
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:20,000
um

958
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:27,660
then there are medicated creams that

959
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:30,420
have a powerful out gas

960
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:32,280
a large variety of medicated creams from

961
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:34,980
steroid creams to chemotherapy creams

962
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:36,960
out gas a very potent pungent smell that

963
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:38,880
the person using the cream is unaware of

964
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:41,520
because they live in it breathing in

965
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:44,520
this gassing is exposure

966
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:46,980
but I talked about about the exposure in

967
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:50,599
the stores right basic contact with

968
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:50,599
shopping carts handles

969
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:55,260
um

970
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:56,820
Ardent Advent says all the things we

971
00:40:55,260 --> 00:41:00,260
don't even think about thank you for

972
00:40:56,820 --> 00:41:00,260
bringing awareness you're welcome

973
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:05,280
basic contact with shopping cart handles

974
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:08,300
shopping cart handles are a big one

975
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,300
that's a big one

976
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:16,400
if I have to grab a sharping a shopping

977
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:16,400
cart handle sorry

978
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:21,660
Linda kluskey says

979
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:24,000
so the point of this is to let everyone

980
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:25,680
know that no matter how healthy pure

981
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,540
they think they are we all have

982
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:29,820
Pharmaceuticals in our bodies yes so I

983
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:32,579
would love to do something for people I

984
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:35,160
would love to know they have tools

985
00:41:32,579 --> 00:41:36,660
so they can help themselves protect

986
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:38,839
themselves defend themselves and so

987
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,839
forth

988
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:49,380
basic contact with shopping cart handles

989
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:51,900
is another surprising source of exposure

990
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:54,000
because those handles are

991
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:57,180
where a lot of pharmaceutical residue

992
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:59,280
resides not just bacteria and viruses

993
00:41:57,180 --> 00:42:01,980
and herpes and everything else that's on

994
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:05,460
those shopping cart handles I take an

995
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:08,180
alcohol wipe and I wipe the handle with

996
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:08,180
an alcoholic

997
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:16,680
often from pharmaceutical creams

998
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:18,000
and sweat from individuals Palms so what

999
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:20,000
I don't like about the shopping cart

1000
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,440
handles is because

1001
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,420
Pharmaceuticals come out of people's

1002
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:27,300
Palms

1003
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:28,619
their sweat from their palms they start

1004
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:30,980
holding the handles and pushing the

1005
00:42:28,619 --> 00:42:30,980
handle through

1006
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:35,700
which contain pharmaceutical residue if

1007
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:37,500
they're on medication

1008
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:40,619
all right you guys want me to read a

1009
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:42,500
little bit more we okay

1010
00:42:40,619 --> 00:42:46,520
foreign

1011
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:46,520
Pharmaceuticals and our brain

1012
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:52,740
Pharmaceuticals are manufactured to

1013
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:56,040
affect the brain or body in specific

1014
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:57,960
ways generally stimulating or

1015
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:59,819
suppressing certain neurological or body

1016
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:02,280
processes

1017
00:42:59,819 --> 00:43:04,380
so when you take a medication it could

1018
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:06,180
very well be for the purpose of trying

1019
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:07,859
to enhance or subdue particular

1020
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:09,359
functions of the brain

1021
00:43:07,859 --> 00:43:11,460
at the same time you know like

1022
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:14,780
antidepressants any

1023
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:17,420
uh any anti-anxiety meds

1024
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:19,680
benzodiazepines right at the same time

1025
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:21,960
Pharmaceuticals can affect the functions

1026
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:23,940
of the brain in ways that aren't always

1027
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:26,940
ideal

1028
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:28,859
metal says I'm not an animal eater but

1029
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:33,500
does this apply to the Kosher meat

1030
00:43:28,859 --> 00:43:33,500
industrial industry too yes it does

1031
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:38,359
see

1032
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:43,020
there are side effects sometimes

1033
00:43:40,859 --> 00:43:44,880
debilitating and life-altering and even

1034
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:46,260
creating a dependency that outweighs the

1035
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,880
original problem for which the person

1036
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:50,460
took the medication for so we all know

1037
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:52,440
that a lot of medications prescribed for

1038
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:53,700
people for their brains

1039
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:56,000
because their brains aren't working

1040
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:56,000
right

1041
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:03,619
but then a dependency happens and then

1042
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:03,619
the problem can worsen and so forth

1043
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:08,280
and that dependency outweighs the

1044
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:11,240
original problem the person even took

1045
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:11,240
the medication for right

1046
00:44:11,339 --> 00:44:17,099
medications can be in general toxic to

1047
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:18,180
all areas of the brain here's how it

1048
00:44:17,099 --> 00:44:21,300
works

1049
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:22,440
some on page 201 a brain saver just want

1050
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:24,420
to give you a little run down here

1051
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:27,480
before I go any further

1052
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:30,180
new people that popped on here okay two

1053
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:32,819
best books right now hands down

1054
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:35,160
in health history I can say that because

1055
00:44:32,819 --> 00:44:36,900
I can judge these books I'm allowed to

1056
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:40,319
judge it myself and have an opinion on

1057
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:43,740
these books best books

1058
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:46,339
hands down greatest books of all time

1059
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:46,339
in history

1060
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:51,480
letting you know

1061
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:53,880
Miramar says I was going I was going to

1062
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:56,579
make this today now let's see wait

1063
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:58,980
I wasn't gonna make this today I thought

1064
00:44:56,579 --> 00:45:01,140
I didn't need it now I'm making both for

1065
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:03,599
me and my daughter

1066
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:06,980
pharmaceutical exposure shot

1067
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:06,980
that's what marama is talking about

1068
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:11,880
hands down the best books

1069
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:14,280
truly and you'll know it when you read

1070
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:16,260
them I can judge him because the

1071
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:18,180
information came from above it wasn't

1072
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:20,400
I'm not being biased it came from above

1073
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:22,619
if I don't like it I can say I don't

1074
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:24,300
like it but they're incredible

1075
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:25,740
okay

1076
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:27,900
um

1077
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:30,780
Char dream says what if you have to take

1078
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:33,119
medications to live it's fine of course

1079
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:34,319
this isn't this isn't about stopping

1080
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:36,240
your medications if you're on your

1081
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:38,520
medications

1082
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:39,359
no this is about pharmaceutical exposure

1083
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:42,900
shots

1084
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:44,819
which means yeah you can take the book

1085
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:46,500
to your doctor or doctor can I take the

1086
00:45:44,819 --> 00:45:47,940
pharmaceutical exposure shot

1087
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:50,880
it's apples

1088
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:54,060
it's lemons it's cilantro it's onion

1089
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:57,980
it's limes it's asparagus it's lemons I

1090
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:57,980
said that right can I take the shot

1091
00:45:58,220 --> 00:46:01,800
foreign

1092
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:04,400
pharmaceutical shot is for recent

1093
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,400
exposure

1094
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:08,940
which is incredible

1095
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:11,280
and other medical medium information and

1096
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:13,440
stuff is from for past exposure but I

1097
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:15,060
like the pharmaceutical shot also for

1098
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:17,160
some past exposure too because past

1099
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:18,900
exposure can Leach out of our liver and

1100
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:22,520
become recent exposure so I like the

1101
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:22,520
Pharmaceuticals shop for that

1102
00:46:23,099 --> 00:46:26,960
okay

1103
00:46:24,839 --> 00:46:26,960
um

1104
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:30,839
I'd like to read a little bit more if we

1105
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:33,839
can

1106
00:46:30,839 --> 00:46:36,180
let's see Polly Wren says Anthony I love

1107
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:38,099
your life so so much

1108
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:41,760
especially this brain shot challenge

1109
00:46:38,099 --> 00:46:43,980
Hearts I prayed to catch this today

1110
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:46,200
because the timing usually clashes with

1111
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:48,839
my kids

1112
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:50,880
with my kids bedtime and here I am yes

1113
00:46:48,839 --> 00:46:53,819
and yes you are and this is an amazing

1114
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:55,380
Live two-day talk about pharmaceutical

1115
00:46:53,819 --> 00:46:58,819
stuff which is always fun to talk about

1116
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:58,819
I mean come on it is right

1117
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:06,660
okay medications can be in general toxic

1118
00:47:04,859 --> 00:47:08,400
to all areas of the brain here's how it

1119
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:11,540
works

1120
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:11,540
he's got a brain over here

1121
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:17,119
excuse me guys I might have to take my

1122
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:17,119
Pharmaceuticals right now

1123
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:21,920
um

1124
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:21,920
and nothing to drink them with

1125
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:24,920
you guys don't mind right

00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:30,900

juice or is that is that not good I'm

1128
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:33,500
gonna take away

1129
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:37,940
let me just take it with some water here

1130
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:47,940
oh

1131
00:47:43,319 --> 00:47:50,599
I'm joking that is an L-lysine capsule

1132
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:53,400
from vimergy my favorite company

1133
00:47:50,599 --> 00:47:55,619
vemergy.com he's in Victor i m e r g

1134
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:58,380
y.com I endorse these guys their stuff

1135
00:47:55,619 --> 00:48:03,440
is incredible and that is a lysine

1136
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:03,440
capsule licing capsule from beverages

1137
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:07,800
all right enough fooling around let's

1138
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:09,480
get down to it you guys

1139
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:12,839
here's how it works when a medication

1140
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:16,200
enters a person's body system the liver

1141
00:48:12,839 --> 00:48:18,960
absorbs some of it every time we take a

1142
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:21,660
medication the liver absorbs some of it

1143
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:23,460
right here the liver I haven't seen this

1144
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:25,200
guy in a long time I think it's been

1145
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:28,020
like a couple of years before he's

1146
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:29,579
before I've had him out here on the

1147
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:33,060
stage

1148
00:48:29,579 --> 00:48:34,619
okay your liver absorbs part of that

1149
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:37,040
medication every time you have a

1150
00:48:34,619 --> 00:48:37,040
medication

1151
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:41,880
much of that medication enters the

1152
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:44,020
bloodstream directly

1153
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:46,440
bypassing the liver at first

1154
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:49,339
[Music]

1155
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:49,339
sound effects

1156
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:54,300
because some medications have an uncanny

1157
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:57,180
ability to absorb into your bloodstream

1158
00:48:54,300 --> 00:49:00,420
through your mouth medications can

1159
00:48:57,180 --> 00:49:01,560
absorb through the mouth in through the

1160
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:03,900
throat

1161
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:05,819
esophagus

1162
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:08,579
stomach

1163
00:49:05,819 --> 00:49:10,980
duodenum

1164
00:49:08,579 --> 00:49:13,380
when medications find their way as far

1165
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:15,119
as the small intestinal tract that's

1166
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:17,760
when they find their way into the lining

1167
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:20,040
of the track and eventually into the

1168
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:23,300
hepatic portal vein and where does that

1169
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:23,300
go up to your liver

1170
00:49:23,819 --> 00:49:29,760
even medications that bypass the liver

1171
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:31,800
at first eventually find their way there

1172
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:34,440
through the bloodstream so even a

1173
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:36,660
medication that absorbs here boom

1174
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:39,780
absorbs through here here esophagus

1175
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:42,200
stomach duodenum still find their way to

1176
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:42,200
the liver

1177
00:49:42,599 --> 00:49:47,819
when the liver absorbs the medications

1178
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:49,619
as part of its bloodstream cleanup the

1179
00:49:47,819 --> 00:49:52,319
kidneys aren't the only part of the

1180
00:49:49,619 --> 00:49:56,540
blood cleanup equation

1181
00:49:52,319 --> 00:49:56,540
the liver is doing blood clean up

1182
00:49:58,020 --> 00:50:02,160

00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:59,339
medium doesn't talk enough about

1211
00:50:57,059 --> 00:51:01,740
lymphatic system lymphatic system that's

1212
00:50:59,339 --> 00:51:03,960

you don't take care of your liver

1220
00:51:20,339 --> 00:51:25,079

1221
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:27,240
be filled with all the time your

1222
00:51:25,079 --> 00:51:29,940
lymphatic system is going to be drowning

1223
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:31,920
in garbage if you don't take care of

1224
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:34,020
your liver your lymphatic system is

1225
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:37,680
going to be drowning the medical medium

1226
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:40,020
cleanses and Protocols are pro-lymphatic

1227
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:42,420
system because it's taking care of the

1228
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:44,040
liver it automatically takes care of the

1229
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:45,720
lymphatic system but you'll find

1230
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:48,119
influencers goes he doesn't do anything

1231
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:49,380
about the lymphatics are you kidding me

1232
00:51:48,119 --> 00:51:51,780

1233
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:55,280
kidneys like what if you don't take care

1234
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:55,280
of your liver

1235
00:51:55,319 --> 00:51:59,300
then forget your kidneys

1236
00:52:00,059 --> 00:52:05,520
they don't know what does what they just

1237
00:52:03,059 --> 00:52:07,800
say lymphatic system or or kidney so

1238
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:10,500
they can sell you a product

1239
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:12,540
that's an affiliate product

1240
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:14,280
coming from another place in another

1241
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:15,900
place that convinces all these young

1242
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:18,839
influencers oh you've got to get your

1243
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:20,400
lymphatic systems what if you don't take

1244
00:52:18,839 --> 00:52:22,140
care of your liver or understand your

1245
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:23,760
liver you're never going to take care of

1246
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:25,800
your lymphatic system I don't care how

1247
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:27,480
many lymphatic drainage massages you get

1248
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:29,579
you can't take care of your lymphatic

1249
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:33,440
system if you don't take care of your

1250
00:52:29,579 --> 00:52:33,440
liver that's just the bottom line

1251
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:37,619
it is for your lymphatic system that's

1252
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:40,040
what all this is for they just don't

1253
00:52:37,619 --> 00:52:40,040
know it

1254
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:48,900
anyway

1255
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:50,700
okay I had to get one rant in today

1256
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:53,540
so let's let's move on to the

1257
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:53,540
medications

1258
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:58,920
when the medication is out of your

1259
00:52:55,920 --> 00:53:01,200
bloodstream it's living somewhere else

1260
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:02,880
such a stored deep inside the liver

1261
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:05,099
where the medication is then Time

1262
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:07,920
released back into the bloodstream for

1263
00:53:05,099 --> 00:53:10,440
future years to come inevitably a

1264
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:14,220
stagnant sluggish liver with a storage

1265
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:16,500
bin of old Pharmaceuticals has to pop a

1266
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:18,480
cork every so often

1267
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:20,280
so if we don't take care of our liver it

1268
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:23,280
pops a cork and then our lymphatic

1269
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:26,099
system takes a hit

1270
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:28,980
releasing residues they find their way

1271
00:53:26,099 --> 00:53:30,359
to the brain eventually if someone's not

1272
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:33,480
cleansing

1273
00:53:30,359 --> 00:53:35,520
then all that Gunk is just going to the

1274
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:37,559
brain

1275
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:40,800
you can squeeze your lymphatic system

1276
00:53:37,559 --> 00:53:43,920
all you want if you don't

1277
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:46,140
clean up the liver

1278
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:48,420
then you don't stand a chance of keeping

1279
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:51,020
your lymphatic system clean

1280
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:51,020
oops

1281
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:55,440
they still say this is for your

1282
00:53:53,099 --> 00:53:58,559
lymphatic system so do do this product

1283
00:53:55,440 --> 00:54:00,240

1284
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:02,640
it does in your body which they don't

1285
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:04,619
even know it's all a scam anyone can

1286
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:06,420
sense like scam scam scam everywhere

1287
00:54:04,619 --> 00:54:07,920
it's for your lymphatic system this is

1288
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:09,119
for your kidneys here's a product for

1289

your kidneys here's your product for

1290

your lymphatic system

1291

but they don't even actually know what

1292
00:54:12,839 --> 00:54:15,800
does what or what

1293
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:23,160
the liver is up against a lot when we

1294
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:25,559
don't know how to care for it so it

1295
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:29,099
can't hold on to every brain betrayer

1296
00:54:25,559 --> 00:54:31,380
forever which is Pharmaceuticals example

1297
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:33,300
as the liver gets over saturated with

1298
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:35,700
various cocktails of medications you

1299
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:37,619
might have taken along the way or taken

1300
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:41,460
long term including over-the-counter

1301
00:54:37,619 --> 00:54:44,220
medications it starts letting go of some

1302
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:47,780
of those medications liver starts to let

1303
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:47,780
go of some of those meds

1304
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:55,500
they circulate throughout the

1305
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:57,660
bloodstream again and again and they

1306
00:54:55,500 --> 00:55:00,180
find their way back to the brain no

1307
00:54:57,660 --> 00:55:02,760
longer just affecting The receptors the

1308
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:05,280
medications were originally intended for

1309
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:08,460
the longer the meditation the meditation

1310
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:10,859
is Fun the longer the meditation stay in

1311
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:15,180
the body the more

1312
00:55:10,859 --> 00:55:17,460
efficacy the medications lose

1313
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:19,319
for their intended purpose so what

1314
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:20,940
happens is all the med just stay in our

1315
00:55:19,319 --> 00:55:23,520
body and they don't even work anymore

1316
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:25,859
for their intended purpose now the

1317
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:27,660
pharmaceutical Brew can act as a toxic

1318
00:55:25,859 --> 00:55:30,119
substance

1319
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:33,660
to the brain overall

1320
00:55:30,119 --> 00:55:36,240
on IG Hillary thank you aw for helping

1321
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:40,579
me save money and not by trendy fad

1322
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:40,579
items that don't help the root problem

1323
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:46,980
and boy

1324
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:49,859
boy oh boy oh boy

1325
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:52,079
that's why I'm not like so much by so

1326
00:55:49,859 --> 00:55:54,359
many people creating hit pieces is

1327
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:56,220
because if you tell the truth about an

1328
00:55:54,359 --> 00:55:58,140
ionizer water machine or you tell the

1329
00:55:56,220 --> 00:56:00,720
truth about

1330
00:55:58,140 --> 00:56:02,040
whatever Pearl powder Shiloh G charcoal

1331
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:04,380
whatever you want us to call I mean

1332
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:06,300
people get angry as

1333
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:08,460
angry Infinite Wellness says my

1334
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:10,920
lymphatic system was drowning until I

1335
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:13,020
found you and healed

1336
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:15,480
foreign

1337
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:18,000
plus Pharmaceuticals contain toxic heavy

1338
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:21,000
metals Pharmaceuticals also contain

1339
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:23,160
caffeine these additives are part of how

1340
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,720
medications affect the brain so potently

1341
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:27,000
because there's Metals in

1342
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:28,740
Pharmaceuticals and caffeine in

1343
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:31,099
Pharmaceuticals and they get to your

1344
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:31,099
brain

1345
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:36,780
medications of any kind whether intended

1346
00:56:34,619 --> 00:56:38,579
for the brain or elsewhere have the

1347
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:40,619
ability to get past the blood-brain

1348
00:56:38,579 --> 00:56:43,260
barrier and enter every part of the

1349
00:56:40,619 --> 00:56:45,839
brain because Pharmaceuticals are tissue

1350
00:56:43,260 --> 00:56:48,540
soluble how's that word how do you

1351
00:56:45,839 --> 00:56:51,540
pronounce that word soluble

1352
00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:51,540
cellulable

1353
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:57,359
soluble

1354
00:56:54,359 --> 00:56:59,280
I'm not a scholar I'm not an academic

1355
00:56:57,359 --> 00:57:01,619
I'm a messenger that writes word for

1356
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:04,140
word from Spirit of compassion doesn't

1357
00:57:01,619 --> 00:57:06,660
mean I'm the best reader

1358
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:10,800
there's no part of the brain that's

1359
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:12,660
immune or unexposed medication also gets

1360
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:15,540
stuck in the brain

1361
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:17,099
in which case it doesn't get time

1362
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:19,800
released

1363
00:57:17,099 --> 00:57:21,240
it stays there indefinitely okay so what

1364
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:22,980
this is saying right here is what Spirit

1365
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:24,780
fashion was saying that these meds get

1366
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:26,940
stuck on our brain and they're not Time

1367
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:28,740
released in the brain out of the brain

1368
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:32,099
they're Time released out of the liver

1369
00:57:28,740 --> 00:57:33,720
so liver will pop a cork and let some of

1370
00:57:32,099 --> 00:57:36,359
that out all the time but the brain

1371
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:38,819
won't pop a cork and let the meds out

1372
00:57:36,359 --> 00:57:42,680
they saturate the brain unless we work

1373
00:57:38,819 --> 00:57:42,680
on getting them out with tools

1374
00:57:44,579 --> 00:57:50,220
these toxins stay definitely raising

1375
00:57:48,059 --> 00:57:52,079
toxicity levels within the brain tissue

1376
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:53,819
slowly denaturing brain cells and then

1377
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:56,220
never leaving the brain until someone

1378
00:57:53,819 --> 00:57:58,319
learns how to actively and proactively

1379
00:57:56,220 --> 00:58:02,599
work to clean it out of the brain tissue

1380
00:57:58,319 --> 00:58:02,599
and that's why people can go mad

1381
00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:06,140
just all that stuff just building up in

1382
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:09,559
their brain

1383
00:58:06,140 --> 00:58:09,559
it's terrible

1384
00:58:09,839 --> 00:58:14,640
for more information

1385
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:17,579
on how recreational drugs can affect our

1386
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:19,619
brain see chapter 11 micro dosing I had

1387
00:58:17,579 --> 00:58:22,260
to read that little part

1388
00:58:19,619 --> 00:58:24,960
some medications can be useful in crisis

1389
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:26,760
situations such as injuries or severe

1390
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:28,680
infections I love how they're trying to

1391
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:30,839
make micro dosing so hip and trendy it's

1392
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:32,160
unbelievable and it's I notice

1393
00:58:30,839 --> 00:58:36,000
that

1394
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:39,000
it's like ridiculous too it's like

1395
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:40,799
it's like preying on kids now for real

1396
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:44,339
the micro dosing thing is preying on

1397
00:58:40,799 --> 00:58:47,040
kids now because you got all these

1398
00:58:44,339 --> 00:58:49,140
young people that have brain problems

1399
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:50,760
they got brain fatigue they got brain

1400
00:58:49,140 --> 00:58:53,640
fog they got folks in concentration

1401
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:54,839
issues and then you tell these young

1402
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:57,359
people

1403
00:58:54,839 --> 00:58:58,619
about microdosing psychedelics and

1404
00:58:57,359 --> 00:59:00,960
everything else

1405
00:58:58,619 --> 00:59:03,180
and you know it hits that science-minded

1406
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:05,460
thing like micro dosing it must be

1407
00:59:03,180 --> 00:59:07,319
science proven there must be people who

1408
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:09,119
have done you know just right they know

1409
00:59:07,319 --> 00:59:10,799
what's going on it's a micro dosing

1410
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:12,119
culture that's starting up is actually

1411
00:59:10,799 --> 00:59:15,900
insane

1412
00:59:12,119 --> 00:59:17,819
Colleen bloomhuff I'm soaking in water

1413
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:20,040
that's connected to the ionizer machine

1414
00:59:17,819 --> 00:59:23,760
I thought it cleanses the lymph system

1415
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:25,619
and heavy metals out of the body Colleen

1416
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:27,599
you can do what you want and do what

1417
00:59:25,619 --> 00:59:29,400
your doctor tells you but I'm going to

1418
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:30,780
tell you my

1419
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:33,480
my

1420
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:37,740
thoughts okay

1421
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:39,420
alkaline ionizer water machines are one

1422
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:41,520
of the greatest scams of all time

1423
00:59:39,420 --> 00:59:43,319
there's a lot of great scams and that's

1424
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:47,240
one of them

1425
00:59:43,319 --> 00:59:47,240
those metal plates corrode

1426
00:59:48,299 --> 00:59:52,619
and in the past before medical meme

1427
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:54,119
information got everywhere like it's

1428
00:59:52,619 --> 00:59:56,160
pretty much getting everywhere now where

1429
00:59:54,119 --> 00:59:57,540
people are actually like on all this B12

1430
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:58,740
and they're doing all these things now

1431
00:59:57,540 --> 01:00:00,540
and taking care of themselves all that's

1432
00:59:58,740 --> 01:00:03,540
been Pro medical meaning for for decades

1433
01:00:00,540 --> 01:00:06,119
right in the past when people were doing

1434
01:00:03,540 --> 01:00:07,500
the ionizer water machines they went

1435
01:00:06,119 --> 01:00:10,140
mental

1436
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:13,440
and got sicker

1437
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:16,380
because of the metal plates corroding

1438
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:18,480
is one of the greatest scams of all time

1439
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:20,400
one of them there's a bunch of them but

1440
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:23,000
that's definitely on the list

1441
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:23,000
it's terrible

1442
01:00:24,299 --> 01:00:27,780
and then people doing those machines and

1443
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:29,760
then blaming medical medium for getting

1444
01:00:27,780 --> 01:00:31,740
them sicker when they're drinking tons

1445
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:33,480
of that ionizer water that alkaline

1446
01:00:31,740 --> 01:00:35,339
ionized water and they're going to get

1447
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:38,280
so sick

1448
01:00:35,339 --> 01:00:40,500
their brains that's metal metal

1449
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:42,960
particles leaching out of those

1450
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:44,400
those plates with electric with

1451
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:47,460
electricity attached to those metal

1452
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:48,960
plates corroding them over time

1453
01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:52,700
insane

1454
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:52,700
that tips to scale the wrong way

1455
01:00:55,079 --> 01:00:57,980
it's exhausting

1456
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:02,160
been saying it for years some

1457
01:01:00,059 --> 01:01:04,440
medications can be useful in crisis

1458
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:05,940
situations this is interesting

1459
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:07,619
I've done water shows in the past

1460
01:01:05,940 --> 01:01:11,540
talking about this I'll do some things

1461
01:01:07,619 --> 01:01:11,540
again when I can

1462
01:01:13,140 --> 01:01:16,500
but right now we're in the 20-day

1463
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:19,880
medical meme brings out there big one

1464
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:19,880
challenge guess what it's free

1465
01:01:21,059 --> 01:01:26,760
so how to get your stuff

1466
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:29,099
get the book free at the library

1467
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:31,740
some medications can be useful in crisis

1468
01:01:29,099 --> 01:01:32,940
situations such as injuries or severe

1469
01:01:31,740 --> 01:01:36,000
infections

1470
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:39,359
I'm not anti-medication

1471
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:41,880
I am not anti-medication

1472
01:01:39,359 --> 01:01:44,240
for a lot of reasons some of it is

1473
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:44,240
useful

1474
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:48,900
there are times when they are truly

1475
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:51,119
necessary I say it here

1476
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:53,700
what we need to be aware of is how

1477
01:01:51,119 --> 01:01:55,440
long-term use of pharmaceuticals end up

1478
01:01:53,700 --> 01:01:57,299
saturating brain tissue and dampening

1479
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:59,700
the central nervous system's ability to

1480
01:01:57,299 --> 01:02:01,260
perform and we're not fixing the

1481
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:03,900
original problem we have to work on

1482
01:02:01,260 --> 01:02:05,700
fixing the original problem

1483
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:07,440
when we're not given answers from the

1484
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:09,299
medical industry about how to heal

1485
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:11,819
chronic illness

1486
01:02:09,299 --> 01:02:14,520
are symptoms and conditions continue far

1487
01:02:11,819 --> 01:02:17,280
too long and we may find ourselves on

1488
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:21,740
medications for extended periods and I'm

1489
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:21,740
not shaming blaming or judging anybody

1490
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:28,799
with the medications possibly making our

1491
01:02:26,220 --> 01:02:31,500
conditions worse on top of it medical

1492
01:02:28,799 --> 01:02:34,380
research and science don't even know

1493
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:35,579
what the cause of chronic illness is to

1494
01:02:34,380 --> 01:02:38,099
begin with

1495
01:02:35,579 --> 01:02:39,780
so they also don't realize they could be

1496
01:02:38,099 --> 01:02:41,400
making the condition worse from the

1497
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:43,799
medication

1498
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:45,960
one thing to keep in mind

1499
01:02:43,799 --> 01:02:47,700
is that sometimes multiple medications

1500
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:49,980
are prescribed by different doctors

1501
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:53,040
creating a stronger Brew than anyone

1502
01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:54,660
intended that can alter or hinder

1503
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:57,180
your brain's ability to function

1504
01:02:54,660 --> 01:03:00,059
optimally if you're actively relying on

1505
01:02:57,180 --> 01:03:03,119
medication I respect that

1506
01:03:00,059 --> 01:03:04,859
says it here I do you can still work on

1507
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:07,260
healing your brain and protecting it

1508
01:03:04,859 --> 01:03:08,700
from the dozens of other brain betrayers

1509
01:03:07,260 --> 01:03:11,000

let's get that in here

1585
01:07:40,980 --> 01:07:47,059
I don't think that's funny at all

1586
01:07:44,099 --> 01:07:47,059
half an apple

1587
01:07:50,039 --> 01:07:56,599
foreign

1588
01:07:52,220 --> 01:07:56,599
that's a really nice apple right there

1589
01:07:57,720 --> 01:08:01,160
this is going to be so good

1590
01:08:01,619 --> 01:08:06,599
I love the pharmaceutical

1591
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:08,039
exposure shot

1592
01:08:06,599 --> 01:08:09,720
a friend of mine said why are you taking

1593
01:08:08,039 --> 01:08:10,740
the pharmaceutical exposure shot like

1594
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:12,119
what's wrong with you are you on

1595
01:08:10,740 --> 01:08:14,339
Pharmaceuticals

1596
01:08:12,119 --> 01:08:17,520
no I'm not any I'm not on any

1597
01:08:14,339 --> 01:08:20,160
Pharmaceuticals no not on any it's

1598
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:24,060
taking the shot I said I don't know did

1599
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:28,160
you read the book it's a lot of exposure

1600
01:08:24,060 --> 01:08:28,160
there's so many Avenues of exposure

1601
01:08:30,299 --> 01:08:33,920
popping some apple in here

1602
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:38,299
we go

1603
01:08:40,799 --> 01:08:45,600
if you're new here and you don't know

1604
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:48,120
about the mm1500 or 900 it's 20 off

1605
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:50,160
right now but guess what

1606
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:51,779
that's not the special thing that's

1607
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:54,179
that's amazing

1608
01:08:51,779 --> 01:08:56,640
the special thing is

1609
01:08:54,179 --> 01:08:59,040
is the money saved

1610
01:08:56,640 --> 01:09:00,900
not because of the 20 off the money

1611
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:03,239
saved because of the fact that squeezes

1612
01:09:00,900 --> 01:09:05,339
so much juice out

1613
01:09:03,239 --> 01:09:07,140
and I endorse these guys because of it

1614
01:09:05,339 --> 01:09:09,600
because if it saves you money it saves

1615
01:09:07,140 --> 01:09:10,859
you money I love how the pulp comes out

1616
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:12,359
like this

1617
01:09:10,859 --> 01:09:16,380
right

1618
01:09:12,359 --> 01:09:17,580
I saw a comment on YouTube

1619
01:09:16,380 --> 01:09:20,520
um

1620
01:09:17,580 --> 01:09:24,660
I think it was legit was it Roseanne was

1621
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:24,660
it Rosanna I can't remember but

1622
01:09:25,199 --> 01:09:28,679
I think she was talking about how

1623
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:30,420
there's influencers out there pushing

1624
01:09:28,679 --> 01:09:32,400
the spinning basket one

1625
01:09:30,420 --> 01:09:35,759
yeah

1626
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:38,759
yeah totally the spinning basket one is

1627
01:09:35,759 --> 01:09:41,400
takes a lot of produce and you lose a

1628
01:09:38,759 --> 01:09:44,880
lot of produce and people aren't wealthy

1629
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:47,339
or Rich enough or have access to co-ops

1630
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:48,600
and access to infinite amounts of

1631
01:09:47,339 --> 01:09:49,739
produce coming their way where they

1632
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:50,940
could just keep on pushing it through

1633
01:09:49,739 --> 01:09:53,460
that machine

1634
01:09:50,940 --> 01:09:56,040
people who are chronically sick don't

1635
01:09:53,460 --> 01:09:58,260
have all that money to throw away so

1636
01:09:56,040 --> 01:10:00,840
that's what I love about the mm 1500 900

1637
01:09:58,260 --> 01:10:02,640
because it's squeezing more juice out of

1638
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:04,260
it that's the whole point and it's

1639
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:05,580
preserving the nutrients because it's a

1640
01:10:04,260 --> 01:10:07,560
cold pressed masticating machine because

1641
01:10:05,580 --> 01:10:09,060
when you're sick you need that when

1642
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:11,280
you're chronically sick you need a

1643
01:10:09,060 --> 01:10:12,660
medicine maker not a you know a

1644
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:14,520
flamboyant

1645
01:10:12,660 --> 01:10:16,860
spend a ton of money on produce every

1646
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:19,440
minute kind of machine

1647
01:10:16,860 --> 01:10:21,900
Carrie Pearson says the mm Omega juicers

1648
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:23,940
are the best save so much money and

1649
01:10:21,900 --> 01:10:25,500
you're saving money not just not just

1650
01:10:23,940 --> 01:10:26,280
because the discount right you're saving

1651
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:28,440
money

1652
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:31,199
because of the produce you're buying

1653
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:33,300
less produce oh my God

1654
01:10:31,199 --> 01:10:34,140
matters

1655
01:10:33,300 --> 01:10:36,860
yeah

1656
01:10:34,140 --> 01:10:36,860
all right

1657
01:10:37,620 --> 01:10:43,880
guess what

1658
01:10:40,199 --> 01:10:43,880
I got a shot glass right here

1659
01:10:44,340 --> 01:10:49,060
fantastic

1660
01:10:47,100 --> 01:10:58,140
I did something right

1661
01:10:49,060 --> 01:11:01,199
[Music]

1662
01:10:58,140 --> 01:11:03,840
see you later Pharmaceuticals

1663
01:11:01,199 --> 01:11:08,520
bye bye

1664
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:10,290
any recent exposure I may have had

1665
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:15,480
I'm kissing you goodbye

1666
01:11:10,290 --> 01:11:18,260
[Music]

1667
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:18,260
so good

1668
01:11:21,179 --> 01:11:26,100
it's incredible is you can sense how it

1669
01:11:23,820 --> 01:11:27,780
it actually can work

1670
01:11:26,100 --> 01:11:29,760
because I don't get experiences like

1671
01:11:27,780 --> 01:11:30,440
that when I just drink the juice the

1672
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:32,100
green juice

1673
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:35,340
[Music]

1674
01:11:32,100 --> 01:11:37,880
because it's about what it is the

1675
01:11:35,340 --> 01:11:40,440
phytochemical compounds working together

1676
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:43,020
we create so much

1677
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:47,340
destruction and Death on this planet

1678
01:11:43,020 --> 01:11:49,920
Earth so much toxic waste
