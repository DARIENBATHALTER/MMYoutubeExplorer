[0.00 - 11.00] [Music]
[9.12 - 14.70] find out what's making you sick and how
[11.00 - 15.88] to heal Anthony William is the medical
[14.70 - 18.60] [Music]
[15.88 - 20.40] medium hello I'm Anthony William the
[18.60 - 21.72] medical Medium you're listening to the
[20.40 - 23.04] medical medium radio show where each
[21.72 - 25.80] week I bring the most advanced
[23.04 - 28.20] information on health out there often
[25.80 - 30.00] ahead of what's out there now and I'm
[28.20 - 32.00] talking about conventional medicine too
[30.00 - 33.80] and alternative medicine research and
[32.00 - 37.08] science doesn't know a heck of a lot
[33.80 - 39.44] about guess what chronic illness don't
[37.08 - 40.76] get that confused with you know with
[39.44 - 42.00] other life-saving medicine and
[40.76 - 44.72] everything else that's involved in
[42.00 - 48.04] technology that's different this is why
[44.72 - 50.60] I often hear all the time young people
[48.04 - 52.84] who have been taught and conditioned
[50.60 - 55.48] that technology and science and research
[52.84 - 57.72] has it all down with everything in life
[55.48 - 59.52] they feel this safety they feel this
[57.72 - 60.96] this control and all of it and all of a
[59.52 - 62.80] sudden the the minute you get sick and
[60.96 - 65.16] you all of a sudden have things that
[62.80 - 67.72] just can't be explained by doctors or
[65.16 - 69.80] that can be but you can't get resolv and
[67.72 - 71.64] you're young it's an unbelievable
[69.80 - 73.20] mindblower I'm seeing it more and more I
[71.64 - 76.20] talk about this a lot now because I see
[73.20 - 77.96] it every day now and it's really sad
[76.20 - 80.56] back in the you know back years ago
[77.96 - 83.64] decades ago doing this you didn't see
[80.56 - 85.08] that as much but now we're just we're so
[83.64 - 87.36] conditioned that science and research
[85.08 - 89.20] knows everything about anything doesn't
[87.36 - 90.88] matter what it is just go you know what
[89.20 - 93.12] I mean just go to the doctor and if it's
[90.88 - 95.32] not a cold which is really there are no
[93.12 - 97.92] colds it's just flu there is no colds
[95.32 - 100.20] there are no colds the cold viruses are
[97.92 - 102.64] gone have been gone they've been killed
[100.20 - 104.16] off overshadowed by the flu the flu is
[102.64 - 105.68] what everybody gets some people get a
[104.16 - 106.96] mild rendition some people react
[105.68 - 108.44] differently some people get our worse
[106.96 - 110.44] flu there's different strains of flu
[108.44 - 112.56] that's just an example of what happens
[110.44 - 114.96] here and we call it cold which is
[112.56 - 117.56] actually not that's not how it works
[114.96 - 119.20] there are no colds it's all flu now and
[117.56 - 120.80] that's how it works when people get the
[119.20 - 122.44] sniffles oh you got the sniffles oh you
[120.80 - 125.20] got the sinuses and the congestion and a
[122.44 - 126.88] little cough that's the flu it always is
[125.20 - 128.40] and that's just a prime example of the
[126.88 - 131.28] misinformation out there that's really
[128.40 - 133.12] annoying but the point is if it's not
[131.28 - 134.68] just something like the flu and then you
[133.12 - 136.36] go and get an antibiotic for some kind
[134.68 - 138.60] of chest cold or something meaning like
[136.36 - 142.20] not chest cold you get some kind of like
[138.60 - 143.84] chest bronchial spasms and cough and
[142.20 - 145.64] everything else and you go to the doctor
[143.84 - 147.76] and you get an antibiotic or whatever it
[145.64 - 149.28] is you're on cough medicine and you just
[147.76 - 150.80] you know you get better from the flu or
[149.28 - 152.32] whatever even if the antibiotic didn't
[150.80 - 156.00] have a whole lot to do with it cuz flu
[152.32 - 158.12] are viral what happens is the whole deal
[156.00 - 161.16] what happens is you think they just got
[158.12 - 164.20] it all down you got it all down but it's
[161.16 - 166.80] not it's not reality it's not how it
[164.20 - 167.80] works it's unbelievable out there and so
[166.80 - 169.32] we're talking about chemical
[167.80 - 171.44] sensitivities and I'm drilling this home
[169.32 - 172.76] a little bit chemical sensitivities is
[171.44 - 174.04] what the show is about and I'm drilling
[172.76 - 175.84] this home a little bit because it's
[174.04 - 177.36] important to know this because people
[175.84 - 179.20] with chemical sensitivities exactly
[177.36 - 180.40] research in science they they're not
[179.20 - 182.20] they're not like
[180.40 - 184.24] they don't have it down with chemical
[182.20 - 187.80] sensitivities people suffer they suffer
[184.24 - 189.56] horribly terribly tremendously and and
[187.80 - 191.00] this is a prime example a whole another
[189.56 - 192.88] prime example and I'm not just talking
[191.00 - 194.44] about illnesses that have names that are
[192.88 - 197.36] common and everything else and that
[194.44 - 198.92] people have every day like excus rasis
[197.36 - 200.56] and Hashim Modas and everything else
[198.92 - 202.32] restri science don't even have those
[200.56 - 203.92] down either that's the whole point
[202.32 - 205.68] that's chronic illness that's how it is
[203.92 - 207.08] and it's always blamed on genes or your
[205.68 - 209.44] body attacking itself which is
[207.08 - 212.40] ridiculous cuz that's not how it works
[209.44 - 214.80] it's how the body works so if you're new
[212.40 - 216.56] to the show the information is Advanced
[214.80 - 219.08] it's way ahead of what's out there now
[216.56 - 220.64] it always has been and no one's talking
[219.08 - 221.60] about it you can go online you can do
[220.64 - 223.16] all this stuff you're not going to get
[221.60 - 225.40] the medical medium information anywhere
[223.16 - 227.40] else does it work put it this way
[225.40 - 229.40] Decades of people getting better and
[227.40 - 232.28] better and better just the celery juice
[229.40 - 234.44] alone is changing the world in health on
[232.28 - 236.32] all levels it's unbelievable and that
[234.44 - 238.20] came from medical medium so that the
[236.32 - 239.92] whole point is let's get all the other
[238.20 - 242.68] gems and jewels we're talking about
[239.92 - 245.24] rescue the book live a rescue this is a
[242.68 - 246.88] book of all books that I've ever done
[245.24 - 248.60] and and I say that because first of all
[246.88 - 250.48] it's so huge it's such a big book it's
[248.60 - 253.20] really intense it's packed it's
[250.48 - 255.76] jam-packed it's a really serious book
[253.20 - 257.36] and that's one thing all on its own and
[255.76 - 258.92] and and it's so packed with so many
[257.36 - 260.52] different conditions and illnesses and
[258.92 - 262.36] everything else to understand and the
[260.52 - 264.04] information about the liver and all that
[262.36 - 266.12] that everybody needs but it's not just
[264.04 - 267.36] that we're talking about CH chemical
[266.12 - 268.84] sensitivities which chemical
[267.36 - 270.28] sensitivities is there there's a little
[268.84 - 272.20] section in the book
[270.28 - 274.20] and it's important to know what's
[272.20 - 277.92] happening how it works and everything
[274.20 - 281.20] else around it very important show if
[277.92 - 283.28] you don't have a chemical sensitivity it
[281.20 - 287.44] doesn't mean you're not being affected
[283.28 - 290.76] by chemicals chemicals that research and
[287.44 - 291.80] science created funny how's that isn't
[290.76 - 294.92] that
[291.80 - 298.24] interesting research and science creates
[294.92 - 301.16] all kinds of bad things and nothing but
[298.24 - 303.60] bad things okay meaning like also some
[301.16 - 306.52] good things of course but lots of bad
[303.60 - 308.56] things chemical sensitivities well
[306.52 - 310.24] everything behind them including the
[308.56 - 311.76] chemicals that make people sensitive
[310.24 - 314.32] including basic chemicals that make
[311.76 - 316.00] people sensitive was some kind of
[314.32 - 318.04] research and science behind it that
[316.00 - 321.48] created it so it's just it's just
[318.04 - 324.24] amazing how it goes I mean right no
[321.48 - 326.72] irony I don't know I I definitely think
[324.24 - 328.48] it is I definitely think it is so let's
[326.72 - 330.08] go into chemical sensitivities this is a
[328.48 - 332.84] big deal Big Show I'll tell you why
[330.08 - 334.36] because people suffer they suffer with
[332.84 - 337.88] these chemical sensitivities and I think
[334.36 - 339.88] we have to be more more sympathetic I
[337.88 - 342.44] think we have to be more compassionate
[339.88 - 344.36] actually about it chemical sensitivities
[342.44 - 347.20] are so frustrating for people who deal
[344.36 - 349.56] with them it's no joke part of it is
[347.20 - 352.48] physical suffering the physical
[349.56 - 354.80] suffering is uh is extraordinary it's
[352.48 - 358.48] really really difficult that's a big
[354.80 - 362.08] part of it okay the other part is an
[358.48 - 364.16] unsym athetic World an
[362.08 - 365.68] unsympathetic world that's the other
[364.16 - 369.08] part of chemical sensitivities that I
[365.68 - 371.44] don't like the average person who's
[369.08 - 375.32] never had to deal with a sensitivity
[371.44 - 379.60] will view someone with sensitivities as
[375.32 - 381.76] probably bat crap crazy most likely
[379.60 - 384.44] that's what they would probably view
[381.76 - 387.28] somebody like that or an ultimate
[384.44 - 391.08] hypercondriac or Stark crazy or
[387.28 - 393.20] something um so you yeah and that's
[391.08 - 396.28] really hard I mean it's really hard it
[393.20 - 398.28] really is unless there's this visible
[396.28 - 400.24] allergic reaction unless it's like
[398.28 - 401.84] somebody with a peanut allergy goes an
[400.24 - 403.76] athlectic shock and they have to use you
[401.84 - 405.20] know an EpiPen or whatever it is and you
[403.76 - 406.72] know meaning whatever because there's
[405.20 - 408.28] different kinds of there's different
[406.72 - 409.68] kinds of injectors and different kinds
[408.28 - 411.24] of um things that are out there being
[409.68 - 412.92] offered right now thanks to science
[411.24 - 416.36] exactly some of the good stuff to save
[412.92 - 418.36] people's lives but peanut allergies in
[416.36 - 421.08] general kind of came about because of
[418.36 - 423.24] science and research too
[421.08 - 425.76] so that's a whole another thing but uh
[423.24 - 427.72] we can talk about that another time so
[425.76 - 429.80] here's the deal it's yeah it's exactly
[427.72 - 432.28] it's almost like oh here's a remedy not
[429.80 - 435.36] a cure but here's a remedy to something
[432.28 - 437.80] we created we created the the the peanut
[435.36 - 439.48] allergies literally not the peanuts but
[437.80 - 440.64] the science of research created it I
[439.48 - 443.04] want to talk about it a little bit I
[440.64 - 446.08] can't help it and yet we don't have a
[443.04 - 448.20] cure for what we created classic classic
[446.08 - 451.16] so here's a remedy to try to get you out
[448.20 - 454.64] of like you know total total um you know
[451.16 - 457.48] epilc shock so that's the whole bit so
[454.64 - 459.00] anyway usually people who if it's not
[457.48 - 460.56] something like that people think you're
[459.00 - 462.08] crazy if it's not something where you
[460.56 - 464.88] know you got close throats blocking the
[462.08 - 468.40] Airways and it's hard it's hard for an
[464.88 - 470.44] observer to think that there's anything
[468.40 - 473.20] you know valid
[470.44 - 475.40] validation about chemical sensitivities
[473.20 - 476.96] right it's hard for anybody to take it
[475.40 - 480.24] seriously it's hard for anybody to
[476.96 - 481.44] actually care enough too really
[480.24 - 483.12] difficult that's where I'm talking about
[481.44 - 485.68] the unsympathetic world doesn't mean
[483.12 - 487.92] someone's not a good person and they
[485.68 - 490.12] just don't care it's that's not it it's
[487.92 - 491.76] just it's just people don't care I mean
[490.12 - 494.96] I don't know what else to say I mean
[491.76 - 496.92] right so that's just one thing chemical
[494.96 - 500.68] sensitivity
[496.92 - 501.96] suffers reactions are very they're very
[500.68 - 503.92] often
[501.96 - 505.56] invisible that's what I'm trying to get
[503.92 - 508.32] at here
[505.56 - 510.92] invisible very important invisible to
[508.32 - 514.32] the outside eye making it
[510.92 - 517.24] challenging for people to find Advocates
[514.32 - 519.52] making it challenging instead they're
[517.24 - 521.56] often told that they're making up their
[519.52 - 523.76] sensitivities you know looking for
[521.56 - 526.88] attention that's brutal I mean that's
[523.76 - 529.24] brutal seriously or that it's
[526.88 - 531.64] psychological maybe see a psychiatrist
[529.24 - 535.60] see a shrink see whatever they maybe
[531.64 - 538.00] treat it with an ey roll right the eye
[535.60 - 539.92] roll I just did one just now and they
[538.00 - 541.92] may be treated like that I do that for
[539.92 - 543.52] research in science with chronic illness
[541.92 - 546.12] I always do that the eye roll like oh
[543.52 - 548.72] here we go get another bogus another B
[546.12 - 550.72] bogus junk crap study that's just backed
[548.72 - 552.72] by investors to make something try to
[550.72 - 554.84] have an outcome and just whatever put
[552.72 - 556.76] the thumb on the scale and you know when
[554.84 - 558.28] it comes an a chronic illness and
[556.76 - 561.92] whatever it's just it's unbelievable I
[558.28 - 563.76] do the eye roll all the time and and so
[561.92 - 565.92] what happens is people do the ey roll to
[563.76 - 567.76] chemical sensitive he sufferers and then
[565.92 - 571.60] they may be told that they're
[567.76 - 574.84] attracting their chemical sensitivity my
[571.60 - 577.24] favorite annoyance of all is they may be
[574.84 - 580.12] told that they're creating it
[577.24 - 582.92] manifesting it yes you want to manifest
[580.12 - 585.00] good things you do it's not a bad word
[582.92 - 587.88] you want to do the best you can in every
[585.00 - 590.12] way to generate the best you can to you
[587.88 - 592.28] good energy absolutely you better
[590.12 - 595.80] believe it good spiritual energy good
[592.28 - 598.60] everything but but seriously it gets
[595.80 - 600.36] used against anybody who has a hard time
[598.60 - 602.44] not the part part that the word is there
[600.36 - 604.68] not the part that the that the you know
[602.44 - 606.08] the it's popular or trending whatever it
[604.68 - 607.36] is everybody's trying to manifest
[606.08 - 609.88] something that's not it that that
[607.36 - 612.60] doesn't bother me what bothers me it's
[609.88 - 614.92] it's it gets used against anybody who
[612.60 - 616.40] has a hard time anybody who's doing good
[614.92 - 618.52] should manifesting good stuff they're
[616.40 - 621.00] all just the manifestation is working
[618.52 - 622.56] anybody who's going through a hard time
[621.00 - 624.08] you know you say you got a yoga studio
[622.56 - 625.12] and you got 50 people in the yoga studio
[624.08 - 626.64] and there's everybody's trying to
[625.12 - 629.16] manifest something but if someone's
[626.64 - 631.64] having terrible luck if someone's having
[629.16 - 633.96] bad luck you know or someone's having
[631.64 - 635.52] some difficult time yeah people are just
[633.96 - 637.48] be like you're just not manifesting
[635.52 - 638.96] right you're not you're not Greatful
[637.48 - 640.56] you're not manifesting right and what
[638.96 - 642.12] happens is it gets thrown on to people
[640.56 - 644.36] chemical sensitivities you're not
[642.12 - 646.36] manifesting you know whatever and you're
[644.36 - 648.36] just you're just emotional what whatever
[646.36 - 650.52] it is it's just not healthy I don't find
[648.36 - 652.72] it healthy and creating your own illness
[650.52 - 655.48] is a big topic I put in thyroid healing
[652.72 - 656.72] for a reason because it's that obnoxious
[655.48 - 658.24] because people think they're be they're
[656.72 - 659.88] being told they think they're creating
[658.24 - 661.76] their own illness and let me tell you
[659.88 - 663.72] something that might be okay for
[661.76 - 666.12] somebody who's 40 to think they could
[663.72 - 667.72] probably handle handle it okay but when
[666.12 - 670.08] you got somebody who's 15 and they think
[667.72 - 671.88] they're manifesting their their illness
[670.08 - 673.48] and you got somebody who's 14 or you got
[671.88 - 674.52] somebody who's 19 and they're looking
[673.48 - 676.00] into things and they think they're
[674.52 - 678.32] manifesting their bad luck or their
[676.00 - 680.36] illness or their or their or their
[678.32 - 683.68] adversity it's
[680.36 - 685.52] disastrous on a level you can't
[683.68 - 689.24] imagine
[685.52 - 691.32] disastrous it can tank someone it can
[689.24 - 694.72] really get them to do something
[691.32 - 697.28] absolutely stupid out of that alone not
[694.72 - 699.44] good and not healthy I'm not I'm not
[697.28 - 701.40] kidding around same same with somebody
[699.44 - 703.48] who's in their 20s they think they're
[701.40 - 705.36] not manifesting the right you're such a
[703.48 - 707.40] like a vulnerable age everything about
[705.36 - 709.20] it and if you think you're the cause of
[707.40 - 711.12] why you got something going down like
[709.20 - 713.88] that because you're picking up on that
[711.12 - 716.32] whole manifestation thing it could be
[713.88 - 718.16] damaging it's cute for the 40-year-olds
[716.32 - 719.80] 50y olds whatever they can kind of shrug
[718.16 - 721.68] it and move past and if it's working not
[719.80 - 723.20] working how they feel whatever I'm going
[721.68 - 724.64] about the manifestation thing a little
[723.20 - 726.04] bit too long I know and I'm going into
[724.64 - 728.08] it a little bit but I have to because
[726.04 - 730.52] I'm going to tell you right now chemical
[728.08 - 732.72] sensitivity people they've been told
[730.52 - 735.08] they're manifesting their problem
[732.72 - 736.92] because they're told that a the problem
[735.08 - 738.08] is not real B if their problem is real
[736.92 - 740.80] and it's considered it then it's
[738.08 - 742.44] something they're doing wrong because
[740.80 - 743.88] there's no answers once again for
[742.44 - 745.80] research and science about chemical
[743.88 - 749.60] sensitivities anything there's no real
[745.80 - 751.08] answers for it it it's it's it's it just
[749.60 - 752.88] becomes like this that's why I'm going
[751.08 - 754.76] into this a little bit I had somebody
[752.88 - 756.52] personally who you know who came to me
[754.76 - 759.52] and they said look I'm I'm thinking
[756.52 - 761.28] about I'm thinking about just giving up
[759.52 - 763.76] giving up because I'm obviously
[761.28 - 765.20] manifesting it all wrong and and I don't
[763.76 - 766.84] know what to do to fix it because I
[765.20 - 768.08] still have problems coming my way and
[766.84 - 769.68] I'm trying to deal with them and I got
[768.08 - 771.52] the chemical sensitivities and I got
[769.68 - 773.28] this and I got that I got this mold
[771.52 - 774.92] problem in my house I got major chemical
[773.28 - 776.64] sensitivities I got all this other stuff
[774.92 - 778.28] I've been I've spent all my money I've
[776.64 - 780.76] completely exhausted myself on all
[778.28 - 782.92] levels and I'm just literally at the end
[780.76 - 784.88] of my rope and I said just just just
[782.92 - 786.68] forget the concern just forget the
[784.88 - 788.36] manifestation thing just move that out
[786.68 - 791.16] of your way you didn't create anything
[788.36 - 792.56] you're not you're not manifesta things
[791.16 - 795.52] the wrong way I said it's chemical
[792.56 - 798.00] sensitive person it saved their life
[795.52 - 801.92] they were literally contemplating
[798.00 - 805.12] something grave and it saved their life
[801.92 - 808.04] I'm just telling you right now okay it's
[805.12 - 809.84] saved their life I've seen it happen
[808.04 - 812.16] more than once where lives have been
[809.84 - 814.32] saved by moving that aside moving that
[812.16 - 815.88] over and saying here's the real problem
[814.32 - 817.44] and here's what's really going on and
[815.88 - 818.60] we're going to actually work on it and
[817.44 - 820.56] we're going to get you in the right
[818.60 - 822.68] place there are real answers there are
[820.56 - 825.52] real causes just hang in there it's
[822.68 - 828.12] going to be okay compassion compassion
[825.52 - 830.84] compassion manifesting isn't about
[828.12 - 835.24] compassion okay move on move
[830.84 - 837.32] on and is that important so what we
[835.24 - 839.32] really need is to do is to find
[837.32 - 840.96] compassion the people who deal with
[839.32 - 843.20] chemical sensitivities and other chronic
[840.96 - 847.20] illnesses we need compassion for we have
[843.20 - 851.92] to dig it out of us in any way we can
[847.20 - 854.24] for others in any way we can somehow we
[851.92 - 856.96] have to find it we got to dig it out and
[854.24 - 858.24] we have to make it happen okay there's
[856.96 - 859.44] nothing wrong with that there's nothing
[858.24 - 861.60] wrong about being positive there's
[859.44 - 863.48] nothing wrong with trying to create your
[861.60 - 865.80] life in every way and your destiny and
[863.48 - 867.56] controlling it and all that everything
[865.80 - 871.08] don't get me wrong it's just there's
[867.56 - 872.28] certain little laws in the manifestation
[871.08 - 874.76] game that I'm was trying to tell you
[872.28 - 876.88] about a little bit okay so we have to
[874.76 - 878.00] dig out that that whole compassion we
[876.88 - 880.84] have to dig it out for chemical
[878.00 - 883.12] sensitivity people because they are real
[880.84 - 885.92] they are real they're very very
[883.12 - 888.24] difficult situations when sensitivities
[885.92 - 890.28] are moderate to extreme individuals will
[888.24 - 891.68] often confine themselves to home because
[890.28 - 893.28] it feels like it's the only safe place
[891.68 - 894.96] but there's a catch 22 so many people
[893.28 - 895.88] are in just situations where they
[894.96 - 897.32] feeling like their chemical
[895.88 - 899.32] sensitivities are actually in the home
[897.32 - 902.24] theirself or in their homes
[899.32 - 904.16] that's really diffic difficult so
[902.24 - 906.68] difficult and so they're in this Catch
[904.16 - 908.04] 22 right you guys you know when they
[906.68 - 909.48] think their apartment you know there's
[908.04 - 910.68] all kinds of things there's mold this
[909.48 - 913.28] that there's everything else and
[910.68 - 915.60] sensitivities and and you know whether
[913.28 - 917.68] carpet cleaning fragrance outgassing
[915.60 - 918.92] construction materials chemical presence
[917.68 - 920.28] in the home they're always worried
[918.92 - 922.04] people are like crap they're like
[920.28 - 923.52] strapped in there and they're trapped
[922.04 - 925.80] but yet they got knowwhere else to go
[923.52 - 929.16] because they don't have where else to go
[925.80 - 931.84] I'm serious this is really hard
[929.16 - 934.28] and since the outside world has its own
[931.84 - 936.16] threats often unpredictable ones like
[934.28 - 938.88] these people feel like they can't go
[936.16 - 941.20] anywhere you go into a department store
[938.88 - 944.12] and you're just completely covered in
[941.20 - 947.08] Cologne and and plugging fresheners and
[944.12 - 948.56] God knows what things that actually yeah
[947.08 - 950.56] things that make Chemical sensitivities
[948.56 - 954.32] worse and worse and worse and worse you
[950.56 - 956.00] better believe it yeah that's right you
[954.32 - 958.12] walk through a park you get sprayed you
[956.00 - 960.24] walk by somebody's yard you get sprayed
[958.12 - 961.36] yeah you better better believe it and
[960.24 - 962.92] depending on where you live they're
[961.36 - 967.00] spring
[962.92 - 970.72] 24/7 literally spring the most dangerous
[967.00 - 973.20] fungicides and herbicides 24/7
[970.72 - 975.96] everywhere people's Lawns neighborhoods
[973.20 - 977.80] oh you got 12 houses on a street I'm
[975.96 - 980.64] just saying I mean that's a tiny Street

[980.64 - 985.20] six of them are just spraying stuff

[1000.64 - 1004.12] then your neighbor who could be chemical
[1002.40 - 1007.56] sensitive yeah

[1007.56 - 1013.24] become chem chemical sensitivity meaning
[1010.48 - 1018.60] sensitive because of that kind of thing
[1013.24 - 1020.60] I mean seriously look you know it's look
[1018.60 - 1022.16] chemical sensitivities tend to vary from
[1020.60 - 1023.72] person to person too and there's a lot
[1022.16 - 1025.44] of reasons for that we're going to talk
[1023.72 - 1028.88] about why and what it's all about why
[1025.44 - 1032.48] it's even in the liver book the liver
[1028.88 - 1036.36] book this Beast of a book if you don't
[1032.48 - 1040.76] have it by now order it order it why did

[1054.64 - 1058.80] helping yourself cuz that's all that
[1056.04 - 1061.20] matters to me I'd give it out for free
[1058.80 - 1062.92] all I could and would if it didn't cost
[1061.20 - 1064.60] money for Printing and Publishing and
[1062.92 - 1066.68] putting it out there so it literally can
[1064.60 - 1068.96] get in somebody's hands from far away
[1066.68 - 1071.96] places but get to the library if you
[1068.96 - 1074.76] can't afford a book absolutely and I put

[1074.76 - 1079.60] medium and I don't charge it volumes of
[1077.44 - 1082.20] it Medical medium.com blogs everything
[1079.60 - 1084.16] else Instagram Facebook articles

[1084.16 - 1087.12] sure you get it so just please please
[1085.96 - 1089.24] take part
[1087.12 - 1092.72] partake and know you don't have to buy
[1089.24 - 1095.84] into some program some crazy program and
[1092.72 - 1098.52] SP spend money or buy you know a million
[1095.84 - 1100.44] dollars and something okay so here's the
[1098.52 - 1102.12] deal it's almost as if these
[1100.44 - 1105.72] sensitivities move and shift for a lot
[1102.12 - 1107.88] of people and the condition Alters out
[1105.72 - 1109.60] nowhere you know you may need to change
[1107.88 - 1111.04] yourself all of a sudden you may need to
[1109.60 - 1112.64] change your perfume you're sensitive
[1111.04 - 1114.12] perfume when you weren't next time it's
[1112.64 - 1115.76] hairspray like oh my God I wasn't
[1114.12 - 1118.32] sensitive to hairspray or aerosol some
[1115.76 - 1119.80] kind of aerosol but now I am so that can
[1118.32 - 1122.12] all
[1119.80 - 1123.84] happen maybe you're you're you then
[1122.12 - 1125.96] become sensitive to your allnatural
[1123.84 - 1129.12] shampoo that you always that always did
[1125.96 - 1132.92] you right this is how difficult it is
[1129.12 - 1135.56] the inconsistency can make somebody go
[1132.92 - 1138.28] crazy not because they're crazy to begin
[1135.56 - 1139.76] with no they got the chemical
[1138.28 - 1143.16] sensitivities but they end up going
[1139.76 - 1145.08] crazy you can it's really difficult and
[1143.16 - 1148.80] and and and we have to have compassion
[1145.08 - 1150.56] for this this topic you know you may be
[1148.80 - 1152.60] one of those people who finds your
[1150.56 - 1155.20] sensitivity
[1152.60 - 1158.12] manageable but if you don't take care of
[1155.20 - 1159.48] something it could become unmanageable
[1158.12 - 1160.80] there's something you got to learn to
[1159.48 - 1162.52] take care of there's something you got
[1160.80 - 1164.72] to learn how to do there's something you
[1162.52 - 1166.84] need to do you guys in order to make
[1164.72 - 1170.24] sure you don't run into that kind of
[1166.84 - 1170.24] problem where it becomes
[1170.96 - 1176.16] unmanageable
[1173.72 - 1177.88] yeah because there's a lot to do with a
[1176.16 - 1179.80] lot of things here we're going to cover
[1177.88 - 1182.32] that so we got to be careful and you got
[1179.80 - 1187.84] to make sure you got to make
[1182.32 - 1191.20] sure that look for example to avoid a
[1187.84 - 1193.08] plug-in air freshener when you can and
[1191.20 - 1195.84] you get by so you feel like you can
[1193.08 - 1197.44] manage it that's a mild sensitivity but
[1195.84 - 1199.44] then there a person who has to avoid
[1197.44 - 1201.72] multiple items conventional hairsprays
[1199.44 - 1204.20] colog fabric softers Cleaning Solutions
[1201.72 - 1207.32] and yes fresheners air fresheners of
[1204.20 - 1209.88] course which many people can't tolerate
[1207.32 - 1214.32] and rightfully so it's
[1209.88 - 1218.12] toxic toxic because you're extremely
[1214.32 - 1221.04] toxic because the enemy just a whiff is
[1218.12 - 1223.76] a debilitating situation here
[1221.04 - 1227.68] hypervigilance required makes it so much
[1223.76 - 1229.36] more difficult to operate and manage you
[1227.68 - 1231.36] know it's where are you going where are
[1229.36 - 1232.96] you going today where are you heading
[1231.36 - 1234.92] you heading to a store what's in the

[1241.28 - 1244.84] sitting behind the desk is she wearing
[1243.04 - 1246.36] some strong perfume and hairspray behind

[1261.96 - 1265.20] get the you're going to get the truth
[1263.56 - 1267.88] and you're going to get you're going to
[1265.20 - 1269.40] get the information it's unbelievable I
[1267.88 - 1272.40] did this liver book because I don't hear
[1269.40 - 1274.36] anything anything the best experts on
[1272.40 - 1276.96] the so-called Circuit of Health and
[1274.36 - 1279.92] Wellness pedaling whatever kind of like
[1276.96 - 1281.40] stuff they want to sell I mean you go
[1279.92 - 1283.16] through their books and it's it's

[1294.60 - 1298.36] a chapter all about that how we got to
[1296.48 - 1299.92] where we got to and how the best experts
[1298.36 - 1302.56] in leading people in health and wellness
[1299.92 - 1304.28] going around are literally just you know
[1302.56 - 1305.80] pedaling their own platform stuff to
[1304.28 - 1307.16] make money and then in the end what
[1305.80 - 1309.88] information do they really have about
[1307.16 - 1312.08] chronic illness it's not much it's very
[1309.88 - 1314.92] little so you need to make sure you get

[1367.76 - 1373.00] air fresheners bad chemically treated
[1370.16 - 1374.04] pulper can sneak up on you so how are
[1373.00 - 1375.16] you going to function when you don't
[1374.04 - 1376.56] know where you're going like you're at
[1375.16 - 1377.96] the dent office wherever you go and you
[1376.56 - 1378.92] got to worry about all these things
[1377.96 - 1381.28] things
[1378.92 - 1384.84] nonstop and there's an activator around
[1381.28 - 1389.40] every corner an instigator around every
[1384.84 - 1391.40] corner for god sakes every
[1389.40 - 1393.48] corner yeah
[1391.40 - 1395.76] exactly
[1393.48 - 1397.36] exactly and even Christmas trees are
[1395.76 - 1398.84] sprayed with some kind of concoction to
[1397.36 - 1400.48] keep them looking green as long as
[1398.84 - 1402.72] possible or as fresh as looking possible
[1400.48 - 1404.68] and even fake fake Christmas trees are
[1402.72 - 1407.04] treated with nanotechnology now and
[1404.68 - 1411.24] solutions that can set somebody off so
[1407.04 - 1413.20] Christmas becomes a bummer a bummer if
[1411.24 - 1415.00] you celebrate
[1413.20 - 1417.44] Christmas you
[1415.00 - 1420.24] know those who are chemical sensitive
[1417.44 - 1423.64] are forced to become experts they're
[1420.24 - 1426.88] forced to become an
[1423.64 - 1430.28] expert they're forced to become an
[1426.88 - 1432.08] expert and you know it it it's difficult
[1430.28 - 1434.12] and it doesn't mean there's still an
[1432.08 - 1435.36] expert they're an expert at maybe what
[1434.12 - 1436.88] could be triggers but they're not an
[1435.36 - 1439.12] expert at what the heck's causing it cuz
[1436.88 - 1442.24] science and research once again leave
[1439.12 - 1444.68] everybody hanging leave everybody
[1442.24 - 1446.40] hanging all that research money goes
[1444.68 - 1448.20] into just whatever investors are putting
[1446.40 - 1449.44] it into at all the time thumb on the
[1448.20 - 1451.80] scale leaving everybody hanging in
[1449.44 - 1454.04] chronic illness like you can never
[1451.80 - 1455.92] believe
[1454.04 - 1459.36] unbelievable and you know you can have
[1455.92 - 1462.24] all the best technology you want and
[1459.36 - 1465.20] still someone has chronic UTI with no
[1462.24 - 1469.36] with taking antibiotics once a month
[1465.20 - 1471.88] with no like no sight no sight in front
[1469.36 - 1474.28] of them of it being like the light
[1471.88 - 1476.44] coming yeah that's just one little thing
[1474.28 - 1480.64] I talk about that in Liver Rescue a show
[1476.44 - 1482.08] thousands of things the um so they
[1480.64 - 1484.28] become experts they're forced to become
[1482.08 - 1485.80] experts and be mindful that's what
[1484.28 - 1488.60] people are do with chemical sensitives
[1485.80 - 1490.36] are forced to do that's that's how it
[1488.60 - 1492.32] works they see things in a different way
[1490.36 - 1494.48] they have their eyes and a Different
[1492.32 - 1496.76] Light they have to see things in a
[1494.48 - 1499.76] different way chemical
[1496.76 - 1502.60] sensitivities that you know chemical
[1499.76 - 1506.28] sensitivities make it so you have to
[1502.60 - 1509.40] leave your rosec colored glasses
[1506.28 - 1511.72] behind it's such a bummer you know
[1509.40 - 1513.08] because yeah those Road those Rose
[1511.72 - 1516.16] Colored
[1513.08 - 1518.44] Glasses do tend to get people through
[1516.16 - 1521.08] life in many
[1518.44 - 1523.08] ways they also get you in trouble too so
[1521.08 - 1526.60] maybe those rose colored glasses are not
[1523.08 - 1528.88] a good thing they must dedicate an
[1526.60 - 1530.56] immense amount of energy that's that's
[1528.88 - 1533.04] what these people have to do that's what
[1530.56 - 1534.96] you guys have to do in reading labels
[1533.04 - 1537.00] have you ever done that done the label
[1534.96 - 1540.88] thing but you really have to read the
[1537.00 - 1542.24] labels right not just a little bit and
[1540.88 - 1544.48] you got to figure out what's in really
[1542.24 - 1546.36] what's in every product how they come
[1544.48 - 1549.12] across everything ingredients you name
[1546.36 - 1551.72] it pets and pet stuff too all of
[1549.12 - 1553.36] it it's
[1551.72 - 1555.20] unbelievable and you're all about
[1553.36 - 1557.72] hyperallergenic that's what we got to
[1555.20 - 1558.60] all be about so that's another thing too
[1557.72 - 1561.24] it's
[1558.60 - 1562.84] endless and and even clothes you know
[1561.24 - 1565.04] saturated with multiple synthetic
[1562.84 - 1567.00] laundry chemicals you know and air
[1565.04 - 1570.08] fresheners that go on clothes and
[1567.00 - 1571.76] leeching out oils doesn't have an effect
[1570.08 - 1573.88] unknown effect meaning it's unknown
[1571.76 - 1575.44] effects on humans it has real effects
[1573.88 - 1577.40] see here's the thing if everybody thinks
[1575.44 - 1581.04] they're escaping all of this they're
[1577.40 - 1582.52] wrong they're wrong just cu the canaries
[1581.04 - 1585.76] just because the
[1582.52 - 1587.36] canaries are being affected first
[1585.76 - 1590.36] doesn't mean you're not being affected
[1587.36 - 1591.80] now now and later never forget unless
[1590.36 - 1593.28] you do something and take care of what
[1591.80 - 1594.80] your liver that's what we're going to go
[1593.28 - 1597.48] into pretty
[1594.80 - 1599.00] soon those who are newly chemical
[1597.48 - 1600.56] sensitive and you guys will probably
[1599.00 - 1602.24] ring true on this you'll tell me you'll
[1600.56 - 1605.04] be like yeah he
[1602.24 - 1606.88] knows those who are newly chemical
[1605.04 - 1609.32] sensitive have a very tough time of it
[1606.88 - 1611.80] oh man is it rough new chemical
[1609.32 - 1615.32] sensitivity for a new person a new be on
[1611.80 - 1617.32] the Block whoa it's rough it's rough and
[1615.32 - 1619.76] maybe I'm look I just think it is but
[1617.32 - 1621.92] maybe I'm wrong you tell me am I wrong
[1619.76 - 1623.76] about that one when you were brand new
[1621.92 - 1627.32] at it with chemical sensitivity was was
[1623.76 - 1629.56] it was it's was it extra difficult that
[1627.32 - 1631.80] me my wrong I don't
[1629.56 - 1634.08] know I'm not right about everything
[1631.80 - 1636.32] spirit is but I'm not you know you know
[1634.08 - 1638.88] the story in the book Origins medical
[1636.32 - 1640.12] medium I stepped on a rake smacked me
[1638.88 - 1641.96] right in the
[1640.12 - 1643.48] [Laughter]
[1641.96 - 1645.92] face
[1643.48 - 1647.92] um even though the person I was talking
[1645.92 - 1649.64] to could walk again because it's Spirits
[1647.92 - 1652.44] information I do stupid things though
[1649.64 - 1654.20] personally separate I'll say something
[1652.44 - 1655.80] stupid step on a rake smack it in my
[1654.20 - 1659.76] head cuz I'm not looking at where I'm
[1655.80 - 1663.20] going so those who are newly chemically
[1659.76 - 1664.76] sensitive have a very tough time of it
[1663.20 - 1667.40] first there's a process of becoming
[1664.76 - 1670.04] aware that's brutal that something's
[1667.40 - 1672.24] even wrong that's really hard it can
[1670.04 - 1674.44] create a tremendous amount of confusion
[1672.24 - 1675.96] stress headaches for the first time
[1674.44 - 1678.20] funny taste in your mouth runny nose
[1675.96 - 1680.36] it's always happening tingling tongue
[1678.20 - 1682.40] certain settings you tingling tongue in
[1680.36 - 1684.24] certain settings of your life getting
[1682.40 - 1686.00] tired easily while walking through a
[1684.24 - 1687.88] department store and breathing in
[1686.00 - 1690.08] thousands of synthetic chemicals or
[1687.88 - 1692.04] starting to feel a tight chest in the
[1690.08 - 1695.72] workplace that's really annoying from
[1692.04 - 1697.48] fragrances or other air day-to-day stuff
[1695.72 - 1699.96] yeah these aren't fun symptoms you think
[1697.48 - 1701.80] they're fun
[1699.96 - 1705.08] no
[1701.80 - 1707.00] newbi have a difficult challenge they
[1705.08 - 1710.00] have to find a doctor who doesn't say
[1707.00 - 1711.40] it's all in your head or maybe some some
[1710.00 - 1713.88] kind of motivational person to say
[1711.40 - 1715.36] you're not manifesting right that's why
[1713.88 - 1718.52] I mentioned it
[1715.36 - 1721.88] earlier yeah or you'll be shoved into
[1718.52 - 1723.52] the Lyme disease trap oh my God if you
[1721.88 - 1725.48] know listen if you want to know the
[1723.52 - 1728.48] truth about lime get medical medium book
[1725.48 - 1733.52] one read the lime chapter and try not to
[1728.48 - 1735.56] bring a torch or shovel or pitchfork to
[1733.52 - 1737.04] to to you know to my apartment building
[1735.56 - 1739.52] because when because when you learn the
[1737.04 - 1742.04] truth of Lyme disease it can anger
[1739.52 - 1743.40] people that's what I've learned even
[1742.04 - 1745.00] though there's all these there's there's
[1743.40 - 1747.16] actually at this point now hundreds of
[1745.00 - 1748.24] thousands healing from Lyme disease when
[1747.16 - 1750.52] they learn the truth from the
[1748.24 - 1752.52] information from medical medium but
[1750.52 - 1753.72] still it just still angers people
[1752.52 - 1756.08] because when you're conditioned a
[1753.72 - 1758.36] certain way and and to think a certain
[1756.08 - 1759.72] way and the labs they train you and
[1758.36 - 1761.88] condition the doctors and train the
[1759.72 - 1763.92] people it gets frustrating it gets
[1761.88 - 1765.96] frustrating but there's just you know
[1763.92 - 1767.72] it's unbelievable how things work but
[1765.96 - 1769.92] you might get thrown into that whole
[1767.72 - 1771.80] thing you know that that whole lime trap
[1769.92 - 1774.72] can easily get thrown in there so you
[1771.80 - 1777.20] got to remember that can easily happen
[1774.72 - 1779.88] and it does it does it gets a lot of
[1777.20 - 1781.68] people and it's really difficult and you
[1779.88 - 1785.20] want to be careful you don't end up like
[1781.68 - 1787.00] that because it happens now you know
[1785.20 - 1789.20] anyone with chemical
[1787.00 - 1790.92] sensitivities anyone with any kind of
[1789.20 - 1791.84] chemical sensitivities has a challenge
[1790.92 - 1795.48] on their
[1791.84 - 1797.40] plate really a big Challenge and you
[1795.48 - 1799.72] need to you know in finding support from
[1797.40 - 1802.56] a family member or friends is difficult
[1799.72 - 1805.40] too they may be bewildered or become
[1802.56 - 1807.20] sick of it all easily and come they
[1805.40 - 1810.36] could get sick of it quite fast there's
[1807.20 - 1812.40] no question since everything was fine
[1810.36 - 1815.64] before you know your body reactions
[1812.40 - 1818.20] aren't easy they're not easy for anyone
[1815.64 - 1819.12] to deal with it happens it happens all
[1818.20 - 1821.64] the
[1819.12 - 1823.00] time it's not and you know and people
[1821.64 - 1824.40] you know they got the perfumes and the
[1823.00 - 1825.84] makeups and they got the clones and the
[1824.40 - 1827.96] aftershave and you know they're at the
[1825.84 - 1830.00] Sal the salon or breathing in car
[1827.96 - 1831.36] exhaust and shopping at the mall and
[1830.00 - 1832.64] they got no complaints there's a lot of
[1831.36 - 1833.80] people that go through that they can do
[1832.64 - 1835.68] anything they can breathe and all those
[1833.80 - 1838.72] things throw after after shave is just
[1835.68 - 1840.72] horrendous cologne is by far one of the
[1838.72 - 1842.96] I can't stand I can't stomach cologne it
[1840.72 - 1845.36] makes me sick and that has nothing to do
[1842.96 - 1846.88] with a chemical sensitivity the smell of
[1845.36 - 1849.84] it just makes me like it gets me
[1846.88 - 1852.80] nauseous gets me nauseous cologne's a
[1849.84 - 1854.24] bad one it's like anytime I run across
[1852.80 - 1855.76] somebody and they got clone on their
[1854.24 - 1857.92] hands and they got clone all over their
[1855.76 - 1859.68] clothes and they shake my my hand or
[1857.92 - 1861.40] they give me a hug and it's covered on
[1859.68 - 1864.28] me I have to go and I have to change my
[1861.40 - 1866.48] clothes because the cologne is brutal it
[1864.28 - 1868.96] just it sits there and it gets caught in
[1866.48 - 1871.20] your sinuses and it stays in your
[1868.96 - 1873.52] sinuses and you get tasted and it ruins
[1871.20 - 1875.60] your meal I've had that happen where
[1873.52 - 1877.60] I've actually I've actually been in
[1875.60 - 1879.96] meetings with people loaded with cologne
[1877.60 - 1882.04] where I was inhaling it for hours and
[1879.96 - 1883.60] then literally tasting it my sinuses in
[1882.04 - 1885.36] my mouth and then we went to go get
[1883.60 - 1887.56] something to eat and my food taste it
[1885.36 - 1890.44] like cologne I'm like oh my God how do
[1887.56 - 1891.72] people live like this how do they live
[1890.44 - 1893.48] like this imagine somebody who's
[1891.72 - 1896.48] actually chemical
[1893.48 - 1900.04] sensitive imagine that situation how
[1896.48 - 1902.04] difficult it is you know I just hate it
[1900.04 - 1904.24] but they're actually chemical sensitive
[1902.04 - 1906.40] just imagine and I'm aggravated enough
[1904.24 - 1908.32] when I run across that where I'm like so
[1906.40 - 1909.88] put off I'm like oh my God I just can't
[1908.32 - 1912.12] stand this imagine somebody who's
[1909.88 - 1915.88] actually getting affected by it in all
[1912.12 - 1918.56] these other ways oh my God it's
[1915.88 - 1921.08] unbelievable so so you know look someone
[1918.56 - 1924.32] can develop a fresh sensitivity and when
[1921.08 - 1926.80] they do the reality is
[1924.32 - 1928.20] limiting limiting versus what other
[1926.80 - 1929.52] people can do and live in their life
[1928.20 - 1931.76] they say why can't I be in the real
[1929.52 - 1933.48] world why can't I live my life like I
[1931.76 - 1934.92] used to why can't I live like everybody
[1933.48 - 1937.16] else that just does what they want
[1934.92 - 1938.56] living in moderation eat in moderation
[1937.16 - 1940.20] just so you know that's all bold that'll
[1938.56 - 1942.24] just get you that moderation talk will
[1940.20 - 1943.64] just get you that'll just get you
[1942.24 - 1945.16] moderation doesn't work when you're
[1943.64 - 1946.40] actually dealing with chronic stuff
[1945.16 - 1948.36] internally and I'm not just talking
[1946.40 - 1950.44] about chemical
[1948.36 - 1951.96] sensitivities you know I've been you
[1950.44 - 1954.84] know the thing is is I've been a little
[1951.96 - 1956.96] bit more I guess sarcastic or annoying
[1954.84 - 1960.36] and and and I want to apologize for it
[1956.96 - 1962.48] just look listen just I might have just
[1960.36 - 1965.08] gotten a little bit more difficult maybe
[1962.48 - 1966.80] you know it's like each decade goes by
[1965.08 - 1968.52] and you think that you know I live by
[1966.80 - 1972.20] the Hope and Faith thing you know that's
[1968.52 - 1973.96] how I live is hope faith and um and I
[1972.20 - 1975.76] live by that and I always keep you know
[1973.96 - 1977.20] faith that you know research and science
[1975.76 - 1978.48] is actually going to you know do
[1977.20 - 1979.96] something that's just not about the
[1978.48 - 1981.96] money they're going to actually really
[1979.96 - 1983.32] like help people and I keep on thinking
[1981.96 - 1985.40] it's going to happen any minute because
[1983.32 - 1986.96] people who work for all these different
[1985.40 - 1988.96] situations venues or whatever and
[1986.96 - 1990.32] institutions they're all good people but
[1988.96 - 1991.92] they're trapped in whatever kind of
[1990.32 - 1994.44] bureaucracy that's involved with every
[1991.92 - 1996.32] bit of it so I get it so but I always
[1994.44 - 1997.92] have this faith that it's going to break
[1996.32 - 1999.08] through that all the truths that I bring
[1997.92 - 2000.08] in the medical medium series and
[1999.08 - 2001.24] everything else to help people with
[2000.08 - 2002.64] chronic illness is going to break
[2001.24 - 2004.04] through more and more and it has it's
[2002.64 - 2006.68] helped Millions around the globe
[2004.04 - 2009.36] actually at this point but but still
[2006.68 - 2011.28] it's not enough and what happens is I
[2009.36 - 2013.20] have this this hope and this faith that
[2011.28 - 2014.56] the new trendy doctors or the new trendy
[2013.20 - 2017.04] people that want to hang their hat on
[2014.56 - 2018.04] stuff on stuff that have a whatever and
[2017.04 - 2019.40] they put their books out on their
[2018.04 - 2020.72] internet information I always think
[2019.40 - 2022.48] they're going to just come around a
[2020.72 - 2026.28] little bit and they just don't and then
[2022.48 - 2028.40] I realize I'm alone I realize I'm alone
[2026.28 - 2030.56] and but but then I realize I'm not alone
[2028.40 - 2032.20] I got you guys you guys are experts you
[2030.56 - 2034.12] guys know you guys are practitioners you
[2032.20 - 2036.96] guys are doctors and I and I and I know
[2034.12 - 2038.32] that I know that but then I I I I also
[2036.96 - 2040.24] but I like I said I get can get
[2038.32 - 2042.56] irritable and I'm really sorry just take
[2040.24 - 2044.40] you just listen just you know please
[2042.56 - 2047.00] accept my apologies if you can when I
[2044.40 - 2048.48] get sarcastic I get a little bit of
[2047.00 - 2051.44] whatever Brash I get a little bit of
[2048.48 - 2053.44] abrasive whatever it is it's not towards
[2051.44 - 2055.88] anybody it's just it's towards the
[2053.44 - 2057.76] industries is what it is it's towards
[2055.88 - 2059.00] the industries and maybe a little bit of
[2057.76 - 2061.68] the people involved in some of the
[2059.00 - 2063.44] industries you like a can't it all right
[2061.68 - 2065.24] so here's the deal so I'm on the Hope
[2063.44 - 2067.52] and Faith game you know the Hope and
[2065.24 - 2070.68] Faith thing is I got faith
[2067.52 - 2073.92] I got faith that you know some someone
[2070.68 - 2077.80] else is going to actually you know
[2073.92 - 2079.52] start start a good fire yeah in the
[2077.80 - 2081.20] industries in the industries you guys
[2079.52 - 2083.32] are already starting the fires the good
[2081.20 - 2085.32] ones you guys are already you know
[2083.32 - 2086.96] starting to fires and it's helping out
[2085.32 - 2088.32] die out bad fires starting good fires
[2086.96 - 2090.80] and you're helping out to die out bad
[2088.32 - 2092.76] fires bad fires that become bad Trends
[2090.80 - 2094.76] and bad situations that bring people
[2092.76 - 2096.84] down so you guys are really doing I'm
[2094.76 - 2099.96] just blown away I'm actually just blown
[2096.84 - 2101.92] blown away all right so and then you
[2099.96 - 2104.28] have people who they have to become the
[2101.92 - 2106.08] experts they're already an expert they
[2104.28 - 2107.56] discovered their sensitivities years ago
[2106.08 - 2109.24] then you got those people right you guys
[2107.56 - 2111.84] know who they are you're probably one of
[2109.24 - 2113.28] them and they know what they can handle
[2111.84 - 2114.44] and what they can't afford they know
[2113.28 - 2115.76] what they can afford when they're
[2114.44 - 2117.92] exposed and they know what they can't
[2115.76 - 2119.76] afford that's right they also know what
[2117.92 - 2122.24] kind of boundaries to push up and put up
[2119.76 - 2124.88] there it it even could be predictable
[2122.24 - 2126.36] for them and and they can go through
[2124.88 - 2128.36] times of feeling better and handling
[2126.36 - 2130.68] more than waves of being able to
[2128.36 - 2133.08] tolerate less it's a game of chance we
[2130.68 - 2134.04] can't confuse chemical sensitivities
[2133.08 - 2137.16] with
[2134.04 - 2138.68] reactions to harmful chemicals though
[2137.16 - 2141.16] we're not talking here about highly
[2138.68 - 2144.12] regulated highly regulated and
[2141.16 - 2146.44] unregulated chemicals like those to
[2144.12 - 2148.64] visibly burn your skin we're not talking
[2146.44 - 2150.40] about those substances we we you know
[2148.64 - 2152.64] we're talking about substances that we
[2150.40 - 2155.48] can't see or feel ones that many people
[2152.64 - 2158.16] even can they they can't even smell how
[2155.48 - 2159.84] about that you can't even smell it
[2158.16 - 2161.48] how does someone develop develop a
[2159.84 - 2164.48] sensitivity that's invisible isn't it
[2161.48 - 2166.72] interesting how does it even happen what
[2164.48 - 2168.28] occurs right did you ever ask that
[2166.72 - 2169.28] question I'm asking that question I got
[2168.28 - 2172.44] the
[2169.28 - 2178.20] answer it all stems from guess what the
[2172.44 - 2181.88] liver the liver l i v e r the
[2178.20 - 2185.36] liver and that's one truth that not even
[2181.88 - 2188.12] chemical sensitivity people know about
[2185.36 - 2190.12] yet the best chemical sensitivity
[2188.12 - 2191.72] experts who are affected by it or
[2190.12 - 2193.40] so-called experts who say they know
[2191.72 - 2196.28] what's going on don't even know that
[2193.40 - 2199.16] that's what it's about they don't even
[2196.28 - 2201.76] know that's what it's about and if they
[2199.16 - 2203.32] did for some reason they got it from me
[2201.76 - 2204.64] and they got it from me long before this
[2203.32 - 2206.84] book came out cuz I've been talking
[2204.64 - 2210.32] about this for years and years and
[2206.84 - 2212.76] putting that information out there
[2210.32 - 2214.32] see all sufferers of chemical
[2212.76 - 2216.36] sensitivities have their guesses about
[2214.32 - 2219.12] why it happened to them you know they
[2216.36 - 2221.04] often have a landmark they play with you
[2219.12 - 2223.40] know got sprayed by a pesticide walking
[2221.04 - 2224.92] through a condominium Park some people
[2223.40 - 2226.96] think it started the day they ate a
[2224.92 - 2229.40] certain food some say it was the day
[2226.96 - 2231.36] they had their house painted yes these
[2229.40 - 2233.20] experiences can be triggers and the
[2231.36 - 2234.84] realization that something's wrong can't
[2233.20 - 2237.12] occur at these times they aren't the
[2234.84 - 2238.96] whole story though they're not the whole
[2237.12 - 2240.44] story what about the other person who
[2238.96 - 2242.04] got sprayed walking through the park or
[2240.44 - 2243.56] condo or whatever it is and they're not
[2242.04 - 2247.36] affected and they're just fine what
[2243.56 - 2250.08] about them how about that how about them
[2247.36 - 2251.92] apples you know he went to the hardware
[2250.08 - 2253.68] store or she went to the hardware store
[2251.92 - 2256.20] purchased her own pesticides on top of
[2253.68 - 2258.84] it sprayed them on their own
[2256.20 - 2260.48] lawn and didn't develop a chemical
[2258.84 - 2261.88] sensitivity maybe it could maybe it
[2260.48 - 2263.68] could happen down the road for him
[2261.88 - 2266.72] absolutely or her you better believe it
[2263.68 - 2269.08] can though not yet that wasn't their
[2266.72 - 2271.00] Landmark for the person who did develop
[2269.08 - 2272.88] a sensitivity it was about what was
[2271.00 - 2274.52] going on internally it was about what
[2272.88 - 2276.96] was happening internally the timing of
[2274.52 - 2278.48] the day in the park was random the Sens
[2276.96 - 2280.64] was going to happen anyway it had
[2278.48 - 2282.56] already begun somebody who did get
[2280.64 - 2284.44] triggered by walking through the park
[2282.56 - 2285.68] and they got triggered by a chemical
[2284.44 - 2287.16] that was sprayed or whatever it is
[2285.68 - 2291.32] walking through you know through
[2287.16 - 2293.12] condominium Park they got sprayed yeah
[2291.32 - 2296.64] and that seemed like the Treck that was
[2293.12 - 2299.28] that was just a random occurrence it was
[2296.64 - 2301.96] already going to happen it was already
[2299.28 - 2303.96] on its way let's go into chemical
[2301.96 - 2306.60] sensitivities let's go into chemical
[2303.96 - 2308.40] sensitivities baby let's go into that
[2306.60 - 2309.68] let's talk about that a little bit it
[2308.40 - 2312.08] all starts with the liver as I was
[2309.68 - 2315.24] saying it's your big sponge whose job is
[2312.08 - 2317.16] to collect catalog and check in
[2315.24 - 2320.20] thousands of what I call troublemakers
[2317.16 - 2322.72] in The Liver Rescue book that's right
[2320.20 - 2324.72] chemicals you name it liver's job is to
[2322.72 - 2327.20] try to protect you and shield you you
[2324.72 - 2329.36] know it it it that's its job it even
[2327.20 - 2331.64] Shields you against toxic substances
[2329.36 - 2333.68] your body creates it's natural for the
[2331.64 - 2335.48] body to create that for example when you
[2333.68 - 2337.28] experience fear the adrenals pump out an
[2335.48 - 2339.44] adrenaline that helps you survive at the
[2337.28 - 2341.80] moment but it's highly abrasive and
[2339.44 - 2344.20] toxic and dangerous to your brain and
[2341.80 - 2345.56] central nervous system it's so potent
[2344.20 - 2347.40] though that the liver must clean it up
[2345.56 - 2349.28] and absorb it all up and it's doing its
[2347.40 - 2353.96] job to protect you the rest of your body
[2349.28 - 2356.60] so it doesn't get in danger so the the
[2353.96 - 2358.20] rest of your body doesn't get in danger
[2356.60 - 2359.84] and then we also eat foods with bad
[2358.20 - 2361.52] ingredients that's hard on the liver and
[2359.84 - 2363.16] we eat high fat diets which is hard on
[2361.52 - 2364.40] the liver we all eat high fat diets I
[2363.16 - 2365.60] don't care how clean your diet is I
[2364.40 - 2367.88] don't care if it's the best vegan diet
[2365.60 - 2370.04] it is it's high fat unless you're really
[2367.88 - 2371.48] really really really doing a lowfat diet
[2370.04 - 2373.56] and you're probably not even doing that
[2371.48 - 2374.88] right you're not even doing that right
[2373.56 - 2376.08] unless you get enough celery juice and
[2374.88 - 2379.00] how many years have you been doing
[2376.08 - 2381.48] celery juice not long I bet if you have
[2379.00 - 2383.28] even done it celery juice by itself not
[2381.48 - 2385.88] even the best plant-based raw diet
[2383.28 - 2387.04] that's low fat is even getting done
[2385.88 - 2389.32] right doesn't mean you're getting enough
[2387.04 - 2391.20] leafy greens not even the best paleo you
[2389.32 - 2392.84] know low animal protein diet that's got
[2391.20 - 2394.92] a new fancy name to it that I won't
[2392.84 - 2396.08] answer I mean that I won't mention cuz
[2394.92 - 2399.80] the names are just getting stupider by
[2396.08 - 2401.36] the minute out there not even that diet
[2399.80 - 2403.48] has probably enough leafy greens in it
[2401.36 - 2404.96] and enough say celery juice and other
[2403.48 - 2407.04] things too and mineral salts and allone
[2404.96 - 2408.96] that so we you know we get we get
[2407.04 - 2412.84] exposed to all kinds of stuff grease we
[2408.96 - 2415.24] eat and grease on our skin exactly we go
[2412.84 - 2417.00] to we go on cruise sh ships and all the
[2415.24 - 2419.60] food on a cruise ship is sprayed with
[2417.00 - 2422.08] the preservative how do you like that by
[2419.60 - 2423.84] law and our livers must tend with it and
[2422.08 - 2425.28] deal with it so as we're dancing on the
[2423.84 - 2427.16] cruise ship and having a great time and
[2425.28 - 2429.08] breathing in everybody's and perfumed by
[2427.16 - 2430.40] the truckloads and all the insecticides
[2429.08 - 2431.44] and all the carpet cleaning chemicals
[2430.40 - 2433.48] that are all in the carpets and we're
[2431.44 - 2435.32] having a blast we're inhaling all that
[2433.48 - 2437.72] the liver's got to take it all in suck
[2435.32 - 2439.04] it all up and take it all in and then on
[2437.72 - 2440.56] top of that we're eating all the food on
[2439.04 - 2442.80] a crud ship I'm not ripping apart crude
[2440.56 - 2443.84] ships everything has its toxins and then
[2442.80 - 2445.84] all of a sudden you're eating all the
[2443.84 - 2447.88] cruise ship food forget it it's all
[2445.84 - 2449.68] laced it's all got chemical
[2447.88 - 2451.76] preservatives on it from chemical
[2449.68 - 2453.64] companies and then what about drugs we
[2451.76 - 2455.08] take oh I got a bad migraine let's take
[2453.64 - 2457.44] a drug or whatever it is that's going on
[2455.08 - 2458.64] that we we have to survive with and all
[2457.44 - 2460.12] kinds of things that happen when we
[2458.64 - 2461.36] don't know the cause of all our problems
[2460.12 - 2464.04] we have to do things we end up at the
[2461.36 - 2466.24] doctor's office taking drugs we ingest
[2464.04 - 2469.24] everything like
[2466.24 - 2470.88] that all of it going all the way back to
[2469.24 - 2473.20] antibiotics in their childhood they all
[2470.88 - 2476.48] the liver has to suck it up has to suck
[2473.20 - 2479.80] it up that's what it has to do just like
[2476.48 - 2481.56] your coach in high school at track or
[2479.80 - 2483.40] your coach at high school at lacrosse
[2481.56 - 2485.76] are you coach at high school at soccer
[2483.40 - 2488.52] or you coach at High School in in in um
[2485.76 - 2490.84] football or baseball suck it up walk it
[2488.52 - 2492.28] off that's what the liver has to do suck
[2490.84 - 2495.24] it up and walk it off that's what it has
[2492.28 - 2496.88] to do pathogens that's a real pain in
[2495.24 - 2499.00] the book cuz guess what that plays a
[2496.88 - 2501.44] real big role in chemical sensitivities
[2499.00 - 2503.96] I hate to drop this truth but it does
[2501.44 - 2505.88] EBV is one of the big ones they find
[2503.96 - 2507.20] their way inside the liver they make a
[2505.88 - 2509.00] home in there and they create a mess all
[2507.20 - 2512.00] on their own releasing waste like
[2509.00 - 2514.24] dermatoxin and neurotoxins it's the
[2512.00 - 2516.36] byproduct see all these troublemakers
[2514.24 - 2518.48] and more your liver is constant
[2516.36 - 2520.20] constantly at a ratio game how do I let
[2518.48 - 2521.60] what I got to let out how do I release
[2520.20 - 2523.72] how much I got to let out how do I got
[2521.60 - 2525.80] to control how much I got to control to
[2523.72 - 2528.00] protect them how much viruses inside of
[2525.80 - 2530.56] me how much everything else is going on
[2528.00 - 2532.60] that the doctor has no clue about on any
[2530.56 - 2535.16] level
[2532.60 - 2537.88] yeah how many germs can I come across
[2535.16 - 2539.88] right now how many Road toxins can get
[2537.88 - 2541.48] back into my bloodstream the liver is
[2539.88 - 2543.92] watching all this how many medicines are
[2541.48 - 2546.24] being ingested how many all these kinds
[2543.92 - 2549.16] of things how much alcohol are in herbal
[2546.24 - 2550.68] supplements that I've been shunning for
[2549.16 - 2552.84] decades
[2550.68 - 2557.24] decades yeah I've been
[2552.84 - 2560.24] shunning that for decades for real yeah
[2557.24 - 2561.72] for real and you know and I'm telling
[2560.24 - 2564.24] you right now that's a bad one all on
[2561.72 - 2566.64] its own doesn't mean your practitioner
[2564.24 - 2568.68] is a bad guy or your doctor's a bad
[2566.64 - 2571.48] person or Bad Gal it's not it at all
[2568.68 - 2575.16] they just don't know that the alcohol is
[2571.48 - 2576.72] bad in supplements always remember that
[2575.16 - 2578.12] protect yourself
[2576.72 - 2579.48] um and then maybe you'll teach them
[2578.12 - 2580.76] something So eventually they won't use
[2579.48 - 2582.36] it that's all so they can do their
[2580.76 - 2583.16] beautiful work and help people like they
[2582.36 - 2585.76] want
[2583.16 - 2588.92] to how much can the liver afford to let
[2585.76 - 2590.48] go or eliminate from your body that's
[2588.92 - 2592.88] the whole point when you're going to
[2590.48 - 2594.84] bathroom or anything else that's that
[2592.88 - 2598.20] all that's critical to know every every
[2594.84 - 2599.64] last bit of this you know when the liver
[2598.20 - 2601.48] is sluggish and the colon is already
[2599.64 - 2603.56] dirty which is most people and yet more
[2601.48 - 2605.64] poisons keep coming in from toxic food
[2603.56 - 2607.52] sources fresh paint a visit to a store
[2605.64 - 2608.96] with sent candles air freshers plugged
[2607.52 - 2611.24] in at dentist office waiting room
[2608.96 - 2612.92] delivery truck spewing out exhaust and
[2611.24 - 2614.56] idles your driveway I'm trying to talk
[2612.92 - 2616.88] as fast as I can cuz I know I run out of
[2614.56 - 2618.32] time every show and I hate running out
[2616.88 - 2622.16] of time with you
[2618.32 - 2624.52] guys cuz I love you guys so all this
[2622.16 - 2626.28] stuff the liver has to deal with it work
[2624.52 - 2628.40] with it in a whole bit toxic weed killer
[2626.28 - 2630.36] that we run across everything we get hit
[2628.40 - 2632.00] with the liver gets hit with and over
[2630.36 - 2633.96] time the liver has grown sluggish for
[2632.00 - 2635.48] everybody everybody with chemical
[2633.96 - 2638.00] sensitivities even if it starts younger
[2635.48 - 2641.00] the liver is grown grown tired sluggish
[2638.00 - 2642.20] and problematic the final triggers are
[2641.00 - 2644.60] not the
[2642.20 - 2647.64] cause here this is what I'm trying to
[2644.60 - 2649.76] say the final trigger of what you think
[2647.64 - 2650.96] triggered you to chemical sensitivity
[2649.76 - 2654.16] whether it's mold in your house or
[2650.96 - 2657.72] something else is not the
[2654.16 - 2660.44] cause is not the
[2657.72 - 2662.00] cause you can have a viral situation in
[2660.44 - 2663.64] the liver since birth you could have a
[2662.00 - 2665.44] viral situation like Epstein bar in your
[2663.64 - 2667.72] liver for years and that's one of the
[2665.44 - 2669.68] true causes is like the Epstein bar
[2667.72 - 2672.04] virus sitting in there along with strep
[2669.68 - 2674.52] sitting in there
[2672.04 - 2676.56] absolutely percolating eating stuff the
[2674.52 - 2677.84] whole bit and then finally you get one
[2676.56 - 2679.48] last trigger and you think it's that
[2677.84 - 2682.56] trigger that did
[2679.48 - 2684.16] it a sensitive central nervous system is
[2682.56 - 2686.08] behind chemical
[2684.16 - 2687.84] sensitivities it's behind it it's
[2686.08 - 2689.04] another big part of it all and why
[2687.84 - 2690.52] because when you have Epstein bar
[2689.04 - 2692.44] releasing neurotoxins because it's
[2690.52 - 2694.60] eating tons of toxins lots of toxins
[2692.44 - 2696.12] inside your liver and spewing it out of
[2694.60 - 2698.12] your liver and it's floating around your
[2696.12 - 2699.76] body it affects the central nervous
[2698.12 - 2703.20] system and guess what chemical
[2699.76 - 2706.88] sensitivities are all central nervous
[2703.20 - 2709.48] system that's right toxins that the
[2706.88 - 2711.20] liver can't neutralize or contain get
[2709.48 - 2712.44] overloaded and the ner nervous system
[2711.20 - 2715.08] pays the
[2712.44 - 2716.76] price this can take in the form of all
[2715.08 - 2718.68] kinds of things funny feelings in the
[2716.76 - 2721.96] mouth sense that you can't breathe
[2718.68 - 2723.96] deeply or right blurry eyes yep chronic
[2721.96 - 2726.16] headaches migraines fatigue tingles and
[2723.96 - 2727.52] numbness insomnia dizziness anxiety
[2726.16 - 2730.68] depression and
[2727.52 - 2732.36] more yeah and more some of these
[2730.68 - 2734.80] symptoms can happen independently for
[2732.36 - 2736.88] example as a result of Epstein Bar's
[2734.80 - 2739.04] neurotoxins going after the nervous
[2736.88 - 2740.76] system chemical sensitivities also can
[2739.04 - 2742.28] cause it and that's all part of it being
[2740.76 - 2747.56] viral
[2742.28 - 2747.56] too yeah big thing to know that's how it
[2747.80 - 2752.92] works often neurotoxins and dermato
[2750.64 - 2754.80] toxins from Epstein bar combined with
[2752.92 - 2756.44] certain toxins stored inside the liver
[2754.80 - 2759.04] create chemical Cent sensitivities
[2756.44 - 2760.56] messing everybody up and causing trouble
[2759.04 - 2762.96] that's the big one I'm I'm telling you
[2760.56 - 2765.32] right now for a person who has
[2762.96 - 2767.00] EBV without the right kind of toxic
[2765.32 - 2768.64] heavy metals pesticides and Li and
[2767.00 - 2770.52] chemicals inside the liver may
[2768.64 - 2772.64] experience a different kind of chemical
[2770.52 - 2774.16] sensitivity or not even experience it at
[2772.64 - 2776.36] all
[2774.16 - 2778.04] yet there's a lot of different things to
[2776.36 - 2779.56] learn you guys should saturate yourself
[2778.04 - 2781.48] in the medical medium book series so you
[2779.56 - 2783.48] really become that expert get the
[2781.48 - 2786.76] thyroid healing book just get all the
[2783.48 - 2789.68] books I mean just get them get the
[2786.76 - 2792.28] books I you just need to you really do
[2789.68 - 2794.16] and this one right here is my God yeah
[2792.28 - 2797.36] the liver book you have to
[2794.16 - 2799.00] get you know I was proud of spirit with
[2797.36 - 2800.56] this book when Spirit gave me every bit
[2799.00 - 2803.00] of the information that was put into
[2800.56 - 2805.04] this book I was proud I handw wrote the
[2803.00 - 2806.80] whole book it was a stack of paper
[2805.04 - 2809.64] almost the height of the ceiling to
[2806.80 - 2811.24] begin with cuz I had to sit there day in
[2809.64 - 2813.88] and day out and take that information
[2811.24 - 2816.84] from Spirit until it was finally done
[2813.88 - 2818.88] that's been my job my whole life
[2816.84 - 2822.84] this you know what happens
[2818.88 - 2825.72] is unknown combinations Factor that's
[2822.84 - 2827.52] what happens too in medical research and
[2825.72 - 2829.32] science when they try to figure out the
[2827.52 - 2830.92] cause of chemical sensitivities doctors
[2829.32 - 2832.68] and other practitioners need to keep an
[2830.92 - 2834.24] open mind and learn that in most
[2832.68 - 2835.72] chemical sensitivity patients the
[2834.24 - 2838.16] central nervous system is the is
[2835.72 - 2840.80] weakened and a viral infection could be
[2838.16 - 2842.56] playing a very large role in all of that
[2840.80 - 2845.24] not every chemical sensitive person is
[2842.56 - 2847.52] dealing with an active viral infection
[2845.24 - 2849.44] but they must have had one at one point
[2847.52 - 2851.16] without a doubt at one point even if
[2849.44 - 2853.60] it's not active in the moment that's why
[2851.16 - 2855.12] doctors get confused too because it can
[2853.60 - 2856.80] still make you sensitive if you was
[2855.12 - 2858.00] active at one point if you had Mono a
[2856.80 - 2859.20] long time ago if you had a scratchy
[2858.00 - 2860.72] throat in college and it was actually
[2859.20 - 2862.28] mono but didn't know it was mono cuz it
[2860.72 - 2864.00] just went dormant and went away and went
[2862.28 - 2865.72] to the liver all these kinds of things
[2864.00 - 2867.20] and everybody has Epstein bar in their
[2865.72 - 2869.48] system
[2867.20 - 2872.12] so all of
[2869.48 - 2876.48] this all important to
[2872.12 - 2878.16] know so the bottom line is many people
[2876.48 - 2880.32] have a chemical sensitivity for a long
[2878.16 - 2883.72] time realize what's going on but when a
[2880.32 - 2885.48] chemical sensitivity makes itself known
[2883.72 - 2887.08] an emotional component kicks in that
[2885.48 - 2888.52] makes physical suffering harder than
[2887.08 - 2891.24] ever and that's a part I want to touch
[2888.52 - 2892.84] apart Right Touch with right now what
[2891.24 - 2895.68] could trigger
[2892.84 - 2898.40] it what could trigger it next is it
[2895.68 - 2900.36] getting better is it getting worse am I
[2898.40 - 2902.40] dying are all questions that happen with
[2900.36 - 2904.04] people with chemical sensitivities it's
[2902.40 - 2906.72] really difficult many people can't put a
[2904.04 - 2909.44] finger on what they're dealing with
[2906.72 - 2912.88] and they can't and it's a mystery fear
[2909.44 - 2915.28] heightens and OCD happens obsessive
[2912.88 - 2918.36] compulsive disorder can happen freedom
[2915.28 - 2920.16] from knowing what it is or the trigger
[2918.36 - 2922.24] or not is and everything else is what
[2920.16 - 2925.16] people need it doesn't happen overnight
[2922.24 - 2927.76] it's a slow build getting freedom from
[2925.16 - 2929.20] chemical sensitivities takes time that's
[2927.76 - 2930.80] why I put it in the liver book so you
[2929.20 - 2932.08] can work on this so you can get the book
[2930.80 - 2934.36] and work on it and figure out what you
[2932.08 - 2936.32] need to do healing from chemical
[2934.36 - 2938.88] sensitivities is possible I've helped
[2936.32 - 2942.68] thousands do it over the
[2938.88 - 2945.36] decades it is possible it is
[2942.68 - 2947.32] possible without a
[2945.36 - 2950.08] doubt I'm not
[2947.32 - 2951.92] blind I'm not blind to the fact that
[2950.08 - 2954.08] chemical sensitivity people have a
[2951.92 - 2956.04] difficult detox you know situation where
[2954.08 - 2959.24] they have difficult detoxing I'm not
[2956.04 - 2961.08] blind to that at all no way many can't
[2959.24 - 2962.68] even take a single supplement in order
[2961.08 - 2965.20] to try to sooth the nervous system or
[2962.68 - 2967.24] detox the liver because they're so darn
[2965.20 - 2969.32] sens of the poor things and you guys
[2967.24 - 2972.08] might be one of
[2969.32 - 2976.28] them if this is you don't think you're
[2972.08 - 2978.48] stuck food is the answer in this case it
[2976.28 - 2980.44] is and you can take care of your liver
[2978.48 - 2982.96] and nervous system carefully with food
[2980.44 - 2985.76] it's why I got The Liver Rescue book out
[2982.96 - 2987.08] this is just one reason why if you're
[2985.76 - 2988.32] not dealing with chemical sensitivity
[2987.08 - 2990.72] but you're interested in the show look
[2988.32 - 2992.40] into the book there's dozens and dozens
[2990.72 - 2994.24] of conditions that the liver is involved
[2992.40 - 2996.12] with that you probably have or deal with
[2994.24 - 2997.68] are dealing with and one one of them is
[2996.12 - 2999.08] not knowing that your liver is breaking
[2997.68 - 3000.28] down over the years so you become sick
[2999.08 - 3002.60] down the road so you may as well take
[3000.28 - 3004.00] care of your liver now and get the book
[3002.60 - 3007.00] it's
[3004.00 - 3007.00] important
[3007.04 - 3011.84] so trying to get it all out as much as I
[3010.20 - 3013.72] can but it's a fraction of what's in the
[3011.84 - 3015.36] book so we just do the best we can
[3013.72 - 3017.84] you're not the problem if your nervous
[3015.36 - 3020.32] system is really sensitive you may still
[3017.84 - 3021.32] react to certain exposures after you
[3020.32 - 3025.52] even
[3021.32 - 3027.04] heal it takes time you'll still have to
[3025.52 - 3030.12] follow certain boundaries work with the
[3027.04 - 3031.76] rules work with the foods be careful try
[3030.12 - 3032.80] not to get too much exposure while
[3031.76 - 3034.92] you're
[3032.80 - 3036.76] healing but here's the thing you have
[3034.92 - 3039.04] the right to react to the world that's
[3036.76 - 3041.56] toxic you're not the problem and never
[3039.04 - 3043.60] were toxic chemicals and constant
[3041.56 - 3046.20] stressors are the problem
[3043.60 - 3048.08] sensitivities are are not the problem
[3046.20 - 3049.84] it's just it's a valuable thing have
[3048.08 - 3053.40] being sensitive being sensitive is
[3049.84 - 3056.60] valuable not not not valuable it's
[3053.40 - 3058.60] valuable yeah even if your sensitivity
[3056.60 - 3060.28] goes away completely with your liver and
[3058.60 - 3063.80] nervous
[3060.28 - 3066.76] system okay even if it went away
[3063.80 - 3068.88] completely you're gifted a heightened
[3066.76 - 3071.00] awareness of The Perils of our world
[3068.88 - 3073.28] makes you
[3071.00 - 3075.20] gifted so that you can better protect
[3073.28 - 3078.56] your family yourself and your future
[3075.20 - 3081.40] remember that it means you're
[3078.56 - 3084.96] gifted knowing
[3081.40 - 3087.36] truth I can't even tell you it's that
[3084.96 - 3087.36] powerful
[3088.16 - 3092.16] the information from the medical medium
[3090.36 - 3093.40] radio shows and the series and the book
[3092.16 - 3095.96] series and everything else and the
[3093.40 - 3098.56] articles is information that's not
[3095.96 - 3102.32] contaminated it's pure it's
[3098.56 - 3106.32] clean and it's not it's not persuaded by
[3102.32 - 3108.68] belief systems it's not persuaded by the
[3106.32 - 3110.20] thumb on the scale and investors
[3108.68 - 3111.88] lobbyists that are in the medical field
[3110.20 - 3113.24] and everything else it's not persuaded
[3111.88 - 3116.36] by all of
[3113.24 - 3118.12] that it's not it's clean information
[3116.36 - 3120.40] it's independent and it's an independent
[3118.12 - 3122.64] Source take advantage of it while I'm
[3120.40 - 3123.64] still here take advantage of it wherever
[3122.64 - 3126.88] you
[3123.64 - 3129.52] can and um I just know I really care
[3126.88 - 3131.44] about you guys it's not regurgitated
[3129.52 - 3133.64] information that's out there in books
[3131.44 - 3136.60] every single day it's not regurgitated
[3133.64 - 3138.52] recycled remanufactured information it's
[3136.60 - 3142.52] trying to sell something or whatever it
[3138.52 - 3144.92] is and there's no info
[3142.52 - 3146.20] infomercial okay in front of every
[3144.92 - 3148.32] podcast
[3146.20 - 3149.92] sure I want you to get the book to heal
[3148.32 - 3152.24] you better believe it and I stand strong
[3149.92 - 3154.04] by that and if you can't afford it go to
[3152.24 - 3155.68] the library I don't care if a million
[3154.04 - 3158.00] people go to the library and get the
[3155.68 - 3159.76] book doesn't matter to me just get it in
[3158.00 - 3162.44] your hands help your family help your
[3159.76 - 3164.84] friends and get yourself
[3162.44 - 3166.60] better persuaded belief systems don't

[3166.60 - 3171.12] independent Source that's given to you
[3168.60 - 3173.76] and it's for you for a darn good
[3171.12 - 3175.36] reason take advantage of it take
[3173.76 - 3177.24] advantage of me with everything you got
[3175.36 - 3180.20] got and
[3177.24 - 3182.00] um and just know I love you dearly you
[3180.20 - 3183.72] take one day at a time I know so many of
[3182.00 - 3185.36] you suffered and it's not just chemical
[3183.72 - 3187.48] sensitivities he suffered from all kinds
[3185.36 - 3189.16] of different chronic conditions and I
[3187.48 - 3190.76] know science and research and chronic
[3189.16 - 3191.56] conditions has left everybody pretty
[3190.76 - 3195.32] much
[3191.56 - 3199.32] basically in the dark and I get
[3195.32 - 3201.68] it take one day at a time and uh I'm
[3199.32 - 3204.52] with you I stand behind you I believe in
[3201.68 - 3206.32] you and never forget it and uh my
[3204.52 - 3210.64] apologies if I sound
[3206.32 - 3213.56] annoying and I sound obnoxious even at
[3210.64 - 3214.60] times you know one thing Spirit told me
[3213.56 - 3217.20] are you ever going to lose your
[3214.60 - 3219.04] snappiness when I was a kid if you going
[3217.20 - 3221.00] to lose your sarcasm and I said no it's
[3219.04 - 3222.80] who I am so I'm going to keep it but I'm
