hello from costa rica awesome so um

the morning cleanse is really like a

46
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,840
life

47
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,439
savior in so many ways because when we

48
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:35,360
head into the holidays

49
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:38,159
we end up eating a lot of things that

50
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,840
get in front of us and we can't help it

51
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,880
many of us are under stress during the

52
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,200
holidays

53
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,960
a lot of pressure during the holidays

54
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,720
are you guys under pressure at all

55
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,079
are you guys under any stress at all

56
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,960
especially what's happening and what's

57
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,040
going on

58
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,640
and so you know the holidays are never

59
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,640
that easy for a lot of people some

60
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,640
people it's it's fun and easy

61
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,040
a lot of people it's it's more than that

62
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,640
and what happens is we end up eating a

63
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,840
lot of different things we indulge in

64
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,399
different things

65
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,040
more so than usual and then we say you

66
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,080
know what

67
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,599
i'm just gonna come january 1st i'm just

68
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,920
going to start fresh

69
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,599
and we end up just you know eating

70
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,440
whatever that's in front of us

71
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:17,520
doing a whole bunch of different stuff

72
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,640
and so what's incredible

73
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:24,239
about the medical medium warning cleanse

74
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:27,040
is that it's there to protect you while

75
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,000
you're running into a lot of different

76
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:32,000
food

77
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,560
um food potholes food obstacles

78
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,080
you know food mania whatever comes your

79
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,400
way during the holidays

80
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,040
so it's it that's something to think

81
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,480
about there all on its own so

82
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,959
and and you know people are like

83
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,800
georgina says yep work stress so yeah so

84
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,360
even work stress during the holidays as

85
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,640
well

86
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,640
so that's a big deal too and so

87
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,080
there's a question there will uh celery

88
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:57,040
juice help with the liver

89
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,560

90
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,159
why i'm gonna be making some celery

91
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,040
juice i'm gonna be making

92
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:05,040

cleanse to heal right now

153
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,199
in the morning cleanse it starts out

154
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:07,039
with the lemon water

155
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:09,600
first thing in the morning so every day

156
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,320
okay you're eating things indulging in

157
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,360
things

158
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,520
that come your way every single day the

159
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,120
liver just gets bombarded more and more

160
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,880
the reason why

161
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:23,520
people put on weight unwanted pounds

162
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,360
during the holiday okay is because their

163
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,000
liver is maxed out

164
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,000
and it's being it's being basically

165
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,680
compounded with lots of fat

166
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,039
so what happens is if you're eating some

167
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,720
pizza over here

168
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:36,639
even if it seems like a healthier pizza

169
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,520
or vegan pizza there's all this fat in

170
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,360
the pizza

171
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,720
and it's that fat that gets inside the

172
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,400
liver and

173
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,919
even if you're eating you know so if

174
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,919
you're eating other things too if you're

175
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,440
eating you know a few more eggs somebody

176
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:49,120
made you a nice breakfast and it's a

177
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,600
bunch of eggs scrambled eggs

178
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,680
maybe you got butter on some toast maybe

179
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,199
just doing avocado on toast and look

180
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,919
that's a healthier fat

181
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,560
but we do a lot of fats and our meals

182
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:01,520
consist

183
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,759
of fat every single day and so our liver

184
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:07,039
is already bombarded by all this fat

185
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:09,600
and when we eat fats in the morning

186
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:10,639
like peanut butter almond butter coconut

187
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,240
oil

188
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,080
even i know somebody that eats chicken

189
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,840
every morning like by like

190
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,919
mid-morning they're eating chicken or

191
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,759
bacon in the morning right

192
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:22,240
or eggs in the morning or milk cheese

193
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:25,360
butter all of that fat

194
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,280
stops your liver from cleansing so it

195
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,919
stops your liver from dumping out the

196
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,160
trash

197
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:32,560
it stops your liver from removing the

198
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:35,759
toxins and poisons

199
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,759
that actually keep us down as we get

200
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,039
older and older and older the unwanted

201
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,600
pounds come on

202
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:43,759
the weight comes on really easy that

203
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,400
happens like because the liver gets

204
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,759
maxed out and one of the cool things

205
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,080
about the morning cleanse

206
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,680
is you can do it every day or you can do

207
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,720
it now with the challenge right that

208
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,199
we're doing

209
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:57,120
and you're protecting your liver you're

210
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,199
protecting your immune system

211
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,360
you're protecting your lymphatic system

212
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:03,680
because that's an offshoot of the liver

213
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,440
you're protecting everything in your

214
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,120
body in so many different ways you're

215
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,280
protecting your pancreas because your

216
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,840
pancreas gets burned down with fats too

217
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,440
that's why people get pancreatitis and

218
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,840
during the holidays a lot of people get

219
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,240
gallbladder problems they get

220
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,479
pancreatitis

221
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,280
they get upset stomachs they get acid

222
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,720
reflux

223
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,160
because they're eating just a little too

224
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,599
much of this they're having some cake

225
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,440
they're having some cookies

226
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:27,039
they're indulging in a little too much

227
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,120
you know fats in different ways and

228
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:30,479
different foods and so

229
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,639
it's incredible about cleanse the heel

230
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:35,680
there's 75 recipes in here

231
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:37,360
and they're fat free and that's a big

232
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,360
deal because you can incorporate them

233
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,479
when you want but the morning cleanse is

234
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,199
great because

235
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:44,560
i'm not saying you shouldn't have

236
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,160
something that you like and i'm not

237
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,599
saying you shouldn't have avocados or

238
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,840

guacamole i love guacamole

240
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,599
i'm not saying you can't have any of

241
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,240
that or you can't eat a lot of chocolate

242
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,319
okay

243
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,000
all that fat in the chocolate and all

244
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,759
that caffeine i'm not saying you can't

245
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,039
have it during the holidays or anything

246
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:04,160
if that's what you want to do

247
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:05,680
but what i am saying is let's do the

248
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:09,120
morning cleanse

249
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:12,080
let's let our body heal while we're

250
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,960

00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,160
household cleaners fungicides that are

376
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,720
on new clothes

377
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:29,040
scented candles when you're breathing in

378
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,279
all that scented candle toxin which is

379
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,760
really one of the worst by the way

380
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,320
just so you know scented candles is a

381
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,079
life

382
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,079
shortener that means if you were

383
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:39,600
supposed to live to a hundred

384
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:42,079
scented candles throughout your whole

385
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,760
life will make it so you live to be 90

386
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,639
and you'll lose 10 years that's what

387
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:48,079
scented candle

388
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:50,800
candles will do air fresheners are life

389
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:52,720
shorteners and so we're breathing in air

390
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,959
fresheners when we go to do you know

391
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,320
appointments or you go somewhere or you

392
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:58,240
go you know you're in a store

393
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,079
and you're breathing in air fresheners

394
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,079
so if you have air fresheners in your

395
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:04,000
house pull them out of the walls

396
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:06,399
if you have the plug-ins and toss them

397
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,399
out if you're doing scented candles

398
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,440
toss them out because chemical scented

399
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,800
candles

400
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:15,360
and air fresheners are quintessentially

401
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,519
their life shorteners is what they are

402
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,560
so if someone was supposed to be 80

403
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:22,959
and and and we and they die at 80

404
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,600
okay well they're good we're going to

405
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:26,959
lose them

406
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:30,320
at 70. we're going to lose them at 72

407
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:33,600
we're going to lose them at 68. and

408
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,720
that's how dangerously toxic air

409
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,399
fresheners

410
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:39,120
and scented candles are so that's just

411
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:43,360
one example of how many poisons

412
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:45,199
we we we actually

413
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,639
ingest we actually breathe in we

414
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,800
actually get in our system

415
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,560
so when you think about toxins what kind

416
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:54,160
of toxins are we talking about

417
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:56,240
talking about um uh

418
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,639
like cleaning supplies we're talking

419
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,279
about fabric softeners we're talking

420
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,959
about

421
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:02,639
dishwashing detergents we're talking

422
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,240
about all those different things that we

423
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,040
might be exposed to we're talking about

424
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,519
water

425
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,839
in restaurants we're talking about toxic

426
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:11,920
heavy metals in water in restaurants

427
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,920
that's another thing right there too

428
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:16,240
so did you ever eat in a restaurant did

429
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:19,600
you ever drink water in a restaurant

430
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:21,680
that water in restaurants is just

431
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,360
city water that's filled with all kinds

432
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:26,480
of stuff it's filled with pharmaceutical

433
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:28,320
residue pharmaceuticals it's filled with

434
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:31,760
toxic heavy metals

435
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:34,480
so we have a lot of poisons and toxins

436
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:36,560
and then pesticide exposure insecticide

437
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,079

so that's all in here so these

465
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:28,320
troublemakers i call them are

466
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:31,199
in your system so herbicides pesticides

467
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,839
insecticides fungicides they're on new

468
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:34,160
clothing

469
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:36,000
they're in the air and then the

470
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,480
chemtrails that float out down from the

471
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,160
sky

472
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,079
you guys heard the chemtrail episode

473
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:42,639
medical medium podcast at apple podcast

474
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:44,320
right i told you all about the

475
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:46,079
chemtrails and how they really work and

476
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,880
the truth about them well we breed them

477
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:52,000
in every day and during the holidays

478
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:53,920
they drop chemtrails on us more so

479
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,120
than ever before during the holidays

480
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,360
because they know people are going to be

481
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,480
out and about and outside more in a lot

482
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,000
of different ways

483
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,440
so when you look up at the sky you'll

484
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,639
see more chemtrails than you've ever

485
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,680
seen before

486
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:07,600
and all of these poisons and toxins get

487
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:10,160
into our system

488
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,000
we inhale them we ingest them we eat

489
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,920
them we breathe them in

490
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,240
it's plastics petrochemicals

491
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,880
pharmaceuticals toxic heavy metals

492
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,240
insects

493
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:23,680
insecticides and pesticides so anyway

494
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:26,399
that's in us so keep that in mind so

495
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:28,240
every single and then there's foods then

496
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:30,160
there's the foods we eat

497
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,440
so there's lots of different foods we

498
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:34,639
that have

499
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:38,079
toxins in them too and not good ones so

500
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:40,160
if you've ever eaten conventional dairy

501
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:41,600
if you ever eaten conventional meat if

502
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,680
you ever eaten conventional chicken you

503
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,399
got the antibiotics in your system

504
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:48,079
if you had a piece of chicken that

505
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:50,160
wasn't organic that wasn't

506
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:51,440
path you know that wasn't free range or

507
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,800
whatever it is if you've had a piece of

508
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,320
chicken from 10 years ago from a

509
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,480
restaurant the antibiotics in that

510
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,920
chicken still sit inside your liver

511
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,079
and i'm not saying not to eat chicken

512
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,360
i'm just saying those antibiotics are

513
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:03,040
still inside your liver

514
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,039
so that's how it works if you took an

515
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:07,039
antibiotic it's still inside your liver

516
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:07,760
if you took cold medicine from 10 years

517
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:10,240
ago

518
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,799
15 years ago it's still inside your

519
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,919
liver

520
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:16,640
but what happens is we cannot

521
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:17,280
get this out of our body out of our

522
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,839
brain

523
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,360
out of our liver and restaurant food is

524
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,720
a big thing right there that's how we

525
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:25,280
get a lot of this

526
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:27,120
we can't get these toxins out of us if

527
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,400
we have fats in the morning

528
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,760
so if you have your nut butter in the

529
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,440
morning which is like a healthy thing

530
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,679
you got your almond butter you're making

531
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,559
your smoothie you put some coconut oil

532
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:36,000
in your smoothie

533
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:38,799
you're never going to get the poisons

534
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,919
out so you can't get the toxins out of

535
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:41,679
your system

536
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:43,360
you see how it works so the medical

537
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,799
medium morning cleanse is not just great

538
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:47,200
for the holidays

539
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:49,120
it's important to do whenever you can so

540
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:52,640
you can get these toxins and poisons

541
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:54,080
out of your body old ones that are deep

542
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,919
seeded in there you know

543
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,520
antidepressants that people have taken

544
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,960
in their life they sit inside the liver

545
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,600
thyroid medications

546
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:04,000
sit inside the liver anti-inflammatories

547
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:06,320
sit inside the liver a cold medicine

548
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,960
sits inside the liver antibiotics all of

549
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:11,039
it sits down in there so great okay

550
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:13,840
it does but let's do something about it

551
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:17,360
so to begin with you just got on here

552
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:21,200
16 to 32 ounces of lemon water or

553
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:23,679
lime water right in the morning upon

554
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:26,080
waking is the best time to do it if you

555
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:29,120
want to add a little bit of honey

556
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:30,799
to this lemon water you can you can add

557
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,799
a little bit of honey to this lemon

558
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:33,919
water if you really want to so that's

559
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:38,160

saw that drinking cj right now

609
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:50,400
amazing when you're doing 16 to 32

610
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:53,039
ounces on an empty stomach

611
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,480
you're not only helping your liver push

612
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:57,840
those toxins out

613
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:59,679
but you're neutralizing the poison and

614
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:03,039
toxins

615
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:06,480
it's phytochemical compounds

616
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:11,039
sodium cluster salts in celery

617
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:14,400
juice okay that neutralize

618
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:15,520
the charge the toxic charge that toxins

619
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,640
have

620
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:20,240
old pharmaceuticals have a charge to

621
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:23,360
them

622
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,720
that interferes with your body's

623
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:29,039
frequencies

624
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:33,200
keep that in mind toxic heavy metals

625
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:36,000
interfere with your body's frequencies

626
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,840
right i know that everybody's like

627
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,799
totally into the spiritual thing these

628
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,640
days

629
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:42,400
you know everybody's doing spiritual

630
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,159
work they're doing you know they're

631
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,000
doing spiritual growth they're doing

632
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:47,679
spiritual techniques they're reading

633
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,760
stuff they're doing stuff

634
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:50,799
listening to podcasts all these things

635
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,919
right

636
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:54,640
but what happens is these poisons and

637
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:58,000
toxins

638
00:21:54,640 --> 00:22:01,520
interfere with our spiritual makeup

639
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:06,640
they interfere with our physical

640
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:06,640
body our energy they interfere with our

641
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:13,280
energetic frequencies because

642
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:14,720
what happens is these these toxins and

643
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:18,400
poisons

644
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:21,840
they run on a very negative charge

645
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:24,720
so they run on a very very toxic

646
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,200
charge they actually have a life a shelf

647
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,240
life

648
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:32,000
toxins and poisons have

649
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,640
a shelf life that becomes damaging to

650
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,039
cells

651
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:37,760
inside our body so it's important to

652
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:41,440
know when you're doing your celery juice

653
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:43,360
you're neutralizing those toxins

654
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:46,080
is what you're doing you're disarming

655
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:48,880
them because

656
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:51,280
those toxins are on the offense they're

657
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,400
out there to be destructive and damaging

658
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:55,520
to the body

659
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:58,159
pesticides inside your body

660
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,640
fungicides herbicides toxic heavy metals

661
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:02,640
petrochemicals

662
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,640
pharmaceuticals

663
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:07,520
solvents that come from carpet cleaning

664
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,919
have you ever had your carpets cleaned

665
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:12,080
ever have your carpets cleaned all those

666
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:15,679
solvents and poisons

667
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:18,799
from the carpet from the carpet cleaner

668
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:21,760
go in to the bloodstream and they have a

669
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:22,640
charge on them that's damaging to our

670
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:26,240
body

671
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:28,720
okay celery juice when it gets into

672
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,480
contact with all of these poisons and

673
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:34,400
toxins

674
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:38,080
disarms them breaks down their charge

675
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:39,520
diffuses them so that's what it's about

676
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,400
so when people think well i did my

677
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,919
celery juice

678
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,159
i guess it might have helped it might

679
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:47,039
not have helped whatever

680
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:48,000
well guess what it did help and it is

681
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:49,840
helping that's

682
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,760
that's a part of why it gets people

683
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:55,039
better that's why with people with

684
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:58,000
eczema and psoriasis

685
00:23:55,039 --> 00:24:00,970
and skin problems vitiligo they have the

686
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,840
charge of copper and aluminum

687
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:04,320
[Applause]

688
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:06,000
um

689
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:08,960
carmen says i can't stay out of the

690
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,960
bathroom and i have to work i stopped

691
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,240
celery i'm assuming it's celery juice

692
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,960
because i can't stop

693
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,240
going if you're someone that has more

694
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,400
bacteria

695
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,159
in the abdomen if you have more bacteria

696
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,600
in the abdomen

697
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:24,080
you're going to be it's going to be

698
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:26,480
shocking that bacteria that bacteria is

699
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:29,279
toxic so when that bacteria

700
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:31,039
explodes your body's going to want to

701
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:32,960
rid it so

702
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:35,520
if you're if you have that kind of thing

703
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:37,440
going on i would consider

704
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:39,039
a small amount of celery juice is what i

705
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:42,559
would do i would consider a real

706
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:42,559
small amount of celery juice

707
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:48,000
and a smaller amount you could take baby

708
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:49,520
steps you can just go a little bit at a

709
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,240
time you can just go

710
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:54,240
um two ounces you can go four ounces you

711
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,760
can go a little bit at a time

712
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,679
and that's what you can do so that's

713
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,279
something that that's something that's a

714
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:02,640
way of doing it

715
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:04,320
the other thing is what else is

716
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,559
happening with your gut

717
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:08,159
that's the only thing you don't have any

718
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:09,200
bloating you've never had any gut

719
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:12,320
problems

720
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:14,400
you've never had the runs before or they

721
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:16,240
happening when you do other things

722
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,000
keep that in mind too always kind of

723
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,200
remember that if it's if everything's

724
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,039
perfectly fine

725
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,960
your stomach's fine everything's great

726
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:24,799
you never had a problem with any of that

727
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,559
then you drink some celery juice and you

728
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:28,480
have the runs well that's shocking the

729
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:30,720
bacteria that's what that is

730
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,960
um but keep keep that in mind but if

731
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,080
you've had other stuff too if you've had

732
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,760
the runs before

733
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,440
if something else triggers it other

734
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,919
things are going on

735
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,919
the liver a lot of stuff going on inside

736
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:43,600
the liver so you do baby steps just to

737
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:44,880
live this bad bacteria so you do a

738
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,559
little bit at a time a little bit of

739
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,480
time you start with four ounces

740
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:50,000
you can start with that right there so

741
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,360
you guys we're doing the medical medium

742
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,360
morning cleanse

743
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,799
and over time you'll be able to do a

744
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,440
little bit more and it's a little bit

745
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:56,960
more

746
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,480
and a little bit more and a little bit

747
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,200
more and that's what you can do over

748
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,840
time

749
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,480
and then eventually you'll be at 8

750
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,600
ounces

751
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:07,279
12 ounces 16 ounces 20 ounces

752
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,960
and you won't have the runs anymore

753
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:11,600
because you got rid of that

754
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:13,520
much bacteria that much of the bad

755
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,559

with celery powder

759
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:23,360
whatever you do and it's either you get

760
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:26,159

761
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:28,080
fresh celery juice from a juice bar

762
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:29,760
watch out for

763
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:32,559
celery that's already been juiced in

764
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:35,360

919
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:10,480
future

922
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:15,840

00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:36,000
the last 30 years i've seen people get

935
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:38,559
the flu during the holidays

936
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,000
it's always somebody in the family

937
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:42,640
somewhere out there and somebody's

938
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,519
family that gets the flu they get kicked

939
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,679
on their butt

940
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:47,600
they got a fever they got a bad cough

941
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:50,320
they get it around christmas time

942
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:52,000
their immune system runs down and they

943
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:54,159
get stuck with the flu

944
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
and flu season starts up around that

945
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:58,159
time and of course now we've got the the

946
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,760
new problem that we have now on top of

947
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:01,600
it so everybody's immune systems they

948
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:03,600
get lower during the holidays

949
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:05,279
they're eating foods that lower their

950
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,840
immune system whether they know it or

951
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:08,080
not

952
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:09,600
they get more susceptible to you know

953
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,360
the virus that's going around now they

954
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,360
get more susceptible to

955
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,640
flu virus they get more susceptible to

956
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:17,519
their own viruses

957
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:19,039
their own epstein bars shingles viruses

958
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:21,360
that give you chronic fatigue and

959
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:22,960
trigeminal neuralgia neck pain back pain

960
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:26,159
migraines

961
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:28,080
fatigue tingles and numbness floaters in

962
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:29,600
the eyes ringing in the ears dizziness

963
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:32,320
vertigo so they get ex

964
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,600
you get susceptible to your own viruses

965
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,799
that people have

966
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:37,039
like the epstein barr causing

967
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:38,640
hashimoto's and hypothyroid

968
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:40,480
and all the different thyroid conditions

969
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:43,440
and hyperthyroid and

970
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:45,519
cysts and nodules and pcos and

971
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:47,039
endometriosis so people already have

972
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:48,240
enough to deal with and then you got

973
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:50,559
outside viruses

974
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,399
okay you got the covid and you got the

975
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:53,919
flu and you got other viruses that are

976
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:56,240
happening on the outside that

977
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:58,320
aren't happening just on the inside of

978
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,120
people so then you got that in the way

979
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,799
out there

980
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,640
and then the holidays come and we're

981
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:04,640
under stress we're under pressure

982
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,000
we're eating the foods we shouldn't eat

983
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:08,720
and then our immune system

984
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,520
drops drops drops our liver gets

985
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:11,919
stressed out

986
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:13,440
stressed out to the max and then we go

987
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:15,040
into the winter feeling more

988
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:17,119
sick and a lot of people it's really

989
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:18,399
hard so that's some something right

990
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:19,760
there just think about

991
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:21,359
and i'm glad we're getting a chance to

992
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,599
talk about this so if you guys just came

993
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,200

00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:29,760
i'm excited i'm glad we're here glad

998
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:31,359
we're doing this so if you just came on

999
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:34,800

1000
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:37,200
lemon water 16 to 32 ounces

1001
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,720
i just did the celery juice 16 and 32

1002
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:42,879
ounces right

1003
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:44,800
and now it's time

1004
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:46,320
to make a smoothie that's what we're

1005
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,000
gonna do now okay

1006
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,599
so we can do a couple of things we could

1007
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,639
start out by throwing the wild

1008
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:53,839
blueberries in there

1009
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:56,879
it's two cups of frozen wild blueberries

1010
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:59,359
right there okay so i'm going to pop

1011
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:59,359
that in there

1012
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,520
now nobody knew what wild blueberries

1013
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:08,560
were until mm info

1014
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:10,640
and i

1015
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,599
i mean nobody knew they're just like

1016
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:14,480
blueberries

1017
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:15,680
no not blueberries wild blueberries yeah

1018
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,320
blueberries right

1019
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:20,480
no wild blueberries the little wild

1020
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,040
blueberries and now i'm hearing it out

1021
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,880
there

1022
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:24,320
it's out there on podcasts it's out

1023
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,720
there on youtube people are talking

1024
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,280
about

1025
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:28,560
wild blueberries you know and medical

1026
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:31,040
medium books

1027
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:32,560
actually blew up the whole frozen wild

1028
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,920
blueberry thing the whole wild liberty

1029
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:36,160
thing around the world

1030
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,960
so because millions of books went around

1031
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:39,359
the world

1032
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,800
it's the number one health books there

1033
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:43,520
is globally

1034
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:45,520
hands down for six years running i think

1035
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:47,599
is the medical medium book series

1036
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:49,760
and that's come with a lot of good stuff

1037
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:51,920
but it comes with also a lot of

1038
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,960
a lot of uh people that you know they

1039
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,800
don't like seeing

1040
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,079
they don't like seeing you get too many

1041
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,440
people better out there in the world

1042
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:58,000
because millions are healing for medical

1043
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:01,040
media books

1044
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,640
and that disappoints i think uh

1045
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:04,480
big pharma and stuff because then that's

1046
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:06,240
less pharmaceuticals more people get

1047
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,920
better on celery juice then less

1048
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,359
pharmaceuticals get sold

1049
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,880
you know you guys know the drill out

1050
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:12,320
there how it works so i got the frozen

1051
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:15,359
wild blueberries this is the heavy metal

1052
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:17,760
detox movie and what this smoothie does

1053
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:19,839
blue and l i didn't know wild

1054
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,400
blueberries existed before mm info

1055
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:22,240
indeed

1056
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:24,320
loon you're awesome i'm glad you're here

1057
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:25,599
incredible and um

1058
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:27,119
good to see you good to see you i'm

1059
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:29,680
still thinking about the potato poem

1060
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:32,400
that you wrote

1061
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:34,000
the night sprite that goes in there the

1062
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,200
potato poem you wrote that you put in

1063
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,160
the comment section

1064
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,560
it was actually a really good poem um it

1065
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:41,760
was

1066
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:43,680
it was really good okay so i got the

1067
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:46,720
frozen wild blueberries right here

1068
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:48,800
and um i'm gonna put

1069
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:50,320
two bananas in here you guys really want

1070
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,119
to do one banana and you can do one

1071
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:54,160
banana

1072
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:56,160
all right it's okay bananas are an

1073
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,599
incredible food great for the digestive

1074
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:00,079
system great for the liver

1075
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:01,119
glucose for the brain potassium for the

1076
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:03,440
brain

1077
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:05,359
if you hear somebody go like oh too much

1078
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:08,079
potassium too much potassium

1079
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:08,880
if you hear that you got to know one

1080
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:12,400
thing

1081
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:15,400
potassium is one of those little

1082
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:16,880
powerful minerals those little powerful

1083
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:19,440
electrolytes

1084
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:21,359
critical for the brain to function so

1085
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,880
take potassium out of the equation and

1086
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:25,839
your brain goes

1087
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:26,960
short circuits that's how it works so so

1088
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:28,400
when you hear someone

1089
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,320
that's that's kind of misinformation

1090
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:32,560
that's always out there there's just

1091
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:33,839
so much bad misinformation it's like

1092
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:36,320
bananas are bad

1093
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:38,000
potassium too much potassium too much

1094
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:40,480
this okay sure

1095
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,040
whatever okay just stop people from

1096
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,720
healing

1097
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,800
just keep on stop people from healing

1098
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:46,560
it's unbelievable so yeah so there's two

1099
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:49,520
bananas in here right there um

1100
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:50,480
a cup of cilantro i'm just gonna put you

1101
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,400

1102
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:54,000
big hunk right here which is going to be

1103
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:56,000
like you know my cup

1104
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,920
version so you can do that so i'm

1105
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,680
putting that in here

1106
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:01,599
so you throw some cilantro in here

1107
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:03,040
that's what you do just breaking it up a

1108
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:06,079
little bit

1109
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:09,079
i'm really you know the thing is is that

1110
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:11,440
the heavy metal detox smoothie has is

1111
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:13,119
responsible for saving lives it's

1112
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,880
responsible for getting a lot of people

1113
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:17,920
out of wheelchairs

1114
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:19,280
that were heavy metal in their brain

1115
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,920
aluminum deposits

1116
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,480
mercury deposits in their brain keeping

1117
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,440
them

1118
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:26,480
down keeping them sick multiple

1119
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:31,359

1193
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,480

1194
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,839

1206
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:09,040
smoothie is that a good thing i think

1207
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:11,599
that's a good thing or how about this

1208
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:14,000
you got alzheimer's and you're destined

1209
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:17,119
to die as far as the doctors believe

1210
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:19,520
okay and then all of a sudden you're

1211
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:20,720
you're your spouse or your sister or

1212
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:22,720

00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,880
and the alzheimer's starts to actually

1216
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:28,640
reverse and reverse and reverse to the

1217
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:30,720
point where you know your name now

1218
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:32,839
does that matter well yeah that's what

1219
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:35,839
i'm talking about

1220
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:37,200
lunelle um

1221
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:39,680
you're saying all i can tell you is that

1222
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:40,560
the info is real the real deal i'm not

1223

1225
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:46,800
the mm info

00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:48,720
i also stopped being chronically cold

1227
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:50,240
see belief systems

1228
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:53,200
i gotta tell you something about belief

1229
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:55,680
systems okay belief systems

1230
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:57,920
in health i have nothing against them

1231
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:59,680
but when someone says well

1232
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:01,440
there's this and then there's this and

1233
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:02,000
there's this out there well people don't

1234
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,480
know like there's

1235
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,079
fodmap and then you know you're not

1236
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,920
allowed to eat cold food because someone

1237
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:10,079
tells you that you got dampness

1238
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:12,560
you know because that's that's you know

1239
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:14,800
a traditional chinese medicine

1240
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:17,359
concept whatever the concept is out

1241
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:20,319
there whether it's western eastern

1242
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:22,640
it's all man-made it's man-made medical

1243
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:24,960
medium information is not man-made

1244
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:26,640
um i'm just a messenger so i'm just

1245
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,920
letting you know so you know what this

1246
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:30,160
is about so

1247
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,920
and here's what's crazy as far as

1248
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,400
medical medium information has become a

1249
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,960
law

1250
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:36,640
in natural health there's so many pieces

1251
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:38,480
of it out there now

1252
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:40,400
that doesn't come from a study or

1253
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,520
anything it comes from these books but

1254
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:44,319
yet doctors

1255
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,880
consider it law now it's like holistic

1256
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:46,960
law

1257
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:48,720
so there's so many tools being used

1258
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:51,040
celery juice being one of them

1259
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:52,480
that doesn't that wasn't out there

1260
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:53,839
because of any study

1261
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:55,599
it's out there because millions of

1262
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:57,839
people got their lives back and they

1263
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:59,760
healed and people got out of wheelchairs

1264
00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:02,160
the heavy metal detox smoothie

1265
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:04,079
is legendary for recovering people and

1266
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:05,760
giving people their lives back

1267
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:07,359
and there's something to be said about

1268
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:09,119
that so you guys i got bananas

1269
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:11,280
wild blueberries frozen wild blueberries

1270
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:13,680
in here i got cilantro in here i

1271
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:14,400

1272
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,240

i love putting some orange in here this

1274
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:21,440
is so great

1275
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:22,880
and um and so it's not a belief system

1276
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:26,240
medical medium information

1277
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:28,720
it comes from above since i was age 4

1278
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:30,319
i'm just the messenger that's why more

1279
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:31,359
people have healed of medical medium

1280
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:34,000
information

1281
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:35,680
than anything else in holistic health

1282
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,640
yet in our history

1283
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:39,680
that's a fact i can't change it you

1284
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:42,720

1285
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:44,000
nobody can change it it's just a fact

1286
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,920
more people have reversed their

1287
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,359
conditions and diseases with celery

1288
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:48,960
juice and other medical medium tools

1289
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:51,599
than any other place

1290
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:52,560
on the planet i'm not boasting i'm just

1291
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:55,200

it's around the world and people are

1311
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:30,800
using it so i'm also going to put a

1312
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:32,480
couple of other things in here this is

1313
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:34,319
barley grass juice powder now this is

1314
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:35,760
the vimergy barley grass juice powder

1315
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:39,280
it's the only one i trust

1316
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:41,920
v is in victor i m as in mary e-r-g-y

1317
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:43,920
okay that's the only one i trust it's

1318
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:45,599
the best one there ever is out there if

1319
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:47,599
there was a better one i would use it

1320
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:49,359
if there's a better one i would use it

1321
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:50,720
simple as that putting a teaspoon of the

1322
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:52,160
barley grass juice powder in here

1323
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:53,280
because it's part of how you get the

1324
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:56,240
metals out

1325
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:57,760
so there's the barley grass juice powder

1326
00:44:56,240 --> 00:45:00,880
right there

1327
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:04,880
so now i'm going to do the spirulina now

1328
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:06,960
i used to like uh pacific spirulina

1329
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:08,319
i don't like it anymore because it's not

1330
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:11,119
the best quality

1331
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:12,079
in my opinion it's not the best quality

1332
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:14,960
i've ever seen

1333
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:16,560
is the kind that vimergy has and that's

1334
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:17,359
the best quality spirulina i've ever

1335
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:19,040
seen

1336
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:20,240
so i'm putting a teaspoon of spirulina

1337
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:21,920
in here too if you don't know the

1338
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:25,119

out there and um

1348
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:43,520

i'm going to put a little

1352
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:50,240
uh even though i put wild blueberries in

1353
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:50,880
there i'm going to throw a little bit of

1354
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:53,040
the

1355
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:54,720

too

1357
00:45:54,720 --> 00:46:01,359
but by far the best stuff on the market

1358
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:02,400
i've ever found out all the companies

1359
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:04,720
and brands

1360
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:06,319
that i've actually vetted this is the

1361
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:08,319
best one there is

1362
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:09,760
just for the record so i got the heavy

1363
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:12,480

1366
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:20,240
that gets metals out of the brain

1367
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:22,160
that's what you have to realize why do

1368
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:22,880
people get focus and concentration

1369
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,640

00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:27,680

and it's wise and it's a mystery toxic

1376
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:40,960
heavy metals

1377
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:42,720
mercury aluminum are the dominating ones

1378
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:46,000
inside people's brains

1379
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:48,880

1391
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:19,200

all metal removers working together

so that metal doesn't get displaced it's

1400
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:39,119
