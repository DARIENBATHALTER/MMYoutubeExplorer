[209.12 - 213.04] hike they came back they're like
[210.56 - 214.40] i'm transformed yeah transformed from
[213.04 - 214.96] that did they have the celery juice

[224.16 - 226.96] everything and they're just like i'm
[225.20 - 228.48] transformed just from that alone right
[226.96 - 229.60] yeah because we get we get so in our
[228.48 - 230.88] heads i mean look
[229.60 - 232.32] i mean look at the work everybody's
[230.88 - 233.68] doing everybody's working everybody's
[232.32 - 234.96] working so hard on everything their
[233.68 - 236.48] projects i mean noah's like probably
[234.96 - 238.48] cranking out the music
[236.48 - 241.20] it's like you know there's a lot going
[238.48 - 244.00] on so getting getting that mind right is
[241.20 - 245.36] yeah but i think even when i am like
[244.00 - 247.36] doing a ton of music
[245.36 - 248.40] and i'm working really hard lou knows
[247.36 - 252.32] this as well like
[248.40 - 255.68] i tend to actually get in my fields
[252.32 - 257.68] and get depressed and get anxiety
[255.68 - 259.52] but the one time that like right now i'm
[257.68 - 262.16] feeling great because i'm
[259.52 - 262.88] working out every day i'm doing my best
[262.16 - 265.52] to like
[262.88 - 267.20] you know eat really healthy i actually
[265.52 - 269.84] made cake last night that doesn't count
[267.20 - 272.08] but like like i do my best to like
[269.84 - 275.20] because the only time i actually
[272.08 - 279.68] feel right and feel like i can like
[275.20 - 281.60] create well communicate well
[279.68 - 283.20] is whenever i'm eating healthy and
[281.60 - 285.52] exercising every day
[283.20 - 287.92] like without going to the gym like i
[285.52 - 289.20] wake up like so drowsy and like i
[287.92 - 291.36] i don't know there's just something
[289.20 - 294.00] about that that completely opens
[291.36 - 295.04] your mind yeah you're moving your blood
[294.00 - 296.56] you're circulating
[295.04 - 298.32] toxins that are floating around in there
[296.56 - 299.04] because what happens is those toxins
[298.32 - 300.80] just build up
[299.04 - 302.48] and they they build up they get into the
[300.80 - 303.92] brain they sit inside the liver
[302.48 - 305.12] then your liver gets stagnant and
[303.92 - 306.88] sluggish and then you're eating things
[305.12 - 308.08] you're not supposed to eat well well
[306.88 - 309.20] whatever someone might think they're
[308.08 - 310.56] supposed to eat things and then so
[309.20 - 312.64] whatever but you're eating things that
[310.56 - 314.64] may not be good for your liver
[312.64 - 316.16] and then it's getting really sluggish
[314.64 - 317.52] and then all of a sudden you're dragging
[316.16 - 319.12] and you're just like dragging your butt
[317.52 - 320.88] you wake up the morning you don't feel
[319.12 - 321.68] clear you don't feel good you get
[320.88 - 324.08] depressed
[321.68 - 325.52] for no reason or and all that just
[324.08 - 327.20] starts kicking in and really
[325.52 - 328.40] it's about moving those toxins through
[327.20 - 329.44] and everything celery cheese is a big
[328.40 - 331.28] piece of it it's why
[329.44 - 333.52] it's why spirit of compassion brought
[331.28 - 335.68] celery juice to the world because
[333.52 - 337.52] it it gets it helps people get all that
[335.68 - 339.28] going it's just it's part of it
[337.52 - 340.80] let's elaborate on that spirit of
[339.28 - 343.04] compassion yeah yeah
[340.80 - 344.88] so medical medium where does that come
[343.04 - 345.76] from well it comes from my my
[344.88 - 347.68] great-grandfather
[345.76 - 349.28] uh named me the medical medium when i
[347.68 - 351.04] was a child so that's when when i got to
[349.28 - 352.24] receive the gift of hearing a voice
[351.04 - 353.68] perfectly clear that tells me what's
[352.24 - 354.72] going on with somebody's health so
[353.68 - 356.40] anybody around me
[354.72 - 358.72] yeah that's how it all started yeah so
[356.40 - 360.88] then i dedicated my life doing this work
[358.72 - 362.16] the whole time helping out thousands and
[360.88 - 363.04] tens of thousands of people over the
[362.16 - 365.60] decade
[363.04 - 366.96] over the decades and then eventually
[365.60 - 367.68] spirit of compassion said you have to
[366.96 - 370.00] put this all
[367.68 - 371.20] in in writing yeah so then i published
[370.00 - 372.56] the books yeah and that's
[371.20 - 374.08] what happened the books are out there
[372.56 - 374.64] millions of people around the world have
[374.08 - 376.08] them
[374.64 - 377.92] they're moving their lives forward the
[376.08 - 378.48] celery juice is one of the tools one of
[377.92 - 381.28] those
[378.48 - 382.00] those hidden tools and that that's just
[381.28 - 384.56] no one ever
[382.00 - 385.68] knew that this could really change the
[384.56 - 387.28] lives of so many people
[385.68 - 389.12] millions right now around the world are
[387.28 - 390.00] healing from it yeah they're they're
[389.12 - 392.24] they're healing
[390.00 - 394.00] diseases illnesses symptoms they've they
[392.24 - 396.56] couldn't it was unimaginable to get
[394.00 - 398.40] rid of yeah celery juice is part of that
[396.56 - 399.68] and spirit of compassion the voice i
[398.40 - 401.12] hear because that's that's what the
[399.68 - 401.92] voice told me it's the spirit of
[401.12 - 403.76] compassion
[401.92 - 405.20] yeah and um and that's what i've been
[403.76 - 405.68] doing my whole life listening to that
[405.20 - 408.00] voice
[405.68 - 409.52] when you say you hear a voice right yeah
[408.00 - 413.04] yeah does it come in
[409.52 - 415.12] as like clear words to you like is it
[413.04 - 416.88] your mind that you're hearing are you
[415.12 - 419.52] hearing another
[416.88 - 421.04] like male or female or how does that
[419.52 - 423.52] come across you whenever you
[421.04 - 424.40] hear spirit i think you're the first
[423.52 - 426.80] person to ever
[424.40 - 427.44] ask that question in that way in that
[426.80 - 429.20] way like
[427.44 - 430.72] is it something you hear in your head
[429.20 - 433.60] yeah or is it something
[430.72 - 434.64] else and it's out it's from out here so
[433.60 - 437.28] it's like having like
[434.64 - 439.12] you hear me now clear right i hear the
[437.28 - 440.96] same way from the spirit of compassion
[439.12 - 441.84] from the voice i hear clear like you
[440.96 - 443.76] hear me right now
[441.84 - 445.44] the same voice every time same voice
[443.76 - 447.04] every time and it can be blocked a
[445.44 - 448.96] little bit too because it's coming into
[447.04 - 450.72] the right ear so i could take my hand
[448.96 - 452.56] and just do this and kind of block it a
[450.72 - 454.24] little bit because it's coming it's real
[452.56 - 457.20] time it's in real time
[454.24 - 458.88] right now anytime it's coming through
[457.20 - 460.56] yeah and that's how it works so it's not
[458.88 - 462.16] in my head it's not like i'm channeling
[460.56 - 464.08] i'm not channeling anything
[462.16 - 466.00] or it's not my intuition and i'm kind of
[464.08 - 467.20] thinking what does my voice inside of me
[466.00 - 469.28] say or what is that
[467.20 - 470.96] what does that child voice in myself say
[469.28 - 473.04] or what is no that's not it at all
[470.96 - 474.96] it's a voice that's been basically
[473.04 - 476.00] torturing me since i was four years old
[474.96 - 478.56] so there you go so
[476.00 - 479.76] you like be on a date and you say
[478.56 - 482.24] something wrong and then the spirit of
[479.76 - 484.72] compassion is like no
[482.24 - 486.32] not that exactly always correcting me
[484.72 - 488.24] always trying to keep me you know
[486.32 - 489.60] making sure i say the right things all
[488.24 - 491.44] of that because
[489.60 - 493.44] what it is it's about i work for
[491.44 - 494.88] everybody i work for everybody who's
[493.44 - 496.64] chronically ill i work for people who
[494.88 - 499.12] are struggling with anxiety crippling
[496.64 - 499.68] anxiety and depression exactly all these
[499.12 - 503.20] things and
[499.68 - 504.96] let's work together after this interview
[503.20 - 507.04] hey look we'd love to and aches and
[504.96 - 508.24] pains and all the fatigue and all the
[507.04 - 509.04] mystery fatigue do you know anybody
[508.24 - 510.96] who's mystery
[509.04 - 512.88] tired they're like more tired than just
[510.96 - 514.72] tired parents
[512.88 - 516.32] yeah absolutely i feel like i've been
[514.72 - 520.72] slept since 2005.
[516.32 - 522.24] so like yeah
[520.72 - 524.32] we have to get strong we got to get that
[522.24 - 525.84] energy back and so there's so many
[524.32 - 527.04] people dealing with all these things
[525.84 - 528.64] they're going around but we're all
[527.04 - 531.20] supposed to pretend it's normal
[528.64 - 533.04] we're all supposed to pretend that it's
[531.20 - 535.28] a normal occurrence happening
[533.04 - 537.04] yeah that we're supposed to be sick now
[535.28 - 538.24] everybody's supposed to have a symptom
[537.04 - 539.68] or something wrong with them that's how
[538.24 - 541.04] we're that's kind of how we're go like
[539.68 - 542.48] it's the new normal
[541.04 - 544.24] oh what do you got you got a thyroid
[542.48 - 545.68] problem oh whatever it actually is it's
[544.24 - 547.28] scary yeah right yeah
[545.68 - 548.80] and so but it's not supposed to be like
[547.28 - 550.32] no and that's
[548.80 - 551.92] it's like a constant complain of
[550.32 - 554.32] illnesses exactly
[551.92 - 556.16] i mean you know as complaints can be but
[554.32 - 559.52] i mean i guess we're conditioned
[556.16 - 560.72] to be negative as a race anyway yeah so
[559.52 - 562.80] i mean if we were conditioned to be
[560.72 - 564.08] positive then a negative negative
[562.80 - 566.08] situation comes in we would kind of
[564.08 - 567.60] brush it off because now we brush off
[566.08 - 569.44] the positive situations as it's because
[567.60 - 570.96] it doesn't feel right to us
[569.44 - 574.08] because it's not the normal feeling of
[570.96 - 576.48] it exactly um so celery juice
[574.08 - 577.76] in terms of is it the placebo effect is
[576.48 - 579.76] it the actual juice that's healing
[577.76 - 581.60] people or is it people believing
[579.76 - 584.00] that this or is it a mixture of both
[581.60 - 585.28] well when did placebo fix
[584.00 - 587.04] the world i don't get it wouldn't
[585.28 - 589.36] everybody be better placebo worked
[587.04 - 591.76] true think about this a placebo worked
[589.36 - 592.96] yeah they would have ingeniously
[591.76 - 594.80] you know science of research would have
[592.96 - 595.68] placeboed everybody out to get to get
[594.80 - 598.08] them better
[595.68 - 599.28] they'd all be better everybody would be
[598.08 - 601.28] better yeah because
[599.28 - 602.80] all you need is any kind of placebo tell
[601.28 - 604.24] somebody that this pill works if it
[602.80 - 606.40] doesn't they should be better
[604.24 - 607.68] yeah it's a placebo yeah but see so
[606.40 - 610.80] placebo doesn't work
[607.68 - 613.36] it never did yeah if it did i mean
[610.80 - 615.20] i could hand you like a candy corn okay
[613.36 - 616.24] a little piece of candy and say hey like
[615.20 - 618.40] you know what i mean we can
[616.24 - 620.80] it just you can't you you can't get
[618.40 - 623.52] better on that yeah
[620.80 - 624.40] i believed it and for a fact 100 it
[623.52 - 626.96] would
[624.40 - 628.96] well because in terms of how i live my
[626.96 - 630.96] universe if i believe things for fact
[628.96 - 632.40] yeah they shall appear well you know
[630.96 - 634.48] what when you're when you're
[632.40 - 635.84] when you're bedridden yeah and you can't
[634.48 - 637.36] push out of bed
[635.84 - 639.52] and your body your body's covered with
[637.36 - 639.92] exomar psoriasis yeah and you're really
[639.52 - 642.32] sick
[639.92 - 642.96] and and there's no placebo that can fix
[642.32 - 644.72] that yeah
[642.96 - 646.40] it just isn't i don't care what doctor
[644.72 - 648.48] whoever comes in and says
[646.40 - 649.60] take this pill and it's a placebo yeah
[648.48 - 650.56] you're going to get out of bed you're
[649.60 - 652.00] going to be able to function you're
[650.56 - 653.84] going to get rid of that brain fog and
[652.00 - 655.36] no that brain fog stays no matter
[653.84 - 657.04] what's happening that's the difference
[655.36 - 658.72] when you're chronically sick
[657.04 - 660.40] man it's a whole other story and i've
[658.72 - 662.08] been batting for the chronically sick
[660.40 - 662.48] that's the whole thing i'm the messenger
[662.08 - 664.16] to
[662.48 - 666.08] kind of have their back because they've
[664.16 - 667.92] been swept under the carpet and
[666.08 - 669.36] kind of pushed aside for the decades
[667.92 - 671.84] it's been unbelievable right
[669.36 - 673.20] what has happened and what's going on is
[671.84 - 675.84] science and research
[673.20 - 677.92] hasn't actually had the answers yet for
[675.84 - 680.00] people who are sick on that level
[677.92 - 680.96] but celery juice big difference what
[680.00 - 682.80] goes on you know it's
[680.96 - 684.40] it's it's hey there's people who tried
[682.80 - 687.36] everything done everything
[684.40 - 689.28] every diet every kind of lifestyle every
[687.36 - 690.80] kind of supplement they tried all kinds
[689.28 - 691.68] of modalities they tried everything
[690.80 - 693.76] right
[691.68 - 695.52] and they're still stuck but when they
[693.76 - 697.04] bring celery juice in
[695.52 - 699.68] they're getting better and those are
[697.04 - 701.44] people that were like skeptical about it
[699.68 - 702.88] yeah we're skeptical i mean i know
[701.44 - 704.64] people are like that's not gonna work
[702.88 - 705.84] celery juice i chew on celery i have it
[704.64 - 707.52] in my tuna salad
[705.84 - 708.96] celery's not gonna fix me and they're
[707.52 - 710.32] drinking the celery juice for two days
[708.96 - 712.24] and they're negative about it
[710.32 - 714.24] and they're like oh my god my hip is
[712.24 - 716.16] getting better what the hell is going on
[714.24 - 717.36] here this is the freakiest thing ever
[716.16 - 719.04] that's how it's working and it's
[717.36 - 721.20] spreading it's spreading like wildfire
[719.04 - 723.68] you gotta remember something you guys
[721.20 - 725.20] there's no money behind it celery juice
[723.68 - 728.32] isn't a trend because
[725.20 - 729.36] it was like backed by tons of money to
[728.32 - 731.84] make it trendy
[729.36 - 732.40] yeah celery juice is trendy because the
[731.84 - 735.12] stuff
[732.40 - 736.56] works yeah it just does i think you've
[735.12 - 737.36] single-handedly pushed the price of
[736.56 - 741.20] celery up
[737.36 - 743.60] in los angeles yeah yeah yeah yeah
[741.20 - 747.20] no it's crazy it's been you should come
[743.60 - 747.20] out with your own line of celery
[747.60 - 752.72] your own farm of celery
[751.12 - 755.68] is that is there a difference for you
[752.72 - 758.40] between say organic celery and kind of
[755.68 - 760.40] normal normal celery or celery or that
[758.40 - 762.00] or organic fruits in general do you have
[760.40 - 764.64] to juice it what if you just
[762.00 - 766.00] eat a celery you can eat it it's good
[764.64 - 767.36] for you it's not going to fix anything
[766.00 - 768.56] better juice it yeah it's not going to
[767.36 - 772.24] fix anything eating
[768.56 - 774.88] squeeze the [ __ ] out of it drink it yeah
[772.24 - 775.52] it never fixed anybody eating it it just
[774.88 - 777.28] hasn't
[775.52 - 778.72] it but it's the juicing has to be
[777.28 - 781.36] juicing on an empty stomach
[778.72 - 782.48] yeah that's you know 16 ounces minimum
[781.36 - 785.60] on an empty stomach
[782.48 - 787.12] 32 ounces and you're moving forward i
[785.60 - 787.76] mean you're moving forward that's a lot
[787.12 - 791.20] of celery
[787.76 - 792.96] 64 ounces yeah if you really have
[791.20 - 794.40] something that's major going on with
[792.96 - 796.56] your health is that every day
[794.40 - 798.08] gross does it taste gross sometimes it's
[796.56 - 801.12] like sweet and salty
[798.08 - 802.72] sometimes it's like just too astringent
[801.12 - 804.72] and like bittersweet i'm asking because
[802.72 - 805.68] i'm gonna go home and start chugging
[804.72 - 807.84] celery juice
[805.68 - 809.60] no joke i need it the celery's been
[807.84 - 811.12] pretty good lately out here in la
[809.60 - 812.72] like it's pretty good it hasn't been so
[811.12 - 813.60] astringent it's been pretty good i think
[812.72 - 815.12] you're gonna like it
[813.60 - 817.76] all right i'm doing it the funniest
[815.12 - 819.12] thing is i i've never eaten celery ever
[817.76 - 821.36] me either i feel like it tastes like
[819.12 - 822.56] [ __ ] i hate celery but if it's dipped in
[821.36 - 824.16] ranch but noah
[822.56 - 829.52] when you juice it it actually tastes
[824.16 - 831.28] better than eating it really
[829.52 - 833.28] or something to make it better it has
[831.28 - 834.00] like a sweet taste to it when you drink
[833.28 - 835.76] it
[834.00 - 837.20] but yeah when i eat it like i have to
[835.76 - 838.00] like dip it in hummus or do some other
[837.20 - 842.56] [ __ ] to it but
[838.00 - 844.88] me lives it in ranch yeah
[842.56 - 846.64] exactly yeah i'm your worst nightmare
[844.88 - 849.36] i'm like chicken fingers
[846.64 - 850.88] like yeah pizza yeah i thought you were
[849.36 - 852.88] gonna give me a reading be like i'm
[850.88 - 856.08] sensing some chicken fingers
[852.88 - 859.28] in here i actually have a question
[856.08 - 862.88] okay so it says you're you
[859.28 - 866.32] really discovered like that you had this
[862.88 - 868.16] amazing gift when you were four
[866.32 - 869.36] yeah that's when it started at age four
[868.16 - 873.04] with your grandmother
[869.36 - 875.20] right there and um you just had
[873.04 - 876.72] you kept getting this feeling that she
[875.20 - 878.80] was sick with
[876.72 - 880.24] cancer well i couldn't avoid it because
[878.80 - 880.64] the information came through all the
[880.24 - 882.96] time
[880.64 - 884.64] so spirit spirit of compassion would say
[882.96 - 885.92] you know this is what she has going on
[884.64 - 887.36] and you know you're four years old you
[885.92 - 888.88] don't know what the words mean
[887.36 - 891.52] so you're trying to pronounce my
[888.88 - 894.16] grandfather died when i was four of lung
[891.52 - 895.76] cancer so that's why
[894.16 - 897.28] yeah so it's crazy so that's why i
[895.76 - 899.44] wanted to ask you like
[897.28 - 900.72] when you got that did you did they take
[899.44 - 902.72] her to the doctor
[900.72 - 903.92] yeah a few a few weeks later a few weeks
[902.72 - 904.72] because she was fine she didn't have a
[903.92 - 906.32] symptom
[904.72 - 908.24] there was no symptoms she was perfectly
[906.32 - 911.20] fine but it took about three weeks
[908.24 - 912.80] later and took her in because i was
[911.20 - 915.12] saying it too much
[912.80 - 915.92] and so so someone spoke to you about
[915.12 - 918.88] what your
[915.92 - 919.44] your gran your man of compassion yeah
[918.88 - 920.88] had
[919.44 - 922.32] yeah i'm bringing spirit of compassion
[920.88 - 924.08] was telling me oh my god you know
[922.32 - 926.48] pronounce lung cancer did you name
[924.08 - 927.76] spirit spirit of compassion or is that
[926.48 - 929.68] that came from the voice
[927.76 - 931.44] spirit of the comp spirit of compassion
[929.68 - 931.68] when i asked so many questions are you
[931.44 - 933.84] an
[931.68 - 935.76] angel are you just someone are you a
[933.84 - 936.88] ghost it's not a ghost
[935.76 - 939.12] i'm not talking to you you know it's
[936.88 - 940.40] amazing until this day
[939.12 - 942.24] it's funny there's there's there's a
[940.40 - 943.92] whole group of people in the world
[942.24 - 945.28] that have healed from the medical medium
[943.92 - 947.20] information that no
[945.28 - 948.56] it's not a ghost they know what the
[947.20 - 950.80] information is because
[948.56 - 952.96] it's it's advanced medical information
[950.80 - 955.12] ahead of science and research right
[952.96 - 956.40] so what happens and doctors are using it
[955.12 - 958.24] all across this country and
[956.40 - 960.40] globally they're using it these books
[958.24 - 961.52] are all over doctor's offices you know
[960.40 - 963.12] all around the world
[961.52 - 965.20] and but then there's a group of people
[963.12 - 968.16] that thinks i'm the celery juice guy
[965.20 - 968.16] that talks to a ghost
[970.24 - 973.44] i mean i like that one too i think
[971.84 - 975.36] that's cool that's cool and
[973.44 - 976.96] but the bottom line is it's yeah spirit
[975.36 - 980.08] of compassion i got that
[976.96 - 982.32] um from spirit you know i've once in a
[980.08 - 984.56] while i'll say spirit to make it short
[982.32 - 986.16] but every time i make it short like that
[984.56 - 986.64] then some people like oh you talked to a
[986.16 - 988.40] ghost
[986.64 - 989.60] yeah but spirit of compassion is like
[988.40 - 991.04] you know i've always told you it's
[989.60 - 992.40] spirit of compassion why are you saying
[991.04 - 992.72] spirit you're cutting me short yeah you

[1006.16 - 1009.92] always say like why me
[1008.16 - 1012.16] because i'm not really the the most
[1009.92 - 1013.52] spiritual guy i mean i know people
[1012.16 - 1014.96] they're really spiritual connected
[1013.52 - 1016.48] spiritually connected i mean they're
[1014.96 - 1017.92] like on mountaintops
[1016.48 - 1019.84] they're like they're like praying
[1017.92 - 1021.68] they're like 40-day fasting
[1019.84 - 1023.20] they're they're breathing air and that's
[1021.68 - 1024.80] it you know like doing all kinds of
[1023.20 - 1026.48] things right like you know
[1024.80 - 1027.68] and you know and they're in retreats
[1026.48 - 1029.28] around the globe and they're in the
[1027.68 - 1030.80] amazon and they're just like they just
[1029.28 - 1031.92] disappear and they come out and they're
[1030.80 - 1032.96] just coming out they come out of the
[1031.92 - 1034.80] amazon naked
[1032.96 - 1036.00] after like two weeks of being bitten by
[1034.80 - 1038.32] mosquitoes they're like
[1036.00 - 1040.56] they're connected right naked vibes yeah
[1038.32 - 1042.40] yeah they just do things like that right
[1040.56 - 1044.08] me you know it's not like that and i
[1042.40 - 1045.52] always say the spirit well how come me
[1044.08 - 1048.08] and spirit said because
[1045.52 - 1049.04] you can handle it because it's really
[1048.08 - 1051.20] difficult
[1049.04 - 1052.16] it's really difficult on a way because
[1051.20 - 1054.24] you can't
[1052.16 - 1056.56] you don't live a normal life whatsoever
[1054.24 - 1058.32] yeah and i mean a normal life i mean
[1056.56 - 1059.76] you're just that's it when it started
[1058.32 - 1062.16] happening it was
[1059.76 - 1063.52] it was like okay you know look i
[1062.16 - 1065.20] couldn't pursue anything else couldn't
[1063.52 - 1066.00] pursue a dream couldn't pursue anything
[1065.20 - 1068.88] else couldn't do
[1066.00 - 1070.00] anything it had to be this only there
[1068.88 - 1072.40] was no way out
[1070.00 - 1074.16] wow and it takes it takes a skin for
[1072.40 - 1075.12] this yeah and i didn't know i have the
[1074.16 - 1077.60] skin for it but
[1075.12 - 1078.16] but apparently i i might have it because
[1077.60 - 1080.64] i'm still
[1078.16 - 1081.76] here and i didn't jump ship no so it's
[1080.64 - 1083.92] yeah
[1081.76 - 1086.32] does the spirit uh of compassion ever
[1083.92 - 1088.96] talk to you about was it predetermined
[1086.32 - 1089.68] you were supposed to was this pre-birth
[1088.96 - 1091.60] or is it
[1089.68 - 1092.88] of a spiritual nature or did they say
[1091.60 - 1094.16] where they why they come to you where
[1092.88 - 1096.16] they come from
[1094.16 - 1097.60] what plane they live on i think it's the
[1096.16 - 1099.12] strongest that that can handle the
[1097.60 - 1100.56] strongest that survive it
[1099.12 - 1102.40] yeah you know because when i when i
[1100.56 - 1104.16] asked questions a lot of that it was
[1102.40 - 1105.12] given to others but they didn't stay
[1104.16 - 1108.16] here long
[1105.12 - 1110.32] yeah because it wasn't easy
[1108.16 - 1112.08] the teenage time is the hardest when
[1110.32 - 1113.92] you're a teenager with it that's when
[1112.08 - 1115.36] you lose it that's when you lose your
[1113.92 - 1117.60] mind with this gift yeah
[1115.36 - 1119.20] because you want to like just be normal
[1117.60 - 1120.80] you want to do normal things you want to
[1119.20 - 1122.16] have fun and you're hearing a voice
[1120.80 - 1123.12] telling you that someone's got a brain
[1122.16 - 1125.52] tumor you hear a voice
[1123.12 - 1127.04] non-stop you go into a crowd and then
[1125.52 - 1128.48] everybody in that crowd is being
[1127.04 - 1130.48] assessed by spirit and
[1128.48 - 1132.72] information is flying in coming in you
[1130.48 - 1133.68] know if i get on if i get on a plane or
[1132.72 - 1136.16] something like that
[1133.68 - 1137.84] everybody on that plane i mean i was on
[1136.16 - 1139.76] a plane one time
[1137.84 - 1141.20] and uh you know my assistant was sitting
[1139.76 - 1142.32] with me because i have to go with an
[1141.20 - 1144.48] assistant because
[1142.32 - 1145.36] it's just too much with the readings and
[1144.48 - 1148.88] and all of that
[1145.36 - 1151.28] and so so i'm i'm on the plane and
[1148.88 - 1152.64] there's all this commotion going on all
[1151.28 - 1154.16] this commotion from spirit
[1152.64 - 1156.08] well actually well there's commotion
[1154.16 - 1157.44] going on on a plane like stewardesses
[1156.08 - 1158.72] are running around there's all this
[1157.44 - 1161.20] stuff happening
[1158.72 - 1162.80] and spirit tells me that somebody in the
[1161.20 - 1164.48] back is seizuring
[1162.80 - 1165.76] so they're seizuring in the back wow
[1164.48 - 1167.44] it's like it's a guy back there at
[1165.76 - 1169.36] seizuring and everything so
[1167.44 - 1171.20] i tell my assistant so the finally
[1169.36 - 1172.72] everything calms down after about 20
[1171.20 - 1173.92] minutes half an hour or so
[1172.72 - 1175.44] and then my assistant asked the
[1173.92 - 1177.36] stewardess what's happening and she goes
[1175.44 - 1180.16] there's a man back there seizuring
[1177.36 - 1181.68] and it's it's always there and i can't
[1180.16 - 1182.72] get away from it and when i was a
[1181.68 - 1184.40] teenager
[1182.72 - 1185.76] just think about that that's a difficult
[1184.40 - 1188.08] time for everybody
[1185.76 - 1190.24] when this is all you have to do or all
[1188.08 - 1191.68] you you all you're supposed to do you
[1190.24 - 1192.24] can't get out of it you can't get away
[1191.68 - 1193.92] from it
[1192.24 - 1195.28] you got to be strong yeah i mean there
[1193.92 - 1198.40] was times like i'm not
[1195.28 - 1199.60] i'm not going on yeah with this i'm i
[1198.40 - 1200.88] might jump ship so
[1199.60 - 1202.80] but you know what i hung in there and i
[1200.88 - 1206.32] think that's what predetermined it
[1202.80 - 1208.40] it's like okay picking you you can
[1206.32 - 1209.76] probably handle it for some reason yeah
[1208.40 - 1211.36] who knows what that reason is
[1209.76 - 1212.96] yeah but yeah that's how it went i mean
[1211.36 - 1216.16] obviously the reason is this
[1212.96 - 1219.20] yeah spreads spread the knowledge of of
[1216.16 - 1219.52] health so is it only the the medical
[1219.20 - 1221.12] that
[1219.52 - 1222.80] the the spirit of compassion speaks to
[1221.12 - 1225.12] you about it's the most important so if
[1222.80 - 1229.04] you was to say eat a pizza it'd be like
[1225.12 - 1231.52] nah bro not today don't eat that
[1229.04 - 1232.32] well you know what of course like small
[1231.52 - 1234.08] talk like that
[1232.32 - 1236.08] yeah you know it's always there with
[1234.08 - 1238.56] spirit absolutely don't worry
[1236.08 - 1239.84] spirit's never short for all that stuff
[1238.56 - 1242.16] yeah without a doubt
[1239.84 - 1243.92] but the medical is the most important
[1242.16 - 1245.92] because if you don't feel good
[1243.92 - 1247.68] yeah if you're if you can't like do your
[1245.92 - 1249.12] work if you can't live your life
[1247.68 - 1251.28] if you can't be happy in your
[1249.12 - 1252.96] relationship because you're sick if
[1251.28 - 1254.64] if you just got diagnosed with something
[1252.96 - 1256.56] and and the doctor said well
[1254.64 - 1258.00] hey your body's attacking itself because
[1256.56 - 1260.32] you got an autoimmune disease
[1258.00 - 1261.68] which actually is incorrect how it works
[1260.32 - 1262.64] the body doesn't attack itself but the
[1261.68 - 1264.56] point is when you're
[1262.64 - 1266.80] driving from that doctor's office and
[1264.56 - 1268.56] you've been told you got something yeah
[1266.80 - 1270.56] you're miserable you're in misery it
[1268.56 - 1272.32] takes over so many people are like oh my
[1270.56 - 1273.28] god what is this now i got like thyroid
[1272.32 - 1275.60] problems now
[1273.28 - 1276.64] or what do i have i have this and and
[1275.60 - 1279.44] it's hard so
[1276.64 - 1280.88] medical is the most important and that's
[1279.44 - 1282.32] the whole point it's your health it's
[1280.88 - 1285.52] the most important thing yeah
[1282.32 - 1288.64] i agree yeah yeah so in terms of say
[1285.52 - 1291.44] for example um can can diet uh
[1288.64 - 1292.24] make you know aid in anxiety and
[1291.44 - 1294.24] depression
[1292.24 - 1296.24] and all these type of aspects to the
[1294.24 - 1298.72] human you know psyche
[1296.24 - 1300.00] or uh does it have an adverse effect on
[1298.72 - 1303.20] it should i say
[1300.00 - 1304.40] well it has diet plays a role in getting
[1303.20 - 1306.64] those things better
[1304.40 - 1308.16] yeah but the problem is science of
[1306.64 - 1310.48] research doesn't know
[1308.16 - 1311.52] why or how someone can get better why
[1310.48 - 1313.12] food does work
[1311.52 - 1315.52] doesn't work we're still in those really
[1313.12 - 1318.16] early stages of understanding it
[1315.52 - 1320.00] what's the cause of anxiety unknown yeah
[1318.16 - 1320.40] it's unknown right now right that's what
[1320.00 - 1321.92] it is
[1320.40 - 1324.16] well spirit of compassion knows the
[1321.92 - 1325.84] cause of anxiety mystery anxiety
[1324.16 - 1327.52] the cause i write it in the books i put
[1325.84 - 1328.72] it in the books the information is there
[1327.52 - 1330.48] people have been able to heal it because
[1328.72 - 1331.36] they know the cause that's what i've
[1330.48 - 1333.36] been able to do
[1331.36 - 1335.44] is with this voice that comes to me i've
[1333.36 - 1335.92] been able to bring that information
[1335.44 - 1337.68] forward
[1335.92 - 1339.20] and it's never happened before it's
[1337.68 - 1341.12] never happened yeah there's an actual
[1339.20 - 1342.72] cost to anxiety there's actual cause for
[1341.12 - 1344.96] all these illnesses for aches and pains
[1342.72 - 1347.12] tingles and numbness ringing in the ears
[1344.96 - 1349.20] you know all of that you know everything
[1347.12 - 1351.04] from restless leg syndrome to neuropathy
[1349.20 - 1352.96] to headaches migraines they're they have
[1351.04 - 1355.12] no causes for all yeah
[1352.96 - 1356.08] why do your ears ring mind you that
[1355.12 - 1357.92] sometimes
[1356.08 - 1360.08] like am i is there something wrong with
[1357.92 - 1362.08] me well
[1360.08 - 1364.00] honestly if there is please don't tell
[1362.08 - 1365.04] me because i'm a really big
[1364.00 - 1368.48] hypochondriac
[1365.04 - 1370.56] and i go to my cardiologist and have him
[1368.48 - 1372.32] take blood all the time and he's always
[1370.56 - 1373.60] like noah you've got to stop coming
[1372.32 - 1376.00] because you're okay
[1373.60 - 1376.72] yeah and so like i'm really crazy about
[1376.00 - 1379.04] that stuff so
[1376.72 - 1380.56] don't tell me if something's wrong but
[1379.04 - 1383.20] how come that does happen
[1380.56 - 1384.80] what is that it stops after a second
[1383.20 - 1385.44] yeah but that's different that's like
[1384.80 - 1387.92] just
[1385.44 - 1389.60] little little earrings comes and goes
[1387.92 - 1391.20] once in a while
[1389.60 - 1394.96] no maybe that's your spirit of
[1391.20 - 1398.64] compassion trying to get through
[1394.96 - 1400.00] i have i do have to say like for me
[1398.64 - 1402.64] i think we've talked about this before
[1400.00 - 1406.32] my dad is very spiritual
[1402.64 - 1409.44] and as am i so like i different from you
[1406.32 - 1411.12] my whatever my like feelings that i get
[1409.44 - 1412.96] or not like
[1411.12 - 1414.80] so standing next to somebody and
[1412.96 - 1416.56] somebody will tell me what's going on in
[1414.80 - 1418.72] their lives but like i've definitely
[1416.56 - 1420.72] always had like a more spiritual
[1418.72 - 1421.36] connection where i've been able to like
[1420.72 - 1423.12] with
[1421.36 - 1425.04] being in my house or like things like
[1423.12 - 1426.88] that or like i just have very strong
[1425.04 - 1429.04] connection with my grandfather who i
[1426.88 - 1431.20] know for a fact that i like get
[1429.04 - 1433.04] these message from messages from you're
[1431.20 - 1436.08] connected i'm very connected
[1433.04 - 1437.76] my dad was very connected my whole life
[1436.08 - 1439.12] and like i think that's where i
[1437.76 - 1441.60] definitely get that from
[1439.12 - 1443.52] yeah and like i don't know i think
[1441.60 - 1444.96] that's always been like when i was a kid
[1443.52 - 1445.84] i was actually like i would get kind of
[1444.96 - 1448.40] freaked out
[1445.84 - 1450.88] because like i lived in a very like
[1448.40 - 1452.56] historical home in a historical part of
[1450.88 - 1453.84] nashville where there was a battle of
[1452.56 - 1456.88] franklin and
[1453.84 - 1458.40] all the energy is so actually heavy i
[1456.88 - 1460.40] know that's like
[1458.40 - 1462.24] not your field of like vibes that you
[1460.40 - 1464.88] get but i that's just something that
[1462.24 - 1466.48] like i grew up with was like i would be
[1464.88 - 1469.36] at home and i could like
[1466.48 - 1471.12] feel like oh my grandfather is like
[1469.36 - 1472.48] sending me like a message
[1471.12 - 1474.16] what do you think about that do you
[1472.48 - 1475.84] believe in that
[1474.16 - 1477.76] oh absolutely absolutely i mean i could
[1475.84 - 1479.36] use spirit for that i could use spirit
[1477.76 - 1481.52] for those things
[1479.36 - 1482.96] oh yeah i mean i can but it's it's never
[1481.52 - 1484.16] the most important
[1482.96 - 1486.64] when and i'm not saying that's not
[1484.16 - 1488.88] important that's important 1 000
[1486.64 - 1490.64] but when a mom can't get out of bed to
[1488.88 - 1493.20] take care of her three children
[1490.64 - 1493.84] and she loses her part-time job and
[1493.20 - 1495.92] she's like
[1493.84 - 1497.44] and she can't even barely walk or take a
[1495.92 - 1497.92] shower because that chronic fatigue hits
[1497.44 - 1500.40] her
[1497.92 - 1502.08] and no one nowhere can help her 20
[1500.40 - 1504.80] doctors 10 neurologists
[1502.08 - 1506.32] 10 cardiologists um everything
[1504.80 - 1506.64] information on the internet can't help
[1506.32 - 1509.92] her
[1506.64 - 1511.92] yep and that's the most important so
[1509.92 - 1513.92] that's what that's what the books have
[1511.92 - 1514.80] done it's for millions that are in that
[1513.92 - 1516.64] condition
[1514.80 - 1519.60] and that's why i have to keep on using
[1516.64 - 1521.36] that so if if i do take the time out
[1519.60 - 1522.96] and and go the other direction
[1521.36 - 1524.48] spiritually which i love to do don't get
[1522.96 - 1527.20] me wrong i love to do
[1524.48 - 1529.20] have you used spirit yeah absolutely
[1527.20 - 1530.88] absolutely i have for for all those
[1529.20 - 1533.60] different things exactly
[1530.88 - 1535.36] but once again the need is unbelievable
[1533.60 - 1536.48] there's a way there was a waiting list
[1535.36 - 1538.48] to talk to me
[1536.48 - 1539.84] back six years ago that was in the
[1538.48 - 1543.44] millions that's how many
[1539.84 - 1547.04] people are sick so i i i you know
[1543.44 - 1549.44] i feel guilty if i do the more
[1547.04 - 1551.28] fun spiritual connected stuff i feel
[1549.44 - 1552.08] guilty literally because there's so many
[1551.28 - 1553.76] children
[1552.08 - 1555.36] that are oh my god so many children are
[1553.76 - 1556.56] suffering and struggling yeah and they
[1555.36 - 1557.28] have the worst conditions meaning
[1556.56 - 1558.96] they're just
[1557.28 - 1560.72] literally and their whole bodies are
[1558.96 - 1562.56] covered with eczema and they can't even
[1560.72 - 1564.24] put you you can't even put a t-shirt on
[1562.56 - 1565.84] your son or your daughter because the
[1564.24 - 1567.28] eczema is taking over and
[1565.84 - 1568.88] you have to just live at home and you're
[1567.28 - 1569.84] look going to doctor's offices every
[1568.88 - 1572.00] single day like
[1569.84 - 1574.16] these kinds of things like you know and
[1572.00 - 1576.00] it's it's it's moms with like
[1574.16 - 1578.08] with anxiety that's so crippling they
[1576.00 - 1578.48] can't drive and it's all these things
[1578.08 - 1582.00] that
[1578.48 - 1583.76] that i had i have to like be focused on
[1582.00 - 1585.36] and get that information so when people
[1583.76 - 1587.60] tell me they go like you know like
[1585.36 - 1589.36] you know talk to me talk to me about you
[1587.60 - 1590.72] know the spiritual connection about this
[1589.36 - 1591.60] and tell me what what's going on in the
[1590.72 - 1594.80] universe
[1591.60 - 1596.08] tell me to all of it i can i can tap in
[1594.80 - 1598.64] without a doubt and ask spirit of
[1596.08 - 1601.12] compassion questions but then
[1598.64 - 1601.76] i feel like oh my god there's so there's
[1601.12 - 1604.40] so
[1601.76 - 1605.12] there's the weight the weight of the
[1604.40 - 1606.96] suffering
[1605.12 - 1608.88] yeah the struggling and you know when
[1606.96 - 1610.48] you feel good like you guys feel good

[1618.24 - 1620.08] friend or something you haven't talked
[1619.12 - 1620.88] to the wall and you're like what

[1631.04 - 1633.92] someone
[1631.84 - 1635.28] really get in touch with the people that

[1635.28 - 1638.56] their loved ones in different ways or
[1637.04 - 1640.32] what's happening in the moment like
[1638.56 - 1642.24] is the ringing in their ear some some
[1640.32 - 1643.60] something yeah a message coming through
[1642.24 - 1646.24] what was that dream
[1643.60 - 1647.84] you had the one that the one that like
[1646.24 - 1650.24] had so much meaning to it
[1647.84 - 1650.96] yeah i've totally had like dreams
[1650.24 - 1652.08] exactly yeah
[1650.96 - 1653.12] it's actually that's what i mentioned
[1652.08 - 1654.24] like that's why i looked right at you
[1653.12 - 1657.20] and said what is that dream
[1654.24 - 1658.56] it's like that dream is i love going
[1657.20 - 1659.84] into those dreams
[1658.56 - 1661.84] and talking spirit of compassion and
[1659.84 - 1663.44] being like what does her dream mean
[1661.84 - 1665.44] because that is like that's there's
[1663.44 - 1666.96] something there was it a past life
[1665.44 - 1668.72] was it something in the future that we
[1666.96 - 1670.56] don't know about was it something in the
[1668.72 - 1672.48] moment where it's about to happen or is
[1670.56 - 1674.40] it a direction where you're going to be
[1672.48 - 1675.52] focused on soon because of a passion
[1674.40 - 1677.76] inside of you is it
[1675.52 - 1679.28] healing a wound that you have from a few
[1677.76 - 1680.96] years ago from somebody
[1679.28 - 1683.44] is the dream about a wound that's
[1680.96 - 1685.20] healing because you had kind of a bad
[1683.44 - 1687.44] a betrayal going on or something some
[1685.20 - 1689.68] kind of trust was broken
[1687.44 - 1690.48] and all of that that's powerful stuff i
[1689.68 - 1693.12] love it
[1690.48 - 1693.52] i want to dedicate time on it i can't
[1693.12 - 1696.24] yeah
[1693.52 - 1697.12] i can't that's how it is it's funny
[1696.24 - 1699.76] because um
[1697.12 - 1700.16] i had a dream recently and i beat myself
[1699.76 - 1702.64] up
[1700.16 - 1704.56] for not remembering the detail of it but
[1702.64 - 1706.16] i i dreamed that i found the formula to
[1704.56 - 1707.20] see the other side while still being
[1706.16 - 1709.68] alive
[1707.20 - 1711.68] yeah and i saw the formula on some paper
[1709.68 - 1713.68] we were running all these weird tests
[1711.68 - 1716.00] like using human blood and [ __ ] like
[1713.68 - 1717.44] that and then all of a sudden you would
[1716.00 - 1717.84] have that dream i would have that dream
[1717.44 - 1720.24] right
[1717.84 - 1721.04] and they would have that dream and then
[1720.24 - 1723.20] literally
[1721.04 - 1724.08] um we did all those tests and it went on
[1723.20 - 1725.44] for ages and then
[1724.08 - 1727.44] there was just this paper and it was
[1725.44 - 1728.16] just believing you could see the other
[1727.44 - 1730.08] side
[1728.16 - 1731.20] but i couldn't remember what the formula
[1730.08 - 1735.04] was for it
[1731.20 - 1737.52] and i was like [ __ ] and it felt so real
[1735.04 - 1738.32] yeah yeah and there's there's reasons
[1737.52 - 1739.84] for that
[1738.32 - 1741.68] one thing you get connected to you want
[1739.84 - 1742.00] to get connected to is angels you want
[1741.68 - 1745.52] to
[1742.00 - 1746.24] always focus about angels and focused on
[1745.52 - 1748.56] angels
[1746.24 - 1749.44] you believe in god yeah i believe in god
[1748.56 - 1752.56] absolutely but
[1749.44 - 1754.16] hey high five for god but but but at the
[1752.56 - 1755.68] same time if someone believes in the
[1754.16 - 1756.96] universe and that's what they believe in
[1755.68 - 1759.12] and they don't believe in god but it's
[1756.96 - 1760.80] the universe i'm i'm i stand behind them
[1759.12 - 1762.40] yeah if they believe in the light
[1760.80 - 1764.16] and there's some kind of light if they
[1762.40 - 1766.00] believe in the creator if they believe
[1764.16 - 1767.84] in nothing that we're on this big rock
[1766.00 - 1769.44] and it's just a ball it's just a ball of
[1767.84 - 1770.88] gravel and it's floating through space
[1769.44 - 1771.76] and then you live and you die and that's
[1770.88 - 1774.08] what they believe in
[1771.76 - 1774.88] look i'm okay with that i mean i believe
[1774.08 - 1777.12] in god
[1774.88 - 1778.40] but but everybody yeah you just you got
[1777.12 - 1779.92] your choice of what you want to believe
[1778.40 - 1780.80] in you got your choice on what you yeah
[1779.92 - 1783.60] exactly
[1780.80 - 1784.40] have you asked spirit about religion
[1783.60 - 1786.88] like if
[1784.40 - 1788.00] oh my god something is it's been my past
[1786.88 - 1790.40] time my past
[1788.00 - 1791.92] my pastime is asking spirit every
[1790.40 - 1792.80] question of the sun that isn't health
[1791.92 - 1795.20] related
[1792.80 - 1796.96] i mean when i'm when i'm on my time so

[1816.16 - 1820.48] planets yeah i want to talk about
[1817.76 - 1822.64] you know like whatever it is you know
[1820.48 - 1824.80] before the phone rings
[1822.64 - 1826.40] yeah and or a text message comes through
[1824.80 - 1828.24] or something there's some emergency
[1826.40 - 1829.84] crisis over the years that if you know
[1828.24 - 1831.92] people need people in need
[1829.84 - 1833.60] people in need but yeah wow what do you
[1831.92 - 1834.80] think about life on other planets
[1833.60 - 1837.20] what do i think about it yeah what do
[1834.80 - 1839.12] you think you think it's it
[1837.20 - 1840.64] has to be true right there has to be
[1839.12 - 1842.32] there has to be life on other planets
[1840.64 - 1843.76] it is true come on cause some
[1842.32 - 1846.08] controversy come on
[1843.76 - 1847.52] it is true tell us what you know let's
[1846.08 - 1849.44] get nasa up in here
[1847.52 - 1851.52] no it is true without a doubt of course
[1849.44 - 1854.08] there is wow yeah yeah
[1851.52 - 1855.52] as we know it or as something else i
[1854.08 - 1857.60] mean i mean seriously
[1855.52 - 1858.72] yeah the bottom line is oh well no
[1857.60 - 1861.52] there's there's yeah
[1858.72 - 1864.32] there's there's life on other planets
[1861.52 - 1866.00] and it's as we know it too yeah
[1864.32 - 1867.52] is the spirit of compassion i mean do
[1866.00 - 1870.72] you believe that one thousand percent
[1867.52 - 1870.72] they can't handle the truth
[1871.04 - 1875.68] i think somebody i forget who it was was
[1873.84 - 1876.24] somebody was like if i get elected as
[1875.68 - 1879.20] president
[1876.24 - 1879.84] i will tell you if they're aliens but i
[1879.20 - 1882.88] saw a
[1879.84 - 1886.80] son what about everyone rushing uh
[1882.88 - 1888.32] area 51. yeah that sounds scary
[1886.80 - 1890.32] i think i'll just watch from tv i'm
[1888.32 - 1892.64] gonna watch the live stream
[1890.32 - 1895.60] it's not a fast rush i mean it's a lot
[1892.64 - 1897.68] of miles before you get to it
[1895.60 - 1899.52] yeah a lot of bottom line too yeah the
[1897.68 - 1901.36] first fence is just the first fence and
[1899.52 - 1903.04] you got what 300 miles so yeah
[1901.36 - 1905.20] it's just yeah it's not a quick rush
[1903.04 - 1907.92] what are your views on uh
[1905.20 - 1908.88] marijuana ooh look that was actually
[1907.92 - 1912.24] just my next question
[1908.88 - 1913.76] no way yes sorry survived in my fields
[1912.24 - 1915.68] you know the bottom line is with that
[1913.76 - 1917.04] it's like it i always that's one of
[1915.68 - 1918.96] those soul decisions
[1917.04 - 1921.36] yeah okay because there's there's a few
[1918.96 - 1923.60] things that are so soul decisions
[1921.36 - 1925.68] it's in the person's soul and i don't
[1923.60 - 1929.12] have a place to say
[1925.68 - 1931.76] yay or nay or or where i stand on it
[1929.12 - 1933.36] yeah because it's it's different than
[1931.76 - 1935.44] what's the cause of
[1933.36 - 1936.80] rheumatoid arthritis what's the cause of
[1935.44 - 1939.60] um
[1936.80 - 1940.32] multiple sclerosis i have a stand that's
[1939.60 - 1943.68] my place
[1940.32 - 1945.52] yeah what's the cause of lupus i have a
[1943.68 - 1949.04] stand i have a place in that
[1945.52 - 1950.96] spirit allows me to have that marijuana
[1949.04 - 1952.72] totally up it's a sole decision of
[1950.96 - 1955.36] somebody whether
[1952.72 - 1955.92] they think they need it don't need it
[1955.36 - 1958.08] use it
[1955.92 - 1960.08] don't use it it's one of those it's kind
[1958.08 - 1961.68] of like abortion it's a sole decision i
[1960.08 - 1963.60] have no place
[1961.68 - 1965.04] to say you you shouldn't get an abortion
[1963.60 - 1965.60] or you should get one i mean there's
[1965.04 - 1967.84] that's
[1965.60 - 1970.08] that's this is one of those this is one
[1967.84 - 1972.56] of those epic soul decision places
[1970.08 - 1973.20] like vaccinations it's like what you
[1972.56 - 1974.96] know
[1973.20 - 1976.88] some people think it'll save the world
[1974.96 - 1978.08] some people think it it kills the world
[1976.88 - 1978.64] some people think you know what i mean
[1978.08 - 1980.24] it's like
[1978.64 - 1982.40] it's like marijuana is one of those it's
[1980.24 - 1984.96] like the sole decision that i have no
[1982.40 - 1987.20] place to decide or actually give you
[1984.96 - 1988.32] even my opinion on it because that's
[1987.20 - 1990.00] something that's like
[1988.32 - 1991.44] that's that that's something that's
[1990.00 - 1993.44] deeper within
[1991.44 - 1995.44] that you just can't you can't touch and
[1993.44 - 1996.96] you can't play with it
[1995.44 - 1999.12] yeah yeah would that be the same for
[1996.96 - 1999.52] alcohol or is that something completely
[1999.12 - 2001.44] different
[1999.52 - 2005.20] that's actually different yeah oh there
[2001.44 - 2007.92] we go
[2005.20 - 2009.04] i'm a marijuana smoker so and cbd and
[2007.92 - 2010.40] all those type of product
[2009.04 - 2012.08] products and i feel like yeah yeah i'm
[2010.40 - 2013.44] just actually the newer generation now
[2012.08 - 2014.80] especially someone like myself
[2013.44 - 2015.92] you know i don't really take medication
[2014.80 - 2017.36] i don't really do any of that type of
[2015.92 - 2018.00] stuff yeah and you know i'm about to
[2017.36 - 2021.04] have a
[2018.00 - 2022.16] a daughter in october so congratulations
[2021.04 - 2025.92] thank you so much
[2022.16 - 2027.44] i'm the fairy god so vaccinations
[2025.92 - 2028.72] what do we feel about those that's the
[2027.44 - 2029.76] same thing same thing it's like the
[2028.72 - 2032.00] marijuana yeah
[2029.76 - 2033.04] okay it's because what happens is
[2032.00 - 2035.92] there's people that
[2033.04 - 2038.08] they think there's they they believe
[2035.92 - 2040.96] that without it the world will end
[2038.08 - 2041.84] yeah and and that's that's in the soul
[2040.96 - 2043.44] of the person
[2041.84 - 2045.20] yeah and then there's people that
[2043.44 - 2046.96] believe no you stay away from it
[2045.20 - 2048.24] it's the worst thing you could ever do
[2046.96 - 2050.16] yeah and and
[2048.24 - 2052.72] and it's not just the decision that
[2050.16 - 2054.32] occurs it's more than that
[2052.72 - 2056.40] it's like something that you can't
[2054.32 - 2058.08] penetrate it's it's it's part of
[2056.40 - 2060.64] who they are in a soul that decides that
[2058.08 - 2063.20] you see what i mean so it's
[2060.64 - 2065.28] yeah it's it's like that so i have no
[2063.20 - 2068.00] pla i have no place there meaning
[2065.28 - 2068.96] i i mean do you get vaccinations do i
[2068.00 - 2072.00] yeah i mean
[2068.96 - 2073.68] i mean he has no he had no choice well
[2072.00 - 2076.56] like you can do follow-ups
[2073.68 - 2077.36] i still get my flu shot you get a flu
[2076.56 - 2079.28] shot
[2077.36 - 2081.52] yeah because you know my dad who freak
[2079.28 - 2082.72] out on me okay my dad's all like you
[2081.52 - 2085.12] need a flu shot
[2082.72 - 2086.72] all the time you know my dad he's like
[2085.12 - 2087.92] terrified of getting sick well i haven't
[2086.72 - 2089.20] thought about it i mean i haven't
[2087.92 - 2090.88] thought about it haven't i
[2089.20 - 2092.96] i've had no need for i haven't gotten
[2090.88 - 2095.36] any so i i haven't thought about it
[2092.96 - 2096.08] i mean but but if you if you're thinking
[2095.36 - 2097.44] about it
[2096.08 - 2098.96] yeah and you're really worried or
[2097.44 - 2101.04] something that's when it clicks in that
[2098.96 - 2103.12] soul decision clicks in you know where
[2101.04 - 2104.72] where you you know you can you can
[2103.12 - 2106.96] research both sides
[2104.72 - 2108.32] you can then decide whatever lands in
[2106.96 - 2110.00] that area you know
[2108.32 - 2111.36] that kind of thing like i've never had
[2110.00 - 2112.88] to worry about any health stuff because
[2111.36 - 2114.64] it's spirit compassion so
[2112.88 - 2117.28] i'm a different i'm the wrong person to
[2114.64 - 2120.48] ask that question
[2117.28 - 2121.28] do you partake in a little herb i i
[2120.48 - 2124.24] don't
[2121.28 - 2125.28] but i've i've got a nice glass of red i
[2124.24 - 2128.80] i no i don't
[2125.28 - 2130.96] oh wow neither neither no i love that
[2128.80 - 2132.72] okay i know but but but that has nothing
[2130.96 - 2134.48] to do with someone else you know no no
[2132.72 - 2135.60] i'm intrigued there's there's people
[2134.48 - 2137.44] there's people that if they don't have
[2135.60 - 2138.80] that glass of red wine i mean they
[2137.44 - 2140.80] they might have a stroke because of the
[2138.80 - 2142.24] amount of stress they're under yeah that
[2140.80 - 2144.40] glass of red wine
[2142.24 - 2146.80] is the saving grace on the weekend yeah
[2144.40 - 2149.44] you know has probably saved a few lives
[2146.80 - 2151.84] yeah sure used the wrong way and it's
[2149.44 - 2153.84] probably ended a few lives yeah
[2151.84 - 2155.52] bottom line but the bottom line is so
[2153.84 - 2156.48] you know it but i've never yeah i've
[2155.52 - 2158.88] never had
[2156.48 - 2160.48] had any use for that that's awesome
[2158.88 - 2161.28] you're the coolest person i think i've
[2160.48 - 2164.40] ever met
[2161.28 - 2167.04] like you and lou come on
[2164.40 - 2168.64] you're so cool can i can i ask you is
[2167.04 - 2170.88] there anything you're reading right now
[2168.64 - 2172.40] or is that an improper question any good
[2170.88 - 2175.60] books in my reading i'm kidding
[2172.40 - 2176.88] yeah exactly exactly and i mean look
[2175.60 - 2179.04] information has come through with that
[2176.88 - 2181.60] yeah i mean for everybody here
[2179.04 - 2183.04] okay so do you want a reading noah yeah
[2181.60 - 2186.32] i'm scared
[2183.04 - 2188.40] well well well actually remember
[2186.32 - 2189.60] he's a hyper kind you can do me then no
[2188.40 - 2192.48] don't do that
[2189.60 - 2193.28] you told me you're a hyper contractor no
[2192.48 - 2195.76] no
[2193.28 - 2197.20] let's not do noah i'm down are you sure
[2195.76 - 2199.36] oh yeah i volunteer
[2197.20 - 2200.32] are you sure yeah i'd love to if you do
[2199.36 - 2202.64] it i'll do it
[2200.32 - 2204.00] fine you sure yeah sure wait is it that
[2202.64 - 2206.08] bad
[2204.00 - 2207.76] no no we do a little fun thing but
[2206.08 - 2209.60] usually what i don't do i don't do
[2207.76 - 2212.48] here's this is this is fun this is good
[2209.60 - 2214.64] yeah but i don't do big serious readings
[2212.48 - 2216.24] meaning the reason why is because
[2214.64 - 2217.12] there's millions of people waiting that
[2216.24 - 2219.36] are really sick
[2217.12 - 2220.72] absolutely yeah and so i you know so but
[2219.36 - 2222.08] but this is fun this is just a little
[2220.72 - 2224.48] stuff your adrenals
[2222.08 - 2226.24] okay you have to get those better they
[2224.48 - 2226.96] are they are weakened my what your
[2226.24 - 2229.04] adrenals
[2226.96 - 2231.44] okay okay that's one thing your adrenal
[2229.04 - 2233.60] glands they sit on top of your kidneys
[2231.44 - 2235.60] so you have to do some things for that
[2233.60 - 2237.20] that the celery juice is important for
[2235.60 - 2238.56] that all on its own so you should be
[2237.20 - 2240.00] doing that that's going to improve your
[2238.56 - 2242.48] adrenals automatically
[2240.00 - 2243.20] okay but that's one focus we have to
[2242.48 - 2247.12] kind of catch
[2243.20 - 2247.68] now so that a few years down the road
[2247.12 - 2249.52] they're not
[2247.68 - 2251.52] like giving out a little bit on you and
[2249.52 - 2254.96] then you're then you're really dragging
[2251.52 - 2256.56] okay so so that's one thing what effects
[2254.96 - 2258.08] i can't even pronounce the word what am
[2256.56 - 2261.04] i doing wrong what what
[2258.08 - 2261.60] is it is it diet is it what what well
[2261.04 - 2263.60] you know
[2261.60 - 2264.96] you know i mean here's the thing like
[2263.60 - 2267.60] there's times where you don't eat
[2264.96 - 2269.12] yeah and there's times where you do it
[2267.60 - 2272.00] it's inconsistent with you
[2269.12 - 2273.68] oh my god yeah it really is yeah it is
[2272.00 - 2275.92] well spirit knows so that's
[2273.68 - 2277.44] weird knows why yeah well that's part of
[2275.92 - 2279.20] it because what's happening is when you
[2277.44 - 2280.16] get inconsistent your adrenals are
[2279.20 - 2282.00] flooding a lot
[2280.16 - 2283.20] you run on adrenaline a lot more than
[2282.00 - 2285.44] you should be
[2283.20 - 2287.52] and that's what's happening you're over
[2285.44 - 2289.92] using your adrenaline storage
[2287.52 - 2290.64] because you're not eating consistently
[2289.92 - 2292.48] wow
[2290.64 - 2293.84] at consistent times so you're burning
[2292.48 - 2297.36] out your adrenals
[2293.84 - 2298.64] thank you spirit so that's the studio
[2297.36 - 2300.80] the other thing is you got a little bit
[2298.64 - 2303.52] of mercury
[2300.80 - 2304.80] and in here oh i eat a lot of sushi well
[2303.52 - 2305.36] you got a little bit of mercury in your
[2304.80 - 2307.04] brain
[2305.36 - 2308.72] i'm mercury poisoning you got some more
[2307.04 - 2310.56] it's not really like a poisoning
[2308.72 - 2313.28] poisoning or anything it's not like that
[2310.56 - 2314.24] you just got a lot of traces and they're
[2313.28 - 2316.32] building up
[2314.24 - 2317.76] some is in your brain some is in the
[2316.32 - 2319.28] liver so we
[2317.76 - 2320.48] we should get the heavy metals out we
[2319.28 - 2322.56] should get the mercury out because
[2320.48 - 2326.00] that's going to start causing
[2322.56 - 2327.76] brain fog it's going to start causing
[2326.00 - 2329.52] little short circuits you're going to
[2327.76 - 2331.04] start getting more anxiety
[2329.52 - 2332.48] we got to kind of nip that in the butt
[2331.04 - 2334.08] between the adrenals and the mercury
[2332.48 - 2337.44] that's the two things with you
[2334.08 - 2338.56] that's it that's it for today the fun
[2337.44 - 2340.96] stuff yeah
[2338.56 - 2340.96] so there
[2342.80 - 2348.08] so celery juice
[2346.24 - 2349.36] to help the kidneys yeah and that would
[2348.08 - 2351.12] help the it'll help the adrenals
[2349.36 - 2353.60] and then what's with what do i do to
[2351.12 - 2354.80] help the mercury issues eating guys
[2353.60 - 2357.20] i'm treating sushi gotta get on
[2354.80 - 2359.44] spirulina oh yes
[2357.20 - 2360.32] we have that right right you gotta get
[2359.44 - 2362.16] on spirulina
[2360.32 - 2364.32] you gotta get on barley grass juice
[2362.16 - 2366.80] powder yeah you gotta get on that
[2364.32 - 2368.64] cilantro you gotta get those in there
[2366.80 - 2369.84] wild blueberries you could do the frozen
[2368.64 - 2372.40] wild blueberries
[2369.84 - 2375.52] is sushi bad for you yes so i should
[2372.40 - 2375.52] stop eating sushi yes
[2375.76 - 2383.84] oh my god okay your turn
[2379.28 - 2387.12] that was easy your turn
[2383.84 - 2389.44] oh man hopeless case today so no no no
[2387.12 - 2390.48] just kidding yeah exactly no you look
[2389.44 - 2391.76] good your liver
[2390.48 - 2394.00] getting stagnant and sluggish it's
[2391.76 - 2395.44] running hot yeah to get a hot liver
[2394.00 - 2397.60] so that's one thing going on that we
[2395.44 - 2398.32] have to be concerned about yep pancreas
[2397.60 - 2400.08] for you
[2398.32 - 2401.76] okay so it's another thing too so down
[2400.08 - 2402.08] the road i'm worried about diabetes for
[2401.76 - 2404.00] you
[2402.08 - 2405.52] okay even though you eat pretty healthy
[2404.00 - 2406.16] yeah but i'm worried about a little bit
[2405.52 - 2408.88] of a
[2406.16 - 2410.96] a1c rising type a type 2 diabetic
[2408.88 - 2412.40] because like hypoglycemia you had years
[2410.96 - 2413.28] ago so you had a little blood sugar
[2412.40 - 2415.12] inconsistency
[2413.28 - 2416.56] i did yeah yeah so absolutely did
[2415.12 - 2418.96] somebody tell you you had that
[2416.56 - 2420.96] yeah yeah someone what is it the my red
[2418.96 - 2422.56] blood cells are thicker than
[2420.96 - 2424.96] they should be or something like that so
[2422.56 - 2427.04] you lin or whatever that's called
[2424.96 - 2428.56] so you've you've been in that zone yeah
[2427.04 - 2430.32] so that's one thing so i got to kind of
[2428.56 - 2431.76] watch that so when i'm doing a read and
[2430.32 - 2433.12] taking a look and then i'm actually
[2431.76 - 2435.04] going partially blind right now good
[2433.12 - 2437.20] thing i wore the shades today
[2435.04 - 2438.24] okay because when i do the readings this
[2437.20 - 2439.92] white light comes
[2438.24 - 2441.68] and then i get snow blindness and now
[2439.92 - 2443.12] i'm going to be you know tripping all
[2441.68 - 2444.96] over the place for a little bit
[2443.12 - 2446.32] in a little while but the bottom line is
[2444.96 - 2448.48] i'm looking through your body
[2446.32 - 2449.68] i don't see any diseases so to speak or
[2448.48 - 2451.28] anything scary
[2449.68 - 2453.04] i mean i don't see any anything that's
[2451.28 - 2454.24] that's that's you know someone would be
[2453.04 - 2457.44] afraid of yeah
[2454.24 - 2457.76] but um future diabetes diabetes as far
[2457.44 - 2460.00] as
[2457.76 - 2461.52] pre-diabetes okay probably in about
[2460.00 - 2462.80] seven eight years you'll probably get a
[2461.52 - 2466.00] a1c going up
[2462.80 - 2466.80] uh pre-pre-diabetes diagnosis and
[2466.00 - 2468.32] and that's where you're going to be
[2466.80 - 2469.36] sitting and you've got blood sugar and
[2468.32 - 2472.24] inconsistencies absolutely
[2469.36 - 2473.84] pancreas is is with you it's always been
[2472.24 - 2476.40] a little weakened on and off you had
[2473.84 - 2478.72] food poisoning years ago spirit said and
[2476.40 - 2480.56] i'm trying to remember as far as spirit
[2478.72 - 2482.80] told me about two minutes ago so i'm
[2480.56 - 2485.20] asking against he had food poisoning
[2482.80 - 2487.28] i think it was probably within the last
[2485.20 - 2490.08] three to five years it was in his pocket
[2487.28 - 2490.72] that weakened your pancreas so that's
[2490.08 - 2492.24] that's why
[2490.72 - 2494.08] i got to look out for you and noah
[2492.24 - 2494.64] you're looking good don't worry i'm not
[2494.08 - 2496.80] worried i'm
[2494.64 - 2498.48] not worried about you why i'm good
[2496.80 - 2500.00] you're making your doctor's appointment
[2498.48 - 2502.40] for seven and eight years
[2500.00 - 2503.92] i know what i have to do though like i'm
[2502.40 - 2507.44] pretty healthy eater anyway
[2503.92 - 2508.00] but i mean my diet can be inconsistent
[2507.44 - 2509.76] so i'll eat

[2577.52 - 2580.56] any of these kind of kind of spirit
[2579.12 - 2583.36] guide books is
[2580.56 - 2584.72] are they part of the same teachings of
[2583.36 - 2586.88] the spirit world
[2584.72 - 2587.76] no this is different yeah this is
[2586.88 - 2590.24] different okay
[2587.76 - 2591.12] um and uh and i have tremendous respect
[2590.24 - 2593.28] for that yeah
[2591.12 - 2594.56] uh for sure i mean uh you know the

[2595.92 - 2599.12] it's just it's been so helpful yeah it's
[2597.92 - 2601.12] just been incredible
[2599.12 - 2602.48] incredible help for people in so many
[2601.12 - 2603.36] ways you know life-changing
[2602.48 - 2605.44] life-changing
[2603.36 - 2606.64] is entirely different this is this is
[2605.44 - 2608.96] literally just
[2606.64 - 2611.20] advanced medical information not
[2608.96 - 2613.60] discovered by research and science yet
[2611.20 - 2615.20] to save countless lives on the planet
[2613.60 - 2617.04] and that's what's coming from wow it's
[2615.20 - 2618.32] an entirely different thing yeah and i'm
[2617.04 - 2620.56] just a messenger
[2618.32 - 2621.36] i'm just the guy that's got to voice it
[2620.56 - 2623.92] out
[2621.36 - 2626.08] you know i love that well um you're
[2623.92 - 2626.48] genuinely the coolest person i've ever
[2626.08 - 2629.28] met
[2626.48 - 2630.32] i wish no like genuinely like this has
[2629.28 - 2632.88] been the coolest
[2630.32 - 2634.00] mm-hmm welcome to my face i don't even
[2632.88 - 2636.08] know what could top this
[2634.00 - 2637.68] this is so cool i love it like i'm blown
[2636.08 - 2640.00] away uh i recently did
[2637.68 - 2641.20] you posted something on eggs yeah oh
[2640.00 - 2643.92] yeah no and i got the
[2641.20 - 2645.20] crap kicked out of me on that one you
[2643.92 - 2646.48] know there's so many people that that
[2645.20 - 2648.08] love their eggs we have an emotional
[2646.48 - 2649.52] connection to them i mean we everybody
[2648.08 - 2651.28] has emotional connection to them
[2649.52 - 2652.72] it's like milk eggs and bread yeah it's
[2651.28 - 2654.08] like these three things that you buy
[2652.72 - 2656.08] consistently when you go to the store
[2654.08 - 2656.72] and i wasn't trashing eggs i was just
[2656.08 - 2659.28] saying
[2656.72 - 2660.80] that look if if you feel good just eat
[2659.28 - 2663.28] them what it is is that
[2660.80 - 2665.04] here's what happened years ago years ago
[2663.28 - 2668.32] decades and decades ago okay
[2665.04 - 2669.36] there were viruses and bacteria raised
[2668.32 - 2671.76] in labs
[2669.36 - 2673.12] yep and in those labs they had to feed
[2671.76 - 2675.92] the viruses and bacteria
[2673.12 - 2676.32] yep okay and they did and eggs was the
[2675.92 - 2678.88] food
[2676.32 - 2680.00] they fed them yeah the chronic illness
[2678.88 - 2682.72] of today is from
[2680.00 - 2683.84] pathogens it's from pathogens yeah
[2682.72 - 2685.20] that's what it's from
[2683.84 - 2686.64] you get the lyme disease you've got the
[2685.20 - 2688.00] multiple sclerosis you've got the you
[2686.64 - 2689.36] know rheumatoid arthritis hashimoto's
[2688.00 - 2690.80] thyroiditis you've got the lupus
[2689.36 - 2692.88] the chronic fatigue syndrome
[2690.80 - 2694.64] fibromyalgia that's all i try to do as
[2692.88 - 2695.60] fast as i can you know i could ramble
[2694.64 - 2698.72] off others
[2695.60 - 2700.88] but those are from viruses
[2698.72 - 2702.16] and so we walk around with these bugs in
[2700.88 - 2703.92] us like epstein-barr
[2702.16 - 2705.76] the epstein-barr virus and one that's
[2703.92 - 2706.72] just that's one of 60 varieties of
[2705.76 - 2709.04] epstein-barr
[2706.72 - 2710.32] we walk around with that virus in us and
[2709.04 - 2712.96] it creates fatigue
[2710.32 - 2715.36] it creates problems and then we feed it
[2712.96 - 2715.84] we feed it eggs it's not that i hate
[2715.36 - 2718.56] eggs
[2715.84 - 2720.00] they're delicious everybody loves them
[2718.56 - 2722.00] we have connections to them
[2720.00 - 2723.60] our parents make us eggs their mom makes
[2722.00 - 2725.52] us eggs right who made you eggs
[2723.60 - 2727.12] who who made did anybody make you eggs
[2725.52 - 2728.56] um yeah
[2727.12 - 2730.40] i mean me and the wife make eggs pretty
[2728.56 - 2732.72] much on the weekends exactly right and
[2730.40 - 2733.60] there's there's a feeling with that yeah
[2732.72 - 2734.96] right i mean
[2733.60 - 2736.64] what about you know it you don't like
[2734.96 - 2741.04] them you know what it's
[2736.64 - 2742.96] weird actually i like them kind of
[2741.04 - 2745.20] but there's something about them that
[2742.96 - 2746.08] kind of grosses me out at the same time
[2745.20 - 2748.08] so like i'm very
[2746.08 - 2749.52] indifferent it actually genuinely
[2748.08 - 2753.04] depends on the day
[2749.52 - 2753.52] like since it's 100 degrees outside
[2753.04 - 2755.36] today
[2753.52 - 2757.44] yeah there's no way you'd catch me
[2755.36 - 2759.20] eating eggs in 100 degree weather
[2757.44 - 2760.64] i don't know what it is but it has to do
[2759.20 - 2762.24] with the weather i swear to you and
[2760.64 - 2764.00] everyone makes fun of me
[2762.24 - 2765.12] like my my best friend makes farming for
[2764.00 - 2766.48] it all the time he'll like let's go get
[2765.12 - 2768.32] breakfast and i'm like okay
[2766.48 - 2769.92] but i can't eat eggs it's hot outside
[2768.32 - 2772.88] and whenever it's hot outside
[2769.92 - 2775.20] eggs extremely gross me out yeah but if
[2772.88 - 2777.12] it's not hot and like i'm not
[2775.20 - 2778.48] i don't know it's something i don't know
[2777.12 - 2780.48] what it is but like
[2778.48 - 2781.76] it just depends on the day with me and
[2780.48 - 2783.52] eggs because like
[2781.76 - 2785.68] i think i'm the same though i think that
[2783.52 - 2787.60] makes sense it kind of grossed me out
[2785.68 - 2789.52] my grandma used to have an obsession
[2787.60 - 2791.68] with egg whites
[2789.52 - 2793.28] but then she'd like burn them kind of
[2791.68 - 2794.80] and they'd smell really bad and make the
[2793.28 - 2795.92] kitchen smell bad for a while and i
[2794.80 - 2797.76] think that really like
[2795.92 - 2799.28] changed my mind on eggs for a second
[2797.76 - 2799.68] yeah that's fine i'm indifferent about
[2799.28 - 2801.52] them
[2799.68 - 2804.40] yeah well you know well you're you're
[2801.52 - 2806.24] rare because so many people love them
[2804.40 - 2808.48] and then what happened was those viruses
[2806.24 - 2810.48] somehow escaped the labs
[2808.48 - 2812.64] they got into people over the last 70 80
[2810.48 - 2813.36] years we have chronic illness because of
[2812.64 - 2816.48] it
[2813.36 - 2817.92] you know and and eggs are feeding it
[2816.48 - 2819.68] so it's not that i'm against them or
[2817.92 - 2821.28] anything i'm just saying look if if you
[2819.68 - 2823.12] want a fighting chance
[2821.28 - 2825.52] if you've got anything wrong with you
[2823.12 - 2828.96] eczema anything psoriasis anything
[2825.52 - 2832.48] like in sclerosis if you have rosacea
[2828.96 - 2834.00] if you anything and eczema yeah well
[2832.48 - 2836.08] that's that's actually toxic heavy
[2834.00 - 2837.84] metals involved in that and then
[2836.08 - 2839.52] with all of that you want to get rid of
[2837.84 - 2841.76] the eggs you just do there's there's a
[2839.52 - 2843.52] reason for this so the bottom line is
[2841.76 - 2845.52] i took a lot of flak from that going
[2843.52 - 2847.84] against eggs just actually just you know
[2845.52 - 2849.12] there's torches picks pitchforks you
[2847.84 - 2851.68] know i can imagine everything
[2849.12 - 2852.80] what about the um what's your vibe on
[2851.68 - 2854.72] dairy then
[2852.80 - 2856.16] i mean dairy does something similar it
[2854.72 - 2858.48] does feed bugs it does
[2856.16 - 2860.24] but it's not the number one bug feeding
[2858.48 - 2861.28] food if someone's worried about fungus
[2860.24 - 2862.40] if they're worried about yeast if
[2861.28 - 2863.76] they're worried about mold if they're
[2862.40 - 2865.52] worried about bacteria if they're
[2863.76 - 2865.92] worried about bad bacteria whatever it
[2865.52 - 2867.28] is
[2865.92 - 2868.72] don't eat an egg you're just going to
[2867.28 - 2869.76] feed it yeah that's all i was just
[2868.72 - 2872.40] delivering the message
[2869.76 - 2874.40] kindly nicely it's kind of like the have
[2872.40 - 2876.48] you read the the china study
[2874.40 - 2877.92] i haven't read it but but i i hear
[2876.48 - 2879.84] there's good information yeah
[2877.92 - 2881.52] yeah and he's he basically says the same
[2879.84 - 2884.64] thing he feeds like rats
[2881.52 - 2887.12] and mice eggs and dairy and
[2884.64 - 2888.32] feeds the other set of mice and rats on
[2887.12 - 2890.00] plant-based foods
[2888.32 - 2891.44] yeah and the ones who got fed the dairy
[2890.00 - 2892.96] in eggs developed
[2891.44 - 2894.40] more severe cancers and diets
[2892.96 - 2895.76] prematurely than the ones who were i
[2894.40 - 2897.20] think that's a plant i think that's a
[2895.76 - 2899.44] plant-based book right yeah
[2897.20 - 2901.04] see what happens is i'm neither nor
[2899.44 - 2902.80] either more i'm not in the food world oh
[2901.04 - 2904.72] it's actually no it's just a study
[2902.80 - 2906.08] but there was a book after that from the
[2904.72 - 2907.44] writer of the china study that had a
[2906.08 - 2909.36] plant-based
[2907.44 - 2911.12] i gotcha i got you know it's so funny
[2909.36 - 2913.20] because i stay out of the food war you
[2911.12 - 2915.04] got the vegans angry at the paleo people
[2913.20 - 2916.96] you got the paleo anger the vegans
[2915.04 - 2918.32] if you're a vegan i feel so bad for
[2916.96 - 2920.24] vegans and plant-based people because
[2918.32 - 2922.24] all you have to do is sneeze
[2920.24 - 2924.48] and it's blamed on your diet yeah if
[2922.24 - 2925.12] you're paleo if your keto animal protein
[2924.48 - 2926.72] whatever
[2925.12 - 2927.76] you can sneeze you can have an injury i
[2926.72 - 2928.64] mean you could have anything you could
[2927.76 - 2930.00] have bad health
[2928.64 - 2932.72] you could have a problem you could be
[2930.00 - 2934.32] sick no one blames your diet but if
[2932.72 - 2935.84] you're plant-based it's your diet you
[2934.32 - 2936.24] know what i mean so all these vegans are
[2935.84 - 2937.92] like
[2936.24 - 2939.36] they're falling from grace you know and
[2937.92 - 2939.92] i feel bad for them because they get a
[2939.36 - 2941.76] sniffle
[2939.92 - 2943.28] and then they run back to animal protein
[2941.76 - 2944.48] but the funny thing is animal protein
[2943.28 - 2945.20] people are flipping too everybody's
[2944.48 - 2946.88] flip-flopping
[2945.20 - 2949.12] they're all going here some people vegan
[2946.88 - 2950.64] some back here and what happens is
[2949.12 - 2952.72] they're confused though they don't know
[2950.64 - 2953.52] what causes illness they're playing with
[2952.72 - 2955.12] food
[2953.52 - 2957.04] they're playing guessing games with food
[2955.12 - 2958.40] mostly i'm not trying to insult anybody
[2957.04 - 2958.96] i'm just just trying to let everybody
[2958.40 - 2960.88] know
[2958.96 - 2962.48] i don't have a belief system i don't
[2960.88 - 2963.92] have a belief system that plant-based is
[2962.48 - 2964.96] going to save the world and i don't have
[2963.92 - 2967.04] a belief system that
[2964.96 - 2968.08] animal protein is the best way to eat
[2967.04 - 2970.88] whatever it is
[2968.08 - 2972.16] i don't have that but what i do have is
[2970.88 - 2972.72] i will give you the cause of your
[2972.16 - 2974.72] illness
[2972.72 - 2976.80] and tell you what foods actually fix it
[2974.72 - 2978.80] you choose what diet you want to sit on
[2976.80 - 2980.16] that's fine and that's what a that's a
[2978.80 - 2981.60] spirit of compassion there's no belief
[2980.16 - 2982.40] systems here it's about providing
[2981.60 - 2984.40] information
[2982.40 - 2985.92] so everybody's not confused yeah because
[2984.40 - 2986.56] it's a ball of confusion you know what
[2985.92 - 2988.72] the thing is
[2986.56 - 2990.48] all the keto people all the paleo people
[2988.72 - 2991.60] all the vegans they're all still sick

[3031.52 - 3036.88] everybody has bad bacteria in their gut
[3034.24 - 3037.52] so that's just feeding any bad bacteria
[3036.88 - 3039.68] in your gut

[3039.68 - 3043.20] has it yeah they have bad bacteria it's
[3041.36 - 3046.56] just that when you drink your milk
[3043.20 - 3048.00] you're feeding that bad bacteria
[3046.56 - 3049.76] yeah they came up with this whole thing
[3048.00 - 3050.64] of lactose intolerance that's not what
[3049.76 - 3053.04] it is it's you're
[3050.64 - 3054.08] feeding the bugs and then the bugs are
[3053.04 - 3056.08] creating inflammation
[3054.08 - 3057.92] and then you get your ibs yeah don't

[3088.72 - 3092.88] what are your thoughts on cbd cbd it's
[3091.36 - 3094.56] the same thing with the marijuana
[3092.88 - 3096.24] it's it's really a true or dumb it's
[3094.56 - 3097.28] it's it's a choice it's it's it's in the
[3096.24 - 3100.40] soul
[3097.28 - 3102.96] but do you think cbd does help
[3100.40 - 3103.92] anxiety i know better things that help
[3102.96 - 3105.60] anxiety
[3103.92 - 3107.36] i'm not against cbd i'm not for it i'm
[3105.60 - 3108.32] not against it i know better things that
[3107.36 - 3110.80] help anxiety
[3108.32 - 3112.56] yeah because i've seen thousands and
[3110.80 - 3113.76] thousands of people heal their anxiety
[3112.56 - 3115.60] with the information from spirit of
[3113.76 - 3117.04] compassion so i know better things yeah
[3115.60 - 3118.72] but but you know and that's the thing
[3117.04 - 3120.00] but am i against it for it
[3118.72 - 3121.84] either way it's whatever the person
[3120.00 - 3122.96] wants to do because once again that's
[3121.84 - 3126.64] something that's
[3122.96 - 3129.76] it it's it's it's like diamond plated
[3126.64 - 3130.40] inside your soul yeah have you met other
[3129.76 - 3133.76] people
[3130.40 - 3136.88] around the world that talk to
[3133.76 - 3139.84] the spirit or your same spirit or not
[3136.88 - 3142.88] same spirit or are there other people
[3139.84 - 3143.52] yeah that have have you come in contact
[3142.88 - 3145.12] with anybody

[3145.12 - 3149.28] there maybe they are i remember i did a
[3147.60 - 3150.80] lecture many many years ago i think was
[3149.28 - 3152.56] like i don't know 15 years ago maybe a
[3150.80 - 3154.56] little longer and i did a lecture
[3152.56 - 3156.40] and someone was out in the audience says
[3154.56 - 3156.96] i hear the i hear spirit too the same
[3156.40 - 3159.52] voice
[3156.96 - 3160.00] i was so happy i was like get up here
[3159.52 - 3162.00] yeah
[3160.00 - 3163.60] get up here because this is it's like a
[3162.00 - 3164.08] bumble bee finding another oh something
[3163.60 - 3166.00] like
[3164.08 - 3167.44] a like a bird finding another bird it's
[3166.00 - 3170.08] like yeah i get up here
[3167.44 - 3170.80] my god and they get up there and they're
[3170.08 - 3173.36] like no i
[3170.80 - 3174.88] i hear this i say your spirit too and
[3173.36 - 3175.20] then spirit tells me all these i could
[3174.88 - 3177.76] do
[3175.20 - 3179.04] well let's get some people up here yeah
[3177.76 - 3180.96] let's get it working
[3179.04 - 3182.56] let me hear it and and in the end it was
[3180.96 - 3183.76] just somebody that had a spiritual
[3182.56 - 3185.52] connection and they heard a voice
[3183.76 - 3187.92] periodically inside their head
[3185.52 - 3188.64] yeah and i i have all respect for that
[3187.92 - 3190.40] and i just
[3188.64 - 3192.08] pat on the back like you know that's
[3190.40 - 3193.36] great i'm really i'm really glad for
[3192.08 - 3195.76] that but i was looking yeah
[3193.36 - 3196.40] to find somebody that hears it all the
[3195.76 - 3199.20] time
[3196.40 - 3199.92] in real time no matter what and can read
[3199.20 - 3201.68] people
[3199.92 - 3204.08] on the spot see it doesn't matter if i'm
[3201.68 - 3205.28] totally trashed i mean like exhausted
[3204.08 - 3206.80] like no sleep
[3205.28 - 3208.48] writing all night like last night i was
[3206.80 - 3210.08] writing the book all night i had like
[3208.48 - 3212.32] two hours of sleep last night so
[3210.08 - 3213.60] and i'm and i'm tired but the point is
[3212.32 - 3215.52] is that
[3213.60 - 3216.96] it doesn't matter spirit's gonna talk to
[3215.52 - 3220.00] me see how it goes
[3216.96 - 3220.40] because psychics and mediums once
[3220.00 - 3223.52] they're
[3220.40 - 3225.92] wasted and totally tapped out they can't
[3223.52 - 3227.44] they're the connection goes yeah they're
[3225.92 - 3228.96] you know when they get burnt out
[3227.44 - 3230.56] literally that's been one of the
[3228.96 - 3232.80] problems with this is
[3230.56 - 3234.48] i can be like i could be pushed to the
[3232.80 - 3236.64] limit to the point of literally
[3234.48 - 3238.40] practically dying because of it but
[3236.64 - 3239.92] spirit will still talk because it's like
[3238.40 - 3242.56] your best friend still talking to
[3239.92 - 3244.40] did you ever have a friend where is it
[3242.56 - 3244.96] she's your best friend or he's your best
[3244.40 - 3247.04] friend
[3244.96 - 3248.32] but you just can't hear it right now
[3247.04 - 3250.64] yeah did you ever have
[3248.32 - 3252.32] that where you're like no i'm tired i
[3250.64 - 3253.52] and your friend wants to talk and wants
[3252.32 - 3255.04] to talk in here well
[3253.52 - 3258.00] guess what it's me when lou wants to
[3255.04 - 3260.88] turn his phone off at 9pm
[3258.00 - 3261.60] which i do so it always happens i've
[3260.88 - 3264.08] never found
[3261.60 - 3266.00] somebody with that yet and i've never
[3264.08 - 3267.12] found someone that knows advanced
[3266.00 - 3270.00] information
[3267.12 - 3271.28] ahead of science of research that's
[3270.00 - 3273.12] they're getting it from here
[3271.28 - 3274.96] so no i i've never seen it but i'm
[3273.12 - 3276.24] hoping it happens because you know what
[3274.96 - 3278.72] i'm kind of i kind of want to
[3276.24 - 3280.08] be done and retire i want somebody else
[3278.72 - 3281.52] to take take it over
[3280.08 - 3283.28] let them take it over let them put the
[3281.52 - 3286.40] books out i'm um it's
[3283.28 - 3288.40] such a unique position has any doctors
[3286.40 - 3290.32] put a hit out on your head yet
[3288.40 - 3291.44] no you're not friends i'm friends with a
[3290.32 - 3293.36] lot of guys there's a lot of great
[3291.44 - 3294.56] doctors out there one great doctor dr
[3293.36 - 3296.16] alejandra younger
[3294.56 - 3297.92] yeah he did the forward for the first
[3296.16 - 3299.76] medical medium book he's he's a he's a
[3297.92 - 3301.60] genius he's a great doctor he's a lot of
[3299.76 - 3304.08] amazing doctors i know
[3301.60 - 3305.44] over the years i've troubleshooted for
[3304.08 - 3306.96] doctors that's how i
[3305.44 - 3308.96] that's how i've been doing this all
[3306.96 - 3309.84] these years doctors have been using me
[3308.96 - 3312.16] they actually
[3309.84 - 3314.32] look for the information because you
[3312.16 - 3316.16] know why doctors got compassion
[3314.32 - 3317.36] yeah they went into it originally
[3316.16 - 3318.16] because they don't want to see people
[3317.36 - 3320.00] suffer
[3318.16 - 3321.20] so a lot of doctors they kind of like
[3320.00 - 3322.48] break that ego thing
[3321.20 - 3324.48] and they say i want to hear what he has
[3322.48 - 3325.92] to say i want to know what he has to say
[3324.48 - 3326.56] yep so there's a lot of great doctors
[3325.92 - 3329.20] out there do
[3326.56 - 3330.48] do you um do you teach nutrition because
[3329.20 - 3332.96] i feel like whenever i go into like a
[3330.48 - 3335.76] hospital or a doctor's surgery or
[3332.96 - 3336.56] nutrition is so far removed from any of
[3335.76 - 3338.88] the
[3336.56 - 3340.80] the diagnosis of any illnesses ever i
[3338.88 - 3343.28] mean that's just my interpretation of it
[3340.80 - 3344.32] other people may be different but um i
[3343.28 - 3346.32] feel like they don't have enough
[3344.32 - 3348.40] knowledge in nutrition
[3346.32 - 3350.00] well you you can use you could see it
[3348.40 - 3351.68] like there's articles yeah there's
[3350.00 - 3353.20] there's articles on me all the time out
[3351.68 - 3354.48] there yeah they're like writing dozens
[3353.20 - 3355.20] of articles out there and it's actually
[3354.48 - 3357.28] really funny
[3355.20 - 3359.36] because they write these articles they
[3357.28 - 3360.88] never have any of the information right
[3359.36 - 3362.16] about the medical medium which is funny
[3360.88 - 3363.84] that always makes me laugh but that's
[3362.16 - 3367.04] nice
[3363.84 - 3368.56] then then a dietitian will come on which
[3367.04 - 3370.56] i know some great dietitians
[3368.56 - 3372.16] but a dietitian will come on and not
[3370.56 - 3374.32] even realize celery
[3372.16 - 3376.48] is an herb so they're sitting there
[3374.32 - 3378.56] ripping apart the celery juice movement
[3376.48 - 3380.08] saying it's placebo saying it doesn't
[3378.56 - 3381.04] work right they're saying all these
[3380.08 - 3383.92] things
[3381.04 - 3384.48] and then they're calling it a vegetable
[3383.92 - 3386.88] when it's an
[3384.48 - 3387.76] actual herb and it's just like oh my god
[3386.88 - 3389.12] you know and
[3387.76 - 3391.68] they haven't dealt with the chronic
[3389.12 - 3393.12] allele recovering from diseases using
[3391.68 - 3395.28] celery juice so they're just complete
[3393.12 - 3397.04] so yeah you know nutritionists

[3400.16 - 3404.16] everybody
