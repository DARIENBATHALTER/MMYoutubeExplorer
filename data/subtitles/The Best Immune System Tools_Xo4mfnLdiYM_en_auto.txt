[68.08 - 73.24] work with them because this doesn't
[70.64 - 75.04] exist out there that's why very
[73.24 - 76.40] important have you done the Elderberry
[75.04 - 78.12] thing and you've gone and got an
[76.40 - 80.08] Elderberry syrup out there or some kind
[78.12 - 84.40] of Elderberry thing right and you're
[80.08 - 88.88] using it they add water to those they
[84.40 - 91.52] add traces of alcohol plus water plus
[88.88 - 94.16] everything else this has raw organic
[91.52 - 97.56] honey in the Elderberry product think
[94.16 - 100.28] about that right there raw organic honey
[97.56 - 101.72] in the Elderberry product I'm holding in
[100.28 - 103.88] my hand right now it's called soothe
[101.72 - 107.28] wise but seriously when you think about
[103.88 - 111.60] that there's raw organic honey in this
[107.28 - 114.20] not garbage sugar garbage beet beet um
[111.60 - 116.36] dehydrated beet sugar all these other
[114.20 - 118.52] things that are in the other ones like
[116.36 - 122.12] because companies won't do this they
[118.52 - 125.00] won't do with them did right here and
[122.12 - 126.72] I'm blown off my seat when I had this in
[125.00 - 128.96] my hand right here I was just like oh my
[126.72 - 131.72] God I can't believe it finally an
[128.96 - 135.32] Elderberry product finally an Elderberry

[135.32 - 142.52] just want to show you right here okay
[137.36 - 144.68] it's really consistent really thick okay
[142.52 - 147.80] and I'll even pour a little bit more in
[144.68 - 149.24] there really thick really consistent all
[147.80 - 151.76] right I'm just pouring that in there I
[149.24 - 154.60] don't know if you can see see that seven
[151.76 - 157.52] times more potent the concentration is
[154.60 - 159.80] so so potent so that's the difference
[157.52 - 161.52] right there over anything so when it
[159.80 - 165.40] comes down to immune system immune
[161.52 - 167.16] Health immune anything and respiratory
[165.40 - 169.16] okay you're looking at something right
[167.16 - 170.52] there that's critical all right so I'm
[169.16 - 174.64] just going to put a little bit right
[170.52 - 176.12] here in this right off of here okay so
[174.64 - 177.72] I'm just showing you right here if you
[176.12 - 180.72] guys can see
[177.72 - 184.04] this nothing out there
[180.72 - 186.00] touches this right there I'm sure you
[184.04 - 188.04] know competitors are going to be all
[186.00 - 189.76] jealous and freaking out because of this
[188.04 - 192.12] product and they're going to try to
[189.76 - 194.92] create something and say oh yeah ours is
[192.12 - 197.28] good too you know that's going to happen
[194.92 - 199.32] but it's never going to touch this and
[197.28 - 202.44] what what happens with vimer G's they're
[199.32 - 208.04] so revolutionary with what they do it's
[202.44 - 210.44] insane I mean seriously but this is an
[208.04 - 212.60] entirely different
[210.44 - 215.28] Elderberry than what's out there in the
[212.60 - 218.64] world right now and that's what we need
[215.28 - 221.40] it's things like this that change the
[218.64 - 224.60] world of Health it's stuff like this
[221.40 - 227.20] that changes the world of Health okay is
[224.60 - 229.44] when it comes down to immune system you
[227.20 - 232.20] need every Fighting Chance if somebody
[229.44 - 234.20] has a symptom out there okay somebody
[232.20 - 236.20] has a symptom anybody that you know
[234.20 - 237.64] comes to me old friend or something
[236.20 - 241.20] they're like I got the symptom and I'm
[237.64 - 243.60] like ooh so sorry about your immune
[241.20 - 245.40] system like what are you talking about
[243.60 - 247.44] the the the doctor said nothing about my
[245.40 - 250.48] immune system nobody said anything about
[247.44 - 253.56] my immune system if you have a SI
[250.48 - 257.60] symptom if you have a condition it's an
[253.56 - 259.64] immune system problem already just right
[257.60 - 262.08] from the start and that's what people
[259.64 - 264.48] don't understand his immune system has
[262.08 - 266.28] everything to do with your symptoms and
[264.48 - 269.44] your conditions and what you're
[266.28 - 271.08] struggling with on that level physically
[269.44 - 273.44] if you break your leg and it doesn't
[271.08 - 276.52] heal as fast as the other guy there's a
[273.44 - 278.40] good chance there's a reason if you
[276.52 - 280.56] break your arm it doesn't heal as fast
[278.40 - 283.32] as the other guy there's a reason even
[280.56 - 285.92] breaks even bone breaks and things like
[283.32 - 289.08] that immune system assists with that
[285.92 - 292.12] immune system comes to the rescue it's a
[289.08 - 295.60] big part of how we stay healthy and heal
[292.12 - 297.24] faster immune cells so if you're immune
[295.60 - 300.44] deficient if your immune cells are
[297.24 - 303.08] actually on the lower scale if your bone
[300.44 - 305.44] marrow is not producing like it needs to
[303.08 - 308.56] produce or your immune cells are being
[305.44 - 311.92] eaten up and eaten up because of all the
[308.56 - 313.56] Predators that enter into our body
[311.92 - 316.44] that's something to know because that's
[313.56 - 319.52] what the bug world is really so the bug
[316.44 - 322.60] world they're Predators that's what the
[319.52 - 324.84] bug world is they get into the lymphatic
[322.60 - 327.08] system they get into all kinds of
[324.84 - 328.96] different areas of the body they enter
[327.08 - 331.64] in through the mouth they enter in
[328.96 - 334.16] through the eyes in the ears in the nose
[331.64 - 337.24] they enter in that way through the lungs
[334.16 - 339.48] we breathe those predators in right they
[337.24 - 341.76] enter through bodily fluids like sharing
[339.48 - 343.84] bodily fluids or running into a bodily
[341.76 - 347.28] fluid thing with somebody else whatever
[343.84 - 349.24] it is we get these bugs they go in us
[347.28 - 351.48] some are stealth some are more just
[349.24 - 354.16] flash in the pan aggressive with a big
[351.48 - 356.32] bang that's what bugs are like right but
[354.16 - 359.16] they Predators is what they are and
[356.32 - 361.40] they're there to actually beat somebody
[359.16 - 364.28] down they want to invade and if they're
[361.40 - 366.44] stealth viruses stealth bugs and
[364.28 - 369.20] different stealth kind of like pathogens
[366.44 - 372.20] they like to nest and they nest and they
[369.20 - 373.96] live and they stay in organs because our
[372.20 - 376.20] immune system is
[373.96 - 377.80] struggling that's how it works because
[376.20 - 379.60] our immune system is struggling people
[377.80 - 382.20] get the cold sores they get the herpes
[379.60 - 383.76] simplex one they get the herpes simplex
[382.20 - 385.64] right and they get the breakouts
[383.76 - 387.44] periodically and stuff immune systems
[385.64 - 389.20] always challenged they come out shingles
[387.44 - 391.60] whether it's non- rashing or some other
[389.20 - 392.72] form and they're actually struggling or
[391.60 - 394.20] they're dealing with some kind of
[392.72 - 395.64] fatigue but don't know why and they got
[394.20 - 398.68] the cyto megal virus they got the
[395.64 - 400.92] upsteam bar they got the hhv6 H h37 they
[398.68 - 403.08] have no idea all the different bugs that
[400.92 - 406.16] are out there right some are stealth
[403.08 - 407.80] some are flash in the pan Big Bang bugs
[406.16 - 409.40] that's what they are right like bugs
[407.80 - 411.00] that are going around and everything
[409.40 - 413.76] like that like the flues and so forth
[411.00 - 417.08] and all that but we need to feed our
[413.76 - 420.68] immune cells right they're hungry like
[417.08 - 421.72] we're hungry so keep that in mind so
[420.68 - 423.92] here's the thing I want to talk about
[421.72 - 427.16] Hunger for a minute right when we're
[423.92 - 431.68] hungry why are we really hungry what is
[427.16 - 434.64] calling for a hunger okay well our body
[431.68 - 437.24] systems become hungry right our brain
[434.64 - 440.48] becomes hungry our neurons become hungry
[437.24 - 442.84] right our body system becomes hungry
[440.48 - 445.36] it's not just like us it's not just us
[442.84 - 447.84] emotionally or consciously or
[445.36 - 450.68] subconsciously we're hungry or the fact
[447.84 - 452.44] that we need fuel right we need fuel for
[450.68 - 454.12] everyday maintenance and everything
[452.44 - 457.12] there's more than that there's deep
[454.12 - 460.12] seated hunger that rages inside of a lot
[457.12 - 462.60] of people because that appetite isn't
[460.12 - 465.16] just for our stomach it isn't just for
[462.60 - 467.92] us it's for us what that means is for
[465.16 - 470.96] every cell in the body immune cells take
[467.92 - 473.40] fuel that we consume and we eat and
[470.96 - 476.16] you're looking at something right here
[473.40 - 478.72] that's the vimergy right the vimergy
[476.16 - 482.48] Elderberry product in my hand right here
[478.72 - 484.56] seven times s more potent than anyone
[482.48 - 485.92] that's out there and I am excited to
[484.56 - 487.28] even say that because I can't even
[485.92 - 488.80] believe I'm holding that kind of product
[487.28 - 491.48] in my hand it's the kind of things that
[488.80 - 493.16] I dream about like I know that you guys
[491.48 - 494.64] you know you you probably know somebody
[493.16 - 496.08] that dreams about something different or
[494.64 - 497.44] maybe you dream about something
[496.08 - 500.04] different people want to dream about
[497.44 - 502.72] being on in paradise and Island and
[500.04 - 504.44] soaking up the Sun and holding a coconut
[502.72 - 506.92] in one hand and a mango in the other
[504.44 - 509.08] hand that's an incredible dream it is
[506.92 - 511.36] but what I do is I dream about what's

[513.88 - 520.56] and turn their lives around what's going
[516.64 - 521.92] to come out next right so my dreams
[520.56 - 524.08] they're kind of different they're not
[521.92 - 525.20] about being on a tropical island sure I
[524.08 - 526.88] could just you know what I could hang
[525.20 - 529.04] everything up and just hit a tropical
[526.88 - 531.04] island for a few years and I could sit
[529.04 - 533.04] there with with exactly cracking open
[531.04 - 535.36] coconuts that would be great and maybe I
[533.04 - 537.24] would take my my phone and do some
[535.36 - 539.00] selfies or something like that right
[537.24 - 540.20] that would be fun but that's not my
[539.00 - 543.84] dream
[540.20 - 547.12] my dream is something like this an
[543.84 - 549.72] Elderberry concoction an Elderberry
[547.12 - 551.88] Elixir that is seven times more potent
[549.72 - 554.12] than anything out there and that right

[592.92 - 598.56] can purchase it at vimergy.com V is inv
[595.68 - 600.04] Victor i m is in Mary E RG y guys I want
[598.56 - 601.68] to talk about the immun system I want to
[600.04 - 603.64] talk about how powerful and how
[601.68 - 605.28] incredible this product is and what's
[603.64 - 608.08] going on here and what's in my hands
[605.28 - 611.48] right here and the difference there's a
[608.08 - 613.96] difference this is incredible no fillers
[611.48 - 616.12] no garbage no beet sugar you guys you
[613.96 - 618.36] see you see sugar in those Elderberry
[616.12 - 622.16] syrups out there and stuff you see cane
[618.36 - 624.44] sugar yeah how was that cane raised what
[622.16 - 626.76] what what kind of contaminants that are
[624.44 - 628.96] in that cane it's not even just that
[626.76 - 631.12] they mix cane with other things sugars
[628.96 - 633.20] aren't just pure sugar anymore so when
[631.12 - 635.24] they put cane in there's a small tiny
[633.20 - 637.80] percentage of another type of sugar put
[635.24 - 639.80] in there and people don't even realize
[637.80 - 641.76] it so they could put cane sugar on a
[639.80 - 645.84] product but it but cane with something
[641.76 - 648.80] else right VY won't do that it won't go
[645.84 - 652.28] near that this is raw organic honey in
[648.80 - 654.88] this Elderberry Elixir seven times more
[652.28 - 658.20] potent than anything else out there that
[654.88 - 660.28] is insane right there okay so I want
[658.20 - 663.36] everybody to know what's happening okay
[660.28 - 665.88] so when we have problems we have immune
[663.36 - 667.96] system problems that's what happening
[665.88 - 670.40] and right now there's a massive meltdown
[667.96 - 673.36] on this planet Earth it's immune
[670.40 - 675.28] functions lowering you know they say
[673.36 - 677.80] things like this now right medical
[675.28 - 681.24] medium information called the shot first
[677.80 - 684.04] that life expectancy is dropping I said
[681.24 - 687.68] this for years I published this before
[684.04 - 689.84] science published their thing okay so
[687.68 - 692.40] science finally came out with it and
[689.84 - 694.00] said life expectancy is dropping it's
[692.40 - 695.40] dropping why is it dropping it's not
[694.00 - 698.40] supposed to be dropping it's supposed to
[695.40 - 701.04] be advancing it's supposed to be getting
[698.40 - 703.44] better and better and longer that's how
[701.04 - 705.44] it's supposed to go but it's dropping
[703.44 - 707.28] more people eating organic food more
[705.44 - 709.24] people you know doing what intermittent
[707.28 - 710.44] fasting more people you know eating
[709.24 - 711.88] better somewhere I'm not saying
[710.44 - 713.72] intermittent fasting is a good thing you
[711.88 - 715.32] know about medical me information I'm
[713.72 - 717.20] just saying more people are trying to
[715.32 - 719.04] take care of themselves and they're
[717.20 - 720.40] eating more fruits and vegetables and
[719.04 - 721.96] all all this other stuff they're staying
[720.40 - 723.68] away from processed food but this is
[721.96 - 726.32] what's happening though life expectancy
[723.68 - 729.72] is dropping dropping dropping because
[726.32 - 733.60] there's an immune deficiency an immune
[729.72 - 735.24] system problem on planet Earth right now
[733.60 - 737.48] and that's what's happening and there's
[735.24 - 739.48] stuff being dumped out of the sky every
[737.48 - 741.28] single day you guys know about that
[739.48 - 743.72] right dump stuff being dumped out of the
[741.28 - 746.00] sky everybody's breathing it in it's
[743.72 - 748.12] going on the skin lowers the immune
[746.00 - 751.36] system that's just one thing all on its
[748.12 - 753.12] own and they're releasing pathogens
[751.36 - 755.84] right now and they're releasing
[753.12 - 758.72] pathogens all the time periodically but
[755.84 - 761.64] the pathogen spill is happening and when
[758.72 - 763.48] they spill pathogens out there they want
[761.64 - 765.64] people to get them and get sick but
[763.48 - 769.24] people don't know how to protect
[765.64 - 772.44] themselves immune system wise that's why
[769.24 - 775.16] I love this being like soothe wise okay
[772.44 - 776.80] it's smart this is powerful for the
[775.16 - 779.32] immune system and
[776.80 - 781.20] respiratory respiratory
[779.32 - 782.92] right there and that's the thing it's
[781.20 - 785.04] okay it's like yeah yeah I picked up an
[782.92 - 786.68] Elderberry you know syrupy thing I
[785.04 - 788.32] picked up Elderberry well it's supposed
[786.68 - 791.04] to be good for the immune system
[788.32 - 794.20] supposed to be good for Respiratory um
[791.04 - 797.28] but is it but is it really but when you
[794.20 - 800.20] go seven times more potent with the
[797.28 - 802.36] highest quality Elderberry unlike other
[800.20 - 803.56] places they can get bottomed here okay
[802.36 - 805.64] here's what it is you want to start a
[803.56 - 806.96] supplement company go ahead start a
[805.64 - 808.32] supplement company and what you're going
[806.96 - 809.52] to do is you're going to buy the lower
[808.32 - 810.48] tiers they're going to going to say it's
[809.52 - 812.04] quality but you're going to buy the
[810.48 - 814.40] lower tier the reason why you're going
[812.04 - 816.80] to buy the lower tier is because of cost
[814.40 - 818.68] and so forth right that's one thing they
[816.80 - 820.36] tell you to buy the lower tier and then
[818.68 - 821.96] you buy the lower tier and you package
[820.36 - 824.52] it up and you go here's my Elderberry
[821.96 - 827.16] product and you put it out there right
[824.52 - 830.00] they don't do that they buy the top tier
[827.16 - 832.28] Elderberry the one that people don't buy
[830.00 - 834.24] so the industries don't buy you know
[832.28 - 836.72] supplement companies don't buy they
[834.24 - 839.36] actually use that one the one where it's
[836.72 - 841.40] like no no that's the Premier High
[839.36 - 843.64] quality and it's just too much it's too
[841.40 - 844.92] much for cost it's you know whatever and
[843.64 - 847.40] then the supplement companies they
[844.92 - 851.04] ignore that one and they buy that bulk
[847.40 - 853.04] bulk crap Elderberry and they put that
[851.04 - 855.16] into their their syrups right that's how
[853.04 - 857.32] it works vimergy doesn't do that they
[855.16 - 859.56] get the top tier and that's why I
[857.32 - 861.20] endorse these guys like I do that's why
[859.56 - 864.40] I work with these guys because I don't
[861.20 - 866.60] see that anywhere you guys I've tried
[864.40 - 868.28] I've tried to make friends with so many
[866.60 - 870.28] supplement companies throughout the
[868.28 - 872.84] years tried to make friends and then I
[870.28 - 874.88] talk to their CEOs I talk to the owners
[872.84 - 876.72] of their companies right out there and I
[874.88 - 878.52] say look why don't you guys do this just
[876.72 - 880.32] like no way sorry aw it's not going to
[878.52 - 883.12] happen I like you in all aw you're
[880.32 - 884.88] really cool guy you know and you do you
[883.12 - 886.24] do great work and great things out there
[884.88 - 889.24] but we're not going to do that as a
[886.24 - 892.76] company I ran into that every day out
[889.24 - 893.96] there and then vimer said no no no no no
[892.76 - 895.60] no we're not going to do it that way
[893.96 - 897.96] we're going to do the best of the best
[895.60 - 899.68] of the best of the best and that right
[897.96 - 902.52] there says everything and when it comes
[899.68 - 905.32] down to immune system people go they get
[902.52 - 908.32] glass some people just get glassed right
[905.32 - 910.60] they're just like immune system whatever
[908.32 - 913.00] oh yeah that's why people don't feel
[910.60 - 915.20] good okay they have symptoms conditions
[913.00 - 918.16] because their immune system is shot it's
[915.20 - 921.12] either shot struggling illing or just
[918.16 - 923.48] weakened or deficient any of those and
[921.12 - 925.84] all of those above people walk around
[923.48 - 929.76] with these immune systems that are
[925.84 - 932.16] struggling right so it is important end
[929.76 - 934.16] very important especially the stealth
[932.16 - 935.96] stuff that's spilled out there all the
[934.16 - 938.40] time especially other stuff that's
[935.96 - 940.92] spilled out there all the time that the
[938.40 - 943.64] that they put out there okay that they
[940.92 - 946.16] actually engineer so that's the
[943.64 - 948.44] Elderberry right there I want people to
[946.16 - 950.64] know about it it's called sooth wise
[948.44 - 954.32] check it out at diy.com the is and
[950.64 - 957.16] Victor i m is the mar ergy.com so you
[954.32 - 960.04] know it's there it is
[957.16 - 962.96] unbelievable stuff seven times more
[960.04 - 966.20] potent you can't go wrong raw organic
[962.96 - 968.16] honey in there so rapy over there on
[966.20 - 969.76] YouTube love this stuff and it tastes
[968.16 - 971.04] great it actually does taste great
[969.76 - 973.60] that's incredible and there's a little
[971.04 - 975.12] bit of lemon juice in there too little
[973.60 - 977.20] touch of that as well I'm pouring it
[975.12 - 978.80] right into here there it is you guys I
[977.20 - 981.40] don't know if you can see that but it's
[978.80 - 983.68] so incredible it's just so incredible
[981.40 - 985.12] I'm going to have to consume that
[983.68 - 987.96] because it's out of the bottle I'm
[985.12 - 989.72] actually dumping it all out lra 144 over
[987.96 - 991.36] there on YouTube says energy supplements
[989.72 - 993.76] really make a huge difference in my
[991.36 - 995.88] health they really do for so many people
[993.76 - 999.32] I know it's incredible so that's an
[995.88 - 1001.96] Elderberry right their respiratory
[999.32 - 1005.32] immune system because immune cells need
[1001.96 - 1006.88] to be fed and when you're using an
[1005.32 - 1009.28] Elderberry product like this and
[1006.88 - 1011.80] Elderberry Elixir like this you're
[1009.28 - 1013.28] feeding immune cells you got to think
[1011.80 - 1015.16] about it that way because that's what's
[1013.28 - 1017.92] going on you're feeding those immune
[1015.16 - 1019.80] cells and that's critical and people
[1017.92 - 1022.32] they walk around sick they walk around
[1019.80 - 1024.04] miserable right they're not well they
[1022.32 - 1027.80] have so many different symptoms those
[1024.04 - 1030.84] are immune system issues all to begin
[1027.80 - 1033.48] with starting from the beginning when
[1030.84 - 1036.28] they picked up an EBV when they picked
[1033.48 - 1038.48] up a cyto when they picked up anything
[1036.28 - 1040.68] like that a strep when they picked up
[1038.48 - 1043.60] anything like that they run into people
[1040.68 - 1046.96] they got sinusitis they got
[1043.60 - 1049.88] conjunctivitis they got sty they got UTI
[1046.96 - 1053.08] bladder infections kidney infection
[1049.88 - 1055.44] they got P they got all kinds of
[1053.08 - 1057.92] different things guys with PR prostate
[1055.44 - 1060.52] issues all of that stuff out there and
[1057.92 - 1062.92] it's like strap strap strap strap strap
[1060.52 - 1065.76] strap strap strap strap strap strap and
[1062.92 - 1067.64] it's like immune system is really going
[1065.76 - 1070.24] on there it's like how come your immune
[1067.64 - 1072.16] system is not beating down that strep
[1070.24 - 1074.60] how come your immune system is not
[1072.16 - 1076.52] pushing that back and holding that back

[1131.32 - 1137.24] people to know I want them to be armed
[1134.24 - 1139.16] armed and ready it's an important year
[1137.24 - 1142.00] for that because there's going to be

[1162.32 - 1165.80] right on my cutting board okay I want to
[1164.48 - 1167.68] talk about the immune system a little
[1165.80 - 1168.96] bit too so bear with me we'll get into
[1167.68 - 1170.84] that I want to talk about the liver
[1168.96 - 1173.68] immune systems right there liver immune
[1170.84 - 1176.08] system pancreas immune system I want to
[1173.68 - 1177.60] talk about immune system in the gut too
[1176.08 - 1179.08] and and all of that and how people were
[1177.60 - 1180.48] like immune systems all in the gut
[1179.08 - 1182.88] there's immune system in your gut for
[1180.48 - 1185.64] sure but there's more immune system all
[1182.88 - 1188.08] around your lymphatic system around your
[1185.64 - 1190.52] torso around your gut I want to go into
[1188.08 - 1192.68] that as well and then your bones
[1190.52 - 1194.84] producing immune cells how important
[1192.68 - 1197.08] that is your spleen if you still have
[1194.84 - 1199.48] one if you still have one how many
[1197.08 - 1203.84] people do I run across don't have a
[1199.48 - 1205.84] spleen anymore it blew up it blew up
[1203.84 - 1209.08] either from something like you know a
[1205.84 - 1211.80] reaction because it got injured or it
[1209.08 - 1213.76] blew up because just spontaneously on
[1211.80 - 1215.36] its own because of a viral infection
[1213.76 - 1217.08] they didn't know about because they just
[1215.36 - 1220.32] don't know nobody knows that that's what
[1217.08 - 1222.68] swells up those spleens like Epstein bar
[1220.32 - 1225.04] and all that people walk around with
[1222.68 - 1227.28] spleen issues immune system problems
[1225.04 - 1229.16] because of their spleen being really
[1227.28 - 1231.04] problematic really inflam
[1229.16 - 1232.64] that's something all on its own and the
[1231.04 - 1234.60] stuff they dump out there and put out
[1232.64 - 1236.84] there for people to breathe in and take
[1234.60 - 1238.48] in and ingest and everything knocks
[1236.84 - 1240.20] things down in the in the body I want to
[1238.48 - 1241.96] go into that as well so let me just show
[1240.20 - 1245.32] you a couple more things and anybody who
[1241.96 - 1249.00] just got on here I don't own vimergy I
[1245.32 - 1252.20] want to make that clear okay I just I I
[1249.00 - 1254.44] support them I endorse them I work with
[1252.20 - 1256.80] them on that because of the products but
[1254.44 - 1258.68] I don't have any stocks or shares don't
[1256.80 - 1259.92] own the company don't have a percentage
[1258.68 - 1262.44] of it I want to make that clear it's
[1259.92 - 1264.92] important to me because I I don't want
[1262.44 - 1267.76] people to think otherwise it's just a
[1264.92 - 1270.24] fact I personally trust these guys
[1267.76 - 1272.24] because these guys do it right I've
[1270.24 - 1274.72] become close friends with these guys
[1272.24 - 1276.36] over the years because they don't care
[1274.72 - 1278.36] about the out there and they
[1276.36 - 1280.40] just want to do it right they don't want
[1278.36 - 1283.44] to play the games that other supplement
[1280.40 - 1285.16] companies play I can't tell you the the
[1283.44 - 1286.92] doors that I've knocked on the people
[1285.16 - 1288.64] I've talked to in other supplement
[1286.92 - 1291.00] Brands supplement Brands you may even
[1288.64 - 1293.44] use every day and I talk to the heads of
[1291.00 - 1295.40] those companies the owners or the CEOs
[1293.44 - 1298.24] and it's the same old crap every time
[1295.40 - 1300.68] they won't change their standard of crap
[1298.24 - 1303.16] they won't Elevate they won't take it to
[1300.68 - 1305.48] the next level and vimergy does that is
[1303.16 - 1308.12] everything to me right there lupus
[1305.48 - 1310.68] freeze celery 333 which one supplement
[1308.12 - 1313.28] should we pack when traveling and what
[1310.68 - 1315.44] about the radiation does it affect our
[1313.28 - 1317.96] supplements in the
[1315.44 - 1320.24] airplane so another let me talk about
[1317.96 - 1322.56] airplane radiation for for one which is
[1320.24 - 1325.28] really important okay unless your
[1322.56 - 1327.92] supplements are actually opened on the
[1325.28 - 1329.52] airplane and Spilled Out everywhere if
[1327.92 - 1331.24] you took your supplements on the
[1329.52 - 1333.48] airplanes this is important and you
[1331.24 - 1335.52] dumped it all in a glass that was
[1333.48 - 1338.04] exposed in the open you're going to have
[1335.52 - 1339.76] particles radiation particles enter into
[1338.04 - 1341.60] that supplement of course if that's how
[1339.76 - 1343.56] you're doing it where if you take all
[1341.60 - 1345.08] your bottles and you expose it all is
[1343.56 - 1349.28] what I'm saying then you got the
[1345.08 - 1353.64] particles radiation in the sky most L is
[1349.28 - 1356.04] Fallout from World War II mostly not
[1353.64 - 1359.08] it's it's also other things too like
[1356.04 - 1361.68] what chobble or you know or
[1359.08 - 1363.28] Fukushima right so Fukushima is a big
[1361.68 - 1366.56] one right there so a lot of what
[1363.28 - 1368.40] happened with Fukushima was that when
[1366.56 - 1373.52] that all blew up when that reactor
[1368.40 - 1376.16] melted down okay it released so much
[1373.52 - 1378.96] radiation particles okay into the
[1376.16 - 1381.28] atmosphere when that thing blew up
[1378.96 - 1382.80] that those radiation particles they're
[1381.28 - 1385.00] floating around everywhere they're in
[1382.80 - 1388.52] the atmosphere floating around World War
[1385.00 - 1390.96] II right heroshima right the big bomb
[1388.52 - 1392.64] that is still up in our our skies
[1390.96 - 1395.28] floating around the atmosphere the upper
[1392.64 - 1398.32] atmosphere too really like concentrated
[1395.28 - 1401.56] up there it comes down all the time we
[1398.32 - 1403.60] get radiation exposure every single day
[1401.56 - 1405.88] you don't get radiation exposure because
[1403.60 - 1408.16] the sun technically is giving you
[1405.88 - 1409.96] radiation exposure because you'll hear
[1408.16 - 1411.24] that that right there is just something
[1409.96 - 1412.56] that's really interesting too that I
[1411.24 - 1414.80] hear all the time it's like oh the sun's
[1412.56 - 1417.24] giving you radiation exposure it's like
[1414.80 - 1420.68] really what it is is when you're laying
[1417.24 - 1422.16] out in the sun and your clothes are off
[1420.68 - 1424.08] because you're wearing you know your
[1422.16 - 1425.76] swim trunks or your your bikini or
[1424.08 - 1429.12] something your swimsuit when you're
[1425.76 - 1431.52] doing that it's exposure from particles
[1429.12 - 1434.76] it's particles landing on us every
[1431.52 - 1437.96] single day radiation exposure we get
[1434.76 - 1440.92] every single day that's how it works
[1437.96 - 1443.16] because of of Chernobyl and Fukushima
[1440.92 - 1446.60] and the big bomb and then nuclear
[1443.16 - 1449.32] experiments nuclear nuclear testing in
[1446.60 - 1452.48] the middle of the country on fed lands
[1449.32 - 1454.52] right because did you know that there's
[1452.48 - 1457.24] this many people in the just in the us
[1454.52 - 1460.56] alone right compared to the vast amount
[1457.24 - 1463.40] of land in the US that's uninhabited is
[1460.56 - 1465.92] that insane they're like oh no there's
[1463.40 - 1467.72] too much too many people population is
[1465.92 - 1470.16] out of control there's way too many
[1467.72 - 1472.40] people on the plane really yeah yeah 8
[1470.16 - 1474.28] billion is way too many pushing on 9
[1472.40 - 1476.04] billion going to be way too many we
[1474.28 - 1478.88] population's out of control it's taking
[1476.04 - 1481.64] up too much space really because this
[1478.88 - 1484.44] much of the US is just taken up that
[1481.64 - 1486.84] much small tiny little pockets right the
[1484.44 - 1488.80] rest of it is tons and tons and tons and
[1486.84 - 1490.84] tons and thousands and thousands and
[1488.80 - 1493.04] thousands hundred thousands of Acres
[1490.84 - 1494.88] that are not being used that are owned
[1493.04 - 1498.12] right by the gov or owned by like the
[1494.88 - 1498.88] feds or they're like they're owned by by
[1498.12 - 1500.68] right
[1498.88 - 1503.60] the Industries or they're owned by
[1500.68 - 1505.40] something and they're all just out there
[1503.60 - 1508.52] not nothing happening and that's where
[1505.40 - 1510.52] you got all the area 51 crap going on
[1508.52 - 1513.24] that's where all the chemtrail planes
[1510.52 - 1515.80] are landing they're landing on strips no
[1513.24 - 1518.48] one sees right you don't see the
[1515.80 - 1522.12] chemtrail planes landing at the
[1518.48 - 1525.12] airport at JFK You Don't See You Don't
[1522.12 - 1527.76] See LAX you don't see airplanes coming
[1525.12 - 1529.52] in all day long in LAX and they're all
[1527.76 - 1532.08] the you know chemtrail planes you don't
[1529.52 - 1533.88] see that and Only One Pilot gets out no
[1532.08 - 1536.08] passengers get out you don't see that
[1533.88 - 1538.44] where do they go they land in the middle
[1536.08 - 1540.12] of the US they land in places nobody
[1538.44 - 1542.12] sees that all that land that's
[1540.12 - 1545.04] uninhabited all that that's how it's
[1542.12 - 1548.24] done that's how it works very few people
[1545.04 - 1550.08] are really in this country compared to
[1548.24 - 1552.04] how much space and land there is which
[1550.08 - 1553.44] is a whole another talk a whole another
[1552.04 - 1555.68] whole another thing that I want to get
[1553.44 - 1559.12] into sometime because it's interesting
[1555.68 - 1560.64] as heck how it works and and so let's go
[1559.12 - 1563.60] back to radiation a little bit so
[1560.64 - 1565.96] radiation exposure in the planes is
[1563.60 - 1569.00] mostly not all of it but mostly from
[1565.96 - 1571.48] particle exposure and that particle
[1569.00 - 1572.80] exposure is because of the the radiation
[1571.48 - 1575.08] the atmosphere that's floating around
[1572.80 - 1578.48] from Fukushima so forth from the bomb
[1575.08 - 1580.60] World War II from from right Chernobyl
[1578.48 - 1583.68] from experiments that are happening in
[1580.60 - 1586.88] the in in places people are not living
[1583.68 - 1588.52] and so forth out there right on on land
[1586.88 - 1590.08] out there that's being tested sitting
[1588.52 - 1594.08] there testing all kinds of different
[1590.08 - 1596.48] things so that's where that exposure
[1594.08 - 1598.88] comes from okay so you don't have to
[1596.48 - 1600.80] worry about supplementation on that
[1598.88 - 1603.08] level or anything like that and when it
[1600.80 - 1604.76] comes down to like things you know um
[1603.08 - 1606.60] let's see J over there on YouTube what
[1604.76 - 1610.04] about airport scanners good question
[1606.60 - 1611.52] there like first of all like I I get the
[1610.04 - 1613.72] pat Downs just letting you know that's
[1611.52 - 1615.44] one thing right I'll get a pat down so
[1613.72 - 1617.28] when I go through the airport that's
[1615.44 - 1620.60] what I do all right remember this one
[1617.28 - 1623.40] time I was waiting for a pat down for 45
[1620.60 - 1626.24] minutes okay so was standing there in my
[1623.40 - 1628.48] socks and in those 45 minutes every now
[1626.24 - 1630.00] and then someone be like Aw what are you
[1628.48 - 1631.64] doing there they'd be going through the
[1630.00 - 1633.72] scanner they'd be getting into the
[1631.64 - 1636.72] scanner and be
[1633.72 - 1639.12] like they come out of it right and in
[1636.72 - 1640.80] those 45 minutes this one time there's
[1639.12 - 1642.76] like a family I was like oh my God it's
[1640.80 - 1644.80] medical medium right and I was standing
[1642.76 - 1646.56] there in my socks right the whole bit
[1644.80 - 1648.24] and they're like oh my God oh my God and
[1646.56 - 1649.80] the other people it happened like over
[1648.24 - 1652.84] and over on and off but the point is
[1649.80 - 1655.20] that I was like and I'd be like hey hey
[1652.84 - 1657.72] why are you going in the scanner why are
[1655.20 - 1659.48] you going into the scanner you know like
[1657.72 - 1660.68] are you going in the scanner like yeah
[1659.48 - 1662.00] of course we're going in the scanner
[1660.68 - 1664.80] boop boop boop they go in the scanner
[1662.00 - 1667.64] it's like I'm getting a pat down for a
[1664.80 - 1670.08] reason so I don't go into that scanner
[1667.64 - 1672.32] but it's just you know I've talked about
[1670.08 - 1673.84] that over the years for sure but the
[1672.32 - 1675.28] bottom line is what about the scanner
[1673.84 - 1677.72] you mean the scanner where you put the
[1675.28 - 1679.76] luggage in and you got your your 2 oz
[1677.72 - 1681.64] supplement and stuff like that and you
[1679.76 - 1686.28] they go through the luggage that the SC
[1681.64 - 1689.00] it's worth still taking even with that
[1686.28 - 1692.72] even with that exposure it's worth
[1689.00 - 1694.80] taking so I'll put the 2 O bottles you
[1692.72 - 1696.88] know or I'll put my supplements in 2 OZ
[1694.80 - 1699.36] containers I'll put those in the bag
[1696.88 - 1702.36] McCaron I'll have it go through that
[1699.36 - 1704.08] that you know radiation detector scanner
[1702.36 - 1705.92] right where they where they take that
[1704.08 - 1708.84] the images of your your luggage that I
[1705.92 - 1710.52] talk about in the books and and I'll do
[1708.84 - 1712.56] that and I'll be like okay there's
[1710.52 - 1714.16] definitely going to be a small amount
[1712.56 - 1716.60] but it's not going to touch what this is
[1714.16 - 1719.56] going to do for me on my you know on my
[1716.60 - 1721.64] travels on my trip it's not going to
[1719.56 - 1723.08] touch what it can do for me it's not
[1721.64 - 1724.20] going to touch what the zinc can do for
[1723.08 - 1726.60] me it's not going to touch what the
[1724.20 - 1728.28] golden seal can do for me it's not going
[1726.60 - 1730.40] to touch that I'm just letting you know
[1728.28 - 1733.20] so don't panic there okay so very
[1730.40 - 1735.96] important to know right there so yeah
[1733.20 - 1739.04] all right so when traveling these are
[1735.96 - 1742.28] some of the top supplements I would take
[1739.04 - 1745.84] with me I'm going to take with me matter
[1742.28 - 1749.72] of fact okay so one is propolis right
[1745.84 - 1752.68] there it's a must for me I love it I
[1749.72 - 1755.52] know what it has the power to do I know
[1752.68 - 1759.36] how good it is I know the quality of
[1755.52 - 1763.00] this any propolis that I take that isn't
[1759.36 - 1766.24] this one I just scream poison that's
[1763.00 - 1767.64] what I scream it's like poison you taste
[1766.24 - 1770.68] the alcohol I don't care if it says
[1767.64 - 1774.08] alcohol you taste the alcohol you taste
[1770.68 - 1775.88] that garbage you know it's burnt yep
[1774.08 - 1780.12] burnt you guys know how I showed you
[1775.88 - 1782.88] that before this propolis is not burnt
[1780.12 - 1785.84] it is there's nothing like that out
[1782.88 - 1789.04] there is the propolis pure the coratin
[1785.84 - 1792.80] in it alone is a reason to actually take
[1789.04 - 1795.56] it okay the coratin in this alone is
[1792.80 - 1797.20] good reason to take it I'm just saying
[1795.56 - 1798.36] I'm not saying go out and take hortin
[1797.20 - 1803.00] because that's not going to it's not
[1798.36 - 1806.28] going to help dead coratin in a bottle
[1803.00 - 1808.44] in capsules does not help that's I'm
[1806.28 - 1811.72] going to tell you right now coratin
[1808.44 - 1815.44] that's alive active coratin that's in
[1811.72 - 1817.84] the propolis pure makes the difference
[1815.44 - 1821.76] that is another story right there the
[1817.84 - 1825.20] active living corsin polyol in the
[1821.76 - 1828.56] propis pure is another level Next Level
[1825.20 - 1831.20] so that's right there um
[1828.56 - 1835.64] I take these daily for my immune system
[1831.20 - 1838.20] but I take them for also for protection
[1835.64 - 1841.40] of bugs going around so it's about
[1838.20 - 1844.68] protection I like that I like feeling
[1841.40 - 1847.56] that I'm being very smart about stuff
[1844.68 - 1848.92] which is important so on on the
[1847.56 - 1852.24] Elderberry I just want to talk about
[1848.92 - 1855.24] this one last one last moment
[1852.24 - 1859.08] here there's nothing out there that's
[1855.24 - 1863.28] seven times more potent like this this
[1859.08 - 1865.72] is game Cher bottom line experience it
[1863.28 - 1869.92] if you if you can get a chance and get a
[1865.72 - 1872.56] bottle in your hand it is unbelievable
[1869.92 - 1873.72] when you taste this and you use it
[1872.56 - 1875.36] you're going to be like you could and
[1873.72 - 1877.32] then if you ever did a taste test thing
[1875.36 - 1879.24] like that's what I did I did earlier
[1877.32 - 1882.20] it's like I got some some of the top
[1879.24 - 1885.32] leading brands of elderbury top leading
[1882.20 - 1887.64] Brands okay and I put it side by side
[1885.32 - 1890.00] and tasted it and it was like oh
[1887.64 - 1892.44] couldn't never ever take anything like
[1890.00 - 1894.72] that that's the difference right there
[1892.44 - 1898.24] respiratory important for the
[1894.72 - 1899.68] respiratory system right there the lungs
[1898.24 - 1900.96] very important so I want to talk about
[1899.68 - 1902.88] the immune system with the lungs and
[1900.96 - 1905.08] everything else Mar over there at
[1902.88 - 1907.36] YouTube I always travel with propolis
[1905.08 - 1908.96] and I am happy I drank it directly from
[1907.36 - 1912.96] the bottle I drink it directly from the
[1908.96 - 1915.96] bottle I do when I came to LA in June
[1912.96 - 1918.80] this propus helped me so good I did not
[1915.96 - 1922.56] pick anything up from the airport and I
[1918.80 - 1925.44] usually do okay okay so that's what I do
[1922.56 - 1927.56] too I don't use the dropper I take the
[1925.44 - 1929.96] dropper off put a little of whatever the
[1927.56 - 1932.32] dropper in my mouth like that and I
[1929.96 - 1934.76] actually just do that I take a a little
[1932.32 - 1937.20] Swig off the propolis bottle that's how
[1934.76 - 1940.36] I take it doesn't mean you you should do
[1937.20 - 1943.40] that but that's what I do
[1940.36 - 1946.52] um say suus aw can you please show us
[1943.40 - 1948.36] the continuity test again I love the
[1946.52 - 1949.96] continuity test I love it
[1948.36 - 1952.52] love it so okay there's a couple of
[1949.96 - 1955.28] different continuity tests that so has
[1952.52 - 1958.08] taught me throughout the years okay so I
[1955.28 - 1962.72] have what I do is is I hold it in my
[1958.08 - 1967.44] hand okay and and
[1962.72 - 1969.20] then okay I touch my head and you that's
[1967.44 - 1972.04] just one right but this is one I've been
[1969.20 - 1974.04] doing a lot and I might have shown you
[1972.04 - 1976.44] this one before right you guys but you
[1974.04 - 1980.20] hold it in your hand and you touch your
[1976.44 - 1982.16] head okay that's what you do and when
[1980.20 - 1984.36] you get a chance to do that that's
[1982.16 - 1987.00] that's that's a continuity test that I
[1984.36 - 1988.60] do and you can feel the difference if
[1987.00 - 1990.68] you take another
[1988.60 - 1992.60] Elderberry right product that's out
[1990.68 - 1995.12] there and you do that you'll see the
[1992.60 - 1999.88] difference okay from something that's
[1995.12 - 2004.00] pure and not congested with bad alcohols
[1999.88 - 2007.24] bad cane sugars okay bad water because
[2004.00 - 2009.40] that's what they do they mix bad water
[2007.24 - 2011.76] with into the Elderberry syrups that's
[2009.40 - 2014.80] what they do they mix bad water in this
[2011.76 - 2016.92] Elderberry product there's no water
[2014.80 - 2019.12] they're not adding water and that's
[2016.92 - 2021.44] important to know it's a continuity test
[2019.12 - 2023.40] you can put your hand right on your head
[2021.44 - 2025.76] and you can feel it what you're feeling
[2023.40 - 2027.16] is right you're feeling the energy
[2025.76 - 2028.76] you'll feel the difference when you
[2027.16 - 2031.44] actually hold on to anything that's
[2028.76 - 2034.68] vimergy so when you do that and you do
[2031.44 - 2038.56] this you'll feel it it's it's it's a
[2034.68 - 2042.20] clear feeling it's not painful it's not
[2038.56 - 2043.80] congestive it's not like impeded and you
[2042.20 - 2045.28] can feel that with other products when
[2043.80 - 2048.36] you put your hand on top of your head
[2045.28 - 2051.28] like this okay and you hold the product
[2048.36 - 2053.16] you can feel the imped in the product
[2051.28 - 2055.40] it's really it's incredible that's just
[2053.16 - 2058.56] a that was in a nutshell real
[2055.40 - 2062.48] quick if we drink our supplements from
[2058.56 - 2065.16] the bottle does it leave bacteria stepen
[2062.48 - 2067.00] I never worry about that I don't you can
[2065.16 - 2069.24] if you're concerned about that do the
[2067.00 - 2072.52] dropper that's why the dropper there for
[2069.24 - 2074.72] all kinds of reasons right but I'm not
[2072.52 - 2076.76] worried um when I drink it from the
[2074.72 - 2078.96] bottle I'm not worried about bacteria
[2076.76 - 2083.08] first of all I'm not worried about
[2078.96 - 2087.40] bacteria trying to survive in that right
[2083.08 - 2088.84] there I if it's your bottle only then
[2087.40 - 2090.84] well here's the thing if you're sharing
[2088.84 - 2093.60] it that's another story if you're like
[2090.84 - 2096.76] hey dude you need a swig of this and
[2093.60 - 2098.12] some some guy on the street takes this
[2096.76 - 2099.96] thanks you know what I mean hands it
[2098.12 - 2103.44] back to you yeah I'm worried about
[2099.96 - 2106.56] bacteria yeah I'm worried about bacteria
[2103.44 - 2110.44] right there but if it's just you and
[2106.56 - 2112.96] you're doing it another story okay or
[2110.44 - 2115.36] you picked up a bug you picked up a flu
[2112.96 - 2117.24] family member didn't and then you're
[2115.36 - 2118.80] swigging it and you're saying to you
[2117.24 - 2122.04] know family member to use it no that's
[2118.80 - 2125.72] another story too okay but if it's you
[2122.04 - 2129.08] and you're a bug I'm not worried no I'm
[2125.72 - 2132.16] not and that's what they do
[2129.08 - 2135.68] continuity look the continuity test
[2132.16 - 2136.84] explanate so seeing the comments fly up
[2135.68 - 2141.24] right now so I'm trying to catch a
[2136.84 - 2144.12] couple while I'm talking right here
[2141.24 - 2146.04] um so listen so there's a couple things
[2144.12 - 2148.80] you can do with the continuity test okay
[2146.04 - 2151.88] so I want to I want to run by a couple
[2148.80 - 2156.16] more you know aspects of it right
[2151.88 - 2158.60] so Puris pure is active right like like
[2156.16 - 2160.32] it's got the six Active polyphenols like
[2158.60 - 2163.20] the cortin right there's nothing like it
[2160.32 - 2167.80] in the propolis world nothing like it
[2163.20 - 2171.56] okay and that's an energy from like a
[2167.80 - 2176.24] living be product like this there's an
[2171.56 - 2179.52] energy in there right continuity test is
[2176.24 - 2181.72] something that the bottle I just threw
[2179.52 - 2184.80] that bottle and caught it okay
[2181.72 - 2188.40] continuity test okay is when you put
[2184.80 - 2192.64] your hand on your head okay and that
[2188.40 - 2196.00] continuity the connection from your head
[2192.64 - 2198.68] to your hand where the bottle is all
[2196.00 - 2200.20] right and what you're doing instead of
[2198.68 - 2202.88] your arm being out instead of your arm
[2200.20 - 2206.00] and hand being out here okay you're
[2202.88 - 2208.00] connecting it back right here to the
[2206.00 - 2210.00] neurons to your Consciousness
[2208.00 - 2212.84] subconscious to your soul you're
[2210.00 - 2215.28] connecting it right there you're holding
[2212.84 - 2218.04] the product in your hand like this and
[2215.28 - 2220.64] that energy is running up your arm it's
[2218.04 - 2223.00] running up your arm like that and what
[2220.64 - 2225.96] you're doing is you're making the
[2223.00 - 2228.08] continuity happen between your head and
[2225.96 - 2230.00] the product in your hand is what you're
[2228.08 - 2232.04] doing versus holding the product in your
[2230.00 - 2233.64] hand like this okay now you're going to
[2232.04 - 2236.12] make that continuity happen and you're
[2233.64 - 2239.08] going to actually off boom and there it
[2236.12 - 2241.76] is okay and you'll feel it and you'll
[2239.08 - 2243.96] know you'll know right there when you're
[2241.76 - 2245.48] actually holding these what's going on
[2243.96 - 2247.80] there I'm going to do more in depth on
[2245.48 - 2250.60] that too we'll do one where it's just on
[2247.80 - 2255.08] that because there's a lot going on
[2250.60 - 2257.24] there why do I always get sick when I'm
[2255.08 - 2260.44] traveling are you putting stuff in your
[2257.24 - 2263.32] mouth are you are you doing um are you
[2260.44 - 2265.08] doing like an alcohol wipe on your hands
[2263.32 - 2267.04] when you're traveling are you grabbing
[2265.08 - 2268.52] all the door knobs are you grabbing you
[2267.04 - 2270.88] know all are you hitting all the plane
[2268.52 - 2274.20] button seats and then you're not you're
[2270.88 - 2275.84] not like you can touch anything you want
[2274.20 - 2278.44] but you just you don't all of a sudden
[2275.84 - 2280.60] start eating eating
[2278.44 - 2282.12] with your hands if you you could touch
[2280.60 - 2283.92] anything you want you want to touch this
[2282.12 - 2285.60] door handle you want to touch this you
[2283.92 - 2287.88] want to pull this tray down in front of
[2285.60 - 2290.36] you on the plane if there's a tray does
[2287.88 - 2292.04] it matter if somebody puked on that tray
[2290.36 - 2294.40] you know like a month ago and there's
[2292.04 - 2296.32] still little remes all over it your
[2294.40 - 2297.60] residue you you're using your hands
[2296.32 - 2301.24] everywhere right you're touching
[2297.60 - 2302.96] everything great nothing wrong with that
[2301.24 - 2304.48] but then all of a sudden your finger's
[2302.96 - 2307.16] in your
[2304.48 - 2309.04] eye you're not thinking maybe you're
[2307.16 - 2311.12] watching a movie on the
[2309.04 - 2312.88] plane yeah you're watching a movie on
[2311.12 - 2315.08] the plane and your finger's now in your
[2312.88 - 2318.88] eye your finger's in your ear your
[2315.08 - 2321.96] finger's in your mouth that's why that
[2318.88 - 2324.08] is why the big reason probably the
[2321.96 - 2325.60] number one reason why people actually
[2324.08 - 2326.80] get things traveling because it's
[2325.60 - 2328.08] different when you're in a house and
[2326.80 - 2329.40] you're touching everything in your house
[2328.08 - 2330.76] or your apartment or something it's
[2329.40 - 2332.84] different but when you're out there and
[2330.76 - 2335.48] you're grabbing everything and you're
[2332.84 - 2336.68] touching everything it's another story
[2335.48 - 2338.04] cuz you're putting it in your mouth
[2336.68 - 2340.48] you're putting it in your your eyes
[2338.04 - 2343.84] everybody rubs their eyes they rub their
[2340.48 - 2345.80] eyes um thought garden over there and IG
[2343.84 - 2348.28] says any tips for not getting sick when
[2345.80 - 2350.80] traveling this is the big one right here
[2348.28 - 2353.60] it's all about your hands because that's
[2350.80 - 2356.00] what I do I if I'm not
[2353.60 - 2356.92] traveling and I have to go somewhere and
[2356.00 - 2359.24] do
[2356.92 - 2362.12] something right and I got to open up
[2359.24 - 2363.96] doors or whatever it is out there or I
[2362.12 - 2365.64] have to go somewhere or I got to shake
[2363.96 - 2368.16] somebody's hand right and got Shake
[2365.64 - 2370.44] somebody's hand okay I'm not going to
[2368.16 - 2372.40] take my hand and then just do this thing
[2370.44 - 2374.16] where I put my fingers on my tongue to
[2372.40 - 2376.80] try to get some moisture on my fingers
[2374.16 - 2378.60] so I can move some papers around oh yeah
[2376.80 - 2380.68] hold on I got some papers I'm Shuffling
[2378.60 - 2382.76] through right here okay sure all right
[2380.68 - 2384.44] yep yep hold on hold on all right yep
[2382.76 - 2386.44] just lick in my hand right here like
[2384.44 - 2388.36] that licking my fingers okay there we go
[2386.44 - 2390.40] nice to meet you there yep nice to meet
[2388.36 - 2392.56] you too okay great let me just stick my
[2390.40 - 2394.08] finger on my on my tongue and so I can
[2392.56 - 2396.76] do these papers right here here's a
[2394.08 - 2399.40] paper for you here's a paper for you oh
[2396.76 - 2401.16] nice to meet shoe too yep oh oh oh I
[2399.40 - 2404.04] need some grip on these papers let me
[2401.16 - 2408.12] just got my tongue there perfect here
[2404.04 - 2408.12] you go here you go sick with the flu
[2411.96 - 2416.92] now the other thing is is are you giving
[2414.80 - 2420.04] your immune system enough support so if
[2416.92 - 2422.16] you do lick your finger if you do lick
[2420.04 - 2425.20] your finger after it was touching the
[2422.16 - 2426.84] bathroom door in the bathroom sink it's
[2425.20 - 2428.76] another thing too you're traveling
[2426.84 - 2432.08] you're in the you're in the airport
[2428.76 - 2435.72] bathroom right and I talk about this
[2432.08 - 2437.16] flush the toilet before you do your
[2435.72 - 2439.92] thing if you're going to do an
[2437.16 - 2442.88] elimination in that toilet flush the
[2439.92 - 2444.68] toilet that's what I do I I flush it I
[2442.88 - 2446.32] go in there and I'm like well before I
[2444.68 - 2448.60] do an elimination right here in this
[2446.32 - 2451.32] toilet ball right here I'm going to make
[2448.60 - 2454.68] sure I get a clean flush going on so I
[2451.32 - 2457.84] might even lift up my leg and and hit
[2454.68 - 2459.64] the handle if I don't have a handy on me
[2457.84 - 2461.48] right there if I don't have any kind of
[2459.64 - 2463.12] Handy wipes on me or anything like that
[2461.48 - 2464.68] or I don't have a paper towel on me or
[2463.12 - 2467.28] something like I carry like a paper
[2464.68 - 2469.16] towel or something in my shirt pocket so
[2467.28 - 2471.04] I can take the paper towel out and if I
[2469.16 - 2473.12] got a flush toil at the airport I'll use
[2471.04 - 2475.48] the paper towel like that right I'm not
[2473.12 - 2476.96] going to touch the handle on the toilet
[2475.48 - 2478.64] I know there's a lot of toilets now that
[2476.96 - 2480.96] they're just it's automatic it just
[2478.64 - 2482.40] happens right but I'm just saying it's
[2480.96 - 2484.00] okay let's talk about the sink same
[2482.40 - 2485.16] thing with the sink and other things too
[2484.00 - 2487.56] there's a lot of them that aren't
[2485.16 - 2489.36] automatic but the point is I'm not going
[2487.56 - 2491.52] to just touch the toilet bowl handle and
[2489.36 - 2493.64] be like okay all right yeah what's going
[2491.52 - 2496.28] on here H let me think here got my
[2493.64 - 2497.84] finger in my mouth H thinking hard who I
[2496.28 - 2499.68] just give myself like five different
[2497.84 - 2501.44] bugs so you got to just be really
[2499.68 - 2503.84] careful like rubbing the eyes the whole
[2501.44 - 2505.56] bit you get tired I mean I've traveled
[2503.84 - 2507.52] with people and they've touched
[2505.56 - 2509.12] everything everything under the sun
[2507.52 - 2511.08] practically that they shouldn't be
[2509.12 - 2513.24] touching out there while traveling and
[2511.08 - 2514.84] then I'm watching they're like they're
[2513.24 - 2516.64] falling asleep or something you know
[2514.84 - 2518.20] they're whatever like we're we're in a
[2516.64 - 2520.32] waiting room somewhere we're in some
[2518.20 - 2522.36] chairs at the airport in the lounge and
[2520.32 - 2524.72] they're falling asleep and they're
[2522.36 - 2527.16] rubbing their eyes really hard you know
[2524.72 - 2528.80] after they just touched everything I see
[2527.16 - 2532.20] this all the time out there it just
[2528.80 - 2535.48] happens all right so there are things
[2532.20 - 2537.00] you can do to prevent getting sick and
[2535.48 - 2539.44] protecting your immune system that's one
[2537.00 - 2541.68] of them and now there's a whole look
[2539.44 - 2544.44] there's a whole thought out there that
[2541.68 - 2546.80] the more you get exposure to the
[2544.44 - 2550.20] stronger you get that's not necessarily
[2546.80 - 2552.92] true no it's not it's not how it works
[2550.20 - 2555.16] right you you want to if you get exposed
[2552.92 - 2556.56] you get exposed if you catch a flu you
[2555.16 - 2558.00] catch a flu if you get sick with
[2556.56 - 2560.32] something you get sick with something
[2558.00 - 2562.24] yeah and you address it you take care of
[2560.32 - 2564.44] it you do the right things for yourself
[2562.24 - 2566.80] you keep your immune system strong you
[2564.44 - 2568.76] do like you know the shock therapies
[2566.80 - 2571.56] whatever it is that you got to do but
[2568.76 - 2574.32] keep in mind though like keeping from
[2571.56 - 2576.72] Catching things by having these you know
[2574.32 - 2579.08] these the this information of not
[2576.72 - 2581.44] rubbing your eyes your ears picking your
[2579.08 - 2583.92] nose putting your hands in your mouth
[2581.44 - 2585.72] when traveling and so forth you know not
[2583.92 - 2587.80] sanitizing your hands once in a while or
[2585.72 - 2589.40] giving them a wash keep that in mind
[2587.80 - 2591.40] that is important to do so you're not
[2589.40 - 2596.84] catching everything under the Sun out
[2591.40 - 2598.60] there so um so 4 oz bottles vmer has 4
[2596.84 - 2602.32] oz bottles out there you guys I'm just
[2598.60 - 2605.24] going grab one right here and
[2602.32 - 2607.16] um they got they got 4 o bottles out
[2605.24 - 2609.36] there so the refills which is really Co
[2607.16 - 2610.80] cool so they're refill 8 O bottles is
[2609.36 - 2613.20] what I mean that's what they have out
[2610.80 - 2616.92] there I forgot to always tell you um
[2613.20 - 2618.52] which is incredible so 4 oz bottles
[2616.92 - 2622.08] that's what these are so keep that in
[2618.52 - 2624.40] mind which is incredible these are big
[2622.08 - 2627.44] bottles all in their own there's the 8 O
[2624.40 - 2630.04] refill but there's the 4 o bottles so
[2627.44 - 2631.92] it's not 1 o bottles so that's another
[2630.04 - 2634.48] thing somebody will be like cost-wise
[2631.92 - 2638.88] it's like oh yeah I just I just paid
[2634.48 - 2642.24] $112 for a 1 o bottle or $20 for a 1o
[2638.88 - 2644.16] bottle and meanwhile 4 o bottles it's
[2642.24 - 2645.28] different it's a whole different story
[2644.16 - 2647.80] you know that's what's incredible and
[2645.28 - 2650.08] then you got your 8 O bottles that's
[2647.80 - 2653.32] your 8 O bottle refill bottles and you
[2650.08 - 2655.36] save money with the refill bottles keep
[2653.32 - 2658.88] that in mind you do save money in fact
[2655.36 - 2661.20] the B12 refill makes it less expensive
[2658.88 - 2664.20] than competitors out there people don't
[2661.20 - 2665.48] realize that in the 8 O refill bottle so
[2664.20 - 2667.24] I just wanted to show you that right
[2665.48 - 2668.76] there all right let's talk about the
[2667.24 - 2670.28] immune system a little and I'm going to
[2668.76 - 2673.52] cover a few more things right here I'm
[2670.28 - 2676.12] also going to make let me make
[2673.52 - 2677.60] a right there that's the propolis right
[2676.12 - 2680.44] there so I got some propolis in there
[2677.60 - 2683.60] let make a little bit of a swig that's
[2680.44 - 2685.04] what I call it little bit of a swig here
[2683.60 - 2687.28] so I'm going to actually add some
[2685.04 - 2688.56] propolis in there this is what I did
[2687.28 - 2692.80] right here I'm going to show you right
[2688.56 - 2692.80] now okay there's a golden seal right
[2693.24 - 2701.32] there never ever ever never
[2697.28 - 2704.04] underestimate golden seal uh-uh never
[2701.32 - 2706.64] underestimate golden seal there's some
[2704.04 - 2710.60] golden seal right there it's not burnt
[2706.64 - 2713.40] okay potent but not burnt there's a big
[2710.60 - 2714.68] difference right there just so you know
[2713.40 - 2717.76] and what you see out there with all the
[2714.68 - 2721.08] tinctures is they're burnt you'll see
[2717.76 - 2722.84] the color but yet the potency is here
[2721.08 - 2728.48] which is incredible but they're not
[2722.84 - 2730.56] burnt all right so um I got a 8 O refill
[2728.48 - 2734.80] right there of the B12 liquid B12 which
[2730.56 - 2736.92] is incredible so per milliliter it's
[2734.80 - 2738.60] actually less expensive you got the 8 O
[2736.92 - 2740.16] than so many of the brands out there
[2738.60 - 2742.12] it's incredible it's a massive bottle
[2740.16 - 2744.60] I'm holding in my hand this is an 8 O
[2742.12 - 2746.20] bottle I'm holding right here the refill
[2744.60 - 2748.96] bottle which is incredible and saves you
[2746.20 - 2752.76] money too so all right that's total
[2748.96 - 2755.28] immune this is what I do propolis goes
[2752.76 - 2759.36] in there total immune goes in there
[2755.28 - 2762.44] golden seal goes in there okay boom just
[2759.36 - 2765.92] pop that in there
[2762.44 - 2768.12] okay Dr fun other brands of golden seal
[2765.92 - 2771.32] really taste crappy because they're
[2768.12 - 2774.88] burnt and there's additives that are not
[2771.32 - 2778.24] listed in the ingredient list that's why
[2774.88 - 2780.88] big difference I'm going to pop little
[2778.24 - 2782.32] bit of zinc in here extra zinc it's a
[2780.88 - 2783.52] little touch of zinc in the total immune
[2782.32 - 2787.84] but I'm going to put a little bit of
[2783.52 - 2790.24] extra zinc over there too so yeah yeah
[2787.84 - 2792.40] Victoria rising from the ashes the vimer
[2790.24 - 2794.88] golden seal tastes so much better and is
[2792.40 - 2797.04] so much lighter colored than the
[2794.88 - 2798.96] previous medical medium preferred Brands
[2797.04 - 2800.60] before vimergy started making gold seal
[2798.96 - 2805.00] I just want to explain that there's a
[2800.60 - 2807.04] reason why the brands that are previous
[2805.00 - 2811.28] Brands and the brands out there they
[2807.04 - 2813.36] burn it it makes it darker but doesn't
[2811.28 - 2816.40] mean it's stronger do you understand
[2813.36 - 2818.44] that it okay and it doesn't mean also
[2816.40 - 2821.00] that other Brands out there that barely
[2818.44 - 2823.64] put any in and it's really light doesn't
[2821.00 - 2825.92] mean that's stronger either okay but
[2823.64 - 2828.28] there's not and the quality is not there
[2825.92 - 2830.88] like the golden seal from vimer it's a
[2828.28 - 2834.32] whole another story quality is not there
[2830.88 - 2836.12] like that and yeah it does tastes good
[2834.32 - 2840.24] and it tastes like golden seal though
[2836.12 - 2842.68] don't let me don't let me um dress that
[2840.24 - 2845.76] up too great golden seals tastes God
[2842.68 - 2847.36] awful tried them all out there this one
[2845.76 - 2849.04] tastes like golden seal
[2847.36 - 2850.56] but it tastes better which is incredible
[2849.04 - 2852.64] so you got the total immune got the
[2850.56 - 2855.80] golden seal got the
[2852.64 - 2858.24] propolis I got the Elderberry I can put
[2855.80 - 2862.72] that in there
[2858.24 - 2864.56] too crazy that kind of concentration
[2862.72 - 2867.88] seven times more potent on the
[2864.56 - 2870.16] Elderberry that is incredible I'm going
[2867.88 - 2871.80] to add a little water if you don't mind
[2870.16 - 2873.72] little bit of water I got a glass of
[2871.80 - 2875.48] water here I'm going to just kind of add
[2873.72 - 2878.12] that there
[2875.48 - 2880.84] amazing okay wondering wishing says

[3215.24 - 3221.84] golden seal yes exactly you're looking
[3218.44 - 3225.24] at the time and the Mullen lung lung
[3221.84 - 3227.28] lung respiratory respiratory respiratory
[3225.24 - 3230.68] right and the zinc in there then you're
[3227.28 - 3233.36] talking about the prois pure oral health
[3230.68 - 3235.56] oral health so many people with oral
[3233.36 - 3236.96] everybody's like clove oil clove oil
[3235.56 - 3238.84] everybody's like yeah yeah you got a
[3236.96 - 3243.56] problem in your mouth clove oil clove
[3238.84 - 3245.48] oil clove oil uh propolis propolis

[3263.72 - 3269.88] compared to propolis pure that is an
[3266.84 - 3271.64] absolute joke compared to propolis pure
[3269.88 - 3275.84] same thing like oil pulling oral health
[3271.64 - 3278.36] oil pulling propolis for oral health
[3275.84 - 3280.60] that's another level there's another
[3278.36 - 3282.44] level right like the fast food
[3280.60 - 3286.28] restaurants I've said this over and over
[3282.44 - 3289.76] again okay all right it's like years ago
[3286.28 - 3292.16] I said this right you got McDonald's
[3289.76 - 3294.00] right yeah remember I said this before
[3292.16 - 3296.84] then you got Burger King Burger King
[3294.00 - 3299.84] flame broils right they took things like
[3296.84 - 3301.88] to another level they flame broiled and
[3299.84 - 3305.60] then you got like Arby's they offer more
[3301.88 - 3308.16] lettuce on their burgers then you got
[3305.60 - 3311.52] then you it keeps on going up right then
[3308.16 - 3313.08] you got what you got Taco Bell they're
[3311.52 - 3315.00] putting all these different vegetables
[3313.08 - 3316.80] now in their rollups then you got and it
[3315.00 - 3319.32] keeps on going then you got Olive Garden
[3316.80 - 3321.72] they got big salad bars then it keeps on
[3319.32 - 3323.44] whatever it is keeps on going up right
[3321.72 - 3325.52] and it goes up it goes up then it goes
[3323.44 - 3327.52] up from there then it goes up from there
[3325.52 - 3329.32] then it goes up to no processed foods
[3327.52 - 3331.84] then it goes up to this level then that
[3329.32 - 3334.20] level next you know no Troublemaker
[3331.84 - 3336.60] foods you can keep like the medical me
[3334.20 - 3340.52] information and you can go up higher and
[3336.60 - 3344.12] higher and higher and higher and you can
[3340.52 - 3346.80] get up here is what you can do you can
[3344.12 - 3348.24] start from down here and you can get to
[3346.80 - 3351.48] up
[3348.24 - 3354.84] here and that's what's happening when
[3351.48 - 3358.68] you actually use the right stuff you're
[3354.84 - 3361.24] going from there to up
[3358.68 - 3363.60] here so immune system we'll get into it
[3361.24 - 3365.48] a little bit immune cells are
[3363.60 - 3369.88] hungry
[3365.48 - 3372.04] desperate immune cells can be desperate
[3369.88 - 3373.32] okay sometimes there's people they're so
[3372.04 - 3375.40] beaten down they don't feel good they
[3373.32 - 3378.00] have so many symptoms they have that
[3375.40 - 3381.84] despera livity they have that like that
[3378.00 - 3384.68] feeling in that that that look they have
[3381.84 - 3386.72] been through hell right they've been
[3384.68 - 3389.12] beaten down and their immune system
[3386.72 - 3391.08] shows through like their immune system
[3389.12 - 3393.20] is showing through it's showing through
[3391.08 - 3395.32] their skin it's showing through their
[3393.20 - 3397.76] eyes it's showing through their tongue
[3395.32 - 3402.00] it's showing right and and their immune
[3397.76 - 3403.84] cells are desperate for fuel so they can
[3402.00 - 3406.56] strike a
[3403.84 - 3408.88] balance so they can strike a balance so
[3406.56 - 3410.28] what happens with our immune system is
[3408.88 - 3413.04] our immune system is trying to
[3410.28 - 3415.48] constantly balance out the bad the
[3413.04 - 3417.48] immune system is gobbling down garbage
[3415.48 - 3420.40] and junk
[3417.48 - 3423.24] immune cells are gobbling up radiation
[3420.40 - 3425.48] particles immune cells eat radiation
[3423.24 - 3428.68] particles that's how it works so keep
[3425.48 - 3432.00] that in mind if you got a particle of
[3428.68 - 3434.56] radiation and it somehow gets into you
[3432.00 - 3436.68] someway somehow your immune cells come
[3434.56 - 3439.12] by and they gobble it up that's the
[3436.68 - 3441.44] whole point if something goes into your
[3439.12 - 3443.68] lung that's toxic and not good like
[3441.44 - 3444.92] chemrail stuff is dropping out and
[3443.68 - 3446.84] you're and it's in your lung you're
[3444.92 - 3449.00] breathing it in you're immune cells in
[3446.84 - 3451.08] your lung are actually trying to gobble
[3449.00 - 3453.64] that up before it even gets deep into
[3451.08 - 3455.32] your bloodstream into your brain so you
[3453.64 - 3457.84] got immune cells that are like going
[3455.32 - 3460.64] into your lungs at the base of the lungs
[3457.84 - 3463.16] right there little
[3460.64 - 3464.96] pockets and they're actually all around
[3463.16 - 3467.08] there around the lymphatic system and so
[3464.96 - 3469.48] forth all around the lungs and they're
[3467.08 - 3471.96] there to gobble up any kind of radiation
[3469.48 - 3473.76] particles and so forth chemtrail
[3471.96 - 3476.56] particles coming down your immune cells
[3473.76 - 3479.92] are trying to gobble up all of that that
[3476.56 - 3482.04] gets into your lungs right there okay
[3479.92 - 3485.08] the flu goes down into your lungs you
[3482.04 - 3487.16] breathe it in boom that's right your
[3485.08 - 3491.12] immune cells are trying to get every
[3487.16 - 3493.72] single little flu viral particle right
[3491.12 - 3495.64] cell flu viral cell your immune system
[3493.72 - 3498.08] is working hard but then your immune
[3495.64 - 3500.32] cells get hungry how weak are they do
[3498.08 - 3504.12] they have zinc in them are your immune
[3500.32 - 3506.72] cells low on zinc is that happening or
[3504.12 - 3509.40] your immune cells low on something thing
[3506.72 - 3510.92] what is not feeding your immune cells
[3509.40 - 3514.12] now we got to get what we can through
[3510.92 - 3516.84] foods but this world has changed man I
[3514.12 - 3520.52] run to people and I I respect that
[3516.84 - 3522.76] because I believe you can heal so much
[3520.52 - 3526.24] with Foods right but there's that one
[3522.76 - 3528.96] person that that they need support
[3526.24 - 3532.72] Beyond food because they're not doing
[3528.96 - 3535.20] the foods right or enough of the foods
[3532.72 - 3537.48] think about it it's hard right hard to
[3535.20 - 3539.76] eat the way you need to eat it's hard to
[3537.48 - 3542.16] take care of yourself a lot of different
[3539.76 - 3544.36] ways a lot of people they struggle with
[3542.16 - 3546.08] that and the stress and then they'll
[3544.36 - 3547.92] emotionally eat then they'll eat
[3546.08 - 3549.68] whatever some comfort Foods where
[3547.92 - 3551.44] emotionally they can push to their Max
[3549.68 - 3552.92] and their brain is about to explode so
[3551.44 - 3555.32] they end up eating something that's like
[3552.92 - 3556.56] a vice or something that's H right
[3555.32 - 3557.52] something that's in front of them they
[3556.56 - 3559.88] gobble
[3557.52 - 3562.44] down it's hard to do everything through
[3559.88 - 3564.20] food when you can't keep the foods
[3562.44 - 3565.56] really good that's a whole problem all
[3564.20 - 3567.32] on its own that's what I mean I believe
[3565.56 - 3569.44] you can deal so much with foods but
[3567.32 - 3570.72] people they have a hard time you guys
[3569.44 - 3572.72] know you see it out there a hard time
[3570.72 - 3574.52] with doing the foods so we need some
[3572.72 - 3576.80] other things too and some people need
[3574.52 - 3579.48] food and they need the
[3576.80 - 3585.76] supplementation see Andre over there on
[3579.48 - 3586.96] IG says and what about zinc oh yeah well
[3585.76 - 3588.92] all right so here's what I love right
[3586.96 - 3590.92] there's zinc in the total immune right
[3588.92 - 3593.72] there so there is zinc in the total
[3590.92 - 3596.60] immune there's
[3593.72 - 3600.56] thyme Mullen
[3596.60 - 3602.40] and zinc in the total immune okay not as
[3600.56 - 3604.00] much as you're taking extra zinc like
[3602.40 - 3605.88] what I'll do is I'll take extra zinc
[3604.00 - 3609.52] I'll take
[3605.88 - 3613.68] okay so what I'll do is take some zinc
[3609.52 - 3616.68] right there you go put some zinc there
[3613.68 - 3616.68] and I'll take a total
[3617.04 - 3622.28] immune as
[3619.00 - 3624.92] well do a total immune in there and I'll
[3622.28 - 3627.60] take a golden seal and a propolis so I
[3624.92 - 3630.92] just threw extra zinc in in
[3627.60 - 3632.72] there right I'm going to do some golden
[3630.92 - 3636.24] seal
[3632.72 - 3639.88] right all right
[3636.24 - 3642.12] so I added zinc to it because you zinc
[3639.88 - 3645.08] deficiencies are rampant out there okay
[3642.12 - 3648.96] so science is saying that men need to
[3645.08 - 3650.88] have sex 21 times a month in order to
[3648.96 - 3653.92] keep their prostate healthy so they
[3650.88 - 3656.60] don't get prostate cancer so science
[3653.92 - 3659.16] just came out with a study there really
[3656.60 - 3662.16] was no study there when you look at
[3659.16 - 3663.76] it scientist came out some that said men
[3662.16 - 3668.72] have to have
[3663.76 - 3670.36] sex 21 times a month every single month
[3668.72 - 3671.92] or they're they're going to be risking
[3670.36 - 3676.00] prostate
[3671.92 - 3679.04] cancer okay well if a guy is having sex
[3676.00 - 3681.88] 21 times a month a guy most likely is
[3679.04 - 3684.68] not being too
[3681.88 - 3687.16] productive otherwise in their life or
[3684.68 - 3690.88] work that's where for
[3687.16 - 3694.24] sure pretty much that's a great way to
[3690.88 - 3698.08] probably destroy a guy's adrenals over
[3694.24 - 3703.24] time if it's 21 times a month without
[3698.08 - 3707.32] fail not five times a month or 10 but 21
[3703.24 - 3711.24] science says okay now if a man is having
[3707.32 - 3716.24] sex 21 times a month they have no
[3711.24 - 3722.20] zinc no zinc it is gone
[3716.24 - 3725.92] gone gone like gone bye see you
[3722.20 - 3727.40] later okay so if a man is having sex
[3725.92 - 3729.96] five times a
[3727.40 - 3733.68] month their zinc is
[3729.96 - 3736.80] gone yep gone unless they're bringing
[3733.68 - 3740.00] zinc in so what happens is science is
[3736.80 - 3742.52] saying to protect the man from prostate
[3740.00 - 3745.48] cancer they need to be having sex 21
[3742.52 - 3747.44] times a month but when you think about
[3745.48 - 3751.56] that that means they have no zinc
[3747.44 - 3755.04] anymore guess what protects you right
[3751.56 - 3757.80] your immune system protects you from all
[3755.04 - 3760.44] kinds of problems like that but then you
[3757.80 - 3763.00] you lose your immune system if a man's
[3760.44 - 3766.28] doing that 21 times a
[3763.00 - 3768.60] month because they're releasing all
[3766.28 - 3771.68] their zinc they're releasing all of
[3768.60 - 3774.92] their reserves because they're trying to
[3771.68 - 3776.48] spread seed right that's what they're
[3774.92 - 3779.00] doing they're trying to spread seed on
[3776.48 - 3781.08] the planet so they're throwing all of
[3779.00 - 3784.12] their phytochemical compounds immune
[3781.08 - 3785.80] supporting nutrients and zinc and b12
[3784.12 - 3787.68] and everything else goes out the door
[3785.80 - 3789.12] it's gone but science says that's just
[3787.68 - 3790.52] great because it'll stop you from
[3789.12 - 3793.04] getting prostate cancer but this is the
[3790.52 - 3795.16] kind of ridiculous crap you see every
[3793.04 - 3798.12] day out there all the
[3795.16 - 3800.36] time just like science now says even
[3798.12 - 3803.76] though they have no study for it that if
[3800.36 - 3807.56] you pair a tomato
[3803.76 - 3809.20] with if you pair a tomato with
[3807.56 - 3811.28] avocado you're going to get the
[3809.20 - 3813.40] lycopenes much better and you're going
[3811.28 - 3814.92] to Stave off cancer you're going to
[3813.40 - 3818.00] saave something off because you're
[3814.92 - 3820.32] eating your tomato with your avocado so
[3818.00 - 3822.40] science now says whoa just don't have
[3820.32 - 3824.24] like tomato have your tomato with
[3822.40 - 3827.16] avocado first of all science was saying
[3824.24 - 3829.04] back I don't know 20 years ago 15 years
[3827.16 - 3830.76] ago that no one's allowed to eat a
[3829.04 - 3832.64] tomato because it was going to kill you
[3830.76 - 3834.24] because it was the nightshade family and
[3832.64 - 3837.20] no one was even allowed to so science
[3834.24 - 3839.12] was saying stay away from tomato
[3837.20 - 3841.00] because they're going to hurt you and
[3839.12 - 3843.36] give you arthritis because they're a
[3841.00 - 3845.92] Nightshade you know member of the family
[3843.36 - 3848.36] now science is saying if you pair a
[3845.92 - 3850.28] tomato with avocado you can save off
[3848.36 - 3852.84] cancer or anything else because it makes
[3850.28 - 3857.20] the lopine so much stronger which is not
[3852.84 - 3860.00] true when you put a lopine or a nutrient
[3857.20 - 3863.40] with fat and you have it enter your
[3860.00 - 3865.04] bloodstream it won't enter cells the
[3863.40 - 3867.00] fats enter your bloodstream and they
[3865.04 - 3869.16] inhibit new nutrients like lopine from
[3867.00 - 3870.88] ever entering cells so easily so you
[3869.16 - 3873.12] only get a fraction of that tomatoes
[3870.88 - 3875.28] lopine because you actually have so much
[3873.12 - 3877.36] fat in your system so science is wrong
[3875.28 - 3879.68] again science is wrong wrong wrong wrong
[3877.36 - 3881.40] wrong that's how it works there so
[3879.68 - 3884.04] they're telling people you you get more
[3881.40 - 3885.92] lopine that to actually save off cancer
[3884.04 - 3887.84] protect you from cancer when you have it
[3885.92 - 3890.04] with avocado but when you have it with
[3887.84 - 3892.08] fat you don't get the lopine another
[3890.04 - 3894.28] place science is wrong once again too
[3892.08 - 3896.28] they're saying don't have berries and
[3894.28 - 3898.12] antioxidants with your banan cuz your
[3896.28 - 3899.92] bananas inhibited that's not true cuz
[3898.12 - 3902.36] they don't have a study to show that's
[3899.92 - 3904.28] actually accurate or anything exists but
[3902.36 - 3906.60] there's always been an attack on bananas
[3904.28 - 3909.44] because bananas actually help people
[3906.60 - 3911.00] from guess what diabetes and
[3909.44 - 3912.24] pre-diabetes and everything else and
[3911.00 - 3914.32] they've been trying to keep people off
[3912.24 - 3916.84] of bananas to make sure people go on
[3914.32 - 3919.24] lots of medications like metformin and
[3916.84 - 3923.12] so forth it's just crazy how it
[3919.24 - 3925.92] works I talk about infertility of not
[3923.12 - 3928.60] just women but infertility also of about
[3925.92 - 3931.12] men too and how that works and I've
[3928.60 - 3932.96] talked about that for years you know so
[3931.12 - 3934.60] in life-changing Foods book you'll see
[3932.96 - 3936.56] that I talk about infertility with men
[3934.60 - 3939.36] and everything else in there CU I saw
[3936.56 - 3939.36] somebody ask about
[3939.64 - 3944.76] that
[3941.32 - 3946.60] yeah so the bottom line is you'll see a
[3944.76 - 3949.28] lot of silly things out there over and
[3946.60 - 3951.16] over again another another really
[3949.28 - 3953.44] ridiculous thing that's out there now if
[3951.16 - 3955.64] you drink your tea too hot you're going
[3953.44 - 3957.08] to get cancer that's the dumbest thing
[3955.64 - 3959.36] thing they've ever said because they
[3957.08 - 3962.28] said if you're scolding your esophagus
[3959.36 - 3965.44] first of all in order to scold your
[3962.28 - 3968.04] esophagus to that level you need to be
[3965.44 - 3969.48] putting it down burning hot and you're
[3968.04 - 3971.24] still not going to get cancer just
[3969.48 - 3973.68] because you scold your you know you're
[3971.24 - 3975.64] you're scolding your scalding your
[3973.68 - 3978.04] esophagus whatever so it's crazy how it
[3975.64 - 3979.92] works so I see this all the time the
[3978.04 - 3983.60] different the different stuff they're
[3979.92 - 3986.24] putting out there is nuts so back to
[3983.60 - 3988.36] zinc zinc is critical because yeah
[3986.24 - 3991.52] because science is actually trying to
[3988.36 - 3994.04] push people to lose their zinc reserves
[3991.52 - 3996.44] men and women in all all kinds of
[3994.04 - 3998.64] different ways out there so zinc
[3996.44 - 4001.16] deficiencies are really rampant because
[3998.64 - 4003.32] we can't get enough zinc as it is so
[4001.16 - 4005.60] another thing is people are saying don't
[4003.32 - 4008.96] take zinc because zinc you know
[4005.60 - 4011.16] minimizes your copper well we crushed
[4008.96 - 4015.80] that in the past because that's not how
[4011.16 - 4018.12] it works because copper is so so easy to
[4015.80 - 4020.24] have in your system everybody is
[4018.12 - 4022.64] overloaded with copper we have too much
[4020.24 - 4026.00] copper so when you take copper
[4022.64 - 4029.64] supplements you're pushing yourself into
[4026.00 - 4032.08] copper poisoning when you take copper
[4029.64 - 4033.16] based supplements so you'll see out
[4032.08 - 4035.80] there people are like oh you're going to
[4033.16 - 4038.64] get a copper deficiency if you take zinc
[4035.80 - 4041.72] But the irony is no one's copper
[4038.64 - 4044.72] deficient you can't be copper it's
[4041.72 - 4046.40] impossible to be copper deficient we
[4044.72 - 4049.12] have so much copper Copper at our
[4046.40 - 4051.20] fingertips every minute avocados are
[4049.12 - 4053.28] high in Copper everything is high in
[4051.20 - 4057.08] copper copper is actually saturated in
[4053.28 - 4059.64] the soils all organic farm soil has
[4057.08 - 4062.92] copper in it all fruits and vegetables
[4059.64 - 4065.72] herbs nuts seeds people eat all copper
[4062.92 - 4067.56] in it right so copper is really high and
[4065.72 - 4069.68] then people get sick from an in
[4067.56 - 4071.84] inundation of copper both toxic coppers
[4069.68 - 4074.08] and coppers that come from food so what
[4071.84 - 4076.08] happens is they have this copper level
[4074.08 - 4077.80] up to here it gets to the brain their
[4076.08 - 4081.04] brain gets filled with copper and then
[4077.80 - 4082.84] they can't talk right eventually they
[4081.04 - 4084.36] start having problems with their memory
[4082.84 - 4088.92] they start having all kinds of different
[4084.36 - 4092.40] issues copper is one of the culprits to
[4088.92 - 4094.44] why people are sick but yet zinc
[4092.40 - 4097.32] deficiencies are one of the other
[4094.44 - 4100.08] culprits to why people are sick zinc
[4097.32 - 4102.64] deficiencies and then copper being
[4100.08 - 4104.80] overloaded so when anybody's like oh I
[4102.64 - 4106.28] want to take a little zinc cuz they
[4104.80 - 4107.60] desperately need their immune system
[4106.28 - 4109.36] desperately needs it they need it to
[4107.60 - 4110.60] heal they want to take a little zinc and
[4109.36 - 4112.12] then someone comes along and says oh
[4110.60 - 4114.40] don't take zinc it's going to get give
[4112.12 - 4116.12] you a copper problem it's like that's
[4114.40 - 4117.64] insane all its own so I'm just covering
[4116.12 - 4119.00] a couple of the myths that are out there
[4117.64 - 4121.64] just a few things quick reminder if
[4119.00 - 4123.64] you're signed up for the September 7th

[4226.52 - 4231.40] going to be the bottle filled with
[4228.08 - 4233.32] freshly made literally just probably an
[4231.40 - 4235.68] hour before of the heavy metal detox
[4233.32 - 4237.44] smoothie right in that bottle so I'm
[4235.68 - 4239.72] excited about that you guys back to the
[4237.44 - 4241.28] immune system protecting our immune
[4239.72 - 4243.76] system is critical just want to let
[4241.28 - 4246.68] everybody know our immune system is is
[4243.76 - 4249.52] inside of our liver it's there every day
[4246.68 - 4251.88] preventing people from getting hepatitis
[4249.52 - 4255.00] C which is the low grade viral
[4251.88 - 4257.04] infections you know hepatitis in general
[4255.00 - 4258.88] in your immune systems in your liver
[4257.04 - 4260.44] your immune systems in your pancreas
[4258.88 - 4263.64] trying to prevent you from getting
[4260.44 - 4265.20] pancreatic tumors pancreatic cysts so
[4263.64 - 4267.64] your immune system is all around your
[4265.20 - 4270.00] pancreas and in your pancreas your
[4267.64 - 4271.68] immune system obviously your spleen
[4270.00 - 4274.04] right you know that your immune system
[4271.68 - 4276.56] is in your gut but not even a fraction
[4274.04 - 4278.16] of what it is in your lymphatic system
[4276.56 - 4280.64] throughout your body and in your
[4278.16 - 4282.76] bloodstream so your immune system mostly
[4280.64 - 4284.08] is in the bloodstream though to protect
[4282.76 - 4286.40] you that's the whole point if your
[4284.08 - 4288.52] immune system isn't in your bloodstream
[4286.40 - 4290.64] then we would be in big trouble so our
[4288.52 - 4292.32] bone marrows producing overdrive
[4290.64 - 4293.92] everybody's immune cells to try to
[4292.32 - 4296.20] battle everything out of the Sun from
[4293.92 - 4298.04] stealth bugs to bugs that they're just
[4296.20 - 4300.08] spilling at every day and Manufacturing
[4298.04 - 4302.28] and putting out on us whatever it is
[4300.08 - 4304.32] that we're up against okay your bone
[4302.28 - 4307.40] marrows sitting there producing immune
[4304.32 - 4309.28] cells every day to help you get strong I
[4307.40 - 4311.00] talked about the blood draws right we
[4309.28 - 4312.32] can go into that another day you know
[4311.00 - 4313.96] what you have to look out for that but
[4312.32 - 4315.56] either way your immune system is
[4313.96 - 4317.84] floating around your bloodstream to
[4315.56 - 4320.32] protect your brain and protect other
[4317.84 - 4322.80] organs and protect your skin and
[4320.32 - 4326.36] everything else and it's just there and
