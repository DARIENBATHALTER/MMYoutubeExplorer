[293.36 - 297.04] every single day i'll do a shot with a
[295.20 - 297.92] shot glass two on shot glass it's

[314.24 - 317.92] so and why is that like why are they
[317.04 - 320.40] doing that

[320.40 - 324.16] they been doing this since before 1920
[322.64 - 326.40] why do they do that
[324.16 - 328.56] melissa people were really sticking up
[326.40 - 331.04] for eggs on your recent crazy egg
[328.56 - 331.60] oh my god they want to slaughter me they

[355.28 - 357.52] right
[355.92 - 359.12] but i get it i mean a lot of people eat
[357.52 - 361.44] the eggs and
[359.12 - 362.96] but whoa did people get upset they
[361.44 - 364.24] really got upset because it's not good
[362.96 - 365.68] to eat them if you
[364.24 - 366.96] if you're dealing with conditions and
[365.68 - 369.04] i'm going to talk about that you ordered

[385.68 - 390.40] it's a medicine it's potent it's strong

[392.08 - 396.56] and and it's like you know it's better
[394.64 - 399.84] than any fine wine that's for sure

[698.72 - 703.84] better start now
[700.08 - 703.84] all right thanks so much
[704.32 - 707.76] all right anyway you guys the bottom
[706.64 - 709.76] line is yeah
[707.76 - 712.40] of course there's vitamins and chicken
[709.76 - 715.44] poop there's vitamins and chicken poop
[712.40 - 718.08] there's vitamins and humans human feces
[715.44 - 718.80] so when you do a poop there's nutrients
[718.08 - 721.36] in there
[718.80 - 722.08] there's vitamins and nutrients in your
[721.36 - 725.52] poo
[722.08 - 727.60] right well better start eating
[725.52 - 729.52] better start eating some poo better
[727.60 - 731.92] straining it right now
[729.52 - 734.08] i got some poo in here i better start
[731.92 - 737.20] eating where's my fork
[734.08 - 738.72] well you can test poo and poo has all
[737.20 - 740.48] these nutrients in it
[738.72 - 742.24] people's poo has lots of nutrients in
[740.48 - 743.28] there i better start eating this poo
[742.24 - 746.00] right here because
[743.28 - 747.12] there's nutrients in here this poo is
[746.00 - 751.60] really good
[747.12 - 754.72] it really is you guys have to understand
[751.60 - 756.32] sherry dr sherry green
[754.72 - 757.76] good good i'm glad you're here an
[756.32 - 759.28] amazing medical doctor
[757.76 - 761.12] so what happens is yeah there's
[759.28 - 762.24] something good in eggs of course there
[761.12 - 764.16] is right
[762.24 - 765.84] but guess what there's something better
[764.16 - 768.96] for you in spinach
[765.84 - 772.00] don't eat the raw spinach god forbid
[768.96 - 774.48] don't eat spinach but make sure you
[772.00 - 775.52] eat lots of eggs that's where the b
[774.48 - 778.80] vitamins
[775.52 - 780.80] really are really are and by the way i
[778.80 - 782.72] hate to break anybody's heart
[780.80 - 784.24] but the b vitamins and eggs don't
[782.72 - 787.76] convert to human
[784.24 - 790.16] use they don't convert i talked about it
[787.76 - 792.16] on the podcast the egg podcast episode
[790.16 - 794.24] the chicken the chicken's body isn't
[792.16 - 795.36] like i'm gonna produce a whole bunch of
[794.24 - 797.60] vitamin b's for
[795.36 - 798.96] for humans to eat me the vitamin b's
[797.60 - 802.56] don't convert by your liver
[798.96 - 804.56] you can't convert the bees in eggs you
[802.56 - 806.16] can't
[804.56 - 807.60] you guys are we going to take today's
[806.16 - 809.28] more serious
[807.60 - 810.80] because i got to make some food and talk
[809.28 - 814.00] about some things too
[810.80 - 816.32] um anyway all right you guys
[814.00 - 818.24] i got some tomatoes i got some oranges i
[816.32 - 819.04] got some lemons i got some spinach some
[818.24 - 820.80] cilantro
[819.04 - 822.80] i got potatoes here if you're an animal
[820.80 - 824.88] protein person you can add animal
[822.80 - 826.72] protein to your salad if that's what you
[824.88 - 828.08] really want but i try to keep the fats
[826.72 - 829.60] low because guess what
[828.08 - 831.36] you're always going to be eating fats i
[829.60 - 832.00] can't stop you guys if i was a fly on
[831.36 - 833.92] the wall
[832.00 - 835.76] if i was a fly on the wall i'd be
[833.92 - 838.00] watching you guys eat all this fat
[835.76 - 839.28] well i'm going to have more nut butters
[838.00 - 841.76] going to have more oil
[839.28 - 843.60] going to have more avocados i'm gonna
[841.76 - 845.12] have more chicken gonna have more beef
[843.60 - 847.52] gonna have some cheese
[845.12 - 848.56] gonna have some eggs too right if i was
[847.52 - 850.16] a fly in the wall
[848.56 - 851.60] i'd be watching all that i'd be left
[850.16 - 853.52] there going hey
[851.60 - 855.60] those guys are eating so much fat it's
[853.52 - 857.36] unbelievable so that's why i want you
[855.60 - 859.28] guys to actually you know be a little
[857.36 - 862.16] bit low fat if you can
[859.28 - 864.00] um ddd i finally feel like um i lost a
[862.16 - 867.20] comment it went flying up
[864.00 - 869.28] i finally feel like i'm hearing the food
[867.20 - 870.32] truth for the first time needy i'm
[869.28 - 873.20] honored you're here
[870.32 - 874.96] incredible thank you for being here okay
[873.20 - 877.04] see you guys
[874.96 - 878.48] all right let's talk about a little bit
[877.04 - 881.20] so how
[878.48 - 882.32] viruses work well you're going to hear
[881.20 - 885.36] out there that
[882.32 - 885.92] bugs like viruses are dead they're just
[885.36 - 889.68] these
[885.92 - 893.36] strands these rna strands or
[889.68 - 895.28] they're just an essence in our system
[893.36 - 898.24] that bugs are dead we'll tell that to
[895.28 - 900.48] somebody with simplex one who doesn't
[898.24 - 901.84] somebody with simplex one okay when you
[900.48 - 905.12] get the fever blister
[901.84 - 907.44] right you go you go kissing somebody
[905.12 - 908.56] with that fever blister guess what's
[907.44 - 912.88] gonna happen
[908.56 - 914.72] that virus is alive that virus is alive
[912.88 - 916.00] and when you go kissing somebody and
[914.72 - 919.12] they kiss you
[916.00 - 921.36] uh they're gonna have that virus
[919.12 - 922.32] that's how it works okay viruses are
[921.36 - 924.64] alive
[922.32 - 926.56] they're not dead but it's about snowing
[924.64 - 928.56] people let smoke and mirror
[926.56 - 930.64] let's snow the heck out of people let's
[928.56 - 932.56] know them snow them snow them
[930.64 - 934.00] and that's what they do out there say
[932.56 - 937.12] viruses aren't alive
[934.00 - 941.20] that's why with the flu virus if you
[937.12 - 944.52] sneeze the virus comes out of you
[941.20 - 948.48] and it lands on a table it
[944.52 - 949.04] eventually dies okay it eventually dies
[948.48 - 951.36] it's
[949.04 - 954.00] it's away from if it's on the table on a
[951.36 - 956.80] counter it's a way for moisture
[954.00 - 957.36] it can't get the moisture it needs to
[956.80 - 960.48] stay
[957.36 - 962.96] alive okay it can't eat
[960.48 - 965.04] it can't what happens is oxygen touches
[962.96 - 968.40] it so here's how viruses work
[965.04 - 972.48] oxygen keeps them down
[968.40 - 976.32] oxygen direct oxygen kills viruses right
[972.48 - 978.80] kills bugs kills pathogens direct
[976.32 - 980.16] oxygen right our bloodstream is in
[978.80 - 983.60] direct oxygen
[980.16 - 984.64] okay it's not it's not filled with
[983.60 - 988.00] oxygen it's
[984.64 - 991.36] partially filled with oxygen
[988.00 - 994.16] not it's not enough to kill off the bugs
[991.36 - 996.08] the oxygen we breathe as it goes into
[994.16 - 999.20] our lungs and into our bloodstream
[996.08 - 1001.44] okay and the reason why
[999.20 - 1002.88] bugs really thrive too is we're eating
[1001.44 - 1006.00] so much fat
[1002.88 - 1006.32] we're eating so much fat the more fat
[1006.00 - 1009.92] you
[1006.32 - 1011.04] eat right okay the thicker your blood
[1009.92 - 1014.00] gets and the less
[1011.04 - 1015.20] oxygen is in your blood that's how it
[1014.00 - 1018.64] works
[1015.20 - 1019.76] so then viruses right proliferate that
[1018.64 - 1022.80] they grow
[1019.76 - 1023.60] they explode they expand they grow in
[1022.80 - 1025.36] numbers
[1023.60 - 1026.56] so then the viruses grow in numbers the
[1025.36 - 1027.92] next thing you know you got another
[1026.56 - 1030.40] virus i lost all the
[1027.92 - 1031.52] little bugs i had around here but next
[1030.40 - 1033.60] thing you got two
[1031.52 - 1034.72] and then you got three and that's how
[1033.60 - 1038.00] they work
[1034.72 - 1041.36] um but the bottom line is
[1038.00 - 1044.56] viruses multiply as the oxygen
[1041.36 - 1045.68] levels drop a little bit in your
[1044.56 - 1049.28] bloodstream
[1045.68 - 1050.48] okay it's it's on a very very tight
[1049.28 - 1054.00] scale
[1050.48 - 1056.80] but it drops viruses like to hide in
[1054.00 - 1059.20] fat they love to hide in your blood they
[1056.80 - 1062.80] like to hide in fat so if a virus
[1059.20 - 1065.28] is in the blood it likes high fat if
[1062.80 - 1067.36] if your liver starts to get fatty it
[1065.28 - 1069.60] likes to hide in the liver and all that
[1067.36 - 1070.80] fat that's what viruses like to do
[1069.60 - 1074.88] because the more
[1070.80 - 1076.48] fatty your liver gets the more bugs can
[1074.88 - 1076.96] thrive in your liver because there's
[1076.48 - 1079.28] less
[1076.96 - 1080.96] oxygen in a stagnant sluggish liver and
[1079.28 - 1083.20] that's the breeding ground
[1080.96 - 1085.12] for viruses the breeding ground for
[1083.20 - 1088.08] viruses is the liver
[1085.12 - 1089.76] and the liver loses oxygen even if your
[1088.08 - 1090.40] bloodstream has a decent amount of
[1089.76 - 1093.76] oxygen
[1090.40 - 1095.20] your liver okay your liver can get all
[1093.76 - 1097.60] stagnant sluggish and
[1095.20 - 1098.80] fatty and the oxygen levels in the liver
[1097.60 - 1101.04] decrease
[1098.80 - 1102.80] so the viruses thrive and they gain
[1101.04 - 1105.52] strength in numbers
[1102.80 - 1107.36] that's how that works and then when
[1105.52 - 1110.00] you're eating something like eggs
[1107.36 - 1111.28] you're feeding the virus so let's talk
[1110.00 - 1112.40] about that for a second if you guys just
[1111.28 - 1114.88] came on
[1112.40 - 1116.24] spinach cilantro gonna make food gonna
[1114.88 - 1120.16] make a salad in a minute
[1116.24 - 1124.16] um talking about some cool stuff here so
[1120.16 - 1127.68] why do viruses
[1124.16 - 1132.40] feed on eggs when they
[1127.68 - 1135.84] don't feed on meat
[1132.40 - 1136.40] they don't feed on meat why do they feed
[1135.84 - 1139.60] on
[1136.40 - 1140.20] eggs they feed on eggs because eggs are
[1139.60 - 1143.48] an
[1140.20 - 1146.64] underdeveloped protein
[1143.48 - 1151.44] underdeveloped the other thing is
[1146.64 - 1154.08] an egg does not have an immune system
[1151.44 - 1155.84] so if you saw the video right that
[1154.08 - 1157.68] michelle was talking about not the egg
[1155.84 - 1159.60] thing again if you saw the tick tock
[1157.68 - 1162.72] video right you guys
[1159.60 - 1164.00] well those eggs had the top of the egg
[1162.72 - 1167.52] was cut off
[1164.00 - 1170.00] in the tick tock video and then i had
[1167.52 - 1171.28] i had a syringe right this is this is
[1170.00 - 1172.88] really just for talking about the blood
[1171.28 - 1176.00] draw but i had a syringe
[1172.88 - 1177.44] and i was putting in some viruses into
[1176.00 - 1181.44] the tops of the eggs
[1177.44 - 1184.56] during that video and viruses can thrive
[1181.44 - 1187.76] in a living egg a raw egg
[1184.56 - 1190.48] can thrive and grow in numbers because
[1187.76 - 1192.00] there's no immune system in the in that
[1190.48 - 1195.28] raw egg
[1192.00 - 1197.84] just like a baby doesn't have an immune
[1195.28 - 1199.68] system yet in the womb
[1197.84 - 1201.28] just like that okay something that's
[1199.68 - 1203.84] really important to know but the egg is
[1201.28 - 1206.00] obviously different than a baby
[1203.84 - 1208.48] but the egg doesn't have its own immune
[1206.00 - 1210.40] system the other thing is
[1208.48 - 1212.16] is that the egg the underdeveloped
[1210.40 - 1214.16] protein so the proteins are
[1212.16 - 1215.28] underdeveloped they're not a full
[1214.16 - 1218.56] complete
[1215.28 - 1220.88] protein like in a piece of meat it's
[1218.56 - 1223.92] already been formed so protein that's in
[1220.88 - 1226.08] any kind of meat right so
[1223.92 - 1227.12] the virus doesn't feed on that it's
[1226.08 - 1230.16] learned to feed
[1227.12 - 1233.20] on the egg okay so that's
[1230.16 - 1234.00] tissue of an animal or another food by
[1233.20 - 1237.04] itself
[1234.00 - 1238.72] won't won't allow the the virus to
[1237.04 - 1240.32] proliferate that's important too
[1238.72 - 1241.84] so this is really good information to
[1240.32 - 1244.56] keep in mind so we need
[1241.84 - 1246.32] when we eat our eggs we're eating our
[1244.56 - 1247.92] eggs right
[1246.32 - 1249.20] and that's why they used eggs because of
[1247.92 - 1250.48] these reasons i'm telling you but so
[1249.20 - 1252.88] when we eat our eggs
[1250.48 - 1254.56] and we're already got problems right we
[1252.88 - 1255.60] got the chronic fatigue syndrome we got
[1254.56 - 1258.32] the depression
[1255.60 - 1258.88] we got the endometriosis we got the pcos
[1258.32 - 1260.80] we got
[1258.88 - 1262.48] uh the fibroids we got any kind of
[1260.80 - 1265.04] problems that we have
[1262.48 - 1266.00] right anything like eczema psoriasis
[1265.04 - 1268.48] fibromyalgia
[1266.00 - 1270.24] lupus right thyroid disease thyroid
[1268.48 - 1272.72] disorders hypothyroidism
[1270.24 - 1273.84] i could go on and on and on right lupus
[1272.72 - 1278.24] lyme disease
[1273.84 - 1280.16] multiple sclerosis ra sarcoidosis
[1278.24 - 1281.84] we can go on all day autoimmune
[1280.16 - 1285.28] autoimmune autoimmune
[1281.84 - 1288.64] okay and what that is is those are bugs
[1285.28 - 1290.88] those are viruses those are epstein-barr
[1288.64 - 1292.32] so when we eat our eggs when we're doing
[1290.88 - 1295.04] that okay
[1292.32 - 1295.68] the bugs will eat the eggs inside of us
[1295.04 - 1298.24] we
[1295.68 - 1299.68] put the eggs in we swallow them they go
[1298.24 - 1302.00] through a process
[1299.68 - 1303.60] and then the bugs love to feed on the
[1302.00 - 1304.00] eggs now if you're healthy you don't
[1303.60 - 1305.52] have much
[1304.00 - 1307.68] going on yet you don't have a lot of
[1305.52 - 1309.20] bugs you could eat eggs for years
[1307.68 - 1310.56] you know it could be that person that
[1309.20 - 1311.84] eats them and you're not getting sick
[1310.56 - 1313.92] and then all of a sudden now
[1311.84 - 1316.80] you're hypothyroid all of a sudden you
[1313.92 - 1318.24] got hot flashes heart palpitations see
[1316.80 - 1319.84] that's how it works covering a little
[1318.24 - 1321.84] egg information let's start cooking a
[1319.84 - 1325.20] little bit
[1321.84 - 1327.92] you call it cooking making a salad
[1325.20 - 1328.72] can't let the virus go living in an
[1327.92 - 1331.28] animal
[1328.72 - 1332.00] because they can't have the they can't
[1331.28 - 1334.48] have the virus
[1332.00 - 1336.48] sit inside a living animal because of
[1334.48 - 1338.40] the living animal's immune system will
[1336.48 - 1342.64] work on beating it down
[1338.40 - 1344.88] okay an animal has its own immune system
[1342.64 - 1345.84] that's how it works so they grow the
[1344.88 - 1348.56] viruses
[1345.84 - 1349.84] in eggs then when they're released into
[1348.56 - 1352.96] the environment
[1349.84 - 1356.64] like they have been on us they get in us
[1352.96 - 1358.88] and our immune system controls them okay
[1356.64 - 1360.64] controls them unless we break down with
[1358.88 - 1364.32] all the triggers i talked about
[1360.64 - 1367.36] that's how it's done all right
[1364.32 - 1369.28] and um until eventually and see what
[1367.36 - 1370.88] happens is too is they need the egg to
[1369.28 - 1373.04] keep the virus in the egg like
[1370.88 - 1374.64] just like in the video right in the labs
[1373.04 - 1376.40] they put the viruses in the egg because
[1374.64 - 1378.64] they can control the environment
[1376.40 - 1380.96] it's just that egg you put the virus
[1378.64 - 1382.24] into a living animal you can't control
[1380.96 - 1383.60] it anymore it's gone
[1382.24 - 1385.28] you got the living animal's immune
[1383.60 - 1387.44] system working on it
[1385.28 - 1388.80] it's lost in the living animal itself
[1387.44 - 1390.72] it's different than when you have it
[1388.80 - 1393.36] controlled in this little tiny micro
[1390.72 - 1394.32] environment anyway okay all right all
[1393.36 - 1398.96] right all right all right

[1427.92 - 1431.76] good live today hey thanks it's a good
[1430.24 - 1432.80] live because i got you guys here and
[1431.76 - 1434.08] that's what makes it good
[1432.80 - 1435.92] can you imagine if you guys weren't here
[1434.08 - 1439.28] and i was just doing this myself
[1435.92 - 1439.28] it would be a bad live
[1439.68 - 1444.32] um caney i got canker sores from two
[1442.64 - 1447.76] weeks of eating raw
[1444.32 - 1449.84] and fat free and i'm still super bloated
[1447.76 - 1451.60] um what else are you doing are you raw
[1449.84 - 1453.36] and fat free
[1451.60 - 1456.00] be your own detective i want you to be
[1453.36 - 1459.04] able to be your own detective here okay
[1456.00 - 1460.16] all right so um first of all uh no
[1459.04 - 1462.88] nutritional yeast
[1460.16 - 1464.64] i'm assuming no apples no raw apple
[1462.88 - 1467.12] cider vinegar
[1464.64 - 1467.76] raw apple cider vinegar do people eat
[1467.12 - 1469.76] raw
[1467.76 - 1470.96] and they do apple cider vinegar just
[1469.76 - 1473.60] keep that in mind
[1470.96 - 1474.80] apple cider vinegar not good natural
[1473.60 - 1477.24] flavors
[1474.80 - 1479.44] what natural flavors are in your
[1477.24 - 1481.04] supplementation what natural flavors are
[1479.44 - 1482.72] in your raw kale chips
[1481.04 - 1484.48] that you might have bought in a package
[1482.72 - 1486.24] what natural flavors
[1484.48 - 1488.32] look out for that it's a nutritional
[1486.24 - 1492.16] yeast apple cider vinegar
[1488.32 - 1495.20] natural flavors keep in mind citric acid
[1492.16 - 1496.48] not an orange put citric acid that's in
[1495.20 - 1498.48] all kinds of products
[1496.48 - 1500.08] all kinds of foods all kinds of
[1498.48 - 1501.92] supplements keep in mind for that
[1500.08 - 1503.12] one too i want you to be your own
[1501.92 - 1505.60] detective
[1503.12 - 1508.32] very important okay so that that that
[1505.60 - 1511.60] alone is is critical right
[1508.32 - 1512.64] and now canker virus is already in your
[1511.60 - 1515.04] system
[1512.64 - 1516.96] so you never got a canker sore ever
[1515.04 - 1518.56] before in your life or is this the first
[1516.96 - 1520.32] time you got a canker sore
[1518.56 - 1522.08] if it's the first time you got a canker
[1520.32 - 1524.96] store that broke out okay
[1522.08 - 1526.48] where did it come from did it was it's a
[1524.96 - 1528.16] recent exposure
[1526.48 - 1529.84] which happens to people it's trying to
[1528.16 - 1531.20] get you to be your own detective that's
[1529.84 - 1533.20] important to know
[1531.20 - 1534.80] um and you got to keep in mind that
[1533.20 - 1535.92] you're starting to cleanse
[1534.80 - 1538.08] so when you're starting to cleanse
[1535.92 - 1539.84] you're getting rid of all that sludge
[1538.08 - 1542.64] all that stuff inside the liver inside
[1539.84 - 1545.44] the body the other thing is um
[1542.64 - 1546.56] you know it it's it's you're off fat all
[1545.44 - 1549.92] together
[1546.56 - 1551.84] so and totally fat free keep in mind
[1549.92 - 1553.52] there's no oils there's no avocados look
[1551.84 - 1554.72] out for all of that that's something
[1553.52 - 1557.20] that could be helpful
[1554.72 - 1558.96] um so all these things are key and i
[1557.20 - 1560.08] think you're off the fat i'm pretty sure
[1558.96 - 1562.88] you said that right
[1560.08 - 1564.48] but you never had any bloating before
[1562.88 - 1566.96] are you trying to are you you're trying
[1564.48 - 1568.72] to fix everything in two weeks
[1566.96 - 1571.36] why are you even doing it you must have
[1568.72 - 1573.12] had problems so ask yourself
[1571.36 - 1575.20] were you bloated ever before in your
[1573.12 - 1576.16] life did you ever have a kinky sword in
[1575.20 - 1579.20] your life
[1576.16 - 1580.88] were you ever were you ever sick did you
[1579.20 - 1581.84] have any symptoms because people don't
[1580.88 - 1585.44] go raw
[1581.84 - 1586.88] for two weeks um and just go raw for two
[1585.44 - 1589.36] weeks unless they they've been
[1586.88 - 1592.48] struggling no one wants to go raw
[1589.36 - 1595.04] so and and did you instinctively feel
[1592.48 - 1596.32] something was coming like you
[1595.04 - 1598.96] instinctively knew
[1596.32 - 1599.36] you had to go raw because something was
[1598.96 - 1601.84] on
[1599.36 - 1603.04] its way because that happens intuitively
[1601.84 - 1606.00] that's how we do it
[1603.04 - 1608.00] intuitively we're starting to feel
[1606.00 - 1609.52] something we don't we can't line up to
[1608.00 - 1610.64] it yet but man i gotta take care of
[1609.52 - 1613.04] myself now
[1610.64 - 1615.36] i gotta start going raw i gotta start
[1613.04 - 1616.64] taking care of myself now it's intuitive
[1615.36 - 1616.96] you know and it's like it's in there
[1616.64 - 1619.68] like
[1616.96 - 1620.00] i gotta start now something was already
[1619.68 - 1622.48] on
[1620.00 - 1624.24] its way all these things are important
[1622.48 - 1624.88] to keep in mind while you're trying to
[1624.24 - 1628.00] heal
[1624.88 - 1630.24] now what i would do is i would
[1628.00 - 1632.00] i would do one of the mono eating
[1630.24 - 1633.36] cleanses and cleanse the heel ask your
[1632.00 - 1634.56] doctor what's right for you but that's
[1633.36 - 1636.72] what i would do
[1634.56 - 1639.76] so i would do one of the mono eating
[1636.72 - 1642.80] cleanses i would do papaya
[1639.76 - 1644.08] celery juice for a couple of days that's
[1642.80 - 1646.40] that's what i would do and
[1644.08 - 1647.60] take it one step at a time and then you
[1646.40 - 1650.64] don't have to be
[1647.60 - 1652.56] all raw meaning that's what i would tell
[1650.64 - 1653.60] somebody like a doctor friend asking me
[1652.56 - 1656.00] this very question
[1653.60 - 1657.76] you can then go to steamed potatoes as
[1656.00 - 1659.20] one of those meals and do the
[1657.76 - 1661.04] mono eating cleanse with steamed
[1659.20 - 1661.76] potatoes we've got some steamed potatoes
[1661.04 - 1664.08] here
[1661.76 - 1664.88] and that's another way of doing things
[1664.08 - 1668.40] too
[1664.88 - 1669.92] but you know and and so and is it in all
[1668.40 - 1673.12] raw from
[1669.92 - 1676.48] someone else's all raw like their idea
[1673.12 - 1678.88] of all raw or is it the advanced 369
[1676.48 - 1679.84] is it the advanced 369 with all the
[1678.88 - 1682.24] direction
[1679.84 - 1684.00] and the questions answered and
[1682.24 - 1687.60] everything under the sun
[1684.00 - 1689.68] or is it just some raw diet someone says
[1687.60 - 1693.44] hey go do this go raw
[1689.68 - 1695.60] and or is it to 28 day cleanse right
[1693.44 - 1697.20] is it the 28 day cleanse in medical
[1695.60 - 1698.96] medium new addition so these are some
[1697.20 - 1701.68] things to keep in mind
[1698.96 - 1702.56] because that's going to be very helpful
[1701.68 - 1704.80] kirsten
[1702.56 - 1705.84] i was diagnosed diagnosed with multiple
[1704.80 - 1708.40] sclerosis

[1737.20 - 1741.20] and kill us with these eggs that's what
[1739.12 - 1743.36] they'll do every single practitioner
[1741.20 - 1745.52] every single doctor
[1743.36 - 1747.12] they'll just they'll just make you doubt
[1745.52 - 1751.36] yourself is what they'll do

[1782.40 - 1789.52] that's how they do it gina why is acv
[1786.40 - 1791.44] bad acv is bad
[1789.52 - 1793.36] um because well first of all i got a
[1791.44 - 1794.88] podcast medical mean podcast at apple
[1793.36 - 1796.88] podcast have you guys
[1794.88 - 1799.44] checked that out medical medium podcast
[1796.88 - 1801.12] at apple podcast really important
[1799.44 - 1804.64] because that is a really important
[1801.12 - 1806.88] podcast right there
[1804.64 - 1808.64] and why is apple cider vinegar that was
[1806.88 - 1810.24] just one it's the teeth destroyer pulls
[1808.64 - 1812.16] calcium out of your teeth and bones it's
[1810.24 - 1814.56] the osteopenia creator
[1812.16 - 1816.16] apple cider vinegar will dissolve your
[1814.56 - 1817.92] teeth you will see it later on
[1816.16 - 1819.68] as it destroys your teeth as time goes
[1817.92 - 1820.64] on that's what vinegar does acetic acid
[1819.68 - 1822.32] that's just one thing
[1820.64 - 1823.92] to say about it could say a lot of other
[1822.32 - 1826.32] things there's a question there i wanted
[1823.92 - 1830.32] to read i think it went up
[1826.32 - 1832.64] um i hate when i see natural flavors so
[1830.32 - 1834.56] lena i hate when i see natural flavors
[1832.64 - 1835.76] and they don't say what's in it very
[1834.56 - 1839.20] misleading
[1835.76 - 1842.64] see guys here's how the world works
[1839.20 - 1845.76] there's bad people in the world okay
[1842.64 - 1848.24] i know there's this whole thing where no
[1845.76 - 1852.00] one's bad
[1848.24 - 1855.28] no one's bad so gassing six million jews
[1852.00 - 1858.00] was just i guess a mistake because
[1855.28 - 1859.20] no one's bad right so i know there's a
[1858.00 - 1863.36] new age
[1859.20 - 1865.76] vibe of no one's bad okay
[1863.36 - 1867.52] oh no they're not bad no one terrible
[1865.76 - 1871.52] things don't happen
[1867.52 - 1875.20] uh people aren't killed all the time um
[1871.52 - 1877.60] yeah people aren't like murdered okay
[1875.20 - 1879.20] people are just no there's no bad in the
[1877.60 - 1881.20] world i know there's a new age thing
[1879.20 - 1883.52] about there's no bad okay
[1881.20 - 1884.32] and i just can't just with it all right
[1883.52 - 1887.84] and
[1884.32 - 1890.24] the bad what it does it extends into
[1887.84 - 1891.88] like the msg world which is all your
[1890.24 - 1894.80] natural flavors
[1891.88 - 1898.40] msg natural flavors
[1894.80 - 1901.60] flavoring flavors natural flavors
[1898.40 - 1902.64] organic flavoring they hide it under
[1901.60 - 1904.24] that term
[1902.64 - 1905.76] that's why you don't hear msg anymore
[1904.24 - 1907.20] that's why you don't see msg on the
[1905.76 - 1909.76] labels right
[1907.20 - 1911.52] in the old days in the old days the
[1909.76 - 1914.32] early 2000s i'm just saying the early

[2033.92 - 2037.84] produce it's loaded with nicotine and
[2036.80 - 2039.84] msg
[2037.84 - 2041.92] and what weiman's does is they don't
[2039.84 - 2044.24] want everybody addicted to that
[2041.92 - 2045.12] ms sheets an addiction msg is an
[2044.24 - 2048.40] addictive
[2045.12 - 2048.88] a drug okay nicotine is an addictive
[2048.40 - 2051.84] drug
[2048.88 - 2054.24] caffeine is an addictive drug those very
[2051.84 - 2055.36] three things are in organic sprays they
[2054.24 - 2057.60] spray on everything
[2055.36 - 2059.68] and weiman's they do this thing where
[2057.60 - 2060.64] you can go a long time without any spray
[2059.68 - 2062.64] whatsoever then
[2060.64 - 2064.24] they'll do one little area and they'll
[2062.64 - 2066.00] do another little area and they'll test
[2064.24 - 2068.76] for pesticide
[2066.00 - 2069.92] residue and they use they use the
[2068.76 - 2073.52] non-pollinator
[2069.92 - 2074.96] damaging spray right and organic sprays
[2073.52 - 2078.16] with all that nicotine
[2074.96 - 2080.08] damages pollinators that's what they use
[2078.16 - 2081.76] so people think just because it's
[2080.08 - 2084.24] organic means that's it
[2081.76 - 2085.28] it's the greatest thing on the planet no
[2084.24 - 2087.84] it's not
[2085.28 - 2089.28] they spray the heck out of crops three
[2087.84 - 2091.36] times a week
[2089.28 - 2093.20] and so the why that's why the wild food
[2091.36 - 2093.84] is better than organic and i've said
[2093.20 - 2096.24] that it's
[2093.84 - 2098.40] better than organic that's the why men's
[2096.24 - 2100.24] wild blueberry juice but anyway
[2098.40 - 2103.08] you know it's important to know when it
[2100.24 - 2106.40] comes down to that
[2103.08 - 2109.68] m-i-a already healed with your
[2106.40 - 2111.68] information and now my psoriasis is back
[2109.68 - 2113.36] so bad anthony so you already healed one
[2111.68 - 2115.44] time and it's back

[2115.44 - 2118.48] podcast on psoriasis too so that's
[2117.60 - 2121.44] important
[2118.48 - 2122.80] so if it's actually back okay then you
[2121.44 - 2125.28] got to look i'll do it

[2781.52 - 2785.60] the dreams of people healing
[2783.60 - 2787.36] that might be trying it or just starting
[2785.60 - 2791.36] it because i want to be
[2787.36 - 2794.16] you know a mean person what am i doing
[2791.36 - 2796.48] i'm doing nutritional yeast really
[2794.16 - 2798.00] that's that's that's not medical medium
[2796.48 - 2799.20] nutritional yeast isn't medical medium
[2798.00 - 2801.68] what do you mean it's not medical medium
[2799.20 - 2803.60] oh i never really read the books
[2801.68 - 2805.60] oh yeah you're right i never really read
[2803.60 - 2807.28] the books and never really learned
[2805.60 - 2809.20] not to do like apple cider vinegar and
[2807.28 - 2810.96] nutritional yeast and everything else
[2809.20 - 2812.96] yeah so now i'm going to take it out on
[2810.96 - 2814.48] anthony make sure i ruin it for a whole
[2812.96 - 2816.96] bunch of people
[2814.48 - 2818.80] because us vegans love our nutritional
[2816.96 - 2821.04] yeast and don't want to let it go
[2818.80 - 2822.56] so why don't i put that post out still
[2821.04 - 2823.84] because you know it'd be good let's give
[2822.56 - 2825.92] them some more crap
[2823.84 - 2827.28] yeah um because you know what he also
[2825.92 - 2829.76] supports animal protein
[2827.28 - 2831.60] lovers too so he supports animal protein
[2829.76 - 2833.92] people just like he supports us vegans
[2831.60 - 2834.96] and we kind of don't like that us vegans
[2833.92 - 2837.28] we hate him for that
[2834.96 - 2838.40] so yeah let's do the post yeah i know
[2837.28 - 2839.76] i'm not feeling good because it's
[2838.40 - 2841.44] nutritional yeast you're right you're
[2839.76 - 2843.12] right probably is that
[2841.44 - 2844.64] okay okay i'll just still say i did
[2843.12 - 2846.00] medical medium even though i'm not doing
[2844.64 - 2846.88] medical medium i'm gonna say i did
[2846.00 - 2848.80] medical medium
[2846.88 - 2850.56] i'm gonna put a post out and say i did
[2848.80 - 2852.16] medical medium it didn't work for me
[2850.56 - 2855.92] okay ready i'm getting ready to write it
[2852.16 - 2855.92] let's do it let's totally screw him over

[2867.76 - 2873.36] in a mood today huh
[2870.24 - 2877.84] and um
[2873.36 - 2877.84] i'm gonna eat this salad i can't wait
[2878.56 - 2880.88] um
[2884.72 - 2888.40] you know i was talking about the b12 you
[2886.64 - 2889.76] guys are because i saw one question come
[2888.40 - 2892.16] up about the b12
[2889.76 - 2894.08] the b12 i use is the vimergy b12 because
[2892.16 - 2894.72] i use the vimergy supplements that's the
[2894.08 - 2897.28] ones
[2894.72 - 2898.64] that i only use right now um because i
[2897.28 - 2899.60] trust them the best and it's the best
[2898.64 - 2902.24] stuff out there
[2899.60 - 2902.88] i'm not sponsored by vimergy just so you
[2902.24 - 2905.20] know
[2902.88 - 2905.92] but the when i was talking about like in
[2905.20 - 2908.00] the egg
[2905.92 - 2910.00] everybody's talking about inside the egg
[2908.00 - 2911.68] how you know oh there's bees in there
[2910.00 - 2912.48] and so forth well first of all there's
[2911.68 - 2915.04] more bees
[2912.48 - 2915.84] inside spinach that actually really get
[2915.04 - 2917.12] to the point
[2915.84 - 2919.12] but if you're somebody that wants to
[2917.12 - 2921.44] take b12 or you're looking for a b12
[2919.12 - 2923.28] there's no b12 better than this that's
[2921.44 - 2926.96] the vimergy these in victor i
[2923.28 - 2928.16] am as in mary ergy so that's just so you
[2926.96 - 2929.76] know the one i take
[2928.16 - 2931.60] that's the best one there is because i
[2929.76 - 2932.56] know that i saw a b12 i thought i saw a
[2931.60 - 2934.16] b
[2932.56 - 2936.32] question come up because of the egg talk
[2934.16 - 2937.36] and i didn't answer it i have a b12
[2936.32 - 2939.36] podcast
[2937.36 - 2940.96] at medical beam podcast at apple podcast
[2939.36 - 2943.84] but i've seen the difference
[2940.96 - 2945.68] between what a real b12 does versus a
[2943.84 - 2947.12] crappy b12 i've seen people with
[2945.68 - 2949.44] fibromyalgia
[2947.12 - 2951.12] turn the corner because they got the
[2949.44 - 2954.16] right b12 i've seen
[2951.12 - 2955.92] people with ra start to get relief
[2954.16 - 2957.36] that's what i've seen when they do the
[2955.92 - 2958.96] right when they've done brought in the
[2957.36 - 2961.52] right b12
[2958.96 - 2962.00] and you know i've seen the change in
[2961.52 - 2964.96] people
[2962.00 - 2967.28] mentally emotionally physically when
[2964.96 - 2969.68] it's the right b12
[2967.28 - 2971.84] without the natural flavors and without
[2969.68 - 2973.28] the other stuff even the other b12s i've
[2971.84 - 2974.32] noticed that don't have natural flavors
[2973.28 - 2975.60] because they're trying to
[2974.32 - 2977.84] they're you know there's only a couple
[2975.60 - 2978.80] out there that may not have it i noticed
[2977.84 - 2980.72] though it's real
[2978.80 - 2982.72] cheap it comes from a different place
[2980.72 - 2983.20] it's a cheap version it's not mixed
[2982.72 - 2985.44] right
[2983.20 - 2986.88] but it's like that's what i've noticed
[2985.44 - 2988.80] so i recommend this one for
[2986.88 - 2990.56] for doctors so their patients have a
[2988.80 - 2992.40] higher healing
[2990.56 - 2993.92] factor and that's the one thing so
[2992.40 - 2996.08] that's the vimorji
[2993.92 - 2997.12] with the no natural flavors the whole
[2996.08 - 2999.04] bit
[2997.12 - 3000.48] and so that's the one there the b12
[2999.04 - 3002.88] because i saw that question
[3000.48 - 3004.48] nutritional yeast is vegan crack jenny
[3002.88 - 3008.08] it totally is
[3004.48 - 3012.16] it's msg and it's total vegan crap
[3008.08 - 3014.56] that's what it is and crack but look
[3012.16 - 3016.64] i always say if you're going to be vegan
[3014.56 - 3019.52] be vegan and be plant-based
[3016.64 - 3020.64] i'm very pro-plant-based okay you guys
[3019.52 - 3023.92] know that right
[3020.64 - 3026.32] but i'm not a vegan propaganda channel
[3023.92 - 3027.36] because i believe if you want to eat
[3026.32 - 3029.84] animal protein
[3027.36 - 3031.20] you can still heal and still do the
[3029.84 - 3032.88] 28-day cleanse
[3031.20 - 3034.96] then bring your animal protein back in
[3032.88 - 3036.64] later you need more healing do the
[3034.96 - 3038.72] 28-day cleanse again
[3036.64 - 3041.20] then bring the animal protein back in
[3038.72 - 3042.88] later it depends on what's happening
[3041.20 - 3044.96] but keeping the fats down because i've
[3042.88 - 3047.36] seen vegans and plant-based people
[3044.96 - 3048.80] fat themselves to death too much avocado
[3047.36 - 3051.68] nuts seeds and oils
[3048.80 - 3053.20] right and they just can't heal and then
[3051.68 - 3054.00] they're doing nutritional yeast and then
[3053.20 - 3056.08] you're doing apple cider
[3054.00 - 3058.32] vinegar and they're just they can't heal
[3056.08 - 3060.48] and then they they fail
[3058.32 - 3061.92] and then they run back to eating eggs
[3060.48 - 3063.28] again so then now they run back to
[3061.92 - 3064.80] eating eggs now they run
[3063.28 - 3067.04] back to animal protein and i've seen
[3064.80 - 3069.20] animal protein people fail
[3067.04 - 3070.08] when all they had to do was was know
[3069.20 - 3072.08] what to do
[3070.08 - 3073.68] and they can still keep you know and
[3072.08 - 3075.52] they get sick and then they gotta run
[3073.68 - 3076.32] now vegan like everybody's running back
[3075.52 - 3079.76] and forth
[3076.32 - 3083.04] no one has the real answers and it's sad
[3079.76 - 3085.68] so um it's about being
[3083.04 - 3086.72] keeping the radical fats out while
[3085.68 - 3088.64] you're healing
[3086.72 - 3090.24] what from when you're sick and you keep
[3088.64 - 3091.92] the radical fats out
[3090.24 - 3093.60] that's part of it i've seen them all fat
[3091.92 - 3094.96] themselves of death nutritional yeast
[3093.60 - 3097.12] themselves to death
[3094.96 - 3098.32] i've seen it all and it's fine it's like
[3097.12 - 3100.40] well whatever but
[3098.32 - 3102.88] you know do what you want to do and then
[3100.40 - 3105.44] you'll get somebody that's like well
[3102.88 - 3107.12] you know intuitively i think this is
[3105.44 - 3108.48] right for me i feel good about my
[3107.12 - 3110.16] nutritional yeast it's like well your
[3108.48 - 3113.52] intuitive powers really really
[3110.16 - 3115.36] suck because you're not
[3113.52 - 3117.04] you're going to get in trouble you just
[3115.36 - 3118.96] are it's like
[3117.04 - 3120.08] we lose our intuitive abilities that's
[3118.96 - 3122.96] how the system
[3120.08 - 3123.52] we lose because the addiction takes over
[3122.96 - 3124.96] it's like
[3123.52 - 3126.32] it's like it's like people who are
[3124.96 - 3127.36] addicted to caffeine they're eating
[3126.32 - 3128.80] their chocolate all the time they're
[3127.36 - 3131.12] addicted to their matcha tea
[3128.80 - 3132.72] they're addicted to their coffee and
[3131.12 - 3134.64] it's like you know what i mean
[3132.72 - 3136.96] okay i trust your intuitive abilities
[3134.64 - 3139.36] okay you're totally addicted
[3136.96 - 3141.84] to caffeine which is fine but let's just
[3139.36 - 3143.92] not let's just not like get carried away
[3141.84 - 3145.28] and think we got it all down like we got
[3143.92 - 3146.40] all the answers see a lot of people in
[3145.28 - 3148.08] the health scene
[3146.40 - 3150.16] that are doing all that caffeine but
[3148.08 - 3151.04] they're all on their social media
[3150.16 - 3153.36] they're they're all
[3151.04 - 3155.12] experts like experts really and you're
[3153.36 - 3157.52] jacked up on caffeine because you can't
[3155.12 - 3160.48] function without the caffeine
[3157.52 - 3161.60] so um i'm gonna put some potato on here
[3160.48 - 3163.20] too and that's next
[3161.60 - 3165.04] well let's put some zucchini i didn't
[3163.20 - 3166.64] have cucumbers
[3165.04 - 3168.80] i think i might have them but i couldn't
[3166.64 - 3170.56] i couldn't find them you know but
[3168.80 - 3172.16] in time but i got some zucchinis here
[3170.56 - 3175.28] i'm going to cut the top off i like
[3172.16 - 3178.16] zucchini it's a really great food for so
[3175.28 - 3179.36] many reasons okay
[3178.16 - 3180.80] so what i'm doing is cutting the
[3179.36 - 3182.24] zucchini i'm going to cut it in half
[3180.80 - 3185.92] down the middle like this
[3182.24 - 3187.84] okay and i'm going to cut little pieces
[3185.92 - 3190.80] like this i'm going to put a few of
[3187.84 - 3190.80] these on the salad
[3193.68 - 3197.76] if you want to heal it's good to keep
[3196.16 - 3199.52] the fats down now when your animal
[3197.76 - 3201.84] protein okay here's the thing
[3199.52 - 3203.60] if you need to take a break between your
[3201.84 - 3205.52] healing process right like
[3203.60 - 3207.76] you're doing the three six nine and
[3205.52 - 3209.68] you're working on really healing right
[3207.76 - 3211.28] you're doing the 28-day cleanse and
[3209.68 - 3212.16] you're working on really healing right
[3211.28 - 3214.16] you guys
[3212.16 - 3216.72] if you want to cut it back and take a
[3214.16 - 3218.40] break and be like well you know what
[3216.72 - 3220.40] i want to i still want to eat healthy
[3218.40 - 3222.48] but what do i do i eat animal protein
[3220.40 - 3223.28] like how do i do this aw like how do i
[3222.48 - 3225.04] do it
[3223.28 - 3226.88] and well then you can bring your
[3225.04 - 3229.36] sardines and you put your sardines on
[3226.88 - 3231.92] your salad instead of your potatoes
[3229.36 - 3233.28] right you if you're into chicken and
[3231.92 - 3234.48] chicken's a thing you eat and you're
[3233.28 - 3236.32] always eating your chicken and stuff
[3234.48 - 3238.24] like that you put a little chicken
[3236.32 - 3239.36] on top of your salad if meat something
[3238.24 - 3240.88] you put a little
[3239.36 - 3242.72] you know little bit of meat or some
[3240.88 - 3243.68] salmon right if you're animal protein
[3242.72 - 3246.72] but remember
[3243.68 - 3248.16] those are fats and if you're still sick
[3246.72 - 3250.48] you want to get to the point where you
[3248.16 - 3251.44] drop the fats again maybe do the 28 day
[3250.48 - 3254.88] cleanse again
[3251.44 - 3257.76] maybe do a 369 like original 369 or
[3254.88 - 3258.80] simplify but you keep the fats kind of
[3257.76 - 3261.28] at bay or
[3258.80 - 3263.44] you do the animal protein once a day and
[3261.28 - 3264.00] if you're vegan you do your avocado once
[3263.44 - 3267.44] a day at
[3264.00 - 3268.24] the end of the day right but keep the
[3267.44 - 3270.32] potatoes
[3268.24 - 3271.92] out if you bring in your avocado because
[3270.32 - 3273.12] you're vegan plant-based and you bring
[3271.92 - 3274.56] in your nut butters because you're vegan
[3273.12 - 3276.32] and plant-based and you're bringing your
[3274.56 - 3277.92] salmon because you're animal-based
[3276.32 - 3280.40] and you bring in whatever it is because
[3277.92 - 3283.20] you're animal-based make sure
[3280.40 - 3284.00] you keep the potatoes out of the picture
[3283.20 - 3287.12] details
[3284.00 - 3290.64] matter details make or
[3287.12 - 3293.68] break natural flavor is a detail
[3290.64 - 3297.76] that makes or break nutritional yeast
[3293.68 - 3300.88] detail that makes or break blood draw

[3373.60 - 3378.40] all over the arm right there by the way
[3375.12 - 3378.40] here you are vegan okay
[3378.56 - 3381.60] here you are vegan and you think you're
[3380.80 - 3383.68] doing good
[3381.60 - 3385.60] you're getting your blood tested and
[3383.68 - 3387.12] you're not feeling good anyway and they
[3385.60 - 3389.44] take your immune system
[3387.12 - 3391.84] out with all the blood that's what they
[3389.44 - 3394.08] do they take your immune system out
[3391.84 - 3395.20] with all the blood they remove your
[3394.08 - 3398.80] white count
[3395.20 - 3401.20] right your white count okay and
[3398.80 - 3403.20] when they do that they take your blood
[3401.20 - 3404.72] out be open-hearted says just had blood
[3403.20 - 3407.52] work done my ldl
[3404.72 - 3408.88] dropped 30 points but my hdl dropped
[3407.52 - 3412.40] also to 44
[3408.88 - 3414.72] i'm doing i'm doing no fat
[3412.40 - 3415.76] um due to fatty liver disease you're
[3414.72 - 3417.60] working on healing
[3415.76 - 3419.92] be open-hearted just you know glad
[3417.60 - 3422.48] you're here um honored you're here
[3419.92 - 3423.76] so your bloodstream doesn't your
[3422.48 - 3426.40] bloodstream doesn't just
[3423.76 - 3428.64] reproduce an immune system comes from
[3426.40 - 3431.68] your bones it doesn't happen overnight
[3428.64 - 3433.84] okay and your blood fills with water you
[3431.68 - 3436.00] can drink water get hydrated and you're
[3433.84 - 3437.20] you're getting the tank full but you're
[3436.00 - 3440.16] missing your
[3437.20 - 3440.64] cbc a big hunk of your cbc they take it
[3440.16 - 3442.88] all
[3440.64 - 3444.48] right they take it all and then your
[3442.88 - 3446.24] immune system goes with it huge trigger
[3444.48 - 3446.72] for chronic illness it keeps the vegan
[3446.24 - 3448.16] sick
[3446.72 - 3449.84] it keeps the plant-based person sick it
[3448.16 - 3451.12] keeps the animal protein sick you lose
[3449.84 - 3452.72] your glucose and electrolytes you're
[3451.12 - 3453.92] sick now you kick back for a week or two
[3452.72 - 3455.92] takes three to six months to get your
[3453.92 - 3457.76] immune system back your cbc
[3455.92 - 3458.96] so i talk about on the podcast what to
[3457.76 - 3460.48] do i'm not against
[3458.96 - 3462.08] getting your blood taken not against
[3460.48 - 3464.48] blood draw right
[3462.08 - 3465.68] and i've been recommending lately to
[3464.48 - 3466.80] friends and family they're like what
[3465.68 - 3468.24] should i do and one of the things i
[3466.80 - 3470.24] didn't put in the podcast is
[3468.24 - 3472.24] do a shot of wild blueberry juice if you
[3470.24 - 3474.64] had blood draw do a shot every single
[3472.24 - 3476.48] week before weeks after but
[3474.64 - 3479.84] of the wild blueberry juice but the
[3476.48 - 3481.60] description of the blood draw podcast is
[3479.84 - 3483.60] sorry the link is in the description but
[3481.60 - 3485.20] they take way too much blood they take
[3483.60 - 3486.88] way too much of your immune system your
[3485.20 - 3488.96] red blood cell count right they take too
[3486.88 - 3491.12] much and then
[3488.96 - 3492.48] that's when the trigger happens and all
[3491.12 - 3494.00] of a sudden now you get sicker and
[3492.48 - 3495.44] sicker then they take more blood because
[3494.00 - 3496.00] you get sicker listen to the podcast
[3495.44 - 3497.60] episode
[3496.00 - 3500.24] it's called blood draw bloodletting

[3517.28 - 3521.04] vampires
[3518.96 - 3522.80] and in the end it's not even their fault
[3521.04 - 3524.32] right it's not even the doctor's fault

[4187.76 - 4192.48] thimble's worth you know which is a lot
[4189.60 - 4194.64] of drops but it's just unbelievable

[4203.84 - 4207.04] didn't you tell us all these years we've
[4205.12 - 4208.80] been following i did i talked about it
[4207.04 - 4210.08] in so many occasions but i guess i had
[4208.80 - 4212.16] to make it the entire
[4210.08 - 4213.28] platform to really get the message out
[4212.16 - 4215.92] yvonne i'm a nurse
[4213.28 - 4218.32] and i understand incredible it really is
[4215.92 - 4220.48] it's incredible
[4218.32 - 4221.68] all right so i got the dressing it's
[4220.48 - 4223.92] done
[4221.68 - 4225.28] i got my salad right here okay and i
[4223.92 - 4226.72] talked about different options you can
[4225.28 - 4228.24] have in here you can put
[4226.72 - 4230.00] if you want animal protein with the
[4228.24 - 4232.00] course you can but this is a healing
[4230.00 - 4233.68] meal for when you're healing in the
[4232.00 - 4235.20] moment you can do animal protein another
[4233.68 - 4237.20] day in your life with it
[4235.20 - 4238.72] or if you're if you're plant-based if
[4237.20 - 4240.16] you really want to do a little avocado
[4238.72 - 4241.84] with it or a little tahini or something
[4240.16 - 4245.12] because your plant-based that's okay
[4241.84 - 4246.16] right but but but realize that you know
[4245.12 - 4247.28] if you're working on your healing
[4246.16 - 4249.20] process having a
[4247.28 - 4250.32] no-fat meal sometimes would be really
[4249.20 - 4252.16] good
[4250.32 - 4254.00] and there's fats in all foods remember
[4252.16 - 4255.04] that there just is you know there's fats
[4254.00 - 4257.52] in all food
