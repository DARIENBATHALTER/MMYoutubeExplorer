00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,759
pressure low blood pressure with no real

35
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,479
evidence of heart

36
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:32,040

they're eating way too much fat for a 50

46
00:01:54,439 --> 00:02:01,039

whole point listen this is the only show

61
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,000
where the information is not repackaged

62
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,879
or recycled Theory that's what happens

63
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,920
out there that's revolving the revolver

64
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:39,640
the the the musical chairs of recycled

65
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,319
repackaged information out there of

66
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,599
theory it that's not what this show is

67
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:44,319
the information here doesn't come from

68
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:46,080
the medical interest groups that are

69
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:47,440
contaminated in all the information out

70
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,159
of their medical funding with strings

71
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,640
attached botch research that's a thumb

72
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:53,560
on the scale that's the whole thing paid

73
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:55,480
and bought paid and bought and

74
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,480
grandfathered in laws because of

75
00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:00,200
investors investing in money in botch

76
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:01,640
research you know uh funky sign out

77
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:04,280
there that everybody thinks is real but

78
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:05,920
it's not lobbyists internal Kickbacks

79
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:08,080
persuaded belief systems in the

80
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,760
alternative and and and conventional

81
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,360
medical Arenas private panels of

82
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,640
influencers with money going underneath

83
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,400
the table so the information is

84
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,040
contaminated and then it gets cited and

85
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,360
then peerreview studies and it goes into

86
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:19,680
book after book and it doesn't get

87
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,519
people better because it's contaminated

88
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,200
or trendy traps yes I have to say that

89
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:25,720
because guess what it's so important to

90
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,319
know that it's important to know that

91
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,200
the information in the show is the only

92
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:30,319
this is the only show where the

93
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,599
information is pure untampered with

94
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:35,000
clean and that's the you know what you

95
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:36,840
know let me tell you something if I had

96
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,319
the op if I didn't have this gift if I

97
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,799
didn't get this gift when I was age four

98
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:42,080
of knowing what's going on in hearing

99
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,000
spirit and having the information that

100
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,200
was Advanced and ahead of decades ahead

101
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,879
of that what's out there now with

102
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,840
information and help hundreds of

103
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:51,239
thousands of people over my whole

104
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,920
lifetime if I didn't have that gift and

105
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:55,879
I was just somebody out there looking

106
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:57,840
for answers and I I just and i' I've

107
00:03:55,879 --> 00:04:00,200
been and I was burned left and right

108
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,040
with reading different things and going

109
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:04,159
different places and spending tons and

110
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:06,640
tons of thousands of dollars and having

111
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:08,519
a mystery illness or diagnosed Illness

112
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:11,040
but who knows what was going on up and

113
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:13,360
down wrong or right and I had a chance

114
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:16,600
to hear information that wasn't attached

115
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:19,400
to any of that stuff any of that junk

116
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:21,759
science that was paid for out there

117
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:23,840
attached to any of that contamination

118
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:27,919
that I just mentioned if I had a chance

119
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:30,360
to hear free information meaning free

120
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:33,840
and clear from contamination

121
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:35,919
that had truth in it and it was real if

122
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,880
I had that chance I'd be like I'd be on

123
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:39,840
it and be like okay no I'm listening to

124
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:41,880
this because I understand I've been

125
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,280
around the block I know what's going on

126
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:46,000
I've suffered enough I know that I want

127
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,320
to hear this instead of the garbage

128
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,160
that's out there that's over and over

129
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:51,479
again in the experts books of today that

130
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:53,440
are unbelievable just recycled junk over

131
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:55,280
and over again belief systems and so

132
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,600
forth I would I would definitely want to

133
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,280
hear so that's just me maybe you maybe

134
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,400
you who tuned in the radio show you're

135
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,479
not interested but I'd be interested

136
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,560
100% And I'd be interested to know about

137
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:07,080
blood pressure cuz that's where we're

138
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,120
going now so here we are let's get

139
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:11,120
started with this how do we get high

140
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,960
blood pressure let's talk about that

141
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,240
first because you know that that's just

142
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,960
that's important to know how do we get

143
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:20,520
high blood pressure bad lifestyle we

144
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:22,080
don't exercise so we don't exercise we

145
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,400
have a bad lifestyle or something or not

146
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,360
a healthy lifestyle we're eating too

147
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:28,039
much processed food right and we start

148
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,639
getting high blood pressure doctor says

149
00:05:28,039 --> 00:05:31,639
look you got to you got to be careful

150
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:33,039
here you got to reduce your red meat I

151
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:35,880
don't know if doctors are saying that

152
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:38,000
anymore they're probably all pro pro red

153
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,160
meat eat more red meat that's where they

154
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,960
are now I think that's where it's

155
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,400
shifting it's shifting now where all the

156
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,960
medical doctors are like no matter what

157
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,639
they are whether they're functional or

158
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,319
regular conventional they're like no you

159
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:49,520
got to eat more meat you just got to get

160
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:51,560
rid of all fruit you know like fruit is

161
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,600
the cause of high blood pressure like

162
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:56,000
fruit like

163
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,639
fruit like fruit is the cause of high

164
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,520
blood pressure yeah okay I I'll buy that

165
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,280
one you know but just like doctors are

166
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,960
like you know at least they had

167
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:05,600
something right a few years back I think

168
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:09,520
it was about 10 years ago I think it was

169
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:11,240
about 10 years ago um 10 12 15 years ago

170
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,520
doctors like you know when people were

171
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:15,759
having when they were having coming in

172
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,840
with heart problems and or or high blood

173
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,319
pressure and they were coming into the

174
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,080
doctor's office they'd be like you got

175
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:22,639
to lower your red meat and this was

176
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,400
coming from conventional doctors I

177
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,800
remember that day when it was happening

178
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:30,479
and I was like finally something is

179
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:34,240
going right in the industries

180
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:36,360
finally something is going right and

181
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,800
guess what now you don't hear that it's

182
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:41,160
now it's just like no you need to eat

183
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,280
more red meat but grass-fed that's all

184
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,160
and you need to get rid of all your

185
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:48,840
sugar so don't eat any

186
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:51,199
fruit listen the whole the whole thing

187
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:54,840
that happens with blood pressure to

188
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:57,840
begin with comes from an organ in the

189
00:06:54,840 --> 00:07:01,759
body and it's not the heart it comes

190
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:03,560
from it it deres es from an organ the

191
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:05,319
problem can you guess what that organ is

192
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,400
you know what that organ is you know

193
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:08,080
what it is are you thinking are you

194
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,759
thinking brain is that what you're

195
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,440
thinking about what you're thinking

196
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:15,039
pancreas maybe you're thinking colon

197
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:18,080
maybe you're thinking gut maybe you're

198
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:19,360
thinking kidneys you know and well

199
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,800
kidneys has a little something to do

200
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,199
with it if you have kidney problems you

201
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,360
can get blood pressure problems but

202
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,800
there's a reason why you would get

203
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:29,759
kidney problems to begin with and what's

204
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:31,080
that organ what is it you guys remember

205
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,080
I might have talked about this before in

206
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:37,960
an old show or something like that it's

207
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:41,960
the liver the liver the liver that's the

208
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:45,080
organ interesting right

209
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:47,759
interesting the liver is responsible

210
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48,879
it's responsible for all mystery high

211
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:53,400
blood

212
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:56,960
pressure and mystery low blood

213
00:07:53,400 --> 00:08:00,120
pressure mystery high blood pressure

214
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,960
mystery low blood pressure

215
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,720
so in the high blood pressure Department

216
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:06,479
how does this work what even happens

217
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:12,560
what goes on first of all your heart

218
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:14,560
your heart it gets its blood from where

219
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,240
where does your heart get its blood from

220
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:20,199
uh just the blood

221
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:21,400
system from where does it get the blood

222
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:23,319
from you know when you think about it

223
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:26,159
it's like I don't know like where does

224
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:28,240
it it gets it from your liver that's

225
00:08:26,159 --> 00:08:33,599
where your heart gets its blood

226
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:36,880
from your liver has these hepatic portal

227
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:39,599
highways hepatic portal highways that's

228
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:42,479
what it is got the hepatic portal vein

229
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:45,279
comes from your colon drives up all

230
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:50,680
those nutrients so when you're eating

231
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:53,600
food your food breaks down miraculously

232
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:57,640
mysteriously inside your intestinal

233
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:59,959
tract and then nutrients along with

234
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:02,160
blood also

235
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:05,279
like up amazing nutrients a little bit

236
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,959
of oxygen all go up through these

237
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:11,079
capillaries and blood vessels and find

238
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:14,079
their way up the her hepatic

239
00:09:11,079 --> 00:09:16,200
vein hepatic vein in the portal system

240
00:09:14,079 --> 00:09:19,160
these are all the veins attached to your

241
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:22,440
colon and intestinal tract and

242
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:24,800
Elum all these veins and these veins

243
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:27,760
where do they lead into a highway a

244
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,760
massive Highway a massive Highway going

245
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,360
into your liver

246
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,000
your

247
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:38,399
liver and so these veins are drawn

248
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:42,399
blood's being sucked up sucked up these

249
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:46,320
veins that's right that's right your

250
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:48,640
heart's pumping and creating

251
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:51,320
suction so your heart's pumping and

252
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:54,640
creating suction so you see what I'm you

253
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:56,720
see where I'm going here so it's as it's

254
00:09:54,640 --> 00:10:00,320
as it's creating suction it's drawing

255
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:03,160
blood up these veins up the portal

256
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,399
hepatic portal Highway the veins heading

257
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:08,760
into the

258
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:11,560
liver so you with me and those veins

259
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:13,440
heading up to the liver they're all

260
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:17,320
filled with

261
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:20,160
blood blood that the heart's pumping and

262
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:22,680
drawing and creating

263
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,600
suction and what's that blood filled

264
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,839
with I know I told you a little bit a

265
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,640
couple minutes ago I just want to make

266
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:30,760
sure you're on this with me filled with

267
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:33,800
lots and lots of nutrients

268
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:35,920
phytochemicals vitamins minerals trace

269
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:42,639
minerals

270
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:44,680
oxygen and water and water water so all

271
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:46,880
that's being drawn up in that Highway of

272
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:49,720
blood goes into your

273
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,720
liver and a healthy liver is all happy

274
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:53,800
and it's taking all this healthy blood

275
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:55,320
in and a healthy liver is all happy it's

276
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:57,320
taking all this healthy blood in and

277
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:01,040
it's taking all this healthy blood in

278
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:03,440
and then and then it releases that blood

279
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:06,000
actually after it filters it it filters

280
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,480
it and it's dispersing all the nutrients

281
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,920
and everything they're going in all the

282
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,600
right places in the liver and the liver

283
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:14,480
is taking care of everything and the

284
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:17,920
blood then exits it exits the liver and

285
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:20,800
guess where it goes It goes to your

286
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,519
heart it goes to your

287
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,360
heart

288
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:28,040
interesting

289
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:29,920
interesting it's all packaged ready and

290
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:33,720
happy going to the

291
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:36,600
heart but guess what goes wrong guess

292
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:38,639
what goes wrong guess what I didn't

293
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,360
mention is in that blood and the hepatic

294
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:42,120
in the hepatic veins heading from the

295
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,720
colon to the liver to begin with

296
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:45,920
remember I'll go back a little ways

297
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:48,040
let's go back a couple of minutes

298
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,519
remember what how I said there's water

299
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,800
in that blood there's nutrients there's

300
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,079
phytochemicals there's minerals there's

301
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,959
trace minerals there's vitamins and

302
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:57,959
oxygen all coming in guess what else is

303
00:11:53,959 --> 00:12:02,839
in that blood poison poison toxic

304
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:05,600
poisons fat also fat cells from putrid

305
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:10,320
fat from eating too much too much too

306
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:15,360
much red meat lots of toxins and

307
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:18,160
poisons heavy metals solvents for

308
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:21,079
Malahide okay

309
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:24,680
everything everything

310
00:12:21,079 --> 00:12:26,639
chlorine all right from Water Systems

311
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:29,440
everything's going in

312
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:33,000
there I mean it's a Flor

313
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:35,639
all of it is just going in that Highway

314
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,120
up to the liver lots and lots of Gunk

315
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:40,279
and poison toxins and

316
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:41,680
debris so even though that blood is

317
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:43,199
filled with all this good stuff liquid

318
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,040
is filled with too all this bad stuff

319
00:12:43,199 --> 00:12:47,639
and guess what the liver has to collect

320
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:49,360
it filter it collect it filter it

321
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:51,079
collect it filter it collect it and

322
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,360
filter it and if we're not eating right

323
00:12:51,079 --> 00:12:54,760
and we're not taking care of ourselves

324
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:58,279
and we're not doing the right things or

325
00:12:54,760 --> 00:13:01,000
the liver's already burdened and already

326
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:04,120
held back from poisons and toxins it

327
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,120
inherited from birth and Beyond where

328
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:08,440
you it's inherited all the toxins the

329
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:10,279
old DDT you know the unforgiving for who

330
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:11,399
has life-changing Foods who has

331
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:14,920
life-changing Foods my book

332
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:17,639
life-changing foods do you guys have it

333
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:20,920
if anyone said I don't have

334
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:23,079
it if anyone says I don't have it I'll

335
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:25,079
just smack myself in the head or I'll

336
00:13:23,079 --> 00:13:26,760
bang my head on my desk right now let me

337
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:29,320
just do that let me just hit my head or

338
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:31,680
bang it against the wall

339
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:33,519
because you're missing out I didn't I

340
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:36,279
didn't kill

341
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:38,760
myself to take all the information from

342
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:41,480
Spirit and put it in life-changing food

343
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:43,600
so you so you wouldn't get the book

344
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:47,199
because in that book has the unforgiving

345
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:50,240
four because in that Highway of

346
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:51,959
nastiness the blood toxicity along with

347
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,759
all that good I mentioned that's heading

348
00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:55,360
up to the liver up the hepatic portal

349
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:58,079
highway coming from the colon heading

350
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:00,120
all the way up to the liver all that

351
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:03,560
toxic and poisonous stuff is the

352
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:05,079
unforgiving for it's old DDT that was

353
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,480
inside the liver to begin with it's

354
00:14:05,079 --> 00:14:08,639
pesticides and herbicides that are

355
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,160
actually now in our all in our you know

356
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,880
way now that we deal with every day

357
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,040
going up the blood oh going right in the

358
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:17,000
bloodstream there's all of that there's

359
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:18,959
also bacteria viral issues issues viral

360
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,519
byproduct all that stuff and even a

361
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:24,079
little radiation all that is going up

362
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:26,519
the hepatic portal

363
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:28,079
Highway and it gets into the liver if

364
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:30,279
the liver doesn't already have it in

365
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,800
there already to begin with and as this

366
00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:33,279
goes into the liver and it saturates the

367
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:36,839
liver and saturates the liver the liver

368
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:40,519
starts getting doggish and the Heart

369
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:42,279
relying on clean blood clean mean

370
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:45,800
machine

371
00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:49,199
blood the heart relying on

372
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:52,120
it is pumping harder and

373
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:55,000
harder because the filter is getting

374
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:58,120
thicker dirtier stagnant more sluggish

375
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,519
more doggish and when that and when that

376
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:01,199
livers get getting filled with more and

377
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,800
more of that stuff and we're not eating

378
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:05,360
right and and

379
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:08,000
instead instead we you know we we head

380
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:10,279
off to a high trendy high fat diet of

381
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,440
the day the flavor of the day that you

382
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:14,720
see on say a doctor show or you see out

383
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:17,279
there and you see some fancy new diet

384
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,120
fancy new book or something and we head

385
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:21,040
to that direction and we quit the

386
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:24,120
processed foods we start exercising we

387
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:29,360
may help the liver a little

388
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:31,519
bit but a little bit isn't enough

389
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,880
it isn't enough because it'll sneak up

390
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:36,440
on you and it'll bite you in the butt

391
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:37,839
later it'll sneak up on you and bite you

392
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,800
in the butt and you'll get that high

393
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,199
blood pressure down the road or you'll

394
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:43,000
get that low blood pressure or you'll

395
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:45,120
get a blood pressure problem one way or

396
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,480
another down the

397
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:50,839
road down the

398
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:53,639
road and you'll get that well that will

399
00:15:50,839 --> 00:15:57,040
happen even on you know a fancy cute

400
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:59,560
diet because it's not addressing the

401
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:01,720
real problem

402
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:03,639
and the the liver still getting dirty

403
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:05,600
along the way and still getting flooded

404
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:07,160
with poisons and still get it FL getting

405
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,319
flooded with

406
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:10,839
toxins so we're going to cover all that

407
00:16:09,319 --> 00:16:12,720
a little bit about what foods to do for

408
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:14,600
high blood pressure what we can eat what

409
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:17,000
we can do to knock high blood pressure

410
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:19,959
down and what we can do to stabilize

411
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:23,120
blood pressure this is this is exciting

412
00:16:19,959 --> 00:16:25,120
this is an exciting one so what happens

413
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,079
is when that liver gets filled and toxic

414
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,600
and stagnant and sluggish and doggish

415
00:16:27,079 --> 00:16:31,399
and filled with poisons what happen

416
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:35,079
happens you guys is the heart has to

417
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:36,519
pump harder and harder and harder and

418
00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:39,959
the

419
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:42,480
blood the blood isn't easy to come out

420
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:44,600
of the liver it's not easy it's not free

421
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,880
flowing out of the liver so easy so

422
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:49,880
there's pressure the suction occurs more

423
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:52,199
suction has to happen it's like sipping

424
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:55,240
through a straw instead of sipping water

425
00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:58,639
through a straw you're

426
00:16:55,240 --> 00:17:00,399
sipping something else through a straw

427
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:02,399
you're sipping like a

428
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:04,959
milkshake thick

429
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:07,240
milkshake or then you're then you're

430
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:11,160
sipping Jello-O through a

431
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:14,640
straw how about that one trying to sip

432
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:15,880
sip Jello-O through a straw and so

433
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,520
that's what

434
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:21,280
occurs and what happens is your liver

435
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:23,319
gets it gets dirty it's gets sluggish it

436
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,199
gets sick and then your blood gets dirty

437
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:27,400
and gets thick and your blood becomes

438
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:29,640
dirty and thick and then you're eating

439
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:31,440
more High fats more High fats whatever

440
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:33,240
diet you believe in whatever belief

441
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,240
system you've been sucked into you're

442
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,799
eating a higher fat diet without

443
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:38,720
realizing it even if you're doing

444
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:41,520
plant-based high fat even if you're

445
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,120
doing Paleo High fat or some autoimmune

446
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,760
high fat whatever you choose you're

447
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,720
doing you think it's high protein but

448
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:48,320
it's all high fat and you're doing more

449
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,960
high fat and what's happening is your

450
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,960
blood's getting more dehydrated thicker

451
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,240
and thicker and thicker unless you

452
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:58,200
unless you're doing things to offset the

453
00:17:55,240 --> 00:18:00,400
high fat diet a lot more juicing a

454
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:02,400
little a little less red meat and then

455
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,960
you know it won't get so thick but if

456
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,440
you're not it's still going to get thick

457
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:09,240
in the end it's still going to get thick

458
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:10,840
in the end like I said like I said 10 15

459
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:13,679
years ago and I think it was probably 15

460
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:15,360
years ago now time's Flying Too Fast

461
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,960
remember the doctors being like no keep

462
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,360
that red meat down you got to watch that

463
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,400
high blood pressure keep the red meat

464
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:23,440
down it was

465
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:27,320
brilliant brilliant absolutely brilliant

466
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:30,320
but those days are gone that smartness

467
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,320
smartness

468
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:37,559
that that goodness and smartness was

469
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:40,039
only there for a hot second and then

470
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:43,520
it's gone now every single doctor on the

471
00:18:40,039 --> 00:18:46,240
planet's like no no no animal protein no

472
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:48,280
sugar animal protein no

473
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,600
sugar I'm not saying I have anything

474
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,559
against animal protein I'm just saying

475
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,760
if you're dealing with high blood

476
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:53,080
pressure or something you might want to

477
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:56,559
switch up your game for a little while

478
00:18:53,080 --> 00:19:00,039
in your life and not have to be so stuck

479
00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:02,720
into a belief system

480
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:05,000
because belief systems will break you

481
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,919
down not break you down they'll get you

482
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,640
in the end because the belief system

483
00:19:06,919 --> 00:19:11,840
itself won't be looking out for you and

484
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:14,360
you'll get cheated shorted and you'll

485
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:18,280
get the the the bad end of this the

486
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:21,400
whole bad end of it all because belief

487
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:26,600
systems don't believe in

488
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:28,840
you belief systems don't protect you and

489
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:32,200
don't care about you in the end

490
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:34,000
and belief systems just can't they just

491
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:36,480
don't

492
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,159
so so what happens how do we get that

493
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,880
high blood pressure without having heart

494
00:19:38,159 --> 00:19:41,320
disease or cardiovascular disease or

495
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:43,039
anything like that how do we get it the

496
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:45,440
liver starts getting Mucky dirty

497
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:47,600
sluggish doggish

498
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,400
stagnant The Blood starts getting

499
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:52,559
thicker and thicker and thicker and then

500
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:56,600
the heart's working harder to pump blood

501
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:59,320
through a straw thick milkshake blood

502
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:00,960
through a straw

503
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:02,960
and that's what happens and if you're

504
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,799
vegetarian hey I don't eat red meat I'm

505
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,960
a

506
00:20:03,799 --> 00:20:09,559
vegetarian and that look I that's cool

507
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:12,120
you're vegetarian but if you're eating

508
00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:13,000
cheese clogging up that liver thickening

509
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:15,600
up the

510
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,919
blood and the heart has to pump through

511
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,919
a straw like that that that thick

512
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:23,280
milkshake through a straw versus water

513
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:25,080
through a straw it has to pull blood

514
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:28,360
through those

515
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:32,480
veins thick heavy blood fill the cheese

516
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:35,280
mucus mucus cheese Dairy

517
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:39,400
butter the butter thing out of control

518
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:42,240
is it Butter's good for us oh dear Lord

519
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:45,240
oh my God Trend fat fads and

520
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:47,640
Trends you got to laugh a little bit you

521
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:49,320
can't get too upset about it all even

522
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:52,679
though people's lives are always you

523
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:54,600
know involved and at risk and you know

524
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:56,159
people sufferings involved but you can't

525
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:58,559
you can't you can't these Trends you

526
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:00,360
can't let these Trends make you too

527
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:04,480
crazy you have to kind of laugh about it

528
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:05,840
a little bit the butter thing so so when

529
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,559
you're thinking about putting butter in

530
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:10,200
your in your drink in the morning in

531
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:11,799
your hot drink in the morning or you're

532
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:14,080
thinking about you know whatever

533
00:21:11,799 --> 00:21:15,480
thinking it's healthy just think again

534
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,880
because your liver doesn't like it and

535
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:18,039
your heart's not going to like it and if

536
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,799
you're young and you don't have high

537
00:21:18,039 --> 00:21:21,760
blood pressure and you want to have

538
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:23,600
butter and you want to live in the

539
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,760
moment okay but you know what remember

540
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:28,240
the show 20 years from

541
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,480
now remember the show 20 years from now

542
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,840
when you're

543
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:35,960
40 remember the show 20 years from now

544
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:38,240
when you're 50 okay so here's the

545
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:39,600
deal it's not just about cleaning up the

546
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,240
liver or anything like that it's about

547
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,559
getting the diet right so the heart

548
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:44,960
doesn't have to pump so hard look if you

549
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:46,279
don't have high blood pressure or if you

550
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,600
don't have a blood pressure problem at

551
00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:51,360
all then don't even D just okay fine you

552
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:53,159
don't have to worry just move on but you

553
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:55,240
should listen to it and you should learn

554
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:57,799
cuz it's important it is important so

555
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:59,760
you can look out for a loved one or look

556
00:21:57,799 --> 00:22:03,440
out for yourself in the

557
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:05,360
future so when that blood gets thick and

558
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,640
pasty and

559
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:10,799
dehydrated and the heart has to work

560
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:14,880
harder it strains the heart it strains

561
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:17,360
it and it causes veins to have such a

562
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:20,679
suction to it that the veins they

563
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:24,080
tighten up they tighten up they don't

564
00:22:20,679 --> 00:22:26,480
collapse in but they they

565
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:30,240
constrict they constrict because of the

566
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:32,360
suction the pole so the veins constrict

567
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,919
makes it even more

568
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:39,039
difficult and less oxygen even gets to

569
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:43,120
the liver which in turn less oxygen gets

570
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:45,720
to the heart gets to the

571
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,679
heart something to be cons something to

572
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:50,039
understand something to consider

573
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:55,919
something to know the heart wants free

574
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:58,600
and clear fresh clean blood

575
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:02,400
hydrated the right water content

576
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:07,960
content the right minerals the right

577
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:11,000
nutrients it wants blood that's like a

578
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:13,320
waterfall in the Amazon that you would

579
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,799
that you would dream of you know you

580
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:18,279
would dream of of being in that water

581
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:20,240
while the water's coming down even

582
00:23:18,279 --> 00:23:22,600
though there's serpents in that water

583
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,760
like some dangerous snakes down there

584
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:28,159
and out there in the Amazon like the

585
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:29,440
fertil an snake the fertil an thing F

586
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:32,720
you you're

587
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:34,279
dead man you just you know people they

588
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,279
go on these trips and they go into the

589
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:38,679
Amazon and they go to South America or

590
00:23:36,279 --> 00:23:42,159
they go in other places around the world

591
00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:44,440
and and you know in different different

592
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:46,159
different areas of the world and they

593
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:47,799
want to be playing in that nice little

594
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:49,799
swimming hole with that water coming

595
00:23:47,799 --> 00:23:52,679
down and all those Vines going around

596
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:54,080
you get bit by a ferti an snake man it

597
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:57,440
happens all the

598
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:58,840
time yeah I know I'm a downer I'm a

599
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,320
downer

600
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:04,320
but I'm all about looking out for you

601
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:06,159
I'm all about looking out for you okay

602
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,480
so the heart wants us clean blood

603
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:09,039
because it has to work harder when it

604
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:10,640
works harder you get a elevated blood

605
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:12,600
pressure doctor looks at you there's no

606
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,520
cardiovascular disease diagnoses you

607
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:16,559
with hypertension so you get diagnosed

608
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:18,760
as you know

609
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:20,039
hypertension if you ask the doctor why

610
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:21,480
is it the doctor says well I don't know

611
00:24:20,039 --> 00:24:23,000
your diet's not so bad I don't see any

612
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,559
cardiovascular problems maybe you just

613
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,200
need to exercise get your diet a little

614
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:28,440
bit better maybe do a little bit more

615
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:30,399
high protein which is wrong

616
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:32,440
but maybe do a little high protein knock

617
00:24:30,399 --> 00:24:35,159
out the sugar well yeah knock out the

618
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:37,799
sugar is right not the fruit not the

619
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:41,000
sweet potatoes not the yams not the

620
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:43,039
winter squash not the regular potatoes

621
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:47,440
you don't knock any of that out that's

622
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:51,399
just blatant stupidity in the world of

623
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:53,640
Trends right now trendy junk science

624
00:24:51,399 --> 00:24:56,320
trendy junk science someone said to me

625
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:58,279
and said wait a minute here your books

626
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,240
are filled with science

627
00:24:58,279 --> 00:25:02,039
I said ' huh and somebody said your

628
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,240
books are filled with science all your

629
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:07,600
books it's just it's all

630
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:10,320
science I go it's all from Spirit it's

631
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:12,360
undiscovered science and they go okay

632
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:15,279
wait a minute but it's not it's not like

633
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:17,720
peer-reviewed science I go why would I

634
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:19,399
want that that's junk science I don't

635
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:21,360
want my books filled with junk science

636
00:25:19,399 --> 00:25:22,919
no one would have gotten better or maybe

637
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:25,720
a handful got better and then I would

638
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:28,320
have to heral Herald them as as the the

639
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:29,640
poster the poster people

640
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,880
because you know what it's there's a

641
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:33,120
difference when you get tens of

642
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,559
thousands of people better and healed

643
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:38,240
and better from your books than just

644
00:25:35,559 --> 00:25:40,799
getting a few and then trying to exalt

645
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:43,240
that and and use that as your poster

646
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:44,919
board I said you know yeah no it's not

647
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:46,600
fill the junk I don't want junk science

648
00:25:44,919 --> 00:25:49,679
in there it's from

649
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:51,880
Spirit yeah there's a big difference big

650
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:53,640
difference so what happens is when

651
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:56,559
you're told that you need more high

652
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:58,480
protein and to avoid fruit and avoid

653
00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:01,159
fruit and sweet potato Poes and avoid

654
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:03,320
yams and avoid regular potatoes and

655
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:06,320
avoid other things like this and avoid

656
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:07,520
raw honey when you're told to avoid all

657
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:10,200
those

658
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:12,240
things because of junk science it is

659
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:14,760
junk science you see how it works I mean

660
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:17,279
because you're not supposed to avoid

661
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:18,760
apples you're not supposed to avoid all

662
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:21,039
the different good fruits you're not

663
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:22,840
supposed to avoid bananas no you're not

664
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:25,159
it's the greatest food to keep your

665
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:26,559
blood clean it's the greatest food for

666
00:26:25,159 --> 00:26:28,120
the heart guess what your heart is do

667
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:31,520
you know what your heart is

668
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:34,840
your heart is a muscle it's a muscle

669
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:37,039
guess what a muscle needs a carbohydrate

670
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:41,520
you know what happens if we starve a

671
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:43,640
muscle of sugar it dies it atrophies if

672
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:45,760
you starve a muscle of sugar it

673
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:48,360
atrophies did you know I have seen

674
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:50,960
people over the years go on a no sugar

675
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:52,480
diet completely no sugar at all nothing

676
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,480
at all no sugar at all these were a lot

677
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,960
of bad trendy diets that were no sugar

678
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,360
at all not even a berry put in there not

679
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,360
even an apple Apple put in there not

680
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:03,120
even a green apple did you know their

681
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:05,320
hearts atrophied because they're on

682
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:07,640
animal protein only and a few assorted

683
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:09,559
vegetables and they didn't get enough

684
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:12,640
carbohydrate to their heart and their

685
00:27:09,559 --> 00:27:16,360
brain their heart though being a muscle

686
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:18,279
atrophied so they atrophied their hearts

687
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:22,240
they atrophied their hearts on the

688
00:27:18,279 --> 00:27:24,600
trendy trendy high protein no sugar diet

689
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:27,640
their hearts atrophied because their

690
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:29,880
hearts are a muscle and they require a

691
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:31,960
lot of carbohydrate a tremendous amount

692
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:34,679
of carbohydrate in

693
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:37,640
Sugar you take a carbohydrate away from

694
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:39,799
a marathon runner put a marathon runner

695
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:43,559
on high protein in a few vegetables and

696
00:27:39,799 --> 00:27:45,039
never give them one single gram of sugar

697
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:46,720
put a put a marathon runner on that

698
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:49,640
we'll see how good his game goes or her

699
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:51,840
game goes be a

700
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:53,760
disaster but what happens is protein

701
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:55,440
bars are filled with sugar no one

702
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,679
realizes that they're filled with sugar

703
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,159
so when you're eating protein bars

704
00:27:56,679 --> 00:27:59,880
you're getting sugar so at least you can

705
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:02,279
run your Marathon because you got sugar

706
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:04,880
going in you even if you're told to stay

707
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:07,720
off of all sugar it's just

708
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:10,320
bizarre your heart has to have a

709
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:12,519
carbohydrate every cell in the heart a

710
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:15,880
sugar has to enter it in order to keep

711
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:15,880
it alive thriving and non-

712
00:28:16,039 --> 00:28:21,200
atrophying you have to remember that

713
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:23,159
that's how critical it is your liers

714
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,120
filled the glucose it stores the

715
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:27,720
glycogen to keep you safe and keep your

716
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:29,399
adrenal safe if you don't eat the right

717
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:32,960
fruits and the right sweet potatoes and

718
00:28:29,399 --> 00:28:35,919
if you want to be a raw dude if you want

719
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:37,840
to be a raw dude then you just do all

720
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:39,760
raw fruits raw fruits and lots of leafy

721
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,120
greens and vegetables and the whole bit

722
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,240
and you can do some nuts and seeds and

723
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,159
you can do things like that and all of

724
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,080
it you got to be careful you don't

725
00:28:43,159 --> 00:28:46,799
overdo the nuts and seeds you want to be

726
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,919
vegetarian you got to do lots of fruits

727
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:50,480
you know I tell

728
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:52,000
vegetarians I tell vegetarians why don't

00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:56,600
plant-based and and you know when I tell

732
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,279
animal I tell paleo people and high

00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,880
animal protein people people there I say

734
00:28:58,279 --> 00:29:01,600
look you're already now bringing in a

735
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:03,240
green juice for the first time you

736
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:05,399
because of because the trendy diet is

737
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:08,039
Shifting now because they the trendy

738
00:29:05,399 --> 00:29:10,919
diets right now are stealing from the

739
00:29:08,039 --> 00:29:13,360
alternative model it's hilarious to see

740
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:15,960
it from standing away from it you guys

741
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:17,440
might not see it because it you know I I

742
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:19,279
could stand away from it and see it

743
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,840
because I don't hold the belief system

744
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:23,039
and a lot of people they hold the belief

745
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:24,919
system and what happens is the belief

746
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:27,760
system blinds them so they can't stand

747
00:29:24,919 --> 00:29:30,240
away from it I can stand away and see

748
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:32,440
that the conventional movement in the

749
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:34,720
diet world all the experts now they

750
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:37,039
robbed and theft it and

751
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,880
stole alternative things that were

752
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:40,360
critical to Healing people so

753
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,679
alternative movement healed a lot of

754
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,880
people over the years too I mean there's

755
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:44,880
a lot of people that healed a lot of

756
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:47,240
great alternative stuff and one of the

757
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:50,399
reasons why what healed them was a lot

758
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:52,000
of the juicing a lot of the vegetables a

759
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:53,559
lot of leafy greens and fruits and stuff

760
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,039
like that and that you know a lot of the

761
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:57,360
plant-based

762
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:59,679
movement that did a lot for people

763
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:01,399
people so what happened was the animal

764
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:03,159
protein people in The Last 5 Years the

765
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:05,399
experts putting out their books now they

766
00:30:03,159 --> 00:30:07,679
they're robbing and thefting those green

767
00:30:05,399 --> 00:30:10,120
juices they're incorporating them into

768
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:11,360
their their trendy high-fat diets and

769
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:13,480
they're noticing people are getting a

770
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:15,200
little bit better so what I tell is that

771
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:17,799
you know I tell the Paleo crowd the high

772
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:20,559
protein crowd you're already there you

773
00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:23,039
got now the green juice in there Bravo

774
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:25,480
you got the green juice in there now and

775
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:26,919
you got more leafy greens in there now

776
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:28,440
just lower the animal protein a little

777
00:30:26,919 --> 00:30:29,919
bit more for your liver and your heart

778
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:31,120
you can still keep your animal proteins

779
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:32,799
in there if you really want but just

780
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,519
lower them down a little bit and I tell

781
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:37,080
the vegetarians look you're already

782
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:39,039
there get rid of the cheese you're

783
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:41,120
already you're almost plant-based get

784
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:43,360
rid of the cheese you don't eat red meat

785
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:45,640
get rid of the cheese and get rid of the

786
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:47,399
eggs and they're like I don't know

00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:55,080

all those eggs you're already there you

795
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:05,720
should be going plant-based if that's

796
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:07,320
where you want to go and the high

797
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:08,639
protein people look you're already there

798
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:10,559
the high protein paleo people you

799
00:31:08,639 --> 00:31:11,960
already got in you're already getting in

800
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:13,919
the juices you're already getting in

801
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:16,360
more leafy greens and and and more

802
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:18,600
berries and more berries in a green

803
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:20,120
apple why don't you bring in a little

804
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,919
bit more of that and just lower your

805
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:23,760
animal protein a little bit do it once a

806
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:26,039
day so you can save your liver and your

807
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:27,639
heart when you step back and you don't

808
00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:29,080
have a belief system you know what you

809
00:31:27,639 --> 00:31:30,760
can do for people and you know what's

810
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:33,200
right because you know when you don't

811
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:35,639
have that belief system you can you can

812
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:38,440
navigate you can

813
00:31:35,639 --> 00:31:40,600
navigate and that's the gift Spirit gave

814
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:42,200
me you know Spirit told me when I was

815
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:44,039
younger Spirit was like you're going to

816
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:45,480
be able to navigate I'm going to give

817
00:31:44,039 --> 00:31:46,399
you the information you're going to be

818
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:50,600
able to

819
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:53,600
navigate and I love that so all right so

820
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:55,639
here's the deal the heart's a muscle it

821
00:31:53,600 --> 00:32:00,080
needs a carbohydrate you got to be

822
00:31:55,639 --> 00:32:01,799
cautious you can't high fat your blood

823
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,919
with so much fat that means if you're

824
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:06,880
plant-based you can't be doing nutcakes

825
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:10,200
and nut pies 247 you got to be doing

826
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:12,159
lots of fruit plant-based and lots of

827
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:13,760
leafy greens when you're plant-based you

828
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:15,200
could still have some hem seeds and some

829
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,799
walnuts and you can still do what you

830
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,919
want to do there you have some avocado

831
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:20,919
of course you can but you got to keep

832
00:32:18,919 --> 00:32:23,039
your fats low like I said with the VAR

833
00:32:20,919 --> 00:32:25,159
vegetarians just get rid of the eggs and

834
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:27,440
dairy like I said with the high high

835
00:32:25,159 --> 00:32:28,960
protein people limit it to one protein

836
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:31,039
or something and go every other day with

837
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:34,200
an animal protein in this way you can

838
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:37,120
get your blood less fatty your heart

839
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:39,360
works less hard your liver works less

840
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:42,639
hard your blood gets cleaner it gets

841
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:45,480
more hydrated it gets a better quality

842
00:32:42,639 --> 00:32:47,559
of blood going in there oxygen rises in

843
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:49,279
the blood when the blood's rushing to

844
00:32:47,559 --> 00:32:52,440
the liver through the hepatic portal

845
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:54,519
vein it's alive it's got less poisons

846
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:58,159
and toxins in it it's got more water

847
00:32:54,519 --> 00:33:00,240
molecules and it has more of everything

848
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:02,600
oxygen included it goes to the liver the

849
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:05,039
liver starts to heal the heart works

850
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:06,720
less and all the fruits you're adding

851
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:08,200
into your diet and the sweet potatoes

852
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,880
and the winter squash and even the

853
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:11,679
regular potatoes you're adding into your

854
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:13,600
diet with your leafy greens and

855
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:15,840
everything else you're doing gets your

856
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:18,360
heart to get that precious glycogen

857
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:20,679
storage the glucose I mean glucose into

858
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:23,080
the cells of the heart the liver has the

859
00:33:20,679 --> 00:33:25,559
glycogen storage the heart gets cells

860
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:28,279
gets sugar right directly into every

861
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:30,720
cell and the Heart Won't atrophy and it

862
00:33:28,279 --> 00:33:34,000
stays strong so when it has to work hard

863
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:36,039
and pump thick nasty blood it doesn't

864
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,159
weaken it stays strong too that's

865
00:33:36,039 --> 00:33:40,799
another thing and then you start you

866
00:33:39,159 --> 00:33:42,320
you'll see the blood pressure go down

867
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:44,279
the doctor be like I don't know why your

868
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:46,120
blood your blood pressure went down

869
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:47,639
let's take you off the medication well

870
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:51,000
you you need less blood pressure

871
00:33:47,639 --> 00:33:52,440
medication and less or don't even use

872
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,600
the blood pressure medication let's just

873
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:55,159
see where we're going it's getting

874
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:57,679
better and better and

875
00:33:55,159 --> 00:34:01,120
better what's going on Mr Jones are you

876
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:03,799
exercising and and eating more red meat

877
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:05,279
no what I'm doing is cleaning up my

878
00:34:03,799 --> 00:34:07,679
blood getting my liver a little better

879
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:09,960
and giving my heart a

880
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:11,720
break and you get better and that's the

881
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:13,919
mystery of high blood

882
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:16,040
pressure that's the mystery high blood

883
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:17,639
pressure celery juice is a miracle for

884
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:19,359
blood pressure I know that there's a lot

885
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:20,919
of people that are worried about ah my

886
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:22,359
blood pressure is too low I can't drink

887
00:34:20,919 --> 00:34:25,280
celery juice my blood pressure is too

888
00:34:22,359 --> 00:34:28,679
low can't drink it I can't drink it not

889
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:33,119
true Did You Know that celery juice

890
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:35,760
balances blood pressure balances no one

891
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:39,280
knows this once again because of trendy

892
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:42,359
Miss information or recycled theories

893
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:45,079
going around out there no one has it

894
00:34:42,359 --> 00:34:47,000
right is why I read the that's why I

895
00:34:45,079 --> 00:34:48,760
read the beginning of the show like I do

896
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
and I say what I do I probably drives

897
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:52,960
you crazy when I do that in front of

898
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,359
every show there's a reason cuz no one

899
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:57,680
has it right it's

900
00:34:55,359 --> 00:35:02,320
painful it's pain

901
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:06,280
painful to see it celery juice is a

902
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:09,119
blood stabilizer balancer it's

903
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:11,560
adaptogenic for the body what happens is

904
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:15,040
if your blood pressure is low celery

905
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:20,040
juice can raise it if your blood

906
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:24,079
pressure is high celery juice can lower

907
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:25,440
it see just just just walk this walk

908
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:26,560
through this with me I know because a

909
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,839
lot of people who have low blood

910
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:31,000
pressure they're they're totally

911
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:33,480
paranoid about the

912
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,200
celery and then you know what they'll go

913
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:37,520
and eat something

914
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:41,280
ridiculous they'll eat

915
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:43,880
eggs me they'll eat eggs I see it all

916
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:46,160
the time I mean I even see it on social

917
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:48,040
media I see it all the time out there

918
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:50,839
it's like no no I can't do celery juice

919
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:53,630
I got low BL low blood pressure and they

920
00:35:50,839 --> 00:35:55,800
got they eat two eggs that

921
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:58,800
[Laughter]

922
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,800
day

923
00:35:58,839 --> 00:36:04,240
seriously all right so anyway so I got

924
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:07,079
to walk through it with you again the

925
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:12,160
celery juice raises blood pressure when

926
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:14,480
it's low it it St it's a

927
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:16,079
stabilizer because what happens with low

928
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,720
blood pressure people they have a

929
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:19,720
different problem with their liver they

930
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:22,160
have a whole entire different problem if

931
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:24,160
they don't have a leak somewhere if they

932
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:26,280
don't have a valve leak if they don't

933
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:28,640
have a ventricle leak if they don't have

934
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:29,800
something like that going on and a

935
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,839
doctor I mean we're talking about low

936
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,800
blood pressure I'm talking about low

937
00:36:30,839 --> 00:36:35,480
blood pressure and a doctor that ran

938
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:38,640
every test in the book can't find a

939
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:40,440
physical physical aspect to why they

940
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,920
have low blood pressure so they have to

941
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:44,839
come up with all these autoimmune

942
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:46,599
theories or the body's just confused or

943
00:36:44,839 --> 00:36:48,400
you're it's genetic you know maybe

944
00:36:46,599 --> 00:36:49,680
somebody in your ancestry had low blood

945
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,599
pressure they have to come up with all

946
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:53,400
that crap that junk science feeds

947
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:57,640
doctors so doctors have some kind of

948
00:36:53,400 --> 00:37:01,040
answer and so all that

949
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:03,720
involved all that

950
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:05,839
involved and then you know what happens

951
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:07,800
there massive confusion and so when

952
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:09,160
someone someone has this kind of low

953
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,760
blood pressure they don't know where to

954
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:13,119
go what is it what really does this

955
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:14,760
what's happening what they have going on

956
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:17,480
is a whole different problem they got a

957
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:20,760
viral issue that's a viral issue low

958
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:23,119
blood pressure people have a viral issue

959
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:24,760
that's what they do and they have a

960
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:26,240
little bit of an adrenal dysfunction

961
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:28,040
along with it even if they don't have

962
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:30,240
the fat fatigue they have a little bit

963
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:33,079
of an adrenal

964
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:35,240
function issue and they're they're and

965
00:37:33,079 --> 00:37:38,560
they have a viral issue too that's what

966
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:39,800
low blood pressure people have and it's

967
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:43,240
a

968
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:44,599
virus and that that's what happens there

969
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:46,200
so this is what happens when you have a

970
00:37:44,599 --> 00:37:48,640
low-grade virus a lot of people have

971
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:50,160
different varieties of lowgrade viruses

972
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:52,440
and there's nothing wrong with that

973
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:54,960
perfectly fine perfectly fine there's

974
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:57,440
nothing wrong with that but a few things

975
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:59,079
occur as the virus releases certain

976
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:01,560
types of poisons and certain types of

977
00:37:59,079 --> 00:38:03,440
poisons are recognized by the

978
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:06,560
body the

979
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:08,560
heart does something a little different

980
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:11,520
because the heart doesn't want to be

981
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:14,480
pumping lots and lots of poison really

982
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:16,480
hard and fast throughout the body so the

983
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:19,160
brain gets saturated with

984
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:20,560
it so the body's communicating with self

985
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,920
the brain's communicating with the heart

986
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:23,599
the liver's communicating with the heart

987
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,119
the brain's communicating with the liver

988
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:27,000
they're all communicating together and

989
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:29,160
even the thyroids communicating with all

990
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:31,880
that so with all that together

991
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:35,119
communicating low blood pressure occurs

992
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:38,280
because of a toxic load a toxic load

993
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:40,040
that the body's being systematically

994
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:43,200
cautious

995
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:44,800
about that means that if the if if if

996
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:47,000
the heart for instance somebody with low

997
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:49,119
blood pressure if they exercise the

998
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,960
people with low blood pressure usually

999
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:53,200
have other symptoms develop or they had

1000
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,560
symptoms before their low blood blood

1001
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:56,520
low blood pressure and they're dealing

1002
00:38:54,560 --> 00:39:00,200
with lowgrade problems low grade

1003
00:38:56,520 --> 00:39:01,720
symptoms fatigue a little bit of fatigue

1004
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:03,440
they're dealing with things where they

1005
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:05,240
they if they exercise they're they're

1006
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:07,480
like wasted for a few days they don't

1007
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:09,040
feel good all these kinds of different

1008
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:10,599
things happen with people at low blood

1009
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:12,000
pressure then they get diagnosed with

1010
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:15,599
all these different things they can get

1011
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:17,319
diagnosed with dis with dis aonia dis

1012
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:19,000
aonia you and that's a whole thing that

1013
00:39:17,319 --> 00:39:20,280
can happen too they can get diagnosed

1014
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,720
with different varieties of that you

1015
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:24,640
know pots whatever they can get they the

1016
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:28,079
whole thing with blood pressure but it's

1017
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:29,880
viral it's 100% viral and sometimes

1018
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:31,960
adrenals get underactive because of the

1019
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:34,079
viral issue sometimes the virus is

1020
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:36,040
sitting in the liver that's usually

1021
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:39,800
where it sits it doesn't mean the liver

1022
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:42,680
is so clogged or so toxic where the

1023
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:44,640
heart has to work harder it's just that

1024
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:47,480
there's communication within the body

1025
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:49,079
the brain the heart liver thyroid the

1026
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:51,319
adrenals just communication going on

1027
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:53,160
through the whole body and is the

1028
00:39:51,319 --> 00:39:54,480
low-grade virus you get the low this is

1029
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:56,160
the same thing with people that get real

1030
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,079
low temperatures they got a low grade

1031
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,640
virus

1032
00:39:57,079 --> 00:40:00,200
so you gets people that are like oh my

1033
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:05,440
God I'm actually

1034
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:09,480
95.9 de I'm not 86 I am not

1035
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:09,920
88.6 88.6 I'm not 98.6 sorry about that

1036
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,680
you

1037
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:17,200
[Laughter]

1038
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:19,200
guys I'm not 98.6 degrees I'm

1039
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:22,280
96.4

1040
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:24,000
degrees how is that possible that's what

1041
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:25,319
people that people they all freak out

1042
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,720
when they get their when they finally

1043
00:40:25,319 --> 00:40:27,920
take their temperatures or they the

1044
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,200
doctor takes their temperature and the

1045
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:34,000
doctor's like doctor's office like

1046
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:36,040
you're 96.7 de you're supposed to be

1047
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,319
98.6 first of all not everybody's

1048
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:40,119
supposed to be

1049
00:40:37,319 --> 00:40:42,560
98.6 a lot of people are supposed to be

1050
00:40:40,119 --> 00:40:44,920
97 in the 97s I'm just telling you right

1051
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:46,760
now but there's people that they're

1052
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:49,640
literally in the

1053
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:52,520
96s and because of that that's a low

1054
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:55,000
that's a low grade viral infection

1055
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:56,680
there's no fever but that's a low- grade

1056
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:59,200
viral infection that's what that that is

1057
00:40:56,680 --> 00:41:00,680
inside the liver and inside the body

1058
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:02,400
it's the same thing with the low blood

1059
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:05,119
pressure the mystery low blood pressure

1060
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:06,839
I'm not talking about an actual real

1061
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:08,960
physical condition discovered by the

1062
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:11,440
doctors talking about mystery low blood

1063
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:13,599
pressure there there's a low-grade virus

1064
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:15,319
causing that too it's very similar most

1065
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:16,920
people with the mystery low blood

1066
00:41:15,319 --> 00:41:18,000
pressure have a very low temperature

1067
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:21,480
especially in the

1068
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:23,520
morning in the morning and even at night

1069
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:25,040
even at night too or in the middle of

1070
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,440
the day you can do I've seen it in the

1071
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:28,040
middle of the day people's temperatures

1072
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:29,520
drop seen it in the morning right when

1073
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:30,960
they get up their temperature drop

1074
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,839
seeing it even at the end of the day or

1075
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:34,800
the evening which usually is when it

1076
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:36,560
goes up for the most part but it's

1077
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:39,160
usually I guess morning and and

1078
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:41,319
afternoon and there's a lowgrade viral

1079
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:42,960
thing going on in the system and there's

1080
00:41:41,319 --> 00:41:45,880
a communication going on with the whole

1081
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:48,640
body because what happens is if if that

1082
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:50,800
if that Blood starts rushing with

1083
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:53,359
because the body's on alert it's on

1084
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:55,240
alert if the blood starts rushing it you

1085
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:57,040
know it the body's concerned about

1086
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:58,400
poisons and toxins going into certain

1087
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:00,000
places like the brain the liver is

1088
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:02,960
concerned it's going to go to the BL

1089
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,760
brain organs have communicate first of

1090
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,920
all have to know this organs communicate

1091
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:07,599
they communicate with each other and

1092
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:09,440
they have high intelligence level

1093
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:10,920
extremely high intelligence level

1094
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:12,599
intelligence we can't even think about

1095
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:14,440
or understand or know about science of

1096
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:15,680
research has no idea how the liver

1097
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:17,560
communicates with the brain how the

1098
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:19,720
brain communicates with the liver how it

1099
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:21,319
works how the heart communicates there's

1100
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:22,920
communication going on all the time it's

1101
00:42:21,319 --> 00:42:24,640
not just the brain's giving orders

1102
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:26,640
through nerves and making nerve function

1103
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:28,319
happen and making organs do with their

1104
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:29,880
that's not it at all it's way more than

1105
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:31,720
that if we think it's not more than that

1106
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:34,480
then we're just ridiculous because it's

1107
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:36,160
way more than that we're in just Deni if

1108
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:38,359
we don't if we don't know

1109
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:40,480
that and so that's another that's

1110
00:42:38,359 --> 00:42:42,280
another thing that happens plus you can

1111
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:44,200
have somebody with different kinds of um

1112
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:45,359
low-grade viral issues and they'll have

1113
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:47,480
their adrenals will be really

1114
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:50,000
underactive they'll have underactive

1115
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:52,079
adrenals that that itself will cause low

1116
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:55,200
blood pressure underactive

1117
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:57,280
adrenals that itself so when you have

1118
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:58,880
underactive adrenals you have a viral

1119
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:00,599
situation in the body you can you can

1120
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:03,440
get the low blood

1121
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:04,720
pressure so that that all that that's

1122
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,760
these are just some of the reasons for

1123
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:08,599
low blood

1124
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:10,240
pressure also there's a lot of people

1125
00:43:08,599 --> 00:43:12,640
that are supposed to have lower blood

1126
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:14,040
pressure there's there's a lot of people

1127
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:16,760
out there that are supposed to have

1128
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:18,480
lower low not super low not super low

1129
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:20,040
but they're supposed to be their blood

1130
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:22,480
pressure is supposed to be

1131
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:24,640
lower it's who they are it's just it's

1132
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:27,200
it's natural and guess what it's not a

1133
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:30,079
bad thing it's just when you go past the

1134
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:32,520
limitations of low and you're in another

1135
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:34,359
another level of low that's when there's

1136
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:36,800
this low-grade viral infection you can

1137
00:43:34,359 --> 00:43:38,400
be in a normal low blood pressure where

1138
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:40,839
it's actually healthy and good and and

1139
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:43,359
and but yet a little extra

1140
00:43:40,839 --> 00:43:45,760
low and and there's nothing wrong with

1141
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:48,520
that also another thing to understand

1142
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:52,079
someone with low blood pressure in the

1143
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:54,640
super low Zone With lowgrade viral stuff

1144
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:56,640
it doesn't hurt the heart it doesn't

1145
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:59,280
hurt the heart

1146
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:01,520
and and and really it honestly when you

1147
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:02,880
work on cleaning up the viral stuff and

1148
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:04,680
you work on cleaning up the liver and

1149
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:06,599
you work on cleaning up your body and

1150
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:09,079
healing you

1151
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:10,680
know people with low low low low blood

1152
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:12,319
PR blood pressure have the Epstein bar

1153
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:14,800
virus they have the Epstein bar virus

1154
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:17,000
but they have they it's a certain

1155
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:19,480
variety of Epstein

1156
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,440
bar and so that's that's a big part of

1157
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:23,119
that but once you heal and move forward

1158
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,520
that that that blood pressure will come

1159
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:26,079
up and it'll come up and you'll get it a

1160
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:27,200
little better and a little better a

1161
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:28,920
little better you can't be afraid of

1162
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:31,599
celery juice CU you got low blood

1163
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:32,520
pressure low celery juice will help lift

1164
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:36,000
it

1165
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:37,640
up will help lift it up so that's just a

1166
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,119
massive confusion right there so what do

1167
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:41,520
we do let's just go with the m first of

1168
00:44:40,119 --> 00:44:43,760
all let's talk about the we'll talk

1169
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:45,839
about the mystery the mystery high blood

1170
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:48,119
pressure got to lower your fats and you

1171
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:50,119
got to ease the burden off your liver so

1172
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:52,440
that's one thing got to lower your fats

1173
00:44:50,119 --> 00:44:54,480
and ease the burden off your liver so

1174
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:56,480
that's really important it's stopping

1175
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:59,000
your blood from being so thick not

1176
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:01,920
letting your blood get so thick and and

1177
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:03,280
dirty and that's what you have to do so

1178
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:05,880
you already know the diet whole thing

1179
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:07,119
with the diet with you know with a diet

1180
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:09,280
with the uh if you want to be animal

1181
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:10,880
protein you got to bring it down to one

1182
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:12,880
you know one serving a day or every

1183
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:14,720
other day you can still be an animal

1184
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:16,440
protein person just bring in more of all

1185
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:18,119
the other things I talked about more of

1186
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:19,760
the fruits the vegetables can't be

1187
00:45:18,119 --> 00:45:22,000
afraid of all the different fruits

1188
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:24,160
they're all there for a reason don't

1189
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:26,040
walk past the fruit section because

1190
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:29,200
you're being told somewhere that it's

1191
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:30,960
not it's not good for you you can you

1192
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:33,920
can eat some oranges there's no reason

1193
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:36,240
why you can't get an orange I mean it's

1194
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:38,880
longevity food that's what it is you're

1195
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:40,960
passing the longevity section of the

1196
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:43,599
market when you go past the produce

1197
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:45,880
aisle you're P meaning you're passing

1198
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:48,440
the fruit section then that means you're

1199
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:51,160
passing the longevity section that's

1200
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:55,319
that's literally a decision you're

1201
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:58,119
making because of trendy Mis you know

1202
00:45:55,319 --> 00:46:01,359
Mis Mis guided information so you're

1203
00:45:58,119 --> 00:46:03,040
you're walking past that aisle you just

1204
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:05,839
you don't want to just grab a pint of

1205
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:07,760

learning about it more and grabbing

1217
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:33,520

get the celery juices for high blood

1221
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:41,640
pressure it's great for the it's it's

1222
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:44,440
honestly it's like a liver cure that's

1223
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:46,200
the celery juice is and so you want to

1224
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:47,800
go you want to go get the celery juice

1225
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:50,480
pick up some cucumbers for cucumber

1226
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:52,920
juice too you can do that you know you

1227
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:54,720
can that would be amazing grab your

1228
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:56,720
spinach in the aisle why not grab more

1229
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:58,640
spinach CU you can do spinach salads get

1230
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:59,599
a couple of avocados absolutely get a

1231
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:02,640
couple of

1232
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:04,559
avocados definitely have a big spinach

1233
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:06,559
salad throw an avocado in it that would

1234
00:47:04,559 --> 00:47:08,720
be better than a salad with two eggs in

1235
00:47:06,559 --> 00:47:10,720
it hard-boiled eggs in it I promise you

1236
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:13,000
that having that avocado in that salad

1237
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:14,599
would be a th million times better than

1238
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:17,640
having two eggs in there two heart

1239
00:47:14,599 --> 00:47:18,839
killing eggs to I you know I love where

1240
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:20,559
it's like all of a sudden you know an

1241
00:47:18,839 --> 00:47:22,040
egg is a perfect food and it's it's got

1242
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:24,040
all these Omega-3s and it's heart

1243
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:26,400
healthy I I've never seen anything so

1244
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:29,359
demented in my life because it's not

1245
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:31,800
it's not don't get fooled by that unless

1246
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:33,599
it's the only food you got yes there's

1247
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:35,480
some nutrients and eggs yeah there's

1248
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:37,839
some vitamins and eggs yeah there's

1249
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:42,160
there's in some eggs there's an omega-3

1250
00:47:37,839 --> 00:47:45,599
in there yeah in the healthier eggs of

1251
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:48,000
course but that's nothing that's nothing

1252
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:50,079
compared to what an avocado has and it's

1253
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:53,119
nothing compared to juicing celery juice

1254
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:55,319
has nothing compared to sweet potatoes

1255
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:57,119
have I mean they haven't even tapped

1256
00:47:55,319 --> 00:47:58,880
into what's in a sweet potato yet

1257
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:00,240
because no one wants to spend the money

1258
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:01,640
research and science doesn't want to

1259
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:03,559
know what's in a sweet potato cuz it's

1260
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:05,359
going to make people buy more of

1261
00:48:03,559 --> 00:48:07,280
them and then you know what they're

1262
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:08,559
going to see doctors less and women are

1263
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:11,119
going to see doctors less because

1264
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:12,760
they're eating their sweet potatoes said

1265
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:15,119
they don't want the research of science

1266
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:16,160
doesn't want you eating sweet potatoes

1267
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:18,480
no

1268
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:22,800
way why why why would they want you to

1269
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:24,559
do that so you know it's about lowering

1270
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:25,720
your fats though at the same time so

1271
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:27,480
that means you could still do some

1272
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:29,200
healthy fats like the avocado some hem

1273
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:31,400
seeds some some walnuts and stuff like

1274
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:33,000
throw walnuts in a salad absolutely you

1275
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:34,640
can still do these have a little bit of

1276
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:37,319
olive oil if you really

1277
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:39,160
want but just don't overdo it don't

1278
00:48:37,319 --> 00:48:40,839
overdo it and get more of the fresh

1279
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:43,520
fruits and vegetables and you're you'll

1280
00:48:40,839 --> 00:48:46,839
see your high blood pressure come down

1281

you'll see it come down you really will

1282
00:48:46,839 --> 00:48:51,119
get on some magnesium I think that would

1283
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:52,520
be great for you get on some magnesium

1284
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:54,160
without a doubt I like the Magnesium

1285
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:55,760
glycinate I feel like it works really

1286
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:57,000
good I know it works Spirit tells me it

1287
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:59,480
works I've given it to people over the

1288
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:01,680
years I like magnesium glycinate that

1289
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:03,599
that one works natural Cal is okay you

1290
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:06,760
know that's all right just make sure you

1291
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:08,520
pour hot water into the cup when you put

1292
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:10,040
a teaspoon of natural c in there or two

1293
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:11,480
teaspoons of natural C make sure you

1294
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:13,079
pour you know really like you were going

1295
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:16,760
to make a hot cup of tea you pour the

1296
00:49:13,079 --> 00:49:19,240
water in there because by doing that it

1297
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:21,680
uh it it it really activates it the

1298
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:23,000
right way makes it better so if you

1299
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:26,200

1308
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:43,119
pressure for people with low blood

1309
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:46,000

1312
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:52,960
people with the low blood pressure that

00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:01,040
issues those people with low blood

1318
00:49:59,839 --> 00:50:03,839
pressure you might want to consider

1319
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:06,200
doing ashwagandha that would be really

1320
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:09,079
good you might even want to consider

1321
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:11,119
doing licorice I think licorice would be

1322
00:50:09,079 --> 00:50:13,280
fantastic for the people with low blood

1323
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:14,520
pressure I mean talk to your doctor talk

1324
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:15,960
to your practitioner about it but I

1325
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:17,920
would do licorice root you could do

1326
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:19,680
licorice tea every single day or go to

1327
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:21,040

1328
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:23,640
get the right licorice

1329
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:26,240
tincture the one without

1330
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:28,319
alcohol which is a bon IED mess that

1331
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:30,319
alcohols in tinctures that's that's just

1332
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:32,400
that's terrible that's terrible it's

1333
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:33,680
travesty all on its own so make sure

1334
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:35,480
that you you know you get the licorish

1335
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:37,160

great nettle leaf tea that's also pretty

1339
00:50:42,119 --> 00:50:47,480
good but the licorice root is great so

1340
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:49,319
