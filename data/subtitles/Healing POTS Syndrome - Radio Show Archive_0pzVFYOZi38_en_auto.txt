[0.80 - 10.92] [Music]
[9.04 - 15.72] find out what's making you sick and how
[10.92 - 19.04] to heal Anthony William is the medical
[15.72 - 21.04] medium hello I'm Anthony William and
[19.04 - 23.68] you're listening to the medical medium
[21.04 - 27.28] radio show where each week I talk about
[23.68 - 29.64] the most advanced healing information
[27.28 - 32.24] and secrets about health much of which
[29.64 - 34.96] is not found anywhere else and is
[32.24 - 36.76] decades ahead of what's out there now as
[34.96 - 38.32] I've always said who has 10 or 20 30
[36.76 - 41.88] years to wait for
[38.32 - 43.48] answers and answers for pots you know we
[41.88 - 46.56] need answers for
[43.48 - 48.84] pots um so many people suffer for with
[46.56 - 51.68] with it it's it's unbelievable what what
[48.84 - 54.16] they go through you may be one of them
[51.68 - 57.20] and you may have a mild rendition of it
[54.16 - 59.92] you may have a serious rendition of it
[57.20 - 62.32] either way this is the only Health show
[59.92 - 63.88] so here where the information doesn't
[62.32 - 65.68] come from medical interest groups
[63.88 - 67.80] medical funding with strings attached
[65.68 - 71.48] botched up research with the thumb on
[67.80 - 74.16] the scale medical lobbyists internal
[71.48 - 77.00] Kickbacks persuaded belief systems which
[74.16 - 79.72] is sucked into every part of alternative
[77.00 - 82.76] and conventional medicine private panels
[79.72 - 85.76] of influencers health field payoffs or
[82.76 - 89.48] trendy traps the information here is
[85.76 - 92.56] pure it comes untampered with from a
[89.48 - 93.88] clean source to me higher source I call
[92.56 - 96.24] Spirit of
[93.88 - 99.12] compassion and that's very important to
[96.24 - 101.96] know about and you're going to know that
[99.12 - 106.00] when we talk about pots why this has to
[101.96 - 108.96] be pure information and why it can't be
[106.00 - 111.12] agenda driven information that's
[108.96 - 113.12] contaminated both conventionally and
[111.12 - 115.08] alternatively in the world that there
[113.12 - 116.72] I'm talking about doctors doctors are
[115.08 - 118.92] the greatest thing in the world and
[116.72 - 122.72] surgeons sure doctors you know the best
[118.92 - 124.56] thing ever you can do is you know you go
[122.72 - 126.00] to your doctor when you see your doctor
[124.56 - 128.92] whether it's a naturopath functional
[126.00 - 131.28] medicine doctor regular MD specialist
[128.92 - 133.12] immunologist hematologist oncologist
[131.28 - 134.52] whoever it is and now you stick your
[133.12 - 136.16] hand out and you just say listen thank
[134.52 - 139.08] you I appreciate the fact that you
[136.16 - 140.80] dedicated your life to helping so many
[139.08 - 142.80] and being there for so many and day in
[140.80 - 145.12] and day out and I really I just really
[142.80 - 146.16] appreciate it just thank you thank you
[145.12 - 147.56] whether you're healing whether you're
[146.16 - 149.08] working on healing whether you're just
[147.56 - 150.76] went to your first doctor whether
[149.08 - 153.64] whatever it is
[150.76 - 156.68] because um and same to the nurses and
[153.64 - 159.08] same to the nurses actually nurses are
[156.68 - 161.44] critically important for sure I've known
[159.08 - 165.12] uh hundreds and hundreds of them over
[161.44 - 167.68] the years and it's and you you know and
[165.12 - 169.24] and listen it's about the information we
[167.68 - 171.24] talk about on the show medical medium if
[169.24 - 173.96] this is the first time that you've come
[171.24 - 175.72] to the medical Medium show um what I
[173.96 - 179.16] mean by pure information I mean this
[175.72 - 181.20] information hasn't been misguided by
[179.16 - 183.20] funding or something you know that's
[181.20 - 186.48] Twisted it or something like that for
[183.20 - 189.52] example autoimmune autoimmune we're
[186.48 - 191.84] talking about pots right and pots is
[189.52 - 195.12] considered an autoimmune syndrome
[191.84 - 197.28] autoimmune disease autoimmune condition
[195.12 - 198.92] right that's what is considered well
[197.28 - 202.04] first of all
[198.92 - 204.60] autoimmune isn't even right the body
[202.04 - 207.28] attacking self isn't even right and that
[204.60 - 208.40] contamination from that misguided theory
[207.28 - 212.92] that became
[208.40 - 214.84] law that has poisoned poisoned literally
[212.92 - 217.56] the medical systems both alternative and
[214.84 - 219.76] conventional and I I had to write a
[217.56 - 222.52] chapter about it in the thyroid healing
[219.76 - 224.88] book I just couldn't help myself I had
[222.52 - 227.60] to I had to because it's still that
[224.88 - 230.24] poisonous toxic and still it's ruining
[227.60 - 232.64] people's lives in many ways you don't
[230.24 - 235.92] think it is oh it is if you're new to
[232.64 - 237.76] the show and don't realize this no it is
[235.92 - 239.80] cuz if you think your body is destroying
[237.76 - 241.28] itself creating your illness causing
[239.80 - 242.56] your illness attacking yourself
[241.28 - 244.52] attacking your nervous system whatever
[242.56 - 245.36] it's attacking if you think that's what
[244.52 - 248.04] it's
[245.36 - 250.76] doing that's not going to help you
[248.04 - 253.16] heal it's going to kick you down a
[250.76 - 254.92] notch because it's wrong to begin with
[253.16 - 257.64] it's not even
[254.92 - 259.20] correct and and if it was correct it
[257.64 - 261.00] still would it still would kick you down
[259.20 - 263.32] a notch of course it would but it's not
[261.00 - 265.04] correct it's not even real we're going
[263.32 - 266.44] to talk about why and how it's not real
[265.04 - 268.60] and everything else it's important to
[266.44 - 271.84] know the autoimmune great mistake I call
[268.60 - 275.52] it the first great
[271.84 - 277.48] mistake of all time the first great
[275.52 - 280.36] mistake and you'll see in the thyroid
[277.48 - 282.84] healing Book You'll see there's a whole
[280.36 - 285.08] bunch of great mistakes that I that I
[282.84 - 287.36] write about that I clarify that I
[285.08 - 289.92] Rectify that I clarify very important to
[287.36 - 291.52] know that very important to know because
[289.92 - 293.36] when you read them you'll see oh my God
[291.52 - 294.92] this is a great mistake oh my God I
[293.36 - 298.48] understand now it's important to not for
[294.92 - 301.48] your healing because great mistakes that
[298.48 - 305.20] are corrupted that Ru the gamma in the
[301.48 - 307.64] health field these great mistakes they
[305.20 - 311.68] stop people from healing they stop
[307.64 - 314.32] people from healing darn right that's
[311.68 - 315.96] what they do and if you don't know that
[314.32 - 318.48] that's not good you got to know that
[315.96 - 320.16] it's important to know that it's really
[318.48 - 323.60] important to know that an autoimmune the
[320.16 - 326.48] autoimmune Theory the great mistake of
[323.60 - 328.00] autoimmune because it was created
[326.48 - 330.20] because the medical industry doesn't
[328.00 - 332.16] know what causes pots
[330.20 - 334.60] it doesn't know what causes lupus it
[332.16 - 337.52] doesn't know what causes Ms it doesn't
[334.60 - 339.76] know what causes Hashimoto we know what
[337.52 - 342.52] causes those but the thyroid healing
[339.76 - 344.44] book I I put it right out there so the
[342.52 - 346.84] world will change so that you take the
[344.44 - 348.72] book and you tell somebody about it so
[346.84 - 350.20] that you bump into somebody like look
[348.72 - 352.88] you got to get this book because you
[350.20 - 356.20] need to know what's going on or here
[352.88 - 359.84] borrow my book so somebody else
[356.20 - 364.48] learns and because because the the body
[359.84 - 367.00] attacking itself isn't it isn't a a
[364.48 - 369.04] fact what's fact about it it's it's a
[367.00 - 372.20] misguided theory that became law that
[369.04 - 375.60] part is fact but it attacking the body
[372.20 - 377.24] isn't fact and it messes people up
[375.60 - 379.68] especially with pots that's why I have
[377.24 - 380.92] to talk about it a little bit the
[379.68 - 384.00] autoimmune
[380.92 - 387.88] theory was being funded in the 1950s
[384.00 - 391.48] this is when women were filing in like
[387.88 - 394.52] an army like like file filing in like
[391.48 - 399.56] soldiers that just came out of a war
[394.52 - 403.16] zone a war zone they were just fatigued
[399.56 - 405.08] sick couldn't function
[403.16 - 409.00] migraines central nervous system
[405.08 - 411.16] disorders brain fog confusion filing in
[409.00 - 414.56] left and right into doctor's offices out
[411.16 - 416.80] of nowhere out of nowhere ever before
[414.56 - 421.20] like never before in history in fact
[416.80 - 422.32] never before in history filing in
[421.20 - 424.64] filing
[422.32 - 426.84] in and they were filing into the
[424.64 - 429.08] doctor's offices with complaints that
[426.84 - 430.80] were all mystery and because these women
[429.08 - 432.68] were mostly in their 40s and their 50s
[430.80 - 434.32] and they were all on that edge of the
[432.68 - 437.44] hormone change and everything doctors
[434.32 - 440.32] said well Dr said first of all there was
[437.44 - 444.04] never ever changes in people before this
[440.32 - 446.20] in 1945 1950 before this women who went
[444.04 - 448.72] through the change felt better they felt
[446.20 - 450.04] better they had more libido they had
[448.72 - 451.56] less headaches
[450.04 - 453.36] they had less problems they had more
[451.56 - 455.80] energy they could exercise more they
[453.36 - 457.36] felt better they lost weight all these
[455.80 - 460.44] different things happened like that were
[457.36 - 462.84] all good then by 1945 it
[460.44 - 464.64] changed because there was a something
[462.84 - 466.44] was simultaneously happening during the
[464.64 - 469.12] change it had nothing to do with the
[466.44 - 471.24] change there was a virus that incubated
[469.12 - 473.12] and had a shelf life of 40 years before
[471.24 - 478.76] it came out and it was a virus the early
[473.12 - 482.88] epan bars of 1900 1890 1892 1889 1901
[478.76 - 486.44] 1905 five that virus that exploded got
[482.88 - 490.44] into people got into women very early
[486.44 - 491.84] on and men but it got into women caused
[490.44 - 495.48] the first
[491.84 - 498.04] eruption of sickness that's never before
[495.48 - 499.40] been seen first eruption of chronic
[498.04 - 501.68] illness symptoms what did the medical
[499.40 - 503.80] industry do they they try to sell it as
[501.68 - 505.16] a hormone thing of course they did
[503.80 - 507.36] because they were already developing
[505.16 - 511.64] hormones perfect
[507.36 - 514.56] timing sinister Sinister timing that's
[511.64 - 518.80] right but you know what else developed
[514.56 - 521.32] what else developed was yeah was a study
[518.80 - 522.72] you know looking for things so there
[521.32 - 524.96] were some good-hearted doctors and they
[522.72 - 527.36] were looking for things they're looking
[524.96 - 530.24] well they didn't think it was hormonal
[527.36 - 532.60] so there was some good doctors that said
[530.24 - 535.36] well you know we don't think this is
[532.60 - 537.20] hormone related they couldn't find
[535.36 - 538.24] anything they couldn't find a pathogen
[537.20 - 539.20] cuz they didn't know where to look and
[538.24 - 540.56] they didn't know how to look because
[539.20 - 542.08] because they couldn't find a pathogen
[540.56 - 544.56] they didn't understand pathogens they
[542.08 - 546.48] still don't to this day why am I talking
[544.56 - 549.92] about this because I'm talking about
[546.48 - 553.28] pots pathogens pathogens yes we're going
[549.92 - 555.80] to talk about pathogens related to
[553.28 - 558.04] pots so these doctors were looking for
[555.80 - 560.16] pathogens couldn't find any but what
[558.04 - 563.60] they found was an
[560.16 - 566.56] antibody which they claimed as an auto
[563.60 - 569.44] antibod the body creating an auto
[566.56 - 571.20] antibody to attack itself causing
[569.44 - 574.56] symptoms in the
[571.20 - 577.08] 1950s it got funded and became law it
[574.56 - 580.04] was a theory there was no evidence
[577.08 - 582.20] whatsoever that an antibody or a auto
[580.04 - 584.04] antibody attacks anything in fact they
[582.20 - 586.88] couldn't even see that it wasn't even
[584.04 - 590.56] humanly possible or
[586.88 - 592.88] visible what a screw up of all time it
[590.56 - 594.56] became law it was funded just like that
[592.88 - 596.16] so back to the beginning of the show
[594.56 - 598.00] it's like that thing I say at the very
[596.16 - 600.08] beginning the information here is pure
[598.00 - 602.16] it wasn't backed by trusted old
[600.08 - 604.56] grandfathered medical funding laws with
[602.16 - 607.44] strings attached in panels of
[604.56 - 609.68] influencers and thing tanks it wasn't
[607.44 - 611.04] it's not that information it's pure and
[609.68 - 612.36] it's clean and that's why you're here
[611.04 - 614.88] because you're going to learn about pots
[612.36 - 616.44] today so what happened was the theory of
[614.88 - 619.76] autoimmune was
[616.44 - 622.88] birthed and it became law and no one
[619.76 - 625.80] ever went against it no one ever went
[622.88 - 627.24] against it that just assumed it was it
[625.80 - 628.64] and then people who go to medical school
[627.24 - 630.80] they just get taught whatever and they
[628.64 - 633.88] out they go they just process them and
[630.80 - 635.76] stamp them out out you go out you go
[633.88 - 638.04] okay you just graduated okay you're good
[635.76 - 639.64] do your internship okay out you go yep
[638.04 - 642.08] that's the theories okay here's all the
[639.64 - 642.92] bum theories here you go that's how it
[642.08 - 646.00] was
[642.92 - 649.48] done still
[646.00 - 651.24] is right when it comes down to these but
[649.48 - 652.92] there's good stuff they learn in medical
[651.24 - 654.44] school but they you know where they
[652.92 - 657.24] learn most of their stuff they learn it
[654.44 - 658.56] in practice when they wake up and they
[657.24 - 660.48] go to their first practice day and
[658.56 - 662.32] they're like who why is it so different
[660.48 - 663.72] what are all these problems people have
[662.32 - 665.88] they didn't even talk about this in
[663.72 - 667.68] medical school wait a minute what what's
[665.88 - 670.80] going on and they got to learn you got
[667.68 - 673.08] to go in the trenches and you got to
[670.80 - 675.36] learn and the best medical doctors in
[673.08 - 676.92] the world do that and then they and then
[675.36 - 678.44] decide they want to get interested in
[676.92 - 680.20] something and they go into a specialized
[678.44 - 682.16] field and they dive in and they can't
[680.20 - 684.08] get funding because the funding is
[682.16 - 686.64] corrupted because no one wants to know
[684.08 - 689.24] about what's really causing pots no one
[686.64 - 690.68] wants to know what's really causing pot
[689.24 - 693.52] so these doctors can't get these
[690.68 - 695.00] immunologists can't get funding but if
[693.52 - 696.48] they want to play around with genes and
[695.00 - 698.16] autoimmune theories they could get all
[696.48 - 700.76] the funding they want because that's the
[698.16 - 702.28] belief in the law if they want to play
[700.76 - 703.84] around with jeans you know why doctors
[702.28 - 705.92] are going into jeans so much it's the
[703.84 - 708.40] only thing they can get funded for how
[705.92 - 709.80] about that how about them apples how
[708.40 - 712.96] about them
[709.80 - 715.08] apples yeah it's important to
[712.96 - 716.32] know someone said to me the other day
[715.08 - 717.80] you've been doing a lot of ranting and
[716.32 - 719.44] raving about stuff I said yeah it's
[717.80 - 720.76] critical for people to know because
[719.44 - 721.72] you're going to blame theirselves they
[720.76 - 723.00] going to blame their health they're
[721.72 - 724.68] going to blame their bodies breaking
[723.00 - 727.36] down they're going to blame it on Old
[724.68 - 728.56] theories and they're going to get hurt
[727.36 - 730.04] and this person said you know what I
[728.56 - 731.20] didn't think about it that way I go
[730.04 - 734.00] that's because you're not suffering with
[731.20 - 735.92] pots you're not suffering with something
[734.00 - 737.80] that's why you're feeling fine you go to
[735.92 - 739.32] the golf course you play golf you feel
[737.80 - 740.32] fine okay you got a little high blood
[739.32 - 742.32] pressure you got a little bit of
[740.32 - 743.52] cholesterol doctors don't know why I
[742.32 - 745.04] know why it's because your a liver
[743.52 - 747.44] problem that they can't
[745.04 - 749.12] find but you got nothing going on so you
[747.44 - 750.48] just go play golf and you're okay but so
[749.12 - 751.72] you don't you don't really like my
[750.48 - 754.76] ranting and
[751.72 - 756.00] raving cuz you know you're not in a bed

[801.44 - 805.88] is what it is it's things that you have
[804.44 - 807.72] to understand you need to know a little
[805.88 - 810.36] history so you don't just you don't
[807.72 - 812.76] destroy yourself with the bad Theory and
[810.36 - 815.12] not heal one of the ways you heal from
[812.76 - 817.76] pots just like you heal from other
[815.12 - 820.84] misguided labeled
[817.76 - 822.68] illnesses one of the ways you heal is
[820.84 - 825.04] knowing what's wrong obviously and
[822.68 - 826.28] what's causing it the other thing is
[825.04 - 830.16] what to do for
[826.28 - 833.44] it but also shed away and dispel the
[830.16 - 836.76] bull the lies the theories that were
[833.44 - 839.20] grandfathered in that get in your way
[836.76 - 840.80] and that's the other piece of it darn
[839.20 - 843.52] right that's the other piece of it I'm
[840.80 - 845.16] talking about you better believe
[843.52 - 848.60] it
[845.16 - 850.48] and and this is critical to know so here
[848.60 - 852.52] we are we're going to get down to the
[850.48 - 855.20] bottom what causes dis
[852.52 - 857.32] atomia disauto atomia
[855.20 - 860.84] sorry we're going to get down to the
[857.32 - 863.24] bottom of a postural orthostatic tacac
[860.84 - 865.96] cardia syndrome we going to get to the
[863.24 - 868.84] bottom of that dis autonomia comes in
[865.96 - 872.00] different shapes and sizes it comes in
[868.84 - 874.24] different shapes and sizes different
[872.00 - 878.04] different levels of disautonomia
[874.24 - 880.76] different L levels of it different um
[878.04 - 882.16] different you extreme to mild the whole
[880.76 - 883.52] B you might be suffering with it and
[882.16 - 886.44] you're listening to the
[883.52 - 888.92] show you might be
[886.44 - 890.64] suffering and and and struggling with it
[888.92 - 892.96] it's a struggle for a lot of people it's
[890.64 - 894.36] really difficult I mean you know you
[892.96 - 896.28] know and if you you might have a loved
[894.36 - 897.68] one with it you got to take care of your
[896.28 - 902.04] daughter with
[897.68 - 903.68] it and it hits a lot of young women why
[902.04 - 908.84] why does it hit a lot of young
[903.68 - 911.72] women why it does hits men too but hits
[908.84 - 914.04] a lot of young women there's a reason
[911.72 - 916.96] for that there's a reason for that there
[914.04 - 919.64] a lot of Epstein bars I said it Epstein
[916.96 - 921.88] bars that get into women really young
[919.64 - 923.36] when they're young causing early monos
[921.88 - 925.52] that sometimes aren't even detected
[923.36 - 927.56] mostly aren't even detected they go to
[925.52 - 929.20] another phase in another stage and they
[927.56 - 932.68] end up getting the nervous
[929.20 - 934.80] system inflamed and it gets diagnosed as
[932.68 - 937.60] pots they get all the symptoms
[934.80 - 941.00] pots except Steen bar the one thing I
[937.60 - 943.44] have to Grant the one thing I have to
[941.00 - 946.76] Grant the medical
[943.44 - 949.00] industry with is they actually think
[946.76 - 950.92] there's a correlation with a viral issue
[949.00 - 952.92] they don't know what kind of virus they
[950.92 - 954.40] don't have a clue they don't know what
[952.92 - 955.84] they're talking about as far as what
[954.40 - 958.28] looking for a virus they don't know any
[955.84 - 961.72] of that but I have to give them credit
[958.28 - 964.60] we're credit is due they affiliated
[961.72 - 967.56] gilon Beret sometimes
[964.60 - 971.20] lupus and a viral
[967.56 - 974.68] condition into it a little bit the big
[971.20 - 978.76] mistake is it's not the viral
[974.68 - 981.04] issue they hang their hat on they hang
[978.76 - 984.48] their hat on the body attacking itself
[981.04 - 987.00] they're big nasty mistake negligent
[984.48 - 991.28] Mistake by accident through default of
[987.00 - 993.88] being taught this by the system by the
[991.28 - 995.60] industry their their mistake is the
[993.88 - 998.00] great mistake of autoimmune in the body
[995.60 - 1000.72] attacking itself pots is not the body
[998.00 - 1002.92] attacking itself but they do have one
[1000.72 - 1006.00] thing they caught on to is
[1002.92 - 1008.40] viral there is a viral correlation they
[1006.00 - 1012.12] don't know how what why and I got to
[1008.40 - 1016.32] give them respect and I got to give
[1012.12 - 1020.28] them thankfulness and honor and and and
[1016.32 - 1022.80] glory to that glory be because they
[1020.28 - 1025.36] they're figuring that
[1022.80 - 1028.00] out but here's what's happening you got
[1025.36 - 1031.44] a virus that's causing the problem
[1028.00 - 1033.24] that's attacking the body can I tell you
[1031.44 - 1035.00] the difference between knowing your
[1033.24 - 1036.68] body's not attacking itself versus a
[1035.00 - 1040.60] virus is let me tell you the
[1036.68 - 1043.96] difference you got control back because
[1040.60 - 1047.84] we can stomp on a virus we can kick the
[1043.96 - 1053.44] crap out of a virus over time we can
[1047.84 - 1057.76] beat a virus down over time we can beat
[1053.44 - 1060.80] it we can beat it we can do things like
[1057.76 - 1063.88] take lemon bomb which is
[1060.80 - 1065.44] Melissa and Melissa doesn't take any
[1063.88 - 1071.72] crap at
[1065.44 - 1074.36] all Melissa can kick the life out of a
[1071.72 - 1077.16] virus because she doesn't take it she
[1074.36 - 1079.40] does take any crap doesn't take any heat
[1077.16 - 1082.36] from anybody you can't mess with her
[1079.40 - 1085.16] that's one powerful herb one powerful
[1082.36 - 1088.04] herb right there you take lemon bomb
[1085.16 - 1090.64] long enough and you just slowly squash
[1088.04 - 1093.44] and beat down that bully and beat down
[1090.64 - 1095.56] that bully and beat it down until it's
[1093.44 - 1097.20] down to the ground because when you know
[1095.56 - 1099.36] you got a bug causing the problem and
[1097.20 - 1101.76] you know your body is protecting you and
[1099.36 - 1105.20] not hurting you you start turning around
[1101.76 - 1107.28] your pots over time darn right that's
[1105.20 - 1109.96] the power of it I had somebody say to me
[1107.28 - 1111.60] I had a practitioner say
[1109.96 - 1112.84] practitioners said to me a while back I
[1111.60 - 1116.80] remember it I'll never forget it they
[1112.84 - 1119.24] said okay so you're saying you're saying
[1116.80 - 1121.36] Anthony that it's not the body attacking
[1119.24 - 1123.28] itself you're saying it's a virus
[1121.36 - 1124.24] attacking the body wasn't that going to
[1123.28 - 1125.63] scare the
[1124.24 - 1128.20] person I
[1125.63 - 1131.00] [Laughter]
[1128.20 - 1135.00] said I said I'm going to tell you right
[1131.00 - 1136.48] now let's pretend you're the patient and
[1135.00 - 1138.00] and this practitioner doctor said okay
[1136.48 - 1140.16] I'll pretend I'm the patient I said come
[1138.00 - 1143.24] on serious seriously put your hat on put
[1140.16 - 1146.12] your thinking cap on become that patient
[1143.24 - 1147.48] become that patient that you see and he
[1146.12 - 1150.28] said all right all right I'm doing it
[1147.48 - 1154.00] I'm doing it I'm the patient I got these
[1150.28 - 1156.56] symptoms I said let's do more than that
[1154.00 - 1158.20] you got these symptoms which you can't
[1156.56 - 1160.12] feel because you don't really have them
[1158.20 - 1161.80] I said to the doctor I said but you got
[1160.12 - 1163.36] these symptoms but you got other things
[1161.80 - 1165.72] going on you can't work anymore so you
[1163.36 - 1167.88] got to give up your practice he goes oh
[1165.72 - 1170.68] that's that that sucks that's what he
[1167.88 - 1172.68] said to me he said that word so I'm not
[1170.68 - 1176.76] trying to say nasty words he just said
[1172.68 - 1178.80] that word and I said yeah you lost your
[1176.76 - 1182.64] practice cuz you can't work anymore and
[1178.80 - 1185.36] he said all right okay okay that that
[1182.64 - 1187.76] that hurts I go that hurts huh you don't
[1185.36 - 1190.96] have any you don't have any symptoms I
[1187.76 - 1193.24] said but that hurts doesn't it and it
[1190.96 - 1195.16] goes yeah yeah that hurts I gu okay and
[1193.24 - 1197.76] then then people they kind of think
[1195.16 - 1199.28] you're a hypercondriac too so you got to
[1197.76 - 1200.12] you got to f file for disability and you
[1199.28 - 1202.28] got people that think you're
[1200.12 - 1203.96] hypercondriac you got to lean on other
[1202.28 - 1205.52] family members for help and financial
[1203.96 - 1207.68] help and everything else and to get food
[1205.52 - 1208.72] and all kinds of other stuff and he's
[1207.68 - 1211.60] thinking about all these things and he
[1208.72 - 1214.44] goes oh my God I go yeah this stuff
[1211.60 - 1216.48] hurts doesn't it goes yeah it hurts I'm
[1214.44 - 1218.68] really feeling it I'm just I feel for
[1216.48 - 1222.28] the people that go through serious pots
[1218.68 - 1225.52] and other the other illnesses and that
[1222.28 - 1228.24] have labels just like that lupus and so
[1225.52 - 1230.00] forth and everything and he goes he goes
[1228.24 - 1231.68] all right I said no I I want you to take
[1230.00 - 1234.24] this seriously cuz I am and I'm not
[1231.68 - 1236.04] liking this I go yeah I know I go and
[1234.24 - 1238.80] then you have a relationship the

[1250.36 - 1254.88] this is real and he goes okay okay okay
[1253.44 - 1257.92] let's get to the point I said okay well
[1254.88 - 1259.36] here's the point okay just say I'm the
[1257.92 - 1260.80] doctor doctor of course I'm not a doctor

[1303.28 - 1307.60] symptoms you got pots you got all these
[1305.08 - 1311.72] problems and your body's attacking
[1307.60 - 1313.16] itself and he goes all right yeah okay
[1311.72 - 1314.96] yeah okay I got you and that's what I
[1313.16 - 1318.04] tell people because that's autoimmune
[1314.96 - 1319.16] it's autoimmune I go yeah I go it's a
[1318.04 - 1322.08] attacking
[1319.16 - 1323.96] itself I go how does that feel he goes
[1322.08 - 1325.64] you know what he said it it doesn't feel
[1323.96 - 1328.32] good I get it I know what you're trying
[1325.64 - 1331.32] to do I said all right Jack Jack Jack
[1328.32 - 1333.44] Jack listen your body's not attacking
[1331.32 - 1336.24] itself I need to tell you the truth he
[1333.44 - 1338.28] goes all right what's the truth I go you
[1336.24 - 1341.12] have a virus that's been in your system
[1338.28 - 1343.32] a long time and that's what's causing
[1341.12 - 1346.36] problems and inflaming and attacking the
[1343.32 - 1348.92] body he goes all right he goes is there
[1346.36 - 1350.24] anything we can do go of course there is
[1348.92 - 1351.72] why don't we go after the virus he goes
[1350.24 - 1354.60] you know I got some good ideas to go
[1351.72 - 1356.48] after a virus too I am a doctor I'm not
[1354.60 - 1358.32] 100% alternative but I'm partly
[1356.48 - 1360.56] alternative and I'm mostly you know an
[1358.32 - 1363.28] MD regular conventional because but I
[1360.56 - 1364.80] got some ideas I go yeah we're going to
[1363.28 - 1367.00] go after the virus he goes that sounds
[1364.80 - 1370.56] amazing he goes his life changed his
[1367.00 - 1372.64] life changed he wasn't sick we were just
[1370.56 - 1376.64] we were playing the
[1372.64 - 1378.40] roles he his life changed from that then
[1376.64 - 1380.28] he went back and he started looking up
[1378.40 - 1383.16] the law of the autoimmune law and then
[1380.28 - 1385.20] he was on the computer and then he was
[1383.16 - 1387.56] sending me all this stuff and all these
[1385.20 - 1389.20] old documents of how it was just a
[1387.56 - 1390.88] theory and how they don't even know what
[1389.20 - 1392.80] that auto antibod is doing and
[1390.88 - 1395.92] antibodies doing they have no clue and
[1392.80 - 1399.52] he's sending me all this data on how it
[1395.92 - 1401.52] falls through your hands like
[1399.52 - 1405.16] sand excuse
[1401.52 - 1409.48] me I just drank a whole thing of celery
[1405.16 - 1412.76] juice and you know he was liter Al like
[1409.48 - 1415.72] it fell through his fingers like
[1412.76 - 1418.36] sand and he couldn't believe
[1415.72 - 1421.08] it he couldn't believe it it was just an
[1418.36 - 1424.40] old grandfathered funded idea that was a
[1421.08 - 1426.00] concept that's poisonous and from there
[1424.40 - 1428.28] on out
[1426.00 - 1430.20] everybody he doesn't say the body's
[1428.28 - 1434.44] attacking
[1430.20 - 1436.84] itself never he never ever tells his
[1434.44 - 1438.60] patients they file in he never tells
[1436.84 - 1442.04] them their body's attacked backing
[1438.60 - 1445.20] itself ever
[1442.04 - 1448.24] again that's right that's
[1445.20 - 1451.24] right instead he goes after
[1448.24 - 1453.32] pathogens he goes after pathogens and he
[1451.24 - 1456.12] doesn't mess around and one of his best
[1453.32 - 1458.72] friends now is Melissa the girl that
[1456.12 - 1462.08] really doesn't take any crap and she
[1458.72 - 1463.76] knows how to kickbox big time and she
[1462.08 - 1468.16] kicks kickbox
[1463.76 - 1470.04] is Epstein bar right down to the ground
[1468.16 - 1471.76] and that's what lemon balm does that's
[1470.04 - 1473.92] what Melissa does and you
[1471.76 - 1476.96] know and that's just one thing that's
[1473.92 - 1479.76] just one thing we can do the point is is
[1476.96 - 1482.12] it matters so let's talk about pots
[1479.76 - 1486.56] let's talk about the whole thing this
[1482.12 - 1488.56] autot Tomia is um is is another theory
[1486.56 - 1492.48] circulation to the nerve
[1488.56 - 1495.72] circulation um slow vein draw going up
[1492.48 - 1496.76] the body um you get up too fast your
[1495.72 - 1499.88] heart
[1496.76 - 1502.00] races but what's really happening what's
[1499.88 - 1504.60] really happening it's a viral condition
[1502.00 - 1506.84] 100% it's a viral condition that sits
[1504.60 - 1508.16] inside the liver it's a viral condition
[1506.84 - 1509.84] that's been sitting in the liver for a
[1508.16 - 1511.28] long time producing producing a
[1509.84 - 1513.20] tremendous amount of
[1511.28 - 1517.68] neurotoxins
[1513.20 - 1519.68] neurotoxins pots is a neurot sorry is a
[1517.68 - 1522.68] neurotoxin
[1519.68 - 1525.56] disorder chronic research with chronic
[1522.68 - 1527.76] illness chronic illness in science
[1525.56 - 1530.28] research medical research and science
[1527.76 - 1533.32] research with chronic illness is so far
[1530.28 - 1535.48] behind it's it's it can make someone
[1533.32 - 1538.44] depressed you know someone said to me do
[1535.48 - 1540.84] you ever get depressed I said yeah I do
[1538.44 - 1542.40] I do get depressed they're like what the
[1540.84 - 1543.56] Anthony William gets depressed what are
[1542.40 - 1545.00] you talking about yeah I get depressed
[1543.56 - 1547.36] all the time they're like you need to do
[1545.00 - 1550.48] something for that I go yeah I do and
[1547.36 - 1551.72] they go what I go I talk about what gets
[1550.48 - 1554.72] me
[1551.72 - 1556.72] depressed in my books and in in in the
[1554.72 - 1559.08] radio shows I said what are you talking
[1556.72 - 1560.68] about I said yeah it's a fact that
[1559.08 - 1562.20] medical science medical research is so
[1560.68 - 1564.16] far behind on chronic illness it's the
[1562.20 - 1567.16] most depressing thing I've ever
[1564.16 - 1569.52] seen it's set it saddens me deep in the
[1567.16 - 1573.80] heart deep in the soul every single
[1569.52 - 1575.60] day and it's it's it's it's a it's it's
[1573.80 - 1577.72] that part I have to bear of it of
[1575.60 - 1580.36] knowing how behind it is it's so behind
[1577.72 - 1583.76] it's maddening it's so Antiquity it's
[1580.36 - 1586.36] maddening it's so Antiquity it's so
[1583.76 - 1588.20] antique that just the newest experts
[1586.36 - 1589.84] today putting out books meaning whether
[1588.20 - 1592.32] it's on thyroid or anything else it's
[1589.84 - 1594.56] it's it's so sad to even see it and
[1592.32 - 1596.12] that's the newest in what year are we in
[1594.56 - 1597.68] where still the body attacking itself
[1596.12 - 1600.16] stuff it's still misinformation it's
[1597.68 - 1602.68] still theories it's still it's
[1600.16 - 1605.72] unbelievable everything and that that I
[1602.68 - 1608.16] mean and anything in any Arena and you
[1605.72 - 1610.88] know natural medicine is great it's just
[1608.16 - 1612.60] chronic illness it's still behind it's
[1610.88 - 1614.32] depressing
[1612.60 - 1618.88] suppressing
[1614.32 - 1621.84] so with when it comes down to pots what
[1618.88 - 1625.32] it is it's a neurotoxic disorder it's
[1621.84 - 1628.00] 100% neurotoxic related neurotoxins
[1625.32 - 1629.84] caused by the Epstein bar the Epstein
[1628.00 - 1632.48] bar one of the varieties that causes
[1629.84 - 1636.04] pots one of the varieties out of the 60
[1632.48 - 1639.12] plus v varieties that causes pots that
[1636.04 - 1641.36] is the cause it's Epstein bar and
[1639.12 - 1644.40] Epstein bar sits in the liver produces a
[1641.36 - 1647.64] tremendous amount of neurotoxin that
[1644.40 - 1649.96] neurotoxin floats around it swells up
[1647.64 - 1651.72] the nerves so you can't exercise it
[1649.96 - 1654.28] swells up the nerves so you get the
[1651.72 - 1657.24] brain fog it swells up the nerves so you
[1654.28 - 1660.24] can't focus it swells up the nerves so
[1657.24 - 1662.80] the heart Works harder the liver pushes
[1660.24 - 1665.52] the blood out of the out through the
[1662.80 - 1667.04] liver up to the heart making it as clean
[1665.52 - 1669.24] as it can but when there's too many
[1667.04 - 1671.56] neurotoxins flooding the flooding the
[1669.24 - 1674.52] bloodstream the neurotoxins go into the
[1671.56 - 1678.32] heart and they Tire the
[1674.52 - 1682.60] heart they Tire the heart heart
[1678.32 - 1685.68] palpitations are part of this a Gunk
[1682.60 - 1687.44] collects a debris collects in the mitro
[1685.68 - 1689.68] valve and other valves creating
[1687.44 - 1694.32] different varieties of eutopic heartbeat
[1689.68 - 1696.72] ectopic heartbeat and Pals heart palps
[1694.32 - 1699.08] it's an Epstein bar related
[1696.72 - 1700.72] symptom the one thing I love though one
[1699.08 - 1703.04] thing that gives me hope is they at
[1700.72 - 1705.08] least realize that gilon Beret could
[1703.04 - 1708.36] have something even to do with pots
[1705.08 - 1712.48] thank the Lord because
[1708.36 - 1715.32] and uh I say that because gilon ber is
[1712.48 - 1718.40] an Epstein bar illness gilon Bret is
[1715.32 - 1721.24] Epstein bar it's an Epstein bar illness
[1718.40 - 1723.24] so someday and my hopes and dreams and
[1721.24 - 1724.84] in my heart they're just going to
[1723.24 - 1727.28] override the
[1724.84 - 1729.44] stupidity and it's going to come
[1727.28 - 1731.44] together and we're going to know finally
[1729.44 - 1733.64] what's wrong with people so we can help
[1731.44 - 1736.84] more people than I can help every day
[1733.64 - 1738.56] I'm just one guy what if everybody knew
[1736.84 - 1740.20] the truth
[1738.56 - 1742.96] things that change and maybe we could
[1740.20 - 1745.36] beat out the funding machine and all the
[1742.96 - 1747.12] nasty stuff behind it all we can beat
[1745.36 - 1749.84] out that bureaucracy that's involved in
[1747.12 - 1751.76] the medical worlds both alternative and
[1749.84 - 1753.28] conventional that just you know and the
[1751.76 - 1754.96] reason why they want us and you know
[1753.28 - 1758.76] what they'll just throw pots right into
[1754.96 - 1760.96] genetics big time if your Epstein bar
[1758.76 - 1763.20] came from your parents or if you're
[1760.96 - 1764.80] sensitive to Epstein bars because you
[1763.20 - 1767.12] happen to have a lot of mercury in your
[1764.80 - 1769.80] system and then your daughter you know
[1767.12 - 1771.60] has the Epstein bar and and she has the
[1769.80 - 1773.64] Mercury and she develops a symptom
[1771.60 - 1777.20] similar to poan St
[1773.64 - 1779.52] genetic that's an evil evil machine I
[1777.20 - 1782.36] talk about that more and more each day
[1779.52 - 1784.92] more and more each day the problem is
[1782.36 - 1787.48] here's what's hard when you put out the
[1784.92 - 1789.52] truth and people already invest their
[1787.48 - 1791.60] lives into the nontruth they're going to
[1789.52 - 1793.48] fight for it they're going to fight for
[1791.60 - 1795.36] it tooth and nail they're going to fight
[1793.48 - 1797.84] for it man because they just put their
[1795.36 - 1799.56] work into it so when this guy
[1797.84 - 1801.60] put his work in the funding and all the
[1799.56 - 1804.08] funding goes into some autoimmune theory
[1801.60 - 1806.04] that that like I said this Dr Guy know
[1804.08 - 1807.72] that Jack said that that's even a theory
[1806.04 - 1810.52] that they they never even proved the
[1807.72 - 1814.48] auto antibody the auto
[1810.52 - 1816.32] antibody is an antibod actually produced
[1814.48 - 1819.44] by the immune system to only go after
[1816.32 - 1822.00] one thing the virus never the body the
[1819.44 - 1824.80] virus so go it's geared only go after
[1822.00 - 1826.64] the Epstein bar and only the Epstein bar
[1824.80 - 1828.80] but it needs help it needs more than
[1826.64 - 1830.76] just that we we need the herbs we need
[1828.80 - 1832.44] the nutrients we need the foods to go
[1830.76 - 1834.32] after the Epstein bar to we need to do a
[1832.44 - 1836.84] whole campaign against it so back to
[1834.32 - 1840.12] what I was saying when you invest into a
[1836.84 - 1841.96] nontruth like autoimmune or you write
[1840.12 - 1844.08] books about genes because you're
[1841.96 - 1846.08] invested and you're you're interested in
[1844.08 - 1848.12] these these topics so you write a whole
[1846.08 - 1851.08] book on it and you invest your life into
[1848.12 - 1853.88] it it's you can't just turn that off and
[1851.08 - 1857.28] go with the truth you can't just say oh
[1853.88 - 1859.28] okay wait a minute all right all right
[1857.28 - 1861.44] you know I can't you can't put on the
[1859.28 - 1863.92] brakes that's one of the problems so
[1861.44 - 1866.12] when nontruth is out there to such a
[1863.92 - 1868.68] saturation and everybody's got all their
[1866.12 - 1870.68] money invested in their time their books
[1868.68 - 1872.60] you name it about autoimmune books left
[1870.68 - 1874.48] and right and it's all wrong information
[1872.60 - 1876.56] it's all autoimmune books by the piles
[1874.48 - 1877.84] out there just buy the truckloads and
[1876.56 - 1879.52] they invest in that you think they're
[1877.84 - 1882.44] going to just shut that
[1879.52 - 1884.12] down and and and and admit that they
[1882.44 - 1886.16] made a mistake even if they learn the
[1884.12 - 1887.88] truth no and this is why nothing gets
[1886.16 - 1889.08] done and we just can't get there but you
[1887.88 - 1892.28] know the truth and we're going to work
[1889.08 - 1893.40] on that we're going to work with that so
[1892.28 - 1895.84] here's the
[1893.40 - 1897.56] deal the deal is with pots it's about
[1895.84 - 1899.40] going after the Epstein bar virus you
[1897.56 - 1900.88] can recover I've recovered lots of
[1899.40 - 1903.04] people and what I mean lots of people
[1900.88 - 1905.16] over the decades hundreds of people with
[1903.04 - 1906.84] pots recovered them so they actually had
[1905.16 - 1908.44] their life back so they can get out of
[1906.84 - 1910.84] bed and say oh my God I'm actually going
[1908.44 - 1913.04] to walk five miles can you believe that
[1910.84 - 1915.04] I'm going to go walk 5 miles and I I'm
[1913.04 - 1916.44] going to feed myself in between it all
[1915.04 - 1917.96] and I'm going to be able to do what I
[1916.44 - 1920.84] need to do I'm going to go take a shower
[1917.96 - 1924.48] people with pots can't shower it means
[1920.84 - 1926.96] it's they just they they lost a day they
[1924.48 - 1930.28] lost a day in their life cuz they
[1926.96 - 1932.80] showered that means they're dizzy
[1930.28 - 1936.00] they're worn out that means they're back
[1932.80 - 1940.28] in bed because of a
[1936.00 - 1942.16] shower they lost a day can you imagine
[1940.28 - 1944.64] right I'm sure some some of you probably
[1942.16 - 1946.60] do imagine because you're going through
[1944.64 - 1948.60] it you lose a day and the reason why is
[1946.60 - 1950.88] cuz when that water hits your head and
[1948.60 - 1952.72] nobody knows this this is another this
[1950.88 - 1953.96] is another truth that just doesn't exist
[1952.72 - 1957.44] out there I mean nobody knows it
[1953.96 - 1958.76] nobody's nobody knows that Spirit knows
[1957.44 - 1960.64] and here's what happens when the water
[1958.76 - 1962.48] hits the head all the nerve endings all
[1960.64 - 1965.16] the nerves that go up around the skull
[1962.48 - 1966.80] on the outside of the brain they all hit
[1965.16 - 1969.00] the inside of the skull there all these
[1966.80 - 1971.32] different nerve endings those nerve
[1969.00 - 1973.48] endings are filled with neurotoxins from
[1971.32 - 1975.68] the have being so viral so long having
[1973.48 - 1978.56] the epine bar in your system so long and
[1975.68 - 1979.56] those neurotoxins
[1978.56 - 1982.12] those
[1979.56 - 1983.68] neurotoxins they inflame those nerves
[1982.12 - 1987.16] those nerves become inflamed from the
[1983.68 - 1988.84] virus from the viral nerv neurotoxins
[1987.16 - 1991.60] it's not the body attacking itself so
[1988.84 - 1994.64] when you have water hitting your head
[1991.60 - 1996.96] and it's hitting it's hitting those
[1994.64 - 1998.48] nerves and the vertigo could come the
[1996.96 - 2000.28] dizziness the imbalance you get out of
[1998.48 - 2002.56] the shower you're like oh my God let me
[2000.28 - 2004.64] just get to my my couch or my bed that
[2002.56 - 2006.56] was it for the day you're lucky two
[2004.64 - 2008.28] hours later you can get you're so weak
[2006.56 - 2010.16] you can get up that's that's that's a
[2008.28 - 2013.00] version of
[2010.16 - 2015.16] pots the reason why the heartbeat raises
[2013.00 - 2017.76] when you get off the ground or you get
[2015.16 - 2019.40] off the bed and your heart jumps up 30
[2017.76 - 2021.24] beats per minute just from standing up
[2019.40 - 2023.12] or 40 beats first of all the heart jumps
[2021.24 - 2025.60] up for everybody no matter who it is if
[2023.12 - 2026.88] you are laying down and you get up your
[2025.60 - 2029.00] heart's going to jump up a little bit
[2026.88 - 2031.64] anyway but for people with pots it jumps
[2029.00 - 2033.88] up a lot higher the reason why is the
[2031.64 - 2036.24] heart's working harder because the
[2033.88 - 2038.16] amount of saturation of poison in the
[2036.24 - 2040.32] liver going into into the bloodstream
[2038.16 - 2043.72] going into the nerves the nerves being
[2040.32 - 2046.60] inflamed and nerves being inflamed and
[2043.72 - 2049.44] the neurotoxins inflaming everything it
[2046.60 - 2052.92] it makes it hard the heart heart has to
[2049.44 - 2054.44] work harder and then you take pots
[2052.92 - 2059.52] somebody with pots and you put them on
[2054.44 - 2061.72] an asinine trendy dumb diet I know I say
[2059.52 - 2064.00] you know probably not the best thing
[2061.72 - 2065.88] sometimes yeah I told Spirit when I was
[2064.00 - 2068.32] young that I can't
[2065.88 - 2070.28] change I'm going to say stupid things
[2068.32 - 2072.48] once in a while spirit said that's okay
[2070.28 - 2074.28] as long as you got the information right
[2072.48 - 2075.84] spirit said that's all right I said I'm
[2074.28 - 2077.88] also going to you know be
[2075.84 - 2079.96] sarcastic and spirit said that's okay if
[2077.88 - 2081.52] that's what you have to do Anthony to
[2079.96 - 2083.04] deal with this and survive this gift
[2081.52 - 2085.12] that's what you have to do this gift for
[2083.04 - 2087.00] the people to survive this information
[2085.12 - 2088.36] that's coming through I said yeah I'm
[2087.00 - 2091.00] going to be sarcastic and I'm not going
[2088.36 - 2092.32] to be always you know I don't know my
[2091.00 - 2095.64] words aren't going to be always so
[2092.32 - 2098.36] perfect I'm not a scholar I didn't go to
[2095.64 - 2099.60] Harvard and
[2098.36 - 2101.04] but what happens is when you put
[2099.60 - 2104.76] somebody with
[2101.04 - 2107.12] pots on a diet that's
[2104.76 - 2110.12] trending that's trying to fix everything
[2107.12 - 2111.44] out there it's not a good thing if you
[2110.12 - 2116.16] what I'm talking about a diet that's
[2111.44 - 2117.96] trending a low carb diet a low carb diet
[2116.16 - 2119.68] now with pots you don't want to use a
[2117.96 - 2122.44] carb that could feed a virus so you
[2119.68 - 2126.92] don't want to use chocolate cake to feed
[2122.44 - 2128.52] a virus you know lard inside the cake
[2126.92 - 2130.80] you got lard in there you got wheat
[2128.52 - 2133.48] gluten you got preservatives you got
[2130.80 - 2135.80] something in the fondant on the top of
[2133.48 - 2138.28] the cake fondant made out of
[2135.80 - 2141.32] preservatives dyes and
[2138.28 - 2143.64] chemicals natural flavorings unnatural
[2141.32 - 2146.08] flavorings preservatives you name it got
[2143.64 - 2147.52] fondant on there you know I I was
[2146.08 - 2149.72] actually over a family member's house
[2147.52 - 2152.36] and they had one of those shows on one
[2149.72 - 2154.12] of those cake making shows so I think
[2152.36 - 2155.68] there's a couple of them out there they
[2154.12 - 2157.96] had one of these cake making shows on
[2155.68 - 2158.92] there and I was watching it they were
[2157.96 - 2160.48] you know they're playing around with
[2158.92 - 2161.64] tons and tons of fondant you know and
[2160.48 - 2163.56] they're doing I don't even know if
[2161.64 - 2164.68] that's what you call it and they're just
[2163.56 - 2166.52] you know they're just doing all this
[2164.68 - 2168.00] kind of stuff in it and and and and I
[2166.52 - 2169.72] said to Spirit I said hey here's your
[2168.00 - 2172.40] favorite spirit says I hate when you
[2169.72 - 2174.20] watch these shows and I said and spirit
[2172.40 - 2176.44] do say hate spirit says a different word
[2174.20 - 2178.04] and that I'm just voicing out what what
[2176.44 - 2182.12] the word equates
[2178.04 - 2184.44] to and spirit said yeah and and you know
[2182.12 - 2185.80] because of what's in those fondant
[2184.44 - 2189.56] what's in the and then what's in the
[2185.80 - 2192.16] cake because can feed it can feed a
[2189.56 - 2193.72] virus like Epstein bar nobody knows that
[2192.16 - 2196.12] nobody even to this day nobody knows
[2193.72 - 2198.24] viruses eat anything it's only coming
[2196.12 - 2200.76] from Spirit and if you hear it out there
[2198.24 - 2202.24] it came from me one way or another and
[2200.76 - 2203.36] you know and the thing it's always
[2202.24 - 2206.08] important to know that so you don't get
[2203.36 - 2208.44] sidetracked onto a whole different place
[2206.08 - 2211.16] of of information that's also got
[2208.44 - 2213.56] misinformation just riddled in it and
[2211.16 - 2215.84] anyway the chocolate cake is a carb bad
[2213.56 - 2217.84] carb it's got bad fat in there also bad
[2215.84 - 2220.56] carbohydrates in there there but these
[2217.84 - 2222.16] low carb diets are a nightmare for
[2220.56 - 2225.72] somebody with pots because people with
[2222.16 - 2228.16] pots their adrenals are tired their
[2225.72 - 2230.72] nervous system is is in desperate need
[2228.16 - 2234.56] of glucose which is sugar which is
[2230.72 - 2236.52] carbs their liver can't handle fats
[2234.56 - 2239.04] their liver can't handle fats I'm
[2236.52 - 2242.92] telling you right now
[2239.04 - 2245.88] secrets and and you put them on a high
[2242.92 - 2248.20] fat diet and take away all their carbs
[2245.88 - 2250.16] it's like if it's bad for somebody with
[2248.20 - 2251.92] pots of course the good part about that
[2250.16 - 2254.56] diet is you're taking away the bad
[2251.92 - 2257.24] processed foods the fried foods you're
[2254.56 - 2258.96] taking away cheap sugar you're taking
[2257.24 - 2260.76] away stuff like that which does matter
[2258.96 - 2262.88] for somebody with pots but you also
[2260.76 - 2265.00] leave them without what they do need to
[2262.88 - 2267.28] heal even if they experience better
[2265.00 - 2268.56] symptoms at first in order to heal
[2267.28 - 2271.20] completely they're going to have to have
[2268.56 - 2273.28] a carb this is one of the great mistakes
[2271.20 - 2277.84] of alternative medicine right now is the
[2273.28 - 2281.04] low carb Trend train which is absolutely
[2277.84 - 2284.76] Ely ridiculously
[2281.04 - 2287.00] wrong so it's important to know this
[2284.76 - 2290.28] that means fruit is an answer to someone
[2287.00 - 2293.04] recovering with pots fruit is antiviral
[2290.28 - 2295.28] antibacterial yes it is whether anybody
[2293.04 - 2297.00] likes it or not it is and I'm going to
[2295.28 - 2298.84] tell you now not just fruit but you got
[2297.00 - 2300.68] the leafy greens but that's not a carb I
[2298.84 - 2302.84] get that but the starchy vegetables are
[2300.68 - 2306.60] okay too a little bit of potato that's
[2302.84 - 2308.84] right sweet potatoes that's right um
[2306.60 - 2311.92] sweet potatoes winter squash once again
[2308.84 - 2313.56] that's right and these are really
[2311.92 - 2315.68] important for that and you got to keep
[2313.56 - 2318.36] the animal protein down somebody with
[2315.68 - 2320.08] pots you got to minimize it it's even
[2318.36 - 2321.68] good even to go off it completely with
[2320.08 - 2324.76] somebody with pots but you got to
[2321.68 - 2325.84] minimize it you do if you really like it
[2324.76 - 2327.80] you still got to minimize it you got to
[2325.84 - 2330.00] make because you got to make room for
[2327.80 - 2331.84] these other foods that are antiviral not
[2330.00 - 2333.16] because I don't like animal protein for
[2331.84 - 2335.52] somebody it's because you want to get
[2333.16 - 2338.60] rid of these foods that are antiviral
[2335.52 - 2341.72] and you never want to eat eggs with pots
[2338.60 - 2343.64] and you never want to eat bacon with
[2341.72 - 2345.88] pots you never want to eat dairy
[2343.64 - 2347.84] products with pots these feed viruses
[2345.88 - 2350.72] the bacon is so high in fat that it'll
[2347.84 - 2354.20] just wreak havoc but the the eggs the
[2350.72 - 2355.80] dairy products will feed Epstein bar the
[2354.20 - 2359.40] virus that causes
[2355.80 - 2362.72] pots it's not just that it's the weak
[2359.40 - 2367.28] gluten feeds epin bar it's too much corn
[2362.72 - 2371.92] feeds Epstein bar which is bad with p
[2367.28 - 2373.48] thoughts or any kind of disautonomia any
[2371.92 - 2375.80] kind of
[2373.48 - 2378.76] disautonomia
[2375.80 - 2380.72] seriously and that's important to know
[2378.76 - 2382.36] so we got to be careful we got to be
[2380.72 - 2384.52] careful with the
[2382.36 - 2386.72] foods one of the greatest things for
[2384.52 - 2388.36] pots ever is celery juice now it's not a
[2386.72 - 2389.92] calorie so if you drink a celery and
[2388.36 - 2391.84] don't have any calories man you're going
[2389.92 - 2394.84] to hit the wall but when you drink
[2391.84 - 2396.64] celery the mineral salts count for
[2394.84 - 2398.88] repairing the central nervous system in
[2396.64 - 2401.08] the brain for somebody with pots I got
[2398.88 - 2402.28] to finish my celery juice right here and
[2401.08 - 2405.04] I got it in my
[2402.28 - 2407.88] hand and um I've been bringing my celery
[2405.04 - 2410.52] juice to the show a lot more a lot more
[2407.88 - 2412.84] meaning in my hand like a fresh glass of
[2410.52 - 2414.56] it I drink it in the morning I don't do
[2412.84 - 2417.24] the show in the morning I do the show
[2414.56 - 2422.64] obviously my time you know my time in
[2417.24 - 2425.00] the uh afternoon over here in the US and
[2422.64 - 2428.24] you know and and but I'm asking my
[2425.00 - 2432.28] assistant can I have some juice now for
[2428.24 - 2434.08] the show and um because it reminds me of
[2432.28 - 2436.04] how powerful it is too you know what it
[2434.08 - 2437.76] does the mineral salts subgroups of
[2436.04 - 2439.80] mineral salts undiscovered by research
[2437.76 - 2442.04] and science because instead of putting
[2439.80 - 2443.68] instead of putting $500 million in
[2442.04 - 2446.20] figuring out what's why celery is a
[2443.68 - 2447.80] miracle cure you take $500 million and
[2446.20 - 2450.08] stick it into genes once more so you can
[2447.80 - 2454.00] insult people in their hereditary
[2450.08 - 2457.28] traits it's amazing it's amazing
[2454.00 - 2458.84] sick but you know the celery reboots the
[2457.28 - 2461.52] central nervous system but it's not
[2458.84 - 2464.00] enough you need to have a sugar you need
[2461.52 - 2466.36] to have glucose see the nervous system
[2464.00 - 2470.20] demands glucose which is guess what a
[2466.36 - 2472.12] carbohydrate that's right that's right
[2470.20 - 2474.16] that's right for those high-fat trending
[2472.12 - 2476.32] you know people out there high fat high
[2474.16 - 2478.40] fat high fat I get it I get it listen I
[2476.32 - 2480.00] get it if someone who eats a regular
[2478.40 - 2481.40] standard American diet filled with all
[2480.00 - 2483.08] kinds of garbage pizza and everything
[2481.40 - 2484.60] else they want to lose weight they want
[2483.08 - 2486.32] to start getting in shape they don't
[2484.60 - 2488.96] really have any illnesses that are ser
[2486.32 - 2491.24] ious or or confining them so they go to
[2488.96 - 2493.04] they go to a a grand scheme of a high
[2491.24 - 2494.76] fat trending diet they get rid of their
[2493.04 - 2496.36] processed food they hop on the treadmill
[2494.76 - 2497.92] and they start working out every day
[2496.36 - 2500.12] they think they found the holy Grill I
[2497.92 - 2502.44] get it and I'm happy for them because I
[2500.12 - 2504.12] want them to quit the processed food in
[2502.44 - 2505.56] the garbage but if they developed a
[2504.12 - 2506.92] health problem or had a real health
[2505.56 - 2508.24] problem behind it all that's not going
[2506.92 - 2510.48] to be the answer in the end they got to
[2508.24 - 2512.96] lower the animal fat lower the high
[2510.48 - 2514.68] protein down the fat down in the diet
[2512.96 - 2516.24] and raise the fruits and vegetables on
[2514.68 - 2517.48] the other end of it and that's what
[2516.24 - 2519.68] what's happening you'll see some of the
[2517.48 - 2521.40] trending higher fat diets being more
[2519.68 - 2524.60] vegetables and they allow you more
[2521.40 - 2526.32] berries and more green apples because
[2524.60 - 2527.64] they're starting to realize that people
[2526.32 - 2529.96] are getting a little better the more of
[2527.64 - 2532.00] that you add in and then when you add in
[2529.96 - 2533.56] most of it and you're getting majority
[2532.00 - 2535.96] of it all the fruits and the vegetables
[2533.56 - 2538.00] and the green juices and lots lots of
[2535.96 - 2540.92] those carbs that everybody's afraid of
[2538.00 - 2543.92] you heal from neurological
[2540.92 - 2546.36] disautonomia conditions like pots and so
[2543.92 - 2548.56] forth and celery juice combined with the
[2546.36 - 2550.96] fruit like banana can actually heal
[2548.56 - 2552.88] somebody with pots banana kills Epstein
[2550.96 - 2556.16] bar and it restores the nervous system
[2552.88 - 2558.36] with somebody with pots so then you can
[2556.16 - 2561.24] actually heal
[2558.36 - 2564.40] them but Banana's taken away all the
[2561.24 - 2567.56] trending diets take it away out of
[2564.40 - 2569.24] ignorance out of ignorance due to a
[2567.56 - 2572.56] mistake that was made about 10 or 11
[2569.24 - 2575.12] years ago from a popular popular
[2572.56 - 2578.28] practitioner Doctor Who wanted to sell
[2575.12 - 2579.92] his fruit in a pill so told everybody to
[2578.28 - 2581.24] stay away from the fruit itself that
[2579.92 - 2583.88] it's cancer
[2581.24 - 2585.88] causing and it got through the it got
[2583.88 - 2590.24] through the web it got through the
[2585.88 - 2593.00] system but so I've recovered people with
[2590.24 - 2595.88] pots to a full capacity where they're
[2593.00 - 2598.88] exercising no symptoms whatsoever ever
[2595.88 - 2602.52] again by putting them on Epstein anti
[2598.88 - 2605.80] antivirals Epstein bar anti-in bar viral
[2602.52 - 2607.48] herbs supplements and foods and got them
[2605.80 - 2609.72] on the celery juices and banana
[2607.48 - 2612.80] smoothies every
[2609.72 - 2614.60] day and got them enough calories through
[2612.80 - 2617.08] that lowered their fats where they only
[2614.60 - 2618.48] had a few seeds or or a little bit of
[2617.08 - 2621.00] avocado here and there a little bit of
[2618.48 - 2622.68] coconut oil and have recovered them from
[2621.00 - 2623.92] pots completely so they can then do what
[2622.68 - 2625.36] they want down the road if they want to
[2623.92 - 2626.96] bring in more this if they want to bring
[2625.36 - 2628.64] in more salmon they can bring in more
[2626.96 - 2630.20] salmon they want to eat something else
[2628.64 - 2632.12] they can eat it and they get their life
[2630.20 - 2635.00] back they knock their Epstein bar all
[2632.12 - 2637.28] the way down to the ground and in book
[2635.00 - 2640.76] one I got the Epstein bar chapter in
[2637.28 - 2643.56] there about Epstein bar and the thyroid
[2640.76 - 2645.88] healing I really talk about Epstein bar
[2643.56 - 2648.16] like I've never done in the history of
[2645.88 - 2650.32] any I've ever
[2648.16 - 2654.96] done and
[2650.32 - 2656.48] um yeah so it's important to know that
[2654.96 - 2657.92] you got to yeah you keep the fats low
[2656.48 - 2660.28] you got to do the antivirals what do you
[2657.92 - 2661.92] need to do little bit of zinc pots is a
[2660.28 - 2663.44] tricky thing when someone gets so weak
[2661.92 - 2666.16] they can't handle taking anything or
[2663.44 - 2668.96] even eating things sometimes because it
[2666.16 - 2671.04] takes energy takes neurological energy
[2668.96 - 2672.40] to digest neurological energy to eat
[2671.04 - 2673.84] neurological energy to take any
[2672.40 - 2675.64] supplements I understand take a little
[2673.84 - 2678.24] bit by a little bit if you got a good
[2675.64 - 2680.04] practitioner get some help but you need
[2678.24 - 2681.64] to be on the right kind of B12 you need
[2680.04 - 2683.72] to be on the right kind of
[2681.64 - 2685.32] methylfolate just go to the directory
[2683.72 - 2687.24] that medical medium.com if you don't
[2685.32 - 2688.64] know and you can you can show your
[2687.24 - 2691.96] practitioner the
[2688.64 - 2695.12] supplements that are just listed there
[2691.96 - 2696.28] so you know the right ones to take I
[2695.12 - 2700.80] don't sell them they're just just there
[2696.28 - 2702.00] for you to know and you can do a little
[2700.80 - 2704.76] bit of the B12 a little bit of the
[2702.00 - 2707.24] methola but lysine I've seen lysine be a
[2704.76 - 2710.72] miracle for people with pots lysine L
[2707.24 - 2716.56] lysine LS i n e I've seen it be a
[2710.72 - 2718.00] miracle for people so L scene I've seen
[2716.56 - 2720.56] a little bit of licorice frot be
[2718.00 - 2723.08] life-changing for some people with pots
[2720.56 - 2724.68] the lemon bomb that's Melissa I've seen
[2723.08 - 2725.96] that really be life-changing seen a
[2724.68 - 2727.68] little bit of cat's claw be life
[2725.96 - 2730.64] changing of people with pots cuz it goes
[2727.68 - 2732.20] after epine bar vitamin C if all else
[2730.64 - 2734.20] and you can't do anything and you got
[2732.20 - 2737.48] pots and you got a condition of some
[2734.20 - 2739.96] kind based around it if you can just do
[2737.48 - 2742.56] vitamin C and only vitamin C I'll be
[2739.96 - 2744.96] happy because vitamin C gets rid of the
[2742.56 - 2746.88] Epstein bar over time takes time if
[2744.96 - 2748.76] you've been in it too long it's okay
[2746.88 - 2750.64] you're going to get better we can get
[2748.76 - 2752.00] you better I've had people couldn't even
[2750.64 - 2753.68] get out of their bed their heart would
[2752.00 - 2755.64] go crazy they get out of the bed they
[2753.68 - 2758.36] could barely get enough energy to get to
[2755.64 - 2759.84] theed bathroom and pee and then come
[2758.36 - 2763.52] back to
[2759.84 - 2765.80] bed and have recovered them Spirit
[2763.52 - 2768.52] recovered them with the
[2765.80 - 2770.68] information I can't give myself credit
[2768.52 - 2772.96] because it's it's it's Spirit bottom
[2770.68 - 2774.96] line I have to always remember that one
[2772.96 - 2776.64] time I uh claimed it was all me Spirit
[2774.96 - 2779.64] taught me a good lesson in the garden I
[2776.64 - 2781.48] told you that story it's in book one had
[2779.64 - 2783.12] the neighbor over neighbor was telling
[2781.48 - 2785.32] me how he doesn't understand how I knew
[2783.12 - 2786.88] what was wrong with the wife his wife
[2785.32 - 2788.28] how she couldn't walk for years and
[2786.88 - 2789.88] spirit said it was arsenic in their
[2788.28 - 2790.88] water and their well water and nobody
[2789.88 - 2793.96] knew
[2790.88 - 2796.96] and and and he tested and the well water
[2793.96 - 2798.60] had some arsenic in it and and then we
[2796.96 - 2800.44] did Heavy Metal detox to pull out the
[2798.60 - 2802.16] Arsenic and over time she walked for the
[2800.44 - 2804.32] first time in a long long long time and
[2802.16 - 2806.24] I was in the garden bragging he said how
[2804.32 - 2807.84] do you know these answers how is it
[2806.24 - 2810.32] possible how do you know you're not even
[2807.84 - 2812.28] a doctor I said I know everything
[2810.32 - 2814.68] there's nothing I don't know I know
[2812.28 - 2817.84] everything and never forget it never
[2814.68 - 2820.32] ever forget it I'll always be right I'm
[2817.84 - 2822.60] right everybody's wrong and never forget
[2820.32 - 2824.12] it I took two steps I stepped on a rake
[2822.60 - 2826.28] like a one of those ho rake things in
[2824.12 - 2827.88] the in the garden it flipped up backward
[2826.28 - 2830.40] smacked me in the face and it knocked me
[2827.88 - 2833.76] clean out I was out cold 100% knocked
[2830.40 - 2836.52] out I didn't even have time to see stars
[2833.76 - 2838.12] that's how fast I was knocked out as I
[2836.52 - 2840.92] was waking up my neighbor was standing
[2838.12 - 2843.72] over me he was just looking at me I had
[2840.92 - 2846.40] some onions still in my hand that was
[2843.72 - 2850.16] pulling out of the garden and Spirit
[2846.40 - 2852.40] then said remember this I'm always right
[2850.16 - 2854.20] you're always wrong I'm always right
[2852.40 - 2856.24] you're always wrong and spirit knows I'm
[2854.20 - 2857.56] not always wrong I got my own ideas and
[2856.24 - 2859.00] I got my own thoughts and I could be
[2857.56 - 2862.28] right about something but Spirit was
[2859.00 - 2866.28] making it clear when it comes down to
[2862.28 - 2869.52] this this part in my life spirit's
[2866.28 - 2870.84] always right and I was wrong and I T I
[2869.52 - 2872.64] would learned the lesson so I got to
[2870.84 - 2874.36] give Spirit credit cuz I don't want to
[2872.64 - 2875.80] step on another rake in the garden cuz I
[2874.36 - 2880.08] do like the garden whenever I get it
[2875.80 - 2881.92] chance once in a blue moon um so listen
[2880.08 - 2883.44] you take it one day at a time with pots
[2881.92 - 2884.84] you have to have faith number one the
[2883.44 - 2886.48] faith and the hope and the faith and the
[2884.84 - 2888.40] hope and you also have to have the truth
[2886.48 - 2890.28] that your body's not attacking itself
[2888.40 - 2893.16] you got a bug in you it's been in there
[2890.28 - 2895.32] for a while big deal meaning your
[2893.16 - 2898.12] symptoms are a big deal I get it but the
[2895.32 - 2900.16] bug isn't you not we knock it down one
[2898.12 - 2901.76] thing I learned from Spirit right from
[2900.16 - 2903.64] the beginning and I'm going to tell you
[2901.76 - 2906.04] right now one thing I learned from
[2903.64 - 2907.68] Spirit right from the beginning is when
[2906.04 - 2910.60] you know what's wrong inside your body
[2907.68 - 2912.64] your body kicks it up a notch when you
[2910.60 - 2915.88] know it's a bug your immune system knows
[2912.64 - 2917.64] it's a bug as well it already knows it's
[2915.88 - 2919.68] a bug your immune system that's why it
[2917.64 - 2921.36] even creates an antibody to go after the
[2919.68 - 2923.40] bug not to go after you to harm you or
[2921.36 - 2925.12] to hurt you ever but it knows it's B but
[2923.40 - 2928.04] when it knows you know too and the two
[2925.12 - 2929.64] things combine the soul the heart of
[2928.04 - 2931.88] someone and the spirit of someone
[2929.64 - 2933.48] combines with the knowledge of knowing
[2931.88 - 2937.60] it's a virus you're going to squash and
[2933.48 - 2937.60] your body's squashing guess what happen
[2938.44 - 2944.84] guess what happens come on guess I know
[2942.24 - 2947.04] some of you are but not everybody is
[2944.84 - 2949.44] yeah you win the battle you destroy the
[2947.04 - 2951.84] virus you knock it down your immune
[2949.44 - 2954.92] system gets even stronger that's what
[2951.84 - 2954.92] happens all of that and the
[2955.04 - 2964.08] above and uh and never forget
[2960.00 - 2966.28] it never forget it so cucumber juice is
[2964.08 - 2969.00] great too you can do that look do teas
[2966.28 - 2971.08] herbal teas very helpful for for pots
[2969.00 - 2972.92] any kind of herbal tea you like you can
[2971.08 - 2975.20] do a little bit of golden seal for pots
[2972.92 - 2979.12] periodically I do like that that's not
[2975.20 - 2981.72] bad at all you can do that um and and
[2979.12 - 2983.64] and that's fine and but what I like what
[2981.72 - 2986.08] I like for pots is anything onion if you
[2983.64 - 2988.12] can handle any kind of onion any kind of
[2986.08 - 2991.88] like a chive or a little bit of a
[2988.12 - 2994.64] scallion very helpful for pots um eating
[2991.88 - 2996.88] every 45 minutes for pots is critical
[2994.64 - 2999.40] meaning s something eating something
[2996.88 - 3001.36] snacking on something every 45 minutes
[2999.40 - 3002.96] whether it's a banana and a celery stick
[3001.36 - 3005.60] whether it's a handful of nuts and seeds
[3002.96 - 3007.72] and a celery stick whether it's an apple
[3005.60 - 3010.04] apple and a handful of seeds whether
[3007.72 - 3012.40] it's Apple handful of hemp seeds whether
[3010.04 - 3014.28] it's an apple and a cucumber cucumber
[3012.40 - 3016.16] slices and apple whether it's you know
[3014.28 - 3018.64] juice if you can find some juice
[3016.16 - 3021.60] whatever it is eating every 45 minutes
[3018.64 - 3024.20] to an hour snacking and grazing is
[3021.60 - 3026.72] critical for pots critical sitting up
[3024.20 - 3028.76] when you can sit get up when you can
[3026.72 - 3031.24] walk when you can it's never going to be
[3028.76 - 3034.00] perfect at the beginning take walks one
[3031.24 - 3036.36] of the reasons it gets harder with pots
[3034.00 - 3038.16] is because it's like kind of it's very
[3036.36 - 3040.36] similar to other kinds of nervous system
[3038.16 - 3042.84] disorders because it's it's neurological
[3040.36 - 3045.00] to Epstein bar related what happens is
[3042.84 - 3046.88] you lose muscle and your body's not used
[3045.00 - 3051.08] to doing anything because you were
[3046.88 - 3053.68] inhibited prohibited from doing
[3051.08 - 3056.76] anything so excuse me so you were
[3053.68 - 3060.12] prohibited from doing it
[3056.76 - 3061.92] anything and what happened was you know
[3060.12 - 3063.24] it it doesn't help it kind of works
[3061.92 - 3064.36] against you and that's perfectly fine
[3063.24 - 3065.88] because if you do too much you're going
[3064.36 - 3068.00] to pay for it I get it you're not going
[3065.88 - 3069.44] to be able to do good function you're
[3068.00 - 3071.92] going to be wiped out taking a show
[3069.44 - 3074.04] wipes you out stand when you can when
[3071.92 - 3077.56] you can walk a little bit when you can
[3074.04 - 3079.60] each day it helps retrain the body while
[3077.56 - 3081.76] you're healing if you can't do it you do
[3079.60 - 3084.40] a little bit at a time I I knew somebody
[3081.76 - 3086.08] all they could do is just draw draw they
[3084.40 - 3087.40] could sit up for a half hour and draw
[3086.08 - 3088.80] and then they had to go back down
[3087.40 - 3090.56] absolutely but that sitting up and
[3088.80 - 3092.12] drawing for half an hour made a huge
[3090.56 - 3093.68] difference it was the beginning of their
[3092.12 - 3095.20] healing process and when you add
[3093.68 - 3098.44] everything else into it a little bit by
[3095.20 - 3100.68] little you heal and you move
[3098.44 - 3102.20] forward so yeah so that's where we are
[3100.68 - 3104.80] with pots we're coming to the end of the
[3102.20 - 3107.76] show check out the Instagram you know
[3104.80 - 3109.40] with everybody's stories check it out
[3107.76 - 3112.12] and uh Facebook I'm on there fooling
[3109.40 - 3114.16] around all the time on Instagram and I
[3112.12 - 3115.68] think somebody said somebody said on
[3114.16 - 3120.00] Facebook one day they said is this
[3115.68 - 3123.32] really you and I I typed back yeah it's
[3120.00 - 3125.00] me with a heart you know oh oh here's
[3123.32 - 3126.76] what's really funny somebody said this
[3125.00 - 3128.40] can't be Anthony a guy said this can't
[3126.76 - 3130.16] be Anthony on Facebook because Anthony
[3128.40 - 3132.68] would never do hearts what are you
[3130.16 - 3135.52] kidding I love doing the hearts I love
[3132.68 - 3138.68] the hearts heart emojis I love those the
[3135.52 - 3140.20] red ones love those I love those and you
[3138.68 - 3142.28] know so on Facebook that's what I do I
[3140.20 - 3144.36] do the heart emojis I do the happy faces
[3142.28 - 3146.48] do other things too I'm on there I'm in
[3144.36 - 3148.20] there if you see I don't answer a really
[3146.48 - 3149.84] serious in depth question it's because I
[3148.20 - 3152.36] can't answer it because it would take I
[3149.84 - 3154.60] can't do a whole thesis some some people
[3152.36 - 3156.40] they ask me a question I'm like wow I
[3154.60 - 3158.52] know what the answer is to that question
[3156.40 - 3160.20] but it's going to take probably about 10
[3158.52 - 3162.12] minutes 15 minutes and it's going to
[3160.20 - 3165.32] probably take like a page two three
[3162.12 - 3167.44] pages of writing and um that's hard to
[3165.32 - 3169.04] do that's hard to do so just know that
[3167.44 - 3170.92] I'm there though and I try to answer
[3169.04 - 3174.24] questions that I can that seem to be
[3170.92 - 3176.92] brief enough um it's hard for me to do a
[3174.24 - 3179.24] a very very long you know a very long
[3176.92 - 3181.44] whole thing a thesis on an illness or a
