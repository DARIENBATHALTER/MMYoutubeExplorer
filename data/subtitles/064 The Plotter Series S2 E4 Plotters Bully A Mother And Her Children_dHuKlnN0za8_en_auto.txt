[46.64 - 52.56] false stories and claims about me and
[50.52 - 55.56] about medical medium information to
[52.56 - 58.52] Major media outlets in hopes that it
[55.56 - 61.32] would lead to securing themselves a deal
[58.52 - 64.48] for an anti-ed medium documentary on
[61.32 - 68.44] Netflix that would bring Fame and other
[64.48 - 70.60] benefits to them now known infamously

[218.32 - 223.00] is a highly respected holistic health
[220.44 - 225.52] practitioner and speech pathologist and
[223.00 - 228.68] was a friend of Stephanie's her name is
[225.52 - 230.84] Dr Kimberly spare Kim and her husband
[228.68 - 233.88] supported Stephanie at the time of her
[230.84 - 236.40] illness back in 2020 Ashley posted her
[233.88 - 239.08] original false story about Stephanie
[236.40 - 241.52] which she made more than 15 false claims
[239.08 - 244.88] in one vers version of and told more
[241.52 - 246.96] than 20 falsehoods in another version of
[244.88 - 248.92] Kimberly's husband corrected Ashley in
[246.96 - 251.52] the comments on something she had gotten
[248.92 - 254.52] very wrong and Ashley had to adjust her
[251.52 - 256.84] false story because of it Kimberly made
[254.52 - 259.40] a statement to her own small private
[256.84 - 262.32] Community to calm fears and Chaos that
[259.40 - 264.80] Ashley had created with her false story
[262.32 - 267.12] Ashley was not happy about this and she
[264.80 - 270.28] responded by attacking Kim and trying to
[267.12 - 272.76] intimidate her to this day Ashley has
[270.28 - 275.56] continued to publicly attack Kimberly
[272.76 - 277.68] and her family Kimberly thank you for
[275.56 - 279.40] coming on to share your story I know
[277.68 - 281.76] that this situation has been extremely
[279.40 - 284.72] upsetting thank you Amber this is a
[281.76 - 286.72] really sad situation a dear friend that
[284.72 - 288.72] I cared about is being used for an
[286.72 - 291.16] agenda that seems to have been created
[288.72 - 293.08] years after her passing I would have
[291.16 - 295.56] never shared the intimate details of her
[293.08 - 298.44] story because Stephanie's privacy is my
[295.56 - 300.68] number one concern however the plotters
[298.44 - 303.24] have shared very intimate details of
[300.68 - 306.60] Stephanie's story and even delicate
[303.24 - 308.84] unnecessary details about her life I was
[306.60 - 312.08] recently attacked and have been
[308.84 - 314.24] continually attacked since 2020 the
[312.08 - 317.40] attacks were sudden they were out of the
[314.24 - 319.80] blue I was actually really shocked when
[317.40 - 322.04] they began I felt it was really
[319.80 - 323.88] necessary for me to set a few things
[322.04 - 327.72] straight here
[323.88 - 330.12] today yeah could you start Kim by
[327.72 - 331.92] telling us first about your relationship
[330.12 - 334.56] with Stephanie and how you were
[331.92 - 338.76] supporting her when she was
[334.56 - 341.48] sick yeah so we met actually at Ashley's
[338.76 - 344.04] home during the LA medical medium event
[341.48 - 346.20] Stephanie and I became instant friends
[344.04 - 348.12] we realized that we lived just one state
[346.20 - 350.96] over from each other and that she had a
[348.12 - 354.40] nephew that was very close in age to my
[350.96 - 357.76] son we started texting and voice texting
[354.40 - 360.24] a lot Stephanie was sweet she was funny
[357.76 - 362.84] she was loving and she was always
[360.24 - 365.52] looking for advice but she was also
[362.84 - 368.08] always offering to help in any way that
[365.52 - 370.08] she could I would meet up with Stephanie
[368.08 - 372.72] for lunch at the grocery store juice
[370.08 - 375.00] bars and I met up with her the night
[372.72 - 376.36] that her niece was born at the hospital
[375.00 - 378.08] to arm her with the things that she
[376.36 - 378.96] wanted to support her sister-in-law
[378.08 - 381.80] through
[378.96 - 383.80] Labor a few months later I met her
[381.80 - 386.24] sister-in-law niece and nephew for a
[383.80 - 388.24] lunch date and we bounced together along
[386.24 - 390.08] with her family and my family at her
[388.24 - 392.88] nephew's birthday party
[390.08 - 395.28] Stephanie was so so proud of her niece
[392.88 - 396.72] and nephew and wanted me to be friends
[395.28 - 398.92] with her sister-in-law because she
[396.72 - 401.32] thought we had so much in common and we
[398.92 - 404.00] had kids that were really close in
[401.32 - 406.64] age I adored Stephanie and the
[404.00 - 409.04] friendship that we shared I soon became
[406.64 - 411.28] pregnant with my second child and
[409.04 - 413.92] Stephanie volunteered to help me
[411.28 - 415.40] postpartum with my 2-year-old son the
[413.92 - 417.76] same way that she supported her
[415.40 - 419.88] sister-in-law and her nephew because she
[417.76 - 421.68] told me I helped to support her and her
[419.88 - 424.16] brother and her brother's family
[421.68 - 427.92] postpartum and that I also needed that
[424.16 - 430.36] same help she was always so gentle so
[427.92 - 432.52] kind and always questioned how I was
[430.36 - 434.96] working full-time how I was pregnant and
[432.52 - 438.56] also caring for a two-year-old she got
[434.96 - 441.72] it and it meant so much to
[438.56 - 443.56] me when Stephanie got sick I remember
[441.72 - 445.56] discussing doctors with her and offering
[443.56 - 448.84] to go with her into the City and hold
[445.56 - 452.40] her hand but Stephanie was not receptive
[448.84 - 456.40] to the idea of seeing a doctor at that
[452.40 - 457.96] time wow and then what was happening and
[456.40 - 459.40] what were things like after Stephanie
[457.96 - 462.76] got
[459.40 - 465.68] sick so this was really hard when
[462.76 - 468.40] Stephanie took a turn for the worst I
[465.68 - 470.64] was getting ready to birth my baby I was
[468.40 - 472.76] planning a vack birth as my first birth
[470.64 - 475.32] was a traumatic emergency birth and the
[472.76 - 478.48] stress of what I'm about to explain was
[475.32 - 481.76] impacting my ability to birth my baby I
[478.48 - 483.52] was under so much pressure and I was
[481.76 - 485.80] having such a hard time shifting into
[483.52 - 488.48] birth mode as I was on constant group
[485.80 - 490.28] messages with then friends colleagues
[488.48 - 492.88] medical doctors consultants and
[490.28 - 497.32] personally with Stephanie to support her
[492.88 - 500.20] as best I could the pressure was never
[497.32 - 503.48] ever from Stephanie it was coming from
[500.20 - 505.84] several of the plotters mostly Ashley
[503.48 - 508.00] who lived across the country they were
[505.84 - 509.60] looking at a map and telling me that I
[508.00 - 511.84] live an hour and 20 minutes from
[509.60 - 514.08] Stephanie but in reality with City
[511.84 - 517.88] traffic this often times could take up
[514.08 - 519.64] to 4 hours each way this is why when
[517.88 - 521.96] Stephanie and I did meet up before she
[519.64 - 524.12] was sick we were always extremely
[521.96 - 525.88] strategic about our planning the city
[524.12 - 528.32] traffic where we live is
[525.88 - 531.16] horrendous and the driving around here
[528.32 - 535.16] during the city traffic it's it's just
[531.16 - 537.28] crazy so back to my birth I was
[535.16 - 540.32] literally in the birthing tub birthing
[537.28 - 542.88] my baby on text threads with Stephanie
[540.32 - 544.64] and with her supporters several of which
[542.88 - 547.64] are now involved in trying to take this
[544.64 - 550.40] community down when I finally birthed my
[547.64 - 552.68] baby I was back on the text threads
[550.40 - 555.04] within minutes planning how I could best
[552.68 - 559.88] support Stephanie this was before my
[555.04 - 559.88] family or my son had even met my new
[560.16 - 564.84] daughter I was under so much pressure
[562.80 - 567.04] before I was even cleared to drive by my
[564.84 - 569.56] midwives I was back on my feet caring
[567.04 - 571.16] for my newborn caring for my 2-year-old
[569.56 - 573.76] and driving food and teas and
[571.16 - 575.48] supplements that Stephanie wanted to her
[573.76 - 578.64] whenever I
[575.48 - 581.12] could Stephanie herself did not want me
[578.64 - 583.84] doing this but the plotters continued to
[581.12 - 586.12] push me like I was some type of robot
[583.84 - 589.36] that should birth a baby and then be
[586.12 - 591.68] back to running around I also opened up
[589.36 - 596.56] my home to a house guest when I was only
[591.68 - 598.36] a few weeks postpartum a friend Gretchen
[596.56 - 599.88] she came to my house and stayed with me
[598.36 - 602.52] so that she could support
[599.88 - 605.64] Stephanie my husband and I gave up a car
[602.52 - 607.24] we ran errands on no sleep we also
[605.64 - 609.60] opened our home to
[607.24 - 611.52] illness as greten was in and out of the
[609.60 - 613.84] hospital and then back in our home
[611.52 - 616.36] around my newborn we all came down with
[613.84 - 619.00] a flu when my baby was just a few weeks
[616.36 - 621.52] old my 2-year-old was also sick it was
[619.00 - 624.52] one of the hardest experiences of my
[621.52 - 626.60] life being postpartum having a baby
[624.52 - 630.16] being exposed to a
[626.60 - 633.08] flu on one trip to pick up Gretchen
[630.16 - 636.28] again before I was cleared to drive I
[633.08 - 637.56] was so tired that I went to pump gas
[636.28 - 640.60] near Stephanie's
[637.56 - 644.68] home the gas station was old and the
[640.60 - 647.44] pump was malfunctioning and I was
[644.68 - 650.08] exhausted I grabbed the noble nozzle and
[647.44 - 653.16] I pressed it a few times before it
[650.08 - 656.96] turned on soaking me in gasoline my hair
[653.16 - 659.84] was soaked my clothes were soaked I was
[656.96 - 663.20] drenched from head to toe I was sprayed
[659.84 - 666.40] in the eyes and I felt like I couldn't
[663.20 - 669.32] breathe I was shaking from the freezing
[666.40 - 672.40] temperatures my newborn she was in the
[669.32 - 675.08] back seat breathing in all the
[672.40 - 677.76] fumes I rushed to Stephanie's house with
[675.08 - 680.48] my windows down freezing
[677.76 - 682.68] shaking and I had to shower and wear
[680.48 - 686.08] someone else's clothes
[682.68 - 687.72] home the whole time period it was
[686.08 - 692.32] totally
[687.72 - 694.84] insane I had a baby a baby a newborn
[692.32 - 698.96] that was just a few weeks old and a
[694.84 - 701.44] 2-year-old son and I was being pushed by
[698.96 - 704.80] women across the country mostly Ashley
[701.44 - 706.92] to do more and more I had already been
[704.80 - 709.24] supporting Stephanie in every way that I
[706.92 - 711.00] could I had given her money I had
[709.24 - 712.80] purchased supplements that she wanted
[711.00 - 714.60] and couldn't afford I was cooking her
[712.80 - 716.80] meals when I could bringing her teas
[714.60 - 718.52] when I could my husband even took food
[716.80 - 720.32] to the hospital at one point just days
[718.52 - 722.92] after my daughter was
[720.32 - 724.68] born he felt extremely uncomfortable in
[722.92 - 726.60] the hospital as Stephanie wanted to talk
[724.68 - 728.84] to him and welcome the food but he felt
[726.60 - 732.16] so mixed up in a situation where some of
[728.84 - 735.48] the plotters were screaming at her
[732.16 - 737.44] family one of the plotters Taylor was
[735.48 - 739.24] attacking Stephanie's father having a
[737.44 - 741.52] heated discussion while disagreeing with
[739.24 - 744.32] Stephanie's father about her
[741.52 - 746.24] treatment my husband during those days
[744.32 - 748.16] was rushing home from work so that he or
[746.24 - 750.16] I could run things we could move cars we
[748.16 - 752.76] could run errands we can manage house
[750.16 - 755.12] guests cook meals run guests back and
[752.76 - 757.72] forth with a baby and a 2-year-old I
[755.12 - 760.28] wanted to do everything for
[757.72 - 762.20] Stephanie but Ashley was creating a
[760.28 - 764.80] pressure on me that almost broke me
[762.20 - 764.80] during that
[765.08 - 771.12] time
[766.80 - 773.88] wow there's so much to unpack here from
[771.12 - 776.56] this story and it sounds like such an
[773.88 - 780.12] unbelievably stressful and traumatic
[776.56 - 781.52] time having gasoline sprayed all over
[780.12 - 783.24] your body like that when your body's
[781.52 - 786.32] already compromised from having just
[783.24 - 788.44] given birth let alone when you're
[786.32 - 791.48] breastfeeding it's a
[788.44 - 795.16] tremendous exposure I can't even imagine
[791.48 - 797.24] I would have been devastated and despite
[795.16 - 799.08] having just given birth you and your
[797.24 - 800.80] husband were both doing the best that
[799.08 - 803.64] you could to help Stephanie while she
[800.80 - 806.96] was sick you weren't cleared to even
[803.64 - 810.04] drive yet and you did it anyway the
[806.96 - 811.92] drive wasn't short I want to bring in a
[810.04 - 814.64] text that we have from Stephanie she had
[811.92 - 816.96] sent it to a friend this was from before
[814.64 - 818.92] she had gotten sick and she was talking
[816.96 - 822.08] about some items that she was thinking
[818.92 - 824.60] about picking up from you and she says
[822.08 - 826.96] okay cool she isn't super close so may
[824.60 - 830.28] not get it unless it's super
[826.96 - 832.40] important this text corroborates this
[830.28 - 834.12] text from Stephanie corroborates the
[832.40 - 836.36] fact that you were far enough away from
[834.12 - 838.68] her that it would have been a hassle for
[836.36 - 840.52] her to pick up items from your house if
[838.68 - 842.72] they weren't super
[840.52 - 844.64] important you said that your husband
[842.72 - 847.36] brought food to the hospital and spent
[844.64 - 849.48] time around the family you both were
[847.36 - 851.56] actually there and you got to witness
[849.48 - 855.56] what was going on in person when
[851.56 - 857.40] Stephanie was sick as Ashley mainly was
[855.56 - 861.40] putting all of this pressure on you to
[857.40 - 863.60] do more and more I'm wondering where was
[861.40 - 865.48] Ashley and what was Ashley doing during
[863.60 - 868.52] the year and a half that Stephanie was
[865.48 - 871.48] sick I have actually been to Ashley's
[868.52 - 873.96] family home in Pebble Beach California
[871.48 - 877.88] but at the time I didn't know how well
[873.96 - 880.08] off she was she was actually in Malibu
[877.88 - 883.76] while Stephanie was sick she kept saying
[880.08 - 886.44] she was very far away I now wonder why
[883.76 - 889.68] she didn't offer Stephanie more support
[886.44 - 893.08] or come to see her she very well had the
[889.68 - 895.64] means to do it instead Ashley put
[893.08 - 897.84] incredible pressure on me knowing that I
[895.64 - 899.76] didn't have postpartum support I didn't
[897.84 - 902.04] have anyone there helping me supporting
[899.76 - 904.56] me Ashley and Gretchen were both
[902.04 - 906.80] marketing and running Retreats during
[904.56 - 908.84] the time of Stephanie's illness and
[906.80 - 910.76] after she passed the Retreats were out
[908.84 - 913.64] of state and they had to travel to get
[910.76 - 916.16] to them somehow Ashley could travel for
[913.64 - 918.40] the Retreats but she never made it to
[916.16 - 918.40] see
[919.56 - 926.20] Stephanie yeah so while Ashley was busy
[923.20 - 927.72] running Retreats with Gretchen in Hawaii
[926.20 - 930.32] and trying to make money off of the
[927.72 - 932.84] medical medium community she was bossing
[930.32 - 935.88] you around and putting pressure on you
[932.84 - 937.68] to help even more than you already were
[935.88 - 940.84] you and your husband were there with
[937.68 - 943.76] Stephanie and you showed up to help but
[940.84 - 945.48] Ashley on the other hand we now know
[943.76 - 947.76] that Ashley wasn't physically present
[945.48 - 950.00] for any part of Stephanie's breast lump
[947.76 - 952.24] Discovery she wasn't around for any part
[950.00 - 954.36] of Stephanie's back injury she didn't
[952.24 - 957.32] visit Stephanie in the hospital
[954.36 - 960.12] once as we covered earlier on in these
[957.32 - 962.76] podcasts Ashley the daughter of a
[960.12 - 965.04] billionaire family with a private jet
[962.76 - 968.00] was on a private jet headed to
[965.04 - 971.04] Pennsylvania where Stephanie was just a
[968.00 - 974.28] few months before Stephanie died and
[971.04 - 974.28] Ashley still didn't visit
[974.32 - 980.48] her yeah I know that Stephanie's family
[977.68 - 983.44] didn't even like Ashley or any of the
[980.48 - 984.84] Potters at the time they didn't like the
[983.44 - 987.64] way that she lived they didn't like the
[984.84 - 991.04] way that Steph ate which by the way
[987.64 - 993.36] wasn't exactly medical median she did so
[991.04 - 993.36] many
[993.88 - 1001.84] things so the family didn't like Ashley
[997.88 - 1004.32] Ashley wasn't around at all and somehow
[1001.84 - 1007.80] for some reason Ashley has tried to
[1004.32 - 1010.36] position herself as an authority on
[1007.80 - 1012.28] Stephanie I want to bring us back to
[1010.36 - 1014.24] when Ashley posted her original false
[1012.28 - 1017.48] story online in
[1014.24 - 1020.12] 2020 Ashley made more than 15 false
[1017.48 - 1023.40] claims in one verse version and more
[1020.12 - 1025.88] than 20 false claims in another version
[1023.40 - 1028.16] your husband however having firsthand
[1025.88 - 1030.24] knowledge of what had occurred corrected
[1028.16 - 1033.28] Ashley in the comments of one of her
[1030.24 - 1035.56] posts he said but you're missing the
[1033.28 - 1037.84] critical part when Anthony at Medical
[1035.56 - 1040.84] medium told her she needed to see a
[1037.84 - 1043.44] doctor and have the lump dealt with oh I
[1040.84 - 1046.56] forgot that doesn't fit your
[1043.44 - 1049.36] agenda Ashley replied to this by
[1046.56 - 1051.80] saying Anthony didn't tell her to see a
[1049.36 - 1054.28] doctor until she was bleeding from her
[1051.80 - 1057.80] nipples the same point at which he
[1054.28 - 1057.80] stopped communicating with
[1058.16 - 1064.08] her at this point in the plotter podcast
[1061.68 - 1067.88] series we all know that this is far from
[1064.08 - 1070.52] the truth to this your husband responded
[1067.88 - 1072.64] by saying I don't know the whole story
[1070.52 - 1075.72] nor claim to but if you are going to
[1072.64 - 1077.88] claim the truth needs to be out there at
[1075.72 - 1080.32] least do such a thing in its entirety
[1077.88 - 1082.28] the above is one case in point which you
[1080.32 - 1084.52] just acknowledge you skipped over and
[1082.28 - 1086.16] I'm sure there are others kind of
[1084.52 - 1089.04] calling the kettle black when you want
[1086.16 - 1091.52] to make allegations of people being
[1089.04 - 1093.72] Liars your husband called Ashley out for
[1091.52 - 1096.60] being inaccurate and falsely narrating
[1093.72 - 1099.12] the story the way that it served her
[1096.60 - 1100.92] agenda even people who didn't know what
[1099.12 - 1103.56] happened with Stephanie found Ashley's
[1100.92 - 1105.32] story to be alarmingly inconsistent with
[1103.56 - 1108.32] what they know of Anthony and medical
[1105.32 - 1109.60] medium information one person commented
[1108.32 - 1111.52] and said
[1109.60 - 1113.92] doesn't he always say to see a doctor
[1111.52 - 1114.72] and see what the diagnosis is and go
[1113.92 - 1118.04] from
[1114.72 - 1121.20] there another person added I listen to
[1118.04 - 1123.24] Anthony's podcasts and have never heard
[1121.20 - 1126.24] him suggest not to see a doctor
[1123.24 - 1128.08] conventional or otherwise I find it hard
[1126.24 - 1131.12] to believe your claim that Anthony
[1128.08 - 1134.08] explicitly told her not to see a
[1131.12 - 1136.56] doctor after all of the push back and
[1134.08 - 1139.72] being corrected by your husband Ashley
[1136.56 - 1142.84] commented this I tried to add it to my
[1139.72 - 1147.32] post but Instagram won't let me but if
[1142.84 - 1151.08] IG will allow me later I will add
[1147.32 - 1154.08] it initially Ashley left out any mention
[1151.08 - 1155.84] of any doctors being involved then here
[1154.08 - 1157.72] because of your husband's correction and
[1155.84 - 1160.60] the push back she was getting she
[1157.72 - 1163.12] changed her story and went on from there
[1160.60 - 1166.00] to say Anthony told Stephanie to see a
[1163.12 - 1168.76] doctor but not until it was too late
[1166.00 - 1171.44] which is still very far from the truth
[1168.76 - 1174.52] and with all of her blatant false claims
[1171.44 - 1177.48] Ashley caused a lot of damage one
[1174.52 - 1179.36] comment on this post read he should have
[1177.48 - 1182.24] told her to see a doctor the moment she
[1179.36 - 1185.44] found the lump and told him it should be
[1182.24 - 1187.68] a lesson for him and any healer I've
[1185.44 - 1190.48] heard similar stories many times with
[1187.68 - 1192.24] other healers I'm just so so sorry again
[1190.48 - 1194.88] to hear
[1192.24 - 1197.24] this we hope that this person has now
[1194.88 - 1200.56] listened to our podcasts to learn the
[1197.24 - 1202.40] truth even though they probably didn't
[1200.56 - 1205.40] because they're probably long gone since
[1202.40 - 1207.08] being scared by Ashley's false claims if
[1205.40 - 1210.52] they have been listening they would have
[1207.08 - 1213.76] learned that this is exactly in fact
[1210.52 - 1215.48] what Anthony did exactly one day after
[1213.76 - 1218.08] Stephanie reached out about her breast
[1215.48 - 1221.32] lump Discovery Anthony and his wife
[1218.08 - 1223.76] texted that you should always see a
[1221.32 - 1226.24] physician even after being corrected by
[1223.76 - 1229.80] her husband Ashley continued on with
[1226.24 - 1232.20] more falsities she commented this
[1229.80 - 1234.60] he told her to see a doctor when it was
[1232.20 - 1237.40] too late for them to do anything and
[1234.60 - 1240.08] when he clearly realized he had screwed
[1237.40 - 1242.40] up it was at this point that he also cut
[1240.08 - 1245.08] off communication with her it doesn't
[1242.40 - 1248.00] feel very relevant to me that after
[1245.08 - 1250.40] years of telling her not to see a doctor
[1248.00 - 1254.36] and that she would be fine he changed
[1250.40 - 1256.68] his tune when she was incredibly ill
[1254.36 - 1261.08] there are so many false things in here
[1256.68 - 1263.92] it's disturbing not a single sentence is
[1261.08 - 1266.32] accurate as we've covered Anthony told
[1263.92 - 1269.68] Stephanie to see a doctor from the very
[1266.32 - 1272.48] beginning he didn't screw up Anthony was
[1269.68 - 1274.36] consistent in his messaging to Stephanie
[1272.48 - 1277.48] all throughout the time of her illness
[1274.36 - 1280.48] that doctor should be involved he never
[1277.48 - 1282.92] changed his tune and Anthony was not the
[1280.48 - 1284.88] one who cut off communication with
[1282.92 - 1288.96] Stephanie we'll get to that more in a
[1284.88 - 1291.64] bit but my gosh Kim no wonder you had to
[1288.96 - 1293.52] make a statement I mean can you just
[1291.64 - 1296.48] describe for us what was going on in the
[1293.52 - 1298.08] community at the time after she did this
[1296.48 - 1299.84] I know that many people had reached out
[1298.08 - 1301.84] to me and I know that many people were
[1299.84 - 1303.24] reaching out to you too what was the
[1301.84 - 1306.52] impression that they had gotten from
[1303.24 - 1308.96] Ashley's post Ashley compared Stephanie
[1306.52 - 1310.88] to her own father who she said did
[1308.96 - 1313.60] everything his fancy doctors told him to
[1310.88 - 1315.04] do but summarized that none of them
[1313.60 - 1317.84] actually had any idea what they were
[1315.04 - 1320.20] doing she said her dad did everything
[1317.84 - 1323.48] the conventional doctors told him to do
[1320.20 - 1325.76] and he died Stephanie also followed
[1323.48 - 1327.84] conventional treatment yet Ashley
[1325.76 - 1330.60] insinuated that Stephanie followed a
[1327.84 - 1332.92] protocol designed by Anthony and died
[1330.60 - 1334.84] this isn't true Stephanie received
[1332.92 - 1337.80] conventional
[1334.84 - 1341.40] treatment as for the community it was a
[1337.80 - 1344.12] mess it became so divided the fear was
[1341.40 - 1347.36] unbelievable what Ashley did was instill
[1344.12 - 1349.24] fear in so many people it was like they
[1347.36 - 1351.84] started thinking their spinach salad or
[1349.24 - 1353.48] their spinach soup was harming them and
[1351.84 - 1356.48] they went back to a standard American
[1353.48 - 1360.36] diet or went back to eating
[1356.48 - 1363.04] McDonald's it's horrifying and it's all
[1360.36 - 1366.60] so far from the truth all based on
[1363.04 - 1368.52] complete completely false claims I've
[1366.60 - 1370.08] seen from the data that Stephanie
[1368.52 - 1373.80] received conventional cancer treatment
[1370.08 - 1376.52] for almost a year and because you unlike
[1373.80 - 1378.56] Ashley were directly involved with
[1376.52 - 1380.88] Stephanie's situation you were there in
[1378.56 - 1383.48] person you had the ability to set the
[1380.88 - 1386.00] record straight so you and another
[1383.48 - 1388.08] practitioner who was also directly
[1386.00 - 1390.12] involved sent letters out to each of
[1388.08 - 1392.72] your private communities I remember
[1390.12 - 1394.56] those letters I remember the volatile
[1392.72 - 1395.80] situation that Ashley had created with
[1394.56 - 1397.60] her
[1395.80 - 1399.52] disinformation you and the other
[1397.60 - 1402.72] practitioner handled this with a
[1399.52 - 1405.04] tremendous amount of care Grace and a
[1402.72 - 1407.04] lot of respect while protecting
[1405.04 - 1410.08] Stephanie and her private information
[1407.04 - 1411.20] after Ashley had exploited her to serve
[1410.08 - 1414.64] her own
[1411.20 - 1416.52] agenda I have your letter in front of me
[1414.64 - 1418.60] and here are some of the critical
[1416.52 - 1421.36] clarifications that you
[1418.60 - 1422.88] made Stephanie was not under Anthony's
[1421.36 - 1425.20] care for
[1422.88 - 1428.00] cancer Anthony did not provide
[1425.20 - 1431.12] supplementation or food protocols for
[1428.00 - 1433.52] her Cancer all cancer related medical
[1431.12 - 1435.44] decisions were being made by Stephanie's
[1433.52 - 1438.60] family and a few close
[1435.44 - 1441.96] friends Stephanie received chemotherapy
[1438.60 - 1445.40] and many other conventional Medical
[1441.96 - 1447.84] Treatments you also shared in here about
[1445.40 - 1450.84] how devastating it was for you to have
[1447.84 - 1452.72] lost a friend and about how unhappy you
[1450.84 - 1454.84] knew it would make Stephanie that
[1452.72 - 1456.96] Anthony was being inaccurately blamed
[1454.84 - 1460.88] for such a terrible
[1456.96 - 1464.16] tragedy you had every right to send this
[1460.88 - 1466.24] letter you had every right to make those
[1464.16 - 1470.04] clarifications and we now know those
[1466.24 - 1471.88] clarifications to be true as proven by
[1470.04 - 1473.48] the evidence that has been presented in
[1471.88 - 1476.12] these podcast
[1473.48 - 1478.84] episodes but Ashley obviously didn't
[1476.12 - 1481.00] like that so can you explain what
[1478.84 - 1484.12] happened after these letters were sent
[1481.00 - 1486.40] out yeah Ashley started attacking me on
[1484.12 - 1488.24] text on audio messages while I was
[1486.40 - 1490.76] driving in the pouring rain and then she
[1488.24 - 1491.92] took the letters we sent to a very small
[1490.76 - 1493.80] private
[1491.92 - 1496.00] Community these were not public
[1493.80 - 1499.04] communities and she made a retaliation
[1496.00 - 1500.64] post posting these letters public public
[1499.04 - 1503.28] and then calling me and the other
[1500.64 - 1503.28] practitioner
[1503.40 - 1510.40] Liars okay so let's unpack that in the
[1507.00 - 1513.44] retaliation post Ashley made she said
[1510.40 - 1517.08] this some women I know were really upset
[1513.44 - 1518.68] by my post they knew Steph personally
[1517.08 - 1520.88] though I wouldn't call them good friends
[1518.68 - 1520.88] of
[1521.16 - 1527.28] hers though we've got a false claim
[1523.60 - 1528.64] right at the beginning now I think that
[1527.28 - 1530.52] Ashley tried to discount count your
[1528.64 - 1534.48] friendship with Stephanie to make you
[1530.52 - 1537.64] appear less credible Ashley also did an
[1534.48 - 1539.68] Instagram live on April 1st of 2020 in
[1537.64 - 1541.52] which she took it even
[1539.68 - 1544.52] further
[1541.52 - 1546.44] um what about the response of other
[1544.52 - 1547.76] practitioners defending him and putting
[1546.44 - 1552.23] others
[1547.76 - 1554.24] down man that's so hard to talk about
[1552.23 - 1556.44] [Music]
[1554.24 - 1558.08] um I mean first of all they called
[1556.44 - 1560.72] themselves Stu's friends which was
[1558.08 - 1563.60] really hard because they were not her
[1560.72 - 1564.92] friends like they knew her they weren't
[1563.60 - 1567.00] friends with
[1564.92 - 1570.68] her
[1567.00 - 1572.76] um it's it was amazing to me frankly if
[1570.68 - 1576.60] I'm being totally honest it was like it
[1572.76 - 1579.80] was kind of just shocking and for them
[1576.60 - 1582.48] to see and walk through that experience
[1579.80 - 1587.00] um the only thing I keep coming back to
[1582.48 - 1587.00] is they didn't know stuff that well
[1590.28 - 1595.36] so here she went as far as to say
[1593.36 - 1597.16] publicly that you and the other
[1595.36 - 1598.92] practitioner weren't friends with
[1597.16 - 1601.56] Stephanie at
[1598.92 - 1604.92] all I know that this is false first of
[1601.56 - 1608.04] all because Ashley told me the exact
[1604.92 - 1610.08] opposite on the phone several months ago
[1608.04 - 1613.20] as a reminder to everyone I recorded
[1610.08 - 1615.52] that call and it appeared in our podcast
[1613.20 - 1617.80] episodes and previous episodes and just
[1615.52 - 1620.40] so everyone also knows and understands
[1617.80 - 1622.24] that reporting was completely legal
[1620.40 - 1626.12] Ashley has made false claims about that
[1622.24 - 1629.64] as well but here is what Ashley told me
[1626.12 - 1632.52] in that call and I said this to Kimberly
[1629.64 - 1634.32] then and I Kimberly is the only person I
[1632.52 - 1636.32] really lost my temper with because I
[1634.32 - 1638.88] felt like she was Steph's friend and she
[1636.32 - 1638.88] saw what
[1639.76 - 1646.80] happened Ashley said to me privately on
[1644.32 - 1649.24] the phone that you were Stephanie's
[1646.80 - 1652.04] friend and that you saw what
[1649.24 - 1655.00] happened why is this the opposite of
[1652.04 - 1656.88] what Ashley shared in her 2020 blog post
[1655.00 - 1660.36] because it sounds to me like she was
[1656.88 - 1664.00] trying to deceive the public in Ashley's
[1660.36 - 1664.00] live she also told this
[1664.20 - 1668.72] falsity they weren't there at the
[1666.32 - 1674.72] beginning of her journey they kind of
[1668.72 - 1674.72] came in at the very end when Anthony
[1674.84 - 1678.68] ghosted this one is even more ridiculous
[1677.68 - 1680.56] I've seen
[1678.68 - 1682.84] from all the text records that the other
[1680.56 - 1684.60] practitioner Ashley is referring to
[1682.84 - 1687.52] became friends with and started texting
[1684.60 - 1689.72] with Stephanie in June of 2016 a year
[1687.52 - 1692.20] before Stephanie's health really took a
[1689.72 - 1694.76] turn and you met Stephanie at the live
[1692.20 - 1698.08] event in 2016 and became friends with
[1694.76 - 1700.28] her at that point as well I've seen so
[1698.08 - 1702.44] much evidence of both of you having been
[1700.28 - 1705.20] there for her and offering your support
[1702.44 - 1707.36] to Stephanie early on in her illness
[1705.20 - 1708.88] Journey as we've talked about before
[1707.36 - 1711.48] Ashley loves to to say that Anthony
[1708.88 - 1714.28] ghosted Stephanie to get people riled up
[1711.48 - 1716.60] it's a tactic but it's completely false
[1714.28 - 1718.84] Stephanie's family cut off communication
[1716.60 - 1722.92] between them and told Anthony in a very
[1718.84 - 1725.60] aggressive way to stay away so Ashley
[1722.92 - 1728.72] made plenty of false claims
[1725.60 - 1731.40] here yeah so Stephanie sent me hundreds
[1728.72 - 1733.20] of voice notes many of them were a long
[1731.40 - 1736.32] voice notes that's the kind of
[1733.20 - 1738.40] relationship I had with Steph I got many
[1736.32 - 1740.60] times the daily update from her I knew
[1738.40 - 1742.00] what she did from the moment she woke up
[1740.60 - 1744.00] she would take me through her morning
[1742.00 - 1747.60] morning routine and how she spent many
[1744.00 - 1750.80] of her days her messages were personal
[1747.60 - 1753.04] like really really personal they were
[1750.80 - 1754.72] family they were about friendships she
[1753.04 - 1758.00] asked for help supporting the ones that
[1754.72 - 1760.60] she loved she always asked for advice I
[1758.00 - 1763.88] know the very intimate details of some
[1760.60 - 1767.32] of the closest family members to her she
[1763.88 - 1769.56] shared it all she offered to stay in my
[1767.32 - 1771.76] home when I was postpartum to care for
[1769.56 - 1774.72] my son and to care for me the way that
[1771.76 - 1777.36] she did for her own nephew I don't think
[1774.72 - 1780.92] you share that much and offer so much
[1777.36 - 1780.92] with someone who is not your
[1781.80 - 1788.92] friend yeah it sounds like the two of
[1784.56 - 1790.80] you were close friends to me we also
[1788.92 - 1792.96] know that Ashley's claims are false
[1790.80 - 1795.56] because we have audios that Stephanie
[1792.96 - 1798.28] had sent to a friend talking about how
[1795.56 - 1801.52] close she was with you
[1798.28 - 1805.56] and him just become good friends really
[1801.52 - 1805.56] sweet women and really great
[1806.36 - 1811.96] people and about trips she had taken
[1809.36 - 1815.12] with you tomorrow I'm actually going
[1811.96 - 1817.64] away with um Kim you know Canim really
[1815.12 - 1819.40] spare and to see Gretchen because she's
[1817.64 - 1820.68] in Pennsylvania right now I remember I
[1819.40 - 1822.48] told you about that we're just going to
[1820.68 - 1824.68] go for like a couple days and spend some
[1822.48 - 1826.24] time with her and then again in a couple
[1824.68 - 1829.24] weeks I'm going to go up again for a few
[1826.24 - 1829.24] days
[1829.72 - 1835.52] we also have a text that Stephanie had
[1832.40 - 1837.12] sent to a friend about you that reads
[1835.52 - 1839.32] she lives by my brother which is
[1837.12 - 1841.96] convenient I introduced her to my
[1839.32 - 1844.72] sis-in-law and fam and they have become
[1841.96 - 1847.60] friends as well so that's been
[1844.72 - 1849.88] nice and we have a long audio from
[1847.60 - 1852.16] Stephanie talking about how you were
[1849.88 - 1854.44] there for part of her back injury which
[1852.16 - 1859.04] was months and months before Anthony was
[1854.44 - 1861.72] told by Stephanie's family to stay away
[1859.04 - 1862.76] hi well I hurt my back in the beginning
[1861.72 - 1865.36] of
[1862.76 - 1867.88] June I you know I hadn't been doing yoga
[1865.36 - 1871.44] for a while or Pilates and I ended up
[1867.88 - 1873.96] just by fluke coincidence I ended up
[1871.44 - 1876.04] doing them both in the same week and by
[1873.96 - 1876.96] the end of that week my lower back felt
[1876.04 - 1878.48] kind of
[1876.96 - 1881.16] weird
[1878.48 - 1882.92] um weird enough where literally it was
[1881.16 - 1886.56] hurting to go on the rebounder so I kind
[1882.92 - 1888.04] of had to stop that uh and then I went
[1886.56 - 1890.76] to the caropractor and everything was
[1888.04 - 1892.40] better like a day later but I only
[1890.76 - 1895.12] waited like a few days to start
[1892.40 - 1896.28] exercising again you know I started like
[1895.12 - 1898.24] light you know I just went on the
[1896.28 - 1902.12] rebounder for the first couple days and
[1898.24 - 1904.24] walked and did pocket gym but then after
[1902.12 - 1906.56] a few days I was back into yoga fully
[1904.24 - 1910.60] and I was like doing yoga every day and
[1906.56 - 1913.36] pilates every day or almost every day
[1910.60 - 1914.80] um and I was just feeling so good and I
[1913.36 - 1916.68] just like wanted to do all these things
[1914.80 - 1918.12] and it was so stupid in hindsight I'm
[1916.68 - 1921.68] like what am I thinking you know we know
[1918.12 - 1923.12] better than to do that um just too much
[1921.68 - 1924.96] at once like that especially since I
[1923.12 - 1926.72] hadn't been doing it I mean I felt fine
[1924.96 - 1928.16] doing it I felt I got right back into it
[1926.72 - 1931.68] I was doing like intense stuff and it
[1928.16 - 1934.44] was like great but clearly my body
[1931.68 - 1935.88] wasn't right ready there and so I went
[1934.44 - 1937.56] to the chiropractor again but then it
[1935.88 - 1939.12] never it got a little bit better but
[1937.56 - 1940.72] then I was carrying all these heavy
[1939.12 - 1941.92] watermelons which were killing me but
[1940.72 - 1943.60] like I was hanging out with scratching
[1941.92 - 1944.92] and Kim and like when I went up there I
[1943.60 - 1946.68] just brought all these watermelons like
[1944.92 - 1949.64] seeed huge watermelons
[1946.68 - 1951.44] and I just from there it got worse and
[1949.64 - 1953.84] worse and I was with Gretchen for like
[1951.44 - 1957.20] almost a week when I came home at the
[1953.84 - 1960.00] beginning of i as I came home the 4th of
[1957.20 - 1962.36] July it got it was like horrendous like
[1960.00 - 1965.16] it got really bad
[1962.36 - 1967.92] excruciating like super super bad like
[1965.16 - 1971.08] crazy spasming and neres like shooting
[1967.92 - 1974.84] pains like and literally I've been home
[1971.08 - 1974.84] doing nothing for the whole month of
[1976.00 - 1982.72] July all of that goes to show that you
[1980.04 - 1984.84] were around and there to see a lot of
[1982.72 - 1986.52] what happened including that Stephanie
[1984.84 - 1989.80] injured her back by doing all of the
[1986.52 - 1992.20] physical things she just described which
[1989.80 - 1994.76] again proves Ashley's original false
[1992.20 - 1998.76] story line wrong in which Ashley had
[1994.76 - 2001.32] said this on March 7th of 2020 about
[1998.76 - 2004.84] Stephanie in the spring of
[2001.32 - 2007.36] 2017 her back began to ache we talked a
[2004.84 - 2009.76] little bit during her back injury she
[2007.36 - 2012.52] told me Anthony said it was a yoga
[2009.76 - 2015.32] injury I really don't remember hurting
[2012.52 - 2018.76] it in yoga she
[2015.32 - 2020.76] said Ashley claimed that Stephanie had
[2018.76 - 2023.44] said she didn't remember hurting back in
[2020.76 - 2025.72] yoga but we have several audios from
[2023.44 - 2027.64] Stephanie like the one we just played in
[2025.72 - 2029.96] which Stephanie explains to various
[2027.64 - 2032.84] different people all about how she
[2029.96 - 2034.96] injured her back doing yoga and pilates
[2032.84 - 2037.20] so obviously Stephanie was aware and
[2034.96 - 2038.28] remembered because as we covered
[2037.20 - 2039.92] previously
[2038.28 - 2042.52] Anthony didn't tell Stephanie that her
[2039.92 - 2044.24] back problems were due to a yoga injury
[2042.52 - 2047.00] Stephanie told people that she had
[2044.24 - 2049.40] injured her back doing yoga and
[2047.00 - 2051.84] pilates and then she was doing things
[2049.40 - 2054.48] like carrying heavy watermelons with an
[2051.84 - 2057.64] already injured back that you witnessed
[2054.48 - 2059.80] which made things worse so now I just
[2057.64 - 2063.36] want to bring it back to Ashley's
[2059.80 - 2066.36] retaliation post once more again she had
[2063.36 - 2068.40] said this some women I know were really
[2066.36 - 2070.84] upset by my post
[2068.40 - 2073.92] they knew Steph personally though I
[2070.84 - 2078.24] wouldn't call them good friends of
[2073.92 - 2080.08] hers and Ashley's April 1st 2020 live in
[2078.24 - 2083.04] which she said
[2080.08 - 2085.24] this
[2083.04 - 2087.00] um I mean first of all they called
[2085.24 - 2089.52] themselves Steph's friends which was
[2087.00 - 2092.40] really hard because they were not her
[2089.52 - 2095.00] friends like they knew her they weren't
[2092.40 - 2095.00] friends with
[2096.04 - 2101.92] her we've shown the you Kim were indeed
[2099.52 - 2103.84] a good friend of Stephanie's we also
[2101.92 - 2105.76] have text and audio messages showing
[2103.84 - 2109.40] that the other practitioner Ashley was
[2105.76 - 2110.40] referring to was also in fact a good
[2109.40 - 2114.36] friend of
[2110.40 - 2116.08] Stephanie's on June 29th of 2016
[2114.36 - 2119.04] Stephanie texted the
[2116.08 - 2119.88] practitioner you're so sweet I love you
[2119.04 - 2123.44] dear
[2119.88 - 2126.56] friend in a text from November 11th of
[2123.44 - 2128.36] 2016 Stephanie says to her I love you
[2126.56 - 2132.08] dearly
[2128.36 - 2135.56] in a text from December 29th of 2016
[2132.08 - 2138.64] Stephanie said to her hey sweet friend
[2135.56 - 2140.88] in a text from July 8th of 2016
[2138.64 - 2143.96] Stephanie said to her it's also
[2140.88 - 2146.80] validating when sharing with a trusted
[2143.96 - 2148.72] friend and we have audios from Stephanie
[2146.80 - 2151.00] discussing how much this practitioner
[2148.72 - 2153.40] had helped Stephanie Stephanie's
[2151.00 - 2155.32] sister-in-law and Stephanie's brother
[2153.40 - 2157.80] who is now a plotter trying to take down
[2155.32 - 2161.00] the medical medium Community during an
[2157.80 - 2163.24] extremely troubling time for them Tony
[2161.00 - 2164.72] and Megan my brother's Tony his wife
[2163.24 - 2167.00] Megan they wanted me to be there for the
[2164.72 - 2170.32] birth I'm here supporting them you know
[2167.00 - 2171.84] they um it's just been kind of intense
[2170.32 - 2174.68] there's a lot of stuff that was going on
[2171.84 - 2177.24] to the hospital thank God man us was
[2174.68 - 2179.24] with us the entire time like you know
[2177.24 - 2181.04] over the phone and and she was always
[2179.24 - 2183.16] just so supportive and there for me the
[2181.04 - 2186.96] whole time and anything we needed and
[2183.16 - 2186.96] supporting tuny and Megan
[2188.20 - 2193.72] there are hundreds and hundreds of text
[2191.44 - 2195.56] messages that I've read going back and
[2193.72 - 2198.00] forth between Stephanie and this
[2195.56 - 2200.40] practitioner mostly of Stephanie asking
[2198.00 - 2202.32] the practitioner for advice the
[2200.40 - 2204.56] practitioner also helped Stephanie's
[2202.32 - 2207.44] family in a very significant way during
[2204.56 - 2209.96] a very dark time for them Stephanie
[2207.44 - 2211.60] regularly expressed tremendous gratitude
[2209.96 - 2214.08] for the positive impact this
[2211.60 - 2215.64] practitioner had in her life and in
[2214.08 - 2218.12] her's
[2215.64 - 2219.60] lives we've got all of this evidence of
[2218.12 - 2221.96] Stephanie calling this practitioner a
[2219.60 - 2223.88] dear friend referring to you Kim
[2221.96 - 2225.24] specifically as a good friend and
[2223.88 - 2227.60] talking about all the time that you had
[2225.24 - 2230.68] spent together including during the time
[2227.60 - 2232.72] of Stephanie's back injury clearly this
[2230.68 - 2235.16] practitioner and you were both very
[2232.72 - 2238.88] important people in Stephanie's life and
[2235.16 - 2241.68] Ashley told another big falsity to the
[2238.88 - 2243.92] public I was even invited to Stephanie's
[2241.68 - 2246.04] celebration of life I was around when
[2243.92 - 2248.88] Stephanie injured her back I remember
[2246.04 - 2251.80] her jumping on that trampoline with her
[2248.88 - 2253.64] injury I supported Stephanie and met up
[2251.80 - 2256.64] with her at the hospital the night that
[2253.64 - 2259.36] her niece was born it's a strange thing
[2256.64 - 2261.92] strange thing to have to qualify a
[2259.36 - 2264.52] friendship but what Ashley said was so
[2261.92 - 2267.32] hurtful because Stephanie was someone
[2264.52 - 2267.32] that I really cared
[2267.56 - 2274.64] about yeah I'm sure it was really
[2271.12 - 2277.24] hurtful and it's a very it's a very um
[2274.64 - 2281.40] it's a low blow it was very low for her
[2277.24 - 2283.88] to go there and so following the false
[2281.40 - 2286.76] friendship claims Ashley's retaliation
[2283.88 - 2288.96] post continued on to say this these two
[2286.76 - 2291.64] women sent out letters about my post to
[2288.96 - 2294.16] their entire communities they
[2291.64 - 2297.00] essentially made it seem like I was
[2294.16 - 2299.64] lying this was a really impactful
[2297.00 - 2302.72] experience for me because something I've
[2299.64 - 2305.44] never realized before is just how much
[2302.72 - 2308.08] you can use facts and distort them to
[2305.44 - 2313.20] create what's actually a lie
[2308.08 - 2313.20] and there's nothing I hate more than
[2313.60 - 2318.60] lying so Ashley is saying that what you
[2317.00 - 2320.84] shared was
[2318.60 - 2324.44] factual but she's still calling you a
[2320.84 - 2327.36] liar and the irony of all is that she's
[2324.44 - 2330.88] calling you a liar in a post that she
[2327.36 - 2333.56] Ashley herself told more than 15 false
[2330.88 - 2337.84] claims in one version of and more than
[2333.56 - 2339.80] 20 in another version of Kim how
[2337.84 - 2342.52] frustrating was it for you to watch
[2339.80 - 2346.00] Ashley do this
[2342.52 - 2348.76] publicly it has been so heartbreaking
[2346.00 - 2351.28] it's been extremely traumatizing for me
[2348.76 - 2352.96] for my family the amount of stress that
[2351.28 - 2355.96] Ashley has created with her false
[2352.96 - 2355.96] stories is just
[2356.08 - 2362.28] unbelievable
[2357.72 - 2363.76] yeah and sadly she didn't stop there
[2362.28 - 2366.16] Ashley tried calling you while you were
[2363.76 - 2368.16] driving in the pouring rain and because
[2366.16 - 2370.92] you didn't answer Ashley sent you a
[2368.16 - 2372.28] barrage of textt messages and I want to
[2370.92 - 2374.84] walk us through that
[2372.28 - 2376.84] conversation in the very first text
[2374.84 - 2378.96] Ashley tries to rewrite history by
[2376.84 - 2381.20] retelling her false version of what had
[2378.96 - 2383.44] happened with Stephanie she tried to
[2381.20 - 2385.60] sell this narrative to you Kim when you
[2383.44 - 2387.92] were actually there for Stephanie and
[2385.60 - 2391.68] witnessing things that had happened
[2387.92 - 2396.72] firsthand in person and Ashley was
[2391.68 - 2400.32] not the text says this hey girl I just
[2396.72 - 2402.64] can't not not say something to you Steph
[2400.32 - 2405.72] was personally Guided by Anthony for
[2402.64 - 2408.76] years she did every single thing he ever
[2405.72 - 2411.20] told her to do she laid on her back for
[2408.76 - 2413.80] months while her spine literally
[2411.20 - 2416.08] crumbled because he told her she had a
[2413.80 - 2419.20] yoga injury that later he ended up
[2416.08 - 2421.36] staying with shingles and then when she
[2419.20 - 2424.88] started bleeding from her nipples after
[2421.36 - 2428.72] telling her she would never have cancer
[2424.88 - 2431.60] his response to cut her off completely
[2428.72 - 2434.12] and never speak to her again after days
[2431.60 - 2437.64] before Steph died she was texting
[2434.12 - 2439.64] Anthony begging him just to talk to her
[2437.64 - 2442.36] for you to write that letter and
[2439.64 - 2445.12] knowingly mislead people about their
[2442.36 - 2449.28] relationship is so absolutely disgusting
[2445.12 - 2453.04] to me and just frankly
[2449.28 - 2456.84] unimaginable this text has six false
[2453.04 - 2460.24] things in it six critical things that
[2456.84 - 2462.32] are completely wrong and it seems as
[2460.24 - 2463.68] though Ashley thinks if she just repeats
[2462.32 - 2466.28] them enough she'll be able to get
[2463.68 - 2468.68] everyone to just go along with it I'm
[2466.28 - 2471.40] going to walk us through the false
[2468.68 - 2473.88] Claims One Stephanie did not do
[2471.40 - 2475.84] everything Anthony ever told her to do
[2473.88 - 2477.44] Anthony's consistent message from the
[2475.84 - 2479.68] beginning was that Stephanie should see
[2477.44 - 2481.48] a doctor for her breast lump and
[2479.68 - 2483.32] Stephanie made the decision to wait too
[2481.48 - 2486.20] long to follow that
[2483.32 - 2488.32] advice two Stephanie did not lay on her
[2486.20 - 2489.44] back for months because Anthony told her
[2488.32 - 2492.36] she had an
[2489.44 - 2494.40] injury three Stephanie got stuck laying
[2492.36 - 2496.68] on her back because Stephanie said
[2494.40 - 2500.28] herself she had injured her back doing
[2496.68 - 2502.88] yoga and pilates and it was made worse
[2500.28 - 2505.28] by Stephanie carrying heavy watermelons
[2502.88 - 2508.00] and jumping on the trampoline which you
[2505.28 - 2509.96] were actually around to see Stephanie
[2508.00 - 2513.16] got stuck laying on her back because her
[2509.96 - 2515.08] doctor diagnosed her with a disc injury
[2513.16 - 2517.20] and because she was on a small old
[2515.08 - 2519.36] childhood mattress on the floor that was
[2517.20 - 2522.08] terrible for her back and made it too
[2519.36 - 2524.04] difficult for her to get up four
[2522.08 - 2527.72] Stephanie did not bleed from both
[2524.04 - 2530.96] nipples she only bled from one and five
[2527.72 - 2532.56] Anthony never ever told Stephanie that
[2530.96 - 2536.44] she would never have
[2532.56 - 2539.12] cancer and six Anthony did not cut
[2536.44 - 2540.88] Stephanie off Stephanie's family told
[2539.12 - 2544.04] Anthony to stay
[2540.88 - 2545.68] away Stephanie did not text Anthony
[2544.04 - 2549.12] begging him to talk to
[2545.68 - 2551.48] her Ashley was so wrong about all of it
[2549.12 - 2554.24] from the beginning and yet she continued
[2551.48 - 2556.60] to berate you Kim for the factual letter
[2554.24 - 2559.24] you had sent out to your small private
[2556.60 - 2562.44] Community further text messages in this
[2559.24 - 2565.60] thread from Ashley to you said this she
[2562.44 - 2568.76] found a lump in her breast three years
[2565.60 - 2571.80] before she died and he told her it would
[2568.76 - 2575.56] never be cancerous does that bother you
[2571.80 - 2578.20] at all does it like hello is this hting
[2575.56 - 2582.60] home I get that you weren't there when
[2578.20 - 2587.24] that happened but I was does that I mean
[2582.60 - 2590.24] come on that series of texts from Ashley
[2587.24 - 2594.08] is not only incredibly condescending but
[2590.24 - 2597.04] also has three more false things in it
[2594.08 - 2598.84] the first one Stephanie did not discover
[2597.04 - 2600.24] her breast lump when she was living with
[2598.84 - 2603.00] Ashley in
[2600.24 - 2605.88] 2016 Stephanie in fact discovered the
[2603.00 - 2608.96] lump a year later when Ashley was not
[2605.88 - 2611.16] around the second false thing Anthony
[2608.96 - 2613.80] never told Stephanie that the lump would
[2611.16 - 2616.44] never become cancerous he repeatedly
[2613.80 - 2619.08] encouraged her to get it looked at by a
[2616.44 - 2621.68] physician and here Ashley's putting you
[2619.08 - 2624.52] down by claiming that she was around
[2621.68 - 2627.48] when you were not which is the exact
[2624.52 - 2630.52] opposite of the truth that's the third
[2627.48 - 2633.08] falsehood our data shows that Ashley
[2630.52 - 2634.80] wasn't around for any single part of
[2633.08 - 2638.52] Stephanie's experience with her breast
[2634.80 - 2642.64] lump her back injury her her cancer or
[2638.52 - 2644.72] her passing and yet you were physically
[2642.64 - 2646.72] there helping Stephanie as much as you
[2644.72 - 2647.76] could after just having a baby during
[2646.72 - 2650.76] Stephanie's
[2647.76 - 2653.72] illness you responded to Ashley by
[2650.76 - 2655.08] saying in all caps I'm driving in the
[2653.72 - 2657.36] pouring
[2655.08 - 2659.80] rain which sounds to me like you were
[2657.36 - 2661.96] begging her to stop attacking you and
[2659.80 - 2664.60] then Ashley replied to you by saying
[2661.96 - 2667.92] this I'm not there to see it so maybe
[2664.60 - 2670.48] it's not actually happening
[2667.92 - 2670.48] later
[2671.96 - 2679.20] cim and then she sends three IR roll
[2676.48 - 2681.96] emojis what Ashley is again
[2679.20 - 2683.96] condescendingly implying to you is that
[2681.96 - 2685.44] you don't believe in Ashley's story
[2683.96 - 2687.64] which we know is
[2685.44 - 2689.36] false she's saying it's because you
[2687.64 - 2691.80] weren't there to see it and that's why
[2689.36 - 2694.96] you don't believe her Ashley is saying
[2691.80 - 2698.56] that Ashley was there to see it and you
[2694.96 - 2701.32] weren't but in reality it's the exact
[2698.56 - 2705.80] opposite the real truth is that you were
[2701.32 - 2706.68] there and Ashley wasn't the truth you
[2705.80 - 2711.00] were
[2706.68 - 2712.64] there Ashley wasn't if Ashley wants to
[2711.00 - 2714.56] play the comparison game and use
[2712.64 - 2716.08] physical proximity as a measure of
[2714.56 - 2719.56] someone's authority to speak on
[2716.08 - 2721.68] Stephanie then in reality based on facts
[2719.56 - 2724.80] Ashley loses at her own
[2721.68 - 2727.92] game however Ashley ends up going on to
[2724.80 - 2730.32] say this to you I know that you can see
[2727.92 - 2733.68] what you did I know
[2730.32 - 2737.24] it I don't know how you can live with it
[2733.68 - 2740.92] but I know you can see it and I hope it
[2737.24 - 2740.92] haunts you bye
[2741.00 - 2747.72] Kim and then you replied by saying no
[2745.12 - 2750.00] Ash we all tried to help with all we had
[2747.72 - 2752.24] when it was going on I know you don't
[2750.00 - 2754.00] realize that but it's the truth I was
[2752.24 - 2755.88] barely paying my own bills and was
[2754.00 - 2757.44] buying her supplements at one point and
[2755.88 - 2760.24] doing everything I could with a brand
[2757.44 - 2761.84] new baby nobody saw that make me a
[2760.24 - 2764.44] monster
[2761.84 - 2766.80] though and then Ashley sent you some
[2764.44 - 2770.00] voice messages that we're going to play
[2766.80 - 2771.92] now Kim I don't think that you're a
[2770.00 - 2775.24] monster I think that what you did in
[2771.92 - 2778.92] your letter is you isolated facts and
[2775.24 - 2781.64] you painted an untrue picture of what
[2778.92 - 2785.16] happened it's just not
[2781.64 - 2788.04] true for you to use the facts that you
[2785.16 - 2791.96] do have and manipulate them in such a
[2788.04 - 2794.68] way I just I mean come
[2791.96 - 2796.72] on and honestly I don't even care about
[2794.68 - 2800.32] all the people that it impacted because
[2796.72 - 2800.32] they will have their chance to hear the
[2800.52 - 2805.80] truth I can't even call it lying because
[2803.16 - 2809.60] of the way that you used facts but you
[2805.80 - 2813.48] used them so articulately to distort the
[2809.60 - 2818.04] truth that it ended up being a lie and I
[2813.48 - 2818.04] hate that I can't stand liars
[2822.52 - 2829.04] wow wow just unreal
[2827.12 - 2832.48] Wow first of
[2829.04 - 2835.04] all I want to oh
[2832.48 - 2836.60] sorry it still gives me Goose Goosebumps
[2835.04 - 2841.80] hearing that
[2836.60 - 2844.00] yeah yeah yeah yeah I can imagine it's
[2841.80 - 2846.48] she first of all I want to point out
[2844.00 - 2849.36] that Ashley said here that she doesn't
[2846.48 - 2851.40] care about all the people who her post
[2849.36 - 2854.00] impacted because she's saying that they
[2851.40 - 2856.60] will have their chance to hear the truth
[2854.00 - 2859.40] in fact the people Ashley impacted with
[2856.60 - 2862.52] her false 2020 posts didn't get a chance
[2859.40 - 2863.80] to hear the truth before these podcasts
[2862.52 - 2866.88] if they're even still around and
[2863.80 - 2870.20] listening Ashley has impacted many
[2866.88 - 2872.84] people and hurt many people with her
[2870.20 - 2874.28] disinformation secondly Ashley's being
[2872.84 - 2877.16] incredibly manipulative in these
[2874.28 - 2879.68] messages she's twisted everything around
[2877.16 - 2881.80] so much it's actually scary she's
[2879.68 - 2884.08] attacking you relentlessly while you're
[2881.80 - 2886.44] driving in the pouring rain her
[2884.08 - 2889.00] information is all wrong she wasn't
[2886.44 - 2891.56] actually there and you were yet she's
[2889.00 - 2893.24] putting you down demeaning you and
[2891.56 - 2895.52] admitting that you used facts so she
[2893.24 - 2897.52] can't actually call it lying but at the
[2895.52 - 2899.08] same time she's calling you a liar with
[2897.52 - 2899.92] all those falsities in her text at the
[2899.08 - 2903.72] same
[2899.92 - 2906.40] time how did it feel to have a grown
[2903.72 - 2908.08] woman act like this and treat you like
[2906.40 - 2910.72] this
[2908.08 - 2913.12] honestly Amber I have PTSD from what
[2910.72 - 2914.84] Ashley did to me that night I was
[2913.12 - 2917.48] driving to my sister-in-law's wedding
[2914.84 - 2921.52] festivities I was alone it was dark it
[2917.48 - 2924.16] was pouring down rain Ashley would not
[2921.52 - 2926.44] stop she wouldn't stop I had to call my
[2924.16 - 2929.60] husband on the phone because I was
[2926.44 - 2932.00] shaking at the time I was doing my best
[2929.60 - 2934.44] to protect Stephanie's privacy and to
[2932.00 - 2939.12] not let her be exploited by Ashley it's
[2934.44 - 2941.24] really sad that Ashley has it this far
[2939.12 - 2943.32] I've now been attacked personally
[2941.24 - 2946.08] professionally my family has been
[2943.32 - 2948.88] attacked Ashley is actually the most
[2946.08 - 2952.88] intimidating person I've ever
[2948.88 - 2955.28] met yeah I'm so sorry Kim that you've
[2952.88 - 2958.04] had to go through all that and it's
[2955.28 - 2961.32] really not okay that she's that she
[2958.04 - 2963.56] attacked you like this and it's really
[2961.32 - 2965.16] Brave of you to come on here and talk
[2963.56 - 2966.92] about it because I'm sure that
[2965.16 - 2970.36] everything we're discussing you know
[2966.92 - 2973.88] brings up a lot of emotion and what's
[2970.36 - 2976.36] even worse is that Ashley didn't stop
[2973.88 - 2978.32] there that exchange that we just went
[2976.36 - 2982.20] through was in
[2978.32 - 2984.88] 2020 now 3 years later several months
[2982.20 - 2986.40] ago after I caught Ashley and the other
[2984.88 - 2988.16] plotters for what they were trying to do
[2986.40 - 2990.28] to Anthony and the medical medium
[2988.16 - 2992.84] community and we exposed them in our
[2990.28 - 2996.04] podcast episodes Ashley went on a
[2992.84 - 2997.80] rampage on social media rather than
[2996.04 - 3000.40] addressing any of her false claims we
[2997.80 - 3003.44] had corrected her on with evidence she
[3000.40 - 3006.04] pivoted onto other points of focus she
[3003.44 - 3007.84] began bullying and making fun of Anthony
[3006.04 - 3010.28] she made fun of the light blast and the
[3007.84 - 3012.36] collecting Stones meditation she made
[3010.28 - 3015.52] fun of the medical medium Community many
[3012.36 - 3018.84] of its members one of her targets was
[3015.52 - 3023.56] you and shockingly your
[3018.84 - 3026.08] kids on August 17th Ashley posted this
[3023.56 - 3027.40] this is not enough fuel for a child to
[3026.08 - 3030.20] thrive
[3027.40 - 3033.16] if you watch closely you will see that
[3030.20 - 3036.08] the children of influencers who promote
[3033.16 - 3040.64] extremely restricted diets are often
[3036.08 - 3040.64] incredibly small just like Kim's
[3042.96 - 3050.08] kids in this she tagged you along with a
[3047.20 - 3052.40] screenshot of a photo of your three kids
[3050.08 - 3054.20] plates that you had posted that You'
[3052.40 - 3056.64] captioned Beach
[3054.20 - 3059.36] snacks the plates all have a lot of
[3056.64 - 3061.44] avocado a bunch of cucumber sticks a
[3059.36 - 3063.72] bunch of strawberries and a pile of
[3061.44 - 3066.28] cooked cassaba flour tortilla
[3063.72 - 3069.28] chips Ashley continues on in the next
[3066.28 - 3071.92] story post switching back to the priate
[3069.28 - 3074.16] convo for a second many of you are
[3071.92 - 3077.32] sharing more accounts of raw vegan
[3074.16 - 3079.36] children and it's really sad a few of
[3077.32 - 3083.12] you have made the point that some kids
[3079.36 - 3086.92] are just small and that's true some kids
[3083.12 - 3090.40] are just small but all ra vegan kids are
[3086.92 - 3093.36] noticeably small in a significant way
[3090.40 - 3095.88] I've never seen a single example
[3093.36 - 3098.44] otherwise bu would welcome being
[3095.88 - 3102.64] challenged on that
[3098.44 - 3104.20] point and then just a little bit later
[3102.64 - 3106.88] after Ashley must have gotten some
[3104.20 - 3109.96] serious push back on this she deleted
[3106.88 - 3112.36] the first story and then posted this one
[3109.96 - 3115.24] I did remove that repost of the lunch
[3112.36 - 3118.12] trays though because it didn't sit right
[3115.24 - 3122.40] with me I don't want to tear down moms
[3118.12 - 3124.68] on here however I still think it is sad
[3122.40 - 3129.68] and abusive to raise your kids on a
[3124.68 - 3129.68] severely restricted diet how about
[3130.88 - 3138.08] y'all when I first read this I was sick
[3134.40 - 3141.48] to my stomach this is truly despicable
[3138.08 - 3143.04] behavior from Ashley and I would ask any
[3141.48 - 3145.60] mom out there how would you feel if
[3143.04 - 3147.72] somebody did this to you and your kids
[3145.60 - 3150.08] everyone is entitled of course to their
[3147.72 - 3152.60] own dietary belief system but it is
[3150.08 - 3154.88] unacceptable to shame and attack moms
[3152.60 - 3156.16] publicly for how you think they feed
[3154.88 - 3159.76] their kids like
[3156.16 - 3161.00] this next I have to walk us through and
[3159.76 - 3163.36] point out the falsehoods and
[3161.00 - 3166.28] inconsistencies here because it's
[3163.36 - 3169.24] insane Ashley attacked yuk Kim for
[3166.28 - 3171.12] supposedly Mal nourishing your children
[3169.24 - 3173.96] referring to a photo of your kids plates
[3171.12 - 3176.80] as lunch trays when in the exact
[3173.96 - 3180.12] screenshot Ashley used from you you
[3176.80 - 3182.48] literally captioned it Beach snacks and
[3180.12 - 3186.28] she has that in the photo that she
[3182.48 - 3188.20] reposted how much sense does it make to
[3186.28 - 3191.24] judge what somebody feeds their kids as
[3188.20 - 3193.96] a snack as if it were a meal first of
[3191.24 - 3196.08] all and then the snack plates in the
[3193.96 - 3198.32] photo have plenty of food on them there
[3196.08 - 3199.92] are piles of cooked cassava flow chips
[3198.32 - 3202.00] with guacamole there are plenty of
[3199.92 - 3205.64] strawberries and cucumber sticks as I
[3202.00 - 3208.24] said they were Beach snacks they weren't
[3205.64 - 3209.80] intended to be a Thanksgiving dinner
[3208.24 - 3213.80] they were
[3209.80 - 3216.84] snacks once again Ashley got it
[3213.80 - 3218.92] wrong all of your posts online show your
[3216.84 - 3220.72] fridge being loaded with huge amounts of
[3218.92 - 3222.96] food and your kids eating plenty of food
[3220.72 - 3225.00] with tons of variety your kids are
[3222.96 - 3226.52] obviously far from restricted and it's
[3225.00 - 3228.20] clear that Ashley was just trying to
[3226.52 - 3231.00] hurt you and I'm
[3228.20 - 3233.32] sorry thank you yeah she definitely got
[3231.00 - 3236.76] me with that one um it first made me
[3233.32 - 3239.24] really mad I cried a lot and then I
[3236.76 - 3242.92] actually started to laugh because it's
[3239.24 - 3245.28] just so insane we were traveling when I
[3242.92 - 3248.28] posted those trays it was my husband's
[3245.28 - 3250.88] 40th birthday those trays don't belong
[3248.28 - 3254.84] to me but I can tell you they were giant
[3250.88 - 3257.72] man-sized trays my baby was one at the
[3254.84 - 3261.40] time my daughter in preschool and my son
[3257.72 - 3263.76] is eight they're little young children
[3261.40 - 3265.36] you are correct Amber these were snacks
[3263.76 - 3269.28] to take to the
[3265.36 - 3271.28] beach as for the insults about my kids I
[3269.28 - 3273.36] was so sick years ago before medical
[3271.28 - 3275.96] medium and these kids were raised with
[3273.36 - 3278.72] the principles that healed my body none
[3275.96 - 3281.16] of them have ever had a cavity they
[3278.72 - 3283.92] rarely catch colds and flu and when they
[3281.16 - 3286.40] get something they bounce right back I
[3283.92 - 3288.72] attribute that to the way that we live
[3286.40 - 3290.16] and I would never call that restrictive
[3288.72 - 3292.76] illness is
[3290.16 - 3294.32] restrictive Wellness is freedom and I
[3292.76 - 3296.84] know so many of you would agree with
[3294.32 - 3301.20] that
[3296.84 - 3303.96] yes yes really well said and I also want
[3301.20 - 3306.08] to point out how Ashley conflates
[3303.96 - 3309.24] medical medium information with raw
[3306.08 - 3311.20] veganism yet again I know that your kids
[3309.24 - 3313.64] are not raw
[3311.20 - 3316.28] vegan yeah Amber my kids are not raw
[3313.64 - 3318.12] vegan they never have been I have no
[3316.28 - 3321.20] idea why Ashley would put me in that
[3318.12 - 3322.84] category there's nothing wrong with raw
[3321.20 - 3326.84] vegans but my kids are not and they
[3322.84 - 3330.76] never have been my son has consumed
[3326.84 - 3332.16] cooked soup that Ashley herself made
[3330.76 - 3334.72] while I was staying with
[3332.16 - 3336.92] her um that was when we went to visit
[3334.72 - 3339.08] her family's home in Pepple Beach my son
[3336.92 - 3341.64] was also one of the first ones to trial
[3339.08 - 3344.08] her cooked bread recipe and some of the
[3341.64 - 3347.24] cooked potato recipe in Ashley's ebooks
[3344.08 - 3349.12] that I always supported one scroll back
[3347.24 - 3351.48] will let all of you see that my kids eat
[3349.12 - 3354.12] loads of produce yes they do and they
[3351.48 - 3356.48] enjoy it but they also consumed cooked
[3354.12 - 3360.44] foods and they eat plenty of treats
[3356.48 - 3362.52] they're kids you guys once again Ashley
[3360.44 - 3366.60] got it
[3362.52 - 3367.88] wrong yeah once again very wrong it's so
[3366.60 - 3370.92] upsetting
[3367.88 - 3374.04] and I'm sure I'm sure it's so upsetting
[3370.92 - 3379.48] I can't imagine having my kids attacked
[3374.04 - 3382.96] like that um it's so Ashley has actually
[3379.48 - 3383.92] seen your kids eat cooked food that she
[3382.96 - 3387.00] made
[3383.92 - 3390.12] herself and she still called them raw
[3387.00 - 3392.88] vegan it's it's mind-blowing correct and
[3390.12 - 3394.96] correct what what's so insane and what
[3392.88 - 3397.28] also speaks to how carelessly Ashley
[3394.96 - 3399.16] just hurdles out attacks with paying
[3397.28 - 3402.96] such little attention to facts and
[3399.16 - 3405.40] details is that in the exact screenshot
[3402.96 - 3409.24] Ashley took from you and displayed in
[3405.40 - 3411.88] her post it clearly shows cooked chips
[3409.24 - 3414.84] on all of your kids plates you even
[3411.88 - 3417.52] tagged the brand of the cooked chips you
[3414.84 - 3419.52] gave your kids as a snack with guacamole
[3417.52 - 3422.12] anybody could figure out that they are
[3419.52 - 3425.24] cooked chips and obviously if you're
[3422.12 - 3427.88] feeding your kids cooked chips they're
[3425.24 - 3429.72] not raw vegan and what Ashley's saying
[3427.88 - 3433.24] doesn't make any
[3429.72 - 3435.40] sense Ashley got all of these things so
[3433.24 - 3437.24] wrong anybody who's viewing these
[3435.40 - 3440.88] stories can catch the inconsistencies
[3437.24 - 3443.52] for themselves but this is how Ashley is
[3440.88 - 3446.48] sloppy Ashley never has the details
[3443.52 - 3449.32] right makes mistakes constantly and
[3446.48 - 3452.36] leaves a trail of falsities
[3449.32 - 3454.96] everywhere and then in this series of
[3452.36 - 3458.24] attacks on your kids Ashley had the
[3454.96 - 3462.88] audacity to call your children
[3458.24 - 3465.12] small Kim your kids are objectively some
[3462.88 - 3468.56] of the healthiest and strongest looking
[3465.12 - 3470.80] kids that I've ever seen it's ridiculous
[3468.56 - 3470.80] thank
[3471.24 - 3476.56] you I'm super blessed in that department
[3474.52 - 3478.16] and if you followed along with my
[3476.56 - 3480.00] journey you've likely seen the pictures
[3478.16 - 3482.56] of my son that I've shared over the past
[3480.00 - 3484.08] year I'm pretty proud of him he's a head
[3482.56 - 3487.08] taller than most of the kids in this
[3484.08 - 3489.08] grade he's 90th percentile for height
[3487.08 - 3491.00] he's a travel and All-Star baseball
[3489.08 - 3494.20] player in fact he was on three baseball
[3491.00 - 3496.08] teams this year he's strong he's fast
[3494.20 - 3498.96] he's unbelievable and I know that sounds
[3496.08 - 3500.92] ridiculous because he's my son but I
[3498.96 - 3502.24] have every right to be proud after I
[3500.92 - 3503.84] went through what I went through with
[3502.24 - 3505.48] his birth and postpartum with him and
[3503.84 - 3506.72] just being so unwell years ago before
[3505.48 - 3510.04] finding Anthony
[3506.72 - 3512.84] he's not small at all it's quite the
[3510.04 - 3514.12] opposite my middle daughter and there's
[3512.84 - 3516.00] been a lot of commenting about her in
[3514.12 - 3518.00] the community because I've shared her
[3516.00 - 3520.52] too she's a gymnast she's an All-Star
[3518.00 - 3523.16] cheerleader who has literally abs of
[3520.52 - 3525.40] steel um if you've seen videos of her
[3523.16 - 3528.04] you've likely seen a lot of you have
[3525.40 - 3529.88] commented she's literally jacked the
[3528.04 - 3531.64] girl has muscles that I didn't have when
[3529.88 - 3533.72] I was training during some of the most
[3531.64 - 3538.28] intense training periods of my life
[3533.72 - 3540.36] she's muscle and my baby who is now two
[3538.28 - 3543.96] is literally a tub she's got a couple
[3540.36 - 3546.96] chin rolls um so while this does make me
[3543.96 - 3549.32] angry and you know she did attack my
[3546.96 - 3552.40] children I really think that one simple
[3549.32 - 3555.24] photo tells it all it's time for me to
[3552.40 - 3558.00] speak out because actually Ashley is a
[3555.24 - 3561.72] bully she bullied my children who does
[3558.00 - 3563.28] that really who does that these are lies
[3561.72 - 3565.44] she has no business commenting on my
[3563.28 - 3566.68] children she has no idea how big or
[3565.44 - 3568.60] small they are
[3566.68 - 3570.84] she has no idea what they
[3568.60 - 3572.52] eat I'm still laughing at the
[3570.84 - 3574.72] accusations from the chips and guacamole
[3572.52 - 3577.84] plate that was my husband's
[3574.72 - 3580.92] 40th birthday it was a party at the
[3577.84 - 3584.40] beach this is just one example of how my
[3580.92 - 3586.76] life has been disrupted for years now
[3584.40 - 3589.72] because of Ashley her social media post
[3586.76 - 3592.48] ruined that trip for me and my husband's
[3589.72 - 3595.72] 40th birthday because they changed my
[3592.48 - 3597.60] mood completely they were hurtful and
[3595.72 - 3602.88] they brought a tremendous amount of
[3597.60 - 3606.16] stress by publicly attacking me and my
[3602.88 - 3608.80] kids yeah it's terrible and it's
[3606.16 - 3611.36] ridiculous Ashley never should have
[3608.80 - 3614.48] stooped that low she never should have
[3611.36 - 3616.84] done that then after Ashley clearly must
[3614.48 - 3618.40] have gotten called out Ashley said she
[3616.84 - 3620.92] removed that post because she doesn't
[3618.40 - 3623.04] want to tear down moms on here but she
[3620.92 - 3625.24] still left another story post up in
[3623.04 - 3628.60] which she attacked a different mom and
[3625.24 - 3630.64] her kid for their diet it's obvious that
[3628.60 - 3632.96] the whole point of these posts was to
[3630.64 - 3634.40] put down moms for how Ashley thinks they
[3632.96 - 3637.68] feed their kids in the way that their
[3634.40 - 3641.64] kids look and like you said Kim who does
[3637.68 - 3644.08] that Ashley literally used the word
[3641.64 - 3646.68] abuse and applied that you were abusing
[3644.08 - 3648.52] your kids by what you're feeding them
[3646.68 - 3649.80] when she wasn't even accurate with any
[3648.52 - 3653.20] of her
[3649.80 - 3655.32] claims there's nothing more egregious
[3653.20 - 3657.44] Ashley just didn't get away with it and
[3655.32 - 3660.64] after receiving push back that's when
[3657.44 - 3661.68] she deleted some of it your kids are not
[3660.64 - 3664.28] even raw
[3661.68 - 3667.96] vegan some of it yeah she deleted only
[3664.28 - 3671.00] some of it and left other parts up
[3667.96 - 3672.64] yeah your kids are not even raw vegan
[3671.00 - 3675.12] medical medium information is not the
[3672.64 - 3677.72] same thing as raw veganism her posts
[3675.12 - 3680.00] don't make logical sense Ashley's raw
[3677.72 - 3682.44] vegan attacks are also especially
[3680.00 - 3686.24] baffling to me considering the fact that
[3682.44 - 3690.12] many of her own best friends and co-plot
[3686.24 - 3692.60] are actually raw vegans yeah I wonder
[3690.12 - 3694.80] how Ashley's raw vegan co- plotters and
[3692.60 - 3696.52] best friends feel now about how they
[3694.80 - 3698.64] have supported Ashley and getting to
[3696.52 - 3701.04] where she is now that she uses her
[3698.64 - 3703.76] platform to viciously criticize the diet
[3701.04 - 3706.52] that they follow and promote in their
[3703.76 - 3709.76] businesses going as far as to call moms
[3706.52 - 3712.52] who feed their kids raw vegan food
[3709.76 - 3714.92] abusive plus what Ashley said in this
[3712.52 - 3718.68] Rampage is wildly contradictive to what
[3714.92 - 3721.12] Ashley has said self in the past in an
[3718.68 - 3723.96] Instagram story post that Ashley made at
[3721.12 - 3726.64] the end of 2019 to sell her own ebook
[3723.96 - 3729.68] she said this you deserve to nourish
[3726.64 - 3731.44] your body in whatever way you choose
[3729.68 - 3734.28] without fear of
[3731.44 - 3737.52] condemnation you deserve unquestioned
[3734.28 - 3740.36] authority over what your children are
[3737.52 - 3742.68] fed
[3740.36 - 3745.44] unreal wild
[3742.68 - 3746.68] contradiction this is another prime
[3745.44 - 3750.28] example
[3746.68 - 3752.88] of sloppy Ashley it's a prime example of
[3750.28 - 3756.44] someone who is always changing to fit a
[3752.88 - 3759.80] narrative that suits her agenda of the
[3756.44 - 3762.20] moment Kim this was absolutely
[3759.80 - 3765.00] reprehensible of Ashley to- do to your
[3762.20 - 3766.64] to you and your family and I'm so sorry
[3765.00 - 3768.20] that you were the target of this attack
[3766.64 - 3769.52] and that your kids were the target of
[3768.20 - 3772.84] this
[3769.52 - 3775.08] attack it's been a lot it's impacted my
[3772.84 - 3776.52] husband in a big way too it's been
[3775.08 - 3779.92] completely
[3776.52 - 3782.68] unnecessary stress and from mother to
[3779.92 - 3785.12] mother all I think about every time she
[3782.68 - 3787.76] puts these posts out there is that this
[3785.12 - 3790.36] is time and energy away from our kids
[3787.76 - 3792.04] and away from our families we're not
[3790.36 - 3795.28] getting this time
[3792.04 - 3797.40] back like I said so many trips so many
[3795.28 - 3800.12] family events so many holidays so many
[3797.40 - 3803.52] birthdays have been ruined for me
[3800.12 - 3806.08] because of unnecessary abuse from
[3803.52 - 3809.52] Ashley Kim I can't imagine being being a
[3806.08 - 3811.36] mom and then being publicly shamed for
[3809.52 - 3814.00] feeding your kids healthy
[3811.36 - 3816.64] snacks and being shamed in a way that
[3814.00 - 3820.36] confuses people into thinking that you
[3816.64 - 3823.64] must be some kind of terrible Mom that's
[3820.36 - 3827.20] abusively starving your kids it's
[3823.64 - 3829.92] uncons sadly Ashley has so many things
[3827.20 - 3832.76] wrong another exhibit on how Ashley
[3829.92 - 3834.76] makes mistakes it makes sense as to how
[3832.76 - 3836.80] Ashley got everything wrong to begin
[3834.76 - 3840.16] with with the Stephanie story when you
[3836.80 - 3842.92] look at how many things how many details
[3840.16 - 3845.00] and how many claims are twisted
[3842.92 - 3847.48] discombobulated and just straight out
[3845.00 - 3847.48] factually
[3850.52 - 3859.72] incorrect exactly exactly and now Kim I
[3856.48 - 3862.28] want to just bring us back to 2020 for a
[3859.72 - 3864.80] moment I know that Ashley was attacking
[3862.28 - 3867.36] you in a similar way in the comments of
[3864.80 - 3869.28] her retaliation post back then and
[3867.36 - 3871.32] implying that you hadn't done enough for
[3869.28 - 3873.68] Stephanie when she was sick your husband
[3871.32 - 3876.88] defended you in a comment in which he
[3873.68 - 3879.08] said this to Ashley can't sleep because
[3876.88 - 3881.20] your comment of expecting Kimberly to go
[3879.08 - 3884.24] in a hospital right after having a child
[3881.20 - 3886.52] is ridiculous postpartum mothers are
[3884.24 - 3888.36] supposed to be resting she wasn't
[3886.52 - 3890.76] resting as she was making food and other
[3888.36 - 3893.08] stuff to send to Steph on top of driving
[3890.76 - 3896.00] it to her before she was cleared to
[3893.08 - 3897.80] actually drive all of this led to the
[3896.00 - 3900.12] issues you mentioned of an enlarged
[3897.80 - 3902.88] uterus from not resting and taking care
[3900.12 - 3906.16] of herself clearly wasn't enough for you
[3902.88 - 3907.72] I guess and for the record I was the one
[3906.16 - 3909.72] that held her back and didn't want her
[3907.72 - 3911.96] to do even more than she already did and
[3909.72 - 3913.76] kept her out of the hospital which is no
[3911.96 - 3916.32] place for a new mother if it can be
[3913.76 - 3919.76] avoided so I guess I'm the bad guy here
[3916.32 - 3921.68] for trying to protect
[3919.76 - 3924.04] Kimberly all of this was playing out
[3921.68 - 3926.32] online at the same time as Ashley was
[3924.04 - 3928.08] attacking you in the written and audio
[3926.32 - 3930.40] texts we went through
[3928.08 - 3931.76] previously and then there was an email
[3930.40 - 3934.44] you'd sent to someone who was your
[3931.76 - 3936.68] friend at the time the next
[3934.44 - 3939.96] morning I have that email in front of me
[3936.68 - 3941.88] and it says thank you for the email last
[3939.96 - 3944.52] night Ashley started sending me terrible
[3941.88 - 3947.40] text messages voice messages and then
[3944.52 - 3950.00] that post I'm not sure what prompted all
[3947.40 - 3952.08] of it honestly I didn't even read it as
[3950.00 - 3954.88] I was at a family event honoring my soon
[3952.08 - 3956.60] Tobe sister-in-law my poor husband was
[3954.88 - 3958.44] defending our side of the story as she
[3956.60 - 3960.64] put my personal information right in
[3958.44 - 3963.00] that post and failed to mention that I
[3960.64 - 3964.68] had a baby who was just weeks old as we
[3963.00 - 3967.96] were still running around and trying to
[3964.68 - 3969.88] do what we could on No Sleep our lives
[3967.96 - 3971.64] are very different and I don't think Ash
[3969.88 - 3973.72] can understand a family that has to work
[3971.64 - 3976.36] for a living and care for their children
[3973.72 - 3978.32] without help and servants I'm not being
[3976.36 - 3980.08] condescending but realistic the
[3978.32 - 3982.56] statements she made about me were
[3980.08 - 3984.52] appalling I was driving things to Steph
[3982.56 - 3987.16] before I was even cleared to drive a car
[3984.52 - 3990.24] after birth these girls put that
[3987.16 - 3992.52] pressure on me my husband was so upset
[3990.24 - 3995.00] that he took on as much as he could I'm
[3992.52 - 3997.88] really really hurt by the twists and
[3995.00 - 3999.56] lies it's a different lifestyle and she
[3997.88 - 4001.60] can't wrap her head around a mother
[3999.56 - 4003.88] working and caring for two children
[4001.60 - 4006.84] without a nanny or understand that
[4003.88 - 4009.32] husbands leave and go to work all of
[4006.84 - 4012.00] this on no sleep with a newborn and a
[4009.32 - 4014.48] 2-year-old but somehow I didn't do
[4012.00 - 4016.32] enough for her I had Gretchen staying at
[4014.48 - 4019.40] my home during such a sacred time of
[4016.32 - 4021.96] having a newborn not to mention my fear
[4019.40 - 4024.84] of her being in and out of the hospital
[4021.96 - 4026.36] and around my tiny new baby I don't know
[4024.84 - 4028.96] what the answer is here but she is
[4026.36 - 4031.76] pointing a lot of fingers and there is
[4028.96 - 4034.32] no truth to so much of what she's saying
[4031.76 - 4037.60] I feel awful harsh and heavy energy from
[4034.32 - 4040.40] her she has an agenda to spread fear and
[4037.60 - 4043.00] make herself look like a hero I wish she
[4040.40 - 4046.08] would spread Steph's life and her love
[4043.00 - 4048.40] and her beautiful spirit this is just
[4046.08 - 4050.24] upsetting anyway I'm pretty exhausted
[4048.40 - 4052.16] from all of this I hope you are resting
[4050.24 - 4055.80] today as I can barely move from all the
[4052.16 - 4055.80] stress last night
[4056.08 - 4062.28] Kimberly can you share more with us Kim
[4058.64 - 4064.44] about why why it was that Ashley and
[4062.28 - 4066.84] Gretchen were putting so much pressure
[4064.44 - 4068.32] on you to help Stephanie more and more
[4066.84 - 4071.52] when you just had a baby there was so
[4068.32 - 4074.80] much going on and it was up to a 4-Hour
[4071.52 - 4077.28] drive one way for you why did Stephanie
[4074.80 - 4079.00] need so help with food poor Stephanie
[4077.28 - 4081.28] wouldn't eat the hospital food she was
[4079.00 - 4083.08] relying on friends to bring her food
[4081.28 - 4085.40] when she couldn't get enough help from
[4083.08 - 4087.96] friends or family she just wouldn't eat
[4085.40 - 4092.52] looking back I asked myself why wouldn't
[4087.96 - 4096.24] an extremely wealthy friend send food a
[4092.52 - 4098.56] chef support something instead I was
[4096.24 - 4100.60] pushed to the max I opened up my home
[4098.56 - 4103.20] postpartum to Gretchen who came to care
[4100.60 - 4105.04] for Stuff Gretchen was also met at the
[4103.20 - 4106.84] airport with a hot tea and a home-cooked
[4105.04 - 4109.72] meal that my husband and I prepared for
[4106.84 - 4112.52] her I wanted to support the situation as
[4109.72 - 4115.76] best I could at the time but nothing I'm
[4112.52 - 4119.00] telling you nothing that I did was good
[4115.76 - 4121.04] enough nothing I don't get that time
[4119.00 - 4122.92] back with my newborn I don't get to do
[4121.04 - 4125.36] it again I don't get to hold her again
[4122.92 - 4127.88] as a newborn I don't get to be there
[4125.36 - 4130.20] again with my two-year-old son I I went
[4127.88 - 4133.60] through all of this and that time is
[4130.20 - 4138.84] just it's gone it's passed and now I
[4133.60 - 4138.84] live with Ash trashing me whenever she
[4139.04 - 4147.12] chooses and continuing to disrupt your
[4142.36 - 4149.60] family time and it just seems really odd
[4147.12 - 4151.88] to me that you were the object of blame
[4149.60 - 4153.44] here and especially when you and your
[4151.88 - 4155.72] husband did as much as you could for
[4153.44 - 4158.08] Stephanie after just having a baby and
[4155.72 - 4160.12] not living that close to her it seems
[4158.08 - 4163.00] like over and over again throughout the
[4160.12 - 4167.56] whole Stephanie situation the plotters
[4163.00 - 4171.32] Ashley Robbie Taylor Christina Megan
[4167.56 - 4174.20] Tony Gretchen have tried to place blame
[4171.32 - 4176.40] on people who were actually trying to
[4174.20 - 4178.36] help yeah many of Stephanie's friends
[4176.40 - 4180.52] were just doing the best they could to
[4178.36 - 4182.36] help her when it was possible and that
[4180.52 - 4184.24] was all acceptable they were happy if
[4182.36 - 4185.92] someone donated some time or some energy
[4184.24 - 4188.68] or some food or whatever it was but
[4185.92 - 4190.56] somehow I was definitely a Target in the
[4188.68 - 4192.36] whole thing I was being pushed to do
[4190.56 - 4195.12] more and more and more and whatever I
[4192.36 - 4198.12] did it was not good enough I did what I
[4195.12 - 4201.40] could in the situation I was in with a
[4198.12 - 4203.76] brand new baby somehow the 2-year-old
[4201.40 - 4206.16] little boy and the several week old
[4203.76 - 4208.00] little girl that I had in my arms while
[4206.16 - 4209.52] my husband was away at work was
[4208.00 - 4210.96] completely overlooked they just kept
[4209.52 - 4213.20] looking at me like I was some kind of
[4210.96 - 4216.72] robot that was supposed to go and do and
[4213.20 - 4221.76] do more and more it was
[4216.72 - 4223.72] horrible wow yeah wow and in reality I
[4221.76 - 4225.88] mean you were trying so hard to help
[4223.72 - 4228.56] Stephanie in an impossible situation on
[4225.88 - 4229.92] no sleep that you actually had gasoline
[4228.56 - 4233.44] sprayed all over you to the point that
[4229.92 - 4236.12] your hair was drenched and Ashley who
[4233.44 - 4239.24] was putting all this pressure on you was
[4236.12 - 4241.28] nowhere to be found and an exposure like
[4239.24 - 4244.36] that of getting straight gasoline
[4241.28 - 4247.48] sprayed all over your head all on your
[4244.36 - 4250.20] hair all over your body it's treacherous
[4247.48 - 4252.68] that much gasoline all on your body
[4250.20 - 4254.80] soaked on you like that gets absorbed
[4252.68 - 4255.92] into your breast milk you just had a
[4254.80 - 4257.92] baby
[4255.92 - 4260.36] and then your immune system is already
[4257.92 - 4262.76] comp compromised because you had a baby
[4260.36 - 4266.48] and then you yourself Kim were sick
[4262.76 - 4268.92] years ago this is a major exposure which
[4266.48 - 4271.52] could trigger your system and then if
[4268.92 - 4274.08] you were sitting in your car right after
[4271.52 - 4277.20] you just had gasoline dumped all over
[4274.08 - 4280.92] you if you had accidentally hit the car
[4277.20 - 4282.96] lighter with your elbow or your hand or
[4280.92 - 4287.08] your phone just by putting your phone
[4282.96 - 4290.40] down you could have gone up and Flames
[4287.08 - 4292.64] all it would take is just one spark from
[4290.40 - 4295.60] an electrical wire from just the
[4292.64 - 4298.00] ignition of the car starting and you
[4295.60 - 4300.88] would have burned up and died along with
[4298.00 - 4303.20] your baby in the car all because you're
[4300.88 - 4306.60] helping out a friend Stephanie while
[4303.20 - 4308.96] Ashley was sitting in Malibu in her
[4306.60 - 4311.72] multi-million dollar house and then
[4308.96 - 4313.96] spreading rumors and false claims about
[4311.72 - 4316.08] how you and Stephanie weren't even
[4313.96 - 4317.48] friends yeah
[4316.08 - 4320.00] not
[4317.48 - 4322.80] friends it actually haunts me Anthony
[4320.00 - 4325.68] the whole situation haunts me it was
[4322.80 - 4327.76] traumatic like truly traumatic for me
[4325.68 - 4330.84] and to have to live with the constant
[4327.76 - 4333.32] social media insults threats and stress
[4330.84 - 4335.72] it just brings it all up over and over
[4333.32 - 4338.80] and over again every single time I see
[4335.72 - 4341.08] her starting posting it's like the antic
[4338.80 - 4343.44] start and I just it it all comes up over
[4341.08 - 4348.40] and over again for
[4343.44 - 4352.08] me I'm so sorry him thanks Amber
[4348.40 - 4357.72] and yeah you you
[4352.08 - 4357.72] also awful yeah it's
[4358.20 - 4364.28] aw you also ended up unfortunately with
[4361.76 - 4367.08] an enlarged uterus because you were
[4364.28 - 4369.16] standing up constantly making food
[4367.08 - 4371.32] driving long distances before you were
[4369.16 - 4374.72] cleared to and bringing food to
[4371.32 - 4378.12] Stephanie instead of resting postpartum
[4374.72 - 4379.04] and at the same time Ashley was nowhere
[4378.12 - 4382.56] to be
[4379.04 - 4384.40] found while you were going so far out of
[4382.56 - 4387.48] your way to help Stephanie that you
[4384.40 - 4390.48] risked your own life and your baby's
[4387.48 - 4392.84] life and sacrificed your body literally
[4390.48 - 4395.24] to help you did all of this because
[4392.84 - 4399.04] Stephanie was a close friend of
[4395.24 - 4402.64] yours and Ashley was nowhere to be found
[4399.04 - 4404.20] yet Ashley has the nerve and entitlement
[4402.64 - 4406.56] to imply that you weren't doing enough
[4404.20 - 4408.84] for Steph and that you weren't even a
[4406.56 - 4413.28] friend of hers at
[4408.84 - 4417.12] all Yeah Ashley always communicated as a
[4413.28 - 4419.92] very entitled manipulative woman I just
[4417.12 - 4421.56] didn't know to what extent back then
[4419.92 - 4423.72] that she was
[4421.56 - 4425.24] entitled um when we all flew out to
[4423.72 - 4427.52] Pebble Beach to stay in her family's
[4425.24 - 4430.12] home Stephanie actually didn't have the
[4427.52 - 4433.48] money to go and it was a really touchy
[4430.12 - 4436.60] subject but meanwhile Ashley the
[4433.48 - 4439.00] daughter of a billionaire family didn't
[4436.60 - 4441.88] offer support to her then I look back at
[4439.00 - 4444.08] those emails wondering why did Ashley
[4441.88 - 4446.72] not just buy her a ticket if they were
[4444.08 - 4446.72] such good
[4446.76 - 4452.60] friends yeah it's a really great
[4449.88 - 4454.96] question and I looked through those
[4452.60 - 4457.88] emails there are a few I want to read
[4454.96 - 4460.44] off for everyone the first one was from
[4457.88 - 4463.72] Stephanie to everyone on the email
[4460.44 - 4465.88] thread that Ashley had invited to a
[4463.72 - 4469.12] weekend getaway
[4465.88 - 4471.60] it was sent on January 11th of 2017 just
[4469.12 - 4475.44] a few months before Stephanie discovered
[4471.60 - 4477.68] her breast lump and it says hey I'm
[4475.44 - 4481.04] still in the unknown territory if I can
[4477.68 - 4483.28] come or not financially at the moment
[4481.04 - 4486.04] not best however things could turn
[4483.28 - 4489.04] around and make it possible very quickly
[4486.04 - 4491.00] flight prices are low so that's a plus
[4489.04 - 4493.60] so I may have to wait as it gets closer
[4491.00 - 4495.96] to make a move is that
[4493.60 - 4498.68] okay this question question was directed
[4495.96 - 4501.28] to Ashley and Stephanie said that flight
[4498.68 - 4503.40] prices are low but still too much for
[4501.28 - 4507.40] her to afford at the
[4503.40 - 4509.20] moment then on January 22nd of 2017
[4507.40 - 4511.08] Ashley sends an email to everyone in the
[4509.20 - 4513.16] group with a status update and some
[4511.08 - 4514.76] background information about each person
[4513.16 - 4518.20] for her friends who hadn't met each
[4514.76 - 4522.48] other before Ashley's update to everyone
[4518.20 - 4525.00] about Stephanie says this Stephanie
[4522.48 - 4528.64] possible step is trying to make it work
[4525.00 - 4531.52] work financially I so want her to be
[4528.64 - 4533.80] there Steph is a wealth of information
[4531.52 - 4536.80] and a bright positive Shining Light in
[4533.80 - 4538.96] any group she's part of for dinner she
[4536.80 - 4541.60] likes to eat heads of Roma lettuce
[4538.96 - 4545.68] dipped in kind pepper and lemon if
[4541.60 - 4550.28] that's not next level I don't know what
[4545.68 - 4553.16] is I was shocked by this email because
[4550.28 - 4556.08] here Ashley is actually praising
[4553.16 - 4558.24] Stephanie for eating only lettuce with
[4556.08 - 4561.92] cayenne and lemon for
[4558.24 - 4563.96] dinner as we've covered a lot obviously
[4561.92 - 4566.76] a head of lettuce as a meal let alone
[4563.96 - 4568.96] for dinner is not enough it is not
[4566.76 - 4571.08] MediCal medium information this is
[4568.96 - 4574.28] something Anthony absolutely advises
[4571.08 - 4577.88] against it was Stephanie's pre-existing
[4574.28 - 4581.08] approach to food that here we see Ashley
[4577.88 - 4582.80] praising and calling next level like
[4581.08 - 4585.68] restricting yourself is something that
[4582.80 - 4588.00] everyone should aspire to do
[4585.68 - 4591.20] and Ashley said in this email that she
[4588.00 - 4593.44] so wants Stephanie to be there Stephanie
[4591.20 - 4597.20] had said herself that flight prices were
[4593.44 - 4598.68] low at the time in 2017 flight prices
[4597.20 - 4600.44] were quite a bit cheaper than they are
[4598.68 - 4603.04] today I'm sure that she could have
[4600.44 - 4605.84] gotten a flight from Philly to La where
[4603.04 - 4610.40] Ashley suggested everyone to fly into
[4605.84 - 4613.40] from a Budget Airline for 99 to
[4610.40 - 4616.52] $150 Ashley is the daughter of a
[4613.40 - 4618.76] billionaire family and has a trust fund
[4616.52 - 4620.32] as you said if Ashley was truly such
[4618.76 - 4622.68] great friends with Stephanie and really
[4620.32 - 4625.76] wanted Stephanie there why wouldn't
[4622.68 - 4629.60] Ashley have just gotten her the plane
[4625.76 - 4631.28] ticket yeah looking back I really do not
[4629.60 - 4633.72] understand it especially with all the
[4631.28 - 4635.24] finger pointing Ashley has done Ashley
[4633.72 - 4637.16] let her miss out because Stephanie
[4635.24 - 4638.56] couldn't afford it and then Ashley even
[4637.16 - 4640.20] asked everyone in the group who was
[4638.56 - 4642.60] coming to her family's multi-million
[4640.20 - 4645.60] dollar home for a weekend for a cleaning
[4642.60 - 4645.60] fee
[4646.80 - 4653.04] I saw that in the email
[4649.08 - 4657.08] thread unbelievable a cleaning
[4653.04 - 4659.68] fee so after the Pebble Beach thing just
[4657.08 - 4662.24] a few months later Stephanie discovers
[4659.68 - 4665.84] her breast lump in March and then she
[4662.24 - 4667.96] injures her back and then she gets sick
[4665.84 - 4669.52] during the time that Stephanie was Ill
[4667.96 - 4671.64] how would you describe Ashley's
[4669.52 - 4673.60] relationship with Stephanie's family do
[4671.64 - 4676.32] you know if they interacted were they
[4673.60 - 4678.88] close what was that like Ashley actually
[4676.32 - 4681.16] talked negatively about Stephanie's
[4678.88 - 4682.80] family there was this constant thing
[4681.16 - 4685.76] where the family wanted Stephanie to
[4682.80 - 4687.84] receive conventional Cancer Care and the
[4685.76 - 4690.48] plotters were not in agreement with the
[4687.84 - 4693.80] family's wishes Stephanie's personal
[4690.48 - 4696.36] wishes were pushed completely to the
[4693.80 - 4698.36] side at the time the plotters and the
[4696.36 - 4701.80] family were not on the same page at all
[4698.36 - 4705.32] so it's so unbelievably strange to me
[4701.80 - 4708.56] that now they've come together to BL and
[4705.32 - 4710.12] attack Anthony who wasn't even involved
[4708.56 - 4712.56] in Stephanie's Cancer Care because the
[4710.12 - 4714.36] family cut off communication with him it
[4712.56 - 4716.32] was a lot for me birthing a baby and
[4714.36 - 4718.84] trying to simultaneously support a
[4716.32 - 4722.56] friend who was not well and listening to
[4718.84 - 4725.04] Stephanie stress literally stress about
[4722.56 - 4727.28] her support people closest to her not
[4725.04 - 4729.52] getting along I was dealing with the
[4727.28 - 4732.12] text threads with the plotters that were
[4729.52 - 4735.60] trashing and fighting with her family it
[4732.12 - 4737.76] was horrendous seeing those plotters who
[4735.60 - 4741.00] were disagreeing with and arguing with
[4737.76 - 4744.24] Stephanie's family now representing and
[4741.00 - 4747.12] advocating for them or with them is very
[4744.24 - 4750.20] confusing to me my own data clearly
[4747.12 - 4751.84] shows that there was a major issue
[4750.20 - 4754.76] between the plotters and Stephanie's
[4751.84 - 4756.84] family my husband witnessed this in
[4754.76 - 4759.16] person when he went into the hospital to
[4756.84 - 4762.80] visit Stephanie the plotters and the
[4759.16 - 4762.80] family were not on the same
[4763.20 - 4770.24] page that's extremely interesting and is
[4768.56 - 4772.88] something that's very it's very
[4770.24 - 4775.92] confusing to think about that as well
[4772.88 - 4779.28] and how things somehow changed and
[4775.92 - 4781.52] flipped in that way and then what
[4779.28 - 4783.52] happened when your husband went to the
[4781.52 - 4785.56] hospital to visit and bring food to
[4783.52 - 4789.36] Stephanie what what did he
[4785.56 - 4791.72] see so my husband observed an argument
[4789.36 - 4794.16] between Taylor Stephanie and Stephanie's
[4791.72 - 4795.84] family Stephanie didn't want the
[4794.16 - 4798.84] treatment at the hospital that was being
[4795.84 - 4801.56] offered at that moment she was crying
[4798.84 - 4803.68] it's heartbreaking Taylor was on her
[4801.56 - 4807.04] team and she was fighting with the
[4803.68 - 4808.92] family Stephanie wanted to go to Mexico
[4807.04 - 4812.24] for an alternative treatment but her
[4808.92 - 4813.60] family didn't agree to this my husband
[4812.24 - 4815.68] just wanted to have a genuine
[4813.60 - 4817.48] conversation with Stephanie the way that
[4815.68 - 4819.56] he had so many times in the past but it
[4817.48 - 4821.16] was uncomfortable and impossible because
[4819.56 - 4823.72] of this conflict that was going on while
[4821.16 - 4825.72] he was there instead he tried to be
[4823.72 - 4827.48] helpful and find creative ways to keep
[4825.72 - 4831.40] the food cold and be sure that juices
[4827.48 - 4833.52] were kept fresh for her but the family
[4831.40 - 4836.00] they always hated the way that she ate
[4833.52 - 4838.16] dating back years before Stephanie even
[4836.00 - 4840.80] knew Anthony the family did not like the
[4838.16 - 4842.24] way that she ate the family made my
[4840.80 - 4844.68] husband feel like he was a villain for
[4842.24 - 4846.32] bringing food to
[4844.68 - 4850.40] Stephanie
[4846.32 - 4852.52] wow so there was this massive ongoing
[4850.40 - 4856.32] battle between the plotters and the
[4852.52 - 4857.92] family completely independent of Anthony
[4856.32 - 4860.16] and just to bring this all together for
[4857.92 - 4862.60] everyone all Anthony ever did in this
[4860.16 - 4865.48] whole situation as we've shown was
[4862.60 - 4867.84] encourage Stephanie to see a doctor
[4865.48 - 4870.28] offer emotional support and try to get
[4867.84 - 4872.48] her up off the floor she got stuck on
[4870.28 - 4875.36] due to her injury so that she could get
[4872.48 - 4877.40] in for proper Medical Care Anthony was
[4875.36 - 4880.80] not Stephanie's health practitioner
[4877.40 - 4882.60] Anthony is not an oncologist in order to
[4880.80 - 4885.84] get diagnosed with cancer you need to
[4882.60 - 4888.08] see a board certified oncologist ologist
[4885.84 - 4890.20] from the moment Stephanie discovered her
[4888.08 - 4893.32] breast lump she was repeatedly told by
[4890.20 - 4895.16] Anthony to see a physician if Stephanie
[4893.32 - 4896.88] had listened to Anthony's advice to see
[4895.16 - 4899.24] a doctor from the
[4896.88 - 4901.64] beginning outcomes probably would have
[4899.24 - 4903.76] been entirely different and we probably
[4901.64 - 4907.00] wouldn't need to be sitting here today
[4903.76 - 4909.40] to talk about this and you Kim you even
[4907.00 - 4912.00] talked with Stephanie early on about
[4909.40 - 4914.36] doctors she could see in the area that
[4912.00 - 4916.44] were near her and you said earlier on
[4914.36 - 4918.16] that Stephanie wasn't receptive to that
[4916.44 - 4921.80] at the
[4918.16 - 4924.04] time and so then Stephanie's battle with
[4921.80 - 4926.80] cancer ended up going on for about a
[4924.04 - 4930.88] year after Anthony was told aggressively
[4926.80 - 4933.88] to stay away during that time again
[4930.88 - 4935.64] independent of Anthony the plotters were
[4933.88 - 4938.20] fighting for Stephanie to get some kind
[4935.64 - 4940.24] of alternative treatment for her cancer
[4938.20 - 4942.52] while the family on the other hand
[4940.24 - 4945.28] wanted her to do conventional
[4942.52 - 4948.08] treatment while Stephanie was SI sick
[4945.28 - 4951.96] the plotters and the family were at odds
[4948.08 - 4953.80] Waring with each other and then when did
[4951.96 - 4956.04] things change when did you see the
[4953.80 - 4957.76] plotter start coming around and and
[4956.04 - 4960.04] coming together with the family to try
[4957.76 - 4963.00] to blame
[4960.04 - 4964.76] Anthony I honestly didn't see things
[4963.00 - 4967.04] change until years after Stephanie
[4964.76 - 4968.56] passed away months after Stephanie
[4967.04 - 4970.88] passed away I was invited to her
[4968.56 - 4974.12] celebration of life the plotters were
[4970.88 - 4975.88] offering Retreats yeah they were
[4974.12 - 4978.80] offering retreats to the medical medium
[4975.88 - 4980.92] community and then all of a sudden the
[4978.80 - 4983.92] pters changed their tune it was
[4980.92 - 4987.72] literally overnight and to me that seems
[4983.92 - 4987.72] so clear that an agenda was
[4988.88 - 4996.80] born yeah it's pretty crazy and then I
[4994.36 - 4999.20] want to bring it back to when Stephanie
[4996.80 - 5001.20] was Ill when you went to go bring
[4999.20 - 5003.72] Stephanie food at the time that she was
[5001.20 - 5005.80] living in her family's home what was
[5003.72 - 5007.72] that experience like for you I went to
[5005.80 - 5009.84] Stephanie's family's home to pick
[5007.72 - 5012.40] Gretchen up who was going to stay in my
[5009.84 - 5014.04] home Gretchen was using my husband's car
[5012.40 - 5016.60] but on that day he had to travel for
[5014.04 - 5018.80] work so I drove to pick her up I was
[5016.60 - 5020.64] drenched And Gasoline by the time that I
[5018.80 - 5023.08] got there and needed to take a shower
[5020.64 - 5024.96] and rinse off as quickly as possible I
[5023.08 - 5027.44] showered in one of Stephanie's family's
[5024.96 - 5029.36] bathrooms it was a really scary time for
[5027.44 - 5031.08] me I had my newborn baby and I brought
[5029.36 - 5033.32] her in her little car seat because
[5031.08 - 5034.56] Stephanie wanted to meet her she
[5033.32 - 5037.48] actually wasn't able to hold the the
[5034.56 - 5039.60] baby due to the drugs that she was on I
[5037.48 - 5041.72] dropped off some food for her and was
[5039.60 - 5043.80] just in shocked from all that happened
[5041.72 - 5046.04] with the gasoline and all that was
[5043.80 - 5048.00] happening around me in that moment it
[5046.04 - 5050.00] was around the same time when I was told
[5048.00 - 5052.04] by Gretchen that she had observed
[5050.00 - 5053.96] Stephanie with dust bunnies on her head
[5052.04 - 5056.52] and face and that Gretchen had to dust
[5053.96 - 5058.44] her off when she arrived in her home my
[5056.52 - 5060.68] heart was broken and honestly it's still
[5058.44 - 5060.68] is
[5061.08 - 5068.36] Amber that is horrifying and and the
[5065.64 - 5072.08] fact that it was Gretchen who is now a
[5068.36 - 5073.72] plotter who saw the dust situation is
[5072.08 - 5076.20] especially
[5073.72 - 5078.44] interesting yeah it was horrible all of
[5076.20 - 5080.20] it the the whole situation was horrible
[5078.44 - 5082.80] it was so hard to see it was hard to
[5080.20 - 5084.32] hear it was hard to experience and all
[5082.80 - 5086.40] at the same time with everything that I
[5084.32 - 5089.28] had going on I felt so terrible for
[5086.40 - 5090.64] Stephanie and I couldn't understand why
[5089.28 - 5092.40] and everything that she was going
[5090.64 - 5095.16] through that she would be covered in
[5092.40 - 5097.20] dust
[5095.16 - 5099.24] yeah yeah that's something that's really
[5097.20 - 5100.80] hard for me to wrap my head around as
[5099.24 - 5103.92] well
[5100.80 - 5107.36] and so then it's some point when
[5103.92 - 5111.44] Stephanie was sick Taylor Who's now also
[5107.36 - 5113.44] a plotter stepped in could you explain
[5111.44 - 5116.00] what your experience was like with her
[5113.44 - 5119.12] and what role Taylor
[5116.00 - 5121.08] played so Taylor was one of the ones
[5119.12 - 5124.52] arguing at the hospital she basically
[5121.08 - 5127.24] took over but she also was not fond of
[5124.52 - 5130.16] the family and they were not F of her
[5127.24 - 5131.96] Taylor was in charge though or at least
[5130.16 - 5135.24] she thought she was in charge of the
[5131.96 - 5138.00] whole situation she was so manipulative
[5135.24 - 5140.60] and so bossy on the text messages and on
[5138.00 - 5143.08] the phone I had never even met her in
[5140.60 - 5145.24] person like have never met this woman
[5143.08 - 5147.44] ever yet she was calling me out and
[5145.24 - 5149.68] saying I needed to do more even though I
[5147.44 - 5152.24] had a newborn and I remember thinking
[5149.68 - 5153.76] that she was really insensitive and mean
[5152.24 - 5155.52] and I didn't and and she just didn't
[5153.76 - 5157.60] realize I'm like does this woman realize
[5155.52 - 5159.96] I have a newborn right now she she just
[5157.60 - 5163.08] didn't
[5159.96 - 5164.96] understand yeah that that description
[5163.08 - 5167.08] especially the bossiness matches a lot
[5164.96 - 5170.84] of the experiences that I had with
[5167.08 - 5173.16] Taylor several months ago in person um
[5170.84 - 5176.28] so so Stephanie was in a vulnerable
[5173.16 - 5178.76] position her back injury prevented her
[5176.28 - 5180.56] from being able to do much herself she
[5178.76 - 5183.32] was having a hard time getting the food
[5180.56 - 5184.84] that she needed you said earlier that
[5183.32 - 5188.36] she wasn't really making her own
[5184.84 - 5191.16] decisions Taylor who was acting you know
[5188.36 - 5193.56] as her caretaker and Stephanie's family
[5191.16 - 5195.20] were making a lot of decisions for her
[5193.56 - 5197.92] you were being supportive and trying to
[5195.20 - 5199.96] help out as best as you could did you
[5197.92 - 5202.40] and Stephanie stay in touch throughout
[5199.96 - 5205.64] the course of her illness or how did
[5202.40 - 5207.80] that go so for a long time we were in
[5205.64 - 5209.60] Daily communication personally and also
[5207.80 - 5211.12] in group chats with various different
[5209.60 - 5213.96] plotters that were discussing
[5211.12 - 5215.76] Stephanie's situation all of a sudden
[5213.96 - 5218.04] out of the blue Stephanie stopped
[5215.76 - 5219.88] responding to me I was told by Gretchen
[5218.04 - 5223.20] that her brother took her phone away and
[5219.88 - 5225.68] I never heard from her again I was also
[5223.20 - 5227.56] removed from the group chats it was very
[5225.68 - 5229.88] very weird because Stephanie normally
[5227.56 - 5232.44] would text a lot and send a lot of audio
[5229.88 - 5235.16] messages and all of that I was again
[5232.44 - 5237.00] newly postpartum so swallowing this was
[5235.16 - 5239.08] all really hard and I was just trying to
[5237.00 - 5241.40] survive and feeling completely
[5239.08 - 5246.00] heartbroken at the same
[5241.40 - 5248.64] time wow yeah so you were told by
[5246.00 - 5251.52] Gretchen that Stephanie's brother took
[5248.64 - 5251.52] Stephanie's phone
[5251.72 - 5256.84] away wow and we actually have text
[5255.20 - 5258.36] messages and audio recordings
[5256.84 - 5260.92] corroborating what you just said that
[5258.36 - 5262.80] we'll be sharing in another episode it's
[5260.92 - 5264.60] really sad that you had the same
[5262.80 - 5266.48] experience as other friends of
[5264.60 - 5269.00] Stephanie's who were either cut off
[5266.48 - 5271.48] without explanation or were told that
[5269.00 - 5274.40] they were not allowed to speak with her
[5271.48 - 5276.84] yeah and then I'm also curious about
[5274.40 - 5279.52] experience with Stephanie before she got
[5276.84 - 5281.16] sick what were Stephanie's eating habits
[5279.52 - 5283.72] like before she got
[5281.16 - 5285.96] sick so actually shocking to me as
[5283.72 - 5287.88] someone that eats a very clean diet
[5285.96 - 5290.16] which has reversed my own symptoms years
[5287.88 - 5292.68] ago I I was actually shocked when I met
[5290.16 - 5295.28] Stephanie for lunch or at a juice bar
[5292.68 - 5297.24] she wouldn't eat it was very rare that
[5295.28 - 5299.32] she would eat something she mostly
[5297.24 - 5302.36] wouldn't eat at all not even at a
[5299.32 - 5305.60] completely organic juice bar one time I
[5302.36 - 5309.00] actually had a car full of fresh organic
[5305.60 - 5310.88] produce like wholesale produce fresh and
[5309.00 - 5313.24] she wouldn't touch any of the fruit and
[5310.88 - 5315.16] she would eat only the lettuce and I
[5313.24 - 5319.72] just always felt like she was starving
[5315.16 - 5319.72] and it just it just broke my
[5320.12 - 5326.08] heart yeah so you experienced Stephanie
[5322.96 - 5328.76] having some pre-existing problems with
[5326.08 - 5332.08] food just eating lettuce is definitely
[5328.76 - 5335.08] not MediCal medium information and it's
[5332.08 - 5337.48] really sad frankly yeah and
[5335.08 - 5340.28] yeah this goes along with so much
[5337.48 - 5343.24] evidence that we have of what Stephanie
[5340.28 - 5346.40] was eating and not eating which is the
[5343.24 - 5349.56] exact opposite of the story Ashley tried
[5346.40 - 5351.52] to tell starting in 2020 about Stephanie
[5349.56 - 5352.24] following medical medium information to
[5351.52 - 5355.80] a
[5352.24 - 5358.28] te so Ashley's told many false stories
[5355.80 - 5361.12] about Stephanie and many other things
[5358.28 - 5363.48] and now you've heard all the different
[5361.12 - 5366.76] iterations of the infamous cat story we
[5363.48 - 5370.00] shared earlier on in this podcast series
[5366.76 - 5372.72] Ashley told me directly in my calls with
[5370.00 - 5376.04] her that Anthony had put her on a
[5372.72 - 5377.12] fat-free raw diet and completely missed
[5376.04 - 5380.40] the cat
[5377.12 - 5382.96] allergy however one of the true
[5380.40 - 5385.84] versions of that cat story came from a
[5382.96 - 5389.44] text conversation Ashley had with you on
[5385.84 - 5391.60] September 14th of 2018 which was months
[5389.44 - 5393.84] after she had given away their pet cat
[5391.60 - 5397.48] because in fact Anthony had said that
[5393.84 - 5400.44] the cat was part of the problem in
[5397.48 - 5402.36] Ashley's text to you Ashley said that
[5400.44 - 5405.52] Anthony told her to cut out nuts and
[5402.36 - 5408.60] seeds specifically for her son's eczema
[5405.52 - 5410.96] but that fats like olive oil were
[5408.60 - 5413.16] okay she also said to you that Anthony
[5410.96 - 5414.76] had recommended lots of squash which is
[5413.16 - 5417.80] something that would be cooked of course
[5414.76 - 5419.68] not raw so Ashley obviously was not put
[5417.80 - 5423.32] in a fat-free raw
[5419.68 - 5427.04] diet yeah this one is really crazy to
[5423.32 - 5428.92] hear so versions of this story Ashley
[5427.04 - 5431.76] and I were actually talking about this
[5428.92 - 5434.00] because my daughter had skin issues
[5431.76 - 5435.88] temporarily directly following my
[5434.00 - 5437.44] exposure to all the gasoline that I was
[5435.88 - 5440.64] sprayed with while I was breastfeeding
[5437.44 - 5442.32] her I have texts from Ashley saying that
[5440.64 - 5444.36] Anthony told her to cut out nuts and
[5442.32 - 5446.80] seeds specifically because of the
[5444.36 - 5449.56] Arginine and that other fats like olive
[5446.80 - 5451.84] oil were okay and cooked squashes were
[5449.56 - 5454.32] okay and that he suggested bringing in
[5451.84 - 5457.80] cooked squashes again along with
[5454.32 - 5457.80] bringing in lots of green
[5457.96 - 5463.64] juices yeah okay
[5461.48 - 5467.44] so now I'm
[5463.64 - 5469.40] wondering it's I mean years ago Ashley
[5467.44 - 5471.00] in all all these false stories I'm sure
[5469.40 - 5472.48] Ashley years ago told you a lot of the
[5471.00 - 5475.08] false stories that we've debunked in
[5472.48 - 5477.72] these podcasts like the origin of the
[5475.08 - 5480.52] breast lump Discovery and the infamous
[5477.72 - 5482.92] cat story and it's got to feel really
[5480.52 - 5485.08] weird to look back and realize that you
[5482.92 - 5487.00] too were told so many untrue stories
[5485.08 - 5489.56] that were Ashley's foundational building
[5487.00 - 5492.56] blocks to get Robbie and the others on
[5489.56 - 5494.72] board to try to take down the medical
[5492.56 - 5496.96] medium Community it has been really
[5494.72 - 5499.40] upsetting to see this story evolve after
[5496.96 - 5502.00] seeing Ashley tell her healing story at
[5499.40 - 5503.60] the medical medium live event I know
[5502.00 - 5506.20] some of you remember it or you remember
[5503.60 - 5510.84] hearing about it Ashley herself was
[5506.20 - 5513.20] suffering and I mean really suffering
[5510.84 - 5516.28] and hearing her words firsthand and
[5513.20 - 5519.36] seeing her life turn around and now for
[5516.28 - 5522.28] her to do this it doesn't make much
[5519.36 - 5524.76] sense to me the very information that
[5522.28 - 5528.24] saved her life and these are her words
[5524.76 - 5530.80] not mine and saved my life and several
[5528.24 - 5533.84] of the other practitioners were
[5530.80 - 5536.76] plotters and now to twist it and to
[5533.84 - 5541.32] trash it and to manipulate it into an
[5536.76 - 5545.00] article and into an agenda is just
[5541.32 - 5548.36] upsetting she has been trying so hard to
[5545.00 - 5550.80] convince everyone out there of things
[5548.36 - 5553.24] that are simply not true about Anthony
[5550.80 - 5554.92] and about this situation she tried to
[5553.24 - 5557.92] Corner me and make me believe things
[5554.92 - 5560.32] that are not true Anthony saved my life
[5557.92 - 5562.24] and I've watched thousands of Miracles
[5560.32 - 5565.32] over the years thanks to this
[5562.24 - 5568.64] information there is such a clear agenda
[5565.32 - 5570.44] here and I actually feel really bad for
[5568.64 - 5573.36] everyone who has been swallowed up by
[5570.44 - 5576.56] this so many of them have been saved by
[5573.36 - 5579.72] this same information thanks to Anthony
[5576.56 - 5582.64] and I know very personally that he has
[5579.72 - 5587.04] helped most of these plotters some of
[5582.64 - 5590.64] them in their Darkest Hour even after
[5587.04 - 5593.16] Stephanie's death even when they have
[5590.64 - 5596.76] walked away from the information but
[5593.16 - 5596.76] that just tells you who Anthony
[5596.96 - 5600.36] is
[5598.52 - 5604.24] yeah
[5600.36 - 5607.52] wow I just have to say how sorry I am
[5604.24 - 5609.56] again that Ashley targeted you and your
[5607.52 - 5612.04] family came the way that she did in so
[5609.56 - 5613.24] many different instances she clearly
[5612.04 - 5616.08] didn't know the facts about the
[5613.24 - 5619.00] Stephanie story she just felt entitled
[5616.08 - 5621.24] apparently to say whatever she wanted
[5619.00 - 5623.44] she said herself in her text to you that
[5621.24 - 5625.28] she didn't care about any of the people
[5623.44 - 5629.24] in the medical medium Community who she
[5625.28 - 5631.84] hurt with her 2020 posts if Ashley had
[5629.24 - 5633.84] genuine questions or concerns about what
[5631.84 - 5636.60] had happened with Stephanie if she had
[5633.84 - 5638.00] any real interest in pursuing the truth
[5636.60 - 5640.92] she could have asked Anthony about
[5638.00 - 5644.68] anything she never did she could have
[5640.92 - 5648.16] asked you she never did she decided to
[5644.68 - 5650.12] take it public only a few months after
[5648.16 - 5652.28] still trying to sell the medical medium
[5650.12 - 5655.68] community on her self-proclaimed
[5652.28 - 5658.60] expensive Retreats with celery juice and
[5655.68 - 5661.24] a weight loss plan she tried to act like
[5658.60 - 5664.36] some kind of hero or whistleblower when
[5661.24 - 5666.76] she used a completely false story Ashley
[5664.36 - 5669.68] exploited Stephanie and her private
[5666.76 - 5673.00] information which is the saddest part
[5669.68 - 5674.88] yeah she caused outrage and Chaos in the
[5673.00 - 5677.56] medical medium Community with her false
[5674.88 - 5679.52] stories she put you and others in a
[5677.56 - 5681.88] situation where you'd have to defend the
[5679.52 - 5683.72] truth and then she had the nerve to
[5681.88 - 5686.52] attack you for
[5683.72 - 5688.92] it yeah she attacked my family my
[5686.52 - 5690.56] children my profession and I just want
[5688.92 - 5693.80] to talk about her weight loss book for a
[5690.56 - 5695.96] second twisting the information and
[5693.80 - 5699.08] claiming to be an expert Beyond
[5695.96 - 5700.84] Anthony's books I don't quite understand
[5699.08 - 5704.56] it Amber but I can tell you that it
[5700.84 - 5707.72] confused a lot of people Ashley's ebook
[5704.56 - 5710.48] was targeting postpartum women and it
[5707.72 - 5714.16] was a weight loss plan with portion
[5710.48 - 5716.08] sizes in ounce amounts I consulted with
[5714.16 - 5718.96] a lot of postpartum women who were
[5716.08 - 5721.00] influenced by Ashley's ebook to eat less
[5718.96 - 5724.04] food and restrict their calories as a
[5721.00 - 5725.48] means of rapid weight loss they were
[5724.04 - 5726.96] under the impression that they were
[5725.48 - 5728.88] still following medical medium
[5726.96 - 5732.12] information when medical medium
[5728.88 - 5734.00] information does not restrict calories
[5732.12 - 5735.36] they were just following Ashley's
[5734.00 - 5737.76] Twisted
[5735.36 - 5739.92] information a lot of these women had
[5737.76 - 5741.76] their supply of breast milk drop because
[5739.92 - 5743.44] they were not eating enough and some of
[5741.76 - 5745.68] them even blamed medical medium
[5743.44 - 5747.68] information for that when it it wasn't
[5745.68 - 5750.32] medical medium information it was
[5747.68 - 5752.36] Ashley's portion controlled information
[5750.32 - 5754.28] that she was marketing to the community
[5752.36 - 5756.40] and it was so
[5754.28 - 5760.00] irresponsible Ashley has done a lot of
[5756.40 - 5763.52] damage I'm hurt I'm lost I'm traumatized
[5760.00 - 5767.12] by all of it and I just wanted to
[5763.52 - 5768.48] stop yeah yeah that's crazy that you've
[5767.12 - 5772.96] had that you had those direct
[5768.48 - 5776.00] experiences and uh with the impact that
[5772.96 - 5779.28] Ashley's that her weight loss ebook had
[5776.00 - 5781.96] on women particularly postpartum women
[5779.28 - 5784.24] in the community that's extremely sad
[5781.96 - 5787.72] and Ashley really is the original of
[5784.24 - 5790.36] twisting medical medium information and
[5787.72 - 5793.60] um she's had a lot of influence on how
[5790.36 - 5795.72] that's happened in more recent times
[5793.60 - 5799.92] even you know with other people in other
[5795.72 - 5802.68] cases and it's all really sad and Ashley
[5799.92 - 5804.52] has indeed done a lot of damage and
[5802.68 - 5806.72] that's why it's so important that we're
[5804.52 - 5808.96] here you know to set the record straight
[5806.72 - 5812.16] to help stop Ashley and the plotters
[5808.96 - 5814.16] from misleading deceiving hurting or
[5812.16 - 5816.60] taking the chance to heal away
[5814.16 - 5818.20] from anyone else so thank you very much
[5816.60 - 5820.00] Kim for coming on I know that you're a
[5818.20 - 5822.28] busy mom of three little ones and that

[5823.72 - 5828.12] lot of these really difficult
[5825.44 - 5831.40] experiences and I appreciate both of you
[5828.12 - 5834.04] very much it's unfortunate that we had
[5831.40 - 5836.36] to get together for something like this
[5834.04 - 5839.36] setting the record straight I'm sure the
[5836.36 - 5841.48] medical medium community and anyone even
[5839.36 - 5843.56] outside of the medical medium Community
[5841.48 - 5845.96] truly appreciates your caring and
[5843.56 - 5848.52] willingness to get the truth out there
[5845.96 - 5850.00] thank you Kim thank you guys I
[5848.52 - 5853.32] appreciate you
[5850.00 - 5855.96] both thanks
[5853.32 - 5858.44] than as we are in the process of
[5855.96 - 5860.40] exposing Ashley and her organized
[5858.44 - 5862.84] hateful group for who and what they
[5860.40 - 5864.80] really are it's important to take note
[5862.84 - 5867.28] of their tactics and patterns that are
[5864.80 - 5869.72] likely to follow the plotters have a
[5867.28 - 5872.80] documented history of initiating attacks
[5869.72 - 5875.12] using lies and misinformation and then
[5872.80 - 5878.20] upon getting called out and corrected
[5875.12 - 5880.84] trying to flip it and play victim that
[5878.20 - 5883.40] is not going to work here all this group
[5880.84 - 5885.64] has done is spread verifiable lies and
[5883.40 - 5888.32] falsities they've carelessly attacked
[5885.64 - 5890.44] and harmed many innocent people they've
[5888.32 - 5892.20] used and exploited deceased individuals
[5890.44 - 5894.92] and others in the process of trying to
[5892.20 - 5897.52] get what they want they've repeatedly
[5894.92 - 5899.40] explicitly expressed the intent to harm
[5897.52 - 5901.12] medical medium and they've even
[5899.40 - 5903.20] deliberately tried to stop Anthony from
[5901.12 - 5906.00] doing a free event to support and raise
[5903.20 - 5908.16] money for the community we have every
[5906.00 - 5910.64] right to set the record straight and to
[5908.16 - 5912.52] defend the truth with facts and evidence
[5910.64 - 5914.08] and to defend the chronically ill
[5912.52 - 5916.88] against the malicious attacks of this
[5914.08 - 5920.32] group and we are going to continue to do
[5916.88 - 5923.04] so we expect the plotters to evade and
[5920.32 - 5924.92] ignore what they have done wrong we
[5923.04 - 5927.88] expect them to continue to lie and
[5924.92 - 5930.84] spread falsities we expect them to Pivot
[5927.88 - 5934.04] onto something new they'll make up and
[5930.84 - 5937.00] we expect them to skew and alter d data
[5934.04 - 5939.72] and to hide critical pieces of evidence
[5937.00 - 5942.72] that undermines their entire campaign we
[5939.72 - 5945.04] also expect the plotters to fabricate
[5942.72 - 5947.00] explanations as they do everything they
[5945.04 - 5950.04] can to try to discredit what we're
[5947.00 - 5953.60] exposing them for having done and said
[5950.04 - 5956.40] in their own words but we are using
[5953.60 - 5960.16] their own text messages voice messages
[5956.40 - 5962.48] social media posts words that they spoke
[5960.16 - 5965.76] on recorded calls and other published
