[1.32 - 7.76] how many people do you know who struggle
[4.32 - 10.24] with their health chances are whether
[7.76 - 14.52] they show it or not most of the people
[10.24 - 17.60] in your life do and chances are you're
[14.52 - 21.40] one of them whether you're dealing with
[17.60 - 25.92] anxiety depression endometriosis acne
[21.40 - 28.48] eczema autoimmune thyroid lime brain fog
[25.92 - 31.24] fatigue or any other symptom or
[28.48 - 34.52] condition you're far from from
[31.24 - 38.64] alone living with symptoms has become
[34.52 - 41.76] The New Normal so no more guessing games
[38.64 - 45.32] it's time to get answers welcome to the
[41.76 - 47.88] medical medium podcast I'm Anthony
[45.32 - 51.00] Williams we're talking about natural
[47.88 - 54.56] flavors natural flavoring sounds good
[51.00 - 56.96] doesn't it all natural can't be bad the
[54.56 - 59.68] thing is there's something kind of
[56.96 - 62.36] sinister we don't know about natural
[59.68 - 66.12] flavor flavoring it's everywhere it's in
[62.36 - 70.48] everything did you know that it appeared
[66.12 - 73.60] after something really bad disappeared H
[70.48 - 76.20] wonder how they did that bait and switch
[73.60 - 80.56] get ready fasten your seat belts because
[76.20 - 80.56] we're going on a natural flavor
[82.64 - 91.28] ride let see oh so sorry sorry ma'am
[86.96 - 93.40] yeah okay God what am I looking for
[91.28 - 97.56] again cereal cereal cereal that's on the
[93.40 - 97.56] list all right oh here they
[98.28 - 102.76] are
[100.40 - 107.20] ingredients whole
[102.76 - 109.48] oats natural flavors why is everything
[107.20 - 114.12] have natural flavors I don't understand
[109.48 - 117.32] this sorry no I'm yeah that's my that's
[114.12 - 121.04] my Carriage right over there yeah thank
[117.32 - 124.44] you um I can't find anything without
[121.04 - 126.88] natural flavors I don't understand what
[124.44 - 128.28] what is going on here my doctor's not
[126.88 - 129.60] telling me about natural flavors
[128.28 - 132.04] nobody's telling me about natural
[129.60 - 134.76] flavors but I see it all right let me
[132.04 - 138.92] just check my coconut water really quick
[134.76 - 142.84] natural flavors my coconut water what is
[138.92 - 146.16] this let me check my other package chips
[142.84 - 148.76] that I got the healthy ones I love so
[146.16 - 154.92] much natural
[148.76 - 157.12] flavors what is going on I don't get it
[154.92 - 160.40] I've been shouting about natural flavors
[157.12 - 164.12] for years ever since they did the
[160.40 - 165.44] switcheroo the great bait and switch the
[164.12 - 168.36] Old
[165.44 - 170.20] bamboozle what happened was there was
[168.36 - 175.32] something in everybody's ingredient list
[170.20 - 179.60] in everything they ate it was called M
[175.32 - 182.16] SG mono sodium glutamate you know funny
[179.60 - 185.68] thing thing is is it was everywhere it
[182.16 - 189.40] was in every single Frozen TV dinner it
[185.68 - 191.64] was in every single Frozen dish it was
[189.40 - 195.52] in all the restaurant Foods everywhere
[191.64 - 199.92] it was in fast foods takeout but it was
[195.52 - 202.96] in snack foods as well sauces dips
[199.92 - 206.08] dressings it was in everything it was in
[202.96 - 209.88] all canned food anything canned canned
[206.08 - 211.76] beans canned fruit it was in canned
[209.88 - 214.40] vegetables canned peas canned green
[211.76 - 217.92] beans anything canned at all canned
[214.40 - 221.68] tomato sauce it was in everything Jarred
[217.92 - 224.72] Jarred pickles Jarred olives jellies
[221.68 - 228.12] jams peanut butter almond butter and
[224.72 - 230.92] even ice cream any kind of ice cream or
[228.12 - 235.16] any kind of dairy products like milk
[230.92 - 238.32] yeah milk cheese butter and then candy
[235.16 - 242.20] bars chocolate bars any kind of candy
[238.32 - 244.52] really MS G was in almost everything but
[242.20 - 247.80] here's the interesting part it was
[244.52 - 249.68] listed in the ingredient list you look
[247.80 - 251.36] at the back of a jar of pickles and
[249.68 - 254.48] you'll see
[251.36 - 257.64] MSG you look at the back of a pack of
[254.48 - 260.36] cookies and you'll see MSG it was always
[257.64 - 264.20] in the list it was written there the
[260.36 - 269.12] amount of MSG was never disclosed there
[264.20 - 270.28] wasn't like well 500 Mig of MSG 750 Mig
[269.12 - 273.40] of MSG
[270.28 - 275.80] 10,000 mg of MSG the reason why it
[273.40 - 278.64] wasn't disclosed because in different
[275.80 - 281.52] packages different foods it would be
[278.64 - 284.04] like over the top generous amounts
[281.52 - 288.68] placed into everybody's food they were
[284.04 - 292.04] eating and why because it made it taste
[288.68 - 295.68] good not only taste good it made you
[292.04 - 298.68] want to go back for more it was highly
[295.68 - 300.08] addictive and when those neurons in your
[298.68 - 301.48] brain
[300.08 - 305.16] received that
[301.48 - 308.56] MSG it made you remember the package you
[305.16 - 309.88] ate it from like wow those chips are so
[308.56 - 311.80] good I'm going back I'm going to get
[309.88 - 313.12] another bag next time in the store
[311.80 - 314.92] getting another bag of those chips I'm
[313.12 - 317.24] going to grab three bags of those chips
[314.92 - 320.92] and I'm going to eat one in the car on
[317.24 - 325.08] the way home it was the Wild West a food
[320.92 - 329.20] company can put 10,000 milligrams per
[325.08 - 330.04] serving of MSG in their food another
[329.20 - 334.72] company
[330.04 - 339.60] might only put 200 mg another company
[334.72 - 342.76] 30,000 mg and the MSG industry chemical
[339.60 - 345.56] companies that actually created it were
[342.76 - 350.64] booming the food chemical industry was
[345.56 - 353.12] taking off and MSG was the pilot light
[350.64 - 355.00] and at the very same time MSG was really
[353.12 - 357.40] taking off and the food chemical
[355.00 - 359.56] industry was really taking advantage of
[357.40 - 362.24] putting it in every single food for
[359.56 - 366.40] everybody something else was happening
[362.24 - 369.04] artificial flavors artificial flavoring
[366.40 - 373.12] was big food chemical companies were not
[369.04 - 375.76] only creating MSG synthetically but they
[373.12 - 377.96] were creating artificial flavors
[375.76 - 381.24] synthetically and artificial flavors
[377.96 - 384.20] were in everything people didn't care it
[381.24 - 387.16] was almost in every single food this was
[384.20 - 388.84] pretty much the Golden Age of food this
[387.16 - 390.92] is when people really didn't look at the
[388.84 - 393.56] ingredient list nobody cared what was in
[390.92 - 395.44] it it would be like canned the peas
[393.56 - 398.20] that's all who cares it's just a can of
[395.44 - 400.76] peas doesn't matter what's in there um
[398.20 - 404.52] TV dinner doesn't matter what's in there
[400.76 - 407.28] just TV dinner steak fries a little
[404.52 - 409.56] dessert to TV dinner who cares what's in
[407.28 - 411.20] there right macaroni and cheese doesn't
[409.56 - 413.88] matter what's in there this was the
[411.20 - 416.16] Golden Age It's when no one cared about
[413.88 - 418.80] the ingredient list and the food
[416.16 - 422.28] corporations knew this and they were
[418.80 - 425.00] running with it and the food chemist
[422.28 - 427.60] manufacturers ran with this they knew
[425.00 - 431.20] this too nobody cared what was in the
[427.60 - 433.20] food now we're moving into the 70s and
[431.20 - 435.84] there were people that were
[433.20 - 438.16] sensitive they realized they would get a
[435.84 - 440.48] headache feel sick not feel good after
[438.16 - 442.36] eating a meal this had nothing to do
[440.48 - 444.72] with the health movement had nothing to
[442.36 - 447.04] do with health and wellness or the
[444.72 - 449.72] movement of healing this was just
[447.04 - 452.52] regular people that were feeling kind of
[449.72 - 454.80] headachy and sick and decided to look at
[452.52 - 456.88] the back of the package these were
[454.80 - 459.64] mainstream people these weren't that
[456.88 - 462.32] group of people that went off the grid
[459.64 - 463.96] decided to live by the land you know
[462.32 - 466.64] grow their own food make their own
[463.96 - 469.40] butter back to the Landers got their own
[466.64 - 472.28] beans and rice going in bulk and lived
[469.40 - 474.88] in nature it wasn't that crowd and it
[472.28 - 476.84] wasn't the crowd that was doing aerobics
[474.88 - 478.92] exercising a little bit worried about
[476.84 - 482.16] Wellness to some degree that that group
[478.92 - 484.56] of people either it was mainstream all
[482.16 - 486.36] the way and they decided to look at the
[484.56 - 488.84] back of the package because they weren't
[486.36 - 491.32] feeling good conventional minded
[488.84 - 493.12] everyday people that started to read the
[491.32 - 496.40] back of the packages cuz they weren't
[493.12 - 499.24] feeling good saw the MSG and made the
[496.40 - 501.44] connection now at this point in time the
[499.24 - 503.88] food chemistry manufacturing world was
[501.44 - 505.64] in high gear with the MSG production
[503.88 - 508.72] there was already a booming business
[505.64 - 511.04] with it so thousands upon thousands of
[508.72 - 513.20] pounds were leaving the factories and
[511.04 - 516.92] heading to the food manufacturing
[513.20 - 519.88] facilities MSG was booming crazy thing
[516.92 - 523.64] is people were getting aware and it was
[519.88 - 526.68] booming and then that collided together
[523.64 - 529.28] the awareness and the booming both
[526.68 - 531.24] collided the heads of the MSG
[529.28 - 535.08] manufacturing world were sitting in
[531.24 - 537.84] their boardroom and they were saying oh
[535.08 - 540.64] crap we got a problem now they come a
[537.84 - 543.44] long way from from where it originated
[540.64 - 546.40] MSG commercial production started in
[543.44 - 549.44] 1909 after a Japanese Professor who was
[546.40 - 552.28] a chemist figured out how to isolate
[549.44 - 555.84] glutamate from seaweed broth commercial
[552.28 - 558.60] production was about souping large Vats
[555.84 - 561.04] of broth and then dehydrating the broth
[558.60 - 562.92] so the white powder can be singled out
[561.04 - 565.04] and then bagged up sold to restaurants
[562.92 - 568.16] around the world but that was the
[565.04 - 569.76] original old innocent way of doing it
[568.16 - 572.04] that's not what we have today and it
[569.76 - 575.44] wasn't what we had in the' 60s 7s and
[572.04 - 578.96] 80s either the old way was too expensive
[575.44 - 581.40] cumbersome it was crude and it wasn't
[578.96 - 584.52] even that toxic compared to where it
[581.40 - 587.40] went later food chemical companies
[584.52 - 590.84] didn't exist 100 years ago food
[587.40 - 594.32] companies existed but not food chemical
[590.84 - 596.40] corporations that manipulated food and
[594.32 - 600.12] when these food chemical manufacturing
[596.40 - 603.48] companies got wind of how addictive MSG
[600.12 - 606.72] was they had to recreate the process in
[603.48 - 608.76] an inexpensive way but potent and much
[606.72 - 612.32] stronger than the original manufacturing
[608.76 - 615.08] of MSG in 1909 in the 20th century there
[612.32 - 617.80] was a conditioning with how we taste it
[615.08 - 620.60] and flavored food Salt was always there
[617.80 - 622.96] it was always on the table fine Pepper
[620.60 - 626.28] too but this is beyond just salt and
[622.96 - 628.48] pepper the flavor games began the food
[626.28 - 631.60] chemical companies knew this this was
[628.48 - 634.84] about ating to another flavoring and
[631.60 - 637.16] another taste this was MSG other food
[634.84 - 639.28] chemicals too in the artificial
[637.16 - 641.96] flavorings people got used to
[639.28 - 644.72] stimulation from eating cheesy crunchy
[641.96 - 647.96] things that came out of a bag chips with
[644.72 - 649.60] the most intense flavoring after you
[647.96 - 651.20] finish up a bag you look at your
[649.60 - 653.92] fingertips and they're all red and
[651.20 - 656.48] orange looking with a powder on there
[653.92 - 659.12] those intense flavors from the chemical
[656.48 - 662.08] corporations they stimulate the neurons
[659.12 - 665.56] that run the senses older Generations
[662.08 - 667.60] that were raised on just plain old food
[665.56 - 670.80] ended up learning how to eat all these
[667.60 - 674.24] high sensory intense Flav and then
[670.80 - 676.44] people now are raised on instead of old
[674.24 - 678.88] plain food they're raised on these
[676.44 - 681.32] intense flavors now the younger
[678.88 - 683.60] Generations are highly addicted highly
[681.32 - 685.52] addicted to all these chemical Food
[683.60 - 687.00] flavors well I know what you're thinking
[685.52 - 688.44] though you're not one of them right
[687.00 - 691.00] because you're eating all the healthier
[688.44 - 693.88] snacks and the healthier flavored foods
[691.00 - 695.76] and all the good different treats that
[693.88 - 697.96] seem like there's nothing bad in them
[695.76 - 700.28] right so you're not one of the people
[697.96 - 704.12] that are reaching their hands in those
[700.28 - 706.88] real orangey red cheesy crunchy things
[704.12 - 708.52] in the bag you're someone who is maybe
[706.88 - 710.48] picking healthier options like in the
[708.52 - 712.32] restaurants you're picking healthy
[710.48 - 714.24] options on the menus and then when
[712.32 - 716.04] you're in the store at the health market
[714.24 - 718.28] health food store you're picking
[716.04 - 720.16] healthier packaged foods that doesn't
[718.28 - 722.76] look like it has anything bad in it or
[720.16 - 725.08] maybe it's organic and not GMO and
[722.76 - 728.12] you're like no that's not me I'm not
[725.08 - 731.00] doing the real junky stuff the real fake
[728.12 - 732.44] garbage but youve been fold in a way
[731.00 - 735.84] that I'm going to fill you in on in a
[732.44 - 739.36] little bit it's also why when someone
[735.84 - 741.24] goes and eats cleaner and cleaner and
[739.36 - 743.68] they're avoiding any of the packaged
[741.24 - 746.56] Foods or restaurant Foods it gets really
[743.68 - 749.16] boring really quick the reason you can
[746.56 - 751.16] get bored really quick is because you're
[749.16 - 752.96] coming off the ride you're coming off
[751.16 - 755.48] the addiction you're going through
[752.96 - 757.92] withdrawal you're coming off of the food
[755.48 - 760.36] chemical ride it also leads to this
[757.92 - 762.64] problem when someone actually stays away
[760.36 - 765.04] from the food chemicals or they try to
[762.64 - 768.44] clean up maybe do a cleanse a really
[765.04 - 771.60] healthy one like a plain steamed potato
[768.44 - 773.20] or some bananas it gets really old fast
[771.60 - 776.00] and then you feel like you're
[773.20 - 778.36] restricted it's hard to eat without all
[776.00 - 781.24] that brain excitement that addiction the
[778.36 - 782.88] food chemicals hitting all the neurons
[781.24 - 784.80] it's like when you see somebody out
[782.88 - 786.80] there and they get sick they get all
[784.80 - 788.84] these symptoms and they have to dial it
[786.80 - 790.84] back learn how to heal and maybe they'll
[788.84 - 792.76] find some really good information maybe
[790.84 - 794.48] they'll pick up a medical medium book
[792.76 - 796.40] and they'll learn how to Mono eat for a
[794.48 - 799.00] while and they'll do it and their
[796.40 - 800.64] symptoms go away and they start healing
[799.00 - 802.44] they get better because they've been
[800.64 - 804.60] holding back all these toxic foods
[802.44 - 806.96] they've been allowing their body to heal
[804.60 - 808.36] they've been not feeding their pathogens
[806.96 - 809.96] from all the different foods that are
[808.36 - 812.24] bad for them and they're staying away
[809.96 - 814.24] from all the bad flavorings and all of
[812.24 - 817.48] the tricks that are inside food that
[814.24 - 819.76] food chemical Industries create and then
[817.48 - 821.96] they dropped their guard they got better
[819.76 - 824.16] enough better enough to experience other
[821.96 - 826.12] things again or experience the old
[824.16 - 828.44] things in their old life when they were
[826.12 - 830.64] sick so they go out to a restaurant they
[828.44 - 833.60] order a vegan pizza maybe something that
[830.64 - 836.40] has all that flavor and their mind is
[833.60 - 838.24] blown their brain is just totally like
[836.40 - 840.88] overloaded from those senses that
[838.24 - 843.44] intense flavors back it hits every
[840.88 - 846.16] single neuron it's excitement it's a
[843.44 - 848.40] high and a happiness comes over and
[846.16 - 850.32] takes over and then you hear friends and
[848.40 - 852.68] family saying why can't you eat in
[850.32 - 854.80] moderation why are you so restrictive
[852.68 - 858.00] and you almost forget that you had a
[854.80 - 860.20] restrict to heal to do the right things
[858.00 - 862.76] to recover but now since you're better
[860.20 - 865.00] it's like why am I eating that way why
[862.76 - 867.56] should I just have a plain potato why
[865.00 - 869.44] can't I just eat what I want in balance
[867.56 - 871.44] in moderation
[869.44 - 873.52] now you're on the addictive train again
[871.44 - 876.00] the food train and then you go for
[873.52 - 877.64] another vegan pizza and then you go for
[876.00 - 879.36] another treat and then you go with a

[1021.80 - 1025.88] food they're watching you with your diet
[1024.44 - 1028.00] and they're reminding you every second
[1025.88 - 1029.92] how you're missing out then you start
[1028.00 - 1031.88] feeling down about yourself you start
[1029.92 - 1033.84] thinking what am I doing why am I
[1031.88 - 1035.96] restricting how come I can't eat like
[1033.84 - 1038.04] everybody else but what's really
[1035.96 - 1040.24] happening is you broke your addiction
[1038.04 - 1042.56] for a little while you're not living off
[1040.24 - 1044.84] all that flavor you went through
[1042.56 - 1046.92] withdrawal long enough to know what it's
[1044.84 - 1048.48] like you lost a few pounds you started
[1046.92 - 1050.08] feeling a little bit better you didn't
[1048.48 - 1052.24] didn't cheat so much and maybe you
[1050.08 - 1054.56] didn't cheat at all for a while what's
[1052.24 - 1057.52] really happening though is you broke
[1054.56 - 1060.04] ownership you were owned well that's the
[1057.52 - 1063.08] thing the flavor companies they own all
[1060.04 - 1065.76] of us that's the whole game the flavor
[1063.08 - 1067.64] industry wants to own everybody the
[1065.76 - 1069.64] chemical flavor industry knows you're
[1067.64 - 1071.68] going to lose you're going to lose the
[1069.64 - 1073.68] battle no way you're going to be able to
[1071.68 - 1076.00] hang in there that long they know they
[1073.68 - 1077.48] got you they know they got everybody
[1076.00 - 1079.88] they know that eventually you're going
[1077.48 - 1082.28] to be peer pressured by somebody family
[1079.88 - 1084.16] friends people you know loved ones
[1082.28 - 1086.40] anybody co-workers and they know the day
[1084.16 - 1088.80] is going to come and the food chemical
[1086.40 - 1091.08] Industries think tanks you know the
[1088.80 - 1093.84] group of people that know you better
[1091.08 - 1096.08] than you know you sometimes those think
[1093.84 - 1098.76] tanks no you're going to fall into that
[1096.08 - 1101.76] whole thing of hey I'm craving it maybe
[1098.76 - 1104.80] my body needs it this time and those
[1101.76 - 1107.76] think tanks know you're going to fall
[1104.80 - 1109.88] prey to that old trick I just needed a
[1107.76 - 1111.68] little s salt I was craving a little
[1109.88 - 1114.16] salt that's why I went with that bag of
[1111.68 - 1116.80] chips that's why I went with that fast
[1114.16 - 1119.60] food restaurant french fries but if
[1116.80 - 1123.32] that's the case why can't you just try a
[1119.60 - 1126.40] steamed potato plain with a Sprinkle of
[1123.32 - 1129.12] a little salt on there no it doesn't do
[1126.40 - 1131.88] the trick and how come homemade french
[1129.12 - 1134.28] fries made at home baked in the oven or
[1131.88 - 1136.04] in an air fryer just don't taste like
[1134.28 - 1137.60] the same thing when you go through the
[1136.04 - 1139.36] fast food restaurant and you get some
[1137.60 - 1142.48] french fries there there because it's
[1139.36 - 1146.76] not just salt not even homemade french
[1142.48 - 1149.64] fries fried in oil will satisfy you like
[1146.76 - 1152.76] a french fry somewhere in a restaurant
[1149.64 - 1154.52] so you end up coming off the Bland train
[1152.76 - 1156.80] and you end up cheating and then you're
[1154.52 - 1159.08] like wow that's what I remember but it's
[1156.80 - 1162.32] even more exciting than ever before the
[1159.08 - 1164.88] stimulation is crazy this was amazing
[1162.32 - 1166.96] food your adrenaline's pumping you're
[1164.88 - 1168.76] laughing with friends you can't believe
[1166.96 - 1171.00] how awesome the food is is and now
[1168.76 - 1174.08] you're like why can't I do this another
[1171.00 - 1175.88] time why am I restricting so much now
[1174.08 - 1177.72] you're back in it with everybody else
[1175.88 - 1179.84] you're on a train again but the think
[1177.72 - 1181.88] tanks know that that's the whole point
[1179.84 - 1184.00] chemical food industry knows this is
[1181.88 - 1185.60] going to happen and they love it they
[1184.00 - 1188.00] know you're going to join the losing
[1185.60 - 1190.36] team now don't get confused with herbs
[1188.00 - 1193.00] and spices that's not what we're talking
[1190.36 - 1195.00] about here we're not saying hey you
[1193.00 - 1197.44] can't shake a little tomb brick on your
[1195.00 - 1200.24] meal or you got a little Cayenne or
[1197.44 - 1202.52] oregano we're not talking about clean
[1200.24 - 1206.60] herbs and
[1202.52 - 1210.24] spices oh my God I can't wait for my
[1206.60 - 1213.44] meal to come yeah oh here's the
[1210.24 - 1215.48] waiter thank you thank you yeah can I
[1213.44 - 1219.04] have an next extra Fork
[1215.48 - 1219.04] right oh my
[1219.96 - 1228.88] God oh my God it's so good yeah so what
[1226.08 - 1232.56] were we talking about yeah
[1228.88 - 1232.56] I can't shove it in fast enough right
[1232.80 - 1237.20] now can I try your
[1235.16 - 1238.24] appetizer I'll order one for myself
[1237.20 - 1240.88] don't
[1238.24 - 1243.84] worry this is so good I've been off my
[1240.88 - 1246.80] diet right now for like what 2 days now
[1243.84 - 1248.52] and it's like I'm happy again I'm happy
[1246.80 - 1250.00] like what was I doing what was I
[1248.52 - 1252.80] thinking isn't there such thing as
[1250.00 - 1255.84] moderation and balance
[1252.80 - 1257.44] yeah yeah I was talking to this coach
[1255.84 - 1259.60] and the coach said that I can just eat
[1257.44 - 1261.96] what I want and still be happy but I'm
[1259.60 - 1264.00] trying to remember didn't I start eating
[1261.96 - 1266.84] really clean because and started eating
[1264.00 - 1269.20] really like fresh and no junk and
[1266.84 - 1270.52] garbage and no processed foods because I
[1269.20 - 1273.00] wasn't feeling good right and I had
[1270.52 - 1275.04] weight while I lost a few pounds yeah
[1273.00 - 1278.48] and now I feel like I can just start
[1275.04 - 1281.60] fresh oh my God this is so good I could
[1278.48 - 1284.32] do this like every day right now I know
[1281.60 - 1286.08] some people think they've escaped it all
[1284.32 - 1288.12] because they've figured out intermittent
[1286.08 - 1289.84] fasting for a while in their life and
[1288.12 - 1292.80] they're not a part of all this flavored
[1289.84 - 1294.28] game but it's actually the opposite
[1292.80 - 1296.80] they're doing the flavored chemical
[1294.28 - 1298.44] coffee drinks all day long and then at
[1296.80 - 1300.60] the end of the day they're eating
[1298.44 - 1303.08] anything their heart desires cuz they
[1300.60 - 1304.96] starve thems all day long and how do you
[1303.08 - 1307.12] get vanilla flavored coffee when there's
[1304.96 - 1309.68] no real vanilla in there and then when
[1307.12 - 1311.36] you eat you eat anything you want and
[1309.68 - 1313.56] they take pride in the fact that they
[1311.36 - 1316.16] can eat what they want and do eat what
[1313.56 - 1318.56] they want but that really means they
[1316.16 - 1321.20] really haven't escaped the whole that
[1318.56 - 1323.40] the food chemical companies have on them
[1321.20 - 1324.80] and then there's the athletes out there
[1323.40 - 1327.56] that work really hard with their
[1324.80 - 1329.16] athletic work and after they're done
[1327.56 - 1332.40] they award themselves with their
[1329.16 - 1334.88] favorite food like donuts or bagels or
[1332.40 - 1337.24] something cheesy usually something from
[1334.88 - 1339.60] their favorite restaurant and what's
[1337.24 - 1342.28] incredible is that these athletes
[1339.60 - 1344.60] they're in good shape they look amazing
[1342.28 - 1347.48] they're working hard everybody aspires
[1344.60 - 1349.96] to be like them but at the same time
[1347.48 - 1351.80] they're trap too and the chemical
[1349.96 - 1354.20] industry the food chemical industry
[1351.80 - 1356.16] knows this and when you talk to an
[1354.20 - 1358.28] athlete they'll tell you it's about
[1356.16 - 1360.04] balance and moderation and that's why
[1358.28 - 1361.92] they do it too they love their favorite
[1360.04 - 1364.16] foods they feel like they earned it they
[1361.92 - 1366.52] ran 20 miles they burned off all those
[1364.16 - 1370.00] calories why not eat our favorite Donuts
[1366.52 - 1374.20] now but the funny thing is the food
[1370.00 - 1377.40] chemical industry created the term
[1374.20 - 1379.80] balance and moderation they created it
[1377.40 - 1382.32] with the the pharmaceutical companies so
[1379.80 - 1384.76] that people go you know what I can have
[1382.32 - 1387.48] a little bit more of that toxic crap the
[1384.76 - 1390.08] industry pushed and promoted the balance
[1387.48 - 1392.96] of moderation narrative so that you
[1390.08 - 1395.72] would buy more chips and cookies and
[1392.96 - 1398.12] donuts and package food and drinks and
[1395.72 - 1400.20] restaurant food and any other foods from
[1398.12 - 1403.08] other food companies that they've sold
[1400.20 - 1405.52] their chemical additives to so let's go
[1403.08 - 1409.00] back to the Collision where the food
[1405.52 - 1411.04] chemical industry realized ocean it and
[1409.00 - 1413.56] people in the mainstream realized
[1411.04 - 1418.44] something's bad in these products the
[1413.56 - 1421.52] moment enough people realized MSG was
[1418.44 - 1424.40] doing something to them the moment they
[1421.52 - 1427.40] realized it was on the label and the
[1424.40 - 1431.76] moment they realized it was actually
[1427.40 - 1435.08] toxic in causing a problem the MSG
[1431.76 - 1438.04] realizations the MSG realization from
[1435.08 - 1440.20] the food chemical industry too where
[1438.04 - 1443.72] they're like oh my God they're figuring
[1440.20 - 1446.72] it out they're finding out what do we do
[1443.72 - 1451.48] the food chemical industry said to
[1446.72 - 1453.84] itself if we don't keep this stuff tasty
[1451.48 - 1456.92] addictive we're going to lose a lot of
[1453.84 - 1459.16] sales and the effect was going to happen
[1456.92 - 1460.64] from the highest part of the food chain
[1459.16 - 1463.04] down to the lowest part of the food
[1460.64 - 1464.64] chain the chemical manufacturing
[1463.04 - 1466.88] facilities which is the highest part of
[1464.64 - 1469.28] the food chain that were producing all
[1466.88 - 1471.56] of that MSG plus artificial flavoring
[1469.28 - 1473.72] and other kind of food chemicals too
[1471.56 - 1475.16] they were going to take a big hit
[1473.72 - 1477.36] because they were the ones that were
[1475.16 - 1479.80] selling all of that product all of that
[1477.36 - 1481.76] MSG to the other food corporations the
[1479.80 - 1483.60] food corporations that sell all the soft
[1481.76 - 1486.28] drinks and the drinks and the package
[1483.60 - 1488.56] foods and the bagged and packaged snacks
[1486.28 - 1491.28] and the next line on the food chain was
[1488.56 - 1494.60] the food chains meaning the restaurant
[1491.28 - 1496.76] business restaurant chains fast food
[1494.60 - 1498.52] they purchased all that MSG and all the
[1496.76 - 1500.20] other food chemicals too and were
[1498.52 - 1503.20] putting in it in all their chain
[1500.20 - 1505.44] restaurant Delights and tasty dishes but
[1503.20 - 1507.76] it didn't stop there and then all the
[1505.44 - 1510.56] other food businesses food companies
[1507.76 - 1512.76] that bottled and canned things they
[1510.56 - 1515.28] purchased the MSG and other food
[1512.76 - 1517.08] chemicals to put in all their different
[1515.28 - 1520.28] things you find on the Shelf all the
[1517.08 - 1523.20] bottled stuff all the Jarred pickles
[1520.28 - 1526.36] Jarred olives Jarred artichokes all the
[1523.20 - 1529.48] different jellies and jams mayos
[1526.36 - 1532.24] mustards ketchups dressings and then the
[1529.48 - 1534.96] next stop on the food chain Candy World
[1532.24 - 1537.52] chocolate bars candy bars all of those
[1534.96 - 1539.40] packed with MSG and then the next part
[1537.52 - 1541.40] of the food chain dropping down to the
[1539.40 - 1543.72] mom and pop stores mom and pop
[1541.40 - 1548.32] restaurants where it's condiments in
[1543.72 - 1551.44] bulk soy sauces vinegars tomato sauces
[1548.32 - 1553.88] peanut oil canola oil olive oil MSU was
[1551.44 - 1555.96] added to those bulk oils this was the
[1553.88 - 1557.88] wholesale market and this is the
[1555.96 - 1560.88] wholesale Market that was fed to the mom
[1557.88 - 1565.68] and pop stores and restaurants all laced
[1560.88 - 1568.76] with MSG the entire food chain business
[1565.68 - 1571.60] was infested with MSG and contaminated
[1568.76 - 1575.40] with food chemicals from the highest
[1571.60 - 1582.92] Echelon and beneath then the word got
[1575.40 - 1586.36] out MSG was toxic it was bad and then it
[1582.92 - 1589.40] disappeared like a ghost ship in the
[1586.36 - 1593.68] night the letters
[1589.40 - 1596.44] MSG disappeared off of all the labels
[1593.68 - 1600.00] all the labels in the food World changed
[1596.44 - 1603.04] but the recipe stayed the same emergency
[1600.00 - 1606.56] action was taken by the food chemical
[1603.04 - 1609.16] industry which was illegal because the
[1606.56 - 1611.92] word MSG monosodium glutamate was
[1609.16 - 1615.24] removed off of all the labels of every
[1611.92 - 1618.08] single food in the industry but yet MSG
[1615.24 - 1620.48] was still in the food all the same and
[1618.08 - 1623.60] then people got wise though they still
[1620.48 - 1625.76] weren't feeling good and so individuals
[1623.60 - 1628.32] looked into the products and were
[1625.76 - 1631.04] looking and searching for MSG it was
[1628.32 - 1634.04] still there this was during a time when
[1631.04 - 1636.80] food Chemical Testing was approachable
[1634.04 - 1640.12] the Layman can get food tested for
[1636.80 - 1643.04] Basics and actually see results a small
[1640.12 - 1646.36] window in time before the food chemical
[1643.04 - 1648.48] industry to control over almost
[1646.36 - 1651.88] everything when when the food chemical
[1648.48 - 1654.08] industry joined forces with big Pharma
[1651.88 - 1657.24] and determined what we allowed to truly
[1654.08 - 1659.92] see in our food and drugs and for the
[1657.24 - 1662.84] short moment of time in our history
[1659.92 - 1666.48] added MSG was no longer there it was
[1662.84 - 1671.12] removed it wasn't in the food anymore it
[1666.48 - 1674.40] disappeared but then it reappeared under
[1671.12 - 1677.92] different names different tags different
[1674.40 - 1680.24] ingredient words private deals were made
[1677.92 - 1682.40] behind the scenes with these
[1680.24 - 1684.20] organizations private deals
[1682.40 - 1687.20] grandfathered in that you're never
[1684.20 - 1690.40] allowed to know the MSG found its way
[1687.20 - 1692.88] back into the food under code names
[1690.40 - 1695.80] yeast artificial flavors fermented
[1692.88 - 1698.68] products fermented foods soy products
[1695.80 - 1702.60] Protein Isolate and so many more but
[1698.68 - 1705.72] there's a big one really scary one it's
[1702.60 - 1708.08] natural flavoring natural flavors why is
[1705.72 - 1710.56] it scary one reason
[1708.08 - 1714.88] it's so deceiving it's really a trick
[1710.56 - 1717.52] out it's natural all natural natural is
[1714.88 - 1720.72] great natural's good natural can be in
[1717.52 - 1723.08] any organic food it can be in any
[1720.72 - 1725.84] product that's healthy for you and all
[1723.08 - 1727.48] the people that wanted food transparency
[1725.84 - 1728.56] like they wanted transparency of what
[1727.48 - 1730.68] they're eating what they're feeding
[1728.56 - 1733.20] their children they think they're
[1730.68 - 1736.24] getting that transparency natural
[1733.20 - 1738.00] flavors what could go wrong think about
[1736.24 - 1739.92] all the people in the health world World
[1738.00 - 1741.60] Health and Wellness World they care
[1739.92 - 1744.36] about what they're putting in their body
[1741.60 - 1747.44] they look at everything they read
[1744.36 - 1750.32] everything moms buy juice boxes juice
[1747.44 - 1753.00] boxes say apple juice and then natural
[1750.32 - 1756.28] flavors underneath it almost every
[1753.00 - 1758.64] single health food out there has natural
[1756.28 - 1760.88] flavors in it one way or another
[1758.64 - 1762.76] including supplements any kind of
[1760.88 - 1764.24] supplementation you'll see natural
[1762.76 - 1766.64] flavors in there now here's where it
[1764.24 - 1768.24] gets really confusing you'll see organic
[1766.64 - 1770.04] natural flavors
[1768.24 - 1772.88] still the same thing we're going to talk
[1770.04 - 1777.24] about that in a minute organic flavoring
[1772.88 - 1780.40] organic vanilla flavor vanilla flavoring
[1777.24 - 1783.28] vanilla flavors Berry flavor organic
[1780.40 - 1785.64] Berry flavor any kind of natural
[1783.28 - 1787.88] flavoring but it doesn't stop there it
[1785.64 - 1790.08] might say fruit flavoring or it might
[1787.88 - 1791.72] say caramel flavoring or it might say
[1790.08 - 1793.92] something else but it never stops
[1791.72 - 1796.56] there's so many different versions and
[1793.92 - 1798.68] different types of flavors and then the
[1796.56 - 1802.12] individual fruit names or vegetable
[1798.68 - 1804.04] names it'll be like Blackberry flavoring
[1802.12 - 1805.60] raspberry flavoring and then you think
[1804.04 - 1808.16] it's just a raspberry that was put in
[1805.60 - 1809.96] there but it's not just because you hear
[1808.16 - 1811.64] the word natural flavors and then you
[1809.96 - 1813.92] read the package and you're like well it
[1811.64 - 1818.36] doesn't say natural flavors on here it
[1813.92 - 1820.92] says poisonberry or Blackberry flavoring
[1818.36 - 1822.44] or fruit flavoring I'm off the hook
[1820.92 - 1824.96] everything's okay it's not natural
[1822.44 - 1827.92] flavors but you're not off the hook it's
[1824.96 - 1830.40] not okay it's all the same but at the
[1827.92 - 1832.80] same time it's so different so let's
[1830.40 - 1835.28] talk about that what I mean by that is
[1832.80 - 1838.40] every time you see a flavoring of any
[1835.28 - 1840.04] kind in a product there could be 200
[1838.40 - 1843.08] different ingredients within that
[1840.04 - 1845.72] flavoring 400 ingredients 1,000
[1843.08 - 1848.04] ingredients 100 ingredients it could be
[1845.72 - 1851.48] anything and that's the whole point it's
[1848.04 - 1853.84] like the fragrance world it's a secret
[1851.48 - 1857.40] you don't get to choose or know what is
[1853.84 - 1860.72] inside the product it's like perfume
[1857.40 - 1864.12] perfume fragrance cologne you'll never
[1860.72 - 1866.56] know a thousand ingredients many of them
[1864.12 - 1868.72] toxic sitting inside of it and you don't
[1866.56 - 1871.64] know about it natural flavors is like
[1868.72 - 1873.76] the perfume perfume fragrance world of
[1871.64 - 1875.92] food and you thought you're getting
[1873.76 - 1877.84] transparency full transparency of your
[1875.92 - 1879.88] health food you're in the store you're
[1877.84 - 1882.36] in an organic market you're in a Foods
[1879.88 - 1885.00] Market you see some healthy snacks some
[1882.36 - 1888.36] healthy drinks and little do you know
[1885.00 - 1891.68] you got MSG in your or drink in your
[1888.36 - 1893.80] snack it's in the natural flavor along
[1891.68 - 1896.04] with many other chemicals you don't know
[1893.80 - 1898.36] about that are in the natural flavorings
[1896.04 - 1901.52] now why would natural flavors or natural
[1898.36 - 1904.20] flavoring of any kind have MSG in it if
[1901.52 - 1905.76] you look into MSG you'll see out there
[1904.20 - 1908.32] that it has to be listed in an
[1905.76 - 1910.72] ingredient list on a food product so if
[1908.32 - 1912.96] you want to choose to use MSG to flavor
[1910.72 - 1915.20] your food it has to be listed in the
[1912.96 - 1917.72] ingredient list but what people don't
[1915.20 - 1919.60] realize is there's a workaround for
[1917.72 - 1922.20] example if you're a food company and you
[1919.60 - 1925.28] want to produce a tasty food product and
[1922.20 - 1927.56] you want to buy and purchase isolated
[1925.28 - 1930.44] mono sodium glutamate to make it taste
[1927.56 - 1932.20] good you can you can purchase it and
[1930.44 - 1934.08] then you can add it to your ingredient
[1932.20 - 1937.16] list but you have to have the
[1934.08 - 1939.16] transparency you have to say mono sodium
[1937.16 - 1941.36] glutamate in your food product
[1939.16 - 1943.96] ingredient list but if you're a
[1941.36 - 1945.96] health-minded person and you see it in
[1943.96 - 1948.44] the ingredient list mono sodium
[1945.96 - 1950.88] glutamate you may not choose to purchase
[1948.44 - 1953.56] that product so the workaround comes
[1950.88 - 1956.48] like this the food company can purchase
[1953.56 - 1959.04] natural flavors natural flavors can go
[1956.48 - 1961.84] into the food snack or food product you
[1959.04 - 1964.20] don't have to list monosodium glutamate
[1961.84 - 1966.04] it's in the natural flavors food
[1964.20 - 1968.68] chemists that work for the food chemical
[1966.04 - 1971.16] industry create the natural flavors they
[1968.68 - 1972.72] add the MSG into the natural flavors
[1971.16 - 1974.96] along with a whole bunch of other
[1972.72 - 1977.44] chemicals then they sell those natural
[1974.96 - 1979.68] flavorings to food manufacturer ing
[1977.44 - 1981.64] companies if you have a package of
[1979.68 - 1985.04] snacks that you like and they're a
[1981.64 - 1987.44] healthy package of snacks and GMO free
[1985.04 - 1989.76] the whole bit gluten-free and you see
[1987.44 - 1991.72] natural flavors in there and you call
[1989.76 - 1994.08] the company and say what's in your
[1991.72 - 1994.08] natural
[1995.92 - 2001.20] flavors hello super erer duper healthy
[1998.84 - 2004.36] Sac Delights Incorporated how can I help
[2001.20 - 2006.36] you yeah um anyway I got your package
[2004.36 - 2008.00] right here and I just have a question it
[2006.36 - 2011.92] says natural
[2008.00 - 2013.80] flavoring yeah and it say natural
[2011.92 - 2015.32] flavoring and I'm just want to clear
[2013.80 - 2017.80] this up for a second cuz I'm thinking
[2015.32 - 2021.16] what is that like what's in the natural
[2017.80 - 2023.24] flavoring our snack foods are non- GMO
[2021.16 - 2025.92] they're grain-free they're gluten-free
[2023.24 - 2027.48] and the best there is out there so
[2025.92 - 2031.08] what's your question again
[2027.48 - 2032.68] sir the the natural flavorings is it
[2031.08 - 2034.72] possible something else is in the
[2032.68 - 2038.12] natural flavorings because what is
[2034.72 - 2043.92] natural flavorings do you know
[2038.12 - 2046.52] M hm I think I really don't I can't
[2043.92 - 2048.60] answer that right now I can get back to
[2046.52 - 2051.20] you though what's your phone number the
[2048.60 - 2053.32] thing is no one will ever know no one's
[2051.20 - 2055.56] supposed to know it's not meant for
[2053.32 - 2057.56] anybody to know that's the whole point
[2055.56 - 2060.24] it's a way for the industry to sneak in
[2057.56 - 2062.88] anything they want to sneak in now we're
[2060.24 - 2064.52] highlighting MSG but there's a whole
[2062.88 - 2066.64] bunch of other chemicals getting snuck
[2064.52 - 2069.28] into those natural flavors but there's
[2066.64 - 2071.56] good reason to highlight MSG because
[2069.28 - 2074.12] it's really that bad now there's a lot
[2071.56 - 2076.28] of gaslighting going on about MSG out
[2074.12 - 2078.72] there you'll hear about it it's not so
[2076.28 - 2081.56] bad for us after all there's really no
[2078.72 - 2084.84] harmful effects there's no evidence or
[2081.56 - 2086.40] data there's no proof clinics are even
[2084.84 - 2088.64] saying well there's really no proof that
[2086.40 - 2090.60] MSG has harmed anyone so you can
[2088.64 - 2092.80] actually have it in moderation why not
[2090.60 - 2094.40] no one's really getting hurt by it now
[2092.80 - 2096.92] here's the big one they hang their hat
[2094.40 - 2099.04] on right here they'll say mono sodium
[2096.92 - 2102.96] glutamate is naturally occurring in all
[2099.04 - 2105.48] your Foods Dairy meat fruits vegetables
[2102.96 - 2108.64] and this is where they're totally wrong
[2105.48 - 2111.96] if you have an organic non-GMO cherry
[2108.64 - 2115.24] tomato in your hand they will say that
[2111.96 - 2118.48] there's naturally occurring MSG inside
[2115.24 - 2121.56] that tomato this is not true to begin
[2118.48 - 2124.48] with your cherry tomato is organic it's
[2121.56 - 2127.08] non GMO you have to remember that what
[2124.48 - 2130.56] you'll find in that tomato is naturally
[2127.08 - 2132.92] occurring glutamic acid in traces not
[2130.56 - 2134.48] the mono sodium glutamate additive
[2132.92 - 2136.68] that's used in the industry the thing
[2134.48 - 2140.04] that's added to the food that's isolated
[2136.68 - 2142.64] and synthesized highly concentrated and
[2140.04 - 2145.80] GMO if a supplement product or food
[2142.64 - 2148.20] product says non GMO but has natural
[2145.80 - 2150.12] flavors in the ingredient list and those
[2148.20 - 2152.40] natural flavors are comprised with a lot
[2150.12 - 2156.16] of different chemicals and additives
[2152.40 - 2160.32] that are derived from GMO sources is the
[2156.16 - 2163.40] product now truly non- GMO or because
[2160.32 - 2166.96] the natural flavors has GMO chemicals in
[2163.40 - 2169.48] there it's truly not a non-GMO product
[2166.96 - 2171.48] but in defense of supplement product
[2169.48 - 2174.24] companies and food product companies
[2171.48 - 2176.36] they just don't know no one's telling
[2174.24 - 2180.04] those people who own and run those
[2176.36 - 2183.12] companies that natural flavoring is GMO
[2180.04 - 2185.48] or natural flavoring has a lot of MSG in
[2183.12 - 2189.48] it or natural flavors and natural
[2185.48 - 2192.72] flavoring has 100 200 300 500 different
[2189.48 - 2194.96] chemicals in it if you see a drink or a
[2192.72 - 2197.32] packaged food that has say 10
[2194.96 - 2199.96] ingredients in it and it's wholesome and
[2197.32 - 2202.12] the ingredients look clean and good but
[2199.96 - 2205.64] you see an additional ingredient called
[2202.12 - 2208.12] natural flavorings or natural flavors or
[2205.64 - 2210.28] just plain flavors or raspberry flavor
[2208.12 - 2212.60] vanilla flavor or any kind of flavor
[2210.28 - 2215.20] flavoring then in true reality you're
[2212.60 - 2217.72] not dealing with 10 ingredients you're
[2215.20 - 2220.16] dealing with at least an 11th which is
[2217.72 - 2223.32] MSG but here's the crazy part you're
[2220.16 - 2225.96] really dealing with 100 more or maybe
[2223.32 - 2227.52] 200 more or even more than that could
[2225.96 - 2230.16] even be a thousand no one would ever
[2227.52 - 2232.36] know so really instead of 10 ingredients
[2230.16 - 2234.76] on that package there should be a list a
[2232.36 - 2236.96] mile long on that package names you
[2234.76 - 2238.92] can't even believe and that's the
[2236.96 - 2242.36] workaround and that's how everybody's
[2238.92 - 2244.04] being played as the years go on anything
[2242.36 - 2246.12] could be put into those natural
[2244.04 - 2248.24] flavorings and natural flavors and then
[2246.12 - 2251.08] put into your food no one would ever
[2248.24 - 2254.20] know the MSG of today is different than
[2251.08 - 2256.48] the MSG years ago decades ago and the
[2254.20 - 2260.04] MSG decades ago was different than the
[2256.48 - 2263.28] MSG originally discovered back in 1908
[2260.04 - 2267.68] the MSG now is produced and created out
[2263.28 - 2272.72] of GMO sugar beads GMO corn GMO molasses
[2267.68 - 2276.20] making MSG GMO and then that MSG is
[2272.72 - 2278.48] added to a natural flavor mix whether
[2276.20 - 2280.76] it's or organic natural flavors or
[2278.48 - 2284.68] natural flavorings or vanilla natural
[2280.76 - 2287.16] flavor it's added to that now it's a GMO
[2284.68 - 2290.44] product then those natural flavors get
[2287.16 - 2294.12] put into a package of organic food
[2290.44 - 2297.00] organic food label says n GMO but now it
[2294.12 - 2299.72] is GMO and here's an interesting thing
[2297.00 - 2302.36] MSG isn't just MSG anymore by itself
[2299.72 - 2305.08] sure they derive it from GMO sources
[2302.36 - 2308.24] like the GMO corn GMO sugar beets and
[2305.08 - 2309.84] other GMO products but they also add
[2308.24 - 2312.96] different chemicals to it now so it's
[2309.84 - 2315.16] not just MSG by itself it's MSG with
[2312.96 - 2317.04] other chemicals added to it and it's
[2315.16 - 2319.76] random you won't know what kind of MSG
[2317.04 - 2322.32] you even get some MSG is just plain old
[2319.76 - 2324.64] just sugar beads that are actually GMO
[2322.32 - 2326.44] gmoe corn it's dry from it and you just
[2324.64 - 2329.52] get the MSG mixed into those natural
[2326.44 - 2331.36] flavors and some MSG will have that plus
[2329.52 - 2333.72] chemicals but it's all random and it's
[2331.36 - 2336.88] all bad and then when you think it's bad
[2333.72 - 2339.60] enough there's different forms of MSG
[2336.88 - 2341.84] there's a cloned version where it's all
[2339.60 - 2344.80] synthetic what this means is the
[2341.84 - 2347.96] original was made off of GMO sugar beets
[2344.80 - 2350.56] or GMO molasses GMO corn but chemical
[2347.96 - 2353.92] companies found cheaper ways of doing it
[2350.56 - 2357.40] cloning it cloning the building blocks
[2353.92 - 2360.28] of GMO corn GMO sugar beat versions of
[2357.40 - 2363.96] MSG creating an identical synthetic
[2360.28 - 2367.60] compound and calling it MSG and then
[2363.96 - 2370.24] that sold to food companies and put into
[2367.60 - 2372.56] the natural flavors and then those
[2370.24 - 2375.44] natural flavors get put into your ice
[2372.56 - 2377.88] creams your drinks your snacks your
[2375.44 - 2380.80] cereals your supplements and then little
[2377.88 - 2383.40] juice boxes that your kids drink it was
[2380.80 - 2386.40] the ultimate baat and switch it was an
[2383.40 - 2388.92] invasion natural flavors became an
[2386.40 - 2392.12] invasion into our food supply without
[2388.92 - 2394.40] your consent nobody ever asked you hey
[2392.12 - 2397.20] everybody do you want this crap in your
[2394.40 - 2399.76] food sad thing is you're not even going
[2397.20 - 2401.92] to taste the real flavor of what the
[2399.76 - 2404.24] food was because they added all their
[2401.92 - 2405.56] chemical natural flavors in so if it was
[2404.24 - 2407.48] apple juice you're not going to taste
[2405.56 - 2409.36] the apple juice to the natural way it
[2407.48 - 2411.12] would be you're going to taste their
[2409.36 - 2413.20] concoction they added into the apple
[2411.12 - 2415.24] juice the thing is there's all these
[2413.20 - 2418.64] people out there that pride in how they
[2415.24 - 2421.20] eat they pride in what they avoid too
[2418.64 - 2423.84] like they avoid fast foods or processed
[2421.20 - 2426.96] foods they think they escaped the
[2423.84 - 2429.32] conventional machine but they didn't the
[2426.96 - 2432.40] conventional evil machine still has
[2429.32 - 2435.92] their hands in your Pure Food so let's
[2432.40 - 2438.00] head back to the MSG why is it bad well
[2435.92 - 2440.00] conventional world says right now like
[2438.00 - 2441.80] don't worry about it clinics even say
[2440.00 - 2444.12] hey it's not really causing a problem
[2441.80 - 2446.16] with anybody something not to be alarmed
[2444.12 - 2448.12] about there isn't enough studies we
[2446.16 - 2450.00] don't really see anything we haven't
[2448.12 - 2452.16] seen anybody really get hurt by it so
[2450.00 - 2454.44] maybe you don't have to worry about it
[2452.16 - 2457.04] but how would they know science of
[2454.44 - 2458.64] research doesn't know why anybody sick
[2457.04 - 2461.84] still to this day they don't have the
[2458.64 - 2465.04] technology to know why at the same time
[2461.84 - 2467.56] chronic illness is exploding out there
[2465.04 - 2469.84] especially neurological conditions and
[2467.56 - 2471.48] disorders I'm not saying that all the
[2469.84 - 2474.16] chronic illness of today is because of
[2471.48 - 2476.64] MSG but I am saying they figured out
[2474.16 - 2478.88] years ago decades ago that the MSG was
[2476.64 - 2480.72] bothering people giving them migraines
[2478.88 - 2483.44] making them dizzy giving them
[2480.72 - 2485.56] neurological symptoms and then they
[2483.44 - 2487.68] backtracked they papered it all up
[2485.56 - 2489.96] doesn't exist it's not happening they
[2487.68 - 2492.24] rewrote history like they do all too
[2489.96 - 2494.52] often so let's go back a little ways
[2492.24 - 2497.88] when people first started complaining
[2494.52 - 2501.48] about problems that they identified with
[2497.88 - 2504.60] MSG first of all your doctor could not
[2501.48 - 2506.92] identify why the MSG was causing a
[2504.60 - 2509.32] symptom or a problem they didn't have
[2506.92 - 2511.92] the technology to diagnose it and they
[2509.32 - 2514.00] still don't today which is why they can
[2511.92 - 2515.64] rewrite history right now and tell you
[2514.00 - 2517.04] well we don't know what the effects are
[2515.64 - 2519.24] and we don't think think there is any
[2517.04 - 2521.92] problems MSG really isn't an issue like
[2519.24 - 2525.36] we maybe thought before but let's talk
[2521.92 - 2529.52] about the truth to begin with MSG isn't
[2525.36 - 2532.20] the cause of somebody having OCD bipolar
[2529.52 - 2535.28] depression anxiety but it can help
[2532.20 - 2537.88] worsen it and MSG is not the cause of
[2535.28 - 2540.32] severe migraines or the cause of other
[2537.88 - 2542.92] symptoms and conditions that are severe
[2540.32 - 2545.40] but it can worsen the symptoms here's
[2542.92 - 2548.84] why MSG could be a problem it can build
[2545.40 - 2551.88] up inside the brain over time deposits
[2548.84 - 2554.88] of MSG can build up around neurons
[2551.88 - 2557.52] dampening electrical impulses neurons in
[2554.88 - 2559.80] neurotransmitter activity so if anybody
[2557.52 - 2562.76] has a problem like toxic heavy metals in
[2559.80 - 2565.04] their brain or lowgrade viral infections
[2562.76 - 2567.72] or high-grade viral infections chronic
[2565.04 - 2569.52] illness autoimmune there already is a
[2567.72 - 2571.44] compromise going on between the
[2569.52 - 2573.44] pathogens the metals and toxins
[2571.44 - 2575.60] somebody's dealing with or brain
[2573.44 - 2578.60] inflammation that somebody is dealing
[2575.60 - 2580.92] with MSG can be the straw that breaks
[2578.60 - 2584.64] the Campbell's back all these problems
[2580.92 - 2587.16] are happening MSG deposits are building
[2584.64 - 2589.64] we have more issues now with the brain
[2587.16 - 2591.52] this way if somebody's already sensitive
[2589.64 - 2592.84] from metals and pathogens and other
[2591.52 - 2595.64] issues then they're going to be
[2592.84 - 2597.60] sensitive to the MSG if someone doesn't
[2595.64 - 2599.92] have any big health problems they don't
[2597.60 - 2602.44] have any symptoms or conditions yet and
[2599.92 - 2605.28] they go through life ingesting a lot of
[2602.44 - 2608.04] MSG along the way it keeps building up
[2605.28 - 2610.20] over time and eventually the MSG
[2608.04 - 2613.36] deposits that build up on the neurons
[2610.20 - 2616.84] become a weakness I talk in great detail
[2613.36 - 2616.84] about this in the brains saver
[2617.08 - 2623.92] books H my favorite snack bars let me
[2621.40 - 2626.44] see this what flavors do they
[2623.92 - 2630.32] have ooh strawberry and
[2626.44 - 2631.44] almond o raspberry and macadamia nut let
[2630.32 - 2634.72] me read the
[2631.44 - 2637.64] back what's this natural flavors thing
[2634.72 - 2641.00] oh that's right right I remember that
[2637.64 - 2645.48] stuff's bad putting this
[2641.00 - 2649.36] back the word natural isn't safe space
[2645.48 - 2652.60] anymore it never was the lines are
[2649.36 - 2656.36] blurred always have been there is
[2652.60 - 2659.24] treachery in the stores natural can mean
[2656.36 - 2662.68] anything at this point in the world not
[2659.24 - 2664.32] even good old non GMO is sketched in
[2662.68 - 2667.48] stone nor
[2664.32 - 2669.36] secure what we see with our own eyes
[2667.48 - 2671.88] isn't all that's cracked up to being
[2669.36 - 2675.28] known and what we can't see with our
[2671.88 - 2677.56] eyes is in a leag of its own words can
[2675.28 - 2680.36] have different meanings when it comes
[2677.56 - 2682.96] down to our health there's a lot of bad
[2680.36 - 2686.60] still out there in our way when it comes
[2682.96 - 2688.84] to healing and who knows it's still so
[2686.60 - 2691.80] confusing and sad when you think about
[2688.84 - 2694.72] the tricks in games played on the ones
[2691.80 - 2698.04] by the bad who take care of their health
[2694.72 - 2700.20] the most but they've been had and as we
[2698.04 - 2703.16] walk down the food aisles filling our
[2700.20 - 2706.36] baskets with wholesome options and have
[2703.16 - 2709.00] no idea why corruption somehow found its
[2706.36 - 2712.32] way into the door of the natural and
[2709.00 - 2714.72] even organic food stores how strange it
[2712.32 - 2717.68] all really is that the back of the
[2714.72 - 2720.28] bottle or package has a mysterious word
[2717.68 - 2723.84] puzzle that most everyone
[2720.28 - 2726.52] ignores sometimes it's even on the lid
[2723.84 - 2729.12] it's time we become aware about the
[2726.52 - 2733.40] flavors that make the food tastes less
[2729.12 - 2735.64] Bland and so bizarre so many pride in
[2733.40 - 2738.08] themselves when it comes to taking care
[2735.64 - 2741.00] of their health and they think about
[2738.08 - 2743.24] everything that enters their mouth
[2741.00 - 2746.28] because they're all told health is
[2743.24 - 2748.68] wealth at the same time something is
[2746.28 - 2751.80] hidden and completely stealth
[2748.68 - 2754.24] interfering with your self-care and your
[2751.80 - 2757.04] self-help when it comes to these small
[2754.24 - 2760.60] little words hiding deep within the
[2757.04 - 2765.88] labels we seem to trust the ones that
[2760.60 - 2765.88] control our taste buds and tell us
[2767.76 - 2770.96] [Music]
[2784.80 - 2787.80] Fables
