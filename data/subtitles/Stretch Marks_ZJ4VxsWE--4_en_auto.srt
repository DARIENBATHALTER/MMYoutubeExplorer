1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,120
a lot of people are upset by stretch

2
00:00:01,719 --> 00:00:07,439
marks they feel that they feel upset

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,400
they feel like betrayed they work so

4
00:00:07,439 --> 00:00:10,840
hard to lose their weight they work

5
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,799
really hard and then they have the

6
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:15,080
stretch marks and they're like wow I did

7
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:17,520
all this work I got rid of some excess

8
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:19,600
unwanted pounds and now I'm dealing with

9
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,800
stretch marks reason for those stretch

10
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,599
marks obviously is because you're

11
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:26,560
expanding right when you gain weight we

12
00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:29,560
expand so then we get more more tissue

13
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:32,759
growth if someone gains a few pounds or

14
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:34,680
10 lb 15 or 20 lb and they lose the

15
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:36,840
weight some people their stretch marks

16
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:39,800
are a lot worse than some other people

17
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,879
the reason for that is the very base The

18
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:44,600
Landmark I'm talking about that we want

19
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:47,160
to protect and we want to support that

20
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:49,399
very landmark and base it's deficient

21
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,640
and it's saturated and soaked up with

22
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:53,320
toxins and free radicals that have been

23
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:55,920
there for years and it's deficient of

24
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:58,000
things that it needs so that sponge got

25
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,399
oversaturated with too much poisons

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,680
fight ORF flight too many toxins right

27
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,800
here at the base right here at the

28
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,920
bottom too much adrenaline and it got

29
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,000
damaged and when that base that bottom

30
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,439
of that Derma gets damaged we don't it

31
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,240
doesn't bounce back easy a staticity is

32
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:16,360
gone collagen weakens we lose Vitality

33
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,840
in the bottom of our Derma that's where

34
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,880
it starts to really disappear and if

35
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,479
you're dealing with somebody with a

36
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,040
stagnant sluggish liver which is a big

37
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:25,320
part of it all cuz that's saturated with

38
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,360
toxins and poisons it doesn't help in

39
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,920
fact that's a big deal on its own some

40
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,759
people might have a really toxic liver

41
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,000
because they're so toxic that the Derma

42
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,880
got filled up with a lot more toxins and

43
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
saturated with a lot more adrenaline and

44
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:41,880
then when they lost the weight thees the

45
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,320
elasticity is actually gone they don't

46
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:47,680
have that play that room to play anymore

47
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:49,960
it doesn't Revitalize easy it doesn't

48
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,040
bounce back quick at all and then we

49
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:55,560
have the stretch mark when it comes down

50
00:01:52,040 --> 00:02:00,360
to skin repair and has to start from

51
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:03,200
deep down into the Derma it has to be

52
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:06,079
down deep we got to go low you want to

53
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,960
work on skin and keep skin good you

54
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:10,360
don't want stretch marks taking over

55
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:12,720
when you gain weight and then you lose

56
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:15,800
the weight and you lost all the L right

57
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:18,680
elasticity of the skin and you got the

58
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:22,360
skin is is way too

59
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:24,239
played and it's not bouncing back and

60
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,560
everybody's trying to get the tummy tuck

61
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,920
and they're trying to get all the

62
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,879
different surgeries and Tucks their skin

63
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,680
won't work with them or maybe you just

64
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:33,160
gained a little bit of weight and then

65
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,120
you got the stretch marks from a little

66
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:38,080
bit of

67
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:40,280
weight the way we have to address all of

68
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:43,040
this is always remember no matter what

69
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:47,080
that when we're addressing skin it has

70
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:52,959
to be from the bottom up it has to be

71
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:54,400
from the ground up so from the ground up

72
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:58,760
it can't be

73
00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:03,200
surface it can't even be follicle

74
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:05,400
level it has to be right at the base

75
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:09,360
which is what I call the foundation of

76
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:13,840
your skin deep within the Derma and

77
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:17,360
right under the Derma right under the

78
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,519
skin it's all about immune power it's

79
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,560
all about immune system our immune

80
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:24,480
system patrols that area our immune

81
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:28,000
system needs

82
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:30,480
antioxidants in that area antioxidants

83
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,760
are one of the critical

84
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,000
Builders right there by the way you guys

85
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:38,599
know I work with vimergy this is the

86
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:42,480
vimergy micro immune power with the

87
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:47,040
organic bamboo silica this is the

88
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:49,159
vimergy MSM with the bamboo silica we're

89
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:52,840
going to be joining these two we're

90
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:55,840
going to be putting these two together

91
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:58,920
and vimergy is going to give anyone

92
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:02,519
who's actually getting this a free lemon

93
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:05,799
balm and 5% off of the MSM on top of it

94
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:08,879
so what I love about the Skin Potion

95
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:12,480
what I'm showing you is immune system

96
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,480
and then building blocks for

97
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,280
skin
