but the brain meditation is next and

38
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,799
i have to give you a forewarning though

39
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,840
on this okay with the brain meditation

40
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:19,520
this is really intense in a good way

41
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,759
but it's really intense because once you

42
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,400
do it something's going to

43
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,200
change so when you do the brain

44
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,080
meditation

45
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,960
something is going to change because

46
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,240
it's about

47
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:34,079
ridding fear out of the soul so what

48
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,560
happens when we go through life

49
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,360
we get broken relationships broken

50
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,520
friendships

51
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,799
we get you know betrayal happens in our

52
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,840
life people

53
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:46,799
cheat on us they friendships you know

54
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,479
uh they they fall apart things happen we

55
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,280
go through emotional struggles emotional

56
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:54,320
hardships we get broken trust over it

57
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,399
we feel guilt and shame we get fearful

58
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,560
we get anxiety over depression all these

59
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:02,159
different things depersonalization

60
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,040
and what happens is this builds up in

61
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,119
our soul

62
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,799
and builds up in our soul and builds up

63
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:09,360
in our soul over time

64
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,640
and a lot of fear builds up the brain

65
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,160
meditation

66
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,480
and this is from spirit of compassion

67
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,080
this brain meditation is a powerful

68
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,720
powerful way to rid

69
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,800
that fear but here's how it works though

70
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,080
this is not a man-made meditation so

71
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,040
that's one thing right there

72
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,560
that's so important it's not man-made it

73
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,840
it's a meditation i haven't shared with

74
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,000
you guys yet because i've shared

75
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,360
meditations with you guys before right

76
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,160
you know the medical medium books

77
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,680
there's meditations in there and

78
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,680
and what i've done you know lectures

79
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,400
years ago i would share meditations

80
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,840
there too

81
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,760
from medical you know medical media

82
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,840
meditations it was from spirit of

83
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,760
compassion but this one

84
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,840
i haven't shared yet so this is a

85
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,560
special surprise so

86
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,840
um but prepare yourself find a quiet

87
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,720
spot

88
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,480
and settle in with a quiet spot it's a

89
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,680
short meditation so it's not super

90
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:03,200
long but it's powerful

91
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:05,280
very powerful it's it's a chiller

92
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,120
actually so it's a chiller so i'm

93
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,760
preparing you on that level because in

94
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,959
order

95
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:14,400
to rid fear from the soul something

96
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:16,640
actually has to happen and

97
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,640
because meditations meditations you have

98
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,760
to kind of like keep on doing them over

99
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,120
and over and over again in hopes that

100
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,760
you can get some relief and feel good

101
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,400
from them

102
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,360
and all this this is different this is

103
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,159
about actually

104
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,040
fixing something so this is actually

105
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,560
about

106
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,159
moving something forward and

107
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,080
accomplishing and fixing something

108
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:35,840

109
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,080

this brain meditation here's what

224
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:09,759
happens

225
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:11,680
we start getting out of body with ptsd

226
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,960
experiences we have in our life we start

227
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,680
disconnecting

228
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,960
so our soul because we all have a soul

229
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,360
all unique

230
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,880
so that's what makes us different right

231
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,800
there our souls right

232
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,639
what happens is it gets kind of tattered

233
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,759
along the way it gets kind of beaten

234
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,440
along the way

235
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,199
kind of kind of a little beat up and tat

236
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,680
and worn and tattered

237
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,639
by all these experiences we go through

238
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,919
life

239
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,960
divorces breakups friendships that go

240
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:40,160
wrong

241
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,919
um you know betrayal you know all these

242
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,240
different things that happen in our life

243
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:47,199
with relationships with other people

244
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,840
with you know with uh careers anything

245
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,479
that could

246
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,520
happen any kind of struggles losses oh

247
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:53,840
my god

248
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,000
terrible losses people people suffer

249
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,160
from ptsd because of it

250
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,360
and what happens is our soul starts to

251
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,479
kind of

252
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:05,039
kind of separate because separate from

253
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:07,440
our physical brain from our physical

254
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:09,599
body because it's just too much because

255
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,319
it's trying to get protected because

256
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,240
it's getting

257
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,160
injured it could get fractured by all

258
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,000
these experiences along the way and i've

259
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,319
talked about this over the years but

260
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,639
this is a meditation that spirit of

261
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:23,599
compassion taught me when i was younger

262
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,039
and i've um and i've shared it with

263
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,560
family i've shared it with

264
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:28,319
friends throughout the years to help

265
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,840
them rid fear

266
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:33,839
so that a connection is made again and

267
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,680
we don't know we get this disconnection

268
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,800
you guys we don't know

269
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:40,479
that we get this disconnection and you

270
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,240
will experience

271
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:45,040
when you do this brain meditation

272
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,279
something that i'm just preparing you

273
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:49,279
it's a chiller and i'm saying that

274
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:52,320
because it is because when you

275
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:54,560
start making that connection and fear is

276
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,000
leaving you as your soul is connecting

277
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,279
to your brain your physical brain and

278
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,080
body

279
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:01,760
you feel it it something changes you're

280
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,680
changed afterwards and then if you keep

281
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,920

and um i got a smile on my face on this

340
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,240
one because

341
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,920
this one's really close to me like dear

342
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,360
to me this brain meditation

343
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,920
a spirit of compassion has taught me

344
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,959
since i was a child and

345
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,839
and you can have anyone do this and

346
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,760
there was a question

347
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,600
earlier that came my way was can

348
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,040
children do it absolutely of course they

349
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,320
can do this meditation

350
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:18,320
and and but it's it's

351
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:22,720
really really healing on a soul

352
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:25,120
level of ridding fear is what it does

353
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,240
it's a little bit of a chiller though

354
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,680
i'm just being

355
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,360
frankly i'm just being straight out

356
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:32,800
about that so pre

357
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:36,480
so get you know get in a comfy spot

358
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:39,680
prepare yourself and get ready

359
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,279
because when you make that

360
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,760
soul connection back to the physical

361
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:46,560
body all the way

362
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,760
when you do this and fear just leaves

363
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,480
it's an experience

364
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,959
it really is so i just wanna i just

365
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,000

it's only going to help people it has to

469
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,800
these episodes have to get around share

470
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:18,079
and tell them to listen on apple podcast

471
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,880
um can't wait to hear the brain

472
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:21,279
meditation lisa i'm really excited about

473
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,320
this

474
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:25,040
okay because what happens is when we go

475
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,680
through life

476
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,360
we we get hurt along the way even on a

477
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,759
little little levels and it creates

478
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,639
little

479
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:33,839
little specks of fear inside our soul

480
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,040
because then we're like wait a minute i

481
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,600
don't trust that

482
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,160
wait a minute i don't trust this wait a

483
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,680
minute

484
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:42,000
i don't know if i should do this or make

485
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:44,399
this decision this decision in life

486
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,920
i don't know if i should do this and so

487
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,880
fear can start to just

488
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,920
dominate and dominate in our lives and

489
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,240
over time

490
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:54,240
and what happens with this meditation

491
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:57,600
this brain meditation is

492
00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:00,399
is it reconnects

493
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,839
the the soul and the physical brain

494
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:04,639
because they start

495
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:06,399
to separate which is that out of body

496
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:08,800
thing that goes on that we just start

497
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:12,160
like because life is so hard

498
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:15,440
and it reconnects and then fear just

499
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:17,360
starts to leave and it's really powerful

500
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,279
i can't wait for you guys to try this

501
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,320
and tell other people tell every people

502
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:22,880

everything michelle says i feel this is

681
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,760
going to be a game changer for me

682
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,679
always feel disconnected from the

683
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:18,720
traumas and emotions michelle

684
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:20,400
really really good good point

685
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,080
for me to talk about for a minute that's

686
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,799
so important thank you for

687
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:26,480
thank you for saying that because what

688
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:28,320
happens is we have that we have the

689
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,559
broken friendships and relationships and

690
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:32,320
the betrayal and the hardships and the

691
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:35,520
losses and all kind even

692
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:37,039
on the most mildest way to even extreme

693
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,200
then what happens is we kind of get out

694
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:40,880
of body we get disconnected no one knows

695
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,440
what that is and what that is is the

696
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,039
soul

697
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,039
getting disconnected to the physical

698
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:48,400
brain the neurons in the brain

699
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:51,039
and this meditation brings things back

700
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,240
it makes the connection that's why this

701
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:53,919
is so powerful

702
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,600
share it with others that you think are

703
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:57,120
hurt or just any

704
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,480
even if they're not they don't seem like

705
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,600
they're hurt they still have fear in

706
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,919
there deep inside

707
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:04,080
ashley says subscribe to his newsletter

it's that powerful and that healing

715
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,159
now i have meditations in medical medium

716
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,760
books i've

717
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:30,000
talked about medical media meditations

718
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,960
over the years this one i've been saving

719
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,919
for a long time

720
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,880
and now it's time to actually release

721
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:38,320
this

722
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:40,880
repeat this meditation and it compiles

723
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:42,799
it makes it even stronger and stronger

724
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:45,520
as time goes on you heal more

725
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:47,360
you rid more fear and you heal the soul

726
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:49,919
more and more so you read more fear

727
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,400
and you heal the soul more and more so

728
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:52,640

other places this is uncensored that's

752
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,159
why i keep on saying

753
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,919
it's the uncensored medical medium

754
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:37,039
podcast for reasons you might be used to

755
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:39,279
hearing the podcast

756
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:40,799
on another platform and like where the

757
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:42,640
old radio shows were and you're telling

758
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:43,039
other people about that but that's not

759
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,039
help

760
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:46,960

god bless you guys too um

794
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:03,200
i'm really really okay rosanna

795
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,640
so it's hard for me to meditate mind

796
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,600
wanders all over the place

797
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,799
yes it's meditations out there are hard

798
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,559
they're man-made

799
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:12,559
and man-made meditations are different

800
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:13,600
than this this is not a man-made

801
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:16,480
meditation

802
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,600
this is a meditation that's easy to do

803
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,440
but more powerful

804
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,960
than man-made meditations this

805
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,400
meditation comes from above

806
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,000
since i was child i was taught this

807
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:27,039
meditation from from

808
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:30,240
spirit of compassion and it's easy

809
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:33,279
to do but mind-blowing

810
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:35,919
and mind-healing it's a chiller

811
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:39,840
i say that because it is it's a chiller

812
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:39,840

841
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:44,880
danielle good question will the

842
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:48,480
meditation heal in layers

843
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,919
the more that we do yes the first time

844
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:53,520
you do it

845
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:56,799
powerful you keep on doing it powerful

846
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:57,600
you keep on doing it powerful and more

847
00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:00,799
powerful

848
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:01,440
and it literally becomes a part of your

849
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:04,799
soul

850
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:09,039
to get rid of the fear and it becomes

851
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:11,120
this anchor so that your soul

852
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:12,399
stays with your physical brain and body

853
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,799
because when we get hurt

854
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:16,320
when someone cheats on us boom our soul

855
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:17,440
just gets knocked out of us for a moment

856
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,760
we're out of body

857
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,960
when we lose a loved one boom our soul

858
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,399
gets knocked out of us for a little

859
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:26,159
while we're out of body

860
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:28,240
when we get hurt by someone boom

861
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:29,279
when we have a divorce boom when we have

862
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:32,720
a uh

863
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:35,679
some kind of confrontation boom our soul

864
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:37,520
goes out of body and it kind of hovers

865
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:40,399
around us a little bit

866
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,799
and we start getting disconnected and

867
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:42,799
and

868
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:44,000
when you do the meditation you're

869
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:45,520
bringing your soul closer

870
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,200
to your to your neurons you're

871
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:49,520
connecting the physical part of your

872
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,440
body with your soul everybody has a soul

873
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:53,919
that's that's what that's what we are

874
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:56,000
we're a soul inside a physical body

875
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:59,120
and so it's connecting it and healing it

876
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:01,039
it's ridding fear to bring the soul back

877
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,399
this isn't out there anywhere it doesn't

878
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,760
exist out there and finally i'm like

879
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:05,440
look i get it there's man-made

880
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,880
meditations out there people are trying

881
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:10,320
to do stuff out there

882
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:13,840
but it's time it's time i bring this

883
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:14,799
anchor in so people get grounded and get

884
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,440
that fear out

885
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:19,440
and heal the soul it's time i was really

886
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:22,159

can't guarantee that it'll

910
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,720
most likely be censored i'm hearing that

911
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,159
now

912
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,399
platforms that people have listened to

913
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:13,120
my old radio shows on they're they're on

914
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:15,039
these new episodes just because they

915
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:17,279
might be on these other platforms

916
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:18,320
they're censored and so apple podcast is

917
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:20,480
the official

918
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:21,679
launch pad you're looking for it sally

919
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,120
says you're looking forward to listening

920
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:25,039
thank you i'm can't wait for you to

921
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:27,840
listen i can't wait

922
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:29,840
um hi naturally i don't meditate

923
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:32,159
hopefully this will get me into it

924
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:33,440
um once you do this meditation you're

925
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:34,480
not going to want to do any other ones

926
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,919
out there

927
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,760
because when you go back to the other

928
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:40,000
ones even though you haven't

929
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:41,520
you know you're saying you don't do them

930
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,880
this is just for people who

931
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:45,279
do meditations you're going to be like

932
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,720
okay wait a minute i see the difference

933
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:48,640
i see that this is a whole different

934
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,840
thing because my family i have friends

935
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,679
they meditate they try different

936
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:54,080

jen um this brain meditation

1049
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:43,520
every day do it once a day i like it

1050
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,960
twice a day morning and night i'd

1051
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,760
recommend it to friends and family that

1052
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,280
have

1053
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,879
things have happened in their life that

1054
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:51,200
have stayed with them

1055
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:52,639
and post-traumatic stress syndrome and

1056
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:54,320
everything and i've recommended this

1057
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:55,440
meditation twice a day because it's

1058
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:58,960
short

1059
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:02,000
short and powerful and not hard to

1060
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:05,280
do you find a quiet spot you kick

1061
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,160
back you lay down and you close your

1062
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:09,680
eyes

1063
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:12,800
and you listen and you do it twice a day

1064
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:16,160
and it really

1065
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:19,040
really helps connect

1066
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:20,960
that divide that occurs from when we get

1067
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,760
hurt that divide and then fear here's

1068
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,160
what happens

1069
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,520
as a soul as we get hurt through life we

1070
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:29,119
get that we get betrayed

1071
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:30,800
our soul leaves our body a little bit

1072
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:34,000
and then what fills in in between is

1073
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:36,320
fear so fear fills in the gap

1074
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,359
so the soul starts leaving a little fear

1075
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,880
fills in the gap

1076
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:41,920
fear fills in the gap soul starts

1077
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:44,320
leaving more and more fear fills the gap

1078
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:45,839
and now we're fearful when we don't even

1079
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,040
think we're supposed to or not and we

1080
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:49,280
have it in the way even if we're not

1081
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:52,160
feeling it in the moment it's there

1082
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:53,680
and this brings the soul back rids fear

1083
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:55,440
brings the soul back more rid sphere

1084
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:57,200
brings the soul back ritz fear

1085
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,960
and brings it back and then you do it

1086
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:01,440

do it once a day try to do it twice a

1181
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:12,079
day i recommend the family and friends

1182
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,079
that have had hardships and struggles

1183
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:15,760
and fear and worry and concern

1184
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:17,440
and they've had breakups and divorces

1185
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:20,720
and relationship issues or

1186
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:23,200
just different emotional challenges and

1187
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:24,800
what happens is your soul just slowly

1188
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:26,720
leaves the body a little bit

1189
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,079
so slowly leaves the body and fear fills

1190
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:30,640
in the center and fills in the center

1191
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:33,599
and it just starts to divide and

1192
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:34,320
this brain meditation it brings the soul

1193
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:36,560

fills in the gap

1422
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:37,680
and our soul just gets knocked out of us

00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:39,040
from these

1424
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:41,200

hardships with

chronic illness like lyme and we go

00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:10,720
in neurological symptoms that also puts

1526
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:13,200
fear in us

1527
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:14,880

1528
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:16,480
critical if you got

1529
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:19,040
symptoms and conditions you're battling

1530
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:20,480
