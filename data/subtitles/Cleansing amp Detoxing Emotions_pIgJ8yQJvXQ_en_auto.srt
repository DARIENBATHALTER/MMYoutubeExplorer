1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,540
before I start talking about cleansing

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:09,599
and emotions what happens when we're

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:12,660
cleansing cleansing out toxins and

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,099
poisons out of our bloodstream out of

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:16,320
our organs

6
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:18,600
and all that poison and all that toxin

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,939
comes out how it can trigger us

8
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,279
emotionally how we can feel things

9
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:25,619

10
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,539

serious I want to just talk about that

81
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,580
but I do want to cover some cleansing I

82
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:22,200
want to talk about that I don't know if

83
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:24,959
you have this book I'm just reading a

84
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:27,360
little bit of about that here

85
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:30,019
all right

86
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,019
so

87
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:36,599
Heather says so do we pick out our own

88
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:38,700
Stones ahead of time

89
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:40,620
I would pick them out tomorrow on the

90
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:43,260
first day of the collecting Stones

91
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:44,819
meditation Journey you can pick them out

92
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:47,340
before tomorrow you can pick them out

93
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:50,280
today you can pick them out yesterday

94
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:51,959
if you have to if you have no choice and

95
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,299
you're available like you're available

96
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:57,420
to do it like you have the option you

97
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:59,519
have the the time whatever you can do

98
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:01,080
that but tomorrow is the best day for it

99
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,840
but I understand if you had to do it

100
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:05,640
earlier you had to do it today

101
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:09,000
everybody has a different set of

102
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:11,220
experiences the Betrayal one person went

103
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,680
through might have been substantially

104
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:16,620
different from someone else's

105
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:19,560
not everybody's betrayal is the same not

106
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:22,079
everybody's pain suffering and

107
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,919
experience from being betrayed is the

108
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,040
same

109
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:28,080
everyone is different

110
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:30,120
the Betrayal that you may have had in

111
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,639
your life is different than what someone

112
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:35,759
else has gone through

113
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:38,280
keep that in mind it's so important and

114
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:41,580
yet maybe the negative impact it had on

115
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:44,699
their lives could in some sense be equal

116
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:46,860
someone could be betrayed

117
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:49,020
in one way

118
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:51,419
and somebody else can be betrayed in

119
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:53,580
another way

120
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:55,139
they won't seem equal when you hear

121
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:57,540
about the Betrayal

122
00:04:55,139 --> 00:05:01,620
but yet it could affect us equally like

123
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:04,740
we can still feel that experience I you

124
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:06,540
let me down you broke my trust you

125
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:10,400
betrayed me

126
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:10,400
you stabbed me in the back

127
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:15,780
sometimes people experience much more

128
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:18,780
hardship more losses a lot of people

129
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:21,120
experience hardship on planet mess

130
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:23,220
more breakups as they look for love in

131
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,139
their life how many people have

132
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:28,100
experienced a lot of breakups a lot of

133
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:32,160
relationship issues divorces

134
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:34,139
relationship breakups separations

135
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,000
so many people go through that and

136
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:38,639
they're hurt and it builds up and it

137
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,740
gets stored up inside

138
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,479
hence why it's so important to do the

139
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:44,880
collecting Stones meditation journey to

140
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:46,979
pull that stuff out so it's not sitting

141
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,440
in there and it's not festering and it's

142
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:52,139
not in there and it's not rotting and

143
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:55,680
festering because our hurt can actually

144
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:56,520
sit in ourselves and just fester in

145
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,620
there

146
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:01,520
and so we want to get that drawn out

147
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:01,520
like a Venom

148
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:07,500
business relationships that are hurtful

149
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:10,139
rather than fruitful so many people

150
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:11,940
partner up with people going to Biz with

151
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:14,639
people try to start something with

152
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:16,800
people and instead of it being fruitful

153
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:19,440
it becomes hurtful

154
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:22,500
and as people find their way find their

155
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,419
true calling they crawl out of the

156
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:27,000
depths of a hardship they thought was

157
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:29,460
their fault and in reality was the

158
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,860
depths of Darkness

159
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:34,560
some people see Darkness for what it is

160
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:37,319
and many don't

161
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,840
many people choose to kind of like

162
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:41,580
put the blinders on they don't want to

163
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,580
see the darkness

164
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:47,220
they kind of just don't want to admit or

165
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:49,259
have the realization that

166
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:52,620
there was something dark going on there

167
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:54,600
with that person or however and they

168
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:56,520
just don't really see it so they don't

169
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,860
they put the blinders on they don't want

170
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:01,759
to drop the blinders they don't want to

171
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,759
be able to see

172
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:06,900
they have different ways of handling

173
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:08,759
difficult memories and experiences

174
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:10,979
that's a whole other difference between

175
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:14,460
so many people

176
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:18,680
so many have difficult

177
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:18,680
way they have difficult experiences

178
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:24,599
Korean says what book are you reading

179
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,759

all time in health

183
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:37,560
millions of these books got around the

184
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:39,840
world and have changed people's lives in

185
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:42,060
such a way like getting like getting

186
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:45,479
them out of the darkest situations with

187
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:47,340
their health pulling them out of hell

188
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:50,039
that they were in and suffering and

189
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:53,180
struggling and taking them into such a

190
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:53,180
great place of healing

191
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:00,620
the information in this book is just so

192
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:00,620
powerful by the way

193
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:05,580
so this is a really

194
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:07,860
powerful piece of information I'm

195
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:09,780
reading right here

196
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:11,699
so many people have different ways of

197
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:13,979
handling difficult memories and

198
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:16,440
experiences

199
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:17,940
we have a glitch I see on IG it looks

200
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,740
like the connection is just going and

201
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:22,020
going and going

202
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:24,180
but so many people

203
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:27,900
they handle memories and experiences

204
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:31,259
differently some people just wall It Off

205
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:33,180
it's like a mechanism that occurs where

206
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:35,880
they can wall it off they can put a wall

207
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:37,320
up some people are in in a place where

208
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:39,539
there's so much PTSD and they're

209
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,919
struggling so much they can't put that

210
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:44,339
wall up

211
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:46,740
it's not possible for them

212
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:49,920
there's they feel so vulnerable they

213
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:51,120
feel so exposed with that experience and

214
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,820
that memory

215
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:56,040
Walling off Walling it off becomes very

216
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:58,920
difficult and they're trapped in the

217
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:01,160
PTSD of whatever that experience was or

218
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,160
is

219
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,839
they have different different ways of

220
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:09,240
handling hardships memories and

221
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:11,399
experiences releasing as much as they

222
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:13,260
safely can while some memories become

223
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:15,360
buried in the subconscious so this is

224
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:18,600
what happens with people you go through

225
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:21,720
an experience you move forward

226
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:23,339
and it's buried in the subconsciousness

227
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,500
that hardship

228
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:27,120
that hard time that struggle something

229
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:29,399
they went through

230
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:32,839
it's now buried

231
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:32,839
in their subconsciousness

232
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,839
well we're all different our experiences

233
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,640
there is still a Sisterhood and

234
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:40,260
Brotherhood to what we go through in

235
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,959
this life so even though we all have

236
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:46,440
different experiences

237
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:48,899
some of us can bury it into our

238
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:51,420
move forward some of us are trapped in

239
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:54,180
the PTSD in in the moment and just can't

240
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:58,320
seem to shake it can't seem to push it

241
00:09:54,180 --> 00:10:00,180
off anywhere but regardless We're All in

242
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,660
This Brotherhood and Sisterhood as we go

243
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,660
through life

244
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,760
if you're having problems on IG head to

245
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:07,760
Telegram

246
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:12,420
the chronically you'll often find power

247
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,640
in numbers when they connect over their

248
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:16,200
shared suffering and that's the thing

249
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,760
the chronically ill have been swept

250
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:20,779
under the carpet they've been beaten

251
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,779
down through the generations

252
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:26,220
they've been treated like lepers even in

253
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:27,660
the world of health and wellness and

254
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:29,220
what you'll notice now with chronic

255
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:31,080
illness

256
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:33,600
is that chronic illness is getting some

257
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:36,360
more respect the medical medium books

258
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:39,440
the last decade of putting information

259
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:42,240
out there for the chronically ill

260
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:44,160
information that's been life-saving and

261
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,320
moving them forward and validating the

262
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,600
real symptoms and conditions has changed

263
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,399
and shaped the health and wellness world

264
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:53,760
right now

265
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:55,260
where now it's becoming a little trendy

266
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:58,079
for people in the health and wellness

267
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:59,700
and influencers to acknowledge the

268
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,620
chronically ill a little bit even if

269
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:04,279
they don't understand

270
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:04,279
or know

271
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,279
the one thing about doing going live

272
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:31,700
when it happens and you can't avoid

273
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:31,700
anything else but I think we're here

274
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,240
so the chronically you'll often find

275
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:39,260
power in numbers when they connect over

276
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,260
they're shared

277
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,700
we're having a tech problem

278
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,459
check one two

279
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:07,459
this is when you're not live you can be

280
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:07,459
like let's edit this out

281
00:12:12,019 --> 00:12:16,920
even if some of these physical symptoms

282
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:19,079
vary with one person experience

283
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,940
migraines anxiety or depression in

284
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:25,519
another person going through back pain

285
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:25,519
and neck pain or insomnia

286
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:32,459
everybody who's chronically sick who's

287
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:34,680
really suffered and struggled and

288
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:36,120
understands what it's like to go through

289
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:39,120
what they're going through

290
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:41,160
can relate to another person who's going

291
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,980
through it

292
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:46,139
that's what's incredible about

293
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:47,880
the chronically ill about people who

294
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:49,139
have struggled and suffered and been

295
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:52,139
through a lot

296
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:54,360
they can relate

297
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:55,920
to someone else who's struggling and

298
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:58,500
suffering and I think that's what makes

299
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:01,260
the medical meme community so powerful

300
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:03,540
and that's what people don't understand

301
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:06,000
out there

302
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:08,579
including the haters and the critics and

303
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,620
stuff like that they don't know why

304
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:12,779
there's such a strong bond in the

305
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:14,279
medical medium Community with people who

306
00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:16,019
care about each other

307
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:17,940
because when they've been through

308
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:19,680
something

309
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:21,540
they

310
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:24,060
understand

311
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:26,399
and they recognize that someone else

312
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:28,860
could be going through the same

313
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:32,339
someone else

314
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:34,680
could be going through something similar

315
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:38,060
and it's this connection

316
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:38,060
it's really powerful

317
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:46,100
it's being able to understand what the

318
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:46,100
other person is going through

319
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:52,740
we've all experienced relationships

320
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:54,779
whether with friends family members

321
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:58,019
spouses or others that became difficult

322
00:13:54,779 --> 00:14:00,720
or even harmful in some way many of us

323
00:13:58,019 --> 00:14:03,180
have had experience physical injury that

324
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,920
went along with emotional injury we've

325
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:07,260
all been let down

326
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:10,079
either way physically or emotionally

327
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:11,760
even when the details are different we

328
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:13,860
can find enough similarities to one

329
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,720
another's hurt to identify with each

330
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:18,540
other

331
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:20,279
if you've been hurt emotionally

332
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:22,320
and you know somebody else who's been

333
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:25,620
hurt emotionally

334
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:27,720
there's a way to identify and connect if

335
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:29,339
you've been hurt physically or you're

336
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,360
sick physically with chronic illness and

337
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:32,459
you're really struggling like

338
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,660
neurological problems

339
00:14:32,459 --> 00:14:35,760
and you have all the different

340
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:38,040
neurological symptoms and you've been to

341
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,899
50 doctors

342
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:42,660
and you talk to somebody else who has

343
00:14:39,899 --> 00:14:45,899
neurological problems

344
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:47,820
there's this similar experience even

345
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:51,480
though they're different

346
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:54,800
that's what makes the chronically ill

347
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:57,839
truly like bond in numbers

348
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:59,459
especially if they're people

349
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:01,320
who have been sick and they've gone

350
00:14:59,459 --> 00:15:03,660
through so much not being validated

351
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:05,519
being told they're crazy being told that

352
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:07,680
it's all in their head being told that

353
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:10,380
it's their fault of why they're sick

354
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,540
being told that they maybe manifested

355
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:14,940
their sickness being told that

356
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:17,040
it's their fault they're a faulty person

357
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:18,120
being told that it's their genes or

358
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,760
genetic

359
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:23,839
makeup of their body

360
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,839
all these things

361
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:30,000
if we're not isolated from those who

362
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:32,600
have gone through similar situations

363
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,639
sometimes we feel completely alone

364
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:37,800
especially when the experts we consult

365
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:40,139
or the people in our lives imply or

366
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:42,000
outright tell us that we've imagined or

367
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:43,860
created our illness do you know anybody

368
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
that's ever been told they created their

369
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:47,459
illness

370
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,880
do you guys I don't ask you guys enough

371
00:15:47,459 --> 00:15:52,620
like questions around that do you know

372
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,600
anybody

373
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:56,339
that they were told they must be

374
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:59,579
creating their sickness

375
00:15:56,339 --> 00:16:02,639
they must be creating their illness

376
00:15:59,579 --> 00:16:04,320
I'm not sure if any of you guys have run

377
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:07,220
into anybody like that or you know

378
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,220
anybody like that

379
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:12,360
because so many people

380
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:13,320
are told they created it it's their

381
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:15,480
fault

382
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:17,339
they're the reason

383
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:19,320
they're thinking

384
00:16:17,339 --> 00:16:21,959
their thought process

385
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:23,699
they haven't figured out how to correct

386
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:26,660
their thought process

387
00:16:23,699 --> 00:16:26,660
to stop it

388
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:32,160
there's still a stigma Around The

389
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:34,620
Chronic suffering a result of how little

390
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:38,660
it's understood it can be hard to find

391
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:38,660
true help from someone who gets it

392
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:44,339
that's another thing too is how many

393
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:48,079
people have been seeking help for their

394
00:16:44,339 --> 00:16:48,079
chronic illness seeking help

395
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:54,420
for their pain and suffering

396
00:16:50,699 --> 00:16:55,680
and they can't find a professional that

397
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:57,420
gets it

398
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,399
they can't find a professional that

399
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:01,800
understands it

400
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:04,500
maybe they do and maybe it takes 10

401
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:06,480
professionals maybe it takes 15 20

402
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:10,439
health professionals

403
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:12,540
maybe it takes 30. but finding someone

404
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:15,120
to understand what they're going through

405
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:16,439
and that gets it is

406
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:20,000
so

407
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:20,000
so hard for so many

408
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:25,740
it can be hard to find true help from

409
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:28,020
someone who gets it rest assured even if

410
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:30,000
you believe that you are the only one to

411
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:32,520
know the particular pain of fighting for

412
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,919
your life well those around you look at

413
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:37,200
you with skepticism that your muscle

414
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:38,580
stiffness or brain fog or fatigue is

415
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:42,900
really that bad

416
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:45,240
others who Bend through near nearly the

417
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:48,299
exact same struggle are out there and

418
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:52,559
that leads us to this whole thing

419
00:17:48,299 --> 00:17:53,940
even if you can't find someone that

420
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,500
truly believes what you're suffering

421
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:58,559
with and what you're going through even

422
00:17:55,500 --> 00:18:01,860
if you can't convince someone

423
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:04,740
that what your symptoms are are real

424
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:07,200
like the chronic fatigue that you have

425
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:09,000
all the twitching and the Tremors and

426
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,740
the pain and the panic attacks and the

427
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,440
anxiety and the headaches and the

428
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:16,740
migraines even

429
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:18,900
if you can't find someone or you don't

430
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:21,360
know someone that really gets it that

431
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:22,980
really understands your struggles and

432
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,600
your suffering and the pain you're in

433
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:26,820
and your symptoms

434
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,799
just know there's somebody out there

435
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:30,299
that's going through it as well there's

436
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:33,299
somebody out there that understands

437
00:18:30,299 --> 00:18:36,380
that's going through

438
00:18:33,299 --> 00:18:36,380
what you're going through

439
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:42,780
the emotions that went along with

440
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:44,820
fighting to be heard are some of what we

441
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:46,440
release when we cleanse so this goes

442
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,340
into the cleansing a little bit I wanted

443
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,919
to

444
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:54,360
head to the cleansing aspect

445
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:56,520
of this Courtney says the

446
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:58,500
the migraines are brutal for you the

447
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:00,600
margarines

448
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:02,960
so I'm reading out a cleanse the heel

449
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,960
right here

450
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:06,620
migraine I see that

451
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:12,600
I'm reading out a cleanse the heel I'm

452
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:14,460
talking about cleansing And the emotions

453
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:17,600
involved a little bit

454
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:17,600
so that's where we are

455
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,919
the emotions that went along with

456
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:27,840
fighting to be heard are some of what we

457
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:31,140
release when we cleanse

458
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:33,299
so when we start to heal and we start to

459
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:34,980
cleanse

460
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:36,780
emotions

461
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:41,700
are releasing

462
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:45,200
Trish on Facebook it's page 459.

463
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:45,200
so 4 59.

464
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:52,980
we release

465
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:55,860
a lot of our old hurt when we cleanse

466
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:58,320
we release information that's in our

467
00:19:55,860 --> 00:20:00,799
cells that's in our organs when we

468
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,799
cleanse

469
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:07,440
those struggles also lead to emotional

470
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:09,299
based adrenaline that flowed through our

471
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,559
veins and got stored in our cells and

472
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:12,539
this leads to something that's really

473
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:14,700
important anytime we go through an

474
00:20:12,539 --> 00:20:17,059
emotional experience an adrenaline surge

475
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:17,059
occurs

476
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:22,140
a surge of adrenaline

477
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:25,200
fires up

478
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:26,880
if you hear bad news your adrenals start

479
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,860
to pump

480
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,200
and they're releasing all of this

481
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:33,900
corrosive adrenaline

482
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,640
and all of that adrenaline is flooding

483
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:37,440
every cell inside your body it's going

484
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:39,960
through your bones it's going into your

485
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,940
bones the cells of the inside your bones

486
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:43,380
the cells inside your organs your

487
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:45,179
connective tissue

488
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:47,820
it's going it's rushing through your

489
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:49,500
lymphatic system it's going into your

490
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:52,500
nervous system it's going into your

491
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:54,480
brain it's going throughout your body

492
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:57,600
so in any time we go through something

493
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:59,400
any kind of experience

494
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:02,280
we get this

495
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:05,220
surge of adrenaline

496
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:07,440
firing up into our bloodstream

497
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:10,260
and all that adrenaline has to find its

498
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:13,320
way either out of the body or it stores

499
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:17,760
itself into fat cells

500
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:23,120
it stores itself into organ tissue

501
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:23,120
and that adrenaline harbored information

502
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:28,500
because when we go through a difficult

503
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:30,120
time like fear or betrayal or some kind

504
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,679
of chaos that happens in our life

505
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:35,720
whatever that is

506
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:35,720
or we're just upset about something

507
00:21:36,179 --> 00:21:40,980
that information

508
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:43,860
this gets transmuted it gets transmuted

509
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:47,580
into that adrenaline and infuses itself

510
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:49,860
into cells and it sticks around into our

511
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:52,500
fat storage in our body into our fat

512
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:55,039
cells in our body into tissue and organ

513
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,039
tissue

514
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:02,460
so struggles that we have lead to

515
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:04,440
emotional based adrenaline that flowed

516
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:09,360
through our veins and got stored in our

517
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:15,440
cells now get ready for this as we detox

518
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:15,440
as we start to cleanse and detox to heal

519
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:22,679
some of the feelings may come back up

520
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:24,240
that were in that adrenaline going all

521
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:25,919
the way back

522
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,620
so if you had something happen to you

523
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:31,500
last year or six months ago

524
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:33,539
or two years ago or ten years ago or

525
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:35,159
even further in your life if you went

526
00:22:33,539 --> 00:22:36,840
through some abuse if you went through

527
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:38,820
some kind of hardship

528
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:41,220
some kind of

529
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:43,020
difficult time a relationship a

530
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:47,520
situation

531
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:49,320
and it created an adrenaline surge

532
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:52,080
throughout your body

533
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:53,580
that adrenaline was released during that

534
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:56,400
hard time

535
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:58,080
so adrenaline is coded it's got

536
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,120
information in it

537
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:03,559
it'll have information of that hard time

538
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:03,559
that you went through information

539
00:23:03,659 --> 00:23:08,820
of that difficult time that betrayal

540
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:12,539
that hardship that loss in there

541
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:15,059
and then it stores deep in your cells so

542
00:23:12,539 --> 00:23:17,640
as we detox

543
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:20,940
we might get some feelings that come

544
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:23,820
back in different ways

545
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:25,620
so when you're cleansing those poisons

546
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:27,299
and toxins and you're restoring your

547
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:29,340
physical body and you're bringing

548
00:23:27,299 --> 00:23:30,900
yourself back and you're working on your

549
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:33,780
healing

550
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:35,580
you may experience

551
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:37,200
some sadness some different feelings

552
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:40,740
some different experiences and different

553
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:43,140
emotions that are coming out of

554
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:45,840
the cells coming out of the fat cells

555
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:48,600
coming out of the fat storage bin

556
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:50,820
coming out of the liver

557
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:52,440
coming out of the spleen

558
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:54,659

00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:17,640
nostalgia

569
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:19,500
that's almost uncomfortable in a way

570
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:21,780
where they feel like something's going

571
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:24,600
on what's this nostalgic feeling the

572
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:27,120
sense I'm getting what is this

573
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:28,200
so some people will have that come over

574
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:31,260
them

575
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:33,539
when they're cleansing and detoxing

576
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:37,260
Pearl said wow I'm always amazed by the

577
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:39,120
information thank you for being here

578
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:41,100
Saints who says

579
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:43,380
might want to try the anger shifter

580
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:45,600
brain shot works better than any calming

581
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:50,000
medication it has changed my life I used

582
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:50,000
to be told I was born angry not anymore

583
00:24:51,179 --> 00:24:54,960
so one person can find themselves with

584
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:58,080
that nostalgia

585
00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:01,919
another may go through intense dreams so

586
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:05,460
when we're cleansing and detoxing

587
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:07,860
we can go through some serious streams

588
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:09,840
dreams of running away from people

589
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:13,440
dreams of

590
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:16,140
being chased dreams that don't make

591
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:18,299
sense on any level dreams that are a

592
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:20,539
little bit scary a bumpy ride dreams

593
00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:20,539
that

594
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:28,320
that feel unsettling but we may dream a

595
00:25:24,419 --> 00:25:30,120
lot when we're cleansing and detoxing

596
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,820
the reason why is because when you're

597
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:35,039
cleansing and detoxing adrenaline is

598
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:38,940
loosing up in those fat cells adrenaline

599
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:40,740
is loosening up in the organ tissue and

600
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:42,900
the cells in the organ

601
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:44,700
and adrenaline is starting to leave and

602
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,960
get into the bloodstream and it floats

603
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:49,260
around and it's got these messages

604
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:51,419
inside of it which is you hurt me a long

605
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:53,460
time ago you didn't understand me a long

606
00:25:51,419 --> 00:25:55,679
time ago you didn't validate me a long

607
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:57,900
time ago I was suffering I was going

608
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:59,820
through a hard time

609
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:02,700
and you didn't understand no one

610
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:05,340
understood I had a loss I had a hardship

611
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:07,799
something happened to me I had a breakup

612
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:09,539
I had a bad divorce whatever it is that

613
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:11,400
adrenaline is floating through the

614
00:26:09,539 --> 00:26:13,320
bloodstream in the veins and just

615
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:16,380
swimming around and that adrenaline has

616
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:18,779
information in it for when you had a

617
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:20,400
difficult time in your life or a time

618
00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:23,760
that you didn't think was difficult at

619
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:25,860
the time but it was difficult

620
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:28,440
you were just in survival mode you might

621
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:30,600
have been someone that was in survival

622
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:34,620
mode

623
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:37,320
and when you were in survival mode you

624
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:39,600
didn't really know at the time and that

625
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:41,279
moment how difficult things were you

626
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:44,600
didn't know in that moment or at that

627
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:44,600
time how hard it was

628
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:50,820
it was really hard but you just were in

629
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:54,720
survival mode and you had to move

630
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:57,360
forward and Forge ahead but adrenaline

631
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:59,580
was occurring during that time and it's

632
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:01,620
stored inside the cells of the body it's

633
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:05,760
stored inside the cells of your tissue

634
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:08,820
your organs in your bones and then

635
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:10,679
you started cleansing and detoxing you

636
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:12,480
started doing it

637
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:14,400
the right way

638
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,440
that's safe for the body

639
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,900
you started doing it in a powerful way

640
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:21,720
that actually really does detox and

641
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:24,960
cleanse and purify

642
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:27,659
and you started doing that

643
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:30,600
and then lo and behold

644
00:27:27,659 --> 00:27:32,820
something was being released

645
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:36,240
something toxic something that was there

646
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:38,279
for a long time something that was there

647
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,559
when you were living your life years ago

648
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:42,240
may not even realize how bad things were

649
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:45,779
in that moment in your life

650
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:48,000
maybe it was just a quick Moment In Time

651
00:27:45,779 --> 00:27:50,400
someone texted you something bad 10

652
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,520
years ago whatever it was and it gave

653
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:56,640
you a surge and boom it soaked into

654
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:58,919
those cells and then it's coming out and

655
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,260
some people have a lot of that inside of

656
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:02,700
them they have a lot of hardship

657
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:06,419
betrayal emotional

658
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:08,480
distrust from broken trust and as

659
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:10,620
they're cleansing

660
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:13,740
that toxic

661
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:16,380
information that's inside the cells that

662
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:18,960
were stored there deep there from the

663
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:23,100
adrenaline being so toxic started to

664
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:26,220
release and dislodge and break out

665
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:28,919
of its catacombs and start to release

666
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:30,480
and go into the bloodstream and as it's

667
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:32,460
circulating in the bloodstream you're

668
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,320
having strange dreams

669
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:36,120
you're having dreams that don't make

670
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:38,340
sense you're having scary dreams

671
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:41,340
uncomfortable dreams

672
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:43,799
and then when you're awake you feel like

673
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:45,960
some kind of nostalgia some kind of

674
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:47,220
sadness comes over you you're thinking

675
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:50,720
about things you haven't thought about

676
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:54,720
in years you're emotionally detoxing

677
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,720
emotionally detoxing

678
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:59,520
is what you're doing

679
00:28:57,179 --> 00:29:02,039
that makeup chick over there in IG says

680
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:05,279
I wonder if my friend's murder and all

681
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:06,779
the grief has anything to do with all my

682
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:10,279
health issues

683
00:29:06,779 --> 00:29:10,279
so sorry to hear that

684
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:16,559
but when we go through something

685
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:18,480
so intense

686
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:20,159
where you go through something so

687
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,200
catastrophic where a friend gets

688
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:24,380
murdered or something happened in your

689
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,380
life

690
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:28,860
or a friend

691
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:31,500
lost her life in a car crash or however

692
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:33,419
it is if you've gone through something

693
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:35,220
like that and it affected you

694
00:29:33,419 --> 00:29:38,159
emotionally then that means an

695
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:40,740
adrenaline surged occurred

696
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:44,580
and it was the fear

697
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:47,940
the loss adrenaline it's the blend and

698
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:49,799
that had to go somewhere and it tends to

699
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:51,480
store inner cells especially if we're

700
00:29:49,799 --> 00:29:54,240
doing Comfort Foods at the time because

701
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:57,360
we are we're doing Comfort Foods

702
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:59,520
we end up doing comforting foods and we

703
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:01,260
capture it in the comfort food it soaks

704
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:03,539
up that adrenaline and then it stores it

705
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:06,299
deep in her liver into the fat cells

706
00:30:03,539 --> 00:30:09,600
deep down in there

707
00:30:06,299 --> 00:30:13,440
Edith C on YouTube yes I just finished

708
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:16,740
369 cleanse that's aim here actually

709
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:18,919
and had a lot of weird dreams now I

710
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:18,919
understand

711
00:30:20,279 --> 00:30:24,720
Margaret Hurst says wow my dreams are

712
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:27,360
crazy I have forgiven a lot of people

713
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:29,279
after messages in my dreams

714
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,779
this is the kind of healing that occurs

715
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:32,940
when you're taking care of yourself when

716
00:30:30,779 --> 00:30:34,679
you're doing some cleansing Rachel Jones

717
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:37,200
says I do the morning cleanse every day

718
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:39,299
since February and have healed my gluten

719
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:42,960
intolerance psoriasis nerve inflammation

720
00:30:39,299 --> 00:30:45,679
and I am so much happier as a result

721
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,679
incredible

722
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:53,580
it can be hard to find true help from

723
00:30:51,539 --> 00:30:55,200
someone who gets it out there

724
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:57,299
and that's what I love about the medical

725
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,580
meme community

726
00:30:57,299 --> 00:31:01,679
because people get it

727
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:03,600
they get it here

728
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:06,240
they get it now I know there's a lot of

729
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:08,340
posers that come into here that pretend

730
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,899
they get it they just want to take

731
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:11,399
advantage of the medical meme Community

732
00:31:09,899 --> 00:31:12,240
I've seen this over and over and over

733
00:31:11,399 --> 00:31:14,520
again

734
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:16,799
or they were really never that sick

735
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:18,960
they don't understand that

736
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:20,640
what real struggles are with their their

737
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,720
health yet they're just not there

738
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:24,480
they're just

739
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:25,679
had a little bit not so sick stuff going

740
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,419
on

741
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:28,740
but man when you've been there you've

742
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:30,779
been there and you know what it is and

743
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:32,760
you know how to identify it Kim Miller

744
00:31:30,779 --> 00:31:35,159
says my mom said she never used to dream

745
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:36,960
when she was on caffeine for years she

746
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:38,220
got off the coffee and started dreaming

747
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,320
again

748
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:46,620
all coffee is another thing that

749
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:46,620
suppresses emotions and berries emotions

750
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:51,539
we walk around we spend a lifetime

751
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:54,360
suppressing and suppressing and

752
00:31:51,539 --> 00:31:56,640
suppressing we spend a lifetime burying

753
00:31:54,360 --> 00:32:00,059
and burying

754
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:02,220
goes into the old trash bin

755
00:32:00,059 --> 00:32:05,640
we spend a lifetime pushing it down

756
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:08,220
shoving it down shoving it down

757
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:11,840
right deep into the cells in the organs

758
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:11,840
right down deep in there

759
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:15,779
Diana

760
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:19,020
says what is the best thing to do when

761
00:32:15,779 --> 00:32:20,760
you're detoxing this old adrenaline

762
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:23,659
did you sign up to the collecting Stones

763
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:23,659
meditation Journey

764
00:32:24,659 --> 00:32:29,100
it's a free

765
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:30,779
incredible seven day healing Journey

766
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:34,100
that starts tomorrow link is in

767
00:32:30,779 --> 00:32:34,100
description link is in a profile

768
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:40,020
and when you recognize the emotions and

769
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:41,940
you recognize the adrenaline

770
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:43,500
if you recognize

771
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:45,059
what these emotions are and where

772
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:46,559
they're coming from they're coming from

773
00:32:45,059 --> 00:32:48,960
that Old adrenaline storage it's

774
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:52,740
surfacing and coming out that's one way

775
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:54,600
to help see you later alligator bye and

776
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:56,840
have it leave the system and leave the

777
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,840
system

778
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:03,059
we spend decades in our life shoving it

779
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:05,159
all down

780
00:33:03,059 --> 00:33:06,419
but when we let it out we can let it

781
00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:08,700
pass

782
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:11,159
if we do a medical medium cleanse we can

783
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:13,380
get it out and have it leave instead of

784
00:33:11,159 --> 00:33:15,539
recirculate

785
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:17,279
and that leads me to the next thing I

786
00:33:15,539 --> 00:33:19,620
wanted to say

787
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:22,980
if you're somebody that

788
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:25,080
has a lot of toxic emotion stored from

789
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:28,019
toxic adrenaline deep inside your cell

790
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:30,720
tissue in your cell walls deep inside

791
00:33:28,019 --> 00:33:31,679
your connective tissue every part of

792
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,620
your body

793
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:36,179
deep in your liver what happens is that

794
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:38,820
if you're not

795
00:33:36,179 --> 00:33:40,559
cleansing it out properly it recycles

796
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:42,360
and recirculates and goes right back

797
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:44,100
into fat storage or right back into

798
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:46,919
liver storage

799
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:49,019
so it kind of taunts you for years to

800
00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:51,360
come there's something in there that

801
00:33:49,019 --> 00:33:53,279
never was let out there's something in

802
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:55,919
you that's been trapped in there for so

803
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:58,140
many years and never got out

804
00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:00,840
and then it just kind of like haunts you

805
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:03,000
and haunts you and you relive it a

806
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:04,620
little bit not really unsure not sure

807
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,600
what you're reliving but you're reliving

808
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:08,399
it you're feeling it it's giving you

809
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:10,859
that sense of like what's wrong with me

810
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:12,599
what's wrong with me emotionally I must

811
00:34:10,859 --> 00:34:14,159
see another therapist I'm gonna have to

812
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:16,760
see another therapist and another

813
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:16,760
therapist

814
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,099
a therapist shopping

815
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:25,320
educating myself

816
00:34:23,099 --> 00:34:28,020
nothing like waking up to a bitter

817
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:30,060
poison of utter and total betrayal

818
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:32,339
educating myself

819
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:34,619
yes indeed

820
00:34:32,339 --> 00:34:36,720
I concur greatly as you would probably

821
00:34:34,619 --> 00:34:38,520
know from the information

822
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:41,119
and fall cities that are always swimming

823
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:41,119
around out there

824
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:48,240
Melanie Foss survival since 2013

825
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:50,879
greetings from Germany at the moment

826
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:52,740
I'm in the Netherlands incredible

827
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:55,260
greetings

828
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:57,420
Gina says if we have OCD is it okay to

829
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:59,640
wear gloves when collecting and cleaning

830
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:01,099
Stones until they are cleaned indeed it

831
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:04,520
is

832
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:04,520
indeed it is

833
00:35:11,339 --> 00:35:14,820
even if you believe that you are the

834
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:18,420
only one

835
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:21,180
to know the particular pain of fighting

836
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:23,280
for your life well those around you look

837
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:24,900
at you with skepticism

838
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:28,099
that your muscle stiffness and your

839
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:28,099
brain fog and your fatigue

840
00:37:26,099 --> 00:37:30,000
an experience where they're just

841
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:32,339
bringing their lives back from so much

842
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,320
they've been through

843
00:37:32,339 --> 00:37:36,599
this means that even as cells release

844
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:38,760
old adrenaline

845
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:42,060
that carries difficulties from our past

846
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:44,160
it's not a reckless process

847
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:47,160
your brain is getting critical glucose

848
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:49,980
and mineral salts to give you grounding

849
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:52,140
that you need

850
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:54,000
you don't need to engage or process the

851
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:55,680
emotions or feelings that come up on a

852
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,359
cleanse and that's another thing too and

853
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,740
need people to understand that when

854
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:00,780
you're cleansing

855
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:02,760
and emotions are coming out it doesn't

856
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:05,339
mean you have to process them for them

857
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:08,579
to leave and go

858
00:38:05,339 --> 00:38:10,079
that's something that's really important

859
00:38:08,579 --> 00:38:12,119
because when you're cleansing it's

860
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:16,020
usually not the time or space to go deep

861
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:18,960
into emotional grit you want it to pass

862
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:22,760
through and go you want to you want it

863
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,760
to leave the system and Purge out

864
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:31,320
it's usually not the time or space to

865
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,579
deal with emotions that are really

866
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:35,240
intense when you're cleansing or

867
00:38:32,579 --> 00:38:35,240
detoxing

868
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:40,859
but what I love about the medical medium

869
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:43,740
cleanses Spirit of compassions cleanses

870
00:38:40,859 --> 00:38:45,420
is that it allows it to leave

871
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:46,859
and that's why so many people are

872
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:51,500
getting their lives back too because

873
00:38:46,859 --> 00:38:51,500
they feel they can stay on the cleanse

874
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:57,960
everyone is different in how or when

875
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:00,720
they need to process life sometimes

876
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:04,140
mirror sometimes

877
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:05,700
Miracle states of emotion or healing can

878
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:07,140
happen actually during one of these

879
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:09,839
cleanses

880
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:12,000
and I see that a lot a great lifting of

881
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:14,780
energy could occur a sensation of weight

882
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,780
off your back

883
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:19,380
I see the tech demons are after us today

884
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:23,940
by the way they're just messing up our

885
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:25,800
Tech in any way possible the tech devils

886
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:28,260
Tech betrayal too laugh out loud

887
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:30,680
educating myself yeah let's not forget

888
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:30,680
that

889
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:35,599
I think they just wait for me to go on

890
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:35,599
and go live

891
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:41,760
there's nothing better than a sensation

892
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:43,859
that was so heavy Weighing on your back

893
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:47,420
getting lifted

894
00:39:43,859 --> 00:39:47,420
lift it for good

895
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,980
there's no rule about how our emotional

896
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:53,700
processing is supposed to happen by the

897
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:55,260
way

898
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:58,560
everybody's different everybody

899
00:39:55,260 --> 00:40:00,660
everybody processes different

900
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:03,119
usually the shift that they can have

901
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:04,980
occurs after the cleanse is over when

902
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:07,500
we've had enough time to gain insight

903
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:10,500
into what's surfaced during the cleanse

904
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:12,300
after the cleanse we become wiser in the

905
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:14,900
emotional area in so many ways that

906
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:14,900
leads me to this

907
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:20,700
you're sick

908
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:22,560
you find the answers

909
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:24,839
you do one of the most powerful cleanses

910
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:27,119
there is to heal that has a track record

911
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:30,020
of people healing

912
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:30,020
you get better

913
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:38,339
and you get better and wiser for it

914
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:40,260
and emotionally stronger

915
00:40:38,339 --> 00:40:43,280
you get sick

916
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:43,280
you cleanse

917
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:49,220
you heal you become wiser

918
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:56,220
as we release poisons and toxins that

919
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:59,280
were deeply embedded into cells of all

920
00:40:56,220 --> 00:41:03,119
kinds including fat cells that are now

921
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:04,920
bursting and draining while we cleanse

922
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:08,160
you know when you cleanse you guys fat

923
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:11,099
cells are bursting and draining

924
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:13,740
no one talks about that

925
00:41:11,099 --> 00:41:19,280
been talking about that for years

926
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:19,280
we cleanse and fat cells are bursting

927
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:24,720
they're bursting and draining while we

928
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:26,339
cleanse those poisons and toxins that

929
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:29,160
are now flowing through a bloodstream

930
00:41:26,339 --> 00:41:32,820
are on their way out of our body and it

931
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:34,740
can affect our taste and smell as well

932
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:37,200
sometimes while cleansing someone will

933
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:38,520
taste a manufactured food they ate when

934
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,660
they were a child they wanted to ask you

935
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:41,880
guys that question do you ever

936
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:43,740
experience that

937
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:46,260
do you ever experience when your cleanse

938
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:47,099
isn't when you're doing a cleanse in any

939
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:49,740
way

940
00:41:47,099 --> 00:41:51,839
that you all of a sudden like I remember

941
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:53,460
the taste that food when I was a kid

942
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:54,960
that's a cheeseburger

1130
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:54,540

Journey

1183
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:53,099
smoking and send that baby into the pond

1184
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:56,160
on day seven

1186
00:51:56,160 --> 00:52:01,740
two packs a day quit over a night 12

1187
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:04,040
years ago 33 years ago 12 years 33 years

1188
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:04,040
ago

1189
00:52:05,819 --> 00:52:10,020
you notice that what won't come up on

1190
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:11,700
the cleanse is the taste of a grape or

1191
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:13,740
an apple or a celery stick or a

1192
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:16,380
strawberry or a berry or a Blackberry

1193
00:52:13,740 --> 00:52:18,240
these are foods that fight toxins they

1194
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:20,280
aren't toxic foods themselves you'll

1195
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:23,040
notice that it's only the toxic food

1196
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:25,680
that surfaces during a cleanse you'll

1197
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:27,839
notice it was those cupcakes

1198
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:30,660
that were packaged when you were a kid

1199
00:52:27,839 --> 00:52:33,480
those donuts that were packaged or donut

1200
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:35,819
at a donut place

1201
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:36,960
a creamy donut place or whatever and

1202
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:40,319
whatever

1203
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:43,040
it is it's stored into your cells deep

1204
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:43,040
down there

1205
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:50,099
W green

1206
00:52:47,099 --> 00:52:52,619
on YouTube I was a smoker and my dad was

1207
00:52:50,099 --> 00:52:55,400
a smoker I tasted the smoke while

1208
00:52:52,619 --> 00:52:55,400
detoxing

1209
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:07,680
your emotional well-being can become

1210
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:09,900
more fine-tuned as well that's that's

1211
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:13,200

1212
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:15,300

1218
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:26,520
that garbage inside of you and then you

some of us have been through so much we

1223
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:36,900
have to have compassion for our bodies

1224
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:39,839
while

1225
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:40,980
we heal and while everybody heals we've

1226
00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:44,579

00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:12,619
live

1266
00:55:14,540 --> 00:55:19,099

become more emotional emotional after

1271
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:35,220
cleansing rather that you can become

1272
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:37,319
more emotionally protected and

1273
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:40,020
emotionally sound

1274
00:55:37,319 --> 00:55:42,920

1277
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:51,559
emotionally sound

1278
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:51,559
George news over there on

years I got your back I got your back

1286
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:12,720
smoking is tough on the body it tips the

1287
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:15,960
scale in the wrong direction

1288
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:18,180
it's hard on the body but I do not shame

1289
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:20,339
or blame or

1290
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:23,839
judge anyone

who's still burning coals

1292
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:31,559
old hurt can create such a brain fog

1293
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:33,420
allowing us to make the same mistake

1294
00:56:31,559 --> 00:56:36,599
over and over again I read that wrong

1295
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:37,740
let's do it again old hurt can create a

1296
00:56:36,599 --> 00:56:39,599
fog

1297
00:56:37,740 --> 00:56:41,640
that's what it is not a brain fun

1298
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:43,920
allowing us to make the same mistake

1299
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:45,780
over and over again just as when we're

1300
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:47,099

00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:04,200
that right now because I want to get old

1310
00:57:01,859 --> 00:57:06,200
hurt out of you guys and I want to let

1311
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:10,079
it go and get it out of your system

1312
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:11,220
because once it's out of your system

1313
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:14,280
man

1314
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:17,579
Life Changes

1315
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:20,040
many of us dealt with secondhand smoke

1316
00:57:17,579 --> 00:57:23,000
trust me many of us have dealt with

1317
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:23,000
secondhand smoke

1318
00:57:24,839 --> 00:57:29,640
old hurt can create such a fog allowing

1319
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:31,800
us to make the same mistake over and

1320
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:33,720
over again just as when we're in pain

1321
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:36,780
from burning our hand on the stove we

1322
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:40,880
may turn away in fear and inner haste

1323
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:40,880
accidentally back into the fireplace

1324
00:57:41,099 --> 00:57:46,319
when we aren't filled with poisons and

1325
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:48,859
fear-based betrayal-based harm-based

1326
00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:48,859
adrenaline

1327
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:53,760
when we're not filled with all that crap

1328
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:55,559
anymore all that adrenaline and

1329
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:57,720
fear-based and harm-based adrenaline

1330
00:57:55,559 --> 00:58:00,059
when it's out of our cells and out of

1331
00:57:57,720 --> 00:58:02,460
our fat cells and out of our organs and

1332
00:58:00,059 --> 00:58:05,819
out of our body and our bloodstream the

1333
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:08,220
door opens up old hurt can leave it can

1334
00:58:05,819 --> 00:58:10,500
leave and you do the collecting Stones

1335
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:14,540
meditation Journey

1336
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:14,540
forget it wait till you do that

1337
00:58:18,359 --> 00:58:22,619
we're going to be able to see the

1338
00:58:20,099 --> 00:58:25,140
momentary pain clearly rather than find

1339
00:58:22,619 --> 00:58:27,420
ourselves in a fog of old percolating

1340
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:29,579
hurt and that's going to let us take

1341
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:31,319
care of ourselves properly rather than

1342
00:58:29,579 --> 00:58:34,619
hurt ourselves even more by making

1343
00:58:31,319 --> 00:58:38,059
mistakes out of desperation

1344
00:58:34,619 --> 00:58:38,059
you know your decision making

1345
00:58:38,119 --> 00:58:42,119
comes clear

1346
00:58:40,619 --> 00:58:43,619
comes clear

1347
00:58:42,119 --> 00:58:45,900
you're cleansing you're getting the junk

1348
00:58:43,619 --> 00:58:48,240
out you see the truth you know what's

1349
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:50,760
going on your healing your body's

1350
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:53,700
healing and things come clear and more

1351
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:56,280
clear and more clear Clarity happens and

1352
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:58,079
that's incredible Saint Suey says I

1353
00:58:56,280 --> 00:59:00,420
can't believe I'm still alive after so

1354
00:58:58,079 --> 00:59:02,540
many decades of abusing my body I'm a

1355
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:06,020
walking Miracle to be able to heal now

1356
00:59:02,540 --> 00:59:06,020
drop the mic

1357
00:59:06,059 --> 00:59:09,020
drop the mic

1358
00:59:11,819 --> 00:59:17,280
so many don't realize that out there

1359
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:19,980
so many don't realize that

1360
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:24,740
after cleansing the right way you often

1361
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:24,740
become wiser beyond your years

1362
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:31,280
after cleansing the right way

1363
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:38,579
we often become wiser

1364
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:41,339
beyond our years

1365
00:59:38,579 --> 00:59:44,000
Becca Johnson said 369 cleanse made me a

1366
00:59:41,339 --> 00:59:44,000
lot wiser

1367
00:59:45,799 --> 00:59:51,059
you may find yourself a little more

1368
00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:52,920
guarded in a good way

1369
00:59:51,059 --> 00:59:55,380
you may find yourself a little bit more

1370
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:57,980
guarded in a good way you're more

1371
00:59:55,380 --> 01:00:00,900
cautious about when to be vulnerable

1372
00:59:57,980 --> 01:00:03,059
make better decisions about whom to

1373
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:04,619
involve yourself with and whom to

1374
01:00:03,059 --> 01:00:06,900
confide in

1375
01:00:04,619 --> 01:00:09,540
and you're more intuitive about when to

1376
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:12,059
drop off your guard and open the door

1377
01:00:09,540 --> 01:00:15,119
for a healthier friendship or

1378
01:00:12,059 --> 01:00:17,280
relationship you become more keen

1379
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:18,960
you clear out the junk and garbage in

1380
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:20,819
the old emotions that have been sitting

1381
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:22,980
there rotting and festering and you

1382
01:00:20,819 --> 01:00:26,460
don't recreate the same patterns over

1383
01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:29,339
and over again you break the patterns so

1384
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:31,260
you're not a slave to those patterns so

1385
01:00:29,339 --> 01:00:33,420
you're not stuck in that so you're not

1386
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:35,640
getting in another toxic relationship

1387
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:37,799
that takes you down so you're not

1388
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:39,660
getting into another bad friendship that

1389
01:00:37,799 --> 01:00:42,660
takes you down so you know make another

1390
01:00:39,660 --> 01:00:44,700
Wrong Turn you get clarity you cleanse

1391
01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:47,339

1392
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:49,680
that's stored inside every cell and

1393
01:00:47,339 --> 01:00:52,140
inside every every organ in your body

1394
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:54,599
and you clear that out you get rid of it

1395
01:00:52,140 --> 01:00:56,700
and you open the door you open the door

1396
01:00:54,599 --> 01:00:59,339
to Clarity and what happens is you

1397
01:00:56,700 --> 01:01:01,440

1398
01:00:59,339 --> 01:01:03,839
mindful because when you rid yourselves

1399
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:05,940
of enough toxins and poisons and viruses

1400
01:01:03,839 --> 01:01:07,980
and unproductive bacteria and old

1401
01:01:05,940 --> 01:01:10,319
adrenaline that harbored past emotions

1402
01:01:07,980 --> 01:01:13,339
you become better able to avoid

1403
01:01:10,319 --> 01:01:13,339
repeating mistakes

1404
01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:21,200

1407
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:29,960
in a million years come up with the

1408
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:31,859
information in these eight Medical

1409

bike racer no Training Day

1493
01:05:31,740 --> 01:05:37,980
no Sprints no physical injury no

1494
01:05:34,859 --> 01:05:41,940
completion can compare with the struggle

1495
01:05:37,980 --> 01:05:45,119
and challenges of chronic illness it's a

1496
01:05:41,940 --> 01:05:47,520
whole other level in my case brain fog

1497
01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:51,480
neurological fatigue chronic fatigue leg

1498
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:54,299
pain Etc if I didn't have the experience

1499
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:56,460
of competing at the elite level I would

1500
01:05:54,299 --> 01:05:58,619
have thought and believed that I was

1501
01:05:56,460 --> 01:06:01,619
just weak and I've definitely thought

1502
01:05:58,619 --> 01:06:03,660
that many many times as I was going from

1503
01:06:01,619 --> 01:06:06,299
Doctor to sport doctor to Alternative

1504
01:06:03,660 --> 01:06:08,640
doctor to Alternative sport doctor etc

1505
01:06:06,299 --> 01:06:11,460
etc etc

1506
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:13,619
all training and competition seems like

1507
01:06:11,460 --> 01:06:17,640
a walk in the park compared to the

1508
01:06:13,619 --> 01:06:21,119
torture of chronic illness your word 787

1509
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:22,559
I often think how easy a heavy gym day

1510
01:06:21,119 --> 01:06:25,940
is

1511
01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:25,940
yeah people right

1512
01:06:27,180 --> 01:06:33,900
I often think how easy a heavy gym day

1513
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:36,059
is or Sprints or com competition in

1514
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:37,680
comparison to the constant chronic

1515
01:06:36,059 --> 01:06:40,380
illness suffering

1516
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:42,180
I'm definitely not as impressed as I

1517
01:06:40,380 --> 01:06:44,640
used to be with the athletic

1518
01:06:42,180 --> 01:06:46,740
achievements as I am with the

1519
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:50,539
achievements of the ones that are

1520
01:06:46,740 --> 01:06:50,539
struggling with chronic illness

1521
01:07:01,980 --> 01:07:06,599
and their strength to keep going and

1522
01:07:03,780 --> 01:07:08,880
going forward and healing regardless of

1523
01:07:06,599 --> 01:07:10,920
what the world around them might tell

1524
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:12,660
them

1525
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:15,059
I'm going to read that last line because

1526
01:07:12,660 --> 01:07:17,880
I kind of messed it up are definitely

1527
01:07:15,059 --> 01:07:19,920
not as impressed I'm definitely not as

1528
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:22,559
impressed as I used to be with the

1529
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:24,539
athletic achievements as I am with the

1530
01:07:22,559 --> 01:07:26,940
achievements of the ones that are

1531
01:07:24,539 --> 01:07:28,500
struggling with chronic illness and

1532
01:07:26,940 --> 01:07:29,819
their strength to keep going and going

1533
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:32,099
forward

1534
01:07:29,819 --> 01:07:34,380

01:07:32,099 --> 01:07:35,700
around them might tell them I'm finally

1536
01:07:34,380 --> 01:07:38,220

when you get a chance make sure you own

1544
01:07:55,440 --> 01:08:00,839
this book

or go to the library

1546
01:08:00,839 --> 01:08:04,039
it's mind-blowing information

1547
01:08:04,559 --> 01:08:08,039
this has been

1548
01:08:06,359 --> 01:08:09,660
an incredible experience today just

1549
01:08:08,039 --> 01:08:12,680
hanging out with you guys and seeing how

1550
01:08:09,660 --> 01:08:12,680
many of you guys smoked

1551
01:08:13,559 --> 01:08:19,040
Katie says how to cleanse yourself after

1552
01:08:16,020 --> 01:08:19,040
years of smoking

1553
01:08:19,339 --> 01:08:25,620
that stuff comes out

1554
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:28,199
it comes out of your cells Katie

1555
01:08:25,620 --> 01:08:31,940
when you're doing

1556
01:08:28,199 --> 01:08:31,940

1557
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:39,540
Veronica says do your book want do you

1558
01:08:37,199 --> 01:08:41,699
do you book one-on-one appointments I

1559
01:08:39,540 --> 01:08:44,940
haven't booked one-on-one appointments

1560
01:08:41,699 --> 01:08:48,020
and almost a decade

1561
01:08:44,940 --> 01:08:48,020
been very long time

1562
01:08:49,199 --> 01:08:54,420
um but look out for imposters

1563
01:08:52,259 --> 01:08:56,880
because imposters are actually

1564
01:08:54,420 --> 01:08:59,279
pretending to be me

1565
01:08:56,880 --> 01:09:00,239
and trying to book appointments with

1566
01:08:59,279 --> 01:09:02,339

1567
01:09:00,239 --> 01:09:03,980

they make it look like I'm them whatever

1570
01:09:07,319 --> 01:09:12,839
they're me

1571
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:14,759
and they might even be using a y

1572
01:09:12,839 --> 01:09:18,380
I call it y

1573
01:09:14,759 --> 01:09:18,380
you know what I'm talking about a

1574
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:21,779
y

1575
01:09:19,859 --> 01:09:25,140

do you know why I'm not saying that ah

1581
01:09:40,859 --> 01:09:43,580

1582
01:09:44,699 --> 01:09:47,839
cause you say that

1583
01:09:47,940 --> 01:09:53,160
then that brings it to you that's how

1584
01:09:49,739 --> 01:09:55,920

longest time if I was weak or not you're

1591
01:10:09,300 --> 01:10:12,120

not weak

1593
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:17,300
no one's weak here

1594
01:10:14,580 --> 01:10:17,300
no one

1595
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:23,580
me too true thank you for all your work

1596
01:10:21,900 --> 01:10:26,040
aw

1597
01:10:23,580 --> 01:10:29,159
you guys I could stay on here

1598
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:32,239
I could stay on here all day

1599
01:10:29,159 --> 01:10:32,239
it's how much I love you guys

1600
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:35,940
cold cold white spring you just said you

1601
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:37,260
don't get it you don't get what I was

1602
01:10:35,940 --> 01:10:39,840
saying

1603
01:10:37,260 --> 01:10:42,440
you don't get it

1604
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:42,440
a

1605
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:47,300
but I'm saying a why

1606
01:10:47,820 --> 01:10:50,940
because if you say Spirit tells me

1607
01:10:50,219 --> 01:10:54,380
anyway

1608
01:10:50,940 --> 01:10:54,380
that if you say a

1609
01:10:54,420 --> 01:11:00,420
then it comes to you

1610
01:10:57,060 --> 01:11:02,699
because that's what SOC tells me and I

1611
01:11:00,420 --> 01:11:05,640
believe it because SOC

1612
01:11:02,699 --> 01:11:06,960
doesn't let me down so it's yes that's

1613
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:09,540
what I'm trying to tell you you don't

1614
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:10,860
get it either wanna you don't get it

1615
01:11:09,540 --> 01:11:13,520
come on

1616
01:11:10,860 --> 01:11:13,520

1620
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:31,440
