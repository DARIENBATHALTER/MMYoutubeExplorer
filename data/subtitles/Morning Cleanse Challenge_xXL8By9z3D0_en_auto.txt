[116.24 - 122.40] if you take a look right here and i'm
[119.68 - 125.04] going to it right now so
[122.40 - 127.04] we're getting there so it's page 174
[125.04 - 128.72] that's the morning cleanse
[127.04 - 130.32] just so you know so there's a lot of
[128.72 - 131.76] information in there for you guys to
[130.32 - 133.76] learn how to heal
[131.76 - 135.44] so the morning cleanse is so important
[133.76 - 139.04] because upon waking
[135.44 - 141.68] 16 to 32 ounces of lemon water so that's
[139.04 - 144.56] right there just upon waking you want to
[141.68 - 147.36] use that to flush out the liver to flush
[144.56 - 147.92] it out you need that chance because what
[147.36 - 151.44] we do
[147.92 - 153.20] is we don't do a liver flushing routine
[151.44 - 155.12] everybody thinks their liver is fine
[153.20 - 158.24] they think their liver may not be
[155.12 - 159.60] needing a flush or a cleaning
[158.24 - 162.56] and the medical medium warning cleanse
[159.60 - 164.64] helps to clean our liver every single
[162.56 - 167.52] day every single morning and it's so
[164.64 - 169.12] important to get us better to get us to
[167.52 - 170.80] keep us from getting sick
[169.12 - 172.88] that right there keep our immune system
[170.80 - 174.40] strong flush out those toxins and
[172.88 - 177.60] poisons that age us
[174.40 - 179.76] fast and nobody nobody wants to talk
[177.60 - 181.76] about aging until they start aging
[179.76 - 183.44] that's the other thing too and so they
[181.76 - 184.24] start showing all the signs that they're
[183.44 - 186.56] aging
[184.24 - 188.24] and the skin's wrinkling up a lot more
[186.56 - 189.68] and you get the sun spots and you get
[188.24 - 191.84] all these problems and the medical mean
[189.68 - 193.84] morning cleanse is a great way
[191.84 - 196.08] to really slow that down clean those
[193.84 - 198.08] things up good to see you guys

[211.12 - 213.92] little later

[213.92 - 218.56] liver rescue smoothie for medical medium

[218.56 - 222.64] but i'm going to be doing the medical
[219.68 - 224.00] meme heavy metal detox smoothie right
[222.64 - 226.08] and then there's a lot of recipes in
[224.00 - 230.24] here that are fat free the
[226.08 - 233.76] the goal the goal
[230.24 - 236.08] is to not do any fats before
[233.76 - 238.00] noon really important let's cover that
[236.08 - 240.64] for a second
[238.00 - 242.40] love to cover that right got some peanut
[240.64 - 244.08] butter right here
[242.40 - 245.60] that's the peanut butter right you guys
[244.08 - 246.24] know you love your peanut butter so many
[245.60 - 248.64] of you
[246.24 - 249.44] okay peanut butter is a healthy fat it's
[248.64 - 253.20] a healthy fat
[249.44 - 254.96] it is and but when you're doing this
[253.20 - 258.24] before noon
[254.96 - 261.12] you never cleanse you just can't
[258.24 - 263.04] cleanse nothing will cleanse out of you
[261.12 - 265.44] you won't be able to detox
[263.04 - 266.16] everything toxic inside of us will stay
[265.44 - 268.48] inside of us
[266.16 - 269.28] so when you do your peanut butter before
[268.48 - 272.16] noon
[269.28 - 273.68] nothing leaves your system you don't
[272.16 - 275.12] cleanse if you guys just came on we're

[278.32 - 281.60] is the first day i'm really excited
[280.00 - 283.52] about it right
[281.60 - 284.88] so how many people are doing their
[283.52 - 286.48] coconut oil
[284.88 - 288.48] in the morning how many guys doing
[286.48 - 290.00] coconut oil in the morning so

[291.20 - 295.36] butter
[292.08 - 296.80] in the morning right and how many people
[295.36 - 297.76] are doing their coconut oil in the
[296.80 - 300.16] morning
[297.76 - 301.36] so coconut butter so that's something
[300.16 - 303.36] right there because i know a lot of you
[301.36 - 306.16] guys use this this is a big one
[303.36 - 307.84] you guys use it every single day you put
[306.16 - 309.44] it in your smoothies
[307.84 - 311.20] and that's not recommended by medical
[309.44 - 313.44] medium because once you do that in the
[311.20 - 315.76] morning you don't cleanse
[313.44 - 318.00] right imelda says the morning cleanse
[315.76 - 321.44] and fat-free diet helped me heal
[318.00 - 323.20] my gallbladder incredible amazing
[321.44 - 324.64] it's really important to actually heal
[323.20 - 327.52] the gallbladder
[324.64 - 329.60] to heal your digestive system by being
[327.52 - 331.28] fat free or keeping the fats low i know
[329.60 - 332.08] a lot of you guys can't keep the fats
[331.28 - 334.24] out
[332.08 - 336.24] you can't keep the coconut oil out right
[334.24 - 338.72] you can't keep it all out
[336.24 - 339.92] how many guys are doing like the almonds
[338.72 - 340.96] right here right
[339.92 - 343.68] how many of you guys are doing the
[340.96 - 345.60] almonds you're doing those before noon
[343.68 - 348.00] you're doing those in the morning
[345.60 - 349.12] it's almond butter that's a big one
[348.00 - 350.08] right you guys are doing the almond
[349.12 - 351.76] butter
[350.08 - 353.44] and when you do almond butter in the
[351.76 - 356.00] morning and i'm not saying
[353.44 - 358.08] that almonds are bad i'm not saying
[356.00 - 359.92] walnuts are bad i'm not saying peanut
[358.08 - 361.36] butter is bad i'm not saying anything
[359.92 - 363.28] like that
[361.36 - 364.48] what i'm saying is you're not gonna
[363.28 - 367.36] cleanse
[364.48 - 368.00] if you have your almond butter in the
[367.36 - 370.40] morning
[368.00 - 372.24] it's not gonna happen it's just not
[370.40 - 374.96] really important to know
[372.24 - 376.72] this is great information here's some
[374.96 - 379.60] olive oil right here too
[376.72 - 380.08] some olive oil right healthy fat olive
[379.60 - 382.88] oil
[380.08 - 384.00] right there it really is so you know
[382.88 - 386.08] that's the one thing because people will
[384.00 - 388.32] say medical medium he just you know he
[386.08 - 390.40] thinks avocado's unhealthy he thinks
[388.32 - 393.12] olive oil is unhealthy
[390.40 - 394.72] he thinks peanut butter is unhealthy
[393.12 - 396.48] almond butter is unhealthy
[394.72 - 398.72] that's not what i think it's just that
[396.48 - 401.76] everybody's fatting themselves to death
[398.72 - 403.60] and they can't cleanse and
[401.76 - 404.96] what happens is you might be somebody
[403.60 - 406.08] like yeah but i started getting my
[404.96 - 408.08] symptoms better
[406.08 - 409.12] by eating clean getting rid of processed
[408.08 - 410.80] foods
[409.12 - 412.16] you know eating healthier doing
[410.80 - 414.48] healthier oils
[412.16 - 416.24] healthier fats and i started i started
[414.48 - 417.92] getting better
[416.24 - 419.84] but what happens is you'll get sick
[417.92 - 422.32] later you will get sick
[419.84 - 424.16] later because all that stuff will build
[422.32 - 426.48] up and build up in your system good to
[424.16 - 427.60] see you guys coming on
[426.48 - 430.72] how many of you guys are doing your
[427.60 - 432.96] cacao nibs in the morning
[430.72 - 434.16] how many guys doing that they're cacao
[432.96 - 435.76] nibs right
[434.16 - 437.84] doing your cacao nibs there's the fat
[435.76 - 439.68] again so you're putting that in your
[437.84 - 442.32] smoothies you're putting that you know
[439.68 - 443.36] in on top of your oatmeal you're mixing
[442.32 - 446.16] this in your food
[443.36 - 448.24] right and what about your cacao powder
[446.16 - 451.60] too i got some cacao powder right here
[448.24 - 453.20] right so we're taught that we need to
[451.60 - 454.48] have this in the morning have your cacao
[453.20 - 456.16] powder in the smoothie and you're not
[454.48 - 458.80] going to see that here
[456.16 - 460.16] lexi says my liver was so sluggish and i
[458.80 - 463.52] had a bad skin
[460.16 - 466.72] condition with following your info it's
[463.52 - 468.56] gone it's gone incredible
[466.72 - 469.92] so important you guys are live on
[468.56 - 471.92] facebook live on youtube
[469.92 - 473.20] live on tick tock live on clubhouse
[471.92 - 475.84] right now
[473.20 - 477.44] that's amazing that's fantastic so happy
[475.84 - 479.04] to hear so happy to hear
[477.44 - 480.56] so people are doing their chocolate in
[479.04 - 482.08] the morning cacao nibs they're doing
[480.56 - 483.12] their cacao powder they're doing in
[482.08 - 485.76] smoothies
[483.12 - 487.36] and these are what everybody's being
[485.76 - 489.20] told they're healthy fats right
[487.36 - 490.48] you got your almonds and here's your
[489.20 - 492.64] walnuts too
[490.48 - 494.08] so we got our walnuts right there
[492.64 - 496.08] another healthy fat
[494.08 - 498.32] look at that right now when it comes
[496.08 - 500.64] down to the chocolate the cacao
[498.32 - 501.84] and the cacao powder it's not a healthy
[500.64 - 504.24] fat really
[501.84 - 506.24] because basically that caffeine just
[504.24 - 508.00] annihilates any real health benefit you
[506.24 - 508.80] can get from chocolate because caffeine
[508.00 - 511.36] really just
[508.80 - 512.56] ages as quickly but there's no caffeine
[511.36 - 514.96] in walnuts
[512.56 - 516.64] so you got that so the walnut butter
[514.96 - 518.08] handful of walnuts right i mean that's
[516.64 - 520.80] not a bad thing at all
[518.08 - 522.00] but if you're doing it in the morning
[520.80 - 524.80] you won't
[522.00 - 526.16] cleanse you just won't and the medical
[524.80 - 526.80] media morning cleanse is something you
[526.16 - 529.84] can do and
[526.80 - 533.20] live your life doing so you can get
[529.84 - 534.96] back on track but here's the thing and
[533.20 - 537.28] everybody's doing other things too
[534.96 - 540.08] they're doing their bacon in the morning
[537.28 - 541.84] so they're doing their bacon right
[540.08 - 543.76] they're doing that so say someone's like
[541.84 - 545.60] well hey look i don't do any carbs i
[543.76 - 547.92] don't have the pancakes
[545.60 - 549.68] i'm on the bacon every single morning
[547.92 - 551.12] i'm on the eggs every single morning
[549.68 - 553.84] that's healthy
[551.12 - 555.20] people think that's healthy and you're
[553.84 - 557.92] just not going to cleanse
[555.20 - 558.64] you're just not so you can't cleanse the
[557.92 - 560.56] liver
[558.64 - 562.16] you can't get the toxins out of your
[560.56 - 563.68] body and i know people are worried about
[562.16 - 564.88] the lymphatic system
[563.68 - 566.40] where you're not going to be able to
[564.88 - 566.80] purge your lymphatic system if you're
[566.40 - 568.88] having
[566.80 - 570.96] fat in the morning so if you do your
[568.88 - 572.72] coconut oil and your almond butter
[570.96 - 575.12] and your peanut butter in the morning
[572.72 - 577.84] between before noon especially before
[575.12 - 580.16] noon and you're doing you're doing your
[577.84 - 581.76] cacao in the morning before noon
[580.16 - 584.24] you're not cleaning up your lymphatic
[581.76 - 585.92] system it can't clean up
[584.24 - 587.36] and you're not cleaning up the liver
[585.92 - 589.68] it's really important to know
[587.36 - 590.40] joseph says celery juice completely got
[589.68 - 594.88] rid
[590.40 - 598.96] of my see pitting
[594.88 - 601.28] derma in my legs feet and ankles
[598.96 - 602.16] and nothing else could get rid over
[601.28 - 605.52] three years
[602.16 - 607.84] of trying everything to do since
[605.52 - 609.48] being diagnosed with heart disease whoa

[619.44 - 624.40] that started appearing
[621.60 - 625.76] wow that's so good so good so important
[624.40 - 627.20] so look if you do your bacon in the
[625.76 - 629.76] morning you do your sausage you do your
[627.20 - 631.52] eggs in the morning we get in trouble
[629.76 - 633.60] that's right there say you're somebody
[631.52 - 635.04] that's that's trying to do something
[633.60 - 637.68] else like
[635.04 - 639.20] say you got your gluten-free bagel right
[637.68 - 640.56] you got your gluten-free bagel in the
[639.20 - 642.72] morning you got your
[640.56 - 644.48] organic cream cheese in the morning
[642.72 - 646.48] you're not gonna cleanse
[644.48 - 648.24] it's just not going to happen why do we
[646.48 - 650.08] have to cleanse you guys we have to get
[648.24 - 651.60] rid of poisons and toxins we got to get
[650.08 - 653.92] them out of her body every day
[651.60 - 654.88] they just build up and they wreak havoc
[653.92 - 657.36] so that when you get
[654.88 - 659.12] sick someday you don't get better no
[657.36 - 662.08] one's teaching you how to get better
[659.12 - 662.56] the reason why intermittent fasting
[662.08 - 666.16] gives
[662.56 - 666.16] people some relief
[666.24 - 671.36] is because intermittent fasting is
[668.56 - 673.84] getting rid of the fats in the morning
[671.36 - 674.56] that's why so when people intermittent
[673.84 - 675.84] fast
[674.56 - 677.04] that's everybody's being forced
[675.84 - 678.08] intermittent fast that's what's
[677.04 - 680.88] happening right now
[678.08 - 682.40] the younger generations are being forced
[680.88 - 684.24] to intermittent fast because they can't
[682.40 - 686.00] keep their weight off
[684.24 - 687.44] they can't keep their weight off their
[686.00 - 689.36] livers are all stagnant
[687.44 - 690.96] and sluggish and that's what's happening
[689.36 - 693.44] right there okay
[690.96 - 694.16] and so an intermittent fasting is not an
[693.44 - 696.72] answer
[694.16 - 699.20] it's not an answer because what happens
[696.72 - 701.44] is you blow out your adrenals when you
[699.20 - 703.76] do your intermittent fasting
[701.44 - 706.08] you blow your adrenals out that's what
[703.76 - 708.48] happens along the way keep that in mind
[706.08 - 710.24] so it's all cute it's all fun it's all
[708.48 - 710.96] games at first with the intermittent
[710.24 - 712.88] fasting
[710.96 - 714.96] wow i'm feeling a little better let me
[712.88 - 716.56] get on my let me get on my caffeine let
[714.96 - 718.40] me do that i'm intermittent fasting let
[716.56 - 721.04] me make sure i'm drinking my coffee
[718.40 - 722.32] let me do that intermittent fasting is
[721.04 - 724.56] working for me so good
[722.32 - 726.08] i'm high on coffee all day high in
[724.56 - 727.44] coffee all morning let me do my
[726.08 - 729.36] intermittent fasting
[727.44 - 731.12] i'm losing weight i'm feeling some
[729.36 - 734.72] energy back and the reason why
[731.12 - 736.80] is because you stopped doing
[734.72 - 738.64] the fats in the morning you stopped
[736.80 - 740.24] eating your eggs in the morning
[738.64 - 742.00] you stopped eating your bacon in the
[740.24 - 743.36] morning and that's what happened with
[742.00 - 744.08] the intermittent fasting it's like wait
[743.36 - 745.60] a minute
[744.08 - 747.36] intermittent fasting is like the holy
[745.60 - 748.64] grail or something but really what they
[747.36 - 750.72] don't understand
[748.64 - 753.04] is they stop eating the fats and they
[750.72 - 755.36] stop killing their liver in the morning
[753.04 - 756.84] that's what happened they stopped
[755.36 - 759.44] killing their livers
[756.84 - 761.04] and so people are being forced
[759.44 - 761.60] intermittent fast and that's not the
[761.04 - 763.52] answer
[761.60 - 764.80] this is this isn't a pro intermittent
[763.52 - 768.00] fasting deal here
[764.80 - 768.56] claudia says i was close to dying on an
[768.00 - 772.00] almost
[768.56 - 774.08] total fat diet so sick
[772.00 - 775.44] a lot of people get there with that that
[774.08 - 778.88] fat diet
[775.44 - 782.88] i almost healed i'm almost healed
[778.88 - 784.84] from about 80 long-term conditions
[782.88 - 787.68] thank you aw for saving my life
[784.84 - 787.68] incredible no problem
[788.48 - 791.84] i got a lot of lights in my eyes right
[790.08 - 793.76] now you guys from
[791.84 - 795.76] lighting in front of me the lights are
[793.76 - 798.80] so bright for some reason today
[795.76 - 801.76] so it's it's like the comments get
[798.80 - 802.08] kind of like whited out write it out but
[801.76 - 803.12] uh
[802.08 - 805.76] thanks for leaving the comments
[803.12 - 807.04] incredible intermittent fasting hurt me
[805.76 - 809.60] i just saw that
[807.04 - 811.20] so intermittent fasting what it does is
[809.60 - 813.12] it burns out the adrenals
[811.20 - 814.80] and it does hurt us over time when
[813.12 - 816.96] you're younger you can pull it off it's
[814.80 - 819.44] like just do the caffeine
[816.96 - 820.08] stay high all day long and then take
[819.44 - 822.56] that big
[820.08 - 823.44] fatty meal at the end of the day right
[822.56 - 825.44] and you'll notice
[823.44 - 827.36] you'll start to slim down a little bit
[825.44 - 829.12] your belly goes in a little bit
[827.36 - 831.84] you start to you start to lose some
[829.12 - 832.32] weight so intermittent fasting seems to
[831.84 - 835.44] be
[832.32 - 836.72] the greatest thing but it's really a
[835.44 - 839.44] mistake
[836.72 - 840.88] a bad mistake so what you do when you
[839.44 - 842.64] intermittent fast you burn out your
[840.88 - 845.92] adrenals you trash them
[842.64 - 847.76] along the way and so there's something
[845.92 - 849.04] better we can do
[847.76 - 850.80] because you can't just live on
[849.04 - 852.32] adrenaline you can't be doing this
[850.80 - 854.00] intermittent fasting and just living on
[852.32 - 855.36] adrenaline and living on adrenaline your
[854.00 - 857.52] adrenals right there
[855.36 - 859.20] right just running on adrenaline so it's
[857.52 - 861.12] like hey i'm intermittent fasting let me
[859.20 - 863.44] do a coffee coffee coffee
[861.12 - 865.28] not eating not eating not eating and
[863.44 - 867.36] matcha tea much tea not eating and just
[865.28 - 869.52] blowing out your adrenals
[867.36 - 871.12] and that's not the way to do things
[869.52 - 873.36] that's not the correct way to do things
[871.12 - 875.76] the right way to do things
[873.36 - 876.72] really important to know hi anthony
[875.76 - 880.72] please tell us
[876.72 - 884.00] what's a non-radical fat
[880.72 - 887.92] first of all steve radical fats
[884.00 - 890.16] are anything that's cranking up the fat
[887.92 - 890.80] you've got your cacao that's a radical
[890.16 - 892.80] fat
[890.80 - 895.20] you got your walnuts that's a radical
[892.80 - 896.72] fat you got your peanut butter that's a
[895.20 - 899.60] radical fat
[896.72 - 902.08] right you got your coconut oil radical
[899.60 - 903.04] fat you got your olive oil radical fat
[902.08 - 905.68] right there
[903.04 - 906.72] okay radical fat radical fat that's what
[905.68 - 909.80] all those are whoa
[906.72 - 913.28] what's this what's this
[909.80 - 916.16] avocados now what you're gonna find
[913.28 - 917.36] here is i'm not saying avocado is not
[916.16 - 920.32] good for you
[917.36 - 922.08] that's a healthy fat i like it if you
[920.32 - 923.76] guys eat avocados
[922.08 - 926.32] it because your guys are gonna eat fat
[923.76 - 928.80] anyway i'd rather have you eat avocados
[926.32 - 929.60] instead of an animal protein eggs milk
[928.80 - 932.00] cheese
[929.60 - 932.72] butter yogurt those are all radical fats
[932.00 - 935.52] by the way
[932.72 - 936.24] butter radical fat so if you're going to
[935.52 - 939.52] have a butter
[936.24 - 941.04] use avocado right but you know you've
[939.52 - 942.56] heard that before you're just you're
[941.04 - 947.60] just you've heard that before
[942.56 - 949.44] use avocado as butter okay 35 years ago
[947.60 - 950.64] i couldn't get anybody to use avocado as
[949.44 - 953.20] butter
[950.64 - 955.52] i mean i got laughed off of lecture
[953.20 - 956.40] stages for saying avocado was good for
[955.52 - 959.28] you
[956.40 - 961.04] 30 plus years ago people would be like
[959.28 - 963.52] avocados poisonous
[961.04 - 964.64] you'll get a heart attack eating avocado
[963.52 - 967.52] that's what everybody thought
[964.64 - 968.32] doctors thought avocado was toxic just
[967.52 - 969.84] so you know
[968.32 - 971.84] i said no you can use it as butter
[969.84 - 975.52] replace your butter
[971.84 - 978.32] replace your butter with avocado people
[975.52 - 979.20] that was so that was so bizarre to
[978.32 - 980.88] everybody
[979.20 - 982.48] so bizarre they couldn't handle that
[980.88 - 985.76] truth right
[982.48 - 988.00] but avocado in the morning
[985.76 - 989.20] is not going to get you strong it's not
[988.00 - 990.32] going to get you healthy it's not going
[989.20 - 991.44] to get you better it's not going to
[990.32 - 993.76] de-age you
[991.44 - 996.00] it's not going to help you got to keep
[993.76 - 1000.24] the avocados
[996.00 - 1002.80] for another time you got to keep them
[1000.24 - 1004.40] after lunch that's when you have to keep
[1002.80 - 1005.04] your avocados and avocado i want you
[1004.40 - 1007.36] guys to
[1005.04 - 1008.84] see that right there right so when
[1007.36 - 1012.00] you're doing your avocado toast in the
[1008.84 - 1013.44] morning you're not going to cleanse
[1012.00 - 1015.04] and if you're sick if you're dealing

[1028.88 - 1031.44] the morning
[1029.68 - 1032.96] you're eventually gonna get in trouble
[1031.44 - 1035.28] you're not gonna be able to heal it
[1032.96 - 1036.84] all the way you're not gonna be able to
[1035.28 - 1040.16] go to that finish
[1036.84 - 1042.64] line that finished line

[1310.80 - 1313.36] gonna survive if i can't have my eggs in
[1312.56 - 1314.96] the morning
[1313.36 - 1316.72] so we're gonna do a little potato waffle
[1314.96 - 1317.44] in a little bit let's keep on going with
[1316.72 - 1319.44] the cleanse
[1317.44 - 1321.52] you got your lemon water right there 16
[1319.44 - 1324.32] to 32 ounces of lemon water
[1321.52 - 1326.32] now we're gonna do some celery juice
[1324.32 - 1328.88] gonna run some celery real quick through
[1326.32 - 1328.88] here you guys
[1330.64 - 1336.40] here's the deal you've been taught to do
[1334.00 - 1338.80] fats since you were a child that's how
[1336.40 - 1341.84] it's done
[1338.80 - 1344.84] we're taught to crank the fats up
[1341.84 - 1346.80] lots of overt fats i call them radical
[1344.84 - 1350.16] fats
[1346.80 - 1351.76] and we feel like we can't live without
[1350.16 - 1353.04] the fat we feel like we can't live
[1351.76 - 1356.40] without it so i'm going to answer a
[1353.04 - 1356.40] couple questions that are common
[1356.48 - 1360.88] one is if i can't have my fats in the
[1359.44 - 1365.92] morning
[1360.88 - 1365.92] my peanut butter my oils
[1366.40 - 1373.92] right my walnuts my eggs
[1370.40 - 1374.48] my bacon my avocado if i can't have my
[1373.92 - 1377.60] fats
[1374.48 - 1381.20] in the morning how am i gonna keep my
[1377.60 - 1381.20] blood sugar stable
[1381.68 - 1386.40] you're having blood sugar issues the
[1384.00 - 1389.76] answer's in your hands already
[1386.40 - 1391.84] it's because of the fats it's
[1389.76 - 1392.41] because of the fats elizabeth could see
[1391.84 - 1394.08] it
[1392.41 - 1397.20] [Music]
[1394.08 - 1399.28] it's because of the fats that's why
[1397.20 - 1401.60] your blood sugar is unstable to begin
[1399.28 - 1403.12] with because your diet is so loaded in
[1401.60 - 1407.68] fat what that means is your
[1403.12 - 1410.72] pancreas is weakening
[1407.68 - 1413.60] that's what that means your pancreas
[1410.72 - 1414.80] is weakening that means your adrenals
[1413.60 - 1419.36] are weakening
[1414.80 - 1422.32] if you got blood sugar problems
[1419.36 - 1423.76] that's because you've had insulin
[1422.32 - 1427.20] resistance
[1423.76 - 1429.68] for years you guys
[1427.20 - 1430.80] so if you're someone that's scared to
[1429.68 - 1434.16] death
[1430.80 - 1436.24] of going fat free in the morning or fat
[1434.16 - 1437.52] free during a day because you think
[1436.24 - 1439.84] you're gonna have blood sugar
[1437.52 - 1442.72] instability
[1439.84 - 1443.28] then you're someone that already has a
[1442.72 - 1447.12] weak
[1443.28 - 1449.84] pancreas from fats
[1447.12 - 1451.20] see what i mean you're already getting
[1449.84 - 1454.80] injured
[1451.20 - 1458.32] from your high fat diet and that's
[1454.80 - 1460.48] how it rolls
[1458.32 - 1462.32] if you're dealing with that if you're at
[1460.48 - 1464.24] the doctor's office the doctor's like
[1462.32 - 1466.72] well you got hypoglycemia you've got
[1464.24 - 1469.92] blood sugar instability here
[1466.72 - 1474.08] you've got a little insulin resistance
[1469.92 - 1478.40] you got your a1c is is moving around
[1474.08 - 1482.32] you're not stable you're already injured
[1478.40 - 1485.44] from living off of fats you're already
[1482.32 - 1486.32] hurting from all the fats yeah healthy
[1485.44 - 1489.12] fats too
[1486.32 - 1490.56] the avocados right the bacon the eggs
[1489.12 - 1493.76] which aren't healthy fats
[1490.56 - 1495.76] the nuts and nut butters cat beard
[1493.76 - 1498.08] says that is true explanation points
[1495.76 - 1501.20] when i started eating fruit and veggies
[1498.08 - 1504.08] and cut out the fats i felt so much
[1501.20 - 1504.80] better and quickly i stopped having what
[1504.08 - 1508.48] i thought
[1504.80 - 1510.32] were hypoglycemic episodes it means the
[1508.48 - 1512.40] fats you've been consuming all these
[1510.32 - 1516.24] years
[1512.40 - 1519.04] are starting to beat down the pancreas
[1516.24 - 1520.40] starting to take out the pancreas that's
[1519.04 - 1522.88] what it means
[1520.40 - 1524.56] regina says i've been doing that morning
[1522.88 - 1527.28] cleanse for almost three years
[1524.56 - 1528.28] and cannot live without it i used to
[1527.28 - 1531.76] suffer from
[1528.28 - 1535.12] hypoglycemia and it's all normal now
[1531.76 - 1535.12] thanks to you and spirit
[1536.08 - 1543.28] that's how it rolls so look you guys
[1539.60 - 1545.76] what i've noticed is
[1543.28 - 1547.84] once people learn this information once
[1545.76 - 1549.76] they actually learn the information
[1547.84 - 1552.40] it's endless what they can do and that's
[1549.76 - 1554.88] what they can do get their lives back
[1552.40 - 1556.00] medical medium information is about
[1554.88 - 1559.04] results
[1556.00 - 1560.24] like the real results not the smoke and
[1559.04 - 1561.52] mirror ones
[1560.24 - 1563.36] that are out there in the health
[1561.52 - 1565.52] movement
[1563.36 - 1566.72] suzanne says i used to have gluten-free
[1565.52 - 1571.12] toast
[1566.72 - 1574.56] with cheese and a poached egg every day
[1571.12 - 1575.36] on the on the brain fog whoa oh the
[1574.56 - 1579.20] brain fog
[1575.36 - 1581.60] wow now lwcj
[1579.20 - 1583.12] heavy metal detox movie and zero brain
[1581.60 - 1585.52] fog now so you're doing the cj you're
[1583.12 - 1588.88] doing the heavy metal detox smoothie
[1585.52 - 1592.72] incredible incredible brain fog
[1588.88 - 1594.88] gone amazing that's incredible it really
[1592.72 - 1594.88] is
[1595.44 - 1599.68] so when people don't realize you guys is
[1598.08 - 1601.60] they're living with insulin resistance
[1599.68 - 1604.00] every single day
[1601.60 - 1605.20] every single day for living with insulin
[1604.00 - 1607.28] resistance
[1605.20 - 1608.48] that's what they're up against insulin
[1607.28 - 1611.28] resistance is
[1608.48 - 1612.24] the big one right there their pancreas
[1611.28 - 1614.40] is maxed out
[1612.24 - 1617.20] every single day their pancreas is
[1614.40 - 1619.76] hurting every single day
[1617.20 - 1621.12] this is a we're in like part of the
[1619.76 - 1623.20] medical meeting morning puns right now
[1621.12 - 1626.00] i'm doing a little celery juice
[1623.20 - 1626.88] i didn't do celery juice yet today
[1626.00 - 1630.24] anyway
[1626.88 - 1631.36] so this is great i'm excited
[1630.24 - 1634.00] i was like you know what i'll do it
[1631.36 - 1636.40] later on i'll have some celery juice
[1634.00 - 1640.00] later on
[1636.40 - 1643.76] so insulin resistance
[1640.00 - 1645.92] means your pancreas and your adrenals
[1643.76 - 1648.72] are getting weak it also means your
[1645.92 - 1649.28] liver is stagnant sluggish and getting
[1648.72 - 1650.88] weak
[1649.28 - 1652.56] and i don't know why anybody would want
[1650.88 - 1654.32] that maybe they just don't know they
[1652.56 - 1655.92] have it right maybe they just don't know
[1654.32 - 1658.48] they have the problem
[1655.92 - 1660.24] but they do they do have it so we're
[1658.48 - 1662.56] going to do some celery juice constraint
[1660.24 - 1664.88] you have to strain the celery juice
[1662.56 - 1666.80] it's critical you got to get all the
[1664.88 - 1667.52] pulp out you got to get all the fiber
[1666.80 - 1670.00] out right
[1667.52 - 1670.56] i still get blown away at this at this
[1670.00 - 1672.88] machine
[1670.56 - 1674.40] you know the pulp is dry it's in my
[1672.88 - 1676.32] hands right here it's a little bit of
[1674.40 - 1678.80] pulp it's nice and dry
[1676.32 - 1681.52] i just love that what that means if you
[1678.80 - 1682.00] guys have the mm-900 hds it's only this
[1681.52 - 1684.00] machine
[1682.00 - 1686.48] just so you know this specific machine
[1684.00 - 1688.88] but boy it's just so great
[1686.48 - 1690.48] saving money every time i juice celery
[1688.88 - 1692.64] it's i like doing the medical medium
[1690.48 - 1694.24] morning cleanse knowing i'm saving money
[1692.64 - 1697.68] that's a whole other thing too knowing
[1694.24 - 1700.64] my juicer is paying for itself

[1997.12 - 2001.04] out there
[1998.64 - 2002.40] it's hard to think of it's hard for one
[2001.04 - 2004.88] thing okay

[2008.48 - 2011.68] interesting so
[2009.76 - 2013.44] nobody knew metals caused anxiety or

[2018.40 - 2021.68] let's listen to someone who says try
[2020.16 - 2024.00] some charcoal when they didn't even know
[2021.68 - 2025.44] metals caused any condition whatsoever
[2024.00 - 2027.44] it's kind of interesting when you think
[2025.44 - 2028.00] about it right someone can be all of a
[2027.44 - 2030.48] sudden
[2028.00 - 2032.40] a heavy metal expert when they didn't
[2030.48 - 2033.04] even know a condition is caused by
[2032.40 - 2035.28] metals
[2033.04 - 2037.20] that's a tough one right there on it so
[2035.28 - 2040.64] the only way to get the metals out
[2037.20 - 2042.24] okay is making sure you got the wild
[2040.64 - 2044.72] blueberries in there which we did
[2042.24 - 2046.16] i got some dolls so it's a nice bowl of
[2044.72 - 2047.44] dolls right there doing the heavy metal
[2046.16 - 2050.80] detox smoothie
[2047.44 - 2053.20] right cilantro okay
[2050.80 - 2055.44] cilantro is critical that's atlantic
[2053.20 - 2058.72] dolce gotta have your cilantro in there
[2055.44 - 2060.32] put a little bit of that right and
[2058.72 - 2063.04] i'm gonna put a little extra wild
[2060.32 - 2066.00] blueberry powder
[2063.04 - 2067.92] it's one cup of cilantro by the way so
[2066.00 - 2070.24] i'm gonna put a little bit of the
[2067.92 - 2071.20] the um a little bit of wild blueberry
[2070.24 - 2074.88] powder
[2071.20 - 2077.52] so what i'm gonna do now
[2074.88 - 2077.52] let's do that
[2079.04 - 2081.28] so
[2084.64 - 2089.84] let's get that in there i like to put a
[2087.12 - 2089.84] little extra
[2090.32 - 2095.44] doing that barley grass juice powder
[2094.00 - 2096.64] that's another great way of getting the
[2095.44 - 2098.16] metals out you have to have the five
[2096.64 - 2098.56] ingredients and if you don't have the
[2098.16 - 2100.32] full
[2098.56 - 2102.00] five ingredients and you have three out
[2100.32 - 2104.40] of the five you can get some
[2102.00 - 2105.12] metals out i like having five out of the
[2104.40 - 2106.80] five
[2105.12 - 2108.96] that's the way to really accelerate it
[2106.80 - 2110.56] quicker right now i have the capsules i
[2108.96 - 2114.16] just ran out of the powder
[2110.56 - 2114.56] this is the vimergy brand b is in victor
[2114.16 - 2117.04] i
[2114.56 - 2117.04] am as in
[2118.48 - 2123.12] so i'm putting in a couple of capsules
[2121.84 - 2127.20] in here i'm putting in about
[2123.12 - 2131.12] a teaspoon of barley grass juice powder
[2127.20 - 2135.36] so we got that going in there right
[2131.12 - 2139.36] and i'm gonna pop in some spirulina
[2135.36 - 2139.36] right there spirulina's critical
[2139.68 - 2142.88] for getting the metals out
[2143.36 - 2147.72] and you can find these supplements at
[2145.20 - 2150.24] the mm directory medical meme directory
[2147.72 - 2151.28] medicalmedium.com but it's the vimergy
[2150.24 - 2154.56] products that's the best
[2151.28 - 2156.88] there is out there by far hands down
[2154.56 - 2158.80] quality is unmatched so we have the
[2156.88 - 2160.80] spirulina we have the barley grass juice
[2158.80 - 2162.64] powder we got the cilantro we've got the
[2160.80 - 2163.04] wild blueberries now bananas in there
[2162.64 - 2164.64] because it
[2163.04 - 2167.44] gives you more glucose because you need
[2164.64 - 2169.12] glucose to get the metals out too
[2167.44 - 2170.88] that's really important all it's all on
[2169.12 - 2173.20] its own we got the dulce in there
[2170.88 - 2175.92] atlantic dolls right
[2173.20 - 2177.28] so there we go i'm gonna put the lid on
[2175.92 - 2178.48] this you can add a little bit of water
[2177.28 - 2180.32] you can add a little bit of coconut
[2178.48 - 2182.96] water to it too
[2180.32 - 2183.68] right and i think i got everything in
[2182.96 - 2185.44] there you guys
[2183.68 - 2187.44] we can do a little blending is what
[2185.44 - 2189.20] we'll do
[2187.44 - 2190.72] you can blend it sometimes without oh
[2189.20 - 2192.56] yeah i got to have the orange in there
[2190.72 - 2194.64] that's the part that is
[2192.56 - 2195.76] good old orange right there that's the
[2194.64 - 2197.68] part
[2195.76 - 2199.36] a lot of moving parts today a lot of
[2197.68 - 2203.04] stuff on my plate
[2199.36 - 2203.04] so i'm gonna squeeze some orange in here
[2203.92 - 2207.76] you got your vitamin c you can use a
[2206.64 - 2208.88] little bit of coconut water if you
[2207.76 - 2211.76] really like
[2208.88 - 2212.96] you have that option as well you guys
[2211.76 - 2215.12] just got on here we're in the medical
[2212.96 - 2218.40] media morning cleanse challenge

[2233.60 - 2235.92] of
[2234.16 - 2237.44] juice that comes from it's unmatched
[2235.92 - 2238.40] there's no juicer that matches it in my
[2237.44 - 2240.40] opinion
[2238.40 - 2241.76] lily says can you put a cup of orange
[2240.40 - 2244.56] juice in there yes you can
[2241.76 - 2245.68] definitely can lily you can i squeezed
[2244.56 - 2249.44] an orange in there

[2431.20 - 2436.72] tell you guys
[2433.12 - 2440.16] i'm excited getting better
[2436.72 - 2442.32] is exciting getting better
[2440.16 - 2445.28] is a great thing so i'm popping some of
[2442.32 - 2447.28] the skins off of this right here okay
[2445.28 - 2449.36] so what i'm doing is i'm taking some of
[2447.28 - 2450.88] these potato skins off you don't have to
[2449.36 - 2453.12] take them off if you don't want to for
[2450.88 - 2456.24] your waffles
[2453.12 - 2459.76] potatoes become a problem
[2456.24 - 2463.04] when you mix oil fat nut butter in there
[2459.76 - 2463.76] grease when you stick eggs in there when
[2463.04 - 2467.36] you stick
[2463.76 - 2467.68] when you stick um any kind of oil in
[2467.36 - 2470.80] there
[2467.68 - 2472.40] butter cheese on a potato then
[2470.80 - 2474.32] potato is a problem but it's not
[2472.40 - 2475.84] necessarily a problem it's the butter
[2474.32 - 2477.52] that's a problem it's the cheese that's
[2475.84 - 2478.32] the problem and that's where the problem
[2477.52 - 2480.72] really lies
[2478.32 - 2481.60] i'm gonna make potato waffles it's a
[2480.72 - 2484.72] great one
[2481.60 - 2485.12] i really like potato waffles um i think
[2484.72 - 2487.76] it's
[2485.12 - 2490.08] what happens is it it's shocking for a
[2487.76 - 2491.60] lot of people to do
[2490.08 - 2493.20] say a morning cleanse where they're
[2491.60 - 2494.48] doing celery juice and they're doing
[2493.20 - 2496.72] lemon water
[2494.48 - 2498.56] and they're doing the heavy metal detox
[2496.72 - 2499.84] smoothie it might be hard for somebody
[2498.56 - 2502.56] to imagine
[2499.84 - 2504.00] that that's going to get them by so many
[2502.56 - 2505.20] people i know that if they're just
[2504.00 - 2507.20] starting out too they're going to be
[2505.20 - 2508.72] like i need something more hearty i need
[2507.20 - 2511.28] something more satiating because i'm
[2508.72 - 2514.00] used to three four eggs in the morning
[2511.28 - 2516.24] aw so what are you gonna do for me then
[2514.00 - 2520.08] cause i'm used to a whole bunch of eggs
[2516.24 - 2522.16] i'm used to like toast i'm saying well
[2520.08 - 2523.84] why don't we do some waffles and what
[2522.16 - 2525.28] you're going to find with the waffles
[2523.84 - 2526.24] these ones right here is you're going to
[2525.28 - 2529.60] find they're fat
[2526.24 - 2532.24] free that's the key to avoiding
[2529.60 - 2534.56] insulin resistance that's the key to not
[2532.24 - 2536.40] getting your blood sugar unstable if
[2534.56 - 2539.44] your blood sugar is unstable
[2536.40 - 2540.92] and your hypoglycemia happening or
[2539.44 - 2542.56] you're hypoglycemic or you're
[2540.92 - 2544.56] hyperglycemic
[2542.56 - 2547.12] then you've got a pancreas problem and
[2544.56 - 2549.44] you're on the edge of diabetes
[2547.12 - 2551.36] because your pancreas is basically
[2549.44 - 2554.08] saying you know what i'm done
[2551.36 - 2554.80] you fat at me to death i'm giving up
[2554.08 - 2557.60] soon
[2554.80 - 2559.52] so that's how it works okay so doing
[2557.60 - 2561.84] this can save pancreases i can't tell
[2559.52 - 2564.88] you how many pancreases have been saved
[2561.84 - 2566.72] through medical medium protocols so i
[2564.88 - 2568.24] think a pancreas is worth saving what do
[2566.72 - 2569.92] you guys think on clubhouse you think a
[2568.24 - 2571.68] pancreas is worth saving
[2569.92 - 2574.08] what do you guys think on tick tock
[2571.68 - 2575.76] pancreas is worth saving
[2574.08 - 2577.60] here's what happens when you get insulin
[2575.76 - 2579.20] resistance this is important information
[2577.60 - 2580.88] while i'm peeling these potatoes right
[2579.20 - 2582.56] here these beautiful potatoes these are
[2580.88 - 2584.72] steamed potatoes they're already cooked
[2582.56 - 2586.80] they're steamed
[2584.72 - 2589.36] what happens is that glucose is how you
[2586.80 - 2592.56] get your nutrients
[2589.36 - 2594.32] into your cells if that's in the way
[2592.56 - 2595.68] you can't get glucose into your cells
[2594.32 - 2597.04] easy and you can't get all your
[2595.68 - 2599.20] nutrients into your cells
[2597.04 - 2601.52] you can be taking all your your your
[2599.20 - 2602.64] supplements from your practitioners you
[2601.52 - 2604.40] can take all your
[2602.64 - 2606.56] all your different supplements all your
[2604.40 - 2608.32] different stuff and what happens is
[2606.56 - 2610.08] you can you're spending all this money
[2608.32 - 2611.76] on all your supplementation
[2610.08 - 2613.68] and it's not getting to where it needs
[2611.76 - 2617.20] to go you have to have
[2613.68 - 2620.24] sugar take in a nutrient into a cell
[2617.20 - 2620.88] you can't have a nutrient enter your
[2620.24 - 2624.40] cells
[2620.88 - 2626.08] unless sugar's driving it in and then if
[2624.40 - 2627.76] you're tanking the fats
[2626.08 - 2629.12] you got the eggs you got the bacon you
[2627.76 - 2630.72] got the nut butters in the morning you
[2629.12 - 2631.36] got the avocado toast in the morning
[2630.72 - 2633.44] you're not gonna
[2631.36 - 2634.88] you can if you're in the morning you
[2633.44 - 2636.24] keep on taking your supplements in the
[2634.88 - 2638.00] morning right let me take all my
[2636.24 - 2639.68] multivitamins my gut health products
[2638.00 - 2640.32] supplements my probiotics let me take
[2639.68 - 2643.84] everything
[2640.32 - 2645.76] i'm taking let me take all my my calcium
[2643.84 - 2646.88] let me take let me get all it in the
[2645.76 - 2648.24] morning right
[2646.88 - 2650.00] when you do that and you're still having
[2648.24 - 2652.00] your avocado toast let me kind of have
[2650.00 - 2655.36] my avocado toast with it too
[2652.00 - 2658.08] if you do that what's going to happen is
[2655.36 - 2659.20] only a fraction a tiny fraction of the
[2658.08 - 2660.00] supplements are ever going to get
[2659.20 - 2663.04] anywhere
[2660.00 - 2664.00] only a tiny fraction of those
[2663.04 - 2666.32] supplements
[2664.00 - 2667.60] are going to get anywhere into your
[2666.32 - 2670.08] cells because
[2667.60 - 2671.92] the fat from the avocado toast even
[2670.08 - 2673.52] though avocados are healthy fat
[2671.92 - 2675.12] even though it's a healthy fat the fat
[2673.52 - 2678.32] from the avocado toast
[2675.12 - 2680.40] won't allow the sugar to drive in all
[2678.32 - 2683.12] those nutrients into your cells
[2680.40 - 2684.16] do you see how it works and this is
[2683.12 - 2685.92] important to know
[2684.16 - 2687.44] so i'm just mashing up these potatoes
[2685.92 - 2690.24] right here okay
[2687.44 - 2692.32] that's what i'm doing here's an option
[2690.24 - 2693.84] you can do oatmeal in the morning
[2692.32 - 2695.68] you can do that if you're somebody
[2693.84 - 2697.76] that's like whoa i can't exist on the
[2695.68 - 2698.96] heavy metal detox smoothie i can't exist
[2697.76 - 2700.80] on a celery juice
[2698.96 - 2702.16] in the morning i can't do this medical
[2700.80 - 2704.56] medium morning cleanse
[2702.16 - 2705.76] i need something denser because you've
[2704.56 - 2708.00] been trained
[2705.76 - 2710.24] in such a way to have something much
[2708.00 - 2712.40] more denser right
[2710.24 - 2714.32] and your oatmeal usually has butter in
[2712.40 - 2716.08] it it usually has peanut butter in it it
[2714.32 - 2716.48] has nut butters it has nut milk in it
[2716.08 - 2719.04] right
[2716.48 - 2721.28] so then you feel satiated you feel like
[2719.04 - 2724.32] you're keeping your blood sugar balanced
[2721.28 - 2724.56] but it's smoking mirrors your pancreas
[2724.32 - 2726.48] is
[2724.56 - 2728.72] it's throwing out that insulin it's
[2726.48 - 2730.16] killing itself to throw out that insulin
[2728.72 - 2732.56] when you have all that fat with your
[2730.16 - 2735.68] oatmeal so what you can do you guys
[2732.56 - 2737.36] you can have fat free oatmeal oatmeal
[2735.68 - 2738.96] itself has fat inside of it
[2737.36 - 2741.12] every single fruit and vegetable has fat
[2738.96 - 2744.48] inside of it everything does
[2741.12 - 2744.88] fat is in everything but added fat overt
[2744.48 - 2747.44] fat
[2744.88 - 2749.60] radical fat adding it is another story
[2747.44 - 2751.84] you can have your oatmeal without adding
[2749.60 - 2753.44] avocado without adding nut butters
[2751.84 - 2756.72] without adding nut milks
[2753.44 - 2759.60] you can have your
[2756.72 - 2761.52] oatmeal without adding anything right
[2759.60 - 2763.28] i'm making a lot of waffle mix right now
[2761.52 - 2764.88] this is way more than i know that waffle
[2763.28 - 2768.80] maker can take
[2764.88 - 2768.80] so i'm just mashing up a lot right here
[2769.36 - 2776.88] so this information okay
[2772.64 - 2779.04] is priceless just that tip alone
[2776.88 - 2779.92] is worth the price of admission to this
[2779.04 - 2783.76] free
[2779.92 - 2786.48] medical medium morning cleanse challenge
[2783.76 - 2788.40] there are no tickets there is no price
[2786.48 - 2791.28] for admission here
[2788.40 - 2792.72] the bottom line is when you're fat free
[2791.28 - 2794.40] in the morning if you do some oatmeal
[2792.72 - 2795.52] you can do some millet that's an option
[2794.40 - 2798.64] right there
[2795.52 - 2800.16] now here's here's a trick to learn don't
[2798.64 - 2803.36] do the dried
[2800.16 - 2806.56] fruit in the morning
[2803.36 - 2809.12] don't do the dried fruit it takes a lot
[2806.56 - 2810.00] for the body to extract the sugar and
[2809.12 - 2813.28] break it down
[2810.00 - 2815.52] out of dried fruit it's not living water
[2813.28 - 2818.32] you can't flush the liver easy
[2815.52 - 2820.40] with dried fruit in the morning yes you
[2818.32 - 2822.72] can have it if it's all you got
[2820.40 - 2824.40] if all you got is some raisins it's all
[2822.72 - 2826.64] you have
[2824.40 - 2827.52] yep you can have it in the morning but i
[2826.64 - 2829.92] recommend not
[2827.52 - 2831.36] i recommend keeping your dried fruit out
[2829.92 - 2835.20] of your morning
[2831.36 - 2835.20] you know i mean that's what i recommend
[2835.28 - 2838.56] so just mashing some potatoes right now
[2837.36 - 2841.44] because we're going to make some waffles
[2838.56 - 2846.56] and we've got some maple syrup here too
[2841.44 - 2849.12] maple syrup is beneficial
[2846.56 - 2850.80] when there's no fat and butter there's
[2849.12 - 2853.44] no butter involved
[2850.80 - 2855.36] so maple syrup has a problem when
[2853.44 - 2858.00] there's butter involved so here's how it
[2855.36 - 2860.32] works right
[2858.00 - 2861.76] so i got some pancakes right there okay
[2860.32 - 2862.48] you see maple syrup on top of the
[2861.76 - 2865.76] pancake
[2862.48 - 2867.12] but you also see a pat of butter on top
[2865.76 - 2870.56] of the pancake
[2867.12 - 2871.76] it's the butter and the maple syrup
[2870.56 - 2874.24] together
[2871.76 - 2876.16] that become the problem right there
[2874.24 - 2878.08] maple syrup's great
[2876.16 - 2879.52] may we need maple syrup to get into our
[2878.08 - 2880.32] cells we need honey to get into our
[2879.52 - 2882.08] cells
[2880.32 - 2884.72] right we need fruit to get into our
[2882.08 - 2886.80] cells but what happens is the butter
[2884.72 - 2888.56] stops it from working and then our
[2886.80 - 2889.76] pancreas is spilling out all this
[2888.56 - 2892.80] insulin
[2889.76 - 2893.84] and the butter gets in the way keep it
[2892.80 - 2896.56] fat free in the morning
[2893.84 - 2898.32] guys this information is so important
[2896.56 - 2900.72] all right so

[3168.64 - 3176.72] being healthy keto clean animal protein
[3173.28 - 3180.88] carb free is not an answer it's not an
[3176.72 - 3184.56] answer being carnivore not an answer
[3180.88 - 3187.36] it's not being pescetarian
[3184.56 - 3188.40] is not an answer it's not being
[3187.36 - 3191.76] vegetarian
[3188.40 - 3193.84] is not an answer it's not
[3191.76 - 3195.84] there's still bugs in everybody's system
[3193.84 - 3197.20] no one knows how to clean them out
[3195.84 - 3199.04] they're still toxic heavy metals in
[3197.20 - 3200.80] everybody's system their livers can
[3199.04 - 3202.96] still be stagnant and sluggish
[3200.80 - 3203.84] in everybody's system you can be
[3202.96 - 3205.60] plant-based
[3203.84 - 3207.68] and your liver be still stagnant and
[3205.60 - 3210.72] sluggish and stuck

[3216.32 - 3218.80] are it's all fat in the plant-based
[3218.24 - 3220.32] movement

[3267.12 - 3270.56] morning
[3268.08 - 3271.68] get them blended up so you're not

[3271.68 - 3275.92] all you know all thick and pasty right
[3274.64 - 3277.36] and concentrated
[3275.92 - 3278.96] throw the dates in the smoothie and

[3478.48 - 3482.96] okay uh science research is only
[3481.20 - 3485.12] stealing all medical mediums information
[3482.96 - 3488.40] about why people have chronic illness
[3485.12 - 3489.92] uh okay uh you know after it's been
[3488.40 - 3492.08] published by medical medium
[3489.92 - 3493.44] it's just one out of a million examples
[3492.08 - 3495.20] uh no i don't know anything about the
[3493.44 - 3498.16] lymphatic system well let me just
[3495.20 - 3500.32] give you a little bit of insight if
[3498.16 - 3502.56] you're not working on your liver
[3500.32 - 3503.76] your lymphatic system is just that's
[3502.56 - 3505.76] just a non-issue
[3503.76 - 3507.36] either way you can't just work on your
[3505.76 - 3507.76] lymphatic system you got to work on your
[3507.36 - 3508.88] liver
[3507.76 - 3510.40] if you don't clean up your liver your
[3508.88 - 3511.60] lymphatic system is going to perpetually
[3510.40 - 3513.28] stay dirty
[3511.60 - 3514.80] perpetually dirty okay go ahead go get
[3513.28 - 3516.00] your lymphatic massage every single day

[3518.16 - 3521.04] on your lymphatic system keep on working
[3519.84 - 3522.64] on it but guess what

[3524.56 - 3527.04] you're just you're going to be in a
[3525.68 - 3528.64] phantom world of thinking you're

[3528.64 - 3531.84] your liver is still clogged and dirty
[3530.48 - 3533.28] and someone's not going to teach you how
[3531.84 - 3534.48] to clean up that liver so you're never
[3533.28 - 3537.04] going to get your lymphatic system
[3534.48 - 3538.80] better and that's how it's going to roll

[3681.12 - 3687.20] sponsored by those guys
[3683.76 - 3690.16] the lymphatic system is not your gut

[3695.84 - 3702.32] something looking forward to that
[3698.48 - 3704.32] uh great md incredible md so
[3702.32 - 3706.72] what happens is that people have to
[3704.32 - 3707.44] understand is that your lymphatic system
[3706.72 - 3710.16] is not
[3707.44 - 3710.80] your gut gut okay yeah it wraps around
[3710.16 - 3712.88] your gut
[3710.80 - 3715.76] all your torso it goes down into your
[3712.88 - 3717.92] thighs it goes into your armpits your
[3715.76 - 3719.76] lymphatic system travels everywhere
[3717.92 - 3721.60] and the majority of your lymphatic
[3719.76 - 3723.92] system is the center
[3721.60 - 3725.60] of your body so everybody says oh well
[3723.92 - 3727.84] the gut's where all your immune system
[3725.60 - 3730.00] is but first of all
[3727.84 - 3732.00] that that's completely wrong how that
[3730.00 - 3733.84] works your immune system is all in your
[3732.00 - 3734.72] bloodstream the second place your immune
[3733.84 - 3736.16] system is
[3734.72 - 3737.92] is your spleen the third place your
[3736.16 - 3740.32] immune system is
[3737.92 - 3741.92] right is your lymphatic system your
[3740.32 - 3742.80] bones that's a place for your immune
[3741.92 - 3744.72] system too
[3742.80 - 3746.80] so it's all these other options but the
[3744.72 - 3748.56] bloodstream is where the majority of
[3746.80 - 3751.60] your immune system is at
[3748.56 - 3753.92] it's in your bloodstream okay and
[3751.60 - 3755.28] the what they confuse everybody with
[3753.92 - 3756.96] everybody thinks i'm going to take a
[3755.28 - 3758.24] probiotic because the immune system's
[3756.96 - 3759.84] all in my gut but what they don't
[3758.24 - 3761.44] understand it's not in the lining of
[3759.84 - 3762.16] your intestinal tract so your immune
[3761.44 - 3765.12] system
[3762.16 - 3766.64] is not in the lining of your intestinal
[3765.12 - 3767.44] tract you got to know that your immune
[3766.64 - 3769.68] system is not
[3767.44 - 3772.00] inside your colon so i'm going to remove
[3769.68 - 3774.64] a part of this colon right here
[3772.00 - 3775.60] let me remove this okay see if it can
[3774.64 - 3778.64] come out
[3775.60 - 3780.08] stomach came out the liver just came out
[3778.64 - 3782.00] hey we got a liver in our hands that's
[3780.08 - 3784.40] good i'm going to need that for a second
[3782.00 - 3786.32] talk about that most of your immune
[3784.40 - 3790.16] system is in your bloodstream
[3786.32 - 3791.76] this alone kind of makes everything just
[3790.16 - 3794.08] fall apart out there
[3791.76 - 3795.20] you wonder why years of alternative
[3794.08 - 3797.52] medicine
[3795.20 - 3798.40] and nobody getting better that's what
[3797.52 - 3800.00] happened out there
[3798.40 - 3801.44] i watched it for decades years of
[3800.00 - 3802.96] alternative medicine people saying you
[3801.44 - 3805.12] got candida women
[3802.96 - 3806.40] being carried into doctor's offices
[3805.12 - 3807.60] because their fatigue was so bad they
[3806.40 - 3809.92] couldn't even speak
[3807.60 - 3811.60] or sit up and they'd be like you got
[3809.92 - 3814.32] candida that's why you're that sick
[3811.60 - 3815.84] years of women suffering right and then
[3814.32 - 3817.20] here we go the greatest alternative
[3815.84 - 3819.92] medicine we have now
[3817.20 - 3821.52] out there the greatest altar in medicine
[3819.92 - 3822.96] so-called experts out there your immune
[3821.52 - 3824.00] system is all in your gut let's just
[3822.96 - 3827.12] brainscrew everybody
[3824.00 - 3829.60] and confuse everybody inside here
[3827.12 - 3831.28] right inside your colon is not your
[3829.60 - 3833.84] immune cells
[3831.28 - 3835.60] that's not your immune cells so that's
[3833.84 - 3837.52] where they're just messing everybody up
[3835.60 - 3839.04] so you can buy all their gut health
[3837.52 - 3842.16] products make sure you do that
[3839.04 - 3842.56] by all their gut health products all
[3842.16 - 3843.92] that
[3842.56 - 3846.32] because you think you're building your
[3843.92 - 3847.28] immune system up all your probiotics all
[3846.32 - 3849.44] your
[3847.28 - 3851.20] your gut flora products that's what
[3849.44 - 3852.56] they're teaching you
[3851.20 - 3854.64] right they say because your immune
[3852.56 - 3858.08] system's all in your gut
[3854.64 - 3861.20] they don't tell you because
[3858.08 - 3862.64] maybe they don't even know that that's
[3861.20 - 3864.08] not where your immune system is
[3862.64 - 3865.68] not inside your intestinal tract it's
[3864.08 - 3868.00] not inside your stomach it's not inside
[3865.68 - 3871.20] your colon it's not inside your duodenum
[3868.00 - 3872.56] it's not inside there your immune system
[3871.20 - 3874.56] yeah you have an immune system inside
[3872.56 - 3876.80] your lymphatic system
[3874.56 - 3879.20] and that wraps around your torso wraps
[3876.80 - 3880.64] around your organs and your torso yeah
[3879.20 - 3882.56] the majority of your immune system is in
[3880.64 - 3884.56] your bloodstream and that enters every
[3882.56 - 3886.24] single organ every single blood vessel
[3884.56 - 3888.24] there is in the body to make sure you
[3886.24 - 3890.96] don't get sepsis and die
[3888.24 - 3892.48] that's the immune system yeah there's a
[3890.96 - 3893.92] lot of immune system in your lymphatic
[3892.48 - 3895.84] system but let's be straight out and
[3893.92 - 3897.76] i'll call it the lymphatic system let's
[3895.84 - 3899.36] not make everybody think you can swallow
[3897.76 - 3900.80] a probiotic and for some reason you're
[3899.36 - 3902.96] going to have an immune system develop
[3900.80 - 3906.16] inside your colon
[3902.96 - 3907.52] it doesn't work okay it doesn't work
[3906.16 - 3909.84] like that
[3907.52 - 3909.84] so
[3911.44 - 3916.40] the misinformation is so great out there
[3914.48 - 3917.84] that there's nowhere to see like there's
[3916.40 - 3919.92] no way to escape it
[3917.84 - 3921.76] there's so much misinformation just the
[3919.92 - 3925.12] simple simplicity of this one
[3921.76 - 3926.64] the chickenpox virus is the shingles
[3925.12 - 3927.68] virus no it's not they're two separate
[3926.64 - 3929.60] viruses
[3927.68 - 3931.60] so if we have a medical system that
[3929.60 - 3933.04] can't get one thing right
[3931.60 - 3934.72] alternative and conventional how is
[3933.04 - 3936.24] anybody gonna see straight
[3934.72 - 3938.48] where's the sensibility going to be
[3936.24 - 3939.68] where's where's any of it going to be
[3938.48 - 3941.12] we're on the mo we're in the morning
[3939.68 - 3942.96] cleanse right here give me a recap i'm
[3941.12 - 3943.68] cooking some fat-free waffles right now
[3942.96 - 3945.36] here you guys
[3943.68 - 3946.64] which is really cool radical fat-free i
[3945.36 - 3948.00] talked about the radical fats a
[3946.64 - 3949.44] different kind of radical fats milk
[3948.00 - 3952.64] cheese butter eggs
[3949.44 - 3955.68] fish meat chicken bone broth
[3952.64 - 3958.48] those are all radical fats nuts seeds
[3955.68 - 3960.40] nut butters peanut butter olive oil all
[3958.48 - 3962.64] radical fats coconut oil all radical
[3960.40 - 3965.76] fats i talked about that
[3962.64 - 3968.96] we're keeping all of that out
[3965.76 - 3971.20] important now lemon water 16 to 32
[3968.96 - 3972.64] ounces you can do some coconut water
[3971.20 - 3974.32] in the morning that's cooking the water
[3972.64 - 3975.60] in here right there
[3974.32 - 3977.68] you could do some coconut water in the
[3975.60 - 3979.28] morning if you want to but let's do the
[3977.68 - 3981.20] traditional medical medium morning
[3979.28 - 3984.08] cleanse right upon waking
[3981.20 - 3984.88] 16 to 32 ounces of lemon water upon
[3984.08 - 3988.88] waking
[3984.88 - 3991.28] wait at least 15 to 30 minutes then
[3988.88 - 3992.00] work on that celery juice 16 to 32
[3991.28 - 3993.60] ounces of straight
[3992.00 - 3996.00] celery juice because you want those
[3993.60 - 3998.64] mineral salts the sodium cluster salts
[3996.00 - 4000.00] to bind onto the toxins to get into the
[3998.64 - 4003.12] liver
[4000.00 - 4006.48] and do what they need to do
[4003.12 - 4008.88] you want that you can consume fruits
[4006.48 - 4010.88] after 15 to 30 minutes after your celery
[4008.88 - 4013.36] juice you can consume fruits
[4010.88 - 4015.84] which you can which is an example right
[4013.36 - 4017.68] here here's a fruit bowl papaya banana
[4015.84 - 4020.48] right in my hands
[4017.68 - 4021.04] crack open some oranges do that if you
[4020.48 - 4024.08] need to
[4021.04 - 4026.00] okay crack open some oranges you can do
[4024.08 - 4028.88] that
[4026.00 - 4029.52] heavy metal detox movie is really a
[4028.88 - 4031.04] great
[4029.52 - 4032.72] way of doing it so what i would do is a
[4031.04 - 4034.64] 16 to 32 ounces of
[4032.72 - 4036.80] of lemon water first thing upon waking
[4034.64 - 4037.84] i'd wait 15 to 30 minutes hit the celery
[4036.80 - 4040.00] juice
[4037.84 - 4041.76] 16 to 30 000 celery's wait a little
[4040.00 - 4043.44] while and i would go into the heavy
[4041.76 - 4044.16] metal detox smoothie that's what i would
[4043.44 - 4047.12] do
[4044.16 - 4048.64] right and if you need to do a bowl of
[4047.12 - 4049.84] fruit like i said you can do a bowl of
[4048.64 - 4052.16] fruit that's fine
[4049.84 - 4054.88] if you need something heavier i'm making
[4052.16 - 4057.84] it right here it's a fat free option
[4054.88 - 4059.44] that i'm making right now i got it
[4057.84 - 4062.08] inside the waffle
[4059.44 - 4064.48] maker it's a potato waffle you can do
[4062.08 - 4067.36] millet as an option
[4064.48 - 4069.12] you can do um oatmeal as an option but
[4067.36 - 4072.08] keep the nut milks off
[4069.12 - 4074.16] keep the avocado away if you want to do
[4072.08 - 4075.36] a piece of gluten-free toast and that's
[4074.16 - 4077.44] what you want to do
[4075.36 - 4078.96] do a gluten-free piece of toast if
[4077.44 - 4082.72] that's what you want to do
[4078.96 - 4086.40] keep the avocado butter off of it
[4082.72 - 4088.24] in the morning keep away from eggs
[4086.40 - 4090.00] keep away from eggs too i'm going to see
[4088.24 - 4091.36] if this is done
[4090.00 - 4093.92] so i'm giving you all the different
[4091.36 - 4097.20] options you can do additional water you
[4093.92 - 4099.60] can do 16 ounces of water and you can do
[4097.20 - 4101.12] 16 ounces of coconut water some people
[4099.60 - 4104.32] aren't going to have the coconut water
[4101.12 - 4107.52] so you can do more water which is fine
[4104.32 - 4108.64] but drink another 16 ounces of coconut
[4107.52 - 4112.00] water if you can
[4108.64 - 4113.04] or minimum 16 ounces of water keep away
[4112.00 - 4114.72] the dried fruit
[4113.04 - 4116.32] it's okay if some is in there if that's
[4114.72 - 4117.92] what you want to do you're still ahead
[4116.32 - 4120.08] of the game because there's no fats
[4117.92 - 4123.44] going on but try to stay away from it
[4120.08 - 4126.48] and don't consume radical fats before
[4123.44 - 4129.60] noon if you keep up this practice you
[4126.48 - 4133.28] move ahead you move ahead
[4129.60 - 4136.56] you really do you move ahead
[4133.28 - 4139.68] and that's what we want i want you guys
[4136.56 - 4141.52] to heal i want you guys to move ahead i
[4139.68 - 4143.84] want you guys to get your life back
[4141.52 - 4145.20] i got two really hot waffles in my hands
[4143.84 - 4146.72] right here look at that these are the
[4145.20 - 4149.20] potato waffles
[4146.72 - 4151.36] and wow those are hot those are really
[4149.20 - 4154.08] hot let me get a plate
[4151.36 - 4155.84] patricia says wow i thought almond milk
[4154.08 - 4159.36] was healthy
[4155.84 - 4160.72] almond milk isn't how it it is a healthy
[4159.36 - 4165.28] option
[4160.72 - 4168.40] avocado is a healthy option
[4165.28 - 4170.24] nut butter is a healthy option
[4168.40 - 4172.32] i know this is hard for a lot of people
[4170.24 - 4175.36] it is okay
[4172.32 - 4177.04] walnuts are a healthy option almonds are
[4175.36 - 4179.12] a healthy option
[4177.04 - 4180.64] okay coconut water by the way i'm going
[4179.12 - 4182.48] to talk about that in a second don't do
[4180.64 - 4185.60] the pink coconut water right
[4182.48 - 4186.24] peanut butter is a healthy option if
[4185.60 - 4189.36] it's the
[4186.24 - 4189.84] really good stuff right not the not the
[4189.36 - 4195.20] junk
[4189.84 - 4198.40] right but those are healthy options
[4195.20 - 4201.52] but when you do them in the morning or
[4198.40 - 4203.28] late morning you won't cleanse and you
[4201.52 - 4205.60] won't go through that you won't go to
[4203.28 - 4208.32] the finish line to heal
[4205.60 - 4209.36] that's the problem have your avocado or
[4208.32 - 4212.40] your almond milk
[4209.36 - 4213.20] at the end of the day have it in you
[4212.40 - 4216.40] know have it
[4213.20 - 4217.76] in some oatmeal after maybe maybe
[4216.40 - 4220.72] afternoon
[4217.76 - 4222.80] okay have it in oatmeal for dinner have
[4220.72 - 4224.64] avocado toast for dinner
[4222.80 - 4225.92] have a salad if you're into fish and
[4224.64 - 4228.48] that's what you like to do
[4225.92 - 4229.60] and that's what you love to do then have
[4228.48 - 4232.64] your salmon
[4229.60 - 4235.92] at night for dinner
[4232.64 - 4238.08] have it dead but you don't have it
[4235.92 - 4239.36] during the morning try to go as far as
[4238.08 - 4241.28] you can i try to go
[4239.36 - 4243.36] like further like further without having
[4241.28 - 4244.72] the avocado i try to do it at night
[4243.36 - 4246.96] i'll try to do it at the end of the day
[4244.72 - 4250.40] if i'm going to have avocado
[4246.96 - 4253.60] okay so i know it's it's i get it
[4250.40 - 4257.04] the minute here's what happens
[4253.60 - 4258.48] here's what happens i say stay away from
[4257.04 - 4260.32] avocados stay away from nut
[4258.48 - 4261.60] milk stay with nut butter stay away from
[4260.32 - 4263.76] everything and then
[4261.60 - 4265.60] instantly and i i get this everybody
[4263.76 - 4267.76] feels this way not everybody but most
[4265.60 - 4270.56] everybody says wait a minute
[4267.76 - 4272.88] thought avocado was good for me he's he
[4270.56 - 4275.36] must be wrong because everybody's saying
[4272.88 - 4279.52] how avocado's so good he's must be out
[4275.36 - 4279.52] of touch he's not advanced at his info
[4280.08 - 4283.92] i got some waffles i'm going to put some
[4281.68 - 4288.16] syrup on there right now these waffles
[4283.92 - 4290.64] are insane gianna oat milk
[4288.16 - 4291.52] has a more concentrated amount of fat
[4290.64 - 4295.36] versus just
[4291.52 - 4298.96] eating oatmeal yes gianna it does
[4295.36 - 4300.48] spot on so i got these waffles right
[4298.96 - 4301.60] here now i'm going to put a little maple
[4300.48 - 4303.76] syrup on here this is
[4301.60 - 4305.52] say someone wants something heavier just
[4303.76 - 4307.28] like say oatmeal in the morning keep the
[4305.52 - 4308.16] radical fats off what you won't see here
[4307.28 - 4310.80] is butter
[4308.16 - 4312.08] you won't see avocado on these waffles
[4310.80 - 4313.28] you're not going to see that i'm
[4312.08 - 4316.24] dropping some
[4313.28 - 4317.12] some maple syrup on i'm putting a lot of
[4316.24 - 4319.60] it on
[4317.12 - 4321.84] because it's perfectly fine you're not
[4319.60 - 4325.12] going to get insulin resistance
[4321.84 - 4328.16] if you don't put on the milk cheese
[4325.12 - 4328.80] butter whatever it is the avocado you
[4328.16 - 4332.16] don't do that
[4328.80 - 4332.16] you got your waffles right there
[4332.40 - 4335.84] the key is to learn how to live your
[4334.48 - 4338.48] life
[4335.84 - 4340.08] and gaining energy from healing and not
[4338.48 - 4343.76] from caffeine
[4340.08 - 4346.80] not from caffeine abusing your adrenals
[4343.76 - 4351.12] that's a big key right there you don't
[4346.80 - 4351.12] want energy from caffeine
[4352.08 - 4356.24] abusing your adrenals you don't want to
[4354.32 - 4357.20] be doing the caffeine and living on that
[4356.24 - 4360.24] all your life
[4357.20 - 4362.64] and then the the caffeine causing your
[4360.24 - 4364.72] adrenals to go into fight or flight
[4362.64 - 4366.00] and then we just kill our adrenals over
[4364.72 - 4368.00] time as the years go on
[4366.00 - 4370.00] you want to get energy from having a
[4368.00 - 4372.16] clean liver you want it from having the
[4370.00 - 4375.36] medical medium warning cleanse
[4372.16 - 4377.04] you want your energy from having your
