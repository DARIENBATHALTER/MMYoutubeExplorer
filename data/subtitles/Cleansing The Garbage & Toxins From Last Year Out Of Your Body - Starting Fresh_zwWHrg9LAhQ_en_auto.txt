[517.32 - 521.52] about we shouldn't be eating something
[519.96 - 522.80] and now we need to punish ourselves it's
[521.52 - 525.88] not about that at all it's about the
[522.80 - 528.44] reality that so many people still eat
[525.88 - 530.40] things that are not healthy for them
[528.44 - 532.32] still eat things that are not productive
[530.40 - 534.56] for them they still eat things that
[532.32 - 537.00] actually can even hold them back or set
[534.56 - 539.80] them back it just happens every day it's
[537.00 - 542.40] a hard world out there and we have
[539.80 - 543.64] emotional attachments to food this is an
[542.40 - 545.60] ice cream right here that I'm going to
[543.64 - 548.72] have after the show I can't wait a
[545.60 - 550.76] Triple Decker chocolate espresso ice
[548.72 - 552.08] cream I'm excited about this it's so
[550.76 - 553.52] high in caffeine I'm going to be
[552.08 - 554.96] bouncing off the walls killing my
[553.52 - 557.04] adrenals and killing my liver but I
[554.96 - 558.60] don't care because I want to indulge and
[557.04 - 560.44] have a cheat day so I'm definitely going
[558.60 - 562.32] to have this right here you guys going
[560.44 - 564.84] into the new year a lot of people don't
[562.32 - 566.80] start doing good things for themselves
[564.84 - 569.84] on the day one of the new year it
[566.80 - 571.00] usually takes to be like January 15th
[569.84 - 573.08] everybody's like I'm going to do it on
[571.00 - 574.56] the 15th it's January 15th that's what
[573.08 - 575.92] I'm going to do it another person is
[574.56 - 578.08] like I'm going to do it by the end of
[575.92 - 579.56] January I'm going to start February 1st
[578.08 - 581.20] and there's this thing that happens
[579.56 - 583.80] where people are like know I'm going to
[581.20 - 585.56] do it in 3 days 7 Days 10 days next
[583.80 - 587.12] thing you know it it's like February 1st
[585.56 - 589.04] it's February 15th and then they're just
[587.12 - 592.36] like screw it I can't do it and a lot of
[589.04 - 596.16] people end up like that but we can start
[592.36 - 597.44] January 1st January 2nd we can do that a
[596.16 - 599.80] lot of people are just getting over
[597.44 - 601.64] their their hangovers and they don't
[599.80 - 603.40] want to start anything because they're
[601.64 - 605.52] still filled with alcohol and all kinds
[603.40 - 607.00] of other stuff and fun Foods in their
[605.52 - 609.60] blood streaming
[607.00 - 611.60] system so the whole thing with the
[609.60 - 614.48] morning cleanse is just so great because
[611.60 - 616.24] if you do it every single day you're
[614.48 - 618.24] protecting your liver even if you're
[616.24 - 621.12] somebody that's just eating whatever
[618.24 - 622.32] like if you're having chicken if you're
[621.12 - 624.36] somebody that eats animal protein and
[622.32 - 626.32] you have chicken every day if you do the
[624.36 - 628.48] morning cleanse and then you have
[626.32 - 630.76] chicken at the end of the day you're
[628.48 - 632.60] still doing incredible powerful things
[630.76 - 634.56] for your liver especially if the heavy
[632.60 - 637.44] metal detox smoothie is in your morning
[634.56 - 639.08] cleanse if that's in there you're really
[637.44 - 640.80] working on getting the metals out
[639.08 - 643.60] getting the junk out the garbage out
[640.80 - 645.76] it's really powerful so so many people
[643.60 - 648.00] they'll have like you know grassa beef
[645.76 - 649.88] or some kind of animal product have it
[648.00 - 652.64] at the end of the day do the morning
[649.88 - 655.32] plans in the morning keep the fats out
[652.64 - 658.36] in the morning the first half of the day
[655.32 - 661.04] that's the key right there so how does
[658.36 - 664.00] this work if you like salmon if you like
[661.04 - 667.16] fish if you like chicken if you like
[664.00 - 669.36] meat if you like avocados if you like
[667.16 - 674.20] nuts and seeds whatever it is that's an
[669.36 - 676.04] overt fat keep it out until after 12
[674.20 - 680.32] then I actually prefer if you keep it
[676.04 - 683.00] out even longer than that maybe till 3
[680.32 - 685.40] keep overt fats out till 3 if you're
[683.00 - 687.60] going to have the over fats you can even
[685.40 - 689.92] go later keep them out till 6 if you'd
[687.60 - 691.12] like but but I'm going to go into the
[689.92 - 692.92] morning cleanse a little bit and what
[691.12 - 694.44] that means to start with lemon water
[692.92 - 695.68] that's one thing right there so let me
[694.44 - 696.84] start getting some things out and then
[695.68 - 699.04] we'll talk about what this morning
[696.84 - 704.84] cleanse does for the liver what it does
[699.04 - 704.84] for the body and we go into that so I'm
[708.60 - 715.40] excited all right so I'm going to crack
[711.96 - 717.96] open a lemon right here you
[715.40 - 720.48] guys this is how easy it
[717.96 - 723.04] is the morning cleanse is so hard I
[720.48 - 724.96] can't do it it's just too hard I just
[723.04 - 729.64] did it just did a piece of it right
[724.96 - 733.28] there for you simple is that 16 to 32 oz
[729.64 - 736.28] of water squeeze a half a lemon right in
[733.28 - 738.28] it and you're
[736.28 - 740.56] good
[738.28 - 743.48] okay not hot
[740.56 - 746.80] water don't do hot water so it's really
[743.48 - 750.12] important to know all right cold water
[746.80 - 753.72] is fine luk warm water water is fine
[750.12 - 757.76] room temperature water is fine don't do
[753.72 - 760.96] hot water you just destroyed the lemon's
[757.76 - 763.12] ability to give you a liver flush in the
[760.96 - 765.68] morning to flush out the toxins and the
[763.12 - 768.00] poisons you took the lemon and you
[765.68 - 769.44] cooked it once you cook the lemon it
[768.00 - 772.12] does something different now you can
[769.44 - 773.64] cook lemon you can put it in food you
[772.12 - 776.04] can prepare food you can put it in
[773.64 - 779.60] dishes and stir fries and cook it down
[776.04 - 782.44] it's fine but when you put lemon
[779.60 - 784.80] in hot water you destroyed the
[782.44 - 786.48] mechanisms phytochemical compounds that
[784.80 - 788.80] work in a specific way with the Living
[786.48 - 790.52] Water built inside of that lemon and the
[788.80 - 791.72] calcium that comes deep within the clay
[790.52 - 794.36] of the earth that goes in the lemon
[791.72 - 797.44] roots and up into the lemon tree and out
[794.36 - 799.64] into that fruit you just annihilated all
[797.44 - 801.44] of it basically you have yeah still some
[799.64 - 804.72] nutrients and still some good stuff in
[801.44 - 807.32] there but you destroyed the living Fresh
[804.72 - 808.80] Fresh Living power that it has from the
[807.32 - 810.56] traes minerals and phytochemical comp
[808.80 - 812.68] compounds that have to stay floating in
[810.56 - 814.60] this suspension of living water inside
[812.68 - 818.80] of the lemon you destroyed it when you
[814.60 - 820.76] do hot water keep that in mind so and CU
[818.80 - 822.80] I see it every day I'm doing my my hot
[820.76 - 825.96] lemon water I'm doing my hot lemon water
[822.80 - 827.76] aw I'm like great that's good glad to
[825.96 - 829.72] hear that it's not doing what it needs
[827.76 - 832.00] to do it's doing something else it's
[829.72 - 833.80] good for you it's great for you it might
[832.00 - 836.72] help you go to the bathroom a little bit
[833.80 - 839.00] that does happen right so if you do that
[836.72 - 840.60] it might help you in a different way but
[839.00 - 842.28] it's not going to help you with what
[840.60 - 844.76] you're trying to do flush out the liver
[842.28 - 847.04] flush out the toxins and poisons so the
[844.76 - 849.72] first part of the morning cleanse is you
[847.04 - 851.72] take water 16 to 32 ounces right there
[849.72 - 853.12] you take a lemon cut it in half you
[851.72 - 855.64] squeeze it right there if you want to do
[853.12 - 858.24] the whole lemon do the whole lemon if
[855.64 - 861.04] you want to do half do half if you want
[858.24 - 862.88] more fine if you want less fine you can
[861.04 - 865.80] be somebody that doesn't like lemon then
[862.88 - 869.60] just do this check this out ready 3 4 5
[865.80 - 873.36] 6 7 8 nine 10 drops just do that
[869.60 - 875.72] just that I hate lemon aw I don't like
[873.36 - 880.92] it medical medium then just do this you
[875.72 - 884.56] ready one 2 3 4 5 6 7 that's it or 1 2 3
[880.92 - 888.72] 4 that's all you can do that I prefer
[884.56 - 891.04] you do a whole half like this boom done
[888.72 - 893.60] you want to do a whole one do a whole
[891.04 - 895.56] one okay your liver is working hard
[893.60 - 897.84] overnight it's Gathering up poisons and
[895.56 - 899.40] toxins it's working for you so that's
[897.84 - 901.20] what the liver does
[899.40 - 903.80] all night long while you're sleeping
[901.20 - 905.80] your liver's awake a lot of times people
[903.80 - 907.52] can't sleep good cuz the livers are
[905.80 - 909.88] spasming because they're working hard
[907.52 - 912.52] they're malfunctioning they're having
[909.88 - 915.20] difficult difficult abilities to work
[912.52 - 917.04] difficult difficult time functioning so
[915.20 - 919.48] what happens is as your liver is working
[917.04 - 921.20] all through the night cleaning out the
[919.48 - 923.48] toxins and cleaning out the poisons and
[921.20 - 926.04] getting them ready to be packaged up to
[923.48 - 928.68] go out the door to get to the kidneys
[926.04 - 930.88] and go out the door the lemon water
[928.68 - 933.08] comes in first thing in the morning and
[930.88 - 936.36] starts to grab onto the garbage and
[933.08 - 938.76] flushes it out that's the key but once
[936.36 - 943.84] again important information get a piece
[938.76 - 948.12] of paper out get a pen okay no hot water
[943.84 - 950.96] with the lemon it just doesn't work it
[948.12 - 953.76] won't give you that flush it won't help
[950.96 - 956.00] your skin it won't help your body detox
[953.76 - 958.80] it won't help your bloodstream clean up
[956.00 - 961.32] it won't help your lymphatic system so
[958.80 - 962.48] you go into a spa and you go in there
[961.32 - 964.88] you know what they give you now in the
[962.48 - 966.92] spa besides cucumbers on the eyes you
[964.88 - 971.04] know what they give you they give you a
[966.92 - 974.04] cup of hot lemon water why thank you oh
[971.04 - 976.44] fantastic I'm glad I'm spending $75,000
[974.04 - 979.00] in this Spa right now can you give me a
[976.44 - 980.56] hot glass of lemon water that sucks it's
[979.00 - 982.76] not going to even flush or cleanse me on
[980.56 - 984.32] any level that's how it works and that's
[982.76 - 986.80] what they do they give out hot lemon
[984.32 - 988.40] water you want it lukewarm room
[986.80 - 990.76] temperature I just have to say I have to
[988.40 - 992.92] say say a thousand times and guess what
[990.76 - 993.80] 5 years from now I'll be saying it again
[992.92 - 995.16] because there going to be a whole bunch
[993.80 - 997.52] of people that are putting it in hot
[995.16 - 999.32] water it's like crazy okay so that's the
[997.52 - 1002.04] first part of it right
[999.32 - 1003.96] there let's go into the second part what
[1002.04 - 1007.24] I like for the morning
[1003.96 - 1009.92] cleanse is celery
[1007.24 - 1012.16] juice celery
[1009.92 - 1014.40] juice do you guys remember in the celery
[1012.16 - 1016.80] juice book I put something back there
[1014.40 - 1018.76] somewhere deep into the celery and Juice
[1016.80 - 1021.20] book how they're going to try to take
[1018.76 - 1024.04] down celery juice knock it down out
[1021.20 - 1026.00] there say it's not really helpful say it
[1024.04 - 1028.20] doesn't do anything just eat a celery
[1026.00 - 1029.60] stick that's still going on out there
[1028.20 - 1031.76] there's also a bunch of rumors out there
[1029.60 - 1035.00] celer is bad for your skin celery's you
[1031.76 - 1036.80] know bad for this bad for that they're
[1035.00 - 1038.56] still doing it out there the truth is
[1036.80 - 1040.80] though they can't keep enough celery in
[1038.56 - 1043.88] the world in stores they can't keep
[1040.80 - 1047.44] enough in stock it is the biggest
[1043.88 - 1051.00] produce crop herb crop there is on the
[1047.44 - 1054.44] planet right now the largest there are
[1051.00 - 1057.28] thousands upon thousands upon thousands
[1054.44 - 1059.64] of celery Farms because of medical medum
[1057.28 - 1061.84] information everywhere on the planet
[1059.64 - 1064.44] growing celery there are trucks that
[1061.84 - 1066.16] deliver it just filled with celery not
[1064.44 - 1069.52] apples and celery not apples and
[1066.16 - 1071.84] cucumbers and C celery that's how insane
[1069.52 - 1074.48] it is it's in every health food store
[1071.84 - 1076.60] worldwide you can go into every hotel
[1074.48 - 1079.04] and order a celery juice right now
[1076.60 - 1081.16] that's how serious it is
[1079.04 - 1083.60] and so there's a reason for that because
[1081.16 - 1085.88] it really does help people heal whether
[1083.60 - 1088.24] they know it or not in in the sense
[1085.88 - 1090.16] where they you know whether they feel it
[1088.24 - 1092.08] or don't feel it it's changing their
[1090.16 - 1093.84] lives it's why they keep on drinking it
[1092.08 - 1095.92] because they know it's doing something
[1093.84 - 1097.72] one way or the other it might not do
[1095.92 - 1099.60] something within a minute but it might
[1097.72 - 1101.12] do something within a day it might not
[1099.60 - 1102.68] do something within a day for one person
[1101.12 - 1104.44] but then it does something in a month
[1102.68 - 1106.20] where it changes their life everybody's
[1104.44 - 1108.40] different I see acid reflux go away in
[1106.20 - 1110.52] one week for people I see skin problems
[1108.40 - 1111.88] go away in one month for people celery
[1110.52 - 1114.48] juice is one of these incredible
[1111.88 - 1116.64] Miracles that we have an herbal medicine
[1114.48 - 1118.32] Miracle that's at your fingertips it's
[1116.64 - 1121.12] the second thing I would recommend for
[1118.32 - 1125.00] the morning cleanse right here is celery
[1121.12 - 1127.28] juice I got mine I'm excited here it is
[1125.00 - 1130.48] so you got your lemon water you got your
[1127.28 - 1132.76] celery juice the next is you can go
[1130.48 - 1135.68] anywhere with this okay you can just do
[1132.76 - 1138.48] plain fruit you can cut up some apples
[1135.68 - 1140.28] you can do that you can do a lot of
[1138.48 - 1142.76] different things you can do apples you
[1140.28 - 1144.72] can do pears anything you want to do
[1142.76 - 1147.20] grapefruit I was doing some grapefruit
[1144.72 - 1150.48] juice I have it right here I'm going to
[1147.20 - 1153.80] have another sip right now if you don't
[1150.48 - 1153.80] mind so
[1154.52 - 1160.60] good you can do apples you can do a
[1157.76 - 1162.08] fruit plate you can have pears I'm
[1160.60 - 1164.80] cutting up a few right
[1162.08 - 1167.40] now all
[1164.80 - 1169.12] right you can just have plain fruit is
[1167.40 - 1170.92] what I'm trying to say
[1169.12 - 1173.36] just plain old
[1170.92 - 1175.84] fruit you can make a nice fruit dish you
[1173.36 - 1177.76] can put assortment of apples and berries
[1175.84 - 1180.96] together I got blackberries right here I
[1177.76 - 1183.88] got raspberries right there and
[1180.96 - 1187.84] blueberries so what I love about the
[1183.88 - 1191.64] morning cleanse is that you're not
[1187.84 - 1194.44] fasting fasting taxes the
[1191.64 - 1196.60] adrenals that's what taxes the adrenals
[1194.44 - 1199.36] I hear out there a bunch of
[1196.60 - 1201.88] different rumors that started by
[1199.36 - 1203.80] naysayers and haters and critics and
[1201.88 - 1206.52] they say oh cleansing too hard on
[1203.80 - 1209.16] medical medium cleansing too hard it's
[1206.52 - 1210.92] hard on my adrenals well that's funny
[1209.16 - 1212.36] because it's not hard on your adrenals
[1210.92 - 1215.20] it's impossible to be hard on your
[1212.36 - 1217.64] adrenals unless you stop eating if you
[1215.20 - 1220.56] stop eating for a complete day if you do
[1217.64 - 1222.76] a water fast for seven days if you do a
[1220.56 - 1226.00] water fast if you do intermittent
[1222.76 - 1229.96] fasting if you don't eat all day but you
[1226.00 - 1233.80] drink coffee that's hard on the adrenals
[1229.96 - 1234.84] that is what hurts adrenals right there
[1233.80 - 1236.92] another thing that's hard on the
[1234.84 - 1241.04] adrenals if you're eating too much over
[1236.92 - 1244.40] it fat over it fat takes adrenaline to
[1241.04 - 1246.20] actually help disperse okay so what
[1244.40 - 1249.24] happens is when we eat too much
[1246.20 - 1251.92] overfat the overfat doesn't get broken
[1249.24 - 1254.64] down too easy because the bile reserves
[1251.92 - 1257.36] are low in the liver it's not dispersing
[1254.64 - 1259.04] the fat well enough the fat ends up in
[1257.36 - 1261.24] the bloodstream
[1259.04 - 1262.88] too high in the bloodstream you end up
[1261.24 - 1265.84] getting insulin
[1262.88 - 1268.20] resistance the body then calls for
[1265.84 - 1270.44] adrenaline and your adrenals are now
[1268.20 - 1273.72] pumping out adrenaline the adrenaline is
[1270.44 - 1276.88] to thin out the blood it's kind of like
[1273.72 - 1279.04] gasoline turpentine it's a thinner a
[1276.88 - 1281.64] blood thinner so that's what adrenaline
[1279.04 - 1283.12] is for us it thins out the blood
[1281.64 - 1285.32] adrenaline is used for all kinds of
[1283.12 - 1287.44] things like if you're exercising what
[1285.32 - 1289.24] happens if your blood is too thick and
[1287.44 - 1290.92] you're exercising Ing and your heart
[1289.24 - 1292.16] starts to struggle cuz your blood is so
[1290.92 - 1293.44] thick cuz you're it's all filled your
[1292.16 - 1295.12] bloodstreams filled with fat while
[1293.44 - 1297.52] you're exercising while you're running
[1295.12 - 1298.96] or doing something what happens is that
[1297.52 - 1300.96] after your exercising your adrenals will
[1298.96 - 1302.48] release more and more adrenaline to get
[1300.96 - 1303.68] into your bloodstream to try to thin out
[1302.48 - 1305.04] the blood so you don't die of a heart
[1303.68 - 1308.20] attack while you're
[1305.04 - 1310.96] exercising so our adrenals are always
[1308.20 - 1315.20] that blood thinner for us keeping the
[1310.96 - 1316.68] fats dispersed keeping the blood thinner
[1315.20 - 1318.00] so we don't have a heart attack we don't
[1316.68 - 1319.60] have a stroke and that's what our
[1318.00 - 1322.40] adrenals do but what happens is when
[1319.60 - 1326.00] we're eating over fats in the morning
[1322.40 - 1327.96] now our adrenals are boom all on if you
[1326.00 - 1330.92] have chocolate if you have cream in your
[1327.96 - 1333.60] coffee if you have something like an
[1330.92 - 1335.88] avocado in the morning your adrenals are
[1333.60 - 1337.20] now releasing adrenaline to try to
[1335.88 - 1338.80] disperse it and thin it out I'm not
[1337.20 - 1340.68] saying avocado is bad that's not it
[1338.80 - 1343.28] something you can eat later on in the
[1340.68 - 1345.08] day but people are used to running on
[1343.28 - 1347.52] their own adrenaline they're addicted to
[1345.08 - 1348.56] their own adrenaline that's what people
[1347.52 - 1349.56] are
[1348.56 - 1353.36] they have
[1349.56 - 1355.72] adrenal addiction epinephrine adrenaline
[1353.36 - 1358.96] addiction that's what they have they run
[1355.72 - 1361.16] an adrenaline all day long and they like
[1358.96 - 1363.48] it it feels good gives them energy feels
[1361.16 - 1366.12] like they got energy they're on caffeine
[1363.48 - 1368.28] they're on chocolate they're on coffee
[1366.12 - 1370.64] they're on espressos they're on Macha
[1368.28 - 1373.16] tea they're on green tea and they got
[1370.64 - 1374.80] that caffeine pumping and so their
[1373.16 - 1376.72] adrenals are just constantly pumping so
[1374.80 - 1378.80] they're on adrenaline then they hop on a
[1376.72 - 1380.32] treadmill or their EX exercising they're
[1378.80 - 1382.92] exercising trying to use up all that
[1380.32 - 1384.00] adrenaline right and then they go and
[1382.92 - 1385.40] they eat something where I'm going to
[1384.00 - 1386.52] eat a whole bunch of high protein or a
[1385.40 - 1388.04] whole bunch of protein they end up
[1386.52 - 1390.92] eating a whole bunch of fat with that
[1388.04 - 1393.52] protein because it's mixed in it's
[1390.92 - 1396.08] naturally there and when they do that
[1393.52 - 1397.52] their adrenals are now doing it again
[1396.08 - 1399.60] they're just releasing adrenaline
[1397.52 - 1403.52] adrenaline so we live on adrenaline
[1399.60 - 1405.16] we're Adrenaline Junkies most of us walk
[1403.52 - 1406.88] around like that the morning cleanse
[1405.16 - 1410.56] protects your
[1406.88 - 1413.68] adrenals adrenal glands medical medium
[1410.56 - 1416.88] cleanses bring your adrenals back so
[1413.68 - 1418.80] much so so much so that when you go off
[1416.88 - 1421.72] of a medical medium
[1418.80 - 1422.60] 369 you go off of a medical medium 28
[1421.72 - 1425.64] day
[1422.60 - 1428.64] cleanse you go off of a medical medium
[1425.64 - 1433.16] mono eeding cleanse your adrenals got so
[1428.64 - 1434.92] strong and so preserved and so reserved

[1446.92 - 1451.44] releasing adrenaline and you're feeling
[1449.24 - 1455.04] better because you did all the work you
[1451.44 - 1456.36] re you basically refurbish them all
[1455.04 - 1458.36] throughout the time you're doing the
[1456.36 - 1460.08] medical medium cleanses you restored
[1458.36 - 1462.48] them all throughout the time you're
[1460.08 - 1464.40] doing medical medium cleanses and so
[1462.48 - 1466.40] what people don't realize is that
[1464.40 - 1469.80] medical me cleanses bring back the
[1466.40 - 1469.80] adrenals now
[1471.80 - 1476.20] intermittent fasting is not a medical
[1473.36 - 1478.56] medium cleanse it destroys the
[1476.20 - 1481.36] adrenals water
[1478.56 - 1482.44] fasting long term for reasons that are
[1481.36 - 1486.12] not
[1482.44 - 1488.72] emergency is not a medical medium
[1486.12 - 1490.28] thing it's not and that destroys the
[1488.72 - 1492.52] adrenal
[1490.28 - 1493.96] glands so there are lots of different
[1492.52 - 1497.08] things that hurt
[1493.96 - 1499.48] adrenals and medical medum information
[1497.08 - 1503.00] doesn't do that it's not about
[1499.48 - 1506.00] that it's about preserving the adrenals
[1503.00 - 1507.56] keeping them strong keeping them healthy
[1506.00 - 1510.52] I got some Millet in the pot right here
[1507.56 - 1512.56] I think it's done turning this off right
[1510.52 - 1515.84] here for a
[1512.56 - 1520.56] moment you look for this right here I
[1515.84 - 1520.56] take a look you guys oh yeah that's
[1520.88 - 1528.16] nice that is definitely good let's make
[1524.00 - 1530.48] some banana oat breakfast cookies let's
[1528.16 - 1530.48] do
[1530.84 - 1534.04] that all right let's move some of this
[1532.80 - 1535.68] we're going to talk about adrenals a
[1534.04 - 1538.12] little bit more and the liver a little
[1535.68 - 1538.12] bit more
[1538.40 - 1543.72] too I want to make sure that whatever
[1541.12 - 1547.12] you're taking into the new year poisons
[1543.72 - 1549.68] toxins junk garbage that's inside of
[1547.12 - 1553.40] your body I want to make sure you get
[1549.68 - 1557.44] rid of it this is the year coming up
[1553.40 - 1562.56] where you cleanse to heal this is the
[1557.44 - 1565.48] year here you cleanse to actually heal
[1562.56 - 1568.48] and get over the finish line and the
[1565.48 - 1571.32] morning cleanse is a protective measure
[1568.48 - 1572.96] so that if you mess up and you're this
[1571.32 - 1574.28] like I'm at a fast food restaurant
[1572.96 - 1575.44] there's nothing I could do I just gobble
[1574.28 - 1578.32] down a double cheeseburger that your
[1575.44 - 1581.56] morning cleanse is helping to protect
[1578.32 - 1584.12] you that it's actually helping to
[1581.56 - 1588.24] protect you through the process of a
[1584.12 - 1590.76] hard year or a hard day or a hard month
[1588.24 - 1593.16] or whatever it is a hard emotional
[1590.76 - 1594.64] moment that we end up doing something
[1593.16 - 1597.88] where eat a chocolate bar will you know
[1594.64 - 1599.32] my morning cleanses help to protect me
[1597.88 - 1601.84] whatever it
[1599.32 - 1604.96] is you start your day with something you
[1601.84 - 1608.84] can accomplish something you can get
[1604.96 - 1611.28] done if it's simple as just lemon water
[1608.84 - 1613.40] boom get your juicer out make yourself
[1611.28 - 1615.84] some celery juice
[1613.40 - 1619.32] boom maybe do the heavy metal detox
[1615.84 - 1621.88] movie and drive Metals out of your brain
[1619.32 - 1625.04] and your liver and your body boom we'll
[1621.88 - 1627.56] do that this year why
[1625.04 - 1629.12] not and if it means starting January 1st
[1627.56 - 1630.88] we start January 1st if it means
[1629.12 - 1633.12] starting another time we do it but we
[1630.88 - 1635.00] will do it because this is about
[1633.12 - 1636.36] cleansing to heal this time and that's
[1635.00 - 1637.84] where we're going I want to start making
[1636.36 - 1641.44] a couple of things you guys I got a lot
[1637.84 - 1643.32] to do all right and some roll Nots right

[1643.32 - 1650.04] look okay and I am going to before I do
[1647.76 - 1651.24] anything with those roll rops I'm going
[1650.04 - 1655.36] to take a bowl right here I'm going to
[1651.24 - 1657.44] mash up four bananas let's go four
[1655.36 - 1659.88] bananas is what I
[1657.44 - 1661.64] want start your day with something you
[1659.88 - 1663.56] can accomplish in the morning every
[1661.64 - 1665.64] single day some lemon water some celery
[1663.56 - 1667.80] juice but I'm going to give you a lot of
[1665.64 - 1670.48] different options okay I'm just
[1667.80 - 1672.60] making what you see right here is some
[1670.48 - 1675.12] oatmeal cookies banana oatmeal cookies
[1672.60 - 1676.80] because guess what you can do it and
[1675.12 - 1678.68] still be on the morning cleanse if you
[1676.80 - 1680.80] want to eat this at some point in the
[1678.68 - 1684.68] morning you can still do it and be on
[1680.80 - 1687.92] the morning cleanse how insane is
[1684.68 - 1687.92] that it's
[1688.00 - 1692.92] incredible so we're going to make also a
[1690.88 - 1696.44] millet porridge that's something you do
[1692.92 - 1697.68] and we're going to make hardboiled eggs
[1696.44 - 1698.96] so you guys want to stick around for the
[1697.68 - 1702.60] hardboiled
[1698.96 - 1705.36] eggs I'm making hardboiled
[1702.60 - 1708.20] eggs all right I feel so bad for eating
[1705.36 - 1711.16] chocolate for the past 10 days it's okay
[1708.20 - 1715.04] we can do the morning cleanse we can do
[1711.16 - 1718.16] the morning cleanse is what we can
[1715.04 - 1721.88] do don't feel bad we'll do the morning
[1718.16 - 1723.44] cleanse I'm excited it's all right
[1721.88 - 1726.28] there's a reason why you're eating
[1723.44 - 1727.16] chocolate for the last 10 days there is
[1726.28 - 1730.76] a
[1727.16 - 1733.60] reason it could be anything emotional
[1730.76 - 1736.88] emotional reason you're having a tough
[1733.60 - 1738.84] time maybe a difficult time maybe you're
[1736.88 - 1741.88] under stress maybe you're going through
[1738.84 - 1743.84] a lot maybe you're just addicted and
[1741.88 - 1745.80] you're having that chocolate because you
[1743.84 - 1747.48] feel like you need it that the addiction
[1745.80 - 1749.32] maybe you're running on adrenaline
[1747.48 - 1751.16] because of that chocolate it's it's
[1749.32 - 1753.08] cranking your adrenaline it's keeping
[1751.16 - 1754.64] you functioning for the moment maybe
[1753.08 - 1756.76] it's helping your brain where you're
[1754.64 - 1758.48] thinking a little better and clearer but
[1756.76 - 1760.08] it's it's kind of a vicious cycle
[1758.48 - 1761.36] because you're thinking a little clearer
[1760.08 - 1763.48] and then all of a sudden you got to come
[1761.36 - 1766.32] down from it it's like a roller coaster
[1763.48 - 1768.92] ride the chocolate brings you
[1766.32 - 1771.96] up tread every on the roller coaster is
[1768.92 - 1773.88] going up you're going up and then
[1771.96 - 1776.92] everybody goes
[1773.88 - 1781.12] down get the chocolate back in there
[1776.92 - 1781.12] chocolate bar okay okay that's enough
[1786.00 - 1789.96] chocolate it's going screaming screaming
[1788.48 - 1791.88] it's more
[1789.96 - 1793.32] chocolate and it's over and over again
[1791.88 - 1795.64] it's like a vicious
[1793.32 - 1799.32] cycle that's what it
[1795.64 - 1799.32] is all right
[1799.96 - 1802.96] I'm just mashing up these bananas right
[1801.72 - 1804.28] here I'm also going to put a couple of
[1802.96 - 1807.24] other things in here
[1804.28 - 1811.12] too put some cinnamon in here and I'm
[1807.24 - 1811.12] going to put some raisins in here all
[1811.36 - 1819.76] right don't feel bad that you're eating
[1815.60 - 1821.64] chocolate instead what we're going to do
[1819.76 - 1824.04] is we're going to change some things
[1821.64 - 1825.84] we're going to bring in something like
[1824.04 - 1827.64] the morning cleanse and then it's going
[1825.84 - 1828.92] to help us and it's going to empow and
[1827.64 - 1831.68] then we're going to be able to let go of
[1828.92 - 1834.28] the RS of the chocolate demon because
[1831.68 - 1837.32] the chocolate demon is brutal it's a
[1834.28 - 1839.76] brutal demon a chocolate demon it's got
[1837.32 - 1842.76] the world trapped putting cinnamon in
[1839.76 - 1845.20] here if you don't mind excited about
[1842.76 - 1846.80] that a little touch of that in there I'm

[2030.32 - 2034.44] cookies I got my little pan
[2035.96 - 2042.60] here I'm going to put it right here you

[2042.60 - 2048.12] in cleans here right here now listen
[2046.20 - 2051.68] we're doing the morning cleanse you can
[2048.12 - 2056.00] actually still cleanse while eating
[2051.68 - 2058.12] gluten-free banana o cookies right there
[2056.00 - 2063.32] there we go you guys see them you can
[2058.12 - 2063.32] actually still cleanse while eating
[2064.00 - 2070.84] this I mean and that is
[2068.28 - 2073.68] powerful powerful to know all right
[2070.84 - 2073.68] let's start getting these
[2074.16 - 2079.92] going guys I got a lot of moving Parts
[2076.60 - 2082.40] going on today let's just hope I don't
[2079.92 - 2084.84] mess something up how big do you like
[2082.40 - 2087.76] your cookies you like them small I like
[2084.84 - 2091.76] them a little bigger popping that one in
[2087.76 - 2094.20] there I don't really like tiny
[2091.76 - 2095.64] cookies I know that like sometimes
[2094.20 - 2097.16] people make them really small I like
[2095.64 - 2100.04] making them bigger but you know what
[2097.16 - 2102.48] that's a little too big right
[2100.04 - 2104.28] there I'm going to make
[2102.48 - 2106.72] these
[2104.28 - 2109.32] nice you make a smaller cookie you can
[2106.72 - 2112.24] eat more of them right people do that
[2109.32 - 2116.84] they're like they feel like they are
[2112.24 - 2119.04] less guilty if they eat a bunch of small
[2116.84 - 2121.88] ones but you don't have to be guilty
[2119.04 - 2124.08] about these I'm
[2121.88 - 2127.64] excited all right make some different
[2124.08 - 2131.40] sizes here so what happens is if you
[2127.64 - 2134.48] keep the overt fats out of your diet out
[2131.40 - 2137.68] of your way in the morning your liver
[2134.48 - 2139.68] can actually clean this means that if
[2137.68 - 2143.36] you've eaten fat in the morning most of
[2139.68 - 2146.84] your life your liver never got a chance
[2143.36 - 2149.48] to ever cleanse cleanse as far as things
[2146.84 - 2151.44] that are deep deep inside your liver
[2149.48 - 2153.60] never got a chance to cleanse out
[2151.44 - 2157.56] poisons and toxins that were deep in
[2153.60 - 2159.08] there maybe a few surface toxins escaped
[2157.56 - 2163.00] a few surface
[2159.08 - 2165.80] toxins but not the Deep stuff definitely
[2163.00 - 2169.16] certainly not the metals for sure no
[2165.80 - 2171.24] metals are coming out toxic heavy metals
[2169.16 - 2174.04] sit inside the liver inside the organs
[2171.24 - 2177.08] in the brain for a lifetime until you
[2174.04 - 2180.08] wake up one morning you're like who Am I
[2177.08 - 2181.40] who am I until you wake up in the
[2180.08 - 2183.12] morning and you're walking down the
[2181.40 - 2184.80] street in your
[2183.12 - 2188.48] underpants and you're actually
[2184.80 - 2193.08] jaywalking in your underpants
[2188.48 - 2194.48] and there's a alert out on you because
[2193.08 - 2196.88] you're
[2194.48 - 2199.20] missing that's what
[2196.88 - 2201.60] happens when the metals build up and the
[2199.20 - 2204.72] metals build up and they build
[2201.60 - 2207.84] up they build up until you're at your
[2204.72 - 2212.32] psychiatrist's office on four
[2207.84 - 2215.08] anti-depressants and then on four anti-
[2212.32 - 2219.04] anxieties the metals build up and build
[2215.08 - 2222.04] up until your OC CD is so bad that you
[2219.04 - 2223.56] are just totally freaked out with
[2222.04 - 2225.28] everything that's happening in your life
[2223.56 - 2226.56] and you're suffering and this is not a
[2225.28 - 2230.44] joke you're
[2226.56 - 2234.04] suffering the metals can build up so
[2230.44 - 2236.32] bad where you know your eczema and your
[2234.04 - 2239.48] psoriasis and your skin problems are
[2236.32 - 2242.44] really really out of
[2239.48 - 2244.96] control metals can build up so bad that
[2242.44 - 2248.96] your autoimmune and your chronic
[2244.96 - 2250.80] fatigue can get just so bad because
[2248.96 - 2253.80] viruses like the upsteam bar are feeding
[2250.80 - 2257.72] off your metals and you're really
[2253.80 - 2260.56] struggling and then people don't realize
[2257.72 - 2263.00] they can get so bad that you can get to
[2260.56 - 2265.60] the point where you don't you have like

[2783.00 - 2786.44] binders medical medium doesn't know
[2785.24 - 2788.96] about binders
[2786.44 - 2791.92] ERS he's he's he doesn't get it he
[2788.96 - 2795.64] doesn't know you should listen to me
[2791.92 - 2797.84] I'll give you the binder talk really the
[2795.64 - 2802.32] wild blueberry is the ultimate
[2797.84 - 2805.08] binder the ultimate ultimate
[2802.32 - 2807.16] binder okay I'm just going to be
[2805.08 - 2809.00] straight out here the reason why you
[2807.16 - 2811.92] don't hear me talk about
[2809.00 - 2815.88] binders because the ultimate binder is
[2811.92 - 2818.20] actually in the drink that's why I I
[2815.88 - 2819.76] don't need to talk about binders but you
[2818.20 - 2821.20] guys need to talk about binders out
[2819.76 - 2824.12] there that are like naysayers are like
[2821.20 - 2824.12] he doesn't know about
[2824.64 - 2830.80] binders all
[2826.64 - 2833.60] right anyway there it is right there the
[2830.80 - 2836.12] pectin from the wild blueberry by far
[2833.60 - 2837.68] one of the greatest ultimate binders the
[2836.12 - 2839.20] wild blueberry and the anthocyans are
[2837.68 - 2842.56] the ultimate
[2839.20 - 2845.80] binder and so have you noticed something
[2842.56 - 2847.20] have you guys noticed something the wild
[2845.80 - 2848.68] blueberry what it does have you noticed
[2847.20 - 2850.68] something about what happens here it
[2848.68 - 2852.92] gels up have you noticed that it starts
[2850.68 - 2854.16] to gel take a look right here give it a
[2852.92 - 2856.60] little time how many of you guys made
[2854.16 - 2858.88] the heavy metal detox smoothie and it
[2856.60 - 2861.24] gelled up to the point where it was like
[2858.88 - 2863.64] jello where you're doing this like clunk
[2861.24 - 2866.80] clunk clun clunk clunk and it was like
[2863.64 - 2869.40] jell give it a couple of minutes it's
[2866.80 - 2872.36] congealing right now as we
[2869.40 - 2874.44] speak why is it
[2872.36 - 2877.72] congealing that's the
[2874.44 - 2881.20] binder that is is the wild the
[2877.72 - 2883.92] blueberry that is the ultimate binder
[2881.20 - 2885.84] right there that's what it's for nobody
[2883.92 - 2887.48] knew that the wild blueberry had
[2885.84 - 2890.16] anything to do with removing toxic heavy
[2887.48 - 2894.28] metals that's mm info right nobody knew
[2890.16 - 2896.48] that ever okay because a berry won't do
[2894.28 - 2898.68] it a just a plain old Berry won't do it
[2896.48 - 2900.36] a cultivated blueberry won't do it
[2898.68 - 2902.24] people don't know people didn't know it
[2900.36 - 2904.36] did it they had no idea what could even
[2902.24 - 2906.64] take out of metal and now worldwide
[2904.36 - 2909.88] right now people are talking about oh
[2906.64 - 2913.16] the wild blueberry and the other things
[2909.88 - 2916.20] that are in here and and the key is
[2913.16 - 2917.68] you'll see like it's starting to now gel
[2916.20 - 2920.44] right there it is it's starting to turn
[2917.68 - 2923.40] into Jello-O so it's now getting thicker
[2920.44 - 2924.88] and thicker right it's congealing right
[2923.40 - 2927.48] there in front of us that's what it's
[2924.88 - 2928.84] doing so it's getting less liquidy by
[2927.48 - 2930.64] the minute how many of you guys have
[2928.84 - 2933.32] left your heavy metal detox smoothie
[2930.64 - 2934.72] somewhere like on the counter or
[2933.32 - 2937.84] something in somewhere in the kitchen or
[2934.72 - 2942.00] maybe in your office or in your car and
[2937.84 - 2945.64] it basically turned into almost like
[2942.00 - 2948.56] jello where if you dump the glass over
[2945.64 - 2951.60] it would it would come out almost in one
[2948.56 - 2953.56] piece how many people have done that
[2951.60 - 2956.48] that's the
[2953.56 - 2959.60] binder it's why I've never talked about
[2956.48 - 2963.76] a binder because it is a
[2959.60 - 2966.08] binder that is one of the things that we
[2963.76 - 2968.72] need to understand
[2966.08 - 2970.32] but it's amazing any anywhere someone
[2968.72 - 2971.88] can get away with anything they can
[2970.32 - 2974.04] they'll be like okay let's throw that at
[2971.88 - 2975.76] him let's try to chop him down a little
[2974.04 - 2977.32] bit let's try to chip away at him a
[2975.76 - 2979.44] little bit more let's say he doesn't
[2977.32 - 2980.92] know anything about binders let's start
[2979.44 - 2982.20] talking about all the bonite clay and
[2980.92 - 2983.88] all the other stuff and all the other
[2982.20 - 2987.04] garbage that we're putting in the smooth
[2983.88 - 2990.92] let's talk about that dude you missed it
[2987.04 - 2993.36] you missed the boat it is a binder sorry
[2990.92 - 2996.08] anyway and there it is heavy metal detox
[2993.36 - 2998.24] smoothie it is the ultimate nature B
[2996.08 - 3002.00] says oh my God I think I have the wrong
[2998.24 - 3004.68] blueberries European ones they don't gel
[3002.00 - 3006.40] it's because they could be calling them
[3004.68 - 3008.28] the wild blueberry but they're not a
[3006.40 - 3009.92] wild blueberry I noticed in Europe they
[3008.28 - 3011.72] do that so there's a there's there's
[3009.92 - 3013.52] they use like bilberries and stuff like
[3011.72 - 3015.92] that and they call them a wild blueberry
[3013.52 - 3017.36] but they're not a wild blueberry and
[3015.92 - 3019.16] people just don't know this so all
[3017.36 - 3020.72] through Europe right now that's what's
[3019.16 - 3022.76] happening they're not using the wild
[3020.72 - 3024.40] blueberry they're not they're using a
[3022.76 - 3025.68] different Berry and that different Berry
[3024.40 - 3027.12] might have a different makeup of
[3025.68 - 3029.16] antioxidants it might even be higher
[3027.12 - 3031.64] than an antioxidant but that's not the
[3029.16 - 3034.32] key that's not how it works for removing
[3031.64 - 3035.92] Metals it takes the wild bluebery to
[3034.32 - 3037.52] remove metals because there's a
[3035.92 - 3039.24] difference because of its binding
[3037.52 - 3042.40] properties are unlike anything else and
[3039.24 - 3046.00] unmatched and you can't measure that
[3042.40 - 3047.96] good luck go ahead and try The Binding
[3046.00 - 3050.08] properties in the wild blueberry
[3047.96 - 3051.56] supersede anything in the European what
[3050.08 - 3054.44] they call a wild blueberry that's a
[3051.56 - 3056.12] billberry or whatever supersedes
[3054.44 - 3059.20] it
[3056.12 - 3060.92] and that's how it works it's not about
[3059.20 - 3062.76] how much antioxidant you have that
[3060.92 - 3065.80] doesn't determine how like if the metals
[3062.76 - 3068.68] leave or not that's only and there's
[3065.80 - 3070.32] different antioxidants you can't just BL
[3068.68 - 3072.72] do a blatant thing where you're saying
[3070.32 - 3074.84] antioxidant and there all every antiox
[3072.72 - 3076.64] there's antioxidants in coffee does that
[3074.84 - 3078.76] take out Metals no instead it kills your
[3076.64 - 3081.40] brain there's like you you have to
[3078.76 - 3084.36] understand you can have an antioxidant
[3081.40 - 3087.24] in something there's antioxidant in
[3084.36 - 3088.88] psilocybin
[3087.24 - 3091.48] but it doesn't mean it's good for you on
[3088.88 - 3092.88] any level there's antioxidants in every
[3091.48 - 3094.68] Berry but it doesn't mean it's going to
[3092.88 - 3097.32] be the one to remove the
[3094.68 - 3100.92] metals so what I noticed in Europe and
[3097.32 - 3102.88] it's just no no disrespect on any level
[3100.92 - 3104.48] but I'm noticing they're packaging up
[3102.88 - 3106.08] different berries out there and they're
[3104.48 - 3108.16] telling people that this is going to do
[3106.08 - 3110.64] it this is going to remove your Metals
[3108.16 - 3112.12] this is what you use in the hdms this
[3110.64 - 3113.76] here's what it is and what they don't
[3112.12 - 3116.12] realize is it may have a different
[3113.76 - 3117.68] composition of antioxidant it may maybe
[3116.12 - 3119.36] maybe even a higher composition of
[3117.68 - 3121.36] antioxidant doesn't mean that's the
[3119.36 - 3122.68] antioxidant that helps in guiding Metals
[3121.36 - 3124.44] out and it doesn't mean that's the one
[3122.68 - 3126.36] that has the high enough gelatinous
[3124.44 - 3127.52] binder that doesn't mean any of that and
[3126.36 - 3129.20] that's the difference and that's the
[3127.52 - 3131.16] difference with s so and why things work
[3129.20 - 3133.24] and what they don't they also haven't
[3131.16 - 3136.08] discovered all the antioxidants that
[3133.24 - 3137.84] they're able to even measure in the wild
[3136.08 - 3139.64] BL to be to begin with they haven't even
[3137.84 - 3141.04] measured them and looked at all of them
[3139.64 - 3142.96] and that's a whole another thing on its
[3141.04 - 3145.32] own it's what works it's not about
[3142.96 - 3147.64] waiting for science every second it's
[3145.32 - 3149.56] about what works and what the track
[3147.64 - 3150.84] record is the track record of people
[3149.56 - 3152.04] getting out of wheelchairs the track
[3150.84 - 3154.36] record of people getting rid of
[3152.04 - 3156.96] depression that's the track record I'm
[3154.36 - 3158.40] talking about not some article somewhere
[3156.96 - 3161.28] that's going to chop up a bunch of
[3158.40 - 3163.72] studies that never really happened it's
[3161.28 - 3165.04] about what is going to work because when
[3163.72 - 3166.44] you're Downing out and you're on your
[3165.04 - 3168.40] hands and knees and you're praying to
[3166.44 - 3171.40] God and you're like I'm going to die if
[3168.40 - 3173.84] I don't get better I am literally think
[3171.40 - 3175.68] I think I'm going to die my I have 50
[3173.84 - 3177.00] neurological symptoms no no one
[3175.68 - 3178.76] understands me no one gets what I've
[3177.00 - 3180.48] gone through and what I'm going through
[3178.76 - 3182.68] and I think I'm dying and I have no hope
[3180.48 - 3184.92] left it's about what works that's when
[3182.68 - 3186.52] it counts boom it's about what works and
[3184.92 - 3187.72] that's where it is and I'm noticing out
[3186.52 - 3189.56] there I get it there's a lot of people
[3187.72 - 3192.36] that are like just like no you can put
[3189.56 - 3194.76] this Berry inside of a canister you can
[3192.36 - 3196.36] put this Berry inside of a glass jar and
[3194.76 - 3199.08] look or whatever you want to do and
[3196.36 - 3201.08] Market it the way you want doesn't mean
[3199.08 - 3202.84] that's a wild blueberry they may call it
[3201.08 - 3204.84] a wild blueberry you can call anything
[3202.84 - 3206.32] yeah okay sure here's a wild blueberry
[3204.84 - 3207.44] everybody here it is this is a wild
[3206.32 - 3209.96] blueberry I'm going to put it in a
[3207.44 - 3212.00] package now that's a Blackberry but no
[3209.96 - 3214.00] I'll call it a wild blueberry that's
[3212.00 - 3216.20] what people can do and it's crazy point
[3214.00 - 3218.24] is is the wild blueberry what you see
[3216.20 - 3219.60] right here that's the one and it's
[3218.24 - 3221.56] getting actually starting to really
[3219.60 - 3224.72] congeal right now and get actually to a
[3221.56 - 3226.64] point all right you guys I'm just saying
[3224.72 - 3228.00] this because there's a lot of people
[3226.64 - 3229.92] that they don't
[3228.00 - 3232.00] know they may not know why they're
[3229.92 - 3234.52] healing as fast as they want to heal and
[3232.00 - 3236.40] that's that's part of it too so it all
[3234.52 - 3238.08] matters every little bit matters The
[3236.40 - 3239.96] Details Matter so we just made the heavy
[3238.08 - 3242.24] metal detox smoothie boom we got that
[3239.96 - 3244.08] done let's make a porridge right now
[3242.24 - 3248.68] okay let's we can get on to
[3244.08 - 3251.04] that all right
[3248.68 - 3252.24] so if you want something harder if

[3439.64 - 3446.80] few sprinkle them right on top like

[3472.00 - 3475.16] things right but you don't want to put
[3473.88 - 3476.88] that in things in the morning this is
[3475.16 - 3479.56] the morning Cleanse This is a hearty
[3476.88 - 3482.48] option for a morning cleanse breakfast
[3479.56 - 3485.72] right there there it is
[3482.48 - 3488.36] millet with wild blueberries and a
[3485.72 - 3489.68] little bit of maple syrup incredible
[3488.36 - 3490.88] we're going to I can't wait to try a
[3489.68 - 3492.56] little later let's check out those
[3490.88 - 3495.80] cookies they're
[3492.56 - 3498.84] cooking cookies are just about done I'd
[3495.80 - 3501.88] say a few more minutes okay now we're
[3498.84 - 3505.64] going to make a hardboiled
[3501.88 - 3507.00] egg that's next now what I like about
[3505.64 - 3510.04] these hardboiled
[3507.00 - 3511.56] eggs is they're not like the other
[3510.04 - 3514.32] hard-boiled eggs that we're talking
[3511.56 - 3517.96] about these are much
[3514.32 - 3520.12] different and much more fun to make I
[3517.96 - 3521.84] think I think they're more fun to make
[3520.12 - 3523.72] so you can have somebody that like
[3521.84 - 3526.80] really wants that hearty flavor that
[3523.72 - 3529.20] hearty taste something hearty inside of
[3526.80 - 3530.56] them I recommend this so so let's start
[3529.20 - 3533.60] making these hard-boiled eggs so what
[3530.56 - 3535.84] you see is a rusted potato right there
[3533.60 - 3537.28] now it takes a little creativity
[3535.84 - 3538.88] so in the sense where you're going to
[3537.28 - 3540.72] make these I'm going to cut a piece
[3538.88 - 3544.32] right off that potato just like that
[3540.72 - 3547.32] take a look you guys okay all
[3544.32 - 3550.24] right and I'm going to peel this potato
[3547.32 - 3553.96] in the shape of an egg this is so simple
[3550.24 - 3556.16] and so easy it's ridiculous okay see
[3553.96 - 3558.92] peeling this and I'm even going slow
[3556.16 - 3561.92] instead of fast so I do like to do
[3558.92 - 3564.96] things quicker but I'm taking my time on
[3561.92 - 3567.08] this one there we go I'm going to make a
[3564.96 - 3570.08] few of these right here there's one
[3567.08 - 3572.80] hardboiled egg look at that I'm going to
[3570.08 - 3572.80] grab a little
[3574.48 - 3580.24] bowl what I'm going to
[3577.48 - 3580.96] do okay is I'm going to use that bowl in
[3580.24 - 3585.16] a
[3580.96 - 3586.88] minute it's one hardboiled egg right
[3585.16 - 3588.68] there I'm going to make another
[3586.88 - 3590.92] hardboiled egg out of the same potato
[3588.68 - 3594.72] check this out okay now you can save
[3590.92 - 3596.12] those little potato pieces you're ready
[3594.72 - 3599.36] we're going to make another one it's
[3596.12 - 3603.44] going to come out really nice I can tell
[3599.36 - 3606.04] already right so there we go okay I'm
[3603.44 - 3607.84] going to shape this one all good going
[3606.04 - 3611.12] to get this one done another hardboiled
[3607.84 - 3614.00] egg two hardboiled eggs sitting right
[3611.12 - 3615.44] there now I got the rest of this potato
[3614.00 - 3617.52] I might be able to get a couple more out
[3615.44 - 3619.84] of that one I'll I'll switch I'll try
[3617.52 - 3622.32] another potato as well here we go I'm
[3619.84 - 3625.60] going to cut this piece off make another
[3622.32 - 3628.68] hardboiled egg right out of here
[3625.60 - 3632.12] there we go I'm going to make a few of
[3628.68 - 3634.00] them these can go anywhere on salads if
[3632.12 - 3634.68] you want you want that hardboiled egg on
[3634.00 - 3638.04] a
[3634.68 - 3639.24] salad these can go on anything but
[3638.04 - 3642.12] you're thinking like why is this a
[3639.24 - 3643.48] hardboiled egg you can make it taste
[3642.12 - 3645.84] real good cuz we're going to do
[3643.48 - 3648.88] something with this we're not done this
[3645.84 - 3651.40] one's got a little spot in the center
[3648.88 - 3653.52] there we go I got three hardboiled eggs
[3651.40 - 3656.96] let me make a
[3653.52 - 3660.80] fourth I'm GNA cut this piece back we'll
[3656.96 - 3662.96] make a fourth right now okay there we go
[3660.80 - 3662.96] all
[3668.36 - 3673.84] right all right here we go I got some
[3672.00 - 3676.64] hardboiled
[3673.84 - 3680.64] eggs all right let's get some black salt
[3676.64 - 3682.00] out you guys ever do the black salt okay
[3680.64 - 3683.44] now what I'm going to do is put black
[3682.00 - 3685.48] salt in this
[3683.44 - 3688.16] bowl
[3685.48 - 3690.44] what I like about what what I like about
[3688.16 - 3690.44] black
[3690.76 - 3696.48] salt is it's not as high in
[3694.28 - 3698.56] sodium well it depends on which black
[3696.48 - 3699.84] salt it is don't quote me on that
[3698.56 - 3702.20] because there's different black salts
[3699.84 - 3703.64] out there all right there we go put a
[3702.20 - 3706.56] little bit of that in
[3703.64 - 3709.56] there
[3706.56 - 3713.44] okay all
[3709.56 - 3715.76] right now I'm going to take
[3713.44 - 3718.08] that hardboiled egg and I'm going to dip
[3715.76 - 3720.68] it in the black salt just like
[3718.08 - 3722.16] this you can do less black salt you can
[3720.68 - 3724.12] do more of it you want to just do a
[3722.16 - 3726.12] little touch to sprinkle it on it like
[3724.12 - 3728.96] for example see these three that's the
[3726.12 - 3731.28] way I did it right there for guests for
[3728.96 - 3733.72] family that's the three three hardboiled
[3731.28 - 3735.08] eggs just like that with the black salt
[3733.72 - 3736.16] you might want to do it this way you
[3735.08 - 3738.52] take some black salt and you just
[3736.16 - 3742.00] sprinkle a little bit on you don't need
[3738.52 - 3745.12] much that's it just like this little
[3742.00 - 3746.52] sprinkle right there and that's that's
[3745.12 - 3749.20] the one right there that's a hard-boiled
[3746.52 - 3751.20] egg you might desire
[3749.20 - 3752.72] okay now if you're somebody that's kind
[3751.20 - 3754.16] of laughing saying that's not an egg
[3752.72 - 3758.28] that's not an egg don't knock it till
[3754.16 - 3762.60] you try it do not knock it until you try
[3758.28 - 3766.64] it I'm going to be straight up on that
[3762.60 - 3768.48] okay because these are unbelievable
[3766.64 - 3771.08] these ones I'm going to put it now in a
[3768.48 - 3775.28] little on a little
[3771.08 - 3778.64] plate okay leave in a little bowl
[3775.28 - 3780.08] like this four hardboiled eggs coming
[3778.64 - 3785.08] right
[3780.08 - 3788.28] up nice there we go that's
[3785.08 - 3789.96] them now if you're somebody that's
[3788.28 - 3792.36] addicted to addicted to eggs and you
[3789.96 - 3794.60] have to have them every single morning
[3792.36 - 3796.56] realize this that your liver cannot
[3794.60 - 3798.76] cleanse it will not cleanse out the

[3972.36 - 3978.04] right that is one hot hot plate right
[3975.68 - 3980.32] there here we
[3978.04 - 3982.20] go what you see right there oatmeal
[3980.32 - 3984.12] cookies that could be a great medical
[3982.20 - 3987.44] medium morning cleanse option right
[3984.12 - 3989.24] there and it really is ooh these are
[3987.44 - 3991.64] really done nice too can I just give you
[3989.24 - 3993.16] a little closeup here personally I like
[3991.64 - 3995.00] them when they got a little bit of that
[3993.16 - 3996.72] brown when they're browned a little bit
[3995.00 - 3999.36] that that look do you see that look you
[3996.72 - 4002.68] guys right there you guys see that look
[3999.36 - 4003.96] right right how amazing is that look at
[4002.68 - 4007.20] these
[4003.96 - 4009.20] cookies these are oatmeal banana cookies
[4007.20 - 4011.08] there's no ins the resistance going on
[4009.20 - 4013.72] with this there's no blood sugar spikes
[4011.08 - 4016.24] going on with this because there's no
[4013.72 - 4017.84] oil oil in here to battle the sugar so
[4016.24 - 4020.48] when you're eating this this isn't this
[4017.84 - 4021.80] isn't about having that oil or that fat
[4020.48 - 4023.96] in here there's no peanut butter in
[4021.80 - 4025.56] these cookies there's no almonds there's
[4023.96 - 4027.00] no chocolate chips in these cookies
[4025.56 - 4028.96] that's the fat right there that will
[4027.00 - 4031.00] stop your morning cleanse so if you make
[4028.96 - 4033.20] your oatmeal cookie with chocolate
[4031.00 - 4034.40] chocolate chips there's no cleansing
[4033.20 - 4035.76] your liver is not going to cleanse it's
[4034.40 - 4037.32] not going to happen because the overt
[4035.76 - 4039.52] fat is going to make your liver go into
[4037.32 - 4041.16] overdrive and it's going to produce a
[4039.52 - 4042.52] lot of bile and it's not going to be
[4041.16 - 4044.60] able to actually cleanse it's going to
[4042.52 - 4045.92] be busy producing B
[4044.60 - 4048.88] so the whole point of the medical
[4045.92 - 4052.04] meeting morning cleanse is to not have
[4048.88 - 4054.96] to have your liver go into production
[4052.04 - 4057.48] and start producing too much bile to
[4054.96 - 4059.20] break down fats and when you actually
[4057.48 - 4061.64] stop that process where you stop your
[4059.20 - 4063.76] liver from having to break down for
[4061.64 - 4066.12] having to worry about breaking down fats
[4063.76 - 4068.32] and producing too much bile once you
[4066.12 - 4069.88] stop your liver from having to do that
[4068.32 - 4072.48] you give your liver a break where it
[4069.88 - 4074.88] could its only focus from there on out
[4072.48 - 4077.40] is cleansing out the poisons the toxins
[4074.88 - 4080.04] and the junk you want your liver to only
[4077.40 - 4081.92] have one Focus every morning and that's
[4080.04 - 4085.56] to clean out the
[4081.92 - 4088.48] poisons that's the Focus right there you
[4085.56 - 4089.72] want your liver to have one job one huge
[4088.48 - 4091.16] job yeah it's got a bunch of other
[4089.72 - 4093.76] little jobs it's working on too but you
[4091.16 - 4095.92] want it to focus on that one big job and
[4093.76 - 4098.52] that job is to release poisons and
[4095.92 - 4101.28] toxins and get them out of the body and
[4098.52 - 4103.04] it won't do that if you bring in an over
[4101.28 - 4104.52] fat in the morning you have coffee with
[4103.04 - 4106.48] cream done
[4104.52 - 4108.80] liver's not going to cleanse you have a
[4106.48 - 4110.52] smoothie with peanut butter in it done
[4108.80 - 4113.24] liver's not going to cleanse you're not
[4110.52 - 4114.60] going to move forward right you have
[4113.24 - 4116.84] oatmeal with a little peanut butter in
[4114.60 - 4118.84] it almond butter in it done your liver
[4116.84 - 4120.56] is not going to cleanse sorry you have a
[4118.84 - 4122.80] piece of chocolate before noon you piece
[4120.56 - 4124.48] of chocolate at 10: in the morning done
[4122.80 - 4127.08] your liver is not going to
[4124.48 - 4128.76] cleanse it's not going to cleanse if any
[4127.08 - 4130.40] of that's happening so this is critical
[4128.76 - 4133.24] to know you got almond milk in the
[4130.40 - 4135.32] morning done your liver is not going to
[4133.24 - 4137.40] cleanse you got oat milk in the morning

[4424.32 - 4431.04] one of a health author or influencer
[4428.36 - 4433.60] they're doing one thing year two they're
[4431.04 - 4436.08] doing another thing what happened the
[4433.60 - 4437.80] first thing didn't work year three
[4436.08 - 4440.44] they're doing something else did you you
[4437.80 - 4441.68] ever see that out there now they're
[4440.44 - 4444.56] doing something else they're selling
[4441.68 - 4446.48] something else what happened year four
[4444.56 - 4448.80] they're now into keto year five they're
[4446.48 - 4453.16] now into carnivore oh year six they're
[4448.80 - 4455.60] back into keto year seven they're vegans
[4453.16 - 4459.20] now all the health experts and authors
[4455.60 - 4462.00] to included right year eight they were
[4459.20 - 4463.84] eating tons of fat year nine they're
[4462.00 - 4467.24] staying away from fat for some reason
[4463.84 - 4467.24] cuz they heard about it from
[4468.52 - 4473.52] somewhere and I'm just saying year you
[4470.76 - 4475.16] know year one year two year three heck
[4473.52 - 4477.04] they do it every 6 months it's another
[4475.16 - 4478.88] change to change to something else let's
[4477.04 - 4480.88] take a look at this nice mango right
[4478.88 - 4483.68] here we'll see what we
[4480.88 - 4487.32] have I'm going to pop this on the
[4483.68 - 4488.56] plate okay you guys you ever see that
[4487.32 - 4490.44] you guys know what I'm talking about
[4488.56 - 4492.24] right but you know what's funny the
[4490.44 - 4494.20] medical medium information is consistent
[4492.24 - 4496.08] because guess what
[4494.20 - 4497.76] I'm not in charge of the medical medium
[4496.08 - 4500.32] information that's
[4497.76 - 4502.20] why if I was in charge I'd probably be
[4500.32 - 4504.04] doing the same old stuff everybody else
[4502.20 - 4505.12] does out there they're keto one minute
[4504.04 - 4506.44] then there's something else the next
[4505.12 - 4507.76] minute then they're like you could eat a
[4506.44 - 4510.00] little fish then they're like don't eat
[4507.76 - 4511.60] any fish they learn about heavy metals
[4510.00 - 4512.92] year two and they're like don't eat any
[4511.60 - 4515.36] fish but your first book said you could
[4512.92 - 4516.48] eat fish then year three they're doing
[4515.36 - 4517.88] something else then year four they're
[4516.48 - 4519.92] doing something else I would probably do
[4517.88 - 4523.56] the same thing the same stupid
[4519.92 - 4526.04] stuff if if the information was wasn't
[4523.56 - 4529.08] coming from above when it's coming from
[4526.04 - 4532.00] above it's it has to be what it has to
[4529.08 - 4532.00] be that's why there's no
[4534.72 - 4539.80] contradictions that's why you see
[4536.44 - 4542.84] consistency in the message for years and
[4539.80 - 4544.16] years and years 15 years 20 years going
[4542.84 - 4547.40] all the way back you see that
[4544.16 - 4547.40] consistency is there in the
[4548.08 - 4552.28] messaging it's just always there I'm
[4550.36 - 4553.80] going to pop in a few berries on this
[4552.28 - 4556.32] fruit plate
[4553.80 - 4556.32] it's like
[4556.76 - 4561.00] this I got some mangoes on here I got
[4559.28 - 4563.12] some
[4561.00 - 4565.20] watermelon and I'm going to pop in some
[4563.12 - 4566.92] orange some oranges if you guys don't
