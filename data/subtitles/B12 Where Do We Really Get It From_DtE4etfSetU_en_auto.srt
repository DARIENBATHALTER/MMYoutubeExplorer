63
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,280
people where

64
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,400
they're afraid about not getting their

00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:15,040
b12 and where did they get their b12 how

66
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,920
do they get their b12 it's a big fear

67
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,280
and i even say i even talk about it in

68
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,200
this episode you guys

69
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,760
i talk about that kind of thing

70
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:26,080
happening is like you you go plant-based

71
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,520
i'm a huge supporter plant-based uh

72
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,200
movement plant-based diets i'm a

73
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,640
supporter of animal-based diets too you

74
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,400
know clean animal-based diets too and

75
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,720
all that but the point is is that i feel

76
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,480
bad for the plant-based and vegan people

77
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:39,040
all these years i feel bad for them

78
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:42,160
because they get attacked with

79
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:44,160
certain tricks why trick or treat okay

80
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,840
you don't get it from meat because what

81
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,959
happens is they're being told once you

82
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,640

inspired by it

86
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,000
my friend got me hooked on it i read

87
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:59,040
something about it online

88
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,879

89
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,800

00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,480

people don't know

149
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:54,320
out there and it's really interesting

150
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,520
you guys have to hear the episode

151
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,600

152
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,600
more lots to cover about that but first

153
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,080
i wanted to remind you guys

154
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,759
did you listen to the brain fog episode

155
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,840
and did you listen to the neurological

156
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,039
symptoms episode

157
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,360
those are really important did you

158
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:12,400
listen to the apple cider episode

159
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:15,440
that's another one um

160
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:17,280
so joan says my b12 is off the charts i

161
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:20,479
take beverage b12 every day

162
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:24,800
you know what happens is that um it

163
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:26,960
it's it's best to have it you know high

164
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,960
and still do things for it and still be

165
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,720
proactive in doing things for it and

166
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,960
still take things for it you know i talk

167
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,560
to doctors all the time about this and

168
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,639
doctors are at a point really good

169
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,520
doctors out there now they reach out to

170
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,360
me and they want to

171
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,960
understand b12 and they want to know

172
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,720
what's going on because they don't teach

173
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,240
anything like that out there

174
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,080
you know it's like i had a doctor tell

175
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,880
me the other day that they don't teach

176
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:51,280
that in medical school about b12 and

177
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,720
where to get b12 from and if it's active

178
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:56,000
and usable is the b12

179
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,919
active is the is the b12 usable and

180
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,600
they don't even talk about that like how

181
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:03,120
does b12 work in the body

182
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,960
so it's so important um elena says you

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,599
am i gonna get acne now and if i don't

210
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:05,599
like all these questions it's fear and

211
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,840
chaos with with vegans and plant-based

212
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:10,800
people and i get it that

213
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,720
that you know look i get it's scary to

214
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,039
go plant-based for a lot of people and

215
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,880
so

216
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,960
the confusion's there but there's a

217
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,680
massive amount of confusion

218
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,240
regarding where we get b12 from our food

219
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,039
okay

220
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,440
so why would plant-based people be told

221
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,120
hey

222
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,400
you got you're not going to have any b12

223
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,479
you're not going to get any b12 from

224
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:31,759
your food why would they say that well

225
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:32,560
because fruits and the vegetables that

226
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,800
people eat

227
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,919
right including even leafy greens and

228
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,039
herbs you know

229
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:40,160
they don't have b12 in them so where are

230
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,560
you going to get it

231
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,199
because meat has b12 in that right mint

232
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,840
meat

233
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,120
chicken has b12 eggs has b12 but don't

234
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,560
get too excited because i want to tell

235
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,000
you something real quick

236
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:54,240
eggs have b12 and oysters

237
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,039
clams don't run out and eat a bunch of

238
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,800
oysters now

239
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:59,120
don't run out and eat a bunch of clams

240
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,080
now right and you know you just yeah

241
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,039
you'll get a lot of

242
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,680
toxic heavy metals right so anyway so

243
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,800
shrimp

244
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,080
has b12 so but the whole point is is

245
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,599
that b12

246
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:14,639
is not the b12 that our bodies

247
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,960
use or utilize that's the trick right

248
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,120
there

249
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,160
on its own so if you're an animal

250
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,400
protein person

251
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,280
right you know and you're like hey

252
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,879
you're vegan

253
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,599
you're not going to get b12 where are

254
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:28,319
you going to get it or if you're a

255
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:30,479
you know doctor that you know even if

256
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,640
even vegan doctors i talked to a vegan

257
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:34,320
doctor last week

258
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,159
that connected with me is like look i'm

259
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,560
a vegan doctor i'm plant-based doctor

260
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:39,599
my patients are mostly plant-based i

261
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,919
take care of

262
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,200
you know plant-based patients and all

263
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,760
this kind of stuff

264
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,880
and even he was like where did we get

265
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:50,240
our b12 i was like

266
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:53,440
huh what where you know

267
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,600
and i was telling them well first of all

268
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,760
where does a meat eater get their b12

269
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,120
and it's like well for meat right

270
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,959
you get it from meat you get it from

271
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,200
chicken get it from eggs

272
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,880
and i'm like no you don't you don't

273
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,680
that's why meat eaters

274
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,880
are also b12 deficient too so just for

275
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,440
the record

276
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,360
you know there's the majority of b12

277
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,720
deficient people are people who eat

278
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,160
animal products and this

279
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,000
i'm not against animal products or

280
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,760

you can plug it in if you want to be

289
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,560
plant-based it's just about how do we

290
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,640

291
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,560

293
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,320
diet or platform you're on right

294
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,320
you guys know that all about me medical

295
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,320
medium tools are saving lives around the

296
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,640
world that are both meat eaters

297
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,920
and obviously plant-based of course

298
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,000
right and

299
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,240
but anyway the whole point is is like

300
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,080
you can you can be low in b12 and be

301
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:57,040
eating meat chicken and eggs

302
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,399
and you can also have b12 in your system

303
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,160
from eating meat chicken and eggs but

304
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,839
that b12

305
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,200
doesn't mean it's working for you it

306
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:04,800
doesn't mean it's doing the things it

307
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,720
does for you and then we get sick down

308
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:09,279
the road and we start falling apart

309
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,640
things start going wrong we get viral we

310
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:13,600
have other issues

311
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:15,040
and then we get in trouble so the b12 is

312
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,640
important for us and it's

313
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:20,880
it's you know joan says following

314
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,839
um joan says mine is high also so your

315
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,880
b12 is also

316
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:26,399
high yeah and you can have high b12 now

317
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:29,279
when you hear the episode

318
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:31,279
you'll understand like word for words

319
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,959
you'll hear it you'll understand

320
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:35,040
like what happens when it's high what

321
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:36,880
does that mean is it good is it bad is

322
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,440
it working for you is it not working for

323
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,440
you

324
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,600
so we can't get tricked by that either

325
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:44,240
just because our b12 is high

326
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,120
doesn't mean we're utilizing it exactly

327
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,519
or utilizing

328
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,440
all of it from our food it doesn't mean

329
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,480
our food is made it was working for us

330
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,720
it's important

331
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:56,320

so that the deal is here

351
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,760
is about making sure that you know how

352
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,920
to protect yourself

353
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,000
and your family you know you might be

354
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,519
somebody that wants to stay plant-based

355
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,760
and but yet you're about to leave the

356
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,200
plant-based movement because you're told

357
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,480
where's your b12

358
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,040
you might be somebody that's eating

359
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:49,440
animal proteins but you're low in b12 or

360
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,200
even high in b12 but does that mean it's

361
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,880
working you're gonna have to

362
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,800
listen to the podcast if you can and

363
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,600
take a few minutes out from your busy

and listen and so you can learn about

366
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,120
that too just because

367
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,480
you got you're getting just because when

368
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,760
you get a blood test and it says oh your

369
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,000
b12 is normal

370
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,800
doesn't mean that's the b12 that's

371
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,880
actually

372
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:11,360
helping protect you so things don't go

373
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,480
wrong like you know skin issues and

374
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,240
other issues too

375
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,680
and a little bit of depression and all

376
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,440
these other stuff because what happens

377
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,440
is that b12 is critical for

378
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,560

thanks you're awesome um

469
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:08,000
dr fun the reference range for b12 is

470
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:10,480
also not good

471
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,360
so so just looking at the numbers isn't

472
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,519
enough

473
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,440
the brilliant man brilliant doctor i

474
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:18,560
know you're helping so many people

475
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:21,760
um incredible incredible

476
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:23,600
so when it comes down to b12 it's one of

477
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,320
those things that i don't want anyone to

478
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,959
overlook

479
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,160
it's this is one of those must listen to

480
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:30,720
episodes

481
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:32,240
because does your health matter does

482
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,920
your wellness matter does your

483
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,440
well-being does your emotional

484
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:38,320
well-being matter

485
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,279
and so there's when we're missing the

486
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,480
link

487
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:43,360
with b12 and not understanding it we can

488
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,720
get really in trouble

489
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,399

508
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:21,360

509
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:24,240

michelle says the podcasts are great

565
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:02,160
intensity is required

566
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,960
and they're they're intense these

567
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:07,200
podcast episodes are intense for sure

568
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,000
and i remember when the first episode

569
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,840
came out

570
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,520
i said to you guys you might not want to

571
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:14,000
hear this and i said that

572
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,600
and i was straight up straight up across

573
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,640
the board

574
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:20,320
like for real i was like you guys might

575
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,760
not want to hear this podcast

576
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:26,640
because this podcast is really intense

577
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:28,799
and over the top with with information

578
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,679
but more than that spooky too

579
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:32,880
in a way because when you drop truth

580
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,320
there's a lot of people that don't want

581
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,960

00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,559

644
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,679
i felt like the b12 one was important i

645
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,159
felt apple cider vinegar was important

646
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:43,919
because

647
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:46,080
you might be that one person that can't

648
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:48,000
move the needle because of that apple

649
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:51,039
cider vinegar and i have to think about

650
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,120
that of course all of that um

651
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:54,159
but you guys so this is a really

652
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:57,280
important one

653
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:59,840
link is in the description don't miss

654
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,720
this episode whatever you do share this

655
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,840
episode

656
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,320
so people can protect themselves and you

657
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,799
know

658
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,720
we talk about life being hard we talk

659
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:10,720
about how life's being challenging

660
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,080
now we talk about what's happening and

661
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,000
what's going on out there

who's talking about what we need to

664
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,799
protect ourselves so our nervous systems

665
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,600
don't

666
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:22,880
go downhill and just and fall apart and

667
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,200
so our mental

668
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:27,200

00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,799
