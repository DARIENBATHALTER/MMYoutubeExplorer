[0.06 - 5.34] see that what is that oh that's a lot of
[3.12 - 8.22] oil
[5.34 - 10.02] but why and where and how come it's in
[8.22 - 11.94] my nut Butters it's in all of your nut
[10.02 - 14.10] Butters that's right can't wait to give
[11.94 - 15.96] you the whole rundown on that this is
[14.10 - 17.66] going to be a really fun time look at
[15.96 - 21.60] that oh
[17.66 - 23.52] whoa what's up with that exactly you see
[21.60 - 26.04] that oil right there you guys are
[23.52 - 27.90] drinking all that oil uh-huh let's go
[26.04 - 32.16] into it a little bit so right here you
[27.90 - 33.42] guys this is the mm-1500 100 off and you
[32.16 - 34.92] guys know I work with the mega and
[33.42 - 37.98] everything when it comes down to being
[34.92 - 39.60] sick every little bit counts every
[37.98 - 41.52] little bit counts that means if you're
[39.60 - 43.20] going to eat a nut butter you want to
[41.52 - 45.60] make sure you're not totally being
[43.20 - 48.24] screwed over or taken advantage of or
[45.60 - 51.00] ripped off or your body
[48.24 - 53.58] being betrayed The Nut Butter companies
[51.00 - 55.62] are betraying people bottom line see
[53.58 - 57.48] that peanut butter that oil is not from
[55.62 - 60.42] those peanuts see that almond butter
[57.48 - 62.22] that oil is not from those almonds you
[60.42 - 64.92] can't see this is it isn't clear but
[62.22 - 67.02] it's an unopened tahini and the oil on
[64.92 - 69.24] top of that unopened tahini is not from
[67.02 - 71.88] those seeds I hate to give you the hard
[69.24 - 74.10] true but it's not this is one of the
[71.88 - 76.14] best lessons you guys can have because
[74.10 - 78.96] the oils that are placed in all the nut
[76.14 - 82.04] Butters declines your health this is a
[78.96 - 82.04] tahini right here
[84.54 - 89.10] take a look that is straight oil and
[87.06 - 91.38] that's not from your sesame seeds this
[89.10 - 92.64] is part of why people can't heal they
[91.38 - 94.50] think they're doing something good for
[92.64 - 96.90] themselves but they don't heal this is
[94.50 - 99.24] why vegans don't heal and they go back
[96.90 - 101.16] to eating eggs this is why vegetarians
[99.24 - 103.44] and people who are really mindful about
[101.16 - 105.30] their health this is part of why they
[103.44 - 107.40] don't heal it's simple things like this
[105.30 - 110.52] that they don't know that is pure
[107.40 - 113.04] straight oil but not from those sesame
[110.52 - 115.32] seeds in all the tahini bottles and jars
[113.04 - 117.42] that you guys have is added oil that
[115.32 - 120.36] comes from someplace else it's bulk
[117.42 - 122.28] cheap low-grade rancid oil it's in all
[120.36 - 123.84] your nut Butters and your tannies the
[122.28 - 126.12] oil you're looking at is not from those
[123.84 - 128.76] nuts or those seeds they're putting old
[126.12 - 130.92] rancid oil that comes from bulk nuts
[128.76 - 132.90] from around the planet it depreciates
[130.92 - 134.64] your health it's not good for your heart
[132.90 - 137.04] it's not good if you have chronic
[134.64 - 139.56] illness people are eating all the peanut
[137.04 - 142.32] butters all the almond butters all the
[139.56 - 143.94] tahinis all the cashew Butters all the
[142.32 - 145.80] hazelnut Butters and don't realize it
[143.94 - 147.66] they're drinking drinking oil that's
[145.80 - 149.40] declining and taking down their health
[147.66 - 151.50] and they don't even know it this is the
[149.40 - 153.42] death by a Thousand Cuts and that's why
[151.50 - 155.16] it is absolutely critical you learn how
[153.42 - 157.74] to make a nut butter what is the point
[155.16 - 159.66] of companies to put oil in their nut
[157.74 - 162.66] Butters confused while they add it
[159.66 - 164.22] because they use less nuts which cost
[162.66 - 168.18] the nut butter companies a lot of money
[164.22 - 171.96] they use less nuts but bring in cheap
[168.18 - 174.66] bulk oil that cost them pennies pennies
[171.96 - 177.06] and then they mark up the price of your
[174.66 - 179.64] nut butter jar stick it on the Shelf at
[177.06 - 184.02] Whole Foods or whatever food store and
[179.64 - 186.90] you pay for rancid old oil you can't be
[184.02 - 189.90] sure that they're just adding plain old
[186.90 - 193.02] oil the oil could have garbage in it
[189.90 - 194.91] crap in it it's bulk rancid old oils in
[193.02 - 196.20] every nut butter out there
[194.91 - 198.12] [Music]
[196.20 - 201.72] that's what nut butter is supposed to
[198.12 - 203.88] look like right there mm-1500 boom why
[201.72 - 206.64] should we even care about all that added
[203.88 - 210.00] oil I'll tell you why diminishes your
[206.64 - 212.82] health lowers your immune system burdens
[210.00 - 215.28] your liver and your heart heavy on the
[212.82 - 216.78] liver and pancreas so what I'm doing is
[215.28 - 218.76] putting it in these little jars and then
[216.78 - 220.50] I put a lid on it you might be able to
[218.76 - 221.64] see this on a close-up too it looks
[220.50 - 224.58] really cool
[221.64 - 226.62] so I'm packing it down with my hands my
[224.58 - 229.38] hands are clean I wasn't out at the post
[226.62 - 231.48] office or at the store or grocery store
[229.38 - 233.52] and I was opening up all kinds of doors
[231.48 - 235.26] out there and had my hands on the
[233.52 - 237.18] shopping cart and carriages and now I'm
[235.26 - 239.28] putting my hands in here so I can put
[237.18 - 240.96] all those
[239.28 - 242.88] little buggies that I picked up
[240.96 - 245.10] somewhere on my hands in here but no my
[242.88 - 247.70] hands are clean look at that you can put
[245.10 - 247.70] the lid on it
[247.92 - 253.76] boom when you make your own nut Butters
[250.32 - 253.76] it's a game changer
