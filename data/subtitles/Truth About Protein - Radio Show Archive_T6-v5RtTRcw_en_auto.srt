1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,240
hello I'm Anthony William and you're

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,920
listening to the medical medium radio

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,880
show where each week I talk about the

4
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:10,519
most advanced healing

5
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:12,920
information much of which is not found

6
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:15,559
anywhere else and is decades ahead of

7
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:17,480
what's out there now and that's how it

8
00:00:15,559 --> 00:00:18,880
has to be in order to heal because

9
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,480
what's going on in the alternative

10
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,000
environment for medicine in the

11
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,039
conventional environment for medicine

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,920
isn't really healing anybody well I

13
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:28,400
can't say that entirely people get a

14
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,359
little bit better there are some amazing

15
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,960
surgeons out there too that remove

16
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:33,559
things out of people's bodies if

17
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,840
somebody gets an appendicitis if

18
00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:36,960
somebody has an aneurysm there's

19
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:40,320
incredible surgeons so but I'm talking

20
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:44,079
about chronic illness that's where the

21
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:46,480
disaster lies it doesn't lie with with a

22
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:49,239
liver transplant we got amazing people

23
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,719
out there to to remove a liver put one

24
00:00:49,239 --> 00:00:53,320
in I mean you know we're in a great

25
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:55,000
place uh medical science and research is

26
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:57,480
in a great place when we're doing that

27
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,280
kind of thing but where are we with

28
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:03,519
chronic illness it's disastrous I'm

29
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:05,519
sorry to say but disastrous and the best

30
00:01:03,519 --> 00:01:08,400
information out there in the internet or

31
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:12,200
or in books or wherever you can find

32
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:14,360
isn't enough because we have 250 million

33
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:17,799
Americans alone and I'm not even talking

34
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:20,280
about global and and 250 million

35
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:22,079
Americans that are sick with symptoms

36
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,200
out of the over 300 million plus

37
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:25,960
Americans that we have here and that are

38
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,159
sick with symptoms and different

39
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:30,360
conditions many diagnosed wrong many

40
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,159
symptoms they don't no one

41
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,799
understands that's where we are with

42
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,159
chronic illness so does this radio show

43
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:38,000
have to be ahead of the time darn right

44
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,040
you better believe it has to be ahead of

45
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,960
the time and it has to be ahead of

46
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:45,200
everything else and it is and that's the

47
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:47,040
whole point this radio show it has clean

48
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,600
and pure information if you're brand new

49
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,200
to this in if you're brand new to this

50
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,320
radio show medical medium radio show and

51
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,680
everything else around it make sure that

52
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,320
you tell friends too that the

53
00:01:53,680 --> 00:02:00,399
information here is not backed by agenda

54
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:02,560
driven money stuff like that all that

55
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,759
crazy stuff that's in the industry like

56
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,719
the medical lobbyists and everything

57
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:08,879
else around it that are involved with

58
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:12,160
making sure that conventional medicine

59
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:15,040
is poisoned meaning as far as for

60
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,720
chronic illness and alternative medicine

61
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,120
is poisoned for chronic illness so that

62
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,879
when you go and you try to find help you

63
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,360
get told you got Lyme disease when you

64
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:24,720
may not have Lyme disease or you get

65
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,680
told you have multiple sclerosis when

66
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:30,080
you don't have multiple sclerosis or you

67
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:31,920
never get told what causes anything or

68
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,319
it it could be anything going on tingles

69
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,200
and numbness aches and pains blurry eyes

70
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:38,239
brain fog confusion then you're told

71
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,440
it's something in your gut when that's

72
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,360
not really what it is it's one thing

73
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,879
after another you got Ser there's people

74
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,640
out there walking around fatigue chronic

75
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:47,800
fatigue everywhere with all kinds they

76
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:50,640
can't do anything they all kinds of

77
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:52,800
symptoms weak Limbs and frustration

78
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,080
anxiety depression and not getting the

79
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,280
answers so when it comes down to that

80
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:00,080
science is behind and studies do not the

81
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,599
whole thing studies and research search

82
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,080
don't really match up to anything with

83
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:07,400
everybody's suffering from aches and

84
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,519
pains joint pain nerve pain neuropathy

85
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:12,239
everything going on all of it is still a

86
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:14,120
mystery migraines headaches you name it

87
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,640
have I said enough and that's still a

88
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:18,040
mystery to research and science it's

89
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:19,519
still a mystery to to most professionals

90
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,640
so this is pretty actually all

91
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,840
professionals really when you think

92
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,959
about it unless they know what's causing

93
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:27,760
everything now the reason why I'm saying

94
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,879
this and being so strong about all this

95
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,480
all of this is because we're going into

96
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:33,560
we're going into protein is where we're

97
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:35,879
heading and before we go into protein I

98
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:38,000
just have to let everybody know that the

99
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:39,959
information here in the show isn't

100
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,680
because I believe in one thing or I

101
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:43,280
believe in another thing or I got some

102
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,920
belief system and I'm going to I'm going

103
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,519
to shove a whole bunch of protein crap

104
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,280
right down your throat a whole bunch of

105
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:52,720
protein nonsense and knowledge down your

106
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,439
throat maybe science and and research

107
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,920
believes you need this amount of protein

108
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:57,599
I'm just going to take that and just

109
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,079
shove that right at you no we're not

110
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,840
going to do that we need the truth

111
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:04,239
instead we can't get tricked and we

112
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,319
can't get fooled because let me tell you

113
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,239
something when it comes down to the

114
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:10,680
protein and the protein whole phenomenon

115
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,159
to the whole Obsession and everything

116
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,720
about protein we're getting tricked

117
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:16,519
we're getting fooled if anybody's ever

118
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,199
played a trick on you you didn't like it

119
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:20,359
I can guarantee you that I'm sure you

120
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:22,680
didn't but if someone plays a trick on

121
00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:24,560
you and it's your whole lifetime and

122
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,040
your family's lifetime before you and

123
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,000
your mother and father's Lifetime and

124
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,639
your grandparents lifetime before you

125
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,440
and everybody else's lifetime before you

126
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:36,880
and after you your children and this the

127
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:38,759
same trick the same joke is being played

128
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:42,280
on your children and their children it's

129
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:45,919
not a good thing and the protein problem

130
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:47,199
is this very trick and that's the big

131
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,440
that's the deal so we're going to go

132
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,400
right into that we have to the

133
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:53,039
information that show is pure untampered

134
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:56,000
with it's not

135
00:04:53,039 --> 00:04:58,600
supported by the thumb on the scale

136
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,120
research and science that forces studies

137
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:03,720
to go a certain direction to take care

138
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,440
of investors that put their money in it

139
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,080
so everybody's happy except for the

140
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,280
person with chronic illness well we have

141
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:12,160
nothing to do with that and thank God

142
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,960
and I'm so darn happy we have nothing to

143
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,240
do with that and that's why people are

144
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:18,280
healing check out check out medical

145
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,600
medium books you know my books check out

146
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:23,520
the whole thing learn and heal and it's

147
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,360
really important to do that so let's go

148
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,319
right into protein look I sound a little

149
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,960
extra edgy today a little extra snarky

150
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:31,639
on this but there's there's a reason for

151
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:35,080
this because protein has been like it's

152
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:38,360
like the thorn in people's sides because

153
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:41,400
the minute you follow the protein law

154
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:44,560
the law of protein you get yourself

155
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:47,080
messed up you fall into a trap you fall

156
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,800
into a ditch you step into a pothole you

157
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:52,400
get yourself in big trouble and you have

158
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,560
to know this for your own good it's

159
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,639
critical because you have to protect

160
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,880
your family you have to protect your

161
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,080
friends you have to protect your loved

162
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:59,560
ones you got to protect yourself

163
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:01,440
whatever you got to do and the protein

164
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:04,319
machine I call it the protein machine is

165
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:07,479
an evil evil

166
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:09,639
machine it's an evil machine that

167
00:06:07,479 --> 00:06:12,800
doesn't that doesn't take hostages it's

168
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:14,840
an it's an evil machine that wants to

169
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,120
take people down it sounds crazy well

170
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:19,520
back in the

171
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:21,960
1930s okay the 1930s a deal was made in

172
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,199
the industries a deal you have no idea

173
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:26,039
about a deal that never gets surfaced it

174
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:27,960
never gets talked about and it doesn't

175
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:29,960
even get talked about with with all the

176
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,560
different food groups the food Wars you

177
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,280
got the Paleo people and the protein

178
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,880
eaters here you got the vegans you got

179
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,960
the vegetarians here and you got this

180
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:40,400
food War out there and everybody's like

181
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:42,440
trying to throw science reg garbled like

182
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:45,039
junk science just whatever it is just

183
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:47,000
throwing it back and forth you know the

184
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:48,360
Paleo people and the high protein people

185
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,639
are all like well you vegans you're

186
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,800
going to be starving and you need your

187
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,479
protein and where you're going to get

188
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,800
your protein and the vegans and the

189
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:56,879
plant-based people are all trying to

190
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,199
prove hey we got protein we're throwing

191
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:59,759
and you're eating all the animal meat

192
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:02,120

intense but everybody's keeping busy and

195
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,280
and their eye is on this protein ball

196
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,039
and they're passing this protein ball

197
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,440
back and forth back and forth some more

198
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,599
authors come out and write about the

199
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:16,319
same protein ball back and forth back

200
00:07:14,599 --> 00:07:18,680
and forth more experts come out and talk

201
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,639
about it on you know whatever TV shows

202
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:23,960

you get burned and no one knows about

205
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:34,919
the deal and the deals that have been

206
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:38,280
made in the past to make sure protein

207
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:40,479
confuses the crap out of you guys that

208
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:44,319
protein confuses the heck out of you

209
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:46,879

210
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,639
right and you end up staying sick

211
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:51,479
because the minute you got your eye on

212
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:53,000
the protein ball Hey look it's all about

213
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:55,199
protein look at the back of the package

214
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,520
it's protein ignore what what's really

215
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,759
in the food ignore what can actually

216
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,520
cure your illness because hey no one

217
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,000
knows it creates chronic illness anyway

218
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,280
so why how would you know unless you

219
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,759
read the medical medium books and

220
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:07,240
everything and if you don't then you

221
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:10,360
don't know what causes any disease or

222
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:12,759
illness so there you go and so what

223
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:15,280
happens is we end up just lost in the

224
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:17,720

this topic I've been staying away from

242
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:55,440
it there's a reason why because it's

243
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,360
that annoying it's so annoying I almost

00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,440
for protein how are you going to get

261
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,360
better if you're searching for protein

262
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:39,399
to be your answer when you're walking

263
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:41,560
around sick and you go to a new doctor

264
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:44,279
and I'm not listen I'm not picking on

265
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:45,720
the doctors you know that you know that

266
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:47,320
you know how I am I know a lot of

267
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:49,720
doctors I love doctors that's not the

268
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:51,120
problem is at all it's just unique the

269
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,160
doctors can't help what's being taught

270
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,920
to them that's all it's as simple as

271
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:58,320
that it's like a whole bad school it's a

272
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,760
whole big bad school out there in health

273
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,399
and there's everybody goes to it and

274
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,480
files in and learns what they learn and

275
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:07,800
what they learn is old old old deals

276
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:11,640
that were made old deals that were made

277
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:15,800
hear me out hear me out okay back in the

278
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:19,079
1930s all right protein came to town it

279
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:21,320
was like Santa Claus coming to town and

280
00:10:19,079 --> 00:10:24,000
this wasn't no friendly nice good Santa

281
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:27,120
Claus this was a Santa Claus with big

282
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,800
contracts of tons of paper tons of paper

283
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,680
contracts that sit in vaults that you

284
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,399
don't even have your hand you couldn't

285
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:36,560
even touch these contracts no way in

286
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:39,600
hell it's called grandfathered contracts

287
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:42,360
in business to make sure protein was

288
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:45,639
literally the focus in every institution

289
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:48,519
school every medical school every single

290
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:51,519
school from elementary school across the

291
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:53,920
country to everywhere possible protein

292
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,839
was a new word where did you get your

293
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,040
protein if you're going to grow and

294
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,360
you're going to drink some milk you're

295
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,320
going to get protein out of your milk

296
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:02,000
you're going to grow strong bones and

297
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,720
strong muscles so you better get your

298
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,839
protein and these deals were made they

299
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:10,440
were slimy greasy disgusting deals that

300
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:12,760
were made in the old day where money was

301
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:15,720
passed from one person to another and it

302
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:18,360
institutionalized as protein being God's

303
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:21,160
answer to everything and you know what

304
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:23,760
else was happening but 1940s early

305
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:25,440
1940s everybody was filing into doctor's

306
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,880
office of sick left and right for the

307
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,320
first time in history to this degree

308
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:33,360
where women were find in in like armies

309
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:35,360
of women were coming in with anxiety

310
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,360
depression for the first time in the

311
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:40,600
1940s they were coming in with mystery

312
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:42,639
symptoms like never before I've talked

313
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:45,399
to old doctors I remember in the '90s

314
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:47,760
cuz I was doing this in the 90s and I

315
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:49,680

323
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:04,680
the '90s

324
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:07,959
okay back then and they were in their

325
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:09,399
'90s they had a history of knowing what

326
00:12:07,959 --> 00:12:12,240
happened in

327
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:14,320

333
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:25,160
doctors in the in back then okay and

334
00:12:23,959 --> 00:12:26,680
they said they couldn't believe it it

335
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:30,639
was like they woke up in morning they

336
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:33,480
had their coffee they Dr drove to work

337
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:35,279
okay in their old the old cars the old

338
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:38,279
Buick or whatever they had they drove to

339
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:41,040
work they got there and there was a line

340
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:43,360
at the door it was that fast they said

341
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,120
they've never seen anything like it and

342
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,120
they only had a couple of fallbacks to

343
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,720
go on because when they looked for help

344
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,639
from research in science research in

345
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,760
science said tell them they need protein

346
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:55,120
tell them maybe they're not getting

347
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:57,519
enough protein if that doesn't work tell

348
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,560
them they're crazy and it's all in their

349
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:02,079
head tell all the women they're crazy

350
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:04,560
and it's all in their head and if that

351
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:06,600
doesn't work okay tell them it's

352
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,160
hormones because science and research is

353
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,440
manufacturing hormones for the first

354
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,480
time now we're going to need to sell

355
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:14,120
them you see what I mean we've been

356
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:16,320
duped in so many ways we've been smacked

357
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:18,920
in the heads in so many ways we don't

358
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,240
even know we don't even

359
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:24,360
know and meanwhile everybody was coming

360
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:26,880
in due to DDT poison mercury poisoning

361
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:29,279
heavy metal intoxification they're

362
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,920
coming in because of Epstein early bar

363
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:32,240
viruses were finally hitting the fan

364
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,920
which you got to learn about in thyroid

365
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,880
healing you got to read that book front

366
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:39,399
to back to really know about the Epstein

367
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:40,920
bar and and they know it's not out there

368
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:43,440
the information that's out there that's

369
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:45,360
sadly not out there yet and don't get

370
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,000
fooled when science when somebody puts

371
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:50,320
out a little thing and they say oh seven

372
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,160
seven diseases that that are linked to

373
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:55,000
Epstein bar don't get fooled by that

374
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:58,480
they're just trying to derail you once

375
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,959
again it's not linked it's act the EP

376
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,959
bar is is the cause of these diseases I

377
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,199
talk about all the time don't get fooled

378
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:06,800
by that information that you see

379
00:14:04,199 --> 00:14:08,959
floating around that's another to try to

380
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:12,759
derail the progress that we've made you

381
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:15,279
and I have made so what happens with the

382
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:18,320
protein ball everybody's passing that

383
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:20,560
baby around now everybody's passing that

384
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,480
around and that thing is still in the

385
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,959
way that means that if you're doing

386
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,519
something right for yourself you're

387
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:26,759
going to end up doing something wrong

388
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,199
for yourself CU you're going to be

389
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:29,560
thinking protein someone's going to tell

390
00:14:28,199 --> 00:14:31,800
you did you get enough protein and

391
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:35,079
you're going to derail your

392
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:36,839
process that's how it works that's how

393
00:14:35,079 --> 00:14:38,040
it works so let's talk about protein and

394
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:40,360
different light I'm giving you the

395
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:42,040
history of protein with the dirty deals

396
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:43,959
the dirty deals that are made going all

397
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:46,680
the way back the old dirty deals you

398
00:14:43,959 --> 00:14:49,959
better believe it going all the way back

399
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:52,040
protein has a nasty business behind it

400
00:14:49,959 --> 00:14:55,000
I'm just telling you and a lot of money

401
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:57,680
to be made off of it in the past and a

402
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:01,279
hell of a lot of money is made off of it

403
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:02,600
now because it's an endless topic and no

404
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:04,839
matter you know and I'm not even going

405
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:07,160
to be able to stop it it's like the lime

406
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:08,800
disease thing the truth about Lyme

407
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:11,000
disease I talk about in book one in

408
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,160
medical medium book one the truth about

409
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,079
lme disease is in there okay about how

410
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:16,800
it was originally viral it is viral it

411
00:15:15,079 --> 00:15:18,160
still is viral even though there's some

412
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,639
bacteria present and I talk about how

413
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,800
the lime labs are all messed up and

414
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:22,399
everything else and I talk about all

415
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,480
this stuff like it's all there if you're

416
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,240
getting upset and you got Lyme disease

417
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:29,240
just get the book and read it and give

418
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,880
it a chance so you can protect yourself

419
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:33,160
but I'm never going to be able to stop

420
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,959
the lime train I don't think the lime

421
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:36,639
trap that's out there there's too many

422
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:38,440
Labs too many doctors they're all

423
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:40,639
working together no one knows what's

424
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:42,399
going on and it's just too big and I

425
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,120
don't think I can change the course of

426
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:47,560
that one and I don't think I'll ever

427
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:50,279
change the course of the protein mistake

428
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:52,120
either but you know maybe I'm just wrong

429
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:54,319
and maybe we are going to change the

430
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:55,800
course on the protein thing finally

431
00:15:54,319 --> 00:15:57,440
maybe it's possible and the same thing

432
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:59,839
with the lime thing possibly I mean we

433
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,199
know we've gotten thousands and tens of

434
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:03,480
thousands and tens of thousands of

435
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:05,560
people better with Lyme disease we know

436
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:07,959
that already so maybe we are changing

437
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:10,399
the course but listen to

438
00:16:07,959 --> 00:16:12,959
this when it comes down to protein it's

439
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:15,440
so big it's such a big

440
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:17,560
giant that even when you hear the show

441
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,560
and you listen to the show and you got

442
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:21,399
the straight you got the straight and

443
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:23,319
narrow you you know what it is you know

444
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:24,600
what's going on about protein you

445
00:16:23,319 --> 00:16:26,160
understand what's going on with protein

446
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,759
you're still going to bump into a wall

447
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:30,680
possibly because it's that riddled with

448
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:32,720
misinformation out there about protein

449
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:35,000
and there's that much protein fear and

450
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:38,120
there's that much it's in it's literally

451
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,440
passed down a generation now since 1930

452
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:44,800
and and you can't you can't even you

453
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:46,759
can't even get around it and so it's it

454
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,160
hits everybody it's like when women are

455
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:50,000
pregnant is are you getting enough

456
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,680
protein first of all protein isn't even

457
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,839
what takes care of the baby when you're

458
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,120
pregnant it's not even the very thing

459
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:56,680
it's minerals it's nutrients

460
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,560
phytochemicals and food it's

461
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:01,440
antioxidants those are the things that

462
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:04,160
develop a baby it's carbohydrates that

463
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:06,280
develop a baby it's all these other

464
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:09,039
things that develop a baby and then the

465
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:11,319
baby's liver develops its own protein

466
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:13,039
too which is the key see that's the

467
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:16,000
whole thing you need all these other

468
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:17,720
things in Foods so that your own liver

469
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,600
which science and research doesn't even

470
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:23,559
know about creates your proteins the

471
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:26,480
ones that the body accepts as actual

472
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:29,600
protein to do the things that science

473
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:32,840
theorizes that the body May do with

474
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:35,880
protein your liver and by the way Liver

475
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:37,520
Rescue is it's on its way it is on its

476
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:40,160
way so you got to check that out go to

477
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:42,080
Amazon and check it out I did everything

478
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,440
I did everything for that book I don't

479
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:46,679
even know what I didn't do I didn't put

480
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:48,960
just the kitchen sink in there I mean I

481
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:52,360
put a bathtub in there there's a bathtub

482
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:54,720
in that book it's it's it's insane it's

483
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:56,960
unbelievable okay so so that's what

484
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,679
happens so research and science doesn't

485
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,400
know what the liver does it it just

486
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:02,720
doesn't the liver has thousands of

487
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,640
chemicals chemical functions thousands

488
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,559
one of them is producing proteins so the

489
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,080
body can identify those proteins and use

490
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:11,600
them that's one thing okay that's where

491
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:14,760
we get our proteins the most but eating

492
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:17,799
Foods eating foods that heal and feed

493
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:20,000
the liver eating foods that take care of

494
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:22,360
us that give us all these other things

495
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,320
can then allow the liver to create

496
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:28,000
proteins we need undiscovered proteins

497
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:29,200
the liver creates hundreds of proteins

498
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,880
hundred

499
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,360
that have the function that function

500
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:35,880
that are used for the body to function

501
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,240
with and it has even nothing to do with

502
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:41,400
food or what's in

503
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:44,640
food except the right Foods the right

504
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:47,120
Foods lots of fruits and vegetables help

505
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:50,080
the liver perform its

506
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:52,600
functions so see what I mean that's how

507
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,559
unbel that's how butt backwards we are

508
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:56,480
that's how butt backwards we are

509
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:58,640
unbelievable and it's even more than

510
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:01,880
that there are protein sources in food

511
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:03,520
yes and they are helpful they are

512
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,679
helpful but there's harmful ones too and

513
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,919
I'm going to cover that so you guys

514
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:07,440
we're going to cover that of course you

515
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:08,960
know which ones they are I'm sure you

516
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,880
know so we're going to cover those

517
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:13,720
different harmful ones but there's

518
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:15,960
helpful ones the proteins and spinach

519
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:17,640
really good for us really good just make

520
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:20,400
sure it's raw spinach make sure it's not

521
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:22,919
cooked it has to be raw spinach it's a

522
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,440
really high protein Source Nori you know

523
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:27,080
when you have your Nori wraps your Nori

524
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:28,559
rolls the sushi rolls but the the Nori

525
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:30,000
rolls and you put whatever you you put

526
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:31,520
avocado in there and you put some

527
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,600
cucumber in there and some celery and a

528
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:36,600
little tomato you wrap it up and you cut

529
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:39,080
it in slices and you put it nicely on a

530
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:40,400
tray so that's that's something right

531
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:42,960
well there's lots of protein in the

532
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:45,200
norish sheet and we can't get confused

533
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:48,480
protein's not supposed to satiate hunger

534
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:50,320
the reason why we look for animal

535
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,480
proteins and this is an A bash on animal

536
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,720
protein I'm going to tell you right now

537
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,320
I'm going to tell you straight up right

538
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:58,720
here this isn't propaganda against

539
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:02,120
animal the animal protein War world and

540
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:05,159
this isn't propaganda against the vegan

541
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:07,120
World okay you have to understand this

542
00:20:05,159 --> 00:20:09,240
for sure because a lot of people even

543
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:11,280
when I explain myself like that you

544
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:13,320
should see some people are just like oh

545
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,080
he's just he's he's throwing propaganda

546
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:17,760
against the vegans oh he's throwing

547
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:20,799
propaganda against the meat eaters no

548
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:24,440
I'm not I'm not at all here's how it

549
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:26,799
works there's fat that's with protein

550
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:29,120
that's how it get satiated so if you're

551
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:30,919
a vegan you're eating so many nuts and

552
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,640
seeds and so many cashews and it's okay

553
00:20:30,919 --> 00:20:35,159
to eat some nuts and seeds it's okay to

554
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:37,280
eat eat some uh pumpkin seeds and some

555
00:20:35,159 --> 00:20:41,159
flow seeds it's okay to use a little bit

556
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:43,960
of olive oil extra virgin olive oil cold

557
00:20:41,159 --> 00:20:46,880
pressed it's okay and same thing with

558
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:48,080
the animal products it's okay if you

559
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,440
that's what you like and that's what

560
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,960
you're feeling good and you got no

561
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,480
problems and your liver's nice and

562
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:55,120
strong and you want to eat some animal

563
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:58,159
protein of some kind it's okay to have

564
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:59,840
some animal protein but remember there's

565
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:02,919
fat in these

566
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:06,159
proteins and they can't be

567
00:21:02,919 --> 00:21:07,880
separated so what we get satiated on

568
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:12,039
which makes us think we need more and

569
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:14,880
more protein is we get satiated on that

570
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:16,880
fat content and guess what that fat

571
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:20,120
content that's in a ton of nuts will

572
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:23,159
kill your liver it will kill your

573
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:25,799
liver because you it's that the high fat

574
00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:29,320
diet is the problem that's the problem

575
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:31,520
and no one wants to address that on any

576
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:33,279
level the high I'm not talking about the

577
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,240
trans fatty acids I'm not talking about

578
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:37,400
you know some some crazy fast food

579
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:39,279
restaurant that's got it's got the fryer

know and you get pancreatitis from it

585
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:51,880
I'm not talking about those bad fats or

586
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:54,520
the the bad fats and some cupcake that's

587
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:56,240

popular and mainstream that's sitting on

talking about those no no no no no no

595
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:15,520
way I'm talking about what happens when

596
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,120
you eat too much animal protein too much

597
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:19,880
too much you're eating meat for

get you'll end up with diabetes down the

601
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,240
road no matter what I don't care how

00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:40,440
one apple that's how stupid things are I

610
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:43,799
have to say that word I can't help it

611
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:45,760
it's idiotic here's the thing here's the

612
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:47,600
thing okay same thing with the vegans

613
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,840
doing the plant you guys I know so many

614
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:52,000
of you guys are plant-based listen to me

615
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:54,919
I I I adore you I totally support it one

616
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,720
billion percent but I got a lot of

617
00:22:54,919 --> 00:22:58,840
plant-based people and and they can't

618
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,559
eat any fruit because they're so busy

619
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:01,960
eating so much of the other stuff

620
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:03,480
they're eating two avocados three

621
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:05,520
avocados a day then they're having a

622
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:07,880
whole bunch of nuts and seeds they're

623
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:10,279
eating two tablespoons of coconut oil a

624
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:12,480
day they're putting in their smoothies a

625
00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:14,159
whole like almond butter left and right

626
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,960
and this isn't just the plant-based

627
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:20,520
people even the people that are lowering

628
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:22,320
animal protein don't eat right so even

629
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:24,400
there you know some of the doctors out

630
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:27,320
there that are prancing around with new

631
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:29,799
ideas saying oh yeah I still eat animal

632
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:31,679
protein but you got to lower it and and

633
00:23:29,799 --> 00:23:33,640
but what you got to do is still focus on

634
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:35,320
high fat lots of fats fats are good for

635
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:38,279
the brain they're good for the brain no

636
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:41,279
they're not terrible for the brain

637
00:23:38,279 --> 00:23:43,000
terrifying for a brain what's not been

638
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:46,480
discovered by research and science is

639
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:49,400
people have fatty brains they have fatty

640
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:52,279
brains just like fatty liver just like

641
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:55,440
fatty liver and that's what kills people

642
00:23:52,279 --> 00:23:58,360
too that's what kills people too you

643
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:01,080
know that expression Fathead yeah it's

644
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:03,679
legit it's real no one knows it or

645
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:06,360
realizes it but it's real the brain can

646
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:10,279
get fatty the brain itself the liver

647
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:12,440
gets fatty so even the fancy books that

648
00:24:10,279 --> 00:24:14,200
are out there now with misinformation

649
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:15,440
left and right because of a theory or

650
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:17,240
because of a belief system that they're

651
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,559
going to just shove down your throat

652
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:21,120
even those that say oh but no high Fat's

653
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:23,440
still great yes you got to start lower

654
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:25,320
your animal protein but high fat you

655
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,799
still want more lots of avocados and you

656
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:28,919
want all these all all this almond

657
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:30,360
butter straight right into your smoothie

658
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:32,039
every morning and you don't want to eat

659
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:34,360
too much fruit stay away from those

660
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:36,679
sweet fruits it's ridiculous in fact it

661
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:38,120
set sends you down to not healing and

662
00:24:36,679 --> 00:24:39,840
here's the problem if you're working on

663
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:41,320
your healing process and you're ebbing

664
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,559
and flowing because of the natural

665
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:45,720
healing process or because your

666
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:47,399
supplements that you're on maybe you're

667
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:49,000
on the wrong supplements or something or

668
00:24:47,399 --> 00:24:50,840
maybe whatever and you start taking a

669
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,960
turn for a second you're going to think

670
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:54,799
it's protein you're going to instantly

671
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,520
blame even if you're on a good diet

672
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:58,399
you're going to blame it and that's a

673
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:00,080
whole another disaster if you're on a

674
00:24:58,399 --> 00:25:02,440
good diet you're going to blame that

675
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,640
good diet as being a protein problem and

676
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:05,240
you're going to shuffle around to

677
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:07,440
another diet and then to another belief

678
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:08,399
system then another ideology another

679
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,679
you're just going to be moving and

680
00:25:08,399 --> 00:25:13,120
moving around and cheating yourself at

681
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:15,320
getting better classic and I see it all

682
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:17,640
the time it's painstaking it's painful

683
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:19,640
reason why I put Liver Rescue out there

684
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:21,200
is because of this it's just because of

685
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:22,559
this reason this is one of the reasons

686
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:25,480
you need to know what's going on inside

687
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:26,799
the body and what to do including

688
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:29,240
supplements and everything around

689
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:31,440
supplements so here's the deal okay I'm

690
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:33,279
going to be straight up all right if

691
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:36,080
you're eating animal protein there's

692
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:37,760
some to avoid some you can have that

693
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,240
won't kill your liver and you got to do

694
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,559
it in moderation depending on where you

695
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:42,799
are with your sickness if you're eating

696
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:44,480
plant-based you're eating vegan there's

697
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:47,080
there's some nuts and seeds you can have

698
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,720
some avocado you can have some little

699
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,960
coconut oil you can have you can also

700
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,440
have that if you eat meat and you could

701
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:54,240
also have that you don't but the point

702
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:56,200
is all the fats got to come down a

703
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:58,000
little bit you got to make a conscious

704
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:01,880
effort to bring them down a little bit

705
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:06,360
bit that's the key it has nothing to do

706
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:09,039
with protein at all proteins put there

707
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:09,799
so you you don't even know how much fat

708
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:12,880
you're

709
00:26:09,799 --> 00:26:15,320
eating that was one of the key things

710
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,960
because what happened was and just so

711
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:18,360
you know the fats the the government

712
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,200
standards of fats and all this you know

713
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:21,640
if you look at the stats on fats how

714
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,919
much fats are in the food how much fat

715
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:24,399
are in a piece of meat how much Fat's in

716
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:26,039
a piece of chicken how much Fat's in a

717
00:26:24,399 --> 00:26:28,120
nuts you know they're all wrong do you

718
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:30,679
know they're all wrong every Farm is

719
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:33,799
different every single animal is

720
00:26:30,679 --> 00:26:35,200
different they're completely wrong to

721
00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:36,919
the degree of how much Fat's and

722
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,159
everything and everybody knew it at the

723
00:26:36,919 --> 00:26:41,799
get-go all the way back they got you

724
00:26:39,159 --> 00:26:44,600
focused on the protein so nobody eats

725
00:26:41,799 --> 00:26:47,880
healthy enough and the reason why they

726
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:50,480
do that is so the industry keeps sick

727
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:53,760
people filing in left and right because

728
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:56,320
it's a massive trillion trillion dollar

729
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:59,600
machine that's grandfathered in with

730
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:01,919
contracts and deals made over centuries

731
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:04,960
and you guys are all Pawns in the game

732
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:07,080
man all Pawns in the game if you play

733
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,159
with the protein train if you want to

734
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:11,120
ride the protein train you're going to

735
00:27:09,159 --> 00:27:13,520
be part of that whole game I'm not

736
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:15,960
trying to rhyme here it's just happening

737
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:17,240
naturally okay I'm not a rhyme I'm not a

738
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:21,640
good

739
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:23,720
rhyme so all right look the bottom line

740
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:25,520
is when you think protein you got to

741
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:27,240
instantly think of fat that's all think

742
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:29,320
of fats okay wait a minute no wait a

743
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:32,039
minute fats how much how many fats are

744
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:34,640
in my diet and you got to lower them a

745
00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:38,679
little bit I don't care what illness you

746
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:40,960

muscles breaking down I don't want all

794
00:29:12,519 --> 00:29:16,960
of that

795
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:19,640
happening but it will if you're focused

796
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:22,679
on protein it

797
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:24,880
will even if you're an athlete and

798
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:27,039
you're in your 50s and you're working

799
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:29,440
out and you don't seem to have a scrap

800
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:31,360
effect on your body if you're focused on

801
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,880
protein you can set yourself up for a

802
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:36,799
heart attack from Hell a heart attack

803
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:38,440
from hell I see it all the time I've

804
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:41,799
witnessed it all the time I've seen

805
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:43,600
people drop dead out there in the world

806
00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:45,320
I talk to people and they're like I

807
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:48,440
can't believe how many people are

808
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:50,519
dropping dead joeo is dropping dead this

809
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:51,600
other person Saras Su dropped dead

810
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:53,240
they're all just they're all just

811
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:55,320
dropping dead out there heart attacks

812
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:56,760
Galore oh what were they eating I don't

813
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:59,240
know they seem to be healthy they were

814
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:01,039
exercising they were doing low carb they

815
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:03,720
were they were taking care of themselves

816
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:07,120
I don't you know the whole bit the whole

817
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:08,799
bit now In fairness to the plant-based

818
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:11,760
people and fairness to the vegans and

819
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:14,000
plant-based people okay there's a double

820
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:15,840
standard out there and I feel bad for

821
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,600
the plant-based people because here's

822
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:22,279
the deal all the meat eaters are allowed

823
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:23,960
to be sick because guess what out of 330

824
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:26,039
million Americans or whatever it is just

825
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:27,919
say it's 330 million Americans I I don't

826
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:29,760
know the number don't quote me on it

827
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:31,720
don't say hey we got him he doesn't even

828
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:33,200
know the number of am I'm just saying

829
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:36,720
okay I don't quote me on that there's

830
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:39,799
three 330 million Americans out of them

831
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:43,840
300 29 million

832
00:30:39,799 --> 00:30:47,159
900 whatever okay whatever it is and if

833
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:51,600
you want to go percentage you know it's

834
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:54,960
99 something something per meat eaters

835
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:56,840
meat eaters okay just letting you know

836
00:30:54,960 --> 00:31:00,000
and I don't mean meat any kind of animal

837
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:01,480
product theaters plant-based people it's

838
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,840
just a fraction you think there's a lot

839
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:06,679
of them no it's a real small just such a

840
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:09,159
small amount it's so tiny it's utterly

841
00:31:06,679 --> 00:31:11,720
ridiculous and if one plant-based person

842
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:13,399
one vegan gets sick or has a symptom or

843
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:15,679
they're they're wafering back and forth

844
00:31:13,399 --> 00:31:17,320
with a with a with some kind of problem

845
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:18,840
because they have a virus or something

846
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:20,840
else that has nothing to do with what

847
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:23,399
they're eating and they get they don't

848
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:24,679
feel well the meat eating world just

849
00:31:23,399 --> 00:31:27,279
comes down on them it's a double

850
00:31:24,679 --> 00:31:28,639
standard but we're not allowed you you

851
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:29,919
know what I mean we're not allowed and

852
00:31:28,639 --> 00:31:31,519
that's the whole thing we shouldn't do

853
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:33,840
that we shouldn't be allowed to come

854
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:35,039
down on the plant-based people we we

855
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:38,000
shouldn't be

856
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:40,799
allowed to come down on the on the

857
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,720
plant-based people the vegan people we

858
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:44,600
shouldn't be that we shouldn't we're not

859
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:47,279
supposed to be doing that jumping on

860
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:49,440
them and we're not allowed to do that

861
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:51,840
the thing is is the vegans they're not

862
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:53,880
allowed to jump on the the the animal

863
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:56,720
protein people when they get sick

864
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:58,880
they're not they're not and you know but

865
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:00,760
the thing is is the animal people the

866
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,320
animal protein people they jump on them

867
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:03,840
they SC they they try to crush the

868
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,399
vegans and the plant-based people oh

869
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:07,600
it's because you're not getting protein

870
00:32:05,399 --> 00:32:10,480
oh it's and I got to say all fairness

871
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:12,360
that's terrible that's terrible because

872
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:15,200
there isn't any vegans really it's a

873
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:16,679
small crew and vegans are only vegans

874
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,799
for a little while they're not vegans

875
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:20,159
for 30 40 years I mean they maybe people

876
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:21,799
are vegan for a month and then they're

877
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:24,039
off of it maybe people are vegan for a

878
00:32:21,799 --> 00:32:26,519
year they're off of it there's not many

879
00:32:24,039 --> 00:32:28,840
so you can't they can't be judged in all

880
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:33,320
fairness that's uncool it's uncool to be

881
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:37,840
judging that when there's or

882
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:39,880
329 million animal protein of some sort

883
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:42,639
some kind of animal protein

884
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:44,360
eaters and what about all the sickness

885
00:32:42,639 --> 00:32:45,919
that's the majority of the country and

886
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:48,919
and they're all sick out of the when I

887
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:51,240
say there's 250 million Americans that

888
00:32:48,919 --> 00:32:52,799
are sick that and there is I'm telling

889
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:55,679
you right now don't get confused by

890
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:57,039
television don't get confused by TV

891
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:58,880
because you see some people that look

892
00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:00,360
look healthy on TV because they're hired

893
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,799
for a commercial or whatever it is don't

894
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:04,279
get confused by that there's over 250

895
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:06,799
million sick

896
00:33:04,279 --> 00:33:08,799
Americans and you know how you got to

897
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:11,440
understand it's all the animal protein

898
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:14,480
years but I'm not just saying that's why

899
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:17,000
they're sick I'm saying and that's where

900
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:20,399
we have to clear this up right now I'm

901
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:23,120
saying it's because of the high fat diet

902
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:25,559
the high fat diets the too much fat in

903
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:27,159
the diets it's not about the animal

904
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:29,320
protein really in the end it's it's

905
00:33:27,159 --> 00:33:31,639
about the fat and in the vegans when

906
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:33,799
vegans get sick they're on way too much

907
00:33:31,639 --> 00:33:35,440
fat too so the small amount of vegans

908
00:33:33,799 --> 00:33:36,760
it's a small crew it's a really small

909
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:39,279
crew out there you don't think it is

910
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:42,440
it's small believe me and that small

911
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:44,720
crew they they they're on high fat diets

912
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:47,799
too and they get

913
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:49,320
sick and there's both sides are looking

914
00:33:47,799 --> 00:33:52,720
for

915
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:54,240
protein that's what I'm trying to say so

916
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,799
you got to be really careful you got to

917
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,840
lower the fats what does that mean if

918
00:33:55,799 --> 00:34:00,480
you're plant-based you got to keep the

919
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:02,679
avocados where it's like one a day you

920
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:04,240
know maybe even a half of avocado a day

921
00:34:02,679 --> 00:34:06,360
maybe it's a handful of nuts and seeds

922
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:08,200
in between and the rest lots of fruits

923
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:09,520
salads if you're if you're you know if

924
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:12,000
you do some cooked food you can do

925
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:13,839
potatoes sweet potatoes winter squash

926
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,879
you can do all that if you're raw you do

927
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:17,200
lot extra bananas and dates with salads

928
00:34:15,879 --> 00:34:18,520
and greens and you make sure you get

929
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:20,200
your celery juice in we're going to talk

930
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:22,320
about rebuilding muscle too so just hang

931
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:23,720
in there for this ride hang in there

932
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:26,200
okay I hope this show is interesting

933
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:28,200
enough I hope it's interesting enough

934
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:31,119
cuz I I want you guys to know all this

935
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:32,760
stuff okay and if you're doing animal

936
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:35,480
protein you got to bring you can't be

937
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:39,000
eating meat three times a day I've never

938
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:41,639
seen anything good ever come out of in

939
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:44,359
all my years and I'm not anti-animal

940
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:46,599
product person and all I'm telling you

941
00:34:44,359 --> 00:34:50,960
right now I'm not one and I've never

942
00:34:46,599 --> 00:34:52,760
seen anything good I swear to God out of

943
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:55,200
out of eating animal protein of some

944
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:58,040
kind three times a day never seen

945
00:34:55,200 --> 00:35:01,440
anything good come out of it it I I'm

946
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:03,720
telling you right now ever ever and if

947
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:05,440
you say someone lived to be 85 and ate

948
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:08,200
animal products three times a day they

949
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:12,040
would have lived to be 118 then if they

950
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:14,520
didn't because the fat shortened them to

951
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:17,200
85 and when it comes down to diseases

952
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:20,000
the very re real causes of illness and

953
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:23,240
disease that I outline in my books you

954
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:25,880
guys outline in the books which is all

955
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:29,640
the viruses which is all the heavy

956
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:32,880
metals you can't get heavy metals out of

957
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:34,960
the body in its entirety if your fats in

958
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:37,400
your diet are too high both animal

959
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:40,839
protein side and both vegan side and

960
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:44,480
plant-based side okay you can't get the

961
00:35:40,839 --> 00:35:47,680
heavy metals out of the body you can't

962
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:50,599
get the viruses out of the body easily

963
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:52,480
if your fats are too high and that means

964
00:35:50,599 --> 00:35:55,240
you're searching for protein and getting

965
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:57,200
yourself in trouble with fat how many

966
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:58,760
shows like doctor shows where another

967
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,760
guy comes on he's like here's how you do

968
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:02,480
your smoothie you put your almond butter

969
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:05,400
in there and you throw this and you

970
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:07,920
throw your just a few blueberries in

971
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:09,400
there a few cultivated blueberries in

972
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,839
there and you put those in there and

973
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,839
you're just like and you're blending up

974
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:14,359
this big fat smoothie right on one of

975
00:36:12,839 --> 00:36:15,960
the doctor show and you're just like

976
00:36:14,359 --> 00:36:18,240
okay let's keep on teaching people to

977
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:19,920
eat nice and lots of fats and then then

978
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:22,119
you come across and you show the table

979
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:24,040
it's like ban Meats oh which is all fat

980
00:36:22,119 --> 00:36:26,599
still all fat when you think oh whole

981
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:28,000
lean proteins it's all fats or say it's

982
00:36:26,599 --> 00:36:30,119
a different person coming up on some

983
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,640
weird doctor show and it's like oh let's

984
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:33,400
lots of nuts and see coconut oil should

985
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:35,839
be doing two tablespoons of coconut oil

986
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:36,960
and lots of tahini and everything else

987
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:38,240
because whoa you're going to need lots

988
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,280
of HEI for your protein and you're going

989
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:42,079
to be all these protein Powers all the

990
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:44,040
the different protein powers and you're

991
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:45,000
going to get in trouble you're going to

992
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:47,119
get in

993
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:50,160
trouble because what's really happening

994
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:51,880
is we got viruses eating people up all

995
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,200
the symptoms I mentioned ear early on

996
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:56,319
all the symptoms and all the diseases

997
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:57,880
Hashimoto thyroiditis multiple sclerosis

998
00:36:56,319 --> 00:36:59,359
this go goes on and on and on these are

999
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:01,240
just a couple of things that I randomly

1000
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:02,680
mention all the time lupus whatever and

1001
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:04,560
all of them there's but tons and tons

1002
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:07,240
and tons of autoimmune conditions eximus

1003
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:09,800
Rises everything else all of it from all

1004
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:12,040
the different UTI from all the different

1005
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:14,240
migraines to everything under the sun

1006
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:17,800
there's pathogens and metals behind it

1007
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:21,040
and it has nothing to do with protein

1008
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:23,880
God Almighty it has nothing to do with

1009
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:26,240
protein that's how demented this joke

1010
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:29,079
has gone too far and how demented this

1011
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:32,160
joke is is and how far it's gone does

1012
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:34,200
anyone know how far it's gone it is

1013
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:37,280
disgusting and I'm telling you right now

1014
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:40,000
it's not over I could sit here and rant

1015
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:42,640
all I want on a soap box I could be like

1016
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,440
okay step right up and just come on

1017
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:46,119
here's a Golden Ticket of Truth take the

1018
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:47,440
golden ticket of Truth and still

1019
00:37:46,119 --> 00:37:48,680
someone's going to smack it out of my

1020
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:51,440
hand because you know what I can't

1021
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:52,520
control the world haven't you realized

1022
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,920
that too that you can't control the

1023
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,960
world but you know what we can do we can

1024
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:57,640
change the people around us and the

1025
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:59,680
people we meet and we can change

1026
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:02,440
ourselves and we can heal and help heal

1027
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:06,200
others and you know what you know what

1028
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:10,280
you save one person one person and that

1029
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:14,280
is their world that is their world

1030
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:18,560
remember that that is their world you

1031
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:19,960
save one person from misinformation and

1032
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:21,520
stupidity out there in the in the

1033
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:23,880
industries alternative and conventional

1034
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:26,960
you save one person and you save one

1035
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:29,040
child you save one Grandma you save one

1036
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:32,680
person you just save their world

1037
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:35,000
regardless of how idiotic the world can

1038
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:36,599
be that you can't control and that's the

1039
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,920
power of what we're doing and that's the

1040
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:40,000
power of what you're doing and that's

1041
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:42,079
the power that's what it all

1042
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,760
is so there's all these things that

1043
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:45,920
create disease and illness and symptoms

1044
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:47,720
and nobody cares nobody knows anything

1045
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:50,000
about and the ones that do care say you

1046
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:55,040
need more protein to fix it you believe

1047
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:57,240
that do you believe that yes it's still

1048
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,800
going on you walk in into the best

1049
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:00,400
functional doctor and I love all the

1050
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:02,720
functional doctors but you walk into

1051
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:05,800
them and and oh I probably need new Pro

1052
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:08,280
more protein and it's not their fault

1053
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:10,240
God bless them because they're still

1054
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:12,920
helping people in different ways all our

1055
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:15,640
doctors do every last one of them still

1056
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:17,720
help us in every way and they have

1057
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:18,839
compassion and they care that's why they

1058
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:20,160
woke up in the morning and said I'm

1059
00:39:18,839 --> 00:39:21,960
going to go to medical school I'm going

1060
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:24,119
to go and torture myself through that

1061
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:26,960
whole process and then sit in an office

1062
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:29,760
somewhere why people file in when I

1063
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:33,880
could be doing something else with my

1064
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:35,960
life because they care because they care

1065
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:39,520
so that's why it's a big deal but what

1066
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:42,119
happens is we get thrown the wrong wrong

1067
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:43,640
place down the we get thrown into like

1068
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:45,720

00:39:55,400 --> 00:40:00,880
unbelievable talking about crap people

1075
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:03,200
are trying to H hang their hat on why do

1076
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:06,640
I get upset about this because it

1077
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:08,440
hinders your healing it slows down your

1078
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,880
healing it's going to mess you up so

1079
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:11,200
what do you eat what do you do how do

1080
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:12,400
you eat I'm sure all these questions are

1081
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,160
coming through first of all there's

1082
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:16,359
plenty of protein you can't stay away

1083
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:18,599
from it it's in everything you can't you

1084
00:40:16,359 --> 00:40:20,240
eat a potato and the bioavailable

1085
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:22,960
protein just in the skin alone and

1086
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:24,520
inside the potato itself is more healing

1087
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:26,880
than some of the pro all the proteins

1088
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:29,640
out there in the world but potatoes are

1089
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:32,119
shunned that's what I'm talking about

1090
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:34,359
there's there's protein and tomatoes

1091
00:40:32,119 --> 00:40:35,880
proteins that people don't understand

1092
00:40:34,359 --> 00:40:37,839
yet that science and research don't

1093
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:40,079
understand because what they confuse you

1094
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:42,440
with purposely is the dirty deals went

1095
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:44,520
on in the 30s and the 1940s that were

1096
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:46,520
married to right now and don't even know

1097
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:48,640
we don't even know what we're married to

1098
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:51,160
that's how sick it is and this is the

1099
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:53,079
deal and these and these grandfather

1100
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:55,119
laws that we're attached to that we have

1101
00:40:53,079 --> 00:40:57,640
no idea what they are they're geared so

1102
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:59,440
we get confused that we think satiation

1103
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:01,760
has something to do with protein it has

1104
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:04,319
nothing to do with protein satiation

1105
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:06,920
satiation has everything to do with

1106
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:10,520
carbohydrate with calories and that part

1107
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:13,880
is right it's calories satiate also

1108
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:18,119
mineral salts satiate mineral salts and

1109
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:21,599
calories satiate hear me out glucose

1110
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:22,720
carbohydrate mineral salts satiate

1111
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:25,240
that's what

1112
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:28,000
satiates that's what that's what takes

1113
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:32,200
care of hunger but they purposely

1114
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:34,839
poisoned the water so that you think fat

1115
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:36,560
that fat protein that protein satiates

1116
00:41:34,839 --> 00:41:38,760
because proteins are always they always

1117
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:42,520
got fat involved with them and they

1118
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:44,440
satiate and then we get confused it has

1119
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:46,599
nothing to do with that and then they

1120
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:50,440
throw away your potatoes they throw away

1121
00:41:46,599 --> 00:41:52,720
your tomatoes with hip trendy crap that

1122
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:54,800
circulates just when we make progress

1123
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:56,560
they throw away your fruit we finally

1124
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:58,599
make progress that fruit fruit is

1125
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:01,520
healing people and it really is and they

1126
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:04,640
throw at another trendy person paid for

1127
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:06,560
by God knows what fruit fear and do you

1128
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:08,480
know all got got people that are they're

1129
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:10,160
not even paid off they're just following

1130
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:12,720
other people that were paid off 20 years

1131
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:14,560
ago that were the that were the plants

1132
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:16,200
that were the moles and they were put

1133
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:18,440
into the system alternatively and

1134
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:20,559
conventionally so so fruit fear went

1135
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:22,720
down the line so that people who aren't

1136
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:24,400
paid off go and write a book about you

1137
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:26,319
know stay away from all that Sugar stay

1138
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:28,280
away from all those fruits you got got

1139
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:32,280
to be on your protein it's

1140
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:36,559
unbelievable what's going on out

1141
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:38,800
there yeah take a sigh take a sigh so

1142
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:41,920
what can you eat you just can't you can

1143
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:44,160
eat lots of things but you can't think

1144
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:45,520
about protein as you're eating you're

1145
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,280
going to get in trouble there's protein

1146
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:49,040
and

1147
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:52,559
bananas for God's sake there's protein

1148
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:54,240
and bananas and a b bananas satiate they

1149
00:42:52,559 --> 00:42:55,800
satiate because of because of the

1150
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:57,440
calories coming from the carbohydrate

1151
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:59,119
and banana which is really healing which

1152
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:01,800
actually kills viruses and bacteria in

1153
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:05,440
the gut which actually heals Celiac

1154
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:07,640
Celiac it heals IBS bananas heal Crohn's

1155
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:09,520
and Colitis I've had the worst Crohn's

1156
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:11,440
cases ever out there and I've dealt with

1157
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:13,040
them and I've gotten people to to avoid

1158
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:15,680
surgeries and everything else Under the

1159
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:18,839
Sun with silly

1160
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:22,440
bananas bananas even repel retroviruses

1161
00:43:18,839 --> 00:43:25,200
like HIV bananas repel herpetic virus

1162
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:26,599
like all the H all the hhv sixs and

1163
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:28,760
sevens and eights and

1164
00:43:26,599 --> 00:43:30,720
undiscovered and in the nines and the 10

1165
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:32,520
and 11s and 12 14s and 15s that are

1166
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:34,839
undiscovered by research in science and

1167
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:36,359
so many herpetic mutations over 60

1168
00:43:34,839 --> 00:43:38,040
varieties of Epstein bar I talk about

1169
00:43:36,359 --> 00:43:39,160
all my books if you don't have my books

1170
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:41,079
got to get the books because I don't

1171
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:43,599
cover all that in these shows there's no

1172
00:43:41,079 --> 00:43:45,319
way I can there's no way I can if you

1173
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:46,599
read it once read the book again you'll

1174
00:43:45,319 --> 00:43:50,400
you'll realize there's a whole bunch of

1175
00:43:46,599 --> 00:43:52,359
stuff you missed and and and the deal is

1176
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:55,240
is that you know everything's got

1177
00:43:52,359 --> 00:43:57,040
proteins everything oranges have some

1178
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:59,000
protein apples have have protein and

1179
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:01,000
they're all proteins yeah they got them

1180
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:04,040
in there and they do play some role in

1181
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:05,559
the body but what really plays a role is

1182
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:07,359
keeping your liver healthy so your liver

1183
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:09,319
can create all the proteins you need

1184
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:12,040
that's the whole point a dying liver you

1185
00:44:09,319 --> 00:44:14,520
age you bombard your liver with loads of

1186
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:17,079
fat you bombard your brain with loads of

1187
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:19,240
fat and you age oh so you hear about

1188
00:44:17,079 --> 00:44:20,960
science that there's fats oh the megas

1189
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:22,559
are good for the brain that fats are

1190
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:25,079
everything for the brain that's what you

1191
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:27,800
heard let me tell you something there's

1192
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:30,520
a micros opic percentage of fat in the

1193
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:33,280
brain the rest is made out of glycogen

1194
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:35,160
storage hardened which is which is

1195
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:38,280
actually a positive thing with this

1196
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:40,920
because it's hardened glycogen that's

1197
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:43,119
how our brains stop atrophying and stay

1198
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:44,720
alive and stay vibrant and don't shrink

1199
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:48,160
when we get older it's from

1200
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:50,839
carbohydrates from stored glucose in the

1201
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:55,040
form of glycogen the brain is this

1202
00:44:50,839 --> 00:44:58,559
jellyfish of sugar with very low traces

1203
00:44:55,040 --> 00:45:00,319
of Omega so low and small without

1204
00:44:58,559 --> 00:45:02,400
because the more fat in the brain the

1205
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:04,920
more the more Metals will stay in the

1206
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:07,480
brain the more fat in the brain the more

1207
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:09,319
the more viruses can breed in the brain

1208
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:10,960
the more the more trouble the more

1209
00:45:09,319 --> 00:45:12,400
calcifications crystallizations in the

1210
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:14,440
brain black spots white spots on the

1211
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:15,440
brain lesions on the brain you name it

1212
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:18,480
can

1213
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:20,720
develop all of that with fatty brain

1214
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:23,200
that's right you heard it here first you

1215
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:24,880
heard it here first bet a whole bunch of

1216
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:26,880
copycats out there in the book world are

1217
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:28,200
going to want to come out with all this

1218
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:29,599
stuff when you know the whole thing when

1219
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:31,160
medical medium's putting out this liver

1220
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:32,920
book to try to make sure that you guys

1221
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:34,160
heal in every way in every capacity you

1222
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:35,319
better believe a whole bunch of people

1223
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:38,520
are going to try to counter it with

1224
00:45:35,319 --> 00:45:39,559
their their idea of what they think the

1225
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:41,599
liver

1226
00:45:39,559 --> 00:45:43,079
does and they'll and you know what one

1227
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:44,800
of those ideas is I'm going to tell you

1228
00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:46,280
right now the industries both

1229
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,839
alternative and conventional think that

1230
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:51,760
Fat's good for your liver even though

1231
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:53,680
fatty liver is caused by Fats is that

1232
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:55,160
amazing the industries right now

1233
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:58,160
alternative and conventional believe

1234
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:59,800
that sugar is bad for your liver and I'm

1235
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:01,400
not talking about table sugar that's not

1236
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:03,079
good for anybody and there's a reason it

1237
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:05,000
was separated in such a way I'm talking

1238
00:46:03,079 --> 00:46:07,119
about the sugar that's naturally derived

1239
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:09,119
but it's naturally sitting in all the

1240
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:12,760
fruits and here's the thing you want to

1241
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:14,640
build muscle it's not built on protein

1242
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:17,680
muscle's not built on protein muscle's

1243
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:19,520
built on three things hear me out here's

1244
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:21,480
your golden ticket giving you the golden

1245
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:24,280
ticket do you want it three things

1246
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:26,559
muscle is built on mineral salts that's

1247
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:28,040
one thing mineral salts lots of celery

1248
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:29,520
juice whether you're working out whether

1249
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:32,280
you're an athlete whether you're sick in

1250
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:34,640
bed atrophying because you're so sick

1251
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:36,680
you better stop the atrophying by using

1252
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:39,440
celery juice mineral salts stop the

1253
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:41,880
muscles from atrophying they also remove

1254
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:44,319
the toxins in the way from the muscle

1255
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:46,079
cell expanding and building so your

1256
00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:48,319
muscle tissue can build when you get

1257
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:51,359
mineral salts in your muscles which is

1258
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:53,760
celery juice and then you guys and then

1259
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:56,720
the second thing the second thing which

1260
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:59,640
is critical is carbohydrates not fats

1261
00:46:56,720 --> 00:47:01,880
not proteins carbohydrates fats stop you

1262
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:06,200
from building muscle they stop you from

1263
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:08,520
building muscle they do they do

1264
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:11,240
carbohydrates carbohydrates that's what

1265
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:14,760
builds muscle because guess what muscle

1266
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:18,880
cells can only be built on glucose

1267
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:21,319
entering into it with a nutrient because

1268
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:23,440
glucose attaches to all nutrients when

1269
00:47:21,319 --> 00:47:25,119
you eat a banana the glucose from banana

1270
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:28,040
attaches to all nutrients to drive it

1271
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:29,480
into the muscle to build a muscle okay

1272
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:31,480
that's the second thing and I'm being

1273
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:34,480
light on this there's more I could add

1274
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:35,839
the third thing is using your muscle so

1275
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:37,400
if you're sick and chronically ill in

1276
00:47:35,839 --> 00:47:39,200
bed and all you can do is lift up a

1277
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:41,240
glass you're building muscle by lifting

1278
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:43,520
up a glass if you're getting enough of

1279
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:45,000
the fruit in you enough of the potato in

1280
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:46,640
you things that have the carbohydrate

1281
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,160
and you're lowering your fats you know

1282
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:49,920
what gets people chronically ill really

1283
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:51,040
in trouble when they're in bed and all

1284
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:52,480
their doctors and all their family

1285
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:54,000
members like they need protein they're

1286
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:55,480
waing away they're atrophying they're

1287
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,559
sick in bed nobody knows what's wrong

1288
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:58,000
with them come on maybe they got Lyme

1289
00:47:56,559 --> 00:48:00,040
disease maybe they got this maybe they

1290
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,440
got that maybe got Ms whatever it is but

1291
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:04,119
they're viral as heck and they're loaded

1292
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:06,200
with viruses they're suffering the poor

1293
00:48:04,119 --> 00:48:08,040
things I've seen it for years it's

1294
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:10,200
horrible and you know and then they're

1295
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:12,359
being thrown fat diets lots of protein

1296
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:14,359
and fat being thrown in them atrophying

1297
00:48:12,359 --> 00:48:16,079
them when they need to be getting on

1298
00:48:14,359 --> 00:48:17,960
some bananas they need to be getting on

1299
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:21,400
potatoes they need to be getting on

1300
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:24,680
maybe some steamed peas steamed

1301
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:26,680
peas okay that's what I'm talking about

1302
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:28,200
those are the things that matter and you

1303
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:29,440
know why protein powders now the P

1304
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:31,280
protein powders you know why

1305
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:33,079
bodybuilders that eat animal protein but

1306
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:34,760
they hop on a p protein powder that's

1307
00:48:33,079 --> 00:48:37,359
actually a carbohydrate in there that's

1308
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:38,599
what gives you muscle and you know those

1309
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:40,040
you know those other you know there's

1310
00:48:38,599 --> 00:48:41,839
other there's people that say wait a

1311
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:43,480
minute if muscle doesn't get built on

1312
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:45,079
protein I'm on an all protein diet I'm

1313
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:46,160
on no carbohydrates how come I'm

1314
00:48:45,079 --> 00:48:47,920
building muscle that's because they are

1315
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:49,839
on carbohydrates they're in the protein

1316
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:50,960
shakes and powders they's SE sugars in

1317
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:52,640
them they're hidden in there that's how

1318
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:54,599
they do it they have to put sugar in

1319
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:59,280
these protein powders I know this for a

1320
00:48:54,599 --> 00:49:01,880
fact I know this for a fact they have to

1321
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:04,559
if they don't you're going to hit the

1322
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:06,440
wall you're going to hit the wall it's

1323
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:08,319
critical and and I'll tell you right now

1324
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:09,799
the one apple you do eat every 3 days if

1325
00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:11,319
you're on a low carb diet and a high

1326
00:49:09,799 --> 00:49:12,960
protein diet the one apple you eat every

1327
00:49:11,319 --> 00:49:14,720
3 days is going to actually be what your

1328
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:16,359
muscles are sucking up and absorbing so

1329
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:18,440
you can build a

1330
00:49:16,359 --> 00:49:20,760
muscle and then you use your muscle you

1331
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:22,920
build a muscle don't think about how

1332
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:24,319
many protein grams you need a day how

1333
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:25,280
many grams of protein you need a day

1334
00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:26,599
you're just going to get yourself in

1335
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:27,760
trouble you're going to walk into walls

1336
00:49:26,599 --> 00:49:30,079
you're going to step on potholes and

1337
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:31,559
you're going to get yourself in trouble

1338
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:32,839
you just got to be eating enough fruits

1339
00:49:31,559 --> 00:49:34,440
and vegetables and you got to make sure

1340
00:49:32,839 --> 00:49:35,480
you're lowering your you're if you're

1341
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:37,200
okay let's let's hit it if you're

1342
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:38,960
hitting if you're doing animal proteins

1343
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:40,760
do it once a day if you love animal

1344
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:42,520
proteins do it once a day that's right

1345
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:45,680
you're hearing it from me do it once a

1346
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:47,000
day do your salmon once a day absolutely

1347
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:48,240
if you like your grass-fed beef and

1348
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,960
that's what you really feel good on do

1349
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:51,680
it once a day the reason why people feel

1350
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:53,720
like they need a protein a lot of times

1351
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:55,960
too is if they're only eating salads

1352
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:57,280
with not enough carbohydrates in them or

1353
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:58,599
not enough calories in them they're

1354
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:59,880
eating some salads and they're eating a

1355
00:49:58,599 --> 00:50:01,440
little piece of fruit here and there and

1356
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:02,799
they're on this like diet or they're on

1357
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:03,720
the cleanse which is amazing to help

1358
00:50:02,799 --> 00:50:05,520
them heal they'll feel like they're

1359
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:07,280
hitting the wall and they need 4 oz

1360
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:09,000
steak or 4 oz piece of chicken or a 10

1361
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:10,839
oz piece of chicken because they're

1362
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:13,079
looking for calories and chicken has

1363
00:50:10,839 --> 00:50:15,359
it's so high in calories the protein

1364
00:50:13,079 --> 00:50:19,119
isn't what fills you up or satiates you

1365
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:21,480
I said it earlier it's the

1366
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:22,920
calories it then that's what does it so

1367
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:25,119
you have to bring your potatoes in your

1368
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:27,079
sweet potatoes your winter squash you

1369
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:28,760
have to start your your steamed brussel

1370
00:50:27,079 --> 00:50:31,359
sprouts you got to start bringing in

1371
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:33,040
some some dense calories and you got to

1372
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:34,480
be doing your spinach soups you got to

1373
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:36,119
throw your spinach you know I talk about

1374
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:37,839
medical median book one into the blender

1375
00:50:36,119 --> 00:50:39,720
and blend it up with some tomatoes and

1376
00:50:37,839 --> 00:50:41,160
you make yourself a nice rich spinach

1377
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:42,720
soup and you got to be eating enough

1378
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:44,240
fruit you got to get your papay out you

1379
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:47,440
got to get your you eat a few bananas

1380
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:49,559
and a few dates you'll get satiated and

1381
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:51,400
you'll be able to heal if you're eating

1382
00:50:49,559 --> 00:50:52,760
animal protein go to one Ser if you're a

1383
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:54,720
big animal protein person go to one

1384
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:56,520
serving a day if you're a big vegan big

1385
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:59,200
into IND plant-based and that's your

1386
00:50:56,520 --> 00:51:01,240
whole thing absolutely I support it go

1387
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:03,040
down drop your nuts and seeds in your

1388
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:04,319
oils though bring them down have a

1389
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:05,799
handful here and there and make sure you

1390
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:07,760
get a lot more of the fresh fruits and

1391
00:51:05,799 --> 00:51:09,559
vegetables do melon in the morning gets

1392
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:12,960
lots of celery juice but both sides of

1393
00:51:09,559 --> 00:51:16,000
the aisle I swear to God both sides of

1394
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:17,880
the aisle are so busy battling over the

1395
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,160
protein war and really honestly the

1396
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:20,599
plant-based people and the vegan people

1397
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:23,799
they're taking the fall they take the

1398
00:51:20,599 --> 00:51:25,400
hit because there's not a lot of them so

1399
00:51:23,799 --> 00:51:27,400
as they're healing and reversing their

1400
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:29,119
diseases and changing people's lives get

1401
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:31,079
a whole bunch of angry I mean it's a

1402
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:33,240
double standard in that it's

1403
00:51:31,079 --> 00:51:36,240
unbelievable what happens but both sides

1404
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:38,559
of the aisle both sides of this C the

1405
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:42,160
camps two camps out there Hatfields and

1406
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:44,079
The McCoys both sides are playing around

1407
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:47,599
with a volleyball with protein written

1408
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:50,680
on it and they're both getting suckered

1409
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:53,040
suckered suckered suckered it's so sad

1410
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:54,760
and so so really you're only going to

1411
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:56,119
hear this from me and it's the only time

you're ever going to hear hear it you're

00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:00,520
about it in the liver book though but

1415
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:02,720
I'm saying you're only going to hear it

1416
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:04,280
like this like this in this radio show

1417
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:07,079
because you know what I don't want to

1418
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:10,440
waste my time on the stupidity of the

1419
00:52:07,079 --> 00:52:13,240
protein problem it's almost nauseating

1420
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:15,720
but I realize something you guys need

1421
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:17,960
this information so I have to just I

1422
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:19,760
just have to chill and I have to chill

1423
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:21,760
and realize I just got to give you what

1424
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:23,400
you need I've always lived by that I

1425
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:25,680
can't stop because of protein's that

1426
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:27,079
annoying I got to deliver and I got to

1427
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:29,000
stay delivering and that's what the

1428
00:52:27,079 --> 00:52:30,559
medical medium radio show is all about

1429
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,240
well that's what I'm about as a soul as

1430
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:34,680
an individual and that's what spirit's

1431
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:37,799
about is I have to follow spirit's

1432
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:40,400
information because it's pure untampered

1433
00:52:37,799 --> 00:52:43,160
with clean source of information that

1434
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:45,200
wasn't paid off by somebody somewhere

1435
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:47,760
down the line and the thumb wasn't put

1436
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:50,280
on some scale and it was twisted so that

1437
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:52,400
our human Minds get all twisted up with

1438
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:56,200
it and we don't heal and we don't get

1439
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:58,599
better okay so how much protein do you

1440
00:52:56,200 --> 00:53:00,559
need I wouldn't even think about it it's

1441
00:52:58,599 --> 00:53:02,599
everywhere in every food you eat you

1442
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:05,359
just think about are you getting enough

1443
00:53:02,599 --> 00:53:07,119
carbs are you getting enough calories

1444
00:53:05,359 --> 00:53:08,200
and I'm not talking about from a donut

1445
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:09,359
I'm not talking about from that and I'm

1446
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:11,720
going to tell you right now if you're

1447
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:13,480
into eggs kill the eggs whatever you do

1448
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:15,359
I should have mentioned that early on

1449
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:17,359
kill the eggs the eggs are a protein

1450
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:19,359
Source no matter what for vegetarians or

1451
00:53:17,359 --> 00:53:23,480
whoever it is vegetarians animal eaters

1452
00:53:19,359 --> 00:53:25,799
whatever eggs are bad they're bad they

1453
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:27,160
feed every virus every disease every

1454
00:53:25,799 --> 00:53:28,920
bacteria that science of research

1455
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:30,400
doesn't even know about or understand or

1456
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:32,960
haven't even understand or discovered or

1457
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:35,520
research and that are the real reasons

1458
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:37,920
why you're sick it's not protein it's

1459
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:40,960
because of things that

1460
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:42,599
feed things like viruses and disease and

1461
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:43,880
guess what too much protein and you're

1462
00:53:42,599 --> 00:53:45,200
worried about too much protein and you

1463
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:47,119
want to eat that much protein you will

1464
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:49,599
feed these viruses and eggs is one of

1465
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:50,960
them you lower your animal products down

1466
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:52,400
you get rid of your eggs you get rid of

1467
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:54,559
your dairy products you lower things

1468
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:56,319
down and you heal and the plant-based

1469
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:58,200
people watch the the nuts watch the nuts

1470
00:53:56,319 --> 00:53:59,640
and seeds too too many I don't want to

1471
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:00,880
make you paranoid have a handful here

1472
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:03,960
and there but make sure you're getting

1473
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:06,480
all the other things and that's critical

1474
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:08,359
too that's critical but don't focus on

1475
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:09,720
protein you guys try not to but you know

1476
00:54:08,359 --> 00:54:10,960
what I could say that a million times

1477
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:12,200
and you know what I'm going get that

1478
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:13,200
that golden tickets can to get smacked

1479
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:16,640
out of my hand you're probably going to

1480
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:19,200
smack me in the head at the same

1481
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:21,760
time because it's out there to the point

1482
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:23,599
where you can't even dial something in

1483
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:26,040
the computer dial something how do you

1484
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:28,240
