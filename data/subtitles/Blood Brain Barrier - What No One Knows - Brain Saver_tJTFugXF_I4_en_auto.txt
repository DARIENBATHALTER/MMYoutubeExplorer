[526.08 - 529.56] you're not allowed to do that did you
[527.46 - 532.02] know that
[529.56 - 533.76] you're not allowed to do that you get in
[532.02 - 537.06] trouble you're not allowed to do that
[533.76 - 539.82] because it's a mob out there
[537.06 - 542.82] it's legit you have to have that and we
[539.82 - 546.00] don't do that all right nobody knows how
[542.82 - 548.52] the inner or inner workings work
[546.00 - 550.44] it costs to print the book and the
[548.52 - 553.38] publisher has to distribute them around
[550.44 - 556.74] the world if we don't have the publisher
[553.38 - 558.42] print out the book and pay we don't we
[556.74 - 559.92] have to pay for the paper and print it
[558.42 - 561.48] out to get it out to the world and it
[559.92 - 563.52] can't get into the people's hands for
[561.48 - 565.50] them to heal so there has to be a charge
[563.52 - 567.48] for the book to some degree I can't even
[565.50 - 569.34] believe I'm explaining this
[567.48 - 571.56] when a guy like that says why don't you
[569.34 - 573.60] have everything for free I can't even
[571.56 - 575.16] believe I'm like even saying this right
[573.60 - 577.50] now they have to say this
[575.16 - 579.72] it's crazy
[577.50 - 581.88] it's so you can get it into your hands
[579.72 - 583.80] because someday the the internet may not
[581.88 - 585.66] be there and someday things like that
[583.80 - 588.08] may not be there and you need it in your
[585.66 - 588.08] hands
[588.18 - 592.26] and you you lose electricity then you
[590.40 - 594.48] don't even have ability to find anything
[592.26 - 596.28] online
[594.48 - 597.84] that's how the world works it's
[596.28 - 601.22] important to have

[1443.42 - 1446.90] I spent the life of trying to get the
[1445.46 - 1448.64] information out there and there's always
[1446.90 - 1450.14] going to be somebody that's just not
[1448.64 - 1452.78] gonna understand and they're just gonna
[1450.14 - 1454.82] think it's just a regular old health

[1463.40 - 1466.28] it and there's going to people people
[1464.66 - 1467.90] that are not going to get it I come to
[1466.28 - 1469.94] the realization I was telling my folks

[1469.94 - 1473.60] know what's in these books
[1472.10 - 1474.92] and they're going to understand and
[1473.60 - 1476.42] there's people that are never going to

[1476.42 - 1481.22] going to get the books
[1478.40 - 1483.68] anyway a thought is not intangible it
[1481.22 - 1485.24] runs in electricity read the books to

[1510.98 - 1514.04] another answer to the person's question
[1512.60 - 1516.14] it's like what
[1514.04 - 1519.02] how do these work it's because the brain
[1516.14 - 1521.36] shot is designed to physically give the
[1519.02 - 1524.78] person's brain what it needs to overcome
[1521.36 - 1527.78] that obsessive thought to overcome that

[1548.06 - 1552.62] powerful Lawrence has just ordered your
[1550.82 - 1554.66] book amazing
[1552.62 - 1556.84] incredible TJ says I can't wait to try
[1554.66 - 1556.84] it
[1557.54 - 1562.04] aisling says I tell everybody about you
[1559.76 - 1564.38] I'm honored thank you for being here
[1562.04 - 1567.38] let's go into some stuff we talked about
[1564.38 - 1569.84] the by the way one last thing the brain
[1567.38 - 1572.06] shot therapy challenge is going to be
[1569.84 - 1574.10] next week October 17th
[1572.06 - 1575.60] look out for my email sign up to my
[1574.10 - 1577.46] newsletter so you know when it's coming
[1575.60 - 1579.38] what's going on so let me just say this
[1577.46 - 1581.54] point about all this
[1579.38 - 1583.52] thoughts are not separate from what's
[1581.54 - 1586.34] happening in the brain physically that's
[1583.52 - 1589.28] where everyone gets it wrong if the
[1586.34 - 1591.80] brain doesn't have what it needs and has
[1589.28 - 1593.84] things disrupting the neurons and it's
[1591.80 - 1597.14] in the way of your thoughts
[1593.84 - 1598.40] everything's going to get out of place
[1597.14 - 1599.78] all right let's move on to the
[1598.40 - 1602.54] blood-brain barrier a little bit I'm
[1599.78 - 1604.82] going to put one book up here
[1602.54 - 1606.26] we got some stuff to do let's get
[1604.82 - 1608.78] rolling
[1606.26 - 1610.70] so I'm in this book here
[1608.78 - 1612.50] blood-brain barrier chapter you guys
[1610.70 - 1614.06] with me any of you guys got the book
[1612.50 - 1615.68] right now and you can open it up and
[1614.06 - 1617.06] just go into the blood brain barrier
[1615.68 - 1622.28] chapter have you even looked at that yet
[1617.06 - 1625.40] because whoa and each each page is
[1622.28 - 1630.46] packed just insane blood brain barrier
[1625.40 - 1630.46] page 184 in brain saver
[1630.68 - 1635.24] our human body is not geared for the
[1632.96 - 1636.86] levels of exposure we experience on this
[1635.24 - 1639.56] planet that's something that you have to
[1636.86 - 1642.68] digest and let it resonate our human
[1639.56 - 1645.26] bodies your human body all of our human
[1642.68 - 1647.18] bodies were never Geared for the level
[1645.26 - 1648.44] of exposure that's here on this planet
[1647.18 - 1652.36] right now
[1648.44 - 1652.36] the blood-brain barrier
[1653.06 - 1657.62] the blood-brain barrier never
[1655.04 - 1660.70] anticipated the Industrial Revolution
[1657.62 - 1663.50] and the classified medical industry
[1660.70 - 1665.60] pathogen Revolution
[1663.50 - 1667.52] our blood-brain barrier because I've
[1665.60 - 1669.20] heard people say oh nothing gets through
[1667.52 - 1670.22] the blood-brain barrier it's like oh
[1669.20 - 1672.02] really
[1670.22 - 1673.52] everything gets through the blood brain
[1672.02 - 1676.36] barrier sadly enough
[1673.52 - 1676.36] almost everything
[1676.88 - 1683.18] so the our blood brain barriers never
[1680.30 - 1685.70] anticipated the Industrial Revolution
[1683.18 - 1687.74] were up against or the classified
[1685.70 - 1689.72] medical industry pathogen Revolution
[1687.74 - 1692.84] were up against our blood-brain barrier
[1689.72 - 1695.60] had no idea that was coming ever
[1692.84 - 1697.88] the human blood-brain barrier
[1695.60 - 1699.80] convincing us that we're equipped to
[1697.88 - 1701.60] handle any toxins that come our way is
[1699.80 - 1705.58] like convincing us that our human body
[1701.60 - 1705.58] is equipped to handle nuclear waste
[1706.90 - 1713.84] that's just mind-blowing to me
[1710.54 - 1716.90] we created on the planet so we should be
[1713.84 - 1718.94] fine hey we created nuclear waste on the
[1716.90 - 1720.74] planet so we should be fine our
[1718.94 - 1722.54] blood-brain barrier will handle nuclear
[1720.74 - 1723.68] waste no problem because it was created
[1722.54 - 1725.54] on the planet
[1723.68 - 1728.24] sure blood brain barrier can handle
[1725.54 - 1730.34] everything it will be good
[1728.24 - 1732.02] everything bad that's created on this
[1730.34 - 1735.16] planet will be fine because it was
[1732.02 - 1735.16] created on this planet
[1738.52 - 1742.88] our blood-brain barrier should have no
[1741.20 - 1746.86] problem protecting us against nuclear
[1742.88 - 1746.86] waste or any other toxic material right
[1747.38 - 1750.74] or blood-brain barrier is incredible it
[1749.06 - 1753.10] could stop anything it could stop
[1750.74 - 1753.10] anything
[1753.38 - 1757.16] if you guys just came on here reading
[1755.60 - 1759.14] through the brain saver books forty
[1757.16 - 1764.42] percent off Amazon
[1759.14 - 1766.34] dot com us right now 40 off take a look
[1764.42 - 1768.38] make sure you get a couple of these
[1766.34 - 1771.52] because it's a set
[1768.38 - 1771.52] books are huge
[1771.98 - 1776.48] get ready for this no one is measuring
[1774.26 - 1778.28] the levels of toxins are in our
[1776.48 - 1780.08] environment in relation to how our
[1778.28 - 1782.66] bodies handle and receive them no one's
[1780.08 - 1785.54] measuring toxins are in our environment
[1782.66 - 1787.64] you could be driving down the road and
[1785.54 - 1790.40] there could be a town or city truck
[1787.64 - 1792.92] spraying
[1790.40 - 1795.50] some dangerous herbicides like they do
[1792.92 - 1797.18] on the side of the roads and you can
[1795.50 - 1799.40] just have your child sitting in the
[1797.18 - 1801.02] passenger seat with your window down and
[1799.40 - 1802.40] literally just take it all in that
[1801.02 - 1804.08] herbicide right when you're driving down
[1802.40 - 1806.24] the road no one's measuring anything
[1804.08 - 1808.46] anywhere
[1806.24 - 1811.28] mosquito sprays being dropped all over
[1808.46 - 1813.80] this planet on Everybody by helicopters
[1811.28 - 1816.02] no one's measuring that
[1813.80 - 1818.84] Kaelyn says can we do brain shots on the
[1816.02 - 1821.12] 369s yes you can you can bring in the
[1818.84 - 1822.74] brain shots while you're doing the 369s
[1821.12 - 1824.90] you don't have to stop your medical
[1822.74 - 1827.48] medium protocols to do the brain shots
[1824.90 - 1829.16] really good question Caitlin thank you
[1827.48 - 1833.06] for that because I forgot to tell
[1829.16 - 1835.16] everybody that my bad my bad my bad my
[1833.06 - 1837.68] bad
[1835.16 - 1839.36] you can keep your 28 day cleanses you
[1837.68 - 1840.80] can keep which is medical medium you can
[1839.36 - 1843.08] keep your medical medium heavy metal
[1840.80 - 1845.48] detoxes you can keep whatever you want
[1843.08 - 1847.94] you can keep your medical medium three
[1845.48 - 1851.90] six nines advanced
[1847.94 - 1854.00] you can keep your medical medium
[1851.90 - 1856.34] right all your medical medium your
[1854.00 - 1858.38] monocleanse your morning cleanse
[1856.34 - 1860.60] you can keep those too you can be on a
[1858.38 - 1864.50] medical media monocleanse
[1860.60 - 1868.12] and still do your shots
[1864.50 - 1868.12] I'm a brain shot therapy
[1871.70 - 1876.08] medical Industries don't want to admit
[1874.58 - 1878.18] there are toxic heavy metals in our
[1876.08 - 1879.56] brain did you know that they don't the
[1878.18 - 1881.00] industries don't want you to know you've
[1879.56 - 1883.28] got toxic heavy metals in the brain they
[1881.00 - 1885.14] don't even want to entertain the idea
[1883.28 - 1887.36] never mind that we're living with
[1885.14 - 1890.06] inflammation in our brain from pathogens
[1887.36 - 1891.26] everybody is publicly known medical
[1890.06 - 1892.40] research and sense so what you're going
[1891.26 - 1893.72] to learn something in the medical mean
[1892.40 - 1896.60] books that's going to be mind-blowing
[1893.72 - 1900.16] this alone in the mm books the brain
[1896.60 - 1900.16] saver books is going to blow your mind
[1901.00 - 1905.66] there's something called publicly known
[1903.86 - 1907.28] medical research in science and the
[1905.66 - 1909.38] classified medical research and science
[1907.28 - 1911.00] these are the only books out here in
[1909.38 - 1912.74] history that are actually distinguished
[1911.00 - 1914.72] distinguishing distinguishing
[1912.74 - 1916.46] distinguishing that's it the difference
[1914.72 - 1917.90] not a lot of words going through my
[1916.46 - 1918.68] brain right now to get this out to you
[1917.90 - 1920.30] guys
[1918.68 - 1923.48] so you need to know that there actually
[1920.30 - 1926.78] is a difference there's two systems
[1923.48 - 1929.72] built these books describe and detail
[1926.78 - 1933.50] what that all is
[1929.72 - 1936.26] which is incredible all on its own
[1933.50 - 1939.40] hell yeah on day nine good cool you're
[1936.26 - 1939.40] on day nine absolutely
[1939.86 - 1944.12] so check this out
[1942.14 - 1946.34] these books are the only books in
[1944.12 - 1948.32] history so far out there that are going
[1946.34 - 1949.58] to talk to you about the truth and tell
[1948.32 - 1951.14] you about the classified medical
[1949.58 - 1954.20] research and Science and the publicly
[1951.14 - 1956.78] known uh medical research and science
[1954.20 - 1959.36] and what the differences are
[1956.78 - 1962.72] by the way brain shots are in day
[1959.36 - 1966.10] brain shots can be yes used on day nine
[1962.72 - 1966.10] of the 369 that's okay
[1967.04 - 1972.08] I'm hearing information from SOC I'm
[1969.68 - 1974.90] trying to read the books I'm trying to
[1972.08 - 1977.42] I'm trying to answer questions
[1974.90 - 1979.04] I'm getting readings from Spirit of
[1977.42 - 1980.36] compassion on a bunch of you guys
[1979.04 - 1982.16] because it happens automatically and
[1980.36 - 1984.08] there's nothing I can do about it
[1982.16 - 1985.82] at the same time getting information
[1984.08 - 1987.44] from Spirit of compassion at the same
[1985.82 - 1990.70] time trying to read the book at the same
[1987.44 - 1990.70] time trying to express everything
[1992.12 - 1996.08] I might bring some
[1994.16 - 1998.42] balls out and I could juggle them too
[1996.08 - 2000.84] maybe while we're doing all that I could
[1998.42 - 2000.84] try that
[2001.36 - 2004.62] I do had a shovel
[2004.72 - 2008.92] had no time to practice
[2007.12 - 2010.54] medical Industries don't want us to
[2008.92 - 2012.04] admit there's toxic heavy metals in our
[2010.54 - 2013.78] brain they don't even want to entertain
[2012.04 - 2016.24] the idea never mind that we're living
[2013.78 - 2018.40] with inflammation publicly known medical
[2016.24 - 2020.74] research in science are in the infancy
[2018.40 - 2024.52] stages of recognizing a chronic illness
[2020.74 - 2026.56] dude dude
[2024.52 - 2028.84] publicly known medical research and
[2026.56 - 2031.24] science are at their baby stages just
[2028.84 - 2032.98] recognizing chronic illness could be
[2031.24 - 2035.56] pathogen related
[2032.98 - 2037.06] if they're that early in the process of
[2035.56 - 2038.74] understanding chronic illness how
[2037.06 - 2040.78] advanced can they be in understanding
[2038.74 - 2042.88] our body's complex mechanisms like the
[2040.78 - 2045.22] blood-brain barrier you mean to tell me
[2042.88 - 2047.02] it was just a couple of years ago before
[2045.22 - 2048.72] medical research and science started
[2047.02 - 2051.34] adopting medical medium information
[2048.72 - 2052.96] about pathogens and all that it was just
[2051.34 - 2055.54] a couple of years ago they don't even
[2052.96 - 2057.88] know how the blood-brain barrier works
[2055.54 - 2059.56] a lot of you have questions about timing
[2057.88 - 2062.26] of brain shots the questions are
[2059.56 - 2064.18] answered in the brain saver books so you
[2062.26 - 2066.88] guys if you have timing questions all
[2064.18 - 2069.40] about the brain shot Therapies
[2066.88 - 2070.42] they're in the books the information's
[2069.40 - 2072.70] in there
[2070.42 - 2074.74] totally I didn't leave that out I made
[2072.70 - 2077.40] sure that these books were jacked up
[2074.74 - 2077.40] with that information
[2078.58 - 2083.02] our blood-brain barrier was not made for
[2081.16 - 2085.12] any of this we act like it's an
[2083.02 - 2088.42] impermanable structure that has no
[2085.12 - 2090.94] limitations what you'll find in
[2088.42 - 2093.76] alternative medicine if anybody even
[2090.94 - 2097.60] utters or spits out the word blood brain
[2093.76 - 2100.42] barrier it's as if it's an impermanable
[2097.60 - 2102.90] force on its own and nothing can pass
[2100.42 - 2102.90] through it
[2104.80 - 2108.88] we act like it's an impermanable
[2106.78 - 2111.16] structure that has no limitations
[2108.88 - 2112.96] nuclear waste anybody
[2111.16 - 2115.30] Dr Sherry green unfortunately Medical
[2112.96 - 2118.36] Science has messed up in many ways that
[2115.30 - 2120.16] comes out every day now absolutely not
[2118.36 - 2121.48] only that here's how it works and I talk
[2120.16 - 2124.12] about it in the brain saver books you
[2121.48 - 2125.92] get sick okay here's what it is
[2124.12 - 2129.46] you're born
[2125.92 - 2132.40] you're here you're a baby
[2129.46 - 2134.62] you grow up
[2132.40 - 2137.20] and you're taught that
[2134.62 - 2139.90] science has it all sewed up you go to
[2137.20 - 2144.06] school science knows everything you go
[2139.90 - 2144.06] to university science knows everything
[2144.10 - 2149.80] and then someday you get sick
[2148.18 - 2151.54] and then you think science knows
[2149.80 - 2152.98] everything I'll be fixed tomorrow I'm
[2151.54 - 2155.62] sick now with all these crazy symptoms
[2152.98 - 2157.06] I'm just gonna go to a doctor my mom and
[2155.62 - 2158.80] dad are going to take me to a doctor and
[2157.06 - 2160.96] I'll be all fixed tomorrow and then
[2158.80 - 2164.56] you'll realize uh what
[2160.96 - 2166.24] uh autoimmune uh what this that I'm not
[2164.56 - 2168.70] being fixed what pills do you want me to
[2166.24 - 2169.90] take Mom Dad what did the doctor say so
[2168.70 - 2171.22] then you're coming out you're like a
[2169.90 - 2172.54] college student now you're learning if
[2171.22 - 2175.24] you're sick as a college student you're
[2172.54 - 2177.52] learning uh I thought science knew
[2175.24 - 2179.98] everything and then you go into your 20s
[2177.52 - 2181.72] and you're like I'm so sick I can't work
[2179.98 - 2183.94] now or I can't function and then you
[2181.72 - 2185.86] learn that science let you down and now
[2183.94 - 2188.44] you're like 27 years old and you're sick
[2185.86 - 2189.94] and you're like what was I sold all
[2188.44 - 2191.98] these years that science and research
[2189.94 - 2194.80] knew everything I've been to 20 doctors
[2191.98 - 2196.72] I'm 27 years old I've taken 20
[2194.80 - 2198.28] medications I've been to 20 functional
[2196.72 - 2201.66] medicine doctors
[2198.28 - 2201.66] and I'm still sick
[2203.44 - 2207.94] everybody thinks just Industrial Waste
[2206.08 - 2209.50] and solvents and toxic heavy metals
[2207.94 - 2211.66] don't exist in our body but they cross
[2209.50 - 2213.52] the blood-brain barrier I learned that
[2211.66 - 2216.06] nothing could cross the blood-brain
[2213.52 - 2218.26] barrier either in school health with Liz
[2216.06 - 2220.90] oh my God
[2218.26 - 2223.18] it's in Oh My God moment like oh my God
[2220.90 - 2224.74] exactly
[2223.18 - 2226.66] you know this is a moment where like
[2224.74 - 2228.34] this bumblebees lying around and it's
[2226.66 - 2230.02] alone and it finds another bumblebee
[2228.34 - 2231.82] that and it's like another bumblebee
[2230.02 - 2234.76] right butterflies flying around and
[2231.82 - 2237.46] butterfly finds another butterfly
[2234.76 - 2238.90] we always get all the validation from
[2237.46 - 2240.76] you
[2238.90 - 2243.76] Health with Liz I just want to say this
[2240.76 - 2246.04] okay that wait uh
[2243.76 - 2248.14] Amanda says this means we don't need to
[2246.04 - 2250.12] blame ourselves for our own depression
[2248.14 - 2251.62] or anxiety that's the whole point too
[2250.12 - 2253.72] because everybody's blamed on it
[2251.62 - 2255.82] everybody's blamed on it health local is
[2253.72 - 2257.44] you're right you were taught that
[2255.82 - 2258.52] nothing can get through the blood-brain
[2257.44 - 2260.26] barrier
[2258.52 - 2261.82] everybody's taught right that nothing
[2260.26 - 2264.04] gets through the blood brain barrier but
[2261.82 - 2265.84] they're wrong
[2264.04 - 2267.34] I talk about what gets through the
[2265.84 - 2268.54] blood-brain barrier these books are
[2267.34 - 2271.42] incredible
[2268.54 - 2275.02] wondering Wishin says the dream shot
[2271.42 - 2277.42] tastes amazing the dream shot which I
[2275.02 - 2279.70] personally love
[2277.42 - 2281.86] I take the dream shot
[2279.70 - 2284.26] I take the dream shot before I go to bed
[2281.86 - 2286.12] I take the dream shot a little bit
[2284.26 - 2287.50] earlier than that too I take it twice
[2286.12 - 2289.24] actually so a lot of times I'll take a
[2287.50 - 2291.16] dream shot at like
[2289.24 - 2292.96] 10 o'clock at night then I'll take the
[2291.16 - 2294.70] dream shot like two in the morning
[2292.96 - 2297.16] before I go to bed
[2294.70 - 2300.16] why am I up till two I'm working
[2297.16 - 2302.92] wake up at six then I get my four hours
[2300.16 - 2305.10] of sleep depending that's a good day
[2302.92 - 2305.10] foreign
[2305.50 - 2308.98] all right
[2307.12 - 2311.62] enough about me it's not the Anthony
[2308.98 - 2316.36] Williams Show it never was
[2311.62 - 2318.52] about answers and about our suffering
[2316.36 - 2320.44] all someone has to do is use the term
[2318.52 - 2321.58] blood-brain barrier to make us feel like
[2320.44 - 2323.20] we're protected it's like you're
[2321.58 - 2325.12] protected you've got your blood brain
[2323.20 - 2327.64] barrier
[2325.12 - 2330.16] and yet the reality is that all these
[2327.64 - 2332.38] and more inevitably cross meaning toxins
[2330.16 - 2334.66] you guys cross our blood-brain barrier
[2332.38 - 2336.40] many Pharmaceuticals are specifically
[2334.66 - 2338.26] engineered to cross our blood-brain
[2336.40 - 2339.88] barrier even the Pharmaceuticals show
[2338.26 - 2341.62] this is mind-blowing right here nobody
[2339.88 - 2344.26] knows any of this it doesn't matter what
[2341.62 - 2347.08] podcast doctor talks or whoever no one
[2344.26 - 2350.26] knows any of this look at this even the
[2347.08 - 2352.12] Pharmaceuticals not designed
[2350.26 - 2354.34] with it in mind to cross your
[2352.12 - 2356.20] blood-brain barrier
[2354.34 - 2357.94] cross your blood brain barrier
[2356.20 - 2359.68] interesting so you can be taking
[2357.94 - 2361.00] Pharmaceuticals and they're not designed
[2359.68 - 2364.06] across the blood-brain barrier but they
[2361.00 - 2366.22] cross the blood-brain barrier
[2364.06 - 2368.14] what is the dream shot are our animal

[2713.74 - 2716.94] my apologies

[2724.66 - 2728.44] of the brain
[2726.04 - 2731.94] that's all it was designed for was it

[2772.72 - 2778.14] including Advanced cleanse in the
[2774.70 - 2778.14] medical medium brain saver books
[2779.02 - 2783.94] when someone has a little too much uric
[2782.02 - 2787.36] acid
[2783.94 - 2788.62] build up because a kidney is weakened a
[2787.36 - 2790.84] lot of people have weakened kidneys
[2788.62 - 2792.88] without knowing it for instance that
[2790.84 - 2795.22] uric acid is not supposed to permeate
[2792.88 - 2797.80] the blood-brain barrier
[2795.22 - 2799.72] if someone gets a cut that goes deep and
[2797.80 - 2801.52] leads to a skin infection then that
[2799.72 - 2804.34] person could develop the beginning
[2801.52 - 2806.20] stages of sepsis in which case the blood
[2804.34 - 2807.82] infection is not supposed to cross the
[2806.20 - 2809.98] blood-brain barrier the blood-brain
[2807.82 - 2812.02] barrier is for when you get a cut and
[2809.98 - 2813.88] you get some kind of sepsis or infection
[2812.02 - 2815.74] the blood-brain barrier is when you got
[2813.88 - 2817.66] too much uric acid building up in your
[2815.74 - 2820.06] kidneys and system because you have a
[2817.66 - 2822.28] weak kidney the blood-brain barrier is
[2820.06 - 2824.50] for normal bodily toxins like normal
[2822.28 - 2826.90] ammonia amounts of ammonia in your body
[2824.50 - 2828.76] certain things that are inside the body
[2826.90 - 2830.38] the blood-brain barrier tries to stop a
[2828.76 - 2832.12] lot of the sin doesn't stop all of it
[2830.38 - 2833.86] but there's the natural stuff that
[2832.12 - 2835.36] occurs inside our body the blood-brain
[2833.86 - 2836.62] barrier is trying to stop but the
[2835.36 - 2839.28] blood-brain barrier doesn't stop
[2836.62 - 2839.28] anything else
[2840.76 - 2846.04] if someone ingests a toxic plant that's
[2844.06 - 2848.20] been on planet Earth for 10 000 years
[2846.04 - 2849.64] and was never meant to be human food the
[2848.20 - 2851.44] blood-brain barrier is there to hold
[2849.64 - 2852.52] back at least some of those poisons who
[2851.44 - 2855.22] knows that
[2852.52 - 2856.78] who knows that

[2934.54 - 2937.54] never meant to be human food the
[2936.16 - 2939.40] blood-brain barrier is there to hold
[2937.54 - 2941.50] back at least some of the toxins in an
[2939.40 - 2944.14] effort to prevent the brain from going
[2941.50 - 2946.18] into toxic shock no one on this planet
[2944.14 - 2949.12] knows that
[2946.18 - 2952.74] and you can't make up this stuff
[2949.12 - 2956.14] can't make up almost 1300 pages of
[2952.74 - 2957.70] literally scripture from above
[2956.14 - 2959.92] that becomes Advanced Medical
[2957.70 - 2962.50] information that science research ends
[2959.92 - 2966.00] up stealing down the road and proving it
[2962.50 - 2966.00] right but never proving it wrong
[2966.70 - 2973.60] our blood cerebral fluid
[2970.24 - 2975.64] barrier is also over taxed cerebral
[2973.60 - 2977.68] spinal fluid which surrounds the brain
[2975.64 - 2979.90] and spinal cord is supposed to be pure
[2977.68 - 2982.42] with no contamination that's the gold
[2979.90 - 2984.16] standard that's the gold standard in
[2982.42 - 2987.22] this time on planet Earth our cerebral
[2984.16 - 2988.96] spinal fluid is not pure so our spinal
[2987.22 - 2992.14] fluid's not pure
[2988.96 - 2995.34] okay all of us got dirty spinal fluid if
[2992.14 - 2995.34] we're getting exposures

[3003.30 - 3005.94] let's keep on going a little bit more
[3004.68 - 3007.56] about that was pretty cool that's the

[3007.56 - 3009.86] Earth
[3009.90 - 3014.76] our spinal fluid is not pure it's
[3012.00 - 3017.10] harboring chemical soups from Industries
[3014.76 - 3020.28] pathogenic byproducts toxic heavy metals
[3017.10 - 3023.64] and more a thousand years ago cerebral
[3020.28 - 3025.62] spinal fluid May simply have had some
[3023.64 - 3027.90] toxic heavy metal contamination but
[3025.62 - 3029.88] that's about it for the people living in
[3027.90 - 3031.92] cities drinking lead water back during
[3029.88 - 3033.66] the Roman days

[3762.12 - 3765.42] manage to remain considering how
[3763.68 - 3766.74] inflammatory a lot of these issues can
[3765.42 - 3768.96] be
[3766.74 - 3771.72] Rhonda
[3768.96 - 3774.12] I stay as neutral as I can but the
[3771.72 - 3776.16] haters are big
[3774.12 - 3777.84] the amount of crap talk out there on
[3776.16 - 3779.52] social media about me is unbelievable
[3777.84 - 3781.14] behind the scenes and in front of the
[3779.52 - 3784.02] scenes
[3781.14 - 3786.12] people try to tear down the mm left and
[3784.02 - 3787.92] right I got the kick me sign on my back
[3786.12 - 3790.86] my butt's been kicked so hard so many
[3787.92 - 3792.90] times it's sore Lynette says are you a
[3790.86 - 3794.94] Christian I'm wondering since you say
[3792.90 - 3796.86] the info comes from above I know you say
[3794.94 - 3799.20] from SOC but I struggle to understand
[3796.86 - 3802.02] this as a Christian
[3799.20 - 3805.20] I really do like a majority of your info
[3802.02 - 3806.88] and have four of your books as listen I
[3805.20 - 3810.06] will say this okay
[3806.88 - 3811.86] that you being here means the world to
[3810.06 - 3813.90] me okay because I know that some
[3811.86 - 3816.32] Christians they'll be like he's the
[3813.90 - 3816.32] devil
[3816.84 - 3821.76] it's like okay well
[3818.58 - 3823.14] a lifetime of work getting people out of
[3821.76 - 3824.82] wheelchairs
[3823.14 - 3826.86] saving lives
[3824.82 - 3828.24] bringing information to people so they
[3826.86 - 3831.84] can heal
[3828.24 - 3834.98] and then choose whatever religion they
[3831.84 - 3834.98] want to choose in their life
[3835.26 - 3841.88] it's not easy to partake in a religion
[3838.80 - 3845.46] or religious belief system or anything
[3841.88 - 3847.62] if you're so sick
[3845.46 - 3851.76] or not here
[3847.62 - 3853.62] my job is to make sure that everybody
[3851.76 - 3855.72] gets healthy
[3853.62 - 3858.60] heals
[3855.72 - 3862.02] get strong and they can believe in
[3858.60 - 3865.64] anything they want to believe in
[3862.02 - 3865.64] what I've always told Christians
[3865.74 - 3869.70] is
[3867.12 - 3872.46] what about profits out there
[3869.70 - 3874.08] Christians believe in Prophets
[3872.46 - 3875.64] I do know that
[3874.08 - 3877.20] that's something that Christians believe
[3875.64 - 3880.08] in
[3877.20 - 3883.62] and if you look into the medical medium
[3880.08 - 3887.06] books you'll find there is
[3883.62 - 3887.06] a message always
[3887.10 - 3892.14] from the scripture down here so you can
[3890.52 - 3895.32] look and find it
[3892.14 - 3897.96] I'm going to do a show
[3895.32 - 3899.64] about Christianity at some point in the
[3897.96 - 3901.32] medical meeting podcast I just haven't
[3899.64 - 3903.54] had the chance I have all eight of your
[3901.32 - 3905.82] books I love them
[3903.54 - 3909.38] amazing
[3905.82 - 3909.38] William Miller it's Bryce
[3911.16 - 3915.78] Cold Light spring says it seems prophets
[3913.20 - 3917.58] only existed in biblical times
[3915.78 - 3920.04] but I can't see the rest of the comment
[3917.58 - 3922.98] oh there it is which is kind of weird
[3920.04 - 3925.44] Trisha Marie with a Christian background
[3922.98 - 3928.40] all of this makes complete and perfect
[3925.44 - 3928.40] sense to me
[3930.18 - 3933.72] I think a lot of Christians use medical
[3932.10 - 3935.34] meme information
[3933.72 - 3937.14] I really do
[3935.34 - 3939.54] I know there's some that just they can't
[3937.14 - 3941.52] get around they can't get around it and
[3939.54 - 3943.08] they're like I just can't look at those
[3941.52 - 3944.94] books or something and I still have
[3943.08 - 3947.18] respect for everybody in them it's all
[3944.94 - 3947.18] good

[4035.54 - 4040.10] Williams circus show and I go on all
[4038.12 - 4042.26] that stuff you guys and spend all this

[4046.52 - 4053.26] won't be in your hands
[4048.92 - 4053.26] so I I do very little out there
[4055.40 - 4059.24] Melissa Davis as a Christian I have no
[4057.74 - 4061.28] trouble believing that Spirit would
[4059.24 - 4062.84] choose a strong person to relay an
[4061.28 - 4065.54] important message
[4062.84 - 4067.22] and hijacked his entire life I will tell
[4065.54 - 4069.80] you that that's exactly factual
[4067.22 - 4073.10] everything you just said about me is
[4069.80 - 4076.70] that yes my life was hijacked
[4073.10 - 4081.26] am I strong don't know
[4076.70 - 4083.78] when I was on the when I was on um
[4081.26 - 4085.58] Oliver and Kate Hudson's podcast I
[4083.78 - 4086.96] talked about a little bit about that and
[4085.58 - 4089.48] Oliver
[4086.96 - 4093.40] Ollie said you know like there it is
[4089.48 - 4093.40] there it is that's why you were picked
[4094.16 - 4096.76] anyway
[4097.04 - 4100.70] Lorraine house is grateful for your
[4098.72 - 4104.38] office chair
[4100.70 - 4104.38] maybe someday it'll be in a museum
[4104.84 - 4108.26] anyway you guys
[4107.00 - 4110.24] um the point is this I didn't want to
[4108.26 - 4111.98] make it the Anthony Williams Show out
[4110.24 - 4113.78] there and I can go and do all that stuff
[4111.98 - 4115.46] I can fill my entire schedule I just
[4113.78 - 4117.32] want to say this I can fill my entire
[4115.46 - 4122.42] schedule
[4117.32 - 4124.64] with TV appearances podcast appearances
[4122.42 - 4128.24] TV series
[4124.64 - 4131.66] all of it I can hop on a plane and fly
[4128.24 - 4134.00] around everywhere and be in every Studio
[4131.66 - 4135.62] to Kingdom Come
[4134.00 - 4138.02] I can
[4135.62 - 4139.88] and I can do that for years and talk
[4138.02 - 4141.80] about how I hear Spirit of compassion
[4139.88 - 4143.84] and talk about all of that but I'm going
[4141.80 - 4145.76] to make it the Anthony Williams Show and
[4143.84 - 4148.82] then these things will never be produced
[4145.76 - 4150.80] ever all these things won't be produced
[4148.82 - 4153.56] they just won't be made they won't be
[4150.80 - 4155.72] produced it won't be possible it just
[4153.56 - 4158.36] won't happen
[4155.72 - 4160.10] it just won't happen because this is the
[4158.36 - 4162.44] scripture right here and my job is to
[4160.10 - 4164.36] make sure I do this and try not to do so
[4162.44 - 4166.22] many appearances anywhere once in a
[4164.36 - 4169.12] while I'll break and do something I'd be
[4166.22 - 4169.12] like all right I'll do it
[4169.16 - 4176.24] let's cleanse the heel by the way
[4172.76 - 4178.34] you know I look at this book and I say
[4176.24 - 4180.50] thank you for turning so many lives
[4178.34 - 4183.26] around healing so many people and saving
[4180.50 - 4185.54] so many lives thank you because you've
[4183.26 - 4188.66] saved so many lives I say that to that
[4185.54 - 4191.12] book right there and I sit at my office
[4188.66 - 4192.92] desk and I say thank you for saving
[4191.12 - 4195.92] millions of lives around the planet to
[4192.92 - 4197.72] you too because without you so many
[4195.92 - 4199.88] people would have not gotten off of
[4197.72 - 4202.40] mattress Island I say thank you thank
[4199.88 - 4204.82] you thank you and I do I'm grateful
[4202.40 - 4204.82] that's why
[4205.22 - 4210.38] and then I'll say the soc thank you to
[4207.76 - 4212.96] even though you've hijacked my life and
[4210.38 - 4215.42] made my life very hard
[4212.96 - 4218.18] it makes sense all of it builds up
[4215.42 - 4219.26] builds a pond and doesn't contradict so
[4218.18 - 4221.42] that's the whole thing all the medical
[4219.26 - 4223.10] meaning books build and build upon each
[4221.42 - 4226.34] other with the new information coming in
[4223.10 - 4228.62] but never contradict
[4226.34 - 4229.76] medical me I just I just want to say
[4228.62 - 4232.64] this last thing I've said it before
[4229.76 - 4235.28] ready medical medium information is not
[4232.64 - 4237.68] common sense
[4235.28 - 4240.38] because none of the medical medium
[4237.68 - 4242.42] information was ever common
[4240.38 - 4245.90] originally
[4242.42 - 4247.82] it was unique original and brand new and
[4245.90 - 4249.98] then as it got out there and the
[4247.82 - 4252.56] millions of people partooking it and and
[4249.98 - 4254.42] spread that information around much of
[4252.56 - 4256.88] it became common
[4254.42 - 4258.56] meaning like common knowledge but
[4256.88 - 4261.26] medical meme information just makes
[4258.56 - 4263.66] sense it's not common sense
[4261.26 - 4266.00] by the way clean your books if you guys
[4263.66 - 4269.12] want if you get a dirty book
[4266.00 - 4271.88] from Amazon or somewhere because their
[4269.12 - 4273.98] conveyor belt got greasy
[4271.88 - 4275.90] because their conveyor belt got greasy
[4273.98 - 4278.54] put a little dish soap
[4275.90 - 4280.10] damp cloth not too wet you don't want to
[4278.54 - 4282.98] soak your book because then you're gonna
[4280.10 - 4285.32] have a wet book and you clean off your
[4282.98 - 4289.10] covers you they're all brand new when
[4285.32 - 4291.86] they leave the publishers
[4289.10 - 4294.74] right the printer and they leave the
[4291.86 - 4296.78] publisher they're pristine
[4294.74 - 4299.66] no odor
[4296.78 - 4302.00] no air fresheners no scented candles no
[4299.66 - 4304.94] perfumes no colognes no no whatever
[4302.00 - 4307.76] they're pristine and what happens is
[4304.94 - 4309.74] they go into like the Amazon places and
[4307.76 - 4311.90] what happens is the conveyor belts are
[4309.74 - 4313.40] greasy they're all filled with grease
[4311.90 - 4314.78] because they have to grease The Wheels
[4313.40 - 4316.34] on the conveyors
[4314.78 - 4318.14] and then
[4316.34 - 4319.46] the books get thrown on the conveyor
[4318.14 - 4320.66] belt and you might get some grease you
[4319.46 - 4322.64] have to clean it off they'll come out
[4320.66 - 4325.52] beautiful you guys leave some reviews if
[4322.64 - 4328.04] you can I hate asking for reviews
[4325.52 - 4330.86] but it keeps the trolls like from
[4328.04 - 4332.54] getting ahead ones that did not purchase
[4330.86 - 4335.24] the books the ones that never read the
[4332.54 - 4337.76] books the ones that just don't like
[4335.24 - 4339.50] medical medium because they don't like
[4337.76 - 4341.48] my face they don't like my voice they
[4339.50 - 4343.82] don't like what I'm doing whatever and
[4341.48 - 4345.38] look out for imposters yeah if you can
[4343.82 - 4347.06] if you can leave a review that would be
[4345.38 - 4349.04] incredible because it helps other people
[4347.06 - 4351.80] find it and then say oh my God this
[4349.04 - 4355.12] person said this that I I'm gonna take a
[4351.80 - 4355.12] look I'm gonna take a chance
[4356.12 - 4360.56] and look out for imposters
[4358.82 - 4361.76] there's some imposters saying some
[4360.56 - 4363.08] terrible things and doing terrible
[4361.76 - 4365.66] things to people they say they're
[4363.08 - 4367.76] Anthony William or Williams
[4365.66 - 4369.68] they pretend they're the medical medium
[4367.76 - 4371.48] and then they offer consultations I
[4369.68 - 4373.40] don't do consultations
[4371.48 - 4375.38] and they offer consultations and then
[4373.40 - 4377.72] they say terrible things and do terrible
[4375.38 - 4382.12] things to people
[4377.72 - 4382.12] and so please look out for imposters
[4383.72 - 4387.20] this is the official Anthony Williams
