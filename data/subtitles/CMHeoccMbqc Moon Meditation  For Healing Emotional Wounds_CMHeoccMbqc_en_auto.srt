159
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,000
spreading the word for medical medium

160
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,479
information helping people heal you have

161
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,840
tremendous compassion and your

162
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:14,720
information is always

163
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,199
just spot on just uh i'm honored that

164
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,000
you're here

165
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:20,400
truly honored that you're here um kathy

166
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,160
says what is the lemonade stand meaning

167
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,840
the lemonade stand and the brain

168
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,440
meditation so let's talk about some of

169
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:28,160
the meanings inside

170
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,520
inside this okay and what happens is

171
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,919
that

172
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,960
there's uh our neurons get tattered

173
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,520
along the way

174
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,080
so when we go through hardships losses

175
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,240
and we

176
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,759
end up getting fear as their soul gets

177
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,680
kicked out of her body so

178
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,600
when we have a hardship when we have a

179
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,639
loss we can get the

180
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,560
depression depersonalization we can

181
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:49,840
actually have an out-of-body experience

182
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,199
every time we go through something

183
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,880
whether it's a broken relationship

184
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,440
whether it's anything a

185
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:57,199
hardship and so our soul leaves our our

186
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,080
body for a little bit and then fear

187
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,240
fills in the gap

188
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,080
and when this happens when we get told

189
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,199
bad news or we go through something hard

190
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,840
or something emotionally

191
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:07,600
trouble troublesome neurons get

192
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,960
overheated in the emotional center of

193
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,600
the brain so neurons get

194
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,160
overheated they just fry you know burn

195
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,919
out

196
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,160
so we get burnout like something too

197
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,960
emotional that wasn't that wasn't fair

198
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,440
or something

199
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,600
we got some we were misunderstood or

200
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,919
betrayal or we got stabbed in the back

201
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,160
and

202
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:25,840
all of a sudden you get this burnout

203
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,240
occur in the in the emotional center of

204
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,960
the brain well that burnout

205
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,800
um get those neurons get tattered but

206
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,600
they don't have an opportunity to really

207
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:38,000
heal so easy and our soul gets distant

208
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,000
from our body because of this because of

209
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,120
what we go through in the struggles and

210
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,160
the lemonade stand and the the family

211
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,440
that's fishing

212
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:51,120
on the bridge and the golden retriever

213
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:54,319
that's coming to you are all

214
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:56,880
zoned they're safety zones the neurons

215
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,720
see them as safety zones and when the

216
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,400
neurons see them as safety zones you're

217
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,199
repairing neurons and repairing the

218
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,759
bridge

219
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,720

apple podcast it's uncensored

uncensored there so people can heal uh

339
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:09,600
for sure um did you catch episode four

340
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,760
the air freshener episode air freshener

341
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,440
sent to candles

342
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,000
because air fresheners and scented

343
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,880
candles can irritate our central nervous

344
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,720
system

345
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:21,279
and it can bring on a little bit of

346
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,279
anxiety bring on a little bit of

347
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,640
some migraines it can bring on a little

348
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:27,120
bit of depression

349
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,240
it can bring on especially anxiety and

350
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,920
migraines so

351
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,079
you want to pull those air fresheners

352
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:34,000
out of the wall and boop throw them out

353
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:36,160
you want to you want to not do that

354
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,600
stuff you sent the candles

355
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,200
don't light them you can keep them there

356
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,040
but don't light them i would i would

357
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,200
remove them and i would get candles that

358
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,839
actually aren't scented by chemicals and

359
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,640
all that

360
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:48,320
because these chemicals really get into

361
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,720
our lungs they get into our body they

362
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,560
cause

363
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,639
problems they create more anxiety

364
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:55,360
sensitive nerves they can make us sick

365
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:57,440
so it's really a great powerful episode

366
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,519
said the candles colognes perfumes

367
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,040
the episode is called killing you smelly

368
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,240
it's air fresheners scented candles

369
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,399
cologne's perfumes

370
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,320

371
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,279

372
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,800

504
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:13,920
piece is missing and all that stuff so

505
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:15,600
very important to know um i you know the

506
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,320
thing is about the brain meditation when

507
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,360
you're ridding

508
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:21,600
fear from your from soul your soul when

509
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,360
you're reading fear from your body

510
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,040
and your soul comes together in that

511
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,399
connection that bridge

512
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,800
gaps like that all of a sudden it

513
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:30,399
connects and the gap disappears and your

514
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,839
soul starts to connect with the neurons

515
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,639
in your brain and your physical brain

516
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:34,480
and body

517
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,160
it's an experience unlike any other so

518
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,880
the brain meditation is that one there

519
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:40,320
too

520
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:42,160
um i've always have had meditation so a

521
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,639
medical medium book i put meditations in

522
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,480
there

523
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:46,160
i've done lectures with meditations i've

524
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,759
done meditations and all kinds of

525
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,680
different

526
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,519
workshops i've done medical media

527
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,519
meditations from above so i want to

528
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:55,839
tell you guys about this part is that

529
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,360
but this i'm making sure i do guided

530
00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:00,880
ones in a podcast

531
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:02,560
uncensored for you guys powerful ones

532
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:05,039
barbara says the fruit fear episode was

533
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:08,160
great uh hey trisha

534
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:10,799
trisha marie's here tonight yay um

535
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,480
so yeah it's the thing is i finally not

536
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:13,839
feeling okay so sandy says i'm finally

537
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,439
not feeling disconnected

538
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:17,520
like i've had for the last three years

539
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,160
the brain meditation is great i finally

540
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,559
feel like

541
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,400
mixing with people that's incredible

542
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:24,799
because once you rid the fear

543
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,959
out of the physical body and the soul

544
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:29,200
healing happens and the moon meditation

545
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,880
pulls the poison out of us too it's so

546
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,000
powerful what happens in that

547
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:36,640
so powerful chris says i can

548
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,240
seem to focus on one bridge my mind

549
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,760
wanders between different types of

550
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,960
bridges that's okay

551
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:44,880
your mind could wander between bridges

552
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,000
perfectly fine you're still healing and

553
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,840
going through it and that's

554
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,280
part of the exercise it's part of the

555
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,280
healing part of it where you might

556
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:54,320
wander through the different bridges in

557
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,919
in your your mind but that means there's

558
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,520
also a lot going on in your neurons that

559
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:00,799
are healing

560
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,280
susan renee says susan renee perlman

561
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:04,400
says

562
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:06,080
i love the the rhyming poetry at the end

563
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,280
of each new podcast

564
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,280
is that the spirit of compassion's

565
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:11,039

incredible so

641
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,640
you know the thing is with the full moon

642
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,919
meditation you don't have to do on a

643
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,960
full moon you don't have to do a partial

644
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:51,600
moon you don't have to see the light

645
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,159
from the moon

646
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,919
but if you do it's incredible all of it

647
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:57,679
but the meditation is just as powerful

648
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:59,280
you can do it every single

649
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:01,440
day the link is in the description for

650
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:03,679
the moon meditation uh for the medical

651
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,840
meeting podcast at apple podcast that's

652
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,280
the uncensored version to listen to

653
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,880
that's the best place to listen to

654
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:11,919
better than any platform

655
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:14,080
there's poison that we collect that

656
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:16,640
resides inside of our soul when

657
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:18,400
you get betrayed when you have a loss

658
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,640
when you get a broken heart

659
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,960
when someone stabs you in the back when

660
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:26,240
broken trust happens like i said when

661
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:29,679
we have a loss when something

662
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,240
a confrontation whatever we go through

663
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:33,200
um

664
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,640
emotional emotional issues we have

665
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,159
meaning because someone's

666
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,960
you know we get allergic to somebody

667
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:41,200
because um they might be like

668
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,640
their emotions are really intense and it

669
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,039
might be really hard to

670
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,679
to to to work with it because when

671
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:47,600
people

672
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:49,679
are also going through so much they can

673
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,480
then you know then their emotions all of

674
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:52,000
a sudden

675
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,240
start you know we start taking them in

676
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,880
because we care so much so we need some

677
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,120
healing

678
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,240
and we need some healing and so with the

679
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,760
moon meditation does is the

680
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,880
gravitational pull

681
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,880
you'll see when you do the moon

682
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:05,520
meditation it

683
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,880
it showcases that color that yellow

684
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,679
color that i talk about in the

685
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,919
meditation

686
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:11,440
and then draws out the poison you really

687
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:16,080
have to experience it

688
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:17,600
um so ma'am says emma's he said a few
