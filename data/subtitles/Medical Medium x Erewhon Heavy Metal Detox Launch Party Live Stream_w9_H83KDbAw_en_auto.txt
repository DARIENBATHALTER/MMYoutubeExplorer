[2715.16 - 2719.92] you so so much our first speaker is
[2718.76 - 2722.92] Kelly
[2719.92 - 2725.88] Newman she is the writer director and
[2722.92 - 2728.24] producer of the 2017 awardwinning
[2725.88 - 2731.28] featurelength document
[2728.24 - 2733.28] heel all right so we're g to just bring
[2731.28 - 2736.36] her on up Kelly if you want to get on
[2733.28 - 2736.36] the stage I'll hand you this
[2753.24 - 2757.24] mic areful
[2757.96 - 2765.36] that e
[2760.44 - 2765.36] ACC be definitely the
[2767.60 - 2772.40] besteller um so Anthony came to I love
[2771.08 - 2773.36] the story of meeting Anthony because I
[2772.40 - 2776.80] was making
[2773.36 - 2776.80] the back
[2778.48 - 2783.36] 201 you haven't seen it yeton
[2803.12 - 2809.28] a moment of disappointment but she she
[2805.52 - 2810.52] offered me um Anthony she said you need
[2809.28 - 2813.00] if you're going to New York you need to
[2810.52 - 2818.04] meet Anthony William Kelly broen and
[2813.00 - 2819.92] Kelly Turner and so she said no but it
[2818.04 - 2823.52] led me to Anthony and two other
[2819.92 - 2827.36] brilliant people that made the film as
[2823.52 - 2829.76] powerful as it is so I just I love that
[2827.36 - 2833.16] story as a reminder that you know
[2829.76 - 2834.84] sometimes you get a know in life but you
[2833.16 - 2837.88] know rejection whatever you want to call
[2834.84 - 2839.59] it is God's redirection and protection
[2837.88 - 2841.20] so what a
[2839.59 - 2843.80] [Music]
[2841.20 - 2846.36] gift um and that brings me I I kind of
[2843.80 - 2848.16] just wanted to review speaking of Kelly
[2846.36 - 2850.64] Turner she did if you don't if you're
[2848.16 - 2852.56] not familiar she was um the researcher
[2850.64 - 2853.88] who wrote the book radical remission and
[2852.56 - 2857.52] she was
[2853.88 - 2859.80] so blown away by the possibility of
[2857.52 - 2861.52] spontaneous healing and she was not she
[2859.80 - 2863.68] was wondering why nobody was
[2861.52 - 2866.16] studying how those people healed they
[2863.68 - 2868.40] were kind of just dismissed in medicine
[2866.16 - 2870.44] as as anomalies and she's like but
[2868.40 - 2873.24] there's there's so many of them she kept
[2870.44 - 2875.80] thousands and thousands so she studied
[2873.24 - 2879.68] she made it her research project project
[2875.80 - 2881.64] and she studied like 1500 people that
[2879.68 - 2884.52] healed from cancers they were told they
[2881.64 - 2885.80] were not able to heal from so these were
[2884.52 - 2888.68] Radical
[2885.80 - 2893.20] remissions and she discovered that they
[2888.68 - 2895.88] did they all did 10 things consistently
[2893.20 - 2898.36] to heal that helped them heal and so she
[2895.88 - 2899.88] shared those things as the back when I
[2898.36 - 2902.08] made heal was only nine but then she
[2899.88 - 2904.80] added movement because they all did some
[2902.08 - 2906.96] sort of movement or exercise so it's now
[2904.80 - 2909.28] 10 things and I want to just read them
[2906.96 - 2912.32] to you to remind you because I don't
[2909.28 - 2914.76] think that this just applies to cancer I
[2912.32 - 2917.88] think it applies to all chronic illness
[2914.76 - 2921.68] in mystery illness um and the
[2917.88 - 2924.76] fascinating thing is out of those 10
[2921.68 - 2928.68] only three of them are physical so 30%
[2924.76 - 2931.56] is and the rest are mental emotional and
[2928.68 - 2934.00] spiritual and so let me read them
[2931.56 - 2935.72] because don't want to forget all right
[2934.00 - 2937.24] so the first one is radically changing
[2935.72 - 2939.64] your diet
[2937.24 - 2942.52] which obviously the medical medium
[2939.64 - 2945.28] information is going to help you do
[2942.52 - 2948.68] thank god um thank you Spirit of
[2945.28 - 2951.16] compassion and the second one is using
[2948.68 - 2954.28] herbs and supplements the third is
[2951.16 - 2957.20] movement exercise and just moving your
[2954.28 - 2959.36] body so those are the three physical and
[2957.20 - 2963.24] then it goes on to taking control of
[2959.36 - 2966.08] your health we've got to take our power
[2963.24 - 2967.40] back when it comes to Healing um the
[2966.08 - 2969.52] fourth one
[2967.40 - 2972.56] is following your intuition which I'm
[2969.52 - 2972.56] going to talk a little bit more
[2973.08 - 2980.76] about um then releasing suppressed
[2977.32 - 2983.68] emotions increasing positive
[2980.76 - 2985.80] emotions embracing social support we've
[2983.68 - 2988.84] got an amazing Community around
[2985.80 - 2992.00] us it's it's proven to help when you
[2988.84 - 2995.64] join cancer I think cancer survivors
[2992.00 - 2999.48] that joined um support groups are like
[2995.64 - 3002.56] 50% more likely to heal so Community is
[2999.48 - 3005.28] is massive um deepening your spiritual
[3002.56 - 3008.32] connection and having strong reasons for
[3005.28 - 3010.80] living so those are the essentials that
[3008.32 - 3012.72] people that spontaneously healed or
[3010.80 - 3015.20] healed when they were told they couldn't
[3012.72 - 3017.12] all did I think those are important but
[3015.20 - 3020.04] I wanted to talk a little bit about
[3017.12 - 3021.80] intuition because you know so many
[3020.04 - 3023.44] people back when I met Anthony he was
[3021.80 - 3026.96] still reading for
[3023.44 - 3031.80] people and you know I I seek out
[3026.96 - 3033.52] intuitives I seek out healers and you
[3031.80 - 3035.32] want that validation you want that
[3033.52 - 3038.48] support you want that feedback from
[3035.32 - 3041.60] people that have exceptional gifts but I
[3038.48 - 3044.44] think the time has come now to really
[3041.60 - 3047.08] hone your own instrument because our
[3044.44 - 3049.44] bodies are so brilliantly designed we're
[3047.08 - 3051.76] tuning Forks to the Divine we're all
[3049.44 - 3055.16] little fractals of the Divine and
[3051.76 - 3057.64] healing you know the root word for heal
[3055.16 - 3060.92] is actually wholeness
[3057.64 - 3063.60] and you know we are whole spiritually we
[3060.92 - 3065.96] are whole and perfect Divine beings and
[3063.60 - 3068.36] we come into this Human Experience and
[3065.96 - 3072.60] there's some distortions that come
[3068.36 - 3075.48] through um and so healing is is is
[3072.60 - 3078.76] remembering your Divinity
[3075.48 - 3081.08] and I feel like now in is a time in the
[3078.76 - 3083.24] world where we're inundated with so much
[3081.08 - 3086.04] information obviously there's a
[3083.24 - 3088.04] frequency change frequency is rising
[3086.04 - 3090.84] there's a lot of pressure on the planet
[3088.04 - 3092.96] and it's pressure to release our own
[3090.84 - 3097.56] gifts
[3092.96 - 3099.60] and so I know yeah so what I'm trying to
[3097.56 - 3103.56] say is that our bodies are brilliantly
[3099.60 - 3105.32] designed to be our biggest Aly in this
[3103.56 - 3107.80] you know we're Spiritual Beings in this
[3105.32 - 3110.56] human body and we all have even though
[3107.80 - 3113.28] Anthony has a spectacular amazing gift
[3110.56 - 3114.16] that is helping Millions access the
[3113.28 - 3118.64] healing
[3114.16 - 3121.08] within we all have our intuition is the
[3118.64 - 3123.32] strongest Truth for ourselves so now is
[3121.08 - 3125.16] the time to hone that instrument and
[3123.32 - 3126.84] it's okay to get feedback from other
[3125.16 - 3130.68] people to
[3126.84 - 3132.12] strengthen that um confidence in your
[3130.68 - 3136.48] own
[3132.12 - 3139.88] wisdom but with like the rise of AI and
[3136.48 - 3143.20] this artificial intelligence that is
[3139.88 - 3145.56] amazing in so many ways it becomes scary
[3143.20 - 3148.12] when we lose our discernment of what is
[3145.56 - 3152.08] reality and what's true truth and so now
[3148.12 - 3154.00] is the time to hone our own gifts and
[3152.08 - 3155.52] tune in to our own intuition because
[3154.00 - 3157.68] that is what's going to guide you on
[3155.52 - 3160.76] your journey and to your truth and and
[3157.68 - 3163.68] our bodies are designed to give you that
[3160.76 - 3166.80] feedback but we need to cleanse our
[3163.68 - 3171.60] instrument in order to um hear those
[3166.80 - 3175.40] messages clearly and so that's why we
[3171.60 - 3177.20] have to do the heavy metal detox and
[3175.40 - 3179.60] release depressed emot
[3177.20 - 3183.28] and do all these healing things and I
[3179.60 - 3186.32] think um I just want to remind people of
[3183.28 - 3189.32] their own gifts and to access them we
[3186.32 - 3191.88] have to keep our instrument as clean and
[3189.32 - 3192.64] pure as possible so that we can receive
[3191.88 - 3196.32] those
[3192.64 - 3198.44] messages to guide us on our way um and
[3196.32 - 3200.32] you all have that ability in you that's
[3198.44 - 3203.32] how brilliantly and beautifully we're
[3200.32 - 3203.32] designed
[3203.56 - 3205.28] [Applause]
[3203.70 - 3208.08] [Music]
[3205.28 - 3211.72] so um
[3208.08 - 3216.56] yeah and let's see I think we're GNA
[3211.72 - 3218.44] bring up Coya now to guide us through

[3218.44 - 3224.76] breathing and moving our bodies which is
[3221.40 - 3227.72] another way to get that instrument clear
[3224.76 - 3230.36] and high vibration change the frequency

[3335.24 - 3341.52] hey so it's just such an honor to be
[3338.28 - 3343.88] here to connect with you in community
[3341.52 - 3346.56] we've all been through this journey
[3343.88 - 3349.04] right of understanding who we truly are
[3346.56 - 3351.12] and our personal power so I'm going to
[3349.04 - 3355.08] go through a couple of exercises that
[3351.12 - 3358.08] have helped me when I felt down when I
[3355.08 - 3358.08] felt
[3361.72 - 3366.32] oh yeah she lives a healthy life and
[3364.32 - 3368.04] she's traveling the world with her
[3366.32 - 3369.08] fiance and she doesn't have a care in
[3368.04 - 3372.92] the
[3369.08 - 3375.36] world but what they don't know is that I
[3372.92 - 3377.56] experience High functional
[3375.36 - 3379.60] depression what they don't know and this
[3377.56 - 3383.08] is my first time sharing publicly was
[3379.60 - 3385.88] years ago when I got my blood work done
[3383.08 - 3388.32] I found out I was I had Lyme disease and
[3385.88 - 3391.12] I was fine I look just like I look today
[3388.32 - 3395.08] I had no symptoms but it came up in my
[3391.12 - 3398.60] blood work we are all in a very toxic
[3395.08 - 3401.24] World we're breathing in that every day
[3398.60 - 3403.56] so it's important while a lot of us see
[3401.24 - 3406.44] the symptoms some of us are experiencing
[3403.56 - 3410.52] things we have no idea about until it
[3406.44 - 3413.68] hits us like a ton of bricks so I stand
[3410.52 - 3416.84] with you not above or below but with and
[3413.68 - 3420.24] I truly think in community
[3416.84 - 3421.60] is the way we heal the best and so this
[3420.24 - 3423.52] practice I'm going to do with you is
[3421.60 - 3425.48] something that I do before every single
[3423.52 - 3427.36] meeting and it start with the breath
[3425.48 - 3430.16] because breath is spirit and it's our
[3427.36 - 3431.96] free tool that we have to regulate our
[3430.16 - 3434.64] system and even if you're on your
[3431.96 - 3436.36] hospital bed you can breathe to connect
[3434.64 - 3438.44] and to start the healing process are
[3436.36 - 3441.36] y'all down to that with
[3438.44 - 3444.16] me all right so everyone who can I
[3441.36 - 3446.24] invite you to stand to your
[3444.16 - 3448.60] feet yeah we're going to get some
[3446.24 - 3450.00] movement in because we're it's going to
[3448.60 - 3452.80] raise our vibration it's going to raise
[3450.00 - 3454.40] our energy we're going to inhale through
[3452.80 - 3456.72] the nose and we're going to let an
[3454.40 - 3458.64] audible sigh out of the mouth just a
[3456.72 - 3460.00] little bit of breathing just breathing
[3458.64 - 3463.08] take a deep
[3460.00 - 3465.88] inhale exhale sigh it
[3463.08 - 3469.16] out Breathe In
[3465.88 - 3471.96] Love exhale
[3469.16 - 3474.84] fear breathe in
[3471.96 - 3477.24] peace exhale
[3474.84 - 3480.40] chaos in
[3477.24 - 3482.28] inhale and exhale you might start
[3480.40 - 3484.00] feeling energy moving move your body a
[3482.28 - 3487.00] little bit you're like yeah that feels
[3484.00 - 3489.68] good yeah we are alive we are living
[3487.00 - 3491.64] beings we're meant to move and smile and
[3489.68 - 3493.32] laugh even though we go through those
[3491.64 - 3495.20] moments when we can't get off the couch
[3493.32 - 3497.44] and can't be happy so if you want to
[3495.20 - 3502.92] laugh you want to yell at any time I
[3497.44 - 3507.20] invite you yes yes yes fully expressed
[3502.92 - 3509.08] fully expressed fully expressed
[3507.20 - 3511.32] absolutely because that's the way we
[3509.08 - 3513.56] release fear that's the way we release
[3511.32 - 3516.20] trauma that's the way we release lower
[3513.56 - 3517.68] vibrations that don't serve us right all
[3516.20 - 3519.44] right so the next thing we're going to
[3517.68 - 3521.40] do is like an energy release it's a
[3519.44 - 3524.00] somatic practice we're going to inhale
[3521.40 - 3526.48] bring the arms up if you can and exhale
[3524.00 - 3532.12] bring them back behind you
[3526.48 - 3535.60] inhale exhale inhale love exhale fear
[3532.12 - 3537.56] inhale exhale any negative energy you
[3535.60 - 3539.88] experience on the way here at the
[3537.56 - 3541.84] grocery store maybe on the drive we're
[3539.88 - 3543.88] going to release that right now because
[3541.84 - 3546.12] when you release low vibrations what do
[3543.88 - 3548.32] you do you align yourself with the
[3546.12 - 3551.04] highest and most powerful version of
[3548.32 - 3552.56] yourself from that place you can heal
[3551.04 - 3555.48] she's doing it with the dog that's what
[3552.56 - 3557.96] I'm talking about one more time inhale
[3555.48 - 3559.68] and exhale Let It Go all right now move
[3557.96 - 3561.52] around dance around dance around dance
[3559.68 - 3564.56] around all right now we can relax a
[3561.52 - 3568.48] little bit right did that feel
[3564.56 - 3570.56] good all right awesome so what I love to
[3568.48 - 3573.36] do is really start with these six areas
[3570.56 - 3576.36] of well-being the first area is
[3573.36 - 3578.12] spiritual well-being right and for
[3576.36 - 3581.20] Spiritual well-being that's how we
[3578.12 - 3583.48] connect as Kelly said to our divine self
[3581.20 - 3586.16] when we are well and we are connected in
[3583.48 - 3589.16] Divine Alignment with our source we get
[3586.16 - 3591.52] the Divine downloads to heal and all of
[3589.16 - 3593.32] us are unique some of us more powerful
[3591.52 - 3596.24] than others because we've tapped in a
[3593.32 - 3600.04] lot like Anthony I mean give a run of a
[3596.24 - 3603.16] for Anthony y'all he does a lot of
[3600.04 - 3604.64] incredible work despite being ridiculed
[3603.16 - 3606.68] despite being touch I'm going to need
[3604.64 - 3610.28] you to be a little bit louder because
[3606.68 - 3613.36] it's not easy it's not easy to lead this
[3610.28 - 3616.56] charge it's not easy to do this work and
[3613.36 - 3618.64] it's not easy to keep going when
[3616.56 - 3619.88] everywhere around you no matter how much
[3618.64 - 3621.88] good work you do you're being turned
[3619.88 - 3624.16] down so I just need to give him his
[3621.88 - 3626.36] flowers while he's here and rushing out
[3624.16 - 3628.56] and now I want to give you your flowers
[3626.36 - 3631.00] give yourself a round of applause for
[3628.56 - 3633.12] showing up for standing in line to
[3631.00 - 3636.76] buying those smoothies to doing
[3633.12 - 3639.32] everything you needed to do to get here
[3636.76 - 3642.00] this is called celebration there's a lot
[3639.32 - 3644.16] of crazy things going on in the world
[3642.00 - 3646.68] but one thing to spiritually align is
[3644.16 - 3648.88] gratitude gratitude for your life
[3646.68 - 3650.84] gratitude for your family gratitude for
[3648.88 - 3652.84] your community and gratitude for our
[3650.84 - 3654.56] leaders so give yourself another round
[3652.84 - 3657.84] of applause because you've been through
[3654.56 - 3661.92] a lot to get here you're here
[3657.84 - 3664.88] shining when you are well the world is a
[3661.92 - 3666.84] better place to be when you are well
[3664.88 - 3670.08] your family is well and so long we're
[3666.84 - 3673.92] like oh put yourself last when did we
[3670.08 - 3675.96] start that why did we start that because
[3673.92 - 3678.44] we all know when you are well everyone
[3675.96 - 3680.32] around you is well so raise your hand if
[3678.44 - 3681.84] you're going to commit to prioritizing
[3680.32 - 3684.20] your
[3681.84 - 3686.56] well-being I don't have everybody yet
[3684.20 - 3689.16] raise your hand if you want to commit to
[3686.56 - 3691.44] prioritizing loving on yourself first
[3689.16 - 3694.48] and most because you know when you love
[3691.44 - 3696.68] on yourself everybody else benefits all
[3694.48 - 3698.52] right put your hand down all right so
[3696.68 - 3699.84] that's spiritual well-being just really
[3698.52 - 3701.64] activating through the breath through
[3699.84 - 3704.08] movement so you can Divine a line
[3701.64 - 3705.64] despite what happens to you so whenever
[3704.08 - 3708.12] you're frustrated on this journey on
[3705.64 - 3710.76] your journey home remember your tools of
[3708.12 - 3712.88] breath to regulate your nervous system
[3710.76 - 3715.92] bring you back into that parasympathetic
[3712.88 - 3719.00] alignment so you can rest digest and
[3715.92 - 3721.20] come back to love every single time I
[3719.00 - 3723.28] was on Kelly's podcast yesterday and we
[3721.20 - 3724.64] were talking about heated stuff and we
[3723.28 - 3725.84] were both energetically charged and
[3724.64 - 3727.24] she's like oh I didn't want to end the
[3725.84 - 3728.92] podcast this way I was like cool we'll
[3727.24 - 3731.68] change it right now and we went into
[3728.92 - 3734.36] breath and we left on a very high note
[3731.68 - 3736.24] so you can do it just like that right
[3734.36 - 3737.84] but sometimes it's not easy sometimes
[3736.24 - 3739.72] you need to move sometimes you need to
[3737.84 - 3742.12] shake sometimes you need to take herbs
[3739.72 - 3744.60] and supplements that help you come down
[3742.12 - 3747.08] and come back to your truth but remember
[3744.60 - 3748.96] your tools every single time cuz no
[3747.08 - 3751.56] matter how far you get in your healing
[3748.96 - 3754.48] Journey because we live in a toxic world
[3751.56 - 3757.08] you need your tools to stay healthy all
[3754.48 - 3759.24] right the second is emotional regulation
[3757.08 - 3761.56] and emotional well-being how many people
[3759.24 - 3764.72] know how to regulate your
[3761.56 - 3766.20] emotions okay that's less than 1% all
[3764.72 - 3768.28] right so we're going to work on that so
[3766.20 - 3769.92] the first thing I want you to do is
[3768.28 - 3771.28] think about how you feel place your
[3769.92 - 3773.60] right hand on your
[3771.28 - 3775.84] heart and I invite you to close your
[3773.60 - 3778.92] eyes or gaze down at the ground if you
[3775.84 - 3780.88] you feel safe if not do whatever feels
[3778.92 - 3783.84] good to you now take a deep
[3780.88 - 3785.80] inhale and exhale sigh it
[3783.84 - 3788.32] up another
[3785.80 - 3790.80] inhale and exhale side it
[3788.32 - 3795.00] out if one
[3790.80 - 3797.56] word could describe how you feel right
[3795.00 - 3802.20] now what would that word
[3797.56 - 3806.20] be joyful okay love
[3802.20 - 3806.20] peace life
[3806.32 - 3809.92] light
[3808.00 - 3813.60] hope
[3809.92 - 3816.12] thankful yes yes
[3813.60 - 3818.16] grateful yes take a deep
[3816.12 - 3820.60] inhale and
[3818.16 - 3823.00] exhale now I'm not an all rainbows and
[3820.60 - 3825.92] unicorns type of person so let's think
[3823.00 - 3828.36] about the last week if you felt anything
[3825.92 - 3831.76] outside of love let's be honest about
[3828.36 - 3834.12] that emotion too I'll start
[3831.76 - 3836.28] frustration I got another one
[3834.12 - 3838.52] overwhelmed what about you
[3836.28 - 3843.88] fear
[3838.52 - 3847.36] uhhuh anybody else anger
[3843.88 - 3852.04] yeah anxiety
[3847.36 - 3854.04] yeah depression yeah it's okay to
[3852.04 - 3856.60] acknowledge when you're not feeling your
[3854.04 - 3859.40] best it's okay to acknowledge when
[3856.60 - 3862.36] you're not well because it's in that
[3859.40 - 3864.88] acknowledgement that the healing starts
[3862.36 - 3867.36] right if I never knew and never was just
[3864.88 - 3870.04] doing this random activation with a
[3867.36 - 3872.24] company I would have never known that I
[3870.04 - 3873.96] needed to do some more things in my life
[3872.24 - 3876.72] to improve my well-being even though I
[3873.96 - 3878.68] felt good and then I just started my
[3876.72 - 3880.88] fertility journey I found out oh you're
[3878.68 - 3883.68] still low in DHEA you're still I'm like
[3880.88 - 3887.12] what I feel great but the numbers are
[3883.68 - 3890.16] telling me the truth right so I took
[3887.12 - 3892.40] that frustration and took control of my
[3890.16 - 3894.08] life and said all right I'll add some
[3892.40 - 3896.64] more herbs and supplements because I
[3894.08 - 3899.28] know how what that does for my
[3896.64 - 3901.36] so remember don't feel alone if you feel
[3899.28 - 3903.12] like man I'm taking like 15,000
[3901.36 - 3907.24] supplements how many people are taking
[3903.12 - 3909.84] like 15,000 supplements okay yeah give
[3907.24 - 3914.52] it up for yourself because whatever it
[3909.84 - 3916.92] takes to be well right and I can say
[3914.52 - 3918.24] when I started to do these things the
[3916.92 - 3920.48] spiritual wellbeing the emotional
[3918.24 - 3922.64] well-being I feel better than I've ever
[3920.48 - 3924.28] felt in my life shout out if you feel
[3922.64 - 3927.56] better today than you've ever felt in

[3929.68 - 3933.71] for me and for you if Anthony's a big
[3931.44 - 3935.76] part of that let's make some
[3933.71 - 3939.84] [Applause]
[3935.76 - 3943.84] noise yeah yeah because it takes leaders
[3939.84 - 3946.84] like Anthony to help wake us up
[3943.84 - 3949.64] inspiration is becoming in
[3946.84 - 3952.92] spirit and not only is Anthony
[3949.64 - 3955.16] inspirational but each one of you is
[3952.92 - 3957.92] inspirational not by telling everybody
[3955.16 - 3962.24] but that's good to but by
[3957.92 - 3964.16] being the light being love choosing not
[3962.24 - 3965.48] to curse that person out even though
[3964.16 - 3969.00] they pissed you
[3965.48 - 3971.20] off choosing love when it's hard
[3969.00 - 3974.72] choosing love when it's sick choosing to
[3971.20 - 3976.32] do whatever you need to do to be well so
[3974.72 - 3978.20] next we're going to go into nutritional

[4003.24 - 4006.60] heard all three of those that's great
[4004.56 - 4009.76] but I think I there's a consensus out
[4006.60 - 4011.68] here we love cleanse to heal and we all
[4009.76 - 4014.12] love all the books because they're all
[4011.68 - 4017.20] equally powerful in helping us go to the
[4014.12 - 4019.32] next level so y'all AA so that
[4017.20 - 4022.12] information in that book has helped so
[4019.32 - 4023.40] many of my clients and my communities I
[4022.12 - 4026.92] feel like I'm
[4023.40 - 4028.80] forever no matter what going to support
[4026.92 - 4031.08] and guess what we're all humans so guess
[4028.80 - 4032.04] what humans aren't perfect right humans
[4031.08 - 4035.76] aren't
[4032.04 - 4039.84] what humans aren't what so I don't have
[4035.76 - 4043.08] to be humans aren't what so I don't have
[4039.84 - 4045.56] to be perfect yes so many times we feel
[4043.08 - 4048.00] like we have to be perfect to be well no
[4045.56 - 4049.60] we have to be perfect to be loved we
[4048.00 - 4051.72] have to get everything right and if we
[4049.60 - 4054.76] don't we go into this spiral of guilt
[4051.72 - 4057.00] and shame and remorse no you don't have
[4054.76 - 4058.56] to be perfect to be great you don't have
[4057.00 - 4061.28] to be perfect to be well this is an
[4058.56 - 4063.36] ongoing journey and I don't know anybody
[4061.28 - 4065.08] and I've worked with and had some of the
[4063.36 - 4067.68] incredible most incredible light workers
[4065.08 - 4071.64] in the world on my podcast we've worked
[4067.68 - 4073.92] together and I have not met one perfect
[4071.64 - 4075.68] person now some people are close like
[4073.92 - 4077.72] Anthony oh yeah you're welcome to sit
[4075.68 - 4080.12] down if you want to sit down y feet y
[4077.72 - 4084.08] feet feeling good y'all
[4080.12 - 4086.48] okay not one perfect person right I had
[4084.08 - 4090.52] y'all standing up forever see I'm not
[4086.48 - 4093.12] perfect sorry but it feels good to just
[4090.52 - 4095.84] own the fact that we all have some flaws
[4093.12 - 4098.96] here and there and in our health Journey
[4095.84 - 4101.32] we don't have to have it perfect
[4098.96 - 4103.48] physically physical well-being is also
[4101.32 - 4106.12] important where to be walking or dancing
[4103.48 - 4107.92] or yoga
[4106.12 - 4111.12] I want you guys to shout out what do you
[4107.92 - 4114.24] do for a movement one two
[4111.12 - 4118.36] three oh you know what I heard the most
[4114.24 - 4121.24] dancing right yes how many people love
[4118.36 - 4123.36] dancing yes dancing is one of the best
[4121.24 - 4125.76] ways to move your body get that movement
[4123.36 - 4128.64] in your joints and ligaments and also it
[4125.76 - 4130.20] releases endorsement so you feel better
[4128.64 - 4133.08] and you release the dopamine and you
[4130.20 - 4135.20] feel good in your body so moving every
[4133.08 - 4137.64] day even if you can't go to the gym even
[4135.20 - 4139.68] if you can't leave lift heavy weights
[4137.64 - 4142.20] just dancing around moving your body or
[4139.68 - 4144.80] just shaking it's so good or if you're
[4142.20 - 4147.32] just in your bed just you know moving
[4144.80 - 4148.60] around a little bit is waking you up to
[4147.32 - 4150.96] your true
[4148.60 - 4152.44] self and then the next area of
[4150.96 - 4155.16] well-being that I
[4152.44 - 4157.36] teach is social well-being you all are
[4155.16 - 4160.80] doing it now for being out here in
[4157.36 - 4164.04] community we are not in this Jony alone
[4160.80 - 4166.80] but sometimes when you're sick you feel
[4164.04 - 4168.24] alone sometimes when you experiencing
[4166.80 - 4169.72] something you never heard of before you
[4168.24 - 4171.24] feel alone sometimes when you get a
[4169.72 - 4173.92] diagnosis and they tell you you can't
[4171.24 - 4176.04] heal you feel
[4173.92 - 4177.56] alone but the truth is you're never
[4176.04 - 4179.88] alone look around you look at all these
[4177.56 - 4183.12] people still people in line just look
[4179.88 - 4187.16] around make ey contact with
[4183.12 - 4187.16] someone and tell them you are not
[4187.24 - 4192.12] alone you are not alone my fiance just
[4190.76 - 4193.84] looked at me and said you're not alone
[4192.12 - 4197.32] that's why I love him yo give give my
[4193.84 - 4197.32] fiance a round of applause
[4199.44 - 4203.44] I'm
[4200.60 - 4205.32] 42 and there was a time in my life where
[4203.44 - 4208.16] I gave up on love I felt like you know
[4205.32 - 4210.28] what I've been dating the most toxic
[4208.16 - 4211.76] humans and some of you might be able to
[4210.28 - 4214.20] relate and I'm like you know what maybe
[4211.76 - 4216.40] it's just not for me in this
[4214.20 - 4218.52] lifetime but I had some healing to do
[4216.40 - 4220.84] she's like don't put me out sis but it's
[4218.52 - 4224.00] okay I feel you I'm with you
[4220.84 - 4225.64] right but then I did some deeper healing
[4224.00 - 4228.04] work
[4225.64 - 4231.04] and I reached out to my mentors and my
[4228.04 - 4235.04] leaders and I felt like I had a I had
[4231.04 - 4237.68] some fatherhood trauma that I needed to
[4235.04 - 4239.76] heal I had some experiences that
[4237.68 - 4242.60] happened to me including assault that I
[4239.76 - 4246.04] need to heal from and I did that work
[4242.60 - 4246.04] and guess what we're getting married in
[4246.24 - 4250.32] November thank you but it's because I
[4249.08 - 4253.68] didn't give

[4253.68 - 4258.00] you but talk with you we can't give up
[4256.64 - 4259.72] even though it's hard even though we
[4258.00 - 4262.76] spilled a lot of trauma even though we
[4259.72 - 4266.76] get a lot of hard diagnosis we can never
[4262.76 - 4268.48] give up on love never give up on health
[4266.76 - 4269.76] never give up on trying because you
[4268.48 - 4270.84] never know when you're going to have
[4269.76 - 4273.16] your
[4270.84 - 4276.48] breakthrough you never know when your
[4273.16 - 4277.76] health is going to go to the next level
[4276.48 - 4280.48] and the last area of well-being I'm
[4277.76 - 4282.68] going to talk to you about is financial
[4280.48 - 4284.08] well-being how many people know finances
[4282.68 - 4286.76] is
[4284.08 - 4289.08] important yeah yeah but we don't talk

[4568.84 - 4574.48] you have actually experienced it the
[4570.72 - 4577.12] last one I did publicly or live in in a
[4574.48 - 4580.16] physical form was probably nine years
[4577.12 - 4583.04] ago okay we've done them virtually many
[4580.16 - 4585.12] of you might have experienced it right
[4583.04 - 4587.80] have you
[4585.12 - 4590.56] yep it's pretty intense but it's going
[4587.80 - 4593.80] to be great it's going to be great okay
[4590.56 - 4596.80] so since I was 4 years old Spirit of
[4593.80 - 4601.32] compassion taught me about this light
[4596.80 - 4603.56] that can come down if spirit and I are
[4601.32 - 4607.00] communicating and this light can come
[4603.56 - 4609.12] down so when I was a child I used the
[4607.00 - 4612.24] light to heal
[4609.12 - 4614.56] animals so if there was a baby bird with
[4612.24 - 4616.08] a broken wing I would ask Spirit send
[4614.56 - 4619.16] down the
[4616.08 - 4620.40] light if there was an injured dog or an
[4619.16 - 4624.32] injured
[4620.40 - 4625.72] cat or an injured animal or a turtle I
[4624.32 - 4627.96] would ask Spirit of compassion to send
[4625.72 - 4629.88] down the light and then if I was driving
[4627.96 - 4631.76] in the car with my family and I was in
[4629.88 - 4635.36] the back
[4631.76 - 4638.28] seat and driving by people and then
[4635.36 - 4641.60] getting readings that people needed help
[4638.28 - 4643.28] or their health was was in some kind of
[4641.60 - 4645.24] condition where they were struggling I
[4643.28 - 4647.60] would be in the backseat of the car 8
[4645.24 - 4649.80] years old 7 years old and I would say
[4647.60 - 4652.24] send the light down that's what I would
[4649.80 - 4654.40] do and the spirit of compassion taught
[4652.24 - 4657.48] me how to use this light and I've
[4654.40 - 4660.36] learned how to work with spirit with
[4657.48 - 4661.80] this and so what's going to happen here
[4660.36 - 4663.48] is the light's going to come down and
[4661.80 - 4666.72] it's going to hit the top of everybody's
[4663.48 - 4669.40] head that's where it's going to
[4666.72 - 4671.72] hit it's not going to hit their shoulder
[4669.40 - 4674.08] or their arm or their hand but it's it's
[4671.72 - 4675.92] going to hit the crown of everybody's
[4674.08 - 4678.12] head here
[4675.92 - 4680.76] and even going as far back from what
[4678.12 - 4682.68] spirit's telling me even far back there
[4680.76 - 4683.92] all the way there and in the line over
[4682.68 - 4687.68] there
[4683.92 - 4690.52] too okay think about what you want
[4687.68 - 4693.80] better in your life think about what you
[4690.52 - 4695.80] want healed in your life think about
[4693.80 - 4698.84] where you want the light
[4695.80 - 4702.88] directed where is it that you want it
[4698.84 - 4705.60] directed is it your heart is it your
[4702.88 - 4708.72] kidney right is it your
[4705.60 - 4711.32] back is it a loved one too that's
[4708.72 - 4712.40] somewhere else and maybe try to direct
[4711.32 - 4715.76] it to
[4712.40 - 4718.20] them but either way it's coming down and
[4715.76 - 4719.80] it's going to hit the top of our heads
[4718.20 - 4721.44] okay so what's going to happen is I'm
[4719.80 - 4722.84] going to ask you to take a quick breath
[4721.44 - 4725.08] you're going to hold it and then I'm
[4722.84 - 4726.72] going to tell you to release and right
[4725.08 - 4729.12] when we take that breath and hold it for
[4726.72 - 4732.60] that second the light's going to come
[4729.12 - 4735.24] down right on top of everybody's head
[4732.60 - 4737.56] okay now this light
[4735.24 - 4739.68] some may see it some may not a lot of
[4737.56 - 4742.64] people do they close their eyes and they
[4739.68 - 4745.28] see it a lot of people feel it
[4742.64 - 4747.96] immediately you might feel tingles you
[4745.28 - 4751.68] might feel a funny feeling in your body
[4747.96 - 4754.76] you might feel even a little bit of Joy
[4751.68 - 4756.28] pop up you might giggle but something's
[4754.76 - 4758.60] going to
[4756.28 - 4760.96] happen now this light's going to stay in
[4758.60 - 4763.92] you for today and tomorrow and the
[4760.96 - 4766.72] effects of it can even go as long as
[4763.92 - 4769.08] weeks after after this and a lot of
[4766.72 - 4770.84] people things change for them they their
[4769.08 - 4773.12] their healing is
[4770.84 - 4774.40] ignited because that's what it has done
[4773.12 - 4776.84] for so
[4774.40 - 4780.44] many there the reason why I don't do a
[4776.84 - 4782.12] lot of them it's pretty intense takes a
[4780.44 - 4784.24] lot out of me but that's okay because
[4782.12 - 4789.88] this is the time to do it if there's any
[4784.24 - 4789.88] time to ever do it it's now it's now
[4796.32 - 4800.40] we're going to do it a couple of times
[4798.32 - 4803.56] now A lot of people have blockages in
[4800.40 - 4805.64] them they have emotional
[4803.56 - 4807.32] blocks maybe they picked up some
[4805.64 - 4809.96] negative energy not because they're a
[4807.32 - 4812.92] bad person because they happen to be
[4809.96 - 4814.88] around negative energy somewhere right A
[4812.92 - 4816.96] lot of people have been misunderstood
[4814.88 - 4818.68] you guys have been judged along the way
[4816.96 - 4822.60] the medical medium crowd is the toughest
[4818.68 - 4825.44] crowd though the toughest crowd there
[4822.60 - 4826.92] is and it's the only heal Community
[4825.44 - 4828.88] where people have come back from
[4826.92 - 4830.76] wheelchairs they've come back from the
[4828.88 - 4833.52] worst conditions they've risen out of
[4830.76 - 4836.56] the ashes okay so I know you guys are
[4833.52 - 4836.56] tough you guys are
[4836.64 - 4841.80] strong think about where you want that
[4839.00 - 4844.04] light directed inside your body and even
[4841.80 - 4846.04] if for some reason you have it directed
[4844.04 - 4852.24] to some place in your body like your
[4846.04 - 4855.32] brain or your heart or your soul or your
[4852.24 - 4857.84] soul anything can happen
[4855.32 - 4861.16] when that light goes into us anything
[4857.84 - 4864.12] can happen anything even if you say I
[4861.16 - 4865.44] wanted to make my heart better that
[4864.12 - 4868.72] light's going to run through all of us
[4865.44 - 4870.92] now many of us have blockages like I was
[4868.72 - 4872.64] saying before and it may take a little
[4870.92 - 4874.08] bit of time to get the light all the way
[4872.64 - 4875.36] through to everybody but there's a lot
[4874.08 - 4876.88] of people here it's going to go right
[4875.36 - 4879.40] through them right from the top of their
[4876.88 - 4881.28] head down to the ground but a lot of
[4879.40 - 4882.96] people it's going to get stuck somewhere
[4881.28 - 4884.36] some people it's going to get stuck here
[4882.96 - 4885.92] some people it's going to stop here so
[4884.36 - 4888.20] we're going to do it until Spirit of
[4885.92 - 4890.20] compassion says enough people it went
[4888.20 - 4891.76] through and down to the
[4890.20 - 4894.52] ground
[4891.76 - 4895.20] okay we'll see how we'll see how blocked
[4894.52 - 4898.16] we
[4895.20 - 4901.16] are we'll see how many emotional
[4898.16 - 4901.16] blockages
[4901.84 - 4908.12] okay definitely I talked to S so before
[4905.84 - 4910.72] this event and I wanted that to happen
[4908.12 - 4912.92] direct the light to somebody else okay
[4910.72 - 4914.64] if you have to you'll still get it but
[4912.92 - 4915.40] it's also going to go to somebody else a
[4914.64 - 4919.32] little
[4915.40 - 4921.00] bit okay so let's get ready we sit down

[7594.88 - 7601.56] it um I really believe it's like in my
[7598.40 - 7605.12] curiosity and passion for truth that led
[7601.56 - 7607.84] me to be here on the stage today and I
[7605.12 - 7610.20] know you're all truth Seekers yourself
[7607.84 - 7613.32] um I'm just going to say uh my first
[7610.20 - 7616.76] light blast with Anthony was back in
[7613.32 - 7618.44] 2015 uh in Connecticut and that was such
[7616.76 - 7620.92] a powerful event and I'm sure some of
[7618.44 - 7622.68] you might have been there um it was
[7620.92 - 7624.56] quite the experience of feeling that
[7622.68 - 7627.16] light and I had been studying with other
[7624.56 - 7628.96] teachers at that time and other uh
[7627.16 - 7632.44] experiences of energy and it was just
[7628.96 - 7635.56] something so different and so incredible
[7632.44 - 7640.96] um but um I just wanted to give a little
[7635.56 - 7643.76] story about when I um when I came to uh
[7640.96 - 7645.60] the airport to come here today uh I ran
[7643.76 - 7647.28] into a family who actually called out my
[7645.60 - 7649.56] name and said hey Dr shery Green and I
[7647.28 - 7651.52] turned around and it's the Rini family
[7649.56 - 7655.20] who I didn't know in person I only knew
[7651.52 - 7658.32] them by uh Instagram name and they were
[7655.20 - 7660.92] just it was so nice to when you feel
[7658.32 - 7663.52] like you're in the middle of you're not
[7660.92 - 7666.12] seen or you're not heard or or you're
[7663.52 - 7667.80] isolated all of those feelings that you
[7666.12 - 7669.56] know when you're doing something so
[7667.80 - 7671.72] different than the rest of the world and
[7669.56 - 7673.48] how important it is to meet the these
[7671.72 - 7676.48] kindred spirits that show up on your
[7673.48 - 7677.96] path and we compared food bags and like
[7676.48 - 7680.48] how much food we were pcking on the
[7677.96 - 7682.60] plane and to get here so that was really
[7680.48 - 7687.04] fun and when I got here today and just
[7682.60 - 7691.16] circled Awan and saw these smiling faces
[7687.04 - 7693.04] and just this event today is just so
[7691.16 - 7695.68] magical and I feel like I've definitely
[7693.04 - 7699.76] waited a lifetime to be right here in
[7695.68 - 7701.96] this position right now so
[7699.76 - 7704.04] anyway um I do
[7701.96 - 7705.68] I did write a speech out because I
[7704.04 - 7708.96] really don't want to forget some
[7705.68 - 7713.24] important points that I want to uh call
[7708.96 - 7713.24] out today so bear with me
[7716.88 - 7721.68] here there are a few moments throughout
[7719.48 - 7724.60] our lifetime that truly take our Breath

[7779.20 - 7783.36] coincidences for me being here

[7783.36 - 7788.36] cherished dream to transform our broken
[7786.56 - 7792.04] medical system and reimagine the
[7788.36 - 7792.04] landscape of healing
[7792.80 - 7798.04] yeah absolutely no longer would those
[7795.44 - 7800.52] suffering from chronic illness feel lost
[7798.04 - 7803.20] their conditions unresolved and labeled
[7800.52 - 7806.16] with no real answers in sight we have
[7803.20 - 7809.68] real answers now the Pearls of Wisdom in
[7806.16 - 7813.92] these books podcast lives and emails are
[7809.68 - 7813.92] Priceless and not to be taken for
[7814.00 - 7818.24] granted my life was forever changed when
[7816.44 - 7820.80] I discovered medical medium information
[7818.24 - 7823.12] in 2015 through a dear friend of mine
[7820.80 - 7825.72] who was also also suffering during my
[7823.12 - 7828.44] own healing journey to L to a heal a
[7825.72 - 7829.96] list of disabling chronic symptoms I
[7828.44 - 7832.04] just knew that this was something
[7829.96 - 7834.60] extraordinarily special and different
[7832.04 - 7837.88] from anything I had ever researched or
[7834.60 - 7841.00] studied before and I had studied a
[7837.88 - 7843.80] lot my first call with Anthony in 20 the
[7841.00 - 7845.68] November of 2015 turned my world and
[7843.80 - 7848.12] practice upside down in the most
[7845.68 - 7850.88] beautiful and enlightening way with the
[7848.12 - 7853.28] invaluable knowledge he has gifted us we
[7850.88 - 7855.96] can now now perceive root causes like
[7853.28 - 7858.96] never before I've witnessed incredible
[7855.96 - 7861.20] healings unfolding before my eyes I
[7858.96 - 7863.32] understand the profound workings of the
[7861.20 - 7866.16] human body and spirit in ways I could
[7863.32 - 7868.28] have only dreamed this is true deep
[7866.16 - 7869.52] multi-dimensional healing of the Mind
[7868.28 - 7872.24] Body and
[7869.52 - 7875.36] Soul I personally have needed to stand
[7872.24 - 7877.36] strong amongst the doubters naysayers
[7875.36 - 7880.16] professional colleagues and bullies in
[7877.36 - 7882.96] my own field as I know you all have
[7880.16 - 7885.44] faced as well
[7882.96 - 7887.88] the commonality for us is when the truth
[7885.44 - 7891.28] is felt within we don't just back down
[7887.88 - 7893.88] or walk away we can't it's an unspoken
[7891.28 - 7896.08] drive from the heart spirit and soul we
[7893.88 - 7898.80] need this Divine guidance to navate
[7896.08 - 7901.44] navigate the incredibly complex chronic
[7898.80 - 7904.16] illnesses we are facing today afflicting
[7901.44 - 7905.00] our patients our families our friends
[7904.16 - 7907.52] and
[7905.00 - 7909.36] neighbors I pray more people open their
[7907.52 - 7911.52] hearts and Minds to embrace this
[7909.36 - 7914.12] information no matter how difficult the
[7911.52 - 7916.08] lifestyle changes may seem and I pray
[7914.12 - 7918.76] that practitioners across all Medical
[7916.08 - 7921.48] Specialties find the courage to come out
[7918.76 - 7924.44] of the closet and share these teachings
[7921.48 - 7927.32] far and wide I pray the rest of these
[7924.44 - 7930.20] sacred teachings to be to continue to be
[7927.32 - 7932.20] revealed unobstructed we all deserve
[7930.20 - 7935.00] true healing it is our
[7932.20 - 7938.24] Birthright I pray this information stays
[7935.00 - 7938.24] sacred and
[7939.96 - 7945.68] safe and then passed on and on through
[7942.72 - 7947.40] the generations to come that will need
[7945.68 - 7950.24] this information more than ever to
[7947.40 - 7953.04] ensure Humanity continues to thrive and
[7950.24 - 7956.56] this planet is

[8450.04 - 8455.00] speaking
[8452.24 - 8460.28] and I just want to say a few things but
[8455.00 - 8463.92] first I want to begin with my heart is
[8460.28 - 8465.04] truly with everyone that wasn't able to
[8463.92 - 8467.48] come
[8465.04 - 8469.56] here for whatever
[8467.48 - 8474.28] reason
[8469.56 - 8477.68] and I just know that we all love and
[8474.28 - 8480.16] care about you and know that you are in
[8477.68 - 8481.48] our thoughts so that's what I want to
[8480.16 - 8487.36] start off
[8481.48 - 8491.56] with um thank you so Underdog Warriors
[8487.36 - 8495.12] is a 501c3 not for-profit
[8491.56 - 8496.64] Corporation and I am one of the
[8495.12 - 8499.12] co-founders
[8496.64 - 8500.76] so this
[8499.12 - 8504.60] organization
[8500.76 - 8506.60] began due to my own
[8504.60 - 8511.80] experience
[8506.60 - 8515.36] and I remember being in
[8511.80 - 8518.68] and then in this small office and just
[8515.36 - 8521.96] kind of walking back and forth and then
[8518.68 - 8525.24] this idea came to me and it was one of
[8521.96 - 8529.56] those things that felt like an Angelic
[8525.24 - 8531.56] moment and that was it I felt that an
[8529.56 - 8534.28] organization needed to be started to
[8531.56 - 8540.28] help support people that didn't have the
[8534.28 - 8540.28] financial means to support their healing
[8541.36 - 8548.76] that was me for a very very long
[8545.12 - 8553.96] time I didn't have the support I
[8548.76 - 8556.52] needed I would watch people online make
[8553.96 - 8558.44] their micro shock
[8556.52 - 8561.72] therapies
[8558.44 - 8565.68] and I didn't have the means to purchase
[8561.72 - 8568.64] the micro to make my micro shock therapy
[8565.68 - 8571.00] so I would watch people online and I
[8568.64 - 8574.44] just knew that there would be a time
[8571.00 - 8577.28] where I would have the opportunities
[8574.44 - 8579.84] that I needed come my way and and to
[8577.28 - 8583.20] feel better whether it was
[8579.84 - 8585.96] physically emotionally spiritually just
[8583.20 - 8587.00] to feel better in all in every sense of
[8585.96 - 8590.64] the
[8587.00 - 8594.24] way and so that's really how it came
[8590.64 - 8595.12] about and Underdog Warriors was formed
[8594.24 - 8599.68] the
[8595.12 - 8604.08] name I'm not quite sure how I coined it
[8599.68 - 8606.60] together but I just knew that we are The
[8604.08 - 8610.40] Underdogs we are the people that aren't
[8606.60 - 8612.40] seen out there that are held back that
[8610.40 - 8614.92] our voice isn't
[8612.40 - 8617.60] heard and that really doesn't come until
[8614.92 - 8621.28] we come out of it but I've also learned
[8617.60 - 8624.44] that during the process you do find your
[8621.28 - 8626.44] voice and and that's what makes us The
[8624.44 - 8629.72] Underdogs and we all know that the
[8626.44 - 8632.56] chronically sick are always held back
[8629.72 - 8636.64] and as a always puts it we're always
[8632.56 - 8636.64] swept under the rug isn't that
[8639.80 - 8647.12] true so many people go through this life
[8644.72 - 8648.72] suffering not just
[8647.12 - 8650.68] physically
[8648.72 - 8653.12] emotionally
[8650.68 - 8656.04] spiritually and Underdog Warriors is
[8653.12 - 8660.04] there to help support those
[8656.04 - 8660.04] people now
[8661.40 - 8666.76] throughout the
[8662.68 - 8671.16] years and especially this
[8666.76 - 8674.36] year I have come through some big trials
[8671.16 - 8678.12] and a lot of that is is shaping what
[8674.36 - 8680.08] Underdog Warriors is and what it is now
[8678.12 - 8683.84] and I wish I could say more about it
[8680.08 - 8687.28] it's just it's a lot just know
[8683.84 - 8689.08] that that my heart is there and I want
[8687.28 - 8691.76] people to just feel
[8689.08 - 8694.68] supported I
[8691.76 - 8697.40] myself I stopped counting I made a list
[8694.68 - 8700.00] I had over a 100 symptoms I still have
[8697.40 - 8703.44] some symptoms but that's okay I'm in a
[8700.00 - 8705.60] much much better place now and all those
[8703.44 - 8708.44] years of suffering all those years of
[8705.60 - 8709.96] being alone all of those years without
[8708.44 - 8714.88] being
[8709.96 - 8718.44] support in the end it all just makes us
[8714.88 - 8721.16] who we do become and who we are and how
[8718.44 - 8723.60] our voice develops
[8721.16 - 8727.28] and so what I want to say
[8723.60 - 8727.28] is and just to
[8728.68 - 8733.52] emphasize Underdog Warriors is going to
[8731.84 - 8735.56] be that
[8733.52 - 8737.36] organization that helps support the
[8735.56 - 8740.56] whole Community whether it helps to
[8737.36 - 8743.64] support other organizations within the
[8740.56 - 8746.16] community and the individuals so far
[8743.64 - 8748.40] what we have done is we've
[8746.16 - 8750.80] supported uh so we go through an
[8748.40 - 8752.72] application process
[8750.80 - 8756.52] and we have we announc that through
[8752.72 - 8758.88] social media through email uh and VI and
[8756.52 - 8760.76] our website and so what we do is we go
[8758.88 - 8762.68] through this application process we
[8760.76 - 8765.52] choose the
[8762.68 - 8767.72] individuals uh that need that that may
[8765.52 - 8770.76] need supplements and quite
[8767.72 - 8772.52] honestly I would say that every single
[8770.76 - 8774.88] individual that
[8772.52 - 8778.00] applies needs
[8774.88 - 8781.16] support up until now though we have not
[8778.00 - 8784.24] been able to provide the
[8781.16 - 8785.92] supplements vimergy supplements Wyman's
[8784.24 - 8789.56] wild blueberry
[8785.92 - 8794.56] juice uh other healing tools such as
[8789.56 - 8797.48] medical medium a recommended uh what any
[8794.56 - 8800.04] other supplement or even juicers Omega
[8797.48 - 8804.32] juicers to people so we have bought all
[8800.04 - 8807.40] of these items for people
[8804.32 - 8809.72] and and here's the best part about it
[8807.40 - 8810.80] there's so much admin work we have to do
[8809.72 - 8813.20] and
[8810.80 - 8816.00] behind the scenes so many things that
[8813.20 - 8820.80] need to be done but the best part about
[8816.00 - 8824.16] it is when our recipients get those
[8820.80 - 8826.76] gifts and because they know the value of
[8824.16 - 8829.44] them and they know how much how much
[8826.76 - 8831.56] it's there to support them and their
[8829.44 - 8835.08] healing
[8831.56 - 8837.60] and and we for the most part people have
[8835.08 - 8842.16] told us that they don't
[8837.60 - 8842.16] feel that they are worthy
[8842.40 - 8848.08] of receiving what I perceive to be just
[8846.08 - 8851.40] a small
[8848.08 - 8854.12] act and and that's the whole touching
[8851.40 - 8856.36] part about it because there's a lot that
[8854.12 - 8861.36] needs to be done behind the
[8856.36 - 8864.16] scenes but I'm most grateful for those
[8861.36 - 8867.48] moments and I wanted to share that with
[8864.16 - 8871.84] you because that's what your donations
[8867.48 - 8873.88] do we promise from our Inception that
[8871.84 - 8876.68] every single dollar that would be
[8873.88 - 8879.76] donated would go right back to the
[8876.68 - 8882.92] community none of the directors up until
[8879.76 - 8884.24] this point or anyone else have received
[8882.92 - 8889.40] any
[8884.24 - 8895.12] compensation and I'm very very proud of
[8889.40 - 8898.28] [Applause]
[8895.12 - 8901.96] that it's how it was meant to be and
[8898.28 - 8904.64] it's how it will always be meant to be
[8901.96 - 8906.96] and and that's one of that that's one of
[8904.64 - 8909.96] the things that I just find the most the
[8906.96 - 8912.96] most joy in I I don't care
[8909.96 - 8915.12] about being compensated or anything like
[8912.96 - 8919.76] that I just want this organization to
[8915.12 - 8919.76] thrive and for some
[8920.96 - 8925.24] reason well it hasn't come so easily
[8923.52 - 8927.04] that's what I was just about to say
[8925.24 - 8930.56] there's a lot of hard work go going
[8927.04 - 8934.64] behind it it's for some reason reason
[8930.56 - 8938.40] God has just supported us and and the
[8934.64 - 8940.76] means have just have just come and
[8938.40 - 8942.48] everyone has reached out as I mentioned
[8940.76 - 8944.48] before we provide our recipients with
[8942.48 - 8947.92] vimergy supplements Wyman's wild
[8944.48 - 8950.00] blueberry juice we're working towards uh
[8947.92 - 8953.16] providing our recipients with the proper
[8950.00 - 8955.20] medical care that they may also need and
[8953.16 - 8957.80] we're just expanding and trying to help
[8955.20 - 8961.80] people and however we
[8957.80 - 8964.68] can and and with that we've just found
[8961.80 - 8968.20] so much support something that I never
[8964.68 - 8971.88] had before or or even felt
[8968.20 - 8974.20] supported uh my parents are here with me
[8971.88 - 8976.84] I can't say that I've
[8974.20 - 8980.16] always had the support that I've needed
[8976.84 - 8984.72] from them I know they love me but
[8980.16 - 8984.72] they've never understood what I've gone
[8986.32 - 8991.00] through and that's why I want Underdog
[8989.32 - 8995.88] Wars
[8991.00 - 8995.88] to help be a bit of that support for
[8996.83 - 9009.40] [Applause]
[9005.20 - 9012.68] others so again it's just deeply it's a
[9009.40 - 9018.20] deep deep honor to even just be standing
[9012.68 - 9018.20] here because again it wasn't something I
[9018.36 - 9022.48] expected it's just something that's
[9020.48 - 9024.20] happened just like everything else that
[9022.48 - 9028.12] has happened within the
[9024.20 - 9031.56] organization and I of course am just
[9028.12 - 9033.20] representing everyone behind it everyone

[9036.64 - 9041.08] and and to have the heavy metal detox
[9039.44 - 9043.92] smoothie and all the proceeds go to
[9041.08 - 9047.60] Underdog Warriors is just such a
[9043.92 - 9050.44] blessing again it's the support that
[9047.60 - 9053.12] wasn't expected
[9050.44 - 9055.16] and I just want to say that we are here

[9103.88 - 9109.92] need now I just want to end with a few
[9107.00 - 9113.28] things I never imagined that I would
[9109.92 - 9117.56] speak about this up here on a stage we
[9113.28 - 9121.20] ran a fundraiser at the end of the year
[9117.56 - 9122.60] so back in December and that fundraiser
[9121.20 - 9125.56] went
[9122.60 - 9129.24] beyond expected it
[9125.56 - 9131.52] was it was so incredible we had one
[9129.24 - 9135.08] donor come to us for a
[9131.52 - 9138.08] $115,000 matching donation well what
[9135.08 - 9138.08] happened
[9139.96 - 9147.08] what ended up happening was we exceeded
[9144.16 - 9150.20] our goal we had another donor that
[9147.08 - 9154.76] approached us with to to be able to
[9150.20 - 9156.80] match the 15K so he also put up some
[9154.76 - 9161.32] money you all know who you
[9156.80 - 9165.36] are um and then we received an anonymous
[9161.32 - 9165.36] donation in the mail for
[9168.48 - 9174.48] $15,000 Plus
[9171.36 - 9177.72] we made a little over $10,000 from our
[9174.48 - 9181.16] social media fundraiser our end of year
[9177.72 - 9184.12] campaign so if you add all of that up
[9181.16 - 9186.88] it's quite a large amount of
[9184.12 - 9189.20] money and we're working on Distributing
[9186.88 - 9190.96] that in the best way possible so that
[9189.20 - 9194.48] the people that do need it in our
[9190.96 - 9194.48] community do receive
[9198.36 - 9203.60] it and now we'll have the proceeds from
[9201.28 - 9207.00] the heavy metal detox smoothie

[9282.44 - 9288.80] Liz all right this now let me welcome Dr
[9286.32 - 9290.84] Prudence Hall she's been helping all
[9288.80 - 9293.08] genders from around the globe to reclaim
[9290.84 - 9295.64] their health lead a long active and
[9293.08 - 9297.72] joyful life she is a Pioneer in
[9295.64 - 9300.20] perimenopause and menopause for the last
[9297.72 - 9302.28] four decades while also treating other
[9300.20 - 9305.08] hormone conditions such as low
[9302.28 - 9307.12] testosterone in men thyroid disease
[9305.08 - 9309.72] adrenal deficiency and metabolic
[9307.12 - 9312.20] disorders instead of just treating only
[9309.72 - 9314.64] the symptoms of a patient's condition
[9312.20 - 9316.56] her approach goes to the root cause and
[9314.64 - 9319.04] balancing of the deficiencies that can
[9316.56 - 9324.20] lead to degenerative diseases later in
[9319.04 - 9326.80] life yay Dr thank you hello beloved
[9324.20 - 9329.04] followers of Anthony let's give it up
[9326.80 - 9329.04] for
[9329.52 - 9336.80] Anthony yay beloved Anthony so w how
[9333.92 - 9338.60] fitting is this that we're all here in
[9336.80 - 9341.20] the City of Angels when we have that
[9338.60 - 9344.88] angel amongst us so
[9341.20 - 9348.64] welcome medicine needs to
[9344.88 - 9350.44] change and we are that change you are
[9348.64 - 9352.72] that change
[9350.44 - 9355.48] because the era has changed in medicine
[9352.72 - 9358.64] over the last 30 years the way we
[9355.48 - 9362.56] practice medicine must change we need to
[9358.64 - 9367.12] get to the core or the root causes of
[9362.56 - 9369.92] Aging now what are those number one
[9367.12 - 9372.64] toxicity who what is Anthony doing he's
[9369.92 - 9376.12] going to detox the entire world and I
[9372.64 - 9379.36] certainly follow his detox number two
[9376.12 - 9382.28] imbalanced hormones hormones are our
[9379.36 - 9385.88] body body software and when men reach
[9382.28 - 9387.76] about 50 or 45 their testosterone tanks
[9385.88 - 9389.64] and oh my God they become irritable they
[9387.76 - 9393.08] get belly fat they develop heart disease
[9389.64 - 9395.76] and all kinds of things so women start
[9393.08 - 9398.56] to go into per menopause in their late
[9395.76 - 9401.44] 30s and that's really a problem because
[9398.56 - 9404.76] when our hormones decrease up go the
[9401.44 - 9406.56] core root causes of diseases so the core
[9404.76 - 9409.08] root causes are balance your hormones
[9406.56 - 9410.64] you know imbalanced hormones toxicity
[9409.08 - 9413.68] inflam
[9410.64 - 9416.12] and stress when you have those four
[9413.68 - 9420.44] components present in your
[9416.12 - 9422.40] body diseases arise we feel terrible I
[9420.44 - 9424.84] take care of so many patients who can't
[9422.40 - 9426.28] get out of bed yeah they'll get out of
[9424.84 - 9429.12] bed get their kids off to school but
[9426.28 - 9432.00] then they go right back to bed so if we
[9429.12 - 9433.36] address those core root causes what do
[9432.00 - 9437.56] we have
[9433.36 - 9439.68] Vitality energy good sleep we age
[9437.56 - 9442.44] beautifully with beautiful skin and
[9439.68 - 9445.56] bones and hair and we don't develop the
[9442.44 - 9447.04] diseases like cancer heart disease the
[9445.56 - 9449.92] number one cause of death in women and
[9447.04 - 9451.72] men we don't develop all the autoimmune
[9449.92 - 9454.68] diseases that Anthony has also talked
[9451.72 - 9456.96] about nor do we develop the diseases of
[9454.68 - 9460.44] inflammation you know all the arthriti
[9456.96 - 9465.48] and the body pain that we have
[9460.44 - 9468.16] so medicine needs to address who we are
[9465.48 - 9470.92] and first of all we're Spiritual Beings
[9468.16 - 9472.84] we come from source we're also emotional
[9470.92 - 9476.40] beings especially the women that I work
[9472.84 - 9479.36] with we're emotional and our thoughts
[9476.40 - 9481.92] create our emotions create our reality
[9479.36 - 9483.72] and our health so when we can change our
[9481.92 - 9484.76] thoughts the emotions change and our
[9483.72 - 9486.44] reality
[9484.76 - 9489.44] changes
[9486.44 - 9493.72] also what I've learned over the last 40
[9489.44 - 9495.80] years of practice is that medicine as we
[9493.72 - 9499.12] practice it in the western world is
[9495.80 - 9500.12] about 80 years old when was Penicillin
[9499.12 - 9504.16] invented
[9500.12 - 9508.00] 1928 when was the first patient treated
[9504.16 - 9510.44] 1945 so how can we as doctors and as
[9508.00 - 9513.08] practitioners in Western medicine come
[9510.44 - 9515.32] on with this arrogance I know what to do
[9513.08 - 9517.00] you you be quiet I know the answer so
[9515.32 - 9520.88] this is not the
[9517.00 - 9522.92] way we need humility and we need
[9520.88 - 9525.24] partnership with our
[9522.92 - 9527.08] patients I can't approach a patient
[9525.24 - 9529.72] without knowing what his goals are or
[9527.08 - 9532.88] her goals are and I want to know know
[9529.72 - 9535.00] what's important to you how do you want
[9532.88 - 9539.80] to address your health
[9535.00 - 9544.84] concerns so arrogance has got to stop we
[9539.80 - 9548.92] need to really age in a way where we are
[9544.84 - 9551.52] increasing our biological wellness we
[9548.92 - 9554.08] can't create a different chronological
[9551.52 - 9557.32] age I'll always be this age but in terms
[9554.08 - 9560.92] of biologically addressing all those
[9557.32 - 9563.08] core root causes we can create Miracles
[9560.92 - 9566.28] so our biological age is sometimes 30
[9563.08 - 9568.80] years older or 30 years younger so what
[9566.28 - 9570.60] goes into creating better biology
[9568.80 - 9574.72] balancing your hormones getting rid of
[9570.60 - 9574.72] inflammation decreasing stress the core
[9575.24 - 9580.52] causes one of the pearls I've learned in
[9577.64 - 9584.04] medicine is that and I've done this for
[9580.52 - 9586.88] for almost 40 years is that when you
[9584.04 - 9590.60] balance your hormones back to youthful
[9586.88 - 9592.92] levels or preserve your hormones
[9590.60 - 9595.08] diseases just fall away now what are
[9592.92 - 9597.36] some of the symptoms of women who are
[9595.08 - 9600.84] going through menopause oh we sweat we
[9597.36 - 9603.48] can't sleep we're Moody we're crying
[9600.84 - 9606.52] angry I think some of you know it many
[9603.48 - 9609.04] of you are my patients and we don't need
[9606.52 - 9611.68] to live that way because once you go
[9609.04 - 9614.88] into menopause you stay that way your
[9611.68 - 9617.80] whole life so what do we want to do we
[9614.88 - 9620.60] want to prevent the decline of our
[9617.80 - 9624.32] ovaries and of our thyroid and of our
[9620.60 - 9628.72] adrenal glands and detoxification is
[9624.32 - 9632.04] essential we're so toxic they we've done
[9628.72 - 9634.32] uh W I would say rather Innovative
[9632.04 - 9637.48] people in medicine have done biopsies of
[9634.32 - 9640.68] muscle to see how toxic we are and every
[9637.48 - 9643.40] single one of us is filled with toxicity
[9640.68 - 9645.00] does Western Medicine address that even
[9643.40 - 9648.08] with one
[9645.00 - 9650.00] suggestion in our arrogance we don't but
[9648.08 - 9652.64] Anthony is doing that and he's done it
[9650.00 - 9654.36] successfully for many many years and as
[9652.64 - 9657.44] I deal with patients and put them on the
[9654.36 - 9660.64] detox diet his diet and work with them I
[9657.44 - 9662.44] see real Miracles occur so balance your
[9660.64 - 9664.64] hormones back to youthful levels and
[9662.44 - 9668.24] prevent the decline by
[9664.64 - 9670.40] detoxifying now people think very
[9668.24 - 9672.40] frequently that we develop diseases due
[9670.40 - 9677.84] to our
[9672.40 - 9679.72] genes not true guys 90% of diseases come
[9677.84 - 9681.84] from lifestyle
[9679.72 - 9683.72] so what do we need to do we need to
[9681.84 - 9685.32] sleep eight hours eat that great diet
[9683.72 - 9689.60] that Anthony talks about and that I talk
[9685.32 - 9692.36] about we need to uh get some exercise
[9689.60 - 9696.04] think good thoughts meditate decrease
[9692.36 - 9699.52] our stress so when we do these things
[9696.04 - 9702.60] Miracles can occur we don't need to go
[9699.52 - 9705.28] downhill we don't need to have a decline
[9702.60 - 9707.96] in our hormones so our thyroid gland I
[9705.28 - 9709.88] actually wrote the forward to anon's uh
[9707.96 - 9712.84] medical medium book
[9709.88 - 9717.00] and yeah it was it was a real eye opener
[9712.84 - 9720.04] for me uh so when we uh balance our
[9717.00 - 9721.60] thyroid hormones by detoxification I
[9720.04 - 9724.60] would say the number one cause is as
[9721.60 - 9726.92] Anthony says it's it's viruses and also
[9724.60 - 9729.56] toxicity that cause our glands and our
[9726.92 - 9733.84] hormones to decline so what happens when
[9729.56 - 9736.36] we lose our thyroid well we get tired we
[9733.84 - 9738.76] gain 20 30 pounds the brain is foggy we
[9736.36 - 9741.44] get sad we cry and what does Western
[9738.76 - 9746.48] medicine do well first of all they
[9741.44 - 9749.00] ignore and Miss 40% of low thyroid
[9746.48 - 9750.96] conditions I come on 40% of us are
[9749.00 - 9751.96] walking around with low thyroid and
[9750.96 - 9754.96] we're given
[9751.96 - 9757.88] anti-depressants we're given uh you know
[9754.96 - 9760.52] adol to make the brain work better so
[9757.88 - 9763.20] these are incorrect
[9760.52 - 9766.04] Solutions we can't keep on practicing
[9763.20 - 9768.72] medicine this way so the thyroid gland
[9766.04 - 9770.28] is important the adrenal glands are very
[9768.72 - 9772.12] important and I work a lot with my
[9770.28 - 9774.92] patients on that they little glands that
[9772.12 - 9777.88] sit right back on the kidneys and when
[9774.92 - 9780.24] we have stress you know stress kills
[9777.88 - 9782.84] stress causes diseases then what happens
[9780.24 - 9787.20] is those hormones soar they go really
[9782.84 - 9787.96] high and then slowly they tank and when
[9787.20 - 9791.48] they
[9787.96 - 9793.84] tank all the symptoms of fatigue and
[9791.48 - 9795.96] anger and irritability and lots of
[9793.84 - 9798.28] weight gain start to
[9795.96 - 9800.24] arise so if you have one hormone
[9798.28 - 9802.44] abnormality okay okay well we can maybe
[9800.24 - 9804.92] deal with the two hormone abnormalities
[9802.44 - 9807.16] not so good three hormone abnormalities
[9804.92 - 9811.44] were tank plus you throw in a virus like
[9807.16 - 9813.36] Cy omegal virus or Epstein bar and we're
[9811.44 - 9815.84] just we're
[9813.36 - 9817.64] dying so we want to maintain our
[9815.84 - 9820.40] hormonal balance now I want to tell you
[9817.64 - 9823.08] how I met Anthony because I think it is
[9820.40 - 9825.68] such a touching story a patient came in
[9823.08 - 9828.72] and she said Prudence I have a gift for
[9825.68 - 9831.40] you and it's like you do I'm a little
[9828.72 - 9833.36] shy receiving giest but oh thank you and
[9831.40 - 9835.44] she slapped that medical medium book
[9833.36 - 9838.00] right in my hand I looked at I thought
[9835.44 - 9841.52] medical medium ah there's a long
[9838.00 - 9844.08] tradition in Western and Eastern uh
[9841.52 - 9846.36] medicine of having people who see the
[9844.08 - 9848.84] truth and who know for example the
[9846.36 - 9851.56] medicine men directly in contact with
[9848.84 - 9853.72] God and they helped the tribes it it
[9851.56 - 9855.08] goes back thousands of years so medical
[9853.72 - 9857.64] medium oh my goodness this is
[9855.08 - 9860.24] interesting so I got home and I was
[9857.64 - 9863.40] really so first of all I was interested
[9860.24 - 9865.88] because I know that there's lots of
[9863.40 - 9867.68] different ways to obtain information and
[9865.88 - 9869.28] it's probably not from the double blind
[9867.68 - 9871.00] studies I mean that's important but it's
[9869.28 - 9872.56] also from other media so I got home
[9871.00 - 9875.08] looked through the book and I thought
[9872.56 - 9878.72] this is very interesting and I turned
[9875.08 - 9882.12] the book over and there was a uh a
[9878.72 - 9884.20] little um I would say it was sort of a a
[9882.12 - 9888.04] tribute to Anthony from one of my dear
[9884.20 - 9891.04] friends Alejandra anger he's Dr
[9888.04 - 9892.16] clean re resets the gut and he's a dear
[9891.04 - 9895.28] friend and I called him up I said
[9892.16 - 9899.44] Alejandro who's this medical medium and
[9895.28 - 9902.12] he said oh Prudence he is the
[9899.44 - 9905.76] best he knows how to really help your
[9902.12 - 9908.24] patients and about three hours later I
[9905.76 - 9911.00] got a call hello this is Anthony and I'm
[9908.24 - 9912.32] going like Anthony Anthony Anthony it's
[9911.00 - 9917.00] like
[9912.32 - 9917.00] Anthony are are are you Anthony

[9920.04 - 9926.36] sweetest relationship enormous knowledge
[9923.48 - 9929.04] that has been passed on to me and I'm

[13705.24 - 13708.84] resistance right I want to eat healthier
[13707.48 - 13710.48] I want to take care of myself I want to
[13708.84 - 13711.92] do this I want to drink the celery juice
[13710.48 - 13713.24] and then there's people around you or
[13711.92 - 13715.04] people that you bump into that are like
[13713.24 - 13717.24] don't do that don't do
[13715.04 - 13718.24] that that's a whole another struggle all
[13717.24 - 13720.68] on its
[13718.24 - 13726.00] own and then there's the inner inner
[13720.68 - 13726.00] inner struggle the inner struggle of
[13727.08 - 13730.84] is anybody listening to me is anybody
[13728.92 - 13732.48] hearing me do they understand me how
[13730.84 - 13734.32] come they're misunderstanding me how
[13732.48 - 13736.80] come they're judging me right how many
[13734.32 - 13739.56] people go through
[13736.80 - 13741.32] that when we're indestructible and
[13739.56 - 13742.13] everything's fine and we feel good and
[13741.32 - 13743.32] we're walking
[13742.13 - 13745.68] [Music]
[13743.32 - 13748.40] along you're on the beach for two hours
[13745.68 - 13750.12] on 100 degree day no big deal you're
[13748.40 - 13752.28] working out that morning 5 in the
[13750.12 - 13756.04] morning for an hour or two you're in the
[13752.28 - 13758.20] gym everything's great
[13756.04 - 13763.12] the world is your
[13758.20 - 13765.64] oyster and then you get sick boom and
[13763.12 - 13769.16] then the real fight the real struggle
[13765.64 - 13770.80] happens I know people they work hard
[13769.16 - 13773.32] every day to achieve
[13770.80 - 13775.04] things and they do things every day but
[13773.32 - 13776.72] when you're sick and you're chronically
[13775.04 - 13779.24] strug struggling and suffering it's
[13776.72 - 13780.40] another story it's a battle no one
[13779.24 - 13783.68] understands out there unless they've
[13780.40 - 13785.72] been there before you can't compare it
[13783.68 - 13787.20] you can't I to a friend and they're like
[13785.72 - 13790.24] yeah I'm working out in the gym I'm in
[13787.20 - 13791.96] there for 2 hours a day you wouldn't
[13790.24 - 13792.84] believe how hard it is aw I'm like
[13791.96 - 13795.84] that's
[13792.84 - 13797.68] nothing nothing compared to can't get
[13795.84 - 13799.00] out of bed can't feed my kids can't take
[13797.68 - 13801.84] care of my kids can't drive them to
[13799.00 - 13805.36] school can't go do this can't do
[13801.84 - 13807.04] that that struggle and then the struggle
[13805.36 - 13809.12] of no one understanding because they're
[13807.04 - 13810.44] not there with you because they don't
[13809.12 - 13812.00] know what it's like sure we have
[13810.44 - 13814.40] relatives around us and friends and
[13812.00 - 13816.12] family that that they they connect we we
[13814.40 - 13817.12] have that many people have that many
[13816.12 - 13821.16] people
[13817.12 - 13823.24] don't many times it's just I'm alone in
[13821.16 - 13824.96] this and then you see people they seem
[13823.24 - 13826.84] fine you you see them driving down the
[13824.96 - 13828.84] road everybody seems healthy everybody
[13826.84 - 13830.12] seems perfect how about that everybody's
[13828.84 - 13831.28] enjoying their lives and living their
[13830.12 - 13832.76] lives and they look healthy and they
[13831.28 - 13834.56] look great you see them driving down the
[13832.76 - 13836.04] road all day long like this that
[13834.56 - 13838.96] person's living it up that person's
[13836.04 - 13842.56] living it up and you're
[13838.96 - 13844.04] struggling it's all it's all difficult
[13842.56 - 13847.44] and it's what I call rising out of the
[13844.04 - 13850.26] ashes cuz when you come back from that
[13847.44 - 13852.08] that's gold medal
[13850.26 - 13853.64] [Applause]
[13852.08 - 13857.40] stuff
[13853.64 - 13859.76] I I talk to a lot of Olympic athletes
[13857.40 - 13861.48] the ones that get sick for the first
[13859.76 - 13862.80] time in their life they're working out
[13861.48 - 13864.92] every day they're doing their thing they
[13862.80 - 13866.24] got their trainers they got their agents
[13864.92 - 13868.28] they got their publicists they got
[13866.24 - 13869.56] everybody they're doing it all day long
[13868.28 - 13870.92] then they get into the Olympics they're
[13869.56 - 13873.04] doing it doing they get a silver medal
[13870.92 - 13876.12] gold medal bronze medal and then they
[13873.04 - 13878.88] get sick
[13876.12 - 13880.84] and then they say Anthony
[13878.88 - 13884.20] aw I didn't
[13880.84 - 13886.56] know I had it made I got up in the
[13884.20 - 13889.32] morning made my protein shake did my
[13886.56 - 13891.76] workout trained all day had my trainer
[13889.32 - 13893.88] with me went to bed cuz I was tired
[13891.76 - 13897.12] started the next day over but that was a
[13893.88 - 13898.88] joke compared to being sick and
[13897.12 - 13902.56] something being
[13898.88 - 13905.44] wrong and I talk to Olympic athletes
[13902.56 - 13907.84] that aren't sick yet
[13905.44 - 13910.04] and I say I get it I know what you
[13907.84 - 13913.20] achieved it's amazing I'm proud of you
[13910.04 - 13914.40] but it's nothing compared to being sick
[13913.20 - 13917.40] and
[13914.40 - 13919.60] bedridden stuck in a wheelchair not
[13917.40 - 13922.80] knowing what's wrong legs don't work
[13919.60 - 13925.56] arms don't work something's off battery
[13922.80 - 13927.72] of tests how many people went to so many
[13925.56 - 13929.44] doctors which we have to have doctors we
[13927.72 - 13932.20] need them but how many people went to so
[13929.44 - 13936.32] many doctors had a battery of tests have
[13932.20 - 13936.32] been through it all right
[13937.56 - 13941.16] this
[13938.84 - 13943.96] is an achievement you got to patch
[13941.16 - 13945.48] yourself on the back you truly do and
[13943.96 - 13948.04] maybe your symptoms are mild maybe
[13945.48 - 13950.64] they're severe but either way and then
[13948.04 - 13952.80] it's how we feel about it some people
[13950.64 - 13956.04] I've seen people they're struggling so
[13952.80 - 13957.08] heavily they're so sick they've been
[13956.04 - 13961.68] through so

[13967.88 - 13972.20] complaining they're just pushing through
[13970.68 - 13973.96] and then you see people out there that
[13972.20 - 13976.16] aren't sick yet and they're nasty

[13981.40 - 13985.36] ungrateful they take everything for
[13983.56 - 13987.44] granted not

[14356.28 - 14362.80] unbelievable most importantly no matter
[14358.88 - 14367.92] what the tools are in there for you

[14378.12 - 14384.76] other in a lifetime
[14380.76 - 14386.88] before right were we here
[14384.76 - 14388.60] but years and hundreds of years ago did
[14386.88 - 14390.84] we do
[14388.60 - 14393.04] this some of you guys are really old
[14390.84 - 14394.56] souls and I said it before way older
[14393.04 - 14395.92] than me just because Spirit of
[14394.56 - 14398.80] compassion spoke to me at age four
[14395.92 - 14402.68] doesn't mean I had the oldest Soul trust
[14398.80 - 14405.00] me I try my best but some of you people
[14402.68 - 14407.00] got the oldest souls and many of you
[14405.00 - 14410.40] people were born into this world with no
[14407.00 - 14413.12] ego at all at all it's
[14410.40 - 14414.96] incredible I mean true salt of the earth
[14413.12 - 14416.72] the real expression of salt of the earth
[14414.96 - 14418.84] is in the medical medium community and
[14416.72 - 14421.40] that blows my mind every single day
[14418.84 - 14421.40] every single
[14422.00 - 14428.72] day and when I think about it I'm just
[14425.68 - 14430.44] get overwhelmed with joy sadness too
[14428.72 - 14432.76] sadness too I know you guys have
[14430.44 - 14436.40] suffered and struggled you come a long
[14432.76 - 14440.92] long way and it's not like you get an

[14456.64 - 14463.16] it and you keep on moving
[14458.60 - 14463.16] forward takes guts man it takes
[14464.00 - 14468.00] guts and then there's the compassion
[14466.40 - 14469.76] right I've worked hard to try to get
[14468.00 - 14471.08] some compassion going just because I
[14469.76 - 14472.48] talk to Spirit of compassion doesn't
[14471.08 - 14474.56] mean I'm the most compassionate person
[14472.48 - 14476.20] when I was younger I told of compassion
[14474.56 - 14477.84] I don't want to do this I was 10 years
[14476.20 - 14481.44] old saying I don't care about people
[14477.84 - 14481.44] being sick I want to ride my
[14481.68 - 14485.80] bicycle but spirit said no no no you
[14484.08 - 14488.28] have to care and never forget you need
[14485.80 - 14490.12] to be here for people you have to care
[14488.28 - 14491.68] it's critical and I said okay I will
[14490.12 - 14494.00] make it a point that I always care from
[14491.68 - 14494.00] here on
[14495.41 - 14500.39] [Applause]
[14502.12 - 14507.60] out I I hear that word compassion out
[14505.56 - 14509.08] there and the first thing I think about
[14507.60 - 14511.16] is the medical medium Community being
[14509.08 - 14512.72] the most compassionate people out there
[14511.16 - 14514.28] that's the first thing I think I hear
[14512.72 - 14516.36] somebody say the word compassion out
[14514.28 - 14517.84] there and I instantly go right to the
[14516.36 - 14519.32] medical medium community in my mind and
[14517.84 - 14521.04] said no no no no no no the most
[14519.32 - 14522.64] compassionate people there are on this
[14521.04 - 14525.76] planet is the medical medium Community I
[14522.64 - 14525.76] don't want anybody to forget
[14526.36 - 14530.24] that don't ever doubt yourself and think
[14528.84 - 14531.60] you're not don't ever doubt yourself to
[14530.24 - 14533.92] think you're a bad person you're not a
[14531.60 - 14535.08] bad person always remember that so one
[14533.92 - 14537.36] thing that Spirit of compassion always
[14535.08 - 14539.16] told me at the beginning is you tell
[14537.36 - 14541.20] someone who's going through this and
[14539.16 - 14543.64] moving forward that you didn't do
[14541.20 - 14545.80] anything wrong and it's not your fault
[14543.64 - 14547.20] it's not your fault do not forget that
[14545.80 - 14549.04] you make sure you have it in the heart
[14547.20 - 14550.96] is if you think it's your fault and
[14549.04 - 14553.56] you're the problem and you caused it and
[14550.96 - 14555.60] you're a bad person we are not in a good
[14553.56 - 14558.20] place you have to understand that has to
[14555.60 - 14558.20] be fixed
[14561.48 - 14565.20] immediately every morning you wake up
[14563.44 - 14566.72] you say no I'm a good person I didn't
[14565.20 - 14568.28] get sick because I'm a bad person I
[14566.72 - 14570.32] didn't create this and I didn't cause it
[14568.28 - 14572.64] and guess what my body is not destroying
[14570.32 - 14574.28] itself my body is not attacking itself I
[14572.64 - 14576.12] got diagnosed with autoimmune and they
[14574.28 - 14578.36] told me my body is destroying itself no
[14576.12 - 14578.36] it's
[14579.08 - 14583.60] not always
[14581.24 - 14586.16] remember your body's fighting for you
[14583.60 - 14587.56] every day every single day it's working
[14586.16 - 14589.56] for you if you got a symptom and it
[14587.56 - 14591.76] won't go away your body's still working
[14589.56 - 14593.40] really hard every minute every day it's
[14591.76 - 14594.60] working hard for you you have to know
[14593.40 - 14596.08] that you have to know it in your heart
[14594.60 - 14599.16] and in your mind your head your soul

[14621.52 - 14625.68] saying most important thing to know is
[14623.92 - 14628.40] here I'm going to tell you you did not
[14625.68 - 14631.44] create your illness you did not create
[14628.40 - 14633.24] it and it wasn't because in a lifetime
[14631.44 - 14635.32] before this you were a bad person and
[14633.24 - 14637.96] had your head chopped off in England or
[14635.32 - 14641.88] in someplace
[14637.96 - 14643.44] else or 500 years ago so you were I
[14641.88 - 14646.32] don't know burned at the stake because
[14643.44 - 14646.32] you were a terrible
[14646.80 - 14652.88] person you did not create your
[14649.92 - 14654.24] illness okay and it's not your fault
[14652.88 - 14656.32] there's happen
[14654.24 - 14659.24] there are certain circumstances that we
[14656.32 - 14661.88] run into trouble with here on this
[14659.24 - 14664.24] planet cuz this planet as we know is not
[14661.88 - 14666.48] a fair place you tell you tell me if
[14664.24 - 14670.04] this planet's a fair
[14666.48 - 14672.48] place it's a beautiful place sure it's
[14670.04 - 14674.12] not always the fairest place so it's not
[14672.48 - 14676.32] our fault when we get sick or something
[14674.12 - 14678.48] happens or we get exposure or we get
[14676.32 - 14681.16] something in us that we it just we
[14678.48 - 14683.28] didn't do it to ourselves it happened
[14681.16 - 14685.48] for a lot of reasons even if we think we
[14683.28 - 14687.48] did it to to ourself it's not true
[14685.48 - 14690.60] something happened emotionally something
[14687.48 - 14693.32] happened me mentally some kind of wounds
[14690.60 - 14695.04] from the past that aren't your fault can
[14693.32 - 14697.72] also get in the way but that's not you
[14695.04 - 14700.72] creating it those are
[14697.72 - 14704.24] injuries
[14700.72 - 14708.32] right but keep in mind that no matter
[14704.24 - 14711.32] what okay have compassion for yourselves
[14708.32 - 14714.64] every day don't kick yourself in the ass
[14711.32 - 14718.12] whatever you do don't do that
[14714.64 - 14721.16] and if you fall off course or fall off
[14718.12 - 14723.48] the wagon and you eat something that's
[14721.16 - 14725.60] not helping you and you drink something
[14723.48 - 14728.12] that's not helping you that's okay
[14725.60 - 14730.52] that's okay it happens to the best of us
[14728.12 - 14732.92] because this is a hard place to live in
[14730.52 - 14734.68] this world and I understand if we trip
[14732.92 - 14736.72] and fall a little bit and we eat
[14734.68 - 14738.60] something and drink something and we do
[14736.72 - 14742.08] something like Dr NES he drinks alcohol
[14738.60 - 14742.08] every single day
[14746.96 - 14753.88] yeah and Dr Joby who sells $53,000

[14766.88 - 14773.12] it's okay we can get back on the horse
[14770.20 - 14774.12] when we can we can customize stuff for
[14773.12 - 14776.68] ourselves

[15185.48 - 15190.48] it I was I was like no I'm ready to do
[15188.32 - 15192.08] it I'm ready to do this right after more
[15190.48 - 15194.92] than 20 years of being an internal
[15192.08 - 15197.52] medicine doctor after starting my
[15194.92 - 15200.44] medical beating journey in 2015 when the
[15197.52 - 15203.24] new book I the first book came out after
[15200.44 - 15205.44] speaking to thousands and thousands of
[15203.24 - 15207.52] patients about the medical meet and
[15205.44 - 15211.28] protocols I was like I'm going to fly
[15207.52 - 15215.52] from Spring Texas to California and give
[15211.28 - 15218.00] him the best shot I can give so you know
[15215.52 - 15220.20] of course I I don't want to like be too
[15218.00 - 15224.28] groupy so I was like when they asked me
[15220.20 - 15228.36] I was like yeah sure I can do it right
[15224.28 - 15231.60] so um imagine Anthony William right the
[15228.36 - 15235.52] this healer Global healer to millions of
[15231.60 - 15237.88] people many bestsellers you're Idol um
[15235.52 - 15239.28] again I look up to Anthony because when
[15237.88 - 15241.84] you're my height you have to look up to
[15239.28 - 15244.28] everybody and it was an honor it's like
[15241.84 - 15246.60] it's like the peak moment right like
[15244.28 - 15249.48] after let's say after getting to medical
[15246.60 - 15252.12] school after marrying my high school s
[15249.48 - 15253.96] sweetheart after having two sexually
[15252.12 - 15256.04] transmitted dependent
[15253.96 - 15258.36] uh this was this is one of the best
[15256.04 - 15259.52] things I could imagine so I thank all
[15258.36 - 15262.96] you guys for coming out here and
[15259.52 - 15266.96] supporting me and Anthony you basically
[15262.96 - 15269.20] right um but immediately after accepting
[15266.96 - 15270.28] it I was like mini panic attack mode I
[15269.20 - 15273.60] was like what the heck am I going to
[15270.28 - 15276.88] speak about um you know I got material
[15273.60 - 15280.56] on YouTube and MD you know Instagram I'm
[15276.88 - 15283.72] MB was Spirit MD WIS
[15280.56 - 15286.52] PT um sham plug there
[15283.72 - 15289.32] uh I thought well you know I got to
[15286.52 - 15291.24] relax what would people around me want
[15289.32 - 15294.00] to hear what what could make them what
[15291.24 - 15295.84] would my make my wife laugh right then I
[15294.00 - 15297.44] thought no no no no no no I can't get
[15295.84 - 15299.20] naked in front of the audience that
[15297.44 - 15303.24] would be Pro totally inappropriate and
[15299.20 - 15304.52] maybe final by law so I thought about it
[15303.24 - 15305.84] again and I thought you know I just I'll
[15304.52 - 15309.96] just talk
[15305.84 - 15313.72] about why why your medical medium
[15309.96 - 15316.20] healing story is more important than any
[15313.72 - 15319.80] medical journal article or scientific
[15316.20 - 15322.64] study right and how do you talk about
[15319.80 - 15324.84] medical medium to other people and

[15514.36 - 15519.00] [Applause]
[15516.64 - 15522.00] Applause one of the most common
[15519.00 - 15525.24] questions I get as a medical doctor is
[15522.00 - 15526.92] how can you recile Medical Science with
[15525.24 - 15529.60] a guy who hears a voice in his head and
[15526.92 - 15531.64] he's not even a doctor so I say to you
[15529.60 - 15534.04] well like many of you I've explored
[15531.64 - 15535.84] these alternative treatments I've I've
[15534.04 - 15538.44] spent a lot of money I spent a lot of
[15535.84 - 15540.00] time and you know what Anthony said
[15538.44 - 15541.20] about oh somebody's telling you that you
[15540.00 - 15543.64] died in past life and somebody chopped
[15541.20 - 15544.88] your head off that was us and I was like
[15543.64 - 15546.84] how did you know that I never told him
[15544.88 - 15548.32] that how did you know that they told me
[15546.84 - 15549.92] that because of the law of attraction
[15548.32 - 15552.16] that I attracted to a family member of
[15549.92 - 15554.64] mine I'm like how did I attract this
[15552.16 - 15557.36] crap to my family I don't understand
[15554.64 - 15559.76] that so whatever Anthony says I mean I
[15557.36 - 15561.16] learned from Anthony like The Compassion
[15559.76 - 15563.32] that he feels for people he feels what
[15561.16 - 15564.60] they have and I had a little glimpse of
[15563.32 - 15567.52] that through through his writings and
[15564.60 - 15569.48] his lives so I very much thank you for
[15567.52 - 15570.96] that um you know many of these doctors
[15569.48 - 15572.80] are and practitioners they're not bad
[15570.96 - 15574.04] people they have a belief system you
[15572.80 - 15576.72] can't I can't fault them for trying to
[15574.04 - 15578.40] earn a living I can't uh fault them for
[15576.72 - 15580.52] not knowing the right
[15578.40 - 15582.24] information um and I was immediately
[15580.52 - 15584.40] drawn to Anthony after the first Hay
[15582.24 - 15586.20] House Radio podcast you guys remember
[15584.40 - 15587.68] that stuff he get on the phone and you
[15586.20 - 15588.64] talk to people like oh my God this guy
[15587.68 - 15590.40] know what he's talking about how does he
[15588.64 - 15592.68] know this stuff he's not even a doctor
[15590.40 - 15596.04] it's amazing so I was really intrigued
[15592.68 - 15597.76] by that and and um you know I I
[15596.04 - 15599.68] Implement some of this stuff you know a
[15597.76 - 15601.56] little celery juice here get off gluten
[15599.68 - 15603.44] dairy eggs and people feel great I I
[15601.56 - 15605.20] look like a genius you know I tell my
[15603.44 - 15608.48] patients like you need to adrenally
[15605.20 - 15610.72] snack so you can calorically stack so
[15608.48 - 15613.08] that the sugar doesn't go whack and
[15610.72 - 15615.64] viruses attack
[15613.08 - 15618.24] and and hopefully they they learned that
[15615.64 - 15621.28] um but like for instance there was one
[15618.24 - 15623.24] one 36-year-old woman she was I think it
[15621.28 - 15624.12] was like four rounds of IVF over eight
[15623.24 - 15625.84] years or something like this I can't
[15624.12 - 15629.12] remember the details now because I'm on
[15625.84 - 15630.36] stage and I met her for the first time I
[15629.12 - 15632.56] didn't even change her th do of
[15630.36 - 15634.80] medication I told her start some celery
[15632.56 - 15638.12] juice get off the Troublemaker foods and
[15634.80 - 15640.60] guess what a few months later prar right
[15638.12 - 15643.16] she was pregnant thank Dr fan thank you
[15640.60 - 15645.32] for getting me pregnant I'm like don't
[15643.16 - 15647.80] say that you're you're going to get my
[15645.32 - 15649.40] medical license revoked but we have
[15647.80 - 15650.76] countless stores like this right I mean
[15649.40 - 15652.08] not everybody does medical mean people
[15650.76 - 15653.56] come my to my office and they're like
[15652.08 - 15655.64] eating barbecue and they're not going to
[15653.56 - 15657.44] do this stuff but at least I try and I
[15655.64 - 15660.28] sleep better knowing that I've tried for
[15657.44 - 15662.48] them and for my own conscious
[15660.28 - 15665.12] so
[15662.48 - 15667.48] um you don't need to spend thousands of
[15665.12 - 15668.88] dollars on these these tests right you
[15667.48 - 15670.32] know there's something called um in
[15668.88 - 15672.76] clinical practice called weighing the
[15670.32 - 15675.28] risks versus the benefits of something
[15672.76 - 15677.08] so for instance penicillin penicillin
[15675.28 - 15678.00] can help you clear an infection right
[15677.08 - 15680.08] like you've got infection you might
[15678.00 - 15682.68] stepsis you might die it can save you
[15680.08 - 15685.12] but also you can get
[15682.68 - 15688.56] anaphylaxis so you always weigh the risk
[15685.12 - 15690.40] benefits of a treatment modality celery
[15688.56 - 15693.52] juice what are the risk benefit ratios
[15690.40 - 15695.84] of celery juice I got to go wash the
[15693.52 - 15697.24] celery I got to cut the celery I got to
[15695.84 - 15700.24] poop in my
[15697.24 - 15701.60] pants but it also clears the skin it
[15700.24 - 15703.08] helps the liver it helps the blood
[15701.60 - 15705.96] pressure go down I know had a miracle
[15703.08 - 15707.52] with blood pressure in my family so
[15705.96 - 15709.16] that's it's important to weigh the risk
[15707.52 - 15709.92] benefit ratio of a certain modality when
[15709.16 - 15712.04] you're talking about foods and
[15709.92 - 15714.48] supplements I mean not a lot of side
[15712.04 - 15716.12] effects uh that you can tell about right
[15714.48 - 15718.08] um but some everybody's sensitive so
[15716.12 - 15719.60] there there's that to consider right
[15718.08 - 15722.88] let's talk about exercise compared you
[15719.60 - 15726.28] know risk management Dr fan when I
[15722.88 - 15728.64] exercise I get wet on my skin and my
[15726.28 - 15730.52] heart goes nuts and I get adrenaline R
[15728.64 - 15731.92] so I can't exercise at all I'm like no
[15730.52 - 15733.28] exercise is good for you long term if
[15731.92 - 15735.08] you can if if you can do it if you don't
[15733.28 - 15736.76] renally stress yourself so you always
[15735.08 - 15738.72] have to think about the the risk that's
[15736.76 - 15740.80] how you say look look the doctor's going
[15738.72 - 15743.16] to put you on medication or you can eat
[15740.80 - 15745.16] better and you can add some celery juice
[15743.16 - 15748.76] which one do you want to
[15745.16 - 15751.08] do um but then a loved one says well
[15748.76 - 15753.48] where is the scientific evidence for
[15751.08 - 15755.96] this medical medium right after all mom
[15753.48 - 15759.08] you the one who is recommending this
[15755.96 - 15762.04] crystal energy infused enema or this
[15759.08 - 15764.20] homeopathic feces and and that didn't
[15762.04 - 15765.80] help your microbiome right you've seen
[15764.20 - 15767.32] that you're seen your mom or dad like
[15765.80 - 15768.76] they doing these crazy stuff right they
[15767.32 - 15772.72] find medical meeting all of a sudden
[15768.76 - 15775.32] this is the thing well you don't need uh
[15772.72 - 15777.04] a randomized clinical trial to tell you
[15775.32 - 15779.64] that you shouldn't go play with wild
[15777.04 - 15781.68] bears okay it's kind of like no no no
[15779.64 - 15783.64] our study shows that only less than 1%
[15781.68 - 15785.88] of these participants did not get their
[15783.64 - 15788.20] arm ripped off but you don't need to
[15785.88 - 15792.60] know not to go play in traffic that you
[15788.20 - 15794.20] know a study to tell you that so um
[15792.60 - 15796.60] our you
[15794.20 - 15798.52] know I'll tell you that as a fourth year
[15796.60 - 15800.60] medical student when I was doing helping
[15798.52 - 15801.96] uh doing research for a paper this poor
[15800.60 - 15804.08] faculty Professor he was just trying to
[15801.96 - 15806.32] publish so he could stay keep his job
[15804.08 - 15809.12] and a lot of that that data was horrible
[15806.32 - 15811.84] data that he he tried to publish and so
[15809.12 - 15813.92] it happens a lot there are actual
[15811.84 - 15816.16] Journal articles talking about the
[15813.92 - 15818.68] benefit of celer juice and hypertension
[15816.16 - 15820.16] uh while blueberry on dementia um but of
[15818.68 - 15821.72] course the truth is you can find any
[15820.16 - 15824.08] Journal article to support anything you
[15821.72 - 15825.88] want you can cheer i cherry pick these
[15824.08 - 15828.32] things when I post things on you know
[15825.88 - 15830.52] social media so these are the same
[15828.32 - 15832.56] influencers who use this information to
[15830.52 - 15834.52] say you got to buy my collagen powder
[15832.56 - 15837.28] you got to buy my you know electrolyte
[15834.52 - 15839.32] formula or something like this get this
[15837.28 - 15840.80] martial Angel that's a good name to have
[15839.32 - 15842.44] a Marsha Angel who worked at the New
[15840.80 - 15844.60] England Journal of Medicine for two
[15842.44 - 15847.40] decades and became the chief editor said
[15844.60 - 15849.20] this it is simply no longer possible to
[15847.40 - 15850.88] believe much of the clinical research
[15849.20 - 15852.60] that is published or to rely on the
[15850.88 - 15854.92] Judgment of trusted Physicians
[15852.60 - 15856.76] authoritative medical guidelines I take
[15854.92 - 15858.80] no pleasure in this conclusion which I
[15856.76 - 15860.40] reached slowly and reluctantly over my
[15858.80 - 15862.96] two decades as an editor of the New
[15860.40 - 15865.88] England general of medicine right or how
[15862.96 - 15867.32] about this 2016 John Hopkin study
[15865.88 - 15869.52] suggests that medical errors were the
[15867.32 - 15871.84] third leading cause of death in the US
[15869.52 - 15874.16] that is scary not to mention the people
[15871.84 - 15875.12] who were like lose a left arm when they
[15874.16 - 15877.32] were supposed to be the right arm that
[15875.12 - 15878.84] they had supposed to cut you know did
[15877.32 - 15880.84] you know that a recent study published
[15878.84 - 15884.36] in the bush Journal of Psychology and
[15880.84 - 15886.68] Behavioral Medicine showed that 96% of
[15884.36 - 15889.24] participants in the study believe that
[15886.68 - 15892.12] something was a scientific fact when an
[15889.24 - 15894.88] actor spoke congruently and confidently
[15892.12 - 15896.08] about a particular topic if one armor of
[15894.88 - 15897.44] the in one armor of the study
[15896.08 - 15899.52] respondents were told that birds are
[15897.44 - 15902.00] gradually and secretly being replaced by
[15899.52 - 15905.68] drones that work for the CIA to spy on
[15902.00 - 15907.52] people and people believe them now I
[15905.68 - 15909.24] totally pulled that study on my butt
[15907.52 - 15912.76] it's not real I made it up but it
[15909.24 - 15914.92] sounded nice
[15912.76 - 15917.64] I'm just I'm I'm jumping in because I
[15914.92 - 15919.72] need to make an announcement to everyone

[16033.00 - 16038.92] these these stories keep on coming right
[16036.40 - 16041.60] um remember that your story is important
[16038.92 - 16042.72] and your friends telling you advice you
[16041.60 - 16044.52] sometimes take that more importantly
[16042.72 - 16046.96] than what I tell them as an MD and their
[16044.52 - 16049.04] their doctor they'll believe people they
[16046.96 - 16052.80] know so your story matters and you have
[16049.04 - 16053.92] to get out there and talk um so apply
[16052.80 - 16056.28] some of these talking points that I
[16053.92 - 16058.72] brought up right do not approach someone
[16056.28 - 16060.28] and say on you know on a Sunday
[16058.72 - 16062.48] afternoon and and with a medical meeting
[16060.28 - 16063.96] book in your hand go brother have I talk
[16062.48 - 16065.76] to you about accepting medical medium
[16063.96 - 16069.28] into your life you're going to kind of
[16065.76 - 16072.16] scare them so just not do that right I
[16069.28 - 16074.20] um I wish you success and pray that
[16072.16 - 16076.88] Angels help you at every turn and I pray
[16074.20 - 16078.96] you succeed the first part of succeed is
[16076.88 - 16081.40] to suck how many of you people have
[16078.96 - 16083.64] things that suck in your life right
[16081.40 - 16085.84] you're halfway there we're going to go
[16083.64 - 16088.08] forward right and then the next hand the
[16085.84 - 16091.04] next thing is the seed seed is to give
[16088.08 - 16092.72] up something seed this this this idea
[16091.04 - 16094.84] that the body wants to attack it itself
[16092.72 - 16096.80] that you cannot heal that you have
[16094.84 - 16100.72] faulty genes or something like this give
[16096.80 - 16103.16] up that idea and then SE is in SED see
[16100.72 - 16105.36] the thought that you can heal see the
[16103.16 - 16108.24] thought of Tomorrow a better day the
[16105.36 - 16111.56] vision of of of helping yourself and
[16108.24 - 16112.84] others um read other people's stories of
[16111.56 - 16114.64] how they healed when doctors and others
[16112.84 - 16116.52] around them thought they were Nut Cases
[16114.64 - 16118.28] because you'll get that confidence right
[16116.52 - 16120.40] this is this is why these stories are so
[16118.28 - 16121.84] inspiring uh because encourag other
[16120.40 - 16124.28] people to believe your one story could
[16121.84 - 16126.20] be one person in Germany or Finland who
[16124.28 - 16127.88] heals because of this and we've seen
[16126.20 - 16131.04] that happen
[16127.88 - 16133.44] right class of 2024 he in class I'm
[16131.04 - 16135.44] going to end on a cliche but instead of
[16133.44 - 16137.52] telling you to spread your wings I'm
[16135.44 - 16139.44] going to tell you to spread your adrenal
[16137.52 - 16141.12] snacks throughout the day instead of
[16139.44 - 16142.12] telling you to reach for the stars I'm
[16141.12 - 16144.48] going to tell you to reach for the
[16142.12 - 16146.48] stargazing meditation and forget the
[16144.48 - 16148.12] boring advice that don't do it for money
[16146.48 - 16150.08] no you better do these things for to
[16148.12 - 16151.84] earn money so you can afford these
[16150.08 - 16152.56] 15,000 supplements that Coya talked

[17404.04 - 17410.76] for medical medium information and I
[17407.40 - 17412.40] just have to also say that for the
[17410.76 - 17415.20] number of people that are here I've

[17421.32 - 17425.32] I mean for those of you who don't know
[17422.72 - 17427.72] me or my story I've been around in the
[17425.32 - 17431.20] community for over seven years and I've
[17427.72 - 17433.48] watched so many of you grow up and
[17431.20 - 17436.96] graduate from high school graduate from
[17433.48 - 17438.44] college get married have kids it's just
[17436.96 - 17441.80] it's unbelievable how much this
[17438.44 - 17444.32] community is like a family and it's such
[17441.80 - 17447.40] a blessing to be here with all of you
[17444.32 - 17450.44] guys and my journey for those of you who
[17447.40 - 17452.84] don't know my story I mean I started
[17450.44 - 17455.48] when I was a kid I was I had some minor
[17452.84 - 17459.32] symptoms and chronic and autoimmune
[17455.48 - 17461.60] illness runs in my family and I have
[17459.32 - 17464.28] family members who struggled very
[17461.60 - 17466.76] greatly growing up and I watched people
[17464.28 - 17469.56] in my family get bullied and
[17466.76 - 17471.52] disrespected for their symptoms and the
[17469.56 - 17474.60] world was an entirely different place
[17471.52 - 17476.92] even just 10 years ago 15 years ago I
[17474.60 - 17479.04] don't know who remembers there was no
[17476.92 - 17482.00] information out there about what was
[17479.04 - 17484.36] causing people's symptoms and it was
[17482.00 - 17487.68] even really difficult to get diagnosed
[17484.36 - 17490.36] with anything and so much of that has
[17487.68 - 17493.04] changed now because of medical medium
[17490.36 - 17496.92] information and the influence that it
[17493.04 - 17499.52] has had upon the world the medical
[17496.92 - 17501.04] industry the entire health profession
[17499.52 - 17503.04] now people
[17501.04 - 17505.60] who are just out there in the health
[17503.04 - 17507.84] industry are talking about toxic heavy
[17505.60 - 17510.08] metals they're talking about toxic heavy
[17507.84 - 17512.04] metal DET they're talking about heavy
[17510.08 - 17514.32] metal detox they're talking about celery
[17512.04 - 17516.32] juice and even if they don't have full
[17514.32 - 17518.84] information it just it's unbelievable
[17516.32 - 17521.52] how much all of that has disseminated
[17518.84 - 17524.60] out into the world and the health
[17521.52 - 17527.24] industry and we've got doctors now where
[17524.60 - 17529.20] it's it's common practice to test for
[17527.24 - 17532.52] Epstein bar
[17529.20 - 17534.56] virus right
[17532.52 - 17537.16] who remembers how many of you H have had
[17534.56 - 17539.36] an experience where you read it in his
[17537.16 - 17541.48] books something about Epstein bar you
[17539.36 - 17544.28] took it to your doctor and the doctor
[17541.48 - 17546.88] looked at you like what Epstein bar
[17544.28 - 17549.32] virus what do you mean and you couldn't
[17546.88 - 17553.08] get tested you couldn't get diagnosed
[17549.32 - 17555.04] and that's so that's so not that's so
[17553.08 - 17557.56] different from the reality now where you
[17555.04 - 17560.56] can go into pretty much any doctor's
[17557.56 - 17562.40] office and it's they will even tell you
[17560.56 - 17565.08] you if you present with having fatigue
[17562.40 - 17568.84] if you present with having brain fog
[17565.08 - 17571.20] brain fog wasn't even a label for a
[17568.84 - 17573.20] symptom before medical medium
[17571.20 - 17575.80] information nobody knew what brain fog
[17573.20 - 17578.12] was and there are so many people who
[17575.80 - 17580.72] felt like there was something wrong with
[17578.12 - 17582.64] them because when you don't have
[17580.72 - 17583.84] information and there's something going
[17582.64 - 17585.36] wrong in your body and you're
[17583.84 - 17587.28] recognizing that you're having a
[17585.36 - 17589.24] difficult time putting sentences
[17587.28 - 17591.68] together you're having a difficult
[17589.24 - 17593.68] time having having enough energy and
[17591.68 - 17595.44] Clarity to get through the day and when
[17593.68 - 17597.72] you're told oh you know your test
[17595.44 - 17600.76] results show that everything looks
[17597.72 - 17603.68] normal and and I can't find anything
[17600.76 - 17604.92] wrong with you then of course it goes to
[17603.68 - 17606.92] there's something wrong with me there's
[17604.92 - 17609.88] something you know it's it's maybe it's
[17606.92 - 17613.16] in my head that has changed that has
[17609.88 - 17618.12] changed so significantly because of the
[17613.16 - 17620.68] books and I feel very blessed to have
[17618.12 - 17622.68] been fortunate enough to find the books
[17620.68 - 17626.96] and to find the information pretty
[17622.68 - 17630.08] shortly after the first one was released
[17626.96 - 17632.60] and I mean after having those childhood
[17630.08 - 17636.56] experiences of watching my family
[17632.60 - 17639.52] members just suffer so much and not have
[17636.56 - 17641.40] answers and be disrespected and and
[17639.52 - 17644.80] confused you know and blaming themselves
[17641.40 - 17646.60] as a result it just gave me this like
[17644.80 - 17650.12] this fierceness to want to protect
[17646.60 - 17652.72] people who who suffer and then I had my
[17650.12 - 17654.76] own symptoms I had more minor symptoms
[17652.72 - 17656.68] throughout my childhood I was always
[17654.76 - 17659.48] sick I was always the one with a cold
[17656.68 - 17662.88] sore when nobody else at my school had
[17659.48 - 17666.28] cold sores or knew what cold sores were
[17662.88 - 17667.44] you know and I almost didn't graduate
[17666.28 - 17670.16] from high school because I missed so
[17667.44 - 17672.96] many days of school due to being sick
[17670.16 - 17675.32] and I had fatigue I had blood sugar
[17672.96 - 17679.24] problems I had anxiety I had
[17675.32 - 17682.36] depression and then when I got older
[17679.24 - 17685.76] there was a time when I had a series of
[17682.36 - 17686.96] really stressful events that thankfully
[17685.76 - 17689.20] I learned from medical medium
[17686.96 - 17690.92] information served as a trigger not a
[17689.20 - 17692.60] cause because at the time I thought it
[17690.92 - 17695.04] was a cause I thought I was creating my
[17692.60 - 17697.36] own symptoms due to my stress and due to
[17695.04 - 17699.96] the situations that I found myself in
[17697.36 - 17703.12] that weren't within my control and
[17699.96 - 17705.52] that's also something that it's really a
[17703.12 - 17707.48] lot less commonplace now for people to
[17705.52 - 17710.04] think that way and feel that way because
[17707.48 - 17712.16] of how much medical medium information
[17710.04 - 17715.32] has gotten out there and because of how
[17712.16 - 17719.64] much we have access to real answers now
[17715.32 - 17721.80] and so when I first got really sick I
[17719.64 - 17724.72] was in college I was planning on
[17721.80 - 17728.00] becoming a naturopathic doctor and I was
[17724.72 - 17729.64] a science girl I was so everything had
[17728.00 - 17731.88] to be evidence-based I had been
[17729.64 - 17734.20] plant-based I had been eating clean I
[17731.88 - 17735.84] had been off of processed foods for
[17734.20 - 17739.80] years and I thought I was taking really
[17735.84 - 17743.04] good care of myself and then I you know
[17739.80 - 17745.20] a series of stressful events can can
[17743.04 - 17749.56] knock anybody down if you don't have
[17745.20 - 17752.28] accurate information and so I got so
[17749.56 - 17755.28] sick so quickly that I wasn't able to
[17752.28 - 17758.16] work wasn't able to go to school I was
[17755.28 - 17761.36] bedridden I was in this cycle of being
[17758.16 - 17764.12] hospitalized every two weeks for months
[17761.36 - 17766.40] and months and months and I was 21 years
[17764.12 - 17769.28] old it was it was terrible and nobody
[17766.40 - 17771.16] around me understood what was going on
[17769.28 - 17773.72] and every time that I would go to the
[17771.16 - 17776.40] hospital I would be told that my blood
[17773.72 - 17780.16] work was fine as so many of you have had
[17776.40 - 17782.48] similar experiences and I was told that
[17780.16 - 17784.20] I was going to have to live with my
[17782.48 - 17785.68] symptoms and conditions for the rest of
[17784.20 - 17788.96] my life that the best thing that I was
[17785.68 - 17791.40] going to be able to do would be to use
[17788.96 - 17795.56] antibiotics and pain medications to
[17791.40 - 17798.88] manage my symptoms forever and I had
[17795.56 - 17801.16] Interstitial cystitis I had my fatigue
[17798.88 - 17803.84] got really bad at that point I had a lot
[17801.16 - 17806.80] of neurological symptoms I would get
[17803.84 - 17810.32] heart palpitations and mystery fainting
[17806.80 - 17813.64] spells and I had acne I had gained
[17810.32 - 17815.76] weight even while I was I thought taking
[17813.64 - 17817.84] such good care of myself and I was
[17815.76 - 17821.64] somebody I learned through the
[17817.84 - 17825.28] information that just needed to go a lot
[17821.64 - 17829.24] further and I also learned from medical
[17825.28 - 17831.60] medium information why it was that I got
[17829.24 - 17833.64] to the point of being so sick even when
[17831.60 - 17836.28] I was taking better care of myself than
[17833.64 - 17839.40] anybody I knew it was because I
[17836.28 - 17842.00] inherited pathogens talks cevy Metals I
[17839.40 - 17844.80] inherited other exposures and then I was
[17842.00 - 17847.48] also exposed to a lot throughout my life
[17844.80 - 17850.60] and then the stress was a trigger and so
[17847.48 - 17854.00] just having that information of it's not
[17850.60 - 17857.08] my fault it's not it wasn't that I did
[17854.00 - 17860.32] something wrong it was all these factors
[17857.08 - 17862.48] that were out of my control and then
[17860.32 - 17864.52] once you get empowered with the
[17862.48 - 17867.88] information then you can do something
[17864.52 - 17870.88] about it and so I'm very fortunate that
[17867.88 - 17872.44] I you know my mom had gotten me the book
[17870.88 - 17875.44] The First Medical medium book for
[17872.44 - 17880.16] Christmas one year and because I was
[17875.44 - 17885.24] such a science girl a Premed I at first
[17880.16 - 17887.92] I scoffed at it and I was like medical
[17885.24 - 17890.40] medium what is this guy going to tell me
[17887.92 - 17894.56] about my health and you know what are
[17890.40 - 17897.32] his credentials and I was that girl and
[17894.56 - 17897.32] boy was I
[17897.60 - 17902.72] humbled I shortly after is when I got
[17900.56 - 17905.68] really sick and you know what when I was
[17902.72 - 17907.80] bedridden and was seeing naturopaths I
[17905.68 - 17910.84] was seeing every different type of
[17907.80 - 17912.56] practitioner that was out there and
[17910.84 - 17914.88] going on elimination diets doing
[17912.56 - 17916.84] everything that I was told to do and
[17914.88 - 17919.72] still not getting better and still not
[17916.84 - 17922.80] being able to function I was like all
[17919.72 - 17926.56] right what is this medical medium guy
[17922.80 - 17929.40] GNA say and I cracked open the book gave
[17926.56 - 17933.12] it a chance and within the first page I
[17929.40 - 17933.12] was balling my eyes
[17933.35 - 17938.00] [Applause]
[17934.96 - 17941.72] out how many of you guys cried when you
[17938.00 - 17943.52] first read the book yeah yeah you don't
[17941.72 - 17944.92] get that right like where else where
[17943.52 - 17946.80] else do you get that kind of experience
[17944.92 - 17949.04] what other kind of book you know in the
[17946.80 - 17950.52] health industry would you read and and
[17949.04 - 17953.28] so many people have just described
[17950.52 - 17955.20] having a spiritual experience and just
[17953.28 - 17957.60] getting emotional within even just the
[17955.20 - 17960.44] first few pages you can just feel
[17957.60 - 17962.56] there's so much and the living words and
[17960.44 - 17965.80] the books and it just resonates as being
[17962.56 - 17969.00] such truth that just doesn't Exist
[17965.80 - 17972.56] Elsewhere and so I had that experience I
[17969.00 - 17976.44] was humbled and I was blown away blown
[17972.56 - 17978.16] away because I could not believe how
[17976.44 - 17982.48] much that first
[17978.16 - 17983.80] book it made so much logical sense
[17982.48 - 17986.80] everything that's in there more than
[17983.80 - 17988.24] anything I had studied in my premedical
[17986.80 - 17990.72] program more than anything I had seen
[17988.24 - 17993.76] out there in alternative medicine I
[17990.72 - 17995.80] could see what I was missing and how I
[17993.76 - 17997.00] had to take it further and then I
[17995.80 - 17999.40] applied the
[17997.00 - 18002.80] information and it took me some time you
[17999.40 - 18006.04] know to get it right and then I within
[18002.80 - 18008.88] six months healed over 30 symptoms and
[18006.04 - 18010.04] conditions and lost over 30 lbs without
[18008.88 - 18014.20] even trying

[18573.84 - 18577.64] incredible to be in a group like this
[18576.24 - 18579.52] you think about all the groups that are
[18577.64 - 18582.00] organizing on the planet today to do
[18579.52 - 18583.72] different things for people to take the
[18582.00 - 18585.96] time to come here for themselves for

[18591.12 - 18595.40] of course speaks to Anthony you know
[18593.16 - 18599.80] plain and simple uh he's been in our
[18595.40 - 18603.32] life 14 15 years yeah I think since 2010
[18599.80 - 18606.36] long long time um we've been
[18603.32 - 18608.92] doing lemon water celery juice both
[18606.36 - 18612.64] smoothies and a variety of other things
[18608.92 - 18614.80] for at least 12 years yeah right yeah at
[18612.64 - 18620.04] least 12
[18614.80 - 18623.04] years I stopped eating uh meat at least
[18620.04 - 18626.20] probably 10 years ago and that went and
[18623.04 - 18629.04] then Dairy and uh sugars and
[18626.20 - 18631.76] caffeine um and then I did fish for
[18629.04 - 18635.40] about two more years and then that was
[18631.76 - 18637.92] the end of the fish and I miss my
[18635.40 - 18640.16] oysters but they don't miss
[18637.92 - 18644.56] me they're Happ be there stay in the
[18640.16 - 18646.72] ocean do your thing uh but uh we were
[18644.56 - 18648.96] drawn to Anthony for a variety of
[18646.72 - 18651.04] reasons which my wife Chelsea will
[18648.96 - 18653.48] explain but I just want to say it's an
[18651.04 - 18654.84] honor to be here and to be in the middle
[18653.48 - 18658.64] of all
[18654.84 - 18660.60] of all of us likeminded people who are
[18658.64 - 18664.20] interested in doing taking control of
[18660.60 - 18666.00] our health situation and and doing
[18664.20 - 18669.08] something positive and sharing it and
[18666.00 - 18670.80] putting it out there so uh I I Applause
[18669.08 - 18673.04] to everybody that's here and for showing
[18670.80 - 18675.56] up it's hot it's a long line all those
[18673.04 - 18677.72] things you are all to be commended and
[18675.56 - 18680.32] I'm just honored to be uh a part of this
[18677.72 - 18682.00] community myself take it away I'm going
[18680.32 - 18683.64] to get some cards and go hand them out
[18682.00 - 18687.44] at the end of the line so if I disappear
[18683.64 - 18690.96] that's where I'll be um yeah I I second
[18687.44 - 18694.96] what Scott said it's just an honor
[18690.96 - 18697.36] to um have like-minded people to discuss
[18694.96 - 18701.44] all things mm because I'm sure you can
[18697.36 - 18704.76] relate to talking to friends who aren't
[18701.44 - 18707.20] mmm minded and it can be frustrating
[18704.76 - 18710.92] sometimes
[18707.20 - 18710.92] right where do you get your
[18711.84 - 18714.84] protein
[18716.00 - 18720.84] many the best cartoon I ever saw was a
[18719.44 - 18723.68] um
[18720.84 - 18727.04] T-Rex and wait is it a t no the long
[18723.68 - 18730.76] neck what's that called long the long
[18727.04 - 18732.60] neck yeah that and then the Velociraptor
[18730.76 - 18735.24] behind it and the Velociraptor was
[18732.60 - 18738.28] saying but where do you get your protein
[18735.24 - 18741.36] and the long neck was going geez this
[18738.28 - 18743.64] guy how we all feel those of us who are
[18741.36 - 18746.04] plant-based um what do you guys want us
[18743.64 - 18746.04] to talk
[18747.64 - 18754.92] about um well the way we met Anthony was
[18751.36 - 18756.84] through my my mom um and it was kind of
[18754.92 - 18759.16] you know I think orchestrated in the
[18756.84 - 18761.12] stars because uh my mom had a cont
[18759.16 - 18763.00] contractor that was working for her um
[18761.12 - 18766.20] doing some work at her house and I
[18763.00 - 18768.88] didn't know him very well and he was
[18766.20 - 18770.76] telling this story of his adoption which
[18768.88 - 18773.56] was sort of a touching story and I was
[18770.76 - 18775.60] you know listening and compassionate and
[18773.56 - 18777.64] about two weeks after that he called me
[18775.60 - 18781.04] and said
[18777.64 - 18783.04] um hi it's Joe and I said hi and he said
[18781.04 - 18784.28] I and I had noticed when he was telling
[18783.04 - 18786.52] us the story
[18784.28 - 18788.20] that he was coughing like that every
[18786.52 - 18790.00] once in a while and he was a big
[18788.20 - 18791.52] strapping
[18790.00 - 18794.44] like that he would do that every you
[18791.52 - 18797.40] know 30 seconds and he was very strong
[18794.44 - 18799.12] strapping young guy and I at the time I
[18797.40 - 18801.52] sort of unconsciously thought well
[18799.12 - 18803.44] that's interesting he must be a smoker
[18801.52 - 18806.88] and so he calls me like three weeks
[18803.44 - 18809.56] after working for my mom and says um I
[18806.88 - 18811.00] have some problems in my health and I
[18809.56 - 18814.12] got this guy's
[18811.00 - 18815.96] number and he's like he used the word
[18814.12 - 18818.04] psychic he's like psychic he tells you
[18815.96 - 18820.20] what's wrong with you do you think I
[18818.04 - 18822.88] should call him first of all I'm like
[18820.20 - 18827.52] why are you calling me I hardly know you
[18822.88 - 18828.88] you know and but I said well Joe like he
[18827.52 - 18831.84] goes do you believe in those things and
[18828.88 - 18833.52] I said yeah I do absolutely and maybe
[18831.84 - 18836.00] that's why he was calling me but I said
[18833.52 - 18837.60] yes I do and I said what's the worst
[18836.00 - 18840.68] that can happen once you start talking
[18837.60 - 18842.32] to him you're going to know your your
[18840.68 - 18844.04] cells in your body are going to tell you
[18842.32 - 18845.64] this this feels right or this doesn't
[18844.04 - 18847.24] just like when I read Anthony's first
[18845.64 - 18851.24] book how many of you just your whole
[18847.24 - 18853.24] body was going yes yes yes yes
[18851.24 - 18855.12] right you're reading this you're like
[18853.24 - 18856.88] this but this makes so much sense this
[18855.12 - 18859.72] is so good okay so back to the story
[18856.88 - 18861.60] with Joe so he says okay I'm going to
[18859.72 - 18864.80] call him well that was Anthony that was
[18861.60 - 18866.68] way back in 2009 or 10 when he was still
[18864.80 - 18868.52] um doing
[18866.68 - 18870.12] appointments and then I didn't hear from
[18868.52 - 18871.56] him for a while and then he called me a
[18870.12 - 18873.68] few weeks later and told me the whole
[18871.56 - 18876.60] story which was Anthony said you have
[18873.68 - 18879.24] this very unusual bacteria in your lung
[18876.60 - 18881.20] it comes from and I don't remember the
[18879.24 - 18883.80] exact River but it was like it comes
[18881.20 - 18884.96] from the Black Snake River in Arkansas
[18883.80 - 18886.68] let's say that's what it was but it
[18884.96 - 18889.64] wasn't that I don't know what it was but
[18886.68 - 18891.00] this was a long time ago and so Joe he
[18889.64 - 18893.20] goes I don't know how you would have
[18891.00 - 18896.04] gotten this Anthony says this to Joe and
[18893.20 - 18897.72] Joe says well my partners parents live
[18896.04 - 18899.32] on the Black Snake River in Arkansas and
[18897.72 - 18902.12] I was there for a
[18899.32 - 18904.72] month so he says okay why do I see
[18902.12 - 18906.72] drywall and Joe said well I'm a
[18904.72 - 18909.16] contractor um and he said okay the
[18906.72 - 18911.12] drywall is not causing the problem but
[18909.16 - 18913.72] not helping you get better can you
[18911.12 - 18916.00] eliminate some of that so he said yes so
[18913.72 - 18917.56] anyways Anthony said to him your doctors
[18916.00 - 18919.00] are good doctors they're great but
[18917.56 - 18920.40] they're going to misdiagnose this
[18919.00 - 18922.56] they're going to misdiagnose it as
[18920.40 - 18924.36] cancer and sure enough about a month
[18922.56 - 18926.24] later Joe gets a call on a Friday night
[18924.36 - 18928.12] from his doctor saying get your partner
[18926.24 - 18929.84] come in here and get your things in
[18928.12 - 18933.52] order
[18929.84 - 18935.40] meaning you're done and of course Joe
[18933.52 - 18937.76] freaked out called Anthony Anthony's
[18935.40 - 18940.36] like you're fine they've just m
[18937.76 - 18944.52] misdiagnosed us keep doing your protocol
[18940.36 - 18948.40] and Joe is completely healthy and still
[18944.52 - 18952.52] working and killing it so
[18948.40 - 18955.68] yeah so how that connects to my mom is
[18952.52 - 18958.64] my mom had a sciatic nerve pain for like
[18955.68 - 18962.20] two years and she kept going to the her
[18958.64 - 18963.84] doctors she was 86 or 84 at the time and
[18962.20 - 18966.16] one doctor said to her oh Barbara this
[18963.84 - 18967.28] is just this is what it is to be 80 for
[18966.16 - 18970.96] and I was
[18967.28 - 18973.20] like that no you shouldn't be in this
[18970.96 - 18975.08] kind of pain and I kept begging her to
[18973.20 - 18976.60] let me call Anthony and try to make an
[18975.08 - 18979.36] appointment I didn't know him I just
[18976.60 - 18980.84] heard through him through Joe and so
[18979.36 - 18983.00] finally after three months of me
[18980.84 - 18985.56] bothering my mom she said okay and we
[18983.00 - 18987.84] called and Anthony immediately diagnosed
[18985.56 - 18990.00] it as shingles a certain variety of
[18987.84 - 18993.20] shingles that is not the kind where you
[18990.00 - 18994.80] get the rash and we got the um
[18993.20 - 18996.84] supplements for her and he recommended a
[18994.80 - 19000.36] few dietary dietary
[18996.84 - 19002.20] changes and within two days I called her
[19000.36 - 19007.16] and I said hey Mom it's chelse and she
[19002.20 - 19009.40] goes oh hi darling how are you and I was
[19007.16 - 19012.12] so surprised because it was her voice
[19009.40 - 19013.68] was back her real voice not the voice
[19012.12 - 19016.12] that I'd heard for the last two years
[19013.68 - 19018.88] that she had been in pain so she got
[19016.12 - 19018.88] better and lived to be
[19019.00 - 19024.32] 95 passed away a few years
[19021.72 - 19026.44] ago so you know we've been doing this
[19024.32 - 19029.96] protocol for a long time as Scott said
[19026.44 - 19032.00] and um we love it and I don't know I
[19029.96 - 19033.80] maybe a few months ago I was having some
[19032.00 - 19036.08] little tingling stuff down my leg and I
[19033.80 - 19038.08] was doing the juicing and our whole
[19036.08 - 19041.20] morning is like we have dueling juicers
[19038.08 - 19043.92] we have two juicers mm juicers and our
[19041.20 - 19047.32] youngest over there Owen does the whole
[19043.92 - 19048.92] protocol o also so we're like excuse me
[19047.32 - 19051.44] excuse me excuse me trying to get to the
[19048.92 - 19054.32] sink and do our cleaning of our celery
[19051.44 - 19057.44] and all that and I was I was juicing and
[19054.32 - 19059.28] I was kind of like H you know why am I
[19057.44 - 19063.24] even doing this this isn't because I was
[19059.28 - 19065.36] having some you know some symptoms and I
[19063.24 - 19068.24] was feeling discouraged and then I
[19065.36 - 19071.20] thought well what else am I going to do
[19068.24 - 19073.76] I'm GNA like half a cup of coffee
[19071.20 - 19078.76] no so I kept
[19073.76 - 19080.96] juicing um it's the best as you know um
[19078.76 - 19082.92] and we love Anthony he's incredibly
[19080.96 - 19083.96] generous and compassionate as you know
[19082.92 - 19086.60] sometimes I talk to him on the phone and
[19083.96 - 19089.28] I'm like you are so patient how do you
[19086.60 - 19091.36] do it um
[19089.28 - 19093.08] and anything else anything else you guys
[19091.36 - 19095.96] want to know
[19093.08 - 19098.20] or yeah you're all
[19095.96 - 19102.76] good
[19098.20 - 19105.84] how I guess maybe he has grown with his
[19102.76 - 19108.00] patience over the years because his
[19105.84 - 19112.32] mission which is to help everybody and
[19108.00 - 19113.68] to get the books out um just override he
[19112.32 - 19115.48] really is incredibly patient because
[19113.68 - 19117.84] I've heard him like do you guys remember
[19115.48 - 19119.92] when he did the radio show and he was
[19117.84 - 19122.28] doing the before the yeah the hey House
[19119.92 - 19123.76] Radio Show before the podcast sometimes
[19122.28 - 19125.68] when people would call in I would just
[19123.76 - 19127.96] be
[19125.68 - 19129.76] like and he's just saying oh well you
[19127.96 - 19131.24] can try this and do that he was super
[19129.76 - 19132.48] patient because people would ask about
[19131.24 - 19134.08] things that had nothing to do with their
[19132.48 - 19138.16] health and that's when I'm like oh my
[19134.08 - 19141.00] goodness gracious no um I think that
[19138.16 - 19143.20] he's just obviously very gifted you know
[19141.00 - 19146.36] he's had this amazing gift given to him
[19143.20 - 19148.68] from above and
[19146.36 - 19151.44] um beautiful person and we feel
[19148.68 - 19154.44] incredibly fortunate to call him our
[19151.44 - 19154.44] friend
[19156.20 - 19160.12] yeah just one I want to say one more
[19158.76 - 19163.32] thing and then we're going to go do some
[19160.12 - 19165.00] other stuff uh my wife says this all the
[19163.32 - 19168.28] time to everybody because we get a lot
[19165.00 - 19170.16] of phone calls all the time can you get
[19168.28 - 19171.80] M information to Anthony can we ask
[19170.16 - 19176.36] questions can we do that
[19171.80 - 19178.36] and it really is in the books and if you
[19176.36 - 19181.24] and if you if you haven't read them and
[19178.36 - 19184.44] if you haven't explored them um the
[19181.24 - 19186.12] reason he has stopped doing in person
[19184.44 - 19189.08] and all of those things was so that he
[19186.12 - 19192.40] could get the information in a book so
[19189.08 - 19195.40] that it would be there for everybody to
[19192.40 - 19198.04] take advantage of for years to come and
[19195.40 - 19199.68] that's a that's the biggest gift uh I I
[19198.04 - 19202.00] I I don't think people will understand
[19199.68 - 19203.40] that because we T we take for granted
[19202.00 - 19204.92] Anthony's here we can you know he's
[19203.40 - 19206.16] going to keep doing his thing and we're
[19204.92 - 19209.20] going to keep getting question we can go
[19206.16 - 19212.68] and watch him online and da d da but
[19209.20 - 19214.68] it the books are invaluable and um I
[19212.68 - 19216.76] encourage everybody to spread them
[19214.68 - 19221.00] around and read them if you get a chance
[19216.76 - 19223.40] the Brain book is insane there's I just
[19221.00 - 19225.16] kept saying I can't I don't no I don't
[19223.40 - 19228.20] believe that I can't believe that that's
[19225.16 - 19230.80] amazing where did that come from um that
[19228.20 - 19233.04] and that's a a a big read but as equally
[19230.80 - 19236.40] is the celery book and I'm not selling
[19233.04 - 19238.28] books up here I'm just saying uh there's
[19236.40 - 19239.40] so much value in that and I'm grateful
[19238.28 - 19242.32] that he
[19239.40 - 19245.04] really really put himself out there to
[19242.32 - 19247.40] make these books as a gift to all of us
[19245.04 - 19250.36] so thank you and thanks for being here
