[111.12 - 117.92] um live in concert um
[115.04 - 119.60] joanne moore says hair loss for years
[117.92 - 120.24] for women's hair loss it's a lot
[119.60 - 122.64] different than
[120.24 - 124.64] it's entirely different than men's hair
[122.64 - 127.68] loss women's adrenals
[124.64 - 131.52] have a hormone in them
[127.68 - 133.60] that is what keeps hair on
[131.52 - 134.72] your head and that so that's what what
[133.60 - 136.96] happens there and so
[134.72 - 139.76] women lose that hormone inside their
[136.96 - 142.32] adrenals that one specific hormone
[139.76 - 143.84] that keeps the hair follicles alive and
[142.32 - 145.44] they lose it because of years of
[143.84 - 148.32] caffeine from years before
[145.44 - 149.36] so years of caffeine of all kinds
[148.32 - 152.64] chocolate
[149.36 - 153.68] coffee tea whatever and and even if it's
[152.64 - 156.08] green tea
[153.68 - 157.60] and so no one tells you the caffeine
[156.08 - 159.44] industry and i talk about this medical
[157.60 - 160.48] media podcast at apple podcast you guys

[451.52 - 455.04] incredible secret journey uh you got a
[454.48 - 457.20] question
[455.04 - 458.56] how to heal chronic pancreatitis the
[457.20 - 459.52] first thing i would do if i had chronic
[458.56 - 461.92] pancreatitis
[459.52 - 463.12] if i had that first thing i would do is
[461.92 - 465.36] lower fats
[463.12 - 467.36] you've got to lower fats and then i
[465.36 - 469.20] would bring in like kabocha squash i
[467.36 - 470.64] would bring in delicata squash i would
[469.20 - 472.56] bring in some potato
[470.64 - 474.40] i would bring in all that i would bring
[472.56 - 476.32] in some fruit i would bring in
[474.40 - 478.72] of course some leafy greens but what i
[476.32 - 479.44] what i would do is not bring in the nut
[478.72 - 482.32] butters
[479.44 - 482.88] not bring in the oils not bring in the
[482.32 - 485.44] chicken
[482.88 - 486.16] meat chronic pancreatitis get off animal
[485.44 - 488.80] products
[486.16 - 489.92] and i'm not anti-animal products i mean
[488.80 - 493.28] i'm pro-vegan
[489.92 - 495.52] i'm pro-plant-based for sure for pro
[493.28 - 496.96] plant-based and pro-vegan but i'm also
[495.52 - 498.40] i'm pro-animal products
[496.96 - 501.04] diets if you if that's what someone
[498.40 - 503.28] wants to do but when i'm not pro
[501.04 - 504.24] is doing everything wrong and people do
[503.28 - 505.92] vegan diets wrong
[504.24 - 508.80] plant-based diets wrong animal protein
[505.92 - 512.08] diets wrong they just do the diets wrong
[508.80 - 514.48] and but if i had chronic pancreatitis
[512.08 - 515.84] i would get off the animal products gone
[514.48 - 519.92] right there because you can't
[515.84 - 520.80] heal pancreatitis while eating pork
[519.92 - 523.36] while eating
[520.80 - 524.48] chicken fat you just kill your pancreas

[558.80 - 561.76] like haven't i've been through enough
[560.08 - 563.28] you guys have no idea like
[561.76 - 564.80] pete they have no idea you guys have an
[563.28 - 568.64] idea but um
[564.80 - 571.44] but yeah so lucas says
[568.64 - 572.56] can you explain function of tonsils
[571.44 - 575.84] please
[572.56 - 577.52] mine are swollen very often any idea
[575.84 - 579.76] thank you much anthony
[577.52 - 582.08] um that well first of all your your
[579.76 - 583.44] tonsils are part of your immune system
[582.08 - 585.60] right there that they're part of your
[583.44 - 588.40] immune system so your lymphatic system
[585.60 - 589.60] and tonsils are hand in hand okay that's
[588.40 - 592.16] to protect you right
[589.60 - 594.32] but what happens is the tonsils get
[592.16 - 594.64] inflamed when we get streptococcus that
[594.32 - 596.56] are
[594.64 - 598.72] that's chronic doesn't mean you're gonna
[596.56 - 599.60] see it so when the doctor does a swab on
[598.72 - 601.44] your throat
[599.60 - 602.88] on your tonsils doesn't mean they're
[601.44 - 603.36] gonna they're gonna be able to culture
[602.88 - 605.52] that
[603.36 - 606.56] because it gets deep in the tonsils not
[605.52 - 609.04] on the surface
[606.56 - 610.40] streptococcus epstein bar mono all those
[609.04 - 612.24] things those are the things
[610.40 - 614.08] that keep tonsils swollen but they go in
[612.24 - 615.84] undiagnosed doctors don't know
[614.08 - 617.36] so if you were a family member or
[615.84 - 618.88] somebody they can because i had a family
[617.36 - 620.40] member come to me last month with
[618.88 - 624.08] swollen tonsils
[620.40 - 625.68] and a cousin and i was like look
[624.08 - 628.48] that's that's low grade viral and
[625.68 - 629.92] streptococcus go to your doctor

[708.16 - 714.00] podcast you can't miss those
[710.24 - 714.72] um luke luke skull can you heal your
[714.00 - 717.68] eyes
[714.72 - 719.04] you're always got glasses on it mustn't
[717.68 - 720.80] be good too good
[719.04 - 722.56] well luke here's how it works with my
[720.80 - 724.96] eyes okay so that you know
[722.56 - 725.76] and if it depends on how long you've
[724.96 - 728.40] known me
[725.76 - 729.92] because a lot of uh people who know the
[728.40 - 730.96] medical medium information and know
[729.92 - 732.80] about me and stuff
[730.96 - 734.24] i could see fine i could read all your
[732.80 - 736.24] comments just like this
[734.24 - 737.36] there's there's nothing wrong there what
[736.24 - 739.60] happens is
[737.36 - 740.56] i hear a voice and when i hear that
[739.60 - 743.44] voice
[740.56 - 744.16] that voice is very hard on me and i hear
[743.44 - 747.28] it very
[744.16 - 747.76] loud and then because all you guys are
[747.28 - 750.32] on
[747.76 - 752.16] all right i'm getting information so
[750.32 - 753.20] information just comes through while i'm
[752.16 - 755.28] here with you
[753.20 - 757.04] then i get what's called snow blindness
[755.28 - 758.88] because of it since i was age four
[757.04 - 760.72] when i get the information from spirit
[758.88 - 763.60] of compassion and i start
[760.72 - 765.60] getting that the visuals and start the
[763.60 - 766.32] the reeds start coming in and all that
[765.60 - 769.20] stuff
[766.32 - 771.12] it squints my eyes i squint them so if
[769.20 - 772.96] you want to see me squint
[771.12 - 774.32] you're going to see me squint this way
[772.96 - 775.84] if you put the glasses on you're not
[774.32 - 777.20] going to see me squint so much the
[775.84 - 779.92] glasses kind of hide it
[777.20 - 780.96] it's a technique i've used my whole life
[779.92 - 783.36] don't need them
[780.96 - 784.80] you know i don't have to have them but
[783.36 - 786.56] then my whole life people are going to
[784.80 - 788.80] see me and once i get the reads
[786.56 - 790.56] once spirits talking to me once that
[788.80 - 791.92] white light is coming down
[790.56 - 794.00] i'm going to start squinting a little
[791.92 - 794.56] bit like this you see this that's how it
[794.00 - 796.64] works
[794.56 - 798.56] so when that happens it's better when
[796.64 - 800.64] these are on when that's happening
[798.56 - 803.04] that's how it works i don't need to heal
[800.64 - 804.80] my eyes i got the best vision there is
[803.04 - 806.24] actually that anybody can have
[804.80 - 807.68] so i'm just letting you know right there
[806.24 - 808.64] and how it works for squinting and
[807.68 - 812.00] everything
[808.64 - 814.00] lorraine l um i'm so you know you know
[812.00 - 816.24] lorraine l says i'm still in love with
[814.00 - 818.24] all the meditations nothing else like

[825.12 - 828.56] don't need the glasses
[826.64 - 830.00] and i people have said that before but
[828.56 - 831.76] when you learn about medical medium
[830.00 - 832.48] information you saturate yourself in the
[831.76 - 836.08] books
[832.48 - 839.36] you won't have questions like that or
[836.08 - 839.36] concerns or however
[841.28 - 847.60] but but good question good question and
[844.40 - 847.60] i hope you come to tick tock
