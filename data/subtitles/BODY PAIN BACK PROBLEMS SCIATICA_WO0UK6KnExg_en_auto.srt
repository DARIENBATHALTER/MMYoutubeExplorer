1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,799
body pain back pain

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:06,319
you know the thing is with the back a

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,160
lot of people have sciatica they've got

4
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:10,240
the sciatic nerve pain

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,480
they're in pain all the time they're

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,559
walking around aching and everything and

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,759
the problem is with backs

8
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:16,960
is that

9
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:18,800
it's not just about seeing a

10
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,160
chiropractor which is fine you can see a

11
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,240
chiropractor if somebody wants they can

12
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,400
get massage if somebody wants

13
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,560
they can get back surgery if somebody

14
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,000
wants right not that they always want

15
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,480
back surgery but a lot of people get

16
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,360
pushed into it the key is

17
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,520
why is it inflamed right is is it a

18
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,440
degenerative disc issue

19
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,800
right but here's the thing

20
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,399
a lot of people walk around and their

21
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,960
backs are shot

22
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:45,520
they got bulging discs degenerative disc

23
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,200
issues right spinal stenosis they get

24
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,320
all these kinds of issues going on with

25
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,320
their back

26
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,760
but they're not in any pain whatsoever

27
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,160
so they're not in any pain good to see

28
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,320
you guys coming on here they walk around

29
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,760
and they're fine and that's what's

30
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,960
confusing

31
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:03,120
probably to a lot of doctors out there

32
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,400
and a lot of chiropractors and a lot of

33
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,600
natural doctors holistic doctors

34
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,960
functional medicine doctors where

35
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,799
they're like why isn't something

36
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,640
happening here if they ever take a look

37
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,799
at somebody's lumbar somebody's lower

38
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,960
spine and they're like well they've got

39
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,799
a two bulging discs right and the

40
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,280
person's not hurting

41
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,920
and how does this happen

42
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:24,960
one reason is it takes more than a

43
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,560
pinched nerve to have pain and so many

44
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,200
people have pain

45
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,640
in their back right and that's just one

46
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,479
area in their back they have pain in

47
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,159
other places too good to see you guys

48
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:36,640
coming on talking about back problems

49
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,159
and body pain right specifically back

50
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,680
problems for a lot of people sciatic

51
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,040
acidic nerve pain

52
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,479
so

53
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,960
the thing is with nerve pain

54
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:47,840
inflammation

55
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:50,960
can take back problems to a whole other

56
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:54,159
level so its inflammatory issues can

57
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,360
take your back problem to a whole other

58
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,680
place

59
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:01,520
someone with a bulging disc if they're

60
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,640
not inflamed they won't have a problem

61
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,520
somebody

62
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,360
with a bulging disc that's inflamed will

63
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,360
have a problem and that's a big big

64
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,039
thing so many people get they get into

65
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,959
back surgery

66
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:14,480
so they have back surgery done

67
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,840
and it doesn't fix the problem and

68
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,920
they're confused like this it was

69
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,200
supposed to go away this was supposed to

70
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,480
no i was not supposed to have this

71
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,239
problem the doctor would be like well

72
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,920
you know we did your back surgery you

73
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,000
should be walking in three days you

74
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,440
should be all better and there they are

75
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,680
they're not better and they have these

76
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,440
back problems and it goes on for like a

77
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,280
year and two years and three years and

78
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,120
four years and it just keeps on going on

79
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,000
even after back surgery a lot of people

80
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,480
get repeated back surgery too so why is

81
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,480
this important because a lot of people

82
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:46,480
without realizing it right

83
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:49,519
have this nerve inflammation so the

84
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:52,000
nerves are inflamed in their back

85
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,680
and that's what they don't know so i

86
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,920
want to bring this over for a second too

87
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,920
okay

88
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,360
good to see you guys coming on here

89
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,920
we're talking about sciatic nerve pain

90
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,840
or back pain a lot of people have it

91
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,680
and you know a lot of people suffer from

92
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,000
it and the whole bit and it's something

93
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,760
that i don't talk about too often

94
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,360
because there's so many other problems

95
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,760
people have and so many other conditions

96
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,440
like brain conditions and everything

97
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,560
else right that we talk about but when

98
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,400
it comes down to back problems and

99
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,400
here if you're if you feel young if

100
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,480
you're young and you feel indestructible

101
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,879
you haven't had anything hit you yet you

102
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,239
just get a massage once in a while right

103
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,080
it's like who cares about your back and

104
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,000
then you pull out your back in a sense

105
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,080
like a back muscle if you work out too

106
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,920
hard or something like that you know and

107
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,360
then and a lot of people do that well

108
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,840
they'll just they'll pull a muscle out

109
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,400
i'm talking about when back problems

110
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,640
become this chronic illness problem this

111
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,560
chronic issue and that chronic issue

112
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,879
just doesn't go away and it stays there

113
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,959
forever and that's what we're we're on

114
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:52,400
right now so

115
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,360
it takes

116
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,599
inflammation of that nerve to really

117
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,159
make a back problem happen unless you

118
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:02,400
get a fracture or you get a break or you

119
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:04,799
got degenerative disease where the the

120
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,879
disc just crumbles and falls apart

121
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,400
completely falls apart and then now

122
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,920
you've got pressure on all the nerves

123
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,560
and that's a different situation but

124
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:15,760
most people out there right

125
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:18,560
they have nerve pain

126
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:21,840
okay and that nerve pain isn't because

127
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:24,639
of a bulging disc that nerve pain isn't

128
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,240
because of something else and that's

129
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,479
important to like degenerative disc

130
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,240
problems there's people out there their

131
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:32,639
backs are chewed up their backs are shot

132
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,320
their their vertebrae is is damaged in

133
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,759
so many ways but they're out there and

134
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,360

their backs are shot

139
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,040
but it's that one moment where

140
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,720
all you need

141
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,720

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,479
still dealing with sciatic nerve pains

189
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:29,120
attica you're dealing with problems in

190
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:30,960
the back problems in the lumbar so this

191
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,120
is important right now so what i what i

192
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,199
tell people friends and family

193
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,759
that have a back problem

194
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:40,000
okay they go to their doctor the doctor

195
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,919
checks out their back right they're like

196
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,400
well you got you've got a little bit of

197
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:46,960
a bulge in one disc or you're a little

198
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,720
degenerative at another disc right

199
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,080
where everything looks fine we don't

200
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,680
know why your back hurts and that's

201
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,240
another thing too

202
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,400
a lot of people everything checks fine

203
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,319
checks out fine in their back

204
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,919
everything checks out okay

205
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,599
but they don't know why they're in pain

206
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,280
they just don't know why their leg is

207
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:05,120
numb they don't know why their foot

208
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,319
hurts they don't know why they have pain

209
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,919
in the calf

210
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,840
they don't have any of that so that's

211
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:12,560
important to know

212
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,000
a lot of people

213
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,560
a lot of people

214
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,160
right will have pain in their knee

215
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:22,319
they'll have pain in their ankle pain

216
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,840
somewhere in their foot

217
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,759
and they'll get a diagnosis of like

218
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,400
plantar fasciitis they'll get some other

219
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:30,160
type of diagnosis right but really

220
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,479
what's happening the pain is coming from

221
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,319
their lower back and that's where it's

222
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:36,080
coming from so you can get pain in your

223
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,720
legs you can get numbness you can get

224
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:41,039
tingling in the legs you can get

225
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,039
problems in the legs and feet which can

226
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:45,599
lead to a different diagnosis meanwhile

227
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:48,240
the problem is inflammation with the

228
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:50,400
sciatic nerve in inflammation with the

229
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,639
tibial nerve inflammation with the lower

230
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:57,120
lumbar right the lumbar it could be

231
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:59,759
inflammation in you know l5 l4 l3 l2 l1

232
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,960
could be inflammation in all of those

233
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,800
and that's people will deal with that's

234
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,759
what they do they deal with this chronic

235
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,400
problem

236
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:08,080
any advice on degenerative discs so the

237
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,840
whole thing is what i'm trying to say is

238
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:14,080
that when you get your inflammation

239
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,199
down something changes

240
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,879
something changes i'm going to talk

241
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,960
about degenerative discs and bone

242
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:21,120
problems too with all that when you get

243
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,919
your inflammation down

244
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:26,639
i've seen even the worst backs

245
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:28,479
recover and get better debbie evans says

246
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,080
hello the celery juice took away my back

247
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:31,840
pain that's incredible because the

248
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,479
inflammation went down from the celery

249
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:36,800
juice alone i have r.a

250
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:39,039
and i used to have so many aching places

251
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,360
in my body you're on facebook debbie

252
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:43,440
evans amazing

253
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,200
well that's what happens is like celery

254
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,160
juice is one of the medical medium tools

255
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:50,320
right and it has an ability to change

256
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,640
people's lives even if they're just

257
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,839
doing that a lot of people they may need

258
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,440
more than that and there's a lot of

259
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:57,360
medical medium tools but the celery

260
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,959
juice is helping because it's knocking

261
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,519
down

262
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:03,600
viral inflammation so that's what it's

263
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,600
doing it's knocking down viral

264
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,760
inflammation now if celery juice doesn't

265
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,839
do the trick for a lot of people then

266
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,000
that's when a lot of other things have

267
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,519
to be thought about like one is

268
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,680
when you're dealing with back problems

269
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:18,640
you're dealing with nerves right

270
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:21,279
so that's when b12 is critical so that's

271
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,279
a big piece of how we keep our nerves

272
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:26,000
good it's through b12 that's another

273
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:28,240
example right there okay magnesium is a

274
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
good thing for for nerves and it's good

275
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,080
thing for problems like that but guess

276
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,240
what

277
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:37,839
when it's viral inflammation

278
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,600
then you're looking at things that are

279
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:42,160
anti-viral right where you're looking at

280
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,399
like lysine and you're looking at stuff

281
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,000
like that these things make a difference

282
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,640
p there's a lot of people with stubborn

283
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,240
back problems they just don't go away

284
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,920
and the stubborn back problems are

285
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,279
because they're dealing with viral

286
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,680
inflammation

287
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:57,760
a pathogen so it's critical to have the

288
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,959
right type of stuff the right kind of

289
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,720
stuff right and so

290
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,800
this is the vimergy stuff right here i'm

291
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,880
not sponsored but this is the vimergy

292
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:09,760
stuff that's the microc that's the

293
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:11,920
lysine because when you're dealing with

294
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,279
inflammation you're dealing with pain in

295
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,160
the body

296
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:18,640
and it's mysterious

297
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:21,279
then there's something going on immune

298
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:24,320
system problems along with pathogen

299
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:26,399
issues along with viral issues and you

300
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,640
know so we have to realize you got

301
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:31,200
immune system is low

302
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:33,600
uh pathogens are increasing so what's

303
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,519
the number one pathogen that gets in the

304
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,920
way when it comes to back problems the

305
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:40,720
number one pathogen that gets in the way

306
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,640
with the back problem you guys

307
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,399
is the shingles virus

308
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,600
that's the number one and you don't have

309
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,120
to have

310
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,760
shingles

311
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:52,160
to have that back pain okay

312
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,920
you don't have to see the shingles like

313
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,399
you don't have to see the pustules of

314
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:58,720
the shingles stripped across your chest

315
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:01,120
you're stripped across your back or

316
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,640
on your leg or on your butt or on your

317
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,399
thigh you don't even need to see the

318
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:07,600
shingles for it to cause problems the

319
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:09,920
shingles virus sits in everybody and it

320
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,240
can cause a problem one way or another

321
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,640
as time goes on so what happens is we're

322
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,480
living our life our immune system gets

323
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,079
knocked down it gets knocked down by

324
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,399
different things different problems that

325
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:22,800
we're up against our immune system gets

326
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:25,839
knocked down right

327
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:28,720
like betrayal and hardship and loss can

328
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:30,480
break down our immune system okay

329
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,720
foods that aren't good for us can break

330
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,600
down our immune system over time

331
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,040
and

332
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,600
these different things break down immune

333
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:40,160
system and then viruses like the

334
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,880
shingles can creep up and creep up but

335
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,880
when that virus creeps up it loves a

336
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:47,120
couple of different areas it loves the

337
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,760
trigeminal nerve it loves to be up here

338
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,760
in this area okay and it can cause

339
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:54,079
things like bell's palsy it can cause

340
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,920
things like trigeminal nerve pain that's

341
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,720
one thing shingles and another thing it

342
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,760
does

343
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,560
it can

344
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:02,959
actually more commonly too

345
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:05,200
it gets into the nerves in the lower

346
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:07,200
back so shingles can get into the nerves

347
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,920
and lower back another thing too

348
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,680
it's the big body pain causer for so

349
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,279
many people of course you can mess up

350
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,560
your back of course you can have pinched

351
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:17,760
nerves of course you can have a

352
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:20,480
vertebrae problem but guess what

353
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:23,040
if a viral issue is combined with that

354
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,959
vertebrae vertebrae problem if a viral

355
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,839
issue is combined with that pinched

356
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,680
nerve

357
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:29,839
if a viral issue like shingles is

358
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:32,079
combined with

359
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:34,480
that inflame that sorry that sciatic

360
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:37,120
nerve or tibial nerve when that virus is

361
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,839
involved it takes it

362
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:42,240
and it explodes it the impact is so much

363
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,920
more so now you've got sciatic problems

364
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,839
forever you've got problems with your

365
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,920
back forever it's like not a good day my

366
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:50,160
back's not doing good you know i'm gonna

367
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,680
go see somebody else from my back and

368
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,839
you have these problems that could be

369
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,920
long-lasting so what happens is if

370
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,600
someone has like neurological lyme or if

371
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,320
they have something like multiple

372
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,639
sclerosis or if they got lupus or they

373
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,639
got fibromyalgia it usually comes with

374
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:07,360
back pain too because you're dealing

375
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,480
with pathogens and when those pathogens

376
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,519
are up

377
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:13,680
they tend to cling onto nerves and the

378
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:16,320
lumbar is a place where the shingles

379
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:18,240
likes to cling on to that's a big area

380
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,959
that the shingles likes to cling on to

381
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:23,440
likes to cling onto the lumbar so one of

382
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:25,760
the things that i tell my family

383
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:28,800
and i teach doctors is you got to get

384
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:30,320
the immune system strong right you got

385
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,320
to get the immune system strong there's

386
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,720
some olive leaf right

387
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,959
licorice is another thing

388
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,560
these are antiviral you know you got the

389
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:40,160
licorice you got the

390
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,880
got the olive leaf you got the cat's

391
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,639
claw okay that's one way of doing it you

392
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,240
can be somebody where you just do celery

393
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,920
juice and you start with celery juice

394
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,560
and that's what you use and celery's

395
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:53,839
used as anti-pathogenic so what soda

396
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:55,040
just does is it reduces pathogen levels

397
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,720
in the body

398
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,920
that's what celery juice does so that's

399
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,600
why a lot of people are like i'm

400
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,959
drinking celery juice

401
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,240
like debbie said i'm drinking celery

402
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,000
juice for a certain amount of time and

403
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,680
all of a sudden now things are getting

404
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,279
better my back pain is getting better my

405
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,480
problems are getting better but there's

406
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:11,279
a lot of people

407
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:13,199
they're really viral they have a lot of

408
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,959
viral inflammation they'll have two or

409
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:16,800
three epstein bars they'll have a

410
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:19,040
shingles they'll have two shingles

411
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:22,720
viruses and don't even know it

412
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:25,199
and they get into that lower back that's

413
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,519
what they do and especially the shingles

414
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:29,600
virus the problem there is then we have

415
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:32,000
pew dental nerve problems where we have

416
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,560
bladder problems and we have nerve pain

417
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,959
in our groin and nerve pain pain in our

418
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:39,199
lower abdomen and nerve pain in our

419
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:41,040
pudendal nerve down there in the bladder

420
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:42,000
and that will happen too

421
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,079
and

422
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,399
the shingles virus tends to cause all of

423
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:48,560
this while it's also clinging on to the

424
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:51,040
lumbar nerves and clinging on to getting

425
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,800
in between the vertebrae and inflaming a

426
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:56,240
nerve and here's one of the reasons why

427
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:57,360
it does that if a nerve does get pinched

428
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,959
right

429
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,600
root hairs

430
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:03,600
fray off of that nerve and when root

431
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,920
hairs fray off of that nerve

432
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,399
a signal happens inside the body it's

433
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:10,240
like a homing signal for a pathogen and

434
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,600
that's when the shingles virus will go

435
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,560
looking for

436
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,480
and i've talked about this in the

437
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:17,120
medical media books it'll go looking for

438
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,560
that damaged nerve that injured nerve

439
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,480
and that's what it does

440
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,160
so you'll end up with

441
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,680
you guys if you just came on here and

442
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,839
talked about sciatic nerve pain body

443
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:28,079
pain joint pain we're just talking about

444
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:29,519
back problems this is an important lie

445
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:31,440
for anybody who's struggling with back

446
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,360
issues and stuff like that it's really

447
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,360
good information um

448
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:38,399
which can be really helpful

449
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:40,880
so as nerve hairs get frayed you guys

450
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:43,839
nerves like the sciatic nerve or typical

451
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:46,160
nerve or any of these nerves coming off

452
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:48,720
the spine when they get frayed

453
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,680
because these root hairs come off the

454
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,199
nerve

455
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,199
kind of like yarn i don't know if you

456
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:55,120
guys ever seen a strip strip of yarn

457
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:57,360
where you got all these little hairs on

458
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,839
that yarn all popping up all over the

459
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,199
place well guess what when that happens

460
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,160
and it happens to a lot of people's

461
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:04,959
nerves

462
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:07,120
viruses like the shingles look for that

463
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:09,440
and that virus goes and it clings on to

464
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,800
the nerve is what it does when it clings

465
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,880
onto the nerve

466
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,800
the nerve swells

467
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,800
so now the nerve swells so now

468
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,720
somebody's sciatic level sciatic pain

469
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,399
level is even more and now somebody's

470
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,639
static nerve pains even more and that

471
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,480
leads us into this vicious cycle

472
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:26,079
the more pain we're in with our lower

473
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,519
back the more chances we're going to

474
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,959
jolt it or hurt it and that's what

475
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,000
happens people walk around they hurt

476
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:31,839
their back

477
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,759
you know other things happen marla says

478
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:36,079
totally i've had back issues seeing a

479
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:38,079
cairo for years amazing now following

480
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:40,160
medical medium protocols i'm finally

481
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:41,600
healing oh that's incredible doing the

482
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,199
medical media protocols for the back

483
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,480
issues the chiropractor says it's like

484
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:48,000
adjusting

485
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:50,079
a different body that's amazing marla

486
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,240
you know that's that's amazing so i see

487
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:54,240
a question on tick tock says how do you

488
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,759
get the shingles so

489
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,279
here's the thing with shingles shingles

490
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:59,600
is easy to get you can catch the

491
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:01,199
shingles in just a public restroom just

492
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,839
off the toilet seat

493
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:05,839
very easy just off the toilet seat i

494
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:07,199
often talk about

495
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:09,360
how you got to look out when you're

496
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:11,679
going to bathroom in a public restroom

497
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:14,400
you got to flush the toilet first

498
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:16,959
before you sit down to eliminate because

499
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:20,000
when you sit down to eliminate as you're

500
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:22,480
dropping that torpedo into the toilet

501
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,720
yeah talked about this so many times a

502
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,480
splash can happen and that splash has

503
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,160
other things in the toilet bowl i've

504
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,679
talked about all these different

505
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,200
pathogens in there and you can have

506
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,880
shingles could be just floating on top

507
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,200
of the water and it just splashes back

508
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,799
up could be on toilet seats restaurants

509
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,640
eating out restaurants is probably one

510
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:39,840
of the biggest ways to actually catch

511
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,600
the shingles

512
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:44,400
um there's there's so much shingle

513
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,000
contamination just in that in that alone

514
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,000
so yeah so what happens if people don't

515
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,400
realize that we we would we in

516
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,080
restaurants were eating off of forks the

517
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,760
forks weren't sterilized there's a lot

518
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,960
of stuff i've talked about about that

519
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,200
with the forks

520
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,120
where forks aren't sterilized so when

521
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,559
you go to a dentist

522
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,400
and the dentist sticks a drill in your

523
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:03,840
mouth or sticks a probe like the metal

524
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,200
probe have any of you guys what been to

525
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,400
a dentist where the dentist takes a

526
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,919
metal probe

527
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,240
and they're poking around and they're

528
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:11,200
they're jamming it into your teeth right

529
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,000
okay

530
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,080
well

531
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,919
that's that's basically you go to a

532
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:18,559
restaurant and they're not sticking that

533
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:20,720
in a you know like a um you know a

534
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:22,480
sanitizer they're not doing that they

535
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,799
put those tools in these little and

536
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,559
these little bug killer machines right

537
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:28,480
that's what they do or they they open up

538
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:30,400
brand new tools for people they just

539
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,080
open them up and they poke in their

540
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,760
mouth to the brand new tool that's never

541
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,840
touched another person's mouth when you

542
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:38,240
go into a restaurant they don't take the

543
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:40,080
forks and the spoons and they don't put

544
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,760
it into like

545
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:44,240
literally like a ten thousand dollar

546
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,760
unit to actually kill everything on them

547
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,919
instead they just run through a crappy

548
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,520
dishwasher if you're lucky they do that

549
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:51,120
in the restaurants busy restaurants if

550
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:53,360
you're lucky you can do that now you got

551
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:55,520
a fork that's been in 20 people's mouth

552
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:57,360
that mounts that day you know 10

553
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,679
people's mouths a day or that week or

554
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:01,120
whatever and then you're using that fork

555
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,480
and you're jamming it in your gums and

556
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,880
you're hitting your tongue with it and

557
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:07,440
that's how we get the shingles

558
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:09,280
that's one reason right there so that so

559
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,600
this information is could be helpful for

560
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,520
you guys like i'm not eating out anymore

561
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,960
relationships is another way to get

562
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,360
shingles

563
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:19,200
it's it's relationships is how everybody

564
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,640
transfer bugs that's how everybody's

565
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,000
transferring bugs they're transferring

566
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,760
the upsy bar they're transferring the

567
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,520
shingles or transferring these bugs back

568
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:28,000
and forth and in relationships that's

569
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:30,080
another big way it's done all the time

570
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
so people just all everybody has at

571
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,360
least one variety of shingles in them

572
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,679
and eventually they'll have like a

573
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,440
sciatic nerve pain problem and here's

574
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:39,520
how it works

575
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,760
someone if their shingles hasn't come

576
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:44,240
out of dormancy

577
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,919
they can have some damaged back

578
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,559
right damaged vertebrae they could have

579
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:50,320
pinched nerves but they're not in pain

580
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:51,520
a lot of people walk around they're not

581
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,200
in pain

582
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:55,200
they have like you know bulging discs

583
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,200
they have problems with with their back

584
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,960
and they're not in pain but then you get

585
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,640
somebody right

586
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,400
who has hardly anything wrong with their

587
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,159
back or nothing wrong with their back at

588
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,400
all that can be seen with the eye

589
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:08,320
through x-rays or anything else or

590
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,760
through an mri or an x-ray or anything

591
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,919
at the chiropractor's office and they

592
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:14,080
can't even see there's nothing there and

593
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,520
then they still have all this mysterious

594
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,600
back pain

595
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,200
right all that mysterious back pain

596
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,840
that's because the shingles virus can

597
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:24,559
cause this even if you don't have

598
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:26,799
a back injury or or a sciatic nerve

599
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:29,200
that's being compressed or any kind of

600
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:31,120
nerve that's being pinched or any nerves

601
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,960
off the lumbar that's being pinched

602
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,480
right the whole bit so all that's

603
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,880
important to know

604
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,880
what i do is what i tell doctors all the

605
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,640
time is if you want to get back problems

606
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:43,039
better the first thing you got to do

607
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,480
instead of jumping into surgery and back

608
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:46,080
surgery because a lot of people jump

609
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,360
into back surgery

610
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,679
and then as they come out of back

611
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,600
surgery man it's not getting better and

612
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:53,600
now what the heck they're on painkillers

613
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,520
now they're on opioids now they're on a

614
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,280
lot of painkillers and now they're

615
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,640
addicted to painkillers and they still

616
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:01,280
have the back problem and it's

617
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:03,120
post-surgery and they're suffering right

618
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,720
and i tell doctors

619
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,640
whenever doctors reach out and doctors

620
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,320
have known for years i tell them what

621
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,799
you have to do is you have to make sure

622
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:12,559
you try to get that inflammation down

623
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:14,880
first that's a big thing it's getting

624
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:17,600
that inflammation down

625
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:19,440
first if you're even going to do a back

626
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,760
surgery you have to work on getting

627
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,120
inflammation down first unless it's a

628
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,960
crisis

629
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,720
where there's just such a crisis in the

630
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,320
back because of a severe injury or

631
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,640
something that just happened you know

632
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,400
sometimes people can't avoid that but

633
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,240
overall

634
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:37,120
it's really important to know that

635
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:39,679
there's measure there's you can take

636
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:41,919
you can take precautions in so many ways

637
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:44,080
and avoid back surgeries i've had so

638
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:45,440
many people avoid back surgeries so a

639
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:48,640
couple of things let's talk about a

640
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:50,880
couple of tips to do okay first of all

641
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,480
if you're somebody that's really acidic

642
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,159
and really toxic you're doing your

643
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,600
caffeine right you guys on tick-tock

644
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:57,280
you're doing your caffeine products i

645
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,640
know you guys on tick-tock

646
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,559
i know a lot of you guys are jacked up

647
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,559
on caffeine and there's no judge i'm not

648
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:03,919
judging anyone here same thing with you

649
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:05,280
guys and

650
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:07,600
and you know in other places too on

651
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:09,200
facebook wherever else it's i get it

652
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,880
everybody's on caffeine all that but

653
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,919
caffeine

654
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:16,880
really makes an acidic body and the more

655
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:19,360
acidic we are the more room we're gonna

656
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,960
have for eventually pathogen issues

657
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:23,039
another thing is dairy products a lot of

658
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:25,600
people are doing a lot of dairy products

659
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:28,320
okay that's another thing that could

660
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:31,200
make our body right environment really

661
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:32,640
acidic okay vinegar that's another one

662
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,000
right there too i know everybody's on

663
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,679
vinegar every other day it's in

664
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,520
condiments it's in your refrigerator

665
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:39,760
these you know everybody's mainlining

666
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:41,360
all that vinegar right so

667
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,679
and what we're doing is when we're doing

668
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:45,919
all that

669
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:48,400
we're starting to lose all our calcium

670
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:49,919
so we're weakening all of our bones so

671
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,760
we've got to remember that that's one

672
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:54,240
thing right there so in order to

673
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,440
preserve your lumbar preserve your

674
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,000
vertebrae

675
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,280
preserve your spine and your bones and

676
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,440
your skull

677
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:03,600
is to get that acidity under control so

678
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:06,080
you're not using

679
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,600
your calcium to neutralize all the other

680
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,799
stuff you're doing like the dairy

681
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,600
products and

682
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:13,840
and and the caffeine and the vinegar so

683
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:15,520
we have to keep that in mind right a lot

684
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:18,080
of us are just really acidic and that

685
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:21,120
doesn't help but the acidity can lower

686
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:23,120
the immune system allowing pathogens to

687
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:25,440
creep up like shingles and then when

688
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,960
pathogens like shingles creeps up we

689
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,960
inflame the nerves and then that

690
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:32,400
pathogen inflames all the different

691
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:34,159
nerves and that's important to know and

692
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,440
so we end up hurting ourselves we hurt

693
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:36,640
our back

694
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,880
and we got

695
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,080
we got a real acidic environment in our

696
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,400
body right

697
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:44,720
we're totally acidic our immune system

698
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,640
is already struggling a little bit and

699
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,480
then all it takes is that and then boom

700
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,559
the shingles virus comes out and when it

701
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,640
comes out

702
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:54,480
when it comes ripping out

703
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,080
you don't need a rash you don't need

704
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,919
pustules you don't have to have any

705
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:00,000
punctuals you don't have any rashes you

706
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:01,760
don't need any of that to have shingles

707
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,679
the shingles virus

708
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:06,080
does things on its own without

709
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:09,919
showcasing that pustule or that rash and

710
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:12,159
it goes into the lumbar into the nerves

711
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:14,320
attaches itself to the sciatic nerve

712
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:18,400
attaches itself to nerves coming off of

713
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:21,520
l1 lt l3 l4 l5 it attaches itself to

714
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:23,919
those lumbar nerves coming out okay

715
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:26,559
out of the spine and it attacks it it

716
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:28,640
attaches itself to the tibial nerves

717
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:31,440
and attach itself to the pudendal nerve

718
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,720
in the front so a lot of people okay a

719
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,559
lot of people

720
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,360
right in the front the pudendal nerve

721
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:37,120
okay

722
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,799
that shingles virus will attach into the

723
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,480
pudendal nerve and then they have the

724
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:43,039
overactive bladder then they have the

725
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,960
bladder pain then they have the bladder

726
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:47,200
problems then they have all that weird

727
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:49,279
the terrible itching in their lower

728
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,919
abdomen that they can't like get any

729
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:53,919
kind of just you know any kind of relief

730
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:55,600
from all these problems can happen from

731
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,120
the shingles virus getting into the

732
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,640
lower part of the body so i guess the

733
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,080
bottom line is one of the things i'm

734
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,159
trying to tell you guys is the shingles

735
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:04,640
virus can get into the lower part of our

736
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:07,360
body and wreak a lot of havoc

737
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:09,200
and what it does it gets into the spine

738
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:11,840
the lower spine and that's where it

739
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:14,159
causes a lot of turmoil the shingles

740
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,600
virus there so some of the basic steps

741
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:18,400
and i tell doctors to tell their

742
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:20,400
patients is celery juice is a great

743
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:22,799
place to start there's no question if

744
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,559
you're doing 16 ounces a day empty

745
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:26,080
stomach every single morning don't add

746
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:27,760
anything to it that right there is

747
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,919
something you can start with because

748
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:33,039
that at least starts to bring the

749
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:36,400
inflammation down by getting toxins and

750
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:38,159
poisons that the viruses create to flush

751
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,679
out of the body okay

752
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:40,880
here's where back problems get really

753
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:41,760
bad

754
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,159
right

755
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:45,520
you got the shingles virus your nerves

756
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:47,520
are inflamed

757
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:49,840
your sciatic nerves are inflamed your

758
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,039
lumbar is inflamed okay

759
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,200
and then

760
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:55,520
you also have an epstein bar

761
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,840
right at the same time that's out

762
00:25:55,520 --> 00:26:00,080
a lot of people they struggle because

763
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:02,559
they'll have the fibromyalgia diagnosis

764
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:04,480
with the neurological dia lyme diagnosis

765
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:06,720
with the back problem diagnosis from the

766
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,480
chiropractor with some other diagnosis

767
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:11,200
and they'll be into like four or five

768
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:13,039
diagnoses they'll have the epstein bars

769
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,679
with the shingles they'll have an

770
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:17,520
inflamed back and body pain everywhere

771
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:19,919
so it's confusing so let's go into that

772
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,679
now a lot of people will have two

773
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:23,679
viruses

774
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:25,840
they'll have the shingles causing

775
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:27,840
sciatic pain and body pain and joint

776
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:30,080
pain in the back and in the hips and

777
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:32,799
then they'll have the epstein bar

778
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:36,400
causing nerve pain everywhere shoulders

779
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:38,960
arms hands in other places in the body

780
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:40,480
neck right they'll have the epstein bar

781
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,640
with this shingle so they'll have a

782
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,640
combination of both and people walk

783
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:47,520
around with all these low-grade viral

784
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:49,440
infections and they're highly inflamed

785
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:52,159
and they don't know what they can do

786
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:54,159
about it one of the things i recommend i

787
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:56,400
recommend any family members i tell

788
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:58,480
doctors is too is to make sure you're

789
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,080
doing the cold packs on the lower spine

790
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,000
when you've got sciatic nerve pain make

791
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:04,080
sure you're doing that every day you can

792
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,520
do some heat on it in the morning that's

793
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:08,559
something you can offer heat on it in

794
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:10,480
the morning is fine right cold packs too

795
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:12,400
you know on your lower back that's a

796
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:15,200
great thing you do

797
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:17,520
right and movement's important too

798
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,360
okay so movement is important michelle l

799
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,880
says shingles has caused so much pain it

800
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,840
causes a lot of pain with a lot of

801
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,840
people

802
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:26,000
movement's good too but you got to take

803
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:28,000
it slow movement really slow depending

804
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,399
on how you're inflamed i've seen a lot

805
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,360
of people get pushed into

806
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:36,159
heavy exercise with their trainers while

807
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:37,760
they're inflamed from viral inflammation

808
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:40,000
they don't know about in their lower

809
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:42,320
back and then it takes them to another

810
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,480
level where now they're really hurting

811
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:46,399
really bad and then up for then they're

812
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,399
eligible for a back surgery which could

813
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:50,399
be avoided which could have been avoided

814
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:53,679
so anyway some of the other things do is

815
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:55,840
is to take the viral load down it's like

816
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:57,760
dropping down the inflammation and

817
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,200
that's the next thing you can do and

818
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,960
that's why i talk about in the medical

819
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,399
