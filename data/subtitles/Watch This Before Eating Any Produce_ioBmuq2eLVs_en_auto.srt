1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,200
so we have is the butternut squash

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:08,320
there's a divot in here why

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:10,000
because there was a pretty big hole

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,240
poked into this

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,280
i see it all the time in the market and

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,520
what people don't realize is those holes

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,039
right here's one here

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,600
those gashes

9
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,359
that was equipment gashes

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,160
and those gashes

11
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:28,960
there's grease on that equipment so a

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,960
little bit of grease goes into like

13
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,960
because i've seen all the farm equipment

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,239
i visit a lot of farms visit some

15
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:38,559
friends farms i've spent all around and

16
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:42,079
all that farm equipment there's grease

17
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:43,680
on every tractor grease on everything

18
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,920
and what happens is people don't realize

19
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,760
this so when you see when you see

20
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,239
injuries to things you want to cut them

21
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,280
out because you can have some grease

22
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:56,640
so what you want to do is carve out any

23
00:00:53,280 --> 00:01:01,359
suspicious hole or

24
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,359
mark that's big enough you carve it out
