[1.92 - 4.88] you hear people talk about meditation
[3.52 - 7.28] all the time that's what they'll talk
[4.88 - 8.48] about i meditate i'm doing my meditation
[7.28 - 11.12] in the morning
[8.48 - 13.36] i'm doing my meditation
[11.12 - 15.44] why is everybody meditating because
[13.36 - 17.12] their brains are messed up
[15.44 - 19.04] their brains are messed up
[17.12 - 21.04] that's why they're meditating their
[19.04 - 22.96] brains weren't so messed up
[21.04 - 24.32] they wouldn't be meditating
[22.96 - 25.44] no one would be sitting there for an
[24.32 - 27.60] hour
[25.44 - 29.36] trying to meditate when they got a lot
[27.60 - 31.04] of things to do people be really busy
[29.36 - 33.12] and everything but their brains are
[31.04 - 34.64] messed up depression anxiety
[33.12 - 37.36] depersonalization
[34.64 - 39.28] right and that that's just three words
[37.36 - 41.28] that cover
[39.28 - 42.72] thousands and thousands of endless
[41.28 - 44.32] different symptoms in it right there
[42.72 - 45.52] just so you know depersonalization you
[44.32 - 47.76] could have feelings of sadness
[45.52 - 49.28] loneliness loss of hope not knowing
[47.76 - 50.88] where you are not worrying not knowing
[49.28 - 52.96] where you should be wanting to be
[50.88 - 54.32] someplace else right whatever it is
[52.96 - 56.00] feeling disconnected not feeling
[54.32 - 57.84] connected feeling disconnected from
[56.00 - 58.96] loved ones feeling like you can't see
[57.84 - 60.72] feeling like you can't hear like
[58.96 - 62.80] depersonalization is unbelievable like
[60.72 - 64.48] the vast amount of
[62.80 - 65.28] symptoms right
[64.48 - 66.80] but
[65.28 - 69.36] people have to understand the reason why
[66.80 - 70.96] we meditate and everybody meditates is
[69.36 - 72.72] because they either
[70.96 - 74.24] have something that they're not settled
[72.72 - 75.76] with they're not happy with they're
[74.24 - 77.36] looking for happiness they're looking to
[75.76 - 79.04] elevate their happiness they're looking
[77.36 - 81.20] to elevate their well-being they're
[79.04 - 82.96] looking to spiritually achieve they're
[81.20 - 85.12] looking to kind of rise out of whatever
[82.96 - 87.04] it is they're stuck in whatever it is we
[85.12 - 89.12] meditate because
[87.04 - 90.88] something's messed up
[89.12 - 92.40] something's messed up
[90.88 - 94.56] it's not like everything's perfect
[92.40 - 96.40] everything's incredible like you
[94.56 - 98.96] everything nothing is wrong with
[96.40 - 101.04] anything anyhow anywhere i'm just gonna
[98.96 - 103.12] go meditate
[101.04 - 104.88] right it doesn't really work like that
[103.12 - 106.88] we start searching for meditations we
[104.88 - 108.72] start searching for reasons to meditate
[106.88 - 110.64] and reasons to actually achieve that
[108.72 - 112.96] kind of extra help with our brain and
[110.64 - 115.44] consciousness and mind spiritual mind
[112.96 - 117.28] body however we want to look at it
[115.44 - 119.76] because something's wrong
[117.28 - 122.16] something's wrong that's why
[119.76 - 123.04] because something's wrong
[122.16 - 125.28] and then
[123.04 - 126.48] we don't realize that i see people all
[125.28 - 127.60] the time they got brain fog they're
[126.48 - 129.44] struggling and they're like i gotta
[127.60 - 131.44] meditate because i have to meditate to
[129.44 - 133.28] try to help me with my brain fog
[131.44 - 135.76] but yet i'm having a difficulty
[133.28 - 137.76] difficulty with meditating because of my

[150.08 - 153.60] something's wrong right one of the
[152.32 - 155.76] things that
[153.60 - 158.72] is interesting what do you use when you
[155.76 - 160.72] meditate you use your brain
[158.72 - 162.88] you actually use your brain
[160.72 - 165.92] that's what you're using

[569.60 - 573.04] beefed up
[570.96 - 574.00] really bad out there you see it every
[573.04 - 575.44] day
[574.00 - 577.12] and a lot of people are just losing
[575.44 - 579.20] their minds
[577.12 - 581.36] it's not has nothing to do with
[579.20 - 583.68] it has nothing to do with people being
[581.36 - 586.64] crazy or not that's not it
[583.68 - 588.88] so we have to kind of be able to
[586.64 - 590.48] separate that understand that it's not
[588.88 - 591.76] about being crazy
[590.48 - 593.52] you can lose your mind when you're
[591.76 - 594.56] suffering from anxiety you can lose your
[593.52 - 596.00] mind when you're suffering from
[594.56 - 597.68] depression when you're suffering from
[596.00 - 599.28] ocd you can lose your mind when you're
[597.68 - 600.80] just you don't know what you're
[599.28 - 602.24] suffering with and understand you don't
[600.80 - 604.32] even know why you're dealing with what
[602.24 - 606.16] you're dealing with
[604.32 - 607.60] you can you can feel like you're losing
[606.16 - 609.60] your mind
[607.60 - 612.72] but you're not crazy
[609.60 - 612.72] you're not crazy
[612.80 - 617.04] okay just because you have anxiety or
[615.28 - 619.44] depression or depersonalization are
[617.04 - 620.72] bipolar or schizophrenia or anything
[619.44 - 623.36] like that or
[620.72 - 625.04] you're just brain fogged
[623.36 - 627.12] from here to high heaven you're just
[625.04 - 628.72] brain fogged
[627.12 - 630.88] and what feels like you're in hell when
[628.72 - 633.28] you're brain fog that bad too
[630.88 - 635.44] and and you're not crazy just because
[633.28 - 638.08] you your brain fogged out and you're
[635.44 - 640.00] struggling you're not crazy if you have
[638.08 - 641.52] adhd you're not crazy if you're
[640.00 - 643.76] struggling with something with your mind
[641.52 - 645.20] and body
[643.76 - 646.80] and with your brain without even
[645.20 - 648.00] realizing it's really your brain too

[742.08 - 745.68] that direct passageway into the soul
[744.24 - 747.84] you're trying to use the subconscious
[745.68 - 750.08] consciousness right into the soul
[747.84 - 751.60] right when you're meditating and we're
[750.08 - 753.52] trying to use our physical brain to kind
[751.60 - 755.28] of connect that that's what we're doing
[753.52 - 756.32] right
[755.28 - 757.44] we're trying to get spiritually
[756.32 - 759.04] connected
[757.44 - 760.40] we're trying to get grounded right when
[759.04 - 762.24] we're meditating so we're actually

[768.24 - 771.52] to connect to a bubble that's that's
[769.84 - 773.44] something right there meditations don't
[771.52 - 775.60] mean you're just sitting there like
[773.44 - 777.04] doing ohms and you're just sitting there
[775.60 - 780.00] that doesn't mean that you can be
[777.04 - 783.20] sitting on your back porch
[780.00 - 784.84] looking at a bird fly by
[783.20 - 787.20] and
[784.84 - 788.80] contemplating that's a meditation right
[787.20 - 790.24] there

[790.24 - 793.36] class i mean you're welcome to you don't
[792.08 - 794.72] have to be in a meditation class
[793.36 - 796.32] somewhere
[794.72 - 797.60] right
[796.32 - 799.52] with a bunch of hippies around you and
[797.60 - 800.72] you're in a meditation class or you
[799.52 - 802.48] don't have to be you don't have to be in
[800.72 - 803.84] a meditation class with a whole bunch of
[802.48 - 805.84] wealthy people around you that are in
[803.84 - 808.72] some resort somewhere up on some
[805.84 - 808.72] mountain in aspen
[810.08 - 813.76] you don't have to be in a meditations
[811.76 - 816.80] class you can be anywhere you can be
[813.76 - 818.32] anywhere you can be literally
[816.80 - 819.60] in your room you wake up one morning and
[818.32 - 822.64] you're still laying in your bed and you
[819.60 - 822.64] can meditate right there
[823.12 - 827.44] you can lay in your bed in your bedroom
[825.68 - 829.28] right when you wake up in the morning
[827.44 - 830.64] and right when you wake up
[829.28 - 832.64] what you do
[830.64 - 835.12] is just start thinking about what clouds
[832.64 - 837.20] look like
[835.12 - 838.88] and what the sky looks like and you
[837.20 - 840.72] think about the bluest sky you've ever
[838.88 - 842.48] seen
[840.72 - 844.08] and you close your eyes and you envision
[842.48 - 845.52] you're looking at that blue sky right
[844.08 - 848.16] when you wake up that's a powerful
[845.52 - 848.16] meditation
[848.40 - 851.84] you don't have to be about around a
[849.92 - 854.00] bunch of sweaty people
[851.84 - 855.92] in some resort somewhere or you don't
[854.00 - 857.68] have to be around somewhere else or
[855.92 - 859.92] whatever
[857.68 - 862.72] people don't have to be sweaty or not
[859.92 - 864.80] depends if they just did yoga
[862.72 - 866.56] but the point is is you don't have to do
[864.80 - 868.24] that
[866.56 - 870.40] there's a lot of ways to do powerful
[868.24 - 872.64] small meditations that are really true
[870.40 - 874.08] powerful meditations
[872.64 - 875.68] and you can do them real quick and easy
[874.08 - 878.64] you can be sitting literally in a chair
[875.68 - 881.52] outside in nature and you can see a bird
[878.64 - 883.20] fly by you can see a pigeon land
[881.52 - 885.12] if you're in the city and you can get a
[883.20 - 887.52] meditation right off of looking at a
[885.12 - 887.52] pigeon
[887.76 - 892.16] but what are you trying to do
[890.48 - 893.52] trying to alleviate something you're
[892.16 - 896.80] trying to heal something you're trying
[893.52 - 898.48] to achieve something you're trying to
[896.80 - 900.56] bridge a gap
[898.48 - 902.40] too right
[900.56 - 903.84] hannah t says this is an incredible live
[902.40 - 905.12] i'm honored
[903.84 - 907.44] it's an incredible life because you're
[905.12 - 907.44] here
[908.16 - 912.24] so when it comes down to meditation
[910.48 - 913.68] meditation is hard for a lot of people
[912.24 - 914.96] who have been through hell and back too
[913.68 - 918.16] they've been there and done that they
[914.96 - 920.08] tried different meditations
[918.16 - 921.36] right they've done different things and
[920.08 - 923.12] it just didn't feel like they got
[921.36 - 925.52] anywhere with it too a lot of people
[923.12 - 927.12] have a lot of panic and anxiety so
[925.52 - 928.48] trying to meditate it's really difficult
[927.12 - 929.68] for them if they got tightness to the
[928.48 - 931.36] chest and they're trying to breathe and
[929.68 - 932.80] meditate it's hard for a lot of people
[931.36 - 934.08] have neurological problems and no one
[932.80 - 935.20] realizes that they just think they're
[934.08 - 938.08] wimps
[935.20 - 938.08] they're not wimps
[938.72 - 942.24] meditation is difficult when you're
[940.24 - 944.08] suffering from bipolar or depression or
[942.24 - 945.60] anxiety or depersonalization or
[944.08 - 947.28] schizophrenia or whatever you're
[945.60 - 949.60] suffering from mentally and emotionally
[947.28 - 952.84] or just emotional injuries and ptsd if
[949.60 - 956.08] you're suffering from ptsd meditation is
[952.84 - 959.20] hell i know so many people who have ptsd
[956.08 - 961.12] and had ptsd and meditation was just
[959.20 - 962.56] total health for them
[961.12 - 963.92] because as they're trying to meditate
[962.56 - 965.92] all they see is the hell they've been
[963.92 - 967.60] through
[965.92 - 969.84] here appleman hey good to see you with
[967.60 - 971.52] brain fog it can be so hard to visualize
[969.84 - 973.28] or think about anything that's why
[971.52 - 976.24] sitting
[973.28 - 978.40] outside on the porch and just watching a
[976.24 - 981.04] beautiful bird a blue jay
[978.40 - 982.80] or anything go by
[981.04 - 985.12] is critical for meditating that's
[982.80 - 986.72] critical watching a bee hum around and
[985.12 - 988.16] land on a daily line is one of the most
[986.72 - 989.68] powerful meditations especially if
[988.16 - 991.76] you've been through a heck and tara

[999.76 - 1002.40] and you know
[1004.00 - 1009.20] meditations don't have to be grandiose
[1006.08 - 1009.20] they don't have to be
[1009.44 - 1013.20] this grandiose process
[1014.32 - 1018.00] meditations can be so powerful when
[1016.16 - 1020.00] they're just even small meditations
[1018.00 - 1022.72] while you're while you're suffering and
[1020.00 - 1025.20] trying to heal from panic and anxiety
[1022.72 - 1027.20] and depression and everything else

[1511.04 - 1513.92] death
[1512.16 - 1515.60] and then to come rising out of that
[1513.92 - 1518.00] using this information unless they've
[1515.60 - 1520.80] been there nobody knows
[1518.00 - 1522.56] people don't understand what someone
[1520.80 - 1524.00] else has been through unless they've
[1522.56 - 1525.28] been through it themselves and if they
[1524.00 - 1527.20] haven't been through it themselves they
[1525.28 - 1529.04] don't understand
[1527.20 - 1531.04] you become like this ghost to them like
[1529.04 - 1533.12] you're meaning your problem becomes like
[1531.04 - 1535.28] this ghost thing like is it real is it

[1540.40 - 1543.68] md
[1542.00 - 1545.60] problem with the bell would be that
[1543.68 - 1547.76] you'd be ringing it all the time and
[1545.60 - 1549.84] people would be like is that my tinnitus
[1547.76 - 1551.68] or the bell it's actually really funny
[1549.84 - 1553.36] another problem with the bell is i'd
[1551.68 - 1556.24] probably get really stupid with it and
[1553.36 - 1557.76] yeah i'd be ringing it all the time and
[1556.24 - 1559.20] i would probably just yeah you're right
[1557.76 - 1560.80] that's the problem i would get everybody
[1559.20 - 1562.16] upset

[1679.68 - 1685.76] organic this is wild
[1682.88 - 1687.20] these blueberry plants have seen
[1685.76 - 1690.16] everything
[1687.20 - 1694.08] they've seen indigenous cultures
[1690.16 - 1696.88] come by and feed off of them
[1694.08 - 1699.36] they've seen right
[1696.88 - 1703.52] indigenous cultures feeding off of them
[1699.36 - 1707.12] they've seen bears and deer and foxes
[1703.52 - 1711.40] and coyotes and animals come through and
[1707.12 - 1711.40] feed off of them right
[1711.84 - 1717.12] they've seen blazing hot sun they've
[1714.64 - 1719.28] seen freezing cold they've seen drought
[1717.12 - 1722.16] they've seen the ice age they've seen
[1719.28 - 1725.44] all of it they've seen mammoths
[1722.16 - 1729.12] these wild blueberry plants have seen
[1725.44 - 1732.56] mammoths walk around
[1729.12 - 1732.56] with big tusks
[1735.12 - 1739.92] these wild blueberries
[1736.84 - 1744.64] yeah these wild bloopers have seen
[1739.92 - 1744.64] aliens fly around and land
[1746.24 - 1753.72] they have these wild blueberry plants
[1748.40 - 1753.72] have seen aliens fly around and land
[1755.52 - 1761.44] right in the middle of the field
[1757.44 - 1765.32] and aliens get out of that craft
[1761.44 - 1765.32] and pick those blueberries
[1767.04 - 1771.20] these wild blueberry plants have seen
[1769.76 - 1773.68] all that people think i'm kidding i'm
[1771.20 - 1775.84] not kidding on that one ready for this
[1773.68 - 1779.60] these wild blueberry plants have seen
[1775.84 - 1782.56] sasquatches and bigfoots
[1779.60 - 1782.56] and nookie knox
[1783.20 - 1786.88] they've seen
[1785.68 - 1789.20] bigfoot
[1786.88 - 1791.20] lots of families of bigfoots throughout
[1789.20 - 1793.68] the ages
[1791.20 - 1795.60] how many bigfoots were feasting off of
[1793.68 - 1797.52] these in the fields these wild blueberry
[1795.60 - 1800.00] plants have seen and experienced
[1797.52 - 1802.24] sasquatches and bigfoots feeding off
[1800.00 - 1803.84] these wild blueberries
[1802.24 - 1805.60] and then they would go and disappear in
[1803.84 - 1807.12] the woods and then indigenous culture
[1805.60 - 1808.96] native americans other indigenous
[1807.12 - 1810.72] cultures would come in and feed off of
[1808.96 - 1812.96] those wild blueberries they would come
[1810.72 - 1814.88] and go and then the beer bears would
[1812.96 - 1816.56] come in and the grizzlies and the black
[1814.88 - 1818.80] bear would come in they'd feed off of
[1816.56 - 1820.64] them bears love that and they would feed
[1818.80 - 1822.96] off them and they would go
[1820.64 - 1824.80] walk away the alien crash would come and
[1822.96 - 1826.40] land and the aliens come out of the
[1824.80 - 1828.32] alien crafts in the middle of the night
[1826.40 - 1829.68] or the day and they would feed off those
[1828.32 - 1833.40] wild blueberries and go back in the
[1829.68 - 1833.40] craft and take off
[1836.08 - 1841.76] these plants have seen a lot you guys
[1839.36 - 1843.60] they've seen a lot
[1841.76 - 1845.04] and so that's important to know right
[1843.60 - 1846.88] there
[1845.04 - 1848.72] and it's more than just that they have
[1846.88 - 1851.12] survived
[1848.72 - 1854.00] they have adapted
[1851.12 - 1857.36] this is a wild food
[1854.00 - 1859.20] this is a food that takes care of itself
[1857.36 - 1861.76] when it takes care of itself it holds
[1859.20 - 1863.92] something holds something powerful and
[1861.76 - 1865.44] this stuff is high in manganese by the
[1863.92 - 1868.08] way
[1865.44 - 1869.20] extremely high in manganese making these
[1868.08 - 1873.44] is that
[1869.20 - 1875.60] that bridge builder trace mineral
[1873.44 - 1877.52] and it's high in this juice right it's
[1875.60 - 1879.60] high in the wild blueberry so
[1877.52 - 1881.68] people wonder like how do these
[1879.60 - 1883.60] antioxidants work well that manganese is
[1881.68 - 1885.92] part of how these antioxidants work and
[1883.60 - 1888.24] bridge that gap
[1885.92 - 1889.84] but the anthocyanins that blue color
[1888.24 - 1891.52] have to go somewhere so when you eat
[1889.84 - 1893.12] these wild blueberries you drink the
[1891.52 - 1894.64] juice you're getting straight i always
[1893.12 - 1897.28] say this is mainlining it right here
[1894.64 - 1898.88] this is direct fast into the bloodstream
[1897.28 - 1900.80] right so
[1898.88 - 1903.36] when it's the juice it's like right into
[1900.80 - 1905.52] the bloodstream fast right through the
[1903.36 - 1907.12] stomach walls right through the duodenum
[1905.52 - 1910.40] walls right through the intestinal tract
[1907.12 - 1911.84] and that's just going through you quick
[1910.40 - 1914.32] and then it gets into your bloodstream
[1911.84 - 1915.76] in that blue that blue color finds its
[1914.32 - 1918.80] way to where
[1915.76 - 1920.96] to the meditation center it finds its
[1918.80 - 1922.88] way to the meditation center that blue
[1920.96 - 1924.48] color finds its way to where the
[1922.88 - 1926.88] meditation
[1924.48 - 1928.96] is happening
[1926.88 - 1930.56] you can meditate
[1928.96 - 1933.76] fast
[1930.56 - 1936.00] anytime you want you can stop
[1933.76 - 1937.60] and you can see a squirrel
[1936.00 - 1939.92] and then you can just
[1937.60 - 1942.72] instantly believe
[1939.92 - 1945.60] i am that squirrel now
[1942.72 - 1947.20] and transport yourself through
[1945.60 - 1949.76] your thought process using your
[1947.20 - 1952.64] consciousness that you are that squirrel
[1949.76 - 1956.96] chewing on that nut on the tree that's a
[1952.64 - 1956.96] meditation in that moment real fast
[1957.92 - 1962.40] that quick
[1960.48 - 1965.84] you can shut your eyes and you can
[1962.40 - 1968.72] listen to the wind blow
[1965.84 - 1970.88] that's a meditation
[1968.72 - 1972.80] you can also go into a meditation center
[1970.88 - 1974.64] and mess around and play around with
[1972.80 - 1976.40] singing bowls and
[1974.64 - 1978.16] sit there and
[1976.40 - 1980.32] you do whatever you want but the point
[1978.16 - 1982.72] is what can help
[1980.32 - 1984.88] in the meditation centers what i've
[1982.72 - 1987.52] always heard from spirit of compassion
[1984.88 - 1988.96] is the blue color
[1987.52 - 1991.44] and i've been talking about this for
[1988.96 - 1994.96] over 30 years probably 40 years
[1991.44 - 1994.96] trying not to date me too much
[1995.12 - 1998.88] but i've been around for a while already
[1997.36 - 2001.68] on this planet
[1998.88 - 2003.36] i hope to be around longer
[2001.68 - 2005.04] by the way if something happens to me
[2003.36 - 2006.16] guys
[2005.04 - 2008.00] all right
[2006.16 - 2010.24] just saying
[2008.00 - 2011.84] something happens to me you know
[2010.24 - 2012.96] all right
[2011.84 - 2015.36] yeah
[2012.96 - 2016.96] anyway
[2015.36 - 2020.00] i'm just telling you i didn't kill
[2016.96 - 2022.48] myself or anything like that just
[2020.00 - 2024.00] letting you know
[2022.48 - 2028.40] or anything else
[2024.00 - 2028.40] something happens it wasn't an accident
[2028.56 - 2031.60] okay
[2029.44 - 2033.60] something happens to me and
[2031.60 - 2037.04] we lose me and they say it was an
[2033.60 - 2037.04] accident it wasn't an accident
[2037.92 - 2044.00] anyway out of there for a second
[2041.60 - 2045.44] the bottom line is it's what i'm trying
[2044.00 - 2046.64] to tell you
[2045.44 - 2049.04] okay
[2046.64 - 2051.36] is that that blue anthocyanin i've been
[2049.04 - 2053.60] talking about for well over three
[2051.36 - 2055.52] decades spirit of compassion has always
[2053.60 - 2060.12] told me it goes and it gets to the brain
[2055.52 - 2060.12] and it goes into a place
[2061.52 - 2065.76] in the emotional centers of the brain it
[2063.28 - 2068.64] goes into a place where the third eye is
[2065.76 - 2072.08] it goes into the place
[2068.64 - 2073.92] that harbors that energy source
[2072.08 - 2077.12] that supernatural force that we have
[2073.92 - 2079.84] inside our brains because we're not just
[2077.12 - 2082.88] physical brain matter and gray matter or
[2079.84 - 2085.36] supernatural force and soul so we're all
[2082.88 - 2087.44] that so that blue goes into that
[2085.36 - 2091.44] supernatural force and it goes into
[2087.44 - 2091.44] there into that area in the brain
[2093.04 - 2097.12] and it connects to the consciousness and
[2095.36 - 2099.76] subconsciousness to the soul into the
[2097.12 - 2101.60] supernatural force and that energy field
[2099.76 - 2104.00] and that electricity that's in our brain
[2101.60 - 2105.60] and around our brain that anthocyanin
[2104.00 - 2108.72] connects to that that's what spirit of
[2105.60 - 2111.92] compassion told me when i was a kid
[2108.72 - 2111.92] it connects to that
[2113.36 - 2116.72] and that's power
[2115.44 - 2118.48] from food
[2116.72 - 2120.48] i have heard over and over again people
[2118.48 - 2122.00] are like yeah i know food you could use
[2120.48 - 2125.12] food as medicine yeah but what kind of
[2122.00 - 2125.12] food are you talking about
[2126.00 - 2129.12] you talking about wild food because if
[2127.68 - 2130.16] you're not talking about wild food and
[2129.12 - 2131.52] you're not talking about wild
[2130.16 - 2133.52] blueberries and you're not talking about
[2131.52 - 2136.16] wild food then i don't know what you're
[2133.52 - 2138.40] talking about
[2136.16 - 2139.92] it's a big difference
[2138.40 - 2141.52] every time i talk about the wild
[2139.92 - 2143.28] blueberries someone goes out and buys a
[2141.52 - 2144.80] clam shell with the big cultivated
[2143.28 - 2146.08] blueberries in it it's like he told me
[2144.80 - 2147.84] blueberries are good for me and they
[2146.08 - 2150.08] dump them in there and i feel bad
[2147.84 - 2151.84] because i get it because we've also
[2150.08 - 2153.84] we've also been brainwashed about our
[2151.84 - 2155.92] food and our
[2153.84 - 2158.16] food sources out there and we're we're
[2155.92 - 2159.84] just not taught we just don't know we
[2158.16 - 2161.92] don't know there's a difference between
[2159.84 - 2163.76] wild and then everybody and then the
[2161.92 - 2165.92] organic police come in and start
[2163.76 - 2167.84] freaking out and say well why isn't
[2165.92 - 2169.36] wyman's organic and they don't even
[2167.84 - 2172.00] realize
[2169.36 - 2173.52] that wild is above organic and they
[2172.00 - 2175.84] don't even know wilde doesn't love
[2173.52 - 2178.72] organic they don't know that and that's
[2175.84 - 2181.52] a whole sad thing all on its own
[2178.72 - 2183.04] i talked about that the other day
[2181.52 - 2185.36] people think
[2183.04 - 2187.44] organic is holy
[2185.36 - 2189.84] holy
[2187.44 - 2192.16] can't do no wrong
[2189.84 - 2193.92] you know like holy and
[2192.16 - 2196.00] godly
[2193.92 - 2197.84] they don't realize yeah we have to eat
[2196.00 - 2200.08] organic food heck yeah but they don't
[2197.84 - 2202.00] realize that organic foods loaded with
[2200.08 - 2204.56] copper spray and
[2202.00 - 2206.48] nicotine spray to kill the pollinators
[2204.56 - 2208.48] and kill the they don't know what kills
[2206.48 - 2209.84] the pollinators it kills the pollinators
[2208.48 - 2213.68] and
[2209.84 - 2214.96] organic is it all crapped up to be
[2213.68 - 2216.40] right
[2214.96 - 2218.72] wild food
[2216.40 - 2220.64] right doesn't need to be cared for so
[2218.72 - 2222.40] what happens is that you barely spray
[2220.64 - 2225.20] ever you can go years without spraying a
[2222.40 - 2227.28] wild food source meanwhile organic farms
[2225.20 - 2228.56] are actually they're organic farms are
[2227.28 - 2229.36] conventional farms did you guys know
[2228.56 - 2231.68] that
[2229.36 - 2234.72] organic farms came after conventional
[2231.68 - 2237.44] produce conventional farms organic farm
[2234.72 - 2239.76] owners companies organic farm companies
[2237.44 - 2243.44] bought conventional farmland and started
[2239.76 - 2246.64] planting the stuff the soil saturated
[2243.44 - 2248.32] with pesticides and chemicals
[2246.64 - 2250.16] and so people don't realize they're
[2248.32 - 2252.48] growing all their organic food out of
[2250.16 - 2254.96] pesticide-ridden soil
[2252.48 - 2257.44] meanwhile a wild food gets sprayed so
[2254.96 - 2258.96] very little and the soil was never
[2257.44 - 2262.00] sprayed to begin with from a
[2258.96 - 2264.40] conventional farm so it's pure soil down
[2262.00 - 2265.84] there they don't get this beverly says
[2264.40 - 2269.96] what are we going to do with all of
[2265.84 - 2269.96] these shortages going on
[2271.36 - 2274.72] that's the whole point like i'm talking
[2273.20 - 2276.72] about a wild food
[2274.72 - 2278.88] look i got my freezer stocked with some
[2276.72 - 2280.64] wild blueberries
[2278.88 - 2282.24] that's one thing i got and i'm stocked
[2280.64 - 2283.36] with the wild blueberry juice right
[2282.24 - 2287.36] there
[2283.36 - 2290.00] because i've gone without food
[2287.36 - 2292.96] and just sip this along the way every
[2290.00 - 2296.56] day all day for days sandra says where
