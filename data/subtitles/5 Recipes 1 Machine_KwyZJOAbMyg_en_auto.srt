00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:57,059
through here take a look so that is the

23
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:58,559
puree baby food yams you could do

24
00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:02,219
carrots you're gonna do some wheatgrass

25
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:04,739
right now so I have right here the end

26
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:06,720
cap for the wheatgrass this is the 1500s

27
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:09,180
known to save you money because it's got

28
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,340
that celery end cap you can't extract

29
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:13,439
this kind of wheatgrass juice from other

30
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:16,080
juicers I know I've seen it out there

31
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:19,140
you're looking at how dry the pulp is

32
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,820
the wheatgrass pole other juicers they

33
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:22,619
don't do that it's got its own little

34
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,180
strainer on top of it I'll show you this

35
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:26,900
which is incredible about the juicer the

36
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,900
mm-1500

37
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,979
making some Walnut milk right here and

38
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:33,240
what I'm going to do is add water in

39
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:36,299
here

40
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:39,479
now these are soaked walnuts just so you

41
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:41,040
know the nuts are soaked overnight yes

42
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:43,700
that's what I like to do when I'm making

43
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,439
a nut milk now this machine really

44
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:49,200
pulverizes you can actually take this

45
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:51,479
the froth over here and you can actually

46
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,399
take that off so you do a little bit of

47
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:56,280
a mix to it

48
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:58,320
so I'm making a salsa right now so I'm

49
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:01,439
dropping tomato and I'm dropping some

50
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,060
onion in here I put a lime in here too a

51
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,939
little bit of cilantro

52
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:07,799
drop in some jalapeno in there now so

53
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:10,140
what you do is you take this part here

54
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:12,780
you mix it in here like this

55
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:15,120
so what I'm doing is I'm mixing this up

56
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:17,459
this one's a little hotter so what I'm

57
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,540
doing right now is I'm making a walnut

58
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:20,459
butter

59
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:23,520
it's like sticks of butter

60
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:26,520
but Walnut butter butter you buy they

61
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:29,280
add a ton of oil there wasn't four

62
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:32,099
ounces of oil added into this it's the

63
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,060
mm 1500 and that's what it does eighty

64
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:35,700
dollars off and you know what's

65
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:39,540
incredible about this right now

66
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:41,879
80 off and you get a free cleanse to

67
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:45,620
heal book with it which is really cool

68
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:45,620
so I'm excited about that all on its own
