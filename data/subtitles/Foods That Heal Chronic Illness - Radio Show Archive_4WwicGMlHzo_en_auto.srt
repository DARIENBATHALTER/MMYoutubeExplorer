radio show where each week I talk about

the most advanced healing information

8
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,840
and secrets about health much of which

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,840
is not found anywhere else and is

10
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:33,840
decades ahead of what's out there now as

11
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:36,399
I've always said who is 10 or 20 or 30

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,960
even 30 years to wait for answers and

13
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,879
I've seen it before and I see it now

14
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,160
it's going on out there I talked to

15
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:45,239
people and they're like you know it took

16
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:47,520
30 years to know that Epstein bar

17
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:49,520
actually causes heart palpitations no

18
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,000
one knew that it didn't exist out there

19
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,320
the information did not exist out there

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,239
and it took 30 years to figure out that

21
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,359
epscene bar causes tingles and numbness

22
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:01,519
and that didn't exist it took 30 years

23
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:05,040
for this person person to find out that

24
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:08,000
Epstein causes anxiety and depression

25
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:12,360
chronic depression long term and brain

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,119
fog nobody knew it never was anywhere

27
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,040
else but here and that's thanks to

28
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,520
Spirit so thank you for actually tuning

29
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,920
in everybody because we're helping out

30
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:22,720
so many people by getting the

31
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,240
information finally out there because we

32
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,200
don't have time to waste we don't have

33
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:29,040
time to just hang out we don't have

34
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:32,240
another 30 years to know that Epstein

35
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,680
bar causes Hashimoto's thyroiditis and

36
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:37,200
although this isn't an Epstein bar show

37
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,640
today we're talking about foods that

38
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,479
heal chronic illness and of course

39
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:44,399
Epstein bar causes a lot of chronic

40
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:46,840
illness so does a lot of other bugs and

41
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,640
pathogens that we talk about like strap

42
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,960
and everything else and you know and

43
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,759
other types of pathogens and of course

44
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,439
we talk about the toxic heavy metals and

45
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:57,719
other things associated with chronic

46
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:59,600
illness but the point is today we're

47
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:01,520
talking about foods that heal chronic

48
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,840
illness illness so we might tap into

49
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,479
some of these other chronic illnesses

50
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,080
and what we deal with every day so

51
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,200
there's no time to waste no time to

52
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,959
spare fasten the seat belts we're

53
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:18,480
starting today so today's show is about

54
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:19,959
the Holy four the holy four okay right I

55
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,680
talked to you before about the

56
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:24,800
unforgiving four right the unforgiving

57
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,560
four which is the pesticides and

58
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,879
herbicides that are in our system for

59
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:33,120
years like DDT included all the way back

60
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:37,840
toxic heavy metals Mercury lead arsenic

61
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:40,200
you know um cadmium um nickel copper we

62
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,519
you know we talked about that and you

63
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,560
aluminum and then we talked about the

64
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:46,360
radiation how much radiation still

65
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,560
falling out on us how much radiation is

66
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,640
going on there and there's nothing to

67
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:51,159
worry about in the sense where hey we

68
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,959
got all this stuff going on that's not

69
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:55,560
about it it's about

70
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:59,959
knowing what could be hampering your

71
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:03,080
immune system and what we can do to stop

72
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:06,159
it fight it clean it up get it out of

73
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:10,239
your system instead of just playing the

74
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:12,640
game like hey everything's fine sure 250

75
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:15,120
million Americans are sick almost 300

76
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:18,000
million Americans have symptoms

77
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,360
unexplained completely mystery but let's

78
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,720
just pretend everything's okay you know

79
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,120
we're not going to do that all right

80
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:25,519
we're not going to do that because I

81
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,599
know if you got a symptom and you got

82
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,519
something going on and you got a chronic

83
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:32,120
illness you want answers um no one wants

84
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:34,040
to be sick you know one thing I know

85
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,879
I'll tell you guys right now and and you

86
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:39,439
probably know this better than I do no

87
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:42,640
one wants to be sick you know and there

88
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:45,720
isn't such thing as a fear of

89
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:50,000
healing but what there is is there's a

90
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:52,599
fear of being sick that's for sure so we

91
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,120
do have that out there that's rampant

92
00:03:52,599 --> 00:04:01,120
there is a fear of being sick so that

93
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:04,360
does exist okay but nobody has a fear of

94
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:06,000
healing all right so that right there is

95
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:08,120
something we have to always understand

96
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,280
you no one wants a tummy ache no one

97
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:12,439
wants a tummy ache nobody wants a

98
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:15,239
headache does anybody want a headache

99
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:18,280
out there does anybody want a tummy ache

100
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:20,600
does any I'm actually being a little

101
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:23,040
extra uh annoying today is that what it

102
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:26,040
is silly a little extra silly nobody

103
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,080
wants to have an ache and pain right I

104
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:30,560
mean come on and so and I'm serious

105
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:33,880
about this no one wants

106
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:38,240
fatigue so we can't just

107
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:40,639
gloss everything over as if you know hey

108
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,479

that's what we're doing sending light

156
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:35,400
down from heaven Spirit does this for me

157
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,000
thank goodness since I was a child and I

158
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:39,360
talk about this before you guys heard me

159
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,800
say this before I was worried about what

160
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,800
else can I do back when I was younger

161
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,800
what can I do to help somebody and

162
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,960
spirit said we're going to do the light

163
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:50,080
and spirit taught me how to be involved

164
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:51,960
why Spirit sends the light down on the

165
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,880
crown of everybody's head and we do this

166
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:56,000
at the event rushes through the body

167
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:57,919
unblocks energy that's stored up that

168
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,120
people have from just being sick and not

169
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:02,479
feeling well and they get all stagnant

170
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,960
and and you know and get all acidic and

171
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,080
everybody just you because when you're

172
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:08,120
sick and unwell it's really difficult we

173
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,599
go through struggles and we don't feel

174
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,520
good we don't feel at our best and we

175
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:13,039
feel tired and everything just builds up

176
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,680
and then we have all these kinds of

177
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:17,120
struggles and emotional um struggles

178
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,479
that we do because there's so much

179
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,120
stress and everything else going on in

180
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:23,080
the world and in our lives and it gets

181
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,680
built up and on top of that we have our

182
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:26,560
condition itself and the and the cause

183

00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,639
that's what we're doing about and I'm

207
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,599
talking about life-changing Foods

208
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,919
because of the book because we're

209
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:27,280
talking about the Holy four because

210
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:30,680
that's in there we talked about the

211
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:32,320
unforgiving four that's in the book and

212
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:34,320
I can't even scratch the surface of

213
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,039
what's in life-changing Foods book I

214
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,959
can't even scratch the surface I could

215
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:40,399
do 50 shows and won't scratch the

216
00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:42,919
surface in there um and you know so I'm

217
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:45,920
going to try to get what I can out in

218
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:47,080
this show but um it it's really

219
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,399
difficult what I'm saying is when you

220
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,959
get the book and you get it in your hand

221
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,440

225
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:01,079
hype or something and then you open up

226
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:03,200

an importance to it do you think there's

240

some kind of importance to it yeah there

241
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:43,839
really is there really is but it's more

242
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,920
than just you know just maybe a little

243
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:50,240
bit of broccoli once a week it's more

244
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:52,040
than an apple once a month I was talking

245
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,040
to somebody the other day cuz I have to

246
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:56,040
talk to so many different people and I

247
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:57,680
was talking to someone and they said um

248
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:00,360
and they said look you know I eat apples

249
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,399

this apples do this apples do this and

257
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,399

had an apple last month and it was

268
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,680
really well I think it might have been

269
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,240
more than one apple I said that's

270
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:44,839
amazing you had more than one apple and

271
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:47,320
this person said yeah because it was in

272
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:51,760
it was an apple tart this homemade apple

273
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:54,200
tart I said okay hold on hold on okay

274
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:56,240
I'm back up here so wait a minute you

275
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:58,399
didn't have an apple and chop it up and

276
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:01,320
eat it in slices or put a little almond

277
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,519
butter on it or put a little or put a

278
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,480
little peanut butter on it if that's

279
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:06,440
what you like or put you know whatever

280
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:09,680
it is Apple goes good with avocado by

281
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:13,040
the way if you put avocado on an Apple

282
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:15,360
slice that tastes really good I'm just

283
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,200
I'm just being straight um anyway so

284
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,600
they go no it was in a tart it was in a

285
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,600
healthy tart it was at I was at this

286
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:23,360
health food store and they had these

287
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:24,519
apple tarts and uh I said well what what

288
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,240
else was in it they said well was

289
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:28,800
glutenfree I said so you sure there was

290
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,639
that much apple in there I go first of

291
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,399
all okay your Apple was cooked which is

292
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:33,800
not the endend of the world okay fine if

293
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,800
that's what you know it's still got

294
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:39,839
medicinal qualities applesauce still has

295
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:42,440
Med medicinal qualities I go so it was

296
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:44,760
this tart you go okay you had probably

297
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:47,639
like a half an apple in that tart the

298
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:50,440
rest was batter you know bread

299
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:53,920
gluten-free bread and probably regular

300
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:56,720
sugar probably canola oil you know

301
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:59,040
because canola oil is bad and um and

302
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,720
regular sugar like table Sugar's bad and

303
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:03,600
and and so and and this person was like

304
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,959
yeah I guess you're right I I just first

305
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,720
I was really excited it was an apple

306
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:09,360
tart it I was all Apple I go look look

307
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:12,399
I'm not trying to pick on you but we got

308
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:16,120
to get an Apple in you every day and

309
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:19,760
maybe two apples a day because you got a

310
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:21,760
liver problem and you got inflammation

311
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:24,160
caused by you know pathogens and other

312
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:27,360
things going on in the body you got to

313
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:29,240
get two apples in a day because that's

314
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:32,040
when it starts to happen that's when the

315
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:34,639
magic starts to happen it's the numbers

316
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:36,079
it's the numbers and that's why someone

317
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:37,519
said to me another time and said well

318
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:39,000
you don't like you know animal products

319
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,880
like that's not about it it's not what

320
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,360
it is has nothing to do with that it's

321
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,920
about what food that's going to help the

322
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:46,120
person the most for what condition they

323
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:49,639
have so if that means minimizing animal

324
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:51,720
products because you need room for two

325
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:53,720
apples three apples a day to clean up

326
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:56,720
your liver does that mean I hate

327
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:59,160
something no it just means I'm telling

328
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,880
you what you need to do because I I got

329
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:03,040
your back on this and I'm telling you

330
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:05,720
what you need to do and get you to where

331
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,079
you need to be and so and they're like

332
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:09,360
okay okay that makes sense I didn't

333
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:10,880
think about it that way so anyway back

334
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,120
to this other person he said look we got

335
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:16,079
to do better than this apple tart I mean

336
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:19,399
a jar of applesauce would be better than

337
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:20,680
that apple tart so the bottom line is

338
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:24,240
you know we're told to eat are fruits

339
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:26,199
and vegetables but we're not really

340
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:29,600
eating our fruits and vegetables and

341
00:13:26,199 --> 00:13:31,480
it's not our fault it's not your fault

342
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,959
it's not my fault if I can't get enough

343
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:35,000
vegetables in one day cuz I'm running

344
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:37,079
around like a you know a crazy person

345
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,279
because I got so much on my plate or I'm

346
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:40,639
traveling or something and I can't get

347
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:43,760
enough vegetables it's not I mean it's

348
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:46,079
not our fault we do the best we can but

349
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:48,839
we but but what we have to do is we just

350
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:51,279
have to be more mindful about what when

351
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:52,920
we're eating what we're eating and some

352
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,240
people they just hate that and I totally

353
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:56,199
get it they're just like I don't want to

354
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,120
know what I'm eating I talk to people

355
00:13:56,199 --> 00:14:00,079
and some people go I don't want to know

356
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:02,440
what I'm eating I don't care what I'm

357
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:06,240
eating I just you know it's just I got

358
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:08,120
busy life I got a busy life I just you

359
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,639
know if I can get a good meal here and

360
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:12,680

that's just rolling around that's

371
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,680
spinning around and you know and I get

372
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,519
it if you got to just grab food to food

374
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:44,600
you're trying to take care of your

375
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:48,360
family and you're running around and you

376
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:50,199
got things going on I respect that I got

377
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:53,079
respect for anything you got to do in

378
00:14:50,199 --> 00:14:55,880
your life okay and anything you've gone

379
00:14:53,079 --> 00:14:58,800
through okay and that's one thing that I

380
00:14:55,880 --> 00:15:00,480
have and um because you have to have

381
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,079
have that you have to have that I talk

382
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,880
to people and they don't even they they

383
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:07,560
just don't understand uh what someone

384
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,759
else is going through and and it's sad

385
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,000
because you know when you try to tell

386
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:11,440
them you got to go look this person's

387
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,839
going through a lot and they go well I

388
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,360

that's not true they didn't cause it and

391
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,399
they're going through a lot and we got

392
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:23,120
to respect that and it's critical to to

393
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:24,639
respect that so if you can't get the

394
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,399

00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:19,319

447
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:25,160
stuff and it it would be like you know

448
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:29,080
it's that kind of thing A friend of mine

449
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:32,000
is um a sports expert and he's just like

450
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:33,919
Rambles off and rattles off uh batting

451
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,440
averages and everything else and he said

452
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,000
you he said at first you know he just

453
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,559
got into it it was just kind of a hobby

454
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,039
he caught a couple of games couple of

455
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,480
football games couple of baseball games

456
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:44,039
couple of soccer games and and then he

457
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,600
says you know it was just like a Pastime

458
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:47,039
little hobby a past time was a little

459
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,640
bit of a passion and he said he got

460
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:51,360
really into it and now he's like an

461
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:54,039
expert he he went from one point of it

462
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:56,520
to hey you know he can ramble off

463
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:58,559
everything strategies that you know uh

464
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:00,720
sports teams use you name it in this

465
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:03,400
stuff just spins my head cuz I I don't

466
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,400
know anything about that so so you know

467
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:07,520
but but he be he you know became this

468
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:09,880
expert at it and then then a belief

469
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:12,280
system gets built up within it so a

470
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:14,640
belief system gets built up within it

471
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:17,200
and it's like it's there you know it

472
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:20,760
it's just they can't penetrate that

473
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:22,679
belief system so when I say to them now

474
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:24,360
you know I'll say look is is is this

475
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:26,200
team better than this team because they

476
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:28,559
got this going on and go like no no no

477
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:30,720
that's not possible I'll be like why

478
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:32,240
like no no it's not possible because of

479
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,440
this this this and this I said well okay

480
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,880
you got a strong belief system on that

481
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,080
he says well maybe I do maybe you're

482
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,480
right maybe I got to look at the other

483
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:41,440
team and see what they got going on

484
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:43,360
better and so what happens is we fall

485
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,039
into these belief systems we come we

486
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:48,960
become experts we get a passion to start

487
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:51,280
with and then bam we got a powerful

488
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:55,360
belief system Spirit told me when I was

489
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:58,520
young to not hold the belief system when

490
00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:01,880
it comes to one thing okay when when it

491
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:03,600
comes to one thing okay because I had a

492
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:06,360
belief system when I was 11 years old I

493
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:09,360
like these model airplanes and you know

494
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:12,200
and I I got interested because of a

495
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,760
friend and you know and the friend had

496
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,320
him and I was like whoa this is really

497
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,880
cool you got all these different planes

498
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:19,679
this is really cool I get it and so it

499
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:22,799
was getting interested in it and it was

500
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:24,480
building a belief system to all about it

501
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:27,240
and spirit said that's fine you can have

502
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,000
a belief system about certain things but

503
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,640
one thing you can't have have one in I

504
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,240
said what is it and spirit said you

505
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:36,320
can't have a belief system in health you

506
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:39,080
can't have a belief system in health in

507
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:41,480
health I said really what does that mean

508
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:43,400
I was in shock when I was young and

509
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:45,000
spirit was telling me this and I was

510
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:47,000
like okay you know you know Spirit

511
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,559
you're going to give me OCD on this what

512
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,840
do you mean you're going to have to

513
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:55,799
explain this because I believe in health

514
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:58,520
I believe in healing I believe in

515
00:19:55,799 --> 00:20:01,679
anything health related what do you mean

516
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:04,720
I shouldn't have a belief system in

517
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:06,000
health and spirit said you have to keep

518
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,400
open

519
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,600
because all the modalities have

520
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:13,360
something to

521
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:17,080
offer all the diets have something to

522
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:20,200
offer but you can't have a belief system

523
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:23,600
to just one thing because there's never

524
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:27,600
just one thing wrong with all of us and

525
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:33,480
there's never just one thing that fixes

526
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:37,320
all of us us and there's never just one

527
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:41,640
belief in health or one modality only or

528
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:44,480
one thing in health only that can help

529
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:49,960
us and spirit said you can't have a

530
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:51,400
belief system in one type of diet one

531
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:54,120
type of

532
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:56,919
diet and you can't have and the spirit

533
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:59,480
was teaching me this I was like whoa

534
00:20:56,919 --> 00:21:02,720
okay okay I I know I I know what you're

535
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:05,960
saying because spirit said that the

536
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:08,400
experts behind their one belief

537
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:12,679
system will tell

538
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:15,799
you that kale is bad for your

539
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:17,240
thyroid when they're wrong and kale is

540
00:21:15,799 --> 00:21:20,240
good for your

541
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:24,360
thyroid okay because and here's here's

542
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:27,840
how it goes the experts don't know that

543
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:31,840
Epstein bar causes Hashimoto thyroiditis

544
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:33,440
in until I released medical medium book

545
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,320
and now they're starting to pick up on

546
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,039
that they're not giving me credit but

547
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:40,240
that doesn't matter who cares but the

548
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:45,440
point is is at least the information's

549
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:49,640
getting out there but kale okay kale

550
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:52,880
kills off Epstein bar virus in the

551
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:54,279
thyroid it kills the Epstein bar virus

552
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,960
in the

553
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:58,559
thyroid so meanwhile the food experts

554
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,320
the belief system experts think that

555
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:01,880
kale is you know goitrogenic compounds

556
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,840
in there hurts your thyroid you can't

557
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:06,640
eat it so they tell you don't eat it and

558
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:08,159
then it becomes a belief system and then

559
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,960
you're stuck you can't eat anything in

560
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:11,559
that family you can't eat the broccoli

561
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:13,240
you can't eat the cauliflower right you

562
00:22:11,559 --> 00:22:15,039

563
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:16,960
compounds hurting your thyroid you can't

00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:18,919
eat kale you can't eat you know collar

565
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:21,159

566
00:22:18,919 --> 00:22:24,000
can't eat kale sprouts you can't eat bok

567
00:22:21,159 --> 00:22:26,240
choy you can't eat anything okay you

568
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,480
can't eat radishes you can't eat

569
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,919
anything and even some other Foods

570
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:33,039
they've even added foods to the list now

571
00:22:30,919 --> 00:22:36,000
that they think are that that they think

572
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:39,279
messing around with the thyroid and so

573
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,679
they got other Foods in the list now and

574
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:44,520
it becomes a belief system and guess

575
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:46,880
what it becomes poisonous meaning the

576
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:50,679
belief system is poisonous and guess who

577
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:52,760
it hurts it hurts us our children their

578
00:22:50,679 --> 00:22:55,320
children their children and their

579
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:56,960
children keeps on going we can go 100

580
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:59,640
years from this with this bad belief

581
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:02,679
system so we can go 100 years and this

582
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:04,520
is just one bad belief system okay see

583
00:23:02,679 --> 00:23:06,640
how it works and spirit taught me when I

584
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:09,799
was young and said look you know you got

585
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:11,640
to understand this belief system thing

586
00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:14,799
you know you got to you got to you got

587
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:17,159
to know this and and I said okay you

588
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:18,320
know what all right fine and spirit said

589
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:19,559
okay you want to have a belief system

590
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,679
for something else you want to have a

591
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:22,760
belief system for anything else that's

592
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:26,559
going

593
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:29,360
on fine but not in this field not in

594
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:32,360
this field not in alternative medicine

595
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:35,520
not in health not in the well-being of

596
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:37,840
others okay I said so I said to Spirit

597
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:39,640
can I have just one belief system in

598
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:42,320
health and spirit said what would that

599
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:44,520
be I said cuz I have one in Mind and

600
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:47,080
Spirit said what would that be Anthony

601
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:49,360
and I said I believe that everybody can

602
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:52,200
heal and I can

603
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:56,360
believe that that not only that they can

604
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:59,360
heal but they can rise above rise out of

605
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:02,320
it move forward with their

606
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:03,799
life and and get better and reclaim

607
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,400
their life back and get their life back

608
00:24:03,799 --> 00:24:08,080
spirit said I like that belief system so

609
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:11,520
I kind of was trying to one up Spirit

610
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:14,159
there spirit said that's great okay but

611
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,880
the bottom line is you guys you got your

612
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:18,039
bottom line is when it comes down to

613
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:21,400
meaning like a protocol or a not a

614
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:24,200
protocol but like a exactly like a a

615
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:25,480
regime the problem is when it comes down

616
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,880
to chronic illness and we're talking

617
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:29,080
about the Holy four fruits and

618
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:32,360
vegetables herbs and

619
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:35,799
spices okay wild Foods we're talking

620
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:38,240
about those the holy four that helps get

621
00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:40,080
rid of the unforgiving four that I talk

622
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,000
about in life- changing Foods when it

623
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:44,440
comes down to those there's going to be

624
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,360
Foods in this Foods in this holy for

625
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:49,000
like

626
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:52,440
kale that actually cleans up your

627
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:54,159
thyroid and helps you recover from

628
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:56,480
hypothyroidism and

629
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:58,279
Hashimoto and other thyroid conditions

630
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:01,279
and thyroid disease

631
00:24:58,279 --> 00:25:03,919
and the belief system that experts are

632
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:06,039
actually creating right now which is you

633
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,720
don't eat kale for your thyroid is

634
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:10,200
detrimental you'll even see it now

635
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:12,159
unlike shows on TV you'll see it

636
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:14,039
anywhere now it's it's really getting

637
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:18,640
out of control and that's a poisonous

638
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:21,399
belief system so we have to be cautious

639
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:24,720
about that it's really important now

640
00:25:21,399 --> 00:25:28,120
here's where it goes wrong experts in

641
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:30,760
health don't know what causes a th thid

642
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:33,679
problem until of course you know we we

643
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:35,760
published medical medium but they they

644
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:38,880
didn't know was wrong with the thyroid

645
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:41,000
problem so to offer to offer information

646
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,320
and say that kale will hurt your thyroid

647
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,640
when they don't even know what causes a

648
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:47,360
thyroid problem is where it all goes

649
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,919
wrong and so that's why we're here today

650
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,640
that's why we're here today to do this

651
00:25:48,919 --> 00:25:52,320
and make sure the information is right

652
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:55,480
make sure that you have everything you

653
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:58,120
can to heal everything in your hands all

654
00:25:55,480 --> 00:26:00,240
that you need and that that's what it's

655
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:01,720
about this is just one example of what

656
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,679
I'm trying to talk about now I talk

657
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:07,679
about the 880,000 meals I I know broken

658
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:09,240
record broken record just say it um I

659
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:11,840
probably sound like a broken record

660
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:14,960
right there I could take it I could take

661
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:17,520
it you can tell me okay but the 80,000

662
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:21,279
meals that I talk about all the time in

663
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:22,960
a lifetime if we didn't eat enough meals

664
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:25,520
because in a whole lifetime we might

665
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,360
have close to 80,000 meals 990,000 meals

666
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:30,520
70,000 meals depending on what's going

667
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:34,320
on depending on what's Happening and So

668
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:37,399
within those average meals of an average

669
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:38,919
lifetime let's just say we have to make

670
00:26:37,399 --> 00:26:41,360
sure that some of these meals start

671
00:26:38,919 --> 00:26:44,799
getting better so if we did half our

672
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:46,720
life and 40,000 meals were up subpar

673
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:49,120
they just weren't that great they were

674
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,600
you know um many of them were bad many

675
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:52,399
of them were processed foods many of

676
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:55,240
them were poisonous many of them were

677
00:26:52,399 --> 00:26:56,840
over fatty foods fried foods you know

678
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:58,679
all the stuff that you know that isn't

679
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:01,960
great right

680
00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:04,000
and so if half of that

681
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:05,679
lifetime was that then we got some

682
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,720
making up to do and that's what I like

683
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:10,279
about the Holy four because we got to

684
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:12,919
start making up our meals and that's the

685
00:27:10,279 --> 00:27:16,120
plan too and you can go far with that

686
00:27:12,919 --> 00:27:19,720
you can do some serious makeup serious

687
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:22,159
makeup and really move forward with that

688
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:24,320
so one thing to understand too which is

689
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:27,120
really great is all the different body

690
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:29,039
systems we have a lot of different body

691
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:31,159
systems you got the endocrine system

692
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:33,600
lymphatic system okay neurological

693
00:27:31,159 --> 00:27:37,440
system reproductive system it goes on

694
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:39,919
and on and on there's more than that so

695
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:43,679
within all the different body systems

696
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:46,519
that we have okay they do different

697
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:49,120
things and they need different things so

698
00:27:46,519 --> 00:27:51,360
we need some varieties so we need some

699
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,760
varieties in our Foods so when I was

700
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,880
talking about you talking to that person

701
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:56,840

00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:41,399
turkey sandwich before the apple tart I

722
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:43,159
said okay and then it it keeps on going

723
00:28:41,399 --> 00:28:45,360
on and I'm like you know what there's

724
00:28:43,159 --> 00:28:48,720
just no room there's no room to put

725
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:50,120
anything in there that you need the

726
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,919
things that you need the fruits and

727
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:56,679
vegetables you need and the holy

728
00:28:52,919 --> 00:29:00,039
four and that's what we're talking about

729
00:28:56,679 --> 00:29:01,760
today think about in your your food

730
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:04,440
regime and this doesn't mean you have to

731
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:06,840
feel bad let me tell you something life

732
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:09,000
gets crazy it gets busy we get habits

733
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:10,760
habits are developed because we we just

734
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,039
they just happen it happen because we

735
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:15,159
got so much on our plate and we're just

736
00:29:12,039 --> 00:29:16,640
doing what we got to do but think about

737
00:29:15,159 --> 00:29:20,200
you know where's the fruits and

738
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:23,360
vegetables where's the herbs and spices

739
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:25,159
you know where is the wild food that

740
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,679
might be in your plate if you're doing

741
00:29:25,159 --> 00:29:28,360
the wild blueberries the Frozen wild

742
00:29:26,679 --> 00:29:30,519
blueberries one a day that's your wild

743
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:32,799
food and by the way that's a fruit too

744
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:34,480
of course and a wild food so you got

745
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:37,440
something going on there you got

746
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:39,760
something going on there right there

747
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:42,360
it's the it's the Frozen wild

748
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:44,440
blueberries recently too I was talking

749
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:46,640
to a couple of people and they were like

750
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:48,799
you know I don't get the wild blueberry

751
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:50,679
part I just like the you know the

752
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:52,399
blueberries they're aren't they all the

753
00:29:50,679 --> 00:29:54,120
same it's blueberries they're not the

754
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:56,919
same the cultivated blueberry and the

755
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:59,720
Half Pint clamshell at the supermarket

756
00:29:56,919 --> 00:30:01,760
in the produce section is a very weak

757
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:03,320
food even though it's a good food for

758
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,760
you don't get me wrong if that's all you

759
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:06,600
got you better eat those regular

760
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:08,399
cultivated blueberries but it's a weak

761
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:11,320
food compared to the Frozen wild

762
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:13,960
blueberry right down the aisle and

763
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:15,720
that's make that makes up that makes up

764
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:18,200
for all the processed food meals you

765
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:20,880
might have eaten it starts to make it up

766
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:24,000
when you have that Frozen wild

767
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:25,399
blueberry every day and that stuff is

768
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
pulling out those blueberries have

769
00:30:25,399 --> 00:30:28,559
antioxidants phytochemicals that are

770
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
pulling out toxic heavy metals out of

771
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:32,039
your brain so you don't get Alzheimer's

772
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,440
disease so you don't get Parkinson's

773
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:35,519
disease so you don't get dementia so you

774
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:38,799
don't get memory

775
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:41,120
loss okay so you don't get brain tumors

776
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:42,840
so you don't get you know um so you

777
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,360
don't get cancers in the brain so you

778
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:46,080
don't get tumors in the brain so you

779
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:49,159
don't get you know you know adenomas in

780
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:51,760
the brain you know pituitary cysts and

781
00:30:49,159 --> 00:30:53,760
when you're doing those wild blueberries

782
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:56,159
Frozen wild blueberries you're making up

783
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:57,960
for years and years of processed food

784
00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:00,760
and or just poor quality quity food or

785
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:03,679
food that just didn't have any real high

786
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:05,880
nutrient value say it's not processed

787
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:07,919
say it's home-cooked meals say it's very

788
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:09,360
good wholesome whole homecooked meals

789
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:12,200
but it's the same thing it's chicken

790
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:13,440
every night for 30 years I'm not saying

791
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:15,639
you know chicken's the worst thing in

792
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:19,039
the world I'm saying that it doesn't

793
00:31:15,639 --> 00:31:22,320
have a lot of nutrients to make up for

794
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:26,960
the loss of all the nutrients so we need

795
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:29,279
to make room for more of that you know

796
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:31,360
and I got this feeling that's that's

797
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:33,159
pretty much what happened with the Paleo

798
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:36,399
movement the Paleo movement was just

799
00:31:33,159 --> 00:31:38,639
just just butter tons of butter tons of

800
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:40,840
pork tons of bacon and there's still

801
00:31:38,639 --> 00:31:42,960
some of that out there and you know tons

802
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:45,000
of chicken tons of turkey and tons of

803
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:48,159
meat and the Paleo movement's now moving

804
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:50,399
to lots of fruits and vegetables with

805
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:53,720
lower amounts of meat and I was talking

806
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:55,960
to a Paleo expert recently and I said

807
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:57,919
well why are you doing that and I said

808
00:31:55,960 --> 00:32:00,200
because we're seeing people get better

809
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:02,320
more and I said so what did you see in

810
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:04,080
the past and this paleo expert said to

811
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:06,240
said to me well I saw in the past 5

812
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:08,399
years ago when I got into the Paleo

813
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,440
movement when I got into it 5 years ago

814
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:12,399
I was all excited because it took away

815
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:14,639
processed foods this is a really a

816
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:16,120
really unknown paleo expert actually and

817
00:32:14,639 --> 00:32:18,000
he he was being honest with me and he

818
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:20,880
was saying look when I got into it

819
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,679
Anthony it was like I got into I got

820
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,440
into it because it took away gluten and

821
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:26,080
it took away processed foods and then it

822
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:27,600
took away the grain thing where all the

823
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:30,000
grains and all that

824
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:31,720
and I started seeing people improve so I

825
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,480
would make sure they were having an egg

826
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:35,760
you know butter and you know butter in

827
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:38,279
the coffee in the morning eggs you know

828
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:40,679
eggs that whole thing and you know

829
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:42,159
whatever milk you know whole milk and

830
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:44,080
and then they said well then we took out

831
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:47,200
Dairy a year later and saw more

832
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:49,600
improvements so we just put them on pork

833
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:52,600
you know once a day meat for dinner you

834
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:54,399
know um pork in the morning chicken for

835
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:57,159
lunch meat for dinner had a few

836
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:58,919
vegetables in between and because we

837
00:32:57,159 --> 00:33:01,000
took them off of all their their heavy

838
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:02,639
grains and we took them off of all their

839
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,240
sugar and processed foods we were seeing

840
00:33:02,639 --> 00:33:07,559
some improvements but then we got kind

841
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:09,120
of stagnant with it all I said what do

842
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:11,679
you mean by stagnant tell me what are

843
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:13,519
you talking about and and this paleo

844
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:15,000
expert said well you know people just

845
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:16,679
weren't getting people with chronic

846
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,919
illness the kind of people Anthony that

847
00:33:16,679 --> 00:33:19,360
you see every day and you saw all these

848
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:20,720
years they just weren't getting as good

849
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,120
as we wanted them to get so we added

850
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:24,440
more vegetables and we noticed they were

851
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:26,279
starting to improve and then a year

852
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:28,279
later we noticed they're improving more

853
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:30,639
3 years later we started bringing green

854
00:33:28,279 --> 00:33:32,000
juices in so now the Paleo movement's

855
00:33:30,639 --> 00:33:33,480
all with all these green juices so

856
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,760
everybody's Downing these green juices

857
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:37,240
which is amazing a miracle and then he

858
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:39,080
said we brought and then we noticed we

859
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:40,480
can get people better even more with

860
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:43,279
certain green juice with just regular

861
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:45,240
green juices and more vegetables and

862
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:47,679
more vegetables so now we got you know

863
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:49,880
the pale movements divided right now see

864
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:52,000
guys it's actually divided it's crazy

865
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:54,559
it's like how many divides can we have

866
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,799
it's actually unbelievable so now I was

867
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:57,360
talking to this you know this this this

868
00:33:55,799 --> 00:33:59,679
paleo expert and he was telling me now

869
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:01,519
he said well you now it's like now yeah

870
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:03,720
it's divided it's now it's this pale

871
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:05,960
movement where it's just you know some

872
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:07,599
nuts and seeds and some avocado and some

873
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:11,960
some vegetables and then a handful of

874
00:34:07,599 --> 00:34:13,639
berries and and then a piece of meat and

875
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:15,320
then the other side of the py movement's

876
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:16,800
all pissed off at them now you know the

877
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:18,560
people who just haven't caught up to

878
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,040
that and they're like and that's what he

879
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:21,159
was telling me he was telling me they're

880
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,599
they're pissed off cuz they haven't

881
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:24,599
caught up to it I was like well tell me

882
00:34:22,599 --> 00:34:26,960
about it and he saidwell they're still

883
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:28,679
on the whole pork for breakfast thing'

884
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,960
you know pork for breakfast thing so you

885
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:31,520
know you don't do the fruit in the

886
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:33,520
morning you do you don't do the berries

887
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,960
in the morning you do you know the pork

888
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:37,240
for breakfast thing and they're they're

889
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:40,240
totally into that and then you do do you

890
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:42,960
know one salad a day and and then you do

891
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:44,320
the chicken and he said so it's dividing

892
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,599
it's dividing and he and I said why do

893
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,000
you think it that way he says because

894
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:48,320
they're not as experienc they just don't

895
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,200
know that it takes more fruits and

896
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:53,560
vegetables more vegetables um to

897
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:54,919
actually heal someone so I was like you

898
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:56,919
know what everything you're telling me

899
00:34:54,919 --> 00:34:59,280
is is is is is amazing because that's

900
00:34:56,919 --> 00:35:01,640
say oh that's that's how it's happening

901
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,960
he said yeah so now what we're doing is

902
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:04,200
he said Anthony now we're doing to get

903
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,560
the best results out of people we're

904
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:07,400
doing more fruits of vegetables we

905
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:10,359
minimizing animal proteins kind of like

906
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:13,200
what you recommend a lot and I said

907
00:35:10,359 --> 00:35:15,680
that's incredible that's incredible and

908
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:19,000
the reason why it moved to that degree

909
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:20,960
you guys folks it moved to that degree

910
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:24,119
because fruits and vegetables are the

911
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:26,839
holy four they're the holy four that's

912
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:28,359
what it is why do I say holy well well

913
00:35:26,839 --> 00:35:29,680
first of all the the wild blueberry is

914
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:31,680
like the Jesus Christ food it's a

915
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:34,079
resurrection food can literally help you

916
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:36,760
rise out of the ashes literally

917
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:39,040
emotionally physically mentally can help

918
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:41,800
you rise out of the ashes so that's why

919
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:43,000
it's a holy food and you know and and so

920
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:45,240
many of the other foods have these

921
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:47,480
qualities let's talk about some of these

922
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:51,040
Foods this is just so fun

923
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:52,000
today so let's talk about let's talk

924
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:54,599
about some of these Foods let's talk

925
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:57,200
about raw honey raw honey don't be

926
00:35:54,599 --> 00:35:58,680
afraid of raw honey you know know

927
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:02,520
there's this big debate out there it's

928
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:05,000
all sugar it's too it's sugar no it's

929
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:08,880
sugar it's glucose it's sugar it's

930
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:11,680
fructose and glucose it's with

931
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:14,200
200,000 phytochemical

932
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:17,960
compounds gathered and I talked about

933
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:21,560
this one time before gathered by bees

934
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:23,920
from species plant species all over the

935
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:27,520
place wild

936
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:31,400
species wild flowers

937
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:34,359
a wildf flower that we can't even eat

938
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:36,119
meaning an herbal specimen we can't even

939
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:37,920
eat because it's got too many alkaloids

940
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:38,839
or it might it might be too toxic

941
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,319
because there's all these different

942
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:43,000
herbs out there that you can't eat you

943
00:36:41,319 --> 00:36:45,920
know when when you know when I do this

944
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,680
wild foraging with spirit and spirit and

945
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:49,839
I go out into the you know out into the

946
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:51,720
bush and we go looking for things and I

947
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:54,040
say to Spirit what's this I say to

948
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:55,720
Spirit what's this herb what's this bush

949
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:57,319
I say to Spirit what's this tree and

950
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:59,640
spirit tells me what everything thing is

951
00:36:57,319 --> 00:37:01,839
is this edible is this not edible is

952
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:03,319
this mushroom edible is it not edible

953
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:05,079
you know the whole bit if I go through

954
00:37:03,319 --> 00:37:07,800
go go into the woods or go into the bush

955
00:37:05,079 --> 00:37:09,480
or going to you know or going to a field

956
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:12,480
I asked spirit and that the spirit's

957
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:15,760
been training me my whole life and um

958
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:20,640
spirit will say that's a beautiful Wild

959
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:23,160
Flower yes and you can't eat it you

960
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:26,280
can't use that herb that herb is

961
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:31,040
actually toxic but a bee can land on

962
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:34,720
that flower and take miracle miracle

963
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:36,240
medicine out of that flower you guys

964
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:39,880
this is what Spirit would tell me can

965
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:42,640
take a miracle me medicine thousands of

966
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:45,640
compounds that can't even be studied by

967
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:49,079
research and science can't even be

968
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:51,640
studied it would take 500 years for them

969
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:54,720
to know how many chemical compounds are

970
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:56,800
in the in that flower that nectar of

971
00:37:54,720 --> 00:38:01,520
that flower right there that that be he

972
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:04,920
just took back to the nest to make

973
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:05,920
honey okay and then add that to other

974
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:08,599
wild

975
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:11,520
flowers that are edible and non-edible

976
00:38:08,599 --> 00:38:15,079
or usable and non-usable by medicine add

977
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:17,720
that to other ones and the amount of and

978
00:38:15,079 --> 00:38:20,640
what happens is is that phytochemical

979
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:22,920
and that flower in that one species of

980
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:25,720
herb that we can't use the

981
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:28,119
phytochemicals in there we can use them

982
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:30,440
the B takes those

983
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:32,760
phytochemicals homeopathically right

984
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:35,599
from that flower something we can't do

985
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:38,200
in science the bee does the lab work for

986
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:40,480
us takes it back to the nest and

987
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:44,040
transfers it into something usable for

988
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:45,960
us that's a miracle cancer fighting

989
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:49,280
disease fighting chronic illness

990
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:51,760
fighting over 200,000 chemicals

991
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:53,960
phytochemicals that's just the Baseline

992
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:55,920
there are more I'm just talking about

993
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:58,599
the Baseline the reason why I put

994
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:01,160
200,000 chemicals in the life-changing

995
00:38:58,599 --> 00:39:03,079
Foods book is because that's the

996
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:05,240
powerful Foundation of how many

997
00:39:03,079 --> 00:39:07,119
chemicals are in there exactly that's

998
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:09,680
the that's the powerful one it's a

999
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:11,960
little over 200,000 but there's more

1000
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:14,720
that won't even be on science's radar

1001
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:16,359
for a thousand years and seriously here

1002
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:19,079
and that's raw honey so are we going to

1003
00:39:16,359 --> 00:39:21,000
ignore the raw honey I mean it's it it

1004
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:23,240
can it can stop cancer from growing it

1005
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:25,839
can help us in all kinds of levels it it

1006
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:29,000
has enzymes that are not listed anywhere

1007
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:32,160
or just C discovered anywhere enzymes

1008
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:34,440
that help us heal and grow so that's raw

1009
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:36,440
honey all on its own it's it's not only

1010
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:38,640
just loaded with all the minerals

1011
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:41,400
calcium potassium zinc selenium

1012
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:43,200
phosphorus chromium miminum manganese it

1013
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:44,839
can go on and on on it's not even just

1014
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,800
loaded with those it's loaded with co-

1015
00:39:44,839 --> 00:39:49,720
minerals like Co

1016
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:51,880
microminerals that help us to stay alive

1017
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:57,200
that's just honey alone so let's move on

1018
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:59,440
to nettle Leaf nettle Leaf the herb

1019
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:01,240
let's move on to that one you know I

1020
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:02,800
talk about the unforgiving four there's

1021
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:04,720
radiation that's in the air falling out

1022
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,240
of the sky from just Fukushima there's

1023
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:08,319
radiation falling out of the sky from

1024
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:09,920
going back from World War II there's

1025
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:11,880
radiation just in general that we're

1026
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:13,880
exposed to at the dental office we get

1027
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:15,839
an x-ray cuz we bump our butt or we bump

1028
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:18,880
our leg or knee we get an x-r whatever

1029
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:20,800
it is there's radiation it's everywhere

1030
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,280
we flying planes where all the radiation

1031
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,440
is it's up there so let's get it out of

1032
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:28,480
our bodies let's get it out of our

1033
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:30,240
bodies and the net Leaf does that it

1034
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:32,800
helps us it pulls out it's an

1035
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:35,720
anti-radiation wild food you can get

1036
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:37,359
natal leaf tea okay okay so check this

1037
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:39,359
out you guys say you don't have time for

1038
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:41,000
fruits and vegetables say you don't have

1039
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:42,880
time for fruits and vegetables you just

1040
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,319

know what life's like and I know what

1045
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:55,119
it's like to be sick in the world cuz

1046
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:57,280
I've seen it I've seen it my whole life

1047
00:40:55,119 --> 00:41:00,599
since I was a kid watching it it I know

1048
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:02,760
and I could feel it I could feel it and

1049

bacon if all you get you is just you

1056
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:20,599
know a few beans and a piece of chicken

1057
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:22,480
or a piece of turkey and a piece of

1058
00:41:20,599 --> 00:41:24,040
salmon and that's all you can get in you

1059
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:26,880
then fine I stand behind you but let's

1060
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:29,920
do this let's get nettle Leaf Tea in you

1061
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:33,760
let's get nettle Leaf Tea in you nettle

1062
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:37,160
leaf tea just nice big cup of nettle

1063
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:39,400
leaf tea it builds up the bones it

1064
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:41,880
builds up the bones it's bone protecting

1065
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:45,640
it's bone building osteoporosis

1066
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:49,280
osteopenia it's bone fixing it's so high

1067
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:52,359
in silica Nal leaf and over 40 trace

1068
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:54,839
minerals that are bioactive bioavailable

1069
00:41:52,359 --> 00:41:56,920
they go into the bones you won't hear

1070
00:41:54,839 --> 00:41:58,560
this in other places you're only going

1071
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:01,400
to hear it on the show and in this book

1072
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:04,960
life-changing foods but the point is is

1073
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:07,200
that that's what it Harbors it Harbors

1074
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:09,079
that silica those bioavailable

1075
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:13,480
simulatable states of

1076
00:42:09,079 --> 00:42:18,000

food okay this is what I like about this

1088
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:46,599
it

1089
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:49,119
promotes productive bacteria in the

1090
00:42:46,599 --> 00:42:51,920
stomach when you eat sweet potato what

1091
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:55,440
that does is it has phytochemicals that

1092
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:58,240
purposely promote productive bacteria

1093
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:59,800
and the natural sugars in a sweet potato

1094
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:02,200
which are saturated with you know

1095
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:06,880
anti-cancerous properties those natural

1096
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:09,720
sugars they only are designed to

1097
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:13,240
stimulate productive bacteria good

1098
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:17,720
bacteria in the gut bad bacteria

1099
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:21,280
dies when it tries to feed on sweet

1100
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:22,760
potato so sibo people with sibo with all

1101
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:26,240
that strep of cacus I talk about in

1102
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:28,079
their gut strep is what's behind sibo by

1103
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:29,640
the way and no one talks about that

1104
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:31,160
you're only going to hear that here so

1105
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:32,480
anybody who just turned you know like if

1106
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:33,920
this is the first time you turned on the

1107
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:35,440
show I have to say that so you don't

1108
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:37,640
think that that information is just

1109
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:40,680
everywhere because it's not but strepa

1110
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:42,720
cacus anti antibiotic resistant strepa

1111
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:46,920
cacus is responsible for

1112
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:49,359
sibo and that when it tries to feed off

1113
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:52,720
of sweet potato it

1114
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:55,839
dies it dies or it retards or it falls

1115
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:57,440
back okay and and that's what happens

1116
00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:59,480
it's the power of sweet potato that's

1117
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:01,880
why sweet potatoes help with meacon too

1118
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:05,160
they help you know knocking down

1119
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:07,200
SEI they help knock down H pylori sweet

1120
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:10,400
potatoes help kill H

1121
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:12,119
pylori and the thing is H pylori feeds

1122
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:13,319
off of eggs and it feeds off of dairy

1123
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:15,319
products milk cheese and butter if you

1124
00:44:13,319 --> 00:44:18,119
take out milk cheese and butter and you

1125
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:19,440
take out egg and so you someone will say

1126
00:44:18,119 --> 00:44:20,640
to me they'll be like I have eggs once a

1127
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:23,720
month I go well you're feeding your

1128
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:28,160
hpylori once a month and it might be all

1129
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:30,839
the H pylori needs just alive but if you

1130
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:33,280
take out the eggs you take out the dairy

1131
00:44:30,839 --> 00:44:35,760
and then you and then you bring the

1132
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:39,920
sweet potato in you're killing off your

1133
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:42,800
H pylori how about them apples how about

1134
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:44,960
those apples so seriously helps with

1135
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:47,000
crohn's help with colitis the power of

1136
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:49,839

1137
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:52,720
amazing let's shoot to

1138
00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:54,520
radishes radishes they're kind of tough

1139
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:56,520
to eat right cuz you know they're

1140
00:44:54,520 --> 00:45:00,440

sulfur Rich taste and they're kind of

1142
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:04,119
tough to eat in that way but they're

1143
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:07,079
medicine radishes are medicine don't

1144
00:45:04,119 --> 00:45:08,960
ignore them go to the supermarket if

1145
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:10,800
there's one thing to try so say you're

1146
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:12,720
on a budget and you can only get so many

1147
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:14,440
foods for your family you only got so

1148
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:16,359

and you can't get you can only get so

1150
00:45:16,359 --> 00:45:19,440
many things and so there's maybe

1151
00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:21,680
something you can't break into yet

1152
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:23,760
you're like well I can't really start

1153
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:25,359
getting that food it's too much money in

1154
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,880
the budget I got to just worry about

1155
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:28,079
this other stuff try to just grab one

1156
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:32,680
thing grab

1157
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:34,440
radishes just grab radishes cuz radishes

1158
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:36,800
protect us from heart disease protect us

1159
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:39,079
from heart attack protect us from heart

1160
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:40,839
problems viral conditions that cause

1161
00:45:39,079 --> 00:45:43,240
heart disease that are not on the radar

1162
00:45:40,839 --> 00:45:45,559
of of modern medicine or research and

1163
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:47,559
science that Spirit knows about you name

1164
00:45:45,559 --> 00:45:51,160
it cardiovascular

1165
00:45:47,559 --> 00:45:52,920
issues um cholesterol problems bad

1166
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:54,880
cholesterol you want to help start

1167
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:57,920
lowering bad cholesterol you bring

1168
00:45:54,880 --> 00:46:00,240
radishes in and if you bring radishes in

1169
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:03,920
every day that's when the magic starts

1170
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:05,160
to happen you bring them in every day

1171
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:06,839
and you start knocking down bad

1172
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:08,599
cholesterol radishes bring back the

1173
00:46:06,839 --> 00:46:11,480
liver liver problems cause high

1174
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:14,440
cholesterol and elevated blood pressure

1175
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:15,920
radishes help clean that up here's the

1176
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:18,880
best part of radishes I like you know

1177
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:20,760
how there's all this Prebiotic talk you

1178
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:24,040
know what foods are prebiotics and so

1179
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:26,800
forth radishes are the most powerful

1180
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:29,200
Prebiotic there is most powerful

1181
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:30,680
Prebiotic in the gut there is is radish

1182
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:33,400
it's one of the most powerful it's right

1183
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:35,880
on the top of the list actually it's

1184
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:38,520
actually the radishes are the second

1185
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:41,000
most powerful Prebiotic there is next to

1186
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:44,000
Wild blueberry which is the first most

1187
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:46,920
powerful Prebiotic in existence the

1188
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:50,160
Frozen wild blueberry is the most

1189
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:52,119
powerful Prebiotic in existence and then

1190
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:55,079
the radishes are

1191
00:46:52,119 --> 00:46:57,319
second and so and then radish greens

1192
00:46:55,079 --> 00:46:59,960
they got phyto chemicals cancer fighting

1193
00:46:57,319 --> 00:47:02,640
alkaloids that fight cancers so that's

1194
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:04,359
what that's what these greens have get

1195
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:05,960
the ones with the fresh greens cuz you

1196
00:47:04,359 --> 00:47:07,359
want to wash those greens give them a

1197
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:09,280
little rinse and you want to actually

1198
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:12,880
have those in your salad they have

1199
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:15,319
antiviral properties they knock down

1200
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:17,440
viruses and that's a big deal that's a

1201
00:47:15,319 --> 00:47:20,160
really big deal so that's

1202
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:22,599
radishes we got little time left we got

1203
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:25,520
to get through this leafy greens bring

1204
00:47:22,599 --> 00:47:27,680
them in very important leafy greens if

1205
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:29,760
you think you have a hard time digesting

1206
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:31,480
digesting leafy greens you really don't

1207
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:33,119
you're you're digesting them fine you

1208
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:34,680
just feel them that means you have

1209
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:36,480
sensitivities you have you have

1210
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:38,640
sensitive nerves in the gut or the

1211
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:41,880
intestinal tract and you're feeling the

1212
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:44,240
roughage of the leafy green move on down

1213
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:46,599
but you are digesting it I promise you

1214
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:48,240
that so if you don't like the way that

1215
00:47:46,599 --> 00:47:49,880
feels if you have if you're sensitive

1216
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:51,960
like that then eat a little bit of leafy

1217
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:54,119
green some people can eat tons of them

1218
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:56,040
they have less you know less you know

1219
00:47:54,119 --> 00:47:57,760
nerves are less sensitive cuz they're

1220
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:59,440
not chronically feeling you know too

1221
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:02,240
many nerve problems I know people that

1222
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:04,280
have anxiety or sensitive nerves in

1223
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:06,359
their tummy and they're inflamed they

1224
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:08,280
tend to try to eat mush and only kind of

1225
00:48:06,359 --> 00:48:10,640
like cooked mush and like just oatmeal

1226
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:12,800
and stuff because it or eggs and oatmeal

1227
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:16,079
and cheese and all that so they don't

1228
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:17,720
feel it rub their intestinal lining you

1229
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:21,040
know what you what so what happens is

1230
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:22,920
when you eat a green a lettuce it's

1231
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:25,160
rubbing the Linings of the intestinal

1232
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:28,559
tract to clean out eoli and clean out

1233
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:30,079
strep and seff and all and staff and all

1234
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:31,920
bad you know and other things that we

1235
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:33,440
worry about worms and you know and

1236
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:35,920
different parasites people are concerned

1237
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:39,160
about out there you know it pulls all

1238
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:41,520
that out um very important to understand

1239
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:45,880
celery

1240
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:50,680
juice celery juice celery has a

1241
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:53,280
bioactive sodium okay it contains

1242
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:56,480
co-actor microtrace mineral

1243
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:58,760
salts all right yet discovered by

1244
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:02,079
science and research these are different

1245
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:03,920
varieties of sodiums in celery they just

1246
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:05,559
haven't been able to literally in the

1247
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:08,160
lab figure out the different

1248
00:49:05,559 --> 00:49:11,240
compositions that that that are actually

1249
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:13,920
in celery the different sodium salts

1250
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:16,319
this is why it fixes digestive problems

1251
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:19,119
it raises hydrochloric acid fixes the

1252
00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:22,400
liver heals the liver changes people's

1253
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:25,119
guts around completely Crohn's colitis

1254
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:28,160
IBS all kinds of irritable bowel issues

1255
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:30,799

00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:38,839
that exists in the intestinal tract they

1308
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:41,000

1309
00:51:38,839 --> 00:51:42,960
there's an overgrowth a Candida

1310
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,880
someone's concerned about dates lower

else in one of the other shows so if you

1320
00:51:59,079 --> 00:52:02,480

1321
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:05,599
candida chapter in the in the mm book

1322
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:07,799
too the medical medium book the dates

1323
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:10,200
literally help get rid of all these

1324
00:52:07,799 --> 00:52:14,119
poisons too they grab onto poisons

1325
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:16,160
dragging them out of the body high in

1326
00:52:14,119 --> 00:52:18,040
potassium for neurotransmitters as well

1327
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:19,400
dates help restore neurotransmitters so

1328
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:21,559
when people are depressed because of

1329
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:23,960

1331
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:29,640
neurotransmitters are d down and out

1332
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:32,280

1333
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:35,760
trace the 70 trace minerals and

1334
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:38,599

powerful

1340
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:51,119
anti-inflammatory we're talking about in

1341
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:52,359

apples are medicine do not we cannot

1347
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:07,240
deny the power of the Apple it's the

1348
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:08,799

it gathers and expels and putrified

1352
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:19,200
material from old protein stuck on the

1353
00:53:17,359 --> 00:53:21,520
sides of the impacted on the sides of

1354
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:24,520
the intestinal tract apples get rid of

1355
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:25,720
it and apples get rid of sibo knocking

1356
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:27,359
down strep

1357
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:31,839
and they're loaded with manganese and

1358
00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:32,880
mbum you can't avoid apples my friends

1359
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:35,240
they

1360
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:37,359
can't couple of other ones we don't have

1361
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:39,559
time to explain so much but

1362
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:41,319
cilantro don't be afraid of cilantro you

1363
00:53:39,559 --> 00:53:44,640
know that taste when people feel like

1364
00:53:41,319 --> 00:53:46,319
they they they have a genetic resistance

1365
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:48,079
against cilantro they don't have a

1366
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:50,359
genetic problem that's not what it is

1367
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:52,640
that's not why they don't like the taste

1368
00:53:50,359 --> 00:53:53,880
so understand that that's not why it's

1369
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:56,799
just that when you eat cilantro and

1370
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:58,640
you're really toxic it can really taste

1371
00:53:56,799 --> 00:54:00,559
bad if you eat cilantro and and you're

1372
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:02,559
really toxic like if you're really
