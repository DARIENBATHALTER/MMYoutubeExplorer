00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,479
talking about

59
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,600
what people are up against in the air

60
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,200
what they're dealing with different

61
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,560
smells

62
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,280
so it's not like you can you know if

63
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,880
people are near a beach and they go walk

64
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,960
on the beach

65
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,520
it's like you don't even smell the salt

66
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,599
air anymore people go into a park

67
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,360
and they're taking a walk in the park

68
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,760
they don't smell the fresh air anymore

69
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,080
so much people are completely

70
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,879
blitzed out their

71
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,440
senses are blitzed out

72
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:23,120
their cranial nerves are blitzed out

73
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,560
they can't smell

74
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,239
anymore

75
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,920
because they can't they don't know what

76
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,640
they're smelling because they're so

77
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,480
drenched in all kinds of toxic things

78
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,840
right

79
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,000
cold right spring says i can't believe

80
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,800
you you would be back laugh out loud i'm

81
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,160
back

82
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,680
i'm back

83
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,879
so

84
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:45,760
so what happens is that we get so much

85
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:48,840
scent like fragrances in our system

86
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:51,599
we're smelling it all the time they're

87
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:55,280
making sense last longer so there's

88
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:57,120
detergents that are like extra scented

89
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,959
like extra activated so what they're

90
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,599
doing is they're making

91
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:04,480
chemical fragrances

92
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:07,040
where they become activated when you go

93
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,879
near them practically i mean this is

94
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,040
like diabolical

95
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:13,440
chemical concoctions

96
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,599
where if you touch

97
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,360
whatever was on there like if you touch

98
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,120
that fragrance

99
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,840
if it was an air freshener and sprayed

100
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,280
on a couch and you touch that couch it

101
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,920
blows it up

102
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,159
it blows it up that's how highly toxic

103
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,080
toxic it is so chemical companies the

104
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:32,560
chemical industry they sit there and

105
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,319
they design all these dangerous

106
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,480
chemicals

107
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:38,319
and these things are just unchecked and

108
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,640
then they just dump them in products and

109
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:43,360
dump them in products right

110
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:45,680
and that's how it works so perfumes and

111
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,680
clones aren't what they used to be from

112
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,430
yesteryear and this is important to know

113
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,760
too right

114
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:51,599
[Music]

115
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,400
if you're somebody with chronic illness

116
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:56,080
okay you don't want you don't want to be

117
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,319
using perfumes and clones let's just

118
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,560
break that one so we just it's just a

119
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,680
continuation of the amazon live i just

120
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,200

so

126
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,640
what happens is people don't realize

127
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,199
that perfumes and colognes aren't like

128
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,280
they were a hundred years ago 80 years

129
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,280
ago 60 years ago

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,520
they're a lot worse now they're really

131
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,720
dangerous chemical concoctions is what

132
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,240
they are

133
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,400
and people don't realize this and if

134
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,000
anybody's got chronic illness and

135
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,840
they're breathing this in every day

there's people on

137
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,000

so

149
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,680

practically

154
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,639
so people don't realize

155
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,240
that when they get

156
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,000

and what they don't realize is is that's

160
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,280
lowering their immune system and

161
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,360
intoxicating them in a really

162
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,360
effective way where it affects their

210
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,400
fragrances

211
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,720
send the candles and all that stuff so

212
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,599
send a candle santa candles is another

213
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,479
one

214
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:16,080
to be really concerned about

215
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,840
is the scented candles they come in all

216
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,199
shapes and sizes

217
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,639
and

218
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,000
that's something that's really

219
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,520
interesting too so people think they're

220
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,759
health experts of course and they're

221
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,080
like well and you may be a health expert

222
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,520
absolutely but what happens is there's a

223
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,440
lot of people though they're like you

224
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:34,240
know lighting their scented candles but

225
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:36,160
they're also into natural health

226
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,919
and they're literally intoxicating the

227
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,120
people around them they're poisoning

228
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:41,120
their family they're poisoning

229
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,639
themselves with the said the candles

230
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,479
because we're talking about a

231
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:47,520
compilation of a

232
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:50,319
thousand chemicals and more

233
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:52,960
yeah incense is bad too totally crucial

234
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,639
on youtube incense is really bad as well

235
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,960
we're talking about a lot

236
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,479
of chemical concoctions

237
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,479
that are

238
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:02,639
irritating and damaging to the central

239
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,240
nervous system chemicals are a big one

240
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,160
right now so we're heading to a place

241
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,000
where no one

242
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,080
10 years from now

243
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,800
is going to be able to really smell what

244
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,759
nature smells like anymore those days

245
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,759
are over

246
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,800
because people are going to be coated in

247
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:19,120
all this stuff they're going to be

248
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:22,240
coated in fabric softeners detergents

249
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,840
that have scents and fragrances right

250
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,639
they're going to be coated in all of

251
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,800
this

252
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,800
okay so michael h says poisons are

253
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,720
everywhere and we must live in constant

254
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,959
fear aw

255
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,560
we don't we we don't that's not it at

256
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:36,560
all what it is it's about chronic

257
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,479
illness so if you're somebody with no

258
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,479
chronic illness

259
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,560
okay and you're not struggling with any

260
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,240
kind of symptoms and conditions

261
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:47,760
and you want to douse yourself in

262
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:49,440
chemicals until someday those chemicals

263
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,360
take you out

264
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,360
be that person

265
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,200
so if you're not sick with anything and

266
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,720
you want to use all the fabric softeners

267
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,720
and you want to use the detergents with

268
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,399
the fragrances you want to dump perfumes

269
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,880
and clones on you and you want to burn

270
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:05,600
scented candles and you want to stick

271
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:08,560
plug-ins in the wall and you want to

272
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:10,320
cook yourself with all this stuff right

273
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,560
if you want to do that and live your

274
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,920
life fine eventually it'll get you in

275
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,839
the end and you'll be like walking

276
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,560
around dementia and be like this later

277
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,560
on you'll be like

278
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,040
you'll just be that person that walked

279
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:25,440
out of their house

280
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:28,880
in their underwear

281
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,560
and you're walking down the street

282
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,240
and all of a sudden a family member has

283
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,240
to call the police

284
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,000
and they have to say my aunt just walked

285
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,959
out of the house she's got dementia we

286
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,959
don't know where she went

287
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,519
and that's what happens you know so that

288
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,040
will happen later on fine you might be

289
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,240
that person you get nothing going on but

290
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,760
when it comes down to chronic illness

291
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,320
when it comes down to neurological

292
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:53,120
symptoms when it comes down to aches and

293
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,480
pains ticks and spasms chronic fatigue

294
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,040
burning skin

295
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:59,279
jaw pain neck pain back pain eczema

296
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,720
psoriasis you want to know

297
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:02,640
about these chemicals and these

298
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,440
fragrances you want to know about them

299
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,279
all

300
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:08,640
that's really important because it's

301
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:10,959
it's not about being in fear

302
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:13,279
it's about protecting yourself so does

303
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,560
it make sense to you where

304
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:17,519
okay because

305
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,480
i know somebody right

306
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,000
that

307
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,000
they use cologne

308
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,920
lots of it right

309
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,800
lots of it okay

310
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,800
their child

311
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:30,320
and their pets

312
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:33,040
have all these problems

313
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,800
and the clone is just like saturating

314
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,880
the house because every time you use it

315
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,480
every day it gets on everything it rubs

316
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,160
on the walls it gets on the furniture it

317
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,360
gets in everything right

318
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,480
right

319
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,440
and so

320
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,360
the the children were getting sick baby

321
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,680
was getting sick

322
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,720
pets were getting sick

323
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,839
right

324
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,640
and

325
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:56,880
this person got rid of the clone

326
00:10:54,640 --> 00:11:00,560
and everybody started getting better

327
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:02,160
it's that toxic that toxic and it all

328
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,160
depends on what's happening in your life

329
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:07,600
you can be that person it doesn't affect

330
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:09,440
but eventually it will right so

331
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,760
when it comes down to all of these

332
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:14,240
chemicals it's not like it used to be

333
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,800
these chemicals are a lot more dangerous

334
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,720
because they go deep into your cells

335
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,720
they go deep into your organs and

336
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:24,480
there's a difference here

337
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:28,040
it's not like it was years ago okay

338
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,040
we're in a time

339
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:33,440
cornelius says i lost smell since

340
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,360
december don't don't smell a thing but

341
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,480
get headaches around cleaning products

342
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,040
or perfumes

343
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,600
or perfumes because the reason why is

344
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:44,079
even though you can't smell the perfume

345
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,880
right perfume perfumes you can't smell

346
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,240
them

347
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,920
they're causing

348
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,600
a problem with your central nervous

349
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:52,240
system so they cause a problem with your

350
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,079
health it's a prime example but when you

351
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,519
can smell them too you'll even correlate

352
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:57,839
it that way too

353
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,839
okay

354
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
yeah

355
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,079
so

356
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,760
christy i was struggling with chemical

357
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:06,560
sensitivities before knowing from

358
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:08,160
anthony its origins thank god i know now

359
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,839
how to protect myself with this

360
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:12,320
information kristy why don't you just

361
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:14,079
plug in air fresheners

362
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,880
light some scented candles start get

363
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:19,360
some new perfumes right no you no way

364
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:21,120
cause exactly you're so smart

365
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,800
because it's important once you know you

366
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,040
can protect yourself and not have all

367
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,120
that exactly so here's what happens with

368
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,880
the chemicals today and i want to just

369
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,959
i just want to run this by you guys this

370
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:34,000
is serious stuff

371
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:36,720
what's in scented candles and

372
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,639
ever since the whole plague started

373
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:42,880
the scent scenic candle world has

374
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:44,800
exploded every single person practically

375
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,959
in the united states

376
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,839
and other places around the world almost

377
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:52,399
every single person decided to buy a

378
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:54,560
candle or start burning the candles they

379
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:57,519
had and buy more candles

380
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:59,440
and so every home and apartment around

381
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:01,519
the world basically especially in the

382
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,279
u.s they're scented candles now burning

383
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,560
so ever since everybody was kind of like

384
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,800
locked down

385
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,639
in that plague situation

386
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,320
they were just burning scented candles

387
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,600
it was like rituals everybody had them

388
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,440
on their coffee tables they had them in

389
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,399
their bedrooms it just it's the candles

390
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,800
right

391
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,800
they got highly highly intoxicated we've

392
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,959
come to a point where

393
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,560
it's really out of control so what what

394
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:24,480
is in here what's a chemical what's a

395
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:27,680
dangerous chemical it's a synthesized

396
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:30,079
it's synthesized material that was

397
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,600
synthesized off of another material off

398
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:33,040
of another material off another material

399
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,240
chemicals aren't just they create a

400
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:37,120
chemical and that's the chemical they

401
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,720
use and that's it they create a chemical

402
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,839
then they mix it with another chemical

403
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,360
create a new chemical mix it with

404
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:43,600
another chemical create a pneumochemical

405
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,760
and what they do is they create

406
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,199
like a bloodline

407
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,279
of chemicals

408
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:50,880
that are destructive in nature more

409
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,240
stronger than the last chemical and

410
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,920
stronger than the last chemical and then

411
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,360
stronger than the last chemical and

412
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,040
that's one of the reasons why it's so

413
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,639
devastating on the system and everything

414
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,240

00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,880
get your hair done you don't have to get

429
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,839
the chemical say look can i not get all

430
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,000
the

431
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:32,480
all the chemicals can you not spray all

432
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,399

433
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,639
that's a nice hairstyle we just gave you

434
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:39,120
let me just

435
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:41,199
spray all this chemical on you right

436
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,800
it's like when it comes out as chemicals

437
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:45,760
they're not much different than this

438
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:47,680
right here it's like basically

439
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:50,079
look i'm just gonna spray this insects

440
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,440
killer on your on your head okay so let

441
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:53,440
me just spray this on your head

442
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,600
afterwards

443
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,560
there isn't much different a difference

444
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,560
at all

445
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,560
from pesticides herbicides fungicides

446
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:03,440
because pesticides are in hair care

447
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:06,160
products they're in perfumes i'm not

448
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,600
talking about a trace of pesticide i'm

449
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,519
talking about

450
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,680
pesticide

451
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:13,600
like a certain level of it a certain

452
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,040
amount of it used as an ingredient

453
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,880
purposely that's the difference like

454
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,560
they're like okay we're going to make

455
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,920
this perfume

456
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,360
and we're going to add the ingredients

457
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,959
into this perfume since nobody knows

458
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,720
what they are and we're going to add

459
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:26,160
actual pesticide and they actually put

460
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,760
real pesticides and that's the whole

461
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,639
point that's why pesticides smell like

462
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:35,199
perfume people don't realize it

463
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:36,959
pesticides insecticides lawn chemicals

464
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:38,800
okay if you've ever

465
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,320
if you ever live near a conventional

466
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,160
farm

467
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,680
where they're spraying everything

468
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,519
they're spraying tomatoes they're

469
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,360
spraying you know whatever it is

470
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,959
zucchini they're spraying whatever it is

471
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,120
if you ever been next to a conventional

472
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:53,279
farmer they're spraying cabbage

473
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:56,560
it's perfume

474
00:15:53,279 --> 00:16:00,720
the insecticides are using on all of the

475
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:02,480
crops are straight perfume you literally

476
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,639
you litter there's no difference between

477
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,639
the person walking by in the street with

478
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:09,440
the perfume the wind blowing the perfume

479
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:11,040
off of them and what's in the field

480
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,519
they're one and the same people don't

481
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:15,600
realize that that's how crazy it is yes

482
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:17,360
there's differences but they're actually

483
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,120
still connected

484
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:22,000

you guys this is incredible so we're

500
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:59,360
here we're talking about the damaging

501
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:02,720
effects of these chemicals so we're

502
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:04,319
breathing in more toxins than we know

503
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,079
and they're around us every day so the

504
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:08,000
regular ones are like your fabrics

505
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:10,480
offenders your detergents right your

506
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,240
household cleaners right your insect

507
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,839
killers right that's the whole thing

508
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,000
your insect killers

509
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:17,039
right you want to like kill your insects

510
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,039
right

511
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:20,400
and everything's got a roach right here

512
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:22,400
everybody's trying to kill everything

513
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,400
that crawls into their house

514
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,760
and they're breathing all that up

515
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,079
breathing it in it's getting in their

516
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:30,160
organs so where does all the stuff go

517
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:32,720
it goes inside the liver

518
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,640
that's one place it goes it goes inside

519
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,480
every single organ it goes inside the

520
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,559
lungs it stays in the lungs forever it

521
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:41,919
goes inside the heart stays in the heart

522
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,919
stays in the nervous system

523
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:48,240
i mean it's just it it travels all

524
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:50,320
through the body

525
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,840
and it stays in the body stays in the

526
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,600
brain that's the other place it goes

527
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,280
that's a big deal right there so any

528
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:58,559
chemicals we're breathing in

529
00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:00,640
stays in the brain forever

530
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:02,799
it just does

531
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,640
stays in the brain forever unless we get

532
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:07,600
it out and it's hard to get it out

533
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:10,799
unless you do the right things

534
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:12,880

you know

612
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:03,440
it's a b12 right here when it comes down

613
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,520
to the central nervous system it's

614
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,520
critical

615
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:09,280
critical to have the b12 you need now

616
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,919
b12 testing

617
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:15,200
doesn't cut the mustard it doesn't

618
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:17,520
because they can't tell in a b12 test if

619
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,440
the b12 is entered the nervous system so

620
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,200
i always keep people that i've ever

621
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,679
known like friends and family i keep

622
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:26,240
them on a lot of b12

623
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:28,480
and i keep staying like i personally

624
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,320
take a lot of b12 every single day

625
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,000
that's what i do this is the vimergy b12

626
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,799
it's v is in victor

627
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,200
i

628
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:37,760
am is in mary ergy dot com so

629
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,360
vimergy.com

630
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,520
i'm not sponsored this is the

631
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:43,200
methylcobalamin in adenosil cobalamin

632
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:46,080
b12

633
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,039
this is the b12 to use

634
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,440
okay

635
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:51,919
i don't own the b12 company and i'm not

and i give friends and family right

638
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:58,640
so it's one of the defenses

639
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,440
use

640
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,960
against like the chemical world because

641
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,799
if you're gonna be

642
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,320

and professional life right

708
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:28,720
where i'm working 20 hours a day at the

709
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,400
same time getting kicked in the stomach

710
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:33,200
i walk around with a kick me sign on my

711
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:34,799
back just so you know i do

712
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,400
it comes with the territory of hearing a

713
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:37,600
voice that's age four so walk around

714
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,279
with the kick me sign in the back it's

715
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:41,440
just what happens you know so when

716
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:43,440
things are happening in life

717
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,120
b12 is critical for protecting yourself

718
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,559
critical for protecting your nervous

719
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,679
system because it's about the nervous

720
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:49,919
system

721
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:51,520
that's a big deal and so whenever so

722
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:55,120
we're talking about like chemical

723
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:56,880
fragrances perfumes perfumes fragrance

724
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:59,039
means

725
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:01,840
you're not allowed to know what's in

726
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:03,919
there the reason why

727
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:06,400
you're not allowed to know what's in

728
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:08,159
that fragrance

729
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,679
whether it's an air freshener a plug-in

730
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:11,200
one whether it's a spray one whether

731
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:12,640
it's a spray bottle one whether it's out

732
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,279
of a can the reason why you're not so

733
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:17,440
allowed to know what's in in that

734
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:20,960
fragrance

735
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:22,320
is because it's highly toxic

736
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:25,440
if

737
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,840
someone was to fill

738
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:30,559
a giant

739
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:32,559
container of that fragrance in there

740
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:34,640
and you were to dive in there

741
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:36,799
and take a bath in it

742
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:39,279
you would die

743
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:40,840
but when it's in small amounts

744
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:44,320
you don't die

745
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:45,840
fast spray it on you

746
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:48,480
breathe it in

747
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,600
you don't die quick right you breathe it

748
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,840
in

749
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:54,400
get the laundry going oh i got the

750
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:56,320
laundry with the extra fragrance scent

751
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,200
in there let me get my laundry out of

752
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,919
there

753
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,880
you know fabric softeners you don't die

754
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:04,240
quick

755
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:05,760
right it's a slow death really slow

756
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:08,000
death right

757
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:09,600
now if they took all those chemicals

758
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,039
from your fabric softener from your

759
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,360
detergents

760
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:15,919
from your perfumes from all this stuff

761
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:19,120
and they put they put it into a big

762
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:21,039
swimming pool and they pushed you in it

763
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:23,679
and you decided to take a bath for an

764
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:25,039
hour in it you would die

765
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:26,559
you would die

766
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:28,880
that would be it you would die in the

767
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:31,120
hole you would die in that in that in

768
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:33,279
that chemical bath

769
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,880
so but what they do is just put a little

770
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:37,440
in all these things

771
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:39,039
and they they kill you that way

772
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,480
right

773
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:43,039
death by a thousand cuts that's right

m e r g dot com it's vmrg.com i'm not

802
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:42,399
sponsored

803
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:44,240
not the owner of the company

804
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:46,000
um okay

805
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,520
so we're we're talking about chemical

806
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,360
chemical products chemical sense and

807
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:52,720
then there's stuff that is it's out of

808
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:53,840
our control they drop it out of the sky

809
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,200
so there's all the chemicals are

810
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:58,240
dropping out of the sky in us all the

811
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:00,159
time mosquito spray right so that's just

812
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:02,399
happening all the time they're just

813
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:04,480
dropping mosquito spray out there they

814
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:07,200
put billions and trillions and trillions

815
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,720
of genetically modified mosquitoes out

816
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,399
there

817
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,159
and then they drop mosquito spray which

818
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:14,240
doesn't kill them

819
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:16,080
because they're still there

820
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:18,240
they can helicopter all that mosquito

821
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:20,240
spray over us all the time in every

822
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:23,360
state in the united states all around

823
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,559
the globe they drop it on everybody

824
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,760
every year

825
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:27,919
every month

826
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,880
every other week in your town in your

827
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:30,399
village

828
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,520
whether anybody likes it or not they

829
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:32,720
drop it

830
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,840
so they're doing is they're like just

831
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,760
doing that

832
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:37,600
because they're trying to exterminate

833
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:40,159
mosquitoes

834
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:42,480
but they never get rid of them

835
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:44,880
exactly and then we're breathing that in

836
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:47,600
all the time okay

837
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:49,600
so yeah when it comes down to b12 levels

838
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:52,399
it works like this even if your b12

839
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:55,279
levels show up good

840
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:58,320
it doesn't mean they're testing your b12

841
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:59,760
levels in your central nervous system

842
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:02,559
they can't

843
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:03,440
check how much b12 is in your vagus

844
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:04,799
nerves

845
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,919
so let's talk about that for a little

846
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:08,240
bit

847
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:08,240
okay

848
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:13,840
so your brain stem back here okay

849
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:16,159
this is important to know your brain

850
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:18,480
stem

851
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:18,480
all right

852
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:23,919
okay your brain stem that comes down

853
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:25,360
right comes down through here

854
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:28,240
your vagus nerves that come off your

855
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:30,559
brain stem they can't do a b12 test on

856
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,720
your vagus nerves they can't check your

857
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:35,679
brain stem to see how much b12 is in

858
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,640
your brain stem they can't check

859
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:38,080
your

860
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,880
brain

861
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:42,960
to see how much b12 is in your brain

862
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,240
right but if you're still chronically

863
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,080
sick

864
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:51,039
and you've got anxiety

865
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:53,760
depression bipolar ocd depersonalization

866
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:55,200
right schizophrenia

867
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,720
body pain

868
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,840
burning skin

869
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:01,760
tingles numbness twitches

870
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:03,279
by the way we're on twitch you guys now

871
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,880
spasms

872
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:05,840
okay

873
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,880
right

874
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,799
and

875
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,000
ticks

876
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:11,440
right

877
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,200
dizziness

878
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:16,399
vertigo

879
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:19,200
ringing in the ears tinnitus if you got

880
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:22,080
all of that or any of it

881
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:25,279
your central nervous system

882
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:26,799
needs that b12 so they'll say your b12

883
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:28,880
levels are fine

884
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:30,559
but if you got all these conditions or

885
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:33,039
symptoms

886
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:34,159
your b12 levels aren't fine it's

887
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:36,559
critical

888
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:39,840
to actually

889
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:41,760
to actually fix things it really is

890
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,200
all right so

891
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,880
you guys we're just covering some

892
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,960
different stuff on chemicals chemical

893
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,720
toxins all the stuff we breathe in

894
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,799
everywhere this doesn't even include

895
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,159
like exhaust and other stuff like that

896
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:53,520
this doesn't include all the different

897
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:55,039
things that we're up against all the

898
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,960
time

899
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:59,760
but we're also up against things that we

900
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:01,679
can control like perfumes like care care

901
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:04,000
products like body lotions with all this

902
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:05,760
stuff in it right hand creams that have

903
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,519
all this chemical in it we can't see

904
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:09,600
fragrant stuff fragrance laundry

905
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:11,519
detergent all those different things and

906
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,799
that breaks us down and beats us down

907
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:15,200
