[152.72 - 156.40] one talks about it really
[154.64 - 157.76] unless they heard it from medical medium

[1709.52 - 1717.60] there we go nice
[1713.84 - 1717.60] i get a nice potato bowl right here
[1719.12 - 1722.88] and i'm gonna make a salsa too so i got
[1721.60 - 1724.88] the potato bowl
[1722.88 - 1726.72] so this is a deep bowl so it's got a
[1724.88 - 1727.68] different different vibe to it right
[1726.72 - 1729.52] different look
[1727.68 - 1731.60] here it is you got the onions you got
[1729.52 - 1733.20] the mushrooms you guys see this on tik
[1731.60 - 1734.96] tok you see this on youtube facebook
[1733.20 - 1736.00] mushrooms onions you got the red bell
[1734.96 - 1739.76] peppers
[1736.00 - 1741.28] right you got the and then you have the
[1739.76 - 1743.12] potatoes that are nice and brown they
[1741.28 - 1743.52] were pre-steamed and then i threw them
[1743.12 - 1746.00] in the
[1743.52 - 1747.60] in the on the griddle there and started
[1746.00 - 1749.12] moving them around getting them nice and
[1747.60 - 1751.92] toasty right
[1749.12 - 1753.76] okay no oil in this so no insulin
[1751.92 - 1756.00] resistance
[1753.76 - 1757.04] really important to know no insulin
[1756.00 - 1759.04] resistance
[1757.04 - 1760.88] think about that a little bit because
[1759.04 - 1762.96] everybody they're living by insulin
[1760.88 - 1764.40] resistance and they're living by chasing
[1762.96 - 1764.96] a high which i'll talk about again a
[1764.40 - 1767.04] little bit
[1764.96 - 1768.40] that's what they live by and the oil
[1767.04 - 1770.96] causes your adrenal
[1768.40 - 1773.68] your adrenaline to surge and flood the
[1770.96 - 1775.60] oil causes adrenaline to surge and flood
[1773.68 - 1776.72] so you get addicted to fat that's how
[1775.60 - 1779.04] it's done right
[1776.72 - 1780.16] and then now you're on this roller
[1779.04 - 1781.44] coaster ride
[1780.16 - 1783.44] it's to thin out your blood your
[1781.44 - 1786.80] adrenals release all this adrenaline to
[1783.44 - 1788.40] thin out your blood right that's how
[1786.80 - 1790.56] it's done
[1788.40 - 1792.00] yeah smoky mountain paradise i think i
[1790.56 - 1795.20] see you guys
[1792.00 - 1796.32] and yeah so anyway that's but we still
[1795.20 - 1799.12] got more to go
[1796.32 - 1799.12] and more to do
[1802.08 - 1807.12] yeah you guys the industries sit there
[1805.20 - 1808.40] and they mastermind a way to keep you
[1807.12 - 1810.40] guys tricked fold
[1808.40 - 1812.64] and duped the wool being pulled over
[1810.40 - 1814.56] your eyes it's constant all the time
[1812.64 - 1816.32] and it's it's happening in alternative
[1814.56 - 1817.20] medicine it's just not just conventional
[1816.32 - 1819.92] medicine
[1817.20 - 1821.52] and it's supposed to be the new normal
[1819.92 - 1823.12] and you're never supposed to doubt it or
[1821.52 - 1824.64] question it and you're never supposed to
[1823.12 - 1826.56] think science of research
[1824.64 - 1829.28] is missing a beat you're never supposed
[1826.56 - 1831.52] to think that they failed
[1829.28 - 1832.88] the heck out of everything that they
[1831.52 - 1836.08] failed us
[1832.88 - 1839.04] that their failures absolute
[1836.08 - 1840.32] failures failures failures and chronic
[1839.04 - 1842.64] illness right
[1840.32 - 1844.40] when someone's literally laying in their
[1842.64 - 1845.60] bed they've seen 10 neurologists and
[1844.40 - 1847.36] they can't function
[1845.60 - 1849.36] and nobody knows really what's wrong and
[1847.36 - 1852.56] they have 10 theoretical
[1849.36 - 1856.64] diagnoses they failed them
[1852.56 - 1858.88] that's what that is it's not the doctor
[1856.64 - 1861.28] that failed them it's science of
[1858.88 - 1863.36] research that failed the doctors and
[1861.28 - 1864.96] failed the patients right and i believe
[1863.36 - 1867.68] in science and research i do
[1864.96 - 1868.80] it's not that i don't it's not that i
[1867.68 - 1871.92] don't
[1868.80 - 1872.48] okay but in chronic illness they have
[1871.92 - 1875.20] failed
[1872.48 - 1876.88] miserably denial is a place where
[1875.20 - 1878.56] science and research lives
[1876.88 - 1881.12] then here's how it works at science
[1878.56 - 1884.88] research the industry itself
[1881.12 - 1888.56] spends billions to make sure they police
[1884.88 - 1889.28] you your police so that everywhere you
[1888.56 - 1892.48] go
[1889.28 - 1894.48] you believe they have they have your
[1892.48 - 1896.48] back and they have all the answers and
[1894.48 - 1898.08] everything's perfect in science and
[1896.48 - 1901.28] research world
[1898.08 - 1903.52] that's how it's that's how it's staged
[1901.28 - 1905.76] and the minute you get sick the blame is
[1903.52 - 1906.00] on you it's your fault clubhouse it's
[1905.76 - 1907.92] all
[1906.00 - 1910.64] your fault you guys are sick on
[1907.92 - 1913.68] clubhouse it's your fault

[1916.56 - 1919.36] your fault totally your fault
[1918.24 - 1921.60] science research they have all the
[1919.36 - 1924.40] answers apparently they know everything
[1921.60 - 1924.80] so you being sick it's your fault tick
[1924.40 - 1928.08] tock

[1961.36 - 1964.16] you guys i'm gonna get my science
[1962.64 - 1966.40] research blanket because
[1964.16 - 1967.68] they're gonna take care of me hold on i
[1966.40 - 1969.52] gotta get my science and research
[1967.68 - 1972.88] blanket really quick okay
[1969.52 - 1974.56] yeah okay you guys i need to get my
[1972.88 - 1977.20] science and research blanket
[1974.56 - 1978.56] oh my god my science and research
[1977.20 - 1981.68] blanket right here
[1978.56 - 1984.72] oh science and research oh my god

[2007.60 - 2011.12] i need another science research blanket
[2010.08 - 2013.20] i better hurry up
[2011.12 - 2016.08] because alternative science is so smart

[2016.08 - 2020.64] let me get my alternative my alternative
[2018.64 - 2021.84] science and research blank as fast as
[2020.64 - 2024.88] possible
[2021.84 - 2025.92] oh thank god thank god i have my
[2024.88 - 2028.48] alternative
[2025.92 - 2029.04] research and science blanket right here
[2028.48 - 2031.92] because
[2029.04 - 2033.84] recent alternative medicine research in
[2031.92 - 2037.12] science has my back too
[2033.84 - 2040.40] yeah so comfortable nice what i gotta
[2037.12 - 2042.16] huh yeah wait i forgot
[2040.40 - 2043.60] the doctor's office is calling me that

[2054.24 - 2057.68] research blankets my alternative and
[2056.00 - 2058.64] conventional medicine science research
[2057.68 - 2061.92] blanket
[2058.64 - 2065.60] uh-huh they know everything uh-huh

[2084.72 - 2087.52] life should i be mad at science and
[2087.04 - 2090.56] research
[2087.52 - 2091.84] no no never be mad at science and
[2090.56 - 2095.52] research
[2091.84 - 2097.68] no they're my comforting warm blanket
[2095.52 - 2099.36] because i can sleep at night knowing
[2097.68 - 2102.56] that science and research has
[2099.36 - 2105.52] my back i could just go to bed at night
[2102.56 - 2107.04] science and research they got me covered
[2105.52 - 2110.80] i could sleep at night

[2119.36 - 2123.92] oh you don't have an answer for my child
[2121.76 - 2125.04] okay but science and research is so
[2123.92 - 2128.32] comforting
[2125.04 - 2130.64] they have every answer that's ever been
[2128.32 - 2132.80] that's why on tick tock when all the
[2130.64 - 2135.52] science research trolls
[2132.80 - 2137.04] report you because they say that science
[2135.52 - 2140.88] is everything
[2137.04 - 2144.00] yeah it's so comforting same thing on
[2140.88 - 2146.00] on facebook too yeah did you hear about
[2144.00 - 2147.36] that medical medium put a post about
[2146.00 - 2150.16] banana
[2147.36 - 2152.80] and facebook banned it and said that it
[2150.16 - 2155.68] didn't have science in it
[2152.80 - 2158.00] yeah that's why we love science so much
[2155.68 - 2160.56] it's so nice
[2158.00 - 2162.24] is this no we're supposed to be sick my
[2160.56 - 2163.84] children are supposed to be sick that's
[2162.24 - 2166.72] the new normal
[2163.84 - 2168.08] but isn't science and research so cuddly
[2166.72 - 2172.24] and comfy
[2168.08 - 2178.00] okay i gotta go okay
[2172.24 - 2181.52] oh you guys i got to make some salsa
[2178.00 - 2184.00] um let's go let's go we got to get back
[2181.52 - 2187.76] we got to get back to work
[2184.00 - 2191.04] we got to get back to work you guys
[2187.76 - 2192.56] yeah um basically i'll give you another
[2191.04 - 2194.40] what you want a nutshell you guys on
[2192.56 - 2198.00] clubhouse you want a nutshell
[2194.40 - 2200.72] i and i don't mean a nut in a nutshell
[2198.00 - 2202.88] but you guys want a nutshell okay the
[2200.72 - 2206.08] system's rigged
[2202.88 - 2209.36] so that you guys are brainwashed by
[2206.08 - 2212.48] the science and research cult
[2209.36 - 2213.68] not only that there's a lot of cults out
[2212.48 - 2215.36] there
[2213.68 - 2216.64] it's not about freedom like here in the
[2215.36 - 2217.92] medical mean community because you're
[2216.64 - 2219.60] free to be
[2217.92 - 2221.84] you're free to do whatever you want
[2219.60 - 2225.12] right but
[2221.84 - 2228.64] in the colts out there it's rigged
[2225.12 - 2230.72] and they all do the same thing
[2228.64 - 2232.32] they all parrot the same thing they all
[2230.72 - 2233.68] mirror the same thing
[2232.32 - 2235.36] they're all the smoke and mirrors right
[2233.68 - 2238.00] right michelle miller right
[2235.36 - 2239.68] and right chris you seem fine to me and
[2238.00 - 2242.80] that's how it's done out there
[2239.68 - 2245.36] okay and then they blanket it under the
[2242.80 - 2248.16] nice science research blanket
[2245.36 - 2248.72] that's how it's done and then every
[2248.16 - 2252.48] single
[2248.72 - 2255.60] person gets sicker and sicker and sicker
[2252.48 - 2258.40] and sicker that's how it's done
[2255.60 - 2259.44] and it's the new norm educating myself
[2258.40 - 2264.32] good to see you today
[2259.44 - 2264.32] that's the new norm all right yeah
[2267.60 - 2270.72] tight werner says that's true exactly
[2269.20 - 2274.00] exactly
[2270.72 - 2277.04] and that's how it's done out there okay
[2274.00 - 2278.72] um kathy says have an open mind yeah
[2277.04 - 2280.96] have an open mind
[2278.72 - 2283.04] it's a good one right there have an open
[2280.96 - 2284.24] mind to what's happening out there
[2283.04 - 2286.08] and you gotta understand something
[2284.24 - 2287.52] here's how the colts work out there
[2286.08 - 2289.04] they have think tanks like i was telling
[2287.52 - 2289.44] you guys in clubhouse a little bit while
[2289.04 - 2292.24] ago
[2289.44 - 2293.04] right they got think tanks designed to
[2292.24 - 2297.44] make sure
[2293.04 - 2300.24] you never ever ever stop your addictions
[2297.44 - 2302.40] you stay addicted you won't know you're
[2300.24 - 2304.40] addicted until you get rid of it
[2302.40 - 2305.76] you won't know you're addicted until you
[2304.40 - 2308.80] get rid of it
[2305.76 - 2310.72] okay you won't know you won't know that
[2308.80 - 2312.56] every single bug in your body
[2310.72 - 2314.96] wants to eat those eggs that you're
[2312.56 - 2315.60] eating you won't know the egg addiction
[2314.96 - 2318.80] until you
[2315.60 - 2321.44] rid it until you rid the eggs
[2318.80 - 2322.64] that feed every bug in your body that's
[2321.44 - 2325.44] right
[2322.64 - 2326.00] you won't know the addiction until you
[2325.44 - 2329.20] knock out
[2326.00 - 2332.48] that chocolate bar right
[2329.20 - 2335.60] until you break that chocolate addiction
[2332.48 - 2338.72] because the caffeine industry has
[2335.60 - 2340.08] you brainwashed they need you addicted
[2338.72 - 2343.52] for the rest of your
[2340.08 - 2345.92] life until you're in your grave
[2343.52 - 2346.96] until you're in there they the caffeine
[2345.92 - 2349.36] industry
[2346.96 - 2351.12] i wouldn't doubt it if they don't come
[2349.36 - 2353.36] up with a drink
[2351.12 - 2354.88] you give someone after they passed away
[2353.36 - 2358.16] that's caffeine-based
[2354.88 - 2360.08] like no no no just just pour it in their
[2358.16 - 2362.08] mouth
[2360.08 - 2363.28] pour it in their mouth it's a little
[2362.08 - 2365.84] caffeine pill
[2363.28 - 2366.96] for people who passed away make sure you
[2365.84 - 2369.28] purchase it
[2366.96 - 2370.48] make sure you purchase it it's got cacao
[2369.28 - 2372.40] in it
[2370.48 - 2373.76] it's got cacao science research says
[2372.40 - 2376.16] cacao so good for you
[2373.76 - 2377.36] make sure you put a little cacao pill in
[2376.16 - 2380.00] the person's mouth
[2377.36 - 2381.52] after they passed away i mean they are
[2380.00 - 2385.04] literally trying to
[2381.52 - 2386.32] to in every way possible

[2433.20 - 2441.36] look into mm for their autoimmune yeah
[2438.16 - 2443.20] so so the whole goal is
[2441.36 - 2444.48] and i'm just going into caffeine for a
[2443.20 - 2446.80] second i'm not talking about all the
[2444.48 - 2448.32] industries on a whole right including
[2446.80 - 2450.00] much of the alternative medicine
[2448.32 - 2452.48] industry it's about making sure you guys
[2450.00 - 2455.36] stay brainwashed your whole life
[2452.48 - 2456.40] and making sure you stay confused and
[2455.36 - 2460.00] making sure you stay
[2456.40 - 2462.88] sick you have to stay sick
[2460.00 - 2463.92] you have to yeah now it's about coffee
[2462.88 - 2465.68] and tumeric right
[2463.92 - 2468.24] exactly take turmeric which is actually
[2465.68 - 2470.32] a great a great healing tool right
[2468.24 - 2471.36] and now mix it in with coffee right
[2470.32 - 2473.28] exactly let's
[2471.36 - 2474.72] let's see you know that's what i mean
[2473.28 - 2476.48] let's see how many people just
[2474.72 - 2478.00] buy into it because of the addiction of
[2476.48 - 2481.52] coffee right
[2478.00 - 2482.96] and it's it's actually evil when you
[2481.52 - 2486.00] think about it
[2482.96 - 2486.40] but you know who who might say anything
[2486.00 - 2488.64] i guess
[2486.40 - 2489.68] everybody just do what you want to do
[2488.64 - 2491.12] but
[2489.68 - 2492.48] the bottom line and still gonna i'm
[2491.12 - 2494.16] still gonna love you i'm never gonna
[2492.48 - 2495.60] it's not about shaming i'm never gonna
[2494.16 - 2497.84] judge you

[2497.84 - 2503.36] addictions all of them
[2499.52 - 2507.12] so i'm never gonna judge you ever ever
[2503.36 - 2509.28] because it's not your fault you're
[2507.12 - 2511.60] addicted it's not your fault that the
[2509.28 - 2514.08] industry's found a way to brainwash you

[2532.00 - 2534.96] and the fatigue
[2533.12 - 2536.24] and the energy loss instead of fixing
[2534.96 - 2539.76] that problem right
[2536.24 - 2542.08] instead of recognizing we have a crisis
[2539.76 - 2544.96] in the united states we got a we got a
[2542.08 - 2547.92] crisis worldwide
[2544.96 - 2548.24] and we need to take care of women kind

[2882.56 - 2888.80] that's how it works two i mean that's
[2885.92 - 2888.80] one thing right there
[2888.96 - 2891.20] look
[2892.00 - 2896.32] i get it if if you need to sleep at
[2895.28 - 2899.60] night
[2896.32 - 2900.16] you need that warm fuzzy science and
[2899.60 - 2903.68] research
[2900.16 - 2906.24] blanket making you feel safe at night

[2920.40 - 2923.92] craving it just do you know what happens
[2925.84 - 2933.68] but you're not craving vinegar by itself
[2929.60 - 2935.60] right you're not craving it by itself
[2933.68 - 2937.68] wait so you're craving vinegar so much
[2935.60 - 2939.92] that you crack open that vinegar bottle
[2937.68 - 2941.76] and you're just drinking it is that is
[2939.92 - 2944.08] that how it works
[2941.76 - 2945.36] with vinegar you crack open the bottle
[2944.08 - 2948.64] and you're drinking it
[2945.36 - 2951.12] right i'm just curious or do you crave
[2948.64 - 2953.52] what you're putting it on

[3072.56 - 3075.68] with a cacao bar tomorrow and being that
[3074.24 - 3078.48] i know you guys are all addicts
[3075.68 - 3080.48] with cacao it's not your fault do you
[3078.48 - 3083.52] know how much cacao i could sell
[3080.48 - 3086.48] dear god you hear that in a clubhouse
[3083.52 - 3087.76] you hear that a clubhouse over there
[3086.48 - 3091.20] right jessica john
[3087.76 - 3092.32] right sharon you guys hear that kim you
[3091.20 - 3094.40] hear that in a clubhouse
[3092.32 - 3095.44] do you know i can put a medical medium
[3094.40 - 3097.76] chocolate bar out
[3095.44 - 3099.52] cacao bar ninety percent chocolate and
[3097.76 - 3101.36] everybody's gonna be all high on it
[3099.52 - 3102.96] and it'd be the medical medium one i
[3101.36 - 3104.56] could put a little honey in there
[3102.96 - 3106.16] i could have one without that a little
[3104.56 - 3108.96] bit of sea salt in there
[3106.16 - 3111.12] i could put out a chocolate bar sell
[3108.96 - 3114.40] millions of chocolate bars
[3111.12 - 3115.52] because medical medium because millions
[3114.40 - 3118.48] of medical medium books
[3115.52 - 3121.20] gone around the planet i can stop
[3118.48 - 3124.24] millions of chocolate bars
[3121.20 - 3126.32] and so what do i gain tell me
[3124.24 - 3127.60] i'm here ripping apart cacao telling you
[3126.32 - 3129.44] how it damages you
[3127.60 - 3131.12] right telling you how you guys are
[3129.44 - 3132.40] tricked and duped to eat it
[3131.12 - 3134.16] telling you how science and research
[3132.40 - 3136.16] doesn't know why your baby's sick but
[3134.16 - 3137.52] they sure as heck know why cacao is good
[3136.16 - 3139.84] for you supposedly
[3137.52 - 3140.56] i can do what am i gaining besides a
[3139.84 - 3143.52] headache
[3140.56 - 3144.80] from all the tick top trolls what am i
[3143.52 - 3149.04] gaining
[3144.80 - 3151.04] right exactly so i mean
[3149.04 - 3152.16] think about that one for just a few
[3151.04 - 3154.64] minutes
[3152.16 - 3156.16] think about that one lisa says is
[3154.64 - 3158.40] autoimmune real or just
[3156.16 - 3159.76] false label used when inflammation can't
[3158.40 - 3161.92] be explained
[3159.76 - 3163.04] but pretty much absolutely see
[3161.92 - 3165.84] autoimmune
[3163.04 - 3167.76] symptoms symptoms of what they demoted
[3165.84 - 3170.24] immune are real everybody's sick
[3167.76 - 3172.48] right but inflammation isn't just it
[3170.24 - 3173.92] right it's what causes that inflammation
[3172.48 - 3175.92] nobody knows
[3173.92 - 3177.44] right medical medium information about
[3175.92 - 3179.20] what causes inflammation
[3177.44 - 3181.36] is the only thing out there that's ever
[3179.20 - 3182.56] been sound in real answers for the first
[3181.36 - 3184.72] time in our history
[3182.56 - 3185.84] okay we talk about in the medical medium
[3184.72 - 3187.92] book spirit of
[3185.84 - 3189.60] compassion and i talk about how you've
[3187.92 - 3191.44] got the epstein-barr virus
[3189.60 - 3192.84] causing so much of that inflammation and
[3191.44 - 3194.08] then you end up with an autoimmune
[3192.84 - 3195.92] diagnosis
[3194.08 - 3198.64] okay but your body's not attacking
[3195.92 - 3201.20] itself so that's wrong out there that's
[3198.64 - 3203.76] misinformation that's a theory don't you
[3201.20 - 3207.12] love when science research
[3203.76 - 3208.00] gives you a theory and then for some
[3207.12 - 3209.68] reason we're supposed
[3208.00 - 3212.40] to believe that that's some kind of
[3209.68 - 3213.84] concrete fact
[3212.40 - 3215.92] you know and i talk about this in book
[3213.84 - 3217.52] one medical medium book one
[3215.92 - 3218.88] secrets behind chronic mystery illness
[3217.52 - 3220.40] and how to finally heal this is it the
[3218.88 - 3221.28] new edition you guys i'm holding it in
[3220.40 - 3225.04] my hands
[3221.28 - 3229.68] right holding it in my hands
[3225.04 - 3233.28] so science research is so smart
[3229.68 - 3235.56] and cause of autoimmune is unknown
[3233.28 - 3238.16] and all they can do is use a theory from
[3235.56 - 3242.08] 1953 that your body is attacking
[3238.16 - 3243.92] itself which was a theory right
[3242.08 - 3245.52] because they've never proved it or found
[3243.92 - 3248.88] out that's even possible
[3245.52 - 3252.00] it was a it was a suggestion
[3248.88 - 3253.76] and so now what science research is just
[3252.00 - 3256.80] iron clad
[3253.76 - 3261.92] 24 karat gold
[3256.80 - 3265.28] that was the 1950s the 1950s you guys
[3261.92 - 3267.44] this this rotary phone
[3265.28 - 3269.36] is technologically more advanced than
[3267.44 - 3272.56] the 1950s
[3269.36 - 3274.48] this rotary phone right here is far
[3272.56 - 3276.40] more advanced than the phones they were
[3274.48 - 3279.36] using in 1950
[3276.40 - 3283.12] when they came up with the theory that
[3279.36 - 3283.12] that your body was attacking itself
[3283.44 - 3293.20] so a 1950s theory
[3288.08 - 3297.92] right of your body attacking itself
[3293.20 - 3297.92] became 24 karat gold
[3302.80 - 3307.04] irony is it became 24 karat gold to the
[3305.84 - 3309.52] big pharma man
[3307.04 - 3311.84] because they're banking on you guys
[3309.52 - 3314.00] they're banking on you guys
[3311.84 - 3320.08] bank bank bank i'm cutting up some
[3314.00 - 3321.52] cilantro right here to put in my salsa a
[3320.08 - 3322.16] little onion in here too is what i'm
[3321.52 - 3325.20] gonna do
[3322.16 - 3327.60] they're banking on you guys
[3325.20 - 3328.56] they're driving around the range rovers
[3327.60 - 3331.92] baby
[3328.56 - 3335.28] they're range rovers yep
[3331.92 - 3336.24] big pharma they got their maserati in
[3335.28 - 3338.64] their garage
[3336.24 - 3339.52] big farmers got their range rovers in
[3338.64 - 3342.80] the garage
[3339.52 - 3345.76] big big farmers got the beamers in there
[3342.80 - 3347.92] they got their ferraris in there they
[3345.76 - 3349.36] got the rolls-royces they got their
[3347.92 - 3353.68] bentleys in there
[3349.36 - 3356.96] bmws are a joke to them
[3353.68 - 3358.08] range rovers a joke to the big pharma
[3356.96 - 3359.68] boys
[3358.08 - 3361.36] they laugh at somebody with a range
[3359.68 - 3364.40] rover
[3361.36 - 3365.68] spirit corrected me
[3364.40 - 3367.04] i was talking about range rover
[3365.68 - 3369.52] everything and spirit combat just like
[3367.04 - 3372.80] are you kidding
[3369.52 - 3374.48] bentleys and rolls right
[3372.80 - 3376.00] the big farmer boys got the bentleys and
[3374.48 - 3377.84] rolls that's what they got
[3376.00 - 3379.68] cooking in there and they're banking on
[3377.84 - 3381.28] everything they're banking on you guys
[3379.68 - 3382.88] staying sick they're banking on you guys
[3381.28 - 3383.76] getting much more sicker coming up
[3382.88 - 3386.32] pretty soon
[3383.76 - 3387.84] they're banking on all of it and then
[3386.32 - 3390.00] they got you thinking
[3387.84 - 3391.04] oh science research is going to catch me
[3390.00 - 3393.84] when i fall
[3391.04 - 3395.44] could catch me after the 50th
[3393.84 - 3398.32] neurologist
[3395.44 - 3398.96] right you guys on clubhouse jessica john
[3398.32 - 3402.00] sharon
[3398.96 - 3404.72] right right you guys
[3402.00 - 3406.88] and know it's it yeah they're gonna
[3404.72 - 3409.84] catch you
[3406.88 - 3411.76] look i'm not insulting incredible er
[3409.84 - 3412.72] doctors that have to put your broken
[3411.76 - 3414.80] bones together
[3412.72 - 3416.00] i'm not insulting the surgeons i know
[3414.80 - 3419.36] personally
[3416.00 - 3423.28] that change heart valves i'm not
[3419.36 - 3426.64] those are mechanics those are mechanics
[3423.28 - 3430.24] those are nuts and bolts you cut
[3426.64 - 3432.72] out a part you keep the person half dead
[3430.24 - 3434.24] so they don't awaken when you cut them
[3432.72 - 3437.28] open
[3434.24 - 3438.24] they you anesthesia the person to the
[3437.28 - 3441.92] point where
[3438.24 - 3444.24] they're almost dead but not dead
[3441.92 - 3446.88] i talked to a lot of anesthesiologists
[3444.24 - 3450.16] and they're like here's how it works aw
[3446.88 - 3454.64] here's how it works we gas
[3450.16 - 3458.16] them enough so we can put the knife in
[3454.64 - 3460.24] replace the parts but yet not
[3458.16 - 3462.88] kill them with the anesthesia there's
[3460.24 - 3466.48] this borderline
[3462.88 - 3469.68] right yeah
[3466.48 - 3472.80] borderline michelle miller you're right
[3469.68 - 3476.00] you're right but and so and then
[3472.80 - 3479.76] but but science is good like that
[3476.00 - 3482.24] if your body's been hurt by their traps
[3479.76 - 3483.84] all through your lifetime the cacao and
[3482.24 - 3486.00] the vinegar and your teeth are falling
[3483.84 - 3488.08] out and all this other stuff happens
[3486.00 - 3489.60] your appendix blows up because you
[3488.08 - 3490.72] caught your third variety of
[3489.60 - 3493.76] streptococcus
[3490.72 - 3495.44] and in e coli caused your diverticulitis
[3493.76 - 3496.96] you didn't know how to take care of
[3495.44 - 3498.80] yourself all these years
[3496.96 - 3500.16] and you got to get a piece of colon cut
[3498.80 - 3501.44] out i talked to surgeons you got to get
[3500.16 - 3503.04] a piece of colon cut out
[3501.44 - 3504.80] you got to get your your appendix
[3503.04 - 3506.64] removed you got to get a gallbladder
[3504.80 - 3508.24] removed because it damaged from years
[3506.64 - 3511.76] ago right
[3508.24 - 3513.76] and you got to get that done okay
[3511.76 - 3515.28] and we got some good surgeons out there
[3513.76 - 3516.72] of course we got a lot of bad surgeons
[3515.28 - 3517.92] and they make mistakes too i talked to
[3516.72 - 3519.12] surgeon he's like well man there's a lot
[3517.92 - 3521.92] of bad surgeons out there
[3519.12 - 3523.28] yeah but science and research does the
[3521.92 - 3526.40] nuts and bolts
[3523.28 - 3530.08] pretty good nuts and bolts anything
[3526.40 - 3531.28] past that it is literally just russian
[3530.08 - 3534.00] roulette
[3531.28 - 3535.36] it's russian roulette but lots of bank
[3534.00 - 3540.56] lots of bank
[3535.36 - 3540.56] rolls royces and bentleys off the
[3542.84 - 3545.84] sheeple
[3546.80 - 3552.72] and mansions too big old mansions and
[3550.24 - 3552.72] yachts
[3555.12 - 3559.92] yep that's right i know because i was
[3558.80 - 3561.76] talking to my friend
[3559.92 - 3563.12] fly on the wall right you guys know
[3561.76 - 3566.32] flying the wall
[3563.12 - 3567.52] you know our friend fly right he's seen
[3566.32 - 3570.24] it
[3567.52 - 3570.24] he's seen it
[3571.20 - 3574.96] yep that's right
[3575.68 - 3583.28] all right let me get a fork
[3578.88 - 3584.88] three and a four got some cilantro and i
[3583.28 - 3586.56] got to get some onion in here now let me
[3584.88 - 3590.40] grab an onion
[3586.56 - 3590.40] trying to finish up the salsa you guys
[3591.76 - 3594.88] it's like this every time i play onion
[3593.76 - 3597.76] games it's always an
[3594.88 - 3597.76] onion game right
[3598.32 - 3602.48] it's like i don't have enough onions but
[3600.16 - 3604.48] yet i have too many onions but yet
[3602.48 - 3606.08] sometimes the onions they go bad when
[3604.48 - 3607.52] they're sitting around too long right
[3606.08 - 3611.12] you guys know how it works that just
[3607.52 - 3611.12] squirted onions juice in my eyes
[3612.32 - 3616.32] that's what i love about live right
[3614.08 - 3616.32] there
[3618.16 - 3620.48] all right
[3621.60 - 3630.80] we're gonna be crying
[3628.56 - 3633.44] let's get a little red onion in this you
[3630.80 - 3635.36] don't need a lot of red onion in here
[3633.44 - 3638.00] lorraine did you see that you see the
[3635.36 - 3638.00] onion squirt
[3639.52 - 3646.96] that's one for the record books huh
[3643.60 - 3646.96] seaweed hero did you see that
[3650.96 - 3658.16] loon did you see that all right you guys
[3656.16 - 3661.12] i'm making a really simple salsa let's
[3658.16 - 3662.80] put some lime in there
[3661.12 - 3665.28] the reason why you guys don't see me use
[3662.80 - 3667.44] salt is because you guys have so many
[3665.28 - 3668.16] deposits of salt inside your body you
[3667.44 - 3671.28] don't know
[3668.16 - 3671.92] here's how salt works did you know you
[3671.28 - 3675.12] can have
[3671.92 - 3675.76] salt crystallizations crystallizations
[3675.12 - 3678.24] of salt
[3675.76 - 3679.52] inside your liver inside organs
[3678.24 - 3682.32] connective tissue
[3679.52 - 3684.00] salt deposits inside your brain that are
[3682.32 - 3685.28] not being productive they're not working
[3684.00 - 3686.08] you guys on clubhouse this is really
[3685.28 - 3689.16] important
[3686.08 - 3690.56] these salt deposits they become these
[3689.16 - 3692.88] crystallizations
[3690.56 - 3695.12] that eventually get seen on an mri as a
[3692.88 - 3698.40] mystery condition
[3695.12 - 3701.84] do you know that we salt ourselves to
[3698.40 - 3705.60] death we fat ourselves to death
[3701.84 - 3708.48] okay and then science and research
[3705.60 - 3710.48] throws studies that are useless at us to
[3708.48 - 3714.24] death
[3710.48 - 3716.56] it's it's it's insane we caffeine
[3714.24 - 3719.84] ourselves to death
[3716.56 - 3723.28] yeah we vinegar ourselves to
[3719.84 - 3728.32] death we alcohol ourselves to death
[3723.28 - 3728.32] that's what we do yeah we do
[3728.64 - 3732.16] salt deposits can sit inside you and not
[3731.52 - 3735.44] dissolve
[3732.16 - 3738.32] did you know that they can crystallize
[3735.44 - 3740.96] and trap cells and cells get all
[3738.32 - 3744.00] dehydrated in these clumps inside your
[3740.96 - 3744.00] body did you know that
[3744.56 - 3748.08] yeah that's how it is
[3750.24 - 3754.56] so we keep on dumping more salt we salt
[3752.64 - 3755.68] ourselves to death dump more salt dump
[3754.56 - 3757.20] more salt you know what
[3755.68 - 3759.76] you know what some idiotic trainer is
[3757.20 - 3759.76] going to tell you
[3760.08 - 3765.04] put a pinch of salt in your in your
[3762.32 - 3767.52] water grab a pinch of salt in your water
[3765.04 - 3768.48] you need salt grab a yeah you should be
[3767.52 - 3772.08] getting it from like
[3768.48 - 3775.76] celery and spinach and lemons
[3772.08 - 3776.80] lemon has sodium in it natural occurring
[3775.76 - 3780.08] sodium
[3776.80 - 3781.04] right the real kind and it's okay if you
[3780.08 - 3783.52] guys use a pinch
[3781.04 - 3784.16] of really high quality salt okay here
[3783.52 - 3786.48] and there
[3784.16 - 3787.44] it's just that the reason why i'm so hey
[3786.48 - 3789.36] no salt
[3787.44 - 3790.80] because so many of you guys have salt
[3789.36 - 3793.84] packed in your
[3790.80 - 3794.64] body it's packed in there it's packed
[3793.84 - 3798.08] away
[3794.64 - 3800.16] in there okay and restaurants and foods
[3798.08 - 3801.20] and vegan food and all that is loaded
[3800.16 - 3803.28] with salt
[3801.20 - 3805.36] that's that we've been trained to have
[3803.28 - 3807.28] that salt taste
[3805.36 - 3809.44] needing that salt lick like being
[3807.28 - 3811.36] addictive to sodium
[3809.44 - 3812.88] we can be addicted to the bad sodium
[3811.36 - 3814.16] because our body wants the good sodium
[3812.88 - 3817.60] but instead of drinking the celery juice
[3814.16 - 3817.60] we're going to pound all this bad salt
[3818.72 - 3821.76] i'm going to put a little cayenne in the
[3820.16 - 3823.36] salsa so get ready for that
[3821.76 - 3825.44] i got a couple different options right
[3823.36 - 3828.88] here i got this dried
[3825.44 - 3830.72] cayenne right and i still got to make a
[3828.88 - 3832.72] little bit of a salad real quick too
[3830.72 - 3834.16] so let me do that let me put a little
[3832.72 - 3835.28] let me put a little bit of the super
[3834.16 - 3839.44] chili in here
[3835.28 - 3842.16] okay a little bit of the super chili
[3839.44 - 3842.16] let's do that
[3843.44 - 3846.96] i'm not mincing this super chili really
[3846.08 - 3848.72] intensely
[3846.96 - 3850.84] because i know that if i mince it more
[3848.72 - 3855.44] and more that salsa is going to be real
[3850.84 - 3855.44] hot it's gonna be real hot
[3856.64 - 3862.64] it is it is all right so i got a nice
[3859.44 - 3866.96] salsa a real easy one vinegar free
[3862.64 - 3870.24] vinegar free one step to reversing a cut
[3866.96 - 3873.12] from a knife that's right
[3870.24 - 3874.40] thousand cuts death by a thousand cuts
[3873.12 - 3876.64] just reverse the cut
[3874.40 - 3878.24] boom didn't add vinegar in there boom
[3876.64 - 3878.84] didn't add a whole bunch of lump of salt
[3878.24 - 3881.76] in there
[3878.84 - 3885.92] boom just reverse two cuts
[3881.76 - 3886.88] see right let's go the opposite
[3885.92 - 3889.44] direction
[3886.88 - 3891.28] instead of instead of the direction that
[3889.44 - 3892.24] the alternative movement wants you going
[3891.28 - 3895.36] into 24
[3892.24 - 3896.96] 7 just a slow direction to your death
[3895.36 - 3899.12] but yet they get they take away your
[3896.96 - 3900.40] processed foods right on clubhouse you

[4170.40 - 4177.68] uh uh kind of keto carnivore
[4174.16 - 4180.32] um diet yeah
[4177.68 - 4182.16] not eating much anything else trying to
[4180.32 - 4184.24] keep my bloating down keep my weight
[4182.16 - 4186.56] right
[4184.24 - 4188.88] what what do you mean what do you mean
[4186.56 - 4193.28] that's the atkins diet
[4188.88 - 4194.92] no it's not it's a carnivore diet
[4193.28 - 4198.00] you mean it's just the atkins diet from
[4194.92 - 4202.00] 1980 what
[4198.00 - 4205.20] and it never it didn't fix anybody
[4202.00 - 4206.40] i thought it was new i was watching a
[4205.20 - 4209.12] youtube i thought it was
[4206.40 - 4211.20] new i thought it was the carnivore diet
[4209.12 - 4212.88] keto diet carnivore diet all that kind
[4211.20 - 4214.96] of thing you know keep your carbs out
[4212.88 - 4216.48] the whole bet just do meat maybe some a
[4214.96 - 4218.24] little bit of like a hard cheese or
[4216.48 - 4221.44] something
[4218.24 - 4224.32] that's the atkins diet really
[4221.44 - 4227.04] it's already been there done that people
[4224.32 - 4227.04] lived and died
[4227.76 - 4232.16] really so i'm just a new fool trying it
[4233.12 - 4236.40] but i'm feeling better on the carnivore
[4234.56 - 4239.60] diet i'm just eating meat
[4236.40 - 4240.40] a few eggs and the hard cheese it's
[4239.60 - 4242.80] because
[4240.40 - 4244.64] i got rid of like so much of the other
[4242.80 - 4246.16] crap i was eating yeah true i was eating
[4244.64 - 4248.00] a lot of stuff i was having pizza on the
[4246.16 - 4249.84] weekends too
[4248.00 - 4251.76] all right so what do you suggest
[4249.84 - 4252.80] something better so you're saying it was
[4251.76 - 4254.48] already done
[4252.80 - 4256.32] it was done over and over again why do
[4254.48 - 4257.12] people keep on getting tripped then like
[4256.32 - 4259.60] me
[4257.12 - 4261.84] how am i why are people constantly
[4259.60 - 4264.00] getting tricked then
[4261.84 - 4265.44] because every five years no one knows
[4264.00 - 4268.08] history
[4265.44 - 4269.60] so we just don't know history we don't
[4268.08 - 4270.84] know any of our history then we don't
[4269.60 - 4272.24] know all the mistakes that have been
[4270.84 - 4273.84] made
[4272.24 - 4275.36] we don't know how many people died from
[4273.84 - 4277.20] antibiotic treatments with lyme disease
[4275.36 - 4279.44] they just they're all gone
[4277.20 - 4281.36] so there's no history like oh history
[4279.44 - 4283.84] repeats itself constantly because of all
[4281.36 - 4286.00] the screw-ups they're never really
[4283.84 - 4287.36] oh they're never really taught to
[4286.00 - 4290.96] anybody so what
[4287.36 - 4293.84] what do people learn in school though
[4290.96 - 4295.68] so no one's being taught the constant
[4293.84 - 4298.48] mistakes over and over again
[4295.68 - 4301.04] including in health all the disasters we
[4298.48 - 4305.04] just repeat it over and over again
[4301.04 - 4306.56] oh all right i gotta think about that
[4305.04 - 4308.24] gotta wash this cucumber for a second
[4306.56 - 4311.92] you guys
[4308.24 - 4313.44] yeah hey did you ever think about that
[4311.92 - 4317.04] one right there
[4313.44 - 4319.20] yeah it's kind of funny had a doctor
[4317.04 - 4322.16] called me up a while back
[4319.20 - 4323.92] i haven't talked to him in years it says
[4322.16 - 4326.48] aaw
[4323.92 - 4329.04] like what i'm trying this new carnivore
[4326.48 - 4332.08] thing a patient told me to try it
[4329.04 - 4333.28] i'm like really didn't you try that many
[4332.08 - 4334.32] years ago because what are you talking
[4333.28 - 4335.68] about
[4334.32 - 4337.28] i said didn't you try that many years
[4335.68 - 4338.96] ago that was the atkins diet many years
[4337.28 - 4340.00] ago he goes you're right i never even
[4338.96 - 4341.36] thought about that
[4340.00 - 4342.64] i go didn't the atkins do that the
[4341.36 - 4344.08] acting side didn't work for you right
[4342.64 - 4344.64] that's what you told me that's what he
[4344.08 - 4346.24] said
[4344.64 - 4347.84] i'm not saying anything bad about it or
[4346.24 - 4350.32] not not
[4347.84 - 4351.60] not saying anything bad about it but he
[4350.32 - 4353.28] said no it didn't work for me i said
[4351.60 - 4357.12] well you're redoing it

[4372.72 - 4376.48] you know i like adding the salsa to my
[4374.80 - 4377.68] salad this is a little side salad i like
[4376.48 - 4379.20] adding my salsa to it
[4377.68 - 4382.08] i'm just chopping up a little bit of the
[4379.20 - 4382.08] cucumber right here
[4383.68 - 4387.04] yeah lorraine i had to run out for that
[4385.68 - 4391.52] cucumber
[4387.04 - 4391.52] i can't win i can't win
[4394.40 - 4398.00] i'll tell you you guys the whole tomato
[4396.96 - 4400.56] thing's a night shirt
[4398.00 - 4402.32] the nightshade thing the nightshade fear
[4400.56 - 4404.00] that happened
[4402.32 - 4405.84] can i give you a little can i give you a
[4404.00 - 4408.40] little inside scoop on something
[4405.84 - 4410.24] you guys are you're okay for this you
[4408.40 - 4414.00] guys are in clubhouse roger
[4410.24 - 4416.08] right all you guys there john right jess
[4414.00 - 4418.32] and all you guys out there right did you
[4416.08 - 4418.96] know that you know where tomato got the
[4418.32 - 4422.08] bad
[4418.96 - 4425.60] wrap right we used to have
[4422.08 - 4427.12] lead plates so everybody ate off of lead
[4425.60 - 4430.72] plates
[4427.12 - 4434.16] 100 years ago or more right and
[4430.72 - 4435.36] so what happened was anything that had
[4434.16 - 4438.96] any kind of
[4435.36 - 4441.76] acid right like anything
[4438.96 - 4443.68] that was kind of slightly even anything
[4441.76 - 4446.96] moist or wet
[4443.68 - 4450.08] right so like cucumber cut
[4446.96 - 4452.56] open in pieces or tomato
[4450.08 - 4453.68] cut open in pieces okay this is
[4452.56 - 4456.96] important to know
[4453.68 - 4461.20] right anything wet or
[4456.96 - 4464.64] a soup in a lead bowl
[4461.20 - 4466.72] okay anything like that would bring the
[4464.64 - 4469.60] lead out
[4466.72 - 4470.32] you get more lead off the plate anything
[4469.60 - 4472.88] wet
[4470.32 - 4475.44] that had any kind of mineral composition
[4472.88 - 4477.12] tomatoes are high in minerals
[4475.44 - 4479.76] right anything with a mineral
[4477.12 - 4481.68] composition tomato
[4479.76 - 4483.12] any kind of soup any kind of fruit
[4481.68 - 4484.64] anything and
[4483.12 - 4486.32] what it would do is when you put
[4484.64 - 4487.84] anything like that in any kind of
[4486.32 - 4490.40] minerals any foods
[4487.84 - 4491.28] plant foods with minerals in them tomato
[4490.40 - 4495.04] being a real
[4491.28 - 4497.20] wet juicy mineral rich food
[4495.04 - 4499.60] with a little bit of that acid right you
[4497.20 - 4502.64] put that in that lead bowling lead plate
[4499.60 - 4504.88] and then you draw the lead out
[4502.64 - 4506.48] and that's why tomato and a whole bunch
[4504.88 - 4509.92] of other foods got a bad rap
[4506.48 - 4512.00] many years ago soup had a bad rap a
[4509.92 - 4514.72] hundred years ago from lead plates
[4512.00 - 4516.24] lead bowls people would be poisoned
[4514.72 - 4517.92] after eating their soup
[4516.24 - 4519.44] and then they'd be going through what in
[4517.92 - 4521.52] the soup just poisoned me
[4519.44 - 4524.08] because now you know my husband's laying
[4521.52 - 4526.24] down he can't even breathe or move
[4524.08 - 4528.16] we're all sick here at the table what
[4526.24 - 4530.40] was it so everybody's like somebody
[4528.16 - 4532.64] poisoned soup somebody poisoned the soup
[4530.40 - 4534.48] but what was happening is we started to
[4532.64 - 4538.32] learn that eating off of
[4534.48 - 4542.24] lead plates and bowls was really a bad
[4538.32 - 4545.68] idea and the tomato caused
[4542.24 - 4549.44] like caught a bad wrap because
[4545.68 - 4550.96] there used to be fried green tomatoes
[4549.44 - 4552.96] fried green tomatoes fried green
[4550.96 - 4554.48] tomatoes that was a big thing
[4552.96 - 4556.16] fried green tomatoes that was a big
[4554.48 - 4558.48] thing many many years ago
[4556.16 - 4559.20] that was a really big thing and it was
[4558.48 - 4561.60] fried in
[4559.20 - 4563.52] oil and juice and all that and they
[4561.60 - 4565.20] would go on the lead plate and
[4563.52 - 4568.40] it would just kind of that wetness would
[4565.20 - 4570.08] just bring out that lead
[4568.40 - 4571.76] okay it's one of the reasons why i took
[4570.08 - 4574.96] a bad rap
[4571.76 - 4576.96] not because of night shade
[4574.96 - 4579.44] everybody was eating off of lead plates
[4576.96 - 4582.00] a lot of things took the bad rap too
[4579.44 - 4583.44] a lot of things took the bad wrap so you

[4731.76 - 4735.52] i'm turning the clubhouse back on just
[4734.08 - 4736.00] give me a few minutes i got to clean up
[4735.52 - 4740.48] the
[4736.00 - 4743.36] space for a little bit and remember
[4740.48 - 4744.64] you're you're a high chaser until you're
[4743.36 - 4746.72] taught
[4744.64 - 4748.24] that they wanted you to be a high chaser
[4746.72 - 4751.12] and then you learn
[4748.24 - 4752.96] how to back out of that high chasing
[4751.12 - 4754.08] sustain yourself
[4752.96 - 4756.16] and when i if i hear that word
[4754.08 - 4758.64] sustainability one more time i hear that
[4756.16 - 4761.44] word fair trade one more time
[4758.64 - 4764.00] all i do is i kind of line that up too
[4761.44 - 4766.72] how about if we sustain ourselves
[4764.00 - 4767.60] how do we learn how to sustain ourselves
[4766.72 - 4769.44] how do we learn
[4767.60 - 4771.52] how to be fair to ourselves and our
[4769.44 - 4774.24] bodies you know
[4771.52 - 4775.68] and we need to switch those words around
[4774.24 - 4777.76] really take care of us instead of
[4775.68 - 4780.80] downing a whole bunch of
[4777.76 - 4782.08] cacao or matcha tea because it's
[4780.80 - 4784.56] sustainable
[4782.08 - 4786.24] and i'm sorry there's nothing about
[4784.56 - 4788.96] cacao that's sustainable
[4786.24 - 4790.40] nothing they're torturing people who cut
[4788.96 - 4792.64] down that stuff right now
[4790.40 - 4793.92] on this planet it's an evil industry i
