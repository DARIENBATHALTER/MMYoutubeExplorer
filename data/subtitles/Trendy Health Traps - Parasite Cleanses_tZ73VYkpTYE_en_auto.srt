00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,680
cleanse kind of

49
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:42,320
died out it already gave people 20 years

50
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:45,040
of a ride lots of different parasitical

51
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,399

52
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,240
okay

53
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,720
already gave them a ride

54
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,880
it already did its thing it burnt itself

55
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:55,200
out it bros up a little bit and then

56
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,960
burnt itself out and died

57
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,680
an ugly death

58
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,960
right

59
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,759
but now

60
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:04,799
it is coming back same thing with

61
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:06,719
alkaline ionizer water machines okay

62
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,239
because not going to ionize the water

63
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,840
machines they've been around they've

64
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,560
been around all those years no one got

65
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,840
better you go and buy expensive water

66
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,239
machine

67
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,760
and you're drinking your alkaline water

68
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,520
you still got your aches and pains

69
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,560
tingles and numbness ticks and spasms

70
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,160
brain fog neck and back pain you still

71
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,920
got your fatigue

72
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,400
and all those machines went into

73
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,239
everybody's closet

74
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,360
again it went into everybody's closet

75
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,680
right

76
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,480
you know which ones stand out and you

77
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,760
know which ones don't stand out because

78
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,239
back then

79
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,959
that died in ugly death too so the

80
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,920
ionizer water machine world just went

81
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,319
tanked

82
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,319
right and then social media picked up

83
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:50,400
and social media picked up

84
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:52,160
okay same thing coffee enemas people did

85
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,560
the coffee enemas coffee enemas all

86
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,239
those years ago coffee enemas

87
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,159
they did them they did them didn't fix

88
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,599
them made them sicker

89
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,400
didn't fix them

90
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,720
right

91
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,840
and then that kind of died

92
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:09,440
an ugly death that kind of died

93
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,400
but then social media came on and then

94
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,560
boom

95
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,879
everything started picking up

96
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,800
right coffee enema supplies started

97
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:19,440
picking up let's get it out there

98
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:22,720
alkaline ionizer water machines parasite

99
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:26,000
cleanses right i'm just naming a few

100
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:29,519
few trendy traps just a few

101
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,519
there's dozens okay dozens

102
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,599
but social media picked up

103
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,959
and then the marketing happened to

104
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,879
marketing

105
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,840
all the heavy marketing

106
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:40,319
right

107
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,640
and then the incentives with all the

108
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,560
marketing with the trendy traps

109
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,400
but none of those things and so many

110
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,200
more like the rife machine

111
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,840
that was a disaster disaster the rife

112
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,599
machine back 20 years ago

113
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,200
people buy the rife machine and sitting

114
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:56,879
there you know with the right machine in

115
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,200
their hand

116
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:01,200
and then boom still their neurological

117
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:05,280
symptoms burning skin aches and pains

118
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:08,080
ringing in the ears tinnitus vertigo uh

119
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,439
severe brain fog floaters in the eyes

120
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,599
neck pain back pain all these other

121
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:13,599
issues still stayed there but you still

122
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:16,239
had your rife machine

123
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:18,160
right but then like i said everything

124
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:20,799
changes all this money gets dumped into

125
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:23,440
all these things to revive them they die

126
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:25,520
this ugly death

127
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,320
all of these things all did throughout

128
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:31,600
the years and then they get revived

129
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:33,280
they get revitalized by money

130
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,520
because now we've got a whole new world

131
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,199
got the social media world and just dump

132
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,120

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,440
bunch of money into things

135
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,360
and get them back up oh buy a rice

138
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:52,240
to lay on okay i'll get uh maybe i'll

139
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,600
pick up a hyperbaric oxygen chamber you

140
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,880
know people laid in those things and

141
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,400
laid those things and laid in those

142
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,919
hyperbaric oxygen chambers they never

143
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,600
got better

144
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,680
when they were sick really sick when

145
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,280
they had the neurological lyme and they

146
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,520
had all the other conditions right

147
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,520
people have that now okay

148
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,720
man they've been around those oxygen

149
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,520
chambers

150
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,280
but everybody was stuck

151
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:16,000
everybody was stuck

152
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,520
right and then by default people started

153
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,960
learning through medical medium tools

154
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,720

224
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,440
all these other different things right

00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:42,319
you had these right and

226
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:44,960
at the same time

229
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,840
weren't moving forward so these things

230
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,520
would be all stuck in people's closets

231
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,680
that's where they would be it's like a

232
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,599
whole closet full of all this stuff

233
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,520
you'd have the mat in there you'd have

00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,120
but

238
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,120

right

243
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:15,599
it's like everybody's got a parasite

245
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:19,919
doctor of like not a conventional doctor

248
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,960

252
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,919

maybe do a coffee enema under boot with

259
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:47,360
your bentonite clay

260
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:49,760
it was endless it was always like this

261
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,720
it was always like this

262
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,680
this is

263
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,519
what life was like back then but now

264
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,399

revive themselves

268
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,959
people get on board with a ton of money

269
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,519
and

270
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:10,080

288
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,920
needle when nothing else could

289
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,680
when nothing else could

290
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,360
when all these people

291
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,880
seasoned people who've been through hell

292
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,399
and back who tried everything they tried

293
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,160
all the clays they tried all this they

294
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,880
tried diatomaceous earth particles they

295
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,080
tried the apple cider vinegar

296
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,920
they tried all these different

297
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:05,680
techniques and things they tried ozone

298
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:07,600
therapy right tried ozone therapy

299
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,959
and all of a sudden

300
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,279
they said you know they heard from

301
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:13,040
somebody else or heard medical medium or

302
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,560
heard something from his book or heard

303
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,320
from another person

304
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,880
or maybe who recommended it because of

305
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:22,000
medical meaning they heard about the

306
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:24,160
celery juice and they start drinking it

307
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,360
and something changes

308
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,240
really changes the needle starts to move

309
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,360
right

310
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:33,040
starts to move but here's what's funny

311
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,440
there isn't hundreds and hundreds of

312
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,839
millions of dollars invested into

313
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,000
brainwashing you to drink celery juice

314
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,519
in fact it's the opposite

315
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,680
did you guys know

316
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,519

00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,640
there wasn't a single article positive

321
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,560
about it

322
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:57,120

323
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,640
everything they had the media

324
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,040

00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:54,639
not really

350
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,399
could do anything it's just a vegetable

351
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,680
yeah you can chop it up and throw it in

352
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,880
something

353
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:03,120
you can

354
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:04,399
have a celery stick and a carrot

355
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,320
and

356
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,680

00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,880
okay

358
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,880

361
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,200
millions of dollars

362
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:20,079

00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,279
to shut this down

364
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,480
millions

365
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:24,720

about alkaline ionizer water machines

381
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:58,160
because yeah because i'm part of the

382
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,160
pyramid scheme

383
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:03,600
and it was that that got me better not

384
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,639
the celery juice

385
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,639
and

386
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,639
but the celery juice

387
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:10,240
has turned so many lives around at this

388
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,639
point

389
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:15,120
it's really unbelievable

390
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,560
but it's also an eyesore it's been an

391
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,480
eyesore

392
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:21,279
one thing is the celery

393
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,480
powders like celery juice powders that

394
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,160
came to town because they were trying to

395
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,160
hop on the bandwagon well that got

396
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:29,200
crushed pretty much

397
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:30,800
because we know through the books and

398
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,720
all the information talking about it

399
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:35,200
that the powders don't work

400
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,040
so they really can't they can't really

401
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,800
get as far as they need to go it's a

402
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:41,120
fresh celery juice

403
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:44,160
we know that you freshly juice with your

404
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:46,800
juicer or you go into a juice bar and

405
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:49,199
you buy it right freshly juiced that

406
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:51,760
turn that turns things makes things

407
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:54,480
happen that makes things happen

408
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,680
that gets you better

409
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,600
so

410
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,800
the one thing about the trendy traps out

411
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,880
there is they're still out there and

412
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:03,199
there's still many of them out there

413
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,000
lots of trendy traps

414
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,600
and

415
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
the parasite one i was talking about

416
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:11,360
because that one's making a comeback

417
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:14,320
because of the parasite cleanses

418
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,720
because of the parasite probiotic stuff

419
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:21,199
because the microbiome talk

420
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:24,160
but fecal matter implants

421
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:24,160
coffee enemas

422
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:30,399
various probiotics with all this stuff

423
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:33,760
in it including clays and bentonite clay

424
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:35,519
really are not the answer

425
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,800
they're not

426
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:40,160
i'll give you a little run down on

427
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:42,839
parasites just for a quick second here

428
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:46,240
if you catch a

429
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:48,240
parasite you die

430
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:51,199
or the parasite dies

431
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:53,360
there's no in between

432
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:56,880
there's no in between

433
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:59,440
you drink some bad water

434
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,720
right out of a puddle

435
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,480
you drink

436
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,480
some water

437
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:07,120
out of a pond

438
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:09,279
and you get a parasite

439
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,760
you [ __ ] your brains out

440
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:13,920
and throw up your brains out

441
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,920
until one of you makes it whether you

442
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:19,120
sit in the hospital

443
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:21,519
on iv and painkillers until you win the

444
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,519
battle

445
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:26,959
okay or you lose the battle

446
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:29,759
there's no in between with parasites

447
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:32,079
you don't walk around with parasites in

448
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:36,399
you you don't

449
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:36,399
okay you can walk around with worms

450
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:42,639
but that's not a

451
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:44,079
parasite worms are worms

452
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:45,920
and guess what

453
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:48,079
people walk around with worms and

454
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,600
they're never sick you can walk around

455
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:51,360
with worms and eat chocolate cake and

456
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,720
pizza and there's people they're not

457
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,480
sick they don't have chronic illness and

458
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,920
they're playing tennis they're doing

459
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,720
whatever they're playing tennis they're

460
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:00,720
drinking martinis they're drinking wine

461
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:03,279
they're partying they're staying up all

462
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:06,240
night they do that to 30s and their 40s

463
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:07,680
they never got sick yet

464
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,399
it never tipped to scale with other

465
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,240
things

466
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,120
they have worms in them

467
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:15,680
yeah

468
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,680
you can live with worms in you you can't

469
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:18,959
and

470
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,160
those worms won't make you sick

471
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:23,040
unless

472
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:26,639
it's a five foot tapeworm

473
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:28,480
but you'll know and you'll know quick

474
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:32,000
now parasites

475
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:34,720
you drink some nasty water

476
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,399
you're down in mexico and you drink that

477
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,079
water

478
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:39,360
what do you think that is when you get

479
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:41,199
sick what do you think they tell you not

480
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,880
to drink the water in mexico

481
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:44,639
because when you get that parasite it's

482
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:47,040
you or the parasite

483
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:49,120
you win or the parasite wins you don't

484
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,880
keep that parasite that you picked up in

485
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,279
mexico

486
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:55,519
from that water

487
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:57,680
you don't keep it i've known so many

488
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,880
people they've gone to india

489
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,120
right

490
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,959
they've gotten a parasite

491
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,799
eating in some restaurant i know some

492
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:06,319
people here in the united states lots of

493
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:08,880
them they go into a restaurant they pick

494
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:11,280
up a parasite

495
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,120
right you're in europe you're traveling

496
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,480
and you eat something somewhere some

497
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:17,039
street food

498
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:19,839
you pick up a parasite

499
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:22,640
it's you're the parasite

500
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:24,400
you stay sick gravely sick until the

501
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:27,199
parasite's gone

502
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,640
you sit in the hospital

503
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,919
or at home

504
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,280
you barf

505
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:34,320
you [ __ ]

506
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:36,240
until the parasite's gone

507
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,640
it's one or the other you are the

508
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,400
parasite there's no living your life

509
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,240
slowly getting sick with neurological

510
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:45,200
symptoms and then getting

511
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,960
and then that's a parasite

512
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,039
living your life with these parasites in

513
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:51,039
you and you know you're slowly getting

514
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:52,640
sick and you've got neurological fatigue

515
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:55,520
and you've got problems

516
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:57,760
galore and you've got eye floaters and

517
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,120
body pain and you're going now to fancy

518
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,799
functional medicine doctor he's like

519
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,880
well you got parasites we're doing a

520
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:04,240
stool simple sample and you got parasite

521
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,600
no

522
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,200
no

523
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,799
no

524
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,640
not how it works

525
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:12,640
what you really have

526
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:16,000
are viruses

527
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:18,640
not parasites which really have

528
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:22,400
are viruses

529
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:25,280
the herpetic family is the one that's

530
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,880
the epidemic of all time

531
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:29,360
everybody's epstein-barr side of

532
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,679
megaloviruses everybody's hhv sixes

533
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:34,799
everybody's simplex ones and twos giving

534
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:36,480
them all the neurological problems

535
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:37,840
the brain fog the sicknesses and

536
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:41,679
everything else

537
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:44,080
okay and then to boot you can have

538
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:45,760
some streptococcus three four varieties

539
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:48,000
of strep

540
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,600
and what happens is that's why people

541
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
are sick

542
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:55,200
they're sick from these things

543
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,720
so the parasite trap is a trap

544
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,880
is what it is

545
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:01,280
it's a trap that started because nobody

546
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,799
knew why anyone was sick

547
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,480
alternative practitioners didn't know

548
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:05,840
why anybody's sick conventional doctors

549
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,480
certainly didn't know why everybody was

550
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,520
sick with chronic mystery illness nobody

551
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,960
knew

552
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,240
nobody knew

553
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,679
right

554
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:18,559
and so theories evolved candida the

555
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:20,559
candida trap right oh it's gotta be

556
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:22,320
candida better just try to kill all your

557
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:24,080
candida oh wait a minute maybe it's

558
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:27,200
parasites you better just try to kill

559
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,200
off all your parasites

560
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:33,600
so let's start jump you know let's start

561
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:35,520
dude maybe it's mold mold's a trigger

562
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,280
is what mold is

563
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,200
that's a trigger

564
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:41,039
that's why someone else in the household

565
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,440
can eat all the mold they want oh my god

566
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:45,360
my husband can get all the mold he wants

567
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,559
he's living in the same house i'm in i'm

568
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,720
bedridden

569
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:50,880
as his wife

570

coming and going he's eating the mold

574
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,400
he's breathing the mold

575
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:03,200
because he

576
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:05,520
doesn't have the things in his body

577
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:08,080
the other person has

578
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:11,200
see how mold works molds a trigger to

579
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:13,440
lower your immune system so viruses come

580
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,679
out to play

581
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,679

00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,280
so we go on these

583
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:21,840
searches

don't know what's doing what right

600
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,760
you're not sick enough so you don't know

601
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:58,000
what's happening anyway you get sick

00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:59,440
enough and you get seasoned enough along

603
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,120
the way

604
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,400
and you're sick or seasoned enough in

605
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,880
that and you've been sick chronically

606
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,480

anyway

610
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,840
it's important stuff when you think

611
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:20,240
about it there are millions of dollars

612
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,600
going in to taking out taking down

613
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,919
celery juice

614
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:26,720
just so you know

615
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:29,200
there's all kinds of propaganda about

616
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:31,280
you you'll have skin problems when

617
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:34,080
you're drinking celery juice

you won't be able to go into the sun

619
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,640
that's insanity

620
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,559
it's not just

621
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:43,039
some simple

622
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:44,360
attacks

623
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:47,520
it's

624
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:49,280
premeditated paid for attacks

625
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,240
out there

626
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:53,360
because

627
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:56,320
the power of celery juice

628
00:21:53,360 --> 00:22:00,320
is such a threat

629
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:01,919
to conventional and alternative medicine

630
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,440
an incredible threat to alternative

631
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:06,159
medicine by the way

632
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:08,080
i'll turn to medicine people oh man they

633
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:09,200
hate it tooth and nail

634
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,720
even though there's lots of doctors

635
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,159
using it their patients are coming in

636
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,880
they're using it lots of people go

637
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:16,960
coming in using it but it just really

638
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,799
gets everybody's goat for a lot of

639
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,559
reasons because

640
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:21,919
it's really annoying here you are you

641
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:23,360
don't know why anybody's sick to begin

642
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:24,880
with you're trying to push all these

643
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,960
other things on them right and then

644
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:29,760

it's turning people's lives around is

665
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,400
one of the powerful tools medical mean

powerful tools but it's one that's

667
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:18,720

673
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:33,840
viruses

675
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,360
right

676
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:39,679
everybody being held up

678
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:43,120
right

679
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:46,400
just losing track of the months

680
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:47,279
right world turned upside down

681
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,880
right

682
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:52,880
are we kind of realizing

683
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:56,400
the same way

684
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:58,640
you know the viral the plague happens

685
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,799
all these decades

686
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,400
herpes family of viruses have been

687
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:04,559
released

688
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,640
into the environment

689
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:08,120
the epstein bars the shingles

690
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:12,320
cytomegalovirus

691
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:14,159
hhv-687 hhv 9 through 16 all the

692
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:16,480
undiscovered varieties all the strains

693
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:19,120
and mutations

694
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:21,360
and epstein-barr is a funny one

695
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:23,919
same thing with simplex one too and same

696
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:26,320
things with shingles is you can have

697
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:28,480
more than one variety and when you have

698
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:31,279
more than one variety of those viruses

699
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,559
inside the human body you can

700
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:34,799
spawn

701
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:36,960
a new mutation and then you pass that

702
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:38,480
mutation on to somebody else

703
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,000
they're sick with their neurological

704
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,039
lyme symptoms

705
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,279

fatigue syndrome

708
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:50,360
fibromyalgia ra

hyperthyroidism

711
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,320
okay thyroid problems in general

712
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,440
hypothyroid in general

713
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:01,120
right

714
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:03,919
these are just a few eczema psoriasis

715
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:05,520
you need a virus in there too did a ligo

716
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,919
you need a virus in there too it's not

717
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:10,559
just the metals that i teach about right

718
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:12,400
you need the viruses in there

719
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:13,679
but the viruses

720
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,360
right there

721
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:18,960
are the big deal

722
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:20,960
it's why people are sick bell's palsy

723
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:23,679
that's the shingles virus

724
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:26,799
trigeminal neuralgia that's the shingles

725
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:28,320
virus but here's the sad part

726
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:30,640
you can be suffering from trigeminal

727
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:34,799
neuralgia have some bell's palsy at the

728
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:37,200
same time have chronic fatigue brain fog

729
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:38,799
go to your different doctors

730
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,440
and someone will just say oh it's a

731
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:43,600
parasite doing it and now it's just a

732
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,919
guessing game and a guessing game so now

733
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:49,840
it's just a total guessing game back to

734
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:51,200
that and the musical chairs go on

735
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:54,799
so

736
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,799
what i love about celery juice

737
00:25:54,880 --> 00:26:00,559
is its power and what it does

738
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:03,360
and you know trigeminal neuralgia not

739
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:05,520
just the shingles simplex one

740
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:07,360
simplex one can actually bring on that

741
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:10,400
trigeminal neuralgia too

742
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:12,000
teeth clenched inning jaw tightening

743
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:14,400
but someone might think hey well that

744
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,080
fever blister i have right

745
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,320
a fever blister

746
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,919
it's gone it only shows up once in a

747
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:24,000
while when i'm stressed out and then i

748
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:26,960
get this fever blister it's simplex one

749
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,840
all these viruses were raised

750
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:34,240
they were raised in labs

751
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:36,640
with eggs as their incubator

752
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:38,960
and they were created

753
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,320
they proliferated and then they were

754
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,840
released

755
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,400
purposely

756
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:47,039
into our environment

757
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,720
in many creative ways

758
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:51,120
many creative ways

759
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:54,799
which is why we have the epidemic of

760
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:57,360
chronic illness today right now

761
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:59,440
you see why celery juice is such a

762
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:01,360
threat

763
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,440
but it's a threat

764
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:06,240
to more than conventional medicine and

765
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:08,640
big pharma and pharmaceuticals

766
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,720
it's a threat more to anti-anxiety

767
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,480
medications antidepressants that make

768
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,400
the world go around right and all the

769
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,760
other medications and blood clotting

770
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,520
medications and all kinds of different

771
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:20,320
medications right not only is it a

772
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:21,840
threat to all the different meds the

773
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:23,120
opioid

774
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,440
epidemic

775
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:27,679
big pharma cells all the opioids right

776
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:30,240
this is not just the threat to all of

777
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:32,840
that it's a threat to the massive

778
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:35,679
conglomerate massive

779
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:37,279
industry the alternative medicine

780
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:39,360
industry

781
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:41,200
and all the different fads and trends

782
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:43,679
that were in the past that never got

783
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:45,360
people better like really better after

784
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:47,600
everything they've been through and the

785
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:50,240
money jumped into it to rise those

786
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:52,399
things up and rise them up

787
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:54,559
so it becomes now the war on the

788
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:56,640
chronically ill

789
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:58,720
because how's the chronically ill person

790
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,480
gonna find their way

791
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:04,080
especially when a whole bunch of [ __ ]

792
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:06,320
has always talked about celery juice

793
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:08,480
because you won't see nothing positive

794
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,679
out there because no one's spending the

795
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,480
money

796
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:14,799
to write it of course you guys say

797
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,880
things positive about celery juice and

798
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:18,960
the person next door does and the person

799
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,799
down the street does right and i'm

800
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:23,760
saying things that are positive about it

801
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:25,440
right so we're saying positive things

802
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,679
but no

803
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:30,559
industry

804
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:32,080
nobody behind there's writing

805
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:35,840
all these

806
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:38,640
fake bogus articles of positivity

807
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:40,159
and then putting it out there

808
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,320
about something like they do but

809
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:44,559
everything else like they do with the

810
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:46,640
ionizers and they do with all the

811
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:48,640
different other things and like they do

812
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,159
with all the different gut products and

813
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,320
everything else anything that anybody

814
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:54,159
wants to sell they're in the clays

815
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:56,080
and the coffee enemas so all these

816
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:57,840
things get written about these things

817
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:00,320
because the money and the engine

818
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:02,159
involved to do would not just write it

819
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:05,200
but to get it in the system so it

820
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:08,480
doesn't get kicked down

821
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,480
so it doesn't get kicked down

822
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,880
and

823
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:15,840
celery juice doesn't have any of that it

824
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:17,919
just has the word on the street

825
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:19,919
the word of the people

826
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:22,480
how pure is that

827
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:24,840
it's got the organic movement the word

828
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:28,320
of the people on the street healing

829
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:30,399
right not millions perpetuating like the

830
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,840
apple cider vinegar narrative so that

831
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:33,440
you think apple cider vinegar is what

832
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:36,399
you need to be on when the stuff rips

833
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:38,000
you apart and it dissolves your teeth

834
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:39,600
the money involved in apple cider

835
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,440
vinegar is

836
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:43,520
you could not even hundreds of millions

837
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:45,679
of dollars go into advertising that to

838
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:47,520
shove it down everybody's throat

839
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:49,200
yeah there isn't hundreds of millions of

840
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:51,679
dollars shoveling shoving down celery

841
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,760
just down your throat it's a threat to

842
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:55,679
everybody else in the industries

843
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:57,600
so it becomes this thing where

844
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:59,440
it's underground

845
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:03,440
it's like one of those things it's

846
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,440
incredible really every last bit of it

847
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:10,159
you guys if this this sale was actually

848
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:14,640

849
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:14,640

if you got it then you know what i'm

857
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:38,399
talking about it's quiet

858
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:39,600
right i love that

859
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:41,840
but

860
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:44,720
and i just i hear about it all the time

861
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,840
right now is people are buying less

862
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,000
celery

863
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:50,399
it adds up and then you end up paying

864
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,600
for your juicer

865
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,470
okay

866
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,799
and

867
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:56,880
[Applause]

868
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:59,440
how cool is that right

869
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,559
i get asked every day what juicer do i

870
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,600
use

871
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:05,679
all the time okay and you can use any

872
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:07,919
juicer you can use your own juicer if

873
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:10,399
you want whatever like if you or any

874
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:12,399
juicer juicing celery juice is

875
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:15,200
incredible

876
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:18,000
this is a cold pressed juicer the pulp

877
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:21,519
comes out dry

878
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,519
so the pulp comes out dry

879
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:25,519
and

880
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:28,080
that matters because if you have to buy

881
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:29,679
two heads of celery

882
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:32,399
now

883
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:34,159
i have to only buy one or

884
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:36,880
if you're someone that has to buy six

885
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:39,039
heads or something for the week or eight

886
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:41,480
heads of celery for the week

887
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:42,880
right you might be buying five

888
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:44,960
[Music]

889
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:47,200
instead of eight or something right

890
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:48,720
three extra heads on the house that's

891
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:51,039
how it works and that's what this juicer

892
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:54,000
does it's like three extra heads of

893
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:55,760
celery that goes in the bank and then it

894
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,279
adds up it's another two dollars here

895
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,640
another two dollars another five dollars

896
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:59,919
here then eight dollars another ten

897
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,279
dollars here next thing you know you

898
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:02,559
paid for the juicer over again and

899
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:04,399
you're like what

900
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:06,960
and that's what i love about the juicer

901
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:09,039
it pays for itself i'm pretty sure this

902
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:13,279
one from my calculations has paid for

903
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:13,279
itself way over a dozen times

904
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,880
and

905
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:19,200
that extra money you can buy other food

906
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:21,600
so not only do you have their medicine

907
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:24,159
but you're saving extra money to buy

908
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:25,919
your other food right so not only do you

909
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:28,399
have your herbal medicine but you're

910
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:30,320
saving you're saving money

911
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:31,760
to you know

912
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:33,840
to buy your other food and that's what i

913
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,880
love about the juicer that's like one

914
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,720
thing there

915
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:38,399
you know and

916
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,320
i got a lot of reasons why i like it

917
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:44,000
like the other thing is doesn't have the

918
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:47,200
metal gears grinding into each other

919
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,600
then the centrifuge ones burns

920
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:51,519
it the centrifuge ones where it's just

921
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,880
like they make all that noise and you're

922
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:55,440
running it down the chute and it's

923
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:57,919
spitting out right and all that well

924
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,519
those centrifuges right

925
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:01,840
they're burning the juice so they're

926
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:03,919
heating it up and just kind of scorching

927
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:05,679
it

928
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:07,679
and i'm not a fan of that

929
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:09,919
this is a cold pressed juicer but then

930
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:11,360
somebody be like wow there's better cold

931
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:13,200
pressed juicers out there oh really

932
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:15,440
because those are the metal gears

933
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:17,279
rubbing against each other

934
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:20,080
so uh

935
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:21,840
it's not better than this

936
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:24,480
[Music]

937
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:26,399
and so that's why i really love this one

938
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,720
i love the fact it's quiet because i

939
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:30,799
juice really early in the morning

940
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,640
or i'll juice before i go to bed so if

941
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:33,919
i'm working on the book you guys like if

942
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,679
i'm working the book till four in the

943
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:37,200
morning or something

944
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:40,399
and

945
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:41,440
i don't want to wake up the house

946
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:44,240
so

947
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:46,559
i could juice at 4 30 in the morning

948
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:48,399
before i even went to bed

949
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:50,399
after working on the book

950
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:54,960
and not wake up the house and then get a

951
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:54,960
celery juice in me as i'm going to sleep

952
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:01,200
i know that's not a healthy lifestyle

953
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:03,039
the celery just parts a healthy

954
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:06,080
lifestyle but i know

955
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:07,760
going to sleep at 4 30

956
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,520
in the morning or five in the morning

957
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:11,119
it's not a healthy lifestyle but i've

958
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,720
had to do it a lot when writing the book

959
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:14,480
because once then when you're in the

960
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:15,440
groove and

961
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,280
you're listening to the spirit of

962
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,720
compassion and getting this incredible

963
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,320
information down

964
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:21,760
sometimes you just don't want to quit

965
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:24,000
for the day

966
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:26,000
you want to get as much as you can

967
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,760
but yeah

968
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,760
and then you know wake up eight o'clock

969
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:32,320
in the morning after that and then start

970
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:34,320
all over again

971
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,599
but i love the juice for a lot of these

972
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:37,679
reasons

973
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:38,800
um

974
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:40,560
look

975
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,159
if everybody

976
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:44,240
was all set with their juicer and they

977
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:47,520
weren't asking about it

978
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:50,159
be great i probably have more time to

979
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:52,079
do some other stuff right

980
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:53,760
but right after the sale everybody's

981
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:55,919
gonna say where can i get a juicer and

982
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:58,520
then they're paying full price

983
00:34:55,919 --> 00:34:58,710
and then i'm like oh god i feel bad

984
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,880
[Music]

985
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:02,720
[Applause]

986
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,400
so when there's a sale on the juicer i

987
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:06,320
just want to let you guys know because

988
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:08,320
this way look maybe we can get some

989
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:10,000
people that don't have to pay full price

990
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:12,480
don't feel good about it

991
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,480
it's 50 off right now and at the same

992
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:16,960
time you know the celery just broken two

993
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:19,440
glass bottles for free

994
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,440
with it

995
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,240
but

996
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,790
all right we got plenty there plenty of

997
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,540
celery juice right there

998
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:26,079
[Music]

999
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:27,920
[Applause]

1000
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:29,119
give you some tips tips that i've always

1001
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,040
given you and i'll talk about what it

1002
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:32,880
does for you too i want to run it by i

1003
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,320
think i want to go deeper into that a

1004
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,480
little bit about the celery juice and

1005
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:39,520
why it's so important so go into a

1006
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:41,440
deeper on a deeper level okay

1007
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:43,839
which is really great

1008
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:48,240
i'll strain it first you want to strain

1009
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:50,480
it first of all this pulp right it's dry

1010
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:52,079
and i you know i was at my friend's

1011
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:54,400
house the other day

1012
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:56,800
and he had a different juicer

1013
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:59,760
and it was it was just spitting out all

1014
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:01,599
the wet pulp became a wet mush in there

1015
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,599
and then what he had to do is he had to

1016
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:04,880
take that pulp and he had to put it back

1017
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:07,359
on the machine

1018
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:09,280
and it didn't give him really much juice

1019
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:12,079
after that but it still came out sloppy

1020
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:13,920
and wet i said you can stick it back in

1021
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:15,680
over and over again all you want but it

1022
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,440
doesn't have that same it doesn't have

1023
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:19,520
that design to actually squeeze the

1024
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:21,520
juice out so he gave up because it was

1025
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:23,040
just coming out wet and sloppy

1026
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,720
and just coming out wet and sloppy what

1027
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:27,599
what that was what it's doing it was

1028
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:29,599
terrible right and so that's dry there's

1029
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:31,760
no juice on the bottom of this it's like

1030
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:33,680
dust that the stuff just comes out like

1031
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:35,359
you know and

1032
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,160
so that's important

1033
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:38,240
um

1034
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:40,160
it's like basically air dry the hole

1035
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:43,680
which i love

1036
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:43,680
gotta strain it okay

1037
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,800
so

1038
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:52,640
doing that now

1039
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:57,680
seems like i'm spilling this one for

1040
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:59,040
some reason i haven't spilled it in like

1041
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:01,040
a week

1042
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:02,640
when i'm making it every morning

1043
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:05,599
but i lost a little

1044
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,599
i'm gonna do that

1045
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:09,280
so how about if i just get everything

1046
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,200
moved out of the way so i don't there

1047
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,480
you go

1048
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,720
tip

1049
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,079
don't don't strain it

1050
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:18,560
while you're trying to do it over the

1051
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:22,079
juicer like that make yourself some room

1052
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:23,920
so you don't make a mess

1053
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:26,720
try to do some weird thing when you got

1054
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,720
the juicer right there

1055
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,720
simple as that

1056
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,920
i should have probably moved the juicer

1057
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:36,320
out of the way

1058
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:38,640
giving myself some space so i wouldn't

1059
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,599
make a mess

1060
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,640
so

1061
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:42,240
these are some of the things i love

1062
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:43,119
about the juicer which is incredible

1063
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:46,079
right

1064
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:48,839
so let's talk about like what it does

1065
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:52,160
for us okay

1066
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:54,320
so why do it

1067
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:56,720
it's like why do it okay so i have that

1068
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,720
right there

1069
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:01,850
just cut into that a little bit i want

1070
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:03,359
to get this over here

1071
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:04,480
[Music]

1072
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:05,440
okay i'm going to give you a couple of

1073
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:07,119
different

1074
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,800
rundowns on why the cellar is just so

1075
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:11,119
good we're going to talk about the heart

1076
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,400
a little bit too as well

1077
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:15,359
so

1078
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:17,599
why are people easily blood clotting

1079
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:19,680
people have been blood clotting for

1080
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:21,920
decades and decades

1081
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:24,079
and decades okay

1082
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:27,520
and one of the reasons why they blood

1083
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:30,240
clot if they have any toxins or poisons

1084
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:31,440
inside their blood

1085
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:35,119
right

1086
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:36,560
and the blood is too thick

1087
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:38,320
they're gonna get set up for a blood

1088
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:39,680
clot

1089
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:42,079
they're gonna be

1090
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:44,960
eligible for a blood clot that's

1091
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:47,040
important to know so when the blood

1092
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,720
is too thick

1093
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:51,200
and then you have a buildup of too many

1094
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:52,480
toxins too many poisons

1095
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,560
right

1096
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:56,160
chronic dehydration

1097
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:58,960
that's another thing too

1098
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:01,680
and too much fat floating around or

1099
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:03,119
stuck inside the arteries the heart okay

1100
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:04,960
and all through the body and in the

1101
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:06,320
veins you're gonna get set up for a

1102
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,920
blood clot

1103
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:10,320
celery juice

1104
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:12,720
not only hydrates properly because it's

1105
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:15,040
a complete electrolyte right not only

1106
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:17,280
does it hydrate properly

1107
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,280
okay

1108
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:21,680
but

1109
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:24,560
it's a natural blood thinner

1110
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:26,079
without it being ever a problem

1111
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:29,040
what that means is

1112
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:32,640
it starts to break up that fat meaning

1113
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:34,480
start to dissolve fatty deposits

1114
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:36,720
that shouldn't be there the fatty

1115
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:38,480
deposits that actually cause

1116
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:41,680
problems blood clots other things like

1117
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:43,520
that so it's it's the cleaner upper

1118
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:45,119
where it starts to dissolve

1119
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:47,920
the poison

1120
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:50,800
it starts to neutralize it it even binds

1121
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:54,240
on to it to pull it out

1122
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:56,400
and that alone is like incredible really

1123
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:58,640
right there that's that's the winner

1124
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:00,240
right there all on its own it's cleaning

1125
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:01,440
your blood

1126
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:03,920
there's a whole bunch of people there

1127
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:05,680

00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:11,920
somebody who knows all about lymphatic

1132
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,520
they're going to give me all kinds of

1133
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:15,280
tonics i'm like okay well where's the

1134
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:17,040
celery juice

1135
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:18,720
because you can do all the lymphatic

1136
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:20,319
stuff you want you can do all your

1137
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,599
little lymphatic lenses and all your

1138
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:23,359
different tricks and you can do your

1139
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:25,920
massage too

1140
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:27,359
but you can't clean that lymphatic

1141
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,280
system up

1142
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:30,880
until you use like tools that really

1143
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,319
work like celery juice is one of those

1144
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,880
tools that's why people start getting

1145
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:36,319
better another another reason why

1146
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,760
celery juice works on cleaning up the

1147
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:39,440
lymphatic system is because it's fixing

1148
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:41,280
the liver

1149
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,800
your lymphatic system's only as good as

1150
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,640
your liver

1151
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:46,960
you have a dirty liver and that's not

1152
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:48,480
being fixed your lymphatic system is

1153
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:50,400
going to be never ending it's going to

1154
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:52,079
be the never ending trash pile like the

1155
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:54,480
garbage patch out on the west coast

1156
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:56,720
right in the pacific

1157
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:59,520
it's now way bigger than texas

1158
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:01,839
it's far bigger and it's moving now to a

1159
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:03,520
point where it's pushing to the coast

1160
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:05,040
to the west coast

1161
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:07,280
the problem with the garbage patch

1162
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:09,040
pushing to the west coast

1163
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:10,480
is it squeezing out the wildlife so

1164
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:13,040
people are starting to see wildlife

1165
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:15,839
that's not supposed to live on the coast

1166
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:18,720
so i was talking to a friend of mine

1167
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:20,800
and he said he saw wildlife studies fish

1168
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:23,680
he says he saw fish that live way out

1169
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:25,920
there and don't live on the coast

1170
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:26,960
and they're finding fish that's pushed

1171
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,200
out

1172
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:31,280
so because the garbage patch is now

1173
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:33,200
moving to such a rate right well if your

1174
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,400
liver is that toxic like the garbage

1175
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,720
patch

1176
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:38,880
and it's that filled up with junk and

1177
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:40,079
stagnity and all kinds of toxins and

1178
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:42,800
everything else

1179
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:45,520
your lymphatic system

1180
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:47,680
is part of that garbage patch

1181
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:48,960
you you can clean the lymphatic all you

1182
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:50,480
want

1183
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,160
you can do all the cleansers and things

1184
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:53,680
that are you know all theoretical or

1185
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:56,079
whatever you want to do

1186
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:58,160
but unless you clean up the liver

1187
00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:00,480
it's not going to happen

1188
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:02,240
it's just not it's like cleaning up the

1189
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,839
coast it's like walking on the west

1190
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:06,160
coast right now on the beach and

1191
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:08,319
cleaning up garbage meanwhile there's

1192
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:09,839
this massive monstrosity out in the

1193
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:11,680
water in the pacific that's just

1194
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:14,480
gobbling everything up no one's going

1195
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:17,359
out there to clean that up

1196
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:19,680
and that's the liver

1197
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:21,520
that's the monstrosity problem of all

1198
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:23,599
the junk and garbage that's where it

1199
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:25,040
really is centered for everybody you got

1200
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:26,160
weight gain that's coming on and you

1201
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:28,560
can't get rid of that weight gain or

1202
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:30,319
that weight gain's problematic

1203
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:32,000
and you're doing everything you can but

1204
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:33,520
you know you can barely control the

1205
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,240
weight gain

1206
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:38,079
that's the liver saying hey i had enough

1207
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:39,599
i'm filled with toxins i'm filled with

1208
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:41,520
poisons i'm filled with all kinds of

1209
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:42,480
trouble all kinds of different things

1210
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,240
and

1211
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:47,200
petrochemicals and solvents and

1212
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:49,280
everything else metals

1213
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:50,560
everything's in there right perfumes

1214
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:52,400
colognes

1215
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:54,960
all of it and

1216
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:56,880
so how do we clean up that liver

1217
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:58,800
including any kind of viral sludge or

1218
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:00,240
things like that in there

1219
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:02,000
how do we clean up the liver well celery

1220
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:03,839
juice is actually one of those things so

1221
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,760
now you're you're hitting you're

1222
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:08,720
pinpointing

1223
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:10,560
you're doing pinpoint

1224
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:12,160
you're locking it down

1225
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:14,800
you're actually locking it down you're

1226
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:16,000
using the celery juice to go into the

1227
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:18,079
liver

1228
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,200
start cleaning up that garbage patch

1229
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:21,040
right there

1230
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:22,640
and then the lymphatic system actually

1231
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:25,520
lymphatic system actually that's the

1232
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:27,599
next that just naturally starts to clean

1233
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:29,599
up

1234
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:32,240
it's why you could be 40 something years

1235
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:34,160
old and you've like eaten really lean

1236
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:36,640
meats or or you're vegan and you're

1237
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:38,880
eating you know good quality vegan food

1238
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:40,480
and you're working out you're exercising

1239
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:42,240
and then you die of a heart attack

1240
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:43,680
happens every day

1241
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:46,079
every day

1242
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:47,760
and you're like this guy that's running

1243
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:49,280
on a treadmill

1244
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:50,640
pushing weights

1245
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:52,720
in great shape

1246
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:54,480
dies of a heart attack at 42 years old

1247
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:56,160
you think that's just one guy out of 10

1248
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:59,440
000. oh my god it's so many guys it's

1249
00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:00,640
unbelievable and women too

1250
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,880
and

1251
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:05,520
because we're not addressing the real

1252
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:07,599
issue the center that storm in the

1253
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:09,680
center here right so celery juice is

1254
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:11,200
that great weapon that great tool you

1255
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:12,319
can use every single day so when you're

1256
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:14,560
drinking your celery juice you're like

1257
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:16,960
you're really cleaning your lymphatic

1258
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:18,720
system you're really cleaning your liver

1259
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:21,040
that's just you know yeah it's one of

1260
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:24,160
the medical medium tools there's others

1261
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:25,599
too you can combine

1262
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:28,400
but that one right there is really

1263
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:30,480
important and there's good reason for it

1264
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:32,000
and then your intestinal tract

1265
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:33,680
so you go to the functional medicine

1266
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,480
doctor and he's going to be caught onto

1267
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:37,839
the trends of microbiome and oh you're

1268
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:39,200
going to need all this fermented foods

1269
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:41,040
and microorganisms and that's your

1270
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:42,640
problem guess what's been done

1271
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:45,119
been done before and everybody still

1272
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:46,800
stays sick who's chronically ill

1273
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:48,319
sure if they get rid of your gluten and

1274
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,760
your eggs they don't know why you start

1275
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:51,200
getting better you get rid of your glute

1276
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:53,119
and your eggs and you get rid of your

1277
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:54,560
dairy you get rid of processed foods you

1278
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:56,720
might be somebody that's not sick and

1279
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:58,400
all of a sudden you start seeing some

1280
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:00,880
some benefits so you think oh he's got

1281
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:02,079
something there maybe my microbiome but

1282
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:03,520
really

1283
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:04,480
what you have

1284
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:06,960
is

1285
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:08,240
a whole bunch of different bacteria

1286
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:10,560
like the bad bacteria like the

1287
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:12,240
streptococcus and you got the viruses

1288
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:13,920
like the epstein barr

1289
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:15,839
that's why you got the brain fog and you

1290
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:18,720
got the fatigue and the sickness and the

1291
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:21,440
fibromyalgia and all the other issues so

1292
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:22,960
what happens is that when you go

1293
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,920
to your functional doctor or somebody

1294
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,880
which is great you got to have a

1295
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:26,480
functional doctor you got to have

1296
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:28,079
somebody you love but when they start

1297
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:29,839
pushing the parasite cleanses and

1298
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:31,359
everything else

1299
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:32,960
that's really not the direction the

1300
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:36,240
direction

1301
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:37,119
is going after the bacteria

1302
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:39,040
right

1303
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:41,680
with something that kills it but doesn't

1304
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:43,920
kill the good bacteria another thing too

1305
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:45,119
is a big confusion that people have

1306
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:46,560
is that

1307
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:48,560
they think you can put in all these

1308
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:50,880
microorganisms and that pushes out the

1309
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:51,920
bad stuff it doesn't they don't battle

1310
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:54,240
each other

1311
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:56,880
they're not against each other so

1312
00:45:54,240 --> 00:46:00,640
bad microbes in your intestinal tract

1313
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:03,359
don't go at war with good microbes

1314
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:05,359
so you can push all the theoretical

1315
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:08,000
microbes you want or fermented

1316
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:09,200
microorganisms or probiotics you want in

1317
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,599
your gut

1318
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:13,599
but it'll never push out while you're

1319
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:15,599
the reason why you're sick it'll never

1320
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:17,280
push the reason why you're sick out it's

1321
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:19,280
why so many people with fatigue and the

1322
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:21,119
brain fog and the aches and pains and

1323
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:23,920
the vertigo and the dizziness and the

1324
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:25,839
balance issues and the jaw pain the

1325
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:28,480
trigeminal neuralgia the bell's palsy

1326
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:30,240
the back pain neck pain the sciatica the

1327
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:32,079
plantar fasciitis and everything else

1328
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:35,040
they don't get better

1329
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:37,839
because you can't push out a problem

1330
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:39,920
using good bacteria

1331
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:41,520
that's impossible bad bacteria and good

1332
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:43,520
bacteria don't battle each other they're

1333
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:45,040
not at war with each other they're not

1334
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:47,520
against each other

1335
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:48,880
so you can push anything you want in you

1336
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:50,400
that you think is theoretically a

1337
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:51,680
microorganism that your body might want

1338
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:53,920
to receive

1339
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:55,760
you put it in there you still stay sick

1340
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:58,960
or you keep on waving back and forth

1341
00:46:55,760 --> 00:47:00,480
back and forth confused

1342
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:02,079
so

1343
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:04,560
i'm just and that's thousands and

1344
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:06,079
thousands and thousands of dollars right

1345
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:07,200
going in this specialist and this

1346
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:08,640
specialist now i got to see my

1347
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:10,079
neurologist now i'm going to try this

1348
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:11,839
new cleanse now i'm going to try fecal

1349
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:14,240
matter in plants now i'm going to try

1350
00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:15,359
more probiotics now you're in and then

1351
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:17,040
i'm going to do this cleanse this

1352
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:18,240
therapy i'm going to get blood work so

1353
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:20,400
that's another thing too and then

1354
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:21,920
they'll bleed you to death

1355
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:23,280
so

1356
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:24,559
so you got to know how to protect

1357
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:27,200
yourself because the next thing you know

1358
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:28,880
it now they're bleeding you to death

1359
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:31,440
more blood more blood at the doctor's

1360
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:32,319
office more blood more blood

1361
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:35,599
oh

1362
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:36,880
parasites more stool samples more blood

1363
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:38,240
and

1364
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:41,040
now we're down another you know we're

1365
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:43,040
down a path even deeper into it

1366
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:44,640
so this is thousands upon thousands of

1367
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:45,920
dollars if you have health insurance

1368
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:48,000
okay

1369
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:49,920
i guess so a lot of it the co-payments

1370
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,359
alone kill people so i don't know and

1371
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:53,200
then all the different therapies are not

1372
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:54,240
covered many of them

1373
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:56,319
but

1374
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:57,520
that's why celery juice is such

1375
00:47:56,319 --> 00:47:59,359
a threat and these people are already

1376
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:01,280
deficient everybody you guys know like

1377
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:02,240
everybody's deficient

1378
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,599
right

1379
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:05,200
everybody's deficient already they have

1380
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:06,960
blood drawn from them they're already

1381
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:10,160
deficient

1382
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:11,760
they got adrenals already deficient

1383
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:13,839
stomach lands already deficient they

1384
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:15,119
can't produce the gastric acid they need

1385
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:18,160
to produce

1386
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:19,760
everything's already deficient okay and

1387
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:21,839
people's teeth are falling apart why do

1388
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:23,359
you think all the podcast doctors all

1389
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:25,280
have fake teeth

1390
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:27,760
i have you guys figured it out yet i

1391
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:29,119
mean it's just unbelievable it's it's

1392
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:30,559
incredible really

1393
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:32,000
got all these guys there of course they

1394
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:33,280
got all their teeth done they got the

1395
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,720
implants and the veneers and everything

1396
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:37,280
else i'm not saying that's a bad thing

1397
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:38,160
if you want but the point is is

1398
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:40,800
that

1399
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:43,200
there's deficiencies in everybody

1400
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:45,440
everybody's running deficient rampant

1401
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:47,599
and what are we putting back in us

1402
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:48,880
i think the celery juice is incredible

1403
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:50,160
because you not only kill the bad

1404
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:52,800
bacteria

1405
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:54,400
but you're restoring

1406
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:56,319
and restoring

1407
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:58,079
so you're restoring back into you're

1408
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:59,440
putting back in

1409
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:00,800
to the bank

1410
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:02,160
and that's the key

1411
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:04,720
that's the big thing right there you're

1412
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:07,599
putting back into the bank

1413
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:09,520
and i love that you're also helping to

1414
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:11,359
not just kill off the bad bacteria in

1415
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:12,880
the gut because it neutralizes it breaks

1416
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:14,559
down the membrane of bacteria and

1417
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:18,480
viruses

1418
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:20,319
but it flushes out dehydrated

1419
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:22,240
gristle that everybody has in their

1420
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:25,839
intestinal tracts everybody has this

1421
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:27,760
dehydrated fat dehydrated gristle all

1422
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:30,000
wrapped up inside their intestinal tract

1423
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:32,000
lining they got all this gristle there

1424
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,240
and so it starts to break that apart so

1425
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:37,280
we end up getting rid of that

1426
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:39,200
way better than sodium bicarbonate trend

1427
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:43,200
diatomaceous earth particle

1428
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:44,480
uh trend fulvic mineral trend whatever

1429
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:46,000
and

1430
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,880
what happens is

1431
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,400
that

1432
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:50,079
we're on all these different trends

1433
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:52,559
they're being paid for out there

1434
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:54,000
non-stop lots of money going in and then

1435
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:55,440
we're told

1436
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,680
celery juice

1437
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:59,920
what that that's a vegetable it's not

1438
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:01,280
going to be enough meanwhile what it's

1439
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:02,640
done for people and turning people's

1440
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:04,160
lives around is just absolutely

1441
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:05,680
extraordinary

1442
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:07,200
the thing is when people get their blood

1443
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:08,559
removed constantly and they get vials of

1444
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,599
blood removed constantly and that's

1445
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:12,559
what's happening when we go to our

1446
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:14,640
practitioners it doesn't restore your

1447
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:16,800
immune system doesn't come back in a

1448
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:20,640
week or a day your immune system doesn't

1449
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:22,559
come back in three days or four days

1450
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:24,720
critical electrolytes don't even come

1451
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:27,119
back that fast and we're already

1452
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:29,440
deficient so we get more deficient so we

1453
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:30,880
get the blood drawn all the time and

1454
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:32,640
then we're getting more deficient and

1455
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:35,119
more deficient it doesn't just all

1456
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:37,280
restore in three days or five days you

1457
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:40,720
just can't have everything fixed you get

1458
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:43,839
the blood work we just lost critical

1459
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:46,400
needed macro minerals those don't get

1460
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:47,440
restored really fast

1461
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:49,599
and then

1462
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:51,040
our cbc doesn't get restored very fast

1463
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:53,200
because we're sick to begin with we're

1464
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:55,280
already deficient we've already have a

1465
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:57,280
low immune system we already have a

1466
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:59,839
struggling immune system if you guys are

1467
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:02,400
sick we're already struggling so

1468
00:50:59,839 --> 00:51:04,000

00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:05,680
