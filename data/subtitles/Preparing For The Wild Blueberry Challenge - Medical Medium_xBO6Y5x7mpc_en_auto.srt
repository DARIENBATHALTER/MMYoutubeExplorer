the description so I'm excited so you

102
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:19,320
know I want to just say a couple things

103
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:21,900
about like the wild blueberry it's

104
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:24,419
underappreciated underestimated under

105
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:26,820
under known all of those things right

106
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:30,240
we're talking about a wild food there's

107
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:32,100
a big difference between a wild food and

108
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,680
then a not wild food that's one thing

109
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:38,040
and the other thing too there's a big

110
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:40,860
difference between a filler food that's

111
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:43,139
not necessarily a healing food and a

112
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:46,740
healing food there's a big difference

113
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:49,680
between a healing food and a filler food

114
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:52,320
right so we eat food but some foods

115
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,780
they're just not healing foods they're

116
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:58,080
filler Foods they don't have the power

117
00:04:54,780 --> 00:05:00,000
to be a healing food they may not be a

118
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,919
bad food but they don't have the power

119
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,419
to be the healing food right so when

120
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:08,820
you're talking about a wild food

121
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:10,740
especially this blue blue blue wild food

122
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:12,960
you're talking talking about survival

123
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:15,780
Instinct you're talking about wild

124
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:18,660
survival Instinct been around for

125
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:21,300
thousands upon thousands of years

126
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:24,720
literally have gone through

127
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:28,860
everything under the sun drought floods

128
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:31,259
all of it right Tundra cold Tundra and

129
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:34,199
it's here another thing too is

130
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:36,360
which I want to mention is you can burn

131
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:38,699
the wild blueberry down to the ground

132
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,740
and it will rise out of the ashes and

133
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:43,620
that's what I want in my body like I

134
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:47,280
want in my body something that has

135
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:49,320
survival Instinct you can burn it to the

136
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,320
ground and it rises out of the ashes

137
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:55,020
that's what I want inside my body that's

138
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:57,419
the key right there that's a big one so

139
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:59,340
it's not just about antioxidants because

140
00:05:57,419 --> 00:06:03,000
lots of things do have antioxidants it's

141
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:05,400
about what kind of antioxidant do I want

142
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,639
an antioxidant that's been in something

143
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:12,440
that has survival instincts something

144
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:15,720
that has adapted for thousands of years

145
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:18,720
right do I want that antioxidant to me

146
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:20,100
that anthocyanin that blue anthocyanin

147
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,259
or do you want do I want another

148
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:23,819
antioxidant to me and that's the

149
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:26,460
difference right there since one of the

150
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:27,600
reasons why I always loved while the

151
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,800

152
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,120

00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:32,940

197
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,560

actually take a wild food

234
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:30,959

to get this powerful antioxidant food

245
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:02,640

like two as well are you ready to drink

296
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:05,279
your shot chickadee another question why

297
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:06,839
isn't Wyman's wild blueberries organic

298
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,339
well I've talked about this many times

299
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:11,160
and I will talk about it during the

300
00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:14,339
challenge and what that means okay it's

301
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:17,640
a wild food meaning it takes care of

302
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:22,200
itself got to keep that in mind a wild

303
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:24,300
food has an immune system that's why

304
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:26,880
it's important that's why it has

305
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:29,399
survived thousands of years that's why

306
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,620
it needs barely any care whatsoever

307
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:34,320
that's why you can burn it to the ground

308
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:35,820
and it will come back up I want to talk

309
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,760
about that for a second

310
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:41,160
okay oh another thing too Wyman's

311
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:44,339
doesn't use pollinator killers

312
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:45,440
and guess what organic food crops where

313
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:48,300
they spray

314
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:50,940
organic food is sprayed with pollinator

315
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:53,700
Killers it's sprayed with nicotine a

316
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:56,160
pollinator killer all the bees die when

317
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:59,459
it's sprayed with nicotine think about

318
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:02,040
that so Wyman's they don't do any

319
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:05,220
spraying and when they have to Once in

320
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:06,779
so many years or whatever one field the

321
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:08,399
whole thing is it's not a pollinator

322
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:11,300
killer and here's the other thing too

323
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:13,200
they always they test and there's no

324
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:15,420
pesticides at all so there's no

325
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,760
pesticides pesticide residues in their

326
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:20,160
tests so they are an incredible wild

327
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,480
food wild food company and people don't

328
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:24,000
realize this when you're dealing with

329
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:27,720
wild Foods you're dealing with less need

330
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:30,240
to have to care because the food defends

331
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:32,639
itself and protects itself and that's

332
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,500
something people don't realize so what

333
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,820
they do is everybody's like oh well what

334
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:39,660
it's not a game but they don't realize

335
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:42,860
it's oh it's above organic wild food is

336
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:45,360
above organic in everything

337
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:47,880
phytochemical compounds antioxidants

338
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,920
it's above organic and people don't

339
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:52,260
realize that that's the difference right

340
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,300
there I can go on forever about that and

341
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:55,200
I will talk about that more

342
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,700
um

343
00:13:55,200 --> 00:14:00,600
so and Wyman's is going to let me know

370
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,139
about that too seriously really

371
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,880
important

372
00:14:58,139 --> 00:15:01,800
see you guys we're doing the wild

373
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:03,060
blueberry challenge a three-day wild

374
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,459
Blu-ray challenge I'm already getting

375
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:08,220
drunk on the juice we're doing the three

376
00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:11,760
day wild blueberry challenge

377
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:13,260
15 through the 17th I'm excited I'm

378
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,940
going to be there

379
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:16,860
I'm gonna be there

380
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:18,899
so

381
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:21,120
what do we have here oh Natasha gray

382
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:24,240
says hello I want to be a part of it all

383
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,800
I am in Mexico and cannot get my hands

384
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,620
on wild blueberries I know nothing

385
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:30,360
compares to them but would love to know

386
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:32,100
what I can do

387
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:34,620
if you cannot for some reason get wild

388
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:36,540
blueberries it won't be the same power

389
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:38,699
as like if you do the regular

390
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:41,040
blueberries it won't be the same kind of

391
00:15:38,699 --> 00:15:44,639
incredible thing if you can try

392
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:47,100
blackberries as as blackberries are more

393
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:50,519
potent and stronger than a regular

394
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:53,040
cultivated blueberry so if you go to

395
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:55,019
the grocery store in Mexico you can't

396
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:57,300
get the wild blueberry

397
00:15:55,019 --> 00:15:59,459
just keep in mind that if you get the

398
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:01,440
cultivated blueberry the big blueberry

399
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:03,180
and the clam shells that's not going to

400
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:06,300
do it you're better off getting the

401
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:08,279
Blackberry in the store the blackberries

402
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:10,860
more powerful than the cultivated

403
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:12,360
blueberry but not more powerful than the

404
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:14,399
wild blueberry but more powerful than

405
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:16,139
the cultivated blueberry so if you have

406
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,940
to do some blackberries that's something

407
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:20,639
you do but there's got to be a way even

408
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:24,540
in Mexico to figure out how to get

409
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:26,820
some type of wild a blueberry product

410
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:28,860

you're talking about the power

524
00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:57,059
of the Earthly mother you're talking

525
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:59,340
about the power it provides you're

526
00:20:57,059 --> 00:21:02,460

527
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:05,960
thousands upon thousands of years you're

528
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:08,280

529
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:10,799

you're talking about everything and

532
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:17,640
anything when it comes down to Wild

533
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:19,320
bloomers and the survival rate of the

534
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:21,299
wild blueberry you can burn it to the

535
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:23,280
ground here's the thing when someone

536
00:21:21,299 --> 00:21:25,140
just said to me the other day right

537
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:27,539
why do you say when the wild blueberry

538
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:30,659
Burns at the ground and it comes back

539
00:21:27,539 --> 00:21:33,059
doesn't everything come back no a bird

540
00:21:30,659 --> 00:21:37,080
has to bring a seed

541
00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:40,500
a bird has to drop a seed has to poop

542
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:44,820
out a seed a squirrel has to bring in

543
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:47,760
acorn back to scorched land and plant a

544
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:50,580
new tree when you burn an oak tree down

545
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:52,080
it doesn't come back up it's not

546
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:54,120
possible I'm just telling you right now

547
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:56,340
when you burn an oak tree down they

548
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:57,780
don't come back up when you burn an oak

549
00:21:56,340 --> 00:22:00,600
tree down

550
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:02,100
it stays down and that's it and it

551
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:04,080
doesn't come back up

552
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:06,419
so it's important to know the wild

553
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:09,780
blueberries they can be burnt to the

554
00:22:06,419 --> 00:22:13,140
ground right to the Earth fire hot ash

555
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:16,919
all of it and then they come out that's

556
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:20,039
an adaptogenic power like adapting for

557
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:22,020
thousands of years of fire and flood and

558
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:24,360
freezing cold that's what I want inside

559
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:28,140
my body that's the fuel that's the food

560
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:29,700
I want inside of me that blue food

561
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:31,799
Brandon says I was going into aw

562
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:34,320
withdrawal after not seeing you after

563
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:36,780
the 10-day brain shot challenge I am

564
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:39,299
here and a phone call is probably on its

565
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:42,299
way too so I hope I try not to interrupt

566
00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:45,480
while we're doing this but it happens

567
00:22:42,299 --> 00:22:47,280
I am going through a troll myself I'm

568
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:49,440
going through a withdrawal of seeing you

569
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:51,840
guys of course because I love to be here

570
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,159
and I love to help in any way I can so

571
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,299
when it comes down to like survival

572
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:56,640
Instinct

573
00:22:54,299 --> 00:22:58,919
and adaptogenic Power

574
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:01,140
that's a big deal right there adapting

575
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:03,320
to the Earth's changes well that's the

576
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:06,740
food I want in me

577
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:09,900
antioxidants that are different

578
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:12,240
antioxidants right antioxidants that

579
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:14,520
come from a wild food with survival

580
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:17,220
Instinct that's an entirely different

581
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:19,260
story the wild blueberries not a filler

582
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:21,960
food the wild blueberry

583
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:24,600
is not a filler food right

584
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:27,120

00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:33,179

that have been here for thousands upon

654
00:25:57,539 --> 00:26:04,020

00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:15,360
