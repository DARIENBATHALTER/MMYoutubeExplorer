[9.04 - 15.76] find out what's making you sick and how
[10.92 - 18.64] to heal Anthony William is the medical
[15.76 - 20.24] medium hello I'm Anthony William and
[18.64 - 22.36] you're listening to the medical medium
[20.24 - 24.84] radio show where each week I talk about
[22.36 - 26.72] the most advanced healing information
[24.84 - 29.24] and secrets about health much of which
[26.72 - 32.16] is not found anywhere else and is
[29.24 - 34.12] decades ahead what's out there now this
[32.16 - 36.56] is the only Health show where the
[34.12 - 38.60] information here doesn't come from
[36.56 - 41.16] interest groups or medical funding with
[38.60 - 43.76] strings attached botched research
[41.16 - 46.28] lobbyists internal Kickbacks persuaded
[43.76 - 49.08] belief systems private panels of
[46.28 - 51.32] influencers and health field payoffs are
[49.08 - 53.72] trendy traps that are both in
[51.32 - 55.56] conventional and alternative medical
[53.72 - 57.96] community's
[55.56 - 60.04] information because hey all of the
[57.96 - 62.80] health information I share Here Comes
[60.04 - 65.64] from a pure untampered with Advanced
[62.80 - 67.48] Clean Source a higher source the spirit
[65.64 - 71.40] of compassion there's nothing more
[67.48 - 74.52] healing than compassion so who has 10 or
[71.40 - 76.92] 20 years to wait for answers we have to
[74.52 - 79.96] start our healing now we need every
[76.92 - 82.36] answer we can get now and as a child
[79.96 - 85.00] when the gift first came to me to hear
[82.36 - 88.16] Spirit perfectly clear and spirit
[85.00 - 90.24] appeared and gave me information for my
[88.16 - 92.96] grandmother and for other people for the
[90.24 - 96.04] rest of my life and gave me that ability
[92.96 - 97.80] to see when that first happened Spirit
[96.04 - 99.48] was saying people need these answers
[97.80 - 101.48] they need them now cuz I always asked
[99.48 - 103.52] all the time I always said well why you
[101.48 - 106.12] know who cares who cares you know when I
[103.52 - 107.88] was a kid I was like who cares I I you
[106.12 - 110.12] know I can't be bothered with this I
[107.88 - 112.48] just want to ride my bicycle I just want
[110.12 - 114.24] to do things I want to have fun I don't
[112.48 - 116.40] want to know what's going inside of
[114.24 - 118.48] people and what's going inside in in in
[116.40 - 120.28] them and what's happening and that's
[118.48 - 123.24] what I would say to Spirit spirit said
[120.28 - 125.96] you have to care you have to learn to
[123.24 - 128.52] care at a young age I had to tap into
[125.96 - 130.84] that I had to root into that and care
[128.52 - 132.64] about other people meaning truly care
[130.84 - 134.68] about other people people I didn't know
[132.64 - 136.84] people that I never really knew people
[134.68 - 139.04] that you know strangers I had to root
[136.84 - 142.36] into that it had to it had to become
[139.04 - 145.08] ingrained in me toare because we need
[142.36 - 147.24] this information and spirit taught me
[145.08 - 149.44] that this information was really
[147.24 - 152.20] important for people to know and as I've
[149.44 - 155.04] seen over the Decades of doing this
[152.20 - 156.48] being a servant to Spirit and to the
[155.04 - 158.40] people and the communities and
[156.48 - 160.36] everything else as I've seen I've seen
[158.40 - 162.20] the changes I've seen the Miracles I've
[160.36 - 165.16] seen what's happened with spirit's
[162.20 - 170.56] information and spirit was right right
[165.16 - 173.24] all along so hey Today's Show is about
[170.56 - 175.48] inflammation this is an important show
[173.24 - 177.80] it really is inflammation is is
[175.48 - 179.40] something that we need to talk about for
[177.80 - 183.44] a lot of reasons it's one of my favorite
[179.40 - 186.56] words in a way because it's it's an easy
[183.44 - 190.32] word to use like for for instance okay
[186.56 - 192.28] you guys the mistake is not trying to
[190.32 - 194.84] fix inflammation because you know I'm
[192.28 - 198.28] always always looking for mistakes it's
[194.84 - 201.76] not trying to fix inflammation or trying
[198.28 - 203.16] to relieve inflammation or watching out
[201.76 - 204.92] for it because there's some mistakes
[203.16 - 206.52] with inflammation and I'm going to I'm
[204.92 - 210.12] going to let you know what's going on
[206.52 - 212.04] with it it's it's it's a word we throw
[210.12 - 214.20] around so liberally we just throw it
[212.04 - 215.48] around we you know a lot of
[214.20 - 217.88] practitioners throw it away well you're
[215.48 - 219.96] inflamed well it's got to be some kind
[217.88 - 222.28] of inflammation well you know there must
[219.96 - 225.28] be some inflammation there you know
[222.28 - 227.72] maybe hey look it looks like you're
[225.28 - 229.80] inflamed you know whatever the MRI might
[227.72 - 232.64] show hey you have some inflammation in
[229.80 - 236.60] here wherever we use the word it hurts
[232.64 - 238.48] there's pain so well you're inflamed you
[236.60 - 240.84] know there's some pain there so yeah
[238.48 - 242.40] there's there's it's probably some kind
[240.84 - 244.68] of
[242.40 - 247.48] inflammation and so that's a word we
[244.68 - 250.72] kind of throw around but it's a lazy
[247.48 - 253.28] term hey I've used it I even use it I
[250.72 - 257.00] mean you know I I I'll use it it's a
[253.28 - 258.92] lazy term it really is and I'm going to
[257.00 - 260.76] tell you why it's a lazy term and and
[258.92 - 264.04] what's going on with that I mean you're
[260.76 - 267.08] probably figuring that out right now um
[264.04 - 270.28] but so it's it's not it's okay to use it
[267.08 - 272.88] because we want to relieve inflammation
[270.28 - 275.64] we want to be looking out for it we do
[272.88 - 278.52] we want to we want to look out for it
[275.64 - 280.16] and we want to try to fix it and we want
[278.52 - 282.24] to care about that we do want to care
[280.16 - 286.56] about that come on we want to try to fix
[282.24 - 289.60] inflammation we know that but we do use
[286.56 - 291.40] it as a lazy term because I'll tell you
[289.60 - 293.84] why we use it as a lazy term and I'll
[291.40 - 297.64] tell you why it's not good I'll tell you
[293.84 - 300.28] why it's not good to use it like we do
[297.64 - 304.00] because inflammation
[300.28 - 307.84] is not something that's a lone wolf it's
[304.00 - 310.68] not something that appears on its own
[307.84 - 314.24] okay it's not something that just
[310.68 - 316.16] evolves and appears like magically just
[314.24 - 318.84] you know or
[316.16 - 320.76] curse I mean a curse whatever right I
[318.84 - 325.00] mean it's not it's not something that
[320.76 - 326.44] just develops it's not a lone wolf okay
[325.00 - 328.88] I'm trying to paint the picture here I'm
[326.44 - 332.32] trying to paint the picture here for you
[328.88 - 336.64] instead it's it's a sign okay it's a
[332.32 - 338.16] sign but there's there's a problem here
[336.64 - 342.40] okay there's a problem think about this
[338.16 - 343.64] for a second okay here's the problem you
[342.40 - 347.20] know
[343.64 - 350.96] inflammation is not an answer it's not
[347.20 - 354.96] an answer I'm just telling you right now
[350.96 - 358.24] it's not the answer it's not a answer so
[354.96 - 360.68] my back hurts you know it's inflamed oh
[358.24 - 361.68] that's the answer okay that's it no it's
[360.68 - 365.20] not the
[361.68 - 367.44] answer it's not it's my knee my knee
[365.20 - 369.36] hurts it's been inflamed for a while
[367.44 - 372.52] it's I don't know what's going on with
[369.36 - 374.16] it my knee's inflamed um you know or no
[372.52 - 376.12] my knee hurts sorry about that my knee
[374.16 - 378.44] hurts you go to a practition or my knee
[376.12 - 380.48] hurts it's inflamed oh it's inflamed
[378.44 - 382.80] that's all okay it's inflamed no that's
[380.48 - 386.04] not it yeah yeah of course there's
[382.80 - 388.44] inflammation there but that's not it am
[386.04 - 391.04] I being a little too silly today is that
[388.44 - 392.56] what's happening so listen it you know
[391.04 - 396.60] that's not the
[392.56 - 399.68] answer right right so you know that's
[396.60 - 401.12] the whole point oh you know my gut I
[399.68 - 404.76] don't know what's going in my gut
[401.12 - 407.76] there's something going on there um you
[404.76 - 410.08] go to a practitioner well you know
[407.76 - 412.12] there's inflammation in there oh okay
[410.08 - 415.68] that's what it is I'm inflamed all right
[412.12 - 419.88] okay no that's not what it is it's not
[415.68 - 423.28] the answer so inflammation as answer is
[419.88 - 424.92] equals wrong which equals big mistake
[423.28 - 426.44] actually it's one of the great mistakes
[424.92 - 427.96] one of the great mistakes you know I
[426.44 - 431.48] talk about great mistakes it's important
[427.96 - 433.88] to really just know those but you know
[431.48 - 435.08] and I go into great detail great detail
[433.88 - 436.92] about inflammation that I'm not even
[435.08 - 440.12] going to cover today I go in great
[436.92 - 441.36] detail in uh the thyroid healing book
[440.12 - 443.52] that I can't even there's no way to
[441.36 - 445.28] cover all that that thing's so packed I
[443.52 - 449.48] can't even I can't even go there in a
[445.28 - 452.16] show but but the bottom line is is that
[449.48 - 456.52] you know it's not the answer it's not
[452.16 - 458.60] aone wolf it's mysterious it's
[456.52 - 460.76] mysterious and to the medical community
[458.60 - 463.16] is alternative conventional it is a lone
[460.76 - 465.84] wolf it is and it's a mysterious Lone
[463.16 - 467.56] Wolf but it's not it's not
[465.84 - 468.96] mysterious there's there's something
[467.56 - 472.36] behind the mystery there's answers
[468.96 - 474.88] behind the mystery there's there's
[472.36 - 476.68] reasons see
[474.88 - 481.00] inflammation
[476.68 - 483.68] occurs from two things two things just
[481.00 - 487.16] two can you believe it we have the human
[483.68 - 490.72] body we have the human body your body
[487.16 - 493.56] right our bodies right we have that and
[490.72 - 495.80] look what's going on millions and
[493.56 - 497.52] millions and millions and hundreds of
[495.80 - 500.84] millions of
[497.52 - 503.08] functions thousands and thousands and
[500.84 - 507.64] thousands of chemical
[503.08 - 510.28] functions per cubic inch of the physical
[507.64 - 514.52] human body scien research hasn't tapped
[510.28 - 518.52] into any of them okay and and all that
[514.52 - 521.68] going on all that mystery all that
[518.52 - 524.80] mystery I mean my brain Burns to the
[521.68 - 527.92] ground when I start going into a asking
[524.80 - 530.60] question war with Spirit when I start
[527.92 - 532.52] doing that when I start saying you know
[530.60 - 535.32] if I'm saying if I'm if I'm feeling kind
[532.52 - 537.56] of fresh if I'm feeling kind of fresh
[535.32 - 539.68] and I want to torture myself and I'm up
[537.56 - 543.12] for torturing myself and torturing my
[539.68 - 544.72] brain and and exploding it I'll just go
[543.12 - 546.52] you know I used to do it a lot more with
[544.72 - 548.84] Spirit but right now I just do it for
[546.52 - 551.44] the books I do it for the books I try to
[548.84 - 553.48] I try to you know I try to pull as much
[551.44 - 555.64] truth as I can out of spirits much
[553.48 - 557.24] unbelievable information that's
[555.64 - 559.24] incredible for our healing to move us
[557.24 - 561.32] forward on this planet advaned
[559.24 - 564.96] information and I and to for the books
[561.32 - 567.08] and I I I burn my brain out just just
[564.96 - 569.68] asking Spirit of zillion questions and
[567.08 - 571.72] getting and then you know and going on a
[569.68 - 573.80] spirit's on a tangent with information
[571.72 - 576.56] that's just too much for me and you know
[573.80 - 579.88] what happens is and you know when I'm
[576.56 - 581.80] doing that when I'm doing that spirit
[579.88 - 583.60] will be like well this organ has this
[581.80 - 585.04] many chemical functions and these are
[583.60 - 586.84] some of the chemical functions and it's
[585.04 - 588.40] like too much it's like oh my God I
[586.84 - 590.40] can't even believe that that that that
[588.40 - 593.36] will be in that will be in textbooks
[590.40 - 595.52] down the road hopefully if science gets
[593.36 - 598.60] there 500 years from now but the point
[595.52 - 600.48] is the amount the body is doing the
[598.60 - 603.84] amount the the body is
[600.48 - 606.84] doing is is so vast and what's happening
[603.84 - 610.52] but guess what there's only two
[606.84 - 614.24] things two groups of of
[610.52 - 616.52] things that cause inflammation can you
[614.24 - 619.20] believe that right that's simplistic
[616.52 - 621.44] spirit said to me there's two things I
[619.20 - 624.28] said there can't be two things because
[621.44 - 627.08] I've talked to you uh uh thousands of
[624.28 - 629.28] times spirit in my life and you you the
[627.08 - 632.72] the human body is way too complex when
[629.28 - 633.80] we even go to the brain you know with
[632.72 - 635.24] what's happening with the different
[633.80 - 637.72] varieties of heavy metals and how they
[635.24 - 639.92] group and how they create Al Alo and how
[637.72 - 641.28] they interact with each other with radio
[639.92 - 643.08] signals and all kinds of stuff things
[641.28 - 645.08] that nobody knows about nobody knows in
[643.08 - 648.36] the health field Spirit tells me about
[645.08 - 650.84] and how can there be just two things for
[648.36 - 653.44] inflammation and spirit said there is
[650.84 - 656.64] there's injury I was like oh okay so you
[653.44 - 659.20] mean you bang yourself or car crash or
[656.64 - 662.72] you know you hit your elbow the other
[659.20 - 664.80] day boy my knee my knee hit the corner
[662.72 - 667.12] of a chair the other day I got to tell
[664.80 - 668.88] you guys that was that Lit it right up I
[667.12 - 670.60] was just like wow that was I was I was
[668.88 - 672.32] really walking quick I had a piece of
[670.60 - 675.20] paper in my hand I was walking quick I
[672.32 - 680.24] was trying to get around to the office
[675.20 - 682.72] and banged my knee on a real you know
[680.24 - 686.92] uneasy chair sticking out so hey here's
[682.72 - 689.20] the deal so injury is one so you
[686.92 - 691.84] everybody's had some form an injury
[689.20 - 695.60] right no matter what it is Sports Injury
[691.84 - 698.28] exercise injury um you anything anything
[695.60 - 701.24] you could be walking along and twist
[698.28 - 704.32] your ankle could be walking along I've
[701.24 - 705.72] done that I've done that remember years
[704.32 - 708.00] ago I was just
[705.72 - 709.56] walking um and and you know wasn't
[708.00 - 711.40] thinking I was just you know was just
[709.56 - 714.88] listening to Spirit was totally into
[711.40 - 717.52] What Spirit was saying you know I was I
[714.88 - 719.32] I walked off of a curb kind of twisted
[717.52 - 721.56] my ankle a little bit was like geez PE
[719.32 - 723.92] you know you can and I've seen people
[721.56 - 725.72] really who have come to me that have
[723.92 - 729.12] they've Fallen you know really hard you
[725.72 - 731.20] can injure yourself ice forget it ice
[729.12 - 733.92] that's a whole another game every winter
[731.20 - 737.00] I hear it all the time every single
[733.92 - 740.12] winter people like just break
[737.00 - 742.32] their break their butts and you know
[740.12 - 744.60] here's the deal that's that's one way to
[742.32 - 746.12] get inflamed and the other one is
[744.60 - 748.48] there's only other there's only one
[746.12 - 751.08] other only one other and you're going to
[748.48 - 754.12] say how can that be this is this is
[751.08 - 757.20] what's really cool here how can that be
[754.12 - 759.20] where it's just one other when you know
[757.20 - 761.76] there's this other practitioner or
[759.20 - 764.00] doctor or expert says that you know this
[761.76 - 766.00] food can inflame you and this food can
[764.00 - 767.56] inflame you and this causes this and
[766.00 - 771.40] this causes this and we're going to air
[767.56 - 773.96] that out no there's one other thing and
[771.40 - 776.52] it's an Invader it's an
[773.96 - 780.12] Invader an
[776.52 - 784.36] Invader okay that's the other
[780.12 - 789.08] inflammatory maker too that's it human
[784.36 - 791.36] body is so so darn complex with so many
[789.08 - 795.08] chemical functions and so much going on
[791.36 - 798.04] it is utterly utterly insane and you
[795.08 - 801.96] know two things for
[798.04 - 804.16] inflammation okay injury sure you can
[801.96 - 808.12] injure yourself in hundreds of different
[804.16 - 810.52] ways but injury or Invader and there's
[808.12 - 812.00] hundreds of different different Invaders
[810.52 - 815.44] that's right hundreds of different
[812.00 - 817.76] Invaders but it's two things so so
[815.44 - 820.00] here's the deal though you know you tell
[817.76 - 821.72] somebody else that you know you tell say
[820.00 - 823.12] uh you know you tell a hip doctor that
[821.72 - 825.64] that's you know totally in alternative
[823.12 - 827.64] medicine conventional mix and they're
[825.64 - 829.20] doing great things totally respected
[827.64 - 831.20] absolutely I know a whole bunch of
[829.20 - 833.24] amazing people in the industry and
[831.20 - 835.44] people I don't even know and they'll say
[833.24 - 838.56] no no you know wheat wheat causes
[835.44 - 842.00] inflammation that inflames you um you
[838.56 - 846.24] know certain foods uh can inflame
[842.00 - 850.28] people no no not at
[846.24 - 853.24] all see wheat gluten gluten itself
[850.28 - 855.40] doesn't inflame you what gluten does it
[853.24 - 858.00] feeds something it feeds something that
[855.40 - 860.56] inflames you it feeds an Invader and
[858.00 - 862.56] that is not out there now and what
[860.56 - 864.32] little is is because I've I've killed
[862.56 - 866.04] myself to try to get that out there in
[864.32 - 869.92] every way
[866.04 - 872.96] possible and that's how it
[869.92 - 876.44] works it's important to know I mean I
[872.96 - 878.52] know people in their 80s I mean the crap
[876.44 - 880.48] they eat I can't I mean I can't even
[878.52 - 884.08] tell you maybe you know somebody I mean
[880.48 - 887.48] they're eating pound cake for God's
[884.08 - 890.04] sake or whatever they're eating you know
[887.48 - 892.84] cupcakes I'm not talking about like a
[890.04 - 895.08] brand muffin which still is loaded with
[892.84 - 897.68] God knows what in in so many cases
[895.08 - 901.24] talking about cupcakes you know
[897.68 - 903.48] cupcakes right with fondant on top or
[901.24 - 907.04] whatever you call that
[903.48 - 909.20] stuff you know and and I mean they're
[907.04 - 911.92] fine they're not even in I look at them
[909.20 - 914.64] I can't find inflammation in them I
[911.92 - 918.96] can't find inflammation unless they
[914.64 - 921.36] twist their hip or something they're 85
[918.96 - 923.44] and they bang their you know back
[921.36 - 925.88] against something they fall they you
[923.44 - 928.32] know then I see the inflammation but
[925.88 - 932.96] I've had you know people at 80 years old
[928.32 - 934.44] people at at 70 years old people at 90
[932.96 - 938.32] over the years I'm not talking about a
[934.44 - 940.00] lot of them but they've had them and I
[938.32 - 941.96] mean they're eating chocolate cake I'm
[940.00 - 944.20] talking like just horrible chocolate
[941.96 - 946.64] cake you you know in a
[944.20 - 949.48] restaurant not talking about some kind
[946.64 - 951.76] of holistic restaurant or health food
[949.48 - 954.00] store that's got a somewhat of a healthy
[951.76 - 957.40] chocolate cake that's still got coconut
[954.00 - 959.64] o not coconut you know canola oil in it
[957.40 - 962.16] and still got you know natural flavoring
[959.64 - 965.20] and and and the icing or whatever it is
[962.16 - 967.36] that's that's bad the point is is that
[965.20 - 970.00] talking about the real bad stuff just
[967.36 - 974.24] lar just Pig lard
[970.00 - 977.80] and just and God knows what okay
[974.24 - 979.92] chemicals and everything right I'm sure
[977.80 - 981.48] you guys have you know tried your fair
[979.92 - 983.56] share over the years of some something
[981.48 - 985.76] like that but the point is the
[983.56 - 988.88] inflammation is not off the chart is
[985.76 - 991.16] very little very little existing and
[988.88 - 992.72] some people have seen and it's like you
[991.16 - 994.36] just shake your head you shake your head
[992.72 - 997.36] and you say to Spirit well what the hell
[994.36 - 998.84] is going on here and spirit says well
[997.36 - 1001.12] that they're missing something I said
[998.84 - 1004.60] what are they missing they're missing an
[1001.12 - 1008.96] Invader or they're missing an
[1004.60 - 1011.24] Invader that is doing something that's
[1008.96 - 1013.12] you know you know real dormant Invader
[1011.24 - 1015.28] hasn't even come out it's just not even
[1013.12 - 1019.32] coming out to play so it won't even
[1015.28 - 1021.96] create inflammation it's so dormant
[1019.32 - 1023.76] or they're missing an Invader completely
[1021.96 - 1026.28] I've run across a couple of people what
[1023.76 - 1028.32] am I talking about Invader talking about
[1026.28 - 1029.80] pathogen pathogen I like the word
[1028.32 - 1032.60] Invader now because when I say pathogen
[1029.80 - 1034.60] people are like what what's that
[1032.60 - 1036.56] pathogen you know I run across that a
[1034.60 - 1039.00] lot well I could totally get it pathogen
[1036.56 - 1042.84] is just a weird I don't know like who
[1039.00 - 1044.08] knows what a pathogen is it it's crazy I
[1042.84 - 1045.44] was even talking to a friend I haven't
[1044.08 - 1047.16] talked to years I was like yeah well you
[1045.44 - 1048.92] know I think you know I think what
[1047.16 - 1050.64] you're dealing with I said is a pathogen
[1048.92 - 1052.48] because be showing me this right here
[1050.64 - 1055.52] and they said what's a
[1052.48 - 1058.80] pathogen I said an
[1055.52 - 1060.60] Invader and he said an Invader what do
[1058.80 - 1064.24] you mean and
[1060.60 - 1065.64] he here's here's here's the deal so
[1064.24 - 1067.40] could you to run across people that
[1065.64 - 1069.96] don't have it they could eat all the
[1067.40 - 1073.88] gluten they want they could eat bread
[1069.96 - 1075.72] they could have sourdough whatever right
[1073.88 - 1078.56] and and and they could have
[1075.72 - 1081.36] baguettes with fet of cheese on it like
[1078.56 - 1083.84] lots of feta cheese on a bag baguette
[1081.36 - 1085.76] they can have a brisca with mozzarella
[1083.84 - 1089.32] cheese on wheat
[1085.76 - 1092.32] bread okay so they can you can keep on
[1089.32 - 1094.48] going on they get a fish sticks and
[1092.32 - 1098.48] batter fish sticks they can eat fish
[1094.48 - 1101.12] sticks all day long fish sticks with
[1098.48 - 1103.16] Mercury fish sticks with Mercury and and
[1101.12 - 1106.92] and some kind of you know really low
[1103.16 - 1109.40] grade egg wheat batter corn wheat egg
[1106.92 - 1110.64] batter on it fish stick
[1109.40 - 1114.68] I don't know if you guys have ever had a
[1110.64 - 1117.00] fish stick um know chicken fingers in
[1114.68 - 1118.40] some you know terrible restaurant
[1117.00 - 1120.96] terrible restaurant or fast food
[1118.40 - 1123.24] restaurant chicken
[1120.96 - 1125.16] fingers the point is is they could eat
[1123.24 - 1126.52] this stuff yeah sure sure sure there's
[1125.16 - 1128.40] other things in that food that could
[1126.52 - 1130.32] eventually tip something off like create
[1128.40 - 1133.72] the worst
[1130.32 - 1136.64] worst kidney stone ever the worst gall
[1133.72 - 1138.52] stone ever yeah and I see that in these
[1136.64 - 1140.48] people say sure I'll see an 80-year-old
[1138.52 - 1142.80] that has a whole pile of
[1140.48 - 1145.40] stones he Stones
[1142.80 - 1147.04] everywhere all right because they've
[1145.40 - 1148.64] been eating that that chocolate cake
[1147.04 - 1150.40] they've been eating those cupcakes with
[1148.64 - 1152.32] that crazy fondant on there they've been
[1150.40 - 1154.28] eating whatever and you know and they
[1152.32 - 1157.84] got those big big stones and sure maybe
[1154.28 - 1160.12] that stone hasn't aggravated that that
[1157.84 - 1162.40] gallbladder by trying to get stuck in
[1160.12 - 1163.80] the duct remember that's an injury
[1162.40 - 1166.36] that's an
[1163.80 - 1167.84] injury the gall stone gets just stuck in
[1166.36 - 1168.76] that gallbladder there and it's jammed
[1167.84 - 1171.92] in the duck
[1168.76 - 1174.64] that's an injury that's not an Invader
[1171.92 - 1176.64] so then inflammation starts that's an
[1174.64 - 1179.32] injury that's an internal
[1176.64 - 1182.56] injury okay that's an internal
[1179.32 - 1185.24] injury you see
[1182.56 - 1187.64] and my annoying today or what with this
[1185.24 - 1189.36] inflammation thing it's just it's it's
[1187.64 - 1190.88] fun to talk about inflammation but it's
[1189.36 - 1193.36] not fun to have it I'm going to tell you
[1190.88 - 1194.52] right now I've seen people so inflamed
[1193.36 - 1197.04] it's
[1194.52 - 1200.04] heartbreaking and and it and and it can
[1197.04 - 1202.44] it can injure the soul it hurts so much
[1200.04 - 1203.68] it hurts I've be seeing people suffer
[1202.44 - 1206.52] and we're going to go into some
[1203.68 - 1209.56] different kinds of inflammation so you
[1206.52 - 1213.12] you get you kind of get what is going
[1209.56 - 1214.64] on so when it comes down it's it's this
[1213.12 - 1216.20] catch all we throw around it's just
[1214.64 - 1218.76] catch all word we throw around now in
[1216.20 - 1221.80] the industry we just throw it around but
[1218.76 - 1224.84] it's not the answer so important to know
[1221.80 - 1226.68] what's going on so if you got something
[1224.84 - 1228.76] like a knee surgery you had because your
[1226.68 - 1230.36] knee wore out
[1228.76 - 1232.44] and it wore out so you got a knee
[1230.36 - 1234.52] replacement but you're not
[1232.44 - 1236.20] recovering and the doctor doesn't know
[1234.52 - 1238.20] why and they're thinking about going in
[1236.20 - 1239.84] there again and doing some work the
[1238.20 - 1241.88] surgeon is thinking about going in there
[1239.84 - 1244.68] again and doing some work and it's just
[1241.88 - 1247.20] not calming down nothing's
[1244.68 - 1248.60] happening that's because something else
[1247.20 - 1251.04] is happening in the body and then you
[1248.60 - 1253.68] get somebody else meaning like meaning
[1251.04 - 1255.56] somebody else might just get a you need
[1253.68 - 1257.12] replacement they're perfectly fine
[1255.56 - 1259.00] nothing going on they're walking in 3
[1257.12 - 1260.56] days and healing really quick the other
[1259.00 - 1262.80] person has 6 months of recovery and it's
[1260.56 - 1267.32] swelling all the time that's from
[1262.80 - 1269.52] having an Invader in the body too so the
[1267.32 - 1271.24] Invader was most likely there putting
[1269.52 - 1272.88] inflammation that was chronic on the
[1271.24 - 1275.08] joint to begin with on the knee joint to
[1272.88 - 1277.20] begin with which then led to the the
[1275.08 - 1278.92] knee to wear out cartilage bone on bone
[1277.20 - 1281.84] metal on metal we call it like the brake
[1278.92 - 1283.96] system on a car and then knee
[1281.84 - 1285.00] replacement occurred but no one fixed
[1283.96 - 1287.20] the
[1285.00 - 1289.20] pathogen The Invader that was in the
[1287.20 - 1290.64] body which is normally Epstein bar when
[1289.20 - 1291.88] that happens with knee Replacements and
[1290.64 - 1294.96] hip replacements and people don't
[1291.88 - 1297.84] recover quick enough and it takes time
[1294.96 - 1301.20] and but that's what I mean that's how it
[1297.84 - 1302.68] works giving you kind of a kind of a you
[1301.20 - 1306.32] know quick rundown of different ways
[1302.68 - 1308.64] that's happening so inflammation alone
[1306.32 - 1310.56] is a great mistake but the mistake is
[1308.64 - 1312.68] not trying to fix inflammation even
[1310.56 - 1314.92] though mistakes are made trying to fix
[1312.68 - 1317.36] inflammation all the time the mistake
[1314.92 - 1319.08] isn't made relieving it even though
[1317.36 - 1321.08] sometimes mistakes made relieving it but
[1319.08 - 1323.08] no it's still we're watching out for it
[1321.08 - 1326.56] the mistake is using it as an
[1323.08 - 1329.92] answer it's a lazy lazy
[1326.56 - 1332.08] term but I'm trying to you know give you
[1329.92 - 1334.16] truth trying to give you truth truth
[1332.08 - 1336.60] that's not tampered with truth that's
[1334.16 - 1337.84] clean I have to say that a lot now you
[1336.60 - 1339.00] someone said to me the other day are you
[1337.84 - 1340.20] really going to say this at the
[1339.00 - 1343.04] beginning of your
[1340.20 - 1344.56] shows about the clean information versus
[1343.04 - 1345.92] you know inflammation that's been you
[1344.56 - 1347.52] know with strings attached and all this
[1345.92 - 1349.28] other all this other crap and all this
[1347.52 - 1351.76] stuff are you really going to say this I
[1349.28 - 1353.88] go yeah because people don't realize it
[1351.76 - 1355.84] people I had somebody actually say
[1353.88 - 1357.32] something to me a while back and say oh
[1355.84 - 1358.56] oh your information you're in your show
[1357.32 - 1360.24] I mean you're probably just picking it
[1358.56 - 1362.28] up from everybody else there's more
[1360.24 - 1365.24] advanced in no it's not true that's not
[1362.28 - 1367.48] true that's not true that stuff's
[1365.24 - 1369.12] contaminated most of it is anyway
[1367.48 - 1371.08] because of because of funding funding
[1369.12 - 1372.76] has to go into it when funding goes into
[1371.08 - 1373.92] it the outcome has to turn out a certain
[1372.76 - 1375.36] way or you going to pissed off your
[1373.92 - 1377.32] investors and that's how health
[1375.36 - 1378.72] information is created both alternative
[1377.32 - 1380.64] alternatively
[1378.72 - 1382.40] conventionally um and and chronic
[1380.64 - 1385.76] illness especially chronic illness
[1382.40 - 1388.12] especially that's what I mean and so
[1385.76 - 1390.32] let's talk about these Foods so you talk
[1388.12 - 1393.08] to somebody and they're like no no there
[1390.32 - 1396.44] there's foods that can inflame you no
[1393.08 - 1399.60] there's foods that will feed a pathogen
[1396.44 - 1402.08] to cause more
[1399.60 - 1404.96] inflammation that's what's going
[1402.08 - 1406.64] on like for you know Celiac and the gut
[1404.96 - 1409.48] or anything there's different kinds of
[1406.64 - 1412.48] inflammation in different places
[1409.48 - 1414.36] and you know let's cover some of it all
[1412.48 - 1416.52] right you you're with me on this you got
[1414.36 - 1418.68] hey did you fasten your seat belts got
[1416.52 - 1421.64] to say it again terrible I got to always
[1418.68 - 1423.04] say it I know did you your seat belts
[1421.64 - 1425.24] there's different kinds of inflammation
[1423.04 - 1427.36] you ready brain
[1425.24 - 1429.72] inflammation brain
[1427.36 - 1432.12] inflammation it's easy to get different
[1429.72 - 1434.88] kinds of brain inflammation and nerves
[1432.12 - 1436.60] in the brain that go to the brain and
[1434.88 - 1439.28] run down through the body those nerves
[1436.60 - 1443.20] can get inflammation neural neurological
[1439.28 - 1445.92] inflammation that's nerve
[1443.20 - 1448.20] inflammation different nerves can be
[1445.92 - 1451.88] inflamed from
[1448.20 - 1454.28] pathogens pathogens heavy metals
[1451.88 - 1458.48] technically don't inflame something they
[1454.28 - 1461.76] feed a pathogen or Invader to inflame
[1458.48 - 1464.40] something because heavy metals is a food
[1461.76 - 1466.52] had another practitioner a long time ago
[1464.40 - 1467.92] um because I'll never forget this I
[1466.52 - 1470.08] think it was about I don't know a year
[1467.92 - 1471.64] ago or something over a year ago so it's
[1470.08 - 1473.08] quite a while back and this practitioner
[1471.64 - 1475.44] said to me you know heavy metals cause
[1473.08 - 1478.92] inflammation I go no heavy metals feed
[1475.44 - 1482.40] they have to feed something to cause
[1478.92 - 1486.04] inflammation they're like I just it it's
[1482.40 - 1489.32] it's this is important information from
[1486.04 - 1491.08] Spirit that we have to know I I you know
[1489.32 - 1492.72] having everybody in the dark too long
[1491.08 - 1495.16] it's just it's getting too painful I'm
[1492.72 - 1497.00] getting older it was cute and fuzzy and
[1495.16 - 1498.80] fun when I was younger and thought I'd
[1497.00 - 1501.08] live forever
[1498.80 - 1502.72] okay I thought I'd live to be 500 years
[1501.08 - 1505.04] old because when you're younger you just
[1502.72 - 1507.12] you just feel indestructible even though
[1505.04 - 1509.60] Spirit made it clear to me I wasn't as
[1507.12 - 1511.72] much as possible but the point is the
[1509.60 - 1512.92] point is is when you're younger you you
[1511.72 - 1514.28] think you got all the Time in the World
[1512.92 - 1515.60] is what I'm trying to say to get this
[1514.28 - 1517.56] information out I remember telling
[1515.60 - 1520.08] spirit I remember saying yeah yeah yeah
[1517.56 - 1521.72] there's plenty of time for that we'll
[1520.08 - 1526.00] let the information out and spirit's
[1521.72 - 1528.76] like no you you don't you don't get
[1526.00 - 1531.60] it you got your life time to get it out
[1528.76 - 1534.72] but it's it's there it's it's going
[1531.60 - 1536.44] backwards out there you have to try you
[1534.72 - 1540.20] can't just click on the
[1536.44 - 1542.92] TV and sit inside your living room and
[1540.20 - 1545.52] expect this information from me being
[1542.92 - 1547.84] Spirit to get out there and change the
[1545.52 - 1550.24] course change the course of time to
[1547.84 - 1551.72] change the course of Health change the
[1550.24 - 1554.80] course of what's going
[1551.72 - 1558.12] on I'm like no there's no rush I'll just
[1554.80 - 1561.60] watch this old episode of some sitcom
[1558.12 - 1564.16] there's no rush you know being a kid but
[1561.60 - 1567.36] there but but it matters it matters and
[1564.16 - 1571.72] I'm and I'm I'm I'm on the train of
[1567.36 - 1574.64] rushing it so brain inflammation gut
[1571.72 - 1577.32] inflammation gut small intestinal tract
[1574.64 - 1578.88] inflammation you know like sibo for
[1577.32 - 1582.68] instance trepac cacus we covered that in
[1578.88 - 1584.96] the sibo show right colon information
[1582.68 - 1586.32] such as like the shingles virus that's
[1584.96 - 1588.80] causing
[1586.32 - 1590.96] colitis or even a basic you know
[1588.80 - 1592.80] irritable bow you know strep causing
[1590.96 - 1595.44] irritable vow strep is a real big
[1592.80 - 1599.84] irritable vow IBS
[1595.44 - 1602.36] deal you know pathogens pathogens and if
[1599.84 - 1604.20] you're a big parasite believer real big
[1602.36 - 1606.56] parasite believer just know that these
[1604.20 - 1609.76] are the the very things that show off
[1606.56 - 1612.24] shell casings and show off um all the
[1609.76 - 1614.16] different broken uh viral bodies and
[1612.24 - 1616.12] showcasing that science doesn't have the
[1614.16 - 1618.08] tag on so when it comes out to a stool
[1616.12 - 1619.76] sample you're alternative practition say
[1618.08 - 1621.56] you got parasites I don't care what name
[1619.76 - 1623.40] you use you want to use parasites you
[1621.56 - 1625.52] use the word parasites are there
[1623.40 - 1627.76] parasites yes there's parasites but
[1625.52 - 1629.72] parasites let's talk about parasites for
[1627.76 - 1631.28] a second going to have to do a show on
[1629.72 - 1634.28] actually you know what I'll do a whole
[1631.28 - 1636.08] show on parasites because that because
[1634.28 - 1638.28] it's going to get everybody angry
[1636.08 - 1640.72] because the belief system around
[1638.28 - 1642.84] parasites is so tightly woven right now
[1640.72 - 1644.56] that I'm afraid to even touch it because
[1642.84 - 1646.56] I'm just going to get just get people
[1644.56 - 1648.76] are going to want to punch my lights out
[1646.56 - 1651.20] so I have to make sure it's explained
[1648.76 - 1652.60] with all the details from Spirit so it
[1651.20 - 1654.72] can be easily
[1652.60 - 1656.92] understood instead of just saying a one
[1654.72 - 1659.16] blank statement you know don't get lost
[1656.92 - 1660.68] in the parasitical thing because there's
[1659.16 - 1661.76] a lot of problems going on with that
[1660.68 - 1663.20] that I got to explained and then
[1661.76 - 1665.12] somebody getting really mad so we're
[1663.20 - 1667.64] going to do a whole show on that there
[1665.12 - 1669.08] are parasites okay for anybody who's all
[1667.64 - 1671.24] of a sudden starting to freak out right
[1669.08 - 1673.08] now there are parasites okay so don't
[1671.24 - 1676.32] don't don't worry okay I'm just going to
[1673.08 - 1678.40] explain really what's happening and uh
[1676.32 - 1681.56] hopefully by the end of that show you're
[1678.40 - 1684.92] you're not angry as a Bee
[1681.56 - 1687.68] um it's all about it's you know it's all
[1684.92 - 1689.64] about you know you know getting the
[1687.68 - 1692.20] information out and and trying to get it
[1689.64 - 1695.08] out in a way that that obviously works
[1692.20 - 1698.48] for all of us here's the deal here's the
[1695.08 - 1700.48] deal um with with like the gut
[1698.48 - 1703.36] inflammation we have all these different
[1700.48 - 1705.92] pathogens that get inside the gut and
[1703.36 - 1708.48] cause an inflammation in the gut I mean
[1705.92 - 1710.84] you got se you got you got a whole bunch
[1708.48 - 1712.56] of different bacteria bacteria is really
[1710.84 - 1714.04] a leading thing that sits inside the
[1712.56 - 1716.16] colon in the gut and everything and then
[1714.04 - 1718.64] you got the viruses you know all
[1716.16 - 1720.20] different kinds cytoma virus you got all
[1718.64 - 1721.60] the different herpetic viruses you got
[1720.20 - 1723.04] all the shingle viruses you got the
[1721.60 - 1725.44] Epstein bar varieties you got all the
[1723.04 - 1728.48] mutated hhv 6es and everything else you
[1725.44 - 1730.56] got them all undiscovered hhv 10 11 12
[1728.48 - 1733.36] the whole name it all Gets In The Cut
[1730.56 - 1735.96] causes trouble so then when you eat some
[1733.36 - 1738.04] wheat or you know whatever wheat gluten
[1735.96 - 1739.56] and you eat it goes down the a pike and
[1738.04 - 1741.76] it finally gets there there's a Feeding
[1739.56 - 1743.68] Frenzy and now you're like oh my God I'm
[1741.76 - 1745.40] constipated I'm feeling a belly ache I'm
[1743.68 - 1748.36] feeling you know I'm wheat intolerant
[1745.40 - 1750.28] I'm gluten intolerant um you know I got
[1748.36 - 1752.52] Celiac the doctor says I have Celiac
[1750.28 - 1756.56] Celiac is just an it's just it's not a
[1752.52 - 1757.52] genetic not a genetic disease or illness
[1756.56 - 1759.44] it's an
[1757.52 - 1762.68] inflammatory illness it's an
[1759.44 - 1765.72] inflammatory illness because pathogens
[1762.68 - 1768.40] so um so so then next thing you know you
[1765.72 - 1771.16] know Celiac you got that going on
[1768.40 - 1773.40] and um and this is this is due to all
[1771.16 - 1777.00] that kind kind of stuff in the gut organ
[1773.40 - 1779.40] inflammation organ dense organs so forth
[1777.00 - 1782.08] you know not just Hollow inflammation in
[1779.40 - 1784.40] the organs any organ really liver can be
[1782.08 - 1786.44] inflamed how does the liver get
[1784.40 - 1788.40] inflamed how why would a liver get
[1786.44 - 1790.76] inflamed every you know you wouldn't
[1788.40 - 1793.04] believe how many livers are inflamed I
[1790.76 - 1795.08] can't even I I hate going out I hate
[1793.04 - 1797.60] going out I hate leaving the
[1795.08 - 1799.24] office okay and I hate having to go
[1797.60 - 1801.88] somewhere I hate having to have my
[1799.24 - 1803.64] assistant drive me around in the car and
[1801.88 - 1805.36] go somewhere cuz I'm just going to be
[1803.64 - 1807.56] read I'm just going to be reading liver
[1805.36 - 1809.32] inflammation but what's under and what's
[1807.56 - 1811.64] causing the liver inflammation I mean
[1809.32 - 1813.16] literally drive you insane you're just
[1811.64 - 1815.60] spirit's just talking to you like just
[1813.16 - 1817.68] just literally talking to you there's no
[1815.60 - 1819.76] there's no shutting that off can't shut
[1817.68 - 1821.32] that off I can't be like oh I'll go on a
[1819.76 - 1823.52] cruise with my friend I'm a psychic
[1821.32 - 1825.80] medium medium or I'll go here and do
[1823.52 - 1828.80] this and no there's no shutting it off I
[1825.80 - 1830.60] can't do that I can't have the fun in
[1828.80 - 1833.56] between at
[1830.60 - 1835.56] all so you know be in the car and just
[1833.56 - 1837.20] literally at the stoplight that person's
[1835.56 - 1839.48] got a liver problem that person's got
[1837.20 - 1841.92] inflammation of the liver that person
[1839.48 - 1844.36] has inflammation of the liver you know
[1841.92 - 1846.48] you go into a restaurant I had to meet
[1844.36 - 1848.16] somebody in a restaurant and I'm in a
[1846.48 - 1851.04] restaurant and I'm like asking spirit is
[1848.16 - 1852.88] there food poisoning on this is this was
[1851.04 - 1854.64] there was was the chef playing around
[1852.88 - 1857.52] with raw chicken and then and then put
[1854.64 - 1860.40] my salad together I mean was you know or
[1857.52 - 1861.80] put my dish together was the million
[1860.40 - 1863.92] questions I have to ask Spirit while I'm
[1861.80 - 1865.60] in a restaurant to make sure that I
[1863.92 - 1868.00] don't get the worst food poisoning of a
[1865.60 - 1870.16] lifetime end up in the in the ER and
[1868.00 - 1871.76] intensive care seen people in intensive
[1870.16 - 1873.48] care because of food poisoning it breaks
[1871.76 - 1876.52] your heart over just stupid mistakes
[1873.48 - 1878.12] done in the kitchen and restaurants so
[1876.52 - 1881.20] you know it's all that but the liver I
[1878.12 - 1883.48] see I see people the liver problems is
[1881.20 - 1886.84] unbelievable
[1883.48 - 1891.08] unbelievable and um so the bottom line
[1886.84 - 1893.20] is what's inflaming the liver pathogens
[1891.08 - 1896.00] pathogens whether it triggers off liver
[1893.20 - 1898.04] en enzyme issues you know whatever Bly
[1896.00 - 1900.88] Rin issues whatever it's triggering
[1898.04 - 1902.40] off it you know whether the MRI and Cat
[1900.88 - 1903.80] Scan starts seeing damage and then tell
[1902.40 - 1905.44] somebody they have Hepatitis C by the
[1903.80 - 1908.68] way that's Epstein bar long-term damage
[1905.44 - 1910.96] in the liver causing hepatitis C ABD
[1908.68 - 1914.88] ABCD is all
[1910.96 - 1918.32] viral but but you might you might say
[1914.88 - 1920.60] well ABD ABC d got to learn my alphabet
[1918.32 - 1924.76] today you might say that that's you know
[1920.60 - 1924.76] hepatitis A B C and
[1924.88 - 1931.24] D tongue twister you might say that they
[1928.96 - 1932.84] already know that that's viral they
[1931.24 - 1934.52] don't know what virus it is did you know
[1932.84 - 1936.12] that medical research and science
[1934.52 - 1937.60] doesn't know what virus it is they just
[1936.12 - 1940.24] go by inflammatory
[1937.60 - 1942.24] markers they go by CAT scans MRIs and
[1940.24 - 1944.52] inflammation they don't know what kind
[1942.24 - 1947.56] of virus it
[1944.52 - 1949.72] is Hepatitis B they don't know what kind
[1947.56 - 1951.80] it's just a that's just a stage of
[1949.72 - 1954.56] inflammation they don't know what kind
[1951.80 - 1957.84] of bug it is I'm going to tell you right
[1954.56 - 1961.28] now hepatitis C no one knows what kind
[1957.84 - 1964.20] of bug that is hepatic liver inflamed
[1961.28 - 1966.08] liver viral they find you know what's
[1964.20 - 1968.56] amazing about research and science they
[1966.08 - 1971.12] actually know this is amazing I find
[1968.56 - 1972.76] this incredible they actually know you
[1971.12 - 1975.32] know and I used I shouldn't have said
[1972.76 - 1976.80] this years ago I think it was I think I
[1975.32 - 1978.44] was being challenged by a couple of
[1976.80 - 1981.80] doctor doctors they were really upset at
[1978.44 - 1983.40] me they were upset because I was I was
[1981.80 - 1984.64] you know had this information it was
[1983.40 - 1988.68] like and they were like and this is in
[1984.64 - 1990.60] the early days this is in the early days
[1988.68 - 1993.88] this was like 15 years
[1990.60 - 1996.84] ago and there's earlier days than that
[1993.88 - 1998.40] but what what was happening 15 years ago
[1996.84 - 1999.92] and a couple of doctors wanted to talk
[1998.40 - 2001.92] to me because they wanted to know how I
[1999.92 - 2004.08] figured out something and it was
[2001.92 - 2006.04] accurate I told them how I figured it
[2004.08 - 2007.72] out and how how it happened he said that
[2006.04 - 2010.00] just doesn't make sense hear your voice
[2007.72 - 2013.72] told you that this is what's going
[2010.00 - 2016.88] on and I said yeah yeah yeah hear it
[2013.72 - 2019.40] again here we go here we go here we go
[2016.88 - 2021.00] again I was I know was like probably 17
[2019.40 - 2024.00] or 18 years ago or
[2021.00 - 2025.76] something and and you know and and and
[2024.00 - 2028.92] they were like well no you couldn't have
[2025.76 - 2031.44] heard a voice to know this you couldn't
[2028.92 - 2033.92] have known that this liver was this bad
[2031.44 - 2037.04] off and had the scar tissue it had in
[2033.92 - 2040.28] the corner with a cyst in the corner ALS
[2037.04 - 2042.76] scarred up and hepatitis C at the same
[2040.28 - 2045.32] time there's no way you knew that
[2042.76 - 2047.20] without some kind of documentation tests
[2045.32 - 2049.28] and to confirm it some kind of blood
[2047.20 - 2054.00] work where did you get this information
[2049.28 - 2056.40] I said well I'm telling you where I got
[2054.00 - 2058.48] it and you know and then and they said
[2056.40 - 2061.24] and they said you know what I we were
[2058.48 - 2063.88] going to we were going to we we wanted
[2061.24 - 2066.36] to congratulate you on figuring this out
[2063.88 - 2068.12] as a colleague but because you said you
[2066.36 - 2070.12] heard it from The Source you heard it
[2068.12 - 2072.28] from which is Spirit we're not going to
[2070.12 - 2073.96] do that we're not going to we're not
[2072.28 - 2078.00] going to give you any we're not going to
[2073.96 - 2079.44] congratulate you I said you know what
[2078.00 - 2083.56] you know what I was going to
[2079.44 - 2085.72] congratulate you because what you stand
[2083.56 - 2087.84] behind the research and science that's
[2085.72 - 2090.60] given to you you actually know that
[2087.84 - 2092.64] hepatitis C is a virus you know you
[2090.60 - 2094.08] don't know what kind of virus it is but
[2092.64 - 2095.92] you know it's a virus and I was going to
[2094.08 - 2097.84] congratulate you guys for the fact that
[2095.92 - 2099.12] you even know it's virus
[2097.84 - 2101.36] but now I'm not even going to do that
[2099.12 - 2103.08] I'm not going to congratulate you either
[2101.36 - 2105.32] and they sat there they were baffled
[2103.08 - 2107.40] because because yeah because they didn't
[2105.32 - 2109.52] know what kind of virus it was but they
[2107.40 - 2111.60] knew it was viral and they were like oh
[2109.52 - 2113.32] yeah well okay and it's true because
[2111.60 - 2117.40] it's hard for research and Science and
[2113.32 - 2120.28] no and with the liver with hepatitis A B
[2117.40 - 2122.44] and C and D it's a hepatic inflamed
[2120.28 - 2125.04] liver they haven't singled out those
[2122.44 - 2128.16] viruses they're not singled out I don't
[2125.04 - 2130.72] care what anybody says because they have
[2128.16 - 2133.08] not singled out those bugs at the blood
[2130.72 - 2136.64] lab I'm telling you right now it's 17
[2133.08 - 2138.92] years later still hav figured it out and
[2136.64 - 2142.20] it's it's it's a herpetic
[2138.92 - 2145.52] virus it gets in the liver and causes
[2142.20 - 2148.44] different stages of what they deem
[2145.52 - 2151.12] hepatitis different stages of
[2148.44 - 2154.40] inflammation inflammation is not the
[2151.12 - 2158.00] answer what's behind the inflammation is
[2154.40 - 2161.28] the answer that's the great mistake
[2158.00 - 2164.24] Ste do you guys still with me you still
[2161.28 - 2166.00] with me skin inflammation you know we
[2164.24 - 2167.48] also you know we see inflammation as the
[2166.00 - 2170.04] body attacking itself that's a whole
[2167.48 - 2172.68] another thing the body's attacking
[2170.04 - 2174.88] itself you know autoimmune that's a
[2172.68 - 2176.44] disaster disaster the body doesn't
[2174.88 - 2179.48] attack itself I said it a million times
[2176.44 - 2181.60] in these shows inflammation there's a
[2179.48 - 2183.52] cause for inflammation and the cause
[2181.60 - 2184.64] will never be the body attacking itself
[2183.52 - 2187.12] and that's what happens with liver
[2184.64 - 2189.12] problems too with mystery liver mystery
[2187.12 - 2191.60] liver inflammation inflammation and be
[2189.12 - 2193.76] like well it's autoimmune in liver it's
[2191.60 - 2197.00] autoimmune hepatic problems it's
[2193.76 - 2199.08] autoimmune uh um going on in the liver a
[2197.00 - 2201.12] doctor will say profession will say
[2199.08 - 2204.04] medical communities is say no there's a
[2201.12 - 2209.32] cause so you
[2204.04 - 2210.72] know here the bottom line is is that the
[2209.32 - 2212.52] body doesn't attack itself we get
[2210.72 - 2217.44] inflamed for those two reasons I told
[2212.52 - 2220.76] you you can cut get a cut it's an injury
[2217.44 - 2224.40] you can get dental work it's an
[2220.76 - 2226.40] injury you can get an injury it's you
[2224.40 - 2229.16] know you could bang your elbow against a
[2226.40 - 2231.44] wall it's an injury you can get hit by
[2229.16 - 2235.40] something it's an injury the other one
[2231.44 - 2237.52] is the other side is pathogen Invader
[2235.40 - 2239.16] okay whatever that Invader sinus
[2237.52 - 2240.68] inflammation whole another one whole
[2239.16 - 2243.08] another one inflame sinuses that's
[2240.68 - 2245.12] always strap that's strap that's inside
[2243.08 - 2247.68] the the the canal sinus Canal that's
[2245.12 - 2249.44] that's always strap inside the Linings
[2247.68 - 2252.08] sitting in there forever I'm not talking
[2249.44 - 2253.56] about when someone has a bout of strep
[2252.08 - 2255.08] and they got the fever in the strep
[2253.56 - 2256.84] throat and it's at that stage talking
[2255.08 - 2258.88] about chronic long-term bending your
[2256.84 - 2261.04] system since you're a child sitting in
[2258.88 - 2261.04] the
[2261.08 - 2266.20] sinuses unless you catch the flu cuz
[2264.68 - 2268.92] there really are no
[2266.20 - 2270.88] colds it's really all flu it dominated
[2268.92 - 2273.60] there are no just Rhino viruses anymore
[2270.88 - 2275.24] those are those are dead and gone those
[2273.60 - 2277.96] got taken
[2275.24 - 2282.32] over that's the flu is the flu is the
[2277.96 - 2285.56] owner of all colds whether small great
[2282.32 - 2287.36] large the flu is the owner of them so
[2285.56 - 2288.96] you get the flu whether it's in the
[2287.36 - 2291.40] spring because there's a flu every every
[2288.96 - 2294.12] two months All Summer Long all spring
[2291.40 - 2295.64] long all winter long it there there
[2294.12 - 2299.00] there's a flu going
[2295.64 - 2300.96] on causing inflammation when it gets in
[2299.00 - 2302.56] you that week or two man you're inflamed
[2300.96 - 2304.68] I it could blow out your adrenals it can
[2302.56 - 2307.24] inflame everything the flu inflames the
[2304.68 - 2309.48] gut it's a virus it's an invader it
[2307.24 - 2311.32] gives you sinuses in inflammation chest
[2309.48 - 2313.60] inflammation causes bronchitis you're
[2311.32 - 2315.16] coughing your butt off it's inflaming
[2313.60 - 2318.52] your
[2315.16 - 2319.92] lungs so you know and then eye
[2318.52 - 2321.68] inflammation you can have eye
[2319.92 - 2325.16] inflammation from anything any kind of
[2321.68 - 2327.52] meaning any kind of bacteria gets in
[2325.16 - 2330.24] there sty you're you know you touch a
[2327.52 - 2332.36] door handle you're going into an office
[2330.24 - 2334.80] building and 50 people grabbed that
[2332.36 - 2336.36] handle and didn't wash their hands when
[2334.80 - 2338.44] they went to bathroom that morning or
[2336.36 - 2341.16] came came from the coffee shop and
[2338.44 - 2344.80] touched every dirty handle and device
[2341.16 - 2346.56] there is and didn't use a handy wipe and
[2344.80 - 2348.36] they're all touching the door at the
[2346.56 - 2350.12] office and you just go and grab that
[2348.36 - 2352.16] door and open it up and you're running
[2350.12 - 2353.80] into a coworker and they got you busy
[2352.16 - 2355.76] and then you rub your eye and now you
[2353.80 - 2357.68] got a sty or you rub your eye and you
[2355.76 - 2359.64] got the flu three days later four days
[2357.68 - 2362.40] later or you rub your eye and you got
[2359.64 - 2364.88] some other staff in there causing it to
[2362.40 - 2368.44] run and and and give you like sneezing
[2364.88 - 2370.16] and running because that's how you get
[2368.44 - 2374.00] the inflammation in
[2370.16 - 2375.44] there glaucoma glaucoma is a virus
[2374.00 - 2376.96] that's actually one of the viruses from
[2375.44 - 2379.12] the Epstein bar family one of the
[2376.96 - 2380.96] mutated forms that goes after the eyes
[2379.12 - 2382.52] causes eye problems like glaucoma it's a
[2380.96 - 2383.72] whole different kind if you got Epstein
[2382.52 - 2385.68] bar doesn't mean you have any of the
[2383.72 - 2387.52] Epstein bar varieties that do any of
[2385.68 - 2388.64] this there's a lot of different
[2387.52 - 2389.96] varieties I could talk about the
[2388.64 - 2391.32] different groups of medical meum book
[2389.96 - 2392.48] one if you don't have medical medium
[2391.32 - 2397.52] book one and you're listening to the
[2392.48 - 2399.56] show I I'm sad I'm sad
[2397.52 - 2400.48] I want you to get it because you need to
[2399.56 - 2402.44] read
[2400.48 - 2405.84] it and
[2402.44 - 2408.84] um anyway so so that's giving you a kind
[2405.84 - 2410.52] of the gist on this of how it works like
[2408.84 - 2413.24] what's happening and giving information
[2410.52 - 2416.04] around all these things neurological
[2413.24 - 2417.72] inflammation nerve inflammation
[2416.04 - 2420.44] fibromyalgia
[2417.72 - 2423.60] fibromyalgia severe chronic fatigue
[2420.44 - 2425.20] syndrome chronic fatigue syndrome is is
[2423.60 - 2427.16] is uh brain inflammation it's
[2425.20 - 2429.20] neurological fatigue very mild brain
[2427.16 - 2432.32] inflammation somebody can't do anything
[2429.20 - 2434.40] they can't even function their brain's
[2432.32 - 2437.64] inflamed
[2434.40 - 2439.64] and the uh the fibromyalgia but you know
[2437.64 - 2442.60] inflammation is not enough you go to the
[2439.64 - 2444.68] best specialist there is with
[2442.60 - 2447.96] CFS I mean all the different varieties
[2444.68 - 2449.84] of CFS they keep on renaming it all the
[2447.96 - 2451.76] different varieties of
[2449.84 - 2453.80] CFS you know you go to the best
[2451.76 - 2455.52] specialist they might you might get
[2453.80 - 2458.08] somebody to say you know I think you had
[2455.52 - 2459.40] brain inflammation
[2458.08 - 2464.36] but from
[2459.40 - 2467.40] what from what virus we're still so far
[2464.36 - 2469.96] off we're still so far off I mean I'm
[2467.40 - 2473.08] lucky I don't know about lucky but I
[2469.96 - 2475.32] could ask spirit and say well what wood
[2473.08 - 2477.12] virus is in this person's brain that's
[2475.32 - 2479.20] inflaming them so bad that they can't
[2477.12 - 2481.88] get out of bed at all and they can't
[2479.20 - 2483.72] even walk or talk what virus is it and
[2481.88 - 2486.68] spirit will tell me spirit will say well
[2483.72 - 2488.48] it's you know it's Epstein bar spirit
[2486.68 - 2490.20] will say it's Epstein bar and shingles
[2488.48 - 2492.40] it's both spirit will say it's Epstein
[2490.20 - 2495.40] bar shingles and
[2492.40 - 2497.12] hhv6 you know I'm lucky I can get that
[2495.40 - 2498.08] so I can get the information for people
[2497.12 - 2501.04] in the
[2498.08 - 2504.56] world but you need you go into you go
[2501.04 - 2506.40] into chronic illness world of today and
[2504.56 - 2509.28] you just can't get
[2506.40 - 2511.12] answers and and yeah sure I didn't
[2509.28 - 2512.80] realize that when I was when I was 10
[2511.12 - 2515.24] years old 11 years old Spirit kept on
[2512.80 - 2517.96] telling me and said you don't understand
[2515.24 - 2519.36] Anthony this has to get out there and
[2517.96 - 2522.56] you have to work harder on it and you
[2519.36 - 2524.20] have to care you also have to care and I
[2522.56 - 2528.44] do
[2524.20 - 2531.88] um you know this just kills me actually
[2528.44 - 2534.56] so what people go through
[2531.88 - 2536.52] so let's talk about some other things
[2534.56 - 2538.40] with this with all of this so we got the
[2536.52 - 2539.76] fibromyalgia I was mentioning we got the
[2538.40 - 2541.16] rheumatoid arthritis which is
[2539.76 - 2542.80] inflammation that's not the body
[2541.16 - 2544.84] attacking itself they're going to chalk
[2542.80 - 2546.36] up fibro eventually to being completely
[2544.84 - 2547.52] autoimmune which I think they already
[2546.36 - 2550.28] did I think they might have thrown that
[2547.52 - 2551.84] one in there by now where the body's you
[2550.28 - 2554.12] know body's destroying
[2551.84 - 2556.12] itself and the body's not destroying
[2554.12 - 2559.56] itself cu the body doesn't attack itself
[2556.12 - 2562.28] the body is there helping you protecting
[2559.56 - 2565.64] you and an Invader is causing the
[2562.28 - 2567.60] inflammation so you know here's here's
[2565.64 - 2570.36] the deal with inflammatory
[2567.60 - 2572.84] tests let's cover a couple of them all
[2570.36 - 2576.16] right you got the C reactive protein
[2572.84 - 2578.36] test which is worthless because it's
[2576.16 - 2581.00] it's just roundabout getting you know
[2578.36 - 2582.92] looking for inflammation in in different
[2581.00 - 2584.44] ways this is just just to let the doctor
[2582.92 - 2587.44] know there's
[2584.44 - 2590.48] inflammation and then you have the ESR
[2587.44 - 2592.68] Rosy sedimentation rate I don't know if
[2590.48 - 2595.60] you've ever had that one but that's
[2592.68 - 2600.00] another one the doctor can order at the
[2595.60 - 2603.68] lab and that one is just another type of
[2600.00 - 2605.72] inflammatory test to see if you got some
[2603.68 - 2608.24] some type of inflammation and maybe they
[2605.72 - 2610.16] can throw a bogus label like lupus on
[2608.24 - 2611.76] you because they don't even know what
[2610.16 - 2613.52] lupus is or how it works or anything I
[2611.76 - 2616.32] don't even the best guys don't even know
[2613.52 - 2619.60] yet and I wish they did I I say these
[2616.32 - 2621.88] things because I hope it's it it
[2619.60 - 2623.56] instigates someone to say okay I am
[2621.88 - 2625.72] going to go out and find those answers I
[2623.56 - 2627.96] am going to get funding without without
[2625.72 - 2629.84] the thumb scale being pushed by by you
[2627.96 - 2632.04] know by interest groups I am going to
[2629.84 - 2634.12] get clean funding I am going to get the
[2632.04 - 2635.40] answers for this so we can figure it out
[2634.12 - 2637.08] I'm I'm not going to just blame
[2635.40 - 2638.52] everything on genes anymore because
[2637.08 - 2640.56] that's where science wants to go because
[2638.52 - 2642.68] that's where the money's going and so it
[2640.56 - 2644.44] puts the blame on you I want to find the
[2642.68 - 2647.12] answers that's what I hope someday
[2644.44 - 2649.60] because I can't do this alone and you
[2647.12 - 2651.12] know I rely on you guys too you know
[2649.60 - 2653.96] getting the information out so there's
[2651.12 - 2655.72] another test called PV plasma viscosity
[2653.96 - 2659.16] it's another inflammatory
[2655.72 - 2661.40] test and but that's another one that
[2659.16 - 2664.04] that just looks for around about
[2661.40 - 2667.48] inflammation okay there's another test
[2664.04 - 2670.56] IG you you guys know the IgA
[2667.48 - 2673.56] test and what about the you know
[2670.56 - 2677.28] immunoglobulin G test which is
[2673.56 - 2680.44] IGG you know that one okay it's just an
[2677.28 - 2682.76] inflammatory test that's what that is in
[2680.44 - 2685.40] the end you still don't know what is
[2682.76 - 2688.04] causing the inflammation this is so
[2685.40 - 2691.48] important to know I hope I'm not boring
[2688.04 - 2695.20] you guys today I'm hoping I hope I'm not
[2691.48 - 2698.16] I hope I'm not um ana anti-nuclear
[2695.20 - 2700.12] antibod test and we also call it antibod
[2698.16 - 2701.76] antinuclear antigen test I've seen you
[2700.12 - 2702.96] know a lot of practitioners call it that
[2701.76 - 2707.60] I've called it
[2702.96 - 2709.60] that and that's one too round about
[2707.60 - 2712.08] inflammation liver
[2709.60 - 2715.36] enzyme blood work
[2712.08 - 2718.00] test that's another one that's another
[2715.36 - 2719.72] one and it's got a couple of cousins too
[2718.00 - 2722.56] there's a couple of cousins also that
[2719.72 - 2725.24] are being used meaning cousins not
[2722.56 - 2726.56] people but uh tests called cousins
[2725.24 - 2728.52] Sister Sister
[2726.56 - 2730.08] sister tests of some of these liver
[2728.52 - 2733.08] enzymes and other these tests that are
[2730.08 - 2735.16] being developed but they're just for
[2733.08 - 2737.52] inflammation they don't discover what's
[2735.16 - 2741.00] wrong and the cause of your inflammation
[2737.52 - 2744.32] and that's where it hurts man that's
[2741.00 - 2746.92] where it hurts I call these guest tests
[2744.32 - 2749.24] these are called guest tests that's what
[2746.92 - 2751.48] they are and here's the problem here's
[2749.24 - 2753.52] the scary part here's the problem that
[2751.48 - 2755.40] really Spooks me if there's something
[2753.52 - 2757.32] that wakes me up at night I'm going to
[2755.40 - 2760.72] tell you what it it is and if this gets
[2757.32 - 2762.88] you angry if this gets you angry just
[2760.72 - 2765.52] you know don't don't quit listening to
[2762.88 - 2767.40] the shows because I need your help I
[2765.52 - 2771.32] need you learning this information don't
[2767.40 - 2773.64] quit listening to the shows don't stop
[2771.32 - 2778.88] you know don't get
[2773.64 - 2781.20] mad but here's the problem all those um
[2778.88 - 2783.04] inflammatory guest tests are being used
[2781.20 - 2784.52] against us with Lyme disease because
[2783.04 - 2786.52] what they're doing is they're filling in
[2784.52 - 2788.40] the blank they're putting in their own
[2786.52 - 2790.92] names of bacteria next to those
[2788.40 - 2793.52] inflammatory markers but yet not finding
[2790.92 - 2795.72] the bacteria itself and that's what
[2793.52 - 2798.84] they're doing all at the new
[2795.72 - 2801.36] labs and it's painstaking and
[2798.84 - 2803.00] painful and so then you know you get a
[2801.36 - 2804.40] lime D so all you need is a little bit
[2803.00 - 2807.48] of inflammation and you got a lime
[2804.40 - 2808.92] diagnosis now like honestly everything's
[2807.48 - 2810.56] getting funnel to Lime before you
[2808.92 - 2811.92] explode or get mad listen to my lime
[2810.56 - 2815.52] show or I'm going to do an update at
[2811.92 - 2817.40] lime show or or go to the lime chapter
[2815.52 - 2819.24] and medical meeting book one if you if
[2817.40 - 2820.60] you haven't gotten that you have to get
[2819.24 - 2822.92] that you can't just get mad at me for
[2820.60 - 2824.68] talking about Lyme disease because of a
[2822.92 - 2826.88] ingrained belief system you might have
[2824.68 - 2829.20] and not get that chapter out of medical
[2826.88 - 2831.84] medium book one and read it it's unfair
[2829.20 - 2833.60] you got to you got to get it and read
[2831.84 - 2836.32] it
[2833.60 - 2837.96] and even I mean really cuz I want to
[2836.32 - 2840.36] help it's about helping and if you're
[2837.96 - 2842.92] suffering even more so
[2840.36 - 2845.80] reason even more so
[2842.92 - 2848.20] reason so what happens is the all the
[2845.80 - 2849.76] anti-inflammatory tests are being used
[2848.20 - 2851.12] in the labs and it's a disconnect from
[2849.76 - 2852.80] the doctor the doctor who orders the
[2851.12 - 2854.12] Lyme disease test has no clue that the
[2852.80 - 2855.44] labs are actually taking all those
[2854.12 - 2857.80] inflammatory tests and then they're
[2855.44 - 2860.00] filling in the blank with the
[2857.80 - 2861.96] bacteria if that wasn't the case there
[2860.00 - 2864.16] would never be a borderline you either
[2861.96 - 2867.56] have it or you don't you either have the
[2864.16 - 2869.60] bacteria whether it's Boreal b bellia or
[2867.56 - 2871.04] some other bacteria or babesia whatever
[2869.60 - 2873.88] it is a parasite whatever it is you
[2871.04 - 2876.44] think you have it's either you have it
[2873.88 - 2880.04] or you don't
[2876.44 - 2882.72] not borderline so when the labs do the
[2880.04 - 2884.56] inflammatory tests and they put the name
[2882.72 - 2887.20] bellia next to a little bit of
[2884.56 - 2889.20] inflammation on the score sheet ship it
[2887.20 - 2892.00] to the doctor and the doctor has no idea
[2889.20 - 2893.76] that they didn't identify the bug why do
[2892.00 - 2896.36] you think so many people come back
[2893.76 - 2898.88] borderline you either have the bug or
[2896.36 - 2900.12] you don't it's one of the mistakes that
[2898.88 - 2901.40] they're probably going to fix it the
[2900.12 - 2903.12] labs because they know someone's
[2901.40 - 2907.00] catching
[2903.12 - 2910.28] on just telling you
[2907.00 - 2911.60] so here's the deal here's the deal
[2910.28 - 2914.28] everything's getting funneled into
[2911.60 - 2916.72] inflammation but with no
[2914.28 - 2920.72] answers the only thing I like about the
[2916.72 - 2923.92] lime disease trap the lime trap which is
[2920.72 - 2925.32] very little the only thing I like is
[2923.92 - 2927.40] that they're actually equating
[2925.32 - 2928.72] inflammation to a pathogen even if they
[2927.40 - 2931.20] have the wrong
[2928.72 - 2933.40] pathogens even if they have the wrong
[2931.20 - 2935.88] pathogens even if they're picking on
[2933.40 - 2937.60] bacteria that isn't what's behind
[2935.88 - 2939.52] people's lme suffering and there's
[2937.60 - 2941.84] another pathogen behind people's Lyme
[2939.52 - 2942.96] suff suffering why do you think every 10
[2941.84 - 2943.76] years they're going to come up with a
[2942.96 - 2946.60] new
[2943.76 - 2948.24] bacteria and say then and then basically
[2946.60 - 2950.48] Outcast the old
[2948.24 - 2952.84] ones why do you think when Lyme disease
[2950.48 - 2954.28] was first discovered in 1973 when it was
[2952.84 - 2956.96] first discovered right around on that
[2954.28 - 2958.88] time the every doctor every doctor on
[2956.96 - 2960.96] every board knew it was viral and they
[2958.88 - 2962.36] all agreed it was viral but there was no
[2960.96 - 2964.12] treatment so they had to go to
[2962.36 - 2966.52] antibiotics and then demon bacteria
[2964.12 - 2968.76] later in 1981 the point
[2966.52 - 2971.64] is and if you're getting upset about
[2968.76 - 2973.16] this listen uh it's all good call listen
[2971.64 - 2974.72] it's all good let's you know we're going
[2973.16 - 2977.16] to do a new show on that we have to it's
[2974.72 - 2980.68] about time the bottom line
[2977.16 - 2982.52] is I'm just glad in the lime world
[2980.68 - 2985.04] they're equating inflammation to a
[2982.52 - 2986.88] pathogen thank God thank God I'm so
[2985.04 - 2989.40] happy for that so if you want if you
[2986.88 - 2991.64] want to know the truth I'm happy about
[2989.40 - 2993.44] something because that's the whole point
[2991.64 - 2995.16] like I said back to square one there's
[2993.44 - 2997.16] two things for inflammation there's
[2995.16 - 2999.12] injury and there's pathogen even if you
[2997.16 - 3000.60] got the wrong pathogen even if the
[2999.12 - 3002.00] doctors got the wrong pathogen they
[3000.60 - 3003.56] think it's a bacteria they don't think
[3002.00 - 3005.84] this even if the doctors don't know
[3003.56 - 3008.44] hepatitis C is Epstein bar even if the
[3005.84 - 3010.76] doctors don't know that this is you know
[3008.44 - 3013.40] this is this this inflammation from this
[3010.76 - 3016.04] is this kind of pathogen if they think
[3013.40 - 3019.08] pathogens related we've already moved
[3016.04 - 3021.16] forward thank God and that's the whole
[3019.08 - 3022.60] point and I love that part about it so
[3021.16 - 3025.52] don't get mad if you hear me talking
[3022.60 - 3026.88] about lime if you're a big lime fan just
[3025.52 - 3028.64] you know just look into what I've
[3026.88 - 3030.28] already talked about before and it'll
[3028.64 - 3031.92] make more sense because I can't do it
