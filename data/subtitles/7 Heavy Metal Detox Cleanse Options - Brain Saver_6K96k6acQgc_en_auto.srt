357
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:17,160

00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:30,060
today I'm just trying to give you guys a

364
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:33,660
little heads up

these brain shots prepare yourself

367
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:43,260
because people are not used to getting

368
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:47,519
results right away in this world

369
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:49,560
they're not in alternative medicine

370
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:52,920
people and conventional medicine people

371
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:56,399

374
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:03,660

to prepare you

377
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,860

00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,720
people don't get results

379
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:15,480

pathogen exposure shot talked about this

393
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:50,880
a little bit yesterday toxic fragrances

394
00:15:47,959 --> 00:15:52,260

395
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:56,220

396
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:57,540
mold exposure EMF and 5G exposure so I'm

397
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,740
just going through some of them but I'm

398
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:01,279
going to move out of the brain shot

399
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:01,279
therapy

400
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:10,860
well actually let's talk about the

401
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:15,440
different levels there's seven

402
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:15,440
brain shot therapy cleanse levels

403
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:23,279
so the first level is entry level

404
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:25,680
so if you want to Embark into that or

405
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:28,019
try that you do the entry level

406
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:30,779
second one is

407
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:32,880
basic so it's the basic brain shot

408
00:16:30,779 --> 00:16:35,519
therapy cleanse

409
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:37,860

412
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:45,839

seventh level is high powered brain shot

417
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:58,680
therapy clouds

418
00:16:55,620 --> 00:17:00,899
and remember what I was saying before

419
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:02,820
even if you're just doing them singly

420
00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:04,500
like you're not doing the brain shot

421
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,819
therapy cleanses but you're doing the

422
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:09,120
brain shots

423
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:12,720
that when you partake in those

424
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:15,240
be prepared to actually feel something

425
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,640
what happens in alternative medicine no

426
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:21,000
matter what you do where you go

427
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:24,120
getting instant quick

428
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,040
results or relief is not something

429
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:28,860
that's heard of out there

430
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:31,740
but this is the medical medium stuff and

431
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:34,820
this is the brain saver books

432
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:34,820
so look out

433
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:40,280
and

434
00:17:42,539 --> 00:17:48,080
we're in brain saver right here and

435
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:48,080
we're braid saver protocols

436
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,960
so the whole thing about with brain

437
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:53,820
shots what are they let's clarify that

438
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:56,220
right now I'll give you a little window

439
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:58,860
into what they are just so you know

440
00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:02,160
here's the mood shifter right here if

441
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:04,260
you see you see a glass

442
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:08,460
that glass is filled with roughly around

443
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:10,740
two ounces that's a shot glass

444
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:13,620
so they're brain shots because they're

445
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:15,960
small quantities

446
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:18,000
of medicinals

447
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:19,740
medicinal food

448
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,720
and then what happens is when you

449
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:23,520
actually turn it into the shot through

450
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:25,140
the recipe that you have here in the

451
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,120
brain saver book

452
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:29,039

453
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:31,679
show you another one right here just so

454
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:34,799

there you go

457
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:42,980

458
00:18:39,059 --> 00:18:42,980

00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,380

466
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:08,700

what is offered in the brand saver books

569
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:20,460
is to move that needle no matter what it

570
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:22,260
takes

571
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:25,679
and medical meme information has already

572
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:28,679
done that for people but we're coming on

573
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:33,059
in history in the next

574
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:34,500
five years even now and moving forward

575
00:23:33,059 --> 00:23:36,000
that

576
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,980
we're going to be up against so much

577
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,020
more with our bodies

578
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:41,220
so much more corruption in the

579
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:46,440
industries

580
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:48,960
so much more exposure with pathogens

581
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:51,240
that we have to keep up with it and we

582
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,760
have to make sure that everybody has a

583
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:56,760
chance to move the needle

584
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:58,440
so it's really an incredible exciting

585
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:00,900
moment in time right now for the brand

586
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:03,240

incredible Lisa you just received the

612
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:03,860
books Alexandria

613
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,860
amazing

614
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:07,500
so

615
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:08,700
give you a quick rundown on the books a

616
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,780
little bit if you guys aren't familiar

617
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:12,600
with it

618
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:15,120
there's over 300 symptoms and conditions

619
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:16,980
in these books many of the symptoms and

620
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:19,380
conditions explain in detail now there's

621
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:22,080
an eating disorder chapter

622
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:25,620
that's on a level no one is ever going

623
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:29,580
to expect really it's mind-blowing so

624
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:32,340
that chapter alone is just

625
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:33,960
lots of incredible information so I want

626
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:37,620
to give everybody a little window into

627
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:39,720
the book there's a blood draw chapter in

628
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:41,340
detail of how to protect yourself with

629
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:44,720
protocols on how to protect yourself

630
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:46,980
before you go for a blood test

631
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:50,039
protocols for how to protect yourself

632
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:51,840
after you had your blood test or blood

633
00:25:50,039 --> 00:25:55,980
drawn

634
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:57,900
so that's a big big plus inside these

635
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:59,460
books all on its own

636
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:01,020
and I've talked about it if you're new

637
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:04,559
to Medical medium information you might

638
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:06,240
not know about what happens when you get

639
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:08,580
your blood drawn

640
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,980
and how it weakens your immune system

641
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:14,460
and that your bone marrow has to go in

642
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:17,000
overdrive to produce immune cells and as

643
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:20,400
we get sicker and have mystery symptoms

644
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:23,940
our doctors and Specialists they order

645
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:25,980
more blood so they want more blood drawn

646
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:28,200
so now you're into a lot more vials of

647
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:30,600
blood then you lose more of your immune

648
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:32,340
system and then your bone marrow has to

649
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:35,760
go into overdrive again

650
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:37,620
and then your condition worsens

651
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:40,020
so medical meme information has been

652
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:41,700
about doing it right

653
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:43,620
teaching your doctor

654
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:45,120
about your blood draw

655
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:47,340
making sure that you can protect

656
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:49,620
yourself at the same time and in the

657
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:51,659
brain saver books there's a blood draw

658
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:54,059
protocol

659
00:26:51,659 --> 00:26:57,120
for before you have to go and get your

660
00:26:54,059 --> 00:26:58,860
blood drawn and after you get your blood

661
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:02,220
drawn

662
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:03,840
and so that's a huge deal on its own

663
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:05,880
Michelle L says I had so much blood

664
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:08,220
drawn I can't believe it

665
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:10,380
but it's incredible to know about the

666
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:13,760
information in here for blood draws

667
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:13,760
so there's that all in its own

668
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:19,080
anyway you guys just wanted to let you

669
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:22,140
