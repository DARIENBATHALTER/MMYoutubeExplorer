[1333.28 - 1337.80] and pains and different symptoms and we
[1334.72 - 1340.12] reverse this what what does that mean
[1337.80 - 1342.40] someone was asking about ingredients
[1340.12 - 1344.60] which ones are in it I saw that too and
[1342.40 - 1347.16] I have to go and run run by this again
[1344.60 - 1349.36] if you guys don't mind barley grass
[1347.16 - 1351.92] juice powder that's one of of the
[1349.36 - 1353.76] five barley grass juice powder now don't
[1351.92 - 1355.08] get this confused with barley grass cuz
[1353.76 - 1357.48] people just go to the store they buy
[1355.08 - 1359.92] barley grass that ain't going to do it
[1357.48 - 1361.92] uh uh uh it's not going to do it it's
[1359.92 - 1363.72] not has to be the barley grass juicee
[1361.92 - 1364.88] pattern that this is the vimergy barley
[1363.72 - 1366.56] grass juicee pattern it's the one I
[1364.88 - 1369.12] endorse it's the one I work with and
[1366.56 - 1371.48] endorse because it's incredible it's
[1369.12 - 1374.16] that good so I stand behind it
[1371.48 - 1375.96] wholeheartedly stand behind it I know
[1374.16 - 1378.04] how good it is I know there's no binders
[1375.96 - 1379.12] in here there's no agents hidden in here
[1378.04 - 1380.76] did you know they do that in all the
[1379.12 - 1382.28] powders out there they have all these
[1380.76 - 1384.04] secret binders that aren't on the
[1382.28 - 1386.96] ingredient list did you guys know that
[1384.04 - 1388.96] they so so that it doesn't Clump up do
[1386.96 - 1390.36] you know like no one realizes this they
[1388.96 - 1391.60] go and they buy powders and different
[1390.36 - 1393.92] things and it's all got these
[1391.60 - 1396.48] anti-caking agents in there so that it
[1393.92 - 1398.60] doesn't Clump up I don't care about a
[1396.48 - 1401.48] clump I don't want garbage in my
[1398.60 - 1403.04] products I don't care if there's a clump
[1401.48 - 1406.88] like if barley grass cheese powder
[1403.04 - 1409.04] clumped together and so what who wants
[1406.88 - 1411.40] anti-caking agents that no one even
[1409.04 - 1414.92] knows what it is it could be anything it
[1411.40 - 1416.76] could be GMO corn powder I mean think
[1414.92 - 1417.96] about that right anyway this is one of
[1416.76 - 1420.68] the five ingredients right here the
[1417.96 - 1423.60] vimergy barley grass juice powder all
[1420.68 - 1425.56] right the vimer spirulina that's another
[1423.60 - 1428.32] one of the five ingredients right there

[2661.80 - 2666.76] taking more of it because you know you
[2663.96 - 2668.80] know exposures radiation exposures for
[2666.76 - 2670.88] flood everything every exposure that
[2668.80 - 2673.92] wants to knock your immune system down
[2670.88 - 2675.64] right cuz that's what happens exposures
[2673.92 - 2677.44] want to knock your immune system down

[2709.80 - 2712.40] thrown at me right now is there
[2711.20 - 2713.84] something else that can be thrown at me

[2713.84 - 2718.24] propolis right here this is propolis
[2715.96 - 2720.28] pure from vimergy that right there I
[2718.24 - 2721.84] know so many people use and it's helped
[2720.28 - 2724.84] them so much you use it every day too
[2721.84 - 2727.52] you use it too incredible I mean the
[2724.84 - 2730.12] stuff is just incredible it really is
[2727.52 - 2732.84] okay I can't get into my cupboard here
[2730.12 - 2735.84] cuz I got the the dummy in the way but
[2732.84 - 2738.92] um maybe I do have something here I Cano
[2735.84 - 2741.92] that's a noise oh who who I don't know I
[2738.92 - 2741.92] know
[2743.00 - 2747.52] n
[2744.52 - 2750.76] tried crispy perspective you would
[2747.52 - 2753.76] choose propolis over the immune blend
[2750.76 - 2756.60] well if you're only going to take one
[2753.76 - 2759.00] thing and one thing only like if you
[2756.60 - 2760.96] just there's just one thing only and
[2759.00 - 2763.56] that's all you're going to take I would
[2760.96 - 2765.40] take the propolis for me personally but
[2763.56 - 2766.92] I'm going to take the total immune and
[2765.40 - 2770.68] the propolis cuz I'm going to take more
[2766.92 - 2772.00] than one thing okay there's a lot of
[2770.68 - 2773.44] people they don't have the room they
[2772.00 - 2775.20] don't have enough room in their bag they
[2773.44 - 2777.20] can't pack enough they can't take all
[2775.20 - 2778.72] their supplements I got friends that are
[2777.20 - 2780.68] just like I just need to take one thing
[2778.72 - 2782.12] tell me what it is I'm traveling right
[2780.68 - 2783.44] now to Europe I just need to take one
[2782.12 - 2786.36] thing what is it I'll say take the
[2783.44 - 2788.44] propolis take the propolis it's great
[2786.36 - 2790.64] it's so great it's so great
[2788.44 - 2793.44] so I'm going to put some propolis right
[2790.64 - 2794.96] in here if you guys don't mind I am
[2793.44 - 2798.40] going to do that
[2794.96 - 2800.28] now okay little purpl right here if you

[2800.28 - 2805.68] that in there all right okay I'm going
[2803.64 - 2807.24] to try not to spill it everywhere I'm
[2805.68 - 2809.32] going to do the best I can I'm going to
[2807.24 - 2813.32] put another one if you guys don't mind

[2817.56 - 2822.88] I'll pour some more in and just directly
[2820.56 - 2824.64] okay so let me just pour some more in
[2822.88 - 2827.48] directly if you guys don't mind I want
[2824.64 - 2828.68] to show you what it looks like here okay
[2827.48 - 2831.32] and I'm going to show you up close a
[2828.68 - 2833.64] little bit let me just get some in
[2831.32 - 2835.04] here what what I'm going to have to do
[2833.64 - 2837.60] now cuz I probably won't put that back
[2835.04 - 2839.72] in the bottle is I'll probably be
[2837.60 - 2843.28] sipping that throughout the
[2839.72 - 2845.32] day and tomorrow and so forth right okay
[2843.28 - 2847.48] clean up my mess right here let me see
[2845.32 - 2851.36] if I can put it right on my hand right
[2847.48 - 2855.20] here let me see the best way to show you
[2851.36 - 2856.48] what this looks like don't don't drop or
[2855.20 - 2859.80] anything
[2856.48 - 2862.48] please huh cameras aren't working so I
[2859.80 - 2864.32] can't really do that zoom in on it you
[2862.48 - 2867.48] guys it's Liquid
[2864.32 - 2870.40] Gold it's Liquid Gold that's what that
[2867.48 - 2873.48] propolis is right there it is liquid
[2870.40 - 2876.84] gold it's hard to say okay total immune
[2873.48 - 2879.20] is so good such in first of all I take
[2876.84 - 2880.64] take total immune every single day okay
[2879.20 - 2883.52] but I'm just telling people if they can
[2880.64 - 2885.44] only take one thing and one thing only I
[2883.52 - 2887.88] I I would probably take the
[2885.44 - 2890.68] propolis and
[2887.88 - 2893.96] um but if but if it was the total immune
[2890.68 - 2896.16] fine it's so powerful it's also so
[2893.96 - 2897.64] incredible it it's hard to say it's hard
[2896.16 - 2899.28] to say it depends on what's also going
[2897.64 - 2900.84] on with you too like you could ask your
[2899.28 - 2903.68] doctor like what's the best best thing
[2900.84 - 2906.40] for me right now but yeah I mean golden
[2903.68 - 2908.52] seal okay here's what I'm taking okay
