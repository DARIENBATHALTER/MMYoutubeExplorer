[0.68 - 4.92] hello I'm Anthony William and you're
[3.12 - 7.04] listening to the medical medium radio
[4.92 - 9.72] show where each week I talk about the
[7.04 - 11.48] most advanced healing information and
[9.72 - 14.12] secrets about health much of which is
[11.48 - 16.44] not found anywhere else and is decades
[14.12 - 19.40] ahead of what's out there now if you're
[16.44 - 20.96] brand new to this show just so you know
[19.40 - 23.76] cuz this is really important this is the
[20.96 - 28.44] only Health show anywhere where the
[23.76 - 30.00] information here isn't agenda driven
[28.44 - 31.20] that's really important to know that
[30.00 - 33.24] means the information doesn't come from
[31.20 - 35.08] interest groups originally medical
[33.24 - 37.16] funding with strings attached botched
[35.08 - 38.84] research with the thumb on the scale to
[37.16 - 41.20] make things go a certain way because
[38.84 - 44.08] tons of money went into something and
[41.20 - 46.84] believe it or not you should believe it
[44.08 - 49.80] cuz this is true in alternative medicine
[46.84 - 52.16] included there is thumb on the scale
[49.80 - 54.68] deep within it it wasn't it wasn't like
[52.16 - 56.24] that a long long time ago this is the
[54.68 - 58.40] only show that doesn't have any medical
[56.24 - 60.68] lobbyists information that might have
[58.40 - 62.88] been you know driven from that in the
[60.68 - 64.76] past internal Kickbacks persuaded belief
[62.88 - 67.88] systems all those persuaded belief
[64.76 - 71.24] systems those things are potent you
[67.88 - 74.16] can't change somebody's mind if they've
[71.24 - 76.72] been if they you know if they believe so
[74.16 - 79.08] strongly in something and doesn't matter
[76.72 - 81.72] if you hand them the truth on a silver
[79.08 - 83.32] platter in front of them you can't
[81.72 - 85.16] change their mind there's people out
[83.32 - 87.92] there you can't there's nothing you can
[85.16 - 89.52] do to break that belief system I don't
[87.92 - 91.76] know if you've ever run into that before
[89.52 - 93.40] run to anybody like that before well
[91.76 - 96.16] there's persuaded belief systems
[93.40 - 98.80] involved with private panels of
[96.16 - 101.04] influencers behind conventional and
[98.80 - 104.12] alternative medicine let's not forget
[101.04 - 106.08] about health field payoffs and trendy
[104.12 - 108.64] traps which are actually really annoying
[106.08 - 111.12] I talk about trendy traps this is the
[108.64 - 113.56] only show where the information I share
[111.12 - 116.16] from that I share with you comes from a
[113.56 - 118.76] pure untampered with Advanced Clean
[116.16 - 120.08] Source a higher source a gift that was
[118.76 - 122.12] given to me which I've called called The
[120.08 - 125.76] Curse over the years because I always
[122.12 - 127.44] hear it non-stop since the age four when
[125.76 - 129.76] I diagnosed my grandmother of lung
[127.44 - 132.32] cancer that's when it all started for me
[129.76 - 134.60] and this Source has been helping out
[132.32 - 137.84] tens of thousands of people throughout
[134.60 - 139.84] my entire lifetime and I've dedicated my
[137.84 - 142.44] I've had to dedicate my whole life to
[139.84 - 144.72] this and nothing but this this isn't
[142.44 - 148.08] something that started three years ago
[144.72 - 150.32] or 2 years ago or 7 years ago or 12
[148.08 - 152.88] years ago and goes on and go goes on and
[150.32 - 155.84] goes on it's a voice I've heard that's
[152.88 - 157.92] guided people in the right direction and
[155.84 - 161.04] but like I said before you know you can
[157.92 - 163.96] have the truth in your hands doesn't
[161.04 - 166.60] mean someone's going to accept it out
[163.96 - 168.24] there in the world it's a sad thing and
[166.60 - 169.88] and you know hey that's just how it
[168.24 - 173.08] works for so many reasons and when it
[169.88 - 176.52] comes down to vital healing information
[173.08 - 178.88] it's critical to Healing people to
[176.52 - 182.88] Healing people critical information that
[178.88 - 185.56] hasn't been touched by anything else for
[182.88 - 187.40] those agenda issues that are out there
[185.56 - 189.48] where it's just about you know money
[187.40 - 190.72] invested into research that research
[189.48 - 192.04] better come through with something
[190.72 - 195.20] because you're going to get a lot of
[192.04 - 197.92] investors mad this is clean pure stuff
[195.20 - 199.48] I'm saying that because right now in the
[197.92 - 200.76] industry people could be like oh what
[199.48 - 202.64] what did he hear this information
[200.76 - 204.64] somewhere and now he's talking about it
[202.64 - 206.72] oh wow what uh may you could probably
[204.64 - 210.40] find that on the internet no you can't
[206.72 - 212.08] anyway check out my book thyroid healing
[210.40 - 214.64] check that out as soon as you can you're
[212.08 - 216.44] not going to be disappointed you're not
[214.64 - 218.24] it's like like when life-changing Foods
[216.44 - 221.20] came out last year and I said on the
[218.24 - 225.76] radio show I said look I don't think I
[221.20 - 228.88] let you down I don't think I let you
[225.76 - 231.20] down I I I gave you everything I had I
[228.88 - 233.96] put information about food no one knows
[231.20 - 235.52] about that I got from Spirit and then
[233.96 - 237.96] what what did we hear when the book came
[235.52 - 239.96] out I've heard a numerous people out
[237.96 - 243.48] there saying you didn't let us down you
[239.96 - 245.48] didn't you didn't let us down you didn't
[243.48 - 248.16] you didn't and that's like well I I I
[245.48 - 251.08] think I did it again meaning got you
[248.16 - 253.64] something from Spirit information that's
[251.08 - 255.68] mindblowing that can help you heal about
[253.64 - 257.92] thyroid information you've never heard
[255.68 - 259.68] before and known about and I don't think
[257.92 - 262.84] I let you down and there's more than
[259.68 - 265.96] just that in this book so just get it
[262.84 - 269.04] when you can and you know I I really
[265.96 - 270.36] really want it in your hands like with
[269.04 - 272.16] everything I got not because that's
[270.36 - 275.00] that's the whole point that's the whole
[272.16 - 276.48] point you know I I get it look you know
[275.00 - 278.08] we people out there in the world we
[276.48 - 279.68] write books we try to get information
[278.08 - 281.96] out to help people and and everything
[279.68 - 283.88] else but you know when spirit's telling
[281.96 - 286.56] you this has this is critical and it has
[283.88 - 288.72] to go into writing and I've been hearing
[286.56 - 291.16] this my whole life I just never wanted
[288.72 - 293.36] to commit to the books I was doing all
[291.16 - 295.96] the I was I was in the trenches like so
[293.36 - 298.76] many amazing doctors and healers and
[295.96 - 300.08] practitioners and and people that are
[298.76 - 302.76] helping people when I was in the
[300.08 - 305.24] trenches and I was doing that for
[302.76 - 308.52] decades and and and many decades
[305.24 - 311.32] completely unpaid unpaid just for free
[308.52 - 313.52] until literally I was basically in in a
[311.32 - 316.52] in a dog house on the side of a riverbed
[313.52 - 318.68] on on Hay straw catching pneumonia and
[316.52 - 320.52] and then I realized okay well I have to
[318.68 - 323.32] of course survive like everybody else
[320.52 - 325.04] but the point is is that with all of
[323.32 - 328.40] that spirit is said you have to get this
[325.04 - 330.68] information in these books this is it
[328.40 - 332.28] has to be in there for people people so
[330.68 - 334.60] I hope you grab it I hope you grab it
[332.28 - 336.80] and take a look and read and I think
[334.60 - 339.48] you're going to be quite surprised um
[336.80 - 341.56] we're talking about pregnancy pregnancy
[339.48 - 343.84] today we did a pregnancy show before but
[341.56 - 347.56] this is a this is kind of an offshoot
[343.84 - 351.04] because I wanted to dedicate time and
[347.56 - 353.92] effort in into supplements and foods for
[351.04 - 356.44] pregnancy because it's such a big deal I
[353.92 - 358.56] mean a huge deal and it's not just the
[356.44 - 360.52] concerns and the questions and what do I
[358.56 - 362.88] take what do I it's more than that this
[360.52 - 365.68] is this is a child we're talking about
[362.88 - 367.16] this is life we're talking about and
[365.68 - 368.80] this is life we're bringing into the
[367.16 - 371.40] world this is life we've where we're
[368.80 - 374.48] dedicating our entire body and being and
[371.40 - 377.32] Life to and you know in order that you
[374.48 - 380.12] know we we get to the point that that
[377.32 - 381.84] success of of having a beautiful being
[380.12 - 385.80] in our hands and you know so this is
[381.84 - 387.24] important this is important and um so I
[385.80 - 389.00] really want to cover into that I got a
[387.24 - 391.36] couple of funny things to say I want to
[389.00 - 393.12] say something here okay before we go
[391.36 - 395.68] into that and this kind of relates to it
[393.12 - 397.84] cuz this isn't good for pregnancies but
[395.68 - 402.88] the world has been taken over it has
[397.84 - 405.88] been taken over yes literally taken over
[402.88 - 408.00] it's it's it's unbelievable what has
[405.88 - 410.52] happened what are you thinking in your
[408.00 - 411.84] mind what are you thinking in your in
[410.52 - 415.08] your Consciousness what are you thinking
[411.84 - 417.68] about in your in your thoughts right now
[415.08 - 420.76] the world has been taken over and it is
[417.68 - 423.76] evil it is evil that has done it and I'm
[420.76 - 426.28] going to tell you right now okay it is
[423.76 - 428.36] it is and I don't think it can be
[426.28 - 429.92] stopped I just don't think it can be
[428.36 - 431.84] stopped not this anyway I know I'm
[429.92 - 434.32] always positive about stuff and I'm like
[431.84 - 435.92] no no no no you know there's yes you we
[434.32 - 438.92] can move forward there's no question
[435.92 - 440.28] about it no matter what but in this
[438.92 - 441.84] little thing I got to tell you and I've
[440.28 - 443.72] talked about it before a little bit the
[441.84 - 447.16] world has been taken over what has it
[443.72 - 450.28] been taken over with in a disastrous way
[447.16 - 453.20] fragrant fragrance that chemically
[450.28 - 455.64] created in an oil base that you plug
[453.20 - 458.20] into your wall and you destroy your home
[455.64 - 463.04] and you and you invade everybody's lungs
[458.20 - 466.60] and invade the sinuses it's that bad
[463.04 - 470.08] fresheners air fresheners the worst
[466.60 - 473.36] invention on the planet possibly
[470.08 - 475.68] possibly destroying rental homes by the
[473.36 - 480.20] thousands and hundreds of
[475.68 - 482.48] thousands destroying vacation spots
[480.20 - 485.88] not that I go on vacation I don't know
[482.48 - 488.12] the last one I've had but the point is
[485.88 - 489.44] it's destroying vacation spots
[488.12 - 493.24] destroying I hear about this all the
[489.44 - 496.00] time destroying homes destroying
[493.24 - 497.52] offices you can't even go to a dentist
[496.00 - 500.40] office you can't without it being
[497.52 - 502.20] plugged in everywhere wreaking havoc and
[500.40 - 505.20] it's even getting into schools
[502.20 - 508.88] elementary schools high schools middle
[505.20 - 511.44] schools and and students in college are
[508.88 - 514.60] even plugging them into their dorms to
[511.44 - 516.96] mask to mask the smell of beer or the
[514.60 - 519.68] smell of partying or just the smell of
[516.96 - 523.56] just mold or whatever but these things
[519.68 - 527.56] are disastrous they're so antagonistic
[523.56 - 530.08] to the brain to the sinuses to the body
[527.56 - 533.32] it's not even funny I'm serious about
[530.08 - 535.00] this and it was getting bad years ago
[533.32 - 537.32] it's at a point now that's that's
[535.00 - 538.48] unbelievable is it good for pregnancy no
[537.32 - 540.80] I talked about that a little bit in the
[538.48 - 542.96] last pregnancy show it's not good for
[540.80 - 545.84] pregnancy so pull them out of the wall
[542.96 - 547.84] and throw them out pull them out of the
[545.84 - 550.00] wall and throw them out I don't care
[547.84 - 552.20] what brand it is what kind see what you
[550.00 - 554.32] have to understand something you have to
[552.20 - 556.64] understand I don't mean to so be so
[554.32 - 559.44] bossy by saying that but with this you
[556.64 - 561.68] just do okay this isn't like essential
[559.44 - 564.68] oil this isn't like a natural essential
[561.68 - 566.20] oil that you have in a little mister or
[564.68 - 567.64] or essential oil that you put on your
[566.20 - 570.00] wrist or essential oil that you put in
[567.64 - 572.84] the bathtub or anything like that that's
[570.00 - 574.84] not what this is this is unknown
[572.84 - 577.24] chemicals because the recipes will never
[574.84 - 579.76] be taught or told to you these are
[577.24 - 582.44] chemical factories with Vats of lethal
[579.76 - 584.68] highly toxic chemicals and they're just
[582.44 - 586.80] they're they're concentrated and
[584.68 - 589.48] concentrated and they're just completely
[586.80 - 591.72] synthesized in in the worst way possible
[589.48 - 594.48] this isn't this isn't like oh Touch of
[591.72 - 598.24] Rose a touch of this A Touch of that no
[594.48 - 601.20] it's not and it's horrendous on the
[598.24 - 603.36] sinus cavity the brain I won't even talk
[601.20 - 605.80] about what it can do to you because it's
[603.36 - 607.52] just it it's annoying as heck it can
[605.80 - 609.24] make people who suffer from problems
[607.52 - 612.00] make them worse make people who have
[609.24 - 613.48] fibromyalgia worse make people and look
[612.00 - 615.16] you can't be in fear about it you just
[613.48 - 617.08] got to plug them out you just got to
[615.16 - 618.76] unplug them I mean and you just got to
[617.08 - 621.52] throw them away that's what you got to
[618.76 - 622.64] do that's what you have to do I'm just
[621.52 - 624.00] telling you right now for the benefit of
[622.64 - 627.56] your childrena for yourself that's one
[624.00 - 630.36] thing I wanted to say so
[627.56 - 632.92] let's let's talk about supplements for
[630.36 - 635.20] for for children meaning meaning when
[632.92 - 637.68] they're still inside of us and and
[635.20 - 641.52] before they're inside of us let's do
[637.68 - 644.36] that and Foods so I want to give you a
[641.52 - 647.88] little history little history going
[644.36 - 651.48] back the supplement companies of the old
[647.88 - 655.76] day still exist now those are the bad
[651.48 - 656.88] ones the bad ones I say that because
[655.76 - 659.72] during the
[656.88 - 664.28] 1930s when alternative medicine was
[659.72 - 666.48] rising Rising up to help us all the the
[664.28 - 668.72] incredible herbalists the original
[666.48 - 670.92] nature doctors the original
[668.72 - 673.44] chiropractors the original anybody who
[670.92 - 674.80] was involved in the old days I mean they
[673.44 - 676.44] were being slaughtered left and right I
[674.80 - 677.60] talked about that all the time there
[676.44 - 679.80] because what happened was modern
[677.60 - 682.56] medicine was in a was was upset
[679.80 - 683.68] conventional medicine was so angry at at
[682.56 - 686.36] natural
[683.68 - 690.16] practitioners that they basically did an
[686.36 - 691.92] acis inquisition basically against them
[690.16 - 693.96] I'm I'm not kidding ostracized them in
[691.92 - 696.52] so many different ways they were jailed
[693.96 - 699.36] they were they were tortured I'm serious
[696.52 - 702.64] about that you don't know it I'm serious
[699.36 - 704.52] this was a bad time because it was
[702.64 - 707.08] Rising the alternative medicine was
[704.52 - 709.48] rising and that was really bad for
[707.08 - 711.00] business for conventional medicine but
[709.48 - 712.84] so what happened was conventional
[711.00 - 717.96] medicine pharmaceutical companies
[712.84 - 723.36] partnered with supplement makers bulk
[717.96 - 726.92] crappy supplements factorymade junk in
[723.36 - 728.92] massive amounts of bulk powders bulk
[726.92 - 732.36] everything and then it went into some of
[728.92 - 734.72] the old vitamins the just junky ones and
[732.36 - 737.32] they're in there today in the vitamins
[734.72 - 740.04] today in the conventional Market in the
[737.32 - 742.32] conventional in in the market I'm not
[740.04 - 743.24] going to mention names not going to
[742.32 - 747.32] mention
[743.24 - 749.84] names but we can do say use your
[747.32 - 752.64] imagination let me mention one
[749.84 - 755.76] um a vitamin called one a
[752.64 - 758.52] night or one a week maybe you could use
[755.76 - 760.52] your imagination classic a vitamin
[758.52 - 764.36] called
[760.52 - 767.72] um um let's see
[764.36 - 769.32] tum tum you could use your imagination
[767.72 - 772.24] you probably figured it out all right
[769.32 - 774.60] right this is just examples vitamins
[772.24 - 776.60] that back in the '90s early 90s cuz you
[774.60 - 779.20] couldn't get a vitamin back in the early
[776.60 - 781.92] 90s you go into the the pharmacy and
[779.20 - 785.32] they had two vitamins there and they
[781.92 - 787.48] were junk vitamins and they had dyes in
[785.32 - 789.60] them and they had red dye purple dye
[787.48 - 792.00] blue dye cancer-causing dyes God knows
[789.60 - 795.36] what all that you know that was in there
[792.00 - 797.20] they had all that in there but that
[795.36 - 798.72] those supplements aren't gone today
[797.20 - 799.76] they're there so when you look for a
[798.72 - 802.20] pre-
[799.76 - 805.52] needle you got to go back to the
[802.20 - 808.04] original to the original before the
[805.52 - 809.92] Vitamin World kind of lifted off the
[808.04 - 811.72] wrong way
[809.92 - 815.20] back in the 30s and turned into the 40s
[811.72 - 817.52] and 50s when you take a vitamin was that
[815.20 - 820.96] one kind of horse pill that was filled
[817.52 - 824.08] with lowgrade bulk junk from Factory
[820.96 - 825.76] Pharmacy Vitamin World okay that's what
[824.08 - 827.52] it was well you don't want to because
[825.76 - 829.52] well here's the deal prenatal are made
[827.52 - 831.56] out of that still made out not all of
[829.52 - 834.80] them but they're still made out made out
[831.56 - 836.88] of that they got fancier names now they
[834.80 - 837.76] get different brands now can get them
[836.88 - 840.04] doctor
[837.76 - 842.44] prescribed but they're
[840.04 - 843.88] junk do am I saying throwing them away
[842.44 - 846.08] no I'm saying you just have to be
[843.88 - 848.64] cautious to know that there's better
[846.08 - 851.56] ways I mean they may not hurt you they
[848.64 - 853.76] they may not hurt you they won't but
[851.56 - 855.84] there's better vitamins better pren

[855.84 - 861.52] know you
[857.68 - 864.68] know gourmet coffee right you want a cup
[861.52 - 867.96] of gourmet coffee do you want to go to a
[864.68 - 869.72] really good gourmet coffee place or do
[867.96 - 872.04] you want to go to a fast food restaurant
[869.72 - 873.92] that now has Gourmet Coffee which one
[872.04 - 876.20] would you which one would you rather go
[873.92 - 878.92] to the fast food restaurants which I
[876.20 - 880.96] won't name either which I won't name
[878.92 - 885.44] either the fast food
[880.96 - 888.80] restaurants okay they had coffee for
[885.44 - 892.72] decades right it was garbage everybody
[888.80 - 896.52] knew that come on everybody did it was a
[892.72 - 900.00] cup a small cup of crap is what it was
[896.52 - 902.96] and it tasted like you know roadkill and
[900.00 - 904.96] you know oil engine oil all right that
[902.96 - 907.48] was a cup of coffee you got that at the
[904.96 - 909.20] fast food restaurants if you wanted a
[907.48 - 911.08] real cup of coffee you had to go to a
[909.20 - 914.92] special place maybe a fancy place maybe
[911.08 - 917.40] some kind of eery maybe maybe to um you
[914.92 - 919.76] know not to the early diners the diners
[917.40 - 921.52] of today though have cormet coffees now
[919.76 - 924.08] but you go you know you get whatever it
[921.52 - 926.00] is you would go and and you would go
[924.08 - 927.80] looking forward it a nice Gourmet Coffee
[926.00 - 932.24] a better coffee a better get the whole
[927.80 - 933.92] bit you wouldn't want it at you know
[932.24 - 936.80] whatever place you wouldn't want it at
[933.92 - 940.16] that fast food place and but here's the
[936.80 - 941.56] deal here's the deal all right so I'm
[940.16 - 943.08] saying this gourmet coffee thing because
[941.56 - 945.68] there's a reason it's like that W
[943.08 - 947.20] supplements because now here's the deal
[945.68 - 949.08] those fast food places that had the
[947.20 - 952.56] worst cup of coffee and knew nothing
[949.08 - 953.96] about coffee possible possibly are toing
[952.56 - 955.48] that they got this SE and they got
[953.96 - 958.00] better coffees all these different fast
[955.48 - 959.40] food restaurants but why would I want to
[958.00 - 962.12] go there to get get the cup of coffee
[959.40 - 964.52] wouldn't I want to go to a to a place
[962.12 - 966.64] that knew about Gourmet Coffee long
[964.52 - 970.24] before someone tried to imitate it
[966.64 - 971.52] possibly yeah would you want supplements
[970.24 - 974.16] for
[971.52 - 977.04] pregnancy that are actually like whole
[974.16 - 982.20] food and really real to protect your
[977.04 - 984.00] baby and you instead of going with new
[982.20 - 986.08] you know I mean meaning like going with
[984.00 - 988.88] places that never knew about supplements
[986.08 - 991.64] to begin with what I'm trying to say is
[988.88 - 993.88] if you look at baby formulas and you see
[991.64 - 996.04] vitamins and minerals in baby formulas
[993.88 - 998.12] there's so many bad ones it's
[996.04 - 1000.68] unbelievable especially the old days the
[998.12 - 1003.64] canned baby formulas you got genetically
[1000.68 - 1006.24] altered soy oil you got corn tons of
[1003.64 - 1008.60] corn syrup corn syrup corn syrup you got
[1006.24 - 1010.72] all these bogus pharmaceutical bulk
[1008.60 - 1012.00] vitamins thrown in there and you see the
[1010.72 - 1015.48] list in there they'll have the whole
[1012.00 - 1017.36] list in there and and it it it really
[1015.48 - 1019.24] and this is from the makers that don't
[1017.36 - 1024.56] know anything about
[1019.24 - 1028.68] Gourmet Gourmet you know milk for babies
[1024.56 - 1030.76] Gourmet formulas that come from a mom
[1028.68 - 1033.12] what I'm trying to say is alternative
[1030.76 - 1035.76] medicine knew how to do it right from
[1033.12 - 1038.40] the beginning conventional medicine knew
[1035.76 - 1040.28] nothing about vitamins knew nothing
[1038.40 - 1044.08] about vitamins from the beginning and
[1040.28 - 1046.48] knew nothing really about baby Health as
[1044.08 - 1049.36] far as vitamins minerals and
[1046.48 - 1051.08] food now they know better better they're
[1049.36 - 1053.00] knowing better but that's like the fast
[1051.08 - 1055.64] food restaurant that just realized
[1053.00 - 1058.68] gourmet coffee is the way to go they
[1055.64 - 1060.92] didn't know about it for decades for
[1058.68 - 1063.20] decades they sold the worst coffee ever
[1060.92 - 1064.60] the conventional formulas meaning the
[1063.20 - 1067.16] then you got the conventional medicine
[1064.60 - 1070.20] selling the worst baby formulas ever on
[1067.16 - 1074.24] the planet you may as well sell them on
[1070.20 - 1076.28] mars or so they're so bad mean just ship
[1074.24 - 1077.92] them off to another planet actually
[1076.28 - 1081.72] don't even do that because I care about
[1077.92 - 1085.12] life on any plant the whole point
[1081.72 - 1087.20] is the whole point is is that you want
[1085.12 - 1090.04] to get down to the roots of the Whole
[1087.20 - 1092.12] Foods to the Natural formula to things
[1090.04 - 1094.04] meaning to the natural vitamins and
[1092.12 - 1095.84] minerals that are inside your own
[1094.04 - 1098.36] natural formula to breast milk and if
[1095.84 - 1101.80] you can't breastfeed then you want
[1098.36 - 1103.64] options you want options without a doubt
[1101.80 - 1105.76] but you don't want the worst baby
[1103.64 - 1108.64] formula that basically carries the
[1105.76 - 1111.04] pattern of the old day from the 1940s in
[1108.64 - 1115.68] the 1950s and the
[1111.04 - 1118.04] 1960s and even even just recently even
[1115.68 - 1119.56] recently and don't get me wrong you know
[1118.04 - 1121.24] conventional medicine is great for so
[1119.56 - 1123.32] many things I'm ripping into them a
[1121.24 - 1125.08] little bit today but that's because they
[1123.32 - 1127.56] didn't know anything about
[1125.08 - 1130.20] vitamins or what mommy should be taking
[1127.56 - 1132.40] or doing but now they seem to be experts
[1130.20 - 1134.00] recently and then you get a mix you get
[1132.40 - 1135.80] these doctors that were all conventional
[1134.00 - 1138.44] and then yeah they want to learn more
[1135.80 - 1140.28] more alternatively and that's thank God
[1138.44 - 1142.04] God for that that's that's the
[1140.28 - 1144.16] difference today that makes a difference
[1142.04 - 1146.24] that makes it so much better and that
[1144.16 - 1149.88] part I totally
[1146.24 - 1153.44] treasure but you know we the whole point
[1149.88 - 1157.08] is you want to get either way you don't
[1153.44 - 1159.48] want you don't want the stuff that came
[1157.08 - 1162.00] from the fast food restaurant a long
[1159.48 - 1164.56] time ago and then get the good stuff
[1162.00 - 1166.72] from that fast food restaurant because
[1164.56 - 1169.76] there's always some loophole that isn't
[1166.72 - 1173.24] good in the end what I'm saying is you
[1169.76 - 1175.56] don't want that classic prenatal that's
[1173.24 - 1178.52] filled the junky bulk vitamins that have
[1175.56 - 1181.20] been in stock at factories overproduced
[1178.52 - 1183.52] for 20 30 years and then literally
[1181.20 - 1185.84] thrown into supplements today did you
[1183.52 - 1190.44] know the conventional
[1185.84 - 1192.12] vitamins they have a stock going but
[1190.44 - 1196.52] back
[1192.12 - 1198.64] decades sitting in warehouses that end
[1196.52 - 1200.64] up going fresh as if they were fresh
[1198.64 - 1202.84] into supplements that go on the market
[1200.64 - 1204.80] as of 6 months ago then the expir then
[1202.84 - 1206.72] the expiration date goes on that vitamin
[1204.80 - 1209.76] then it goes on it doesn't go on is it's
[1206.72 - 1211.00] sitting in factories in piles and piles
[1209.76 - 1214.56] and
[1211.00 - 1217.32] piles sitting in factories and and
[1214.56 - 1219.04] seriously in mounds of this stuff
[1217.32 - 1220.84] because they have a backlog why do they
[1219.04 - 1223.84] have a backlog because it was
[1220.84 - 1225.92] financially smart at the time it was
[1223.84 - 1228.40] good for tax reasons good for all kinds
[1225.92 - 1232.40] of corporate reasons pile the stuff up
[1228.40 - 1235.36] till the cows came home and then use it
[1232.40 - 1237.08] later and that's what's in prenatals
[1235.36 - 1238.68] today you have to be careful you have to
[1237.08 - 1240.36] get the right prenatal the ones that
[1238.68 - 1242.88] don't have that the ones that have Whole
[1240.36 - 1245.16] Foods the ones that could protect you
[1242.88 - 1246.84] you don't want your prenatal from that
[1245.16 - 1248.80] fast food restaurant that just kind of
[1246.84 - 1250.80] learned about it now either and all of a
[1248.80 - 1252.96] sudden they learned about it now great
[1250.80 - 1256.12] you want your prenatal from the people
[1252.96 - 1260.20] that originated originally knowing what
[1256.12 - 1263.84] really was right all long as far as the
[1260.20 - 1268.28] concept of whole whole food whole
[1263.84 - 1270.36] vitamins Whole Food real food that was
[1268.28 - 1274.52] the concept at the beginning and then it
[1270.36 - 1276.08] totally totally got ripped apart and ex
[1274.52 - 1279.24] and and thrown in 20 different
[1276.08 - 1281.32] directions along the way so yeah you
[1279.24 - 1282.84] want Gourmet Coffee you go to a gourmet
[1281.32 - 1284.88] place because you're going to trust that
[1282.84 - 1286.12] they really are experts in it you go to
[1284.88 - 1287.84] a fast food restaurant ohoo they're
[1286.12 - 1289.96] serving gourmet coffee now but what did
[1287.84 - 1291.68] they serve people for 40 years in their
[1289.96 - 1293.64] in their chain
[1291.68 - 1297.16] garbage
[1293.64 - 1298.84] garbage look the bottom line is I just
[1297.16 - 1300.08] want to make sure that you know you're
[1298.84 - 1302.64] on the right
[1300.08 - 1304.00] supplements so let's talk about prenal I
[1302.64 - 1306.16] can't help it because it's such a good
[1304.00 - 1308.20] one to talk about first of all prenatal
[1306.16 - 1310.84] vitamins aren't really ideal you can
[1308.20 - 1313.08] take them fine that's good but they're
[1310.84 - 1314.24] they're put together with the thought of
[1313.08 - 1318.28] what Mommy
[1314.24 - 1323.00] needs the thought of what Mommy needs
[1318.28 - 1326.00] for their baby okay number one and that
[1323.00 - 1328.48] was on Old standards old standards of
[1326.00 - 1331.52] blood work from from years ago from
[1328.48 - 1334.00] years ago What alternative medicine has
[1331.52 - 1336.32] done unfortunately this is one thing
[1334.00 - 1339.20] they've done that's not good is they've
[1336.32 - 1341.32] taken they've gone by the standard of
[1339.20 - 1344.52] what conventional medicine already
[1341.32 - 1347.28] created for what mommy and baby needs
[1344.52 - 1348.84] they've gone on that standard so that
[1347.28 - 1350.28] means it's what how many different
[1348.84 - 1353.64] vitamins and minerals that are in there
[1350.28 - 1356.24] which ones they choose the whole bit are
[1353.64 - 1359.16] chosen off of the
[1356.24 - 1361.76] standard that was created a long time
[1359.16 - 1363.24] ago so you're telling me the standard in
[1361.76 - 1365.96] conventional medicine that was created a
[1363.24 - 1368.00] long time ago that holds true has it
[1365.96 - 1371.64] held true in any part of conventional
[1368.00 - 1373.96] medicine not really not really it hasn't
[1371.64 - 1376.36] because we figured that oh no this drug
[1373.96 - 1378.12] is bad oh no that drug is bad oh no 20
[1376.36 - 1381.08] years later oh this drug is bad got to
[1378.12 - 1382.72] create a new one oh um this this this
[1381.08 - 1385.04] surgery is bad no we got to do it a
[1382.72 - 1386.80] different way a new way oh this is bad
[1385.04 - 1390.16] um this technique is bad got to do it a
[1386.80 - 1392.24] different way um is salt good for you
[1390.16 - 1394.72] when you're when you're you know out in
[1392.24 - 1396.12] Sun is it bad for you um too much water
[1394.72 - 1397.60] when you're dehydrated good for you bad
[1396.12 - 1399.48] for you it's constantly going back and
[1397.60 - 1401.08] forth conventional medicine doesn't know
[1399.48 - 1403.88] where they're going with all that there
[1401.08 - 1406.16] there up and down left and right but
[1403.88 - 1408.80] their old standard of of what mommy
[1406.16 - 1411.04] needed in 1950 in the first prenatals or
[1408.80 - 1413.32] whatever it was around that time I mean
[1411.04 - 1416.60] why did alternative medicine just adopt
[1413.32 - 1418.16] that they adopted that why from what I
[1416.60 - 1419.64] said at the very beginning of the show
[1418.16 - 1420.96] there was interest groups all the way at
[1419.64 - 1422.60] the very back of the beginning of the
[1420.96 - 1424.32] first bits of information alternate
[1422.60 - 1426.16] medicine just you know pulled in that
[1424.32 - 1427.92] old information and just started using
[1426.16 - 1428.88] it but it's contaminated information
[1427.92 - 1432.04] once
[1428.88 - 1433.96] again and so what does this mean this
[1432.04 - 1436.40] means that you can make your own
[1433.96 - 1438.64] prenatal with using the right stuff that
[1436.40 - 1441.76] outbeat prenatals
[1438.64 - 1445.36] spirina alone has more for you and your
[1441.76 - 1446.76] baby than any pill horse pill with a
[1445.36 - 1448.00] little bit of this and a little bit of
[1446.76 - 1451.08] that and a little bit of this and a
[1448.00 - 1453.92] little bit of that in the pharmacy the
[1451.08 - 1457.00] prenatals or a prescription prenatal it
[1453.92 - 1461.32] can't touch what a teaspoon of sparina
[1457.00 - 1462.80] can do with helping your baby that blue
[1461.32 - 1466.16] green
[1462.80 - 1469.36] color in there it's a
[1466.16 - 1471.92] miracle what that can do for your baby
[1469.36 - 1474.12] and development for brain and everything
[1471.92 - 1477.12] I mean literally a little a big horse
[1474.12 - 1479.44] pill with nothing with fillers in it big
[1477.12 - 1481.60] horse pillar with fillers in it you know
[1479.44 - 1486.84] prescrib the prenatal with some because
[1481.60 - 1488.56] some guy some some guy back in 1948 said
[1486.84 - 1490.84] women need this these are the minerals
[1488.56 - 1494.28] and vitamins they need for when they're
[1490.84 - 1494.28] pregnant and then that carried
[1494.92 - 1498.28] on I'm
[1496.76 - 1500.44] serious
[1498.28 - 1502.12] and um and so here's the deal you can
[1500.44 - 1504.56] make your own prenal natal too or you
[1502.12 - 1508.20] can add to it like I said a little
[1504.56 - 1510.00] spirulina that's a great one because
[1508.20 - 1510.72] what that has as far as from vitamins
[1510.00 - 1513.80] and
[1510.72 - 1515.28] minerals is is is much more advanced as
[1513.80 - 1518.08] far as in the form they're in they're
[1515.28 - 1520.04] the bioactive and bioavailable form I
[1518.08 - 1521.52] don't like Corella Corella because
[1520.04 - 1525.84] Corella here's what Corella doeses
[1521.52 - 1528.24] Corella what it does is it it takes
[1525.84 - 1529.60] heavy metal and it drops it it takes
[1528.24 - 1531.48] heavy metal and it drops it and
[1529.60 - 1533.36] protecting the baby and protecting mom
[1531.48 - 1536.76] one way of protecting baby protecting
[1533.36 - 1539.56] mom is making sure toxic heavy metals
[1536.76 - 1541.28] are not in the program whatever you do
[1539.56 - 1543.76] that are not in the program and if there
[1541.28 - 1545.88] is toxic heavy metals that are in the
[1543.76 - 1547.48] body in mom's mom's body because she's
[1545.88 - 1550.60] going to have them that's just the way
[1547.48 - 1552.64] it works now she's going to have them
[1550.60 - 1555.52] and and that means the baby could have
[1552.64 - 1558.12] some and you don't want to use Corella
[1555.52 - 1560.80] cuz Corella if it even extracts heavy
[1558.12 - 1563.84] metal from Mommy from mommy's
[1560.80 - 1567.00] brain or from mommy's liver it's going
[1563.84 - 1570.60] to drop it right away it's irresponsible
[1567.00 - 1572.48] meaning this Corella itself is like that
[1570.60 - 1575.80] football player on the field that you
[1572.48 - 1577.48] just can't trust or that hockey player
[1575.80 - 1580.24] you can't just trust and pack the puck
[1577.48 - 1582.80] to you can't you can't trust that one
[1580.24 - 1584.88] because it's always always goes
[1582.80 - 1586.52] wrong it's the same thing with Kow
[1584.88 - 1588.24] because the toxic Heavy Metal the
[1586.52 - 1591.04] Mercury's going to get dropped along the
[1588.24 - 1593.84] way and anybody who totes cor like the
[1591.04 - 1595.28] god you I still see it today I can't
[1593.84 - 1597.68] even believe it after I talked about it
[1595.28 - 1599.28] medical medium book one and I talk about
[1597.68 - 1601.72] it all the time and I I I put
[1599.28 - 1604.76] information out there I still see people
[1601.72 - 1608.24] like oh carella he not spirina carella
[1604.76 - 1610.52] carella is the one no it's not it's not
[1608.24 - 1612.56] it just doesn't work I'm sorry it's got
[1610.52 - 1614.36] nutrition in it but it doesn't work for
[1612.56 - 1617.64] for heavy metals so what I'm saying is
[1614.36 - 1619.24] sparina can take metal out of the body
[1617.64 - 1623.28] and not let it
[1619.24 - 1626.08] go and not let it go hence not let it go
[1623.28 - 1628.16] and get to your baby somehow not let it
[1626.08 - 1631.40] go and get to your baby somehow but
[1628.16 - 1633.04] instead fortify your baby with
[1631.40 - 1634.80] unbelievable
[1633.04 - 1637.56] micronutrients what do you think makes
[1634.80 - 1641.48] that color that color sure Corella has a
[1637.56 - 1643.88] good color too without a doubt but but
[1641.48 - 1646.00] like I said it's not the same thing and
[1643.88 - 1648.64] it's not as nutritious anyway as
[1646.00 - 1650.92] spirulina what makes that color you know
[1648.64 - 1653.36] what makes that color a force that's
[1650.92 - 1655.72] beyond all of us a force that's up in
[1653.36 - 1658.76] the up in heaven a
[1655.72 - 1661.08] force okay way up there a spiritual
[1658.76 - 1663.36] power so whatever your belief system is
[1661.08 - 1665.76] and I I I treasure everybody's belief
[1663.36 - 1668.04] system whether you believe a light is up
[1665.76 - 1669.40] there a Creator you you don't believe in
[1668.04 - 1671.44] God you don't believe you believe in
[1669.40 - 1674.16] something else you believe that we just
[1671.44 - 1676.52] we just derived out of a lake and as the
[1674.16 - 1678.72] as the centuries as as the thousands of
[1676.52 - 1680.24] years pass and millions of years past we
[1678.72 - 1683.16] grew into something else whatever you
[1680.24 - 1684.56] believe in I respect it and I honor it
[1683.16 - 1687.84] no matter what it
[1684.56 - 1690.00] is and so whatever you believe in fine
[1687.84 - 1692.76] but believe that that's what's
[1690.00 - 1694.68] responsible for spirina that color in
[1692.76 - 1697.44] spirina that's what's responsible for
[1694.68 - 1700.00] that color and that color is using the
[1697.44 - 1702.48] word magical completely insults that
[1700.00 - 1705.84] color it's it's it's it's bigger than
[1702.48 - 1708.64] that so it's a great food teaspoon of
[1705.84 - 1713.16] Spirulina can do more than
[1708.64 - 1715.36] 99.9% of all of of all prenatals out
[1713.16 - 1718.40] there for a mommy and
[1715.36 - 1721.56] baby and maybe even
[1718.40 - 1723.40] 100% but that's one thing that's really
[1721.56 - 1725.80] good you another thing that's really
[1723.40 - 1727.96] good is barleygrass juice powder
[1725.80 - 1731.16] barleygrass juice powder it's another
[1727.96 - 1733.76] one that's a great one that's a great
[1731.16 - 1737.12] one it has power to it similar to
[1733.76 - 1739.40] spirina but Power because because it's
[1737.12 - 1742.08] not just the nutrient profile the the
[1739.40 - 1744.96] the microminerals subclasses that aren't
[1742.08 - 1746.96] even studied subclasses of minerals and
[1744.96 - 1748.52] and vitamins and amino acids that aren't
[1746.96 - 1750.56] even disc you know people think all the
[1748.52 - 1752.64] amino acids are discovered they think
[1750.56 - 1754.48] they're all discovered as if as if
[1752.64 - 1755.88] science dedicated it all science puts
[1754.48 - 1758.56] trillions of dollars into genes that's
[1755.88 - 1760.48] all they care about it's not it's not
[1758.56 - 1762.68] what's in barley grass juice powder and
[1760.48 - 1765.04] what amino acids are not discovered in
[1762.68 - 1766.52] them trust me who's going to waste their
[1765.04 - 1768.16] time and money and interest groups are
[1766.52 - 1772.32] going to waste all their time money into
[1768.16 - 1774.16] that endeavor no one exactly but
[1772.32 - 1779.08] undiscovered amino acids are critical
[1774.16 - 1781.96] for baby Health baby growth for mommy's
[1779.08 - 1786.36] health during pregnancy teaspoon of
[1781.96 - 1791.52] barley grass juice powder does more than
[1786.36 - 1792.96] any any any prenatal does more than that
[1791.52 - 1796.28] and then you do you know teaspoon of
[1792.96 - 1799.20] Spirulina teaspoon of barley grass juice
[1796.28 - 1800.96] powder you can do a half a teaspoon if
[1799.20 - 1803.56] you're nervous about do a quarter
[1800.96 - 1805.48] teaspoon because it's that incredible
[1803.56 - 1807.48] for you it's that incredible for you
[1805.48 - 1809.56] could do A4 teaspoon some other
[1807.48 - 1812.76] supplements I like I like
[1809.56 - 1815.44] methylfolate moms have a hard time have
[1812.76 - 1818.52] a hard time methylating liver the liver
[1815.44 - 1821.52] goes under a lot of pressure a lot of a
[1818.52 - 1824.76] lot of of strain and stress so
[1821.52 - 1827.56] methylfolate is critical cuz it's it's
[1824.76 - 1830.64] about getting that methylation even
[1827.56 - 1833.48] better than it can be the
[1830.64 - 1835.28] conversion of nutrients into other
[1833.48 - 1838.20] nutrients that can't be studied by
[1835.28 - 1839.76] research in science it can't be and what
[1838.20 - 1841.40] happens when it enters the stomach and
[1839.76 - 1842.96] goes everywhere through the body it'll
[1841.40 - 1845.24] never get discovered by research and
[1842.96 - 1847.32] science I mean we're talking 500 years
[1845.24 - 1849.68] from now if the world doesn't blow
[1847.32 - 1853.76] itself up 500 years from
[1849.68 - 1855.88] now and anything is is is that's that's
[1853.76 - 1858.44] what the whole point is is about that
[1855.88 - 1860.16] that conversion it's about converting
[1858.44 - 1862.36] inside the body converting everything
[1860.16 - 1864.84] converting when pregnant and
[1862.36 - 1866.92] pre-pregnant it's all about conversion
[1864.84 - 1869.12] conversion meaning your liver does these
[1866.92 - 1870.92] magical things converts this into that
[1869.12 - 1872.72] converts this into that takes every
[1870.92 - 1874.96] micronutrient moves it into something
[1872.72 - 1876.40] else tags it with hormones that are
[1874.96 - 1878.00] undiscovered by research and science
[1876.40 - 1881.04] that bind on to it and drive it through
[1878.00 - 1882.48] the body so methylfolate helps to
[1881.04 - 1884.84] improve
[1882.48 - 1887.28] methylation and I like that one there's
[1884.84 - 1889.32] the 1 mgram capsule could take it once
[1887.28 - 1892.04] in a while you could take it um talk to
[1889.32 - 1894.52] your professional about it talk to your
[1892.04 - 1896.92] doctor about it bring all this to your
[1894.52 - 1898.56] to your to your doc and you're pregnant
[1896.92 - 1901.20] bring it all to your doc you know let
[1898.56 - 1903.96] your doc nay or yay whatever I totally
[1901.20 - 1907.36] totally respect that without a doubt
[1903.96 - 1909.96] 100% but methylfolate is really helpful
[1907.36 - 1912.24] helps the liver it does and that's a
[1909.96 - 1914.68] great thing it's not there to detox the
[1912.24 - 1916.44] liver cuz you don't want to detox the
[1914.68 - 1918.80] liver of years and years of garbage
[1916.44 - 1919.80] sitting inside of it while pregnant you
[1918.80 - 1922.96] don't want to do that you don't want to
[1919.80 - 1925.08] do a heavy detox don't do anything crazy
[1922.96 - 1927.36] don't do one of those you know cleanses
[1925.08 - 1928.72] clean cleanse not like a food cleanse
[1927.36 - 1930.32] but some kind of liquid cleanse where
[1928.72 - 1931.44] it's just liquid only for long term
[1930.32 - 1933.32] while you're pregnant don't ever do
[1931.44 - 1938.28] anything like that I think you I think
[1933.32 - 1940.12] you know that um but the bottom line is
[1938.28 - 1942.84] these are some of the things to use
[1940.12 - 1945.08] iodine a little bit of nent
[1942.84 - 1946.32] iodine now you can talk to your
[1945.08 - 1948.08] practitioner about that too a little bit
[1946.32 - 1950.72] of nent iodine
[1948.08 - 1954.08] um one tiny drop every now and then if
[1950.72 - 1956.96] you want right on the tongue you can do
[1954.08 - 1959.04] that that's something also that is is
[1956.96 - 1962.04] helpful why is that helpful because
[1959.04 - 1963.24] iodine deficiencies cause immune
[1962.04 - 1966.92] function
[1963.24 - 1969.84] problems within not only Mommy's body
[1966.92 - 1971.68] but baby's body so now if you don't want
[1969.84 - 1973.24] to do a little bit of n iodine and you
[1971.68 - 1974.80] don't have to you can talk to your you
[1973.24 - 1977.80] can do something else maybe take a strip
[1974.80 - 1980.48] of dolls eat a strip of dolls
[1977.80 - 1982.12] that's that Atlantic Sea vegetable just
[1980.48 - 1985.00] eat one strip once in a while you get
[1982.12 - 1987.36] nice little iodine kick from that that's
[1985.00 - 1990.92] really good so that's something you can
[1987.36 - 1994.24] do and you know food doesn't have iodine
[1990.92 - 1997.44] in it even food organically grown is
[1994.24 - 2000.48] still lacking iodine those fields see
[1997.44 - 2002.28] the organic fields are over
[2000.48 - 2005.52] overproduced thank God they are they
[2002.28 - 2007.64] give us great food but overproduced
[2005.52 - 2009.48] overproduced and I'm saying that because
[2007.64 - 2012.60] the fields go
[2009.48 - 2014.36] Barren why am I saying Barren because
[2012.60 - 2016.04] when you're pregnant you're not Barren
[2014.36 - 2017.12] you know what I mean it what women worry
[2016.04 - 2018.60] about when they can't get pregnant
[2017.12 - 2020.80] they're worrying about that whole bar
[2018.60 - 2022.32] being Barren or something and there's
[2020.80 - 2023.60] ways to get pregnant there's ways of
[2022.32 - 2025.52] having a baby and there's ways of
[2023.60 - 2027.76] fighting and fighting through that and
[2025.52 - 2030.28] surviving through that and and having b
[2027.76 - 2032.68] a baby and giving birth to a baby but
[2030.28 - 2035.68] what that means is it's like it's like
[2032.68 - 2037.76] we want to put something back into that
[2035.68 - 2041.72] soil and that's that's what some organic
[2037.76 - 2044.68] farms do they put back into their soil
[2041.72 - 2046.08] back into there and they try to get
[2044.68 - 2047.60] things back and you know what one thing
[2046.08 - 2049.40] they put back into I'm talking about
[2047.60 - 2052.24] this CU it's so important I know this
[2049.40 - 2055.60] one Farm you know what they put in their
[2052.24 - 2058.08] fields this organic they're not putting
[2055.60 - 2060.04] manure and a lot of organic Fields put
[2058.08 - 2061.92] manure they're not putting or you know
[2060.04 - 2065.52] manure anything what are they putting
[2061.92 - 2069.96] they're putting seaweed tons and tons of
[2065.52 - 2073.84] seaweed like tons of it what I mean tons
[2069.96 - 2076.76] truckloads of seaweed they dump into
[2073.84 - 2078.60] their fields till it in they till it in
[2076.76 - 2082.04] they let it sit for a year without using
[2078.60 - 2086.00] the field so that the snow comes and the
[2082.04 - 2088.04] rain comes and it brings all these other
[2086.00 - 2090.36] micronutrients and it mixes with the
[2088.04 - 2094.44] seaweed makes these living chemical
[2090.36 - 2096.20] compounds making living living soil and
[2094.44 - 2097.84] they do that and the iodine goes up in
[2096.20 - 2099.52] the soil
[2097.84 - 2101.08] and that's really amazing but we can't
[2099.52 - 2103.40] always rely on what farm is that what
[2101.08 - 2105.36] farm is that nobody knows right nobody
[2103.40 - 2107.88] can just eat at one Farm oh let me
[2105.36 - 2109.28] that's that farm across five states away
[2107.88 - 2113.00] let me go see if I can get some fresh
[2109.28 - 2115.04] spinach from them here's the deal so you
[2113.00 - 2117.16] want maybe a little strip of of dolls
[2115.04 - 2120.32] would be okay that's all you don't need
[2117.16 - 2122.80] a lot of it Atlantic Sea Coast that kind
[2120.32 - 2124.92] I really like that's something that's
[2122.80 - 2127.96] powerful supplement
[2124.92 - 2129.68] wise now vitamin D
[2127.96 - 2132.20] vitamin D is a big one on the list
[2129.68 - 2136.40] meaning like um doctors are offering
[2132.20 - 2138.84] that I'm not a big vitamin D fan because
[2136.40 - 2141.28] vitamin D uh does a couple things first
[2138.84 - 2144.00] of all it thins out the blood and when
[2141.28 - 2146.12] you're pregnant you know I don't like a
[2144.00 - 2148.40] lot of vitamin D I it's because you
[2146.12 - 2151.20] don't want to thin out the
[2148.40 - 2152.36] blood too bad when you're pregnant you
[2151.20 - 2154.20] don't want to do that mean you don't
[2152.36 - 2155.96] want to go you got to be very careful so
[2154.20 - 2158.48] what happens is you got to I've seen
[2155.96 - 2160.88] some women they're on lots of vitamin D
[2158.48 - 2162.24] before pregnancy or maybe over the last
[2160.88 - 2164.76] couple years meaning over the couple
[2162.24 - 2166.56] years before becoming pregnant and you
[2164.76 - 2167.76] know vitamin D3 is the way to go by the
[2166.56 - 2169.68] way if you're going to do vitamin D
[2167.76 - 2171.76] vitamin D3 I was talking about that a
[2169.68 - 2176.12] long time ago when everybody wasn't
[2171.76 - 2177.76] using that one so vitamin D3 and what
[2176.12 - 2179.36] happens is that people go on the Habit
[2177.76 - 2180.60] they go on the kick they brainwashed
[2179.36 - 2183.60] vitamin D you need Vitamin D the
[2180.60 - 2187.40] brainwashed vitamin D vitamin D vitamin
[2183.60 - 2188.96] D is just one thing that you we can even
[2187.40 - 2190.28] get from the sun the sun gives us so
[2188.96 - 2191.72] many more important things that isn't
[2190.28 - 2193.68] even on the list because science
[2191.72 - 2197.88] research hasn't discovered it just got
[2193.68 - 2199.12] to understand that um but vitamin D the
[2197.88 - 2200.84] problem is with that we get so
[2199.12 - 2202.56] brainwashed into Vitamin D thinking this
[2200.84 - 2204.28] is this is like the greatest thing on
[2202.56 - 2207.80] the planet that we
[2204.28 - 2209.56] need and we get into a habit of taking
[2207.80 - 2213.76] it and then we get pregnant and we take
[2209.56 - 2216.44] a lot of it not good at all not good at
[2213.76 - 2219.12] all just going to say it right now too
[2216.44 - 2221.28] much vitamin D thins out the blood you
[2219.12 - 2223.84] don't want to thin out the blood while
[2221.28 - 2225.36] pregnant or even pre-pregnant meaning
[2223.84 - 2227.48] pre- pregancy trying to you you're
[2225.36 - 2229.04] working to try to get pregnant you got
[2227.48 - 2230.36] to be careful with that that's what
[2229.04 - 2232.96] that's what I mean but if it's there's a
[2230.36 - 2234.80] little bit in something a little bit in
[2232.96 - 2238.16] a good prenatal uh
[2234.80 - 2240.24] fine but I wouldn't go out of your way
[2238.16 - 2242.04] and taking a lot of it get the smallest
[2240.24 - 2244.64] dose maybe get the drops the liquid
[2242.04 - 2247.28] drops or get a really small amount of
[2244.64 - 2249.64] IUS if you want to take it I'm just
[2247.28 - 2251.92] giving you advice on you know taking
[2249.64 - 2255.12] vitamin D very important so that's
[2251.92 - 2258.48] something I wanted to kind of um talk
[2255.12 - 2260.84] about you got to see the world doesn't
[2258.48 - 2262.88] agree upon one thing you you know that
[2260.84 - 2266.84] right like the whole world doesn't agree
[2262.88 - 2268.88] about one thing right right no no
[2266.84 - 2270.28] complete diversity in the world
[2268.88 - 2272.48] everybody agrees on different things
[2270.28 - 2274.20] that's the way it should be that's the
[2272.48 - 2276.36] way it should be you know everybody's
[2274.20 - 2278.04] got their own own beliefs and everything
[2276.36 - 2280.88] else and you name it it goes list goes
[2278.04 - 2283.04] on like No One Believes In thinking this
[2280.88 - 2285.20] this one car is the best car and
[2283.04 - 2286.68] everybody should be driving it right do
[2285.20 - 2289.28] you think everybody should be driving
[2286.68 - 2290.84] the same car so just think globally
[2289.28 - 2292.28] think about everybody in the us alone
[2290.84 - 2294.36] should they all be driving down the same
[2292.28 - 2297.20] the same car can you imagine everybody's
[2294.36 - 2299.96] driving the same car so every single
[2297.20 - 2301.64] couple and family and every single
[2299.96 - 2303.84] boyfriend and girlfriend and every
[2301.64 - 2306.76] single single person and every single
[2303.84 - 2308.44] friend believes this one car is the car
[2306.76 - 2309.84] to drive so everybody's driving it you
[2308.44 - 2311.76] wouldn't see that right just like you
[2309.84 - 2313.68] wouldn't see everybody agrees on this
[2311.76 - 2315.40] one cup of coffee and don't drink coffee
[2313.68 - 2316.84] while you're pregnant whatever you do
[2315.40 - 2318.96] and you know what I mean like not
[2316.84 - 2319.92] everybody agrees in the same brand right
[2318.96 - 2323.40] on the
[2319.92 - 2324.32] planet but what you will and not not
[2323.40 - 2326.48] everybody believes you should be
[2324.32 - 2328.52] drinking coffee on the planet but what
[2326.48 - 2330.00] you'll see about vitamin D is the whole
[2328.52 - 2331.88] planet right now believes you should be
[2330.00 - 2333.28] taking it that you should be on it that
[2331.88 - 2334.44] no matter what that's the most important
[2333.28 - 2336.68] supplement that that's what you should
[2334.44 - 2339.32] be on the whole planet the whole planet
[2336.68 - 2341.12] it there's something wrong with that I'm
[2339.32 - 2344.92] just being straightforward there's
[2341.12 - 2348.48] something terribly terribly wrong with
[2344.92 - 2351.16] that I'm just saying the vitamin D3 is
[2348.48 - 2354.04] not the uh worst thing in the world it's
[2351.16 - 2355.92] not the best thing in the world do you
[2354.04 - 2358.16] need it all the time not
[2355.92 - 2362.32] necessarily not necessarily does it
[2358.16 - 2364.08] offer a lot not a lot not a lot I'm not
[2362.32 - 2366.48] anti-d I'm just saying when the whole
[2364.08 - 2367.36] world believes in one thing and one
[2366.48 - 2370.08] thing
[2367.36 - 2371.60] only there was a reason for that going
[2370.08 - 2373.84] all the way back at the beginning of
[2371.60 - 2375.60] wherever that started just look out look
[2373.84 - 2377.28] out so just be careful don't be taking
[2375.60 - 2381.16] tons and tons of it don't be taking
[2377.28 - 2382.68] 50,000 I use you know be careful if you
[2381.16 - 2385.04] if you're if your practitioner want you
[2382.68 - 2388.32] on it then then yeah but just be careful
[2385.04 - 2390.72] on how much you take and take breaks
[2388.32 - 2392.40] take breaks so that's something I want
[2390.72 - 2395.16] to come across so here's the deal Foods
[2392.40 - 2397.56] I want to cover some foods foods are
[2395.16 - 2400.08] important now
[2397.56 - 2401.88] it it when it comes down to pregnancy
[2400.08 - 2404.68] you want to you want to be careful now
[2401.88 - 2406.84] the word protein is rampant out there
[2404.68 - 2408.60] protein protein protein protein it's all
[2406.84 - 2411.52] about protein all about protein protein
[2408.60 - 2414.64] doesn't make babies protein doesn't make
[2411.52 - 2417.20] babies if that was the key if that was
[2414.64 - 2419.40] if that was the the truth then breast
[2417.20 - 2421.92] milk would be all protein it would be
[2419.40 - 2424.08] all protein breast milk has minute
[2421.92 - 2427.76] amount of protein and every woman is
[2424.08 - 2432.12] different every woman is different
[2427.76 - 2436.08] some women have 1.5% protein in their
[2432.12 - 2438.44] breast milk some women have literally
[2436.08 - 2441.64] .9% and their healthy women and they're
[2438.44 - 2442.48] eating plenty of protein some women have
[2441.64 - 2445.32] um
[2442.48 - 2448.80] 2.5 some people have
[2445.32 - 2451.96] 3% but that's pretty much Max and that's
[2448.80 - 2454.68] in breast milk that's in breast milk
[2451.96 - 2456.12] okay why if it was the most important
[2454.68 - 2458.24] thing in the world for pregnancies and
[2456.12 - 2460.32] for babies after birth it was the most
[2458.24 - 2462.96] important thing in the world why
[2460.32 - 2464.96] wouldn't there be more protein in
[2462.96 - 2467.68] mother's milk which
[2464.96 - 2469.28] is holy
[2467.68 - 2472.84] milk
[2469.28 - 2476.16] well okay are we going to doubt or judge
[2472.84 - 2479.08] nature are we going to doubt and judge
[2476.16 - 2480.68] nature no not in this situation are we
[2479.08 - 2483.00] going to doubt mom's
[2480.68 - 2486.68] body are we going to do that are we
[2483.00 - 2489.52] going to doubt our you know the mother's
[2486.68 - 2492.16] body are we going to do that but yeah we
[2489.52 - 2494.08] do we do doubt that so so what happen we
[2492.16 - 2496.52] shouldn't so what happens women are
[2494.08 - 2498.04] eating protein protein protein and what
[2496.52 - 2500.56] is what does too much protein do it
[2498.04 - 2503.28] starves the baby because what does the
[2500.56 - 2506.40] baby feed on for
[2503.28 - 2508.00] development baby feeds on sugar yeah
[2506.40 - 2510.68] shocker shocker I talked a little bit
[2508.00 - 2513.16] about this in the last show too shocker
[2510.68 - 2514.92] that's a big I know right surprise
[2513.16 - 2516.72] that's why breast milk is sugar water I
[2514.92 - 2517.80] Ted about the L I know I just can't help
[2516.72 - 2520.52] it but I got to talk about it more in
[2517.80 - 2523.28] depth it's sugar water you have to
[2520.52 - 2526.24] understand that with lowfat it's lowfat
[2523.28 - 2529.48] sugar water that's what it is
[2526.24 - 2532.72] interesting very interesting CU glucose
[2529.48 - 2535.72] is what develops a baby underweight
[2532.72 - 2539.04] babies occur and mommies underweight
[2535.72 - 2541.72] babies occur from high fat high protein
[2539.04 - 2544.16] diets and not enough
[2541.72 - 2546.28] carbohydrate that's what occurs I'm
[2544.16 - 2548.52] seeing it in the latest I'm seeing it in
[2546.28 - 2550.68] women lately because they've adopted the
[2548.52 - 2553.12] high fat high protein Trend with no
[2550.68 - 2555.48] carbohydrates and they they stuck to it
[2553.12 - 2557.96] versus craving versus falling for their
[2555.48 - 2560.60] Cravings meaning saying oh no I better
[2557.96 - 2564.28] not have that half a potato oh no I
[2560.60 - 2566.16] better not have I better not have um you
[2564.28 - 2569.64] know that little bit of hummus oh wait a
[2566.16 - 2571.72] minute I better not have um too much
[2569.64 - 2573.56] avocado because avocado's got a little
[2571.72 - 2576.32] fat in it but it's got more sugar in it
[2573.56 - 2578.72] okay I better not oh it's a fruit okay
[2576.32 - 2580.92] so I better not have that fruit I better
[2578.72 - 2582.52] not have that banana I better not have
[2580.92 - 2583.88] any of that I better not have you know
[2582.52 - 2585.44] that winter squash it's too many
[2583.88 - 2587.72] calories too
[2585.44 - 2589.12] starchy and and they and and they get
[2587.72 - 2591.44] scared because they're trained through
[2589.12 - 2593.80] the trend the trendy trap of high
[2591.44 - 2595.44] protein high fat sure if you're not
[2593.80 - 2597.72] pregnant and if you're a guy listening
[2595.44 - 2599.64] to this you're not going to get pregnant
[2597.72 - 2602.08] you want your high fat High trendy diet
[2599.64 - 2604.88] I'm not go ahead if you if it's you feel
[2602.08 - 2606.64] like it's doing you good I I'm fine
[2604.88 - 2609.52] because it's not about that it's about
[2606.64 - 2611.24] mommy and baby and what they need that's
[2609.52 - 2613.04] what it's about it's not about what
[2611.24 - 2614.48] Anthony William likes or Anthony William
[2613.04 - 2617.52] loves or Anthony William believes and
[2614.48 - 2620.64] it's about what mom mommy and baby need
[2617.52 - 2622.32] and so what happens is some moms and
[2620.64 - 2624.20] I've seen this and I've had calls from
[2622.32 - 2626.60] it I've had to talk to people about it
[2624.20 - 2628.04] have contacted me that they've gone you
[2626.60 - 2629.96] know so they were so strict in their
[2628.04 - 2633.44] high protein just vegetable meaning you
[2629.96 - 2635.04] know salads and high protein diet which
[2633.44 - 2636.96] is high fat because it's you know it's
[2635.04 - 2638.96] high protein high fat with other fats in
[2636.96 - 2640.40] there lot lots and lots of coconut oil
[2638.96 - 2642.88] and lots and lots of fat and lots and
[2640.40 - 2644.48] lots of this you know healthier versions
[2642.88 - 2646.68] of course all healthier stuff that could
[2644.48 - 2648.76] be fine for some guy who's not pregnant
[2646.68 - 2650.36] or fine for a woman who's who's just you
[2648.76 - 2652.76] know maybe maybe trying to try a
[2650.36 - 2655.32] different diet but because they were
[2652.76 - 2659.12] pregnant they got underweight babies and
[2655.32 - 2661.84] they got under uh they got uh less
[2659.12 - 2664.08] breast milk on top of it less breast
[2661.84 - 2666.76] milk they had a goat formulas they had a
[2664.08 - 2668.92] goat formulas and they and and their
[2666.76 - 2672.12] babies were underweight born
[2668.92 - 2674.72] underweight be because they followed the
[2672.12 - 2676.40] trend to such dots and teas they crossed
[2674.72 - 2678.56] their tees and dotted their eyes so much
[2676.40 - 2680.80] so far on that Trend where it's like
[2678.56 - 2682.88] high protein high protein and they
[2680.80 - 2684.76] really stuck to it to such a degree that
[2682.88 - 2687.00] they didn't give in on a treat that had
[2684.76 - 2688.72] glucose meaning fructose or sugar they
[2687.00 - 2690.72] stayed away from bananas they stayed
[2688.72 - 2693.64] away from critical things that give
[2690.72 - 2696.00] babies micronutrients vitamins minerals
[2693.64 - 2698.68] and glucose to develop they got underway
[2696.00 - 2701.64] away babies they stayed away from
[2698.68 - 2703.76] potatoes red potatoes purple potatoes
[2701.64 - 2706.48] they stayed away from those things
[2703.76 - 2709.68] beautiful gold potatoes because they
[2706.48 - 2713.32] were such in fear of it from trendy
[2709.68 - 2715.56] traps and moms are suffering from it
[2713.32 - 2718.16] something to think about what that means
[2715.56 - 2719.96] is don't be concerned about protein be
[2718.16 - 2721.40] concerned about your calories be
[2719.96 - 2724.84] concerned about your calories coming
[2721.40 - 2726.72] from more of some kind of sugar Source
[2724.84 - 2729.16] that's not table sugar God forbid and
[2726.72 - 2732.64] not not corn syrup or anything like that
[2729.16 - 2735.20] but sources like potatoes okay really
[2732.64 - 2738.00] important like winter squash really
[2735.20 - 2740.08] important okay like you know artichoke
[2738.00 - 2742.12] hearts which is a starchy kind of you
[2740.08 - 2744.64] know a few brussel sprouts which is
[2742.12 - 2747.56] really starchy these are some things to
[2744.64 - 2749.32] get some important nutrients too and and
[2747.56 - 2751.72] lots of fruit different kinds of fruits
[2749.32 - 2754.08] not just a pint of small berries because
[2751.72 - 2755.84] it's allowed in your diet you know more
[2754.08 - 2758.04] than that different kinds of fruit
[2755.84 - 2759.96] fruits and more of them like a melon
[2758.04 - 2762.68] have a melon in the morning have lots of
[2759.96 - 2764.16] slices of of of beautiful melon your
[2762.68 - 2766.12] baby will love you when it's when your
[2764.16 - 2768.08] baby's in the womb and and developing
[2766.12 - 2770.20] inside your uterus your baby will love
[2768.08 - 2771.48] it because your baby will be getting
[2770.20 - 2773.92] what it's supposed to be getting from
[2771.48 - 2777.72] breast milk after your baby has arrived
[2773.92 - 2781.00] and then and then you know your baby
[2777.72 - 2783.80] want he or she wants that breast milk
[2781.00 - 2785.36] filled with glucose and you want to keep
[2783.80 - 2786.92] your breast milk good so you want to
[2785.36 - 2789.16] make sure you lots of fruit you want to
[2786.92 - 2793.20] E look you can go back to your high
[2789.16 - 2796.56] protein High extremely high fat diet
[2793.20 - 2798.96] Trend after you need your breastfed
[2796.56 - 2800.44] maybe maybe a you know you can still
[2798.96 - 2801.72] have some protein and you still want
[2800.44 - 2803.40] different vegetables and leafy greens
[2801.72 - 2805.52] which is really good protein you still
[2803.40 - 2807.16] want you still do some animal protein
[2805.52 - 2808.96] I'm not saying you can't do animal
[2807.16 - 2811.04] protein while
[2808.96 - 2812.64] pregnant that's not what I'm saying this
[2811.04 - 2814.40] is an important thing to understand you
[2812.64 - 2817.04] can still have some it's just it can't
[2814.40 - 2819.52] dominate the entire diet and you can't
[2817.04 - 2822.52] be afraid of fruit you can't be afraid
[2819.52 - 2824.60] of a potato while pregnant because of
[2822.52 - 2826.64] what I'm seeing and I knew about that
[2824.60 - 2829.72] many years ago too many many many years
[2826.64 - 2831.48] ago so supplement wise while you're
[2829.72 - 2832.92] pregnant just know be careful on what
[2831.48 - 2834.84] kind of herbs unless you're really
[2832.92 - 2836.08] Guided by your practitioner a doctor a
[2834.84 - 2837.52] really good practitioner that knows
[2836.08 - 2838.76] about pregnancies and everything else be
[2837.52 - 2840.40] careful about herbs and stuff because
[2838.76 - 2842.76] here's the thing you don't know what
[2840.40 - 2845.96] your baby likes you don't know how your
[2842.76 - 2849.44] baby's going to react if you don't react
[2845.96 - 2852.40] to something that's you that's Mommy
[2849.44 - 2854.88] that's not baby we don't know how
[2852.40 - 2859.36] babies's reacting to something we don't
[2854.88 - 2862.60] know that so don't do any exotic crazy
[2859.36 - 2864.12] herbs don't do anything like that you
[2862.60 - 2865.80] know you're doing something really
[2864.12 - 2868.28] gentle you're doing a little bit of you
[2865.80 - 2869.60] know a little bit of a sip of lemon balm
[2868.28 - 2871.44] tea and you're doing a little bit of
[2869.60 - 2873.76] that or you're doing something gentle a
[2871.44 - 2877.40] little touch of peppermint tea or you're
[2873.76 - 2879.12] doing you know some nettle leaf tea
[2877.40 - 2880.84] something you know gentle filled with
[2879.12 - 2883.24] lots of nutrients and you want a cup of
[2880.84 - 2884.96] that it's fine unless you got a
[2883.24 - 2887.80] practitioner that really knows their
[2884.96 - 2889.12] herbs really knows their herbs and
[2887.80 - 2892.92] they're even
[2889.12 - 2895.00] cautious and that's perfectly fine too
[2892.92 - 2897.84] and you know but but what I'm basically
[2895.00 - 2901.24] saying is we don't know what babies's
[2897.84 - 2902.68] doing reacting really to something that
[2901.24 - 2904.72] you know something that we're taking
[2902.68 - 2907.28] it's same thing like that with way out
[2904.72 - 2909.40] supplements here's to deal with
[2907.28 - 2912.32] supplements if you take something like
[2909.40 - 2914.64] evening primrose oil which is is
[2912.32 - 2916.88] actually you know is actually what it's
[2914.64 - 2920.44] something you can use if your baby's
[2916.88 - 2922.44] missing the deadline and of birth and
[2920.44 - 2925.32] your baby's like yeah your baby's like
[2922.44 - 2927.56] not on time and you know the doctor's
[2925.32 - 2929.64] talking about inducing labor you know
[2927.56 - 2931.56] evening primrose can really help induce
[2929.64 - 2933.52] that labor can really help push Things
[2931.56 - 2935.72] Push things through but get the baby to
[2933.52 - 2939.12] move through but your baby shouldn't
[2935.72 - 2941.32] react to Primrose Oil evening primrose
[2939.12 - 2943.88] your baby shouldn't react but wait if
[2941.32 - 2946.60] there's a capsule that has 50 different
[2943.88 - 2947.80] things in it 50 different herbs and 50
[2946.60 - 2950.08] different things and vitamins and
[2947.80 - 2952.12] minerals or 50 different you know amino
[2950.08 - 2954.24] acids of different kinds and you know
[2952.12 - 2956.20] mean meaning like kinds that aren't
[2954.24 - 2958.12] really good versus kinds that are
[2956.20 - 2961.04] naturally in a
[2958.12 - 2963.92] food what I'm saying is you got if say
[2961.04 - 2965.84] you got a complex supplement you got be
[2963.92 - 2968.88] cautious on those like keeping it's
[2965.84 - 2971.64] somewhat basic somewhat basic is what
[2968.88 - 2974.88] I'm trying to say so it's important to
[2971.64 - 2977.08] know it's like mono mono and I don't
[2974.88 - 2981.28] mean mononucleosis like I talk about a
[2977.08 - 2983.64] lot I mean mono food sometimes is really
[2981.28 - 2986.24] good for pregnancies not having a
[2983.64 - 2989.04] billion Foods on your plate a billion
[2986.24 - 2990.92] Foods you know not having a dozen Foods
[2989.04 - 2994.16] on your plate at
[2990.92 - 2997.12] once not having being just a little bit
[2994.16 - 2999.52] more sensitive to to
[2997.12 - 3001.28] concoctions concoctions for the pallet
[2999.52 - 3003.48] if you go out to dinner at a fancy
[3001.28 - 3005.24] restaurant and you know and there's just
[3003.48 - 3007.44] throwing at you all kinds of different
[3005.24 - 3009.28] things and it's just you know and it's a
[3007.44 - 3010.84] lot of different sauces made of all
[3009.28 - 3012.68] different kinds of concoctions and all
[3010.84 - 3016.24] things be careful with that is what I
[3012.68 - 3019.64] mean keeping more mono mono eating you
[3016.24 - 3022.92] know I dig mono eating for healing too I
[3019.64 - 3026.12] do I do I can't tell you how many people
[3022.92 - 3029.36] got their lives back from eating ban B
[3026.12 - 3031.56] and romae lettuce banana and
[3029.36 - 3034.68] celery by
[3031.56 - 3036.36] itself and got their lives back I can't
[3034.68 - 3037.84] I can't even tell you how many decades
[3036.36 - 3041.60] I've been able to pull people out of the
[3037.84 - 3043.08] trenches of Hell literally meaning with
[3041.60 - 3045.08] their illness and what they've G what
[3043.08 - 3047.56] they were going through from banana and
[3045.08 - 3050.12] and celery for a little while point is
[3047.56 - 3052.60] is mono is not a bad thing and when
[3050.12 - 3054.84] you're pregnant you want to you don't
[3052.60 - 3056.68] want it complex to such a degree you
[3054.84 - 3060.04] don't want to be fancy restaurants
[3056.68 - 3064.64] eating complex kind of combinations or
[3060.04 - 3067.00] even Abominations of food be careful be
[3064.64 - 3069.16] careful and that's something to consider
[3067.00 - 3071.80] keep it more mono you know you're having
[3069.16 - 3074.24] a few potatoes and you know you're
[3071.80 - 3076.52] having some you know steamed you know
[3074.24 - 3078.32] baked winter squash little bit if you
[3076.52 - 3080.92] want to sprinkle a little touch of olive
[3078.32 - 3083.28] oil on there you can if you want meaning
[3080.92 - 3084.72] something for you know flavor or a
[3083.28 - 3086.16] couple of other different things some
[3084.72 - 3089.24] different herbs and spices that are
[3086.16 - 3090.72] really really mild I mean you can do you
[3089.24 - 3092.32] can do things like if you want to keep
[3090.72 - 3094.36] it as mon as possible you don't know
[3092.32 - 3096.04] what you're going to get in restaurants
[3094.36 - 3097.96] when it comes down to your baby saying
[3096.04 - 3099.32] hey I don't like that I mean you might
[3097.96 - 3101.64] like it like the taste but your baby's
[3099.32 - 3104.64] like wait a minute I don't like this so
[3101.64 - 3106.32] that's something to consider um like
