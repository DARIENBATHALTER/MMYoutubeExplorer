[122.76 - 128.68] industries aren't St Lee they're not St
[125.92 - 129.84] Lee that's the whole point that that's
[128.68 - 131.48] what we have to understand here and
[129.84 - 133.40] alternative medicine used to be the
[131.48 - 135.40] industry first of all the regular
[133.40 - 139.28] medical industry the conventional Med
[135.40 - 140.72] medical industry was never saintly and
[139.28 - 143.32] going all the way back hundreds of years
[140.72 - 146.72] it was never saintly it was never a pure
[143.32 - 148.96] place um the doctors are the doctors are
[146.72 - 151.32] let's not let's not mess that that up
[148.96 - 154.32] let's not mess up that because that's
[151.32 - 158.28] the doctors are I mean honestly like
[154.32 - 160.96] angels and and you know and what happens
[158.28 - 163.28] is that you know alternative medicine
[160.96 - 165.12] though the the medicine the the the
[163.28 - 169.44] industry was
[165.12 - 173.80] saintly it was always pure in the
[169.44 - 175.92] 1800s the late 1800s the herbalists the
[173.80 - 177.68] naturopaths that developed the nature
[175.92 - 179.88] medicine nature
[177.68 - 182.12] medicine you know that was that was
[179.88 - 184.68] definitely and in the 1920s it was still
[182.12 - 187.96] cleaning it was still 30s 1940s 50 60s
[184.68 - 191.24] and then we got into the day the day
[187.96 - 192.64] we're into now today today's age and I'm
[191.24 - 195.72] sorry but alternative medicine the
[192.64 - 197.20] industry has is slightly tainted because
[195.72 - 198.84] these groups that I just mentioned are
[197.20 - 200.76] all kind of in there so information
[198.84 - 204.16] getting out there isn't always as like
[200.76 - 206.36] it was back in the 1950s 40s 30s in
[204.16 - 208.68] alternative
[206.36 - 210.84] medicine and you know and always
[208.68 - 212.56] remember that you
[210.84 - 214.28] know when it comes down to the
[212.56 - 216.12] practitioner itself that's different you
[214.28 - 219.20] know that's different than the
[216.12 - 222.16] practitioner the Healer the doctor
[219.20 - 224.64] they're they're Saints to me every
[222.16 - 226.16] naturopath you go and visit any
[224.64 - 228.80] naturopath you go and visit just
[226.16 - 231.40] remember there's probably hundreds of a
[228.80 - 234.08] hundred easy hundred if not hundreds of
[231.40 - 235.96] naturopaths that went to prison for no
[234.08 - 238.76] reason just for waking up in the
[235.96 - 243.08] morning putting on their their white
[238.76 - 244.68] coat and helping people not because of
[243.08 - 246.52] anything that harm or anything to happen
[244.68 - 247.68] to people because the conventional
[246.52 - 251.76] industry
[247.68 - 254.04] ostracized and and privately went after
[251.76 - 256.36] all the naturopaths in the old days all
[254.04 - 258.24] the chiropractors in the old days when
[256.36 - 259.40] medicine you know wanted to dominate
[258.24 - 261.64] when conventional medicine wanted to
[259.40 - 263.96] dominate and own it all and they didn't
[261.64 - 266.88] like the they didn't like the nature
[263.96 - 267.68] medicine rising up in the late 1800s and
[266.88 - 269.84] early
[267.68 - 272.64] 1900s I mean there those doctors were
[269.84 - 275.48] hung they were hung by their feet and
[272.64 - 277.32] beaten and and you just need to know
[275.48 - 280.00] that so when you go to your natural path
[277.32 - 282.52] just you need respect and
[280.00 - 285.24] honor where we've come from and how far
[282.52 - 286.96] we've come it's like
[285.24 - 289.04] unbelievable and you go to your
[286.96 - 290.56] chiropractor you need to respect that
[289.04 - 291.84] you need respect if you go to your
[290.56 - 293.04] healer you need to respect that and if
[291.84 - 294.88] you go to your conventional doctor you
[293.04 - 297.24] need to respect that too of
[294.88 - 299.04] course it wasn't wasn't the doctor's
[297.24 - 301.28] faults it was the industry it was the
[299.04 - 302.80] industry it was the industry I know you
[301.28 - 304.48] know I know I'm going on a tangent about
[302.80 - 305.96] this but it's important to know to have
[304.48 - 309.16] that kind of respect when you go and see
[305.96 - 311.44] your your healer when you go to see your
[309.16 - 313.92] naturopath now I have naturopaths tell
[311.44 - 316.60] me they say you know I'm I'm doing
[313.92 - 317.84] everything I can I'm doing my best
[316.60 - 320.40] helping out my
[317.84 - 323.72] patients and he gets this Ang angry
[320.40 - 326.48] patient that just you know that just is
[323.72 - 328.00] is is upset about something and he
[326.48 - 329.20] doesn't like the the naturopath or
[328.00 - 330.44] something like that the naturopath is
[329.20 - 332.32] like I don't know what to do I'm I'm
[330.44 - 333.96] doing everything I can I care I got
[332.32 - 337.60] compassion I want the person

[717.56 - 723.32] c a very sensitive nerve responsible for
[720.68 - 725.44] so many different problems with
[723.32 - 726.64] neurological problems well anyway that
[725.44 - 729.76] frenic

[729.76 - 732.76] rides up rides up through the chest goes
[731.48 - 734.16] up through the left side of the chest
[732.76 - 736.32] and there's a frenic nerve on the right
[734.16 - 737.76] side top of that colon on the right side
[736.32 - 740.20] rides up the right right side of your
[737.76 - 741.24] chest and that frenic nerve there two
[740.20 - 744.00] frenic
[741.24 - 745.36] nerves right they're hypers sensitive
[744.00 - 747.28] they could be really hypers sensitive in
[745.36 - 748.92] a lot of people you get gastritis and a
[747.28 - 753.16] gas bubble gets trapped up in that Cor
[748.92 - 754.80] corner on each corner of the colon not
[753.16 - 757.88] the small intestinal tract the colon on
[754.80 - 760.52] each Corner left side corner right side
[757.88 - 762.80] corner underneath the ribs right there
[760.52 - 765.92] and man you got like Sparky going on
[762.80 - 767.84] like like oh my God like it could it
[765.92 - 770.88] could spark up those
[767.84 - 772.52] nerves cause a spasm cause pain going
[770.88 - 774.48] all the way up sharp pain jagg of pain
[772.52 - 776.68] all the way up all the way up the chest
[774.48 - 778.32] through the kind of heart region the
[776.68 - 780.20] other side too uh right up through the
[778.32 - 782.04] neck give you cramp get give you kind of
[780.20 - 784.52] cramped up that's just a gas bubble
[782.04 - 786.88] could be tiny too if it's a toxic gas
[784.52 - 791.08] bubble if it's a toxic gas bubble could
[786.88 - 792.80] be tiny I got celery juice with me now I
[791.08 - 794.68] have celery juice with me a lot but I
[792.80 - 797.84] have celery juice with me purposely on
[794.68 - 800.88] this show today CU this is acid reflux
[797.84 - 802.92] show I got celery juice here why would I
[800.88 - 805.92] have celery juice for acid reflux who
[802.92 - 807.20] who who cares who would know what what
[805.92 - 808.92] like what does that have what does that
[807.20 - 811.64] do what does celery juice do it does all
[808.92 - 814.76] lot I can't wait to tell
[811.64 - 816.32] you so there's a lot of mystery in our
[814.76 - 818.64] gastrointestinal tract there's a lot of
[816.32 - 821.20] lot of mystery and all that on every
[818.64 - 822.72] level you know so mysterious that nobody
[821.20 - 824.60] even knows what happens to food once it
[822.72 - 826.32] enters the stomach I say that a lot I'm
[824.60 - 828.72] going to say it again and if you're
[826.32 - 831.92] brand new to the show I'm going to tell
[828.72 - 836.20] you something right now right
[831.92 - 837.44] now 500 years from now from this day
[836.20 - 838.96] they're still not going to know what
[837.44 - 841.80] happens to food when it enters the
[838.96 - 843.32] stomach they're still not going to know
[841.80 - 846.12] no one's going to know there's going to
[843.32 - 848.72] be theories and more theories the enzyme
[846.12 - 850.72] factor is a theory yes enzymes exist
[848.72 - 854.16] they do play a role but what they do is
[850.72 - 856.08] theoretical nobody knows what they do
[854.16 - 859.80] nobody knows what they
[856.08 - 861.92] do seriously even when we have a theory
[859.80 - 863.92] of they break down food they cause you
[861.92 - 867.36] know they cause a gastric breakdown of
[863.92 - 869.48] food they help assist in digestion
[867.36 - 870.92] Theory because we don't know there's no
[869.48 - 873.92] way to measure it no way to weigh it
[870.92 - 875.52] nobody can measure it nobody God knows
[873.92 - 878.92] what happens inside the stomach when
[875.52 - 881.20] food's dropped in there God
[878.92 - 884.88] knows yeah God and if you don't believe
[881.20 - 888.84] in God it's fine the universe universe
[884.88 - 892.00] knows okay and and it's going to be like
[888.84 - 895.00] that for 500 years 700 years a th000
[892.00 - 897.20] years 1500 years 2,000 years and if we
[895.00 - 899.24] haven't blown this planet to nothing by
[897.20 - 903.96] then if we haven't blown it into Smither
[899.24 - 907.56] and Ash and boulders burning Boulders
[903.96 - 910.08] and we hav't literally nuked it and
[907.56 - 913.12] wiped it clean by then if we haven't
[910.08 - 915.28] burned it to just a just a ball of
[913.12 - 918.04] nothingness by then we're still not
[915.28 - 921.04] going to know what drops inside our
[918.04 - 922.48] stomach we're still not going to know
[921.04 - 924.72] and don't think I Haven an asked Spirit
[922.48 - 927.48] when the world does end or if it does at
[924.72 - 929.84] all I have many times and I do have
[927.48 - 932.20] secrets about if the world is if it's
[929.84 - 933.76] not when if it is or if it's never or I
[932.20 - 936.28] have secrets to all that I am going to
[933.76 - 937.36] do a book on that down the road but
[936.28 - 939.16] there's just too much medical
[937.36 - 940.52] information in the way there's too much
[939.16 - 941.88] medical information there's too much
[940.52 - 943.96] chronic illness and it needs to be
[941.88 - 946.16] addressed and I just I got to push off
[943.96 - 949.08] the fun stuff I have to push off the fun
[946.16 - 950.84] stuff I have to push it away push it
[949.08 - 955.88] away
[950.84 - 957.08] so the deal is the deal is that um
[955.88 - 959.52] because we don't know what happens to
[957.08 - 961.16] food in the stomach we're not going to
[959.52 - 963.44] know what foods really do help and
[961.16 - 964.84] change what's happening down in there
[963.44 - 967.36] like when you put celery juice in the
[964.84 - 970.56] stomach and I'm going to take a little
[967.36 - 971.76] sip I feel my I feel my acid reflux
[970.56 - 974.68] already going
[971.76 - 975.40] away I don't have any acid reflux but if
[974.68 - 978.80] I
[975.40 - 981.56] did it would start fixing
[978.80 - 983.68] it what is acid reflux let's go into
[981.56 - 986.12] that let's go into
[983.68 - 987.80] that it doesn't mean I took another sip
[986.12 - 989.72] of celery juice it doesn't mean I can't
[987.80 - 991.68] get acid re flux if I'm under tremendous
[989.72 - 992.72] stress someday like I'm always under
[991.68 - 995.08] stress
[992.72 - 996.52] anyway deadlines and stuff like that I
[995.08 - 998.92] got to get the information out to you I
[996.52 - 1000.48] got to get all the blog blog articles
[998.92 - 1002.16] out to you I got to get all these radio
[1000.48 - 1003.76] shows done I got to get the books done I
[1002.16 - 1006.72] got to you know I got to be of help and
[1003.76 - 1008.40] service any way I can in between it all
[1006.72 - 1010.24] in any way
[1008.40 - 1012.64] possible
[1010.24 - 1014.56] and and doesn't mean you know I can't
[1012.64 - 1016.96] get some stress and and and something
[1014.56 - 1020.12] also changed chemist chemistry-wise in
[1016.96 - 1022.04] the gut comes some stress happening
[1020.12 - 1024.88] creating acid reflux I'm I don't want to
[1022.04 - 1026.72] get it I hope I don't get it but if I do
[1024.88 - 1028.64] which I could be susceptible to that
[1026.72 - 1031.56] darn right someone said to me well
[1028.64 - 1034.16] you're you're you know you're Anthony
[1031.56 - 1038.00] William you you can't be susceptible to
[1034.16 - 1040.28] anything well if I was not human if I
[1038.00 - 1042.84] was if it was not human then sure I'm
[1040.28 - 1044.32] human I'm just like you yeah I hear a
[1042.84 - 1046.80] voice perfectly clear but if I don't
[1044.32 - 1049.44] take care of myself you know some it's
[1046.80 - 1052.40] Anything Could Happen
[1049.44 - 1052.40] but I don't take care of
[1052.44 - 1057.12] myself I mean it's just way the ball
[1054.96 - 1060.00] rolls the way the ball rolls
[1057.12 - 1062.04] so celery juice okay so what what what
[1060.00 - 1063.28] is the bad what is this acid what is
[1062.04 - 1067.56] this acid
[1063.28 - 1070.92] reflux acid reflux aets those aets
[1067.56 - 1074.52] aren't gastric acids those aren't
[1070.92 - 1076.92] gastric acids news flash they're not
[1074.52 - 1080.44] gastric
[1076.92 - 1083.00] acid so when you get acid reflux and
[1080.44 - 1085.96] it's always
[1083.00 - 1087.72] happening news flash those aren't the
[1085.96 - 1089.36] glands in the stomach creating gastric
[1087.72 - 1091.00] acid and hydrochloric acid that's not
[1089.36 - 1095.00] what that is that is an hydrochloric
[1091.00 - 1098.28] acid burns like hell goes up the
[1095.00 - 1101.36] esophagus Burns everything goes into
[1098.28 - 1104.12] your throat they kind of spit it
[1101.36 - 1105.24] out some people do some people don't it
[1104.12 - 1107.76] can make you
[1105.24 - 1110.72] cough cough and cough and coughing all
[1107.76 - 1113.48] night all night long coughing on some
[1110.72 - 1116.48] mucus too I've seen people
[1113.48 - 1118.40] suffer I've seen people suffer or it's
[1116.48 - 1120.20] just you Burns and it's rising up Burns
[1118.40 - 1126.00] and it rises up Burns and it rises up
[1120.20 - 1126.00] Burns and it rises up that's not gastric
[1126.60 - 1133.60] acid would you believe
[1129.28 - 1136.60] it but you know back to chronic chronic
[1133.60 - 1139.28] illness research back to how it's so
[1136.60 - 1142.00] deficient and anemic back to how you
[1139.28 - 1144.68] know they can go to the best clinics the
[1142.00 - 1146.12] best doctors it's not their fault
[1144.68 - 1147.20] believe me it's not their fault they
[1146.12 - 1149.72] just don't
[1147.20 - 1152.92] know that's not gastric
[1149.72 - 1155.72] acid it's an acid it's an acid produced
[1152.92 - 1159.40] by something it's an acid produced
[1155.72 - 1161.92] produced by poison inside the liver but
[1159.40 - 1165.80] but but more than that it's an acid
[1161.92 - 1168.28] produced by bacteria by
[1165.80 - 1170.08] bacteria I'll say it again it's an acid
[1168.28 - 1171.24] produced by bacteria you got acid reflux
[1170.08 - 1173.68] there's a good
[1171.24 - 1174.84] chance it's not reflux because you got a
[1173.68 - 1176.12] kink and we're going to talk about that
[1174.84 - 1177.60] if you have something going on that's
[1176.12 - 1178.60] visible if you got something going on
[1177.60 - 1180.56] like a
[1178.60 - 1182.72] kink and that's what I love about
[1180.56 - 1184.20] medicine too is you you get an MRI you
[1182.72 - 1185.92] could get a because I can't be
[1184.20 - 1188.80] everywhere to get people MRIs through
[1185.92 - 1190.32] spirit I can't I tried that I tried that
[1188.80 - 1192.96] for
[1190.32 - 1194.20] decades and I still can't get every I
[1192.96 - 1196.32] can't reach everybody I can't get
[1194.20 - 1199.68] everybody done can't get the millions of
[1196.32 - 1201.60] people that need help with me
[1199.68 - 1204.28] personally can't do so I got to do it
[1201.60 - 1207.80] through the books the
[1204.28 - 1209.92] books the series the medical medium
[1207.80 - 1211.08] series if you got one of them make sure
[1209.92 - 1213.20] you get them all because they're all
[1211.08 - 1215.32] interconnected they're all
[1213.20 - 1217.28] interconnected it's
[1215.32 - 1220.00] important they're they're they're there
[1217.28 - 1220.96] for a reason and then here's the deal
[1220.00 - 1223.16] here's the
[1220.96 - 1226.00] deal if you don't have a kink if you
[1223.16 - 1228.24] don't have something busted
[1226.00 - 1230.36] inside I don't mean busted but you you
[1228.24 - 1232.08] know what I mean you don't have because
[1230.36 - 1233.60] what happens is we get wonky in there
[1232.08 - 1235.36] internally we get first of all we get
[1233.60 - 1237.28] hernas we get high anal hernas that
[1235.36 - 1240.52] actually can cause a reflux that can
[1237.28 - 1242.56] cause non bacteria related acid reflux
[1240.52 - 1244.52] so if everything rolls out there's no
[1242.56 - 1246.96] hiatal
[1244.52 - 1250.36] hernia there's no
[1246.96 - 1251.88] hernia in a weird place that maybe not
[1250.36 - 1254.24] just Hiatal but there's all kinds of
[1251.88 - 1256.96] hernas you can get in weird
[1254.24 - 1260.08] places and uh and believe me I'm not I'm
[1256.96 - 1262.84] not immune to a hernia I mean I could
[1260.08 - 1264.64] pick up something stupid and heavy and
[1262.84 - 1267.20] pop something out just like the best of
[1264.64 - 1269.80] anybody can it's another thing too we
[1267.20 - 1271.04] got to always be careful with that um we
[1269.80 - 1272.48] got to be careful we get pushed into
[1271.04 - 1274.08] workouts by the way that's just that's
[1272.48 - 1276.00] just LED I I know I'm taking this off
[1274.08 - 1278.00] track a little but not not necessarily
[1276.00 - 1281.12] because if I can avoid a hernia with you
[1278.00 - 1283.00] that's amazing um and then hey I could
[1281.12 - 1285.08] avoid possible acid reflex then there
[1283.00 - 1287.68] you go but if you're doing workouts or
[1285.08 - 1290.04] you get sold into a workout thing don't
[1287.68 - 1293.00] push it too hard a lot of a lot of
[1290.04 - 1294.72] trainers they don't realize in so many
[1293.00 - 1296.36] different ways they have people pick up
[1294.72 - 1301.20] tires and stuff like that you just you
[1296.36 - 1302.28] just don't do that that's so so silly
[1301.20 - 1304.36] you just don't do that if you're a
[1302.28 - 1307.12] trainer do offering that just stop that
[1304.36 - 1308.52] stop that stop that whole thing or
[1307.12 - 1309.76] you're like taking sledgehammers you
[1308.52 - 1312.60] give them a sledgehammer you have them
[1309.76 - 1313.72] hit a tire with it just don't do that I
[1312.60 - 1315.84] can't tell you how many people get
[1313.72 - 1318.20] hernas from that crap you don't even
[1315.84 - 1320.04] know because everybody's doing that and
[1318.20 - 1322.52] they're all getting hernas I know I know
[1320.04 - 1325.24] so I hear about it all the time don't be
[1322.52 - 1327.76] picking up giant tractor tires with
[1325.24 - 1329.56] everything you got and pushing it over
[1327.76 - 1333.72] there's nothing to prove there don't do
[1329.56 - 1335.12] it do do responsible exercising okay you
[1333.72 - 1336.52] do you know resistance you could do
[1335.12 - 1338.16] weights you could do resistance you can
[1336.52 - 1340.76] jog you can run anything you like to do
[1338.16 - 1343.16] but you just just don't do things like
[1340.76 - 1344.96] picking up gigantic tractor tires and
[1343.16 - 1348.88] pushing them over in in in in the
[1344.96 - 1350.12] workout place stuff like that oh be
[1348.88 - 1352.84] careful be
[1350.12 - 1356.56] careful um okay so let's go back let's
[1352.84 - 1358.16] go back sorry guys let's go back into
[1356.56 - 1360.64] this if you don't have a kink if you
[1358.16 - 1363.20] don't have a hernia if you don't have a
[1360.64 - 1365.16] blockage and those are easy to see for
[1363.20 - 1366.68] MRIs and CAT scans and stuff like that
[1365.16 - 1369.40] and ultrasounds
[1366.68 - 1371.52] and and you know you go to the doctor
[1369.40 - 1373.04] and you swallow that barium you swallow
[1371.52 - 1375.68] that you know that glow-in-the-dark
[1373.04 - 1378.68] material and then you go and get an
[1375.68 - 1380.44] x-ray whatever it is if nothing's like
[1378.68 - 1383.28] that is going on and you got the acid
[1380.44 - 1385.80] reflux and you got some bacteria
[1383.28 - 1387.88] Brewing could be undiagnosed bacteria of
[1385.80 - 1391.56] course that's how it works I mean
[1387.88 - 1393.32] hpylori can cause it but hpylori becomes
[1391.56 - 1396.36] it's diagnosable sometimes and sometimes
[1393.32 - 1400.76] it's not it's very elusive it it evades
[1396.36 - 1403.00] andc escapes tests it tests all the time
[1400.76 - 1406.88] hpylori is a
[1403.00 - 1408.96] bacteria interesting Critter but
[1406.88 - 1410.88] bacteria
[1408.96 - 1414.04] produces an
[1410.88 - 1417.24] acid produces an
[1414.04 - 1419.64] acid that will trick out and mimic an
[1417.24 - 1421.68] acid similar to gastric acid which will
[1419.64 - 1423.68] trick out the doctor physician thinking
[1421.68 - 1425.76] that this is just a tremendous amount of
[1423.68 - 1427.64] acid regardless and not really know what
[1425.76 - 1432.96] kind and what kind and
[1427.64 - 1434.76] where bacterial acids that's what it is
[1432.96 - 1436.64] that's what that acid is it's constantly
[1434.76 - 1438.12] causing problems it's constantly going
[1436.64 - 1441.40] up the esophagus it's const constantly
[1438.12 - 1445.56] burning everything that's bacterial
[1441.40 - 1448.04] acid heartburn a lot of times is a gas
[1445.56 - 1451.04] bubble it's a gas
[1448.04 - 1452.48] bubble and and not acid so a lot of
[1451.04 - 1454.60] different cases of heartburn someone
[1452.48 - 1456.00] describes like I got a heartburn I got
[1454.60 - 1456.88] heartburn that you know I can't tell you
[1456.00 - 1458.56] how many people they came to me and
[1456.88 - 1461.92] they're like I got heartburn in the old
[1458.56 - 1464.92] days like that's that's gastritis and
[1461.92 - 1466.52] like maybe it is yeah it is and then
[1464.92 - 1467.96] there's heartburn world oh okay now it's
[1466.52 - 1470.48] burning up here okay no that that's
[1467.96 - 1472.60] burning yeah no that's heartburn that's
[1470.48 - 1475.36] heartburn that's that's that's that's
[1472.60 - 1477.56] you know that's acid
[1475.36 - 1481.04] reflux and
[1477.56 - 1486.64] um so what happens is you got bacterial
[1481.04 - 1489.76] acid that's not gland produced gland
[1486.64 - 1491.36] produced gastric acid and hydrochloric
[1489.76 - 1495.92] acid in the
[1491.36 - 1500.48] stomach do you know what happens when
[1495.92 - 1503.00] you're getting acid reflux from Bad acid
[1500.48 - 1506.96] bacterial produced
[1503.00 - 1509.56] acid do you know what
[1506.96 - 1512.52] happens it means you have no
[1509.56 - 1514.60] hydrochloric acid left or very little
[1512.52 - 1517.56] because if you did have enough
[1514.60 - 1521.16] hydrochloric acid it would be destroying
[1517.56 - 1524.92] the bacteria so you wouldn't have acid
[1521.16 - 1528.36] reflux yep
[1524.92 - 1530.84] yep yep yes
[1528.36 - 1531.96] I'm trying not to say that's right
[1530.84 - 1535.40] that's
[1531.96 - 1538.20] right that's what's going on there
[1535.40 - 1540.00] what's going on is if you got the bad
[1538.20 - 1542.88] acids and you got that acid reflux and
[1540.00 - 1545.40] that's bacterial produced
[1542.88 - 1548.12] reflux that's what that acid is it's
[1545.40 - 1550.52] it's acids produced by
[1548.12 - 1552.88] bacteria if that's going on that means
[1550.52 - 1555.48] you don't have any toone to very little
[1552.88 - 1557.28] hydrochloric acid but that might not be
[1555.48 - 1559.32] diagnosed properly at a practitioner's
[1557.28 - 1561.12] office both conventional or alternative
[1559.32 - 1562.68] or functional because they think you're
[1561.12 - 1564.32] filled with acid so they're thinking you
[1562.68 - 1567.76] got tons of hydrochloric acid or they're
[1564.32 - 1571.20] think you got tons of gastric acid
[1567.76 - 1573.12] no you got acid in your gastric system
[1571.20 - 1575.04] but it's coming from
[1573.12 - 1576.76] bacteria it doesn't mean taking
[1575.04 - 1578.44] antibiotics either it doesn't mean you
[1576.76 - 1580.08] got to jump on the antibiotic thing to
[1578.44 - 1582.56] start killing off bacteria because that
[1580.08 - 1584.28] will just create more bacteria and more
[1582.56 - 1586.44] bacterial
[1584.28 - 1588.44] acid I know so there's so many people
[1586.44 - 1590.16] with h pyloric diagnosed hpor did they
[1588.44 - 1591.60] do the antibiotics for hpor and then
[1590.16 - 1593.84] they have the worst aser reflux for the
[1591.60 - 1596.68] next 10 years I see that all the time I
[1593.84 - 1599.00] saw that all the
[1596.68 - 1600.84] time and you know we so and I'm not
[1599.00 - 1602.32] against antibiotics they're great when
[1600.84 - 1603.44] when you need them for certain things I
[1602.32 - 1606.28] mean there's there's things you need
[1603.44 - 1609.44] them for there's no doubt about
[1606.28 - 1610.84] it but we could be cautious when we use
[1609.44 - 1614.32] them and how we use
[1610.84 - 1616.92] them that's important to
[1614.32 - 1618.76] know sip of celery juice again so here's
[1616.92 - 1620.04] the deal
[1618.76 - 1623.32] here's the
[1620.04 - 1624.80] deal if we have that kind of problem
[1623.32 - 1626.08] going on that means our hydrochloric
[1624.80 - 1627.76] acid is gone so we have to build their
[1626.08 - 1631.56] hydrochloric acid back up and it doesn't
[1627.76 - 1635.60] mean taking HCL capsules or HCL pills
[1631.56 - 1639.04] hydrochloric acid pills we need to build
[1635.60 - 1640.40] it back up and that's really important
[1639.04 - 1642.72] very important we need to change the
[1640.40 - 1644.20] diet around too because there's
[1642.72 - 1646.28] something in our diet that's feeding
[1644.20 - 1648.00] bacteria whatever that is could be wheat
[1646.28 - 1651.00] and gluten could be corn could be weak
[1648.00 - 1653.84] gluten could be Dairy could be eggs eggs
[1651.00 - 1657.00] feeds bacteria like no other you know
[1653.84 - 1659.28] what even if you have your best chicken
[1657.00 - 1661.80] eggs from your best friend's
[1659.28 - 1664.12] backyard which is the ones to eat if
[1661.80 - 1666.04] you're going to eat an egg even if you
[1664.12 - 1669.32] have the BET and the the the yolk is
[1666.04 - 1672.00] nice and dark it's not like Factory
[1669.32 - 1674.52] chicken eggs the yolk is nice and
[1672.00 - 1677.72] dark delicious
[1674.52 - 1679.16] egg right I mean a coyote with would
[1677.72 - 1683.08] love that
[1679.16 - 1685.80] egg a fox would love that egg my God be
[1683.08 - 1689.56] a fox's dream to get that kind of
[1685.80 - 1692.56] egg and you know even even those kinds
[1689.56 - 1695.40] of eggs which you know which are the
[1692.56 - 1697.12] nutritious ones they still will feed a
[1695.40 - 1698.20] bacteria and it's not the egg's fault
[1697.12 - 1700.56] it's not the chicken's fault it's not
[1698.20 - 1702.92] your fault I said this before actually
[1700.56 - 1704.44] recently that the medical industry not
[1702.92 - 1706.16] the alternative medical industry the
[1704.44 - 1709.04] conventional medical industry ruined
[1706.16 - 1710.96] eggs for us they ruined it as a food
[1709.04 - 1713.28] they ruined it as a food
[1710.96 - 1716.28] source because they used it in the lab
[1713.28 - 1720.36] to feed and raise bacteria for a hundred
[1716.28 - 1723.00] years now and that's what they did and
[1720.36 - 1725.08] they used it in the labs to feed viruses
[1723.00 - 1727.36] and bacteria to play around with bugs
[1725.08 - 1729.56] and pathogens they used it as a food
[1727.36 - 1731.80] source I don't care what anybody tells
[1729.56 - 1733.96] me they're wrong if they say no that's
[1731.80 - 1735.96] not true and they're wrong if they say
[1733.96 - 1738.20] that bugs don't eat anything they're
[1735.96 - 1739.68] wrong wrong wrong I don't care if you're
[1738.20 - 1742.48] a scientist saying it I don't care
[1739.68 - 1744.28] you're wrong I don't know I don't know
[1742.48 - 1745.80] why you don't have the right information
[1744.28 - 1747.44] I don't know how that happened I don't
[1745.80 - 1749.00] know if it wasn't just taught to you or
[1747.44 - 1750.72] what it wasn't told to you or your
[1749.00 - 1752.08] supervisor didn't tell you at a lab or
[1750.72 - 1754.16] something whatever happened or there
[1752.08 - 1757.80] wasn't a study on it that you could read
[1754.16 - 1760.92] but you're wrong bugs feed off of things
[1757.80 - 1762.24] food food food like we feed off of food
[1760.92 - 1763.96] and eggs are one of them and it's not
[1762.24 - 1766.36] that this would have never happened if
[1763.96 - 1768.64] they didn't use egg they used corn too
[1766.36 - 1771.96] corn they ruined corn on
[1768.64 - 1774.40] us corn is delicious totally screwed
[1771.96 - 1777.44] that up the medical industry ruined that
[1774.40 - 1778.84] on us and then they grow all the GMO
[1777.44 - 1781.56] medical corn on top of it and they
[1778.84 - 1783.92] ruined it even more and they ruined it
[1781.56 - 1786.16] it was corn eggs and even some Dairy was
[1783.92 - 1789.52] used to Corn eggs mostly but these are
[1786.16 - 1792.72] the things that feed the bugs they feed
[1789.52 - 1794.00] the bugs so you know so diet matters so
[1792.72 - 1795.72] that's important to know so we got to
[1794.00 - 1797.08] build up the hydrochloric acid we got to
[1795.72 - 1798.60] clean up the liver a little bit cuz the
[1797.08 - 1799.72] liver is not functioning that great if
[1798.60 - 1801.76] we have acid
[1799.72 - 1803.12] reflux that's going to be a big part of
[1801.76 - 1805.80] it too might have a fatty liver
[1803.12 - 1807.36] developing pre fatty liver might be
[1805.80 - 1808.88] pre-diabetic for a lot of people with
[1807.36 - 1811.40] acid reflux they have this pre
[1808.88 - 1814.96] pre-diabetes not pre-diabetes pre
[1811.40 - 1818.52] pre-diabetes and then guess what guess
[1814.96 - 1822.96] what there's pre pre pre-diabetes
[1818.52 - 1826.24] interesting huh pre pre pre-diabetes PPP
[1822.96 - 1827.88] diabetes that's right nobody knows that
[1826.24 - 1830.64] either
[1827.88 - 1831.96] and that is happening in people so
[1830.64 - 1833.20] that's going on with their liver and
[1831.96 - 1834.96] that's what's happening it's all liver
[1833.20 - 1836.36] caused and then you got you know weak
[1834.96 - 1838.16] digestion because if the liver is
[1836.36 - 1841.72] getting beaten down then the liver
[1838.16 - 1843.96] doesn't produce the strong bile so that
[1841.72 - 1847.64] means your stomach has to
[1843.96 - 1849.92] overproduce hydrochloric acid your your
[1847.64 - 1852.28] stomach has to overproduce hydrochloric
[1849.92 - 1856.20] acid and wears it out wears the stomach
[1852.28 - 1858.76] right out exhausts the stomach's gastric
[1856.20 - 1860.80] ability to produce the proper kind of
[1858.76 - 1863.60] acids because the liver's so burdened
[1860.80 - 1865.84] and and so constantly having to spit out
[1863.60 - 1868.44] all that bile to digest tons of protein
[1865.84 - 1871.04] and tons of fat in everybody's diet the
[1868.44 - 1873.44] liver weakens and breaking down breaking
[1871.04 - 1875.20] down it breaks down is breaking a word
[1873.44 - 1877.52] it could be and you know here's the
[1875.20 - 1881.04] thing with all that
[1877.52 - 1884.32] happening and then what goes wrong is
[1881.04 - 1886.92] the stomach the HCL starts to then
[1884.32 - 1887.92] diminish starts to WAN starts to fall
[1886.92 - 1889.76] back
[1887.92 - 1891.44] the glands in the stomach can't produce
[1889.76 - 1892.88] the stomach can't produce anymore and if
[1891.44 - 1894.32] you're not drinking celery juice and
[1892.88 - 1896.20] you're not taking care of yourself you
[1894.32 - 1898.32] can't even build your stomach acids back
[1896.20 - 1901.68] up you can't even clean the liver up and
[1898.32 - 1904.04] build it back up and people go on even
[1901.68 - 1905.92] higher protein diets and they wear their
[1904.04 - 1907.08] liver down more even if things gotten
[1905.92 - 1908.24] better in their health in other ways
[1907.08 - 1909.48] they're still breaking their liver down
[1908.24 - 1912.48] they're still setting themselves up for
[1909.48 - 1913.80] the worst hydrochloric acid deficiency
[1912.48 - 1915.04] and they're setting themselves up for
[1913.80 - 1917.12] down the road WEA the time they're in
[1915.04 - 1919.12] their 50s or 30s or 80s or whatever
[1917.12 - 1920.80] whatever it's going to be they're going
[1919.12 - 1922.80] to have that acid reflux kick up because
[1920.80 - 1925.56] that bacteria is going to grow bacteria
[1922.80 - 1927.72] is going to grow and when it grows
[1925.56 - 1929.36] produces bad acid your Hydrochloric
[1927.72 - 1932.28] acid's too weak you don't have enough
[1929.36 - 1934.72] hydrochloric acid to kill off that
[1932.28 - 1937.00] bacteria and remember that hydrochloric
[1934.72 - 1938.80] acid blend is a seven blend that's that
[1937.00 - 1940.24] only Spirit knows and release that
[1938.80 - 1942.72] information I talked about that in the
[1940.24 - 1946.08] first book I'm going to talk about it
[1942.72 - 1948.04] again in the next
[1946.08 - 1949.24] book
[1948.04 - 1953.08] and
[1949.24 - 1954.80] so and what happens is that seven blend
[1953.08 - 1956.60] three of that seven could be diminishing
[1954.80 - 1958.84] so then practitioner doesn't even know
[1956.60 - 1961.60] somebody's hydrochloric acid is even
[1958.84 - 1963.84] low so we have to build up the HCL to
[1961.60 - 1965.28] kill off the bacteria so the overgrowth
[1963.84 - 1967.64] doesn't happen and I'm not just talking
[1965.28 - 1970.60] about sibo small intestinal tract you
[1967.64 - 1973.28] know bacterial overgrowth I'm talking
[1970.60 - 1976.04] about bacteria that's just not that's
[1973.28 - 1979.00] just in general sitting in the
[1976.04 - 1981.00] dadum
[1979.00 - 1983.32] and then sitting in the in this in the
[1981.00 - 1984.88] stomach pouch the bottom of the pouch
[1983.32 - 1986.08] there's this well there a well at the
[1984.88 - 1989.00] bottom of the
[1986.08 - 1991.80] pouch stomach pouch it's a little
[1989.00 - 1995.08] well okay and there's this little spot
[1991.80 - 1997.44] too that dips
[1995.08 - 2000.76] down and and stuff collects in that
[1997.44 - 2002.64] little spot it collects there right
[2000.76 - 2004.52] there that's where bacteria loves to
[2002.64 - 2007.24] grow right in that little spot do you
[2004.52 - 2008.80] ever go to the beach and it's low tide
[2007.24 - 2010.96] and there's water in this one little
[2008.80 - 2013.32] spot but yet there's no water in that
[2010.96 - 2015.80] spot that's how what it's like there's a
[2013.32 - 2018.20] little spot in the bottom of the
[2015.80 - 2021.24] stomach little spot little little patch
[2018.20 - 2023.28] in there it's almostly you know a little
[2021.24 - 2025.84] spot and right there at the bottom of
[2023.28 - 2027.92] the corner there it's you know little
[2025.84 - 2029.96] spot lots of things can grow in there
[2027.92 - 2031.76] bacteria loves to grow there especially
[2029.96 - 2033.72] if somebody's got a weak hydrochloric
[2031.76 - 2038.76] acid the bacteria just spawns and grows
[2033.72 - 2043.04] right there and when it does it spawns
[2038.76 - 2047.04] and creates acid not hydrochloric acid
[2043.04 - 2050.68] no not the seven blend no not other
[2047.04 - 2055.56] factors in gastric acid from glands
[2050.68 - 2060.04] no it spawns and grows an ugly mutant
[2055.56 - 2064.60] foreign acid that mimics acid stomach
[2060.04 - 2064.60] acid hydrocor whatever mimics all the
[2065.32 - 2071.12] acids and that's what it does and that's
[2068.48 - 2073.56] the bacteria right there that creates
[2071.12 - 2075.04] that and sure you can have sibo too
[2073.56 - 2076.92] which we did in the sibo show which is
[2075.04 - 2079.48] all strep a cacus that's defin and that
[2076.92 - 2081.44] strep can get in there too and strep in
[2079.48 - 2083.32] the small intestinal tract if it's high
[2081.44 - 2085.64] enough can create a lot of acid
[2083.32 - 2088.64] absolutely and that can spew up into
[2085.64 - 2090.20] dadum and push up even further into the
[2088.64 - 2091.88] stomach and somebody could have a lot of
[2090.20 - 2094.88] acid going
[2091.88 - 2094.88] on
[2095.08 - 2100.00] yeah it's all it's it's all fixable
[2097.76 - 2102.12] though it's all fixable it's all we can
[2100.00 - 2104.12] all work on it we can all get it better
[2102.12 - 2105.72] we can all do things about it we can all
[2104.12 - 2107.72] get it in the right place we can get rid
[2105.72 - 2111.16] of acid reflux but what I like about
[2107.72 - 2112.48] doing the show on acid reflux is you
[2111.16 - 2113.72] know you're covering a few things you
[2112.48 - 2116.60] want to get the liver a little bit
[2113.72 - 2119.24] better you want to knock down
[2116.60 - 2121.12] bacteria right talked about kinks in the
[2119.24 - 2122.48] gut kinks in the intestinal tract I
[2121.12 - 2124.16] hernas different kind of her we're
[2122.48 - 2126.88] covering a lot of
[2124.16 - 2128.68] ground so it's not just this thing where
[2126.88 - 2131.36] okay I got acid reflux let me find a
[2128.68 - 2135.56] pill for it let's see if
[2131.36 - 2138.84] aw has you know has some kind of pill
[2135.56 - 2140.40] the magical natural pill because I got
[2138.84 - 2141.84] this acid reflex no it's more than that
[2140.40 - 2143.16] it's the information because it empowers
[2141.84 - 2145.60] you strengthens you and then we'll do
[2143.16 - 2147.56] more than just a magic pill we'll do
[2145.60 - 2150.12] some different foods so first of all
[2147.56 - 2150.92] what not to eat just go to my what not
[2150.12 - 2154.32] to
[2150.92 - 2157.00] eats you know and in in all the
[2154.32 - 2158.60] books and uh that's really a big deal
[2157.00 - 2161.28] that's a big deal for getting rid of
[2158.60 - 2163.16] acid reflux if your animal protein lover
[2161.28 - 2164.80] lower reduce it because you're just
[2163.16 - 2166.92] going to max out your liver with all
[2164.80 - 2169.12] that animal fat and you're going to
[2166.92 - 2171.68] force your liver to produce extra bile
[2169.12 - 2173.00] salts to break down that animal fat and
[2171.68 - 2174.12] you're going to weaken your hydrochloric
[2173.00 - 2175.92] acid because your stomach's going to
[2174.12 - 2177.60] have to overproduce hydrochloric acid
[2175.92 - 2179.48] once again and just exhaust itself kind
[2177.60 - 2180.64] of like adrenals when adrenals get tired
[2179.48 - 2182.16] and all of a sudden you get a bad
[2180.64 - 2183.60] experience it happens to you and then
[2182.16 - 2185.60] your adrenals don't have anything else
[2183.60 - 2187.00] to spit out so they just shoot out
[2185.60 - 2190.28] whatever they got left and they're
[2187.00 - 2192.12] really exhausted you know like when a a
[2190.28 - 2194.56] girlfriend breaks up with a boyfriend or
[2192.12 - 2198.72] a boyfriend breaks up with a girlfriend
[2194.56 - 2201.24] or or anything anything that happens in
[2198.72 - 2202.72] Life or you walked into the office one
[2201.24 - 2203.80] day and someone who's trying to steal
[2202.72 - 2208.32] your job
[2203.80 - 2210.80] is talk to the boss and set you up for a
[2208.32 - 2212.52] fall whatever I've I've seen it all I
[2210.80 - 2214.60] mean it's just it's it's just this world
[2212.52 - 2216.92] is is this world is
[2214.60 - 2218.36] crazy this world is crazy and you know
[2216.92 - 2221.08] next thing you know
[2218.36 - 2223.76] it next thing you know it you got you
[2221.08 - 2225.88] got you know you got you got hit the
[2223.76 - 2226.72] adrenals got hit adrenals got weakened
[2225.88 - 2228.04] well it's the same thing with the
[2226.72 - 2231.20] intestinal tract you dropped too much
[2228.04 - 2233.32] animal protein down too much animal
[2231.20 - 2235.48] protein too much animal fat down in
[2233.32 - 2237.24] there and same thing if you're a vegan
[2235.48 - 2240.04] you drop too much nut fat too much
[2237.24 - 2241.96] coconut oil oh my God I saw somebody eat
[2240.04 - 2243.60] like a half a jar of coconut oil and
[2241.96 - 2244.96] they gave themselves pancreatitis and
[2243.60 - 2247.00] they were a vegan and they gave
[2244.96 - 2248.44] themselves pancreatitis this matter if
[2247.00 - 2250.24] they were a vegan or a meat eater if
[2248.44 - 2252.64] they're a meat eater and drank a whole
[2250.24 - 2254.08] bottle of coconut oil yeah it's possible
[2252.64 - 2256.24] they can give themselves pancreatitis
[2254.08 - 2257.88] too and just for the record meat eaters
[2256.24 - 2260.04] get more pancreatitis than any
[2257.88 - 2261.88] vegetarian or vegan has ever gotten in
[2260.04 - 2263.72] the history of medicine I'm going to say
[2261.88 - 2265.12] that not cuz I'm standing up for vegans
[2263.72 - 2267.32] right now and I'm trying to knock down
[2265.12 - 2268.88] animal protein people that's not it at
[2267.32 - 2270.80] all I'm just telling you right now
[2268.88 - 2272.80] pancreatitis is from animal fats from
[2270.80 - 2276.20] pork more people get pancreatitis from
[2272.80 - 2279.96] pork than anything else anything else
[2276.20 - 2284.16] Bak bacon ham pork roast whatever that
[2279.96 - 2286.76] is pork chops uh ribs more people get
[2284.16 - 2289.32] pancreatitis in cases of pancreatitis
[2286.76 - 2291.48] from all that pork and all that and the
[2289.32 - 2293.60] burgers and all that stuff even if it's
[2291.48 - 2296.32] grass-fed burgers and all that butter on
[2293.60 - 2298.56] their lobster whatever it is more people
[2296.32 - 2300.88] get pancreatitis that way than vegans do
[2298.56 - 2304.20] eating too many nuts or a half a jar of
[2300.88 - 2305.76] coconut oil I've seen meat eaters drink
[2304.20 - 2307.20] a whole bottle of olive oil thinking
[2305.76 - 2309.56] they're going to flush out gallbladder
[2307.20 - 2311.84] and liver which you can't and it doesn't
[2309.56 - 2313.28] work and they do that and they give
[2311.84 - 2315.80] themselves pancreatitis because they
[2313.28 - 2318.24] also had a steak the night before I've
[2315.80 - 2320.28] also seen vegans drop a whole bottle of
[2318.24 - 2322.28] olive oil down and give themselves
[2320.28 - 2324.64] pancreatitis and then the night before
[2322.28 - 2328.00] they had you know a big nut pie so it's
[2324.64 - 2329.96] like seriously like you know whatever
[2328.00 - 2333.16] but the bottom line is
[2329.96 - 2335.04] um you know we got to reduce that animal
[2333.16 - 2337.44] fat if you're in the Animal product
[2335.04 - 2339.76] world and we we just got to reduce the
[2337.44 - 2341.16] fats so that the liver is not
[2339.76 - 2342.68] overburdened if you want your acid
[2341.16 - 2344.32] reflux to go away you want you don't
[2342.68 - 2346.48] want that liver overburdened I'm telling
[2344.32 - 2347.68] you right now if it's overburdened
[2346.48 - 2349.24] what's going to happen is it's going to
[2347.68 - 2350.96] overproduce bile it's going to try to
[2349.24 - 2352.48] make bile so damn strong it's going to
[2350.96 - 2355.88] weaken the liver it's going to push out
[2352.48 - 2357.84] so much bile and when that happens when
[2355.88 - 2360.56] that happens the the liver weakens and
[2357.84 - 2362.60] then what happens the stomach over
[2360.56 - 2364.84] produces the hydrochloric acid it burns
[2362.60 - 2368.00] itself out Burns it out like a
[2364.84 - 2369.84] star Burns it out like a rock star when
[2368.00 - 2372.04] rock stars get burnt
[2369.84 - 2373.60] out and I'm you know I've known a lot of
[2372.04 - 2375.92] rock stars over the years I've helped
[2373.60 - 2378.80] out a lot of rock stars over the years
[2375.92 - 2380.92] and they get all burnt out you know and
[2378.80 - 2384.28] so it's it's and that's what happens
[2380.92 - 2387.36] your hydrochloric acid they you know it
[2384.28 - 2388.80] burns out and so you want to kind of
[2387.36 - 2390.64] restore that so how do we store that
[2388.80 - 2392.44] what do we what do we do what are we
[2390.64 - 2395.84] trying to do well you know I I
[2392.44 - 2397.44] antibacterials don't I mean they we
[2395.84 - 2399.40] shouldn't disc guard them natural ones
[2397.44 - 2401.12] herbal ones a little bit of golden seal
[2399.40 - 2403.72] once in a while will lower a bacterial
[2401.12 - 2405.52] load in the gut a little bit of golden
[2403.72 - 2408.72] seal once in a while little bit of eona
[2405.52 - 2411.36] golden seal it does reduce that little
[2408.72 - 2413.08] bit of Elderberry syrup once in a while
[2411.36 - 2414.76] cats CLW a little bit of cats claw here
[2413.08 - 2417.76] and there if you ever want you can lower
[2414.76 - 2420.56] and reduce that bacterial stuff a little
[2417.76 - 2422.96] bit of oregano oil oregano oil time tea
[2420.56 - 2424.40] time time water time tea the stuff I
[2422.96 - 2427.48] always promote in the books like
[2424.40 - 2429.76] life-changing foods you can you can
[2427.48 - 2432.60] lower you can
[2429.76 - 2435.56] lower the uh bacterial
[2432.60 - 2439.56] load lemon balm lowers the bacterial
[2435.56 - 2441.76] load why does peppermint tea help with
[2439.56 - 2443.88] digestion nobody knows you know I was
[2441.76 - 2446.28] talking to an herbalist a while back too
[2443.88 - 2447.92] a well-known one and they were just like
[2446.28 - 2450.76] I love what you do I love what you do I
[2447.92 - 2451.80] I I I learn a lot even as an herbalist
[2450.76 - 2454.60] you
[2451.80 - 2456.52] know he go let me ask he goes let me ask
[2454.60 - 2458.44] you this question Anthony let me asked
[2456.52 - 2462.04] this gu I'm like what and he's a really
[2458.44 - 2464.92] nice guy really nice guy and he said he
[2462.04 - 2466.68] said peppermint tea peppermint tea you
[2464.92 - 2468.48] know it it it works really good with
[2466.68 - 2469.68] that bacteria in the stomach I'm I'm
[2468.48 - 2471.52] guessing because you're telling me the
[2469.68 - 2474.12] bacteria is the acid reflux so the
[2471.52 - 2477.88] peppermint tea it
[2474.12 - 2479.76] helps with the acid reflux how's that
[2477.88 - 2481.16] possible that is it that I go because
[2479.76 - 2483.00] it's actually knocking down bacteria he
[2481.16 - 2485.24] says no but herbalists know that that's
[2483.00 - 2487.52] not one of the antibacterials peppermint
[2485.24 - 2489.36] te herbalists know that that's not
[2487.52 - 2492.20] really one of the main that's not an
[2489.36 - 2494.72] antiviral antibacterial herb I go yes it
[2492.20 - 2497.68] is it's an antibacterial herb nobody
[2494.72 - 2499.68] knows that it's like I'll be darned I'll
[2497.68 - 2501.80] be darned I'm going to be talking about
[2499.68 - 2504.00] that on my lectures that's what he
[2501.80 - 2505.80] said and you know he's helped a lot of
[2504.00 - 2507.64] people he's helped a lot of people I
[2505.80 - 2510.56] mean just in his whole career being an
[2507.64 - 2513.04] herbalist he's helped a lot of people I
[2510.56 - 2516.32] love herbalists you know the thing is is
[2513.04 - 2519.76] this is that is that is because that
[2516.32 - 2522.56] peppermint alone peppermint tea does
[2519.76 - 2524.20] diminish bacteria certain bacteria in
[2522.56 - 2526.04] the in the gut meaning in the top in the
[2524.20 - 2527.68] stomach in there so that one helps the
[2526.04 - 2529.52] lemon bomb like I said before peppermint
[2527.68 - 2531.40] oregano oil capsules we know that one
[2529.52 - 2534.04] does right olive leaf olive leaf
[2531.40 - 2535.44] capsules olive leaf tinure of the right
[2534.04 - 2536.68] kind make sure you go to you know if
[2535.44 - 2538.92] you're going to get a supplement go to
[2536.68 - 2543.28] medicalmedium.com I don't sell the
[2538.92 - 2545.68] supplement but I but I we created with a
[2543.28 - 2548.64] lot of time and energy exhausting and a
[2545.68 - 2552.68] lot of money involved to create this we
[2548.64 - 2554.72] created a um um a directory for you so
[2552.68 - 2556.80] that you can know what is the right one
[2554.72 - 2558.52] cuz we kept on hearing we we didn't do
[2556.80 - 2560.56] it for a long time but we kept on
[2558.52 - 2562.20] hearing from so many people like I got
[2560.56 - 2563.64] this supplement and I'm not getting
[2562.20 - 2565.68] result because that supplement is
[2563.64 - 2567.28] actually garbage or I got this
[2565.68 - 2568.68] supplement and it just burned my throat
[2567.28 - 2571.92] yeah because it was loaded with citric
[2568.68 - 2574.60] acid or whatever it is so finally we had
[2571.92 - 2578.04] to create a
[2574.60 - 2579.16] directory and that's what we did and uh
[2578.04 - 2580.72] and someone said to me why don't you
[2579.16 - 2581.84] start selling supplements so you can pay
[2580.72 - 2584.32] for some of this stuff I said I'm not
[2581.84 - 2586.68] going to sell supplements I'm not I'm
[2584.32 - 2589.92] not going to do it I just I can't I
[2586.68 - 2591.36] can't something in me I just can't do it
[2589.92 - 2593.32] I said there supplement companies they
[2591.36 - 2595.00] sell them I don't want to do that I'm
[2593.32 - 2596.96] about getting people what they need the
[2595.00 - 2598.64] information they need I got to stay the
[2596.96 - 2602.60] Integrity has to stay
[2598.64 - 2604.92] there you know um so here's the deal
[2602.60 - 2606.56] here's the deal see there's all these
[2604.92 - 2609.20] different things you can take and use to
[2606.56 - 2612.68] knock down that bacteria which is really
[2609.20 - 2615.12] helpful and and we can do
[2612.68 - 2617.16] that and that you know licorice root all
[2615.12 - 2618.68] on it all on its own actually does that
[2617.16 - 2621.84] too licorice root knocks down some
[2618.68 - 2624.64] bacteria in fact licorice
[2621.84 - 2625.96] root is like a miracle for acid reflux
[2624.64 - 2627.92] because it's knocking down so much
[2625.96 - 2630.36] bacteria and also viruses in the
[2627.92 - 2633.04] intestinal tract but it's knocking down
[2630.36 - 2636.04] so much bacteria licorice root licorice
[2633.04 - 2638.08] tea licorice peppermint tea is a godsend
[2636.04 - 2640.12] for acid reflux why it's knocking down

[2640.12 - 2645.60] guys bacteria that creates the bad acid
[2644.04 - 2647.36] and if you've heard that before it came
[2645.60 - 2649.28] from me originally I'm saying that
[2647.36 - 2651.36] because I have to keep it straight with
[2649.28 - 2653.80] with with honoring spirit that put the
[2651.36 - 2655.56] information out there A lot of times for
[2653.80 - 2657.56] years I put a lot of information out
[2655.56 - 2659.52] there I taught a lot of people through
[2657.56 - 2662.16] spirit's wisdom not through my wisdom
[2659.52 - 2664.00] spirit's wisdom and stuff did get around
[2662.16 - 2666.08] and if you say oh I think I heard that
[2664.00 - 2668.08] before well trust me that one came from
[2666.08 - 2670.56] spirit I have to always honor spirit
[2668.08 - 2672.80] Spirit doesn't care Spirit doesn't care
[2670.56 - 2674.52] I just I care about honoring spirit I
[2672.80 - 2677.12] just I have that kind of respect for
[2674.52 - 2680.04] spirit so you know here's the
[2677.12 - 2682.96] deal um celery juice now we can do the
[2680.04 - 2685.40] food celery juice is critical aloe vera
[2682.96 - 2688.20] water aloe vera gel you can scoop it out
[2685.40 - 2690.92] the leaf and eat it if you want I
[2688.20 - 2692.68] remember I was traveling one time and I
[2690.92 - 2696.60] told my assistant I said get me an aloe
[2692.68 - 2697.96] vera leaf get me an aloe vera leaf
[2696.60 - 2700.28] and she was like okay I'll get you one
[2697.96 - 2701.76] and she got me a bunch of them and you
[2700.28 - 2703.20] know and I was around a bunch of people
[2701.76 - 2705.32] at the time I was around a bunch of
[2703.20 - 2707.16] people people that weren't you know they
[2705.32 - 2708.68] knew who I was but they they weren't
[2707.16 - 2712.08] used to being with
[2708.68 - 2713.76] me and everybody was you know getting
[2712.08 - 2716.84] their food out we were having lunch and
[2713.76 - 2719.16] all that and I grabbed a leaf an Al of
[2716.84 - 2723.36] leaf I cracked it open and I took a
[2719.16 - 2725.36] spoon I sliced it open so it was It was
[2723.36 - 2727.80] kind of open where I I then took a spoon
[2725.36 - 2729.36] and I divided at the flaps and I just
[2727.80 - 2730.96] scraped inside the leaf and I just ate
[2729.36 - 2734.12] the whole Alo leaf that was my lunch
[2730.96 - 2735.72] that day and everybody looked at me like
[2734.12 - 2737.52] like even though they knew of course and
[2735.72 - 2738.84] they know and everything else and there
[2737.52 - 2741.84] that's the whole point I mean they knew
[2738.84 - 2743.40] if they're me you know with me they knew
[2741.84 - 2744.64] but they were still so surprised I'm
[2743.40 - 2746.48] like why are you surprised they're like
[2744.64 - 2749.00] what I just never seen anybody do that
[2746.48 - 2750.80] for lunch I go yeah I'm doing that
[2749.00 - 2752.96] because the flu it's flu season right
[2750.80 - 2755.44] now it's flu season people have
[2752.96 - 2757.08] pneumonia out there it's flu season it's
[2755.44 - 2759.60] traveling I was hopping on a plane on
[2757.08 - 2762.24] and off planes or whatever and you know
[2759.60 - 2765.20] what this Alo does it kills bacteria and
[2762.24 - 2768.24] it kills viruses so if I happen to
[2765.20 - 2770.04] accidentally ingest or inhale a a neuro
[2768.24 - 2772.08] virus which is a flu virus which is a
[2770.04 - 2774.64] stomach flu virus and it gets on my
[2772.08 - 2776.28] tongue and it goes down my throat and
[2774.64 - 2778.36] gets to my stomach and fires up the
[2776.28 - 2779.92] worst stomach flu ever I got some aloe
[2778.36 - 2782.44] sitting down all around in there and
[2779.92 - 2785.32] that's bacterial and viral
[2782.44 - 2787.44] killing that's why people's acid reflux
[2785.32 - 2789.32] drops
[2787.44 - 2792.60] substantially
[2789.32 - 2794.72] substantially when you use aloe water or

[2986.28 - 2990.24] to stay away from fruit it's bad n your
[2988.80 - 2991.44] practitioner is only telling you that
[2990.24 - 2992.60] because he heard it from somebody else
[2991.44 - 2994.28] he heard it from somewhere else and I
[2992.60 - 2996.48] know where the original Source came 11
[2994.28 - 2998.92] years ago from a doctor that brought it
[2996.48 - 3000.52] into the industry because it was to sell
[2998.92 - 3003.32] his fruit pills he didn't want people
[3000.52 - 3005.92] eating fruit I remember the day it
[3003.32 - 3008.80] happened and it's just spread like
[3005.92 - 3010.52] wildfire and now clinics even say in the
[3008.80 - 3013.72] health world oh fruit's bad it'll feed
[3010.52 - 3017.32] cancer no it doesn't fruit doesn't feed
[3013.72 - 3021.04] cancer corn syrup feeds cancer processed
[3017.32 - 3024.24] table sugar feeds cancer beet meaning
[3021.04 - 3026.64] GMO beet sugar feeds cancer beet
[3024.24 - 3029.28] processed GMO sugar
[3026.64 - 3031.20] um Dairy feeds cancer eggs feed cancer
[3029.28 - 3033.00] like no tomorrow they grow fibroids they
[3031.20 - 3035.72] grow tumors they grow benign tumors
[3033.00 - 3038.28] benign cysts they grow eggs grow tumors
[3035.72 - 3040.44] of all kinds cancers of all kinds feed
[3038.28 - 3042.72] everything under the sun as eggs they
[3040.44 - 3047.24] kept cancer alive in Labs back in the
[3042.72 - 3049.64] 1950s by putting eggs in with them
[3047.24 - 3051.08] Christ but yet no but you know they all
[3049.64 - 3052.40] be like oh fruit will feed cancer it
[3051.08 - 3054.56] doesn't feed cancer you know what fruit
[3052.40 - 3057.60] does it kills bacteria that causes acid
[3054.56 - 3061.88] reflux you just can't eat a fruit
[3057.60 - 3063.68] pie on top of a steak the body fights
[3061.88 - 3065.32] itself cuz the fruit just wants to do
[3063.68 - 3067.80] right while the steak wants to just do
[3065.32 - 3070.48] wrong not saying you can quit steak if
[3067.80 - 3073.60] you're a steak eater I'm just saying I
[3070.48 - 3075.20] can't put the two together the fruit is
[3073.60 - 3077.76] a bacterial
[3075.20 - 3079.48] killer and it wants to rush through your
[3077.76 - 3081.32] stomach through your dadum through your
[3079.48 - 3082.68] intestinal tract it wants to rush
[3081.32 - 3084.08] through it wants to push through it
[3082.68 - 3086.12] wants to drive all the way through and
[3084.08 - 3088.52] it wants to kill everything shouldn't be
[3086.12 - 3091.16] there and save everything that should be
[3088.52 - 3094.84] there so when I hear misinformation it
[3091.16 - 3096.44] drives me insane it drives me insane I
[3094.84 - 3097.92] mean when you hear the misinformation
[3096.44 - 3100.68] that's been out there and rampant and
