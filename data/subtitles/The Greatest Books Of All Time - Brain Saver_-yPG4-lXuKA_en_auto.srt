and SOC and aw and medical mean for

802
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:24,059

00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,919
Community doesn't take the information

804
00:32:24,059 --> 00:32:27,360

sick and everything out there

809
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:36,539

00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:38,159
costs to ship and print paper this big

811
00:32:36,539 --> 00:32:40,380

is smart enough

814
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:45,720
they're smart enough to know that it's

815
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:47,520

816
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:49,860

00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:11,520
actually rewriting things as if they did

930

00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,940
it's incredible how Sinister the world

932
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:17,220
really is

933
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:19,020
and yes things get forgotten and they

934
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:20,160
get forgotten even in like a five-year

935
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:22,320
clip

936
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:24,000
three-year clip and then there's all

937
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:25,680
these new people you know and boom

938
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,480
there's these new people trying to sell

939
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:30,240

940
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:32,700
they just started eating better and

941
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:34,500
and everybody forgets like where were

942
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:35,940
they five years ago it's just crazy how

943
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:37,680
it works yeah I know it's not making

944
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:38,940
total sense because you have there's so

945
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,980
much to talk about with that but believe

946
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:43,560
me there's so much

947
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:45,420
so I mean just symptoms and conditions

948
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:50,520
right here

949
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:52,200
and it's endless humidity sensitivity

950
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:53,579
right and I talk about all this what I'm

951
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:55,619
talking about inside the book heat

952
00:37:53,579 --> 00:37:57,800
sensitivity

953
00:37:55,619 --> 00:37:59,880
hunting hens disease

954
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:01,859
hyperpigmentation how many people are

955
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:05,460
dealing with hyperpigmentation impulse

956
00:38:01,859 --> 00:38:08,880
control issues inflammatory myopathy and

957
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:10,320
influenza inner ear disease insomnia it

958
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,300
keeps on going

959
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:14,280
there's so much here muscle weakness

960
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:18,079
muscle spasms when you go in here

961
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:22,680
there's over 300 symptoms conditions

962
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:25,680
and I explain in detail so many of them

963
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:28,740
Casey says which book will have info on

964
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:31,380
cyclic vomiting syndrome for children

965
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:33,839
pick up pick up both books is what I

966
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:37,079
recommend for everybody because they're

967
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:41,460
both they were one book one giant book

968
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:43,619
and I we couldn't publish it we could

969
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:45,660
it was one giant book it was impossible

970
00:38:43,619 --> 00:38:47,760
for the printer to print it out

971
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:50,400
and it couldn't be published

972
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:52,619
had to break them into two

973
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:55,440
massive books

974
00:38:52,619 --> 00:38:56,880
how to break them into two so just so

975
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:59,579
you know

976
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:01,680
getting both books is is really critical

977
00:38:59,579 --> 00:39:03,599
sure you can start with one and then

978
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:05,700
eventually get the other if you'd like

979
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:09,060
but I recommend getting them both

980
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:12,599
because they were one huge big book

981
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:15,720
and it's just how it rolled when you're

982
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:17,040
trying to help heal people with chronic

983
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:20,640
illness

984
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:22,680
and you're trying to understand

985
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:25,380
what they're going through

986
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:27,780
and you're trying to do them Justice you

987
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:31,020
can't make pamphlets eat better books

988
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:32,820
that are just so many pages

989
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:34,560
and they're basically just eat better

990
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:35,820
books that are pamphlets and then start

991
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:38,520
up a podcast and now you're an eat

992
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:41,700
better doctor you can't on a podcast you

993
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:44,700
can't insult the chronically ill

994
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:45,900
and then bring on guests that

995
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:47,820
don't know what they're talking about

996
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:49,560
about chronic illness it's like you have

997
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:52,500
to treat The Chronic allele with the

998
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:53,700
utmost critical respect possible and you

999
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:55,440
have to understand what they've gone

1000
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:57,420
through and you have to make sure you

1001
00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:00,920
have answers for them

1002
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:05,339
and so I couldn't make a brain saver

1003
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:07,380
pamphlet brain saver small book I had to

1004
00:40:05,339 --> 00:40:09,420
make sure that we're talking about the

1005
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:13,640
brain comprehensive detail information

1006
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:13,640
and answers have to be there

1007
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:17,520
so both the books are critical I'm

1008
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:18,599
giving you guys just to run down right

1009
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:21,119
now

1010
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:22,920

00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:25,020

1012
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:26,700

1037
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:26,599
for not running advertisements in front

1038
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:26,599
of my YouTube

1039
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:31,980

suffering and struggling and sick it's

1042

not about always Banking and it's also

1043
00:41:37,619 --> 00:41:40,160
not about

1044
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:46,859
you know all merch and merch and merch

1045
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:50,220
I put up all the free info it's free

1046
00:41:46,859 --> 00:41:52,020
it's not for me to create

1047
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:54,720
all this content

1048
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:59,579
to run a website it is literally content

1049
00:41:54,720 --> 00:42:00,839
that's only for you guys and it's free

1050
00:41:59,579 --> 00:42:02,160
so

1051
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:03,720
I saw a question what about children

1052
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:06,240
take the brain saver books to your

1053
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:09,660
doctor ask your pediatrician if if

1054
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:11,220
they're right for your child absolutely

1055
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:12,780
take the brain saver books to your

1056
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:16,800
doctor your practitioner your health

1057
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:19,800
care provider your pediatrician

1058
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:23,579
it cost me a tremendous amount of money

1059
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:25,920
to create and build the website for you

1060
00:42:23,579 --> 00:42:28,320
guys to create build the website and not

1061
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:30,960
have a firewall to pay all the help

1062
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:34,440
so here's how it works you build up a

1063
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:36,119
website you run a big firewall a paywall

1064
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:38,820
you charge everybody for subscription

1065
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:40,260
fees and courses and everything else so

1066
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:42,060
you can pay the people who work for you

1067
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:45,240
and you can pay yourself and get rich or

1068
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:47,339
whatever I refuse to make paywalls in

1069
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:49,320
