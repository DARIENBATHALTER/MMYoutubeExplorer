[1049.68 - 1054.72] here this is fat-free hummus
[1053.36 - 1057.52] all right
[1054.72 - 1060.56] so you don't have to you worry about the
[1057.52 - 1062.32] weight gaining too right because that's
[1060.56 - 1064.80] a thing everybody's like oh i'm gaining
[1062.32 - 1067.92] weight well how much oil how much fat is
[1064.80 - 1070.24] in your diet that you have going on
[1067.92 - 1070.24] right
[1070.64 - 1075.20] so this is like
[1072.48 - 1075.20] guilt-free
[1075.76 - 1080.40] but it's not just that
[1077.44 - 1082.00] it's also this is isn't it this isn't
[1080.40 - 1083.76] just that it's not about guilt-free or
[1082.00 - 1085.92] anything it's about keeping your fats
[1083.76 - 1088.16] down so your body can heal so if you're
[1085.92 - 1089.84] somebody who's chronically ill right if
[1088.16 - 1091.36] you're somebody who's chronically ill
[1089.84 - 1093.52] someone who's sick someone who's
[1091.36 - 1096.00] struggling keeping the fats low is one
[1093.52 - 1097.76] of the ways we move forward because you
[1096.00 - 1100.32] don't bog down the liver you don't bog
[1097.76 - 1102.24] down the immune system so this is a way
[1100.32 - 1104.56] to actually heal this is that's why i
[1102.24 - 1106.84] call this machine these machines medical
[1104.56 - 1111.20] devices medical machines
[1106.84 - 1111.20] okay and that's what's so great about it
[1117.35 - 1120.08] [Music]
[1118.40 - 1123.84] i don't know what that means let me see
[1120.08 - 1123.84] here put this over here
[1124.00 - 1126.56] there we go
[1126.72 - 1131.40] so i got this beautiful hummus right
[1128.40 - 1131.40] here
[1138.96 - 1143.68] how is this better than humans made with
[1141.52 - 1147.20] a blender are hummus made with a blender
[1143.68 - 1150.00] is elizabeth's saying how is this better
[1147.20 - 1151.28] than hummus made with a blender all
[1150.00 - 1153.52] right so you can make hummus with a
[1151.28 - 1157.20] blender there's no question but when you
[1153.52 - 1158.56] do fat free hummus it's hard to get it
[1157.20 - 1160.72] smooth
[1158.56 - 1162.64] it's hard to get it smooth and creamy so
[1160.72 - 1164.48] what you have here when you have this
[1162.64 - 1167.44] machine the difference is you can get it
[1164.48 - 1169.76] smooth and creamy and this is fat free
[1167.44 - 1172.16] so there's no oil in here
[1169.76 - 1173.92] but yet it's smooth and creamy
[1172.16 - 1175.52] that's the difference between getting in
[1173.92 - 1177.44] a blender when you put in the blender
[1175.52 - 1179.12] you have to add a big hunk of tahini in
[1177.44 - 1181.44] there too like that's something people
[1179.12 - 1183.84] do to try to get it that kind of creamy
[1181.44 - 1185.84] texture when you're doing the blender
[1183.84 - 1187.76] you don't have to do that this way
[1185.84 - 1192.00] literally we just put the garbanzo beans
[1187.76 - 1194.24] the chickpeas right into the machine
[1192.00 - 1196.88] and you didn't have the oil you didn't
[1194.24 - 1198.80] have all that tahini or olive oil you
[1196.88 - 1200.88] know what happens people put ounces and
[1198.80 - 1203.92] ounces of olive oil in their hummus at
[1200.88 - 1205.20] least the restaurants do you sit down
[1203.92 - 1208.00] you know you sit down in the restaurant
[1205.20 - 1209.68] you're like yeah can i order a hummus
[1208.00 - 1211.84] okay sure yes you can bring me some
[1209.68 - 1214.24] crackers too okay thank you they dropped
[1211.84 - 1218.84] the hummus down you wouldn't believe how
[1214.24 - 1221.36] much olive oil or canola oil is in that
[1218.84 - 1224.40] hummus if you couldn't imagine how much
[1221.36 - 1225.92] is in there so that's the whole thing so
[1224.40 - 1229.12] it's important to know that this is
[1225.92 - 1230.88] creamy and smooth this was pulverized in
[1229.12 - 1233.36] such an incredible way that that's the
[1230.88 - 1235.60] difference right there
[1233.36 - 1236.56] so i hope that answers the question
[1235.60 - 1238.56] right
[1236.56 - 1242.16] link is in the profile link is in the
[1238.56 - 1245.12] description this is the mm-1500
[1242.16 - 1246.56] it's 80 off really incredible so what
[1245.12 - 1248.16] i'm going to do is put this in here for
[1246.56 - 1250.32] a second if you guys don't mind right
[1248.16 - 1250.32] here
[1250.48 - 1254.16] so here we go
[1252.08 - 1256.56] you got your hummus
[1254.16 - 1258.48] you've got your crudite you've got your
[1256.56 - 1260.16] crackers right here you can have a nice
[1258.48 - 1261.28] cracker you can dip it in your hummus
[1260.16 - 1262.88] like that
[1261.28 - 1264.96] there you go you got your crackers you
[1262.88 - 1266.32] got your carrots you got your radishes
[1264.96 - 1268.00] you can take a little bit of a radish
[1266.32 - 1269.68] right there
[1268.00 - 1271.68] it's really good
[1269.68 - 1272.88] no stoner jokes
[1271.68 - 1275.88] it's really good
[1272.88 - 1275.88] right
[1276.40 - 1279.68] so that's something you can do
[1281.52 - 1284.00] all right
[1282.48 - 1285.12] we're moving on to the next one we're
[1284.00 - 1287.12] making some
[1285.12 - 1289.12] green juice
[1287.12 - 1291.84] we're making some serious juice we're
[1289.12 - 1291.84] doing that now
[1293.20 - 1296.16] excited about this
[1296.48 - 1298.96] all right so
[1299.12 - 1303.04] we're going to talk about celery for a
[1300.32 - 1305.84] couple of seconds right
[1303.04 - 1305.84] now
[1306.24 - 1310.24] when it comes down to celery juice
[1310.48 - 1314.32] to get celery to do its thing and move
[1312.88 - 1316.64] the needle
[1314.32 - 1318.48] okay to get celery to do its thing and
[1316.64 - 1321.28] move the needle you guys
[1318.48 - 1324.24] it has to be by itself it's herbal
[1321.28 - 1327.60] medicine you juice on its own
[1324.24 - 1328.48] but you can also use celery
[1327.60 - 1330.56] as
[1328.48 - 1332.80] a carrier
[1330.56 - 1334.88] and that's a different situation
[1332.80 - 1337.76] so what we're doing is we're making a
[1334.88 - 1340.16] kale juice right now
[1337.76 - 1341.84] but we're going to use the trace mineral
[1340.16 - 1344.40] salts and celery
[1341.84 - 1346.64] to become the carrier for phytochemical
[1344.40 - 1348.56] compounds
[1346.64 - 1351.28] from the kale
[1348.56 - 1353.04] to go deep into the liver and so forth
[1351.28 - 1354.96] all right
[1353.04 - 1356.56] so that's important to know so let's do
[1354.96 - 1358.48] it so we're not just sitting here making
[1356.56 - 1360.16] celery juice you do your celery juice in
[1358.48 - 1363.36] the morning that's what i do i do in the
[1360.16 - 1365.12] morning empty stomach 32 ounces that's
[1363.36 - 1367.36] what i do
[1365.12 - 1369.04] the end of the day this is an option for
[1367.36 - 1371.68] people at the end of the day where we
[1369.04 - 1374.64] now do a kale juice but we're making
[1371.68 - 1376.24] sure celery is the carrier so let's get
[1374.64 - 1377.68] moving on if you guys just got on here
[1376.24 - 1379.76] we made a sorbet because i see new
[1377.68 - 1382.48] people coming on we got a sorbet right

[1396.40 - 1400.24] hummus
[1397.44 - 1403.12] with this machine now we're making kale
[1400.24 - 1404.48] celery juice
[1403.12 - 1406.56] let's do it
[1404.48 - 1408.00] we're on
[1406.56 - 1411.24] so i'm gonna run some kale through here
[1408.00 - 1411.24] right now

[1446.40 - 1451.20] can we add an apple to the kale and
[1448.40 - 1453.60] celery does that reduce the nutrition
[1451.20 - 1456.24] you can add an apple to it because
[1453.60 - 1459.24] you're not doing celery by itself

[1487.20 - 1489.44] okay
[1492.72 - 1499.12] i'm using the trace mineral salts in
[1494.96 - 1501.60] celery which is an herb to carry
[1499.12 - 1504.48] the phytochemical compounds
[1501.60 - 1504.48] of the kale

[1552.56 - 1556.48] silly and everything and then next thing
[1554.40 - 1558.56] you know what i'm i'm like
[1556.48 - 1559.44] somewhere else check this out okay you
[1558.56 - 1560.72] guys
[1559.44 - 1562.80] all right
[1560.72 - 1564.64] what you're doing is
[1562.80 - 1566.40] you're you're you're using herbal
[1564.64 - 1567.76] medicine so this is important to know
[1566.40 - 1569.28] for so many people here when you're
[1567.76 - 1570.48] dealing with celery you're dealing with
[1569.28 - 1572.72] herbal medicine
[1570.48 - 1575.04] herbal medicine that's easy on the body
[1572.72 - 1578.16] easy on the system easy on the
[1575.04 - 1580.32] intestinal tract lining easy on
[1578.16 - 1582.08] everything this is different when we go
[1580.32 - 1583.68] and try to take all this crazy stuff
[1582.08 - 1585.44] that someone recommends and we try to
[1583.68 - 1587.52] take something else and we just burn a
[1585.44 - 1589.44] hole through our gut
[1587.52 - 1592.32] that's not what this is right this is
[1589.44 - 1595.12] herbal medicine that really turns things
[1592.32 - 1596.72] around inside of us but we're using this
[1595.12 - 1600.40] herbal medicine
[1596.72 - 1601.84] to do something for us we're using this
[1600.40 - 1604.64] okay
[1601.84 - 1607.68] right we're using this to do something
[1604.64 - 1608.64] to give us something else so what we're
[1607.68 - 1611.36] doing
[1608.64 - 1615.04] is we're using the celery
[1611.36 - 1618.00] to bind onto
[1615.04 - 1620.24] to carry phytochemical compounds in that
[1618.00 - 1622.80] leafy green so you're looking at those
[1620.24 - 1624.96] leafy greens
[1622.80 - 1627.84] that's what that's what we're doing
[1624.96 - 1627.84] it's important to know
[1627.92 - 1631.04] and i want to show you about this how
[1629.36 - 1634.64] the juicer works a little bit too with
[1631.04 - 1636.80] this you're seeing dry pulp come out
[1634.64 - 1639.60] see that's dry that's because this has a
[1636.80 - 1642.72] celery end cap so you're seeing the dry
[1639.60 - 1645.52] pulp come out just like the mm-900
[1642.72 - 1647.76] which is my favorite juicer the mm-900
[1645.52 - 1649.68] but you're seeing the dry pulp come out
[1647.76 - 1652.00] and tick-tock
[1649.68 - 1653.60] the reason why this is the twilight zone
[1652.00 - 1656.96] right now is because that pulp is
[1653.60 - 1659.04] supposed to be so sloppy wet
[1656.96 - 1661.92] that it's supposed to even be filling
[1659.04 - 1666.16] juice in that container and that's money
[1661.92 - 1667.28] out the door money out the window
[1666.16 - 1669.76] sandy says where do you find the
[1667.28 - 1671.28] discount for the m for the 1500 hit the
[1669.76 - 1672.88] link right there link is in the
[1671.28 - 1674.16] description
[1672.88 - 1675.28] well right where it takes you to there
[1674.16 - 1678.80] it should show you how much you've
[1675.28 - 1678.80] gotten off 80 off
[1679.68 - 1683.84] so i'm running some more kale through
[1681.52 - 1683.84] here
[1684.00 - 1688.48] so you're witnessing
[1685.84 - 1690.40] you're witnessing dry pulp coming out of
[1688.48 - 1693.12] this machine
[1690.40 - 1694.56] that's dollars going in your pocket
[1693.12 - 1696.64] right there so that's dollars going in
[1694.56 - 1698.96] your pocket the one thing about the mm
[1696.64 - 1701.28] 1500 and the mm-900 is they pay for
[1698.96 - 1703.68] themselves over time they actually pay
[1701.28 - 1705.76] for themselves and that's the difference
[1703.68 - 1708.76] with these two machines they pay for
[1705.76 - 1708.76] themselves
[1711.52 - 1714.72] so we're running a little bit more
[1712.88 - 1717.04] celery through here we're running kale
[1714.72 - 1718.80] through here i'm running a celery stick
[1717.04 - 1719.60] in here then i'm running kale through
[1718.80 - 1722.40] here
[1719.60 - 1726.48] and i'm doing a blend right here
[1722.40 - 1729.52] i'm using the celery herb
[1726.48 - 1732.16] the herb as a carrier
[1729.52 - 1733.84] and what you're seeing is dry pulp
[1732.16 - 1735.84] popping out
[1733.84 - 1737.12] another thing
[1735.84 - 1739.04] you're seeing
[1737.12 - 1741.92] is there isn't metal
[1739.04 - 1744.56] now all involved in there like the other
[1741.92 - 1747.52] juicers were all that metal particles
[1744.56 - 1749.76] from the metal gears doing this and
[1747.52 - 1753.20] central fuse all the metal you're not
[1749.76 - 1754.08] seeing that either which is amazing
[1753.20 - 1756.32] all right
[1754.08 - 1756.32] so
[1756.40 - 1759.52] we're running kale we're running some
[1758.00 - 1761.36] celery through here
[1759.52 - 1762.80] now you're seeing that dry pulp come out
[1761.36 - 1764.96] right you guys
[1762.80 - 1768.96] there it is now listen don't get me
[1764.96 - 1771.52] wrong you can take the mm-900
[1768.96 - 1776.16] and still run kale
[1771.52 - 1776.16] and cilantro with your celery through it
[1778.56 - 1784.00] here we go but here's the thing with
[1781.20 - 1785.52] inflation and food costs
[1784.00 - 1786.72] this is helping
[1785.52 - 1789.84] that's what i love about it with
[1786.72 - 1792.32] inflation and food costs
[1789.84 - 1794.24] cosmic alchemist hey how are you i see
[1792.32 - 1795.36] you always leave a comment once
[1794.24 - 1797.12] on
[1795.36 - 1799.60] youtube
[1797.12 - 1803.20] now whole foods organic celery price
[1799.60 - 1805.68] inflation from 1.79 to 299 i save a
[1803.20 - 1808.32] bunch of money using the mm juicer
[1805.68 - 1810.96] that's the whole point food costs go up
[1808.32 - 1814.00] the juicer is extracting more
[1810.96 - 1815.04] it's less there's less moisture in the
[1814.00 - 1816.32] pulp
[1815.04 - 1818.88] so i'm going to show you how that works
[1816.32 - 1821.52] too in a second you guys
[1818.88 - 1823.68] so let me shut this down for a minute
[1821.52 - 1825.04] okay so let's let's just show you how
[1823.68 - 1826.72] this works
[1825.04 - 1828.56] so that's the pulp
[1826.72 - 1830.80] now with other juicers here's what goes
[1828.56 - 1832.72] wrong right here right
[1830.80 - 1837.16] i'm gonna take the pull belt
[1832.72 - 1837.16] right i'm gonna take the pulp out
[1838.72 - 1842.96] you don't see
[1840.88 - 1844.72] any any liquid dumping out do you see
[1842.96 - 1846.88] any liquid dumping out in my hand i'm
[1844.72 - 1848.56] trying to get a spot here it's like i'm
[1846.88 - 1851.12] okay here we are
[1848.56 - 1852.40] it's like a it's like being in a fun
[1851.12 - 1853.60] house right you're walking around you
[1852.40 - 1854.80] see like
[1853.60 - 1856.40] it's like you don't know where you are
[1854.80 - 1858.00] but check this out right here
[1856.40 - 1859.28] trying to get lined up with the camera
[1858.00 - 1861.20] if you guys see this you don't see
[1859.28 - 1862.96] liquid coming out of my hand
[1861.20 - 1864.48] is someone trying to read my spirit said
[1862.96 - 1865.84] someone's trying to read my palm
[1864.48 - 1867.44] unbelievable
[1865.84 - 1869.04] that's interesting
[1867.44 - 1871.68] spirit of compassion just told me that
[1869.04 - 1874.88] someone out there is actually trying to
[1871.68 - 1877.84] read my bomb lines
[1874.88 - 1880.00] i know i never had that happen
[1877.84 - 1882.16] you're probably a gifted palm reader too
[1880.00 - 1884.56] just just don't just don't see anything
[1882.16 - 1886.08] in my palm that's scary please like you
[1884.56 - 1889.20] know what i mean like they're finally
[1886.08 - 1891.36] gonna they're finally gonna get them
[1889.20 - 1893.36] they're finally gonna get them
[1891.36 - 1895.04] or he's gonna work himself to death and
[1893.36 - 1896.96] then he's just he's gonna die because
[1895.04 - 1898.56] he's gonna he's gonna work himself to
[1896.96 - 1901.60] the point where he burns a candle six
[1898.56 - 1903.68] ends seven eight ends instead of one end
[1901.60 - 1905.12] both ends all right
[1903.68 - 1907.60] so the point is you don't see liquid
[1905.12 - 1911.60] coming out
[1907.60 - 1913.20] someone was trying to read my palm lines
[1911.60 - 1915.52] that's what spirit of compassion just
[1913.20 - 1917.60] said and i'm impressed that was that was
[1915.52 - 1918.84] smart that was smart of someone trying
[1917.60 - 1921.68] to do that
[1918.84 - 1924.08] okay so what you're seeing in my palm
[1921.68 - 1927.20] now is you're seeing pulp
[1924.08 - 1930.88] that's drier than the other juicers that
[1927.20 - 1933.84] means you get more of that celery juice
[1930.88 - 1936.48] more of that kale juice
[1933.84 - 1938.96] that's when you buy kale and you squeeze
[1936.48 - 1940.56] every last bit out of it to use it as
[1938.96 - 1942.72] medicine someone said i'll just eat the
[1940.56 - 1944.40] kale leaf okay that's smart you eat one
[1942.72 - 1946.72] kale leaf two carrot leaves four kilo
[1944.40 - 1948.32] leaves five but that's not gonna cut it
[1946.72 - 1950.56] you're not going to extract what you
[1948.32 - 1953.20] need to extract out of that kale like
[1950.56 - 1954.96] you can with the juicer right
[1953.20 - 1956.48] but here's the thing this is such a
[1954.96 - 1958.72] pulverizer this is a cold pressed
[1956.48 - 1960.64] machine with such a pulverizer that
[1958.72 - 1962.48] you're getting that out of there
[1960.64 - 1964.08] right and you see there's no liquid
[1962.48 - 1965.60] pouring into my hand and i've seen some
[1964.08 - 1967.92] juicers out there with just it's almost
[1965.60 - 1968.80] like what
[1967.92 - 1970.72] so
[1968.80 - 1972.96] w smith said there's no link for the
[1970.72 - 1974.64] juicer juicers the link should be in the
[1972.96 - 1977.72] description i'm pretty sure link is in
[1974.64 - 1981.68] the description and it's the mm-1500
[1977.72 - 1983.28] megajuicers.com mm-1500
[1981.68 - 1985.12] i wonder what someone's thinking when
[1983.28 - 1987.52] they're trying to read my pump they're
[1985.12 - 1990.52] probably like whoa
[1987.52 - 1990.52] whoa
[1992.80 - 1996.56] yeah okay so we got it we got it we're
[1994.96 - 1998.48] going to move on we got a lot to cover
[1996.56 - 2002.08] right now so that's what we have to do
[1998.48 - 2003.76] so let's get moving on a little bit
[2002.08 - 2006.64] so i'm going to get this juice in a
[2003.76 - 2006.64] container now
[2008.24 - 2010.48] right
[2010.64 - 2014.88] spirit of compassion also said someone's
[2012.32 - 2016.08] falling asleep on me right now
[2014.88 - 2017.92] someone's watching and they're falling
[2016.08 - 2020.08] asleep they didn't sleep good last night
[2017.92 - 2022.00] and they're falling asleep right now
[2020.08 - 2024.88] maybe i can tell a bedtime story well
[2022.00 - 2024.88] there once was
[2026.32 - 2031.20] there was a magical lake
[2028.80 - 2032.40] in that magical lake a whole bunch of
[2031.20 - 2034.16] mermaids
[2032.40 - 2037.68] were swimming out
[2034.16 - 2040.16] and then a sea monster came along
[2037.68 - 2040.16] and then
[2042.32 - 2047.64] but somebody's falling asleep okay there
[2044.08 - 2047.64] we go we got

[2067.60 - 2071.36] different way i used it as a carrier
[2070.32 - 2072.72] to
[2071.36 - 2074.72] okay
[2072.72 - 2076.64] hold on to the phytochemical
[2074.72 - 2078.00] phytochemical compounds of the kale and
[2076.64 - 2082.16] to carry that

[2328.56 - 2331.52] he got mad at me because he wasn't
[2330.24 - 2333.44] wearing socks and the reason why he knew
[2331.52 - 2334.56] he wasn't wearing socks
[2333.44 - 2336.08] is because i was on the phone with him
[2334.56 - 2337.92] in spirit of compassion told me he
[2336.08 - 2339.28] wasn't wearing socks
[2337.92 - 2341.44] so he's sitting there asking me for a
[2339.28 - 2343.36] job i said when's the last time you had
[2341.44 - 2344.72] socks on
[2343.36 - 2346.72] i mean i get it there's a lot of guys

[2346.72 - 2349.84] to wear they like to wear whatever
[2348.40 - 2351.20] birkenstocks or sandals and i totally

[2362.96 - 2366.40] smokes weed every day he smokes weed on
[2364.88 - 2367.68] the couch
[2366.40 - 2368.80] and i said to him i said you want to
[2367.68 - 2371.36] work for me the first thing you got to
[2368.80 - 2372.32] do is put your damn socks on
[2371.36 - 2374.56] and then
[2372.32 - 2375.44] take a shower and then

[2578.64 - 2585.28] a really a nice person came up
[2582.16 - 2588.48] out of the crowd and said
[2585.28 - 2590.64] you know like to get a reading
[2588.48 - 2592.96] and spirit of compassion said the person
[2590.64 - 2595.68] had msg deposits
[2592.96 - 2596.80] in their brain causing problems with
[2595.68 - 2600.24] their head
[2596.80 - 2601.92] causing severe problems
[2600.24 - 2607.84] and then she said

[2770.72 - 2774.00] much fat is in almond milk well here's
[2772.24 - 2776.00] the problem almond milk is in the store
[2774.00 - 2779.12] they add oil to it
[2776.00 - 2782.08] to enrich in it so they add oil to the
[2779.12 - 2784.48] almond milk you buy in the store
[2782.08 - 2786.24] so that's added oil which is leading us
[2784.48 - 2787.84] to the next place
[2786.24 - 2789.76] we're gonna make
[2787.84 - 2791.60] some roasted almond butter

[2855.84 - 2860.08] all right
[2857.28 - 2861.60] so when it comes down to the roasted
[2860.08 - 2865.44] almond butter
[2861.60 - 2865.44] someone left a comment
[2866.32 - 2869.76] by the way tomorrow's the last day for
[2867.84 - 2870.88] the sale right here someone left a
[2869.76 - 2873.04] common nice
[2870.88 - 2874.88] a nice person
[2873.04 - 2876.00] left a comment
[2874.88 - 2878.40] and said
[2876.00 - 2881.28] well wait a minute now
[2878.40 - 2882.96] all that all the oil you see in the nut
[2881.28 - 2885.60] butter you know like
[2882.96 - 2887.60] you know the oil that's mixed up and and
[2885.60 - 2891.52] floating at the top of a nut butter in a
[2887.60 - 2894.00] jar all that oil you see isn't added oil
[2891.52 - 2896.32] it's because the nuts were heated or
[2894.00 - 2897.68] roasted so i got some roasted nuts right
[2896.32 - 2899.68] here
[2897.68 - 2902.96] so i'm kind of curious
[2899.68 - 2905.92] is these roasted nuts gonna create like
[2902.96 - 2907.92] four ounces like two ounces
[2905.92 - 2910.32] right is it going to create like two
[2907.92 - 2912.00] ounces of
[2910.32 - 2914.40] of oil
[2912.00 - 2916.08] that float on the top and make it so
[2914.40 - 2918.72] it's like that so we're going to take a
[2916.08 - 2921.52] look we're going to do some
[2918.72 - 2921.52] that's really cool
[2923.28 - 2929.84] split screen was really cool all right
[2925.52 - 2929.84] let's go let's make them almond butter
[2931.68 - 2937.68] now when you buy an almond butter
[2935.04 - 2939.44] you have to know
[2937.68 - 2942.24] they add oil
[2939.44 - 2946.24] so if they say their almonds comes from
[2942.24 - 2948.80] the the finest family farms
[2946.24 - 2951.12] the finest family farms in india or the
[2948.80 - 2954.08] finest family farms forever
[2951.12 - 2955.52] in the u.s finally the finest family
[2954.08 - 2958.40] farms in
[2955.52 - 2960.96] in europe whatever they say the oil they
[2958.40 - 2963.44] add to it is from a different place it's
[2960.96 - 2967.04] not from those nuts so it's like you get
[2963.44 - 2969.20] this cheaper bulk grade oil that they

[3146.32 - 3148.72] and
[3147.44 - 3150.96] you're not

[3150.96 - 3155.92] just annihilated by all that rancid oil
[3154.56 - 3158.64] they put in
[3155.92 - 3161.60] just think about that
[3158.64 - 3161.60] i'd like to know where
[3163.44 - 3167.84] there you go
[3164.72 - 3167.84] get the rest of it in there
[3168.40 - 3170.64] okay
[3170.80 - 3174.32] all right so check this out you guys
[3174.40 - 3180.40] so what you're looking at right here
[3177.92 - 3184.00] okay you're looking at almond butter
[3180.40 - 3186.00] roasted almond butter okay there it is
[3184.00 - 3188.96] i'm gonna put it in the jar now
[3186.00 - 3192.00] but what's missing here that that's not
[3188.96 - 3193.76] missing on the store in the store when
[3192.00 - 3195.44] you go to the store so you walk into any
[3193.76 - 3196.72] of your health food stores and you buy a
[3195.44 - 3200.96] jar of
[3196.72 - 3203.28] peanut butter almond butter roast it raw
[3200.96 - 3205.28] you'll see oil in there whether it's
[3203.28 - 3206.84] mixed in there the reason why they do
[3205.28 - 3208.96] that is they give you
[3206.84 - 3210.88] less less
[3208.96 - 3213.28] less
[3210.88 - 3215.12] nuts and they give you more rancid oil
[3213.28 - 3217.20] so they add all this oil they give you
[3215.12 - 3218.64] less nuts and they add all this oil
[3217.20 - 3220.56] that's how it's done
[3218.64 - 3222.32] so i'm just letting you know
[3220.56 - 3224.24] that's how it's done so when you're
[3222.32 - 3226.72] making your own you don't have to go
[3224.24 - 3226.72] through that
[3227.20 - 3232.96] so let's let's put this in here
[3230.64 - 3235.04] now you can press it down in here is
[3232.96 - 3237.12] what you do okay you press it down in
[3235.04 - 3238.72] here

[3429.12 - 3433.68] the oil
[3430.32 - 3435.60] how come i can't drip all the oil out
[3433.68 - 3436.72] because there's because the system is
[3435.60 - 3438.48] rigged
[3436.72 - 3439.76] in the nut butter world
[3438.48 - 3440.72] it's rigged
[3439.76 - 3443.76] they
[3440.72 - 3445.68] cut corners they remove the nuts
[3443.76 - 3447.76] they give you some nuts
[3445.68 - 3449.28] and then they add all the oil that's
[3447.76 - 3451.04] bulk and cheap
[3449.28 - 3453.12] and they mix it
[3451.04 - 3455.36] and then you get the jar
[3453.12 - 3457.52] and it's half oil mixed in with whatever
[3455.36 - 3459.44] nut butter that is in there the oils
[3457.52 - 3460.40] from a different farm a different place
[3459.44 - 3462.88] on the planet
[3460.40 - 3465.04] and it's going rancid it's not even the
[3462.88 - 3466.88] same nut
[3465.04 - 3469.28] and that's what we do so it's like you
[3466.88 - 3471.52] buy the beautiful jar of olive oil i
[3469.28 - 3475.20] mean basically sorry you buy a beautiful
[3471.52 - 3477.44] jar of nut oil is what you're buying
[3475.20 - 3479.36] and not really getting nuts and the nut
[3477.44 - 3480.40] oils coming from different places around
[3479.36 - 3483.76] the world
[3480.40 - 3485.52] much of it's rancid it's old it's bulk
[3483.76 - 3487.76] and it's a cheap way they do it and you
[3485.52 - 3490.00] can have the finest organic
[3487.76 - 3492.32] nut butters out there but they're giving
[3490.00 - 3493.92] us so much oil
[3492.32 - 3495.52] and so yeah
[3493.92 - 3498.64] nicholas says omega has outdone
