1
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:07,279
an incredible Moment In Time

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,540
nearly a hundred thousand people

3
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,759
have signed up to the collecting Stone's

4
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:16,920
meditation Journey

5
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:20,160
there are tens of thousands of people

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:22,980
around the world right now

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:26,340
that are picking their stones in nature

8
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:28,859
or should I say their Stones could be

9
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:31,920
choosing them

10
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:35,340
what an incredible experience

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,380
when you're looking for your stones

12
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,180
which was yesterday

13
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,399
hopefully everybody found their stones

14
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:43,260
or their stones found them when you're

15
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:45,000
looking for this when you're looking for

16
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:47,520
these stones

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,879
keep in mind a connection is already

18
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:54,320
forming in that very moment

19
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:58,140
as you're even searching as your eyes

20
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:00,300
are looking on the ground

21
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,440
they're looking on that pathway you're

22
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,000
walking

23
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,280
they're looking

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,760
on the side of that Beach

25
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,439
your eyes are looking on that trail in

26
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,540
the woods

27
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:15,299
your eyes are looking in the parking lot

28
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:18,180
where you just parked your car

29
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:20,880
your eyes are looking in the yard

30
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:23,880
the backyard the front yard

31
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,860
and that intention is there

32
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:29,700
that intention

33
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:33,920
powerful meditative State intention

34
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,920
one of the most powerful of all

35
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:39,960
you're sending a signal

36
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,759
you're sending a frequency

37
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,560
to

38
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,659
these objects

39
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:48,119
that have been here for thousands upon

40
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:50,360
thousands upon thousands and millions of

41
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:50,360
years

42
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:55,680
how is it possible

43
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,000
that those stones have been here for so

44
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,520
long

45
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,100
and we haven't been here right now in

46
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:05,640
our physical bodies for so long

47
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:07,860
and that connection is made

48
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,500
is it possible those stones were waiting

49
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:12,720
millions of years

50
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,220
hundreds of thousands of years for that

51
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,520
connection to be made

52
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:20,700
for this very moment in time

53
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,500
it's more than possible

54
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:24,599
I think when you

55
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,220
walk along

56
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:27,780
and you're looking and searching for

57
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:30,300
your stones

58
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:32,340
like you already have

59
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:35,940
keep in mind

60
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:38,280
that that connection grows instantly

61
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:41,300
once you settle

62
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:45,180
on those three stones

63
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:47,220
immediately a connection develops

64
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:49,200
right there

65
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:51,660
and it builds from there and gets

66
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,920
stronger by the minute

67
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:54,920
Stronger by the seconds

68
00:02:55,019 --> 00:03:00,660
Stronger by the hours

69
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:04,800
already after you've chosen your stones

70
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:07,819
hours later a connection is developing

71
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,819
a frequency

72
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:13,019
is being

73
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:16,080
transferred back and forth

74
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:18,420
from you to the stones and from the

75
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,659
stones to you and from you to the stones

76
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:23,700
and the stones to you

77
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:27,080
we're day two of the collecting Stones

78
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:30,800
meditation journey I am

79
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:30,800
incredibly proud of everybody

80
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:37,440

you this

84
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:46,739
if it hasn't already happened starting

85
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:49,260
yesterday for you this is going to be

86
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:52,860
the most profound experience

87
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:55,140
in meditations you have ever had

88
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:58,379
and I can promise you this

89
00:03:55,140 --> 00:04:00,840
by the seventh day

90
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:05,340
your emotional state

91
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:08,459
your soul state will be changing forever

92
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:13,220
this is going to be the most profound

93
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:13,220
emotional experiences in your life

94
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,299
I know that's a lot to say

95
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:24,060
but as we get to the seventh day

96
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:25,800
you're truly going to feel it and You're

97
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:28,800
Gonna Know It

98
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:31,080
deep deep healing is going to happen in

99
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,220
inside of you

100
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,139
because

101
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:36,360
what we carry

102
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:39,060
is baggage

103
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,979
and we can't let it go and we don't know

104
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:44,100
how to let it go

105
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:45,840
we carry it with us

106
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:48,479
for days

107
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:51,419
for months for years

108
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:55,040
for a lifetime

109
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:55,040
Old Wounds old hurt

110
00:04:55,139 --> 00:05:00,240
the information from these wounds and

111
00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:02,360
hurts stored up in our cells

112
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,100
we've stuffed it down deep inside

113
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:06,960
whether it's purposely or not on purpose

114
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:09,720
it just happened

115
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:13,199
and it sits there and it percolates and

116
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:16,020
it festers and it hinders us

117
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,639
as we're moving through our life

118
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:20,759
and with the collecting Stones

119
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:24,060
meditation Journey what it does

120
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:26,580
is it starts to unpack it

121
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:29,280
but unpack it in a way that you don't

122
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:33,060
have to relive it

123
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:36,380
because the stones help you

124
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:38,699
and prevent you from having to relive

125
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:42,419
what that hurt was

126
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:45,539
a long time ago or even recently

127
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:47,520
the Stone's job is to actually absorb

128
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:50,100
and take in

129
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,020
those old experiences that became

130
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,479
baggage

131
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:56,039
it doesn't mean you're going to forget

132
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:58,160
everything from the past that wasn't

133
00:05:56,039 --> 00:06:01,680
good or not that's not what this is

134
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:05,780
Instead This opens up new space so new

135
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,780
experiences can find a home

136
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:11,160
so many people are struggling internally

137
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:12,960
without even realizing it because Old

138
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,000
Wounds are taking up so much space

139
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,340
inside of them

140
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,139
that it makes it hard to take in

141
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:21,060
something special

142
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:24,300
do you know anyone that that's happened

143
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:26,539
to where something good is happening but

144
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:29,759
it's hard to see it because you're numb

145
00:06:26,539 --> 00:06:32,520
or it's hard to feel it or experience it

146
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:34,740
because you're numb

147
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:37,080
do you know anyone who has gone through

148
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:39,419
that or experienced that

149
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:41,280
where something good is happening a

150
00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:43,259
moment's good but they can't really feel

151
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:47,840
it and they can't really see it

152
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:47,840
they feel numb or disconnected and lost

153
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,520
a lot of times for people that means

154
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:55,620
that there's so much baggage stored up

155
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:58,680
and hurt stored up that it's taking up

156
00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:00,660
so much space inside the soul

157
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:04,080
inside our being

158
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:06,900
that it's not allowing for room for new

159
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:09,660
references and new experiences to settle

160
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:13,919
in and make a home

161
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:16,380
and create an inner Joy over time

162
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:18,419
and sustain and inner Joy

163
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:20,280
instead when people have good things

164
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:22,259
happen to them they say they're grateful

165
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:25,020
but it may not feel like it sticks or

166
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:27,300
holds it fades away quick and dissipates

167
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:29,580
quick

168
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:33,180
and so with collecting Stone's Journey

169
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:36,720
what this meditation Journey does is it

170
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:40,259
clears the space it opens up

171
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:44,220
a channel inside your being

172
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:47,520
it moves out the garbage it transfers

173
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:50,280
that garbage that hurt those injuries

174
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:53,759
those old stifled emotions they're

175
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:57,919
stored down deep it transfer them out of

176
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,919
you and into the stones

177
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:05,460
what this does is it opens up

178
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:07,440
more you inside

179
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:09,599
because

180
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,520
you should never be defined by your hurt

181
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,740
and your experiences that were really

182
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,759
hardships difficult things that might

183
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,740
have happened whether it's with

184
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:18,360
relationships or

185
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:19,919
any kind of struggle throughout your

186
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,780
life

187
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:25,620
any kind of abuse or any kind of

188
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:28,259
difficult times whatever it may be

189
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:30,419
even having chronic illness and having

190
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:31,860
symptoms and conditions that have been

191
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:34,260
hard on you

192
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:37,260
throughout your life that played a role

193
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:39,419
in having hard situations because you

194
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:42,320
were struggling emotionally you were

195
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:42,320
struggling physically

196
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:48,120
and what happens is that when we have

197
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:50,160
all that built up inside of us and it's

198
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,360
stored inside of us it's hard to

199
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,880
actually

200
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,220
have something even if it resonates out

201
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:59,399
there something to really stick

202
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:01,500
it's hard for it to actually stick

203
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:04,200
meaning you can have a good experience

204
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:05,760
but you can then get numb to it and then

205
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,140
you feel like you're taking it for

206
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,240
granted but you're not taking it for

207
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:10,920
granted you just can't really feel it so

208
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,839
much you thought it was as good as you

209
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,519
thought it was but in the end you're

210
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:17,339
like I don't know anymore and you're

211
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:21,839
confused because there's no room there's

212
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:23,580
not enough room left inside of oneself

213
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:25,740
kind of like when someone goes through a

214
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:27,600
really difficult relationship and

215
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:29,640
they're not ready to get into another

216
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,220
relationship again because they just

217
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:34,680
don't have it in them they're just

218
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:37,080
burned out

219
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:40,260
what happens is all that hurt stays in

220
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:42,300
there and it percolates and it festers

221
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:44,760
and we need to get rid of that without

222
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:47,220
having to relive it or experience it

223
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:49,680
over and over again we need to get rid

224
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:52,800
of it we need it to leave us

225
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:56,519
so that the channel is clear

226
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:58,440
Clarity occurs and the channel is clear

227
00:09:56,519 --> 00:10:00,240
within us

228
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:02,519
we need to have the ability to start

229
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,620
fresh wherever we can even on the

230
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:09,140
smallest levels and the collecting Stone

231
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:09,140
meditation Journey allows for that

232
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:14,339
it opens up the door it opens up the

233
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,019
gate

234
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:18,480
so that when you experience something

235
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:22,140
good even on the smallest level even on

236
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:24,720
the smallest level just walking down a

237
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:26,399
trail and choosing your stones that

238
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,440
experience you'll never forget again

239
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:31,920
you'll never forget for the rest of your

240
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:34,140
life that's how powerful this is

241
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:37,080
this isn't just about collecting a few

242
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:39,779
stones and having some fun

243
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:41,580
this is way bigger than that and more

244
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:43,620
powerful than that the reason why I've

245
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:44,880
been saying all this time is that you're

246
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:46,200
never going to forget what's going to

247
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,540
happen and you're never going to forget

248
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:51,380
this journey is because that's true

249
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:51,380
you're not

250
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:54,440
because

251
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,880
what should shouldn't reside inside of

252
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:02,959
us any more

253
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,959
starts to leave

254
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,760
and so by the seventh day when we're

255
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:11,339
ready

256
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:14,779
and we take our stones

257
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:14,779
and we're gonna get our stones

258
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:19,560
to the place they need to be

259
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:23,399
it's going to be an incredible

260
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:25,560
experience and by the hour right now

261
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:28,560
there's going to be a bond between you

262
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:31,740
and your stones that gets stronger and

263
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:34,500
stronger and stronger because those

264
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:38,279
stones that are in your possession

265
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:39,779
are absorbing right now they're

266
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:42,779
absorbing

267
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:45,899
pain and suffering

268
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:49,140
they're absorbing old hurt from the past

269
00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:52,260
or even recently

270
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:54,839
they're absorbing experiences

271
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:56,760
that led to emotional pain

272
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:58,980
you still had the experience but they're

273
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:03,000
absorbing

274
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:06,600
a lot of the wounds that were left

275
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,940
from that experience and then

276
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,860
something opens up

277
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:14,300
and opens up

278
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:14,300
and it's like a fresh start

279
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:18,200
and we get clear

280
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:25,700
and we start to heal easier emotionally

281
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:25,700
mentally spiritually

282
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:35,660
and we get stronger and stronger

283
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:35,660
in every way possible

284
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:46,560
you're going to see as each day goes on

285
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:49,260
how powerful this really is

286
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:52,260
and how profound this really is

287
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:54,540
and the tens of thousands of people and

288
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:56,160
this isn't even counting the tens of

289
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,839
thousands that are also doing it that

290
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:01,820
aren't even signed up now they're doing

291
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,820
it because a family member is doing it

292
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:06,420
they're doing it because a friend is

293
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:09,180
doing it and they're not signed up but

294
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:13,260
they're doing it as well

295
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:15,540
estimated right now probably 250

296
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:17,100
000 individuals

297
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:19,500
are doing the collecting Stones

298
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:21,680
meditation Journey right now with all of

299
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,680
us

300
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:29,399
share your experience with the

301
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:32,100
collecting Stones meditation Journey

302
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:34,260
I would love to share those experiences

303
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:37,680
with the community

304
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:40,200
as your ex as you're experiencing it

305
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,240
as you go through all seven days through

306
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:45,660
these exercises

307
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:49,680
share your real or your posts in your

308
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:51,540
stories and tag medical medium and

309
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:54,540
hashtag medical medium at the same time

310
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:57,660
in your stories so that I can see it

311
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:59,220
because I can't see it if it's just a

312
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:02,459
post or real

313
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:05,639
because IG doesn't allow us to see it if

314
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:07,920
it's a poster real it has to be

315
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:11,660
tagged in your story

316
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,660
and hashtagged in your story too

317
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:18,980
if you signed up

318
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:24,899
Courtney says the download is everything

319
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:27,120
if you signed up there's a downloadable

320
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:29,820
PDF

321
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:33,779
do not miss out so there's downloadable

322
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:34,980
PDFs do not miss out on those make sure

323
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:37,380
you're signed up

324
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:39,360
so that you can get that information

325
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:41,279
Fly High on YouTube says I absolutely

326
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,040
love this journey I Feel So Close

327
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:48,860
emotionally with my Stones I feel their

328
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:48,860
energy it's so purifying and cleansing

329
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:55,980
prepare for a lot of tears to happen in

330
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,600
the seven day Journey

331
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:59,459
if they haven't happened yet they're

332
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,019
going to happen in the end and if they

333
00:14:59,459 --> 00:15:03,660
don't happen in the end you're still

334
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:05,760
going to feel it emotionally

335
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:07,740
and there's great reason for it

336
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:10,139
on IG

337
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:12,360

Alexandra Sofia says I had massive

347
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:44,160
emotional changes by evening of day one

348
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:46,800
it's mind-blowing explanation points wow

00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:50,100
I just kissed my rocks in profound

350
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:52,920
gratitude you did that too I have just

351
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:55,440
my rocks too so I have done that as well

352
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:58,459

00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,459
one that did that

354
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:05,459
just going to read a little bit from

355
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:07,199
this book right here which has the

356
00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:09,360
collecting stones

357
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:11,100
meditation journey in it so here it is

358
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,480
the medical medium book do you have a

359
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:15,300
copy of this

360
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:17,279
so keep in mind the PDF has additional

361
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:19,500
information it's not just what's in here

362
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:21,740
if you signed up there's additional

363
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,740
information

364
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:33,779
there's a question right here just

365
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:37,259
turning in have no idea how this was on

366
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:40,320
my phone playing live bless me

367
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:43,040
oh incredible I'm so glad that you're

368
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,040
here Tasha

369
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:48,959
hey Anthony can we choose more than

370
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:51,180
three stones if we have a lot of

371
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:54,620
emotional struggles we want to let go of

372
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:59,160
say like six stones or is three ideal

373
00:16:54,620 --> 00:17:02,040
great question three is ideal

374
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:05,220
three is important we have to have three

375
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:06,839
we have to focus on three at a time

376
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:10,579
because

377
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:13,079
if it's more than three our Focus

378
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:15,500
becomes scattered

379
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:19,199
our Focus

380
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:22,439
we lose detail we lose connection

381
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:24,000
three is the number chosen by Spirit of

382
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:25,439
compassion originally with the

383
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,439
collecting Stone's meditation Journey

384
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:30,480
going back forever now since I've

385
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:33,120
learned it from SOC

386
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:36,559
and although it may feel like you need

387
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:41,280
four because there's so many different

388
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:43,860
emotional names or tags or experiences

389
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:46,380
that you want to name

390
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:48,000
your stones or hardships or losses

391
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:49,380
there's so many different things that

392
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,660
you want to name your stones and that's

393
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:54,360
okay because these are the three stones

394
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:58,200
you choose for this

395
00:17:54,360 --> 00:18:00,419
meditation journey and then we do

396
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:02,580
another one all together

397
00:18:00,419 --> 00:18:06,780
we'll do another one I think we should

398
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:08,760
probably do a few of these

399
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:10,200
so we'll just prepare for a whole

400
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:12,059
another one because the reason why is

401
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:15,179
because there's going to be more names

402
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:17,940
you want in those on those stones

403
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:19,860
Erica Malik says are we able to rename

404
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:24,200
our Stones today

405
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:24,200
and start a day later yes you are

406
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,919
I'm just reading some comments you guys

407
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:34,380
I'm so glad we're here right now

408
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:36,000
um if you just got here listen to the

409
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:38,179
beginning of this video we're live right

410
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,179
now

411
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,580
foreign

412
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,799
medical medium collecting Stones

413
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:51,179
meditation Journey

414
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:53,640
a profound experience that

415
00:18:51,179 --> 00:18:56,760
is going to be life-changing when we

416
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:59,160
hear the term life-changing

417
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:01,559
and

418
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:03,600
we

419
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:05,880
use that a lot for a lot of different

420
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,380
things

421
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:09,780
keep in mind

422
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:11,820
when it comes to this

423
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:15,020
meditation it's unlike any other

424
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:15,020
meditation out there

425
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:21,260
it's unlike

426
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:21,260
any other spiritual exercise

427
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:25,260
you'll feel it instantly and you're

428
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,940
going to feel it for the through these

429
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:29,700
next seven days you should have already

430
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:32,460
received your day two video in your

431
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:34,679
email address it's coming from Hay House

432
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:36,900
not MediCal medium

433
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:40,320
keep in mind check your promotions and

434
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:43,200
spam and you can search Hay House in

435
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,760
your emails to find them

436
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,960
so that's important to know I think a

437
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,760
lot of people are looking for the

438
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:49,200
medical medium emails regarding the

439
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,940
collecting Stone's meditation Journey

440
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:55,919
but really we have to

441
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:57,660
be looking for the Hay House emails

442
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:59,820
for collecting Stone's meditation

443
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:01,740
Journey so that's important I think I'm

444
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:02,760
worried a few people will be like where

445
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:04,620
are they

446
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:06,960

464
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:51,419
challenging emotions

465
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:53,940
take a walk in nature and keep your eye

466
00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:56,340
out for small stones

467
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:59,100
that can call to you now that leads me

468
00:20:56,340 --> 00:21:00,960
to this part here

469
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,980
you can choose the size of the stone you

470
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,860
want

471
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:08,340
you can have them really small

472
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:10,679
you can have them a little bigger

473
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:13,080
you can have them bigger than this you

474
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:14,880
can have one big one one small one one

475
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:19,460
small one is whatever

476
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:19,460
calls to you it's whatever resonates

477
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:25,620
you can have tiny stones

478
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:28,380
really small ones

479
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:30,659
size of beans if you want

480
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:33,179
Pebbles

481
00:21:30,659 --> 00:21:34,620
and then you can have them bigger they

482
00:21:33,179 --> 00:21:37,640
could be

483
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:37,640
much bigger

484
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:41,400
and lately I've been seeing on social

485
00:21:39,659 --> 00:21:43,860
some people have some pretty big Stones

486
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:46,140
I'm like well that's a really big one

487
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:48,299
educating myself says can disease be

488
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:52,080
released this way

489
00:21:48,299 --> 00:21:54,299
the emotional wounds from illnesses can

490
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:56,280
because that's a big

491
00:21:54,299 --> 00:21:58,260
big thing right there because what

492
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:00,720
happens is we get beaten down when we're

493
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:04,140
sick with chronic illness

494
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:06,780
we get beaten down long term if we've

495
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:08,520
been through a lot and have gone a long

496
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:10,860
distance with our chronic sickness and

497
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:12,539
symptoms and conditions

498
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:15,059
and there's so much hurt that gets

499
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:18,179
stored up just think about and you would

500
00:22:15,059 --> 00:22:20,400
know many of you who have OCD

501
00:22:18,179 --> 00:22:22,799
think about how much hurt occurs with

502
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,900
family members when you have OCD with

503
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:27,360
friends in relationships

504
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:28,620
same thing with anxiety think about how

505
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:31,260
much hurt has occurred in your life

506
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:34,620
because you've had so many panic attacks

507
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:37,440
and how that hurt has transpired into a

508
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:40,380
lot of emotional hurt through lit

509
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,760
relationships and friends and family and

510
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:43,500
and just

511
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:46,200
through life

512
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:49,620
so anyone with a symptom or condition

513
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:51,900
comes with also hurt

514
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:54,480
especially if it's been months and

515
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:55,980
months and it's taken a long time to

516
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,440
heal because you've been searching and

517
00:22:55,980 --> 00:23:00,480
searching and going to so many different

518
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:03,480
practitioners and doctors and looking

519
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:05,520
for answers and haven't found them the

520
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:09,679
hurt that goes along the way is very

521
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,679
difficult just think about when someone

522
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:14,400
they look fine from the outside but

523
00:23:12,539 --> 00:23:15,960
they're not fine on the inside and how

524
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,460
people including practitioners or

525
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:19,799
doctors will say to them well you look

526
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:21,299
good or friends and family will be like

527
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:24,299
you look good

528
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:26,820
I know we can't see the

529
00:23:24,299 --> 00:23:29,400
Tremor you have internally and that

530
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:32,340
sickness you feel and the fatigue you

531
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:34,500
feel and how heavy your arms are and how

532
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:37,740
you just don't have the energy to walk

533
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:39,539
good we can't really see that but right

534
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:41,520
now you look really good and so many

535
00:23:39,539 --> 00:23:45,059
people

536
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:48,679
I think just we just lost um one thing

537
00:23:45,059 --> 00:23:48,679
there so many people

538
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:56,400
suffer emotionally they suffer mentally

539
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:57,299
from so much hurt from being chronically

540
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,980
ill

541
00:23:57,299 --> 00:24:00,900
and then when we have all that baggage

542
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:02,640
stored up in us and everything stored up

543
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:04,380
so deeply

544
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,539
and it's kind of bogging us down

545
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:08,700
mentally and emotionally it doesn't help

546
00:24:06,539 --> 00:24:10,860
when we're trying to heal

547
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:14,700
so the collecting Stone's meditation

548
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:16,799
journey is about clearing out that space

549
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:18,720
and I know so many people who have

550
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:20,460
struggled because they were sick so long

551
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,740
and they were hurt emotionally because

552
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:24,539
of it they were misunderstood

553
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:27,240
that's a huge one right there so many

554
00:24:24,539 --> 00:24:30,419
people who have been chronically ill

555
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:32,700
have been misunderstood

556
00:24:30,419 --> 00:24:34,140
and that misunderstanding that occurs

557
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:37,740
when you're sick and you're searching

558
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:40,260
for help can feel very painful and it

559
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:41,880
becomes a wound and a pattern that gets

560
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:43,679
internalized

561
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:45,480
and collecting Stone's meditation

562
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:48,299
journey is about taking that and

563
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:51,500
removing that and clearing that out

564
00:24:48,299 --> 00:24:51,500
getting a fresh start

565
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:59,340
take a walk in nature and keep your eye

566
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:01,320
out for small stones that call to you

567
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:03,659
because there is a connection happening

568
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:06,000
the minute you make that intention that

569
00:25:03,659 --> 00:25:07,500
intention is clear I'm going to do this

570
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,740
meditation Journey

571
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:13,559
I'm going to collect my stones

572
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:17,039
the minute that frequency is sent out

573
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:20,240
right there it's sent out

574
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:20,240
there are stones

575
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:28,020
that are there to receive it

576
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:31,260
so you're three stones

577
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:33,840
are sitting somewhere in the sand in the

578
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:34,860
dirt on the trail on the grass on the

579
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,779
ground

580
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:37,980
on the side of a parking lot wherever

581
00:25:36,779 --> 00:25:40,140
they are

582
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:42,419
your three stones

583
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:45,179
are out there

584
00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:47,520
and they're picking up on your

585
00:25:45,179 --> 00:25:51,140
intentions that I am searching for you

586
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,140
I'm looking for you because

587
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,400
because I need help

588
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:02,940
and IG what does it mean when a stone

589
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:06,120
falls down to the floor

590
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:10,740
so you drop the stone

591
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:13,200
one thing is what was that Stone named

592
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:15,659
so that's important to know right there

593
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:17,520
did you already name your stones at that

594
00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:19,260
point before you dropped a stone on the

595
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:22,140
floor I dropped the stone on the floor

596
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:24,720
before starting this live

597
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:27,600
it went boink on the ground and on the

598
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:29,039
floor and it rolled way over there

599
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,020
it has meaning

600
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:33,240
it does

601
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:35,940
and so whatever you named your stones

602
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:39,000
and the stone that dropped is the stone

603
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:41,120
trying to run away from you

604
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,919
is the

605
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:47,159
emotion or the wound

606
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:49,260
that is getting absorbed in that stone

607
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:51,919
is it trying to get away from you so you

608
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,919
can't rid it

609
00:26:55,380 --> 00:27:01,440
is it about loyalty to all three stones

610
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:03,539
is it a test

611
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,039
so that you leave out a third Stone you

612
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:06,539
leave out one of those stones because it

613
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:09,659
fell and it went somewhere and they're

614
00:27:06,539 --> 00:27:11,279
just holding now two of them

615
00:27:09,659 --> 00:27:14,179
you can ask yourself a lot of questions

616
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:14,179
involving that

617
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:21,960
Maggie over there at IG says I slept

618
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:26,120
with my Stones next to me on my bed they

619
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:26,120
were on my bed with me laugh out loud

620
00:27:27,539 --> 00:27:31,740
my stones are very dear to me right now

621
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,940
in this collecting Stone's meditation

622
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:36,200
Journey

623
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:36,200
and I do the same thing

624
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,360
Anthony

625
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:45,419
over there in IG hey Anthony can I name

626
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:46,620
the stones after my ill organs yes you

627
00:27:45,419 --> 00:27:49,140
can

628
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:51,419
because a lot of times when we know we

629
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:52,810
have an ill organ because we've been

630
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:54,720
diagnosed with an ill organ

631
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:57,720
[Music]

632
00:27:54,720 --> 00:28:00,000
an emotional storm hits us

633
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:02,640
like how can that happen with my liver

634
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,799
how can that happen with my spleen how

635
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:07,620
is this happening with my thyroid how is

636
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:10,260
this happening with my heart how's this

637
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:14,220
happening with my kidney and then we we

638
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:16,679
get we get PTSD from it we battle and we

639
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:18,659
struggle on our sickness and our

640
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:21,360
struggle with our sickness and we battle

641
00:28:18,659 --> 00:28:23,580
with it and it takes up space and it

642
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:25,620
takes up space

643
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:28,020
and so the collecting Stones meditation

644
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:30,740
journey is about the stones absorbing

645
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:30,740
that pain

646
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:36,240
and those wounds

647
00:28:33,539 --> 00:28:38,419
and that information and clearing the

648
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,419
way

649
00:28:39,179 --> 00:28:45,679
for when the time comes and we need to

650
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:45,679
let go and we need to release

651
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:57,779
Victoria says I am here where I grew up

652
00:28:56,220 --> 00:29:00,840
in the Midwest

653
00:28:57,779 --> 00:29:02,100
thousand miles from my home of 45 years

654
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:04,620
out east

655
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:08,039
today I felt guided to get three new

656
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:12,240
rocks at this site of our house

657
00:29:08,039 --> 00:29:14,760
at our house fire in 1967

658
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:17,940
I began to cry the moment I stepped out

659
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:22,140
of the car onto the Gravel Road

660
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:25,320
I knew it was deep healing more to share

661
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:28,620
this is good for now yes I found Stones

662
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:30,240

in this exercise

677
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:10,140

678
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:11,580
that connection is there whether we have

679

it that connection is there

682
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:22,039

it's not breakable

686
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:32,399
powerful stones are made out of minerals

687
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:34,940
they're all minerals everything is

688
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:34,940
minerals

689
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:39,720
every

690
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:41,279
single piece of vegetation every tree

691
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:43,620
every Rock

692
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:46,380
all the water on this planet every

693
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:47,580
single living species is made out of

694
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:49,380
minerals

695
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:52,880
it's all minerals and minerals

696
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:52,880
communicate with minerals

697
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:59,700
Marie I named my Stones low confidence

698
00:30:56,179 --> 00:31:01,380
loss of purpose and depression

699
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:03,480
powerful

700
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:06,320
that's powerful

701
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:06,320
truly

702
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:11,299
really is

703
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:20,700
singing sweetly says not this meditation

704
00:31:18,179 --> 00:31:22,020
but after the light blasts I stopped

705
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:23,960
overeating

706
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:26,700
it's incredible I'm hearing every day

707
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:28,919
profound profound changes in people's

708
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:31,620
lives after the light blast

709
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:34,320
and it and it keeps on going it keeps on

710
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:37,980
going for people even months later

711
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:40,399
and things surface it's it's incredible

712
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:40,399
okay

713
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:45,840
name each Stone by the label of whatever

714
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:48,539
you're harboring that you'd like to

715
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:52,380
leave you that you would like to leave

716
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:54,480
you very important to name each Stone by

717
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:58,500
the label of whatever you're harboring

718
00:31:54,480 --> 00:32:00,779
that you would like to leave you

719
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:04,980
for example you might name the Stone's

720
00:32:00,779 --> 00:32:07,679
guilt fear and anger or hate or shame or

721
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:10,039
disappointment or frustration sorrow or

722
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:10,039
despair

723
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:15,240
naming the stones is an experience all

724
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:18,539
in its own

725
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:22,080
that right there how many of you

726
00:32:18,539 --> 00:32:24,659
found that to be

727
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:27,480
an amazing or intense experience

728
00:32:24,659 --> 00:32:28,380

intuitive yoga says over there at IG I

756
00:33:48,659 --> 00:33:54,179
was surprised by what came up I was also

757
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:55,799
surprised when I named my biggest Stone

758
00:33:54,179 --> 00:34:00,500
grief

759
00:33:55,799 --> 00:34:00,500
as that is the biggest emotion I carry

760
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:09,359
oh

761
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:11,940
if I get quiet sometimes it's just I get

762
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:15,000
emotional too because knowing that

763
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:17,280
you're carrying that much grief knowing

764
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,740
that that's residing inside of you and

765
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:22,080
you're struggling with it and it could

766
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:23,220
be for a long time it's heartbreaking

767
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:25,080
and

768
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:26,639
that's the thing about Spirit of

769
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:28,020
compassion

770
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:31,919
creating

771
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:34,320
a meditative a meta a meditation to this

772
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:36,599
extent which helps so much I'm so

773
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:38,820
excited about you being here

774
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:40,980
Sue over there in IG says yes naming

775
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:43,859
them was incredible because it validated

776
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:45,359
the feelings and pain

777
00:34:43,859 --> 00:34:47,099
that's

778
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:48,780
that's amazing because so many people

779
00:34:47,099 --> 00:34:51,179
are going to have a

780
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:53,520
similar or different experience or some

781
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:55,740
type of similarity with experience when

782
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:59,780
they name their stones

783
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:59,780
when you name your stone

784
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:04,500
something happens

785
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:08,820
with their soul

786
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:10,440
it instantly throws out like a pathway

787
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:14,000
to the stone

788
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:14,000
so when you name your stone

789
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:22,260
instantly a pathway

790
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:25,079
gets delivered right to the stone

791
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:27,240
like a connection

792
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:30,079
a wire

793
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:30,079
a thread

794
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:38,640
Barbara says over there on Facebook I

795
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:41,280
named one of my Stones unloved

796
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:44,280
but it's a mixture of emotions like I

797
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:46,079
was unseen unheard unvalidated

798
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:48,240
unimportant

799
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:49,920
so I just summed it up with feeling

800
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:52,920
unloved

801
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:56,460
but now I think I should just pick one

802
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:58,380
like unseen for example and leave the

803
00:35:56,460 --> 00:36:01,619
other specific feelings for the next

804
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:05,040
round of seven days question mark yes

805
00:36:01,619 --> 00:36:06,420
the answer yes Save the others from the

806
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,280
next round of seven days because this

807
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:10,440
isn't going to be the only one we're

808
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:13,380
doing because so much of Us carry so

809
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:15,900
much and have been through so much

810
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:17,280
and the three names you're choosing this

811
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:19,079
time will be different than the three

812
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:23,300
names you choose next time unless you

813
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:23,300
choose to choose the same names again

814
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:28,920
which you're of course welcome to do

815
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:31,260
but chances are you'll be choosing some

816
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:33,839
different names

817
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:35,700
as well

818
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:38,940
carry these stones with you wherever you

819
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:41,720
go keep them in your pocket so keep them

820
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:41,720
in your pocket

821
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:49,520
if you can you don't have pockets try to

822
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:49,520
keep them with you wherever you go

823
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:58,200
do not

824
00:36:52,740 --> 00:37:00,300
get worried or scared if you lose one

825
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:02,520
if you lose one

826
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:05,240
before the seven days

827
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:05,240
that's okay

828
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:16,560
Ambrose says on IG habits Financial

829
00:37:13,619 --> 00:37:20,300
worry judgmental or mine

830
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:20,300
powerful really powerful

831
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:25,079
keep them in your pocket if you'd like

832
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:27,960
or even in your hands

833
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:30,720
get to know each of your three stones so

834
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:35,180
get to know your three stones

835
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:35,180
and get to know the sound of them too

836
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:53,119
yours are going to sound different

837
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:56,220
everybody's stones are going to sound

838
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:58,920
different they're going to have their

839
00:37:56,220 --> 00:38:00,540
own unique frequency and only unique

840
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:04,440
sound when they get

841
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:06,960
join together everybody stones are going

842
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:10,380
to sound different

843
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:14,099
there's not one stone that's going to

844
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:17,280
sound the same as somebody else's Stone

845
00:38:14,099 --> 00:38:20,119
especially as the stones are absorbing

846
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,119
that grief

847
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:26,400
the feeling of being unloved

848
00:38:22,619 --> 00:38:28,140
that feeling of fear shame guilt

849
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:32,280
Trust

850
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:32,280
all of it as

851
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:39,180
it your stones are absorbing all of that

852
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:40,560
coming from you the sounds will even

853
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:42,359
change

854
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:45,480
but no stones are going to sound the

855
00:38:42,359 --> 00:38:49,380
same and no stones are going to be

856
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:51,480
the same sound if you just got on here

857
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:54,540
this is open to the public right here of

858
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:56,280
course this is alive we're doing

859
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:59,160
so you might come on here and be like

860
00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:01,320
whoa let me check out a w

861
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:03,060

and we're on day two of the collecting

865
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:10,560
Stones meditation Journey link is in

866
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:13,339
description link is in the profile just

867
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,339
so everybody knows

868
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:20,760
Julie Tuesday over there on YouTube says

869
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:23,300
I named my Stones trauma loss and pet

870
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:23,300
deaths

871
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,060
I understand

872
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:33,480
get to know each of your three stones

873
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:35,220
look at them when you get an opportunity

874
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:37,200
and I realize we have to live our life

875
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:38,880
and you can't just stare at them all day

876
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:41,960
long you can't just stare at your Stones

877
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,960
every single minute

878
00:39:44,579 --> 00:39:49,579
keep that in mind

879
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:49,579
that's reasonable

880
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:56,460
but

881
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:58,079
look at your Stones when you can

882
00:39:56,460 --> 00:40:00,119
if you're eating or if you're doing

883
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:03,619
something whatever it is

884
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:03,619
look at your Stones when you can

885
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,960
carry them with you so you know they're

886
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:08,700
there so if you don't look at them and

887
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,800
you don't see them carry them with you

888
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:14,300
so that you know they're there

889
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,300
knowing they're there is really good

890
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:18,060
because it's powerful because it's

891
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:20,280
actually

892
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:22,200
a messaging that occurs it's a

893
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:24,780
connection that stays there it stays

894
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:26,520
there anyway but

895
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:28,200
it only gets stronger when you're like

896
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:30,480
oh yeah that's right my stones are here

897
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:32,820
with me my stones are in my pocket my

898
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:35,180
stones are in my purse my stones are in

899
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:35,180
my bag

900
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:40,980
look at them when you can and when you

901
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:43,619
can get an opportunity study the

902
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:45,180
surfaces of your Stones you want to know

903
00:40:43,619 --> 00:40:49,099
what book I'm in right here collecting

904
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:49,099
Stones meditation is in this book

905
00:40:52,619 --> 00:40:58,740
study the surfaces they're Terrain

906
00:40:55,980 --> 00:41:02,480
and so I'm sure you guys are doing that

907
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:02,480
already getting to know your stones

908
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:06,480
so that's something you might want to do

909
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:09,420
have you washed and cleaned your Stones

910
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:14,220
let's go into that a little bit

911
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:17,900
I noticed that I saw on social a lot of

912
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:17,900
people rinsing off their stones

913
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:21,300
it's a profound experience all on its

914
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:25,700
own

915
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:25,700
when I washed my stones

916
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:31,220
and moved them around my hand like I

917
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:31,220
showed you in yesterday's video

918
00:41:32,099 --> 00:41:38,300
a feeling was just coming over me like

919
00:41:35,099 --> 00:41:38,300
coursing through my veins

920
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:46,740
and washing them is this like baptizing

921
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:51,240
moment it's this cleansing moment

922
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:51,240
it's this anointment moment

923
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:58,140
it's a moment of caring it's a moment of

924
00:41:55,800 --> 00:42:01,820
connection occurring so when you're

925
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:01,820
washing your three stones

926
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:08,339
and you said she hasn't cried today

927
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:10,440
which is unusual

928
00:42:08,339 --> 00:42:13,160
that's interesting

929
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:13,160
definitely

930
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:22,859
so I think when

931
00:42:18,359 --> 00:42:25,500
that part when we unearth our stones

932
00:42:22,859 --> 00:42:28,160
and there's still some sand and a little

933
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:28,160
bit of dirt

934
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:36,060
and some organic matter attached to it

935
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:38,760
and we wash and clean our Stones there's

936
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:41,220
like I'm taking care of you

937
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:43,680
I'm looking out for you I want to see

938
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:46,020
what you look like I want to clean you

939
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:48,000
up it's a profound experience all on its

940
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:49,680
own

941
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,480
Chelsea Williams says I was very

942
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:53,579
emotional naming my stones and

943
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:57,180
surprisingly was guided to name them

944
00:42:53,579 --> 00:43:00,859
differently than what I thought I would

945
00:42:57,180 --> 00:43:00,859
that's interesting too

946
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:07,319

original and beautiful thank you aw and

948
00:43:07,319 --> 00:43:11,880
SOC

949
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:14,760
well

950
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:18,240
it's socs

951
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:21,560
I'm here as a messenger to make sure

952
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:21,560
I can help you guys

953
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:28,260
heart scent said I found my stones on IG

954
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:30,180
you found them

955
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:32,099
yes it's very possible that you'll name

956
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:34,260
your stone something different than you

957
00:43:32,099 --> 00:43:35,880
weren't expecting that you weren't

958
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:38,300
thinking you would name them and that

959
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:38,300
can happen

960
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:43,579
that can happen

961
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:46,319
getting familiar with your Stones

962
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:48,839
cleaning your stones

963
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:50,880
washing your Stones a huge part of

964
00:43:48,839 --> 00:43:53,160
making that connection occur

965
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:57,359
keep in mind

966
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:59,760
that your stones are there to absorb

967
00:43:57,359 --> 00:44:01,680
and when you're cleaning them up and

968
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:03,540
you're

969
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:06,540
washing them

970
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:08,400
you're getting rid of debris

971
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:10,980
so that you and your Stones can have

972
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:12,960
even a closer connection

973
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:15,300
and there isn't

974
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:18,000
all the sand and dirt that also has

975
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:19,500
minerals blanketing over the stones

976
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,599
that's why it's important to actually

977
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:23,960
give them a rinse give them a wash and a

978
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:23,960
cleaning

979
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:34,160
Tamara says my Stones I think are in my

980
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:34,160
fanny pouch on me like a kangaroo

981
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:43,680
and IG is inig says I put the opposite

982
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:45,680
feeling for example

983
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:49,980
to

984
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:52,680
confusion I name it clarity

985
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:54,660
okay well if that speaks to you and

986
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:57,480
that's what you feel like doing

987
00:44:54,660 --> 00:45:01,339
of course you can name your Stones what

988
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:01,339
you would like to name your stones

989
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:06,240
you can

990
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:08,520
but you don't want to absorb your

991
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:11,040
clarity

992
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:13,680
into the stones

993
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:17,000
you want to keep your clarity

994
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:20,640
but you do want to absorb

995
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:23,400
confusion into the stone

996
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:25,680
because remember this

997
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:27,900
you want

998
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:30,119
what's going on

999
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:34,200
your struggle to be something that

1000
00:45:30,119 --> 00:45:35,940
leaves opens a channel escapes so that

1001
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:38,280
space is opened up but of course you can

1002
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:41,940
name your Stones anything you can name

1003
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:43,980
your Stones anything you'd like

1004
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:45,599
and that's okay because your stones are

1005
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:48,619
working for you

1006
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:48,619
and that's okay

1007
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:52,560
so if you name your stone something like

1008
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:53,880
even happiness it doesn't mean your

1009
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:56,160
stones are going to absorb and take

1010
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:57,480
happiness away

1011
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:59,880
but it

1012
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:01,560
but your stones will be able to work

1013
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:03,780
with you on that

1014
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:06,599
that means your stones will be like well

1015
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:08,940
what that person needs is even more

1016
00:46:06,599 --> 00:46:11,040
happiness

1017
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:13,079
Agostino says if someone has a difficult

1018
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:15,540
time connecting with the stones will it

1019
00:46:13,079 --> 00:46:18,359
still work yes

1020
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:20,339
keep doing the daily exercises if you

1021
00:46:18,359 --> 00:46:24,319
don't do the daily exercises and you

1022
00:46:20,339 --> 00:46:24,319
don't want to participate

1023
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:31,200
and that doesn't help Julie Tuesday 144

1024
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:33,480
I had trouble naming my Stones I kept

1025
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:35,780
changing their names then I finally

1026
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:38,640
talked to them and after a few

1027
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:42,119
interventions the names were there

1028
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:44,720
trauma loss and pet deaths

1029
00:46:42,119 --> 00:46:44,720
I understand

1030
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:51,260
this

1031
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:51,260
is the second day

1032
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:57,180
I am

1033
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:59,819
thoroughly excited about each day after

1034
00:46:57,180 --> 00:47:01,680
today today and tomorrow and the next

1035
00:46:59,819 --> 00:47:03,599
day all the way to the seven day

1036
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:06,599
on the seventh day

1037
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:09,480
is going to be unlike anything

1038
00:47:06,599 --> 00:47:13,400
anybody has ever experienced

1039
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:13,400
I know that's a tall order

1040
00:47:14,579 --> 00:47:20,400
but this is

1041
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:22,920
not the normal meditation out there

1042
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:24,780
it's not the normal meditation we do we

1043
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:26,880
sit down and we try to like clear our

1044
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:29,400
thoughts when we go into nature and we

1045
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:32,819
sit in nature this

1046
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:35,700
is profound in its own way

1047
00:47:32,819 --> 00:47:39,060
powerful in its own way

1048
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:40,980
and so I'm preparing you guys

1049
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:44,400
because if you haven't already felt

1050
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:45,180
something occurring you're going to feel

1051
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:48,119
it

1052
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:50,640
soon if you haven't already

1053
00:47:48,119 --> 00:47:52,800
just choosing the stones

1054
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:53,940
is like a religious experience all on

1055
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,440
its own

1056
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:57,359
it's like the spiritual experience all

1057
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:58,740
on its own

1058
00:47:57,359 --> 00:47:59,940
and you guys already know because you've

1059
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:02,880
already done it

1060
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:05,520
Iona says my stones are very comforting

1061
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:08,300
they helped me through food cravings and

1062
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:08,300
mood swings

1063
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:12,660
amazing

1064
00:48:11,099 --> 00:48:15,359
truly

1065
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:16,980
so I just wanted to tell you guys that I

1066
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:19,380

doing this with you we're doing it all

1068
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:22,800
together

1069
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:24,960
very excited

1070
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:28,280
very very excited about

1071
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:28,280

00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:34,200
and I'm looking forward to each minute

1073
00:48:31,859 --> 00:48:35,460
and each hour and each day with you

1074
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:37,260
share your experience with the

1075
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:38,579
collecting Stones meditation journey I

1076
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:41,339
would love to share with the community

1077
00:48:38,579 --> 00:48:42,780
your experience as you go through the

1078
00:48:41,339 --> 00:48:45,420
seven days

1079
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:47,220
and all through the exercises I want to

1080
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:49,440
share those experiences with the

1081
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:52,560
exercises and what you're doing but

1082
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:55,440
remember share your real or post in your

1083
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:58,140
stories you have to share your real or

1084
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:59,520
your post in your stories and tag at

1085
00:48:58,140 --> 00:49:03,420
Medical medium and hashtag medical

1086
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:05,819
medium or I can't see it if you don't so

1087
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:09,200
share your real and your story

1088
00:49:05,819 --> 00:49:09,200
in there that's what I would do

1089
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:14,300
if you can if you can

1090
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:21,260
um I think that

1091
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:23,940
even Dr Nesbitt

1092
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:27,800
is participating in the Three Stones

1093
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:27,800
just so everybody knows

1094
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:32,960
so

1095
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:32,960
Dr Nesbitt

1096
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:37,920
Dr Nesbit always seems to

1097
00:49:36,119 --> 00:49:39,960
those are mine

1098
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:44,660
yeah where is yours

1099
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:44,660
Dr yes bit scrabbing his stones

1100
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:49,760
he's got this Stone here what is that

1101
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:49,760
stone

1102
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:56,460
well I don't know if you

1103
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:58,560
let me grab this Stone here

1104
00:49:56,460 --> 00:50:03,079
Dr Nesbit Stone

1105
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:03,079
if if you don't know Dr Nesbitt

1106
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:07,560
um Dr Nesbitt is a board-certified

1107
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:09,480
psychiatrist and a board-certified

1108
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:10,920
surgeon but if you don't know who Dr

1109
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:13,319
Nesbitt is

1110
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:15,380
you might not have been keeping up then

1111
00:50:13,319 --> 00:50:17,819
in the last three years Dr Nesbit

1112
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:20,700
surfaced I think about three years ago

1113
00:50:17,819 --> 00:50:23,220
he decided he wanted to be

1114
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:25,440
public

1115
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:28,140
you forgot this one here

1116
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:30,319
so Dr Nesbitt has his three zones right

1117
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:30,319
here

1118
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:38,220
Dr Nesbit struggling with a few things

1119
00:50:35,819 --> 00:50:40,800
so let's just find out

1120
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:45,859
I just didn't want to tell everybody

1121
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:45,859
Dr Nesbitt named one stone alcohol

1122
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:50,400
so Dr Nesbitt says he drinks a lot of

1123
00:50:48,119 --> 00:50:53,160
alcohol after surgery every single day

1124
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:55,680
that's the that's alcohol Dr Nesbitt

1125
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:56,760
said that's the alcohol Stone right

1126
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:58,920
there

1127
00:50:56,760 --> 00:51:00,599
okay Dr Elizabeth what's that stone

1128
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:04,940
right there

1129
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:04,940
so Dr Nesbitt what did you name this one

1130
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:09,660
Dr Nesbitt is naming this one cigars I

1131
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:12,480
don't know if that's a good idea Dr

1132
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:14,460
