to read a quote to you guys

123
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,920
before we get started talking about

124
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:59,439

125
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:01,920
um readers continue

126
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:03,280
to introduce more and more healthcare

127
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,319
providers to this

128
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,400
book and it has prompted

129
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:10,560
a new movement to look for the deeper

130
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,840
causes of chronic illness and to take

131
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:16,239
epstein-barr

132
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,680
virus seriously prior to the publication

133
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:21,680
of medical medium

134
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:24,280
the first edition right ebv

135
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,840
epstein-barr virus was practically a

136
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,520
non-concern

137
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,120
medical communities didn't understand

138
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,080
what the virus could do

139
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,680
because for example medical research and

140
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,240
science were unaware

141
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,400
that epstein-barr virus creates symptoms

142
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,880
that led to neurological problems you

143
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,840
guys

144
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,400
neurological problems caused by

145
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,560
epstein-barr

146
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:47,280
medical medium was ahead of the curve

147
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,840
there not one single doctor

148
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,880
on planet earth nor did medical research

149
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,120
and science know

150
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,240
that epstein-barr led to a neurological

151
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,800
symptom

152
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,000
and medical medium book one brought that

153
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,520
truth out

154
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,639
um very special okay

155
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,240
now epstein-barr virus testing and

156
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:09,520
awareness are becoming

157
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,160
every day at the doctor's office because

158
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,680
of little

159
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:15,600
me well spirit of compassion really i

160
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,440
can't take credit

161
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,759
research and science are finally

162
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:22,240
starting to find a link

163
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,039
between epstein-barr virus and dozens of

164
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,320
conditions

165
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:28,800
after the publication years after

166
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,400
research and science are finding a link

167
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,280
so when someone says where's your

168
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:35,039
science where's your science

169
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,960
where's your science medical medium

170
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:38,720
where's your study well how about this

171
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,120
medical research and science is taking

172
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,880
all my information and using it

173
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,560
they take it after medical medium

174
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,080
publishes a book and then medical

175
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,479
research and science a couple years

176
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,120
later

177
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:50,160
takes it and plagiarizes the information

178
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,080
so stop saying

179
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,000
where's your science because really

180
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,000
where's their science well it's here

181
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,319
they're taking it from here and using it

182
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,160
anyway it's just fun

183
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,000
and that's the truth medical medium new

184
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,080

196
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:31,600

242
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,840
the one out of a hundred thousand people

243
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,599
or whatever it is

244
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,759
it's like that and there's people i eat

245
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,479
a piece of cheese and i get a swelling

246
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,280
in my mouth

247
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:23,199
i eat an egg and then my face blows up i

00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,879
eat you know i hear this all the time

249
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:27,599
it's every single food

250
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:29,039
on the planet someone's gonna have

251
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,800
something to it right

252
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:32,560
but when they have a little problem with

253
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,200
the tomato it's because of tomatoes a

254
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:37,519
nightshade and it's a really bad tomato

255
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,519
you know tomatoes are really bad but

256
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,360
they're not bad and that swelling may

257
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,800
stop someday and you may not have a

258
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,839
reaction but you but i'm going to give

259
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,440
i'm going to help you to be your own

260
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:48,720
private detective right

261
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:52,160
is it to is it a tomato by itself

262
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:55,680
is it a fresh ripe organic tomato

263
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:57,360
by itself right that does it

264
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,120
that's one question right there and if

265
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,240
you're getting a swelling don't eat them

266
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,560
don't eat them

267
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,279
um so that's one thing to know or is it

268
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,560
tomato

269
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:07,279
sauce mixed with canola oil is it some

270
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,000
tomato

271
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:10,560
treat that's got natural flavoring in it

272
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,160
is it

273
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:16,320
is it tomato with cheese is it tomato

274
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,320
cheese some kind of parmesan is it

275
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:21,440
lasagna and it's the tomato

276
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:23,360
like whatever it is is it ketchup

277
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,480
and you're having this problem or don't

278
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,600
or you don't have the problem with

279
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,279
ketchup so

280
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,880
all these things are just questions to

281
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:30,240
kind of look at right there so that's

282
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,240
number one

283
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,680
do you swell with any other food that's

284
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,040
another question ask yourself to be your

285
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,160
own detective and i tell this for

286
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,760
everybody

287
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,680
like anybody who swells want to eat a

288
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,959
carrot because i i've run into that all

289
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,959
the time people like i can't touch

290
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:46,160
carrots i can't touch carrot juice

291
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:49,040
my mouth swells up it is it is it

292
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,800
you know that's so is it any other food

293
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,360
no other food swells up your mouth on

294
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,440
any level

295
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,120
not one other food you can eat anything

296
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,920
doesn't matter pork fish

297
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,640
chicken you know eggs whatever you can

298
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,360
glam

299
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,680
uh you know milk cheese butter not just

300
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,760
that

301
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,760
any vegetable anything there is right

302
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,200
any fruit the only thing that makes you

303
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,640
swell is tomatoes that's the next thing

304
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,000
you kind of kind of kind of

305
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,160
kind of got to look at and be your own

306
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,920
detective i say this for everyone who

307
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,360
swells to something i see people who

308
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,440
have a problem eating cauliflower

309
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,440
i see people who can't touch a lemon i

310
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,480
see people have you know it's all that

311
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,920
kind of stuff so

312
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,600
check out all those different things so

313
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,000
what i would do if i was swelling and it

314
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,160
was

315
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
tomato and i had a mouth swell from

316
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,640
tomato itself

317
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
i would get rid of other things in my

318
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,880
that i was eating i would get rid of

319
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
milk cheese

320
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:37,680
butter gluten eggs gone i would look out

321
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,279
to make sure i was doing no msg no

322
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,200
natural flavors in anything

323
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:42,560
no apple cider vinegar no nutritional

324
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,600
yeast and no caffeine

325
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:47,040
get rid of all that then and i would

326
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,839
even probably get rid of chocolate and

327
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,920
then

328
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:52,399
after about a month being free from all

329
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:54,320
that you try a piece of tomato

330
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,760
if you want or your doctor wants you to

331
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,279
you ask your doctor what's right for you

332
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,000
but that's what i would do if it was for

333
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,200
me

334
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,839
that's what i would do because what

335
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:04,959
happens is tomatoes

336
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:08,000
are anti-viral and for some people

337
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:09,120
they do some serious viral like

338
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,240
cleansing

339
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:14,399
even viral killing and when that happens

340
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,519
you could have an h pylori in your gut

341
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,320
and the reason why you're getting

342
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,240
swelling

343
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,160
is because the tomatoes starting to

344
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,000
whack that h pylori you can have a

345
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,240
little streptococcus in your gut

346
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,680
e coli and that tomatoes whacking that

347
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,120
strep and that e coli

348
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,360
so i just want to cover it's a really

349
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,040
good topic i love when someone brings it

350
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,760
up so i can help other people

351
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,360
awesome okay you guys let's start making

352
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,560
some stuff we'll talk about blood draw

353
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:40,160
too

354
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:43,279
so um when it comes down to blood draw

355
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,680
all right you have to know that they

356
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:46,959
take

357
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,680
too much blood for what they're looking

358
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:50,880
for

359
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:52,079
they throw all the blood away they take

360
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,760
a little bit of blood

361
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:55,440
they draw a nice tube of it and they

362
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,120
take a little bit of blood and they

363
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:00,160
throw it they discard it

364
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,440
at least you think they're throwing it

365
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,480
away

366
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,240
what if they're not throwing it away i

367
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,160
was talking to someone the other day

368
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,360
because they heard me talking about this

369
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:12,800
and they're like well you know aw what

370
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,480
if they're not throwing it away

371
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,160
i said yeah they could be using that

372
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,560
stuff for genetic testing meaning

373
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:21,279
genetic messing

374
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:23,360
playing with genes they can be using

375
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:26,480
that stuff for a lot of reasons

376
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:30,160
absolutely because why else would they

377
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:33,600
ask this why else aw would they be

378
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,800
drawing so much blood they don't need to

379
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,000
draw

380
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:41,040
why would they do that if they weren't

381
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,360
using it for something that was somebody

382
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:46,480
asking me that question right

383
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:49,600
i was like hey hey who knows who knows

384
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:51,200
okay that's right no one does anything

385
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,079
dirty and horrible out there oh that's

386
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,760
right

387
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:56,000
science of research never did anything

388
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,839
wrong oh that's right they're angels

389
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
everybody who works for them is angels

390
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,639
the people at the top they're all angels

391
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,240
anyway

392
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:03,680
let's talk about blood draw okay

393
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,279
everything else is rotten in the world

394
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,320
there's corruption everywhere but not

395
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,600
there

396
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,320
let's talk about this now we'll go to

397
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:12,079
page 197 right here so

398
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,920
it's all interesting stuff you know it

399
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:17,279
makes you think really and that's that's

400
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:18,639
that's something too kind of giving you

401
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:21,760
i'm in the new book right now if you

so i'm in a new book

404
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:31,519
and we're having some fun so

405
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,320
i'm in page 197 on the medical medium

406
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,760
new edition

407
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,760
just so you guys know i'm talking about

408
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:38,720
blood draw information

409
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,600
and it's important to know that that

410
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,800
when you get

411
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:45,920
your blood test ask your doctor for less

412
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:48,480
blood go in there more frequently or go

413
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,920
to the to the blood lab place more

414
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,720
frequently

415
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,480
um and be cautious to how much now if i

416
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,880
was gonna get blood work

417
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,600
you know i wouldn't let more than three

418
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,160
vials

419
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,519
out the gate that's that's for for you

420
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:04,800
know what i would do

421
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:06,480
and i would even do two vials so you

422
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,000
tell your doctor get what you can get

423
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,720
out of two vials

424
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,760
get what you can get out of three vials

425
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,720
right

426
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:16,079
and then i'll come back another day

427
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,360
because what happens is

428
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:22,399
your white count is in that blood

429
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:25,519
your white count is keeping all of your

430
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:27,560
autoimmune in check because everybody's

431
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:30,079
going to be diagnosed with autoimmune

432
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:30,880
everybody out there i don't care who it

433
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:34,240
is

434
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:36,720
eventually mark my words every

435
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,480
single human on this planet is going to

436
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,560
get an autoimmune diagnosis

437
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,680
as the years go by just telling you

438
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:45,040
right now

439
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,600
some earlier than later some later than

440
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,800
earlier

441
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,600
all depends so i want to show you some

442
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,639
stuff here so

443
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:55,440
anyway this is

444
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,560
um a white blood cell okay that's your

445
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,600
white blood cell

446
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:02,639
so it's floating around in your

447
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:05,920
bloodstream that's a virus

448
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:08,959
okay the viruses they

449
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:10,720
mainly stay inside your organs and i

450
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:12,240
know that some people will say

451
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,000
wait a minute if you're getting your

452
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,639
blood drawn out and your white

453
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,600
count your killer cells are all being

454
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:21,440
taken out

455
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:24,240
because you're taking 5 7 10 12 14 vials

456
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:26,000
and it's being taken out right well the

457
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,000
viruses that are in your bloodstream

458
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,160
they're going to be taken out too with

459
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,920
it so it's kind of one for one tip for a

460
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,839
tat right or equal ground

461
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:36,160
you're taking just as much white count

462
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:38,399
out as you're taking viruses out

463
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,759
so you end up with less viruses you end

464
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:42,079
up with less immune system

465
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:43,600
we're okay cancels out each other not

466
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:46,639
how it works

467
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,000
not how it works at all the viruses they

468
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:50,639
live inside your liver

469
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
they live inside your organs they live

470
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,320
inside your spleen

471
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,079
they live inside your pancreas they live

472
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:59,839
inside the intestinal

473
00:15:56,079 --> 00:16:03,040
linings they live inside

474
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:06,240
tissue all through the body okay

475
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,600
and they live on nerves they even live

476
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,279
on nerves

477
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,800
vagus neurophrenic nerve all kinds of

478
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:14,160
nerves right

479
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:15,279
but and your white count is swimming

480
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:20,320
around

481
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:23,360
making sure making sure

482
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,000
that that virus doesn't get out of the

483
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,160
gate

484
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,839
so when the virus wants to peek its head

485
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:30,320
out of your out of your liver

486
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,880
and it wants to make a run for it to

487
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,920
then

488
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:37,199
blow up and explode meaning blow up and

489
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:39,199
and and proliferate and start to spread

490
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:40,240
what it does your white count is keeping

491
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,680
all that in check

492
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,000
so the white counts going through your

493
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,680
bloodstream hey you want to peek out of

494
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,600
the liver today you're not gonna

495
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:50,079
just just starts to tear apart that

496
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,079
virus the virus wants to pop out

497
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:53,920
of your spleen the white count is

498
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:56,480
swimming around in your bloodstream

499
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:58,240
finds it tears it down keeps it down

500
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,000
your viruses because everybody's got

501
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,639
viruses inside of them

502
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,880
know that there's an armed guard always

503
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,880
in the bloodstream floating around

504
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,160
floating around and there's things that

505
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,919
drop our immune system

506
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,520
lots of things there's betrayal broken

507
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,520
trust broken heart

508
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,919
hardship emotional abuse emotional

509
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:18,240
hardship all of that knocks down

510
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:20,079
the immune system adrenaline fight or

511
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,559
flight caffeine

512
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,919
really hits the immune system hard right

513
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:25,439
so there's all this stuff that hits the

514
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:27,520
immune system and then we're not eating

515
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,799
foods that build up our immune system

516
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:32,720
right

517
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:35,200
and then then the worst of all

518
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,240
the blood tests that's when they take

519
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,280
your immune system

520
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,240
out of your body and then it takes weeks

521
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,400
and sometimes

522
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:45,440
months to get your immune system back up

523
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:47,919
to par they pull all that blood out

524
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,600
right they pull all that blood out which

525
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:52,720
is your white count

526
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:54,160
and then the viruses they got free game

527
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,880
and then that means a couple of months

528
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,720
later my lupus is worse or i just got

529
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,600
diagnosed with lupus and i never had it

530
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,160
before

531
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,039
or now my hashimoto's is going to a new

532
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,600
level

533
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:07,039
and i want to talk about this in regards

534
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,640
to cancer

535
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:10,160
this is important when it comes down to

536
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,160
cancer okay

537
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,240
getting large blood draws constantly

538
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:17,600
because of cancer

539
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:20,480
it's a nightmare a nightmare

540
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,679
and i mean i have a you know family

541
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,880
friend

542
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:27,200
family friend right say like you know

543
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,400
what do we do what do we do like you get

544
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,160
small

545
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,440
you know this is you you do what your

546
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,559
doctor tells you okay whatever your

547
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,480
doctor tells you it's what you do but

548
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:38,160
this is what i told family friend

549
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:42,320
small blood vials periodically

550
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:44,640
versus larger ones you know at one time

551
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:46,000
because when it comes down to cancer you

552
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,919
need your white count

553
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
you need it to be strong and you need it

554
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:51,600
to be actually keeping things in check

555
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,840
and under control

556
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,039
really important really important so i'm

557
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,000
going to read just a little bit out of

558
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:59,280
medical medium right

559
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,960
here for a second

560
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,960
okay you guys and um

561
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:08,640

00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:13,360
um of any kind

564
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,240
eczema psoriasis hashimoto's thyroiditis

565
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,400
ra lupus

566
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,919
ms lyme disease lyme disease now now is

567
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,200
autoimmune it's not bacterial

568
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,039
thanks to this book right here if you

569
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,720
guys just came on here this book has

570
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:24,240
changed how they view lyme disease now

571
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,720
medical research and science took the

572
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,559
cue from the book

573
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,160
took the information and now lyme

574
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:31,120
disease is in the autoimmune category

575
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:34,559
which means viral

576
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:36,799
which isn't bacterial anymore and

577
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:38,320
so any kind of condition you get

578
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:40,160
diagnosed with

579
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,760
and say you're not diagnosed with a

580
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,200
condition you guys say you're not

581
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,960
there's no diagnoses

582
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,400
tingles and numbness you got a little

583
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,640
vertigo dizziness

584
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,600
focus and concentration maybe you can't

585
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,280
see good you know

586
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,880
something's going on there whatever it

587
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:56,160
is that's happening in your

588
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,600
life whatever it is okay whatever

589
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,039
symptoms migraines

590
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,039
body aches and pains a little bit

591
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:03,440
fatigue all can worsen

592
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:04,480
all of it anxiety i've seen people get

593
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,320
too much blood drawn

594
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,679
and their anxiety becomes from from

595
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:11,280
level 1

596
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:14,320
to level 10 and now they're crippled

597
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:17,360
crippled with anxiety because

598
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:20,799
when you remove your immune system

599
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:23,120
it takes time to rebuild it over again

600
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:23,840
and there's not a lot of quick ways to

601
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,760
do it

602
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:28,159
because no one's going to be doing

603
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:30,240
medical medium to the 100th degree

604
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:31,919
a lot of people dabble in it a lot of

605
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,400
people dabble in medical medium they're

606
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:36,080
playing with it they do the celery juice

607
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,000
they do a little this they do a little

608
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,679
that and then they're doing apple cider

609
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,640
vinegar nutritional yeast charcoal

610
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:41,840
colostrum

611
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,280
collagen they're doing all the stuff

612
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,720
that breaks down the immune system

613
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,480
they're doing caffeine but they're

614
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,960
saying they're doing mm

615
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,919
so in order to build that blood up quick

616
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,559
you got to really

617
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:53,840
stick to mm stuff for sure but the

618
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:56,320
bottom line is

619
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:57,200
you know it doesn't happen really like

620
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,720
that it takes

621
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:03,280
time takes time to actually rebuild your

622
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:06,400
immune system and so

623
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:08,880
and that's the problem there um so

624
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,679
what i would do is small amounts it's

625
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,760
not about

626
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:13,760
fear it's not about never get a blood

627
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:17,039
test it's not about being scared

628
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:19,200
it's either i watch your back and and

629
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:20,480

00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,840
podcast doctors do

636
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,600
because what they do is it's always

637
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,520
about just always about

638
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,960
you know people pleasing a little bit

639
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:40,400
and this and that right

640
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:43,440
it's all about that and it's not about

641
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,559
here it is how can we protect you how

642
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,440

children and your life and

647
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:56,000
heal because what happens is what i've

648
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,880
seen

649
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,679
for for over 30 plus years 35 years

650
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:03,840
really

651
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:06,480
i've seen people recovering recovering

652
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,600
recovering they're getting there to the

653
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,880
finish line

654
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,120
they're recovering from multiple

655
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:13,280
sclerosis and they're making it

656
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,559
and then boom they had a 14 vial blood

657
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,880
draw

658
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:17,679
back in the saddle again back in the

659
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,240
saddle again

660
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:21,360
now we got to go to recovering

661
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,559
recovering

662
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:25,600
recovering recovering seven vial blood

663
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:27,760
draw boom

664
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,360
kick back notch even if it comes two

665
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,000
months later three months later five

666
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:33,120
months later

667
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,200
boom kicked back recovering recovering

668
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:37,440
having a harder time recovering now

669
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,400
because the body just went what the heck

670
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,919
recovering

671
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:45,440
another five vials another 10 vials

672
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:46,400
it's it's horrifying and no doctor

673
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,440
realizes it

674
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:51,600
no doctor knows about it then unless

675
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:54,720
they've learned from medical medium

676
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:58,960
and you know it's really it's really sad

677
00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:01,039
this is why it's so important so

678
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,320
tanya says what does it mean when the

679
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:04,320
test comes back

680
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:07,120
and they say there was too much white

681
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,960
blood cell in the blood

682
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,320
first of all when you get a blood test

683
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,480
and something's

684
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:14,320
something's high in your your white

685
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,760
count say your white counts hot

686
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,840
whatever they can average your white

687
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:19,360
count the basophils neutrophils

688
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,280
you know lymphocytes whatever they want

689
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,000
to do right monocytes whatever they want

690
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,240
to average

691
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,600
out with your white with your white

692
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,039
count right

693
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,799
killer cells however they want to

694
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:30,080
average it some doctors average it

695
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:31,600
differently some look at it differently

696
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,960
i've seen virologists look at blood work

697
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:36,000
differently right

698
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:39,200
and but when the white counts up

699
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,440
that means low-grade viral infection

700
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,279
that's what that means low-grade viral

701
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,559
infection that's what i've always taught

702
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:46,000
doctors through the years

703
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:47,760
it's the number one question i've had

704
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,240
doctors ask me throughout the years you

705
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,919
know

706
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,440
it's like you know what's going on with

707
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:52,880
this white count you know what can we

708
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,400
see what could we not see and what

709
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,919
happens is in a lot of people that have

710
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,480
their elevated white count

711
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:59,679
they got some viruses inside the liver

712
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,440
they got that happening

713
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:02,720
where they got the bugs inside the liver

714
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,320
a little bit of an elevation of

715
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,240
low-grade viral infection

716
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:08,240
or their white count is in the process

717
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,720
of destroying an epstein-barr virus

718
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:12,559
epstein-barr virus is the number one

719
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,679
reason why people get that elevated

720
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:17,120
white count

721
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:20,480
important to know shingles can do it too

722
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:22,159
and and simplex one the cold sore

723
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,240
cold sore people go few my cold sore

724
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:25,600
went away it's just a cold sore well

725
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,520
what happens what people don't know

726
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,880
is it's still in your system and then it

727
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:32,640
causes some trouble so it's good to be

728
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:34,400
anti-viral and that's the thing about

729
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:38,000
the medical medium new edition

730
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,960
it's an anti-viral book in its greatest

731
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
sense

732
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,720
and and so important to know it really

733
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,559
is

734
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,960
good question michelle what about what

735
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:49,200
about um what about low white count

736
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,400
same thing low grade viral infections

737
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,120
with low white count

738
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,799
because the because the white count was

739
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:57,840
maxed at one point

740
00:24:54,799 --> 00:25:00,640
and then it lost some steam and then it

741
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:02,480
maxes and loses some steam and the thing

742
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,880
is with blood work anyway

743
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,679
any given day it could change so he gets

744
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,320
your blood test

745
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:10,480
one time one month two months later you

746
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,520
get it tested again

747
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,440
it's different than what it would have

748
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:15,279
been a day later or three days later or

749
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,720
five days later it's always changing and

750
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,919
ebbing and flowing for a lot of people

751
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,159
but low white count

752
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:22,000
low weight count what that is is usually

753
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,720
a little extra toxic heavy metals which

754
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,039
actually

755
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,880
lowers the red blood cells too so it

756
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:29,679
lowers those babies

757
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:31,520
and and the thing is is you know red

758
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:33,600
blood cells you get your blood drawn

759
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,720
you get trouble with the red blood cells

760
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:38,240
you get the trouble with the

761
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:41,360
white blood cells right and below

762
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,400
white count is is indicative to the

763
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,559
whole thing if it was

764
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,799
high at one point and then it got

765
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:48,320
drained the immune the immune system got

766
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:49,760
low it got lower it got lower it's

767
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,279
getting drained because it's battling

768
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:53,279
low-grade viral infections

769
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:55,120
you ask your doctor about you know take

770
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:56,559
the medical medium books to the doctor

771
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,000
you ask them all the questions you want

772
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:59,440
to ask them show them the book that's

773
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,880
what happened with this one it was shown

774
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:03,520
to doctors around the world

775
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,400
for the last six and a half seven years

776
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:07,039
however it is

777
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,799
um so anyway you guys i'm here i'm

778
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:10,000
making a mango salad but haven't started

779
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:11,600
yet talking about blood draw

780
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,039
how serious it is when you get your

781
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,640
blood test um

782
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:16,320
and here's here's why i'm talking about

783
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,880
it so much today okay

784
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,080
so here's one reason why i'm bringing

785
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,279
this up for someone reading some

786
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:24,320
questions

787
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:26,799
vivian says what about if the celery

788
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:29,520
causes high blood pressure what can i do

789
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:31,919
to stop the blood pressure from going up

790
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:33,520
um that's you be your own detective is

791
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:34,400
it really the celery causing high blood

792
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,400
pressure

793
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,159
um nothing else caused it you never had

794
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:40,240
high blood pressure before

795
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:41,760
um what happens when you don't do celery

796
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,640
at all do you ever have high blood

797
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:45,200
pressure

798
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:47,039
um if i had high blood pressure uh

799
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,919
because celery juice lowers high blood

800
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,679
pressure right

801
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:51,440
so but and that's what it's that's what

802
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:53,679
it's proven to do out there but what

803
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:56,400
i would do if i had high blood pressure

804
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:58,080
is i would lower fats

805
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,600
i would make sure there's no milk cheese

806
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,440
butter and eggs in there if you're

807
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,159
eating animal protein only eat it once a

808
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,400
day

809
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:06,480
if you're eating plant fats like avocado

810
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,799
nuts seeds nut butters nut milks

811
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,159
lower them i would lower them so your

812
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:13,120
blood isn't so

813
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:14,559
thick and stagnant and the liver gets a

814
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,080
break and then you start healing the

815
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:17,200
liver and then blood pressure problems

816
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:20,640
that are mysterious

817
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:22,240
go away ask your doctor take

818
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,600
take take the book to your doctor go to

819
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,559
library if you don't want to buy it it's

820
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,679
going to come out in the library i'm

821
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:27,200
sure eventually

822
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:29,120
get the la get it in the library for

823
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,480
free and and take it to your doctor

824
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:33,039
ask them about your high blood pressure

825
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:35,039
show them the book um

826
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:36,320
ask him any questions you find any any

827
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:39,039
you know things that you find in here

828
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,039
that you want to ask

829
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:45,520
so anyway you guys allison said you said

830
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,880
two or three tubes yes sometimes the

831
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,159
tubes are larger sometimes you're

832
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,360
smaller you don't know which one you're

833
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:50,480
gonna get you don't know which one

834
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,840
they're gonna take

835
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,520
sometimes they'll surprise you they'll

836
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,159
take the large ones sometimes surprise

837
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,480
you they'll take

838
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:57,520
more of a smaller tube but i'd say two

839
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:00,399
to three tubes

840
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:02,320
that's what i would do for max but

841
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:02,960
really if you're sensitive two to three

842
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,279
tubes

843
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,480
that's my recommendation ask your doctor

844
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:09,440
do what's right for you

845
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,399
you know with your doctor um and i would

846
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,039
even ask for

847
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:14,399
half tubes so the phlebotomist said it'd

848
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:16,960
be like oh half tubes

849
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:18,000
can we do half tubes and i would ask

850
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,159
your doctor can i get

851
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,240
half tubes now the blood labs would be

852
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:24,399
like we don't want half tubes but they

853
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,679
but but they're fine with it when it

854
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:28,240
does go through

855
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:29,200
and one doctor says okay let's do half

856
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:32,559
half tubes

857
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:35,279
so instead of eight you know full

858
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:36,480
tubes we do really at equals to four

859
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,520
food full tubes

860
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,919
instead of eight because you're getting

861
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,799
half tubes right and it goes to the

862
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:43,679
blood lab

863
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:45,520
and the blood lab is fine and runs it so

864
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:47,200
when you hear about the blood lab won't

865
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,480
let it they won't let it go

866
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,960
they're they're just they're being

867
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,080
ridiculous because they're only using a

868
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,240
smidgen

869
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:55,600
and they're throwing it all away

870
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,159
smidging and they're throwing it all

871
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,600
away

872
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:00,320
now look you guys why would i take this

873
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,320
serious

874
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,520
like why would i want to talk about this

875
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:06,880
because

876
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:08,880
it can mean life or death for a lot of

877
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:11,840
very sick people that are chronically

878
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:14,559
ill fighting their way back

879
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:15,760
from hell and they mean lyme disease

880
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:17,600
really bad ms

881
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,200
lupus or you're somebody that just gets

882
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,960
headaches you're sensitive

883
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,399
because you've got a low grade shingles

884
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,600
without knowing it you've got something

885
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:24,799
else without knowing and say you got

886
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,000
sibo

887
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:28,720
you don't know it you're walking around

888
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,520
sibo and h h pylori and streptococcus in

889
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,760
your gut

890
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:33,120
and you got some sibo and stuff and and

891
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:35,600
you know the blood draw

892
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,399
affects us and here's the thing you have

893
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,880
to know

894
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:40,240
one of the most important things what

895
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,840
you're going to hear from functional

896
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:44,240
medicine doctors what you're going to

897
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:46,279
hear from podcast doctors

898
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:48,080
what you're going to hear from

899
00:29:46,279 --> 00:29:49,840
nutritionists now

900
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,120
you're going to hear parroting right

901
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:54,320
it's like a parrot

902
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:57,200
you know and the parrot says

903
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:58,640
your immune system is all in your gut

904
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,679
that's where your immune system is

905
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,200
that's what you're going to hear from

906
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:02,559
the podcast doctors the functional

907
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,520
medicine doctors

908
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:04,880
you're going to hear that now for

909
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,399
chinese medicine doctors you're just

910
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,440
going to hear it the immune system is

911
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:10,399
all in your gut

912
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,880
that's where your immune system is wrong

913
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:14,000
boom

914
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:15,520
wrong another ridiculous trend and

915
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,000
theory and thought

916
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:19,360
in the system which sends everybody you

917
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,039
know in the wrong direction

918
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,799
your immune system is not all in your

919
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:23,600
gut that's not where most of your immune

920
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:26,960
system is

921
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:28,559
completely 100 inaccurate and wrong

922
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,000
bottom line okay you know where your

923
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:32,799
immune system is

924
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,399
it's in your bloodstream that's where

925
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:37,840
your immune system is

926
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:41,039
it's in your bloodstream

927
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:43,919
that's where it is that's where they

928
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:46,720
test for it that's where it is

929
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:47,039
it's in your bloodstream so you don't

930
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,720
get

931
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:53,039
blood poisoning i'll say it again

932
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,760
okay it's not in your gut it's in your

933
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:56,960
bloodstream

934
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:59,200
so you don't get blood poisoning

935
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:00,320
so another ridiculous trend but here's

936
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,080
the thing

937
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:03,840
they're allowed to make ridiculous

938
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:05,600
trends over and over again and as they

939
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:07,039
keep on bombing or hurting people or

940
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,760
bombing or hurting people or being

941
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:10,799
useless

942
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:13,440
no one pays the price it's all like oh

943
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:15,360
move on something else five years ago oh

944
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:17,279
let's move on to something else so let's

945
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,640
change our tune once again let's do

946
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:19,519
another ridiculous trend let's talk

947
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,919
about lectins now

948
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:23,200
that's the new one what's coffee animus

949
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:25,039
let's talk coffee enemas

950
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,559
oh wait a minute here let's do some cold

951
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:29,440
plunging into ice

952
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:30,080
and shock our body so that we live less

953
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,679
longer

954
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:33,360
let's you know because the body gets

955
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:35,039
injured over time from the shock

956
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:37,200
let's do all kinds of things and that's

957
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:41,039
what happens the ridiculous trends come

958
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:42,399
flying in and and should people just you

959
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:43,600
know and they don't do it

960
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:45,360
you know before medical medium

961
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,880
information you guys came around before

962
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,919
medical medium information got in the

963
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:50,320
books too

964
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:52,240
before that everybody swam in all those

965
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,360
ridiculous trends misinformation and

966
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,360
theories right

967
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:57,120
they didn't have mm info to pull them

968
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:58,880
out but now it's mixing up

969
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,559
it's mixing they're taking medical

970
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,519
medium information they're sticking it

971
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:03,519
in with all those

972
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:05,600
while doing all that other useless stuff

973
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:08,559
and then people get a little bit better

974
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:10,480
and it's the mm celery juice it's it's

975
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:12,399
the m it's lowering the fats

976
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,919
intermittent fasting is lowering the

977
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:15,120
fats that's making sure you don't do

978
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:16,640
fats in the morning

979
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,559
that alone is helping people a little

980
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,200
bit even though it's not quite right

981
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:21,440
done

982
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,600
but the bottom line is and then the

983
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,880
epstein-barr reactivation of epsom bars

984
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:27,519
medical medium information

985
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,000
it was in this book first so i want to

986
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:29,919
read a little

987
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,679
bit about the blood draw when a larger

988
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:33,360
number of blood vials are

989
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:35,279
drawn it could be stressful on the

990
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:37,519
immune system

991
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:39,519
because the very immune defenses that

992
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:40,559
are keeping the viruses behind lyme

993
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:42,159
symptoms at bay

994
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:43,679
and other chronic illness symptoms at

995
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:46,240
bay are being drawn

996
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:47,039
out of the body with the blood that's

997
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:50,320
taken

998
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:53,120
your white count gets drawn out you get

999
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:55,519
sicker as you go along down the road

1000
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:57,279
and yeah you're young doesn't feel

1001
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:59,039
there's no problems you're you know

1002
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:00,960
young and you're you feel indestructible

1003
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:02,559
but you only got some acne and

1004
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,000
maybe a little you're a little tired a

1005
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:06,000
little brain fog

1006
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,919
but it's gonna hurt you when it's done

1007
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,399
wrong and they keep on vamping that

1008
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:12,000
blood

1009
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:15,039
out of you okay so

1010
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,039
larger blood draws

1011
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:18,480
tend to take away a substantial portion

1012
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:22,240
of a person's immune system

1013
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:24,320
that day yeah and it sometimes takes

1014
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:26,080
weeks and even longer to rebuild those

1015
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:29,039
portions of the immune system

1016
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:31,120
within those weeks that the full power

1017
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:34,159
of the immune system is not present to

1018
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:37,519
monitor the blood in organs

1019
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:40,399
right not present viruses can get

1020
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:41,279
in a window get a window to strengthen

1021
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:43,279
and proliferate

1022
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:44,880
infections can travel from organ to

1023
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:47,120
organ with ease

1024
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,799
because they're not being corralled by

1025
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,559
your immune system anymore

1026
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:52,799
and that can lead to a flare up of

1027
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:54,159
symptoms whether a week later a few

1028
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:56,799
weeks later months later

1029
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:58,799
or even a year later i recommend doing

1030
00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:00,880
smaller blood draws

1031
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:02,480
over more visits if you're struggling

1032
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:05,519
with lyme symptoms

1033
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:06,080
ra focus and concentration migraines

1034
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:07,519
anxiety

1035
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,440
depression whatever you're struggling

1036
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:11,919
with eczema psoriasis

1037
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:13,599
i recommend no more than four vials of

1038
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:15,679
blood at a time

1039
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:17,679
and even consider fewer if you're very

1040
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:19,280
sensitive a mistake made by well-meaning

1041
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:21,200
doctors is to draw a large number of

1042
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:24,240
blood vials with sensitive people

1043
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:25,839
even ask for half blood vials anyway

1044
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:27,440
i'm reading medical medium new edition

00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:28,480

appreciate it eileen

1080
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,760
i guess we don't get the answer about

1081
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:06,400
donating blood

1082
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,680
yeah i'll talk about it i'll talk about

1083
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:12,560
it

1084
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:14,079
um first of all

1085
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:16,480
if you're sensitive you got chronic

1086
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:17,200
illness you got any kind of epstein-barr

1087
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:20,400
related

1088
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:23,359
symptoms and conditions

1089
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:24,400
um if you're somebody with fatigue

1090
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:28,240
eczema

1091
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:30,640
aches and pains um

1092
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:31,520
somebody with you know with high anxiety

1093
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:34,400
depression

1094
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:37,200
anything somebody with an autoimmune

1095
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:40,720
diagnosis or maybe just a rosacea

1096
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:41,040
dermatitis um you know anything like

1097
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,119
that

1098
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:44,720
maybe you've had symptoms before tinkles

1099
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:48,880
and numbness

1100
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:51,680
whatever it is you want to be cautious

1101
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:52,640
about donating blood because you get rid

1102
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:55,440
of a lot of blood

1103
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:57,200
you get rid of your immune system and

1104
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,040
then you can become a sick person

1105
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:01,599
a real sick person who's going to need

1106
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:03,440
someone to donate blood to

1107
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:05,040
and so kind of think about that and be

1108
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:07,359
cautious because

1109
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,560
if you get too much blood drawn and too

1110
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:10,480
much blood drawn

1111
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,960
and you're sick you can end up really

1112
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:15,760
release it because i've seen it happen

1113
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:17,599
and um and then now you're now you're

1114
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:20,640
you're needing blood

1115
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:21,280
yourself absolutely it's one thing to

1116
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:24,400
think about

1117
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:26,400

1118
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:28,240

00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:37,599
right another thing is too um yeah you

1124
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,359
can donate blood

1125
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:40,880
absolutely it's it's a noble thing to do

1126
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:45,200
it's a great thing to do

1127
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:46,880
um maybe you can donate smaller batches

1128
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:50,800
maybe you can find out about that and

1129
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:53,599
look into it smaller batches

1130
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,240
also be really proactive when you donate

1131
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:56,800
blood

1132
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:58,960
be careful don't don't push yourself

1133
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:00,560
hard for a week afterwards

1134
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:02,560
make sure you're taking good care of

1135
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:05,599
yourself staying hydrated

1136
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:06,480

zinc

1138
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:10,000
ask your doctor if that's right for you

1139
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,680
okay but i would if i was donating blood

1140
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,960
i'd be on zinc

1141
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:17,440

his methods work incredible incredible

1172
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:28,079
cutting up some some cauliflower right

1173
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:29,599
here right now

1174
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:32,960
putting that in here i'm cutting the

1175
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:34,560
pieces not so small not so big

1176
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:36,480
that's how i got lime from a blood

1177
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:38,480
transfusion shannon bentley that's how i

1178
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:41,040
got lime from blood transfusion

1179
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:42,400
um my concern is when you donate blood

1180
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,599
and you have that reactivated

1181
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,280
epstein-barr and they don't know you

1182
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:46,880
have reactivated epstein-barr then you

1183
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:48,400
donate blood then that reactivated

1184
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,079
epstein-barr goes into somebody else but

1185
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,920
yet we need people to donate blood

1186
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:53,440
because of critical situations

1187
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:55,200
surgeries heart surgeries and all kinds

1188
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:56,480
of different stuff and i completely

1189
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:58,240
understand that

1190
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:00,000
but if you're donating blood maybe

1191
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:02,079
donate less maybe

1192
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,839
really take care of yourself for a week

1193
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:07,359
or two after

1194
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:11,920
i if okay this is a good way of doing it

1195
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:14,079
say i was gonna donate blood all right

1196
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:15,760
well what i would do is make sure i

1197
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:19,680
wasn't eating any

1198
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:22,400
of these right here any time before

1199
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:24,079
like a month before and anytime after i

1200
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:27,200
would not eat these eggs right here

1201
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:28,400
okay that i would not do no eggs no milk

1202
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,680
cheese no butter

1203
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,839
i would keep that away i would keep

1204
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:33,359
gluten away at least keep those foods

1205
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:36,720
away if you're going to donate blood

1206
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:38,480
that's something to consider right there

1207
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:41,359
and i suggest never eating those at all

1208
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:42,400
eggs for for sure i suggest never eating

1209
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:44,400
those anyway

1210
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:46,800
cutting up some florets some cauliflower

1211
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,800
right here

1212
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,880
it's one thing i do i make sure i would

1213
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:53,280
be taking zinc

1214
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:54,880
i would be taking some goldenseal i'd be

1215
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,640
taking the vimorji stuff personally

1216
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:59,680
that's what i would be doing

1217
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:03,040
um i'd be taking lemon balm that's what

1218
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:05,440
i'd be doing i'd be taking antivirals

1219
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:06,800
vitamin c i'd be taking a lot of vitamin

1220
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:09,040
c so if i

1221
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:10,319
try to donate blood at least i had a lot

1222
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:12,400
of vitamin c in me

1223
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:13,599
that was feeding what was left of my

1224
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,760
immune system

1225
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:17,119
so here i'm going to donate some blood

1226
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:19,119
they're taking it out

1227
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:20,720
right and meanwhile i took vitamin c

1228
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:22,560

gobble down vitamin c

1232
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,520
which i think i put it over there but

1233
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:35,359
that's what i would do

1234
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:39,119
i mean definitely what i do um

1235
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:39,119

1249
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:11,599
i'm not trying to put fear in anybody

1250
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,000
but i know a lot of people that were

1251
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,680
happy they got this

1252
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,200
information throughout the years when i

1253
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:22,720
taught it

1254
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:25,040
one-on-one a lot of people were happy

1255
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:26,319
it protected a lot of people so they can

1256
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:28,720
be safe

1257
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:30,960
they got smaller blood draws their

1258
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:33,119
immune system was preserved

1259
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:35,200
and they kept fighting forward healing

1260
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:37,040
instead of getting vamped

1261
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,960
instead of it all being taken out of

1262
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:40,960
them vampires

1263
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:44,160

1269
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,720

food

1287
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:38,560
i talk about it i think the detox was

1288
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:40,960
too much for my adrenals which caused my

1289
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:43,040
blood pressure to rise and i became

1290
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:45,520
really weak i crashed i had to quit

1291
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:47,760
celery juice and doing better

1292
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,760
um

1293
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:56,400
nancy uh so

1294
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:57,599
are you doing any antivirals are you

1295
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,440
doing what kind of what kind of

1296
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:02,400
protocols are you doing

1297
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,960
um when someone's really toxic or really

1298
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:06,079
really

1299
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:07,760
viral you know that they can have

1300
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:09,200
all kinds of things can happen when

1301
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:10,960
you're healing and flushing the stuff

1302
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:14,960
out of your system

1303
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:18,720
um but celery juice is really really

1304
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:21,839
gentle it's gentle very very gentle

1305
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:23,280
um why don't you i mean you don't have

1306
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:25,200
look ask your doctor what's right for

1307
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:26,319
you

1308
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,920
that's what i would do why don't you ask

1309
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:30,079
your doctor but if it was me i'd go down

1310
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:31,520
to four ounces of celery juice

1311
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:35,119
i mean that's what i would do but ask

1312
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:35,119
your doctor what you what you should do

1313
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,839
so

1314
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:42,480
cutting some more mangoes here we'll see

1315
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:44,480
if we get some more good ones that's a

1316
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:46,720
really nice one right there

1317
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:48,960
if it was up to me i would work up the

1318
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:50,240
dosage that's what i would do

1319
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:53,599
trying to pay attention so i don't cut

1320
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:55,359
my hand of course got another mango here

1321
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:58,560
i would work up start with four ounces

1322
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:58,560
start working my way up

1323
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:04,560
another thing too if you're detoxing

1324
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:06,079
okay what else are you doing and what

1325
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:07,119
else are you eating are you eating

1326
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:08,400
enough

1327
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:11,040
could have nothing to do with the celery

1328
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:12,960
juice are you eating enough

1329
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:15,040
did you go without food too much are you

1330
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:18,319
on so little calories

1331
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:20,800
are your calories enough

1332
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:22,400
because really it sounds to me like not

1333
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:23,760
enough calories going on

1334
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:25,200
might have been eating smaller portions

1335
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,560
of something or not eating enough

1336
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,920
frequently enough especially if you have

1337
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:33,520
adrenal issues

1338
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:37,760
especially if you're adrenal sensitive

1339
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:37,760
um i'm putting some more mango in here

1340
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:47,839

onions some people like it i still got

1347
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:05,680
radishes to go that's a healing food

1348
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:07,359
radishes are antiviral green onions are

1349
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:09,040
antiviral

1350
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:11,520

00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:11,520
right now

1352
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:16,000
now i don't want them too small and i

1353
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:19,119

radish

1365
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:50,160
because i like to throw things in the

1366
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:53,359
air

1367
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:54,400
the habit i picked up throughout the

1368
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:57,839
years anybody

1369
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:57,839

i had 15 vials and it makes me sad and

1411
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:49,760
cry to think

1412
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:51,280
they harmed me well here it is they're

1413
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,720
not doing it on purpose

1414
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:55,040
it's just that science research is

1415
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:56,960
behind on a lot of information

1416
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:58,720
and now you know how to protect yourself

1417
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:00,640
what you do is you ask your doctor can

1418
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:02,640
you do less can you do seven vials

1419
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:03,680
if it's if you know can you do half

1420
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:06,880
vials i mean

1421
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:08,240
i would i would do i would do

1422
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:10,079
if i'm sick and i have any kind of

1423
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:10,480
condition if i had any kind of symptom

1424
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:12,079
or

1425
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:14,559
aches and pains or condition i would

1426
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:16,400
personally do two to three vials

1427
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:17,520
at a time i'd say to my doctor what can

1428
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,640
you get out of three vials because

1429
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:19,280
that's what i'm that's what i'm going to

1430
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:21,680
give you

1431
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:22,960
i think we okay well we'll schedule they

1432
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:25,040
just here's what it is

1433
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:26,880
they want it all all at once they don't

1434
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:28,960
want to have to think

1435
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:30,720
that you know the doctor doesn't want to

1436
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:31,119
have to think what he has to divide the

1437
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:35,280
test

1438
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:38,640
in it's a hassle right so you become

1439
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:38,960
anybody becomes like either you take the

1440
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:40,559
hit

1441
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:42,160
because the doctor doesn't want the

1442
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:44,400
hassle that's all so

1443
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:45,359
let me get it all done in one boom out

1444
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:47,040
the door

1445
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:48,960
instead of doctor being like okay let me

1446
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:50,079
divide this let me check out your

1447
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:52,160
thyroid

1448
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:53,839
right check out some of your white count

check out your thyroid that should be

1453
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:02,640
enough let's do a few vials

1454
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:04,160
and then we'll come back and we'll check

1455
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:05,599
out hormones we'll check out this we'll

1456
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:06,960

another three vials that day

1459
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:12,400
now you're protected but yet it's a

1460
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:15,680
hassle for the doctor you see

1461
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:15,680
to do that to break it up

1462
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:20,319
suzanne doctors all told me i need to

1463
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:22,000

radioactive iodine and a lot of people

1479
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,119
who did the radioactive iodine

1480
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:53,200
were able still to bring some of the

1481
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:54,000
thyroid back and and sometimes totally

1482
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:56,079

anything else

1621
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:16,880
in the healing arts anything there's

1622
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:18,640
nothing else

1623
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:20,799
in the healing arts that people are

1624
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:23,440
doing more than drinking celery juice

1625
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:26,000
stores run out thousands and thousands

1626
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:27,440
of farms are growing it

1627
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,799
hundreds of thousands of farms around

1628
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:30,960
the world are growing it it's the

1629
00:56:28,799 --> 00:56:31,359
largest crop in every farm but guess

1630
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:34,079
what

1631
00:56:31,359 --> 00:56:35,119
everybody pretends it doesn't exist

1632
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:37,440
because guess why

1633
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:39,440
medical mediums the originator all the

1634
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:39,920
influencers keep it quiet why they drink

1635
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:40,720
it now

1636
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:42,079
they don't want to talk about it

1637
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:43,599
meanwhile they're all drinking it you

1638
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:44,000
can even see it i have people tell me

1639
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:45,920
all the day

1640
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,599
that people are getting caught drinking

1641
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:48,799
it in their youtubes and they're not

1642
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:50,720
saying they are but they're caught

1643
00:56:48,799 --> 00:56:53,520
drinking it every morning like

1644
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:55,040
it's crazy right it is the number one

1645
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:56,640
healing tool in the world right now and

1646
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:58,160
the media doesn't want to touch it

1647
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:59,920
they don't even want to talk about it

1648
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:01,760
because too many people are healing from

1649
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:03,440
it it's too powerful the movement's too

1650
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:05,680
powerful it's too big

1651
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:07,760
and yeah there's a shortage and they're

1652
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:09,119
growing it in truckloads like never

1653
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:11,520
before in history

1654
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:13,359
it's actually just crazy really i think

1655
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:14,079
the influencers don't talk about it as

1656
00:57:13,359 --> 00:57:15,599
much

1657
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:18,000
and youtubers don't talk about it as

1658
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:21,040
much because they can't make

1659
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,839
money off of it you can't make money off

1660
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:25,119
of it it's like

1661
00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:27,280
you juice it you drink it you can't say

1662
00:57:25,119 --> 00:57:28,799
