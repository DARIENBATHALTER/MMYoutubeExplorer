00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,840
tomatoes are really bad for you they can

191
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,919
they're so bad for you they're

192
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,720
problematic that's a mistake all on its

193
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,880
own

194
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,560
and then you get other people in the

195
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:27,520
health movement too

196
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,800
that say hey night shades they're really

197
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,479
bad for you the calls

198
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,160
cause problems they'll cause problems

199
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:33,440
this is a private example why people

200
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,440
don't heal

201
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,199
and sure if you're not so sick and you

202
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,039
get rid of processed foods and you kick

203
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,840
those out when you get rid of the fried

204
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:43,759
greasy foods and you start exercising

205
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,600
and you start juicing something or doing

206
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,080
some green powdered shakes somewhere and

207
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,680
you're

208
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,680
you're in you know you're seeing

209
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,919
improvements you're doing the keto thing

210
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,440
or maybe you go plant-based keto

211
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:55,360
and you're picking up a notch you're

212
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,199
like hey oh wait i got it i got it all

213
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,039
sewed up now

214
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,639
but if you really get sick it doesn't

215
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,080
work that way you'll find that keto it

216
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,840
doesn't work you'll find that even

217
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,680
plant-based vegan doesn't work you'll

218
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,560
find that all these things don't really

219
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,319
work

220
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,039
and then start stuff starts happening

221
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:13,759
your teeth start falling apart over time

222
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:15,199
the weight comes back on and you're out

223
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,199

224
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,720

00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,880
the misinformation that's out there that

you get told not to eat a potato the

but you're being told by people that

247
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:06,720
don't even know why anybody's sick

248
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,160
they don't know why someone's sick with

249
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,479
mystery neurological symptoms

250
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,080
neurological fatigue

251
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:13,520
that's a term for medical medium that's

252
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,039
medical meme information that's got out

253
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,879

information discovered that fatigue was

256
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,720
actually

257
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,240
neuro neurological and then we put that

258
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,240
information out there and published it

259
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,599

260
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:31,599

avoid tomatoes

278
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:03,360

talking about that but so

284
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,120
we got so-called experts out there

285
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,600
shannon

286
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,480
says thank you for getting me over my

287
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,839
nightshade

00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:26,800
fear been enjoying many yummy steamed

289
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,800
potatoes

290
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:34,480
but what happens is we get told you guys

291
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,680
we get told that we should avoid certain

292
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,040
things

293
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,720
and that's what we're told but we're

294
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,080
told by people that don't know why we're

295
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,120
sick

296
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,040
they don't know anything about

297
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,720
epstein-barr unless they learned it from

298
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,080
medical medium

299
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,080
they don't know why any they don't know

300
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,399
anything about viruses unless they

301
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,839
learned it about they learned viruses

302
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,839
from the

303
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,760
plague that's been happening in the last

304
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:59,040
year year and a half

305
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:03,120
a year and whatever a few months so they

306
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:06,320
they now they know the term virus

307
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:09,040
patina says nightshades don't agree with

308
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,959
all of us i break out in eczema but

309
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:15,200
that's only with

310
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:18,160
um auburn's always been that

311
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,600
way since a child even though it was

312
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,079
homegrown

313
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,360
so the thing is with nightshades fatima

314
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,200
is what i've seen

315
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,560
is people don't use them right right

316
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,279
they don't use them really use them

317
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,600
right so

318
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:31,200
what to do is they'll have tomato sauce

319
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,959
filled with all this other bad stuff and

320
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,720
that's aggravating on

321
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:36,640
eczema psoriasis because there's all

322
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,399
this fat in the tomato sauce that's one

323
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,839
thing right there that's a mistake made

324
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,680
they'll take potatoes and they have

325
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:44,640
butter in their potatoes no one eats a

326
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:46,160
plain potato unless it's medical medium

327
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,680
unless it's medical medium information

328
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,399
nobody eats a plain potato

329
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,360
nobody eats a steamed potato nobody even

330
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,279
steams them

331
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,560
if people steam them now it's medical

332
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,160
medium information

333
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,000
very few people i've ever met in the

334
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,800
world out of the hundreds of thousands

335
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,560
i've talked to over the last 35 years

336
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,720
very few people ever just steamed a

337
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:07,920
potato

338
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,760
very few people and so what they do

339
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,120
though is they stick things in potato

340
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,760
and on potato that feed

341
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,760
bugs and then the person gets a problem

342
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,519
and then they think the potato caused it

343
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:20,320
but the potato didn't cause it

344
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:22,399
same thing with tomatoes they'll have

345
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:26,000
chicken parmesan

346
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:29,440
with cheese right mozzarella cheese

347
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,519
sauce they'll have and the sauce

348
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,200
the tomato they'll think to tomatoes

349
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,320
aggravating them when it's not it's all

350
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,120
the fat from the chicken

351
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,040
all the oil thrown in the sauce and then

352
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,040
it's of course the cheese feeding any

353
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:43,360
kind of viruses

354
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,640
and things like that so that's important

355
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,600
to know

356
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,880
if you take a fresh ripe tomato if

357
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,040
you're somebody with eczema

358
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,880
psoriasis you take a fresh ripe tomato

359
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,040
and you cut a piece off and you eat it

360
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,000
nothing's going to happen to your eczema

361
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,360
nothing's going to happen to your

362
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,639
psoriasis

363
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:02,800
but nobody eats a tomato by itself

364
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,560
and another thing too is i'll take it

365
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,760
down a little further when it comes down

366
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,839
to peppers

367
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:12,079
if you eat your pepper green it's not

368
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:14,079
ripe that's like eating a green banana

369
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:16,000
it's not ripe it's not gonna agree with

370
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:20,560
you something that's

371
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,160
so not ripe won't agree with someone

372
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,680
because it's not supposed to be

373
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,440
you're not supposed to be eating a green

374
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,519
bell pepper or green pepper

375
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,200
those are not ripe at all you're not

376
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,360
supposed to be eating a green

377
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,200
banana you're not supposed to be eating

378
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:36,000
apple off a tree

379
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:38,000
early in the season when it's hard as a

380
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,920
rock it's not even ripened

381
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
it's not going to agree with you you're

382
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:44,320
not supposed to eat a berry

383
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,360
that's red when it's supposed to be

384
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,279
black

385
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,360
or a berry that's green when it's

386
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:52,399
supposed to be blue

387
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,920
if you eat the unripe stuff

388
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,600
you're it's not going to agree with you

389
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:59,839
and here's something that happens with

390
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:01,839
tomatoes people eat them not ripe enough

391
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,680
it's not going to agree with someone

392
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:07,200
tomato sauces are made with

393
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:09,120
unripe tomatoes sometimes green tomatoes

394
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:12,079
are in tomato sauces

395
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,120
and so all these mistakes are made i'm

396
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:15,040
just going to say this

397
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,959
you guys in the medical meme community

398
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:20,880
community have heard me say this before

399
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:23,120
details matter or you're just

400
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,440
lost and then you're gonna tell someone

401
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:28,240
oh nightshades didn't work for me so

402
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:30,480
stay away from it and you're gonna then

403
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,120
compile that fear

404
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,000
and you're gonna validate the

405
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:36,399
misinformation that other health

406
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,480
practitioners put out there every single

407
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:41,199
day you're going to validate

408
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,480
their misinformation and then a whole

409
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:43,120
bunch of other people aren't going to

410
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,279
heal

411
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,480
because they're not going to know that

412
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:50,720
there's foods that you can eat that are

413
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:54,399
critical like antiviral foods

414
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:56,800
in the nightshade family so the potato

415
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,720
really important antiviral food for

416
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,079
instance critical for colitis and

417
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:03,120
crohn's and

418
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:04,320
tomato tomatoes are antiviral too but

419
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,880
you're not going to know

420
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,399
to eat an antiviral tomato anymore and

421
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:11,360
you're not going to note eat

422
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,800
an antiviral potato anymore and you're

423
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,320
just going to get lost

424
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,079
and you're going to get lost because the

425
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,480
misinformation is so rampant and the

426
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:20,560
misinformation is so off

427
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,519
so we got to keep that in mind how it

428
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,440
works

429
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,639
i love it when there's so many geniuses

430
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,279
out there

431
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:27,920
when you guys i don't know if you know

432
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,959
this

433
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:33,519
but up until outside of my

434
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:35,040
private my private work that i've done

435
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,480
all these years where people there was

436
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,320
we had a waiting list

437
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,839
over a million people around the world

438
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:43,040
trying to get to talk to me

439
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:45,680
i started in the 80s doing it

440
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:47,279
i started when i was a kid doing the

441
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,440
readings and working with people who are

442
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:52,800
sick doctors were sending patients to me

443
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:55,040
all through the 1990s just droves of

444
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,399
patients coming to me through the 1990s

445
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,480
through the 2000s

446
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,600
and because i was known as the bizarre

447
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,000
symptoms guy

448
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:04,000
that's what i was known as i was known

449
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,560
as the bizarre symptoms guy because

450
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,160
nobody

451
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,600
knew when they were sick with all their

452
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,040
fatigue and their aches and pains and

453
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,480
all the strange symptoms nobody knew

454
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,800
what caused any of it

455
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,920
so i had to teach individual doctors all

456
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,680
through these years

457
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,279
i had to teach individual doctors about

458
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,800
being low-fat

459
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:20,720
you know and it bit me on the butt a

460
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,839
little bit it bit me on the butt to give

461
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,839
out all that info

462
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:26,240
and not book it put it in the book

463
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:28,639
earlier on in the early 90s right

464
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,000
so i gave out a lot of medical medium

465
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,160
pieces

466
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,759
and those pieces really needed to find

467
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,440
their home so you can get the whole

468
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:36,880
puzzle and know all the details right

469
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:40,639
details matter to heal

470
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:42,480
when you're really sick but

471
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,240
what i've learned is until medical

472
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,160
medium information taught everybody why

473
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,920
somebody has the tingle or the numbness

474
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,279
or the burning mouth and burning pain in

475
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,320
the burning jaw the pain in the neck

476
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:52,000
that's mysterious

477
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,519
the sciatic problems when you don't have

478
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,240
a back injury

479
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,680
when all that information when all that

480
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,639
information got out there we finally

481
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,399
knew

482
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:01,839
and when the medical medium books were

483
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:04,880

wish i could do something about that

495
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:26,480
at the libraries but the thing is is

and then then well right around that

506
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,480

00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,800
health and wellness certain doctors that

510
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:54,959
had a lot of money

511
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,639
got a lot of advertising pr marketing

512
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,519
put out a book saying hey don't eat

00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:59,600
tomatoes

514
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:01,680
or put out this and that they never even

515
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,720
knew to begin with why anybody was sick

516
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,919
ever ever ever and the millions of women

517
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,679
that have struggled and suffered and

518
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:09,039
been into doctor's offices with mystery

519
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:12,240
conditions and symptoms that were just

520
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:13,919
given steroids and antibiotics

521
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,240
until medical medium came out with the

522
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:19,280
answers nobody knew anything about this

523
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:21,199
this is just fact it's a published fact

524
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:24,319
it's just fact

525
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:26,160

00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:27,760
go do corella that's what you should be

527
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,320

00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,520
you don't even know how cruella works

529
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,360
and you don't even know why anybody's

530
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,799

hey you should do you know fish oil oh

535
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,840

00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,400
don't know why anybody's sick to begin

537
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:48,960
with and

538
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,600

00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:41,520
highly intelligent people and so smart

562
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,080
health professionals and doctors and all

563
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,840
the different

564
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,200
stuff out there and everybody thinks

565
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,760
they're a genius or they're or

566
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,919
everybody's portrayed as a genius right

567
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:51,520
but any but no one knows anything in the

568
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:54,160
health movement

569
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:55,600
yeah sure you can get a hip replacement

570
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,840
but look what happened there with the

571
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:00,000
hip replacements too

572
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:02,160
they all got metal on metal and i

573
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
remember those days i remember people

574
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,440
filing into my office right they had a

575
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,160
hip replacement

576
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,120
they were sick as goats they come into

577
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,120
my office

578
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,360
and spirit of compassion would be like

579
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:15,919
this person's hip replacement is eaten

580
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,679
up they have to get to the doctor they

581
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:21,520
have to cut them open

582
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:23,840
look in there and see that the the

583
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:26,160
joint in that hip is rubbing and

584
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:28,799
grinding into metal

585
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,480
right but those are nuts and bolts

586
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:31,600
replacement parts chronic ill which

587
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,960
became chron which is

588
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,720
a mystery to people when they don't know

589
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:37,039
what's causing in the moment but

590
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:39,039
chronic illness is way more pets way

591
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:41,120
past that

592
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:42,720
but it's one thing if medical medium

593
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,520
information knows a lot about chronic

594
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,080
illness

595
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:47,600
which is the mysteries to it all and

596
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:50,720
teaching it out there but it's another

597
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:53,679
if i have to correct the little stuff

598
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:55,760

599
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:56,559

664
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:15,600
amy so i'm allergic to celery well

665
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:20,000
what happens when you have celery

666
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:20,000
right what happens when you have celery

667
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,120
did you go to your doctor because your

668
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,120
throat's closing up did you go to the

669
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:28,159
emergency room

670
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:30,320
is that why so you ate a piece of celery

671
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:34,240
your throat closed up

672
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:37,600
no right no so you went to your doctor

673
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,600
and they just threw that on the test

674
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,799
um food allergy tests the ones where

675
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:46,559
they tell you you're allergic to 10

676
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:49,600
15 20 things but yet you can eat those

677
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:52,840
things and not have a problem

678
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:54,000
uh those things i've always seen as

679
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:56,720
corrupt

680
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,080
for sure i mean listen to your doctor

681
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,919
dude he tells you he tells you to stay

682
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:03,440
off celery you stay off celery

683
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:06,880
but if it was me i i you know i

684
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:08,559
i would just am i am i choking when i

685
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,000
have a celery stick all of a sudden my

686
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:12,400
throat closes up and i can't breathe and

687
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,159
i'm having anaphylactic shock

688
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,440
if that's happening then yeah stay away

689
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:18,480
from celery

690
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,480
stay away from celery

691
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:22,159
but when it comes down to tests for food

692
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:24,400
allergies and the all-cat test and

693
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:25,840
everything else around it all i've never

694
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,679
seen things so skewed

695
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,880
i have a doctor actually calling me any

696
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:31,039
minute too

697
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,799
because he's he's gonna he's a doctor

698
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:34,880
that does all the tests and

699
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:36,799
he did he pulled some blood work and i

700
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,960
asked for all the food allergy tests so

701
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:41,840
i got a doctor coming in right now

702
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,840
calling and

703
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,240
but i still want to make this stuff here

704
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,200
so hopefully it doesn't interrupt us too

705
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,400
much

706
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,159
i think what happens is when you're

707
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,000
doing the food allergy test it's easy to

708
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:55,120
get thrown

709
00:23:52,000 --> 00:24:00,559
really easy to be thrown on that

710
00:23:55,120 --> 00:24:00,559
and i think that here he is

711
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:06,159
hey dr blott so hey how did my blood

712
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,919

782
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:08,880
here's how it works when you're allergic

783
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:12,559
to gluten whether a test shows it or not

784
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:15,279
the gluten feeds bugs nobody knew

785
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:16,799
that medical medium information is the

786
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:19,440
first to tell everybody

787
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:20,000
that the reason why anybody sensitive to

788
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:23,360
gluten on

789
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:26,880
any level is because it feeds pathogens

790
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:28,240
it feeds pathogens 35 years ago

791
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,360
i was telling everybody stay off of

792
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,960
wheat stay off the wheat stay off of

793
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,080
wheat stay off of wheat just constantly

794
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,679
stay off a wheat wheat

795
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,960
wheat stay off a week everybody looked

796
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:35,600
at me like i just came off of the

797
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,799
spaceship

798
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:41,520
i had 10 heads because it was the most

799
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:43,520
craziest bizarre thing anybody's ever

800
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,960
heard is stay off a wheat so they would

801
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,559
all go wait a minute whole wheat

802
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,080
whole wheat whole wheat is good for you

803
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:49,039
right did you guys know the health

804
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:52,240
movement

805
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:52,799
believe that whole wheat was incredible

806
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:56,240
for you

807
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:59,200
the health movement it was processed

808
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:00,559
bread people here's you guys got to keep

809
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,120
in mind

810
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:04,000
the only thing that the health movement

811
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:07,039
was worried about

812
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,919
30 years ago the only thing

813
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:11,200
with bread was that it was stripped of

814
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:14,080
nutrients

815
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:16,080
not that it did any harm it was just

816
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:18,399
void of nutrients this is really

817
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,279
important information right here that's

818
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:21,039
the only thing

819
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:22,399
the health movement thought about with

820
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:24,000
bread

821
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:25,600
they didn't they didn't know anything

822
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,440
about all these different things with

823
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:31,120
gluten or anything they just knew

824
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:34,720
that bread was processed so that that

825
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:36,559
white bread that was squishy was bad for

826
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,399
you because it was void of nutrients

827
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:40,159
that's the only thing the health

828
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:43,520
movement knew about it

829
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:46,240
and then me came along and i said it's

830
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:47,919
the wheat it's the wheat it's the wheat

831
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,440
it's the gluten it's the wheat it's the

832
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:50,480
gluten it's the wheat and they'd be like

833
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,440
no no it's not

834
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:55,039
wheat because we're doing nutrition and

835
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,919
nutritional wheat

836
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:59,679
we're doing the whole grain wheat whole

837
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:00,880
grain wheat berries whole grain wheat

838
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:04,080
fiber bread

839
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:06,240
whole grain wheat germ you guys

840
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:08,880
the health movement believed in wheat

841
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:12,799
germ lorraine elle says this is true

842
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:14,799
they ran out and the whole movement

843
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:16,640
believed in wheat germ it didn't matter

844
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:17,760
if you were plant-based didn't matter if

845
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,600
you were vegetarian

846
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:21,520
didn't matter if you were the cleanest

847
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,080
eater the animal protein eater you can

848
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,559
find

849
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,760
the entire movement believed wheat germ

850
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:27,600
was good for you

851
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:29,360
i'm the one that was screaming top the

852
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,440
top of the mountain tops

853
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,640
that the gluten and the weed is all bad

854
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,520
it's all bad

855
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:37,840
then everybody hated me for it but took

856
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:39,360
years of that work for us to get to this

857
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:42,640
point now

858
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:43,679
but here's the funny thing even with all

859
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,200
that i've done

860
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:47,039
they still don't know why gluten even

861
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,440
does anything

862
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:50,720
it feeds the bugs i've been saying this

863
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,200
and what you're going to get out of me

864
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:55,600
is consistency going all the way back

865
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:57,399
from childhood it's always going to be

866
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,520
consistency it's not going to be

867
00:29:57,399 --> 00:30:00,640
non-contradictive and everything that's

868
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:03,200
medical medium

869
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:05,360
is never proven wrong it only eventually

870
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:08,480
gets proven right

871
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:09,840
but it never gets proven wrong it's got

872
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,520
the track record

873
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:13,600
medical medium information has never

874
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:16,080
been proved wrong once you guys

875
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:17,200
never ever been proved wrong once by any

876
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:20,559
doctor by any

877
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:22,720
by any institution by any sciences

878
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:23,600
institution by anywhere it's only been

879
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,840
proven right

880
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:28,080
and a little bit at a time it's proven

881
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,080
right

882
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:32,240
gluten feeds the bugs that are inside of

883
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,679
us

884
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,159
so the bugs eat it that's the only

885
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:40,159
reason

886
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:41,039
why wheat gluten or gluten is bad for

887
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:44,720
you

888
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:46,799
or problematic because

889
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,480
narashini and throw info from above

890
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:50,000
exactly since i was a child has been

891
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:53,279
saying the same thing since i was

892
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,200
a child all of it it's consistency

893
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:56,559
not like the podcast doctors that say

894
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,640
tomatoes are bad you should see what

895
00:30:56,559 --> 00:31:01,679
they were saying five years ago

896
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,399
or two years ago or last year or three

897
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:03,679
months ago

898
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:05,279
they change but nobody holds them

899
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:06,720
accountable for it's like no one's awake

900
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:07,360
watching them or listening to them

901
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,960
because i think

902
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,399
too they're circulating all these new

903
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:12,080
people from all their ads

904
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:13,760
so it's almost like a fresh start every

905
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,720
10 seconds they screw up and they get a

906
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,919
fresh start

907
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,679
because they got a million dollars a

908
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:19,039
month going into ads did you know that

909
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:21,440
do you know that all these guys have a

910
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:23,120
million dollars a month going into ads

911
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:25,039
to sell all their garbage and everything

912
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,399
and to get new people on board to hear

913
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:27,840
about tomato being bad

914
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:29,679
they get a million dollars a month going

915
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:31,840
into ads

916
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:33,200
it's it's incredible you guys you

917
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:36,320
wouldn't even believe it

918
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:38,399
you wouldn't even believe it there's a

919
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:41,519
difference between anaphylaxis

920
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:43,919
shock hives

921
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:45,120
there's a difference between that and

922
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:47,679
what happens when

923
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:49,279
you're getting real food allergies in a

924
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:51,200
different way so there's two kinds of

925
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:54,559
food allergies the food allergy

926
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:58,559
if you get anaphylactic shock that means

927
00:31:54,559 --> 00:32:02,320
whatever that was like peanut butter

928
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:05,440
was in something when it was injected

929
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:08,559
into you from the outside of the body

930
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:10,000
okay this is why i tell people do not

931
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:13,039
get b12 shots

932
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:16,159
do not get b12 shots do not get b12

933
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:17,440
shots i say this all the time do not get

934
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:19,840
b12 shots

935
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,480
you will eventually get anaphylaxis

936
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:23,279
shock

937
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:25,360
from your b12 if you've had too many b12

938
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:27,120
shots as the years go by

939
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,799
your body will build an antibody to the

940
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,799
b12 because it's entering on the outside

941
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:32,320
of the body which is through your skin

942
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:34,240
on the outside of the body not

943
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,919
intravenously in your vein but on the

944
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:38,399
outside of your body

945
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:39,600
and eventually because of that your

946
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:40,080
immune system is just gonna be like

947
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,440
that's an

948
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,519
enemy that's an enemy because it's

949
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:45,200
coming in the wrong way it's not coming

950
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:46,960
in through the mouth orally and we're

951
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,559
going to build an antibody to it and

952
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:50,320
when that's going to then that's going

953
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:53,760
to depend on how someone's going to

954
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:53,760
react to it eventually

955
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:58,480
so that's how things work it's like a

956
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,399
bee sting

957
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:03,039
you get stung by a bee the reason why

958
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:05,200
the pain is there

959
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:08,240
reason why the pain is so bad when

960
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:12,159
you're stung by a bee is because

961
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:16,080
your body your body is like sending an

962
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:19,440
army to that spot and then it swells up

963
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:20,320
it swells up because you're not supposed

964
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,480
to enter things

965
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:25,919
and that's that's the skin at least so

966
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:28,080
there's a different alarm bells for that

967
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:30,080
but when it goes into a needle and

968
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:31,679
passes everything and goes into the

969
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:34,399
muscle past the derm and now it's a

970
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:34,399
whole nother game

971
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:39,440
yeah and so people can have people can

972
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:42,159
have

973
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:43,200
anaphylactic shock with the b stick but

974
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:44,640
bee sting

975
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,720
similar to that because it's coming from

976
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,720
the outside a lot of people their body

977
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:51,519
doesn't like that

978
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,960
so i tell people it's like with the b12

979
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:56,000
shots

980
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:58,159
really important antibiotic shots as

981
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,840
well i tell doctors all the time

982
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:01,760
do if you're gonna if you're gonna

983
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:04,559
prescribe i tell doctors all the time

984
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:06,880
if you're gonna prescribe an antibiotic

985
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:09,919
to your patients

986
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:12,639
prescribe it orally don't

987
00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:14,000
do a needle i'm not talking about

988
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:15,119
intravenous i'm talking about a needle

989
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,159
into the arm

990
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:20,960
into the butt the butt muscle

991
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:22,159
glorio the you know into the glute i'm

992
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,639
not talking about

993
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:25,919
that way right i'm not i'm talking about

994
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:28,560
that way not into the

995
00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:28,960
intravenously so what happens is when

996
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,960
because

997
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,720
antibiotics when they're driven into you

998
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,560
like that by a needle your body's gonna

999
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:36,320
they eventually build some type of

1000
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:38,079
antibody towards an antibiotic and now

1001
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,280
you're not gonna be able to handle

1002
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:41,040
you're not gonna be able to handle

1003
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,960
penicillin you're gonna be allergic to

1004
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,879
penicillin

1005
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,639
a lot of reasons why people are allergic

1006
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:47,440
to penicillin is because penicillin was

1007
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:50,879
injected

1008
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:53,760
through a needle through their arm or

1009
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:55,280
through a needle on their behind and

1010
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:58,000
that's why they become allergic to

1011
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,000
penicillin

1012
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:03,440
yeah all these things matter if you're

1013
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:06,720
allergic to shellfish that means somehow

1014
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:07,200
shellfish entered into your body the

1015
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:12,079
wrong

1016
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:14,240
way or a component or a

1017
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:17,280
compound of shellfish entered into your

1018
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:20,880
body the wrong way

1019
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:21,359
somewhere along the line there's there's

1020
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,960
there's

1021
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:24,960
there's reasons why we have that

1022
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:27,760
anaphylaxis shock or that serious

1023
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:31,119
serious hive issue or hives

1024
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:32,720
too part of it is because their liver is

1025
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:34,720
all sluggish and stagnant everybody's

1026
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:36,640
liver is sluggish and stagnant and just

1027
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,760
completely congested with all this

1028
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:40,160
garbage and junk

1029
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:42,000
just filled with tons of stuff filled

1030
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:43,680
with all kinds of things

1031
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,520
and that's where the hive part comes

1032
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:47,040
into play the hives

1033
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:49,440
the hives come into play because the

1034
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:51,760
liver is so stagnant and sluggish and so

1035
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:54,320
gunked up and when it's that gunked up

1036
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:57,359
and that's sluggish and not stagnant

1037
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:59,200
then we get in trouble we get in trouble

1038
00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:01,119
that means all you have to do is start

1039
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,400
exercising a little bit and boom that

1040
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:03,920
blood rushing through that liver is

1041
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,400
going to bring out all that gunk and now

1042
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,839
you're going to be

1043
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,839
hived up every other day

1044
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:11,200
you can get hives easily just just

1045
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:12,000
eating anything because you eat

1046
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,680
something too

1047
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,920
that's flushing the liver a little bit

1048
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:17,839
you get hives that way too

1049
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:19,760
the hives are really a difficult one

1050
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:21,200
sometimes easy to fix once you clean up

1051
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,720
your liver and you get past them for a

1052
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:26,160
while it's easy to fix

1053
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:27,680
medical medium style for sure

1054
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:29,599

doctor can

1079
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:30,880
that's a funny one to me i'm scratching

1080
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,880
my head on that

1081
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:35,520
because i had a 24-hour hotline for

1082
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,880
years

1083
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:39,200
what were you doing when i wasn't

1084
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:41,280
sleeping for all those years

1085
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:43,280
you know i mean i'm i'm sure that's like

1086
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,560
that's you know a compliment in your

1087
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:46,560
and you're being nice about it and

1088
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:48,160
that's not that's not a insult or

1089
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,680
anything but check this out right

1090
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:51,599
does this help though with that a little

1091
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:55,040
bit i had a 24

1092
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:56,800
hour hotline hardly slept a wink

1093
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:58,400
you know what my emergency hotline was

1094
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:00,079
for it was for doctors and their

1095
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,920
patients

1096
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:03,280
so i had doctors waking me up all night

1097
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:05,520
long for years

1098
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:07,040
and years with emergencies with their

1099
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:09,760
patients

1100
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,240
and that's what my life was like and my

1101
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,560
life

1102
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:14,560
isn't much better than that now it's

1103
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:15,760
just a little better where i do sleep

1104
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:18,160
more

1105
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,839
because you know i'm not i i don't sleep

1106
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,800
as much because i'm working 20 hours a

1107
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:23,920
day now

1108
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:24,720
before i was working you know 15 18

1109
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,320
hours a day

1110
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,839
and then up throughout the night with

1111
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:32,480
calls all the time

1112
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:35,040
so i had the 24-hour hotline for years

1113
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:36,320
years you know the beepers do you guys

1114
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:39,119
know little beepers

1115
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:40,560
the beavers you'd have on right the

1116
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:44,160
beavers you'd have on

1117
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:45,040
they beep yeah i had one of those by my

1118
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:47,839
bed

1119
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:49,680
right by my head right there and doctors

1120
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:52,079
all had the number

1121
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:53,599
every single night and i still get

1122
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,800
people calling me with emergencies all

1123
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:58,800
the time

1124
00:38:54,800 --> 00:39:00,000
all the time i do and i still help out

1125
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:02,240
some people i still i

1126
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,240
do still help out some people some of

1127
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:06,560
the most powerful people in the world

1128
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:07,839
because what what the only reason why i

1129
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,240
do that people say well why would you

1130
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:09,599
help

1131
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:12,480
some of the most powerful people in the

1132
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:16,000
world why would you do that

1133
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:19,520
like what would that matter it's because

1134
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:22,079
it's a way to also reach more people

1135
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:22,880
reach more people so we can heal the

1136
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:24,880
world

1137
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:26,079
it's critical that there's some

1138
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:28,880
something like that

1139
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:29,359
you know out there i don't i don't have

1140
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:31,359
pr

1141
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:33,680
and marketing i don't i'm not like the

1142
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:35,440
podcast doctors they spend 500 000 a

1143
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:37,040
month a million dollars a month

1144
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,880
so people can listen to podcasts and buy

1145
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:40,000
their products i don't have that going

1146
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:42,560
on

1147
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,079
so none of that happens here so that's

1148
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:47,119
critical to know

1149
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:48,480
and so you know my reach even though

1150
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:50,480
millions of books have gotten out there

1151
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,920
thank god because of the publisher

1152
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,520
millions of books have gotten out there

1153
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,079
in the world and have been the number

1154
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:56,640
one health

1155
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:57,680
author for six years running even with

1156
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,200
all that

1157
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,800
still i don't hire all the pr and

1158
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:03,040
marketing and all that stuff

1159
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,560
to do the reach so i do help out some of

1160
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,359
the most powerful people in the world

1161
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,280
though

1162
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:08,839
because i've been helping them out for

1163
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:12,640

00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:15,440

1168
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:24,240

let's go back to 19 to say any of 1993

1179
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:46,000
i'd say

1180
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:47,280
there's a knock on my door it's two

1181
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,200
o'clock in the morning

1182
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:51,520
and a mom is holding a baby with a fever

1183
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:53,920
of 105.

1184
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:56,319
how about that happened on a regular

1185
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,319
basis

1186
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:00,720
so how does aw handle emergencies okay

1187
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:05,359
the hotline rings

1188
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:06,720
and beeps and someone's in the hospital

1189
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:08,720
and the doctors don't know if they're

1190
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:10,480
about to do an appendicitis for

1191
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:12,480
you know if they're the appendix removal

1192
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:15,520
because of an appendicitis issue

1193
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:16,960
right or it's severe food poisoning and

1194
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,480
i have to talk to the doctor to give the

1195
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:21,280
decision to the doctors the doctor can

1196
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:23,119
make a decision for the surgeon

1197
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:25,200
how about that for emergencies and it's

1198
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:28,560
a four-year-old

1199
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:30,319
all the time this happened all the time

1200
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:32,319
i worked with doctors all the time and

1201
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:35,839
that happened so how does

1202
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:35,839
aw do it

1203
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:42,079
okay so we're looking good here

1204
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:43,760
so what i'm going to do is i think i'm

1205
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:46,800
going to go with

1206
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:49,040

1216
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,079

1223
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:24,800

don't be afraid of a tomato

1272
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:18,640
there's pandemic information in this

1273
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:21,280
book by the way

1274
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:22,720
pandemic information in this book it's

1275
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:25,280
mind-blowing

1276
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:26,640
and it's the original information it was

1277
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:28,160
taken originally it's published here

1278
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:29,200
first but was taken here and used

1279
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,960
recently

1280
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:32,560
by a couple different doctors so they

1281
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,079
took it from medical medium didn't cite

1282
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:35,839
back medical medium and they're

1283
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:37,440
using my pandemic information that was

1284
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:39,200
published first isn't that incredible

1285
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:42,400
though when you think about that

1286
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:43,680
what do you think about that you know

1287
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:45,920
discrimination

1288
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:47,040
there's a lot of doctors that do cite me

1289
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:48,319
all the time and there's doctors that

1290
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,359
use the medical mean books in their

1291
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:50,880
practices

1292
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:52,560
but when you don't cite me it's just

1293
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:53,040
it's just spiritual discrimination it's

1294
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:55,200
also

1295
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:57,119
greed because you're so hungry for new

1296
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:59,359
thought and new ideas

1297

just they're so hungry for

1301
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:08,560
new stuff so just take it from the mm

cite them it's just like who does who

1304
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:14,160

around

1362
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:23,040
in frog land you can play around in frog

1363
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:24,960
land

1364
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:26,640
there's a ton of frauds out there tons

1365
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:28,240
of them you can play in that land all

1366
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,559
day long you can do your fish oil and

1367
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:31,440
your

1368
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:31,760
charcoal and you can do your you know

1369
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,520
your

1370
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:35,280
oil pulling and waste 20 minutes every

1371
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:37,200
single day doing your oil pulling

1372
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:39,119
which encapsulates the bacteria in your

1373
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,520
teeth and gums which is disastrous you

1374
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:41,680
can

1375
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:43,440
play around in fraud land do your

1376
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:44,559
kombucha tea which turns your blood into

1377
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:46,640
acid

1378
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:48,160

1382
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:53,760
actually be cleaning up stuff not eating

1383
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:56,160
junk food anymore

1384
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:58,000

1385
00:47:56,160 --> 00:48:00,319
putting your cacao in your shakes

1386
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,680
fraud land again drug dealers want you

1387
00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:03,680
to put cacao in your shakes

1388
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:05,760
like you can play if you're not so sick

1389
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:08,559
or not sick you get sick

1390
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:09,599
you gotta learn the details matter you

1391
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:11,040
gotta learn

1392
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:12,480
you gotta learn all right that's a

1393
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:15,119
beautiful nori roll right there let me

1394
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:18,480
put it put it aside for now

1395
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:21,599
let's make another one let's do it again

1396
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:24,559
so i'm gonna put instead of lime

1397
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:26,079
as the juicing this up i'm gonna put a

1398
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:28,319
little bit of tomato

1399
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:29,359
juice on here from the fresh tomato

1400
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:32,559
check that out

1401
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:35,440
let's get some more cauliflower let's

1402
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:37,280
make another one

1403
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:38,800
don't use too much cauliflower rice you

1404
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:40,160
don't need to use that much rice because

1405
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:42,960
we're putting a lot of other stuff in

1406
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:46,000
here keep that in mind

1407
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:48,640
real sushi

1408
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:50,880
everybody thinks they they're so proud

1409
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:52,000
of themselves when they do the sushi out

1410
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:54,000
there right

1411
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:57,680
so everybody thinks they're so so proud

1412
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,680
of themselves i see it all the time

1413
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:02,480
so when you do your real sushi you got

1414
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:06,640
your

1415
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:08,240
tuna right it's your rice your tuna

1416
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:09,760
you got all of that there you got your

1417
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:12,880
wasabi

1418
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:14,400
got your pickled ginger so you got your

1419
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,800
little plate you got your sushi plate

1420
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:17,040
right

1421
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:18,319
so people are taught right now to think

1422
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:20,000
that's eating healthy

1423
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:22,160
and you'll see people out there like i

1424
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:24,720
had sushi i eat sushi three times a week

1425
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:28,000
that's really healthy

1426
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:29,680
but sushi's not healthy so what happens

1427
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,599
is with sushi

1428
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:33,280
is you get all that mercury you got that

1429
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:34,880
and you got all that vinegar and you got

1430
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:35,920
all that bad sugar and you got all the

1431
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:38,000
dioxins

1432
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:40,640
so when you put that all together this

1433
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:42,160
is not a health food this is disastrous

1434
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:43,760
but when you're not so sick you can play

1435
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:45,119
in sushi land i guess all you want until

1436
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:47,599
you get food poisoning

1437
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:50,000
eating you know your sushi one day and

1438
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:53,520
you're barfing for three days

1439
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:55,119
and you're just sick but what happens is

1440
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:56,720
the people don't realize it but here's

1441
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:58,400
another mistake it's like sushi so but

1442
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:59,680
people are taught that it must be

1443
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:02,000
healthy it's a healthy

1444
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:03,280
alternative you know and here's what's a

1445
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,440
funny thing hey i don't get

1446
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:07,839
i hear this all the time i don't get the

1447
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:10,800
traditional sushi at the sushi bar

1448
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:12,000
i get the vegan vegetarian sushi they

1449
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:14,000
don't use any fish

1450
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,040
in there they put avocado in there they

1451
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,359
put all this

1452
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:19,200
cool stuff they put watercress in there

1453
00:50:17,359 --> 00:50:21,200
it's all vinegar

1454
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:22,400
it's all vinegar just turning your blood

1455
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:25,680
into acid

1456
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:27,200
that's what it is it's all vinegar

1457
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:29,280
so i just put some rice in here

1458
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:31,280
cauliflower rice this is great

1459
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:32,640
let's cut another scallion because these

1460
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:34,319
are so fat

1461
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:36,480
these are really big scallions they're

1462
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:38,160
thick so i'm going to flip it like this

1463
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:40,000

it's fraud land it's all fraudulent

1483
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:23,520
stuff

1484
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:25,040
and there's more more i mean i'm just

1485
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:27,040
naming the few basics

fraud land again

1490
00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:37,599
but you know what keeps all the stuff

1491
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:38,880
around you know why medical medium can't

1492
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:41,040
crush this stuff

1493
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:42,079
he tries but he can't crush it third

1494
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:44,160
person

1495
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:46,160
you know why is because they're putting

1496
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:47,520
millions of dollars of ads out on all

1497
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:50,319
this stuff

1498
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:51,920
over and over and over again and as

1499
00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:54,480
people get a little sick

1500
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:57,119
not so sick not so crazy sick they're

1501
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:59,680
just jumping into it

1502
00:51:57,119 --> 00:52:00,720
fermented foods are not a health food i

1503
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:04,079
hate to break it

1504
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:05,440
to you guys it's not a health food it

1505
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:06,720
was never a health food it was a

1506
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:09,119
survival food

1507
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:10,240
and if i was if this was 2 000 years ago

1508
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:11,599
when i was in china

1509
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:13,599
you better believe i would take

1510
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:16,960
everything out of my garden

1511
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:19,760
before the before the freeze came

1512
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:20,240
and i would throw it into a big vat a

1513
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:24,079
big

1514
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:27,119
ceramic clay vat shut the lid on it

1515
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:28,640
and let it turn to mush that's what

1516
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:30,640
that's and let it ferment

1517
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:32,400
you know why they did that they had no

1518
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:33,760
refrigeration no freezers they had no

1519
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:36,960
food stuff and they had nobody

1520
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:37,599
no food stores you right when the season

1521
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:40,000
ended

1522
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:41,440
you live or die that's what it was like

1523
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,079
everywhere around the world not just

1524
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:44,800
china

1525
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:46,160
everywhere around the world that's what

1526
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:49,040
it was like

1527
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:50,720
but we always say it's ancient it's it's

1528
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:52,480
a health food no it wasn't it was like

1529
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:53,920
live or die

1530
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:55,920
so that's what they did they took all

1531
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:58,160
their fresh food by the end of the year

1532
00:52:55,920 --> 00:53:00,319
that they had left and they stuck it in

1533
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:02,160
massive vats because guess what

1534
00:53:00,319 --> 00:53:03,839
you would eat that fermented slop all

1535
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:05,440
winter long because it was the only way

1536
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:06,720
to stay alive until spring until you can

1537
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:09,520
get your new crops going

1538
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:11,119
it was a survival mechanism it wasn't a

1539
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:13,839
health food

1540
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:15,839
it was putrified and the bacteria that's

1541
00:53:13,839 --> 00:53:19,520
involved with fermented food is

1542
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:20,880
is bacteria that lives on death

1543
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:22,319
did you know that all the bacteria

1544
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:24,079
that's on fermented food isn't the kind

1545
00:53:22,319 --> 00:53:24,800
your body normally has or naturally has

1546
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:26,240
it all

1547
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:27,520
did you know the good bacteria inside

1548
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:29,040
our body has nothing to do with any of

1549
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:30,800
that fermented stuff that's not the back

1550
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:32,640
the bacteria in fermented foods bacteria

1551
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:34,400
that comes when something dies

1552
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:35,760
when an animal dies in the woods it gets

1553
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:38,960
engulfed by bacteria

1554
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:38,960
bacteria of death

1555
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:43,200
if you want to ferment a vegetable or

1556
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:44,720
anything ferment anything or ferment

1557
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:47,440
fish or ferment anything

1558
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:50,400
you what happens is it's bacteria that

1559
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:50,400
rides on death

1560
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:55,599
right so when they do hanging meats this

1561
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:57,200
is medical medium info so you know when

1562
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:59,920
they do hanging meats

1563
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:01,119
when they hang meat what is what is the

1564
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:03,440
ham they hang

1565
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:05,040
is the pork they hang right was it

1566
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:06,559
pancetta or is it something else what is

1567
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:10,240
it you guys i can't remember

1568
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:13,440
you hang you hang meat and you age it

1569
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:17,200
the bacteria on that meat got bacteria

1570
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:18,880
that's death but none of this bacteria

1571
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:21,599
that's on death of any kind

1572
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:22,880
bacteria on kimchi is death none of that

1573
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:25,280
bacteria

1574
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:27,440
is naturally inside our bodies ever so

1575
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:28,800
when you eat that fermented food you

1576
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:30,559
think that's camping out

1577
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:32,720
that bacteria doesn't camp out inside of

1578
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:35,119
you that's all bacteria that dies from

1579
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:36,000
your hcl your hcl just kills it fast

1580
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:40,960
because it's

1581
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:40,960
the wrong kind the wrong kind

1582
00:54:43,839 --> 00:54:47,440
i know you guys right i'm told every day

1583
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:48,079
why don't you make programs disappear

1584
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:50,079
for a year

1585
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:51,440
show up again make programs sell them

1586
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:52,880
for three thousand dollars a piece the

1587
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:53,760
amount of information you give for free

1588
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:55,520
is endless

1589
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:57,040
endless and no one even has information

1590
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:57,920
to give you like that so

1591
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:59,440
and they're just stealing your

1592
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:00,079
information and charging everybody for

1593
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:01,680
it anyway

1594
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:02,880

and charging for it

1597
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:06,880
everybody's stealing medical medium

1598
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:08,240
information and charging for it why

1599
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:10,640

wait for it and they'll want to do it

1604
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,720

00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:40,160
derek says derek amber says my

1611

he cite me

1616
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:57,359
so he didn't say medical medium that's

1617
00:55:54,799 --> 00:55:59,359
medical medium published information

1618
00:55:57,359 --> 00:56:03,520
my autoimmune doctor told me to get rid

1619
00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:08,720
of eggs because i have ebv do you agree

1620
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:10,799
well look i agree with your doctor's

1621
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:12,079
advice your that's your doctor giving

1622
00:56:10,799 --> 00:56:14,400
you advice

1623
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:15,920
so i i can't give you advice like that

1624
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:18,000
because your doctors he's giving he's

1625
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:22,000
your doctor he's giving you advice

1626
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:24,559
right and but i can tell you

1627
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:26,079
that that advice he's giving is medical

1628
00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:28,160
medium information

1629
00:56:26,079 --> 00:56:29,200
that's what that is it's medical medium

1630
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:32,640
information

1631
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:35,200
and pretty cool but uncool

1632
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:36,720
uncool ask him where he got it he might

1633
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:37,680
not have gotten it for a medical meeting

1634
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:39,599
he might have gotten it from another

1635
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:43,200
doctor that got it for medical mediums

1636
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:46,000
i'm gonna roll this up but first of all

1637
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:48,079
epstein-barr feeds off of eggs there's

1638
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,920
no scientific study that shows that

1639
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:52,319
so your doctor's not using science on

1640
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:54,720
any level so your doctor is not using a

1641
00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:56,240
scientific study he's not using a study

1642
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:58,319
from the mayo clinic or

1643
00:56:56,240 --> 00:57:00,319
study from john hopkins he's not using a

1644
00:56:58,319 --> 00:57:02,319
study stolen kettering he's not using a

1645
00:57:00,319 --> 00:57:03,920
study from anywhere

1646
00:57:02,319 --> 00:57:05,359
he's not the cleveland clinic there's no

1647
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,559
study there's no study anywhere he's

1648
00:57:05,359 --> 00:57:08,319
using medical media published

1649
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:08,880
information it's only place that comes

1650
00:57:08,319 --> 00:57:10,720
from this

1651
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:12,400
and there's no scientific study for it

1652
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:14,960
at all eggs

1653
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:16,880
feed viruses viruses such as

1654
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:17,680
epstein-barr the epstein-barr feeds off

1655
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:21,280
of eggs

1656
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:24,559
that is mm-info

1657
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:24,559
i'm honored you're here by the way

1658
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:29,680
epstein-barr being a problem with any

1659
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:31,839
kind of autoimmune is medical medium

1660
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:35,040
information not just the egg part

1661
00:57:31,839 --> 00:57:35,760
so what i suggest is you show the doctor

1662
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:37,760
this book

1663
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:39,119
bring the doctor this book and tell them

1664
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:41,680
where it all stems from

1665
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:42,400
published here first medical medium new

1666
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:44,720
edition

1667
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:46,079
revised expanded it was published in the

1668
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:47,760
original medical medium book

1669
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:49,599
so i would advise you bring the book to

1670
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:51,200
your doctor and you tell them a medium

1671
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:54,240
came out that information and it's not a

1672
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:56,000
scientific study

1673
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:58,799
that's what i would do the other thing

1674
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:02,880
too the other the other thing too

1675
00:57:58,799 --> 00:58:04,480
okay is that autoimmune in general

1676
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:06,240
and problems with autoimmune caused by

1677
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:08,400
epstein-barr is medical medium-published

1678
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:10,559
information as well

1679
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:12,559
there's layers of just mm info all in

1680
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:14,240
that wrapped up in there

1681
00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:15,680
so we got two nice no re rolls let's

1682
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:22,559
make a sauce

1683
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:25,599
let's do that

1684
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:27,200
you think i would be happy about it but

1685
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:28,799
how's someone get going to get the

1686
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:31,280
complete story and all the details that

1687
00:58:28,799 --> 00:58:33,680
matter so they can heal their ebv

1688
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:35,119
when they're only they're only throwing

1689
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:35,760
out tidbits that come from medical

1690
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:37,440
medium

1691
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:39,200
the sighting's critical so you can get

1692
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:41,040
the full story so you can heal

1693
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:42,720
but i guess that doesn't matter if a mom

1694
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:44,799
out there is sick with epstein-barr

1695
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:47,359
doesn't get the full story she's just

1696
00:58:44,799 --> 00:58:48,880
debilitatingly sick she's disabled she's

1697
00:58:47,359 --> 00:58:50,720
in bed now she can't feed her kids

1698
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:51,920
anymore she loses her job her husband's

1699
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:54,559
doing everything

1700
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:56,240
he's freaking out he's he's just you

1701
00:58:54,559 --> 00:58:57,760
know can't handle it anymore

1702
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:59,520
the family's falling apart the little

1703
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:00,319
kids are being wounded forever because

1704
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:03,359
of it

1705
00:59:00,319 --> 00:59:04,640
and the doctor doesn't want to give that

1706
00:59:03,359 --> 00:59:06,880
mom

1707
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:08,319
where all the information comes from so

1708
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:09,520
she can actually heal her epstein-barr

1709
00:59:08,319 --> 00:59:10,799
get her life together instead they'll

1710
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:13,359
give her fragments and then

1711
00:59:10,799 --> 00:59:14,319
offer fish oil and some corella and some

1712
00:59:13,359 --> 00:59:16,480
other things too

1713
00:59:14,319 --> 00:59:18,319
which aren't medical medium and she'll

1714
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:19,839
stay sick and the kids will be miserable

1715
00:59:18,319 --> 00:59:21,119
the family would be miserable and that's

1716
00:59:19,839 --> 00:59:22,640

all right from honey if you're if you're

01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:57,440
into the whole thing where honey's bad

1751
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:58,799
if you're a vegan or plant-based or you

1752
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:00,640
can't eat consume

1753
01:00:58,799 --> 01:01:02,079
honey you know what's really crazy is

1754
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:02,880
you get the vegans and plant-based

1755
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:04,720
people who are

1756
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:06,319
really die-hard vegan right and i

1757
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:06,960
totally respect that totally but what

1758
01:01:06,319 --> 01:01:08,480
happens is

1759
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:10,160
they get their teeth starts falling

1760
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:12,640
apart because they don't know

1761
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:14,000
other things they need and something

1762
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:15,760
goes wrong or they get their first

1763
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,200
symptoms or they get symptoms again

1764
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:18,799
after being vegan for a while and they

1765
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:20,319
freak out and here they were the person

1766
01:01:18,799 --> 01:01:21,680
saying i can't have honey

1767
01:01:20,319 --> 01:01:23,440
because it's from a bee and now they're

1768
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:25,040
eating eggs again because they because

1769
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:27,200
they've they freaked out and now they're

1770
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:27,680
eating eggs and dairy and raw dairy and

1771
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:29,200
eggs

1772
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:30,559
happens all the time meanwhile for the

1773
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:32,319
first two years of being a vegan they

1774
01:01:30,559 --> 01:01:32,960
were ripping everybody apart for eating

1775
01:01:32,319 --> 01:01:34,400
honey

1776
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:35,680
if you're a vegan eating honey if you're

1777
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:37,200
a vegan the next thing you know now

1778
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:39,839
they're eating eggs because they got

1779
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:39,839
sick

1780
01:01:42,799 --> 01:01:47,200
here's the thing about if you're

1781
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:48,640
plant-based

1782
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:50,000
why i think it's okay for you to eat

1783
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:52,000
honey and you don't have to you can

1784
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:56,160
totally just do maple syrup i like maple

1785
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:56,160
syrup too but honey

1786
01:01:56,480 --> 01:02:00,000
honey is it first of all a bee is not an

1787
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:02,960
animal

1788
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:04,319
critical to know a bee is not an animal

1789
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:07,839
it's one thing that's very important so

1790
01:02:04,319 --> 01:02:07,839
i'm making a sauce

1791
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:15,920
a bee is an insect and a bee doesn't

1792
01:02:13,359 --> 01:02:18,640
have a soul

1793
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:20,799
the all bees on the planet at once have

1794
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:22,799
a collective soul i know that's

1795
01:02:20,799 --> 01:02:24,000
that for some people i get it you know

1796
01:02:22,799 --> 01:02:25,119
some people that might be a little too

1797
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,119
much for them and they're like oh how

1798
01:02:25,119 --> 01:02:30,319
can that be how's that possible like

1799
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:31,200
you know but that's what it is it's all

1800
01:02:30,319 --> 01:02:35,039
bees have

1801
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:39,119
one soul lot of insects have

1802
01:02:35,039 --> 01:02:42,400
one soul there's not an individual

1803
01:02:39,119 --> 01:02:46,160
soul per ant there's

1804
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:50,000
the soul of all ant

1805
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:50,960
all ants kind instead of humankind all

1806
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:54,799
ant kind

1807
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:58,480
there's a soul for all the ants

1808
01:02:54,799 --> 01:03:00,559
you can stomp out all like lots of ants

1809
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:02,880
can stomp them out they're still gonna

1810
01:03:00,559 --> 01:03:06,000
have that one soul right

1811
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:08,640
it's different but a deer

1812
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:09,680
has an individual soul i know this might

1813
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:10,640
be a little too much for a lot of you

1814
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:12,559
guys i get it

1815
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:14,079

1821
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:24,799
i know that

1822
01:03:20,559 --> 01:03:27,200
um okay so i got that in there

1823
01:03:24,799 --> 01:03:28,720
let's put a little honey too making a

1824
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:30,799
nice sauce here now i'm gonna make this

1825
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:32,799
one hot

1826
01:03:30,799 --> 01:03:36,720
let's throw a pepper in here let's do

1827
01:03:32,799 --> 01:03:36,720
that this is a sweet hot pepper

1828
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:44,079
i'm not even going to dice it up

1829
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:45,920
it's going to do its thing just being in

1830
01:03:44,079 --> 01:03:47,280
like little circles in here

1831
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:48,720
on tick tock you can see that right

1832
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:51,440
let's see if you can see this down low

1833
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:54,240
on youtube you see that there you go

i think you can see it so let's put a

1835
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:59,200
little garlic in here too

1836
01:03:55,680 --> 01:04:02,079

i love garlic and i i do use a lot of it

1838
01:04:02,079 --> 01:04:04,720

honey it's a simple one

1876
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:31,920
it's a basic one so let's cut up these

1877
01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:31,920
two nori rolls

1878
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:36,799
now you guys have probably seen me do

1879
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:38,640
before sometimes i'll cut i'll have like

1880
01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:40,319
six of these in a row and i'll i'll cut

1881
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:43,920
them on the board six in a row

1882
01:05:40,319 --> 01:05:45,599
so i'm going to do just two now i'm not

1883
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:48,640
cutting real large pieces

1884
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:48,640
i'm cutting kind of

1885
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:52,799
i'd say three quarters of an inch

1886
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:56,799
is what i'm doing maybe yeah maybe three

1887
01:05:55,839 --> 01:05:58,799
quarters of an inch

1888
01:05:56,799 --> 01:06:00,480
somewhere around there right so i'm

1889
01:05:58,799 --> 01:06:04,079
doing just doing that one's gonna cut it

1890
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:06,559
close over here so let me just do this

1891
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:07,920
i think i butchered one okay let me get

1892
01:06:06,559 --> 01:06:11,119
a little plate out

1893
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:11,119
if you guys are cool with that

1894
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:15,920
let's plate these up

1895
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:19,760
now what happens if you don't cut good

1896
01:06:17,839 --> 01:06:21,280
enough of course the uh

1897
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:22,880
nori is going to be connected it's going

1898
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:25,520
to be a hassle right

1899
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:26,400
so i'm going to put these ends in the

1900
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:29,200
middle

1901
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:29,200
that's what i'm going to do

1902
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:34,960
doing a sloppy job

1903
01:06:36,319 --> 01:06:39,680
did that one even make it there putting

1904
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:41,920
the ends in the middle let me put these

1905
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:44,720
all around the edge here

1906
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:44,720
i'll show you guys

1907
01:06:45,039 --> 01:06:48,880

one fell apart i was

1912
01:06:58,839 --> 01:07:03,520
overzealous

1913
01:07:01,599 --> 01:07:05,119
that was overzealous when i was cutting

1914
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:06,640
them i was trying to be a little bit of

1915
01:07:05,119 --> 01:07:09,680
a hot shot right there right

1916
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:09,680
cutting them too fast

1917
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:14,799
being sloppy there they go right there

1918
01:07:13,839 --> 01:07:16,880

01:07:20,319 --> 01:07:24,240
dipping sauce i don't know

1924
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:27,280

1941
01:08:12,559 --> 01:08:16,400
what's in here i'm just letting you guys

1942
01:08:13,839 --> 01:08:18,400
know if you think about what's in here

1943
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:20,799
okay you got anti-viral foods there's a

1944
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:23,199
sulfur compound in cauliflower

1945
01:08:20,799 --> 01:08:24,080
that helps to stomp out viruses in your

1946
01:08:23,199 --> 01:08:26,000
thyroid

1947
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:28,640
it's the opposite if you want to talk

1948
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:30,640
about one more silly thing real quick

1949
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:32,560
what about the goitrogen stuff right

1950
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:33,759
stay away from the kale and stay away

1951
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:35,279
from the cauliflower if you have a

1952
01:08:33,759 --> 01:08:36,640
thyroid issue stay away from broccoli

1953
01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:38,000
that's misinformation terrible

1954
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:40,159
misinformation another reason why

1955
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:42,159
people don't heal your thyroid

1956
01:08:40,159 --> 01:08:45,679
desperately needs

1957
01:08:42,159 --> 01:08:47,839
the cris cruciferous

1958
01:08:45,679 --> 01:08:50,080
family it needs that it needs

1959
01:08:47,839 --> 01:08:50,640
cruciferous it's critical that you have

1960
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:54,319
that

1961
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:56,000
that's a sulfur compound that you need

1962
01:08:54,319 --> 01:08:57,920
it's so important so that's what

1963
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:01,640
saturates into the thyroid

1964
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:05,279
nodules tumors cysts thyroid cancer

1965
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:08,400
hypothyroidism hyperthyroidism graves

1966
01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:10,239
hashimoto's thyroiditis all of those is

1967
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:13,839
because of epstein-barr viruses

1968
01:09:10,239 --> 01:09:15,199
inside the thyroid and in order to help

1969
01:09:13,839 --> 01:09:17,120
you need some broccoli you need some

1970
01:09:15,199 --> 01:09:18,880
cauliflower you need these things it's

1971
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:20,880
really important

1972
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:22,400
important enough and then you got the

1973
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:25,359
dolls in there which is

1974
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:26,719
so highly mineralized so highly

1975
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:28,880
mineralized

1976
01:09:26,719 --> 01:09:30,560
and it helps to take out toxic heavy

1977
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:32,319
metals out of the intestinal tract which

1978
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:34,560
is cool you got your cilantro

1979
01:09:32,319 --> 01:09:36,319
which is a leafy green alkalizing but

1980
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:36,960
more than that trace mineral salts in

1981
01:09:36,319 --> 01:09:38,719
that too

1982
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:40,159
plus chemical compounds to help with

1983
01:09:38,719 --> 01:09:41,520
your immune system and build your immune

1984
01:09:40,159 --> 01:09:46,839
system

1985
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:49,839
yeah and all of this

1986
01:09:46,839 --> 01:09:49,839
