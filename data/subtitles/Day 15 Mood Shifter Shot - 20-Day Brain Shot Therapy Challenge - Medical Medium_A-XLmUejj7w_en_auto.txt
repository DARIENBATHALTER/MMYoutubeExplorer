[119.10 - 121.80] with moods they're struggling with
[120.72 - 123.44] sadness
[121.80 - 126.78] I think
[123.44 - 129.36] there is a difference
[126.78 - 132.12] from what I've learned from SOC with
[129.36 - 134.58] sadness that's mysterious and then just
[132.12 - 137.22] of course depression and then you may
[134.58 - 139.32] have both that's the thing you could be
[137.22 - 142.80] suffering from depression
[139.32 - 144.78] but also have this mysterious sadness
[142.80 - 146.42] involved it could be two things like
[144.78 - 149.76] mood
[146.42 - 151.80] moods uh problems happening with
[149.76 - 153.54] depression I mean I've seen it all out

[163.44 - 169.50] I'm not saying that lightly I'm not I
[167.04 - 172.86] treasure the power the mood shifter has
[169.50 - 175.92] because it does hold something I haven't
[172.86 - 177.54] seen anything else do friend of mine's
[175.92 - 180.60] son
[177.54 - 184.04] was in a really bad mood
[180.60 - 186.84] um came back from school okay and
[184.04 - 190.20] instantly she gave him the mood shifter
[186.84 - 193.20] and usually anything else she tries just
[190.20 - 194.94] doesn't change his mood and then she
[193.20 - 197.70] gave him the mood shifter and it was
[194.94 - 200.52] like a miracle happened so they're doing
[197.70 - 202.86] the mood shifter every single day
[200.52 - 204.60] when he comes home from school it's
[202.86 - 207.48] incredible really
[204.60 - 211.08] right so let's talk about mood let's get
[207.48 - 211.08] into it now so
[211.32 - 218.04] I am in the book
[213.90 - 221.16] brain saver and I am just so we know
[218.04 - 223.98] on page 207 I don't think that's the
[221.16 - 227.12] spot I'm supposed to be in hang on there
[223.98 - 227.12] let's see where we are
[227.58 - 235.02] hold on here
[230.88 - 235.02] looking for page 370.
[238.08 - 245.16] all right we got it mood changes page
[240.66 - 247.86] 370 in brain saver the book is so huge
[245.16 - 250.50] it's such a big book I don't think I'll
[247.86 - 252.06] ever know where everything is I just
[250.50 - 254.34] don't think I will
[252.06 - 257.64] all right
[254.34 - 259.26] we often hear mood changes being blamed
[257.64 - 260.76] on hormone imbalances okay that's a
[259.26 - 264.30] question I have for you guys it's really
[260.76 - 266.94] important is your mood blamed on
[264.30 - 268.62] hormones did that happen to you
[266.94 - 272.40] did you go to your practitioner your
[268.62 - 274.20] doctor your healer your herbalist your
[272.40 - 278.46] health care provider and they were like
[274.20 - 280.44] well no your sadness your mood changes
[278.46 - 282.06] is your hormones
[280.44 - 283.26] do you hear that all all the time out
[282.06 - 285.96] there
[283.26 - 288.36] because that's what people are told when
[285.96 - 290.16] it comes down to moods it's not about
[288.36 - 292.02] the toxic heavy metals in their brain
[290.16 - 294.18] it's not about because of course they
[292.02 - 296.22] don't know about that out there it's not
[294.18 - 299.22] about the toxic Metals in the brain or
[296.22 - 301.92] all the toxic chemicals or all the viral
[299.22 - 304.80] infections people have it's not about
[301.92 - 306.60] all that it's about hormones right I
[304.80 - 308.52] mean pretty much everybody says no it's
[306.60 - 311.84] hormones are the problem that's why I
[308.52 - 311.84] have a mood problem right
[312.06 - 316.44] that's what men always say I just saw
[313.80 - 319.50] that on IG that it's about women's moods
[316.44 - 321.36] because of uh hormones we often hear
[319.50 - 324.30] mood changes being blamed on hormone
[321.36 - 326.76] imbalances yes we do often hear that
[324.30 - 329.70] what's incredible is that there's a new
[326.76 - 332.70] generation and a new generation of women
[329.70 - 333.78] that are being educated that it's their
[332.70 - 337.14] hormones
[333.78 - 339.60] so if anything's wrong with their health
[337.14 - 341.88] and they're not so sick like they're not
[339.60 - 345.42] I mean they're not so sick they're not
[341.88 - 348.72] super sick they're not chronically sick
[345.42 - 352.38] if they're not chronically sick then
[348.72 - 354.72] their hormones may not be the blame if
[352.38 - 356.76] they're just partially sick they got
[354.72 - 358.68] like a little gut stuff and a little
[356.76 - 360.96] headache once in a while and they got a
[358.68 - 362.88] little bit of malaise they got a little
[360.96 - 364.68] bit of acne and they go to their
[362.88 - 366.90] functional medicine doctor or whatever
[364.68 - 368.94] doctor and the first thing that's going
[366.90 - 370.20] to happen is it's their hormones you're
[368.94 - 373.20] going to be told it's the hormone so
[370.20 - 376.50] there's a new generation of young women
[373.20 - 379.14] right now being trained to think that
[376.50 - 381.48] every single thing is for hormones and
[379.14 - 382.56] you see it now with influencers on
[381.48 - 384.78] social
[382.56 - 387.60] you'll see like 20 year olds and 21 year
[384.78 - 388.86] olds and 23 year olds and and 19 year
[387.60 - 390.60] olds and they're just and they're doing
[388.86 - 392.58] their thing about like oh it's my
[390.60 - 394.68] hormones my hormones is why I don't feel
[392.58 - 397.20] that great my hormones is why I can't
[394.68 - 399.96] sleep good at night my hormones is why I
[397.20 - 403.14] have this acne my hormones is why I'm
[399.96 - 406.08] dizzy all the time this hormones is why
[403.14 - 407.94] I don't have the energy so it's it's
[406.08 - 409.44] right now there's a new training
[407.94 - 411.66] happening since there's a new
[409.44 - 414.78] conditioning in brainwashing meanwhile
[411.66 - 417.06] where young women don't understand is
[414.78 - 418.80] that whoa no you got mercury in your
[417.06 - 420.24] brain you got aluminum you've got copper
[418.80 - 422.28] in your brain your liver is getting
[420.24 - 423.90] clogged up early on when it's not
[422.28 - 426.54] supposed to you're having all these
[423.90 - 428.94] other issues you know so it's it's all
[426.54 - 431.28] of that going on but what's happening is
[428.94 - 433.32] they're being blamed on hormones is the
[431.28 - 435.90] big one right now like every functional
[433.32 - 438.44] doctor every single practitioner it's
[435.90 - 441.90] still it's your hormones and a whole new
[438.44 - 444.18] generation of women are being completely
[441.90 - 446.10] conditioned that it's their hormones so
[444.18 - 447.78] that they're to blame they're the reason
[446.10 - 449.76] why they're sick I think it's a
[447.78 - 453.08] dangerous place to go yes hormones play
[449.76 - 455.94] a role in a lot and I'm not
[453.08 - 457.86] anti-hormone belief because I actually
[455.94 - 459.96] know from a spirit of compassion that
[457.86 - 462.72] hormones can get out of whack and they
[459.96 - 465.84] can't get out of balance absolutely but
[462.72 - 468.30] there's a difference between that
[465.84 - 470.70] and everything being hormones and
[468.30 - 472.50] hormones only and that's important to
[470.70 - 474.42] know because there's this younger
[472.50 - 477.30] generation of women that are being
[474.42 - 479.88] trained literally trained every day
[477.30 - 481.92] right now that their their hormones are
[479.88 - 484.26] every reason why they're depressed they
[481.92 - 486.30] have anxiety so if they have anxiety or
[484.26 - 487.68] anxiousness or panic attacks it's their
[486.30 - 490.92] hormone
[487.68 - 492.84] um if their periods are difficult it's
[490.92 - 494.76] their hormones if they have acne it's
[492.84 - 497.40] their hormones if they have any kind of
[494.76 - 499.68] mood shifting against their hormones and
[497.40 - 502.08] hormones aren't why people are severely
[499.68 - 503.76] depressed that have anxiety hormones
[502.08 - 505.68] aren't why people are suffering from
[503.76 - 509.28] these bad bad periods when they're
[505.68 - 511.32] younger hormones aren't the reason why a
[509.28 - 513.42] lot of things right but but there's
[511.32 - 515.88] you'll see it now on social it's it's
[513.42 - 518.22] almost like oh my God are you kidding so
[515.88 - 521.34] they have completely brainwashed and
[518.22 - 524.22] they're gonna brainwash the entire you
[521.34 - 526.08] know world of young women that their
[524.22 - 528.00] hormones are to blame for everything and
[526.08 - 530.16] that's the new Direction alternative
[528.00 - 531.72] medicine and conventional medicine but
[530.16 - 533.04] the New Direction alternative medicine
[531.72 - 534.78] has gone
[533.04 - 538.98] and I support
[534.78 - 541.68] I support hormones and hormone even to
[538.98 - 544.38] some degree bioidentical I talk about
[541.68 - 547.68] an idea for women but hormones are not
[544.38 - 549.90] why young women have difficult periods
[547.68 - 552.30] There's real reasons happening there's
[549.90 - 554.64] low grade viral infections there's toxic
[552.30 - 558.18] heavy metals it's just a couple but the
[554.64 - 560.58] point is and also adrenal problems which
[558.18 - 561.90] is adrenal hormones that's an entirely
[560.58 - 565.56] different thing but they'll blame
[561.90 - 568.20] everything on hormones for young women
[565.56 - 570.66] and that's what's going on right now
[568.20 - 573.54] that's the new normal that's developing
[570.66 - 576.72] so and you'll see it five years
[573.54 - 579.06] there'll be another billion sick women
[576.72 - 580.68] in five years they'll all be on social
[579.06 - 581.94] like young women will be on social and
[580.68 - 584.40] they'll all be like it's my hormones
[581.94 - 587.10] it's why I'm numb in my arms and I feel
[584.40 - 589.44] like I got sandbags in my legs
[587.10 - 591.36] and and they won't talk about caffeine
[589.44 - 593.10] blowing out their adrenals or caffeine
[591.36 - 594.72] like damaging their brain or anything
[593.10 - 597.12] because caffeine they want young women
[594.72 - 599.40] on caffeine the in the caffeine industry
[597.12 - 600.90] wants young women on caffeine and then
[599.40 - 603.06] the medical industry would love for
[600.90 - 604.68] women to just believe it's their genes
[603.06 - 607.86] or their hormones
[604.68 - 610.08] and if they're really sick really really
[607.86 - 611.70] sick then the medical industry will say
[610.08 - 613.62] well it's your body attacking itself
[611.70 - 616.02] it's autoimmune so what you're going to
[613.62 - 618.30] see is on social you're going to see
[616.02 - 620.94] millions and millions and millions of of
[618.30 - 623.52] influencer influencers women influencers
[620.94 - 626.94] like young ones right young women like
[623.52 - 628.44] 21 22 23 in a few years you're going to
[626.94 - 631.20] see millions of them and they're all
[628.44 - 632.88] going to be like well it's if they're
[631.20 - 634.74] too sick it'll be like well my body's
[632.88 - 636.42] attacking itself it's autoimmune right
[634.74 - 637.62] which we know isn't the truth if you
[636.42 - 639.48] know if you know medical meme
[637.62 - 641.22] information the body doesn't attack
[639.48 - 644.52] itself or the other thing is they're
[641.22 - 646.80] going to be like it's my hormones
[644.52 - 649.14] that's the conditioning of what's
[646.80 - 651.66] happening today it's to put blame it's
[649.14 - 653.76] body shame so what I'm trying to say is
[651.66 - 655.92] that the industries
[653.76 - 659.40] are teaching
[655.92 - 662.52] women to shame their bodies
[659.40 - 664.56] so it's all about body shaming now it's
[662.52 - 668.22] your hormones that's a form of body
[664.56 - 670.86] shaming yes when you're 40 years old you
[668.22 - 672.96] can have hormone imbalances yes you you
[670.86 - 674.94] could find an incredible doctor that
[672.96 - 676.62] does bioidentical hormones if you're 45
[674.94 - 678.12] years old if that's the direction you
[676.62 - 680.10] want to go if they're really
[678.12 - 682.56] knowledgeable or something but that's
[680.10 - 683.82] that's not what this is I'm not talking
[682.56 - 685.56] about this
[683.82 - 687.84] I'm talking about
[685.56 - 691.26] young women that are sick for other
[687.84 - 693.96] reasons being body shamed and the body
[691.26 - 696.06] shaming is out of control right now and
[693.96 - 698.16] it's just beginning
[696.06 - 704.34] and the body shaming is going to be like
[698.16 - 707.16] every single 18 19 17 15 whatever 21 22
[704.34 - 708.72] 25 year old woman like every one of them
[707.16 - 711.66] is going to be if they have a symptom
[708.72 - 713.64] like a neurological symptom or anxiety
[711.66 - 716.76] or depression or depersonalization or
[713.64 - 719.52] OCD it's your hormones
[716.76 - 722.76] it's your fault your body's bad
[719.52 - 724.32] your body's faulty your body is not
[722.76 - 727.08] working right
[724.32 - 728.58] or it's your jeans or it's your body
[727.08 - 730.32] attacking itself and that's where it's
[728.58 - 733.92] going
[730.32 - 736.44] okay boots Berlin says pregnancy is not
[733.92 - 738.96] sickness it is he a huge change in the
[736.44 - 742.44] whole Temple hormones roller coaster
[738.96 - 745.20] pregnancy is hard on the body and when
[742.44 - 747.90] women have problems like autoimmune
[745.20 - 750.00] which is like viruses and low-grade
[747.90 - 754.68] viral infections when women are very
[750.00 - 756.18] sick pregnancy is very difficult on a
[754.68 - 758.16] woman who's very sick with chronic
[756.18 - 761.10] illness okay because there's all these
[758.16 - 763.44] other problems why do you see one woman
[761.10 - 765.78] have a good pregnancy where it was
[763.44 - 767.52] easier and another woman have a very
[765.78 - 769.26] difficult pregnancy it was harder
[767.52 - 771.72] because of other problems going on
[769.26 - 774.12] pathogens Epstein-Barr infections in the
[771.72 - 776.88] reproductive system because the immune
[774.12 - 779.58] system is protecting the baby and the
[776.88 - 780.84] reproductive system so if a woman is
[779.58 - 784.38] sick during her pregnancy she's
[780.84 - 788.40] chronically ill there's other problems
[784.38 - 791.58] at hand here so that's how it works yes
[788.40 - 794.58] there's there's hormones related to
[791.58 - 797.46] pregnancy absolutely and all of that but
[794.58 - 799.14] I'm trying to show you like something's
[797.46 - 800.82] really important though so I know you
[799.14 - 802.74] just want to pass everything off of a
[800.82 - 804.24] pregnant the woman's pregnant her
[802.74 - 806.70] hormones are all over the place it's
[804.24 - 808.26] like let's not kind of insult everybody
[806.70 - 810.54] because what people don't even realize
[808.26 - 812.88] is your immune system
[810.54 - 814.38] is and I'm not saying you're insulting
[812.88 - 815.70] anybody I'm just saying that's that's
[814.38 - 818.10] something that happens out there people
[815.70 - 821.70] are saying that out there they're saying
[818.10 - 823.62] oh well oh she's pregnant that's what's
[821.70 - 825.30] going on that's why she's having such a
[823.62 - 826.20] hard time it's like whoa he's having a
[825.30 - 827.82] hard time
[826.20 - 828.96] because there's so many other problems
[827.82 - 830.64] going on
[828.96 - 832.86] she's struggling from so many other
[830.64 - 835.08] different situations
[832.86 - 837.54] maybe her adrenals aren't strong and one
[835.08 - 839.04] of them is weakened right that's just
[837.54 - 841.50] one thing maybe she got the low-grade
[839.04 - 843.54] viral infections yeah
[841.50 - 845.52] maybe she's got the toxic heavy metals
[843.54 - 848.28] maybe there's other things going on and
[845.52 - 850.32] all of that combined and then being
[848.28 - 851.40] pregnant and having a baby right but
[850.32 - 854.64] they'll just blame everything on
[851.40 - 856.08] hormones so you'll have a mom that's
[854.64 - 858.72] pregnant
[856.08 - 860.88] and she's struggling with her pregnancy
[858.72 - 863.70] and her health and they'll just blame it
[860.88 - 866.16] all on hormones when wait a minute no
[863.70 - 870.48] that Mom has a lot of other problems
[866.16 - 873.96] going on making it really difficult
[870.48 - 875.76] but that's one topic right there they're
[873.96 - 878.58] training
[875.76 - 880.50] millions of young women to believe that
[878.58 - 882.54] everything is hormones
[880.50 - 885.06] so if they have one problem it's
[882.54 - 887.72] hormones whatever that is one symptom
[885.06 - 887.72] see
[887.88 - 893.70] um Dreyer woolman says my pregnancies
[890.88 - 896.70] were the worst especially my second one
[893.70 - 898.92] I was deep into standard naturopathic
[896.70 - 901.56] treatments eating way too much protein
[898.92 - 904.68] and my viruses were out of control
[901.56 - 906.12] I hadn't found you yet aw my God you
[904.68 - 907.26] know the information then you're reading
[906.12 - 908.82] the information and you're learning
[907.26 - 913.20] that's incredible
[908.82 - 916.44] it really truly Dr Laura woolman
[913.20 - 919.26] thank you Dr Laura
[916.44 - 921.84] thank you for being here so proud of you
[919.26 - 923.28] so anyway I think that since we're
[921.84 - 925.02] talking about mood changes I just wanted
[923.28 - 926.94] to talk about hormone imbalances a
[925.02 - 929.28] little bit too
[926.94 - 931.50] and I think that
[929.28 - 933.12] for to begin with
[931.50 - 935.94] like Spirit of passion always told me
[933.12 - 938.94] yes you could have hormones that are
[935.94 - 941.40] um imbalanced I never said you can't
[938.94 - 943.98] have imbalanced hormones
[941.40 - 945.66] you can and the adrenals produce a lot
[943.98 - 947.60] of reproductive hormones too and they
[945.66 - 950.82] produce a lot of hormones
[947.60 - 953.16] but what happens is though there's
[950.82 - 955.56] hundreds of other symptoms
[953.16 - 959.58] and these hundreds of other symptoms
[955.56 - 961.32] don't play any role with hormones
[959.58 - 963.48] and that's important to know so that
[961.32 - 964.92] means hormones aren't causing those
[963.48 - 967.62] symptoms
[964.92 - 968.82] I just want that out there
[967.62 - 972.48] clear
[968.82 - 975.72] because it's so important right now it's
[972.48 - 977.34] just if you're 20 years old
[975.72 - 978.72] and you're a woman
[977.34 - 980.76] and you go to a couple different
[978.72 - 983.16] practitioners and doctors and you have a
[980.76 - 984.30] symptom oh you better believe you're
[983.16 - 986.94] going to be told it's your hormones
[984.30 - 989.82] people with same hormones out of whack
[986.94 - 991.38] don't have those symptoms so one 20 year
[989.82 - 993.36] old
[991.38 - 994.86] and another one can have two different
[993.36 - 996.30] experiences
[994.86 - 998.28] right
[996.30 - 1000.38] so it's incredible how it works because
[998.28 - 1002.42] hormones are not the cause of every
[1000.38 - 1004.76] single symptom and condition but they're
[1002.42 - 1006.56] going there soon and they're already
[1004.76 - 1008.48] kind of there you're seeing it on social
[1006.56 - 1009.74] more and more it's just it's gonna be
[1008.48 - 1012.98] out of control five years from now
[1009.74 - 1014.72] everybody's sick and dying right all the
[1012.98 - 1016.46] neurological problems developing and all
[1014.72 - 1017.54] these people and all college students
[1016.46 - 1018.86] and everything else and everybody's
[1017.54 - 1021.08] gonna be on there like
[1018.86 - 1023.68] it's my hormones my doctor told me it's
[1021.08 - 1023.68] my hormones
[1023.72 - 1030.44] Kate says had amazing second pregnancy
[1026.36 - 1033.68] on medical medium going mountains
[1030.44 - 1036.86] till month nine almost no protein intake
[1033.68 - 1040.18] perfect lab work home birth a beautiful
[1036.86 - 1040.18] child incredible
[1040.22 - 1044.06] I think meant Moving Mountains
[1041.66 - 1046.16] incredible
[1044.06 - 1047.90] all right so let's let's roll you guys
[1046.16 - 1050.30] interesting interesting information
[1047.90 - 1053.24] isn't it though but you know where it's
[1050.30 - 1055.94] going and you can see it like any
[1053.24 - 1059.66] influencer basically not anyone but
[1055.94 - 1061.94] almost all young people that are
[1059.66 - 1064.10] influencers on YouTube
[1061.94 - 1065.18] like they don't know why they have their
[1064.10 - 1068.42] symptoms
[1065.18 - 1070.64] they have no idea they're like well
[1068.42 - 1072.70] I get kind of achy and pains throughout
[1070.64 - 1075.62] my body I don't have a lot of energy
[1072.70 - 1078.98] some days I feel better some days I
[1075.62 - 1081.32] don't and I'm not sleeping that great I
[1078.98 - 1085.22] went to my doctor and he said it was my
[1081.32 - 1087.14] hormones how old am I 22 years old
[1085.22 - 1090.32] it's not your hormones
[1087.14 - 1094.52] Trina P iron is a big thing going around
[1090.32 - 1096.62] ferritin anemia can you address
[1094.52 - 1098.30] well
[1096.62 - 1101.90] medical medium info is the only
[1098.30 - 1105.98] information that put that was put the
[1101.90 - 1108.92] truth about iron deficiencies out there
[1105.98 - 1111.44] and so what that truth is is that if
[1108.92 - 1113.96] you're missing the iron
[1111.44 - 1116.90] and the levels are low
[1113.96 - 1119.00] and something is eating the iron
[1116.90 - 1122.06] critical to know right there that piece
[1119.00 - 1125.24] of information is critical and
[1122.06 - 1127.64] I was looking for my little virus
[1125.24 - 1129.26] but what happens people don't realize is
[1127.64 - 1132.92] iron
[1129.26 - 1134.84] is a food source for many varieties of
[1132.92 - 1137.36] Epstein-Barr virus
[1134.84 - 1140.96] not all varieties of Epstein-Barr virus
[1137.36 - 1143.18] but many varieties of Epstein-Barr virus
[1140.96 - 1145.34] and so
[1143.18 - 1149.02] um
[1145.34 - 1149.02] got some iron in your bloodstream
[1149.48 - 1154.70] and then a low-grade viral infection
[1152.84 - 1156.86] medical research design doesn't know
[1154.70 - 1159.26] that the low-grade viral infection is
[1156.86 - 1161.60] feeding off of the iron
[1159.26 - 1162.98] that's how it works people with serious
[1161.60 - 1165.62] iron deficiencies are getting blood
[1162.98 - 1167.18] transfusions because they're so high in
[1165.62 - 1169.28] a viral load
[1167.18 - 1173.00] that the viral load is gobbling and
[1169.28 - 1175.94] gobbling all their iron up in their body
[1173.00 - 1178.10] so Spirit of compassion always told me
[1175.94 - 1179.60] to help somebody get past this someday
[1178.10 - 1181.82] in their life they have to get the viral
[1179.60 - 1183.32] infections down but if the doctors and
[1181.82 - 1185.54] the medical industry don't know about
[1183.32 - 1187.70] their viral infection how are they going
[1185.54 - 1189.74] to get their iron fixed and they end up
[1187.70 - 1191.48] in this vicious cycle
[1189.74 - 1193.34] they have to try to change your diet
[1191.48 - 1195.14] they try to do different things and some
[1193.34 - 1196.82] of it's hit and miss where their iron
[1195.14 - 1198.98] gets a little stronger
[1196.82 - 1201.26] because they're taking Foods out that
[1198.98 - 1202.76] are feeding the viruses as well
[1201.26 - 1204.80] and so they get a little bit of a
[1202.76 - 1207.08] benefit but if you don't know the truth
[1204.80 - 1209.12] of what to really do of what foods to
[1207.08 - 1211.76] remove that feed the virus
[1209.12 - 1214.22] and how to go after the virus
[1211.76 - 1217.28] and how to keep the immune system strong
[1214.22 - 1220.22] to go after the virus then the iron in
[1217.28 - 1221.18] that person get gets eaten and eaten and
[1220.22 - 1223.34] eaten
[1221.18 - 1226.40] and then blood transfer blood
[1223.34 - 1227.90] transfusions are needed periodically
[1226.40 - 1229.88] because
[1227.90 - 1232.46] there's a viral infection and the virus
[1229.88 - 1234.80] is feeding off the eye
[1232.46 - 1237.56] and where'd my line go there's my lime
[1234.80 - 1238.94] I'm in such a bad mood today I need the
[1237.56 - 1241.04] mood shifter
[1238.94 - 1243.74] can you tell I'm in a bad mood today you
[1241.04 - 1246.98] guys can you actually tell
[1243.74 - 1251.54] I'm not in that bad of a mood
[1246.98 - 1253.70] but I would like the mood shifter indeed
[1251.54 - 1255.86] um during pregnancy it's common to be
[1253.70 - 1259.28] low in iron because Epstein-Barr
[1255.86 - 1261.98] infections tend to evolve during
[1259.28 - 1265.40] pregnancies if a woman is dealing with a
[1261.98 - 1268.46] low-grade viral infection already and so
[1265.40 - 1270.02] the immune system is gear a woman's
[1268.46 - 1271.52] immune system is geared on protecting
[1270.02 - 1273.14] the reproductive system that's not
[1271.52 - 1274.28] science research that's medical medium
[1273.14 - 1276.44] science right
[1274.28 - 1277.70] and it's protecting the the reproductive
[1276.44 - 1279.92] system
[1277.70 - 1281.72] and uh and then you can have a viral
[1279.92 - 1283.70] load that ends up taking advantage of
[1281.72 - 1285.74] that and that viral load can be gobbling
[1283.70 - 1288.38] up iron all through the body it's just
[1285.74 - 1290.60] it's crazy how it works YouTube Jackie
[1288.38 - 1292.46] says
[1290.60 - 1295.10] uh wow
[1292.46 - 1297.38] and years ago they put me on iron pills
[1295.10 - 1299.24] feeding the EBV this makes sense I
[1297.38 - 1301.10] became worse yes and that that leads me
[1299.24 - 1303.02] to the next point I wanted to say thank
[1301.10 - 1304.94] you for actually leaving that comment on
[1303.02 - 1306.92] YouTube which God bless you
[1304.94 - 1309.38] what people don't realize is that so
[1306.92 - 1311.84] many people have tried the iron pills
[1309.38 - 1314.00] for their anemia and then when they did
[1311.84 - 1315.44] the iron pills they got sicker and they
[1314.00 - 1316.82] were going back to their doctor like I
[1315.44 - 1319.40] can't take these iron pills I'm getting
[1316.82 - 1321.92] sicker and sicker and sicker but what
[1319.40 - 1323.90] the doctor did not know medical research
[1321.92 - 1326.54] design did not know is the viral
[1323.90 - 1328.52] infection was feeding off of more iron
[1326.54 - 1331.04] so the iron pills were going in and the
[1328.52 - 1333.32] virus was feeding off the iron pills and
[1331.04 - 1335.60] then the virus was getting stronger and
[1333.32 - 1336.62] then person was getting sicker see how
[1335.60 - 1338.60] it works
[1336.62 - 1339.70] and that's medical medium Advanced
[1338.60 - 1343.64] information
[1339.70 - 1346.76] extremely Advanced all of it I mean I
[1343.64 - 1348.74] cover that in book one medical medium
[1346.76 - 1350.90] if you don't have the books go to the
[1348.74 - 1353.30] library and get all of them out or go to
[1350.90 - 1355.52] Amazon and get it if there's a discount
[1353.30 - 1357.62] on all my books right now on Amazon get

[1357.62 - 1365.00] start studying become become an expert
[1362.48 - 1368.12] you know for yourself start studying get
[1365.00 - 1369.74] Liver Rescue spend time and read the
[1368.12 - 1373.04] books get cleansed heal get
[1369.74 - 1375.14] life-changing Foods get thyroid healing
[1373.04 - 1377.90] I don't have them out here right now get
[1375.14 - 1382.88] the brain saver books
[1377.90 - 1384.98] Juden said told low in iron two and was
[1382.88 - 1387.20] sick for the pills absolutely
[1384.98 - 1389.78] uh crystal says yes I was taking on her
[1387.20 - 1391.94] pills during pregnancy so okay for okay
[1389.78 - 1394.28] here's an example of how incredible
[1391.94 - 1395.84] Spirit of compassion's information is I
[1394.28 - 1399.14] wanted to say something
[1395.84 - 1401.60] Lana Marquis says that must be why I was
[1399.14 - 1403.40] anemic when pregnant the only time I
[1401.60 - 1405.44] ever was anemic absolutely because when
[1403.40 - 1407.84] you're pregnant
[1405.44 - 1410.30] almost all your immune system a big hunk
[1407.84 - 1413.24] of it is going to the baby
[1410.30 - 1414.92] it's protecting the baby in the womb
[1413.24 - 1417.26] that means you have less immune system
[1414.92 - 1419.84] everywhere else viral infections go up
[1417.26 - 1422.06] you go anemic when pregnant
[1419.84 - 1423.68] um and here's another thing here's this
[1422.06 - 1425.66] is critical like
[1423.68 - 1426.86] Spirit of compassion's information is so
[1425.66 - 1430.46] advanced
[1426.86 - 1432.80] there are millions of women
[1430.46 - 1435.86] they go on the iron pills and get sicker
[1432.80 - 1440.24] and science research has no idea why
[1435.86 - 1441.92] but this info is so Advanced it provides
[1440.24 - 1444.20] an answer
[1441.92 - 1445.94] just like the blood draw information is
[1444.20 - 1448.22] so Advanced it provides answers for
[1445.94 - 1449.90] people like it's incredible preeclampsia
[1448.22 - 1452.42] is Epstein-Barr infection
[1449.90 - 1454.28] to preeclampsias it's a viral infection
[1452.42 - 1457.16] it's a viral load that's somebody who's
[1454.28 - 1459.02] really got a viral infection
[1457.16 - 1460.10] and you know what size research will
[1459.02 - 1463.10] take this
[1460.10 - 1465.26] they'll call me a quack or something and
[1463.10 - 1467.12] they'll take the information they do it
[1465.26 - 1469.04] every day the clinics are taking
[1467.12 - 1470.72] published medical meme information and
[1469.04 - 1472.70] putting it in their little write-ups on
[1470.72 - 1474.32] diseases and symptoms right now we know
[1472.70 - 1475.76] we're cataloging it we're watching it
[1474.32 - 1477.80] and we can't even we're seeing it before
[1475.76 - 1480.68] our eyes we're like oh you're getting
[1477.80 - 1482.90] the letter because that's illegal to do
[1480.68 - 1484.70] they're taking published medical medium
[1482.90 - 1486.98] information because science research has
[1484.70 - 1489.74] no info at all to offer for anybody they
[1486.98 - 1491.78] never did they're taking a decade of
[1489.74 - 1493.28] answers and plugging it into all the
[1491.78 - 1494.72] clinics in the clinic search engines
[1493.28 - 1496.88] right now
[1494.72 - 1497.90] without having any proof that they had
[1496.88 - 1500.24] it first
[1497.90 - 1503.12] it's actually disgusting
[1500.24 - 1505.34] I'm in such a bad mood now for real I do
[1503.12 - 1507.92] need the moon shifter I have put myself
[1505.34 - 1510.32] in a bad mood apparently by talking
[1507.92 - 1512.12] about that
[1510.32 - 1514.04] don't worry that's just medical medium
[1512.12 - 1516.20] woes
[1514.04 - 1519.10] I will get a mood shifter in me in no
[1516.20 - 1519.10] time all right let's get going
[1520.88 - 1526.10] we often hear mood changes become blamed
[1523.22 - 1529.40] on hormone imbalances whether puberty a
[1526.10 - 1532.88] menstrual cycle or menopause
[1529.40 - 1534.02] hormonal shifts are an easy target it's
[1532.88 - 1537.80] your hormones
[1534.02 - 1540.08] be quiet shut up it's your hormones
[1537.80 - 1542.24] the truth is that there's much more to
[1540.08 - 1544.16] mood changes than hormone fluctuations
[1542.24 - 1546.44] uh-huh
[1544.16 - 1548.18] there's so much more to mood changes
[1546.44 - 1549.68] than hormone fluctuations there's so
[1548.18 - 1552.68] much more to every symptom and condition
[1549.68 - 1554.06] than calling it hormones
[1552.68 - 1556.40] Jackie
[1554.06 - 1558.26] aw you helped to bring my niece into
[1556.40 - 1559.70] this world a few months ago are you
[1558.26 - 1561.68] going to try to get me all emotional
[1559.70 - 1564.68] where I have to almost start crying my
[1561.68 - 1567.20] sister kept having miscarriages until I
[1564.68 - 1569.30] showed her the medical medium way
[1567.20 - 1572.30] God bless you
[1569.30 - 1574.46] this Mandalorian I think it was is it
[1572.30 - 1577.48] this is the way
[1574.46 - 1577.48] I'm Mandalorian
[1578.00 - 1582.62] I think there's a new season coming out
[1579.62 - 1585.82] unless it's my imagination and I think
[1582.62 - 1585.82] I'm wrong I don't know
[1585.98 - 1590.18] the truth is that there's much more to
[1588.08 - 1593.00] mood changes than hormone fluctuations
[1590.18 - 1594.98] when someone's altered state of mind
[1593.00 - 1597.32] isn't the result of something
[1594.98 - 1599.06] emotionally challenging or traumatic
[1597.32 - 1602.30] happening in the Life One common cause
[1599.06 - 1604.40] of irritability or the blues is toxic
[1602.30 - 1608.68] blood
[1604.40 - 1612.86] I don't want to keep on complaining here
[1608.68 - 1614.24] I almost can't stand myself
[1612.86 - 1616.16] but
[1614.24 - 1617.78] there's now like doctors out there
[1616.16 - 1619.46] stealing this
[1617.78 - 1620.78] from medical medium books and putting it
[1619.46 - 1622.70] in ads
[1620.78 - 1625.22] toxic blood
[1622.70 - 1627.14] and and dirty blood syndrome Everything
[1625.22 - 1629.42] Medical medium published and they're
[1627.14 - 1631.46] just taking it and running
[1629.42 - 1633.56] do you think there's like a hell for all
[1631.46 - 1635.18] these people or something like you know
[1633.56 - 1638.54] what I mean when we leave here and you
[1635.18 - 1640.42] did so many like deceitful things or do
[1638.54 - 1643.88] you think that doesn't exist
[1640.42 - 1645.98] you know what I mean like it's like you
[1643.88 - 1648.38] just go to the greatest Heaven there
[1645.98 - 1651.32] ever was doesn't matter how many people
[1648.38 - 1653.24] you s you know you drew to a different
[1651.32 - 1655.40] direction and their house just their
[1653.24 - 1657.74] health just went crashed and they went
[1655.40 - 1659.84] through hell and they
[1657.74 - 1662.00] they you know like because when you
[1659.84 - 1664.64] think about it if you're gonna steal all
[1662.00 - 1666.92] the info out of the books
[1664.64 - 1669.50] but not tell them where it comes from
[1666.92 - 1670.94] and then they stay sick and they lose 10
[1669.50 - 1672.56] years of their life and their children
[1670.94 - 1675.02] are sick don't you think that's just
[1672.56 - 1678.14] kind of like wrong
[1675.02 - 1680.42] ah right
[1678.14 - 1682.88] and it wouldn't be so bad if they keep
[1680.42 - 1685.34] on stealing the medical meme information
[1682.88 - 1687.68] if they if they didn't call me like
[1685.34 - 1690.02] names while they were doing it and say
[1687.68 - 1691.46] that I'm not a trusted reliable source
[1690.02 - 1694.58] but they keep on
[1691.46 - 1696.26] taking the info non-stop right now
[1694.58 - 1698.36] this look we're doing the mood shifter
[1696.26 - 1699.62] today so I just thought that I would
[1698.36 - 1702.50] talk about this a little bit with you
[1699.62 - 1704.30] guys because it puts me in a bad mood so
[1702.50 - 1705.74] it's perfect timing for the mood shifter
[1704.30 - 1708.80] I'm actually excited
[1705.74 - 1710.36] the point I'm trying to say is I can't
[1708.80 - 1711.62] even read a sentence now that they're
[1710.36 - 1715.04] not taking
[1711.62 - 1716.54] that's it's actually like mad day right
[1715.04 - 1718.70] and
[1716.54 - 1720.14] you think I wouldn't care so much if it
[1718.70 - 1721.28] didn't mean so many people are never
[1720.14 - 1722.60] going to find their way back to the
[1721.28 - 1723.56] books and they're going to stay sick for
[1722.60 - 1725.90] years
[1723.56 - 1728.62] and even die many of them
[1725.90 - 1728.62] down the road
[1729.26 - 1735.80] okay toxic blood
[1732.50 - 1738.38] toxic blood can shift the mood not
[1735.80 - 1741.02] hormones toxic blood
[1738.38 - 1743.42] even if something difficult is going on
[1741.02 - 1745.88] if that person's blood is also toxic
[1743.42 - 1748.58] they'd be more sensitive and susceptible
[1745.88 - 1751.52] to triggers from confrontation and
[1748.58 - 1753.38] conflict someone has toxic blood in
[1751.52 - 1755.42] their body and they run into
[1753.38 - 1756.86] confrontation they're going to be in a
[1755.42 - 1758.84] bad mood
[1756.86 - 1760.22] it's like what did you say
[1758.84 - 1761.84] what
[1760.22 - 1763.64] did you wait a minute wait a minute did
[1761.84 - 1766.58] you just say that to me
[1763.64 - 1769.04] did you just say I was ugly
[1766.58 - 1770.78] like why would you say that but since I
[1769.04 - 1773.00] have really toxic blood I'm going to be
[1770.78 - 1775.10] in a worse mood about that
[1773.00 - 1777.14] I can't shake that off
[1775.10 - 1778.88] did that really hurt my feelings I'm
[1777.14 - 1779.60] angry about it now you just called me
[1778.88 - 1782.54] ugly
[1779.60 - 1784.28] my toxic blood is boiling inside of me
[1782.54 - 1786.32] right now because I have toxic thick
[1784.28 - 1789.26] blood dirty blood syndrome
[1786.32 - 1791.06] and my toxic blood is is like making it
[1789.26 - 1793.04] so I'm triggered easier so if you call
[1791.06 - 1795.02] me ugly one more time I'm really gonna
[1793.04 - 1798.82] get upset oh there you go you just held
[1795.02 - 1798.82] me ugly again now I'm really upset
[1800.06 - 1807.50] this is what I call Dirty blood syndrome
[1803.18 - 1809.24] when blood is toxic it's dirty it's not
[1807.50 - 1811.04] clean blood
[1809.24 - 1812.48] it's like if I had to get a BL if I had
[1811.04 - 1815.98] to a bad car accident or something like
[1812.48 - 1815.98] that and had to get a blood transfusion
[1816.14 - 1821.42] and I was still conscious I'd be like
[1818.12 - 1823.22] don't give me someone's don't give me
[1821.42 - 1826.10] the blood from someone that has dirty
[1823.22 - 1827.90] blood syndrome please
[1826.10 - 1830.30] spread of compassion would be like I
[1827.90 - 1832.88] would be asking questions being like
[1830.30 - 1834.80] spirit is the blood that I'm getting is
[1832.88 - 1837.62] it from something yeah it's from a
[1834.80 - 1840.68] really dirty blood syndrome person their
[1837.62 - 1843.86] blood is toxic great put it in me
[1840.68 - 1846.02] Lorraine L they took three big vials of
[1843.86 - 1848.54] blood to test my hormones and I hated it
[1846.02 - 1850.76] in comparison to some people that have
[1848.54 - 1852.92] blood drawn I know this isn't much but
[1850.76 - 1855.98] it still felt so obsessive I felt really
[1852.92 - 1858.02] quasiately okay
[1855.98 - 1859.70] I have a lot to say about
[1858.02 - 1861.86] drop blood draw
[1859.70 - 1863.78] a lot to say
[1861.86 - 1865.52] anybody who listens to the blood draw
[1863.78 - 1866.90] podcast the medical meme podcast at
[1865.52 - 1870.14] Apple podcast could have their lives
[1866.90 - 1873.50] safe but even better than that
[1870.14 - 1876.44] I gotta I got protocols in here
[1873.50 - 1878.54] the brain saver books
[1876.44 - 1880.58] I have a blood draw chapter in here that
[1878.54 - 1883.82] will blow your mind
[1880.58 - 1887.72] blow your mind you have to be educated
[1883.82 - 1890.60] about blood draw it's critical right now
[1887.72 - 1893.30] because yes three full vials of blood
[1890.60 - 1896.24] can knock somebody back
[1893.30 - 1900.14] so you're not you're you're
[1896.24 - 1904.22] complaint Lorraine is actually valid
[1900.14 - 1907.34] a hundred percent valid you felt queasy
[1904.22 - 1909.62] I know three full vials someone can be
[1907.34 - 1911.60] hit from that it's no joke never mind
[1909.62 - 1913.94] five miles seven vials ten vials 15
[1911.60 - 1916.16] vials by the way I'm talking about blood
[1913.94 - 1919.46] draw because Lorraine you mentioned it
[1916.16 - 1921.20] but also because that can really change
[1919.46 - 1924.44] moods in people when they're getting too
[1921.20 - 1926.90] much blood drawn really change moods
[1924.44 - 1928.88] all their glucose goes out the door like
[1926.90 - 1930.50] a lot of glucose so electrolytes go out
[1928.88 - 1931.88] the door their immune system goes out
[1930.50 - 1933.62] the door I've talked about this for so
[1931.88 - 1936.38] many times so many years the trace
[1933.62 - 1940.18] minerals go out the door
[1936.38 - 1940.18] trace minerals glucose
[1940.46 - 1947.36] right so all of that electrolytes
[1944.72 - 1950.72] macro minerals specially go out the door
[1947.36 - 1952.52] all of that is just boom and then how
[1950.72 - 1955.00] are people going to recover that glass
[1952.52 - 1955.00] of water
[1955.22 - 1958.64] I mean
[1956.36 - 1960.92] you're you when you fill up with fluids
[1958.64 - 1963.50] and eat you're not restoring your blood
[1960.92 - 1965.96] what's in your blood so fast you're just
[1963.50 - 1968.06] restoring water content too and that's
[1965.96 - 1969.92] that's not all the bulk of your blood
[1968.06 - 1972.26] water content does not restore your
[1969.92 - 1974.06] immune system
[1972.26 - 1976.04] anyway yeah
[1974.06 - 1979.04] so many Hot Topics right here to talk
[1976.04 - 1981.38] about you know hot spots seriously

[2244.42 - 2251.70] two-year arthritis oh my God
[2248.38 - 2251.70] for the Newbie here
[2253.42 - 2258.04] I just got one thing to say when I bring
[2255.64 - 2260.28] out Dr Nesbitt from his surgery later do
[2258.04 - 2260.28] not
[2260.64 - 2266.08] do not not be a newbie anymore and then
[2263.44 - 2268.42] don't say bye
[2266.08 - 2270.64] stick around for Dr Nesbit
[2268.42 - 2273.28] no seriously though um thank you for
[2270.64 - 2275.80] reading the books and yes it's truth
[2273.28 - 2278.08] Jackie B I'm so glad we learned the mm
[2275.80 - 2280.42] info about blood draws now my husband
[2278.08 - 2283.48] asked them to take half files and he
[2280.42 - 2286.30] doesn't feel as awful afterward there
[2283.48 - 2287.80] are serious ramifications from blood
[2286.30 - 2290.56] draw
[2287.80 - 2291.94] that go beyond anything anybody can even
[2290.56 - 2294.52] imagine
[2291.94 - 2296.20] I believe in getting blood work done for
[2294.52 - 2297.82] people I want people to go to their
[2296.20 - 2299.20] doctors and get blood work absolutely
[2297.82 - 2301.84] there's nothing wrong with that if the
[2299.20 - 2303.94] doctor wants it the point is is you have
[2301.84 - 2306.70] to learn how to protect yourself because
[2303.94 - 2309.40] the implications the ramifications are
[2306.70 - 2311.26] serious they're dire
[2309.40 - 2314.34] especially if you're struggling with any
[2311.26 - 2314.34] kind of condition or symptom
[2320.92 - 2326.08] toxic heavy metals such as mercury and
[2323.26 - 2330.70] aluminum can sit inside the brain
[2326.08 - 2333.16] and cause mood changes all on their own
[2330.70 - 2335.50] toxic heavy metals wreak havoc on
[2333.16 - 2337.48] people's brains
[2335.50 - 2339.46] they can get a diagnosis of any kind
[2337.48 - 2341.32] schizophrenia bipolar OCD
[2339.46 - 2344.44] depersonalization depression anxiety
[2341.32 - 2348.48] ever and 10 000 other diagnoses that are
[2344.44 - 2348.48] brain related with toxic heavy metals
[2352.06 - 2355.60] and they can that can happen without the
[2354.04 - 2356.80] liver being toxic in dirty blood
[2355.60 - 2359.26] syndrome
[2356.80 - 2361.12] viruses inside the liver can feed off of
[2359.26 - 2363.40] toxic heavy metals and release different
[2361.12 - 2365.50] Brews of neurotoxins
[2363.40 - 2368.02] some more potent than others which get
[2365.50 - 2372.78] to the brain and make the brain Go funny
[2368.02 - 2372.78] where oh my God I'm having mood changes
[2373.78 - 2377.86] over here on Rumble
[2375.46 - 2380.86] Neato 1988.
[2377.86 - 2383.32] I had low iron most of my life not now
[2380.86 - 2385.78] since on medical medium protocols
[2383.32 - 2389.16] thank you Rumble person for being here
[2385.78 - 2389.16] and thank you for commenting
[2395.20 - 2400.00] everything
[2397.42 - 2402.16] is different in how their body handles a
[2400.00 - 2404.86] toxic load everybody's different
[2402.16 - 2407.44] one thing about medical medium info
[2404.86 - 2410.58] one it's not one size fits all
[2407.44 - 2410.58] it's quite the opposite
[2410.86 - 2415.36] PK asks the aliens get moody
[2413.86 - 2416.68] I would love to answer that question
[2415.36 - 2418.84] right now
[2416.68 - 2421.24] see one person may not be swayed too
[2418.84 - 2422.98] easily to a dark place when their liver
[2421.24 - 2424.72] blood and brain are overloaded with
[2422.98 - 2426.04] toxic waste and poisons another person
[2424.72 - 2429.82] can be
[2426.04 - 2431.86] can be persuaded by it
[2429.82 - 2433.72] and go through a dark play be in a dark
[2431.86 - 2436.06] place and struggle when someone is
[2433.72 - 2437.32] highly toxic mood changes can fluctuate
[2436.06 - 2439.18] up and down
[2437.32 - 2441.76] high in laho
[2439.18 - 2444.58] pan when you're toxic
[2441.76 - 2446.20] smooth changes can fluctuate all over
[2444.58 - 2448.62] the place but it'll be blamed on
[2446.20 - 2448.62] hormones
[2449.20 - 2455.22] when someone's highly toxic mood changes
[2451.90 - 2455.22] can fluctuate up and down
[2455.68 - 2461.26] you can go to a new doctor
[2458.80 - 2463.92] if they won't listen about taking your
[2461.26 - 2463.92] blood draws
[2464.26 - 2467.62] if they won't listen about the
[2465.82 - 2469.42] information that's so critical Audrey
[2467.62 - 2471.46] Lynn says even knowing that blood draws
[2469.42 - 2473.98] are not good when you tell the nurses to
[2471.46 - 2476.08] take less they do not listen saying they
[2473.98 - 2478.00] know what is needed and I can't control
[2476.08 - 2479.68] what they take once a needle's in your
[2478.00 - 2483.40] arm first of all
[2479.68 - 2486.22] the nurses don't know
[2483.40 - 2488.08] but the lab the blood lab will still run
[2486.22 - 2489.40] the tests and have and still throw away
[2488.08 - 2490.42] the rest of your blood because they have
[2489.40 - 2492.28] too much
[2490.42 - 2494.02] you could find doctors and nurses who
[2492.28 - 2495.40] will listen and there's a lot more now
[2494.02 - 2496.96] that are listening because of the
[2495.40 - 2498.70] medical medium information out there and
[2496.96 - 2500.68] the blood draw information
[2498.70 - 2502.86] because it is spreading and getting out
[2500.68 - 2502.86] there
[2507.60 - 2513.64] vampires Juliet
[2510.28 - 2515.50] Llewellyn says I asked the doctors for
[2513.64 - 2518.14] half files and was told it couldn't be
[2515.50 - 2520.60] done as the labs need full vials
[2518.14 - 2522.82] I rang the lab in the phlebotist told me
[2520.60 - 2526.06] it would be fine as they do minimal
[2522.82 - 2528.24] amounts all the time exactly
[2526.06 - 2528.24] foreign
[2528.36 - 2532.92] Juliet because it's one big
[2534.52 - 2540.64] freaking lie
[2536.44 - 2543.34] it's one big lie
[2540.64 - 2546.22] nothing really is as we think it is
[2543.34 - 2549.12] there's so much lying going on it's sick
[2546.22 - 2549.12] in the system
[2550.18 - 2555.28] I'm kind of confused
[2552.10 - 2556.42] um how do they do a pediatric thyroid
[2555.28 - 2559.80] test
[2556.42 - 2559.80] and test all the same
[2559.84 - 2564.46] with this much blood
[2561.70 - 2566.68] from a baby can somebody tell me
[2564.46 - 2568.12] how can they can run all the entire
[2566.68 - 2570.76] thyroid profile with this much blood
[2568.12 - 2573.60] from a baby with baby vials
[2570.76 - 2573.60] can you tell me
[2574.30 - 2579.10] because it's BS and that's all they do
[2577.12 - 2581.70] is lie to every single patient it's
[2579.10 - 2581.70] sickening
[2581.74 - 2587.34] they can test your blood sugar with a
[2584.50 - 2587.34] DOT of blood
[2587.38 - 2592.72] a drop a tiny drop of blood they can
[2590.74 - 2594.76] take blood that's on somebody's blue
[2592.72 - 2597.82] jeans that's sitting in a shallow grave
[2594.76 - 2601.00] because they were murdered 45 years ago
[2597.82 - 2603.10] and they can scrape that blood and get a
[2601.00 - 2606.70] whole reading nutrient deficiencies
[2603.10 - 2609.70] thyroid profile liver enzymes with a
[2606.70 - 2612.64] speck of dried out blood sitting in blue
[2609.70 - 2615.10] jeans 45 years ago in a grave
[2612.64 - 2616.72] oh but they need all that blood or they
[2615.10 - 2618.94] need they need all that blood from you
[2616.72 - 2621.52] sure it's a scam
[2618.94 - 2624.34] read about it in the books pick up the
[2621.52 - 2627.22] books get the brain saver book learn
[2624.34 - 2630.66] read about it because
[2627.22 - 2630.66] they're gonna get you one day
[2630.76 - 2634.12] and they'll get you in a vicious cycle
[2632.56 - 2635.50] and they'll drain your blood and drain
[2634.12 - 2637.54] your blood and drain your blood people
[2635.50 - 2638.80] die from it all the time that's all they
[2637.54 - 2640.84] get sicker and they take more blood
[2638.80 - 2643.56] sicker take more blood sicker and they
[2640.84 - 2643.56] just pick on
[2644.86 - 2649.72] all the blood donating to all the all
[2647.26 - 2651.04] the donating blood
[2649.72 - 2652.06] right
[2651.04 - 2654.22] that
[2652.06 - 2656.56] everybody does
[2654.22 - 2658.42] it doesn't go to hospitals where does it
[2656.56 - 2659.92] go well a fraction of it goes to
[2658.42 - 2661.48] hospitals where's the rest of it go I'm
[2659.92 - 2664.18] kind of curious
[2661.48 - 2667.24] are they feeding aliens where's it going
[2664.18 - 2669.22] is somebody drinking it I'd love to know
[2667.24 - 2671.04] guess who's donating blood
[2669.22 - 2673.84] sick women
[2671.04 - 2675.52] 99.9 of all blood donors are sick women
[2673.84 - 2676.72] why are they telling sick women to
[2675.52 - 2679.08] donate their blood and get rid of all
[2676.72 - 2679.08] their blood
[2684.46 - 2689.46] and who's who's your
[2685.96 - 2689.46] cause it's not going to the hospitals
[2689.86 - 2692.98] I'm kind of like confused on that one
[2691.60 - 2695.08] because it's not
[2692.98 - 2699.24] where's it going
[2695.08 - 2699.24] is somebody drinking it I'd love to know
[2699.58 - 2704.68] Jackie B my husband insisted he warned
[2702.22 - 2708.40] them that he has to lay down afterward
[2704.68 - 2710.62] if they do full vials
[2708.40 - 2713.32] that's just the immediate effect
[2710.62 - 2715.06] that's not like a year from now
[2713.32 - 2716.26] after you lost part of your immune
[2715.06 - 2717.82] system and it took six months to get
[2716.26 - 2718.96] your immune system back the effects
[2717.82 - 2721.30] later
[2718.96 - 2723.94] I talk about it in the book here
[2721.30 - 2725.74] you guys I'm in an awful mood today do
[2723.94 - 2728.14] we have anything for that do you have
[2725.74 - 2731.20] anything to offer for because I'm in a
[2728.14 - 2733.62] bad mood is there anything I we can do
[2731.20 - 2737.26] the mood shifter Maria
[2733.62 - 2742.08] says I thought a lot of my issues hold
[2737.26 - 2742.08] on hold on Maria it went somewhere
[2742.84 - 2748.08] screen literally went boo and it was
[2745.90 - 2748.08] gone
[2751.06 - 2755.32] what happened
[2753.28 - 2757.48] all right let's keep on going here when
[2755.32 - 2760.02] we find that comment if I can possibly
[2757.48 - 2760.02] find it
[2763.48 - 2768.04] another person with similar toxic loads
[2765.76 - 2770.08] may feel something terrible another
[2768.04 - 2771.94] person may not when someone's highly
[2770.08 - 2774.10] when someone is highly toxic their mood
[2771.94 - 2775.84] changes can fluctuate up and down high
[2774.10 - 2779.28] and low and this could lead to a
[2775.84 - 2781.78] diagnosis like bipolar disorder
[2779.28 - 2785.26] depression seasonal infective disorder
[2781.78 - 2787.78] sad right Tourette's
[2785.26 - 2790.18] or OCD how many people get diagnosed
[2787.78 - 2794.58] with Tourette's syndrome
[2790.18 - 2794.58] when there's just really toxic
[2798.82 - 2803.56] why does mood Express itself differently
[2801.46 - 2805.18] in two people with similar toxic loads
[2803.56 - 2807.28] childhood can play a role if someone
[2805.18 - 2809.92] grew up with tremendous family stability
[2807.28 - 2812.26] check that out right
[2809.92 - 2815.62] if someone grew up
[2812.26 - 2817.96] with tremendous family stability in
[2815.62 - 2820.42] early years that gave them confidence
[2817.96 - 2822.64] and emotional support that can
[2820.42 - 2824.92] strengthen their path and journey
[2822.64 - 2826.90] someone else might have lacked that
[2824.92 - 2829.12] emotional support growing up
[2826.90 - 2830.74] one person might have had all the
[2829.12 - 2832.42] resources they needed when they were
[2830.74 - 2835.36] young and another person might have
[2832.42 - 2836.86] struggled with very few resources and
[2835.36 - 2839.92] unpredictability
[2836.86 - 2842.38] that chain that tends to change people
[2839.92 - 2844.60] that can make a difference between
[2842.38 - 2845.92] just like differences with someone who's
[2844.60 - 2847.66] just as toxic as the other person
[2845.92 - 2849.94] they're both toxic but yet see the
[2847.66 - 2852.72] similar things can change
[2849.94 - 2852.72] in each person
[2856.30 - 2861.48] there is a full chapter on blood draw in
[2858.88 - 2861.48] brain saver
[2861.52 - 2864.46] when I was begging you guys to learn
[2863.08 - 2866.56] about it I was
[2864.46 - 2868.78] begging for you guys to read the chapter
[2866.56 - 2872.76] and study it
[2868.78 - 2872.76] and hold on to that information
[2874.48 - 2878.70] you know
[2876.06 - 2882.58] what's really like
[2878.70 - 2885.82] so crazy with medical medium information
[2882.58 - 2887.26] is that I always for some reason I think
[2885.82 - 2890.26] that everybody
[2887.26 - 2892.30] in the community knows it
[2890.26 - 2895.24] and it throws me every time where I'm
[2892.30 - 2897.28] like okay well I did the blood draw
[2895.24 - 2899.56] podcast episode
[2897.28 - 2901.24] years ago
[2899.56 - 2903.04] but like when I talk about blood draw
[2901.24 - 2904.66] everybody's like what what are you
[2903.04 - 2906.52] talking about
[2904.66 - 2907.72] it like happens like that every second
[2906.52 - 2909.46] it's like
[2907.72 - 2912.46] it's almost like
[2909.46 - 2914.80] it's a community but I think for some
[2912.46 - 2916.96] reason everybody knows the info
[2914.80 - 2919.06] but then I realized
[2916.96 - 2920.44] there's probably a huge amount of the
[2919.06 - 2923.74] community that doesn't have all the
[2920.44 - 2924.94] books or maybe not even read one but
[2923.74 - 2926.92] they're here and I'm glad they're here
[2924.94 - 2930.58] I'm grateful they're here but the point
[2926.92 - 2932.14] is is that I realize that you can be in
[2930.58 - 2935.74] the medical medium community and not
[2932.14 - 2938.02] even even heard the blood draw problem
[2935.74 - 2940.18] you can be in the mm community and not
[2938.02 - 2941.20] even know Epstein-Barr causes this or
[2940.18 - 2943.18] that
[2941.20 - 2944.50] you can be like in the mm community and
[2943.18 - 2947.56] be like that's the first time I ever
[2944.50 - 2949.48] heard that about blood draw what
[2947.56 - 2951.58] you can be in the mm community and be
[2949.48 - 2953.32] like who's Dr Nesbitt
[2951.58 - 2956.46] it's it's just it just blows me away
[2953.32 - 2956.46] every time I'm like
[2959.38 - 2965.82] then there's an individual soul itself
[2962.74 - 2965.82] okay let's talk about the soul
[2967.00 - 2972.28] see Loney says when I was at the
[2969.70 - 2974.14] hospital all the time and got a lot of
[2972.28 - 2976.66] blood drawn I went into the hospital
[2974.14 - 2977.56] walking came out in a wheelchair every
[2976.66 - 2979.66] time
[2977.56 - 2981.34] I had to heal myself with a lot of B12
[2979.66 - 2984.70] for weeks
[2981.34 - 2988.12] it's really sad because
[2984.70 - 2991.12] the system is set up
[2988.12 - 2993.70] to drain a sick person's
[2991.12 - 2996.76] vitality
[2993.70 - 2998.68] robbing and stealing their blood
[2996.76 - 3001.28] when they don't need that much blood for
[2998.68 - 3001.28] the tests
[3002.16 - 3007.14] the sick person gets sicker
[3004.74 - 3009.60] and sicker and sicker and when the sick
[3007.14 - 3012.84] person gets sicker
[3009.60 - 3015.96] the doctors take more blood
[3012.84 - 3018.00] then the sick person gets even sicker
[3015.96 - 3019.98] and then the doctors say well you need
[3018.00 - 3021.36] to come in for more blood now
[3019.98 - 3022.56] because you're sicker and we need to
[3021.36 - 3025.50] know why
[3022.56 - 3027.78] eventually the person
[3025.50 - 3029.46] is too sick
[3027.78 - 3031.20] it's the saddest thing I've ever seen
[3029.46 - 3033.06] out there
[3031.20 - 3035.04] is a reason you have that much blood
[3033.06 - 3037.68] circulating in your body your body isn't
[3035.04 - 3040.14] a blood bag that just could be like
[3037.68 - 3042.30] squeezed out anywhere like a ketchup
[3040.14 - 3046.10] bottle
[3042.30 - 3046.10] at a busy picnic table
[3048.12 - 3052.38] where everybody's slapping ketchup on
[3050.10 - 3054.42] hot dogs and hamburgers left and right
[3052.38 - 3056.40] people are really depleted and low
[3054.42 - 3057.96] already with nutrients they have
[3056.40 - 3059.70] deficiencies they have electrolyte
[3057.96 - 3061.86] deficiencies they don't have enough B12
[3059.70 - 3064.02] in their their brain people already have
[3061.86 - 3065.76] enough problems take too much blood out
[3064.02 - 3067.56] of them and constantly take blood out of
[3065.76 - 3069.66] them and they never restore I mean Jesus
[3067.56 - 3072.98] Christ it's a serious problem it could
[3069.66 - 3072.98] really go really bad
[3073.50 - 3077.94] foreign
[3075.14 - 3080.54] and yes I said Jesus
[3077.94 - 3080.54] anyway
[3083.04 - 3086.76] Loney said I get kicked out of medical
[3085.02 - 3089.04] medium groups for sharing your exact
[3086.76 - 3090.06] words I hear that all the time Loney I
[3089.04 - 3093.18] hear there's a lot of medical meaning
[3090.06 - 3096.06] groups that are just bait they're bait
[3093.18 - 3097.26] to get people in to push them to a
[3096.06 - 3099.54] different direction
[3097.26 - 3101.82] and so if you talk about medical medium
[3099.54 - 3104.52] info or stick up for medical medium in
[3101.82 - 3106.56] those groups they kick you out
[3104.52 - 3108.18] but they try to use the medical medium
[3106.56 - 3109.68] name and pretend it's a medical game
[3108.18 - 3111.60] group
[3109.68 - 3113.46] I'm going to be kind of hammering down a
[3111.60 - 3115.32] little bit on that because it's it's
[3113.46 - 3117.12] actually really sad it got to the point
[3115.32 - 3119.10] where I'm actually really
[3117.12 - 3122.10] scared for people who are trying to seek
[3119.10 - 3125.04] out help and heal what's happening is
[3122.10 - 3127.08] there's groups now that they
[3125.04 - 3129.00] it's not about mm info it's not about
[3127.08 - 3130.26] mmm truth it's not about any of that
[3129.00 - 3132.60] it's like
[3130.26 - 3134.70] it's not about like healing people
[3132.60 - 3136.44] really because they siphon people in
[3134.70 - 3138.30] because it's a medical meme group and
[3136.44 - 3140.88] then they try to get them doing
[3138.30 - 3142.92] different things there is one in Germany
[3140.88 - 3144.48] that was like doing that everybody went
[3142.92 - 3146.10] in it turned out it was just a medical
[3144.48 - 3147.42] meme hate group but nobody knew but
[3146.10 - 3149.16] everybody thought it was a medical
[3147.42 - 3150.66] medium group and they just filed in and
[3149.16 - 3152.58] filed in it turned out it was just a
[3150.66 - 3155.28] medical medium hate group and it was
[3152.58 - 3157.56] siphoning people in and then telling
[3155.28 - 3158.76] them all this other stuff so that you
[3157.56 - 3159.84] know like you know what I mean and it's
[3158.76 - 3161.04] like that everywhere now it's like
[3159.84 - 3162.72] there's a lot of groups not all of them
[3161.04 - 3165.42] but there's a lot of groups they're
[3162.72 - 3166.98] siphoning people in and then they're
[3165.42 - 3169.62] getting them to do this person's
[3166.98 - 3171.48] protocols this person's belief system
[3169.62 - 3173.16] this person's whatever and then you're
[3171.48 - 3174.90] back to that again okay great if that's
[3173.16 - 3176.16] what you want to do but then don't
[3174.90 - 3178.62] trick
[3176.16 - 3182.00] people and getting them in thinking it's
[3178.62 - 3182.00] going to be on them info I want to stop
[3183.90 - 3189.38] all right what a mood day okay can I
[3186.54 - 3193.34] just say this that yes
[3189.38 - 3193.34] I'm not in the greatest mood
[3195.18 - 3198.54] all right
[3196.32 - 3200.64] why does mood Express itself different
[3198.54 - 3202.86] in two people I talked about that then
[3200.64 - 3205.86] there's an individual soul itself which
[3202.86 - 3209.24] is unique to each of us your soul is
[3205.86 - 3213.36] unique my soul is unique
[3209.24 - 3216.44] your soul is unique
[3213.36 - 3216.44] critical to know
[3217.08 - 3222.18] it could be fragile from being tattered
[3219.60 - 3223.92] along the way and God knows our souls
[3222.18 - 3227.16] have been tattered along the way many
[3223.92 - 3229.44] people become wounded in life
[3227.16 - 3232.32] and soul wounds can make a person more
[3229.44 - 3233.82] sensitive too I mean a lot of us take a
[3232.32 - 3235.38] lot of heat remember I told you our soul
[3233.82 - 3237.96] gets propelled out of us so it doesn't
[3235.38 - 3239.94] get totally damaged it protects it but
[3237.96 - 3243.72] it still gets it still has to live in
[3239.94 - 3246.48] here afterwards when it comes back in
[3243.72 - 3248.76] many people believe many people become
[3246.48 - 3251.16] wounded in life and soul wounds can make
[3248.76 - 3252.84] a person more sensitive affecting how
[3251.16 - 3256.32] they cope process or deal with
[3252.84 - 3259.94] circumstances involving other people
[3256.32 - 3259.94] that can reflect the mood
[3261.66 - 3265.80] Tammy starts Ben says I was on meds
[3263.76 - 3267.66] growing up for seizures
[3265.80 - 3270.12] they took my blood every few months
[3267.66 - 3272.10] every time it would induce a seizure at
[3270.12 - 3274.02] the lab really scary I talk about that
[3272.10 - 3276.24] in brain saver
[3274.02 - 3278.34] prime example right there
[3276.24 - 3280.74] prime example because they were removing
[3278.34 - 3283.62] all the electrolytes
[3280.74 - 3286.28] grid and glucose
[3283.62 - 3286.28] critical
[3289.98 - 3294.24] someone can be dealing with all the
[3291.96 - 3295.80] above they could be so what I mean by
[3294.24 - 3297.36] that all kinds of problems that we
[3295.80 - 3299.88] already discussed about what could be a
[3297.36 - 3302.40] mood trigger they could be experiencing
[3299.88 - 3304.08] toxic heavy metals in the brain a highly
[3302.40 - 3306.54] toxic liver I talked about filled with
[3304.08 - 3308.34] pathogens and poisons that's caused it
[3306.54 - 3310.26] to become more stagnant sluggish so that
[3308.34 - 3312.36] the dirty blood develops in a tattered
[3310.26 - 3314.10] soul from a journey through life that
[3312.36 - 3317.04] has been very difficult
[3314.10 - 3318.84] all happening at once or they could be
[3317.04 - 3321.42] dealing with one factor or some
[3318.84 - 3324.90] combination everyone has a different
[3321.42 - 3326.88] variation mood is no mood is so much
[3324.90 - 3329.16] bigger than chalking it all up to
[3326.88 - 3330.30] hormones
[3329.16 - 3334.92] now don't worry it's your hormones
[3330.30 - 3334.92] there'll be another million influencers
[3335.76 - 3340.80] on social saying how every single
[3337.98 - 3343.02] problem they have is their hormones

[3458.78 - 3464.76] Catherine Elizabeth sadly my son had a
[3462.24 - 3469.08] seizure at three and a half years old
[3464.76 - 3472.46] after they took 20 vials of blood
[3469.08 - 3472.46] that will always haunt me

[3680.34 - 3685.26] blueberry powder in here and mix it
[3683.64 - 3687.60] because I'm using the powder I'm not
[3685.26 - 3690.54] using the fresh or frozen wild
[3687.60 - 3693.20] blueberries I'm using the powder in here
[3690.54 - 3693.20] foreign
[3695.66 - 3700.56] teaspoon
[3697.22 - 3704.36] pure wild blueberry powder right there I
[3700.56 - 3704.36] got Sprouts all over the container
[3705.42 - 3708.96] now what's incredible and I'm going to
[3707.34 - 3712.22] say this
[3708.96 - 3712.22] I'll say it once
[3713.94 - 3719.76] there's no anti
[3717.00 - 3721.74] bonding agents in here okay there's no
[3719.76 - 3723.96] agents in here
[3721.74 - 3726.38] what people don't realize in the powders
[3723.96 - 3726.38] out there
[3726.42 - 3733.32] they don't realize they put like an
[3730.04 - 3736.92] anti-bonding agent in the powders out
[3733.32 - 3738.48] there vimergy does not do that
[3736.92 - 3740.40] by the way you guys you know I endorse
[3738.48 - 3742.02] them the whole bit for all these reasons
[3740.40 - 3743.64] and this is one of the big ones and I
[3742.02 - 3745.50] never had a chance to ever tell you guys
[3743.64 - 3748.08] about it
[3745.50 - 3750.12] but I wanted to so I'm just gonna say it
[3748.08 - 3752.58] now
[3750.12 - 3756.00] what you'll notice the barley grass
[3752.58 - 3759.06] juice powder the spirulina
[3756.00 - 3762.06] there's no anti-caking agents in here
[3759.06 - 3763.86] critical to know
[3762.06 - 3766.56] I don't even know what to say besides
[3763.86 - 3769.26] that's the best news I can ever be
[3766.56 - 3771.00] handed in my like Consciousness my mind
[3769.26 - 3774.84] when I'm using this stuff do I want an
[3771.00 - 3776.22] anti-caking agent in my powders
[3774.84 - 3777.72] and when people don't realize when they
[3776.22 - 3779.22] buy all these powders out there all the
[3777.72 - 3781.14] green powders and these patterns and
[3779.22 - 3783.24] chlorella powders and spirulina powders
[3781.14 - 3784.38] whatever they're using they don't
[3783.24 - 3786.96] realize it
[3784.38 - 3789.14] there's an agent in there to stop the
[3786.96 - 3790.68] powder from caking
[3789.14 - 3792.66] undisclosed
[3790.68 - 3794.34] in all the powders
[3792.66 - 3796.50] keep that in mind
[3794.34 - 3798.12] and so when you're dealing with this
[3796.50 - 3802.02] company Bemidji
[3798.12 - 3804.66] they don't put that powder in the powder
[3802.02 - 3806.88] they don't do that anti-bonding agent
[3804.66 - 3809.28] anti-caking agent
[3806.88 - 3811.92] inside the powder
[3809.28 - 3814.02] and so okay fine then you might get
[3811.92 - 3815.88] clumpiness but I will take clumpiness
[3814.02 - 3818.88] any day
[3815.88 - 3820.92] any day this is incredible stuff right
[3818.88 - 3822.42] here you see where like one might be a
[3820.92 - 3824.34] little clumped together
[3822.42 - 3827.28] I don't care if there's a little
[3824.34 - 3829.32] clumpiness going on I know how clean and
[3827.28 - 3832.38] pure that stuff is
[3829.32 - 3834.00] because I don't have to say oh great uh
[3832.38 - 3837.06] I'm using a pattern has all that
[3834.00 - 3839.10] antibody bonding agents in here
[3837.06 - 3843.54] like that's disgusting like I don't want
[3839.10 - 3845.88] to eat that so memory from my knowledge
[3843.54 - 3847.20] is the only company that doesn't use
[3845.88 - 3849.24] that stuff
[3847.20 - 3850.80] I wanted to make that clear because what
[3849.24 - 3852.42] people don't realize
[3850.80 - 3853.56] when they use the barley grass juice
[3852.42 - 3856.80] powder
[3853.56 - 3858.54] that if it's clumped together
[3856.80 - 3862.14] it's a good thing
[3858.54 - 3864.50] that means they didn't put that
[3862.14 - 3867.06] gross bonding agent in their
[3864.50 - 3868.98] anti-bonding agent in there so important
[3867.06 - 3872.22] to know I'm just saying I just wanted to
[3868.98 - 3873.78] kind of let you know that it's critical
[3872.22 - 3876.60] anyway it's wild blueberry powder right
[3873.78 - 3879.80] there from beveraging
[3876.60 - 3879.80] I'm mixing this up
[3883.80 - 3886.58] all right

[3999.12 - 4002.06] stuff they do that you can't get
[4000.74 - 4005.00] anywhere else

[4080.66 - 4085.22] mood yes it is
[4083.06 - 4086.78] all the way down to the fact that all
[4085.22 - 4088.94] the other powders have anti-caking
[4086.78 - 4090.56] agents in there and stuff and these
[4088.94 - 4092.54] don't like
[4090.56 - 4094.82] all the way to the thefting of medical

[4219.74 - 4224.98] for anybody who's a newbie
[4221.96 - 4224.98] Dr Nesbitt
[4226.94 - 4233.00] no no it's okay you can say that yeah
[4230.12 - 4234.92] Dr Elizabeth says that
[4233.00 - 4237.20] because he's a certified psychiatrist
[4234.92 - 4239.72] that he said that
[4237.20 - 4240.98] he will gladly treat
[4239.72 - 4242.96] because he's a board-certified
[4240.98 - 4246.58] psychiatrist he gladly treat anybody
[4242.96 - 4246.58] with any kind of mood problems
[4246.74 - 4251.84] if they're a chicken
[4249.32 - 4253.76] so Dr Nesbitt they have do they have to
[4251.84 - 4255.32] be a chicken for real
[4253.76 - 4257.12] Darkness but says they have to be a
[4255.32 - 4259.58] chicken but they're not chickens Dr
[4257.12 - 4262.42] Nesbit they're actually people
[4259.58 - 4262.42] they're humans
[4262.46 - 4266.02] he says what do you think I'm stupid
[4267.14 - 4270.44] he says I'm not stupid I know they're
[4269.06 - 4272.48] humans
[4270.44 - 4273.44] he says he does surgical procedures on
[4272.48 - 4275.84] humans
[4273.44 - 4277.76] all the time he works on humans he's not
[4275.84 - 4280.58] a chicken surgeon he's a human surgeon
[4277.76 - 4283.58] but he only does Psychiatry for chickens
[4280.58 - 4286.64] why I don't get it
[4283.58 - 4291.14] chickens have a lot of emotional wounds
[4286.64 - 4293.60] and a lot of soul wounds right
[4291.14 - 4296.00] yeah I can only imagine
[4293.60 - 4298.84] um Dr Nesbitt is just wants to say one
[4296.00 - 4298.84] thing to newbies
[4299.84 - 4305.44] he appreciates you guys coming around
[4302.30 - 4305.44] and being here
[4305.54 - 4310.10] Dr Nesbitt
[4308.12 - 4311.20] where's Beatrice
[4310.10 - 4315.02] doctor
[4311.20 - 4319.00] says Beatrice is on a vacation
[4315.02 - 4319.00] away from Dr Nesbitt
[4319.16 - 4322.34] all right well when is she going to come
[4320.78 - 4324.92] back
[4322.34 - 4326.72] said she may never come back
[4324.92 - 4328.52] she may not come back ever again she
[4326.72 - 4330.86] feels like she was humiliated and
[4328.52 - 4333.08] insulted
[4330.86 - 4335.30] um the last time she was here
[4333.08 - 4337.64] and she feels like she was not heard or
[4335.30 - 4339.56] validated because Dr Nesbitt is very
[4337.64 - 4343.30] dominating
[4339.56 - 4343.30] he was dominating a conversation
[4343.48 - 4350.18] says aw I am healing bipolar
[4347.60 - 4351.62] deal with and I deal with so much mood
[4350.18 - 4354.32] disturbances
[4351.62 - 4356.66] and this shot was better than any drug I
[4354.32 - 4358.34] feel a heck of a lot better right now I
[4356.66 - 4362.24] smile
[4358.34 - 4364.70] Goofy for no reason and it was amazing
[4362.24 - 4367.52] I can't wait to have it again soon Saint
[4364.70 - 4369.80] Sue's fantastic
[4367.52 - 4371.54] Dr Nesbitt said that if you were a
[4369.80 - 4373.70] chicken he would
[4371.54 - 4376.16] offer you a session
[4373.70 - 4379.94] for free Santa's
[4376.16 - 4381.68] which you are not a chicken Amy Peter
[4379.94 - 4384.70] says mood shifters are way better than
[4381.68 - 4384.70] mood stabilizers
[4384.92 - 4387.70] amazing
[4388.40 - 4391.12] well
[4391.46 - 4394.48] Dr Nesbitt
[4394.52 - 4399.08] you're upset because you didn't get
[4396.14 - 4401.06] offered one Dr Nesbitt is in a terrible
[4399.08 - 4403.04] mood today
[4401.06 - 4406.16] let me just make sure I can help out in
[4403.04 - 4407.76] some way Dr Nesbitt said that when he
[4406.16 - 4409.28] got to the office
[4407.76 - 4412.96] [Music]
[4409.28 - 4412.96] the anesthesiologist
[4413.42 - 4418.10] um
[4415.30 - 4421.04] was late and the patient
[4418.10 - 4423.44] was waiting for surgery for a very long
[4421.04 - 4425.96] time an anesthesiologist
[4423.44 - 4428.84] was not helpful and then the
[4425.96 - 4431.68] anesthesiologist gave the patient too
[4428.84 - 4431.68] much anesthesia
[4431.78 - 4435.32] Dr Smith
[4433.16 - 4436.94] and he said that the patient took three
[4435.32 - 4439.46] days to wake up
[4436.94 - 4441.26] after the surgery but the surgery was
[4439.46 - 4442.76] today that doesn't make any sense Dr
[4441.26 - 4445.40] Nesbitt says it doesn't matter if it
[4442.76 - 4447.44] makes sense he says that he's just
[4445.40 - 4450.50] telling me he had a bad day
[4447.44 - 4452.18] I just want to say
[4450.50 - 4455.66] and
[4452.18 - 4458.66] uh Michelle L we love you and

[4466.34 - 4470.60] Dr nesbitt's already drinking and he
[4469.16 - 4472.52] said that this
[4470.60 - 4476.02] smoothie is delicious
[4472.52 - 4476.02] recognize but it's not a smoothie
[4476.42 - 4480.26] Dr Elizabeth said this smoothie drink is
[4478.76 - 4482.12] amazing
[4480.26 - 4484.04] Darkness but it's not a smoothie it's
[4482.12 - 4486.26] the mood shifter
[4484.04 - 4488.30] what are you talking about
[4486.26 - 4490.82] Darkness but said
[4488.30 - 4492.44] good heavy metal detox smoothie this is
[4490.82 - 4494.06] not the heavy metal deep the problem is
[4492.44 - 4496.16] with Dr Nesbitt he really doesn't know
[4494.06 - 4497.96] the information really well he just
[4496.16 - 4500.54] knows of things that you know he's heard
[4497.96 - 4502.58] where's Peggy and Donnie he said Peggy
[4500.54 - 4504.74] and Donnie are out today they are at the
[4502.58 - 4508.04] park
[4504.74 - 4510.74] problem is with piggy is piggy tends to
[4508.04 - 4513.62] eat a lot and Donnie tends to throw up a
[4510.74 - 4515.66] lot and the between the both of them Dr
[4513.62 - 4518.06] Nesbit says they embarrass him wherever
