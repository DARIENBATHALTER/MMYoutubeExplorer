everything and have done that and

14
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:37,280
this is an opportunity here

15
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,360
it takes it to another level i can't

16
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,480

17
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,160
about this this is what i've been

18
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,840
working on

19
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,800
i can't tell you how many lost days of

20
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:50,239
sleep nights of sleep um 20-hour days

21
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,160
24-hour days 22-hour days even up until

22
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:54,239
this point today

23
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,840
all of that and

24
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,640
the two books are right here so i don't

25
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,719
know if you've seen these yet

26
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,480
but these are the manuscripts just so

27
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,879
you know you're not going to get

28
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,320
the book in a binder you're going to get

29
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,200
the book

30
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:11,439
in a book right so i just want to say

31
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,119
one thing too many things i'm gonna say

32
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,799
about these two books this is gonna

33
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,320
actually really cool

34
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,560
but

35
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,119
these are not little books

36
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,200
these are not gonna be little books

37
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:26,240
each book

38
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,240
is bigger than cleanse the heel so it's

39
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,840
bigger than this medical textbook right

40
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,840
here okay

41
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,680
each book is bigger than me so what

42
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,759
happened was

43
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,680
soc kept on giving me information giving

44
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,439
me information

45
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,680
because of how many people are falling

46
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:43,759
ill right now neurological problems just

47
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,200
overall everything including blood clots

48
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,200
i got everything in these books it's

49
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,360
unbelievable right and

50
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,159
so what happened was

51
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:55,439
the book got so big and so big and so

52
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:58,320
big that the publisher reached out to me

53
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:00,960
and said we can't print the book because

54
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,640
you can't put this book's well over a

55
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,159
thousand pages

56
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,000
this book's 14 100 1500 pages you can't

57
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,080
we can't do it it's not possible the

58
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,040
press can't do it

59
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:16,000
so we have to divide these into two

60
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,920
powerful life-changing books and that's

61
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,520
what we did

62
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:23,840

63
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:25,599

too excited okay i was working really

late and then i couldn't fall asleep

76
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,720
because

77
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,200
my mind was racing about everything i

78
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,040

cleanses

82
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,840
the one thing about the medical medium

83
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,720
information in books is it's not one

84
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,800
size fits all it never was

85
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,560
that's why that's a tactic used against

86
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,800
medical mean because

87
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,159
the colts out there right like the keto

88
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,480

everything they're all one size fits all

90
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,360
and

91
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:23,680
the medical medium books are not one

92
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,120
size fits all it's customizable so

93
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,640
everybody has an opportunity to heal

94
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,799
that's why the most people have healed

95
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,080
on medical medium information worldwide

96
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:33,360

00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,879
and of course the new garage of medical

104
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,599
things

105
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:59,439
the new barrage of what we're up against

106
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,200

right when you order both of these books

192
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:42,639
it's two different books when you order

193
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,639
both of them the price you see

194
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,039
is not going to be the price when the

195
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:50,000
book comes out

196
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:52,720
so when the book comes out and amazon is

197
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,400
going to adjust the price

198
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,160
so the price you see is going to be

199
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,280
lower it's not going to be the price you

200
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,840
see now

201
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:02,960
when the book gets shipped that's number

202
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:05,520
one number two okay you ordered it chris

203
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,280
amazing christy ordered it incredible

204
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,919
number two here's another important

205
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,120
piece of information to know

206
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,720
all right

207
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,039
so you're not gonna be charged on your

208
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,360
card if you order it right now you won't

209
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:19,280
be charged on your credit card this is

210
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,199
important people get confused and they

211
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,720
think well if i pre-order the book now

212
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:26,080
i'm just going to get charged no you're

213
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:28,160
not you don't get charged for the books

214
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,160
until it's shipped

215
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,759
that's when you get charged for it so

216
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,160
when you pre-order it you're not even

217
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,759
going to get charged on your card so if

218
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,120
you pre-order it now you won't be

219
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,520
charged

220
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,919
and then when it does ship

221
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:44,319
it'll be at a lower price

222
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:46,240
because amazon starts to take down the

223
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,080
price on the books on the medical medium

224
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,240
books right

225
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,680
so if you pre-order now

226
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,120
and you pre-ordered it at the price it

227
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,479
is you're not going to be paying that

228
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,240
price

229
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,680
when it comes down to when the book gets

230
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,520
shipped and you're not going to be

231
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,440
charged on your card until the book is

232
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,120
shipped so keep that in mind that's

233
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,879
really an important thing and tell other

234
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,800

00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,880
time

be so blown away when you get these

275
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:25,519
books you won't even believe it there's

276
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,440
not going to be a book out there in the

277
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,040
health world as it is that compares to

278
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,480
the medical medium other books right you

279
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,040
guys know that but

280
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,800
this is a level there's no doctor author

281
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,279
there's no health author that could ever

282
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,680
do what happened in these books no

283
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:42,720
i can confidently say that i can

284
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,760
confidently say this

285
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,160
because

286
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:48,320
when you open these books up when you

287
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,680
get these books

288
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,519
first of all

289
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,519
the books are bigger than cleanse to

290
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:55,920
heal each book is bigger than cleanse to

291
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,920
heal when you get the book

292
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,040
be prepared

293
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,720
okay

294
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,880
it's not like oh i can't wait to read

295
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,399
aw's book i'll read it all in one night

296
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,839
it's not going to happen

297
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,519
no one's going to be able to read the

298
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,440
book in one night

299
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:11,760
it's not going to be possible

300
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,760
every single line in the book has a

301
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,360
powerful piece of information that's

302
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,279
life-changing that science research

303
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,560
doesn't even know yet they'll be taking

304
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,560
the information like they do from the

305
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,480
medical meeting books you know how like

306
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:25,760
i published that the medical the medical

307
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,600
medium um book one i published how

308
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,839
multiple sclerosis was caused by

309
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,680
epstein-barr and now science seven years

310
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,600
later is acting like they discovered it

311
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,760
which they didn't

312
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,839
but the point is is these books are so

313
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,519
packed with leading forefront

314
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,279
information your mind is going to be

315
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,399
blown like blown and know why i know

316
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,399
that

317
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:46,480
you guys you know why i know that

318
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:49,120
because my mind was freaking blown when

319
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:52,160
i was receiving the information

320
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:55,040
my mind was so blown

321
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:57,360
the hard part about putting these books

322
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:59,040
together was i had to learn the

323
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,959
information

324
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,800
from spirit of compassion

325
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:05,120
santa is here healing good to see you

326
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,279
good to see you guys coming on i had to

327
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,959
learn the information from spirit of

328
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,920
compassion

329
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,839
and

330
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,079
because it was brand new to me

331
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:16,399
i thought i already knew enough about

332
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:18,320
toxic heavy metals i didn't even know

333
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,600
the half of it like

334
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,600
and

335
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,880
so what happened was i thought look i

336
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,640
thought i knew

337
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:27,040
about so much about all the different

338
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,800
conditions and symptoms right because

339
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,200
that's that being an expert in chronic

340
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:33,920
illness and and teaching doctors for 35

341
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:36,720
years i thought i knew so much but once

342
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:39,120
again i just got basically smacked in

343
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,120
the head

344
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,480
and

345
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,480
spirited compassion said are you ready

346
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,560
for this are you up for this task and

347
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,000
i'm like i don't know

348
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,079
and

349
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,079
when you open up these books and you

350
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:54,560
read them your mind's gonna be so blown

351
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:56,880
because mine was because i had to learn

352
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,800
this i still haven't learned it

353
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,639
i took the information as a messenger

354
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,680
and i put it in here

355
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:05,440
it's god-given life-saving information

356
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,839
and

357
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,240
i got the information down perfectly the

358
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:12,720
way it needed to be done

359
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,560
but i still have to read these over

360
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,279
and read these over

361
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:20,240
that's how mind-blowing it is just the

362
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:22,160
chapter on burnout is a whole thing all

363
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:25,320
on another level

364
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:27,839
the chapter on viral brain is a is

365
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:29,839

458
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:52,079
naming a few right there

459
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,320
that's how much is in here i'm just

460
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:56,000
covering just a few

461
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:59,120
i think basically what's going to happen

462
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,639
is anybody who gets these books

463
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,480
they're

464
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:03,759
they're going to know when they crack

465
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,600
them open

466
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:07,519
they're going to know like how is this

467
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,759
possible

468
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:13,040
how is this possible

469
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:14,959
i'm actually emotional about it because

470
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,480
really and

471
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:17,839
so i just want to say something which is

472
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,040
really interesting and this wasn't

473
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,040
planned

474
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:23,680
this wasn't planned i have no control

475
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:26,480
over the release date

476
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:28,320
i have no control over the day we choose

477
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,959
right now

478
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,480
to actually do this okay it's thrown

479
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:34,720
upon me

480
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,800
had to be done

481
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,560
and the numbers

482
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,639
of the day

483
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,320
the month and the year

484
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,480
equal a seven

485
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:47,199
on both today

486
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,320
and both the release day

487
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:51,279
and

488
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:53,199
i asked soc about that why because these

489
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:55,279
actually are for the light

490
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:57,120
to battle darkness of what we're up

491
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:59,040
against including darkness in the in the

492
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,560
health field in the alternative health

493
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,000
field there's so much of that in there

494
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,920
it's ridiculous because it's all about

495
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,600
other things it's not about someone

496
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,039
who's chronically ill and really about

497
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,799
getting them better and

498
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:11,360
i mean

499
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:14,319
that alone is really mind-blowing

500
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:17,280
both land on seven

501
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:18,799
both land on seven

502
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,559
so um

503
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:22,480
all right so let me just i don't know

504
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:24,880
crack one open for a second you guys got

505
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,640

508
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:32,720
but let me crack into the table of

509
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,080

510
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,919

00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,080
need a nap later on

515
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,280

when you get the book shipped it's going

528
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,600
to be lower i really believe it's going

529
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,400
to be lower it always is

530
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,840
and

531
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,720
you're not going to be charged on your

532
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:18,320

533
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,679

00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,559

543
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:39,760
what you know so great

544
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:42,000
all right

545
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,760
so i'm gonna brain saver right here okay

546
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,600
so i got a table of contents in front of

547
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:48,880
me right here

548
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:50,720
here's a little sticky note right

549
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,480
i always put those things i'm gonna

550
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,160
piles of those eventually

551
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,440
yeah so

552
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:58,240
all right

553
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:00,640
so part one is called your brain story

554
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,880
so it's a story about your brain what's

555
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,720
really happening which is really great

556
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,799
about what the brain needs and how if we

557
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,960
don't give what our brain what it needs

558
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:09,760
how we get in trouble

559
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,679
so

560
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:15,919
chapter one is called save your brain

561
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:18,240
but chapter two is static brain

562
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:20,400
static brain about how the electricity

563
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,320
in the brain gets affected by everything

564
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,640

00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,279
isn't the price that it's going to be

754
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,480
when the book is shipped to you it's

755
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:02,400
going to be less

756
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,520
it's going to be less than that

757
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,200
keep in mind you're not going to be

758
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,320
charged pre-order it and you're not

759
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,000
going to be charged you don't get

760
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:10,000
charged until it's shipped to you very

761
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
important to know so you can totally

762
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,159
pre-order it and it's even going to be

763
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,039
you know like a better price and the

764
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:16,640
price

765
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:18,159
that they have it on now is still

766
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,400
incredible because of what these books

767
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:22,880
are because it's so many books in one

768
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:25,279
you you it's just yeah

769
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:27,679
it's still a steal

770
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:29,760
natalia says i have never seen anyone

771
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:31,120
write and come out with two books at the

772
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:35,120
same time

773
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:37,919
it's the first of its kind yes and and

774
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:39,440
my publisher made me aware that it was

775
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:42,720
original and

776
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:44,880
then nobody does it

777
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:47,520
it's just that it's like this it's

778
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:49,760
chronic the chronic illness is rising on

779
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:51,600
a level no one even imagined in five

780
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:53,200
years from now people have no idea but

781
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,880
our systems are going to be basically

782
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,960
shutting down out there

783
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:59,279
meaning the way the world works because

784
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,159
there's too many sick people

785
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:02,480
if

786
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:04,720
i don't get this out to the ones that

787
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,640
can find it to to the ones that can find

788
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,640
it because they've been they've been

789
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,080
guided there somehow providentially

790
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,440
through the universe through like

791
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,120
through god and they've been they've

792
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:15,520
been guided through the angels and they

793
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:17,919
got to the books

794
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:19,200
and they got to the books

795
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:20,960
happy are they

796
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:24,880

797
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:27,679

00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,279
love you aw thank you for changing our

925
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:05,519
lives

926
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:08,399
i just scratched the surface you guys i

927
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:09,360
just scratched the surface on these

928
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:11,519
okay

929
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:13,760
they're both important to have it was

930
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:15,360
one book to start with it had to be

931
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:17,600
turned into two books they're bigger

932
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:20,320
than it would be a 12 pound book

933
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:22,000
if it was in one book it'd be a 10 to 12

934
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:23,600
pound book that wasn't going to work

935
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,360
when someone has chronic illness because

936
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,480
they can't be carrying around a 12 pound

937
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:29,200
book

938
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:31,279
it had to be cut into two books

939
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,679

00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,240
you guys once again if you pre-order it

1041
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:10,000

00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:12,240

right tick tock the link in the bio and

1044
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,520
link in the description here

1045
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,760
when you pre-order it you're not going

1046
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:19,680
to be charged for it until it's shipped

1047
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,960
to you so your card's not going to get

1048
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,960
the charge

1049
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,160
that's one number two is the price is

1050
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,200
going to drop by the time it gets

1051
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,560
shipped to you so it's going to get

1052
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,920
shipped to you at a different price a

1053
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,599
lower price

1054
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:32,320
keep that in mind

1055
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:33,839
when you pre-order these okay and just

1056
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:36,079
know that you guys i can't thank you

1057
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:38,720
enough for spreading the word telling

1058
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:41,440
people about it being so supportive

1059
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:43,680
right through thick and thin

1060
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,960
being supported through thick and thin

1061
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:47,119
right

1062
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:48,320
keep in mind the books sell out

1063
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:50,320
so that

1064
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:52,640
that it happens to all the medical media

1065
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:55,359
books that by the time if you don't get

1066
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:57,839
a pre-order in i'm not doing this to get

1067
00:36:55,359 --> 00:37:00,320
you you know like scared oh no what what

1068
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:01,920
it just happens every time so if i don't

1069
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:04,640
say something everybody gets mad at me

1070
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:06,320
because they wish they pre-ordered it

1071
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,680
and then when time gets shipped they run

1072
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:09,760
out and then they have to wait for

1073
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:12,720
another printing and that could take

1074
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:16,000
like a couple of months or a few months

1075
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:17,599
so pre-ordering does secure that you get

1076
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,280
a copy

1077
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:20,240
it does

1078
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,680
so

1079
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:24,320
and

1080
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:26,480
yeah and and it secures that you get a

1081
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:28,320
copy with everything going on too as the

1082
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:30,000
world is changing and everything and

1083
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,839
things are happening and things are

1084
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,320
harder to get not all that it's just

1085
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:36,320
it's good to know a copy is secure or

1086
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:38,160
copies

1087
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:40,320
