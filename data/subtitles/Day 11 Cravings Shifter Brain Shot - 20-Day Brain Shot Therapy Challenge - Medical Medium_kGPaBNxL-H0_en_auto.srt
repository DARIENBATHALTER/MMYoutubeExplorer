00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:57,000
brain saver just so you know I'm gonna

27
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,860
read a little bit which is kind of

28
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,620
exciting let's find the craving shifter

29
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:03,559
of what we're going to be working on

30
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:08,159
we're doing the craving shifter today

31
00:01:03,559 --> 00:01:09,659
mind blowing it is so powerful it is not

32
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,100
a joke man when you do that craving

33
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:15,720
shifter

34
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:17,460
that thing shuts down Cravings like it

35
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,460
just shuts them down it's really

36
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:22,860
incredible it's a miracle

37
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:25,500
I'm reading page 147 of the moderation

38
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:27,780
trap inside brain saver if you guys want

39
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:30,240

40
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:33,299

Wings smell really good right here

42
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:39,360
Heidi Inman said saving so much money

43
00:01:35,659 --> 00:01:41,939
not buying so you're not buying all the

44
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,180
chocolate and all the coffee because I

45
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:45,979
see some emojis there

46
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:49,380
all right

47
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:50,579
you guys know that why it's not good to

48
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:53,640
eat eggs right

49
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:55,740
you know vegans don't eat eggs

50
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,979
for the moment when they're 100 vegan

51
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:01,860
because they don't want to eat an animal

52
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:04,320
product but they don't know why eggs are

53
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:06,600
bad nobody knew why eggs were bad nobody

54
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,340
in any health realm vegan or anywhere

55
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,560
else eggs are bad because the medical

56
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,599
medium information about eggs feeding

57
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,459
pathogens inside the body dormant

58
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:18,000
shingles virus dormant Epstein-Barr

59
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:19,080
Dorman hhv6 dormant CMV all the

60
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,379
different viruses especially

61
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:25,620
Epstein-Barr feed on eggs we eat the

62
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:28,020
eggs the viruses feed on the eggs and

63
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:30,060
then release neurotoxins and the

64
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:32,160
neurotoxins give everybody symptoms

65
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:33,840
neurological symptoms which is all

66
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,360
medical medium information nobody knew

67
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,120
that either it's incredible really the

68
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,560
contribution of spirit of compassion to

69
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,700
the Alternative Health world and

70
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,620
conventional Health world with this

71
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:46,800
information that's why you don't eat

72
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:48,660
eggs it's not because of other reasons

73
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,400
like hey I'm vegan and I won't eat eggs

74
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:52,560
even though vegans go back to eating

75
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,180
eggs after they get sick eating vegan

76
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,340
because they're not doing vegan the

77
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:58,260
right way or whatever people just go

78
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:00,900

it's permission to do things that aren't

97
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:46,099
great for us

00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:51,540

it's permission to do things that aren't

102
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,260
great for us

103
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:04,019
right because that's what moderation is

104
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:05,940
moderation the whole concept the whole

105
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:07,799
understanding of it is to make sure we

106
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:10,680
have permission to do things that just

107
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:13,019
aren't good for us

108
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,640
our physical body does not like

109
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:17,639
moderation

110
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,979

I'm on page Jane I'm on page 147

116
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,540

00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:43,699
moderation I'm gonna eat this chocolate

119

cake in moderation

120
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:49,259
yet our body is governed by our

121
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:51,660
subconsciousness and Consciousness our

122
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:54,240
body is under the control of our

123
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:55,680
subconsciousness and Consciousness that

124
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,840
part of that piece right there is just

125
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:01,560
incredible when you think about it our

126
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:04,500
body is under the control

127
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:05,940
of our subconsciousness and

128
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:10,500
consciousness

129
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:14,120
that means if our Consciousness wants to

130
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:17,759
eat in moderation or party in moderation

131
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:20,880
then our body has to shut up

132
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:22,919
sit down and take it

133
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,240
that's what our body has to do

134
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:26,280
if our Consciousness and

135
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,740
subconsciousness wants to partake in

136
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:32,340
moderation in any way it wants to

137
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:35,220
partake in any kind of moderation

138
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:39,300
whether it's wreck drugs

139
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:41,220
prescription Pharmaceuticals whatever or

140
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:43,740
Pizza

141
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:45,120
chocolate cake whatever cacao

142
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:47,900
our body

143
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:51,780
has to just be like

144
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:55,259
gotta do it got no choice

145
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:58,160
your body has to shut up

146
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:58,160
and take it

147
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:03,180
so our body is governed by our

148
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:05,759
subconsciousness and Consciousness our

149
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:08,520
mind which can be injured or persuaded

150
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:11,419
to want something our physical body

151
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,419
doesn't want

152
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,220
our Free Will is part of how we step

153
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:19,860
outside the box in life we use our free

154
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:22,259
will to step out of the box

155
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:24,600
it's how we embark on trying to heal

156
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:26,699
when we aren't being given any true

157
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,680
answers so we don't have any answers go

158
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:31,039
to the doctor we're sick we have no

159
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,039
answers

160
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,759
we go to a functional doctor and he says

161
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:37,560
oh stay away from processed foods

162
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,300
you do it you stay away from processed

163
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,919
foods and you're still sick

164
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:43,259
don't know why but you're still sick and

165
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:45,840
don't have an answer

166
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:48,060
and because of that our Free Will has

167
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,199
this desire to be like we we use our

168
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:51,240
free will

169
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,759
our soul has this desire to get a free

170
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,919
will to be like we need help we need

171
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:59,000
help we need answers I don't want to be

172
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,000
sick I need answers

173
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:03,600
we can make two kinds of mistakes I'm

174
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:05,220
interested in reading that I want to

175
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:09,000
know what these mistakes are

176
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:12,180
hm sounds 88 says yes what is wrong with

177
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,060
cacao just really kills the adrenals it

178
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:15,900
gives women hard

179
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:19,199
childbirths like

180
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:21,740
it because you're adrenals

181
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:25,680
get clobbered when you're doing cacao

182
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:28,080
clobbered so you're using them like a

183
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,240
credit card you're using them you're

184
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,460
using all your credit card power out of

185
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,720
your adrenals so if you're if you're

186
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:36,120
someone that's dealing with adrenal

187
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,259
fatigue or any kind of adrenal issues

188
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,840
you don't even know you're dealing with

189
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:41,699
or kidney issues on any level that you

190
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,800
don't even know you're dealing with

191
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:46,199
or brain problems you don't know you're

192
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:49,139
dealing with like nervous system issues

193
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:50,819
cacao kills your nervous system because

194
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:52,440
it jacks up the adrenaline the

195
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:54,539
adrenaline floods into the brain and

196
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:56,520
destroys nerve sheaths because

197
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:58,979
adrenaline's so corrosis it's like

198
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:01,440
corrosive you're taking adrenaline that

199
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:03,000
you shouldn't be using you're creating a

200
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,199
stimulation you're not supposed to be

201
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
creating

202
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:09,419
so it's a drug

203
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,639
it's a cacao really prevents healing

204
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:14,039
okay fine if you're not so sick and we

205
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:15,960
just did a big talk about people who are

206
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:18,180
not so sick they can play in any land

207
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:20,280
they want I'm going to eat a whole

208
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:23,819
ton of eggs I'm gonna eat all the cacao

209
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:25,500
I want I could do what I want right when

210
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:27,900
you're not so sick but when you get

211
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:30,300
really sick and the scale tips

212
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:32,820
and you start doing that cacao you you

213
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:35,399
can't heal the chocolate industry the

214
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:38,159
caffeine industry has has a lot of money

215
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:40,140
behind it they will tell you that it has

216
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:42,000
antioxidants and Cacao is good for you

217
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:43,740
and caffeine products are good for you

218
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,580
but they're not

219
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:49,800
and they really really rip apart the

220
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:52,620
nervous system they damage the brain

221
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:56,640
over time and they they cause the

222
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:59,160
adrenals to just flood what the cacao

223
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:01,080
does for women is it makes it so many

224
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:03,660
women have to have a C-section when they

225
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:06,360
weren't planning on a C-section

226
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:10,320
that's what cacao can do years of cacao

227
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:12,180
and chocolate coffee right all of it

228
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,980
they have think tanks that are designed

229
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:16,800
to really keep people addicted for a

230
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:18,779
lifetime so the caffeine industry

231
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,820
has think tanks that are designed to

232
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:22,200
make sure that you stay on caffeine for

233
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:24,300
the rest of your life and that your baby

234
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:27,980
becomes addicted to caffeine and all

235
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:27,980
that carries it on carries it up

236
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,339
we can make two kinds of mistakes I'm

237
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:34,200
reading page 147 in brain saver these

238
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:37,620
are incredible books that protocols

239
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:41,000
right friend saver protocols

240
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:41,000
anybody who's interested

241
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:46,800
we can make two kinds of mistakes in the

242
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:49,680
first kind of mistake we can have a test

243
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:54,080
in front of us in school and get several

244
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:54,080
true true or false questions wrong

245
00:09:55,560 --> 00:10:00,480
we can make a mistake crossing our T's

246
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:04,980
and dotting our eyes

247
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:07,500
we can make a mathematical mistake

248
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:09,420
in this type of mistake there's no free

249
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:13,860
will

250
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:16,680
or rather not your free will

251
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:19,800
the Free Will behind that test was the

252
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:21,480
Free Will of an institution or the

253
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:26,220
person who designed it

254
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:29,720
so you're in school and you take a test

255
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:29,720
you're not using your free will

256
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,459
it's an institution

257
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:38,480
that's making you take that test

258
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:38,480
the institution

259
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:43,080
is in control of your free will you

260
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:45,120
don't have free will

261
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:47,820
you take you're taking the test in

262
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:50,600
school because an institution has you

263
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,600
taking that test

264
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:57,180
Free Will behind that test was not the

265
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,279
free will

266
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:01,860
of your own

267
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:03,839
it was an institution

268
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:05,640
or the person who designed it so the

269
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:08,220
person who designed your test in school

270
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:11,399
your mathematic medical test or whatever

271
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:12,600
remember I'm not a college grad I never

272
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:14,040
went to college

273
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,140
whatever

274
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:19,019
the point is

275
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:21,240
the point is is that

276
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:22,680
if you go to school which is fine I want

277
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,899
people to go to school I want them to go

278
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:26,640
to college I want them to do

279
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:28,260
what's right for them of course right

280
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,060
not telling people don't go to school

281
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:32,760
it's just that we don't use our free

282
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:34,860
will when we're in school

283
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:36,720
our Free Will is taken over by an

284
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:39,140
institution or a person who designed

285
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,140
that test

286
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:46,079
we only used our free will when we

287
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:50,220
decided to sit down

288
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:53,040
this so you walked into class and you

289
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:54,600
sat down that's your when you use your

290
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,720
free will

291
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:59,820
and when you filled out the test

292
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:02,399
and you tried to answer questions that

293
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:04,440
was your free will

294
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:07,019
then we can make mistakes that affect

295
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:10,140
our soul mistakes through decision

296
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:13,019
processes using our conscious mind that

297
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:14,640
aren't about exact calculations so

298
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:16,860
there's one form of mistake you make

299
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:20,519
where you fill out the wrong

300
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:24,740
answer on your test in school that's a

301
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:24,740
mistake you made you made a mistake

302
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:31,380
but there's other mistakes mistakes that

303
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:33,779
decision processing happened where you

304
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:36,360
used your Consciousness it's not about

305
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:37,560
exact calculations formulations or word

306
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:39,660
choices

307
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:42,060
we can make mistakes that are outside

308
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:44,940
the realm of punching numbers and

309
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:47,880
answering questions that we've studied

310
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:50,399
and prepared for and memorized

311
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:52,800
so when you study for a test you can

312
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:55,500
still make a mistake oh

313
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,540
I remembered the answer I can't remember

314
00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:00,000
it right now so I'm going to choose this

315
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:02,660
little spot I'll check this box and oh I

316
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,660
made a mistake

317
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:08,480
but there's another form of mistake we

318
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:08,480
make with our consciousness

319
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:13,200
while making these other kinds of

320
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,700
decisions our soul can be impacted these

321
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:18,120
are the mistakes we make with our own

322
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:22,579
free will so what I'm trying to say is

323
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:22,579
we can make mistakes in moderation

324
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:27,839
that hinder Us in other ways

325
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:29,459
Health with Liz said this is

326
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:32,220
mind-blowing that's why I didn't

327
00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:35,720
continue using my free will now to

328
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:35,720
create myself it's incredible

329
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,839
when we're sick

330
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:44,519
the diagnostic testing process is

331
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:47,899
similar to being in school

332
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:47,899
you guys follow me on that

333
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:54,000
when we are sick the diagnostic testing

334
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:56,639
process when we're sick is similar to

335
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:00,240
being in school here's a physical test

336
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:03,959
that the doctor prescribed

337
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:06,800
here's a drug that the doctor prescribed

338
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:06,800
it's kind of like school

339
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:14,880
here's another test here's another drug

340
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:17,639
we use our free will only

341
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:19,079
to try all these tests and these

342
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:22,440
treatments

343
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:26,040
we're using our free will to do the test

344
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:28,860
and try the drug

345
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:32,700
just like we use our free will to sit

346
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:36,360
down and take a test in school

347
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:38,519
we go through the MRIS

348
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:40,440
the CAT scans

349
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:42,600
the blood panels

350
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:45,839
and more

351
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:47,339
we're still not better

352
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:49,560
a lot of people that go through all that

353
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:51,540
and they're not better yet right

354
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:53,760
that leaves us in the realm of not

355
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:55,199
finding answers how many people have

356
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:58,579
gone through

357
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,579
a battery of tests

358
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:05,600
taking a battery of drugs

359
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:05,600
and they're not better

360
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:10,380
it leads them to search for answers

361
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:12,540
correct

362
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:15,660
we find ourselves sitting at home one

363
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:19,680
night telling ourselves we really need

364
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:21,540
to heal we have to find an answer

365
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,940
how many people have been left sitting

366
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:26,100
home at night

367
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:27,600
after they tried a battery test in a

368
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,279
battery of drugs

369
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,380
and a battery of doctors and they're

370
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:34,620
sitting home at night

371
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:36,959
and they see to themselves

372
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:39,300
I have to get out of this

373
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:43,040
I have to find a way

374
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:43,040
I have to find an answer

375
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,459
I have to heal

376
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:52,620
now we have to use our free will like

377
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:54,360
never before to find answers for our

378
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:55,260
physical body you see where I'm going

379
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,060
here

380
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:59,279
anyone who found medical medium

381
00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:01,920
information

382
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:03,959
they went above and beyond using their

383
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:07,380
free will

384
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:10,220
they really ignited their free will to

385
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:10,220
find an answer

386
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:17,699
now we have to use our free will like

387
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:20,579
never before to find answers for our

388
00:16:17,699 --> 00:16:21,959
physical body it's not about black and

389
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:24,680
white

390
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:24,680
we discover

391
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:30,540
it's about taking a it's not about

392
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:34,019
taking a test

393
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:36,000
in an institution on a memorized set of

394
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:38,940
answers

395
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,320
it's not about being indoctrinated to a

396
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:44,839
place

397
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,839
all our egos oh sorry

398
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:50,100
must be the ego shifter I'm still

399
00:16:47,459 --> 00:16:52,680
remembering there it's not about being

400
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:54,000
indoctrinated to place all our eggs in

401
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:57,060
their basket

402
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,139
instead finding Health answers becomes a

403
00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:00,480
journey

404
00:16:58,139 --> 00:17:03,660
when I think about this getting a little

405
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:05,600
bit a little bit emotional right now in

406
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:09,299
this moment because I'm getting

407
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:11,220
flashbacks over and over again of how

408
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:12,839
many people I've seen throughout the

409
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:15,299
years

410
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:16,439
and how many people that are out there

411
00:17:15,299 --> 00:17:19,199
now

412
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:21,839
they're searching for answers

413
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:24,059
their free will only went as far

414
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:25,980
as sitting down and taking getting

415
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:28,199
through a battery of tests and doing a

416
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:29,640
battery of drugs but then they found I'm

417
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:32,720
not better yet

418
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,720
I need to do more

419
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:39,000
l r Rose says I can relate and then they

420
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:40,860
sat down

421
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,500
one night

422
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:45,240
maybe in their Darkest Hour

423
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,500
and they thought about all the symptoms

424
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,600
they have

425
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:50,039
and how they've tried everything they

426
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:52,559
can think of

427
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:54,660
and they're stuck

428
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:56,640
spiritual path to true love says all

429
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:58,919
those tests really had me fooled that

430
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:02,539
they knew what they were doing so glad

431
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:02,539
you told us what's really going on

432
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:09,360
it's a powerful uh comment by the way

433
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:11,340
that means you're experienced that means

434
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:14,299
you've seen how things are you know

435
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,299
what's going on out there

436
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:23,700
so what I'm what I'm reading to you guys

437
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:26,720
right now is I'm talking about how

438
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,720
our free will

439
00:18:27,299 --> 00:18:31,260
really ignites and takes off when we're

440
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:34,919
in that dark hour

441
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:37,700
and we've used our Free Will instead for

442
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:37,700
the institutions

443
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:41,700
and then all of a sudden

444
00:18:39,539 --> 00:18:43,320
there's this moment in time where like I

445
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:46,020
need an answer

446
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:49,140
I need to heal I need to find something

447
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:50,760
and that's when your Consciousness and

448
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:53,520
subconsciousness

449
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:55,320
really

450
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,660
hunker down

451
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,740
attach itself to the Free Will that you

452
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:02,660
have

453
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:02,660
and then you search for something else

454
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:09,419
now you're not putting all your eggs in

455
00:19:06,539 --> 00:19:12,960
the institutions basket

456
00:19:09,419 --> 00:19:14,940
instead you're finding Health answers it

457
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,820
becomes a journey

458
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:19,740
kind of like when we're looking for love

459
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:21,840
we're lonely

460
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:23,220
we want a partner to share our lives

461
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:26,580
with

462
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:29,280
and there can almost be a desperation

463
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:32,400
of our Consciousness in some situations

464
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:34,919
that brings the soul into a different

465
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:37,679
Realm

466
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:40,140
just like in the search for love when we

467
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:42,000
reach when we reach this point in our

468
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:44,220
search for healing

469
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,980
it's not about what looks perfect on

470
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:48,419
paper anymore or even what makes sense

471
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:52,400
anymore

472
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:52,400
we end up taking risks

473
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:59,160
that's where the soul has no choice but

474
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:02,160
to go along for the ride with whatever

475
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:05,160
we're being pushed into and whatever our

476
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:07,679
Consciousness is pushing our soul into

477
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:10,380
even if it's not the best for our soul

478
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:13,919
and physical brain and body this is

479
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:16,559
where we can make mistakes

480
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:19,140
if our Consciousness is peer pressured

481
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:21,600
convinced persuaded or conditioned into

482
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:23,580
using information or practices that

483
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:27,059
don't align with healing or that even

484
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:29,660
interfere with healing I'm on page 148 a

485
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,660
brain saver

486
00:20:30,419 --> 00:20:35,520
you know when I read that what do I

487
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:38,600
understand

488
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:41,460
this means that after we leave that

489
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:44,400
institutional understanding

490
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:46,440
you go through a battery of tests

491
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,820
you do a battery of drugs

492
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:49,500
you're stuck

493
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:51,480
and now

494
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:53,280
you go on a journey

495
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,059
you use your free will and go on a

496
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,580
journey

497
00:20:54,059 --> 00:20:58,200
but we can still make mistakes using our

498
00:20:56,580 --> 00:21:01,080
free will on a journey but we're still

499
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:03,240
we still have to search

500
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:05,460
we may search for love

501
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:06,960
it may not work out

502
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:08,460
but we

503
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,220
need it

504
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:13,860
to find somebody else

505
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:16,140
and maybe it did work out

506
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:17,940
or searching for health answers

507
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:19,260
we take a whole bunch of stuff that

508
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:21,120
isn't good and eat a whole bunch of

509
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:24,179
cacao and we do all this other stuff

510
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:27,000
whatever I'm just saying

511
00:21:24,179 --> 00:21:29,100
and we don't get what we need

512
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,720
but then we stumble across something we

513
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:32,720
do find and it works out

514
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,840
foreign

515
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,120
spiritual said it made many many

516
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:41,580
mistakes because of that

517
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:44,419

518
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:48,539

section out you guys this is incredible

531
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:26,220
page 148 a brain saver

532
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:29,580
moderation

533
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:32,880
is one of those practices

534
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:34,679
there's nothing wrong with having that

535
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,059
I'm not saying

536
00:22:34,679 --> 00:22:37,440
I tell people they can eat what they

537
00:22:36,059 --> 00:22:38,880
want they can eat pizzas they could eat

538
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,620
this and this but just try to do some

539
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:43,260
medical medium Tools in between it all

540
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:44,880
try to get started somehow start with 16

541
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:47,640
ounces of celery juice on an empty

542
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:49,140
stomach I don't tell people if they have

543
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:51,059
to give up everything in their life

544
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:53,159
that's not it it depends how sick they

545
00:22:51,059 --> 00:22:55,020
are and what they need accomplished how

546
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:56,820
they need to heal how far they need to

547
00:22:55,020 --> 00:23:00,299
go someone's really sick they're

548
00:22:56,820 --> 00:23:03,299
bedridden they're on mattress Island

549
00:23:00,299 --> 00:23:06,299
there's a way out and it may be where

550
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:08,340
we're not doing certain things to get

551
00:23:06,299 --> 00:23:10,140
out of that

552
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:12,120
moderation is one of those practices

553
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:14,520
I've always said start bringing in the

554
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:16,919
good and crowd out the bad that's the

555
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:20,700
medical medium talk for years now

556
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:24,140
decades bring in the good slowly and

557
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:24,140
it'll crowd out the bad

558
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:28,799
moderation is one of those practices

559
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:31,980
there's nothing wrong with having that

560
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:34,320
you should have what you want

561
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:37,020
you need to balance it

562
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:41,039
we're told that if we only engage in

563
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:43,020
reasonable amounts questionable Foods

564
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:45,179
and certain practices such as micro

565
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:46,320
dosing caffeine and even alcohol could

566
00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:50,400
benefit us

567
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:51,900
if it's in small reasonable dosages it

568
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,799
could benefit you that's what we're

569
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:55,919
taught

570
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:59,480
so we give them a try and we end up set

571
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:02,220
back even more in our healing

572
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:05,539
absolutely so many people are set back

573
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:05,539
in their healing constantly

574
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:11,100
whether we know it or not we're set back

575
00:24:09,419 --> 00:24:13,140
in our healing

576
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:15,000
because our conditioning is so strong

577
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:18,360
that's what happens on planet Earth

578
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:21,240
we're up against an immense amount of

579
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:23,159
conditioning here and brainwashing

580
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:26,100
we blame ourselves for these practices

581
00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:28,919
not working out instead of blaming the

582
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:32,640
substances themselves

583
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:35,240
we don't know how to blame the

584
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,240
substances

585
00:24:36,179 --> 00:24:41,280
we're conditioned to think the

586
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:43,880
substances are fine like cacao

587
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,880
coffee

588
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:48,720
so many other things

589
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:51,179
and this isn't just the cacao and coffee

590
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,520
thing I'm talking about those two little

591
00:24:51,179 --> 00:24:55,380
examples

592
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:57,419
because of our conditioning is so strong

593
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:59,460
we blame ourselves for those for these

594
00:24:57,419 --> 00:25:02,220
practices not working out instead of

595
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:04,799
blaming the substances themselves we may

596
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:08,159
even become so attached that we guard

597
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:10,679
these practices with our lives

598
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:12,419
Kombucha tea can turn your blood into

599
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:17,400
acid

600
00:25:12,419 --> 00:25:20,520
mm info for over 30 years now out there

601
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:23,460
it literally can turn the blood into a

602
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:25,559
straight acidosis condition

603
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:29,960
but people love their Kombucha Tea it's

604
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:29,960
most Kombucha tea has caffeine in it

605
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:40,200
we've been pushed so often into finding

606
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:43,559
fault with ourselves with their brains

607
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:46,440
and bodies that we self-blame ourselves

608
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:51,320
and it becomes our default setting it's

609
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:51,320
my fault it's my fault it's my problem

610
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:58,799
I'm the blame my body's faulty I caused

611
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:01,020
the problem I'm why I'm sick I'm why I'm

612
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:03,900
mental I have a problem because of me

613
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:07,380
it's me it's me it's my fault

614
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:10,620
it's not the conditioning out there

615
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:12,659
yes it is it's not the brainwashing out

616
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:14,760
there yes it is

617
00:26:12,659 --> 00:26:16,860
it's not all the traps out there yes it

618
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:19,440
is the traps out there people just blame

619
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:23,299
themselves it's got to be me I'm faulty

620
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,299
I'm broken down I'm a bad person

621
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:29,100
Warehouse one says my health crashed in

622
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:32,700
early 2020.

623
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:35,340
lived with an ostomy bag 10 months

624
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:38,220
they had no answer I asked what caused

625
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:40,080
my colon disease they had no answer two

626
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:41,580
years on medical media my life is better

627
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,740
than ever now

628
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:47,419
Warehouse one on YouTube thank you for

629
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:47,419
leaving that comment bless your heart

630
00:26:51,059 --> 00:26:57,539
moderation cannot be defined

631
00:26:54,600 --> 00:27:00,380
even though you'll see a definition of

632
00:26:57,539 --> 00:27:00,380
the word moderation

633
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:07,860
if you look it up in the dictionary

634
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:12,480
we should see it as undefinable

635
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:15,120
because moderation is not measurable

636
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:18,020
it's a ruleless definition because it's

637
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,020
different for everyone

638
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:23,240
isn't that interesting moderation can't

639
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:23,240
be defined

640
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,140
that's incredible

641
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:31,380
number one Spirit of compassion gave me

642
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:33,600
those words and I wrote them as I heard

643
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:35,580
them

644
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,960
I was kind of blown away because I

645
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:39,600
didn't think about that what do you mean

646
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,640
moderation the definition can't like you

647
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:44,779
can't have a definition for moderation

648
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:44,779
how's that possible

649
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:50,220
I cover kombucha and brain saver

650
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:52,820
protocols for those that are asking if

651
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:55,980
kombucha is actually healthier enough

652
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:58,260
I would love to do a Kombucha Tea

653
00:27:55,980 --> 00:28:00,240
episode I would love to do a Kombucha

654
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:02,159
Tea podcast right now and I would love

655
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:05,840
to talk about it but we've got to talk

656
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:05,840
about moderation for a little bit

657
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:11,100
this is mind-blowing right here is it

658
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:13,140
just me

659
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:14,820
no I know you guys think this is cool

660
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:18,659
too right the info

661
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:20,520
moderation cannot be defined what

662
00:28:18,659 --> 00:28:22,140
even though you'll see a definition of

663
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:25,320
the word moderation if you look it up in

664
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:27,960
the dictionary it still can't be defined

665
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:31,080
we should see it as undefinable because

666
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:33,960
moderation is not measurable

667
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:36,240
it's a ruleless definition because it's

668
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:37,559
different for everyone

669
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,900
foreign

670
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:42,600
each individual's limitations are

671
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:44,520
different one person's moderation can

672
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:47,340
kill another person

673
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:50,220
see why it's not definable

674
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:52,580
one person's moderation can kill another

675
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:52,580
person

676
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:00,179
someone else is drinking in moderation

677
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:03,500
can kill another person

678
00:29:00,179 --> 00:29:03,500
who can't drink like that

679
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:08,159
that's true whether we're talking about

680
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:09,840
alcohol psychedelics or even food even

681
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:12,360
food

682
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:14,580
someone who's allergic to nuts could die

683
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:16,860
from someone else's level of nuts in

684
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:19,320
moderation someone else could have a nut

685
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:21,360
allergy but still be able to eat nuts in

686
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:23,940
moderation another person with a nut

687
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:25,620
allergy can't even eat a speck of nut in

688
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:27,419
moderation

689
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:32,419
it'll kill them

690
00:29:27,419 --> 00:29:32,419
it can't be defined it's not measurable

691
00:29:33,179 --> 00:29:39,860
when sort of compassion told me that and

692
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:39,860
I put it in here what's this like what

693
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:45,419
we hear moderation talked about a lot

694
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:47,279
with food choosing to eat a food in

695
00:29:45,419 --> 00:29:49,860
moderation is born out of knowing

696
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:53,039
somewhere deep inside that the food

697
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:56,520
you're choosing may not be safe to eat a

698
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:59,600
lot of or to eat constantly is that true

699
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:59,600
like is that true

700
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:06,720
I hear moderation all the time out there

701
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:08,880
I hear people talk about it all the time

702
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:11,220
I'm eating in moderation I'm doing what

703
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:13,320
I want in moderation do you guys hear it

704
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:15,000
out there choosing to eat of food in

705
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:16,500
moderation is born out of knowing

706
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,980
somewhere deep inside deep inside

707
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,980
everybody

708
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,620
that it may not be a good thing to eat

709
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:25,200
too much of

710
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:26,840
instinctually you may feel that way I'm

711
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:30,419
just gonna have a slice of that

712
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:32,940
pepperoni sausage pizza

713
00:30:30,419 --> 00:30:34,380
I gotta be I gotta just do moderation

714
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:36,539
right now and I only have to have to

715
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:38,159
slice of that because deep inside I know

716
00:30:36,539 --> 00:30:40,700
I'm not supposed to be tanking one of

717
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:40,700
these every night

718
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:47,580
Ros Angela says lived way too many years

719
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:50,580
feeling like I was inadequate as a woman

720
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:53,820
since age 10 being made to believe my

721
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:56,100
body was flawed out and I'd never get

722
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:57,000
better thank God I found you three years

723
00:30:56,100 --> 00:31:00,059
ago

724
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:02,520
thank you for being here truly vegan

725
00:31:00,059 --> 00:31:05,100
mommy V's life

726
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:07,559
all the books are truly amazing with

727
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:09,600
life-changing information I must say I'm

728
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:12,120
really loving the brain saver books

729
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:14,399
though I've learned so much I feel like

730
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:16,200
the brain saver books are the best books

731
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:18,720
ever

732
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:21,659
ever out of all time I mean in history

733
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:24,240
of Health when you crack into these

734
00:31:21,659 --> 00:31:27,860
the information is just

735
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,860
so mind-blowing so incredible

736
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:34,140
I mean all the medical meaning books

737
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:35,039
so we're talking about moderation right

738
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:38,580
now

739
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:40,860
deep inside of us innately

740
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:42,960
we're using the term moderation because

741
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:45,000
we know that we have to be careful and

742
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:49,039
that what we're eating might not be good

743
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,039
and what we're doing might not be good

744
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:53,820
we use the term moderation to give

745
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:56,279
ourselves permission to consume that

746
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:58,380
food something inside us knows we're not

747
00:31:56,279 --> 00:31:59,880
supposed to be eating fried greasy food

748
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:02,760
every day

749
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:04,559
is there something inside of you that

750
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:07,799
tells you you should probably not be

751
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:09,980
eating fried greasy food every single

752
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:09,980
day

753
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:14,220
because I talk about moderation all

754
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:16,980
these years

755
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:18,779
I've had a lot of people both like

756
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:20,640
outside of the communities and every now

757
00:32:18,779 --> 00:32:22,559
and then someone inside the community it

758
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:25,020
just doesn't like

759
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:26,580
you know doesn't like doing their celery

760
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:29,000
juice doesn't like whatever and they'll

761
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:29,000
be like

762
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:36,740
he's he's anti-moderation moderation is

763
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:36,740
is the best thing in life

764
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:40,799
are we

765
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:43,320
foreign

766
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:45,899
are we okay to eat cakes and cookies and

767
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:48,179
donuts all day long

768
00:32:45,899 --> 00:32:50,940
we know it's not good

769
00:32:48,179 --> 00:32:53,840
so maybe we'll just have one cake one

770
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:53,840
cookie one donut

771
00:32:55,399 --> 00:33:00,600
see Rising Phoenix said it would be very

772
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:02,899
very very helpful to hear more about

773
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:06,779
what is helpful for the normal person

774
00:33:02,899 --> 00:33:08,940
and not everything but grass and celery

775
00:33:06,779 --> 00:33:10,679
are acceptable to eat

776
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:11,580
what's really interesting about that

777
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:13,500
comment

778
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:17,159
Rising Phoenix

Apple podcast so you know like what I

802
00:34:08,339 --> 00:34:11,520
talk about because it's not about just

grass and celery

804
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:15,419
that's not here so I don't know where

805
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:17,460
that information came from I don't know

806
00:34:15,419 --> 00:34:18,960
if someone said that out there you must

807
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:21,119
not be reading the books or this or

808
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,919
hearing the podcasts or seeing

809
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:24,659
everything on social media with all the

810
00:34:22,919 --> 00:34:26,339
amazing foods and the recipes and the

811
00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:28,080
herbs and the wild foods and you can eat

812
00:34:26,339 --> 00:34:31,139
meat if you want you can be plant-based

813
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:34,560
if you want that's how incredibly vast

814
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:37,260
it is so I just want you to know Rising

815
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:42,139
Phoenix that it's not just grass and

816
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:44,700
celery and it's it's so much the recipes

817
00:34:42,139 --> 00:34:46,200
you can be eating all the potatoes you

818
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:48,599
want you can do whatever you can be

819
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:50,639
plant-based you could be animal protein

820
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:52,500
it's really there's a tremendous amount

821
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:54,659
of information so I wonder if someone

822
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:56,520
just said something to you and

823
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:58,260
and you just didn't know

824
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:00,920
but thank you for being here and thank

825
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:00,920
you for that comment

826
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:08,339
see we learn along the way that it's not

827
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:10,859
the best choice and could lead to some

828
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:12,960
kind of Health complication if we want

829
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:14,820
to just go crazy and eat donuts every

830
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,500
day all day long we know that

831
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:19,920
something's going to go wrong we can

832
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:22,680
sense it we can feel it we know it

833
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:25,560
moderation is permission to self-indulge

834
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:28,740
or self-sabotage so it's a permission to

835
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:31,260
self-sabotage when you hear hey I can do

836
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:33,060
it in moderation we're actually giving

837
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:35,640
ourselves permission or someone's giving

838
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:36,660
us permission that moderation is totally

839
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:39,720
fine

840
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:40,800
and maybe it is fine if you've never

841
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:43,560
been sick

842
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:45,960
and you're not sick and you want to play

843
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:48,180
reindeer games and you want to partake

844
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:49,980
in whatever maybe it is fine if that's

845
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:51,240
what you want to do but if you're sick

846
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:52,859
and you're struggling you've got the

847
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:55,440
migraines and the aches and pains and

848
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:57,680
the jaw pain the back pain and you've

849
00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:00,119

857
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:22,859
maytal said on YouTube I question a lot

858
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,660
of the foods my health nutritionist says

859
00:36:22,859 --> 00:36:28,380
for my sibo

860
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:31,079
no pears and apples but cookies and one

861
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:32,620
serving of alcohol okay

862
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:35,750
are you trying to make me laugh

863
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:35,750
[Music]

864
00:36:36,359 --> 00:36:40,440
Hall

865
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:43,440
are you trying to cheer me up and make

866
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:44,640
me laugh or something give me a giggle I

867
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:49,260
don't agree

868
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:50,760
the FODMAP list is very outdated

869
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:53,160
first of all

870
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:56,040
FODMAP or any place else

871
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:57,780
they were always outdated mm info was

872
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:59,760
always far advanced

873
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:02,099
but now they're actually taking medical

874
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:04,260
medium information

875
00:37:02,099 --> 00:37:07,500
and they're incorporating them in all to

876
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:09,300
those outdated programs and diet belief

877
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:10,859
systems they're just stealing and

878
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:12,619
poaching so much mm info and they're

879
00:37:10,859 --> 00:37:15,000
plugging it into all those outdated

880
00:37:12,619 --> 00:37:16,680
there was all those outdated crappy

881
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,540
belief systems that never got people

882
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:21,500
better when they were sick anyway you

883
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:21,500
made me laugh right there

884
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:26,820
okay

885
00:37:24,359 --> 00:37:28,500
a little bit of alcohol is fine don't

886
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:30,960
eat a pear

887
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:33,260
don't eat an apple but you can have a

888
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,260
cookie

889
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,280
oh man

890
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:42,540
I'm cracking up over here

891
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:44,040
drinking in moderation is also a term

892
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:46,200
though often here that's because they

893
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:47,400
were allowing drinking in moderation we

894
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:50,160
happen to be talking about that right

895
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:51,960
there maybe you even use the term

896
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:54,320
drinking in moderation I'm drinking in

897
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:57,240
moderation

898
00:37:54,320 --> 00:38:00,240
you guys want to come over my house

899
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:02,099
later have some drinks

900
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:05,400
um we'll do it in moderation medical

901
00:38:02,099 --> 00:38:07,920
medium will have just half a shot of

902
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:10,079
vodka Maybe

903
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:11,520
do you want a Long Island Iced Tea

904
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,960
do you want a Bloody Mary do you want

905
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:15,180
some do you want do you want a rum and

906
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:17,900
coke right we'll do it all in moderation

907
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:17,900
I'll have a drink

908
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:23,040
kidding

909
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:26,099
maybe you even use the term moderation

910
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:28,140
as with any other substance using the

911
00:38:26,099 --> 00:38:31,740
term moderation around alcohol gives us

912
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:34,920
a fuzzy safe warm feeling inside I'm

913
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:36,599
doing it in moderation I can have this

914
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:39,619
beer in this glass of wine right now

915
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:39,619
it's in moderation

916
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:45,780
it's permission to drink in any capacity

917
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:48,060
we feel is appropriate yeah my

918
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:50,760
moderation happens to be three glasses

919
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:53,040
of wine a night I'm not doing six

920
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:55,200
glasses of wine at night I'm doing just

921
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:59,520
three glasses of wine a night that's my

922
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:02,339
moderation ah it's warm and fuzzy

923
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:04,260
that's a slippery slope one person may

924
00:39:02,339 --> 00:39:07,079
drink every single day and still call

925
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:08,820
this moderation heck yeah another person

926
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:10,500
may drink in the afternoons and feel

927
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:12,960
that's moderation because they're not

928
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:15,060
drinking in the morning I don't drink in

929
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:18,780
the morning so my moderation is pretty

930
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:21,660
good it's pretty solid pretty untapped

931
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:23,220
it's right there I mean my moderation is

932
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:24,960
don't drink in the morning I could drink

933
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:27,900
from the afternoon on as long as it's

934
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:30,920
after 12 o'clock in the afternoon I can

935
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:33,119
definitely drink that's my moderation

936
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:35,160
everybody's moderation when it comes to

937
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:37,079
alcohol is different for some it may be

938
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,800
on weekends only I only drink on the

939
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:39,839
weekend

940
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:41,460
that's my moderation I got it totally

941
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:43,380
under control

942
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:45,540
for others it may be one glass of wine

943
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:49,079
at night all week

944
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:51,839
one glass of wine a week

945
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:54,560
and for others moderation may be getting

946
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:58,800
straight out drunk once a month I get

947
00:39:54,560 --> 00:40:01,200
plastered and shit-faced once a month

948
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,820
that's my moderation I don't drink for

949
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:05,579
the whole month

950
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:08,099
and then I totally

951
00:40:05,579 --> 00:40:10,079
get plastered

952
00:40:08,099 --> 00:40:12,300
we hide our alcohol addiction behind the

953
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:15,119
word moderation of it as if it's a

954
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:17,220
shield keeping us from harm moderation

955
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:19,619
is my shield

956
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:21,780
I got a shield right here that's my

957
00:40:19,619 --> 00:40:22,980
moderation Shield right here and I'm in

958
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:25,680
battle

959
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:26,940
I'm really getting hungry though oh I

960
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:29,780
think I'm gonna have a pizza but it's

961
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:29,780
only in moderation

962
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:35,820
meanwhile we make those who recognize

963
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:38,880
themselves as addicts feel different or

964
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:41,220
faulty when that's far from the case

965
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:43,380
yeah no you're an addict

966
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:45,480
when you're you're doing the

967
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:47,400
20-step program

968
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:49,140
you're an addict totally you're an

969
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:51,000

00:40:55,260 --> 00:41:00,780

00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:04,920
disease and you're an alcoholic you

976
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:08,400
better do your 12-step program

977
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:11,460
that's right you better be micromanaged

978
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:13,800
because you're not safe with yourself me

979
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:16,260

be doing your 12-step program man

984
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:26,579
because you're an alcoholic

985
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:29,460
Jacob Johnson said it's amazing how we

986
00:41:26,579 --> 00:41:31,640
rationalize our self-sabotage indeed it

987
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:31,640
is

988
00:41:31,859 --> 00:41:34,920
all right let's talk about moderation

989
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:36,599
Origins for a little bit if you guys

990
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:39,660
hanging in there with me we're gonna

991
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:41,579
make a craving shifter today Gene says I

992
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:44,099
was told to eat fruits in moderation but

993
00:41:41,579 --> 00:41:47,520
I could have eggs dairy sugar

994
00:41:44,099 --> 00:41:50,040
Free Stuff Etc

995
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:51,599
better be careful with fruit better eat

996
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:53,760
fruit in moderation but you can have

997
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:56,820
lots of these

998
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:57,960
could have plenty of eggs six eggs a day

999
00:41:56,820 --> 00:42:01,140
just

1000
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:05,040
be careful with the fruit

1001
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:07,680
gotta watch out don't eat more than one

1002
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:11,060
orange a week but you can have lots of

1003
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:13,800
eggs all week long it's unbelievable

1004
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:15,420
Nicholas Russell I've been following mm

1005
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:17,040
closely really

1006
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:19,200
what did you find

1007
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:22,140
I've been following mm closely for about

1008
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:24,359
seven and a half years boom Nicholas

1009
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:28,040
Russell that's a long time always spot

1010
00:42:24,359 --> 00:42:30,720
on and never once contradicted info

1011
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:33,660
uh I love knowing you're keeping a

1012
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:36,780
record Nicholas that makes me happy mm

1013
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:40,260
info truly is a game changer it works if

1014
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:42,660
you work it with a I think a heart there

1015
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:45,200
thank you Nicholas appreciate it

1016
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:48,500
it's good to know you've been

1017
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:51,839
uh watching over me

1018
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:53,820
waiting for me to screw up someday

1019
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:55,680
and you know the thing is Spirit of

1020
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:58,319
compassion it's hard to contradict

1021
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:59,760
that's the that's the problem like

1022
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:01,800
that's not the problem that's a good

1023
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:04,140
problem to have Spirit of compassion

1024
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:06,180
makes it so I don't contradict because

1025
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:09,060
it's not my information if I was if it

1026
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:09,839
was my information from a human I'm a

1027
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:13,859
human

1028
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:16,500
I think I am right I'm human and so

1029
00:43:13,859 --> 00:43:18,960
if it was coming from me I probably

1030
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:21,660
would have contradicted myself a billion

1031
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:23,160
times over like all the other people do

1032
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:26,040
in health they contradict themselves

1033
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:28,140
yearly weekly daily

1034
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:30,780
and it seems like on social no one

1035
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:32,160
really sees it it's just here today gone

1036
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:34,380
tomorrow they contradicted themselves

1037
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:35,819
six months ago and nobody remembers and

1038
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:38,339
then they start fresh with some other

1039
00:43:35,819 --> 00:43:40,020
bull crap and then they contradict

1040
00:43:38,339 --> 00:43:41,640
themselves on that right but medical

1041
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:43,800
medium

1042
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:45,780
info

1043
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:47,640
hasn't we don't contradict Spirit

1044
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:49,980
compassion and we don't contradict and

1045
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:51,780
we stay consistent and it's always been

1046
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:54,119
like that for years with eight huge

1047
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:56,540
Bibles I mean it's it's really

1048
00:43:54,119 --> 00:43:56,540
incredible

1049
00:44:01,079 --> 00:44:04,640
so that's important to know too

1050
00:44:05,099 --> 00:44:08,579
exactly never contradict itself Lucas

1051
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:10,440
says

1052
00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:13,079

above

1060

all right moderation Origins if you guys

1061
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:35,220
don't mind I would

1062
00:44:32,339 --> 00:44:37,380
I want to proceed if that's okay

1063
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:39,599
even when we know better

1064
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:41,160
when we know not to consume something

1065
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:43,380
that isn't best for our health and

1066
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:45,359
well-being someone around us or

1067
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:49,079
something we see in the media tells us

1068
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:51,839
we can do it in moderation

1069
00:44:49,079 --> 00:44:54,180
even when we know better

1070
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:57,119
someone is going to say you can do that

1071
00:44:54,180 --> 00:45:00,660
in moderation in the media or somebody

1072
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:02,160
you know or whoever a practitioner a

1073
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:03,900
doctor but always listen to your doctors

1074
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:07,200
do what your doctor tells you of course

1075
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:08,280
but I'm just saying someone's gonna tell

1076
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:10,560
you

1077
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:11,880
even when you know better and it's not

1078
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:14,000
good someone's going to tell you to do

1079
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:14,000
it

1080
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:20,040
sometimes it's stated

1081
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:23,460
and sometimes the modern the moderation

1082
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:24,900
message is subliminal

1083
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:25,920
sometimes it's just straight out in

1084
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:30,079
front

1085
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:30,079
sometimes it's subtle

1086
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:34,920
the suggestion is always in our face

1087
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:38,220
whenever we turn

1088
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:40,140
and wherever we turn moderation is

1089
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:41,880
nothing new it goes back hundreds and

1090
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:44,220
hundreds of years in human civilization

1091
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:45,540
this is cool just check this out if you

1092
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:47,579
guys got a second this piece of

1093
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:49,079
information always blows my mind

1094
00:45:47,579 --> 00:45:51,060
it just does

1095
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:52,920
Katrin says Anthony what's going on with

1096
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:55,020
people

1097
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:58,079
who do everything opposite every day

1098
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:59,880
that food smoke caffeine drink on the

1099
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:03,000
weekends no fruits no grains no water

1100
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:04,200
age 45 and no problems why talk about

1101
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,839
that through all the medical medium

1102
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:08,640
books their scale will tip Katrin

1103
00:46:06,839 --> 00:46:11,819
it will tip

1104
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:13,440
and they'll be in a bad place no one's

1105
00:46:11,819 --> 00:46:16,079
escaping sickness

1106
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:17,280
everybody's sick out there now just

1107
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:21,720
about

1108
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:23,400
and there are a few scragglers left that

1109
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:26,040
are 45 and they're still doing what they

1110
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:28,560
want and then when they're 48

1111
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:30,000
it hits sometimes it just hits in

1112
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:31,619
different ways maybe they won't get a

1113
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,180
chronic illness where it's all this

1114
00:46:31,619 --> 00:46:34,980
neurological stuff

1115
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:37,160
and instead they get their first heart

1116
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:37,160
attack

1117
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:45,119
moderation is nothing new it goes back

1118
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:47,220
hundreds and hundreds of years in human

1119
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:49,260
civilization

1120
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:51,839
for as long as it's been human

conditioning

1122
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:55,520
to eat ourselves sick

1123
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:03,380
the concept of everything in moderation

1124
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:03,380

the concept of everything in moderation

1131
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:21,619
arose in ancient times

1132
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:27,060
people are always like oh oh in ancient

1133
00:47:23,579 --> 00:47:29,880
times they knew about this herb oh no

1134
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:35,280
in ancient times they knew about celery

1135
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:37,619
no celery root is not celery celery root

1136
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:40,260
was a soup

1137
00:47:37,619 --> 00:47:43,079
in the 1800s had nothing to do with

1138
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:45,060
people dude juices orange juice the

1139
00:47:43,079 --> 00:47:47,160
industries push it hard they push

1140
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:48,540
moderation really hard and they run with

1141
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:50,400
it because that's how they keep you

1142
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:52,380
conditioned and train you but check this

1143
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:54,599
out

1144
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:56,579
everything in moderation arose in

1145
00:47:54,599 --> 00:47:59,520
ancient times when people first started

1146
00:47:56,579 --> 00:48:02,460
to have the type of access that allowed

1147
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:06,380
them to indulge in excessive consumption

1148
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:06,380
of all times the minute

1149
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:14,400
civilization was able to indulge

1150
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:18,859
they weren't starving to death

1151
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:18,859
they had resources and access

1152
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:25,859
that's when moderation started

1153
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:28,140
hand in hand

1154
00:48:25,859 --> 00:48:30,900
with this newfound instant gratification

1155
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:36,000
the concept of moderation developed as a

1156
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:40,440
way to rain it all in because the minute

1157
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:44,400
civilizations had enough to eat

1158
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:47,700
they would burst their stomachs

1159
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:50,400
they would eat themselves sick

1160
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:51,960
and so they had to learn how to rein it

1161
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:53,400
in and the minute they learned how to

1162
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:55,859
rein it in that's when moderation

1163
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:58,560
started

1164
00:48:55,859 --> 00:49:00,300
this moderation knowledge has now been

1165
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:03,480
in our Consciousness for centuries

1166
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:05,579
that's insane it's unbelievable really

1167
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:08,880
if we're not taught to be careful and

1168
00:49:05,579 --> 00:49:11,280
put limitations on what how when why or

1169
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:15,839
how much we consume we can kill

1170
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:17,700
ourselves in one capacity or another

1171
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:20,520
today

1172
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:23,520
we can kill ourselves today in one

1173
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:26,180
capacity or another

1174
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:26,180
boom

1175
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:34,619
even though the word moderation emerged

1176
00:49:32,099 --> 00:49:36,960
concept emerged as a way to protect

1177
00:49:34,619 --> 00:49:38,880
ourselves

1178
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:40,859
now moderation is being used to

1179
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:44,040
unprotect ourselves did you know that

1180
00:49:40,859 --> 00:49:46,920
moderation is being used in the reverse

1181
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:48,420
way right now you guys to unprotect

1182
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:50,460
ourselves

1183
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:52,680
that's what we're being brainwashed to

1184
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:55,619
do constantly now unprotect ourselves

1185
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:57,720
we're using it moderation as a

1186
00:49:55,619 --> 00:50:00,960
permission to poison ourselves

1187
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:03,200
we're actually using moderation now to

1188
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:06,300
give us permission to poison ourselves

1189
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:10,200
whatever we want to indulge in or harm

1190
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:14,040
ourselves with we can do it so in good

1191
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:16,380
Consciousness right by saying

1192
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:18,480
in good conscious we're doing it in

1193
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:20,700
moderation we're meant to have the tools

1194
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:22,800
and knowledge and resources to not go

1195
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:25,200
down this road though and that's another

1196
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:26,160
point we're meant not to have to go down

1197
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:27,540
this road

1198
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:31,380
but

1199
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:33,599
what's happened now is it's being used

1200
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:35,760
to control us

1201
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:37,319
to control what we purchase out there

1202
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:40,280
now and

1203
00:50:37,319 --> 00:50:40,280
to eat now

1204
00:50:43,079 --> 00:50:48,359
it's hard to break away from the status

1205
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:51,420
quo of moderation because it's so built

1206
00:50:48,359 --> 00:50:52,740
in society it is weaved into society now

1207
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:56,460
as

1208
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:58,559
a weapon moderation has been weaponized

1209
00:50:56,460 --> 00:51:02,940
right now

1210
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:05,640
so much so that if you start eating

1211
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:07,859
to heal someone's gonna call you

1212
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:09,900
orthorexic

1213
00:51:07,859 --> 00:51:12,119
if you start eating to heal this is

1214
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:14,280
incredible kale right here this kale is

1215
00:51:12,119 --> 00:51:16,319
insanely good

1216
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:18,780
if you start eating to take care of

1217
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:20,579
yourself and heal

1218
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:22,440
and you you're sticking with your celery

1219
00:51:20,579 --> 00:51:24,540
juice every single morning you can be

1220
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:28,319
called orthorexic or that the medical

1221
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:31,079
medium protocols or create orthorexia or

1222
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:33,540
something that's how weaved in

1223
00:51:31,079 --> 00:51:35,940
moderation has been it's weaponized

1224
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:37,800
right now it's actually weaponized so

1225
00:51:35,940 --> 00:51:40,800
you're not allowed to have your spinage

1226
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:43,500
and your heavy metal detox smoothies and

1227
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:46,500
your incredible celery juice

1228
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:48,180
and your protocols to heal and eat as

1229
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:49,920
much fruit as you want or whatever it is

1230
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:52,079
you're not allowed to because the minute

1231
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:54,300
you start doing the right things to take

1232
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:57,619
your healing further and further they

1233
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:57,619
weaponized moderation

1234
00:51:57,900 --> 00:52:03,900
to actually use against anyone in that

1235
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:05,579
moment to totally screw with their head

1236
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:06,660
you can feel like you're on top of the

1237
00:52:05,579 --> 00:52:08,579
world you're taking care of yourself

1238
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:10,800
you're actually juicing you're you're

1239
00:52:08,579 --> 00:52:12,780
working on healing and then someone will

1240
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:14,880
turn around on social or somewhere and

1241
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:16,380
be like oh you're just orthorexic now

1242
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:18,780
and it scares the crap out of somebody

1243
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:21,359
and they'll be like what I am what do

1244
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:23,099
you mean oh like you can you can eat

1245
00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:25,200
healthy in moderation but you should be

1246
00:52:23,099 --> 00:52:26,520
able to do everything you want to do but

1247
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:28,079
I was sick

1248
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:30,660
oh it doesn't matter you should still

1249
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:32,900
just do moderation like it's weaponized

1250
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:32,900
now

1251
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:38,099
it's hard to break away from the status

1252
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:40,740
quo of moderation because it's so

1253
00:52:38,099 --> 00:52:43,079
weaponized in society if you choose to

1254
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:45,960
fight the brainwashing of moderation you

1255
00:52:43,079 --> 00:52:48,180
get your wrists smacked if you want to

1256
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:51,839
fight moderation someone's going to

1257
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:54,420
smack your wrists with a ruler

1258
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:56,040
you get punished by others who don't

1259
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:58,260
want to break their own habits and

1260
00:52:56,040 --> 00:53:00,180
lifestyle of using moderation to consume

1261
00:52:58,260 --> 00:53:02,819
foods and substances that aren't

1262
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:03,660
benefiting them what happens is you're a

1263
00:53:02,819 --> 00:53:05,880
threat

1264
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:08,520
when you take care of yourself

1265
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:12,319
you're a threat in the medical medium

1266
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:12,319
Community if you do it right

1267
00:53:12,540 --> 00:53:18,180
because you're a threat to somebody else

1268
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:20,579
outside of the community

1269
00:53:18,180 --> 00:53:23,160
that doesn't want to be told

1270
00:53:20,579 --> 00:53:24,599
they should eat better they want to do

1271
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:25,859
it their way

1272
00:53:24,599 --> 00:53:27,960
they want to have all their chocolate

1273
00:53:25,859 --> 00:53:29,339
bars they want to eat their eggs even

1274
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:31,260
though they're sick and it's making them

1275
00:53:29,339 --> 00:53:33,300
sick they want to do whatever they're

1276
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:35,160
doing their apple cider vinegar or

1277
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:36,420
whatever they want they want to do what

1278
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:38,760
they're doing and they don't want to be

1279
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:41,040
they don't want to be shown

1280
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:42,720
that it probably isn't a good idea so

1281
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:44,579
then they'll turn around and bite the

1282
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:45,839
person and be like no you're orthorexic

1283
00:53:44,579 --> 00:53:48,599
you shouldn't be taking care of yourself

1284
00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:49,619
they weaponize it people get bullied and

1285
00:53:48,599 --> 00:53:52,260
that's what we're talking about now

1286
00:53:49,619 --> 00:53:54,540
bullying they get bullied big time for

1287
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:56,099
it even in families in society and

1288
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:59,040
Friends

1289
00:53:56,099 --> 00:54:00,660
by strangers it's so hard for people to

1290
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:03,059
heal when they're being bullied and

1291
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:05,540
moderation is being weaponized against

1292
00:54:03,059 --> 00:54:05,540
people

1293
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:10,619
and so is the whole term orthorexia

1294
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:13,020
which means that was a term did you know

1295
00:54:10,619 --> 00:54:15,059
that was a conventional term created to

1296
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:18,260
stop somebody from taking care of

1297
00:54:15,059 --> 00:54:21,180
themselves did you guys know that

1298
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:24,480
orthorexia was a conventional term

1299
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:27,800
created to stop someone from starting a

1300
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:27,800
journey of eating healthier

1301
00:54:29,579 --> 00:54:32,720
that is a sick

1302
00:54:32,819 --> 00:54:38,040
what's sicker than that

1303
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:40,260
what's sicker than just the dumbass

1304
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:42,900
guy or professional that created that

1305
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:44,760
term back in the 80s because he didn't

1306
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:47,040
like to see somebody actually eating

1307
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:48,900
better what's sicker than that if

1308
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:51,119
somebody

1309
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:52,859
in the health communities or even the

1310
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:54,480
medical medium Community that's trying

1311
00:54:52,859 --> 00:54:55,500
to sabotage other people and they use

1312
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:58,940
that term

1313
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:58,940
that's actually even sicker

1314
00:55:00,599 --> 00:55:04,980
if you choose to fight the brainwashing

1315
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:08,579
of moderation you get your risks back to

1316
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:10,740
get punished by others you get bullied

1317
00:55:08,579 --> 00:55:12,540
punished by others and bullied by people

1318
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:15,559
who don't want to break their own habits

1319
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:18,300
or lifestyle so they lean on moderation

1320
00:55:15,559 --> 00:55:20,579
so they can consume foods and substances

1321
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:23,780
that aren't benefiting them

1322
00:55:20,579 --> 00:55:23,780
they're delusional

1323
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:29,280
Aquarian passion says

1324
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:32,240
so refreshing to find you with three

1325
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:32,240
explanation points

1326
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:39,540
Laura says I have been called orthorexic

1327
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:42,319
and believed it until medical medium and

1328
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:42,319
learning the truth

1329
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:51,780
medical uh meaning France says I've

1330
00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:55,760
bullied in my been bullied in my family

1331
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:55,760
for five years for doing medical medium

1332
00:55:56,059 --> 00:56:01,020
those who give themselves permission to

1333
00:55:58,859 --> 00:56:03,059
indulge in what they know deep down

1334
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:05,760
isn't good for them

1335
00:56:03,059 --> 00:56:08,940
find it unsettling and even threatening

1336
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:12,260
when you decide to go in your own

1337
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:15,660
Direction and heal

1338
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:17,099
including people that dabble in the

1339
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:18,660
medical medium community that sell

1340
00:56:17,099 --> 00:56:22,640
programs and all kinds of stuff they

1341
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:22,640
they don't want to be told

1342
00:56:23,339 --> 00:56:28,680
that you're doing it

1343
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:31,079
they want to be able to just roll you

1344
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:34,339
and tell you how to do it there's that I

1345
00:56:31,079 --> 00:56:34,339
see that too it's really sad

1346
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:40,800
they want to even kind of shake you up

1347
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:41,760
and shift your brain you're taking care

1348
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:43,680
of yourself you're doing the medical

1349
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:45,720
meeting protocols you're doing a great

1350
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:47,460
job you've already done some healing and

1351
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:49,700
then they try to shake you up and be

1352
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:49,700
like

1353
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:55,200
why are you doing it that way should do

1354
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:58,380
it my way and then when you look my way

1355
00:56:55,200 --> 00:57:01,140
which is you not orthorexic it's

1356
00:56:58,380 --> 00:57:03,240
moderation meanwhile it's normal to be

1357
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:06,059
sick though

1358
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:07,619
as you age you gotta you can get on a

1359
00:57:06,059 --> 00:57:09,780
ton of medications and be in the

1360
00:57:07,619 --> 00:57:12,900
hospital all the time that's great

1361
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:14,760
well that's a great place to be

1362
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:15,960
don't do it right so you're in you know

1363
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:17,160
so you're in the hospital all the time

1364
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:19,740
down the road when you age and

1365
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:22,819
everything else and

1366
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:22,819
it's just unbelievable

1367
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:27,960
it makes people uncomfortable when you

1368
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:30,359
start to find empowerment and take

1369
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:32,880
control over your health and become

1370
00:57:30,359 --> 00:57:35,760
aware that certain foods and substances

1371
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:38,359
even in moderation aren't doing you

1372
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:38,359
justice

1373
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:43,619
instead of questioning their own

1374
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:47,099
practices these moderation champions

1375
00:57:43,619 --> 00:57:51,300
and orthorexic champions tend to point

1376
00:57:47,099 --> 00:57:53,880
to you as if you're out of balance

1377
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:55,460
the more uncomfortable they feel the

1378
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:58,079
higher and the more

1379
00:57:55,460 --> 00:58:00,780
insistently they start waiving the

1380
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:03,480
moderation and orthorexic flag

1381
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:06,380
they're watching you do your thing and

1382
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:09,540
they're like trying to throw shade in it

1383
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:12,599
orthorexic moderation

1384
00:58:09,540 --> 00:58:15,180
Tamara Jones says that's gaslighting gas

1385
00:58:12,599 --> 00:58:16,920
lighting indeed it sure is to trigger

1386
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:19,680
somebody to doubt themselves well that's

1387
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:21,660
what a whole bunch of people do out

1388
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:24,480
there

1389
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:27,540
and volca says my mom was not sick like

1390
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:29,220
ever and hit her 70s and Wham chronic

1391
00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:31,859
illness is popping up

1392
00:58:29,220 --> 00:58:33,900
and more after C triggering more issues

1393
00:58:31,859 --> 00:58:35,900
sure there are people that skate by to

1394
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:39,359
their 70 but that's rare that's rare

1395
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:41,880
that that's that's not happening anymore

1396
00:58:39,359 --> 00:58:45,000
I'm letting you know that that's there's

1397
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:46,859
only gonna be a few of those

1398
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:48,900
and then not even a few of those anymore

1399
00:58:46,859 --> 00:58:50,280
people aren't going to be 70 and then

1400
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:51,660
they get sick when they're 70. they're

1401
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:52,619
all going to be getting sick in their

1402
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:54,240
20s

1403
00:58:52,619 --> 00:58:55,980
everyone's going to be getting sick of

1404
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:59,000
their 20s coming up

1405
00:58:55,980 --> 00:58:59,000
that's where it's going

1406
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:10,319
yes there's people in the community that

1407
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:12,359
used to be in the community

1408
00:59:10,319 --> 00:59:14,940
and they wanted to sell programs and do

1409
00:59:12,359 --> 00:59:16,099
and and all that off of medical medium

1410
00:59:14,940 --> 00:59:18,420
information or whatever they're doing

1411
00:59:16,099 --> 00:59:21,000
and then they go and they try to put

1412
00:59:18,420 --> 00:59:22,740
down other people's heads in hopes that

1413
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:24,599
they gain more followers and stuff to

1414
00:59:22,740 --> 00:59:27,059
sell more programs to that's happened

1415
00:59:24,599 --> 00:59:28,680
over the years it's kind of like a thing

1416
00:59:27,059 --> 00:59:30,780
and then they throw words like

1417
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:32,700
orthorexic out where they throw other

1418
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:34,680
stuff with moderation because they try

1419
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:37,920
to screw up the person's thinking in

1420
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:39,420
heads and just mess them up and in the

1421
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:43,680
end the whole thing's sad because it

1422
00:59:39,420 --> 00:59:46,380
just doesn't get anybody anywhere

1423
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:49,799
a chance to grow free

1424
00:59:46,380 --> 00:59:50,640
we are smart our souls are wise do you

1425
00:59:49,799 --> 00:59:52,440
hear that

1426
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:54,839
you know what I love about Spirit of

1427
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:58,319
compassion

1428
00:59:54,839 --> 01:00:01,559
it's like I remember writing that

1429
00:59:58,319 --> 01:00:03,540
and something Felt So Good In the Moment

1430
01:00:01,559 --> 01:00:06,900
I was sitting at my desk

1431
01:00:03,540 --> 01:00:08,220
and SOC said we are smart and I wrote We

1432
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:10,020
are smart

1433
01:00:08,220 --> 01:00:12,000
and then Spirit of compassion said our

1434
01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:13,859
souls are wise and I wrote our souls

1435
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:16,440
were wise

1436
01:00:13,859 --> 01:00:19,440
and then I wrote

1437
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:20,819
from SOC when we're finally given the

1438
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:22,980
knowledge

1439
01:00:20,819 --> 01:00:25,020
the correct knowledge

1440
01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:29,240
about how to heal

1441
01:00:25,020 --> 01:00:29,240
we have the potential to recognize it

1442
01:00:30,359 --> 01:00:33,599
when I wrote that like my hair was

1443
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:35,940
standing up

1444
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:38,280
back of my neck I was just like

1445
01:00:35,940 --> 01:00:39,599
Goosebumps everywhere and I feel like

1446
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:42,000
that now

1447
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:42,900
if we have struggled enough with our

1448
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:45,660
health

1449
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:46,619
that the blindfold of Health Dogma has

1450
01:00:45,660 --> 01:00:49,140
come off

1451
01:00:46,619 --> 01:00:51,440
we can see the information here for what

1452
01:00:49,140 --> 01:00:51,440
it is

1453
01:00:51,540 --> 01:00:55,319
and spirit of compassion gave me those

1454
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:57,660
words to write

1455
01:00:55,319 --> 01:01:00,799
like

1456
01:00:57,660 --> 01:01:00,799
who would ever know that

1457
01:01:01,799 --> 01:01:04,579
the truth

1458
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:10,020
then it's like recognizing a soul mate

1459
01:01:06,780 --> 01:01:12,839
after years of relationships gone awry

1460
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:16,200
whether suddenly or slowly we realize

1461
01:01:12,839 --> 01:01:19,079
that those past relationships we

1462
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:22,319
contorted ourselves into in desperation

1463
01:01:19,079 --> 01:01:24,420
didn't go wrong because of some flaw in

1464
01:01:22,319 --> 01:01:26,940
Who We Are

1465
01:01:24,420 --> 01:01:29,760
just like a healthy relationship the

1466
01:01:26,940 --> 01:01:32,280
truth about healing may push us to grow

1467
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:36,059
if we give ourselves that chance to grow

1468
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:39,240
we give ourselves the chance to heal

1469
01:01:36,059 --> 01:01:44,099
there's so much depth in this right here

1470
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:46,079
if you even read into it and really read

1471
01:01:44,099 --> 01:01:48,420
what that is it

1472
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:50,400
is more even there than even your

1473
01:01:48,420 --> 01:01:52,500
reading

1474
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:54,960
when on the other hand we take

1475
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:58,260
moderation and apply it to the world of

1476
01:01:54,960 --> 01:02:02,180
poisons and toxins we push it too far

1477
01:01:58,260 --> 01:02:04,799
now we're taking the basic

1478
01:02:02,180 --> 01:02:06,240
problematic standard of moderation and

1479
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:09,660
exalting it

1480
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:11,579
to a place recklessly

1481
01:02:09,660 --> 01:02:15,000

what to say I can't be in a billion

1708
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:26,640
places at once I can't remind people

1709
01:11:24,060 --> 01:11:29,580
about tools and resources every minute I

1710
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:30,900
want to but it's hard to do and people

1711
01:11:29,580 --> 01:11:33,179
say oh

1712
01:11:30,900 --> 01:11:35,340

why this company is the greatest that

1715
01:11:36,780 --> 01:11:40,800
I've ever found yet it's why I fully

1716
01:11:38,940 --> 01:11:42,960
endorsed them but anyway

1717
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:45,900

1718
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:48,300

protocols like seriously I just feel bad

1724
01:11:58,199 --> 01:12:04,260
what I'm saying is I actually feel bad

1725
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:06,960
I feel bad for people you know when a

1726
01:12:04,260 --> 01:12:09,120
friend reaches out to me and says aw I

1727
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:11,340
hate to bother you but right now I got

1728
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:14,159
the worst flu and I'm like okay can you

1729
01:12:11,340 --> 01:12:16,920
use this stuff that you're supposed to

1730
01:12:14,159 --> 01:12:18,540
have on hand they're like I never got it

1731
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:20,820
I'm like what do you want me to do about

1732
01:12:18,540 --> 01:12:22,679
it you want me to magically snap my like

1733
01:12:20,820 --> 01:12:24,360
my finger and all of a sudden it all

1734
01:12:22,679 --> 01:12:26,640
appears you should have gotten it you

1735
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:29,040
should have had it in your toolkit I

1736
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:33,300

01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:44,760
it's just that I feel bad and the thing

1741
01:12:41,820 --> 01:12:48,840
is we're not done with cold and flu and

1742
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:50,280
RSV everybody is going to be up for the

1743
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:53,699
possibility of getting their butts

1744
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:57,239
whooped again in a month because a whole

1745
01:12:53,699 --> 01:12:59,100
nother round is rolling through

1746
01:12:57,239 --> 01:13:00,900
and just when you think that's done

1747
01:12:59,100 --> 01:13:02,400
there's the spring one that's going to

1748
01:13:00,900 --> 01:13:05,280

1757
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:32,540

1758
01:13:29,100 --> 01:13:32,540
get my basil in there

1759
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:35,540
big hunk

1760
01:13:35,580 --> 01:13:39,739
half cup tightly packed spinach

1761
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:45,239
dropped some nice spinach in here I'm

1762
01:13:43,739 --> 01:13:48,300
excited

1763
01:13:45,239 --> 01:13:51,900
I'm really looking forward to this one a

1764
01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:53,640
Cravings Buster I don't mind having a

1765
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:55,860
Cravings busted right and they busted

1766
01:13:53,640 --> 01:13:59,699
right now it might stop me from drinking

1767
01:13:55,860 --> 01:14:02,520
the rest of this is it okay to actually

1768
01:13:59,699 --> 01:14:03,719
to drink my wine before I do the craving

1769
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:07,340
Buster

1770
01:14:03,719 --> 01:14:07,340
no it's a bad idea

1771
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:12,060
white wine

1772
01:14:09,659 --> 01:14:15,000
there's no wine there it's apple juice

1773
01:14:12,060 --> 01:14:17,100
for God's sake

1774
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:19,920
okay we should have just about a half

1775
01:14:17,100 --> 01:14:21,300
cup in there because spinach packs down

1776
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:24,620
real tight

1777
01:14:21,300 --> 01:14:24,620
like that all right good

1778
01:14:24,900 --> 01:14:28,140
it really turns into nothing once you

1779
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:32,900
pack that down

1780
01:14:28,140 --> 01:14:32,900
okay half cup chopped kale

1781
01:14:33,719 --> 01:14:36,440
yep

1782
01:14:37,260 --> 01:14:42,840
nice

1783
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:45,739
half cup chopped kale put this big old

1784
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:48,600
kale leaf in here right now

1785
01:14:45,739 --> 01:14:51,260
and maybe I'll put the rest of that stem

1786
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:51,260
in there too

1787
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:59,100
all right what else do we need

1788
01:14:55,140 --> 01:15:03,260
half cup of chopped cabbage

1789
01:14:59,100 --> 01:15:03,260
cabbage coming right up

1790
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:08,960
we need our cabbage

1791
01:15:09,420 --> 01:15:15,179
let's get it going here

1792
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:17,640
you guys wasn't that an amazing amount

1793
01:15:15,179 --> 01:15:20,820
of information about moderation and all

1794
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:23,640
that wasn't that incredible

1795
01:15:20,820 --> 01:15:27,000
like I feel like it's so empowered

1796
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:29,640
having that data having those details

1797
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:32,219
having that information and what a great

1798
01:15:29,640 --> 01:15:34,199
way to empower

1799
01:15:32,219 --> 01:15:36,719
the mind

1800
01:15:34,199 --> 01:15:39,000
I mean truly it really kind of blows my

1801
01:15:36,719 --> 01:15:41,820
mind in so many ways

1802
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:44,820
what else do we have on the list here

1803
01:15:41,820 --> 01:15:46,739
we have a half orange peeled everybody

1804
01:15:44,820 --> 01:15:48,980
we just get that spinach down in there a

1805
01:15:46,739 --> 01:15:48,980
little bit

1806
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:54,239
I peeled it

1807
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:58,699
here

1808
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:58,699
that's a nice size orange though so

1809
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:04,699
you get some orange sound in there

1810
01:16:02,340 --> 01:16:04,699
nice

1811
01:16:05,820 --> 01:16:09,020
cut this orange up

1812
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:12,980

1813
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:19,920
there we go pushing that orange down in

1814
01:16:18,719 --> 01:16:22,440
there

1815
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:25,580

1821

to have stock but that's a small stock I

1823
01:16:43,620 --> 01:16:48,300
