1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,799
it out there people catch a bug they get

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:08,040
sick they're coughing their lungs out

3
00:00:05,799 --> 00:00:11,480
they're really sick they got fevers

4
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:12,960
going up and down they start to recover

5
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:15,320
they go to a doctor they get on an

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:19,279
antibiotic whatever it is they start to

7
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:20,519
recover and then they stay sick they

8
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:22,800
think they're going to recover and

9
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:25,160
bounce back completely but they're

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,119
dragging or two weeks later they're

11
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,640
doing a little better and then it hits

12
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,720
them and they're dragging and they're

13
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,439
going down

14
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,399
and what's happening out there people

15
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:37,079
are getting sick and then they're

16
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,920
falling into this chronically ill

17
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:40,559
trigger and now they're getting all

18
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:43,320
these different things like brain fog

19
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:46,280
and weird tingles and numbness on their

20
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,360
body and aches and pains and fatigue and

21
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:50,000
brain fog again and they just don't feel

22
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:52,600
themselves and now they're triggered

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,120
into something entirely different

24
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,520
because of the bugs going around right

25
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,920
now right now in New England in the

26
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,359
United States there's a stomach flu

27
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,680
neuro virus and and it's pounding the

28
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:06,040
crap out of people right now up there

29
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:09,600

30
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:13,000
United States and around the world and

31
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,799

00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,960
and gut disturbances and we're going to

33
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,439
cover that a little bit cuz I want to

34
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,119
talk about that like what does it do in

35
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:23,479
the gut like what happens there's people

36
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:26,320
all about you know microbiome what

37
00:01:23,479 --> 00:01:28,479
happens if you get the neuro virus and

38
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,240
you got the stomach flu and it's ripping

39
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:32,079
through your guts and you're sitting

40
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,840

42
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:38,759
then what like what happened how's your

43
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,320
microbiome then is it all fixed is it

44
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:42,840
all great what's it like nobody really

45
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,960
talks about that they don't talk about

46
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,240
what happens when boom you get that

47
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,759
neuro virus and you got the stomach flu

48
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:51,439
and then is your microbiome is is that

49
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,040
going to get back to normal wasn't even

50
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:55,680
normal to begin with and is it going to

51
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,439
get back to normal eventually or is it

52
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,079
going to be out of balance now for next

53
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:00,840
another two years until you get another

54
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:01,920

so it's good information very important

89
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:15,239
but I'm here to talk about our immune

90
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,000
system and how it's getting pretty beat

91
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:18,239
up these days with what people are going

92
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,760
through do you know anybody that's

93
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,200
coughing do you know anybody that's got

94
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,360
a sore throat and a fever do you know

95
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,959
anybody who's been hit with anything

96
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,360
that's going on because people have been

97
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,840
getting hit it's like a surgence of it

98
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,920
insurgence of it happening right now

99
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,840
this is like one of those hot spots

100
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,040
we're in where it's just really starting

101
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,760
to pick up pace I hear it all the time

102
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:40,920
people are sick for a month with it

103
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:45,799
coughing out their lungs the whole bit

104
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:50,080
but then to add insult to injury there

105
00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:54,599
is a neov virus stomach flu hyper catchy

106
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:56,760
hyper catchy that's actually steaming

107
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:58,920
streaming right out of New England right

108
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:01,840
now and it's going to be cutting across

109
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:03,799
the country and and you know overseas

110
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,280
and everywhere else and that one really

111
00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:07,799
sucks really really sucks so what I'm

112
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:10,120
doing right now is the reason why I'm

113
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:13,120
even here is because I'm saying are you

114
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:14,680
taking care of your immune system are

115
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,959
you taking care of your immune system

116
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:20,040
right so I have my family on this right

117
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:22,680

118
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:25,120
my family and my closest friends you

00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:28,479
know safeguarding them too and all that

120
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,639
so that's the total immune blend do you

00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,960
have it what's crazy out there is what

122
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,280
I'm seeing right now is all these

123
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,560
different supplements are coming out

124
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,919

we're going to talk about some stuff in

145
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,800

155
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:45,520
themselves and armed their immune

156
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:47,160
systems for what was coming but I want

157
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,840

00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:57,440
it's struggling that's the whole point

186
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,680
it can't handle exposures it can't

187
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,599
handle the toxic heavy metal exposures

188
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,240
and then the herbicide and the fungicide

189
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:06,199
exposures and the

190
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:08,199
fragrances and the caffeine addiction it

191
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:10,840
can't handle the immune system can't

192
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:13,199
handle that so many people are drowning

193
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:15,599
themselves with coffee and espresso

194
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,400
drinks and they're just beating the crap

195
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:20,720
out of their immune system so immune

196
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:23,720
system is just under attack all the time

197
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:26,639
and So eventually what that leads us to

198
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:29,440
is a sickness no matter

199
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:31,680
what everyone is going to get a sick

200
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,000
symptom no matter what you see somebody

201
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,360
out there right now they're on social

202
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
like yeah I'm doing this I'm doing that

203
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:38,199
I'm Into Fitness I'm into this you're

204
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
going to have a symptom you're going to

205
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:41,800
have a symptom it's going to come later

206
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,919
maybe but you're going to be pushed over

207
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,479
the edge too many exposures your immune

208
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:47,199
system is going to finally kick down and

209
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:50,440
you're going to be in the immune system

210
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:52,360
pit just like everybody else so keeping

211
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:55,039
our immune system strong is critical

212
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:57,680
having immune system power is

213
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:58,800
critical having it strong and you'll

it's going to dominate social

248
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:18,360
entirely to a point where all articles

249
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:20,320
out there all the media is going to be

250
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:22,480

00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:28,720
this is just what it's going to be by

253
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,920
2030 nothing but sickness sickness

254
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,959
sickness

255
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,560
everywhere and that's the world we live

256
00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:35,440
in that's the world we're going to be

257
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:36,959
living in and that's how crazy it really

258
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,040
is when you really think about it right

259
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,480
I mean did you ever expect that did you

260
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,720
ever expect

261
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:45,040
that yeah you're not alone so let's talk

262
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,920
about the immune system a little bit and

263
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:52,800
why it's so important to support it not

264
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:56,040
just support it rebuild it rebuild it

265
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:58,160
critical really is writing for truth on

266
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:02,240
IG says do you take the total immune

267
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:05,720
blend every day even when not sick I do

268
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:09,000
I take it every single day even when not

269
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:11,360
sick I take it every day okay but you

270
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,360
can take it every day right do what your

271
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:16,320
doctor wants to do but I tell my family

272
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,880
you can take it every day but you can

273
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:21,000
take a smaller dosage if you're not sick

274
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,760
every single day then when you get sick

275
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,959
or you're struggling with something you

276
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:27,000
can increase the the dosage to what your

277
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:29,600
whatever doctor believes or however

278
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:33,640
what's in it a

279
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:36,680
blend of thyme and Mullen and a little

280
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:39,399
touch of zinc it's this perfect

281
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:41,959
combination right here and what people

282
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:44,920
don't realize it's the quality of the

283
00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:47,839
time on top of it it's the quality of

284
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:50,760
the Mullen that you don't get in other

285
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:52,600
places it doesn't happen it just doesn't

286
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:55,680
I know I know the quality I know what

287
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:58,360
they do I know how they do it and it's

288
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:01,160
unbelievable it's about making sure that

289
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:03,200
alcohol wasn't used that alcohol is not

290
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:05,440
involved at any level making sure all

291
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:09,240
these different things matter that this

292
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:11,279
is really clean but the real thing not

293
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,440
everybody saying good quality this is

294
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,320
good quality everybody's allowed to say

295
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,600
that did you know that you're allowed to

296
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,680
say everything's good quality did you

297
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,480
know that anybody who just opens up a

298
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,959
door hangs a shingle and sells something

299
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,120
they're allowed to say our quality is

300
00:11:19,959 --> 00:11:25,680
great nothing beats our quality there is

301
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:29,200
a difference huge difference that's

302
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:31,760
important to know it really is an IG

303
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:36,079

Matter Details Matter I agree I see that

309
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:53,639
right there okay so let's go into it a

310
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:58,320
little

311
00:11:53,639 --> 00:12:00,399
bit all right couple of things to know

312
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:03,040
one is

313
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:06,880
why are immune systems so chopped up why

314
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:09,160
are they so beat up and that's something

315
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:11,079
that nobody really talks about they're

316
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:13,760
just like this is immune supportive

317
00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:16,959
immune supportive everybody's immune

318
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:19,240
system is just beaten to a pul basically

319
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:20,800
and that's why everybody's so sick it's

320
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,920
struggling immune system you got to

321
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,920
remember that if there's anything

322
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:30,440
someone's dealing with instantly the

323
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:32,760
immune system is under siege Under Siege

324
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:34,880
if someone's got panic attacks and they

325
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:36,880
got the Titan chest and they got that

326
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,560
Vagas nerve I talk about that Vagas

327
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,279
nerves the

328
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,120
inflammation and they're dealing with

329
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:45,399
all kinds of anxiety and panic and all

330
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:47,199
these other things immune system

331
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:49,839
everything is like that thyroid

332
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:52,480
condition at all thyroid anybody

333
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:56,079
hypothyroid hyperthyroid any kind of

334
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:59,480
thyroid problems at all anything

335
00:12:56,079 --> 00:13:03,680
Graves whatever it is nodul in the

336
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:06,160
thyroid whatever it is immune system was

337
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:08,680
challenged the thyroids immune system

338
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,920
was challenged the liver's immune system

339
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:13,120
was challenged and then weakened and

340
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:15,040
then kicked down a notch so people walk

341
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,560
around with weak immune systems that's

342
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:20,760
what they do all day long and then the

343
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:23,199
thyroid disorders creep up and then the

344
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:25,279
panic and the aches and pains creep up

345
00:13:23,199 --> 00:13:26,880
and then the vertigo and the tentis and

346
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:29,480
the tingles and numbness and the body

347
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:33,000
aches and pains and the trigal neur Alia

348
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:34,760
all creep up because their immune system

349
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,720
is suffering their immune system is

350
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:40,560
struggling so very important to know so

351
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:43,240
let's talk about like stomach flu I want

352
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:47,120
to go into that a little bit stomach

353
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:48,600
flu okay so the reason why I would take

354
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,120
like something every single day or I

355
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:52,560
tell family to take something every

356
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:55,079
single day like I tell my family take a

357
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:58,079
little bit of this take little bit of

358
00:13:55,079 --> 00:13:59,920
the propolis every single day right

359
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:01,880
little bit of the golden seal every

360
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,680
single day this is what I tell my family

361
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:06,120
to do all the time and a little bit of

362
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,600
B12 and I want to talk about why B12 is

363
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:11,600
critical cuz when we catch something

364
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:13,519
like the neuro virus or white lung yeah

365
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,959
which is really hurting a lot of people

366
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,399
I mean they get scar tissue in the lung

367
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:19,519
that lasts

368
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:22,360
forever I mean that's just unfair like

369
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:24,880
why do they put bugs out there like this

370
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:26,240
so that we get injuries in our lungs and

371
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,839
then for a lifetime we actually have

372
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,560
scar tissue in our lungs like does that

373
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:32,680
make any sense

374
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:36,079
so I tell my friends and family it's

375
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:38,279
critical to get B12 in you after

376
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:40,320
especially after you've been hit with

377
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:44,839
something because you need that extra

378
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:47,480
B12 to power up the nerves so important

379
00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:49,440
that alone okay and so what I'm telling

380
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:52,199
my family right now with all these these

381
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,800
hard times of people getting sick cuz

382
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:56,360
it's it's really sad when you see

383
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:58,680
somebody really struggling they get what

384
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:00,480
feels like a cold to start with then it

385
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:02,440
then it lingers then it runs into a

386
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,839
fever and up and down and then after

387
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:07,040
that when they're better they're not

388
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:09,839
better because now their immune system

389
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:12,639
was dropped and they were triggered into

390
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:15,880
something else an Epstein bar rising up

391
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:17,399
out of nowhere herbus simplex one rising

392
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:19,759
up from nowhere because that's what's

393
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:21,959
happening to people people are getting

394
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:24,759
shingles a month after they get white

395
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:26,759
lung a month later they have the

396
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:29,199
shingles because their immune system was

397
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:31,079
so kicked down to the bottom that the

398
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:33,519
jingles virus said this is my time to

399
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:35,600
shine and then it comes up and it just

400
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:37,360
boom it's up there let's talk about the

401
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,800
Norovirus that's coming around and it's

402
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:42,480
circulating right now and it's it's

403
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:44,480
kicking up so right now there's a

404
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:47,399
stomach bug out there and what people

405
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:52,040
don't realize is that a stomach bug can

406
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:55,920
knock your gut balance off for a really

407
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:58,000
long time really long time but what you

408
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:01,040
what you'll never see out there is what

409
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,680
happens in inside the intestinal track

410
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:06,079
when that bug is around so let's go into

411
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:08,360
that let's let's try to like makeshift a

412
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:11,560
little bit of an intestinal track

413
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:15,120
okay so let's do that we'll make shift a

414
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:19,399
little bit of a a colon here

415
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:21,199
right all right and then we'll just do a

416
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:24,920
little intestinal track in the center

417
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:28,720
here if you guys can see this

418
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:32,319
okay so you pick up the stomach flu pick

419
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:35,399
up the neuro virus you get it in your

420
00:16:32,319 --> 00:16:37,240
mouth just goes in you you breathe it in

421
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:41,399
it's on your tongue now it's heading

422
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:44,880
down to your gut okay and it's on its

423
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:48,120
way so that virus is getting there okay

424
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,920
virus goes down the dadum it's it starts

425
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,839
in your stomach right it goes down your

426
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:55,160
stomach in your dadum it's heading in

427
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:58,519
there and what that virus is doing is

428
00:16:55,160 --> 00:17:01,360
it's multiplying really fast and it's

429
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:03,920
it's feeding off of foods that you eat

430
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:06,760
so it's multiplying it's exploding so

431
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:09,880
what a stomach virus does is it

432
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:13,240
proliferates at a speed no other bug Pro

433
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:16,000
proliferates no other bug fires up to

434
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:18,760
that degree to multiplies to that degree

435
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,079
spawns to that degree but the neuro

436
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:24,160
virus

437
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:27,280
explodes and it feeds off of undigested

438
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:29,880
proteins it feeds off of gluten that's

439
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:32,840
in the system from you ate a week ago

440
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:36,120
yeah a week ago it feeds off of any egg

441
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:38,880
residue egg material any kind of egg

442
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:41,640
material in your gut it feeds off of

443
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:43,799
that and then it feeds off of any dairy

444
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:46,280
products and then it feeds off of other

445
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:49,919
things it'll feed off of soy

446
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:52,520
potentially it'll feed off of virtually

447
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:58,600
anything right so what it does is it

448
00:17:52,520 --> 00:18:01,679
feeds and it explodes it produces itself

449
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:04,880
rapidly like rapidly and it's highly

450
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:08,320
toxic so what the neuro virus is is it's

451
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:11,000
a bug that when it produces the bug then

452
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:14,240
goes to the intestinal lining walls and

453
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,840
it starts to make divots it starts to

454
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,240
basically try to poke holes in your

455
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,280
intestinal tract and your colon but

456
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:21,799
nobody talks about this they're just

457
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:24,080
like you got a stomach bug you know

458
00:18:21,799 --> 00:18:25,120
that's it wait till it's over and then

459
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,720
take a

460
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:29,080
probiotic so that's what they'll say

461
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,159
some of the best functional medicine

462
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:33,080
doctors to be like well you got a

463
00:18:30,159 --> 00:18:35,400
stomach flu um go to the hospital you

464
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:39,080
got a stomach flu and then make sure you

465
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:40,720
get on our probiotics at our clinic or

466
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:44,000
or our doctor's office make sure you get

467
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:46,640
on our probiotics so that's all they do

468
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:52,000
but what people don't realize is that

469
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:57,360
virus is mean really mean so stomach

470
00:18:52,000 --> 00:19:02,799
bugs stomach flues explode they multiply

471
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:07,200
fast real fast thousands upon thousands

472
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:09,720
of replicas then all those bugs end up

473
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:13,159
attaching themselves to everything the

474
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:15,120
stomach lining the dadum lining the

475
00:19:13,159 --> 00:19:18,640
small and top of the small intestinal

476
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:20,960
tract all through and as it's happening

477
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:23,600
if you have a weakened immune system

478
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:27,240
it's not slowing it down it's not

479
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:30,360
stopping it instead that person is now

480
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:32,600
diarrhea they got stomach pains they're

481
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:33,760
really nauseous they got a fever

482
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:36,880
cranking

483
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:39,919
up because their immune system isn't

484
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:42,919
stopping it it's not breaking it down so

485
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:45,799
their immune cells are not there's not

486
00:19:42,919 --> 00:19:48,320
enough immune cells number one to stop

487
00:19:45,799 --> 00:19:50,720
the neuro virus to that degree and if

488
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:53,919
someone has a weakened immune system

489
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:56,600
then they really have very small amounts

490
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:59,400
of immune cells going into this area

491
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:02,400
trying to stop the neuro virus

492
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:05,440
so the neuro virus the stomach flu the

493
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:07,840
stomach bugs what they do is they attack

494
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:10,000
the Linings of the small intestinal

495
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:12,520
tract and this is why people get Pockets

496
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,520
later this is why people get divots

497
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:17,840
diverticulitis diverticulos losis this

498
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:21,520
is why people end up with crohn's later

499
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:24,000
on meaning a trigger to get into Crohn's

500
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,919
where other bugs can actually contribute

501
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,440
it's all about knocking the immune

502
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:29,720
system down allowing other problems to

503
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:32,480
happen there's people who get stomach

504
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:35,240
flu that never have a normal stomach

505
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,919
intestinal tract ever again in their

506
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:38,760
life they don't know how to recover it

507
00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:40,960
they know don't know how to rebuild it

508
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:43,559
they don't know about Mono eating from

509
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:45,320
the medical medium book series they

510
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:47,960
don't know about all these different

511
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:50,240
things they can do they're just stuck

512
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:54,280
their intestinal tra is rocked for a

513
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:56,400
very long time and then if they're older

514
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:58,840
and they're not younger and they're

515
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,480
older it affects them even more because

516
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:04,159
they already have intestinal tract

517
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:07,440
issues on so many levels so the neuro

518
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:10,480
virus explodes and then it attaches

519
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:12,880
itself to the Linings of the intestinal

520
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:15,279
tract and if you're somebody that has

521
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,840
pockets of undigested protein from a

522
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:18,720
weak liver that I talked about in the

523
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:21,279
last episode or if you're somebody

524
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:23,799
that's dealing with anything like

525
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:26,360
putrified rancid fats that are caked

526
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:28,159
along your intestinal tract old fecal

527
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:31,520
matter that's just stuck there and

528
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:36,440
plastered against the intestinal Linings

529
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:38,640
and bad bacteria like strep it all Rises

530
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:41,000
up so the neuro virus and the stomach

531
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:44,080
flu and the stomach bugs go ripping

532
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:47,600
through you and then it awakens all the

533
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:50,559
STP all the staff all the tiny bits of

534
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:52,480
sea that you were keeping under control

535
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:55,600
you know just managing your immune

536
00:21:52,480 --> 00:22:00,360
system was managing all this time and

537
00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:02,159
then what happens is we get triggered

538
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:05,480
now we have all kinds of intestinal

539
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:08,320
tract disturbances years later down the

540
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:10,600
road a month later so as the virus is

541
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,760
ripping through the gut it's clinging to

542
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:15,679
the wall of the intestinal tract and it

543
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:18,720
starts to try to burrow holes inside the

544
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:21,520
intestinal tract just like white lung is

545
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,960
doing to people when they're getting the

546
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:26,320
sea and they're getting the flu and the

547
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:30,000
C and the RSV and the white lung right

548
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:33,919
now and it's going in it's injuring lung

549
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,919
sacks well the stomach flu is

550
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:39,000
created

551
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:40,799
manufactured to injure the lining of

552
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:45,840
your intestinal

553
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:48,880
tract stomach dadum and so forth it's

554
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:50,080
there to scar tissue and burrow and

555
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:55,679
weaken the

556
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:58,640
lining and wake up other predators that

557
00:22:55,679 --> 00:23:00,880
lie inside of our intestinal tract

558
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,880
like the strep and the seiff and

559
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,480
different varieties of staff and the

560
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:07,200
hpylori

561
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:09,640
so as that neuro virus and that stomach

562
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,640
flu is ripping through and exploding and

563
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:13,360
people are having like explosions of

564
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,919
diarrhea and they're sick and they're

565
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:17,480
nauseous and they're throwing up or

566
00:23:14,919 --> 00:23:20,320
they're fevered and they're getting the

567
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:22,360
runs and they're really struggling for a

568
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,559
day or two sometimes a week right now

569
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:25,720
there's one that's ripping through

570
00:23:23,559 --> 00:23:28,880
that's really messing people up and when

571
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:31,520
that's happening it wakes up strep it

572
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:33,440
wakes up SEI it wakes up staff it wakes

573
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:35,080
up other bugs like viruses that could be

574
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:38,159
in the intestinal

575
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:39,919
tract and then it tries to burrow holes

576
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:44,360
in the Linings because that's what it

577
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:47,600
does the bugs go in and they try to

578
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:50,600
destroy tissue so they're cell

579
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:53,559
destroyers the reason why we're having

580
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:55,880
diarrhea and fever and everything else

581
00:23:53,559 --> 00:23:58,840
around it is cuz our body is

582
00:23:55,880 --> 00:24:01,159
reacting and mucus is is being produced

583
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:03,400
off the lining of her intestinal tract

584
00:24:01,159 --> 00:24:05,679
because it's burrowing little holes tiny

585
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:08,120
little divots in her intestinal tract

586
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:11,840
and so our intestinal tract is releasing

587
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:15,720
gobs and gobs of mucus and water and

588
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:19,000
mucus and it's just straming out it's

589
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:22,640
streaming out to try to defend against

590
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:24,919
the Invader but the Invader causes a lot

591
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:27,240
of Havoc reaches a lot reaks a lot of

592
00:24:24,919 --> 00:24:28,440
havoc and a probiotic is not going to

593
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:31,399
fix it

594
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:33,520
after a really bad stomach flu a fever

595
00:24:31,399 --> 00:24:37,159
and also intestinal tract being invaded

596
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:39,480
like that it takes time to heal it takes

597
00:24:37,159 --> 00:24:41,720
time to eat the right Foods it takes

598
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:45,279
time to understand what you're doing and

599
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:46,840
it's critical to keep the immune system

600
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:49,120
strong

601
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:50,279
so I just wanted to show you that right

602
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:54,080
there and there's other stuff to talk

603
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:56,279
about because we are here talking about

604
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:59,760
the fun stuff for sure all right then

605
00:24:56,279 --> 00:24:59,760
move this over a little bit

606
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:05,840
okay it takes a tremendous amount of

607
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:09,080
adrenaline to fend off any bug that's

608
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:12,039
out there right now any kind of flu any

609
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:13,960
kind of C any kind of white lung RSV any

610
00:25:12,039 --> 00:25:15,000
kind of neuro virus or stomach virus it

611
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:18,000
takes

612
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,480
adrenaline heart rate goes

613
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,679
up as you're getting sick your heart

614
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:25,720
rate goes up that's how it works because

615
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:29,480
epinephrine is being released adrenaline

616
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:31,960
is being released to try to protect you

617
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:35,240
but adrenaline itself doesn't help the

618
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:37,080
immune system so what these bugs do and

619
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:40,840
these viruses do that get into us when

620
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:44,000
they get into us our adrenals end up

621
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:46,880
fire alarming it and releasing all this

622
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,480
adrenaline to try to because that's

623
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:51,039
actually this response this automics

624
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:54,159
response that's happening immediately

625
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:56,520
when an Invader enters into our system

626
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:59,399
but as it's happening our immune cells

627
00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:01,080
are struggling even more because we have

628
00:25:59,399 --> 00:26:04,120
so much adrenaline pouring into our

629
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:07,600
bloodstream and immune cells hate

630
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:09,799
adrenaline hate adrenaline it holds them

631
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,960
back it keeps them from functioning as

632
00:26:09,799 --> 00:26:13,880
good as they can function so our immune

633
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:16,200
cells need

634
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:19,159
fuel need

635
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:22,679
fuel and that's why I talk about like I

636
00:26:19,159 --> 00:26:26,159
have my family and my closest friends on

637
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:28,640
protocols I have them on supplements

638
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:31,200
it's critical because when you get sick

639
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:34,039
if you're somewhere and look no one has

640
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:35,840
no one has it perfect where well man you

641
00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:38,399
know what I could be wrong about that

642
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:40,919
there's people on Instagram that they

643
00:26:38,399 --> 00:26:42,880
never have to work a day in their life

644
00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:44,919
right they're young they come for money

645
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:47,120
or something or they're just extremely

646
00:26:44,919 --> 00:26:48,480
wealthy or whatever it is everything's

647
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,640
taken care of and all they have to do is

648
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,760
sleep 12 hours every night they could

649
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:55,039
sleep as many hours as they want they

650
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:56,159
don't have to stress out about work they

651
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:57,760
don't have to they just worry about

652
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,919
their appointments their stress is their

653
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,799
appointments like I'm getting my

654
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:02,720
lymphatic drainage here I'm getting this

655
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:04,559
here I'm doing this here I'm going on a

656
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,960
vacation here with my friends here I'm

657
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:09,159
going to Europe whatever it is that's

658
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:12,120
their stress right and there are people

659
00:27:09,159 --> 00:27:13,679
like that and they can at least protect

660
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:16,039
themselves because they're not living

661
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:17,880
with a lot of real life scenarios

662
00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:20,480
situations they're not trying to work

663
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:22,080
three jobs to survive they don't have

664
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,799
you know like all these problems in

665
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,399
their life meaning from other family

666
00:27:23,799 --> 00:27:27,640
members or something happening and they

667
00:27:25,399 --> 00:27:29,760
don't you know there's a lot going on in

668
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:31,320
a lot of people's lives and we can't

669
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,480
help it because there's so many people

670
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:36,159
that don't have that perfect life life

671
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:37,760
where they can just relax all day long

672
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:39,679
and never have to worry about working a

673
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:41,000
day in their life you know there's a lot

674
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:43,559
of people that are struggling and they

675
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,399
have to fight to survive and when you do

676
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:46,799
that right we're always up against a lot

677
00:27:45,399 --> 00:27:49,240
and it's important to keep our immune

678
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:51,000
system strong and in the eventually

679
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:52,960
someone who has it really good in their

680
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,760
life and they're young and strong now

681
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,480
still will get symptoms later they'll

682
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:58,320
still wind up in trouble they'll still

683
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:01,600
wind up sick I see see it all the time

684
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:04,399
but it usually comes later instead of

685
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:07,039
early let's see sole purpose on IG says

686
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:10,480
my fiance was just sick three times in

687
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:13,640
six weeks flu bug stomach flu bug and

688
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:15,799
then flu bug again now lots of crazy

689
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:17,760
symptoms so he's joined me in medical

690
00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:19,919
medium protocols this week now that's

691
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,880
exactly the example I'm so sorry you're

692
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:22,760
going through that first of all I want

693
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,919
to say that that's awful that's awful

694
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:26,919
but that's how they set it up you have

695
00:28:24,919 --> 00:28:30,840
to understand that's how they set it up

696
00:28:26,919 --> 00:28:32,640
so that's what they do okay so let's do

697
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:34,799
a a different little thing on the

698
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:37,080
Whiteboard okay I don't know why my

699
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:39,600
whiteboard doesn't really work that

700
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:45,240
right I really don't

701
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:45,240
know okay so all

702
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:59,399
right excuse me for my art Artistry

right

707
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:14,120
okay that is the bug manufacturing plant

708
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:16,120
that's what that is that's right that's

709
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:18,960
the bug manufacturing

710
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:20,840
plant yes

711
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:24,880
indeed

712
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:26,159
okay and here are some houses over here

713

some

714
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:30,360
roofs okay okay there's some different

715
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:33,399
houses

716
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:35,760
everywhere um there's a little village

717
00:29:33,399 --> 00:29:39,440
here lots of different roads like this

718
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:40,840
quick art this is really great right

719
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,799
it's a building up here with some

720
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:47,559
chimneys here whatever that's the

721
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:50,360
village The Village the innocent

722
00:29:47,559 --> 00:29:55,039
people okay there it

723
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:57,480
is and the manufacturing plant they just

724
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:59,360
let out all kinds of stuff out there

725
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:02,880
front

726
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:04,120
door is what they do they let out lots

727
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:07,720
of

728
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:10,919
bugs lots of bugs and they do it

729
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:14,519
purposely and they time it just right

730
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:18,519
okay and these bugs end up going to the

731
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:18,519
village and everybody gets

732
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:25,080
sick apologize for my my writing

733
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:29,240
my Artistry

734
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:29,240
skills I did not go to Art School

735
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:36,799
and uh I wish I did I really do anyway

736
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:41,080
listen so check this out you guys bugs

737
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:44,600
are layered on top of bugs purposely so

738
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:47,960
they release them with a

739
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:50,080
schedule okay so there's a

740
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:54,000
schedule there it is

741
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:56,519
here got all the different days of the

742
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,880
month right here's the first here's the

743
00:30:56,519 --> 00:31:02,200
second here's the Third third the fourth

744
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:06,639
the 5ifth each month they release one

745
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:08,639
flu bug on the first of whatever day of

746
00:31:06,639 --> 00:31:11,120
the month they want to release it

747
00:31:08,639 --> 00:31:13,360
on when they know it's gotten out there

748
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:15,159
good enough and it's running its course

749
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:17,559
they time it and they have schedules and

750
00:31:15,159 --> 00:31:19,440
they release another one on another

751
00:31:17,559 --> 00:31:23,679
month maybe they'll release it on the

752
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:27,559
third okay they layer the manufactured

753
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:32,880
bugs purposely so it kicks the crap out

754
00:31:27,559 --> 00:31:36,519
of people they want you to be triggered

755
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:40,039
and injured so you're kept down and you

756
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:43,559
feed the system that's how it's done see

757
00:31:40,039 --> 00:31:46,679
so you catch the one flu six weeks ago

758
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:49,600
you catch another flu three weeks ago

759
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:52,679
you catch the stomach flu last week it's

760
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:54,480
layered they put them out like that and

761
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:58,000
they want everybody in the village to

762
00:31:54,480 --> 00:32:00,960
get sick everybody and they want older

763
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:04,960
people elderly people to

764
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:07,799
die correct they want them to die and

765
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:10,039
get knocked off that's how it's done

766
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:13,760
they want them sick and they want them

767
00:32:10,039 --> 00:32:17,760
gone that's how the system is set up

768
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:17,760
it's a kind of a fun little system isn't

769
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:21,789
[Music]

770
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:27,639
it they manufacture the bugs and they

771
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:29,760
then they stick the bugs in a

772
00:32:27,639 --> 00:32:32,760
containment unit with a bunch of white

773
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:34,679
mice and they see if the mice all die

774
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:37,200
and they see if the mice live they see

775
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:40,679
if the mice chalk you know cough and

776
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:44,399
choke on fleem they see if the mice have

777
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:46,840
diarrhea all around the mouse

778
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:48,679
tank and then they kind of say well

779
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:52,679
we're ready and they eventually let it

780
00:32:48,679 --> 00:32:55,440
out that's the system it's the way it's

781
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:57,360
built lady Kath over there in IG just

782
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,559
said I really appreciate how how you

783
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:01,360

784
00:32:59,559 --> 00:33:04,559
stresses bringing down our immune

785
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:08,760
systems indeed everybody does I am

786
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:11,000
included in that I am not immune to that

787
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:14,799
I have stress just like anybody else

788
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:16,919
plenty of it in fact a lot of it and

789
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:19,080
that's what happens when you have the

790
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:21,559
most healing stories on the planet of

791
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:23,200
people healing you have the most people

792
00:33:21,559 --> 00:33:25,840
with multiple sceris that got out of

793
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:29,320
wheelchairs in

794
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:31,559
history the the information that's so

795
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:33,200
Advanced every single you know somebody

796
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:35,039
who's somebody in the influencer world

797
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,080
is stealing and poaching it and using it

798
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:38,039
because they can't get their own

799
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:40,159
information and all these people are

800
00:33:38,039 --> 00:33:42,799
healing around the world and it creates

801
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:44,279
tremendous amount of stress that's how

802
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:46,480
it works you're not allowed to get

803
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:47,840
people better in large quantities you're

804
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,200
allowed to get one or two people better

805

and be like hey I got somebody better

people better hundreds of thousands of

808
00:33:53,559 --> 00:33:57,360
people better that weren't supposed to

846
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:46,320
this right here do you guys know about

847
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:47,480
this can I show you this is also a

848
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,520
collagen

849
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:51,760
Builder and the one thing about medical

850
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:55,680
medium information is I was the first to

851
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:57,560
blow the horn on the BS [ __ ]

852
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:59,359
collagen Market

853
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:01,760
where the collagen Market was selling

854
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:04,119
all this collagen but you can't build

855
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:07,200
collagen eating collagen just like you

856
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:10,359
can't fix your eye eating an eyeball you

857
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:14,400
can't eat a pig's eyeball to fix your

858
00:36:10,359 --> 00:36:16,760
eyeball you can't eat a liver to fix

859
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:19,640
your liver it doesn't work that's not

860
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:22,680
how it works you can't rebuild collagen

861
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:25,400
in your body you can't rebuild collagen

862
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:27,079
in your body eating collagen it's not

863
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:29,480
going to happen so Medical medium

864
00:36:27,079 --> 00:36:32,160
information was the first to call that

865
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:35,280
out that you can't get better on

866
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:38,440
collagen you can only build your

867
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:40,400
collagen with collagen Builders that's

868
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:43,119
how you do

869
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:44,160
it all right so I got some water heated

870
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:46,040

00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:48,480

incredible okay um so anyway you guys

943
00:39:46,119 --> 00:39:50,839
know about the MSM too that's another

944
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:53,119
thing for the skin which is incredible

945
00:39:50,839 --> 00:39:57,000
skin and joints and everything so the

946
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:58,880
MSM that's an amazing one with silica

947
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,000
and that's a whole game changer all on

948
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:03,240
its own I mean this this is actually

949
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,480
exciting this cheers me up because I've

950
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:06,680
been wanting to talk about some of the

951
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:09,280
things that I'm using my family is using

952
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:12,160
the medical medium Skin Potion have you

953
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:15,440
tried it which is the MSM it's the

954
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:17,160
vitamin C right the micro C and let me

955
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:20,520
just be clear about this so you guys

956
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:23,560
know okay if you're interested this

957
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:26,760
isn't ascorbic acid this isn't the thing

958
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:28,000
that burns holes in people's stomachs

959
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:29,839
that that's what I'm talking about

960
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,760
that's a different difference with

961
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:34,040
fmer that is the difference right there

962
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:36,560
because people don't realize that they

963
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:37,760
go and take the ascorbic acid and next

964
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:39,760
thing you know they got the runs they

965
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:41,880
got diarrhea they got stomach upset it's

966
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:44,000
burning their Linings it's burning their

967
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:45,920
gut if they're sensitive they had ulcers

968
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,200
in the past and they're taking all that

969
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:51,200
ascorbic acid it's sitting there like

970
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:54,200
sizzling up the ulcers like I I can't I

971
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:57,119
can't even go even go there like I will

972
00:40:54,200 --> 00:41:00,079
never take an escor acid straight

973
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:02,079
ascorbic acid vitamin C ever again in my

974
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:04,920
life I've taken it when there was

975
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:06,480
nothing else available out there in the

976
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:10,119
world I've taken it when there was

977
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:13,079
nothing available I will never ever ever

978
00:41:10,119 --> 00:41:17,200
take an escorp Bic a TR scor Bic acid

979
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:19,359

980
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:21,480

981
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:24,040

1097
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:56,480
anywhere science or nowhere they just

00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:58,839
where do they get it they just came out

1099
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:01,839
of thin air where'd it come from I know

1100
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:03,880

out of them yeah I know I know it's

1102
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:07,400
actually sick and then they're running

1103
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:09,440
ads to the medical medium Community with

1104
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:12,240
the medical medium information how sick

1105
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:15,720
is that pretending they came up with it

1106
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:17,599
or something it's actually despicable

1107
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:20,119
like how can people live with themselves

1108
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:22,359
it's because they're they're slimy

1109
00:46:20,119 --> 00:46:24,760

I'm going to put out a stream of them a

1113
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:34,680
steady stream of medical M podcast at

1114
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:36,160
Apple podcast don't miss them make sure

1115
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:37,960

00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:45,559
get notified yeah I know okay okay so

1118
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:49,960
the total immune is really revolutionary

1119
00:46:45,559 --> 00:46:51,760
all on its own okay it's like with me I

1120
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:52,880
I know that people need their immune

1121
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:56,839
system

1122
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:59,839
strengthened but they need them rebuilt

1123
00:46:56,839 --> 00:47:03,839
rebuilt not just fortified not just

1124
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:07,000
strengthened not just supported but

1125
00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:09,000
rebuilt because that's the kind of

1126
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:12,280
immune system trouble so many people are

1127
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:15,400
in thyroid problems hypo hyper you know

1128
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:17,800
nodules cysts on the thyroid whether

1129
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:20,160
they're tiny or large people that deal

1130
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:22,480
with all kinds of issues under the sun

1131
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:24,720
everything from neurological problems

1132
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:26,599
from skin problems our immune systems

1133
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:29,960
are under attack

1134
00:47:26,599 --> 00:47:31,960
from everything from fragrances and

1135
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:33,559
anything people who drink alcohol it's

1136
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:35,880
another thing did you know that it was

1137
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:38,640
taboo you guys on another note can't

1138
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:43,800
help it you know that it was taboo to

1139
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:47,280
either to utter the word you can't do

1140
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:49,480
alcohol like it's bad for you it's not

1141
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:51,839
good for you it's not going to help you

1142
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:54,839
even all the vegan

1143
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:57,559
doctors podcast doctors all drink all

1144
00:47:54,839 --> 00:48:01,440
drink wine champagne everything right

1145
00:47:57,559 --> 00:48:03,599
vodka all drink okay and then suddenly

1146
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:05,680
now years after I've been talking about

1147
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:07,599
how bad alcohol is and I was getting

1148
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:09,240
crap for it that was taboo you weren't

1149
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:10,839
allowed to talk about it on a podcast

1150
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:13,040
anywhere you weren't allowed to talk

1151
00:48:10,839 --> 00:48:15,680
about it on social you mentioned that

1152
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:17,880
alcohol was bad everybody The Gauntlet

1153
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:20,800
came down on you man to chop off your

1154
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:22,280
head I'm not kidding but yet I stayed

1155
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:24,079
with it stayed with it stayed with it

1156
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:26,599
talked about the books stayed with it

1157
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:28,359
was heavy on it said no you can't do

1158
00:48:26,599 --> 00:48:31,119
this if you want to heal you got to get

1159
00:48:28,359 --> 00:48:32,880
off alcohol it's bad for you whatever

1160
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:35,280
and then now guess what they're all

1161
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:36,720
paring it now like yeah alcohol is bad

1162
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:39,520
for your brain really cuz science

1163
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:43,079
doesn't say that where did you get that

1164
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:44,280
idea all right look what I like about

1165
00:48:43,079 --> 00:48:47,480
total

1166
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:49,280
immune okay

1167
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:52,319
is

1168
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:55,119
um the fact that it works that's just

1169
00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:58,040
one right off the the bat me me over

1170
00:48:55,119 --> 00:49:00,359
there on on YouTube I noticed that Mayo

1171
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:03,480
Clinic Now talks about non- rashing

1172
00:49:00,359 --> 00:49:05,480
shingles no mention of the source um

1173
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:07,640
there is a hijacking of the medical

1174
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:11,319
medium non- rashing shingles information

1175
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:13,960
both there at Mayo PubMed wherever all

1176
00:49:11,319 --> 00:49:15,440
of all of it like they've just hijacked

1177
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:17,760
medical medium information with no

1178
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:20,599
science and no studies behind it no

1179
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:23,040
studies behind it and when you look when

1180
00:49:20,599 --> 00:49:24,960
you look at whatever they show check

1181
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:27,480
this out how sick is this when they look

1182
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:31,480
when you look they show they're talking

1183
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:32,720
about post herpetic pain when the rash

1184
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:35,400
goes

1185
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:38,280
away but they're trying to chalk that up

1186
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:40,799
as it it's non- rashing shingles no they

1187
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:42,599
had the rash it went away and then they

1188
00:49:40,799 --> 00:49:44,799
had pain for a year so science of

1189
00:49:42,599 --> 00:49:48,839
research did do a couple of papers where

1190
00:49:44,799 --> 00:49:50,880
you have pain for a year or more after

1191
00:49:48,839 --> 00:49:52,799
shingles but that's not non- rashing

1192
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:54,799
shingles non- rashing shingles is

1193
00:49:52,799 --> 00:49:57,680
medical medium information it's having

1194
00:49:54,799 --> 00:49:59,839
shingles never a rash ever and having

1195
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:02,040
symptoms right well now they're claiming

1196
00:49:59,839 --> 00:50:03,680
they knew that when they didn't no signs

1197
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:05,359
to back it up but mayo and everybody

1198
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:09,720
else is using medical meme information

1199
00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:12,079
on that just CRA it's crazy you know

1200
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:15,359
what there's you know there's good news

1201
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:18,359
though because they're so evil that when

1202
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:21,880
you leave here that evil and you don't

1203
00:50:18,359 --> 00:50:25,040
make good with that you don't resolve it

1204
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:28,480
you don't you don't work on that you

1205
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:30,319
don't clean about like how many people

1206
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:31,920
you screwed over with chronic illness

1207
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:33,799
that couldn't get back to the source to

1208
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:35,359
heal and it's your fault that so many

1209
00:50:33,799 --> 00:50:38,359
people aren't going to heal because you

1210
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:40,559
were evil and you didn't care and you

1211
00:50:38,359 --> 00:50:43,079
stole that information to just

1212
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:46,000
manipulate people and then you're on

1213
00:50:43,079 --> 00:50:48,079
your deathbed many years down the road

1214
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:51,280
you think you're just in the clear with

1215
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:51,280
that you think you're in the

1216
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:57,760
clear I see my medicinal home on YouTube

1217
00:50:55,640 --> 00:51:01,559
propolis shock therapy is in the brain

1218
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:04,480
saver protocol book it helped heal my

1219
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:05,839
canker sorce and that's the propolis

1220
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:07,359
right there I'll give you a close-up on

1221
00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:10,799
the propolis you

1222
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:15,280
guys I mean honestly look if you look if

1223
00:51:10,799 --> 00:51:17,960
if you can get one thing one thing okay

1224
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:21,319
you can't you can't lose with total

1225
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:23,640
immune you can't lose the propolis pure

1226
00:51:21,319 --> 00:51:26,359
if you can get two things it's like

1227
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:28,880
total immune propolis pure

1228
00:51:26,359 --> 00:51:31,920
right if you can get two things that's

1229
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:34,240
how critical that is for our immune

1230
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:36,559
systems right there that's how critical

1231
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:38,640
that is all right you guys we're talking

1232
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:41,200
about all kinds of good stuff flu and

1233
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:44,079
everything else in post flu and post RSV

1234
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:45,359
RSV and white lung and neuro viruses

1235
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:47,640
which are going around and we talked

1236
00:51:45,359 --> 00:51:49,880
about like manufacturing they got the

1237
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:51,960
manufacturing plant right there they're

1238
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:54,440
growing the viruses spawning them right

1239
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:57,359
out of eggs themselves and then they get

1240
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:59,440
released Magic Al into our environment

1241
00:51:57,359 --> 00:52:01,160
and it hits the village right here and

1242
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:02,160
then they calculate it on the calendar

1243
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:03,520
of when they're going to release the

1244
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:05,480
next one and next one because they want

1245
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:07,359
to clobber the crap out of everybody's

1246
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:11,520
immune system and they want elderly

1247
00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:11,520
people to die early so that's the

1248
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:17,240
plan and if you don't believe it then

1249
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:20,400
fine it's all make

1250
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:22,319
believe sure we can think that maybe

1251
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:25,520
it's just all make believe and it never

1252
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:27,680
happens no and that's fine whatever want

1253
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:29,440
to think but yeah it's interesting isn't

1254
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:32,839
it all right so what I'm doing right

1255
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:35,040
here is I am I got my total immune right

1256
00:52:32,839 --> 00:52:37,200
there I take shots of it I put it in the

1257
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:39,520
shot glass just like this

1258
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:40,799
okay and I'm going to pop a little bit

1259
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:42,440
of orange ju so I want to talk about

1260
00:52:40,799 --> 00:52:44,520
this there's a lot of people that even

1261
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:46,000
know these don't taste bad these taste

1262
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:49,319
good some of some of the vimergy

1263
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:52,000
products taste amazing that people don't

1264
00:52:49,319 --> 00:52:54,079
like to use water they can use juice

1265
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:56,000
then so here I got some fresh squeezed

1266
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:59,000
orange juice and pouring in in there it

1267
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:02,160

work 6 pm to 4 a.m. hey you're on my

1312
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:05,480
schedule that's amazing but am often up

1313
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:08,920
until 5 to 6: a.m. how do I need to

1314
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:12,760
supplement my body first and foremost

1315
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:14,599
right always remember that even if

1316
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:16,240
you're not sleeping if you're just

1317
00:55:14,599 --> 00:55:17,839
laying there and you're resting your

1318
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:20,119
nerves and your eyes are shut your

1319
00:55:17,839 --> 00:55:22,839
immune system is recovering just from

1320
00:55:20,119 --> 00:55:24,319
that alone and I want to say this this

1321
00:55:22,839 --> 00:55:26,200
is very important for people who can't

1322
00:55:24,319 --> 00:55:29,599
sleep or can't get enough sleep they're

1323
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:31,720
working hard everything's off right is

1324
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:34,079
that when you're even laying there

1325
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:36,039
you're laying there and you're calm and

1326
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:38,319
you're shutting your eyes your immune

1327
00:55:36,039 --> 00:55:40,559
system is responding and it's

1328
00:55:38,319 --> 00:55:42,119
reproducing and it's building back up

1329
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:43,960
even if you're just laying there you

1330
00:55:42,119 --> 00:55:45,799
guys keep that in mind even if you're

1331
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:47,359

1332
00:55:45,799 --> 00:55:49,640
or you have some kind of sleep issue

1333
00:55:47,359 --> 00:55:52,039
your immune system is sitting there

1334
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:53,559
building and rebuilding up when when

1335
00:55:52,039 --> 00:55:55,599
you're actually just laying there with

1336
00:55:53,559 --> 00:55:58,400
your eyes shut relaxing relxing keep

1337
00:55:55,599 --> 00:56:00,760
that in mind right there okay what I

1338
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:03,799

do and then I I focus on hydration I

1348
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:33,440
focus on a little bit of coconut water I

1349
00:56:30,119 --> 00:56:36,160

00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:56,039
underslept because that's a recipe right

1357
00:56:53,599 --> 00:56:58,960
there for a heart attack right there

1358
00:56:56,039 --> 00:57:01,319

00:58:27,039 --> 00:58:32,440
people stay away from alkaline water

1395
00:58:29,359 --> 00:58:33,799
crap that's out there I've been how many

1396
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:35,720
how many years have I told people to

1397
00:58:33,799 --> 00:58:38,280
stay away from that and look what just

1398
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:40,160
happened I mean it was just terrifying

1399
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:42,760
what just happened to people out there

1400
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:44,760
right it's like you know like there's a

1401
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:47,599
lot of things that I do to keep the

1402
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:51,240
immune system strong and you know what I

1403
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:53,920
do is I eat every couple of hours so

1404
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:55,400
that my adrenals aren't flooding so if

1405
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:56,680
you want to keep your immune system

1406
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:57,799
strong you want to build your immune

1407
00:58:56,680 --> 00:59:00,680
system back

1408
00:58:57,799 --> 00:59:04,200
up you make sure you're not trashing

1409
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:07,599
your adrenals get caffeine out of

1410
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:09,200
there get caffeine out that's critical

1411
00:59:07,599 --> 00:59:11,200
by the way there's no science behind

1412
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:12,720
caffeine hurting the immune system but

1413
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:14,240
recently I saw something out there of

1414
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:15,599
somebody like yeah stay away from

1415
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:17,799
caffeine really because there's no

1416
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:21,039
science that says it they science says

1417
00:59:17,799 --> 00:59:23,000
caffeine is good for you it's

1418
00:59:21,039 --> 00:59:25,799
crazy

1419
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:28,599
so how it is the point is is staying

1420
00:59:25,799 --> 00:59:31,119
away from caffeine eating every couple

1421
00:59:28,599 --> 00:59:33,760
of hours don't intermittent

1422
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:35,720
fast when you want to rebuild your and

1423
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:38,039
recover your immune system don't do the

1424
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:40,039
intermittent fasting where you're on

1425
00:59:38,039 --> 00:59:41,680
coffee all day then you eat a big greasy

1426
00:59:40,039 --> 00:59:43,680
fried meal at the end of the night or a

1427
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:45,799
big overt fat meal at the end of the

1428
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:47,680
night I'm intermittent fasting my

1429
00:59:45,799 --> 00:59:50,480
stomach's staying down I'm not as

1430
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:52,640
bloated at night I could eat what I want

1431
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:54,920
yeah you just trashed your adrenals

1432
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:57,720
people who intermittent fast they seem

1433
00:59:54,920 --> 01:00:00,400
to improve improve but do you hear about

1434
00:59:57,720 --> 01:00:03,960

01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:20,359
and then I tried that and I was trying

1444
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:22,400
this new program that I just purchased

1445
01:00:20,359 --> 01:00:23,960
for $5,000 from this guy that says he's

1446
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:26,400
a chiropractor or something like and

1447
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:28,079
then I just did this and did that and

1448
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:29,640
people are just like they're everywhere

1449
01:00:28,079 --> 01:00:32,400
and it's like Yeah because it didn't

1450
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:34,440
work intermittent fasting burns out the

1451
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:36,839
adrenals so what I like to do is I like

1452
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:40,280
to eat every couple of hours I'll have a

1453
01:00:36,839 --> 01:00:42,960

together I'll have some kale on some dat

1465
01:01:08,119 --> 01:01:11,920
I'm just saying that this is what I do

1466
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:13,640
and it's to keep the

1467
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:15,119
adrenals strong then I'll have some

1468
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:18,240
steamed potatoes later but it'll keep

1469
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:20,839
the adrenals strong and it'll also stop

1470
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:22,480
the adrenals from releasing and that

1471
01:01:20,839 --> 01:01:24,920
lowers the immune system there's so many

1472
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:28,440
